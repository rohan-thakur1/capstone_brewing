2464,"2016-10-10",4.3,"Pours a slightly hazy golden colour with a thin white head. Nose of crackery malts and resiny hops. Taste is crisp and piney, with a medium bitter finish. Amarillo bomb without losing the pilsner malt character. Exceptional.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","lupulist"
2464,"2016-09-24",3.8,"650 ml bottle. Pours a light clear gold with moderate head. Very floral aromas with additional notes of limes and crisp grains. Flavors follow same though emphasis on bitter tropical fruit and super clean grains/malts (maybe rice?). A nice experiment - this could be a killer summer beer.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Gerbeer"
2464,"2016-08-28",3.8,"Bottle - Great citrus and spicy hop notes with a touch of grain. Clear gold with a rich white head. Light hoppy and a nice bitterness in the finish. Very nice and easy drinking, well done.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2464,"2016-08-19",4.0,"This is how I recover after doing sprints. Super light gold with a big solid bright white head. Celery aroma nailed down by Capflu is dead on + I just ate a stick in a salad an hr ago, freshly baked white bread, lemon, tropical notes, slightly dank - all goodness. Awesome flavour - super sharp and attentive, excellent balance of mouth watering lemony hops, dryness and arid grass. Has bite, slight tropical feel. Simple yet incredibly satisfying. This is one of the best beers Ive had this year.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"
2464,"2016-08-07",3.6,"On tap at 12 Kings. Pours a clear golden with a white head. Aroma is malty and tropical fruits. Crispy taste with hoppy bitterness. Very good for a Pilsner.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","beerplace"
2464,"2016-06-10",4.1,"Un pilsner superbe.

Jaune brillante et pale avec une moyenne robe blanche avec excellent rétention qui laisse les belles dentelles. Larôme à plein de céréales, du malt léger, même un peu dépices qui viens dhoublon. En bouche cest très fraîche, avec les céréales dabord, puis du malt pilsen, houblon florale, et une finition sec et légèrement amer. Plein de saveur et complex (pour un pilsner!).","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","vadie"
2464,"2015-09-15",4.0,"Pours a clear gold color with a lasting white head. Has a bit of grassy note and a hint of citrus aroma. Very crisp mildly malty finish. Overall its not that bad. Definitely different from their Keller pilsner. Persephone has never disapointed me. Keep up the good job.","British Columbia, CANADA","Reeko"
2464,"2015-08-24",3.8,"Bomber. Clear straw yellow, lasting white foam. Fruity citric aroma. Taste is floral and grapefruity, lemon citrus, herbal, lean pils malt. Average carbonation, lighter bodied, well hopped for the style, so much so its: LBW (Lagerboys be Wary)","British Columbia, CANADA","Lagerboy"
2464,"2015-08-23",4.6,"Pretty happy to see this in my local store. Pours a large, quick dissipating head atop a light yellow body. Nose of lemon and celery with some undertones of golden delicious apples. The flavour is amazing - zesty lemon, tonic and green pepper. Crisp and clean. Up there with Moon Under Waters Potts Pils. Outstanding. Purchased at Corks & Barrels (formerly Penny Farthing Liquor Store) in Oak Bay.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
2464,"2015-07-26",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2016 650mL bottle, pours a cloudy yellow with a small white head. Aroma is wonderful, with biscuity malt, some grass, crisp hoppiness and crackery malt. Flavour is wonderfully balanced, with loads of grassy hops, crisp crackery malt and a great astringent finish. One of the most flavourful pilsners Ive had. This is truly phenomenal.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2464,"2015-07-26",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2017 2017-01-06, bottle, about 6 months old, 8-4-8-4-17=41Last bottle for the season, still very lively and smooth; still lovely crackery and crisp malt, and still some zesty hops. Balanced and still holding up quite nicely.Wonderful.2016-08-05, draught at 12 Kings, 420+420ml, 7-4-8-5-16=40Compared to the glass at St Augustines, this one doesnt hide the malt so much and it has better balance between hop and malt.Compared to the bottle, it has less carbonation (I prefer the bottle), and still not all of that malt goodness.But its a great beer anyway. And there is some aroma of sunstruck straws.Light, refreshing, dry, soft.2016-08-01, draught at St. Augustines, Vancouver, as Amarillo Pilsner, 414+414ml, 7-4-8-5-17=41Hazy pale blond with green hue. Compared to the bottle, the aroma is milder, but more piney and resinous; the flavor is more herbaceous and grassy; on tap, the hop is more evident and the malt quality a bit less evident. It makes me think of a modern IPA.A different but still excellent beer.2016.07.30, bottle from Brewery Creek, Vancouver, 8-4-9-5-17==43Hazy, pale blond color, with fine perlage and compact head. The aroma is mild, with American resiny hops, crackery malts and summer grass fields; elegant. Off-dry mouthfeel, smooth; the malt flavor is extremely crisp, lean, potent, it perfectly balances the strong hopping, that provides plenty of resins, with orange zest and piney character.Another Pilsner masterpiece by Persephone.2015-07-25, bottle from Brewery Creek, Vancouver, as Gibsons ""B"" Pilsner, 9-4-8-5-17=43Hazy blond color, pale shade, with fine perlage, medium sized compact head, perfect persistence for a Pilsner, I just wish I had a Pilsner glass for once. Elegant aroma, there is grass and some citrus peel, dry hay, sunny, very interesting and unique; after some time, it just keeps developing and delivering more aromas of summer fields. Good structure; dry mouthfeel; very good malt flavor, crisp, a bit bready and cereally; strong bitterness; the final is herbaceous, with hints of chamomile and piney resins, cedar peel, infinitesimal incense.Excellent Pilsner, atypical maybe, but excellent.Im going down to the shop and buy some more.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
2464,"2015-07-25",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2016 Amarillo Pilsner. Hazy flaxen colour.  Medium bubbly head.  Big lemon verbena nose with bready pale malts.  Very appetizing.  Rich, citrusy bitterness, exceptional clean pale malts.  Just perfect balance.  Long, hoppy, lemony finish.  This might actually be better than last year.  Goddamn. Gibsons ""B"" Pilsner:  Bottle, Legacy. Hazy and pale with a big head. The aroma is herbaceous, big hops and clean pale malt. Very herbal, fairly dry but with a touch more sweet pale malt than the Keller Pils. Really nice. Drinks so beautifully - bit of minerals, lots of hops, brilliant balance. Another smash hit from BCs lager gods. 8-4-9-5-17 = 4.3","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
