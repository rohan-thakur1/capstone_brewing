Was really looking forward to this one. Thought that the base Peanut Butter Milk Stout was probably the best peanut butter beer I ever add. Throw in that with Mexican chocolate and even stronger (7.5 compared to 5.3) and I was all in.

Poured a black color with two fingers of thick, tan, rocky head when I got it. Excellent thick foamy lacing. Good retention. (Sight - 4.25)

Smelled creamy peanut butter, chocolate, light notes of caramel, milk chocolate and cocoa. (Smell - 4.50)

Just such a good tasting beer. Getting peanut butter, thick chocolate, cocoa, semi-sweet morsels, creamy vanilla, hints of spice and chocolate covered peanut butter candy. (Taste - 4.25)

Full body. Sticky, thick texture Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.50)

I really liked this. I think I may have underrated it a tad. Will definitely give it another go. (Overall - 4.25)
