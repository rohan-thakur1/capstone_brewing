2013,"2017-01-15",3.8,"32oz crowler pours with a dark mahogany colored body that supports a lasting nearly tight tan head of foam. The aroma offers up highly roasted coffee, a bit of earthy coffee, a dash of nuttiness and then a malt sense toward the end of the draw. The taste starts off on the sweet side before my palate catches up to the roastiness thatÂ’s going on here. I get sweet malts leading quickly to sweet nuttiness and then progressively darker and darker roasted coffee notes. After a few sips the flavors begin to meld into a pretty nice harmony and balance as the sweetness is mostly balanced by the dark roastiness from the coffee. Nice.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
2013,"2016-11-14",3.3,"I had the nitro version. Difficult to screw up a nitro coffee brown. This one was ok, light and boring. Not enough coffee.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
2013,"2016-09-04",3.6,"A dark reddish copper brown ale with a thick nitro brown head. In aroma, nice caramel malt with nice touch of coffee, nutty notes, pleasant. In mouth, a nice caramel malt with balanced coffee grind, light vinous character , light mineral notes, very nice. On tap at brewery","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
2013,"2016-03-19",3.6,"Nitro draft at the source. Deep chocolatey brown hue with a dense tan cap. Flavor has more of that funky arabica bean goodness-- sort of earthy and green. Bigger flavor up front; finish is rather mild and clean, with lingering cocoa and toasted oats. Very smooth.","","PartyFowle"
2013,"2016-01-19",4.0,"Draft at Fate. Dark maroon color, tan head with good retention and solid lacing. Aroma of brownies dipped in coffee. Taste is coffee, malted milk balls, but still has its beeriness.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
2013,"2016-01-14",4.1,"Taster. Clear brown with tan head. Coffee on the nose. Well balanced malt and coffee with hazelnuts. Nitro creamy and smooth. Excellent!

2013,"2015-11-11",3.8,"On tap. Dark black / brown with a creamy tan head. Aroma is chocolatey and roasted coffee. Has a nice slightly nutty malt base with some chocolate and some roasted coffee notes towards the finish. Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and some nice lacing. Overall pretty tasty.","Elk Grove, California, USA","bnoel09"
2013,"2015-11-02",3.8,"Draft at Tap & Bottle. Pours like a rich dry stout with a long lasting head of tiny bubbles. The aroma is rich coffee with sweet malt. Flavor is espresso with an interesting fruity streak like tart cherries plus some sweetness. Very tasty.

2013,"2015-04-22",3.9,"Draft at tasting room. Attractive mahogany color with a frothy light tan head. No bitterness. Minimal roast even. Hint of fruitiness. Really clean smooth coffee. Caramel. Nothing too assertive hijacking the beer. Light body. Great drinkablity. Very nice. This is a nice example of integrating coffee into beer. Well made.","Arizona, USA","beerbaaron"
2013,"2014-03-20",3.2,"Light red-brown pour with minimal off-white head. Aroma of mildly sweet malt, caramel, and coffee. Flavor is slightly bitter coffee, woody dryness, and toffee.","Arizona, USA","JustDrinkIt"
2013,"2013-08-18",3.9,"On tap at Fate Brewing Co. Pours a somewhat occluded mahogany with a very thin head. Sharp, loamy, almost herbal coffee nose. Lovely earthy coffee taste with a bold, roasty, spiced bite on the back end; a light, nutty, caramel flavor that meshes well with the coffee. Light body. A fine coffee brown.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
2013,"2013-08-17",4.0,"On draught at Fate. Pours clear mahogany with a khaki head. Aroma is astringent coffee and some berries. Taste is sweet, with some cafe au lair notes. Toasty bitterness. Thinner bodied and a bit dry. Good.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","dcschiller"
2013,"2013-03-04",4.1,"Guest tap at Fate brewing, dark brown pour, roasty and coffee aroma with a rich coffee and chocolate flavor.  Tasty brew!","Chandler, Arizona, USA","JPDurden24"
2013,"2013-03-02",4.1,"Sampled @ AZ Strong Beer Fest.  Dark roasted Starbucks, chocolate-covered Kona bean, and bitter grounds.  Rich yet sharp.  Eye-crossing, high-end coffee, cocoa, slight vanilla, Godiva, and molasses.  Absolutely assertive, bordering aggressive.  Hell, this is down-right combative!   Punches you in the throat, provides a forearm shiver to the temple, and kicks you in the nuts.  Sounds painful but remember: no pain, no gain.  Will take a trip out to visit these guys!  More than solid.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
2013,"2013-02-28",4.1,"Nice brown ale, with robust coffee taste. Pours very dark brown. The coffee taste is quite good, but overpowers the ale a bit. Would like to taste more nuttiness. However, pretty good overall.

2013,"2013-02-28",4.1,"Rick brown pour at the AZSBF. Huge coffee aroma followed by roasted nuts and a light cocoa note. Flavor is loaded with coffee, light malty sweetness and more coffee. Awesome.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
