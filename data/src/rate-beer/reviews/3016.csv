3016,"2016-12-11",2.6,"Tasted cold. Pour is very clear, colorless and leaves some tiny legs on the glass. Nose is of sweet ""something"", in beer I would call that sherry/oxidation and raw white alcohol. Some green apples. Taste is indeed a little sweet with some starchy rice flavors. Crushing alcohol. All my sake experiences so far have been boozy/hot messes, maybe Im not a sake guy? This one is a bit less intense on the rubbing alcohol, though, and more enjoyable because of that. Still a long way from being something I would go out of my way for, though... Moderate body, a lot of drying alcohol. Maybe I just dont get it? Ill try to warm the remainder of this bottle now...","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
3016,"2016-09-30",3.1,"Bottle - Touch of melon. Clear. Light, sweet and pretty tasteless. Not horrible if you have never had sake before. No complexity at all.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
3016,"2011-04-16",2.4,"355 ml bottle.  Pours crystal clear.  Taste is of rice, a hint of alcohol and some sour fruit.  Similar aroma.  Very easy to drink.  Is a bit on the watery side and has a slight dryness to it.  Not a bad sake for the price.","Lander, Wyoming, USA","scooterbub"
3016,"2011-04-10",3.0,"Bottle as shown. Pours a clear color. The aroma is pepper and grain. Thin mouthfeel with a rice and mint with coconut. A good sake.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3016,"2010-09-20",3.3,"bottle, thanks to mar, clear in color with long lasting legs, raw coconut aromas, flavors are dry, bitter, creamy melon with a wooden nickel finish","Dallas, Texas, USA","blutt59"
3016,"2010-09-19",2.4,"9/12/10.  375mL bottle.  My first namasake!  Clear pour.  Faint, creamy rice and marshmallow aroma tainted by sourness and alcohol.  Light flavor with a bit of steamed rice, but again tainted sour, almost lemon peel, and a big hint of alcohol... but at the same time, its watery.  Bleh.","Georgia, USA","drowland"
3016,"2010-08-17",2.6,"(187ml bottle thanks to mar) clear, thick huge lasting legs, nose of honey, alcohol, vanilla, rice. Taste of fusel alcohol, subtle banana, rice, oily body, semi-dry finish.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
3016,"2010-08-17",2.7,"Clear with nice legs.  Honey, alcohol, light nuts, not much else.  Nice thickness,  flavor is big on alcohol, light florals, and a slight honey finish.","Dallas, Texas, USA","mar"
3016,"2009-01-24",2.7,"375mL screw top bottle. This was such a fraudulent sake.  Everything about it was just so fake.  The flavor was rather watered down, which is very difficult to say about sake.  It was cheap booze with some rotten vegetables and out of season berries.  The color was a slick clear, I could not believe clear could be so unclear.  This is so the Bud or Miller of Sake.  Once I get more comfortable with Sake, I feel I will rate this even lower.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
3016,"2008-04-16",2.0,"The aroma is ricey with some fruit and lots of alcohol. The appearance is clear. The flavor is like the aroma and strong. The palate is oily. Overall its unique.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
3016,"2008-04-16",2.0,"This is quite a different tasting sake than others I have had. you can really taste the brewing water with the sake flavor in the background. Anyway it just barely drinkable","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
3016,"2008-04-07",1.8,"Not much for legs as this ran quickly down the sides of the glass. The aroma is medicinal with some earthy grass. The taste has notes of old sweat socks and weird dandelions. The finish is alcoholic and almost makes me cringe. After drinking a little more, the finish reminded me of a vodka martini with an olive. Strange. A little rough for my taste.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
3016,"2007-11-07",2.5,"Aroma much like the Hakutsuru Draft Sake. I agree that in this case the fruit is detectably banana aroma (n-amyl acetate, which probably counts as a fusel).  For me there is a methanol note. Do sake drinkers go blind? Hope not. Very slight gold tint in clear water for color. No carbonation. Nearly medium in body. Many fruit flavor variations, but the alcohol renders identification difficult. There is wood or nut hull. The finish is dry, and a bit woody. The alcohol is strong. Im probably a low alcohol sake kind of fellow. But a 14% ale? Oh yeah.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
3016,"2007-04-30",2.5,"Light tint of yellow in the still, thin looking liquid. Very small leg, seems to dry off the glass. Bananas, butter, almond paste and coconut in the aroma. Quite thin in flavor with light almond followed by a mild gin alcohol. Hints of cola in the linger. If you like alcohol flavors this isnt bad.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
3016,"2007-04-21",2.6,"Just the slightest hint of green.  Smells like this really buttery icing my mom makes for hot crossed buns, plus wood and a bit of starch & alcohol.  Light wood and alcohol dominate the palate, with some peachy-pear notes playing a supporting role.  Otherwise fairly neutral, unexciting. BCLDB, Main & 28th","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
3016,"2006-11-26",2.9,"Bottle chilled At Cock & Bull, Sarasota, FL. Pours clear color. Moderate green citrus alcohol aroma. Light body with a dry texture and wine like legs on glass. Light sweet flavor with a light sweet smooth alcohol finish.  Smooth dry sake that would go well with spicy food.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3016,"2006-06-19",2.5,"Bottle from LCBO vintages- This one pours watery clear. Smells like vegetal vodka. Melting tires and white pepper. Boozey taste (vodka mixed with miso soup?) and weird fruity metal taste too. I gotta get better at these sake descriptors. Not one of the best around. Very heated.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"
3016,"2006-04-23",1.5,"6.3oz Bottle: Found amongst the other mini-white zin bottles at a corner grocery mart. Crystal clear color. Nose of sweet sewage, butter, nutty with notes of toothpaste and nuttela. The flavor is hot with some cotton and a thick melted plastic mouthfeel. Finishes long and bad, just coats the mouth and throat with this bad funkyness. Yuck!","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3016,"2006-04-03",2.9,"Cork and Bottle Liquors, Baton Rouge, La. - 6.3 oz bottle - served chilled. Vodka clear, with a sheen. Boiled rice aroma, some peaches as well. Smooth, crisp flavor. Some ripening fruit notes, nectarines, some candy - like those little valentines hearts. Odd, but Ipick up somoe choclate in the very back end. Smooth palate. All around, pleasant. Alcohol hidden well.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
3016,"2005-11-09",2.5,"Green 375 bottle drink cold on the label
a must do! I got rubbing alcohol notes as I sniffed this stuff but I then poured it over crushed Ice,the harsh alcohol went away and some banana came out. The taste is hot and neutral and potent.
I thought it very bland but good shooter material (ice cold)","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","beerhandy"
3016,"2005-11-09",2.6,"375ml screwtop bottle.  Pours clear and swirls thin like water.  Served slightly chilled.  Semi sweet and lightly creamy aroma of almonds (stole that from the rating below, but it’s spot on), vanilla, and some milky, taffy-like sugar scents.  Light and crisp first on the lips, flavorless initially, then it brightens and gets a bit rough - slight burn on the lips and the back of the mouth.  Sharp, slightly sour, grain alcohol and chemical flavored.  More liquor like than I prefer in a sake.  Still doesn’t come near a nigori.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3016,"2005-09-02",3.3,"clear water pour with an almond and alcohol nose  with a touch of vanilla. vanilla flavor that is dry. im not getting the banana flavor i was promised here. just a berry flavor in the finish. very smooth beverage","Montana, USA","Kevin"
3016,"2005-02-10",2.8,"Sample from 375 ml clear bottle. Clear with a slight pink tinge that may have been my imagination. Fruity and lightly herbal aroma. Sweet, lightly sour, and a light alcohol finish. Medium to full bodied, lightly oily mouthfeel.","Halifax, Nova Scotia, CANADA","OKBeer"
3016,"2004-05-11",3.4,"(Bottle)  Pours a cystal clear color (like water).  Has a smooth, dry palate.  Flavor of rice and a hint of banana.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
