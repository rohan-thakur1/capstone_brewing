3797,"2017-05-28",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 29, 2017 375ml pours a pale golden straw color with a finger of white foam. Nose is bitter citrus peel and pith with classic arthur rustic grain, floral fieldgrass, soft lavender, tart lemon and traces of pineapple and stonefruit. Palate follows with nice blend of juicy brett and rustic grain. Harmoniously wrapped in some vinous oak influence that lingers in the background. Tart, slightly bitter and delicious with the most focused yet soft mouthfeel I may have ever experienced. Carbonation is dialed in to perfection. Trying not to chug this and enjoy it but every sip gets bigger and bigger.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
3797,"2017-05-23",4.3,"Lighter gold pour, hazy, smaller white head. Oak, citrus aroma, funky, light tartness. Lighter citrus up front, lemon zest, light grape, toasted malt, oak, rustic, light cellar notes. Lighter body. Extremely approachable. Un Gros Merci!","","Johnsense"
3797,"2017-05-22",4.0,"Bottle. Clear yellow pour with a white head. Tasty with grassy/floral highlights. Rustic with subtle vinous hints. Good body and mouthfeel. Tasty, thanks Collin.","Florida, USA","50belair"
3797,"2017-05-07",4.5,"Bottle via trade from my good buddy Aaron! Pours a lightly hazed golden color with a small white head. Light effervescent touch. Aromas are of light floral bouquet, delicate funk, lemon zest and a touch of oak. Taste follows the nose but this really hit all the marks! Hard to find many flaws here....if any. Loads of character in the form of a soft herbal note into a light lemon tartness. Nice hints of funk and oak throughout. Mild acidity. Damn this is soft! Not quite as dry as regular Arthur but not as tart nor acidic as Art. I may even prefer this to both! Usual light mineral note in the profile, soft yeast gives more depth and light dried fruit esters. Another superb Farmstead offering!","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"
3797,"2017-05-04",4.6,"Best surprise of the night. Still a saison, yet so complex. A dial back of the wine character allows for more malt and yeast notes to shine through adding to the complexity. My main complaint about this is that a 375 size bottle is a cruel joke. Not even enough for me.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3797,"2017-05-03",4.0,"Bottle shared with Nelson at the brewery on 3/22/17.Vibrant golden-brass body shows low haze and a large, white head atop of moderate retention.Very soft nose, much softer than Arthur as obviously the fresh hops in that one have had some time to soften up. Still get a little bit of lemon-lime twang that turns me off of fresh Arthur, but its very minimal. Instead, tons of minerality, juicy Brett and soft oak notes emerge in its place. Very sniffable and well-constructed nose with no heavy acidity, toasted oak, alcohol or flaw.In the mouth its quite tart, nicely dry and full of zippy Brett and lactic character. Soft oak and wood helps even things out and the hops in the nose are only faint here. Tight carbonation, as usual, concentrates many of the flavors and yet keeps the finish crisp and quenching. Maybe even a touch of sulfur in there. Lovely stuff, more like Art than Arthur, in my opinion, and thats certainly fine by me.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3797,"2017-04-20",4.2,"Tried in a blind, side-by-side taste test with a bottle of base Arthur (that was about 9 months old). Arthur Puncheon was excellent, with a complex flavor profile of fruity and funky Brett, apples, biscuit malt, and light hop bitterness. To my surprise, though, it tasted extremely similar to regular Arthur -- only about half of the people could tell them apart, and the ones who could only noticed small differences. This is fantastic, just like Arthur.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

3797,"2017-04-15",4.0,"375ML Split 2-ways. in stemware

A - Pours a very yellowish gold with a single finger head and a little bit of lacing, its slightly cloudy. 

S - Smells delicious. Very close to base arthur, malty with honeysuckle flowers, mangoes and peach.

T - Hmmm, delicious. This is a more oak forward and dry version of regular Arthur. A little bit of orange peel, a tasty finish.

M - Good carb, spritz and dense. Quite chick compared to regular Arthur

O - This is delicious. Really great but a case of Arthur is as good as one of these Arthurs. Still excellent. Looking forward to aging one bottle.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
3797,"2017-04-07",4.2,"Bottle (375 ml) at home. Split 3-ways with Minderbinder and JulienHuxley. Clear bright golden with a small white ring of white foam leaving good lacing. Aroma is bright with juicy citrusy hops, light buttery oak, winey notes, Arthur farmhouse character and light lemony notes. Taste is citrus forward with buttery oak, beautiful farmhouse character and HF minerality, winey notes and light herbalness. Light-medium body. Medium carbonation. Oaky mouthfeel. Mineral and juicy finish. The description is pretty good, not quite Arthur (more buttery oak forward), not quite Art (less winey) but extremely bright with fun buttery oak notes and beautiful minerality.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3797,"2017-04-07",4.3,"Bottle shared with Tom and Cory. Hazy gold pour with thin lacy white head. Aroma is nice and winey, super fruity, juicy hoppy aromas, super hoppy actually, floral notes, pineapple, chardonnay. Taste is tart, fruity, juicy, light milky buttery oak notes, very smooth. Palate is light-med bodied with light carbonation. Very tasty.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
3797,"2017-04-06",4.5,"Bottle at Hill Farmstead. Hazy golden orange. Smells funky, acidic, grainy. A little oak and wine. Tastes much more winey. Lemon tartness. Oak. Grain. Lots of wine and an oaky finish. Medium body with medium carbonation. Delicious. Arthurs best characteristics remain with enough barrel influence to make it truly special.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3797,"2017-04-05",4.2,"375ml bottle shared with brother, thanks for the beer. Aroma: big citrus, green apples, green grapes, vinous a lot. App: hazy light golden, minimal white head, little lacing. Taste and palate: light body, vinous, moderate dry puckering acidity finish. Overall: thirst quenching! Really refreshing beer. Really easy to drink. Could have drank this in a record time if I wasnt interrupted by the kids every 15 seconds. Anyway, great beer. Not sure its worth the price as the regular Arthur is already good, just less vinous than this one.","St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Stoned99"
3797,"2017-04-02",4.2,"Got in a BIF from Roguer. 375 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 8/24/2016. Pours lightly hazy pale golden yellow color with a 1 finger dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big lightly tart lemon, lime, green apple, peach, pear, pineapple, melon, peppercorn, white wine, oak, hay, straw, herbal, floral, grass, wheat, and cracker; with light leather, musty funk, white vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, oak, and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big lightly tart lemon, lime, green apple, peach, pear, pineapple, melon, peppercorn, white wine, oak, hay, straw, herbal, floral, grass, wheat, and cracker; with light leather, musty funk, white vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness. Light-moderate yeast/tannic oak spiciness and fruity/lactic tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart lemon, lime, green apple, peach, pear, pineapple, melon, peppercorn, white wine, oak, hay, straw, herbal, floral, grass, wheat, cracker, light funk/vinegar, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy/funky yeast, oak, and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/tart/spiciness balance; and zero astringent/puckering flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from tart/spiciness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp/grainy/sticky, and fairly acidic/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 6%. Overall this is an outstanding saison! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance fruity/spicy/funky yeast, oak, and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink. Outstanding Brett complexity, great oak presence, and a solid malt backbone to balance. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
3797,"2017-03-27",4.3,"Bottle care of Al, pours a hazy yellow golden with small head. Notes of sour lemonade, oak, citrus fruits, minerals, and complex earth. Pretty sour like a lot of the smaller variant bottles coming out of Hill. I cracked a Cascade dry hopped Arthur that was 13 months old next to this, and most of us slightly preferred that one which is stupid fucking good right now. This one is really nice though.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3797,"2017-03-25",4.6,"Bottle split 3 ways at the brewery. Slightly hazy pale golden color with foam floating on top. Aroma is light grass, dry bread, mild lemon, pepper, herbal, oak. Taste is pleasantly tart smooth and refined. I prefer this over Arthur and Art. This retains the perfect hill farmstead palate that is sometimes lost in the barrel aged beers but retains the light simple complexity","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
