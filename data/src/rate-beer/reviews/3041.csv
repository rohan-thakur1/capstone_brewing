Picked this up with basically a $50 gift certificate for my birthday. Had heard of Midnight Sun and saw on one of the emails that they had a few coming in, so I pounced on this and the Berserker Imperial Stout. $19.99 (Berserker) and $17.99 (AD) seems a bit much but I got them anyway. Gave Berserker an overrated 4.16 (93/A-) back in January. Hoping for this to be better. 

Poured a copper/garnet cloudy color with one finger of khaki white frothy head. Some light bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Good spotty lacing. Good retention. (Sight - 3.75)

Smelled pent up bourbon, almost port wine like, dark fruits, plum, tobacco, raisins, sticky toffee, caramel, brown sugar, maple syrup, some oaky red wine barrels and earthy basement aromas. Lovely. (Smell - 4.50)

Taste was at least just as good as the nose. Wow. Lots going on. Got smooth bourbon, port wine, sherry red wine, tobacco, unknown lingering spices (rye? maybe pepper?), brown sugar, maple syrup, toffee, plum, dark fruits, raisins, dates, prunes, dark grainy malts, caramel, smooth, but tasting the booze, oak, hints of molasses and sticky sugary chocolate syrup which seems to be muted somewhat by everything else going on. (Taste - 4.25)

Medium body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 5.00)

This was fantastic. Much better than I thought it was going to be after having Berserker a few months back. Would not pay $18 for this again, but still delicious. (Overall - 4.50)

Pours hazy dark ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with solid retention, that reduces to a small spotty lace cap that lingers. Slight spotty lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, coconut, vanilla, bourbon, oak, leather, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/toasted malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Light-moderate booziness as it warms, but not too bad. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, caramel, toffee, butterscotch, toast, coconut, brown sugar, molasses, brown bread, bourbon, oak, vanilla, leather, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness. Light oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, caramel, butterscotch, molasses, toffee, toast, coconut, vanilla, brown sugar, bourbon, oak, leather, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/yeast/barrel balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, fairly slick, and slightly syrupy/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light-moderate warming lingering after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged English barelywine style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; and smooth to sip on for the huge ABV.

3041,"2015-02-26",4.0,"Bottle: 2007 vintage. Thanks, Ed. Was a little over 5 years old at the time of opening. Dark mahogany color with a brash haziness. A thin, light-tan layer of foam evades the top & quickly forms a tiny ring. Good to see any sign of carbonation at all, really. Aroma loaded with oak, bourbon, sweet plums, black cherries, light maple syrup, brown sugar, & molasses. Very sweet, very complex. Malty dimepiece. No signs of oxidation in the aroma OR in the flavor. Thick, muddled, heavy body. Very strong sweetness, albeit controlled & refined. Dark brown sugar, molasses, maple, anise, plums, dates, red grapes, black cherries, buttery toffee, light vanilla, &a robust helping of alcohol. Finished & lingers with candied dark fruits, sticky caramel, & oak. Warming, but not hot. Sweet, but not cloying. Delicious & woody. Great barley wine. 
Bottle: 2011 vintage thanks to Mike. A little over 3 years old. A lovely barley wine all around, as expected. A little more carbonation & actually a slightly thinner mouth feel than I remember. Heavier bourbon flavor, lots of anise & bourbon with a large oak & toffee presence. Heavy dark fruits, as usual, too. Prefer the older vintage but this was still great.
Bottle: 2013 vintage, thanks to Steve. Somewhere between 1 to 2 years old. Much smoother than expected. Boozy, sure, but not abrasive at all.

Bottle. After reading Prufrocks gloriously crunk review of Anchorage Deal with the Devil (Ive been there -- I love that feeling too!) I had to bust out my own 100/99 barrel aged Alaskan barleywine. Im very glad I did. At one year of age this has to be peaking. Im sure it needed a year, but it also clearly will not improve from here.

Pours a rich viscous sienna into my snifter with a small and ephemeral head. The nose: tons of vanilla and barleywine sweetness. Age on the hops, but only slight to hit that sweet spot between bitter bite and aged hop cheese. The bourbon is all vanilla and no booze. How do they do that? The flavor is warm and sweet, hops aged just right and bringing their bitterness only way after the finish and even then still dancing with the sugars. And all of that lovely vanilla oak. The palate is ridiculously smooth, basically zero heat. If it wasnt thick like a perfect ristretto Id think it was closer to 8% than 13+. Even so Id have called it at 10 or 11. This is pretty much a perfect BA barleywine. 
If I wanted to complain, Id have two avenues. The first is that Im bored of high alcohol beers. But thats a case of ""Its not you, its me."" The other much more damning complaint is that it doesnt have its own unique character. Its beautiful exactly the way that an average or composite of many womens faces is beautiful ( highbrow link: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2435688/ ). But yeah, you know youd hit any of those --- so its pretty thin grounds on which to complain. 

tl;dr summary. Perfect BA barleywine. Yawn.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

The appearance had a fairly dark brown body with a half finger white foamy head that quickly dies to a film coating the top of the body. Lacing is there but a bit messy and all over the place.
The smell has a huge sweet aroma of roasted malt intricately combined within a molasses, vanilla, coffee-ish complexity, light caramel and a subdued alcohol note take a secondary place.
The taste is sweet through previously mentioned flavors, but yet balances through some bitter coffee notes. Light black licorice seems to come through in the flavoring, black licorice aftertaste but done nicely and not overbearing, dry finish.
The palate was a medium to heavy, more of a sipper than drinkability. Carbonation seems to be done very well for an English Barleywine and is pretty good to me.

Pours a dark, burnt amber with some brown hues with a small, somewhat thin tan head that recedes fairly quickly to the edges where it lingers a bit. Light lacing and fairly long legs. 
Flavor has a fairly strong malt character and light sweetness. Lots of dark toast, caramel, toffee along with some biscuit and cracker. Medium fruit notes of plum, fig, prune and raisin; surprisingly fruity for a barleywine. Moderately strong bourbon character with some light oak. Moderate bitterness and medium light oxidation. Moderate alcohol spice in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Medium astringency and medium alcohol warmth.

3.5/4.5/3.5/2.5/3.5-3.6
Vintage 2011, ABV 13.4%
Pours a dark amber body with fleeting tan head, leaving a sheet of the same. Caramel, vanilla, oak, bourbon, Brandy(?), seafoam, hints of leather and sherry oxidation. Flavor is similar to the nose, but less impressive and there is an alcoholic tinge to the finish. Thin bodied and low carb, the booze is evident on this one and leaves a burn. This is a good beer, but my favorite was the 08, sadly I didnt review back then, but I recall a fuller body and more refined character in the beer. As it stands, I would advise trying this beer, but not really seeking it out particularly hard, unless youre ChadQuest or other peeps that really dig the BA BWs.","Spokane, Washington, USA","harrymel"

Needed a bit of time to open up once it was poured into the glass but once it did the aroma was delicious - vanilla, sweet caramelize malts and brown sugar, booze is mellow and well integrated, a bit of balsalmic glazed figs.

3041,"2013-05-25",3.4,"Poured into a perfect pint. 2008 vintage.

4.0 A: Clear darker amber color. Aggressive pour yielded just one finger of light brown creamy/frothy head. Retention is okay given the ABV and a short ring of lacing is left.

4.5 S: Nose on this is divine. Perfect mix between the barrel and the beer. Bourbon is fruity, leathery, and lightly earthy. Oak and vanilla with no tannic astringency. The base offers a ton of caramel, moderate toffee, tobacco, raisin, dates, prunes, sugar plums, and apple. Sweet sugary maltiness, molasses, and some toastiness. Alcohol is non-existent.

3.5 T: Taste is a bit of a let down after experiencing the nose. Dont get me wrong, its still tasty, but the mouthfeel is a bit too thin, which causes issues in the taste. Basically, the taste isnt as potent as Id like. Same flavors as in the nose, just less intensity. Leathery bourbon, earthiness, and light fruits. Caramel, toffee, tobacco, raisin are strongest. Prunes, sugar plum, molasses, and toastiness next. Apple underneath. Moderately sweet with just a light booziness. Borderline 4.0.

3.0 M: Lighter medium to medium body. Good moderate carbonation, especially for a beer this old. Missing creaminess and body. If this were a bit thicker, the taste would be better too.

4.0 D: Its a good beer that just has one fatal flaw. Great flavors, but I need more maltiness when Im drinking a barleywine. Ill have to try this fresh sometime.

Taste is much like the aroma, though more subtle than I would have thought going into it, and the alcohol and barrel notes come in really strong. I like the flavor, but this is a pretty hot beer and I think it sort of detracts from the flavor. There also could be way more complexity to such a big beer, and the palate could be more substantial. Carbonation is moderate. Finish is also a little unidimensional of alcohol. Enjoyable enough, and warrants the score, but lacks refinement. Still, Id probably try it again.

A-- Poured a dark but clear amber. Settled a near black color. Somewhat black and somewhat brown. No ruby with this, just an odd but neat sort of color. One finger light brownish yellow head that had somewhat of a glow to it. Very neat looking. Head fell to film and stuck at film through drinking, leaving a yellow brown film at the bottom of the glass. 

S-- Whisky, oak, stewed plumbs, figs, old leather, tobacco, red wine. First time in a long time I thought I was smelling a wine. Excellent. 

T-- Whisky, oak, dark fruits, (started to get apricots), leather, tobacco, and port. Whisky and oak drop off and leave a combo of the leather, tobacco, fruits and port. Flavors changed and came in waves. 

M-- Thick and rich. Very chewy. Left tannins on my gums. Just warmth from the alcohol, it feels every bit the 13.4 % but hides it in the feel so very well. Well balanced and just plain decadent.

3041,"2012-03-15",3.5,"From notes.

The beer itself is a full brown color, although it is somewhat transparent.  A small off-white head fades to a ring and a swirl of a thin film on top.

The aroma has a bit of ethyl alcohol that is noticeable right away.  Brown sugar, caramel, toffee, and a bit of earthy spice come into the nose.

Arctic Devil is definitely sweet up front, but ends up being nicely balanced.  Brown sugar is the most prominent sweet flavor.  Sweet caramel is also noticeable, and there is some full grainy notes.  A bit of peat and spice come in the middle, with a light general bitterness that accompanies a bit of an alcohol presence at the end.  

Surprisingly, this has kind of a light body for the style and feels a little watery.  The carbonation is on the light side and is a little creamy.

This clearly does not drink like 13.4%, but there is an ethyl alcohol presence that is a bit unappealing at this point.  Some age might improve this.  The light mouthfeel will most likely not change.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

3041,"2011-09-02",4.2,"2010 vintage.  A beer Ive wanted to try for a long time now.  Got a bottle of this a little while back but waited until now to crack it.  The pour is a deep amber-brown color with a tan head that settles as a patchy layer.  The aroma shows a mix of bourbon, plums, dates, toffee, caramel, brown sugar, and after all that a slight whiff of alcohol fumes.  Really nice.  The flavors are smooth and warming going down but perhaps not quite as impressive as the aroma.  Sweet candy-like flavors kick it off of dark fruit, caramel, and brown sugar.  This gets slightly toasty and boozy in the finish with more caramel.  Bourbon and wood is consistent throughout and gives this some nice depth and added flavor.  The carbonation is good.  Never does it seem too sweet.  There are barleywines I like better but if someone said that this was the standard for a barrel-aged barleywine I wouldnt argue much.  Nice depth, properly carbed, and the bourbon is plenty noticeable but not so strong to over power everything else going on.  Nice stuff.

Flavor is fantastic, great depth, plenty of fruity port, rum, sherry, powder sugar, sugar daddy candy, bit of bitterness pairs with the noticeable alcohol towards the finish with just a bit of a burn, if anything has ever come close to the classic English BWs this is it, immensely nutty, almonds and cashews, longer chocolate and woody oak aftertaste.

3041,"2010-12-09",4.4,"Bottle.  2010 version.  Among the very best barleywines that Ive tried.  This is sit-down-and-take-a-moment good, and I can imagine it getting better with age.  The pour is clear ruby with a tiny head.  Its fairly viscous, though not quite as much as you might expect from a 14% abv beer.  All sorts of flavors come out in the aroma and taste.  Theres an enormous English caramel/toffee malt flavor marbled with a ton of fruitiness.  Lots of raisins, plums, peaches, dates and cherries.  On top of that, there are great flavors of vanilla, mint, oak, leather and subtle barrel notes.  Theres just a touch of hop bitterness in the finish to pull it back from cloying territory.  This is a deeply flavored beer that oozes luxury and craftsmanship.  Mouthfeel is full and smooth.  It coats the mouth pleasantly, but Ive had lots of stickier, boozier beers that arent nearly the size of this one.

3041,"2010-12-06",4.1,"Deep dark brown coloured body with a cola coloured glow and a nice sized dense, tan head that fades relatively quickly. Great aroma of pit fruits, malt, nuts, earth and a touch of oak and pine. Full-bodied; Deep pungent alcohol and fruit flavours blend well with the rich maltiness and a bit of hop bitterness at the end. Aftertaste shows a lot of potent alcohol flavours, a ton of pit fruits, some oak and leather notes and a touch of deep spices. Overall, this one is pretty good, a nice bit of ageing, and a great barleywine. My only complaint is that its too big of a bottle - but all of my Midnight Sun beers are 65 cL! I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased from Brown Jug in Anchorage, Alaska on 23-June-2010, sampled at home in Washington on 27-November-2010.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

Pours a dark chestnut brown with a small, tight head. Loads of things going on in the aroma department: bourbon, oak, vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, and bits of dark fruit. Taste is very similar, with the barrel-aging really coming through; love the combo that Midnight Sun has done. Unbelievably lush mouthfeel--super creamy with the perfect tint of alcohol warmth (which was quite necessary waiting out there in line). Great drinkability. One of my all-time favorite barleywines.

3041,"2010-11-26",3.4,"Was far more excited to try this one than I ended up being about having tried it. Its a reddish amber, with a sweet aroma - lots of dark fruit, some caramel, balanced by booze. Little to no hop contingent, but theres something else in here. Took us a good 15 minutes to get it. Take a piece of wonder bread, squish it in a ball, shove your nose into it and take a big whiff. That somewhat off-putting yeasty smell is what we get out of this brew. Same thing in the flavor. Not terrible by any means, but I wasnt a fan.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

A-deep hazy mahogony in color. The head is tan, tight, and creamy with little retention and lace

S-the nose is quite big and has more hops than expected but still favors the malts. Brown sugar, candied fruits, and caramel dominate the aroma. A light hop presence lies in the back with floral hops

T-wow, the taste is huge! Carmelized brown sugar comes in right away. An underlying caramel malt sets in next. Candied fruit and some raisins and plums come in towards the back. The hop presence is faint but floral hops and a touch of bitterness make up the finish

M-this is full bodied and chewy. It is extremely big, one of the biggest barleywines I have ever had. The texture is so syrupy but still smooth on the palate. The carbonation is just right giving it a light bite and crispness at the back.

D-are you kidding me? The only thing keeping this from a five is some warming in the back from all the booze. The balance is there, malts run wild, sweetness is high but it doesnt put you off. Everything you could want, and did I mention this thing is huge!

Aroma is sweet and rich--caramel, marzipan, oak, coca-cola (which Guerde noticed), whiskey (quite a bit), notes of coconut, and hints of port. The taste is sweet up front, but quite boozy, along with nuttiness, strong malt (lightly malted towards the end), whiskey and port again, and strawberry jam. Fairly thick mouthfeel, quite smooth, long, semi-dry finish. Very nice, and changes from glass to glass in the same bottle. I would have preferred more port and less whiskey, but overall a great beer. Thanks again, Andy!","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"
3041,"2009-07-15",4.4,"22oz bottle at our Monday tasting. Pours a burnt brown with a super thick foamy head. Nose is massive brown sugar and bourbon. Huge amounts of sweet malt and figs. Amazing smelling beer. Flavor is very sweet, lots of residual sugar but its quite balanced for a malt forward barley wine. The hops are there enough to keep it from being cloying. Caramel covered raisins dominate the flavor. Finishes is long on bourbon and has a decent amount of burn. The alcohol is not well hidden at all. Bottle was marked as 10% but 14% seems more like it. In this style its fine though. Complex with lots of malt characterisitics battling amongst dark fruits and caramel as well as the bourbon from the barrel. It all comes together in an absolutely stunning example of the style. The english would be proud. It was our favorite of the night.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
3041,"2009-07-09",4.2,"Original review date 5/22/2009...I have sat on this one wayyy too long but its time. I think the Portsmouth snifter is the proper vessel for this deal.

Theres a ginger head thats about 1/2 finger and goes quickly. The body is flat milk chocolate/turbid coffee brown. Color is a little like a cherrywood-ish dunkel.

This is a classic maltbomb barleywine going on. It is pure vanilla sticky sweet with some booziness and some earthy caramel malt - the heavy stuff. Very much a peanut brittle texture. Hop profile is on deep background and I fault nobody for this - its a creamy old-school barleywine. Wicked solid.

I dont really encounter beers made this way anymore and thats my fault, but this one reminds me of a more robust version of backburner, which I enjoy immensely...but this one is without the apple (fault?) texture. Lots of vanilla and oak...maybe some hop pine but the star is some incredible rich, sweet and comforting velvety dark caramel maltiness. The booze on this reminds me of a couple of bourbon barrels - the color morphs into a dark bourbon after a while...it mixes into the whole effort and doesnt offend.

Palate feel matches nose and palate on this one. Its deep, dark and malty but it doesnt overpower. The oak in here actually soothes the booziness nicely and relaxes the palate after a while. It brings a bit of bourbon to the game to make it interesting.

This sips much nicer than your average bear in the weight class. It has bench strength and depth. Enough hops to intrigue. Excellent.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

3041,"2009-05-30",4.2,"Okay, so I was a bit hasty. I was just so eager to finally crack open the bottle of Arctic Devil that I made no note of its production year. Now, this beer was received in a trade waaay back in early 2008 (mid-February, IIRC). So, if we suppose it was, at the time, a current bottle, it was from the November 2007 release, making it a 2007 vintage. Lets roll with that!

2007 Vintage.

Appearance: Pours a delicately hazy, deep, russet-hued body with a thin, wispy, ecru-colored head.

Smell: Strong, sweet-smelling malt aroma with plenty of dark caramel, toasted toffee, and brown sugar. While there is a ripe plum and dried fig fruit character, its simply bursting at the seems with a rich cherry fruitiness. Theres even room enough for vanilla, damp oaken barrels, and some nose-tingling alcoholic wafts.

Taste: Thickly sweet and oh-so delectable dark caramel ice cream topping flavor garnished with a pinch of hearty cinnamon and brown sugar. Plenty of fruitiness, and, as with the nose, its big on the cherries! Drizzle of Grade A maple syrup straight from Vermont. Touches of vanilla and lightly tannic oak wood. An earthy bitterness melds in well with the rest of the brew. Now, mind you, theres an ample amount of alcohol warmth coursing through this brew, but, thanks to the assertive maltiness, it prevents it from coming across as overly hot. Finishes long with plenty of drying alcohol and an enduring maltiness.

Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is both silky and smooth.

Drinkability: Another skillful release from Midnight Sun. Barleywines are addicting enough on their own, but Arctic Devil takes it to a whole new level of hedonistic indulgence. Overall, an exemplary brew!","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
3041,"2009-05-26",4.0,"22oz bottle, thanks Keith!  Pours a really dark, black-looking mahogany with a creamy head.  Really nice retention in this one.  Nose is heavy on the malt with a large dose of dark fruits and brown sugar... very nice.  Explosion of flavors on the palatte, this is one good barleywine.  A little burnt malt, burnt tobacco going on, which lends an elegant air to it.  I dont really like the long, bitter finish brought about by the hops.  A definite bourbon edge to it..was this aged in bourbon barrels?  Its really flavorful, rich, and elegant, but it just has that lingering hop bitterness I dont care for.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

Just looking at this one you know its going to be full of malty goodness. Brown sugar, malt, toffee, raisin and a fair amount of booze in the aroma. Also hints of piney hops. Taste has an abundance of malt, caramel, vanilla, yellow raisins. Little hop presence, but it is faintly there. Solid sticky body. Gets a little warm as it warms, but the flavors also pop as it warms. This is a meal, not sure how much of this I want to drink, but you could polish off the bomber before you realize it.

3041,"2009-02-24",4.4,"2007 bomber, aged over one year.  A small, foamy, camel-hair colored head settles in to a swirly film.  Minimal, random lace spots hover above the dense and cloudy, caramel-brown body.  Rich, malty, and inviting, the nose shows like a virtual dessert liquor of the highest quality.  Velvety caramel and perfectly toasted toffee intertwine with subtle cocoa, while very figs and dates lend fruity depth.  Gobs of vanilla stem from the oak barrel, which shows a sort of sherry-like presence in this beer, quite vinous and fruity.  Flavors again show a decadent caramel-toffee and brown sugar malt base, with hints of cocoa bitterness and silky smooth, oaky vanilla.  Earthen hops lend balance, while fruity sherry and fresh walnuts add complementary depth.  There might be some hints of maple in there as well.  The mouthfeel is big and rich, well carbonated and semi-dry on the finish.  Despite the whopping 14% ABV, it drinks like a dream.  Most barleywines tend to fall towards the malty English style or the American hop-bomb style. This one not only bridges the gap between the two wonderfully, it also brings in some fruity Belgian influence and enhances the triumvirate blend with a near perfect degree of barrel influence.

3041,"2009-01-18",3.8,"2008 release; Sampled January 2009
Served at around 60°F / 15.6°C.  The beer pours into my 25cl tulip glass with a three-finger thick, amber tinged, full tan colored head.  The beer is a dark, concentrated amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, deep cranberry hue when held up to the light.  The aroma first hits with sticky hop aromatics but is soon backed by a solid malt note.  Up front there are notes of grapefruit zest and pine needles, but the sticky, candied malt character seems to slowly win out over the hop character.  Malt aromatics of brown-sugar crusted raisins, toasted-toffee-glazed pastries, perhaps a hint of cherry notes and a light, toasted nut note that because of the sweet malt reminds me of candied nuts.  The hop character is never totally subsumed by the malt, it seems to add a sort of green, sort of herbal vegetation type thing to the nose.

Very sweet and rich feeling, up front there is a solid herbal hop note as well as a reasonable bitterness in the finish, but this beer is really about the malt.  Rich notes of toffee, brown sugar and a touch of cocoa along with a deep, toasted malt note make this quite the chewy beer.  The finish has a bit of warm alcohol to it that along with the sweet malts reminds me a bit of a dark rum; the alcohol warmth is brought out by some spicy oak notes and there also seems to be a touch of vanillin noticeable underneath the sweet malt.  There is a touch of toasted, not quite roasted grain here, it adds a touch of almost bitterness that couples with the astringency from the tannic oak, both of which provide some balance to the dominant sweet malt.

After noticing the oak in the flavor, I can now pick it up in the aroma; it adds a soft spiciness and probably exacerbates the green hop notes a bit as well.  The hop character though seems to completely fade into the background after this has breathed for a bit; much of the sharp, un-integrated character was likely from the barrel, and it still is a bit jarring.  Somehow, despite not being the most well integrated beer, this just oozes potential.  Part of the charm of this beer for me is the fact that I can just see this aging so well.

I am disappointed in myself for not getting two bottles of this.  The hop character in this fresh example are really a distraction, despite how slight they are (though they are magnified a bit by the sharp oak character), I want this beer to be all about the malt and I have the feeling that a bit of age will make this beer fantastic; the hops, and even the oak character should round out considerably and the beer should turn into heaven in a glass.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

I have to say, I tried this again shortly after the first, and didn’t think it was as good, I think age plays a major factor in this beer.  Taste was fruit, wheat, hid the alcohol pretty well.  Overall, a nice round flavor with punch hops and delicious malt.  Good stuff.","Holt, Michigan, USA","masonjer"

Plenty of dark fruits consisting of raisins, prunes and figs up front.  Just behind is brown sugar, chocolate and old oak.  Port, whiskey and buttered vanilla also have a pretty decent showing, with a little alcohol in the background.  Oh man, I did a list of the aromas.  Darn.  Flavor has the brown sugar dominating but the dark fruits are a close second.  I almost got a toffeeish element in there.  No other real surprises compared to the aroma.  Barrel aging with the different barrels never got overpowering and blended very well together with the beer.  Whoo.  This is strong.  Warming all the way down the throat and into the belly.  Dry finish with bitterness peaking around a 3.  Big thick body with low to moderate carbonation.

Toffee-ish, sticky, fruity- plum, dried fig, and a sweet nutty hint from the malt depth. The malt depth of this stuff reminds me of famous vintages such as J.W. Lee’s and Thomas Hardy’s.

Very lovely, soft toffee notes in the aroma. It promises to be a superior English style BW, and that’s indeed what it is. The flavor is complex, a bit nutty, with the main elements being strong caramel but also some port. It’s warming without being boozy, with a mild hint of yeast in the somewhat spicy finish.

3041,"2008-10-26",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2010 [Bottle] Pours a hazy caramel with a small and dissipating beige head. Aroma is boozy with lots of caramel, only a hint of bourbon that Im not sure I would be able to notice if I didnt already know it was there, some vinous character, and not really any evidence of hops. Flavor is sharp and sweet with lots of warming alcohol. The flavor is massive - lots of caramel, figs, raisins, some sherry, slightly harsh tannin, and chocolate. The mid-palate has a strong astringency that carries into the finish, and I think it would definitely benefit from a year of extra aging. The carbonation is light and pleasant and the mouthfeel is moderate to slightly dry. After it warms and Im nearly finished with my half of the bottle, I notice a huge cinnamon and clove presence - very nice.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","MatSciGuy"

Dark caramel-cream head half-fills the glass, smooth but bubbling away quickly atop the darkly translucent molasses body....nose is plummy, rum-soaked cherries, hints of vanilla and old port, faintly alcoholic but quite pleasantly so, lots of caramel....on the tongue, quite sweet but with some woody dryness showing up quickly, lovely thick, rich and malted-milkshake mouthfeel but there is something of a cardboard character to the finish that really hurts....this lessens a bit with warmth, and the end result is a very good, though not quite excellent, sweet and thick and low-on-the-hops barley wine.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

3041,"2008-04-05",4.4,"This is by far and away, pound for pound one of the best barleywines in the world in my opinion.  Just a beast, but balanced.  Rich and smooth, with lots of dates, and brown sugar, and maple nuts.  Sweet without being cloying and so well balanced, you would never know it was such a high gravity beer.  This years will need to lay down for several months, but as in past vintages it ages extremely well, pick this one up after about 6 months in the cellar and enjoy.","Gulf Shores, Alabama, USA","BlackDonald"

Big brown thick pour with thin head and very little lacing.  Molasses smell with figs and light alcohol.  Nice molasses, almost burning sugar/caramel flavor.  A hint of berry scented acetone in the smell as it warms.  Really heavy, but nice.  This is probably the most alcohol present in a beer that I like.  Big, thick palate.  Still a bit too much prune, fig, alcohol flavor for me.  Nice developed and balanced beer but just not the most drinkable or refreshing on a warm day.","Austin, Texas, USA","pintsize"
3041,"2008-03-05",3.8,"$18 for the 08 22-oz bottle. Pours a rich burgandy color with a short lived tan head.  Smell is malty, molassesy, with lots of rich chewy, sweet and sticky dried fruits and nuts, along with a noticeable alcohol presence as well.  
Taste is similarly malty with a dark sweet fruity and nutty flavor.  Somewhat prailine like.  Really nice flavor aside from the somewhat strong alcohol presence which by the 2nd glass definitely detracts from the beer.  Moderate body, to perhaps a bit sticky and syrupy but definitely not overly so.  I really loved the unique nutty fruity malty flavor in this and would like it even more if the alcohol tamed down with age.  Unique and really nice, but hard to justify the price I paid.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

Lots of toffee and sweet caramel with cinnamon and loads of nutmeg. Vanilla cream, mocha, pumpkin spice with raisins and figs as well...wow. Earthy flavors combine grassy hay with more caramel and some milk chocolate with dark fruits. Hints of leather, wood and tobacco ride above the silky smooth malt backbone.

Finally, a brew on my vacation that delivered!!!!  Nose picked up sweet malts, plum, oak, caramel, toffee, warm booze.  It came off a bit flat - which can be expected.  Flavor was (very) sweet plum, boozy oak covered caramel with bourbon, wood, leather.  Finish hung around for days - simply decadent!  Mouthfeel was full bodied, sticky, bite-able . . . a real legit tonsil massage - timeless!!!  This was barrel aged to perfection, it complimented rather than ripped apart the flavor.

Almost looks like a Barbaresco in the glass after a minute or two. The thick khaki head quickly disappears leaving a still looking beer. Deep, thick reddish/brown. Beautiful looking pour. Aroma of brown sugar, wood tannin, dark, candied fruits (raisins and figs), vanilla, some tropical fruit, clove and a touch of alcohol... which does not distract at all. Wonderful balance of sweeter malt and earthier hops and wood. Silky smooth on the tongue. Not a lot of carbonation, but what little is present is quite lively. As on the nose, there is an excellent balance of sweet and earthiness on the palate. Black liquorice stands out. Tart cherry, plenty of wet wood, caramel, toffee, bitter hops and alcohol which adds to the complexity. This is one great beer  that will only get better with time.

miketds generosity appears to have few limits.  Not long after opening one rare beer someone brought out this gem.  Ive yet to try any Midnight Sun beers but should I ever get the chance to visit Alaska I will be stocking up on as much as I can ship home affordably.  If you have any spare bottles I would not object to them showing up on my doorstep (full please :) )
Aroma / Appearance - The sticky lacing clung to the sides of the glass as the rest of it filled with a dark brown body.  The nose was boozy but wheaty and chocolately.  Overall being chewy and thick it felt like the perfect thing for a cold winter day.
Flavor / Palate - Caramel, vanilla and ash made me think this was barrel aged before finding out that was the case.  The throat warms from the alcohol which is not subtle at all.  It even lingers in the finish which is strong enough to overpower most simpler styles.  You might be able to finish a bottle alone but if you have friends invite them over.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3041,"2008-01-04",4.4,"Vintage 2007; this one simply bursts with the potential to age, but it was simply too enticing on this cold night.  Rich, murky mahogany pour.  Varnish with a beige cream.  Aroma eases into the richest of malts with soft creme brulee, moist gingerbread and rum bread pudding, nuanced by a bright cantaloupe and caramelized pear overtone that is at once relaxed and searingly assertive.  Soy sauce with some musty cut grass and graham cracker lend some tangential saltiness and aged sentiment.  Blasts of toffee and dirty barrel.  This is an aroma to contemplate, thoroughly and slowly.  Taste brings a stinging but soft bourbon quality of eggnog and tender vanilla, overlaying a syrup of strawberry, raspberry and watermelon seed; hot, but pleasantly so, with a lot of burnt sugar and raw barrel earthiness.  So big, brash, and uncompromising in its impenetrable, pristine and artful collage of malt; cherry skins, caramel, toffee, dates.  Full bodied, warm, and wet with the intimations of brandy and port barrels in the mouth, giving an understated and well placed scrape of soft carbonation on the back of the throat at the end; finishes warmly with a peppery, curtailed touch of alcohol in sherry form.  An extraordinary, pleasingly malt dominant, careful, and quintessential example of this so often overkilled style.  Glory.  Thanks Tim!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Buttery full burnt caramel blending in the mouth with a thick bar of melted semi-sweet chocolate.  Velvety in texture.  Flavors linger long into the finish without adding much else, except maybe a little butterscotch.

I get creamy caramel candy and some nutty roasty malts. Then the big dark fruitiness comes in and rides into the finish along with a warming alcohol sensation. Leaves a sweet lip smacking feeling behind.


Sampled at the O-Town throwdown. This beer has a nearly opaque copper color with thin tan head. The aroma is pretty big with lots of dark fruitiness and with hints of caramel and sweet malts. There also seems to be some whisky and alcohol in the background. The flavor is delicious barleywine dark and shriveled fruit flavors with a whisky and sweet caramel under currents.

Good, moderate carbonation and a dry, crisp, alcoholic slick, velvety sipping medium-full bodied mouthfeel.

Tastes of grain breads, toffee and caramel malts that combines with the molasses flavor, fruity, plums, figs and sour berries, woody alcohol that is very warming in the back of palate, earthy, pine herbal leafy hops emerge in the end, a soft, smooth bitterness, and a dry yeasty, malty finish.

3041,"2007-01-31",4.2,"22oz. bottle, Nov. 2005 bottling date.  10% abv.  Powerfully enticing and intriguing aroma, plenty of dark caramel and candyish, sugary sweetness blended with a touch of oak, nascent medicinal alcohol, faint whiskey, vanilla, nutty malts and hints of red grape, dried apricot, cellar must and coconut further in the background.  Deep, dark garnet color, the head settling to a very slight tan ring around the rim of the glass.  Flavor profile is full, complex and predominanty malty, with suggestions in varying degrees throughout of sugary, sweet, dark and toasty maltiness, spicy hop bitterness, woody bourbon, peppery alcohol and a rich fruitiness that contributes an undercurrent of raisin, date and black cherry.  Palate is warming, smooth and expansive with suitably minimal carbonation felt and a massive body to support the myriad of flavors.  An impressive beer and at seemingly just the right age.  Perfect choice for a cold winters night.  This one had also been on my wishlist for quite some time.  Cheers, herb!","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

Great classic barley wine aroma of sweet dark fruits, malt, vanilla, and alcohol. Nice medium mouthfeel but smooth and soft on the palate. Less hoppy than your typical american barleywine. Flavor of sweet candy caramel, vanilla, and cinnamon. The oak is very faint, and is merely an accent. Perfect amount of bitterness on the finish. You would never guess that this is 14%. Complex without confusing the palate. This is an outstanding Barleywine that is going to stay on my wants list. Anyone please, send more.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"

Smell is sweet, spicy, full of what smells like maple syrup.  Taste is smooth and contains no alcohol presence at all.  Very sweet tasting, notes of maple and cinnamon come through as it warms up a tad.  Simply put, a down right amazing barley wine.  This ranks among the best for me.  Awesome stuff, its just a shame that it is quite difficult to get.  Damn, I will be sad when this bottle is done.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"

Fantastic aromas of rich baked apples dusted with a touch of cinnimon spice.  Additional treats of caramel, vanilla, and a touch of bourbony oak.  Wonderful olfactory treat.  Full, yet silky body thats dangerously easy to drink.  Luscious flavors of baked apple crisp and caramelized oaky malts soothe the tongue.  Clean finish that highlights the malt profile continuously on the tongue without revealing any of its alcohol bite.  Dangerously smooth.  Excellent example of a British style barley wine.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

The aroma was malty vinous and caramel malt. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish vinous aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of hops vinous dark malt and brown malt.

Low on the bittering for the style, which was fine for me.  Sweet enough that it was nearly sugary or cloying.  I suppose a bit unbalanced tchnically, but delicious none the less.

3041,"2006-03-23",3.2,"Flat looking deep copper body wears a fading off-white head. Very sweet nose comprises gentle orange and lime notes whereas the rich malts are thick with prunes and smoked maple notes. Potentially nugget/chinook hops procure more woodsy vegetal/herbal tones that I dont care much for. Appears rather simple initially, but MS malts become as potent as they need to be as it warms. Some alcohol eventually peaks through the nose, but the 11.5% really hits the spot in mouth where an immediate burn is felt in a woody way. Besides, strong molasses, maple, berries, grapes and roasted chocolate flavours speak of the intensity MS tries to showcase. Medium-full bodied, moderate carbonation, syrupy and hot barleywine, well executed in that regard.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

3041,"2006-03-20",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2006 Any first impressions?
-There is scant head around the muddled, orangey burgundy.
-A portentous wooden barrel character is a little heavy on the nose, seeing eye to eye with the caramel malts and port wine fruitiness.
-Hot alcohol laces the berries, toffee, maple, and hazelnuts.
-The low carbonation admires the lengthy barrel-aging, and brings out the fruitiness quite well.

What if you dig deeper?
-There is earthiness within the chocolate sweetness.
-This feels a little too young, and not completely cohesive, even though the bottles have been over a year old, and nearly 2 years old.
-The back bitterness seems to come mostly from the alcohol, but a few wooden hops as well.
-Ripe banana purée peeks through the aroma once in a while.
-A very good sipper of a barley wine, but I would prefer it with either a lighter touch of barrel aging, or less alcohol presence.

Hints of maple syrup, caramel, vanilla, coconut, cognac, chocolate honey, molasses and other stuff are in the nose.  Taste is remarkable because of the smoothness.

3041,"2006-01-22",4.2,"2005 bottle shared by OldGrowth on 1/22/06.What a nose!!!  Its like a fresh revival of Harveys Elizabethan or Bluegrass Old Pats Barleywine.  Just immense amounts of rich English toffee delicately and perfectly placed next to a dry prune and raisin note.  Light yeastiness, thick caramel backbone and hints of chocolate and port wine.  Oak aging, truly gracefully done, adds light whiskey, almost peat-like notes.  Intense, strong, lasting and supremely sniffable.  Hardly any hops but with this elegant oak aging, adding just a hint of sharpness (as OldGrowth says), you dont need em!  The flavor is thick, rich and malty, full of caramel and toffee, with more bittering hops than flavoring hops.  Sticky, lightly floral (mostly floral actually) with hints of oak and dry woodiness.  Chewy to the extreme, with some acidity and light vanilla.  Carbonation is low and very tight, alcohol is warming, at this level its inevitable, but nothing past that.  Very full bodied.  Looks the part  Spotty lacing, near opaque, low filtration, bottle conditioned, large head, slow to recede.  Auburn notes throughout a mahogany chestnut body.

I dont know if this was aged in bourbon barrels or not, but the bourbon-like flavor starts to get much stronger as the beer warms. Very little carbonation makes it turn a bit cloying after a while.

Vanillin, bready malts, and oak whispers. Gently carbonated and lushly soft. Frontal display of succulent hops succumb to a dryly oaky, tannic assault. The body remains chewy, however, with beefy malt flavors deflecting the full-on dryness. Sneaky hop-bitterness exaggerates the salty tannins and oak-laden dryness, while earthy-tinged tropical-fruit hop flavors lend more juiciness. Spicy accent of anise from the alcohol. Thickset blend of vanillin and cakey malts mask the sharp flash of alcohol and medicine. Finishes sweetly malty, flush with toffee drizzled fruitcake over a supple grapefruit bedding. Lasting hop bitterness and pungent oak continue to thwart the sappy sweetness long after the swallow. Flawlessly conditioned, refined oak profile, and skillfully extracted malt flavors. A mesmerizing dessert concoction thatll only gain more decadence with age.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3041,"2005-05-12",3.7,"Bottle from Styles.  Deep chestnut colored, not much head.  Very malty aroma, with a fair hop balance.  A touch of alcohol sneaks in the aroma.  Medium bodied.  Alcohol is fairly up front.  A bit of leather and dark pit fruit in the nose.  Malty and fairly well balanced with hops in flavor.  Still a bit harsh and boozy.  Age may serve this well.","Alabama, USA","11026"
3041,"2005-05-11",3.6,"Bottle:  Courtesy of Styles.  Vinuous, woody, whiskey and light alcohol in the aroma.  Pours a deep hazy deep red.  Malty, vinuous, and whiskey with a raisin and alcohol finish.  Syruppy mouthfeel.  Somewhat sweet overall.  Alcohol presence increases in the flavor the more it warms.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3041,"2005-05-01",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2006 Pours deep dark ruby reddish brown with very little head.   Aroma is very sweet...lotsa brown sugar, toffee,  molasses, caramel, raisins, some notes of oak, alcohol, etc.  Taste is big on maltiness, brown sugar, caramel, molasses, dark fruits, raisins, hints of toffee, and mabye, just maybe some light hop  bitterness.  Full-bodied and smooth with a big alcohol kick....sticky and syrupy sweetness on the palate.  Does get syrupy in parts.  The finish doesnt distinguish itself....somewhat bitter in the end, but youve got to search for it.  Tasty.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"
3041,"2005-04-20",3.8,"Bomber served in a Duval Snifter: Very deep brown with crimson highlights, little head or lace, oily cling on glassware. The aroma has a extreme note of molasses, dates, and overripened apple up front. Additionally I detect basic carmel malts, earthy yeast esters, sea salt and a hint of oak. The taste starts malty sweet with a moderate fruit component and bourbon barrel notes. The finish is lightly spiced, a bit salty and some alcohol overtones, but not too overpowering. I feel is oily and yer crisp, moderate alcohol burn. Taste young yet I dont think it would age too much has the malt sweetness is already quite powerful and it needs all the bitterness left in the bottle. A good offering from the land of the midnight sun.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
3041,"2005-04-15",4.1,"Bottled date of November 04. Poured a dark and cloudy brown color with a small off white head. Aromas of vanilla, dark fruits and wood. Tastes of vanilla, dark fruits, brown sugar, and molasses. Sweet. Light alcohol in the finish. Overall a very tasty Barley Wine.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
3041,"2005-04-15",4.3,"Poured a murky brown color with a thin, quickly diminishing light tan head that left very light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of caramel, vanilla, dark fruits, and citrus hoppiness.  Very complex taste of vanilla,  toffee, dried fruits, light roast, caramel malts, melons, apples, light hop bitterness, and a touch of alcohol.  Thanks for sharing hopdog, I really liked this one!","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"

2002 vintage
Draft version: This one was a personal highlight of the festival, as well the overall winner of the Hard Liver fest.  Bursting alive with rich cherries, plums, nuts, and bubblegum hoppy sugary scents, the nose on this beer is magical.  I think this is only time Ive ever liked nuts and gum togethor.  Overly sweet at times, and definitly full of hops with some sweet oak flavors, vinuous grape notes, stinging high alcohol, and a body which coats the mouth and warms you throughout.  Prickly tree bark flavors, brown sugar and caramelized cherries.  Really amazing... with such a big, robust nose full of barkdust and dark fruit, this one is very deserving of the festival win.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3041,"2005-03-31",4.1,"Bottle pours dark brown, burnt caramel hues, small sandy colored fizzy head, with very spotty lacing.   Seems quite aged by its somewhat stillness.   Fantastic aroma of dark pitted fruit and loads of brown sugar/carmelized sugar.   Smells fantastic, albeit fairly sweet.   Little whafts of alcohol are also present.   Smoothness on first sip, lots of brown sugar and fig/date/raisin as well.   Very minor alcohol, otherwise its hidden quite well.   Slight warming in the throat/chest however.   Body and mouthfeel are bordering on full, but seem rather mediocre given the heartiness of this brew.   Big, HUGE, malty finish, sweet, with loads of brown sugar and dark pitted fruit.   Almost a bit too sweet tho... slightly cloying.   Otherwise, a fine aged Barley Wine.   Big shout out to TChrome for sending this beer as a freakn freebie!!!!   I owe you Tad!!!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"

3041,"2005-03-27",4.1,"Easter Sunday tasting w/ Ernest, Aubrey and Brian.  Dark ruby.  Wonderfully extracted caramel and chocolate malts in the nose, along with the barrel contribution which brings slight aromatics of cocunut, bourbon and wood.  Fairly simple aroma but the flavor makes up for it.  Chocolate covered raisin flavor with hints of caramel and oak and a touch of hops of the back of tonque.  Full, coating flavor.  A very good beer.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
3041,"2005-03-27",3.3,"Head is initially small, frothy, off-white, fully diminishing. Body is hazy dark amber. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted bread, caramel), lightly hoppy (resin), with notes of cask wood, sherry, and whisky/alcohol. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Fairly nice in the mouth experience for the style, but the aroma is somewhat simple and uninteresting.  Pretty good, but isnt standing out in any way.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3041,"2005-03-27",4.1,"Big molassis and alcohol/barrel aroma. Dark reddish brown, thin head with good lacing. Great soft mouthfeel, velvety and oily. Huge alcohol up through the nose.

3041,"2005-03-27",4.1,"Dark brown. Creamy, very rich and weighty mouthfeel. Big notes of brown sugar exude throughout. Other notes of tobacco, caramel, freshly toasted bread, wood and nuts. Warm, hidden alcohol. Grassy, piney hops balance things out wonderfully. Delicious barleywine.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
3041,"2005-03-26",4.2,"2004 Bottle @ 55 degrees to start:  Pours orange-dark brown with a mostly dissipating beige colored head.  Aroma does indeed hold to the English side of the house with big sweet malty aromas, alcohol, and some oak, prunes/raisins.  Flavor is very refined and is lowly carbonated though this is not a detriment with this beer.  Many layers of flavor here, initial flavor is malt sweetness, some sherry notes, lots of wood.  Very rich and refined; no rough edges.  Alcohol is also markedly hidden for an 11.5% barleywine.  This excellent beer has many things going for it.","Bedford, Texas, USA","TChrome"
3041,"2005-03-25",4.1,"Very nice mahogany color with a tiny tan head. Very strong aroma of pine and maple. Strong maple, pine, molasses, toffee, vanilla and alcohol flavors. Initially, it tasted a bit like chewing on a maple tree. As it warmed, it really grew on me.","Fresno, California, USA","flutetokill"
3041,"2005-03-25",4.1,"Deep, dark cherry brown color with a very small beige head. The aroma burst out with intense maple (maybe molasses) and pine. The flavor was an interesting mix of pine, earthy/soil, molasses, toffee, maple, alcohol, honey, and prunes. The feel was rather smooth...very soft carbonation, thick/coating on the tongue...wet finish. This is one hell of a challenging beer...this is definitely not for the novice beer drinker.","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"

3041,"2005-03-25",4.1,"10% abv, according to the label.
the words ""survive"" and ""subzero"" hover in the corners of the label art, while what seems like a crazed wolverine snarls at the viewer front and center. Im keeping safe distance...but plan to get comfy with this bottle, off goes the cap, and away we go...
dark russet color, with deep ruby at the corners, sizeable, light tan head. 
Gorgeous nose at first sniff, bright cherries, big, cognac-y alcoholic feel, rosey, port-wine feel...slick, thick, viscous, ..leather and molasses, on a bed of berries and grapes.
Big, bold, imperial flavor, massive mouthfeel, sticky and lip-smacking. Same flavors in the aroma rebound in the taste, but dont hang as hard, sort of dwindles...nicely rounded, very harmonic...I cant keep quacking about barleywines not being as big as they ought to be, when, in this case, it contains itself very nicely, has an abundance of character, yet isnt too loud or hot. Mellow for a barleywine, but very classy.
Pity I didnt had this around when it was colder...I have to drink this damned thing in the dawning of spring...but it does the job!
Nice one, Midnight Sun!...further into the bottle, prunes are the predominant flavor...not tasted earlier...","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

Smells a alot like Thomas Hardy, to me. Taste is woody and sweet with alcohol notes throughout. Brown sugar, caramel, molasses, ripened dark fruits, raisins, hints of toffee, and light bitterness. Body is velvety smooth with alcohol warmth throughout and sticky sweetness. Does get syrupy in parts. Finish is more wood and raisins with alcohol, an increased hop bitterness, cinnamon, cocoa, and toffee. Very sweet at times. Nice beer though!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"

3041,"2005-03-01",4.3,"2/19/05.  On tap at Toronado Barleywine Festival 04 in San Francisco, CA 2/19/05.  One of the best beers of the festival-- dark and delicious.  Deep red-brown with a light tan, thin head and blotchy lacing.  Long-lasting ring with very good (if still blotchy) lacing and reverse lacing, hanging in there much longer than it would initially appear.  Big sweet spiced aroma with light leathery malt.  Complex with some dark nougat character to the sweetness.  Finish is killer.  Very long and clean with terrific control.  Very delicious.  Smooth and soft body with a light prickle bite on the finish.  Perfect with the lingering malt and spice.  A deservedly highly-praised beer at the festival.  I wouldnt be surprised if this had ended up the audience favorite, if there were a vote to pick one.  Id love to see how it translates to the bottle, and especially to see how it holds up over time.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
3041,"2005-03-01",3.8,"vintage 11/2004 22 oz bottle Dark muddy brown/amber with a very small ring of a head. Pours very syrupy. Sweet aroma, alcohol, caramel, molasses, and light wood. Hugely sweet but somehow not overpowering at all. A bit of woodiness comes out more in the flavor. Quite fruity and bitter late. The alcohol is noticeable but pleasing. Body is massive and syrupy. A teeth-coater for sure. A real winter warmer this is. And I love the label artwork.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
3041,"2005-02-20",4.3,"2004 bottled version. Deep red gold color. Large sized beige foamy head. Aroma is brown sugar, molasses and more brown sugar. A full-bodied barley wine. Malts are fruity  (cherries and plums) and sweet. Lots of molasses and brown sugar flavors. VERY sweet, yet its not at all cloying. Talk about your liquid candy, this beer is it. Smooth taste, hides the 10% alcohol very well. Reminds me a little of La Maitresse du Moine. A nice big malty barley wine. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

3041,"2005-02-10",4.3,"Looks like Im the first to review the 2004 bottled version, maybe the ten buck price tag has something to do with that! At any rate: Dark auburn/chestnut, very slight spritzy carbonation; deep aromas of plum and cherry with hints of roses and graham crackers. round and full on the palate, very nice integration of the whiskey barrels it was aged in with a nice understated (yet HUGE) English style barleywine, numbs the gums slightly from the alcohol but its clean and has a nice gingery tang on the finish...very impressive!","Portland, Oregon, USA","Perkeo"
