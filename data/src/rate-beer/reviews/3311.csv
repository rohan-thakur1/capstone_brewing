3311,"2017-06-19",3.6,"Can - pours gold white head - nose and taste of bready malt, light fruity notes and dried orange peel - medium body",", New Jersey, USA","jtclockwork"
3311,"2017-06-15",3.8,"From the 16 fl. oz. can stamped 339-022217 on the bottom. Hazy looking light amber pour under a modest silky white head that lingers. Lovely aroma of toasted bread, crackers, Euro-malts, toffee, and sweetness. Lower hop profile. This has a nice smooth and medium body, The taste begins bready and sweet and there is a nice dry bitterness that kicks in at the finish. Lingers some. Delightful beer.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
3311,"2017-06-14",3.7,"12 oz. draft at STREET, Portsmouth NH. Almost clear amber golden color. Aroma shows me sweet grains, mild yeast, and just the faintest notes of pepper when warm. The flavor reveals to me a Vienna / rye not I didnt smell. Body is medium and shows a low level of chewy texture.  Hops are not forward here and give a more traditional German feel than I was initially expecting. The spicy grains banish in the finish and it ends super clean. Pretty damn easy drinking.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3311,"2017-06-08",3.9,"On tap at the brewery. Cloudy amber gold pour with lacy white head. Aroma is nutty, grainy, fruity, light doughy notes. Taste is mild, grainy, light citrusy fruit, fresh and doughy. Palate is med bodied, creamy, med carbonation. A bit heavier than expected but a very very pleasant malty lager.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
3311,"2017-05-30",3.5,"Had in a 16 oz can alongside some dank ass wings. Pours a typical yellowy lagery thing with a thin grassy lagery smell. The taste is smooth and easy drinking, some malt, very light hops, and a robust aftertaste of vague dried fruit. All in all, not bad, better than Jacks Abby House Lager by a tad, but in the same wheelhouse. Another solid entry from JA. Good for pounding down dank wings (duh) and missing your boo boo who couldnt make it out cause she had to meet with her advisor.","New Haven, Connecticut, USA","meccahh69lol"
3311,"2017-05-27",3.1,"Pretty refreshing after a day outside. Malty, crisp, yet some body and thickness to this. Nice.","Rochester, New York, USA","jb"
3311,"2017-05-04",3.6,".5L can. Dated 03.27.17, so just about a little more than a month old. Pours a gold amber color. Just a light haze. Aroma is lightly Ryebread, a little dry biscuit with faint malt sweetness. Flavor has a little mineral to it with similar Bready character with a light noble hop touch. And with very very mild bitterness. A moderately full body with light softness yet sprinkling carbonation on the cheeks","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

3311,"2017-03-24",4.2,"On tap on premise. Clear bright golden with a medium white head, decent retention, leaving good lacing. Aroma is super bready with herbal hops, noble hops and floral presence. Taste is also bread malts forward with herbal notes, cushy cereals, light fruitiness, very mild spiciness and floral notes. Light body. Moderate carbonation. Fluffy mouthfeel. Clean and crisp. Herbal finish. Incredibly drinkable with a nice malt depth. I could see myself drink a lot of these on hot summer days. Never bland. Lovely.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Palate follows with a creamy mouthfeel, lots of chewy grain balanced by some soft well placed sweetness, toasted bitterness and lingering spice.

3311,"2017-02-17",3.5,"Almost a lemon citrus hop aroma with a lagerish funk. Taste is a light lager funk with a lemon citrus hop. Crisp and not too lager funk. Generally not a big fan of the style but this is well done and refreshing and flavorful.

3311,"2016-05-12",4.1,"Draught at the brewery, 4/23/16.Very mildly hazy peachy-gold body is topped by a small white head showing strong retention.Soft, herbal hops in the nose are immediately delightful. Even low on the pepperiness, with just full-on rosemary-thyme (fresh, wet, green herbal notes. Not the more bitter/spicy character of dried herbs). Honey and honeysuckle even, with just a hint of sourdough and tons of fresh baguette. Fresh yeast and tons of very mild, easygoing honeysuckle lingering with no alcohol or flaw.Intensely soft, malty texture immediately entices, with herbal hop qualities and very light dough and honey suggestions. Moderate carbonation is engaging while more white bread notes build up. The palate is cleared by a crisp, peppery and herbal hop bitterness on the finish as light honeysuckle/honey dots the palate. Really nice stuff. I dont purport to know much about kellerbier and zwickels, but I think this is a very, very well-done example. Flavorful and well-hopped with the right kind of hops but yet extremely drinkable, mild and clean.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
