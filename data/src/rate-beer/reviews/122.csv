Son goût de pomme caramélisée assaisonné de quelques gouttes de sirop dérable est bien ajusté par une acidité qui ne fait que le nécessaire. Son corps liquoreux et gras tapisse ma langue dune assez belle façon. Sa finale complètement balancée est charmante. Délicieux cidre de glace.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

Smell is intense with musty sour apples, fleshy sweet apples, star fruit, hay, dry soil, lemon peal, alcohol and hints of paper. Taste is sweet, sour and fruity. Mouthfeel is oily, round, tiny sticky sweet, heavy tart, tiny boozy and medium to full bodied.

122,"2015-09-06",4.2,"How: Sample (1½ oz) at Northern Kingdom Tasting Center. 

>>> A wonderfully delicate and complex ice cider with a really unique profile. Its not an ""in your face"" ice cider and the acidity level is rather low so it let you appreciate an impressive range of flavors coming from 30 varieties of apples. 

-  Clear bright golden-straw color leaving nice legs on the glass. 
-  You have to take a bit more time than with your usual ice cider to really appreciate the aroma of this one as theres not one massive flavor jumping in your face, but a wide range of delicate flavors coming from the 30 varieties of apples. 
-  Its even more impressive with the taste where each small sip if different from the previous one. More than in any other ice cider I have tried so far, this one really change as it warms and as it gets more contact with air. 
-  Acidity level is rather low for an ice cider, but if fits really well with the delicate and complex mix of so many apples varieties. Too much acidity would have hidden everything. 
-  Medium to full body, but it never feel heavy. Oily mouthfeel. Sweetness is mouth coating, not because its very sweet but because theres not as much acidity as usual to cut the sweetness. 

Flavors:  Apple skin, caramelized apples, berries, hints of honey, mild spiciness, lychee, melon.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

122,"2015-05-27",4.5,"Bottle...  This cider rocks!... Pours clear and brilliantly amber with golden highlights and slowly dripping legwork. The aroma is a medley of fresh, crisp apples, pears, citrus blossoms and pluots - so fruity and floral, almost perfumey. Acute sweetness and sharp tartness perform a fantastic balancing act, leading to a smooth, syrupy - yet very drinkable - complexity. Lengthy SweeTart finish. Simply delicious and world class!

122,"2012-09-26",3.9,"375ml bottle purchased at Eden in west charleston, Vt... Pours an incredibly clear medium honey yellow hue with heavy lacing and legs running up and down the sides of the glass... Scents of concentrated honeycrisp apples, red delicious. Too difficult to discern with as many as 30 varietals that go into the ice cider. Sweet and dessert-like but smooth... Flavors are a continuation of the same with a clean concentrated apple focus. Sweet, yes, but the finish adds a mild semi-tart acidity that cuts down on the residual sugars. A touch if soft spice and booze on the backend.  Body is thicker but too the point of being too syrupy. Solid ice cider from the first of its kind in Vermont.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
122,"2011-11-07",3.9,"Bottle poured at CiderDays 2011 - Ice Cider Tasting. Big clear, fresh clean fruit aroma. Clear, plain and golden. The textures are bright, tart, and clean. Not a lot of complexity, but a very clear and forward fresh apple flavor makes up for that. Like a fresh Mac. Good acid and sugar balance. Focused on fresh apple flavor, which is enjoyable.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
