Wheat beers arent really my favourites, but considering I just wrote a bunch of yell-y responses to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency questionnaire about their decision to remove wheat as a permissible primary source of carbohydrates for beer, I suppose Id better give this one a decent chance. The aromas not bad, though theres a bit of the kitchen sink going on there - what, you couldnt find any smoked malt to whack into the mix? - but the flavours a bigger problem. Or, I should say, the sudden death of the flavour. It kind of goes all watery in the middle, and drops dead with just a faint bitter finish.

797,"2014-08-13",3.3,"500ml Bottle from Habana restaurant, Friedrichshain, Berlin (3.50):
Wheat & clove initially, some citrus & bubblegum after that with some lighter malts & yeast too; not a bad start with some fruits lingering in the background as well.

Medium brown, slightly cloudy with a foamy white 1cm head thats smaller than expected but holds very well.

Wheat & light malts with faint caramel & cloves. Spice & touches of water come through around the middle. There was some banana in there as well but this was slightly weaker than I would have liked.

Smooth & easy going with some sweetness but I was disappointed to discover that it was slightly watery in places making it seem a touch bland. Some spice & decent carbonation offset this for the most part but not completely.

A pleasant beer & one that was easy to enjoy without really exciting. Not bad & quite refreshing but the hefeweizen version of this one is better.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

Comments: This one has the right looks and very drinkable, especially without the odd phenol element as in Maisels hefeweiss. Compare to other dunkelweiss Ive had, however, this one seems to miss the essential roast malts aroma and taste - theres no roastiness in smell, nor any chocolaty notes in the taste. If this is a hefeweiss Ill give it a score comparable to Paulaners, but its a dunkelweiss, and it fails to deliver so its rated as such. Another middle of the road pack.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

797,"2007-06-02",4.1,"Another gem from Maisel, onto the beer!!!Out the bottle into a Maisels Weissbier glass cold but not chilled. Pours an unmistakable brown and hazy going on opaque. The carbonation is tight and very fine. The head started at two inches and receded back to an admirable inch of rocky, dense, beigish foam that retains there well and daubs the glass with vigour. Smoked wood, mocha, salted fish? and pretzels hit the nose well pronounced. A little burnt sugar and caramel, dark toffee even soon joins in on the well-defined, but not too striking aroma. Woody, smoky, ashy, large and avin it is the palate. Much action here. Clean phenols take hold, very smoky, ash ridden, forest-floor after a fire,  with so much crushed, whole cloves dancing around proud. This is heavily malty, a hint of rust, some bitter coffee beans, a light astringency evident. Speaking of light the body is and this quite simply glides across the palate. Finish is all that happened prior and the length is long; so much smoke a fire is burning, phenols again and roasted wheat malt joins in well. It does fill the mouth, its presence is set in stone and unique amongst Dunkelweiss biers. Forget wheat beer esters, who needs that when this shows up and livens the party.So many forests were burned and felled to produce this. This cleans and refreshes, and just goes down like Maisel beers should. F&*kin lovely!!!","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

797,"2004-09-21",3.5,"Small, quickly diminishing head. Beautiful cloudy red-brown colour. Some coffee in the nose. Caramel in the taste, a little yeast, some coffee. Some sweetness. It´s good. At first I was a bit disappointed with the taste and it seemed bland. But the more I concentrated on its taste, the more I liked it.","Herdecke, GERMANY","dortmunder"
797,"2004-09-16",3.2,"This weisse is really dunkel, dark brown, in fact. Banana aroma with just a hint of caramel. Sugary flavor with banana and  hints of caramel. Sweet, but still this mbeer manages to stay refreshing. Everymans friend that still has quality.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"

797,"2004-07-27",3.5,"Fairly full, even pungent nose - yeast and dough. Cloudy brown colr and a fizzy tan head. Wheat body followed by a slight chocolate and toasted finish. Thinner than I wanted but a full taste. Clean palate.","GERMANY","pivo"
797,"2004-07-15",2.5,"A dark brown beer with a fine light brown head. The aroma is sharp acidic and the flavor is sweet, slightly roasted and with notes of caramel as well as wheat, but the body is thin.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
797,"2004-02-24",3.9,"This is beautifully presented in the long weizen glass that shows off its rich cumulo nimbus like head. Atop the deep amber this bodes well. There is a good hit of spicy wheat character in the nose with a low hop presence. The taste has a fair degree of phenols but these are appropriate for the style, which is redolent of apple, banana and peach. The aftertaste is very refreshing and as a style this beer is perfectly suited to the clammy Kuala Lumpur weather. An excellent summer beer.","Potts Point, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA","Sully"

797,"2002-12-31",4.4,"this is a dark wheat well out of order, as it is *not* sweet. big contrast to the malty chocolate tast e.g. of Erdinger dark wheat. Quite unique in my experience.
The sweet-malty tongues certainly will not like it.","GERMANY","M.Aisel99"
