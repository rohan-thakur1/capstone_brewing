2985,"2011-06-17",2.2,"Smells and looks okay, which scores it higher than most malt liqours. First sip is extremely strong alcoholic and malt liqourish. It gets a bit better, but really isnt nearly as great as its rated to me.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
2985,"2011-01-08",2.8,"(Growler)Nice body with a corn finish in the flavor.Yellow in color with a white head.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Odeed"
2985,"2010-05-24",2.9,"A malt liquor! Maybe my first craft malt liquor. Pours a clear yellow with a small white head. The aroma is sweet hops, dirty malts. The flavor is a bit hot, aggressive, more hoppy than any other malt liquor ever. Not bad.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
2985,"2009-06-20",2.9,"Sampler at the brewery.

The best malt liquor Ive ever had, fruitier and quite a bit hoppier than I expected, quite smooth, no sign of alcohol.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2985,"2008-11-21",3.5,"Sweet aroma with some grain, corn, and a touch fruity. I thought it was almost juicy. Golden pour with a decent lasting head. Sweet and grainy with hints of corn and a decent bitter finish. I love malt liquor so this one works for me.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
2985,"2008-09-22",2.7,"Draught @ WABF 2008. Poursa clear golden color with a small white head. Sweet malty grainy aroma with some hints of corn. Sweet malty caramel and grainy flavor. Sweet warming caramel finish with some hints of corn.","Malmö, SWEDEN","anders37"
2985,"2008-07-03",3.1,"Clear dark gold with a frothy white head. Big fruity, corn syrup berry aroma with ethyl alcohol. Nice smooth body.  Good sweet pale malt lager flavors with a clean finish. Maybe they should bottle this, in 40 oz’ers and sell’m to the pan handlers on the ave........","Same Trailer, Different Park, Louisiana, USA","AmEricanbrew"
2985,"2008-06-15",2.9,"On tap at WABL Fathers Day BrewFest 2008. Pours clear gold with a thin white head. Medium body & light carbonation. Sweet aroma and taste of biscuit and almonds, maybe a touch of plastic? Not an everyday drink, but ya gotta do at least one.","Kirkland, Washington, USA","bitbucket"
2985,"2008-06-14",2.8,"I had postponed tasting this one as I am not really interested in malt liquors at this point in my life and Big Time always has at least a few decent beers on tap. However, this was a surprising deviation for the style, and had I not known, I would never have pegged this as a malt liquor. It is blonde-bronze in appearance with a foamy-creamy head. Surprising burst of moderately appealing floral and perfumed notes in the aroma mingling with light graininess and alcohol. The flavor reinforces the perfumed-floweriness, with a strong hoppiness. This was akin to a highly hopped cream ale, as it has a smooth, creamy texture.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
2985,"2008-05-25",1.9,"Sample at the pub. Yellow. Holds it head well. Grainy nose. Thick diesel and paint thinner. Almost drinkable.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
2985,"2007-07-15",2.7,"Draft at the brewpub. Pours medium straw color with a thin white head. Light corn nose. Medium body, tingly light corn/hay sweetness on the mid-palate. No particular finish. Pretty drinkable for the style but other than that pretty drab.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2985,"2007-06-21",3.4,"Not bad for a malt liq.  Hot day in Seattle very drinkable, but I have had better premium malt liq.","Kennewick, Washington, USA","PSmith"
2985,"2007-06-09",2.6,"On tap at brewpub a few weeks ago. Light golden. This is what you would expect it to be....pretty sweet, a good kick. One was enough.","Seattle, Washington, USA","glkaiser"
