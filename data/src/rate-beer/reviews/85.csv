85,"2015-12-06",3.8,"750 ml bottle - 5.99 at Chicago-Lake in Minneapolis bottled 9/2015, this could probably rest for a year or so. Pour a gorgeous transparent mahogany with beige white head with good retention. A very attractive beer. Nose is very full - rich deeply caramelized grain notes, raisin, nuttiness and a touch of blended scotch smoothed out by a background of oak. A thick creamy palate and flavors not only match the big aroma but actually double down - along with the residual sugars of the deep and nutty caramelized grain, the flavor actually has a level of umami along with a well-integrated and pleasantly warming note of alcohol. Finishes just a bit rough with some of the big and mildy bitter flavors of alcohol lingering too long on the tongue. The biggest pumpkin beer Ive tried - Id probably style it as a pumpkin barley wine if such a thing existed. As such, it is a refreshingly unique American creation.","San Francisco, California, USA","asedzie"

Feel - It sits much better than fresh pumpkin beers Ive had. Smooth and creamy. Carbonation doesnt really translate to the feel.

This was poured into a snifter.
The appearance was a semi-dark to bronzed dark brown color with a one finger white to off white foamy head that dissipated practically immediately. Lacing was mostly messy, and kinda stringing itself all over the place.
The smell started off with boozy sweet sticky pumpkin spices, ginger, slight allspice, and slight cinnamon. Light breadiness warms into balance it out, damn, and wow!
The taste was boozy sweet with subtle balancing sweet pumpkin spices really nicely. There was a subtle sweet boozy aftertaste running into a sweet sticky finish.

At first drink their is a pumpkin sensibility but the hops are overwhelming. The booziness is subtle until the wash down. A really good beer but I think I like the idea than in its execution.

Taste of amped up pumpkin pie, spice cake (with cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg), alcohol, toffee and oak.

A strong entry in the Halloween seasonal department leaves a big mark. This might be the nicest Crooked Line beer I have tried although I have a few more on deck. A heady release is best split with friends or consumed over a long evening thanks to a high gravity.

Aroma / Appearance - The warm hue has the color of melted caramel drizzled under a lush head of ivory. Caramel, honey, cool squash, and a splash of oak brighten the air with the smell of a fall festival or a garden after the morning dew has evaporated.

Flavor / Palate - Spicy pumpkin rolls cling to the tongue after just two sips. Cream cheese and nutmeg follow before it morphs into a warm sweet finish. The barrel aging is evident but does not dominate; this is primarily a squash bomb in liquid form. By the end it becomes sticky. Overall though the strengths outweigh the weaknesses resulting in a very nice seasonal.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Thankfully, this tastes a whole lot better than the nose indicates... big body, roasted pumpkin and pie spice up front (lotta nutmeg and I think thats allspice Im tasting), toasty malt hiding in the background, some cidery notes but covered up by a medium sweetness, slight hint of the barrel and a bit warm on the finish.

Pours lightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge caramel, toffee, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, toast, brown sugar, gingerbread, oak, vanilla, bourbon, light chocolate, light roast, and toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of malt, spice, pumpkin, and barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, pumpkin, cinnamon, clove, nutmeg, toast, brown sugar, gingerbread, oak, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, and toasted earthiness. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, toast, brown sugar, gingerbread, oak, bourbon, vanilla, light chocolate, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of malt, pumpkin, spice, and barrel flavors; with a near perfect balance of all flavors and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a moderately creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged pumpkin ale!

I taste a lot of oak, alcohol, sweet malts and even a touch of vanilla. The beer leaves an autumn/winter-like feeling of warmness.

85,"2013-04-19",4.3,"THOUGHTS: A very different take on a pumpkin beer. Very elegant. And rare for a pumpkin beer, itll probably age well. Lots of bourbon and wood with just enough pumpkin and spice. Sour flavors also popped up from time to time to make it even more interesting. Hid alcohol fairly well. Bonus point for the Halloween marketing.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, dark amber with an average to large, off-white head that kept a thin sheet and left good lacing. The aroma had moderate caramel; wood; oak; bourbon; and pumpkin pie spices. The initial flavor was moderately sweet, lightly sour and slightly acidic; while the finish was heavily sweet, slightly sour and lightly bitter and acidic with an average duration. There was caramel, fruity pumpkin, slightly sour pumpkin, pumpkin pie spices, bourbon, wood, oak, alcohol, and pumpkin pie. The medium body was fairly creamy, but sticky on the lips and then dry with fizzy carbonation and lightly alcoholic and ever so slightly chalky finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"
85,"2013-03-27",4.3,"Another superb pumpkin ale, but not quite at the level of Southern Tier. More of a traditional barrel-aged ale, but with pumpkin influences. Dark pour, with pumpkin spiced scent. Absolutely solid malty base, with nutmeg, cinnamon and pumpkin notes, with lingering spiciness. Has a nice sweetness, perhaps from the aging? This is a big, bold beer that I quite like. It's a sipping beer for sure, and non-beer geeks may not appreciate the complexity that this one has that is lacking in the nevertheless goodness of Southern Tier's pumpkin ale.

85,"2012-12-26",3.9,"750ml bottle - $13.99 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Bottled on: 09/04/12

Appearance: Pours out a clear, deep, dark amber-hued body with a tall, foamy, yellowed head. Thin blips of sticky lacing on the way down.

Smell: Sweet-scented (but doesnt imply as much sweetness as comes across in the flavor) caramel, brown sugar, and coagulated dark amber honey. Toasty, crusty remnants. Squashy vegetal tones. Moderate spiciness. Vanilla, oak, and all the bourbon aromas youd hope for.

Taste: Sweet, sugary tastes of caramel, cooked honey, light-colored brown sugar and plenty of toasted pumpkin. Also, toasted pie crust accents. Pumpkin pie spicing thats exacerbated by the punchy alcohol. Vanilla and stern, angry-faced oak wood along with the strong bourbony flavor (I know, it says only oak, but it feels bourbony to me) letting loose a strong wave of alcohol warmth. Speaking of warmth, giving it some time to open up helps this one, either that or the alcohol is just kicking in and making me a bit more agreeable. Candyish, spicy, boozy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium carbonation.

Overall: I decided to take on this 750ml all by myself, just to make sure I had enough. WAIT I RAN OUT ALREADY. Its fairly good, but I would still lean toward Pumking, as this came across as a wee bit hot for me.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Pours a medium, well retained, ivory head, with some lacing, over a clear, amber SRM 16) body......nose is toffee/caramel, raisin, cinnamon, brown sugar, pumpkin....taste is sweet toffee/caramel, raisin, light plum, cinnamon, vanilla, barest hints of terpene, finishing dry, with pumpkin tones....mouth feel medium to thick, sticky, alcohol burn lightly present, carbonation low. The pumpkin, and spices balance nicely against the malt back bone, making for an intriguing and very complex beer. The alcohol burn is a bit too apparent, and is the only large flaw. But, overall, this has hints of becoming close to an Oloroso Sherry, except for the low ABV for any Sherry. BJCP 8/3/14/4/7","Salida, Colorado, USA","drjay44"

The pumpkin is apparent but not overwhelming and dominating the taste. Nutmeg, cinnamon, and spices help to downplay the pumpkin sweetness. The taste is semi-sweet. The malts add a bread character and the aftertaste is of spent cloves and vanilla. The oak character adds a nice lingering dimension to push it into a snifter and truly make it imperial.

Smooth, sweet entry with some brown sugar and a moderate spiciness (nutmeg and cinnamon are most prominent) paired with pumpkin flesh and a light dark fruitiness (raisin, fig) peaking through in the background that linger into the moderately dry finish where the oak makes its presence.  Crisp, tight carbonation paired with a medium texture, the dryness on the finish does a good job of offsetting the sweetness.

85,"2011-11-04",4.1,"My first reaction was, "" Wow.  This isnt the best pumpkin beer ive had, its the best beer ive had in a while.""  Gorgeous ruby colored pour with a beige two-finger head.  Pumpkin aroma with nutmeg, cinnamon, and cardamom.  Taste is pumpkin, a nice balanced malt/hop profile, perfume, and booze without being overly boozy.  The pumpkin flavor stands out without being overshadowed by spices.  Full bodied in the mouth.  A great beer.","Whalezbro, Illinois, USA","HighWine"
85,"2011-11-01",3.8,"Bottle: &nbsp Copper colored, ruby hues, moderate to large frothy off-white head, fairly sticky lacing. &nbsp Soft oak up front, otherwise some moderately spiced nutmeg and cinnamon that follow. &nbsp A smattering of oak, vanilla, bourbon, nutmeg, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie on the tongue. &nbsp The 10.3% ABV seems very well hidden. &nbsp Everything seems to be in moderation, nothing stands out as being dominant. &nbsp This is just as much as a barrel aged beer as it is a pumpkin beer. &nbsp Moderate to full body and mouthfeel. &nbsp This one feels pretty hefty. &nbsp The one thing I like about this is that it doesnt seem artificial. &nbsp Nice body, flavorful, long lasting, with a unique barrel aged twist. &nbsp One of the better Pumpkin Ales out there. &nbsp Thanks for the bottle Turd!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
85,"2011-10-31",4.2,"750 c&c from The Davis Beer Shoppe in Davis, CA. Pours ruddy copper with a fizzy, disappearing beige head. Aromas of pies spice and vanilla/bourbon. Full bodied.

85,"2011-10-31",4.2,"Caramel nose; pours a beautiful ruby-brown.  The oak overwhelms most of the pumpkin & spice notes, but with the sweet, malty alcohol backing it is a nice combination nevertheless.","Lakewood, Colorado, USA","ogiergrove"

85,"2011-10-28",3.6,"Bottle.  Pours a a glistening dark amber.  The top stays adequately covered in a thin sheet of grayish tan suds.  The nose has sweet caramelized sugar tones, pumpkin pie spice notes, boozy alcohol, and a dryish oak edging.

85,"2011-10-23",3.4,"750ml bottle.  Pours a light ruby brown with a big creamy off white head that retains well and laces the glass.

The aroma is more subdued than expected - some pumpkin spices with some vegetal metallic notes.

The flavor is sweet chocolate malts with lots of spices and decent bitterness in the finish.  The alcohol is well hidden.  The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with smooth carbonation.

Overall, an OK pumpkin.  Its subdued - even though its 10+%.  The spices seem a bit muddled and its overly sweet to my tastes.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"

85,"2011-10-22",3.4,"750ml bottle purchased at west lakeview. Fallfest with the wife!... Pours a deep mahogany, somewhat transparent, with more of a scotch ale type of resemblance and topped with a medium frothy light beige head that quickly recedes leaving a wispy film... Aroma consists of pumpkin oak and vanilla but to its detriment, a sharp metallic note is also present. Smewhat cola-ey as well with deeper caramel with noticeable carbonation it seems like... Flavors are sweet and malt forward with pumpkin notes combining with deeper, richer caramel toffee and vanilla oak tones. A somewhat bitter, slightly astrigent finish follows it all up. Carbonation is pretty lively and the body isnt as Davy as one would expect... The aroma really throws things off for me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

I love pumpkin beers but have never been blown away by a BA pumpkin, and this one was no different. Its a pretty good standard pumpkin beer but no real barrel presence in the  flavor/aroma. I suppose its just hard to barrel age a pumpkin beer.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"

85,"2011-10-04",4.0,"Bottled on 09-11.  The beer pours a clear, ruby, mahogany color with an average, fizzy, beige head which is mostly diminishing and leaves minimal lace.  The nose is pleasant with plenty of pumpkin pie notes (rich caramel, nutmeg, mace, sweet pie crust), lots of toasted notes, vanilla, faint fresh thyme, and slight shaved oak.  The flavor starts very rich but balanced with lots of toasted caramel, sweet vanilla, significant nutmeg and cinnamon, a nice pumpkin flavor, and brown sugar but shaved oak filters in with a bourbon-like spice, and a faint coffee note.  The palate is medium to full, nearly lively, velvety, and round.  The beer finishes average for the ABV with toasted caramel still, some brown sugar, shaved oak lingering, and bourbon spice.  I loved the richness and the spicing, and the oak really rounded out the flavor.  The pumpkin notes were a bit overwhelming at times but the beer drank like a table strength beer.  Not usually a fan of pumpkin beers but the richness, balance, and round oak notes make for a nice beer.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"
85,"2011-09-30",3.9,"Bottle @ The BeerMongers...  Poured deep, amber/reddish with an off-white head.  Noticeable spice, bit foamy and dry on the palate.

85,"2011-09-30",3.9,"750mL corked and caged bottle from a trade with Gription79, bottled 09.07.2011.  Thanks man!  Pours clear bright ruby red and orange with a 2-finger yellow-tinged head; some webby lacing as the head recedes.  Aromas of sweet pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, sweet dough, and vanilla.  The flavor is sweet pumpkin and brown sugar, lightly buttered dough, and mild pie spices and alcohol.  The finish consists of light buttery oak, but not overpowering.  Medium carbonation and medium/full body, a little warming, and verging on creamy; this is surprisingly easy-drinking for the ABV.  Im enjoying this, its a really tasty seasonal.  Nice amounts of spice, not overpowered by the barrel treatment, and well done overall.  [823]","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","Boliv"

85,"2011-09-25",3.5,"Bottle thanks to 17thfloor for sharing. Pours a deep amber with a small light beige froth. Aroma is nicely malty, rich bready pumpkin character with some strong spices, cinnamon, nutmeg, just a hint of woodiness. Flavor starts sweet with some vanilla, picking up the spices and some of the sweet bread. Finishes with a spiced cake character and a light bitterness, a touch of graininess that lingers. Medium to medium full body and a crisp carbonation. Nice beer the oak is very subtle on the classic pumpkin ales, flavor finishes just a bit poorly","Chicago, Illinois, USA","FunkyBrewster"
85,"2011-09-25",3.4,"Bottle.  Pours a somewhat flat, clear but dark murky looking, copper brown with a very small thin white head, might have poured like this due to the straight from the back of the fridge pouring temp.  Aroma is sweet pumpkin, with some nice toasty soft roasty hint of cocoa, has a really nice earthy, well integrated spice, pumpkin pie filling aroma that most other pumpkin beers dont have, round and full, maybe there are hints of bourbon and vanilla in there but they really just work to complement the pumpkin pie filling, nice nutmeg, nothing jumps out individually but they all work together for a singular aroma, some dates, raisins and cinnamon also.  Flavor isnt quite as interesting as the aroma, seemingly crystal malt and bitter black tea, some toasty bread, spicing leaves an odd bitterness, off-dry, really just tea like, pumpkin flavor is slight, more of a nutmeg and crystal malt thing with a seemingly hint of black malt or something sharply bitter.  Leaves a somewhat gross tannic bitterness on the lips after swallowing.  Palate is watery, very fine sizzling carbonation, very weak finish, nicely attenuated and the alcohol is very well hidden.  Really hard to get past this aftertaste.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"
85,"2011-09-24",4.2,"750ml.  Nice maple pour with thin off white head and some lacing.  Nose is fairly typical pumpkin ale with the normal fall spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, etc). Nose also has the hints of oak.  Taste follows the nose but is not overpowering on the spices.  Great buttery oak undertone with a nice warming finish.  This is a big time fall beer and the best I have had to date (albeit still September)","California, USA","48FanInCali"
85,"2011-09-23",3.4,"Bottle (bottled 8/26/11). First pumpkin beer of the season. Pours with a murky, deep bronze hued body and a pretty large, off-white, tan head. Close knit bubbles, creamy. Decent lace. Aromas of spice, a little bit of soggy grain/pumpkin vegital qualities, cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, biscuity, corn bread, very mild oak notes, light esters. Really minimal, if any bourbon or alcohol (well hidden if there is some). Flavors of spice, lightly starchy vegital notes that finish sweet and a bit metallic. Molasses, oak, alcohol, tannic, short duration. Some cinnamon and light bready notes, a hint of coffee. Bitter, grassy, vegital in the finish. Lots of a soggy malt character. Its not quite DMS (although it is often coupled with it), and I sometimes refer to it as wet dog, but I sadly dont have a better descriptor. Shockingly lively carbonation, lasting bitter, somewhat dry.  Lots of lingering graham cracker. Had to look up to see: yup, I have had Four+ Punkn...Imperial and a touch more characterful, but not much better. Could be cleaner.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
