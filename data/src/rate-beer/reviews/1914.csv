1914,"2017-06-12",3.9,"Draught at the Winter Feast, Dark Mofo. Pours a hazy golden amber, with a moderate off-white head, which lasts well and leaves good lacing. The aroma offers floral and spice hops, backed by caramel and white bread malt. Spice and floral hops up front give way to caramel malt in the mid-palate, with cleansing floral hops to finish. A delicious English-style ale.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"
1914,"2017-06-07",3.1,"750ml bottle into tulip glass. Hazy bronze/amber beer with large creamy head. Nose is malt and spicy hops. Fine carbonation. Taste is mild bitterness with a little zing. Finish is subtle caramel malt and metallic hops. Unsuprisingly English, true to style.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","TedE"
1914,"2017-03-26",3.1,"From bottle at Seven Sheds, Railton, Tasmania. Poured a crystal clear mid-amber with a thin white foamy collar that laced poorly. Carbonation moderate, average and medium to coarse. Aroma lightly of sweet fruits and slight malt. Taste is slight sweet with a hint of grain. Light body. Smooth with a slightly bitter short finish. A nice enough English style ale.","Tarragindi, AUSTRALIA","KeefOz"

1914,"2014-12-24",3.4,"Pours a hazy copper with a foamy off white head. Exceptional aromas of stonefruit, berries, citrus and floral notes. Taste is a little disappointing compared to the aroma. Sweet bready and biscuity malts. Slightly spicey","Highton, AUSTRALIA","mattyhennessy"

1914,"2013-09-01",3.6,"Big fluffy white head, reduces to a nice light head on top of a crystal clear copper beer.
Citrusy, doughy, caramel, spicy and plenty of malt.
A refreshing beer, toasted malts upfront, earthy hops, grassy and resinous. A light, easy drinking beer.
A good bitterness finishes off well, a good malty chewy beer. Full of light fruits and a little floral.

1914,"2012-09-28",3.5,"For mine this challenges Holgates ESB as a top flight locally made English style beer.  Masters the art of subtly yeah lacks no punch with Burton-on-Trent style powdery minerals, soft broad malts and a perfect balance of old world hops. Just goes to show good beers dont have to belt you over the head with resiny hops. Lovely wide palate structure.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"
1914,"2012-07-05",2.8,"Pour is cloudy caramel with white head. Aroma is mainly caramel notes and flavour profile is brown sugar and bread with some bitterness at the end. Not bad, but suspect it sat on a shelf somewhere too long.","Bentleigh, AUSTRALIA","Dredd"
1914,"2012-06-27",3.3,"750mL bottle. Pours clear golden with a nice big white head and a subtle floral aroma. Spicey/grassey in the flavour with a slight caramel backing. Very nice considering i dont normally go for English pale ales.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","Brenhophead"
1914,"2011-12-30",2.9,"Bottle at brewery poured into glass. Cloudy light copper orange with ok head and lace. Decent earthy and floral aromas mixed with a nice caramel and stonefruit. Nice complex malt character and decent bitterness, however finishes with an unpleasant residual yeast character. Ruined it somewhat for me.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","imaragingbull"
1914,"2011-11-10",4.3,"Green bottle (750ml). Pours clear copper-brown with a decent cream-white head that lasts. Heaps of English hops on the nose (flowery perfume, citrus with oranges dominating) on top of biscuity malts. Smooth refreshing palate with a perfect balance of caramel maltiness and dry hop bitterness. Extremely drinkable with a medium-light body and lowish carbonation. The large bottle size is justifiable for this style. Rather reminded me of a fresh pint of Timothy Taylor Landlord served in an English pub - for which there is no higher compliment.","FNQ, Australia, ","floydian1"
1914,"2011-07-13",3.0,"14-Jul-2011 - on tap at Beer Deluxe - Light ash malt and candy fruit aroma. Deep amber colour, with light good haze, ordinary head and suds lacing. Unusual fruity candy ash malt flavour. Ash malt and medium bitter hop finish, with lingering ash malt and light hop aftertaste. This beer is not my style but they seem to have pulled of a mix that works for me.","Glen Iris, AUSTRALIA","vanvenlo"

1914,"2011-04-01",3.4,"750ml bottle. Copper coloured with some red flecks scattered throughout. Big intense head of brown foam that crackles as it settles. Caramel malt aromas with nuts and toffee mixed in. Flavour is a little thin but not to the detriment of the beer. Palate is smooth and this is a pretty good beer overall.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"
1914,"2011-03-18",3.6,"Bottle. Just cloudy amber with a dense cream head. Aroma is floral with caramel, some spices and biscuits. A little overcarbonated but very alive-feeling. Tastes slightly sweet and very biscuity with some butterscotch, hazelnuts and flowers. Bitterness is just less than balancing. Slight touch of metal at the end? - if it was there I stopped noticing it . Rich and a little rustic. Much more complex malt character than usually found in Australian beer. Pretty tasty. Second glass with farmhouse cheddar and a pickled onion, yum. Started OK and then really drew me in.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
1914,"2010-11-13",4.0,"Bottle 750ml. Great beer. Aroma has lots of fruit (grapefruit, apple), and also biscuit. Taste is sweet, with bitter background, and long length. Palate is velvety, and medium bodied. Amber, with an exuberant frothy head.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","davidm"
1914,"2010-11-10",3.2,"Bottle. Pours a dark copper. Slightly hazy. Smallish light tan coloured head. Falls away leaving some lacing. Aromas are very subdued. Some earthy hops and just a hint of lemon. Not much else happening. Flavours are a little better. Some malt sweetness balanced by good hop bitterness. Sweetish after taste with some yeast character. Medium mouthfeel with low carbonation. OK beer.","AUSTRALIA","bluebetty"

1914,"2009-10-05",2.9,"On tap - A cloudy copper colour with fulffy white head. Nice woody/earthy hop aroma with some light caramel notes. Pleasant on the palate with caramel notes from crystal malts and some malt sweetness too, but finishes dry. Not a bad beer but has a character that I could only describe as ""home brewed"".","AUSTRALIA","BarossaLuke"
1914,"2009-08-26",3.4,"750ml Bottle - Clear, bronze gold body with a lasting white head. Hops on the aroma with just a bit of malt in the backgound. Light bitterness in the taste that softens moreso as you get into it, some lemon notes, some bubblegum and loads of yeast as you get to the bottom of the bottle. First bottle took me a little while to get into but the second one a week later or so was great.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","bluevegie"
1914,"2009-01-11",3.6,"750ml bottle -  Nice hoppy aroma. Pours a cloudy,  copper colour with a good off white head. Medium carbonation. Medium to full bodied.  Malty/caramel, fruity background with an abundance  of hop flavours (Fuggles and Goldings) and a moderately bitter finish. Very enjoyable.","Tasmania, AUSTRALIA","Thylacine"
