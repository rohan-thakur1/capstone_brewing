1340,"2017-05-21",3.5,"Growler to pint glass, where it appears an opaque brown with little head - the above commercial description seems off. Peat and caramel exude sweetness in the nose. Taste follows with strong toasted character and burnt caramel. The body is medium and is best suited as beer Id have when all I want are a couple.","","balloonbuffoon"
1340,"2015-05-24",3.6,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2015 Draught from evening star. Red brown pour. Deep chocolate caramel malts. Mid bodied. Pretty nice.","New York, USA","Maverick34"
1340,"2015-04-28",2.9,"On tap at Scion in Silver Spring, MD. 

Not quite opaque, dark brown with a small khaki head and fairly sparse lacing. 

Subtle aroma of toasted malt, brown sugar, berries, black cherry and citrus. 

Taste of toast, citrus, nuts, dark fruit, berries, dark cherry and brown sugar. 

Medium body and low/medium carbonization. Mouthfeel is slightly lacking , but nothing serious. 

I don't get why one would hop a Scottish ale. The hops are hardly overdone, but the malt and everything else here is already subtle and the hops hide it further. Disappointing.

Tastes of floral, light roast, toasty notes, biscuit, subtle dark fruit. Medium body with a dry finish. Enjoyable and well done for the style.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"
1340,"2013-08-17",3.6,"At the source. Draws a clear dark garnet with a light tan head, that like all Civil products is not big, but small bead and retentive, with lace. Caramel malt aroma. Has a maple, caramel, toasted bread and buttery flavor. Nice!","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
1340,"2013-08-12",3.6,"Too roasty. Had this at their tap room in saint Louis Fall 2012. Everything I tasted was good to great. This was not one of their better beers.","Arkansas, USA","BOSSbrewer"

1340,"2013-03-30",2.7,"On tap at 1839 Taphouse in Columbia. Pours a reddish brown color with white head. Caramel, earthy, scotch flavors. Hmmm, Ill pass on this one.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","jcnielsen"
1340,"2013-02-19",3.6,"A nice mix of hops and burnt sugars. The hops are a little more pronounced then Im use to for the style, but this is still quite enjoyable. Some citrus and caramel notes in there as well. 

Again, the hops and malts are neck and neck. The sugary sweetness is there, but still subtle. Very enjoyable and easy to drink.","Missouri, USA","ArrogantDusty"

1340,"2013-01-06",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2017 Tasted on tap at brewpub in a nonic half-pint glass. It poured a nice copper color with slight haze with buttery, lasting foam and lace. Malty, caramelly, nutty, biscuity, with a measured citrusy and resiny Cascades hop balance, thankfully not too much grapefruit/rhubarb. Unsurprisingly, Scottish malt and yeast can hold their own against an arrogant American ingredient. Medium body with restrained residual sweetness, medium carbonation. Unexpectedly smooth and creamy mouthfeel with long-lasting mildly fruity, peaty aftertaste. Another fabulously well-balanced, low-key but deceptively delicious Civil Life brew. Highly recommended.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"
1340,"2012-04-06",2.3,"Malty aroma.  Dark caramellization.  Thin tan head.  Very light on palate.  Not much to this.  Wish it was heavier.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","gregwilsonstl"
1340,"2012-03-24",3.6,"Draught at Bridge in St Louis. Big body of caramel, toffee. Malt bomb. Bit of cocoa cola as well.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
1340,"2011-11-25",3.7,"Tap at the brewpub served in a dimpled mug. Pours a cloudy brownish amber with a small but sticky off-white head. Aroma of big toasty and chocolate malts, cocoa, tobacco, earth, and mild coffee. Flavor of the same big toasty and chocolate malts, mild coffee, toasted brown sugar, nuts, and wood. Medium body with moderate carbonation and a toasty, malty mouthfeel. Another great malty beer from these guys. Hell yes.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
1340,"2011-11-19",3.6,"Sampled at the STL Hops anniversary party - Pours dark brown with a tan head.  The aroma has caramel, spice, toastiness and an overall cleanness.  Medium smooth body with light prickliness and mild carbonation.  The taste is much like the aroma along with dry caramel, light cocoa and a bit of spice.  The finish is clean and has a little hop bite.  Really enjoyable scotch ale.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
1340,"2011-11-12",3.5,"Sampled at the StlHops 4 th Anniversary party.  This pours dark brown opaque with a light colored tan head.  Soggy malt in the nose with a bit of cinnamon.  A malty flavor, too.  Some chocolate and a bit of grass.  Nice","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
