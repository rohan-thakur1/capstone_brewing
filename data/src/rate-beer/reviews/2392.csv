2392,"2015-01-10",3.3,"Tap at New Bohemia in the classic bumped pint glass this place is known for. Really wish they would splurge for the actual pint glasses. Nice red appearance with about a half finger of head. Aroma has some tropical notes with a pleasant brightness. Taste has mostly bitter elements with that lingering resin aftertaste. Surprisingly very little on the malt front. Basically malts used to impact the appearance. It was initially aggressive but eases off the throttle as the consumption continues. Im not really digging this one but you could do worse.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"

2392,"2014-09-01",3.1,"Draft at the brewery. This may have been the least interesting beer here, but still quality. Theres little aroma to speak of. They drink with a solid caramel malt, perhaps a slight sting. In short: its a red ale. (#5658, 8/28/2014)","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
2392,"2014-08-28",3.8,"Dark amber pour, clear. Wooden, earthy nose. Toffee, maple, and heavily steeped, pungent black tea. Green, leafy bitterness counters quietly. Dark and firm, with the midrange notes being especially strong, while the normally louder bright hop and deep malt syrup notes are subtler.

Raspberry, red apple skin, earthy malt. It feels like it should taste husky and gruff but it doesnt. Golden leaves and rustic wooden character. Dry caramel, pears, brown sugar. Medium-full palate, with gentle carbonation and generally dry texture.

The finish is bittersweet, candied grapefruit. This is a lovely little example. It is not outstanding in any regard, but for what it lacks: fruit cocktail sugars, iced tea astringency, and plain doughy malt. A throwback to an outdated model, that always had some merit.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

2392,"2013-05-29",3.8,"Appearance:
Cherry and mahogany woods with garnet highlights settle under a full khaki head. Swirls creamy with woodsy hues and a few spots of lace.

Nose:
Pine trees, forestry, and rustic wood cabins. Dense pine and fir trees sticky with saw and glistening with dew. Hop oils. Burnt toffee and treacle underneath and in the back. Whisper of evergreen.

Palate:
Nice full mouthfeel, medium weight, and just a little bit sticky. Whole red apples including the orchard in the back are both sweet and bitter at the same time. Rustic parching finish of pine cones, sticks, twigs, and log cabins. Pine sap mingles with mint mingles with bitter sticky hop resins. Burnt sugars hold it all together atop a crunchy melba underbelly. Mint leaf in the breath.

Final Thoughts:
Another solid beer from the fine folks at Steel Toe Brewing. Thanks to the generosity of my sister, I have been able to enjoy many beers from this upstart brewery which is putting out some solid beers. I was lucky enough to get one more bottle of Rainmaker Double Red Ale and it was just as good as the first one.

Taste is really heavy on the bitterness and prickly hops up front.  Pine resin and pineapple come to mind.  The caramel malts form a backbone, if you can call it that considering the hops are the real star here.

Mouthfeel is bitter and not nearly as sweet as most ambers.  Pretty full in body for an amber.

2392,"2012-03-30",3.3,"Date: March 30, 2012 Mode: Bottle Source: Liquor Barrel Description: Translucent brownish red with nice head and lacing.  Aroma was malty / caramel and citrus hops.  Taste started with the malt / caramel and then moved into a bitter citrus (grapefruit) and a tad bit of soap in the finish that was not super pleasant.  Seemed a little thin, maybe watery, and slight carbonation.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
2392,"2012-03-25",4.0,"22 oz thanks to portableparty.  Brilliant, brilliant red/brown in color with off-white/yellow-hued head.  Gentle citrus and pine hopping with a smooth caramel/toasted malt sweetness.  Flavor follows suit with a mildly sweet toasted malt/light caramel backbone that gives way to a solid citrus/mild pine hop bitterness.  Faint skunkiness.  Nice residual citrus/grapefruit finish.  Light, subtle carbonation.  This is at the top of the game for ambers.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
2392,"2012-03-22",3.6,"Pour on tap at Winterfest 2012, pour was dark amber/red with a nice slightly off white head, aroma brought notes of caramel, slight grass and pine, hints of spicy yeast, touch of bready malts with an earthy quality as well.  Taste has a slight smoky/roasted quality with some pine and grass up front, nice rich caramel, spice and earth notes mix in the middle, slightly watery but fairly dry finish.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
2392,"2012-03-19",3.8,"22 ounce bottle that pours a dark copper color, aromas of citrus, roasted malt, caramel, and pine.  Flavor is malt, hops, pine, and citrus.  These flavors blended nicely together to make this a real enjoyable beer.","Florida, USA","burg326"
2392,"2012-03-10",3.7,"recd in trade from emeinz; thx Eric!  dark amber pour with lacing...  slight toffee aroma with roasted malts.  Taste is same with a good sized amount of hop kick - lot of hop and roasted malt - high rating for me on a beer with this much hops - it works!!",", Texas, USA","crajun"
2392,"2012-03-07",3.7,"Pours a deep mahogany with  tan head. Aroma full of roasted malts with an underlying sweetness. Really taste the hops and a slightly bitter finish. Liked it. Thanks to DalzAle for sending this Steel Toe my way.","Florida, USA","newcigarz"
2392,"2012-02-20",3.9,"Bomber from Guerde! Pours dark ruddy copper with a creamy/foamy beige head. Aromas of citrus, pine and roast malt. Med+ body. Flavor is very citrusy hoppy with some heavy roasted malt. Its bitter. Its good. Finishes a bit harsh - guessing from the roast malt. Could be the hop tho - theres a lot of hop.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
2392,"2012-02-09",3.7,"Pours a nice ruby color with a medium tan head...nice lacing...good color.  Aroma is doughy with some mildy sweet citrus hop notes.  Aroma follows suit up front but quickly turns very bitter...earthy with notes of rye.  Mouthfeel is medium and the finish is earthy and bitter.","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"
2392,"2012-02-05",3.4,"Sampled at Winterfest 2012.  Pours a deep red with thin white head.  Aroma is malty, sweet, and a bit alcoholic.  Flavor much the same.","Hudson, Wisconsin, USA","DasBierChef"

2392,"2012-02-01",3.7,"Bomber courtesy of a trade with Atom.  Pours a clear reddish amber with a moderate tan head that lasted until mid-glass and left partial lace.  Pleasant aroma of toffee with a bit of roast.  The flavor begins with a solid dose of toffee and light roast, followed by some fairly resinous pine leading to a moderately bitter finish.  Medium bodied.  Nice solid ale.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
2392,"2012-01-16",3.7,"Approximately half of a 22 oz. bottle, poured into a glass, as always (Ill save the remainder for tomorrow). Fresh, appetizing, piney, dry hops smack the nostrils and instantly make my mouth water. Citrus, peach, resin, maple syrup, and biscuit scents. Just a tinge of barnyard funkiness, but not in an off-putting way (Is that intentional? I have my doubts, but I dont mind it so I wont penalize the aroma in my score; hedonic scale and whatnot.). Excellent aroma; one of the better-smelling beers Ive had in awhile. Pours a clear, medium brown with a slight copper hue and light effervescence. Moderate amount of beige to taupe head. Produces good lacing. Dry, hoppy taste features saltine cracker, matzo, caramel, apricot, and red grape flavors (though the last two do not come across in a sweet way at all). Grapefruit, lemon, and pine needle from the hops. Flavor is consistent with aroma and pretty good, but the flavor does not live up to the aromas excellence. Dull, doughy yet dry finish. Very good, long, dry aftertaste that alone earns the palate a point above average. Medium body. Lively in the palate. Steel Toe Rainmaker Double Red Ale is a well-made brew. Its a professionally executed and promising effort from a young brewery. I was expecting either an American Strong or Amber Ale profile, but, ultimately, this comes across as an India Pale Ale, albeit one with a slightly darker than typical appearance. If it had been labeled as an IPA, I would not have batted an eye upon consuming it (and I would have given it an identical score; hedonic scale and whatnot).","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

2392,"2011-12-20",3.6,"Bomber. Poured lovely crystal-clear medium garner with a well-retained beige head. The aroma picked up sweet caramel and redder fruits with fresh accents of spruce and earth.. well-balanced.  The flavor found toasty caramel, fruits, and biscuity notes, again with fresh bitterness around.. pine needles and plenty of residual sugars on the finish.  Medium-bodied and a bit grainy on the palate.. OK balance, but I drank it a bit too warm.. solid stuff!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
2392,"2011-12-15",3.5,"22 oz bottle purchased at The Four Firkins in St Louis Park, Minnesota. I also had this on draft at the brewery tasting room.  The pour is golden darker copper with a khaki head that fades pretty quickly.  The aroma is resinous, big hops right off - grapefruit and floral, along with a decent blast of caramel malt sweetness.  Big nose.  The taste is the big resinous floral and grapefruit citrus hops, transitioning to a dry caramel malt, which had a bit less sweetness than the nose suggested.  Fresh.  The palate is medium bodied, lower carbonation level, finishing dry and almost woody.  This beer is heavy handed, though certainly seemed to be the intention.  Distinctive.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
2392,"2011-12-03",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2013 Tap at the brewery. Golden amber pour, somewhat red. Nice clingy head. Fantastic bouquet of citrus hop and caramel malt. Medium palate. Pine resin and citrus hop taste. Great brew!","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"

Pour is dark amber with a nice thick off white head.
Aroma of caramel and toasted malt, nice citrusy hop aroma, lighter floral/pine hop.
Flavour is nice citrusy hop, toffee/caramel and brown bread maltiness make it very drinkable.
My first Steel Toe brew, and very impressed here. Looking forward to trying their lineup.","Lakeville, Minnesota, USA","Trev"

2392,"2011-10-29",3.9,"Sampled on draught at the Steel Toe tap room in St. Louis Park, MN. Pours a clear dark copper amber colored brew with a creamy off-white head that slowly dissipates and leaves behind some excellent lacing. Aroma of both cascade-ish and citrus hops, caramel malt, and a hint of floral hops. Taste is medium to full bodied, flavors of caramel malt, citrus zest and a hint of pine. Finish has a mild bitterness with some extra caramel malt and citrus hop aftertaste that slowly disappears. A solid imperial amber ale, throughout.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
2392,"2011-10-15",3.9,"Bottle.  Dark brown amber pour, lasting 1/2 inch head and a nice citrusy hop and malt aroma.  Flavor is nice spicy malt, mellow sweet caramel with dry and lasting hops on the aftertaste.  Very good, and priced well.  Would like to see an imperial version of this, as this reminds me of a dialed back version of Tongue Buckler (which is the best Imperial Red Ive ever had).","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","DalzAle"
2392,"2011-10-14",3.8,"On tap at brewery. Pours a copper red with a big soapy kahki head that fades to a thin film and collar. Aroma malty caramel and little metallic and spruce. Taste is bitter grapefruit hops and malty caramel,  the bitterness is awesome. Palate is medium and fizzy with full bitterness throughout and finishes dry. Pretty good stuff!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"
