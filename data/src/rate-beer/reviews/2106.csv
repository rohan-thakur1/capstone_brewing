2106,"2017-04-09",3.9,"Bardzo dobrze nachmielone piwo. Czuć, że nie jest to IPA - jest jakby bardziej kremowe w smaku, mimo, że wcale nie ma jakoś specjalnie dużo ciała. Poza tym smaki mocno chmielowe, ale nie ziołowe - mieszanina suszonych owoców, jakieś kwiatowe nuty.Trochę za bardzo jak dla mnie wychodzi Galaxy, za którym nie przepadam.","Kraków, POLAND","evannell"

2106,"2016-03-04",3.8,"Aroma of white pepper, raspberries and strawberries burst through a biscuity and rich nectarous veil. Hazy gold yellow with a dense just off-white, persistent creamy head. The fruit later gives way to general tropical citrus character in the aroma. The flavour isnt quite as impressive as the aroma, being quite muddled, but there is an apricot flavour and tropical citrus character being restrained by biscuity malt and the finish gives that white pepper flavour which is still very nice. Carbonation is ideal and cant really fault the texture.","Bristol, Somerset, ENGLAND","leebotton"
