3970,"2014-08-10",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2015 Honey-flavored and oak-aged, but otherwise very typical black IPA, the first beer in a series of four in which three breweries participate. Highly hopped with Mt. Rainier, Citra and Simcoe. Beige, creamy, sticky head, colour very opaque brown, near black. Aroma of coffee, grapefruit, mango, leather, bitter honey, cedar wood, liquorice. Soft dry taste, smooth and supple without the oily texture that would typify a heavy stout, spicy, woody, roasted bitterness increasing towards the finish, complex and very, very dry in the end. I bet this would make an excellent companion for a good cigar.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Im really divided as to how to score this: As a beer, this is a fantastic brew, worthy of a score in the low 4s; on the other hand, as a Bglack IPA, this is a rather weak example of the style, and could score in the low 3s or even high 2s as a Black IPA.

As with the Jail Alai Cedar Aged, the cedar is not too enjoyable a quality to me and this beer feels like theyve tried to throw too many elements into one beer. Still great for what it is.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

3970,"2011-07-14",4.1,"Poured from an 12 ounce bottle into a Spiegelau tulip. Purchased along with Either at Cigar City Brewing taproom on 11/20/10.

Appearance: Pours a coffee black color with a 1finger foamy tan head consisting of tiny carbonation bubbles. Excellent lacing.

Smell: Piney hops, sweet roasted malt and a touch of molasses.

Taste: Pine dominates up front then sweet malt and a cedar and white pepper in the middle before ending with toasted malt and burnt toast at the finish. Aftertaste is a mix of burnt toast and hoppy bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a fairly high amount of carbonation. Goes down smooth.

Drinkability: Good drinkability. This is a sipper due to the high ABV%, but you wont have any trouble finishing it off in the least.

Overall: Very good beer overall. I actually liked this a little better than Or, which may be due to the fact that a little age has taken some of the bite off it. Another strong offering from Cigar City.","Fort Myers, Florida, USA","adam42381"

Nose is very big and assertive, with resinous hops being foremost initially: piney, lime and pineapple, and hint of sweet simcoe. Body is fairly full, with the healthy carbonation seeming to enliven all the flavors. Theres a ton going on too, with honey, toffee, hints of molasses, and grain along with the strong citrus and hops presence. But instead of giving the brew more range and character, it ended up for me being a bit too sweet and grainy, with the result being that the roasts and the hop bite were flattened a bit. Still enjoyable but was hoping for more.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

3970,"2011-05-28",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2011 Bottle. An opaque black beer, with a small. frothy, almost fully collapsing brown head. The aroma is moderately malty, moderately hoppy.

The flavour is heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Almost full body, round mouthfeel, lively carbonation, very long finish with nearly heavy bitterness, moderately alcoholic. The first words that come to my mind are challenging and stimulating, The honey is a nice complement in both aroma and flavor, The malts taste more roasted in the flavour, to the point of being burnt, charred, but pleasant, The hops shine in the finish, but not only, the cedar gives a spiciness thats not overwhelming, but instead adds complexity to the product.

But only slightly. In this brew, you will find burned toast, honey, chocolate, licorice and a bitter hop profile that seems to present itself at various moments.

3970,"2011-04-08",4.3,"Appearance: black and viscous. A fluffy espresso crema head leaves a collar bordering crema bubbles. Swirls thick along the edges, no lace, and a thin sheen of crema foam lingers on topthen disappears.

Nose: fudgy, roasty, dark fruits  meaty & chewy. Thick caramel nougat. Vanilla bean along edges. Cooked than cooled honey melts into and with the nougat. Woody earthiness with a hint of char and tar. Bacony greasy smoky essence in the back; like standing in front of a smoker, oily. Rooty. Tar balls. Figs, dates, prunes.

Palate: grabs top center of tongue and never lets go. Not as thick as expected  soft, frothy, almost cakey mouthfeel. Burnt finish builds with ash, burnt black cacao. Honey and fudge, caramel and toffee. Sweet smoke in the back. Cinnamon sticks in the breath. Meaty dark fruits join finish  prunes and figs especially. Fast procession of flavor with each quaff is intense and continues from first quaff to last. More burnt wood and ash. Mouth starts to water as it dries. Dryness of tannins  wood and leather. Has a sense of brewing times past. Bakers chocolate. The honey is a subtle touch  more cooked than fresh. Warmth grows in chest and breath. Salty umami savoriness.

Final Thoughts: wow and wow. Definitely a sipper but a fine sipper at that. Beer boring? Paf! Beer is living and beer is tasty and oh my goodness how I love it.

Initial is fuller bodied, a nice roasty start with sweet honey, raisins and dark fruit meshing with caramel, PacNW hops throw citrus, pine, and florals blend into sweet malts, the roast fades back with raisins, honey, and some cocoa, sweet caramel and roast back in. The hops fade out a bit as the beer gets a bit big and sweet, sticky caramel and raisins. Roast and cocoa. Ok, perhaps there is a bit of age on it..

An ok beer, but Im baffled as to how this is Top 3 in this category.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3970,"2011-03-27",4.1,"Of course this beer is exactly what I thought it would after having Or a while ago and also tasting the two together. Aroma is hoppy, citrusy fruity hops that blend in nicely with the subtle sweet maltiness that has notes of fudge, caramel, bread crust and chocolate. The honey also comes through a bit in the nose. Taste is very bitter from both the hops and the roast. Slightly piny and citric, coffee roast, notes of salmiak liquorice and toasted wood. Alcohol is rather well hidden, but sometimes it somes out clearly. It plays well with the hops, so it doesnt lower the score. I really dig this series, but I cant decide which one I like the most. I was baffled by Or when I had it the first time, I preferred Or to Either when I had them side by side, but now this tastes better than I remember any of them. All I can determine is that they are both very well-crafted ales that Im glad to have tried.","Copenhagen (formerly Aalborg), DENMARK","phredrik"

3970,"2011-03-14",3.7,"Sampled February 2011
A vigorous pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a four-finger thick, nicely brown stained, dark tan colored head.  The head leaves lots of layered lacing on the sides of my glass as it slowly subsides.  The beer is a concentrated, dark-chocolate brown color that is quite opaque when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of slightly dirty, tangelo zest, lychee and sweet ruby-red grapefruit juice; I say dirty because a backdrop of roasted malt contributes a burnt edge as well as an earthy quality to what would otherwise be a bright hop fruitiness.  The hops also seem to contribute a woodiness that reminds me a bit of pine, but a bit more spicy and I realize that this is likely accentuated by the cedar used in this brew.  The cedar is actually fairly subtle and from the nose I wouldnt have guessed it was here if I didnt already know about it as it melds quite well with the hop notes.  Touches of cocoa are found here and, in combination with the hops, remind me of orange flavored truffles; at times the chocolate aromatics can be quite prominent, but usually the hops are the clear dominant note in the nose.

This has a rich creamy texture to it as it first hits my tongue; this accentuates a rich chocolate flavor found in the middle of this beer, but this morphs into a bitter roast character in the finish.  The hop character contributes the bulk of the bitterness in this beer, but the roast malt definitely contributes as well.  Lingering herbal and pine notes also linger in the finish and are actually found through out the flavor profile of this beer (though it is more noticeable towards the finish of a sip than at the beginning).  The bright hop fruitiness of the nose is not nearly so prominent in the flavor; the roast in combination with the hop character contributes notes of lightly burnt fruit (tangelo zest, orange zest, grapefruit towards the middle and finish, and some lychee / tropical fruit notes that seem to get muted quite a bit by the roasted character) .  Some spicy, warming alcohol is noticeable towards the finish and seems to mix in with a spicy, woody note that must be contributed by the cedar.  There is quite a bit of roast character to this beer; it contributes a rich toasted whole grain note, a toasted spicy rye note (which is likely quite influenced by the cedar), some full city roast coffee bean notes that lean towards earthy, and some bitter roast coffee notes towards the finish.  The body of this beer is actually fairly rich, it seems to have a lot more texture than the Or and is most definitely a beer to be savored and sipped; it perhaps drinks a little lighter than its actual strength, but not by a whole lot.

Definitely a tasty beer, it seems a bit less hop focused (at least in the flavor), or you could say more malt balanced, than the Or.  I am not quite too sure which one I have enjoyed more.  As in the Or, the roast malt, alcohol, cedar and hops can combine to be a touch harsh, though not overly so.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3970,"2011-02-25",4.3,"12oz bottle my brother brought back from Tampa, thanks Jeff! Compared side-by-side with ""Or."" Pours a black body with a finger-width, dense and creamy, darker brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing throughout. Aroma is very similar to the ""Or,"" but a tad bit richer in the malts and sweeter in the citruses. Heavy caramels, tons of toasted cedar, juicy and piney citruses, lots of tobacco, some roast, spiced earth, cocoa, resins, and a touch of bread. Flavor is sweet caramels with lots of juicy, citrus pines up front. Tons of charred cedar come in with lots of roasts, tobacco, and dry cocoas. This does maintain more of a sweetness and hop juiciness than the ""Or,"" but they are very close. Lots of bitter orange peel comes out towards the end along with some spices, more earth, and a touch of bread as this finishes very dry and bitter with tons of biting and resiny pines, juicy citruses, toasted cedar, heavy roasts, and tobacco all balanced nicely by a solid caramel and cocoa. Very lengthy aftertaste following a medium, very soft and creamy, almost full body with a soft, creamy, medium carbonation. Overall, this beer along with the ""Or"" are right up my alley.

A- Body is a dark, aboding motor oil black hue. Pours with a 1-2 finger creamy dark tan head. Honestly-this brew has big imperal stout written all over it in the appearance- Lacing left all the way down the glass.

S- The nose is very interesting and quite contrasting. Imperial coffee stout meets DIPA-lots of grapefruit, citrus, roasted malt, the smallest hint of wood, dark chocolate, and a hint of alcohol.

T- Smooth creamy dark chocolate and woody flavors highlight (somewhat) upfront, minimal honey and cedar-accents of citrus above this. The finish is much more stout than IPA as well-with roasted malt and smooth dark chocolate and a hint of wood/honey coming through. What lingers is crazy moderate to strong hop bitterness and a hint of roasted malt bitterness-actually its hard to tell the difference between the battling bitterness

M- Medium to high carbonation. Moderate to heavy weight sticky, oily body. The hop oils mix in well here.

D-This is probably the most complex black ale I have had yet. The hop/malt contrast here is huge (and weird of course-but thats just the style). Overall this is good-but a little bitter for my tastes. Mouthfeel is phenomenal. THIS makes me look forward to some Hill Farmstead

3970,"2011-02-02",3.8,"Common Rating for Either Black Ale  and Or Black Ale
In short: Big boozy roasted chocolaty beer with aggressive green and resinous bitterness.  Good sipper.
How: Bottles 12oz (Either + Or) side by side, fresh, about 1 month after the beers release
The look: Black body topped by a medium beige head leaving good lacings.  Either version has a slightly better head retention.
Mostly common between OR and EITHER versions: Uber-hoppy nose with a very fresh green hop peletts signature.  Taste has chocolate, medium roasted level, some dry wood.  There is a little toasted wood notes that dry out the beer a bit but I would not have guessed this was cedar barrels aged.  Very assertive bitterness that is both citrusy and resinous.  Appropriately smooth carbonation.  Tasty aggressive beer that are nonetheless pleasant to drink.
Differences between OR and EITHER versions: Either was more chocolaty and had a richer fuller body.  Or version had more honey sweetness.  Alcohol was a bit more apparent in Or version and was a bit bothersome. 
Bottom line: I found the Either (8-4-7-4-15=3.8) more interesting than the Or (8-3-7-3-14=3.5).  Im surprised by this result because I usually much prefer Hill Farmstead products over Cigar City.  The girlfriend and I drank both beers in presence of the Hill Farmstead assistant brewer.  He was very curious to know my opinion.  I told him the truth that I preferred the Cigar City version.  My mother always told me that it cost nothing to be honest.  And my father also told me that stealing peoples wallets not only costs nothing but can also generate a little profit.

This pours a pitch black color and topped by a pillowy head of mocha colored foam that shows great retention. Sticky rings of lace cling to the glass. This almost looks like a stout in the glass. The aroma is full of chocolate roast while helps balance out the huge citrus and grassy hop bitterness. Some spicy cedar comes through on the back end along with subtle notes of tobacco and honey. The flavor follows suit and shows the rich and roast chocolate malt base along with notes of sweet honey, dark fruits, and tobacco. The grassy hops add ample bitterness while the cedar adds a nice spicy character as well. The huge malt bill balances out the hop bitterness really nicely. Full bodied, round, and smooth with balanced carbonation that leads to a slightly sticky and roasty finish.

Taste is similar to aroma.  Like a hopped-up, rich, brown ale.  The hops are somewhat muted.  More piney than fruity.  No sense of high abv in this whatsoever.

This is more of a super rich brown ale with hops whereas Or is more of an ipa with an excessive amount of toasted malts and grains.

3970,"2010-12-17",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Rich caramel malts evolve alongside proud cedar and toasted notes, as vanilla spiciness and citrusy hops provide complexity.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam surfs the brown-edged blackness.
-The flavor profile is engaging, but could be better polished, overall.
-Alcohol is very well hidden; this is a nice strong ale that can be treacherous.
-The soft effervescence leaves room for plenty of flavors to take over the palate.

3970,"2010-12-09",4.0,"Bottle. Poured into a large tulip glass a dark brown/black color with a nice fluffy tan head that is slow to recede. The aroma doesnt seem to be as strong as OR but still has a nice roasted malt, hops, and woody character. The taste is a tad bit mellower as well than OR. Starts off sweet with some nice cedar wood notes then at the end you get a nice hop bitterness. Slightly warming alcohol as well in the end. Medium mouthfeel. Nice lace on the glass as the head settles. Letting this one sitt in the mouth is quite the experience with all the flavors making their presence felt at one time or another, sweet mollasses, honey, cedar, and hops and swirl together.

A very nice caramel, chocolate and roast nose, but a large cedar component. A lovely flavor; huge dry earthy cedar, spicy and fruity, a light fruity hop, roasted malts, light woody bitterness, wonderful. A lot of roasted porter-like elements here, but hops and a massive cedar make it exceptional. Cant wait to try Or. Re-rate: what a beautiful pour. Guinness like, black a rich beige head.

3970,"2010-12-01",3.1,"Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass.

Pours near black with a half-finger tan head after a hard pour. Retention isnt the best. There is a touch of lacing around the edges of the glass, as well as a bit of bubbling on the top of the liquid. A good swirl kicks back up a pretty good head, and theres quite a bit more lacing after that. The nose is fairly intense with some nice roast and chocolate notes, reminding me of a lighter imperial stout. Through the malt character comes a strong dose of earthy hops with a bit of pine.

The flavor is lush and thick, aided by the hefty mouthfeel. There are undertones of star anise throughout, coming in alongside quite a bit of booze. There are slight notes of chocolate, though the hops really arent all that present here. Mouthfeel is quite thick, with alcohol taking over in the finish to the point where its all thats left after a second or two. 

At this point, this beer is just way too boozy. Picking this up, I hadnt bothered to look at the alcohol content and I slightly regret opening this bottle at this point in time. I really think its more toward the American Strong Ale category, and there arent all that many hops to fall out with a bit of aging.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"

Nose is rich dark chocolatey malt, hops, cacao, a tad more malt in the nose than the Or, but at least 90% homologous by my estimation.  Tastes chocolatey malty, smooth, rich, complex, with mid-palate hops.  The hops are piney, and the malt bill is huge, yet the alcohol is very well hidden.  Like the Or, the malt is up front and the hops hit late, and I got some tropical fruit notes in this as it warmed.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

The aroma is a mix of dark roasted malts, chocolate, sweet citrus hops, black licorice spiciness and then a touch of sweet toffee. Theres a lot going on here where the sweet smelling citrus hops sort of float around in the background. The taste enters slick and smooth and even drying with dark roasted malts with a tinge of tart malt astringency. I also get ample amounts of blended malt sweetened citrus hops and then to midway notes of chocolate, toffee and spicy black licorice pick up and come to the surface. Into the finish the chocolate note begins to feel velvety smooth as a supporting note of caramel wells up along with a modest level of bitter pine hops.

3970,"2010-11-25",3.4,"""Acquired"" from grassrootsVT in a set with ""Or"". Tasted side by side.

Pours a thick viscous black with some off-white/pale tan head that fades down to nothing. The head on ""Or"" is a little darker and more creamy.

Nose: Lots of dark roasted malts, black coffee (think Folgers not starbucks), something like white mushroom, marshmallow, smoke, rough-cut barn boards, and forest floor (dried leaves, pine needles, etc). Smells slick and sweet compared to OR.

Palate: Holy cedar boards, Batman! Once the shock of the cedar wears off, theres lots of sticky sweet raisin-y fruit, figs and dates, fruit leather, over-roasted coffee beans. Bitterness seems to come from the wood and is somewhat astringent. Big and sweet.

Notes: Greatly preferred ""Or"" over this one. Either is big and sweet, with too little carbonation. The sweet fruit notes plus the cedar is cloying and confusing. Im sort of disappointed with the cedar treatment here because I was really impressed with the Humidor Jai Alai and theyre judicious use of wood. If you can only pick one, take the ""Or"" for sure.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","SFLpunk"

3970,"2010-11-17",4.0,"Bottle from Knightly.  Sampled the same night as the Or.  Dark pour; nearly black, with a thin tan foam on top that gets pushed off to the sides.  The aroma shows some hefty leafy hops and pine needles, along with tree-like woody notes, a very light dark fruity scent, and citrus following all of that.  The cedar comes out a lot more in the flavor, especially after it sits in the glass.  Sharp cedar and pine hops provide an edge but soft caramel and lightly creamed chocolate really mellow and smooth out the flavor.  Not as brash as expected.  The Or version, while quite tasty, was the more aggressive of the two.  Soothing alcohol warmth but very drinkable for what it is.

3970,"2010-11-12",4.0,"Draft at Redlight Redlight.  I had the ""Either"" and the ""Or"" side by side, and will combine my rating for comparison purposes.  The score for this entry is the ""Either"" version.Either.  This is the Florida version with the pale malt base and all pellet hops.  Also pouring pitch black, the body props up a moderate, spongy, mocha colored head that lasts for a good long while.  Sticky, feathered bands and flares of lacing coat the glass well.  The overall appearance rivals just about any imperial stout.  Speaking of which, the nose is far more balanced and stout-like than the Or version, as rich chocolate roast does well to assuage softer citrus and grassy hops.  Cedar is less prominent (you actually have to search for it), and there are deeper nuances of tobacco and dark fruit.  Flavors follow suit, showing a rich, roasty chocolate malt base with notes of stewed figs and maybe even some black strap molasses.  Grassy hops are still there en masse, but they are far more rounded and subtle.  The same can be said for the cedar, which lends just a bit of soft spice throughout.  Mocha really comes through on the finish.  On the palate, the roundness of the huge malt contingent is evident as the hefty body rolls and glides over the tongue.  Carbonation is spot on, which is to say softly persistent.  The finish is sticky and somewhat cloying, but not overtly so.  Overall, I found this to be much more approachable and well rounded.  Both are very good beers, but this one would be my top choice.  ""Either"" score: 8/5/8/3/16 = 4.0Or.  This is the Denmark/Vermont version with the Pilsner malt base and bittering hop resin.  The body is basically pitch black, sporting a moderately sized, smooth, cappuccino colored head that settles fairly quickly to a thin surface film.  Tall feathers of sticky lace cling hard to the glass.  Aromas are intensely hoppy and green, loaded with leafy resins and alpha acids.  Orange pith lends a bold citrus hop contingent, and spicy cedar serves as a nice compliment to this aspect.  In the malt base, dry chocolate and toasted caramel are accompanied by notes of toasted bread crust.  Flavors again kick off with the strikingly bitter, green, resinous hops and the peppery cedar, which prove dominant over the underlying dry, dark, bittersweet cocoa.  Caramel and dry chocolate roast come across almost ashy at points, intensifying the bitterness of the hops.  The palate, as expected for an 11% beer of this nature, is quite weighty, sporting smooth, even-keeled carbonation and sticky, tacky finish.  Overall, I liked it quite a bit.  Its certainly the more aggressive and unbalanced of the two.  ""Or"" score: 7/4/7/3/16 = 3.7","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
