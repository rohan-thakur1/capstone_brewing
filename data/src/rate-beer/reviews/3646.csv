Aroma is enticing with rich malts, brown sugar, brandy fruitiness, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, tobacco raisins... and the list goes on. Taste is sweet but not overly so with amazingly rich malts, brandy fruitiness, bourbon, vanilla, tobacco, raisins, molasses, brown sugar and a well dosed alcohol heat. Full body. Moderate carbonation. Sirupy mouthfeel. Warming - but never burning - finish. Once again, AleSmith show how barrel-aging should be done and how incredibly rich and deep a malt base can be.

3646,"2015-11-05",4.4,"Enjoyed at a tasting hosted by Brian on October 22. Thanks for the post-birthday hosting man! Poured from a 750 mL bottle, thanks to Mickey! The pour is great. Its a murky dark brown, hints of ruby and garnet trying to come through. There is a larger frothy tan head that leaves a great lace as it recedes to a collar and light film. The aroma is dominated with sweet caramel, dark fruits, and a strong vanilla character. There is plenty of oak, and a nice bourbon hidden. The sweet brandy comes through heavily, and it might be a little too sweet for me on the nose. Sweet wood. Not sure they wanted it to be this strong. The flavor is fantastic! There is a sweetness to it, but it works well with caramel, light roast, dark fruits, and the bourbon heat, which is a little more apparent than in the nose. The brandy is beautiful, and offers a lighter fruit to add to the complexity. The mouth feel is thick and chewy with a soft carbonation that adds to the viscosity and makes this thing beautiful! The aftertaste is lingeringly sweet and boozy, which is a great end. I was surprised at how good this is.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3646,"2015-05-21",4.4,"Everything I expected this to be; heavy-handed and unique barrel notes of both Brandy and Bourbon. I actually found the booze to be more harsh right at it was freshly opened, but as the carbonation settled the second and third pours were silky and oily on the palate, with considerable less alcohol soak. The body is full of deep caramel, toffee, and vanilla notes and it definitely drinks heavy for 11%. This is just a beautiful beer and the flavors are tight and distinct. This will age very well.","Hyde Park, Massachusetts, USA","ElDuderino"

The sweet taste of brandy and rich caramel pops up first, followed by smooth bourbon that provides a balanced booze heat. Tannins, a metallic copper touch and a slightly astringent woody bite at the end round out the flavor. Sticky texture. Another great barrel-aged AleSmith brew.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
