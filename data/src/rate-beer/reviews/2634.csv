2634,"2014-10-06",2.7,"0,5 l bottle. A dark golden in the glass, clear of course and a big white foamy head. Clove, yeast and chewing gum on the nose. Starts more fuity like apple with yeast, followed by a flat cardboard sequence and wheat. Again hints of fruits with banana in the aftertaste. A lot of taste for a Kristall.
