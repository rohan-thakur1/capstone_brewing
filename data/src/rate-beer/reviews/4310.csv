Taste has got some sharp hop notes, fading quickly into a dry malt texture. Palate is mild, carbonated, and light. Overall, decent for a hells but nothing to write home about.

4310,"2017-05-14",3.0,"Solid helles. Mix pack fodder. Crisp bitter finish on a pale malt body. Had that helles type yeast presence. Not bad.","Georgia, USA","rdixon77"
4310,"2017-05-13",3.3,"From the 12 fl. oz. bottle with an expiration date of September 2017. Yellow, bubbly and carbonated pour building up to a long-lasting white foamy head that laces as it fades. Not a whole lot to the aroma. It has some toasted biscuit and bread and maybe a grassy hop presence. The body is light but fairly smooth. The taste has the same toasted sweetness with a kind of rustic, herbal quality that kicks in toward the end. Yeah, I dont think I will drink this that often.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"

4310,"2017-05-04",3.7,"Aroma is earthy/grainy malts and fruit/citrus/sugar. The flavor is fruit/citrus, malts, hops and a bitter finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
4310,"2017-05-04",3.5,"Respectable take on a no-frills style, giving up moderate toasted grain and grassy sweetness on top of firm, floral Noble hops. Modest lager esters add a bit of depth, and a salty/bready note in the finish complements the mildly bitter fade. Pour is absolutely beautiful, and the texture feels about right for summer beer. Nose is lacking, but otherwise weve got a perfectly acceptable lager.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"
