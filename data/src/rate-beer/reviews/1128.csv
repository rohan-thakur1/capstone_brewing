Po kilku dobrych minutach ≈º√≥≈Çtawy puch spada na d√≥≈Ç do p√≥≈Çmilimetrowego ko≈Çnierza.

1128,"2017-05-14",4.1,"Besteld en op 7-10-2016 afgehaald bij ""mijnkadodoos.be"" in Bornem. Fles nummer 268. Geproefd op 6-5-2017. Rodenbach Alexander is een rood-bruin en helder biertje dat bij het uitschenken een normale hoeveelheid beige-kleurig schuim geeft, dit heeft een gelijkmatige structuur en blijft sterk aan het glas kleven. Het slaat wel vlug neer tot een zeer dun gelijkmatig laagje. Toch kan je een middelmatige CO2 verzadiging zien van belletjes met een middelmatige grootte. Het aroma is zurig, mischien zelfs melkzurig. Zoetig ook met een hint naar suiker, fruitig met vooral kers, verder kruidig met een vage hint van amandel en wat hout-toetsen. De smaak is wel zeer zoet en wat zurig, weerom het melkzure, het zoete met suiker en een fruitige tint, zelfs een lichte moutbitterheid en ook fruitigheid van de kersen. In de mond geeft Rodenbach Alexander een volle smaak en heeft hij een volmondig textuur en met een normale prikkeling is dit wel een harmonieus en lekker biertje. De nasmaak vloeit weinig uit, is zoet en wat zurig. Ondanks het tamelijk sterke zoete is deze Rodenbach Alexander toch in balans met het zure, de kersen steken er wel bovenuit maar dit mag geen beletsel zijn om dit lekkere en laag alcoholisch aperitiefbier te degusteren.","Dendermonde, BELGIUM","RudiGR"

1128,"2017-01-27",4.0,"750 ml corked bottle at abv 5.6%, opened with fairly loud ¬ëpop¬í bought at HK Brewcraft in Central.
Looks: Clear ruby red colour; Half finger head with soapy off-white foam which fades in 30 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with fizzy, very slight carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant red malt, with strong sour cherries, strong red vinegar, red wine, grape skins, apple cider, sugar, and strong tannin. Not overpowering but rich with every sniff. Nice!

Taste: Sour and sweet red malt, with very fruity sour cherries, strong tartness, yoghurt, red vinegar, lactic acid, red wine, funk, strong oak barrels, sugar, strong tannic and grass.

Body: Medium body. Very slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Rich red maltyness in a slightly watery background. Very slick and smooth. Massive sour cherries is everywhere, very fruity and lively which brings up the red wine and malt vinegar. Barnyard is notable but not as strong as some Sour Reds, Medium sweetness which balances the tartness just fine. Notable oak barrels with strong tannin to round. Everything is just about right and really tasty!

Hoppiness: No nose, just grass in taste; Bitterness is quite strong tannin for an abrupt, nice sweet and sour malty finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry; Fruity, winey and nicely astringent to mouth.

Comments: I can see why this one is so popular - the sour cherries is the main driver behinds this solid sour red base.

1128,"2016-10-18",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 31, 2016 Very classic Belgian fruit beer, ¬íoud bruin¬í with cherries, in the same tradition as Liefmans Kriekbier (now called Liefmans Kriek Brut) or Verhaeghe Echt Kriekenbier. I have regretted for many years having had the chance to taste this back in the nineties, but having declined because I was not as experienced in beer tasting as I am now and did not care too much for fruit beers - ah, the callowness of youth! Luckily, Palm (now Bavaria-owned), after having received questions from consumers about this for years, has decided to bring it back to life this year, thirty years after it was first launched in honour of the (literally) blind Alexander Rodenbach, a 19th-century politician and brewer (two things that were often linked to each other in those days), and sixteen years after it was put to retirement. Much to the discontent of Belgian consumers, it was first released on the American market (it says a lot that even the family brewers are aware of the fact that the Americans have become more eager for more characterful craft beers than their local audience, but anyway); again after many reactions from Belgian beer lovers, it was finally decided to launch it onto the Belgian market as well. This rating concerns the 155th bottle in that first launch, a luxury 75 bottle from a cardboard box, corked with muselet and white background colour with a picture of the historical figure after which it was named - one thing it has in common with the original bottles from the eighties and nineties. Opens with quite a lot of pressure and smoke coming out of the bottle neck, but there is no gushing. Medium sized, pale yellowish beige-ish head, moussy and stable, leaving a thin veil of the liquid¬ís surface after a while; warm copper brownish-red robe, beautifully ¬íautumny¬í for this time of year, clear initially, with a lively, lambrusco-like fizz. Aroma does breathe cherry juice and cherry jam, but also an unexpected (and for me undesirable) hint of red candy (¬ípoepegatjes¬í), though this is fortunately largely drenched in caramel, sweet sherry, red wine vinegar, redcurrant, some wet wood, cherry pits, vanilla, passion fruit, ros√© wine, apple peel, honey, ripe gooseberry. The red candy sweetness is present in the onset too, again that reminiscence of ¬íHaribo red licorice wheels¬í or something like that, but much to my relief, it doesn¬ít stick around for too long or dominate the entire palate, as is often the case in more artificial red fruit beers; instead, it quickly makes room for a deeper and more convincing flavor of indeed cherries, but also rhubarb, gooseberry, passion fruit and cranberries, adding a deeper fruit acidity to the whole without losing contact with the sweetness; carbonation is fizzy but in a pleasantly refined way, as in some fine red lambrusco. Mouthfeel is smooth and supple, with a lean caramelly and lightly honeyish malt sweet core, of the ¬ímoelleux¬í kind I think is essential in a Flemish red style beer; meanwhile the drying fruit tartness continues and penetrates the palate in a gently drying way, eventually blending with tannins from wood and cherry pits, providing balance against the malt sweetness and that initial red candy sweet touch. Some earthy, estery yeastiness is left in the back of the mouth after swallowing (especially near the end of the bottle, of course), along with that drying tartness. I can still feel a light stickiness of the red candy and that is basically my only point of criticism here: I do not know exactly how this was made (I only know the recipe of the original version), but I am convinced that this is not just old Rodenbach with sour cherries added: this is very clearly sugared as well, and in that sense offers a look back at the eighties, when this beer was conceived because many consumers - having grown up as a ¬íCoca Cola¬í generation - added grenadine or sugar to their Rodenbach anyway and the brewery wanted to find a way to counter this and already add that flavor to the beer itself. I have managed to find a vintage bottle of 1998 as well and I am extremely curious to find out if this original, historical version too had this added sugariness to it, though after almost twenty years, it will doubtlessly have evolved too much to establish that in an unambiguous way, I suspect. I will add my findings of that vintage bottle here too when I open it but for now: great beer for sure, Rodenbach ¬íoud bruin¬í in all respects, glad it¬ís back - and probably for sale in supermarkets here within a year or so; in my unbiased opinion (unbiased since I never had this Alexander when I was young), however, Charact√®re Rouge tops this in authenticity, finesse and complexity - at least the first batch, because from what I have heard, they appear to use syrup in that one too now that it is made in large quantities (time for a re-rate...).","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

There is a lot of cherry right up front. It does have quite a bit of funk and oak on the nose, but for the most part, it¬ís really good. The flavor is a little better. It¬ís got a tartness to it, and then a sweet cherry, like a pie filling, just coating the mouth and lingering. The oak and funk seem to fade, leaving the beautiful cherry behind. The mouth feel is a little thicker and slightly syrupy with a nice carbonation and a lingeringly sweet and tart cherry.

Aroma / Appearance - Cherry red liquid licorice fills the glass with a warm glow. Velvety cream cheese colored head radiates calm. Tart cherries and malt elevate Rodenbach to a new level that is more mellow than the Grand Cru I remember.

Flavor / Palate - Cherry pie filling, sweet custard, and tart fruits burst onto the scene. The flavor lingers in every corner of the throat for minutes after each sip.

Overall, a great beer.Earlier Rating: 1/21/2013 Total Score: 5(Bottle 1986 first year) Have had this on a number of occasions. Each time it seems to get even better. Top 10 all time beer for me. Most recently served in a Rodenbach Alexander Glass.Pours a nice garnet color with an off white head. Nose is really, really nice with cherry, sherry, balsamic vinegar, and a bit of oaky earth. Taste is definite sour cherry, acetic acid, balsamic, oak, and some light fruitiness. Mouthfeel is quite creamy with good acidity. I am fortunate to have 24 cases of this beer in my cellar.","","ianhuntley73"

1128,"2016-05-20",4.5,"Draft and bottles. All-around gorgeous. Not nearly as tart as expected, much rounder with a complex sweetness - dried fruit, a balanced oakiness, some drier dessert wine vibes, a little biological-style funk.

1128,"2016-05-02",4.6,"Dark Woody oaky sour cherry Apple aroma. Flavor is the same. Very complex and balanced. Not too sour and super fruity from the wood. Apple fruity comes through more than other rodenbach. Full flavored, balanced and just great. Sour maybe 4 or 5 of 10. Not super sour but just all around well balanced and awesome. Note: Had at Edmunds Oast, was told this has not been brewed for 16 years.  Assuming this is the 2016 version with that info. 5.6% ABV

Intense ruby red beer like fine jewelry. Nose is cherry and some wood notes. Tastes of cherry, raspberry, balsamic, woody, and fairly tart. Like a fruit lambic. Finishes very bright fruits.

1128,"2015-12-05",4.3,"(250ml 1998 bottle @ DHVL, Liedekerke, Nov 16 2015, split w/ phyllomedusa) Pours clear deep mahogany copper with a big lasting head of whitish froth lingering with loads of lace. Aroma of raisins, caramel, sweet/tart cherries, dark bread, hard cheese, touch musty. On the palate, sweet burnt sugar, sweet cherry, currants, touch of acid light enough that it could be anything - lacto/pedio or aceto, just balances it out. A hint of cardboard oxidation creeps in the middle. Some grain and light oak, dry hay, soft cheese. A bit of bitterness in the finish, like old hops and baseboard. Medium full body, slick, very soft carbonation. Really lovely stuff despite the age on it, a bit sweet and a bit sour but far from bracing, oxidation kept well in check still.

1128,"2015-02-17",3.9,"11.2 oz bottle acquired via trade with ClarkVV. Thanks, Clark! Rating #6000. Pours a healthy deep ruby auburn hue, faint haze but near transparent as a healthy carmelized cherry glow tinges the body and edges. Frothy offwhite head atop stays as a mellow filmy layer, decent ringer atop stays small but laces well enough. Healthy colors are deep alluring, fiery copper, flashes of cherry and ruby cut through and catch the eye. Aromas show distinct sour cherries, jabs of tannic oak, cherry skin and some flashes of red wine. A touch of biscuit, lactic acidity is mellow but appealing. A nice sourness, faint leather, sour chrerries and stone fruit. A bit of balsamic, more red wine and some jabs of vinegar give some life on the nose. A bit of biscuit, faint spice and carmelized malts peek through with some gentle oxidation. Initial is a more mellow body overall, a bit more mellowed out than the nose shows. Some cherry pulp, gentle metallic twang and lactic slash. Touches of red wine, stone fruit and a bit of berry meet some gentle oak. A bit more tannic, a touch toasty and oxidized into the backend. Some wet paper, biscuits with touches of balsamic, leather and tannic cherry backwards. A bit of sweetness, spice and lactic twang as we trail out. Firmer oak, a bit of toast and lingering jab of balsamic and oaky life. While the nose pops here and seems to give some healthy nods to the good old days, the beer itself ends up just a touch faded into the backend. Some decent lactic pop, touches of muted and aging malts. Some healthy barrel and terroir with some nice sour pop and nuance up front. Good cherry, sourness and depth trailing back into some firmer oak, fuzzy lactic twang, touches of leather and earth with lingering pokes of red wine, a biscuity malt presence touches of age. Really, letting this breathe and warm a bit really picks up a lot more red fruit, lush cherries and touches of seedy raspberry. That touch of age on the backend and finish rears it head every now and then, reminding you of what this used to be but still how good it is all things considered. Pretty surprised at it¬ís hold up. That bit of dryness and oaky tannic feel hanging on and slowly letting go as we trail out through the finish. Overall a really great nose and appearance still has flashes of greatness at times through it¬ís flavor profile. A bit muted and faded overall with some elegant struts at times. A decent flow with some oxidation and dry tannic elements favoring the backend and finish. A really good beer that I bet sparkled at one point and still holds up against most sours I¬íve come across, nuanced and delicate punching only when it needs to. An honor to try. Cheers.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

The beer pours out a beautiful purple/brown bruise like of a color (almost looking like a light grape soda) with basically nearly zero head. Aroma is really something wonderful. Strong notes of wet wood, sweet vermouth/sherry, light barnyard/funk, and something that seemed reminiscent of red wine vinegar?? 

The flavor starts out with a strong cherry/port like sweetness but it quickly balanced by an even tartness, layers of vanilla/oak/earth and caramel chews. It really is complex and far removed (IMO) from what the original beer must have tasted like fresh.

1128,"2012-10-14",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2016 Rating # 500. Small pour from a bottle (best before 1996) generously shared by David M., huge thanks  for giving me the opportunity to try this one! Clear reddish brown with a small lacing. About 20 years old and still well carbonated. Intense raspberries aroma with other red fruits, some sweetness and slight sourness. Not overly complex but perfectly balanced. Taste is sweet with red fruits and slight sourness (far less than what I expected though). The red fruits of the aroma and of the taste are completely different (same fruits - mostly raspberries and cherry - but different effect ), the aroma is more like fresh fruits (even after 20 years) and the flavor is more syrupy. Mouthfeel is syrupy. Almost no sign of oxidation. I don¬ít think the beer could benefit from more aging, it may be a little on the decline, but it¬ís still a wonder.

The beer is chestnut brown with a touch of crimson, sporting a thin beige collar that leaves some random lacing on the tulip.

The aroma offers a healthy dose of cherries, cherry juice, a bit of oak. Definitely smells like a Rodenbach.

The flavor is a lovely mix of sweet and tart, with cherries shining through beautifully. Age has served this beer well. Mild on the palate and silky smooth. Like drinking fresh cherry juice. It¬ís hard to believe the beer is as old as it is, as it tastes fresh and fruit forward.

1128,"2012-07-24",4.9,"25cl bottle poured into namesake snifter. Vintage: 1998. Enjoyed at DHvL in early June 2012. Medium burgundy. Single (khakis) fingernail head on gentle pour. Smell is mix of dark cherry, tannins, and oak. Not much else here, but very deep. Nose is quite inviting. WOW - this beer tastes absolutely beautiful! Combination of cherry and oak. Touch of apple with hidden notes of faint vanilla too. Balance of sweet and sour is well executed and this beer is holding up quite well for being well older than a decade. Soft, smooth, and refreshing. Superb! A thoroughly enjoyable beer! Very well-rounded and has withstood the age of time. A beautiful beer that I would highly recommend to anyone. Simply amazing! Wish I could drink this more often.","5280, Colorado, USA","spdyfire83"

Some tones of cellar time of course but not nearly as much as expected in the aroma. Flavor however reveals more dusty notes with less fresh fruityness, still oak mixes with cherry leading to a long balanced finish with sweet and sour goodness typical of any aged Rodenbach. Light ultra slick body makes for an easy yet complex drinking experience.","Malm√∂, SWEDEN","andersand"

Perfectly aged. Wonderful. This is one beer I did not want to end!

2016 version: 8/4/7/4/15=3.8. Very fruity and also very, very sweet. Jammy cherries, just a bit of vinegar and yogurt, vanilla.

1128,"2011-07-23",4.3,"Bottle acquired in a trade with GG (thanks!) a while back enjoyed out of my Rodenbach Alexander snifter.  Pour is deep brownish purple with pretty much no head.  Looks to be still at this point.  Aroma is deep and earthy with notes of tart fruity sweetness and a deeper layer of rich candy sugar and caramel malt.  Flavor is different than expected and really very intriguing.  Not as tart as expected and not quite still- notes of carbonation do tingle on tongue as i sip the beer. Loads of deep earthy rich cereal malt and a light cherry sweetness are first to hit.  Faint hints of sourness do exist, but they are in the periphery.  Also a light prune note with hints of malt vinegar without the sharp acidity. There are also light notes of wood and a faint hint of oxidation present.  Really glad to have had the opportunity to try this one with my wife.  Very interesting beer to be sure.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"

Sweet flavor, heavy malt obscures any acid, cherries strong, light tea and paper, thin chocolate, bit of sugars.

1128,"2011-04-06",4.4,"Finally cracked this bottle that I received in a trade with thewolf well over a year ago. Thanks again! It pours reddish gold with nothing but a few spare bubbles. Very clear and bright looking. The aroma hits you first with notes of vinegar followed by a lovely combination of sweet cherry cough syrup, vanilla, and slight cocoa. The flavor is unlike any other sour that I¬íve had. Perfectly balanced between sweet and sour, the cherry flavors really come forward with noticeable hints of vanilla and some richness that I can only describe as distantly ""chocolaty"". The body is very smooth and rich which belies the 6% ABV. It¬ís really amazing how well the sourness has held up over time, although I¬ím not sure how old the bottle is. Not funky at all, just pure liquid gold with great balance of flavors. I¬ím sad that I¬íll probably never get to try this one again!","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
1128,"2011-03-30",4.5,"2 bottles consumed for our bachelor party whale tasting. My bottle was imported and Sean¬ís was straight from Belgium. No year listed on either, but they were clearly different. I am reviewing my bottle as I favored it. Sean¬ís bottle had a slightly better nose but my bottle was more balanced in taste...A dark brown with amber accents, semi clear. The head is light tan, light, looks oily, like an spoil on the surface of the beer...A strong aroma with a nice super strong cherry base, malty vinegar comes through but a little lighter than I was hoping. The cherries have held up great, strong, complex, full of depth...The taste is a great balance, a continuation of the sweet and flavorful cherries with a great vinegar tartness, almost 50/50 split. Take a Rodenbach Grand Cru, add cherries, age it and you have this wonderful beer.

Red wine vinegar, oak, deeply rich malt.  Sweet cherries and oak unfold.  Really strange, lovely progression.  Endlessly complex.  Deep, earthy, and a bit herbal.  Almost hard to take the intensity of this.  Perfectly bubbly, fine carbonation, sharp enough but soft enough.

Aroma starts out in a less than positive way, with an almost wood stain aroma, but fortunately starts to settle out with some air.  Regardless, there are a lot of nice notes of oak, fruit, and port, but stay mostly hidden behind the less appealing aroma.  The flavor on the other hand is stellar, and very surprising considering the nose, with lots of oak, vanilla, and robust dark fruits; nicely sour and tart.  Drinks much, much younger than the aroma alludes, which saves this one from being out and out over the hill.

1128,"2009-12-16",3.9,"25 cl bottle graciously shared by mreusch. July 1991 notched on the label. This beer has been my #1 most sought after beer on my want list for several years, so I approach it with quite a bit of expectation.  Pour is clear ruby orange with a minimal tan head that fades fast to just a few bubbles lining the glass. Pretty viscous on the swirl. Aroma on the initial pour is straight tawny port, syrupy, vinegar and acetic. Not traditional oxidation, but certainly smells a bit old. I think we need to let this one open up a bit. After 15 minutes or so, the initial aromas clear a bit, revealing some very faint cherry fruit and oak woodiness. Taste is very unexpected after the nose, in that it does not taste over the hill at all. Big dark black cherry and gentle oak woodiness. Nice sweet vanilla notes, layered in with the fruit and wood.  The vinegar and acidity of the nose is present, but mostly is a background flavor that accents and brightens up the fruit and wood.  Great complexity, really rich and full flavors. Palate is medium, pretty much still body. After taste is tart and acetic vinegar sourness - drying. Really nice.  For a beer that I had been wanting for so long, I had surprisingly few preconceived notions on the beer.  All in all, it was a fantastic experience and really had amazing vibrancy for an 18 year old beer.  Wow, Matt.  Just wow.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

It looks quite mellowed and still; expected with 10+ years of age since Palm stopped brewing this. The aroma is loaded with oak wood and tart, acidic cherry. Notes of potpourri, cinnamon bread, sherry wine, banana rum and lightly bittered toffee follow. The flavor is really something to appreciate here. Ultra-subtle transitions give way to sweet berry and dark grapes with cherry jam and old musty oak wood. The flavor‚Äôs finish is very earthy with lingering yeast and raisin bread character.

1128,"2008-07-06",3.9,"Poured from a 33 cl bottle.  Basic clear red and a wispy white film.  Huge aroma of musty cherry tobacco, maraschino cherry, champagne vinegar and vinaigrette.  It has a thick, woody, sweet-saltiness reminiscent of balsamic-seared onions and soy sauce.  Maple-thickened butter.

Flavor is Goudenband with intent to kill.  Brown sugar, cherry pie filling, vanilla-oak, raspberries, honey, and caramelized sugar; there¬ís passing winks of tartness, but no intense sourness or acidity.  Rather it¬ís a very well defined and polished sweet body of flavor, not bashful and somewhat confronting in its own way; it just isn¬ít in line with the expectation it produces.  Saturated in dark sweetness and a bit of ground pistachio and honey tang.  Alternately, there¬ís plenty of wine-like tartness, in a reisling-like shimmer of sugary simplicity.

Round, rotund palate is softly carbonated; finishes warmly with the same pungent, dark, slightly salty sweetness, and a wink of cherry and pineapple.  As an extraordinarily simple example, its single dimension has developed quite appreciably over the years, and it¬ís become very easy to like.

Pours a dark ruby hued brown color with a small cremay off white head. Nose is tart, raspberries, cherries, vinegar, butter, vanilla, with sweet undertones.  Mouth feel like is light to medium body, silky, velvety smooth. Carbonation is slight and almost airy. Initial taste of ever so gentle tart raspberries creeping up which get splashed and turned of sweet caramel.  Cherries become more apparent with some citrus lemon in the background. At first the acidity appears to be low, but the acidity is abolutely perfect. It¬ís so well balanced with the sweet notes that counter play.  Mid palate displays some herbal notes possibly freshed brew tea.  Oak is definitely present but in a mild manner. Finishing vinously, touch  of cocoa,  lemon rhine, raspberry and cherries continuing on the palate. Palate duration is above average. Head retention is decent with side swipes of lacing across the glass. Absolutely perfectly balanced, delicate and delicous. Unsure on the date on this one, I would love to find out.

1128,"2008-06-25",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 1, 2008 Finally got a chance to meet up w/ Styles for a few beers. Keep in mind I¬íve only met Chris a few weeks ago. Started out w/ a Signature Ale which is a pretty nice beer. What does Chris bring out next¬Ö.a frickin Alexander. Holy Shit I¬íve wanted this beer for so long and I never thought I¬íd get to try it. I¬íve thought about trading for it, but I didn¬ít want to give up half the cellar. 

I should have written down a rating when I was drinking it, but I¬íll try to remember all the nuances (might be a little tough after all the beers me, Chris, ryan, and Pailhead had at our little tasting). 

It pours quite nicely in the La Fin tulip. It¬ís brown w/ some orange and red around the edges. There¬ís a thin white head that slowly fades as I sip on this beauty¬Ö¬Ölooks better than I¬íd expect for a 10+ year old beer.

Damn, what a nose on this one. Reminds me of a toned down Grand Cru w/ some sweet and sour cherry notes. Maybe a touch of tobacco too.

This tastes even better than it smells. The cherries hit you right from the first sip. This is followed by a nice tartness and a few different spices. 

It¬ís a little thin, but that¬ís to be expected for a 10 year old beer. The flavors hang around on the palate for quite a while.

I am so glad I got to try this beer. I continue to be amazed by the generosity of the beer community. I actually like to Redbach, but that doesn¬ít even come close to this one. We can only hope Rodenbach starts brewing this again.  It¬ís just too good a beer to stay retired. Hopefully you get a chance to try this beauty¬Ö.I¬ím sure grateful I did.

The aroma was sour lemons with some cherries and bread crust. The taste was initially tart cherries with some light pancake syrup notes. There was also a little bit of caramel as this began to get sweeter. This is definitely a desert beer and best sampled in smaller quantities. I prefer the Grand Cru as it is more sour.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

Smells quite a bit like the regular Grand Cru--not as sour though, and a bit of a syrupy sweetness.  The sourness consists of lemony notes and light funky leather, and dry oak.  Flavor is still fairly tart with some lemony notes and the leathery funk.  A little bit sweeter than the aroma.  I think this is a little past its prime as some paper oxidation is present.  Dry oaky finish--bitterness peaked around a 2.  Medium body with light carbonation.

Bottle from the excellent tetrik. I¬íve wanted to try this beauty ever since the day that I joined the site. I started it out at refrigerator temperature. It pours a gorgeous red that flashes ruby as the sun shines through it, no head but the sunlight illuminates each of a thousand tiny bubbles rising in the liquid and all glowing yellow from within the crimson heart of the beer. From an oblique angle the orange-brown caramel tones emerge along the surface; complex and beautiful.

Big complex woody nose: tons of oak, sweet cherry juice, balsamic, hints of warm caramel, sherry, just a faint and very pleasant hint of musty stone-lined cellar. With the flavor, there¬ís so much going on in every sip. Of course the sourness, lemon juice over green apple, but it¬ís very restrained, one immediately picks up the sweet cherry juice again, all natural cherries, not syrup, but surprisingly sweet with caramels coming through to join the fruit. Funky Flemish sour flavors, recalling Duchess, but ever so much better integrated into the whole of the beer. Splendid dry/tart turn of tannic wood and cherry pits on the late end balances out the lingers sweet and sour leaving the palate overwhelmed with breadth of flavor. The mouthfeel is really nice, not too sticky but plenty full, not bubbling but with enough micro-bubble carbonation to keep it lively.

I¬ím incredibly lucky to have tried this beer. Thanks, tetrik. I owe you one. 9/5/9/5/18=4.6

Resurrected version, draft at Bottleworks 9/29/16.
Red pour, of course, into a small snifter. Cherry and oak aroma, some tart balsamic notes. Bright cherry in the flavor atop a Rodenbach-style flemish sour. Pie, some oak, only minor elements of what seem to me in all Flemish reds to be off-flavors but probably aren¬ít. Very tasty. 
Now, it¬ís not a 4.6 to be sure. I¬íd go about 8/4/8/4/16=4.0 for what I had today. Why the difference? There are a number of possibilities here. The first and most likely is that I was tasting the .rar in the original. The second is that the beers are different. The third is that the extreme age of the first bottle (acquired a number of years after the beer was retired) actually improved it. There¬ís no way we¬íll ever know.  What I do know is that I still have very fond memories of sitting in the study of the old house, opening this and entering my rating as I enjoyed it. Those memories are as permanent as they are good. That¬ís the nature of beer. 
tl;dr summary:Excellent cherry Flemish sour will never taste as rare as it did in 2008.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Intriguing aroma, soft rounded cherries have a bite to them, very slight medicinal note, fruity, sweet muted malt. 7+ Flavour is softly fruity, cherry ntoes like a black cherry or a choke cherry that grabs at the throat in the finish, sweet malt base has a nuance to it that I appreciate but can not name. Muted sugary notes. 7+ Average palate is very softly carbonated. Enjoyable. My notes seem quite favourable but at the time I was thinking that it was not nearly as good as the previous bottle I had here a few years ago. 7/4/7/3/15 - 3.5 1998 Vintage bottle at DHVL, Liedekerke
2008-03-06. Ruby tinged brown body with a decent bubbly beige head that fades a bit (3+). Aroma of increasingly sweet cherries, brief tart cherries, evolves into a musty fruit character accented by malt. (7+) Flavour is largely cherries, sweet with fluctuating degrees of sour accents ranging from light to medium. (7+) Average palate feels lighter but also smoother because of the light carbonation - it floats across the tongue delicately. (3+) Very nice. I enjoyed this much better than the Rodenbach Grand Cru, I found it much smoother and well rounded. +1 or 2 overall simply for the experience of a 16 year old beer that has held up remarkably well. 7/3/8/3/17 - 3.8 1992 Vintage.

I found with some research that it wasn¬ít produced since 1999 when the brewery was bought by Palm in 1998.   I think it was brewed in these huge 5000 gallon wooden barrels with extremely low oxygen absorption rates:  http://www.babblebelt.com/newboard/brew_resource/R  These large wooden barrels are increasing rare, but still used for great beers, such as La Folie, which is rumored to made by one of Rodenbach¬ís past brewers.

The Alexander is supposed to be a blend of Grand Cru and Cherry juice. http://www.sallys-place.com/beverages/beer/red_bee />
Very nice lactic sweet cherry aroma.  Great mouthfeel.  Thick, a bit syrupy, with a little bit of a slick mouthfeel, possibly from lactic acid?  Amber color.  Very easy to drink.  Kind of caramel sweetness I associate with aged barleywines, which makes me wonder if the high quality of this beer is partly due to the aging. Clings and coats the glass as I swirl.  Some carbonation, but a beer of this magnitude needs none.  Heavenly.  I could drink this everyday.  I¬ím tempted to give it a perfect 5.

1128,"2007-11-12",4.2,"So here it is rating # 800, I got something very special and I would not have been able to try it if it was not for BigErn, again many thanks. It¬ís the regular 11.2 oz bottle, no date.  It pours sort of dead with just a tiny bit of white lacing.  The color is dark burgundy red with lighter tints at the bottom of the glass and no clarity otherwise.  Aroma is cherry balsamic vinegar but the balsamic is not too strong.  It¬ís lightly sour and not really showing much age outside of maybe a reduction in the sourness (but I really cannot tell what it used to smell like anyway).  Taste starts off sweet cherry syrup then leads to light balsamic vinegar and faint cocoa before a nice short burst of acidity and sourness that quickly runs away and leaves a lightly dry sour cherry aftertaste.  The taste is actually extremely nice once I realize this probably was never meant to be a sour assault on the palate a la the more modern Flanders Reds.  It¬ís actually quite comfortable in providing enough of the sourness but then quickly taking it away from the drinker.  At first I was a little disappointed but then I realized this beer is going for something else.  After the first sip I was like, aww, it¬ís not bad but it¬ís not earth shattering.  But after a few more, as I type, my mouth waters for more beer as this long-lasting cherry stays and the palate is so dried out from the burst of sourness at the end of the flavor.  The mouthfeel is a bit sticky which adds to the medium body which creates a very felt beer.  The carbonation is actual right around average.  Can¬ít tell whether I have convinced myself that this is that good or it really is that good.  I even broke out the Rodenbach Grand Cru tulip glass for this, actually I bought this glass with the purpose of using it to drink this beer.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Pours a vinous, multi-layered black cherry red with a spritzy, small bubbled off white head that holds an inch thick. Beaiutiful to look at, especially under the light. Nose has a lot of oak, vinegar, and cherries, and blended together exceptionally well. Could sniff this one for hours, i think i say that a lot, but its true. Flavor is sharp and acidic with more vinegar notes, but this is all very well balanced with the cherries and malt sweetness. Cherry and Raspberry vinegar lingers in the finish.  This is wonderfully tart and sour and just what I needed tonight. Drank this overt the course of about an hour and a half and I think it got better with every sip, especially as it warmed.

1128,"2007-08-26",4.3,"Big thanks to Springslicker for sharing this. It looks a bit like iced tea. Aroma is winey, even a bit sugary, and only mildly fruity. Very tart, with some earthy, leathery undertones. Maybe even a touch of champagne. Very tasty, insanely drinkable. They should make this again.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
1128,"2007-08-26",4.1,"Bottle, split with SpringsLicker, Suttree, and decaturstevo. Pours a dark amber with some whitish head (and quite a bit of cloudiness since I got the bottom of the bottle). The aroma is bread with raisin, cherry, and a healthy dose of sourness. The flavor has a good sour bite to it, but in a smooth way if that makes sense. It is bready with orange and cherry notes throughout. The finish is dry, toasty, and still a bit sour. Very refreshing. Excellent beer.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

1128,"2007-08-09",4.4,"Rating #300. 33cl bottle via trade with Goldtwins, Shared by WeeHeavySD. When i first tried the Grand Cru,  I loved it, but was dispointed I¬íd never get to try Alexander. Thank you Jon for the chance. Redish brown with a small tan head. Sweet complex nose with underlying sour notes. Flavor is tart and acidic, not quite ripe plum and cherry with some slightly citric notes.the Vingear flavor is not as strong as in the Grand Cru, but still there. leaves a lingering flavor in the mouth.

A lot more muted than the more crazy grand cru.  Pretty damn tasty.  Damn really nice beer.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
1128,"2007-08-07",4.3,"Rating #1000. Bottle from Styles. I wanted this beer to be mind-blowing, and I wanted to write a review of it likening it to a roller-coaster... where all the beers leading up to this were the endless climb up to the top of the first hill. Where the cap is popped and I am just bridging the hump. The first sniff is taken and it all comes into speed, as I fly along the track and am taken for a wild, intense, amazing ride that is done before I know it. And then that is it. Back to the grind, back to the baby steps in between the adrenaline rushes, the hours of waiting between each 2 minute adventure. 

But I am not going to write a review like that. Because this isn¬ít quite that good. Is it great? Yes. Fantastic? Perhaps. But so good that I could dare write a review calling every other beer I have had up to this point just another step towards the pinnacle that is Rodenbach Alexander? Nope. Oh well! 

So here is my review:
Small white head.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
1128,"2007-07-30",4.2,"Rating #100!!!  Sampled many times over the years from Brussels to California...various vintages.  Copper color, beige head.  Cherry sweet tart and light vinegar aroma and taste, with notes of apricot, green apple candy, balsamic, and rich oak.  Sometimes bitter, funky and/or syrupy sweet, but always intriguing and compelling.  Most folks want more after one sip, just to reinforce the taste sensation that is unique and fun!  A classic that no one has reproduced, though the Duchesse de Bourgogne and others are somewhat similar.  Certainly a classic that while may be a tad past it¬ís prime, is a world class beauty.","LA, California, USA","DenverLogan"
1128,"2007-06-29",4.2,"12 oz bottle, via Styles I believe.  Pours a clear dark copper to amber with a reddish tinge under a one finger fizzy beige head that retained as a foamy covering.  The aroma is just mouthwatering.  Equal parts Flemish Sour and pure raspberry essence.  Reminds me of a raspberry eiswine.  Just a slight foreshadow of tartness.  Really great tart raspberry flavor.  Just like fresh picked off the bush.  How is that possible after this many years?  Tart slightly acetic bracing finish.  Lots of sweetness, but not cloying at all.  Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a nice drying acetic finish that kinda sucks the saliva out of your cheeks.  A world class beer.  A shame that they took it away.  Amazing to think that this is ""old"".","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
1128,"2007-06-24",4.2,"RATING #1000!  Almost three years in the making, I have finally achieved the coveted number.  And what a beer with which to mark my accomplishment.  This comes courtesty of Terry Boyd, and how fitting... the #1 beer guy in Connecticut handing me that which would become the showpiece for my most significant benchmark.  Terry got these bottles from a friend down south who didn¬ít know what it was... luckily for us.  Poured an effervescent light brownish red with a white head that started tight and creamy but became somewhat fizzy.  Interesting aroma of sundae cherries, cream, a bit of vinegar,  some cinnamon.  Almost artificial in its sweetness.  Flavor is very complex, with both sweet and tart balancing each other well.  Sundae and black cherries come through strongly with some cider vinegar, vanilla, a bit of oak, some olive-like character.  Almost dessert-like, but with enough unfolding layers to warrant solitary study.  Finishes with some ashen dryness and a bit of olive pit.  Very easy drinking.  This has obviously held up very well.  Very tasty.  I wonder why they stopped making this.Also, special thanks to the entire RateBeer community for taking me on an incredible journey through a world of such unfathomable depth that it confounds all except those most familiar with its terrain.  I know I still have many miles and glasses to go, and I¬ím looking forward to every one.  Cheers to all you great RateBeerians!","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

1128,"2007-04-28",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2008 Rerate, 33cL bottle, courtesy of ryan.  Thanks!!  Pours an oily, amber-brown color with golden edges; headless, although others got a slight bit of head formation in their pours.  Very dense and generous aroma: honey, red fruit leather, some toasty oak, with a sweet and sour character and mild tartness; a nice touch of acidity is noticeable.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: dense, chewy cherries, mildly tart citrus, balsamic, and toasty oak character; light acidity, a bit less than the previous bottle I tried; still impressively dense, gorgeous red fruit character, and just excellent, even with so much time behind it.  Lengthy finish: toasted malts and cereal, red fruits, and a touch of lingering acidity and tartness.

Rating #500.  33cL bottle, courtesy of BigErn.  Thanks a ton, Sean!!  Pours a clear, reddish-orange color, almost like a dark cherry wood; small off-white head with fine-bubbled lacing, hanging tight to the sides of the glass.  Rich, tart cherries and red fruits in the aroma; enormously sweet-and-sour, but keeps up with the tartness, allowing the sweet fruit and warm vanilla to poke through; hints of green olive.  Wonderful, generous nose.  Full, viscous mouthfeel: light carbonation and incredibly dense; layers of tart cherries and ripe dark fruits, maple syrup and chewy maltiness; medium acidity, giving a gentle bite on the sides of the tongue; doesn¬ít have the over-the-top acidity and tartness of something like DDSB20.  Lengthy, minutes-long finish, showing cherries and woody oak character.  Incredible. 9.4.10.5.19=4.7","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

1128,"2007-03-27",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2007 Rating is a culmination of notes from samples from vintages 1986, 87, 90, 91, 92, 93, 98, 99. All bottles(9 and 11oz) held up superbly, a testament to Rudy Ghequire¬ís expertise and a sophisticated recipe and bottling process. Dark, deep red pour with oily chestnut highlights. Tall cream colored head, slowly diminishing, never fully. Aroma is sour and sweet cherries, wet oaken barrel and refined glorious yeast. Also apricot rinds, apples, peaches, flowers and wax in unison, all in reserved quantities. Breathtaking. Flavor is once again solely focused on cherries, oak and yeast, and has very minor notes of funk, acidic fruits and sour grapes. Alcohol is never a noticeable factor. Finishes sweet with little acidity, cherry and sugar lingering. Palate is perfectly wrought and though syrupy at times, there is always enough sourness to dice through it. Every bottle was memorable, especially the last one, as I knew it would probably be the last ever. A tragedy this was discontinued, but hope glimmers that it will return one day.

Color was ruby red and extremely pleasant to look at. Aroma was very complex with notes of berries.

Well blended from years of age (I¬ím assuming) but still quite vibrant.

1128,"2006-11-23",4.4,"From a 330mL Bottle.  Pours a rich toasted hazelnut shell with a marvelous layer of ivory foam and a wonderful clarity.  Breathtaking aroma ripened cherries, strawaberrry flesh, and raspberry seeds waft from the glass, providing a succulent berry base to the tart bouquet.  Medium bodied, crisply carbonated mouthfeel.  The cherries keep rolling off of the tongue, providing a fabulously natural pectin sweetness to balance the tartness.  The fruits take the lead in this one, balanced by the perfect acidity.  So delcious.  As the fruits slowly fade from the palate, a subtle sour funkiness appears quietly on the tongue, accompanied by a glimpse of oaky dryness.  As this slowly fades, a softer version of the intial fruity characters reappear, leaving a lusciously smooth final smack.  Outstandingly complex palalte with exceptional fruit flavors overall.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
1128,"2006-11-23",4.9,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2013 Crisp saltine aroma, heavy on raspberry champagne vinegar. Very refined and tawny, edges of sherry. Many dripping cherry notes, with sweet crisp juices and dry pits. Very elegant and silky, but seems a little reserved and almost too straightforward (keeping it down 0.2 in the aroma). Flavor is damn near insanity. It¬ís pure lubricious delight of all kinds of cherries, schaarsbeekse, montmortenci, rainier and Door County. All sweet, bright and lucious and right in front of me. So unique and rich. A truly original coalescence of creative flourish and tangy delight. The sharpy sour notes are incredibly enlightening, with blending notes of astringent fire. The palate and finish could have had a little more moment, except that ti¬ís sweetness paris with the crisp cutting acidit to create nice balance and increasingly dry finish. Distant hop cone thoughts. The oak really brings some nice touches of vanilla cherry sugars. Overall, a true masterpiece and a crying shame that it¬ís no longer produced.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

1128,"2006-10-24",4.9,"UPDATED: OCT 23, 2007 Thanks to goldtwins for a bottle of this.  I live ina college town with no good beer bars, and as most of you would guess I do not enjoy ""chugging swill"" that they serve at the bars.  So what was my solution?  I smuggled a 1990 something (not sure of the vintage) bottle of this wonderful elixir into one of the crappiest little bars that only serve BMC.  Man was this beer awesome!  The aroma mostly a vinegar/balsmic vinegar with some cherries and a little oak...but it was kinda hard to tell since it was so smoking in the bar.  The flavor is what really did me in with this beer.  It was outstanding!  Most flemish sours I have had are a little too puckering sour, but this one was just perfect with a little touch of sour, some oak, lots of cherries and even a little grape juice flavor...maybe reminiscent of a good wine?  It was the perfect meld of sweet and sour without either one dominating the other.  This stuff was great.  My mouth was watering for another sip every time I finished taking a taste of it.

1128,"2006-09-10",4.8,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2007 When I entered De Heeren van Liedekercke, I knew what I wanted. I sat down with the beer list, to be polite, examined it rapidly noticing that the object of my desire was nowhere to be found, got up again, walked to the bar with a knowing air and asked if the Rodenbach Alexander was available. The barmaid, whom I later found out to be the co-owner Jessi, smiled and said she would check the cellar. She reappeared with a radiant expression carefully holding the lower neck of the bottle in one hand, and between the thumb and index of the other, a molted face of its label. Clasping my hands in assuagement, I returned to my seat and was delivered in its congruous wide-mouthed snifter, the beer, along with its bottle and the discarded part of its gold-trimmed label. The paper seemed to disintegrate with a mere poke, but barring the dust and cobwebs its colors were still vivid, 14 years after bottling.


Thick and crystalline, the liquid glowed of a cherry wood color carved like a gem in its orbicular glass. A thin layer of off-white cream produced burbling bubbles with fantastic adhesion. It takes one brief sniff to realize the grandeur of Rodenbach¬ís magnum opus. A single inhalation however, would be torture beyond the most painful methods. In a background of dusty garret scents, freshly baked cherry pie appears with a sweet eruption of toffee, brown sugar and cinnamon. The candy-like, almost Twizzleresque cherry aroma is sustained by a contrastingly natural sensation added to the slight twang of apple and oak. Further complexity emerges from the weathered ambience lent by dry Parmesan cheese and whole wheat bread. It takes a significant effort to properly appreciate such a heavenly aroma without succumbing to the temptation of absorbing it in one big gulp. Inevitably, I take a sip, and I¬ím beyond any utopia. The texture appears first in all its velvety glory, smooth, soft and sweet; the deflated carbonation renders this nectar above any avatar of beer while its sticky but dry cherry sourness coats the palate and mind assiduously, lingering even as I write this review weeks after the encounter. The wet sweetness of caramel and brown sugar is flawlessly balanced with the fruit and vanilla oak flavors. There¬ís a primal aspect about this beer that strikes me in its coalescing complexity, an unusually perfect equilibrium that retains genuine identity. This beer transcends all the others I¬íve had - why, oh why, did Rodenbach stop?","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"
1128,"2006-09-04",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 25, 2008 A Mes rate: 1998 25cl bottle from De Heeren Van Liedekerke.God how I love Rodenbach, God how amazing this beer is. Aroma is unbelievable. Can pick out the cherries and the sour ale seperately and quite clearly. There is just a hint of alcohol in there and dust plus some wooden notes. Obviously you can sense a bit of age in there but this has not suffered at all. Appearance is a real novelty. Like a slightly more translucent Rodenbach with a definite red/mahogany hue. The real novelty is the tan head. Most unusual on a beer that has such a strong cherry character. Head? Yes I kid you not. 8 years past its sell by date and it still has a glorious chunky head. Nice lace too. Another thing I was surprised by was the total lack of floaters. Sooooooo smooth in the mouth. Palate is unreal considering its age. I don¬ít recall this from the last time I had it but the cherries are clear as day. Not quite so tart and sour as Rodenbach but with just the right amount of funk. (I guess it would mellow a little with age anyway). Obvious cinnamon is there, in a Glukriek type way. None of the age is really that apparent in the flavour apart from a faint musky wooden character but it is no way as strong as I would have expected. So very very special. Finish is sublime. Just a quick hit of sour and then bitter and finally settling on fantastic dry cherries. I really can¬ít believe what outstanding condition this is in considering it is 8 years past it¬ís sell by. A very fitting 600th rate for us. I¬ím in heaven.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

1128,"2006-06-30",4.7,"1992 vintage, bottle into Rodenbach glass, Heeren van Liedekerke.  Crystal clear ruby amber with off-white dusting of a head that extends its dense lacing up the side.  Smell: is this a barley wine?  Sensuous aroma of brown sugar and plums soaking in port wine and chocolate sauce, mixed in with a bit of the warm alcohol and cherry I was expecting to smell.  The smell reminds me of Samichlaus too, in the chocolate and port elements.  This bodes well, friends.  The flavor: never has a beer had a more perfect warm cherry taste.  Even after 14 years, this tastes fresh, like I plucked a cherry from a tree in the Garden of Eden; it¬ís still sweet, though not as sweet as it would be if fresh in the real world; it¬ís tart, but not sour.  Everything in perfect balance, with sweetness and tartness only accents to the warmness of the fruit flavor itself.  Wonderful.  Tartness intensifies to low-level sourness right before and after the swallow, when the cherry flavor gets darker and mixes with chocolate on the sides of the mouth; there¬ís also a yeasty layer of soft bitterness, like a darker and chewier version of brett, which adds to the Samichlaus impression (because of the chewiness and it¬ís vaguely plumy character).  Finish is a lingering sweet and sour cherry that¬ís only a little dry.  Glittering gliding layer of lace not too sticky, but leaves an archipelago on the side when it does stick.  Racing is quick but deep.  I don¬ít know how anyone could think this isn¬ít delicious.  Almost better than dope.  Really close.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Consumed at Heeren van Lindekerke in June 2006 (12 years cellared)
Clear medium-dark ruby and burgundy colored body.  Nose consists of smooth creamy cherries, slightly sweet candy-like scent.  Flavor is crisp, lightly sour, has a good frothyness, somewhat peppy as well.  Light sharpness in the nose, syrupy cherry fruit and red grapes (wine) flavors, sum this one up fairly well.  Perhaps my bottle was a little oxidized, because I found some alcohol or acetone scents.  Has soda-like carbonation.  I tried pretty hard to find something remarkable in this one, but I did not find it.  Overall it¬ís good, but I did not feel it was worthy of the 100th percentile.  As a footnote: I truly love flemish sours.

Bottle shared by ryan, consumed June 2008 (11-12 years cellared)


Pours clear dark rusty brown in color, leaving a huge cement yeast cake on the bottom of the bottle.  Pungent, acidic, big and thick on the palate, sticky bread crust and vinegar and brown sugar everywhere.  Extremely deep and complex, but the richness and huge body is the real draw here.  Thick, sharp, acidic, wine-like at times, vinegar-like other times... excellent stuff.  Much better than the 1994 bottle I had in 2006.

Plus a very perfumey, aromatic aroma with red fruit, cherryessence, and felt. Somehow not convincingly natural. Sourish short onset followed byt the sweet, perfumey, unconvincing cherry(sweets) flavour. Sharp, spritzy carbonation that doesn¬ít appear visually. Some acidthinning in the body.

 Was: 8/4/7/5/13-3.7/5Deep red amber; good yellowish head, leaving some lace. End of the bottle pours solid hazy. Great Grand Cru nose with both lactic and acetic - AND a touch of fruit extract sweetness, even after all these years. Very good sour-sweet balance in the taste: here the age has done well, even when the MF still betrays the syrupy slickness. Bit of lemony flavour, grapefruit and blood oranges. Very tittilating beer, spritzy and sticky at the same time. I used to hate this beer - the best way of ruining a great Grand Cru. Then again, I expected age to be beneficial to this, and it was.

I still don¬ít prefer sour beers, but I may be able to get through this one.  Lots of sour cherry, Swedish Fish/SweetTart candy, red wine soaked wood,  and the sweet/tart flavors like my mom¬ís home made raspberry currant jelly.

Poured a beautiful clear deep amber with great carbonation and a nice fluffy lasting head with good lace.  Aroma is a kick in the face- as the cherry pie aromas dominate this beer.  Some Pedio and brett in the aroma, some tartness and sour all the way through, but not nearly as sour as many other lambics or flemish sours.  The flavor has the sourness lingering around the sides of the beer which come through after you notice the sweetness up front.   Sweet caramel, cherry, fruity, some plum, sherry, and red wine.  The woodiness of the oak comes through nicely in the middle as the beer mellows for a while.  As it warms a bit, the cherry cough syrup like flavors become even more apparent but I never found them to be overwhelming or annoying.  Mildly sour and tart finish but stil has that syrupy sweetness going on in the end.  Very nice overall.  Im very appreciative to have had a chance to drink this beer.

I couldn¬ít be happier to be wrong, thanks to Eyedrinkale.  I did my best to supply him with reasonable compensation for this bottle, but I¬ím afraid I fell far short.  Starting with appearance, this is dark red/brown and cloudy.  A thick layer of yeast stuck at the bottom of the bottle, refusing to budge.  The aroma is fantastically sweet and sour; cherries, oak and perhaps vinegar.  The flavor is oak, cherries, strawberries and smooth vanilla.  It is fantastically tart and sour.  The woody/tannic/vinous quality is the best I have ever experienced.  Usually, this has a bad connotation, but here it is entirely enjoyable.  It is not sweet, but not entirely dry.  Light carbonation gives way to a lush, velvety smooth texture.  Perfection.  I¬ím not sure when it will fully sink in that I will probably never get to experience this beer again.

1128,"2005-09-01",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2005 Sampled August 2005
Well thanks to some serious begging and pleading, I was given the opportunity to try this beer one more time.  The beer pours a brilliantly clear ruby-cherry-red color with barely a wisp of a head.  The sediment was so compacted in the bottle that I was able to pour the entire liquid contents out with nary a speck of sediment.  The aroma smells strongly of enticing cherry with a mix of sweet cherry meat, tannic cherry skin, and a tart acetic note that melds so well with it all.  My first impression, this has lost a lot of the sweetness up front, but quickly gains a rich meaty, malty cherry skin note to it.  The finish is lightly tannic with a slightly puckering note to it that is a combination of wood and a tart-sour character.

This beer has held up far better than the Pre-Palm Rodenbach Grand Cru.  The cherry, it seems, has acted as a preserving influence.  This really grabs the palate towards the end, it is mouth coating and malty with a very nice interplay between rich malt and cherry notes.  As it warms up a bit the acetic light vinegar note really starts to come forward.  The cherry note almost gets bigger (though not in a cloying or expressive way) and sort of spreads itself throughout the beer.  What an incredibly well balanced beer this has turned into.  The finish is long and gripping with notes of tannic cherry skin, yet still satisfyingly fruity with lots of cherry meat and a bit of balsamic character.  This is quite exquisite, I so would love to have more of this.  I find it really hard to not give this beer a really high score, it was very enjoyable, and the sweet cloying cherry character has really dropped out, just the opportunity to try this beer is almost a perfect experience.

One Flemish Sour to rule them all...Spotted by the eagle-eyed beer hunter MRomero548 and saved from the clutches of certain doom by the valiant Goldtwins, I have come into possession of the One True Flemish Sour.  With great anticipation I crack open the cap to be greeted by the familiar whoosh and rolling vapours of a well kept beer.  With fastidious care I release the contents of the bottle into my glass.  A billowing, ruby-tinged, soda head covers this hazy sanguine hued delight. Instantly I am surrounded by black cherry trees; evenly spaced and continuous to the horizon of the earth.  At my feet lies an old oak bucket with tarnished brass hardware and a supple leather handle.  A gentle breeze kicks up and the scent of nature in bloom greets me.  My hands fiddle with the cigar I rolled this morning.  Thinking the better of it, I place the cigar in my shirt pocket knowing how finely it will pair with a glass of sherry after dinner.  I can almost taste that balsamic vinaigrette and cranberry salad waiting for me at home.  Sipping the beer I find a firm initial sweetness is quickly overcome by a staunch acetic sourness.  Flavors roll over my tongue in a mild and oily manner.  Spritzy carbonation washes away any would be puckering harshness leaving behind a pleasantly dry tang...and in the tartness bind them.0,33l bottle, snifter.

Not a hugely complex aroma but very pleasing nonetheless. The flavor is dominated by cherries; even the vinegar takes a back seat. It is much sweeter than I expected, the acidity is really tempered by the sweetness.

It¬ís like putting on the t-shirt you wore yesterday when you played basketball in 90 degree heat.

1128,"2004-11-21",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2006 First beer of the gathering.  Not sure the date on this one (was it last made in 2000?) Bottle @ the Gathering.  I believe Eyedrinkale or Jeffin7 brought this, not sure.  Pours a dark ruddy orange/caramel color with some haziness perhaps?.  Small beige head.  Aroma is highly pungent: Cherries, wood, resinous earthy notes.  Great intensity on the aroma as well, even after the bottle had sat open for some time.  Flavor of cherry pits, more wood (oak,balsa, cedar) earth, lightly sour yeast.  But overall, wow, this is surprisingly tame.  I expected to be puckering my lips after this one.  Moderately sweet, medium to medium-full body, sticky palate up front but light tingly carbonation, loosens the palate (not too much so).  Lightly sweet toffee, maple and cherries mixed with citrus linger on the finish.  Regardless of how old this bottle is, it is has aged very nicely and shows no oxidation or thinning.  9/4/8/4/17Rerate from a bottle shared with Eyedrinkale in August 2005.  This was the most full bodied, succulent, well-aged treat I¬íd had in a while.  No syrupiness, not overly sweet.  Perfectly sour and quenching with huge amounts of flavor and a long, lingering bacteria/musty/yeasty finish.  Sour, but not TOO sour (if there is such a thing as too sour).  Dry, vinegar and balsa/cedar notes, with light chocolate and prunes and brown sugar.  Wonderful mouthfeel of tiny, tiny, bubbles popping in the mouth nicely.  Out of this world!  9/4/10/5/19Rating is an average of the three bottles I¬íve had, though I¬ím tempted just to use the most recent.

Small sticky off-white head. Aroma is very vinous, sweet cherries in abundance, well defined with obvious oak aged character that I love. Downright excellence in here, makes you wish you could bathe in one of Rodenbach's legendary oak casks. Nose also deploys light tartness and a bit of brown sugar. Great taste, very refreshing, full-flavoured cherries, very sweet and tart at the same time. You actually feel the seeds and branches a bit which is surprising considering that they used a cherry extract to my knowledge. Tons of oak, just lovely. This is a glorious meeting, but I must confess it could be a bit drier to fit my tastes perfectly, they've already done that with the grand cru though! Great tart aftertaste with more barrel character being revealed, this seems to support age wonderfully and shows no signs of fatigue for those still holding on some bottles, wonderfully lactic still. Thin-medium body, just appropriate and supported by medium carbonation. There is no way any good reason exists and is sufficient to end the production of this fine beer.

1128,"2003-03-29",3.2,"Thanks to MOboy for sending me a couple bottles of this from his stash. Pours a ruddy dark amber with a medium thin light tan head. Thin lacing. Aroma is just waiting to burst like a mob of Saturday morning shoppers waiting at the doors for a store to open during a big sale. Strong sherry, citrus, apple and grapes almost overwhelm. Unfortunately my first impression of the flavor reminded me of a cheap screw-top wine like Boone's. Sour and fruity with a light effervescent character. I am glad I got to try it as this is an interesting and complex beer, but honestly I don't think I would get it again if I had the chance.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
1128,"2003-03-24",4.3,"Invigorating aroma, with orange, spice, wood, cherry, faint tea leaves and cellar must.  Deep red-brown color, orange highlights and a head which settled gracefully.  Tart, tangy, fruity cherry juice flavor, tempered by waves of acidic sourness, bittersweet maltiness and earthy cask.  Finishes on a crescendo, exploding with juicy, fruity tartness.  This is somehow poised between absolute culture and pure wildness.  Excellently conceived.  One must hope for the return of this classic ale.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
1128,"2003-03-08",4.2,"A hazy rusty orange with a thin head and decent lace. Amazing nose of cherries, caramel, oak, vanilla and more. Thinnish body, almost syrupy texture, moderate carbonation. Up front flavors of sweet cherries, caramel apples turning sharper with acidity and sourness. The sweetness however remains. Wonderful interplay and balance.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
1128,"2003-03-02",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 29, 2004 it poured darkish brown with shades of orange, red, and rust making appearances..thin halo of small bubbles...aroma was a beautiful pile-up collision of malts, raisin bread, wine, sour cherry, shoe polish, and fruit jam..flavors of sweet cherry hinting at slight puckering sourness, more berry jam, slightly vinious..the mouthfeel here is syrupy and thickly sweet and modestly sour..nice refreshing beer","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
1128,"2003-02-28",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2008 I loved this beer.  A little hazy.  Reddish brown in color.  Pours with no head.  Aroma is sour(like vinegar), with some cherry and malt(slight).  Excellent flavor, almost like a cherry sherry with sourness.  Almost syrupy.  Delicious","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
1128,"2003-02-11",4.0,"Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing.
Body is hazy medium reddish-amber, dense tiny particles, bottle
conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (cookie, caramel), lightly yeasty
(cobwebs), with notes of cherry, cask wood, brown sugar. Flavor is
moderately sweet, heavily acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately
acidic. Medium body, watery (almost syrupy) texture, lively carbonation.
More cherry character than the Grand Cru of course, but just as sour (if
not slightly more so) and perhaps a bit less cloying. Great stuff.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1128,"2003-01-19",4.3,"Pours a bright red color with just a little, off-white head.  The aroma is magnificent, sweet and tart cherries, both must and wood, and it's slightly vinous.  The flavors are not quite as strong as the aroma, but still quite wonderful.  Sour cherries, wood, wine, a touch of vinegar and a hint of citrus.  A nice balance to both sweet and sour aspects.  Neither overpowers the other.  A wonderful beer.  I've still got one more.  Hopefully I can even find others.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
1128,"2003-01-08",4.0,"Vinegary aroma, which is mostly dominated by fresh, soft, sweet cherry essence.  Oddly, only a slightlest trace of wood.  Rusty fluid with retentive and unsticky whisp of foam.  Semi-soft mouthfeel, medium carbonation.  First sip yields intense sourness, followed by almond extract and lots of woody undertones.  The conclusion is near puckering with sour plum notes.  A bit lacking in the complexity department, but, still, I don""t see a beer in its class improving much upon this.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1128,"2002-12-25",3.8,"Sweet cherry aroma and pours with absolutely no head.  The flavor profile is quite complex and goes through a period of stages including sweet, sour, and vinegar.  Reminiscent of cider.  Has a slight musty oak taste toward the finish, but is still a very good brew.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1128,"2002-12-25",3.7,"Reddish, brownish, orangish. Vinegar aroma with some fruit and wine. Starts sweet on the tongue but oh so tart in the end. A nice drink but I can¬ít handle too many.","Nolanville, USA","MrRomero"

1128,"2002-12-06",4.2,"Deep amber with a touch of ruby.  Tall head that rapidly retreats.  Cherries, oak and basalmic vinegar aromas.  Flavors of fresh yogurt, kiwi/passion fruit and iron backed by a fresh cherry sweetness. My favorite in the Rodenbach line.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1128,"2002-11-17",4.2,"33 CL bottle drank 11/02:  Pours a medium red orange color with floaters, quickly ending head.  Stunning acidic sweet cherry vinegar aroma.

1128,"2002-09-16",4.5,"To bad it¬ís history...

Reddish brown color, small head. The typical vinous taste of a Belgian Reds. There is a slight cherry taste to this beer. Not sweet but very complimentary to the sourness. Aftertaste is slightly vinous, no bitterness slight hoppyness. NICE BEER.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
1128,"2002-09-10",4.3,"The best of the best when it comes to fruity beers.  A sweet cherry taste tops off this fine Belgian Ale.  I just wish I could find it now that it¬ís no longer brewed...","Orange, California, USA","Blake"
1128,"2002-09-06",4.7,"This was one terrific beer too bad they have discontinued it. Amazing and complex cherry presence with a nice sourness that causes a pucker everytime. I just hope the Grand Cru makes it¬ís way back to the states soon.","Michigan, USA","softale"
1128,"2002-09-01",3.6,"A sweet chery flavor, not as tart as the ¬íOriginal¬í.  Out of production and hard to find, but worth trying if you can find it.  The volume was not sufficient for Palm to continue production.","Cedar Knolls, New Jersey, USA","gbzia"

1128,"2002-08-20",4.7,"Big sour cherry aroma.  The color is a wonderful ruby red/bronze.  The sour cherry flavor is one of the best I¬íve had.  Extremely complex.  The hints of oak work well with the tartness of the cherries.  To discontinue this should be a crime.","Redondo Beach, California, USA","Jajoro"

1128,"2002-08-02",4.4,"Man these beers from Rodenbach are appetizing!  The aroma isn¬ít quite as sharp as the Grand Cru, although similar in complexity, and with more cherry character obviously.  Pleasantly sour, apple-y, with nice oak notes.  Doesn¬ít have quite the mouth pucker of the Grand Cru either, but it still has an amazing, lingering aftertaste.  It vexes me how this could be the second best beer from a brewery,  and it vexes me why a beer this good can is being dropped like an old hat.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
1128,"2002-07-08",4.2,"Bottle.  A ruby red color with no head.  The aroma is at first tart and sour and then a sweet cherry, strawberry, and sour apple aroma takes over.

1128,"2002-04-06",1.7,"Fruit beer adverse drinkers Beware!!! No wonder why this ones getting the boot. After going over the great reviews I highly anticipated trying this. At first glance the dark red color made this beer look pretty incredible but it all ended there. Just an overwhelming bitter-sour cherry taste that got worse as I drank it. I was just hoping it would get better as it warmed up.","New Brunswick, New Jersey, USA","parkerman"
1128,"2002-03-22",4.5,"Definitely a dessert beer like the back of the bottle so proudly quotes Michael Jackson as saying. The color is on of the best I¬íve ever seen in a beer. It¬ís a deep ruby color that you could get lost in. The head is thin and dissipates quickly. Sweet cherry nose with hints of white wine underneath. The taste is sweet cherries and is surprisingly sour. Very much like a fruit lambic. Very enjoyable.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
1128,"2002-03-14",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 4, 2004 8/14/01 orig rating 3/14/02 rerating -- bottled 2000?  Lots of floating matter in this one; very thick and still-looking, with wonderful orange opaque hue.  Head diminishes fast.  Aroma strong on the cherries, malt, grapes and yeast with perhaps a touch of bitter herbs.  Flavor kicks ass!  Very potent sour-cherry taste with strong spiciness--pepper and perhaps vanilla?  Finish almost too strong for me; stays on the tongue a long time.  Better than the 'classic' and such a shame its gone now (I got the last 4 (now 3) bottles in Burlington).

Flemish Sour Tasting with MartinT & Rastacouere Part 1 #4.  So this bottle (3rd to my last, sniff!) is now approximately 4 years old, but little the worse for wear.  My review stays basically the same, with one point off the flavor line, in part just because it doesn't quite compete with some of the other masterpieces that followed...","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1128,"2002-02-20",3.7,"absolutely wonderful.  This kicks the original Rodenbach (classic) in the ass.  Great balance of sweet/tart cherries with the signature sourness from Robenbach.

Word of its demise was already out by the time it hit the shelves, so I stocked up as much as my broke ass could.  In September 2008 I sampled my last bottle with Beershine and Kimchee.  It was quite sweet up front, but got drier as it progressed through a rich cherryish body towards a lingering tart finish that eventually grips the throat.  It‚Äôs got a deep rodenbachy aroma with abundant cherry still, even after 8 years.  The body is starting to show a bit of thinness - it‚Äôs an old age for such a light beer.  But otherwise, this is still going strong, the sense of balance undisturbed and the quality still evident.  RIP Alexander.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
