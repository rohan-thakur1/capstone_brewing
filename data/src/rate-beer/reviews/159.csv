159,"2017-04-12",4.7,"Twilight of the Idols showcases Hill Farmsteads mastery of restraint. You get whispers of the added cinnamon, vanilla, and coffee but never so much that they overstay their welcome. This near-black brew puts bright, rich, and bitter toasted grains at the fore of the mouth and finishes with slight sweetness. The vanilla and cinnamon add a subtle layer of spiciness to the brew. The mouthfeel is creamy - velvety smooth. This is some damn fine stuff.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

159,"2016-12-29",3.8,"Une bière noire, à grande carbonatation, avec une couleur fort opaque. Au nez, cest très torréfié, avec des odeurs prévalantes de café et de cacao, rappelant peut-être un peu plus un stout quun porter. Au goût, le café dominé également, avec un petit goût sucré que jattribue au sucre dorge et à la mélasse. Pour un porter, on sattendrait peut-être à plus complexe, avec beaucoup de café. Le corps est bien calibré, présent mais pas trop lourd, crémeux, rappelant un millk stout. La bière nest peut-être pas ultra originale mais fait bien le travail.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","LouisP"

159,"2016-12-21",3.7,"Apparence : Pas totalement noire, carbonatation moyenne, beau col brun ayant une bonne rétention et une dentelle intéressante sur le verre. 
Nez : Grains rôtis plein le nez en première impression. On note par la suite le café (bien rôti) et un peu de vanille qui vient tenter de balancer les notes grillées. 
Goût : Malt rôti, café, touche de vanille et de chocolat. Peu sucrée et peu amère, ce dernier aspect se pointant surtout en finale avec une touche épicée que jattribue à la cannelle. 
Sensation : Corps moyen à mince, longueur moyenne en bouche effervescence plutôt faible. 
Bref : On a ici droit à une bière sans contredit dominée par les notes rôties et ce, autant au nez quen bouche. Lapport de la vanille ici, quoiquintéressant, est peut-être trop discret pour empêcher le malt et le café déclipser plusieurs subtilités que lon pourrait peut-être trouver dans ce liquide. La cannelle, qui na pas figuré au rendez-vous dun point de vue gustatif, se manifeste par un côté épicé qui vient tout de même nous épargner dune finale redondante sur les tons de grillé. Facile à boire, elle remplit son rôle de Porter, malgré un taux dalcool plus élevé que ce quon retrouve traditionnellement. Agréable, mais pas renversante.","Quebec, CANADA","Adamsville"

The appearance was a dark brown mostly close to black color with a great two finger foamy off white to tan head. Mild lacing roaming all around the glass.
The aroma took on a great amount of roasty to smooth sweet cocoa to coffee great bitterness. Subtle cinnamon, but super low key, really, it is. Some vanilla bean.
The flavor rides on the smoothness of the sweet to roasty cocoa to coffee bean. Subtle riding bitter to a smooth roasty coffee aftertaste sliding on into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium like a good American styled porter should sit. Carbonation felt exactly right for what it should be.

159,"2016-06-23",3.7,"500 mL bottle shared by Chris with Doug, Ryan, and I. The pour is a darker brown color with a nice mahogany hue and a thicker tan head that falls down leaving a pretty good lace. The aroma is very roasty right up front. There is a light coffee, a slight hint of vanilla and a definite milkiness to this. There is a light chocolate there, more of a cocoa powder that seems to drown out the vanilla. The flavor is similar. Very roasty with a lactose sweetness. There is a light chocolate, maybe a little caramel, but the vanilla just isnt prominent at all. The mouth feel is surprisingly thin, but the carbonation helps it seem thicker than it really is. The aftertaste is light coffee, and a roasty lactose finish. Its an interesting beer, but I definitely wish there was more vanilla.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Seemingly good clarity with a tan head atop that is medium-sized and fades quickly to cover.Vanilla and cinnamon are easily picked out of the nose, as a dark chocolate backdrop keeps things ""dry"" and very porter-like. I honestly get more house yeast character than anything, and thankfully, the coffee is nice and restrained, adding only a light amount of roast. Biscuity, chocolate-laden malts linger, with more cinnamon spiciness and no alcohol or flaw.Lots of cinnamon in the flavor, drying things out considerably, with spicy vanilla quite apparent as well. Dark chocolate, very light roast, bits of prune/plum and very low sweetness on top of a medium-light body with low carbonation. Its drinkable and nicely attenuated with no forceful malt sweetness or alcohol, but I could do with less cinnamon and probably less vanilla, even granting that this is a holiday spiced porter.

This might not be ubber fresh by no way should so much vanilla or cinnamon fade to nothing this quickly. Hill Farmstead is for sure a very good but the nearly religious cult of Shaun Hill worship remains lost for me.

159,"2016-03-28",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 3, 2016 Bottle traded for some Struise vintages in Ghent, cheers Xavier! Very curious about this, seen the fact that this brewery has been hyped by beer geeks to a very large extent in recent years, more so for its saisons and IPAs perhaps, but still... Thick, dense and moussy, yellowish beige, lightly lacing head over a blackish beer with hazy but translucent chestnut brown edges. Complex aroma: a lot of beef stock and bitter chocolate, some faint shoe polish-like solvents but actually fitting in well, old blanket, salmiak, dry earth, bayleaf, subtle and hardly noticeable vanilla touch, dried nettles, white pepper, elderberry, wet leather and, after warming up, a lovely, unexpected, sweet hint of red wine or even sherry. Very umami-like onset, stewed beef and even some dried porcini, low but effective sweetishness of dried fruits, rounded and slightly oily, creamy mouthfeel with velvety texture and soft carbo, some elderberry-like sourishness underlying; caramelly malts turning immediately nutty and eventually toasted, leading to a bitter chocolatey, lightly coffeeish roasted, mouth-filling bitterness; peppery and spicy hop bitterness adds dryness while a basic roasted barley sourishness lingers and retronasally, elegant and subtle hints of vanilla and red wine appear. Technically perfect, the vanilla aspect could have been a lot more pronounced in my opinion, but instead I got unexpected sherryish or red wine-like aromas which make this altogether different from most other porters. Subtle, delicate, completely satisfying example of the style, very glad I tasted this - now on the lookout for more beers from Shaun Hill.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Deep, nearly black body with a tan-mocha foam that builds up quickly & diminishes just as fast to a thin film & chunky collar. Big tannic aroma, lots of wet & sharp oak. Why? This is not even barrel aged... Where is this woodiness coming from? Mildly tart plum & black cherry spread over a bed of roasted cocoa beans, light coffee grounds, & faint milk chocolate. The tart dark fruitiness doesnt carry over to the palate (which is good, I assume), & theres only a small hint of anise & raisin. The flavor is most a pile of dry cocoa beans, blackened malt just shy of charred status, light vanilla bean, & a touch of roasted coffee beans; not quite Italian roast, but maybe a touch more than French. I was expecting a sweeter porter, but this is definitely more kiltered to the roasty side of things. Very faint cinnamon character throughout. VERY mild. Perhaps that was the first adjunct to bite the dust. Thin-ish mouth feel, even for a ""porter"". Im sick of that excuse... Porters can have voluptuousness, too.

Black pour, small brown head. Aroma of rich, dark, roasted coffee, roasted malts, soy, and some wood, with what i can only describe as hot pepper aroma, minus the heat, must be the cinnamon. Very soft carb, mouth feel is a little thinner that expected. The finish is woody, and herbal. Coffee and roasted malts linger and are very pleasant, bitterness is medium to low. A nice porter, but im thinking this might have fallen into the hill farmstead hype machine.","Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, CANADA","robinvboyer"
159,"2014-03-14",4.1,"Bottle (7,2% ABV). An opaque black beer, with a large, frothy, fully lasting brown head. The aroma is moderately to heavily malty (coffee, roasted grain, chocolate, caramel), lightly hoppy (grapefruit), with notes of cinnamon, some vanilla and berries.

Medium body, velvety texture, lively/fizzy carbonation, pretty dry and long finish with moderate bitterness, very lightly alcoholic. It feels really clean with pure, all but artificial flavors.

159,"2013-07-03",3.8,"500mL bottle from JMRSN. Thanks! Because nothing says summer like a winter porter.

A: Do you like some head? Because this pour fills about half my glass with a light cappucino foam. Very dark mahogany. Decent legs. Also, the bottle has a single bubble blown out of it like a childs bubble toy. 

N: Coffee, raisin, cola, chocolate, caramel, and vanilla. Theres some blackberry mixed in here as well.

T: Very, very bitter/earthy with a lot of cinnamon spice. Theres a decent amount of sweetness here. Very, very assertive.

M: Maybe a touch light given the ABV, but the carbonation is pleasant and its got a good chalkiness.

Unfortunately, I picked up no cinnamon in the aroma or the flavor. Another Hill Farmstead beer that would have been better with more viscosity.

159,"2012-12-23",2.9,"UPDATED: DEC 28, 2012 OK, you lovers of hill farmstead dont want me to rate this. I rate by how much I enjoyed it and a rating near 3 is good! I double checked with the guy who brought this to the tasting and he said it was authentic. Starts off with a very nice pour.  Big flip top bottle. Very nice and attractive aroma or slightly burned wood with perhaps, a little vanilla in there but it is not in the forefront of the olfactory. First taste is quite strong and alky, makes me think this should be in the baltic porter style if you know what I mean. Initial bitterness tend to fade as the session continues however, alky wants to stay in the forefront - does not hide alky content well. How many porters do you know, which are not baltic, that have such a high alky rating? 7.5%?  Very little co2. Finish is old wet  and damp burned campfire wood from 2 weeks ago. Not bad but it could be a little more mannered and well behaved for the standard porter style. IMHO this should be in the baltic porter style.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

The aroma shows ashy notes, with chocolate, wet grain, and a touch of dark fruit.  The flavor reveals a lot of creamy vanilla bean and assertive espresso notes; silky smooth going down, with a ton of semi-sweet chocolate on the back end thats accompanied by roasty and earthy hop bitterness.  Theres even an touch of holiday spicing deep in the background.  This is delicious stuff thats incredibly well put together.

We all come from the same place (the punani), and the punani can bring beer for us.  The pour is jet, thick, with tan well laced head.

Tastes complex, rich, intense, with roasty choc/patent malts, cacao, resiny hops, espresso, Dark choc syrup, and a heavy cinnamon, nutmeg, and spicy overtone.  Tastes a lot like Alpha Klaus to me, which is a good thing.  Heres my take on this one:  Mix 1 part Bells Java with 2 parts Alpha Klaus and 2 parts Southern Tier (Choc Dessert Beer, the name of which I cannot recall at the moment), and you have this beer, albeit kicked up a notch.

Oatmeal cookies ground coffee and vanilla flavors, as chocolate and roastiness add depth to this dessert brew.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the brown-edged blackness.
-The natural carbonation makes the body so comfortable, as is the case with all HFarmstead brews.
-There is a lot going on, yet the complexity and intensity are never overwhelming. Its a true pleasure to drink.
-Alcohol is a no show, which is appreciated.

Aromatic malts, cocoa, vanilla, cinnamon, coffee is also there with some spice. Really everything as advertised. The flavor is different. Some bitter astringency comes in, it becomes spicier. The vanilla is there but far less than in the aroma, it is just a subtle touch of smoothness that it lends to the beer. Teh cinammon is there and reminds me of a holiday spiced dish. Coffee, cinamon, malt, and cocoa dominate the flavor. After more drinks it feels like there are more spices in here but perhaps it is a certain blend of coffee that is aiding the cinamon.

159,"2012-11-06",4.6,"Fall/Winter 2012 vintage. 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. The HF website lists this beer as being brewed with coffee and cinnamon, but the ingredient lists and description on the label has no mention of cinnamon. Recipe change perhaps?

A - Pours a very dark black body. Holding it up to the light lets just a bit shine through to show a very dark brown color. Dense and creamy two finger mocha head forms and dissipates rather slowly into a thin cap with thick edging. Lacing and retention is just insane on this beer. Super sticky and clinging foam.

S - Roasty and smoky with intense espresso beans and rich vanilla. Finish is of sweet milk chocolate and a touch of spice. Excellent aroma, very dark and roasty.

T - Roasted malts lead into a strong vanilla presence. Notes of coffee and sweet milk chocolate intertwine. The intense roastiness of the beer is cut by an almost syrup like level of sweetness. Extremely decadent and delicious but slightly cloying.

M - Creamy and silky with a perfect level of carbonation. Swishing the beer in your mouth causes it to instantly froth up. It finishes surprisingly dry which helps with the intense syrupy sweetness of the beer. The mouthfeel is just perfect here.

O - An exceedingly complex and intense porter. I assume Everett is the base beer due to matching abvs. I do prefer Everett in that its much simpler and basic while perfecting all the qualities that make a world class porter. The addition of ingredients seems to make a great thing a bit less great. Still a world class porter that is exceedingly enjoyable on a cold ass night.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Hmmm...not impressed.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Massive brownie and espresso gives way to spicy cinnamon chocolate, caramel, molasses, and a roast presence that simply wont quit. Vanilla in the finish, with all the deliciousness of roasted barley... sans bitter astringency. The palate is amazingly thick- thicker than any porter Ive had, and even most stouts. Creamy rich carbonation with a velvety mouthfeel and soft finish. The perfect winter porter.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
159,"2011-11-19",4.5,"On tap at release.  Really wanting this one, pours out a fantastic black as night pour, off white/coffee head.  The coffee bursts out the nose on the aromas, some spice, and a sweet background.  Palate is so smooth and rich, the vanilla really rounds out a finish that ends a beer filled with smooth coffee and cocoa.  Big and robust, amazing!","South Hadley, Massachusetts, USA","cakanator"

159,"2011-10-27",4.1,"From the tank at the brewery. Pours dark brown to black with a small and tan head. Aroma is coffee, toffee caramelish, roasted malt and quite clear vanilla notes - more vanilla than its Danish twin brew from Fanø. Smooth dark roasted to toffee sweet malty flavoured. Light sweetness mixed with a distinct vanilla presence. Smooth roasted malty and bitter finish. Lingering toffee, chocolate, coffee and smooth yet declining vanilla.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
159,"2011-04-14",4.2,"Growler filled at the Bruery on 11.04.2010. Poured into a Bruery tulip.

Color is near black with a really strong tan head and loads of spotty lacing with a ring of light head and spots atop throughout. The nose brings a really nice, slight bourbon character. Its not overpowering, but is somewhat mellow with a nice vanilla and oak creaminess to it. Some slight chocolate in the background as well.

The taste is nice with a bittersweet chocolate character layered underneath a good presence of vanilla. Again, some really nice and mellow bourbon notes and a hint of oak. Medium body with a slight hint of booze. Overall, a fantastic brew from Shaun and the vanilla really shines through.

Serving type: growler

159,"2011-02-02",4.1,"In short: A superb rich and complex porter/stout
How: Tap on location directly at the brewery
The look: Near black body topped by a beige ring of foam
In long: The enticing nose brings out roasted coffee beans and a freshly baked fruit cake.  Taste is roasted coffee beans, vanilla, cacao, Queen Elizabeth cake, black chocolate, dark fruits, well integrated spicy notes, some fresh tobacco leafs.  The list of flavor elements I noted is pretty standard.  However the whole beer was more than the sum of its parts.  Very cohesive.  Very rich and nourishing without feeling heavy.  Named after the work of the famous Friedrich Nietzsche, the man who declared that God was dead.  Body was never found.  Investigation ongoing.  Nietzsche still prime suspect.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Aroma was full of coffee with a pretty present cinnamon note and hints of bourbon and molasses. Flavor was strong coffee throughout with some bourbon and hints of cinnamon and molasses in the finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
159,"2011-01-05",4.0,"Growler thanks to grassrootsvt.  Pours a very dark brown color with a one finger tan head that fades to swirls.  Big rich chocolatey aroma, along with vanilla and roasty notes.  Chocolate - Tootsie Roll or Hersheys bar - is big on the flavor.  Behind that is roast, coal, cinnamon, and vanilla.  Tasty.  Medium-bodied and fairly dry on the mouthfeel with a good long finish. Really good porter, impressive.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

159,"2010-12-21",4.2,"Back to Vermont after my senior fall in college; boy have I missed this brewery. On tap at the Farmhouse in Burlington. Black pour with a beautiful ivory head. Nose is simply divine; roasted malt, coffee beans, vanilla extract, cinnamon, and caramel. The flavor holds more chocolate and vanilla, balanced by a wonderful roast and char characteristic. Touches of molasses and dark fruit sweetness really add to the taste as well. The palate is thick and lush, full but not overdone. Fantastic brew, maybe my favorite porter ever.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
159,"2010-12-17",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 18, 2010 Poured from a growler which had leaked just. A tad and was evident to a smaller degree... pours a somewhat dull reddish cola brown with lighter edges and a virtually non-existent head...aroma of roasted coffee for the majority and then specks of vanilla come into play...  Flavors are a nice combination of roast and coffee with enough vanilla to complete the amalgamation. Smooth consistency of flavors, semi-sweet in nature, where the coffee and  vanilla take hold. Very light on the carbonation but doesnt totally detract away from it.  finishes clean without any residual sweetness. nice.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

Appearance : Pitch black with no head. Some lacing.

Aroma : Great roasted malt with some vanilla. Rich vanilla with dark chocolate. Light notes of raisins and othe fruits.

Taste : Nice roasted malt with vanilla. A tiny bit acidic maybe. Light hops. Nice chocolate finish.

Overall : Very rich yet very well balanced. Surprisingly big and rich for such a low abv. Nice complexity. Id love to try this one again.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

On tap at the Gingerman NYC. it tastes of appropriate Winter Xmas style spice and will be a favorite oF mine for some time to come.

159,"2010-10-16",4.7,"On tap and in growler from the brewery, the flavors vary slightly between the two tastings in interesting ways.

It pours a rich, dark brown with a tan head, dissipating slowly into a nice thin foam. Aroma on tap is slightly sharper with a bit more coffee, while from a growler it was a little more vanilla balanced with the coffee.

Taste is outstanding both on tap and in growler, with medium sweet malt backbone, a touch of hop bitterness and coffee, vanilla and just a hint of the cinnamon in the finish, with no discernible alcohol or indication of its ABV. Carbonation is on the money for the style, and its full bodied without being heavy.

Exceedingly well balanced, this is a wonderful beer.","Derby, Vermont, USA","GatheringBrews"
