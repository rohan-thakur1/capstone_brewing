810,"2011-05-31",3.0,"In short: A very sweet/sugary and somewhat boozy pilsner on steroids.  Too harsh.
How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed fresh (probably fresh) one week after purchase
The look: Cloudy yellow blonde body topped by a large white head with excellent retention
In long: Nose is moderately dry-grass with notes of a fresh baguette and sweet white cake.  Taste is loaded with pale malts and what appears to be sugary crystal malts.  Flavor of white bread baguette topped with fresh banana slices and with a lot of refined white sugar spread all over it.  Also notes of pineapples.  Then comes the dry grassy hops with a slight spicy edge.  Short and sharp bitterness.  Alcohol is apparent.  The beer is clean, crisp and sharp but it is overall just too sweet and too harsh for the style.  It wants to be exaggeratedly cranked-up german pilsner and it probably is exactly that.  But for my thirsty palate I found my little 22oz bomber a bit long to drink.  Basically I think that a 9.5% german pilsner makes as much sense as an Individualists Union.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Thick layer, yellowish center & lemon yellow circle. Subtle malty but intense hoppy aroma, kind perfumed. Heavy & dry bitterness all over - feel the chains of a Panzer tank rolling on your tongue.

Bit of ureum and toasted grains coming then. Malty, even corn, but with again toasted (especially in the finish) and EU hops; bitterish finish, if the main body is sweet. Grapes retronasal. Well-carbonated, but the finish has some astringency, if mildly so. Infinitely better than the usual malt liquor.

810,"2011-03-01",3.4,"Aroma reveals pilsener malt and saaz hops.  Pours a golden yellow with a very active carbonation.  taste is initially hyper-malty with a strong alcohol flavor typical of Imperial Pilsners.  It quickly turns bitter with a bite of hops which I surmise must be caused by the Tettnang Hops since all Saaz hops versions are more mellow in the hop area.","Pennsylvania, USA","jsmerig"

810,"2011-01-17",3.1,"Poured into a pint glass.

3.5 A: Clear medium yellow color. Two fingers of frothy head with less than average retention and some lacing.

3.0 S: Not much of anything going on in the nose. Somewhat bready malts, but otherwise nothing. Id expect a pils this strong to put out more.

4.0 T: Taste is much more on par with what I was expecting. Healthy hop bitterness. Some earthy and spicy hop flavor. A little hot, which works helps rather than hinders. Somewhat grainy malts, yet bready as well. Not the greatest, but not bad either.

4.5 M: Heavier medium body. Good creaminess going on. Warms throughout, but especially on finish. Good carbonation.

3.5 D: I cant imagine having more than a bomber of this. Its too hot for that. Good, not great.

810,"2010-06-20",3.5,"22 oz bottle. For such a big beer, this is quite straightforward and simple. Not too unlike a lighter vodka with a little extra fruit and bitterness mixed in. None of that is in a bad way though, as the simple character works well in this sipping beer. The aroma is clean, though slightly boozy. Notes of herb, grass, light bread, mixed heavy grapefruit, peach, and other mixed citrus fruits. Very light, bubbling head on the pour. The body of the beer looks a good deal like a concentrated orange-pineapple fruit juice. Theres a cutting crispness in the body that gives way to slightly sticky hop finish. The flavor notes again are simple, but of high quality. Herbs and more herbs, grass, potato, and mixed citrus. Overall, this was an enjoyable beer. Im undecided about this style in general, but will definitely give similar beers a go around.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"
810,"2010-06-13",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Crisp straw is emboldened by a friendly herbal hop intensity until this noble hop spiciness takes over for a bitter and lightly alcoholic finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam sticks to the top of the hazy blond. 
-The mouthfeel is not too heavy, making this Imperial Pilsener quite easy to drink even though it is 9% abv.
-The prickly effervescence also helps this drinkability. 
-The overall flavour profile is balanced and just intense enough for what you expect from this type of brew. 
-The spicy, herbal hop bitterness benefits from the well-dried out second half.

I can only think of one other imperial pils I have had (Samuel Adams), and this is mellower.  It is not overly hopped, like one might expect from an imperial pilsner.  It is more like a strong, sweet pils.  RB calls it a European strong lager.  How about a new category for imperial pilsners?

Surprisingly not an amped up aroma.  Very sweet and malty tasting.  Corn, bread, sticky honey, grain, bitter hops.  Ok, no hiding the Imperial part of this here.  A sharp alcohol sting that is really distracting.  A bit sour too.  Shows every bit of 9.5% and then some.  Meh.  Once upon a time I liked the idea of an Imperial Pilsner and since this seems like a pretty good representation of one I guess I dont anymore.  It just doesnt have the crisp and refreshing qualities I love from a good Pils.  I guess sometimes less is better.  I will say that this grew on me a bit after I wrote these comments.

810,"2010-02-24",3.5,"Hazy pale blonde beer topped by a lasting white foam that recedes to cover. Clean and soft aroma where the alcohol remains mostly subtle. Instead, minerally grassiness and grainy malts are offering a balanced, albeit subtle performance. In mouth, I was initially quite impressed by its alcohol masking capacities, but as it warmed up, its 9.5% outgrew it and became annoying to me. Still, for an imperial pils, this does a gracious job of providing rich pils malt flavours and conveys an almost bright hoppiness of the most noble kind: floral, grassy, gently spicy. Densely carbonated medium body. While still sweeter than Id like, it possesses a more than fair dryness as opposed to more impy pilsners and its appropriate hopping enhances that feeling. All in all, a successful offering and yet another good lager from these guys, but as some of their others, their schwarzbier for instance, its ale-ish.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Interesting play of the citrus hops, piney hops and the spicy nobles, slightly biscuity malts, some sweetness and a light touch of alcohol as it warms, floral and fragrant.  First taste follows aroma, interesting and new play of citrus, pine and noble, just slightly cheesy, actually seemingly balanced between the the flavors which seems almost like it was mixed rather than brewed that way, malts are biscuity, sugary sweet but finishing dryer, fairly clean finish, very very bitter, love the bitterness, SUPER BITTER. Alcohol blends well with flavor, not noticeable unless one looks for it.  Lively sizzling carbonation that doesnt allow one to focus on the typical Port syrupy viscousness, makes it crisp but soft overall.  I have a feeling some of the biscuitiness is partly due to slight oxidation, maybe would be a bit better if the PNW hops were toned down a tad and a little less residual sugar... of course Im really just drawing comparisons to Sam Adams Imp Pils... =p  I applaud any brewer who decides to try and pull this style off... we really need more of these ultra bitter pils.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

Creamy medium body, very tight carb, a little bit of carbonic bite. Not unpleasant at all, and understated. Biscuits, pine, and grapefruit on the mid palate. Very bitter resiny finish. Nothing newsworthy by beer geek standards, but on the high side and rather sharp with that carbonic bite under it. Long dry resiny finish with maybe a little twang creeping in on it. Surprisingly refreshing for 9.5, thats for sure, and the booze is well hidden except for that seeming twang in the finish (long after the beer leaves the mouth).","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

I was hoping that coming from Lost Abbey/Port Brewing this would be a nice amped up pilsener in the vein of what New Glarus released a while ago.  Instead it was a bit too much; the alcohol or something else detracts from what would otherwise be a solid pils.

Aroma / Appearance - Carbonated rose gold liquid starts promisingly.  A radiant white head glowed like the morning sun.  Crisp warm multigrain bread fresh from the oven was not quite what I expected but still good enough.  Lemon pledge gave it a hoppy background.

Flavor / Palate - Hoppy with a wheat bite the alcohol takes this one over the top.  A honeylike finish is acceptable but this could be so much more.  Overall it is drinkable and I have no major complaints for a $7.99 release.  However if you are used to Port only releasing gems temper your expectations somewhat before opening it.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Aroma is very hoppy, especially for the style with a very strong alcohol presence as well as bready yeast, pilsner malt and some earthy grass/straw notes.

This beer is very hop forward and lingers into a bready yeasty body with a decent pilsner malt backbone. Slight earthy grass notes are followed by a very astringent strong alcohol finish. I dont really know how you could call this a pilsner. It seems like they pitched some pilsner malt into some kind of hoppy alcohol juice. Way too hoppy and too much of an alcohol presence. The body is full with some of the above mentioned bready yeast but the ABV is not masked at all. This beer is kind of a sloppy mess.

Nose of sweet malts and  a wonderful excess of hops.  Taste of sweet malts and enormous bitter hoppiness, in perfect balance.  I love this, but I cannot really call it an imperial pils.

A little ethanol and mineral come out as it warms. Flavor is spicy grass, floral, sweet and cereal grain, a little toasted grain, limestone, a hint of orange marmalade, sweet floral notes, a berry like sweetness, a little palate smacking brings out some fruity, berry notes, theres some ethanol and grapefruit near the finish. More cereal and sweet grain notes come out as it warms. Finishes off with light grapefruit, spicy grass, bitter and herbal hops, dandelion green and some mineral and medicinal notes to the fade, the medicinal notes are not too bad and get better as it warms, and appear to continue getting better as it approaches room temperature, but the beer gets pretty hot and sweet by that point. Palate is medium body with a creamy/oily feel and moderate carbonation. Really strange brew with a lot going for it, unfortunately it has a few off notes against it as well. It seems to keep alot of Pilsner like flavors and aromas in its imperial quest but loses much of the subtlety of a good pils with the hot ethanol and odd bitter/medicinal/dandelion notes. All of that being said, I still enjoyed this brew, quite a few quibbles for a decent score I guess.

Nose is very faint for a 9.5% beer; notes of cookie, tangerine, floral, white pepper, and faint biscuity notes.  Flavor is similar with not much intensity; light honey and faint cookie make up the malt notes, some dusty yeast, and hops which are lemon zest, floral, lightly herbal, and lightly spicy.  Palate is lightly warm, crisp, medium, lively, and somewhat round; interesting to be round and crisp.  Finishes a bit offputting with some alcohol, light floral, and lingering notes of pepper and herbal hops.  It was weird to have a beer with a less than moderate bitterness but so much pepper and herbal hop notes, not really something that I enjoyed.  A style that seems to be very inconsistent ranging from very light, crisp strong lager-type beers, to full, very complex beers, almost ale-like due to the high OG, and this one seemed to fit somewhere on the lighter side with a more full body.  I think what is really throwing me is the fact that this one is very table-strength-pils-like and I am not a big fan of that style; usually the ESLs tend to carry more ale characteristics and more bitterness, which I like.  One of my favorite breweries but not one of favorites from them.  If you like pilsners, this one is literally just a stronger version.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

The flavor has a solid foundation of paler malt that is sweet but clean in its profile, then there are a ton of citrucy and spicy hops with definite grapefruit flavors.   The finish is very hoppy and bitter but balanced by a pretty big sweetness.   Medium-full body with a lightly mouth-coating texture and medium-intense carbonation.

810,"2009-04-07",3.0,"From a 22oz Bottle.  Mostly transparent, honey gold colored pour with a thin layer of tight bubbled, fizzy white head.  Aromas of resinous, piney hops.  Some sweet, sugary malt sweetness is also present, along with some moderately high alcohol levels.  The hop aroma smells nice at first, but when combined with the alcohol and malt sweetness, it creates somewhat of a harsh, abrasive sensation.  Medium bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel with a moderate sweetness.  The malt flavors arent heavy enough to qualify as sticky, but are too sweet to reveal a clean, pilsner malt breadiness.  Hop flavors are bold and resinous, but the crispness of the hop bitterness is disguised by the underlying malt sweetness.  A moderately high level of alcohol comes in on the back end, creating a somewhat harsh finish.  This seems to disrupt the bold hop flavors, as they transition into a brash alcohol finish rather than simply enhance the dryness on the back end.  Enough potential to look forward to future batches.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
810,"2009-04-01",3.5,"One extra point in Appearance simply for the bottle.  Awesome.
Pours a clear golden color with plenty of active carbonation, chunky white head that sticks around forever and leaves plenty of lacing.
Aromas of earthy bread and smooth doughy sweetness.
Flavor starts with a tamed toasty malt sweetness balanced by the rather apparent alcohol warming.  Some spicy and mildy citric hops make an appearance in the middle of the palate without playing too much of a part.
Clean on the palate, though some of the grainy sweetness does remain for too long.","framingham, Massachusetts, USA","twitcher"
810,"2009-03-30",3.5,"22oz bottle courtesy of a generous BA.

Pours a clear golden amber with a big fluffy white head that recedes slowly to a ring, leaving very little lacing.

The aroma is very sweet with malts and plenty of herbal and citrus hops on top, mainly oranges and lemons.  There actually a little bit of alcohol burn in the nostrils as well.

The taste is a bit more complex than the aroma with more herbal hop kick and booze in the finish.  The bready malts form a solid backbone with some citrus hops kick up front and a sweetness that builds between sips.

The mouthfeel is sticky with good soft carbonation and a body on the heavier side of things.  The alcohol isnt completely hidden, but doesnt dominate.

This is a pretty hefty beer for the style with a strong herbal presence as well as a noticeable alcohol kick.  Its not the most drinkable brew but its tasty.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Like HopheadHans said, this is GREAT Pizza beer fitting the Pizza Port tradition. The mouth feel is aggressive and lively with a hint of metallic finish.

810,"2009-03-02",4.2,"Bottle from City Beer.  The sparkling, honey-colored body is hazy and orange-hued.  This mildly effervescent body is topped with a moderate, if not small head of ivory that sticks in rounded splotches and rings on the walls of my pils glass.  The weight of the beer is masked by ample carbonation and has a soft, semi-dry finish.  I smell the sweet aroma of pils yeast, sugared bread dough, citrus, caramel, and notes of pine.  A nice mixture of malts and hops confront you immediately: pine, citrus, sugar, caramel; then the pils yeast steps in, followed by a bitter finish of pine, citrus, wood, some unknown spice, and a touch of roasted-caramel malt.  Notable alcoholic warmth on the finish as it sits a while, which simply enhances the sweet citrus finish (carries a lot of orange and grapefruit rind) and the pils yeast with roasted caramel.  Take a strong ale composed of the pils yeast and the malts of a bock with a touch of roasted malt, but replace the noble hops with something you might expect in a big West Coast IPA and you have the Panzer.  The Panzer is mellow, but well-hopped, and overly drinkable for its ABV...which is really no problem at all.","Reno, Nevada, USA","0o9i"

810,"2008-12-23",3.9,"Pours a transparent bright golden with a clingy-lacing froth of white head.  Aroma of fresh resiny grapefruity hops and some pale malty sweetness.  Body starts with good fullness for the style and a good maltiness with tons of assertive juicy citrusy hops before a crisp, bittersweet finish.  Did not really remind me much of a pilsner, but more of an imperial pale ale. Regardless of style designation, it was pretty tasty.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
810,"2008-12-23",4.2,"hazy shade of orange/golden brownish with a bunch of yeast clumps floating around. it*s capped by a soapy/rocky off white head which leaves lots of descending rings of lace and an enormous amount of spots. 

all kinds of citrus in the aroma!... grapefruit, lemon, lemon grass, ginger, peach, orange, a touch of caramel, some earthy spice and grassy fresh juicy hops fill the profile. 

the palate is sweet but not overly (especially given the 9.4%) while dry and hoppy at the same time. flavors are of wood, grass, earthy spice, malty sweetness/caramel, loads of citrus and their piths with a dry punchy hoppy finish. alcohol is noticed as it warms. it is full bodied but green hoppiness keeps it from becoming cloying. smooth, soft and slick textures from a nice mix of carbonation.

this starts incredibly spicy/citrusy/hoppy on the palate and mid-palate when cold but fades and gets a bit ""dead"" just before it is swallowed as it warms. that*s a negative for me given the fact that this is definitely a sipper...

810,"2008-11-18",4.0,"Pours with a frothy, initially three finger thick, light tan colored head the is held up by a persistent carbonation.  The beer is a lightly copper tinged, deep gold color that shows brilliantly clear, bright gold color when held up to the light.  The aroma is definitely hop focused, though perhaps not quite as whack you in the head expressive as I thought it was going to be (and this is not necessarily a bad thing).  Grassy and lightly herbal up front, the aroma finishes with a fruity tropical fruit note that is a mix of mango, kumquat, lychee and sweet orange zest.  Quite a bit of cracker-like grain character contributes a nice malt profile.

Lightly sweet up front, but soon picks up a nice herbal hop note that turns towards bitter, but then piquantly fruity in the long finish.  I have never had a hoppy beer get bitter and then fruity in the finish; it is quite interesting that the tropical fruit notes are what lingering on the palate.  Up front the herbal hops contribute an almost peppery bite that is something a bit like arugula, with all the sharp herbal note one would expect.  The fruity hop notes are also noticeable up front, it is just that they mix in with the herbal hop notes so are not quite as prominent.  The hop fruit notes lean towards lychee, ripe peach, kumquat and citrus oil, but they intermix quite well with the previously mentioned herbal notes as well as hints of hemp oil, raw-herbal notes and a touch of chive.

I like that this has the crisp character and herbal hop notes of typical Pilsner, yet it has that something else in the background with the fruity hop character that is not so typical.  This is definitely interesting, more quaffable than beer of this strength should be yet (which is good for something with the name Pilsner on the label) with a certain heft and definite palate presence.  Not as abrasive as double IPA; I was expecting this to be more harshly hoppy, but it is not and this is quite nice.  This is actually really good and I am kicking myself all the more that I somehow missed out on Tovarish at GABF.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

810,"2008-10-20",3.7,"On tap at the Saint/Sinner Dinner.  Pours golden yellow with a small white head.  Aroma of citrus and hops.  Flavors were hops and some malt.  Very nice.","Santee","toncatcher"
810,"2008-10-19",3.8,"Draft at the Sinner’s party.   Citrus and hoppy on the aromas with more hops in the flavor.  Very viscous and full in the mouth.  Nice finish of citrus hops.  Very nice beer.","Santee/San Diego, California, USA","fordest"
810,"2008-10-19",4.0,"Tap @ Lost Abbey during the Saint’s and sinner’s party.  Pours orange with a bright white ring.  Nose is light and hoppy.  Taste is really damn nice, a sweet and hoppy pils with tons of taste, nice work julian.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
810,"2008-10-19",3.8,"Tasted at the Sinner party.  Yellow with a fluffy white head.  Very nice fruity aroma and taste with some mellow alcohol notes . Quite good.","Berkeley, California, USA","badlizard"
810,"2008-10-18",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 19, 2008 22oz bottle. This beer rules! Pours brilliant, clearish amber with a medium sized white head, some lace. Smells mellow, light and sweet malty... unassuming. Tastes unbelievably citrusy with just enough aggressive malt sweetness to call it a pilsner. Think bright and sweet hoppy triple ipa only bottom fermented. Bright resiny, orange and lemon with a little bit of melon. FUll body, dry and bitter astringent, good carbonation.","San Diego, California, USA","doubleo"
810,"2008-10-17",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 5, 2009 650 ml bottle from Bev4less. Pours a cloudy dark yellow with a small off-white head. Lots of floatie chunks in the bottom of the bottle. The aroma is complex with sweet breads, yeast, allspice a touch of citrus and alcohol.  The flavor is a bit confused--this beer does not know if it want s to be a sweet beer or a hoppy beer. There are strong elements of both, also in the taste I get peanuts, allspice, oranges and again there is that bit of alcohol. The mouthfeel is well balanced and malty. The finish is long with lingering sweet hops. Overall: A very original brew. Very addictive. Recommended.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"
810,"2008-10-16",3.8,"Bomber.  Pours a cloudy gold with some floaters and a one finger dense white head that results in spotty lacing.  Nose is sweet citrus, biscuity yeast and malt.  Taste is sweet malt and yeast upfront with ripe tangerines and oranges coming into play.  Some alcohol spiked grapefruit finishes it out and the tartness lingers for quite awhile.  Medium, creamy mouth feel.  I liked this a lot.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","Sparky"
810,"2008-10-15",3.7,"bottle from PPs Shop in Carlsbad: funny label! aroma unlike expectations; hard, sweet, yeasty, and hot; banana, peach, mango--tropical essence, i assume; good and oddly smooth--hard, but quaffable; i liked it a lot.","Petaluma, California, USA","steview"
810,"2008-10-15",3.9,"Bottle from Pacific Park Market in Aliso Viejo.
Hazy golden pour with a white head. Nice aroma and a complex flavor. This was easy drinking. The abv was well-hidden and snuck up on me later","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
810,"2008-10-13",3.8,"Bottle from South Bay Drugs.  Poured a rich, light amber/dark ruddy gold.  Off white head.  Aroma of yeast, almost belgian, sweet malt, bread; herbal/spice.  Agree completely with wetherel’s description of the aroma a few ratings below.  Flavor was sweet and pretty hot still.  alcohol wasn’t overly detracting however.  I’m not an expert of the style, but this doesn’t seem like an example of it.  Still it was pretty tasty.  The hop flavor could have been tastier, but the sweet, sugary malt was enjoyable.  Prefer the Sam Adams version, but this was still good.","Branson, Missouri, USA","alexanderj"
810,"2008-10-13",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2008 22 oz bottle from Beverages 4 Less in Santee. Some yeast and sweetness. A little dry and boozy. But good none the less. Another home run by Port. I mean who else does an imperial pilsner? The day was perfect for this. No work on a hot blustery fall like day in Southern California. 

Re-Rate- Met the maker of this recipe. A guy named Julian dubbed the best Brewer nobody knows by Mr. T. Arthur of Port Brewing. I also sampled some of Julians home brews. The Sour he had was excellent. How does a homebrewer produce a sour that blows away most proffesionals? Somebody get this guy into the business. I have had the pilsner several times now and I believe this style needs more representatives.","(San Diego) Santee, California, USA","padrefan98"
810,"2008-10-13",3.7,"Tasted from tap at Lost Abbey.  Yellow amber color.  Interesting aroma.  Kind of like it has corriander in it, or it’s brewed at high temps, or a saison yeast or something.  Unexpected in a pilsner, but an imperial pilsner...maybe.  No skunky Saaz. Sweet.  Easy to drink.  Good.   I’m not sure if imperial pilsner describes the beer well.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
810,"2008-10-12",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2009 Really solid brew.  Strong lager is noted?  Seemed more like an Ale.  Great aroma, strong pils flavor and Germanesk.  Lots of minerals and a strong rustic and bitter finish.  After this opened up it was more intense.  These would benefit from 6-12 months of bottle age.  Tried from Bomber.

Update, enjoyed bottle 2 with 4 moths of age, drinking at its peak, the little bit of bottle age helped this really come around.  Score improves and this felt like a german beer brewed in germany.  outstanding!",", California, USA","paytoplay"
810,"2008-10-11",4.2,"Sampled from the tap at Port Brewing on Friday night . The perfect way to celebrate the end of the week and start the weekend. The boyz were busy bottling and holding down the fort while the rest were at GABF,so we had the hard task of sampling this brew. Golden in color with a thin white head. Subtle citrus aroma. Medium resin like body with some enticing carbonation. Great flavor of bitter hops and balanced complex maltiness. Very long finish with lasting flavor in your mouth. Excellent beer no doubt!!!","encinitas, California, USA","nightrider"
