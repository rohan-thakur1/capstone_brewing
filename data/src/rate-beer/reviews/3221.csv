3221,"2017-06-11",2.7,"Very hoppy, so much so that is very difficult to think of this as a pilsner or a lager. Not particularly refreshing. Its definitely a decent beer, but not sure when Id opt for it.","Stretford, Greater Manchester, ENGLAND","tmdaines"
3221,"2017-06-04",2.5,"330ml can from Tesco Extra, Watford. Hazy pour, with some grassy hop notes. Quite an astringent bitterness, almost soapy. Not bad, but not all that great, and lacking in drinkability.","Watford, Hertfordshire, ENGLAND","Beese"
3221,"2017-05-25",3.4,"Pleasantly surprising for a Pilsner. Fully fruited with strange marmite at the back of the throat. Odd but cool.","Birmingham, West Midlands, ENGLAND","sonofian"
3221,"2017-05-17",3.7,"Can from Tesco (yes Tesco) Bicester, Oxon. Consumed at home Wednesday 17th May 2017  This is a lovely fruity pilsner, really enjoying this. Ok so its not as crisp as some pilsners and it might not be entirely true to style (though I am just guessing on this point), but I really like this. The hops lift this and add another layer, this is a clean, fruity, refreshing and fab beer and nice to see unconventional hops used.

3221,"2017-05-03",3.0,"Can, 330ml. A pale straw colour with a large white head. Strong aroma of fresh hops, citrus, coriander, quite sweet. Flavour is sweet, hoppy and a little bitter with butter, caramel, a herbal note, some underlying malt. Moderate carbonation. Im not sure about this, its rather sweet for my taste.","Greater London, ENGLAND","dj"
3221,"2017-05-02",3.0,"Oh Yes! A bright, light marmalade colour with a bountiful light blonde foamy head.
Nose is a tropical citrus and I assume lychees (I haven't tasted them for ages)
Mouthfeel is a bit thin and medium carbonation but suits it's crisp freshness. 
Upfront grapefruit then quickly flowing in is the balancing slightly sweet ""lychee"" note all then melting into the pithy citrus peel backend which has an extended life of its own. 

I was surprised by the modern twist in this drink, for me it's more of a light IPA with a counter balancing sweet note that worked refreshingly well.","Nottinghamshire, ENGLAND","Onesimus"
3221,"2017-05-01",2.3,"330ml can from Tesco. Thin dry fizzy beer with some modern hops. Its drinkable but boring, unless you like the flavour of hops. Even then, there are better ways of displaying hops than in such a dull beer.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"
3221,"2017-04-29",3.3,"Can, Tesco online. Slightly hazy amber tinted golden beer, big billowing white head. Very fruity aroma, citrus and berries. Similar flavour, soft bitterness, fruity hops, hint of sweetness from malts. As a beer, nice and I enjoyed it, but calling it a Yakima pils is not hugely helpful - if youre expecting either a crisp dry pils or a load of old school craft piney bitter C hops then it doesnt deliver - in fact its pretty similar to their APA (maybe just different yeast and a lagering period?) so I dont see what it adds to the range.","Greater London, ENGLAND","JorgeLee"
3221,"2017-04-22",3.3,"Can, Tesco, Wigston. Hazy golden with a large foam. Toasted grain with light tropical fruit and a citrus bitterness. Some dank grassiness. Peppery dry finish. Decent pilsner.","Wigston, Leicestershire, ENGLAND","leaparsons"
3221,"2017-04-07",2.7,"Clear yellow brown with minimal head. Hoppy aroma, a bit lemony. Very hoppy flavor, a bit sharp on the front and bitter behind, ending with a flavor like burnt peanuts. Fizzy. Its okay.","Durham, Durham, ENGLAND","sarauckelman"
3221,"2017-04-07",3.0,"Clear, golden. Foamy white head. Bitter grapefruit flavor. Medium body. Dry. Not bad.","Durham, ENGLAND","uckelman"
3221,"2017-04-03",3.3,"Gold thin head how a proper lager should taste no corn no syrup no metal notes clean and crisp hint of pepper","Greater Manchester, ENGLAND","redders1974"
3221,"2017-04-01",3.4,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2017 330ml can: wOWE this is spicy, malty and just a bit juxtaposed . these guys have made  two pretty decent stabs @ pils that ive liked  thus far","Brentford, Greater London, ENGLAND","Gary"
3221,"2017-03-29",3.4,"Pours mostly clear golden with aggressive white head. Aromas of saaz hops with a good bunch of apple/grape hoppy notes too. Slight herbal spice, like Sorachi Ace evident too. High carbonation andreasonable mouth feel. Clean, crisp malt taste with a big Nelson Sauvin white wine flavour and some peach. The herbal spice is evident at the end too before the dry semi-bitter finish. Very good stuff. Perhaps a touch more bitterness could elevate this.","Tyne & Wear, ENGLAND","allanmb"
3221,"2017-03-29",2.4,"Can. Beer Stop, Dronfield. Dark gold. Not much in the way of a head. Nose has paper. Rubbery malts. Hint of hop. Some grass. Compost. Taste is sickly sweet, and jarring, vegetal bitter. Flabby mouthfeel. Acrid bitter finish. Grim.","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"
3221,"2017-03-26",4.3,"Live rating of a 330ml can from Tesco Gateshead, cooled in the fridge, and poured into a 1/2 pint chalice. As soon as the can was opened, there were tropicals in the air. Beautiful golden body with a thin white skim. In a simple act of genius, we have the juicy topicality of Yakima hops introduced to the sharp cleanliness of pilsner, kicking all blandness aside. If I ever found this on draught, its likely I would cancel everything and drink myself into a filthy mess. Best beer since yesterdays Tiny Rebel and my current favourite beer in the world Bit of mint in the finish.","Tyne & Wear, ENGLAND","Martin243"
3221,"2017-03-18",3.4,"Can from our Cotteridge wines; clear golden yellow pour with a big bubbly off white head, aroma has pine and other tropics, taste has some vegetation and spice, tropical hop coming through, ok stuff.","Birmingham, West Midlands, ENGLAND","RichTheVillan"
3221,"2017-03-09",3.5,"8th March 2017Can. Bright clear gold beer, good pale cream colour head. Palate is light, mildly dry and has reasonable fine carbonation. Light and mildly sweet malts. Modest bubblegum esters. Mild hop spice. Very light citric hop. Light finish but suffers a bit after drinking Vocations Dirty Pilsner, feels mildly staid.",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"
3221,"2017-03-05",3.3,"330ml can. Pours gold with a large head. Aroma is tropical fruit juice. Taste has crisp lager malts to start and a light tropical juice finish.","Dudley, West Midlands, ENGLAND","tommann"
3221,"2017-02-10",3.4,"Keg @ Drink? Hebden Bridge. Golden with a small head. Has a sweetened tropical fruit taste, good aroma, with some activity in the palate.","Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire, ENGLAND","ManVsBeer"
