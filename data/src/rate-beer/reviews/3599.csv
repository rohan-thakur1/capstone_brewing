Translucent, slightly cloudy amber-brown with a lasting bit of off-white fine-bubbled foam...fruity, resinous, somewhat earthy aroma, touches of dried hops...dry and earthy in the body, lightly peppery, some sweeter, juicier touches show up with time though it remains just a touch too dry for me...notes say ""toasted bread but no marmalade"" what the hell? anyway, strong tingly carbonation is a bit strong also...this was served too cold and improved quite a bit over a long tasting with some warmth; I look forward to trying it again now that I can get the commoner Surlys pretty easily.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

3599,"2014-10-12",3.1,"Id probably call this an APA rather than a bitter but I dont feel like arguing so whatever. This is a slightly cloudy orange beer w/ a head of white, fine bubbles. It smells really nice and fruity, definite peach and tangerine notes. It is a touch on the bland side when you taste it though, no real malt character comes through and its just a firm bit of bitterness in the finish. I think this might work OK as a light, refreshing beer but the texture is a bit full bodied for that. It drinks pretty easily w/ its mild carbonation but feels a bit too oily on the tongue for something that doesnt have much depth of flavor. I dont mind this stuff but I dont see myself buying it again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

3599,"2014-06-06",2.4,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2015 This is an updated review of the 2015 version of Bitter Brewer. This beer has been a favorite for several years, but this years example is hugely disappointing. No, not just disappointing; it is a major departure in the thin hop water direction of session ales. Ive kept my former review & numerical ratings below for anyone who is interested. My current ratings are what is reflected in this review. I sincerely hope Surly reconsiders their direction for this beer.

Hazy orange. White head, dissipates quickly, little/no lacing. Faint somewhat citrusy aroma. If the dry hopping was for aroma, it didnt do much. Initial taste is mild, transitioning to a very bitter, piney, orangy, borderline unpleasant aftertaste that hangs around much too long. So long, in fact, the astringent bitterness is still there long after I would like to take another drink. Mouth feel is thin, watery. Overall, this is a significant step backwards for what used to be one of my favorites. Im unlikely to buy it again.

Old review with rating:
A bit too high in hop bitterness to be a true English-style bitter, but otherwise, it is faithful to the style. I wish this was a year-round offering from Surly.

Very even bitterness all the way across the tongue. A very bready almost rye like as well sweetness hits after the initial hop burst before fading into the bitterness as well.

Mouthfeel is very fairly light with good carbonation levels. Very easy drinking beer.

3599,"2013-08-08",3.4,"A hazy golden color with a touch of brown/orange. Finger of white head. Smells orange, apricot, some hoppy notes but a little subtle, other citrus smells as well, lemon. Taste is a little bitter, not much sweetness, some cracker/bread, orange, pretty tame flavors overall, a little watered down tasting. Not bad though, a decent drinker.

3599,"2011-11-24",4.0,"I received a 16oz can in a trade with a friend in Minnesota. I poured it into an English nonic pint glass.

Appearance: Hazy, tarnished orange hue but with plenty of visible carbonation. Forms a small, white, frothy head. Average retention and lacing.

Smell: Amazing hop presence with light citrus and flowers - almost like a perfume. Subtle sweet malty and confectionary notes buried underneath. 

Taste: Im always amazed when a brewery can do more with less and when brewers (usually Americans) can put entirely new spins on classic styles. Surly Bitter Brewer does both simultaneously: it doesnt forget its roots, yet it doesnt apologize for its overtly American qualities.

Usually light beers with strong hop presence tend to taste like hop water, but this one is a lot different. Sweet citrusy hop flavors begin and end the palate, yet it is not dry or bitter (only 37 IBUs). The English bitter palate is revealed throughout the middle with a strong flavor of grain, cereals, and red fruits. Its a juicy taste with a strong orange and apricot marmalade taste. The hops bookend the palate with a light citrus taste, and keep the fruit theme going without becoming distracting or cloying. 

Mouthfeel: Surprisingly thick and full-bodied, but it lacks the intensity and deadweight of a stronger beer. Mostly calm, but some noticeable carbonation. A short, pleasant aftertaste of jelly but for the most part its clean.

Drinkability: Its rare I find an American beer I could honestly see myself drinking for hours on end, but Surly Bitter Brewer is definitely such a beer. With a delectable palate of genuine taste that doesnt overwhelm and a comfortable mouthfeel and smooth, clean finish its the epitome of drinker-friendly. Its not strong enough to stand up to a hearty meal, but as the pub beer its meant to emulate it does the job perfectly.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Found a single 4pk of this hiding in the liquor store the other day (2/14/2011)! No date. Accompanying my stir-fry lunch.

Appearance:
a golden-orange, pretty much clear. Little visible carbonation. A finger of head at first, but it disappeared leaving no lacing.

Smell:
Fruity, kind of reminds me of mango or pineapple, like fresh tropical fruit juice. Sweet and tangy aromas.

Taste:
Maltiness gets you first, which gives way to a dryish pineapple flavor. Despite the smell, not really sweet at all. Taste gives way to a pleasant and balanced bitterness, again reminding me of pineapple.

Mouthfeel:
Feels like fruit juice, but it doesnt stick to you like orange juice does. Very clean and crisp.

Drinkability:
Super-high. This tastes refreshing, smells refreshing, just feels refreshing. Right now Im drinking it to rebel against winter, which pretty much says that its a fantastic summer beer.

Oddly enough, I didnt care for this beer as much when I first tried it last July. Maybe my palette just needed some development, because now I think this one is fantastic.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

I suppose the loads of malt help categorize this as an ESB, but to me it reads more like a fresh harvest IPA.  Good, but I had visions of Bitch Creek and this came across similar to Sierra Nevada Harvest.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","bblack99"

3599,"2011-03-06",4.5,"16 oz can.

Pours a med-dark amber/gold with a soapy white head that dissipates quickly.

The smell is fruity and lightly hopped with a malty backbone.

The taste has a bit more citrus than normal, a bit yeasty note, some ok malts, not my favorite though. Not any bitterness at all.

Its a good session beer, a flavorful one at that. Probably the best session beer if you stick by the ""4%"" hard rule.

I had 3 more of these, and I totally appreciate this brew so much more, just fantastic.

Dull orange-gold, very thin head, looks flat but expected for style.

Citrus due to dry-hopping, leading to a stronger smell than typical for style. Also, faint malts detected.

Clean toasted, tea-like malt taste balanced by metallic hop bitterness. Light citrus flavor that is less evident in the taste than smell.

Low carbonation, firm and dry. This is where most American attempts fall short; Surly nailed it.

The use of American hops leave this some distance from being a traditional British bitter - but given the general standard of canned British bitters, that may not be such a bad thing.

Foam settles to a rocky head as I write this. Certainly the hoppiest tasting ESB I’ve found in my relatively few tastes of this style. A more grassy taste of fresh hops in the front of the tongue, basic bitterness in the back. Yet the malt base seems to me a little lacking. Sure, that’s partly due to its lower alcohol, but it kind of turns watery and metallic. A few other raters noted this, I see, and put it down to being served too cold, and I did pull this from the fridge. I can’t bring myself to rate this too highly for now, but I have more I can try under different conditions.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

3599,"2008-09-09",3.9,"The sixteen ounce can comfortable pours into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip glass with a frothy, initially two-finger thick pale tan colored head.  The beer is a full amber hue that shows a lightly hazed, red tinged, dark copper color when held up to the light.  The aroma is nice an punchy with hop notes of ruby-red grapefruit, vibrant orange zest and a substantial, toasty, biscuit like malt character.  It is quite interesting how much this smells like orange marmalade, the hop character is just so nice and definitely hits the spot (and I haven’t even tasted this yet).

A little too cold still (near 40°F / 4.5°C), this tastes of lemons and hop bitterness.  As it slowly warms the hop-citrus flavors become a bit fuller, with notes leaning a bit more towards grapefruit.  This beer is quite dry, which is not unexpected considering the strength.  A touch more malt sweetness might accent the hop fruit character a bit more, but I like how light and quaffable this is right now.  There is just enough malt sweetness to this though to make the overall hop effect just fruity enough; touches of lychee, sweet grapefruit, ripe tangerine and some flowery peach notes all get more and more noticeable as this beer opens up.  The malt is not quite as assertively aggressive as it was in the aroma, but still there are substantial flavors of biscuit-like malt, and pale toasted grain that add complexity to this brew.

This is just too easy to drink.  The aroma is fantastic and I wish the flavor was a little more assertive, but this definitely needs to be on the warm side of 50°F / 10°C to be fully experienced properly.  I would kill to have this on hand pulled cask for a pint or five in a row.  This is a very good beer, that really would be at its best as a real ale; I would love to have that, but I know that is never going to happen.  Way before I want it to happen, this beer has disappeared from my glass.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3599,"2008-08-18",3.6,"This will be my attempt to satisfy Ross guidelines for a proper rating entry.  Grimreeser was passing through Nashville and decided to stop by for a tasting and to do some trades. I decided to try this beer as I sat in my kitchen, planning for my upcoming business trip. This is a 16 ounce can, 4% alcohol and 35 Ibus. I do not have the born on date- sorry. This pours into my IPA tulip glass a slightly hazy amber, about 12 lovibond (under flourescent lighting) with a 2 1/8"" pale yellow beige head. This head took about 4 minutes to dissipate into a 3/16"" head, and left webby lacing. This has a nice fruity nose, with notes of exotic fruits like apricot, tangerine, and pineapple. The has light to medium body, but with a thin texture and soft to average carbonation. Initial flavor of iced tea, caramel, and toffee that quickly transitions to a very sharp grassy and spicy bitterness. Finish is hoppy and dry with a lingering pepper bite at the back of the mouth, which seems to subside as the beer reach about 50 degrees. Very dry and overly bitter for a typical British ESB. Perhaps a cask version could smooth this out a tad, but this is worth trying.

The nose is heavy on piney hops and orange marmalade, with a toasty caramel malt backbone and drying grains.  Flavors include resinous pine hops, bitter orange, sweet, toasty pale malts, and dry grassiness.  The finish is bone dry, with lingering bitterness, which makes you want more and more.  Slightly less than medium bodied and moderately carbonated, I could sit and drink this all day long.  Excellent summertime session beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Medium amber orange with a thin white head and some light lacing.  Smell is big hops and dough.  Flavor is hoppy but not fruity or floral or too terribly refreshing.  Medium to high carbonation.  Drinkable and hoppy just not very crisp or springy like I hoped.  Big honey flavors linger.","Austin, Texas, USA","pintsize"

I also pick up a bit of iced tea. Copper colored with a smallish off white head. The flavor is peach-a-plenty with a little earthiness, faint dark caramel, whole wheat crackers, and some other lighter fruits. This is different than any beer I have ever tried with the unique hop profile and I must say I am digging it. The finish is bitter, but not overly so. The mouthfeel is amazing for such a small beer. I must admit, this is the nice grain bill of a premium bitter, but with a distinctly non-English hop profile, but also not really a typical American hop profile.

Pours a nice mostly clear golden color with a creamy medium lived beige head.  Smell is fresh mildly floral hops and oaty, nutty, creamy malt.

Floral and herbal hops hit initially and are backed up by some toasted and lightly fruity malts. Some hops in the finish leave a light bitter effect lingering on the tongue. Seemed pretty light, had nice carbonation, and was a pleasure to drink. It proves that beers don’t have to be aged in a bourbon barrell and be 14% in order to be good.

Soft is the word that keeps coming to my head.  Very nice smell of mango and some peach with a definite toasty maltiness underneath.  I can usually tell what kind of hops are used but this is confusing me.  Amarillo maybe? (Note: This review was written before I read the description and found out it is Glacier).

The hops were a bit tart and balanced out well with the sweetness of the caramel malts.  Mouthfeel is medium and very (you guessed it) bitter with strong carbonation.

3599,"2008-05-23",3.7,"16oz Can. Thanks for bringing this back Jake! Orange rind, whole wheat toast, and light goat barn blend with a sweet figure of very grassy, yet lightly resin-filled hops. Bright and filled with a fresh summer breeze. Pours a clearish, brown-tinted orange with a tall soapy white head. Flavor is a little flaccid and oily. The malts come as crystal and filtered. Theres a tangy orange rind sensation, but then a woody blast of grainy hops. A bit biting, but the grassiness of the hops comes across as refreshing and light. The malt is a bit goaty and animal-like, but it holds up well to the hops. This is hoppy and bitter, with good hop flavors, but maybe a little too bitter, for bitterness sake. Anyway, it leaves a long sweetgrass, grapefruit rind, and bergamot soak on the tongue. Interesting. Initially, Im a little perplexed and let down by some of the malt flavors, but they clean up a little and the tremendous hoppiness just shines in a basking fruit and grass glow that only Surly can pull off. And for that, this is a good beer.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Pours a slightly hazy, deep, tarnished orange color; fizzy, light-tan head with large bubbles; solid retention and light lacing. The aroma is quite earthy overall, with a malt character somewhere between Marris Otter-like and a very light crystal malt, with the core note being soft tea; gently aromatic hop character: earthy, citrus, and floral notes, but non-astringent and not roughly bitter at all; just a touch watery, or seemingly watery, as this is so softly presented. Medium-light body; medium (or less) carbonation; non-astringent; slightly more bitterness than the aroma suggests: earthy, citrus, and floral (again); very soft, rounded hop character; overall, nothing biting or astringent. The malt core is very quiet: tea-like, lightly earthy, again Marris Otter-like but not quite; just a touch of wateriness in the presentation; this is a passable rendition, and a very nice, rounded hop character, but very quiet and (again) a touch watery.

Medium mouthfeel: touch of wateriness at the edges, but crisp earthy and biscuity hops and chewy, doughy maltiness; decent and quite drinkable stuff, but lacking in body and a touch messy.  Decent hop character.  Medium finish: dry bready notes and a bit of earthy bitterness at the far end. 7.4.7.3.12=3.3","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

3599,"2008-05-20",3.5,"biscuits, honey, marmalade and oats in the nose, along with a hint of hop bitterness. The flavor is kind of strange - the hop bitterness hits the tongue immediately, but then the flavor (in its entirety, malts, hops, everything) is gone a second later. This makes the beer very drinkable, and very refreshing, but also kind of a tease. Decent enough, but not Surlys best effort.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","crowderm"
3599,"2008-05-18",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 19, 2008 16oz can.  Thanks Guerde.  Very interesting beer here.  Yeah, its all kinds of bitter but it vanishes as soon as you taste it, which is good. Plenty of fresh tasting varietal hops in here.  Warrior, eh?  I might have to give them a shake.  Nice session ale, though the bitterness would not make it an all day affair.  Another good ale from Surly.","La Mesa, California, USA","Bartzilla"

Confusing, but tasty.","I F&ckin hate those guys from, Ohio, USA","Rogueone"
3599,"2008-05-16",3.6,"On cask at Maproom. Amber pour with medium sudsy head. Aroma is american hops, citrusy grapefruit forward. I agree with 17th floor in the aroma not carrying over so much to the flavor. Flavor is much more english. Herbal and floral hop flavors, a somewhat grassy bitterness, and just a hint of the citrus detected in the nose. Hop driven for sure. Very smooth session beer.

Not extremely malty, nor hoppy, but still manages that English cheeriness.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

3599,"2008-05-08",3.5,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2012 [Can, thanks Guerde] Pours dark amber with a decent khaki head. Aroma is not a surprise, as it is big on fresh hops. The description is pretty accurate, with the most noticeable aromas being apricot (strongest) and peach. There are also a good amount of malt in the background. The taste is much more malt dominant   Good mouthfeel, smooth and with a lightly citrusy and fairly dry, bitter finish. The taste is somewhat weak, but I wasnt expecting a flavor bomb with this beer anyways. Pretty solid and definitely would be a good session beer. Ill revisit this rating when I have had more bitters to compare it to. Re-rate: Just taking it down a tenth of a point. More tea in the taste, but less hoppy than I remembered it overall. Still smells great. Old rating: 8/3/7/4/14 = 3.6Re-rate: Aroma is huge on lemon iced tea, with a little playdough present as well. Lots of tea in the taste--this beer seems to get more tea dominant each time I have it. Mild bitterness in the taste, with lots of lemon iced tea again, and some peach. I remember this as being better. The taste has grown on me, but the aroma is a little worse than I remember. Overall, this isnt a bad beer by any means, but Im slightly less impressed each time I have it.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"
3599,"2008-05-08",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 4, 2009 (can) Pours amber with a white head that settles to a fine film with decent lacing.  Aroma is strong with fruit. The noted orange and apricot are the most evident, but also a hint of pine, and an underlying earthiness that occurs near the end of the sniff which intensifies as the beer warms.  A really pleasant smell here.  Sadly, the taste did not live up to the aroma.  The flavor begins with just a very light sweetness, that is almost immediately replaced by a clean and dry lemon/grapefruit rind finish.  Medium mouthfeel.  I havent had many bitters, but this one would definitely be a decent session beer.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

Tap at Kumas, 6/27/8. Very nice beer with some oaty caramel tastes. Pour is copper with a fluffy head. Compared to the cask version, this has a lot more going on. I suspect the cask we had was still green. This is a damn fine sessionable beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"

The flavor is of clean tasting malt with some sweetness, orange marmalade, and hops.  All very mild and bready/fruity.  The palate is light and refreshing.  Good, but pretty mild and middle of the road for these guys.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"

Aroma gets slightly skunky as it warms.  Light bodied and drinkable.  Flavor is pretty much green, bitter hops that come off a little astringent along with a faint hint of citrus.

3599,"2007-06-25",3.8,"Well, I see from the ratings being all over the board here that some love it, hate it, or are somewhere in the middle.  I would be in that middle group.  There is a honey, apricot, and grapefruit scent to this bitter.  The taste is bitter, yet not overly so.  A clean finish.  Slightly watered down, but what can I expect when this was followed by two 10%+ monsters previously.  Still, this would be a nice session beer any day of the week.

-------Ta from a can May, 2008.  Much better.  Fairly dry and very drinkable but loaded with hops.  The only thing ESB about it is the name, as it is much too intense to fit in that style.  Good palate now and some fruity hops.  Score raised considerably.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
3599,"2007-06-18",1.8,"On Tap at Old Chicago in Uptown.  I really like all of the other Surly brews Ive had, and I really wanted to try this one-off since Im not in Minneapolis all that often.  I really wanted to like it, because I really like this brewery... But there was just no way.  It had OK head retention and it was cloudy, which I dont mind at all.  It was very low carbonation.. Under 2.5 volumes, Id say, which is appropriate for this style.. But it was sour and dry - it tasted infected actually.    I could sense vague hints of wonderful hops and those awesome british heirloom 2-row malts behind everything, but some wild yeast or bacteria strain had found its way in and ruined it.  I bet this tasted awesome when it was fresh.. The kegs too old, not stored properly, or theres contamination issues going on.  I pounded it anyways, cuz I dont like to waste craft beer.. and then happily ordered a Furious.  Aint the first time Ive had craft beer that had turned, and sadly it probably wont be the last.  Just a reminder that proper sanitation, storage, transport and cellaring are really so important.  Keep dialing it in Surly, Ill always try your brews when Im in Minneapolis.","Oakland, California, USA","nahthan"
3599,"2007-06-14",3.6,"Yellow/orange/red, this falls somewhere in there. Lots of hoppy aromas, with a lot of grapefruit and citrus like aromas.

3599,"2007-06-07",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2007 Two pint glasses on tap at Macs Industrial Sports Bar in Nordeast Minneapolis. Wonderful, hoppy, sweetly fruity and remarkably floral aroma features apricot, grapefruit, and peach scents (by the way, I wrote that before reading the commercial description). Pours a hazy, sparkling brass with a small amount of off-white head. Very appetizing appearance. The flavor is dominated by good, solid, adventurous American hops. The taste matches the smell, with a heavy pitted fruit presence. Bitter brewer is very hoppy and far from well-balanced. Take away the hops, and this is a forgettable beer. But why would you ever take away the hops? Theyre awesome! Bitter hops aftertaste. Medium body. Stunning crispness that I have experienced before only in the best lagers and never in another ale. 

<P>Surly has done it again! This is my kind of beer! It has less malty goodness than Furious but even better hops. I have scored all four Surly beers that I have tried well into the fours. Honestly, I was hoping that I would not have liked this beer and would have been forced to have given it a bad review, because I do not want to come across as a homer. But, like Bender, Furious, and Darkness, it is just so damn good that I cant help but give it another rave. I just cant help but love this beer. I do echo badgerben in saying that, despite the name, I would classify this as an American pale ale rather than any variety of bitter.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

3599,"2007-05-19",4.0,"Lightly hazed apricot marmalade appearance...no kiddin...under a crisp, creamy white head...really, crisp and creamy...this is so far, one of the paler Surlys yet (maybe Cynic was lighter?), but the least alcoholic, for sure. (4.2%)

orange/ apricot marmalade dominates the aroma, also...fresh with citric zest...pithy, zippy...and a little sticky...

Taste: big bitter blast, tangy and tart, then nothing but refreshment. Easy drinking ale, this, crisp, snappy, light bodied, but full of testure, flavor and character. Bitter lemon rind feel keeps creeping into the palate.Then it fades back, with the hoppy kick still hanging on.

Interesting. Very much like a smooth, light ESB, but with that special something you get from the hops we grow on this continent. I am liking this, a great late spring sessioner.

Once again, an utterly unique, new creation from Surly. Keep em coming , guys!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
3599,"2007-05-13",3.7,"Tap at the Muddy Pig.  Clear, flowery blonde color.  Crisp hops dominate the nose - mandarin and orange and a punch of pineapple.  Tastes distinctively British with its honey biscuit and grass body.  Highlighted with accents of little lilac flower hops and some papery crystal notes.  Trace of toffee hard candy on the smack.  Palate approaches aggression cautiously and never quite arrives.  Obviously, an interesting sessioner.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
3599,"2007-05-11",4.2,"Sampled on tap the day after the unveiling at the Old Chicago Uptown in Minneapolis, MN. Shared beer with brewfiend and scluffman. Pours a hazy pale golden brew with a thick white head that dissoved to a fine film on top. Excellent lacing. Aroma has scents of pine hops, orange peel, and some pitted fruit. Taste is lightly carbonated, smooth with the hop bitterness that makes this a true Premium Bitter. The finish is smooth and dry with a small hop bite, but not as over the top like Surly Furious. I can not call this beer as Furious Light because I consider ""Light Beers"" as diet beers. Surly Bitter Brewer is most appropriate name. According to Omar, only one batch was made.
