2937,"2016-10-25",3.7,"Drinks smooth, very appealing taste. Not too sweet. Pours a thick opaque purple, not sticky on the tongue. Super good showing from Finnriver Cidery, definitely pick this one up.","Dallas, Texas, USA","Intricate08"

2937,"2016-08-21",3.7,"Tap. Dark purple with large pink head. Massive lavender aroma. Flavor smooth currany and lavender. High sweetness but the herbaceousness keeps it from being cloying.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"
2937,"2016-07-31",4.3,"Truly wonderful, lovely sweetness and berry flavors with the nice savory and spice of the lavender, well mixed.","Portland, Oregon, USA","stchloe"
2937,"2016-07-24",4.5,"Delightful. Solid all around. Subtle yet present lavender blends with the tart currants and a typical cidery finish. This is fantastic stuff.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","Btbeers"
2937,"2016-06-26",3.4,"On tap at PIB 2016, pours a deep dark pinkish mahogany with a small pink head. Aroma brings out loads of black currant, with a touch of lavender - very jam. Flavour is super jammy, with loads of black currant, followed by subtle lavender, and medium sweetness. Super jammy with moderate-high sweetness on the finish. Nice stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2937,"2016-05-10",3.5,"Shared 16.9 oz. bottle at Lunar Brewing Co., poured to snifters showing a clear mahogany color, with a modest layer of head foam that diminished rapidly to a bubbly ring, and light spots of lacing. The nose was pomander-like, floral & spice hints, with esters as dark cherry, raisin, and of course, apple. Medium bodied, and fairly carbonated, the taste was notes as the aromas, sweet, and pleasantly tart. Maybe a touch of grandmas bathroom, but I liked the expressive fruitiness.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
2937,"2016-05-03",4.1,"Bottle. Pours clear ruby magenta, small pink head, some lacing. Aroma is huge currant, apples, hints of must. Flavor is fairly sweet, medium fruity tartness as well, green apple, currant, cherry, cranberry, just a hint of must. Medium body, fairly low carbonation. This is pretty damn good, actually.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
2937,"2016-02-29",3.4,"(Draught) Pours a clear rose body. Aroma of berries, apple, and lavender. Flavor of apple, black current, apple, and florals.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
2937,"2015-08-18",3.4,"Draft - Blackcurrent, like a wine gum. Deep ruby. Dry blackcurrents, laveder and again very dry and sweet.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2937,"2015-07-13",3.5,"bottle, lots of sweetness as expected, sweet and flowery. The tartness from teh currants adds a great complexity to it.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
2937,"2015-02-13",3.3,"[Tap] Sampled at Cider Summit Chicago 2015. Labeled Black Current Cider. Purple in color with a pink-tinged head on top. Aromas of fruit jelly, juicy currants and only fleeting hints of apple. Flavors follow the nose closely. For some reason, I got hints of grape jelly mixed in with apple juice. Sweet and juicy overall. Would have liked to see this drier, but still nicely done.","Illinois, USA","troyc"
2937,"2014-10-06",3.5,"Bottle from the Beer Authority.
Rich garnet pour, very little head. Big berry nose -- think mixed-berry pie -- and if you hunt for it theres also an off-aroma wrapped up in the lavender, as if someone pooped in the potpourri. Flavor is basically juicy black currant, lavender hints, tart but not entirely dry, tannic in the close. Quite similar to their regular black currant cider in that respect.  A bit of the funky apple that characterizes the other E. K. Swan ciders. Tasty stuff in a fruit-juice sort of way, and while somehow ""easier"" than the others in the series its a plenty nice concoction.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2937,"2014-07-18",4.0,"Bottle. Pours, amazingly enough, a lavender color, with plenty of carbonation, and an aroma of mostly black currant. Im sure launder is in there too, but I get mostly black currant. Taste leans fairly sweet, and consists of black currant, but nicely balanced with some tartness. Finishes with the flavors all lingering on the palate. I like that the currant flavor is up front rather than hiding in the background, but you do have to be up for a cider that is on the sweeter side to enjoy this. Ill have it again for sure.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"
