2878,"2016-10-12",4.0,"(2014 version on tap @ Warpigs HF Day, Copenhagen, May 12 2016) Pours a medium amber with almost no head. Aroma of red berries, caramel, sweet grape, stewed fruit, a sort of sweet-tart blend with some wood and funk lying over it. Flavour is sweet and kind of acidic, like a drier fortified wine, with toasty oak, bitter grain, sour grape, and a dry hay and funk barnyard character. Finish is rather tannic, dry and woody with a bit of grain, and lingering tart fruit notes. Medium body, lightly oily feel, soft carbonation. A bit hard to get into at first, with charms that reward some patience.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

2878,"2015-07-31",4.6,"2015 bottle drunk 7/24/15.A brilliant, rich amber hued beer showing good clarity and topped by an off-white head that shows strong retention.Wow. Not to take anything away from the flavors, but Ill be damned if HF dosent have some of the most aromatically pleasing beers out there. After the disappointing incredibly over-barreled SP Saison du Ble, the wonderfully balanced and integrated barrel character in the nose here, was supremely refreshing. Soft, aged red wine character, minerals, light chalk and very low tannin character all build complexity, as dry toffee and brown bread-like malts creep in from the edges, adding just a touch of sweetness and allowing the wild character to present itself cleanly and clearly. Limes, hickory, cobwebby cellar, mild lactic influences and peppery phenols all dance about on the nose, with the wood both softening and deepening as it warms. I smelled this thing for about 5 minutes before even trying a sip. No alcohol, no flaws.Flavor does not disappoint in the least. Soft, dry barrel character and soft, sweet malt character balance each other, while tight, ample carbonation further amplifies the softness/creaminess of the palate. Lightly acidic red wine notes, bits of oakiness and some dry mineral/chalk character build up slowly on the palate, as tart, lemon-lime-like brett notes add brightness and a bit of sharp acidity, as well. Lactic acids soften things, adding a pinch of mild yogurt/cheese-like character and it ends with soft malt and wood character trailing off, with pleasant, not-overdone acidity lingering lightly, as well.Whew. What a beer! Over the course of this amazing weekend, trying all kinds of delicious, highly rated beers, I think this one would only be matched by Ann itself. And to think this beer had only 4 months in the bottle at this point. All signs point to this beer with 1-2 years of age on it being absolutely divine; the light touches of sharp acidity from the yeast/bacteria should soften, as well as allowing for the wine/barrel character to integrate just a little more. As it is, though, Id be happy to drink this fresh any day of the week. Rating is for this bottle I had, but also the potential I think this beer has for being even better aged.  Could very easily trying an older bottle and giving it a 5.  Hope that happens!Huge thanks to Adam C for opening this!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2878,"2014-03-21",4.3,"The beer pours out a dark copper-amber color with a tiny scrim of caramel-white bubbles that mellow into a nice ring around the glass. In body, the beer is nearly a uniform color throughout with a rich opacity. On the nose, this beer reeks of beautiful funk; lemon-lime and horse blanket tango on the nostrils alongside nuances of pineapple, leather, cherry pie, and deep barnyard scents. What a beautiful nose on this beer. On the tongue, the beer tastes of a wonderfully balanced tartness alongside a smooth malt sweetness and just a kiss of herbal and spicy hop bitters at the back and finish. As the beer warms, a smooth and syrupy sweetness also starts to blanket the tongue throughout the sip, further pressing a nice balance throughout the beer. In flavor, the beer begins as pineapple juice and light caramel, slowly working its way to sweet barnyard and horse blanket. The finish blends horse blanket, caramel malt, pineapple juice, herbal hay, and grass notes onto the tongue. Soft touches of pine and this delicious yet unplaceable sweetness splash over the back of the palate. The aftertaste is a delicious blend of caramel and funk, almost like a softly candied funk. In the mouth, the beer is on the light side of medium, with a soft carbonation and a mouthfeel that is smooth and slightly syrupy. Overall, this is delicious and a perfect candidate for aging. The funk will only get better. Sometimes I want to dislike Hill Farmsteads beer, but I never can. This beer is great.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

A - Pours a cloudy dark red body. Messy off-white foam.

S - My first thought was of a Flemmish bruin. Has a lactic twang with some cherries, vinegar, apricot and plenty of oak. Some musky saison notes with a touch of caramel. 

T - Tart cherries and vinegar, caramel malts, funky earthy notes, fresh apricot, and some light oak and vanilla. Really complex and tasty. The finish was unreal though. The beer was incredibly tart and then it just vanishes away. Medium bodied with nice carb.

O - The first half of the glass left me a bit underwhelmed. The more I thought about the beer the more I liked it though. Its incredibly complex and unique. Super tart with a perfectly clean finish. It drinks way too easily. Certainly worth the effort to get a bottle in person.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

2878,"2013-02-27",4.4,"750 mL 2011 bottle.  Thanks Tucker.  Shared shortly after the Ann release.

Pours a generally clear ruby brown with a large off white head.  Long retention and sticky, thick lacing.  Nose is a complex blend of sweet bread, malt, woodsy and earthy oak, vanilla, and yeasty spice.  Flavor is more of the same as the nose, funky and earthy, spicy yeast and oak, mild vanilla and malt sweetness.  Medium thick body, prickly carbonation, mild tartness in the finish. Just wow, as nice as Ann was, this was the standout for me.  Edit: Early sample of the 2012 batch was equally special, with a little more barrel (port like) and fruit presence than I remembered from the 2011 bottle.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","yourefragile"

Body is light, assertive carbonation, and a touch of dryness to it.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"

Feel is soft washing carbonation, pleasant.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
2878,"2012-10-12",4.3,"In short: An intense, sharp, tart, citric, oaky, wild amber amber.  Unique creation.
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed approximately 4 months after the beer release (first batch, only batch so far).  Split two-way
The look: Cloudy amber-orange body topped by a small beige head
In long: Nose is bright brett, plenty of freshly cut oak, some citric fruits, a countryside sensation.  Taste is uber-rustic, tart red and light color fruits, plenty of oak tannins, woody white wine, something that resembles raspberry seeds, strong farmhouse character, lemony citric notes, fresh oranges.  The oak is coming out strong in this beer.  Crispy mouthfeel with an aggressive carbonation.   This tasted like a blend of 50% wild oaky Sour ale and 50% uber-rustic blond Saison.  As far as style is concerned I thought this was closer to what ratebeer usually classifies as a Wild/Sour then the current style Bière De Garde.  An excellent beer but very razor-sharp and not as highly drinkable as all other Hill Farmstead wild ales, this is almost a sipper.  I should add that my brother thought it was the best Hill Farmstead he ever had, but he doesnt rate and I do, I think Biere De Norma is just on par with the average standard of excellent Hill Farmstead quality, a great beer.  Impossible to find, but with I drink a beer I dont care about superficial things like how rare or how hyped the beer is, I only care about meaningful important things, like how jealous tickers will be that I drank this beer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2878,"2012-08-25",3.8,"Bottle generously provided by Gonzoillini. Thank you Tony, Ive been interested in trying this for a very long time.  Pours a cloudy brownish orange in color with very little head on the pour. I wanted to note that the bottle foamed out of the neck after opening, so keep an eye when opening. Nose is interesting and I dont know if I exactly like it. There is honey, white wine, hops, and some band aid characteristics. Not bad, but its peculiar. Taste is better, its more focused on the white wine and lemon characters. There is some grassiness to it, it is faintly hoppy and somewhat saison-like. Mouthfeel is light, carbonation is light to non-existent, gentle acidity, and a short to moderate finish. Its one of the better Biere de gardes Ive had, but probably not the best. Still really thankful to try it, thanks again Tony!","Illinois, USA","Dunt"

2878,"2012-08-07",4.0,"My Bottom Line :  
White wine, citric tartness and lean cereals meld in this salutary rural quencher.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam covers the hazy pale amber.
-Cereal contribution is long and engaging. 
-Citric tartness is higher than the usual Hill Farmstead Saisons.
-Even though this was excellent, I would say full flavor cohesion had not been reached yet. Had I had another bottle, I would have kept a few more months at least.
-The big, prickly bubbles could have been a tad softer, if I have to nitpick.

The nose carries some typical biere de garde character, with some semi-sweet malt and a touch of bread, followed up with a nice oak component.  Also there is a bit of cherry alongside some faint acidity.  The acid component grows through the flavor, leading the way to an exquisite mouthfeel -- dry, tart, and a nice bit of oak.

Even after just having Ann, this was a beautiful beer and one of the better ones Ive had in a long time.  A great take on the biere de garde style, without being in name only.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"

The beer is hazy and dark orange with a half inch of off white head.

Extremely quenching with mild sweet roll and sweet funky cheese rind. Mouth watering brine. Way easier to drink than Mimosa. Could chug a pitcher of this so fast which makes me think saison is still the style or perhaps sour/wild since the lactic sourness is much more pronounced than the subtle, doughy character of their saison anthology.
