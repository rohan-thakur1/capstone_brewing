Aroma of orange, grapefruit, some mango, slight pine, toasted malts, a little caramel and subtle grassy hops. Taste of orange, grapefruit, mango, some peach, slight pine, toasted malts, a little caramel and subtle spicy, grassy hops. Medium bodied and an oily texture. A dryish, toasted malt, citrus hop bitterness in the finish. I think a bog standard American pale ale overall but very fruity, a good malt backbone and hint of pine throughout. Little sweet at times but decent.","Stoke On Trent, Staffordshire, ENGLAND","Towey1989"

1889,"2015-08-31",3.9,"Clear brilliant deep golden with a thin sticky white cap. Lovely leafy and grassy noble hop aroma with some slight earthiness and a touch of toasty and grassy/leafy sweetness. Smooth and crisp English flavor with clean pale malt and a sweet undertone with a mild grassy and leafy resiny fresh hop flavor.
