Fairly complex, intense roasted malt aroma of rye, burned sugar and oak barrell, with a hint of dark fruit, brandy and vanilla (the last two probably components of the oak barrell aroma). The aroma mellows down a bit after half a pint.

Wrong!  I only came across it on my last day in London.  I think it was at the Hung Drawn And Quatered, one of the most beautiful London pub (not on ratebeer because its a Fullers pub with a limited beer selection).  Brown-black body with a small tan head.  Body was thinner but the taste was less molasses/sticky than the bottle. Rich roasted malt flavour with slightly bitter dark chocolate and some black liquorice.  Very well balanced.  In a way lighter than the bottle but better and easier to drink.

There is a huge chandelier hanging from a glass domed ceiling and up the back there is a minstrel gallery. Could you look down at all the smiling faces as Jethro Tull suggested? Too right, they would be beaming with these great Fullers beers on tap. This sits in the glass with the promise that you are going to drink something special. Lovely chocolate colour with an equal nose of chocolate mocha and black malt. There is a perfect balance in the flavour between the malt and hops and there is a presence of sticky date pudding, complete with a butterscotch sauce. I didnt team this with the game pie of venison, rabbit, boar, bacon and mushrooms but I reckon this would be a match made in heaven. .","Potts Point, New South Wales, AUSTRALIA","Sully"

183,"2004-12-04",4.1,"Ive not always been the biggest fan of Fullers beers and Im really a cask enthusiast at heart, so Id never gone out of my way to try Fullers London Porter from a pasteurised bottle. So, when Fullers  released a cask version, for a sadly limited period, I was very keen to try it. And I was not disappointed. Its rich and dark, and fruity, and chocolaty, and roast malty.  Full bodied, but smooth. Even more impressive, it worked very well as a session beer. At least, I had four pints of it and they slipped down very easily indeed. It just goes to show that Fullers can make a hugely impressive beer when they put their mind to it. Just a shame that they release it on cask so infrequently. Wonderful stuff.
