At first the lager tones escaped me, the crisp clean hop tones stole the show, but at the same time they are smoother, more rounded than youd expect from the style, no real big noble hop bite.

826,"2013-12-21",2.9,"Got this as an extra from a DLD trade. Here we go:

A: pours a light golden lager with a single finger of white suddy foam which falls to a veritable sheet of the same with ascending collared grace. Excellent to brilliant clarity.

S: Smells of classic grainy pilsner. Catch includes a bit of metallic scents in there. Wishing for a bit more crispy final hop notes. 

T: Tastes like a pilsner with corn added. Not impressed. The grain bill is evident, and simple. 

M: Medium feel with moderate carb. Slightly dry on the finish.

O: This is an unimpressive beer for FFF. Imperial Pilsners can be so much more: hops and malts can take on beautiful and compex nuances. Too bad they were unable to make this happen.

826,"2013-08-05",4.0,"Appearance:medium light yellow with a dense but fluffy white head that left significant swathes of soapy lace.  Aroma: 	big dose of floral and grassy hops over a barely detectable bed of crackery pilsner malt.  Taste: bright citrus tang and big floral hops up front, then a good hit of slightly sweet toasted white bread. Finish: crisp but not clean (in a good way), as the lingering hops dry the palate nicely. Notes: This was, simply, great. The palate was spot on perfect, and the hoppy character was borderline insubordinate. Also, the cover art looked like a cross between Heironymous Bosch and Warhammer 40,000.","Maryland, USA","JDBaker11058"

I am not getting much in the way of nose, probably a consequence of letting it age for a year. well, then again, there is a welcome whiff of alcohol after a few more sniffs. Sipping it does give the nice impression of a high-powered malt liquor, without the headache inducing fusels (Heloooo Big Hurt). A true gargleblaster to give my sore throat a wakeup call, with not just alcohol but fizz.

826,"2011-05-29",3.1,"This does not resemble a Pilsner in anything but color. I sometimes wonder if some American brewers have even tried a damn Pilsner. Sure, this is supposedly, a strong version thereof so they can reasonably have some differences but this is quite simply nothing at all like a Pilsner. So why call it that? Hell, I guess its a beer word people have heard, maybe it just saves time to call things something they arent... Its not a bad beer though. Its pale golden beer w/ a nice white head. Nose is quite fruity w/ a slightly sulfur-like bread yeast character. Honestly, Id be as likely to guess its a Belgian yeast as a lager by which I mean to say this is squarely in American ale territory as far as the yeast character. Its surprisingly fruity for  its claimed style and really much closer to an IPA w/ its soapy bitterness and citrus elements. The texture though is a high point, very smooth w/ crisp carbonation. This a decent brew just nothing close to resembling its claimed style.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

826,"2011-05-08",2.5,"Picked this bottle up at Dark Lord Day. After excitement, it fails to live up to expectations. Served in a Russian River pilsner glass.

Pour yields a mostly-clear golden-colored brew with a thin (for the style) white head and not much lacing. Some spots as it goes down, after a few swirls. The nose carries a bit of light grain and a very slight touch of floral hops. A bit bready. The flavor is all too bready without a real ho component to back it up. It seems like its a bit stale, which I would expect to be the case had I not just picked it up at the brewery. Body is far too thick with a strong bready component. Hops are tertiary; Im not sure whats secondary. Adequate carbonation but I cant get past the excessive body and lack of bitterness or anything resembling crispness. Not a fan, not a fan at all.

At any rate, super happy this was brewed with the intense metal band Lair of the Minotaur!   Appearance a very bright, vibrant orange with a thin white head.  Aroma not really too much, lager yeast and some soft malts.  Taste is pretty good, has that nice pilsner malt/crispness but definitely packs a punch.  Also a sweetness in the backing.  Imperial pilsners arent typically on my radar but its not bad.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"
