>>> An easy drinking De Garde with a burst of fresh raspberries in the nose and a bearable lactic and cheesy presence.

-  Hazy-cloudy pinkish red with a medium quickly vanishing pink head. 
-  Nose is bursting with fresh raspberries with some leafy notes coming along. 
-  Aroma is a bit cheesy and lactic, but its somewhat hidden by the intense fruitiness. It gets way more noticeable in taste where its the main feature though. Not as cheesy as many other De Garde Bus which make it one of the good Bus that I have tried so far. 
-  Body is light to medium. Carbonation is light. Cheesy finish. 
-  Unlike many other De Garde (even low abv Berliner Weisse), this is easy drinking and not too puckering. Tasty stuff. 

Flavors:  Fresh raspberries, cheesy/lactic presence (especially in taste), leafy/herbal notes, mild oak spiciness.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

3916,"2015-01-31",3.9,"Bottle at home with my wife. Pour is bright magenta with a big white head and decent lacing. Tangy, red berries, big herbal notes, medicinal, spruce tips, some spice and heavy oak in the aroma. Taste is tannic, spicy, highly medicinal, raspberry skins, oaky, salty, lactic and light vanilla with a huge sour finish. Medium body with high carbonation. Tons of fruit and herbal characteristics, but could definitely use a cut to the acidity.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
3916,"2015-01-25",4.1,"I drink a lot of the De Garde beers, but never log my thoughts - for shame.

Pours a nice rosy red with only a central etch. Brilliant clarity. Smells of raspberry, soil and a touch of black olive juice. Flavor is all raspy with some notches of oak tannins. Theres a bit of a watered character to this compared to some of the other variants - a little lower carb as well. This actually plays well on the beer and gives it a bit of a effervescent cran-raz juice character. Dry finish. Nice beer.","Spokane, Washington, USA","harrymel"
3916,"2014-12-06",4.2,"Bottle... This beer rocks! Pours hazy and red with orange highlights and no head. The aroma is a mélange of raspberries, oak and funk. Full-bodied with a skim-milk mouthfeel and pillow-soft carbonation. This stuff is stupid sour and big-time fruity with heaps of raspberries. Finishes tart and somewhat dry.

3916,"2014-09-28",3.4,"[ Bottle ][ ½ of 75cl ][ Tasting ][ Trade ][ Snifter ][ 9.24.14 ] Translucent ruby, puffy white head fizzes away quick. High citric acid nose, lightly green vegetal notes, seedy raspberry has arsenic notes (more with warmth) and papery bitterness, absolutely no sweetness. Ultra slick body, tepid with almost no carbonation, very light seed and arsenic, tons of citric acid mid, burning grapefruit and tangerine, rindy sourness, ultra sticky acids coat the puckered mouth. Finish is very watery, acids are everything, no grain balance, no bitterness. Really singular experience, tons of citric acid with moderate raspberry character, no balance, bitter skin quality reminds more of cherry than an arsenic seedy raspberry, light sweetness adds balance in the finish.[ 9.24 Tasting Ranking ]01.
