3421,"2017-04-25",4.4,"Neck label says 2016, so here goes the contents of this 12floz beer, Its brown in color and smells like sweettarts brand candy. Hmmm...doesnt taste like sweettarts, maybe beer flavor sweettarts. Sourness is rather soft and sweetness comes through for much more than other brown sours Ive tried. Palate is medium carbonation and body, and toes the line between sweet and sou (raspberry, cherry, and lactic acid all over) oh so well. New Glarus just does beer right is all I really need to say.","","balloonbuffoon"
3421,"2017-02-03",4.2,"Got in a trade with The-Adjunct-Hippie. 12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 1/22/2016. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red/light copper/brown color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass. Aromas of big tart cherry, cranberry, raisin, plum, currant, lemon, green apple, red grape, caramel, brown sugar, toasted oak, brown bread, hay, and straw; with lighter notes of vanilla, leathery funk, red wine vinegar, pepper, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, oak barrel, and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big tart cherry, cranberry, raisin, plum, currant, lemon, green apple, red grape, caramel, brown sugar, toasted oak, brown bread, hay, and straw; with lighter notes of vanilla, leathery funk, red wine vinegar, pepper, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate fruity/lactic tartness and light yeast/tannic oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart cherry, cranberry, raisin, plum, currant, lemon, green apple, red grape, caramel, brown sugar, toasted oak, brown bread, light vanilla/nuttiness, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, oak barrel, and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/tartness balance, with zero puckering/astringent flavors after the finish. Light dryness from tartness/acidity, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy/acidic, and lightly tannic balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.6%. Overall this is a fantastic Flanders brown ale! All around outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, oak barrel, and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and refreshing to drink, thanks to the mellow tartness/acidity. Amazing yeast/malt complexity and balance; with nice oak presence. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

3421,"2016-11-12",4.4,"Im convinced that New Glarus didnt actually brew this. I think its more plausible that the brewers traveled back in time and stole this beer straight from old-world Flanders. Its color is red/brown. Funky, horsey, woodsy, and fruity nose.

Pours a semi-clear dark copper brown colored brew with an average size off-white head that slowly dissipates and leaves behind some excellent lacing.

Finish continues the tart flanders style brown tart ale with profiles of lingering cherries and light citrus. Both sweet and tart cherries throughout the flavor and finish really makes this one outstanding sour brown.

3421,"2016-08-24",3.8,"12 ounce bottle from Badger Spirits in Janesville, WI (July 2016), served at cellar temp from a New Glarus glass. A quick-diminished largish tan head tops a copper-rust translucent body, leaving delicate traces of lacing as it recedes....nose is pretty strongly oaky, with hints of vanilla, caramel and tart cherry, pleasant and balanced but not as powerful as Id hoped...in the mouth, its got such a light - in the best way - soft mouthfeel, that this velvety touch initially overwhelms the tartness in my imagination...theres a plumminess and richness in there in the center, but mostly its sour cherries and oak and a touch of licorice...carbonation is very strong but for my taste not overdone - though it might be for some. Overall another winner from this brewery, though certainly not among their best.

3421,"2016-07-31",2.9,"12 oz. bottle, consumed on 7-28-16. Pours a medium to dark brown with a small to moderate amount of short-lasting, beige head. Nice color, but short-lasting head is a disappointment. Cola-like appearance. Lemony, sneezy smell features scents of vinegar, apples, crabapples, and apple cider. Reasonably strong smell, but that sneezy quality just isnt very appetizing. Subtle flavor is at least as much brown ale as it is sour. Milk chocolate flavor. Gets increasingly unsour and bland upon multiple sips. Mineral, metallic finish. Reminds me a bit of a soured English porter. Does not work particularly well. Lively and fizzy in the palate. Medium body. Nowhere close to as good as last years version, and yet its receiving better ratings here; bizarre. Annoyingly mediocre.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Despite being in a little bit of a rush I managed to swing by Hopcat for a pint of this excellent Flemish sour. As expected it is very similar to the previous Oud Bruin yet better in some ways. It looks like I am due to make a road trip through Wisconsin some time soon for a couple of four packs.

Aroma / Appearance - A ruby red base shimmers under a vanilla head. Tart cherries, musty books, and vinegar define an acidic but sweet profile. Crisp sharp bitterness cuts through everything else.

Flavor / Palate - An easy drinking body makes it a dangerously accessible sour. Tart sour cherries blossom into a delayed bitterness. The sharpness never gets too harsh. As a result this exceeds the previous batch although Ill have to crack open one for reference.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Mouthfeel: Medium body with high carbonation.

Overall: A fresh, sharp, highly acidic version of the style. Flavor is very complex with high fruitiness upfront, with a subtle oak and vanilla character on the backend. Interested to see how the flavors develop in the cellar.","","TH28"
