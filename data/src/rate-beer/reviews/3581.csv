3581,"2015-12-01",3.9,"Bottle: Poured a bright yellow color ale with a large off-white foamy head with good retention and some good lacing. Aroma of coriander with light tart notes is pretty enticing. Taste is a nice mix of coriander with light tart notes with hints of truffle notes and alight saline finish. Body is pretty full for style with great carbonation. Very drinkable example of the style with good amount of complexity.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
3581,"2015-10-31",3.7,"The beer is a medium-light golden yellow color. Its somewhat hazy. Large white head, a little fizzy and fades to not much. Fairly mild aroma. Its most a citric yogurty flavor with a big, soft wheaty sweetness. Some peach. Moderately phenolic. Mild coriander. The truffle adds a nice earthy element but its pretty light. Not too exciting. A little more flavor in the taste. Mild tartness. Some citrus bitterness. Some saltiness, mostly in the aftertaste. That sweet wheat flavor makes it all very pleasant and drinkable. Good lacto flavor. Its just a bit unexciting compared to some of the new gose that have come out recently. Light but full mouthfeel. Quite soft. Mild pucker.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3581,"2015-06-24",2.7,"Bottle. Pours crystal clear golden with a small white head and some lacing. Aroma is light wheat, earthy , coriander, mushrooms. Flavor is light sweet, light bitter, not really goseey, but mushrooms evident. Light body, high carbonation. I am not a fan of the base gose from Upright, and it turns out that adding funguses doesnt help any. Who would have thought.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

3581,"2015-02-14",4.5,"Received from 2014 Secret Santa -- This was a delight to drink. Very refreshing with salt that gets your attention. Drank side-by-side with the regular Gose, and really couldnt detect a huge difference from this version to that version. This one was a little smoother and rounded, but still great. I would love to drink this again, and again, and again, and you get the point.","North Dakota, USA","GreatDane1632"

3581,"2014-08-05",3.8,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is interesting with a nice wheat character followed by some coriander and a moderately strong truffle aroma. Light stone fruit and citrus character. 
Pours a hazy, pale golden orange with a big, fluffy white head that recedes fairly quickly to a thin layer on the edges. No lacing and faint legs. 
Flavor has a light sweetness and medium light acidity. Light stone fruit and medium light citrus character. Low coriander and phenolic notes. I dont really pick up more than a hint of the truffles and some light earthiness; this character was more prevalent in the aroma. Low and only slightly noticeable saltiness. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, an alright gose but Im not sure the truffles add anything more than an interesting note to the aroma and a background flavor. Salinity and acidity are about what I was expecting, though it could be a bit more acidic. Nice yeast character.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
