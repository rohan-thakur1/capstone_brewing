1645,"2016-05-21",3.9,"Taps opaque coffee sable with a nice light tan head. Aroma presents smoky roast malt, quality coffee and licorice tones. Flavor delivers all at the aroma promises and adds a hint of oyster. Yes, oyster indeed. Mouthfeel features body that seems thin for a stout, and some decent fizz. Get moony and stoned.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
1645,"2015-12-22",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 25, 2015 Really drinkable. Love the flavor with 4.5%. Dry, but not boring. Oyster notes are subtle. Roasted malts and chocolate dominate. Not overly complex but rated so highly for pure drinkability. Sea salt comes through- could say briny. Really smooth. I would expect their flagship to be great, and it is. 
12/23  Had this on cask with Hibiscus.  Excellent.  Wish their glassware were cleaner.   Really pretty pink hue to the tan head.   Floral notes there, but subtle. All the great notes of the flagship with added smoothness and interest.  Points for originality.  Love this place!","","woodychevy"

1645,"2012-07-18",3.7,"On draught at the Lobster House in Asheville. Pours almost opaque black into the glass, with a one-finger retentive choco-tan head that leaves thick lacing. Woody-smoked chocolate to the nose. Creamy mouthfeel, with roasted coffee and chocolate to the tongue. The finish is silky, of coffee. The sea salt comes through nicely with other trace minerals. Crisp and dry but extremely creamy and fluffy on the palate. Nice job.

1645,"2011-06-19",3.6,"Beer pours black with thick tan lacing. There is a mild aroma of stone and earth. The beer does have a hint of saltiness on the palate.

1645,"2010-10-14",4.0,"Appearance: Deliver to the table a sturdy-looking, black body with at least a full inch of khaki-colored foam.

Smell: Aroma of roasted barley with sweetish notes smelling of chocolate, primarily, but also coffee, vanilla, and a snippet of licorice. Distant whiff of pungent, briny seaside breezes.

Taste: Dusky, dusty roasted malt tones with light tastes of chocolate powder and coffee. Restrained sweetness. While plenty roasty, there are no sharp, acrid burnt grain flavors. Hint of pruneskin fruitiness. Buried within is a minute chalky mineral character and pinch of quality sea salt. Lightly roasty, earthy bitterness. Soft finish trailing out with a flavor of semi-sweet chocolate.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-low carbonation. Slight smooth creaminess to the mouthfeel.

Drinkability: A relatively light, smooth stout thats certainly fine on its own, but a bit better when paired with their raw oyster sampler.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
1645,"2010-09-19",3.8,"Served from the tap with a deep, dark color and a creamy tan head. The aroma features a dry sweetness and something of a crisp mineral scent. The flavor is a mild, dry sweetness contrasted with the chocolate and coffee from the roasted malt. In addition, the same earthy mineral character from the aroma is likewise in the flavor, presumably from the use of oyster shells in the beer. Smooth and easy-drinking overall.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","devilben02"

The roast is more acidic than anything else.  Seems to go quite well with my oysters, but I would not drink alone.  Very minimal aroma.  Dont really have anything to say about that one way or another other than that it is non existent.  Relatively think body with an acidic finish that makes this stout seem dry.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

1645,"2009-06-22",3.7,"on tap @ Lobster Trap. Pours a ruby/black with nitrogen induced cascades and tight head. The aroma is salty, chocolatey, dry, and woody. Lots of fish flavor is present, especially in the finish. In the mouth, this begins a little sour with dry chocolate and salt, but fades to a delightfully smoky/fishy/dry stout kind of thing.
