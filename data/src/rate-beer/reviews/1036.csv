1036,"2017-06-14",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2017 250 ml bottle, bottled Dec. 2015, from a trade with GTH, many thanks for this gem!
Black body, with a small, dense, coffee-colored head. 
Aroma of dried fruits, cocoa, toffee, berries, coffee, honey, some wood, some liquorice. 
Tastes similar, with the berries coming through a bit more and some booze. 
Medium, creamy mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation. 
Finishes smooth, medium sweet, medium roasty, a bit dry, a bit alcoholic, with cocoa, wood, some coffee, some liquorice, some berries. 

Tasty. Very smooth, with the typical notes of the style, which are very well balanced, supported by the subtly integrated berries, coming more through in the taste and especially as the beer warms up. Overall this reminds me more of an Imperial Porter (well the name says it...) and its not among my favourite beers, but still a lovely, smooth sipper, with a lot of subtle quality and a glad opportunity to try this.

Bottled 12/2015. black color, small coffee colored head. smells earthy, licorice, bit joghurty, some flowery notes, berries. nice smell overall. full body, light carbonation, slick mouthfeel. tastes earthy, peppery, berry notes, lightly boozy, bit cardboardish, light juniper, hints of joghurt. finishes dryish with notes of earth, berry notes and light cardboard. hmm, not bad but expected a bit more. Maybe a tad overrated, not a big fan on the balance. a bit harsh even. More like a traditional ale than an imp stout. Overall still rather good though.","Vienna, AUSTRIA","Werckmeister"

I thought cherry at first, as the raspberry has almost no acidity. Tastes much more of raspberry. Sharp and a little tart. Bourbon has a much more distinct flavor. Dominates the flavor. Chocolate, licorice, very rich and boozy. Heavy and quite sweet. Really good, but I think the rarity and hype is building this thing up.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

1036,"2015-06-04",4.5,"The only thing I can think of that isnt close to perfect with this masterpiece, is that it was served at approximately -272 ºC. Its very strange that a dead serious company like Närke can make a mistake like that. Apart from this: pure perfection! It pours a black, viscous body with a creamy, medium brown to maroon, very long-lived head that laces my glass excellently. The aroma is strong and malty with amazing roasted notes of chocolate overdose, dark caramel, vanilla and a faint fruity background. Far in the back there are vague hints of berries. The flavour is very strong, extraordinarily complex and utterly delicious. Again lots and lots of dark chocolate, but equally strong are the raspberries. This is like drinking raspberry chocolate! There are also other roasted malty notes with coffee, and vanilla in the back. The initial taste is moderate sweet, but very soon a refreshing acidity from the raspberries kicks in, followed by an everlasting moderate bitterness. This is a perfectly balanced beer: on once side there is the sweet taste and the chocolate flavour, on the other there is acidity, bitterness and crisp raspberries. Amazing! The mouthfeel is very pleasant, its full-bodied, oily and with a soft carbonation. One of the very best beers Ive ever tried. I deeply regret that I only had a tiny 1 dl sample, I should have drunk this divine brew all evening.

Answering to this years festivals Radler challenge by taking one of the worlds most sought after beers and blending it out with fruit juice, without announcing the base of the beer before the festival is a cool idea anyway you look at it. It would be unfair of me to compare this one to the original Kaggen, both because its pretty close to 4 years since I had it, but also since this is an occasion-themed variation. Still, I think its safe to say that this version wont challenge the originals status. The beer itself is all black, with a dark brown head. Yeah, you know, the Kaggen look. Aroma starts roasty with dark fruits, licorice, mild berry notes, not totally overtaking the beer luckily, with subtle oak notes. Taste is more or less as expected, a solid thick Roasty chocolate body, pleasant mild vanilla and wood, with a fruity touch I like to believe is the berries.

smaken zijn chocolade, vanille, whiskey/bourbon, gebrande- en geroosterde mouten, koffie, een heerlijke goede volle smaak. 
volle body, romig, glad, alcoholisch, fruitigheid van de framboos komt iets té licht binnen maar al met al een héérlijk bier !","Leeuwarden, NETHERLANDS","ShivanDragon"

1036,"2014-09-28",4.6,"huray huray... reached my 1000th review during BBF festival. and this was just the perfect beer during borefts to celebrate this achievement. what a suprise they had this one. it was by far the best beer (for me) during the day. small sample from draft. poured a deep dark black colour with a nice mocha coloured head. there is definitely red fruits (raspberries) in the aroma. but not overwelming. strong chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, oak, licorice, vanilla, oak, bourbon. the raspberry really kicks in with the first sip! its like eating a fresh raspberry with a big thick stout! really complex and balanced with the stout and the fruit part. barrel notice is not overwelming but its there. incredible!","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"
1036,"2014-09-28",4.6,"Tap at Borefts 2014. Pours near black with a beige head. Aroma of red fruits, raspberry, roast, dark chocolate, caramel and fudge. Flavour is heavy sweet and moderate bitter. Thick and oily mouthfeel. Full bodied with soft carbonation. An excellent re-introduction of a Kaggen varient!","The Hague / Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","kermis"
