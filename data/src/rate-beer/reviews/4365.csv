4365,"2008-10-23",3.7,"Bottle. Pours opaque black-brown with fizzy tan head. Lovely chocolate aroma. Lots of cocoa, carob, rain on asphalt. Clean smell. Soft creamy mouthfeel. Sweet, creamy, almost lucious, solid body. A tad too sweet but very chocolately. Like a creamy chocolate cake.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
4365,"2008-10-16",3.6,"Pours dark brown and flat. The aroma is a smoky-molasses with lots of wood, maybe rye bread.  Soft, sweet and smooth, with mellow molasses and a light hint of woodiness.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
4365,"2008-08-14",3.5,"Courtesy dchmela.  Black with a thin off-white layer of foam.  Licorice and roast on the nose, a bit roasty for a schwarzbier.  Cleaner taste, nice palate - very light roast and a smooth finish, not too sweet.","Florida, USA","JMFG"

4365,"2008-08-03",4.3,"2008-08-02. Pitch black with a modest dark head. Sweet dark malt aroma, cocoa and a light roast. Flavour is similar, smooth chocolately malt, kissed by toasty roasty malt, just a touch of bitterness. Just  a great, rich overall flavour. Smooth medium bodied palate. Pretty awesome, I can’t believe it took me so long to get to it. Many thanks Bobby. Bottle courtesy of OKBeer.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
4365,"2008-07-22",3.8,"Bottle Pours pitch black with a small, creamy, khaki head. Decent retention. The aroma provides a light puff of campfire smoke alongside charcoal and tobacco malts. Full-bodied with a velvety mouthfeel and pillow-soft carbonation. Sweet, vinous and chocolaty with a touch of molasses or licorice or both. Dark fruits. Lightly charred, warming finish. Kudos to dchmela for providing the bottle!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
4365,"2008-07-17",3.4,"Bottle sampled at mgumby10’s, thanks dchmela:  I don’t know if this is quite nirvana as it is chocolate-covered banana.  Flavor is a roasted chocolate malt, some raisin, warm finish.  I thought there’d be more going on here, although not a complex beer, still tasty.","I F&ckin hate those guys from, Ohio, USA","Rogueone"
4365,"2008-07-14",3.6,"Courtesy dchmela.  Pours a dark brown, with a small off white head.  Smells of roasty dark malt, and tons ofdark fruits found in most schwarzbiers.  Really dug that nose.  The flavor is seemingly more on the roasty side, with touches of dark fruit, and hints of mild chocolate.  Maybe not quite as good as the nose, but more than competent.  This was a pleasant surprise.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
4365,"2008-07-14",4.0,"Bottle courtesy of OKBeer -- thanks man, I owe you a beer! Pours a deep dark brown, almost black, with a large lasting creamy  tan head -- nice!

Nose of bigtime coffee, roastiness, and chocolate; clear very dark brown with a small tan head; flavor is coffee, rich creamy chocolate, and a very light background bitterness.

jet black pour, nice big foamy beige head. Aroma is quite roasty, and full of chocolate, and coffee. Wow, if i didnt know this was a lager, i would bet the farm on it being a stout. Excellent lager, easily the most flavourful lager i have ever tried, very roasty, and full of stout like flavours, nice stuff!","Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, CANADA","robinvboyer"
4365,"2008-05-03",4.0,"Bottle. Nearly black dark brown color with small, tan-colored head and some thick lacing. Aromas of mild hops, tangy molasses and toast. Feels very nice on the tongue leaving a nice smoky aftertaste. Slightly warming due to the extra alcohol. Very nice.","Penobsquis, New Brunswick, CANADA","albert007"
4365,"2008-04-14",4.0,"Bottle (500ml).  Shared with garthicus, bottle courtesy of tupalev.  Black-ruby pour, solid tan head.

Fairly thick and silky mouthfeel, lightly astringent, long deep roast bitter-smooth finish.  Solid, excellent schwarz.  Thanks, Jeff!","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
4365,"2008-04-14",4.0,"Shared with HogTownHarry - Harrys bottle, thanks!: Jet black/brown - tiny caramel coloured head. Tan leather, shoe polish aroma, spicy too, some dark fruit. Flavour: Smooth as silk, spicy, milky too, such flavour, zero alcohol burn, so well hidden. Just a super little beer and only my second Schwarbier. Mmmmm","Dublin, IRELAND","garthicus"
4365,"2008-04-08",4.3,"Very unique beer, dark brown with a small head. Carbonation is low, creamy mouthfeel, really smooth. Smoke, chocolate, licorice, warming alcohol and a little coffee. Phenomenal beer all around, thumbs up on this one.","CANADA","HopDevil"
4365,"2008-04-07",3.7,"Poured a dark brown color with a beige head.  The aroma was of roasted malt, chocolate and mild smoke.  The aroma blended well.  The flavor was of roasted malt and less complex.  Semi-dry finish with a mild bitterness.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
4365,"2008-03-30",4.2,"Bottle, thanks to my friends Big Red and K.  Pitch black, small foamy brown head -if that is a schwarzbier, Ive never seen one that thick before - look substantial.  Chocolaty sweet aroma -some molasses, hint of brown sugar and alcohol.  Taste: Wow.  Light tingly body (not expected upon viewing) yet silky smooth taste features tons of chocolate and lots of dark malt sweetness.  Lots of hops come through, lots of alcohol, especially in finish.  Porter+dunkel+Schwarzbier = this?  Great combo, wonderfully balanced (somehow), complex. A stunning hybrid, Garrison is going to really really miss Greg Nash, beers like this are not easily duplicated.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
4365,"2008-03-15",3.7,"Shared, thanks to joemcphee.  Dark brown / black pour with some off-white head.  Aroma is toasted / smoked malt, sweet caramel, and cola.  Flavor is toasted / burnt malt, bitter chocolate and light roast.  Pretty good beer.","San Mateo, California, USA","golubj"
4365,"2008-02-23",3.7,"Bottle. Heavy malt aromas of dark bread and toasted, light herbs for the hops, light earth for the yeast, with cola, charcoal, alcohol and dark dried fruit in the background. Head is fizzy/bubbly, light brown, mostly diminishing and has fair lacing. Color is sparkling brown/black. Flavor is moderately sweet and lightly acidic to start, then finishes lightly acidic and moderately bittersweet. Palate is medium to full, watery/creamy and has a fizzy carbonation. It finshes lightly alcoholic. A very enjoyable beer, from the complex aroma to the heartiness of its mouthfeel and taste.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"

4365,"2008-01-13",4.3,"Bottle procured from Troy Burtch (thanks, Troy!). 2007 edition. Very, very dark brown with a good sized creamy beige head. Aroma and flavour both hold dark roasted coffee, charred malt, dark sugar, smoke, dark bittersweet chocolate, and just a hint of booze. Body is full without being sticky, with a nice soft edge.

4365,"2008-01-09",4.3,"500 ml bottle, 2007 edition (just in case theres a 2008). Pitch black in colour with no trace a light coming through whatsoever and a mostly lasting creamy tan head. Smoky, roasty, chocolate, coffee, lightly nutty, and a touch of raisin aroma. Smoked cheese, nutty, chocolate, roasty coffee, a trace of alcohol, orange rind, and vinous flavours with a roasty and smoky bitter finish. Medium bodied, very smooth and drinkable for the abv, almost juicy mouthfeel. Perfect soft carbonation for the nature of this beer  Id say for the style but I cant figure out exactly what that is for sure. Not that I really care, because this is damn good whatever style it is.","Halifax, Nova Scotia, CANADA","OKBeer"
4365,"2007-12-31",4.2,"A very generous gift from geth_in_beer.  Deep black beer with a thick tan head.  Rich chocolatey aroma. Nice toasty, roasty malts with a fairly prominent smokiness throughout.  A soft caramelly malt base backs up these darker roasty characters.  Flavour is fairly sweet and roasty with caramel and dark toasted malts throughout.  A bit of yeastiness behind the clean rich malts.  Fairly insistent smokiness that lingers on the palate.  A lightly salty roastiness, rich and quite decadent.  Sweet but not cloying and there is a nice earthy bitterness on the back that dries it out.  Very tasty and a bit surprise.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
4365,"2007-12-29",3.6,"Stocking stuffer sent from my sister-- thanks! Handsome bottle with a wax seal. Pours a mahogany tinted near black with an almond coloured bubbly head that reduces to a thin ring with scant early lace. Chocolate and burnt malt aroma. Same flavour delivery with a nice medium-heavy mouthfeel, generous malt profile, dry clean finish with low bitterness and medium sweetness. A very solid schwarz, with a higher alcohol content that is well integrated and not intrusive.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
4365,"2007-12-24",4.2,"Pours nearly completely opaque black with hints of deep brown and red.  Thin brown head that dissipates nicely.  Smells a bit smoky with nice undertones of roasted malt.  Flavor has strong roasted malts and smokiness up front with a hint of bitterness.  Long lasting coffee or dark chocolate tasting finish.  Carbonation is low, but its perhaps not quite as thick as a stout, very creamy though.  A very nicely balanced beer.","St. Johns, Newfoundland, CANADA","mullet2007"
4365,"2007-12-09",3.5,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2008 From bottle. I thought I needed to re rate this beer after hearing big things about it. I have to say second time around the beer has a different texture to it and seems to have matured. Aroma and appearance still the same rating, still very Garrison. Flavour seems more complex this time around, hints of chocolate, roasted malts. The thin metallic element is not present this time but a smooth texture. As I take a sip it sends a rush to the head. probably from the alcohol content but not overpowering, just a great way to take in the strong flavours. A fine beer from Garrison. I understand it more but feel its more of a stout to a black lager, but what the heck its still good whatever it is.","Nova Scotia, CANADA","Gethinbeer"
