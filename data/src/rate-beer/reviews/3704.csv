3704,"2008-09-05",4.3,"Draft:  Poured @ MABC, reddish-amber color with a medium-sized white head and incredible amounts of lacing.  Massive caramel malt notes along with an equally sinister amounts of floral and resin-y hops, some mild fruity hints noted as well.  Full-bodied, especially for the style...flavors consist of caramel, light fruits and a wicked-ass hop finish that reminds me of a more balanced version of Uplands Ard Ri.  Exceptional brew.","Ft Wayne, Indiana, USA","bdigital"
