149,"2016-08-09",3.7,"Bottle shared at Ryans August 2016 tasting. Pours a bright golden body, no head/lace. Nose is fresh apple sauce, sugar, maple and apple juice. Mouthfeel is a bit unbalanced, with lots of juice and soft alcohol notes coming through. Not as dense or complex as some other Ice Ciders, but still a nice offering.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
149,"2016-08-07",3.8,"This was a wild looking glass bottle shared by Daddy. Thanks dude. Pours a golden orange shade similar to most ice cider. Notes are straight forward apple, motts juice, and a touch of berry in the close but not as complex as others like Neige or Domaine Pinnacle. Still really nice apple dad juice to sip","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
149,"2016-03-08",4.0,"un cidre ambré avec dabondantes larmes. Au nez, riches pommes cuites et sucre brun, épices et petites baies. Au goût, pommes caramélisées, alcool floral et vanille. En bouche, un corps liquoreux et collant. En finale, une bonne acidité qui fait oublier cette structure solidement douce. Très bon cidre de pommes qui possède une personnalité très intéressante pour moi.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

149,"2016-01-09",3.7,"2 oz sample from bottle (375 ml) at home. 2010 vintage. Clear amber leaving some legs on the glass. Aroma is a bit heavy and boozy reminescent of a calvados with baked apples, mild to moderate spiciness, hints of berries and brown sugar. Taste is moderately sweet and mildly acidic with backed apples, cinnamon, alcohol warmth, brown sugar and mild berries. Medium to full body. Oily and liquorous mouthfeel. Warming finish. Not a top tier ice cider, mainly because it lacks refinement but not bad at all. A tad boozy.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

149,"2015-02-22",4.2,"2015-02-14. Amber body is headless and coats the glass. Aroma is lovely, quite fruity overall, with mild apple and strong notes of lychee or tropical fruit. 9+ Flavour is sweet up front, many of the nuances escape me, touch of baked apple and whispers of caramel but none of those descriptors quite capture what it is like. Dry tannins sneak into the aftertaste. 8+ Smooth bodied palate, no carbonation. Very nice, possibly my favorite that I tried at the festival? Bottle at Mondial des Cidres, Montreal.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
149,"2015-02-19",4.1,"Bottle @ Mondial des Cidres de Glace 2015. Amber pour with nice legs. Rich baked, spiced apples and apple pie on the nose. Some nice vanilla and brown sugar. A hint of alcohol. Sweet apple and caramel flavor. Slightly creamy, some vanilla, and a bunch of spice. Good acidity on the finish which helps to cut some of the rather substantial sweetness.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
149,"2013-09-02",4.0,"Poured a light amber color with aromas of apples, earth, light brown sugar, and baked goods. Flavors follow suit, light spice nice apple flavor, wow, is this solid thanks to the person who shared this little gem.","Florida, USA","burg326"
149,"2012-01-19",4.8,"Bottle (2009) This cider rocks! Clear, light copper ice cider with excellent legwork. The nose is of spiced, baked apples, both fresh and fallen apples, malic acid and an underlying earthy component. Full-bodied with a thick, syrupy mouthfeel  almost chewy. The flavor is flat-out luscious  sweet, tart, fruity, rich, robust and well perfect! Finishes tart-sweet-fruity-nourishing. Drinks like a meal. Awesome, complex stuff! Kudos to MartinT for bringing this down with him from Quebec.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

Mid sweet mid sour taste of apples, notes of spicy berries, aftertaste too alcoholized. An excellent and delicious ice cider!","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","Quevillon"
149,"2010-03-13",4.1,"An almost cognac like coloured cider with a nice complex aroma of cooked apples and light acid point, In mouth, an explosion of flavours, mixed sweet apples, liquorous apple sweetness, good acidity, very nice and complex.
