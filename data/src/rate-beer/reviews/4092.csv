Flavor is sour and acidic with some fruit, wood and Brett. Its surprisingly smooth and rather less acidic and sour than the Geuze, this goes for the complexity as well, pretty straight forward without the depth and richness from a Geuze. At the same time you can detect the basic elements and knowing your Geuze its interesting to sample the basic ingredients. Also a big plus to sample this at the brewery.

A - Pours slightly hazy straw yellow with a small half finger tall bubbly white head, dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving no lace at all down the glass.

S - Smell is pretty muted until it fully warms up. Hints of funky cheese, damp oak, basement must, some lemon zest and a dash of vinegar. 

T - Starts off with a big sour kick that fades as quickly as it hit you leaving behind hints of lemon zest, musty funk, dry oak and a dash of booze burn. Finish is funky with a moderate amount of dryness, doesnt stick around too long tho.

M - Light with very light carbonation. Its has a tart feel but it doest linger for very long, allowing it to be consumed quite easily.

O - I feel like this is exactly what an unblended two year old lambic should taste. Sure its a little rough around the edges, but thats why its perfect for blending and fruit additions.

4092,"2012-10-29",4.0,"New review. The bottle I had before was suspect. This time, I tried the beer on cask at Moeder Lambic Fontainas.

The beer is hazy and copper hued with a thick head. The aroma is funky and fabulous, and of course, embodies that classic Cantillon scent I have come to love. The flavor is fabulous. Earthy, fresh, funky, musty, damp basement, rain, straw, hay, farm. Complex and yet so easy to drink. Light in body but not thin. A wonderful lambic.

***Original review 07 July 2012***

Bottle shared by ygtbsm94. Thanks Brad.

1998 vintage

The beer is transparent and copper to amber in color. No head whatsoever. The aroma brings basement, rain water, funk. The taste is much sweeter than anticipated. A bit of Cantillon funk in the finish, but not to the usual level. Notes of ripe fruit. Overall, this was just ok. I look forward to trying this from the source and comparing to this vintage bottle version.

4092,"2010-09-08",3.7,"My first unblended lambic, straight from the barrel and into my tasting glass at Cantillon - a fantastic treat from a most generous, dedicated and friendly staff! :-D This is a brew now devoid of carbonation, waiting to be infused with a younger, fiery lambic counterpart to produce the famous geuze of Cantillon. A golden, liquid-honey-like body rests elegantly in my glass. Aroma is quite vinous, with sour barnyard hints, dry grapes and yeasty notes lingering around consistently. Taste is sour and tarty at first, then yeasty, then oak comes in before barley malt finally takes over towards the end. Very fascinating build-up on the taste. Palate is completely flat, but still quite drinkable and rather well suited to the characteristics of the taste profile. A strange, interesting, smooth and...flat brew.

Very light woody character, dry in the finish, very light funk. it is much less intense than say the gueuze. The more delicate nuances are quite subtle, with occasional bursts of intensity. 7+ Average to light palate suits it. Sourness is cumulative, and you notice it much more in the second half of the glass.

4092,"2005-06-26",4.1,"Draught @ Monks Cafe in Philladelphia: Brewed in November, 2002.  I was very excited when I spotted this on the tap list for the night.  Lightly hazy, near clear but not quite, light amber-yellow body with no head.  The beer has no carbonation, which is to be expected.  Aroma: Starts off with  mild apples, pears, then opens up to wet hay, aged water-logged wood, barnyard, and a slight funky cheese.  Its possible that it was just the glass, but the aroma did not seem as assertive as other lambics.  Taste: This was milder than most other lambics, particularly one from Cantillon, and packed no in-your-face sourness up front like I was expecting.  Rather, it was almost sweet and had notes of light honey, wood, lightly tart citrus, and a house yeast character that lasts.  Medium dry, no carbonation, with an almost complete lack of acidity.  This beer is so easy to drink that I had to force myself to slow down and enjoy it.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"
4092,"2005-06-01",2.8,"I tasted this at the brewery and it was an interesting experience. The beers aroma is quite good, but nothing special. The taste however is a strange blend of a heavily sour start with medium bitterness in the end. It was like nothing I had ever tasted before, and I have had better lambiks since. Worth a try for sure, but try to comnbine it with a visit at the Brewery in Brussels. And try the Faro as well - it is even more complex.","København, DENMARK","Geuzelambix"

Pleasant dry dusty body, cobwebs, faintly sour, citric, bretty, subtle carbonation, finishing clean with delicate sour notes.   Very drinkable, and quite nice.

Amazing flavor of peaches, probably other fruit in there too, strong acidity and its very dusty.Light body, very dry, dusty and oily texture, almost flat carbonation.

4092,"2005-03-03",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2005 On draught at the Moan and Dove 2/25/05.  Served in its own glass at approx. 50-55 degrees.  2002 vintage.Finally! Ive been looking for this beer for some time now and it was a wonderful sight to see it in front of me at last.  Lightly hazy, soft yellow and light peach-fuzz colored body with no head.  Seems it has lost its luster, if it had any to begin with.  Aroma of light apples, moist hay, light barnyard notes and an easy-going sort of mild cheesiness.  The flavor, at first, seems relaxed and there is no sour punch at the beginning, but the yeastiness grows on the palate towards the finish and the palate grows accustomed to it quite easily.  Light notes of bacteria mixed with some honey and perhaps some tart, tangerine-like flavors.  Halfway through the glass, and I dont even realize it.  Wow, this is an easy-drinking beer!  Hints of carbonation grace the palate, not sharp or prickly, but large, airy bubbles add a light feel to the body.  Slight wateriness at the end.  A very relaxed and agreeable lambic.I think in heaven, this is served as a daily session beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4092,"2004-12-22",4.0,"12 oz draft glass at Hopleaf in Chicago, 1 year old.  Still, very cloudy yellow-gold, no head at all...very sharp barnyard-sour lemon-apple nose, nearly overpowering...sour/tart body with a body that starts out wet and citric but dries out endlessly leaving a cottony massively tangy (Orange Tang, actually) feeling at the finish.  As funky as could possibly be in the nose...difficult, but a must.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
4092,"2004-10-03",4.2,"Thanks to DrNate03 for driving us to Cantillon! January 2003 vintage from the barrel. Orange/apricot in color. Absolutely no head. Nose is very tart with strong fruit and wood notes, light leather and barnyard. Taste is very tart with mild fruit and leather notes but is not too over-the-top sour. Perhaps somepeach notes in there as well. Body is light with some mild acidity. Finish is slightly sour but not finishing as dry as expected. Some fainter fruit notes towards the end as well. Thanks to the Van Roys for getting this for us!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"

4092,"2003-11-06",3.9,"Warning this is a rating for the 1 year old Lambic, a completely different animal than the 3 year old found in the Bottle.  This is served from the cask at the brewery.  This one-year-old was quite mellow, the characteristic Cantillon acidity had yet to come into full force.  Served completely flat.  The beer released a musty sour aroma to my nose.  The taste though not overly acidic tasted of citrus.  Tasted slightly herbal as well, with a faint woodiness to it.  Definitely interesting to taste along with the other more aged products, still has a ways to go in the complexity department.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
