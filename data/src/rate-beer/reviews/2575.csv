2575,"2013-05-06",3.0,"In short: A sweet and very yeasty big blond ale that offers good drinkability but no excitement.
How: Bottle 750ml, corked & caged.  Consumed when approximately one year of age.  Bottle sent to me by tyler_mn, thanks Tyler.
The look: Cloudy blond-orange body topped by a very small white head.
In long: The timid nose is yeasty, a loaf of bread found in a wet basement, light spiciness, notes of printer paper.  Taste is very sweet, husky wheat grains, a lot of yeast, some old honey, straws, dead wild flowers, fruity notes of sweet apples, walking in a field chewing on a cattail, light spiciness, dusty sensation and also light barnyard notes.  Alcohol is well hidden.  Comfortable mouthfeel with plenty of very soft bubbles and a full yeasty pillowy body.  No bitterness to speak of.  For a 10% beer this was not very tasty at all.  Dangerously easy to drink, not because it is very good, more because it is very low intensity and inoffensive.  Something about the dominant yeast signature of this beer reminded very much me of the signature Unibroue yeast, and being a Quebecer I was raised in Unibroue yeast.  Nothing bad here, but nothing exciting either.  Im not impressed by this brewery but nonetheless I always keep a bottle of Olvalde in my fridge in case someone breaks into my house and I need a bottle I dont care about to break on his head.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2575,"2012-01-20",3.6,"Approximately half of a 25.4 oz. bottle, poured into a glass, as always (Ill save the remainder for tomorrow). Complex, juicy, floral, yeasty aroma features honey, white wine, apple juice, apple cider, white grape juice, bubblegum, cinnamon, tonic water, pretzel, and lemon scents. Adequately strong smell but not overwhelming. Pours a clear, pale gold/straw color with a moderate amount of bubbles that rise at a medium speed. Note that since I poured only half the bottle, and given that the beer is bottle-conditioned, I expect the second half of the beer to be cloudy or at least hazy. Long-lasting, uneven, frothy, off-white head. Produces good, thick, web-like lacing. The flavor is very sweet. Honey, champagne, white grape juice, golden raisin, and yellow plum elements present in the taste. Boozy , mineraly, and fruity with a spicy finish. Sweeter than ideal for me, although the sweetness thankfully does lessen in its intensity upon multiple sips. Salty aftertaste. Moderate body. Silky-smooth, soft, frothy, sharp, and lively in the palate. I suspect The Aurochs Horn will improve upon cellaring. As it was as I, having purchased it several months ago, tasted it, the beer is tasty, interesting, very Belgian-esque, but, ultimately, too overpoweringly sweet and boozy to earn a top-notch score from me.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

2575,"2011-09-06",4.1,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter.

Appearance: Mostly clear honey with bubbly, foamy head and great, sticky lacing.

Aroma: Extremely dry, slightly musty, with clove, pepper and light banana. Slightly metallic. Just a touch of mead.

Taste: Strongly mead-like, but remains more dry than sweet. The Belgian yeast plays a strong role, with a nice mustiness, complimented by clove and banana. Some other fleshy fruits, such as peach, are also evident, with a finish that is a touch peppery and spicy. Subtle but quite complex.

Palate: Moderately high carbonation, body is slightly syrupy but still light and refreshing considering the abv. Fairly dry finish and nicely warming.

Overall: This is a very distinct beer, blurring the lines between a Belgian Strong Pale Ale and a Braggot. Love to see a new Minnesota brewer hit the scene with something utterly unique. Cant wait to see what else they do.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

2575,"2011-09-05",3.8,"750 ml bottle thanks to Footbalm. Pours a clear golden color with a large white head. Somebody get me a damn Aurochs Horn to drink out of already! The aroma is a sweet banana ester, something akin to a triple with tons of honey. The flavor is a nice brew, very distinct; sweet honey, earthy dry malts with tons of fruity especially banana. Very drinkable and not hot. Pretty cool.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
2575,"2011-09-04",3.6,"Courtesy of Sparky. The 0.75L bottle pours copper hazy apricot juice with very thin white head. The aroma is wheated malts, soft yeasty spices, a touch of banana and some heat at the end of the draw. The taste runs quickly into sugary wheat notes with spicy yeast around the edges and smooth banana going on off in the background.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
2575,"2011-09-03",3.6,"Bottle shared by Sparky @ Daks Cantillon Tasting.  Bright 14 karat tangerine color with a bubble or two for a head.  Really unique brew that is tough to categories so Ill do what I normally do...rate it on whether I enjoyed it or not...style be damned!!!  The nose shows dark fruit, banana, clove, wheat, and caramel.  Lots of candied fruit in the flavor along with brown sugar, toffee, and honey.  Full bodied with a bit of finishing spice.  This one keeps you guessin.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"

Somewhat hot at times, smooth carbonation. Interesting, seems more belgian strong than traditional ale.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
2575,"2011-08-23",3.3,"750ml bottle.

It pours a brilliant gold color with a foamy white head that leaves some lacing.

The scent is mostly spices with some orange peel.

The flavor is big and malty. There are some nice fruit flavors and some spices, pretty basic and blunt.

Not bad.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
2575,"2011-08-23",3.6,"(750ml bottle shared by Sparky).  Pours a hazy apricot color with no head to speak of.  Aroma has honey, coriander, clove and banana.  Taste is sweet with some bitterness.

2575,"2011-07-14",3.8,"C&C bottle, poured to a tulip.  Light orange honey marmalade in color, with a pillowy white head that fades quickly and leaves little to no lacing.   Aroma is yeast, cloves, banana, floral sweetness, light toasty malt.  Taste is similar, though with a bit of floral hop bite.  The spicy yeast notes are enhanced with warmth. The sweetness of the honey is quite present, and is a bit too much for me.   Also a very light touch of caramel.  The 10% is not present overmuch on the palate,  but a definite warmth follows the beer down.  A really nice beer, one that I will get again for sure.
NOTE: As the beer warms, I begin to detect a slight bit of funk, both in the aroma and the taste, which really serves to add complexity to the beer.  Going to have to get one to age....","California, USA","LamarBurton"
2575,"2011-07-13",3.4,"Bottle.  Clear and golden in color with a wisp of a white head.  Light mineral notes in the aroma, clove, and honey.  Taste is fairly sweet.  Taste is honey, some candy sugar, clove, and bread.  This is 10% alcohol?  Medium body.  A tad sweeter than Id like, but still this is a pretty solid effort.","Minnesota, USA","mattyb83"
2575,"2011-07-05",3.6,"medium gold pour with a thick foamy white head that mostly fades away.
aroma is very tripel like. Yeasty, pale fruits, hints of honey and malt.
Honey and biscuity malt in the flavour. medium to high sweetness. A fair bit of fruit in there. Peach, pear. some bubblegum tones in the finish.
Very interesting and well done brew. Look forward to seeing more from him.","Lakeville, Minnesota, USA","Trev"
2575,"2011-06-23",3.6,"Bottle. I had heard about this beer and brewery but this is my first time having this beer. C&C bottle. Poured into a tulip glass a slightly hazed medium copper yellow color with a 1/2 finger white head that settles to leave a slight coaster. Banana, vanilla, and bubblegum in the nose. Distinctly belgian in aroma, thats for sure. Medium mouthfeel. Sweet, caramel, vanilla, honey like, banana, some spice, and hints of the alcohol round out the experience. Also get some apple and pear flavors. Overall, I like the flavors, but its a tad sweet and the bubblegum notes, at least for me, semi domintate this. The 10% also warms and lets you know it there.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
2575,"2011-06-21",3.8,"Belgian tripel like in flavor with a hint of honey, which is not dominant.  Fairly smooth palate.  Im interested to see what this brewer does next.  Seems like the brewery is located in a small town not too far from where I live.  Drinks better as it warms, which is generally the case with belgian styles.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"

2575,"2011-05-29",4.1,"Poured a hazy golden orange with a large white head. Smelled a little yeasty and a bit fruity with an underlying sharpness. Wow, this tastes fantastic! Theres a bit of honey under some fruit, wheat, and a pleasant dryness and the finish. A little hot yet so its kicking like a mule right now. Im going to buy this one again for sure. Cant wait to see what else they do.","Crystal, Minnesota, USA","Alopex"
2575,"2011-05-23",3.8,"There was a lot to like here.  I was surprised to find considerable complexity and attractiveness in the flavor profile, including some lovely yeast strains, clove and banana.  It felt a bit too hot yet--needs aging--but the honey gave a nice sweetness to it and there was sufficient life in the body.  A very promising first effort from this brewery.  Bottle.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

2575,"2011-04-30",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 25, 2012 (bottle)  Pours out a clear light gold with a medium white head that sticks around for awhile and leaves a good amount of lacing..  Aroma initially has this off-putting mustiness to it, but this lessens and is replaced by some more rounded sweetness to it, similar to pear.  Floral honey also makes its presence known and is a nice compliment to the scent of fruit.  Some carrot as well.  A note of spice also rises through in the aroma, and I believe this may be due to the alcohol.  Definitely some scorched sugar scent shows up with further warming, which again adds another pleasant dimension, and that mustiness is still present, which I think may be due to skunking as the bottle I purchased was near a window.  Took about an hour for this mustiness to leave entirely, and the aroma improved considerably once it left.  Flavor is lightly sweet, certainly not cloying, with a bit of peach, scorched caramel, slight honey, and faint bitterness on the finish.  Alcohol does not make its presence known in the flavor until the end of the finish, where a slight warming effect is displayed.  Mouthfeel is great, and was not too thick, with soft carbonation yielded through the bottle conditioning.  Overall, this is an impressive first showing from Olvalde, and I certainly look forward to trying more beers from this brewery.

(Edit:) Had to bump up the score as this has either really improved with age, or this batch Im drinking is particularly good.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
2575,"2011-04-15",4.1,"Sampled by the brewer at Heritage Liquor, 4/14/11.  I like the concept of this brewery, barrel aged beers in a barn setting.  I asked him to let the cobwebs grow and he thought I was kidding.  The first beer is a solid success.  Gold color and a large lead, almost opaque beer.  no visible sediment in the glass, but you can see it in the bottle.  Nice aroma, effervescent, with yeast and honey.  From the aroma, I am thinking it could be sour.  Flavor has more yeast, a brett character, but it is not sour, though the brewer admitted it might sour a little over time.  Unfiltered , which I like.  Sweet flavor, but not cloying.  Some honey, and clearly Belgian influenced.  Keep it up.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
2575,"2011-04-14",4.2,"Sampled and picked up a 750 ml bottle at Heritage Liquors in Maplewood, MN. Pours a semi-clear light golden amber colored brew with a fizzy and fluffy white head that has some excellent retention and leaves behind some spotty lacing. Aroma has a character of a Belgian dubbel, fruity esters, rock candy, a hint of white pepper, some banana, and slight trace of clove. Taste is medium to full bodied, not as Belgian style in taste compared to aroma but still have a fruity, light banana, ale yeast and a touch of clove. Carbonation is very well balanced. Finish has a mild spice aftertaste followed by some semi-sweet golden grain malt, yeast and even some honey. The honey presence hides the high 10% abv character which makes this an outstanding bottle conditioned strong ale. Most excellent!","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
