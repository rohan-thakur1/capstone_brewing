397,"2017-05-30",3.9,"Can at North River. Pours a hazed amber apricot gold with a medium sized white head. Fruity citrus, creamy wheat and soft melon. Slow citrus, soft wheat, musk. Tasty.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
397,"2017-03-04",3.5,"16 oz can I got in a trade as an extra. The pour is a golden orange color with a thinner light tan head and a couple spots of soapy lace as it falls down. The aroma is pretty decent. There is a light hoppiness and a little bit of juiciness to it. Its actually like a juicy IPA without a lot of the dryness and bitterness. They hit a nice balance here. The flavornis much of the same. Its got a bit of maltiness right up front and a hint of sweeter hops. Its a nice balance. The flavor is really what sets it apart from an IPA. The mouth feel is lighter and definitely creamy with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly malty and light hop finish. This is really well balanced and distinguishes itself. I like it.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
397,"2016-11-29",3.5,"Can. Pours quite hazy orange, small off white head, decent lacing. Aroma is pine and grapefruit zest. Flavor is medium sweet, medium bitter. Medium body. Basically a sweet DIPA. Cream ale my ass.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

397,"2016-07-26",4.2,"2015 BJCP Category: 34C Experimental Ale (base brew: 22A Double IPA)
AROMA: Hop-forward aroma of orange, though sweet like sherbet. Some light yeast esters. 10/12APPEARANCE: Basketball orange hue. Body is very cloudy with occasional CO2 bubble floating by. Large, white, frothy head which retains and laces well. 3/3FLAVOR: Described as a ""hoppy imperial cream ale,"" this more closely resembles a DIPA. Hop-forward throughout with a strong orange taste. Bitterness is pretty high, too. Body has a sturdy malt backbone, though not especially sweet or any malt distinctiveness. No hop bite, just a general high IBU sensation (~70?). No corn nor lager-like flavor whatsoever which makes me scoff at the cream ale marketing. 16/20MOUTHFEEL: Medium-full body with a noticeable viscosity - leaves me feeling full. Texture is velvety smooth as if it were on nitro. Alcohol warmth and taste is present, but complementary. Hops linger, but are not biting or harsh. 5/5OVERALL IMPRESSION: This is probably best considered a DIPA. It completely fails as a ""cream ale"" by any measure. Tasty and fun to drink. 8/10TOTAL SCORE: 42/50DISCLAIMER: The author is not a certified BJCP judge; therefore, this score sheet is not necessarily indicative of proper BJCP judging techniques and protocol.

397,"2016-07-08",3.9,"Tasted from can. Pours a murky gold with a nice white head. Aroma has some citrus notes of pineapple with caramel and sweet bready notes. Taste is well balanced and really tastes like an IPA. No way I would know this is a cream. Flavors of citrus fruit, caramel, molasses, pine on the finish. Chewy mouthfeel. Incredible cream.

397,"2016-06-10",3.7,"Can at Cannibal Gotham Market. Murky golden orange with a thick, creamy beige head and heavy lace. Boozy and doughy aroma, vanilla cake, some astringent hops, pine, and citrus. Finishes heavy bitter and pretty dry. Strong, boozy mouthfeel, average carbonation. Lots going on here, but it is pretty tasty.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

397,"2016-06-06",2.3,"Can from Cannibal West; shared with Linh and Ken. Pours a dirty amber gold with thick white lace. Nose is alcohol and grains - a bit off-putting. Mouthfeel is pretty abrasive - lots of alcohol, dirty grains, malt and thick sugar.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
397,"2016-05-26",3.5,"Nice piney aroma with notes of orange and tropical aromatics. Appearance is a hazy yellow gold with a good head retention. Flavor has plenty of hop flavors with the pine notes sticking out the most. Malt is sweet on the end with notes of cracker and biscuit. Mouthfeel is medium high with a medium level of carbonation. Overall, the beer has a great hop bouquet. I would have liked some of the citrus, tropical notes to come through more on the flavor. The beer's body would be better if it was lighter. Overall, it's a good beer.

397,"2016-05-13",2.6,"Drank from a pint glass, poured from a large can, split amongst three. Pours a nice clear, almost copper color, with nice head retention. Bit too much hop aroma for a cream ale. An alright brew, as per usual, overly hopped by Carton.","Long Valley, New Jersey, USA","N3lson1"
397,"2016-05-10",4.1,"16 ounce can. Pours a hazy orange gold color. Firm creamy white head with nice lacing. Big resiny hop nose. First sip brings a creamy mouthfeel and intensely bitter hop blast off. As the bitterness subsides, there is a bready, caramel maltiness that emerges. Farther along comes a rush of dank citrus hoppiness and warming alcohol. This is a complex, layered brew that really needs to be sipped slowly to reveal the many nuances. This aint no Genny Cream Ale. Excellent! A bit pricy at 18 bucks for four 16 ounce cans.","Hamilton Square, New Jersey, USA","gripweed57"

397,"2016-05-05",3.0,"Tallboy expensive ass can via a 4-pack from Spirits Brick. Poured a chunky, lightly hazed, deep rusty gold with a foamy white head. Aroma/flavor of yeast, old bread, stale tea, dry citrus. Aroma has some light fruit notes and pineapple rind also. Body has noticeable heat throughout, average carbonation, a big chewy mouthfeel and is just harsh in general. Definitely not worth the ridiculous $20.32 I spent on the 4-pack.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
