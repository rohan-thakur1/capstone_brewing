1238,"2008-06-29",3.7,"Tap at FFF brewpub. Dark opaque brown almost black with small beige head with those little bubbles and nice lace. Nice, sweet, fruity, malty  aroma with a big dose of alc and surpriaing red apple on top of the dark fruit. Flavor is med ium sweet dark fruit base with a semi-large alc note, some banana, but nice. Medium to full, creamy body, very nice. All around pretty well done, but the alc is a little too much.","Grand Rapids/Chicago, Michigan, USA","xnoxhatex"
1238,"2008-06-28",3.6,"This draft brew from the brewery poured a small sized head of foamy finely sized tan colored bubbles that were quickly diminishing and left behind a transparent uncarbonated brown colored body and a poor lacing. The mild aroma was malty. The crisp mouth feel was tingly at the start with a mellow finish and a bock like aftertaste. The thick flavor contained notes of malt hops sweet and dark malt. Good bock flavor.  Delicious and one I would certainly buy again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
1238,"2008-06-20",4.0,"Snifter on tap at FFF.  Beautiful doppelbock! Deep ruby-brown with only the vestiges of a caramel colored head.  Aroma is roasted malt and caramel.  Taste is sweet - but not cloying - with lots caramel, chocolate, and cane sugar leading to a subtle hop finish.  Mouthfeel is velvety, making it one of the most drinkable high-ABV beers Ive ever had.  Beautiful lacing, too, if thats important to you.","Williamston, Michigan, USA","sleestak"
1238,"2008-06-20",3.9,"On tap at FFF.  Darker reddish brown with a thin lighter cream colored head.  Fruity alcohol, light chocolate and malty sweetness.  Round.  Very subdued hops.  Creamy mouth, fine bubbles and lots of substance.  Creamy sweet rich malt.  Fruity alcohol.  A bit boozy.  Dark malt sweetness, some small chocolate.  Lingering heat.  A very nice doppelbock indeed.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"
1238,"2008-06-16",3.9,"On tap at the 3Fs brewpub. The body was deep rusty brown with a tan head. The aroma was caramel with cherry notes. This was like a strong Tootsie Roll. The taste was Tootsie Roll with some caramel. There was also a little bit of peanuts and toast. Not at all subtle, but what else would one expect form Three Floyds?","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
1238,"2008-06-12",3.8,"Ruby color with white lacing. Very powerful with a chocolate and cofee taste. Very heavy and good!","Asheville, North Carolina, USA","TikiE"
1238,"2008-06-10",3.9,"On tap at the brewpub:  Black in color with a thin head.  There were sweet scents of chocololate, coffee, figs and rock candy.  The palate was nicely balanced and rich with good weight and body.","Wheaton, Illinois, USA","SQNfan"
1238,"2008-06-01",3.7,"Good dopplebock but flavor depth wasnt there for me.  Had it on tap at the brewery. Good effort but not a favorite.  on tap","Indiana, USA","BigBang"
1238,"2008-05-26",4.3,"This is an awesome beer. Pours a dark black brown color with amber highlights and a light caramel colored medium sized head. Nose is chocolate, caramel, dark malt, and sugar. Taste is the same as the nose and is sweet and the mouthfeel is chewy and sticky. This is a great doppelbock and at 9.5% the alcohol content is invisible.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
1238,"2008-05-25",3.6,"8 oz. draft snifter at 3Fs. Deep brown color, no head after a minute in a glass. Malty smell, of course. Light Tootsie Roll fudge taste as advertised. Fresh yeast taste kind of hold it back from total excellence. Bitterness is delivered in unusual prickly bubbles right on my lips instead of the tongue. Slight notes of cherry and Raisinettes arise after a while, then a smooth prune juice impression. Bitter pinprick bubbles stay on to the end.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
1238,"2008-05-25",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 17, 2008 Extremely good.  Full of flavor, chocolate, coffee, caramel, dark fruit, etc.  I enjoyed this extremely too much to have to drive back to Ohio.","Alaska, USA","12many"
1238,"2008-05-24",4.0,"Draft.  Garnet/Brown color with small tan head.  Roasted caralmel in aroma.  Sweet caramelly, dark fruit flavors with an earthy hop finish.","Pickerington, Ohio, USA","BabyJoe692"
1238,"2008-05-21",4.2,"In short: Rich, full and highly drinkable Doppelbock.  One of the best ever.
How: Tap at brewpub
The look: Dark mahogany body with a small tan head
In long: Luscious dark caramel, plenty of figs and dates, some chocolate.  Body is as full as it can be, this is almost a meal.  A big condensed fruit cake will a little chocolate topping.  A truckload of leafy hops provide a fresh green finish.  I went through my glass in about 5 minutes.  A strong beer like that should not be so highly drinkable, thats just too dangerous.  Just too highly drinkable, the dudes at 3F probably had a party with that thing on tap all night and the day after they came up with the name.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1238,"2008-05-12",3.5,"tap at brewery.  mahogony pour with lacing.  dark fruit, malty aroma.  rich malts, bitter, salty(strange), dark fruits.  thick body.  I enjoyed it more as it warmed.","Littleton, Colorado, USA","waolsen"
1238,"2008-05-05",3.8,"DLD 08: Pours a hazy brown with an off white head. Aroma, fruits, caramel, roasted notes, toffee. Flavor, caramel, fruity notes, roasted malts, toffee, some nutty hints, and earthy hops. Pretty solid.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
1238,"2008-04-30",3.6,"Bottle DLD 08 Mostly clear, burnt orange lager with a large, wispy, white head. Great, chunky retention. Notes of golden raisins, fuzzy fruits, cocoa and citrus fruits make up the nose. Full-bodied with a lightly creamy mouthfeel. Rich chocolate malt and caramel malt flavor with balance provided by inconspicuous hops. The finish is sweet, but also fairly clean.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1238,"2008-04-30",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2009 Description from the brewpub says ""A massive malty dopplebock, notes of tootsie rol, unsweetend chocolate and cocoa powder in this lager"" and thats exactly what this one is. All the smooth and creaminess of a dopplebock, with lots of malt and chocolate for added character. Big on flavor and punch. Looks like geletin in the glass, but drinks smooth as can be. Warm and filling, the three different chocolates add a great depth of chocolate flavor here, each sip gives up something different. A nice yeast and toffe flavor adds to the malt and bring everything in balance. This one is simply awesome.","Indiana, USA","StFun"
1238,"2008-04-29",3.9,"Pours a light brown with ruby highlights. Smell is toffee, slight cocoa and some dark malts.  This was my favorite from this trip.  I really enjoyed this beer.  Everything melded and went well together.  Clean and pleasant on the mouthfeel.  This was an enjoyable sipper.  I wish they would bottle this stuff.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AllAboutStout"

1238,"2008-04-29",3.8,"This wasnt a weak dopplebock. They described it on the menu as having a lot of characteristics similar to a tootsie roll.  I would agree.  Aroma was chocolate and sweet malt.  taste was dark fruit, chocolate, slight banana, and a sweet finish.","Holt, Michigan, USA","masonjer"

1238,"2008-04-21",3.2,"Deep brown pour topped by a thin tan head that dissapated slowly.  the nose was sweet malts, dark fruits and touch of smoke.   The flavors were largely on the overly sweet side...dark fruits, raisins, caramel, molasses, etc.   A bit too sticky sweet for my liking, but thats the style.  The alcohol is substantial but not overwhelming.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
1238,"2008-04-14",3.9,"Tap @ Three Floyds Brew Pub Dark brown pour with no head. Malty, sweet taste hints of raisens and stone fruit.  Full mouthfeel with bready yeast hanging around.  Very enjoyable.","Lisle, Illinois, USA","bwkrieger"

1238,"2008-03-29",3.7,"On tap at Three Floyds Brewpub and served in a snifter.  This beer poured a dark brown with a thin head of tan foam that lasted throughout most of the glass.  A fair amount of light lacing was left behind.  The aroma of the beer was made up of chocolate, caramel, dark fruit, and some alcohol.  The flavor was much the same with an added note of earthy, bready yeast.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied and smooth with light carbonation.  Interesting and tasty.","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

1238,"2008-03-03",3.9,"Pours a deep brown with reddish highlights and an eggshell head that was part creamy, part big bubbled.  It had a bready, sweet aroma, chocolate with dark malt and burnt wood.  It got mayhaps a bit too sweet up front in the flavor, but a smokey bitterness arose that balanced it out.  Interesting to have a doppelbock at a ""living ale"" festival.

Nose is yeasty, caramels, chocolate, and light burnt malts.  The nose isnt too strong, but the flavor makes up for it.  Creamy chocolate flavors.  Bakers chocolate, sweet caramels, malty, toasted, biscuit, and charred malts.  Wow, this is tasty.  This is one of the best doppelbocks that Ive had.  I need a whole pint of this stuff.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"
