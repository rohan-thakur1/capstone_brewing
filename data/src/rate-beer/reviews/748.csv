748,"2014-09-26",3.1,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2014 Bottle: Solid amber with golden highlights; muddled, capped with a huge, frothy, slowly forming eggshell-white foam. Sticky lacing all over. Lightly leafy & mildly citric hops on the nose with some pepper orange & citrus peel. Spicy & moderately herbal profile from the rye which blunts the hops quite & bit, adding plenty of dryness. Mellow flavor; lots of white pepper covered citrus peel with a mid-palate full of spicy & toasted rye bread, grain, & semi-sweet malt that leadings into a dry finish as the rye gains some steam. A little caramel? Some piny & oily hops show themselves again in the aftertaste, but this beers latter half is dominated by the aggressive rye. Decent ""rye"" IPA, but I typically dont favor the heavy addition of rye into beers. This one was alright, though.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
748,"2014-06-13",3.3,"Bottle. Pours cloudy gold/orange, with a white head. Aroma is citrusy hops and sugar. Flavor is hops, rye, sugar. Medium to thin body.","Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA","zathrus13"

748,"2013-11-25",3.4,"Hazy apricot with a quickly fading white topper. Aroma of rye, citrus, caramel, pale malts and mild noble hops. Taste is on the grainy side with rye, caramel and pale malts, Kinda bland with a middle of the road bitter finale.","Oak Creek, Wisconsin, USA","esjaygee"
748,"2013-08-24",4.1,"Draft at HopCat in East Lansing. The pour is a medium gold, no real head or lacing. The smell is very hoppy and with quite a bit of hops. The rye comes through on the end of the nose and Id very prominent in the taste. The hoppyness contributes to the dry finish, and it lingers a tad, just like what Id want","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
748,"2013-05-31",3.8,"Nice aroma of citrus, rye bread.  The appearance is slightly cloudy orange, white head.  The flavor is orange peel, grapefruit, rye bread.  The finish is citrus, spicy.  Slightly thicker than medium in body, creamy mouthfeel.  Nicely done.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"

748,"2013-05-07",3.7,"Pour is hazy copper orange with an off white head. Nose is pungent, tons of orange citrus hops and some floral notes with faint rye backbone. Taste is much spicier, hops are a bit more subdued, notes of grain and some malt underneath. Bitterness lingers through a moderately carbonated finish on a light body.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"
748,"2013-05-01",4.3,"12 oz. bottle. Appearance is golden amber with an orange hue. There is a paper-thin white head. The aroma is rich grapefruit, other citrus, light pine, and bit of rye spiciness. The taste is similar. However, the rye is more prominent, and there is some bitter hops taste. Very smooth, lightly crisp feel. A very high quality beer.","Lansing, Michigan, USA","marv3mania"
748,"2013-04-16",3.5,"The beer is golden with clusters of carbonation bubbles. Thick off white head that leaves lace ringlets cascading down the pint glass. The aroma offers citrus, toasted grain, light pine & hops. The flavor is more aggressive / bold than the aroma. Nice showing from the rye malt. Well balanced and drinkable. Toasted grain with some bitter hops in the finish. A tad sweet. Overall, pretty good.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
748,"2013-04-16",3.5,"Bottle.  Reddish amber color.  Small thin white head.  Hop, citrus and rye aroma with a little citrus.  Tastes much the same with bitterness that lingers a bit longer than I would have preferred.","Michigan, USA","RespertFTW"
748,"2013-04-14",3.7,"Tap at Wheatberry, Buchanan MI
Pours a gorgeous darker orange with medium head and thin lacing. Taste is very balanced with ample malt but the hop presence still rings through. Solid finish that does not linger too long

748,"2013-04-11",3.6,"12oz bottle, thanks to umich03jm. Bottled 2/18/13. Poured into my spiegelau IPA glass (first time using this thing). Mostly hazy orange color. Good thin off white head. Nice spread of lace. Medium body. Good, smooth lighter carbonation. More dry in the finish. Very smooth and easy to drink. Lightly spicy rye malt aroma. Light toast. Good citrus hop aroma, light grass. Nice, balanced drinkable rye IPA. Sweet taste, little bitter. Nice light rye toasty spiciness. As it often happens with Shorts brews, I finished this way too quickly and I wish I had more still to judge it on. Thats a good problem to have.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
748,"2013-04-04",4.0,"On tap.  Aroma has notes of spicy rye malts, caramel, citrus hops.  Medium amber orange hue with an average white head that left good lace.  Flavor is very sweet and bitter.  Palate is full bodied and oily with an average carbonation.  Overall a very good rye brew.  Loved it.","Saginaw, Michigan, USA","polomagnifico"
748,"2013-04-02",4.1,"12oz Bottle. Thanks Sean! Hop aroma that leans lightly citrus, but more spice infused, a la cilantro, lemongrass, and fennel. Flavors produce a similar profile, a little more controlled and subdued, extra fresh and juicy. I like this. Im imagining some earthy spice from the Rye is contributing to the overall zesty complexity of this beer, but its hard to tell. Whatever case, the emergent flavor profile and accompanying dry texture works. Its fresh, full of juice, and delightful.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
748,"2013-04-01",3.8,"Pours a hazy orange-gold with a thin eggshell head that settles to a ring and leaves some clingy, soapy lace. Nose involves some dust and rye spice, citrus and tropical fruit notes, a touch dank, but mostly subdued on the aromatics over all. Some sweetness, but more toward the bitter side. Lighter bodied, average carb, vibrant, with a lingering drying and spicy bitterness. Extremely easy to drink, quenching, refreshing. A little more out of the nose would make this more enjoyable, but nice as is.","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"
748,"2013-03-25",3.9,"Appearance: Super hazy orange color. The beer simply glows when held up to light due to the amount of haze.
Aroma: Citrus-y rye, and thats pretty much the best way to describe it.
Taste: Most definitely a rye beer. It should sound absolutely disturbing, but since the beer as a whole is quality it forgives it, but the initial taste reminds me of vomit -- very acidic. After that, tropical hops mix with the rye to make for a pleasant-to-drink rye.
Feel: Decent amount of carbonation here, and a nice, smooth feel to it. Nothing too spectacular, but it works very well with this particular rye.
Overall: Rye Not? is a beer that Im glad to have tried. Im not a HUGE fan of rye beers, but I like to try them every now and again. This beer looks good, smells good, and tastes pretty decent. Not the best rye beer in the world, but no doubt one thats drinkable.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"
748,"2013-03-21",3.8,"Appearance: solid orange to tan pour with quarter inch whitish orange head. Super cloudy, almost does not pass light.

Aroma: simple but good: strong juicy citrus hop and floral hop aroma. 

Taste: sweet citrus hop with a ton of malted rye bitterness. Perfect blend.

Palate: medium body, moderate carbonation, creamy and oily mouth feel, just slightly dry on finish. 

Overall: 12oz bottle from Kalamazoo MI drakes party center. Fairly awesome rye IPA, high recommendation.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","bwa5879"
748,"2013-03-14",3.9,"Pours light ruby and cloudy. Nose is light rye, pepper and grapefruit. Taste is big rye at beginning then smacked by the 84 IBUs of hippy goodness. Big grapefruit and a little rye spiciness to finish with a little sweet malt.","Norton Shores, Michigan, USA","Ostomo517"

748,"2013-03-10",4.1,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 2/18/2013.  Pours lightly hazy golden amber color with a small fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a tin cap that lingers.  Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass.  Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, pine, floral, spicy rye, honey, light caramel, and bread.  Damn nice aromas with great complexity of hop notes with good malt balance.  Taste of tangerine, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, floral, light pine, spicy rye, honey, bread, and floral earthiness.  Fair amount of citrus bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, floral, light pine, spicy rye, honey, and bread on the finish for a good bit.  Damn nice hop flavor complexity with a good malt balance; only a moderate rye presence that is nice; and zero cloying flavors present after the finish.  Medium carbonation and body; with a creamy and lightly sticky mouthfeel that is nice.  Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming noticed after the finish.  Overall this is an excellent rye IPA.  Very nice hop flavor complexity and balance of malt with moderate rye; and very smooth to drink.  A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
748,"2013-03-09",3.7,"Bottle:  The aroma consists of moderate-heavy citrus (orange and lemon), light-moderate herbal notes, rye,  grass, and light woodiness.  It pours a mostly transparent orange with a touch of haze.  It has a one finger orange-tinged off-white head that quickly fades to a thin film.  There is some tiny dotted lacing left on the sides of the glass.  The flavor starts with moderate orange and light lemon.  The finish has light-moderate grapefruit, rye, herbal notes, and some light floral/grassiness.   Its light-medium bodied with mild carbonation and a somewhat soft mouthfeel.  Im generally not a huge rye IPA fan, but this one is pretty solid.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
748,"2013-03-07",3.4,"Bottle pour to pint glass.  Clean, medium gold; simple head. Aroma: big citrus nose.  Taste: rye dominates, but not grainy tasting (but grainy on the palate); balanced by hoppiness. A nice beer.","Lansing, Michigan, USA","blackflag321"
748,"2013-03-03",3.4,"Bottle. Reddish caramel color with small white head. Floral, hops, citrus and rye aromas. Lots of grain and rye in the flavor. Muted hoppy finish.","Michigan, USA","Mittenator"
748,"2013-02-28",3.8,"Bottle.  Pours a clear golden orange a small head that fades quickly.  Aroma is very spicy and bready with some grapefruit and oranges too.  The citrus comes out much more in the taste and matches really well with the spicy rye.  This tastes a lot like Shorts Richs Rye, did they just change the name?  Finish is very bitter and dry, a little too much.  Really tasty rye beer that takes rye to the extreme.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"

748,"2012-08-12",3.9,"Sampled from the tap at the 15th annual MBGSF. Pours a clear amber with a tan head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has bitter pine hops with a hint of grass and grapefruit backed by a nice rye note. Flavor has a nice combination of rye and grapefruit with some pine up front and more of the rye coming out in the finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
748,"2012-08-02",3.5,"Draft at the brewpub. Murky orange-brown body, medium-thin creamy buff head. Grapefruit and citrus nose. Malty, toasty body, rich with herbal and citrusy hops and a bitter leafy, somewhat catty finish. Fair complexity; tasty. Quite good.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
