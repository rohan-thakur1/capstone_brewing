 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance- The beer pours a nice deep amber color with a one finger just off white head. The head fades rather fast leaving only a thin film of foam on the top of the brew and almost no lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The smell is heaviest of a bready and caramel aroma. Mixed with these smells are some grainy aromas as well as a little bit of a lemon citrus smell.

 Taste  The taste begins with a grainy and toasted bready flavor mixed with a caramel sweetness. As the flavor advances a little bit of an herbal taste as well as some grassy flavors come to the tongue. The caramel fades during the coming of the grass and herb, but is replaced by a light dark fruit flavor. In the end, with a little bit of citrus and toasted nut coming to the tongue a nice toasted malty and sweeter flavor is left to linger on the tongue. 

 Mouthfeel  The body of the brew is on the medium to slightly creamier side with a carbonation level that is rather average. The feel is quite nice for the roasted and sweet flavors of the brew all while maintaining a great easy drinking feel.

 Overall  A rather pleasant and easy drinking amber ale.","","Darkmagus82"

This was poured into a pilsener glass. 
There was a two and a half finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute leaving some light somewhat foamy lacing clinging to the glass. 
The smell has a large amount of roasted caramel flavors presenting themselves in front of a toffee to nutty sort of flavoring. Light grassy/earthy bitter hops lightly dosed. 
The taste was mainly sweet and malty bringing back the nuttiness and the roasty caramel flavors. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. The aftertaste was semi - dry with a long drying finish. 
Overall, LTD series by Full Sail, solid Vienna Lager and now my interest is piqued in more of this series. Sure hope, this is just a precursor of whats yet to come...Full Sail send more LTD series beers.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1780,"2013-02-25",3.8,"May 16th, 2012 - A good amber is an amber that shines in a dull, brown and monotonous crowd. The amber is the safe style and the go-to 6-pack that lets a party hosted appeal just a little bit to all palates, rather than exceeding expectations for just a few drinkers. But Full Sails LTD Series Lager Recipe Number 5 is a cut above the mundane ambers that crowd the refrigerated section of my local grocery stores. Its an experimental recipe - whatever tinkering they conducted yielded a wonderful new take on the traditional amber; its a beer that engages the palate, rather than just slaking some vague thirst for beer. Dark chocolate brown in color, the depth and murkiness suggests that this brew might be thick with something - flavor, palate, gravity, its as yet unknown. Exploring the aroma, I find brown sugar and a heavy malta aroma, with the scent of fresh grass and sod. A dribble of honey appears in the aroma too, suggesting this is going to be a very sweet beer on the tongue. My suspicious are confirmed on the first sip. Lots of that rich maltiness comes to play on the palate, complemented by a mound of brown sugar, a breakfast oatmeal sweetness, a ribbon of caramel, and some glazed peaches and apricots., I overuse this word, but it fits so well here: toothsome. This is a sweet, delicious deep beer that has considerably improved the reputation and lot of ambers everywhere.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

1780,"2012-06-02",1.6,"Deep copper and light brown coloured body with a nice copper glow and a thick, three centimetre tall light brown head - nice looking, especially for a lager (given, its a vienna). Aroma of funky corn and wheat with a pungent sour milk and lactic smell that shows a bit of sugars and way too many odd scents. Light-bodied; Sharp metallic note with a lot of nuts and earth noticeable, showing off a little caramelised sweetness at the end and a bitter nutty flavour at the end, not great. Aftertaste is potent and not in a good way - too many off flavours and not enough holding this together.

1780,"2012-04-22",3.3,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2013 Well, as with their Bohemian Pils (LTD 03), evidently this has also been retooled. This batch features very malt-rich, breadcrusty characters which hint at melanoidins and scream blackstrap molasses. Good depth to the malt as well, as its quite dextrinous in feel. Dextrins are dusty and help to absorb the residual sugars. Quite candyish, but has a crunchy dark malt character that teeters on coffee and helps to balance with stiff definition.   On the sweet side of the spectrum, but a well-integrated Saaz-like softness  cleans things up. The previous batch was extremely unclean and riddled  with horrid defects, but this is markedly improved. So glad that Full Sail is doing some reflecting  and making adjustments where deemed necessary.  Purty nice, especially for $6 a sixer. Rusty gold. Nicely sustained fluffy white head. Bumbling and congested aromas of spent tealeaves, wet paper, metal, tomato, plum skin, cherry cough syrup, dried leather. Some minor sulfur and hairspray fusels, as well. A displeasing twangy fruitiness precedes a vague medicinal sharpness upfront. Shades of breadcrust along with a nut-skin earthiness lend the faintest bit of crispness, though the limp pale malt overshadows any semblance of refinement with a lifelessness which brings to mind wet paper and Communion bread wafers. Malt is strikingly devoid of any dextrinous heft or definitionjust plain fuzzy, dull, seriously underattenuated and riddled with soupy caramel, as well. No scratchiness from the hops, and absolutely no dextrins to dust the palate and contrast worth the overpowering red licorice slickness and Red Delicious dullness. Quite vegetal, as well. Closes limp with a vapid continuation of wet paper pale malt and spent tealeaves from the excess caramel malt. A very sweet, estery and, frankly, foul lager. Now, I will gladly tolerate some esters in lager if the beer is cleanly fermented, i.e. has room for them.  Unfortunately, in this case, the beer is already sweet and overcrowded, and the esters only add to the muddled character. But thats only one of many the things amiss here. Very shabby and generic.

Nose was indistinct fruit and a hint of dry zest, with grain and malts underpinning. Body was medium, with carbonation fading a bit too quickly.

This 12-ouncer came from my sister as a birthday gift as part of a mixed pack, and you know, it may be one of the better in the bunch.  Excellent clear dark reddish-amber in color with a small light khaki head and good lacing.  The aroma has nice caramel malts and mild toast.  Not too shabby, I must say.  The flavor is also very good.  A little grainy with caramel, toast and some earthy hops.  Just the right sweet/bitter balance.  Rather dry on the mouthfeel with medium body for the style.

Medium bodied, yet still very full feeling, smooth, creamy palate, perfect session lager feel.  Flavor has a distinct caramel presence, but it is very nicely done, not artificial or cloying, just tastes good.  Also plenty of toast, hay, and a crisp bite thanks to the hops, which impart a very subtle bitterness on the finish.

Body was balanced, crisp, fresh, satisfying and had a delightful, but not overbearing Vienna fruit edge to it that added a fun touch too the beer without getting weird, as I think it does from brewers who arent good at lagers or who dont know how to malt the style. This works. Drinkable, seasonable (as opposed to being a sticky, somewhat boozy bock), and fresh.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
