1331,"2016-10-26",3.2,"Bottle... Clear dirty-orange pour with a tiny, creamy, off-white head. The aroma is spicy, herbal and lightly smoky. Im also picking up some strange anise component here. Light-bodied with vibrant carbonation. The flavor is a blend of toffee and honey sweetness tempered by herbal, tannic bitterness. Finishes bittersweet with a rumor of butterscotch that lingers.

1331,"2015-06-09",3.8,"Chestnut / mahogany body with a half inch of tan head. Caramel, brown sugar, bread, mild spice. Tasty beer. Medium bodied. Bready with mild sweetness. Solid.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
1331,"2015-05-15",3.5,"12oz bottle. Pours brown with a small ring of tan lacing. Aroma is of smoke, ginger, chocolate, and malt. Smells good. Taste is very malty, with a lot of smoke. Also has some chocolate. Lots of ginger on the linger. Surprisingly balanced. Not overly smoky, and easy to drink. Body is thin, but not watery. Seems like it would be stronger than it is. I enjoyed it.","Burbank, Illinois, USA","BeerBunker"
1331,"2015-03-10",3.4,"I normally don?t go for smoked brews, but it?s subtle and complimentary in this one. Flavors of caramel, orange peel, brown sugar, burnt toast, ginger snaps and light smoke.","","ColovianTrader"
1331,"2015-03-05",3.0,"Too much ginger. Some hops, but just about no smoke. Dark brown, clear color. Bottle. Modest head.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","milewide"
1331,"2015-03-01",3.2,"bottle shared with hakes and lamont at club w, sunday dinner, lobster! pours clear dark red with thin white head, bitter, and different, subtle ginger, not bad, but Scottish isn my style also","Des Moines, Iowa, USA","boozedude"
1331,"2015-02-19",4.1,"Ive been sniffing this beer before every sip, caramel smoked and ginger really pack a punch, still smooth and nothing bitter because of the mass amount of malt, well done shorts good beer!","Howell, Michigan, USA","lukedarock"
1331,"2015-02-10",3.2,"Bottle from mikem409, thanks Mike! Pours reddish brown with a beige head leaving some spotty lace. Aroma has ginger and brown sugar and light caramel. Other spices show through. Sweet and spicy. Taste is of muted sweet caramel, some ginger and some peat. Medium bodied with a touch of an alcohol presence. Finishes sweetly tangy without much length. Fair brew, not great for style or for the brewery. 13.2","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"
1331,"2015-01-29",3.6,"Pours a brown color with a thin white foam head. Aroma is caramel, smoke, and some ginger. The ginger stands out more in the flavor, where theres also smoke, caramel, and a touch of bitterness. My main complaint is that the beer is watery thin. Otherwise the unique flavor comes out great, with the ginger adding a nice accent to the overall beer.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","chucklemation"
1331,"2015-01-27",3.3,"Bottle. Deep red pour with almost no head. Aromas are pest smoke, caramel, and toffee. Taste like smoked meat with some light toffee and moderate ginger. Thin to medium body. Decent.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
1331,"2015-01-09",4.0,"Bottle from BlowOffTube, thanks for the opportunity! 
Mostly clear deep reddish brown color. Big caramel and toffee, with hints of cocoa, smoke and ginger. Lots going on here and it just works.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
1331,"2015-01-06",3.8,"Similar to nicee spicy, was considered bitter by one taster but was the roasted note to others.","","BoroZillacate"
1331,"2015-01-05",3.9,"12 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 11/14/2014. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy deep reddish copper color with a 2 finger fairly dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, plum, apple, ginger, wood smoke, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast/spice earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready/smoked malt, ginger, and fruity yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, raisin, plum, apple, ginger, wood smoke, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast/spice earthiness. Light earthy herbal/spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown bread, nuttiness, ginger, wood smoke, raisin, plum, apple, herbal, and yeast/spice earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice robustness and complexity of dark/bready/smoked malt, ginger, and fruity yeast flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice spiced Scottish ale style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/smoked malt, ginger, and fruity yeast flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
1331,"2014-12-31",3.5,"Faint smoke aroma mixes with caramel and toffee. Pours a murky red with an almost non-existent off-white head. The smoke is more pronounced in the flavor of the beer, coming on strong and helping to subdue the sweet malts. Lingering smoke finish, with a medium body. Overall, the ginger and the smoke mask the Scottish ale side of this beer, making it more of a smoke beer.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","Nephilium"
1331,"2014-12-29",3.5,"12 oz bottle. Pours a hazy copper with an off-white head. Caramely malt, toffee aroma with some ginger. Flavor has the ginger, but not too much of it, and balances it against the lightly smoky toasty malt. Works pretty well.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"
1331,"2014-12-28",3.2,"Bottle pour from Shorts variety pack 7. Quite a thin body here, with less toffee and caramel notes than I was expecting. Perhaps a light version of a Scottish ale in a sense. Would like to try on draft to see if there is more to it as I was somewhat underwhelmed here.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Barnoloid"
1331,"2014-12-26",3.9,"12oz. bottle. Pours a rusty water color with an off white head. Aroma is very spice dominant. Taste is spice dominant as well with ginger and all-spice. Palate is medium to full bodied. Overall a great interpretation of the style. Will get again.","Portland, Michigan, USA","BrownALEx"
1331,"2014-12-26",3.3,"Sweet malty nose, big malty flavor with floral hops and lingering ginger long after the sips been swallowed, hop bitters cut straight through this malt bomb, smoked malt flavor is very subtle - which is much preferable to the alterntive. This is a great easy drinkin ale, though way hoppier than a Scottish ale should be, and the ginger makes it one that youll likely stop drinking after a pint and move on to something with a little less going on","Seattle, Washington, USA","AlabastorJones"
1331,"2014-12-24",2.9,"Bottle: The aroma consists of caramel, toffee, ginger, light smoke, chocolate, and dark fruit. It pours a transparent dark copper with a one finger beige head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a thicker ring. There is some dotted lacing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with somewhat bland and watery toffee and caramel flavors. There is a touch of chocolate in the middle. The finish has light-moderate woody/floral flavors with mild smoke and barely a touch of ginger. Its light-medium bodied with mild carbonation. Overall, Im generally not a big fan of Scottish Ales and Im not digging the woody/floral finish on this one.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
1331,"2014-12-23",2.9,"Bottle: Ruby-tinted copper body, mostly clear & topped with a one-finger khaki foam that fades quickly to a film & collar. Aroma full of caramel, campfire smoke, toffee, mild woodsiness, a very slight dark fruit element, & a bit of candied ginger. Flavor is a little thin up front. Starts off with some light caramel & bitter ginger rind. Mild notes of prune, toasted nuts, & toffee, too. Slightly earthy. Smoked aspect grows towards the finish; aftertaste is mostly smoked wood, char, & a bit of leftover toffee malt. A little strange.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
1331,"2014-12-17",3.4,"spicy aroma. Dont like the color too much. Looks like rusty water. Bitter spicy flavor. A little thicker on the palate than the appearance.","Harper Woods, Michigan, USA","mvp"
1331,"2014-12-16",3.7,"I like this beer. The color is a deep carmel see through red. With a creamy head on pour. Scent wasnt my favorite but the taste and finish make up for it.The ginger and smoked malt are there but not overpowering. Nicely balanced very tasty.","Ypsilanti, Michigan, USA","colemanbeer"
1331,"2014-12-10",3.7,"12 oz bottle....this pleasantly dry (for a Scots) mingles some smoky pungency with spicy ginger over a malty backbone to create a very complex brew that is none-the-less very drinkable. Good stuff.","Peoples Republic of Bloomington, Indiana, USA","paintedmaple"
1331,"2014-11-13",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a dark caramel brown with a minimal head. Taste and aroma of smokey malt, ginger and,caramel. Nicely balanced.","Bellaire, Michigan, USA","bpar73"
1331,"2014-10-27",3.3,"Tap. Very deep amber with small head. Malty base with some caramel and toffee. Medium hop bitterness. Its decent, but I dont know who seeks these kinds of beers out. Nothing too distinctive.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"

1331,"2010-12-19",3.5,"Draft sample. Poured clear dark brown color with medium frothy off-white head that mostil lasted with good lacing. Medium to heavy aroma of toasted malt. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium dark toasted sweet malt flavor with a medium toasted sweet finish of moderate duration.
