2547,"2016-10-24",3.0,"Bottle. 2.7%. Best before 18.02.17. Pours a slightly hazy amber/golden, with an off-white/yellowish head. Good lacing. Crispy (citrus) hop aroma, on a background of fruit, malt and light cereals. Feels a bit dusty and/or earthy. Flavour is sweetish, fruity and hoppy; the hops are a bit funky/cheesy. Light metallic overtone. Bitter hop finish. Hint of liquorice. Lingering light grassy note. Overall okay, although (despite?) the low alcohol content is noticable. Decent hop profile. 24.10.16.","Frederikssund, DENMARK","NosirIwont"
