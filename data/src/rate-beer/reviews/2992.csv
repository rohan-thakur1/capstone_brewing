2992,"2017-05-17",3.0,"From old tasting notes. Deep golden color with a big foamy white head. Good hoppy nose has a fruity character. Malty semisweet flavor upfront. Finish is clean and lightly tangy. Sour malt aftertaste.","Hamilton Square, New Jersey, USA","gripweed57"
2992,"2014-04-16",2.4,"12oz can (Old Notes)-Pours golden with no head. Aroma of sweetness. Taste of the same with alcohol. This light to medium bodied brew is not a bad malt liquor. Light you up.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","Headbanger"
2992,"2014-03-10",2.1,"always knew where we had gone to drink this when I was a kid. We just followed the trail of puke. Has to be drunk cold and fresh. Gets the job done but ditch the flat backwash no matter what. Only American beer I could get my cousins from the UK hammered on. Does taste like booze, oily and burns the roof of your mouth but has improved flavor over I remember it.","New York, USA","The6packSaint"
2992,"2006-08-21",2.0,"12 oz. can. When I was in college, we used to drink these and say ""lets go out and maximize.""  Twenty five years ago, this was the strongest beer you could find. The alcohol is not at all hidden, there is a definite burn. Really not a bad beer, but lets face it, if youre drinking this one, youre looking to get lit!","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
2992,"2006-04-30",1.8,"Oh, god.  What a beer this is.  I can feel my head pounding in the morning after splitting a 22 oz. of this and moving on to utica club.  I believe that the exact flavour profile of this beer has become completely blurred in my mind due to a painfully high number of cigarettes smoked that evening.  In short, this beer exists to get you drunk.  The $2.18 plus deposit and tax that two of these babies cost you will bring you a morning of pain, regret and blank shame.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","redbarista"
2992,"2004-08-03",1.3,"I actually liked this malt liquor when I tried it.  Then again I was on a drinking binge with a bunch of like minded Neanderthals.  Goes great with chocolate cake for breakfast.  Well, maybe Matt wont be using that in their next ad campaign.","Florida, USA","mongkut4"
2992,"2003-06-23",3.1,"8.99%, three of these 24 oz bottles and you will be swinging from the trees.  This stuff really blew me away.  Taste is a little overpowering, but when you're good and banged up, does it really matter?","Walltham, Massachusetts, USA","ChrisD"
2992,"2003-02-02",1.5,"While doing my Colt 45 review I remembered this beer from the 80's.  It was harsh, but the fastet buzz from beer I ever had.  I'm glad I have not seen it since.","Rochester, New York, USA","Ron"
2992,"2002-11-06",4.7,"This is by far the best beer to buy if you want to get hammered...hands down","Rochester, New Hampshire, USA","Gearwar"
2992,"2002-10-17",5.0,"This stuff will knock your socks off, 8.99% alcohol by volume......I really cant say anything else","USA","Intense1DKE99"
