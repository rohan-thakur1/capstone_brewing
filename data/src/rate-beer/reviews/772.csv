772,"2016-09-09",4.1,"En fût à la source em compagnie de Ju-Lo. Mon teku est rempli de ce liquide brun plutôt boueux aux allures lourdes et denses. Une tête cependant très floconeuse et légère est des plus encourageantes. Nez de pruneau, de fruits séchés, de sucre candi, de confiserie et de céréales. Jai peur pour la suite des choses. Je redoute un liquide de Noël franchement sucré et lourd au palais. Je goûte et à ma grande surprise, le liquide est dune déroutante légèreté. Sans être sèche, la bière ne présente aucune lourdeur et aucun sucre résiduel indésirable. Une note bien printanière de houblin européen se conjugue à une noisette ainsi quau pruneau préalablement ressenti. Moi qui ne connaît que très peu ce style, je suis maintenant très intéressé à en découvrir dautres, de ces bières à la souche Weizen qui ne goûtent aucunement la fameuse banane!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

Appearance : Hazy dark amber with nice lacings.

Aroma : Wheat and caramel with slightly roasted wheat notes. Nice bananas and hops.

Taste : Notes of wheat and light hops. Light caramel and bananas too. Finish has notes of wheat, bananas and other fruits. Rather dry.

Overall : Nothing outstanding but quite good. Nose better than taste. Im not particularly fond of Dunkelweizen so far (even though Ive only had 4). 110306 Fixed typos.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

Aroma of sweet grain and spice - sure, clove I guess, but mild;  dry.  Taste follows, almost wheaty, solid maltiness, with drying spice in the finish, hardly any alcohol to it.

Moderately hazy amber body with a creamy off-white head and awesome lacing.  Proper glassware is a plus.  Starts a little spicy and astringent.

Solid mouthfeel - creamy with enough fruit and adequate levels of tartness. Some elasticity in the mouthfeel due to the sugar level. Pretty solid.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"

772,"2006-11-01",3.2,"Very cloudy golden-red body with a medium off-white head.  Aroma is very fruity (mainly pineapples and strawberries) with plenty of coriander.  Taste is a mix bag of fruits (tropical fruits) and a bunch of spices (cinnamon, coriander, more).  Not much cereals or hops to speak of.  Rarely on the DDC menu this is a fun refreshing unconventional beer.  This pint was offered to me by the owner at the pub when we signed the papers that had me becoming a shareholder in the DDC bottling project.  If this projects crashes this beer shall be remembered as the most expensive pint ever rated on ratebeer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
772,"2005-11-29",3.2,"(Pint Draught) Pours a thin, white head with a reddish amber body. No carbonation. Quite the nose - bananas and wheaty. Like a weak Aventinus.

772,"2005-11-28",3.5,"Sand-blasted/tarnished copper, a fluffy and frail head that had lots of cling on my wide-mouth weizen glass, a credit to both the brewer and the dishwasher! 
The yeast profile had plenty of banana esters, that melded well with the grainy, wheaty aroma.
Velvetty smooth, with a bit more malt back backbone than your average weizen, the finish has that unripe banana tartness that I like, that ""green"", peely aftertaste coats your palate well and is quite long lasting, and makes this a pleasing and refreshing drink.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"
772,"2005-04-02",3.7,"Tap.  Hazy amber in colour, long lasting beige head.  Aroma was quite sweet, plums, prunes, bananas and soft bready malt.

772,"2005-03-11",3.7,"I all but forced tiggmtl and Muzzlehatch to go back to Dieu du Ciel just so that I could try another beer from them, hearing that this was just put on tap (actually we were under the impression the Hefe-weizen was on).  Truly a wonderful pour, with just a unique, stylish curvey-rounded weizen glass, nice, thick and heavy and just quite unpretentious and unadorned, but this isnt ratebeerglasses.com so enough about that.Dark amber color, tending more toward medium-auburn with some light orange and slight tints of magenta.  Just enough haziness to display the unfiltered nature, but not too much to give it a dull, muddy appearance.  Perfect amount of creamy, off-white head patiently sits atop the body as I drink the beer.  Aroma of sweet caramel, toasted grains, hops, banana chips and peach notes.  Not heavy on the clove/cinnamon at all, which is refreshing.  Its also interesting to be able to detect the hops this easily, which are fruity/floral and not too disruptive.  Flavor begins with lightly sweet caramel, and the body is slightly watery, but it dosent bother me, only adds to the drinkability.  Some light candied fruit notes, a bit of clean yeast and some light hops mixed with honey-buttered bread on the finish.  Creamy, medium-light body is fantastically drinkable.  Not terribly traditional, but who cares.  I get sick of too much clove in most dunkelweizens, anyways.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
772,"2005-03-08",3.7,"Chestnut brown cloudy body topped with a thick beige frothy head. Very nice yeasty aroma with citrusy, hoppy and spicy notes.

772,"2004-11-29",3.0,"Cloudy copper hue, 1cm off-white head doesnt last long. Brown sugar, apples, pears and grilled bananas up the nose. This smells very sweet and tastes very sweet. It tries to reach for balance with a mild acidity counterpart, but doesnt quite manage. A decent range of fruit flavors involved and a firm yeastiness in the weihenstephaner line, but as with any dunkelweizen Ive had, this lacks convergence and is heading nowhere. Mouthfeel is pretty nice nonetheless, soft and creamy..","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
