3656,"2017-02-15",4.1,"Sort Old Ale med fin mindre moccafarvet skumtop på 1-2 cm, som svinder til et par mm. Ufiltreret og rolig i glasset. 
""Sjov"" aroma af kældernoter og lidt mug. Desuden egetræ og senere klare whiskynoter. 
Smagen er præget af ristet malt og noter af whisky (Highland Park) samt egetræ. Vel afbalanceret med middel bitterhed og lille til middel sødme. 
Elegant blød mundfølelse qua en nedjusteret og veltilpasset karbonering. Konsistensen er olieret til cremet og kroppen er middel fyldig. Afslutningen er bitter og kort. 
Overall: Black Oil var tilfældigvis det tidligere navn til denne gode Scotch Ale, som er krævende, men forholdsvis drikkelig og tro mod de 8.0 %. Harvieston forstår sig på at lave denne slags øl, mærker man.

Közepes teste már a kitöltés során felfedezhető, illatai azonban masszívak, teltek, érettek; marcipános, likőrös, vaníliás single malt aromák, amikhez kissé éles váltással társul a későbbiek során a markánsabb, tőzeges lecsengés, de ne szaladjunk ennyire előre. A test, ahogyan arra számítottunk, enyhén szellős, közepesen szénsavas, mázsás súlytól mentes, vagy legalábbis a hordóban ázott ízjegyek lakhelyeként kissé szűkösnek tekinthető, mégis elegáns, könnyed, de teljes értékű. A csúcspont természetesen a Highland Park hordó által biztosított füstös vonalak, amelyek a levezetés fő irányát képviselik, az előzmények alapján némiképpen váratlanul, de korántsem rendszeridegen módon, a whisky ismeretének fényében legalábbis semmiképpen, csupán az alapok lehettek volna masszívabbak, hogy a struktúra némiképp vaskosabb lábakon álljon, s az efféle betetőzést megingathatatlanul viselje.

Ive always enjoyed my times with Engine Oil, and while I did enjoy this beer I thought it was lacking in a few things to give a better score. Aroma had some light acridness, wet dog, tobacco, wet dirt and very light whisky notes. Flavor was centered squarely on a worty, whiskyish flavor with notes of iodine, light boiled veggies, toffee and caramel also present. I did enjoy the fullness of the body of this beer, but it lacked any head formation and looked like a stout w/o carbonation. Coated my glass nicely.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

3656,"2013-11-28",3.7,"Its pitch black in color, but thin in appearance, with a weak head. The nose is more smoky than reminiscent of whiskey, with that dirty engine oil-like roast malt and peat aroma forming the basis of the nose. I think the Ola Dubh 12 year old smells a little more luscious. In the mouth its very meaty, like a barbecued sirloin doused with a healthy amount of black pepper. It is pretty thin in the mouth, with ghostly hints of sticky whisky sweetness and alcohol, but all packed in a relatively low alcohol beer. 

Its a little weak in potency, and with smoke character really wants me to bathe in more of it, but its a little too timid and its pretty frustrating. I love its character, but I want more of it.

Ola Dubh will initially be available in three different expressions; the initial release will be of small batches aged in casks formerly used to mature Highland Park 12 Year Old, Highland Park 16 Year Old and Highland Park 30 Year Old.

3656,"2013-05-11",4.6,"You look at this beer and try to discern a colour... the best you can get is that it is as black as sin and maybe shows some mahogany around the dimple and the rim of the glass.  The head upped and went after a very short time leaving a herbal-greenish tinge on a latte skim of bubble. The nose is just molasses all over. Im surprised this s connected with whisky and not dark rum. Black strap molasses, pumpernickel, rye, dark chocolate, treacle, plums and thick plastic dominate the aromas. While it is obviously enormous, it is a treat for the nose. Thick and oily in the mouth, those aroma signatures abound in the mouth with plentiful molasses. There is a nod toward bitterness but the start is its thick, oily texture. It is chewy and reminds me of an acquaintance who having been to Ireland (and was not known as a Guinness drinker) said you could stand a spoon up in the pints. This is probably as close as that gets. A bit of bonfire smoke starts to come out in the flavour, which is gratifying and resonates with the house character of Highland Park whisky - also a favourite.
This is love: beer and whisky in poetic harmony. Sweet toward the finish without being sickly and cloying. Plenty of lingering warmth in the top of the chest and a platoon of Orcadian distillery workers and Caledonian brewers to thank. The warmth in my chest is probably made up just as much of love.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"

I have a few caveats primarily related to dull carbonation but theyre relatively minor. The bottle is beautifully presented, playing off the traditions of the whisky industry. However, the beers appearance is a minor disappointment - black and oily indeed but the stunted head fizzled out faster than I wrote this sentence. The aroma is heavy on molasses, sweet with hints of oak and licorice. No obvious whisky notes yet. Almost flat in the mouth and certainly oily. Very sweet on the tongue - treacle pudding, licorice again, with some prickly hop cut-through and a hot finish. Richly flavoured but Im not yet convinced the barrel ageing has added much.

Retronasals beautiful, a little oaky and buttery, but again not really saying whisky to me. Which is nice, compared to some of the overdone whisky beers that taste as if the brewer just dumped a bottle of whisky into the vat (and mysteriously, the ABVs go up too, what a weird coincidence). Dry dry dry burntness, but still not ashy, very drinkable. Finish is soft and smooth, and still very burnt, but in such a mellow way. Superb mellow beer, every sip is delicious.

3.5 A: Dark brown, almost black color. Just half a finger of creamy light brown head. Retention isnt too great and no lacing left. Ill cut it some slack though for being well aged.

4.5 S: Massive nose on this. Whiskey is still quite potent. Smoke and roastiness compete for center stage, but ultimately the smoke wins out and adds a pleasant porcine component. Caramel, molasses, and notes of chocolate and toffee. Plum, raisin, and red apple fruitiness. Light peat.

4.0 T: Taste is like the nose. Big bacon smokiness. Roastiness to follow. Light peat. Caramel, molasses, and stronger-than-in-the-nose chocolate. Less whiskey than I was expecting, but still enough to complement. Plum and raisin fruitiness. The only thing Im not a fan of is the lack of sweetness. This has a lighter body and not a lot of malt to back up the other good flavors.

2.5 M: Between a light and medium body. Carbonation is low, but its fine for how old the bottle is. Not a lot of creaminess, which is mainly due to the light body. Give me some more body and this turns into a hell of a beer.

3.5 D: Very tasty with only the body causing complaints.

The first taste is strange, since, thanks to the beers black-as-night color, youre expecting something along the lines of a stout.  But Ola Dubh is a true old ale, tasting of glazed doughnuts and rich caramel.  Slowly gains a peat-infused center, before delving into the gloriously boozy depths of 16 year old Scotch.

Molasses with a good bbq smokiness arouse the palette. This is then followed by a gradual latter of delectable undertones like a good scotch, woody too.

Huge hits of scotch whiskey booziness along with subtle notes of chocolate, roasted malts, and smokiness. Mouthfeel isnt as thick as I thought itd be, but still very good. Any chance of tasting subtle, lingering flavors in the finish are pulverized by a strong whiskey heat. Overall, very interesting brew. Not mind-blowing or anything.

App.:  Deep brown-black with a nice light mocha head.

Palate:  Medium+body, smooth, sparse effervescence.

330cl bottle pours a deep dark light-defying black ale in the chalice. One finger tight frothy brown cap lasts well and laces.

Aroma on this one is not so endowed with a peat smoke tone, its there but a musty oak dried prune tone sits above it.

Ah yes, the peat tastes show up in the flavor, almost as pronounced as older oaked versions. A little lighter on the palate than older version but it has the same complexity with a slightly dryer hoppier finish. This is a good choice for those who cant afford to put many of the more expensive OD reserves (30 or 40 yr) in the cellar. It has the complexity of the more expensive versions with the oaky- peaty-smoky flavors less pronounced but very detectable.

3656,"2010-08-01",4.2,"Sitting before me in my chalice is a sight so beauteous I almost dont feel worthy. Blacks, browns, and fresh espresso settle under a tan head resembling rich velvet of the finest quality. Her crema head lingers as a respectably thick blanket of burnt bitter delights for the entirety of our session. But I am getting ahead of myself. First, let us divulge her nose which is more than enough to send my eyes rolling, toes curling, and soul moaning. Bakers chocolate, espresso crema, and pure black cacao nibs lead immediately into burnt chunks of wood black as earth. Toasted marshmallows, I like mine charred, are followed by licorice root, black strap molasses, and crunchy graham crackers. Smores dont have anything on this because my smores of yore were never dipped nor drenched in the fine delights of Highland Park 16yr scotch.

Mm A moment please.

Ok, Im back. Wood, vanilla bean extract, Hersheys syrup, and char ooze their scotch origins while heat tickles the back of my nose. Warm wood and scotch esters linger long after each snuff, and lead me right into a full medium-bodied quaff. Not as heavy as I was expecting, she nonetheless is silky smooth. Her loving attentions ensure there is nary a single space in my mouth that is not steeped in Old Engine Oil aged in Highland Park 16yr single-malt barrel delights. First to seduce are black strap, wood black as char, and a sticky finish which never diminishes. Lips quiver in delight from the molasses, caramel, and spice which coat them. Toasted marshmallow, graham cracker, burnt caramel, and espresso crema dance the night away while under the warm glow of scotch. Like a romantic evening, no part should be too extravagant, and so my Ola Dubh 16yr woos me with finesse and class. Im about halfway through my glass now, and she has reached optimum supping temperature which brings more warm spice to the finish. A river of melted chocolates lazes by underneath while scotch-soaked wood and nutmeg seep into my bones. Do not hurry whilst savoring the Ola Dubh 16yr. She demands your time, patience, and total attention. With each sup bringing the inevitable end closer, I marvel at how seamlessly she has blended together. Not quite as much scotch influence as I was expecting, but still fantabulous.


Price shmice. If you see any of the Ola Dubh bottles, buy em. You will not be sorry, and in fact, if you so wish you may write me to say Thank You. As an aside, they are pretty much already aged and ready to savor so in terms of cellaring, I would not. But then, it is still your choice. If you do decided to cellar, buy two bottles: one to savor fresh and one to age.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Strong roasted malt aroma with a decent amount of malt whiskey that doesnt overtake the other aromas. Dark chocolate, roasted coffee bean and roasted nut notes. Again, the aroma is dominated by a deep roasted maltiness but there is a good bit of oak and whiskey to balance things out.

Again the flavor is dominated by a deep roasted maltiness with lots of complexity and bitter dark chocolate flavor. However, they whiskey presence is much more prominent in the flavor than in the aroma. Lots of hot whiskey alcohol warmth but fortunately the other flavors still shine through. Not one-dimensional at all. Plenty of roasted coffee bean, burnt toast, hazelnut and dark chocolate notes.

On the contrary, it feels like its watering down. The carbonation also seems to affect the flavour if you allow the brew to sit too long. Thats kind of disappointing. As the brew passes bitter cocoa becomes more apparent with light notes of dark fruits. A nice sweet molasses counters the bitterness. Whiskey is somewhat evident and becomes a more defining flavour towards the finish. Alcohol also becomes more apparent towards the finish as well. The finish is lightly dry.

3656,"2009-03-31",4.3,"330 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. Bottle No. 61520. ABV is 8.0%. Pitch black colour, big to moderate and creamy tan head. The whisky oak cask with peaty smoke and notes of tar comes through  in the aroma, followed by notes of roastiness (roast malts, coffee) and chocolate. The aroma is more mellow and subdued than the 12 y.o., but still nice. The flavour has also here loads of rich malty sweetness, immediately followed by distinct notes of peaty smoke - it is again quite amazing what impact the whisky cask has. Dark chocolate in the middle. The finish has a firm bitterness from the hops and burnt malts, while the peaty smoke lasts through the long aftertaste. A truly impressive beer, but if you dont like scotch whisky at all, this might not be the beer for you.

How: Bottle 11.2oz.  Drank about 1 year after the beer release.  Side by side comparison of the Old Dubh 12, 16 and 30
The look: Black body topped by a very small tan head
In long: Nose has the similar elements of its little 12 year old sisters with peat, dirty wood, earth and date except everything is x 2.  Also a little smoky note that isnt there in the little sister.  Soft carbonation.  Taste of charcoal, burnt fresh wet wood, bakers chocolate, a whole lot of peat and also a lot of freshly cut green grass, some black liquorice and tobacco leaves.  Different but very cohesive.

The aroma was moderate toasted, chocolate and strong coffee malts; cola, salt, dark fruit, whiskey and light smoke. The initial flavor was lightly sweet; while the finish was moderately sweet and bitter with an average to long duration.

Surprise! It’s dark, which I didn’t expect. It’s pretty much pitch black in fact.

Iodine was the first thing that came through in the nose, something I pick up when I’m sampling a dram of Scotch. Funny, from memory, Highland Park didn’t smell like that. Enjoyable smoky and vanilla effluves as well.

Salty and acidic, it tasted like Tamari sauce, with a side of ashes. Light body, you can tell that the barrel aging stripped the Beer of some of it’s ’soul’, something I find a bit deplorable.

3656,"2008-07-03",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
Sublime peat smoke rises from the dark chocolate, vanilla and licorice dessert bestowed upon the ecstatic tastebuds in this rich, complex and highly original Old Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam lingers atop the pitch blackness.
-The salty component from the highly peated barrel alters the vanilla and chocolate aspect of the malt sweetness and takes it into sweet soy realms.
-The roastiness also takes the form of charred wood at times.
-There is barely any alcohol showing in this flavor profile.
-The smoky and roasty finish is bitter and enduring, but not too much as to bother the tastebuds.

Massive peat malt and smoke dominate the aroma. there is also some of that sea smell. at first, I could not detect the beer behind the overwhelming scotch. However, as it warmed, the beers malt was subtle with some light chocolate. The taste is the expected peat with a salty and lightly smoky finish. As it warms, the beer starts to shine a little past the whisky. There are notes of deep prunes and dark chocolate. A thick and oily mouthfeel complements the beer. i wanted to like this one more, but again, the barrel aging is just too much.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

I was very anxious to try this one because having had the 12, I knew this beer was good already, and by putting it in older scotch barrels, how could one go wrong?  Exactly.  This beer looks and smells and even tastes almost identical to the 12.  The difference is in the barrel, which really shines.  The 16 year old scotch barrel really adds a new level of scotch sharpness and peat that isnt present in the 12.  Very good stuff, and a really really cool concept.

3656,"2008-05-14",3.5,"Bottled September 2007; Sampled May 2008
A softly vigorous pour produces a two and a half finger thick, brown stained, tan colored head.  The beer is quite black in color and is opaque even when held up directly to the light.  The aroma is quite rich with concentrated notes of darkly caramelized malt, touches of teriyaki, iodine and a finish that smells of salt and light peat smoke.  Hints of fruit aromatics provide notes of burnt prunes and light raisin.  The smokiness really picks up after the first couple draughts of the aroma.  Rich malt aromatics combine with the peat character to contribute aromas of salty toffee, savory umami malt, .  This just has a hearty, quite satisfying aroma to it.  In fact the aroma is just expressively intoxicating and almost exactly what I am looking for in a nightcap; rich, savory, complex and deeply satisfying.

Somehow this beer tastes quite a bit cooler than I was expecting; mainly I think it is not quite as rich as I was expecting, and a thinner beer always feels cooler than a thicker beer at the same temperature.  The beer finishes with a deeply roasted, burnt espresso bitterness / astringency.  The beer is fairly sweet and accentuates a burnt raisin fruitiness.  This has a fairly light heft to it for a beer that smells this rich, though the viscosity is quite appropriate for a beer of this alcoholic strength.  The beer finishes with a touch of burnt vegetal character; burnt broccoli and burnt cabbage flavors lightly intrude on the finish.  As the beer warms up it picks up a bit more texture and richness in the flavor / mouthfeel, it still does not live up to the promise of the aroma though.  The roast character plays a huge role towards the finish; burnt malt, sharp espresso notes, slight charcoal and the aforementioned burnt vegetal note.

The aroma of this beer kicks some serious ass; I could smell this forever and continuously find myself just enjoying the aroma between extended sips of this beer.  The flavor, while it does not quite live up to the promise of the aroma, is still quite tasty in its own right, though it has some noticeable flaws.  A tasty brew, that just might age quite nicely over the next couple years, despite no being bottle conditioned.

Full bodied, but with soft carbonation and smooth oily texture. This goes through a roller coaster of flavors, starting with chocolate and subtle scotch, then moving to sweet notes of vanilla. Mid palate brings on accents of smoke, peat, and ash. The dry and peppery finish has some warming alcohol followed by lingering notes of charred wood. Very complex and well brewed, but just way to may smoke going on here for me. I was hoping for more scotch, but got more of the barrel. Fans of smoked beers should dig this.

At this point, I cant believe how much better this smells than the 12 year.  The first sip is nearly mind blowing, as the balance is damn near perfect, a stark contrast to the 12 year version, which was far more harsh.  Sweet and bitter dark chocolates lay the base, while soft peat and smooth whiskey add perfectly subtle compliments.  Theres a lactic creaminess that goes incredibly well with the dry smokiness.

Olives, leather, and dark chocolate and coffee in the aroma; vaguely clearer expression of dark chocolate and moss than the 12 year old.  Relaxed carbonation.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: this actually feels a little watery on the edges, like scotch on the rocks with the ice melted; some dark bakers chocolate and nougat, but also a bit ashy and dry and chalky.

3656,"2008-04-02",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2008 Intriguing.  Pours a dense black with minimal head (never an issue for me).  An intense aroma of chocolate and whiskey.  The flavor is smokey (but maybe more of an ashen smokey, in fact like a high end Scotch) and slightly boozy.  Its not as complex as I anticipated, but this is one of the few beers Ive had recently that made me think I need to try 2 or 3 more before I can really appreciate it.  Theres a pleasantly bitter (but not really hoppy aftertaste).  The key question:  is it worth the $9 I paid for an 11.2-ounce bottle.  I think, after Ive had a couple more, Ill say ""yes.""  Then comes the next question:  am I intrigued enough to try the 30 for $15 a bottle?  Not sure yet.  Stay tuned.","Hartland, Wisconsin, USA","Flyer"

3656,"2008-03-31",3.8,"Brandon, Fl - Kingdom Liquors - 11.2 oz bottle - #5629 - for these tracking. Pours a dark as night black with a thin mocha colored head. Strong aroma of smoked meats and salting fish - settles into something resembling fruity pebbles. Flavor of smoked meat comes through as well with some strong coffee notes. Earthiness comes through as well - rich black potting soil comes to mind. Just a tad too much saltiness though for my liking. Thick and rich mouthfeel. Nice novelty.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
3656,"2008-03-30",3.7,"Bottle.

Pour deep brown, almost black, very small head. Glorious aroma. A restrained, sophisticated sweetness of stone fruit and molassas leading; deep peaty, smoky whisky following. More and more of the smoke comes out in the aroma as I progress, to the point that its really quite heavy once Im half way through the beer. 

The flavor and mouthfeel disappoint somewhat. The former because I was expecting a little richer dried dark fruit, and instead the beer is pretty ashy, dry, even pushing salty (not so bad in and of itself, but very much not what I was expecting and hoping for, given the aroma). Its a bit harsh, a bit burnt, an unpleasant not-hops-but-something-else bitterness on the very long end. The latter because it comes off thin compared to what one expects from the aroma and appearance. Nonetheless, weve got an enjoyable and well crafted beer. Certainly interesting, certainly different, but not only for the sake of being interesting and different. It actually works pretty well. Not that this price point -- but thats another issue altogether and not one that Ive taken into account in the ratings. Given that I didnt drink this one head-to-head with the 12-year and given that its been a while since I had the latter, I cant really compare the two well beyond to note the similarities, suggest a slightly better integrated whisky-barrel character to the 16 (but this could be my imagination), and note that the 0.2 point difference between my ratings of the two is probably within the margin of error.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Poured dark brown approaching black, virtually no head.  Super light lacing.  Smells of roasted malts, chocolate, caramel, and toffee.<P>

On first taste, a pleasant complexity gives way to the whiskey overtones.  A dry but crisp bitterness follows.  Like its little brother OD12, OD16 is well under carbonated. <P>

As the OD16 warms the complexity strengthens and other flavors begin to make their way to the front of the class.  Maturing in those 16 year old whisky casks, OD16 does not hide its ABV very well.  Just the opposite, this beer tastes like a 10 to 12+%er.  It is only 8%<P>

Aroma is complex and rounded with everything working together.  Smooth, creamy chocolate, malted milk balls, and a whisky component that is not as intense when my nose is in the glass compared to when it was being poured.  Odd.  The whisky is well-integrated in the aroma - not overpowering or standing out, just a nice phenolic note buried within and a bit of alcohol at the end of a sniff.  Taste is rich, roasty, creamy, a tiny bit watery with a somewhat dry and smoky finish.  The whisky is evident but only when I search for it.  Seems to be one of the lighter-infused beers compared to some of its peers.  Ive had the regular version of this beer but dont remember it well enough to compare.
