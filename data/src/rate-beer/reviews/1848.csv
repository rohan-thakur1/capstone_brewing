1848,"2016-12-19",3.5,"(tap at the brewpub) Almost clear, pale golden colour with a blond and firm, mid-sized foamy head. Pale malty, slightly doughy aroma with notes of herbal and slightly grassy hops, accompanied by a tinge of honey and subtle fruity accents. Sweet-bitter flavour, medium bodied with a well-carbonated mouthfeel. Slightly biscuity and doughy pale malt character with shades of herbal hops in the background, getting stronger towards the sweet-bitter and quite balanced malty and hoppy finish. Good. 09.XI.12","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"
1848,"2014-11-21",4.1,"on tap at the brewpub, nice the way that on a sunday they start getting into full swing when drei kronen starts closing up. beautiful clear bright golden with a lasting shaving cream head; aroma of mulberry, white grape, passionfruit vine, honey; rich, buttery mouthfeel; decent hit of bitterness, weeds, peanut brittle. delicious - one of the rare bocks i could easily have a long session on","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
1848,"2014-10-28",2.0,"Vom Faß beim Höhn. - Tiefes Goldgelb, leicht trüb; rasch schwindender Schaum. - Geruch intensiv karamelmalzig, dumpf krautig-herb, fuselig. - Antrunk kräftig honigsüß (Waldhonig) mit Karamel und Haselnuß. Deutlich grün, mit butterigen Fehlaromen (Diacetyl). Durchschnittlich rezent, breit vollmundig. Im Abgang unaromatisch malzbitter mit unangenehm fuseligem Einschlag. Langer, dumpf-bitterer Nachtrunk mit ranzigen Nüssen, unangenehm fuseligem Einschlag und stark grünen Noten. - Stark karamellig aber nicht eigentlich süß, sondern unangenehm bitter und unreif. Mißratener Bock. Vielleicht auch nur noch nicht lang genug gelagert?","Beijing, CHINA","Moravius"

Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.

One of the best helles bocks Ive ever had.  Had to go back a second day to drink more I was so enamored with it.  Ridiculously deep, nuanced, clean, and balanced.  A masterwork.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1848,"2011-12-20",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2015 draft at the source.  lightly hazed bright gold with a fine white head. extremely soft and creamy texture, its decadently soft and nectar-like with impeccably balanced accompanying sweetness late.   alcohol noticeable but never excessive or unpleasant, and seems to work with the exceptional smoothness showcased up front and across the middle (and seems to impart a slight butane flavor). decadent, sticky, crisp, layered and sublime.  icky-sticky melanoidin bomb, rich and superbly clean.

Tried again in November 2014 and it was superb!  (No diacetyl)","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1848,"2011-12-18",4.4,"Draught at Brauerei-Gasthof Höhn: Luminous blonde with a light haze. Persistent creamy fragmented foam. Divine aroma dripping with honeysuckle Hallertauer nectar, lemon cake, cracker dough, baking bread and a magically bright ripe peach and creamed banana medley. Some fervid hop spice in there, as well. Dense and creamy carbonation. First sip is absolutely awash in sweet mouth-filling  hop oils. Apparent yet perfectly subdued peach esters join in on the resoundingly bright symphony. Malt soon emerges with deep-rooted melanoidins that hug the palate with a fluffy caress. Fermentation is evidently clean as a whistle, though somehow the malt seems to pack a deeply satiating weightiness. Not even a trace of yeast to be found. Alcohol provides some scratch and a noticeable warmth, but is clean as can be and subsequently releases ample peppery hop zip. Late flourish of dryness counters the luscious honey-drenched malt only to reveal more melanoidin grip along with fresh bread,  cracker and a perceptible mineralic twinge buried within the ensuing  eruption of tongue-lapping oils. The esters, while appropriately secondary and lustrously polished, are curiously succulent to the point of taking on a tropical fruit quality which boosts the quaffable nature with an explosive and profoundly invigorating splash of acid. Remarkably balanced finish is ever so tastefully nuanced with light vanilla cake - frosting and all - and a boundless 3-minute afterglow of floral hop juiciness capped with vibrant peach. An extraordinarily quaffable, peerlessly clean rendition, with strong emphasis on hop flavor and bright estery delicacies. And the malt is utterly resplendent. A shining example of how to weave subtlety with complexity.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1848,"2011-02-10",3.5,"Draft. Milky yellow, pale and cloudy with a frothy head. Aroma is farmy, pedio, and yeasty but overall ok. Fizzy palate. The flavors have a lot of strength. Pale wood taste, and a dry finish.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
1848,"2011-02-06",4.2,"Hazy blond.  Thick head.  Big bready pale malt aroma promises a full-bodied beer.  Brash malty character, full malts, some yeasty rusticity, light spicy fruits.  The finish is dry and spicy.  Yum.  One of the top bocks of the season.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
