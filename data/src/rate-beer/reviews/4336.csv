4336,"2014-12-25",3.9,"Putting this brew out alongside their legendary Spruce Ale must be tough. While still a solid brew in its own right, it cant hold a Christmas candle to the might Christmas-In-A-Cup of the aforementioned tree-flavoured powerhouse. This handsome ol dark ruby copper brew doesnt have much in the way of smell, some burnt toffee, molasses, leather and wood, present but not strongly pronounced. The taste is stronger, a mostly sweet burst of the smell with hints of well balanced spice. A smooth bitterness creeps up carefully on the back end, not disturbing but enhancing the velvety smooth malt backbone. A fine, rich full-bodied quaff thats best enjoyed a bit on the warmer side.","Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, CANADA","BrewGoblin"

The taste follows, slightly sharp, spicier and grainier, solid and not all that boozy.  Thick body, soft carbonation, malty finish but dry from all the spice - liked it, had it again a year later and liked it the same.

Flavour is sweet malts up front, a bit of fruitiness, some chocolate, bit of yeasty funk comes up mid-palate and then moderately bitter hops dry down the beer quickly on the finish.

4336,"2012-02-29",4.1,"Bottle: Decants a turbid clouded brown colored ale with a 1 finger sticky cap. Soft carbonation obviously unfiltered. Aroma is a complex affair with spice up front and cocoa, earthiness, grains and some mellow ripe fruit esters and a treacle-like touch of sweetness....this intensifies as it warms. Flavor follows aroma with malty cocoa mixing with musty fruits spice and hazel nuts - complexity mid palate - hops add a wonderful support role and hang in the background so the complexity can be savoured. Finish is long wet and malty-yeasty with a small hop bite at the very end.
 I love this brew! The brewer resisted their normal impulse to over boil hops and the result is the profile on this ale is carried by the complex flavours that develop in a rich unfiltered big ale. Im impressed. Probably this brewers best effort yet.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

I tried this beer on February 2, 2012 after purchasing from the Garrison Feature at the Queens Quay LCBO outlet in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The beer poured a translucent coppery red colour with a bubbly tan head.  The aroma was nutmeg, caramel, sweet malt and weak floral hops.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation.

Flavour hits with sweet malts and cinnamon upfront, met with dry cardamom and rounded out well with some orange rind. Feels lightish on the palate, and not a whole lot of booze which I guess is good. I always hope that these beers will be kind of bock-like, but it rarely happens and this is no exception. A good beer, but not the kind of stand-out that the Spruce Beer is. Good seasonal brew though.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

4336,"2011-02-10",3.4,"500 ml bottle in the Brewmasters Mix from LCBO private imports, served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass. 
App.:  Clear deep mahogany with a decent tan head.
  
Aroma:  As expected, some warm spices enveloped in lovely, sweet, thick malts, a Christmas cake in a bottle, some bright fruitiness mixed with dark dried fruits, a little alcohol, ginger, cinnamon and clove, hints of playful esters, caramel and cake batter, well-crafted for the style.
  
Palate:  Medium+ body, lush, elegant effervescence.
  
Flav.:  A bit more malt than the nose, plenty of warm, Christmas cake spices, decent fruitiness, caramel and brown sugar, a little alcohol, still a liquid Christmas cake; kinda sweet with balancing acidity and bitterness and a malty, spiced finish.

As these beers go, not bad.  It struck me while drinking this: why is it called an ESA, while other, similar brews are S/H/V.  Food (or drink) for thought...","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"

4336,"2010-12-15",4.4,"500ml bottle poured into a nonic glass...

The beer has a nice cloudy deep copper body, with a good healthy light caramel head. The head retention is pretty good.

The smell is very malty and fruity (cherries, plum, figs). A fair amount of hops is also present in the aroma. The yeast comes through in the smell just a little.

The taste starts out with a surprising hop bite, with herbal and citrusy notes, after which the malts take over, bringing a nice, moderately sweet, bread and caramel taste, mildly garnished with cinnamon. There is also a solid fruity profile, with hints of plum, cherry, apple, and grapefruit. The finish is very bready and quite bitter, with a lingering grapefruit and cherry taste.

Medium-bodied and rather chewy. Moderate carbonation enhances the mouthfeel. The beer feels slightly spicy, with just a hint of alcohol. Goes down smooth, kindly providing a pleasant warming sensation that a lot of us crave throughout the winter season.

The drinkability is good, considering this is a strong and full-bodied beer. Goes down smooth. The alcohol does not get in the way.

Overall, this is an impressive beer and a very complex winter warmer. It is everything it claims to be and it does it well! Recommended!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","DenisLD"

Theres a lot of cheap brown sugar in there too and things that remind me of tooth paste. Faint hints of something that might be beer underneath, but its hard to be sure. The cinnamon and clove really come out strong on the palate with a slightly bitter finish thats full of brown sugar but not overly sweet.

4336,"2009-12-12",3.1,"My Bottom Line:
This Winter Warmers well-levelled spiciness focuses on cloves and cinnamon before delving in a soft earthy finish accented by leafy hop bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the cloudy ruby brown.
-Effervescence is soft and drinkability quite high due to the well dried out finish.
-Fruit cake allusions roam within.
-This might be a fun winter brew, but on the world stage it doesnt stand out much.

Full, creamy mouthfeel. Flavour is sweet (brown sugar & caramel) and spicey, with a pleasant nuttiness and a moderately bitter finish. A really nice warmer, very enjoyable.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
4336,"2009-02-18",3.5,"2009-02-05. Ruby brown body with a nice creamy tan head. (3+)  Mild aroma, spice, nutmeg? Light fruit, ephemeral notes of bubblegum. (7+) Sweet up front, malt, light fruit, spice, and more of what I attribute to nutmeg. Spice has a light bitterness to it in the finish. (7+) Smooth average to medium palate. Nice overall but seems to be slowing with age. Bottle from the brewery in November","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

4336,"2009-01-05",3.6,"500mL bottle shared by JoeMcPhee, poured into a copita glass. Color is chestnut brown.  Aroma is British wet malts, light musky and very ESB-like. Taste is similar, I do not get any kind of spiced character but a wet and dark cold night kind of feel from it. Otherwise, average carbonation and medium mouthfeel.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
4336,"2009-01-01",3.6,"Deep orange-amber beer with a creamy off-white head.  Aroma is full of deep sweet malts, orange peel hoppiness and a soft yeast estery character.  Spicy and fruity yeastiness with a lightly herbal flavour  Sweet fruity flavour, soft palate with a nice yeasty spiciness.  There is a bit of sweet nuttiness behind the malts.  This comes across as more like an English strong than S/H/V, but it’s a pretty nice brew whatever you call it.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
