2439,"2016-07-16",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 16, 2016 Poured from a 375 ml bottle, vintage 2012. Thanks Tom10101! Aroma is apples, rich caramel, some faint toffee. Light spice notes with hints of stone fruit. Light tannins. Pours a golden color with no head. Sheets of alcohol and long legs with no lacing. Flavor is very sweet with nice red apple notes and hints of green apples and light tannins. Moderate spice notes with lighter hints of tropical fruit and touches of citrus. Light alcohol notes adding a bit of spice as well. More green apple notes in the finish with some caramel. Mouthfeel is full bodied with no carbonation. No astringency or alcohol warmth. Overall, a nice ice cider. It?s hard to compare after a night of beer, but this one seems really good. Nice caramel note with a lot of apple complexity. Hints of other fruits with a decent spice note.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

2439,"2015-05-31",4.4,"2 oz sample from bottle (375 ml). Vintage 2012.

Appearance: Clear pale bright golden with some alcohol legs. 

Aroma: Bright tropical fruits notes along yellow pears brings a nice ""freshness"" impression. Theres some apples of course, but they play a second role here. Almost no alcohol on the nose and very mild spiciness. 

Taste: Medium sweetness (for the style) along a bright acidity that helps the balance. Tropical fruits galore (pineapples, mangoes, papaya) along yellow pears, freshly picked apple. Almost no presence of alcohol, brown sugar or spices that you often get in ice ciders... this one is all about fruits and freshness. 

Palate: Medium body. Oily mouthfeel. Not as thick as most ice ciders. Fruity and tropical finish. First time the alcohol is noticeable is in the finish where you get just a tiny little warming presence. 

Overall: Bright and fresh tropical fruits forward ice cider with a nice balance between sweetness and acidity (leaning a bit more toward acidity) and a nice level of complexity. Better than the cryoextracted ice cider from the same cidery and vintage (which is also very good). Unique. A stellar ice cider. I will definitely stockpile a few of them while they are still available.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2439,"2015-02-19",3.6,"Bottle @ Mondial des Cidres de Glace 2015. Light golden pour, a little thinner than usual it would seem. Very sugar forward and sweet.
