883,"2014-06-08",3.1,"Bottle at Craigs. Pours cloudy brown. Im not really a big fan of sake. Thought this has a touch of umeboshi about it. Rice wine.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","allmyvinyl"

883,"2013-04-22",3.8,"Copper colour. Medium aroma of peach, green apples and some herbs maybe. One of my problems with sake is that I think the flavour tend to be way too short, onsly lasting for a second or two, but this one has a much more lasting flavour then the other sakes Ive tried. Flavour is a good balance beetween peach, green apples and some vanilla. A little alcohol stinch in the finish, not too much though. Good palate. Overall the best sake Ive tried so far, though Im not that experienced on the subject.","Kverneland, NORWAY","Bathory"

883,"2011-03-02",2.8,"Little aroma. Hazy with the color of dried blood. Tangy and astringent, meaty and savory. The red rice gives character to this daiginjo. Enjoyable and unique.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"

883,"2010-02-15",3.7,"I have about zero experience with sake, but I really liked this. Clear purple pour is attractive.  Nose is great marshmellow and a lavendar blossom rose note.  Surprisingly no alc heat.  Id drink this all day.  Thanks maniac","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Butters"

883,"2009-09-12",3.2,"Purple?  Strong, almost rough rice aroma.  Some rubbing alcohol as well.  Not pleasant.  Initial, very short lived shock of sour, then suddenly goes into a much better flavor of rice.  Some fruitiness as well, almost like apricot.  Rather enjoyable to me.  Much better than the aroma.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
883,"2009-07-31",3.2,"Tried a sample of this at the Aleksey Spirits tasting in Nashville.  Got some wood/smoke and malt in the aroma and flavor.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","Barrios"
883,"2009-03-08",3.2,"180 mL bottle from Vintage Cellar in Blacksburg, VA. Pours a copperish color. Aroma of caramelized sugar, milk and alcohol. Very strong taste of melon, rice, alcohol, cotton candy, caramel. Full bodied and a bit harsh. Very interesting.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
883,"2008-02-13",3.1,"Dark golden to brandy color, perhaps a hint of peach or pink. Not much as far a legs go. Gooseberry, sherry, dark honey and light alcohol scents. Very sweet as far a sakes go. Light berries, lightly caramelized sugar and touch of paint thinner in the flavors. Not as clean as many others and a touch too sweet for me.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
883,"2008-02-01",1.8,"This bottled sake from a bottle shop poured a head of finely sized clear colored bubbles that were fully diminished and left behind a uncarbonated brown purple hued body. The aroma was woody and kind of weird for a sake. The mild flavor contained notes of vinous. A horrible one that I would not buy again.  Ugh I really didnt like this one.  A Drain Pour.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
883,"2008-01-23",4.3,"crisp red color on this still body.  DHay and rice on the aroma.  Sweet honey and hay body.  Well hidden alcohol.  Smooth finish with a hint of soymilk.   From a flight at the UMI Sake house.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
883,"2008-01-09",3.9,"The pour yields a crystal clear, pinkish, pale orange body that is reminiscent of a Rose wine.  A quick swirl coats the glass with thick, droopy legs, foreshadowing a substantial, viscous body.  The aroma is sweet and earthy.  Light smoke shrouds scents of koji, sweet berries, and a myriad of exotic flowers.  The flavor is simultaneously sweet and lightly tart from the various fresh berries that are the essence of this drink.  Koji and smoked rice add contrasting, yet complimentary earthy components.  Very complex and interesting.  A substantial, lightly syrupy mouthfeel is quite viscous on the tongue.  Id prefer just a touch more dryness to the palate, but this is quite good nonetheless.  Ive sampled many infused sakes that dont incorporate fruity components as well as this pure Daiginjo.  Excellent stuff from a great sake producer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
883,"2007-09-14",3.7,"6 oz bottle from mgumby10; Sake style #10; smoky, sugary, rice nose; translucent crystal, raspberry color; flavor has a pasty sweetness with some nuttiness added. Diffenent than the others I have had. Cant wait to try the other daiginjo I have.","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
883,"2007-07-09",4.2,"Pours to a glowing red-orange wood colored body with no head and and nice long clear legs.  The aroma is mesquite smoked rice and delicate floral components hiding below the smoke.  The flavor is also a mesquite smoked rice with notes of hickory and finishes with a delicate floral rice and fruits.  The palate is sweet and fruit juicy.  Mouth watering but not dry.  Nice light acidity on the tip of my tongue.  Very nice.  No alcohol whatsoever.  Smooth.  As I experience this sake, the longer I drink it, the more I notice some sort of bing cherries and plums.  This was a marvelous sake.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
883,"2007-05-30",3.7,"Some berries on the nose, hints of citrus.  Pours clear red, or pinkish?  Smoooth fruit, citrus and berries, notes of strawberry, raspberry, with passion fruit, yeast, and a tartness, all covered with a bready flavor.  Very different, i see the resemblance with a Red Rice Ale.","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
883,"2007-02-02",3.4,"Light peach pour.  Sourdough bread, and funked out fruits.  taste is pretty darn smooth. Almost tastes like a flat beer.  Pretty doughy, with some light citrus, and some very light smoke in the finish.  I have not had too many sakis and this is my first saki rating but I thought this one was pretty good.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
883,"2005-12-13",2.8,"Smoky, sourdough, almost meaty salami, earthy and alcoholic aroma.  Clear peach-pink coloured body is very viscous and coats the sides of the glass.  Very floral and smoky, spicy flavour with underlying meatiness and a lasting sweet aftertaste.  Alcohol not apparent on the tongue.  Some doughy, rice pudding characteristics.  Light body wit fairly strong alcohol warming.  While not my favourite sake, it is interesting to have given it a try.  Bottle from RBSG 2005.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
883,"2005-11-06",3.6,"[At RBSG 2005] This is my first sake rating, so I have no reference. The sake is peach colored with no head. The aroma is flowery with notes of rosehips and nuts. The flavor has a touch of coconut besides the flowery notes. Thanks to Büch Dich for bringing my first sake rating.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
883,"2005-08-03",3.8,"Clear, light peachy pink. Aroma is fruity (reminiscent of melon) & candy-ish w/ notes of popcorn & almonds. Smooth feel. Flavour is sweet w/ some earthiness & a mild acidity. Finish leave a warming alcohol burn.","Waterdown, Ontario, CANADA","joeycapps"
883,"2005-07-22",3.8,"Bottle sampled @ RBSG 05 (Montréal) Grand TastingSunset beige, peach almost, nose of light melon, sour dough bread, popcorn and light koji. The flavor has light alcohol, lightly sweet with some more koji than I usually like. Interesting sake, much more earthy than I had thought it would be.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
883,"2005-07-11",3.6,"My first Sake rating, so bear with me, sampled at the RBSG 05 bottle tasting, courtesy of Bück Dich: Pours a still, clear pale, faint peach color. Aroma is dry, earthy, ricey, and floral.  Body is smooth, yet full, with a pleasant light sweetness and good flavor, but with a slight burn in the finish.  A very interesting and complex concoction, but could hide the alcohol a little better.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
883,"2004-11-19",4.3,"720ml bottle. No head (still). Body is clear light pink. Aroma is notes of pie crust, flowers, watermelon, rice, raspberry. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is light sweet, lightly acidic. Light to medium body, watery texture, flat carbonation.  The most attractive aroma Ive come across in the sake world yet.  No glue smell, and the typical raw rice smell is in the background.  Extraordinary nose, stunning peachy color, quiet alcohol, wonderfully balanced, rich mouthfeel for sake, very clean.  This is easily my favorite sake to date.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
883,"2004-08-15",3.8,"I am not experienced in rating this style as I just started drinking them.  The pour is a light amberish orange, very clean and clear.  The flavor is rich, sweet and acidic with some mineral flavor in the aftertaste.  Unusual, but very very good.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","harlequinn"
