2730,"2017-05-12",3.4,"Bottle. Sour lemon/milk, biscuit malt, and lemon peel/grass aroma. Hazy yellow with nice white head. Moderately sweet passion fruit/pineapple/orange, biscuit malt, and mildly bitter lemon peel/grass flavor. Okay body.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
2730,"2017-04-27",2.8,"Crisp, and ever so slightly hazy golden coloured body with a thinnish, single centimetre tall pure white head and a few bubbles rising from the bottom. Aroma of grass, cream, alcohol, sugars, cardboard and a very sweet, syrupy and citrus scent. Light-bodied; Mellow and herbal flavours at first with a big dose of bread and yeast along with some lighter malts and a touch of apples and pear sweetness. Aftertaste shows some very mellow hop notes, a bit of the grain and cardboard maltiness and a finish of sweetness from fruit with no hops at all. Overall, a decent beer, with no real perceived dry hopping, except some grassy hop notes, but they seem more intense and probably during the boil. I sampled this twelve ounce bottle purchased from Meijer in Woodhaven, Michigan on 08-December-2016 for US$16,99 for the mixed twelve pack, sampled at home in Washington on 26-April-2017.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

2730,"2016-09-02",4.0,"12 ounce bottle into lager glass, bottled on 7/11/2016. Pours slightly hazy gol,den straw color with a 1 finger dense and rocky white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange peel, pineapple, peach, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/pine hops and light-moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/citrus peel bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, light pepper, pine, cracker, bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Very nice complexity, robustness and balance of citrus/pine hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero astringent hop flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors, with zero yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, crisp, dry, and lightly grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.2%. Overall this is a great pale lager! All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink. I would guess Chinook or Columbus on the hop variety. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
