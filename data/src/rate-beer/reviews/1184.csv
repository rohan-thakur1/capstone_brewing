1184,"2017-06-06",4.0,"33cl bottle in snifter. STRAIGHT FROM CALI (La Jolla) in the luggage, BIG THANKS TO BOB AS ALWAYS !! 
Pours a moderate, but dense, 1-2 fingers head, off white appearance; deep golden to orange color, with some light haziness. Smells really fresh and nice from the beginning: mango, pine, lime, all mixed on a minty background. Taste orange peel, tropical ripe, earthy, rich malts, resin, typical west coast. Really quite sustained but at the end pleasing bitterness, medium sweetness + that also kicks in. Very nice on the nose, with a bold and complex taste profile, maybe not as sophisticated as other indians from alesmith but still very solid.","ITALY","brianza_ale"

I dont like it. There is a bit of citrus and some hop present, but the malts really are pissing me off. Its not that great. The flavor is a little better, but not much. Malty as hell. The citrus and juiciness makes it a little more tolerable. Its just a disappointment all around. The mouth feel is interesting. Its thicker and carries a nice carbonation but has a lingeringly malty and light citrus aftertaste. Interesting, but not my jam at all.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

1184,"2016-06-16",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 19, 2016 What a treat this is. 
Solid gold pour, gleaming like the Olympic medal it so richly deserves.  
Nose explodes with tons of floral perfume and pine resin. After a swirl, defined pineapple, mango, red apple, tea, lemon curd, young stonefruit. Nothing too ripe about this one except some juicy peachy/apple notes.  
The sip starts of coniferous and sweetly floral, easing down to under-ripe tropical fruit, beautifully austere bitterness, a paper-thin coating of delicate caramel malt. A nearly bone-dry finish, with the exception of pine resin, green banana peel, and white flower lingering along the tongue.   I enjoyed this before two great (and familiar) brews (3 Floyds Gumballhead and Space Station), and this brew was a renewal to my palate. ""Juicy"" is no adjective applicable to this beer; it is resinous, perfume-blasted, youthfully tropical, and BITTER.   This is a hopheads fantasy.

Heavy light body with a fairly smooth texture. Superbly carbonated with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a rollicking fine effervescent prickly finish.

The outstanding flavor profile is almost world class. It begins with the citric flavors of the nose, but with more grapefruit rind present. The rind flows into spruce in the middle over a rising malt influence. A mild bitterness kicks in and the malts assume the forefront with a rich grainy biscuit sweetness. Surprisingly, caramel notes are present at a much higher level than the color would suggest. The finish delivers the expected alcohol burn at the back of the throat, but also allows the alcohol content to escape its previous flavor masking.

1184,"2014-08-04",2.5,"Bottle.

Head is initially large, frothy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is dark yellow to light amber.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly to moderately hoppy (resin, grapefruit), with notes of cardboard and alcohol.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately to heavily bitter.

Medium to full body, watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic, moderately astringent.

Alesmith has long had issues with premature oxidation, and this is a good, recent example of that...this only hit shelves in the last month or two, but is already noticeably papery. There are still some hops apparent, but not much, and they are the basic resinous-grapefruity variety. Theres really not much else going on here. Abrasive and caustic in the mouth...astringent and unbalanced. A below average example of the style by anyones measure.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Lots of citrus flavours, earthy and a little peppery at the end. Spices go well there with the dry and firmly bitter finish.

1184,"2014-07-17",3.8,"My recommendation is to try this a couple times... In various social settings. Perhaps its the name and a self fulfilling prophecy, but the beer takes on the ""holiday"" you enjoy it in. Whether its a holiday in the summer with neighbors and side walk chalk or an obscure bicentennial celebrating the birth of unicycles, the enjoyment factor directly hinges on your commitment to the festivities. First time trying it... I was invested with great friends and a monumental night. Second time... Same great friends and a great time... But the beer lost its superiority.

Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange zest, pineapple, floral, pine, grass, bread, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of hop notes with a moderate malt balance; and good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, tangerine, pineapple, orange zest, floral, grass, pine, bread, light caramel, and floral earthiness. Fair amount of earthy pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of citrus, citrus zest, pineapple, floral, grass, pine, bread, light caramel, and floral earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible balance and complexity of hop flavors; with a moderate malt balance behind the hops and zero cloying bitterness after the finish. Hop flavors are extremely smooth and non-astringent here. Medium carbonation and body; with a lightly creamy, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming noticed after the finish. Overall this is an incredible DIPA style! Big complexity of citrus hop flavors with a moderate malt balance; and extremely smooth and crisp to sip on. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

M: Tons of alcohol and very dry. Stinging and resinous.

A: Pours a very hazy gold/straw color with a big fluffy head. Retention is perfect! Gorgeous pour, and the head is similar to Alesmiths IPA, which basically looks like meringue

T: Huge bitterness upfront that is balanced by a nice honey-like sweetness. Yeast is unique, and quite flavorful. Citrus, tropical fruit hops are here also.

1184,"2012-02-27",3.9,"From notes.  First reviewed 8/23/2010.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. 

My pour out of the bottle has a hazy tangerine / orange color with a slight tinge of pink. A monster white head forms upon pouring. Great retention, and lace sticks all over this glass.

A light sweetness in the aroma, but I enjoy the strong hop profile. Mostly fruity grapefruit and tangerine, with a hint of floral notes as well.

The taste starts with a light, slightly sweet malt presence, but it not close to balanced. The pale malt contributes more to the general sweetness than anything. Strong and slightly varied hops provide most of the muscle. Juicy grapefruit, pineapple, and a bit of tangerine bitterness are the true focus. Finishes a bit bitter, with a hint of alcohol. 

The high level of carbonation leads to such a soft feel the beer sits upon the tongue like a pillow, with active bubbles creating a vibrating sensation as well. Light hop oil residue remains after each sip. Fuller than medium bodied, but it retains a light feel.

My personal preference is for a DIPA that wraps up clean, but the light amount of malt presence here really allows the hops to shine through. A solid brew that holds its own in a style full of great beers.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Taste has a omewhat faded hop profile, theres the remnants of grapefruit, citrus, and pine. Its definitely a shell what I imagine it was fresh. Theres a little astringency/bitterness on the backend and just a little bit of alcohol (taste and warmth) in the finish. Sizable malt base with a good bit of caramel sweetness.

Aroma is pine, citrus and some woodiness.  Taste is citrus pine, with some thickness, finishing quite bitter and long.  Good flavor.  Looking for this for a long time, and it was very nice - missing the fruit flavors up front that make Dreadnaught and Double Jack exceptional in my opinion.  ck1 says somewhere between Dread and Ruination is summer Yulesmith.

This is the firework one (the photo should be changed on this website to clear up any additional confusion). Received as an extra in a trade with stawn. Thanks. Beer poured into a snifter.

Beer is orangish to yellow and has a slight haze to tit. Forms a two fingered white head of small to medium bubbles. Head completely coats the sides of the glass with lacing. Carbonation is moderate and steady. Feeds the head well.

Im sitting about a foot from the beer and I can smell it from here. Big hop aroma, a slight yeast funk, the yeast did not completely settle out of the beer and when I popped it they floated back up into the beer. Oh well. There is some malt sweetness in this beer as well. Very strong, citrus hop aroma.

Beer is medium bodied and has a good hop flavor in the mid-palate, definitely citrus hops. The bitterness is not bad. This beer is less malty than many DIPAs Ive been trying lately and this is good. Drinkability is really high. Beer is not overly sweet. I fear that the hops may have diminished in this beer, I should try and get one of these more fresh than this but there still is significant bitterness. The reason why I think it may have faded is there is a slight sulfur aftertaste to this beer that I attribute to fallen hops. Overall its a great beer and this sulfur flavor is mild and not distracting. There is basically no aftertaste but the bitterness does grow the more you drink. I think the body and feel of this IPA a lot.

1184,"2011-01-26",4.0,"Poured into a snifter. Big thanks to piclee and psiweaver for this.

4.5 A: Hazy yellow orange color. Three fingers of creamy/frothy hybrid with excellent retention and plenty of lacing.

4.5 S: Piney, floral, and citrusy. At first it has an uncomfortable resemblance to Pine-Sol, but then an underlying layer of bitterness brings it back to the realm of beer. Pine and orange are the strongest aromas, with lemon zest and pineapple following. Really nice. I wish I could give it a 4.75.

4.5 T: Orange and pineapple are beating my tongue senseless. Tropical fruits, pine, grapefruit, and herbalness underneath. Lots of flavor hops, in fact maybe the most flavor hops Ive encountered, but theres an annoying bready/doughiness getting in the way. I usually like a barleywine-esque DIPA, but in this case the hops are the star and the malts are just distracting. Still, this is a very tasty brew.

4.0 M: Thicker medium body. Again, the malts are pissing me off. This falls into the middle ground between dry, bitter DIPAs and barleywine DIPAs. If this picked a side, Id be happier. Still, good creaminess and smooth.

4.5 D: This is a great brew. If the malts were a bit cleaner, this would be a 5 for sure. AleSmith knows there shit, I learned that a while ago.

1184,"2010-12-13",4.3,"This is an odd one for me. Firstly I was blown away to get my hands on this, though I seem to have slightly bad luck with Alesmith beers. Firstly with a bottle of Yulesmith Winter which I thought was going to be the summer and turned out to be a bottle that was about 2 years old,the beer was still pretty good, but hop-wise I think it had passed its best. Here I open the Summer Yule and am greeted by ridiculous carbonation, an out of control head that you would expect to see from an over conditioned Belgian, or an Alvinne beer with a very yeasty almost metallic aroma. I decid not to cry and leave the beer to one side for 15 mins and sure enough the carbonation had calmed down alot leaving a glowing golden pint with a massive white head. Aroma had pulled itself together somewhat to with loads more tropical notes than expected, very fruity, pineapple, mango, blood orange, citrus peel, spice, but still a bit more yeast and a slight metallic tinge right at the end. Behind that there are caramel and honey notes with butter and creamy malt. Flavour starts with a nice vanilla like entry, then into runny honey, spice and then a nice emerging citrus bitterness from the hops with more blood orange, pink grapefruit and sweet resin. Really has a lot of honey running through it. Finish comes about with more floral notes, a touch of perfume ad a wonderful dryness that is quite palate coating after a while. Very well balanced brew with perhaps the best alcohol control Ive encountered in this style. This really could be a hearty IPA rather than a DIPA, the balance seems to have been handled very, very well. I dont know whether my bottle was a bit of an unlucky odd one as far as the conditioning was concerned, I suspect that it has been a bit of an odd one out, but I can still see many great things in this beer, and refuse to downgrade it due to bad luck. Still not as good as Green Flashs IIPA, but like I say under the circumstances its hard to say for sure. Very drinkable, and without a doubt it is the most refreshing DIPA Ive ever had.","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"

1184,"2010-08-10",3.8,"Bottle from wavers1, thanks a lot! Pours a clear, golden orange with loads of bubbles rising to the massive fluffy white head. The aroma isnt too subdued by the thick layer of suds. It is very floral, citrusy, a little bit of alcohol in there, which comes off as a bit raw. Some sweet, juicy fruitiness in there, tropical fruits. I have a bit of a hard time pinning down the sweetness in here. Fruity, but perhaps a bit candy-like too, or wine gum. The sip is pretty much like you would expect at this point. Short fruity sweetness before massive citric and floral hops cleanse the palate. Bittersweet semidry finish with a moderate alcohol sting and warmth. Body is medium to light, carbonation is pretty mellow and smooth. Overall, its a good drink. I would prefer the alcohol to be hidden a bit more, and maybe its not completely fresh anymore, but i found their regular IPA to be better by a big margin.","Årnes, NORWAY","Kestral"

Appearance:This beer has a pale golden color, with a nice thick head of white foam.

Taste:This beer is quite an eye opener at the first taste, because of the huge hoppy flavors. Once I can get past the pure bitterness, the grapefruit and pine flavor of the hops starts to come through. There is a fair amount of sweetness that tries to balance the hops, but falls short. The sheer amount of alcohol in this beer is more noticeable in the aftertaste than in the foretaste. Also on the aftertaste, once the bitterness recedes, the peach flavor lingers pleasantly.

Appearance: Honey orange colored and lighter around the edges. Nice 2-3 fingers of foam with lots of retention and lacing.

Smell: Lots of caramel malt sweetness, a boat load of hops, and a touch of alcohol.

Taste: exactly like the nose.

Mouthfeel: a touch syrupy and medium to medium full in body. The carbonation doesnt come through enough IMHO.

Drinkability: Good for the style but a touch too thick in body and under carbonated for me to keep kicking these back.

Not a bad brew at all but Im not a fan of so much caramel malt in my DIPAs. Its a fairly balanced DIPA for a West Coast offering.

22oz bomber of Summer (07) Yulesmith.

1. Thanks for the recommendations-fellow BAs. The IPA recommendation column. This one has proven to be one of my favorite of the style so far.

2. Is this worth the hype??...yes it definitely is.

3. Well I was a bit scared to try this hop monster (since I was looking for the Xmas Yulesmith)

A-Body is a nice foggy rusty amber hue with plenty of cloudiness. Brew Pours with a big foamy 3 finger head that slowly fades to 1 finger and has perfect retention. Plenty of lacing is left behind in the glass (and the bottle). As I said with Alesmith IPA, I love the appearance of a good bottle fermented ale-and this is something you dont normally find with IPAs. Tiny bubbles constantly rise to the top (and Im drinking this from a standard pint glass not my tulip or chalice which is designed to enhance appearance.)

S- Big nose full of citrus hops-strong on grapefruit and refreshing-almost minty-pine hops. Subtly in the background is a nice caramel malt sweetness.

T- Big hop taste upfront. Refreshing piny hops make a big presence early in the taste with a background of citrus hop flavor and caramel malt. The finish is a big burst of piny and spicy hops with a subtlety of citrus hops and caramel malt rushing in to balance the flavor out. What lingers is low, but present, residual bitterness, lots of piny hop flavor, spicy hop flavor and a balance of sweet, bready malt.

P- Medium carbonation. Body is very oily, slightly yeasty, and smooth and creamy.

O- Bottle says 8.5% ABV yet it drinks like a session ale. There is not even a hint of alcohol warming at the end of the taste. This, indeed is one of my favorite DIPAs. I will make the trip out to OH just to buy more than one of these bottles next summer. I cant wait to try the winter version!

1184,"2010-02-18",4.2,"Bomber via trade with phaleslu, thanks Peter! Pours hazy peachy, pale copper with a chunky 2-3 finger off white yellowish head that has great retention and leaves nice sheets of lacing. Aroma is caramel, pink grapefruit flesh, orange blossom, light biscuit, a pleasant touch of pine, a sweet grainy note and a nice hint of melon on the tail end. Nice, there is a mellow, sweet smelling almost nutty note that I cant pin down too. Flavor is caramel, husky grain, sweet orange, toasted white bread, a very appealing pine note, fruity floral hops, and again a sweet nutty note that I cant quite describe, almost like a sweet almond, but not quite. Finishes with dark caramel, sweet orange, pink grapefruit, a touch of young pine needles and a nice grassiness.  Palate is medium bodied, and moderately carbonated with a creamy entry and off dry, though still slightly creamy finish. A really nice IIPA I think it has probably lost some of its original pep (being something like 8 months old), but retains a nice, hoppy character. I really have to try to get my mitts on this when its fresh.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"
1184,"2010-02-13",4.0,"Hazy orange colour with a dense white head that leaves some amazing lazing on the snifter. Aroma is very balanced of fruity and very light caramelly malt, fruity and piney, slightly perfumey hops with prominent grapefruit notes. Flavour delivers what the aroma promises plus a big dose of sweet fruity malts and a more than expected bitter and dry finish. Very balanced, clean and drinkable (like a 6-7ABV IPA.) Mouthfeel is lively with quite harsh carbonation, keeps things drinkable though, dangerously so. Another winner from Alesmith  which would probably have blowed my mind if I tried a truly fresh bottle..","Malmö, SWEDEN","andersand"

The aroma is lush with evergreen and bright zesty citrus notes.  The malt lends a subtly sweet toffee and biscuit layer to the aroma.  Evergreen and juniper flavors jump out at first and quickly blend in with lots of fresh grapefruit and orange notes.  Toasty and sweet caramel malt flavor rounds it out with some lingering honey and bitterness on the finish.

The flavor doesnt quite live up to that, but still has nice notes of orange and grapefruit citrus, caramel malts, floral hops, honey, pineapple, and pine.  Some warming alcohol.  Light-medium bodied, with a good bite from the carbonation, very crisp.  Bitter and sweet all the way through, even in the aftertaste, which has hops and honey.

flavor is based in sweet malts, and with lots of hops added, bitter pine and faint grape dominates, the flowery hops are way in the background. flavor is more extreme hoppy than aroma, but stil very drinkable.

Well-disguised ABV doesnt reveal until the burn going down the esophagus.  A well done summertime ale with a refreshing quality produced in large part, I feel, by the high carbonation and lack of bitterness overload sometimes found in this style.  Nice stuff.

1184,"2009-07-09",3.9,"Draught at the brewery.   The last Alesmith bottle release that I have yet to have, and irony-of-ironies, I have it on-tap at the brewery.   Warmed up with a sampler of the regular IPA to get my palate in order.   Came with an orange color and sticky head.   Fruity and somewhat yeasty aroma with grapefruit, mint, and peach.   There is also some nutty malt.   The flavor has soft, fruity hops and more bready malt sweetness than I was expecting.   Lower on the bitterness scale, with a good balance that is almost too malty.   Nice, though not the dry hop bomb that I had come to love after a day and a half of local IPAs","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

1184,"2009-07-09",4.1,"2009 bottle from brewery ($7.50).  Pours a light amber color with very big and very white fluffy head.  I think this head has the longest staying power I have yet seen in an IPA/IIPA.  Aroma is all about the bitter-sweet grapefruit but there are also hints of the pine forest I was mountain biking in last weekend in northern California.  More juicy grapefruit and pine in the flavor.  Starts with a light maltiness and light sweetness and quickly moves into the hoppy bitterness which lingers at the back of the tongue.  This is well-balanced and not over the top like many double IPAs.  Refreshing and a high level of drinkability.","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"

1184,"2009-07-04",3.8,"Bottle with big thanks to zinister!  Seemed to be a fitting choice for independence day.  Aroma is pineapple, citrus hops, strong malt, some fruity notes, and spice.  Smells kind of like barleywine. Flavor is very sweet and malty up front with notes of cinnamon and clove.  Then the hops kick in to balance it out.  The hops are not as prominent as I expected.  More of a balancing flavor to counter the sweetness.  Hops are piny with notes of pineapple in the finish, but certainly more of a background flavor.  I think this bottle may have had some age on it which is fine with me, I occasionally like IPAs with some age on them; more like hoppy balanced barleywine.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"

Poured out fairly hazy dark orange / brown brew with lots of miniscule stuff trapped. Got a big, thick light tan creamy cap with incredible retention and guinness like lacing. The aroma is awesome and comes across thick with caramel malt to along with weak pine, tons of citrus (orange, grapefruit), tart raspberry hard candy, and a touch of wood me thinks. The taste is awesome as well: sweet all the way through with lemon and pine hops, mint, caramel and chocolate. Very smooth mouth feel, full bodied and clean, good malty finish with a bitterness that does not overwhelm the taste buds. Excellent beer","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"
1184,"2009-06-11",4.0,"Thanks again Dove for smuggeling this back for us. Beer appears rich dark brown and has a thick brown cap with good retention the lacing was very ropy, brew looks good but almost too dark brown for the style. Brew smells sweet with lemon lime style hops and a very light malt presence that has chocolaty tones, spices are noticeable and Im thinking they are coriander. The aroma was way milder then I was expecting it to be. Tasty brew without being overly aggressive, lemon lime hops dominate as they should and the slightly chocolaty malts become more noticeable as the beer warms, wood and a tasty alcohol presence also start to show the more the beer warms. The mouth feel is full and fizzy, a soapy after taste lingers after every sip. Very tasty beer that was milder then I was expecting this is a IIPA I can drink all night.

1184,"2009-05-29",4.3,"Pours a gorgeous ruby with tight beige head that lasts forever. There isnt lacing so much as there is a defiant coasting. Carbonation bubbles up resiliently till the bitter end. Aroma is so powerful; huge grapefruit notes, floral aspects are out of this world, and grassy resinous qualities make make themselves known with vigor. Nearly every appreciable hop quality is present. Flavor hits first with a massive kick of hop resin, followed by sweet woody caramel and molasses malt. Citrus aspects of the nose are not nearly as prevalent in the flavor, rather they are replaced by more resinous flavors such as grass and pine. Malt balance is excellent, providing a great degree of sweetness to counteract the hop battering. Palate is velvety and caressing, leaving a slight alcohol warming and a decidedly dry finish. This brew is put together quite masterfully. Hop character is expounded upon profoundly, balance is phenomenal, and palate is about as good as you can get from the style. I want more.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
1184,"2009-05-29",4.3,"big thanks to oteyj for this one. Pours a gorgeous ruby with a great frothy head. Aroma is wondrous- orange, grapefruit, pineapple; very sweet, but also the epic and complex presence of floral and resinous hops. Flavor has tremendous malt character, and then the hops return- absurdly well balanced. Vanilla and molasses are the predominant traits of the malt flavor, and the hops shift to include a lot of pine flavor, with less citrus. Outside of the glass is now coated, rather than laced.

Soft golden hue and a creamy dense head that proudly rises above the glass.  Tasty and fiercely bitter, but plenty astringent too.  Raw alcohol in the finish.  This was out of refrigeration in the store and I had it a few months after the release so while I know it to be good, I imagine it’s much better when fresh.

1184,"2008-09-01",4.4,"bomber into pint glass.  The aroma is pretty inbelievable and quite possibly the best hop aroma I have encountered (reminded me a bit of Hop Slam, but better than what I remember of it).  All juicy citrus hops with a great floral character too (even some pine hops, which I am detecting further down the glass) that is in such impeccable balance that I cant really explain it.  This is also not to mention the extreme potency; when I poured this I could smell it throughout the room.  Beneath the great hops one can detect a hint of sweet pale malt... yum. Im not one for the color of this brew or the color of its head (very light copper golden body with an all white head), but the creaminess of the head that the lace it leaves is litterally perfect (perhaps the best lacing I have encountered also). Crystal clear without much visible carbonation.  The hops on the flavor are also, as expected, off the chain with all varieties of hops - citrus, pine, floral and bittering.  It has pine hops upfront that fade into citrus and finish with a dry as hell bitterness.  As it warms the malt comes out on the swallow and finish too - rich thick pale malt.  This thing is hot but smooth on the palate, medium to thick bodied with a rich maltyness.  Overall: this may be the ultimate in hoppy beers, and I am actually a bit surprised that it isnt rated higher.  (after submitting my original rating... I checked my raitings and I gave dreadnaught 1 point higher but can;t imagine it having been any better... I need to try these side by side and crown the victor.)

A tad astringent and puckering, leaves a layer of bitterness on the center of the tongue. Not a double IPA you want to rush. Very velvety and delightful.

The nose is booming!  Notes of orange and lemon chiffon, grapefruit, and pine hops are accompanied by a sweet but unobtrusive toffee malt background.   The flavor is equally impressive, with massive citrus and pine notes being tempered by a touch of lactic cream and sweet but appropriate toffee malts.  Crushing bitterness, but sufficient malt sweetness for balance.  The body is about as big as it gets for the style, but never gets to be overly cloying.

The aroma is big on citrus hops up front with grapefruit and oranges but also a noticeable pine hop scent as well.  There is a faint caramel malt scent as well but the hops are the star in this one.

The taste mirrors the aroma with a huge citrus hop kick up front, mainly grapefruit.  This gives way temporarily to a more bready malt backbone before the pine hops kick in and give a nice bitter finish that lingers for a while.

Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and sticky with hop oils.  It just coats the mouth with hoppy goodness.

This is an extremely drinkable DIPA and is another great offering from AleSmith who rarely, if ever, disappoint.  Probably a top 5 DIPA in my book.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
1184,"2008-06-16",3.5,"Found out this was a 2007 bottle after the fact.  Thought I had gotten a fresh 2008 bottle but alas I was mistaken.  The pour is a dull copper color with some light cloudiness to it, a sticky off-white head that was creamy and produced good lacing all the way down the glass.  The aroma was mild pine, floral and thin citrus.  A bit of tea as well.  Some light caramel maltiness.  The flavor was pine, floral and malt with plenty of dry tea.  I tend to associate that dry tea flavor with IPAs and DIPAs that are past their prime.  The mouthfeel was nice and the finish was bone dry.  Definitely want a do over once the 08 is released.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","Soonah"
1184,"2008-06-10",3.7,"The color was hazy peach.  The head was creamy and off-white.  The aroma was fermented fruit, hops, and malt.  The flavor was malty, waxy/bitter, and hoppy.  It was surprisingly not hoppy.  We think this is because it was exposed to some harsh temperatures.  The palate was full-bodied.  The finish was waxy.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","aubreya"
1184,"2008-06-10",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2008 Recently had this fresh and updated my rating. The nose was much more citrusy and hoppy fresh, C hops for sure, grapefruit, apricot, sweet resiny hops with a nice sweet malt background. The flavor is really malty, caramel, citrusy, grapefruit peel, earthy, a lite dry alcohol feel. Even fresh the hops in the flavor were very subdued, not juicy at all. More bitter and astringent than I would like. Creamy full mouthfeel with little bitterness and a bit of warmth. Finishes citrusy and earthy.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"

This double IPA is really lacking in roasty flavor.  Kind of suprising, but nice. A great beer for a hop-head in Southern California during summer!","Orange, California, USA","chrisafari"

A- Pours an orangey golden hue with a massive head and tons of carbonation present. The carbonation reminds me of the fireworks on the bottle.

S- Deep Piney hops with a seemingly thick malty backbone. A bit resiny.

T- Taste is lots of piney hops that have a bitter kick followed by a sweet malt finish that counters the hops very well. Im more of a fan of grapefruit/cirtus ipas and DIPAs but this one is very well crafted.

M- A bit bubbly and not nearly as thick as I originally would have thought.

D- This is certainly not the most drinkable IPA but the balance lends to it being easy to consume.","California, USA","Lothore"

1184,"2008-03-08",4.1,"Pours a cloudy yellow-amber with white head that fades fast.  aroma is citrus/hops and some sweetness maybe because of the faded hops as this bottle has to be from summer 2007.  Flavor is wood, spice and sweetness. Mouthfeel is oily.  I like the overall flavor of this beer even though its more hop dominated fresh.  I think the sweet hop fade is nice for this particular brew.  Finish is great with that wood flavor and alcohol just building the depth of the beer.  Perfect alcohol balance.

Powerful smells of pine and grapefruit from far away.  Closer to the glass the nose reflects lemons, spice and grass.  Fairly heavy and syrupy mouthfeel, with some lasting sweetness easing the lasting bitterness of the hops.  Flavor is very well rounded with heavy flavor of orange, lemon, grapefruit and pine but also a distinct malt sweetness of candy, cornbread and biscuit.  I think the beauty of this IIPA is in the subtlety of it.  Strong aromas and flavors dont really overpower your palate, instead they combine for a very drinkable but strong brew.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"

Medium-bodied and creamy, while on the tongue, the palate transitions to a lightly dry and lingeringly bitter finish. Huge grapefruit hops and a solid, malty caramel backing finish with a green, woody-dry conclusion that hints at a bit of spruce-like hops. This is a very nice beer.

1184,"2007-12-30",4.5,"2007 Version, 22oz bomber. This beer pours an orangish amber color from the bottle. Huge frothy, dense head. I let the bottle glug once as I poured and the head grew to about 3"" thick. As it subsided it laced the entire glass like a spider web. Nothing like the heads on the brews from Alesmith (decadence, yulesmith, ipa, etc.). Not a huge nose, smells a little soapy. Deep citrus undertones and a little grassy as well.
The taste of this brew explodes in my mouth. Sweet up front but as I swallow there is a burst of bitter-sweet hop flavors. This brew is a benchmark for DiPas. Not too thick, not too thin, just perfect. Great carbonation as shown by the head on this brew. I really dont remember this brew being this good.

Smells of pungent, bright fruit, lemon-lime and tangerine hops over sweet, mild malts.  Tastes of bright citrus hops with little malt flavor but a pleasantly smooth, rich mouthfeel.  The malt component emerges more on the finish, which is also marked by a lingering hop bitterness.

It starts with the ridiculously thick foam that foreshadows the extremely rich texture; but in another sense it is light, in that it doesnt have much toast/ caramel/ crystal malt flavor; it does have a touch of sweetness, which only seems to enhance the enjoyment of the hop bitterness.   But its the smell that seals the deal - if you like citrus fruit bright hops more than piney-resin smells, this is for you.  The bitterness is powerful but not quite in the Ive got more IBU s thn you camp.  A definite contender for my desert island brew.","San Diego, California, USA","IEBAILI"

This bottle is still not fresh (somehow very hard for me to find this fresh - this year was in NorCal for the fourth) but within weeks.  Nose is a pleasing sort of grassy strawberry hop (not fervent berry, just not pine or resin).  Color is a great glowing gold thats hazy and even.  Flavor is balanced, crisp, full of the aroma but with a sharper finish.

1184,"2007-12-04",4.1,"Review #300 for me. Summer edition.

A: Beautiful brilliant vermilion body with a bunch of visible carbonation. It is topped by a nice fluffy white head. The body has the slightest bit of cloudiness to it but is otherwise beautiful.

S: Like a pine forest jammed into the glass. The aroma is primarily pine but is backed by caramel and some heavy malt.

T: Just like the flavor, only more balanced. Pine is dominant but the malt backbone is strong enough to maintain a balanced beer. Some of the caramel is present and becomes more evident in the late aftertaste which leaves a nice caramel sweetness on the tongue. Bitterness is strong but not overwhelming.

M: Very nice body for a DIPA. Its on the heavy end without being too thick. I think that the piney hop aroma and bitterness make it seem a bit heavier than it really is.

D: Im more partial to the citrusy hops than the piney version but this is pretty good. Alcohol is hidden well.","Troy, New York, USA","drseamus"

Rating #650 - I saw this at Chucks a week or so ago and decided it would make a nice treat for a milestone rating.  The price was not bad either though enough that I probably will be picking up the regular IPA instead next time I want something hoppy from Alesmith.  This is an excellent beer that deserves its place as a borderline Top 50 beer.  I would place it among one of the better Imperial IPAs I have tried; perhaps I will get another bottle when it is fresh to see if that changes things.
Aroma / Appearance - The clear body let through about half the sunlight that trickled lazily into the tulip glass.  A short lived head surged to the top before settling to almost nothing.  Strong citrus notes made me think of the weather a month ago - moderately warm with the leaves still on the trees and a light breeze blowing the smell of fall around. 
Flavor / Palate - The taste of orange creamsicle coated my mouth before being overwhelmed by spiciness and a tinge of malts.  The alcohol is not subtle but still manages to remain under control.  For an imperial IPA it was a little peppery.  I found it to be very drinkable and easy to finish.  It falls just shy of my Top 50 though I can see why it is one of the most highly ranked of the style.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1184,"2007-11-24",3.4,"22oz bottle purchased for $4 (half-price, they say - its November) from Bauer Wines in Boston.  Pours with a ridiculous unforgiving head that is delaying my consumption and enjoyment of this beer.  Underneath the head there is a thin sliver of cloudy light gold.  Strong bitter aroma.  Whoa, this is strong stuff.  Tastes more like hard liquor than a beer on first taste.  Lets checkie the ol ABV...  only 8.5%!  For a second I was wondering if this was in the 12%+ range.  I swear, Im getting some weak whisky tastes here (disclaimer: not a whisky drinker).  Took a quick look at reviews on here and dont see anyone concurring with me - wonder if mine has spoiled at all?  OK, as the beer goes on, the review progresses.  Im getting a bit less of the whiskey flavours, but Im still not getting what I consider to be typical hoppiness from the style.  An hour later, I just tried pouring the last third of the bottle and the process creates as much head in the bottle as there is beer.  What is going on with this bottle?  It pains me a bit to give such a highly rated beer (100th percentile!) a mediocre score, but I cannot tell a lie when it comes to this bottle.  An experience, none-the-less.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","sstackho"

Nice Imperial IPA. Had it in between Ruination so I compared it to that. This was pretty thick and domineering for an IPA but not over powering.

Taste is primarily the citrus hops (grapefruit predominantly) with some hop resin and pine mixed in for good measure.  Was expecting a bit more maltiness based on the nose.

It has a very bubbly, glowing orange sun-burnt red colored body, moderately effervescent, with columns of bubbles rapidly floating to the top of the glass.  Has an amazingly rich and hoppy/dank fruity nose of overripe oranges, mangos, and grapefruit, with a heavy maltiness (imperial red-ish), that actually is the problem I find with this beer.  The hop profile is spot on, but the body is too malty and it tends to distract from the hops.  Almost seems like it has some light oxidation, with some floral olive flavors showing up, but that could just be me.

Flavor is what I was hoping for, a big hoppy front to a slightly sweet caramel backbone.  Hops are off the hook in this badboy!   Its not nearly as sweet as say 90 minute, but thats not a bad thing.  Somehow theyve balanced the super-hoppy with the malt VERY well.  I dont know if Ive had a better IIPA.","Waldo, Ohio, USA","danglefruit"
1184,"2007-08-22",4.2,"Bottle.  Pour is a coppery orange color and sports a pretty large head (about three figners of foam at first).  Aromas are mindnumbing.  I am fairly giddy at this point as Im picking up the pine and pineapple that means good IPA hops and a slight caramel backbone from the malt.  Flavor is much more bitter that I anticipated.  The malt definitely is there and holds the hoppy bitterness in check, but as far as IPAs go, this one leans to the hoppy end of the spectrum.  This is interesting considering that the Winter version heads much more in the malt direction if memory serves me well.  Either way, Im not sure which of the twins I would rather take home.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

Poured into a tulip glass with a big head that just wont go away and eventually turns into a surface covering lacing.  Color is murky dark orange, cannot see through the beer.  Aroma is in general  strong, sweet, citrus-tea.   Its surrounded by some nice perfume-y, bitter tangerine and a light earthiness (the only aspect that seems independent of the hops.  Taste is medium-strong bitterness, with light pine but mostly a thick citrus.  A medium body and a long citrus/bitter aftertaste.

Alright, this makes sense, the Summer Yulesmith has been renamed. This DIPA is not longer as exciting as it was 9 years ago. OMG! Why am I still on ratebeer.

Taste is bitter, smooth, with a creamy mouthfeel and a thick smack of tasty, sweet hops throughout the entire thing.  Beautiful.  This is certainly one of the best 2 or 3 IIPAs Ive had.

Flavor Is much the same except the hops get a little more perfumey.  Bitterness ends up around a 6 (out of 10) at its peak, kept in check by a good amount of caramel sweetness.  Burps citrus and pine needles.  A bit overcarbonated with a medium body.

Pours  a nice yellow-orange with a huge offwhite head. Spectacular hop aroma, floral and grapefruit, wonderfully leafy and juicy; Im feeling generous but today this one nearly pulls a 10. 
The flavor is less impressive; a strong powerful bitterness (resin, orange peel) mingles with a somewhat vegatal off-taste as the malts step up and try to make themselves known. The flavor avoids the sweet caramel IIPA trap, but it doesnt have the juicy loveliness of say Moynans hopsickle. We do get an impressively bitter, Ruinition-style long end of the finish. Mouthfeel is warm and a little bit sticky , but not too much so for an IIPA.

Overall, its a very nice beer, but its not necessarily the holy grain of hops that I thought it might have been. So far as inaccessible-in-Washington hop bombs from San Diego go, Id prefer a Green Flash IPA any day.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

The beer pours out a nice orange with a decent head after three years. The aroma is light hops and a hint of citrus. Taste is much more mellow than design due to the age but still some decent hops present. Some malty sweetness comes out with the citrus flavors hitting you at the end. I have to say I enjoyed this one.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","rayg1"

Anyhow, this pours a a warm light golden brown with a relatively insignificant thin dense offwhite head.  The nose is far from insignificant.  Great big hops come out and bite me in the nose.  Light sweet pale malts mix well with citrusy hops.  In the mouth this is a nice creamy dream.  Foaming up just right, but thick enough on its own anyways.  A bit of alcohol warming, nice.  The flavor is the star of the show in this beer, all else was prelude.  A sumptuous marriage of sweet rich malt with aggressive hops.  Light and sweet to slightly caramel malts with big in your face citrus to slightly piney and herbal hops.  The finish really gets you on the sides of the tongue and down in the back with the bitterness, while the sweetness is still obvious.  The aftertaste is the big hops with hints of vanilla.  This beer finds balance in a territory of sweetness where most brews are off kilter.  A really nice beverage, if only I could get it locally! 

Update: January 11, 2008.  I had another bottle.  Less impressed this time.  Hops were more subdued.  The malt stood out a bit more.  I guess this is what you expect from an IIPA with age on it.  It wasnt bad, dont get me wrong, but it was different.  I think with another year on it... it could have been lovlier.

1184,"2006-12-21",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2007 22 Oz Bottle. An old familiar friend leaps from the glass, Cascade hops. Backed up by some other pals and a toothsome glow of sweet oranges and persimmons. Sultry, sophisticated and delightful. Pours a clear, pale amber, fringed with a nice off-white lace. On the tongue, a pink peppercorn glow, with copious resin, hard biting citrus pine and long lasting white fir needles. Malt gets swept under the rug, in preparation for a true hop fanfare, however, its bit planty and coarse to me, with some heavily biting and edges and swift kick of hot alcohols. Theres a peculiar amalgamation of bright pales fruits and dripping resonation saps. Excruciatingly dry, leaving and almost unpleasant wasp of pine nectar coating the tongue. Im struggling with this summer version, it doesnt work as well for me. This needs more malts, less bitterness and a more congealed alcohol presence. Lots of spice and pepper, however uniform.

1184,"2006-10-15",4.0,"As I spend time in France and Belgium I often feel an urge to revisit styles such as the IIPA upon my return to America. Though experience tells me that these hoppiest of beers are decidedly unfit for my palate, I find myself momentarily craving their quixotic flavor after a consecution of graceful efforts. YuleSmith was to be just that, a sacrifice to appease my palate, and remind myself why I so often dismiss the entire style. As my first taste of AleSmith (courtesy of FlacoAlto), my expectations were logically clashing by virtue of the brewers revered status and my apathy towards IIPAs. The beer amazes upon my delicate pour, revealing a brooding pumpkin hue packed with a dusty yellow cake which proceeds to metamorphose into what seems a feudal citadel circumscribed by its appropriate trench and barricaded in thick lace. The nose is initially dominated by rich mango nectar  and juicy aromas of orange and pineapple. Biscuity malts, characterized by burnt butter and an alcoholic cedar quality perform as the primary base for an exciting array of scents including black pepper, coriander, ginger, spruce and a hint of grapefruit. Hops are evident in the aroma, but attain their full potency on the tongue beside prominent coriander, caramel malts and café au lait. The flavor appears rich at first, building to a creamy apex before a generic hoppy and spicy burn emerges to clumsily seal the palate in an inevitable bitterness. An appeasing apple flavor appears in the aftertaste, but I found the finishing tones rather disappointing. Nonetheless, YuleSmith is to me one of the most enjoyable examples of the style and an excellent introduction to AleSmiths potential.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

BIG aroma of fresh hops, lots of swet malt, some fruit, yeast and spices -- but mostly those wonderful smelling hops! Flavours sweet and hoppy, very well balanced and oh so delicious. Starts kind of sweet and then BAM! -- a tasty hop medley, followed by a big, dry bitter finish. This is sooo easy to drink and theres no sign of the 8.5% alcohol. Medium to full bodied. Simply fantastic, definitely one of the worlds best IPAs.

1184,"2006-10-12",4.3,"From 22oz Bottle.  Beautiful pour of blood oranges, caramelized to a beechwood amber hue.  Refined crown of creamy, long lasting ivory head rests on top.  Aromas of citrusy white grapefruit pulp and wild orange zest creates a spicy hoppiness, tamed by a base of vanilla, caramel, and sugar cookie malts.  I did a double take when I first observed the vanilla presence during my tasting, but seeing it now in the commercial description forces me to comment that not only is it there, but it adds an incredible dimension to the aroma and flavor qualities of this brew.  Medium bodied, refreshing correctly carbonated mouthfeel.  Amazing flavor complexity and layers.  The pleasant malt flavors grip my tongue immediately, oozing with hints of caramel, cookie dough, and some sweet, gentle cinnimon spice.  Not to be outdone, the hoppy punch quickly follows up the glorious malt brigade.  Spicy flavors of grapefruit, spruce, and white pepper flood my palate, scrubbing it clean and preparing it for the next wave of malty goodness.  Im definitely guessing that centennial plays an important role in the hop schedule, but the complexity of the flavors are enough to keep me guessing, and frankly not really care.  The final smack contains a deceivingly strong hop bitterness that firmly sets me back into the true groove of this style.  Fantastic overall - I must comment that when I rave about the sweet and malty characteristics of the brew, Im definitely keeping in mind their level of appropriatenesss for the style.  The rich balance between hops and malts is really a showcase for the potential this style has to offer when crafted by a creative brewer.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

1184,"2006-09-19",3.3,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2007 2/17/07.  Poured out of 22 oz. bottle, bought at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA 8/20/06.  Rated blind.  Vintage 2006, I do believe.  Extremely dark brown-purple in color like a dark grape or fig skin, pouring with a lumpy head of uneven, pea-sized light tan suds.  Deep orange-copper in color when held up to light.  Head fades rather quickly to a lumpy film.  Lacing is very sticky but sadly lean (after the head fades), although sub-surface reverse lacing is exquisite.  Aroma starts out fairly bold and promising, with some orange zest and sweet notes of dark caramel, brown sugar, and some hints of dark taffy and lighter caramel-like fudge; lots of fruitiness but on the darker dried fruit end, with a bright date-like character.  A touch of sweat-soaked-leathery tanginess that isnt quite as off-putting as it sounds because its so slight.  Aroma fades quite a bit as it opens up, starting out with that lovely aged barley wine profile, ending up fairly nondescript with only a bare bones lightly-sweetened spiced toast presence.  Flavor is decidedly drier and more subdued, really relying on straight toasty and caramel malts with only the softest brown sugar suggestions.  Seems more like a solid-but-unspectacular amber or red ale, underhopped and drinkable but fairly uninteresting.  Its subtle and thankfully not sugar-saturated like the aroma might have suggested at first, but theres not really that much of note.  Hop citrus and bitterness have disappeared.  Sort of a funny foot character that I remember somewhat similarly from Oggis Tricentennial Barley Wine, but it was much more extreme (and interesting) in that beerI think its an odd effect of oxidation.  Again, not as bad as it sounds, but not terribly exciting either.  Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a gently tingling carbonation and slight scratchiness from an earthy, soggy hop presence.  Not really any bitterness, but theres a definite fuzzy textural component that I think came from the hops, and becomes more directly textural with the oxidation.  This aspect of the finish actually lingers around quite awhile, but its not much to get excited about.  A bit watery, especially in the finish.  Flabby and really just pretty boring.  No alcohol presence whatsoever, which is good.  But theres very little else thats very good.  I was actually pretty optimistic on my first whiff, but everything fell apart so quickly.  It gets less and less interesting as I work through the bottle, almost like its not even there towards the end.  I didnt even bother to finish the whole bomber, and I barely even noticed.  After the reveal:  Wow.  No idea.  Not 100% sure of this vintage, but 90% sure.  Not good. (7/4/6/3/12 - 3.2)

9/18/06.  Poured out of 22 oz. bottle, bought at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA 8/20/06.  Pours a stately, lightly hazy bright orange with a fluffy, sudsy and well-retained tan-cream head.  Lacing drifts in slow, tightly-woven sheets, leaving sticky, irregular, residual patches.  Aroma drifts forth with an orange zest zippiness and an inviting piney, floral softness, something I fear that has already faded even at this young age.  There are also traces of raw alcohol that hide just beneath a zesty citrus zip.  Too much alcohol presence even in the aroma, but a little more brightness and a little less alcohol, and this could be magical.  Flavor is lacking a bit even from there, with an immediate oxidized malt and nondescript, slightly abrasive hop character.  As a bit of excited fun, there are pockets of sharp hop oils popping against the sides of the mouth, but the flavoring and dry hops are sort of lacking compared to what Ive come to know from my SoCal Imperial IPAs.  The malt is papery and bland, not quite even an adequate blank slate for the hops to dance their colorful masquerade (or in this case, their clumsy shuffle).  Sticky on the lips with a medium-full body.  Mostly compact carbonation, but the texture feels a little off because of the scratchy hop prickle.  Grassy, itchy, dry finish, with a straw-like bitterness that lasts long but lacks the hop juiciness that I want.  The finish is easily the weakest part of the beer, provoking sip after sip to cover its harshness; it begs you to drink this beast faster than the high octane would normally prescribe.  Still a solid brew, if heavily flawed, but not close to the lovely hop treat we get each Christmas.  (7/5/7/3/13 - 3.5)

1184,"2006-09-18",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2007 Thanks to some handy mercantilism and bartering on the behalf of my fellow Ratebeerian Kepano, we were able to secure our first bottle from AleSmith.  Ever.  Thats because we are so unfortunate as to be in the outer, forgotten orbits of distribution for San Diego breweries.  Ours is apparently a barren world, like the scarred face of the moon.  They simply think that even if life exists in these craggy lands of Colorado, surely it cant have evolved past an invertebrate rasping tongue whos primitive licking motion is far better suited to eroding mollusk shells in the hope of a docile meal rather than tasting the toothsome crafts coming from AleSmith.  End rant.  YuleSmith Summer is a deservedly well praised beer.  Let us begin with the head: a commodious raft of tan foam plumping up and above the glass in a terrifying tower of chemical cohesion and sheer magic.  This then settles into a more manageable cork of bubbles, and finally sinks into an inverse crater, like a pleateau surrounded by a medieval moat.  Whoah.  And thats before I even smelled the beer.  After the many varied faces of YuleSmiths presentation I catch a whiff of a syncretic wonder  ginger, cloves, pine, sassafras, ethanol, orange pith, pepper, pork tenderloin, oats and celery salt.  The pork tenderloin part of that voluminous list had my salivating glands in a frenzy, to say nothing of the other complementary aromas (and other bits and pieces of my digestive system).  But heres where I vex myself  where self-reclamation, martyrdom and a philosophical flogging all crash together.  Ive never been good with Double IPAs, or any extreme of flavor for that matter.  Anything Imperial subdues me more viciously than the empires subdued colonies of old.  This beer included.  Yes, it has something of a balanced hops-malt character to it, in an IPA style.  But to me it hits hard, dry and tinny.  A little time on the tongue catches a preliminary glow of apple which collapses soon after into a long, windy gust of hops and bitterness.  It then loiters for much, much too long forcing ample time between sips, and furthermore keeping me looking like an IPA sophist.  Im too much of a coward  too weak and too flimsy.  YuleSmith Summer burns like a thorny sting of a thousand displeased bees at a time when everyone else seems to think its their heavenly honey.  It was, however, a pleasure nonetheless, if not for the spectacular architectural phantasmagoria or the entrancing smell, then only to have at last met a famous AleSmith.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

This beer is brilliantly clear and pours a full reddish copper color and is topped by a frothy, light tan head. The aroma is full and hoppy with notes of fresh cut herbs, pine, grapefruit, and bergamot. The beer is sweet up front with a hint of cinnamon mixed in with the abundant hop notes. There is also a good maltiness to this beer, which really helps to hold the hops in check and provide some sort of balance. The hops are sharp and biting from finish to end. As the beer leaves my mouth a slow spicy sharp astringency begins to build for a good half minute span. This beer is still just damn good, so well balanced between the aggressive over the top hoppiness and a solid maltiness, which while definitely playing second fiddle, is still present enough to contribute and tame some of the hop notes.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Honestly I think this is a different recipe then the winter.  Pours cloudy amber.  Amazingly strong hoppy smell.  It has a complex lingering bitter hoppy taste.  It is also sweet.  Although I love Alesmith, this brew has to come second in my book for Imperial IPAs when compared to Dogfish 90.  If you can find it grab it.  Keep up the good work your brilliant beer makers.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"

This one is for serious beer pros only.

Full bodied beer with generous soft carbonation.  Incredibly well balanced - thick rich caramel malt and piney citrus hops - almost a creamy feel to the taste.

1184,"2006-07-08",3.3,"I am terribly confused.  I got a bottle of this expecting a double IPA, but it tasted nothing of the sort.  It was very Belgian tasting.  It had a kind of floral aroma, but mostly caramel and yeast.  The flavor was quite yeasty and sweet, similar to Horny Devil actually.  Is there some chance I got the wrong beer?  Is there another Yulesmith beer that Alesmith makes?  Its the same bottle as shown.  I love Alesmith IPA, but if Im judging this as an IIPA, I couldnt give it much over a 3, but if it was something else, surely higher.  Ill try and find it again and see what happens.

You cant miss with AleSmith.  Rerate - this was one of the first beers I really rated.  So,  I guess this is an important rerate.

1184,"2006-06-04",4.3,"Bomber. Im absolutely buying everything the brewer claims for this beer: citrus and florals on the nose, and an attack that starts hoppy and grows malty and sweet, even to the point of vanilla. Theres a decent off-white head, dark copper color, body on the high side of medium, and plenty of carb (without being an overabundance). The finish is dry and lingering. After rousing the yeast, it takes on a more pronounced fruitiness and the malt sweetness takes up a new emphasis as well. This is a fantastic IIPA with and without yeast in the glass.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Aroma of pine, mint, oak and vanilla all appear over a beautiful toasty malt backbone. Some subtle chewy/earthy resins underneath.  Smells like a walk in the woods.  Some rich seasonal spices as well like juniper and ginger.  Flavour delivers on the aromas promise, tooth coating piny resins are topped by the sweet caramel and biscuity malts.

1184,"2006-05-08",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 6, 2006 On tap:  I dont get what all the fuss is about with this one.  I have read pages and pages back on the reviews of this beer, and many people talk about it as though it is an extremely hoppy beer.  I have now had the beer several times, and it pours relatively dark, and is VERY malty, with very little hop backing.  Very sweet, somewhat strong on the alcohol. Strong nutmeg taste.  A supremely overrated beer from a great brewery.   In my opinion, even good brewers can make average beers.  

UPDATE:  I officially like the Summer Version.  I stick by my review --- The Winter is gross, the summer kicks ass.  Why in the world are there not two seperate entries for this beer?  They are completely different.

1184,"2006-04-03",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2009 Bomber picked up in 2008, consumed 11-13-2009.  Big, off-white head, fluffy, lumpy, rings, sheets, and cross-thatch of lace.  Body is orange-hued, hazy, and sparkling in a soothing manner--not hyperactive like champaign, but steady and plentiful.  The aroma is honeyed, floral, bready, light notes of orange julius and pine.  The body is medium-full, with a little coarse carbonation, an almost velvety palate, and a dry finish.  It feels nice in the mouth.  After all these months the beer is still hoppy-yet-balanced.  Up front its honeyed, heavily floral, and then it breaks into a yeasty dough, almost sour.  While the hops are present throughout, theyre layered beneath the other flavors and gradually come to the top: tons of flowers with pine, citrus notes of orange, hints of the white pulp of a grapefruit rind, almost some pineapple-like tropical notes that are blended with the slight alcoholic astringency of the finish.  Even the hoppy finish is balanced.  Im impressed that the beer is still really wonderful after aging so long as an IPA, a style that is often ruined by aging.  The beers a masterpiece.  Warming, relaxing, rewarding.        

Bottled: consumed 4-1-2006.  Huge fluffy head, lumpy as it sits down a little bit, leaving behind gobs and sheets of off-white lace.  The body beneath is amber, hazy; the head above never goes away, its big and it sticks around...the top of my beer was never seen.  Aroma is sweet and smoothe, bready and malty, balanced and rich.  Highly sniffable.  Noticeabely yeasty, citrusy, sweet, complex and dynamic.  Mouth is fullish, carbonation is light and smoothe (flattish), the finish lightly dry.  Flavor is malty and balanced.  Caramel, fruit, wheat bread dough, citrus and pine on the finish--alcohol very well hidden (although providing some warmth as it warms up).  Quite mellow for an IPA on bitterness, but this beer is BIG!  Thick, rich, aromatic, yeasty, malty...so well blended, nice and drinkable.  No rip your tonsils out bitter end...its just...pleasant...refreshing...delicious...

Its a hazy amber in color with a thick, rocky beige head that coats the glass rather than laces it, it has a strong grapefruit/pine/lemon zestl hop aroma countered by sweet caramel from the malts.  The first taste is a serious bitterness, kind of like chewing on a hop flower, but this is quickly followed by a rush of caramel.

1184,"2006-02-13",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2008 Wow, what a brew man. Pours a thick, dark honey nectar with a beautifuly spicey hop aroma. 
A complex ale indeed. When you sip, the hops hit you right up front, then the mood turns to a 
bright and spicey fruit mellowness then ""BAM"", back to massive hops. Like a three car collision at 
the Broadway curve. Totally backs up traffic for a while as you try to distinguish all the flavors 
seeping through. Citrus rind, caramel, leather, pine, malt, cream. Close your eyes and imagine 
drinking a fully decorated christmas tree...the complexities.  The alcohol is well hidden.
 I wanted to chew on it. An awsome brew. Very well balanced. 
I highly recommend any time of year, if you can find it.
 ******SUMMER YULESMITH******9 months later: Sept. 6th 2006. Pours dark honey w/ full creamy froth. Aroma is spiced w/ fresh malt and forest pine. Full nectar w/ soft residual effers. Flavors are malt driven w/ a slow approaching hopped up semi truck that swerves to hit you head on. Caramel, vanilla bean, slight leather, and lime rind.  Besides all the hopsy asprin and malt it shows a certain spicy essence. Like corriander or something. Big hopsy spicey bittering on the long finish. Another classic brew! Highly recommended.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"

I was utterly blown away by the flavors of this fabulous brew.  Creamy, silky, explosive, fullbodied, perfectly balanced between hops and malt along with a great spiciness that is almost too good to describe.  I loved this beer and I cannot wait to get my hands on more of it.  This is so much better than 3 Floyds, I cant even believe that they are on the same page of 2IPAs.

I was disappointed when I sampled this in March, but having it again (aged about one year), I was greatly impressed. Too young and the hops simply overwhelm, but after about a year, the grapefruit and lemon notes blend well with the malt backbone. Theres quite a bit of lemon zest still around, but theres also caramel and butterscotch. Notes of pine and sage come across on the nose as well.

Citrus-pine Hops were present as soon as the cap popped and are the first notion the nose picks up from the first whif from the glass but an underneath malt of carmel and chocolate persuasion comes up giving a great bitter and sweet ballanced aroma.  Sharp citrus and pine hop along with lower level carmel malt.  Not as much malt ballance as I expected, but it is there and really is just about at the right level because the bitterness in this beer is quite spectacular.  Spicey and sharp grapefruit, lemon, and pine really coat the mouth and retain their initial power.

Flavor is sweet with malt and vanilla up front, bitter fresh hops in the middle, overpowering yeast in the finish, and resinous aftertastes.  Palate is medium-thick, chewy and appropriate.

1184,"2005-12-02",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 26, 2009 The commercial description of this beer is very accurate.  The orangish copper body poured very clean and clear, and the just gently off-white head seemed to continue billowing up after I had stopped pouring.  Very good retention on the head, but Im not sure that is nessecarily a plus, lots of lacing.  The first sip is very floral tasting, bitter, and caused a warm dry sensation in my mouth.  Alcohol is very prevalent.  The hops jump out stronger and stronger with every sip and really build a unique taste on ones pallate.  I gave the pallate the lowest percent rating out of all of the categories because of the warm dry sensation.  It does make you want more and more, and I found it hard to just sit back and enjoy.  It was the only beer I had that night and I finished the whole bottle in about ten minutes.  (Fast for me).  

This beer stands very strong as far as double IPAs go.  Its unique, complex, and does not let you down.  Snaps for alesmith!!!

A good solid caramel maltiness, lovely yeasty spicyness come together with just the perfect amount of alcohol to make this truly a beer to sip and savour.

A very strong smell of grapefruit, citrus, but with a not so subtle spicey and pine smell. Taste, to me, was disappointing; pepper and pine came through too strong. I did not taste as much hops as the smell wouldve indicated. The spice/pine taste covered up the alcohol. After reading many of the reviews, I really think I could have had a ""bad"" bottle.

1184,"2005-09-09",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 10, 2006 Ah, nothing says Christmas to me like being reminded what its really like to be a Geelong supporter on an unseasonably muggy September evening, so this beer was the obvious choice... I gotta say the label is pretty ugly, but thats the only thing you could criticise appearance-wise. Deep amber colour, lotsa bubbles, big foamy head which stays to the bottom of the glass like the IPA. A nicely integrated aroma of hops (pine, resin, grass, raw vegetables) and smooth, vanilla caramel malt. Theres a bit of black pepper in this one too. It smells really good, but its still a little more refined than Id expected. If anything (and its a very minor knock) its perhaps a little simplistic (as in its just malt and hops and little else) and the hop character isnt 110% fresh. Big, thick, even syrupy malt flavour with some strawberry Chupa Chup, more piney, vegetal hops and a nice bitterness, though again its not over the top. Noticeable alcohol and a soapy and salty finish. Seems just like the IPA with a bit more of everything (which it probably is,) though the balance is slightly skewed more towards hops in this. Not quite to the standard of North Bridge Extreme for mine, though this had to travel across the Pacific, and I still think it could use more hops and less vegetabley character. And I dont know if Ive been drinking too much Belgian stuff lately or what, but I cant help but feel a beer that tastes like malt and hop and little else gets a little boring after a while, though Im sure there are brewers who would dream of having the ability to do just that. Anyway Ill stop being so negative, this stuff was grouse. Postscript: It strikes me that I never would have rated it this high if you could get anything like this in Australia (though I could easily say the same thing of lambics.) Now, after having a few more hoppy West Coast beers in Sydney I just cant keep this ones score so high. I think Rogues DIPA was marginally better.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

Deep copper-amber color,with an ever so slight hint of auburn.  White, creamy head is initially large and dense.  Recedes somewhat to one finger high, but is well-retained there and provides for much laing.  Bottle has sediment at the bottom, while the beer is lightly hazy.  Aroma of straight up citrus hops.  Adding to that you get crystally malt sweetness and just a bit of that hard, crystal malt dryness/breadiness.  Candied oranges and a fair dose of perfuminess.  Flavor begins with a ample but yet not-quite-overthetop amount of hops bitterness.  Its oranges, orange rinds, grapefruits and marmalade, but it dosent make you cringe (or dosent make me cringe anyways).  Soft, creamy toffee/caramel supports the hops nicely, while the mouthfeel is fluid and soft, the carbonation being gentle and only making itself known enough to assert that it is not loose or thin.  Medium body on the maltiness, surprisingly light, which brings me to my first problem;  its just not chewy and thick enough for me.  I really was expecting a thick, creamy, chewy malt monster with a huge hops flavor.  Sure its got the hops flavor, but unlike last summers version, this one backs off on the malt apparency (I sure loved last summers).  Finish is balanced and clean, with grapefruit and light spiciness, caramel and some dry earthiness.  A wonderfully-made, flawless beer, but I still prefer the maltier, chewier version.  8/5/8/4/15Summer 2006 bomber consumed on 10/5/06Still a wonderful appearance, great retention and lacing and all.Nose seems a bit more alcoholic/harsh than I recall, with LOTS of bitterness and more pine resin than remembered.  Still, its certainly lush, bold and aromatic.  Something lightly sourdough-like creeps in, as if crystal malt has an effect.The first half of the bottle proved rather harsh, heavy and somewhat overdone in bitterness and it was getting difficult to keep going, but then, somehow, the flavors began to come together and it began to get very enjoyable.  Fruitiness emerges, followed by a backing off of the pine and heavy grapefruit.  Some light malt sweetness helps soften things, while more alcohol actually seems to work beneficially in drying out the finish and taking some focus off of the heavy hop bitterness.  In the end, the fruitiness proves to save the day, though.  And the texture, which is always a strong point with AleSmith.  7/5/8/4/14","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The alcohol contect is there but not very noticeable until the end. Comparing with the last time I had this beer during the holidays until now, it has aged well.

Smell had citrus, graitfruit, vanilla, butterscotch and caramel.  There was a lot of pine in it too.  Taste was very hoppy yet smooth with graitfruit, citrus and caramel dominating it.  Very good but I would also the Three Floyds is slightly better.  Amazing stuff though.

Re-rate- Much better the second time.  I especially liked the orange at the end.  Overall an excellent Double IPA that ranks up with the best of them. 

Re-rate- 2006 bottle.  Cloudy copper body with a thick off white head.  Aroma is malty and hoppy at the same time with hints of graitfruit, citrus, caramel, currant, orange, and butterscotch.  Taste is so ultra with a good malts and hops balance.  There is actually hints of butterscotch in this beer.  Very citrusy as well.  I would have to try this against the Dreadnaught to get the official winner.  Very close.  Palate is perfection with a unique sweetness.  Just a magnificant beer all around.

Flavor is big on the hops (resinous pine and grassy earth) with plenty of bitterness to back up the minimally apparent alcohol and sweet, bready malt backbone.

Its like wandering through a pine and grapefruit forest right after the grass was cut.  The malt smells sweet behind it, but cant begin to keep up with the hops.  Pours a coppery orange with a white head that doesnt care to stick around too long, but does give a lot of nice lacing as it goes down.  Mouthfeel is full, but not as oily and syrupy as Id expected with the alcohol up where it is.  Flavor is initially puckeringly bitter with hops -- grapefruit, grass, pine, spice, and dirt from a beautiful American hop profile.

General citrus top notes with earthy and spicy undertones mixed with some malt and alcohol.  Citrus and resinous hop flavors--orange peel--with deep, strong, profound hop bitterness--one of the most bitter beers Ive had.

1184,"2005-04-02",4.9,"This highly regarded DIPA came to me via BA nvsblman.  The 22 oz. bomber had a painted label appropriate for the holiday season.  Opening the bottle and pouring it in the tulip was a joy to the senses, as the luscious burnt orange liquid slipped out of the bomber and produced a cascade of bubbles that erupted in a crowning, foamy, off white head.  The underlying beer was dense, and cloudy, and gave a good indication of the solid malt foundation that formed it.  The lacing was magnificently thick, as the head hung around for a while and kept coating the sides of the glass.

The hops assault on the nose began the moment the cap was popped, and bringing the glass to the nose unleashed more of it prior to each sip.  Lovely citric fruit peels, and spruce and pine resin were among the many forms that this hop aroma took.

The taste was very bitter up front, as the hop oils exploded in my mouth.  The malts were definitely there to back things up with their sweet caramelized, toasty, and faintly smoky self, but there was no mistaking about the mission of this beer.  It was to get as many hops into your mouth as possible without going over the top.  The hops were never overpowering as unpleasant, but instead kept the drinking session alive..  

The beer felt marvelously thick in my mouth, as the body was on the right side of medium.  The tongue coating body definitely let the hop residue sit on my tongue longer which left a lingering bitter-sweet aftertaste.  As it faded, the brain signaled that it was time for another sip, which is a testament to the awesome drinkability of this beer despite the strength and hop presence.  Speaking of strength, the 8.5% ABV hardly ever registered on the radar screen.  In the end I was bowled over by the deceptive charm of this hoppy beauty.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

It takes one sip and your hooked on this stuff. Just excellent.  Mouth feel is very round and full, sticky and totally mouth saturating.

When I take the time to write an exclamation in my tasting notes, especially at a place like the GABF where I could be jostled at any moment by beer-hungry passerby, and where I have a list of ""must-taste"" beers that make every moment precious, it means something.  The first thing I wrote about Yulesmith: ""dope!""  This was the freshest, crispest IPA Ive ever had.  Beautiful in the glass, orange luminescence with a perfect head: great lacing and long-lasting.  Taste was a perfect blend of peach, grapefruit and spice, which really came out on the dry yet refreshing finish.  This had great body, and a backbone of caramel malt that glided under all the wonderful fruit flavors and lasted all the way through the finish.  Wonderful.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Grapefruit citrus and piney hop aromas dominate at first.  Also a little perfumey, probably from alcohol.  Toasted bready malt balances hop as it warms.  Fruitiness seems to be all citrusy hop, and a little woody aroma comes in as well.   Balanced in flavor to bitter, but overall well balanced.  Lemony citrus hop flavor dominates with some caramel & toasty malt.  Some allcohol in the flavor, but adds to complexity.  Finish is on the semi dry side with a citrus hop and toasty malt that lasts into the aftertaste.  Medium body, warming alcohol, and lower carbonation; overall smooth.  Very enjoyable IPA.

It makes me think that someone squeezed a fresh hop cone(or two, or five) right into the bottle.  Finishes warm, with a slightly fruity note.

There is not an insane level of hops in the flavor, which is kind of a break in the style. As a matter of fact it might be the most well-rounded Double IPA I have tried.

This pours out a deep orange with a full off-white head. As the head gradually fades sheets of lace are left stick to the glass for the duration of this beer. Strong hoppy scent with floral and citric hops all over the place that only got stronger as this brew warmed. There was also a bit of sweet caramel that showed itself now and again when it managed to work its way through all that hoppy goodness. Starts off with a bitter citric hop tastes that blends with earthy hop notes and a piney flavor. Malt is present but only in a capacity to keep the hops from overrunning this beer. The after taste is a satisfying dry bitterness that leaves you craving the next sip. Mouthfeel is just about full with excellent carbonation and creaminess to it.

Hints of citrus (lemon lime, pineapple) floral notes and pine.  The flavor has a good deal of maltiness to keep it somewhat balanced, but still, thats a whole lotta hops.  It makes the sides of my jaw cringe at first, but does in fact leave my mouth with some warmth and robust malt flavor.  Such a good brew.---Summer 05 offering.  This was hyped as being a different brew, but falls into the same rating.  So from my previous description, yeah, I can definately notice a difference: Spicier.  Not like Jacobite or anything like that, it just comes off as being a bit more well rounded in that category.  RERATE on 8-4-2009 from a 09 bottle purchased at Rozis in Lakewood.  This one smells all sorts of pudry.  Rich malty character is overshadowed by a very nice citrus smell.  Lots of fancy star- and grape-fruit smells.

1184,"2004-11-18",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2013 Bottle from South Bay Drugs and Liquor: Immediate aroma filled with scents of freshly cut wood as if a woodshop tablesaw and piece of high quality wood were right in front of me being cut apart. Plus, there is a strong presence of bourbon whiskey and alcohol that is so pungent that it could possibly get me buzzed if I keep inhaling the fumes rising out the glass cup.  Appearance is to be expected with a pitch black dirty oil color with minimum amounts of fizzy head forming but then quickly dissolving back to jet black liquid. The flavor is intensely rich with black roasted malts along with sweetness reminiscent to vanilla bean while the bourbon whiskey becomes very apparent. Towards the finish, the alcohol is subtle and gentle only leaving behind a dry mouth and a residue of stickiness as well as an aftertastes of black licorice and wood.

Not much else to offer, but tasty all the same.  7/3/7/3/15  Re-rating: OSLO and Guerdes Memorial Weekend Tasting, 5/23/08.  Courtesy of Joebrew and BDR.  Hazy copper color with a thin head.  Strong orange and grass aroma.  Turns slightly into green tea in the flavor.  Very strong bitterness.  A light caramel malt to back it up.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

1184,"2004-10-28",4.2,"Winter 2003 bomber -   Ultra deep reds and ambers, thick creamy off-white head.  Crazy complex nose of pinesap, evergreen, fresh cut flowers, pineapple, some apricot, with just a hint of sweet caramel.  Very sharp pine and spruce hops attack on first sip, but as it warms I get some semblance of balance - not quite though.  I say screw balance!  Its overrated anyway.  Medium to full bodied, fizzy carbonation, sahara dry, bitter finish.  Thanks PZ!  Cant wait to get back my ass back to S. Cali one day.

1184,"2004-10-11",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 11, 2006 Deep hazy amber. Nicewhite head, a bit rocky that diminished as I drank the glass, but never fully vanished. Huge c-hops abundance. Lots of orange, flowers, grapefruit, pinneaple, and a hint of walnuts in the nose, wow, what a combo. Of course very hoppy palate, with the alcohol definitely detectable and an assertive bitterness. A nice malt profile backs it all. Well hidden 8.5%. Medium-thick body, creamy, smooth body. Terrific double red/IIPA.  The question remains...Can I fight off killing the remaining bottles too fast?  Probably not.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"

Golden reddish hue with an offwhite head.  Very thick hoppy aromatics with notes of pine forest and spice.

1184,"2004-10-04",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2005 Orange. 

Fine-tuned, but fairly subtle and disappointing nose (considering its Alesmith) of grapefruit, tangerines, orange, biscuits and caramel. 

Hefty, unorthodox, but succeeding attempt at the style, possessing a lot more acidity than most. Front is rich, citrusy notes of pine and spruce. Mid-palate comes through with hints of grapefruit, bark and vanilla. The finish is full of toffee,peanuts and hop oils. In all, the malt backbone is fairly sweet, possesing a lot of doughy notes but mainly a caramel sweetness. Unbelieveably balanced and simply stunning as it warms. 

Ill still be tasting this tomorrow. Just an incredible offering. I dont know what to say about Alesmith. Out of my current top 20 beers, 5 are from Alesmith. The best brewer I have ever come across at this point in my young life.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
1184,"2004-09-29",4.1,"Yulesmith is the last of the legendary Alesmith brews I have left from a recent purchase from Hi Times Wines in California and perhaps the best. It pours a nice red/amber color with a bit of white head and a smattering of lace. Nose is bright and citric with a touch of melon and pine. Full-bodied yet somehow still quite dry--would be absolutely perfect with just a hair more carbonation. An almost ice-tea-like maltiness backs up a strongly hoppy flavor profile with just a touch of alcohol in mild, lingiring bitter finish. Very nice. Very nice, indeed.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
1184,"2004-09-29",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 6, 2006 My first sip told me that this was disgusting hop juice.  The second sip said the same thing.  After the third and fourth sip the overwhelming alcohol kicked in and I didnt mind it so much.  I was actually able to finish this hop extract and so I wont destroy it in the ratings, but I dont know how everyone gives over hopped beers such high ratings.  It isnt good just because it has a shit-load of hops in it!!!   5/3/4/3/11 

RERATE: Mellon pour with a thin white film. Aroma is quite unique. Fruity and hoppy with just a touch of alcohol. Flavor is grapefruit, candy and resiny hops. Much better than I remember.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","shadey"

1184,"2004-09-08",4.0,"Summer 2004 bottling, courtesy jeffin7.  Orange-red, hazy body with a medium cream head.  Caramel and bread balanced by big pine and grapefruit hops with earthy notes thrown in for good measure.  Sampled this after trying the Dark Horse barleywine; this beer actually seemed tame in comparison, with dense caramely malts vying for dominance with abundant grapefruity, piney and earthy hops.  Smooth and creamy body.  Well-balanced.  A chewy, solid example of the style but certainly not amazing.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

Peeled off the red foil wrapping, like a present on Christmas morning, and Im ready to pop the cap...Appearance is murky, even violently carbonated at first, then settles to reveal a bright orange, topped with a thick, luscious layer of creamy, off-white froth. Looks very, very good!
Aroma: sweet and fruity, plenty of citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, peach, apricot, lemon, orange, and more, a bit of pine, too...awfully nice.
Taste....mmmm, mmmm, mmmm! Full mouthfeel, tangible, firm presence on the palate from the first sip, graps the senses from the lips and the tongue and the throat, and coats all areas with this great, citric, juicy hop flavor, just slaps it up and down, until no section is left unfelt by this feeling. Lush, majestic dominion over the mouth, perfectly dominates, and theres no denying, and I have to admire it, in fact, I outright adore it!
Every sip thereafter sends another wave of this delicious vibrant hoptastic taste washing over the tongue and every other inch of the cavern called the mouth, tart, yet still very fruity, and a touch sweet, though never considerably.Malt is solid and sure, and where hops are felt in full on the palate, the backbone is still considrable and adds much to the pleasure of the brew and to its ease of drinkability.
Wow.
This truly ranks in a class of its own.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

Beautiful pour, deep copper color and a long lasting creamy head.
Very smooth yet powerful aromas of hops and malt. Citrus, pine, fruit is all here but subdued and well blended.
Smooth mouthfeel and  just the right amount of body backed by a well balanced flavor combnation make this a top IIPA. A little less potent than a Ruination and not quite as assertive, but so well done this will surely be a favorite of a lot of folks. I wont argue the small stuff.

Aroma is, of course, very hoppy, but with a sweet malty undertone rarely detectable in this style.  Flavor is amazingly balanced, warm sweet malts give way to powerful citrusy hops.  This gives way to a moment of alcohol, an incredibly bitter and dry moment, and a long bitter floral dandelion finish.  This is what an IIPA should taste like!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sethdude"

A very bitter taste mixed in with some sharp orange peels, caramel, pine, lemons, and grapefruit. God the complexity of this IPA is just amazing. And the balance is perfect.

I might fall back off of that 19 to an 18 these days, and maybe drop that 10 in taste to a 9 - but that would be because there are so many outstanding beers being made these days that are readily available.

Is there a secret relationship between Alesmith and Stone that we dont know about??!  The pour was turbid dark straw with a big, creamy white head and lacing.  Aroma of fruit, hops, malt.
