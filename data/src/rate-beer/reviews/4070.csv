4070,"2017-06-05",3.9,"Pours clear light gold with a modest white head and a mildly sour aroma. There is a funky sour malt flavor that exhibits the benefits of blending different ages. Very much like a traditional lambic.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"

4070,"2017-02-19",3.1,"Bouteille 75cl, partagée avec la BXL tasting crew, merci Pierre T. Got zero reminder of the real thing.
Pâle très clair, une fois mi bouteille, un voile léger se fait présent, col fin blanc disparaissant rapidement.
Arôme au nez de pêche rappelant fortement un funk de brett plus qcq touche de cuir, le tout est un peu off avec en rétro encore de ce côté pêche fermentée.
Palais est suret persistant, sec avec un rappel de brett - pêche voire nectarine acidulé dominant sur fini citrique le tout laissant un mauvais picotement qui dure à chaque gorgée.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

Barnyard funk and aged hops indeed. Funky, moderately acidic and a little fruity. Good stuff.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
4070,"2017-01-24",3.9,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is fairly fruity with lots of stone fruit, tropical fruit and some much lighter citrus notes - peaches, apricots and plums with mango, melon and lighter pineapple. Some light barnyard funk and hay notes with a light herbal phenolic note. Hint of a cheesy note and some light oak. 
Pours a somewhat hazy, golden color with a small, thin, white head that recedes quickly and disappears. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor has a medium light acidity with faint citrus notes. Some faint grain and wheat notes as well. Light oak notes and very low bitterness. Less fruity than in the aroma but still quite a bit of stone fruit with some light mango and melon. The herbal phenolic note is a bit stronger and the hay and barnyard funk are light. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with low carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice American sour with some lambic qualities, but it still isnt there. For a lambic its too fruity and is missing that earthy not that makes lambic lambic; it has hints of it, but it isnt dominating. I like the low carbonation though and find this very drinkable.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
4070,"2016-11-20",4.2,"(En fût à la source): Mentholé, feuillu, boisé et très fruité; chair, peau et noyau de pêche moyennement grasse dans un liquide qui transparaître une belle maturité. Une minéralité flexible sert de colonne et appuie bien les céréales.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
4070,"2016-11-12",3.8,"Draught at Beachwood Blendery, Long Beach. Slightly hazy pale yellow/golden beer with a decent head. Tart fruity aroma, rubber, grapes, some earthy notes. Tart fruity flavor, grapefruit, rubber notes. Quite nice.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rlgk"
4070,"2016-10-22",3.8,"Deep yellow with a pale head. Aroma is funk, wood, citrus peel, cider vinegar, hint of apricot. Light bodied, tart and dry in the palate with a dry woody finish. Taste is oak, citrus peel, sour stone fruit, grape skin. Nice, one of the best US attempts at a lambic. Could amp up the dry acidity a little, perhaps by dropping the abv.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","GothGargoyle"
4070,"2016-10-22",4.2,"Taster at Funkendank. Pours a golden color with a bit of head. Crisp fruitiness stone fruit. Mild sourness with a lot of Bret funk.","California, USA","Bule"
4070,"2016-09-08",3.7,"Tart fruit aroma in a golden pour. Similarly tart fruity taste - but on a layer of bread. A very nicely balanced brew that makes an excellent sour.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beer-yum"
