Bit of a boozy nose for a 7% once the massive amounts of white froth clear and condense to a more yellowy layer. The colour is rich golden. The flavour is a little more subtle than expected from the smell, which is good, actually. The alcohol lends a stinging sensation which kind of detracts from but also adds to the experience at the same time. The flavour itself is a kind of cross between a particularly malty belgian tripel and a high quality kristall wheat beer. Toasty, caramel and banana and toffee notes with high sweetness which is balanced by the high carbonation and slightly sharp alcohol tinge.
