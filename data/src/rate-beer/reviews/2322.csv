Claer chestnut, reddish tinge, a soapy head.  Really a lot of oak in the nose, and some faint cherries.  Flacor was just a blast of brettonamyces, at first somehat off-putting but growing really delicious as the beer breathed.  A little undercarbonated for my taste.

2322,"2008-08-26",4.7,"In short: Some kind of very complex funky Flemish Sour on steroids.  Wicked and totally original
How: Hand-bottle drank with Dickinsonbeer.  Paul is my idol
The look: Cloudy redish-brown body topped by a small beige head
In long: Nose is funky, woody and tropical fruits.  From the nose I was already thrown off, just plain different.  Taste is out-there.  This one mixes lots of oak, medium sourness, wild bretty funkiness, cherries skin, spicy notes, almonds, refreshing tropical fruits and I could go on and on.  Take a La Folie, remove the heavier malt flavours (chocolate and such) and put a whole lot of funk instead and thats what you get.  Drank it and noted a mid-4 rating.  Then obsessed about it for a week even after drinking the entire Blind Tiger dry.  A unique experience.  Ill remember that beer until the day I die.  Or for another 2 years.  Whichever comes first.

2322,"2008-03-22",4.0,"12 oz handbottle, via Dickinsonbeer.  Pours a clear copper body under a one finger fizzy off-white head that receded to a foamy ring.  Light lazy carbonation.  The nose is really unique and complex.  Very bretty with some sweet amaretto like notes, cherry, light oak, and fruit stripes gum.  Very interesting.  Woah, very funky stuff.  Nothing like the regular Quad.  All the sugars have been devoured.  Fruity cherry up front, sweet malt, then the huge bretty funky sweaty feet finish shocks the heck outta ya.  No alcohol at all.  Late in the lingering finish I cant help but think of unbuttered popcorn.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with none of the stickiness if the regular Quad.  Perfect soft minimal carbonation, long lingering bretty funky finish.  Overall, this was just a really great experiment.

2322,"2008-03-19",3.8,"Cleveland tasting
The hits just kept on coming.  This time it was a once Top 50 beer that is solid but not deserving of the honor.  I dont know who brought it but thanks anyways.  The brett has not yet had time to really dry things out so the funk is not completely in place yet.  However it still packs a punch if you arent ready.
Aroma / Appearance - Peach schnapps, wet rubber tires and fruit loops are supported by a vague funkiness that indicates the brett still has some work to do.  The body providing all this fun is a transparent amber which struck me as a little on the faint side.
Flavor / Palate - Tartness smacks the tongue and smashes it with sour strawberries, caramel and chocolate graham crackers.  What this lacks in complexity compared to other quads it compensates with in sourness.  The dry vinuous finish highlights a fun experience.  While not quite a Top 50 beer this is an admirable experiment worthy of doing again.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
2322,"2008-03-18",3.4,"Steve is the man. Hooked it up with this rare beer. Pours a dark red. Head goes away quickly. Aroma is straight funk. Maybe a little oak. But this one is funked out. Flavor is funk, barnyard, and some grainy aspects. Sour fruit. A bit vinous.  A lot of booze. Somewhat sour. Im not sure. Brett is cool. Brett Michaels and George Brett are cooler. Im probably going to catch some shit for this, but it wasnt my favorite. Its complex, but it doesnt taste all that great.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"

A decent amount of wood in the aroma with a mix of darker fruits, breadiness, and a nice showing of the brett as well.  Flavor was a nice meld of the oak and dark sugars of a big belgian style quad...with a little bit of tartness coming from the brett (not as much as I was hoping for though).  Alcohol is not really noticeable, and overall a very solid brew.","Green, Ohio, USA","LeopoldStoch"
2322,"2008-03-14",4.0,"Hand-bottle from a Axilla.  Thanks a bunch, John!  Pours pretty still with a few bubbles but nothing close to what I would call a head. But from the picture here (which I assume is from the brewpub), it doesnt seem like it had much of a head to begin with.  Nose has lots of brett, oak, leather, plums, stinky cheese, sour cherries. A very pleasant smell--not too overwhelming in sourness, but not a letdown at all. Flavor is just weird.  Not really what I was expecting after the aroma. More dark fruits, cake, leather, lots of wood (oak), a bit of brett. Whats really strange is that in the aftertaste, I get all BMC. Very complex, but I wish it was tad more tart. Alcohol pretty well hidden overall. A pleasant sipper, no doubt.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

The brett reminds me of cable car, especially in the nose.  Cheesy, oaky, earthy, lots of ripe fruits, and dried fruits.  Layered flavors.  Leathery fruits that are a mixture of dried and ripe fruits, mostly cherries, apples and plums. Lots of oak, earthy, and cheesy flavors surround the fruits.  Dark candy sugar spices and brandy rise as it warms.  Finishes bone dry.  Really complex, and really amazing.  Whatever strain of yeast they used, is phenomenal.  More beers with this one please.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"
2322,"2008-03-12",4.2,"Thanks to Steve for sending a handbottle my way!  Poured translucent coppery orange with a wispy dusting of white head.. love the color of this!  The aroma picked up most of the things that are right with this world.. overripe plums, cheese, tart cherries, bourbon-laden oak, and vanilla for starters.. further probing brings about the faintest hint of lemon zest/vinegar and some sort of dark, aged spice that I cant pinpoint.  The flavor was nearly as intriguing and complex.. beginning with powdered cherry candy riding shaved oak and plums.. cherry brandy emerges on the middle giving a sweet, but not too sweet, sour, but not too sour impression.. more sour oak and vanilla notes round out the edges, and the cherry brandy stuck with me long after the finish, joining bone-dry leather and some cheesy funk.  Even though there was so much going on here, the balance was spot on.. dry and a little heavier-bodied on the palate.  Great stuff!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

2322,"2008-03-12",3.9,"Handbottle courtesy Hopdog - Thanks Steve!  Pours a deep brown color with the thinnest of heads, even with a moderately aggressive pour, but there is definitely some carbonation in this beer.  Aroma is relatively robust if you swirl the glass a bit...somewhat modest otherwise.  Nose is full of oak, sour cherries, and has some alcohol...almost bourbon-like.  Flavor is ridiculously complex...each sip is different from the last!  Honestly, the first sip was horrible...very bland and made me wonder what people were raving about (or if the handbottle had gone bad), but the drink seriously improved as I continued to savor.  Flavor varies between sour cherry, a cider-like astringency, dry blanket-like brett flavors, apples, bourbon, vinegar, and a high level of sweetness to keep everything in line and not allow the sour nature of the beer to take things too far.  The drink really evolves as some warming occurs...though I cant decide I like it more cold or as it approaches room temperature.  Palate is smooth and soft, and has a very dry finish not unlike a good red wine.  This is definitely a sipping beer in my book, as the 12 oz handbottle took me a good hour to finish, but I found myself sipping pretty continuously.  Not a beer to have on a regular basis, but a very good variation of the Quad style.","Valparaiso, Indiana, USA","valpoaj"

Thought Id go for a beer that is at least proximate to Baltimore to drink for a special occassion while watching the final episode of one of my favoire television shows of all time, The Wire.  Bottle popped with a little fizz, and some bubblyness, but mostly there was not much of any head.  Pours a really pretty brownish reddish orangish color.  Nose is very bretty with a nice sour kick and a lot of cherry fruit and other notes.  Taste is really very good and very different.  Im getting sour sure from the brett which  is there in spades, but also a bready quality, and a sweet slick vinegar vibe that comes from the sourness.  There is also a lot of oat bran and oattyness in this, and as much lilannie didnt like it, Im intrigued and it is really pretty nice and yummy.

2322,"2008-03-08",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2008 Poured from a 12 oz. handbottle, thanks to Steve.  Appearance is clear and amber red, not still but giving no head.  Aroma suggests adhesive and mango and cherry peels, very bretty and sour with apple, cherry, and pineapple fruitiness; not really funky at all, but thoroughly soured and distantly hot with a bit of dry spice that brings to mind poppyseed.  Flavor is full of bran and dried out cereals, very chewy and bready, feeling heavy with fiber and giving a really odd taste of glue that wraps around a serious sweetness of almond, black cherry and vanilla; an alcoholized pomegranate tartness in the mid palate.  The sourness here is soft, although it has the rich, balsamic earthiness of La Folie, however mostly in flavor rather than in feeling or effect; its musty and sweet, and more tart than sour.  Palate is smooth, lively, and generous.  Vanilla in the final, sweetened smack; a pleasant and truly interesting experience.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
2322,"2008-03-08",4.0,"HUGE thanks to stine for this one. What an odd beer. Definite brett presence on the nose, but asserts itself in a unique way.

Pours a nearly still looking amber/dark copper/brown  with ruby leaning into violet highlights around the edges. Flavor  has plenty of of cereal. Toasted almond. Not necessarily the meat, but rather the skin. The brett begins to take a more commanding role as  the beer opens releasing plenty of refreshing tartness.

2322,"2008-03-05",4.3,"Handbottle from Hopdog. This is one hell of a beer. Flavor has a fair bit of funk, but is big on the really chewy, oaky yeasts. There is a lot of complexity here but I dont feel like writing about it, I want to get to the good stuff. The flavor, at least to my mouth, has one of the craziest finishes Ive ever experienced in a beer. It tastes to me like a rich, salty, fruity, MSG. But lots of MSG. Almost dorito-like levels, but in a good way. Salty and lightly sweet, the sour fruits compliment it perfectly. It leaves this taste in your mouth like some bready chinese food. I love it. Somehow the oak bonded with the malts in such a way as to create this flavor. There is a ton of oak too, most of that sensation is probably due to it. Goes down real easy.

This beer has a ton of style, finesse, and uniqueness, and is very worthy of the praise its been getting. It would probably be even better with another year of souring, but aint no one ever gonna get to try that, so right now well have to settle for this fantastic brew. Thanks, Steve!","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
2322,"2008-03-05",4.2,"Much thanks to egajdzis for hooking it up...
Appears a deep amber with copper notes with a small, off-white head that quickly fades out into a mild cap. Tiny speckles of lacing are left around the glass.
Smell is of vanilla, caramel, red wine, nuts, oak, and just a touch of mild butterscotch.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas with some toastiness and caramel being backed up by vanilla and tartness.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, very drinkable, medium amount of tartness, light CO2, with zesty notes of puckering lemon, pumelo, citrus, & wine.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"
2322,"2008-03-03",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 11, 2008 Handbottle courtesy of jasonmech77 - After an aggressive pour, Im left with a deep copper colored beer that has a thin bubbly off white head.  The beer intially had some very light carbonation.  No real lacing to speak of.  Aroma is primarily tart fruit (cherries) and I guess the Bretts evreyone else has mentioned.  To be honest, I dont really know what Bretts smell like.  Flavor is basically the same as the aroma.  Tart and fruity.  Body is light to medium.  No lingering aftertaste.  A very interesting beer to say the least.  Im taking in account that this was a hand bottle sample.  Im sure it is probably much better from tap.  None the less, big thanks go out to Jason for sending this to me.","BFE, Arizona, USA","cbkschubert"
2322,"2008-03-03",4.1,"Pours a clear mahogany color, with a 1/4""  bubbly off white head. Aroma of tart fruit. Almost a wine  taste, flavor of cherries. A little alcohol feeling going down. Shared by cbkschubert. No lingering aftertaste.  Tartness on the palate.","Mescal Lakes (wherever that is), Arizona, USA","DoubleBubble"
2322,"2008-03-01",4.6,"Shared by Axilla. Thanks!!! Poured amber with very little head. Aroma hits me strong with the funk I love, with hints of cherries, vanilla, and a bit oaky.  Taste comes in with sour cherries, oak and brett funkiness otherwise known as ""feet"". Surprisingly well done and balanced. When I first heard of this, I really couldnt imagine what their quad with brett would turn out like. I only hope they can replicate this one. Really incredible.","Silver Spring, Pennsylvania, USA","Miver"
2322,"2008-03-01",4.2,"Sampled this from a 12 oz handbottle-via Dickinsonbeer!  Amber in color with a very small off white head.  Aroma:  Sour cherries, toasted almonds, tart lemon rind, light vanilla and oak, and touches of caramel malts.  Taste is nice and tart with sour cherries, tropical fruit, oak.  The brett ate through pretty much all the malt on this beer, but it still has a nice body, just because of the amount of alcohol in it, which is well hidden.  Finishes with tart cherry, lemon rind, and a good deal of oak. Thanks Paul, this is one I needed to try!","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
2322,"2008-02-29",4.4,"Handbottle (via Spacecoyote). Pours amber-brown with a small, off-white head. Wild, fairly complex aroma, with nice interplay between toffee, leather, walnuts, dried fruits, wild yeast, and vinous notes. As it warms, the barnyardy aromas become more apparent. Flavor begins with dark fruit, which is joined by oak, tannins, vanilla, green apple, and brett. Finishes is nutty, with oak, vanilla wild yeast and some pepper. Ive been very impressed with some Iron Hill brews this past year (namely Heywood and F.red) but this blows them away. Congrats to the Iron Hill crew on an tremendous beer.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"
2322,"2008-02-28",4.3,"First of all, let me start out by saying I dont particularly care for brett beers. That being said, I stopped by Iron Hill to try this brew because It was something new from them. When I got there Dickinsonbeer and Whaleman were running through the beerlist like hot knives through butter, so I had to order quickly. Pours a clear orange color with lacing type head. The aroma was strong with brett, wood,yeast, and sour funk. The taste was a pleasant surprise. Add a little vanilla and some light dark fruit to the aroma notes and you have a very solid beer that dances on your palate. Very elegant high class beer. Well done.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","Ty5592"
2322,"2008-02-27",4.4,"Served in a tall flute at Iron Hill North Wales. I drank two of them. Clear tea-colored amber body with light carbonation and a silky ivory head.  Strong vinous and wild yeast aromas with distinct cherry tones.  Flavor has lots of dried fruits, nice soft vanillins and tannins, well-attenuated malts, and considerable tartness.  Strong impressions of a Flanders Red with characters of apple cider vinegar and leather.  Fairly thin texture, but super smooth and ridiculously easy to drink.  This is like tart, Bretty tea.  Tons of flavor, but very little perception of alcohol.  Outstanding beer.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
2322,"2008-02-26",4.6,"#1100!  Hadnt planned on doing this with a local beer, but this came along at the right time and is really something special - way to go Iron Hill.  Draft at IH North Wales and growler at home.  Nice reddish amber color with an off white head.  Aroma is a fantastic sour-bretty mix of citrus, wood, grape, cherry, funk, and stocked wine cellar (with spillage nearby).  Flavor has a nice sour-bretty bite with a pleasant dose of wood and light bourbon.  Getting some lemon, apple, barnyardey/vinous-grape, sour/tart cherries, vanilla, caramelly sugar, and more Brett.  Really nice mouthfeel - somewhat reminiscent of Cuvee de Tomme but with less alcohol taste (I tried the CDT that had heavy bourbon influence).  A really nice balance of sweet/sour/funk.  Wow - best Iron Hill beer by far.  Please re-make this and bottle some - I would have no problem paying $20+ a bottle for this.  Amazing!","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
2322,"2008-02-26",4.5,"Pours a somewhat hazy amber/orange color with a very small white lace.  Somewhat vineous nose with notes of dry red wine, wild yeast, cherries, and oak.  Flavors Start off with a smooth cherry taste with some vanilla, citrus,  carmel, and sugar also present followed by a mild funkiness and a nice tartness that complements the other flavors without taking over.","New Providence, Pennsylvania, USA","axilla"
2322,"2008-02-26",4.2,"Tap at North Wales today.  Pours a clear coppery woody amber with a nice lasting tight white head and some great lace.  Aroma is upfront with some red wine and woody brett with some wierd tannic- cherry pit almond like astringency- some sourness- and wierd tropical fruitiness from possibly brett bruxx.    Flavor has a ton o ffunk and brett, nice tannic red wine oakiness with a sharp tart sour finish- some light fruitness in the middle, with some light pineapple.  The thick caramel sweetness and maltiness of this beer has completely gone and has been eaten by brett- must have been a while in the barrel to eat all that.  Nice tart and woody astringetn finish which is very pleasant.  this was actually a bit better than I expected based on the original version.  Looking at some other reviews- I can also see this being similar to Cuvee de Tomme.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
2322,"2008-02-26",4.2,"On tap at North Wales.  Hazy copper brown with a slim, frothy white head.  Lacy strands.  Nose is lightly sour, oaky, with hints of cherry and caramel.  Prominent funk as it warms.  Medium light with soft carb.  Taste is toffee and cherry pits with lingering citrus pith and peel smoothed by oak and touches of vanilla.  Taffy aftertaste.  A wonderfully inspired brew.  More a Sour now than a Quad.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
2322,"2008-02-25",4.7,"Rating #1300. On tap at North Wales. Man, oh man! I was excited when I read the reviews on this because they came from reliable sources. I was debating all day whether I should make the drive out to the brewery or not. I called there around 3 and the bartender said they didnt have that much left but the beer wasnt selling as well as their other ones. I guess the world is not ready yet for brett. Got there around 5 to find the place filled with a few people. Sat down at the bar and ordered one. Nice hazy golden red body with very thin head. The aroma of brett, vanilla, wood, oak. The aroma really didnt kick in until near the end. Flavor of oak, vanilla, brett, funk, light yeast, dark fruits. Mouthfeel has that feeling of a warm spring rain shower filling your lungs. I can drink this one everyday, no lie. I was looking forward to logging in after I drank this to find out what the alcohol% was because I could not taste it at all. So quaffable and dangerous. The sour funk is so smooth. Each key taste noted is perfectly balanced with each other which is really nice that the oak and brett arent fighting it out to be dominant on my tastebuds. Well done Iron Hill.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","jason"
2322,"2008-02-24",4.7,"Poured a lightly hazy reddish brown color with a small, off white head that left light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of red wine, brett, leather, vanilla, oak, and Belgian funk.  Taste of brett, more red wine, some roast, oak, vanilla, cherries, dark candi sugar, and a bit of alcohol with a lengthy sour finish.  In a way reminded me of Cuvee de Tomme, while I sat there, and drank a ton of this shit today.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
2322,"2008-02-23",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2008 On tap at the North Wales location during the War of the Worts homebrew competition.  Pours a mostly translucent brownish amber with little to no head.  Aroma of oak, vanilla, cherries, floral, dark candy sugar, brett, is there but light a nice compliment.  Flavor of bourbon, vanilla, oak, cherries, dark fruits, alcohol is toned down, still getting some of the Belgian yeast esters and candy sugar from the Quad. Funky/tart brett notes which is not over the top but compliments this beer very nicely.  The barrel and brett have taken over this Quad but have turned it into one heck of a beer.  Re-tasted from a growler...adjusted aroma by one point and overall by one.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
