4569,"2017-05-08",4.0,"Parece un cruce entre Witbier y Saison. Color amarillo pajizo, con reflejos dorados, turbio, con capa de espuma de dos dedos de grosor (retención decente). Carbonatación alta. Textura acuosa y algo efervescente. El aroma es un tanto unidimensional, con la salvia un poco más remarcada de lo que debería. También se puede captar lima, pan y algo de plátano. En boca es super refrescante y afrutada (lima, naranja), con presencia, de nuevo, del trigo (toque de pan, plátano menos presente) y final floral, herbal y especiado (mucha salvia).

4569,"2017-04-24",2.8,"This is a beer that would benefit heavily from scaling the hops back by at least half. Tropical hop notes dominate the flavor to the point where anything else struggles to get through at all.

4569,"2016-07-19",4.1,"Over the ages the term cellar door has numerously been referred to as the most beautiful term in the English language. Upon setting out to create the first summer addition to the Stateside line up of ales; the feeling that almost instantly came to me was that of beauty & cleansing. Many summer offerings tend to lack the complexity of their bigger, colder season counterparts; so my goal was to craft an ale of extreme balance with a delicate complexity that allows for contemplation while also providing quaffable refreshment. Starting with a base of German wheat & pale malts this crisp slightly hazy foundation was then accented with a blend of Sterling & Citra hops providing a intricate blend of herbal grass & tangerine citrus flavors and aroma. To pull this all together and to complete the cleansing aspect of my vision I gently finished the ale off with a touch of white sage, lending a mild earthy spice character to the blend. Of course lets not forget our house saison yeast that brought all the elements together leaving a dry yet intricate finish.","barcelona, SPAIN","llucmaduell"

The smell started off with some nice sweet bready malts opening up into sweet citrus and then some light earthy sweet tones. Semi-grassy sweetness with herbal qualities balancing nicely.
The taste was mainly herbally sweet with a nice light citrus to balance in the flavor. Breadiness clings in the aftertaste with a running sweet finish.

The nose shows mostly honey, herbs, and some slight hints of citrus fruits with the distinct barnyard/farmhouse aroma. 

The palate is medium bodied. The first impressions shows mostly spices and herbs along with the bitterness that follows for some of those herbs (not from the hops). The farmyard flavor tends play a role in the background of these spices. The finish shows very faint hints of malts but the mid-palate shows a spiciness that tends to last too long afterwards. Not many fruit flavors just a lot of the spices and herbs that take center stage making it somewhat difficult to approach.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

4569,"2014-06-26",3.9,"The quaint, bucolic origin story of the French farm saison I know, but the lore (or myth) behind the idea of an American farmhouse ale is something alien to me, even with my American citizenship. Still, wherever this beer come from, and however it was inspired, this is a wonderfully dry beverage for summer drinking. Much more exotic indeed, its not an IPA. The heavy, wet straw color hints at a rich cornucopia of grains, with a thin fizzy headed that quickly floats away, and a haziness that comes partly from a cold serving temperature. White grapes, straw and basil compose a sophisticated, dry aroma, with other botanical touches including fennel seed. And the taste is a suitable match. Theres much less white grape flavor here until somewhere near the aftertaste. Instead, the palate is focused on a wonderfully balanced blend of wheat notes, a touch of dry lemon peel or even lemon verbena, some lemon grass, more thyme, and even a touch of white pepper in the finish. As always, these styles of beers are hard for me to wrap my ahead around, but I like them. The better that medley of tastes and grains - the closer to some idealized aroma of a fresh harvest - the more enjoyable these brews get, and this counts high among their number.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

4569,"2014-06-12",4.0,"Pours a cloudy light golden, with a fine white head. Nose is yeasty, slighty barnyardy, grass, I get some of the citrus in citra, banana, slightly spicy. Flavor is banana, spice, yeasty, a little orange, with a dry and spicy finish. Really great. My description doesnt do it justice, but the flavors in this are really cohesive, and more complex than Im describing. Not only that, but its more of a continuum of flavors, because theyre just blended so well. Standard carbonation with a medium body. Really excellent.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Niksko"

identical to aroma. Mid-bodied. Mild, mealy, flattish
mouthfeel. Dryish mealy wooden white sage aftertaste with spicy
fruity notes. Nice, drinkable, unusual and really showcases the
white sage (which is really recognizable from Nøgne Øs Special

The taste is lemony, a little funk, sage and other spices, creamy. I had Stone saison just before this, (although they are different styles the spices and taste made them very similar in my opinion) I hate to admit that i was a little disappointed in that beer, and was assuming this one was going to be a masterpiece compared, instead this does have the edge, but was a little disappointed in this one as well. Very nice beer, I just wish they would cut back on the spices a bit.","Idaho, USA","Beerdrinker79"

Good amount of earthy spice/bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, pear, apple, pepper, sage, grass, herbal, wheat, cracker, light bubblegum and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of hop, yeast ester, and spice flavors; with a great yeast/spice flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome spiced saison style. All around great complexity and balance of hops, yeast ester, and spice flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink.

Lemon grass and I guess, that Sage are giving me big time citrusy bitterness and an earthy ""feel"" that I think is quite unusual but very tasty. It ends on the decidedly dry and still very bitter side. Yummy. Medium bodied with perhaps a tad too much carbonation but thats a minor quibble.

This surprised me, though the ratings are on the good to very good side on average. The surprising thing? Today is April 5, 2014. This bottle has a bottling date of April 23, 2013. Wow, that is nothing short of amazing!","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"

4569,"2014-01-21",4.1,"Maybe a mistake to pour vigorously into a pilsner glass, because the head is off the charts. Very good lace though. Very hazy yellow, lots of specks suspended in the amber.

The funk in the nose is great, true barnyard stuff. There is a lemony sourness there. Just a touch of banana wheat. The sourness is not unlike a gueuze.

Combination of sourness and grassy hops. The lemon/citrus cuts through the sourness and gives it a needed counterbalance. When its cold, its actually rather refreshing. Hint of cut ginger. Has an earthy quality as it warms up a bit.

Thick feel, surprisingly little carbonation, but a smoothness. The thin glass keeps the carbonation really well, so it starts to scrub the ol tongue a little bit. (Necessary after some kettle corn.) Also, it starts clearing the nostrils a bit. Farmhouses are not my favorite style, but the complexity of this one made me a believer.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"
4569,"2014-01-21",3.9,"Bottled 6/7/13 at Two Roads Brewing (site has listed under Pub Dog), drunk on 1/21/14Clear, light peach-apricot colored body has a large white head that rapidly recedes and shows moderate to low retention (from the sage, no doubt).Fresh, authentic sage in the nose is quite dominant, but so bright and enjoyable that it dosent seem to matter that it takes front stage. Light yeast notes (cobweb, basement, rhubarb) linger in the background and a touch of acidity in the form of tangerine/grapefruit is left on the end. A hint of alcohol warmth and some light maltiness (honey, dough) emerge more with warming and the sage falls off a touch, allowing more yeastiness. Medium-high strength of aroma and very nicely lingering.Malt and sage collide and are wedded perfectly, up front. Sweet, but from a wonderful depth of malt, leaving honey, baked gooey brown bread and creamy wheat on the palate to be balaned perfectly by the sage and light hop bitterness. A very light astringency is felt, from the sage, on the finish as well, but its all easily balanced by the maltiness. More basement-like yeast flavors emerge, as seems pretty standard for his beers. It gives a wonderfully rustic character and while the rest of the beer is very cleanly and elegantly done, it gives it its own distinct charm. Medium bodied, with a soft texture from the wheat and engaging, tight carbonation. Absolutely LOVE the maltiness. I drank this much faster than Ive drank most dry session ales lately, unintentionally. It just works that well. Its good to see an American brewer that can do a sweeter, spiced Belgian ale. Not too many can.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

4569,"2013-08-27",3.6,"The beer pours a golden orange color, like a deep, dark piss. The beer forms a light head of pale white bubbles that quickly fizzle away to a thin, almost-non-existent scrim on the sides of the glass. In body, the beer is clean but murky, with just faint suggestions light and shapes coming through from the other side of the glass. Upon further examination, tiny specs can be seen floating in the beer, though none are of a considerable size. On the nose, the beer smells smoothly funky with saison yeast and a good touch of pepper that spices the nose. Pineapple and a touch of orange juice can also be sensed on the nose, along with a nice, light wheat flake scent that suggests the beers malt. The pineapple smell blends in and out of the funk smell, suggesting a presence of juicier hops and some nice, hay-like funk. On the tongue, the beer tastes fruity sweet and acidic with a light, tart pucker to the mouth and a very light touch of bitterness, which comes through more in the aftertaste. In flavor, the beer begins as light wheat malt, immediately exploding into huge pineapple bursts of flavor with herbal, funky side flavors and a light bitter grapefruit. The funk is deep enough that I think I detect some brett in the flavor, though I didnt think this beer had any in it The finish is dry, yet full of pineapple funk flavors and just a touch of wheat malt, which the aftertaste accentuates. In the mouth, the beer feels sharp in carbonation, coming in somewhere on the heavy side of medium, while the body sits on the tongue comfortably at a medium weight. The mouth is left dry except for acid cancelling saliva on the sides of the cheeks and a light stickiness on the tongue. Overall, this is a nice little saison with some rich complexity. It is delicate and very fruity with its funk, most likely due to the addition of white sage. Its not my favorite American Farmhouse Ale though. Its good and tasty and I would never turn it down, but it doesnt seem like the type of beer I would drink more than one of at a sitting, as it sits in the stomach a little heavy. Its rich and complex, but it doesnt light up my palate like it has for others.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

4569,"2013-06-30",4.0,"750ml bottle into a New Belgium tulip. From old-ass notes.

A: Pours a hazy straw color. Theres about one fingers worth of creamy, white-colored head, as well. Lacing is really beautiful.

S: This is very sage-forward. Buried underneath that note is a solid undercurrent of orange peel. I wouldnt really consider it complex, but it sure is evocative the way the aroma balances itself between these two notes.

T: The opening flavors are quite spicy, with additional notes of coriander to go along with all of that white sage. Further sips help to accentuate a wonderful tone of orange peel, also. Theres also a bit more complexity than the aroma suggested (subtle notes of apricot, cream, and wheat show up). This brew is really about the excellent sage and citrus peel character, however.

M: Initial heftiness is a tad much, however the finish helps to alleviate this with its crisp, clean finish. Carbonation is high, par for the style.

O: Subjectively, saisons are pretty hit-and-miss for me. Id easily call this a hit though, thanks to its balance between drinkability and good (but not great) complexity.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

This was found during a cellar cleaning as I begin to figure out how to whittle all the old things out of hidden boxes. It turned out to be fairly solid. Stillwater may not be my favorite brewery but I can think of few times they have been too expensive or too off the mark.

Aroma / Appearance - The golden yellow base resembles a crisp sparkling cider. The gushing head rushes and gets so thick that it takes minutes to settle down. Lemon, citrus, and hay smell like a hopped up version of 7UP.

Flavor / Palate - Hay and lemons freshen up a parched palate. Bubbly 7UP tickles the tongue before it carries into a light hoppy finish. Pleasant and drinkable my only complaint is that it feels a bit too carbonated. Otherwise this is a safe beer to try if you know you have a reasonably fresh bottle.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Finishes dry, with hops finally making an appearance toward the end. This still isnt my favorite style, but this is a very nice brew. Very delicate.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

Great flavor that by no surprise from the aroma showcases the citrus.  Light bubblegum is also noticeable but the orange and lemon notes steal the show.  This does not stray too far from what a standard witbier normally tastes like but it does set the bar high.

4569,"2011-07-26",4.0,"A steady pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a prodigious, four-finger thick, pale head that forms an interesting, varied head as it slowly subsides as well as leaving lots of lacing on the sides of my glass.  The beer is a hazy, honey-amber color that shows a deeply hazed, orange, straw color when held up to the light.  The aroma has an earthy back note of Dupont-yeast like spiciness and I think the sage comes in here as well.  Up front the beer has a citrus character as well as a fruity, almost tropical fruit character that perhaps reminds me a bit of juicy fruit bubblegum character; it is interesting that the hop fruit character really melds with the rustic spiciness and it transforms the hop character to be something completely different than one would find in a cleaner IPA.  Specific aromatic notes of Meyer Lemon, lychee, candied lime, woody sage, a musty woodiness, a touch of phenolics that isnt quite medicinal or plastic like.  I like the juicy hop character here, it really works with the hint of sage and rustic yeast aromatics.

The beer is quite dry tasting, and nicely light bodied; the body still has a touch of viscous character, just enough to keep this from being watery.  There is quite a bit of zippy carbonation, though it is not on the high side for a Saison.  The beer has quite a bit of up front hoppiness that has flavors of lychee, super ripe tangelo, Meyer Lemon, and Curacao orange zest.  This up front character is not quite dominant, there is a strong, woody sage note and a touch of bitterness in the finish, and a deep earthy spiciness and yeast phenolic character towards the finish.  The sage is actually perhaps the most dominant character in the flavor, but it couples quite prominently with a spicy, peppery fermentation character.  The finish really has a sharpness and bite to it, this seems to be a combination of the hop character, the sage and the fermentation character.  The hops and fermentation spiciness combine to form a sort of Japanese, pickled ginger character, as well as a spicy herbal character.  There is an earthy, yeast character here that seems to suggest that quite a bit of the haze in this beer is due to yeast (I really didnt give this any time to settle), but this is certainly not a bad thing and adds to the rusticity.

This is quite a nice Saison, it is certainly a bit rough around the edges, but that just adds to the character.  The balance towards rough is caused by the ample hop character that I am quite enjoying, so I definitely wouldnt want the hops to be reduced in order to make this softer / rounder.  This is definitely my type of Americanized Saison.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Nose is saison yeast (which reminds me a lot of champagne yeast) grapes and citric hints. Taste is pale malts, citric tones, hay, chalk, sour grapes and a slight grassy touch.

4569,"2011-04-04",4.1,"bottle thanks to mansquito.  Pours cloudy orange gold, with big, fluffy off white head.  From the looks and first whiff it is already enjoyable.  Aroma is bright and fresh, with plenty of spicy notes, soft rosemary, sage, which with the yeast presence lends a subtle tartness, also very floral.  Incredibly smooth, rich mouthfeel, which is abruptly finished with little bit of sweet fruitiness, on to a lingering spiciness.  Flavor is very complex, but somehow manages to also be refreshing.  There are sweet fruity notes, an undercurrent of tart yeast, plenty of flowery spices which add both sweet and subtly bitter aspects.  This saison is big in flavor as is typical of american versions but also is very nuanced and delicate like belgian renditions tend to be.  Ultimately it is one of the better saisons Ive had, and is one of those which remind me the potential depth and possibilities for this style.

4569,"2011-03-07",2.8,"Poured into a tulip. Thanks to onedropsoup for this.

4.5 A: Lightly hazed light orange color. Three fingers of pillowy white head with very good retention and plenty of lacing too.

3.5 S: Plenty of herbalness in here and somewhat flowery. Cilantro, lemongrass, and basil come through. Lemony fruitiness. Almost overbearingly musky, but it needs a brett component to make it fit in. Hops are grassy and somewhat citrusy. Overall, really dry. Theres no doubt this is complex, it just doesnt come together all that well.

3.0 T: Like the nose, this is super dry - dry even for a saison. The main flavor is a dusty muskiness. Theres some pepper spiciness and a touch of herbalness again, but no flavors even approach the musk. Lightly lemony. Not nearly as complex as the nose and not particularly tasty either.

3.0 M: Light body. Carbonation is a bit higher than desirable and a bit bity as well. Could definitely be creamier as well.

2.5 D: I dont understand how the Stillwater saisons got hyped. This and Stateside are both pretty mediocre. Not really anything good about this other than the appearance.

I didnt notice the sage right off the bat, but with enough effort you can find it. I noticed something akin to lemongrass in there, but reading the description that might be from the combination of hops. The taste is very smooth (and unfortunately, I got mine in a really small glass, so there wasnt that much to relish), with sufficient hops to give this beer and American character, but still maintain the lightness of the saison style.

Crisp and lively body, nicely prickly dry finish. Taste of citrus (faint grapefruit rind) and grain, very earthy core to the beer, and I wanted just a bit more spice for contrast (funny to read that others found it too much). Definitely a fine saison though.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

A nice, crisp and flavorful golden saison.  Not tart, or even funky like a lot of saisons.  Vibrant carbonation.  Flavor is slightly grainy sweetness with some spice notes and a good dose of citrus hoppiness without a bitter edge.  Im very, very impressed by how drinkable this beer is.

Pours a slightly yellowed carrot orange. Its mostly translucent, with evidence of high carbonation (lots of bubbling activity). A three finger white head recedes to a nice, sticky one finger rim. Some of the lacing sticks in place for the entirety of the pour. 

Lots of citrus and lemon peel, along with a tiny bit of banana esters. As it warms, a good bit of herbal spiciness comes through, probably from the white sage. Tropical, floral; soft and pleasant. Taste is perfumy, with notes of white pepper and some citrus. Theres some breadiness, but the minty sage really comes through mid-to-late palate.

Dry and effervescent. Surprisingly creamy despite the fairly high carbonation. 

The soft and balanced nose is the best part of this beer, but overall its a nice farmhouse ale - nice blend of perfumy, phenolic spicy, and citrusy elements. Would probably be a very nice beer in the heat of summer.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

The spicy sage doesnt try to hide, here--coupled with some citrus hops and moderate wheat, farmhouse saison yeast in the backend with some cracker malt.  Not getting much sweetness so far.  Flavor has stronger herbal leafy sage up front in the aroma, and takes away from the hoppy notes.  The yeast is still present, but really--whered the hops go?  Still spicy with some cracker malt, still minimal sweetness.  Bone dry spicy finish, bitterness peaked at a 2-3.  High carbonation with a light to medium body.  Not bad, but was hoping for more with the Sterling and Citra--couldve done without the sage.  Not that the sage was bad, I just dont think it added much in the overall complexity, and was just a tad too heavy-handed in the flavor.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

Hard pour into my tulip brings a five-finger head that eventually recedes down into a fairly constant single-finger layer, although it only leaves the tiniest bit of lacing behind. Nose brings forth a tiny amount of earth and hay along with a nice lemon presence. A little bit hoppy. Taste is quite the same with a bit of lemony grass and some slight bitterness. Mouthfeel is quite light and a bit undercarbonated. Drinks pretty well but is lacking the type of depth I expect for saisons.

4569,"2010-12-01",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2012 My Bottom Line:
Wheat and perfumy citrusy hops contribute a lot of freshness to this bubbly Saison, until a symbiosis of sage and herbal, spicy hop bitterness settles in on the tongue.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A lot of foam is produced early on, but cannot seem to leave lacing atop the misty golden.
-Mouthfeel is quite dry and effervescent. Could be a tad softer for my tastes.
-The chosen hops and herbs are perfectly harmonious and thus hard to dissociate.
-Cant wait to try more from this new brewery!

Aroma - Was very complex.  With an earthy smell, musty wood, hay, and subtle hints of sage and citrus.  Maybe the name tainted me, but it really smelled like I opened the door to a root cellar and was walking in.

Appearance - Pale amber with a hazy appearance.  Thick frothy head just a tad off-white.  Very pretty pour.  Significant lacing and head retention

Taste - Surprising light and crisp.  The aromas while strong did not taint the flavors.  A lot of citrus, grass, and sage.  All flavors present were very subtle, and yet stirring.

Palate - Light and thing, with lively and fine carbonation.  Felt somewhere between pop rocks and champagne on the tongue.  Very dry as well.  If I didnt know better I would have thought it was a dry champagne.

Overall - This was something that is a must have.  Each category of tasting is very pronounced and different.  And while everything is pronounced it retains a certain subtlety that is hard to match.

4569,"2010-11-07",4.2,"750ml bottle.  Carefully poured, with much anticipation, the liquid turns up a cloudy, glowing, bright orange-amber color, strewn with tiny streams of effervescing bubbles.  Fed from below, a tall, billowing head of smooth, off-white foam is very well retained, slowly reducing down to a staunch blanket with pronounced edging, where it remains for the duration of the drink.  Tall flares of hard drying lace branch out horizontally, resembling the profile of a long-branched live oak tree.  Its simply a stunning looker overall.The aroma is gorgeous, displaying a excellent balance between fresh, lightly sweet wheat grain, doughy pils malt, drier grass, and perfumy floral hop character.  Theres a unique fruitiness to the yeast, suggesting notes of pineapple and pear, as spicy, dried citrus peel and clean, almost minty sage brighten things up considerably.  The floral character is impressive, yet subtle.  Its almost like being down wind of a mixed wildflower patch.  Dry, bright, crisp, and complex, with just a touch of clean grain sweetness, theres nothing bad I can say about the nose.  It simply smells awesome, and it has my mouth watering in short order.The taste is just as impressive.  The clean, herbacious sage really stands out, cutting right through the candied wheat malt and doughy, fruity yeast.  Dehydrated pineapple and pear work with candied tangerine rind to lend a bright, concentrated fruitiness.  Floral hops are dry, lightly bitter, and softly peppery, keeping things well balanced.  Its just a damn tasty beer.The palate is appropriately moderate in body, sporting a relatively dry consistency with a lively effervescence that tickles the tongue.  Theres a bit of creaminess to the mouthfeel, giving an almost ""whipped"" or aerated sort of sensation.  Those delicious spices are concentrated on the long, clean finish.  Excellent stuff!Overall, this second encounter with Stillwater product (the first was Stateside Saison) confirms that Brian is one of the best up and coming American brewers on the scene.

4569,"2010-09-26",4.1,"Bottle: Pours a hazy bronze amber with a pillowy froth of clumpy-lacing white head.  Has a lightly sweet biscuity malty nose with a big floral lavender and citrusy hop presence.  Starts with pretty good fullness and finely-dissolved carbonation with a light malty sweetness and some light fruity esters well-balanced with a citrusy herbal hop character and a touch of sage spice before a drier crisp finish.  A very nice saison that pairs well with food, but is capable of standing on its own.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

4569,"2010-09-21",3.9,"On tap, Hawthornes.  Pours a cloudy orangish gold with a small fizzy white head, lots of visible carbonation.  The nose is herbal and spicy with a great yeast profile.  Theres some moderate hopping in there, but second fiddle to the yeast and herbal character.  The flavor is really soft and showing a good deal of complexity without being overly complicated with too much in your face spicing.  Herbal, floral, spicy, nicely dry with just the right yeastiness.  Medium bodied with frothy fizzy carbonation.  The herbs linger long and hard.  Pretty nice, not a huge Saison fan in general, but this was unique and enjoyable.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Ill recite some aromas, sure, then Ill name a bunch of flavors, but that wont really paint a picture of how much I enjoyed this stuff. Flowery, citrusy, herbal - see? totally inadequate. How sage and rosemary? yeah thats in there too. Should I mentione a woodsy, oaky note, too? Like I said, just a list of flavors doesnt do it justice. Awesome stuff.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"

Great summer beer.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","italarican"
4569,"2010-08-22",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 24, 2010 Very good saison.  The yeast notes seemed a bit dominant only because I would have liked to taste the hops a touch more.  That might have to do with the age of the keg.  The herbs were a nice touch; the sage stuck out well without pushing forward too much.  Stillwaters saison yeast is quite good, dry with a mild barnyard note.  The hops were citric but much more subtle than in the Stateside Saison, which I prefer.  The beer poured hazy and light gold with a white head.  The feel was appropriate for the style, not too much carbonation and fuller than the abv would suggest.  The carbonation is gentle but feels like lots of small bubbles, if that makes sense.  Anyway, I look forward to trying more beers from Stillwater.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

4569,"2010-07-12",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2010 Rerate, from draft and bottle. For whatever reason, the carbonation on my second visit with this beer was way more tuned in. Changed the spicing and the mouthfeel a fair bit; dug it even more this time.

Draft @ Maxs. Pours a lightly hazy, bright yellow color; small-bubbled white head with light retention and solid lacing. Huge presence of fresh sage in the aroma: nicely floral and herbal, with a slightly honeyed, slightly quiet malt core: the sage is softly integrated and very freshly presented, but its the dominant note here and it honestly reminds me of my toothpaste; strongly, appropriately, herbal. Medium to medium-full body; average levels of carbonation; in the mouth, the sage character steps back a bit, letting the honeyed malts (light) and peppery yeast character show through more prominently; the core is reasonably balanced (not especially dry); meaty saison-like / wheat core, with lots of white pepper coupled to the herbal qualities of the sage; tasty stuff, if a touch sharp. Lengthy finish, showing lots of pepper, lingering sage, and a much drier ending than the core suggests; some solid mineral bitterness plays out as well; all told, a bit too much spicing for my palate. 7.4.7.4.14=3.6","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
