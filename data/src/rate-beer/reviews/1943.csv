1943,"2017-05-30",4.0,"Many thanks to Greg for this brew! Robe noire dencre et au volume moyen. Le liquide semble couler légèrement dans mon verre et y forme une majestueuse mousse claire et dense. Arômes de malts chauffés sans fumée, de frits rouges et de houblons verts. Cest à la fois très léger et naturel. Des feuilles de houblon européen flottant à la surface dun café corsé. Liquide assez mince où le houblon apporte légèreté et élégance. Le liquide ne manque pas de corps, mais pour un stout à 7%, peut-être un peu. Du moins le taux dalcool est imperceptible pour moi. Je crois vraiment boire un stout typiquement écossais bien houblonné. Une certaine amertume se développe à la longue alors que sestompent les fruits. Finale très sèche, densité moyenne en bouche, je boirais volontiers de ce stout à la plage.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

1943,"2015-09-11",3.6,"This was poured into a snifter.
The appearance was a black color with an off white to tan color-ed foamy head that dissipated within less than two minutes. Lacing was super thick and foamy, really clinging to the glass.
The smell started off with big roasty coffee beans running into delicate milk and dark chocolate tones. Light black licorice does end up rounding it out nicely.
The taste was semi-bitter with the roasty and sweet tones of the coffee and chocolate coming in to balance. Light roasty aftertaste rolled into a dry semi-sweet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a good carbonation about it - its fairly smooth and leads to a nice sipping quality about it.

1943,"2015-02-01",3.8,"Perfect pre-game beer. Purchased from Beverage Warehouse in Winooski last Tuesday evening. $5.04 for the 650 mL bottle. I knew that once I had seen they carried Pelican I would be committing a disservice by ignoring it entirely. Served at 52°F. Had let it warm up a bit before consuming. 
 
To oversized snifter, it pours a mahogany/oaken-tinted dark brown with which a frothy cosmic latte-ringed head 1½ fingers in length stood. Aromas of black bread, charcoal, Midwest hops, dried mandarin orange peels, licorice root, earl grey tea, cocoa butter, melted wax, and mint sprigs. 

Tastes the same with the addition of coffee syrup, burnt sugar, aloe vera, and a pleasurable growing warmth. This is a superbly satisfying stout, but its honestly a tad too bitter. You have to concentrate in order to get anything aside from the floral hops and darkly-kilned malts. But, I am happy with my purchase of this item.

Aroma: melty dark chocolate, general coffee roasty notes, some black bread, maybe a bit of earthy hops. Taste: dark, bittersweet chocolate, growing sweeter and more fudgy as it warms; it doesnt get overly sweet, as the espresso notes and some gentle, slightly minty hops keep things balanced. Finish: medium-length, with lasting dry chocolate and general roast, then a whisper of pine to clean things up completely. Notes: Why, why, why was this so damn good? Everything about it seemed like it would be average, until it entered my mouth. Everything about this beer was in perfect harmony.

1943,"2014-08-23",3.7,"Well, it looks like a stout: as black as sin with only a suggestion of mahogany in the dimple of the glass and a crema of latter coloured head.

It is medium-bodied with a sherbety mouthfeel and a faintly astringent finish. 
So, my immediate thought is that this beer is a stout. Well, duh. However, it is an archetypal stout. Bang on in all the categories it should be however theres just something about it that fails to capture my imagination.

1943,"2014-05-04",3.3,"First off this is a beautiful beer, perfect in appearance for a stout. It is deep black w/ a creamy off-white head that lasts the duration of a pint-sized pour. The beer, overall, is not quite as good as it looks but, hey, how many things are perfect? It is chocolaty and roast w/ a rather mild nose. A very slight touch of tartness and a bit of sweetness bring out some raisin-like malt. It finishes dry and clean w/ a lingering coffee tote on the tongue. My main problem with this, as far as I have one, is that its over seven percent alcohol but doesnt really taste big enough to justify that strength. If it werent for a little bit of alcohol heat, Id have had no idea this wasnt a (rather good) session stout. On the other hand, I do suppose this is relatively easy drinking for a stronger beer.

The taste was bitter sweet with a nice malty feel and had notes of bitter chocolate and molasses from the beginning, progressing slightly into a purely bitter taste with a huge coffee presence and a mild smoky finish. The flavor lasted a very long time after the swallow with a bold smooth bitter coffee taste left to linger for quit a while.

Mouthfeel was full in body with a dry, oily texture and a solid medium carbonation.

Tsunami Stout pours a strong coffee and molasses color, with only a few rays sneaking through the cusp when held up to the light. A modest tan head provides a nice finish to a solid looking beer.

Strong mocha aroma, with hazelnut and light coffee notes along for the ride.

Bitter chocolate and a touch of espresso dominate the dark, roasted malt. Coffee infused hops finish out the robust taste. 

A little bit creamy, but still with a fair amount of carbonation. The carbonation endures from the pour to the last sip. Despite the strong taste, it has a balanced feel on the tongue, leaving just a light coffee bitterness at the end.

On tap at Pelican in November 2010. Black hole black with a smooth, creamy, chocolatey brown swirled cap that leaves 360 deg lacing. Even the initial lacing had layered colouring.

Apparently I never fully warmed my core up after wandering around earlier. Welcoming coffee wafts around, almond, chocolate, light citrus, some biscuit. The sweet citurs is interesting and pops up here and there to separate this just a bit from the masses. Tasty and creamy - hints of spice (Medicinal? Why was that written in my notes with a bunch of question marks?), floral taste? What the hell was I taking notes of? Dull coffee, chocolate and smooth dark caramel.

Char and grass...Pours almost inky black, actually very, very dark brown with just a wisp of brownish head that recedes to the edges. Looks much like an imp stout. Aroma of plum, char, molasses, grape and almost burnt coffee. Mouthfeel fairly smooth, light oiliness, low carbonation, actually a little loose and light-feeling. Flavor starts out heavy on char with a grassiness that detracts. As it warms the grassiness abates a bit and dark chocolate, plum/grape, coffee and char emerge. Bitterness builds toward finish and leaves a bitter coffee/choccolate aftertaste. Some alcohol presence. Quite imp stout-like overall.

Poured deep brown with lovely initial cap of tan head.. settled to a fine, but thorough dusting after a couple minutes.  The aroma picked up an intriguing combination of sweeter chocolates, oats, and some lactic character with deeper malts in the form of molasses, licorice, and coffee.. sweet and succulent overall impression.  The flavor opened with a smooth, almost buttery foray of semi-sweet cake-like chocolates, opening into a fluffy middle of milky chocolates and charred coffee.. found some herbal bitterness to brighten up the mood and accompany the dark malts through the finish.  Medium-plus bodied and velvety on the palate with just enough carbonation to keep it moving along.. complex array of malts that worked well together.. memorable finish (in the good way).

The look: Black body topped by a beige ring of foam
In long: This is a roasted one.  I got lots of burnt toasts in the flavour along with light roasted coffee.  As the beer warmed up some milk chocolate and some black chocolate came through.  Almost nothing in the fruity flavours department.  Carbonation was very active, maybe too much so, making the body feel a bit thin a giving a tickling mouthfeel.  Overall quite dry. This was a very good stout but I was hoping for more.  Nothing to turn me upside down, just a very big wave really.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Its a bit on the stronger, but alcohol is not outrightly noticeable.  The finish tastes like roasted coffee finish and there is a long-lasting, dry espresso bitterness and dark chocolate after taste.  This  beer is is very smooth and creamy and feels rich and full in the mouth.  It goes down frighteningly quick and easy for a beer of this complexity and alcohol content!  Tsunami Stout is an excellent beer.   I highly recommend it!

1943,"2006-04-12",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 1, 2008 Any first impressions?
-A thin but covering foam dissipates onto the opaque blackness.
-Wealthy roasted malts and their dark chocolate acolytes rise distinctly to emulate a specialty sweets shop.
-Chocolate envelops the few coffee beans in a luxurious union only the talented can create.
-The body is huggable (to be polite), full of authentic maltiness, without too much residual sweetness.

What if you dig deeper?
-Sweet berry juice sneaks up behind the maltiness in the aroma.
-It finishes very quietly, which might be its only downfall imho; some more back roastiness or supporting hops would have been fun.
-Hops are of no consequence in my bottle; this is a malt lovers dream stout.
-A rich and serene chocolatey stout which can reach both those looking for session stouts and those looking for nourishment in the form of a pint. Splendid.

1943,"2006-02-25",3.7,"Pours with a creamy, dense, three-finger thick, full, milk chocolate colored head.  The beer is a pitch black color, nice and opaque.  The aroma is acidic up front; redolent of ample dark malts.  Rich notes of dark chocolate, espresso beans dominate afterwards with sharp, burnt astringent grain husk notes in the finish, that arent nearly as harsh as it might seem.  Actually the finish is quite nice, the overall aroma is quite warm and inviting.

The taste has a sweet chocolate note to it up front, which is quickly dominated by an ample roast character that reminds me of chicory, and black coffee.  The beer has a nice palate fullness to it; coating but not cloying, just thick enough that the contemplation of the upcoming 22oz bottle is not too overwhelming.  The beer finishes with a burnt acidity that actually tends to keep this Imperial Stout a bit lighter than it otherwise would be.  This is pretty light on the hops, at least for this type of beer; there is a bit of bitterness just noticeable under all the dark malts (which means there is probably quite a bit), but not much in the way of any flavor hop additions.  This lets this beer focus on the malt, which in this case is mostly the dark malts.

This beer is quite tasty, but it could definitely use a bit more general malt character; a bit thicker and maltier would make this beer a bit more balanced, but then it would be a bit harder to get through a 22oz bottle.  As this beer warms up a bit it gains a bit more fullness in the mouth, and correspondingly a bit more malt character.  It could still use a bit more, but it is a bit more balanced than it first was when it was 50*F.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

 though still dark, acidic, and bittersweet. Full of lasting flavor, too. the name, however, had me anticipating a monsoon of flavor, like an Imperial Stout, and that is not the case. An excellent ""regular"" stout, shall we say, but one still abundant with flavor. Quite nice, actually, and remarkably similar to Guinness Extra Stout.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

Jet black with a dark tan head was visually appealing.  The nose was coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, molasses, fruit.  Complex and satisfying.  Full bodied, creamy mouthfeel.

1943,"2004-03-17",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 6, 2006 2003 bomber.  Flashlighted tested opaque.  Black with a deep tan head that fizzes to the top and quickly disippates.  Lace clings to the edges.  Aroma is pretty decent for a dry stout, ok, better than decent, the fact that I can smell alot of roast and a hint of dark chocolate says alot.  Very aromatic for its style.  Flavor begins with a big dry bitter roast, moderately oily with dark chocolate in the background.  Quite carbonated unfortunately, very much so, even after letting stand and warm for a while.  This seemed to detract from the body and texture, making for a not-nearly-as-creamy-as-hoped-for experience.  Flavor was big and bold, that was a plus, but I thought the body was only medium, not wonderfully complex either.  Some decent, bitter hops on the finish, with an almost cafe au lait flavor.  A solid, fairly flavorful beer that has no major flaws, with my biggest complaint being the sharp, carbonated texture.  I bet this would gain quite a few points on draft. 9/5/7/3/142004 draught  Same wonderful appearance, dark brown/black, very deep and opaque with a creamy light beige/tan head.  Aroma, even on draft out of a shaker is phenomenal.  Still the best, and most powerful aroma Ive encountered on a dry stout.  Chocolate, light roast, almonds, and a barley-like lacto creaminess.  On draught, the body was very full, while the flavor played catch up.  Very roasty and dry, but still has some good dark chocolate notes.  Low hops apparency and a much smoother, creamier palate than in the bottle.  Aroma, appearance and a strong, flavorful body are all highlights here.  Perhaps a bit lacking in the complexity department.  But still, there is an obviouly large amount of malt and unmalted barley in here giving it more oomph than your average watery irish dry stout, and I applaud that.   9/5/8/4/16","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The aroma is fruity (cherry, current, and grapefruit), semi-sweet chocolate, molasses, aromatic and noble hops, smoky and woody, dusty yeast esters. The taste is balanced between the sweet mocha roasted malt nature and a blend of hops (northern American and European). A fruity nature is detected midsection and is followed by a vanilla flavored coffee and smoky wood character. Medium to full-bodied, this stout produces a rich, smooth and astringent mouthfeel, nicely complex on the tongue.

Low, dry, dusted chocolate roast with veins of rich, syrupy, chocolate alcohol aroma. The flavor is of wet roasted chocolate with a noticeable hop bite and suitable bitterness. The flavor profile vacillates between dry and imperial stout. In my opinion, this has the perfect body for a stout--not heavy, nor light--just right. A well crafted stout regardless.
