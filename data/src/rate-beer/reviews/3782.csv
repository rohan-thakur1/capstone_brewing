3782,"2017-05-25",3.4,"On tap at Barrelworks. It pours dark brown with a khaki head. The aroma has a with bourbon alcohol note up front with baked bread, spices and plum. The flavor is nutty with a little bourbon, alcohol, plums and bread. Light spice. Low carbonation. Pretty boozy for a 7% beer.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3782,"2017-05-17",4.1,"Almost clear amber color with a ring of tan foam. Aroma has toffee, some weizen sweetness, candied banana. Taste is really balanced. Sweet toffee at first, follows with elegant bourbon, finishes with earthy bitterness. Light body, low to medium carbonation, quite dry. A really nice combination of flavors.","Timisoara, ROMANIA","ciocanelu"

Aroma is super malty, sweet, dark sugars, kind of a malt liquor nose, apple, wheat, toffee, grain. Flavor is very sweet, light bitter, kind of crazy. Full body.

3782,"2017-04-03",4.3,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 11/1/2016. Pours lightly hazy deep orange/amber/copper color with a 1 finger fairly dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big raisin, plum, caramel, brown sugar, banana, peppercorn, clove, pear, apple, vanilla, brown bread, bourbon, and toasted oak; with lighter notes of coconut, toffee, maple syrup, bubblegum, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, caramel, brown sugar, banana, peppercorn, clove, pear, apple, vanilla, brown bread, bourbon, and toasted oak; with lighter notes of coconut, toffee, maple syrup, bubblegum, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate peppery yeast and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, caramel, brown sugar, banana, peppercorn, clove, pear, apple, vanilla, brown bread, bourbon, toasted oak, light bubblegum/toffee, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from yeast/oak spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready, and lightly silky/sticky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 9.2%, with zero barrel booziness. Overall this is an incredible weizenbock! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, dark/bready malt, and bourbon barrel flavors; very smooth and easy to sip on for the big ABV. Awesome classic style complexity, with pretty much perfect barrel balance. Never boozy or overly tannic. Hits the advertised bananas foster flavors really well. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
3782,"2017-03-25",3.8,"9.2% on the bottle. Amber brown color. 
Aroma is huge on the banana, almost a bananas foster with the barreling to back it up. Heavy alcohol for a sub 10% beer, but with a slightly thinner body than expected. Unique and good, not quite great.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
3782,"2017-03-04",4.2,"Pours a golden brown color with a khaki head. Caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, bourbon, oak, molasses, maple syrup, dark fruit and banana aroma and flavors.

Flavor is bready, mildly sweet, and fruity. Wish theyd bottle this and make it a regular brew!","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
3782,"2016-04-03",3.5,"Draft at the brewery in Paso Robles. Really Im the first rating? Okay. Hazy and dark golden pour with almost no head aromas of spicy wheat and some light banana. Flavors were similar. Pretty good stuff.","Santee/San Diego, California, USA","fordest"
