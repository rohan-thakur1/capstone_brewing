3314,"2016-09-06",4.0,"Almost opaque veiled brown caramel color with lots of fizzy glass clinging activity. Thick creamy and foamy beige 3 finger island head, lasting around 10 to 15 minutes, with a good amount of legs.

Aromas of grass, fresh flowers, and caramel. Flavors of lemony citrus with noble spices. Hints of flowers and nuts. Highly bitter with a strong sharpness and faint sweetness. Very tasty and fully flavored.

Oily full body with a fresh perfect dose of champagne like carbonation. Strong and long finish, ending with lingering noble spices, a grassy tongue coat, and faint salivating sweetness with a floral touch.

Overall excellent quality craft. Delicious flavors, well balanced, and complex. One of the most incredible grassy feel Ive ever tasted. High bitterness but still enjoyable and fresh with a nice zest, like a witbier pilsner. A little boozy, slight vinous, but still minimal.","Quebec, CANADA","Bierdimpfe"

Visuel: Blonde / dorée, assez claire, avec une bonne mousse rocailleuse, assez épaisse et persistante. Elle laisse une petite dentelle discrète sur les parois du verre. 
Gustatif: Lattaque est sèche, tout en grains et en céréales avec de surprenantes notes de pommes de terre. Présence daccents terreux, de foin. Lamertume est bien présente en finale, laissant une trace de terre sèche. Les flaveurs de céréales sont très distinctes et très bien réussies.

3314,"2013-07-30",3.3,"Wow, what a hot day in central Texas... I could really use a lager right now, even if it is from Quebec! Bright golden orange in color, mostly clear with a full, billowy, frothy bright white head... The thick carbonation really sustains this head. Its never ending! It has a classic lager aroma, but pleasant, grainy, slightly fruity, with a touch of what seems like a little bacteria or yeasty sourness. Some slight caramel sweetness also comes through in the nose. The flavor is absolutely nothing like what I expected, with a very bitter, grainy character that defies what youd normally expect of a lager. Its closer to a bitter pilsener, really, but with some crystal malts in play. Its finish is bitter, with light malt backing. Nice, and very different. Fresh, clean pilsener grains leave an effect in the mouth that reminds you that barley is fermentable.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

Quite a complex nose to marry a hop driven palate. Inside its creamy, a light pocket of spritzy carbonation upfront before a soft, smooth finish. The hops are in high gear giving it a rough, herbaceous and woody edge. The swallow assertively bitter with a clean piney drop off. Light malt sweetness upfront with a little toasted grain showing mid-palate, quite gritty, barnyardy. The body relatively light, yet rounded. It out weighs and out punches its meagre 5.5% ABV, giving the impression of a far stronger beer. There is even a touch of hot alcohol in the swallow (?) that sits flush with the hefty flavours. Drawn citrus fruit like tangelo and blood orange, and hints of peach build as it goes giving it a freshness. This is a lipsmacker that I cant quite pigeonhole. A strange Keller, but a good one!

Peppery, floral hops offer the aromatic counterpoint, while notes of tinny mineral water and countryside air lend a natural, earthy freshness.

App.:  Cloudy golden with a rocky white foam.

Rich silken mouth feel with an incredible amber Munich malt spine in perfect balance with both bittering and aromatic noble hopping.

Flavour profile starts with a big chew of thick bready malt in the front which is quickly balanced by Hallertauer and Hersbrucker bittering, mid palate some sweetness and light apple tones get a musty woody undertone from the Spalter and Tettnanger hopping, then a clean dry finish with a biscuity after taste...bloody awesome lager","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

3314,"2008-09-04",4.3,"750mL bottle from a trade with a friend in Ottawa. Pours a nice hazy orange colour with a huge beige head.  A style I should by all reasonable logic be in love with (a nice big F*** YOU to the Beer Store and the LCBO for neglecting such an awesome style). So this one really was awesome. Like a caramelized version of Christoffel Blonde. Huge hoppy aroma with promising Munich malts underneath. Awesome toffee-caramalt body with huge piney hops to add perfect balance. Not a whole lot of yeast considering its unfiltered, but the flavours present more than make up for that. Mouth-feel is medium but definitely fuller than a regular Pilsener. Delicious tasting beer. Kind of an ambiguous beer stylistically. Not a whole lot that I can say for some reason, but that in no way reflects how great I find this beer to be. 750mL just isnt quite enough!","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

Looks great like last time, huge fluffy head over streaming bubbles in a dark yellow / copper pour.  Fresh hoppy aroma still there as well, no change on those scores.  What does change is how much more complex and flavourful this is to my benchmark now:  Creemore Kellerbier, which I really enjoy and drink by the truck load.  So palate, taste, and overall go up.

Lots of creamy bready pils malts perhaps some wheat, light toast, a bit of lager yeastiness (jsut a hint of sulfur) and great crisp earthy hops in teh midlle and end.

3314,"2008-07-06",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 9, 2009 In short: A very nourishing countryside cornfield in a bottle with a strong pilsner attitude.  Kick-ass
How: Many bottles 750ml + 2 x tap at Vices & Versa.  Very fresh, drank in the weeks following the beer release
The look: Looks varies from partly cloudy golden body (bottle) to totally opaque dark yellow body (tap) but always topped by a large white head with medium retention
In long:  Nose is very corny.  Im almost sure there is no corn in this beer but somehow the hay and grassy hops come together as intensely corn on the nose along with some meringue.  Ive rarely got such an intense corn aroma from a beer.  Once I poured myself a glass at a party and my buddy Marc-André standing 2 feet away from me said my beer smelled like corn.  Im not kidding you.  Body is quite nourishing for a Pilsner.  Lots and lots of crisp dry hay.  A bit bready too.  Dry grainy honeyed cereals with just a little cramel.  Again that dry corn sensation.  Fluffy body.  Superb mouthfeel.  Fresh bananas, some peaches and lemon skin.  A light lactic/whip-cream sensation.  Plenty of dry gassy hops with a finish that is more dry than bitter.  So we have an Oktoberfest that came out in May and is not of the Marzen/Oktoberfest style.  Thats breaking two traditions at once, like me coming back home on a Friday night sober and with a cute girl.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
3314,"2008-06-26",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2008 My Bottom Line:
Herbaceous, grassy hops grow amidst farmy, grainy cereals before caramel-laden bread brings the tastebuds to a long noble hop bitterness in this peacefully carbonated and immensely poundable Québécois Kellerbier.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A lasting tower of foam provides fine lacing atop the hazy blondish amber with golden highlights.
-That nose is astoundingly rural. I know the Frontenac malts must have something to do with it, but they are so brilliantly paired with the noble hops and the chosen yeast that they dont appear crude (which they often do).
-The carbonation nearly emulates that from actual Kellerbiers served from the cask; big bubbles, but so soft.
-Wheres my Mass krug?

3314,"2008-06-26",3.9,"As I put the nose over my nose, husky, rustic malt invade my nostrils and provide a lot of pleasure, theres also a presence of grassy, noble hops in there that provide balance and add to the enjoyment. The pour reveals a clear dark gold color with a thick white head that diminishes to a medium one. In the mouth, the malt is again on center stage with its dry, rustic, husky, astringent presence, the grassy hops plays the role of the sidekick in this show but Im glad hes there, theres some bitterness in the end. The body is medium to full with a creamy texture and moderate carbonation. This is a very pleasant summer release, its extremely well done.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"

3314,"2008-05-26",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2009 Objectively speaking:
A fresh pilsner out of a 750mL bottle. Clean, fresh and vibrant.


I like:
Charming fresh pils malt aroma. Generous lacey white head. Almost expansive carbonation is pillowy soft, not crisp as youd expect, becoming rather creamy in fact, but very smooth and pleasant all the same. Soft hoppiness providing just enough bitterness to enhance drinkability and neglecting the aromas as per German influence. Not as lean and dry as youd expect a German pils, but the malts are absolutely charming. Of course its not as idiosyncratic as the MacAllen, but its just as well brewed.



I dislike:
Some rumours spoke of some bottles being spoiled by DMS. This was certainly not the case of my bottle which was as clean as it gets. I just tried the new 2009 version, the 750mL green label. It remains a relatively dry, highly drinkable beer with a strong leafy, very herbal finish. The Frontenac maltiness is highly perceivable, round, green and strawy. I remembered last year as more refreshing, but perhaps less bitter. Still, its a true pleasure to bathe into such great yet uncommon beers. Not changing the rating.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
