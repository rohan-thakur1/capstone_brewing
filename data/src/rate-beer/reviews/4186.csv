4186,"2015-12-02",3.5,"Clear dark amber color with a short, lasting beige head. Sweet sugary nose. Toffee sweetness with some burnt malts, raisins and ripe fruit. Lots of lively carbonation on the tongue. Sweet malty beer","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
4186,"2014-12-24",4.0,"Flying Bison makes some damn decent lager beers. This one is a brilliant chestnut brown, perfectly clear with a small head of fine bubbles. Its nose has bit of caramel and a nice floral note to round out out. This is a nice, malty beer but still relatively dry and drinkable. There is just a hair of sweetness to bring out some chocolate to go with the otherwise toasty, bready malt character. This is a full bodied brew but the carbonation is vigorous enough to cut through and keep it from feeling too heavy. It finishes with some lingering raisin sweetness and a touch of bitterness. Nobody cares about German styles anymore but if they did this brewery would be got shit.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a mahogany color to ruby-brownish color with a one finger of mocha colored head. The head has a decent level of retention leaving a nice level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass once it fades.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is heaviest of sweeter smells of toffee and caramel with some lighter sweet smells of a dark fruit nature of raisin and cherry mixed within. Other aromas of a more toasted malt smell as well as a bit of a roasted brown bread smell are there as well. 

 Taste  The taste begins with a roasted malt taste combined with tons of caramel and toffee sweetness. The roasted malt gets a little bit more toasted as the flavor advances, with the sweet flavors growing more intense as some darker fruit flavors also join the tongue. At the same time a little bit of a nutty flavor joins the tongue, maintaining a rather light presence to the end of the taste. The caramel and toffee surge again at the end, along with a little bit of cinnamon and nutmeg and some more roasted malt coming to the tongue, to in the end, leave a rather smooth and sweet malty flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the slightly thicker side with a carbonation level that is on the slightly lower side. For the style, with all the roasted and sweet flavors, the combo of thickness and carbonation are rather nice, and helps create a slower sipper then would traditionally be encountered for a brew of only 6.1 % abv.

 Overall  A rather tasty and sweet malty winter brew. Rather tasty and a nice winter warmer without all the boozy flavors.","","Darkmagus82"

Overall, I have always been a fan of the Blizzard Bock (aka Hoops) but this years offering seem to lacked in carbonation, which really enhances the flavor.","North Tonawanda, New York, USA","merc7186"

4186,"2011-01-03",3.6,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2015 Bottle.  Pours a deep mahogany with a frothy brown head.  Head fades pretty quickly.  Definite chocolate-hazelnut vibe to it, with a very creamy mouthfeel.  Good beer for sure, one of the best Ive had from Flying Bison, I think.  Almost a little too sweet, though.

4186,"2009-02-20",3.4,"Bottle (12oz).  Clear deep mahogany pour with a large frothy tan head (4-).  Sweet aroma, roast cereal grain and chocolate, floral and dry.  The taste follows - sweet, but plenty of woody bitterness to even it out, more dry cocoa than in the nose.  Light body, mild carbonation, slight alcohol warmth in the quick finish - sort of a powdery dry chocolate finish.  Nice lighter winter drink.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

4186,"2005-12-08",3.8,"Growler from Rudolf, Dougs, Christmas 2005.  Wow, the surprise of the evening for sure.  Dark brown, decent tan head.  Aroma of sweet dark malt and pot (Im not kidding, I dont smoke, but have been to enough concerts to smell ""Ottos Jacket"" - that is what it smelled like).  Taste is very nice - a good dunkel full of sweetness and assertive medium body.  Finishes with some hops.  Maybe not as complex as the Dennisons Dunkel, which is my favourite in this style, but it approaches that level.  What a pleasant surprise, well done guys.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
