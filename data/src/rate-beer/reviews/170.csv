170,"2016-10-16",4.9,"Moka porter dont la recette semble avoir quelque peu changé depuis mon exemplaire, à moins que
ce soit linverse ?? Toujours est-il que mon étiquette mentionnait bien 7,4 % abv, mais 50 ebu au
lieu de 60 sur le site. Le houblon était stipulé comme des USA, mais pas le simcoe spécifiquement.
Dans ma composition on parle bien dune infusion de cacao et café arabica, mais pas du sucre demerara. Malts dorge et de blé rôtis, avoine.
Mon exemplaire avait un mois d e plus que sa date.
Couleur noire comme du charbon, à lopacité quasi totale.
Mousse qui est un nappage brun foncé, assez soyeux.
Arômes de malt grillé, café, pointe de seigle, cacao, écorce de bouleau.
1ère bouche souple à lentame malt grillé, baies noires, pointe danis étoilé délicate.
Arrière-bouche avec une belle amertume (noublions pas les 50 ebu, qui sont peut-être maintenant 60, ou linverse??).
2ème à la très belle progression, les saveurs sont plus fondues.
Arrière-bouche complexe et longue, plutôt sur le café.
3ème où on sent des grains de café réellement.
Arrière-bouche à la qualité dun excellent arabica.
Longueur aux belles nuances grains/malt/café/chocolat noir avec malgré tout un très léger fléchissement de lharmonie.
Jambes assez huileuses.
Levure souple et forte, belle ligne.
Alcool très correct, il assure sur la longueur, mais ne peut éviter le petit couac.
Finale qui reprend des couleurs, si on peut dire...
CONCLUSION : red eye nous sert un très joli panel café/malt torréfié, mais flanche un peu sur 
la longueur par faute dinattention (normal avec les yeux rouges !!), pour revenir en beauté en finale... Il faut absolument que je contrôle la version actuelle de cette bière, et la retester au besoin

Bár véleményem szerint a kávé karaktere az ""imperial"" jelleggel felvértezett italoknak jobban áll, ez esetben sem találhatunk semmi kivetnivalót a sörben; mind illata, mind íze remekül adja vissza egy eszpresszó hangulatát. Pörkölt, szójás aromáihoz réteges, mély ízjegyek társulnak, míg szerkezete igen krémes, mondhatni bársonyos.

 Data ważności:  20.07.2016 
 Cena:  12,60 PLN 
 Kolor:  Ciemnobrązowy, prawie czarny. Brak przejrzystości. 
 Piana:  Początkowo byłem entuzjastycznie nastawiony w tej kwestii.
Piana była beżowa, pięknie szła do góry, rysując wysoką górę drobnych bąbelków.
Wkrótce jednak z prędkością wodospadu zaczęła opadać w dół. 
Po kilku minutach nie było już po niej śladu.
Nie pozostawiła po sobie również śladów na szkle. 
 Zapach:  Uhh La La! Powiem szczerze, że aromat na prawdę może zrobić wrażenie. Nawet na bardzo wymagających Beer Geekach.
Przede wszystkich jest kawa, taka prawdziwa, włoska 100%-owa kawa.
Odnoszę wrażenie jakby całe ziarenka kawy zostały wrzucone do butelki dla podbicia aromatu.
Jest również spienione mleko, solidna palona nuta i od groma wysokiej jakości czekolady.
Z daleka do nosa dochodzą także sugestie lekko podwędzonych śliwek, a także kapka karmelu.
Czapki z głów! 
 Smak:  Maga kawowe! Tutaj jest kawa esperesso z dodatkiej spienionego mleka. Czuć bardzo intensywnie ziarenka kawy.
Prawie zgrzytają między zębami.
Paloność jest na wysokim poziomie. 
W tej kwestii piwo zbliżone jest do niejednego RIS-a.
Jest także gorzka czekolada, szczypta włoskich orzechów, trochę karmelu i mnóstwo palonych słodów. 
Paloność przechodzi już potem w popiołowość.
Początkowo porter wydawał się nawet dość słodki, jednak na finiszu był już wybitnie wytrawny.
Odczucie w ustach gładkie, kremowe, wytrawne.
Goryczka średnia, krótka z palonymi nutami.
Tekstura gęsta, zawiesista.
Świetny trunek! 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Dopiero teraz kiedy skończyłem pisać recenzję spojrzałem na kotrę etykiety.
Jest tam informacja o użyciu wysokiej jakości palonych ziaren brazylijskiej kawy @Fazenda Pantano.
To właśnie te intensywne aromatycznie, oraz smakowo ziarenka kształtują główny profil piwa.
Piwo jest mocno kawowe z akcentami spienionego mleka, bardzo gorzkiej czekolady, orzechów włoskich i szczypty karmelu.
W aromacie przemycona została także lekka sugestia podwędzonych śliwek.
Piwo spełnia wszystkie warunki topowego Porteru.
Jak dla mnie brakuje jedynie odrobinę słodyczy, ale dla fanów wytrawniejszych piw w tym właśnie stylu - euforia jest gwarantowana.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

Taste is a bit thinner than aroma promises but strong espresso present, roasted malts, bitter chocolate. Light sweetness notto make it too dry - still not sweet.

170,"2014-02-28",4.0,"Bottle from The Bottle Shop Canterbury, drunk at home. Dark brown almost black beer with a lasting tan head. Fuck loads of coffee on the aroma. Bad beer to have at 22.47 of an evening when you need to get some sleep as the caffeine in this smells pretty extreme. I love good coffee beers. And this is one of them. Sugar yes. Coffee yes. Wow. Thats a big slap of sugary espresso right in your face. Doesnt make me any less drunk, just makes me wide eyed and goggled eyed. Well I may get some sleep in about 48 hours time after this, but I wouldnt bet on it. Hilarious but hugely fun and only £4.50 a bottle.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
170,"2014-02-18",4.4,"500ml bottle from The Beerhive. 
Big bubbly tan head, some good lacing. Dark black body. Rich chocolate nose, some citrus coming through. Big mocha flavour, a bit orange, berries on the finish. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Very light carbonation. No hint of the abv in drinking it. This beer is an absolute gem.

170,"2013-12-17",3.9,"Bottle from Cornelius. Black body with a large beige head that holds well. Excellent lacing. I could smell this the second I started pouring - gorgeous aroma of ash, Terrys chocolate orange, wood smoke, espresso and Twiglets. Flavour of charcoal and a hint of spice and black chocolate. Its very bitter and quite harsh. Medium body with a sticky mouthfeel. Average carbonation. A distinctive, flavoursome Porter. When I read that it was hopped with Simcoe and was 60 IBU, I was hoping for a hoppy Porter, verging on a Black IPA, but this is a Porter thats very dry, ashy and challenging.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","jamestulloch"

170,"2012-12-19",3.9,"Bottle at home (from Ninas Mini Market, Edinburgh) - 19/12/12.
Light black with a thin tan head that quickly dissipates to the edge of the glass and leaves a film atop.
Nose is big mocha coffee, rich roast, really delivers the mission statement in this sense. Behind the dominant coffee theres a little roast malt, sweet sugary espresso.
The taste doesnt match up to the nose however it delivers a solid coffee infused porter. Roast malt, bitter sweet dark sugar, espresso coffee, light chocolate.
Medium bodied, quite thin for a 7.4 % beer to be honest, soft carbonation, dry finish.
An excellent porter from Tempest.","Hazlemere, the lower Xhitlerns, Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Theydon_Bois"

170,"2011-12-29",4.1,"50cl bottle (my first bottle from this relatively young brewery though Ive had keg/cask before). Pours opaque black/mahogany with a very generous beige creamy head. The nose has freshly ground coffee beans and a green note which is closer to pistachios than anything else. As the head subsides there is a spice/vegetable note which I think is actually a mild green chilli pepper. The taste has a huge hit of that ground coffee and the green pepper and there is a nice layer of cream which glides over the top. The palate is medium to large in structure with a thick and creamy middle section texture and an elegant dry finish. Overall, this is a great beer - another excellent Scottish Porter.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","AshtonMcCobb"
