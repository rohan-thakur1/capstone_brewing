2435,"2015-12-21",4.0,"375 ml bottle, shared. Clear amber-gold pour with 2-3 bubbles bursting through at the surface. Aroma of rich candied apples, apple pie, moderate musty apple cider notes, light brown sugar. Taste is sweet, rich caramelized apple flavors. Palate is med bodied, hardly sparkling at all really. Good but carbonation is worthless, just go for the regular product.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2435,"2015-10-25",4.1,"375mL bottle, pours a clear gold with bubbles that dissipate quickly. Aroma brings out medium sweet apples, a little treacle, and some candied caramel. Flavour is complex as hell, with treacly notes and medium sweet candied apples that are tempered in sweetness from the carbonation. Fantastic complexity to this - the carbonation makes this a whole different beast. Phenomenal stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2435,"2015-08-28",3.8,"375 ml bottle to snifter (shared with the Mrs on our 5th Anniversary; thanks DuffMan!). 2009 vintage. Looks solid; no carbonation though. A still, transparent caramelish orange. Smells good; like a fine ice cider. A great concentrated apple presence with a sweet but not cloying backbone that is almost honey-like. Tastes like it smells with a smooth medium full-bodied mouthfeel. A nice balance of sweetness and crispness from the apples.  Some peel on the tongue as well.  Damn good stuff, regardless of its lack of carbonation.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
2435,"2015-07-16",4.1,"Bottle shared at RBAG 2015 by Ferris. Tawny gold, medium to high viscosity...and some bubbles! Cool. The palate has all the character that I love in a well made Quebecois ice cider: baked apples, vanilla cookie, honey. The carbonation adds an interesting texture to the palate. I dont think it detracts from the complexity here, but does lend a different mouthfeel. I dont think Ive ever had a carbonated ice cider before-- are there any others in existence? Tasty and cool.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

Flavors seem much brighter; notes of apple champagne, fresh juice, fruit slices and light honey.

Mild plum character. Flavors are zesty and slightly musty. Massive acidity balances the massive sweetness. Slightly oxidized flavors. Carbonation is prickly but not intense at all. Very well balanced for the amount of sweetness. Tons of brown sugar. Full bodied and decadent.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
2435,"2013-11-09",3.9,"Poured from bottle into wine glass. Whoa boy, my first ice cider and it didn't disappoint. Intense apple sweetness. Instead of being cloying and overbearing, it's well complemented by a deep, warming funk. Like a moldy brown liquor. I mean that in a good way too. Really changes my understanding of what a cider can be.

2435,"2010-07-21",4.0,"375ml bottle, corked and caged.  2006 vintage, consumed in July 2010.  Pouring crystal clear and medium golden in color, the body is nearly still, with just tiny, slow streams of micro-bubbles that meander towards the surface.  After a swirl of the glass, a thick, sugary coating gradually gives way to gravity, dripping back down the glass in dense, weighty legs.  The nose is simultaneously musty and insanely sweet, showing notes of Granny Smith apples that are just starting to brown and oxidize, along with golden honey, vanilla bean, and hints of airborne yeast.  Acidity from the apples does just enough to keep the sweetness in check, and the wild must lends a nice, earthy dryness.  Flavors follow suit, again decadent in their rich, honeyed apples sweetness, yet sufficiently acidic and sharp, like a spicy golden crab apple.  Musty yeast again imparts a certain wild dryness that I really appreciate.  The lambic lover in me takes pleasure in the earthen, farmhouse character that this cider brings.  On the palate, delicate carbonation pushes along and intensifies the acidity, lending a sharp edge to the otherwise full, sticky, mouth coating body.  This is a fine digestif, suitable for slow, delactable sipping on a cool winter night.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

2435,"2007-12-01",4.3,"2005 bottling consumed in 07. So pale is the golden pour, it seems to be glazed with a white sugarcoating of soft carbonation that trickles slowly to the top. Legs are thick and coverage is three quarters of the available space. This looks like a sleepy Champagne, sultry and elegant. The aroma is richer than Ive yet experienced in ice cider or icewine, with the sole exception of the Inniskillen Pinot Noir icewine. Apples in the nose are so tightly crammed, so sugary and so deeply wound into complex microcosms of acids and earthy must. I feel like I can sense a tangible brix reading thats on a new chart, a chart that had to be re-scaled to measure the ferocious intensity and high residual sugars this presents so effortlessly. Nectars of firmly pressed multiple varities of fruit skins parade across the palate with just a slight inhalation and beg a sip. Brown sugar and ultra-sweetened caramels coat the edge of each whiff. Alcohol only serves as a depthy addition to this bakery-in-the-morning aromatic composition. Each time I draw the flute to my nose I feel like Im in the loft bar that is Redlight/Redlight and the apple pies and fritters encrusted with brown sugar have been left in the oven too long in the bakery below - the fire department is on the way and the flames will be extinguished when I finally give in and take the first sip. One taste and my mind is spinning and my heart is racing. The complexity throughout a small sip, the bold finish full of bready notes and glazed sugars, is terrific! Soft carbonation disperses mild must-coated apple skin notes that eventually release a candy and juice combination that is lightly tart and causes shuddering. Wild sweetness and complexity that skates past preconceived notions of the limits previously encountered is a beautiful feature. Buttery sweet pastry notes are monstrous and fit perfectly with the mild acidity. The mouthfeel is quite full for a sparkling beverage, sparse though the carbonation is. At the flavor pinnacle of each sip I feel as if Im being trampled by an angry six foot croissant with icing and fangs. Monumental.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

The yellow nectar is pierced by a steady yet ultimately elegant bead of bubbles, wafting effortlessly towards heaven.  Glorious to gaze upon.  The aroma is a melange of sweet apples, butter, light brown sugar, peach cobbler, some vanilla and even a hint of pie spices.  The flavor is at first sweet, though not as syrupy as I expected.  The bubbles tease the palate, almost causing me to pause, wondering what is next.  Then the nectar is revealed.  Waves of apple sweetness, crisp acidity, a nice yeastiness.

Taste is, like all ice ciders, an explosion of apple flavor, but the aftertaste is a bit more alcoholic than usual, something Ive noticed in all ice ciders from Pinnacle, but with a twist.  This one felt almost like a kirsch, with a definite Bing cherry feel coming down.  Like all ice ciders, it goes down wickedly well, has an intense sweetness but not one you get sick of too quickly.
