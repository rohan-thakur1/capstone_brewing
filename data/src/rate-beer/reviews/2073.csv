2073,"2017-01-10",2.9,"Not terrible but nothing I would try again. Aroma was not really good. It had some weird stale beer/dirty dishwater smell. I did have it on draft so I cant know how clean the lines were. They do have 24 taps with 16 of them being craft beer so its not a place that doesnt know how to serve good beer. Pour was beautiful. Im a sucker for red beer and this beer was a dark ruby with one finger off white head. Taste was better than the aroma. Plums and other dark fruits were sweet in the beginning and provided a slight tartness in the finish. Mild carbonation.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
2073,"2016-12-26",3.3,"2015 version (drank Christmas 2016) Dark rust colored. Medium carbonation. A nice fruity aroma with clear notes of black currants, the cherries a bit lighter, but still identifiable. Didnt get much plum, but it could be the other fruits just distracting from it. Has some wood notes, a bit of vanilla. Almost like berries and cream. Tastes quite dry, but fruity in the start. Has a clear berry taste, with a light acidity. Finishes with a bit too much wood. Has some minerality and a nagging alcohol flavor. Was a bit let down, to be honest, but not a bad beer.","","AaronTDubs"

Aftertaste shows the cherry and fruitcake way up front with a little grain and alcohol behind. Overall, a good beer, but a bit too fruit-centric without enough complexity or the style and especially the time o year.

Pours lightly hazy/cloudy reddish orange color with a 1 finger fairly dense light pink head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of sweet black cherry, currant, plum, red grape, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness, light pepper, light oak/vanilla, herbal, floral, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity fruity/earthy yeast, dark fruits, and dark/bready malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of sweet black cherry, currant, plum, red grape, pear, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness, light pepper, light oak/vanilla, herbal, floral, and yeast/toasted earthiness.

Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, dark fruits, and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spice/tartness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from yeast/hop spice and fruit tartness as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, lightly creamy/bready, and crisp/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice Biere de Garde style. All around good complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast, dark fruits, and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink for the ABV. Certainly unique with the lightly tart fruit additions, but the base flavors were very true to style. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Aroma features yeasty, dark fruit and malty tones riding atop a hint of woody spice - did I get a hint of cedar, or of oak? Dark fruit - plums (not sugarplums, tho) and currants - is the dominant player in the delightful flavor, while woody, malty and yeasty tones provide the backup voices, so to speak. And drink.
