2924,"2016-05-31",3.5,"Bought at the domain. A luxury cuvée in which Dupont aims to emulate the vinous character of a champaign while using apples as fermentable sugars base. It makes for a subtle aroma, with chalky, dusty, bone-like apples with no residual sugars left and surprising minerality. Extremely dry, but not so acidic flavor profile, chalky, mineral, woodsy, finely bubbled. It is a refreshing bottle which serves a purpose on the table as a friend to lobster among other things, but not something I would frequently want to drink on its own. Fairly refined, but not very complex nor apple-forward. An interesting creation, but not as charming to me as many of the other Dupont experiments.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2924,"2016-05-03",3.9,"side by side tasting of Cuvée Colette with the Triple. Both more refermented and drier than all other available ciders.

In general, the longer fermentation makes both the CC and Triple drier and less sweet than the ""regular"" versions. Nonetheless still outstanding. Cuvée Colette really has a champagne touch to it, very dry ""zéro dosé"" dry, soft dry sherry notes, pinot meunier alike. The triple plays on the bitterness and tannins (and ""non-dégorgé"").

Golden yellow colour.
Nose: Lovely perfumed and vinous nose, rich and rather deep yellow and red apple notes.
Palate: Dry but with a sweet fruit note. Together with the maturity of the fruit this rounds the wine off and gives it an almost off-dry mouthfeel. Nice and rounded acidity balances the whole thing out. Quite rich mouthfeel. Rich mousse/carbonation. 
Mature and drinking very well now but seems to have enough fruit and acidity to last and potentially develop for another 2-4 years.","Lillestrøm, NORWAY","NORSAND"

2924,"2008-08-21",3.8,"Pours with a nice, fizzy, almost champagne level of carbonation.  The head is a pale, just off-white color and the cider is a nice, brilliantly clear gold color.  The carbonation makes an expressive, aromatic, apple note quite noticeable as I am pouring this cider.  This smells of fresh, aromatic apples that are backed by a bit of flinty yeast and a touch of alcohol towards the end.

Fairly sweet tasting, though not sticky in any way and there seems to be a touch of butter to the finish (seems to be a bit of diacetyl, though it can be hard to pick out at times from underneath all of the fruit notes).  The carbonation provides a nice, almost peppery note and there is perhaps a touch of spicy notes that also help to balance the up front sweetness.  Lightly tart tasting throughout the flavor profile, which also helps to provide some balance.  This is quite aromatic in its apple flavors / character, almost floral in a sweet nectar sort of manner.  Definitely very apple like, though not in a simplistic Red Delicious way, instead it has a complex, aromatic apple character that is quite refreshing and quite tasty.  This has a substantial level of tannin to it as well, which really helps with not only the texture, but also the complexity and balance of this brew.

This is definitely a great example of a cider that captures the apple character quite well.  I’ll admit to preferring the funkier and drier examples, but this one is certainly no slouch and is very enjoyable.  Even the diacetyl note that is softly in the finish of the flavor is not able to detract very much here.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2924,"2008-08-06",3.6,"Bottle courtesy of Immy at the Williamsburg Gathering. 750mL corked and caged. Hazy golden pour. Lots of bubble strands throughout the body and a short fizzy white head, Nose is candy apple, apple skins, green apple and some yeasty/funky notes. Some wet wood begins to come through as well. Taste is sweet apple, some soft candyish notes, more green apple and apple skins along with funky yeast flavors. It was mentioned that this tasted like ""cheap champagne"" at one point, though I disagree with that synopsis. Body was very light and fizzy. Crisp at times and dry. Ended with more sweet apple, green apple, soft spice and more funky yeast. Nice!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"

Chardonnay or champagne like in flavor as well, but not quite so dry. Good, great with a goat cheese.  Not as sweet (as thus not as good for someone with a sweet tooth like me) as an ice cider.

Wonderful - great mouthfeel and a wonderful swee/tart finish.  Absolutely great how a wonderful apple varietal mix comes together and produces a knockout - much like those fine Bordeaux wine blends.

2924,"2008-02-02",4.5,"Boboski hooks it up again.  Ciders are something I have truly come to adore and actively seek out, and this one is up there as one of my all time favorites.  The cider pours a perfectly crystalline color, with a fine bead of bubbles wafting upwards vigorously.  The aroma is beguiling, complex and almost otherworldly.  The fusion of Earth and orchard are evident.  Hints of wood, vanilla, acidic apples, floral notes, hints of citrus zests and a touch of alcohol to balance everything nicely.  The flavor is an epiphany, With a dry apple note to start everything off in the right direction, with the wood balancing the mid-notes, the close is a delicate and graceful acidity, pulling everything together.  Absolute a stunning creation and worthy of further praise.","Saint Cloud, Florida, USA","CheesedMan"

Tasty fine.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

Pours a bright, bold gold with very tiny bubbles seeming to struggle to get to the surface leaving a sustained white ring around the flute. Tart, slightly acidic with only a bit of residual sugar sweetness. Again, new oak, plenty of apple must and dry apple skin. Ultra fine carbonation doesnt distract one bit.

2924,"2007-11-25",4.3,"2004, released in 07, consumed fresh. Wow, wow, wow! I have enjoyed Louis Duponts creations for years, but this is an achievement I was not prepared to encounter. Completely crystalline, sparkling pour with a nearly negligible amount of visible, microscopic bubbles in near stasis that gradually glide to the top and keep a ring of white foam sustained at the edge of the glass. Were this poured into a proper flute, as evidenced in successive pours into other glasses, this would have generated and sustained a lovely foamy topper. The body is an extremely beautiful light gold; in fact, very rarely is this color a shade so beautiful or worthy of such verbose praise. Must escapes from the vessel first, followed quickly by easily separable multiple apple varieties, very clean and lively. Residual sugars are sparse but when encountered become dazzling and boisterous. Oak and vanilla are mild and candied/tar, yeast is nearly completely transparent. Alcohol is only very mildly detectable and is not bothersome. This has an absolutely fantastic nose! Clean and crisp but inundated and blanketed with cellaring effects that lay out like a panoramic photograph with tangibly explained intricacies. Short version: I feel the aroma. Complexity is midrange but several doses offer multiple alluring apple scents and easygoing earthy collaboration. The flavor is just as focused but remains so drinkable its nearly absurd. Apple has a constant of oak riding its tailwinds but never interfering with the fruit itself, or its intent of cleansing and refreshing the palate. Acidity is light to medium and only serves to sway astringency away from the most sensistive parts of the tongue. Sweetness swirls about and fades into a delicate, earthy and clean finish. The finale is one of awe-inspiring cleanness, huge but silky soft, with only a whisper of tartness and full diminishment of sugars leaving only light dryness and then oak and yeast, and then...nothing. Amazing. The mouthfeel is soft and light bodied that brushes with fuller moments. This is like a pure element(apple) being confronted with another angry dissident(earthy, cellar influence). Purity crushes the intruder with one swift blow. Wow, wow, wow!","Alabama, USA","boboski"
2924,"2007-11-18",4.2,"Pours a crystal clear, light golden body.  Microscopic carbonation bubbles soar to the surface where they pool into a tiny, fizzy, white head.  The aroma shows a beautiful bouquet of tart green and sweet red apples. The flavor is the same.  This is not an overly complex cider, but its sugar levels are near perfect, lending to a wonderful balance between sweet and tart.  Incredibly fresh tasting.  Flavors are concentrated and bright.  The tasty finish is moderately dry.  Perfect carbonation. Incredibly drinkable.  This might be my Christmas morning drink of choice.  Awesome cider!","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
2924,"2007-11-18",4.1,"First rating for this beer!  Pours a lovely, bubbly, crystal clear gold, with a tiny bubbly head.  Huge apple aroma, alot of sweet citrus notes, and maybe a touch of some earthiness to it.  The apple really is the dominating smell though.  The flavor is really well balanced.  Carbonation seemed about right, and the apple flavor wasnt overdone like it can be in other ciders.  Big finish, not too dry, and really flavorful.  Pretty damn kick ass cider.  Pricey as hell, but really glad I got to try this one.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
