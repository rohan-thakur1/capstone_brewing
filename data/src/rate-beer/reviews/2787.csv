2787,"2010-11-03",3.4,"Clear amber coloured brew with a good lasting and laceing head on its top.
Smell is of caramell, fruits and spice.
Tasteing begins with a nicely slick mouthfeel, the malty aroma brings caramell and grass along.
Flavour is of fruits, caramell and spice.
The fine finish is nutty and spicy, which drains the palate and remain in a fruity-spicy aftertaste.
Well balanced and drinkable. Enjoyable one.","Budapest, HUNGARY","inbirraveritas"
