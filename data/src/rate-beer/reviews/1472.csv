The nose furnishes luxuriant, interwoven notes of chocolate crème, vanilla, toasted coconut and cinnamon. Full-bodied and velvety with lazy carbonation. The flavor is sweet, creamy and decadent - vanilla, smooth liquor, toasty notes and cinnamon. No more than a smidge of chocolatiness in the flavor. Sweet, toasted coconut finish with alcohol warmth that lingers on and on. Awesome stuff. A sipper for sure. Smooth as a babys bottom. No rough edges at all.

As a previous rater said its reminiscent of an older dark lord, but with some bourbon aging. Not really getting the cherries at all. Flavour is heavy sweet but not as far as cloying.

Thick and chewy. Sweet as you would expect from the guys who brought you Black Tuesday and dark lord. Might be too many flavors in there. Bourbon chocolate coffee cherries. Its like a sundae with every topping.

750 bottle green label. After trying this from the bottle, it is definitely the one that was on tap at DLD.  Smell is bourbon and dark fruit.   Taste is a lot of chocolate covered cherries. Some sweetness and a touch of tart cherry.  Has a hint of vanilla. Slight bourbon with a touch of warming on the back end.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"

Pretty much perfect for me.","New York, New York, USA","charule"
1472,"2014-05-17",3.6,"Draft on tap at Dark Lord Day 2014 (Munster, IN). Been waiting to put this in because I was a bit confused the day of and after as to where it belonged. This makes things much more clear. Pours a deep blackish opaque hue, darker body shows just a touch of brownish glow on the edges and bottom. Cakey brownish head atop stays as a decent layer, ok stick around and lacing overall. Aromas are a bit fuzzy and oaky, firm tannic presence shows bourbon, wet wood and spirit mixing with decent roast, toast, touches of cherryskin and dark fruit. Subtle coffee, smooth vanillin elements. Initial is a bit on the heavier end of medium bodied, a touch prickly and firmly tannic perhaps a bit overbarreled. Cherryskin, wet wood and Bourbon seem to set the pace, a bit dry and roasty as we keep pressing. The smoothed out vanilla in the middle is a bit creamy, but still quite dry and tannic for the beer overall. Elements of roast, dryness, tannic wet oak into the backend still set the pace. Touches of dark fruit, mellow cherry and vanilla bean, touches of dark black coffee, faint cocoa nib and biscuits, caramel are there. The beer itself seems well barreled, a bit down in body overall with a firm barrel presence. I wouldnt call it hot, but it does feel dry overall. A solid offering.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
