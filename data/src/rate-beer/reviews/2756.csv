2756,"2016-12-27",3.1,"Keg at the brewery. Light amber, clear and thin looking. Quite a bit of head initially. Malty, citrus and floral - almost perfumed - odour. Sweet taste with bitter astringency leading up to the long finish. Notes of vanilla and tangerine in the aftertaste. Pretty good although balance doesnt quite work for me.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","jjsint"

Medium to full-bodied with a whole-milk mouthfeel and buzzing carbonation. The flavor is that of a hopped-up amber ale  toasted, crunchy malts intertwined with spicy lupulin bitterness.
