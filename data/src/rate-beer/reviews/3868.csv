3868,"2017-06-14",4.2,"Flight at the source during ck1s birthday trip. Unclear yellower-than-orange-juice pour, as true to the NE IPA style. Fruity. Citrus. Somewhat an orange juicy sour/tart component. Excellent flavor. Tangy which is just slightly off-putting at times. Very, very good. 17","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"

Medium body. Oily texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt, juicy, pulpy finish. (Feel - 4.00)

3868,"2017-03-19",4.4,"Fresh crowler from weldworks 2nd anniversary party. Pour is a super thick and hazy golden orange with a nice white head that leaves excellent lacing. Aroma is loaded with citrus and tropical fruit. Oranges, mango, passion fruit, tangerine, and more oranges. Taste is orange juice, grapefruit, and tropical fruit salad. Its seriously orange juice beer. Creamy, juicy, and velvety with a juicy and quenching finish. Outstanding.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Thechasm442"
3868,"2017-03-16",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed on draft at Hunahpus Day 2017 on March 11. The pour is a dark yellow orange color with a thicker white head that falls down pretty quickly with a little bit of a soapy lace left behind. The aroma is pretty good. There is a lot of juicy hop right up front. There isnt as much juiciness as I would expect, but its good. There is a leafiness to the hop as well, that helps come off a little bitter. There is a bit of tropical fruit, and no malt, which I do like. The flavor is just the same. There is a huge juiciness right up front before it falls into a hint of bitter with the leafy hop and a light bit of pine on the finish. The mouth feel is light and clean with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly juicy and hoppy finish. This is really clean and nice. Its all citrus. Well done.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3868,"2017-02-10",3.8,"32 ounce crowler picked up at the brewery earlier today for $12. Hazy orange appearance with an off white head. Aroma has some spice, especially onion, and a bunch of tropical fruit like mangos, oranges, and pineapple. A little chunky with some bready notes. Moderate to moderate plus bitterness. Off dry. Lots of fruit and an enjoyable flavor but the bitterness is a bit high. Tough to say if its worth $12/32oz growler but it is an enjoyable beer.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"

The aroma features a medley of tropical fruits and melons with a modest ration of citrus fruit. Plenty of biscuity malts here as well. Medium-bodied with lazy carbonation. The flavor features a bittersweet collection of tropical fruits - mango, dragon fruit and guanabana with a touch of honeydew melon. Bittersweet, tropical fruit finish. More sweet than bitter.

3868,"2016-05-10",4.1,"Pours a completely hazed multifruit juice orange color, with a big, fluffy head.

Smells of a floral, luscious fruitiness, of oranges entangled into a hint of papaya and peach, which gets topped off by a whiff of lemon peel. The aromas create a heavenly blend of exotic fruits, tied together by a dank water melon quality, creating a beautiful nose.

Drinks very smooth and refreshing, with a medium carbonation caressing the tongue. Soft till the finish, with a nice squeeze of lemon blending into the soft carbonation, making this awesomely great for warm weather. 

Tastes of mellow, wet grass coated orange pulp, with peach and lemon amping up the dominant fruitiness. More lemon becomes apparent before the swallow, gently soothed by the creamy mouthfeel, featuring a juicy orange flavor till the end. Fruits blend into a part white bread dough, part toffee malt foundation, which adds to their juicy appearance. Finishes with a nice lemony dry note, while the fruits remain on the palate till the end. 

Fantastic, fruity, juicy IPA reminding me a lot of Julius with just a tad more lemon zing during the finish, while producing the same world class mouthfeel and fruitiness.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Fruity pebbles and juicy fruit gum come to mind. Fresh, awesome IPA overall.
