Wet, soapy globs change shape as they glide down the glass, returning home to the body from which they came.  Aromas are based in the requisite doughy malt, showing notes of baking bread and caramelized marshmallow, and giving some fruity, browned banana sweetness.

2226,"2010-09-09",3.8,"With the kickoff of the NFL season tonight combined with some drizzling rain conditions, I went in search of the perfect ""rainy night football beer.""  I was pleasantly surprised to find Boulevards Bob 47 on the shelf at my local liquor shop.  

12 ounce stubby bottle.  Porus a deep burnished orange with a light tan head with a solid half inch of retention.  Nice levels of carbonation are apparent in my glass.  Light notes of honey nut cheerios up front along with the smell of lightly skunky lager yeast.  Is this thing a lager?  Guess I should have actually read the bottle.  If it is a lager its surprisingly dark, as the color borders on amber.  Smell is average at best, was hoping for more malt but the aroma just isnt there.  Medium mouthfeel, light carbonation is present in the body of the beer.  Kind of sticky, but not overly so.  I find this beer coating the roof of my mouth more than others in the style.  Not as watery as I had anticipated.  Good malt body in this beer, much moreso than the aroma would lead you to believe.  Theres a nice mix of caramel sweetness and hop bitterness in the finish of the beer.  If youre a hop head youll find the hops about 2/3rds of the way through drinking the beer.  Brown sugar malt sweetness greets the palate, introduces itself, before moving out of the way for the hops.  The hops stay briefly and then youre left with more malt sweetness and some mild hop bitterness.  Its actually a very well balanced beer and also very easy drinking stuff.  Could benefit from a bit more in the taste department; the entire beer is rather subdued and while the mouthfeel isnt watery the taste feels like it could be pushed up a couple of degrees without sacrificing anything.  Overall though a decent brew and exactly what I was looking for tonight to keep me company.",", Missouri, USA","VengefulOdin"

Most of the details of the previous rate still seem about right, but with a slightly fresh example it feels a bit fuller in flavor, a bit more of a satisfying experience overall.

Previous rating: Bottle, picked up at Johns Grocery in Iowa City, IA. Opened with Tom at the ""What this town needs is an IHOP"" tasting. Glowing orange, small off-white layer of head. Fresh lager malt nose, touch of noble hops, a little puffed wheat. Very light and rather dry flavor, just a touch of grassy hops. Short finish with just a little lingering mint.

Carbonation on this bottle is quite fine, and works nicely to help lighten the malt. Other bottles from this six pack have had a strangely large-bubbled soda-like carbonation. Talking to other BAs about this years edition, this bottle seems more representative.

Always one of my favorite seasonals, and a perfect complement to a football Saturday (or Sunday if you swing the NFL way). Well done, Boulevard - lets have it back on draft next year so my kegerator will be happy!

It pours a clear light caramel, like a light tea, with a loose, frothy, beige head. The aroma is a bit muted but quite clean with notes of bready, sweet malt and grassy hops. Light-bodied and slick, the mouthfeel is lively and finishes mildly bitter. The flavor profile is fairly simple with round caramel malts and earthy hops, but this is a very balanced beer. Relatively simple but quite satisfying, this is one of the better lagers (of any style) that Ive sampled. It is a truly rare lager in that it actually gets better as you get deeper into the glass.

2226,"2005-11-20",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 21, 2005 2005 (I assume) bottle from Herbjones.  Awesome choice Bob!  Consumed on 11/12/05.  Dont think its quite as dark as made out to be, more of a coppery-amber with some rusty tinges.  Foamy, persistent white head is well retained and provides even spotty lacing.  Clear and I believe, bottle conditioned?  Aroma has a little bite of crisp lager yeast, with a touch of saazy sweatiness, hint of dry lemon-peel-like notes (no actual lemon peel in there), and a bit of sweet biscuity pale grains.  Fresh minerals and a bit of lightly baked white dough.  Flavor begins with a light sourdough feel, light minerals and a persistent touch of saaz hops on the end.  Dry and argumentative peach, apricot and nectarine notes keep the palate busy while only a smattering of sweet honey is felt as well.  Carbonation is quite persistent, creating a very foamy/over-aerated texture (but to its defense, I drank this too warm).  Medium body is ample.  Could stand some more hop bitterness.  Theres a blurry line between a helles and a premium lager and this straddles it.  Whatever the case, all areas of the beer are well-executed.  Yeast retains a mineralesque and yet also a lightly biting feel well on to the end of the bottle.  No alcohol apparency anywhere.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The aroma was my favorite part of the beer; cloves, dry grass/wheat, lemon, floral, pepper/spices.  The mouthfeel was quite dry and carbonated with abite at the finish.  The flkavors were light on standard malty/hoppy themes, but lots of undertones ranging from citrus/apples/floral to toffee/malted/roasted/smokey.

I got a HEAVY dose of citrus and grapefruit, orange and grapefruit peel, raisins, plums, malt, and some other dark fruits. Lets begin by saying that Im not a huge fan of grapefruits and dark fruits in the most part. The beer, may I also add, had a very nice carbonation tornado swirling in the center...bonus points for that...and therefore heavily carbonated. The flavor is challenging and at some points offensive, especially as it warmed. I got a heavy dose of citrus, banana and grapefruit with a hint of pine, malt, cardboard and raisins. It ends malty and very dry with a heavy degree of syrupy carbonation. Thin to medium mouthfeel, extremely fruity...banana and grapefruit domination. Some serious lack of balance here...I can see where some would like this...but it seems to me like a ""like it or leave it"" beer...

Aroma is toffeeish, nutty, caramel dipped toasted edging; warming, clean, and soft with an overall sweet malt tone. Quite nice actually.

Taste is malty smooth, akin to becoming dopplebock-like but keeps a slight toastier edge and slight herbal hop backing to it. Mostly sweet with a light mixure of bready malts and caramel smoothness, lifting into some retracting toffee butter and nuts. Finish lends a bit of hoppy herbal grassy atop a slight roasty/toasty chewy malt.

Feel is silky smooth and malty thick, nearly full and buttery, not too cloying in sweetness but definately has a hangin around-sticky thing to its character and body. A pleasant surprise as it slides right down. This is a keeper by the folks at Boulevard.

I love Boulevard beers, so it pains me to ask why this beer is ranked in the 89th percentile. I havent had the beer for a couple years but decided to buy a six-pack after this score. It is nice and very good for a lager, but this type of beer isnt my favorite. 6/3/7/3/14
RE-RATE I got one of the first six packs in town of the 2007 version. The more I drink, the more I am reminded that this type of beer is subtle and may not scream out to you, but is nice just the same. Toasty, malt driven aroma, with some subtle earthy hops. Taste is malty with a melanoidin-rich and toasty flavor. Hops take a back seat to the malt, but do add a bit of nice flavor as well as the requisite bitterness that makes the beer very drinkable. I think I was a little harsh on this beer at first, but it had a hard time sticking out against all the IPAs, Imperial Stouts, and the like. Time has given me an appreciation of the more elegant, subtle beers.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

2226,"2004-10-16",4.1,"Bottle. Deep amber with a creamy, quickly diminishing head. Subdued, very fine bubbled carboation.  Aroma has a backbone of caramel malts, but has lots else to offer, including cider apples and spices with a little grassiness. Whatever strain of lager yeast they use, it has lots more flavors going on than a normal pilsner strain. Flavors remind me of fall, with a caramel appleness(actually a slighty scorched toffee apple) and enough hop character to balance it out, something not always found in malt forward lagers. Dry, give me more to drink finish. Mucho complexities.  While I dont drink a lot of lagers, this is one of the best, if not the best, Ive ever had. An ale lovers lager.

Appearance isn't piss-yellow but rather a darker, more amberish color that is quite appealing. The taste is malty and slightly bitter with enough complexity to keep me interested.

Not sure on the freshness of this bottle. Simple malt flavors.  Somewhere between a vienna and an american amber.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

2226,"2002-11-27",3.7,"Very malty tasting with just enough hops to balance it out. Very thick-tasting flavor. Smells like barley but little else. Overall not that impressive but refreshing and certainly not to be turned down.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"
2226,"2002-11-27",4.2,"One of the most complex malt aromas Ive ever encountered in a non-bock lager.  A great underpinning of hops, too.  Beautifully layered complex sweet malt with long, unfolding flavor and ending with a gorgeous long dry finish.  Wow.  I cant believe how fine a job this ale brewery did with this lager.  Simply wonderful.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"
2226,"2002-11-26",3.8,"Surprisingly good - rich and malty with brown sugar tones.  A nice warm taste, slight spice in the aftertaste.","Lewis Center, Ohio, USA","bluemeow76"
2226,"2002-11-25",3.7,"Thanks to hey_kevin for this one. This was a decent Amber Lager with a dark amber color and thin off-white head. No real lacing to speak of. Rich caramel malt aroma. Rather strong malt flavor with a nice finish. Not bad at all.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
2226,"2002-11-19",3.9,"I really dig this style of beer. Finally, I believe Ive found my niche in the beer world (outside of Belgian ales of course)","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
2226,"2002-11-02",3.6,"Not a bad lager, but nothing special.  It has a bit too much alcohol in the aroma, and the taste is just a generic lager flavor.  Better than Heinies, Leinies, or Sam, though, and usally cheaper.  If you like plain-jane functional lager this one would be a good bet.","Le Mars, Iowa, USA","bbrock81"
2226,"2002-10-18",3.9,"The first whiff had me wondering, but true to fashion, boulevard settled any doubts, its a fine lager.Crisp and not imposing, I wish I had some pizza.","Little Rock, Arkansas, USA","MeSoSnobby"
2226,"2002-10-08",4.1,"This beer is not a munich dunkel, it is, however an excellent amber lager.  Sharp tight noble hop aroma.  Clear amber in color.  Flavor hits your taste buds with a whack of sharp clean maltiness finishing nicely with tongue drying hops.  This is an excellent fall lager.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"

2226,"2002-09-13",4.1,"A very nice beer from Boulevard.  Smells hoppy, toasty, warm and lasting mouthfeel, great red/amber color.  Very nicely done.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sethdude"
2226,"2002-01-15",4.0,"Strong, warming, complex with an all out charge of robust malts trailing flags of hops and toastiness across the senses.  Good stuff!","USA","lagerman99"
2226,"2001-12-17",3.4,"I am not sure if I was drunk when I rated this last or not, but I see this beer in a complete diff light now.  There is nothing impressive about this Munich style beer.  The after taste is some kind of metal/plastic flavor and it just does not sit right in my stomach.  I love KC and Boulevard, but this needs to be changed.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","MOboy"
2226,"2001-11-04",4.1,"Extremely well-made and finely balanced. Rich, malty, nutty, with a caramel-roasted goodness. Smooth and flavorful. Similar to an Oktoberfest style, but much better. More flavor, and more burntness.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
2226,"2001-10-25",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2006 This may be my last re-rate of this beer. As Ive noted in my prior reviews, this beer seems to have morphed from an obvious vienna-esque marzeny style to an American Dark (dont agree with the premium lager classification here - but then again we once classed it as a helles?!). Anyway, the 2006 bottles are out and I just got through 3 of the most enjoyable Bobs Ive had yet to date. Even if it isnt really very vienna-ish anymore, this is nevertheless a great amber lager. Big rounded smooth mouthfeel, complemented by caramel-toffee malt tones, and a pleasant swirling of grassy hop flavors. It all leads to an easy balanced finish. Well done, and one of the rare beers out there right now that I can drink in session form and not get bored.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
2226,"2001-10-19",4.5,"This has to be one of the best of the fine beverages that Boulevard produces. I hope this is not one of their seasonal beers. The taste was not to bitter, and not to sweet.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","chd456799"
2226,"2001-09-17",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2006 Aroma features some caramel and toffee sweetness and toasty, bready malt along with some very mild hop.  Medium-dark amber color with a subsiding head.  Malty and lightly sweet flavor, with some caramel, faint spiciness and briefly lingering hop bitterness.  Clean and smooth on the palate, medium bodied.  Highly drinkable.  My favorite batch in recent memory was the 2000, however it is pretty consistent from year to year.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
