1896,"2017-04-30",3.2,"4/30/2017 (12 fl oz bottle): Aroma has dried leaves, toasted malt, and earthy hops; hazy golden amber color with a fluffy off-white head of foam; flavor is much like the aroma and doesnt seem to offer much more (a bit of dried citrus and earthy caramel with a touch of dry cedar) until closer to the finish when the hoppiness kicks in (seems like Centennial long with something with some pine and grassy notes); medium body, soft carbonation and mouthfeel; good, but mostly forgettable, tastes a lot like some recent Goose Island offerings and reminds me more of a slightly hoppy amber ale.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"
1896,"2017-04-20",3.5,"Fresh 12 oz bottle in SC.

Clear amber body thats topped by a creamy, durable off-white head. Excellent lacing.

Aroma: citrus and biscuits. 

Flavor: more malt presence than expected but the hops eventually dominate the aftertaste. 

Feel: soft medium+ carbonation and smooth, light body. Dry finish. Nice but a bit too thin. 

Overall: a fine APA","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
1896,"2017-04-03",3.4,"Amber, 1/2 inch tan head, floral aroma. 12 ounce bottle with no stamped date. English ale profile, moderate bitterness, some caramel and citrus. A little thin, but it goes down smooth and easy. Enjoy it.","Georgia, USA","Bufordbrewer"
1896,"2017-03-11",3.6,"Bottle with no decipherable date info into a pint.
A: Poured a deep rich orange amber with short thick tan head. Sparse carbonation. Very good retention and thick lace.
S: Nice sweet/tart caramel and orange aroma. 
T: Citrusy orange and leafy hop flavors with medium bitterness. Dry caramel, wood and bread malt notes provide good balance without too much sweetness. 
M: Light medium body with fizzy carb tingle. Finishes clean and dry.
O: Nice all around and not as malty as expected. The hops still shine through nicely. Well worth a buy when in season. Points though for no dating.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","malvrich"
1896,"2016-04-05",3.4,"Not generally a fan of English style pales, this was done well. a touch malty for me, but the uniquely melon nose and flavor of the hops was a nice touch.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
1896,"2016-03-23",3.0,"Pour is a clear copper with a large white head. Aroma is a floral hop and some sweet malt. Flavor is more of the English malt with a minor hop. Finish is a little bitter and not as sweet as I thought it would be. This was ok a bit more hop presence would have been nice.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
1896,"2016-03-17",3.8,"On tap at Green Man. Tropcial fruit aroma, not like what I was expecting from an ""English"" pale ale. Pleasant fruity and malty taste, with a touch of ash.","Waterloo, Ontario, CANADA","kevinsenn"

1896,"2015-05-24",3.3,"Pours clear amber with a fairly thick and creamy eggshell head. Malty aroma has hoppy and subtle fruity notes. Flavor has form malty and hoppy tones plus an underpinning of slightly sour apple. Mouthfeel has decent body and fizz, leaving a malty and slightly hoppy finish. Ramble to Green Man and ask for a glass.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
1896,"2015-05-01",3.5,"This beer is a rebel. It is great when its warm out. A good light pale ale and has a definite dry finish.","North Carolina, USA","aumentm"
1896,"2015-04-27",3.4,"Orange, smooth white head. Smells kind of citrusy, plus some caramel and brown sugar. Taste is mildly earthy, then some toast and citrus. Woody finish. Not bad...","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
1896,"2015-04-25",3.6,"bottle shared poured bright orange with white head and decent lacing. nice malt aroma backed up by the hops. the flavor is more of the same sharp and crisp hop flavor blended with the malts and makes a very nice spring flavored beer.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","tmongoose"
1896,"2015-04-09",3.6,"Sample at Bad Parenting Club (plus a few dirty aunt/uncles?!): NC Beer Edition on 03/28/2015. The beer is a clear copper color with a medium thin bone white head that dissipates steadily to an outer ring. Short strings of lacing. Aroma of pine, hops and malt. Light-bodied with flavors of herbal hops, pine and toasted malt. The finish is mildly bitter with a piney hops aftertaste. Decent overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
1896,"2015-03-29",4.0,"Wow. What a great spring beer. Light and crisp with a great floral aroma, a citrus and bready finish and a wonderful sweetness.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","ads135"
1896,"2015-03-26",4.4,"It first I wasn't too impressed with an average appearance and mild aroma, but the flavor and body more than make up for that. Excellent hop and malt flavor very good balance. Wish I had more of this one.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"
1896,"2014-04-27",3.3,"Bottle. Gold in color with a medium head. Aroma is floral, citrus. Taste is spurce, citrus floral.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","tnkw01"
1896,"2014-04-16",3.6,"Bottle. Pours a copper color with white head. Biscuit, caramel, citrus, earthy aromas. Grassy, green hop, earthy, bitter flavors. Pretty tasty.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","jcnielsen"
1896,"2014-03-28",3.6,"12 oz. Clear amber-copper pour with a small disc of cream on top. Big aroma of resiny green herb, dark toast and some underlying orange toffee. Tastes of resin, ashy residue from a green herb, and a touch of sourish orange toffee. Light-medium body is a little too fizzy. Dry with a fairly large hop presence and some slight astringency. Sessionable and tasty bastardization of the pale ale styles, although if pressed Id say its more of an APA.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
1896,"2014-03-21",3.7,"Pours a soft but pretty clean amber hued gold with one finger of sticky off yellow head. The nose is pretty intensely hoppy, very leafy and green aromatics with subtle citrusy, spicy, and piney notes. A subtle and fruity sweetness follows the back of the aroma. Very strong hop presence in the flavor. Very fresh and green hop character with some overt fruity tones and earthy malt profile. Very dry and pretty bitter.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
