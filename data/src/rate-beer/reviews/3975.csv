Had been wanting to pick up this Stone 20th Anniversary 4-pack and finally saw it for the first time at Costco for $19.99. Done. Kind of looking forward to this Black IPA, which I have a kind of an affinity for. 

Poured a pitch black color with khaki tan frothy head. Serene setting underneath. Excellent uneven foamy lacing. World-class retention. (Sight - 4.25)

Smelled a nice mix of roasted malts and hops. Got chocolate, cocoa, espresso, caramel, toast, mandarin orange, mango, papaya and other tropical notes. Really getting Orange Chocolate Sees Candy. Nice. (Smell - 4.00)

More malty on the tongue than the nose. Got chocolate, dark cocoa powder, roasty coffee beans, bitter char wood, dark fruits, purple grape, mandarin orange (not as potent as the nose), red grapefruit, stone fruit, hints of bitter mango rind, papaya and some other tropical notes. And 10.8 pct. ABV, are you serious Clark? (Taste - 4.25)

Medium-to-full body. Creamy texture. Average-to-soft carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.25)

Really liked this one, even growing on me as it went down. This was my favorite of the 5th-10th-15th series, and only trailing Citracado out of the four. Lovely. (Overall - 4.25)

3975,"2016-10-25",4.2,"I was glad to get a chance to try this at Stones taproom in Richmond, and I was curious to see if Id find it to be different from Sublimely Self Righteous, the regular release version of this recipe. Maybe some of it was in my head, but I thought this beer was quite different from SSR. I liked it enough to bring home a crowler, and thats what Im enjoying right now. This beer still pours brown with a thick, tan head and average carbonation. The aroma is still hop-forward, of course. Pine and grassy notes, but I didnt really think I picked up on the rye-like notes that I notice in SSR. The taste is where I really detected a difference. There is a rush of chocolate and coffee on the finish that I just do not get out of SSR, and its delicious. Really wonderful. Hops in the nose, hops on the front of the tongue, and then sweet, rich smoothness at the end. As much as I love Sublimely, I do like this more.

The aroma is roasted malt, citrus, pine hops, and spicy. The flavor is heavily bitter, citrus fruits, pine hops and roasted malt. The mouthfeel is aggressive and lively. This beer is medium bodied. The hops are upfront in this beer but not over-the-top. There is a lingering roasty aftertaste to this beer.

Was looking for something to tear me up this morning to expedite nocturne. 

A: Heavy pour produces two fingers of dark mocha head atop a black ale. The head falls rather slowly to a firm quilt of the same. Sheet lacing. Damn good looking beer.

S: Pine cones, grapefruit, cinnamon, coffee grounds, marzipan (?), hints of smoked oak. Really thoughtful as a ABA (much less Impy). When I smell this, I keep expected some molasses to come through, but much to my satisfaction, it does not - it would have tipped the scale too much one way. Right now, this beer is exceptionally balanced in my olfactory.

T: Sharp, dull, sweet and bitter all at once. Very complex flavor here. Coffee grounds, bitter cocoa, roasted almonds, hints of licorice, resin and piny hops, grapefruit rinds. Really nice battle for attention going on over the palate.

M: Creamy and heavy with velveteen carbonation. Finish is long and viscous. Really pleasant.

O: Greg and the boys are firing on all cylinders with this one. Damn fine beer which pushes the limits of a still young genre. They have had one of the longest running in the style, its not surprising that they would spearhead the movement to imperialize on a national scale. Good shit. Seek out.

Black as could be, thin dark mocha head quickly dissipates, leaving a ring on the side. Slightly bubbly in carbonation.
""Fruity pepples"" fruity aroma with light undertones of smoked malts. The more I smell the more the smoke comes out of the beer.
Dominant, heavy chocolate notes on the back end, bitter than most black IPAs, yet still not reaching the stout bitterness level. High acidic taste in the middle of the gulp as it hits the roof of the mouth, then turns to a fruity bubbly on the way down.
Soft on the side of the mouth, almost warming sensation. Chocolate coats your entire mouth with bubbles in the center. Feels more like a stout for the style than most.
Would not guess over 10% abv. For style, it is leading the way for Black IPAs. I have not had SSR in a month or two but from memory Escondidian seems even lighter with more of a bubbly malt sensation to cure any over powering alcohol presence.","Bucktown, Ohio, USA","One2remeber"

3975,"2012-05-07",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
This well-woven Imperial Black IPA is chock-full of chocolate, bright coniferous hop resins and caramel angles, all in a lush, tight mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the darkness.
-Aromas and flavors are leveled throughout. There is also balance within the intensity.
-Effervescence is soft, which is perfect for the moderately high level of residual sugars.
-Alcohol heat is harmonious with the coniferous hops.
-Roasted malt flavors add depth, while never clashing with the rest of the flavor profile.

S: The best descriptor of the smell is chocolate-glazed grapefruit. Not the smoothest blend of flavors to me, but it does smell nice.

T: Starts with some subtle, roasty chocolate and coffee, while it finishes with a textbook grapefruit hop/slight booze finish. Not much in the way of pine notes, and in terms of booziness, it comes across like its 9%, rather than almost 11%. I was worried that the roast/chocolate wouldnt mix with the hop character, but my fears were assuaged. Excellent.

M: This doesnt have the sticky, palate killing finish like SOME Stone beers (cough Arrogant Bastard cough), which in this situation, is good. Nicely heavy-bodied, with high carbonation and a warming alcohol finish.

O: It was worth getting too drunk after drinking 2/3rds of this, throwing up half of my dinner an hour later, waking up with a solid hangover at 5:00 AM, and being completely sick of anything alcoholic for a couple days after having this. That is all.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

How: Bottle 22oz, a few times.  This rating for a bottle consumed 4 months after the beer release
The look: Black body topped by a large tan head with good retention
In long: Nose is quite hoppy (flowery, fresh grass and piney) with roast and candied fruits.  This doesnt smell like an 11% monster, smells like a smaller Black IPA.  Inviting nose but maybe a little too perfume-ish compared to the best of the style (including Stones own SSRA).  Taste is relatively smooth for a beer this type and especially of this gravity.  There is obviously a whole lot of malts with a bittersweet chocolate character that I would describe as chocolate cake icing, burnt grains, roasted coffee beans, some figs.  The usual suspects.  Assertive but not overwhelming grassy/piney/grapefruity bitterness.  Alcohol is not bothersome but not totally well hidden either.  So the obvious question here is: is the Stone 15th Anniversary just a cranked up version of the Stone Sublimely Self Righteous Ale?.  The answer is no.  Less fruity and more roasted/astringent than the SSR, and just overall different.  I much preferred the SSR but this is a very nice treat nonetheless.  And once again Stone printed a long long text on the back of the bottle that I read from beginning to end just to make sure that by drinking the bottle I dont unwillingly authorize Mickey Rourke to come and massage my feet while Im sleeping.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

3975,"2012-03-07",3.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 8/22/2011.  Served on tap in a snifter at the Stone Tap Takeover at Acre.

The appearance of every Stone beer shows their care and devotion to the craft. Black in color with brown edges and a tan cap, this big American Black Ale retains remarkably well for the ABV and leaves some nice lace down the glass.

The aroma is dark roasted malt, coffee, soy sauce, and some piney hops with a touch of ethyl alcohol.

Unfortunately, the taste cannot shed the soy sauce aroma that I got in the nose. Roast coffee and malt go well together with some light sweetness, with a mostly pine hop bill at the end. The salty soy sauce flavor just throws this off too much to give it a good score though. The booze is there the whole time, but it manifests itself in its purest form at the end of the sip.

Moderately creamy and smooth, with a good amount of carbonation. Fuller than medium bodied, with an ABV that warms the throat and stomach. Not too sticky or resiny, although both sensations are there.

Not the best I have had. Where that soy sauce flavor came from, I dont know, but it really distracts from what would otherwise be a pretty good beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Insanely rich, with massive hop flavor.  Not like the black IPAs that are hoppy for a dark beer...this beer is hoppy for an imperial IPA....but with that full body and rich roastiness you get from a darker beer...even finishing with some coffee and maybe a little bit of cocoa.

3975,"2012-02-26",3.9,"Bottle. The pour was a thick dark black with a large (2-3 finger) medium brown creamy head which had good retention reducing to a thick puddling thus creating some excellent sheets of lacing.

The aroma was of a pine hop, a roasted grain malt and a moldy yeast with notes of coffee, caramel, licorice, chocolate and a decent alcohol tinge.

The taste was a hoppy, malty and a tad sweet with a very mild hint of caramel and chocolate at first then progressed into a bitter, roasty, hoppy flavor with a big coffee note and a mild alcohol presence at the end. The flavor hung on for a good long time proceeding the swallow letting the hoppy roastiness settle in.

3975,"2012-01-31",4.5,"""-Purchased at Hunger Mountain Co-Op in Vermont. Paid $7
-Poured into a """"Perfect Pint"""" glass
-Bottled on August 2011
-Purchased January 6th
-Served at 48 Degrees F
A - Pours dark brown like light coffee. Completely dark letting no light through the pint glass. I poured it pretty aggressively and got 6 fingers head out of it. After 3 minutes, the head subsided to 1 finger and remained. This looks a lot like instant chocolate milk stirred into water. Very dark but not creamy at all.
S - Smells a lot like Stone / Alchemists """"More Black than Brown"""". I smell Heath bar and half & half. There are some nuts in here.. maybe pecan? Its a very hearty looking beer but smells really great. Lots of nice brown ale notes with the bite of an IPA.
T - It tastes a lot like the """"More Black than Brown IPA"""" but with a lot more IPA. More hop with great Stone bite of coffee and candy corns. I love the sweet aftertaste and smooth finish. After swallowing, I almost get a slight menthol note. 
M - If you hold this in your mouth, the center of your tongue will tingle a bit. Its a great feeling. The mouthfeel is right next to what a IPA should feel like. Loads of flavor but this isnt too bitter its nice, creamy carbonation but not a lot. Swishing it around doesnt do too much to it.
O - This i a fantastic beer. The label says to drink fresh and brewed in August, consumed in January is certainly not """"fresh"""" but I never would have had this had it not been the last bottle on a dusty shelf in a grocery store. Id love to have this bottle again. Delicious, perfect and it would be great knowing what this tasted like right after bottling.

I wanted to transcribe the label on the back of the bottle. Its hard to read and very long but, for posterity, its nice having it here because I really enjoyed straining my eyes to read it:

""""In the 15 years since we entered the craft brewing world, change has come not in a straight line, but as an exponential curve. The craft brewing movement has long been called a ârevolution.â But today the air is so thick with revolution, itâs palpable. No longer is it only an awareness among the faithful; the unconverted are beginning to feel it as well. Denial and ignorance are disappearing in favor of opened eyes, curiosity and the sense that thereâs something larger out there. For far too long we have been lied to. For far too long we have been oppressed by the notion that dumbed-down-lowest-common-denominator-mediocrity was all that we could, and should, expect. You might think weâre talking only about the world of brewing, but weâre not. There is a myriad of products out there masquerading as cheeses, coffee, chocolates, breadsâ¦hell, there is stuff pretending to be âfoodâ that our great grandmothers would not recognize as such. Yet the craft brewing movement, together with the artisanal food movement, is making much progress. Where the industrial companies canât dismiss or bury us, they are attempting to copy us with cheap facsimiles. Yes, chances are if you are holding this bottle, you understand these things to be true about the world of brewing. You also likely understand the importance of our fight at Stone against accepted ânormsâ over the last 15 years. We believed that America was ready to embrace things made with artistry and passion. You have spoken. Your response has been clear. We are not merely consumers to be spoon-fed whatever commodities need to be unloaded for a profit. We have only just begun to move the needle of this revolution, & mediocrity still reigns. Consider that when you reject dumbed down, industrialized food and drink, you also support craft brewing. The line is nearly seamless; we are fighting the same battle. We will not win in our lifetime, as the powers are too entrenched, and the masses too fooled. And shackled. However, this is a revolution of ideas and of taste, and we will win. How do you want to be viewed by your children, and your childrenâs children? As a hero, or as the oppressed? (Those that donât think they have been oppressed are already lost.) Ultimately, itâs up to you to decide. We hope youâll stand with us. Strong and unyielding. You are needed. This bottle and its glorious contents are a celebration of you, brothers and sisters, and your importance in this fight. Cheers to all weâve accomplished together in the past fifteen years, and cheers to the adventure ahead!""""""","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

3975,"2012-01-24",3.2,"From bomber into Green Man snifter. Pours as black as the name implies. Medium brown head that settles down pretty quickly, but leaves a dark, intermittent lag-lacing upon swirling. Aroma is some chocolate, some nail polish remover (alcohol). Some really beautiful whiskey (bourbon) flavor hits in the middle, although it is a pretty hot beer. Hops arent overwhelming; more like a match for this giant beer. On second sip, I think the hops may just be intertwined with the alcohol and contribute to a sense of greater heat. The bitterness is definitely felt in the finish. Overall, another (expectedly) bold entry from Stone, but Ill take their core beers over this one, any time.","California, USA","cmc619"

At first the smell reminded me of the sixpoint diesel which was very underwhelming, so perhaps my rating on this is prejudiced.  There is a malt smell and herbalness in the aroma which is off putting.  There are floral and citrus notes, but as I said, this is now a 6 month old IIPA.  Mouthfeel is excellent, medium full bodied and satiny.  Good roastiness and earthy hopiness but not overly bitter.  The malt helps overcome any faded stickiness and syrupy sweetness that a fading IIPA might display.

Lots more pine sap, a strong roasted grain backbone with chocolate malts and molasses.  A bit of grapefruit pith late swallow and a nice alcohol warming that lingers and tingles.

3975,"2011-12-22",4.0,"Location/Date:Bottle on December 22nd, 2011 to kick off four days off.
Appearance: Pours black with reddish brown head. 
Aroma: Aroma is of roasty malt, faint coffee, grass/herbal hops.
Taste: Medium bitterness that sticks out more on the finish, a bit of sweetness, and a whole lot of roastyness.
Palate:Full body, kind of creamy and slick, with a long finish.
Summary: This is my second time having this beer. I know black ipas are the ""hip thing"" right now, and Stone never fails in the IPA department...so this one lives up to it. Not an everyday beer, but definitely delicious.","Maryland, USA","jcos"
3975,"2011-12-21",4.0,"22oz. bottle, dated August 2011.  Aroma of piney, earthy, herbal hops, lightly roasty, chocolatey malts and very faint sweetness, with notes of cola, resin, faint citrus and licorice.  Black in color as advertised, with a lasting, fine, khaki head.  Flavor profile is massively hoppy to start, though this is offset rather nicely by the roasted, toasty, darkly sweet malts, and finishes with a hugely bitter hop punch, inducing a drying effect and blending with spicy, warming alcohol, faint coffee, pine and grapefruit.  Sharp, lightly effervescent and thick on the palate, body is full as can be.  No mistaking this for anything other than what it is, a huge West Coast-style Double IPA with a hefty dosage of dark malts to boot.

3975,"2011-12-09",4.0,"(Bottle)  Pours black with a creamy brown head. The aroma is fantastic  boatloads of green, resinous pine, dank herbs, new cut grass, arm sweat, pot, tart apricot, sweet tangerine and peppery grapefruit. There is no question that this is a Black IPA and not a hoppy Stout/Porter, the hops are really brutal. Undertones of dry crustal malt, base malt, cookies, salt liquorice, dark fudge, light dark fruits, black coffee beans, bit burned, black pepper and new asphalt alongside a touch of alcohol. The flavor is light sweet, medium to heavily bitter and light acidic. Aggressive hops in the taste as well  grapefruit, pine, resin, grass and herbs. Fairly robust maltiness with a medium roasted profile alongside a base malt backdrop. The mouthfeel is round and soft at first but the hops and roast makes the finish quite tart. Light carbonation.

I detect some fruit in there, mostly dark dried fruit but they have a certain freshness to them. Like a mix of figs and apricot is probably the best way I can describe. Taste is initially very strong in dark (70%+) chocolate and coffee, with a very strong bitterness. This bitterness is what sticks, and it turns into a fresher and more piney type as the VERY long taste lingers on. The finish is long and rich and overall just excellent.

3975,"2011-11-29",2.9,"In the past I enjoyed many of Stones offerings. For me Stones has stumbled a bit Belgo Old Guardian a medicinal nightmare, Emperial IPA (14th Anni) a bit of a practical joke. In short I was in fear of Stones falling. Stones 15th was a step back towards a true path. This beer has set a little as I found it a bit rough in early September. This beer was served in a Imperial Pint glass.

Ar- A mixture of darkly roasted nearly cocoa malt and coffee. This mixes well with a pungent citrus and pine resinous notes. A bit boozey but not bad. In short the beer smells like arrogance. 

Ap- The body of the beer is black. The head of the beer is thick and looks like a fizzy chocolate milk. Nice head retention is noted. Crazy thick lacing marks the beers passage from my glass. 

T- The flavor of the beer is deep bitter pine combining with darkly roasted chocolatey malt. A powerfully abrasive alcohol weaves itself around the citrus and pine notes. Full on bitter finish. Not bad but doesnt rise to the level of greatness.

P- The body of the beer is pretty full and a bit oily. The alcohol is a bit hot and abrasive at times. I do like the mouth full of hops feeling on a plus side but cannot rate higher than 2 because of astringency.

O- A bit of a mixed bag. I dig the bitter mouth full of hops. I dont really dig the whole Black IPA. Not terribad but not really great. A whole hell of alot better than Emperial IPA.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AverageMan"

There was a hint of the roasted malts if I inhaled deeply.  The taste was very unique, as the bitterness of the hops and coffee flavor of the malts were both immediately and distinctly detectable.  There was some butterscotch and  molasses flavor in the profile as well.  The body was creamy and on the thicker side of medium.  The overall impression this beer left me was that of a very dark coffee with cream.

Pours a very dark brown, almost black with a great medium brown head. Tastes like a great DIPA should, with the surprising stout-like characteristics.

Light notes of tree bark, licorice, wet leaves mix in but this is definitely all about the hops.  This is bitter but perhaps not quite as sharp as expected.  The flavor adds some burnt ashy notes with a lot of pine hops, toasted caramel and bitter unsweetened chocolate.  Theres a lot of heft to this, right from the get go, so its not the easiest beer to consume.  Then again, Im not really into the Black IPAs.

Piney hop flavors are noticeable and set off by notes of coffee grinds.  Feels like there is a touch of chocolate malt in the back end.  The palate is appreciably slick and oily with a lively carbonation.  Finishes with a lingering bitter hop bite accented by a hint of ash.  Feels like they succeeded in building a bigger version of the Sublimely Self-Righteous/11 Anniversary, but I cant say that bigger is always better here.

Does Stone make a bad IPA? They definitely have a handle on the emerging style known as black IPAs. This one is no exception; hitting a good price point it is an excellent beer. At 10% it is hard to call it sessionable but it does not erode the palate like some other high ABV releases. Get some while it is fresh and enjoy a true gem.

Aroma / Appearance - Inky black in nature the body hides anything within well. A cascading head develops and soon builds into a soft layer the color of faded leather. The nose contains the smell of wet asphalt which has been recently laid down. Coupled with the bright hops it snaps at the senses. Malty undertones anchor it in reality.

Flavor / Palate - Coffee, fresh tea, and bark from a young pine sapling rub on the tongue. The strong finish is sharp enough to leave a distinctive taste in the back of the throat. The battle between hops and malts provide interest with a texture that feels like dark chocolate and resin. I cant wait to see what 11-11-11 brings.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3975,"2011-11-03",4.7,"THOUGHTS: Wow. Very nice. Almost the reverse of most beers in that the hops are all up front and then the malts kick in. Hid alcohol fairly well.

Simcoe had to be a big part of this one.
TECHNICAL: Bottle poured and opaque black in the glass with an average to large, light brown head that mostly diminished and left excellent lacing. The aroma had moderate roasted malt; lighter dark chocolate and coffee; heavy to nearly harsh pine hops; slightly lighter grapefruit hops; and alcohol. The initial flavor was light to moderately sweet and light to moderately bitter; while the finish was moderately sweet and moderate to heavily bitter. There were pine hops, grapefruit hops, roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, more hops, alcohol, chocolate syrup, and dark chocolate.

Maybe its the longing for those deep winter stouts.  What head was left was very dark almost reddish brown in color, I sipped it, and then off the table.  Mistake.  This beer is obviously very fresh, it had just appeared at the local market.  Nonetheless, color is jet black, carbonation is creamy.  Mouthfeel is light.

Taste has more charred flavor, sweetness in the form of imitation cherries, and fresh hops much like an IPA.  The hops sneak in from the back of the mouth and linger like a sonofabitch.  Aftertaste is some real exhaust, we have coffee grounds, burnt coal, dryness from the hops, and of course the palate piercing paradoxical dirty monkey out to ruin you good time.

The sensations in the mouth are incredible and change from moment to moment, and keep changing and shifting as the irresistible sips keep piling up minute to minute:  mild sweetness and richness gets upturned by a sourness, and then a piney hop bitterness starts a relentless campaign to invade and occupy every diverse dimension of the palate - - tongue, cheeks, even glottus - - various dimensions of the oral cavity all start clocking in like AP & UPI teletypes after some rare spectacle - - taste buds and oral nerves you never realized you had before flashing like Vegas neon, croaking like lit-up lily-pad frogs by nuclear plants, whole oral flavor networks swaying, and careening like decks of creaking plankwood on ancient war galleons.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, brown, mostly lasting.
Body is opaque black (flashlight tested).

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (roasted grain, dark chocolate), lightly to moderately hoppy (resin, grapefruit), lightly yeasty (dough), with a note of alcohol.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, moderately to heavily acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately to heavily acidic, moderately to heavily bitter, unclean.

Medium to full body, velvety/creamy texture, lively/soft carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic, lightly astringent.

Truly disappointing, mainly because it looked so good to begin with.  Nice dark lasting head and completely opaque too.  And the mouthfeel is pretty nice as well...a bit hot/boozy but not out of line given the ABV.  But thats pretty much where the good stuff ends.  The aroma is surprisingly simple and light for a 10+% stout, just roast and chocolate and green hops...theres no allure here, no depth, just some basic expected characters that lay there in the glass with no enthusiasm to entice you in any way.  Heck, theres not even any vanilla, which is usually a freebie with a beer like this.  The worst part, though, is the almost shocking sourness in the mouth...highly unpleasant.  If the mouth experience werent so off-putting, I could probably forgive the boredom of the nose and give this a low/mid-3 kinda score, but alas, something went wrong with this one.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

3975,"2011-10-06",3.8,"Black.  A surprising cascade of medium brown head, 2-inches thick and creamy.  This is surprising.  Normally for this style, brewers use a minimal amount of black malt and roasted barley to achieve the color thereby not obscuring the malt prominence; Stone apparently has other masterful designs in mind.  Aroma is sap, bark, pine, moss, and burnt marshmallow.  Body is medium-thick, slightly syrupy.  Flavor is a light syrupy sweetness up from with bitter Christmas tree resin following, Bark, Charred malt, hints of burnt nuts.  Very bitter, lingering.  Very good, still not quite the best BIPA Ive had or the best offering from Stone.","Providence, Rhode Island, USA","PapaSkeetSkeet"

Maybe a whiff of herbal hops here and there, but that seems generous and maybe a little bit of my imagination is expressing itself. Flavor is a pleasant mix of bitter coffee grounds, dark chocolate and prune like dark fruit with anise and lots of hops. Perfect balance on the palate after the first scalding sip.

Overall, I think this is pretty good, but I would take the 11th Anny first if given a choice.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
3975,"2011-09-25",3.8,"Bottle.  Pours black with a thick tan head.  Aroma of roasted malt, sweet citrus, rich sweet malt, hop resins.  Flavor is very imperial stout-eque (roasted malt, sweet rich caramel malt, nougat, vanilla) with some citrusy-ness from the hops.  Black IPA is a bit of a stretch here, Id certainly call it an imperial stout overall.  Definitely an interesting impy though!

3975,"2011-09-25",4.5,"Bottle. Aroma of coffee, boysenberry, raspberry mousse, orange, medium-dark chocolate, anise candy, plenty of other stuff Im too lazy to focus on because I just want to drink the beer. Flavor is enormously bitter leaving powerful bitter chocolate orange notes wafting toward the nose. Alcohol is certainly present, but for everything going on around it, pleasantly so. Sort of a burnt toffee sugars sensation left on the tongue after the swallow. Its a bruiser, but a complex bruiser, and I quite like.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
3975,"2011-09-25",3.2,"Pours, well, black. Opaque in appearance in my tulip, with a massive brown head that recedes quite slowly. Aroma presents a lot of chocolate notes in addition to grassy and moderately citrus hops. Immensely flavorful palate. Roast, chocolate, a bit of coffee, followed by an immense wallop of hop notes and bittering that lingers extensively. Despite the color, this is still an IPA, and it tilts way towards the hop site of the balance equation. Its unfortunately too bitter for the amount of malt body and sweetness for my tastebuds. Its a really well-crafted beer, but not one to my liking.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","RyanMM"

It has a medium body with a slick mouth feel.  Flavor is bitter sweet chocolate and coffee backed by a bold hop citrus taste like orange zest and ends with an even bitterness.  In the after taste the chocolate stands out a bit with a light bitterness hanging on and the alcohol showing just a little.  Overall its an interesting brew, but  Im not liking the mix of citrus and chocolate in this one.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RSRIZZO"

3975,"2011-09-24",3.8,"Fresh bomber. Pours nearly pitch black, with an opaque, dense looking body.  A thick head of smooth, medium-dark foam floats atop the surface, slowly fading away to a wispy center film with a pronounced edge.  Tall, brooding flares and jagged splotches of lacing coat much of the glass.  The nose is intensely hopped, showing orange and grapefruit skin oils most prominently, with secondary hints of fresh green grass and mild pine resin.  Beneath, an ample malt body shows bittersweet chocolate, dark chocolate fudge brownie, darkly toasted caramel, and some fruity coffee bean.  Toasted marshmallow lends a unique sugary element, as a subdued rummy  booziness is actually somewhat nice. Flavors are dark, bittersweet, and very chocolaty, simultaneously showing ample roast, choco-fruity sweetness, and biting citrus hops. Charred sugars and dark fruity elements work nicely with coffee bean roast.  Pithy and oily orange intensify on the finish.  The palate is medium-full, mildly slick up front, but quickly shifting to a drier, roastier, somewhat boozy finish.  Overall, its a unique take on the imperial black IPA. Its far more citrusy than the ""Cascadian"" versions from the Pacific NW.  Still, theres far too much sugar and booze going on for me to drink this in quantity, which is why I prefer the smaller 11th Anniversary/SSRA.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Theres also a lingering bitter hoppy finish.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit creamy and coating, and is well carbonated.

The flavor is sharp and hoppy, with lots of espresso bean and a leafy green quality too.  It is almost a bit much for the tongue to tackle.  Like most Stone brews, it is impossible to ignore it or take it lightly.  The label notes are justifiably proud.  Stone 15th is probably the best black IPA I have tried.

3975,"2011-09-23",4.5,"<br clear=""left"">Ive never been a fan of Black IPAs, not that I hate them - just that I dont love them as much as it seems I should. Then a friend told me I absolutely must try Stone 15th Anniversary Escondidian Black IPA because it would change my mind. It did.I poured a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass.Appearance: Completely opaque black body. Forms a large, creamy, dark brown head which retains and laces extremely well.Smell: Since this is a Stone beer its no surprise it smells like a San Diego imperial IPA: tons of light, bright flowers and citrus - plus some tropical fruit juice nectar. Theres a hint of alcohol in the nose, too - like a clean rum, although there is no real stout-like aromas which is odd considering the appearance.Taste: One of the reasons Ive never been a big fan of black IPAs is because they literally mess with your head: your eyes see stout, but you tongue tastes imperial IPA and the brain often ends up confused. With Stone 15th Anniversary Escondidian Black IPA this is indeed the case, but its the only instance I can recall where such confusion was so lovely.Up front the beer begins with intense bitterness, it follows with a juicy, sweet, almost refreshing taste of citrus acidity and juiciness. It finishes with a dry sensation and taste of lightly roasted malts and leaves a lingering aftertaste of coffee and dark chocolate. It wouldnt seem that these flavor components would go so well together - citrus and chocolate? But they do. The IPA component is very West Coast style with an orange juice-like taste, but the stout component is soft, smooth, and slightly sweet. Its the bitterness and accompanying dryness that accounts for the perfect transition and blend of the flavors. Maybe its a little drier than Id prefer, but the great taste of the palate more than makes up for it.Mouthfeel: Surprisingly light, and only medium-bodied with a silky smooth texture and no carbonation. The hops linger on the tongue, but are highly tolerable.Drinkability: Weighing in at 10.8% ABV, Stone 15th Anniversary Escondidian Black IPA would seem to be a beast of a beer, but its amazing at just how drinkable it is. While there is minor alcohol presence in the nose and a slight warmth in the throat, the genuine flavors of the palate are so flavorful and the mouthfeel so smooth its difficult to NOT suck this down as quickly as possible. This beer would work very well as either a dessert or with dinner itself because its complex palate makes it so versatile. Overall, Stone 15th Anniversary Escondidian Black IPA is definitely the best black IPA Ive ever had. I wish Stone would make this a regular offering.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Piney, rubbery hop aroma and charred, dark chocolate malt.  Absolutely opaque black with just the slightest corona of ruby tint at the thinnest edge of the glass under bright halogen light, all topped with a brown head that starts off thick and strong and recedes to a small ring.   The flavor matches the aroma with an upper cut of strong, peppery, earthy hops hitting first followed by a right hook of dark chocolate, cocoa, charred wood, molasses and brown sugar.  Leaves a pungent, vegetal taste on the tongue with whiffs of that chocolate and wood in the aftertaste.   15 years after they started brewing great beer in San Diego, Stone continues to kick it up a notch with a great anniversary ale, and makes no apologies for it.  Happy Anniversary Stone!   **********New note***********   Wow, I cant believe its been 3 years already!   The hops have definitely faded and theres a more pronounced molasses and prune flavor now.  Still loads of chocolate but the vegetal component has increased (probably the hops getting old).

Bitter coffee on the finish.  Medium carbonation.  Full bodied.  This beer was much closer to a heavily hopped imperial stout than an IPA with a bit of roastiness, which is how I usually like my black IPAs.

The pour is a little deeper actually than Sublimely Self Righteous (SSR) with more of a menacing, deep mocha head generating. Suddy, big bubbled retention. Spotty lace. Nose is quite fresher in the aromatic hop department with tropical melons, grapefruit pith, cinnamon, durian, squash, and even something like zucchini bread (nuts, cinnamon, pumpkin spice, zucchini/squash). Taste is all over the place- hard to figure out what the hell is going on here. Some salt water, some earthy bitterness, lots of nut skins and shells. Palate at first is silky and rich but then goes very neutral and clean. Feels like stout in the body, which is nice over something weak and thin. But not a lot of roast, chocolate, or richness comes forth. Nothing that I can perceive as the ""backbone"" to this stout that was then hopped to death. It was better than the not fresh SSR I had alongside, but there is something wrong here. Maybe too powerful for its own good? Not focused very well and Stone keeps using more and more of these weird squashy hops in the nose that remind me of...gasp....Stone 14th. Please no.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

3975,"2011-09-02",3.8,"Bomber dated August 2011. Drank 9/2/11. 

AROMA: Hops (primarily grassy hops, some pine and citrus notes), roasted malt, coffee, earthy character. Light creamy sweetness from the malt. Faint vegetation. 

TASTE: Similar to aroma. Earthy character behind the coffee notes more pronounced than on nose. Malt sweetness also more pronounced on palate than aroma, albeit behind the big bitterness from the hops and roast. 

MOUTH FEEL: Quite carbonated. A bit sweet. Slight alcohol warmth. Hop oils seem to linger on back of palate. The sweetness mixing with the hop (and roast) bitterness and the resulting awkwardness on the palate is why I believe I generally prefer IPAs over DIPAs - regardless of black or pale or in between. 

OVERALL: The faint earthy character, especially on palate, in the background reminds me of Rogues Chatoe Rogue Dirtoir Black Lager - except on steroids and heavily hopped. 

Body like Great Divide Anniversary Wood Aged Double IPA meets Stone Russian Imperial Stout; then add a plethora of hop oil and subtract the wood notes. Thankfully not as sweet at Averys Maharaja.  

Despite the faint off-note on the nose, a great and complex brew.

The taste has a lot of sweetness followed up by a good bitter bite. It starts out with fudgy chocolate cake mixed with pineapple-citric hop oil. Some roast and smoke chimes in, filling out the malt flavor, and it ends with mild smoke and hop bitterness. The bitterness is strong but fairly smooth. However, theres some more booze pushing through, as well. Its an undercooked chocolate rum cake with tangerine pith icing. Very fun to drink.  Its creamy and smooth even as it smolders with pleasant bitterness and unpleasant booze.

Really reminds me of batch 1 Darkness although this is clearly more bitter. Excellent hop profile and and an even more  impressive malt complexity. Lots of delicious depth. Easily the best black iipa Ive had (sorta redeeming the style for me as of late), and a true one, great dark malt flavor but huge hop flavor and ibus. A huge surprising home run from Stone.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

3975,"2011-08-30",4.2,"Pours near-black with the deepest brown head Ive ever seen a beer, and quite foamy as well. Nose is enormously potent, dominated by bitter hops and supercharged sour fruit, with a touch of coffee and dare I say bubblegum. Flavor is all business; the front is tame but the backside is strong and multi-layered. Very bitter (who didnt see that coming) and has a burned (but not bad) quality. Finish is intense and lingering with a more tenacious bitterness than any other IPA Ive had before. Im more into a more standard IPA/DIPA but this is an experience worth having.","Washington DC, USA","caralkaline87"

3975,"2011-08-30",4.4,"22 oz. bottle from SoHo Organic Market in Elizabeth City, NC.  Pours black, not dark brown, but a thick-as-motor oil black with a rich khaki head.  The aroma is almost equal parts smoky, roasted malt and piney hops with neither overwhelming the nose.  Smoky malts are the dominant flavor with burnt espresso, smoke, and bitter chocolate leading the way and are balanced by enough hops that you realize this is indeed a black IPA.  The mouthfeel is almost creamy from the smokiness in the malt.  This is dangerously drinkable at this ABV but there is moderate alcohol warming.  A top notch black IPA.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","zizzybalubba"
3975,"2011-08-30",3.3,"From the bottle. It pours very dark brown with a tall but slowly shrinking tan/orange head. The aroma is kind of weird at first with some strong pine, peach, cotton candy, cooked vegetables and cocoa. Not real good, but the dense hoppiness saves it from being downright bad. The flavor is a bit better, but very sticky sweet up front and painfully bitter/alcoholic on the back end. Flavors of peach and pine to start and then straight to a punishing bitterness with hints of dirty roasted malt. The palate is creamy, but I find this one hard to drink. Not really complex or well integrated, just another assault on the senses.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

3975,"2011-08-29",4.3,"22oz bottled Aug 16, 2011.  Served at around 50F.

Pours black with a large thick brown head that leaves a nice pattern of sticky lacing and holds one of the best caps Ive seen.  She sho is purty!

Aroma is pine, spruce, grapefruit rind and citrus, dank, along with some of that delicious cat spray, also some coffee, roasted malts and chocolate, but the hops really take center stage in the aroma.  Excellent strength.

Flavor is intense to say the least.  A ton of pine, juicy citrus and resinous, dank hops up front intertwined with strong chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, anise and molasses as well as a bit of caramel and dark fruits, nice bitterness and some alcohol on the finish.

Mouthfeel is medium plus bodied, sticky, good carbonation.

And I thought Sublimely Self Righteous was the most intense Black IPA out there...  Not anymore!  A new king has been crowned!  Holy hell is this some good stuff.  Ridiculously hoppy and the great roasted malt component holds its own.  Gonna be enjoying this some more for sure while its around.","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"
3975,"2011-08-29",4.1,"Pours the darkest of browns with a medium brown head.  Not beautiful, but a nice cascading effect in the head makes the pour worth watching.  Nose is hops with notes of wood and spices, along with an alcohol undercurrent.  Flavors are similar, but really pack a punch, as the hops take centerstage, initially, fading into a roasty, hoppy, dark spicy afterglow.  The hops character is very similar to Stones Arrogant Bastard, but the complementary flavors are different...smoother, richer, a bit sweeter.  Flavors linger on the palate forever...youll have taken your next sip well before the previous is gone from the tongue.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"
3975,"2011-08-29",3.6,"Bomber. Pitch black colored beer with a big tan head that leaves attractive lace and has medium-to-good retention. The aroma is all piney and resinous hops mingling with soft roasted malt. And the funny part is that the roast is almost completely absent from the flavor. There is so much piney and resinous hop flavor and bitterness form start to finish that I think no one would be the wiser if this was a golden colored beer. Ok so now Im freaking out and think Im imagining that coffee in the aroma. But it really could be there in the flavor as well but is just very well integrated with all the hop bitterness. A little rough and brash, especially in the finish, but I kind of expect that from Stone. Not a smooth or balanced beer by any means. But its fresh and pretty low in alcohol character for a 10%+ beer, so I think I can finish a bottle without much of a struggle. I can see some interesting character developing with some time in the bottle. This has the dark malt and bitterness to age for some time, if the oxidized hop oils dont turn it to shit. Might be a fun experiment. 11th anni was great after half a year in the bottle to come together and still had good hop aroma. Im still not sure why they decided to do basically the same beer again, just turned up a bit (and I dont think this is as good either), but maybe theyve painted themselves into a corner in the last few years.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

The flavor is an interesting mix: certainly initial bitter fresh hops and chocolate along with roasted malts. Also, this beer has a distinct peppery, spicy flavor that seems like peppers and almost reminds me of that great Mexican dish Mole. Very interesting.

It just tastes like a generic, hot bitterness.  Its vaguely piney but more like spruce and fir trees.  Very odd, seems almost chemical.  Harsh and unpleasant.  Im hop head.  I love bitterness.

Pours a dark brown/black with a soapy tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves just a few light flecks of lacing.  The aroma is full of resiny, piny hops, with a spicy hint of alcohol coming through.  On drinking, the flavors introduce huge, rich coffee flavors that are backed by a dark fruit tanginess.  I love the contrast between the aroma which makes me think so much of fresh hops and the flavor that I get with each sip, which reminds me of cherries covered in dark, bitter chocolate.  The body seems a little over-medium, with an oily feel that coats my gums and leads to a very long, satisfying coffee aftertaste.

3975,"2011-08-25",4.4,"Bottle and served in my GI IPA Tulip: Jeez this pours black with a lovely creamy tan head that left excellent lacework upon the glassware. (It looks just like a beautiful Imperial Stout). Once you got to the nose it shows more a DIPA character than just a hopped up Impy Stout. A ton of citric, leafy, resiny, and spicy hops over a layer of black, chocolate and biscuity malts. A hint of tobacco and tar but for the most part this is mostly clean of any appearance of sweeter caramel or toasty malts. Smells every bit of an Imperial IPA that just happens to have very dark malts. The initial taste was a wowzer! Smack me up side the head and call me Nancy! Big brash catty resinous leafy peppery and herbal hop bitterness and moderate citric fruitiness confronts the palate and shows who is boss... mommy. Oh there is some noticeable alcohol presence that helps cleanse the palate and added bonus of getting ur freak on. In midstream you find the malts attempting a brief and somewhat successful counter attack against the bittering hops before those pesky green nuggets of wonder force the end game and decry ""I AM AN DBIPA, RESPECT MY AUTHORITY!"" and finally put the malts out of commission. The mouth feel is lively, sprite, and aggressive with just a bit of chewy chalkiness and boozy bite.  The Stone Sublimely Self Righteous Ale was very good and Mountain Standard DBIPA even better but the top dog for the genre is Beer Here Dark Hops. While the brew ROCKS, I will still put it at #2 in the Blackened IPA category only cause the Dark Hops is a bit more drinkable.

The flavor starts with a quick dose of citrus.  Through the middle there is a good dose of chocolate which mixes with some light roastiness and lots of pine in the finish.

3975,"2011-08-20",3.4,"A: The beer pours almost black in color with two fingers of tan head that has great retention and lacing.

S: Smells like a classic hoppy Stone beer. Tons of grapefruit peel and pine with some intense herbal and woody hop notes. There is a fair amount of roast to it. A hint of fruit on the finish.

T: The roast flavor is a bit more powerful than I expected. There is a touch of chocolate followed by lots of grapefruit and a little bit of pineapple. Herbal and piney hops on the back end with a lot of bitterness.

M: The body is quite full with a medium carbonation with a lingering bitterness.

O: Not as good as Stone 11 or SoCal Hop Salute, but not bad. A bit boozy as it warms in the glass.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3975,"2011-08-20",3.9,"Wow, this one is all kinds of CrAzY!!!  Motor oil pour with a dense chestnut foam that leaves suds clinging to the inside of the glass.  Visually, would easily mistake this for a world-class stout.  Nose is aggressive pine, cocoa, freshly brewed coffee and molasses.  The citrus notes, if present, is overpowered by roast.  Flavor is a bit eye-crossing at first but your palate adjusts.  Again, lots of dark malt, brown sugar, chocolate, Ponderosa, and just a hint of grapefruit.  Thick and chewy.  Definitely not bright enough to be even thought of as an IPA...but it was an experience!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
3975,"2011-08-19",4.0,"Jet black with a thick strong brown head that retains well and leaves excellent sticky lace. Sure looks like an imperial stout. Lots of everything on the nose - resinous pine, chocolate, coffee, citrus. Same thing on the palate - a shot of hops bitterness followed by a long smooth chocolate and espresso sweetness. Full bodied, minimal carbonation, silky creamy smooth, and a lingering dark chocolate sweetness. Tastes and smells like they mixed a batch of Ruination with their RIS. Just a bit overwhelming.","Pacific Palisades, California, USA","RedSox2004"
3975,"2011-08-19",1.9,"Escondidian?  Yeah, thats something to be proud of.  For those of you that dont know, Escondido is one of the most ghetto North County Suburbs in San Diego.  Actually, it is THE most ghetto North County Suburb.  So, as you will see, this is quite fitting for a name for this beer.  Furthermore, Imperial Black IPA?  Yeah, just what the world needs and practically the most predictable thing that stone could have done.  Pours the dark brown color most Black IPAs do and sports a tan head that starts rather thick but settles fairly thin.  The nose smells like old coffee, rotting vegetable matter, and driveway black top.  The flavors, if you can call them that, are down right putrid.  Well start with the bitterness...its retardedly faceless, brash, harsh, cloying, and not anything anyone with a sense of taste would find enjoyable.  The ""Flavors"", hidden behind this bitter, bitter nonsense, are just as off-putting...abrasive roasted malt that tastes more like burnt rubber than anything else, bitter licorice that tastes like its been run through a used 10-day old coffee grinds Randall, and a finish reminiscent of spoiled lettuce.  Then theres the boozy alcoholic nature that looms around the whole experience, making each sip more painful than the next not to mention that indescribable stone house character is ever so present in this beer.  So let me be frank.  This beer is absolutely awful.  Yes, Im known to often bash Stone, but I do give them praise when they deserve it, it just happens that that doesnt happen too often...but this beer here, this is seriously one of the worst beers stone has ever made...which is sad, because I have actually enjoyed a few of their newer beers the past few years and I was starting to let up on my hatred, but this beer is so god damned bad...fuck.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
3975,"2011-08-19",4.0,"Bomber from Marine Mart Miramar:  Pour is black with a huge dark mocha head. Aroma is chocolate with a hint of citrus and pine.

3975,"2011-08-19",3.0,"Bomber.  Wow this stuff is over the top.  Super fresh hops--tastes like swallowing frech cones.  The hops go horribly with the obver the top roasted-soyish malts.  The score on this one is a huge shocker.  This over-the-top trend is really getting old.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"
3975,"2011-08-19",3.6,"A solid pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a four finger thick, dark brown colored head.  The head is very dense and leaves lots of thick lacing as it slowly subsides with a very rocky surface with deep crevices in it.  The beer is an opaque, dark, black color.  The aroma smells of candied citrus fruit and berries that is backed by a rich, roasted, and burntly sweet-rich malt character; this last has notes of dark chocolate and something like coffee syrup (though not nearly so sticky sweet).  The roasted character leans more towards huge toasted grain notes, which is good as burnt notes would really clash with the hops.  The combination of roast malt and fruity hops combine to contribute a spiciness to the nose that reminds me of a christmass cake flavored with orange zest, cinnamon and allspice.

Sweet dark malt helps support a big candied citrus zest character, roasted lychee and super ripe tangelo zest.  This is backed by a huge herbaceous pine character that transforms into a huge, aggressive bitterness that is a combination of hops as well as the burnt / roast malt; the bitterness, really, really lingers on in the palate, when you take another sip the bitterness is there up front only slightly tempered by the rich malt character.  This has a fair amount of body to it, though the bitterness in the finish is easily able to clean up the palate from the somewhat viscous, mediumish body; actually the body of this beer is actually fairly light considering the strength of this beer.  The roast character in this beer is actually a lot more aggressive than in a typical Black IPA; it contributes lots of burnt, black malt notes, some burnt grain husk character, a big toasted whole grain character (though this is more significant in the aroma), and a supporting, not really noticeable in and of itself, dark malt sweetness.

I cant believe I am saying this, but the bitterness is so huge that it is distracting me from the other flavors in this beer; one could look at this as a good thing given that this beer would likely be a clashing, jarring fight between the vibrant American hop character and the burnt / roast malt notes, but really hiding this clash doesnt make this beer better, especially since these Black IPAs always end up being a clash between these two components to some degree no matter what.  If you are in the mood for an aggressive, cacophonous ride of a beer, then this beer certainly fits the bill; I am actually even enjoying it a bit more than I would have guessed in the end, especially given how harsh the flavor is.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
3975,"2011-08-18",4.0,"Imperial indeed. This is one confusing beast of a beer. Pours thick, and pitch black, with a burnt mocha head -- super dark. Put it under your nose and close your eyes, and youd think you were sniffing a deep transparent orange syrupy thick IIPA -- something along the lines of a PtY -- except somethings different. Someone threw a chocolate bar in. With the huge amount of malts it must have taken to produce such a viscous, dark brew, this is essentially an uber-hopped imperial stout. The aroma is actually quite sticky. The flavor, clean thanks to the 10.5%, is actually like someone dumped a Ruination into an RIS. Its a monster of a brew thats entirely bipolar -- one second you think youre drinking a IIPA, the next you think its so syrupy its got to be a stout. Really, really interesting brew -- itll keep throwing you off, and its like nothing Ive ever had before. Kudos to Greg and the gang... this is anything but ordinary.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

Very agressive, would you expect anything less? Bitterness shines. Happy 15th","Buffalo, New York, USA","swoopjones"
3975,"2011-08-18",3.8,"On tap (at multiple places). Pours with a deep black body and a large, lasting brown head. Aromas are a bit husky, roasty, citrus, tropical fruits. Somewhat dank hop character. Flavors are roasty, chocolate, fudge and malty. Some citrus and fruity hop notes. Roast flavors dominate a bit too much over the hops for my liking. Medium to medium-high carbonation. Dry. No fusel, but it is quite warming.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

Grapefruit, bitter dank hops, sweet chocolate as it warms, lots of roast, very bitter-sweet stoutish.  A nice big beer, but not quite as big as the NHC black IIPA.  I need to try a bottle and update my rating.

On cask.  Heavy black pour, small tan head, almost disappears.  Lots of sweet milk chocolate, slight roasted malt, grapefruit, bitter hops, and quite a bit of astringent alcohol coming through.  Got a lot more milk chocolate and alcohol on this try.  Creamy cask mouthfeel, on the heavy side like an imperial stout.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"

Initially strong hop nose, lots of pine and citrus, a touch of pineapple before some dry roasted nutty chocolate. Agrressive hop palate, bitter grapefruit and spice jumps in right at the start running through the finish and lingering long into the aftertaste. Toffee predominant in the malt, ovaltine like chocolate and some nutty dryness. Malts are quite pleasant but hops definitely kick their ass in this one. Love it.","California, USA","BeerLimey"
3975,"2011-08-16",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 22, 2011 Served from a 22 oz bottle from OTM. The appearance is a beautiful black hue with the body of a porter with a huge foamy brown head that grows long after you stop pouring. Love the appearance. The aromas have a heavy hop resin that is being suffocated by roasted malts, caramelized sugars, loads of molten chocolate, and some pineapple as well. The flavors enter more like their Smoked Porter. Great deeper roast malt profile. Some chocolate, caramel, hop esters, lots and lots of hop esters build on the tongue for a bit and then the chocolate takes over. More flavors include creamy orange, black pepper notes especially in the after taste, and a healthy does of alcohol at times that is usually hidden, and a heavy pine taste that reminds me of dark version of Anchor Our Special Ale.The mouth is full bodied with a great creaminess to it. Besides being a touch too drying at times and overly alcohol at times I Love this beer! Happy Anniversary Stone.

Resampled with a 2nd bottle and this one was a little more over the top with hoppy pine resins. The malts are completely obliterated and thats a shame.  Some black licorice. Still very good but didnt blow me away as much as the first bottle.","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"

3975,"2011-08-15",3.9,"As a resident of Escondido with the blessed proximity to Stone, I had to get this on release day!  Bomber purchased today at Holiday Wine Cellar ($5.99).  Pours into Stone IRS snifter a very black hue with three full fingers of very creamy mocha head.  Aroma veers toward the hoppy side with notes of bright citrus, dank hops (cat piss), and some sappy pine.  But there are some lighter roasty notes on the nose as well with a bit of chocolate and licorice/anise.  The taste starts with the sharp hop intensity (more citrus and dank) that you would expect from Stone.  But the taste does very soon after move into considerably dark roasted tones with notes of high cacao dark chocolate (far from sweet) and black coffee.  Finishes with a lingering smooth roastiness, and with a touch of alcohol heat and lingering hoppy bitterness.  Though under the same style, this leans noticeably more towards stout/porter territory than the Sublimely Self Righteous which is firmly in the hoppy camp.  I dont get the 100 IBUs that are supposed to be in this brew.  The ABV is also higher (vs. the 8.7% SSR) which I actually.  This is a really fine brew, but I still think I would go with the SSR if I had to choose.  (3, 590)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"

Appearance:  Pours a very dark brown with a cap of tan cream that retains throughout the session. Leaves behind spotty lace.

Aroma:  Grape fruit,  roast, celery, alcohol.  More of 10th hop nose than 11th.

Taste:  Huge bitter danky hops, alcohol, dark roast coffee. Becomes more ipa-ish as it warms.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied moderately carbed.

Overall: Another good Black IPA from Stone. Tastes a little bit different than SSSRA. With SSSR, you see the dark malt, but dont taste it so much, but with this beer, you do get a layer of chocolatey roast. I would definitely take the recommendation to drink this fresh.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"
