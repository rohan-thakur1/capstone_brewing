2895,"2015-08-05",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 8, 2016 October 2014 Magnum drunk 7/25/15.The mark of a fine saison lies in its perfect appearance. Thats not true at all, but Dupont, Blaugies, Thiriez and Fantome all have wonderful heads with near-perfect retention. That is true for Mr. Hills Belgian offerings and this one is no different. Bright golden appearance with just a touch of haziness and white head atop.Absolute crazy aroma. High acidity with light plaster, cedar and some grassiness. Very similar phenol profile to Dupont; nice and peppery, dry. Reserved but ample funkiness combined with American hop notes (light juicy fruits and stone fruits, plentiful floral notes, minor citrus). No alcohol and no flaws.The flavor is acidic, very brightly so and carried on by a tight carbonation and malty yet not sweet texture. Lots of honey-like notes from the malt and a good dose of pepper and tart acids to keep things very dry. Vibrant and lush and all this with 9 months of age on it.  I could see this being a bit too brash/powerful very fresh and probably very interesting and potentially incredible after a couple more years. Much like Id imagine an American-hopped Dupont to be. Wonderfully drinkable with lime-like brett, honey, meyer lemon and black pepper all lingering nicely on the finish. Flavor dosent quite live up to the aroma for me, however.  Theres just a bit too much tropical fruit like acidity and sourdough-like breadiness.  Maybe a touch of alcohol in the flavor, as well (very similar to the light alcohol I get from Duponts saison).  9/5/7/4/16Cascade dry-hopped version 2016 drunk 5/30 and 6/3/16.Was pretty let down by this one all around.

This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a hazy yellow color with a soft foamy white head that dissipated within less than a minute. Lacing is somewhat stringy.
The smell starts off with a nice sweet citrus to rustic funk. White grapes, lemon, lemongrass enliven to bring about an extra little spice - what seems like peppercorn.
The taste takes the sweet to combine nicely with the rustic and the funk through the previously mentioned flavors. Spice (peppercorn) comes back to balance and add an extra little kick to it. As it warms, it gets a slight sour to tart edge to it and its absolutely fantastic. Theres no aftertaste and it has a quick little sweet to rustic to slightly sour finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a super nice sessionability about it. Carbonated nicely as a saison, Id say this had a nice semi-spicy to sour to tart feel over my tongue.

Pours a hazy sun-yellow color, with a big, froth head.

Has aromas of wet grass, hay, citrus green apple peel and a lovely, slightly fruity, acidity. Bretts blend well into the rustic characteristics of the nose, providing an enjoyable freshness. The nose reminds me more of a Berliner Weisse, than a classic Saison, while being a bit richer and more pronounced on the nose.

Has a lively, very refreshing carbonation. While the beer is still relatively low in alcohol, its got a decent body to it.

Begins with soft wheat, wet hay and acidic lime, inviting sour bretts to the palate. Has a truly refreshing beginning, almost mirroring the nose, balanced by bready, slightly biscuity malts. Taste is still without a doubt providing a very pleasant freshness, with the right amount of lactic citrus fruit among funky yeast and wheat. Ends with biscuity malts among citrus bonbons, revealing a good amount of sourness.

A real treat, my first Hill Farmstead brew, a fuller bodied Berliner Weisse - or a truly refreshing, sessionable saison.

2895,"2014-06-30",3.8,"Bottle with major thanks to Bacterial. Pours gold with steadily streaming bubbles replenishing a dense white head. Lovely lacing. Aroma: lemon drop, hay. This feels soft and gentle. Nose hints at mineral and pepper, but neither is really a major feature. Grass, hay, bread, and the feeling that this is going to be sour. Taste: lemon drop again, sweet citrus up front that gives way to mineral, somewhat tart finish. Not tremendously dry. The creamy mouthfeel and softness of carbonation reminds me of sherbet or lemon sorbet. Overall: this is a lovely beer. Its hard to say how much knowing its HF and knowing its the first time Ive had a normal sized pour of their beers affects things -- I definitely went into this with a mindset to give it extra close consideration, and the expectation I would be amazed. That probably isnt fair. I like this, its a nice saison, and perhaps that should be enough.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

Pungent funk and lemon drive the aroma, I like Chriss ""lemon drop"" descriptor; given the aroma I expect this to be tart but not particularly dry. It is indeed gently tart and not particularly dry. Lemon. Bread. A saison in the Fantome / Jolly Pumpkin vein (appropriately; these are tonights pairings) rather than Dupont let alone the usual American saison esters. The funk recalls a mild camembert. Just a hint of grassy hops closing out the flavor very late. Very softly carbonated, almost creamy, very full body.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

The bottle from box aroma on this one is pretty solid... lemony, sort of lightly funky with lots of hay, grass, and dusty malt offered. Some leafy hops work well in the mix as well. As it warms it opens up and there is some distinct barnyard earthiness.

2895,"2013-10-01",4.6,"4-13 Batch, reviewed live 8/14/13. Bottle had a slow gush upon opening, poured into a HF wine glass. 

A- Pours a hazy orange -yellow color with a soapy white head that fills the top three inches of my glass. As it slowly fades to about a third of an inch, it leaves insane lacing on all sides of the glass. Carbonation is noticeable, and appears fairly high, though alright for style. 

S- Brett straight up. It rears its head with lemon, orange peel, pepper, and some complimentary band aid phenolics. 

T- Awesome tartness that you wouldnt have expected from the smell. Tons of lemon mixed with a little bit of grassy flavors, as well as some spicy notes to balance the whole thing out. Pretty much the perfect saison as far as flavors goes, but that is just one mans opinion. Decent bitterness at the end as well, it plays well with the pepper notes on the back end. 

M- Prickly carbonation, medium to low body with a crisp finish that sports some decent drying, although nothing that isnt tolerable, or enjoyable for this style. 

O- God- the last time I had this same batch it didnt blow me away. This time around, it is clear that the bugs have taken over and just bumped this beer up in to the top tier. The lemon adds a tartness that is very well balanced by the pepper phenols and bitter hop notes at the end of the taste. The high carbonation and drying effects make you crave another sip, and the appearance is as close to perfect for a saison as one could ask. Give me more please....","","justforrazors"

It pours a hazy dull yellow with a one finger white head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a thicker ring. The flavor starts with a quick dose of citrus. The finish has moderate floral notes, light lemon/lime peel, and some faint grassy bitterness. Its light-medium bodied with mild carbonation.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

2895,"2013-07-13",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2013 750ml bottle. Highly effervescent, pop of the cork, slowly over-flowing the lip. Tall, thick, lasting white head atop a cloudy gold body. Lots of band aid / glue in the nose.  Brie / goat cheese / curds, somewhat buttery but that blows off after a short time. Hints of sweetness in the approach are washed away by high acid and effervescent carbonation, leaving a waxy and oily coating in a dry and bitter finish. Theres some tropical phenols that linger, and some higher alcohols, but I find myself overly sensitive to and what I get is pretty mild. I would probably guess that the alcohol has creeped over 7% in this bottle, its very dry, theres some very light fusel blowoff. Tropical, gummi but not sweet, phenolic, waxy, estery, musty. Very brett-y character. Its certainly lively, and I can appreciate the effort, though I am not so keen on this mustiness these days.  So now I wonder how much oak is in this?  I have read that releases of Arthur will approach Art, meaning a portion is barrel aged a.l.a solera process (???), and that would explain the brett inoculation as well as the neutral oak / vanillin / dill / coconut smell.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Pour is a hazed golden orange with a frothy white head that fades to a thick ring and decent lacing. 

Aroma is more floral and bready than expected with a Belgian yeast body; mild citrus, orange peel and peppery spice. 

Flavor is a little overly spicy and honey/yeasty sweet. Has a strong grassy and peppery typical farmhouse base but the tart fruit and stronger hops hurts the drinkability and subtlety.

Soft and lighter bodied with mild carbonation.

2895,"2012-03-31",4.2,"750ml bottle, consumed on the same day as Anna. The pour yields a lightly hazy, beautiful golden body that shines brightly in the light and shows consistently streaming micro-bubbles. A short but steadfast blanket of creamy, snow-white foam sits at the head, giving tissue-thin, tattered sheets of lace to the glass.  The nose is masterfully simple, based in über-fresh malted grain with dry, peppery, floral yeast and crisp notes of grassy hops. Like in Anna, there is a suggestion of wet hay or straw that lends a bit of farmhouse character, but missing is her subtle honey kiss and wildflower complexity. This one is more classic saison.  Flavors follow the nose, crisp and snappy, biting grass bitterness showing atop a base of fresh cereal, hay, and dried bread. White pepper and other dry spice show in the yeast profile. The palate is dry as a bone, laced with lively carbonation that quickly clears away what little residuals the fully-attenuated, moderate body leaves behind. Damn fine beer. Not quite the showstopper that Anna is, but an excellent example of a straight-up, classic saison. Close your eyes and youre instantly transported back in time to the fields of Wallonia.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
2895,"2012-03-25",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2013 Bottle from BeerPilgrim11.  Aside from a small taste of Anna at the Hunahpu release (thanks to whoever that was) this is my first Hill Farmstead brew.  This pours is a standard gold color with a thick white head that fades to a thin layer.  Its quite grassy and herbal in the aroma.  Smells a little like doing spring yard work with flowers, herbs, and freshly mowed grass.  Definitely can pick up the use of Euro hops in the scent.  The flavor follows in line with that.  Theres lots of crisp grass, straw, and bready notes leading the way with spring flowers mixing in.  This kind of tastes like a Pilsner colliding with a Saison.  Its clean and refreshing, and just a solid brew to kick back to on a warm day, which is exactly what I did.  Great beer!","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"
2895,"2012-03-17",4.8,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2012 PIcked this up two weeks ago at the Hill. Thanks Shaun! Beautiful beer! Put in the fridge for a few minutes and poured into a Hill Farmstead glass.

A - 3-finger crystal clear head that shimmers like crystal. Very tight bubbles almost creamy. The beer is a hazy golden color. Deep orange gold color. Gorgeous beer.

S - Great spices like pepper and some other very bitey spice. Loving the very bready and sort of butter-like croissant scent. Theres a terrific tangy scent that you related to great farmhouse saisons and a lot of dry white-wine appeal. Id be happy just smelling this beer! 

T - Dry Saison is what I first get. The spice is a bit too much but its not terrible, Im just not a fan of so much spice. Maybe thats why they call this a ""rustic"" saison. Very dry finish which pulls the spice away leaving a lingering tangy taste.

M - Huge explosion of bubbles on the swish but not bubbles that expand your cheeks. Carbonation without full-ness. Very nice. Light bodied and easy to drink

O - Id like this beer. HFSs Anna I prefer but this is still a solid Saison but just a little spicy for me.

Revising this to a 4.8. I reviewed this earlier in the year. The latest batches are more tart / sour. The spice is almost gone, still a little buttery on the nose. These beers are starting to sour and Im sure its intentional. Going to save my other 3 of these for a year and hope they develop into something else.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

2895,"2011-08-14",4.3,"Clean rusty yellow appearance; sweet, soft herbal aroma shows banana, cinnamon, white pepper and stone fruits in its first subdued pulse; underneath, sauv blanc like aromas of minerals and tart white fruits; and finally, a richness of herbs and pungent garlic cloves licked with sugar.  It nails that complicated-calm thing that the style exemplifies.
It feels and tastes a bit more undetailed at first.  Tarragon, banana, lemon zest, seeds.  It seems sweet and lacks the kick I want.  But as it coats the mouth, theres layers of citrus and stone fruits that begin to provide layers of detailed acidity and tangy sweetness, and this is cut with the bitter dryness of cardamom and sesame seeds.
The palate is spritzy and sharp at first, but settles down, smooth and pillowy with an awesome acidic edge that feels only of fruits and never of vinegar.  It finishes with a dusty, floral flavor mingled with a dry pear skin flavor, and lingers long.  Its a great take on the style that that hasnt even begun to show the potential of its details yet, at which point it could be something truly extraordinary.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

I could go a long time on a plain saison like this. Pale slightly hazy pour, with a ton of white head. Aroma is right within the style of the classic Belgian farmhouse ales.

2895,"2011-05-30",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2012 On tap at Hill Farmsteads first anniversary celebration. Although I was really in the mood for bretty deliciousness, this brew offered an welcome change from the tart palate wreckers I found myself spending so much time with on Saturday. Typical saison pour- hazy peach with a massive white head. The aroma held an awesome balance of fruity dough, citrus fruit, and cereal grains. The flavor was much the same, with a perfect melding of flavor profiles. The palate, like every other beer of the day, was truly phenomenal. Perfect supple carbonation and dry finish.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
2895,"2011-05-30",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 25, 2016 My Bottom Line:
This Saisons seamless intertwining of ingredients is softly and eloquently expressed from aroma to finish in the cushiest of airy bodies. Orange-y zest, cereals, farmhouse yeast and spicy hops unite and become a single complex entity. Wow.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A thick, creamy head of foam decorates the misty translucent golden.
-The fluffy mouthfeel is absolutely divine; perfectly quenching while delivering all the flavors this brew can present.
-The fruity character can easily come from spices, hops and/or esters. The flavor profile is so tight, individual ingredients are hard to dissociate. Bravo! 
-The aroma is simply tantalizing.
-This has to be bottled. I know Art is bottled, but this source brew deserves its place in the spotlight too. If anything, it might even be more drinkable. And such a bottling might take care of the disparate ratings its been getting...

2895,"2010-12-09",4.6,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2012 In short: A very rustic Saison with a generous amount of fruity grassy hops.  Great session beer.
How: Many 750ml bottles
The look: Partly cloudy blonde body topped by a large white head with good rentention and leaving good lacings
In long: Nose is very rustic (almost wild) just how I like it from a Saison, a side of banana cake and bright shinning grassy and fruity hops.  Mouthfeel is just Wow!  Very lively very clean.  Taste is uber-crisp crackery malts, plenty of rustic yeast and a generous amount of fruity hops and yellowed grass.  Fruity notes of citrus, tropical fruits and a bit of bananas.
