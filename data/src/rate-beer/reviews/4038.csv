4038,"2016-10-09",5.0,"So many flavor-hopped beers go flavor-flat after the first few sips that its usually prudent to order half pints. But the flavors (aromas in the context of tastes) in this beer just keep coming and coming. According to the Oxford Companion to Beer, theres no scientific consensus that the aroma unit (AU) proposed by Nickerson and Van Engel measures what its supposed to measure. (See the ""dictionary"" entry on ""The Aroma Unit (AU)""). But assuming it did, this beers aroma units would easily top 100.","Mountain View, California, USA","dpitinga"

4038,"2015-04-21",4.3,"The beer is light and hazy, yellow with a little orange to it. Thick, creamy, white head. Good retention, some lacing. The aroma is juicy with hops and just generally excellent. Bright tangerines, pineapples, grapes, mango, papaya, raspberry, lime, peach. Just a bit of pale malt character in the background. Fresh fruit with a crackly bitter edge. Taste is moderately bitter. Solid hop flavor, more of the same fruitiness. Crisp and light on the palate with a certain creaminess. I dont know if its a mineral addition or something else, but this beer has that almost grainy, creamy heft to the body that really brings out the hop flavor. Normal carbonation. Really tasty stuff. Excellent example of why I keep going back to Cellarmaker.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

4038,"2015-01-03",4.0,"On draft at Caps & Taps. It pours a cloudy yellow color with a white head. The aroma is potent with fresh citrus, tropical fruit, lime rind and white crackers. The flavor has a little hop spice, citrus, lemon/lime, mandarin orange and apricots. Very light crackery malt. The finish is citrusy, floral and dank.

4038,"2014-12-30",3.6,"On tap @ Cellarmaker. Hazed orange pour with a white. Slightly buttery up front with a strong grapefruit and orange coming through behind that. A lot of pine, some sweet honey, and peaches. Kinda zesty and floral. Flavor is a bit on the sweet and peachy side. A lot of grass and some herbal notes. A bunch of orange, grapefruit zest, and green melons. Gooseberry on the finish. Pretty nice once you get past the butter.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
