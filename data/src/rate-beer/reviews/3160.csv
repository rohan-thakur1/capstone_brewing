The underlying beer is really complex, with a pretty puckering sourness thats also balanced by a long time aging in the barrel.

The berries add a straightforward ""fruity"" flavor and a great reddish tint, and the apricot accentuates the crispness and the dryness of the base beer.

The pour is a dirty rusty color with a small gray head that falls down with no lace. The aroma is more raspberry up front with a nice apricot and a strong funkiness. There is a little lemon present as well. The flavor is similar. There is a nice funky tart berry and peach combo that offers a little vinousness. The mouth feel is a little heavy for what Id like to see in a sour, and its relatively well carbonated. The aftertaste is all fruit and funk on the back end.

3160,"2014-12-06",4.7,"750ml bottle. Served in a Teku.

Aroma -- invitingly aromatic in a multitude of ways; mystical coalescence of fresh berries emanating off of the head of this unique brew. I could not ask for much more out of this brews aroma. A herd of curious fruit flies were swarming around my glass in a matter of minutes, and my place is nearly immaculate.

Appearance -- opaque, orangish-brown appearance w/ frothy, pearl-like head, which does not dissipate in Teku. A+

Taste -- Mouthfeel is absolutely stunning: unique blend of of sour, tart berries on the forefront w/ pronounced oak barrel on the finish. Lacto possesses an unparalleled consistency, which translates into this sour, crisp, transfixing tartness. One of the most outstanding mouthfeels I have encountered from Cascade Brewing over the years. 

Palate -- profusion of apricot and raspberries engulf the palate from the start and distinct oak on the after-tone. As mentioned above, the lacto is pronounced and blends especially well w/ the aforementioned essentials. 

Overall -- Words cannot describe the brilliance of this NW Sour Ale. Although this may improve w/ age, I am glad I am drinking this now. Truly tough to have any complaints about a single attribute of this world class brew. This NW Sour is on a scale of magnificence I have not encountered before.

3160,"2014-07-27",3.2,"UPDATED: SEP 4, 2014 Bottle, 2013 project. The description on the bottle has changed in terms of the barrel aging (<14 months phase 1, 7 months phase 2). Anyway, pours dark amber with off-white head and little floaty bits of yeast/particulate. Threatened to gush, but aside from the floating yeast it all ended up in glass. Aroma: initially poopy, but once its in the glass its full on raspberry, oak, and vinegar. Cant smell apricots at all. Taste: remarkably dry, even with the raspberry jam-syrup in the middle. Bitingly tart finish. Jam and alcohol warmth. Drinks bigger than 9%. As it warms theres also a lot of acetone. Full body, lively carbonation, slick heavy and mouth-coating -- basically adheres to your mouth while it strips the enamel off your teeth. Overall: my wifes assessment: ""feels like I have a mouthful of unripe fruit - so tart but without a lot of flavor. Sorry, I cant finish this. I hope it didnt cost too much.""

The smell alone gets my saliva glands pumping. One sip - this stuff is sour as FUCK. Wow. Crazy sour. Raspberry skin, cherry juice, lemon flesh, stone fruit, apricots, peaches... just a cornucopia of bright fruits all backed with an insane sourness. Mildly acetic with hints of vinegar, must, yogurt, & wood. Despite the sourness, this still isnt the most acidic Cascade beer Ive had, which is nice (dont get me wrong, its still GERD-inducing, but its manageable).

A pink hued golden ale with a loose surface of grey-white foam. Smells of raspberries, bits of marzipan, and a little oak - really reminds me of Cantillon Rose de Gambrinus. Some hints of almond. Taste is crazy sour - ripping my enamel sour! Raspberries are in there, but fuck, this is SOUR. Some acetic quality, but tons of lemon, and hints of apricot in the back end. Thin beer with low carb and a dry finish, but the tartness makes me salivate Pavlovian style. Crazy beer.

3160,"2013-11-30",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
This highly acidic creation develops cherries and apricots in a nearly still mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam circles the cloudy amber.
-The very low carbonation seems to enhance the intensely sour finish.
-This bottle was only two years old and oxidation was already apparent in the nose. Not sure these Cascades age all that well (this is not the first time it happens to me with Cascade bottles).
-Cascade is the Cantillon of the Northwest. Always compelling, funky and sour, yet not always refined. 
-A touch of bready yeast appears in the flavor profile.

Absolutely delicious beer. Apricots dominate the fruit aspect of Noyaux, leaving the raspberries in the distance. Nice marriage of oak barrels, wine, and apricots. Sufficiently tart yet soft and light on the palate, even despite the nearly 9% abv.

3160,"2012-12-31",3.7,"A steady pour into my Bruery tulip produces a one-finger thick, pale, off-white colored head. The beer is a pale amber color that shows a clear, pale orange tinged, gold hue. The aroma has a bite of lactic sharpness to it, lots of vanilla, almond, floral apricot, touches of peach, lots of tart fruitiness, a touch of mustiness, perhaps a touch of something like cleanly fermented sour milk, and a sour raspberry note.

Quite tart, but, as with all of Cascades sour, quite cleanly lactic in its sourness, this accentuates a tart apricot flavor, a nutty, and vanilla like notes. Flavors of light raspberry up front lead to a touch firmer raspberry flavors in the finish that get accentuated by the tartness. A clean, supporting malt character provides soft flavors of pale wheat crackers, some touches of dried straw. As the beer warms up it gets rounder, a touch more full in texture, but still light enough to be quite quaffable (even dangerously so). Perhaps a hint of not really perceptible, but still there, soft sweetness helps to balance things out a touch, but really this is a nicely tart / sour beer. This beer has a nice fizziness to it, much is from the carbonation, but this is certainly accentuated by the lactic acidity.

As with all the Cascade Sours, this is perhaps a little too clean, but I still cant help but really enjoy this beer. The flavors that are here are really nice, clean, bright, with a nice interplay between fruit, nutty vanilla notes, lactic tartness and clean malt expression.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Its an orange coloured brew , cloudy, small head of foam that shrinks but doesnt go away totally. The little bit of foam still does leave some nice lacing behind and, oh, I see the beers entry has the name spelled wrong. Its Noyaux. Update to be sent.

The smell, well, its just heavenly. Big apricots, almost as big raspberries, the aroma you get from oak barrel aging...sourness supreme but I suspect, the taste wont be way over the top.

Apricot sourness, raspberry sourness, woody notes..man, this is one hell of an American Wild. Every new sip seems to kill the previous sip and this is one example(of many) of why certain brews *should* be bottled in the 750ml format. 8.94% abv? It doesnt drink that strong at all; this is dangerously drinkable.

Medium bodied, lightish to moderate carbonation(lightish on the front, moderate on the back end), the mouthfeel is just right for the style.
