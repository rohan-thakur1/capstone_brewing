3688,"2017-05-31",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed at a tasting at Jakes house on May 20. 22 oz bottle. Ive got so many of these at home, its a shock I havent rated one yet. The pour is a darker copper brown with a thick light tan pillowy head that falls off quickly, leaving only a couple spots of lace behind. There is a definite port wine to this one up front. Very dark fruity and dry with a light caramel and a hint of whiskey and a touch of oak. This is complex, deep, but the port is really trying to control it, and pretty much succeeding. The flavor is a little more balanced, though the port is heavy. The whiskey puts up more of a fight, letting a light vanilla, dark fruit, oak, and chocolate malt come through nicely. The mouth feel is a touch light with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly caramel malty and port dominated finish. This is damn good, but I can only wonder what would happen if the port had its edge removed.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3688,"2015-11-23",3.4,"22 oz. bottle, pours a cloudy murky orange with a small beige head. Aroma brings out lots of port liqueur barrels, some brown sugar and bready malt. Flavour is along the same lines, with notes of caramel, port, and bready malt. Fairly sweet and boozy. Medium complexity. Very good stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

3688,"2015-11-08",3.7,"On tap: The aroma consists moderate caramel, vanilla, oak, bourbon, light toffee, and apple. Its a transparent amber with a minimal film and a thin ring around the edges of the glass. The flavor starts with a quick dose of caramel and toffee. The finish has light-moderate vanilla, coconut, bourbon, light oak, and apple. Its medium bodied with mild carbonation. Overall, its sweet and a little too heavy in the barrel aging, but still pretty tasty.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

3688,"2015-05-01",4.3,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 2/18/2015. Pours hazy deep ruby red color with a 1-2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, vanilla, raisin, plum, fig, date, red wine, bourbon, oak, coconut, light leather, light herbal, and oak/toasted earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, vanilla, butterscotch, raisin, plum, fig, date, red wine, bourbon, oak, coconut, light leather, light herbal, and oak/toasted earthiness. Light tannic tartness and oak/bourbon spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, vanilla, butterscotch, raisin, plum. fig, date, red wine, bourbon, coconut, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruit yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome malt/yeast/barrel balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged old ale style! All around awesome robustness, complexity, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
