2918,"2016-06-04",3.9,"Really nice dessert cider. Deep focused sweetness, very juicy, rich. Maybe a hint of cinnamon but mostly a nice pure concentrated apple goodness. Maybe it doesnt have the intensity and depth of an ice cider, but its good enough as it is, esp for dessert, and a great price point.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

2918,"2015-07-07",4.0,"Bottle, shared on the bus at RBSG. I guess this is akin to a late harvest vintage in the wine world? Not as sweet or heavy or potent as an ice cider, but sharing some of the typical character traits of sweet vanilla cookie, baked apple, hints of spice. A bit buttery (in a good way), with a tartness in the finish that lends to drinkability. Very nice and complex for a sweet cider, without the cloying corn syrup sweetness that usually kills sweet ciders for me. Excellent.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

2918,"2015-06-13",3.8,"2 oz sample from bottle (375 ml). 

Appearance: Clear pale yellow golden with not much legs. 

Aroma: The description is quite accurate, theres some nice melon features along apricots, honey and mild spiciness but surprisingly not much apples. 

Taste: Not very sweet with again some nice melon features, apricots, honeyed notes, mild acidic presence and a bit of apples.

Palate: Medium body. Borderline syrupy, but not nearly as thick as ice cider even though it has a similar profile. Rather dull finish. 

Overall: Interesting product. It tasted light a light version of an ice cider. The melon presence is original and really enjoyable. Tasty and fresh.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

2918,"2015-01-11",3.7,"Purchased from Learys, the Amesbury location, Saturday afternoon. $9.99 for the gorgeously slender 375 mL bottle. To long-stemmed white wine glass, it pours a rich burnt orange. Honey orange, some may say. Viscid; my first thought was accurate. Served lightly chilled. Aromas of cherry blossom honey, holiday blend cider, agave syrup, DAnjou pear purée, flora grapes, and unripe plantains. Tastes the same with the addition of dried apricots, apple juice, and hay. Breathtakingly fruity. A lot going on in this ice cider. Viscous upon consumption; sweet notes spring forth under a hidden march of shining booze warmth. Seriously likeable.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
2918,"2014-12-10",3.7,"Bottle. Pours a very dark gold -- whisky colored -- with tiny bubbles clustering on the sides of the glass. Nose is apples, apple skin, almonds, cane syrup, and a touch of lime. Very sweet and malic on the tongue, but with a bitter thread running through it that cuts the glycerine sweetness nicely; its a seed and skin bitterness thats harmonious rather than clashing. Mouthfeel is very rich but not overly so. Finish is warm, turning a touch acidic. Really enjoyable.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"

Pours still with a nice golden color. 

The aroma is sweet, with a bunch of concentrated apple character, some honey, and a bit of floral perfume.

The flavor is very apple forward, again with the very concentrated & sweet apple character. Although it does have some nice tartness and light acidity, There is also a sort of mead like honey character to it as well. 

Delicious and rich, just like an Ice Cider ought to be.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
2918,"2014-08-23",3.7,"Bottle, pours a clear golden orange with no head. Nose brings out apple butterscotch, not much else. Flavour is very smooth, with loads of apple butterscotch upfront, with caramelized sugar in back, and a touch of molasses. It sort of burns a bit, despite only being 6.9% -- just like a typical ice cider. A lovely surprise. Not exceedingly complex, but still very nice.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2918,"2014-07-12",3.9,"Bottle @ Presidential Suite. Thanks, Kevin. Clear caramel colored pour. Sweet baked apple pie, caramel sauce, and brown sugar. Mild pear and honey.

2918,"2012-03-05",3.8,"Bottle courtesy of Paul at a small tasting with Max, Paul, and Andy.  Pours a clear gold and treacle color. Lots of apples, sugar and sweet apple, a faint bit of skins and tannins.  Sugary sweet apple.  Quite nice for such a low ABV.

2918,"2012-03-04",4.2,"Bottle shared by Paul, only $8/375ml. 7% alcohol is exceptionally low, but the flavor profile doesnt show that. Though it is a bit thinner than traditional ice cider, the sweetness and acidity are still there. Bright, spritzy, sweet nose, very easily drinking, I like the low alcohol on this, it actually works very wellan ice cider that can actually be drank at a normal rate.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
