1873,"2017-06-08",3.7,"First off, A+ on the name. On tap at the brewery. Pours a clear gold with a medium sized white head. Soft musk, a hint of fruit and light floral notes. Medium bodied, light musk, a bit of fruit, sweetness and grain, with the faintest touch of lemon zest. Slow and fruity into the finish, soft malt and grainy sweetness.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
1873,"2016-06-19",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
This authentic Heller Bock is all about its chewy malt bread flavors, leading to orangey accents and smiles of nourishment.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the misty golden shine.
-Alcohol is not present at all, which I appreciate.
-Herbal hop bitterness is moderate. The finish is a beautiful malty horizon.
-This is a superb example of quality malts and their expertly deployment.
-This pint is a trip to Germany, nothing less.

1873,"2015-12-04",2.8,"Older bottle bought online. American Maibock with medium thick, moussy, egg-white, relatively dense and stable head over a peach blonde beer, hazy from the start. Notably Belgian and in no way German aroma of crabapple, unsugared yoghurt, milk gone sour, ripe gooseberry, Durondeau pear, ureum and quite disturbingly so at first but quieting after a while, overripe kiwi, cooked grains, passion fruit, soaked white bread, natural rubber, Chardonnay, sourdough. Fruity onset, not unlike Belgian yeast and in that sense way too estery for the style, with hints of green banana, strong gooseberry and traces of passion fruit along with a green olive-like umami taste, softish carbo, supple and smooth body with lightly bready malt character with caramelly edge, honey-like sweetish accent, gliding easily down the throat, finishing a tad yeasty but primarily honeyish and lightly caramelly malt sweet with a touch of yeast, some retronasal rubber again and a very faint, purely structural presence of very weak, grassy hops not providing enough background bitterness to keep it in balance with the malt sweetness though a light earthy bitterishness does stick to the tongue; ends a bit chalky as well, a feature I strongly dislike usually. Ive had more than one traditional German spring Bock and this is nothing like it: too sweet, too estery (top fermentation!) and lacking in balance. It almost seems these guys are mixing up German traditions with Belgian blondes.  Jacks Abby just doesnt do it for me, I guess, but this bottle may just as well have been too old - honestly speaking, I expected a touch of American hops adding to the basics of this style, and they clearly arent there. Disappointing.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

1873,"2015-09-12",3.8,"Draught at Shaker Mill Tavern, 9/5/15.Clear deep burnished golden body is topped by a moderate amount of white head that slowly fades to cover.Toasted malt in the nose is tangy and sourdough-like but stops short of overdoing it, allowing light honey, freshly baked baguette and a good dose of herbal and spicy hop notes to come through. Clean and well-malted as all good German bocks should be, and showing appropriate hop rates with German varieties, as Jacks Abby is good about doing. No alcohol noted.Similar flavors abound: tons of biscuits and baguette flavors with a strong toasted malt overtone, which works with the spicy hops to balance the malt. Clean with zippy carbonation helping to lighten things and cleanse the palate on the finish. Very drinkable, very-well executed.

1873,"2015-04-10",4.0,"This was poured into a pilsener.
The appearance was a nice looking hazy yellow color with a super light carbonation seen rising to fill a quickly dieing white foamy head. Adequate foamy lacing graces the sides of the glass in a messy sort of way.
The smell had a rich sweet malts, somewhat like sticky bready candy and a light crisp spicy edge to it.
The taste was mainly the sweet malts through a sweet crisp biscuit-like edge. Theres a nice light sweet sticky aftertaste leading to a sweet wet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionable quality about it. Theres a nice soft creamy texture rolling over my tongue.
Overall, this was a wonderful take on a Maibock Lager. I would definitely do this again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

1873,"2013-08-20",4.1,"In short: A clean and somewhat hoppy golden lager boosting freshness qualities. Simplicity done perfectly.
How: Bottle 500ml, consumed super-fresh the day I received it, a few days after purchase, bottle from Loineshawn but it tasted as good as if the bottle was from someone nice.
The look: Clear blonde body topped by a medium white head.
In long: Nose has that true classic lager smell pushing forward bready cereals freshness surrounded by a hefty amount of leafy hops. I can never properly word that nice lager smell other than to say it is free of fruity esters and it is just plain pure basic freshness. Mouthfeel is spot-on, full body with plenty of soft bubbles, comfortable pillowy texture. In mouth the beer is even more expressive. A superb malt extraction that is bready, chewy, cookie dough and with an overall very fresh character. A solid leafy hopping that adds a dryness and a certain spiciness without a lot of bitterness. A superb execution of simplicity, great beer, underrated. .And what about that name, Maibock Hurts Like Helles, repeat after me, Maibock Hurts Like Helles, at this point Id be happy if Jacks Abby stopped making beer and they would just work for other companies full time naming things.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Thanks to all the great beer purveyors who keep interesting, quality product in stock all the time. Thanks to my wife who repeatedly puts up with my desire to seek out new and obscure brewers and brewpubs. I would have never gotten to 3k without her support. And now... on to the rating! I love Jacks Abby, I love almost everything they are doing. When a friend dropped some Jacks Abby, I decided that this would be my 3,000th rate. 50cl bottle pours a totally clear gold with some lacing, slightly creamy white head. Nose has a lot of fruit, plenty of pear, some cooked corn, some apple cider, a little bit of hay, some candy sugar, a little papaya. Flavor is sweet, more tropical fruit, candy sugar, a little citrus kicks in, some very light grapefruit, some candied kumquat, slightly metallic, plenty of malt, a nice grassy-ness, hay. Medium bodied, sweet finish. Very true to style. Not my favorite Jacks Abby, but another great example of the style they were aiming for.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
1873,"2013-05-18",3.2,"500ml bottle, thanks to Mike L. Bottled April 2013. Shared with the local group. Clear golden color. Thin white head. Some little splotchy lace. Medium body. Smooth, lighter carbonation. Kind of soft, more dry finish. Some bready taste, light pepper. Light sweet. Solid maibock.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
1873,"2013-05-16",3.4,"16.9 oz bottle to snifter (thanks DrSilverworm). Looks solid; a transparent gold with white lacing and lively carbonation. Smells and tastes solid; sweet, malty, and a bit hoppy with notes of caramel. Solid on the palate. Good beer.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
1873,"2013-05-11",3.3,"Pours a clear orange with a thick off white lacing. Somewhat fruity with notes of bread and cereal. Sweet, but not overly so.","Westfield, Massachusetts, USA","dogfish120love"
1873,"2013-04-28",3.4,"Bottle.   Dark rustic breads.  Touch of dark fruit.  Toast.  Nuts.  Seems like Im doing a giant jacks Abby tasting every night.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
1873,"2013-04-27",3.4,"From the tap.  Pours light gold with a thin creamy head.  Light toasty malt aroma.  Tastes like sweet bready malts mixed with mild herbal flavors. Good body, light alcohol taste and spot-on carbonation. Nice.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","szinck1"
1873,"2013-04-25",3.4,"500 mL bottle purchased from Learys for $3.80. To undersized snifter, it pours a clear Citrine/golden yellow; light orange when held up to the eye. It sustains a trim whitish head barely a fingernail in length. Smells and tastes of breadcrumbs/sourdough, white grapes, sawdust, tin, rolled oats, and lager yeast. Crisp, refreshing, just not all that complex. Would have again.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
1873,"2013-04-19",3.4,"clear dark golden pour with a filmy white head.  Aroma is bready, with light honey, cereals, subtle grass.  Flavor is sweet, but not cloying, and grainy.  Light nuttiness comes out as it warms, with sweet bread, and more grassiness tickles the tongue on the finish.  Moderately drying with a bit of sweetness on the end.  A decent beer, and a pretty tasty Helles Bock.","Chester, Vermont, USA","Jblauvs"
1873,"2013-02-20",3.9,"Bottle in NYC. Pours clear, muted gold with a small, white cream head. Pale, doughy malts on the nose. Medium sweet flavor with further doughy, bredy malts, light grains and hay, faint herbal notes. Medium bodied with fine to average carbonation. Sweet but not cloying finish with rich bread, hints of alcohol, mild cereal, touhes of bitter straw. Nicely balanced heller bock - which is an accomplishment.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
1873,"2012-07-30",3.8,"Immensely enjoyable and drinkable.  Not malty-sweet like many american heller bocks.  This has nice hop underlining and a beautiful hazy unfiltered yellow color.  This brewery is to watch.","Madrid, SPAIN","CamdenD"
1873,"2012-07-04",3.5,"Sweet malt, grassy hops, and citrus in the aroma.  Flavor starts with biscuit and citrus, with a little hop bitterness and alcohol in the finish.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","annunz123"
1873,"2012-06-27",3.3,"Bottle. Another good lager from Jack and his bros. The hops are very subtle under the more noticable malt sweetness and while not as tasty to me as most of the other JA offerings it is a very drinkable brew overall.",", Massachusetts, USA","BroSpud"
1873,"2012-06-05",3.7,"Bottle. Thanks Ernesto. Pours orange with perfect white head. Aroma of biscuits and citrus. Taste is spot on maibock","bloomfield, Michigan, USA","mikem409"
1873,"2012-06-02",3.7,"Another winner from the Abby.  Medium sweet with crackers and biscuits and a floral fruity hop bite that is similar to berries or grapes.  A little flat carbonation wise with a syrupy feel but other then that top notch.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
1873,"2012-06-01",3.7,"Sweet malty but hopped very well. This is awesome. I wish all lagers tasted like this.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
1873,"2012-05-18",4.0,"A deep piss yellow brew. Good carbonation. Light biscuit aromas and flavors. Very nice hop balance. A very drinkable and tasty lager! Medium body and satisfying. Good job with this one.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","MaBeer1972"
1873,"2012-05-11",3.7,"Bottle. Pours a hazy golden orange color with a small airy head. Nose is honey sweet with a big sticky biscuit and pancake note. Palate is thick and sticky with a nice coated tongue. Flavors of honey and sticky sweet grains light grassy hop notes and light fruitiness.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","SuIIy"
1873,"2012-05-10",3.5,"500mL Bottle, purchased at Craft Beer Cellar - Belmont, MA. Slight mineral and pine barrens aroma. A fair amount carbonation pushes out a slightly odd and mishappen malt flavors, its got a bit of earth, spice, and moss to it. The body is alright, edging sweet and alcoholic. Somehow, this just doesnt capute the malty richness that Im looking for in the style, and honestly, I was looking forward to a hoppy American take on this, as their other beers do. There are no real flaws, just the lack of punch that makes it notable.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1873,"2012-04-27",3.4,"Pours hazy gold into a Sam glass. Bright white head with good retention recedes to coat surface. Dusty sweet caramel aromas. Soft with bready caramel upfront turning slightly sour before the lasting bitter earth finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
