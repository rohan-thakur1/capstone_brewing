The sweet flavor has notes of yeast, banana, and wheat, and the finish is spicy. It has surprisingly much flavor considering its a Kristall - lovely!","Thisted, DENMARK","Maria"

Pours a golden colour with a lacy white head. Aroma of grains, hay and some weak papery notes. Flavour of grainy malts, wheat, citrus, pear and some weak banana notes. Medium bodied, soft carbonation and a wheaty, grainy finish. Finishes dry and grainy. Good drinkability.","Tampere, FINLAND","lusikka"
2625,"2012-08-03",3.8,"Pours an extremely pale gold, and has great head retention. Generous amounts of grain on the nose, with a subtle spice. Very lively on the palate and the fresh grain taste does not linger whatsoever. 
All in all I would dub this a delicious grain pop, that would be well suited for a hot sunny afternoon. Very drinkable.","Bavaria, GERMANY","Biergardener"
