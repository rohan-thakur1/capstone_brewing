In the light a nice ruby red color is unveiled. On top of the beer a nice soft creamy layer of brown foam is formed. It looks so soft. Delicious.
The smell is delicious. There is a lovely rich aroma of coffee, caramel, chocolate, liquorice and roasted barley. There are both bitter and sweet aromas, in very good balance. There is a lovely warming alcohol aroma. I also smell some vanilla. The smell is very rich. All aromas are clearly present and blend together really really well. It has everything a baltic porter should have: so gentle yet so rich and delicious. I love it.
The taste is also amazing. It is so well balanced. One of the best beers till now. I taste lovely aromas of coffee, chocolate, some red fruits and roasted barley. Sweets and bitters are in perfect balance. It is delicious. Estonian beers, especially from Põhjala, always amazed me, but this is next level. I might even call this the best beer Ive ever had.

1797,"2017-04-10",4.7,"Jai rarement vu un tel pétrole... Coulée bitumineuse, opacité totale et mousse carrément brune. Pas beige hein. Brune. Marron quoi. Nez enchanteur et pas agressif du tout sur le cacao, le café, le caramel bien brûlé, le miel, le sirop dérable, la mélasse, la noix, le pruneau, la vanille, la pâte de noisette, des notes de fruits confis (fraise, cassis, mûre...), et lalcool. On devine aussi les levures avec ces arômes de sous-bois et de cuir. En bouche, texture ronde au démarrage et grosse sécheresse avec une astringence très puissante par la suite. Cest même assez surprenant davoir un palet aussi desséché sur une seule gorgée ! Lalcool est au niveau, il pousse bien comme il faut, la carbonatation est assez faible, comme toutes les Porter de la Baltique ceci étant dit, mais que dire de cette amertume absolument monumentale... Les saveurs de malt sont douces, bien rondes, la levure est nette sur les premières secondes mais les tanins des houblons viennent frapper là où ça fait mal. Larrière-bouche est sur le cacao très amer et le marc de café. La longueur est interminable avec limpression davoir bu un ristretto intense sans sucre et qui colle au dent. On est beaucoup plus proche dun Stout que dun Porter. Mais que cela nous importe, le plaisir est là. On a la combinaison dun Imperial Stout au maltage extrême avec lamertume dune Black IPA. Sur la suite de la dégustation, le palet se mithridatise (il fallait le glisser celui là !) et on apprécie dautant plus les saveurs des nombreux malts utilisés dans cette recette. Au final, cest un savoureux breuvage qui nous fait passer par de nombreux états comme un bon plat nous propose plusieurs textures et flaveurs. Il me tarde de déguster les autres variations de la brasserie autour de cette Öö. Pas la bière la plus impressionnante du monde, mais une excellente pioche de chez Pöhjala dont le style global me rappelle, plus localement, celui de la brasserie La Débauche.

1797,"2017-04-05",4.2,"If any of these new generation craft breweries is to produce a top notch Baltic porter, it must be this one, situated in the heart of the Baltic region. Vintage bottle of about two years old, shared by Craftmember. Lightly lacing, creamy, pale beige, moussy head over a black beer with chestnut brown edges (showing its true colours only for about two millimeters off the edge). Lovely bouquet, a bit oxidized already but in the most flattering way imaginable, with impressions of very old dry madera, teriyaki, cappuccino in powder form, walnuts, bitter chocolate, tawny port wine, cassis, mocha ice cream, dried porcini, roasted saddle of hare, leather. Restrained candied sweetness (fig) in the onset with a dim background sourishness surrounded by much more outspoken, somewhat teriyaki-like umami flavours, softish carbo, thick oily mouthfeel, viscous; very nutty malt character, bitter chocolate in its core with lots of toasted bitterness all around, the bitterness accentuated in the end by spicy hop bitterness. Wodka-like warming alcohol pushes a beautiful old madera-like oxidation upwards through the nose and that is where the true nobility of this beer lies; never had it in younger condition, but in this somewhat aged form, it has turned into a very sophisticated example of its style, which - due to its (usually) lager nature, I suppose - remains still a bit underexposed in the modern craft beer revolution. Except for Poland, that is, and hopefully a lot more new breweries in the Baltic countries will follow the Polish example, or indeed this one.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

 Kolor:  Czarny. Nie ma prześwitów. 
 Piana: Na samym początku coś tam zaczęło się dziać. Po paru chwilach został tylko kołnierzyk nad piwem. 
Na koniec już nawet on utonął w czeluściach czerni.
Na krawędziach szkła nie można odnaleźć żadnych, nawet pojedynczych kropek. 
 Zapach:  Niby Baltic Porter, a pachnie jak 100%-owy. wysokiej klasy RIS.
Aromat jest głęboki i wielopoziomowy.
Początkowe nuty to: zdecydowana paloność, cukier trzcinowy oraz niekończąca się głębia czekolady deserowej. Pod spodem karmel, toffi, ciemne owoce.
Duża porcja słodkich pralinek, a z nimi orzechy oblane karmelem.
Pachnie na prawdę wybornie! 
 Zapach:  Nie wiem, może ja się nie znam, ale ogrom nut palonych przebija tutaj niejednego RIS-a.
Mamy intensywną gorzką i nadziewaną czekoladę, a tuż obok szwajcarskie pralinki z owocami w środku.
Jeśli mowa o owocach to z pewnością można wyłapać tutaj wiśnie i śliwki w czekoladzie. Posmaki kawy z odrobiną cukru trzcinowego i mleka.
Faktura jest wyborna, ubita jak białko na kogel-mogel.
Posmaki likieru owocowego goszczą na ustach i podniebieniu.
Długa, mocarna goryczka i jej nieodłączny wytrawny finisz przez wiele minut utrzymuje się na podniebieniu.

1797,"2016-12-16",4.7,"OK, this is my very 1000th beer. And my 58th Baltic Porter as per RB reckoning, although I do find that it is more, as many BPs have not been named as so, due to the somewhat negative perception of the style. BPs may not be my preferred beers, but certainly the most fascinating ones. The range of flavours, and the magic to transform dark lagers into masterpieces! I do love to think that I am the Southerner that has tasted and rated more Baltic Porters than any other, an undeniable regional style. New Zealand, guys  antipodean  I know it is not a competition, but I cannot get any close to numbers produced by the Scandinavian Mafia, the Baltic Triads or even the American Annihilators. And now I know someone else will point out that I am wrong. OK, back to Põhjala Öö, it was well chosen, I love the name. Yes, black as the night! Oily darkness, with a vibrant, dark russet head that has that lovely rainbow shine, making my eyes tear with expectation. Could be creamier, to be cold-blooded analysing, but I will still give it a five, for the pleasure it incites just by the look. Right, it is my 1000th, but I must confess that I have already done a lot of ratings that were unworthy of this position, so I will just post them later. This true Baltic Porter, by far the best Estonian one, is perhaps on the podium of world beers, with silver medal, and I found this bottle at Brolters, in Bremen. Thanks to Jinroh for pointing out the existence of this beauty. Right, perhaps I should mention some of the rating mates here, who have been really cool in exchanging stuff over these years, and of course I must give all praise to the missing Jono, I mean Jimthechap, who has been great company and an amazing friend. We are all concerned, and for his disappearance, but the hue & cry has already been raised. Search & rescue teams have trustworthy information that Jimthechap was last seen on an island to the north of New Zealand mainland, probably kidnapped by the publishing industry. We hope that he can survive this ordeal. And of course we have the great Traveller, ElDesmadre and Jinroh, all of whom I got to meet and share a pint or two. Tim, and Tsubasa, and Frank, and Ned, there have been so many others who have shared a drinking moment with me, or great correspondence, or who so kindly helped me with opportunities to taste some of the classic ones and so many novelties, and I just cannot have a fair and complete list of them here. Warm hugs to you all. I should also mention my landlord Spencer Kok, who is a pig and made my tasting session less pleasurable than it should have been. But back to this wonder of wonders, I absolutely love it. Aromas of tobacco leaves, smokey, vanilla, lakritz, leather, spiced schnapps, rum, and berries, perhaps the tart ones, and very dark ones, as somehow the aroma comes across to our eyes as being dark red. Lovely sweet taste of dark bitter chocolate, very dark and bitter, and a touch of roasted malts, bitter but sweet, with molasses, caramel, salt, liquorice, tart fruits and rum again, but never boozey, never pungent. This is all so incredibly well-crafted together, ultra-balanced. It is oily but round, silky even, absolutely easy to drink. A farking magnum opus. I am not sure of my other ratings for great beers, but I suspect this was the best non-Finnish true Baltic Porter. Or better: the best non-Sinebrychoff beer I have ever tasted. Gutted that I only had one bottle. Cannot wait to get back to Bremen for more.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"

Oh, hells yes, the Advent calendar is really moving in the right direction now! Day #15 is a Baltic Porter actually brewed on the shores of the Baltic, and it is fine. Its colour is what youd expect for a beer named Öö (night) but it tastes sweet and pleasantly boozy. Im reminded of the Turkish description of how coffee should be: black as hell, strong as death, sweet as love. Its not perfect - Id like to see better retention and lacing, the flavours arent completely integrated (though I suspect this would age beautifully), it finishes a bit sticky and mouth coating, and the alcohol carries a distinct sharp edge - but these are relatively minor considerations.

This chocolate truffle of a Baltic Porter expands onto toasty lengths and bitter roastiness before the deepest dark chocolate establishes a languorous kiss on the palate.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the pitch black.
-The chocolate malt presence is simply beautiful. Think 90% cocoa and real truffle material.
-Hop resins contribute to the finish as well.
-A smidgen of fruitiness is found.
-This is not a Baltic Porter in the heavy and sugary range. It is an ode to dark malts.
-Mouthfeel is smooth and rich.

Decent regeneration. Aroma is heavy on the roast with notes of rye bread and an undercurrent of booze wrapped in malt that has medicinal connotations. Oily texture, medium body, soft carbonation and a lingering, warming finish. Flavour is dominated by roast bitterness and boozy astringency. Letting it warm a bit only promotes the boozy, roasted malt qualities.

1797,"2015-08-08",3.9,"Thanks for picking up this beer! 330 ml. bottle. I have been quite curious about this modern boutique craft brewer (& apparently importer) from Estonia. A beer location that is completely unknown to me still. This one calls itself an Imperial Baltic Porter which is new to me. The ABV is slightly higher than the average Baltic Porter but not by that much, the taste is very big. It doesnt specify whether it is top or bottom fermented but it does come across as being top fermented to me. Pours very, very dark brown, close to black with a thick, hugely creamy coffee- head that does sadly collapse a bit too quickly. Overall still a gorgeous looking beer. Nose is heavy on roast, very roasted, close to burned coffee with a good amount of charcoal, there is some caffeine & mocha sweetness underneath, vaguely reminiscent of mocha ice-cream but the bitterness & heavy roast are the two dominating characteristics. The charcoal note is quite noticeable & dominant. Taste is heavy on bitterness, heavy roast, bitter roast, charcoal, burned coffee, charred malts, light berries, heavy roast, grainy, touch ashes, bitter liquorice, 95+ % cacao black chocolate, some light mocha ice-cream in the back but the roast & bitterness coming from the heavy roasted character reign supremely here. Body is a touch lighter than you would expect, rather grainy, a bit ashy. A bit too heavy on the roast for me  it does lend the beer a somewhat more unique quality  this one was still quite enjoyable. The roast did bring down the drinkability a bit for me. The bottle does state that this beer was intended as a slow sipper.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

Its quite simple though, maybe with some chocolate and coffee. It drinks smooth, sweet and velvety, you can feel that 10% only at the end in the aftertaste. Some hop bitterness also there, lingering with roast flavours for some time. Good beer, drinks easy, not too complex - but I guess I was expecting more complexity. Compared with the old version (as much as I can remember) the body feels lighter, is less pronounced and maybe less fruity. I have no notes from the old version though, so this is from my more than year-long taste memory.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
1797,"2014-12-28",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 4, 2016 1. Bottle from punka ( 3.30 - gotta love their prices!). Pours pitch black with retaining and lacing tan head. Lovely nanobubbles rise after the pour. Nose initially very chocolaty sweet, some candy sugar even, roasted malts, also bitter chocolate and spicy hops, dried dark fruits, slightly ashy... and a definite hint there that ride is gonna be a boozy one. Kind of like some chocolate cake infused in rum. Taste moderately sweet at first, then the not-so-subtle booziness kicks in together with hoppy bitterness, together forming a tour de force that not all beer lovers will enjoy. Its got some thick port-like warmth. Roasty finish quickly covered in vinous sticky thickness.

Should perhaps let my other bottles sit for a few weeks or months... wait for some full-on winter... I hope it gets better. Got to get it on tap as well. Will be back.

2. Tap at Põrgu, weeks later after review no 1. Black with tan head, retains and laces. Serving temperature is perfect. Nose is ashy roasted malts with hops and tartish red berries also present. Taste is roasty, deep dark sweetness, nice bitterness and chocolaty notes. Body is surprisingly light though still around plus medium; carbonation light, just enough to cut through the vinous thickness. Not really boozy but it does have a very nice warming effect. As it warms some more it gets somewhat disturbingly syrupy, plus the alcohol crawls forward. Overall very sweet yet surprisingly easy to drink - some days ago I downed 3 of these without even blinking, regretted it afterwards of course.

7-4-8-4-14 / 3.7

3. Another bottle from punka, nearly 2 months later. Ive had this ~10 times after review no 1, always trying to like it, but having mixed feelings... Pours black, tan head retains and laces. Nose... surprisingly faint... roasty, chocolaty, vinous, red berries, a bit of smoke maybe. Hint (and later on a loud alarm signal) of alcohol. Taste is very sweet, roasty and chocolaty, a lot of booze oozing through, quite a strong bitterness and roast in the finish. Syrupy sweet and thick mouthfeel, body quite heavy, carbonation thin with a certain prickliness. Red wine dryness on the palate. I do love big boozy Stouts but this ones a disappointment... 

6-4-6-3-13 / 3.2

Overall conclusions? Will not open my other bottles in near future, and will settle on tapped Öö for the time being - it truly did smell and taste a whole lot better at Põrgu. Will edit the overall score if one day I discover the 3.3 is not worthy enough.

P.S. - I had the old version only once and dont remember much of it so unfortunately I cant compare.

4. Yet another edit. Worth upping this from a mere 3.3 to 3.7.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Kauge"

1797,"2014-11-08",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 6, 2015 Tap (Pudel, Tallinn) (7+:4:7+:4:15=3.7++)
Well, I thought wed never see an Öö again (though I do still have one of the originals in bottle), Im glad to be wrong about that. Obsidian black, brief head. Very nice rich roast aroma, hint of dark chocolate cake or espresso. Full palate, but remarkably light, just gentle carbonation to cut through the sweetness. Retronasals packed with fruity esters. Youll notice I added this as an Imperial Stout, as modern Baltic Porters are lagers, so its misleading to enter this as one. (The previous 9.5% one brewed at Genika likewise.) Taste is remarkably non-extreme, which is a good thing. Its all about the roast, nicely burnt, but not ashy, just where I like it. Nice chocolate cakiness, sweetish but a million miles from sticky. If youre like Anna and take small sips, then you will get a waft of alcohol with your sip, but if you take a proper mouthful, theres none to be found. As I said, its remarkably light. And yes, that means that theyre not just hiding the alcohol behing sugars. Hops only have a chance to come out in the finish, a very nice barky dryness that lasts for a while. Of course the burntness is there too, that goes without saying. I have a nasty feeling I could begin sessioning this, but Im not sure how long I could keep it up! Very skillfully brewed impy.
Looking forward to samples of this at Porgu and Drink Baar, and some bottles from Koht...
Rerate: 330ml bottle (Koht Shop, Tallinn) (7+:5:7+:4:15=3.8++)
Beautiful. Reminds me of Koff Porter with its rich oily, almost tarry burnt roast, but slightly smoother and sweeter. Tiny hint of alcohol for Anna, but shes just weak and this beer is probably too dark for her. Quality control is now very good. Theres not much variation bottle-to-bottle or keg-to-keg. Which is a shame, as I now no longer have to pretend theres a noble motive behind me trying the beer in every bar in town!","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

Maybe not a good batch or it just too fresh (may taste better after couple of months), still brewery released it in this state so its fair to rate it, new rating is between these 2. Will have tasting of aged versions soon and update rating accordingly.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","martjoobolut"
