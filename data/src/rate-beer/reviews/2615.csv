2615,"2015-10-20",3.4,"Pours a hazy pale gold, with a light aroma of banana, bread, yeast, nothing surprising. The flavour is a step up, nicely spiced, hints of fruits, and a smooth-drinking feel with gentle carbonation. A decent weizen, worth a try.","Osaka, JAPAN","mrjez"

2615,"2015-03-19",2.5,"Pours dirty pale, hazy and not very nice colour actually. Foam is also not like weizens at all, I wonder if this can could have been an odd one. Aroma is wheaty, sweet bananas and a bit of cloves. Bit too sweet and bubblegummy for me. Taste feels carbonated, has some banana and fruitiness but in general is does not leave very fresh impression. Hmmm... When I had this beer maybe 2 years ago, I remember I actually liked it. This time, not really.","ESTONIA","jinroh"

Body as always with canned Japanese weizens is a little weak, but theres lemon, wheat, creaminess, light banana, little acidic. Decent and refreshing.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","EdKing"

Taste is less fruity than I expected, but then got a wallop of bananas on the finish. Pretty good for a conbini brew, mediocre for anything else.","Kumamoto, JAPAN","jdjuice"

2615,"2013-07-15",3.6,"On tap at the GJBF Osaka. Wow, this is actually a really flavorful weizen, with nice spicy notes to it. A cloudy gold pour. Clove dominates no real banana, I was impressed.
