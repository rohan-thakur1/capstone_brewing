862,"2016-12-12",3.6,"720 ml bottle. White label, same rice, 60% polish on this one. Not sure if it is exactly the same or not, since this was a Japanese bottle. Anyhow, ripe pears, rice, cream in the nose. Icy and shiny. Dry yet creamy flavor of rice, vanilla, stone fruit. Decent enough but not so special. Strange to see it at #2 in the top 50. I guess thats because it is exported in reasonably good condition.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
862,"2016-07-18",2.5,"This bottled Sake from a bottle shop poured a head of no head bubbles that was fully diminished and left behind a uncarbonated transparent clear colored body and no lacing. The mild aroma was of rice and some floral notes. The mildly vinous mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a lingering vinous aftertaste. The strong flavor contained notes of rice and vinous alcohol. A decent one but not one that I would consider drinking again. Too typical with the burning alcohol mouthfeel and taste. Typical burning alcohol mouth feel and taste.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
862,"2015-07-08",3.2,"Bottle. Pours clean and transparent with no visible haze or bubbles. Nose is all tropical fruit -- banana and papaya predominant. Clean and light sweetness on the tongue; mild apple and pear. Finish is crisp and very long. Its refreshing and well made, but theres just not that much distinctive about it. Competent.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"
862,"2014-02-01",3.7,"Pour at Yamaguchis. Probably my favorite sake of the night. Peach and wine and a very floral aroma. Nice.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
862,"2013-01-18",4.2,"Part of sake flight at Bamboo Sushi in Portland OR.  Smooth and aromatic sake.  Really great with fatty fish.","Maputo, MOZAMBIQUE","Imaena"
862,"2012-06-28",3.6,"It pours champagne coloured, with a slight greenish tint. The aroma has notes of: peanuts, passion fruit, alcohol, and rice-pudding. The taste is medium sweet that finishes dry and tart; there are notes of: Fuji apples, unpasteurized honey, rice-pudding, and a walnut finish. The palate is full bodied, slightly viscous, and a long finish. Overall, pricey, has a silly name - very delicious.","Ontario, CANADA","chris__hartley"
862,"2012-03-04",3.9,"I really liked his sake. Faint smooth and clean rice-like flavour and aroma. I enjoyed it a lot.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","dreamflower"
862,"2012-03-04",3.7,"Clear in appearance. Aroma is sweet, vanilla. Taste is also sweet and very smooth. Quality sake.","Steinbach, Manitoba, CANADA","northropfrye"
862,"2012-02-04",3.5,"Bottle. No head (still). Body is almost colorless (very faint yellow). Aroma is notes of banana skin, lime, honeydew, alcohol, pineapple, grain/rice, vitamin B. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, no carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic, lightly to moderately astringent. Very attractive fruity aroma, quite enticing.  Decent flavor balance but the only part thats a downer is the powerful alcohol burn...it cant really contain it and comes off a bit rough on the palate as a result.  Overall quite nice though.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
862,"2010-08-29",3.8,"Bottle: Pours a clear color with thin legs. The nose is huge, they packed a lot of florals and fruits into this one along with some musty koji and dry minerally rice notes. The impact is balanced; full bodied up front with a light sweetness and low acidity in the tail. Very nutty and floral, this is a bright and zesty sake. Very delicious with mounds of umami. Not quite so clean, but it adds to it, like a funky cheese. Complex.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
862,"2009-06-20",4.0,"Ah this one was my favorite out the sampling we did.  Strong mint aromas, like a spicy peppermint.  Pours clear, with nice lacing.  Clean upfront, light melon, herbal minty, with a slightly nutty finish.","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
862,"2009-04-26",3.4,"Damp wood & rubbing alcohol, touch of citrus and coconut oil in the nose.  Clear still appearance.  Hot, pungent and oily with heated alcohol, pepper, and melon. Im not finding it as sweet as others and Im finding the alcohol quite present.  Its not as clean or refined as I was hoping from reading the other reviews..I mean, its decent...but Ive had better.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
862,"2009-03-03",3.8,"Bottle. Pours slight yellowish tinge, like a very pale wine. Strong, long legs. Aroma is sweet, with a touch of fruit and alcohol. Light mustiness. Melon and dust. Taste is sweet and musty with sweet koji and a few fruity notes. A bit of dust (similar to the residual white dust on some hard candies).  No alcohol whatsoever. Long duration. Velvety mouthfeel. Good Ginjo.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
862,"2008-12-08",4.0,"Nutty nose with a touch of fruit.  Flavor is very sweet and rich, very flavorful and complex, with a nice finish.  One of the best sakes Ive tasted.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
862,"2008-05-16",4.2,"Crystal clear color.  Aroma of sweet rice, a little mold and new paper.  The rice flavor is sweet, rich and feels incredibly thick.  Honey sweetness and light floral finish.  Outstanding.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
862,"2007-10-27",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2009 At the Zipps wine tasting, Oct 25 07.  Quite sweet and very smooth, in addition to a mild flavor of spirits.  Some fruit. clear.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
