3709,"2017-06-15",3.5,"Copenhagen 15/6 2017. 50 cl bottle from Meny. Kinda crazy looking Santa with a Rabid Reindeer on the label. Pours hazy opaque dark amber with yellowish head. Settles as 1,5 cm thick layer of fluffy foam. Moderate lacing. Aroma is sweet caramel, alcohol and a tart fruitiness reminding me of unripe berries. A little moldy. Soft carbonation and oily palate. Flavor has strong sweetness followed by distinct sour bitterness. Aftertaste is spicy, boozy and with good bitter twang. Not the usual style for a Christmas Beer. But a good shot.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","DraftDodger"

3709,"2017-01-11",3.6,"Bottle 50 cl. Pours a cloudy, reddish brown with a creamy, yellowish head. Super spicy aroma from the Mosaic hops. Rich, malty body, again spicy in a spruce kinda way, massive crystal malts before a fairly hoppy finish. Interesting take on a Christmas beer. (An Irish Ale at 8% loaded with US hops? I think not. Lets call this an Imperial Red Ale, hence an American Strong Ale. 110117","","CloakedDagger"
