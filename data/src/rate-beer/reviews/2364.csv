2364,"2016-11-10",4.0,"Canned 10/21/16, drunk 11/5/16.Moderately hazy amber body though not intensely soupy or anything. Off-white, small head with moderate retention.Wonderful IPA-like Tree House treatment in the nose full of watermelon, lime and even some sprucy, spicy pine notes. Juicy, of course and clean with strong minerality and no alcohol or flaw.In the mouth its full of the strong watermelon juiciness. Light lemon-lime-like acidity easily balances things and the texture is very soft, with faint caramel-like sweetness and a bit of graininess/breadiness. Engaging carbonation, strong attenuation and no alcohol or flaw with a touch of lingering sticky caramel and long citrus and juice notes.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
