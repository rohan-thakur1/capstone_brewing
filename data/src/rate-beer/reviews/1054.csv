1054,"2017-02-19",4.0,"Bottle (750 ml), shared with family. Clear ultra-pale green-ish yellow with a medium white head, moderate retention. Aroma is super fruity (pears) with floral notes and some really fun farmhouse character. Taste is gently tart and fruity forward (pears) with some farmhouse notes, mineral notes and floral notes. Light body. Moderate carbonation, but still quite effervescent. Pear and gently tart finish, rather dry as well. This is incredibly easy drinking and quenching. Its not sweet by any mean, but theres enough fruit sugar to make it quite flavorful. This is a high quality quaffable Perry with some very nice rustic qualities.

1054,"2017-02-01",4.2,"Color amarillo pajizo, translúcido, con capa de espuma blanca que se crea y disipa casi al instante. Carbonatación media (burbujas finas sueltas y algún que otro burbujón de vez en cuando). Aroma a pera nueva, pera vieja, madera y un elemento que me recuerda a gasolina y que no soy capaz de ubicar (ese elemento es el que hace que el aroma sea verdaderamente único). Nada más dar un sorbo, aunque sea pequeño, es como si el líquido impregnara toda la boca con un toque ácido punzante que rápidamente se disipa y pasa a ser dulzor. Una vez tragada, si uno pasa la lengua por las paredes internas de la boca se encontrará con una acidez que parece como adherida a ellas. Increíblemente balanceada, extraña, arriesgada, compleja (sobre todo teniendo en cuenta esos míseros 4%).

And hot damn does the taste deliver- huge lactic sour balance atop clean and juicy brown and yellow pear flesh. Mild pear pie crust, cobbler and vanilla thickness gets annihilated by lightly tannic and hugely tart pineapple, peach, and passionfruit yogurt.

This pours with a fizzy, white-bubbled, half-finger thick head that pretty quickly disappears.  It is a clear, pale gold color.  The aroma has a nice bright pear note to it, a touch of candy like notes, maybe an earthy fruitiness and a touch of sour apple jolly-rancher character; there is also a mustiness that mixes in with the bright pear aromas.

This is sweet, but still quite light feeling.  A touch of carbonation adds a nice bite as well as a prickly texture.  This tastes quite fruity with obvious pear flavors, but there is also some notes of fruity green apple, a touch of kiwi and even something a bit like star fruit.  Some pear skin notes hit the back of the tongue towards the finish and adds just a touch of tannins.  This is nicely crisp and refreshing, though it is perhaps a touch simplistic.  Some rustic funkiness could have been nice, but this would likely have muted the great pear expression here.  I do like how eminently quaffable this Perry is.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Wonderfully tart and slightly acidic. There is plenty of pear flavor but essences of melon and green apple are to be found as well. The only place this Perry lacks is the finish. A tad too short.

Tastes wonderfully full of pear, but also has some honey, apple, and white grape juice in there too. Medium sweet and very fizzy. Soft and sparkly on the palate. Finishes a bit on the dry side and full of pear. Very drinkable, in fact, Im about to pour another glass.

Hard to compare this to a beer, so I wont. It is sweeter than champagne, and softer than an Asti Spumante.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"
1054,"2006-11-05",3.5,"Cork says 2003. Pours bright gold into a tumbler.  No head or carbonation. Spritzy and sweet with sharp, sticky pear.  Im afraid its a little too much like a pear wine cooler.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
1054,"2006-10-15",2.9,"This yellow cider poured with a thin bubbly head that dissipated right away. There is a fruity alcohol aroma and a carbonated mouthfeel. The taste is like pear juice blended with champagne - sweet with a slightly tart finish. Its worth drinking, but not exceptional.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
1054,"2005-12-07",3.1,"Sampled at Oakes 05 Xmas PartyPellucid yellow, no head. Nose is light with pear, some vanilla and brown sugar. The flavor is lightly tart and funky but thin and watery. Doesnt hold up to the apple variety but still quite tasty on its own.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1054,"2005-05-10",3.6,"golden pour with a white head. aroma is pear and ethanol, but not in an entirely bad way. this will wake you up. tart pear with a citrus lime finish. clean and good.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
1054,"2005-05-10",3.3,"This easily beat the Sydre Doux by the same maker, in my opinion.  There was a satisfying ""pop"" as I opened the cage and pulled out the cork on this 2003 bottling (handwritten dating on the bottle).  The pear is not overwhelming, although pear isnt an overwhelming flavor to begin with.  Hints of curry powder and light herbs mark the flavor.  A healthy level of effervescence and a tingle on the tongue give the sense of life to this.  Still, the profile is basically sweet and sticky, missing any tart or acidic edges.  Very nice drinking cider, if a bit on the wine cooler dimension.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
1054,"2005-03-11",3.2,"750 ml bottle, date unknown, shared with MartinT, Rastacouere, tiggmtl and ClarkVV.  Light amber color, champagne-like texture with some bubbles and touch of foam...simple, fresh fruit nose, sweet pears and touches of caramel/maple...sweet/tart balance in the flavor is very pleasant, simple, acidic & chalky towards the end...fairly wet finish.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1054,"2005-03-10",3.0,"Bottle at the Montreal tasting, 3/6/05.  Sparkling gold, dark, champagne-like color, with some honey tones in there.  Smells of sweet, candied pears, lots of honey and a touch of vanilla and cream.  Some spiciness throughout the body, and a little playfulness from the carbonation, but yet again, another cider that just seems way too sweet for me.  Powdery, dry lactic notes in the middle of the beer and then more borderline-syrupy sweetness on the end.  I keep thinking these French ciders, with fancy cidrerie names are going to be incredible but this one isnt any better than the decent perry I can get around here.  Dont judge a book by its cover, aint it the truth.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1054,"2005-03-09",3.0,"Boozey, sweet, dessert-like pear aroma with some mild spiciness.  Clear golden coloured body but no legs on the glass, no head, no lace.  Fairly sweet, seems almost unattenuated.  Lightly spicy - some odd, almost rubbery notes.  Still and watery texture with engaging carbonation.  Bottle sampled with ClarkVV, MartinT, muzzlehatch and Rastacouere.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
1054,"2005-03-07",3.4,"The Lure:Funky pears laid out onto a pie crust. Not too sweet and smells authentic, if not uninspiring.

The Festivities:Honey, hard pears and olive oil are pierced by the powerful bubbles. Rubber foams shyly, not necessarily welcomed. 

Transcendence:Just another orchard amongst many others.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
1054,"2005-03-07",3.2,"Light clear golden, thin white film, not much apparent effervescence despite the heavy tingling on the tongue. I was looking forward to that one, but Ive surprisingly little to say about it. Its fairly simple, well focused on pear skin sweetness, but fairly simple. Just refreshing through its considerable tartness, but at the same time sweet all the way where a little dryness would certainly have improved the balance.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1054,"2005-01-24",3.0,"Virtually no head. Body is medium yellow. Aroma is notes of apple, grass, flowers. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texure, lively carbonation. Clean and well balanced, but more resemblance to apple cider than pear, or so it seems.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1054,"2004-10-11",2.2,"A yellow very bubbly cider, that starts out with a huge white head, but it vanishes quite fast. The flavor is very strong and somewhat weird, since it has loads of carbondioxide in it, but also old pears and some wood. The flavor is sweet, slightly alcoholic with notes of overripe pears and wood, leading up to a dry but smooth end. Not really my thing.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
1054,"2004-09-04",3.1,"Nice golden color with no head. The taste is sweet and fruity with a nice sparkling pear sensation. Has a light sharpness.","Holbæk, DENMARK","jfm"
1054,"2004-05-19",3.0,"this thing pours a damn yellow color...thinish head...theres a smell like a fan over a freshly cut pear..the flavor is sparkling blanched pear and subtle champagne...its more sweet than dry though...and doesnt taste like much....These things dont belong on a beer site, theres no complexity going on here...but whatever.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
