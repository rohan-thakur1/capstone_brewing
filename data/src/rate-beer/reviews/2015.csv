2015,"2016-12-15",3.6,"Pours a dark, cola-brown, with little in the way of head. Aroma has some coffee, some chocolate, some nuts. Flavor has notes of coffee, chocolate, nuts, roasted grain, some leather. Not a bad beer--nice to see these guys can do more than a hazy IPA.","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"
2015,"2016-12-08",3.7,"Deep cola pour with a frothy head. Its almost weird to have something malty pouring out of a pint can. Nice, earthy, malty, with root beer candies and some brown sugar. Nice balance of malt (earthy, unsweetened chocolate, root beer candies) and some hops to temper on the finish. Mouth feel is spot on, as usual. Definitely well above average for this style.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
2015,"2016-10-19",4.2,"Canned 9/28/16, drunk 10/6/16, thanks Nelson for sharing.Good clarity throughout this maple-mahogany body with a dark beige head atop showing strong retention.Hazelnut and walnut-laden specialty malts are balanced nicely against light honey-vanilla and moderate caramel-toffee. Theres a kiss of pine sap, lots of spicy, green hop character and zero resin or alcohol. Soft and mild with low roastiness and a touch of moderate fruitiness on the end - plums, raisins, currants. Clean, mineral and ester-rich yeast complements the nutty and fruity malts, while the hops help add some zestiness without unbalancing what should be a malt-forward style.Creamy-sweet malts are nonetheless well-attenuated, with a spicy and herbal element from the hops. Caramel, walnut, currant, plum are all evident here and provide a very by-the-books brown ale. Tight carbonation and not too much influence from the specialty malts on the texture (ie. its not hard and iced tea-like). Low bitterness, but enough to balance the malts gently. No alcohol or flaw. Soft, malty, fruity and low on the roast and bread. Reminds me a lot of Hill Farmsteads George.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2015,"2016-09-30",2.9,"16oz can. Pours brown with a negligible tan head. Aroma is nutty with a little toffee and cocoa. Taste is nutty with sweet malt, caramel, and bittersweet chocolate. Dark fruit in the finish. Lightly piney and bitter aftertaste. Light body. Soft carbonation. Thin, watery mouthfeel.","Massachusetts, USA","tapefuzz"
2015,"2016-03-28",3.3,"16 oz. can. Brown body. Smells very nutty. Caramel and some chocolate. Tastes very nutty as well. Kinda masks the caramel malts. Low sweetness. Dark roasted nuts. Hoppy bitter finish. Medium body. Pretty good.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
2015,"2016-03-24",4.1,"Canned version poured into a glass. An opaque dark brown color with a frothy tan head that settles to a thin lace. Sweet and roasty-fruity aromas. Flavor is rich and malty with lots of interesting notes of chocolate, brown sugar, molasses and cola. Dry slightly bitter finish. A very enjoyable brown ale!","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","MaBeer1972"
2015,"2016-03-20",3.5,"This brown ale is a little heavy on the dark roast and leaning porter for that reason. Malt is lacking fire my taste. The finish of the beer is dry. I like this beer but its not worth standing in line for like you might fit bright.","Massachusetts, USA","ludhaber"
2015,"2016-03-20",3.4,"Dark brown caramel aroma. A little harsh for a brown. Definitely not up to the hype of this brewery. March madness 2016","Virginia, USA","bigben873"
2015,"2016-02-21",4.0,"shared can, deep brown colour with a tanned head. sweet sticky caramel, sweet bursting toffee, fudgy, chocolate brownies, sweet toasted malts, smooth nice mouthfeel. im not a fan of brown ales at all but this is top class","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"
2015,"2016-02-08",4.0,"The beer is dark brown with a medium-small beige head. The head is somewhat fizzy and proves delicate to the ravages of about a minute of contact with the air. The aroma is nutty and toasty with a firm caramel base. Mild to moderate cola flavor. Some earthy hoppiness, milder than expected. Its clearly well made but still very much a classic brown ale. Tree House played it straight and did an excellent job. The flavors mesh well, and those nutty, toastier malt flavors get a chance to play center stage. The taste follows suit. Its mildly sweet. While the caramel sweetness makes its presence felt, the beer is a showpiece for those more interesting deeper malt flavors. Mouthfeel is very normal with a touch of creaminess. Full enough but this is a brown ale that could make an old homebrewer smile. While thats not something that I normally care about, its done very well, and the beer is quite good.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
2015,"2015-12-17",4.3,"Ill bet you cant say brown 10 times in a review. As said below, brown ale is brown. This is brown. Hence a good brown ale. Brown pour, brown head. Tastes lie brown things, caramel and brown malts. Finish is malty. Brown Brown.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"

2015,"2015-11-27",3.7,"Appearance is a straight 5 because this brown ale is brown with a light brown head. Aroma is toasty, cocoa, nuts, and light earthy hops. Taste is moderate sweet with a dry malty finish. Nice brown thats brown.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"

2015,"2015-11-18",3.7,"Growler shared by JulienHuxley, thanks dude! Pours a nice and clear brown with a small offwhite head that leaves good lacing. Nose is of nuts and toasted cereals. Taste is of roasted nuts, light sweet cereals and moderately bitter. Body is medium, carbonation moderate and it is quite tasty. Im not much of a brown ale connoisseur but it felt like it was really well crafted and very pleasing.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

2015,"2015-11-17",3.7,"growler shared by julienhuxley, thanks bro! unclear dark brown pour with a nice reviving beige cap, some retention and lacing. aromatic caramel and toffee, clean english yeast - with its butter angles; lightly spicy and earthy; dried maple syrup solids. moderate carbonation, light body - oily; semi-sweet woodsy-spicy finish. very tasty toffee-oriented brown ale. still kind of english. good.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
2015,"2015-11-16",3.9,"Appearance is more of a charcoal black, with a thin lining of mocha brown. The aroma is a juicy, dripping roast with a plum sauce, in a shading of green, needled bitterness. Purplish tannic colors, maple syrup, and tobacco earth fill in the mysterious interior. Leather, ash, limestone; earthiness pushing it.

The stylistically typical chocolate rock candy flavor is the main one. Much of the dark fruit of the aroma, but expanded; roasted blackberries, strawberry, a whiff of browned banana. The initial flavor brought a pretty bombshell tobacco savory note, but this is overwhelmed in candy sugars over time. Chestnut, pine, cedar notes detail roasted malt and hop bitterness at the same time. Finally, the same outrageous roast juiciness of the aroma is the most powerful, memorable element.

Sticky, deep palate, a bit of brisk spice through the whole thing. Conifer and maple sweetness in the late flavor, toffee and some tea like bitterness in the expanding finish. The messy, raw exuberance that this projects is fun and weird; that it isnt texturally perfect or delicately balanced as expected is fine.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
2015,"2015-02-07",3.5,"750ml bottle in a teku. Pours brown with a lacy, beige head. Aroma of caramel and toffee malts, some light notes of chocolate and dark fruits, some light hops, and some dough. Flavor the same with a decent blend. Average texture, maybe too carbed. A decent brown ale.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
2015,"2014-12-24",3.5,"750 ml growler from the brewery shared by Mark! Typical dark brown. Aroma shows some earthy nuts, hints of caramel, English toffee and light bitter coffee. 
Flavor is as it smells. Body is on the fuller side for a brown with a decent underlying grassy bitterness that lingers after the sip. Pretty good balance of roast and hops. For the style it is finely made and show please hop head and malt people alike.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2015,"2014-12-24",3.7,"Growler, thanks Mark! Pours deep brown with an off white head. Aroma is roasted malt, spent coffee grinds. Flavor is very roasty, nearly a porter. Grassy bitter in the finish.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
2015,"2014-12-24",4.0,"A wonderfully complex brown ale with good hop overtones mixing very well with the malty sweet aftertaste. Pretty much the perfect brown ale -- NOT an IBA or whatever.","Madrid, SPAIN","CamdenD"
