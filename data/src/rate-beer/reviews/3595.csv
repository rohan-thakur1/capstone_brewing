3595,"2012-12-06",3.8,"Growler shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike!

The beer appears clear and a light apricot hue. Very little head and virtually no lacing, likely due to the growler format. Fabulous aroma with a big bouquet of fresh hops. Tropical fruits, citrus, and a lingering bitterness in the finish. Highly drinkable. Very little malt presence. Light on the palate. It would be delightful to throw back several pints of this.

Serving type: growler

3595,"2012-06-02",4.1,"Great head on this archetypal pale. Comes across like the single version of Pliny the Elder super exciting hop character in the nose, weedy. The same thing hits the mouth and fades to a mysterious sweetness, part malt part something else. Dry hop to the maximum.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Alphadelic"
3595,"2012-02-04",3.7,"Huge thanks to daysinthewake for sending this growler my way. Served in a Russian River TION goblet.

Pours a clear light peach color with a thin white head that recedes quickly without leaving much lacing. Im not convinced this is due to the serving format, as the carbonation was perfect. The nose has loads of tropical fruits and a bit of citrus backing it all up. Strong hop nose without any real malt presence. The flavor isnt quite as pungent, but still very nice. Light, thin body with ample carbonation and a moderate bitterness. Semi-dry finish. Really excellent; Id love more beers like this on the market.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
3595,"2011-11-18",3.3,"On tap at Horse Brass Pub with mcberko, pours a golden yellow with a white dissipating head. Aroma of lemon zest, orange peel, some grass and English malts. Flavour of lemon zest, orange peel, citrus hops, English malts, bread and grass. Palate is lightly bitter. Good example of this style.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Matts_Property"
3595,"2011-11-14",2.9,"On tap at Horse Brass Pub in Portland, split with Matts_Property, pours a hazy golden yellow with a small white head. Aroma of English malts, mild hops and toasted bread. Flavour of English malts and English hops, toasted bread, with a semi-sweet, dry finish. Decent for the style.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
3595,"2011-11-01",4.3,"Sampled on tap at Russian River on 10/17/2011. This pale ale/bitter pours a somewhat cloudy light orange gold color from the tap. Medium sized white foamy head, with nice lacing and good retention. The aroma is fruity, sweet, hoppy and citrusy. A medium bodied bitter. The malts are fruity and sweet, apricots and oranges. The hops are grapefruity and citrusy, with a touch of piney hops as well. Lively carbonation. Lots of hop bitterness. Nicely balanced. Crisp and clean. Light and refreshing. A very nice hoppy session beer. I think Don would have liked this one. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and crisp. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
3595,"2011-10-30",3.8,"Tap @ Horse Brass on their 35th Anniversary...  Poured golden orange with a thin, white head into the imperial pint glass.  Nice palate, not overly dry or carbonated.  Some great hop earthiness with citrus, pine, and tea leaf herbalness. Malta supported nicely with some balance and a vegetable spiced quality.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
3595,"2011-10-29",3.5,"draft. lightly hazed gold.  noble hop-like nose: mildly pungent with dried citrus rind and stewed pale malt.  light sweetness up front, sizzling and prickly carbonation combined with buzzing hop acid tingles the tongue and palate.  thin, drying finish of stewed grains with a small celery wet hop note.  bit of a lager bite (almost a twang) late.  decent.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3595,"2011-10-25",3.9,"Growler.  Pours a clear reddish amber with a small white head that sticks around for a while and leaves a lot of small spots of lacing on the glass.  The aroma is lots of citrus hops, grapefruit, pine, lemon, a bit of sugar cookie, and some graham cracker.  The initial taste has a light grapefruit sweetness, then comes some pine, sugar cookie, and some caramel.  The finish is on the dry side with a decent bitterness.  Fairly light bodied with medium carbonation.  Another great Russian River beer.","Berkeley, California, USA","jethrodium"
3595,"2011-10-22",3.5,"growler... medium gold, big copper tint, not a fan of the color, great carbonation for a growler, big off white head, good retention and lace... the nose is mostly hoppy, light dank, a little soap... tastes mostly hoppy, reminds me of a hoppy lager, malt backbone is a bit of bitter, bit of a weird finish Im not a huge fan of, but pretty solid over all","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
3595,"2011-10-14",4.0,"On tap at the brewpub. It pours a nice effervescent gold color with a white head. The aroma is fantastic with lots of mango, orange, and grapefruit. Very juicy and fresh. The flavor is the same. The body is light, but ithas a full, juicy mouthfeel. The finish is only mildly bitter. very tasty and refreshing.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3595,"2011-10-11",3.9,"Draft @ Russian River. Pours a bright, clear, effervescent golden-orange color; fine-bubbled off-white head with nice lacing. Juicy grapefruit and orange hop character in the aroma, with a very dry, almost stripped core (a touch hollow). Medium body; medium-high CO2; some nice yeast red fruit along with plenty of fresh, juicy citrus and orangey hop character; like biting into a fresh orange; great American hop profile with a dry malt core. Medium-length finish: grapefruit and orange hop bitterness with a quiet toastiness. Delicious.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
