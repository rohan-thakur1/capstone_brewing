A: Pours a hazy burnt toffee ale with a single finger of peanut head which dissipates quickly to leave a sheet of the same. Spotty lacing. when agitated, a full finger of fluff sticks around for a few minutes.

S: Initially, floral and metallic. Followed up by sweet belgian sugar, malts and earthy yeast. Some hints of green apple skins. Afraid this would not really benefit from more time in the bottle (and Im unsure of the age on this).

T: Sweet, yeasty, see above. At the back end, the alcohol sharpens and even stabs! Havent had anything this alcoholic in some time. Afraid this would not really benefit from more time in the bottle (and Im unsure of the age on this).

M: Medium-lo body with seltzer carbonation. The beer is a bit light on the palate for my preference in a quad. Leaves slick in the mouth.

O: A far cry from the quality Ive come to expect from Allagash. The beer is poorly balanced and overly alcoholic. With a mouthfeel inconsistent with the styles big dogs, this beer nearly disappoints. Last time I will buy this one.

Nose is very dense, dulled malt, still a little sweet under the alcohol, very rich and grapey, intense, some very fruit and minerally yeast, muddled caramel.  Pours a turbid, murky brown with little head.   Taste is sweet but its under control, smooth yeast overwhelming all hops, some nice sugar afters, a lot of very genteel and rounded alcohol.  There really is a wonderful... adult, refined quality here, the sort of aging and distillation found in an old port or brandy, the medium-full body is as smooth as anything liquid.

Warming alcohol was prevalent in the flavor almost immediately, then the aroma notes, with more pronounced tartness and candy sweetness, moderate to low hop bitterness, a little less than medium body, and closer to soft carbonation, which together prompted the perception of a little thinness in the texture.

2294,"2011-03-27",3.4,"The beer pours a very untypical color for a quad forcing me to ask the bartender if I was given the right drink. It is a super light brown with tons of amber highlights. Its almost totally redish in the light. The head is light tan, super foamy with good retention and lacing. 

The aroma is pretty light, you get mostly bourbon on the front, sweet closes (no yummy malts), and an on oaky finish. It smells ok, just weird for a quad.

The taste keeps up the weirdness. When I think quad I want dark fig malts etc. All you get is oak and alcohol.

The feel is way to warm and has a weird aftertaste.

2294,"2011-03-24",4.8,"Decanted into a wide-mouthed, stemmed glass from a corked 750ml bottle.

The Four pours a hazy reddish orange that glows like the sun against the light.  A huge vanilla colored head easily erects into a cloud-like froth.  It hangs around for several minutes and leaves thick lacing behind.  

The aroma starts mild, you really have to dip your nose into the glass to pick up its nuances.  It smells of sweet malts, light hops, and tons of fruity esters that remind me of bananas and tropical fruits.  There is the slightest hing of alcohol, too.  Once the head dissipates, though, the aromas really come alive.  

Palate is clean and full, with layers of flavors that arrange themselves perfectly.  I can feel it all over my tongue, mouth, lips, everywhere.  Theres a good amount of carbonation to keep things lively.  Malty flavors throughout, with medium hop bitterness, a little biscuit, toasted malt, dark fruits, and maybe some red currants.  Hints of butterscotch, too.  The beer finishes with a heavy malt presence, similar to a scotch ale or wee heavy.  The experience never shows the beers 10% ABV.  

This another great offering from Allagash.  A very flavorful, unique, drinkable beer.  Not a session beer, but it can go with or without food.  Its so heady in its appearance, aroma, palate, and taste.  Ill definitely buy a couple of bottles for the cellar.","Georgia, USA","ameltzer"

Sitting for the cellar for far too long I finally got this out of the back of a fridge. An excellent beer it was a little too pricey to pick up again with so many other choices. Regardless I would not hesitate to drink more if somebody was to open a bottle at a tasting or elsewhere. Allagash has yet to make a beer that has really disappointed me.

Aroma / Appearance - The rosy bronze body was dim as it absorbed most of the ambient light. A mildly dirty white head coupled with a sheet of delicate film added more depth. The scent of white grape juice combined with vanilla, caramel, roses just past their prime, and a little bit of hoppiness were not as robust as I was expecting. Regardless it was still reasonably well balanced and inviting.

Flavor / Palate - Caramel, cherry cordial, and chocolate mousse give this a dessert like touch. A dry maple syrup wraps up the experience with a little ribbon. The alcoholic tone does eventually break through after a few sips. I can only guess there are more hops when this is fresh but in its current state the results are far from disappointing. I would probably choose other quads when shopping around but at $11.99 the price was not too bad.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

A- Translucent Mahogany body that pours with a 2 finger creamy off-white head. Head fades to a thick collar and retains well but very little lacing is left behind in the glass. When held up to the light one can see that the cloudiness is thick and uniform and the red hues shine a bit more.

S- Belgian candi sugar, molasses, dark fruits (perhaps raisin), and dates hit the nose first-all pretty well balanced. Behind this is a faint spiciness and a looming smell of alcohol. The nose is very complex, but is very mild overall. Nothing is overpowering.

T-The flavor is much like the smell. Upfront are candi sugars, dates, dark fruits, and molasses all with pretty equal strength. Behind this is a complex malt and yeast combination that can be tasted more if you let the sip linger in your mouth (chocolate and toffee come through as well as a sweet bready flavor). A nice touch of spicy hop flavor is added to the finish and this is where the alcohol has a slight bite. Left to linger is something that resembles a vanilla creaminess, a touch of spicy hop flavor, a mild alcohol bitterness, and faint remnants of everything else. The character of this brew if very complex yet somewhat mild.

P-A medium, but ever tingly carbonation and a body rich in yeast. Extraordinarily smooth and creamy.

O- This is a very nice Quad. Very complex and somewhat mild...there are flavors here that are much more complex than my palate. This is what I imagine a great Quad to be. The alcohol is there...but it is much milder than in other examples of this style I have tried. Probably my favorite from Allagash so far...I will pick this up again.

Aroma is so malty it just tickles the nose.   Taste is a pleasure.  Malts play on the palate and the hops bite.  There is alcohol taste in the undertones but it borders on a whiskey feel to the palate that is awesome.  Ill look for it again.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","cfrancis"
2294,"2010-04-18",3.4,"2008 Bottle served into a Belgian Tulip glass. Cloudy Brown color, very murky looking with a frothy thick head. Picking up orange peel in the aroma with some alcohol tones that remind me of rum. More orange flavors, with some earthy malt characteristics. Alcohol presence definitely noted in the taste.  Well carbonated, full bodied. Big alcohol finish lingers on for a bit. Very nice sipping beer if you can look past the predominant alcohol flavors. Might even consider aging this beer longer.","Miamisburg, Ohio, USA","chaz01"

2294,"2010-04-04",3.4,"750 mL bottle served- to myself- insert nipple twisting gasp here- in a trappist glass (I just supassed the 75 character limit here- but this is an HONEST review...)  poured a moderately oblong (huh?)  brown that was 66.8 percent transparent into black, moderatedly lacing from a 2.7 mm off tan head.  Aroma could be described as candy sugar (not candi sugar)  interlaced with a caramel malt.  It will hit your mouth from the full bottle sample, not the 1.8 oz. sample, as a beer, but will identify a malt laced with a lab added sugar (sucrose, not dextrose), the middle holds approximately 99.7% of the malt where the ""majickal"" process of trans-ementaltranslucification occurs where little merry blue men take your tongue for a ride off the 1.7 oz. side, off to where Obama says its ALL GOOD... and then it takes you to where your seat feels like a giant marshmellow, and then you are loved by everyone, and then...THEN...(cough cough)... sorry, the joke is on you, not me.

2294,"2010-01-08",4.2,"Pours a medium-dark brown with a huge, fluffy white head. The beer is a little hazy and is not see-through. A great looking beer.

Smell is dark fruits, lots of raisins and some Belgian yeast.

The taste has some dark fruits, as well as some caramel malt and some sweetness which I guess is from the candi sugar. I dont get any alcohol in the flavor. It cant be easy to hide all the alcohol flavor and aroma in a 10 percent beer, but Allagash has pulled it off. The beer does give you a warming sensation in your chest, absolutely wonderful.

As large as the head was, the beer is not that carbonated which I really appreciate. The beer is not that thick in the mouthfeel, making it easy to drink. At 10 percent, this is very drinkable and could be dangerous since you cant taste any of the alcohol. A great beer.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"

2294,"2009-09-25",3.6,"I decided to purchase this 11$ bottle at Macs on West Peachtree. Batch #19. I hope it is good. Looks pretty good; has a nice fluffy head that settles out to a relatively thin head, and has a nice deep dark brown caramel color. Seems to have an almost light sour aroma to it, but then again I get this darker fruit-type aroma. The lighter aroma I was speaking of is probably due to the hops used? Ah...there she is. The beer just needed a little oxygen I guess. The dark fruits and yeast are coming out a wee bit more, now that it has had time to warm up. Still, I dont feel the beer is as aromatic as it should be, atleast for a quad. The flavor is a lot better than the aroma (one would hope). Dark fruits and yeast flavors dominate. Not a large hop present, but you feel it slightly towards the end. Not an overpowering quad, as I like them to be. A little too carbonated for me, as the carbonation bite steals some of the flavor. I am a bit picky when it comes to quads being over carbonated. Overall, great taste, but I think other quads are better.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

2294,"2009-08-09",3.6,"She poured murky browns tinged with orange amber highlights. Her khaki head is super-soft, lazily fading into a thin film. She swirls, but to no avail. On the other hand, I appear to have awoken a sleeping giant as her nose lets out a loud bellow and firmly grabs hold of my olfactory senses. Sweet maple and toffee lay next to crunchy cooked honey which has started to cool in the night air. There is a hearty punch of alcohol heat in the back of her nose, but she is quickly subdued by a cornucopia of tropical and fall fruits. Orange and tangerine citric skins bitter and dry with sweet fruity esters of fall red apples plucked from the orchard. Green grass and bales of hay keep me close to the earth while cinnamon sticks, nutmeg, splintered wood, and bulging oak barrels fill out her nose. Divinity has descended unto my glass for I sure have no other explanation for the seemingly limitless bounty of her brown nectar. Seeing as my olfactory senses have been well sated, my lips and palate are begging for their turn. I gleefully oblige. Sweet and sticky bleeds into drying wood, brown spices, and cinnamon while her alcohol warms my breath. My chest is aglow and my tastebuds are smiling; life is good. Thick and mouth-coating without being cloying, sweet maple, toffee, and caramel goodness melts in my mouth, not my hands. Her finish is definitely all about the dry side of her palate, creating the perfect marriage of thirst-quenching and thirst-inducing. Her warmth continues to permeate my body with brown spices, dry wood, and rum soaked barrels resting in fields of wilting hay and grass. Content, I lay my pen down and slowly savor the rest of our time together.


Allagash is one of Americas premier Belgian-style breweries, ranking right up there with Ommegang and a small handful of others who exclusively brew in Belgian tradition. Being the Belgian geek that I am, all is well in my world. The Allagash Four is yet another excellent contribution to their beery portfolio.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

2294,"2009-06-08",3.5,"Brillian orange-amber, highly carbonated, ok head. Pleasant riffs of crystal malts surrounded by moderating hoppiness introduce themselves to the nose After several minutes of aeration and warming, small pulses of phenols with light cloviness arise as well. Medium-amber crystal body, with crystal candi sugar sweetness and medium hop bitterness. Alcohol is well-masked to the palate, though the gut feels the punch. Phenolic syrupiness on the finish. A vein of Belgian funk runs throughout the experience. Waves of crystal malt and phenols push on.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"

Pours a hazy, dark amber orange body with an inch thick, dense and creamy, beige colored head that dissipates very slowly and leaves tons of gorgeous, layered lacing. A very nice looking quad. Aroma is big on the chocolate, prunes and plums, and toffees with lots of vinous, ripe fruits. Some soft spices and floral hops with a nice yeasty nose. A touch of vanilla and some light maple syrup. Flavor is similar with a great, softly spiced balance throughout with a sweet malt, somewhat sugary taste. Lots of florals, big prunes and raisins, plum-citrus, caramels, chocolates, and yeast. Finishes soft and dry with a light to moderate bitterness. Sweet and malty linger. Palate is medium to full and quite complex. Overall, big fan of this quad.

2294,"2009-05-16",4.0,"(750 ml bottle from Julios Liquors, cellared for 1 yr. after purchase) Pours dark slightly rubyish amber, a little hazy. Two fingers of light tan head. Aroma has some Band-Aid, at least initially, along with an almost lemony tang and some candy sweetness. Mouthfeel is initially a bit fizzy, then this dissipates to an almost velvety smoothness. Light weepy rings of lacing melt away quickly. Flavor features an almost sweet and sour quality with candy-like sweetness, light fruits and hints of citrus. There is a bit of chocolate lurking underneath. Didnt really improve much in complexity or richness as it got warmer and I got deeper into the bottle (as big Belgian-styles sometimes do).

It pored an amber brown with a small but nice looking head. The head went down quickly after the pour. It was malty on first taste but it was also cold and that seemed to be masking some the real flavor. As the drinking went on the wonderful bouquette and flavor came through. I picked up raisin, some mild nut, and lots of yeast and malt. It really just kept getting better, and better and better. Wonderful beer. I was fully impressed by the end of the experience.

Bready-Belgian characteristics/spices in the nose.  Dark fruits, brown sugar, caramel all find their way onto the palate.

Creamy body with tight carbonation that becomes more tamed as it sits and warms. Mild citric notes upfront, giving off some citrus fruit subtleties. Then comes the dark Belgian malt character giving way to figs, prunes, slightly sticky brown sugar sweetness, and a more spicy finish of clove and moderate peppery alcohol.

2294,"2008-05-03",4.1,"750ml caged&corked bottle. Pours a deep, murky copperish brown with amber and red highlights. The foam pours thick, cloudy, and soft. It eventually fades into almost no head and leaves very light specks of ""lace"" on the glass. The aroma is thick with fruit - banana, pineapple, sweet cherry - and has a subtle must to it, too. Notes of spice and alcohol also permeate the smell. The beer starts bready with touches of spice and cake. As the beer nears mid-palate, flavors of brandy, sweet malts, soft fruit, and spice strengthen. The middle of the tongue and back detect a light, fruity hop bitterness which is complex and complements the malty sweetness nicely. The finish also has a touch of bitterness from ethanol. It ends warmingly and medium in fullness vs. dryness. The mouthfeel is quite briskly carbonated and is playful - a nice way to lighten this otherwise thick and decadent brew. Overall, another awesome beer from Allagash.

Aroma is good but not very complex. Sugary dates provide the classic dark fruitiness, and some cookieish malt.

Nice and malty in flavor, with that ever-present date note as well as raisin and some fleshy fruit. I dont know if this beer was made with spices but there is a spicy component to the flavor. It could be peppery alcohol though.

Flavor opens up with both light and dark fruits, notably more prune, plum, banana, apple, pear, licorice, nuttiness, all working very well together. When I smelled the cork I thought the beer was going to be nothing but a big spice bomb, but I was pleasantly surprised.

More carbonation comes out on the tongue, lightening it up somewhat, but a layer of residual malt sugars and leathery yeast spice remains coated on the tongue in the finish.  More raisins, plums, and dates, spiced by some mild earthy pepper.  Molasses cookie dough and maple syrup.  The flavors are pretty good, but this one comes across a bit lifeless for me overall.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
2294,"2007-12-31",3.8,"750 ml bottle from Bevmo. Pours a murky, unfiltered medium brown color. The head is modest, off-white and lasts a fair while. The aroma is caramel sweet with rich malts, plums, and a bit of spice. The flavor is ripe with malts, dark fruits such as plums and dates, and some distinctly Belgian yeast. There is also just a touch of alcohol present in the taste, enough to take notice of--but not distract from the overall experience. The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy and the carbonation is lively and effective. This one finishes with distinctly sweet notes and a bit more alcohol. Overall: This ale comes across as un-complex, but somehow that seems to work in its favor. It should make a good accompaniment to roasted poultry. Recommended.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"

Bold, and full; well-aged.  Coating and unabashedly thick resonance on the palate.  Earthy sweetness finishes; a pulse of maple syrup, seemingly fresh from the tree.

2294,"2007-10-10",4.4,"In short: An uncharacteristic take on the Abt genre.  A great earthy/well-malted/yeasty/fruity/tralala Belgian Strong Ale
How: A few times at tasting sessions and a few 750ml bottles by myself (fresh and 1 year old).  I think I prefer it slightly aged
The look:  Clear mahogany body with small particles with a medium beige head
In long: Aroma is rather discreet yet but very enticing with hints of fruity yeast in a rich malted body.  Taste is just a bit of everything but doesnt feel all over the place.  Definitely strong and complex malt profile with cookie malts delivering rich caramel that is both spicy and earthy.  Fruity notes range from red fruits like <insertprefix>berries to the darker figs, dates and friends.  The leafy hops do their balancing job but the focus remains on the malt and yeast profile.  Overall feels rather sweet with its brown sugared caramel.  The alcohol is unfortunately apparent and thats about the only bad thing I can say about this beer.

Its a soft but complex beer. I liked it quite well, but I found it couldnt match the complexity or depth of the exemplary, authentic Trappist quads in this tasting.

Flavor:  Lots of sweet maltiness upfront with notes of dark bread, walnuts, and graham crackers.  Brown sugar, caramel, toffee, and belgian candi sugar all tie together with the malt.  Fruit is more apple-like in the taste with a bit of green apple tartness, raisins, and plums.  Some peppery spiciness with notes of clove and cinnamon.  Alcohol comes forward as it warms.  Dry finish.  Palate:  Medium-high bodied.  Moderate carbonation.  Light alcohol warming in back of mouth.  Overall:  Great beer.  Not sure if this is really an Abbey Quad, but it was still a great beer to cap off my night.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","RagallachMC"

A rich lustrous deep brown body and a full cream colored head make it immediately attractive. But the yeast and malt of the aroma let you know its going to be quad-tastic! Once you let it breathe, its complexity comes through, with the expected sugar and caramel but also some lovely notes of plum, clove, chocolate, and oak.

The last of the Allagash beers I have tried, except for bruin and BA 4, i was eagerly anticipating this one.  The cork popped off without too much pulling, but it did not blow off as I thought it might have.  Reddish brown color pour.  Smell is sweet, some hops, malts, sugars, and rich.  Taste is smooth and fruity, sweet, with a light CO2 presence.  Not hoppy, but just a nice beer.  Has the taste of all allagash beers yeast, quite good.

Yeast, sweet malts were also predominant flavors, with some light hoppiness present.  A very smooth and creamy mouthfeel with a fairly dry finish.  Pretty well-balanced overall.

Oaky and vanillaish notes with a light white grapiness.  There is also a soft yeasty spiciness through the middle.  Lightly Belgian character of the yeast plays off the softly peppery ethanol.  Finish is oaky and vineous.  This really drinks more like a full-bodied white wine than and other beer Ive ever come across.  Some lace clings to the glass all the way down.  I spent a few hours with this bottle and it was great.  As it warms, the yeasty complexity takes a front seat compared with the earlier emphasis on the barrel aging.

2294,"2006-07-21",3.8,"Bottle.  Pours a ruby red color with a foamy/soapy looking head that fizzed a ton.  Nose was spicy (vanilla) and malty and smelled a little bit like limes (seems odd) and sour cherries.  There was also a little alcohol in the aroma, and not nearly as much as Id expected.  Great creamy flavor (butter and toffee) that has excellent body with sweetness up fron that gives away to bitterness and then alcohol.  Definite cherries in the flavor, and maybe even a bit nutty.  Mouthfeel is thick and full, but a bit more oily than I personally like, great bubbles though.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","nhorween"
2294,"2006-06-24",4.0,"Mine exploded like a shaken champagne bottle.  Fortunately, applying direct pressure staunched the bleeding for the most part, leaving me with only a neck full of foam.  It poured surprisingly gently after that, medium brown with only an average head.  Aroma was earthy, with a hint of sweetness, also spices, yeasty goodness and other trace scents that I couldnt identify.  In the mouth, it started with a hint of sour.  In the mouth theres definite sweet and spicy, followed by a balanced finish, earthy and dry.  Its a little oily in the mouth, with moderate to full carbonation.  A hint of alcohol warming.

2294,"2006-05-28",4.1,"From a 750ml. brown bottle with no bottled/freshness date, sampled at cellar temperature in a chalice.

Made a good appearance, poured a cloudy apple cider amber with a foamy beige head that settled into a fine lacing, good smooth carbonation.

Had a freshly sliced green apple and pear fruity nose with whiffs of sweet maltiness and alcohol at the edges.

A crisp, textured and smooth medium bodied mouth feel, very good sipping drinkability.

Fresh apple and pear with a caramelized malty taste, the yeast is dryish and in the forefront, a subtle spicy and earthy hops bitterness in middle, very balanced to keep the taste smooth, for 10% ABV, the alcohol warmth is pleasing and subdued, doesnt overwhelm the other flavors in the palate, and a dry apple and sweet malty finish that lingers in the palate.

Aroma was huge on this thing - lots of dark fruits, grapes lending to a vineous quality, sweet rich malt, light earthy yeast and a spice combination that is very reminiscent of Allagashs Grand Cru.  Mouthfeel is very think and sticky with light frothy carbonation.  Taste has lots of brown sugar and caramel.  There are some earthy hops in here that become more prevalent as it warms.  More caramel and yeast are apparent as it warms as well.  The finish is sour with prevalent alcohol.  After a bit of ages I assume the alcohol on the finish would smooth out nicely.

Wow, big sugary flavors with lots of red grape notes with a touch of plum.  huge alcohol kick on the finish.  This shows that this beer could and will age wonderfully!

The palate is dense and bold, with the flavors being fruity up front (figs, plums, berries, cabernet, port) then yielding to a hoppy floral spicy candi sugary malt taste.

Lots of sweet apples, figs, and plums, some dark fruits such as raisin, and smaller amounts of citrus, and a small amount of spicyness that comes thorugh stronger in the aftertaste. Intensly sweet.

It hides the alcohol well, though the thick pour, rich flavors, and dark color do hint at whats in store.  It has good favors found in Belgian classics, with some citrus and spice backing the malts.

I would have loved for this beer to have more attenuated sugars and a fruitier aroma à la Rocherfort 10 (I cant really have an ABT without comparing it to the best).

The nose on this beer is complex and inviting, with a multitude of aromas that invite you in. Waves of sweet malt, ripe fruit, earthy yeast notes, and peppery alcohol flood the nose. The palate is lush and full on the tongue with complex flavors that dance on the tongue. Sweet and caramel malt flavors play against an under tone of soft ripe fruit flavors, and spicy yeast flavors. There is so much going on in this beer, you really have to savor this one to let the taste buds soak it all in. Allagash Four finishes with more complex malt, fruit and yeast notes, then ends with some herbal hop bitterness, and peppery alcohol that warms as it goes down. 

Wow. The most impressive beer from Allagash I have ever tasted, and that is saying a lot because all Allagash beers are world class. This beer is phenomenal as is, but like any good Trappist style ale, this beer will only get better with age. Some of those ""raw"", potent flavors, will mellow with age, and become deeper and more complex. Retailing for $7 a bottle, this beer is a steal, and I suggest you purchase a few bottles to drink young, and a few for your beer cellar. This beer is a fantastic after dinner beer, and would work well with hearty fare, as well as strong and sharp cheeses.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

I thought this beer would really get better with age.  Another outstanding beer from Allagash.  Rapidly becoming one of my fav brewers. Ive been holding onto a bunch of these for months.  I just couldnt bring my self to open open (if I drink one Ill only have 5 left).  Finally broke down and drank one for Thanksgiving Eve; had to rationalize it).  Anyway, aroma was great.  Even though there are four malts in this, I really didnt notice it or the hops.  What I really noticed was the cherry and ruby port.  Head was creamy, light-brown, excellent lacing, that mostly diminished.  Color was dark amber. Heavy sweet initial flavor that lessens.  Definitely can taste the malt now.  Finish was very long.  The body was not as full as some quads.  Texture was syrupy and flat with incredibly little if any alcohol finish.  One of my favorite quads.  It was very smooth without too much cherry, like Three Phils.  Very interested to see how this matures.  Now only if Allagash would distribute to Georgia.","Georgia, USA","doubleipa"

This beer couples lemony hops with pit fruit and dark chocolate. Creamy consistency in mouth. Overall a sweet ale with a very strong hop presence in back of mouth and tongue that dont seem to match each other. The final palate is actually really not that good. Alcohol is not emcumbering at all for a beer with such a high ABV. And finally, do not let the 97% overall ranking fool you.

There are bold old aromas of caramel malt, molasses, ripe banana, orange rind and alcohol, which grow stronger as the ale warms to room temperature.  Palate entry is quite sweet, but immediately tempered by a warming and drying alcohol flavor.  Mid-palate introduces the flavors suggested in the nose, but I also identify plum and raisin.  The excellent long-lasting finish is rather dry with the aforementioned alcohol and hop flourish.  I am unable to determine the bottling date for this ale, but I would imagine that it is on the youthful side and might be improved with some cellaring.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ivan9856"
2294,"2005-10-22",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 23, 2005 The uncapping of the metal wire cage, and the pulling of the cork was followed by an resounding pop, that reassured me, that the seal had held well. The beer poured out quite lovely, with a clear reddish amber body, and an unevenly rocky, large, beige head.  The aroma was very malty, with a muted spiciness.  The mouth watering smell consisted of banana, orange peel, plum, saffron, coriander, and fresh cut hay.  The scent was good, but not as prominent as typical for the great examples of the style.

The taste was generously malty, with a buttery mellowness, which I can proudly attribute to the year plus stay in my cellar.  There was also a drying presence of faded hops and subtle spices to keep the sweetness in balance.  The yeast imparted a bit of sourness as well.  The interplay between these elements presented a harmonious complexity.

The body was a little delicate for the style, but the sticky mouthfeel was enough to allow the flavors to shine through.  The maturity of the flavors concealed the sugar derived alcohols quite well.  Made a perfect nightcap, especially when paired with a wedge of semi-soft Brie cheese.  The only slight downside to the whole experience was the fact that the taste did not change very much during the consumption of the entire 750 ml. bomber.  Despite that, a very pleasing beer.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

2294,"2005-09-23",3.3,"All I have to say is, how warm are you supposed to drink this?. Everything changed in this beer depending on the temperature.  Had this to celebrate our successful completion of a TS-automotive audit.  Initially poured a murky light brown with yellowish hints and very minimal lacing.  However, as it warmed, it became clear amber and ultimately had a light head that was quick to dissipate.  The aroma was initially heavy and syrupy though as it warmed it lightened up.  The aroma generally stayed the same with alcohol, honey, minerals.  The flavor was bourbon, alcohol, fig, spices (i.e., coriander, pepper) and orange peal.  Warm alcoholic body, semi-sticky (when cold) and generally coating.  You NEED to drink this at a high red wine temp IMO.  The flavors are similar but the body is creamier and the flavors much more balanced.  Im giving it extra points for amazing transformation from cool to red wine temp...","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

Things get better as you drink more and the mustiness turns into a yeastiness, but it just doesnt win me over. Not worth buying another bottle.

This beer is big and intentionally comes across as in your face.  Lots of plum and candi sugar in this one.

It had a yeasty sweetness that faded quicky into a hoppy burn that just didnt sit well on the palate.  I would not say this quad is one of a kind.

I guess I can see that, although its like a bastard child of what I expect a quad to be, as if the illegitimate father was of a different ethnicity or something.  If I were rating to style, I might care about that, but as Im not, I have no problem saying this is a great beer.  Also, since the only quads I really know are St. Bernardus and Westy, I dont claim to be an expert on the style.  Caramel malt and roasted sour cherry with some cinnamon in the smell, but not as good as that sounds (like they arent blended correctly or something).  Musty golden raisin, orange peel, and malty alcohol on the nose as well.  Starts almost sweet like powdered sugar, transitions into some noble hop type flavorand ends mealy malty with Indan corn and a bit of sharp cherry flavor to begin the finish.  Alcohol numbs the tounge a bit, but doesnt influence the flavor that much.  Large tan-beige foam head leaves a beautiful and thick lattice of glittering sticky lacing with wide, uniform spaces in the pattern of otherwise small bubbles.  Transluscent glowing amber in the glass.  Medium to full bodied in the mouth with a smooth, even feel.  Brown sugar notes come out as the beer warms and makes the finish better and longer.

They served it in a small tulip glass and the wonderful warmth (even though the drink was chilled) and earthy, stimulating smell was just a heavenly experience. The typical fruity spice flavor of this beer had completely blended whilst contained within cask and had the consistancy of a fine beer liqueur.

Very sweet smells of fig, grape, plum, clove, banana, cherry and oak, reminds me somewhat of Avery Samaels.  This  comes off as a bit agressive at first taste.  There is still some considerable kick to it, from the alcohol or hops, its got some strong presence for the mouthfeel.  The flavor matches the strength of the mouthfeel well.  It is strong and doesnt pull any punches with a good durable taste of malt, sugary sweetness, and some fruit-like aftertaste.  The more this warms up, the more balanced it feels.  The kick seems to come in later, in tune with the sweetness of the beer.  While the malt and strong fruit character seep in first.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"

The yeast character remains in the flavor from start to finish.  Slightly acidic though, which actually makes it have a nice finish.  Well rounded quad, but lacks intensity in the aroma, and an overall smoothness in flavor that rochefort 10 has.  A well made beer, but I think this one is slightly over-priced at $10 a bottle.  Ill take thier tripel for $5 anyday over this.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

This is a big, powerful, beer in every way. Orangey hops are very evident in the aroma and the flavour. Yeast and candy sugar also in the aroma. Spice, more hops and crystallised fruit in the flavour. Very Belgian in style. Some sweetness, but also noticeable acidity on the finish. Impressed, yet somehow it seems to have less complexity and refinement than the best Belgians and I think the alcohol would get a touch intrusive had I been drinking a whole bottle rather than just a taster.

Hint of raisins, rum, vibrant hoppiness, and damp tea leaves. Abundant yeast yields notes of passionfruit and plantain. Fluffily creamy, densely spongy carbonation. Sharp alcohol tingles the sides of the cheeks, but is softened by a soft fusion of flowers, bananas, and savory yeast decadence, which thickens the body and blankets the tongue. Soft, but highly explosive juicy hops. Lush display of banana and belgian yeast nuanced with clove-spiced cake. Very vague, but noticeable,  candy sugar impression. Has a voluptuously  malty, yeasty smoothness to the body, but theres an overexerted metallic zip that lessens the overall richness. Chalky dryness increases as it reaches room temp. Juggling display of bready malts gel with a caramel and coconut essence drizzle, which revitalizes the delicate passionfruit and rounded  peach  acidity. Gorgeously yeasty aroma and flavor, and packed with a full assortment of mind-boggling subtleties, although the candy sugar remnants were a tad too apparent. Quite hoppy aroma, to boot.

Caramelic, chocolatey, marzipan-like, very sweet. Easy to pick up alcohol, but its an ABT and you dont mind that. Decent flavor balance, but just not as appealing fruitiness or yeastiness than top examples who are probably just as sweet, but manage to stuck your mind out of this thought. Full body, high carbonation a la allagash, smooth anyway. I found their tripel vastly superior, but allagash knows their brewing, no doubts about it and this will be highly enjoyable in a few years.

2294,"2004-07-24",2.9,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2004 Rating #900.   I suppose that this is a well made beer, but the bottom line for me is that it really doesnt taste all that good.  I am giving it a 5, with a benefit of doubt; since I believe it to be made to a style ie. ""American Belgian.""  At least that is what I call it.  Because no great Belgian beers actually taste like this.   This beer is hot.  It has an unpleasant astringent quality that borders on offensive to me, but on the other hand I dont want to pour it out either.  So I am sticking to the middle for flavor and aroma.  It is a nice looking beer, and the mouthfeel can be called ""velvety"" which is good.  Bottom line  - if you like the style of beer that I call ""American Belgian,"" you like that astringent heat, and you like Ommegang and Unibroue stuff - then you will love this beer.  Its not really my bag though.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"

2294,"2004-07-14",4.5,"750 ml. big ole brown Belgian-style, corked and caged bottle. If there is or was a freshness date, I did not notice it. Beautiful gold printing over a brown glass bottle makes for a great design. I might have to add this bottle to my very limited collection. Poured out a deep amber/ medium caramel candy color, with a limited, although generous eggshell colored head. Deserves to be served in an appropriate glassware, so I served it in my Chimay chalice.
Outrageous aromas of malt, hops, and yeast. Brown sugar aromas come into view as this beer warms up slightly, as does Belgian candi sugars, and I believe I detect a note of Turbinado sugar as well. The hops aromas are somewhat subdued, but the flavors are evident in the tasting. The aromas and flavors mingle on the tongue, providing a flavor-fest in the mouth. Tastes are what youd expect from a huge Belgian beer. Malts, some slightly bitter hops, yeast, and sugars abound in the flavors of this beer. Mouthfeel is rich, thick, and full. More of a meal than a beer, per se. Slightly sweet on the tongue, but just barely bordering on cloying. I believe it needs about 5 more years of aging to come into its peak. Tastes are full of flavors which become hard to describe, because of the complexity of the beer itself. This beer is deceptively drinkable, because the alcohol is well hidden at this point. It may become more evident as it ages, but only time will tell. Finishes sweet, full bodied, and very rich. Im glad I bought 2 of these delicious monsters, as I will be able to age one for several years and I will compare notes with this tasting at that point in time. You owe it to yourself, if no one else, to seek out this beer at any and all costs. A terrific Belgian-style beer from the good old USA. Whouldve thought it? I certainly didnt.","","Cobra"

2294,"2004-06-29",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2006 Beautiful two-inch light tan head atop a brilliant reddish copper body with suspended yeast particles.  Big, fruity nose of ripe apples, plum, cherries, raisins, chocolate, biscuits, light hops, dark candy sugar, yeasty, toasted bread, the occasional bubblegum phenols, and a touch of caramel.  The body is soft, supple and extremely elegant.  More luscious fruit in the flavor with a nice subdued sweetness.  The alcohol is warming, but not overpowering.  The hops provide a unique short, bitterness that I expect would mellow out with some time.  The finish is long and slightly sweet with that warming of the belly, that makes the mind happy.  Ultimately, another great Belgian from one of the best Belgian style brewers in the US of A.  I really hope this makes it to Chicago, as time will only help this gentle giant.

Highly attractive deep, cloudy garnet color, topped with a lasting, voluminous, frothy off-white head and abundant lacing.  Flavor profile is similarly intriguing, beginning with a burst of lightly tart tropical fruitiness, turning spicy and toasty with a long, sweet, toffeeish and mildly grainy finish that eventually gives way to hints of milk chocolate.

2294,"2004-05-01",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2004 Average score posted.Re-rate. Sweet candy sugar and tart yeast character to the aroma. Deep brown with tan head that recedes to cover. Simple and sweet flavour with notes of chocolate and orangeand a touch of alcohol apparent. Light, gently prickling carbonation. Goes down quickly for a 10% ABV. Bottle enjoyed with MartinT, Rastacouere and beerbuzzmontreal.Original rating (9-5-8-5-17=4.4) Sweet licorice in the nose. Malt, sweet aroma. Clear brown coloured with off-white head that lasts.  Simple, sweet flavour. Great body and wonderful smooth, creamy mouthfeel. This is rather uncomplex and straight forward but clean, sweet and emminently enjoyable. Bottle (at the ratings session post-TapNY). Dont recall who brought this along but thanks - I loved it!","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
2294,"2004-04-29",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 11, 2006 Peppery hops entangled with sweet, candyish malt...Spicy ashes render liveliness to the good malt cookie body, but this still remains uncomplex for now...The flavors are linear and slightly alcoholic and do not purport any upcoming liveliness...Lets just see how their yeast develops this concoction...3.8/5

Well, an older bottle was corked, and overly yeasty, the candyish maltiness being smothered in fruity uncleanliness...Quite disappointing coming from Allgash...3.1/5","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
2294,"2004-04-27",3.6,"This was a pretty good quad.  It poured a medium amber color with a thin white head.  The taste was balanced and the finish was smooth.  Worth a try.","Pennsylvania, USA","Prostman"
2294,"2004-04-26",4.1,"750 ml bottle, post TAP NY tasting.  Right after the Achel Extra, and a nice comparison was made.  Clear bronze, no head.  Sweet, syrupy peaches in the nose, rather ""fresh"" tasting for this style I think.  Ultra-creamy palate, interesting herbal notes throughout:  orangepeel hear, white pepper there, ah a bit of ginger and some more pungent rosemary and tarragon near the final drops.  Wonderful, for me just a tiny bit less impressive than the closer-to-style Achel.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
2294,"2004-04-24",4.1,"Big bottle.  First pour is clear amber with one inch head with staying power.  Musty aroma - earthy and sweet of composted leaves - nearly sublime.  Rich flavor:  pears and walnuts.  Up there with Ommegang's Three Philosphers - just no cherry. But this one is an extra 40% in price.","Northern Liberties, Pennsylvania, USA","pobenohne"
2294,"2004-04-20",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2005 poured a hazed cranberry-laced and lightly muddy amber color with shreaks of orange and red bleeding through..a head of small bubbles rose tall...an unsubtle aroma of pear, papaya, green raisin, dried pineapple, white pepper, coconut, and cloves flowed through the air like the salmon of Capistrano...malty introduction to a caramelized fruit salad of pears, apples, and sugarplums..firm belgian yeast notes.. waves of sweetness cut short by solid bitterness...gaseous carbination...heated alcohol..dried fruit aftertaste..quite nice.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
2294,"2004-04-19",4.2,"Lightly cloudy ruby orange color with a dense inch lid of beige bubbles. Fruity aroma. Lots of pears, bananas and pineapple with an underlying of toffee. Creamy feel. Very mellow and light for the stated heft. Flavors do match with the aromas with a touch more light candi. Almost to smooth for its own good.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
2294,"2004-04-18",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2008 Burnt reds and oranges, fluffy and thick off white head.  Nose & flavor are similar and with lots going on. Spicy bread dough, toffee, pear, fuzzy fruits, and a hint of banana.  Nice balance, with hops to round it out.  Medium bodied, fizzy end, 10% not really found anywhere. Great stuff!","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
2294,"2004-04-18",3.8,"Pours a beautiful reddish amber color.  Thick mouthfeel, not unexpected for a quad.  Strong alchohol presence, as you would expect in a quad; it is ""only"" 10% but seems even higher in the mouth feel and taste.  With four kinds of malts and four kinds of hops it is ... that's right, malty, hoppy, and complex.  Taste of dark sweet malt, toffee, sweet spice, and dried fruit.  Really nice, no question about it, but I think I preferred the bready, yeasty Allagash triple.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","WISEGUY572"
2294,"2004-04-17",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 24, 2007 Bottle... This beer rocks!... Hazy, burnt orange colored ale with a mid-sized, creamy, off-white head. Good retention. Thick, creamy lacing. The aroma is of caramel, toffee, pear, cinnamon and banana. Perfectly-balanced, malty flavor. Some caramel and toffee. Well-bittered, but not overly so. The alcohol is very well-hidden. Medium-bodied (unique for a quad) with a creamy/resiny mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Lengthy, lightly bitter, dry finish. World class brew!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2294,"2004-04-17",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2005 Poured a reddish amber color with an off white head that quickly disappeared.  Sweet and spicy hop aroma.  Also in the aroma was some sweet caramel malt and slight yeast.  Sweet and stickly hop taste.  Adaquately spiced, and a warming presence from the alcohol.  Aged nearly a year, this has improved big time from a fresh sample.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
2294,"2004-04-16",4.4,"Deep clear red, huge whitish head.  Beautiful nose, sugary and sweet, very fruity with lots of plums, peaches and apricots.  Tastes yummy, big yeasty character, malts are bready.  Subtle fruits, berries and a bit peachy.  Good hop and spice mix at the end.  Great palate, full and coaty, sticks around the mouth.  Good stuff.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
2294,"2004-04-14",4.3,"With the yeast in, it is a like a piece of copper in strange light that goes from light to black.  This beer has the perfect mouthfeel.  I should be able to give it a ""6"".
Deep caramel nose, with some bready yeast.  Sweet ending that gets sweeter and sweeter long after you finish drinking it.  A few years in the bottle will do wonders for this.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"

2294,"2004-04-12",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 8, 2004 750ml Corked ,Batch #1 I believe. Pours a beautiful amber which is cloudy and with a fiery orange hue and a thick dense and frothy head. Head settles down a bit but retains well. Fantastic aroma, sugary, malty with notes of cherries, yeast and spices like pepper and clove. Wonderful. The mouthfeel is creamy, full and smooth with a delicate feel and a lively carbonation. The flavor is also one to desire. A sugary, malty spicy treat that has a faint and enjoyable hop presence which lends a slight grassy note. No signs of the 10% abv anywhere in aroma or flavor. Not as complex or deep a flavor as some Belgian Quads we all are familiar with but I wasn't expecting that either. This is an American brew. Maybe with time it will mature a bit but it's wonderful right now in my opinion. An incredibly enjoyable flavor. This one's a winner folks. The best Allagash has brewed in my humble opinion. Way to go guys!","Cape Coral Waterfront Wonderland, Florida, USA","BierBauch"
2294,"2004-04-10",3.8,"Pours a mix of garnet and amber. Generous tan head. Nose is spice, very light sugary notes, dark fruit and malt. The taste is wonderful! Spice and yeast along with some candy sugar and malts. There is a peppery hint to it along with a fruit taste. Very carbonated mouthfeel. Has that standard Belgian style carbonation sharpness. The finish is rather mild, the carbonation notwithstanding. There's some more spice in the finish and more fruit. This is damn good, but I'm sure 6 months to a year will do wonders for this. I'll let you know next April!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
2294,"2004-04-08",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2004 Brown/orange color with a yeast aroma. Very nice spicy taste, with some fruit as well. Finishes a little bitter, with a hop taste. Really well done, easy to drink, and should age well. If I can get enough, and hold off drinking it, I'll age some.","Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA","zathrus13"
2294,"2004-04-07",4.0,"Pick up a bottle of this if you can. Wonderful yeasty, malty aroma over a light brown pour. Heavy alcohol is masked by some fruity notes (strawberries?)Wll hopped for a begian. Hard to put down, but at 10%, you shouldn't drink much of this one. A classic, unique in every way.","Beertimore, Maryland, USA","Holdwine"
2294,"2004-04-06",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 30, 2004 Heavy fruity aromas. Bubble gum. Touch of spice. Nicely hopped creating a good balance with the fruit and malt. Touch of sweetness. Carbonation gives the beer fairly lively and refreshing texture for such a high ABV beer. Ill agree with jeffc666 and label this dangerously drinkable as well  almost like sody pop. Could use some grown-up complexity, but I am enjoying it and need to slow down and drink this 750 a little more slowly. I too will go back try to pick up a bottle for aging.","Florida, USA","BeanDip"
2294,"2004-04-04",4.2,"Nice brownish color. It could use some aging. Aroma of hops and bubble gum. Really good beer. Very hoppy flavor. It finishes sweet. Will get getting some more to age.","paramus, New Jersey, USA","mkobes"
2294,"2004-04-03",4.5,"(Consumed at 60F) Beautiful sparkling red-orange body. The tan rocky head creates excellent glass lacing. The aroma is sweet with tons of yeast and dark fruit. Flavor-wise this beer is beautiful, sweet candi sugar, some spicy hops come into the picture about mid way through. The body is medium-full with slight bitterness and a little bit of a alcohol numbing. Overall an outstanding efort from Allagash. Not as complex as the Belgian Abts but dangerously drinkable. That 10% ABV is pretty uch totally hidden.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
2294,"2004-04-03",4.0,"This is worthy of some extended aging. Nice Brownish orange color. Aroma is a menage of hops, bubble gum (which I would attribute to being young), and candi. Flavor is bold. Sticky sweetness blended with lots of hop flavor, and a tad bit of bitterness. Finishes long and sweet. Will be buying a couple more.","Good Beer Bar Deprived, New Jersey, USA","MaiBockAddict"
2294,"2004-04-03",4.4,"An American craftbrewing tour de force. Aroma is plum preserves with a powerful whack of Belgian yeast, slight vinegar, and a powdery CO2 quality when sniffed in the snifter. Somewhat pheremonic. Tremendous appearance -- tall, heavy Belgian bottle with gold lettering.  Dark oak colored brew with off-white microbubble head that coats the sides of the glass nicely. Superbly balanced. Initially lightly sweet, with dark candy flavors.  It has an almost herbal bittering. Finish is lightly nut-bitter, which persists for quite a while. Sometimes it was almost too smooth.  If I had a minor complaint, it was that it sometimes grew watery or vacant in its smoothness.  Be sure to drink it warm for the full body and complexity.  If the Allagash guys see this and have a few cases which are about to expire, I'll take them off your hands.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"
2294,"2004-04-02",4.0,"Interesting - I am the 4th rater of ""4"". Pours a dark walnut brown color with a tight off-white head - decent lacing. Multi-faceted aroma - fresh fruit basket, chewing tobacco, and pepper. Alcohol (10%)is hidden extremely well. Flavor, not as rich as I had hoped. Good, hearty maltiness, just a bit thin for a Quad. Has some Cascade hoppiness to it with grapefruit esences and a bit of cotton candy sugar sweetness. The aftertaste is a bit metallic however. Still a good American Quad though. Probably would do well with some aging - I just do not have the patience!","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
2294,"2004-04-02",3.8,"750ml at 9.79 a bottle but well worth it.  enjoyed it in a chimay trappist glass.  awesome aroma of malt, fruit, and alcohol.  beautiful brown-orange color with a lasting creamy head and lasting carbonation.  super mouthfeel, best i've had in a while.  you can taste all the sugars and malt. yummy.  The box that i took this bottle out of said bottled on march 12 2004.  In my opinion, you can taste the lack of aging.  The hop bite is very evident and is the only disapointment.  this beer is good now, 2-3 years it'll be a contender with any quads and worth it's hefty price.  oh, you will feel the alcohol in this one, no doubt about it, cheers.","USA","BIGC"
2294,"2004-04-01",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2004 Woohoo, its pretty cool to be one of the first raters on a beer that is going to get a lot of exposure! I feel like Im a Hollywood beer agent; See, see, see, I discovered this! Ahhhh I didnt do shit, I just went to the store and bought an expensive bottle of beer; Im the same old looser Ive always been!    
 Pours with a foggy mahogany body and a small but dense off white head. The aroma is malty and yeast. Radiating notes of toffee, dates, raisins, and warm wheat bread covered with chopped almonds and honey butter are drawing me in. 
The flavor, the flavor, Ohhhh the f-l-a-v-o-r!! Lets talk about a cornucopia filled with all the most wonderful dark fruits in North America.. and more! Plums, apricots to no end, gooey ripened dates rolled in brown sugar, mid-summer cherries those cherries that are plump and overly ripe about to burst theyre so ripe and sweet. A fresh loaf of  dark bread, pumpernickel or a toasty dark wheat but with tangerine zest baked in to add so citric quality; a peppery spiciness, a sprinkling of cardamom, and nutmeg. The creamy palate will lift your spirit and soften your soul. Soooo very Nice!  
 I will be buying a few more bottle of this before its gone. I could do a side-by-side with any Trappist Quad and never know that this wasnt a peer. A year in my cellar would add the most amazing complexity to a brew that is already an artesian compilation!
