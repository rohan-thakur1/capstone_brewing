792,"2010-05-09",3.3,"He poured deep and dark with dirty browns and blacks lingering under a large mousey head khaki in color. Large and frothy, his head recedes in pockmarked style, leaving a thin blanket and an already impressive network of lace along the thirsty sides of my glass. A few gentle swirls release a nose equally gentle. He bespeaks of softly brushed and blanched wheat, freshly brewed cappuccino esters, chocolate graham crackers, licorice root, prunes, raisins, and a touch of char. Mingling with that char is a pleasant tinge of sweet and spicy smoke, an unexpected yet welcome addition. As a smokehead, I dont mind a little or a lot of smoke in my beer. Crackling in the back of his nose is fresh cracked pepper and cracked wheat crackers. Snapping my attention back from its beery reverie, I drink deep for my first quaff. Wow. A very smooth mouthfeel, yet another welcome attribute of the (I would assume) high proportion of wheat used in the mash. Soft, light, and frothy, she almost floats across my tastebuds, touching down every now and then to tease me with subtle notes of prunes, raisins, and plums. There is a teasing kiss of tartness underneath which reminds me of grandmas prune juice. His full mouthfeel provides a chewy brew, and I am transported to a bakers hovel, fresh loaves of pumpernickel and rye being pulled from the brick oven. A clean start matches a clean finish, with his palate wholly centered in the middle. There are faint chocolate esters that linger in my breath, but not much else. As he warms, more of his chocolate character comes forth, mingling in and out of the wheat, dark fruits, and now evident graham crackers. I dont really taste any of the smoke I detected in the nose; a minor disappointment, but not detrimental to my overall enjoyment of the Kapuziner Schwarz-Weizen.

Aroma: Big loads of over ripe bananas, sweetish bubblegum, liqueur filled dark chocolates and a definite clove presence. Nice, sharp spicy bite.

Flavor: Starts with smooth vanilla flavor with almost oaky quality. Sweet banana notes, restrained citrusy tartness. Very nice toasted/roasted malty layers, slightly tart berries at the medium. Rich dark chocolaty malts spiced up with herbal hoppy spiciness.

Mouthfeel/Palate: Medium to full body, lively carbonation, rich, dark malty mouthfeel, smooth texture.

792,"2010-01-05",2.9,"500 mL into Celebrator glass- because this beer has the profile of a doppelbock in my opinion rather than a dunkelweizen. Pours almost opaque muddy brown with a good brown, rocky head that has good retention but leaves no lacing. Looks much more serious than say Weihenstephaner dunkelweizen- which I love. Aroma is most excellent: Reeses peanut butter cups, rich milk chocolate ganache. Taste is black cherries, milk chocolate, some gross- very watered down iced tea. For some reason right after tasting this beer I had to rush to the bathroom. Im not saying this is a laxative but something made my stomach upset instantly. Okay- Im on the toilet now so false alarm. Its that feeling like when you are pretty sure you have diarrhea and you never know. Sometimes you sprint (or waddle) to the bathroom (usually a gross public bathroom off the highway in South Carolina) and then all you have is some gas. Other times you simply explode your pants. I didnt want to find out which one it would be so Im writing this review on the toilet- Uh Oh. Minus big points for giving me diarrhea (reflected under palate).","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

792,"2009-05-26",3.3,"Decent, but average beer here. It looks absolutely stunning in my Maudite class. A rich, dark (really dark) root beer brown color, nearly black. On the pour its very alive, creeping over my glass after a semi-gentle pour. It settles down to a 2"" creamy off-white head then eventually gives way to a scant 1/4"" head. First aromas were dirty pennies, wet earth, a bit of brown sugar and canteloupe. After warming up, some roasted malts start popping up, with a bit of bananna. Mouthfeel is very smooth, incredible velvety. Flavors are some light unsweetend coffee, grains, and a very light bitter finish. The bitter coffee-like finish is quite lingering actually. Very smooth going down. Overall, nothing really interesting about it. Perhaps sweltering at 105 degrees on a hot May afternoon isnt the best time to drink this.

The ""black wheat"" beer goes beyond what the typical Dunkleweizen offers.  It boasts a rich, chocolaty nose with banana bread and lightly soured fruits.  Very malty tasting, with loads of semi-sweet, dark chocolate lavishing the palate with rich flavor, with moderate breadiness and banana esters also emerging in the finish.  The chocolate flavor evolves into a more mocha-like character late in the finish.  It’s moderately sweet on the palate, but the mildly bitter roast really dries things out.  Medium in weight and carbonation.  Medium-dark brown, fairly clear in appearance for a wheat beer.  The light-tan head is a little shy, but builds to almost half an inch after the pour before settling to a thin ring.  Overall, compared to the typical Dunkleweizen, it’s considerably more chocolaty and roasty and less wheaty and estery, but as the beer’s name suggests, it’s not intended to be a Dunkleweizen.

792,"2008-06-02",4.2,"A modest and unreadable bottle (for my non-German eyes) but what an incredible drinking experience.  Deep, shaggy brown, like the silty bottom of a well soaked mud puddle.  The beers particulate matter even gives the illusion of silt.  The head is smooth and consistent like a well laid layer of light brown whipped cream.  But the fun really begins in the aroma.  Heres the grocery list I compiled as I laboriously labored over the smell: roast chicken, savory teriyaki sauce, butter, blackened fish, grilled steak char, rotisserie pork and brown sugar.  All the finest meaty flavors congregating in the same tight and confined space of a beer bottle.  Im amazed such a saintly thing can even be purchased at a lowly ""store.""  The taste is a genuine dopelleganger of the aroma.  My mouth is immediately struck by the beers uncanny mimicry of Korean ribs.  Juicy, tender and well spiced, this beer is an incredible panoramic view of flavors.  Other flavors included apple glazed pork, charcoal, cocoa powder, shwarma and sweet starchy root vegetables.  I couldnt make up ""Apple glazed pork"" if I tried, but there it is.  Add this buffet of tastes to a creamy and soothing palate and youve got an amazing and memorable beer.
