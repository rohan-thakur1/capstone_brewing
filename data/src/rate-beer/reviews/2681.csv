2681,"2016-04-29",3.8,"Bomber purchased at Holiday Wine Cellar 1.5 years ago ($5.99). POURS a nice deep amber / muddy brown hue with a good two fingers of off-white foam that soon reduces. AROMA of creamy nutty chocolate, toasted dark bread, caramel, and port wine-like sticky dark fruity notes. FLAVOR diverges somewhat from the nose with initial hoppy-fruity notes (""legacy"" hops after 1.5 years), followed by more malt-centric notes of mild chocolate, honeyed bread, brown sugar, toffee/caramel, and some stewed dark fruits. Hides the alcohol reasonably well. (89, 1023)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"
2681,"2016-04-04",3.8,"Bomber from the Davis Beer Shoppe. Pours copper with a yellowish foamy head. Aroma suggests a lot of hop and brown sugar. Med body at best.

2681,"2015-09-03",4.0,"From bomber to tulip. Aroma of biscuit malt dominates. Alcohol is fully present on the aroma - a little solventy.

2681,"2015-07-06",3.5,"Bottle from Bonita: When I saw this beer and read American strong ale there was going to be no ifs, ands, or buts about buying it. One of my favorite styles. Poured a dark burnt orange hue that was hazy and difficult to see through the liquid because of how much sediments has been stirred up. Created a thick large foam head which eventually retreated. As for the carbonation bubbles, a violent abruption of bubbles rise to the top and appeared as though it was a home brewed beer. Nose is bold with chewy malts and hops and reminds me so much of an arrogant bastard ale or the smell of a hoppy barleywine style. Aroma has traces of wood, earth, grained wheat, oats, and a pinch of hops. Upon my first sip, an initial taste of tart and bitter flavors come across as if this was an expired beer although it shows it was bottled exactly 2 months ago. I dont get what is going on with this beer because something is very off. The beer taste extremely bitter yet has an upfront sweetness that is confusing on my tongue as I am making sour faces during each sip. Definitely one of those beers to take sips cautiously because of the high alcohol content, but in my case it tends to be mainly because the flavor is off for me.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"
2681,"2015-06-23",3.3,"It seems that there are a lot of ""shill"" reviews for this beer, so I intentionally rated it a little lower to help balance the scale. For a beer to be rated so much above 4 over and over is suspicious and not reliable. Ruby red/orange pour with a nice, thick, white head that retains and leaves slight lacing. Aroma of caramel, grain, earthy, fruity, slight vegetable. Really nice overall, but not a world class beer as the ratings would indicate. A bit too bitter, but what do you expect from an American Strong? Too one dimensional, not enough focus on the yeast and malt flavors.","San Diego, California, USA","Stuedmaster"

2681,"2015-03-05",3.4,"First off, I am waaay skeptical about those 10 previous ratings for this beer. Especially considering how tight the data are and the fact that not one of those users has even close to over 100 ratings. But I digress... 22oz bomber was my weapon of choice. The pour is a light copper color and a faint haze through the center. Frothy white lacing settles to a fine 2mm layer of sticky foam. The aroma is mostly fruity esters of peach, mash syrup, hops and buttery diacetyl. Flavor is strong alcohol and sweetness up front with a solid bitterness following. Lots of caramel and toffee flavors. Finishes very strong and warm, not leaving much wiggle room to taste any other deeper flavors. I also get a bit of maple syrup and vegetable somewhere in there. Overall its an ass-kicker and a slow sipper, but still fairly enjoyable.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"

2681,"2007-04-15",3.7,"On tap at the Stone Bistro on 12/1/06: Pours a clear copper orange with a frothy well-lacing white head.  Aroma of fresh citrusy hops, waterchestnuts and some sweet toasty pale malt.  Body starts sweet and malty with a good amount of spruce and piny hop balance toward a crisp, bittersweet finish that hides the alcohol well.  Fairly drinkable for a strong ale.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
2681,"2007-03-10",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2007 Rerate:  The first time I rated this, it was my 4th rating, and I was less experienced at rating.  I tried it at the brewery again.  Everyone should visit their brewery, its fun!  1"" small bubble head. Nice hoppy aroma.  Amber color.  Well blalanced with a lean toward the hoppy side, kinda of like an IPA.  West coast hop grapefruit bitterness.  Nice.

Old rating:  I visited the oceanside ale works for a tasting.  It was fun with many people (~20) drinking and talking.  I was looking forward trying this one.  All american strong ales are great, but this one was just good, so relatively speaking its rating was brought down. 6-4-7-3-12:3.2","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"

Flavor paralled the nose malt did an exceptional job at balacing the heavy resin hops. Great carbonation, mouthfeel and silk on glass.

Hop aroma quite aggressive An alcohol character present, 
Mouthfeel: Full to very full-bodied and chewy, with a velvety, luscious texture Gentle smooth warmth from alcohol present and noticeable.  Overall Impression: An intensely flavored, big, ale.","USA","rochioli1965"
2681,"2006-10-25",3.6,"Draft at OBriens.  Dark amber with a decent head.  Lots of citrus and fruity aroma.  Hops were evident, but not grassy or piney.  Flavor was more malty with a definite hop bitterness on the finish.  Still fruity hops.  Mouthfeel was very creamy and cask like.  Very smooth with some definite alcohol flavor and a tiny bit of burn.  Not Bad.","Santee/San Diego, California, USA","fordest"

2681,"2006-09-06",4.9,"At a pub in Carlsbad called Tom Giblins, served in a british style pint glass. Humungous hop aroma, extremely pleasant !!! First sip not too bitter as I may have expected from the hop aroma. More than just a pale with tons of hops, plenty of other mild type roast and malt character. Left a giant hop (Not Bitter Hop) but hop flavor in the end. Slight alcohol warmth on the back of the throat.  A splendid effort and top notch ale","Corona, California, USA","TheBadge"
2681,"2006-06-29",4.5,"Amber, haze...cleared as glass warmed, slight floral hop nose, hoppy bitterness flowed by a huge wave of impressive malts. Five bucks a pint (OUCH) bartender said it was due to 9+ percent..didnt really think it was 9 until I had my second. Did not taste like wine or cider which was excellentt due to high %so although it did not seem like a good value it really was...amiable inception...baroque flavor in malts...solid finish...may be my highest rated","Portland, Oregon, USA","jennajlover"
2681,"2006-05-13",4.5,"3736 strong ale? dark orange and heavy malt caramel aroma with slight pepper.

2681,"2006-05-03",4.8,"On tap at pizza Port Carlsbad. Porued a copper orange with pure white dense head and finger lacing.  First sip very strong carmel no for the weak, in fact unless you have a crown by your name do not try this beer. Extreme hop flavor without citrus bitterness just loads on hop oil flavor. Extreme carmel malt flavor not sweet not to dry. Very big mouthfeel, coats your tounge and mouth for ever and perfect balance of big malt an big hops. I have rated very few at 5 this is almost there but it needs more hop aroma.","San Diego, California, USA","chargerfanjess"
