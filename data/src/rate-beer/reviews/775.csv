On pour, light brown colour, with a large tan head

Decent head, that maintains, very good lacing, looks good

Very strong smell, very strong but very appealing, can smell lots of flavours, lots of fruits from banana (and lemon), very sweet. Wheaty, toasty malts, very very earthy.

Great on the nose. A very rustic earthy smell with lots of fruits. very appealing..

First reaction from the taste is that this is a strong beer, very strong, can definitely feel the 6%. Has body and can get the taste all in the back end, the wheat and hops noted. Earthy.

 I liked this beer, not very sweet, but bitter, but not overbearing. Dark chocolate/caramel tastes, like a stout, but not quite. Roasted malts and fruit (Banana mostly), creamy undertones

Is a slow burner, definitely one to drink while relaxing in front of the box, or over a meal. In fact it was so full of delicious tastes and very filling that it was like a proper meal!

Loved it. Strongly recommended! Has character, style and taste, is rich in body, and one of the better beers I have had in a long time. Will definitely buy again, no matter the price tag of 11!..","Basel, SWITZERLAND","Drinking_77"

Selten so gelacht. Wir haben hier ein stinknormales, dunkles Hefeweizen. Mittel- bis dunkelbraun, trüb und mit reichlich Schaum. Im Aroma hefig und etwas Banane. Trotz der immerhin 6% Alk. ist der Antrunk sehr dünn geraten. Der Geschmack ist hefig-weizig, leicht bananig und langweilig eintönig. Das Röstmalz sorgt dafür, dass dieses ital. Gebräu wenigstens angenehm nachbittert. Insgesamt ja nicht schlecht, aber kein Hype, sondern ein dunkles HW der Marke STANDARD.","Köln / Cologne, GERMANY","Shaney"
