1109,"2017-02-10",4.3,"Enjoyed at a tasting at Brians house on February 08. 750 mL bottle, Blend #4. I have had this beer so many times, Im not sure how I missed rating it. The pour is a golden yellow color with a thicker white head that falls down quickly with some good lingering lace. The aroma is just great. There is a lot of stone fruit right up front with a big white wine sweetness underneath. There is a subtle oak going on and a light yeast joining citrus and lighter funk on the back end. The stone fruits really stick out on this one. The flavor is just as good. There is a ton of apricot tartness and fleshiness, a great dusty funk going on, a light white wine, and a great addition of oak. The mouth feel is just awesome. Its light, crisp, and clean with a brighter carbonation and a lingeringly tart and funky stone fruit on the aftertaste. Its a beautiful beer, and I feel I could bathe in this stuff.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

1109,"2016-12-27",4.4,"750 ml bottle from the release. Pours a mostly clear gold with a small white head that fades pretty quickly. Nice peach character in here, with lemon, white grapes, grass, oak, funk, earth, vanilla, white wine, and acidity throughout. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a tart, acidic mouthfeel, but not without sweet balance. Awesome on the palate. Really satisfying and tasty. My favorite of the first five Pulling Nails.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

1109,"2016-10-21",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 22, 2016 750 ml. Cloudy yellow. Aroma is apricot and stone fruit. Very juicy. Can tell this one is going to be sour and acidic.
