1748,"2015-09-13",3.3,"8 oz. pour, on tap at the brewerys taproom in Nordeast Minneapolis, Minnesota. Consumed on 9-10-15. Pours a clear bronze with light effervescence and a moderate amount of beige head. Nice but unspectacular appearance. Fruity-sweet aroma. Caramel scent. Nice, pleasant smell. Amber Ale flavor (I realize this is a lager). Lightly toasted malt taste. Tastes like toast with butter (but not in a diacetyl way). Crisp, lively, good lager palate. Underwhelming but reasonably well made and nice.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

1748,"2015-02-14",3.6,"At Fair State. Labeled as Vienna only, with no tea infusion. I suspect this was the base beer. I picked up no tea character at all in the normal version. Copper color; it looks right. Dry malt and bread flavors. Minimal hops, and bitter malt flavor with a dry finish. One of the better Viennas I have tried anywhere. Fair State is setting the bar for lagers in Minnesota.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
