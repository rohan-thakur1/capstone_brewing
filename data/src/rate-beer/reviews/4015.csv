This very aromatic IPA bursts with zesty citrus fruit juices over dank grassiness, an intense profile which manages to remain very drinkable.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam covers the murky yellow.
-Bitterness is kept in check, which increases drinkability.
-Tropical fruitiness spans from passionfruit to lemons, guava, mangos, etc.
-Carbonation is relatively low.

4015,"2015-08-05",4.0,"The Double Dry Hopped beers are bottled too young, reviewing this at 4 days old. the aroma jumps out of the bottle before its even poured, but a muddy, turbid brownish orange appearance goes well beyond the ""hazy dry hopped"" look that weve become accustomed to with New England IPAs.
Taste is great, juicy citrus, dank herbal quality and finishing a bit less juicy and a bit more abrasive than the base, I think this has to do with the feel on the palate as hop particles and yeast proteins are still in suspension.
still great, but even better with a few more days on it.

I personally wish theyd let it condition a bit longer before releasing, but there are others who demand these before they are even finished.","LEOMINSTER, Massachusetts, USA","silentjay1"
4015,"2015-07-31",4.6,"Pours a hazy pale-yellow color with a froth, big head.

Offers a fantastic nose of fresh cut grass, water melon and ripe orange. The hops create an intense aroma, gently balanced by bready malts. Creates a ridiculous juiciness, reminding me of fruit juice with lemon zest blending into luscious, sun bathed oranges. 

Has a medium carbonation, with a supersoft, slightly mineralic mouthfeel. This showcases the hops in the best way possible, as there are no distractions whatsoever, very refreshing on the palate.

Tastes of aqueous minerals, setting the bar for the beers incredibly soft, almost silk mouthfeel. Hops do hover above this foundation on from the very beginning, while turning a lot grassier, as the carbonation rushes through, also revealing a profound dankness with crisp lemon zest on top. The hops turn even more complex by revealing hints of ripe orange, prickly kiwi and water melon which perfectly add to the beers dankness. Finishes with a leaf inspired dryness, among which rock sugar sparkled malts turn visible for a short glance, which then get wrapped up by sour, slightly slick lemon and juicy orange.

The nose on this blows me away, revealing an amazing, crisp diversity, which is nothing but perfect. It showcases a wider variety of aromas, which all come together perfectly, leaving no desire unfullfilled. Aromas get beautifully converted into the taste, providing a fantastic mouthfeel with lemon and oranges, with an enjoyable intensity, while remaining refreshing and easy drinkable.","GERMANY","aleigator"

There is a bright white head that falls to a ring with some great lacing. The aroma is gorgeous. There is a beautiful hoppiness with a great citrus aspect and a lovely fruitiness on the back end. The flavor is mega disappointing. There is a start of citrus beauty and then it just gets dank and finishes like wet hops. It's almost like there is orange juice mixed into the beer.

4015,"2015-05-19",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 30, 2017 32oz growler filled 5/15/15 and drunk 5/17/15Hazy, soft sunset orange hues with a white head that is well-retained atop.Fruity aromatics, much like the Pier I just drank from them. Citrus (lemon rind, red grapefruit) as well as very light watermelon and light pine. All enjoyable, yet there is a persistent doughiness/blandness here that seems much stronger in this sample than in any Ive had from them recently. Malts are well-attenuated and provide light honey in the nose, as well, there is no alcohol noted. Sniffable, for days, like most Trillium pale ales, but I just cant get past the extreme haziness of alot of their beers.Again, enjoyable hoppiness to begin the beer, with a medium body overall and tight carbonation producing a creamy texture. Watermelon, grapefruit, papaya, oranges and limes are all the things you want in an APA. But as the beer progressed, doughy-like flavors built up, with some degree of astringency, severely dampening the flavor and overall experience.  As well, I found it to be too sweet, with more warming, and a bit underfermented.It sucks that the great IPA producers cant really seem to avoid this (this happens at Night Shift, Hill Farmstead, Jacks Abby, Alchemist, to name a few right off the top of my head). I know the hop particulate dosent drop out the way most yeast will. Ive stuck bottles of Jacks Abby and Trillium in the fridge for weeks without effect. Still, I think some of these beers get rushed out a bit too fast with the assumption that the cloudiness is all from the hops and not the yeast, when in fact, the beer still needs a little more time.I will admit that a little bit of haziness is rarely going to have much of an effect, and I usually look past that, but this thing was just too much. Will get a bottle and let it sit in the fridge for a while and see if that produces a better result.Need to update this one.  While I dont think it has quite the intense flavor and aroma of DDH Congress Street, its still a delicious beer and has been pretty consistent since the first and only subpar experience I had.  Very spicy, dank, dry and green with less rich, sweet juice than the Street series.  Score is based on my overall impression amongst many batches, draught, bottle and can.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
