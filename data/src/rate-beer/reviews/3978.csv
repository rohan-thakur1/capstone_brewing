Fruity onset, raisins, sourish berries, pear, with a strong and very refreshing citrus peel note, medium carbo, smooth and oily mouthfeel, smooth and velvety dark maltiness ensuing with nutty, caramelly and slightly chocolatey character, becoming roasted bitter in the end, but no coffee-like flavour: instead, the roasted bitterness is interrupted by the hops, playing their role in drying the mouth, with a resinous, peppery and lovely citrussy, aromatic quality as well as deeply bittering, lasting for a long time; alcohol warms a little bit, whisky-like, but does not become too apparent at any point. This is a beautifully crafted example of a style I admittedly have a weakness for. Cheers to Buxton, one of those new, creative English craft breweries.

Aromat: dominują nuty chmielowe (żywiczno - cytrusowe), wsparte słodką słodowością (kawa, czekolada, karmel, leciutka paloność). Niewielkie estry (wiśnie w czekoladzie) oraz ograniczona alkoholowość. Nieźle. 

Smak: wyraźna chmielowa goryczka, zrównoważona przez nuty karmelowe, kawowe i czekoladowe (gorzkie). Wyczuwalna (aczkolwiek nieprzytłaczająca) paloność z wytrawnym, lekko kwaskowym finiszem. Alkohol bardzo dobrze ukryty. Balans doprawdy idealny. 

Goryczka i odczucie w ustach: wysoka goryczka chmielowa, wsparta dodatkowo ciemnymi słodami, ale (o dziwo) tylko trochę drażniąca i umiarkowanie długa. Średnia pełnia, niskie do umiarkowanego wysycenie i lekko szorstkie oraz kwaskowe odczucie w ustach, będące pochodną ciemnych słodów i chmielu.

Pours out a stout head of thick tan foam. Settles into a thin crust of creamy malty foam.
The nose on this thing is disarming and deceptively deep and floral. Looks like a stout, smells like an IPA. Nice strong hints of ripe kiwis and passion fruit.

First mouthful is light, carbonated and hoppy. There is no syrupy heft. Something youd expect of a imperial stout or strong porter which this had every indication of being when poured out.

Only as the first few mouthfuls settles into the back of the throat does the stout experience start to kick in with a toasty, malty, barley-like bass beat. There is a soft harmony of toffee, and a hint of dark chocolate. Breathe in through your nose and let it linger in the back of your throat and you amazingly get another cheeky reminder that the brewers crafty use of aromatic hops.

The malty notes are far in the back. The flavour however, is much more balanced, with almost equal amounts of hops and malt. Especially the quite long aftertaste has lots of bitter coffee, but also initially and mid-palate there are a good amount of roasted notes, mainly chocolate. The hoppy part is tropical with lovely notes of orange. The taste is moderate to light sweet and moderate to heavy bitter.

3978,"2014-05-27",4.5,"Heres a biased rating (that luckily wont count) from a sucker for Black / Imperial IPA-s. Bottle from Tallinna Kaubamaja food department ( 3,90). Pours a super dark brown with a frothy, creamy and persistent head leaving islets on the glass wall. Aroma is truly intoxicating: fruity and floral hops (why wont they say which types?), slight touch of vanilla, vinegar and alcohol. Its something like a cocktail of ripe mango, pineapple, grapefruit and brown sugar with teaspoons of vanilla and green apple vodka (not that Ive had one) mixed by a master barman. As it warms, a more malty character comes to the fore. Strong fruity and alcoholic flavour with good bitterness. Full body, medium carbonation (that luckily almost disappears after a couple of minutes), soft and resinous mouthfeel with a slightly numbing effect on the tongue. Weirdly, I write this while listening to Black Sabbath, which I never do, but that seems to go well with the labels styling featuring what seem to be gargoyles. Id suggest sipping this mind-numbingly good but vicious and decadent beverage while watching a moronic classic, like the 1984 ""Ghostbusters"" or the 1992 ""Batman Returns"".","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Kauge"

3978,"2014-04-01",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
This fruity, resinous and chocolatey Black IPA pleases from aroma to finish, lending plenty of complexity and flavor.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A stable sheet of foam decorates the brown-edged black.
-Carbonation might be a bit zealous.
-Hop profile is more coniferous than citrusy.
-Bitterness is a blend of hop resins and malt roastiness.
-Drinkability is pretty high for the style.

3978,"2014-03-22",4.2,"Expensive beer but worth the price. My bottle from an LCBO in toronto is estimated at a couple months old, but the hops hold on hard.

Upfront tropical fruity hops are what your first introduced to on the nose but a light woodyness and cocoa come through as well. 

This wonderful cherry note on the pallet that may be part of the stout or may be a combination of the hops and the stouts flavours but its a very none candied fresh cherry. 

I am a fan of big Beers and the quality of all aspects of this beer are apparent.

Get leather and over-roasted coffee on the finish. Which is a great contrast to the fruity hop character at the start. At one point I thought black ipas would be my favorite style before getting heavily into multiple belgian styles.

3978,"2012-03-04",3.9,"Bottle, thanks to Matt W. Deep dark brown pour with a nicely lingering medium sized tan head. Nose was piney hop, citrus and roast. Flavour had notes of dark chocolate, roast, malts, citrus and some pretty robust hop bitterness. Well smothered alcohol. Dried out nicely towards the finish. A very solid and drinkable Black IPA from Buxton who now boast a top quality quiver.","Wirral, Merseyside, ENGLAND","wyzzywyz22"

3978,"2012-03-01",4.2,"The Black IPA is one of the few wholly American beer styles, but now everyone wants to get on the bandwagon. Buxton Imperial Black IPA is impressive not only for the fact its a British take on the style, but an excellent example of what can be done with it. Citrus, pine, light sweet maltiness and amazing drinkability make up the palate of this beer and they do it very well.

I received a 500ml bottle from Buxton Brewery (thanks, Mike!). I poured it into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Opaque black body with just the faintest hints of ruby red edges. Forms a creamy khaki-colored head which laces and retains very well.

Smell: Big pine notes of sticky sap and resin, coupled with raw orange fruit and hints of candy.

Taste: Buxton Imperial Black IPA has everything Im looking for in a beer of the style, mostly in that its so well-balanced. Its very bitter, slightly sweet, slightly tart and slightly dry - yet all these components blend pretty much perfectly in this palate. 

It begins with a Guinness-like palate of light coffee and chocolate notes and some porter-like qualities I might compare to cough medicine. Through the middle comes a bold flavor of sticky pine bitterness, which eventually gives way to an orange juice-like taste and tartness. The end is a crescendo of all the flavors that came before it - almost exploding with flavor on the tongue. You wouldnt think these components would work so well together, but they actually do. Its a fantastic balance of hoppy bitterness and malty sweetness. I didnt get much roasty notes on it, though, but thats okay because the end result is a tasty, delectable beer.

Drinkability: The first thing I noticed even before the taste was just of smooth and comfortable the mouthfeel was. Its soft and velvety, but not thick or syrupy. Closer to that of a porter than a stout, but does have a bit of carbonation crispness of an IPA at the end (especially with that hop bite). It was difficult to drink this beer slow because it went down so easily and was so satisfying. Its surprisingly big at 7.5% ABV, but it has the energy level that comes with a beer of the size. I think Buxton Imperial Black IPA is a versatile brew as this would be complement a meal, cheese or act as a liquid dessert. Not a perfect beer, but pretty damn close.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

3978,"2012-02-04",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2013 Re rated, tried in bottle, aroma much better, seems to be better because it?s more fizzy, probably the best smelling beer I?ve ever had Trieed on cask at the euston tap, suddenly become a very important thing for me to try these dark hoppy beers, they seem to be delicious, my grandson does not approve. This tastes wonderful, very complex hoppiness with a hint of tar, aroma is good but could do with some work.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Charlieboy"

3978,"2012-01-14",5.0,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2013 Toffee orange and Terrys chocolate orange up front on this impenetrable dark ruby-brown beer. Good sized fluffy beige head forms. Gentle carbonation and a world of flavour. Up front we get a hint of freshly ground coffee, followed swiftly by pine resin and sweet toffee malt. Then the citrus comes along to freshen the palate and finishes with a hint of earthy malt. Some chocolate, lots of hop bitterness. Its particularly drinkable for its ABV and bests the original. 
Im glad I have 500ml as 330ml wouldnt be enough. Lovely. This is up there with Axe-edge and SPA as my top Buxton brews.
