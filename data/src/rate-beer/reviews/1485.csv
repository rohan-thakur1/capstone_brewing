1485,"2012-11-22",3.8,"Pours a black color with really no head.  Aroma comes out with cocoa and roasted malts followed by some vanilla.  Taste is much less than the aroma.  Not much complexity to the taste at all with just some mild chocolate and roasted malts.  I have had this before but was hoping again for there to be much more as Founders usually has great complexity to their beers.  Mouthfeel is light to maybe medium and the carbonation is pretty good for the style.  Overall a solid beer, just expect a lot from this brewery, which is a great thing!!","Wisconsin, USA","OnWisconsin"
1485,"2011-07-02",3.9,"Sampled at the brewery in the summer of 09.   I came across old ratings, and found this one.  Pours dark black brown in color with a head that laces across the glass  Aroma like the regular porter.  Some roasty malts, dry smelling, with red fruits - cherries, and the whiskey.  Touch of hair spray quality to the whiskey.  Thin medium creamy body.  Chocolate roast flavors with malts that become sweet with whiskey and bitter roast.  Good.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"
1485,"2010-05-28",4.1,"2/28/2010:  Founders Bourbon Barrel-Aged Porter...  Aroma:  Hersheys chocolate syrup, subtle bourbon; sweet anise; barrel char.  Appearance:  Mostly dark brown to near black in color with ruby highlights; a crown of fine brown foam gathers and then quickly disperses; opaque complexion.  Flavor:  Like a liquid high cacao dark chocolate bar blended with bourbon-soaked char shaved from the inside of the barrel and heavily creamed coffee; a wonderful blend of semi-sweet chocolate and unsweetened chocolate/cocoa in the lovely finish.  Palate:  Deeply rich and intense dark chocolate; Full-bodied; sticky on the lips, but extremely smooth going down; creamy and mellow texture; bourbon is subdued and does not overpower the beer, but does complement it nicely.  A lot like the Founders Black Biscuit, only not quite as instense or alcoholic... Overall:  The ""regular"" Founders Porter is damn good and is even better; it is ""dark, rich, and sexy"" and plenty roasty (not as much so as the regular porter) with increased complexity and character from the barrel-aging; AWESOME!
Draught (growler fill) from Party Town in Florence, Kentucky.  Rating #36 for this beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"
1485,"2010-05-13",4.2,"A: The pour is deep and dark, nearly black with a minimal mocha head on top.

S: One of those rare beers that you have a hard time getting to the drinking because it just smells so good. Full of chocolate, vanilla, a hint of bourbon, and an almost oatmeal cookie-like aroma.

T: The sweet vanilla is very intense and works wonders with the chocolate, mild roast, and smooth bourbon flavors.

M: A medium bodied beer with a really smooth mouthfeel and low carbonation. I dont know if that was by design or from the growler, but I like it.

D: Another in a long line of awesome beers from Founders. I need to make it out to Michigan one of these days.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

He poured me a regular porter. when I got the correct one, I was poured a deep black porter sporting a dark tan head, with roasty notes of caramel, oak, molasses and chocolate.

1485,"2010-02-06",4.3,"Dark brown almost black with a brown tanish very thin head. Medium to full bodied. Nose is of an imperial stout. Bourbon, coffee, and lots of roastyness to it. Im not a fan of porters but wow is this a great beer. This is an awesome beer if your into imperial stouts even though its not. It tastes like one. This is what their imperial stout should be. Roast, roast, and more roast with some coffee and bourbon notes balancing with a sweet almost chocolate like flavor with a robust roasty long lingering finish.","Stoutville, Illinois, USA","StoutFest"
1485,"2010-02-06",3.6,"Poured from a tap at Founders. Black with no head, no lacing.  Aromas of chocolate,  caramel and roasted malt with a strong whiff of alcohol. The taste was lightly sweet and alcoholic, and the palate was full-bodied, smooth, and sexy with a lingering finish. It reminded me of a more alcoholic version of Founders Porter. Enjoyable.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","pauls_parade"

1485,"2008-12-30",3.5,"Snifter on nitro from the new brewery.  Dark brown with thick, creamy tan head and some lacing.  Aroma is big bourbon and sweet roasted malt.

1485,"2008-08-12",3.8,"Great Taste 2008. A solid way to start the festival with this 1:00 pour. This is a very good beer, but I was a bit underwhelmed -- which is not to say this doesn’t merit a rating in the high 3s. Perhaps it’s that I’ve come to expect too much from Founders. But onto the beer: Notes of chocolate and soy blend with vanilla and toffee. The bourbon is more on the finish, nothing like the other BA porter I had -- the Dark Knight Returns -- where bourbon is everywhere. Solid, and hides its alcohol well.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
1485,"2008-08-12",4.3,"GTMW 2008.  The beer pours to a pitch black body with a tan head.  The aroma is milk chocolate and vanilla.  Sweet.

Rich sweet palate with a full body and nice texture and great coating.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"

Initially I was going to pass on this until I got a sniff of someone else’s glass.  At that point I knew that I had to give it a try.  An early special tap the extra aging seems to have improved the already solid porter.  Unlike some beers which end up unbalanced this had a nice blend of base beer and barrel aging.

Aroma / Appearance - The black body had the tan lacing you would expect of a thick porter or stout.  The bourbon and vanilla notes stand out first but do not dominate the underlying dark chocolate.  Very balanced this was a delight to savor.

Flavor / Palate - The first sip was a blend of peanut butter and chocolate.  It then morphed into a woody rye aftertaste with dryness in the finish.  Founder’s has improved on a alreadty solid beer by laying it down.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
1485,"2008-08-10",3.8,"Small sample, on tap at Great Taste of the Midwest. Consumed on 8-9-2008. Pours dark brown with tan head.

Lively and a little oily in the palate.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

1485,"2008-08-10",4.2,"On tap at GTMW.  Poured black with a creamy, deep brown head.. nice.  The aroma picked up rich dark chocolate and vanilla upfront.. toasty oak and sweet bourbon joined the chocolate on the back-end.  The flavor had dark chocolate all over with a very good bourbon/barrel impression (sweet vanilla and tasty bourbon were quite well integrated and let the malts do their thing).. drier finish picked up some coffee bitterness.  Medium-bodied and well-balanced on the palate with spicy oak on the memorable finish.  Excellent brew!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1485,"2008-08-10",4.3,"On tap at MIBGSF 08.   Pours black with a tiny tan colored head.   Aroma is oak, bourbon, chocolate, caramel.   Flavor is nice hint of oak, bourbon, and vanilla, on top of the chocolate, caramel, roast, coffee notes of the original beer.   Palate is full bodied, mild carbonation, finished sweet and mildly warming.  This is fantastic use of Woodford barrels, the bourbon just supurbly compliments an already fantastic beer!   Hopefully this gets bottled one day as I know the porter is scheduled to be released for the first time in a long time this year.   Terrific stuff!!","Ohio, USA","ogglethorp"

1485,"2008-08-04",3.9,"Deep, rich chocolate brown with tan head that fades quickly.   Big bourbony nose, along with the requisite  dark roasted malts and coffee.   These notes are all present and accounted for in the flavor as well as nuts, vanilla, espresso, and oak.   There is a somewhat distracting (to me anyway) lactic note...a kind of sour or tart twang that I detracted points for, but still damn fine brewing on all levels.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
1485,"2008-08-01",4.2,"Sample at the Summer MGBF ’08.  Pours dark brown/ black with a decent sized beige head.  The aroma is roasted malt, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, and a touch of espresso.  The flavor, which is bold has moderately sweet dark malts, vanilla, oak, slight bourbon, dark chocolate, and a touch of the espresso from the nose.  The bitterness in the finish probably arises from the dark chocolate influence.  This was way to easy to drink for a 9.5% porter.  Mouthfeel was spot on.  Definetly worthwhile.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"

Slightly syrupy and heavy oily mouth feel, surprising for the genre for sure. A very YUMMY brew!","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
1485,"2008-07-28",4.1,"Poured at the MBG summer fest 08’.  Great looking beer.  Nose of vanilla, cream, roast and chocolate.  Taste really brought it all together.  Founders knows how to barrel age.

Nose of chocolate and coffee with a touch of molasses and alcohol, also subtle oak notes. Boozy, silky. Dry body with more prominent oak and bourbon, but still dominated by the base beer, with roasted malts, coffee, chocolate, and light vanilla flavors. Rather thin-bodied but smooth and complex.
