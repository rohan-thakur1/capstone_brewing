2079,"2016-10-30",3.8,"Draft. Candi sugar, caramel malt, and hay aroma. Dark amber with small head. Very sweet candi sugar, caramel malt, and mildly bitter/astringent green hay flavor. Good body - moderately boozy finish.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
2079,"2016-06-25",3.1,"Big thanks to moejuck for this one! It pours a dark orange amber color with a small off white head. The aroma has some sweet caramel, fruitcake and plum candy. Lots of very sweet and sugary fruit. The flavor has more baking spice, toast, dark fruit and hints of earthy hops. Low carbonation and very oily on the palate with some hints of butter. Overall, Im not all that impressed.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
2079,"2015-11-15",3.6,"On tap. Pours a clear amber with a thick white head. Aroma of sweet fruits, cherry, bready malt. Flavor of light spices, cherry, lots of fruits, light malts, musty hay. Fairly sweet and Im getting lots of fruits, especially cherry. Not exactly what I was expecting.

2079,"2015-01-10",3.7,"This beer pours a slightly murky copper-amber color with a medium thin off-white head that evaporates steadily to an outer ring. Short strings of lacing on the glass. Fruity aroma with notes of yeast and malt. Medium-bodied with flavors of herbal yeast, fruit and bready malt. The finish is fruity up front with a floral yeast aftertaste. Above average overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
2079,"2014-12-09",3.5,"750 ml bottle shared by DrSilverworm - thanks again, Chris! Pours a semi-cloudy deep amber with an off-white head. Notes of earth, grass, straw, toasted and caramel malts, leaves, and some vanilla and dark dried fruit sweetness. A dash of spice. Light-medium bodied, with medium carbonation and a dry, sweet mouthfeel. I may have gotten more out of this with a fresher palate, but its still pretty good.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2079,"2014-11-29",3.8,"750 ml bottle, 2014 edition. Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a mostly clear reddish/copper color with about an inch light tan head. Head retention is good enough, and theres a small amount of lacing. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like caramel, nuts, bready/grainy malt, sweet spices and some earthiness. Taste is similar to the aroma, but theres also the addition of some dark fruit (raisins) and peppery spice. I think the grainy, spicy and earthy flavors are the strongest. Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit coating with a good amount of soft carbonation. I thought this was good, definitely worth picking up if you come across some. $10.99 a bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
2079,"2014-11-15",3.5,"Pint on tap at the brewery, for $5. Split with Kevin C. Totally hazy dark brown red color. Thin khaki head. Some sheets and ropes of lace, kind of loose. Medium to bigger body. Smooth, kind of soft, lighter carbonation. Kind of dry finish. Full chewy body. Some dark fruity natural farmhouse type spicy graininess, and fall spices. Not overly spicy, but Im not totally sure about the combo. Gotta say, well-done for what it is, though. Moderate sweet, moderate bitter, and sort of spicy taste. Interesting, reasonably tasty stuff. Solid.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
2079,"2014-11-15",3.6,"750 ml bottle shared by Tmoney99. Pours a hazy dark amber color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have caramel, yeast, toasted malts, mild spices, herbal notes, mild bitterness to the finish, decent beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
2079,"2014-11-14",3.7,"750 ml Bottle. Poured clear dark copper color with an average frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with very good lacing. Moderate to heavy nut malt, yeast and soft hop aroma. Medium to abundant body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy balanced flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. This is a solid beer and I shared and drank it with friends.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
2079,"2014-11-11",3.6,"750 ml bottle to snifter (shared by Tmoney99). Looks good; a hazy amberish brown with very light beige head that steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells bittersweet with notes of yeast, malt, and spice. Tastes like it smells with a bit of dampness and a medium-bodied mouthfeel. Good beer.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
2079,"2014-11-05",3.7,"750ml bottle from Savor Growl ($10.99). Dark copper pour with a big light tan head and weak lacing. Aroma of light yeasty funk, sweet, nutty, earthy. Tastes are musty, caramel, little pepper, woody. Clean slightly acidic finish. Nice sipper for sitting out by a fire.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","DialSquare"
