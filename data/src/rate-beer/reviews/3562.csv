It was a deep dark purple-ish red colour with a one finger purple-ish pink colour head that dissipated fairly quickly while leaving some sparse lacing. Tart and sour with a Ribena like aroma of blueberry, blackcurrant and grape with hints of grapefruit. Tastes tart and lightly sour. Again like the aroma, the Ribena comes through with blackcurrant, blueberry and grape. There is also hints of salt. Sourness increases towards the end along with acidity.

3562,"2016-12-28",3.4,"0.33 l bottle from 뇍eergium, best before April 2017. Clear, deep bordeaux with a thin, frothy, slowly diminishing, pinkish white head. Slightly sweetish, fruity-herbal aroma of blueberry, lemongrass and some pine. Rather sour, very fruity and a bit herbal-grassy taste of blueberry, elderberry, lemongrass, pine and a touch of tea leaves, followed by a medium long, rather tart, minerally-dry and a little salty finish. Thin to medium body, rather astringent and a bit effervescent mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Quite nice, I dig the idea but I think it뇹 not really what it뇹 supposed to be. It뇹 a refreshing fruited Gose, but what has this to do with a Lassi? It뇹 tasty nevertheless, but like the mango version not really my thing.
