3294,"2017-03-05",3.3,"Great version of this unique style. Light palate and crisp with a bigger hop presence than expected. Malt backbone was Pilsner-like with some mild sweetness.","The Colony, Texas, USA","kevinator"
3294,"2016-12-06",4.1,"The beer pours mostly clear light bright yellow with a large white head. The aroma has floral hops, bright fruits, pils malt, light graininess and some fresh herbs. It has a light crisp biting body with decent amount of carbonation. The taste has the hops notes from the aroma with some fresh cut grass added and has a modest amount of dryness, but a bit richer malt than most pils. Dried herbs are big on the finish. Excellent.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
3294,"2016-12-03",4.1,"Draft at Growlers - Pours a pale golden with a resilient, foamy white head. Aroma is distinctly sweet lemon with breadiness and subtle hops. Crisp on the tongue, some of the lemon carries over but it yields to a more grassy, herbal hop marriage with sweet grain. Great take on a typically boring style of lager.","Katy, Texas, USA","Andrew196"
3294,"2016-11-10",3.8,"Tap. Pours slightly hazy yellow, large white head, creamy with food lacing. Aroma of like malt, grassy, bread, grain. Flavor is very light sweet, light bitter, grain and bread. Light body, creamy mouthfeel. Pretty nice.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3294,"2016-11-08",3.6,"Sample at Jack Browns. Pale yellow with ample head and light lacing. Smells lemony and rubbery. Flavor is pleasantly dry floral. Light and dry and s mooth.","Sandston, Virginia, USA","tia"
3294,"2016-10-29",4.0,"Draft at the Firestone XX Release. Nose is citrus, bready, with a hint of floral. Lightly hazy yellow with a big white head. Flavor is lightly bitter and malty.","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
3294,"2016-10-09",4.3,"On tap at Grinders High Noon. A fantastic collaboration beer. Pours slightly darker and with a little haze compared with Pivo Pils. Aromas and flavors of German hops, delicate bready and crusty flavors, some floral balancing and just enough bitterness to balance. An absolutely fantastic Pilsner.","Missouri, USA","jeremyh70"
3294,"2016-10-02",3.9,"32oz growler fill, from Kings Convenience, pours with a crystal clear gold body that supports a nice white head. The aroma offers up spicy hops, floral hops and an earthy cracker maltiness with some citrus and lemon around the edges. The taste delivers a pleasing load of bitter floral and citrus hoppiness. It then flows into smooth modestly sweet bready to cracker like malts. This is a pretty nice crisp flavorful brew. Solid.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
3294,"2016-09-25",3.4,"Hazy yellow pour with small white head. Aroma of malts, yeast, citrus, grains and hops. Taste of malts, citrus, grains, orange peel and hops. Medium bodied, medium carbonation, nicely balanced.","Calgary, CANADA","maley1"
3294,"2016-09-14",3.6,"On tap at Harrys Hofbrau in Redwood City, CA. Aroma is strong lemon / citronella, with earthy / herbal lozenge. Taste is overwhelmingly hops with a lemony tang but crisp and a dry finish. The Pilsner of choice for all you West Coast Hop Heads. I appreciate the stylization but ultimately not my thing.","Redwood City, California, USA","tightslice"
3294,"2016-09-13",3.8,"On tap at Hughies. Pours a hazy yellow with medium creamy white head that lasts. The aroma is strong floral and lemon zest. Medium body, honey, grass, lemon, light bitterness, very good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3294,"2016-09-09",3.4,"On tap at Capones. Poured a yellow color with a smaller sized white head. Citrus, grassy/straw, and earhty. Crisp and clean finish.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
3294,"2016-09-07",3.7,"On tap at Lunar Brewing Co, and dispensed to a Czech-pils glass displaying a clear, golden hue, with a fluffy & persistent layer of white head foam, and curtainy cling to the lacing. The nose was a touch of yeast, light sweetness, soft grain with subtle pils scent, hints of flora & spice, and a slight citrusy notion of lemon & orange. Medium bodied, with decent carbonation, the taste included a moderate but lingering, earthy bitterness, and a pleasantly dry & crisp finish. A very drinkable Pils with some welcome character.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
3294,"2016-08-28",2.9,"Hazy straw hue with a big generous fluffy white head. Pleasant doughy and grassy aroma thats a touch wheaty and pilsnerish, with a light touch of artisan white cheese...not sure if that was intentional but its not unwelcome. Big fluffy mouthfeel with a light flavor profile of Pilsner and light Belgian white wheat malts, with a very light grassy hop flavor, though with a stern earthy bitterness that overbalances. Meh.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
3294,"2016-08-27",4.0,"On draft at Tap 25. It pours a clear yellow color with a large, foamy white head. The aroma is strong with noble spicy hops. Some lemony citrus. Almost citronella like. Very potent. The flavor is smooth with pale malt and strong spicy hops. Hints of menthol and citrus. Kinda full and creamy on the palate, which I guess is due to the high gravity. It finishes dry and crisp though. Medium to high earthy/spicy bitterness. Loved it.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3294,"2016-08-17",3.9,"On tap @ Beer Revolution. Hazed straw colored beer with a tall, fluffy white head. A beer that Ive very much been looking forward to trying. Its certainly a good beer, but perhaps my expectations were a bit too high as I really wanted to get blown out of the water. Hop character is grassy and a touch herbal but has a nice soft fruit character, though that could also be some esters. Sweet bready malts, a bit of sweet biscuit dough, and some citrus zest. Light to moderate bitterness. A hint of sourdough, maybe.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3294,"2016-08-06",3.5,"On tap at Beer Run. Sweet grainy aromas, floral, grassy. Clear burnished gold with a fairly lasting white head. Pretty dry, fresh grainy flavors, earthy hops. Light bodied.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","Emeister84"
3294,"2016-07-29",3.6,"Draft. Snifter. Really? Ok. Lightly hazy gold to slow with minimal white head. Aroma is grassy with. It much else. Taste is initially very bitter with a crisp malt backbone like a German pils. Pleasant hop flavor that is initially very grassy but then shows some soft floral notes. So really nice","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
3294,"2016-07-27",2.9,"Pours a light golden yellow color with no distinct aroma. Taste is clean, crisp, cracker and wheat flavor. Dry aftertaste but very thirst quenching. Very nice for the style.","Diamond Bar, California, USA","Barreras"
3294,"2016-07-26",4.0,"Tap at Flynns in Mansfield. Well, this is what happens when you take, admittedly, not the most popular style of beer and put it in the hands of 2 of the very best brewers on the planet. They rip shit up. They set a new standard for the style. They re-define excellence within the style. This is goddamn excellent, any way you slice it. Clear yellow pour, small spotty white head. Sweet grains, a grassy edge, some fruity and grassy hop bite. Terrific beer, absolutely brilliant in its execution. West Coast, bitches. West Coast.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
3294,"2016-07-22",3.7,"On tap at Elizabeth Station, pours a hazy pale blonde with a medium white head. Aroma brings out prominent a grassy hoppy bite upfront, with dry biscuity and crackery malt. Flavour is crisp and clean, with grassy hoppiness and crisp crackery malt. Really well-constructed, thirst-quenching pils.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
3294,"2016-07-20",5.0,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2016 Since no commercial description was given, I offer you the following from a Firestone Walker press release:

""The result is STiVO, a happily arranged marriage of the STS and Pivo recipes. Our water philosophies and malt profiles were already essentially the same, and our yeast strains were pretty similar, so it really came down to how we wanted to handle the hops, and the overall weight of the beer we wanted to make, Brynildson said...Cilurzo and Brynildson ultimately split the hops down the middle between Pivos German Saphir hops and STSs Alsatian Aramis hops, both of which belong to the new wave of European hop cultivars. These hops are more similar than they are different, and they blend really well together, Brynildson said. They dont taste like fruity American hops, but theyre not like Old World Hallertau hops, either. Theyre perfect for this idea of a new age hoppy pilsner. Cilurzo and Brynildson also bumped up the front-end malt for a slightly higher gravity and a resulting ABV of 6.3%, a distinct notch above the 5.3% of STS and Pivo while still remaining dry and super drinkable. Also, like STS, STiVO was racked to kegs unfiltered and will be presented in the classic keller style, naturally carbonated and slightly hazy.""

I didnt notice all that much haze in my STiVO, at least in comparison to Wade Ritcheys outstanding Czech-style pils at Temescal Brewing, Visitation. But I was totally won over by the relatively massive dry-hopping. Agostino Arioli (Tipopils), Brynildsons inspiration and Wades mentor, would be proud, I think. Beer of the year so far...","Mountain View, California, USA","dpitinga"
3294,"2016-07-19",3.8,"Draft pour pint at Special Brews. Pours a pale golden yellow color with a constant foam head. Grassy, straw aroma, but has a fruitiness to it that keeps it inviting. Creamy body up front, mild grassy tones, but all is mild, and leaves this crushable. Seems potent for how light the beer comes off, but everything is working here. Overall, a nice beer.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
3294,"2016-07-13",2.9,"UPDATED: JUL 13, 2016 Light citrus and some mash malt. Decent balance and easy drinking.  Pours golden with good head. Light tangy finish. Tap at Sehkraft.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
3294,"2016-07-08",4.1,"Draft at EBP. Pours a hazy medium gold with a dense and creamy bright white head. Grassy, leafy nose. Creamy medium body with lively carb. Light toasty crackers under a steady wash of fresh grass and a leafy scent like a forest after a windy rain. Slight tangy notes from the yeast, just little hint of champagne way in the background. Wonderful beer.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
3294,"2016-07-07",3.6,"Draft. Medium white head atop clear straw body, nice lacing. Aroma is medium sweet, cantaloupe, some straw/lemon, bread. Taste is moderately sweet, cantaloupe, some strawberry, light straw. Soft light-medium body.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
3294,"2016-07-06",3.6,"Chucks 85th, Seattle. Light clouded yellow, thick soapy white cream. Lemony tart, grassy. Clean, lightly bittering grass. Nice clean light pils tartness. Overall a bit juicier, warm body than Id prefer in my lagers. Not ce bitter lager finish. Quite solid.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
3294,"2016-06-08",3.7,"(En fût à Firestone Walker Venice): Des arômes de cèdre, de miel et dagrumes pales. En bouche cest assez mince, collant et moyennement juteux avec une longue amertume épicée, boisée même.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
