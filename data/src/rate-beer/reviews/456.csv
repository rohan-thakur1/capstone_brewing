456,"2015-01-26",3.0,"People going nuts for this one. On nitro tap at the brewery. Pours pretty and black and smooth looking with a nice head sitting there on top. Aroma is nice: peanuts and chocolate, maybe a little roast. The flavor goes the wrong direction though. The chocolate is overly sweet, while the peanut butter taste more like just dry plain peanuts. Things dont meld together well here and you get an overly sweet AND overly bitter mess. Its worth trying I guess, but I dont get how anyone could drink more than a couple ounces of this.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"

Not much of a head, likely the result of the nitro-tap this was growlered from. Aroma is like sticking your nose in a jar of Skippys extra chunky peanut butter... Wall to wall sweet & creamy peanut butter with enough of a chocolate malt hint in the background to play that Reeses card nicely. Taste is full of more peanut butter waves, nutty chocolate, & a hint of roast. Slightly sweet without going overboard, but not so dry that it gets hard to drink; great balance of flavors here. The most ""authentic"" peanut butter aroma & flavor Ive encountered in a beer so far... This stuff was great, absolutely delicious.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
456,"2014-04-02",4.3,"Growler from a nitro tap. Shared at Jeffs. Pours dark brown with just a few bubbles for the head. Understandable since its a nitro tap growler. Huge peanut butter aroma that smells amazing. Some chocolate and coffee sneak through too. Tastes like liquid peanut butter with the chocolate building through the finish. Medium body. Hard to rate since the beer is basically flat. Drinking straight off the nitro tap would add an awesome creaminess that could push this into my top 10. It was still pretty awesome as is.

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate-heavy peanut butter and chocolate. Im a sucker for peanut butter and chocolate, so I find the aroma amazing.

456,"2014-01-25",4.0,"Nitro version on tap. Pours dark with a mild creamy foam head that dissipates. The aroma is like a reese?s peanut butter cup. In taste, I noticed a soft bitterness, cocoa, butter toffee, heavy sweet crystal malts, weak roasted carmel malt flavor, and the finish had a pleasant dryness to it. Overall this is worth a try for any peanut butter or stout fan.","Steubenville, Ohio, USA","Advocate_Ames"
456,"2014-01-13",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
This absolutely surprising PButter Stout whips up quite the dessert with its decadent peanut presence, well-positioned chocolate and caramel in a velvety mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam decorates the darkness.
-The aroma is impressively brimming with peanuts. Thankfully, the flavour profile is not as generous as that would certainly have impeded on drinkability.
-You can imagine a smoky character too, especially if you are fond of smokiness.
-Light hop bitterness is perfect since there isnt too much sweetness to balance out in the finish.
-This is not haphazardly-put-together novelty item. Its a real beer done with talent.
-When the nitro has had time to come out of the beer (growler), the peanut butter aroma is not nearly as decadent, but a jam-like fruitiness takes center stage with the chocolate. An intriguing study of the effects of nitrogen could be done with this brew.
