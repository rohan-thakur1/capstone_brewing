The initial pour resembles a good pilsner, pale straw with a loose white head; but the sweet grapefruit aroma immediately proves that this is not the case; in the mouth theres an explosion of tart, fruity, grapefruit with a grainy body; and a sharp, zesty, citrus note that carrys through into a gloriously bitter finish.
