2132,"2017-02-25",3.7,"12 oz bottle. Pours a cloudy golden orange color and topped by a dense head of off white foam that slowly recedes and joins the body below while leaving streaks of lace around the glass. The aroma is fairly complex for a blonde ale showing notes of juicy grapefruit, juniper berries, citrus hits from lemon zest and orange, spicy, peppery cedar wood, toasted biscuit malts, and soft floral and earthy bitterness from the hops. The flavor follows and is dominated up front by the grapefruit, lemon zest, oranges, and juniper berries before giving way to the spicy cedar notes from the wood and some floral hop bitterness on the back end. The toasted biscuit malt helps tie everything together. The cedar wood adds a nice dryness and peppery spice to the overall flavor. Medium bodied with balanced carbonation and pretty smooth on the palate while leading to a lengthy grapefruit, juniper, spruce, and cedar finish. Really interesting take on a typical boring style, and something I would drink again if found again. Solid blonde ale here.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

So Monnik had a Jopen thing today, with five Jopen brews on tap and some folks from that brewery on hand. And yet...this sample is clearly oxidized.
