1032,"2017-05-14",4.0,"It sounds like a slight, or maybe a back-handed compliment, to say that this beer is not different from a whole bunch of other barrel aged imperial stouts. But it¬ís a style that I love when it is done well, and it¬ís done well here. This beer pours black with a little bit of tan head. There is heavy licorice on the aroma, along with the usual oak/vanilla barrel notes and an herbal quality.

Medium to high roasty bitterness, light sweetness, full body, thick but not cloy. So much roast in this beer, making it quite distinct from other big US stouts. Loving it! Not sure if the extra roast is just the freshness or if this batch is slightly different. I might need to get a bottle or two and cellar it for a while.

1032,"2017-03-07",4.5,"This is a great beer, but it is also one of the strangest beers I¬íve ever had. It kinda smells like bacon/salami, and it does have a taste of cured meat on the finish until it warms further.

1032,"2017-03-05",4.1,"2014 vintage. Pitch pour with mild, wet sand head. Nose is very dense, off the bat is full of dried berries, and a sleek vanilla oak. Deep into the nose, you may find a desireable, peppery-pine herbaceousness, similar to thyme or eucalyptus (but not menthol-like), tons of fresh-split wood. Gentle molasses, and there¬ís almost a quality of port-barrels in it (must be the licorice). This nose conjures up a lot of imagery. Run-down barn among tall leaning reeds. I digress...

Flavor is just as powerful. You get a huge creamy texture, starting off with dried berries and extremely unique herbaceous notes, folding over into a quality of easygoing cocoa and dark brown sugar with some bitterness. Sticky linger, very dense beer. 

I was gifted this beer from a co-worker after swearing to stop rating beers. But this one was so unique that I had to write about it. This beer has been one of the most unique ones I¬íve had in a long while.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","mambossa"

1032,"2016-11-27",4.2,"So this was another stout on the Thanksgiving 2016 celebration. This was a 2014, so it had been cellared for two years. Very complex aroma and taste. Smells of raisins, malts, soy sauce, cherries, molasses, chocolate, coffee, yes, all kinds of stuff going on. But the taste was not what I was looking for. It did have a soy sauce taste, some chocolate and and heavy on the malts. There is a sour note to this beer as well. But there was too much going on I think. Was in the top three of six, but not ahead of Expedition and Bomb.

It¬ís thick as hell and looks oily & syrupy; medium, dense head that¬ís a beautiful beige and burnt umber. Smells like a bunch of dark chocolates, licorice, dark roast coffee, smoky malts, and a bit of vanilla. Smells sweeter with dark fruit notes after it warms up. Presents a strong malt backbone throughout. Initially a lot of chocolate that¬ís followed by more chocolates. The middle shows off some toasted malts, creamy vanilla, and molasses. The finish brings out all the bitter coffee notes, oak, and alcohol. At 12.2% ABV, it¬ís hard to hide the booze; the alcohol mostly shines in the finish, and it warms you on the way down. The aftertaste is a long, lingering combination of dark chocolates and coffee. With time in the glass, the molasses & licorice flavors dominate the palate with some smoky, toasty malty flavors still sticking around to balance it out. After warming up, flavors also take on a dark fruit quality reminiscent of dates, raisins, figs. Silky smooth with a bold, full, chewy; carbonation is absent; sticky on the lips and dry at the finish. Delicious and complex with a long glass life to showcase the variety of flavors.

Pours a pitch black color with a surprisingly big, spongy head.

Does smell of an earth entangled grape ripeness, which does not turn sour by any means as for a balancing, subtle integrated oak quality. A fantastic, multilayered chocolate aroma slowly evolves from scorched malts, leading to a restrained, yet enjoyable Bourbon spiciness, adding to the chocolate richness of the nose. A flowery wood bark note completes the utmost originally and well composed aromas, which get pleasantly dominated by the wine barrel and matured hops. 

Drinks with a world class mouthfeel to it, due to a huge amount of whipped cream, effectivly blending into soothing chocolate. While its carbonation is certainly on the lower end, it is still able to add a subtle, bubbly refreshment during the finish.

Tastes of chocolate dipped cherries, evolving to an even fruitier stage in which juicy, matured grapes become visible, which get wrapped up by a pungent blend of burned malts and bitter chocolate. A divine creaminess caresses the tongue while oak, licorice and burned wood bark get recognizable, tied together by a subtle wine tartness, which also produces a nice sweeter quality, enhanced by caramel and rock sugar. Cocoa nibs and matured, grassy hops provide a surprisingly aggressive hop punch during the finish, immediately soothed by the rich creaminess, while molasses, oak and milk chocolate are able to cut through.

Wow, this is certainly one of the most complex beers I¬íve ever had, which may be due to its rich chocolate maltiness, which only gets carefully accentuated by the different barrels instead of getting dominated by them. This allows to unfold a decadent, rich creaminess, shining for its very silk mouthfeel, which finds it antagonist in dry, scorched earthen malts.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1032,"2016-02-18",4.4,"Poured from bomber into a snifter
 Appearance ¬ñ The beer pours a super dark, nearly pitch black color with a two finger head of brown colored thick foam. The head has a fantastic level of retention, slowly fading over time to rings of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell ¬ñ The aroma of the beer is huge of a roasted malt smell mixed with a big showing of coffee and caramel with other notes of vanilla and chocolate being rather strong as well. Along with the these super robust aromas, comes smells of char and smoke as well as a good showing of dark fruits of raisin and prune. A bit of a boozy bourbon aroma is there as well, overall producing a smell that is very dark and roasty with a big showing of a warmingly sweet smell.
 Taste ¬ñ The taste begins as the nose would suggest with a massive dark roasted malt flavor and a good showing of coffee. There is a huge rich milk chocolate sweetness upfront which is accompanied by other sweet flavors of molasses and brown sugar. As the taste advances the roasted malt waivers ever so slightly, but with the coffee, is still the overall dominant taste of the brew. With the lightening of the roastiness (which is sorta odd to write as it is still super robust in dark flavors) comes a little bit of a raisin taste as well as a decent showing of vanilla; both of which join the other sweet and chocolate flavors quite nicely. As one may expect for a 12.2 % brew, there is a bit of a bourbon boozy taste that develops later in the tongue, which creates a nice warming feel. Flavors of char and a woody hop develop at the very end, combining with the alcohol, roasty, and sweet nicely to create rich, dark, and warming taste to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel ¬ñ The beer is thick and creamy with a very low level of carbonation level. The feel is nearly perfect for the big mix of dark, sweet and boozy flavors of the brew, coating the tongue and bathing it in all the grandiose tastes of the brew.
 Overall ¬ñ This is a very nicely crafted imperial stout. While slightly on the sweeter side all the other attributes of the brew match the sweeter and rich flavors very well. Even while sweet, it not necessarily so, and was still drinkable (in a very slow sipping way) unlike some other imperial stouts of similar strength. Overall I was rather impressed by this brew.","","Darkmagus82"

1032,"2016-01-27",4.0,"Bottle, 2009 vintage, enjoyed in 2010. Pours abyssal, bottomless black. Void-like, the darkness of this beer sucks in all light. A fizzy one-finger head the color of cardboard rises up from the inky depths slowly and dissipates after a short time. A sticky, foamy ring lingers at the edges, surrounding some oily residue. In the nose: lots of licorice, molasses, lactic dark chocolate, milk chocolate, peanuts, lightly toasted bread, caramel and malted chocolate. Very nice. This appears to be an uninfected bottle. HUZZAH! The barrel-aged characters are far more apparent here: oak, vanilla, a teeny bit of bourbon. The beer improves tremendously as it warms, as sweet plums emerge amidst light roast coffee, black licorice and toasty wheat bread. The deeper, acrid charred flavors march in slowly after the swallow and linger nicely between sips. There¬ís a great balance of complex sweet and roasty flavors here, and every sip reveals new dimensions. The body¬ís just a shade under medium, soft and smooth. It¬ís just a little thin for such a big stout. A medium, numbing carbonation caresses the tongue. The alcohol is pretty hefty at first, flaming the throat like heartburn on the way down, but this too improves as I work my way through the glass. I¬íve enjoyed the Abyss both fresh and aged now, and can say that it¬ís a beer that definitely improves with time. The heat has died down and the flavors, though not quite as bright, are nicely melded. Not mind-blowing, but definitely enjoyable.","","PartyFowle"

1032,"2016-01-21",4.1,"22oz bottle poured into a snifter. The aroma is initially a rich, dark cherry and chocolate blend with a mild molasses and coffee and a hint of licorice and leather, as well as and smokey char character (woody). The aroma turns towards a chocolate, biscuit, and toffee mix. The hue is black and opaque with a dense, soapy brown head that reduces to a mild wisp with bubbles, and leaves a light lace. The taste is highly sweet complimented by a medium high bitter. The texture is slick and smooth with a light, soft foam carbonation and a full body. The flavor profile is strong of figs and raisin up front with a chocolate and wood hint. The finish is sticky with mild alcohol warmth that cleans up with a wood resin feel and flavors of chocolate malt, tart, dark cherry, licorice and molasses with a hint of caramel and cookie.

Poured a pitch black color with two fingers of rocky, tan head. Below average spotty lacing on the sides of the glass. Below average retention. (Sight - 4.00)

Smelled boozy chocolate, roasted toffee, dark caramel, oaky vanilla, dark fruits, mainly purple grape, plum and black raspberry, dark wet cocoa, molasses, wintry spices, light licorice and faint roasty malts. (Smell - 4.50) 

First taste reminded me of a slightly stronger Obsidian Stout or Black Butte Porter. Got roasted dark chocolate, toffee, caramel, dark fruits - black raspberry and purple grape - molasses, smoky fire, char wood, oaky vanilla and licorice. (Taste - 4.25)

Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.50)

Complex and interesting aroma of dry red wine, old madera wine, cigar ashes, liquorice (apparently added), chestnuts, coffee grounds, passion fruit, port, hint of soy sauce, vague banana. Somewhat candied onset (candied figs) but very subtly so, not even becoming sweet, blue plum or grape peel, cocoa, evolving quickly into a very dry, coffeeish, bitter chocolate roasted flavour, bit resiny, with the added liquorice all the way at the back, far less prominent than I had feared, but leaving a resiny bittersweet sensation on the root of the tongue; roasted coffee and charcoal bitterness remains along with peppery hop bitterness and a glow of warming, brown rhum-like alcohol; mouthfeel is thick and oily with very soft carb, but a little bit thinner than expected (possibly due to age). Not sure if this is the way this beer is supposed to taste, but after eight years, I get no signs of oxidation whatsoever; I do assume it was sweeter and more fragrant when young, but in this condition, this works perfectly. It has gained a tartness not unlike an ¬íoud bruin¬í (Flemish red) which does make it different from most other ¬íhyped¬í RIS beers I had.

1032,"2015-08-22",4.7,"VINTAGE 2014 Pours black as tar with a rapidly dissipating chocolate brown head. Strong alcohol aroma and not much else, a hint of things to come.
Drinking it out of my favorite Duvel beer glass at about 50¬∞F. A bit thick or oily but not syrupy. I couldn¬ít find its o.g., but it is well attenuated given the 11% abv. The first taste you sense is the from the very dark roasted barley. Next comes in the alcohol mixed with delicate flavors of licorice, and a touch of vanilla and cherry. There is a nice, mildly bitter hop aftertaste. It is getting better as I write this, by time I hit the Enter button it might rank a 5.0 or that may be the alcohol getting to me.

1032,"2015-02-23",4.6,"22 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at approximately 45 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours pitch black like its namesake, and forms a fairly thick head of brown froth. Lacing is quite present.

Smell: The aroma primarily reminds me of red wine and dark chocolate, mingled together. There is a tart red grape and cherry presence, and I¬íd say around 80% - 85% cocoa dark chocolate.

Taste: At the opening, this beer follows the nose, a blast of pure slightly sour red wine with cherries and baker¬ís chocolate. As it moves along, the flavors flow into a dark yeasty bread mingled with scorched toffee, with notes of vanilla along the edges. By the finish, the flavor profile is entirely black bread, earth, and oak. As the beer warms, the flavor transitions smooth out. The barrel notes, while present, do not overtake the entire beer, and the ABV lends just a pleasant touch of warmth. 

Mouthfeel: Full and fairly creamy, though a bit thinner than one would expect for a stout this black.

Overall: Quite a good stout, showcasing both complexity and intensity of flavor. I¬ím glad I happened upon a bottle of it sitting on the shelf at a local shop as I breezed in for some birthday shopping.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

11.10.15 best after date.
Poured from a bomber into a tulip on 11.25.14.

A: I can smell it after popping the waxed cap. Licorice, deep milk chocolate, truffle, strong molasses, vanilla, and cocoa. Wow. This is so complex and unlike anything. It¬ís all blended so perfectly. The aromas aren¬ít muted either as they mix.

A: 1 finger light brown head that is retained fluffy and beautiful. Midnight black body with no red.

T: Oak, cherry, and molasses dominate. Vanilla, truffle, and milk chocolate are more subtle but still strong.

P: Creamy smooth. This isn¬ít as bubbly as other BBA stouts, which I like. It has perfect carbonation.

O: Oak is first, then molasses, slight vanilla, truffle, and chocolate in the middle. The tart finish comes out as cherry (from the cherry bark) and balances the sweetness along with the oak at the start. It does have amazing depth. I expected to get a lot of vanilla but this goes a different way. Oak wasn¬ít there in the smell but it comes out from the depths and asserts itself in the taste. Every sip seems different. Oak eventually fades to vanilla after dominating for awhile, but the middle and back end remain the same. As big as the flavors are, they¬íre not overdone. The balance is incredible.

Aromas bring to mind some of the negative components of aged american imperial stout with all the burly, sour dark notes I¬íve grown to recognize from the style at this age. The molasses and cherry bark are holding the back end together to offer a sweet cream and chocolate finish, but this is generally bad. Citrus rind and charred solvents balanced by oak barrels on a creamy, silky smooth, coating medium plus body.

I held onto about 4oz of 2013 Boulevard Imperial Stout to compare the more blended versions of this barrel aged imperial stout tasting. Good lord, the Boulevard tastes like chocolate cherry whiskey compared to this $15 bomber of let down. One of the most overrated beers I¬íve ever had. 

The problem I have with all aged hoppy stouts is the intensely harsh, overly abrasive citrus bitterness moving directly into coffee and dark chocolate with almost no blending agent. This dynamic makes for poor flavor, bringing aromas of cow shit to mind (having grown up around a cow farm).

Today, I¬ím having my second bottle that has a date of ""best after 08/16/14.""
I poured this into a snifter, here we go.
The appearance, well, it poured like motor oil and I even heard the ""glub glub"" sound as it strolls out of the bottle, (did I pour too fast, hmmm...most likely not?). The head is about a finger¬ís worth of off-white to a nice tan color that lasts for a good minute before dieing and leaving a super nice coating of tan lacing clinging very nicely to the glass.
The smell is an almost perfect aroma to any imperial stout anyone could ever want. It goes a little something like this: super nice oaky/woody vanilla, cherry, chocolate, molassess and licorice. There is a slight aftertaste and its kinda woody with a nice dose of lingering molasses and vanilla. The finish is quick, dry and sweet.
On the palate, it sat about a medium to heavy. I sure did sip this. This is one not to gulp. Sessionability - ha, no way, man, one and done. ABV is felt. The carbonation is smooth and good for the style and for me.

1032,"2014-04-19",4.2,"2010 vintage. Shared with EricTeusink. This bottle is from my very first RB trade. Been holding onto this bad boy, getting advice on when to pop. The result was an extremely mellowed out brew, that did show a hint of age, but it was not a detractor. Thick black pour with ample dark mocha head. The taste showed mellow bourbon that was nicely intergrated with the molasses, and the licorice was just barely a character. Dark fruits swirled with a heavy dose of dark chocolate. Decadent. I would advice on drinking now.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"

Moderate sediment in the bottle after 3 years rest.A somewhat more subtle aroma for the style, not to be confused with a weak aroma, it¬ís just not pouring forth with either heavy amounts of vinousness, nor sweet chocolate/malts. Rather, it¬ís lightly smokey, with soft vanilla creaminess and some ashy roast notes. With warming, some barrel tannins emerge and mix with the light alcohol and roast, producing a liquorous-like warmth and complexity and rendering the nose quite dry. Long, dry black pepper and sweet bourbon lasts quite well.Somewhat alcoholic and a bit sharp on the initial sip, with chocolatey malts and sweet vanilla notes softening it some. Not as tight a carbonation as I was imagining, leaving it a little bit watery on the end and providing for only a medium body relative to style. What it does do right is provide an ashen, chocolatey and bourbon-like flavor that is quite interesting, very unique. Hints of pruney vinousness on the finish, with touches of raw, grainy wood (alcohol and barrel tannins). As it warms, the flavors come together a bit better, though the sweet malts never integrate fully, leaving the beer a bit disjointed, especially due to the somewhat light mouthfeel.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

A two-finger brown head forms before collapsing to a film and leaves patches of lace in the process. More lace rings are deposited on the glass during the session. The aroma is as advertised, but deliciously so - roasted malt, unsweetened chocolate, molasses, oak, anise, coffee, and barrel notes of vanilla and bourbon. Taste opens up with roasted malt sweetness, molasses, coffee, anise, and vanilla. Some bitterness creeps through on the finish featuring oak, coffee grounds, a little citrus hop bite, keeping the surge of sweetness from washing out everything else.

1032,"2013-12-05",3.6,"Vintage 2012, Best after 01NOV13

From the bottle: ""brewed with black strap molasses, licorice, with cherry bark and vanilla added with 6% aged in oak bourbon barrels, 11% aged in oak barrels, and 11% aged in oak wine barrels""

Near black ale with a sheet of tan foam that creeps up the sides. Smells of oak, too much oak, smoke, some licorice, some molasses and a bit of hops (never had this experience in this beer previously). A resiny, bitter character on the nose. Flavor is alcohol, oak, bitter, licorice, toasted malts. I really, really want this to be better, but this is simply the worst iteration I¬íve had. Full bodied with moderate carb and a semi dry finish. I am concerned the prestigious heritage of this beer is faltering. While this is far from the best vintage, this is still a nice beer, and I¬ím happy to have a couple cases in the cellar, I probably wouldn¬ít have done that had I known about the deviation. 

Vintage 2011, Best by 04AUG12
4/4/4.5/4.5/4- 4.28 on 29NOV11
A: pours a dark, dark ale with nearly two fingers of really dark chocolate foam. This falls to a thick sheet of the same only dissipating once the beer sits for nearly an hour. Cobweb lace when foam present.
S: The bourbon barrel is present (surprising given the low percentage aged), some more oak, molasses, vanilla (subtle). The wood is quite strong when cold, as it warms the cocoa, coffee, molasses and bourbon come through much better.
T: The beer is roasted! Lots of toasty oats, oak, cocoa, bourbon, vanilla. Super refined tannins. Good bitterness to it. The vanilla is there alongside american oak. Black coffee and bittersweet chocolate. 
M: Burly body with lower carb. Nice, long, sticky finish with semi dry resonance.
O: This beer is good, but I don¬ít know how many I will be picking up this year for the cellar. I¬íve found through some recent tastings, that I may prefer this beer fresh. All the better! Makes me long for it in the off-season!

It came black as night with a slight head, but the lacing on the glass was huge and adhered to the glass until finished. Aroma of chocolate and molasses and licorice. Flavors similar, but this is where it was more interesting. At first, the roasted and dark chocolate flavors dominated, followed by a significant bitterness at the back of the tongue - not overpowering, just very nice but definitely there. Full flavors. Toward the end of the glass, the flavor profile seemed to be more sweet than at first, but still with the constant bitterness not quite in the background. Very very nice. Bourbon flavors were present but not overpowering. A well-balanced masterpiece of a beer. I?d sure like to find a bottle and bring it home to age for another year, but am happy to settle for a glass or two with a friend at the pub, seated in front of the fireplace. This was worth the drive, and I?ll do it again not too far in the future.Today (end of 2014), I enjoyed a glass of the 2011 Abyss.

1032,"2013-10-01",4.7,"I poured a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. It had a ""best after"" date of 11/15/2011 (one year from the bottling date?). It cost $15.99 ($0.73 per ounce).

Appearance: Absolutely pitch black body with a small dark brown, foamy/frothy head. It laces and retains well considering how heavy and old the beer is.

Smell: Sweet aroma of black licorice, vanilla, and cherry. 

Taste: I got this bottle of Deschutes The Abyss (2010 Reserve) in a trade with my friend Ryan in San Diego back in January of 2011. I cellared it immediately and planned on drinking it later that year, but for whatever reason I kept putting it off. Now, nearly three years after this beer was born, I finally decided to drink it and I¬ím kicking myself for having waited so long. It¬ís everything I look for in a barrel-aged imperial stout, but without any of the weightiness or edginess of a fresher vintage. 

There¬ís a lot going on in this beer, though that¬ís not surprising considering it¬ís brewed with licorice and molasses with 1/3rd of it aged in oak and bourbon barrels. Imperial stouts of this caliber tend to be rare and expensive but this one definitely deserves all the merit it receives. It begins with a luscious, sweet flavor of dark cherry. It¬ís almost tart in a way, like raspberry, but without any tartness. Some chocolate syrup flavors come through towards the middle, then changing to something more bitter on the backend. Big imperial stouts like this tend to be highly hopped for balance, but The Abyss is only 65 IBUs, giving it balance, but keeping the hops in check. There¬ís a delicious woody/vanilla flavor on the finish, which I like to let linger on the tongue to savor. The alcohol has mellowed nicely and has faded into the background and probably accounts for the vanilla and woody character. 

This beer is basically everything an imperial barrel-aged stout should be, and is one of, if not the best example of the style. 

Drinkability: While Deschutes The Abyss is a big beer at 11% ABV, with three years under its belt it¬ís aged remarkably. The alcohol has mellowed to the point that it¬ís just a subtle warming sensation in the background. The body itself is pretty full, though the mouthfeel is a little thinner and cleaner than I was expecting. It¬ís calm and soft and goes down smooth with no burning or warming sensation. It leave a lovely aftertaste of licorice and roasted malt, yet it¬ís not drying or cloying. I probably should¬íve saved this for a more special occasion than an ordinary Tuesday night.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Pours syrupy black with handsome tan head and good retention. Molasses, deeply roasted malt, smooth (and mild) bourbon, toffee. Smells great.  

Oily, viscous body delivers the delicious fast and furious. Some initial sweetness up front before coffee, bourbon, chocolate, and molasses take over. Touch of hops midway through too. Mildly bitter finish is reminiscent of baker's chocolate; booze kisses the back of my throat as it descends. Damn tasty.

1032,"2013-02-25",4.2,"22oz bottle split 2 ways. 2010 vintage properly cellared. 

A: Thick pour into a tulip yields a mocha head which recedes rather too fast. Color is true to the maw, but it¬ís the legs which impress. They leave a brown stain on the glass.

N: Peppercorn, molasses, anise, chocolate, roasted malt, coffee. Laden with an earthy bitterness still. Fudge goes deep as does the licorice. Has a slight raspberry and cherry edge. 

T: Lots of blackstrap molasses and black licorice. Substantial earthy hoppiness. Roasted coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Lots of black peppercorns. Raisins and prunes compose the back of the flavors. Oaks, as always is quite strong, though bourbon is not. Every sip is a bitter, sweet, and spicy assault on the tongue, but it¬ís never cloying or overpowering.

M: Heavy on the palate, but it does lack some of the heft of its competitors. Lots of alcohol still. This might have another couple of years until it peaks.

O: A fantastic RIS. Never goes too big in any one direction, which is a big positive in my book, because it¬ís easier to find the spectrum of flavors. You¬íll enjoy it, it¬ís a given. Pity this is the last year of the non-futzed version.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

I was honestly shocked that I didn¬ít like this more.  I¬íve been wanting to try this beer for a while, and expected a world class beer.  Maybe it was just a bad bottle or something, I don¬ít know, but I think this one will require a re-visit for sure...","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Pours a nice mocha head with tight bubbles.  Beer is pitch black, no light coming through whatsoever.  Head is dissipating rather quickly, but at 11% that is to be expected.  The nose on the beer is huge.  Notes of bittersweet chocolate, molasses, sligth dark fruit, slight coconut and vanilla notes.  Hint of alcohol but it is masked well by the vanilla.  The taste is tremendous...front of the tongue you get really bitter dark chocolate with a slap of molasses that moves through to a bourbon chocolate goodness.  Hints of vanilla come t hrough along with a toasted coconut. Definite leather in the finish. The barrel age blend that makes this beer lends so many flavors to it.  There is no hint onf the 11% ABV in the taste, but there is a warming in the belly.  This beer is fantastic and hestly the bottes say best after November 2013.

It keeps on going and going with a lots of tastes queing up to surprise your mouth. The body is full with a carbo that just fits perfectly.. There is some carbo, but it?s barely noticable.

A: Do I even need to write this? Jet black body with a fluffy, two finger dark khaki colored head that has great retention that leaves minimal lace and heavy brown legs.

S: Very rich in the nose, but delicious. Molasses and licorice are there for the sweet presence and it is brought down to earth by the dark fruits and chocolate. Very minimal oak hovers in the background.

T: Wonderful. The oak shines through more in the taste than the nose. Dark fruits, bitter baker¬ís chocolate and some cocoa nibs are all present. Subtle coffee flavors peek up every now and then. The partial barrel flavors are wonderfully integrated and sit in the background. The very subtle bourbon just gives this beer another layer of flavor that is great.

M: Icredibly smooth and cream with a nice heavy body. Just enough carbonation to play with the palate, but not completely destroy it. Delicious chocolates and subtle oak linger long after the drink is consumed.

1032,"2012-09-23",4.3,"2011 bottle poured from a bomber very generously sent to me from Errl, into a brandy snifter. Thank you for hunting this one down for me! Pours a dark, dense black, nearing purple with just a thin tan head of foam resting atop. The aroma is so rich and complex with notes of licorice, molasses, dark chocolate, coffee, oak, bourbon, cherries, wine...holy shit this has a lot going on. The taste is just a continuation of the onslaught of awesome that the aroma so nicely indicated it would be. It¬ís earthy, roasty, warming, just a little sweet and so damn good. I can easily see why this beer is rated so highly. It truly is world class.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"

1032,"2012-09-20",5.0,"2008 Vintage, served for the family on Christmas, one of the most memorable beers I¬íve had

A: This motor oil....Abyss pours pitch black with a dark brown, almost purple, color head. Retention is really good for the ABV, but not amazing for the style

S: Molasses, caramel, toffee, lactose, TONS of fruit (dates, figs, apples)...really impossible to summarize, and anything I say won¬ít do it justice.

T: Whoa...like double rainbow shit! So complex...sweet, charred, smokey, nutty, woody (oaky), fruity, just wow. Absolutely tons of molasses. If you are reading this review for a reference, do yourself a favor and post an ISO thread instead.

MF/D: Perfectly viscous, creamy, velvety, super smooth. Carbonation is spot on, finish is lactose/awesomeness.

Notes: Truly remarkable. I really enjoyed this beer, and looking forward to acquiring another. Not over-hyped in my mind, and if you think so, I¬íll give you my address so you can ship it to me

As far as complexity...this is comparable to KBS for sure, but they are just too different from each other to compare in terms of which is better.","Parkland, Florida, Florida, USA","scottyshades"

1032,"2012-08-15",4.5,"Pours a dense coal-black with a thin, wispy, mocha head on top. The nose is rich and sweet with plenty of vanilla, oak, chocolate, charred toast. Really nice. With a beer this big, I like a bit of depth in the feel. This one delivers. Heavy full-mouth with ample carbonation to back it up. Rich, velvety feel with an easy finish. There¬ís so much going on in this beer, it¬ís hard to stay focused. The vanilla makes a showing, but it is fleeting at best. The sweetness instead comes from the semi-sweet chocolate and toffee character. With such a small percentage of this seeing the bourbon barrels, I¬ím not surprised that that is downplayed as well. Mild spiciness on the back end, and a slight tart kick to finish this one out. Fantastic beer. One I was glad to trade for, and one I will hunt down again.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

The beer pours a dark brown opaque body with a tan head that dissipated quickly. The head clings to the side of the glass, just by the pour you can tell it¬ís a rich thick beer.

The nose is light, some chocolate and coffee, with notes of vanilla in the nose followed by a tad of oak and bourbon.

Amazing flavor, just out of this world good and surprisingly complex. Filled with chocolate and coffee, there¬ís a touch of vanilla, licorice, a nice subtle oak-iness that gives the sweetness depth. Incredibly well-balanced smooth imperial stout.

A very full-bodied beer, the Abyss boasts in it¬ís rich creamy mouthfeel, almost like silk it¬ís so smooth. When paired with the complex flavor profile it just makes this one of my all-time favorite beers to enjoy after some aging.","Denver, Colorado, USA","prosper0"

1032,"2012-06-26",3.9,"2010 Vintage. Stored at Cellar temp since release. Poured into a Tulip glass at cellar temp (59 Degrees). Allowed to breathe for 5 minutes before reviewing. 

A - Nice hiss while removing the cap. Poured a 2-Finger coffee & leather colored head. Head subsided to a quarter finger over 5 minutes and left behind a small film of bubbles. The beer was midnight black, semi-thick pour but not as oily as I expected. Decent head lacing, slight alcohol legs but nothing too intense. Expected for 11%

S - I can smell the beer from 2 feet away. Up close, I¬ím getting a big coffee with chocolate syrup scent. The licorice bombs out on the back of my nostrils leaving behind an intense milk chocolate sweetness. Hints of bourbon but nothing overpowering. 

T - Wow. Okay, I don¬ít quite know where to start. First taste is the bourbon followed by sweet vanilla and peppery licorice. I get this dry roasted almost biting chocolate espresso bean taste that fades away leaving behind an oaky chocolate sweetness that fades to a bitter oakiness over the course of about 30 seconds.

M - The mouthfeel is slick and surprisingly thin for an Imperial Stout. On  a very vigorous mouth swish, I only get about 30% carbonation mouth feel. Medium to heavy body and A super oaky sweet finish that reminds me a lot of cane syrup fresh from our farm.

O - This is a fantastic beer. The Imperial Stout category has seen a lot of changes in the last few years. Abyss holds its own against a lot of huge beers. Stoked to finally try this.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

T: Splendid, smooth BA stout. Bourbon and sweetness are subtle, and everything is balanced to perfection. The licorice adds a very interesting component to the overall flavor. There is a certain dryness in the finish. Slight alcohol detectable, more so in vintages that have not benefited from time in the cellar. Mouth-watering and delicious!

M: Great carbonation and balance. Smooth going down, this beer really coats your palate. What a joy to sip.

The aroma featured roasty caramel malt with notes of vanilla, molasses and brown sugar, and also had some earthy hops for balance.  It tasted sweet and malty with flavors of caramel and vanilla, but also had some roasty earthy bitterness mixed with a bit of licorice and a subtle cherry bite.

Rich smell of molasses, roasted malt and burnt wood.

The taste is a ride in the following order: malt, milk, burnt malt, alcohol heat, whiskey burn at the end. Amazing. Each taste blends with the next in a wonderful experience.

A crisper texture with a little cream to it. Almost no carbonation.

One of the most enjoyable of the imperial/barreled style that I have had. Great smell and taste without being a burden to drink.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"

1032,"2012-03-12",4.3,"Bottle 22 oz, trading. 2009 version. So, flip a coin: that¬ís the issue with year 2009. Infected or not? You should open it, no way. And... mmm, sweared against the entire creation and universe after uncapping. Acid and oxidation, so bad. But I thought hope wasn¬ít lost, so I stood still. Waiting. Waiting. Waiting. And after five minutes, wind turned. A MASSIVE roasted, burned malt and coffee notes rose, it was the beginning of the show. Plus wood, chocolate, cocoa, smoke, ashes, vanilla, butter, bourbon. Then the pouring: an espresso. Black as 1000 ft deep pit, creamy and almost yellow-beige foam. Spectacular. Body is full and thick, powerful but not annoying or like a brick in your stomach. It has the strengthness of malt, the sweetness of molasses. Both candy and burned sugar, bourbon again, red wine, SO MUCH coffee, caramel, oak. Overall is great, in particular the perfect clash among the bourbon elegance and the hardness of malt and oak. Between that, molasses and licorice doesn¬ít ruin the show. No boring, no boozy. Warms mouth. Finish is totally dominated by licorice, like chewing the classic candy wheels. So, another big IRS add to my notes. Verily, I had 2008 version and remember not so much (was after too many beers...); but I state that a younger version is better since - according to my memories, at least - bourbon vanishes after years; wasn¬ít so present. So, my suggestion is having with max 2 years aging.
A masterpiece, hard to have - better shared - but extremely pleasant.

1032,"2012-03-01",4.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 2/9/2011.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. 2010 version.

This pours somewhere between mahogany and black, with a ruby walnut corner in the middle. A creamy brown cap sits on top, fading to a few islands after a short while and leavin a few spots of lace.

Roasted malt, dark chocolate, anise, smooth mild coffee, and a bit of earthy hops. Great balance and depth in the aroma.

The roasted malt and espresso are the first two flavors to hit my palate. A little bit of dark chocolate integrates well with anise, vanilla, and oak. There are some earthy hops that blend well with the anise as well. The end of each sip warms the stomach. 

I felt like this got a bit syrupy, which is the only true detractor for me. It has a huge body, a great creaminess, but the light carbonation contributes to the syrupy feel for sure. There is some light residue that sits on the tongue afterward.

This reminds me of Stone¬ís IRS in how balanced it is. Not a coffee or chocolate bomb, Abyss simply presents a variety of enjoyable flavors to you, one after another, letting them integrate over time. A very relaxing sipper.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

1032,"2012-01-30",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 11, 2015 Thanks to Savvy for the bottle. 2011. Beer is dark black and appears thick. Carbonation is mild. Beer is completely opaque even at the corners. Forms a thick and aggressive dark brown head that falls away relatively quickly leaving a lot of lacing on the glass. The resultant head is thin and diffuse and eventually breaks. A visage of the original head hung out in the middle of the glass for the duration of the beer. The aroma is complex. There is a lot of sweetness, brightness, some alcohol, a lot of roast, malt and coffee, almost a syrup but not cloying aroma as well. There is a hint of anise in there as well. Beer is medium to full bodied. Late roast taste followed by a strong aftertaste of bitterness and roasted malt. Definitely some espresso character. I was expecting a little bit of bourbon but got none. I did however get some warmth from the alcohol in the front of the mouth along with considerable gravity and sweetness.

Aroma was so inviting. Chocolate, strong coffee, vanilla, so much going on, this was amazing. Taste is incredible. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, molasses, caramel...so many sweet flavors and yet they still have the powerful flavors of a regular imperial stout. Says it is best aged, and it does get better, but it¬ís also drinkable fresh. Mouthfeel goes down so easy, still very carbonated, but I can tell that this becomes better with age. Very viscous, and lingers well. This is incredibly drinkable. This is still easily in my top 3 of all time.

1032,"2011-11-17",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2015 Had a 2009 bottle previously I will give them a chance of redemption. 2010 bottle.

It pours a deep, rich black with a frothy, creamy dark brownish tan head that sparkles with bubbles and eventually leaves beautiful ringed lacing on the sides of my snifter. It sure looks great.
Had a 14 and 13 on draft recently, too much tartness, downgraded.
It has a thick-smelling molasses, caramel, and chocolate bonanza. There is some nice biscuity scent in there as well. The oak comes in slightly with oakiness and some vanilla. Roasted malts and coffee round out the scent profile. The one thing I¬ím missing in the scent is the advertised licorice. It surprisingly smells very similar to last year, minus the hint of sourness.

The flavor is very nice. This is a rich, robust stout with plenty of bitterness unlike some of the other big-name stouts. Lots of bitter cocoa, roasted malt, and coffee, it just comes in waves. The barrel aging doesn¬ít present itself as much in the flavor. There is some oak flavor but not an oaky smoothness. It is woody but in a way that accentuates the bitterness. It could be just because this stout is so much more bitter than its counterparts. Usually you see the oak melding with the sweetness creating a smooth, rich flavor. This one instead opts for a woodsy bitterness. I love it. Plenty of hops too. The sweetness is there though. It creeps up on you, most of it is chocolate. It isn¬ít too harsh with the alcohol, but you can feel it is a pungent brew. The things it lacks in the flavor though are bourbon and licorice, but maybe they just blend in so well that I don¬ít notice them.
 
This one stands tall in the imperial stout category. I think the reason people love it is it doesn¬ít get over the top with the sweetness.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

light sweetness and lightly bitter with a nice amount of booze, the finish is all bakers chocolate.

The beer pours an deep, rich, inky black color almost like motor oil.  It sure seems to have a similar viscosity.  No light penetrates this beer; it¬ís like a black hole.  A toasty, brownish head forms up like a film atop the beer and sticks with it all the way to the bottom, leaving a beautiful web of lacing.  Once I let it sit for about ten minutes in a footed tulip glass, the beer was giving off lush and deep aromas of bourbon, oak barrel, bitter cocoa, soy sauce and black coffee.  On the palate, the beer follows up and rounds out the nose with hints of molasses, dark fudge, light espresso, chocolate cake, oaky whiskey, anise, dark fruit and a burned, caramelized sugar taste like the brittle coating on a creme brulee: WOW.  The finish is luscious yet not cloying, with a delicious smokiness cradling some wood and mocha.  Overall, this beer is unfathomably complex and a real treat to drink.

Almost candy-like with caramel and molasses. The coffee notes came through  with cocoa and some vanilla. The flavor was so busy it¬ís hard to keep describing. Extremely rich with ultra long finish.

T - Lots of deep roasted flavors up front slowly giving way to hints of chocolate, coffee, and other dark, earthy, flavors. Finish is pretty hot from all the booze with a lingering roast.

Palate : Soft silky mouthfeel. Rather thick.

Overall : Wow, awesome stuff. I really like the big molasses notes along with the well balanced bourbon barrel notes. I really like the long and rich finish. Not too much alcohol, not too sweet.

poured into a Darkness goblet.

Appearance:
By the time the foam hit the edge of the glass, it was sitting around a finger and a half, a chocolatey light brown color. The beer itself is jet black, even if I put it between me and a window. The foam gradually cuts itself down into a light covering with thick lace.

Smell:
Sweet and licorice-y, with the molasses coming in loud and clear too. the oak/bourbon is fairly subtle but present. I could imagine someone mistaking the licorice and molasses for chocolate.

Taste:
Sweet, like a liquid molasses cookie. licorice in the background, slightly masked by oak flavor. Hints of bourbon and chocolate, with just a touch of coffee. There is a very very light hop bitterness, just enough to balance with the sweetness.

Mouthfeel:
Syrupy and thick. Chewy certainly comes to mind. Low carbonation, and very full body. Coats the mouth and doesn¬ít let go, forcing me to savor it forever.

Overall:
I think this may be my favorite sweet stout. It really is amazing. Everything about it screams deliciousness. Probably one of the best beers I¬íve ever had.

1032,"2011-09-21",5.0,"Oh how sweet that deep, dark Abyss (2010 Reserve) ¬Ö

For quite some time I have been reserving THE number one spot of my Beer Hall of Fame for THE best brew.  Deschutes Abyss is THE brew!  From the moment I peeled off the wax covering and removed the cap I knew that this would be a brew like none other.  Many friends and brew-aficionados had long been telling me that this was the brew of brews that were along my taste preferences.  What a fool I was to wait so long to partake in this enticing beverage!

After refrigerating for a few days and then into the freezer for an hour, I let this brew ¬ërest¬í for an hour to warm up a tad. This brew poured up a decadent near-black colored body sporting a healthy mocha-colored foamy head with retention like I¬íve never experienced (so much that I had a lot of foam left on that last sip!) and lacing that left you holding the glass and admiring the artwork long after that last sip was taken.  Amazing scents of warm cocoa, roasted malts, alcohol (not too much), and slow roasted robust coffee.  This coffee is complex and tantalizing with flavors of dark chocolates, coffee, roasted hazelnuts and hints of vanilla and well-aged bourbon that beckons you to take another sip just as soon as you finished taking one!  The body of this brew is just astounding with the just-right thickness and that smooth, clean finish with a warm, bitter, chocolaty, light bourbon aftertaste.  Delicious.

I enjoyed this beverage all by itself and it¬ís definitely a warmer-upper!!  At 11% ABV (alcohol by volume) this bad boy does the job right!  So it is definitely NOT a brew to be quaffed!  Slow down, relax, and enjoy.  While this brew is recommend to be enjoyed during the wintry months, it is definitely one that can be enjoyed all year round.  When the next reserve is produced, I know I will be stocking up and cellaring many, many bottles of this fine beverage.  Heck, I might even share a bottle; might, that is!

Pairing Recommendations: Enjoy it by itself or pair this brew up with a hearty slow-grilled porterhouse steak or some wild game (venison, buffalo, feral hog, etc.) or even some slow-smoked brats/sausage.

1032,"2011-09-20",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2011 2009 bottle, from trade. Jet black body, big creamy caramel head. Very, very nice. Aroma is leather, licorice, wood and hints of tar; surprisingly low on the usual coffee/roasty/dark chocolate tones that are so common in the aroma of imperial stouts. Taste is licorice, leather, coffee (more here than the nose), smooth roasty malts and hints of grassy hops way in the back. Some coffee liqueur tones and milk chocolate in the aftertaste. Palate is wonderful; creamy and full; just the way a beer like this should be. Very nice and rock solid, but nevertheless not quite as awesome as the rating indicates.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

1032,"2011-09-05",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2015 Aroma:  Initially some grassy hop, bitter coffee and bitter chocolate plus licorice.  After it warmed a bit:  the licorice came forward then coffee and bitter chocolate followed.  
Flavor:  Bitter, grassy hop initially, then bitter coffee and smooth dark chocolate liquor with bitter coffee, hop and chocolate on a 1 minute plus finish.
After it warmed:  Licorice dominated with coffee and bitter chocolate and it finished with chocolate transitioning into coffee, bitter hop and mocha.
Comments:  Extremely rich and filling.  Dinner and dessert in a glass.  Good even at room temperature.

1032,"2011-09-04",4.9,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Snifter.

Appearance: Almost pitch black with strong initial head that dissipates but leaves lots of bubbly lacing.

Aroma: Massive amounts of molasses and licorice. Nice layers of oak mustiness, coffee and light citrus.

Taste: Oh my God, this is unbelievable. The sweet molasses and licorice complement the harsher roasted qualities of coffee, char and dark chocolate. The partial oak aging imparts an extra Bourbon-like layer, as does the slightly bitter and citrusy hop finish.

Palate: Extremely smooth with low carbonation and a thick full body. Nice dry and warming finish.

Overall: Simply fantastic. Maybe the best Imperial Stout I have ever had. Now I need to find another bottle to cellar.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

At first taste got heavy notes of roasted malts and tobacco, as the beer warmed it slowly changed into more chocolate and coffee notes, clearly can taste the oak from the barrel aging. Overall, great beer, better enjoyed room temperature than cold, and an interesting note, could not taste the licorice nearly as much as i expected, which in my opinion, is a good thing.","California, USA","danbierman"

Nose picks up coffee, dried fruit, oak, liquorice.  When tasting I also get some vanilla, chocolate and toasted oak, and liquorice that kind of sneeks up on you and lingers for a long time. Big flavours, rich mouthfeel, a bit of warming alcohol towards the end. I¬¥ve had the 2008 and 2009 (infected) vintage before, I would rank the 2010 vintage higher than both of those.

Strong, smoky aroma has tones of molasses, wood, bourbon, licorice and semi-sweet chocolate. It pours midnight-black with a thick and rather persistent fine-bubbled tan head that leaves substantial lacing. Flavor is beyond delicious - rich and smoky with tones of molasses, licorice, toffee, caramel, quality coffee, nuts and chocolate. It seems as though each sip is a little different. Thick, smooth flavor has a firm fizz that leaves a persistent tingle to go along with a smoky, nutty, mocha finish. This beer is worth a drive all the way to Oregon!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"

Pours a nice deep black with a thin head that lingers awhile leaving just a bit of lacing. It has a nice roasty smell with chocolate, coffee, molasses, bourbon, licorice. The taste was excellent. It followed the nose and showed exceptional balance. Just the right amounts of bourbon, molasses, and licorice to go with the roasted malts. This beer shows why it is so highly rated. It was thick and smooth with light carbonation. This was a lovely stout and I did drink it slowly, but it certainly wasn¬ít a chore to drink.

1032,"2011-05-19",4.7,"Vintage 2008:  Pours pitch-black with a dark brown head.  Looks ridiculously viscous, almost like that black slime monster from Creepshow 2.  The aroma twists around your sinus cavity, daring you to name all its components;  there¬ís a defined oak-barrel base, but also with a coffee liqueur sweetness that fades into Raisinettes and grain alcohol.  But, God, how this brew is tasty.  Beyond tasty, in fact, a near-perfect Imperial Stout tweaked to godlike status.  There¬ís a bitter undertone, a hop-current, that provides the circulatory system for the beer, but the competing drool-inducing flavors all allow the IBUs to pass by unmolested.  Why worry about hops when there¬ís bourbon, oak, coffee, chocolate, dried fruit, and molasses all engaging in a gladiatorial death match upon your taste buds?

A bit thin on the palate for an imperial stout, but with nice, soft carbonation.  Flavor is sweet, roasted malt, chocolate, coffee, a bit of oak and bourbon.

1032,"2011-03-31",4.2,"2009 Vintage, poured into a tulip. Beer is dark black and appears thick. Carbonation is mild. Beer is completely opaque even at the corners. Forms a thick and aggressive dark brown head that falls away relatively quickly leaving a lot of lacing on the glass. The resultant head is thin and diffuse and eventually breaks. A visage of the original head hung out in the middle of the glass for the duration of the beer.

The aroma is complex. There is a lot of sweetness, brightness, some alcohol, a lot of roast, malt and coffee, almost a syrup but not cloying aroma as well. There is a hint of anise in there as well.

Beer is medium to full bodied. Late roast taste followed by a strong aftertaste of bitterness and roasted malt. Definitely some espresso character. I was expecting a little bit of bourbon but got none. I did however get some warmth from the alcohol in the front of the mouth along with considerable gravity and sweetness. Overall its a good beer. Its not my favorite imperial stout but it is really good. Drinkability is good and mouthfeel is good too. I would be interested to see how this beer changes over time.

The sweetness from the molasses comes through afterwards and in the finish. The 11% abv isn¬ít very upfront. It lies dormant within the brew to provide a slightly warming as it goes down.

The aroma is very strong. As I write the review I start to get whiffs of yuminess from about 2 feet away. I really like this smell because unlike most stouts its biggest note isn¬ít coffee. The coffee is there but very subtle so it allows other things to come to the front. I get a lot of sweet cherry, vanilla, bourbon, a smidge of alcohol and a little oak. A very nice combination all the way around. 

The taste is a little of a let down from the aroma because its not as complex, balanced or as sweet as the aroma. Don¬ít get me wrong it is very good, just a little below the high expectations of the aroma. The main taste is coffee from start to finish with a little bitterness, and alcohol at the end. There is also a little vanilla and oak.

Heavy hand of roasted and toasted malt, though not overwhelming. Anise and vanilla are modest but noteworthy. Tart black-currants meld into a small but wild fruity ester. Creamy malt undertone, middle to end, with a slight warming alcohol in tow. Suggestions of burnt toffee and mocha come to mind. Small push towards a long, lingering finish.
The sheer ""depth"" of The Abyss is more than remarkable. This beer is a good example of American brewers coming into their own and bringing it to the table.

Some earthy hops add some balancing bitterness on the back end. The flavor follows and is based mostly in rich dark chocolate, cocoa powder, and roasted espresso. Licorice and molasses add to the flavor profile while subtle bourbon and vanilla laden oak add further depth and smoothness. The dark chocolate and roasted espresso reign in this beer though.

Pours jet black with the typical tan head one would expect from an IS. The head lingers and slowly falls leaving behind a wake of beautiful lacing.
Roasty, chocolatey, sweet, coffee. Don¬ít get any of the licorice, but there is a slight bit of the molasses coming through. A bit of the oak, but mostly malt and the roasted aromas. Very complex bit of aromas fighting for you nose¬ís attention.
All the flavors show themselves in the taste. A little bit of the licorice is there, but it is easily masked by all the other flavors present. A little bit of a sour bite. Not getting any of the bourbon, just the woodiness. All the flavors meld together very well in this beer. I wouldn¬ít have imagined such an array of ingredients would make such a smooth tasting brew. But they did.
Viscous. And a bit bitter. Not as sweet as I imagined so your lips stay cleaner than most other RIS since you don¬ít have sugar caking up on your mouth. Not too hot either, weird considering the ABV.

It pours black with a half inch of of tan head that seemed to stick around for days... It looked fantastic in my stone IRS tulip. I couldn¬ít wait to dive in to this glass of motor oil.

The smell was as good as a stout gets. Oak, chocolate malts, vanilla, molasses, bourbon round off the initial whiff. The smells brown sugar and chocolate/vanilla stick around the longest. Love it!

The taste is amazing all the smells shine through in the taste, the sweet yet awesomely bitter taste keeps me going back for more. The first third of the bottle has lots of oak and chocolate malts with a ton of sweet molasses on the finish. The bourbon flavor is a bit subdued and I¬ím sure that¬ís bc it is only 33% aged in barrels. The beer is a bit rough on the edges and all I can think is how good it will be in 1,2 or even 3 years from now if I can wait that long to revisit it (have 2 more bottles). 

Overall it is a fantastic beer to drink now even though it is a bit young. I feel this could be one of my favorite beers if it ages to the potential I think it has.

1032,"2011-01-19",4.6,"2009 vintage. Poured into a snifter. Big thanks to kbutler1 for this one. Due to the recent infection scare, I¬íve decided to do my own investigative reporting. Here are my results:

4.5 A: A suspicious syruppy black enters my snifter. Two fingers of medium brown, frothy/creamy hybrid head stares me down for a slightly better than average amount of time. Indeed, the last quarter inch beckons me to attempt a sniff. Tormented lacing covers all angles of the glass.

5.0 S: Half expecting lactobacillus to bring forth pain and destruction, I lean over my glass. Instead, I am greeted with a lovely bouquet of amiable aromas. Sweet chocolate is most apparent with vanilla oakiness and molasses tying for the silver. The next wave brings a subdued bourbon and brewer¬ís licorice.

5.0 T: The taste is as magical as the nose. Bourbon and licorice step forward from their stealth positions take command. Vanilla and molasses are second. Oakiness, a mild bitterness, and roasted barley play their roles as well. Alcohol is apparent, but not overly so.

4.5 M: Lighter heavy body. Good moderate carbonation. Creamy and smooth with a moderate warming aftertaste.

4.5 D: The barleywines and RISs of my cellar rejoice. Their comrad has not been subdued by illness, but rather by Emporer DavoleBomb, who chuckles with delight as another great brew has done his bidding. Lots of great stuff going on with this one. I dare say this is better than the 08. One day an epic vertical will decide the true victor.

Dark, deep black beer with a dark brown head.  Lasting lace.  Tons of lace.  Like ice, with each sip the lace builds upon itself.  Beautiful looking beer. 

Big and complex.  Rich but mellow roast flavors.  Exceptionally well done.  Dominated by dark roast flavors but with no bitter or burnt flavor.  A bit of earthy tones, even berries, and a malt sweetness with hints of caramel/chocolate sweetness comes through as it warms.

2007 vintage. Pours pitch black and almost completely opaque with only faint mahogany edges when held to a light source and a two finger frothy mocha head. Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that coats the glass with chinks of soapy lacing.

Slightly smokey, roasted malt aroma with lots of luscious, silky chocolate as well as some licorice, subtle oak, vanilla, coffee bean, toast and toffee.

Chewy medium body with an incredibly luscious, silky chocolate malt flavor. Hints of mocha, toast, oatmeal, mocha and toffee as well as some caramel and sweet alcohol. Slightly creamy presence mid-palate makes this beer incredibly smooth and extremely quaffable. Slight bitterness up front is countered by the chocolate malt as well as the oak, bourbon and vanilla notes. The ABV is excellently masked making it dangerously drinkable. Also, the barrel aging adds to the complexity and balance of the beer and instead of it being a complete bourbon bomb it results in an incredibly complex, flavorful and well balanced, amazing beer.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

1032,"2011-01-07",4.7,"O jeez what a beer.  2010 release.  I didn¬ít bother with aging it, too impatient.  Pours out tar black, cannot see through any of it.  Medium-ish yet lasting head with lots of lacing, with a color not unlike dark chocolate milk.  Aroma is incredibly enticing, sweet, and complex.  I¬ím getting strong notes of artisan dark chocolate, bourbon-oak, and clean coffee grounds, with lighter notes of vanilla extract, molasses, with maybe a touch of roasted caramel.  Diving into the taste is a remarkable experience.  First of all, the alcohol is very hidden.  Tastes about 7-8%.  I¬íve had 9%ers that burned more than this.  This is very smooth both in alcohol and in texture.  Texture is somewhat oily with very, very little carbonation.  It¬ís barely prickly, but it¬ís an interesting mouthfeel, yet it fits superbly with the flavor profile.  Flavor has a lot of roasted chocolate, some wood, light notes of burnt caramel, lots of roasted malt, and a surprising cappuccino note, interesting only because no coffee was used as an ingredient.  Also getting flavor notes of molasses and a hint of black licorice.  The finish is noticeably hoppy, but is hidden behind an overwhelming sweet and malty body.  It¬ís probably as hopped as a common IPA, but good grief its so underscored.  But not in a bad way.  This should make the Top 5 of any Stout lover.  It¬ís delightfully chocolatey, smooth, too complex to describe it with words, and as bold as a radio talk show host.  Save this one for special occasions, as it is a bit tough to drink without sharing, and I cannot see myself getting another one till next years release.

1032,"2010-12-29",4.3,"Notes from 10/2008. Received in my first trade. 2007 vintage.

Black. Fantastic lacing, really, no exaggeration. A dark almond colored head. Very nice.

Metallic until it warms. Dark chocolate reigns, with molasses, licorice, and coffee bringing up the mid-to-rear. Flavor profile resembles some of the other imperial stouts I have had, but there is something wonderful about the chocolate. The texture? Its particular bitterness? Wonderful fudge, followed by a light bourbon from the oak barrels, and a sweet but dry finish. I also pick up minor vanilla. Heavy roastiness.

Mouthfeel, as I¬íve alluded to, is wonderful. Medium to full, but there is a creaminess and particular stickiness I have not experienced before The Abyss. 

Perhaps I¬ím just having a wonderful day, but this is a great conclusion. And what¬ís more apt than The Abyss for the one and only VP debate for 2008? - a very drinkable and lovable RIS.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

A-pours an insane black that when help up to the light changes nothing. Never seen a beer this dark and the name fits. I very thick head in the shade of mocha with a rocky top is taking a while to melt. impressive do to the abv. The heal melts very slowly and leaves think sheets of bubbly lace.

T-I cant express how much excitement built in writing the previous parts to this review and on the first taste I am AMAZED. I have had a number of highly ranked souts and the flavor of this only beets them by a small amount. But the best thing is that the balance is perfect.

1032,"2010-09-24",4.0,"2009 Reserve, with a ""best after"" date of 11/1/2010. 650 mL bottle from AJ¬ís Fine Foods in Tucson, served in a snifter. Pours dark, opaque black with a tall frothy dark tan head. The head has good retention and coats the glass with lace. On the nose, there are aromas of oak, licorice, coffee, earth, whisky, berries and molasses. The flavour is surprisingly dry, with a moderate hop bitterness throughout. Notes of berries, coffee and charcoal lead to a deep, intensely roasted finish with strong hopping. On the palate, this is full in body with an alcoholic texture and soft carbonation. On the whole, this is a beautiful imperial stout. It is drier than many others and presents huge roasted notes along with molasses and whisky. It is also well hopped, and the final impression is of a very well balanced brew. It is incredibly complex; easily one of the best imperial stouts out there. I understand that many bottles of the 2009 vintage were infected with wild yeast, but there was no sign of that in this bottle. An amazing experience. I wish I had a few more bottles to keep in the cellar. 2010-09-24","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"

Nose is really profound with the coffee/molasses notes, loads of acidity here, but not infected acidity (I smelled enough of that), just a bright, clean, coffeish acidity. Flavour is very dry and ashy, a total departure from the Cigar City/Dark Lord/Surly Darkness school of super-sweet Impy Stouts, this one is wonderfully, refreshingly dry, more like Expedition. Flavours of coffee, chocolate, molasses, heavy on the molasses, plus roast, very dry and clean finish.

Appearance: Double wax covered bomber poured into a pint glass. Sexy black color with crushed red velvet corners. An oily sheen glazes over a brown mocha crown with mahogany highlights. Nice! Fair amount of head retention, quite rocky, some lacing.

Smell: black licorice, a small coffee tinge, molasses, and a touch of alcohol melded into a smooth yet complex nose. A touch faded with the year of cellaring on it so I¬ím giving it a 4.0 instead of a 4.5

Taste: Still some bourbon zing up front after the year of aging. Its a shame that the bourbon zing has an astringent quality. A nutty bridge comes next and then it finishes with a a bitterness normally associated with coffee. I might have caught this one at a transition period because the flavors seem to lack the strength and boldness of a fresh bottle, yet they fail to be completely fused as I was hoping for.

Mouthfeel: Lots of carbonation help this high ABV full bodied Imperial Stout. A touch thick but not to the point where I¬íd use the word syrupy. Very nicely done.

Drinkability: The mouthfeel really helps boost the drinkability of this 11% brew.

1032,"2010-04-26",4.6,"¬í08 vintage. Shared w/dad as our beer to ring in the new year.

A- Body is a solid dark brown/nearly black hue with a slight tint of auburn to it. Pours with an approximately 1 finger foamy dark tan head that quickly subsides to a thin collar. Small traces of lacing are left in the glass. When held up to the light the hue does not change and no light passes through.

S- Magnificent. This truly has the perfect aroma for an imperial stout. Upon opening the bottle a sweet aroma came through of sweet molasses, vanilla, and mocha. These are the dominant aspects of the nose but there is also a hint of roasted malt. Not even a hint of phenols can be detected.

T- The flavor is mildly sweet and complex upfront. Vanilla and molasses are the dominant flavors upfront but oak and roasted dark malt flavors provide a very substantial backbone to mellow out the sweetness. The finish is sweeter with a rush of molasses caramel and vanilla which are quickly doused by a big roasted malt bitterness. Everything subsides and balances out in the end- Roasted malt is the highlight but vanilla, molasses, oak, and a mild alcohol heat are also present.

P- Medium carbonation and a medium to heavyweight an ever smooth body.

O- This is a wonderful stout and one of the best that I have had. I see why it is ranked among the best. The best thing about it is the balanced character it portrays in the flavor...one of my new favorite imperial stouts...and I will be trading for it again.

1032,"2010-03-29",4.6,"2008 vintage. Pours a deep black with an intimidating head. It looks like a thick dark, dark roast coffee brewed superhumanly strong. It¬ís an intimidating pour but looks quite appropriate in the snifter. Great aroma. At first, it¬ís thickly smoky, but this gives way to vast complexity. It¬ís sweet with fiery alcohol and earthy with the subtlety of oak. The taste has a lot of strong notes that are all battling it out. They¬íre all quite good and I certainly enjoy the beer very much, but everything is not yet quite melded. There¬ís strong alcohol, strong bourbon, strong smoke, strong wood, strong malt, good bitterness and good sweetness, but the battle almost burns the mouth.  This burn is a bit of a problem on the palate and the carbonation is a tad sharp but maybe just in relation to the flavor. It¬ís not so much that the carbonation is strong, but that it burns the flavor in a bit uncomfortably.  Will improve with age.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

1032,"2010-01-17",4.5,"Tasted from a bomber from the 2008 Reserve.

This beer pours BLACK and it is completely opaque.  The head is spotty and brown with a red tint.  The first aromas that come to mind are molasses and cereal.  Other aromas include carob, black licorice, and toasted oak with a little bit of an alcohol burn.   To put things quite simply, this beer tastes almost exactly like it smells.  The addition is the black espresso flavor on the back of the palate and the finish.  The beer is extremely full bodied and oily.  The carbonation is still very alive, but has a creamy texture.  The finish lasts forever with a bitter coffee flavor.  Overall, this beer is awesome!  Exactly what I hope for in a huge stout.
****************************************** Tasting on the Same Night, here are the notes on the 2009 Reserve.  I know it says best after November of 2010, but I wanted to taste these two side by side.

Appearance (5/5) - Pretty much the same as the 2008.
Aroma (7/10) - Completely different...smells almost like a cola, considerably sweeter.  Chocolate malt, fertile soil, and a brown sugar sweetness.
Taste (6/10) - This is really bitter...maybe overly so.  Over-ripe plum, black pepper, carob.  Bitter, bitter, bitter.
Palate (4/5) - Full bodied, not as oily, much fizzier carbonation.  The finish still goes on forever.
Overall (15/20) - This is too young.  The note on the side of the bottle should be heeded.  That adds up to a total score of 3.7.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
1032,"2010-01-10",4.0,"2007 bottle thanks to CaptainCougar.   Pitch black with a medium-small tan head.   Sweet aroma with intense malt, caramel, burnt sugars, and roasted malt.   Seems a little mellow, but at a couple years old, this was to be expected.   The flavor is dryer than I expected with a roasty bite in the finish.   Overall though, quite smooth with just a little more angular roast and a hint of alcohol towards the end.   Rich all the way through with a light lingering sweetness.   A touch of wood mostly adds to the dry feeling that I get, but bourbon is not at all evident, which I sort of like, but also doesn¬ít seem to be adding anything positive.   Medium-full in body with medium-low carbonation.   Pretty nice stout, but not the most intense, good or bad.   Mellow after a couple years, but still hanging on.

1032,"2010-01-08",4.8,"Poured from 22oz bottle to snifter.

A: Pours a dark brown body that is basically black. Large brown head with great retention and interesting lacing after each sip. Almost perfect looking beer, but could have used a bit more lacing.

S: Strong roasted malts with a molasses sweetness tied in with licorice. Strong notes of alcohol and chocolate. This is a very strong scented beer, the king that you can pick up across a room.

T: Sweet and roasted malts upfront turn into licorice and molasses sweetness with some hop undertones. The finish turns into a strong bittersweet chocolate with a small hint of coffee laced with bold oak and a nice dash of bourbon. What impressed me most about this RIS is that all the flavors I love about the style made themselves very present. For the alcohol content I was surprised that more didn¬ít come out. This was absolutely amazing in flavor, completely lived up to the hype, it was perfect to me.

M: The mouthfeel was just as impressive as the taste or smell. Not too thick but still full bodied. Just the right amount of carbonation, small bubbles grace the tongue just enough to help pull out the complexity of this stout.

D: Wow, for how big of a beer this is it¬ís very drinkable. Usually with big stouts, I find it very hard to take down a bomber. This beer is easily drinkable by the bomber for one person, much more than I can say for anything else I¬íve had of the style.

Pitch black (and I really mean pitch black) with a very big, brown head that leaves plenty of lacings.

A very pleasant, fine-tuned and balanced smell. Lots of roasted malts, some licorice and notes of dark fruits and chocolate. As the beer warms up, the bourbon notes get a little more prominent.

The taste is really good and showcases a good balance between lots of different flavors. There¬ís lots of things going on here, but its still manages to come out as clean and easy on the palate. Plenty of sweet and roasted malts. Notes of wood and some charcoal. Some vanilla, molasses, burnt sugar and dark fruits. Even tough the beer is sweet, it¬ís not as sweet as I had expected and definitely not cloying. The bourbon makes a subtle appearance every now and then. The finish is great with a pleasant bitterness to it and some warming alcohol, but most importantly a rather powerful and lingering taste of licorice that seems to lie as a separate layer of its own, detached from the the rest of the flavors in the finish.

Big body with a slightly sticky, but still smooth, texture. Carbonation is good.

A very good imperial stout. Well balanced and actually quite easy to drink. The contributions from the licorice in this one are a work of art.

Flavor is chalked full of roasted barley, creamy chocolate, espresso, fennel, molasses, wood, burnt caramelized dark sugars, and a foreboding ashen malt profile.

This one pours a nice, deep, black. Just like it should be, with a name like The Abyss. Medium hard pour produces a two-finger head of dark cappucino colored foam. Retention is great and the lacing is excellent. Fully formed, solid and very sticky.

Nice. Big dark roasted barley maltiness. The oak comes through nicely, mixing with a hint of alcohol, giving a hint of bourbon-like qualities. Nice hint of dark molasses. Good dark coffee notes blend with hints of dark chocolate, bringing me back to cappucino comparisons. Light vanilla notes.

Huge presence of dark roasted malts. Big dark coffee profile. Nice vanilla sweetness, along with molasses, bringing balance. Nice presence of oak. A light touch of smokiness. Very mild notes of dark fruitiness. Hops are in there, but extremely well balanced with the rich maltiness.
Man, this tastes wonderful.

This is exceptionally smooth and creamy. Like silk across your pallette. The low level of carbonation sereves this brew very well.

Despite how big, thick and rich this one is, it is very drinkable. The beautiful level of balance make this one so enjoyable and easy to consume. The 11%ABV is so well blended into the mix, as to be hardly noticable. Just a slight warming effect.
This is exceptional.

Pours a pitch black motor oil pour, thick and dark, with a big dark brown head, laces well, sticks around, brooding overall with a sense of something special in store. Aromas are a decent dose of bourbon, vanilla and alcohol, wet oak and a light spirit sweetness, licorice and caramel, roasted malts died back a bit, with coffee, chocolate, definitely less sweet than it¬ís counterpart (Black Butte XX). Sweet, deep, dark. Initial is full bodied, but not chewy, a thick roast grows on the palate with bourbon and a bit of heat on the front end. Backend displays more powerful growing roast, coffee, a touch of chocolate, and anise. Coats well, sweetness not as much as expected as lighter bitterness and bourbon, roast, and a good coating remain on the palate from the thickness. Powerful and brooding, just a bit thinned out by the barrels (likely because they only aged a portion). Bitterness grows surprisingly strong towards the back end, heat dances a little more, vanilla is lighter as roast and coffee take over strong, as a bit of ashy smoke, burnt malts take over as we get further into the glass. This beer is big, powerful, but not overly thick and the sweetness is really surprisingly less than anticipated. Overall, black licorice loses my favor.. but that is simply because of my opinion of that flavor. A very nice brew that surprised me overall. Good, very good!

Chocolate is the most noticeable aroma. A nice roast aroma as well. Very nuanced in terms of aroma. Rich beer. Flavor is nice. Lovely wood roast flavor. Some sublte chocolate and coffee to go along with this. The wood and chocolate develop and get to be more rich and deep as you let the flavors develop in your mouth. Alcohol is well hidden.

1032,"2009-07-09",4.4,"Original review date 3/12/2009...shared with a few fine folks from the industry and accomplices...into Sam Smith half-pint glasses...

Mildly viscous...definitely opaque. Licorice, spent motor oil, whatever ya wanna call it...this shit is fuckin¬í wicked DAAAHHHK...

I picked up some Vermont maple candy here off the top...makes sense from the label regarding molasses. A little licorice is in there too. Hops provide some raw green wood here-not pine, not grass...maybe something deeper...huge, copius malt has a good bourbon quotient but not obtrusive.

This has a little less sweetness than, say, Dark Lord (2008) but has a fortuitous heft...a little boozy heat, lots of XXX-roasted malt with a dry caramel sweetness, and a slightly austere hop package that resonates well with the licorice, charcoal and bourbon-snifter oak quality.

Although this has dry bites to it from the licorice, hop profile and a bit of booze, it gives off a great creaminess on the finish. A little more all over the place...may need some time.

Top notch and won¬ít pass it up. Sure, it¬ís a little young but there¬ís a lot of craziness in this one. It¬ís got an edge like a street gang, no doubt. But it¬ís profound as hell and the creaminess is like the soothing tone of a mother settling her little hooligans down. One of the great ones.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

Aroma is strong floral hops with a rich chocolate and coffee blend, quite gritty and full, nostril coating, touch of creaminess, oats maybe?  I had an 08 about 6 months ago and the hops were way out of balance, seems to be doing better now.  Deschutes always has distinctive flavors and this is no different, first taste is quite ashy, off-dry, some dark berry tartness adds some acidity, charcoal and hard roasted coffee, typical Deschutes floralness tends to integrate well with this beer and the age, maybe some oat creaminess, a bit oily with a hint of salt like an old ale, this is probably the peak time for this beer.  Long coffee and chocolate shortbread cookie aftertaste, still a bit dry and ashy but with enough residual sweetness to compensate.  I¬ím sure the licorice plays a large part in counterbalancing the tobacco flavors which are ever present.   Body is great, fluffy, oily, large but playful carbonation, full bodied but not a chore, quite creamy with just enough viscosity to make you know this beer is huge.

1032,"2009-05-09",4.1,"Oak was involved so expect much biased praise and lavished love.


Black gold fills my glass, scaring away all semblances of light and virtue while massive clumps of lace adorn my glass and her peak. Like a mist clinging to her cragged peak, wisp of licorice and vanilla bean cloud my sense while a faint lemon zest clears the way for more aromatic pleasures. Soft wood cushions more vanilla, caramelized crunchy sugars, raisins, and delicate tobacco notes. This is definitely one instance where having my head in the clouds is a compliment. My first quaff is clean with a surprising bite of tart spiciness that was nowhere evident in her nose. An almost dry herbal effect lingers on top of my tongue, tasting of nutmeg and cinnamon. Sweet crunchy molasses mingles with her spice for a dry finish. Filling my breath and seeping into my pores, smoke and tobacco permeates a lingering warmth and earthiness to The Abyss 2008 Reserve. Any coffee and chocolate notes are mild and subdued, choosing instead to take a backseat as the oak, smoke, tobacco and dry spices take center stage with a delicate sweet finish. Finesse; not usually a word one would associate with an imperial stout, but such is the case with this grand representation. Bravo.


All oak-loving biasness aside, this truly was an excellent imperial stout from Deschutes Brewery. Initially she was not what I was expecting, but turned into far more than I could have hoped for.

A: Peel back the wax and pop the cap. It pours deep dark and thick. This one is darker than the richest cup of espresso. A thunderous milky cocoa head bolts from the bottle and dies down to a nice thin layer across the top. Lacing, yeah there¬ís lacing. This beer begs to be drunk.

S: So nice and complex. Big bold chocolate comes right at you as soon as you crack the bottle. Once poured into the glass other aromas really come bounding forward. Fresh roasted dark coffee and licorice come out as well. Hints of vanilla and hazelnuts hide beneath a dash of brown sugar. Man I have never smelled brownie batter so nice.

T: I love a good RIS and this one is at least two levels above good. I was hooked by the aromas, but the taste really hammers in what a quality brew this is.

Huge aroma- I could smell it as I popped the cap off- of molasses, dark chocolate, espresso, black licorice, oak, and- like every one else- some anise. Taste up front reminds me a lot of the DR Baltic Porter. Super powerful roasted and chocolate malt with milk chocolate and vanilla ice cream. Almost no warming alcohol. Finish is really where this beer shines. Rather than tasting like the end of a whiskey shot like other imperials, this beer finishes sweet and quick reminiscent of cappuccino gelato. Just a beautiful thing to savor in every way. 3/28/2009 8/5/8/5/16=4.2651mL 2010 ed. The pour is a near black with a healthy, menacing, Martian red head towering up with slow trepidation. Mean, sticky lacing abounds with layers and explosions of harden lava and obsidian. Aroma is already impending something quite special: big vanilla bean ice cream, beautiful vanilla and subtle notes that scream bourbon though bourbon barrel is not a dominant character here. Fresh hazelnut coffee, meaty flank steak, fatty/savory/umami characters take hold in an intoxicating whirlwind. Warm pecan pie, candied street food pecans, and slight spicy alcohol form the crescendo. Almost the superlative nose for imperial stout. Taste upfront makes it very obvious this is not an underattenuated milkshake. There is fatty steak and umami character quickly usurped by dry wood, tannins, big licorice, and big oily then dry spicy dark chocolate. Dry, almost soapy palate with obvious bitterness. The ends adds some fresh lemon and sharp tartness.

Similar to the Black Butte XX, this was 33% barrel aged, and in both cases, I wished it was 50% at least.

This was a 2006 bottle I have been sitting on for almost a year and I figured it was time to drink up and give it a half-assed review. This was the second time I had this beer and all I remember from the first ingestion was that it was good. This too was pretty damned good. Black color, small tan head, and smells like licorice and chocolate. The taste is more licorice, chocolate, excellent. The alcohol is non-existent until the beer is gone and then it sneaks up, good thing I didn¬ít drink the whole bottle. The mouthfeel is sticky and slightly thick but not quite as thick as Dark Lord. Good job Deschutes.

-2007 bottle-02/23/2008

green, meaning green apples (acetylaldehyde?) and odd, licorice taste and as it warmed a nice choco-ashen flavor, syrupy, too expensive. I preferred the 2006 to this so I will let my remaining bottles cellar...

-2007 vintage 11/03/08

Smells like a nice hefty, roasty RIS with a good dose of alcohol and a touch of malted milk balls. The taste is bitter, like old and cold coffee, gritty and grainy. As it warms up it gets better but seems to have a tough edge to it.

2008 Vintage.
Pitch black, head of chocolate milk steamed foam with slightest ruby tinge. Floral vanilla perfume, subtle roast lingers in nostrils, mild alcohol awaits.  Taste of herbal sweetness (fennel, clove, anise, and licorice also) at first, followed by smooth, rich, bitter chocolate, roasted cappuccino, cascadey/centennially hop taste/bitterness accompanying; lingering finish of bourbon and sweet vanilla.  Remarkable in its smoothness, like resinous, vinous, refined oil.  A finely viscous extraction.
The Abyss is an oak-aged imperial stout that is sweet with bourbon (from the barrel) and floral vanilla (from the french oak), a sweetness that suggests milk chocolate after an initial impression of dark chocolate-covered herbal candy.  Complex, warming, and indulgent.  Higher percentage of aging in the oak bourbon barrels might improve overall impression.","Chandler, Arizona, USA","festivale"

A wall of burnt malt hits you on the first sip in both smell and taste.  Then the ABV shows its ugly head.  The aroma has an amazing burnt toast smell to it.  The head is dark tan.  You can get some tobacco and nut flavors out of it.  But then there is the flaw, the alcohol presence.  Its there, big time, the whole time.  The alcohol taste, presence, and dominance is similar to cheap high ABV malt liquor like 211, and anytime you compare a beer to 211, its not a good thing.  The dark tar molasses syrup has a huge amount of potential, and maybe if you hid it away for a few years you might have something, but fresh, I did not enjoy drinking it.","USA","Nik925"

There is really so much here that I don¬ít have the words to describe it, but my mouth, my tongue, my throat, esophagus, and stomach all know what they¬íre experiencing.  As soon as I popped the top of this, an unworldly aroma filled the immediate vicinity with a bouquet of licorice, anise, coffee, and heaven and hell itself. The body of this is the thickest I¬íve seen thus far. I could go on further, but let¬ís just suffice it to say that my dear Old Rasputin has been dethroned and thus the perfect 5 I gave it will have to be adjusted, as this is the new One. The alcohol burn on this is perfect, both in effect and sensation; Like when Obama said, ""I know it¬ís cold outside but I¬ím fucked up."" Thanks Deschutes.

Probably the most intense brew out there that isn¬ít very sweet. Okay, it¬ís a little sweet, but that¬ís not the whole of its sheer heaviness, unlike some other big imys. Huge roasted malt, huge hops to balance, and deep dark fruit and licorice as promised to send this one to that elite level.

Creamy, dense caramel-colored head, and the creaminess carries over into the first sip right through the last. The flavor is a perfect blend of all the qualities you want in an imperial stout, though most that try to blend these come up a little off.  Smokey chocolate, raisins, molasses, a faint though unmistakable vinous undercurrent, and some boozy oak. Just sweet enough up front, just dry enough on the finish, with a slight, pleasant alcohol burn. Reminiscent of Leinenkugel¬ís Big Eddy RIS, though more intense, and with a better, dryer finish.

Lacing on the glass is smooth and silky -First sip was licorice, chocolate, sweet yet with a bite, with an aftertaste of pure heaven.  2nd sip was same but I noticed some fruit.  Palate is perfect with a lot of carbonation and thick oily feel.  Thanks to BIGBANG for this brew!  This is the best of all the beers that I have tried all rolled into one.  WOW.  No flavor is too overpowering- as soon as I feel the licorice is a bit much I get a nice coffee undertone, or cherry, or bourbon, or carmel, or molasses.   There is so much packed into this beer.

Pours a thick, disgustingly delicious blackness that can only be compared to a black hole. Nice 1.5"" mocha colored head that fades slowly with a lot of sticking left behind :) Molasses but not DL molasses. I don‚Äôt know much about the stuff but this is different than that. Fudgey with a nice whiskey nose [from the barrel]. Prunes or some other dark fruit is present and bringing in the rear of aromas. Thick, rich and nasty (in a good way). This is one bad Larry! The thickness has an eruption of chocolate, molasses and whiskey oak. A very good and slightly bitter combo! Feels nice and heavy but goes down so smooth you can‚Äôt tell your about to be attacked by some serious flavors. A must pick up and try! Have one, have two. This is one damn damn great beer.

1032,"2008-08-20",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2008 Bottle and tap ratings averaged.Bottle. Aroma starts off with a strong coffee character before developing into a blend of coffee, chocolate, molasses, and complex notes from the subtle bourbon aging that seem to come and go, sometimes with more bourbon, sometimes with more wood, sometimes with more alcohol sweetness. Flavor is big with the same notes, and I continued to be impressed with the subtle yet tantalizing bourbon component. Bitterness arrives cumulatively in the form of hops, bitter coffee, and intensely roasted malt as the glass goes down, building on the tongue and in the back of the mouth, balancing out all the sweetness in a businesslike but necessary manner. Huge creamy mouthfeel. Great beer. 8-5-8-4-16/4.1On tap at the third release 11/08. I didn‚Äôt take notes, but looking over my first rating, it sounds pretty accurate. However, the incredible balance of bitter coffee (especially at the finish) with the rich, chocolaty malt and sweet subtleties contributed by the bourbon really stood out to me in this super fresh form.

I was worried that if I sniffed it, it would sniff me back but damn it, I had a job to do, so I took the chance. Boy, was it worth it. This is a symphony of molasses, oak, pistachio and coffee grounds. [The Abyss‚Äôs rating of Highlandlad refers to ""a stench of haggis, socks and cheap aftershave"" and rates him 1/10 for ‚ÄôAroma‚Äô - but he refuses to hold that against it.] In the mouth, this was thick and creamy - just the way I like heavy stouts. It‚Äôs a layer cake of bitter chocolate, marshmallow, coffee milk-shake syrup and turpentine with a rasping, astringent finish like the strongest espresso your Italian barrista can deliver.

1032,"2008-07-28",4.2,"THE DAN JOURNAL #200!  Tasted 7/28/08.  22oz bomber.  Pitch brown with a Clinging, lacing beige head.  Big nose.  Notes of smokey bacon, coffee, anise, chocolate and cocoa.  Touch vanilla woody aroma.  Full bodied and big.  Complex malts and noticeable alcohol presence.  Sweet and bitter and tart.  Big notes.  Sweet dark fruity undertones.  Big coffee acidity.  Bitterness shines from the warming alcohol and the rather deep hop profile.  Definitely pick up on the peppery, spicy anise, licorice taste.  The molassis seems more reduced and crystalized.  But it does mellow out some of the sharp edges.  This is hugely complex beer with a depth to match!

Flavor on the 06 is roasty with cocoa and dark chocolate and a ton of oak.  07 is less oaky with a better integration of wood, chocolate, licorice, and brown sugar. Nice feel all the way around.  07 already wins here and seems to have much more potential.  06 seems over-oaked and one dimensional, while the 07 needs a bit more time and I think it will be really great.

But thes pours like an impy stout and has a sweet molasses finish.  Roasted coffee flavors are involved with this subtle and complex brew.  Plays on different parts of your palate nicely.  At first you get a prune, cocoa, chocolate aroma.  The palate is first cocoa which leads to roasted coffee and a sweetness that reminds you of molasses and finishes sweet as well.

1032,"2008-06-12",4.2,"One of the highlights of the BIF Race 2007 Sinister package from Eyedrinkale, The Abyss (2007 Reserve) came in a 22 oz. bomber with neck dipped in black wax. Luckily it was the pretty soft and came off without much struggle to allow me to get to the real attraction. The beer poured out absolutely black in color as expected, and holy crap did it have a dark head. The color of the head was like chocolate syrup at first, and as it died down to foam, it revered back to khaki. The smell was roasted coffee, but it did not seem overdone. The roasted aroma was mild enough to allow some light hops to poke through. The much anticipated first sip was quite dry and the astringency made my cheeks pucker. As I adjusted to the graininess, chocolate, toffee, malted milk balls, vanilla beans, oak shavings, and black coffee made themselves known. This was a big, bruising, hefty stout, and needed to be approached with the respect it deserved. Not very easily approachable, unless you already know you want something like it.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

I¬ím not weak but this beer is assuredly stronger than my will can withstand (OK, I¬ím weak).

1032,"2008-05-26",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2009 My Bottom Line:
Roasting molasses, dark chocolate and licorice harmoniously converge onto resinous bittering hops for a lush Imperial Stout replete with flavor and knowledge.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam stands atop the darkest black.
-This is a lot more cohesive than the Stone Bourbon Barrel Russian Imperial Stout which we had right before.
-Roasted malts accompany the resinous hops in the finish and their combined bitterness succeeds in cutting through the malty sweetness.
-A well-levelled anise-y spiciness comes from the licorice and fits perfectly with the grain bill.
-The body is pleasantly full, not obese.
-There is some alcohol warmth in the back, but it does not bother at all.
-The barrel-aging job is subtle and is very efficient in the flavor profile.

Thick mouthfeel with a really nice long bitter (although it fades as it warms) and chocolate finish. A really, really nice imperial stout. Old rating: 7/4/9/5/18Eight years later, and this seems pretty different. Really hot, and lots of anise and notes of Big Red chewing gum. Not great. Taste is also hot, with roasted malt and anise again. Pretty sweet and not much hop bitterness. Not a whole lot different than the aroma except the roasted malt is much more prominent. Great mouthfeel; thick and smooth and a long finish. A solid beer, but this pales in comparison to the great imperial stouts such as Expedition.

Pours a pure opaque black with a drak brown rim and a fine, medium-thin chocolate brown head.  Aroma of dark chocolate, coffee, a slight lactic character, sweet roasted malt, treacle, a hint of dark spice, and a subtle suggestion of anise, hops, a bourbon barrel--that‚Äôs just the aroma.  On to the flavor...  Bitter coffee, bitter chocolate, sweet molasses, and roasted malt that rises and then fades over a backdrop of subtle spice, licorice, and wonderful oxidized characteristics.  A very deft hand with the malt balance here.  Each element is well represented in a way that is complimentary to one another.  Each flavor peaks at a different moment so that none is overpowered and each can be discerned both individually  and together as a whole.  The body is exquisitely balanced with the 11% alcohol present only in the structure and not in the aroma, flavor, or finish as any hashness.  Only a slight warmth accompanies the roasted bitter finish.  Everything is superbly integrated.  This is one of the most balanced ""extreme"" beers I‚Äôve ever tasted.

Nice espresso aroma¬ís with a bit of bittersweet chocolate dancing up from the cup.  Sticky but balanced with a good dose of bitterness from the hops, specialty malt, coffee, molasses and licorice.  Tasted with darklord soon after and I thought this was more complex, but lacked the body of darklord.  Very well crafted with many layers of complexity.  Oak and bourbon come out on the backend.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"

Initial smell is of dark chocolate and roasted malts with a hint of molasses. Smelled just the slightest bit of alcohol, though mild and pleasant.  Wow is this a wonderfully complex beer. Slight initial bitterness gives way to a roasted chocolate malt taste with hints of nuts and coffee. Slight bitterness returns for a smooth aftertaste.

Some bitter hops come out near the end in the nosr and the palate. I think a few more months in the cask would have brought out the bourbon flavors . A very nice beer that beckens you at every sip.

Seems that it needs some time to truly express itself. Lots of potential. Thick but a bit dry. Easy drinking for the style, other than all the alcohol presence.

1032,"2008-04-12",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 28, 2008 This is by far the biggest, richest and darkest beer I¬íve ever tasted. As a good friend of mine put it, it made a Stone Imperial Russian Stout we had afterward taste like Budweiser. It pours like motor oil. Black. Not dark brown, black... with just a bit of a coffee-colored head that doesn¬ít stick around long. Initial aroma of yeasty chocolate, coffee, brown sugar, soy sauce and molasses - and it opens up beautifully as it warms. The first thing you notice on the first taste is the mouthfeel - it¬ís so thick and viscous that it¬ís syrupy, and coats your mouth beautifully with initial flavors of dark-roasted coffee, molasses and licorice, with just a hint of oak from the barrels. Sweet at first, but it leaves a dry, bitter aftertaste that lingers forever in your mouth. The alcohol is hidden completely. I¬ím still not a huge fan of stouts, but this is by far the best I¬íve had - it¬ís a trip.

RE-RATE 11.28.08. 2008 bottle. I managed to get my hands on a few bottles of this year‚Äôs release, and I have to bump up my score for this brew a few notches. I‚Äôve developed a taste for stouts, and this one might just take the cake. 100% opaque, even around the edges. Great chocolate head. The flavors are as I described last year (above), with a bit of bourbon, too... but what strikes me is how incredibly smooth this brew manages to be for how huge it is. It does for Imp. stouts what Pliny does for Imp. IPAs. Just utterly fantastic.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

1032,"2008-04-09",4.4,"Now THIS is a top 50 imperial stout which actually lives up to they hype. The description (1/3rd oak-aged, molasses, licorice) makes it sound like a bit of a dog¬ís breakfast, but this is decidedly subtle. To the extent that such a huge beer can be subtle at least. No piney American hops or weird bourbon character here, the dominant character is immense, rich, espresso-like maltiness. Not so much the high-end roasty notes, more the middle-ground toasty, walnutty elements of a really good, concentrated long black. It tastes like brown malt to me, but who knows. British hop pellets in the aroma, with some hay and perhaps licorice (not sure of the power of suggestion element here). Just so intense and rich and concentrated, without any weirdness. Massively rich, smooth mouthfeel too. Has a real element of class about it that most American (and other) imperial stouts lack. Top darts.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

Aroma of vanilla, light smoke and huge black chocolate notes is pretty intense but well balance as well. Taste is a sublime mix between some black chocolate, some light smoke, molasses, some oak and bourbon. This is a very well balance mix with no flavour taking over and completely overshadowing the rest of the flavours. Body is full with engine oil consistency but with a creamy texture as well and good carbonation and no apparent alcohol.

Hops are in there and bring out that wood flavor, but not assertive.  Bitterness is moderate and balances well.  Very toasty too.  There is a bit of salty soy sauce that creeps in at times that isn¬ít exactly great, but it stays mostly hidden.  Gets even softer as it warms.  There is a slight touch of bourbon, but it¬ís really just a nuance of the mild sweetness and assertive wood, not its own flavor.  Bourbon does come out more as it warms as well.  Alcohol can be tasted a bit on the breath, but just slightly.  Complexity and the unique huge toasty oak flavor are the big strengths.  Lots of points for not being just another imperial stout.

Very prominent molasses notes in the nose, and some of the sharpness of the licorice too (which comes through more in the flavor). I sticky, resinous body that¬ís just the ticket (wish it head slightly more vibrancy to it, but that¬ís not a big knock). This year¬ís young Abyss, however, is a bit less complex than less year¬ís. There are some nice malts, some earthy grain, and a shit-ton of roasted coffee dimensions, the latter of which tends to overwrite many of the other qualities. Still a very nice drink, but the oaking isn¬ít really coming through much at all and the roasts are a bit too face-wrecking at this point. Rates highly, but I¬íll have to give this a while (or tuck into my remaining 2006 bottle).","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

1032,"2008-03-14",4.1,"clean tasting and a good blend with the right weight to the barrel flavors. tends toward cleaner flavors (away from fat fruit flavors) and the anise and molasses do a great job of rounding out the malt sugars and providing depth. piutch black, some of the darkest foam I¬íve seen in a while. even warming it doesn¬ít expand much flavorwise  alth9ough some earthiness emerges.

1032,"2008-03-14",4.3,"Big thanks to Old Mr. Crow for sending an ¬í06 and ¬í07.  This rating is for the ¬í06 version.  The pour is jet black with 2-fingers of dark brown head, a minor Guinness cascade, and sticky lacing.  The nose is big; dark malt, chocoff, blackstrap moiasses, mild nuts, some earthy peaty bourbon notes.  The palate is rich, hefty, with a flavor profile that reminds me of a slightly heftier and more complex Gonzo.  The roasty dark malt taste is there, with a lot of molasses, dark choc, coffee, and a solid, noticeable hop bill.  It gets a tiny bit hot as it warms, and the palate heft isn¬ít as massive as some Impy stouts I¬íve had, but I have no problem with all the acclaim this beer has received.  It is very good.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

1032,"2008-03-11",4.0,"2007 bottle. Nicely balanced, if not overly complex, imperial stout. Very drinkable. Opaque body with a deep tan head. It clings to the side of the glass like motor oil. The aroma is not as strong as I thought it would be, but there are notes of burnt malts, licorice, cherry, coffee and chocolate ¬ó and a hint of fresh-cut oak. The flavor is moderately sweet and moderately to heavily bitter in the finish. Full body with a velvety texture. Moderate carbonation. Not as complex as Dark Lord and not as intense as Expedition, but a solid and thoroughly enjoyable imperial stout. Thanks Randy.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
1032,"2008-03-10",3.8,"2007 edition - many thanks people! Huge creamy head, choco-mousse lookalike, fed by small but insistent pearling from black beer, and leaving textbook rings of dirty lace. Molasses, dry cacao powder, some ureum, used sportsshirts, and faraway wood, as well as spruce needle aromas. Very roasted, burnt flavours: grain, coffee, and in the end, burnt hops. Retronasal false liquorice sweetness, if just a hint, and some black chocolate. After some time, one starts to recognise some hops, greenery-like. Very slight astringency. Very creamy & rich-velvety texture, full-bodied being an euphemism. Alcohol very well hidden. What was all the fuzz about? It¬ís well crafted and reasonably complex, but then again, at 11% ABV that is not exactly a miracle.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

This was nicely done, but a little dissapointing.","Holt, Michigan, USA","masonjer"

1032,"2008-03-09",4.4,"Bottle from Windy City Liquor. I was so very relieved after I got my hands on this bottle since I had been hearing about it for couple of months now. The aroma is a delighting smell of dark chocolate malts with a very tiny hint of cream or milk. The appearance is a pitch black stout rested in peace with a firm layer of head. The flavor is a strong and bold tasting of roasted malt but yet has a minor taste of chocolate still. The palate is rich and creamy which leaves behind an excellent finish along with a moderate dryness. This should have been distributed more than it was.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"
1032,"2008-03-09",4.2,"Bomber, big shout out to Tronraner, the man responsible for putting this in my possession. Pouring this stuff is comical. It¬ís almost like a parody of imperial stouts, it is ridiculously thick and pitch black. Lacing on the goblet is like a wall and the head, though tiny, is brown. The aroma wasn¬ít all that great at first, but this beer was way too cold. I got strong sweet, cola scents at first, but when this neared the appropriate serving temperature that disappeared and was replaced by pleasing espresso, cacao, earth, an ashy nuttiness, and molasses. It¬ís a wonder what temperature can do. But as complex and pleasing as the nose is on Abyss, it isn¬ít strongly aromatic. The flavor is a different story altogether. It wallops my palate with dense espresso and a very drying bittersweetness. I was actually concerned this would be too sweet, given the addition of molasses, licorice, and the barrel aging, but it is not to sweet at all. Any sugary character is deep and is always countered by a heavy roasted or dry quality.  Wow. This is seriously good. A few more sips and my palate is quite pleased. An almost milky quality is noticed along with hints at hickory. God, this stuff is thick.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Unfortunately my ratings and most of my memory fell into The Abyss. I remember the black rich liquid, the brown head, the intoxicating effect of the beer. The silk tar sliding across my palate.

1032,"2008-03-09",4.4,"Bottle from The Wine Smith in Placerville.  This brew had excellent control on the palate, despite having complex flavors of chocolate, licorice, and molasses as a thick stout.  There was also great balance on the amount of carbination and control of the ~87 BTU.  It poured deep, used engine oil color with very limited head.  I¬íll buy this again in a second.

1032,"2008-03-05",5.0,"2007: I bought this off of bockyhorseThis is a very robust version of this style. Pouring next to black and thick as jerry curl. It throws off a decent head and reduces slowly leaving behind a nice spattered canopy. Strong aromas of heavily roasted malts and a very distinct nutty waffer which gives it a nice unique quality. Full nectar with good carbonation producing an almost creamy texture.  I already feel a Trump coming on. First off this brew lacks the Bourbon essenceI¬ím looking for. It¬ís mightily roasted shoving charcoal down my throat like a starved locomotive. Only mildly sweet with a defined hop component to help balance this monstrocity. It¬ís quite complex with heavy doses of leather, iodine, cocoa, barn blanket, copper kettle. The finish is long and bittered well. The high abv is undetected. Another classic to make it¬ís way to AZ. Overall: It¬ís a classic but I am dissapointed about the lack of Bourbon flavor. I¬íll have to Trump this one.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"
1032,"2008-03-05",5.0,"Poured into my trusty snifter. I can¬ít think of anything to which to compare the blackness here that hasn¬ít been used a thousand times already (ink, midnight, motor oil), so suffice it to say this beer is really really black. The head is a devilishly dark tan that forms slowly through the viscosity, peaking at 2 fingers¬í height. It gradually shrivels back down to a hazy cap, leaving spotted lacing along the way.

Aroma is deceptively sweet, a siren¬ís song that tempts you to indulge yourself. Powdery cocoa and milk chocolate tickle the nose, with faint notes of licorice.

There¬ís a lot to be said for the chocolate/coffee flavor dynamic of the RIS world, and there are lots of beers that manage greatness confined within that dynamic. But The Abyss is so much more. The chocolate emerges early on the palate and joins forces with the bittersweet bite of molasses. The licorice is fleeting but apparent, as the beer fades into a sublime roastiness. It¬ís never too sweet and never too roasty. You¬íd never know that this beer is 11% abv but for the pleasant warmth in your chest. 

The body is thick and luxurious, but this beer still finishes dry. Carbonation is spot-on for the style and facilitates the velvety smoothness.

Drinkability is immense for such a high gravity beer. The balance and synergy of the flavors make for a phenomenal brew. This beer deserves its hype and its rating.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

Appearance: Pours a black body with a small, fizzy, short-lived dark tan head.

Smell: Aroma of dark roasted malts with notes of licorice, molasses, and a shot of alcohol. A good measure of oak in there without overdoing it, which is always nice to see.

Taste: Flavor loaded with roasted dark maltiness. Plenty of dark chocolate syrup, toasted marshmallows, and spicy anise. Relatively mild sweetness throughout. A taste of coffee that grows exponentially as it warms. Reasonable oaky presence. A strong, earthy bitterness helps balance the heavy malt. Tiny hints of bourbon. Chewy, earthy finish.

Aromas of black cherry, red licorice, pineapple, and alcohol, bolstered underneath by lots of roast venison, chocolate, and vanilla; very earthy, spicy, and savory.  Balanced amicably between chunky malts, vibrant hops and barrel accents.  Bitten slightly with soapy espresso grounds.  Flavor is soft and pensive at first, giving only milk chocolate, lactose, pine, and citrus dishsoap.  In the mid palate lots of roasty, rich tobacco and acrid coffee bitterness alternate pleasant and painful punches of meatiness, though the tropical hops evident in the aroma never really concede the sugary acidity they provide.  Blackberry, cocoa nib and port wine with bourbony licks of vanilla, oak, and nougat rush in after that hint of synthetic bitterness.  Very creamy in the mouth, with soft carbonation; full and rich, but never imposing.  Hints of pear, burnt meats, and lots of vinousness with full roasted mocha java in the end.  Finishes fruity, juicy and bloody.

100th rating; Bottle courtesy of the clumsy golubj; thanks alot dickhead.  Poured a dark black, about as black as possible  Aroma of roasted meat, roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and caramel.  Pretty complex beer.  Oak, bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, caramel, molasses, and hops.  Almost too assertive in the flavor.   Definitely a beer to sip, as mention in the profile.

What a long day of boozin it had been - don¬ít forget the quazz too.  Appearance was larger spotty bubbles and a loose knit carbonation.  Aroma and flavor were similar - dark chocolate wrapped with smoke, charred and roasty marshmallow, and a hint of sweet creamy vanilla.  Finishes long, slightly bitter, deadly drinkable.  Leaves a delicate film all over the mouth and gums - just outstanding.  Only knock is picking up a slight bit of a astrigent salt here and there - but it didn¬ít ruin or deter my fascination with its excellence.  Just a great stout all-around.

Faint hints of brewer¬ís licorice as well. Very smoky flavor with rich chocolate truffle and espresso, with a subtle oak barrel character. Hickory wood and a light soy sauce presence are detectable.

2007 Bottling

I was lucky enough to get this in a recent trade, a big thanks goes out to you Bill. Abyss gurgles from the bottle and appears as a black mass in my snifter. The tan head grew to one finger as I poured and left some quality drink lines after ech sip. The head eventually falls to a skimming with a thick ring surrounding the body. A good looking stout for sure.

The aroma doesn¬ít have as much of the noticeable barrel aging as I expected. As this beer warms the aroma gets better and better. I left this one sitting out of the fridge for probably 40 minutes before opening and still the aroma just keeps getting better. Each time I bury my nose in the glass I find myself ihaling healthy doses of roasted grains, freshly ground coffee, and molasses in order from most aggressive to least. Hints of anise, oak, and spicy alcohol make ghost like appearances here and there along with a solid pine hop presence toward the back.

Flavor follows in stride with the aroma. If you want to read about the flavor profile take a look at the paragraph above. Everything is smooth and balanced for such big flavors. I¬ím not sure of the IBUs but they¬íre in a good place considering they¬íre not only balancing out the malts but also making a show of themselves. There¬ís a solid roasty bitterness on the swallow to create a good finish.

Body is full without a doubt. Starts off moderately full and as it works it¬ís way through becomes creamy and coating. Sluggish carbonation keeps this one working at it¬ís own pace and lets each flavor work on the tastebuds.

This beer sips along smoothly for an 11% monster but after I kill off this bomber it¬ís going to be bedtime. 

This is a beer to sip throughout the night. Another excellent Imperial Stout. The barrel aging was done very nicely for this beer. The barrel compliments instead of takes over like what happens with so many other barrel aged beers.

It looks amazing in a goblet. Rich and dark dark brown with a chocolatey head. 

The flavors are so complex, my feable vocabulary cannot begin to describe them. Typical stout flavors (chocolate, coffee) enhanced by the oak aging.

1032,"2008-02-04",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2013 2006, sampled multiple times, fresh to 3 months old.  The nose is decent enough, with a mild mocha, licorice and dry roasted coffee scent, but flavor-wise it¬ís not such a stellar beer as it¬ís been made out.  This actually tastes like a bad bottle of Rogue Imperial Stout, with the dry, ashy, hot alcohol and wood pretty much ruining any positives in this beer.  The bakers chocolate malt and bitter coffee qualities take a while for me to warm up to, and the hops I really don¬ít enjoy.  Any stout this large should not need hops like this.  This is not a beer that knocks my socks off the second I taste it, in fact it took me a good twenty minutes in order to write down anything complimentary.  But after some time I¬ím actually digging it.  The finish at first was a major turn-off; being so parched and dry like licking an oak plank - that¬ís not something I enjoy.  The molasses is barely noticeable, so light that without having been told that it tastes like molasses and licorice I doubt I would pick it up.  All I can really say about this beer is that the palate is a complete mess.  I love Deschutes, but this is not one of their better efforts.   7/4/7/2/14 = 3.4


2007 fresh bottle.  The nose is much less ashy and roasty, and much more chocolatey and sweet.   Has a distinct chocolate syrup flavor, and the dryness is still quite high, but it¬ís not so ashy, bitter or coarse.  Much better than 2006, but perhaps my tastes have changed.  I gave the 2006 some serious attention, two entire bottles, but didn¬ít like it.  The 2007 is absolutely killer. 8/4/9/5/17 = 4.3","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

1032,"2008-02-03",4.0,"Bomber, 2007 reserve.  Pours very dark, thick looking black with a nice, medium sized compact foamy head that is dark brown.  Head has good retention but slowly recedes to a thin film on the top.  First impressions of aroma are: chalkiness, dark fruits, some hops ¬ñ I think, light char, just the faintest scent of bourbon ¬ñ though that could be placebo.  At colder temperatures the aroma reminds me of Old Rasputin.  As the beer warms a more salty, smoky aroma comes out that is nice and reminds me of Mikkeller¬ís Black Hole.  Flavor is very rich with intense chocolate and some coffee components.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, maybe even a bit thin, for my liking at least. Finish is very dry. This is a quality Imperial Stout, no doubt, but it really doesn¬ít stand out among its competitors in my mind.  We¬íll see how some age affects this one.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"
1032,"2008-02-02",3.3,"UPDATED: DEC 20, 2011 22 ounce bottle.  Late 2007 version.  Leathery, ethanolic aroma initially.  Kind of salty, too.  I get some roasted choco malts and pine needles, but the aroma on this is pretty underwhelming to say the least.  It is a gorgeous, opaque, black body with a large, brown, rocky, head that has plenty of stamina and lacing.  Truly beautiful.  Inky, oily mouthfeel to start, which becomes quite roasted, burnt, and coffee-like.  A little chocolate and a little anise is also present.  The oak aging just doesn¬ít really make much of a presence in this beer.  It does finish quite dry and bitter with some pine/grapefruit hops melded with some ethanolic booziness.  Still kind of hot.

The aroma on this is very woody with tons of oak (not french oak).  There¬ís a light ashiness as well as mild roastiness.  Some coffee and anise is barely detectable.  Pours an opaque black body with a rather medium dissipating medium brown head.  Wish there was better retention.  Starts a little fruity in a way, like there might be some acidic cherries present, before this becomes super roasted and burnt in the middle.  Unsweetened chocolate follows, and then there is some woody and ashy character.  Not much on the anise.  Warming, long, bitter finish.

1032,"2008-02-01",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2014 Bottle shared by footbalm. Pours a deep dark brown with a similarly brownish head. The aroma is really great; deep moss covered earth, smoke, coffee, and some sweet molasses. The taste is top notch, really complex and yet so damn smooth. As with many great beers this changes a ton with warming; first, a bitter chocolate flavor with dark fruits, vanilla, brown sugar, and smoke. Later with warming the fruit and roasted malts come to fore, so damn good. A bourbon taste for sure, along with a really great creamy body. The ABV is strong at first, then nonexistent. Wow! All it was hyped to be.  Re-rate: at the 2010 Imperial Stout tasting Sam crack open the vertical, 2006-2009! 2006 was sublime, dark fruit, oily and powerful. 2007 might have stolen the show, just amazing; rich fruits, plums and figs, oily can nastiness that I love. My faith in the Abyss is 100%. 2008 and 09 are great, but waiting to peak. I had a whole fresh 2009 recently and didn¬ít dig it as much, but after trying all vintages I know this beer is among the best, and it cellars great. Thanks a ton Sam! 2010 vintage from the Utah State Store on 3300S. Rich, huge dry cocoa, dark fruit, bourbon, woody. Awesome. 2011: rich bitter chocolate and hops. Very fruity and dry, more barrel noticed than usual. Heavy bitter chocolate. Not much of the oil and dark fruit that I love. It¬ís too fresh. 
Re-rate: had a 2010-2013 vertical at Belmont. The 2010 was the highlight, light oxidation way smoother and more dark fruit and ash. The newer versions were more muddled with anise, vanilla, spices and licorice especially. All were good. The 2013 was the worst. 2012 was better than 2011 and 2013.

Bottle courtesy of after4ever.  Pour is all black with great settling and a gorgeous dark tan head. Beautiful beer. Aroma of roasted malts, earthy tobacco and some sweetness - honey, perhaps, but really sticky honey.

Taste is big coffee roastiness initially, transitioning to some licorice, finishing in a crisp bright hoppiness.  Some heat in the finish.  Despite the young age, and apparent heat in the finish this is a very refined and well put together beer.  the flavors swirled nicely as this warmed, and had a really deep complexity.

Pours black as night with a short lived nice tan head.  Smells like chocolate cake, graham crackers, fresh baked chocolate cookies, and unique for an imperial stout, also with a hint of molasses.  Taste is drying cocoa, roastiness, light cigar like tobacco-y flavors and char.  Simply fantastic.  Body is creamy but slightly drying at the same time.  Perfect light to medium carbonation and the 11% is completely hidden to me.  This easily lives up to the hype and is an amazing beer.  Wow...

On rerate I don¬ít get the Graham cracker smell at all that I loved, on tap in this 2012 vintage in 2014 , or the complexity I loved from the 08 bottles I bought tons of.  It still is good but it was missing a lot of the ashy, licorice, graham and cigar like nuances that made it so unique and one of my all time favorites.

The flavor is strong overpowering black licorice at first with a little oak and sweet chocolate malts leading to a charred bitter finish.  The alcohol is well hidden.  The mouthfeel is medium to full with low carbonation.  

Overall, I tend not to like the black licorice flavors, and this one has it strong.  As it warms (or as I get used to it), the sweetness starts to balance it out.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"

The mouthfeel was full, smooth and creamy, big malt presence at work here, this is damn near a beer that you can chew.

It could never live up to the hype, to being sold out everywhere, to the one or three beer limits. But it doesn¬ít matter. Aligned with that hype is the creamy, dark, roasty taste of this stout.

1032,"2008-01-20",4.5,"22 ounce bottle. The Abyss poured raisin black, with the faintest aura of ruby red.  The head was a frothy dark brown that left behind spectacular lacing.  The aroma was complex.  A slight woody scent was accompanied by thick molasses, dark chocolate, raisin, plum, licorice, and berries.

The first sip was the taste equivalent of a mostly charred log in a campfire that has started to cool down.  This lent the overall effect to be a smokiness that offset the sweet of some of the other flavors.  The sweetness comes through in molasses and various fruit flavors¬óraisin, plum, cherry, berries.  Faint bitterness is provided by dark chocolate and coffee.  For an 11% ABV ale, there was surprisingly no alcohol ""bite.""  The flavor matured as the ale warmed, with the smokiness diminished somewhat and the other flavors moved to the foreground.

The Abyss was thick on the tongue.  It engaged the entire mouth equally¬ólip, tongue, gums, palate, the top of the throat.  The sum was definitely the focus, rather than the parts.

Pours opaque black, with a brown, rocky head that reluctantly swells up to the surface. A good inch-plus of dense foam at the peak before decention. Thick webbing of lacework clings to the glass like brown cobwebs.

Intense chocolate and espresso on the pallet. Probably the most chocolate I¬íve ever tasted in an RIS. Fudgy and decadent. 
Hopping is subdued and there¬ís no bitterness to speak of or citrusy resins.

I have been sitting on a bottle of this for a few months now.  Since it was on a few people¬ís want lists I went ahead and cracked it open.  It was a solid imperial stout that I am glad to see making a return.  It¬ís not quite in the class of the best of the best but it is not far off either.  I¬íd say it is on par with anything in the 95 to 99th percentile.
Aroma / Appearance - The midnight black body was almost as dark as it gets without being motor oil.  A one finger muddy head was bordering on red.  Sticky lacing left remnants of strata as I enjoyed my glass.  Oak and vanilla were prominent in the nose along with expresso, brownies, smoke and black cherries.  It wasn¬ít the most complex imperial stout I¬íve tried aroma wise but it was cohesive and enjoyable.
Flavor / Palate - Smoke, oak, vanilla and expresso formed a very nice set of complimentary flavors.  For a barrel aged beer it was easy to drink.  Thick malts coated the mouth without being suffocating.  A nice cherry finish topped it off.  All in all I would say that it was an excellent beer but just short of my personal Top 50.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1032,"2007-10-24",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2012 22 Oz Bottle via tever. An initial blast of chocolate, cherries, cream and bourbon cake evaporates quickly. Nose deep in the glass, I can now only draw thin wisps of salted caramel, cocoa nibs, and coffee char. Nice, but fleeting and volatile. Ruby-corned pitch black, edged in a cappuccino cream rim, lacing beautifully. Flavor comes forth with an expected density and sweetness. Lots of those beautiful estery fruits playing against mature and sentient 88% noir chocolate, then a swift shot into coffee rung alcohols, bright and peppery. Lots of good earth, musky woods and mellowed creams. Barrel seems to play great mediator, tempering the growing hoppiness with the rather complex and dense malt character. Alcohol brightens the whole mood. Nice body, full, yet not sticky, or hot. Rather exemplary and well-showing for the style. Gaussian in nature, it would seem. Bright nuttiness fills the backdoor. There¬ís some really unique, high up, floral spice notes that fill the humours early during the intake, then crescendoing quickly into a flourish of insipid vanilla character. A bit of oxidation in the heavy barrel char. Good use of the barrel, I would say, though. Hops, somewhat as expected for the region, although they tend a little worn out and on the celery side of things. Rather impressed with the level of carbonation this beer gives. I¬ím not sure whether it hurts nor helps. There might be some appreciated viscosity if the carbonation was less, but then less desirable feel might result. Round, deep and on point. Great, but not unique enough for me. Thanks Tom!
UpdateOriginally, I drank the first half of the beer and then recapped the bottle, planning to drink it later. Last night, (10/26/2007) I cracked it open and drank the rest. It was still awesome, so dense, rich, creamy, fruity, sharp, piquant and roasted. Just a full frontal assault of amazing flavor and feel. But, the real stunner came in a side by side with Bells Expedition Stout. A beer I revere so highly paled in comparison to the Abyss. There was flavor and hops, but no density, richness or depth, comparatively. I guess that¬ís what the barrel gives it, so you can¬ít really fairly compare it with a non-barrel aged example of the style. I was numb, I didn¬ít know how to handle this beer upsetting my benchmark. Thus I give it all the respect it deserves and a 4.3","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1032,"2007-10-24",4.6,"Thick vicious pour thats incredible to watch unfold its heft into the chalice. Sits black and thick as newly wettened tar and caps the top with a roof of dark brown foam that¬ís thick, spongy, and lush. Inky glared stings of lace fling about after each sip. 

Aroma is thick and oaky with a dark chocolate heft over a tang of rich molasses, cherry, fig, and the ever present oaky bourbon scent that helps add a bit a of wondefully fulfilling, nose whirling, heat. Trace of burnt coffee ensues with a nice addition to the profile. 

Taste is immaculately woven with dark chocolate and a smoothly thick, lush body tranfused with all sorts of vanilla, molasses, coffee, and bourbon oakyness. A very well balanced and heavy treat. The chocolate is tenderly bittered with the heat and quite dark in its efforts. Anything and everything dark from the cocoa bean has been placed in every inch of its flavor. Spiced with a touch of peppery hops, coffee, and a terrific, if not down right perfect notion of bourbon hints wavered all throughout the chocolatey body. 

This is some pretty thick stuff, noticed in the pour, felt on the palate, and rendered in the gut. Smooth and velvety, thick, lush, and firm with a great creamy sense of chocolate and cream. Nice feathery spiced finish that stays creamy and enduced within a deep, darl chocolatey depth thats quite incredible to behold. It really makes a solid impression.

1032,"2007-10-23",4.0,"Served on the warm side of cool.  The beer pours with a frothy, easily three-finger thick, creamed, chocolate brown colored head that sits atop an opaque, pitch black colored brew.  Aromas of oak and concentrated, burnt malt waft to my nose as I pour this brew.  The first draught of the aroma yield ample roast malt character that makes me think of dark-roasted espresso beans, chocolate malt ball candies, burnt caramel and a huge, toasted malt character that is coupled with an √ºber-nutty aromatic note.  The aroma is quite rich and expressive, the roast malt character clearly dominates.  It is interesting that I was able to smell the oak as I was pouring, but it gets mostly buried under all of the dark malt aromatics when going in for a more dedicated smelling of the aroma.  Having said that the aroma does yield some subtle oak aromatics, including a touch of spicy wood, some soft butterscotch and a hint of a woody backdrop.

Creamy feeling up front, yet somehow still fairly drinkable & light.  After the first sip has left my mouth, the finish at first is roast malt dominated then moves to a spicy oak character, but then a sweet, burnt fruit character becomes noticeable and then it seems to start over again.  This has a very long finish and it seems to move between roast grain notes, light oak character and a rich, concentrated fruitiness.  Quite interesting, and I haven¬ít even taken a second sip yet.  Sweet tasting up front, obviously contributed by an ample malt character (burnt caramel notes);  the sweetness accentuates a bright (though clearly roasted), concentrated, fruit character that runs throughout this beer.  It also accentuates a deep, dark chocolate character that melds quite well with the silky texture.  The burnt fruit notes remind me of raisins, prunes and, especially towards the finish, of cherries.  The oak is really not noticeable until just before the finish where it shows up as a spicy oak character.  It might contribute some soft vanilla notes & perhaps a touch of butterscotch, but these notes really serve to accentuated the malt character rather than really jump out on their own.

Serving this beer so warm (about 65¬∞F / 18¬∞C) has really muted the oak contribution, as the last time I had this it was much more noticeable.  Even when cooler it is still on the subtle side though, which is really what I want in a beer made with oak; add a bit more to the complexity without over doing it is the only way to go.  The proof that this is a very well made stout is that despite the over the top roast character, there is very little harsh acidity contributed by all of the roasted grains.  Definitely not the thickest and richest Imperial Stout out there, but still this is quite satiating and I really like how the various flavor components of this brew balance each other out.  This is simply quite delicious; lots of sweet malt & fruit notes to stand up to the over the top roast character, plus a subtle backdrop of oak to kick the complexity up another notch.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
1032,"2007-10-22",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2008 bottle....appearance: deep black w/ thin tan head.....aroma:  abundance of chocolate with coffee playing a backup role....taste: chocolate reared by bitter roasted coffee beans.  mouthfeel was pretty thin and had little carbonation. slight bitterness in the finish as well. did not have much of a bourbon presence at all......this fell short of my expecations that i had for it.

2006 Batch In long: Wow!  What a soft & creamy but intense stout.  Lots of bitter black chocolate wrapped in molasses wrapped around roasted campfire wood and dipped into black liquorice.  Very roasted.  The leafy hops feel like freshly picked green hops and help to make the beer feel lighter and more drinkable than it should be.  Overall soft creamy cake feeling.

1032,"2007-07-03",4.0,"Ludicrously brown headed ¬ñ quite literally a chocolate mousse sitting above the inky yawn. The foam produces surprising rings of lace and a bubbly film around the glass, flaunting what most Imperial Stouts seem to lack: an intriguing head formation. The nose is quite hoppy for the style, expressing plenty of pine sap which conjugates quite beautifully with the aromatic maple syrup and woody oak. Dry chocolate and gently roasted coffee bean appear in the classic Imperial Stout combination, particularly well executed in this case as it isn¬ít charred. An odd sterile scent of cardboard and plastic appears as well, along with almonds, salted sunflower seeds and a hint of tomato. With warming, a fruity component of pomegranate, strawberry and blackcurrant adds a unique complexity to the fragrance. The flavor is dominated at first by caff√®llatte and elegant vanilla bean. The chocolate, cream and subtle coffee bitterness offer a velvety treat highlighted by appreciable tonalities of black pepper and bell pepper, as well as a malty cookie and caramel backbone. A hint of pine and custard to finish and a long Carambar caramel and coffee aftertaste round the palate very gracefully. Smooth in texture and not too sticky, this is a refreshingly balanced and honest Imperial Stout offering a great deal of originality. Deschutes have set their goal higher than the commonplace annihilation of palates that most other brewers seem to favor in their Imperial Stouts.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

6/08/2007:  When it comes to appearance, The Abyss is pretty much black and opaque.  There is a thick, dark brown head that is long-lasting and leaves fairly detailed lacing that is made of ultra tiny bubbles and covers the inside of the glass from the top to the bottom.  The beer itself leaves a slight oily-like sheen on the glass as well.  The aroma presents coffee with cream, chocolate, some cola, and a hint of sweet licorice.  The flavor is rich and robust with lots of roasted maltiness, bitter dark chocolate, coffee, and some bourbon.  It is slightly dry mid-palate and some  vanilla and oak are noticeable.  The finish is very roasted, possibly bordering on charcoal, with a mild to moderate level of bitterness.  The alcohol is present and warming, but not overbearing or out of place.  The aroma and flavor are definitely deep and intriguing.  Actually, at a warmer temperature, the flavor becomes a really nice, rich cofffe and chocolate with some interlaced bourbon followed by a substantial, balancing bitterness.  This beer has a full body and is smooth and oily, yet somehow thick, soft, and creamy.  The Abyss is really quite good and bold, but it isn¬ít quite as good or complex as other beers in its class (e.g. Dark Lord, AleSmith Speedway, Stone IRS, Goose Island BCS, Avery Mephistopheles, Founder¬ís Kentucky Breakfast, Bell¬ís Expedition and Kalamazoo, Hoppin Frog BORIS, Siberian Night, etc.).  Everything seems to be there in this beer, but nothing stands out to really set this beer apart...

1032,"2007-06-05",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 4, 2011 The Abyss is a landmark beer in every beer drinker¬ís personal history of stouts.  It sits side-by-side with beloved icons of the genre like the Old Yeti and Dark Lord.  And, well, if you append the word ¬ìReserve¬î onto brew like this and dress it up like a wine by giving it a birthdate, you¬íre bound to make an already excellent beer glow like it¬ís its debutante ball.  The Abyss 2009 Reserve, like its more saturnine cousin, ¬ìThe Abyss¬î, is a chocolate beer through all three of my applied senses.  It¬ís thick headed (like me), colored like a patiently melted dark chocolate bar, rising about an inch and a half off the surface.  The body is unsurprisingly black - that terrifying chasm where color shrivels into the fetal position and expires.  Of course, the drawback to this dramatic head and pour is a very thick bulwark to the aroma.  It¬ís a kevlar apron on burly smell, so I bore down into the foam to get a better sense of what the Abyss smells like.  This too is dry and chocolatey, but the head is too well layered for me to get a sense of what else lies underneath.  The flavor is intense, taking the palate by storm, but the beer itself isn¬ít heavy.  The Abyss comes out roaring with alcohol, licorice, jerky spices, more chocolate and a thorough bitter and alcohol that glows all the way down to the gut.  I wrote here in my notes, ¬ìYessir, this is a slow drinker, but that¬ís because it tastes like charcoal.¬î  In retrospect this was meant as more of a compliment.  It¬ís a deep, dark, dusty beer with a lot of potential energy, unearthed from its own cavernous tubs and tubes at Deschutes¬í brewery, and worthy of its praise.
------- appears there¬ís a competition for the most brutally dark beer on the market. Lately I¬íve sampled a motley collection of Imperial Stouts, and all of them have been greased with a nefarious blackness that give it a look more akin of Hell spawn than a drink.  If the criteria is the pursuit of a brackish, oozing look, than the Abyss takes a triumphant win over the very able competition.  But, as exciting as it is to imagine my glass is filled with a putrid goo from the deepest, darkest recesses of a disease ridden jungle, I find that the taste composition is far more important.  How does the Abyss fair with the senses?  I am happy to note that it does very well.  To mine near sighted eye it is black as crude oil, with a sheen like a well oiled otter¬ís coat.  The head is a brown hue like the coats of charcoal pollution that lent Victorian England its marketable charm, making a perfect match with some of those old stuffy caverns for the blue collar worker ¬ñ the walls, floors and even the patrons faces at the Cheshire Cheese are the finest examples of this particular shade.  The head is further detailed with a wart and pock finish and a craterous center giving the full effect of a terrible dermatological condition.  The aroma departs from the ghastly, ghoulish effects of the pour to play up the sophistry inherit in the Abyss¬í clever manufacture.  The incipient aromas boast potato, beef, soy sauce and Tootsie-Rolls.  Then a sipid band of dust, cobwebs, leather and charcoal parade into the nose, manifesting the illusion of an old craftsman market.  The slightest tinge of hops reminds me that it is still a beer, pulling me back to the drink and introducing some afterthought smells: grilled sweet corn, char and cucumber.  I¬ím suddenly stricken with a ravenous hunger for Southwestern cuisine.  The Abyss falls on the tongue like a blacksmith¬ís hammer to the anvil.  It is both crude and merciless, swearing off sugar to let the full force of the char and beef flavors through.  The very start of the sip has a little molasses note that slinks its way through the noise of more dominant flavors, too.  For the aftertaste the carbonized flavors of beef and char pair up with a strong dash of coffee and meander around the tongue for a good long awhile before they finally make an agonizingly slow and prolonged exit down the back of the tongue.  Here and there are short cameos by all spice and chocolate truffle, but The Abyss predominantly relies on its core flavors to deliver its punch. Despite the industrial petroleum like appearance of The Abyss, the weight and carbonation are both well balanced and lighter than I expected.  Considering the flavor I anticipated a cross between dark matter and mercury, but found the palate both pleasing and suitable.  In the multifarious line up of similar stouts, the Abyss stands out as more sophisticated.  At the top of the list is a brilliant bouquet.  I also appreciate the risk the Desachutes Brewers took when they abandoned the sweet for the hardcore flavors only a grill cleaner could like.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

The vanilla is very subtle and subdued in the chocolate malt being present. For a 11% this is very smooth and the mouthfeel is just shy of perfect. Has a slight dryness to it that enables it to be a beer that can quench whatever thirst you have in your mouth, but be able to satisfy your soul with a maltyness that just screams into your existence of ""this is what you are!, embrass me.""

There is plenty of roasted malt and chocolate, but I am not getting any of the wood or smokiness I remember and no vanilla either.  Some alcohol notes in the flavor as well.

1032,"2007-03-03",4.6,"In the bomber bottle from Wilbur¬ís. Pours a Heinz Ketchup-thick black potion with the darkest brown head I¬íve ever seen on a beer. Aroma unfolds majestically with a serious hazelnut scent, subsequently followed by the smell of roasted coffee. The flavor is thick with extreme blackstrap molasses sweetness, licorice, and such an astringent coffee bitterness that I had no idea I had bitter receptors that far back on my tongue. Long lingering coffee bitter dryness on the back sides of the tongue. Incredible. Head remains big and thick from start to finish.

1032,"2007-02-24",4.8,"To me this is one of the greatest stouts out there! This beer is AMAZINGLY good - and unfortunately hard to find - for me anyways. This one pours black as black can be. You can tell right from the pour that you¬íre going to have one helluva ride because it glugs... like motor oil. This beer is very complex with vanilla, black licorice, coffee, oak, dark chocolate and other flavors. Hops even things out nicely. Man this beer is so tasty. Almost a perfect score, but I had to leave just a tiny bit of room because althought I don¬ít believe it... I guess there could be better.  I¬íve had most of the top rated stouts except for Dark Lord. That¬ís the only beer that stands a chance against this amazing creation by Deschutes.  One last comment about Deschutes...

Ashy burnt and bitter coffee and chocolate tones reign supreme as the barrel aging plays only a very minor role.  Faint hints of blackend berry and vanilla round out this rich full bodied brew out.

My first impression of the aroma consisted of sweeter roasted chocolates and coffee.. sweeter than expected... as it warmed up, charred oak and vanilla integrate nicely along with smoky molasses.. burnt espresso too.   The flavor finds  heavily-roasted dark malts (espresso, baker¬ís chocolate, licorice, and molasses) with a very complimentary barrel influence (charred oak and vanilla), sweet, but distant bourbon sugars, and alcohol warmth... the finish was long and coffee-based.. a tad grainy and warm.  Thick on the palate but flowed rather quickly across thanks to alcohol and coffee + woody bitterness... rich, warm, and satisfying!   Excellent stuff!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

Possibly the thickest stout i have ever head. Almost like syrup. The primary flavors are the roastiness and the licorice, not to say that it tastes like licorice but the flavor is definitely there. The oaky an vanilla flavors are much more subtle and mostly serve to round it out and mellows it down a little.I poured this in a goblet, after finishing my glass and going to rinse it our I noticed there was a thick syrup still in the bottom of the glass.

2007 vintage, thanks to holdenn for sharing at P4. looks fantastic, black with creamy tan head. extremely dry bakers chocolate nose. flavor is also very dry and chalky chocolate notes. not a lot going on and this is extremely dry. i dont know how age will improve that though. we¬íll see.3.6. 

1/3/09, ‚Äô06 vs. ‚Äô08. both look great, black with creamy tan head. The ‚Äô06 aged into a more complex dark chocolate and coffee notes with the original ashy character sliding more into the background of the beer as it is still pretty dry. very smooth finish to this. The ‚Äô08 had a big out of place green hop character with that original Abyss ash tray quailty. Clearly 2 years helps this beer a lot as this is the first time I actually enjoyed Abyss.

1032,"2007-02-02",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2007 22 oz Bomber. Tres Fancy. The aroma is rich roasted malt and chocolate with licorice, cocoa and a faintly dusty earhty aroma that could be oak. Decent smelling, but not mind blowing. The body is a stygian black that absorbs light and easily supports a two finger thick head that is both frothy and creamy looking and that doesn¬ít yield ground very readily, staying erect and ready long after my normal 5 minute sniffing routine.
<P>
Flavor is somewhat low key with licorice, molasses, coffee, chocolate, fudge and piney hops making a massive play at subtlety, but not offering anything mega-fantastic as far as flavor concetration. It has a creamy chocolatepudding flavor/feel to it that is very enticing and lets you forget shortcomings. There is also a spicy note in the far finish that I assume is the oak. Other than that, and a mild dusty, earthy, woody feel also in the aftertaste,  the oak is reserved.

Lots of roasted malts, cold, bitter coffee, alcohol notes, licorice, oily, piney hops, burnt wood and dark chocolate. There¬ís almost some Jagermeister like flavors at times. Body is full but still creamy and slick. LOTS of lingering bitterness throughout this entire experience.

1032,"2007-01-28",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2007 Pours thick and opaque black with a thin cap, slowly diminishing. The head is an odd looking combination of light brown with some white swirls. Upon nosing I¬ím surprised how mild the aromas of chocolate and roasted malts are. The bourbon is at a medium level, vanilla large and looming. Hops are kept at bay in the pleasant aroma, while oak and molasses flourish. Flavor is bitter hops, chocolate, licorice and a nice combination of molases and wood. The bourbon is much more dominant, almost crushing, in the flavor. Also noted are more vanilla and alot of sugary syrup. The woodiness is biting, raw and jagged. Finishes dry and very tannic, an oak bite is dangling about on my tongue for a while, and feels like it¬ís cutting into it. Far too much oak character for a stout that is only comprised of a third of the final product having seen barrel aging. The part of the oak that has a new French barrel is quite tasty though and adds a welcomed dimension to a new beer. Soft on the palate for the most part, if not for the lashing my tongue recieves from the brash oak. Other than the French oak character this is just another imperial stout. Not enough malt to excite, not enough hops to interest, not enough unique character to elicit my curiosity again. It is a smooth one, but so was the Jacobsen Dark Lager I tried that night, and it was garbage. I had hoped for more.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

1032,"2007-01-21",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2010 On tap into a English Pint at Duck Island in Seattle, WA, and out of a 22 oz bottle.  I will compare the differences later.  This black beauty pours that ever so wonderous dark-as-night black with almost no head whatsoever, but with traces of dark tanned lacing.  Ruby colored edges can be seen when held up to the light.  The aroma wafting of this one brings a huge hint of vanillad coffee, roasted dark malts, an intense woody note, and a tiny touch of bourbon.  The onslaught to the palate begins with that ever so delicate vanilla flavor intertwined with sweet malts before being overtaken by the dark molassesy and roasty malt body.  As this happens the depth of this brew comes out.  The bourbon soaked wood flavor touches the tongue very lightly (lighter than expected).  A deep chocolate and coffee note moves into the flavor and begins to finish the taste.  Bourbon, wood, and light vanilla resins linger on the palate as you feel a slight alcohol singe up the nostrils and on the edge of the back of your tongue.  Definitely can feel the warmth on its way down.  Thick and silky smooth feel on the palate.  Very full bodied.  On tap this felt much smoother and not as intense in most of the areas.  Enjoyable in both ways, but if you want the fullest experience, let a bottle warm to 55 degrees and drink it out of a Snifter.  Overall an amazing brew (the best from Deschutes in a while), but definitely is second still to the Full Sail Black Gold (which is not a bad place to be at all!!).

Not really too much more description to add on the rerate a year later with the new batch...but I found it much more enjoyable without the off flavors I noted last year.

Doesn¬ít pour so much as it oozes. The molasses and anise they promise are there in the mid-palate but they¬íre subtle, they¬íre overwhelmed by roast and coffee and char.

1032,"2007-01-08",3.8,"Black body with hints of brown at the edges. Thin covering of well-retained beige cream. Polished aromas of roasted malt, nutty oak, and coffee-infused fudge. Smidgeon of molasses. Fruity-hoppy with some sprucelike whispers to boot. Natural carbonation snugly embraces the palate. Pure oak immediately touts its luster amid an early surge of gritty roast, with an ever-tightening clasp and toasty firmness. Bittersweet chocolate and potent notes of tarry java comprise much of the core, before the earthy roast gathers steam and generates substantial nuttiness and dryness. Some thick yeast is perceptible, but the attenuation is virtually impeccable, and just enough residual sweetness remains which pillars the body with a supple coffee and fudgelike richness. Although the hops do generate some acidity, it comes off as being fairly sweet due to the utter lack of estery fruitiness. Vibrant conifer-laden hop bitterness hangs on through its entirety and enhances the minty/alcoholic dryness, but never detracts from the malt complexity. Finishes slightly chewy and semi-tacky with molasses and yeast, but the prominent roastiness masks a large portion of the burnt malts which try but largely fail to deepen the roast and negate some of the residuals. Not the most exciting aroma (slightly vegetal, and not nearly estery/fruity enough to withstand the prominent roastiness), but the body is voluptuous and virtually flawless. A few minor tweakings would really make this a standout.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

I knew I was in for a treat. Aroma is comprised of smoke, coffee, and roast. Some hints of tobacco and a little bit of chocolate. The hops come out mostly bitter, but there is just a touch more. Dark fruits muster about. Flavor disguises the heat of the alcohol with an onslaught of roast and bitterness. Coffee and a touch of chocolate compliment the malts as the bitter hops come out. There is also a touch of piney hops about. The body is thick and chewy. It is rather cloying as this lovely beer leaves its touch on me.

Some citrus hops in the finish as well but they are subdued as they should be (and so often are overpowering in a West Coast Imp stout....i hate grapefruit in stouts and am so glad this one does not have that) No hint of the alcohol.

Think chocolate cheesecake with almonds on top and a bit of rum, baked on great grandma¬ís old woodstove! Mmmmm tastes just like that but with pure cacao. I wonder if most people know the joys of pure cacao, without manmade processed crap that is added to chocolate like milk, sugar....in any case, this reminds me of my 85% lindemans cacao bar dipped in some coffee that i roasted at full city +...anyways this is good..but needs a mix of 50/50 i think instead of only 33% oak.....whatever..it is all good.

1032,"2007-01-05",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2010 2006 Reserve.  Black pour with a full, light brown, creamy, pillowy head;  good longevity and excellent lacing.  Nice nose, just not bold; notes of molasses, chicory, and the bourbon oak barrels with lighter notes of coffee, dark chocolate, anise, and faint wisps of alcohol.  The taste is so much more oak barrels; dry oak, light coffee roast,  and an earthy/cedar hop note create a moderately high bitterness with other flavors including chocolate, licorice, and burnt nutty toast.  Palate is thick and round, almost velvety, but only medium-full in body (time would greatly improve this), and soft to lively.  The flavor continues to dry out and you find the sweet malty flavors emerge more until the finish; dry, burnt, nutty, oak-filled roastedness with some chocolate and licorice and a moderate length.  A faint, dark fruit character keeps presenting itself in the nose and taste, but it is hidden beneath the other flavors.  Very well done oaked imp with the flavors melding so well together, perfect balance between malt complexity, hop bitterness, and oak bourbon flavors.  The oak is prominant in the flavor but subtle enough to enjoy the other complex flavors.  One of my favorites of the style.

2007 vintage rated 5-24-10.  The nose is gaining some burnt toffee notes to match the other complexities.  The palate is still very nice but not as full as I thought it would be after two years.  The flavor is much of the same; still not overly rich and still carrying the oak bitterness nicely.  And the dark fruit notes are not really noted anymore.  Still one of favorites but not much has changed after a two year waiting period.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

1032,"2007-01-01",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 22, 2014 2006 vintage.
January 1, 2007: Very fresh. (this was just released a few days ago). Pours a thick oily black with a modest tan head. At this tender age, the subtler aspects of the nose is overwhelmed by the bourbon, but the flavor profile has no such shortcoming; there the bourbon stays in the background, letting dark chocolate and licorice mingle, coaxing forth hints of salt and wood smoke, hops coming in decisively but not over-aggressive on the finish to close with a bitter-chocolate ending with tinges of blueberry.  Mouthfeel is slightly thin, but that¬ís a relatively minor quibble. This is a very good imperial stout.

October 26, 2007: Ten months in this one is coming along very nicely. The original review still fits quite closely. The bourbon is still strong on the lead and the hops are still quite strong on the tail; the former could use some time to blend and the latter some time to age. I¬íll be back to try another bottle in another 10 months or so...if I can wait that long.

January 19, 2008. 
Purchased today (it sold out all over town in a matter of hours) and tasted today as well. Doesn¬ít get any fresher than that. Big juice-and-blackberry with vanilla bourbon nose; the bourbon isn¬ít overpowering, just enjoyable. As with last year, the bourbon is mellow in the flavor, blueberries meet chocolate and smoke, licorice dances with hops and just the right amount of ash for a dry close. Splendid. I think this might be drinking even better, earlier, than the ¬í06 was, at least on it¬ís release day. Original rating stands.

 3/13/2010. Lovely, the Abyss I remember. Not much of the berries, but plenty of molasses and licorice. 
6/2/2010Dang this is smooth and drinking well. As above, the blackberries gone but the beer is so fine and well integrated.
8/6/2012Still holding up beautifully after 5 years. Hints of sourness, bitter cocoa with molasses and licorice. 
2008 Vintage
12/20/2008. A bit hot at the first pour, but as it approaches room temperature it comes into its own, much as the 2007 was at this time last year. Lovely. 
2009 Vintage
4/20/2010 draft at Fiddlers.Dark chocolates and less of the oak-and-bourbon than I recall, but also less heat -- very smooth drinking, if not for the thickness and flavor intensity I could have called this one at 8-9% instead of >10%. Seems like a bit of a different beer this go around.
2011 Vintage
4/18/2011 draft at Fiddlers. More ash, again less oak, plenty of molasses though, a bit on the hot side.
2014? Vintage 4/22/2014 draft at Fiddlers. Coffee and licorice and a mild touch of ash; blueberry and blackberry juice early, citric hops buried in there somewhere. Tasty to savor over an hour and decidedly better as it warmed.

1032,"2006-12-28",5.0,"Pours opaque black with a billowy tan head. The nose is coffee, chocolate liqueuer, licorice, vanilla, chestmut, and bourbon. 

The flavor is almost as complex as the aroma with the bourbon, and merlot being more muted than I expected, but not in a ""they¬íre almost undetectable"" sort of way. Rather, those flavors serve as underpinnings (in an almost catalystic manner) that bring out the intensity of the more obvious esters like bitter chocolate, roast coffee, vanilla, licorice, toffee, chestnut, salt, and almost a smoky bacon quality.

At first I thought the body was a tad thin to support such a dynamic flavor profile, but then I realized that if it were thicker, it would make the flavor almost too mouth coating and intense to be as drinkable as it is. 

I agree with the other reviewers who think this beer will be an aging marvel, but for me it is already an absolutely ideal imperial stout, which I  find even more rounded and complex than Speedway, and even more remarkable for achieving its decidedly coffeeish flavor component without the  actual addition of  that ingredient.
