Pours a semi-opaque dirty rusty brown colour with an off-white head. Nose is brown sugar, Belgian yeasts, and dark fruits. Having sampled this before from a keg I recall it being very sweet. Having aged this bottle some taking in the new year, I find the sweetness has mellowed. Flavour has a lot going on in a good way. Toffee and brown sugar is present but not overbearing. Perhaps my palate is biased from the stoic, but once again I get the flavours of dark cherries, christmas cake mixed with some mild boozyness. Overall Im really enjoying this, more so than the stoic.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiery_1"
2290,"2016-12-28",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 2, 2017 Poured from a bomber bottle into a short glass to drink. The beer had a cloudy and dark amber-copper color with a dark brown hue and a small foamy and creamy tan head with shorter retention and minimal cling and lacing. Its aroma featured strong notes of fruit malt, spices, floral hops, and a scent of brandy and malt liquor. The taste was somewhat sweet and fruity with a sour malt and floral effect. The beer was fairly thick in the mouth with average carbonation, and a noticeable presence of alcohol.  Big thanks to Eric for the special present!","Denver, Colorado, USA","Derek881"

I taste the influence of the Belgian yeast, raisan/port/fig fruitiness (pomegranate molasses), as well as the wine and whiskey barrels. But none of those dominate. Instead they blend nicely together.  You know you are drinking a 12%ABV, but this beer doesnt make it a challenge.","Lansing, Michigan, USA","blackflag321"

It shows a subtle fruit like hint but I never would have guessed pomegranate. Lots of pitted fruits raisin, dates, figs. The whiskey is pretty light, as is the wine influence. Even after this much time, the alcohol is still VERY obvious. A bit much in the booze category. I thought now would be a good time to open it. Perhaps it could use just a bit more time?

Lots of sweet caramel, spiced cake, and a whole lot of grape/raisin. This is an intense beer in all facets. The mouthfeel leaves something to be desired, though...not much carbonation.

2290,"2016-02-23",3.8,"Poured into a snifter.

3.5 A: Clear deep amber color. Under one finger of beige head formed and quickly fell without leaving any lacing.

4.25 S: Quite enticing. The pomegranate hits you hard, but its fruitiness does not run solo. Fig, date, and plum follow with some sweet orange peel. Vinous grape, vanilla, and oak. While I cant smell the rye whiskey directly, I can sense it is blending with the other flavors. Im not getting much spice from the nose, but thats probably because the pomegranate is so powerful.

4.0 T: The spice does come out well in the taste - peppery which complements the earthy rye spiciness and the subtle boozy heat. The wine barrel also is more potent as the vinous grape matches the power of the pomegranate. Again lots of plum, fig, and date to accompany. Vanilla and oak with a touch of tannic astringency.

4.5 M: Medium to heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation with a spritziness that makes this light on the tongue. Warming boozy finish.

4.25 D: Very nice beer. It has some powerful flavors that all mesh well together all while being quite drinkable.

The nose is full of roasted notes with undertones of caramel, dried fruit, woody bourbon, herby spice, a light vanilla, and further down, candy sugar, with a late touch of acetone warmth. Its a deep and oily orange-brown, amber with sediment thats topped by a foamy, soapy head. It retains a medium thin ring, some surface wisps, and a light, dense lace. The taste is a high sweetness complimented by a medium high bitter. The beer is thick and oily with a fuzzy carbonation. The full body contains a dominant flavor of dried fruit, with complimentary notes of wood and spice and a caramel character that strengthens near the end of the bottle. It finishes spicy and dry with a fruity zest. Its crisp with a nice alcohol warmth on the way down.

The yeast is muted and there are many other flavors going on to take you away from your typical quad expectations. For fans of the style, this may be a bad thing.

Poured with shakey hands,12 hours with nothing but coffee and some cheap irish cream apparently makes my hands tremble, good to know. Not much of a head even with my palsey, deep marroon body with some small bubbles showing that this is not angels share. Boozed up red wine nose with definite barrel notes. should know if my stove will get a full boil going before i finish this beer, then i can figure out homebrewing supplies in New Mexico! Molasses, strawberry, and red wine hit me first, warming alcohol, followed by light vanilla, a very faint wood note, much less than i expected after smelling this. lingering raisin and some tannin like bitterness from the wine notes. just a hint of the floral earthy hops in there that are working well to allow the malt to shine. no real yeast notes apparent to me. something like marshmallows emerge in the finish as this warms, and the nose really opens up to give a more pronounced wine taste. bit of spice and sweet alcohol really gets better the slower i drink this. a fun one to sip on for an hour or so.

rerate 5/3 from same batch. pours a dark amber brown with a big grey head. smells of berries and booze with a caramel hint. warming flavor of alcohol, strawberry, and a bunch of caramel. light bitterness that is a bit pineapple like. muffin like bread notes throughout this with a bit of pepper and just a touch of a blood like flavor. a reat sipper i have spent just shy of 3 hours enjoying. made a point of not reading my initial review as i did not want to taint my notes on the older version, really enjoyed this. last rating was 7 2 7 3 16 . this one is a 6 4 7 4 17","Montana, USA","Kevin"

It pours a clear auburn with an off white head of foam thats about an inch thick. The foam starts to shrink and leaves some pretty lacing behind.

The nose the barrel aging goodness of oak up front with it leaning more towards the rye whisky barrel than the wine barrel. Sweet notes from the molasses are not timid and the fruitiness must be from the pomegranate; Ive never actually ate one of them. Nyuck, Nyuck. With 30% of the beer hitting the barrel, I expected some booze to show up and it does.

Ha. That fruitiness is the first thing I notice with the oak barrel aging, rye first-wine second but not by much. The sweet from the molasses comes in next and to my reckoning, does not make this brew overly sweet. The 10% abv? Yep, its there. Tolerable.

This is, to my mind, a full bodied brew with a light but right level of carbonation. Just a bit of fizz on my tongue right before the swallow.

Pours a maroon to medium brown with a bright reddish copper hue and a small amount of beige head. Looks good. Scents of plum, banana, and caramel. Orange tartness and a cool, wintry dustiness in the aroma. It was served excessively cold, thus numbing and dumbing down the aroma. Boozy bitterness in the flavor. Spicy (cinnamon, cumin). Lemon tartness. Bready (muffin, banana bread). Chocolate-covered raisin and caramel flavors. Plummy finish and aftertaste. Not the Stoic straddles the line between a subpar American imitation and an authentic Belgian taste. It ends up good but not great. Lively in the palate. Medium to full body. The palate similarly verges on that excessive, thin, hot frothiness of poor Belgian imitations but ultimately is okay. This beer would be good to pair with dinner or dessert, I suspect, but, unfortunately, I was not eating as I consumed it. It has a nice aroma and flavor but they are not strong enough. Again, it would have helped if Republic, which wants to be considered a top notch beer bar, didnt serve its beer at refrigerator temperatures.
