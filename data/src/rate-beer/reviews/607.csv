A: Near black shade and dark brown at the crest of the beer. Small beige head that leaves a crema layer resting atop the liquid. There are random spots of lacing noticeable on the glass.

S: Heavily roasted malt, coffee, bitter chocolate, cocoa

T: The beer tastes pretty decent and has a few different nice flavors happening. The coffee aspect tastes a little too bitter to me. I wonder what kind of coffee was used in the brewing process. Nice notes of chocolate throughout the taste. There is not nearly as much of a lactic presence as I was expecting. Perhaps the roasted malt and coffee flavors have masked the milk portion of the beer.

M: Decent feel, though a bit too bitter. The bitterness continues into the finish and through to the aftertaste. Alcohol is hidden well.

607,"2012-04-15",4.1,"This beer has been aged in my cellar since purchase. Wanted to see how it would change with age. Its probably past its prime.

A - Pours jet black with a medium tan color head. Light lacing on glass and the head dissipated quickly.

S - Very sweet blackberry, currant, with espresso lightly in the background. The coffee has really mellowed out since last time i had this and the sweet berry smells are overpowering everything else.

T - The taste of this beer now reminds me of a chocolate covered blackberry mixed with espresso. Definately get the a smooth coffee finish but has mellowed out significantly since it was bottled. Alcohol present on the finish.

M - Smooth and perfect level of carbonation for the style, in my opinion. Can get the alcohol a bit on the backend.

O - Overall, at the time of release, this was one of my favorite Surly beers however it has changed significantly from what i had remembered. Its still a fabulous milk stout but in my opinion, this beer is past its prime, so if anyone has any, you should consider consuming it now. Im very surprised at how sweet/tart this beer has converted to, i dont remember it being so sweet orginally - most likely because the espresso was stronger and balanced it better.

607,"2012-03-06",4.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 7/6/2011.  Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip. Thanks to Dunt for bringing this bottle.

Out of the bottle comes a mahogany brown, viscous liquid with ruby edges. A quick-fading brown head forms with the initial pour.

The aroma is full of balanced roast malt, nice full espresso and milk chocolate aroma, like chocolate covered espresso beans.

The flavor is very smooth, one of the key features I enjoy about milk stouts. It starts with some molasses sweetness and a sugary lactose flavor that lingers throughout. A milk chocolate presence turns from sweet to bitter as the sip progresses. The dark roasted malt starts to play a factor and a burst of espresso comes through, leading toward a bitter end. Just a touch of booze at the finish.

The mouthfeel is creamy although not over the top. The lactose adds an extra layer to the smoothness. There is a noticeable level of carbonation, maybe just a bit much, and there is a definite stickiness to the texture. All of this is wrapped in a fuller than medium body. To create a 10% milk stout that does not have an over the top body takes some great skill, and I definitely appreciate the effort.

This is a very enjoyable beer. The flavors blend very well together and the rich, creamy mouthfeel supports the flavor nicely.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
607,"2012-02-02",4.5,"Four pours pitch black with a two finger tan head.  Smooth looking head without much bubbles or crators.  Retention is good but over time goes down to a small lacing around the glass.

The smell on this beer is inviting.  Very sweet aroma mixed in with roasted malt and coffee.  Sweetness took the number one aroma in this beer followed by the coffee.  Hints of chocolate round out the smell.  Wow!  The way everything comes together just hit the spot for me.  If I could wake up to that smell everyday, everything would be right in this world.

At 10% abv you would think some kind of alcohol would come through on this beer but nope it doesnt.  Instead the espresso comes through like a champ.  Coffee and chocolate.  Then the sweetness comes in and lingers in with the rest of the ingredients and leaves just an awesome aftertaste.

607,"2011-04-02",4.5,"Big thanks to millah (BA) for hooking me up with this one.  I had heard the coffee taste was starting to fade so I decided it was time.  If it has faded, cant believe the intensity of the coffee it it were fresher.

AROMA: Intense espresso aroma, some raisin scent, picking up some chocolate and vanilla.
APPEARANCE:  Poured into a Grump Troll snifter.  Pours dark dark brown with some lighter brown colors visible on the edges.  Just a tad bit of head that dissipates and then a very thin layer remains in the glass.  There is also some lacing and with each pour it clings to the glass.
TASTE: First taste is a warming and sweet and quickly turns to bitter chocolate, coffee, buttermilk, lingering taste of German chocolate cake and vanilla.
PALATE: Silky smooth, yet full bodied.  Finish is long.
OVERALL: Great beer that goes down too easy.  Nearly 10% ABV, you cant even tell.  It is too bad this isnt part of their seasonal lineup.","Oswego, Illinois, USA","bradner"

607,"2011-03-01",4.4,"Poured from 750 ml bottle into big fat snifter.
nice dark black color with brown highlights. nice mocha colored fluffy head about a solid finger thick. head retention is good as all the way through the beer there was a nice layer of foam that slid around on the top of the beer.

tons of chocolate esspresso and mocha scents. small amount of sweet malt in the back but covered by the roastiness of the espresso and the roasted barley. There is definately alcohol in here, the smell isnt heavy but enough to take note of it. There is a huge sweetness taht carries through this that im sure is from the lactose, like whip cream or sweet cream butter(no not like popcorn butter...)more like sweet butter cream frosting. 

The taste follows this profile. tastes like a triple shot mocha once the dollop of whipping cream starts to melt into the mocha. There are burnt sugar notes and some coffee and roasted barley bitterness. The sweetness would be overpowering if not for the addition of the astringency from the roasted barley and espresso. wonderful little taste play in the mouth. A bit of Vanilla cigar smoke finds a way to place itself in the taste here and there.

This stuff is really creamy and smooth on the mouth. sticks to your lips especially on the last few sips when it has gotten warm. once again, this is like a mocha with whipped cream. its not syrupy like i was sort of expecting, the body is medium to thick, but not heavy.

the drinkability is very high for a big beast like this. i think the heavy sweetness is what makes it the most difficult to plow through. I think oak aging this would rule the universe. just to dry it out a little bit. mmm, delicious.

This is definately a dessert beer. Id maybe have a raisin oatmeal cookie with it for dunking... or a good scone. I guess i could see a super rich dark black bitter chocolate cake, but this beer is so rich on its own, that might just be too much. Ill stick with my oatmeal cookie :)","Bloomington, Minnesota, USA","SourNotes"

Roast and coffee carries it along. Strong liquorice also perceptible. Lots of carbonation and a full, lush body. Hoppy, rather than roasty bitterness. Also some earthy components.

Chocolate cake, caramel, and roasted espresso follow, which adds nice depth to the brew. Not as roasty or smokey as I was hoping for though.

607,"2010-12-01",4.0,"Big thanks to two generous Minnesota traders for getting me out bottles of this.

A: Wow! Pours very dark with a huge, billowing cream-colored head that lasts for quite some time and leaves behind multiple rings of sticky lacing.

S: Very nice dry roasted malt scent comes up behind an overwhelming force of espresso. Some creamy sweetness in the background, but the espresso beans really just take this one over.

T: Similar to the nose, although the lactose definitely makes a bit more of an appearance here, lending some sweetness behind the competing sources of roasted character.

M: A bit too dry and harsh, something which I would think the lactose could lighten up a bit.

D: Not the best, as the flavors dont really work together. This is certainly a coffee bomb, which I ordinarily like, but think it pales in comparison to some of the best Ive had. It doesnt quite have the expressive hop character of fresh FBS, nor does it have the smooth creaminess that comes alongside the coffee character with Bullfrogs Double Coffee Stout.

607,"2010-10-26",3.6,"750ml bottle, consumed at just under 6 months of age in September 2010.  The pour yields a dark mahogany body that shows a clear, translucent outer edge.  A frothy, bubbly, grayish-khaki head is slowly fading, leaving a good amount of wet, spotted lacing behind.  The nose seems have turned south a little, suggesting (albeit very subtly) notes of cardboard lingering in the background.  Fighting through that somewhat stale overtone is a distinctly lactic creaminess, along with notes of iced coffee, dried caramel, and some coffee cake with chocolate icing.  Its mainly sweet, with little in the way of robust roast.  Flavors are again very milky and lactic, hinting at iced coffee and flaky chocolate cake.  Caramel again imparts a dry sweetness.

As my palate took a beating from sour beers and high ABV monsters I walked past the Surly booth. Getting an exceptionally generous pour (over a quarter of a liter) I took advantage of the shade to savor a fantastic anniversary beer. I cant wait to see what next year brings. Knowing Omar and company Surly Five is going to be nothing short of solid. I know I will be looking for bottles.

Aroma / Appearance - Fluid black and a little oily the body looked like a cold cup of black coffee. Offwhite head was a little like vanilla frosting. Charcoal, malt, and iced coffee give this not only sweetness but also a dry impression.

Flavor / Palate - Smoked malts (a little like the residual water from rinsing an ash tray) melded with black coffee at the start. Smooth and easy on the palate for being almost 10% I hope I can get a bottle of this to try on a day when I am not stuffed from 20+ generous pours of world class beers.

(part of a day of drinking some incredible brews, so this might have downward bias in the presence of such other great beers)

Pours dark black, with hints of brown in the light.  Very little head.

Because of the head, I couldnt get much aroma.  There was definitely some cofffee and chocolate, and then a strange fruity note that I usually only get in baltic porters.

Flavor has some solid sweetness, but then a really off bitter coffee flavor.  I am not a coffee snob by any means, but this was not good.

Carbonation was okay for the style, but I kind of wanted a little more.  Other than that, it was med-heavy bodied and very smooth, not oily.

Overall, a bit of a disappointment.  I was hoping for the second coming of Depth charge (one of my favorite beers of 2009), but it didnt live up to my expectations.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","cprochak"

I was a little disappointed in this one, but am willing to give it another go if I can catch it this season.

rerate 9-17-10

I dont know what to make of this. The tap at 28 should have been as well monitored as any tap of this beer, but the bottle I opened today isnt anything like what I had at the restaurant. And the bottle is light-years superior.

poured at cellar temp this is an all-but opaque red brown under a half inch head. Nose is coffee and sweet with the roasted elements of coffee dominating. The sweet is back and big in the taste and the palate is smooth and well balanced with a slightly thick mouth feel and a quick bite from the roasted bitterness at the end. Finish is definitely sweet with bitter chocolate notes and some black cherry flavors as well. No sense of boozieness at all in this sample.  Comes way up in my estimation, but not to the level of a 4.

607,"2010-02-06",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2010 surly four was my pick for the snowshoe award at winterfest 2010, too bad it lost.  pours deep black with heavy creamy tan head.  nose is sweetness, coffee and fig.  mouthfeel is very smooth and a little heavier.   taste is amazing and complex.  coffee isnt as pronounced as i would have liked, but enough that you know its there.  fairly sweet with candy sugars along dark fruit and fig.  Leaves a little dry bit afterwards, like it was wood-aged.  tastes similar to darkness without  the hops.  one of my new all time favorites.  looking forward to the bottle release and cellaring some.","Burnsville, Minnesota, USA","sbroome"
607,"2010-02-06",4.0,"Pours an opaque, thick chocolate brown with a thin but solid layer of tan-colored head. Aroma is a mix of raisin and fig with chocolate vanilla notes. Flavor is not as sweet as the aroma. A mix of chocolate and dark coffee. Mild licorice notes. Boyd is creamy with light carbonation.","Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA","Tripplebrew"
