1219,"2017-06-03",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2017 330 ml bottle. Pours a nearly black dark brown with a quickly disappearing beige head. Relatively mild aroma, some sweet malt - caramel, molasses, chocolate. Full body with a heavy sweetness, a light bitterness and a medium carbonation. The flavor is very malty, honey, brown sugar, caramel, chocolate, dried fruits, molasses and some herbal hoppy notes. Very rich taste, which is dominated by the sweet malt, with a lightly alcoholic, warming sensation.","AUSTRIA","PowY"
1219,"2017-05-07",3.8,"Bouteille Un liquide noir avec une mousse éparse. Un nez intense de chocolat et caramel (cassonade et mélasse). Toouche de fruits confits. Une bouche ronde, chaude, mielleuse avec saveurs sirupeuses de fuits confits, de mélasse. Une sorte de porto. Franchement surprenante.","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","rodenbach99"
1219,"2017-04-15",3.4,"UPDATED: APR 15, 2017 Bottle. Brown color with beige head. Aroma is toffee, molasses. Taste is molasses, chocolate, brown sugar. High carbonation. Sweet as hell.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","SinH4"
1219,"2017-03-25",4.1,"This is a very big beer. Its more along the line of an English barley wine. A little reminiscent of a Belgian dubbel as well. Its the strongest ""Doppelbock"" I know of and I think the finish is too sweet to qualify. Its a guilty pleasure. No need for more than one.","Massachusetts, USA","ludhaber"
1219,"2017-03-25",4.1,"Wonderful aroma, full flavor, malty but just a little sweet. Slightly bitter finish. March madness 2017","Virginia, USA","bigben873"
1219,"2017-03-07",4.1,"Tallahassee, Fl -ABC Fine Wine & Spirits - Apalachee Parkway - 11.2 oz bottle. Ruby Red leading to dark brown pour, initial bubbly off-white head that fades quickly. Aroma has some sweet date accents, a slight hint of mellow booziness, some molasses. Flavor of moist canned brown bread, dates, prunes and just a hint of chocolate. Deceptively smooth considering the ABV. Chewy, thick mouthfeel. Excellent winter warmer.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"

// ou must make the difference with this one.. Deep malty is very different than sweet.. Very rich and still forgiving. Thick on the palate with no questions.. Samichlaus has moved on beyond the normal boundaries... I still dig this one better than the Helles.

1219,"2017-02-25",3.5,"Bottle from Belmont Station. Saw that this came out and had to try it.

A: Dark mahogany thats almost black. Light cappuccino head. Lacing.

N: Toffee, black licorice, brandy, some cherry, cocoa, hint of vanilla, light woodiness. Raisin and prune. Fig. Toast and brown sugar. Lots and lots of sugar. Peppercorn and rye bread.

T: Very, very, very sweet. Cloying. Lightly sweet.

M: Huuuge alcohol, medium body, crisp carbonation. 

O: This is both very good and very, very young. It really needs a couple years, because this has way too much going on. Wow. I dont know how to rate it.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
1219,"2017-02-03",3.3,"UPDATED: FEB 4, 2017 Best before: 2021. Black. Medicinal herbs, cognac, sweetbooze aroma. More of that plus sweet plum cake and chocolate taste. Very very big. But much more drinkable than the helles or even original Samichlaus. Considering it?s 14%, the alcohol is really not as in your face as the others. Still a bit over the top and outrageous to top out so strong like this, but it tastes alright and isn?t as booze heavy as its brothers. With further sips it becomes too much. Share this with someone!","Budapest, HUNGARY","Cristobal37"
1219,"2017-01-22",3.4,"Bottle. Creamy lightbrown good mostly lasting head. Very dark red amber colour. Moderate malty and light hoppy very herbal aroma. Moderate biter and light sweet flavor. Long moderate bitter finish. Alas slightly alcoholic. Creamy palate.","Randers, DENMARK","HenrikSoegaard"
1219,"2017-01-07",3.8,"7 Jan 2016, bottle (bottled 2014). dark brown/black. nose is boozy and yeasty like all the others, but might have a little more dark malt and/or dark fruit. Full/med body and mildly fizzy and syrupy. this has much more molasses than the standard Samichlaus. Rich, brown sugar, boozy, mild molasses. I like this!","California, USA","Blairgus"
1219,"2016-12-26",4.0,"Bottle from ABV. Pours a wonderful ruby brown color with a small white head. A big sticky sweet nose, roast, smoke, toffee. The flavor is sweet cherries, heat, toffee, sugary, a sticky palate, rum. Really tastes hot and sweet but is somehow very drinkable. Dusty earthy malts, raisin, figs, smoke. Quite awesome.

1219,"2016-12-08",3.8,"330 ml bottle, vintage 2016, bb 09.2021
Dark brown body, with a small, creamy, beige head. 
Aroma of caramel, melting chocolate, cocoa, dried fruits, sherry, some toast. 
Tastes similar, with some more brown sugar and some booze, but not as much as expected. 
Medium, creamy mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation. 
Finishes alcohol warming, astringent, 

Very nice. Heavy and sweet, but really interesting and diverse, especially the nose, with lovely chocolatey notes. Alcohol isnt too overwhelming for the ABV. Overall a bit too sweet, maybe this will improve after some years of aging, but still a lovely sipper.","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"
1219,"2016-12-03",3.3,"33cl bottle. Bottled in 2014. Pours an opaque dark brown with a very fizzy head that lasted about 3 seconds and then disappeared completely. Aroma of sweet malt, stone fruit, caramel and fruit cake. Taste is very sweet malt, syrup, plum, raisins, fruit cake and alcohol. Almost no carbonation. Finish is extremely sweet with a sharp alcoholic bite. Nothing at all like a Schwarzbier. Advertised on the bottle as ""the worlds most extraordinary beverage."" I dont know about that, but it certainly is unique.","Texas, USA","wombat23"
1219,"2016-12-02",3.8,"Bottle from bhensonb. Pours near black with a modest tan head and a sweet malt and alcohol aroma. There is a sweet smoky dark molasses flavor with a warm alcohol trail.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
1219,"2016-11-29",4.0,"Bottle from Total Wine in Sacramento, CA. Pours dark brown with a slight tan head. Aroma is very dark treacle with hints of what could be rye and smoke. Full bodied or nearly. Its thick and treacly. Rye spice. Hint of smoke. It is far from dry, and the rye is the only offsetting feature. Very tasty tho. 14% helps a lot!","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1219,"2016-11-26",3.4,"Dark brown pour. Aroma of raisin, toffee, molasses, and hint of smoke. Very sweet flavor with molasses, toffee, raisin, and some smoke. Would be better if it werent so sweet.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","alobar"

Flavor is quite sweet, malty and rich, complex dark breads, toffee, molasses, hints of smoke. Full body, smooth mouthfeel. Lingering sweetness. This is a hugely complex sipper. Really nice alternative to an impy. ABV very well hidden, making this dangerous","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
1219,"2016-08-03",4.3,"330 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled in 2014. Pours lightly hazy very dark brown color with a 1 finger fairly dense khaki head with solid retention, that reduces to a thin spotty lace cap that lingers. Minimal lacing on the glass. Aromas of big chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, oak, toasted dark bread, spicy rye, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, light coffee/smoke/nutty, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of huge chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, oak, toasted dark bread, spicy rye, raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, light coffee/smoke/nutty, herbal, and roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/spicy hop and roast bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, cocoa, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, oak, toasted dark bread, spicy rye, dark fruit, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitter/sweet balance, and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from roast/hop bitterness as well. Light-medium carbonation and very full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly slick/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warmth lingering after the finish; with zero booziness. Overall this is an incredible doppelbock/schwarzbier style! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
1219,"2016-06-13",3.5,"Sample at WOBFest 2016. I honestly thought this was the exact same taste as the classic. Hence I rated it the same and my comments are the same:

I shoulda read that abv on this one. Got my a$$ kicked accidentally by the 14 pct. Pours extremely flat and has a liquor quality that makes it a true sipping beer. Almost has a quad-like flavor with some malt liquor.","","Cousin_Larry"
1219,"2016-04-18",4.0,"Caramel malt dried fruit and a oaky mossy smell. Deep dark red in color. Taste of sweet malts and ripe grape juice hides adv boozy flavor very well nice warming sensation. Its like weak sparkling grape juice with smooth Full body. Was frightened by the abv but if you can get your hans on one bomb brew. Nice work.","milton, Vermont, USA","polo_marco"
1219,"2016-01-31",3.8,"2014 vintage. Pours very dark brown, with a thinnish light cream head. Aroma of malt, alcohol and oak. Taste is slightly sweet, with a complex mouthfeel. Palate lingers, and you can feel the high abv. A very interesting Schwarze brew. Thumbs up.","Anaconda, Montana, USA","mbgrayson"
1219,"2016-01-09",3.8,"Aroma - their is a fair amount of honey, molasses, and alcohol.
Appearance - body is a clean cola color. The head is about 3/4"" and off-white. The head rings out quickly. Alcohol cloys the glass.
Taste - Whoa! There is generous alcohol, sweet malt ~ with some honey/molasses like nature, some nuttiness, and even a bit of smoke.
Palate - body is approaching full, the texture slick and sticky, the carbonation soft, and the finish has a fair amount of alcohol.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"
1219,"2016-01-07",3.9,"old notes I think around end of november 2014. 0,33l bottle shared with some people. dark brown, almost black color, very small tan colored head. smells of black currants, rather subtle smell, light earth note, quite alcoholic smell. had this at the same time as some other Samichlauses and in comparison the smell is a lot less complex (could have to do with age though). full body, light carbonation, oily mouthfeel. basically the same notes as the smell, quite sweet, quite (warming) alcoholic, some liqueur, subtle smoke. great beer.","Vienna, AUSTRIA","Werckmeister"
1219,"2016-01-06",4.0,"Bottle from the COOP, paid about $6... Surprised to see it on the floor, there cant be that many people picking it up. Poured into my FW goblet, tannish head rises up and dies back very quickly.. the brew is deeeeep walnut, still clear but it is daaarrrk.

The nose smells like, ""go to your cupboard and grab the box of raisins... stuff your nose in it and breathe deeply."" Not getting much anything that would put this into the ""blackbier"" category.. tons of melanoidin malt..

Thick and rich maltiness... deep caramel but never gets absurdly sweet.. No cloying sugary notes, just sweet maltiness... You must make the difference with this one.. Deep malty is very different than sweet.. Very rich and still forgiving.

Thick on the palate with no questions.. Samichlaus has moved on beyond the normal boundaries... I still dig this one better than the Helles.","Boise, Idaho, USA","JohnGalt1"
1219,"2016-01-06",4.3,"Black but not pitch black, small head of tan foam, a bit of lacing from this 2014 bottle. 

Roasted malt, caramel malt, fruity of the dark kind, boozy. I like. 

Semi sweet from the caramel and dark pitted fruit. Hints of oxidation in a good way. Dry and boozy finish. Actually boozy throughout but the body and taste of the beer seems to take the edge off to a degree. 

Full bodied with light carbonation. 

This may be my favourite Samichlaus ever! Too bad it is not brewed anymore.

This is the same as their Classic? ?","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"
