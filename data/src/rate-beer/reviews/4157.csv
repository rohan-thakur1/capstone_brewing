4157,"2014-03-30",4.0,"From a ceramic bottle. 
Pours still, a deep reddish amber color with a light haze to it. 

The aroma is pretty honey forward from the get go, but rich boozy and oaky notes emerge as it opens up. The fruitiness is really very subtle, you dont miss the raspberry because you know its supposed to be there... but I wonder if blindfolded if I would even recognize the particular fruit used in this mead, not really a bad or good thing.... just interesting. 

The raspberry character is far more present in the flavor adding fruitiness & tartness to the big sweet honey flavor of the mead. Its really more akin to a liqueur than say Jadwiga in as much as the alcohol is far more present and warming in this one than in that Mead. The oakiness is also very nice albeit subtle. 

I like this, very much... Im not sure I like it enough to go grab another $40 bottle of it anytime soon... but it is complex & enjoyable and was worth trying at least once.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
4157,"2013-10-01",4.3,"0.1l ceramic bottle from trade with Eldesmadre. This is near clear in the glass, kind of brown copper or even bronze - red color and it had lots of tiny mind blurring eye floaters. Smells amazing. It just does. I get lots of sour raspberries and wood. The honey sweetness actually really kicks you in the teeth, but it somehow still manages mo feels gentle. Even if it comes almost straight from the fridge it has a warming aura. It physically feels warm on the nose. A lovely strong and nose-cleaning aroma. Lots of raspberries in the flavor also! Oh, my. Ive never tasted something as intense concentrated and fruity all in once before. You can just hear the teeths rotten from all that wonderful sweet honey.

4157,"2010-06-14",4.0,"Aroma is very alcoholic and sharp raspberry with a heavy dose of sweet honey.  As it opens up more the alcohol dissipates and leaves a sweet, honey-drenched raspberry aroma that is quite appealing.
Taste is initially straight honey, but the raspberry slices through the sweetness to add a fruity tang to the mixture.  Alcohol makes itself known, but does not overly intrude.  A bit of burnt plastic and oranges are apparent, but not overly prevalent.
Finish is of raspberry seed, orange extract, and honey with an alcoholic backbone.
