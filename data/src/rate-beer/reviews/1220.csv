1220,"2015-12-12",3.3,"Bottle shared by Derek - thanks!! Murky brown pour with a slight head. Nose is a bit odd - a hint of smoke, some fruit. Low carbonation, dark Belgian stuff with a smooth boozy finish.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"

1220,"2015-12-12",3.8,"Bottle. Pours a near clear dark amber brown with a grayish brown head that dissipates to the edges. Aroma has a good amount of bourbon with dark grains and a bit of sweetness. Flavor has a nice bourbon and sweet grain combination with a bit of molasses underlying.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1220,"2015-03-04",3.3,"Tap: Looks like muddy swamp water, deep shitty brown color with a light-tan collar around the top. Caramel coated plums, oak, light apple, toffee, wood, brown sugar, & a strong waft of bourbon that lingers with a little warmth in the back of the throat. Sticky dark malts, light roast, raisins, & maybe just a touch of vanilla. Dark fruit & woody finish. Nice.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
1220,"2014-12-14",3.8,"Pour on tap at the brewery, muddy brownish pour with thin to no head, aroma brought notes of dark fruit, cocoa, hints of nuts, touch of bourbon, vanilla, touch of oak, sweet caramel and molasses notes as well. Taste was a mix of sweet bourbon, oak, vanilla, hints of earth, spice, some nice dark fruits, molasses, and toffee, finishing fairly sweet.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
1220,"2014-12-06",3.7,"Draft to taster at The Livery. Looks good; a slightly translucent chewy dark brown with very thin off-white lacing. Smells solid; bourbon, oak, and caramel with a light lager yeast presence. Tastes like it smells with some plum as well. Pleasant on the palate with very soft carbonation that airs well with the body. Good beer.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
1220,"2011-01-11",3.6,"Enjoyed on the bus to Bells during RBSG.  Deep amber pour with a sticky white head.  The nose is lightly fruity.  A sort of salty character along with a lot of bourbon on the nose along with some nice oaky contribution.  Toasted oak, light vanilla and a little bit of lightly lactic tartness.  A touch of dark funkiness going on as well as a bit of the light fruit.  Pretty nice stuff although its hardly doppelbock anymore.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1220,"2010-04-15",3.5,"750 ml bottle; wow, thanks Brandon!! Pours dense brown with slight tan head; musky aromas of wheat, dry chocolate and figs; a very sweet mix of bourbon, wheat, vanilla and oats; almost a sour note pops up in the finish; combo of flavors is not my thin and seems a little off","Seattle, Washington, USA","SuzyGreenberg"
1220,"2010-03-25",3.8,"750 ml bottle shared by Tmoney99.  Pours a hazy orange brown color with a small tan head.  The aroma is sweet caramel malts, ripe fruits, cherries, and oak barrels.  The flavor has caramel sweetness, ripe fruits, a slight tartness, cherry vanilla and bourbon.  Medium bodied, which seemed a bit thin for the beer.  Otherwise a nice barrel aged dopplebock.

Rating #35 for this beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
1220,"2009-10-17",3.6,"750ml capped from hoppymeal.  Pours a deep cola brown with some tan head.  Malty nose with brown sugar, cola, prune, a just a bit of burbon...okay more than a bit.  Kind of tart and smokey, wood, cherry pits, tobacco.  The over powering barrel on the nose and slight twang take away a bit from this, but still interesting non the less.  Thanks Derek!","Washington, USA","bvc"
1220,"2009-10-17",3.2,"750, capped. cool square shouldered belgian bottle with a cap. pours cloudy dark brown with garnet highlights and a loose tan head. outrageously bourbony nose. definitely too much & out of balance. creamy medium body, kinda flat. roasty toasty malt underneath a bourbon tsunami on the mid palate. tasty but lopsided.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
1220,"2009-09-14",3.9,"Metro Tasting.  Poured a cloudy orange color.  Aroma was slightly tart, earthy hops and a bit of bourbon.  Taste is much the same, yeast, lightly tart, light sweet malt.  Tasty stuff.","Holt, Michigan, USA","masonjer"
1220,"2009-09-09",3.4,"Bottle... Pitch black lager with a small, creamy, white head. Smoky, chocolaty aroma also offers less significant notes of wood and bourbon. Medium-bodied and a touch astringent with jovial carbonation. The flavor pulls a lot of acidity, tannins and bourbon from the barrel, but the caramel malt is left intact and flows underneath the radar throughout both the flavor and finish. Earthy, woody and tangy in the end. GoT thinks its mack. Word. Thanks to that crazy SOB for sharing the bottle!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1220,"2009-09-08",4.1,"Shared by GoT. Nicy oaky tannins with caramel malt beneath. Somewhat of an acidic finish. Alot of barrel character, not alot of doppelbock character, but its very good!","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

1220,"2009-06-06",3.6,"750mL Bottle. Bourbon and candy strong in the nose. Soft and warm. Pours a dark sienna brown with a little rim of whitish. Bring on the acetic, this has fresh apple cider written all over it. A bit of pale caramel. Tangy, but acidic. Kind of bland.  A somewhat classic bock gone acid. A little peculiar and strange. Thanks Sean!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1220,"2009-04-20",4.1,"No doubt the highlight of our visit. Distinct,almost sharp whiskey aroma,but not so dominant that the rich dark caramel,molassas doesnt come through, taste is again a slap of lively full force bourbon,with is wonderfully backed by very evident rich dark malt,certainly some sweetness there,and a quality whiskey finish. Obviously some excellent barrels used here,should improve with age","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"
1220,"2009-03-06",3.8,"Tap at The Livery - this opaque brew pours oil black with very little head. Tons of bourbon on the nose, which leads right into the taste, which is all bourbon right away. It mellows into raisins, dark fruit, and sweet malt. Theres a pleasant buttery taste in there as well. Thin mouthfeel is a little unexpected for a beer this big. The bourbon was dialed up a little too much, but still a tasty beer.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
1220,"2009-03-04",4.0,"Draft sample at 2009 MBG Winterfest.

Poured dark reddish brown with a moderate light brown head that diminished slowly with good lacing.  Good caramel toasted tart fruit and b ourbon barrel aroma.

1220,"2008-02-08",3.5,"tap at brewery......poured a slightly darker than caramel broan witha frothy film of an ivory head....an abundance of dark fruit, caramel, and sweet malt with little signs of being aged in the barrel....flavors followed suit.  much of the same aroma qualities can be found here. a very subtle tint of bourbon comes through but very little.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
1220,"2008-02-07",3.6,"22 oz hand bottled bomber courtesy of BBB63.  Pours a semi clear dark mahogany with no head.  Aroma of cola, light malts and a hint of bourbon.  Taste is slightly sweet and malty with a hint of vanilla cola and bourbon.  Not bad.","Doylestown, PA, USA","adrian910ss"
1220,"2008-01-16",3.8,"Hand-bottled and acquired in trade. I wasnt anticipating all the sediment as I poured it into the snifter. The color is a murky brown with no head. Im guessing it will be completely flat. The aroma is sweet malts and a nice smokiness that is pretty enticing. The first mouthful matched the smells. The smokiness matches nicely with the sweet fruity malts. Well done. Its a shame its flat, although that didnt hurt it much.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","shadey"
1220,"2008-01-06",3.9,"Thanks Mike for sharing this 2007 vintage growler.  The beer pours to a deep brown body with a thin off-white head.  The aroma is fruity deep caramelized malts, with lots of molasses and caramel.  The flavor is rich and caramelized, really sweet, and has nice notes of vanilla amongst the rich malts.  Im digging this!  The beer has a rich caramelized palate.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
1220,"2007-12-28",3.9,"Sampled via growler during Cheesehead YeHA in Brookfield, Wisconsin and shared by BBB63. Pours a hazy dark brown brew with a fast dissolving tan head that quickly dissipates to a fine film and a thin tan ring. Aroma of dark roasted caramel malt, some fruity character, vanilla and some bourbon. Taste is medium to full bodied, very light carbonation with flavors of caramel malt, some dark pitted fruits, bourbon and a touch of vanilla. Finish has a high alcohol warmth with a bourbonized caramel aftertaste flavor. Nice!","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
1220,"2007-12-17",3.5,"Thanks to Mike for bringing the growler!  Poured clear deeper brown with just a little yellowy-beige head.  The aroma picked up sweet bourbon and vanilla over drawn caramel upfront.. a bit sour and a bit smoky.. a little too much simple sugar going on.. enjoyed the closing impression of bourbon and vanilla as well.  The flavor had warm caramel and chocolate (more caramel) with nice bourbon and vanilla accents.. warm, rather dry finish.. good use of lightly-smoked caramel and well-balanced.  Syrupy on the palate with lower carbonation.. some sourness from the bourbon and oak at the edges.. warm at the end with a bit of alcohol bite.  Solid stuff!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1220,"2007-12-16",4.0,"Dark black pour nice tan head, good lacing.  Light bourbon aroma some butters and a touch of vanilla, some alcohols are quite prevelant but not bad a light wheat like grainy aroma over a touch of roastiness.  Palate is full and well coated, lightly creamy.  Flavor is delicious huge sweet tastes, definately a wheat beer, great bourbon that doesnt dominate w/ some light vanillas.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
1220,"2007-11-18",3.7,"On tap at the 2007 GTMW: Pours a transparent dark mahogany with a well-lacing dark tan head.  Aroma of sweet caramel and light fruits with a touch of bourbon oak.  Starts with a light tartness and dark caramely sweetness along with sweet and tart dark maltiness with some black cherries and vanilla.  A pretty good barrel-aged doppelbock.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

1220,"2007-09-07",3.7,"On tap at the Livery. This black ale poured with a miniscule beige head. There is a really nice roasted malt flavor with a mellow bourbon finish. This one was good to the last drop.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
1220,"2007-08-27",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2007 Draft @ the Brewery.  Dark brown with a small head.  Aroma has a large helping of bourbon/wood with a hefty sweetness that comes from big roasty malts, dark fruits and vanilla.  Flavor has lots of boutbon and wood, vanilla, oak, plumb, brown sugar, and other sweet flavors.  Tasty, but the taste couldnt quite live up to what I was hoping for.  Still a great beer.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
1220,"2007-08-26",4.0,"On tap at The Livery, and served in a snifter.  This beer poured a dark brown color with a very thin, light brown/gray head that left no lace.  The aroma of the brew consisted of bourbon, light caramel, dark fruits, and some light alcoholic notes.  The flavor was stong bourbon, dark fruit, wood, vanilla, with some warming alcohol showing up at the finish.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied and slightly oily with a very minimal amount of carbonation.  This was one exceptional beer.  Dont pass it up if you have the opportunity to try it.","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"
1220,"2007-08-17",3.8,"Tap @ GTMW. Mildly translucent and murky chocolate brown in color with a creamy tanish foam wrung for the head. Aroma livens with bourbon stained coasters and pool floaties. A hint of plastic sealant on the barrel and a subdued cocoa chocolate dust reach the olfactory as well. Flavor is naturally full and true to the base beer. Sodden grahams get lined with chocolate nutella paste. Hazelnut shards line several inches of caramelized toffee bricks. Active carbonation reams in the cocoa oat bread and maple infused whole wheat cubes. A touch of spicy scotch traits come through in common complimentary power to the fuller bodied basis of the beer. The barrel is complimented by a golden honey coating over maple oat brown bread in the finish.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
1220,"2007-08-14",4.0,"GTMW. A pleasure to sample this one as Ive been a fan of Livery since they first appeared on the scene at the Great Taste in 2005. Enjoyed this one just before their casked aged IPA. Notes of bread, clove, cherry, black plum, and vanilla on a rich palate. Bourbon complements the characteristics of the doppelbock well. This may not be quite up to the standards of the Weizenbock on bourbon, but it sure is a great ride. Nice work, Steve!","Illinois, USA","Philip"
1220,"2007-08-08",3.8,"On tap:  Big caramel, vanilla, bourbon, and oak aroma.  Its a dark cloudy brown with a large tan head with great retention.  Teh flavor has fruit, raisin, plum, and caramel.  There is some light oak in the background.  The finish has light bourbon with some fruity tanginess.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
1220,"2007-08-01",3.8,"MI Summer Beer Fest.   Pours brown in color with a thin head of light creamy bubbles.   Aroma is sweet and malty with some dark fruit.   Flavor is dark fruit, chocolate, grain, and toast.   Palate is medium bodied, mildly carbonated, finishes sweet.   Smooth and rather easy to drink.  Solid.","Ohio, USA","ogglethorp"
1220,"2007-07-29",4.4,"On tap, both at brewery and Michigan brewers guild fest.  Dark brown like a light stout or dark porter with a thin to almost no tan head.  Much more in the mold of a Celebrator Doppelbock, than the more common sweet bock style, in aroma as well as appearance.  Fruity dark malt character (prunes, etc.) some roast is present, but no off-aromas.  Prunes, plum and a nice vanilla to oaky bourbon subtlety.  I cannot believe how well the bourbon integrates with the rest of this beer.  Somehow, Steve has made this capture the vanilla above and beyond any other aspect of the bourbon, and it works perfectly with this style of doppelbock (especially when that doppelbock seems like a humdinger as well!).  Light low carbonation, which feels appropriate.  Not super thick, but certainly not watery in any way.  Fruity with a nice little range of esters.  Dark malt character in the back.  A dry lingering bourbon vanilla subtlety.  Dry prunes linger.  I cant say Ive ever seen a more judicious use of a bourbon barrel.  I have to agree with the brewer, Steve, this is even better than the bourbon barrel aged trippel weizen bock!  If this were bottled, Id drink this at least every other week, and I seldom have the same thing twice a month.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"
1220,"2007-07-04",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2007 Tap at brewery: Very deep brown with minimal head but had some oily legs. The nose detected noticeable bourbon and vanilla vapours along with prune, anise, toffee, dark bread, and classic German hops. The taste first develops a rich toffee malt character with a bread background. There are heavy bourbon notes on the finish and is surprisingly dry and mostly clean which kept the beer balance in check. The mouth feel is medium weight, biting and slightly warming. Yet another wonderful brew by Steve. I will be going back for a growler or three.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
