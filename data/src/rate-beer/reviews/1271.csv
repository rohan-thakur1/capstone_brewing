Has a slight hint of tartness in the background. Yes, turning out to be a pretty good example of esb. One of the better esbs I think Ive had in a while. Surprizingly good co2 effect, even on cask!","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"
1271,"2014-06-12",4.2,"Heck yeah. Nice ESB. Biscuity, malty, good head retention. Little on the hoppier side of the ESB equation. Got some sweetness to it I wasn't expecting. Great beer.

1271,"2012-03-31",2.8,"From a bomber, said best before Nov.  But what year?  Bought in Mar. 2012.  Bottle opened releasing great pressure, but foamed like crazy when poured into clean glass.  I ended up with 1"" of beer and 6"" of foam.  I suspect this bottle was well past, which is a shame as I was looking forward to tasting a top rated Bitter, as I like the style.  Very bitter in the nose and extremely bitter in the finish.  Carbonation was very lively in the mouth as well.  Tasted like an over the top hopped IPA.  Head retention and lacing was the most I have ever seen.  Maybe my opinion will improve if I ever get to taste a fresh one.","New Jersey, USA","Gaspasser"

1271,"2011-08-05",3.0,"Location: 22 oz bottle from Buy Rite, 8/5/11


Aroma: The nose has some grassy and floral hops, and some caramel too

Appearance: It pours a mostly clear dark orange-brown color with a creamy beige head

Palate: The body is medium, with a somewhat sticky mouthfeel, and a tingly/lively carbonation

Overall Impression: 
Overall, I wanted to like this one more then I actually did.  The taste just had something off about it, like an unintended sourness.  I dont know if it was a bad bottle, or just not a great beer, but it wound up disappointing me just a little.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Flavor opens up very bitter for an ESB and exhibits a juicy hop character with a straight bitter finish. As it warms, the sweet malt catches up and actually overtakes the bitter aspects by the end, even going a bit too sweet for me beyond the lovely toastedness I felt in the aroma.

1271,"2008-08-10",3.5,"In short: A yeasty messy hoppy beer.  Surprisingly interesting mess.
How:  Bottle 22oz, drank the day of purchase (therefore most likely very fresh)
The look: Cloudy orange body topped by a medium off-white head
In long: Nose is floral and citrus.  Mouthfeel is like a pillow.  Definitely very yeasty, a lot more than a normal ESB.  This is a fluffy beer with citrus, wood juice, dry tree leaves, a little farmhouse thing, a few dried apricots, and some other stuff.  The beer is actually quite messy and unfocussed.  Feels like a amateurish lucky shot.  The antithesis of the clean crisp beer.  Whatever, when very fresh this is a surprisingly good mess.

1271,"2007-05-31",3.4,"So I bought this knowing it was past its prime, because the last Mcneills brew I had past its prime was pretty freakin good (God bless the funk!) - the cap less popped off than it did tear off, leaving some interesting crud around the lip of the bottle (oh yea!) - cloudy orange pour, with small ring of lace - aroma of biscuity british malt, highly floral hops, apricot, and some slight musty, earthy, almost barnyardy qualities (theres some of that funk starting to form in this one) - citrusy palate up front, but a lot of the malt flavor seems to have become stale, making room for some oxidation and a tiny bit of sourness that combines well with the hop bitterness and herbal flavors - apricots and peaches arrive late - lingering hops - fresh this is probably awesome, and with a little more time in the bottle to let those micro-organisms work their magic will probably make it awesome in a different way - for now its just pretty good.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

I feel like the hops overshadowed everything else in this beer and totally dominate the finish.  This was good, but more body and a little balance would go a long way to making it awesome.","New York, USA","Steak"

1271,"2001-11-21",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2004 It could be better.  It failed to impress me when I drank it at first. As I got deeper into the bottle I liked it more. Super malty and good.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"

1271,"2001-07-25",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2003 July 2001: Solid, solid bitter.  Perhaps not as well balanced (not quite as sweet, bit too hoppy) as Vermont Pub, but still a nice example of the style.  Beautiful tawny color and grapefruit nose are highlights.

February 2003:  more pleased with the intense hoppiness this time perhaps; citrusy nature really comes through along with a pleasant pineyness and if you take a large mouthful you get some nice caramel as well.  Great mouthfeel, and though I keep trying to find fault with McNeills instead I find myself rerating them higher.  A true classic.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1271,"2001-06-14",3.9,"An all around decent bitter. Im using this comment box to plug their Ruby Ale. Im from Vermont, and believe me, McNeils Ruby Ale is the best beer ever made in the state. One of the best beers Ive EVER had.  A true knockout. Why the brewer decided to make the Ruby Ale a only few months out of the year is baffling.  If you, beer drinker, ever have a chance to get this beer, do it. You will not be disappointed.  It would get a 19 rating.","Rutland, Vermont, USA","canary dog"
