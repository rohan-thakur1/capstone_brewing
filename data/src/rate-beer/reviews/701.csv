701,"2016-04-16",4.0,"750 ml bottle, 2011 vintage. Served in a thistle glass, the beer pours a dark brown/ruby red color with about a half inch tan head. Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is sweet and malty, the brew smells like bourbon, vanilla, dark berries, caramel and molasses. For the most part the taste is just like the aroma, but theres also some plum, nuts and woodiness noticeable. Tasted better as it warmed up (and I had already let it sit for about 20 minutes out of the fridge before opening it). Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit slick and syrupy and is easy enough to drink. Moderate carbonation. I thought this was an enjoyable brew, definitely worth a try if youve never had it before. $21.99 a bottle.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

701,"2013-10-20",3.9,"Rated on 01-09-2009 at Fort Wayne, IN Winter Gathering (Bottle courtesy of patrick767) This beer pours a very small tan head with good retention, opaque reddish brown body, and no lacing. The Aroma is buttery, bourbon, vanilla, and a hint of dark fruit. The Taste is vanilla, malty, bourbon, and the ABV is very noticeable, but in a good way. This beer is medium bodied. Overall, this beer is very quaffable and the bourbon dominates the Aroma and Taste. This beer is very tasty, worth trying and a beer that I would drink again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
701,"2013-08-25",2.3,"In short: A cloying muddy bourbonny Scotch Ale with no redeeming quality. 
How: Bottle 750ml, not sure about the age, consumed approximately 9 months after receiving it from Bobby91w, thanks Bobby.
The look: Muddy brown body with almost no head.
In long: Nose is heavy on the bourbon barrels, big buttery toffee swimming in vanilla. A deep heavy aroma with no brightness, not inviting. In mouth the beer feels sticky syrupy and with minimal carbonation, a lifeless mouthfeel. Taste is bourbon soaked oak, heavy toffee, buttery caramel, vanilla extract, booze, even some awkward pickles notes. Cloying, one-dimensional, no body richness, a complete lack of brightness, nothing good here. In the words of Forest Gump, some breweries are unpredictable and drinking their beers is like a box of chocolate and you never know what youre gonna get next, but drinking Shoreline is like a box of chocolate that your controlling mother replaced each chocolate with a healthy fruit, just one disappointment after another.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Again, the bourbon hits up front in the taste with some underlying vanilla from the barrel.  The base scotch ale is present if not dominant with caramel malts and smoke.  Maybe some molasses and dark fruits as well.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and the bourbon makes it a bit slick with a soft carbonation.
