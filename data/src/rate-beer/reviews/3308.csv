Amazingly ""wild"" nose, bretty pollen, daffodil and dandelion flowers on a summery meadow - near-saison like (Saison de Cazeau) - fascinating. At the same time some rubbery smoked notes, near-medicinal like an Islay whiskey - must be that coolship? Lots of confidently bitter milk thistle notes (Saison Dupont), hints of smoked rubber on thick, honey-drizzled pilsner malts. - 2nd batch, post onstorm 04/10/2015 had much less of this wild profile and shows how much batches can differ even at the same Zoiglwirt. Common theme: bitter noble hops (melissa, nettle, thistle milk, dandelion) meet dry vegetable oil, honeylike palate. The most captivating and memorable of all W-Bach and Neuhäuser Zoigls this weekend.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"
3308,"2015-05-26",3.7,"Vom Faß beim Bahler, 19.5.2015. - Goldgelb mit leichtem Orangeton, schwach trüb. - Leichter (noch angenehmer) Geruch nach Bauernhof (Kuhstall), dazu etwas Orange und Gras. - Antrunk sehr mild, zunächst fast dünn; schwach malzig mit einem Hauch von Karamel. Im weiteren Verlauf bittert es unerwartet stark nach mit nicht allzu kräftigem aber aromatischem Hopfen: Orangenschale, Gras, etwas Pfeffer. Schwach rezent, schlank und leicht mineralisch, dadurch enorm süffig: man könnte stundenlang weitertrinken. Schön bitterer Nachtrunk mit Pfeffer. - Sehr schöner Zoigl: schwach gespundet, anfangs mild, dann aber von aromatischer Bittere. Unglaublich süffig.","Beijing, CHINA","Moravius"

3308,"2009-10-19",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 6, 2014 October 2009: the first and last zoigl of the night. first impressions were a bit wonky as they had just begun pouring and the carbonation and body seemed  flabby and lifeless. but later that night its conditioned had changed remarkably and it was ""on"". appearance was hazy golden wheat with a rocky and soft fine-bubbled white head. nose is malt/grain-rich with spiced / rustic honey, apples, butter and hay, with snappy malt and a minerally and zesty yeast quality. amazingly fresh and vibrant, exceptionally deep and complex, and immeasurably drinkable. froth and rich texture, perfectly mashed, perfectly structured. i drank a lot of this later during the night.

August 2014:  We wedding crashed Zoiglstube Bahler on a Saturday night, sneaking inside to taste a small glass and being told to sit outside next to the wedding guests where they poured us a small glass of the Zoiglbier.  Unfortunately it was in terrible shape.  Strong diacetyl, lots of sugar, flabby mouth feel. Boo on this.  (2.4)","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

3308,"2006-12-16",3.7,"Draught, at Beim Bahler in Neuhaus, October 2006. Faintly hazy gold, moderate thin white head and gentle condition. Restrained sweet malt and dominant peppery hoppiness in the aroma, pleasantly yeasty-sweet in the mouth with a developing caramel note and a building but restrained hop bitterness. Long dry and bitter finish that comes both from the hops and the yeastiness. Much drier and hoppier than the Zoigl across the river in Windischeschenbach.

3308,"2006-11-20",3.3,"Bottle. Pale Yellow. This was quite a ncie lager. Bready/doughy malt notes, with a slightly sticky mouthfeel, which is balanced by some grassy hop bitterness in the finish. The bitterness is quite soft and makes the beer quite more-ish. A pleasant lager!","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"

3308,"2006-09-18",3.4,"LCRBM2. Bottle from Derdoppelbock. I always find the first beer of a tasting difficult, because you dont want to start too high or too low as you then guage everything off that benchmark. But I did rather like this. Golden with thin white head.  Pale malt aroma, bit dusty, some sticvky toffee in mouth, and then dry, tangy finish. Nice, interesting.  Good lasting tangy finish, if a little uncultured.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

Sweet initially, but with a very fine hoppy lining, especially coming up in the finish. Light, but grist slickness, refreshing. This is UNBELIEVABLE!
