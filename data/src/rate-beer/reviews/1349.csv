1349,"2015-03-20",3.4,"Kind of like a dark aber or red. Not real malty as I would think. Lean on body, easy drinking beer but nothing to it as a Scottish should. .","San Marcos, California, USA","IPagan5"
1349,"2012-02-22",2.7,"Muddy orange, hoppy, dry, bitter, plain. I wish I had more to say about this beer, but it just fell flat for me.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"
1349,"2012-02-21",3.2,"Draft.  Hazy brown color, large bubble white head.  Aroma of subtle white bread.  Taste is rising sourdough bread, caramel, light spice.  Nice.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
1349,"2012-01-11",3.7,"Hazy, reddish-amber.  Lots of earthy, chocolatey, caramelly malts and woody, dry American hops.  Sweetish, light caramel and chocolate, but with lots of woody hops again.  Quite a bit of bitterness.  Not Scottish in any way, but a good brew.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1349,"2012-01-10",3.4,"Clear amber color/ ivory head. Spicy caramel, floral, fruity hop aromas. medium bodied. Mild floral, fruity hop flavors with spicy sweet caramel--good","Same Trailer, Different Park, Louisiana, USA","AmEricanbrew"
1349,"2012-01-06",3.7,"Draft @ brewpub. Gorgeous lace! Dark red. Sweetish, brown cakey malts and raisin bread. Balanced by the ""I cant help myself!"" hops. and alcoholic heat. Alcohol coming out a little too much! Unfortunately. But the hops are powerful. A slow sip allows for a careful study of the beer, which starts with the raisin flavor but that is quickly overshadowed by the hops. Seriously not a Scottish ale, the hops are out of control, but as a seattle parody of a Scottish it works fine. Dates. Ultimately the hops win the battle, although the malts Put up a good fight at first. Wont be winning awards in its category tho! Very interesting even if more like a hoppy brown","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
1349,"2009-01-17",4.2,"Ruddy amber color, clingy head. Big nose with grassy and piny aromas. Crisp texture ontop a medium malt body. Big hop taste in the middle and end, lingering peppery character. Just a little heavier than an IIPA, but not quite as heavy as something like Bigfoot.","GERMANY","pivo"
1349,"2009-01-12",3.7,"Seattle-Draft, Nov. 2008: Nice golden amber color. Medium lacey head. Nice hoppy nose - some grass in there too. Medium hoppy taste- not bitter. Vanishes soon with a short after kick. really nice.","New Jersey, USA","YogiBeera"
1349,"2009-01-10",3.6,"Draft at Tangletown. Pours a crystal clear rubied garnet. Should have known right away with would not be a typical scottish. Big sudsy light tan head up top. You almost expect to see flecks of milled grain in it, cause it looks so much liek bread dough. Big sticky sweet smelling nose, lots of caramel and brown bread, with some floral and light piney hops poking through. Creamy medium body. Its not quite literally sticky, but, man, is it close. What a malt monster. Brown bread, caramel, maybe a little bit of honey underneath a truly notably hopped flavor profile; theres earth, some peppery pine, and a nice little resiny bite at the end. The malt bill needs some serious diversification if this beer is to attain greatness, though. Its a great concept, but right now its a super-hopped sticky-sweet brown ale. It needs more peat, smoke, molasses, maybe some leafy bite to the malt. Maybe some roast. I dont know, but some differentiation has to be there. Still, the pint was easy to put down with gusto. Seeing such obvious room for improvement with simple changes (who doesnt love buffing out a specialty grain bill?) bodes well for the future.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
1349,"2008-10-18",3.6,"For me this was a nice scotch with not much smoke and moderate bitterness. Very nice smooth malt sweetness. Some wood almost enhances the richness.","Kingston, New York, USA","yobdoog"
1349,"2008-08-20",3.9,"Guest beer on draught at the 1221 E. Pike Street brewery in Seattle, Washington. Pours a semi-clear copper amber brew with a creamy off-whtie head that has some nice retention and good lacing. Aroma of multi-grain malt, some citrus zest and a touch of raisin. Taste is full bodied, light carbonation with a very malty multi-grain flavor that has a nice smooth texture. Finish retains the malty flavor with a mild bitter aftertaste that slowly disappears. One of the better Scottish Ales I’ve tried.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
1349,"2008-07-30",3.5,"Draught @ Elysian Fields. Pours a dark brown color with a longlasting off-white head. Roasted malty caramel aroma with some weak hints of hops. Roasted malty caramel flavor with some hoppy hints. Roasted malty hoppy finish with a long bitter aftertaste.","Malmö, SWEDEN","anders37"
1349,"2008-07-01",3.7,"Opaque brown,small lasting tan head.Light sweet nose,light sweet brown sugar profile,lightly roasted.Complex medium hop & roasty bitternness with a long lasting finish. Effervescent, good lacing","Surrey, British Columbia, CANADA","Crit"
1349,"2008-06-29",3.3,"Tap at Blind Tiger.  Deep amber-brown garnet-tinted beer.  Aroma is okay.  Fairly sweet and toasty with a hint of stewed prunes.  The flavour is pretty hoppy with a lightly spicy/earthy character.  Slightly sticky and chewy.  There is a kiss of vanilla/oakiness but I dont think its actually spent any time in oak.  A very atypical, but pretty decent scottish ale.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1349,"2008-06-22",3.6,"UPDATED: JUL 27, 2008 dark brown and creamy. oats and hops aroma with a taste of noticeable hops.","Seattle, Washington, USA","carruthm"
1349,"2008-06-18",3.3,"Nice scotch color with firm filmy, frothy head. Nice-looking beer. Enjoyable malt aroma typical of a scottish ale with some woodiness to it. Similarly malty flavor, medium-bodied with a woody twang. Solid Scottish ale that is highly quaffable, though a bit more hoppy than is typical of the style.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
1349,"2008-06-13",3.5,"Draft at brewpub.  Brown with a nice off white head. Aroma is carmel, nice maltiness slight alcohol sweetness.  Taste is malty, brown sugar, some hoppiness to it.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Enniskillen"
1349,"2006-10-07",3.5,"One of the better beers Ive had from Elysian in a while...definitely plenty of hop flavor for a Scottish Ale. Worth trying.","Seattle, Washington, USA","glkaiser"
