4283,"2013-10-30",3.8,"Clean, fresh aroma with a crystal clear light yellow color. Smooth malty taste with a clean finish. Perfect post-workout thirst quencher.","Virginia, USA","nasmith003"
4283,"2011-03-28",3.6,"Shared by Alex on a Friday night tasting...Pours a bright neon yellow, definetly highlighted by the clear east end growler that it is in. Pours with a suprising amount of carbonation for a growler, very good retention...The aroma is super hoppy, you can really tell it was dry hopped, maybe a tab bit too much hops. Almost smells like a true pilsner and I get a distinct hint of marjiuania on the finish....The taste is too hoppy for me and has a weird bite to it, I guess thats from the dryhopped and cask combo. Has some lemon to it... A pretty crisp drinker. An interesting combo here, worth trying but probably wouldnt drink this very often.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
4283,"2011-01-27",3.8,"Pours a hazy golden with a smaller white head.  Aroma of cheerios, light grains and noble hops.  Flavor the same...really well done.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
4283,"2010-07-11",2.9,"Sample at the brewery.  Golden hue with a sweet malty taste while hops provide some balance. Light slightly crisp body.  Clean finish consist of mostly biscuit malt with hops kick in at the end.  Couple more IBUs and this would be an excellent helles.",", New Jersey, USA","mike67"
4283,"2010-05-12",3.0,"On tap at Half Time.  Pours a just clear gold with a medium sized white head.  Light crackers and grain, touches of caramel.  Medium bodied, sweet and grainy.  Sweet crackers on the finish with a light bitterness and  a bit more grain.  Meh.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
4283,"2009-04-01",3.6,"Draft.  Pours a golden body with a white head.  Some wheat, grain, citrus, some floral notes, and low alcohol and a thin body.  Not bad.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
4283,"2009-02-25",3.7,"Draft at Craft Ale House.  Pours turbid gold with off-white head.  Nose is pale malt, citrus, wheat, and hops.  Tastes citric, hoppy, with solid pale malt in the bill, plus some finishing sweetness and florals.  Decent complexity makes this one a solid offering.  Ramstein has never, ever let me down.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
4283,"2007-04-11",3.0,"on tap-pours a white head and yellow color with effervescence.  Aroma is sweet grain, wheat, secondary light hops.  Taste is sweet grain, musty wheat, secondary light halletaur hops.  OK carbonation.","Florida and, New Jersey, USA","jcwattsrugger"
4283,"2007-03-24",3.9,"sampled on tap at the brewery.  Clear golden with a big white head.  Aroma is grainy and lightly herbal.  Taste is alot of pilsner malt, light cereal grains and a light amount of bitterness.  Very smooth, a flawless low alcohol lager.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
4283,"2007-03-21",4.0,"Pours a clear Golden with a fluffy white head and lively carbonation.  Aroma is loaded with fresh bready pils malts, doughy, lightly yeasty, with a nice hint of herbal and slightly spicy noble german hops.  More bready malt flavor- pure pilsner malts, lightly sweet, hints of grain, and light noble hop bitterness.  Smooth as hell, but doesnt seem as though it could be under 4%.  Maybe it has increased for this new batch?  Awesome helles.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
4283,"2007-03-11",3.4,"On tap at the brewery, this purely golden colored lager pours with a foamy ""shaving cream"" head that leaves excellent lacing the whole way down the glass.  Aroma is fairly malty, and nothing extremely noteworthy, but inviting, none-the-less.  Low in alcohol, but not in flavor, this is a crisp and enjoyable ""summertime"" beer.  The commercial description of this beer is spot on..........another well made Ramstein beer.","New Jersey, USA","HoppityHop"
4283,"2006-11-18",2.8,"This draft brew from the brewery poured a head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that were long lasting and left behind a transparent typically carbonated light yellow-orange colored body and an excellent lacing. The nice aroma was dark malt and lagerish. The crisp and clean mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a bubbly aftertaste. The mild bitter lagerish flavor contained notes of sweet and metallic. An OK brew just nothing special.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
4283,"2006-08-03",3.5,"G Lodge Pub: Hoppier than I expected. Poured a crystal clear yellow producing a short fizzy whiute head. Smooth and easily drinkable.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PWalk"
4283,"2006-03-20",3.5,"on tap at the brewery.  clear gold color, thick off-white frothy head.  honeyish grassy aroma, nice & sweet.  flavor is grassy, dryish, and crisp.  medium to light mouthfeel.  a bit of hop bitterness.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","MullMan"
4283,"2005-03-17",2.9,"on tap at the brewery, poured a clear golden body with a nice amount of white fizzy head. the aroma was mildly hoppy, but for me, that is where the good parts of this beer ended.  the flavor was very plain, mild levels of hops, and even less malts.  aftertaste was ok, on the end of a pretty crisp  mouthfeel, but overall, this was a pretty boring beer...could have been a BMC and would have been hard to tell the difference.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","richlikebeer"
4283,"2004-12-31",3.8,"Bottle. Clear, golden color with a small white head. Mild aroma of straw, hops and malt. Flavor was a nice balance of malt and hops. Tasted almost like a pilsener. Very refreshing and drinkable.","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","jimmack"
4283,"2004-11-20",3.5,"Not a bad Hellles. Malt and some hop flavors.  Finishes clean \, crisp, and dry.","New Jersey, USA","beerslayer"
4283,"2004-06-21",3.5,"On tap Brewtopia 04.  Poured a cloudy yellow with a highlight of orange and a grassy aroma.  Taste was a bit malty with a slight hop undertone.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","Shadrach"
4283,"2004-05-21",3.7,"Classic golden pour with popping pure white head, small bubble size.  Smells more like hay and flowers than it does grass--like an afternoon of bailing rather than a field of fresh cut.  I dont think Im talented enough to pick out the subtleties of the malt nuances, but the malt was solid and the hops finished cleanly.  This is a good summer beer.","Pennsylvania, USA","Probiere"
4283,"2003-10-12",4.2,"Its has a nice clean flavor. Well balanced by hops. Malty. Good beer. Well made.","paramus, New Jersey, USA","mkobes"
4283,"2003-10-12",4.0,"I give this one high marks for being well made. A little hops in the nose, malty with a good balance of hops on the palate. Clean with no real defects. A good quaffer.

Note that this is also known as ""the Golden"".","Good Beer Bar Deprived, New Jersey, USA","MaiBockAddict"
4283,"2002-07-22",3.8,"Clear yellowish. White head. Hoppy aroma, Hallertau mainly with grassy notes. Crisp and refreshing and light. Easy drinking with a solid dose of hops. Grassy, hay like flavor as well. Grainy malts. Should be a hit. Soon to be bottled.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"
