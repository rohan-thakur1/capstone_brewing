2093,"2017-06-20",3.7,"Can shared by hopscotch. The beer is a clear gold with a white head of foam. The aroma has grassy herbal notes. Sweet honey as well. Somewhat tropical. Medium body and medium carbonation.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
2093,"2016-12-28",3.4,"Tap. Moderate grain for the malt, heavy pine and grapefruit peel for the hops, moderate soap for the yeast, with paper and a hint of sulfur in the background. Head is average sized, frothy, white, with good lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is sparkling clear gold. Flavor starts lightly to moderately acidic, then the long finish is lightly acidic and moderately bitter. Palate is on the lighter side of medium, slick with a lively carbonation. A nice smelling Golden Ale, but the hint of sulfur permeates the flavor a bit.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"
2093,"2016-12-03",3.4,"On tap at the brewery. Clear yellow pour with a white head. Grassy bouquet. Florally hops give way to bitter almost Pilsner like notes. Average body and mouthfeel. Earlier Rating: 2/5/2016 Total Score: 3.5On tap at the brewery. Clear light yellow pour with a white head. No real aroma. A fair amount of grain and cereal notes. Not too much after that. Some bitterness from the hops but the flavor profile is hard to place. Average body and mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"
2093,"2016-10-16",3.8,"16oz can courtesy of a box from Homer321. Sean doing work, son. Pours a decent hazed straw yellow hue, frothy bubbly bright stark white head is sizable, foamy, with a decent layer and thicker ringer remaining overall. The color is a bit faded, lemony and straw colors are pale, mellow, hazed gently. Aromas show some fruity Mosaic appeal, tropical and a bit bitter. Florals, bready malts, crisp straw and cleaner simple maltbill. Dry, bitter, a bit soapy and green floral bitterness pick up as it settles. Mango, tangerine, bubblegum, and a plethora of passionfruit essence. Initial is lighter bodied, bitter and fruity elements show passionfruit, guava, tropical melange and decent bitter pop. Light body, crisp, clean with nice fruity and bitter floral appeal. A bit of aspirin like bitter appeal, dry and a bit chalky into the backend and finish. Supporting bitterness, lighter bodied with some pleasant flavors and fruit. Never effervescent or bubbly, instead clean, light, very crushable. Appealing flavors without overwhelming. Really nice Blonde/Golden Ale.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

2093,"2016-10-02",3.7,"Can, with mosaic. Pours hazy golden, small white head, dissipates fairly quickly, decent lacing. Aroma is light overall, dank, tropical, fruity, lime, guava. Flavor is light sweet, light bitter, clean but the mosaic is muted. Plus body.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
2093,"2016-09-24",3.4,"Can from source. Nose is moderate tropical with light danky and onion. Lightly hazy, not the typical orange juice appearance. Medium sized white head. Taste is initially bitter with a soft pillowy malt backbone. Hop flavor is minimal, mostly grassy. Starts to grow after a couple sips but still has an aspirin water sensation to it. Ok.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
2093,"2016-08-30",4.3,"My Bottom Line:
Juicy mangoes, elderflowers and citrus fruit sit on a crisp haystack, building the quintessential beach quaffer.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A fluffly head of foam stays atop the misty straw blond.
-Carbonation feels natural and airy, working wonderfully with the flavour profile.
-A touch of sulphur can be noticed in the nose, but it quickly vanishes.
-Resinous bitterness is moderate. This is mostly aroma and flavour, which increases drinkability.
-Ginger undercurrents appear soon enough.
-This is just perfect for Florida weather.
-Mouthfeel is lean and quenching.
-Finally! A Floridian brewery nails this type of beer which works oh so well with their environment. Fruity, dry, airy, quenching. There is something special happening at Civil Society and Orchid Island which will hopefully inspire other breweries away from the heavy IPAs and such.
-This is exactly the kind of beer that has made Oakham Ales so successful in the UK. 
-Change the name and youÂ’ve got a world beater.

2093,"2016-03-21",4.0,"Crowler at HMOG. Solid sessionable IPA with big, super wafting hop aroma. Light body. Crisp but very bitter hop profile. Pleasantly bitter, citrus kind of thing.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
2093,"2016-01-10",3.6,"Clear straw with minimal head. Light mouthfeel, sweet but not overbearing, and then a nice clear hoppy profile. Very easy drinking. I don't usually like Blonde beer but I like this.

2093,"2015-12-09",3.8,"On tap at the brewery. Lightly hazy yellow body. Light grain aroma. Orange hops. Maybe wheat or something that lends a mineral aroma. Tastes of grainy malts and orange hops up front in equal portions. Mineral flavor is stronger too. Light bodied and very drinkable. Excellent blonde ale.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
