Sherry Barrel Atrial Rubicite was brewed with Hill Country well water, barley, wheat, oats, and hops.

2308,TRUE,9,,Brasserie de l??Abbaye des Rocs,270,"Abbaye des Rocs (9% alcohol vol.) is a pure malt beer, with no added sugar. The entire range of tastes is directly linked to the double fermentation, the precise quantities of malts (7 types) as well as the mixtures of three kinds of hops (Belgian, German and Czech). Its colour is a striking deep and majestic red. Its taste is rich and full of subtlety. It is tasted like a red wine with which it shares the ruby colour without having the tannin. It develops a strong sweet smell. It confirms the initial impression in the first mouthful, with a sharp body that is balanced with a certain fruitiness. It frees itself on the palate and develops an impressive depth of taste. Some traces of burnt wood are detectable, but never scorched even if it contains this kind of malt.

Though the recipe and process for Arctic Devil have evolved over the years, it is brewed once a year then aged in oak barrels for several months before the entire batch is blended, bottled and released. Beginning in 2010, ADBW will be released in late SEP.
 
In its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table.
 
Each annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment.

Up until this creation, our goal was to focus on what we call ""tart"" beers - ones that incorporate acidity but are not dominated by it. We've grown comfortable with this approach, and our quest for a house flavor has been fruitful. Cellar Palette, a sour brown ale with raspberries, marks a different path for SARA. Longer aging times in wine barrels, more robust use of brettanomyces and bacteria, and creative blending all come together to form this mouth-puckering, but balanced, wonder.

Then after a sterile filtration (to eliminate primary yeast strains) the beer is transfered in a steel vessel with transparent membrane and a ""oxygen hat"". Afeter several tasting from 6 to 24 months later (it depends on the oxidation velocity, very inconsistant!) the brewer decides when it's time to bottle in 50cl. champagne shape bottles with good quality cork. The production is very limited. Three productions brewed during two years will be available from October 2006.  

Teo Musso produces three versions Gold, Silver & Copper label which differ from each other in terms of degree of oxidation allowed and fruity perfumery aromas created.  Teo's objective is to allow Xyauyu to perfectly oxidize during the aging proces of 2.5 years {oxidation plays a critical role in aging port, sherry, as well as our vintage beers - too much oxidation will ruin the liquid - too little will not optimize the change in flavor / aroma during the aging process} .Here's how Teo's system works: Xyauyu is transfered to a steel vessel with transparent membrane and a ""oxygen hat"". After several tastings during the 2.5 year aging process Teo decides when it's time to bottle (it all depends upon the oxidation velocity). 
This golden beer reminds of an enjoyable Madera or an intriguing Chateau Chalon of the French Jura.

ABV: 13.7%

Liner Notes
We've never released a Bourbon Barrel version of our Judgment Day. So we thought it might be interesting to take the base beer for Cuvee de Tomme age in first fill Bourbon Barrels and let mother nature take over. Of course, because this is a Rock and Roll inspired Box Set beer, we couldn't just leave well enough alone.

The conversations turned to Oatmeal Raisin cookies and the essence of a freshly baked treat. So we added some cinnamon sticks to the barrels and threw in some dried chiles as well.

Share our tribute to friendships new and old.

 
The aroma starts with some malty, caramel notes like a sprinkling of brown sugar. Fruity overtones from the fermentation build on the inviting sweetness and add to the complexity. A bright hint of lemon from the hops tops it off.

Malty sweetness creates the first layer of flavor and on that foundation, fruity flavors of plums, pears and a touch of apple pie develop. The hops again serve to brighten the finish and add a balance to the malty sweetness .

Over time these flavors and aromas will deepen and continue to develop. Undertones of raisons, figs and prunes will add maturity and the hops will continue to soften until they become but a faint background for the sweet, fruitiness of the malts. Of course, that means you have to save some to find out!

Just as you might gently warm a winter brandy, let your barleywine come up to around 50-55?? to allow for the best appreciation of its flavors and aromas.

 
Old Backus gains complexity from a blend of American and English Pale Malts as well English Crystal Malt and Amber Malt. Generosity is the name of the game with just over 1/3 of a pound of malt in every pint

 
Where complexity serves in the malt bill, focus and simplicity is the key to our hops. Domestic Nugget and Crystal hops add some balancing bitterness and a hint of citrus to the aroma

The Oak Aged Batch 21 has a dark brown mahogany colour and a beige brown head. The soft aroma immediately reminds you of walnuts. Accompanied by a slightly smoky aroma, you can detect oak, caramel malt, alcohol, vanilla and, of course, French brandy. The flavour, although balanced, is not particularly mellow. The brandy barrels have clearly left a lot of wood influences, which manifest themselves in vanilla and almond. Additionally, the Quadrupel has a caramel-like, slightly sweet flavour with a good, full body. The flavour ends with a slightly burnt tone and a hint of wood tannin. Due to the light tingling of the carbonic acid, combined with the wood flavour and sweetness of the beer, the sensation in the mouth is full and pleasant.

Its fine bouquet is best savoured when this batch is served at a temperature of 16-18 ??C (61 ?? 64.5 ??F).

359,TRUE,6,,Jester King Brewery,180,"Our first brew was a turbid mash of 60% malted barley and 40% raw Texas wheat. We followed the mash schedule found in Jeff Sparrow's Wild Brews. The first runnings were very starchy. We boiled the wort for four hours with hops aged in burlap bags in the attic of our horse barn. 
 
We transferred the entire batch of wort to a ~15 barrel coolship we had fabricated out of stainless steel. We let the wort cool overnight exposed to airborne yeast and bacteria. The next day, we racked the cooled wort to oak puncheons without pitching any yeast or bacteria. We then waited patiently to see if anything would happen. 
 
After about a week, and much to our amazement, the wort started to ferment. Early on, the beer was very harsh, astringent, and bitter. It had an unpleasant grainy character, smelled like cooked corn, and was very turbid. The only thing that gave us hope at that point, was the beer still tasted pretty ??clean?? despite the astringency and noticeable off-flavors. But then, after about six months, we noticed a transformation. The grainy, cooked corn aroma gave way to a very pleasant musty attic, barnyard scent. The bitterness still lingered, but the astringency had mellowed. We could tell the beer was slowly becoming more refined as it aged. This gave us hope ?? enough hope that we were encouraged to try spontaneous fermentation again the following winter. 
 
The winter of 2014 marked our second coolship season. Unlike our first season in 2013, where we only did two 15 barrel batches, we did around a dozen coolship brews the second season. Fermentation was vigorous, and the beer overall was less bitter and more sour than 2013. We believe this had to do with decreasing our hopping rate for our second season. We used around 0.75 pounds per barrel of hops rather than 1.25 pounds per barrel. We also think our aged hops had less bitterness after another full year aging in the attic of the horse barn. 
 
Our third coolship season began in January, 2015. By this point, we were pretty confident the wort would spontaneously ferment and slowly mature over time. We felt we hit our sweet spot in terms of our hopping rate, settling around one pound per barrel. Balancing acidity is a critical part of what we do, and we really like the soft, restrained acidity from our 2015 coolship season. 
 
Finally, in February of 2016 we created our first blend! We took ten percent beer from 2013, thirty percent beer from 2014, and sixty percent beer from 2015, blended it, then packaged it in bottles and kegs. We did not pitch any yeast or bacteria at the time of bottling, but rather relied on the microbes still alive in the beer for refermentation. We did however add a dose of priming sugar at the time of packaging. We experimented with refermenting the blend using the residual sugar in the younger beer. However, this technique did not produce the level of carbonation we wanted. We refermented the bottles on their sides. Not only is this true to the traditional method of Gueuze, but we've become huge proponents of shallow vessel fermentation on a sensory level. 
 
The three year blend has been slowly maturing in bottles since February, 2016 and will be nine months old at the time of release. Extended refermentation and maturation in the serving vessel is another technique that's true to the method of Gueuze, which we find absolutely critical. A lot of the funky, basement cellar, musty attic aromas that we love simply are not present at the time of blending and need time in the bottle to develop. In our opinion, there is no substitute for extended refermentation / maturation for beers of this style.",,"https://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_120,c_limit/beer_418488.jpg",,Jester King 2016 SPON Methode Gueuze,50,99,FALSE,,Lambic Style - Gueuze,75,/beerstyles/lambic-style--gueuze/73/,[],/beer/jester-king-2016-spon-methode-gueuze/418488/,3.9

The first Kriek Lambic in our LAMBICKX line! Wonderful aroma of almonds, macaroon and cherry stones. Dry, elegant fruit palate. Lightly sparkling to still. 
Lambics are truly the ""wines"" of the beer world. Just as wines vary by season, soil, climate, and aging method, lambics (unlike any other type of beer) vary by season, brewery location, barrel size and wood type and length of aging. 
 
With wines one talks of ""gout du terroir"" because the land (terroir) so influences a wine's flavor. With lambics one must speak of ""gout du tonneau"" because each cask (tonneau) produces a lambic that matures and tastes different. Thanks to this variation, a lambic's character comes not only from the base beer made by the brewer but from the casks selected and blended together. And because lambic is lightly sparkling, the flavors and nuances developed through the cask aging can be fully tasted and appreciated, like in gueuze, which is highly sparkling but much less complex.

No longer is it only an awareness among the faithful; the unconverted are beginning to feel it as well. Denial and ignorance are disappearing in favor of opened eyes, curiosity and the sense that there's something larger out there. For far too long we have been lied to. For far too long we have been oppressed by the notion that dumbed-down-lowest-common-denominator-mediocrity was all that we could, and should, expect. You might think we're talking only about the world of brewing, but we're not. There is a myriad of products out there masquerading as cheeses, coffee, chocolates, breads...hell, there is stuff pretending to be 'food' that our great grandmothers would not recognize as such. Yet the craft brewing movement, together with the artisanal food movement, is making much progress. Where the industrial companies can't dismiss or bury us, they are attempting to copy us with cheap facsimiles. Yes, chances are if you are holding this bottle, you understand these things to be true about the world of brewing. You also likely understand the importance of our fight at Stone against accepted 'norms' over the last 15 years. We believed that America was ready to embrace things made with artistry and passion. You have spoken. Your response has been clear. We are not merely consumers to be spoon-fed whatever commodities need to be unloaded for a profit. We have only just begun to move the needle of this revolution, & mediocrity still reigns. Consider that when you reject dumbed down, industrialized food and drink, you also support craft brewing. The line is nearly seamless; we are fighting the same battle. We will not win in our lifetime, as the powers are too entrenched, and the masses too??????fooled. And shackled. However, this is a revolution of ideas and of taste, and we will win. How do you want to be viewed by your children, and your children's children? As a hero, or as the oppressed? (Those that don't think they have been oppressed are already lost.) Ultimately, it's up to you to decide. We hope you'll stand with us. Strong and unyielding. You are needed. This bottle and its glorious contents are a celebration of you, brothers and sisters, and your importance in this fight.

Part 2 of a 4 beer collaboration between Cigar City, Hill Farmstead, and Grassroots.

A note from Joey Redner:  ""The beers are basically black IPA's brewed with lots of Citra, Mt. Rainier and Simcoe along with Ty Ty honey from North Florida aged on medium toast Spanish Cedar. There are different hop additions in the Hill Farmstead/Grassroots version (Or) and the 2-row base malt in the CCB version (Either) is replaced with Pilsner malt in the Vermont/Denmark version (Or). There are also some process differences which is one of the purposes of a collaboration; allowing breweries to learn from each other.

The goal was to make two beers that were alike, but slightly different due to preferences in regional approach and access to ingredients. The four beers in this collaborative series will be named: 

Either, Or, Neither and Nor. Either and Or will release first and the other two will follow.

We've discovered that the Lagunitas brewers are part time alchemists... they've figured out how to keep wet hops wet all freakin' year long! The next beer in our 2016 #OneHitter Series is this Born Again Yesterday Pale Ale, which features a delicious concoction of wet hops, reborn and unfiltered into our Born Yesterday Pale Ale. Congrats... It's a beer again!
 
MORE ABOUT THE FREAKIN' WET HOPS:

To figure out this brand new wet hop preservation process, we had to forget everything that we already knew about how hops are processed and preserved. We tried 5 or 6 different things to try and achieve this process (some of which failed miserably), then we discovered a relatively simple process that deliberately did all the things that the textbooks told us not to do.
 
This new proprietary process involves a lot of time and money, and even more thinking about hops and freshness in new ways. From all of this, we found a brand-spankin'-new way to preserve the hops, fresh from the Yakima Valley trellises, first born during harvest season into the Born Yesterday last fall, and reborn into this scary new next step, the Born Again Yesterday Pale Ale, six months later, to the beer in your hands today.

To give The Dissident its characteristic sour taste the brewery used a wild yeast strain called Brettanomyces (also known as Brett) during fermentation. Known throughout the wine world for creating earthy undertones found in many European wines, Brett is used in the beer fermentation process to create strong flavors typically associated with Belgian beers. Unlike English varieties that use traditional inoculated yeasts in the fermentation process, beers made with Brett take much longer to ferment and require additional barrel finishing time to balance the sour flavoring. In the Dissident's case, this meant aging a portion of it in pinot and cabernet barrels for over 3 months. Another key flavor component comes from the Central Washington cherries that were added twelve months ago.
 
 
Due to the wild yeast , The Dissident required special treatment and was held in isolation under lock and key apart from the rest of the brewery's beers to avoid any cross-contamination. A secondary bottling line was also brought in from an outside contractor to facilitate The Dissident's bottling and insure the beer and wild yeast never touched the brewery's machinery.

With a beer this wild and truly unique, Deschutes needed a special label to alert consumers to what lay inside. The resulting image immediately sets The Dissident apart from the other Deschutes Brewery beers, even the Reserve Series beers.
 
 
The fruit and acidity in The Dissident make it ideal for pairing with a wide variety of dishes - the high acidity is perfect for cutting creamy dishes or cooling spicy ones. Because of the fruity characteristics derived from the cherries, the beer also pairs well with chocolate. Deschutes Brewery President and Founder Gary Fish recommends pairing the Dissident with ??anything chocolate, the darker the better, soft cheeses like Brie and creamy dishes like spaghetti carbonara, or macaroni and cheese.??
 
 
A very limited amount of The Dissident will be available September 1st as part of the brewery's Reserve Series in hand-waxed 22-ounce bottles...

4062,TRUE,5,,Cantillon,150,"The Cantillon brewery is closely linked to Brussels, a city which has the iris as its symbol. As the name indicates, the ""marsh iris"" is a plant growing in humid areas. The historical center of Brussels is built on swamps where this flower used to grow abundantly.
 
In 1998, the Brussels Museum of the Gueuze celebrated its 20th anniversary. The Cantillon brewery decided to make a new spontaneous fermentation beer for this occasion, named after this symbolic flower.
 
It is a completely original beer which, contrary to the other products of the Brewery, is not brewed with 35% of wheat. The Iris, which is only made with malt of the pale ale type (giving a more amber colour to the beer) conserves the typical flavour of the spontaneous fermentation, the complex aromas and the vinous taste.
 
The hopping is different too. Lambic is made with 100% dried hops, for the Iris we use 50% of dried hops and 50% of fresh hops. The latter cause a superb acidity, the former, due to their tannins, enable to conserve the beer while preserving all its qualities.
 
After two years in the barrel, the Iris undergoes a second fresh hopping two weeks before the bottling. A linen bag, filled with hops, is soaked in the beer for two weeks. This technique, called ""cold hopping"", gives the beer a more intense savour and makes the smell and the taste more bitter.",,"https://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_120,c_limit/beer_11630.jpg",,Cantillon Iris,1340,99,FALSE,,Lambic Style - Unblended,97,/beerstyles/lambic-style--unblended/78/,"[pediococcus, dry-hopped sour, cellar favorite, dry hopped, 1001 beers you must taste before you die, 100 belgian]",/beer/cantillon-iris/11630/,3.86

The very first release of a Love Child blend was 100% soured Bourbon Barrel Quad, but each subsequent batch has included an increasing amount of Flanders-style red. For that reason, the strength has been steadily declining from the 12.5 ABV of Love Child No. 1 to more recent releases in the 8-9.5% range.  
Following primary fermentation with our house Belgian yeast strain, the component batches of beer were aged in a variety of whiskey and wine barrels as well as stainless steel tanks. Following aging in those vessels with lactobacillus and brettanomyces, samples were pulled from like lots and blended during a tasting session attended by brewers and members of our quality assurance team. With each release of a Love Child blend, it's not our intention to reproduce the character of the previous blend, but rather to offer a blend of the very best sour beers we have on hand. 

The blend for Love Child No. 7 breaks down as follows: 

Previously used red wine barrels ?? 48%
Previously used whiskey barrels ?? 30%
Stainless tanks ?? 22% 

The resulting beer was blended together in a bottling tank on our Smokestack Series bottling line and inoculated with brettanomyces and our bottle conditioning yeast strain. 

Pouring a slightly hazy, reddish amber hue, Love Child No. 7 opens with aromas of red fruit with a slight acidity detected. Lactobacillus provides a crisp, refreshing acidity with fruit, oak and subtle spice notes presenting in the flavor of the beer. Ending fermentation quite dry at 1.75 Plato, Love Child No. 7 tapers to a subtle oaky finish that begs for another sip.

Adding cultures of Brettanomyces, Pediococcus and Lactobacillus at set points let us sour the beer gradually over many months and give layers of flavour that can only develop over time.

Introducing the newest addition to Uinta Brewing Company's lineup, Dubhe (pronounced Doo-bee), an Imperial Black IPA. 
 
Dubhe was named after Utah's Centennial Star, a star classified as a Red Giant.  Dubhe, the star, appears orange in color, and is found at the top end of the big dipper's spoon. The name ??Dubhe?? continues Uinta's tradition of celebrating the great state of Utah, however, ??Dubhe?? is a fitting name for more than that reason: this beer is as black as the night sky and is brewed with an astronomical amount of hops.
 
 Dubhe is comprised of five hop varieties, a hop profile bold enough to shine through the roasted, dark malt character of this beer. A citrusy hop aroma, achieved by dry hopping with a proprietary blend of extreme Northwest hops, balanced with notes of mild dark chocolate and a hint of sweet licorice. Smooth from start to finish, Dubhe's layered flavor profile emerges with rich and rounded toasted malt flavors, and is followed by a lively hop bitterness. At over 5 pounds of hops per barrel, Dubhe is the most hop-laden beer Uinta has ever produced.

 This shinning new addition is brewed with hemp seed (A play on the name, perhaps?), and has a far-out ABV of 9.2%.",,"https://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_120,c_limit/beer_137681.jpg",,Uinta Dubhe Imperial Black IPA,834,98,FALSE,Special,Black IPA,98,/beerstyles/black-ipa/114/,"[hemp, double black ipa, falconer??s flight]",/beer/uinta-dubhe-imperial-black-ipa/137681/,3.8

Exactly three years ago the famous Oak Aged Sp??tburgunder was first launched on the market. This second version of the famous German red wine is strikingly different. Both in terms of bouquet and taste the aroma of this pinot noir is very recognisable. There are also notes of sweet apple, banana and dates. The overall taste association produces an effect of spices. The fairly rigorous carbonization ensures a tantalising aroma and flavour. The taste includes a lot of wood tannins. This comes from a subtly sweet red wine that hints at a port wine. The taste lingers and slowly develops with a red-wine aftertaste.  With a gentle hint of tobacco, this BATCH 23 from the famous Quadrupel is beery and full-flavoured. The alcohol remains firmly in the background, although the 11% of the Quadrupel is preserved.

Its fine bouquet is best savoured when this batch is served at a temperature of 16-18 ??C (61 ?? 64.5 ??F).

We began our sour ale project in 2006 with only four oak barrels previously used to store red wine. The number has grown over the years, along with the amount of sour ale we've brewed. Each barrel develops unique characteristics as it ferments independently, and just as Belgian brewers have been doing for centuries, we sought out our favorite barrels, ranging in age from one to three years old, for blending. By blending the sour ale from these barrels together in various amounts, we created in this bottle a live harmony of tartness, fruitiness and layers of flavor that can never be replicated. We hope you enjoy it with friends, whenever and wherever.

The nose is full of pumpkin pie spices and some alcohol. There are notes of nutmeg, caraway and vanilla. The taste starts with chocolate malt with a hint of spice and rolls into a warm spicy alcohol taste which has the effect of creating the balance that usually comes from the hop bitter. There is some hop bitter on the finish, but not much. Overall, this beer finishes relatively dry for such a big beer. As it warms, the spices move forward in the taste and the chocolate moves to the finish. The pumpkin provides a pleasant undertone and a nice mouthfeel. The spices will probably fade some over time; they mellowed considerably while still in the fermenter.

Seven Kingdoms Hoppy Wheat Ale, the newest beer in the Game of Thrones series from HBO Global Licensing and Brewery Ommegang, is slated to debut this spring ahead of the premiere of season six of HBO's critically-acclaimed and Emmy award-winning show. The brew will be available all throughout the realm ?? the United States that is ?? both on draft and in large-format 750ml bottles. 
 
Seven Kingdoms is a marriage of a traditional Belgian-style wheat and a hop-forward American ale ?? but unlike so many of the marriages on the show, the resulting hoppy wheat is pleasant, playful and inspired. At 6.9% ABV, it possesses a nuanced complexity that pairs nicely with the hop-forward characteristics that make it surprisingly refreshing. 

??We love bringing as much inspiration, thoughtfulness and creativity to the Game of Thrones beers as we can,?? said Mike McManus, Innovation Manger at Brewery Ommegang. ??This last season, the imaginativeness of the show was pretty astounding so we aimed for a beer that could hope to match that. A fusion of two wonderful styles was an idea that really excited our team.?? 

??With Seven Kingdoms, Ommegang has crafted another excellent brew which we know our fans will love,?? said Josh Goodstadt, Vice President of Global Licensing at HBO. ??The world of Westeros is varied and complex and this varietal embodies those characteristics while offering a new and unique taste to beer drinkers.?? 

Seven Kingdoms pours a hazy pale yellow with a thick cap of pure white foam. The aroma is floral, citrusy with a touch of passion fruit and a slightly herbal hop aroma underpinned with yeast notes of banana, ripe fruit, and spicy phenols. The taste is a full, round hop flavor with tart orange and lemon with a substantial wheat maltiness and the finish has slightly lingering hop notes without being harshly bitter. The mouthfeel is smooth and silken owing to the wheat and oats. 

The new brew is hopped with Bravo, Centennial, Citra, Cascade, and Columbus, and brewed with pilsner, white and red wheat, oats, and a touch of sugar to lighten the body. Ommegang's unique house yeast is used in both primary fermentation and bottling conditioning.",,"https://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_120,c_limit/beer_406295.jpg",,Ommegang Game of Thrones #6 - Seven Kingdoms,204,97,FALSE,Series,Belgian Ale,100,/beerstyles/belgian-ale/12/,"[bravo, cascade, centennial, citra, columbus, oats, celebrity, collaboration, series]",/beer/ommegang-game-of-thrones-6--seven-kingdoms/406295/,3.75

Scotch Ales are some of the world's most flavorful beers. Scotland's cold, blustery climate lends itself to the growing of barley and oats, but not to the production of hops, which are almost always added sparingly.
 
The yeast must work at cooler temperatures than is customary for ales, resulting in maltier, cleaner, less fruity or estery, beers. The color often comes from black roasted malt, which imparts some dryness, but because of the lower attenuation and hopping rates, Scottish ales are almost always slightly sweet and incredibly drinkable.
 
Ours was brewed with black roasted barley, biscuit and peat-smoked malt. It was gently hopped, fermented cool and aged cold for weeks for smoothness. It is copper-brown in color, with some sweet maltiness and plenty of body.

But we received a mail from head brewer Wayne Wambles saying: ""Hey guys, I'm coming back for the Copenhagen Beer Celebration, why don't we brew a beer?"" And since Wayne is not only one of the nicest persons in the craft beer world but also one of the most innovative and skilled, it was an easy decision to make room in our schedule for another Cigar City collaboration.
The beer of choice turned out to be ""Orange Crush"" a so called Session IPA - low in alcohol and potency, but high in drinkability. Heavily dry-hopped with the juiciest of American aroma hops: Citra, Mosaic and Simcoe and a solid dose of our secret ingredient, a super fragrant brand of American orange peel.

Rabbie was a poet and a lyricist. He is widely regarded as the national poet of Scotland, and is celebrated worldwide. He is the best known of the poets who have written in the Scots language, although much of his writing is also in English and a 'light' Scots dialect, accessible to an audience beyond Scotland. He also wrote in standard English, and in these pieces, his political or civil commentary is often at its most blunt. 
 
He is regarded as a pioneer of the Romantic movement and after his death became a great source of inspiration to the founders of both liberalism and socialism. 
 
As well as making original compositions, Burns also collected folk songs from across Scotland, often revising or adapting them. His poem (and song) Auld Lang Syne is often sung at Hogmanay (New Year), and Scots Wha Hae served for a long time as an unofficial national anthem of the country. Other poems and songs of Burns that remain well-known across the world today, include A Red, Red Rose, A Man's A Man for A' That, To a Louse, To a Mouse, The Battle of Sherramuir, and Ae Fond Kiss. 
 
Every January, Barley's Smokehouse & Brewpub hosts its Robert Burns Dinner and Robert Burns Scottish Export Ale Tapping to celebrate his birthday and ato toast to His Immortal Memory.

First, distinctive fruity aromas like banana and honeydew melon come to the fore, followed by fine cloves. Andechser Weissbier Hell is a very tangy, refreshing treat with the conviction of a full, soft body. It concludes on a finely balanced interplay of light sweet honey and a delicate acidity with undertones of bitter hoppiness that quickly subside into a harmonious aftertaste.

We attempted to capture some of our sensory experience of the barn by adding ingredients found in the attic to the beer. We added bales of hay to the mash and old hops that had spent many months in burlap bags to the boil. Further providing inspiration for Repos?? was Bi??re de Garde, a traditional French farmhouse beer that likely originated out of the stone-walled barns that dot the landscape of northern France. Bi??re de Garde was historically brewed in fall and winter to take advantage of cooler fermentation temperatures, and aged for months before drinking. Similarly, Repos?? was brewed during February of 2014 and slowly fermented for months prior to being blended and packaged in January of 2015. 

The wort for Repos?? was brewed with Texas Hill Country water from our well, malted barley, hay, aged hops, and fresh hops. It was then pitched with Jester King's unique mixed culture of brewer's yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery.

The purists may well wonder what on earth a Belgian IPA is supposed to be?? And we might wonder the same. However, this was a no brainer in terms of building a beer with a tonne of flavour, derived from a distinct yeast character and generous amount of dry hopping. 
 
??Juicy' comes to mind when describing this beer. We allowed the beer to free rise in fermentation. This means rather than fermenting at a controlled temperature (usually around 20 degrees c), the yeast is allowed to go crazy, climbing up to around 30 degrees c  ?? the idea here being that a warmer fermentation produces much more of the fruit and spice esters that characterise a Saison yeast. It also helps to produce a dry finish in the beer (1.009) which ultimately brings a nice bit of balance to those big, juicy fruit flavours. 
  
Mosaic works beautifully well in this beer; favoured this time for its heavily aromatic character but with a much more rounded fruit profile (think tropical, soft fruits, berry etc) than most big American hop varieties.

Generaal will mature in the bottle and is for the experienced beer lover. Generaal has a marked bitterness obtained by using roasted malt and hops. It is not a sweet beer.

The citrus and floral aromas are from the four varieties of hops. The ruby red hues and peppery flavors are a result of using some red rye malt in the mash.  We hopped it up with Columbus, Centennial, Chinook and Willamette hops for an aggressive hop finish.

We made our Hopped Rye with the finest Two Row barley and red rye malt, plenty of hops, pure Moab water and house ale yeast.  This beer is not filtered and is still alive- a process called bottle conditioning.  Other than the natural carbonation produced by bottle conditioning, it also helps to preserve the beer.  Expect a small amount of yeast in the bottle and please do not overheat- temperatures above 75??F are damaging to the sleeping yeast.

The Hopped Rye pairs well with gorgonzola, cambozola, rich artisan blue cheeses, strong spicy dishes with curry, smoked beef brisket and grilled lamb.  Brilliant with caramel apple tart, ginger spice cake and cr??me brul??e.

Store upright, chill and serve at 50??F to 55??F.  Use wide mouth glassware to allow the vibrant malt and hop aromas to escape.

A thought turned into reality and Schneider Weisse's newest TAP X 'Meine Porter Weisse', was born! TAP X 'Meine Porter Weisse' is a singularly stunning new creation which expertly showcases the depths of the range these two heavyweights of beer, when tapped into, then offer. 

For the creation of the new TAPX 2014, George Schneider drew inspiration from some of his English brewing colleagues, ??If you intensively busy yourself with the history of porter, closely examine its aroma profile and compare it to a classic wheat beer, you'll soon realize that there is a basis for the development of an expressive character on this union??, says Schneider Weisse brewmaster Hans-Peter Drexler, when he explains the emergence of this new TAPX. ??A historically bold but in taste ultimately a very appropriate combination of two wayward beer styles,??Drexler concludes.

TAPX Meine Porter Weisse shimmers ebony-colored in your glass, crowed with a fine-pored, creamy head. Hints of chocolate and coffee come to your mind. The roasting flavors flatter your palate and award the beer with fine bitterness. A pleasantly dry mouthfeel completes this enjoyment. The complex aroma profile is the expression of a successful association of these contrasting beer styles.

Georg Schneider himself gives us some of his own suggestions for possible food pairings with the new TAP X:  ??Personally, I've been enjoying the pairing of our TAPX 'Meine Porter Weisse' most with hefty sausages or smoked bacon...it is then, when some wonderful memories of 'evenings at the pub' back in London, arise.??",24,"https://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_120,c_limit/beer_245290.jpg",,Schneider Weisse Tap X Meine Porter Weisse,323,94,FALSE,,Weizen Bock,95,/beerstyles/weizen-bock/25/,[],/beer/schneider-weisse-tap-x-meine-porter-weisse/245290/,3.63

Please welcome our new beer Queen Mary brewed in a very special and almost forgotten style - Burton Ale! Just recently a daughter of our brewmaster has been born. Her name is Maria, so we decided to follow the English brewer's tradition to brew some special batch dedicated to the child birth. The part of this batch will be stored until her 18th birthday. We were carefully working on the recipe and stopped at Old Burton Ale - quite unusual strong pale ale. This beer was brewed in the Burton-on-Trent long before it became famous for it's India Pale Ales. This beer in the the same way as Imperial Stouts was very popular in Russia and Poland. And it's because of Russian taxes increase on pale beer import the Burton brewers decided to switch to another market - India. Burton Ale - strong and sweet beer. Historically the colour of the beer was pale-amber (in 19th century) to deep-nut-brown (in 20th). We took the recipe of 1843 as the basis for this beer and used pale malt only. Traditionally this beer was heavily hopped. We took Fuggles hops for bittering and East Kent Goldings for dry hopping. We used two strains of yeasts to ferment this beer including a special yeasts from Burton. And of course the water was well prepared to mimic the high in minerals water content of Burton. We have added a bit of gypsum and other salts. The result is a strong 11% ABV sweet pale ale with astonishing hoppy grassy and earthy aroma and hints of caramel in the nose, bright malty taste and solid bitterness in aftertaste. This beer needs to be consumed slowly and meditatively, taking every sip carefully with history recognition. This beer will perfectly sit on a festive table. 
We are welcoming everyone to taste Queen Mary Old Burton Ale and touch the history!",80,"https://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_120,c_limit/beer_318061.jpg",3.66,Victory Art Brew Queen Mary,32,92,FALSE,Special,English Strong Ale,97,/beerstyles/english-strong-ale/56/,[],/beer/victory-art-brew-queen-mary/318061/,3.58

Buford's Roadside Wares was brewed with pecans and wheat from both Texas and Arizona, inoculated with native yeast and bacteria in our coolship, and fermented in brandy barrels previously containing Jester King Repos??. The recipe was inspired by the Franco-Belgian farmhouse tradition of Bi??re de Garde.

Back in January of 2015, Jonathan Buford and Patrick Ware of Arizona Wilderness traveled to Jester King to brew with us on a freezing cold day. The temperature was about 15 degrees Fahrenheit when they showed up at the brewery. They brought with them some Arizona pecans and Sonora White Wheat, which we combined with Texas pecans and raw wheat. We brewed a medium gravity wort with pecans in the mash and fuggle hops in the boil, and knocked the wort out into our coolship. From there, the wort cooled overnight and was inoculated with native yeast and bacteria from the Texas Hill Country. The next morning, we drained the wort out of our coolship, pitched it with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria, and then racked it into brandy barrels for fermentation.

Buford's Roadside Wares was our ??momentum batch?? for 2015. At the outset of each coolship season, we brew a momentum batch designed to get the airborne yeast and bacteria at the brewery ??woken up??. Basically, we put out some food for the yeast (fresh wort) and allowed it to get all riled up for spontaneous fermentation. The idea of kickstarting spontaneous fermentation season with a ??momentum batch?? comes from the baking/bread world, and was recommended to us back in 2013 by our friends at Allagash Brewing Co. We've been conducting a momentum batch every year since 2014, and we've noticed how the microbial momentum builds throughout our coolship season. The pace at which spontaneous fermentation begins, and the vigor with which it proceeds, intensifies as the season wears on. Buford's Roadside Wares got the momentum going for our 2015 coolship season! After accomplishing that task, we pitched the cooled wort with our mixed culture, rather than allowing it to ferment spontaneously.

Buford's Roadside Wares was brewed on January 8th, 2015 with raw well water, malted barley, raw wheat, pecans, and hops. It was fermented in brandy barrels for 12 months prior to packaging on January 25th, 2016. The beer was 100% naturally conditioned by refermentation in bottles, kegs, and casks. Around the time of packaging, it was 6.4% alcohol by volume, 3.2 pH, 13 IBU, and had a finishing gravity of 1.002 (0.5 degrees Plato).",13,"https://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_120,c_limit/beer_406626.jpg",,Jester King / Arizona Wilderness Brewing Buford??s Roadside Wares,57,90,FALSE,,Bi??re de Garde,97,/beerstyles/biere-de-garde/58/,[],/beer/jester-king--arizona-wilderness-brewing-bufords-roadside-wares/406626/,3.54

Robbie, on the other hand, is the Igor to Rich's Dr. Frankenstein (but with less hunchback and more beard). Armed with only a four-letter acronym (KISS) and a mission to make a beer that was balanced and complex but still sessionable, Rick jotted down a recipe on a sticky note that would impress even the most seasoned brewmaster. 

Out of 19 amazing beers brewed by 19 teams of the best brewers at Stone Brewing Co., Steve Wagner (Co-founder & President), Greg Koch (Co-founder & CEO), and Mitch Steele (Brewmaster) chose this one after a blind tasting of the top nine beers. As we write this, we are honored and humbled by the decision to select our beer for the very first Stone Brewing Co. Spotlight Series release. Our original goal was to pay tribute to the SNL Sprockets skit by creating a beer that even Dieter would think ""is dark and easy to drink,"" and we're pretty sure we succeeded (Dieter's not around to ask).

We love this beer and can't wait to share it with beer geeks and Stone fans around the country.

On this side of the pond, you'll sometimes see ESB called ""Extra Special Bitter."" If you're in Britain, however, and ask for that, the person tending bar is likely to give you a quizzical look. Over there it's usually just ""ESB."" 
 
If you ask anyone what that stands for, you'll be told, ""Extra Strong Bitter."" 
 
So why's it so ""special"" over here and ""strong"" over there? The answer is quite easy. 
 
Using ""strong"" as an adjective in a trade name or advertising for any alcoholic beverage in the U.S. would be a major no-no. Laws and regulations here provide that alcoholic content, as a percentage or ""proof"", must be printed on every label, but nothing else can be stated to puff it up, such as ""kicks like a mule"" or ""two shots of this and your troubles are over"". 
 
Moreover, in the US of A, we can't make any health claims for any alcohol. So, while ""Guiness is Good For You"" is an iconic slogan on the OTHER side of the pond, you'll never hear any such claim over here. 
 
So while beer contains no fat; is low in sugar; contains soluble fiber (a liter of beer contains 20% of your daily fiber needs); may reduce cholesterol levels (itself, it has none); moderate consumption of beer has been shown to reduce stress and the chances of heart disease; beer contains significant amounts of magnesium, selenium, potassium, phosphorus, biotin, and is chock full of B vitamins; and particularly real ale that hasn't been filtered may give you enough vitamin B to counteract a hangover...

747,TRUE,15,,Cambridge Brewing Company,450,"Experimental Beer/Sake hybrid
There is an old saying in Japan, ??There are ten thousand ways to make sake.??
CBC is very proud to introduce number ten thousand and one.

Banryu Ichi (10,001 ways in Japanese) is an experimental brew that straddles the line between beer and sake. Produced in collaboration with our good friend and masterful sake home-brewer, Todd Bellomy, this has been one of the most interesting and labor-intensive beers ever to come out of CBC.

We began last December by spending many cold, windy days in the alley behind the brewery, steaming rice in small batches to brew what became almost fifty gallons of pure sake. Sake is produced by multiple parallel fermentation: polished rice is converted to sugar by a fungus called Koji (Aspergillus oryzae) and fermentation is taken care of by sake yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae kyokai). After several weeks of fermentation this batch of sake (possibly the largest batch of sake ever made in New England) was destined to become the starter for our beer.

Just after Christmas, Todd joined us again to brew a mere six barrels of the craziest beer wort ever. Pale barley malt and flaked rice went into the mash, and after extracting only the first runnings we added a significant amount of brown rice syrup. This yielded a wort of 31*P/1.124SG, or in other words, some really thick, sticky stuff! The wort was sent to the fermenter and then, with fingers crossed, we pumped over the entire batch of sake including the yeast, Koji, and lots of rice slurry. Fermentation was slow and low at 50*F for six weeks, followed by cold-conditioning until it reached more than 15%abv!

Incredibly complex aromas and flavors abound, including sweet rice, fresh apples and grapes, hints of earth and mushroom from the koji, and as it warms further notes of fennel, herbs, and an almost Belgian-yeast spiciness. Brilliant copper-colored, it is full in body despite its very dry finish. This is one to be sipped, savored, and contemplated. Banryu Ichi is a truly unique beverage, served with intentionally very low carbonation in a 5oz. glass set inside a Masu, a traditional cedar sake cup.
Kampai!

There's not much we can do about the situation over there, but we're campaigning hard to raise awareness of this delicious table-strength beer on our side of the pond. There's nothing much ??mild?? about it, the term originally referred to fresh ale, as opposed to the aged, sour stuff. Check-out all the complex layers crammed into an unassuming session ale: aromas and flavours of husky cereal grains, freshly-baked brown bread and almost burnt toast, nutty, biscuity, caramelly, faint roastiness, earthy and citrusy English hops, distinctive fruity ale yeast esters. Well-rounded and almost chewy mouthfeel, yet somehow still a crisp and light impression, with hints of mineral water drawn from Old World artesian wells. Great aftertaste too, richer as it warms. You won't find a fresher example of the style, so please, spread the word! If it doesn't catch on like it did in 18th-Century England, I'll eat my rotary phone. Note: I will not eat my phone.

Miche Bread, which is owned and baked by Sandeep Gyawali, is truly delicious and inspiring. We felt an immediate kinship with Sandeep upon learning about his process. He mills his flour in-house using heritage grains, and he allows the bread to naturally leaven for several days with native yeast and bacteria, thereby creating all sorts of interesting flavors and aromas. Given our own use of Texas barley and wheat, and our spontaneous fermentation with native microbes, we knew we had to work with Sandeep somehow. Making a Kvass together seemed like a natural fit. Kvass is a low alcohol fermented beverage made with bread. It has been around in Eastern Europe for centuries.

We brewed Kvass with Sandeep at Jester King on July 19, 2016 with well water, malted barley from Blacklands Malt, malted rye, hops, and 140 pounds of Miche Bread in the mash. We then fermented the low gravity wort (1.023 / 6.0 Plato) in stainless steel with our mixed culture of brewers yeast, native yeast, and native bacteria. We then packaged Kvass on August 22, 2016 and allowed it to naturally referment in bottles and kegs. At the time of packaging, Kvass was 3.4 percent alcohol by volume, 25 IBU, 4.2 pH, and had a gravity of 1.002 (0.5 Plato). The label art was created by Josh Cockrell of Jester King.

DeScription

Drawing inspiration from these curious and intrepid voyagers, our brewers have created this rich, robust, deep-flavored ale. Despite its dark coffee-like hue and aromas of bourbon, dark fruit, and chocolate, this ale is deceivingly smooth with a rich malt character and subtly sweet finish. While our drinkers today may not have the same need to stave off scurvy, this hearty ale is one that can be enjoyed today, but also placed in the hold for years to come.

""Strong Yorkshire Ale"" 
Riggwelter is now our second best-selling bottled beer and has national listings in many of the major supermarkets. 
Aroma 
Roasted malt, hops and banana-fruit. 
Taste 
This strong, velvety ruby brown beer really is a wolf in sheep's clothing. It is deceptively clean drinking, with a wonderfully complex palate of coffee, bananas and liquorice which rewards you with a long, dry Goldings hop finish. 
Ingredients 
We use a base of Maris Otter malted barley, but add plenty of Pale Chocolate malt to give Riggwelter its rich dark colour, espresso nose and roasted malt flavours.
We use a touch of wheat which helps deliver the lovely creamy head and lacing down the glass - just what you would expect from a proper Yorkshire beer!
 
All our bottled ales are suitable for both vegetarians and vegans. 
What's in a name? 
Riggwelter Ale takes its name from a local Yorkshire Dales farming term which has Old Norse roots; ??rygg?? meaning back, and ??velte?? meaning to overturn. A sheep is said to be rigged or ??rigwelted??, when it has rolled onto its back and is unable to get back up without assistance.

Like us, Victory is one of the few brewers with an allegiance to whole-cone hops. They do extensive work with hop flavor, especially focusing on clever and delicious single-hop beers highlighting the same hop grown in different regions. They too share our roots in home brewing and never lost their passion for working with new beers and styles solely for the joy of making something new.    
Alt Route is our take on the old school German Altbier style featuring an ale-lager hybrid yeast, which is top fermenting and fruity like an ale, but matured at cool temperatures for a clean, lager-like flavor.

Som navnet antyder, er vores ??l en ??gte fusions??l, hvor vi med arme og ben har stj??let inspiration fra flere forskellige stilarter ?? og fra flere lande. 
 
G??ren, vi har brugt, er en klassisk tysk pilsnerg??r, som vi meget mod dens vilje har g??ret ved 22 grader celsius ?? en teknik man kender fra den amerikanske ??ltype ??California Common?? eller ??Steam Beer??. P?? den m??de kombinerer vi den spr??de friskhed fra lager??l med en portion frugtig friskhed, som man oplever i overg??ret ??l. 
 
Malten, vi bruger, er ikke noget ganske almindeligt valg, vi har grebet s??kken med engelsk Mild Ale malt, som giver ??llet sin, m??rke, ristede karakter, mens et par h??ndfulde tysk karamelmalt giver lidt s??dme og rundhed.
 
Og s?? ville det jo ikke v??re en rigtig Amager ??l, hvis ikke vi havde yderst gener??se med humlen. Her faldt vores valg p?? de klassiske amerikanske aromahumler Centennial, Chinook og Amarillo ?? I ved, s??dan nogen der masserer smagsl??gene. Og s?? efterlader disse humler den mest forn??jelige, citrusagtige friskhed. 
 
Er De forvirret? Jamen, det er der slet ingen grund til. Amager Summer Fusion er svaret til de mange, der i ??revis har spurgt: ??Hvorn??r f??r vi en amerikansk-engelsk tysk over-underg??ret pilsner-ale, der smager af en masse uden at man bliver bimmelim???

 Amager Summer Fusion er det officielle bidrag fra Amager Bryghus til konkurrencen p?? K??benhavnske ??ldage 2007 om at finde den perfekte sommer??l med max. 3,5% alkohol. 
 
 
ENGLISH: We wanted to prove that we could make a low alcohol beer rich in taste... and we named the outcome ""Fusion"". As the name indicates it is a true fusion beer due to the fact that our inspiration came from different styles and countries. The yeast is classic German pilsner yeast, which we - against its will, fermented at 71.6??F. This is a technique know from the American styles ""California Common"" a.k.a. ""Steam Beer"". Consequently, we were able to combine the crisp freshness from lager beers with a portion of the fruity freshness found in top fermented beers.
 
Our choice of malt is somewhat unusual as we selected an English Mild Ale malt adding a dark, roasted character to the beer, as well as a couple of handful of German caramel malt adding sweetness and a soft touch to the beer.
 
And it wouldn't be a true beer from Amager Bryghus, if we hadn't been generous with the hops. We chose classic American aroma hops such as Centennial, Chinook, and Amarillo - you know, the ones which really massages your taste buds. Additionally, these hops leave behind the most pleasurable, citric-like freshness.
 
Are you confused? No reason to be as our Fusion is the answer to the many people who over the years have asked for an American/English/German top and bottom fermented pilsner ale, which has lots of taste but is low on alcohol!

Inspired by the brewing tradition of our flagship, Anchor Steam?? Beer, Brotherhood Steam Beer is brewed with its own unique recipe. A distinct malt bill gives the beer its copper color, and dry-hopping with Citra and Nelson Sauvin hops adds aromatic hints of citrus and mint. The result is a smooth, full-bodied malt flavor with a lingering, fresh hop finish.

A long-standing English brewery tradition is to designate their beers, ??Ordinary??, ??Best or Special??, and ??Extra Special Bitter?? (ESB) to note beers of increasing strength.

In the spirit of that tradition, we like to think of Brotherhood Steam Beer as an Extra Special Lager (ESL), aka ??The Gig Beer?? ?? an easy drinking brew from the first set to encore. This collaborative brew will be tapped at music venues across the US to celebrate the Brotherhood's new album.

1860,TRUE,7.8,,Grand Teton Brewing Co.,234,"In Germany, strong lagers are called ??bocks?? or ??bock biers.?? There is some dispute over the origin of the designation. ??Bock?? in German also means goat, and that animal often appears on labels as a symbol of the style. Some say bocks are brewed for the season of Capricorn, which includes Christmas, while others say that the beer has the ??kick of a goat.??
 
The historically-minded among us at Grand Teton like to credit the style originators, the people of Einbeck, in northern Germany. The beers that gave Einbeck the nickname, ??City of Beer??, were first brewed in the 14th and 15th centuries. They were brewed very strong because they were sent long distances, fermenting on the way. Before long, Einbeck, pronounced Ein-bock by the southerners of Bavaria, became famous for its strong beers, which came to be known simply as ??bocks.??
 
Einbeck is a beautiful medieval city, architecturally distinctive for the one story--or taller--arches that grace each house. These arches allowed entry of the town brew kettle, which passed from house to house according to a lottery held each year on May 1st. A pale bock brewed to commemorate the lottery became the city's most celebrated beer??Maibock.
 
Our version is squarely in the Einbeck tradition. We used Idaho 2-Row Pale along with German Vienna and CaraHell malts for a clean, slightly sweet flavor, then subtly spiced the brew with German Tradition hops. We fermented with lager yeast from a monastery brewery near Munich and allowed it to ferment and condition for more than three months for a smooth yet crisp character.
 
Try Lazy Marmot Maibock as an aperitif to stimulate the taste buds, or with any flavorful fish, such as trout or salmon.

To give this classic beer a radically traditional twist, Brewmaster Scott Ungermann created Anchor Dry-Hopped Steam Beer. Made with its own special recipe, the brew is dry-hopped with a blend of new and traditional hops. The result weds the rich maltiness of Anchor Steam with an alluring fragrant hoppiness of our ales.

Anchor Dry-Hopped Steam Product Image??Anchor Dry-Hopped Steam Beer is both a historical nod to our roots and a cutting edge, modern beer,?? said Brewmaster Scott Ungermann. ??We took our most popular, classic beer and gave it a contemporary twist by introducing a lighter body and an elevated, dynamic hop profile using new and classic hop varieties. The result is a California Common with a unique hop bitterness balanced by a light malty sweetness.?? The original Anchor Steam Beer has rich caramel malt flavors balanced by an herbal hop spiciness. Anchor Dry-Hopped Steam Beer, on the other hand, has flavors of light malty sweetness with distinct aromas of citrus and stone fruit, and a lingering, bitter hop finish.

So we trialled three different unfined, dry-hopped versions of Merlin's Magic.

The beer was then laid down in ice filled caves until the following harvest in September and October, when it would be greatly enjoyed at harvest festivals. It emerged bronze and incomparably smooth with a round and slightly sweet palate, with an almost spicy flavor complemented by a deep toffee like aroma. The Marzen beer which means ""March Beer"", has an appetizing bitterness that serves to balance rather than challenge the malt underpinnings. At a strength of about 5.5-6.0 percent, it's a slightly stronger than Pilsner, but not as strong as a Bock beer. The balance between a bread like, malty, juicy sweetness and a firm bitterness makes traditional Marzen one of the most tantalizing of beers. The smoothness is created from extra long cold conditioning of 2-6 months!

This is not to suggest that complexity has been sacrificed, but rather that we seek to create clearer expressions of flavor and aroma in our beer, and ultimately to make beer that is balanced and drinkable.

Simple Means takes inspiration from Altbier. Though classically associated with the copper ales of D??sseldorf, the term can refer to any older-style beer in the German-speaking world. Both the use of smoked malts and mixed fermentation with native yeast and bacteria predate modern brewing techniques, lending flavors to our farmhouse altbier that are evocative of a simpler, much earlier time.

Simple Means was brewed with unfiltered, raw, Hill Country well water, malted barley, smoked malted barley, and hops in early September of 2015. It was fermented with our mixed culture of brewers yeast and native yeast and bacteria harvested from the air and wildflowers around our brewery in stainless steel for about two months. It was then 100% naturally conditioned through refermentation in the bottle for another two months prior to release.

It's because in the day, most beers were dark, unfiltered, even unsettling in appearance. That didn't matter, because ale was consumed in leather or stoneware vessels. 
 
With the the invention of glass, brewers were comelled to make beer that looked more appetizing. They found the answer in the use of isinglass, the swimbladder of sturgeon, which when dried, worked well to remove suspended solids in beer. 
 
Brewers then experimented with lighter hued ales to further enhance appearance.

A little lighter in body than Barley's Pale Ale, and just a wee more hops make this one a great year 'round session ale. 
 
Unfortunately, we only brew it once a year, in time for Saint Patrick's Day. It's an amber, though we wouldn't object if you called it a red ale. What better way to celebrate the life of the patron Saint of Ireland? Certainly not with green beer. 
 
Shall we attempt to guess how this umm, tradition started? 
 
First, it couldn't have been in Ireland. There, traditionally Guinness is the drink of choice on St Patricks Day. Would the Irish really foul good beer with green dye? Besides, it would be pretty difficult to dye black beer green, wouldn't you agree? 
 
The Germans have been known to put colored liqueurs into their wheat beers (Berliner anyone?), but they don't celebrate Saint Patty's Day, do they? They've got their own fish to fry--Oktoberfest. 
 
OK, so that leaves someone in the good ole USA as the probable perpetrator. Some person, most likely not Irish at all, decided to desecrate beer in the name of St. Patrick. Real classy. 
 
Then with plenty of help from slimy news types and big corporation breweries, it took off. Now it's a part of American holiday tradition. Which is of course, take something and change it into something opposite of what it used to be. 
 
It helps when there is a excuse to drink. Any excuse to drink is the sure fire bet into American tradition. Like football and NASCAR and beer pong.

""Havtorn ?? Nordens citroner. Det ??r f??rmodligen det av alla jordens b??r som inneh??ller flest vitaminer i stor m??ngd."" 
 
?? N??r Mathias Dahlgren och jag satt under ett av v??ra m??ten och pratade god mat och dryck, som vi g??r f??r det mesta n??r vi tr??ffas, kom vi in p?? v??r gemensamma f??bless f??r den asiatiska k??ket, s??ger Jessica Heidrich. 
 
?? Han sl??ngde fram id??n om att g??ra ett ??l som passar till det heta och syrliga fr??n lime, koriander och chilli men med en klar svensk twist. De drycker som passar b??st till asiastisk mat har ofta en l??tt syra eller citruston, som belgisk vete??l, och utpr??glad fruktighet, som till exempel sake eller ett Rieslingvin. 
 
?? Sj??lvklart gick v??ra tankar genast till att g??ra ett ??l med v??ra svenska sm?? citroner, det vill s??ga havtornen, mycket aromatiska och h??ga i syra. Det blev ett ofiltrerat fruktigt ??l med h??g syra (men inget frukt??l), som bryggs p?? pilsnermalt f??r att ge utrymme ??t smaken fr??n havtornen. Humlen best??r av amerikansk Simcoe vars citrustoner f??rst??rker fr??sch??ren och syran fr??n b??ren. 
 
 Doft och smak

Anchor Steam?? Beer owes its deep amber color, thick, creamy head, and rich, distinctive flavor to a historic brewing process like none other.

It is a process that combines deep respect for craft brewing tradition with many decades of evolution to arrive at a unique approach: a blend of pale and caramel malts, fermentation with lager yeast at warmer ale temperatures in shallow open-air fermenters, and gentle carbonation in our cellars through an all-natural process called kr??usening. 

Anchor Steam?? Beer derives its unusual name from the 19th century when ??steam?? was a nickname for beer brewed on the West Coast of America under primitive conditions and without ice. While the origin of the name remains shrouded in mystery, it likely relates to the original practice of fermenting the beer on San Francisco's rooftops in a cool climate. In lieu of ice, the foggy night air naturally cooled the fermenting beer, creating steam off the warm open pans. Once a nickname for any Californian or West Coast beer brewed under these conditions, today the name ??steam?? is a trademark of Anchor Brewing and applies only to the singular process and taste of our flagship brand - San Francisco's original Anchor Steam?? Beer.

In contrast to the punchy, dark Ola Dubhs aged in casks from the wild isles of Orkney, Orach Slie is a much lighter, easy-going beer that reflects the softer, sweeter malts of Glenfarclas which nestles in the rolling Speyside moors of Banffshire. Having trialled a variety of different beers, the brewers settled on a lightly-hopped, high-abv version of Schiehallion to perfectly complement the classic, honeyed-sherry malts of Glenfarclas.
 
Orach Slie pours a light straw colour and immediately displays a delicate malty character on the nose. It has a surprisingly robust, chewy mouthfeel that belies its light appearance, coating the palate with gentle-sweetness which in turn gives way to a pleasantly-bitter, drying (and slightly tangy) finish.",,"https://res.cloudinary.com/ratebeer/image/upload/w_120,c_limit/beer_257910.jpg",,Harviestoun Orach Slie,112,66,FALSE,Special,Premium Lager,94,/beerstyles/premium-lager/103/,[whiskey barrel],/beer/harviestoun-orach-slie/257910/,3.3

Ironically named indeed, as in this case to remain in light would be to perpetuate appreciation of perhaps the most maligned beer style in the craft brewing world, the American Light Lager. Further, its name is an obvious reference to one of the late 20th Century's greatest albums by Talking Heads. A groundbreaking record, it pushed musical boundaries by blending American punk, funk, and early rap with Afrobeat's polyrhythms and lyrical inspiration from African literature, improvisation, and the cut-up method developed by Brion Gysin and Gil Wolman. Psychoanalyst Michael A. Brog called its front cover a ??disarming image, which suggests both splitting and obliteration of identity?? and which introduces the listener to the album's recurring theme of ??identity disturbance.??
 
Lest you fear the CBC Brew Crew is suffering a similar identity crisis, rest assured that we have full control of our faculties. The simple truth is that these beers are remarkably easy to drink and perfect for enjoying as we ride the cusp of summer-into-autumn weather. Moreso, while light lagers may be easy to create in the purpose-built industrial breweries across the land, they are very challenging to produce on a small-scale system like ours. And we are always up for a challenge.
 
Remain In Light is brewed with pilsner malt and flaked rice, hopped with Styrian Goldings, Saaz and Hallertauer, and fermented cold and lagered with the famous lager yeast from Augustiner. Bitterness and body are intentionally higher than typically found in those beers made by our macro contemporaries. Clean malty cereal grain sweetness is delicate but noticeable, while spicy herbal hop notes spread across the palate and linger through a bracing bitter finish. Our choice of serving glass, a 12 oz. flute, serves to keep the beer colder while preparing you for the second round. Hold this beer up to the light and ask yourself, ??Where does that highway lead to???

In 1876, thanks to an ice pond in the mountains and a belief that anything is possible in the Golden State, a little brewery named Boca created California's first genuine lager. Anchor California Lager?? is our re-creation of this historic American beer.

Made in San Francisco with two-row California barley, Cluster hops (the premier hop in 19th-century California), and our own lager yeast, this all-malt brew is kr??usened and lagered in our cellars. Its golden color, distinctive aroma, creamy head, balanced depth of flavor, and smooth finish make Anchor California Lager?? a delicious celebration of California's unique craft brewing heritage.

The California grizzly bear on our Anchor California Lager?? label is from a woodcut by Durbin Van Vleck (1833??1898), courtesy of The Bancroft Library, UC Berkeley. First published in 1856 in San Francisco, it is a superbly crafted rendering of an original illustration by Charles Christian Nahl (1818??1878), who had painted both eastbound and westbound versions of this bear. Nearly a century later, Nahl's bear served as inspiration for the design of the bear on California's modern state flag.

Thanks for the inspiration D.O.A.. ?? like your music, we think great beer can also change the world. 

History & Style 
Malt liquor is a North American beer style defined by its high alcohol content and general easy drinkability. Typically made with cheaper sugar sources such as rice or corn, the original beer-in-a-paper-bag malt liquor is an emblem of hard living. The Beau's brew team offers up a high-quality organic barley malt / cane sugar interpretation in Hardcore 8.1. 

Tasting Notes 
A classy, certified organic interpretation of the iconic malt liquor style, Hardcore 8.1 is a deep golden-coloured lager that mingles malt and fruit notes in three-chord harmony with honey-like elements. The aroma is fruity suggesting citrus and apricot. The finish offers a hi-test alcohol warmth that resonates like a final guitar lick.

The lager has a clean, dry finish with some mild fruitiness delivered by the US version of German Hallertau hops and traditional Polish Lublin.  What is a Dortmunder Lager Style you say?

In the mid-19th century, breweries in Dortmund, Germany began brewing a common style of lager that was slightly stronger in alcohol, and that sought a balance between classic German noble hops and the sweetness of pale malts. Where the classic pilsner offered a more pronounced hop aroma and character, the Dortmunder lager offered a firm and even dryness with a slightly alcoholic warmth. The export version of the Dortmunder lager was noticeably higher in alcohol content. At 5.5% alc./vol. it is stronger than many lagers in the North American market. Compared to mainstream lagers, it is a more full-bodied and less gaseous edition of the lager style. We think it's delicious - we hope you do too. Food Pairing 
This pale golden lager pairs very well with fish, chicken, burgers and salads. A good choice to take along to a summer barbecue or a camping adventure.  Our Can

Before THBC fell victim to the rampant consolidation that characterized the beer industry during the latter half of the century, the brewery covered several square blocks of the city. Today, only a few of the original structures still stand - ancient bricks, blocks and beams where the strength and scale of the brewery is still apparent. 

Our brewers were inspired by the handwritten 1901 recipe notes of THBC assistant brewer, Walter Braun. True to most pre-Prohibition American pilseners, CV continues to brewed with corn and malted barley and showcases both Cluster and Tettnang hops.  Cluster was the predominant American-grown hop in the Midwest at the turn of the century, and the Braun family came to the U.S. from the Tettnang region of Germany.
