164,"2016-03-20",4.1,"This is a fantastic porter, one of the best ones Ive had in quite a while. Its a credit to the Maine Beer Companys ability to understate that they arent billing this as an ""imperial"" porter. They could certainly get away with that qualifier. This beer pours black with a head that leave spotty lace. The aroma is licorice, some chocolate, dark roasted coffee, and some hop tingle. The flavor is strong, bitter, deep roasted malt and a little hint of citrus hop on the finish. Mouthfeel is somewhat thick.

164,"2016-01-17",3.7,"There is an initial burst of beautiful baking cocoa, dark chocolate, and sweet caramely malts, spiced up with herbal, aromatic, slightly piney hops that really sets the bar really high for the rest of the experience. Somehow the aroma dies down a bit after this, and all this greatness is dulled down into soft chocolate malts. On the tongue, though, this beer is a pleasure through and through: the mouthfeel is velvety smooth, of medium viscosity and prickly effervescence; the taste is medium bitter and chocolaty sweet, with beautiful cocoa flavors and a dry, lightly ashy, earthy aftertaste. Maybe I was having a bad sinus day, or maybe I need a fresher bottle. But Im convinced this is even better than what I was able to appreciate.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

164,"2015-12-06",3.3,"500 mL bottle shared by ebone1988. Thanks! The pour is a nice brown, dark, with a lighter tan head and a lingeringly soapy lace. The aroma is surprisingly hoppy. There is a big roast and a nice chocolate on the back end. The malts really come in about half way through and carries out the finish. The flavor is pretty decent. There is a roast, and a light chocolate to go with a hint of nuttiness. Other than that, it leaves a lot to be desired. The mouth feel is thin and watery with a light carbonation, but it's just not that great. Another disappointment from MBC. Damnit.

Deeply roasted dark malt aroma thats smokey and burnt, verging on becoming acrid and one dimensional. Lots of ash, charcoal and burnt toast along with some oatmeal and spent coffee grinds. As it warms, it opens up a bit with notes of toffee, caramel and dark chocolate but the strong burnt roast character still dominates. 

On the fuller end of medium bodied and thankfully more flavorful and complex than the nose suggests. There is still a very dry roast flavor that dominates things but it isnt harsh or completely overbearing. Slightly smokey with some charcoal, burnt malt, oatmeal and espresso bean but this is countered mid-palate by a subtle lactic cream presence as well as some dessert like chocolate sweetness. Hints of sweet and dark chocolate as well as some toffee, caramel and hazelnut. Theres also a slight gourmet coffee character without tasting like an overwhelming coffee beer. Really well balanced yet retains enough roast to make it bold and the ABV is very well masked. A complex, intense take on the style that remains an enjoyable drink.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

So I brought it up stairs cracked it open and poured half the bottle in a bowl with 1lb of ground beef, 1lb of ground pork, some basil, fennel, salt and pepper to taste. Any way I then drank the final half of the bottle directly out of the bottle while standing over the grill cooking these burgers up. Burgers turned out fantastic.

Very nice nose of roast, chocolate and a light airy citric hop note.

Full bodied, almost to the point of thickness, with a rich creamy texture. Normal carbonation with a hint of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.

The very good flavor profile is intense, slightly complex and somewhat balanced. It begins with a burst of roast that slowly yields to coffee coupled with a hoppy bitterness. The middle brings a caramel sweetness that is detectable, but fails to balance. As the finish occurs, alcohol is rather evident.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

Nice balance of some earthy hops in the flavor with a kiss of bitterness. Roasted malts lead the way with a large semi-bitter chocolatey tone. Subtle notes of licorice, cacao, soy, & figs hang in the periphery. Getting a lot more coffee bean in the flavor as well, more towards the finish. Not really sweet, but not overly bitter, either, so the balance is pretty solid. Medium-thick body with a substantial creaminess.

Well, I always say Porters arent my favourite style, but this one mounts a pretty decent challenge to that position. Nice complexity on the nose and tongue, restrained but sufficient hop bittering, just enough sweetness to temper the dark roasted coffee/chocolate tones, and enough body to carry it off. The moderately high ABV is also integrated very nicely, and is barely noticeable as a mild warming. That being said, Im not entirely sold on the sharpness in the nose, and wonder if this could use some cellar time to mellow - notwithstanding the bottle recommendation to drink within 90 days of bottling.

164,"2014-08-11",4.5,"I poured a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. I was bottled on 7/22/14 and cost $6 ($0.36 per ounce).

Appearance: Opaque midnight black body. Pours to a huge, dark tan, frothy head which laces and retains extremely well.

Smell: Fairly typical porter aroma of dark malt with significant sweetness. A hint of dairy.

Taste: Theres a certain je na sais quois quality to the Robust Porter style, and Maine Beer Companys King Titus not only has that quality, but seems to exemplify it. Ive had many beers in the style before, but this just might the best. Its got everything a great porter should have: plenty of dark malt character and sweetness with some roasted barley flavor along with significant, but restrained, hop bitterness. 

Right away theres a deep sensation of dark malty wort; milk chocolate, oats, a hint of black cherry. The flaked oats are quite noticeable here, and probably account for the milk chocolate flavors, and give it a light sweetness thats not cloying. Hops are quite strong as well. A dry bitterness that rides shotgun from beginning to end, but really makes itself known right on the finish. A delicious combination of slight herbal/earthy hop flavor and bittersweet chocolate and roasted malt. In fact, its probably a little overly-hopped for the style, but Maine Beer seems to like their brews that way. The result is a versatile palette that works great as a standalone beverage, with a savory meal, or with (or as) dessert.

Drinkability: As delicious as the taste is here, what really seals the deal is the drinkability. The mouthfeel is thick, but not sticky or cloying. Theres calmness to the body, though its in no way flat. The silky smooth texture makes it almost ridiculously easy to get down. At 7.5% ABV its the best of both worlds: the robustness of a big, beefy brew but without any obese, boozy qualities.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Thanks to buffalohead for sharing this one evening. A robust porter was a good representation of what a local brewery can do. I couldnt see this succeeding on a larger scale but Maine Beer is not the worst local to have if you live on the East Coast.

Aroma / Appearance - The black base retains reddish edges and mild carbonation. Sheer legs crawl up and down. Oily raspberries, low key chocolate, and fruity undertones spring up from the glass.

Flavor / Palate - Chocolates, raspberries, and dark fruits cling to the tongue. Malt and ash carry to a reasonably coherent finish. The chalky texture that sticks in the throat afterwards highlights a sound recipe. While this may not stand up to the best porters it is worth a couple of ounces at least.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Lasting impressions: Well it is a porter so the thinner mouth feel can be forgiven, ultimately quite grainy from the wheat husks and really it is good but yep, it is not $8 good. As Matt stated, I can find a lot of porters locally every bit its equal if not better.

Hope this beer is as highly valuable as the $8 price tag. Pours near black with a broken sheet of light mocha foam. Smells of toasted malts, coffee, some bitter cocoa, some raisin, some leather and soil and a bit of resiny hops. Flavor is dry with coffee, dark toasted malts, some more leather, some dirt, some bitterness, some bits of maduro tobacco. Fairly thin for the style with low carb and a dry finish - not sure this leaves me disappointed, but its certainly different for the style.

164,"2013-09-29",3.3,"500 ml bottle served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass. Bottled 4/23/13.

A: Pours a solid black color and as with all Maine Beer Co. beers a thick and heavy head, khaki in color, forms on the pour and sticks around for quite some time. Great retention. Lots of sticky webbing of lace is left on the glass.

S: The hops pop up in the forefront with some light fruitiness. Some roast and char is present after the initial hop burst. Light cocoa powder as well.

T: Some leafy and fruity hops up front. The char and roast take over in the mid-palate, but the hops definitely stick around throughout. Light bitter bakers chocolate mixes with some sweet roasted malts on the finish.

M: medium bodied with a nice chew to the body. Medium carbonation with a roasty and sweet finish.

O: Im not the biggest fan of hoppy porters. The hops lingered a little too long for me and provided some unwanted fruity and leafy notes while not adding any bitter flavors. There is enough chocolate malts with a nice roasting to remind its still a porter, but it needs a little more balance.

Feel: Full body, tight fizzy carbonation, this time it fits like a fine Belgian ale. Overall: I dont know why I havent tried this before. This isnt the ""Buckets full of Hops"" that M.B.C. are used to contributing to their beers. This is tasty and also walks the thin line of being an Imperial Porter. Dont get me wrong about the hops. It doesnt lack them either. Like a fine Belgian beer, the hops arent in for flavoring. They are used for the dryness of the flavor and bitterness to cut the sweetness ( which does a fine job at that). This beer is rock solid.

Lighter, crisp, lightly soft carbonation, with a more dry finish. Good chewiness to the body. Nice bigger bitter hoppy taste, light sweetness. Very hoppy, for a porter.. Some resin, pine, spicy and citrus hops. Big bitter very dark chocolate, light roast, some oats. Just a very light bite to the taste, is the only fault I can find for this.

164,"2013-04-25",3.6,"In short: A creamy and hoppy porter with a bit of many things.  Good.
How: Bottle 500ml, consumed fresh a little more than one month after bottling date.
The look: Near black body topped by a large tan head with medium retention leaving lots of lacings on the glass.
In long: Nose is relatively hoppy (for the style) with pine-tree & wood resin almost dominating the burnt toasts and coffee.  Taste is burnt black cake, molasses, vanilla, tree sap, some baked dark fruits, some fresh tobacco.  A solid woody/coniferous bitterness that doesnt go overboard, this is a well balanced beer.  Body is thick and somewhat oily giving a motor-oil sensation.  I really cant find anything wrong with this beer (it is a Main Brewery beer after all) but yet the whole thing just didnt win me over like most Maine Brewery beers do, it was only good.  Overall, a good beer from this fine brewery who give back a portion of their sales to environmental groups around the world, these guys make me feel guilty for all the water I have wasted pretending to wash my hands after going to the washroom because there are people around.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Finish: smooth and nicely dry, with lingering dark chocolate and piney hops vying for attention.   Notes: Ive been on a major porter kick over the last few weeks, and darned if this is isnt the greatest porter Ive ever had.  Big, rich, chocolatey, and bittersweet, with a chewy but not overpowering palate.  Hops all over the place, but they add just the right amount of aroma and bitter character without overpowering or making it a hop-bomb.  I would drink this every darn day.  Phenomenal.

The flavor is also more hop forward that a classic porter with bitter chocolate, tangy espresso, stronger roast, and bitter finish.  The mouthfeel is a standout. Its full and lively with a heavy citric linger.  Its certainly a great beer but goes more towards an American stout than I prefer in a porter, American and Robust or not.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","bmerz"

Some lightly speckled lacing appeared around the sides of the pint glass. No carbonation was seen rising due to the dark body, only one ring at the top of the pint glass, I like it. The smell had the coffee up front with some light tobacco chocolate in the background. The taste was basically the same, nothing really different.

164,"2013-01-16",4.2,"Bottled December 30, 2012.
Appearance: What a beautiful looking porter, the thick and foamy brown head leaves a thick layer of foamy lacing as it slowly dissipates, the lacing almost looks as if theres still head there. The head settles into a foamy coating that sits on the black body, brown is seen through the edges though.
Aroma: Sweet cocoa is the first thing that comes to mind which is balanced really well with a roasted coffee aroma, hints of caramel support the cocoa and roasted aromas.
Taste: Roasted coffee and dark chocolate are strong and intense right away on the intro giving an unassuming bitterness that shocked me after smelling the aroma. On the next sip the flavor are a tad mellow and I can pick up some light caramel flavors, but the dark chocolate and coffee are the primary flavors here.
Palate: Velvety smooth and thick body with no carbonation to note in the body.
Overall: This is an excellent porter that is well worth the price of admission. This is perhaps one of the best porters Ive ever had. The body really sets this off for me, its so thick and velvety, well done.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Aroma: The nose is roasted malts, chocolate, pine hops, toffee, and some earth

Appearance: Pours a dark brown-black color with a thick, creamy brown head that leaves lots of lace

Flavor: The taste is malty up-front, not super sweet, mostly roasty, with a later dry-roasted bitterness

Palate: The body is medium-full, it feels creamy and smooth, with a fairly soft carbonation, and a dry finish

Overall Impression: 
This one is right up there with the best Porters I can remember trying.  The mix of roasted malts and hops works well, and exemplifies exactly what this style is capable of.

Toasty coffee  malt aroma with a touch of vanilla and a faint pumpernickel accent. Opaque brown with clear ruby-brown highlights under a ruddy, light brown blanket that lasts and laces the glass. Full toasty pumpernickel and tangy semi-sweet chocolate flavour with vanilla coffee and faint dried fruit. Full body, moderate to medium carbonation, tangy chocolate finish. Balance is on the sweet side, but the tang and a gentle bitterness are providing a decent amount of balance.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

164,"2012-11-21",3.7,"Ive enjoyed the majority of beers that Ive had from Maine brewing, so hearing that this was a part of a recent trade I was pretty excited.  Deep brown in color with a nice khaki head.  Looks promising.  Aroma has tobacco and chocolate.  Pretty damn hoppy for a porter.  Chocolate, light grapefruit, tobacco, and a dry finish.  Damn solid offering from Maine again.","Minnesota, USA","mattyb83"

Pours dark blackish brown with big fluffy, well-retained tan head.  Nose is roasty black patent and choc malts, big hops, cacao.  Tastes medium in palate heft, with choc and munich malts, hops, some sweetness from the cacao, and a complex roasty finish.  This one ends with a huge amount of lacing on the glass.

Nose and flavor bring a lovely combination of creamy vanilla and chocolate sweetness, roasted bitterness, and dank, resinous evergreen hops.

164,"2012-11-03",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2013 My Bottom Line:
Toasted bread flavors meet coniferous hop resins in this portly Robust Porter with fruity edges.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A rich head of foam tops the blackness.
-Carbonation is soft and expansive.
-Sweetness makes this brew feel heavier than it is. The lax finish, where wet bread, coffee and roast dominate, accentuates this impression of heft.
-Hops arent super bright even though they are initially intense.
-Hop aroma is quite complex though, in the forest-y range (wood, leaves, resins).

164,"2012-10-31",4.0,"A new MBC offering? Yea instant buy for me. Plus everyone loves gorillas. Like everything Maine does it is the dictionary definition of a classic style. A porter with deep dark body and tan head. Aroma of chocolate roasted with touch or coffee foam. Taste is mild sweet with pine bitter and coffee acridness. Body is full without being heavy. A beer I could drink for days.",", Massachusetts, USA","TheGent"
164,"2012-10-31",3.7,"500mL Bottle. Opaque chocolate sauce and burnt barbeque ends mash with fig jam and barrel char. Much silkier and lighter than the aroma lets on. A fluffy body brings a light lick of acid to a pretty big cocoa powder show. Earnest and clean, but seemingly a touch light on the dark malt complexity. Alcohols perk up a dry finish, that has a cottony sensation to it. The body seems light and airy for a 7.5% porter. Fantastic brewing no doubt, but maybe not the flavor-bomb show stopper Ive come to expect from Maine Beer Co.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

164,"2012-10-24",2.9,"Very dark brown, not black pour covered by an initially large, but fading beige head. Very hoppy nose - like anything coming from Maine Brewing Co it seems, where juicy citrus meets acidic oily resin and distort the burnt chocolate cake maltiness. The sharply acidic combination between the roasted malts and citric hops feel detrimental to the seemingly layered and deep malt complexity. As is always the case with this brewer, the palate feels round, filling with unfiltered goodness yet never hindering drinkability thanks to among other things, an engaging carbonation. Very bitter finish with plenty of citrusy, piney hops and fruity dark chocolate intricacies. While alcohol does not constitute a major factor, it felt to me like this beer, despite its many strong points, was too intense and not very balanced on the acidity/bitterness axis. Ill still try anything they put out, but am definitely looking far more toward the pale than dark ales.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
