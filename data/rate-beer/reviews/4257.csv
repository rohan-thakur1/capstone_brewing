Tasted juicy ripe mango, orange citrus tones and a slight piney touch from the hops. Medium carbonation, this really is a juice bomb of a beer that is packed with fruity flavors and so easy to drink.","SWEDEN","ngeaney"

4257,"2015-08-01",3.3,"Bottle from Vinmonopolet, Oslo. Golden/orange colour, slightly hazy. White, sticky head that leaves a band of lacing and a stable thick film. Intensely fruity-vegetal aroma with mango, pumpkin and a whiff of nearly-rotten vegetables. Taste is (thankfully) much fresher, with cider and orange juice associations. Mild acidity and bitterness, well-balanced. Medium body, lively-soft carbonation. Not an immediate favourite, potentially a grower.","NORWAY","berlinoise2go"

4257,"2015-05-22",3.2,"Bottle. Pours golden, with a big creamy head. Aroma has initial whiffs of sharp herbs, forest and juniper, before lots of sweet mango juice and a hoppy fruitiness follows, backed by ever so slight notes of sweet roasted malts. Creamy body, with soft carbonation. Flavour is sweet hops, with peaches, mango and floral notes, as well as tropical juice and sweet malts with toffee. Sweet fruity finish, with a mild herbal touch. Even though it is rather unusual and indistinct, it¬ís still quite nice. All the sweetness, from both hops and malts, as well as the added mango makes it all a bit overpowering though.","Bergen, NORWAY","tmrmwel"

4257,"2015-01-08",3.3,"750 ml bottle @ Kick. Unclear golden body with a nice off-white head. Aroma is very refreshing with mango and other citric fruits, some orange, mild caramel malt and spicy yeast. Flavor has sweet malt, but all the fruit flavors dominate immediately and camouflages all other flavors for the first sips. Then the fruit almost seems to partly disappear and the malt, caramel with spices and some bitterness appears. The whole flavor is a bit unusually for me, everything feels very refreshing and fruity and then almost disappears and what¬ís left is not too impressive. Might have something to do with the beer not being too fresh anymore, the bitterness is actually a bit harsh and aftertaste feels slightly sticky. Well the price for this beer in Norway is ridiculous, but I shouldn¬ít hold that against anyone as I know this is not a part of a regular import but more than less made available for the few extra interested customers. Anyway nice to have sampled it, probably much nicer when served fresh, but not too impressive today.","Kristiansand, NORWAY","Beer5000"
4257,"2014-12-25",4.1,"I had trouble deciding how to rate this, I¬íll try to narrate the whole experience. First pour, golden, foamy into my Spaten tulip. Nose was rich with a combo of mango, spicy and citrus hops, didn¬ít get the juniper unless it was part of the spice of what I thought was hops. I loved it right then, was thinking it might be a 4.5 rating, but then on the first sip I was a bit let down. The body seemed flat, thin, more bitter citrus and mango, than hoppy, again no juniper that I could easily discern. But as I worked my way through the 750, this beer grew and grew on me, sure a little more liveliness in the palate and carbonation would help it but I guess in the end, I liked it quite a bit.

4257,"2014-11-15",3.6,"Bottle, 75cl, at Kick. It pours a clear golden body under a nice looking off-white head. Lots of mango on the nose, with a touch of pine cones. Citrus and a generic fruityness. Very smooth on the palate, quite dry. Subtle bitterness in the flavor, lots of fruityness, mango mostly. Sort of dry, but with a fruity sweetness. A bit low on bitterness perhaps. Full body, very soft on the palate. Lasting fruity finish. Not much impact from the juniper at any point. A very tasteful and pleasant beer, but it fails to raise my eyebrows and go wow. 141115","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
