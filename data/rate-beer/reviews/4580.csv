4580,"2016-05-23",3.3,"Tap at Beermongers. 2014 vintage. 

A: Cloudy gold with a thin white head. Light lacing. 

N: Vinegar, oak, coriander, clove, melon, lemon zest, grapefruit, some sulfur and stomach acid, unfortunately, sweet-tarts, and oranges. 

T: Pleasingly tart and a bit sweet. 

M: No alcohol, light body, crisp carbonation. 

O: Hasnt aged particularly well, I guess. Though, I havent had it fresh; this doesnt have the typical potency of an aged Block 15 beer, but then again, it doesnt have the cultures of their stunners, so fairs fair, I guess.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

4580,"2014-09-10",3.7,"Poured from tap to glass. Hazy muddy orange hue with fizzy white head that dissipated to a thin ring. Aroma is lactic, wheat, peppercorn, peach, cherry, straw. Mouthfeel is refreshing with a light body and sharp carbonation. Taste is dry sweetness followed by a tart sourness that extends through the finish. Overall this is a nice sour wit.","Sweet Home, Oregon, USA","Salmoniform"
4580,"2013-12-29",3.6,"Had on draft at Baileys. The aroma is slightly soapy, lemon, apple. There is a nice malty sweetness, lemon, peppery. There is a nice tartness/acidity to this beer. The finish is dry. Not bad.","Bountiful, Utah, USA","Gription79"
4580,"2013-12-28",3.9,"On tap at Baileys, pours a hazy golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out sour cherries, red wine barrels, and a little Belgian white. Flavour brings out loads of sour fruit tarts, lush red wine notes, and some slight notes of coriander. Extremely well-balanced, with a very dry vinous palate. Excellent stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
4580,"2013-06-20",4.9,"So sour and lemony on the nose. Smooth, puffy, some vanilla. this is one of the most drinkable sours I have ever had. Some light nut, huge vanilla and fresh grain. Gooseberry in a big way. Good lord that is tasty.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Alphadelic"
4580,"2012-12-21",4.0,"On draught at Baileys Taproom. Nice souring from the yeast. Great wheat aftertaste.  Almost like a sour cereal, to paraphrase the bartender.","Oregon, USA","pdx77"
4580,"2011-09-12",3.6,"9 months in Pinot Noir barrels? whew!  Gold, hazy and slightly cloudy.  Moderate lactic sour in aroma with only slight corianter/orange peel scent.  Flavor is clean light-to-moderate sourness, touch of malt, little or no spice.  Very good and refreshing.  light bodied despite slight grainy malt flavor.","Providence, Rhode Island, USA","PapaSkeetSkeet"
4580,"2011-09-08",3.6,"Nose of corriander, light wheat, lemons, orange, some funky lactic notes, light wine barrel. Nice interesting, but still showing more wit beer in my opinion than any of the other funky stuff there. Pours hazy yellow orange, thin fizzy white.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
