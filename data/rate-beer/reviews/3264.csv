3264,"2015-05-30",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2016 The last of the current Achel trappists I hadnt tasted yet, apparently only sold at the abbey in 75 cl bottles and the follow-up to Achelse Zomer, a wonderful brew I bought in 2004, which was a one-off made for the abbotts birthday; this version is slightly different, more dry and stronger. Since I remember Achelse Zomer quite well despite it being eleven years, I am very interested in how this one relates to its predecessor. Big, towering, foamy, frothy, off-white, dense, lacing head (even very slight gushing), colour hazy golden blonde with a peachy hue and fierce, champagne-like fizz; turns a murky brownish peach with deposit. Strong Belgian yeast aroma of Conférence pear, green plum, hint of banana, fresh pineapple, white bread, dough, vague suggestion of crushed peppermint leaves, whisky, roasted pine nuts, soap, subtle honey accent, flowers, but some wet paper as well, bit phenolic. Powerful onset of unripe fruits, green plum, pear, some green banana and berries, citric freshness (a little bit sourish), with a very strong, minerally, drying carbonation tantalising the tongue - for a tripel, after all a well-carbonated style in most cases, this seems even a bit overcarbonated. Lovely bready and eventually even honeyish malt sweetness ensues, perhaps some white candi syrup sweetness too, very light toasted touch to it, while the spicy yeastiness persists, becoming clove- or even slightly mint-like in the end; full but smooth mouthfeel. Finishes in nicely lingering bready malt sweetness and estery fruitiness, along with a fair dosis of leafy, lightly peppery hop bitterness, retronasal soapy phenols and warming but nowhere disturbing, jenever- or even lightly whisky-like booze. In all: more than decent, the trappist quality stamp is all over it, but it seems to lack some personality in comparison with e.g. Westmalle Tripel or Chimay Triple. Hoppier and more warming than the regular Achel 8 Blond, but a bit more coarse as well due to the high carbonation; in comparison with the original Achelse Zomer of 2004, this is a bit of a disappointment, as it lacks the lush, baroque fruit exuberance which gave Achelse Zomer its distinctive character. Still, the dry-hopping worked well here, this is a good tripel by all means.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

3264,"2014-02-02",3.6,"Nous voici devant le paradoxe dAchel... A savoir, dans les bières brunes, on suit la progression
normale : lextra brune est supérieure à la brune. Mais pour les blondes, la blonde de 8 est vraiment
supérieure à lextra blonde que voici.
Pourtant, celle-ci présente un niveau abv de 9,5 %, et donc lespoir dune bière plus ample.
La bouteille 75 cl malheureusement nest pas bouchonnée (!!!) mais seulement capsulée	
Premier point négatif. Second point, la couleur dun doré plutôt pâle, et surtout labsence de bulles
et de mousse !!! (et pourtant mon exemplaire est à date en août 2014...).
Les arômes sont de blé, fruits blancs, fleurs daubépine, pointe de Sancerre.
1ère bouche au volume doux, souple, sur les céréales, le houblon et une herbe aromatique.
Arrière-bouche fraîche mais forte.
2ème bouche où se dirige vers les grands vins blancs secs.
3ème que je qualifierais de liqueur brassée avec une grande finesse.
Arrière-bouche très lisse.
La longueur est un modèle de suavité, avec de lampleur. Cest un peu une infusion de malts...
Quelques pointes de miel aussi.
La levure est fluide, douce, mais na pas le niveau dune grande trappiste, et certainement pas
le niveau de sa petite sur la blonde de 8.
Lalcool est bien dosé évidemment, il épanouit le breuvage.
La finale nous laisse sans trop de différence avec la longueur.... donc déçu !!
Conclusion : bière très originale, mais complètement hors référence connue...

côté des chênes liège... Sa finale est vraiment faible.","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"
