4536,"2017-04-22",4.1,"Draft at Duckfat. Pours golden with a white head. Leaves a lot of lacing in the jar. Has a nice grass note on the nose. Pretty grassy on the tongue as well. Finished clean. Very nice.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
4536,"2017-04-04",3.9,"Draught at Townshend, 2/11/17.Good clarity in this sparklingly-carbonated, pale-flaxen blonde beer. White head atop is medium-sized and dense.Light cereal grains in the nose mix with dusty hops, a touch of lemon-lime and plenty of fresh grass. Clean, seemingly well-attenuated from the nose and with delicate hints of honey and buttercream (not diacetyl-induced). Hops are a little more prominent than in a traditional pilsner, but not by much and I assume its more due to the relative freshness than any intention to Americanize this thing (also they are still Noble hop-like in character).Dry, lightly grainy with tight carbonation, tons of lemon and fresh grass and dainty cereal grains on the finish. A bit of sweat, sawdust and dust is the only detractor, though Id hardly even say its unwanted. Playful notes of honey, mineral and more freshly cut grass linger on the crisp, well-carbonated, dry finish.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4536,"2017-03-09",3.5,"Pour from a nice looking can. Pour is a hazy golden with a medium white head that leaves nice lacing. Nose is of cereals and light grass/herbs. Taste is pretty dry with more cereals, feeling lightly toasted. Body and carbonation were both average. Overall a pretty good micro pils and I have some pretty good memories of their IPL so Ill definitely need to check out Bunker more often!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
4536,"2017-02-21",3.4,"Can from Julios. Pours out a hazy light golden color. Lacy off-white head. Flavor is crisp and bready with a slight bit of spice and fruit. Not really true to the style, but tasty overall and quite drinkable.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","MaBeer1972"

Refreshing and quite drinkable, but didnt quite get to the crispness level of the best examples of this style. Still, theres a lot of flavor development and it is really drinkable. Pretty solid stuff.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

4536,"2013-09-05",3.3,"Draught @ Brewery: This one poured a clear golden color. There was almost no head or lacing associated with it. The aroma was lighter, but still good. Some malts, as well as some earthy hops and a hint of spices. The taste is good. Some hop bite, a medium body, malts, some earthy hops and a hint of spiciness. Easy drinking. Not bad!","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"
4536,"2013-08-09",3.3,"My Bottom Line:
Bread dough envelops herbal hops and their bitterness, while citrusy edges nudge this brew into quaffing territory.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the cloudy beige.
-The yeast tended to take over the delicate malt and hop tandem, casting a shadow on the styles usual crispness.
-Drinkability could be higher.
-This is a nice brew, but it is not really what I want in a Pils.

On tap at Eventide Oyster Co, Portland.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
