1342,"2013-09-11",3.6,"On tap @ 8th location. Pours hazy amber with a thin white-ish head. Smell is vanilla, oak and booze from the whiskey barrels, along with sweet malt, and bitter spices. Taste is bourbon, sweet malt and hoppy bitters. Medium body bitter finish. Barrel aged beers can be great but does not help this Scottish ale.","Arizona, USA","JBoan"
1342,"2013-04-25",3.3,"Clear amber with reddish hues pour with minimal white head. Aroma of bourbon, malts, caramel and oak. Taste of malts, caramel, vanilla, coconut and an oaky bourbon masking all the great flavors of the normal kiltlifter which i would prefer.","Calgary, CANADA","maley1"
1342,"2013-04-23",4.0,"I love bourbon barrel beers but sadly this disappointed me.  Kiltlifter is supposed to be a scottish ale but it is much more like your basic american amber and sadly wasting a bourbon barrel on it just made it taste harsh.","USA","bigbeersrule"

Gift of the Magi - On draft at the Hungry Monk. Pours a slightly hazy apple juice color with a thin head and barely any lacing. Aroma of figs. Rum and raisins hit first on the taste followed by a spicy, hop bitterness. 
Oak-aged Jameson Sonoran Inebriator: on tap at Flannys on St. Patricks Day. Pours a very dark brown color with a bubbly thin head. Aroma of oak with slight boozy whiskey notes. Very smooth mouthfeel with hints of oak and dark chocolate but almost no Jameson flavor. Nice, but not as good as Sonorans other cask versions of this beer. 
Mudshark Morning Wood Saison - on draft at Trophys. Pours light golden slightly hazy with an even white head. Aroma of fruit to start with a slight bourbon finish. Taste of apples and hints of maybe plum before the bourbon notes kick in for a dry finish. Since the beer is only barrel-aged for three months, the bourbon is less noticeable than most BA beers. An odd blend. 
SanTan Saison - On draft at Flannys during a tap takeover. Pours a dark orangish amber with no head. Nice sweet nose of banana esters, clove and cotton candy. Heavy bubble gum on the taste with a slightly cloying Belgian yeast tone. Banana flavor on the back end. Nice, clean palate. A damn nice Saison. 
Four Peaks Raj - On tap at the Cornish Pasty in Mesa. Clean amber pour with very little head. Aroma of muted earthy hops, some caramel, and a bit of peppercorn. 
Santan sex panther 2011 -pours a cloudy black with a filmy head and in. Lacing. Aroma of chocolate and dates. Nice Choco. Forward with sweet finish. Midsummer body 
Amuste - On draft at World of Beer - Tempe. Pours a very dark brown with a hint of purple and a tan one-finger head. Aroma of oak, light vinous tones, roasted malts, biscuit, and coffee. Mellow vinous flavor up front (though the grape tones build toward the end) with caramel, prunes, toffee, and a slight bitter coffee finish. Medium body with faint puckering tart mouthfeel. No surprises here; this brew tastes exactly like I expected based on the description.
Kal-haven rye - On tap during the Bells Eccentric Cafe event at the Hungry Monk. spicy nose, very bready, toasted cereal, caraway, citrus, Pours a cloudy dark mandarin color with a frothy head. Muted citrus, fresh bread, a hint of sourness, slight rye. Light body, extremely drinkable. 
Sierra Nevada Brux - bottle. Complex nose of Brett Brux, spicy, vinous note, banana, clove. Sweet vinous forward, tartness but no sour. Golden grass, floral note. Light body. 
BA Bigfoot - bottle. Pours a clear caramel with a filmy head. Aroma of caramel, booze, toffee, syrupy. Taste of syrupy, caramel, treacle, oak, quite hoppy and woody. Extremely dry finish, acidic. Gritty needs to sit. 
Ovila barrel aged quad - on tap. Very sweet nose of brandy, sherry, a hint of bready malt. pours a dark, clear burgundy with a foamy head. Taste of brandy, raisins, hint of cloves, coriander, and sweet pastry finish. Light, refreshing body for a quad. Good brew. 
SN 30th Anniversary Grand Cru - Bottle. Wow, sweet, malty graham cracker aroma, slight piney resin, old paper. A somewhat murky caramel color with a filmy head. Sweet, caramel syrup flavor with a boozy oak notes. Still hot despite the age. Slick palate that coats the mouth. 
Ten fifty-five: 5:11 Belgian Pale - growler pours extremely light, cloudy yellow. Aroma of big esters, bananas, lemongrass, cloves. Lovely light, refreshing lemon, banana, bitter hops. Very light body, low carb and ABV. Nice!
Against the Grain Bo and Luke - From a growler. Aroma of huge smokey phenols that mask any other note. Pours dark caramel brown with bubbly ring head. Taste of oak, lots of caramel, just a touch of smoky malt, hoppy back, and the tiniest bit of bourbon. Slightly sticky mouthfeel with an astringent finish. Flavor isnt nearly as smoky as the aroma. alcohol is well-hidden. Ok. 
Filmishmish - Bottle. Pours an awesome crystal clear light golden. Light, airy aroma with prickly a Lacto bite and some apricots. Balanced sour bite and citrusy flavor. Light body with very tart, abrupt finish. Solid sour, but better fresh. 
SN Blindfold - On tap at the Hungry Monk. Pours a deep brown with an off-white uneven head. Heavy roasty nose with rye and burnt toast. Dry roasted malt forward and very hoppy back. Solid black IPA. 
Maui aloha baktun - 12-oz. can poured into a Maui Brewing shaker. Appearance is that of strong coffee with a half-finger, very uniform dark beige head. Muddled nose of cinnamon, bakers chocolate, cloves, prunes, and a touch of chili. Flavor is bittersweet at first with chocolate, cinnamon, and agave syrup notes before a faint ester note emerges. The chipotle comes through on the aftertaste with a moderate tongue-prickling heat, but it doesnt lend much spice to the taste. Silky texture, light body, and low carbonation with a spicy finish that carries for quite a while. Its worth trying but doesnt surpass very many of the other similar chocolate-chili stouts Ive tried. 
FW abacus - On tap at the Hungry Monk. A clear dark burgandary color with hardly any head. Huge boozy, bourbon aroma with dark cherries and oak. Beautiful smooth bourbon and heavy malt combine for a divine flavor. The oak is present in the background along sweet dark fruit and a hint of spicy clove and tobacco. Velvet smooth texture, and slight astringent tang but with sweet, short finish. Still one of my favorite barleywines. 
Anderson Valley Bourbon Barrel Stout - on tap at Angels Trumpet in a tall pint glass. Pours extremely dark brown with a frothy one-finger khaki head. Aroma of sour mash bourbon, slight molasses. Smooth toffee, chocolate, and cinnamon tones with an even balance between the bourbon sweetness and the sour mash. It doesnt seem as if the stout spent a long time in the wood, as its fairly mellow for a barrel-aged brew. Smooth texture with a spiced abrupt finish. 
Bourbon-Barrel Kiltlifter - On draft in a snifter at Four Peaks Tasting Room (Wilson). Slight bourbon nose (but not nearly pronounced as most barrel-aged beers) with heavy caramel, some oak, and vanilla. Pours a deep, clear amber with a perfect, craggy, one-finger head. The bourbon hits first on the taste followed by slightly cloying caramel, a woody resin tone, and a faint tropical fruitiness. The sweetness increases as the beer warms, but the bourbon dissipates. A definite improvement on the base beer and it held up better in the barrel than most other barrel-aged Scottish ales Ive tried.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
1342,"2012-05-09",4.1,"On draught at the Scottsdale location.  Pours a clear amber/light caramel color with a thin off-white head.  Aroma has vanilla, coconut, fruit, bourbon.  Taste is sweet with loads of vanilla, coconut, some pit fruits (apricot)?  Medium bodied and oily.  Smooth finish.  I was really pretty impressed with this beer and somewhat surprised that the Kilt Lifter held up to the barreling as well as it did.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","dcschiller"
1342,"2010-01-25",3.7,"Cloudy dark caramel color. Small off white head. Cheesy, bourbon aroma.  Reminds me of a friendship bread starter. Flavor is a bit if cheese, lots of barrel. Wayyyy better than the regular.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
1342,"2009-08-17",3.5,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2010 pours a shade darker than the normal KL... slightly hazed with a creamy dense tan head and drippy lace.

the smell reminds me of the sun tea the wife makes... floral, cream, caramel malt, vanilla and just a touch of bourbon spice. 

weak flavor... also, it seems to be drier having spent time in that barrel. flavors of cocoa butter, earthy spice akin to black peppercorns, vanilla, cereal grain and really smooth watered down bourbon. it tastes like they topped off half a barrel of beer with water... not flawed, just muted. odd decision to put a mediocre beer in bourbon in the first place??

medium bodied with a slick mouth feel. these do go down awfully easy though... 

why is the largest brewery in the state the only one pushing the envelope?... huge props for trying and keep the fun stuff coming.... 6/3/6/3/15/3.3

on tap 1/25/2010... the extra time in the  barrel has done wonders for this. really cheesey aroma... the bourbon is really starting to shine... big sour mash notes, char, vanilla, brown sugar, cream cheese and fruit in both the aroma and flavor. 7/3/7/3/16/3.6","scottsdale über alles, Arizona, USA","hellbilly"
1342,"2009-08-11",3.7,"Snifter at the Tempe location.  Pours a black tea color with a creamy beige head.  Smells of fruit punch, vanilla,  and toasted coconut.  Starts out much the same, but deadens in a Cheerio cereal flavor on the mid palate.  Better than the original, but the base beer just cant stand up.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","nbutler11"
1342,"2009-07-22",3.9,"On tap at Four Peaks in Tempe. Pours a very deep ruby brown/red with next to no head. Aroma is bready bourbon, rich malts, and a definite sour twinge. Flavor is thinner than expected, has lots of deep malt flavors with definite oak tannin and bourbon nuances, balanced by that sour twinge. This beer is way better than the original and perfectly balanced. One of the tastier beers Ive had in the past year. Very interesting and worth seeking out if you get the chance.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Avengedpoet"
1342,"2009-07-22",3.8,"On tap at Four Peaks Tempe.

Pours a barely opaque reddish brown with a very small soapy off white head that quickly subdues into a ring of film. Aroma is sour mash, bourbon, wood, caramel with a sour twinge that stands out. Flavor is oak, bourbon (light watered down bourbon), caramel, dark fruits, tannins, peat, some earthy notes. Body is thin and the beer is not as sweet as a normal Kilt Lifter. All of the flavors are in balance and meld together nicely. Much different than expected, but still very good.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Rusty"
