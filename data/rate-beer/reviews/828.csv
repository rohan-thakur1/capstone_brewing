828,"2017-02-14",4.2,"Quand on lit la remarque commerciale sur ratebeer, il y a de quoi attraper un fou-rire...
En effet, on y parle de longues discussions sur le style de cette bière, alors que précisément celui-ci ne pose strictement aucun problème !! A linverse, la majorité du temps, le classement serait discutable, et on classe sans aucune concertation.. Ici donc on discute beaucoup avant de classer alors que le classement est évident, il y a de quoi se rouler par terre !!!
En effet, une bière en fermentation basse est une lager, et comme son niveau abv est élevé (8,7 %),
il sagit donc bien sûr dune ""strong pale lager"", encore appelée imperial pils ..
Aucun problème, et classement évident.
Signalons quand même leffort du brasseur pour faire du dry hopping sur cette bière et pour la refermenter en bouteille, ce qui est rare pour une lager, mais ce qui nentraîne aucun changement pour son classement 
Dry hopping donc en tettnanger et bramling cross.
Mon exemplaire était à 8 mois avant sa date.
Couleur doré pâle, avec un léger voile presque comme une blanche.
Bulles fines, partout, très vives.
Mousse blanche épaisse, avec structure plus ferme en haut, stable à 10 mm.
Arômes de malt pils, grillé, citron, pointe de mangue, houblon vif.
1ère bouche très souple à lentame malt/citron/feuilles dacanthe.
Arrière-bouche sur malt pils et coriandre.
2ème au joli ensemble bien malté avec citron et épices.
Arrière-bouche longue, prégnante, jolie.
3ème au très beau maltage.
Arrière-bouche équilibrée.
Longueur qui prolonge les mêmes impressions, sans pourtant les sublimer.
Jambes fines, longues, un peu collantes en haut.
Levure fine, un peu épicée, très belle ligne.
Alcool très correct, il soutient manifestement la longueur.
Finale à la belle amertume, mais un peu pâteuse ..
CONCLUSION : belle impériale pils, à qui il ne manque quun peu plus dharmonie et une longueur plus enthousiaste .. Pas le Nobel, mais un prix de consolation ...","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

828,"2016-02-11",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 17, 2016

Aroma:

Slight/medium aroma of malts, Belgian yeast, honey, caramel, fruit, straw and hops.

Appearance:

Turbid/opaque yellow/golden beer with medium yeast and with a slight/medium white/off-white head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium sweet with malts, Belgian yeast, honey, caramel and fruit; ends slightly bitter and dry with straw and hops.

Overall:

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. I can imagine the debate about the style of this beer, feels like a Belgian Ale/Imperial Pilsener mix. It manages to do this without a problem. The aroma could have been stronger, the appearance is great and unfiltered, the flavour is decent all-over and the palate is great.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

The first thing I notice is the alcohol - it arrives early, and provides warmth far beyond the finish.  The taste begins with sweet malt that is given a hard push by floral bitters.  Both sides are so persistent that neither can gain a strong enough foothold to dismiss the other.  Most of the flavor shows up in the back of the mouth with a fullness that suggests sipping may be the only way to enjoy this.  I like it, but one is enough.","Lakeside Park, Kentucky, USA","rondphoto"

All round dryed hop aroma, very fresh with a little mint in the nose and grass/straw lurking in the background. If you sniff hard with your nose to the beer you really get an alcohol whiff!

Taste wise - zesty citrus hoppy taste with relatively strong alcohol flavour in the aftertaste also slightly peppery in the aftertaste!

Quite a lot of carbonation going on with a medium body to this beer in terms of mouthfeel. Head subsided to a small ocean of a covering whilst drinking and a little lacing around the edge of the glass.

Overall an OK beer, but not one Id revisit given the choice over others.

Popping the top yields a bit of a hiss, after I finally got the rubber up, as it was quite stuck on the lip of the bottle. Pour initially yields a few bubbles and no real head. Bit of a galaxy swirl on top of the brew as well as a thin collar. Dark peach body is translucent.

Nose brings forward a lot of pilsener malt plus a bit of herbal and floral hops. Theres a slight fruitiness in the nose that becomes more apparent in the flavor. Fairly hoppy with a bit of bitterness, though the main character is a strong pilsner-malt sweetness. To the beers credit, theres no noticeable alcohol. However, the sweetness and fruits dont really fit. Quite bready and a bit chewy.

Body is medium without noticeable levels of alcohol. Light carbonation. Full and chewy; not at all crisp. Some light bitterness in the finish, though the hoppy character is mostly in the nose, as a result of the dry hopping, Im sure.

Taste is bready cereals, spiciness certainly coming from the hops, dough, salt, white sugar, pears, canned pineapples, some dry grass, a bit of booze.  This beer had disappeared from the LCBO for a good six months, and then it reappeared in large quantities, so I assumed it was a fresh batch.  But the bottle I drank lacked crispness and there was some slightly overripe fruits flavors.  Poor transport condition or a not-so-fresh batch put on the shelves?  A far cry from their excellent Christoffel Blond which is one of the best bottled pilsner on the planet.  Basically I was expecting a lot more so this beer was a disappointment to me.

Head is initially small, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing.

Aroma is lightly malty (grain), lightly to moderately hoppy (apricot), lightly yeasty (sweaty socks, dough), with notes of cardboard and dirt (no, really...dirt, just dried common light brown mud, the stuff you annoyingly scrape off your shoes, not the rich dark brown peaty earth that you might dig your bare toes into gleefully).

Kind of hilarious, actually.  These just arrived in the area (no bottle date, though), but theyre quite oxidized already.  Lets follow the trail of laughs.  First, the bottle itself...see the picture on this page?  The neck label is the same, but the imports Ive seen dont have the body label.  Instead, theyre just narrow white labels (one on the front and one on back) that are about the same size as ordinary stick-on envelope address labels, complete with plain black low-resolution jagged fonts that look like they were made with a Commodore 64 (with which I used to make labels just like these when I was a teenager! ah, memories!).  Fabulously awful.  Ok, so now lets pour the beer.  Whoa, check it out!  Theres almost as much sludge in here as that godawful first batch (or was it the second, I cant remember now) of bottled Dark Lord.  So much muck, so little time...lets take a whiff.  Oooooh, baby!  Oxidation and dirt are jumping out of the glass, stand back and make room!  Whee, theres even some stinky feet in there too.  And yep, that stale papery aftertaste is there, so obviously not ALL of the oxidation has leaped from the glass!  Now, granted, there are some apricotty hops in the nose too, which as it breathes eventually become dominant.  This was more of an amusing experience than a truly wretched one, so Im glad to have had it.  90% of it went down the drain, but the memory will live for a long time to come.  Hard to imagine this is what the brewer intended, but until next time, I will assume the worst...","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

The taste starts with a moderately sharp herbal bitterness followed by mostly clean grain and just a hint of butterscotch. There is a light handed but constant tropical and domestic fruity component here before a shockingly sharp peppery and caraway seed spicy finish. The mouth feel is a tad too aggressive but unlike many of these ""Imperialized"" or over hopped lagers, this actually attempts to hide the alcohol and does not provide those off aromas and flavors often found in these over the top attempts. I can understand why this is among the higher rated of this new bastardized genre, leave it to a good European ""craft"" brewery to show how you can do these ""imperialized"" lagers and still make it approachable and somewhat enjoyable.

Blooming herbal hops and bready, doughy yeast combine, while lightly citrusy currents and ample pilsener malts create complexity.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam skirts the cloudy golden.
-The amped-up, fresh noble hop nose was reminiscent of some Franconian Kellerbiers.
-The pils malts produce slightly sulphuric notes.
-The relaxed effervescence makes for a comfy mouthfeel.
-With a flavor profile like this, Id prefer something like 5% abv. But this is still very good for what it is and Id have it anytime I get a chance to see it.

Alcohol more than sneaks up as the finish deploys, confusing slightly the green, highly herbal, almost onion-like hops. All throughout, not so soft malts keep insisting upon their bread concentrate notions. Many good elements here, the cleanliness is all here, the texture and looks are beyond reproach and the higher gravity does not come with any agressivity. While the more drinkable (less residual sugars and heat) blonde is far more enjoyable, this remains an excellent drink, it just isnt very clear what purpose a strong blonde lager serves as the flavour concentration inevitably removes from the ingredients purity and freshness impression.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Overall : Nice malty and hoppy profile that I like in the Blond but I dont think this alcohol boost makes it better. Nice beer nonetheless but I keep thinking id rather have the regular blond.

Taste: Starts sweet, honeyish even with a zip of pils malt graininess. The dose of Nobel hops provides some floral, spicy qualities as well as a slight grassiness. Oh, and dont forget the bitterness. Again, theres that teensy grape note from the aroma carrying over. A touch of alcohol accompanies the bitterness on the finish.

828,"2010-01-02",3.2,"11.2oz swing top bottle from 99 Bottles.  Pours a basically still and really murky silver golden.  Seeing this one on the shelf, I was a bit excited as I really enjoy an imperial pils...not sure of the age on this one thought.  The seal on the swing cage, is the same as in the picture but the label on the bottle I have is a fairly plain small rectangular white one with black text.  Nose is fairly sweet, with mostly wildflower honey.  Some light sweet bread, a decent pine aroma and some other floral notes.  Honey sweetness up front with a hint of buttery bread, a touch of floral piney-ness, with an alcohol presence on the end.  Kind of thin on the body.  I like the honey characteristics, but really not much else going on here and pretty messy plus the hops are just too far gone imho.

828,"2009-11-27",3.5,"A very nice orange color with a small head.  Cannot see through the beer, too dark and hazy yet glowing. Aroma is sweet malt and sweet yet green and noble like hops.  Its weird, lots of sweetness but not in the caramel manner. Just sugar and strong green/noble hops.  Flavor is less sugary on the malts and more noble hops coming through.  A strong bitterness finishes it off.  Especially for a lager, this is still very unbalanced, which isnt always bad but here it is not good.

On the other hand you have the traditionalists who stick to a particular style and method that they have done for ages. Christoffel Nobel is a beer which retains traditional style elements but still goes its own way. That alone is worth some appreciation. It has a nice and distinct aroma, good dry hop taste which blends well into the brew and it packs a serious punch too without being dominated by alcohol taste.

828,"2009-09-05",3.0,"Too big for its own good. I can see the attempt. The brewery wanted to make a big good lager with a ton of nobel hops. While I salute the endeavor, something didnt go right. I admit the possibility that something could be wrong with this particular bottle, but I have no reason to think its been poorly handled or anything. At any rate, it tastes like a cheap strong Euro lager or even an American malt liquor (and I dearly apologize to the Christoffel brewers who are probably very nice gentlemen who know a ton about beer and brewing). Theres just a mildly stomach-turning flavor to that sweet malt married to a lager yeast that kills it for me. The boatload of metallic nobel hops dont bring enough spice for me, although there is a relatively nice grassy quality in there. Theres a funny, thick aftertaste that I dont particularly care for, as well. The feel isnt bad, but its hard for me to get past the flavor. As a sidenote, this beer tastes little to nothing like any Czech Pilsener that Ive ever tasted. Anyway, its another beer that Id love to give a second chance particularly if I ever find myself at the brewery.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

I tried this beer on April 30, 2009 at ""Smokeless Joes"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The beer poured a hazy golden orange, with a thick fluffy white head.  The aroma was grainy malt, and a piney hoppish note.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied with medium carbonation.  The flavour was grainy malt, some citrusy lemon notes, and a hoppy bitter finish","Milton, Ontario, CANADA","cyrenaica"

828,"2009-04-04",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 14, 2009 Bottled 33cl. Courtesy of bierkoning. Appearance: It pours a beautiful hazy golden beer with a nice average sized dense white head. Good lacework. Aroma: The nose is wonderfully hoppy, fruity with mandarin, elderflower, pineapple, mint, Devonshire cream, rose and horse blanket appearing. Flavor and palate: Sublime hop profile. Great balance. Good bitterness. Peppery. A lot of elderflower, mandarin, rose and pineapple showing up again in the taste. Medium to full bodied. Smooth. The alcohol is very nicely hidden. Dry finish with lingering hops and licorice which makes you eager to take another sip. Overall impression: My kind of Imperial IPA or ESL or whatever. Excellent. Clearly underrated in my opinion. Thanks a lot bierkoning!","SWITZERLAND","Embrouille"

828,"2009-02-04",3.6,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2009 Bottled from Bierkoning, Amsterdam. Hazy yellow/orange coloured, white head. Overwhelming hoppy nose, Saaz all the way, great. Very bitter flavour right from the beginning, which even increases towards the finish. Interesting style, something like a ""European"" Double IPA. I personally like those hoppy beers more easy to drink, so ill stick with the Christoffel Blond, but its certainly a nice try.","Bussum, NETHERLANDS","jerohen"

828,"2009-01-20",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2009 Update: Crazy beer, Has acetone-ish elements because of the high hopping of this type; have seem similar profile in some bottles of Gaspar. Original: THIS IS NOT AN IPA. This is clearly a lager, as indicated by the label stating ""bottom fermented."" Thus, at this ABV, I suggest a European Strong Lager, as some other rater has also suggested.

Insanely dry, grassy, bitter - a seriously tingling bitterness pervades this whole thing. The beer is thinner than most Euro Strong Lagers or even American Imperial Pilsners; none of that cloying sweetness. This is Saaz/Tettnang to the extreme; flowery and intense. Some barnyardyness. The flavor is almost too intense and shows a hint of acetone. Beautiful head, beautiful golden, orangey color.

The second I read about this beer I knew I would want it. Christoffel makes very natural beers, and this is all hops. Delightful. Thanks to bierkoning!","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

828,"2008-12-30",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2010 Bottle from De Bierkoning. Very cloudy, almost milky yellow colour, creamy white head. Aroma of sweet citrusfruits, mostly lemons, hops, a hint of alcohol.

Its actually an unfiltered strong lager, but with all the qualities of a good strong IPA. Very well done! 849418
Re-rate: Ive had this a couple of times now, and am not as enthousiastic as I was before, especially not when its from tap. The combination of the alcohol with the hops is quite harsh at times, and its rather sweet imo. Still a really good beer, but not a 4.3. 748416","Zaandam, NETHERLANDS","Borresteijn"
