Im not sure you are ready to handle this level of cred, but take a peek if you dare:

Yup, thats a magnum of Ann. 
It was an experience that transcended beer and life itself. Poured at the Hill Farmstead 7th anniversary week on Saturday. Spilt with some very generous and very hungover bros who Ive never met before and will probably never see again. It was a perfect medley of honey, wine and funk that was more than the sum of its parts. Shared against the backdrop of the Vermont countryside, it was ethereal in every sense. It was too perfect for you to understand without being there yourself...without the setting, it doesnt get a 5. Without the magnum it doesnt get a 5. Without the people I shared it with, it doesnt get a 5. But...put all those together and you have perfection. In every sense. Without apology and without reservation, this beer is the greatest thing ever brewed, bar none.","Victor, New York, USA","MacBoost"

Flavor is delicate with nice light acidity. Light stone fruit, melon and pineapple notes. A light herbal note with light oak notes. Batch 1 has a lot more honey notes with some light spiciness. Delicate, soft water notes with light bitterness.

2855,"2015-09-15",4.7,"Bottle picked up at Hill Farmstead last February and shared at my wedding on 9/12/15. Pour was a slightly hazy blonde, lively eggshell head that breaks into gorgeous lace and remains throughout. Aromas are very inviting! Notes of oak, vanilla, light honey sweetness, light barnyard funk, medium floral and light earth. Taste is phenomenal! Such a balance of flavors throughout. Less honey and less Brett than the base beer, Anna.....but was a wonderful transformation through the barrel inflection. Nice rounded tartness gives off light hints of underripe apples and grapes...vinous and earthy in the mid-palate. Very much to my liking!! Light funk pushes through the back-end where the honey emerges in harmony with oak/vanilla to counter nicely. Finishes semi-dry, semi-sweet and lightly tart. Wonderful, wonderful beer....for a wonderful, wonderful night!","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"
2855,"2015-08-06",4.6,"UPDATED: JUN 19, 2017 May 2014 Magnum shared by Adam C on 7/25/15.Hazy burnished copper with a good amount of fairly well-retained white head atop.Brightness of Anna lightly dulled, but in the best way possible, replacing it with soft lactic acids. Again more of the floral-sulfur-grass thing going on (thats my closest approximation to describing the aroma of these wonderful saisons, and its admittedly terrible and sounds unappealing, but Ill work on it once I get a whole bottle to myself....). Bits of honey on the end are just begging you to drink it.Very well-restrained on the barrel character, compared to Art. Bright acidity, wildflower notes producing the same light stickiness. As it progresses, you get a pineapple-near-the-rind sort of flavor that is nicely dry but still has some good tartness and a pinch of sweetness. Bits of vanilla and light wood with some juicier melon notes. Hard to describe, these beers of Shawns. The flavors are all so new to me and its overwhelming to try them all for the first time this weekend. I can say that the mouthfeel, balance and attenuation are perfect here once again.2014 375mL drunk 5/26/17 at the brewery.Was really hoping to try the 2016 batch but they ONLY had the 2014.  DAMN.  Life is hard.Still smells wonderful; tons of tart acidity, spicy phenols and floral character from the honey with very soft oak and rich honeyed malt tones through it all.  Very clean and much more gentle than when fresh.Soft and very easygoing in the mouth with a lingering honey-like sweetness, soft wood tannins and lots of grass, juicy pineapple and melon.  The carbonation is very low at this point and maybe the 375mLs havent aged as gracefully as the larger format bottles, as this is just a touch tired (I wouldnt continue aging these small bottles more than a year and would definitely drink them now), though certainly still highly enjoyable.  Bright acidity on the very end still helps enliven things but the tight, almost champagne-like carbonation that make Shauns sours so delightful is no longer very present here.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2855,"2013-05-18",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 30, 2015 Woodshed 2.0. Yellow waxed 750mL bottle share courtesy of dak. It pours with an opaque pale gold body with copper hues and a near white head of foam. The aroma offers up sweaty socks, smooth soft vinegar, muted sugar coated spicy oak, apples and apricots. Smells very inviting. The taste is smooth yet mildly tart heading into smooth soft sour vinegar, apricot, pineapple and faint moldy spicy oak. The vinegar shows up now and then but is smooth, modest in strength and has a softness to it that really gives the experience extra depth and interest. Tasty rich stuff.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
2855,"2013-04-25",4.3,"In short: An uber-rustic, oaky and honeyed blond Saison.  Elegant, complex, excellent.
How: Bottle 750ml, thick yellow bee wax.  Consumed 5 months after the beer release.  First batch (only batch so far).  Bottle #258.
The look: Cloudy blond body topped by a medium off-white head with good retention.
In long: Nose is very rustic, quite oaky and also a bit honeyed.  Overall very bright and clean nose that is a bit like Anna but with extra rusticity and oaky notes.  Taste starts with very nice crisp cereals, slightly honeyed and with a fresh hay sensation.  Theres a nice oak presence that is not overdone.  Also lemon zest, oaky white wine, a strong rustic yeast presence that doesnt go into wild/brett territory, a fun cobweb sensation.  Dry oaky finish with the rusiticy shining.  A beer that is both nourishing and refreshing.  Superb mouthfeel with a full body and a lively carbonation.  The world that kept coming back to my mind was elegant.  Extremely pleasant to drink, this is almost a thirst beer which is very unusual for such a highly rated beer, high scores on ratebeer are usually reserved for high-intensity beers.  Hill Farmstead are brewing the best Saisons on the planet, no doubt about this anymore, and with a Saison lineup that includes Arthur, Art, Flora, Vera Mae, Civil Disobediences and more, I only rank Ann as a slightly above average Hill Farmstead Saison.  Id like to get a few more bottles, but unfortunately finding a bottle of Ann just by asking around is as unlikely as catching a fish just by standing next to a lake going fishy, fishy fishy..."".","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2855,"2013-02-05",4.0,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip.  From notes.

Ann has a great cloudy golden straw appearance with a fluffy white cap.

The aroma is full of honey, white grapes, straw, and pale malts, with the microflora, pear, and lemon zest taking a bit of a backseat.

My first sip starts out nicely sweet with honey and light malts.  White grapes and pear add a little bit of fruit character to the sweetness.  Straw, grass, and a mineral presence come in later on, followed by a spicy oak note, with the finish ultimately being dry and clean.

Ann has a slightly heavier body than Anna does with a little bit less carbonation, but overall it still has a medium body with a moderate level of crisp carbonation.  There is a bit of a zesty tartness that will probably continue to develop over time.  It is fairly dry.

Even someone who does not go crazy for saisons has to appreciate the quality of a beer like this.  The original beer is delicate and complex, and the aging process has only added to the character.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

2855,"2012-12-08",4.2,"Bottle #260. Thanks Shaun. Enjoyed at 55 Degrees F in a snifter on my GFs birthday. 

A - The beeswax surrounding this bottle smells amazing. The best smelling bottle Ive ever had.  Gorgeous clarity. Bright golden orange with a  3 finger fluffy solid white head. Head fades to a finger and remains. Pillow-like lacing sticks decently.  A very nice steady stream of bubbles travel bottom to top for as long as Im drinking it. Looks a lot like a Prosecco.

S - Grape skins and lemongrass on the nose. Lots of characters that remind me of Prosecco and Sauvignon Blanc. Lovely citrus and wine tannins and a splash of honey sweetness.

T - Very sweet like lemon, tangerines and grapefruit. Dash of wine tannins at the finish with a super dry finish. I dont pick up a lot of honey but there is this tart wild yeast aspect that compliments the excellent wheat and grassiness.

M - Medium body and a very nice balanced medium carbonation. A hint of an astringent listerine mouth wash finish but its not drastic and you really have to swish quite a bit to get it.

O - Hype, Hype, Hype. So Ann, the elusive Ann. Her? Im enjoying drinking this right now. Its tasty and enjoyable but I prefer Art which, for most purposes, is the best beer to compare with Ann. Juicy, Mimosa and Flora, in my opinion, exceed Ann in taste, body and the nose. Art is still the definite winner of Hill Farmstead Barrel Aged farmhouse ales. Would I pick up Ann again? OF COURSE! Its delicious and delicate and graceful throughout. However, the best saison Ive ever had? Sorry but its not. Try this if you can. Its a fantastic beer!

I got a later pour of this beer but saw others. The beer is yellow, straw clear but with a poorly settled yeast that fills the bottom pours with a cloudy white haze. The higher pours are clear and crisp yellow. Wispy white head of small bubbles, some retention, mild carbonation. Looks good. Also the bottle looks really nice. The beeswax really adds to the overall beer. 

Aroma is the best part. Super complex. At times I can smell a vinous white wine quality, saison yeast, honey, flowers, other times pineapple and Brett c breaks through. Very wonderful smelling beer. 

This beer has it all. Seriously. The honey character falls out slightly for me and it is close to perfect. The body is light and airy. Sweet with a yeasty funk mild oakiness with some grape and softer sweet fruits. The finish is thin but not overly dry. I really loved it and would of course have this beer again.

Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass.

The beer is a beautiful golden color with a soft, white head. Noticeable lacing throughout the glass.

The aroma brings honey, grass, lemons, subtle funk, white wine, oak. Really complex and profound. The beeswax cap smells fantastic as well.

The flavor is a tad sweet, with a beautiful honey presence. Extremely well balanced. With every sip, a new flavor seems to emerge. Lovely white wine / white grape character. Pleasant, subtle tart character in the finish. Without doubt the most complex and gracefully balanced example of the style I have yet encountered. Like sipping a world class champagne or white wine.

The beer itself pours a nice, bright yellow.  Fairly clear with a huge white head and great retention.  As the head falls, heavy sheets of lacing on the sides of the glass.  Collar throughout.  

The nose carries a wonderful mixture of white wine, honey, hay, lemon zest, very light barnyard, and a touch of acidity.  Masterfully blended so that each time I take another whiff, something else seems to come to the front.  The flavor is equally as integrated, and is aided by an absolutely incredible mouthfeel.  Some green grapes alongside lemon and hay.  Mild earthy funk behind a good dose of white wine.  Touch of oak.

Mouthfeel is crisp.  Very nice carbonation.  The mouthfeel is an enigma.  At the same time, theres a touch of sweetness alongside a bit of white-wine tartness, mild funk, and touch of oak.  Each aspect is beautifully melded together.  Hard to describe.  The flavor lingers and is accentuated by mild acidity.  Saison and touch of pepper comes through at the very end.

Golden yellow-orange with just over a finger of creamy, white head. 

Ann smells pungently of citrus, tropical fruit, and floral honey. The wine barrel aging works perfectly, imparting juicy lemon; a delicate grassiness; and ripe green grape; and hinting at a tickling acidity.

Ann is not tame, but civila pinch earthier and more obviously saison-like than the nose, with lemon verbena; citrusy, almost limey tartness; and a sweet-grassiness. Ann remarkably balances a number of disparate elementsmost obviously, the citrusy sweet elements (lemon/tropical fruit) with the citrusy tart elements.

It smells so good that i was hesitant to drink.  Flavor follows the aroma.  Funk, acidity, lemon, citrus, oak, wine, a hint of malt sweetness.  Tastes as good as it smells.  Medium body, very creamy.  The mouthfeel is as impressive as the aroma and flavor.  I do not rate many beers, but this is perfect for a funky/sour saison.  I have been impressed with everything from Hillfarmstead that Ive tried, but this beer is on a differnt level.  The only flaw is that not many people will get to drink this.","Pennsylvania, USA","McGrupp612"
2855,"2012-07-20",5.0,"Bottle, thanks Shaun.   Poured into the brewers stemware.  Natural hazy golden pour with a medium sized fine bubbled white head with lots of lace.   Super clean and tart nose, wine barrel comes through but harmonizes so naturally with the base beer that youd think it was always meant to be there.  Light honey, lemon, oak.   Fantasticly integrated flavor as well and not as wine dominant as some of HFB other wine barrel aged beers. Slightly slick and acidic palate, could stand for a touch more crispness but Im not sure if thats really a legitimate critique.   But this is a damn fine beer.  Shit, Im really having trouble finding a way to take points away from this beer and its everything I want in a saison plus more.  This sorta reminds me of Shauns Saison Lambic Pinot Noir that he brewed in Denmark for the Norreboro brewery with the os that have lines going through them possibly diagonally but this is better.  I can honestly say that Id rather be home here in NC drinking this awesome beer than to be in LA right now drinking copious amounts of awesome shit with my homies.  Because this is that good and I have it all to myself.  Sometimes, you have to be selfish.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
2855,"2012-07-20",4.8,"Poured into some Hill Farmstead stemware. Beautiful golden honey body with a fingers worth of foamy white head. Nice lacing. Lots of earthy French oak notes in the aroma. Light mustiness with hay and floral honey. The taste continues to bring out some great oak notes from the barrel and mixes with a touch of honey and earthy grains. Light floral-citrus acidity throughout. Tastes amazing. Body is smooth with perfect carbonation. The mouthfeel has a nice creaminess to it. Overall, this beer is essentially perfect. I really cant see how a farmhouse ale/saison could get better than this. One of the best beers I have ever had.","New Hampshire, USA","sisuspeed"
2855,"2012-07-20",4.8,"Clear deep golden body under an airy tall white head. Floral lemon and sun-kissed hay on the nose. Deliciously harmonious flavors... pineapple, floral honey, white grape, slight barrel presence and hints of funk. Crisp but not overly-dry. Ridiculously easy-drinking. If I could drink one beer for the rest of my life, I might very well chose this.","Hanover, New Hampshire, USA","strawberry"

2855,"2012-07-15",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2012 Bottle (750 ml) # 28. Hazy straw color with a small persistent white head and superb lacing. Amazing aroma of brett, lactic acid, tons of fruits, strong floral notes and some spices. Taste is great with white grapes, winey notes, lactic acid, citrus and loads of fruits. Lingering fruity/winey finish. Mouthfeel is smooth and slight acidic. This beer is a masterpiece of balance! Wonderful complexity and still refreshing and drinkable. One of the best beers I had so far! Wow!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2855,"2012-07-15",4.7,"Absolute masterpiece shared with ernesto987.  First thing I noticed was the bees wax dipping and the great aroma that gave off, i know its a little detail but its part of what makes Hill Farmstead Special.  Pours a cloudy pale straw color with billowy mirangue head that retains and leaves behind great lacing.  The aroma is just out of this world.  Aroma is tart lactic acid, floral perfumes, citrus fruits, musty basement(in a good way), and a mixture of spices.  Initial mouthfeel is amazing and smooth/creamy and the flavors start hitting right away.  Medium sweetness and floral notes with light fruits give away to tart lactic acid and citrus elements.  The finish is dry and welcoming and leads you to want to take another sip.  This is the type of craft and attention to detail that you rarely find.  STUNNING.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
2855,"2012-07-14",4.7,"See Shaun!! I didnt sell my bottle on eBay, Im drinking it right now. I have a picture of me drinking it. All jokes aside this might be the best beer Ive ever had. You continue to outdo yourself which I am simply amazed by. Huge floral wine notes on a sour background. Good amount of citrus flavors. Lingering sour finish. How is the possible? This made the drive up worth it. Amazing!!!!","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
2855,"2012-05-28",4.3,"pours a clear golden color with a frothy head that builds quickly. smells of wine barrel at first then the saison esters, brett and bright lactic notes. taste is a light saison with balanced barrel notes and a light acidity. more acidity than an average JP, yet balanced for the flavors. overall bone dry.","New Jersey, USA","fbm115"
2855,"2012-05-27",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2012 750 mL bottle shared on Friday night of the 2nd Anniversary party by Shaun. Generally, this is Anna aged in Sauvignon Blanc barrels. 

Frothy, retentive near white head settles on a hazed golden body, slowly fading to a finger thick head and thin sheets of lace. Nose if funky, fruity and mildly sour. Medium light body, effervescent carbonation, and soft full texture. The barrel aging adds a dimension missing from the base beer, adding a strong white grape and light lactic sour presences; overall sweet and fruity though out, but well balanced and a dry finish. Same as James, this was a favorite of the weekend for me; cant wait for a release of this.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","yourefragile"
2855,"2012-05-26",4.9,"UPDATED: AUG 8, 2012 Bottle courtesy of Shaun at the Hill Farmstead 2nd Anniversary vip party. A bright golden pour yields a great frothy white head with thick lacing. White grape juice, quenching lactic acid, and mead notes abound, with an ever present funk profile, giving way to earthen cheesy brett and tropical fruits. Light body with pillowy effervescence and a dry crisp finish. I absolutely loved this beer, and it was one of the highlights of the event for me. 


Re-rate from a release bottle. Shared with my dad on my birthday. Nice to revisit this beer when I am completely sober. I certainly wasnt for my original rating, but surprisingly I captured it pretty well. Very vinous, funky, and lactic, with vibrant nectar and tropical fruits trailing off with mead like notes. Complex farmy brett. The palate is just perfect. Soft but full carbonation with a bone dry finish. Vibrant, bright and complex. This is without a doubt my favorite beer from Hill Farmstead.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
