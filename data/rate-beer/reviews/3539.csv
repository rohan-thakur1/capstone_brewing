3539,"2015-05-30",3.8,"Bottle (750 ml). From kcherney, thanks! Split with the Québec crew.

Appearance: Cloudy yellow-golden with a small white ring of foam, low retention and not much lacing. 

Aroma: The first whiff is incredibly citric but it quickly settles down to become much more enjoyable with bright tangerine notes, peaches, herbal notes and mild spiciness. 

Taste: More balanced than the aroma even though the bright citrus/tangerine is shining again. Quite citric with floral notes, herbal presence and mild salty notes. 

Palate: Light to medium body. Medium carbonation. Citric finish with a mild salty aftertaste. 

Overall: Very citric. Its a bit intense at first, but it then become quite drinkable. On par with the regular and the Nelson version. Not sure it really fits in the style, but its tasty stuff nonetheless.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
