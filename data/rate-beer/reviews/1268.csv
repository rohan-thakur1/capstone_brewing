The aroma and flavor are citrus and caramel. Purists might be appalled at this being hopped so prominently but what else would you expect from Deschutes? On the last pour some sediment made the beer cloudier and more buttery, too. With much warmer temperatures I begin to taste melon zest and pineapple. A hint of brown sugar and coconut, too.

This is not by any means a classic pub ale - its far hoppier than nearly any other ESB I can recall having, excepting only Driftwoods Naughty Hildegard. An excellent brew all around, and one that I feel no hesitation in recommending. (16/20)","CANADA","UXO"

It has a hoppy malty thing going on in the smell. Bready and caramel malt with a bunch of grass.

Malt, both bread and caramel lead in the taste. Grassy hops in the finish are there to compliment/assist rather than take over the taste profile. It does so pretty brilliantly. Every flavour unites rather than divides.

Light orange pour, rich lacing. If you tried to imagine an Oregon interpretation of a classic pub ESB, this is pretty much what youd imagine. 20-30% higher ABV, much more aggressive c-hopping. But its cold, its beer, its not the same old, so its drinkable enough. Earthy, but man that crystal hop finish is harsh for the style.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Translucent light amber coloured ale with a large thick and densely frothy creme coloured head.

Taste the same but with a very bitter middle stage..then it calms down to its English roots.
Great mouth feel they got the carbonation just right.
A very good beer but is this a premium bitter/ESB?
I am not sure the hop bitterness is out of place and i would say this is a very good hoppy amber.

1268,"2016-04-21",3.6,"Poured from bomber into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a deeper amber color with a creamy head of two finger height. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a decent level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the brew is strongest of a sweeter caramel and doughy aroma along with some other smells of a light fruit nature of peach and orange. Along with these aromas comes some lighter notes of hop of an earthy and pine nature.
 Taste  The taste begins with a slightly bready and lightly sweetened taste, with the sweet being a mix of caramel and some orange. As the taste advances some hop tastes come to the tongue with them being predominantly of pine and earth, but containing a little bit of citrus as well. Some of the caramel fades a little bit, but is replaced by more orange and a little bit of a sour lemonade like flavor more toward the end. At the very end a little bit of grass joins the flavor profile and ends up leaving a rather bready, moderately fruity, but slightly dank flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is average in thickness with a carbonation level that is a bit high. The average body was spot on for the mix of slightly dank hop and bready sweet, although a little less carbonation may have given it a slightly better and more cask like feel (which I think this would be a great pour style for).
 Overall  A fairly nice Pub ale overall. A little high in ABV., but quite tasty and enjoyable overall. One to certainly try if you get the chance.","","Darkmagus82"
