Tart for only a moment before youre launched into a land of residual & slightly burnt sugars. Sweet apple pieces, apple pie filling, honey, & even a touch of white wine-like acidity near the finish.

Or maybe with that smell of apple being mixed up with the most expensive honey you can imagine. The only thing you can (worry) about is the sweetness in the taste. The rest is unimaginable and pure apple with syrup and honey. With some alcohol. With the most unbelievable quaffyness you can imagine. I have never tried anything comparable to that one.

103,"2013-11-13",3.6,"Had the unfortunate experience of trying this at the same time as the winter harvest, which is miles better (and priced accordingly). Straightforward apple aroma. Light Golden brown color. Taste is intensely sweet, perhaps too much so. Strong apple flavors that are fairly straightforward and ciderly. Not quite as complex and unique as I was expecting. Pay the extra money for the winter harvest, it's worth it. This, however, is not worth the steep price tag.

103,"2012-04-21",4.4,"Bottle. My first Ice Cider! How exciting! :-D Pours a clear, still light golden body. Aroma is intense, waxy tones of blue cheese and yeast. Hints of apples in the back. So strange, but not bad. When I take a sip, the whole experience is jacked into a high-voltage output - intensely semi-sweet apple tones spread out like a carpet, drilling an amazing multi-layered apple experience all over my unprepared tongue: apple juice concentrate, citric tones, hints of peaches and apricot. This is absolutely stunning. If someone slightly trustworthy would hand me this drink and tell me it was the sublime and true essence of APPLE I would buy that in a second. The blue cheese-like yeastiness comes back into play late in the palate, ensuring a smooth, strange and yet wonderful fade-out of the intense apple-ness. This most be a fantastic dessert companion, or maybe as a dessert itself. What a huge contrast between aroma and taste; the aroma was nice, but discreet. The taste: immense and easily recognizable, yet original at the same time. A great and unexpected taste experience for sure, and one I recommend anyone with a love for flavors to have for themselves. Sure the bottle is pricey, but this is definitely worth it. And more. :-)","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

The flavor is a pretty much perfect sweet, tart, fresh apple taste.  Wow.  The 12% ABV is definitely apparent but not at all in a negative way; warming, and rounds it out nicely.  Feels like a mix of apple juice and wine on the palate- no carbonation, smooth, and a little sticky, and I like what the warming alcohol does to the chilled liquid.

Deep golden hue (slightly darker than the1st) with very good oily legs.

The taste is where this shines, a wonderful balance between tart and sweet, you can taste the whole apple here, flesh, fruit and even core.

Appearance: 
1-3 are all very clear.   1 and 2 are a clear watery amber with 2 ever so slighly darker than 1.  3 was a clear golden yellow.  no head.  4 poured a hazy murky  pond water orange brown.  
 

more important stuff
1)  similar to 2.  more earthy, less tart.   found myself drinking this one the most.  kept coming back to it.  needed to get seconds of this.  the earthiest of the 4.  score: 4.1
2)  deep sweet apple goodness.  more tart than than 1.  both are solid.  more complex than 1.  The tartness really gives a nice layer to this.  tight.   score: 4.5

4)  sweetest of the 4.  stands out as being a lot different than the other three.  a caramel candied apple sugar sweetness.  nice. caramel, sweet aple crisp.

Applejuice, wood, sauteed apples (in cinnemon), pie crust, earth, and something very close to grass and hay.  Tastes  like a sweet syupy apple juice, with wood, cinnemon, butterscotch, candy coating, and is more sweet than tart.  Finishes a bit cloying and clean of flavor.  The wood and the sugar remain on the mouth while the tongue tastes the apples, but its a subtle finish.  Sticky body, but not as viscous or thick as a port.  You can take big sips if you want.

This cider pours honey-colored and without the slightest hint of haze.  There are small round perfectly clear bubbles riding on top along the rim.  The aroma has apple, of course, along with a touch of brown sugar, olive oil and a cross between pineapple and asparagus.  The body is thick and coating and has a consistency like apple meat liquefied.  There is a noticeable alcohol bite at the end.  The taste is very tart at first but a thick stream of sweetness quickly rushes in to even things out.  This is an extremely well-balanced cider.  Everything is smooth and tasty.

103,"2008-09-07",4.1,"375mL bottle from the LCBO (I know? Right?!?). So for $29.95 this had better not disappoint, and it doesnt. However it still has give me one hell of a fun and wild and messy time. So apparently Im terrible at removing corks that dont stick out of the bottle at all. Damn. Anyways, this deep gold liquid decants nicely into my snifter, and DAMN check out those legs! Sexy. Incredibly moderate carbonation also, which kind of surprised me. Aroma is like getting punched in the face by some enraged apple-picking labourer with a sack of freshly picked apples, but for some reason you love it? The flavour is like that again, but even harder. Starts out unbelievably sweet, like some sort of apple orgy in your mouth, and then to balance the whole show out youre hit with some really nice sour tartness. Sour green apples, maybe a hint of apple crumble, but mainly just a ridiculous amount of apple goodness. Damn, this stuff is intense, and delicious. Very nice drinking experience, and apparently I have to finish the whole thing now because I sort of destroyed the cork. The alcohol is very well hidden in amidst the abundant flavour.

The flavor follows suit with the blend of sweet apples and candied sugar pushing through first follwed by the tartness of some granny smith flavors. The flavor is truly decadent on a dessert level. It has a full bodied mouthfeel that is very smooth and viscous that goes down so easily with sweet/tart apple flavor left behind and a touch of alcohol warmth.

Essentially, its virtues are as follows - you cannot taste the 12% alcohol at all!  Not one bit.  No, seriously.  Now for the downside: Neige tastes like Motts apple juice.  No kidding.  Theres little in the way of complexity, and because its flat, you dont even get the enjoyment out of it that would come from a glass of Woodpecker Cider.  Very, very disappointing.  By the way, its not even all that sweet.  Its got about the same tartness as a can of MinuteMaid applejuice that youd get on a United flight.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"

103,"2007-12-25",4.2,"2005 vintage.  Pours a crystal clear light golden color.  The body is 99.9% still, though the occasional bubble escapes from the gathering that collects near the bottom of the cordial glass.  Though not as thick as its big brother, Frimas, the Neige sports syrupy legs that cling to the glass well, foreshadowing the inevitably luxurious mouthfeel.  The aroma boasts a full-on concentrated apple assault, with seemingly every variety of the fruit, from crisp Washington to tangy Granny Smith on full display.  The flavor follows suit exactly, though the concentration and tangy subtleties intensify.  A smooth, viscous, almost creamy mouthfeel borders on perfect, though falls just short (perhaps only because I know the Frimas is even more decadent).  This is truly awesome stuff that I would love to be able to have on a more frequent basis.  As it stands, I feel very fortunate that I am in a position to enjoy on special occasions.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

103,"2007-12-11",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2009 In short: Archetypical classic Ice-Cider.  The measuring stick of the style.  Excellent.
How: Many times.  Lately I had the three Face Cachée de la Pomme classics (Neige, Neige Éternelle and Frimas) side by side at Montreals Flaveurs, Bières and Caprice Festival 2007.
The look: Golden-yellow body with no head.
In long: After 1300+ ratings heres my first ice-cider rating.  Almost shameful since I live in the land of ice-ciders.  I feel like a Texas fifth-grader whos not yet familiar with firearms.  Anyway very sweet with dominant flavours of apple skin (red apples mainly) and hard-candies.  Mouthfeel is oily and silky.  Surprisingly smooth.  The smoother of the Face Cachée lineup.  There really aintt that much to say about ice-ciders as they have a very linear and focussed flavour spectrum.  Excellent nonetheless.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

There is so much taste going on here that theres almost no way to discern how much alcohol is involved.","Kirkland, Washington, USA","bitbucket"
103,"2007-11-04",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2012 Courtesy of after4ever and shared with after4ever and bitbucket. Pours a watery clear gold. The aroma is green and red delicious apples mixed with a copious amount of red apple skins and some faint chemical alcohol notes. The taste throws back the senses into a tail spin from the bitingly bold flavor. It starts very thick and viscous, nearly sludgy, carrying a bout load of apples followed by hints of alcohol. The flavor is highly concentrated-condensed apples. The alcohol does create an odd almost chemical note but it doesnt interfere with the experience much.
Another sampling of this.  Pours clear deep gold with impressive sludgy legginess. The aroma pushes up rich sweet apple nectar along with tart apple skin like tannins followed by a bit of chemical booze to almost a cotton ball sensation. The rich taste goes from slick apple nectar sweetness and runs straight into tart green apple juice notes. To midway and into the finish it lends out some booziness and then a bit more sweet sticky apple nectar sweetness. Dynamite.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Headless and laceless of course, fair amount of leg showing against the side of the glass. Sharp green apple nose; tart fruit sugar and red apple in there as well. Light, vanishing presence on the tongue, along with a denser, more syrupy settling sensation on the floor of the mouth. Its like it breaks into lots of different little pieces in different parts of the mouth; some sugary, some puckery, some effervescent, some concentrated. Very dimensional apple presence at every stage. Long, sticky, sugary finish.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Pours a transparent gold and really coats the glass.  There are few large bubbles that almost instantly disappear for a head.  The flavor starts with an intense sugary apple sweetness that quickly turns very tart and sour apple candy-like with some acidity in the finish.  There is a definite warming affect and very faint burn, but no alcohol flavor to speak of whatsoever.  There is the slightest hints of cinnamon in the finish.  Slick oily mouthfeel.

Pausing over the glass for a minute or so brought notes, no evocations, of all things apple.  Dances between pie, cobbler, sauce, fresh picked and orchard cider.  Hints of cinnamon.  A thin syrup that dissolves mercurially with tiny carb fireworks and a tongue numbing tang.  After 5 minutes of nasal foreplay the first sip is apple orgasm.   Ive had great apples but the saturation and complexity of the Neige is almost otherwordly.  Sweet and sour rise and fall and linger long with more subtle apple.  Incredible.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"

Color is a beautiful deep orange to coppery golden color.  Aroma is basically pure apple, with just the slightest hint of mulling spices.  Flavor is also incredibly apple, again with a hint of mulling spices.  It literally does taste exactly like non-alcoholic apple cider, or perhaps the condensed liquids of apple pie.

Somewhat tart and mildly sweet, the nose is grand and intense enough to mask the higher alcohol levels well. The nose is very fresh and superior in its cleanliness. The flavor is clean as well and much the same as the aroma. Moderately sweet, lightly sticky, mild acidity cutting through the sweetness. An addition of light spice marches forward in intensity with each sip. Alcohol is completely hidden in the taste. A light hint of white pepper ushers in a soft and elegant finish that has great length and is very crisp, extremely refreshing for something thats is the ultimate result of such condensing of fruit and sugars. The mouthfeel is as soft as snowflakes, lightly syrupy but not enough to be bothersome at all. Awesome cider.","Alabama, USA","boboski"
103,"2007-06-26",4.4,"375ml bottle from robinvboyer.  Aroma:  Intense apple aroma from the moment I popped the cork.  Green apples.  Equal parts sweet and tart.

Starts out fairly sweet with some dried apricot notes, but finishes with a nice tart bite.  Some light spice and a slight  touch of yeast.  Tart and dry finish with alot of apple flavor carrying over.  The flavor hangs with you a long time.  Excellent.  Palate:  Medium bodied.  No carbonation.  Pleasant alcohol burn in the back of mouth.  Overall:  I was expecting something similar to an Ice Wine with this.  It was much better than most of the Ice Wines Ive had the chance to try.

And that the time youre spending right now is somehow wasted if you dont feel its being spent in the service of getting you to that thing?

Well, thats exactly how I felt. At least until I tried the Neige Ice Cider.

Appearance: Pours a clear, still golden body.

Smell: A fruity, earthy aroma of a fine cheese course served alongside candied apples, honey, flowers, and vanilla beans.

Taste: Ultra-condensed, outstandly sweet apple juice, like the distilled spirit of Johnny Appleseed! Lush undertones of honey and vanilla. Hints of citrus and nutmeg. While there is a bit of tartness, it ultimately gives way to the liqueur-like sweetness. Yet it still manages to relatively finish both crisp and clean.

Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Syrupy mouthfeel, though the alcohol helps to keep things moving along nicely. 

Drinkability: Finally, someone rightfully decided to give the noble apple the dessert wine treatment.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

103,"2007-05-13",4.5,"bottle (200ml, clear).  Via trade with mouton_noire.  Rating #2200.  ""Récolte 2005.""  Pours oily-looking clear refractive brass-gold, no head, no bubbles, but from what I know of ice wines, this is exactly as it should be.  The aroma is initially mild (needed to warm), eventually it opened to reveal a complex combination of sweet ripe apple, a little brown sugar, some bone-dry musty white wine and a hint of tartness.  Taste - just wow.  Who would ever drink ice wine again after this?  Smooth, silky, real-apple, sweet but not cloying, a hint of light spice hovering in the background, warming but muted alcohol, no aftertaste (other than apple), no burn - man thats a fine thing.  Silky, sticky body - neither thick nor watery, just perfect, really, not carbonated but thats not the point here, it just sits on the tongue and you mourn its passing and realize why its so expensive.

103,"2007-05-05",4.1,"5/4/07.  Poured out of 200 mL bottle, obtained in a trade with Olivier_MTL on RateBeer 12/3/05.  2005 Vintage.  Lovely, luminescent, crystalline golden color, completely still (as expected) and with several silky viscous legs on the sides of the glass.  Aroma is of tart green apples, a little bit of a Jolly Rancher fakeness to it but mostly just bright, zippy crisp sour apple.  Theres also a touch of alcohol burn in the nose that either dissipates quickly through evaporation or fades into the apple tartness and tickles my nose into submission.  I really cant tell exactly, but I think theres a little of both going on.  The beautiful thing about this stuff is how well-integrated all of the flavors are, and at 12% ABV the alcohol is one of the primary among them.  The taste captures a lot of the same apple candy and fresh juice with some mead-like honey character, then a very soft touch of earthiness and apple skin down the finish.  Medium length on the finish with a slightly sticky, sappy residue left on the lips.  Slick medium body with a fuzzy burn down the throat and gentle warmth on the sides of the mouth.  It may be funny to say with such a sweetly fruity concoction, but if the finish were a bit drier, this stuff would be even more lovely.  A real treat for a grown-up juice lover looking for a new indulgence.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

This pours an orangey slight yellow mix with a thin soapy head that is whisked quickly away. Aroma is apples, tartness, alcohol, grapey-goodnesses thereof, some hints of honey and mahogany. WOW, no wonder this runs so much a bottle...that was perhaps the smoothest 12% ABV I have EVER experienced. Tart and extremely crisp, flavors are long developing with a bittering dew drop ending. Thick and syrupy with just the slightest warming of alcohol, no carbonation necessary. Oh god this is nice. Apples suddenly dont suck anymore. Finish is extremely crisp, and chewy....mmmmmmmm.

103,"2007-04-11",4.4,"Tasting from bottle in Orlando, courtesy the ever so hospitable boboski. A cider? A style I sort of mock for being on these beer sites. However, giving Jason the benefit of doubt, I figured it would be a fine experience anyway. That was an underestimation, as this thing turned my eye open to the cider world moving forward. Complexity clearly wasnt there like a fantastic beer, but boy, this thing was ever so smooth and fine. A beautiful golden color, a very enticing candied-apple aroma with a flavor that just beautifully engaged nose and tongue. Im not sure how other ciders will stack up against this one, but Im gonna have to shoot for some stuff in between this and Woodchuck (haha), see how the other upper end products do (hopefully better than the mead world has been for me between Jadiwaga and Mead X).

Wow, from the aroma I wasnt expecting a ton, but the flavor is frickin amazing.  The alcohol is noticeable, but theres so much sweetness and tartness that it never burns or detracts, but complements.  Sweet finish.  Apples linger in the mouth for a looooong time.  Full syrupy body with no carbonation.  Would be an excellent digestif or with some good stinky strong cheese, as peter already suggested.  The best cider Ive ever had--totally awesome.

I cant identify all the components, but its heady!  The flavor is even more intense.  I made the mistake of taking a good-sized swallow, and it was way too much!  As suspected, its thick and syrupy, like an intense dessert wine, a little too syrupy for me.  The flavors are magical; Ive never tasted any cider that even came close.

My wife and I were out for diner at a nice seafood place Maestro SVP and they had a cider on special. I asked if they had iced cider and they did, it was C$8.50 a glass. Pretty much around the same price as their inexpensive wines. My wife and I both loved it, such a treat. I brought home a big, 500ml bottle for us, and I brought back a couple 50ml bottles for raters, me included. I served the cider at 35°/2°C in a flute glass. The cider is gold, looks like most white wines. When swirled, the cider coats the glass. The aroma is tart, steely apples with some            baked apple flavor far in the background. The cider is very sweet initially, but that is quickly replaced by citrus, lemon,  tart apples and a touch of cleansing alcohol.

Dangerous drinkability, considering the amount of alcohol and the price, but God, this stuff is good!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
103,"2005-06-13",3.8,"2004 bottle, sampled at Mondial, 6/4/05.  Very light pinot-grigio-like color, with just a touch of light tangerine juice color, adding a bit more depth.  Little to no legs on the glass.  Aroma is flowery, peachy and very simple.  Sweet apple juice, bits of funky mushed apples, golden delicious apple-skins and vanilla.  Flavor has plenty of apple-juice notes, clear, crisp and clean, with yellow apples, apple sauce and light dry yeast notes.  A touch of more concentrated honeyish sugar and alcohol on the finish, light vanilla, cloves/nutmeg and a warming sensation are felt.  Light textured and very belying the 12 abv, not syrupy nor cloying.  Easy drinking ice-cider.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

103,"2005-05-09",4.0,"Bottle: Poured a dark yellow still cider. Aroma of sweet concentrated apple juice with a liquorish feel to it. Taste is sweet though not overly sweet with a discreet warming feeling from the alcohol. I have no problem of believing that 3kg of apple are include in this bottle. Very good stuff overall.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
103,"2005-04-29",4.1,"Perfect golden color, clear, calm in the glass, majestuous when shaken, displaying small legs. Aroma feels like pure apple flesh, sweet and in control, liqurous, but just enough. Nevertheless, it doesnt strike me down in awe. The flavor comes closer. Condensed apples glory. Classy alcohol feel over rhubarb, pie crust, cloves, pear skin notes, The texture is very oily and thus reminds a bit of nuts. Gentle tart aspect, though nowhere near refreshing. Intense mouth presence, limiting its syrupy sweetness on the verge of ""non-cloyingness"".  JW Lees of ciders mouthfeel wise. Splendid ice cider, glorious apple showdown! I wish I could find 45$ in the street to rush and buy their Frimas.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
103,"2005-04-26",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 10, 2007 Pours a clear golden color. Aroma of baked apples. Excellent sweet and acind flavor of baked apples with a bitter finish.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
103,"2005-02-16",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 28, 2005 50 ml sample bottle.  Oily clear light gold, legs of icicle last and last....the nose uncovers deep wafts of baked apple, alcohol and a touch of cinnamon...the tongue responds with thick juiciness and surprisingly little alcohol flavor for 12%, a wonderful sweet/sour balance of apples, no metallic twinges as I often find in strong ciders and meads, and interesting hints of sourdough and pepper near the finish in a slightly oily, thick body.  Delightful.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
103,"2005-02-13",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 26, 2005 Looks like translucent liquid gold.  Older vintages tend to darken a bit.  A big splash of apple in the nose, with other sweet hints hidden here and there, vanilla and oak notes as well.  The first sip is like a million apples got concentrated into a single drop that explodes the instant it hits your tongue.  Im not a big apple juice drinker, but the balance of tart and sweet makes this ice cider totally worth it.  To feel it ice cold in your mouth and come down warm and soothing down your throat is a totally unique experience.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"
103,"2004-06-12",3.8,"Mild, sweet strong apples in the nose. Clear, deep golden. Still and viscous. Sweet apples - liqueur-like flavour. Full-bodied. Gentle alcohol warming. Bottle (sampled at Mondial 2004).","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
103,"2004-02-19",3.7,"(200ml bottle) Pours an oily textured, amber body. Slight sedimentation. Nose of sweet macintosh apples and wood. Sweet flavour is nicely balanced by a tart undertone. So easy to drink that I may finish the bottle tonight. Delicious!","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
