3434,"2017-04-16",3.9,"375mL bottle from Carwyn Cellars. Batch no 4
Body is a dirty red stained golden colour - looks beautiful from afar - with dense white head.
Yeah righto, its funky - whiff of acetic acid & ethyl acetate straight up hits me for six upfront, I recompose myself and the aroma reveals hard cheese, yoghurt, sour dough bread starter, amongst some vinous red fruit, cherry pip & oaken toast character.
Theres good weight here, and a tremendous, slightly ropey, vinous acidity - sort of akin to a young Pinot Noir in some regard - tannic too, the texture is something intriguing.
Immensely complex palate - heady acetate notes, mature washed rind, panicked horse locked in a stuffy stable, grapefruit rind/pith, Pinot Noir-esque cherry, old charred oak, blackened ripe tomato (?), sort of an unripe raspberry, blue cheese, some cut dried herbs (i dunno, lavender!?). Bracing acidity, very long on the finish yet so very easy to drink.
This is quite marvellous really - every once of my winemakers mind wants to tell me this is a nightmare, but it tastes so good!","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"
3434,"2017-04-01",4.4,"The Final Beer of my #6000 celebration (#13 of 13 - six beers on either side of 6000 and the milestone itself). Deep clear, but ever so slightly muddied ruby and almost violet hued body with a thinnish, fast-dying tan head, only about a centimetre tall. Aroma of cherries, sour grapes, oak, cedar, dry grass, funk, brett, lactic acid and a ton of mouthwatering soured fruit notes - very nice smelling and complex! Light-bodied; Biting acidic sourness up front with a lot of fruit elements, but citric acid is noticeable along with a very smooth cherry sweetness along with some raspberries, but the sour flavours hit the tongue first and leave it very nice. Aftertaste shows a bit more of a nuanced flavour with dry oak, cedar and funk noticeable, but the cherry sweetness hits through and the sourness and funk are the strongest - all derived from soured fruits and some light oak notes. Overall, a very enjoyable beer with a great sour flavour that ends nicely, slightly dry, but mouth-watering and making you immediately have another sip - a great example of the style and well worth trying if you can find it, even if you dont like the style, since its a prototypical example of it. I sampled this 37,5 cL bottle purchased from Whole Foods in New York (Columbus Circle), New York on 19-December-2015 for US$11,99 sampled at home in Washington on 31-March-2017 as Beer #6006, the #13th and last of my celebration for #6000!","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

3434,"2016-01-01",3.1,"UPDATED: JAN 2, 2016 Sour ale from a bottle bought online. Medium thin but reasonably steady, egg-white, moussy head over a misty amber coloured beer with ochre hue. Complex sweet with sour aroma of passion fruit, sour cherries, strawberry pie, brown sugar, artisanal fruit yoghurt, mouldy orange, brown bread, stewed pear, old sherry, overripe gooseberry, gingerbread, peach, medlar. Sour onset, passion fruit, a ton of unripe stonefruit and redcurrant in the most literal sense of the word, lime too as if youve just bitten into a fresh one, insufficiently tempered with a very subtle apricot sweetishness, softish carbo, smooth honeyish and caramelly maltiness underlying this array of sourish fruits, bit sherryish too, progressing into a finish of strong drying grape-, lime- and redcurrant-like tartness, sherry vinegar-like flavours and a hint of red wine including the woody tannins, but gently so; hops are only structural, as expected from the style. Leaves a long but relatively simple acidity after swallowing with a light woody drought alongside, as if you just poured down a really dry red wine. Interesting, but enjoyed by itself, like I did just now, this seems to fall short a bit in complexity, flavour layers and finesse. It is a good thing American craft brewers try to master sour beer styles, but this is a tad too harsh and straightforward to my palate - and being Belgian, I think I have a good idea of what a good sour beer should taste like. This is a crude onslaught to the stomach and needs a lot more refinement, but in a gastronomical context e.g. paired with a very sweet dessert, I can see this function very well.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

3434,"2015-12-09",3.8,"Ive had a penchant for sour these last couple of weeks, and although Ive been drinking other styles, Ive been craving these. Breakfast and lunch go by and I realize that all I want to do with my afternoon is find a great sour style and just savor it. This is my choice for tonight, and as soon as I open the bottle, I know Ive made a good choice.
- As I pour the beer, I bend a little aggressive to drive the aroma up and out of the glass; tonight, maybe Im just a little greedy. The red wine and cherries are distinct, but the lactic acid is a force to be reckoned with, the tartness of the combination is mouth-watering even before I can wrap my lips around the first sip.
- The flat, red-amber of the body is not capped, but a ring of cream-colored, soapy foam girdles the inside of the glass, becoming thicker with each movement and subsiding again. Even as I lift the beer to my lips, the head rises; tipping to drink coats the walls of the glass with a wet, heavy foam that sinks back into the beer in a matter of moments.
- A jaw-cracking sour fiends on the soft flesh of my mouth, assaulting the underside of my tongue with acidic fruits and oak-laden wine. A thin line of goose bumps runs down my spine, reaching out to trace my shoulders to fingertips. Damn, I needed this. My mouth soon adapts to the blitzkrieg and the oak and lactic acid become much more obvious in both the aroma and flavor.
- A clean, dry finish, full of woody earth and sweet dough is a welcome experience, and since this is readily available, Ill be making this a go-to sour red in my cooler.","USA","lightbias"

Series"" entry comes to you from a batch 2 bottle (I think approaching 3 years old), drunk 9/24/15.Clear rosy-pink body is not the deep cherry red of some cherry beers yet it certainly is not golden. Pink-flecked head atop is initially large but rapidly recedes to cover.Both cherry and grape are represented in the nose, the grape being laced with wood tannin and plentiful lactic notes are present. Quite funky, but all things fairly well-integrated, all told. Obviously, at almost three years, theres not going to be much cherry left, but what is, is still clean and authentic. Malts are quite sparse, with crackers, light biscuits and almost no sweetness. No alcohol or flaws.Very tart up front, with both malic and lactic acids attacking the palate and building up in to an intensely sour finish. Dry wood tannin, tart cherries and light vinousness all tip the scales to the very dry end of the spectrum, to say nothing of the bacterial acidity. Obviously a bit past its prime and whatever maltiness was present is now utterly devoured. Still, the flavors are true and enjoyable and had I been a responsible beer drinker and not aged it, Im sure it would have been incredible.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3434,"2014-01-19",3.4,"Sampled at Eastside Clube Tavern, Olympia WA
Arrives from the tap with a soft amber color and is topped by a 1/4-finger thick, lightly tan colored head. The aroma has a nice, chewy tartness that seems to be a mix of lactic and acetic acidities. There is a backbone of hay like, and a touch of cracker like malt character here, and a general, sort of grassy quality that is a combination of both the malt and the fermentation character. The nose has quite a bit of fruit character to it really, perhaps some tart cherry, a definite sour berry note, and some musty mellon like character as well.

The beer is soft up front, but has a gripping sourness towards the finish. Pretty well carbonated, and the acidity accentuates the prickly nature of this beer. There is a rounded fruitiness here that is a mix of tart pear notes, start fruit, and some tart currant notes. The body has a light fullness to it, this isnt heavy, but certainly is not a beer to quaff a whole lot of either. There is a backbone of wood here that provides some spiciness, a tannic, astringent body accentuating character, as well as a touch of fresh wood flavors.

An interesting beer to try when you are hankering for something sour. It could be a bit more funky, but is pretty tasty overall.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3434,"2013-11-07",3.6,"375 ml bottle courtesy of a BA trade. Pours a nicely hazed copper red hue, some pinkish rosey glow with orange copper edges and bottom. Frothy offwhite head is fairly carbonation driven, dies to a smaller ring, laces small. Darker middle, well hazed tapers out to a nice glow. Aromas are nice cherries, sweeter pie cherries meet tart cherry, cherryskin, red and blush wine, decent oak and lactic elements. Lemon, yogurt, gentle toasty and biscuity malt element is softened by firm oak and wine barrel, cherryskin and juice, firmer lactic presence. Some mandarin oranges, cranberry, some decent complexity if a bit sharp at times, fruit punchy feel at others. A mellow to subtle spiciness hits at times after it settles. Initial lighter end of medium bodied, firm tannic oak and red wine meets some cherryskin, decent tart and sour elements. Underlying touches of bread, biscuit, yogurt and firm sourness. A bit sharp, gentle metallic poke. A bit fuzzy,d ry and tannic as we keep moving on. Yogurt, lemony and lactic life. Cherries, red wine, a gentle touch of Rose and blush wine, decent carbonation and spritzy qualities as we round the corner into the back. Dry, tannic and lactic elements are nice, dryt this out into the back. A mellow carmelized and bready base pokes through gently, more of a compliment. Touches of cranberry tartness meet the cherries, red wine has some life, not overly tannic overall, but a lighter, thinner beer allows those elements to show some life overall if that makes sense.

The aroma is extremely saliva inducing - so sour, you get the wood and the sour cherries - the word ""spontaneous"" pops up hard. The taste; insanely sour, followed by by discrete wood and slight sweetness. Like a very sour red wine with sourdough bacterias. Not too complex, but heavenly tart!","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Enegaard"

Flavors are well integrated. Brown sugar complements the red fruits sourness. Rather full bodied. Although there is some caramel/brown sugar notes, it lacked sweetness to be considered a good example of the Flanders Red style. Although, it is not very sour nor vinegary compared to most attempts at the style from US brewers.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

Moderate carbonation. Slightly dry finish. Good Sour. Not sure this is a perfect example of a Flander Red, but its definitely a good Sour Ale with Cherries.

Medium-full body, light carbonation, thick and mouth-coating without being sticky. Overall - on the sweet side, and not crazy about the aftertaste, but decent. Stoked about almanac's arrival in WA!

3434,"2013-07-30",3.7,"Aroma is moderately acidic with a faint acetic character and moderate wine barrel notes including some tannins. Light cherry note and a moderately strong ester similar to over ripe melons. Its odd as the melon character is stronger than the cherries. Its missing some of the malt character I would expect in some Flanders style beers. 
Pours a cloudy, murky light brown with a pinkish red hue with a somewhat thin, light tan head that recedes fairly quickly to the edges. 
Flavor is lightly sweet with moderate acidity. Moderate barrel quality which comes across stronger than the cherries. Medium light malt character adds some complexity. Light bitterness. Finish is sweet with some tannins and light acidity. The cherry notes really hit mid-palate and do break through everything else but they dont hang around long. Dark fruit complexity isnt up to that of a Flanderss style beer. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. I have read of slightly undercarbed bottles but this isnt one of them. Light astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall another enjoyable sour but its not awe inspiring and for a dollar more I think I would rather drink Russian River. I also have a hard time reconciling this with Flanderss style sours as it really lacks the malt character that you would find in a beer true to that style.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3434,"2013-07-28",4.1,"Bottle poured into Duvel tulip. Pours a murky orange-brown with tan head. Aroma is part tart and part sweet -- lactic acid, underripe cherries and slight vinegar for the tartness, and butter, honey and melon for the sweetness. Flavor has a unique but slightly understated Rainier cherry character, sweet and fleshy but very obviously not black or maraschino cherry like many other Flemish-style sours have. Theres a significant oaky buttery note throughout, but it isnt really off-putting. It lends a honeycomb aftertaste that competes with cherry pits and fermented strawberries in the finish. Im also getting a sort of milky lactose mouthfeel with a drying sensation, like if youve ever added honey and milk to a cup of tea. I like this beer more and more as I go along. Overall a unique mix of lactic acid and lactose notes with a moderate amount of fruitiness.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
