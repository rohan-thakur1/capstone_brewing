2477,"2015-04-11",3.6,"Sötét, rubinos árnyalatokat megcsillantó testtel tűnik elő a duplabakként megjelölt Mikkeller specialitás, ujjnyi vastag, bézs színű habot produkálva. Kissé meglepő módon leginkább fekete ipák tapasztalása során felbukkanó sötét hangulatú, egyszerre pirított és komlós világú, növényes aromájú, ázott szegfűszáras jegyeket megcsillantó illatok kerülnek előtérbe, melyek mellett egy kevés karamell és csokoládéba burkolt maláta is leteszi vaskos kontúrral meghúzott névjegyét. Közepes testét éjfekete csokoládé, ízlésesen pörkölt maláta, nem utolsó sorban pedig karcos komló szerkezete feszíti meg, mely utóbbi elem számomra legalábbis igencsak főszereplője az előadásnak. Korántsem állítom, hogy stílusidegen jegyek uralmától terhes főzettel van dolgunk, mindenesetre egy, a szokásosnál talán komló-központúbb alkotásról beszélhetünk, már amennyiben utunkat a duplabakok specifikus komponensei által kitaposott ösvényen kívánjuk bejárni. A dán Megváltó ez esetben és ebben az értelemben tehát nem feltétlenül mutat rokonságot német megfelelőjével, s bár összességében egy remek italról van szó, ha a kategória keretein belül szemlélődve járunk el, nem biztos, hogy otthonosan érezzük majd magunkat. Ettől elvonatkoztatva azonban feltétlenül megéri elmerülni a kakaós, pirított magvas, karamellás és szigorú arculatú komlós egyvelegben, mely önmagában véve egy szertelenül hibátlan remekmű.","HUNGARY","adster"

An expensive price tag knocks this down a few pegs from an excellent beer to middle of the pack. While I understand the markup (small brewery, distance of distribution, and so on) it just comes across as a little underwhelming. That wont stop me from buying the occasional Mikkeller but I wont be buying them frequently.

Aroma / Appearance - A rich chocolately base looks like a bottle of watered down syrup. Long inky legs betray the ABV. Chocolate in the nose is fine but this suffers the fate of many huge doppelbocks - that tinge of soy. Less alcohol might have brought this down a notch.

Flavor / Palate - Chocolate, malt balls, and that distracting soy flavor alternate between good and bad. The thick texture of the mouthfeel requires some patience. For the ABV it does not overwhelm as much as some other Mikkeller beers. Even so it is an average doppelbock at best.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

2477,"2012-05-07",3.9,"750ml bottle Pours a dark brown clouded lager in the stein with a 3 finger frothy cap that lasts well and laces the glass.  Soft carbonation. Aroma is slightly understated when chilled  dark cocoa, sweet bready malts, some noble earthiness light whiff of fusel alcohol.
Big rich chewy malts in front  chocolate, nutty bready with some figs and treacle all balanced well with some really resinous hopping = goes to a long roasty bitter finish with a metallic hop aftertaste. Wow a big beer. But is it a dark (dunkler) triple bock or just a hoppy version of a Baltic porter.

2477,"2012-04-17",1.9,"UPDATED: APR 19, 2012 750mL bottle that I probably shouldnt have got into tonight, nor purchased in the first place. Pours a hazy, dark reddish brown with a large beige head. Aroma is full of fruity malty aspects, as well as that weird, sweet malty character that I get from Mikkeller that is kind of hard to describe but always reminds me of tasting sessions that have gone way too far. Flavour is your standard malt bomb, vague Bock elements thrown in with arguably overly sweet Mikkeller malt aspects. Too much booze on the palate, just staring you right in the face. Dark fruits and what not blah blah blah. Pretty much every beer I have from this brewery is either over-attenuated and tastes like ink, or like this, possibly under-attenuated and loaded with residual and un-fermented sugars. Call me a dick, but everything Ive had from them seems like they need to severely restrain themselves, or more importantly, REFINE THE EVER-LOVING F*** OUT OF THEIR BREWING TECHNIQUES. For how many pointless collaborations they seem to do, they never seems to learn anything, and always end up with the same shit regarding their own brews. Jesus Fucking Christ, Protestant or Catholic. There is some complexity here, but it seems merely coincidental. Also, stop charging $600 a bottle and maybe youd be on the right track. Mikkeller, because of you, I generally dont bother with Danish beers any more because I know Ill probably end up disappointed. Its like, ""Hey, heres an awesome beer style that doesnt get much appreciation. Lets just take a massive dump all over everything it stands for! Yeah!"".","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

I tried this beer on April 13, 2012 after purchasing from the Royal Bank Plaza LOCBO outlet in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The beer poured a sold dark brown colour with a long lasting foamy dark tan coloured head.  Aroma was dark fruit, yeast, roasted malt, and brown sugar.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied, and creamy.

Just a hint of carbonation to keep it from being lifeless, body is a touch thin but not really an issue.  Heavy on the malts and some unexpected mellow fruit sweetness, raisins/prunes?  Gives way to a bready, astringent and boozy finish.  Could possibly benefit from some aging as the ethanol finish was a little too sharp for my liking.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Krypes"

Pours a very dark brown color with a good off-white head and a bit of light lacing. The nose is roasty with a touch of sweetness and some dark fruits. There is also a very small amount of smokey character in the background. The taste is lightly smoked and roasty and also carries a nice dark fruit presence. Impressively, the alcohol in this is not really all that detectable. The body is medium and the finish is dry, which some plum character being accentuated in the finish.

2477,"2011-02-10",2.9,"In short: An overly boozy, very roasted and aggressive strong dark lager beer of some kind
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed a little over one year after it was first bottled, 1.5 year before expiration date.

In long: Nose is vinous, some raisins and some barley candies.  Taste has a lot of burnt caramel, some prunes, raisins, nail polish, rubber, chalk.  Very astringent.  I was surprised at the roasted level of this beer and it didnt fit the style well with plenty of burnt caramel and burnt brown sugar in lieu of a rich caramelized body.  Body wasnt rich enough and alcohol was annoyingly apparent with a higher alcohol/fusel sensation.  I drank a full bottle a few hours after drinking a superior example of the same style (Cheval Blanc Triple Bock) so it made Frelser even more disappointing.

I have scribbled down that there was something vaguely ""Euro"" in this beer but not sure if I was referring to the malts or hops.  Medium-bodied, with mild carbonation and a toasty, malty mouthfeel.  One of the guys drinking this was calling it a ""triple bock"", as its an imperial doppelbock, more or less.

2477,"2010-10-18",3.3,"750ml bottle.  The pour yields a deep, inky, violet-burgundy body with a thin, bubbly head of dark khaki froth.  A solid, unbroken sheet of lacing coats the glass almost entirely.  The aroma is loaded with dark fruits, overflowing with stewed raisins and figs in the forefront, followed by some tempered cocoa roast, toasted tree nuts, and some boozy, sherry-like character.  Earthen hops are present, but primarily serve a backup role to the mostly sweet fruitiness.  Flavors comes through with monstrously sweet caramel malt, again with dark, stewed, concentrated raisins, figs, and dates.  Toasted nuts, mild hops, and some earthy, dry, yeasty bread are all that keep this from being over-the-top sugary.  The palate sports a big body that is thinned only by the excessive alcohol, which brings a warm to hot, boozy finish.  Carbonation is moderate an unobtrusive.  Overall, there is good fruit depth and some supportive roast character, but the sweetness and booziness ultimately serve as detractors.  Decent, but far from great.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Explosive munich character in the nose feels like whole-grain bread, milk chocolate and roasted nuts. Dates and prunes fruitiness remain in the background. Fusel touches get kinda plasticy. It gets very alcoholic as it warms, initially containing its 11% impressively well, but heating up, becoming more insistent. Its saving grace has got to be its relatively balanced sweetness-dryness ratio. It is very sweet indeed, but far from the levels of its peers - Samichlaus and its descendants. The finish is mostly about alcohol, lingeringly so and the shy leafy hops remain a non factor. I reckon this is pretty well done and actually almost top of its slim class of very strong dark lagers, but it does not have much of what I look for in a beer: an enveloping freshness, feeling the ingredients, focus-or-complexity, etc.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

2477,"2010-08-29",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
This Imperial Stout-meets-Doppelbock proposes Munich and chocolate malts along raisiny caramel, while alcohol heat and herbal hop bitterness seal each sip with authority.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the brown-hinged blackness.
-Even though this is a mighty brew, it is not too sweet (which I appreciate).
-The soft effervescence makes each rather easy drinking for an 11% lager.
-This is as well executed as any other Mikkeller brew, but the recipe itself is not as compelling as some of his best work.

2477,"2010-07-14",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 20, 2010 It pours with a deep garnet color with a full, pillowy, fluffy, tan head which is mostly diminishing and leaves some scattered lace.  The nose is still premature but still bursting with flavor; spicy phenols, some herbal/perfumey hop notes, fruit cake, candied currants, caramel, almonds, and light roast.  The flavor is much different with more of the dark malt notes and less fruity esters and hops; toasted almonds are prominent, mild coffee roast, dark breads, toasted caramel, light currant notes, faint herbal hops, and still a chocolate cake tinge.  The palate is warm, nearly full, soft to lively, and velvety, almost round (in time, I think the palate could be perfect).  The finish is very long with toasted almonds, mild coffee, chocolate cake, and an herbal hop bitterness that stays on the tongue.  A wonderfully interesting beer with a flavor that was completely different from the nose.  The moderate bitterness to the beer was only noticed seconds after the finish because the flavor seemed to be completely malt dominated.  If only I had waited another year to pop this one; it was a bit young still but things are coming together nicely.  I am a bit curious about the label which says, ""trippelbock""; I would take that to mean a Belgian trippel brewed in the bock style, but I guess with the 11% it could mean a triple bock.  Either way it contained great characteristics of both and Mikkeller again surprises me with another great beer.
