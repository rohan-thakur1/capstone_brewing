Decent fluffy off white cobwebby head as well.  Aroma is cookie-dough, yeasty, bready, lightly sweet , hints of caramel, and a bit musty.  Good doughy full flavor, lightly sweet malts, toffee, hints of phenolics, and a light tart citrus character in the end which made it nice and refreshing.

Flavor followed suit, all of that with some tofee and light spice also mixed in there. Mouthfeel was dry, somewhat lightly acidic, moderate unfiltered body. A nice refreshing summer beer to enjoy.","","User37895"
