The aroma is interesting. This is more like a session IPA than a kolsch. Its hoppy and light with a nice wheat character. It is relatively light and crisp. The flavor has a lot more hop control. Its light and bitter up front. Smooth and light throughout. Its a good clean wheat and hop mixture. I like it.
