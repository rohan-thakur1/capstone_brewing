3904,"2016-08-28",4.0,"Bottle share. Pours a golden orange color with a moderate white head. Rich aroma of the stone fruits, mostly peaches. Lots of fruity sweet bits followed by funk and sour. A little bit of the oak barrel comes through, but this is mostly fruity and sour. Another solid DG Berliner.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
3904,"2016-07-19",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed at Dougs house for the Epic Peach and Apricot debacle of a tasting that happened on July 9. 750 mL bottle. This is the completion of the de Garde trifecta. The pour is a darker golden yellow color with a thick white head that slowly fizzles away to a film. The aroma is full of peaches. Hot damn. This one is potentially the brightest fruit of them all. The bright sourness exists and a light citrus peel exists as well. The flavors are a little more balanced. There is a decent sweetness from the fruit and a graininess that Im not crazy about. The mouth feel is awesome. There is a great crisp lightness to it with a bright carbonation and a lingeringly sour peach that lasts for days. The blend of apricot and peach here is a beautiful thing on the finish. I wish it did more of this in the actual beer.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3904,"2016-07-12",4.0,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is very fruity with quite a bit of apricots and peaches. Some lighter pineapple and citrus notes with a light yogurt character. Light wheat notes as well. A bit more apricots than peaches in the aroma. Some tannins from the skins and the oak. 
Pours a somewhat hazy, bright yellow gold with a medium sized, medium thick, white head that recedes quickly to the edges where it lingers for a bit. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor is fairly acidic, but not as sharp as the older de Garde sours. A light sweetness from the fruit and grain with a touch of a wheat note. Light oak and tannins from the oak and fruit skins. Moderate fruit notes with apricot leading the way with some peach behind it. Some light pineapple with medium citrus notes. A bit of an oily citrus note linger sin the finish along with some apricot and acid. 
Mouthfeel is light bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice stone fruit Bu. I really like that it seems more balanced than other de Garde beers. Balanced acidity and fruit with enough of the base berliner showing through. Hints of oak.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3904,"2016-07-09",4.2,"At the epic peach/apricot sour tasting. Aroma is peach crazy, apricot, sour, wheat, funk. Appearance is hazy, dark golden straw, white head.

3904,"2016-06-06",3.7,"750mL bottles sampled on two different occasions. Cloudy peach pour with little foam. Nose is quite green with underripe nectarine. In another bottle sample, the aroma brought forth impressive fuzzy peach and dried apricot. In flavor, it is super sour, pretty one note on the lemon citric front. There is certainly some peach/nectarine juiciness, but it is hard to enjoy.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3904,"2016-05-08",3.4,"Thanks to Matt for this bottle! De moi à moi pour mes 37 ans. Bière violente. Une phrase me revenait sans cesse à lesprit en dégustant cette bière extrêmement acide: dans ta face le vieux!. Un liquide presque blanc et sans mousse. Jaune et acide comme un jus de citron pressé. Les fruits souffrent de cette acidité citrique prétentieuse et démesurée. Non pas que ces derniers sont absents ou mal représentés ici, mais un liquide mieux balancé leur aurait donné un coup de pouce. Je sens bel et bien beaucoup de noyaux, mais jai surtout limpression de mordre dans du fruit à des années dêtre mûr. Très difficile à boire.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

3904,"2016-01-12",2.9,"Pours a hazy yellow with a small white head that leaves some lacing. Nose is of sulfur, fecal matter, oak and fruits. Not offputting to me but close. Taste is really citric and almost harshly acidic like most Bu versions weve had with some nice apricot flavors. Really too acidic to be remotely enjoyable and drinking a full bottle of this would mean a guaranteed heartburn. Light bodied with a moderate carbonation. Just too extreme but there were still a few qualities
to it (apricots).","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

3904,"2016-01-10",3.1,"Bottle (750 ml) at tasting. From kcherney, thanks! Hazy brighy yellow with a smal white head, some retention, leaving little lacing. Aroma is dominated by sulfur unfortunately along citric/apricots notes and mild herbalness. Taste is super citric and acidic with apricot, herbal notes, mild spiciness (coriander mostly) and oaky notes. Light body, in ""watery"" territory. Lively carbonation. Dry and puckering finish. This is a shame that this beer is in the top-50 Sour/Wild Ale as this is very hard too drink, unbalanced and puckering. Another overrate alert for De Garde here.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3904,"2016-01-09",3.2,"750ML Bottle split a few ways with the QC crew. Thanks Tom1 for sharing!

A - Very faded light yellow with a small 1 finger white had that fades fast. Looks nice but mostly like any other berliner pre-fruit from De Garde.

S - Metallic aroma with some sulphur, fecal matter, some cleaning fluid and grape acidity.

T - Juicy, very dry with some dry hopped northwest hop elements. Peach is most present but fades pretty quickly. The finish is sweet with a lot of fruit and lacto acidity

M - Insanely thin mouthfeel, goes down easy with a faint sweetness at the finish.

O - Another Bu I guess?","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

Bottle: The aroma consists of light peach, apricot, lemon, and a hint of must. It pours a slightly hazy dull golden-orange with a small white head that quickly fades to almost nothing short of a few stray bubbles. The flavor starts with a quick dose of citrus and peach. The finish has moderate-heavy sour apricots and lemons with a touch of yogurt. Its light bodied with moderate-lively carbonation.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
