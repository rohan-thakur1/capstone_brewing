4115,"2017-06-16",4.5,"Mead shared at homebrewcon 2017 by Ken Schramm - thanks!! Wonderful dark luscious red. Jammy blackberry nose. Decadent. Got to try two different versions, the commercial one fermented with 71B and another with RC-212, which was dryer and more tartness of the fruit showed. With 71B you can get both the fruit and the honey quite well.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
4115,"2017-05-29",4.3,"Bottle (375 ml), split 2-ways with the lady. 2nd birthday release. Deep purple-red leaving sticky legs on the glass. Aroma is intensely fruity and while I dont eat boysenberries often it does share many similarities with rapsberries, blackberries and loganberry as the descriptions states. The honey sweet is also felt in the aroma. Taste is, like is so often the case with Schramms, a nearly perfect mix of fruit acidity, honey sweetness and alcohol. The blackberry-like features are dominant but I also get some red raspberries notes and bluberries as well as vanilla notes. Medium body. Still. A bit tannic. Fruity finish with lingering honey sweetness and moderate alcohol wamrth. Decadent, yet so well balanced. The first 2-3 sips were blackberry juice alike but once it breathes a bit it reaches world-class level (or Schramms level). Another great fruited mead!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Flavor is like a raspberry, but with a different sort of tartness to it. Hard to describe. Huge fruit flavor, with subdued honey on the finish. Once again, very sweet but so well balanced. Love it.","","BrandNewBrew"
4115,"2016-10-27",4.3,"Batch 2 bottle shared by ygtbsm94 on 10/8/16, thanks Brad!Deep, burgundy-tinged cherry liquid is bright, clear and shows good viscosity.The nose is full of lusciously decadent fruit sugars, with strong, balancing acidity. Notes of blueberry, cherry, cranberry and vanilla all provide complexity, as it doesnt just smell of straight boysenberry. As with their other meads, the alcohol is well-concealed and the mead is clean. Definitely rich, but the acidity easily balances it and leaves it enjoyable.In the mouth, its equally well-balanced, of course sweet and decadent, but with a big, bright acidity boasting of fruit seed, tart juices and rich, concentrated sugars providing a honey-vanilla-like character. Tannin and acidity linger together on an ultra-soft, comforting palate. Little/no alcohol noted, certainly not what would be expected for its size. Impeccably clean and surprisingly drinkable.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The aroma just pulses with jammy fresh bowl of boysenberry and then getting into thin honey and booze notes. Wow! The taste delivers decedent, Im not worthy, yumminess from front to back. To midway a wafer thin layer of fruit skin tannin tartness peaks its ahead above the sea of rich smooth jammy fruity and honey sweetness. This just goes and goes and doesnt let up until you think you cant take it anymore but you dont want to. . . you cant stop. Wow!","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

4115,"2016-09-19",4.2,"1st birthday. Been lucky to have this shared with me twice. Look forward to trying batch 1 down the road. dark red wine color, purplish and opaque. Nose is dry and tannic, similar to red wine again--blackberry and light raspberry are present, but much more bitter than you usually find the fruit presence to be in the meads from this maker. It makes me think a little bit more than I usually do when I drink one of these awesome products. Flavor is similar to aroma, lots of balanced fruit and tannic bitterness. Like the best red wine I have ever tasted.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

4115,"2016-09-13",4.8,"From notes. This was shared at a tasting at Guss abode with several participants on September 10. 375 mL bottle of Madelines 1st birthday. This is a gem. The pour is a deep purple-red with no carbonation or head. Just very syrupy. The aroma is unbelievable. So much boysenberry. There is a sweetness about it and a little sharpness from the fruit. A light honey does round out the back end. The flavor is incredible as well. There is a big and dominating berry up front that fades a little toward the back end. The honey is sweet and a light syrup that poke in before a light booze offers itself. Its a little drier than Id like. The mouth feel is heavy and syrupy without any carbonation to interrupt it. There is a big berry and light honey combo on the aftertaste. Its really delicious. Fuck me.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

De couleur pourpre, doré au verre laissant un reflet finement rouge sur les rebords.
Arôme est généreux, puissant avec un bouquet frais et organique de miel mais un rétro finement suret de baies rouges. Le tout est rondement bien mené, complexe laissant augurer des effluves mêlant fine acidité fruité et côté plus sauvage du miel.
Palais est réchauffant, fruité de baies rouge, certaine épaisseur en bouche avec un profil laissant échapper une fine acidité, petite douceur terreuse de fraise, framboise, acidité de mûre et autres baies au nom qui mest souvent nouveau.

4115,"2015-11-27",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2016 Bottle courtesy of linusb. Rating 4000 if I add my backlog to my current total. A coincident but extremely happy a Schramms mead is my 4000th rating on this great site. Pours viscous deep bluish red leaving some prominent legs on the glass while dissipating. Smell is heavy fruity with honey, black raspberries, blackberries, butterscotch, moist soil, liquorice root, leather, minerals and alcohol. Taste is sweet, sour and heavy fruity. Mouthfeel is round, oily, sticky sweet, tart, tiny boozy and medium to full bodied. Finish is sweet and sour with honey, black raspberries, fleshy sweet blackberries, black currants, leather, moist soil and alcohol. This is good. Really good. But somehow Im still dissappointed. Tasty fruited mead but lacking in depth for a Schrammesque score. Sweet blackberry/raspberry jam with a very high acidity in the back. Im in no way a boysenberry expert and this might just be the case of a berry that doesnt suit me as well as raspberries, currants or cherries.Re-rate! 1st birthday. I experience this as much rounder and balanced than the first batch I tried. The honey sweetness and berry tartness and astringency seems more balanced.
