Bottle: The aroma has moderate-heavy pumpkin pie spices, light-moderate roast, faint chocolate, and coffee. It pours an orange tinted dark brown with a two finger tan had that fades to a minimal film outlined by a thick ring. The flavor starts with light-moderate chocolate and caramel.

66,"2016-09-30",4.0,"Pours a medium brown. Looks pretty clear but dark enough that you cant see through the glass. Head is relatively thin but it continues to build from the bottom. Aroma of cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin spice and pumpkin, as one might expect. The aroma doesnt have much coffee to it, but maybe there is some chocolate. It smells fricken delicious. The coffee comes through a lot more in the flavor. This beer does taste like a pumpkin latte. I usually wouldnt like a beer this sweet and with this much non-traditional beer flavor, but this actually works pretty well. For the amount of flavor, it is still pretty drinkable and clean in the mouth. Good effort on this one.

66,"2015-09-24",4.1,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a deep brown color with a one finger head of a cream colored foam. The head has a decent level of retention, fading over time to leave a lighter level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the brew is super strong of a cinnamon and nutmeg smell with a decent sum of roasted coffee and some roasted pumpkin. There is a tiny bit of a brown sugar and caramel as well, creating a rather roasty pumpkin pie smell overall.
 Taste  The taste begins with a rather roasty and lightly coffee tinted flavor. The pumpkin is very light upfront with it growing just slightly stronger as the taste advances. The spice however, which is also light upfront, increases to a greater extent than the pumpkin, giving a rather decently strong cinnamon and nutmeg taste to be on the tongue at the end of the taste. Along with the spice flavors comes some flavors of a roasted coffee taste, and with a little bit of caramel and brown sugar taste coming to the tongue at the end, one is left with a rather pleasantly spiced and lightly pumpkin-roasted flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is a little bit thinner for a darker pumpkin brew with a carbonation level that is average. A little thicker of a body may have been slightly nicer for the pumpkin and roasted flavors, but with that said, the lighter body was rather nice for the rich spice, so overall the feel was rather decent.
 Overall- While not as much coffee as I would have expected and with a rather strong showing of spice, it was still overall a very enjoyable and drinkable beer. I would certainly get this again. Another good pumpkin brew by Elysian.","","Darkmagus82"

Good nose of coffee, cinnamon, chai, burnt caramel. Taste is creamy coffee with slight pumpkin and pie spices, minor cherry fizz, pie crust. The effect is close to the name, a thin-bodied cappuccino with a small splash of pumpkin spice.
The slight bitterness that comes through is more akin to cappuccino than to the harsh grounds that afflict many coffee beers. Overall, if presented as a coffee beer, it would be very close to the top of that category.
What its not is an especially pumpkin beer, as that takes a definite backseat. Mixing it with The Great Pumpkin improves it.","","Pumpkin87"

66,"2014-11-30",4.0,"Pours an extremely dark brown, almost black. Head is 1/3 inch and khaki colored. Head retention is good and lacing is very good.

Smell is big on pumpkin and pumpkin spices, cinnamon and nutmeg dominate. Not really getting any coffee. Roasted caramel malt is also in the mix, alcohol and hops are not.

Taste is of standard pumpkin ale, lots of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Caramel malts add some roasted flavor, even getting some pie crust. Not getting much coffee, which is disappointing. Easy going down at 5% abv. 

Mouthfeel is light and somewhat thin. Head added a tiny bit of texture, beer was well carbonated. 

Overall this was a pretty good pumpkin beer. Not too sweet or overly spiced. Only wished coffee was more pronounced. I got almost no coffee which I think would have really set this beer apart. Regardless, it was worth trying, hoping theyll release this annually and up the dose of coffee","Colorado, USA","Angelmonster"

Aroma is as advertised big pumpkin and coffee notes mixing with each other rather than having either one overwhelming the other. Cinnamon and vanilla and chocolate also come through. Flavor is pumpkin cinnamon sweetness first then very quickly turning into roasted coffee flavors. The pumpkin and other spices tone down the coffee bitterness so that you get a sweet pumpkin aftertaste along with a distinct spice character. Mouthfeel is unremarkable. This is one of the few beers to pull off both pumpkin and dark roasted flavors and have both elements come through big time. Well done.","New York, USA","SG111"
66,"2014-10-04",4.3,"It looks like someone tried to rub off the date at the bottom of the bottle but I think it said: ""08/29/14."" Not sure how long Elysian has been doing this but Im glad I noticed it.
This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance had a dark brown complexion, close to black color. A thin off white foamy head had a decent retention that dissipated at a nice pace. Light stringy lacing clung nicely around the glass.
The smell was a pure strong coffee/slightly leaning towards the cappuccino sweet side of a light cinnamon, and then allspice and then nutmeg.
The taste took those flavors to town to enliven and thoroughly sweeten yet allow a slight roast of coffee to enter nicely.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a pure sticky sweet pumpkin/ginger spicy aftertaste and then a good watery sticky sweet pumpkin coffee finish. I say this was a sipper for the most part.
Overall, I say this was a very nicely done pumpkin ale with a ton of other things going on to ensure that Elysian is pretty much the King of Pumpkin ales. Of course I would have this again!","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
