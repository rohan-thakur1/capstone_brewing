Not an everyday beer but rather an intense experience like no other.  Thats one filthy sleazy gross beer.

2675,"2006-08-11",3.2,"2003 release: Cloudy brick red. Inordinately large bubbles comprise the unattractive head. Unappealing aroma of sharp alcohol, plasticy phenols, cedar, and wet paper. Well-aged cakey malt notes hide beneath. Fierce carbonation and mild tannins suck the palate dry. Beefy, thickset malts and a baked caramel sweetness attempt to allay the sharply alcoholic dryness, but the alcohol prevails. Highly disharmonious mixture of dried leather, plasticy phenols, and medicine do nothing but taint the overall flavor. Finishes earthily bitter and dully hoppy, with a profusion of ensuing phenolic belches. Very odd that they would opt to serve this as its extremely rigid, flavorwise. And the oxidation has rendered the aroma mostly papery and dull. Dang.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Maple, vanilla, oak mustiness, mild alcohol, smoke and just a touch of hops are all present. The body is med. but with that creamy texture that only comes from a few select breweries (3Fs and Alesmith come to mind). The flavors are equally as complex. The peat malt makes an appearance but never outshines the fruitcake, sherry and vanilla. The finish is lightly dry and becomes more and more warming as the beer sits.

Not exactly in a way that I like, however.  Unsettled tasting, young, woody liquor that seems to burn the tongue or at least numb it.  Harsh as anything Ive had, like liking the inside of an oak barrel.  Belgian-like yeast is noted, but definitly muted in my opinion... this is one beer that got carried away with the oak.

2675,"2004-10-08",4.5,"Bloody spectacular. I have been getting threating phone calls to rate this so that it has the necessary number to be official....so here goes: Went for a road trip to Mont Royal for the 6th Anniversary Party. This was first up out of fear it would be gone if we waited.  Sitting as I was with the sun streaming in caused me to make a choice - either wear my shades in the bar (too cool) or use the glass of beer to block the sun. Clearly the right choice, for revealed to me was a beautiful rich reddish brown liquid that looked like the perfect colour to paint your apartment - or in this case tongue - with. Glorious aromas of hops and caramel and my favourite Canadian flavour. Maple, leeched from the Oak barrels which housed this nectar, infused this glorious candy-ish barleywine.- making it a decadent indulgance. What's that?....it isn't officially a Barleywine?...wow. Toffee and caramel and more maple and hops and where the hell was the alcohol. A beatiful introduction to an outstanding brew pub....at this point I could hardly envision there might be anything better still to come.","Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA","beerhugger"
2675,"2004-09-15",4.6,"Wow.  What a great start to the Dieu du Ciel 6th Anniversary party.  Cask conditioned.  Aged 1.5 years in a oak barrel that had been used for a maple liqueur.  Dark amber in colour with a large off white head.  The aroma was fantastic, lots of maple, hops, toffee and quite sweet.  The flavour was of caramel, toffee, plums, hops, maple.  Beautifully balanced, large body with no sign of alcohol.  Finishes very smooth and creamy and long.  As other people have noted this is definitely top 50 material.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","radiomgb"
2675,"2004-09-13",4.2,"One year of age, cask. Dark amber muddy body topped with a huge bubbly light brown head. Aroma is simply amazing: it hides the alcohol surprisingly well, and it carries various hints of caramel, toffee, fruits and brown sugar. Mouthfeel is almost liquorous, and is characterised by wonderful port flavors and a long, warm final. The whole thing is perfectly stable and balanced. That great potion undoubtedly deserves  to stand among the top-50.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
2675,"2004-09-13",4.3,"Cask conditioned, served at Dieu du Ciels 6th anniversary bash. Cloudy, dark amber color with a thin bubbly head. Inviting aroma of caramel and alcohol, maybe malt. Amazing flavor of butterscotch, spices, alcohol. Medium to full body, heavenly mouthfeel related to the cask conditioning, soft carbonation. Amazing, excellent, I want more !!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"

This is a heavily muddy beer. Color ranges from Orange to  brown (depending on light).

It seems that the year of aging has had a good influence on this beer: the alcohol is still heavy but it is now much more  covered by the delicious port taste.","Quebec, CANADA","PrimeMinister"
2675,"2003-10-01",4.1,"(Draught) Quick dissipating head and a deep mahogany body. Noze of fruit, bourbon and molasses. Beautiful! Couplex mix of strong whiskey, a handful of oranges and berries. Outstanding!","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
2675,"2003-09-21",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 14, 2004 One year old. On the handpump. Aged in an oak barrel that had previously been used to ferment a maple liqueur. Utter decadence. Sour, dark fruit. Hops are quite pronounced. Caramel, toffee, sweetness. What a complex and delightful bouquet. Caramel-copper coloured with a decent, frothy, off-white head that recedes slowly to a nice cover. Falvours include raisins, plums, dates, caramel, toffee. Sweet and perfumey and suffused with maple throughout. Smooth, creamy mouth. Alcohol rarely apparent and at 10.5% this had me feeling happy pretty quickly! (8-4-10-5-19=4.6)

Big malty aroma with mild hops apparent also. Beautifil dark amber with a finger of head. Lacing like the rings on a tree showing each sip. Somewhat sweet with big malt flavour as promised by the nose with berry, wood, peat-smoke and said sweetness all battling for the palate's attention. High alcohol apparent only in the finish. Good full mouthfeel - this beer begs you to continue drinking and it's hard to say no... On tap. (8-5-9-4-17=4.3)","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
2675,"2003-09-19",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2004 Light brown with red and grey? tones. The little head that there is doesn't stay for long. Basically no carbonation. Aroma of caramel, malt, cinammon, hops. Sweet, balanced and complex in mouth: very malty, spicy, peppery, hop notes, but never bitter. Outstandingly well-hidden 10.5%alcohol. A treat, easy to drink pure artwork..  On cask at 6th anniversary , Has a nice frothy head this time, mostly white. Body is deep, mysterious orangey-brown. Lots of malt complexities in the aroma with vibrant cookie-like flavors and dry hopping notes (mildest grassy and earthy orange). Penetrating woodiness, spicy pepper grains and herbal characteristics. Sweet coating aftertaste to die for reminiscent of smoked maple and single malt scotch. Silkysmooth mouthfeel, oily and possessing the most diplomatic carbonation. Plug this cask straight into my veins.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2675,"2003-09-18",4.2,"Reddish amber colour, thin head.  Aroma of smoky peppery malts, a hint of oak and a really nice hop freshness.  This hard to describe beer had a single malt chachter, somewhat peaty and smoky in the finish, wooden tones, vegetal notes, even a hint of saltiness.  Please brew this beer again!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","SimonPatrice"
2675,"2003-09-18",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2013 (Fresh, on tap): Parsimoniously, hop pepper vapors contemplate and join the voluptuous, sweet maple alcohol...Harmoniously, fluctuating leafy waves embrace the punctuating peated algae...Hop-dappled herb ripples effortlessly undulate over the rich toasted caramel...An exemplary, experimental marine life thrives within, striving to lead us all into a better world...
(Aged Cask): At this point in its maturing process, this marvel simply begs you to sit down and emit orgasmic noises every sip or so...After a year or so in this cask, the flavors have blended into a unique paragon of creativity and nourishment and has reached, to my tastes, world-class levels...You would not even dream its over 10%...

(2-year-old bottle, aged at the brewery): Like most of their bottles, carbonation is stronger than the initial version...So many flavors here, all described above, still thrive in joyous, frenzied, bacchanalia...Alcohol is still present, but the malt sweetness and complexity is so appealing that the heat blends superbly with it...There is nothing else like this out there...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
