2126,"2012-05-05",4.0,"(Bottle) Crystal clear, light gold. Pours thick, white head, diminishing, but lasting. Mid-light carbonation. Aroma - Intense, spicy, american hops;
grapefruit and a fairly strong tropical aroma; lychees! (yum!), and a sweet, bready/biscuity malt: Nice, balanced, sweet and fruity aroma, fairly strong.
A pretty creamy body for this strength, quite oily too, bit of light carb on the tongue and lips. Good tropical and spicy hop flavours, sweet malt, with a slightly dry, refreshing finish. Nice balance, though just a tad sweet (but pleasant). Very drinkable, without compromising on flavour - Crouch Vale seem to be pretty good at this with their golden ales and bitters.","Essex, ENGLAND","essexcalf"

2126,"2012-02-06",3.8,"Bottle at home. Actually got this Christmas Eve as a present but have only just got around to opening it. It pours a wonderful light amber with golden edges and a billowing cloud of an off-white head caused by the big clump of least from the bottle conditioning. This stays like a fluffy crouton down the whole glass creating some wonderful lacing.  I let the yeast slip into the glass by accident and it went straight to the bottom without spoiling the clarity of the beer. Theres a rush of grapefruit, grapefruit peel and lime in the aroma but also the faintest whisper of yeast. A gorgeous but subtle wave of light grapefruit and lime then washes across the tongue tingling the tastebuds everso slightly. This leaves a dry sweetness without much bitterness and disappears gradually and sofly. A light and refreshing Golden Ale.","Essex, ENGLAND","justm"
