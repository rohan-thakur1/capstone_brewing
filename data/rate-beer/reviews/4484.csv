4484,"2016-11-24",3.4,"750ml bottle - thanks martjoobolut!
Extra thanks Mart - this brings me to 10 of every style, and youve been about a third of the hardest to find ones - thanks again! Rich sweet bananaey aroma, but some banana string harshness too. Toffee rich in the taste, and some more banana. Not saying 10.3% in taste and feel, but there is a heat in the gullet a few seconds after swallowing. Finish is back to banana strings. Ingredients on bottle said gerstenmalz, but this has to be heavily wheat, Id put money on it. Rather decent, Ill take a top-up thank you... and another...","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
