Smell is fruity and funky with crackers, lemon juice, peaches, dried apricots, hay, dri soil, leather, barnyard, whipped cream and lemon zest. Taste is sour, tiny bitter, fruity and funky. Mouthfeel is dry, tart and medium bodied. Finish is slightly sour with crackers, white bread, lemon juice, peaches, pineapple, star fruit, hay, dry soil, minerals, barnyard, lemon zest and hints of whipped cream. Amazing funky sour saison.

2872,"2015-02-10",3.9,"Bottle... Pours hazy and peach-colored with a small, brief, white head. The aroma is fruity and bright, featuring stone fruits and citric acid. Medium to full-bodied with vibrant carbonation. The flavor is bright, crisp, moderately sour and silly refreshing - as a saison should be. Fruity, super-tart finish. Look up ""bright"" in the dictionary and youll find a photograph of this beer. A saison should be more refreshing than complex, although it may require a complex process to create a refreshing saison.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

2872,"2014-11-29",3.6,"Pour is a pale golden amber with a thinner tight white head that lingers for a moment. Nose is strong grape, lots of skin to it, light oak, moderate vanilla, hints of apricot and a faint dusty brett. Taste is sweet, lots of white grapes, grape skins, golden fruits. Light oak to it, very little farmhouse aspect. Dustiness is extremely faint. Light sourness in finish, good feel, soft delicate, a hint syrupy, well carbonated.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"
2872,"2014-11-26",4.7,"Four bottles and one draft pour throughout the last few months. Aroma is funky fruit skins like peach, white grape and melon, acidic pineapple, white wine, dough, grain, signature Sante eggy/yogurty funk, vanilla, musty oak. Phew  this really has it all. The beer pours uniform hazy orange, with nice 1-finger thick white foam that hangs out for a bit. Taste is a blend of tropical stone fruits, tropical brett character, lactic, lemon tart, vanilla, mineral water, oak, fruit skins, orange peels, and moderate malt sweetness with a light sour quality. Body is medium-thick, chewy, with medium-high carbonation and finishes very dry with light tartness; probably the driest out of all the bottled saison offerings. After taste of tropical fruit, tart lemon, rustic grain, light bitterness. Overall,this beer has everything from fruit, funk, acid, buggy yeast, barrel influence and rustic grain quality. My only knock of the beer is that it is perhaps a tad too dry, but thats hyper-nitpicking. I dont see how this can age any better. Help  my Sante homerism has reach a new high.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
2872,"2014-11-10",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 11, 2014 Bottle thanks to Chow. Pours a cloudy orange with small white head. The aroma is strong funk, oak, lacto, lemon zest. Thin mouthfeel with nice lacto, oak, tart, lemon, lingering tartness, wow really enjoyed this.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
2872,"2014-10-21",4.1,"75cl bottle shared. Light gold/amber. Big peach nose, lovely strawberry character, some lighter citric notes, light funk. Taste is juicy as you like, great apricot, melon, light lime, strawberry, little funk in there. So bloody well integrated. Light in body. Incredibly nuanced. Citrus and warmer fruit tones integrate perfectly with the light funk. Crisp. Wonderful.","London, ENGLAND","Beermack"
2872,"2014-10-16",4.3,"The beer is medium yellow, glowy gold. Smallish white head. Somewhat cloudy, though I got some lees in my glass. Funky and fruity. Bright with light lemons. Some oak. Very nice mix of saison flavors bouncing around. Apricots, peaches, grapes. Good stuff. Lightly tart taste. Lemons, stone fruit, earth, bright grain, mild oak. Light lactic sourness. Mild citrus bitterness. Light mouthfeel but full on the palate. Nice mineral character. Excellent saison.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

2872,"2014-10-12",4.5,"Aroma is rather fruity with a nice, light, bright citrus character with quite a bit of overripe stone fruit. Lots of white wine and oak character as well. Light acidity. 
Pours a cloudy golden orange with a moderately sized, thick, white head that slowly recedes to the edges. Moderate lacing and faint legs. 
Flavor is fairly acidic with a nice citrus character of lemon and orange. Medium light stone fruit notes with hints of tropical fruit. Medium bitterness with some soft water character. Light oak notes and grape tannins. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a really delicious barrel aged saison. This beer is all about balance - nice acidity, nice water quality, nice barrel notes, nice esters.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
2872,"2014-10-02",4.3,"750 ml bottle poured into the trusty Duvel tulip. Great lemony-gold color with a wispy white head. Candied orange dominates the aroma, which also sees seabreeze, straw mulch, and plain yogurt waft through. Flavor is just so good. Meyer lemon, greek yogurt, egg yolk, mimosa. Feels soft and fruity at first but the acidity aggregates into quite a bite once your glass is dwindling. Mouthfeel is a little off for Sante, a bit sticky and bubbly, but its a minor detail. This is another world class saison in a lineup full of them.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
2872,"2014-10-02",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2014 750ml bottle - thanks to Colin for sharing... Pours a hazy golden straw hue, consistent throughout, and topped with a creamy soapy white head... Crisp botanical with lactic sourness. Very soft and subtle grain backing with a touch of musk... Flavors are more of the same with a lactic lemony tartness. Not sharp but has softened edges, perhaps a touch flabby. Clean tasting with a moderate degree of sourness but not acidic in any way. Lighter than medium bodied with a softer level of carbonation. More. Botanical floralness comes through more after warming. Really nice.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
2872,"2014-09-21",3.6,"750ml bottle. The aroma has barnyard, peach, and slight vinegar. Fairly tart flavor, somewhat acetic and lactic. Slight oak, tart light fruit, and a touch of diacetyl on the finish. Biting acidity, fairly carbonated and lively. Pretty tasty.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
2872,"2014-09-16",4.2,"Ah the joys of being a Sara's Cellar member! A - pours is a hazy dark golden rod with 1 finger of white head that dissipates quickly. S - such a Sante saison nose. House bugs, white wine and musty barrel notes, citrus fruity character is strong. Lemon zest , earthy floral notes and a light acetic tinge. The nose has quite a sharp edge. M - sour and a little dry. Full thick body, almost chewy. Nice complex palate. Dry bitter end with an acetic tinge. T - reminiscent of so many Sante beers (cask 200, Bernice, Nona) but richer/denser, sweeter. Sante bugs and yeast up front, white wine musty barrel character. Palate is sweeter/maltier than a typical Sante saison. Strong citrus (orange/grapefruit) with canned pineapple with a dusty Brett character on the palate. End is lemony, dried grasses and acetic notes. O - this is another nice ba saison from the Sante gang. A nice balance of sweet/sour/musty/barrel/yeasty goodness. A tad maltier than their best, but still really a great beer.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
