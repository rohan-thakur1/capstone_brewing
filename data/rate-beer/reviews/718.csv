Pours with a large, billowing head that is faintly tan (or taupe? I always get those mixed up - taupe sounds more geeky though so lets go with that), leaving some thick, chunky lacing behind as it recedes to a murky rust-copper body. Aroma is very sweet, redolent of bubblegum and fruity berries, a bit mushy and perhaps slightly oxidized at this point...a terrific soft mouthfeel with light prickliness, the body is quite sweet on the front but becomes tart, oxidized and sour towards the finish, which is burnt coffee and strikes me (or struck me) as rather odd.

The smell had some citrus, rye, malty mutedness with just a tad bit of hops in the background.

One good thing that has happened during this time is that the price has gone down on average of about 2 bucks per 6 pk. I got this 6 on sale for $9.49 at jewel by my house. Pours red/brown with no foam. I did some research about the bible story to see if it would help me enjoy the beer but it just left me confused. So the bonus points I usually give for over 7% alcohol content were taken back because of said confusion. I will continue to drink this beer especially if the price continues to go down.","Illinois, USA","TattooJack"

S: You can smell hops, malt and a hint of sugar 
T: wow, this is quite a combination! This beer kicks you right in the taste buds in a way I was not expecting when I first tried this at the brewery. Even though its not exactly the highest IBU IPA in the world, it certainly is a bitter one; the combination of the hops they used to pair with the rye certainly makes a strong combination. The finish is extremely long lasting and the bitter hop flavor stays for a long time. 
O: When I first tried this at the brewery I was blown away, it was so aggressive and intense. I quickly fell in love with it and walked over to the counter and bought one of their Cane and Ebel T-shirts right away. Ive introduced this beer to a few beer drinkers and non-beer drinkers alike and there are always mixed reactions, but either way once you have this beer youll remember it.

718,"2013-10-05",4.1,"Had on-tap at Kumas Corner in Chicago for $6 a pint.

I have to be honest, I didnt even really notice that this was a rye beer. It had a minor rye quality now that I think back on it, but this drank like a Red IPA to me. I did have a Dreadnaught before having this one, so that could have very well shat on my tastebuds while tasting this brew. Cane & Ebel has a pretty deep brown red color... a completely different shade from other ryes Ive had. Theres a nice two finger, slightly tan colored head. I guess the POPULAR adjective is KHAKI. Ill go with that. Lacing is awesome... pretty much there from beginning to end.

In the aroma and taste, I just get quite a lot of hops, and almost only hops -- not that I mind at all, its just what made me think this was a Red IPA. The aftertaste is bitter, and gives a fairly malty and slightly rye flavor to make me start to understand the beer a little bit more.

Excellent beer, for sure. I said it three or four times already, but this screams ""Style: Red IPA"" until the beer is basically down your throat. I tend to find that rye beers that are really heavy on the rye almost present a vomit sort of flavor (appealing, right?), so I welcome the burst of hops that I get from this beer. Id VERY happily revisit this beer.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"
718,"2013-10-03",4.1,"Pours a chocolately brown with a slightly off white head. Leaves good lacing down the glass.

The spicy smell of the rye comes through along with some biscuity notes and floral hops.

The taste starts out with a little caramel sweetness along fading into a bitter aftertaste with a strong rye presence throughout.

Mouthfeel is medium with solid carbonation level.

It certainly isnt sugary but it is fairly sweet, maybe a bit like a dopplebock but with hops to round out the flavor and not make it incredibly over sweet. The flavor hits in the back of my mouth and sticks with the hops hitting the tip of my tongue. Interesting and good.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"

718,"2012-10-09",3.4,"12 oz. bottle served in a FFF anniversary pint glass. Best by 2/20/2012 on the bottle.

A: Pours a deep amber, almost cherrywood like color with lighter amber edges. A two finger, off white head forms on the pour and leaves some nice sticky webbings of lace. 

S: Nice floral hops, some rye spice, little bit of citrus zest, and some honey-like sweetness that I can only assume is the palm sugar.

T: The palm sugar gives this an odd sweetness upfront that doesnt seem to really blend mesh with the rest of the drink. It is nice though with some rye spice, a little bit of fruitiness, mainly apples and pears, and some nice sweet floral hops.

M: This is what kills it for me. I dont know if it was just my bottle, but it had some below average cabonation and it really turned into a sticky mess. I was expecting some stickiness with the style, but the lack of carbonation almost turned into a syrup. The body was full flavored though.

O:If the body had more carbonation I would have really enjoyed this, but it really knocked it down a couple pegs. I will revisit in the future and hopefully it was just my bottle. The flavors were nice though and it was probably the best tasting offering from Two Brothers.

718,"2012-09-28",4.5,"This is one of my favorite ""go to"" beers. I generally like rye beers, but this one is special due to the addition of the Thai Palm sugar. It pours a clear deep ruby color with a nice one and a half finger tan foamy head. The creamy foam head recedes slowly and leaves nice sticky lacing. The aroma is rye and sweet malts, with some good citrus and pine Simcoe hops beneath. The flavor is hoppy up front, with that great earthy and woody pine and citrus from the Simcoe, then it mellows out fast with a semi-dry and sweet malty finish. The Thai Palm sugar gives an almost Belgian Dark Ale flavor, but without the usual Belgian yeasts. This is a super easy drinking beer with a ton of flavor. Another winner from Two Brothers Brewing!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","SSmith2012"

718,"2012-03-01",3.8,"From notes.  First reviewed 2/5/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

Out of the bottle this pours a mostly transparent cherry red color with a nice off-white froth. Decent retention and some nice lace forms scattered webs on the glass.

A very blended aroma with caramel, spicy rye, tropical fruit hoppiness, and some candied grapefruit. This could be considered a DIPA. 

The flavor starts out with a bit of gooey caramel, then candied grapefruit, pineapple, and tangerine effortlessly combine with a spicy rye flavor to give this beer great depth. A touch of spicy pine at the end, just to kick it up a notch. Finishes clean. There is Thai palm sugar in here, although I am not sure how it manifests itself.

The smoothness in Cane & Ebel is not interrupted by the rye. As opposed to a complete complement, the dryness just softens how juicy I would otherwise imagine this being. Medium carbonation and a medium to full body.

A solid beer overall, and one whose scores I keep upwardly revising as the glass progresses. It starts smooth and I do not pick up on all of the flavors, but as I am able to drink more and dissect the flavors I like it even better.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

3.5 A: Two Brothers sure has an interesting take on the color red. This is purplish black. One finger of frothy beige head. Retention is lacking, but a short ring of lacing is left.

4.0 S: This has a hell of a lot more hop character than rye, but in any case it smells great. Citrusy and floral hops. Just a touch of spicy earthy rye underneath. Toasty malts with minor caramel notes.

2.5 T: The taste is confused. Moderate, though out of place, hop bitterness that comes off in an almost burnt nature. Rye is much more apparent, but it doesnt work well with the hops. That isnt to say it cant. Ive had rye IPAs that were delicious. A touch of roastiness, toast, and sugary caramel. 

3.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Reasonably creamy, but lacking smoothness due to the perceived burnt flavors.

2.5 D: I think this would have worked better if they used less bittering hops. In any case, its at least interesting.

Overall: What an onslaught this beer is on my taste buds, yet still quite refreshing.

This is now my third Rye IPA/Red Ale (Founders Red Rye and Summit India Rye being the other two), and this is simply a sub-style I truly enjoy. Like the Black IPA (or whatever we are now calling it), this almost deserves its own style now, since this has nothing in common with the other, tamer Rye beers out there.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

718,"2011-06-22",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 15, 2011 Mellow but strong in equal measure, Cane & Abel is a showcase of brewing skill, melding jaw breaking strength with a balanced profile that belies that strength and settles into a balanced easy drinker.  
Pours a light crystal clear brown with ample sticky lacing, this brew starts with a malty caramel aroma that buoys a significant piney hop aroma. The first sip is surprising as the aggressive hop content does not attack the tastebuds with prickly abandon, instead choosing to lay in wait, allowing the smooth body to mellow into a melange of malt sugars then gradually creep back lending a long resiny aspect to the flavorful finish. Skirting the territory of the barley wine, Cane & Abel deftly avoids that moniker choosing instead a strong but flavorful profile that hides its muscles in a classy and complex veil of flavors.

718,"2010-11-28",3.9,"I have tried about a dozen Two Brothers beers at this point and my first impression of this is that it is far and away the best of the lot so far. Its basically an IPA, though its chestnut hue is perhaps a shade or two too dark for the style. The head is small and white but it leaves lace in dramatic stripes. The aroma is a definite highlight. It is deep and piny but retains a brightness and vibrancy to the hop character. It is a lovely example of just what simcoe dry hopping can add to a beer. The taste follows along the same lines, w/ an earthy bitterness well matched by a very slight sweetness. This is a big beer but its nice and drinkable though a combination of light body and somewhat lower carbonation create a very slight impression of wateriness, which is my only--and a very minor--complaint. I am very glad that this beer is made in my neck of the woods.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
718,"2010-11-26",3.7,"Appearance: burnt browns with amber sap along the bottom. Tannish head floats above gentle suspended chunks of brewy goodness. Thin blanket which puffs up with some swirling while lace scatters.

Nose: rye seeds atop rye seed stuffed rolls fresh and warm from the oven. Palm frond atop palm trees. Palm sugar crunchies underneath along with melba. Sliced apples and sliced pears; insides juicy sweet while skins are crisp and bitter.

Palate: full bodied and slightly sticky. Melba toast offers a solid platform along with green grass blades and palm fronds. Bready in the back with chewy rye rolls. Apple sweetness follows the rye rolls while their bitter skins linger. Lips are sticky with a sugary essence of palm sap. Sweet on top and dry underneath from first quaff to last. Rye spice lingers in the breath. Bitterness of apple and pear skins makes for a thirst quenching and inducing paradox of quaffing enjoyment.

Final Thoughts: an interesting combination of ingredients which worked wonderfully well. I always enjoy rye in my beers, but the palm sugar was a new experience.

S-Nose is mild to moderate in strength with a citrusy hop character coming through the most...beneath this is rye and caramel malt.

T- Overall flavor, much like the nose, is mild to moderate in strength- but very good. Upfront is a balance of citrus flavor and rye bitterness. The finish gets a bit sweeter as hop juices, sugar, and bready yeast. A mild residual bitterness lingers on the far back of the palate as a mild sweetness lingers in the front.

P- Excellent. Mild to moderate carbonation with a medium weight very smooth, oily body.

O- This beer is great! My favorite rye so far. I am trying to take my time with it but find it disappearing fast. It has an excellent balance of sweet and bitter and superb mouthfeel. Id drink this all the time if I lived where it was available. Would love to have this one again sometime.

Thanks to someone for bonusing this fabulous beer.  Ive seen Two Brothers around but never picked anything up.  That may change - they certainly have at least one solid release.

Aroma / Appearance - The ruby red body possessed a chunky layer of head that was slightly off white.  Caramel, rye, sweet malt, and warm cherry pie form a bright combination of aromas that perk up the senses.

Flavor / Palate - Sweet caramel chews are the first impression.  Soon after comes rye and peanut butter cookies.  A residual maltiness highlights a smooth and cohesive mixture of flavors in a way that is so inviting I could almost finish three of these in a night.  The finish reminds me of warm angels food cake with a drizzle of cherry and caramel icing.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Pours a beautiful dark, but crystal clear, red color with a big creamy frothy off-white head that leaves some nice lace -- though it did take quite a high and aggressive pour to stir up the head. The aroma is richy and full of malty goodness. A warm breadyness, christmas cake, not much hops, some cherries. Flavor is good, though less robust and full.  There is more of a hop presence, but it is all hop bitterness, which is alright, but simply throws the beer off balance without any hop flavor.  Still enjoyable. Creamy with minimal carbonation and a medium body.  Overall: great look, feel, and aroma, which lead the flavor to be a bit of a disappointment.  Good beer on the whole though.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

718,"2009-06-07",3.3,"12oz bottle from justn on BA - thanks. Russet pour, with very distinctive look to the carbonation: very few bubbles, but very large ones. The initial aroma suggests a malt profile similar to Arrogant Bastard, but the soft sugar comes through fairly quickly. Mouthfeel is average and theres far less hop aggression than the Bastard hint would indicate, which I think suits the sugar addition nicely. But whether its the Simcoe dry-hopping or something else, theres an odd tea-like finish to this that seriously detracts from the overall rating. Not bad, but a bit weird in the less than happy way.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Cast in a dark, plummy hue, transparent, when held to the light, but otherwise significantly hazy. A plump and stable serving of creamy froth sits atop. 

Big, wicked sweetness jumps out from the start. Rye + Sugar = guess what? Deeply, darkly fruity, very similar to a barleywine. Cherries dunked in brandy. 

Sleek and supple once on the palate, fairly thick and clinging. Fills the mouth and spreads this tasty blend of grain, fruit, and a dry sweetness. Terribly unique. 

Despite it’s initial girth, Cane and Ebel finds itself a sophisticated, yet relaxing ale, with many mysteries inside.

The aroma is interesting and shows notes of piney and grassy hops to go with the palm. Caramel malt and vanilla make up the background. The flavor follows suit with the piney resinous hops up front with a little citrus fruit in ther as well. The hops are quickly overmatched by the big rye and caramel malt backbone that adds a good amount of sweetness. This one is medium bodied with good carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel from the vanilla. This one was easy to drink and went down smooth with a slight bitter finish.

Small to moderate amount of long-lasting beige head. Extensive, long-lasting, sticky lacing. Light, accessible flavors. Fruity and floral. Brown sugar, plum, and watermelon tastes. Not as spicy as I would have expected from a rye beer, but there is some pepper. Dry hops taste, especially in the finish. Pleasant but not great flavor.

I was presented with a deep red-brown beer with a thick tan headed to brown head.  The lacing was magnificent.  Aroma was a special sort of orchard sweet that could be smelled across the table.  Flavor was more of the beautiful fruitiness and a cut of rich, mellow bakery-like goodness.  As one would hope with something from the cask, this was creamy and luscious all over the mouth.  It was almost a shame to swallow it!  Overall, Im a little afraid to try the bottle version because I have to expect that itll be a letdown.  On the cask, for sure, however: marvelous!

718,"2008-03-05",3.8,"Fresh Spring 2008 bottle.  Wow, this one is loaded with resinous pine hops!  The pour is a slightly hazy crimson red, with a minimal off-white head.  Minimal spotty lacing is noted.  The aroma shows massive, resinous pine and spruce hops.  Caramel malts comprise the background, though they are ultimately dominated by the evergreen elements.  Vanilla and oak complete the nose, which is somewhat intimidating, yet simultaneously inviting.  Flavors are a touch more subdued, yet still substantially hoppy.  Pine and spruce are joined by grapefruit, which takes a bit of the resinous edge off and replaces it with sharp citrus.  Caramel malts reminiscent of an imperial amber ale balance things out a bit, with vanilla showing strong on the finish.  Slightly boozy, as it is, this one goes down pretty smooth.  Very nice, if youre into massively hoppy, resinous brews.  I enjoyed this one quite a bit, and Im thrilled to have learned that theres an imperial version!","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Distinct rye spiciness with a ton of high alpha going on, which is what I find often with two brothers, the perhaps slight overuse of bittering hops.

I dont really like ""strong ales"" but this one is an example to be followed! Pours a deep, deep amber, almost orange. Slight foam and a trace of lacing. Flavor is awesome; molasses, burnt fruit, and a candy finish. Hints of toffee, hops, and cream just add to the flavor. Doesnt get too sticky, which is a huge plus.

clear dark red, whispy beige head, 
sweet malt aroma with nice fresh hops, a nice swirl creates a huge creamy head causing an explosion of hop aroma and leaves some nice lace in its wake, 
body starts off a bit thin but turns creamy, 
lots of hop flavor from the begining through to a long bitter finish, nice sweetness to keep it balanced

hazy dark red, fine beige head, streaks of drippy lace, 
body is decent from the beginning, 
lots of bitter dark caramel flavor, biscuit malts offer a bready character but are kept very dry by the earthy bitterness, a bit of sweet citrus is the only sweetness to be found,

Very hot on the tongue, like a kind of reduced candy sugar and cayenne soup.  Baked peaches and bourbon intimations in a simmering alcoholic pool.  A green, sprucy bitterness dances tangentially over the hot surface.  Rye is submerged.  Palate has strength but lacks depth.

This ale poured a dark brownish amber color with a thick, rocky, beige head that slowly subsided, leaving some extra thick, sticky lacing around the glass.  The aroma was very strong and consisted of a huge floral, citrus hop presence, along with some caramel malt sneaking in behind the hops.  The flavor was decently hoppy and bitter, but the citrus elements appeared to have been mellowed out quite a bit by the palm sugar.  This seemed to give the beer some brandy and vanilla characteristics.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with a slightly slick, oily feel, along with light carbonation.

Cane and Ebel poured an absolutely crystal clear copper. 1 finger creamy white head formed on the pour that left sheet lacing as it slowly receded. Minimal small slow rising carbonation is present.

The smell is of a solid backbone of caramel with layer upon layer of hoppiness on top. Pine tar and oily resinous hops are showcased in this beer. There is also a unique but mild sugary sweetness from the palm sugar. The sweetness really goes nicely with the resinous hop aroma.

Caramel maltiness comes through up front quickly followed by the resinous hops. The resinous hops linger and get joined by a mild leather flavor thats also from the hops. The caramel maltiness turns into more of a raw graininess as this beer develops on the palate. Finishes with a lingering resinous hops and mild aspirin.

Medium bodied with minimal carbonation lets the beer work its way through at its own pace. Moderately dry finish. Solid hop bitterness leaves the tongue numb which is something I always enjoy.

Im going to polish off this 22 and if I had another bottle I would drink it too. The hops make my mouth water and the dryness makes me want another drink.

Another exciting beer from Two Brothers. Ive been looking for this for awhile and finally found it. Glad I did. A really enjoyable hoppy rye beer.

718,"2007-05-22",3.3,"This h opped up rye ale is dry, is hoppy, is good.  It does not have a great body, but as the beer warms it does start to gain a caramelly vanilla flavor.  Probably due to the sugar and malt.  The rye adds a certain additional spiciness that accentuates the bitter, citric hops.  Overall, this beer is not very complex due to the dominance of hops versus the very thin body.  Id expect this out of an IPA, but a I expect more out of a red ale.","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"

718,"2007-05-15",3.8,"Clear dark-amber body topped by a short-lived beige head leaving good lacings.  Roasted rye bread and tree barks soaked in citrus/lemon juice.  Well hopped and the resulting hop flavour is pleasantly unfocussed.  Bitterness is of medium intensity.  The gentle malt sweetness feels 2/3 caramel and 1/3 maple.  Some dried fruits.  A little dryness combined with a medium tartness really increases drinkability, after a 660ml I wanted more.  Very good beer.  As far as 7% hopped-rye beers are concerned I prefer the Founders Red Rye but these are two different beasts.  If anything Id label the Cane and Ebel as a Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye Light.  Similar flavour spectrum, just less intense.  I love well hopped rye beers.

It poured a sparkling red with only a little head that hung around a bit.  It has a rye-ish (like othe rye beers) and hoppy aroma, with some cedar notes that reminded me of some Hitachino I had a while back.  Flavor is dry-hoppy, hop-citrusy, with just a touch of sourness.

The aftertaste is more of the orange peel hops. Its fairly thin all the way through compared to the other big rye beers.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"

According to the label, Two Brothers Cane and Ebel is ""A Hopped-Up Red Rye Ale.""  I would say that it lives up to that description nicely!  It pours a nice clear amber color (""peach-copper-brown"" according to my wife) with a slight reddish hue.  Moderate amount of carbonation with a fluffy tan head.  It collapses kind of quickly, the the remaining crown provides ample lacing throughout the duration.  The aroma is of rye and sweet fruity (orange/citrus) hops and malt.  The flavor is much like the aroma, with a deep caramel maltiness and a substantial, but well-balanced citrus/pine hop bitterness.  The rye comes back out in the lengthy, slightly dry finish.  Llike most other rye beers, this one is slighty heavier than average on the palate smooth and creamy going down!  

-- I love rye beers and this is another fine example.  Overall I would place it as a close runner-up to Founders Reds Rye and Terrapin Rye2...  

22 oz bottle from Rivers Bend.  --

Grassy/resiny hop aromas.  Rye is light, but plays well with others (hops) as well as a hint of bready malt gets stronger as it warms.  Well balanced w/ a strong piney hop flavor.  A slight edge to bitterness in the semi dry finish.  Caramel and rye malts balance hop flavor well, but it is hop dominated throughout and lasts into the aftertaste.    Not a whole lot of fruitiness going on here, just lots of hops.  Medium carbonation, fuller medium body, smooth m/f, well hidden alcohol.

718,"2006-09-04",4.1,"Bomber carried out here by a friend from Boston.

Pours a deep caramelly brown, reddish-orange highlights with a nice tan head and decent lacing. The aroma though dominated by very nice, powerful resin-and-citrus hops, is quite sweet. A light confectionary sugar rests on top; underneath all of those hops there is some burnt sugar, more fruitiness, a faint hint of rye, notes of lime, and unfortunately on just a few sips I also pick up a whisper of a cough-syrup base. 

The flavor is a nice mix of dark caramel sugars and up-front citrus rind hops. Theres a bit of vanilla cream soda in here; rye notes add some spicy interest to the finish which works wonderfully between the rye spices, the Summit bitterness, and the residual sugars. I might describe this as Hop Rod Lite, but that almost sounds derogatory when it is intended otherwise. Like the over-the-top Hop Rod this is an excellent beer, but here balance plays a much bigger role in the overall appeal; my only complaint is that it may be just a notch too sweet on the tail end of the flavor profile.

For whatever reason, I had relatively high hopes for this beer, but even given those high hopes its a very pleasant surprise to find out just how good this one is. I really wish this was available locally; it could easily become one of my house beers.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Has some good aspects and improves as it warms. Two Bros can do better than this. A 7% abv brew with 68 IBU should have more balance and have a stronger hop profile. That said, this is one of those brews where the entire bottle should be poured into a large glass as it improves when the sediment/yeast, etc. gets poured into the glass. Takes on a creaminess not previously detected. I wish, however, that I had tasted this brew at the Great Taste of the Midwest, where it would have only cost me approx. $1 instead of plunking down $5.49 plus tax at the liquor store for a bomber.

The aroma is really strong with floral and citrus, but the flavor is different.  Theyre definitely in there, but nice and piney.  Funny how that rye turns juicy citrus into pine.  There is some juicy citrus too.  Still, a little weaker on the hops than the BR Hop Rod.  Regardless, a really really tasty beer.  I would (and will) absolutely buy more of this stuff.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"
718,"2006-07-31",4.1,"This is a really good rye beer.  The pour is a reddish color with an off-white head.  The aroma is heavy in the hops department with some spice coming through from the rye.  The taste is full and complex with plenty of the big summit hops coming through followed by a warm, spicey punch from the rye malt.  Reminds me quite a bit of Bear Republics Hop Rod Rye--and its almost that good.","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"

More ordinary scents of grapefruit and caramel are there as well. This is aggressively hoppy in an unfamilar way. It doesnt quite have that foresty brightness, or a plastic astringency, rather its clean and it cuts like a knife. The underlying sweeter notes are mostly buried but noticed enough so the brew is not completely unbalanced. It finishes woody with a hint of berries. Nice.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

718,"2006-07-16",4.1,"From a 22 oz. brown bomber with a blurb on the upper right corner of label, no bottled freshness.

Poured a slightly hazy reddish brown with a foamy off-white that settled into a thin sudsy lacing, minimal amount of sticking.

Aromas of pineapple and orange mixed with pine, a light rye spiciness.

Moderate carbonation and a soft crisp and textured medium bodied mouthfeel.

Spicy rye bready with pine and caramel, the Thai palm sugar gives it a tropical fruitiness, the hops give it a nice sour pine and pepper taste, and a dryish rye bready and hoppy finish. The alcohol provides a good warmth in the palate, but otherwise is well masked, only faintly shows up in the spiciness. Good overall drinkability.

This is, by far, my favorite in the limited run series from Two Brothers, I would recommend picking more than a few of these, should make good trade bait.","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"

Taste is quite spicy in the finish, pretty big bitterness throughout.

A true hopshead aroma. Somewhat silky on the palate, but also seems a bit lifeless. Sweet ruby red grapefruit flavors start things off. Some light melon and orange also. Mid quaff brings some dark caramel, vanilla and rye. Rather sharp finish with a light pepper burn that continues through to the linger. Linger also has a simple sugar flavor with a creme brule quality. Aside from the sharpness at points an enjoyable hopshead brew.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

Juicy again in the flavor, and damn sweet... pine, citrus, and peary hoppage provides a very high level of bitterness all around... caramel, palm sugar, and spiced-up rye form a solid base.  Very good, but a tad too sweet for me.  Lighter on the palate... and a tad tacky at the finish.  Wonderful hoppage level.  Very good stuff!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

718,"2006-07-01",4.0,"Thought I would go with an interesting one for number 300 & this one definitely fit the bill.  Pours deep brown with a frothy tan head with nice retention & lacing.  Aroma has a strange hoppiness - grassy, piney, little bits of raw sugar and a rich smell I cant put my finger on.  Its probably the Thai palm sugar as Im not sure what that smells like.  Medium mouthfeel with light carbonation.  Very interesting taste here, espcially being from Two Brothers.  Hop taste all the way through, quite woody, but not as intense as chinook.  The beer is more dry than expected for having sugar added - it is fairly sharp tasting.  Nice rye dryness on the finish.  There is also a unique bitterness.  Further down the glass there seems to be a bit of creamy / vanilla flavor.  Even further down some sweetness comes out that compliments the hops and rye very well.  Very well done, probably the best Ive had from Two Brothers.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

As the beer warms, I pick up grapefruit and pine notes... especially pine.  It feels a tad thinner than I expected; the back palate is highlighted with a peppered bitterness in the finish.  If I had to guess, I would say it mimics an IPA, sort of.... just not as robust.  It is a bit lighter.  Very unique brew, though...","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"

I dont know if I can pick out a rye beer blind, but this has a definite rye bread taste. Sweetness is not overdone, except for slightly masking the slightly Scots malts. The hops I find really intriguing, like Amarillo whupped by pine branches. A combination of lots of big flavors, all working together in some weird way. I cant find the alcohol either, but I suspect I will notice it later.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

The flavor starts out like a pale ale as well.  A nice hop balance with some caramel malts to even things out.  This beer tasted good, but I swear it is a pale ale and not a strong ale. Maybe it is this high amount of hops.  Still a tasty brew.","Clarksville, Indiana, USA","antzman"
718,"2006-06-22",3.7,"Red and brown with a fluffy, off-white head.  The aroma is crazy pine and grapefruit notes with some sweet caramel, heavy toasted grains, orange zest, spicy rye bread and virtually no alcohol.  The nose when from the bottle is so much better than the nose on draft.  The body is actually a little thin and better when on draft than in the bottle.  When in the mouth, the flavor starts sweet and has some nice punch.  The finish shows some nice, balanced, flavorful hop bitterness and tasty fruit elements.  The alcohol is undectable and the flavors are smooth and highly enjoyable.  Im generally a little disappointed by some of the beers from Two Brothers, but this is one of the better ones Ive had.  After a few draught samples and (at least) one bomber, I prefer the bottle despite the thinner body.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

718,"2006-06-08",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 21, 2006 Draught pint at Redbones on 6/1/06.Deep auburn-amber red, with light gold highlights.  Head is medium sized at first, frothy, off-white and mostly diminishing to cover, with minor lacing.  High clarity, but not crystal clear, with some glassiness to itFruitiness overwhelms (in a good way) in the nose.  Juicy fruits, cherries, strawberries and lightly leafy, juicy hop buds all surge forward, clinging to the nose and allowing the dry, lightly peppery rye notes to slip in on the backend.  Malt is lightly toasty, with a fair dose of sugariness that seems well-suited to the fruity hops.  As it warms and breathes, the aroma dries out somewhat, with a definite perfuminess that I associate with rye, but perhaps incorrectly so, as it could just be some bitter hop acids.  Strength is medium to medium-high and well persistent to the end of the glassThe flavor is no less hoppy, though fortunately for the balance, it is mostly flavoring hops, without the stinging, acidic bitterness.  Rye is lightly nutty, but only coming on in the middle.  The very first sip is lightly chocolatey, with a creamy, engaging mouthfeel that seems both more sweet and deep than Founders Reds Rye.  Not to burst Two Brothers bubble, but this is certainly not far removed from Reds Rye.  A highly hopped red ipa with rye, it certainly is well done.  Fluffy, nearly creamy vanilla-cream sweetness lasts on the finish, as a minor touch of bready malts begin to dry things.  Leafy, fuzzy hops linger on, not as fruity as the beginning, but still bitter and pleasing to the palate, creating balance to the sweet malts.  No alcohol noted in flavor or aroma.  A touch more thin upon warming, but no doubt due to the draught nature (looser carbonation).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
