As she spins in the glass her aromas emanate filling airwaves with malty dark fruits, a note sweet caramel and a hint of herbs. Enticed by this you notice her rounded and smooth body, with a good carbonation giving a swanky mouthfeel. She continues her performance with gathering intensity but as you taste her delights she is dryer than expected. A bitter twist to her performance given by hard hitting herbs that challenges, her promise of malty fruits make little appearance, there is no reprise of the sweet fruity promise just unrelenting dryness. Like the dark talented artiste she is you were duped and drawn into her deception and yet you still just want to drink deeper of this mordant biting babe.

Aroma a caramelo, pasas, chocolate y a pesar de no ser demasiado alcohólica tiene ese punto licoroso que acompaña todo el rato.
Su sabor es delicioso. Regaliz, plátano y un combo café-chocolate que te deja muy loco. Su final comparte caramelo y un amargo muy personal y atrevido.
Se diferencia claramente de otras del estilo en que, sin perder textura aceitosa, tiene un cuerpo mucho más delgado y también en que a pesar de su doble fermentación en botella (y por tanto adición extra de azúcar) es menos dulzona que la mayoría. Resultado: una Dubbel trapense deliciosa y mucho más refrescante de lo acostumbrado.

Par défaut, je mets toujours 5 à lapparence, car une bière cest avant tout des arômes, des saveurs, du plaisir gustatif... Bref, belle brune transparente avec des reflets grenat, surmontée dune mousse fine ivoire. Nez charnu, caramel, chocolat au lait, raisin sec, cassonade, sirop dérable, pain dépice, sirop de canne, pomme et poire cuites, vanille... Très gourmande ! Houblons et alcool très discrets, avec des effluves de mandarine, dorange... Carbonatation moyenne. En bouche, plus de sécheresse quattendue. Première gorgée brute avec une pointe damertume et dastringence qui persistent sur la deuxième. Saveurs minérales, longueur assez courte, je reste sur ma faim. Troisième gorgée qui confirme les précédentes, avec un arrière goût sur les céréales et toujours cette amertume qui colle au palet. La texture est un peu sur leau, elle gagnerait à être plus consistante. Lalcool est bien dosé mais trop peu exploité. Final sur les herbes, la terre, le bois, les levures. Pas une mauvaise bière du tout, mais pas forcément la meilleure Dubbel dabbaye. Je préfère nettement la Maredsous 8 ou la St. Bernardus Pior 8, voir la Chimey Red dans ce style...

Although the beer itself didn't seem overly carbonated, there was a distinct fizziness to the palate which detracted from the flavor.

550,"2016-01-21",4.2,"Kolor : Głęboko miedziany. Bardzo słabe przebłyski w czerwonym odcieniu. 
Piana: Żółta, drobna i wcale nie jest taka najgorsza (jak na Belga).
Utrzymuje się umirkowanie długo, dobrze krążkuje i okleja kielich puszystą kołderką. 
Zapach: Bardzo złożony. Baza podkładowa to ciemne owoce : śliwki, figi, ciemne winogrona.
Na kolejnym pięterku trochę słodkich dodatków: karmel, toffi, syrop cukrowy i alkohol.
W dalekim tle można doszukać się nawet czekoladowych nut.
Oczywiście nie sposób zapomnieć o przyprawowych fenolach (których jest mnóstwo) oraz drożdżowości. 
Smak: Połączenie ciemnych owoców (śliwki, rodzynki, daktyle) z przyprawami (szczególnie pieprz).
Smaki chmielowe niewyczuwalne.
Bogata słodowa baza, balans wyraźnie w kierunku słodu.
Goryczka niska do średniej.
Alkohol miękki, rozgrzewający i nie dominuje.
Piwo jest dość pełne, treściwe.
Wysycenie: Średnie do wysokiego. 
Podsumowanie: 

Jest to najlepszy obecnie ogólnodostępny Dubbel na świecie i swoisty wyznacznik stylu.

Westmalle Dubbel jest piwem którego powtórna fermentacja odbywa się w butelce (kondyncjonowanie w butelce).
Piwo jest warzone w belgijskim klasztorze Westmalle od 1856 roku.

Cechuje go złożoność smaku z charakterystycznymi śliwkami, rodzynkami daktylami.
Lekka pieprzowość oraz rozgrzewający alkohol przypomina nam z jakiej klasy trunkiem mamy do czynienia.
Piwo jest treściwe, smaczne i bardzo szlachetne.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

Nose is molasses, dried ginger, brown sugar, dates, brown bread, black tea, and figs. Its plums and raisins up front, then dark bread and spices kick in; very much a Christmas pudding of a beer, but with a certain monastic restraint. Think of it as a good, balanced Christmas pudding. The plum sticks around on the finish, becoming stronger yet staying restrained, proper, and focused. No booziness or blowsiness at all.

As I have opened it gave a little gush which proved the re-fermentation had some residual effects still or at least the carbonation was not over. In fact the appearance is incredible: tick and never-ending ivory-brownish foamy head, retention. Reddish dark color. Nice! Nose: a parfume of dry fruit with predominance of dry plums, under spirit cherries, so rich and elegant. Mouth: the declination of the flavors due to the aging provides a balanced sweetness which does not disturb at all. Sadly it stays a bit too flat, really. Some reminiscence of the young version, less carbo but same mild bitterness. For me not good for aging but a great one anyway.","Rome, ITALY","ippopotamo36"

550,"2015-11-21",3.8,"7%ABV. Dubbel.

Poured out of the bottle a black brown. 40ºSRM.

Nose has some nice date sweetness to it. There is almost a soda pop citrus sweetness to the nose that is no doubt the product of the carbonation. The strongest aroma profile is that of 7-up.. There is a candy sweet aroma that is like a hard candy.

Mouthfeel is aggressively carbonated and there is a sweet burnt sugar profile that is sweet, and slightly smoky . Almost like the crust on a creme brulee. Could be described as caramel, but it also has a herbal, slightly grassy flavor to it, which lends the flavor to comparison with a local drink of ""grass jelly"" or ""chin chow"". 

Finish is abbreviated and beery. 

This is a traditional product, again, you either like it or you dont and it wont matter one bit since itll just continue to be brewed with the attention that it has in the same manner since forever. A very good example of the style.

Really good. The sweetness is never cloying, and as it fades, theres a very mild lingering bitter that you keep expecting to come forwards - but it doesnt. The bitter stays in the background and never upsets the smooth fruity flavour or the lingering dry finish. Theres a very slight restrained acidity that keeps the mouth feel clean and almost crisp, and brings out the stone fruit flavour. I love hoppy and bitter beers, and this is pretty much the complete antithesis of that: its all about the dark malt fruitiness - and I like it a lot. Theres a reason this is considered a reference dubbel. (18/20)","CANADA","UXO"

550,"2014-09-17",3.8,"Transfer from BA review on 7-6-13-

 Poured from bottle into a chalice glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a hazy brown color with some red highlights shinning through. Upon pouring there is a one finger creamy colored head that fades over a moderate level of time to leave a lighter level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell- The aroma is of roasted malt and some darker fruit smells. The darker fruits are of a plum, raisin and cherry aroma giving a moderately sweet dimension to the smell. When mixed with a yeasty and slightly bready aroma the mix of smells produces a rather nice dubbel aroma.

 Taste- The taste begins with a dry roasted malt flavor and a brown bread taste. There are some dark fruit flavors, but these are on the drier side only adding the fruit flavor without the sweetness. Some light yeastiness and a more bitter citrus flavor begin developing more toward the middle to the end of the taste. In the end with a little bit of a roasted/smoky flavor coming to the tongue, one is left with a dry roasted and dark fruit flavor to linger on the tongue with just a hint of bitterness.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the medium side with a carbonation level that is on the slightly above average side consisting of lots of tiny carbonation bubbles. The combination of carbonation and thickness are nice for the drier flavors creating a very crisp feel overall.

 Overall  It has a nice flavor profile, but is a little drier then what I was expecting for a dubbel. If you are looking for a crisp Belgian style with some good fruit flavors and nice roasted malt taste, then this is a good go too, but if you want something slightly more on the sweeter side then this is not what you want. It is certainly good and something to try if you are in the mood for something drier.","","Darkmagus82"

550,"2014-07-12",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2016 Being Flemish, I grew up with this beer, as in my grandparents days it was practically the only trappist ale widely available in Flanders; the prototype of the dubbel genre and a classic among the Belgians. Tanned, mousse-like, delicately lacing foam, colour deep mahogany, misty; aroma of caramel, walnuts, banana, cloves, coffee grounds, liquorice, hazelnut paste, fondant; taste begins subduedly fruity with a subtle hint of citrus, quite sharp carbonisation, after which a deep caramel- and nut-like maltiness follows, perhaps a bit stiff and harsh when young, dryish, almost woody, yeasty with spicy accents, mineral-like touch, aftertaste leafy and somewhat peppery hops, lightly toasted, long and dry without any trace of cloying sugar, thirs-quenching. Becomes remarkably softer with ageing and I took this into account when scoring. Also one of the few trappists available on draft, then smoother and less harsh and in my opinion more rewarding than a young bottle. Such variations in taste depending on age and means of storage and serving only add to its potential.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

550,"2014-05-06",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2015 RE-RATE: Draft Version @ Chez Sophie, Shrewsbury. Much sweeter due to continuous refermentation in the barrel, and not as highly carbonated, as bottle. Perhaps too sweet, prefer bottle.

330ml bottle from Les Crepes de Sophie, Shrewsbury. Cant believe I havent rated this or the tripel yet. Pretty much the only beer I drank when I lived in France was Westmalle. Cracked this open and drank in a big flowery park. Pours deep brown with a nice big head. That smooth, reasurring caramel flavour is there from the start, settling you in before hints of chocolate and dark fruits come through in a way only this Dubbel can. Satisfying and somewhat light for a dark Belgian beer. The original and best, no doubt about that.","Shrewsbury, Shropshire, ENGLAND","minutemat"
550,"2014-05-04",3.6,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance was a dark brown color with some hazy ruby edges, not much lacing, but what there is clings sporadicly around the edges. The head lasts oh, probably about a good minute.
The smell had some glazed apples - coming through kinda sugary, cinnamon - perhaps. I like the nice spice that allocates itself fairly nicely to the aroma.
The taste was mainly sweet but still theres a nice spice to the flavoring. The aftertaste - uh...well, there isnt any aftertaste - ok, well, no worries. I got a quick dry finish.
On the palate, it sits about a light to medium, sessionability - hmmm....not quite. I can tell it wants to be, but for the most part, in my opinion, it seems to sit closer to the medium aspect. Carbonation seems to be a tad sharper than most Dubbels Ive had, but still worthy of being construed as a Dubbel.
Overall, in my opinion, this is a pretty good Dubbel well worthy of having again despite having a harsher carbonation than most.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

550,"2014-01-12",4.2,".33L bottle served in a Belgian snifter. BB dated 28 Jan. 2015 - but i didnt want to wait any longer. This was my favorite beer for a while, during and following a visit to Belgium. I havent had it for a while except one small tasting, so lets see how it holds up. 

Appearance: dark brown with a variable density light brown head. Good retention and lacing. Some sediment remained in the bottle even after extracting every last drop of liquid. 

Smell: Dark bread with a load of raisins, dates, ripe bananas and generic dried dark fruits. Hints of pears, dried plums and spices. Light alcohol esters.

Taste: Similar to aroma profile but stronger, with more plum, and less sweet. This 7% ale drinks like 3-4%. Rich, bitter-sweet, durable flavor. 

Feel: Smooth, medium-full body; medium carbonation that seems just right. 

Overall: Excellent! World class for style. Unfortunately not cheap in the U.S. Engaging, flavorful, interesting and easy to drink. Highly recommended.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

550,"2013-12-31",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2014 It is a pleasure to watch the lively carbonation rise up from the bottom of the hazy dark brown body to form the frothy beige head. Nice. The hearty nose contains caramel, apple, plum, and banana notes. The flavor is very rich; up front, it is dominated by sweet caramelized maltose before it makes the transition to dark fruitiness with prune, fig, cooked apple, and banana notes. The hops take a minor supporting role to the roasty malts, but it shines through in the finish in form of subtle bitterness along the well-hidden alcohol heat and doughy yeast, both of which stay in the background on the mid palate. The mouthfeel is outstandingly pleasant; with a body as full as this, just the right amount of carbonation adds the crispness that complements the rest of the features this beer has to offer, and the way it bubbles up while swirling it around in the mouth is genuinely intriguing. As great as one would expect from the mother of dubbel.","Berlin, GERMANY","Schnabelhund"

Theres a sweetness too in the smell and at times I catch a whiff of pear drops (but not overpoweringly). Its less sweet than I suspected upon tasting and very complex and pleasingly bitter with a light sourness too.

550,"2013-11-30",4.5,"Pours a handsome dark brown with honey like hues of lighter brown at the edges and where the glass will allow some light to pass through. The head is fat, tan and creamy. Falls slowly and leaves slippery lace. Nose is is exhilarating and dark. it has belgian woody yeast that promises a bit of dryness and is somewhat restrained but for a bit of apple and a very faint banana. There is a sweet light chocolate and deep smooth caramel on the nose. Dark fruits like fig and date but lively with the crispness of that apple behind them. The caramel just goes on forever in the nose. 

The taste is poetry. The nose of this beer seems to vibrate at an excited pitch. The fruits all ripe and clamoring for their peak, the caramel at its richest, the chocolate enticing and light over the top, the yeast falling to the background as it will fall to the middle of the beer in the drink. Then pure composure greets the palate. Smooth, creamy rich but not heavy. The bread soft and sweet and laced with dark fruit, endless caramel and light sweet chocolate. The yeast brings a dryness to the middle of the beer and there is a slight bitter undertone. It reminds me of molasses. The alcohol stops out just slightly, a bit impudent it seems to impart a sweet bit of warmth as it finishes. The fruits and floral take the last ideation of this beer on the palate as it fades to aftertaste with a bit of caramel to linger instead of the alcohol.

Het aroma is fris zoet en fruitig. De frisse citrus geur nodigt uit tot proeven. Het uiterlijk is donker bruin met en volle mokka kleurige schuimkraag.
De smaak is eenvoudig doch perfect in balans. Het is een verfrissend bier waarvan de smaak balanceert tussen iets fruitig met en bittere toets die doet denken aan pompelmoes. De zoete smaak doet denken aan het zoete van in marsepein, doch blijft discreet op de achtergrond.
Het mondgevoel is verfrissend, sprankelend bruisend en weinig klef waardoor de trappist van Westmalle gemakkelijk en smakelijk wegdrinkt. Aangezien dit bier ook een eerder beperkt alcohol volume heeft is dit een mooi en verfrissend alternatief voor de toch wel zware tripel.

About a 1 finger tall tan rocky head with fair retention. Some lace, but not too much. Lots of sediment floating in the brew, some yeast looking floaters but also some dark particles also. Sweet malty aroma. Lots of dark fruits; raisens, figs, maybe a little plum. Some hints of toasted malts and caramel. Like the smell getting a lot of dark fruit in the taste also. Very rich and sweet. Little boozy. Silky mouthfeel on a medium body. Another great trappist ale.

I dont get that, I think the Trappist Dubbel is the most sublime of all beers and for my taste this one is the quintessential Dubbel. The Monks at Westmalle brewery are credited with brewing the first of what is now called a Dubble ale; Based on the Dubbels that I have tried, I dont think that the style has been perfected. Right after opening the bottle you are hit with a yeasty and bready bouquet, after it warms up a little you get the dark fruit and candied sugar notes with a slight hoppyness; every thing balances perfectly. If I had to choose just one beer to enjoy for the rest of my life it would probably be between this or The Rochefort 8. Good on ya, Monk brothers.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","StouterRick"

Overall, unforgettable.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","barakihunter"

Pours a clear very dark brown, nearly opaque. Topped by a huge billowy off-white head that keeps growing thanks to the abundant carbonation. Some of the best head retention I have every seen.

Aroma has lots of dark fruit such as figs and cherries layered on top of wood. Hints of pipe tobacco along with wet grass and hay. A little bit of light cocoa underneath.

The flavor really has tons going on. Like in the aroma, dark fruit predominantly up front consisting largely of cherries and figs. A decent woody note is present along with a little bit of must although it nicely compliments the other flavors. Grass comes in next along with a moderate, cleansing bitterness. The beer finishes dry on the palate with bitterness lingering long after all other flavors depart.

Luckily this beer is so well made, the BBD isnt an issue.

Poured slowly, oh so slowly into my Westmalle Chalice, it looked super. I allowed the sediment to join the beer, as I like to taste and feel the whole product and enjoy the extra strenght and flavours the sediment gives.

I am no stranger to this wonderful beer, but I have never reviewed it while in Belgium, prefering to just enjoy the moment whenever I have drank it before.

Deep mahogany red in colour, with a slight haze because of my prefered pour. The tan creamy head, at first full slips slowly into a thinner carpet of foam which laces the glass as the beer is sipped.

Plums and raisens, rich malts and some toasted caramel give this beer a unique aroma, one I could detect anywhere.

The taste is just as you would expect from the aroma. It is rich, but isnt as creamy maybe and it is fairly high in the carbonisation stakes for a Dubbel, but I think that adds to its character and uniqueness.

Some spotty lacing clings to the glass as well; with plenty of carbonation streaming up from the bottom creating a creamier head than on the pour.  Aromas of huge raisin, caramel, molasses, prunes, biscuit, roasted nuts, light chocolate, and yeast spices.  Big malty aromas here with good strength and balance.  Taste of big caramel, molasses, pepper, chocolate, roasted nut, biscuit, dark fruit, and spicy yeast.  Lingering notes of biscuit, caramel, chocolate, pepper, and yeast spices on the finish for a bit.  Nice malty flavor with no cloying, and less spiciness than I was expecting from the yeast.  Medium bodied with lively carbonation; with a fairly creamy and very smooth mouthfeel.  Drinks incredibly easily with the high carbonation as well.

550,"2011-09-05",4.0,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Tulip.

Appearance: Extremely dark ruby with massive, billowing tan head that leaves bubbles sticking to everything it touches. Wonderful.

Aroma: Very fruity (raisins, apples, banana) with some light clove and caramel. Most of the aroma dissipates after a few minutes.

Taste: Strong raisin and banana, fairly sweet, somewhat offset by clove, nuts, hops and pepper at the finish. There is a little caramel malt undercurrent, but the sweet, earthy and almost funky fruitiness really reigns supreme. A little unbalanced for me, but still very enjoyable.

Palate: Moderately high carbonation, medium but almost thin body. However, it became very smooth after I accidentally overpoured the second half and got foam all over my table.

Overall: Another world class Dubbel that I find to be enjoyable, but does not quite knock my socks off. Not sure why, as I like Quads and Belgian Strong Dark Ales a lot.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

550,"2011-06-04",3.9,"Das Dubbel beginnt mild malzig, wobei sich dieser Ton mit der Zeit deutlich verstärken wird. Sehr voluminös breitet sich ein süß und rauchig wirkender Ton aus, deutlich würzig, aber nicht sehr stark. Das Bier scheint sich bewusst auf diese Töne zu konzentrieren, ohne überladen zu wirken, was zweifelsohne gelingt. Die nun stärker gewordene Malzigkeit ist nun der Mittelpunkt des Bieres, kräftig, dennoch weich, das Bier bleibt süffig. Wieder ist das Bier kurz alkoholisch, aber keinesfalls störend. Gelungenes und empfehlenswertes Bier.

Dark brown colour, reddish brown glow. Firm beige creamy head. Aroma of malts, dried fruits, spicy yeast and a touch of candy sugar. Flavour is rather sweet. Malty, dried fruits, molasses, only very slight hops, yeast, spices (cloves and light liquorice), surprisingly dry for such a sweetish hefty beer. Some burnt malts bitterness in the finish.

Malty aroma, little fruity and very pleasant. 
Maltiness stays from the aroma. Slight alcohol taste. Balanced well though. Taste of raisins, a bit sweet with a bit of bitterness which might be from the carbonation.
Tastes thinner than it looks and finishes drier than one would think. All due to the carbonation, which is expectedly high.
I prefer the Dubbel as opposed to the Tripel as it seems the sweetness of this one makes it more palatable to me. The lower alcohol also helps with the drinkability, but this isnt something you would want to drink all day long. Especially on a hot day.

550,"2011-02-09",4.4,"Westmalle Dubbel comes in what I think is the coolest looking bottle I have yet seen in my beer reviewing. Something about it just suits the beer it contains. Maybe it is because my mental image of monks is a round body with no waist, then the collar of their robes, and then a thinner head sticking out.

I eventually settled on using an oversized Riedel white wine glass for Westmalle Dubbel and it worked out quite well.

The beer poured an extremely deep reddish brown that became ruby at the edges where all the light hitting the beer is seemingly absorbed into a black hole.

The head developed 2  3 fingers thick and almost impossibly dense and creamy. The head held fast at virtually the same level it poured for minutes after. I didnt notice any change until I started to drink the beer. Even as I let it warm up a few degrees the head only receded a small amount. This beer leaves copious amounts of fine Belgian lace on the glass.

My first sniffs revealed to me that the beer was too cold to be properly appreciated. I was strained to identify much. I waited several minutes for the beer to warm up a few degrees and tried again. Despite expecting some change  I was shocked at the difference. The aroma of the beer livened right up and unleashed a complex symphony of smells.

The conductor of this symphony is clearly the malts  they first great you to the performance and immediately make known their quality credentials. The malts smell a little sweet and bready with an undertone of caramel and toffee. Subsequent sniffs reveal dark cherry and plums. I can smell the slightest bit of muskiness which I would think is the unique Belgian yeast that Westmalle uses in all of its beers.

The taste  to continue the analogy  is like watching that same symphony from a different seat. New things are visible but this is still the same performance. I can again tell the malts form the backbone of this beer  they taste bold and a little bready. After I the dark fruit flavors finish I start to taste a few new things  light cocoa and very faint coffee. Filtering this through what I know about producing Westmalle Dubbel I am inclined to think this is from the kilned malts.

There is a sweetness to the beer as a whole  probably from the caramelized liquid syrup added. There is a bit of a dry finish with a warming alcohol sensation.

The mouthfeel is not too heavy but is definitely not thin. It has a creamy and smooth texture that goes down very easily. It is quite effervescent and if rolled in the mouth for a while you can feel the carbonation tingling.

Overall  this is an extremely well brewed beer. It all balances very well and is a great sipper  although gulps are not out of the question. This is getting 4 pints but it was extremely close to rounding up to 5.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","gramity"

550,"2010-12-26",3.4,"UPDATED: DEC 28, 2010 330 ml, BB date reads 12. November 2010, into 180 ml Chimay chalice. Up until today Ive been waiting to open this one to enjoy the benefits of maturation. Pours effervescent, deep reddish coppery body with good clarity, topped by medium, beige dense head with good retention that gradually sets to a stable cloth. Nice lacing on the walls.
The nose is low maltiness dominated by fruity esters of plum, apple and raisins, light phenolic spiciness and apparent perfumy qualities probably originating from higher alcohols. Occasionally some extra sweetness emerges enhancing the perception of malt. The flavor is surprisingly unsweet, lacking prominent malt perception, estery with fruity tartness of plum, apple and raisins, light bitterness with moderately dry finish and some yeastiness. Light to medium bodied with rather high carbonation. A year of cellaring hasnt taken away much of the tartness (without diminishing the fruitiness) as I hoped for and which was the case with some previously tasted bottles.

In short: a rather dry, tart and estery dubbel with attractive reddish depth.

UPDATE 12-28-2010:
This bottle has been aged a year over the declared best before date (18.December 2009).
A gusher, although once poured exhibits less effervescence than a year younger bottle tasted previous evening. Pour into baby-Chimay chalice (180 ml) gives birth to a deep amber-coppery clear body with some haze, overlain by beige head that completely dissipates in a short time. The aroma is rich and complex yet discrete malty sweetness with faint chocolaty notes, hint of caramel and light toastiness, abundant fruity esters of ripened plum and raisins, port-wine reminiscent qualities, some spicy phenolics and apparent higher alcohol-derived perfuminess. The flavor is complex malty sweetness with light toasty notes, plums & raisins lacking the prominent, almost berry-like tartness of a young Westmalle, light bitterness, some phenolic spiciness and yeasty notes. The malty sensation persists into the semi-dry finish. Nearly medium bodied with rather flat carbonation.
A year past its declared BB date, the Westmalle Dubbel is mainly distinguished from his above reviewed younger brother by more pronounced sweetness enhancing the malt-perception, absence of fruity tartness and poorly sustained head with less carbonated body. The scores for this one are 9, 3, 8, 2, 15 = 3,7","SLOVENIA","EvilBuddha"

550,"2010-09-04",3.9,"Aroma of raisins and nuts, with a little dark cherry and some herbal notes.  Has a huge, cream colored head that slowly dissipates and leaves lacing.  Color is dark brown with an orange-red tinge.  This is a very fruity beer, with the focus mainly on the malt and yeast.  It seems to have elements of all of the flavors, it starts off sweet, then tastes somewhat bitter and sour, and even has a little saltiness.  The flavors are very subtle and not overwhelming at all.  It is highly carbonated, with a full body and slick texture.  The finish is sweet, sour, and bitter all at once, and is quite long.  The alcohol is quite noticeable, this beer really packs a punch.  I think it lives up to the hype overall.  The high price makes it an occasional treat.","San Diego, California, USA","Stuedmaster"

550,"2010-08-23",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2017 [8/10] Mahogany with a fat coat of beige head. Smells of stewed prunes, cheesy yeast, caramel, vanilla. Taste is sweet fruity with dough and spices. Quite light mouthfeel is rather too carbonated at first. Depth of malt and yeast emerges with a careful swirl or two in their distinctly unswirl-friendly glass. Some citrus sourness and mild spicy bitterness in a long dry finish. Good but not a knockout. [3.5] [3/17] I havent seen what others have in Westmalle yet. This is not the first revisit, but this time is a lot better (and Im guessing its just fresher): cleaner with prunes, dried banana, raisins, strong bread. Bitter with quite punchy spices in the dry finish.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

The complex milieu of aromas and flavours are in unity - sweet brown sugar, toffee, ripe dark fruit especially raisin, almond/marzipan, spicy cinnamon, yeasty especially cheese, mild bitter chocolate, slight sour green apple  Although the Westmalle Tripel  was outstanding and noticeably better than this, the Dubbel is still absolutely delightful.","Tauranga, NEW ZEALAND","beer4eternity"
550,"2010-08-14",4.0,"Served from bottle to a Westmalle chalice.

Taste: Alcohol, malts, brown sugar, raisins.

Palate: feels little watery, not much of a lingering flavor.

As personal preference, from trappist beers I like better Chimay for its spiciness, or Rochefort 10.

But then again its a good beer, for me in this kind its not the best and Im in the hunt for the Westvleteren so it might go down another notch in the trappist war if theres any.","SPAIN","arturorg"

550,"2010-07-07",4.5,"Bottle poured in Westmalle glass. Pours a very dark brown beer with a nice tanned head. Westmalle Dubbel is bottle conditioned so there is a lot of carbonation going on. My example had a distinct aroma of apples, it kind of surprised me since this is something I normally associate with Geuze Lambics. Taste is again apples at first and then the sweet, smooth taste of malt and raisins perhaps (?). Aftertaste lasts quite a while. Westmalle Dubbel is one of the best examples of a strong dark trappist ale. Just like their Tripel, the Dubbel is another winner from Westmalle. Highly recommended.","NETHERLANDS","Juergen_F"

The aroma is negligible, with nothing standing out. Some cherry flavour, with a cough mixture taste in the finish, and a trace of banana which lingers well in the mouth. For 7%, it lacks body and becomes syrupy. It has the alcoholic taste, but not the pleasing, warming sensation I had hoped for, a yeasty aroma develops towards the end.

A - Dark, slightly cloudy, ruby color with a good sized foamy toasted marshmallow colored head. Average retention and a thin layer of patchy lacing left.

S - A lot of dried dark cherry and raisin along with some other dark fruit. Some juicy apple and a bit of citrus. Good amount of caramel and dark malt aroma. Pretty sweet with a slight fruity tartness, particularly from the dark cherry.

T - Starts with some dark and a bit of a bready taste of malt. Hints of caramel and very slight chocolate flavor. Some dark fruit comes out on top of this with plum and raisin being strongest. Some raisin and citrus accompanies these and some spice, cinnamon and nutmeg being the strongest. A slightly sweet and tart and juicy finish.

M - Medium body with just a bit more than average carbonation. Pretty smooth and creamy.

D - Very drinkable, with a variety of flavors that are well balanced. Juicy and pretty refreshing, and I would gladly have another.

Notes: Best before 23/09/11. A very solid beer and good example of the style. Quite a bit of dark fruit, with a nice dark malt base.

Aroma is of plums and grapes with some pepper alongside.  Mouthfeel is light but very well carbonated, it tastes better after a few minutes when the carbonation has subsided.  Taste is of dark fruit, plums, berries... and mainly of spice.  This beer has a lot of bite to it!  Pretty cool.  It reminds me of Orval but a little more subdued... and of course dark.

550,"2010-03-25",4.3,"33cl/330ml bottle poured into a Chimay glass...

Appearance - Cloudy dark maroon in colour, with a rich rocky caramel head. Good head retention and some lacing.

Aroma - Roasted malts, floral notes, and a pretty strong fruit profile (apples, banana, cherries, dates, etc.). Slightly acidic and yeasty. Very inviting.

Taste - Starts you off with some solid roasted bready maltiness, then going into a fruity combination, courtesy of the yeast strain. I was getting cherries, apples, and a bit of banana for the most part. Then you get some mild cinnamon spice and a bit of floral hops. Perhaps one could taste a little chocolate as well. Quite dry in the finish, with some lingering roasty bitterness. Quite complex overall, and definitely smooth.

Palate - Medium-bodied, a little crisp at first, but overall it is quite smooth. Not too peppery or spicy, but a little acidic. The alcohol is well-masked.

This has got to be one of the best dubbels Ive had, and I think it is a little step above Chimay Red (but Im probably being subjective). Very balanced beer: not too complicated, yet full-flavoured and interesting.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","DenisLD"

The bubbly, ticklish carbonation suits this brew well, livening up what otherwise couldve been a too sluggish brew. Taste is mild candy sugar, some caramel, oak, fruity esters and hints of raisin. Smooth, but could have been more feisty in the ways of flavor. Still, this dubbel is very true - in fact exemplary - to its style, and I gotta give credit where credit is due.

A very deep ruby color. It looks fantastic when held to a light. Develops a huge, 3 finger light brown head that sticks around for a good while. Some lacings and plenty of foam linger on.

A lovely smell of fresh fruit. Some yeast aromas, going towards the smell of banana, as well. Plenty of sweet notes from malts and chocolate.

Plenty of sweet malts and fruit - mostly red currants and banana. Then, a tarter fruitiness - like red apples just a little unripe, or just apple peel - appears. A gentle spiciness and soothing chocolate flavors round things off. The finish has a very mild bitterness and a restrained hop character, is somewhat spicy and slightly tart (but by no means sours). The alcohol is warming.

Medium body. Plenty of carbonation. Slightly coarse and crisp, but still rather smooth.

The fruit character in this one is just amazing, great balance between sweetness and tartness - very refreshing. Truly complex and well balanced. Perhaps, I would have liked just a little more bite in the finish.

A 12 oz. Alone on my porch. Fairly good mood. Especially now that I am drinking this. Beer appears orange brown with thin beige lasting head. Aroma was initially a fusel alcohol festival, with higher alcohol notes of roses and that eye opening effect that rubbing alcohol has when you sniff it deeply bringing a very pleasant perfumy-ness to the fruits which dominate with apples and other fruits. As it warms it becomes more about fruits but you still since the booze and a caramelly rum fruit drink kind of thing starts happening. Phenols play hard here too. Spiciness. Flavor follows suit but a lot more chocolate, which i forgot to mention a note of in aroma comes out much much larger. Starts sweet but goes dry quickly and lasts.

I was expecting much from this and perhaps thats where the letdown come from.  Huge fan of Trappist ales.  This one didnt have as much taste as Id hoped.  I tried the Chimay Trappist the day before and it was so delicious that this seemed almost dull in comparison.

Poured nice and dark didnt have any strong scents.  The head was phenominal.  The taste though, was like a good dark ale.  Not as spicy and diverse as Id come to expect from other Trappist ales.

Medium carbonation and mouthfeel. Dry hoppy finish and mildly spicy, but lasting, bitter aftertaste. Alcohol (7 %) is well-integrated, and in all other respects, too, this is a superbly crafted and well-balanced beer.  Unlike other dubbels, this one seems suitable as a session beer as well.

Appearance is a dark-reddish brown with a small head that sticks around pretty well but is not more than a centimeter high. The smell of this beer reminded me of grapes and red wine and me anticipate the taste even though I dont drink wine. The taste is delicious but doesnt quite match up with the smell but that is ok. It is also thick and hard to describe. Its dark and fruity but not really spicy at all, maybe some nuttiness. Good bubbly carbonation and very easy to drink, this is a nice beer.

Flavor contains some oakiness, grape but the grape isnt nearly as strong as in the aroma, the alcohol comes across fairly harsh but its hidden under the sweetness of the brew. Beer finishes with a touch of spice and some floral notes and comes across very light. Beer becomes way more smooth and maltier the closer to room temperature it gets compared to the 12 degrees it started at. Mouth feel felt surprisingly thin maybe even to thin.

550,"2009-03-03",3.9,"12 oz bottle. Another trappist brewery added to my selection, very excited for it. Pours a dark brown with a light tan head that is about a finger high. Amazed at how long the head stays (though part of it might be because I poured it into the wrong glass by mistake), and how full bodied the head is. Smells of dried apricot, raisins, and other dried dark fruit. Reminds me a lot of Chimay Reds smell. Tastes of raisin, caramel, yeast, and dried fruit. Goes down with a bit of a carbonation bite, but I love that. Overall very good.","Highland Park, Illinois, USA","soccer290"

It has a fruity aroma, with notes of apple, raisin, banana and clove. It is medium-light bodied; bubbly, with a dry, slightly gritty finish, almost like it was dry hopped. It is a simple flavor thats pretty well bittered. Its a bit sour and a touch sweet, with notes of leather, pepper, hay, juniper and brett. OK, maybe its not all that simple, but the flavors are very fused. This is a pretty solid Dubbel.","Fairport, New York, USA","yesyouam"

Pours a a purplish-brown color, murky, with a thin, fluffy tan head that fades into a thin, creamy cap that lasts the entire beer. 

Nose is light dark fruits and brown sugar, with some spicy yeast lending a light, doughy character to the smell. Just a hint of spicy alcohol lends some interesting depth.

Taste is intense - up front, you get a big, yeasty, doughy malt note full of dark fruit and some brown sugar, followed by a sweet, rich lingering dark fruit note that fades into a dry, slightly yeasty finish.

550,"2009-01-29",3.9,"Bouteille brune de 330ml, achetée à la LCBO Rideau/King Edwards.  Dégustée dans un calice Westmalle original.  Le nez est assez discret.  On remarque entre autre de la levure, du chocolat, des raisins secs et un soupçon de vanille.  En apparence, le liquide est foncé et dune magnifique couleur rubis sous la lumière.  Une mince couche de mousse sestompe lentement.  On remarque également de minuscules sédiments en suspend dans la bière.  En bouche, dès que lon avale, un picotement remarqué se fait ressentir.  La bière est très effervescente.  Cela lui donne du corps et une sensation de velouté/douceur par la suite.  Cest sucré (chocolat/raisin) et amer (levure), mais le tout est si équilibré quon doit bien réfléchir lorsquon décortique cette bière.  En finale, cest lamertume de la levure et un léger goût de vanille qui ressort.  Bière dégustée en accompagnement dun rôti de porc aux pommes et aux pruneaux ayant mijoté 9 heures.  Un accompagnement idéal.  Une grande bière trappiste, humble et sans haute voltige, mais remarquable pas son équilibre.

From that moment on all i smell and taste is new sneakers, i tried, i wrote down caramel, almost winelike in texture, slightly vinegarous(sour), but i kept coming back to New Sneakers...

The flavors are dry, of roasted caramel balancing nicely with sour fruity hues.  The finish closes cleanly, with hints of roasted light bitters.  The mouthfeel is thick, although a bit overcarbonated, with light alcohol notes to pepper the back-palate.  Somewhat simplistic in nature, this brew is a nice offering on the Trappist Dubbel style.","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"

Flavour is really good, and not what Ive come to expect from Dubbels. Lots of the sweet malty aspects upfront, met with some nice herbal hops, a touch of alcohol, and rounding out very sharply with a lot of yeasty dryness. Mild hint of banana. The fruity esters in this one are just great. Very sharp. Some leafy hops are present in the flavour too, but were absent in the aroma.

Lots going on in the nose but all very subtle. Very malty tasting with a little bit O’ hops. Has a bit of a sour finish that I don’t care for but is very smooth regardless.

550,"2008-08-05",3.6,"From the second round of my own annual Beer of the Year sweet 16 tourney.  This round consisted of Abbey Dubbels and Tripels.  What an awesome night.  Westmalle Dubbel was the first beer of the round to be rated: In a trappist glass, this ale produces a hazy, brandy-like, medium brown body, with a fuzzy beige head and a small ring of retention.  An immediate malty sweet fruitiness fills the aroma.  Cloves, passion-fruit, fresh cream, and a little banana drift along, with more spices and molasses following up.  The mouthfeel is excellently smooth and velvety, with little carbonation.  The appearance leads you to believe this beer is really strong, but the body is relatively light, smooth, and easygoing.  Plenty of exotic fruit, cinammon, banana peel, and apricot.  The house yeast is noticeable in the taste, leaving lively notes of chestnuts and caramel, and, as the beer warms, a very strong whiskey taste tingles the taste buds and offers up sappy, peated malt.  Overall, this has a great long, slight dry finish and is incredibly smooth going down.  Very well crafted Trappist Ale. (of course)","Independence, Kentucky, USA","shalloWMeans"

550,"2008-02-14",4.5,"This wonderful beer is pretty much what I think of when I think of an abbey dubbel.  Its very dark red with a huge light tanhead thats long-lasting and leaves a bit of lace.  The aroma is a bit like a barleywine, with rich dark malty qualities, caramel, toast, yeasty bread dough, and fruit with hints of alcohol.  The taste is first malty sweet, spicey fruit and toast with smooth, warming alcohol - also a bit like a barleywine.  Then it becomes more bitter in the spiciness with more caramel, cehrries, prunes, etc., and balances out nicely.  It is a rich, complex, but smooth and easy-to drink dubbel.","California, USA","Wulfstan"

Belgian yeast and dark fruits highlight the nose, along with a hint of purest water from a stone well (that’s what I get anyway).

[rerate 10.25.09] 11.2 oz bottle.  Pours a darker shinny brown with a huge foamy root-beer float like rocky head.  Aroma is sweet and bready, dark sugar, raisins, hint of plums, touch metallic, trappist yeast note is nice.  First taste is a bit bready, dark rye, bitter, plummy yeast, odd metallicness, subtle sweetness, flavor vacantly detached from the airy body, lightly nutty, bitter plumy yeast aftertaste and long lingering dry charcoal.  Medium bodied, big corse fluffy airy carbonation. I appreciate this in a different way after trying the Westvleteren offerings.  Age has dried it out in a nice way, but some of the oxidation notes are distracting

Tounge is enveloped with velvet of gentle malts and hops that build to a stong tinglyness of fruit..mostly cherries but a whip or two of ripe mellons.

Very dry end is nutty, [regular-] grassy, and complex.  Balanced and smooth.  Darkly, portentiously fruity with a medium-full body.

Extremely faint tartness.  Only light hoppiness and very little of the nuttiness I noted earlier; gently warming in the chest and no sign of alcohol in the mouth, though theres some roughness that should have mellowed by now.

The initial flavor was moderately sweet and lightly acidic, while the finish was moderately to heavily sweet and lightly acidic and bitter with an average duration.

Upon opening and pouring the beautiful bouquet of raisins and undertones of carmelized malts blossoms to fill the area with its uniquely magnificent scent.  The anticipation of the first sip is only heightened by actually taking the first sip and realizing the tantalizing aromas are fulfilled in the rich textures and excellent blend of flavors.  Rasins, malts, and prunes balanced to cradle each one as it delicously tantalizes your taste buds. The feeling is of a smooth, not light, but not heavy silky liquid that embraces your mouth and slides down the throat easily.  The lingering fruity malty and just mildly alchoholic flavors blend to leave you wanting the next sip.

Not an extremely complex aroma but it is outstanding and very inviting. Theres a hearty body with this Dubbel that provides an exceptional smoothness. Not too thick, but still very creamy. Theres a wonderful underlying flavor of juicy red wine, this is initially noticed in the aroma but it really thrives as the base of a great well rounded flavor. Mild earthiness with some even milder smoked nuttiness. Moderately bitter notes are detected here and there, but this gets overshadowed by the fermented sweetness.

Oh, yes it’s a good beer, even great, but doesn’t even stand in the shadow of the Gouden Carolus.  Very hoppy, more so than most Belgians, and especially more so than most dubbels.  There are excellent subtle flavors behind the hoppy dryness, but too well covered up.  Medicinal herbs and astringent hops is the main profile.  If this had some malt sweetness or some Belgian candy it would have been spectacular, but as is its only good.  If you like dry Belgian ales you will love this but if you prefer some sweetness, you will be disappointed, as I was.","Orange Park, Florida, USA","yayforbeer"

Some woody, madeira-like elements. The flavor is very rich and sweet with reminiscent woody characteristics. Rather vinous. This beer has a pleasant bitterness. A very well balanced dubbel with a sharp and spicy taste. Lots of caramel with hints of black chocolate. The finish is bitter with some dark chocolate that comes through.. I was impressed by this dubbel! Additional comment: An excellent trappist - slightly sour. Woody and vinous. Some candied fruits showing up. Unique. Third rerate: Excellent. Huge amonts of aniseed, chocolate, pineapple, homemade caramel, candy and sage showing up in both aroma and flavor. Good bitterness. Absolutely fantastic.

It poured well in my 50cl glass (a great find at Crate/Barrel) to form a cheerful oatmeal head, with lingering bubbles beneath. 

The first taste changed my mind about dubbel style ales as the candy-fruit, coffee, caramel, and hops all exploded at once. Im sorry I only purchased one bottle as this was just outstandingly smooth with bitter traces reminding me how much I enjoyed it.

I found this to be very drinkable and I was wondering, as I always do with great beer in a bottle, what the ale would be like on tap...an exciting idea as I know barrels are available of this one, but not the Triple, in the USA.","Jacksonville, Florida, USA","bonbright7"

Starts with a warm shower of deeply toasted malts and coffee-cocoa tones which become balanced with some tame but assertive hop bearing...mid palate the mix gets more complex, there are a number of flavor decernments but the one that stands out is that of a chocolate covered smoked apple...finishes wet with more flavors arriving late;earthy dates, toffee-earthiness and smokey fruits...add to this a dangerous drinkability and inherent smoothness and we have one of the worlds best beers.

There is little I can say compared to the accolades this beer has had from proper critics....all I know is that I wish I had a consatant access to it...if I did I may lose my love of German dunkler bocks.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

Poured a deep plummy caramel with a delicate and creamy cap of yellowy-beige head... left a nice, thorough lacing as it went down.  Nose picked up a hefty dose of plum and raisiny fruits, dry, almost dusty notes of earth, and lesser notes of chocolate.  The flavor department began with spicy and lightly sour hops, transitioning well into a creamy middle of darker fruits and caramel.. with spicy earth returning for the finish.. rather dry across the palate with a heavy yeast presence.. the finish didnt carry much weight and felt almost empty after the fuller body.

550,"2006-12-13",3.3,"A 33cl bottle from the Systembolget. A puff on gunsmke on opening, and a volcanic spotted tan head despite a slow pour that popped and crackled down to a thin, lasting cap above a ruby red and brown body.
The aroma confused me - mushrooms and earth and paper mache. Expected some dark fruit and malt, but struggled to find it. It smelt old - a touch oxidized.
This translated to the taste, which was a little thin, dry and a nice hoppy bitter finish. The mouthfeel was slightly electrically charged, like the sensation you get immediately after an electrical storm. There is some caramel in there, but not much, and a suggestion of strawberries.","Umeå, SWEDEN","lagomswedish"

550,"2006-10-10",3.8,"I finally got my hands on this beer when the LCBO got their autumn stock in.  It pours a beautiful dark golden-brown, with a very serious head.  The head is the kind that forms a mountain above the rim of the glass, without spilling over.  The carbonation is very fine, producing tiny bubbles long after the initial pour.  The head maintains its shape, and never really fades.

The aroma is wonderful, and quite complex.  Sweetness and yeast abound, and a fresh citrus/fruit sort of smell that is buried at first.

The taste is surprisingly light for a beer that looks so bold, and has such a high alcohol content.  The carbonation feels very smooth in the mouth, and compliments the taste of the beer well.  To be honest, Id say it tastes like a weaker Chimay Rouge.  Many of the same qualities as the Chimay, just more subtle.  Wonderful aftertaste that remains smooth throughout with a small hint of grassiness and bread dough.

Overall, this is a very very nice beer.  Ill be sure to enjoy it on many more occasions!  If youre looking for a bolder, more flavorful beer, the Chimay is a better bet, but the Westmalle is definitely a nice change of pace.","Ontario, CANADA","opc"

550,"2006-09-27",4.3,"Pours a deep brown with a tan head that faded to a thin cap on the beer that lasted right down to the final sip.  The aroma here is intense and variable:  my first attempt was all dark fruit, dominated by raisin.  Second go of it found some yeasty spiciness, while the third was sweet and malty.  The taste is similar.  The flavors are layered one on top of another, but in a noticeably subtle way:  one sip brings roasty malts and caramel, with a spiciness in the finish.  The next brings dark fruits and a fading bitterness at the sides of the tongue.  As for mouthfeel, the carbonation here is lively upon first digging in, and fades as the beer sits and warms.  It is more drinkable at the beginning but easier to appreciate the flavors at the end - both work to admirable goals, and never is the beer watery in the slightest - even acquiring a distinct creaminess as it warms.","Ithaca, New York, USA","dmradus"

Aromas of yeast, dusty powdered sugar, roasty and caramelly malts, a little raisins.  Like most dubbels Ive rated, the aroma isnt terribly strong, but it is quite nice.  Flavor is much more pronounced, with lots of yeast and toffee malts and raisins, and the blunted dusty powdered sugar is also a bit stronger than the aroma.  This probably is one of the more bitter dubbels, which might not really be saying much.  There may or may not have been a tiny bit of grassy hops--I thought so but I could be making it up.  Dry finish, which I wasnt really expecting after the the creamy mouthfeel.  Medium bodied, mod-high carbonation.  The head lasted me til the end, so I dunno what cab is talking about.

Caramel and a surprising waft of Burton sulphur in the nose make me want to plunge right in. Sweet toffeeish maltiness balanced with some sourish, chocolate yoghurt notes. A distinctly hoppy, Orval-like dryness also. Yes, thats right, sweet, sour AND bitter. And wickedly drinkable. Was saving a Rochefort 10 to initiate me into the 100 club, but this is more than worthy of the honour. A very sexy Dubbel. (Re-rate, 22/01/08) Was expecting to have to down-rate this slightly, but not a bit of it. Aroma and general yeastiness sourish, darkly fruity and slightly biting. A ringer for Westies 8 and 12. Sourish chocolate-smooth nuttiness, wholemeal, robust hop bitterness... and a lingering waft of freshbread in the aftertaste. Still top 10 material. (Another re-rate) Cannot be contained by karmeliet chalice. Blossoming yellow-beige over mahogany; nose noble, blood, choc yoghurt, hazelnut, biting yeastines like Westy. Poetically noseworthy with a complexity of bubblegum, cherry, alcohol, banana.Wincing, almost menthol hops and CO2 if you over-inhale. And you must. Mmm. 9. Flavour opens with blood, nuts, chocolate, freshly risen bread, hop cheesecake, nuts again, marzipan. Well integrated,very shrubby Germanic hop. Theres a hairs breadth between this and Westy 8, and either could edge it on its day. Top 10 every time. 
25/04/12. Banana, nail polish remover, marzipan aroma. Erm.....tastes a little bit like Batemans? Aniseed and Nutella on wholemeal toast, deep cherry stone, almost Kriek.

550,"2006-08-01",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2007 My Westmalle Dubbel sampling was long overdue.  It should have been one of the first beers I ever had; the typified brew whose purpose is to proselytize the pagan and strengthen the weak.  The beer community recognizes it as a necessary benchmark for the aspiring drinker.  With all the praise and advice focused on the Westmalle Dubbel and its close cousin the Trippel I made a point to pick up a bottle and schedule it into my busy school life.  Almost a year passed, during which the little maroon bottle had fallen into a bad crowd and passed from one cheap six pack case to another, camouflaged in the decorative design of vastly inferior beers.  Finally I picked it out one day on a whim, and off it went into the refrigerator to prepare for its big day.  Another month passed, one of complete sobriety.  My brain had wedged itself into my Japanese textbook, thinking of nothing else but the cryptic and arcane squiggles emanating from that peculiar island in the East.  When break time came there was the Dubbel, worn and tired after so many rejections, but proudly awaiting its consumption.  The wait was worth it.  The pour was a sincerely relaxing moment.  I watched the thick and bubbly liquid slide into my glass, curling over itself until it settled into its natural coffee and cream colored hue, and there it sat, completely stoic and saturnine.  Its modesty belied an active diffusion of scents.  A refreshingly unique blend of mashed apples, hops, malts, lemon sprits and peat flowed into the air, beckoning a taste.  I obliged, and on the first sip detected an oral aroma and texture before any flavors.  It was fizzy and fresh like a sparkling water, flowering with aromatics that reminded me of a good, simple Mirepoix.  Beyond that, the whole experience of drinking Westmalle Dubbel was not entirely unlike licking a wicker basket.  It was raspy, dry and a very hopsy, with a slick of sassafras to soothe the blistered palate.  This fibrous and woody quality eases with warmth, but new flavors fail to materialize.  Westmalle Dubbel is a fine beer with a duality common in the very vast and expansive world of Belgian beers; its not necessarily all peaches and cream, so to speak.  The painful quality is something of a trend that attracts and excites many beer drinkers.  What better then to tantalize the aspiring beer maven then something representative of a wider sample?","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

550,"2006-06-05",3.9,"From a relatively fresh bottle in May 06.

Pours a dark brown with red -brown highlights and a robust tan head. The aroma is apple cider, apricots, and brown sugar. The flavor is highly refined - rather than being in-your-face, it carries warm roasted malts, laced with mild plum sweetness, into a balanced hop-dominated finish in which the bitter flavors mingle with tendrils of residual sweetness.  Plenty of pepper and spice on the tongue, but pepper and spice that are there for you to seek and out savor, rather than spices that impose their presense on you. I admit to tasting hints of old-school diet pepsi, the quite dry kind with a bit of bitterness in the artificial sweetener, but even this isnt an altogether bad thing, though I cant explain precisely why not. 
The beer is extremely drinkable, aided by the ample carbonation and relatively light mouthfeel that come without sacrificing quality or even - if one looks hard enough - complexity.

I can pick out several different flavors including candy-ish roasted malt and dark fruit, against a background of mild spicy hops.

550,"2006-03-07",3.8,"0.33l bottle, Westmalle Trappist glass, at Tolkiens House, Zagreb The bartender claimed that this was the best beer he ever had, and the scores here would pretty much confirm it, best Trappist Dubbel. And I agree (not the best beer ever part, the best Abbey Dubbel one), but Ill come to that later. It poured a very nice very-dark-nearly-black colour. Small thick tan head that went away at a medium pace. The nose... is a damn void, and a huge disappointment. It wasnt even too cold. And it didnt show up as it warmed. Surprising, seeing the big marks in that department in the other reviews. Ah, well. Only some faint acidity/deep malt here. The taste is very pleasant. Not really typical, though (not that sweet). A bit mild, but lovely maltiness, countered by the pleasant Belgian-style acidity, some yeast, weak fruitiness. Weak but pleasant chewy hopiness that goes into the aftertaste. A great quaffer, no doubt about it. Ill try another, just to see if I was wrong about the aroma.","Split / Zagreb, CROATIA","Marko"

Pours a deep translucent copper with one finger head and a sizeable amount of carbonation.

Smell is a complex bouquet of fruity esters, spices, and couple with an undercurrent of mild malt.

Mouthfeel is much the same as a typical Belgian such as a Chimay, a bubbly thickness which carries itself over the tongue in langorous fashion. Not much effort needed to savor rather than swill. Although this is a good Trappist dubbel, its hard not to compare with other major brands as there is a lack of truly distinctive flavoring present. Seems closest to a Chimay Cenq Cents if Im recalling my Chimays correctly, although I definitely like this one a bit better. Very solid, as my scores reflect. I only sound jaded in my comments as a warning to people who have trouble finding Westmalle in their area; if youve got the usual suspects (Chimay, Ommegang, Orval, etc) this one may not be worth going too far out of your way to acquire.","Austin, Texas, USA","julrey"

Finally we meet! What a pretty head it has! An elevated outer crust, an even mantle then a bulbous core erupting with activity caused from the trappist logo below. The source of this shows up as a blood ruby color up to the light and without it looks nearly backstrap molasses black.  All this goodness persists and clings to my glass like a baby does its blanket. Upon getting up close and personal, I find it has a complex smell covering things such as bananas, yeast, raisin, toasted sesame seeds and a pimento note as well. Avoiding beating around the bush, I just decided to grab it and drink it. Lots of zesty carbonation, light alcohol burn, some hop bitterness and acidic yeast bite. Quite a punch! I think I offended it. Either way, its balanced, full bodied, not too sweet. Ill give it time to vent and breath a little more... Ok, back to the beer.

Poured bubbly amber-brown with some yeasties, a light tan creamy head.  Aroma of apples and other tree fruits, hops, some mild brown sugar roast malt (fairly sweet).  Taste follows the roast/apple nose, but theres bitterness here too - some hops and almost crushed appleseed astringency.  Mouthfeel is quite sweet/bitter balanced for an abbey dubbel, a tad thin, but very nice.

Juicy raisins in the mouth, lightly sweet - moving into chalky; becoming quite dry with noticeable but ill-defined bitterness that leads into a lingering licorice finish. It is a beer of some character - providing touches of earthy life that give it  more interest than blander, easier drinking filtered beers - however it fails to come together in harmony and didnt lift my spirit or give me much pleasure beyond examining the individual parts. So - this is a mildly interesting beer of minor character but without any outstanding features.","ENGLAND","Scarborough"

Flavor is very dry up front, I was expecting sweeter from the aroma.  Smooth flavor profile- malt, black cherry, alcohol, fruity, yeasty.

550,"2005-09-02",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 6, 2005 This was the fourth beer of a shared tasting, so a dulled palate may partially explain this rating. However, Im surprised at how underwhelming this seemed. It looked fantastic: teak colour with a towering pillowy head that lasted  well. However, it took a lot of swirling to release the aroma, which seemed very subtle for the 7% abv. First impression was of grape juice, then some unexpected tangy grapefruit notes and a softer melony fruitiness. Nothing wrong with the aroma but it was hard work drawing it out. The palate seemed a fraction thin for the style. The flavour again showed grape juice, with dark bready malts. Quite quenching, with a citric tang in a fairly spiritous finish. May have to revisit this one. (330ml bottle shared with Aarleks, IBS, Perth)","Blue Mountains, AUSTRALIA","highlandlad"

This bottle was much more alive in the mouth: Dark bread comes in late with a meatiness and lots of medicinal flavours, hot overtones, and some golden syrup after a long wait but still a little thin.I must say I was really dissapointed with this one. It simply didnt deliver on any of the fronts apart from looks.

550,"2005-08-31",4.6,"Finally, my first Westmalle Dubbel and a two-year old at that. I was banking on an excellent beer and it certainly delivered. A lovely choice to bring me into the 400. Tasted from the bottle and poured into a chalice at just below room temperature. Opaque chocolate brown body with a tinge of orange in the lights. Head formed from the pour, a good inch thick, dense, rocky beige crown that lasted the length and left an abundance of lace down the glass. Deep, rich and inviting dark chocolate, raisins, prunes and red wine aroma, spicy dry and even a little earthy with a hint of grassy hops. The aroma continued to waft for the length and helped amplify the extremely tasty palate. Similarly rich and dry in the mouth, quite malty and earthy, the body was lighter than expected but made up for by the generous flavour. Wine-like, spicy and a little zesty, it seemed to evolve with each sip. Had a degree of tartness in the back which blended with resinous and herbal, bitter hops and malt before a long, dry and malty swallow. Lovely balance of malt and hops with no hint of the ABV, it was simply as smooth as silk and made for the ideal sipping beer, especially for the unpredictably cold Aussie winter it is right now. Yet another wonderful Trappist beer, I fail to imagine my life without those hardworking monks and their passion for the good ale. Absolutely wonderful!!!

The flavor is smooth and dominated by caramely malts but also has nice undertones of fruits and a tiny bit of yeast.  It really is a much ""smoother"" dubbel than many Ive tried and it has a nice woody nutty finish.  I personally found it very enjoyable as I dont always like something too aggressive tasting.

November 2004. Ruby brown body with an average tan head. Sweet malty aroma, some dark sugars (brown sugar, candi sugar?). Sweet malty flavour with pleasant touch of sugars again, some vague notes of chocolate. Very nice but seemed simplistic, may need to try this one again though given that it was precided in the evening by an Old Crustacean. Nice palate, I enjoyed this one a lot. 6/3/8/4/18 - 3.9","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

550,"2004-10-31",4.4,"Very nice classic trappist. In Belgium definitely now being underrated. In most Belgian pubs they serve this beer too cold, lets say pils temperatures. Then you get some iron taste in the glas. If served in ambient temps you get the full palate of nice malts and some very nice fruit. This beer must also be served very carefully - do not pour the yeast in the glass (my choice), therefore I think it is a delicate beer - handle with care. On draught this beer is slightly thinner but probably the draught Westmalle is much younger, but still very nice. Cheers","BELGIUM","Goviken"

I saw it everywhere in Holland so I ignored it in favor of the rare stuff at first, but once I tried it I tended to go with it as the first beer of the evening quite often (La Chouffe is another good opening beer).

Okay, the beers calmed down a bit, and now we can judge it more suitably, perhaps...gorgeous garnet hue, nearly violet, deep ruby may be more like it, with a generous layer of foam atop, thick, plentiful, creamy, soupy, a dream to watch dwindle down...
Aroma: like sticking ones face deep down in a nest of ripe late-harvest fruits, and a bit from the vegetable side, too...a cornucopia in the nose, rich in cherries, and berries, grapes, and dates, and more that merely waits in the wings behind these major players...a deep, heady aroma, uplifting, otherwordly, luxurious! Damn, but its well past time to drink, isnt it?
Taste: smooth, mellow, but oh, so much flavor, too, too much going on, too, too delicious, and I dont know where to start, actually, ...a rush of warmth, earthy fruitiness, plump and ripe and ever at home in the mouth. Mouthfeel? To capacity! Spices swim in, too, and envelope the senses, and dart about and add to the general sense of well-being felt everywhere that this brew touches. Another good gulp and I feel it again, this warm, spicy, earthy, deep, magical, tasty, fruity, magnificent....oh-my-goodness, sort of feeling...the malt is a wonderful buttress, and flavor-leader, too, but the hops, are a major contributor,as well, leading me to say, ""screw it all, this is a perfectly integrated blend of all thats great in beer-land, isnt it?""
I have more to drink from this bottle, too, and could more, possibly, be gleaned from the last remaining drops that may color my perceptions before this sampling is done? Did I leave out minor notes of nuts and cocoa and coffee, just a stitch? But the points made already, that this is among a rare subset of sublimity, and is so gorgeous that one is better off encountering it on rare occasions to make the meeting more special every time, I says.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

550,"2004-06-13",3.3,"Ok second Belgian of the night
simple yet nice bottle and labelling.
poured into the chalice this is a very attractive beer ,dark ,murky brown with a medium sized off white head..that dissappears fast.

The aroma though , while nice, is rather on the subdued side for what I have been led to expect from Belgian ales. a small spiciness some malt but nothing much to speak of
The taste while marginally better than the aromas is weak..but what there is is a good balance of the spiciness and honeyish malts.
Its ok on the palate.
Its rather drinkable..but that fact in itself tells a tale..i found this nice but dull. Maybe I got a bad bottle..but this was not exciting as i expected..or the price suggested!","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"

This trappist lies somewhere between a Chimay Red and Ommegang, being slightly less enjoyable than either.  The aroma was quite bold: fig, raisin, apple.

Pours a deep dark mahogany body, and an insanely thick and rocky tan head. The aroma is rather cola like.. Chocolaty, with raisins, and dates, yeasty, and notes of old damp oak. Nice roasty flavor! Long suggestions of brown sugar, Toffee malts, pumpernickel bread, almonds, black pepper, and candied yams baked with brown sugar and charred marshmallows. Noting some suggestions of ripened summer Cherries dipped in chocolate fondue. Plenty of pepper and yeast in the finish very velvety lush mouth-feel.

550,"2004-04-23",4.1,"Dark sludgy brown with rusty, tawny reddish edges, great cap of fluffy firm tan foam ever so tall and present, creepingly settling to an ever present murky skim and finely stitched lace sticks. Aroma is intially soft and ripe of fruits giving a blend of mango, grapes, passion, and pear skins. A nice earthy dusting of dry yeast and bread crusts settles across the top after a bit with ever so present gleams of candied sugars. Taste is plump and a bit overcarbonated which gets in the way for me with every sip, as soon as I begin to get something out of it taste wise, the carbonation wipes it away far to quickly. A bit too sharp for my tastes. Perhaps an aged bottle of a year or more would help as this was bottled 2004. What is there for tastes are some dullish fruity malts in a darker realm of plum, raisin, and dry figs, mixing a bit inbetween some pear and cherry pieces. Slight cocoa and a firm earthy yeasty dryness with just a pinch of spice and walnut skin dryness finish it out. Very nice finish. Body is full with a bit much on the carbonation scale which has a scratchy/chalky-like coat on the way down which sorta blends into the complex drying qualities in the finish after awhile, which I actually liked, so that made up for some of my dissatisfaction in the carbonation dept..

There was a bit of raisin the  mouth as well as a finish that was sweet from the alcohol.  The aroma too had an alcohol component to it as well as a bit of woodiness.

Colour: (Y) gushing to thick yellow-brown head, going down lacey; dark brown, mahogany shine. (O) also slight gushing to thick yellow-brown head, still lacey; very dark amber beer, quite clear at first [4]. Nose: (Y) dark malts, perfumed, alcohol. (O) vinous, malty, walnuts & raisins - a whole fruit-and-nuts cake. Complex with a lot of esters.[8] Taste (Y)Subdued bitter from fine dark malts. Ever so slight brown candi-sugar, raising with warming up. Perfumey, grassy and peppery flavour, increasing in intensity with warming towards unfermented worts. There is a retronasal hopimpression as from English hops. I have a fleeting sub-treshold of diacetyl as well, and of marzipan. (O) Nutty, oxydised flavour - a bit wild-mushroom flavour. Oxydised malt too, a bit too much roasted in character [7] Mouthfeel: (Y) well-bodied, very highly saturated. (O) Alcohol-burn, quite full-bodied. [4] Aftertaste: (Y) faint liquorice, more with warming up, slight bittering effect. (O) long prolonging of the former tastes [4] Overall: (Y) This is the surprise. This beer is actually BETTER than I remember it. Trappist ales rule indeed. (O) Somewhere the taste of the old beer derails on the overly roasted malts, whilst the nice madeirisation in the nose was promessing better.

550,"2003-03-09",4.0,"[RE-RATE] I actually had to re-rate this beer because the first time I tried, the aroma and the flavour was dominated by a sort of chemical, artifical taste (probably the bottle wasn't stored in the right way). Now I've finally drunk it on tap and there were a BIG difference. Bloody red colour. The head is big, lasting, very creamy. Chocolate, raisins and hazelnut in the aroma. Very delicate flavour, initially fruity with traces of raspberry, raisins and banana; then it becomes sweeter (chocolate and caramel) with a touch of sourness. The finish is balanced between sweet notes (hazelnut and almonds) and a light hoppy bitterness. Very good beer, perfectly balanced, pleasant and complex.","Como, ITALY","Voivod"

550,"2003-03-07",3.9,"Well, I think it would only be reduntant to further express how great the head on this beer is, although I think this is one of the most characterizing aspects the beer has. The 2% ABV difference here versus the tripel makes a HUGE difference. Every little sweet toasty aspect of the malt is present in the flavor whereas the tripel manages to cover up half of the flavor - the yeast here also seems a lot clearer: less generic bubblegummy Belgian yeastiness, more ditinct fruity character and balance. Very nice.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

Dark reddish brown with large off-white head.  Malt with bitter finish.  Fizzy/bubbly/tingly.  A little bit more complex and more interesting as it warms, with hints of coffee and a little tannin sneaking in.  Good but there are much better Belgian dubbels, and some great American copies, at a fraction of the price.  If Unibroue decided to make a dubbel it would blow this away.  Ommegang strong ale does, and it is a fraction of the price.  Good thing I bought a case of Rochefort 10 at the same time ... on average between the two I am delighted.  ... OK ... rerate second half of bottle after it has warmed up.  Cellar temp is much too cold this week.

The color is very attractive: a red rust/dark copper color.  The aroma is quiet malty.  I found the beer to be seemingly bitter, malty, and slightly yeasty.

The aroma reminded me of lemon zests (rinds), and almost a odd cleanser-like (pine-sol) smell. Very smooth considering how bubbly it is. The taste is very subdued, with subtle hints of citrus (orange, lemon, tangerine?), spices and a root beer aftertaste. Toward the finish a bitter-sweet taste that is reminiscent of hops evolves. Different, and good. Possibly my favorite trappist, and far superior to its Westmalle Trippel cousin.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"

Thick  beige head.  The aroma instantly reminded of honeydew melon.  Extremely smooth, especially in consideration of the carbonation.  Subtle, mellow taste includes melon and orange-rind.

noticeable in the aroma as it is in the flavor.
Dark ruby-red tinted brown.  <P> Years later, an update, and how interesting how things have stayed the same: my main note from the new fresh tasting is that this beer is exquisitely balanced.  The sweetish almost nutty malt flavors mingle with a lightly hopped dry finish, all the while swimming with the lightest phenols (banana) and no alcohol presence whatsoever.  Maybe its not distinctive, but its a great beer that does not draw attention to itself.  I'm lowering my numbers from 4.8 only because I think the original score was a tad too high, not because my opinion of it has dropped.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
