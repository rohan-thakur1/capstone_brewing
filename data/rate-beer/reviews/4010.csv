4010,"2015-10-17",3.6,"0,75l bottle shared by mmahut at Bratislava RB Tasting, big big thanks for this one. black color, small coffee-colored head. smells yeasty, grassy, light currant, a bit underwhelming smell. full body, soft carbonation, slick mouthfeel. tastes currant notes, some sweetness, light roasty, caramel, some grapes, very lightly bitterness form the hops. finishes with some caramel and currant notes. decent stuff, but a bit underwhelming. no hops left which is OK with the barrelaging, but unfortunatly no real roast notes to speak of, rather sweetish thing. I was hoping for more, but maybe not in the prime.","Vienna, AUSTRIA","Werckmeister"

Dark brown body, with a moderate, creamy, beige head.
Aoma of smooth roast, grapefruit, moderate barrel notes.
Tastes of roast, dark chocolate, grapefruit, orange, some pine, barrel notes, some alcohol burn.
Medium, slick mouthfeel, with an average carbonation.
Finishes roasty, medium bitter, a bit alcohol warming, a bit zesty, a bit fruity.

Nice one, but I was expecting a bit more. Pretty smooth and well balanced, but not really complex. Nice sipper after all.","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"
