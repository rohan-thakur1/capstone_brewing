My second pour was a local with a delayed effect. While it starts somewhat low key it soon ramps up the intensity. I think one pint is enough for an afternoon. If it shows up in bottles or on tap locally maybe Ill revisit it.

Aroma / Appearance - The beer comes out with a nice gradient that transitions from black to light red as it gets closer to the top. Hints of idle carbonation escape from time to time. Carmel, chocolate, red vines, and a bittersweet texture tease the nose. This is like smelling the concession stand at a movie theater.

Flavor / Palate - Bubbly caramel rises up and over the tongue. Lifting the senses it carries along anise and bitter chocolate. The inside of a cream filled chocolate donut caps a beer that is good from start to finish. Once again NABC hits it out of the park.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
2601,"2012-01-27",4.1,"Tap (2012 Version - 6.4% alcohol).   Chocolate and light molasses malt - very nice.  Dark chestnut brown color with moderate head and nice lacing.  Lightly sweet molasses and chocolate malt flavor with a lightly bitter herbal hops finish.    This is some great stuff - a bit light but very tasty.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"

2601,"2008-04-11",4.5,"On tap at New Albanian. Poured dark brown, with a tan head. Spicy, malty nose. Flavor was pumpkin pie spice, sweet malt and alcohol. Finish was refreshing with warm alcohol notes. Billed as a ""Colonial Strong Ale"" this was a wonderful brew--flavorful, refreshing, yet powerful. Im glad someone else was driving!","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","allfreej"

2601,"2006-02-16",3.9,"Draft.  Pours a dark brown with a thick tan head.  Excellent aroma of molasses, oak.  The flavor was excellent.  A little sweetness, added to a little malt, with a clean taste.  If this is how the Colonials drank, life then would be great!","Clarksville, Indiana, USA","antzman"
2601,"2006-02-09",4.2,"Draft - deep brown/amber body with a creamy beige head of about one-fingers depth.  Huge fruity nose - I could just sit and smell this one, but of course then Id miss the fun!  Absolutely delicious flavor!  My first thought upon tasting it was that it is Imperial Rogue Dead Guy - fruity and sweet and just plain yummy!  Keep em coming Jessie!","New Albany, Indiana, USA","smoosh"
2601,"2006-02-04",4.1,"Draft: Midnight mahogany. Compact dirty-white head. Attractively busy aroma of leathery yeast, butter, pinewood, honey, and spruce tips. Very clean oak scents. Chewy body and densely carbonated. Initially earthy with a snappy blend of yeast and barky malt richness. Rich fruitcake notions flourish alongside bright notes of evergreen and spruce. Exuberant balance. Touch of depth-lending molasses astringency, but its fairly faint in flavor. Fresh oak and woody hops stiffen the vibrant array of berry esters and keep the bodys wetness at bay. Cleanly attenuated, but with just enough scratchy yeast to complement the fruitiness. Oak lends a quiet mustiness which effectively displaces just enough sweetness late in the flavor. Finishes chewy with honey-drizzled fruitcake suggestions, as fresh-tasting woody hop burps follow suit. A phenomenal session beer that would make ol Ben mighty proud.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
