Appearance - golden with bubbles that tell me it is not over carbonated but fresh. 
Nose - citrus and pale malt. Perhaps some honey but its faint.
Taste - good malt base yhe some good citrus bitterness. 
Palate - light to medium bodied with a dry zingy texture that lasts thriygh to the finish. Loads of enduring bitterness. Were in pilsner territory.
