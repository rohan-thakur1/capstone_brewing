2363,"2016-08-29",3.7,"Draught at the African Lounge, 8/19/16.Its cool to see this still in existence! Id always wanted to try this back in the day, but somehow never did. This was quite a iconic beer and I can see why. Its hazy, with a soft, malty-sweet yet well-attenuated texture that a lot of American beers back then didnt have. In addition, its got tons of fruity, lightly juicy hops that place more emphasis on the aromatic and flavor compounds than they do the bitterness. As well, though its amber in color, its very different from the grainy, iced tea-flavored, monotonous malt creations that dominate the amber ale style. Almost like an unintentional precursor to the New Enlgand IPA and sure enough, though its got nowhere near the hop character, its not THAT far off from something like Bissell Bucolia, which is quite high praise, at least in my opinion.Anyways, fun beer, good piece of history and glad to have finally tried it.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2363,"2012-08-21",3.9,"Exceptional amber ale, one of the best Ive ever had. The addition of the hops, which are perfectly mixed in, give this beer an awesome dimension unmatched by other beers of the same style. A murky caramel body with a thin cream head and great lacing gives off a light, bready aroma. A fruity sweet taste hits you first that immediately gives way to the malty body with the hops starting to make an appearance. This all culminates in a chocolate caramel finish that sticks around for awhile and settles in softly and beautifully. Fantastic beer, this its one to be sought after.","","Msavage235"

2363,"2012-08-01",4.6,"UPDATED: SEP 16, 2012 This is one of the best on draft beers Ive ever tasted. You truly havent experienced WA until youve tasted Mac and jacks African Amber. ""This beer erupts with a floral, hoppy taste, followed by a well rounded malty middle, finishing with a nicely organic hop flavor.""  I also recommend attending the Brewery tour in Redmond, youll get a free cup of beer. Also, I have noticed that the taste can vary from bar to bar. Its on draft and lots can happen to the beer the longer the distance it is traveled and the longer its kept.

This beer has become something of an institution of this modern third wave craft brewing epoch in the Pacific Northwest. You can get it just about anywhere, and its kind of like the way both the public and musicians alike enjoyed Kind of Blue when it came out--newbs and veteran beer lovers alike can both enjoy this beer. Which means you can get it anywhere. Which means it isnt always fresh or well cared for. Which means its ubiquity and the difficulty of getting a *good* pint of it has created something of a backlash of apathy about it. And thats too bad. Because this beer really is a good one.
Pours seriously murky and grainy dark caramelly amber with a nice dense, slightly moussy off-white head. Gorgeous woody, herbal hoppy nose.
One of the great things about this beer for sure is the mouthfeel. Rich and creamy right from the attack, though not at all heavy, certainly not sticky. Maybe a bit grainy. Nicely balanced carb. Its got that instant subcortical rush of pleasure that comes with a perfectly manifested, impeccably modulated mid-thick body--the kind that makes you think to yourself ""whatever I was doing all day, whether I am celebrating it or trying to forget about it, its over now, because now I am drinking beer."" This beer just instantly relaxes you, long before any hint of the booze hits your system (and there really isnt that much of that, relatively speaking).
The flavors are notoriously sweet, even for an amber. Not compared to, say, an eisbock or a fruit beer, for sure. But within the nuttiness, toastiness, and woodiness on the mid-palate, theres a caramelly malt sweetness thats not quite what youd call pronounced, but its very pleasing and it leavens the huskiness and the hops. Anyone, just about, can drink this beer. The hops get particularly woody at the finish. Its hard to call any amber a tour de force, and Ive had batches of this that were too sweet, and certainly too many pints of it in lousy shape when I was in places that had nothing else palatable. But fresh from the brewery, or well-loved in a nice place, this beer is the king of the hill looking over its kill within the world of amber ales. Its well worth the drive down to the end of 520 to check out the lads at work and get a growler of this one fresh from the teat. They really know what theyre doing.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

2363,"2007-10-27",3.7,"On tap at Trackside Pizza. Mac & Jacks African Amber was delivered to the table. It was a brilliant pumpkin-orange, with a gold aura. The head was thick ivory in color, and hung around. The lacing was good, as was the lively carbonation. The nose was primarily fruity and floral.

The ale felt good in the mouthpresent, solid. The flavor is primarily biscuity and nutty, with some raisin. There is a faint grapefruit flavor that makes itself known. Also, light floral and grassy notes. It reminds me less of other ambers I have had and more of a hybrid of a brown ale and an India pale ale. It definitely is an ale of its own and I wouldnt want it any other way.

Mac & Jacks African Amber is only available by the keg, which is a good excuse to make more trips to Trackside.

The pizza I had to accompany the Mac & Jacks was the B&O, minus the mushrooms. That meant a medium crust with a slightly sweet, slightly tangy tomato sauce, with generous portions of mozzarella cheese, black olives, pepperoni, and sausage.

Mild aroma of honey, smokey caramel, floral violet petals, and a touch of sprucey hops.  Medium bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel.

Amongst the sticky caramel melanoidans, a distant pine forest burns, a smidgen of smokiness detectable.  Lots of brash, unapologetic white pine boughs create a firm hop bite on the front of the palate, but it thins in flavor at the finish while the body remains heavy.  Nothing great, but its still nice to observe such great support for the local brewers, seeing how this was popularly offered alongside bud light pretty much everywhere.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Recently revisited - spicier than what I remember, added an edge that detracted from the sweet malt backbone.

Resampled again 6/9/2007 - Had it fresh out of a growler from the brewery. It was a very fresh batch and one that really embodied every great thing about this drink. Heavy, rich, roasted barley dominated well with some sweet molasses notes. Very creamy and smooth.

8/4/2007 - The more I drink this the more I realize how inconsistent it can be from batch to batch. Get the right one and its among the best, get the wrong and youll find it too thin or overhopped or overspiced. Ill keep my rating where it is for the finest example ive tried.

8/19/2007 - Another growler downed, this time a little thinner with a stronger caramel cereal malt base. a less impressive variant of a great drink. I estimate by this rating that I have drank over five gallons of this the past 12 months.

01/17/2008 - Another gallon down, another coming up this weekend.... Like the new Retail shop section of the brewery - where can I get one of those signs?

2363,"2006-01-13",4.0,"Unfiltered, for sure, as it pours opaquely, a rich russet, far darker than Id expect of an amber, light orange at the foot and along the sides. The head is puffy, bone-white, a solid half inch and holds well. Very attractive glass of brew!

Nose is lightly laced with hops and amped up with sweet malt. Slightly candyish, and aplomb with fruit, soft citrus, grapefruit and tangerine, orange rind and lemon zest. Exceptionally inviting!

Clean entry on the palate, but loaded with flavor, urging the lips to meet the cup again, for a deeper examination. Hangs full in the mouth, then floods the gates with deliciousness, same flavors found in the aroma spilling out.

Body is medium, mouthfeel is smooth, while tangy and tasty. Finish is lighter than I normally prefer, but seems just right for the style. I understand why ambers are favorites among many people and the one that hits the right medium can became ""the best beer in the world!"" to those folks. Theres a lot of them, and I can see why this one can easily be Washingtons answer to New Belgiums Fat Tire, Anderson Valley Boont Amber, and so many others.

What strikes me about this beer is its impressive balance between quality and accessibility. Not only is it quite a decent effort in a usually-not-so-impressive category, but also every non-beer-geek friend Ive recommended this to has loved it.  

March 14, 2007: 
Sometimes I can be a bit dismissive of this hometown favorite, in favor of masterful amber ales such as Drakes Expedition.  I think that part of the problem is that I rarely order it anywhere that actually knows how to properly serve a beer. Rather, it tends to be a fallback option at local eateries when nothing exciting is available. Thus when I get it, I tend to get it stale, overcarbonated, and too cold.  But lately Ive been drinking these at a favorite neighborhood restaurant (Piccolo in Maple Leaf), and as poured there, fresh and served at the proper temperature. its truly an outstanding beer. Im bumping my ratings up accordingly.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

It has quite a spicy aroma for an amber , with notes of citrus and maltiness.

This is a solid not-to-offend-anyone ale, that was a hit for our thanksgiving festivities.  The aroma is sour, with some decent English malts.

Citrus, brown sugar, toasty, caramely aroma.  Flavor was quite unusual for an amber ale, with rather intense citrus (lemon, orange) dominating the profile with little associated bitterness.

Appearance is a pleasant hazy orange-amber; head is a bit disappointing but with lingering lacy traces.  Aroma is almost undetectable--what nose there is can be said to be slightly malty and fruity.  The flavor is decidedly malty, with medium hop presence providing balance...carbonation is also a bit on the light side...It finishes quite clean, with just a hint of lingering malt sweetness.  Dont get me wrong--I drink this ale periodically when out-and-about in Pugetland drinking emporiums, but I think perhaps this brews reputation is built upon its tap-only availability and exotic name and logo.

Its creamy consistency and amazing mix of sweet flavours coupled with just the right amount of hops makes this beer the #1 ale to have peirced my lips.  Would somebody please tell these folks to bottle this hidden gem.  I want to thank the city of Seattle for granting me the opportunity to become acquainted with this delight.","Helena, Montana, USA","rjjense99"
2363,"2001-12-13",5.0,"Surprisingly fruity (orange and lemon overtones) and creamy texture.  Stands on its own merits.  Tasted twice.  Shame that it isnt available outside of the Pacific Northwest.","USA","brandman99"
2363,"2001-11-24",4.9,"Simply the best.  Not only does this beer smell great, look great, and taste great, but it is also very potent.  I believe the Alcohol Content is around 8%, but Im not entirely sure, all I know is it gets the job done.  If youre ever in Seattle, this is a must have!","Seattle, Washington, USA","FatMorbo99"
2363,"2001-09-19",3.6,"This a very good beer.  Very creamy, lasting head with a definate late addition hop flavor and amroma.  With light to medium carbonation and a wonderful amber color, its perfect when lagers and blondes are not enough and a stout or porter is to much.

Ive had it many times, but I must admit that it is a tad over rated.  Here in Seattle its one of the newest in beers, and because of that current opinion is probably higher then it deserves.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ntempleton"

2363,"2001-06-19",4.5,"This beer alone makes moving to the Northwest completely worth it.  It has a great balanced flavor, not too hoppy to overwhelm you.  They dont bottle so they stay small and non-commercial.  They basically brew out of a big, old garage.  It isnt pretty but the brewers are so cool and the beer is amazing. Its the best damn thing about Seattle!","Seattle, Washington, USA","Indy99"
2363,"2001-04-28",4.5,"This is a great beer (unfortunately it is not in a bottle) - Hazy dark copper in color-- this beer explodes with citrusy hops for flavor(cascades? dry hopped.....oh yeah probably with cascades yet provides a great malt back-bone.) scrumptious bitter bite lingers on in the finish making you desire more. And by the way this beer secretly delivers a high alcholic punch.  three pints and you are doing fine my friends !!!","Kenmore, Washington, USA","Stove Top"
2363,"2001-04-02",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2007 Finally, the long-awaited re-rate of African Amber!  Cloudy, amber, nice thick head.  Complex malt nose - toasty, woody, caramelly, like a really nice multigrain bread.  The palate is similar, with toasty up front, lots of earthiness and a pleasurable amount of hop bitterness.  Well-made amber.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
2363,"2001-04-01",5.0,"One of the Big Three from Seattle, the other two being Bhagwans Best IPA and Hales Pale Ale.  Hands down the best amber ale on the planet. Amazingly creamy (no doubt because it is unpasteuzized) and sweet, with a masterful hop balance. It will be a great day when this beer is bottled for store sales.  As it is, if you are Washington State, priority number one should be finding this beer on tap.  The best kept secret in brewing, and one of the ten best in the world.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
