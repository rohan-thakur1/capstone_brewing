329,"2014-03-30",4.3,"Draught at EBF, 3/22/14Favorite beer of the fest and definitely made me rethink my position on Angels Share. Previously, while I enjoyed the beer (we¬íre talkin batch 1, way back in 2006, I believe?), I was a little thrown off by the candied sweetness and slight alcohol heat. That was a young batch. I still gave it a 3.8. Now take that, and add to it all of the improvements that Tomme¬ís made over the years, add some age (and resulting dryness), pick the very best barrels, blend. Hard to imagine it could be anything less than amazing. And in my book, it certainly delivered on that.Sweetness is immediately tempered by vinousness; prunes, raisins, black currant-like notes. Chewy, but not syrupy or worty. While some other thought it was overly bourbony, I am usually pretty sensitive to that and didnt get it at all. Certainly a sipper, and yes, there¬ís going to be some alcohol, but I thought it was pretty well-concealed. Brandy-like sweetness, wood tannins, raisin-like sweetness, and bourbon complexities all melded perfectly. Nice carbonation level, as well. Too many of these things have ultra low levels and suffer because of it. This still has an engaging carbonation that helps mask some of its burly size.Really one of the best barleywines out there (not that that¬ís saying much). Very unique and as always, I feel very lucky to have tried it.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Some may say the whole ""BA"" thing is a fad, but here¬ís a brewery which definitely knows how to do it right. An interesting, almost overwhelming taste experience. Unique and delicious. Sip slowly.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"
329,"2012-07-18",4.1,"375 ml bottle from moejuck- thanks a ton, Joe! Pours a dark, hazy cola brown with almost no head- settles flat. Aroma of brown sugar, caramel malts, raisins, figs, dates, toffee candy, cola, oak, and a brandy-like boozy note. Flavor of tons of grapes, plums, brown sugar, caramel, oak, and a rich wine character, kind of like a Port or Bordeaux. More tartness in the flavor than the nose, while the nose has a ton of sweetness; both do, really. Medium-bodied, with low carbonation. Maybe a little too tart- I liked that dimension but it dominates the palate after the initial awesome complexity. Really hard beer to describe. Fun to drink.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

A: Dark brown with decent sized head and lacing.

S: Roasted malt, bourbon, brandy, alcohol, raisins and/or dark fruits. There¬ís a whole lot going on here. Amazingly complex. If there wasn¬ít such a prominent alcohol aroma, it would have achieved the highest score.

329,"2012-03-01",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 2/23/2011.  Poured from a 300 mL bottle into a pint glass.

The pour is molasses brown, with a small cocoa colored head. With the ABV what it is, I am not surprised at the quick disappearance of the head or lack of lace.

The aroma has some tart cherry notes. Molasses, caramel, and brown sugar all provide a sweet aspect to the aroma, and some roasted malt, vanilla, oak, and dark fruits add some serious depth.

Even knowing how sweet this is going to be, I am still turned off by how overwhelming the sweetness actually is. Brown sugar and molasses really overpower the medium roasted malt. Some plums, brandy, vanilla and oak add complexity, but unfortunately add to the sweetness as well. A bit of oak later on helps a bit toward the end. This is clearly a dessert beer.

This full bodied strong ale starts off sweet and chewy and finishes a little bit dry from the oak. Light to medium carbonation. A bit of heat is apparent in a warming sensation that hits my stomach. 

I enjoyed the small glass I had and thought it was very well-crafted, but I would not really be able to handle much more of this outside of a dessert setting.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Pours an extremely thick dark brown, almost looks like molasses, with a thin tan head that slowly recedes to a thin collar of lace.  The nose is super intense sweet raisin with tons of brown sugar, slightly oxidized port wine, actually quite vinous and fruity, balsamic, and some underlying tartness that becomes more apparent as the beer warms.  The sourness is much more present on the flavor, showing with tart lemon and balsamic vinegar, but all of the raisin vinous fruit, brown sugar, caramel, and toffee flavors are in the background, along with the distinct note of black peppercorn.  The body is very thick and somewhat syrupy with a good amount of tannin, light, but fizzy carbonation, and a very long finish that starts off with the sour notes and moves through the gamut of vinous and malty caramel flavors as well.

Pours a dark, nearly night black with a thin tan head. Spoiler: This is my favorite part of the beer. It¬ís all downhill from here.

Sweet booziness, caramel, and buttery popcorn. Grape brandy.
I don¬ít want to dwell too much on this, so I¬íll make it quick: tastes of sour white grapes, plums, molasses, booze, and a brandy-like sweetness runs through it (to little effect). As it warms, I can¬ít get through the permeating, unbalanced soured grape / vinous flavor. This is not good. 

Surprisingly light and not as rich or thick as I expected. Tannic finish. Somewhat hot. 

I came here to commiserate, but it looks like I may be alone here in finding this rather unbalanced, overly grapey, and not as rich as I expected, given a recent tasting of Deliverance (which was far superior, IMHO, but still just okay). Possibly an off bottle - will update if tried again.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

Thin fizzy half finger mocha colored head that immediately fades into a thin lasting ring. No lacing whatsoever.

The nose on this beer is absolutely incredible! Lots of earthy oak notes accomanied by hints of vanilla, bourbon, brandy, roasted malt and dark fruit. Lately, a lot of BA age beers I¬íve had smell and taste like alcohol bombs but this smells incredibly complex and well balanced.

Chewy medium body that has all the complexity and balance that the nose suggested. There is plenty of heat and sweet alcohol from the high ABV and barrels but this is countered by a slightly smokey roasted malt body. Hints of chocolate and toast as well as some dark fruit notes, especially grape and dark berries. Vinous with plenty of bourbon flavor and maybe some brandy too accompanied by subtle vanilla flavor from the barrel aging. Surprisingly the ABV is well masked making this pretty quaffable een though there is some nice warmth in the finish.

I found the normal bourbon version to be a bit dominated by bourbon, but the Grand Cru is smooth and the bourbon barrel-aging blends very well.  This beer has a ton of different flavors bouncing around, though they all manage to fuse into a sweet, complex explosion.  There are notes of brown sugar, molasses, raisins, grapes, cherries, oak, bourbon, caramel, vanilla and chocolate.  The booze is felt but is warming without being harsh.  Mouthfeel is smooth with a good level of carbonation for the beer (another point for this one over some other versions of AS, though that¬ís only a bottle issue, as far as I know).

329,"2010-05-13",3.9,"A solid pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a fat-one-finger thick , lightly cocoa-browned, dark tan colored head.  The beer is a dark brown, with a touch of amber to it around the edges.  The beer remains mostly opaque when held up to the light, but does show some clear, lighter amber-brown hues.  The aroma is a rich mix of brandy, rich browned malt aromatics, toasted caramelized notes, dark fruity prune notes, some spicy alcohol, spicy oak notes, definite rich vanillin character and hazel nut aromatics.  This definitely has hit the spot, this is the first Angel¬ís share since the batch 1 Brandy version; a very well integrated, smooth mix of Barrel notes, dark fruit, vanilla and rich malt.  It reminds me of a decadent, brandy soaked, dark spice cake; it is definitely a desert beer.

The taste is just sweet enough to work well with the spicy barrel character, and rich viscosity.  Flavors of vanilla, dark caramel, molasses, brandy soaked plums and raisins, light cocoa notes and brown sugar crusted nuts work harmoniously up front.  The beer is still a little cold, which tends to accentuate a spicy oak note in the finish as well as some alcohol warming / heat in the finish.  This has a touch of tartness to it somehow; perhaps influenced by the grapes, the barrels and even the alcohol.  The rich malt character is quite decadent, but really isn¬ít too much and somehow manages a certain ¬ìlightness¬î; though this is definitely a sipping beer.  As this warms up it becomes a touch richer, and a bit less spicy and alcoholic in the finish, though this still remains so.  The dominant note here is the malt (though the barrel character is pretty close) with rich brown sugar, a complex nuttiness, smooth toasted malt, browned bread flavors and a really rich caramel character that leans towards buttery, dark toffee.  This has just about a perfect balance between light carbonation and chewy body for a beer like this.  There is even a touch of barrel derived smokiness and saltiness that comes through, to add to the complexity, as the beer warms up.

This is definitely quite nice, after being disappointed in any Angels Share since the first Brandy batch, I am quite happy to be drinking this; though to be fair much of my previous disappointment is due to the phenomenal status of that first bottled batch.  This doesn¬ít quite reach the level of that first batch, as it is a touch hot and not quite as well integrated, but this is a damn fine sipper.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

329,"2010-04-19",3.9,"375ml bottle.  The pour yields an extremely dark and ruddy looking chestnut-mahogany colored body.  A surprisingly staunch head of smooth, mocha tinted foam recedes slowly to a wispy film with a pronounced rim around the edge.  Dense sheeting on the glass breaks apart into minimal, spotty globules that meander slowly back towards the body beneath.  The nose comes across with a faint but sharp twinge of sherry vinegar, a disappointing revelation for sure.  I can feel the rich brown sugar and caramel-toffee trying to reign free, but alas, there¬ís just that little, sharp, alcoholic edge that gets in the way.  Still, notes of hazelnuts, walnuts, maple covered dates, and cocoa are awfully hard to resist.  Flavors are right on par, again based in rich, caramelized sugars, blended dark fruits, and maple glazed nuts.  A little sour mash bourbon twang comes across, while tannic, slightly vingeary grape notes seem a little misplaced.  The palate is perhaps too carbonated, the opposite of what plagued a few recent batches of Angel¬ís Share.  It is also a little too dry, with some of the tannins seemingly thinning it out a bit, and the yeast proving just a bit too hungry.  Overall, it¬ís a damn fine beer, but it is not without flaw, and the bourbon and brandy versions both surpass it with ease.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

329,"2010-03-12",4.4,"Bottle. Opens with a pop. Seems to have carbonation. Pours with a large (about an inch) tan head (more than most any non tap Angel Share, and I have had most vintages fresh) that flattens over a murky deep brown body. Damn. Some strong alcohol legs. Not really lacing, but legs like a sake, mead, ice cider or even hard liquor.  Boozy aroma with a lot of barrel character. Some toffee and sweet bread. Lots of vanilla and boundless complexity. Sweet. Oh wow, big boozy and awesome character. A great Angel¬ís Share. Huge palate crushing flavors that wow you like all the other vintages. This stuff makes you think. Very hot, but dry and tannic. Not even a hint of anything that would make you think cloying (which is impressive). Seems to have a decently low gravity for a beer like this. Warming from the first sip (although it takes about a minute to get their). Duration is still going from the first sip (I am drinking this as I type and it has been about two minutes). Lots of wood, lots of booze and vanilla. Now a second sip: this is really a barrel melange: delicious. I am getting a little hint of grape, but I that might just be the brandy barrels. Lots of toffee.  Rich and elegant. Creamy, almost too lively carbonation (WELCOME BACK BUBBLES!). Neither the alcohol, nor sweetness make this hard to drink. What makes it hard to drink is the sheer assault of decadent flavors and strong (in the nicest of ways for me) barrel flavors that seriously crush your palate. A better beer sipper would be hard to find. There is some alcohol, but it is not fusel. Just a hint of nostril burn coming up from your throat when you sip it. This is a great version of Angel Share, and as always a really special experience for your palate every time you have it.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

How: Boston Extreme Beer Fest 2010.  Night Of The Barrel session.  Two samples
The look: Cloudy dark brown topped by a medium tan head
In long: With the Angel¬ís Share Brandy and Bourbon being so well known I did not take much flavour notes on Grand Cru version.  One thing I can say is that I had the original Angel¬ís Share 2006 brandy on multiple occasions (include 2 bottles by myself) and I had the original Angel¬ís Share 2007 bourbon on multiple occasions (1 bottle by myself).  I also had all subsequent batches of both the brandy/bourbon versions.  The original ones were by all accounts the best ones so far.  So I think I know what various Angel¬ís Share can taste like and how great the best vintages were.  And I truly believe that this Grand Cru version is superior to any vintages of any version of the Angel¬ís Share I¬íve ever had.  I never thought the original batches of Angel¬ís Share had much brandy or bourbon flavours.  We even did a blind tasting with both original releases and we were unable to tell which one was brandy and which one was bourbon.  Yet for some reason with this Grand Cru I picked up BOTH bourbon and brandy notes.  The body is as decadent as the original 2006 release.  The carbonation was perfectly smooth and not a bit lifeless as in some of the recent vintages.  There were fruity notes that I never got from the previous vintages.  More complex than any Angel¬ís Shares I¬íve had.  This might very well be my new favourite decadent American barley wine.  This beer is amazing.  2010 is starting great for Tomme Arthur, a brewer I truly admire, he puts out a masterpiece of a beer and the anti-stalking court order he¬ís filed against me has been completed.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Aromas are a wonderful plethora of barrel elements, wet oak in copious amounts, vanilla, the spirits come through with the slight edge to bourbon over brandy, warming, a touch boozy, tannins, with caramel and toffee malt base beneath, a touch of dried dark fruits giving this the English style barleywine flare. A touch of grape does come through, but small and just adds to the dark fruit feel, a touch of marmalade, light bitterness. Big barrel display blend, smooth. Initial is a fuller bodied beer, palate sticker with caramel and toffee malts, brown sugar, light cocoa, dried fruit, coffee beans, and big barrel cutting through the fog, bourbon and brandy from the wet oak, vanilla tannins, a touch of mellow tannin red wine feel on the far backend, but this is very subtle, and the spirit and sturdy malt base are dominant.

Smooth fruity, port, vanilla, chocolate and caramel. Smooth caramelish and roasted malt finish, mixed with a bit of vanilla wooden notes.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
329,"2010-02-22",4.7,"375 mL bottle purchased at the brewery on release day (February 13, 2010) for $20.  I tried the 2009 brandy barrel Angels Share last night, so I was eager to see how good this might be.  The bottle opens with a considerable pop, more than the one last night.  Pours into tulip glass a dark brown with...wait for it...two full fingers of brown head with great retention.  Yes, it appears to be generously carbonated!  Same excellent aroma (caramel, wood, maple syrup, chocolate, vanilla, and booze), but it¬ís somewhat muted -- could be because of that thick layer of foam that was not there in the much flatter 2009 brandy barrel I had last night ;-)     Flavor is richer and more complex than the normal Angels Share -- the wood and booze (both brandy and bourbon are there) stand out more while the caramel and chocolate are more subdued.  And I almost didn¬ít expect to be able to taste the grapes, but there¬ís a hint in there.  Though the brandy/bourbon flavors are more noticeable, this actually has less ""booze"" in the flavor and finish than the normal Angels Share -- very smooth.  Really, the carbonation is not a big issue for this beer which is a sipper any way.  Though the bottle I had last night was flat, I have to say that the much improved carbonation in this bottle does not really add to the flavor or the overall experience.  $20 is too much for a 375 mL bottle but I do have to say that I was very impressed with this one.

329,"2010-02-22",4.2,"Bottle from the brewery.  Pours a deep caramel brown with a creamy beige head, some light lacing left on the tulip.  Lots of cookie dough with a ton of toffee, caramel, bourbon and booze heat.  Starts very tingly on the palate with good carbonation.  Sweet caramel, toffee, dates and candied apricots on the finish.","San Diego, California, USA","Snojerk321"
329,"2010-02-21",4.4,"375mL bottle purchased from Lost Abbey.  No carbonation.  I showed this to hophead84, who said he has seen 4 bottles opened all with carbonation.  The bottle was chilled, maybe 50F.  Thick body.  Sweet.  Smells fantastic.  Perfect barrel characteristics.  Just needs carbonation.  Delicious.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
329,"2010-02-21",3.6,"375ml bottle brought to my tasting by WeeHeavySD, thanks for the surprise Jon. Rating #12. Dark brown cola pour with a very light head. Vanilla and dark ripe fruits are huge in the aroma, alcohol from the barrel stands out as well. Not nearly as strong as the regular AS though, a little more muted. Flavor was a little lighter on the palate than the regular version as well, a little thin, but the bourbon is a lot more up front, almost like a straight shot, but without the huge alcohol kick. Good stuff, but I like my AS a little thicker and chewy. (1130)","Redlands, by way of Wisconsin,, California, USA","Hophead22"
329,"2010-02-20",4.4,"375ml bottle from Sinners Club, the cork pops off with a loud thwap and the beer pours into the requisite Lost Abbey chalice with a large 2 fingers of lively head consisting of lots of tiny bubbles. Aroma is Brandy, Bourbon, Caramel, Brown Sugar, Oak, Grape Skins and some faded hops. Flavor is caramel, brandy, bourbon, oak, grapes, the tannins from the wood add a nice bitterness that melds with the oak and brandy and bourbon as the alcohol kicks in with a slight burn in the finish. This is quite good.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Rusty"
329,"2010-02-20",4.4,"Bottle.  Pours a deep dark opaque brown with a half finger fizzy tan head that faded into a ring around the glass pretty quick.  The nose is sweet bourbon and brandy, caramel, vanilla and wood.  The taste is vanilla, raisins, sweet brandy, malt and booze.  Medium semi-creamy mouthfeel with so prickly bubbles on the tip of the tongue.  Very good beer!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","Sparky"
329,"2010-02-20",3.8,"NOTB. Pours a murky medium dark brown.  Aroma consists of candied sugars, oak, caramel and strangely maple syrup. Not nearly as good as I expected","Westfield, Massachusetts, USA","dogfish120love"
329,"2010-02-18",4.7,"Bottle from stefanje, thanks so much! Pours a very dark brown with a small beige head.  Aroma has tons of raisins, prunes, caramel, vanilla, toffee, wet oak, and some chocolate.  Flavor is really, really good.  Lots of vanilla and caramel, raisins, dates, dried figs, oak, bourbon, brown sugar, maple syrup.  I drank this right after an 09 brandy AS and this really stood head and shoulders above.  The Lost Abbey guys that I spoke to at the AZ strong beer fest were right, this stuff is insanely good. Wow.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"

huge bourbon bose with a creamy mouthfeel followed by a tangy finish. This is a very nicely done big beer.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
329,"2010-02-17",4.3,"Pours dark brown, dense, awesome legs with an actual head (it has bubbles!) Aroma- Madeira, wood, brown sugar, raisins, cookies, alcohol, really complex. Taste- really similar to a Madeira, roasted malts, toffee, raisins, red grapes, oak, alcohol. Full bodied and smooth. Excellent barrel aged beer.","California, USA","mastabass666"
329,"2010-02-16",4.3,"On tap (?) at Toronado barleywine fest 2010.  The question mark there is due to the fact that I heard this beer didn¬ít exist on tap, but it was definitely Angels Share Grand Cru on the list for this fest.  Maybe they poured it out of bottles behind the scenes - who knows?  Pours very dark brown and more opaque than pretty much anything else there.  A nice one-finger tan head sits on top and lasts a long time.  Amazing aroma: caramel, chocolate, brandy, bourbon, red grapes, and oak.  Flavor is also really excellent, as all Angels Share incarnations are when they¬íre carbonated.  Brandy and bourbon along with cabernet grapes, oak, vanilla, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, chocolate, and mild roast.  So much going on there.  Also a little alcohol.  Fairly full body with a great carbonation level (medium-low) and a little booziness, but not enough to make it a chore to drink.  Nice one, Tomme.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
329,"2010-02-16",4.3,"I was lucky enough to get some of this at the release without needing to open up one of my few purchased bottles.  Thank you for sharing.  Dark brown pour, thin tan head. It has carbonation!  Very rich sweet malt, dark dried fruits (plums, prune, raisin), chewy bread, bourbon, oak, vanilla, molasses, note of grape sweetness.  This is a very complex HUGE barleywine, focused on sweet malt and barrel aging.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
329,"2010-02-15",4.6,"Poured dark amber brown, dark fruits, caramel malts, alcohol, molasses, wood, vanilla, little chocolate, slightly vinious.","Livermore, California, USA","fidel"
329,"2010-02-14",3.5,"2nd rating, happy first 2 ratings come from a bottle I bought yesterday.  I got to take a sip out of Christian¬ís glass at the release but wanted to rate it from a bottle.  Pours brownish black with a thin tan ring.  Nose is sweet rich, and malty.  Taste is sweet, malty, boozy, pretty good but way too much booze, feels like bourbon more than brandy.  I like the concept behind this beer, but I¬ím really not sure if the blended beer does it as well as the original .","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
329,"2010-02-14",4.3,"1st rating on a bottle weeheavysd brought to hophead22¬ís tasting no less..Holy shit was my reaction when Tim popped the cork and it actually popped...Aroma was very sweet, bourbon, vanilla, caramel...Flavor was bourbon, dark chocolate and vanilla..Good carbonation.. My only knock against this beer is its $20 for a 375ml price tag..Thanks Jon.","Riverside, California, USA","DuffManSW"
