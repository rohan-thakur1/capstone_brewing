4562,"2017-01-01",4.3,"Batch 4. Pours a hazy golden yellow from the bottle with bubbly white head that leaves moderate lace. Aroma is loads of funk and acidity with hints of wheat and floral undertones. Taste is the closest thing I have had to a Belgian style lambic from an American brewery, loads of mild funk, a hint of light fruit, oaky must, mild acidity. Wow, this was a big surprise, gonna have to keep an eye out for more of their beer.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"
4562,"2016-11-23",4.0,"750 ml Bottle. Batch 4. The beer is a hazy gold with a fizzy white head of foam that dissipates quickly. Almost no head retention. The aroma has big lactic sourness. Some doughy, bready, funky tartness in the taste. Some moderate herbal notes. Subtle though. Sour and lactic throughout. Lighter in body and medium carbonation. Spritzy mouthfeel.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
4562,"2016-08-31",3.8,"Several oz. pour from a bottle; thanks to falco242. Consumed on 8-30-16. A few months under one year of age on this. Pours a hazy yellow with a small amount of short-lasting, beige head. Chamomile scent. Prototypical Berliner Weiss aroma. Nice lemon and white vinegar tartness in flavor. I do get the ginger as well. Very sour in flavor. Really good Berliner Weiss taste. Light to medium body. Frothy in the palate. Quite complex for a non-barrel-aged sour.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

4562,"2016-08-30",4.4,"Funky, barn aroma. Slightly cloudy and almost looks almost like a chard. Wonderful tart flavor with the chamomile coming thru in the palate. The lemon helps with the tartness, too. And the finish is sour but crisp. OEC never disappoints.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","falco242"
4562,"2016-03-20",3.5,"750ml bottle pours a clear gold with some creamy, white head. Nose has lemon, butter, a little diaper/baby powder, passion fruit, a little peach.

4562,"2015-08-18",4.3,"Draught at the brewery, SourFest 8/15/15.Lovely bright white golden body with lemonskin tints and a small but fairly creamy white head.Good blend of malts and soft spicing in the nose, without any heavy lactic acidity. Not a sour ale, per se, but rather just an old style wit, most of which probably had a healthy dose of bacteria in them. Otherwise, lemony-citrus notes give a good acidity as very light ginger and honey balance. Sponge cake, light dough and a fresh, but not overdone herbal finish replete with just a shot of cheesiness. No alcohol, no flaws.Light and fluffy in the mouth, with ample carbonation, well-attenuated but still soft maltiness and a variety of honey, wheat, very mild ginger and light yogurt on the end. Incredibly drinkable and quite mild/reserved for all the things that are added. I really like that these guys seem just as adept at making barrel-aged, wild yeast-laden sour blends as they do at making lighter, playful, drinkable session ales. Tough to say whether Id use this or Exilis as the go-to session beer as both are exquisite. Sadly, I dont have to make that decision since I dont live close.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4562,"2014-09-15",4.1,"Growler filled two days ago at the Brewery. Pour has a straw golden color with a ring on the glass of white head. Aroma has tart wheat, herbs, light ginger, yeast, and pokes of flowers. Mouth feel is medium and has low side carbonation. Flavor is absolutely fantastic, mild tartness, sour wheat, citrus touches, flowers, mild ginger, and some light tea in the finish. I was expecting some kind of a white/wit style beer but this is pleasantly tart with a fantastic gentile addition of ginger, tea, and wet herbs. Very complex, lots of layers, has the flowery white ale thing, and a complementing yeastiness. So drinkable and all the pieces fit perfectly!","Connecticut, USA","blklab2007"

4562,"2014-07-27",3.8,"750ml growler in a tulip. Pours hazy golden with a lacy, white head. Aroma of sourness/tartness, pale malts, light citrus and spicy notes, hints of ginger, and some light floral notes. Flavor the same with a cool blend of the sourness and a witbier. Average texture.
