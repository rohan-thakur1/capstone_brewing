1971,"2017-05-24",4.0,"Dark robe, nice foam.
Smells like smoke, chocolate, caramel and hints of coffee, vanilla and herbs. Later some dark fruits.
Thin bubbles.
Medium body mainly on caramel and a bit of chocolate/coffee. Suprisingly not bitter finish, on caramel herbs. Fades quickly. Some vanilla aftertaste.
Smoke is quite discreet actually, hidden behind caramel.
Very nice refined and not agressive stout.","","vbaudry"

1971,"2017-04-21",3.5,"Appearance - very dark woody brown but-not-quite-black, can catch some light shining through at the edges, with a solid, compactly bubbled finger of hazel head that sticks around longer than I anticipated but which does dissipate completely eventually. 

Aroma - smells like a rather typical stout, with the roasted malts being the most prominent notes, and has a little bit of smokiness to it. Coffee notes are of black coffee or espresso, rather than the cafe latte that I expected from it being a milk stout. Not bad, but I was led to expect more by the server who recommended it to me. Luckily, I proved to have judged prematurely as, in the mouth, it proved to be more complicated than it smelled at first glance.

Taste - tastes more complicated than the smell might lead you to believe. The roasted malts and espresso are still there, but are now joined by quite a bit of milk chocolate, generous amounts of beautiful, pure vanilla and some tobacco (rather than smoke-smoke). Really, really nice.

Palate - not thick or syrupy at all, and doesnt have any alcohol sting or warmth.

Overall - definitely not a bad beer at all, but as I let it sit and come up to temperature the more the aromas seemed to fade to become somewhat watery even after re-swirling the glass. Solid 8/10 beer at the start, but declined to a 6/10 at the end because of this. DISCLAIMER: we were enjoying some Easter chocolate at the time (chocolate is not a bad pairing, I might add), and that might have simply overpowered my palate at the time.","","teddybearontap"
1971,"2017-04-17",3.6,"From 33cl bottle. Pours black with limited brownish foam. Aroma is a very nice mix of coffee, little chocolate, red fruits, cherries under spirits, maybe the smoked character is just barely noticeable. Body is medium with higher carbonation than the average stout. Taste starts with some sweetness, but this is soon substituted by a relentless bitterness.","Rimini, ITALY","rumore"
1971,"2017-04-12",3.8,"330ml bottle BB Mar 2018. Inky black with nice big fluffy tan persistent head. Prominent smooth smoky notes in the aroma, along with vanilla, chocolate and some roasty notes. The taste reflects the big smooth smokiness, big vanilla, dark chocolate, coffee, charred meat, spicy notes, herbal hop character, although just a little metallic in the finish. Smooth and chewy. Certainly a lot going on in this beer and just about all of it is really good, just the slight metallic twang that detracts.","AUSTRALIA","Shark_Pants"

1971,"2017-03-29",4.5,"Encore une très belle bière de la brasserie de Dochter van de Korenaar. Cette Smoked Vanilla Stout, à linstar de lensemble de beaucoup de bières de la brasserie porte dailleurs très bien son nom, Charbon, tant le côté fumé allié à une petite astringence finale procure une sensation charbonneuse. Mais cela ne doit pas pour autant faire oublier toutes les qualités de cette bière de caractère, goutue et équilibrée tournée principalement sur des arômes de café et chocolat (la vanille jouant plutôt les second rôles mais enrichissant de fort belle façon la ligne aromatique). En verre, le noir est profond (EBC de 120), avec de très fines bulles permettant tout juste à une mousse beige de napper la surface. Le nez est racé, avec un triptyque fève de cacao, café et arômes fumés sexprimant. A la dégustation, lattaque est de façon surprenante très souple avec une texture peu dense, sur des notes de café et de céréales fumés. A noter tout de même la présence dès lattaque dune pointe damertume. La deuxième bouche se densifie quelque peu et senrichit de chocolat et surtout de vanille. Subtils, ces notes de vanille perdureront jusquau final et viendront enrichir et se superposer à la ligne aromatique principale (du très beau travail). Larrière bouche quant à elle est davantage tournée vers lamertume, conférant de la fraîcheur sur de belles notes de café expresso. Lutilisation dHerkules à haute teneur en acide alpha, en complément du Styrian Goldings permet à lamertume qui arrive en troisième bouche dêtre franche et saillante, et ce malgré un IBU relativement peu élevé (IBU de 46). Lalcool est magistral. Avec un titrage uniquement de 7 % Abv, il permet de soutenir les arômes et la structure de la bière de façon incroyable. Sa progressivité est parfaite et cest sur le final quil sera le plus marqué, sur des notes fumées et tourbées. Avec des arômes fumés une peu moins prégnants et un sucre légèrement moins présents, nous étions au paradis...mais finalement être à la mine, entouré de charbon est également séduisant..","FRANCE","jybi"

Cependant, la fin amérésisée sur des notes nettement astringentes mais courtes en bouche rend la langue sèche. Cette finale donne une dégustation un peu âpre. Quant au corps malté je goûte ici un bel équilibre entre levure, le sucre moyen et pas trop envahissant et les les malt torréfiés  où les notes de brûlé restent discrètes avec le houblon minéral et astringent qui rendent le palais sec.

1971,"2012-08-11",3.7,"22.4 ounce bottle, best before end of January 2014.  Served in a nonic pint glass, the beer pours dark brown with some ruby red tints, along with an inch and a half frothy tan head that stays around for a while.  Theres also a lot of lacing left on the glass.  The aroma is nice, it smells like roasted and smoked malt, vanilla and some chocolate.  The taste is similar to the aroma, however I think the vanilla and roasted malt flavors are dominant, and the smoked malt is light in comparison.  Mouthfeel/body is on the light side of medium, it seems a bit thin, but its also easy enough to drink.  Moderate carbonation.  I think this is a solid brew, at $9.99 a bottle Ill likely buy it again in the future.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

Big, vast and slow disappearing light brown tan beige head on top of a black beer.

There is many roasted malts and bitter hops in the taste, there are some vanilla coal tints, hint of grassy herbs, some coffee, more and more good bitterness and a touch of roasted liquorice wood.
Aftertaste is good and strong bitter with some light dryness,  light roasted malts and some coffee tones. The bitterness stay for a long time!
