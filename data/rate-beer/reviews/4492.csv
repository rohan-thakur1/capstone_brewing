4492,"2016-05-01",4.0,"12 oz. bottle jcwattsrugger left in my fridge. I dont think he intended to, but you know what they say about possession being 9/10ths, blah, blah. Poured a deep cola brown, tinged with ruby with a massive 3 finger rocky beige head. Took awhile to settle down. Aroma has some cola like qualities to it as well as some heavy malt and spicy phenols. Heavy caramel and burnt brown sugar on the taste. Sweetness is kept in check by a substantial alcohol presence as well as the unknown spices. Full in body and packs a punch. Very nice!","Wilton, New Hampshire, USA","mcox90"

Aroma: The aroma is sweet and malty, lots of dark fruit, not a whole lot else

Appearance: Pours a dark orange-brown color, with a small beige head, and drippy lace

Flavor: It has a lot of dark fruit and malt to the flavor, pretty much the nose, but slightly better

Palate: The body is light than you might expect, but still fairly full, with a smooth mouthfeel

Overall Impression: 
I was really excited to try an American EIsbock, as I have not seen too many breweries making these. I quite enjoyed this. Heavy malty. Well done.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
