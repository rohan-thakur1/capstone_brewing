You get a good, honey-kinda graham cracker base, with a nice nutmeg edge to it, but still less spicy than a lot of modern american winter warmer nutmeg beers can be. The honey base actually holds up to the nutmeg here -- quite well... Its a great host. There is a big sweetness to it too, and a mild sweet/spicy bite, with some mild alcohol warmth...
