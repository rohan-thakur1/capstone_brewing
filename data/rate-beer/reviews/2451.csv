2451,"2015-04-21",3.8,"2 oz from bottle (375 ml). 2011 Harvest.

Appearance: Clear bright orange-golden with nice legs.

Aroma: A bit of alcohol at first, but it then settles down a bit to let the apples shine juicy McIntosh. Theres also some caramel and very light spiciness. 

Taste: Medium sweetness and moderate acidity presence with a bit of alcohol, overripe apples, caramel and mild spiciness.

Palate: Medium body. Not super thick. Moderately sticky. Warming finish. Lingering sweet apples aftertaste.

Overall: A tad boozy, but otherwise its a rather classic well-executed Ice Cider. It showcase the apples quite well.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

2451,"2009-10-18",3.9,"Bottle ( 375ml clear, corked ).  Purchased at 2009 Mondiale from the Cidery booth.  Slightly amber-tinged gold, clear, slightly thick and oily-looking, minimal white head.  Aroma of moderate alcohol, tangy, slightly overripe golden apple (with some skin);  simple, a bit delicate, very good.  Taste follows - vaguely of baked alaska and slightly green off-dry chablis, doesnt seem very sweet up front, but you get sweet tangy ripe apple in the finish - quite tasty, I would love this with the pate-maison at Le Select Bistro.  Slick, somewhat acidic mouthfeel, a delicate mineral tanginess in the finish, moderately alcohol -TASTING (but seems to pack more of a punch than the 10.5% ABV listed) - I would definitely get this again, well above middle of the pack, IMO.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

Bonne gazéification, le sucré de la pomme est présent autour de lalcool et je ressent une légère amertume très agréable malgré le sucré dominant.
