1999,"2014-01-26",3.8,"Poured up on tap into a squat tulip glass at the Wilderness. It pours with a dark amber body that supports a tan head. The aroma offers up chocolate, molasses covered cherries, black licorice and some earth dark roasted malts. The taste has a mix of dark roasted malts, chocolate, a light earthy tobacco note and then dark sweet cherry like fruity notes wrapped in dried molasses. A bit on the fruity side but pretty nice.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
