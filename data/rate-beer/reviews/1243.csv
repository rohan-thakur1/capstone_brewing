Rich soyey roast aroma. Deep ruddy brown, small tight head. Amazingly light palate for an 8.5% beer, no hint of heaviness or strength. Nice roasty body, soyey hint remains. After swallowing, the dry bitter hops kick in, and youre left with hops and soy. Dang, thats a very tasty, and dangerously drinkable doppelbock.

Aroma has lots of chocolate and some malt. Flavour has chocolate, bready malt and sweet syrupy notes. Finishes somewhat hoppy with mild tartness. Palate is a bit too high on CO2. Some mineral-like dryness and lingering hops at the end if the glass making a difference with the most traiditional German ones. Clean and good dp, which could improve with less hops though.
