3492,"2016-06-06",3.8,"Imperial Pint at the Brewery in St Louis, Missouri. The pour is a hazed brown golden copper with a small off white head. Pretty lace coats the glass as the beer drinks down. The aroma is toasty caramel, nut malt and soft floral. The taste is the fresh clean nut and malt sweetness of the nose, along with a pleasant bit of caramel upfront and finishes dry with clean floral. Very clear expressions of the flavors and nice integration. The palate is light bodied with soft natural carbonation and the clean finish. Super drinkable, this was really good.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

3492,"2014-03-11",3.6,"Civil Life is about session beers I think. So this will fit the bill if your interested in session beers. Craft beer has become like cell phones... you find value in discovering what u like through the many brands available. So to generally critique a brand/type of beer is more subjective than ever because its probably good but just not to a critics particular tastes.","Illinois, USA","jayzz"
3492,"2014-03-10",3.5,"On tap at Global Brew. Pours a slightly hazy brown with a thin tan head. Aromais caramel and bread. Taste is sweet caramel malt, buttered biscuits and crackers. Nice, simple and delicious.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
3492,"2012-12-15",3.6,"Draft at the brewery.  Deep brown and red. Nan off white thin layer. I smell grasdy hops and bready malts.  Fairly rich malts are tasted first and they bring dry chocolate and bread.  Hops are soft and add some bitterness and fruit.  Gentle and subtle.  Very nice and surprisingly bold.  I love the 3.9% alcohol.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
3492,"2012-11-02",4.7,"UPDATED: MAY 26, 2016 Tasted on tap at brewpub in a nonic half-pint glass. It poured a mostly-clear, deep reddish-copper color with thin but persistent white head. Aromas of husky cereal grains, freshly-baked bread and dark toast, earthy and citrusy English hops, distinctive ale yeast esters. Excellent true-to-style English mild flavors too: toasty again and mildly roasty, nutty, biscuity, brown bread, fruit cake, chocolate milk, nutty toffee. Medium-heavy body, in the sense of pleasant residual sweetness and chewy mouthfeel, but it also gave a crisp and light impression. Somehow smooth and creamy, but with a simultaneously chalky essence of suspended yeast and mineral-water. Long-lasting multi-layered aftertaste. This is a style Ive been researching and hunting-down for awhile; Im confident this is my freshest and most authentic example yet. Loved it, Im coming back soon for a growler.
UPDATE: Ive had this several more times, and Ive just gotta raise my already high rating. Accuse me of a hometown bias, if you must, but this is a masterpiece of a beer, one of my favorites ever. So incredibly complex in an unassuming way. I cant get enough!","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"
3492,"2012-08-24",3.8,"On cask at the brewpub - Pours dark brown with a sturdy tan head.  The aroma has toffee, caramel, bread and a nice smoothness to the toast.  It has a medium body with soft lush carbonation.  The flavor begins with traits of the aroma, but much drier and has some cracker and crusty bread.  This offsets the caramel and toffee traits for a pleasantness.  There is also a bit of roasted nuts.  The finish has some mineral traits and a bit of aspirin, but it seems to work for this in the big picture.  Really nice mild ale.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
3492,"2012-07-23",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2012 Half-pint at the brewpub, served in a small nonic glass. Pours an amber-hued brown, somewhat cloudy at first, with a finger of off-white head that dissipates into a film and ring. The aroma has a nice toasty, nutty character, and so does the flavor. Just a slight hint of caramel/brown sugar sweetness, but really just toasty, nutty, a little earthy, and mellow the whole way through. This one is really smooth. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation. Great mild ale.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
