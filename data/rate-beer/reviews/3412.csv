Also slightly woody, oaky even hints of vanillas. In the end slightly acidic, dry and bittering. In general this is not the best brew I had from Wicked Weed and not the best sour brown Ive ever had. This is something between sour red and sour brown - not very malty/sweet, neither sour and dry. Pretty well drinkable.","Sosnowiec, POLAND","BlazerT"

Smells semi-tart and funky with well-balanced notes of cherry and apple cider vinegar. Tastes like it smells with a pleasantly tart semi-dry medium to medium full-bodied mouthfeel. Good beer.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
