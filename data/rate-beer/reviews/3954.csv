3954,"2010-12-08",3.1,"My first infused sake!  7/12 styles down!  12/8/10.  Small bottle.  Cloudy off-white greenish pour.  Light sour citrusy aroma with lemon peel and pear.  Sweet fruity flavor that is definitely pear with hints of lemon peel.","Georgia, USA","drowland"
3954,"2010-10-14",2.5,"(187ml bottle, courtesy of Mora2000)  Pours a hazy grayish green body with descent legs.  Aroma of pear and vanilla.  Flavor of pear, lemon, rice, and almonds.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
3954,"2010-10-02",3.0,"(6.3oz bottle thanks to mora2000) yellow-greenish with a ring of bubbles with no legs. Nose of melon, celery, pear. Taste of pear, sugar, rice, smooth, marshmallow, with nice carbonation and a fruity finish.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
3954,"2010-08-30",3.0,"Pours a hazy clear color (can something even be that color?). The aroma and flavor are very strong pear. I dont get much, if anything else. Not bad, but nothing that reminds me of a sake.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
3954,"2010-04-08",2.9,"Bottle at redlight redlight.  Pours a really lovely color, cloudy white silver.  A little bit fizzy.  The nose has some nice elements.  Pear, floral, and some spring like blossom aromas but there is something just a little wet dog about it.  Tastes pretty sweet but the pear gives it a drier element than it would probably normally have.  That wet dog thing comes out a little more in the flavor.  Pretty refreshing.  Not bad, but that one element keeps me from loving it.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Teege"
3954,"2010-04-08",2.6,"Pear juice on the nose with hints of peppermint and anise.  Pours a cloudy white with soda like carbonation.  Pear soda, not overly sweet, with a minty back ground, not bad really.","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
3954,"2010-03-29",2.7,"Small clear bottle from Nuggett Market in Vacaville, CA. Chilled. Hazy pear juice color. A few bubbles. Aromas of fusil oil and arguably pear. Light body, mild carbonation. Very. Rather tasty. Fruit and carbohydrate. Some sort of overall, but low level sweetness. Certainly drinkable.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
3954,"2010-02-19",2.8,"18.7 cL clear bottle. Pours hazy and pale yellowish with a fully gone head. Aroma is dry phenolic and light perry. Sweet, light citric and perry dry. Holds a distinct reminder of the rice base in the flavour. Dry and ricey finish.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
3954,"2009-11-17",2.5,"Cloudy white pour.  No head.  Sake aroma with apples and pears.  Flavor is all apples and pears.  Very little true sake flavor.   Odd beverage.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
3954,"2009-09-09",2.1,"Another crappy sake shared by BEARDO.  you fucking douchecanoe. This one looks like cloudy toilet water and smells like a nasty over-sweet pear.  Flavors of honey, cream, and pear abound which might sound good but guess what?  It sucks. Just like Ryan.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
3954,"2009-09-03",2.8,"Thanks to Ryan for this.  All this needs is a ruffie or a little GHB and a high school party.","raleigh, North Carolina, USA","ucusty"
3954,"2008-09-10",3.0,"Pours with a hazy white body. Aroma of pear, some sort of sticky sweetness, kiwi, mango, orange, and rice. Taste is sweet and fruity but not great. Sort of a fruity wine cooler sort of taste. Soda like carbonation. Not really what I think of when I think of infused sake, but similar to the rest of their lineup.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
3954,"2008-08-26",3.2,"Bottle: Pours a beige white color with no head and a little zing. The nose is fruity with some light melon and kiwi, some koji and maybe pear, but it seems sweeter. The flavor is juicy and sweet, I like the dissolved candy necklace note from the previous rating. Finishes balanced. Good flavored sake, much better than the yuzu.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3954,"2008-07-02",3.7,"Pours a slightly hazed lemony white  color with a short fused head that rests to nonexistent. I can smell the bamboo with a gentle touch of sweetness that has no definable persuasion. Light  with good carbonation. Defined mild sweetness like dissolved candy necklace with the classic sake characteristics although mildly. A nice infusion of candy fruit and sake is all I can say. It’s really not that bad. Theres some acidity to linger on the palate.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"
