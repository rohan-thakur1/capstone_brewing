2668,"2017-03-11",3.9,"Poured into a snifter, the appearance was a pure dark black color with a nice looking fingers worth of off white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Adequate messy lace.
The aroma had some roasty coffee beans up front with a slight milk chocolate, and then dark chocolate, quite robust. Vanilla and some woody sweetness round it out.
The flavor pulls a drying sweetness from the blend of the wood to the coffee beans and malts to play with a rugged semi-sweet and bitter aftertaste. Leads with a semi-sticky sort of roasty finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fair sipping quality about it. Good carbonation. ABV felt right as where the brewer said it does.
Overall, says its an American strong ale on here, I thought this was an American Imperial Stout. Thats what I rated it as and believe it to be. Wonderful as an American Imperial Stout, nowhere close to an American Strong ale.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Alkohol: 10 % obj.

Kolor: Czarny jak węgiel. Zero przejrzystości.

Piana: Beżowa, sycząca, średnio i grubopęcherzykowa.
Z prędkością światła i wielkim sykiem redukuje się do bezwzględnego zera. Nie pozostawia po sobie nawet milimetra kołnierzyka.
Minimalistyczne zacieki na TeKu.

Zapach: Rządzą tutaj słody.
Jest przypieczona skórka od chleba, toffi, karmel, miód, a także czekolada.
W oddali trochę ciemnych owoców.
Pojawia się również paloność i delikatna żywiczna nuta pochodząca od chmielu.

Smak: Zdecydowanie bardziej słodowy niż chmielowy.
Odnaleźć tutaj można całą fabrykę czekoladowych sztabek z wyraźną kawową nutą na finiszu.
Profil słodowy rysuję się: miodem, posmakiem tostowym, karmelem i toffi.
Uzupełnia go subtelna chmielowa, żywiczna nuta, która jest jednak tylko tłem dla słodów.
Goryczka jest średnia, dobrze wpleciona. Finisz jest bardzo trudny do określenia: balansuje między słodkim, a wytrawnym.
Drewniane niuanse dębowej beczki przeplatają się z lekką wanilią.
Alkohol cholernie zdradliwy. Pijesz to bez zupełnego wyczucia jego mocy, a kiedy wstajesz wtedy dopiero objawia Ci się jego ciężar.
Cudowna, lepka tekstura (nazwa piwa idelanie odnosi się do tego).
Jest tylko jedna mała rzecz która zaburza nieco doznania - jest to zbyt wysokie wysycenie.
Przez nie piwo chwilami staje się ciężkie.

Wysycenie : Wysokie.

Podsumowanie:
Styl American Strong Ale według opisu BJCP określany jest jako ""malty-but-hoppy"" czyli słodowy-ale-chmielowy.
Taka jest też charakterystyka tego piwa.
Zdecydowanie bardziej słodowe (karmel, tosty, skórka od chleba, palone słody, ciemne owoce, czekolada, przypieczona skórka od chleba), ale także z żywicznymi akcentami amerykańskich chmieli.
Styl nie jest tak bogaty i mocny jak American Barley Wine, ale jednocześnie nie jest tak mocno nachmielony jak Double IPA.
Balans ciągle przechodzi na stronę słodów.
""Stara Lepkość"", bo tak można przetłumaczyć nazwę tego piwa jest trunkiem gęstym i lepkim, dlatego nazwa idealnie pasuje do klimatu.
Jedynym minusem tutaj jest zbyt wysokie nagazowanie, które sprawia, że momentalnie w połowie butelki stawałem się pełny i nie maam tutaj na myśli pełni z powodu nadmiaru słodyczy w piwie.
Piwo świetne, dostojne, ale wybitnie deserowe i degustacyjne.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

Consumed: Aug. 28, 2015
Misc.: Bottled on March 25, 2015

Poured a black color with six fingers of frothy, tan head. Not usual for Port as it wasnt a gusher. Very good semi-layered foamy lacing on the sides of the glass. Very good retention. (Sight - 4.13)

Smelled dark chocolate, dark fruits, light tobacco, toasty nuts, toffee, caramel, dark cocoa nibs, chocolate syrup, hazelnut, some coffee and dark plum. (Smell - 3.88)

Taste followed the nose somewhat, but felt a bit more like a Russian Imperial Stout. Got thick dark chocolate, coffee, roasty malts, toasty nuts, toffee, caramel, toasty oak, chocolate candy and hazelnut. Alcohol was well hidden. (Taste - 3.88)

Full body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. (Feel - 4.00)

Slightly disappointed in this one, but Id probably have it again. Great value for $6.99.

Flavour has toffee and molasses core matched by fairly hard roasts, with coffee and cacao bean, burnt wood, touch of tobacco and dark fruit. Towards the finish, dries a lot, wood and earth, roast, pine, cacao, a bit of toffee lingering. Long dry aftertaste is moderately bitter and roasty. Full bodied with soft carb.

2668,"2015-05-24",4.3,"It feels like a bit of a waste to have such an amazing brew as the last beer on a long-ish beer tasting evening. Still, an extraordinary beer like this one will always manage to show off regardless of any palate fatigue. It pours a pitch black body with a light-brown head that laces the glass well, and that ends up as a thin layer. The aroma is very strong and has some incredible notes of chocolate, chocolate sauce, coffee and a myriad of other roasted notes. The very strong flavour follows the aroma, with additional notes of dark caramel and vanilla. The taste is moderate sweet and the long-lasting finish is pretty heavy bitter. The mouthfeel is amazing, it actually is as viscous and full-bodied as the name indicates. Its creamy and smooth on the palate and with a moderate carbonation. Brilliant!

Something between a strong ale and a russian imperial stout. I was expecting it to have more features of the latter and therefore was a bit disappointed. On the other hand that was not a wise expectation since there is not a single word on the cover mentioning it is a RIS.","Berlin, GERMANY","dambor"

A: Pours a black beer with two fingers of latte head. This falls slowly to a thick quilt of the same. Cobweb lacing. Clarity is irrelevant. 

S: Smells like oak, dark chocolates, prunes, molasses, alcohol, hints of licorice. Beyond the alcohol, which seems a bit strong, the beer smells quite sweet. 

T: Refer to the smell for the taste, then add some graham and rye bread flavors. The alcohol isnt as offensive as I had prepared myself for, instead, the malts become spicy in nature and complement the addition of the oak. I gotta say, as it warms the beer seems like it becomes hollow in the middle, hard to describe, just has a dead spot.

M: Thick. Moderate carb. Sticky and chewy finish. Hardcore.

O: This is pretty good. I cant say I prefer it to some other oak aged stouts, but its nonetheless a nice beer.

No barrel aged presence in this beer (except I suspect it is what smooths out the brown-sugar taste). Mildly disappointing. Palate: for a beer named after a motor oil, it sure is thin.

The oak comes through more in flavor than it did in the aroma. Carbonation is average--I was expecting something more like Older Viscosity, which I remember being near flat. The body is fairly thick, but its not the sludge texture Older had; its actually just kind of an average body for a beer of this caliber.

Aroma: The nose is roasted malts, a little bourbon, wood/oak, some vanilla, and a little chocolate

Appearance: Pours a thick, black color with a thumb-worth of foamy brown head

Flavor: The taste is roasty and a little sweet, with bozzy notes, oak/wood, and a bit of a hop backing

Palate: The body leans full, with some thickness to it, an average carbonation, and some decently hidden alcohol

Labeled as Bottled 1-24-12. Yeasty aroma features chocolate, raisin, bran muffin, coffee, mocha, toffee, rich caramel, plum, tobacco, vanilla, and licorice scents. The aroma comes pouring out. Complex and appetizing smell but not as amazing as it could be. Pours a rich, dark brown with a moderate amount of thick, uneven, taupe/tan head. Produces extensive lacing. Rich, tarry, boozy, vegetal (celery, herbs) taste features cream, licorice, char, prune juice, and chocolate flavors. Alcohol highly noticeable. Flavorful but excessively tarry and boozy. Long, strong, roasted aftertaste. Also a touch of paint flavor in the aftertaste. Creamy and lively in the palate. Warming alcohol effect. A bit of a challenge to imbibe. The beer was very hot; it could have used more aging. It is undeniably good across the board, but it misses the magic of the best of the style. Im kicking myself because I think if I had let this sit in the cellar for a couple of years (as I often let beers do), it might have been really great.

Aftertaste is mostly barley malts with all that comes along with barley malts, but the most present in the aftertaste is the caramel and toffee notes, with bitterness, dryness, toasted notes and the autumnal herbs.

The taste is pretty heavy on the wood. Dark chocolate, bitter hops, some barrel bits. Pretty well balanced out, a worthy candidate for your beer cellar, I would imagine.

The feel is pretty oily and thick. Give its genre, though, its rather drinkable.

Overall, glad to have had the opportunity to try this and look forward to testing the other bottle after its had some time maturing downstairs.","Orono, Minnesota, USA","FURLYSURIOUS"

2668,"2012-03-15",3.3,"From notes.  

Old Viscosity pours a motor oil brown color, almost black, with a dollup of mocha froth on top.  The head fades to just a few spots of carbonation on top of the beer.  A surprisingly light transparent edge is also visible when I tilt the glass.

The aroma is full of dark, bitter chocolate and roast, nearly burnt malt.  An oak presence seems to attach itself to every other aroma as well.  There are hints of plums and raisins as it warms.

The flavor is even more controlled by the chocolate and malt notes.  The dark chocolate is pleasantly complex, with a light milk sweetness, a burst of cocoa flavor, a strong bitterness, and a richness only found in good dark chocolate.  The malt has just a touch of smoke, but it is mostly just very fully roasted.  Some coffee grounds add to the bitterness.  Some vanilla, plums, and raisins come in midway through the sip, more so after it has warmed a bit.  A strong woody oak presence comes in toward the end, adding some spice to the finish.  The end is a touch sweet, somewhat spicy, fairly bitter, and noticeably boozy.

The body is on the fuller side of medium for the style, but aside from the alcohol presence it drinks fairly easily.  The creamy carbonation is on the light side.

The oak and alcohol take off significant points from the score.  Although this is an interesting beer, it is nowhere as bewildering as the description on the label would suggest.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

T - Starts out with some strong roasted chocolate malts with a bit of coffee and some oak with a touch of sweetness. Through the middle, some earthy hops come through with some bitterness and some more oak with a bit of caramel. The finish is a mix of coffee and chocolate with some earthy hop flavor and a bit of booze coming through.

M - Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth and a bit thick and viscous and almost a bit chewy with a warming finish.

Ok taste.. better than I have been giving it credit for as there is enough quiet complexity. Spice and breathable alcohol notes, caramel, anise, astringent, coffee, more hard spices that really dig into my taste buds and roof of my mouth.

Aroma is not overwhelmingly strong, but there are some nice hints of licorice, chocolate, cardboard (only in a good way) and faint malts. The body is chewy, but perhaps a bit lighter than I would have thought, and the carbonation is mostly soft. The taste is dominated by strong licorice. Also there are notes of warming alcohol, strong leather, lasting sweet chocolate, milky vanilla and roasted coffee. Really nice and scary light drinkable for a 10% abv.

Palate is relatively light for the well-hidden ABV and flavor profile, making it dangerously easy to drink although I think it somehow would have been better with a bit more muscle toning.

Les saveurs sont succulentes, dune intensité contrôlée, fastueuses sans être exagérées : le caramel se mute en mélasse fruitée, les grains rôtis effleurés par la fumée de la torréfaction sont caressés par la force tranquille du fût de chêne et les houblons qui réussissent à percer cette ode maltée partagent un espace fin avec des flaveurs de réglisse et dalcool.  En bouche, le liquide est bien charnu, il donne une impression de densité, sa texture est bien visqueuse, moelleuse, expansive.  Leffervescence vivante du début se fatigue rapidement et cette modération apporte une sensationnelle profondeur au liquide.

It pours a dense, dark brown with *gasp* a foamy tan head that sticks for a good while, but doesnt leave too much lacing.

The smell is very oaky. There is a good bit of vanilla. There is a dark, fruity, almost grapey flavor under that along with some chocolate and roastiness.

The flavor has a big sweet alcoholic bite, but it mellows. There is some oxidized fruit, caramel, coffee, chocolate, and some oak in the flavor. A good rich flavor, but perhaps a bit blunt in its delivery.

Despite the name I found this to be pretty watery.

Despite the alcohol presence, this one drinks really easy thanks to the thinner body and smooth carbonation.

I loved the older about a year ago, so how is this old one?
Dark dark brown with huge head that dies right away leaving a very small beige rim.
Roasted grinded coffee nose and taste. Very much like a porter with roasted notes. Ends hoppy bitter but that in no way changes the porter impression.
Quite high carbonation, a surprice since older was still.
Cannot help being a little disappointed. Dont get me wrong, its a fantastic porter but not what I hoped for. (6-3-8-4-15=36).
As it warms, more alcoholic, more complex, more barrel-aged:-)
Bourbon notes show up now. Really almost hurts the mouth now. Alcohol is very present.
Now way more than a porter, and I must up the rating. Really smooth and well-made. Glad to have had this one.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","jesperhammer"

2668,"2011-01-24",4.5,"After poring, I thought for sure this was an imperial stout because of how black it is. It tastes are very unique. Not many stouts have this flavor, some would but those are the very highly rated like Bells Expedition. It misses one thing most imperial stouts have which is a dark bitter chocolate flavor, it has more of a dark fruit flavor. I assume that is the reason this beer was labeled as an American Strong ale instead of a stout.  I cant get this beer in my home town but was able to find it in Seattle area. Well worth the wait, got late September 2010.  Drinking it now. It aged very well though I dont know how it would have tasted before ageing, but I found it very smooth. It was also difficult to taste any alcohol notes. This has very sweet flavor from the beginning, middle and end. A beer worth paying and finding if you can.","North Carolina, USA","bensbrews"

4.5 S: Very nice aroma. Theres a lot of dark malt aromas, but nothing burnt. Seems like there are several different crystal malts going on here and lend a complex sweetness. This sweetness is backed up with a hit of espresso. In the background, there are dark fruits with emphasis on black cherries. Touch of alcohol in the nose. This would be an easy five if the aroma were more pronounced.

4.5 T: I can see where the confusion comes from when classifying this beer. I taste Olde Ale, Stout, and Barleywine. Dark fruits including black cherries and raisins. Sweet caramel malts and plenty of espresso in the taste as well. Healthy bitterness from hops and dark malts. Oak and alcohol show up to the party and both complement. I love oaked brews, so this was a great addition.

The pour fills the glass with a gorgeous dark chocolate body primly topped by a wafter thin chocolate cream head. Apportioned with a tantalizing chocolate and roast coffee nose--blissful. Bitter dark chocolate body upon what a discernably high caliber fresh-milled grain backbone. Just the brew for the cooler seasons.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"

2668,"2010-07-04",3.6,"This pours out a dark red-brown, but not nearly as black or as viscous as the label would have you believe.  A thin head lows into a sticky lacing.  On the nose there is a sweet wooded vanilla reminiscent of an unpeated whiskey.  Then comes ash, tobacco and leather with subtle notes of chocolate and coffee, and a hint of balsamic vinegar.  In the mouth it gives over to the barrel aging.  Foremost is vanilla and smoke, but there is a vinousness here; lots of sharp tannins and nutty bittering, meaning that this drinks like an imperial porter and not a stout.  The smokiness is strong.  It rises to the back of the nose where it remains, giving off the lingering aroma of an ashtray - but in a good sort of a way.  Its like walking into an English country pub on a Sunday afternoon.  Mouth feel is creamy, but could be thicker.  The finish returns to ash and oak.  In the end it is a complex, challenging beer, and enjoyably so.

I smell: Chocolate (sweet, not dark), vanilla, roasted malts. I taste: Chocolate, tobacco,  some coffee-like bitterness, and a lingering burn that is a combination of hops and alcohol.

S-Milk chocolate, bourbon sweetness, vanilla, roasted cofee, and a touch of phenols. Pretty complex and I cant pick up everything.

T- The flavor upfront is somewhat subtle and offers mostly dark chocolate and roasted coffee bean flavors. The roasted characteristics come through a bit more for the finish along with a bourbon sweetness and heat. What lingers is roasted flavors and a nice warm alcohol heat (nothing overpowering).

P-High tingly carbonation but mouthfeel is very smooth and viscous. Not at all influenced by alcohol.

O- This is a nice strong ale/hybrid. My 1st Port brew that isnt an IPA. This makes me really want to age on of these...or to find older viscosity. Very good and well done. Its hot...but not too hot.

2668,"2010-02-21",4.1,"For some reason, this beer always knocks me for a loop. Even more so than most bombers of 10%. It pours brown with a brown head. Thick, but not as thick as you might think. The aroma is of oak wood, vanilla, chocolate, nuts and raisins. The flavor is full of wood, raisins, plums, molasses, vanilla, a touch nutty but very sweet. A nice subtle roasted quality in the finish with more oak. Very flavorful, but lacks the next step of depth the the flavor profile.

Comment:
It wasnt very complex, however felt well balanced, the flavours all complement each other in a good way. There also werent any off-flavours. The alcohol was well hidden, it only revealed itself in the alcoholic warmth that followed after taking a sip.

I liked this beer but I would have preferred it with a bit more flavour and complexity. The chocolate is definitely there but I would have liked some more coffee and dark malty flavours.","Örebro, SWEDEN","olsvammel"

The aroma was strong chocolate syrup, anise, rum and floral hops. The flavor was a delightful mix of cocoa, coffee, anise, rum, raisin, wood, port wine and floral hops.

-from the bottle

Poured from a bomber into my Duvel tulip glass.

Pours a pitch black color with no highlights what so ever. This is the darkest strong ale ive ever seen. I would call it an RIS or Double stout even. Initially there was a huge three and a half finger head that gave way to about a one finger head in 30 seconds or so. The head is a dark tan. Almost brownish color that actually showed some reddish highlights during the pour.

This one smells delicious. If i close my eyes i would swear there was a slice of double chocolate cake in front of me. And next to the cake is a mug full of fresh brewed sumatra coffee. Smells great. Lets get on to the tasting.

According to what ive read on this beer its blended with 20% that was aged in oak barrels. The oak is there if you look for it. I might not have noticed it had it not stated it on the bottle. The dominate flavors are chocolate and coffee. A touch of vanilla bean and oak. The booze is pretty much hidden other then a slight warmth in the gut after a few sips.

With the description on the label and the comparisons to used motor oil one would think this would have a super thick and heavy mouthfeel. Thats not the case. There is a creaminess and smoothness that i like. The beer is sweet throughout until the aftertaste where a tiny amount of bitterness comes through.

Drinkability is decent. I probably would only consume 1 bomber at any given time. It still is a delicious and easy to drink beer. Port Brewing calls it a mix between a porter,a stout,a barleywine and a strong ale. I think its more like a Russian Imperial Stout. But what do i know.","Pennsylvania, USA","BigMike"

Viscous mouthfeel engulfs the tastebuds and takes them on a nice little coffee, chocolate, anise, and plums adventure.

Excellent retention and some excellent lacing, also.

Big maltiness scents mix with a slight touch of booziness. Mild chocolate covers dark fruits. Cherries and dark berries, mostly. Decent coffee nuttiness. Hints of vanilla caramels.
Unfortunately, all of these scents are fairly minimal and you really have to search to find them. Very light nose.

Big chocolate taste mixes with hints of coffee. Dark fruit sweetness. Light hints of vanilla and caramel, probably from the bourbon barrel aging. Big malts and toasted nuttiness. Some burnt brown sugar and molasses. Very slight licorice notes.

Good full bodied brew. Sadly, not as big and full as I expected it to be. Its close to oily, but not quite there, yet. Carbonation is a tiny bit lacking. Could be so much better with a few more tiny bubbles. Lack of creaminess really hurts this one.

2668,"2009-11-02",4.1,"This beer is terrific, and worth the hype!  This is an excellent, extremely dry beer that seemed to me to be somewhere between an extremely full-bodied porter and a very dry and drinkable Russian Imperial Stout.  It had a dark body with a medium amount of white head.  As I poured, I thought this beer to be a rather viscous Russian Imperial Stout.  Aroma was extremely roasty, molasses, and raisins.  Flavor is more of the same, with an emphasis on the dark roasty notes.  Mouthfeel is extremely crisp and dry, and was not sticky or slick.  Very good.

2668,"2009-10-14",4.5,"What an intense beer!  This offering is awesome from first sight to last sip.  The beer pours basically a black color with a very generious, soft and fluffy brown head.  The head leaves a minimal amout of lacing around the glass, but Im not about to hold that against this beer.  The aroma is full of dark roasted coffee, cream, chocolate, light hops and a slight hint of bread.  The body is thick, rich and extremely delicious.  This beer is so dangerous due to its extreme drinkablility and smooth body, but yet it punches back with its strong character.  The alcohol level is not present in the actual body, but reserves its right to smack you in the face.  And it does just that.  After a bomber of this, Im feeling pretty good!  The flavors are really intense and delicious, with notes of chocolate, vanilla, roasted coffee, floral hops, creamy malt and bread.  The finish begs you to take another sip, and then another, and then another.  This bomber went way too quickly.  I wish I had another.

2668,"2009-08-01",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2010 The pour is coal black with a fairly small, dark tan, pillowy head which is mostly diminishing and leaves minimal lace.  Nose is great with plenty of sweet, malt notes; lots of maple syrup, milk chocolate, toasted caramel, vanilla, molasses, light mocha coffee, and undertones of scorched maple, fresh cut oak, and some hints at peat and toasted oats.  Flavor is amazing with similar sweet notes of mostly maple, molasses and vanilla but also some toasted caramels, rich chocolate, more lightly scorched maple wood, hints at dark coffee, faint red currant notes (almost fruitcake-like), and just hints at leather, peaty smoke, and more oatmeal tones.  Palate is good but not as thick as I would have thought; nearly lively to start but soft to lively throughout, mild warmth, full body, and velvety mouthfeel.  I would have thought that the palate would be more round and chewy given the appearance.  Finishes with some moderately light bitter notes of scorched maple, peat, and moderately dark coffee with sweet notes of molasses, chocolate, and currant lingering.  Way too sweet and malt forward to be a stout or porter but I dont know what category this would even fit into.  One of my favorite flavors in a beer in a long while with so many malt complexities and just enough wood and dark notes to keep from becoming cloying.

Palate remains lighter than I expected, certainly less full than your average Imperial Stout.  Overall, Id have to say that drinking this is quite special, though I found it a bit frustrating, as it lacks the fullness of a good RIS, or the crisp body of a schwarzbier.

Nose is chicory, semi-sweet chocolate, coffee, some oak and barrel vanilla notes, and some slight booze.  Flavor is awesome:  chocolate takes center stage with the rest of the flavors as supporting cast.  I get overripe dark fruit, chocolate, slightly subtle vanilla and oak, whiskey, and coffee with licorice.  Gentle carbonation and a silky mouthfeel also contribute to this masterpiece.  Outstanding imperial stout.  It burns with some alcohol as it goes down, and lingers with chocolate and whiskey.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"

I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased at PlumpJack Wines in San Francisco, California on 31-March-2008, sampled at home in Washington on 14-March-2009.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"

Pretty looking beer that is on the black side with a thin tan head, that does die down to very little.

Bit of heat from the alcohol too on the nose.  In the mouth, its full and interesting, but not big wowing me.  Yes the dark plum, damson fruit carries on into the swallow with some blackcurrant too.  Swallow is ok, but also some acidity and thinness there too.  Heat on finish, with some tongue tingling hops.  A solid beer with some decent dark choc and espresso coffee notes with some decent dark fruit flavours.  Doesnt wow me in any way.  Solid and a good drink, but I think I probably want something more from this.  Burn on the finish after a few quaffs is a bit of a turn off.  Oh and Munster are kicking Sale in the Heineken Cup.

Flavor is very similar to the nose we experienced but with stronger coffee and toffee notes.

Roasted malt, bread, milk chocolate, chestnuts, plums and hints of dark fruit, licorice, oak vanilla, and hints of cocoa and floral hops.  The hops are not sharp or bitter, but instead meld nicely into the rich malt.  The mouthfeel is soft and rich.  Wonderfully silky.  Great beer.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"

Some, not much, lacing.  Coffee, baker’s chocolate, vanilla, mascerated plums, a subtle port wine hint and charred wood on the nose.  Oily body.  A silky smooth  montage of flavors...espresso and cream, cocoa powder, cinnamon....I’ll let it warm a bit.  The warming time brings out a chocolate covered cherry finish.  Not as hoppy as an impy, but it is detectable, nonetheless it  is strongly overpowered by a welcomed sweetness coupled with an ashen dryness.

2668,"2008-10-05",4.3,"Black with hues of chestnut. Tight and creamy cap of gray-tan foam. Sophisticated malt-driven aromas of chocolate wafers, malted milk balls, creamed coffee, caramelized malt, and scorched malt hulls. Light whiff of hops, red licorice, burnt toffee, plum, and raisin. Carbonation softly caresses the tongue. Bottle conditioned. Weighty layers of malt immediately unfold upon the palate as a balancing kiss of lustrous chocolate-covered plums and black cherry fruitiness shyly emerges. Sturdy, seemingly impenetrable malt body is partially lifted by a poignant bite of roasted malt hulls. Dab of coffee teases the palate as it wavers in and out of the flavorsome medley of lighter malt shades. The brightness of the dried plum and red licorice esters mirrors that of the restraint. Gooey base of melted fudge pillars the hefty maltiness while bitter notes of burnt cocoa and dark chocolate underscore the richness and echo the beautifully understated caramelized oak undertow. Alcohol is clean and virtually undetectable. Dazzling interplay between the metallic malt bite and subtle tannins which lightly tingle the palate. Despite the presence of tannins, the barrel extractives are in synch with the malt and esters. Well-developed cakey malt forms an alliance with a fudgelike tackiness before closing with a dryish cocoa, charcoal, and minty alcohol flourish. This is a finessed malt bomb. Quite exquisite.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

The icky sticky semi-sweet bourbon with the wonderfully resinous and charred barrel notes, or the thick, viscous and smooth texture that lingers on the tongue?  I had Older Viscosity a few months back, it was heavy with the sweet, sugar maple bourbon, and while it was really good, I genuinely enjoyed it, I like this one more (though Older Viscosity did look better, so it scores a point higher)... its the tannic, dry nature, the charred wood, its like you can taste the lip of the barrel.

Roasty, dark, sweet malt aroma, with appetizing notes of chocolate truffle, plummy fruit, lightly smoky wood, maple sugar and very faint bourbon, along with some background coffee and slight medicinal alcohol.  Now this stuff really is the color and consistency of well-used motor oil, there have been other brews to cross my path and lay that claim and theyve fallen short, but not this one.  Head fades to nothingness after a short period, while the bottom of the bottle is coated with sediment after the pour.  Flavor profile is dark and roasty to start, becoming sweeter and blended with berryish fruit and licorice, finishing with a blend of earthy bitterness, slight bourbon, aged wood, toffee, gentle but insistent alcohol and lingering espresso.

The smell is big and get bigger as it warms - caramel malts, raisins, figs, some dark chocolate, brown sugar and licorice.  On top of this is the hint of oak and booze in the background that burns the nose ever so slightly.  Taste is a slightly harsher version of the aroma with a big roasted character on top of the malt background and dark fruit flavors. Coffee and chocolate are present as well. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation and fairly dry in the finish.  Drikability is slightly limited by the harsher character of the taste.

Taste is dark dry roast, dark chocolate and a hoppy finish hiding behind all the flavorful roast.  Perhaps the mildest twinge of bourbony flavor, but it melds so well with the other flavors that I wouldnt even know its a bourbon beer.  A nice light dry oak characteristic in the end as well.

2668,"2008-03-25",3.5,"Announcing itself with machismo  Definitely not your dads wimpy 30 weight  Old Viscosity lives up to the preamble oozing like crude oil out of the bottle. A thin tan ring is all I can muster out of this brute. The nose incongruously breathes of light spices and shockingly subtle tonalities. Hints of armagnac, mint, ginger, and root beer extract are apparent while toffee and maple syrup add a raw malty sweetness. Plums and prunes also lend depth to the aroma but arent quite balanced. Though certainly viscous, the mouthfeel isnt as dense as the color suggests. Dark chocolate and coffee, the habitual Imperial Stout duo, here combine with fruity undertones. Banana, blackcurrant, raisin and grape are particularly noticeable. The root beer aroma turns to cola on the tongue and walnuts are a welcome treat. The carbonation is hesitant, unable to overcome its tenacious milieu. Finally, the thick texture itself concedes to alcoholic heat in the aftertaste, though almondy flavors sweeten the compromise. Despite obvious potential, the complexities of this brew remain muted throughout the experience. Where they could have been emphasized, these subtle flavors disappear capitulating perhaps to the virile intentions of the brewers.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Luscious notes of brownies, fresh coffee and barrel aging lead into a pleasant finish.  Wow - this is one for the books.  Originality is an understatement for this brewery.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

I get the opportunity to try this thanks to Taynor, thanks again Dana. The name fits. Old Viscosity pours like motor oil into my snifter. A creamy tan head grew to three fingers as I poured. The head falls to a half finger cap and leaves tremendous lacing on its way down, totally caking the glass. I dont think this beer could look any better than it does.

As this beer warms the aroma intensifies greatly. Mostly dark fruit upfront with a sprinkling of sweet vanilla that Im guessing is from the barrel ageing. Molasses and highly roasted malts shine through. I wasnt very appreciative of the smell of the bat but warming worked wonders.

Flavor follows closely to what I mentioned was in the smell. Theres a touch of coffee like bitterness on the backend along with a noticeable alcohol presence. The roasty dark malts show up in a big way along with super dark chocolate. This ends up being a damn tasty brew.

Thick viscous body. The carbonation is on the lower end of the spectrum but there is enough to keep things moving.

This is without a doubt a sipper. Easy drinking but a beer to end the night with. Ive been on this bottle for over an hour and the complexity keeps growing. 

Another good beer from Port Brewing. They seem to constantly come up with quality brews. This does seem to be a hybrid style ale leaning more toward a porter than an imperial stout.

There are some good flavors in here, but kinda feels like a stout with a shot of whisky in it.   Drinkable in smaller doses.

Aroma is lightly bitter and forcefully sweet, with caramelized sugar and butter, maple, honey, and strawberries; hints of charred blonde brownies, apple peel, caramel and hazelnut latte.  Mildly roasty, with bold and even dimensions of malt, but almost overpowering in sweetness.  Flavor has a very soft and savory bourbon presence of vanilla, pineapple and toasted coconut, offset by a balanced bitterness of acerbic berry skins and roasted espresso.  Thin sweetness of honey and sugar water hollows out the mid palate, leading to a searing hop bitterness of cascade and plastic like wood tones.  Very smooth in the mouth, soft and milky, with mild carbonation; medium to full bodied, and slightly loose.  Hint of cinnamon and Mexican chocolate with more bourbon and pineapple in the finish; long, but laid back, and still very sweet.  Whimpers of coffee and dirty earth acridity linger throughout.

Somewhat underwhelming aroma of chocolate, roasted grain, dry earthy oak with a bit of tannins. The flavor definitely a more assertive punch than the aroma. Bittersweet chocolate, roasted espresso, oak, and vanilla. Then the flavor gets a bit boozy with a burn in the back of the throat and finishes dry with a big roasted malt and hop bitterness. I found the body to be almost harshly carbonated with a extreme amounts of heat and drying bitterness. Overall its a big, rough RIS style beer, definitely big in flavor. I found it had a bit too rough and unpolished flavor at this point. Perhaps more age will smooth it out.

Addendum: Just poured the last bit out and must have gotten a big chunk of yeast cake. The mouthfell has gotten really thick and chewy ans the burn has been quelled somewhat. Almost like what happens to Dark Lord once you pour the sediment.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","jasonm"

As the vapors enter my nose I feel bombarded by single malt scotch and espresso, while milk chocolate makes a much less violent foray into my senses, slapping feebly at my olfactory faculties. The hairs therein struggle to remain unsinged by this roasted malt powerhouse. 

Coffee inundates my tongue, flanked by dark chocolate and another regiment of roasted coffee beans. Alcohol fires warning shots across my palate but never mounts a serious offensive. 

Mouthfeel is sublime, small bubbles march across the entrance to my alimentary tract, providing support and cover for the tank battalion that is this beers taste.

Roastiness level is medium relative to the style (unofficially imperial stout to me).  Very chewy.  More floury chocolate notes as it warms-up.  A touch of smoke.  A little red liquorice on the comeback.  So far so good but where this beer goes from very good to excellence is in the hop department.  Intensely hopped, very resinous and strong bitterness.

The aroma is intensely rich and roasty.  Dark chocolate, nougat, dark cherries, and figs all play huge roles.  Moderate earthy hops are present, though the roast tends to drown them out a bit.  I swear I pick up some bourbon in this version, though its probably just the alcoholic fumes blending with the caramel and nougat.  The flavor is incredibly rich and chewy, with chocolate, caramel, nougat, and oak fighting one another for top billing.

S: This is an incredibly complex aroma. Im not sure I even know where to start. It is very apparent that some of this beer has seen the inside of a bourbon barrel. That is the primary aroma I smell here; sweet oaky bourbon. That is followed up by raisins, chocolate, and caramel. Reminds me a bit of World Wide Stout or some kind of strong Old Ale.

T: Again, the oak and bourbon are right up front. This is a very boozy tasting beer. There are raisins and a touch of burnt something. The flavor fades into dark cocoa. In short, the flavor is very sweet and fairly boozy.

M: Nice medium heavy body with good smoothness. Many times Id associate a beer this oaky with a thinner body, but this one is nice.

D: Im gonna let a couple more of these age and try them in a while. It seems to me like theyll get better.","Troy, New York, USA","drseamus"

2668,"2007-12-24",3.4,"UPDATED: OCT 22, 2008 Fresh bottle.

Pours deep black, thick as the name and byline indicates. Small tan head. Strong vanilla bourbon nose, hot with alcohol, plenty of cherry and some plum, hints of chocolate. The flavor is much as expected from the nose, maybe slighty sweeter and slightly hotter even, alcohol burning up into the sinuses, strong sweet vanilla bourbon following, raisins and dried fruit, dark but definitely not the roastiness of the imperial stouts to which so many reviewers compare this beer. 

Its very good, hits its stride as it nears room temperature (despite what that does to bring out an over-abundance of bourbon vapors), and it gets better as one gets further into the bottle (10% abv helps there, no doubt). Ive enjoyed both bombers Ive had. Still, I think this one needs a couple of years in the cellar to reach its peak. I look forward to doing the experiment. The 3.8 Ive given it here is a hard-ass rating; I think it can climb to 4.something easily with some cellar time.

On a revisit of an ’07 bottle Oct ’08, I have no idea why I liked this beer. Basically this time around, it’s crap (LA/PB fanboy that I am notwithstanding). Burnt bitter coffee and way too hot and alcoholic, sticky and largely unpleasant. Yikes. Serious disappointment. I’d go about 7/4/6/3/11 =3.1 and that would be generous. I’m shading my rating in that direction accordingly.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Ok and now for the flavors... just ridiculous and over the top maltiness with a nice rich sweet molasses/brown sugariness.

More subtle flavors of wood, caramel, and dark fruit come to mind as well. It has a real oily viscous feel to it on the palate with a nice big mouthfeel. The finish has a bitter kick from some hops and the bourbon, but is really smooth all the way down. This is definitely a big beer to be sipped on as you can feel the alcohol warmth all the way down.

This is not a far step away from hoppier imperial stouts like Smuttynose that are alcohol and bruising hops forward but adds pleasant complexity with wood, tobacco, and more bourbon.  Finishes long and boozy with a late and somewhat harsh kick of alcohol.  Glorious.  This is significant because I dont usually note bourbon flavors in these barrel aged beers.  Im also a bit confused because my label says aged in bourbon barrels but the label pictured here does not - but it definitely says Old Viscosity, not Older.

While at first pour its opacity is almost shockingly evident, its not at all heavy or overbreaing on the palate. Instead, what one finds is a fruity, malty, smoky beer with just a touch of the fairly high alcohol on the finish.

2668,"2007-08-07",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2010 My Bottom Line:
Eloquent caramel malts display a blueberry port wine musicality through a portly roasty and resinous tuba. Be careful though, cuz this most generous and jazzy Imperial Stout is pregnant with a Barley Wine.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam slowly hides into the dark brown-sleeved blackness.
-The finish is a seamless union of roasted malt bitterness and wooden hop resins.
-Vanilla spiciness accompanies the caramel malts and well-integrated alcohol heat.
-This started out excellent at cellar temperature (10 degrees Celsius), and improved to greater heights upon travelling to room temperature.
-The soft prickliness is a little too much at first, but later on gets quieter, letting the malty glory express itself.

The taste was beautiful, both up front with some floral notes and hops coming through and in the back with the toasted coffee beans and chocolate notes having their way.

2668,"2007-08-01",4.0,"Dark, oily, molasses, kind of aroma. Reminiscent of Harviestoun Old Engine Oil. Nearly opaque brown/black color with a tan head that rapidly ringed. Medium to full bodied with creamy carbonation. The flavors are disparate, but the alcohol heat is noticeable. There is dark toasted malt, coffee, cocoa, molasses, really overripe dark fruit, mouth puckering, enough bitter to balance the sweetness, at least mostly balance. There might be some cherry notes. This stuff gets thicker as you drink it. The finish is like oiliness that adheres to the mouth. It really sticks with you at the end - mostly bitter with some molasses. Quite complicated.

The brew itself is chewy and oily on the mouth, and issues wonderful chocolate mocha flavors laced with dry coffee, figs and brown sugar.  There is a drying hoppy presence which adds wonderful balance and substantial character to an already complex brew.

Runs through a tonne of dark fruits with significant acidity and finishes blazingly hot with lots of, you guessed it, bourbon.  Maple sugar starts to come through in the aroma eventually, but both the flavour and aroma are way too hot and sharp.  As it warms, liquorice comes on strong.

6/8/2007 - Its easy to joke about Californias chronic social problems.  Pollution, political radicalism, celebrity scandals  its a state rife with publishable ailments, but its contribution to the development of American cuisine is undeniable.  Ancillary to that is the brewing scene.  It may not get lavished with the same media praise and book deals as the gourmet side of things (indeed, it lacks the charismatic faces of such celebrity chefs as Alice Waters and Wolfgang Puck) but it is still undeniably a cultural force on the American brewing scene.  A few breweries stand out above the others.  In this case, behind the fecund flavored Old Viscosity is the eminent Lost Abbey brewery.  Old Viscosity is an example of a beer that is very good without being very pretentious.  The nose is straightforwardly coffee with fine touches of soy, teriyaki and cream.  The taste is equally direct, educing licorice, raisin and a black currant finish.  With the two tiered aroma-taste profile the Old Viscosity is something of a double experience.  The flavors and scents really never change, either with the slow crawl to room temperature or the time on the tongue.  Instead it is a straight delivery of tasty entertainment, both sophisticated enough for the snootiest parvenus palate and consistent enough for the casual drinker.  My only reservation is in the mouth feel which, despite the array of heavy hitting tastes remains thin, akin to melted candy in the mouth.  Still, this beer, its head like foamed chocolate milk, is very much in the Californian spirit.  It does its job with flare, but not with arrogance.  Call it festive, call it extroverted, but above all, call it candid.  Old Viscosity is deep, dark and rich without the fuss over meddling details.  If thats the sort of beer you need for your needs, then by all means find yourself a bottle.  Did I expect something more ornate?  Certainly.  But I wasnt sad to find a beer with enough confidence to burst with flavor without a registered and professional beer taster in the vicinity. (3.5)","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

2668,"2007-06-02",4.0,"22 oz bottle, via Dickinsonbeer.  Pours an unexpectedly dark brown, almost black colored body under a smallish brown head that left some spotty lacing.  Aroma is a mix of dark fruits, roast, slight coffee, a little alcohol, raisins, and a little chocolate.  The flavor is pretty eclectic.  Roast, chocolate, dark berries, moderate alcohol, some caramel, a little coffee, and a fair amount of hoppiness.  The finish shows the alcohol a little more the closer it got to room temperature.  Mouthfeel was indeed quite viscous and full bodied with a slight stickiness.  The carbonation was maybe a bit too much for this one, but it wasnt overly distracting.

Taste: The semi-sweet taste is an engaging mixture of black licorice, molasses, and cold coffee that would evoke thoughts of an imperial-strength root beer if it werent for the ever-increasing roasted bitterness and hints of alcohol. Also, theres those far-off cherries carrying over from the aroma.

Beutiful deep tan, almost brown color on that head.  Smells malty and chocolatey, tastes smooth, too smooth, too cold, should have left it out longer before pouring.  Still, chocolate flavors, hints of fruits, especially cherries, without actually tasting fruity.  Pleasant hop balance, tastes mild but they probably used a lot of hops to balance all the maltiness.  As it warms up Im getting some citrusy sourness on the finish, espresso, dried cherry.  The body is full and round but its not excessively viscous, despite the name.

2668,"2007-04-10",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 19, 2007 4/10/07: Dark, unlying sweetness, hidden alcohol, strong roasted malts..great with cheese.  Tried this beer cold, and then waited 30 minutes warming to room temperature and it became much better.  I think sharp beers are much better served on tap or after warming up, letting some of the carbonation burn off.  The bite of carbonation and dark roasted grains is just too much, and needs either aging and sitting.  My opinion of old viscosity changes from ""love it"" to eh, to eh, to like it.  Wonderful underlying sweetness that is hard to notice at first.  Its also much better half way through the glass as your taste buds get used to it.  Drink later in a group of tastings.

Flavor abounds in sweet notes of black licorice, anise, blackstrap molasses, brandy soaked fruit cake, figs, raisins and plums.

The alcohol is a bit too present at first (something that obviously may change with age) but the chocolate is booming, Jack.

2668,"2007-03-13",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2009 Bottle thanks to Zug4abby. I shared this with the TN crew in Knoxville.

Thick, earthy,  and milky texture and mouthfeel. Very soft carbonation. Flavors of raisens, maple syrup, chocolate,vanilla all shine through as the beer warms.

2668,"2007-03-13",4.0,"Sampled February 2007
As I pour this brew a mix of rum, molasses, Madeira, rum, and sweetened espresso greets my nose.  The beer pours with a thin, light brown head and a pitch black body that shows a clear, deep chocolate brown color when I hold the stream of cascading liquid from the bottle up to the light.  The head disappears fairly quickly, which is not unexpected from a brew of this strength.  Big aromatic notes of chocolate, roasted malt, coffee beans, malt balls jump out of the glass.  I cant believe how much dark chocolate character is packed into this brew.  A nice toasted biscuit character is found here that also tends to accentuate the chocolate character in some way.  Alcohol is evident in the aromatic finish, but never really detracts, instead add a bit of almost balancing sharpness and even, dare I think it, a bit of blackened cherry like fruitiness.  It has a huge dark malt driven aroma, but without all that harsh, burnt, acrid, astringent, grain husk character that is found in many dark malt character brews.  The malt aromatics come across as being so smooth and enticing.  The aroma is like an espresso soaked, rich, flourless dark chocolate cake; decadent, rich, satiating and smooth, I cant wait for my first bite, err, I mean sip.

Nice and creamy feeling up front, yet still not too heavy or sticky on the palate.  That huge, smooth, dark chocolate character is certainly found up front, but the roast / burnt grain character really is much more noticeable in the flavor.  Black, approaching acrid, dark roasted espresso notes finish this beer off with the corresponding burnt acidity and sharp black coffee notes one would expect of a typical Imperial Stout.  While these notes do not go away, they certainly become a bit more smooth and in control after the first bit of palate shock.  The flavor of this beer remains so smooth and chocolate-like up front, yet somehow manages to morph by the finish to a dark, concentrated, even almost unsweetened espresso drink by the finish.  I cant help but wonder if this is a good or bad thing.  On the one hand the up front, smooth character is so enticing that you want to hang on to it for as long as possible.  Too quickly though the rough, burley espresso notes take hold, and in the end beg for you to balance that lingeringly, astringent burnt character out by taking another sip so you can experience that smooth Imperialistic, hearty stout goodness again.  Of course the cycle then starts all over again.  What a dynamic brew, the dichotomy is such an interesting experience.  Is this what I want in a brew?  I dont know, but it is certainly an enjoyable ride.

That fact that this brew can be so easy drinking, yet so (in a balancing way really) sharp and, dare I think it, harsh makes this such an engaging experience.  This beer could certainly survive a lot of years in the cellar.  There is an ample hop bitterness here, that while secondary to the roast malt character, is no slouch in its own right.  Also there is a sharp alcohol note that adds a bit of a ""shot of rum"" type kick to the finish that can only smooth out a bit with time.  In fact the finish at times seems to down-right suck because it  can be so harsh.

Ultimately this beer is such the consummate sipping brew.  The combination of rich chocolate, creamy malt character up front and the sharp, roast dominated character in the finish makes for a brew that just cant be quaffed.  This is despite the fact that this is certainly not the biggest bodied of Imperial Stouts (though it is certainly no slouch either).  I still havent quite figured out what to think of this brew.  I am only part way through my first glass of this brew.  In the end it is so dynamic and engaging that I cant help but be excited with this brew.  There are a lot of things ""wrong"" with this beer, but they somehow add up to a totality of an experience that I cant really knock it in the end.   The aroma says this brew is magnificent, while the flavors, taken as individual components say this is a train-wreck, but in the end this dichotomous flavor profile just works as a total experience, or better yet it is a roller coaster, which just has to be experienced.  Part of the experience of this brew for me is that I cant quite place this brew; is this brew a jarring train-wreck of flavors, or is it an absolutely stunningly awesome brew because of it flaws?  I still cant quite answer the question, but the experience has been so engaging and thought provoking that I just cant help but love this beer.

Bottle from Mondo Vino, Denver. Pours near black. Aroma is vanilla, erath, dark chocolate, raisins. The palate is medium heavy and malty. Lots of wood character is on this one.

The head looks like caramel on a low boil. Very pleasant aroma of raisins, malt and some alcohol.  Flavor is a touch of roasted malt, lots of raisins, and sherry.

2668,"2007-02-12",3.7,"A very tasty and different beer from Pizza Port. The pour would lead you to believe it was a stout. Thick and dark black with  small cherry head that doesnt stick around. Aroma is mostly alcohol with a little malt. At first sip you notice not much carbonation and a thick chewy feel. The burnt flavor is present throughout with an alcohol burn after swallow.

Dark woodsy sherry, rich chocolates, sweet earthy plums that leave the flavor uniquely fruity.  Notes of roasty charcoal chocolate.  The palate is rich, creamy, vinous, and moderately full-bodied.

2668,"2007-01-25",3.5,"2006 bomber shared with SuIIy on 1/18/07Dark, near-black body shows a bit of dark mahogany on the edges.  Medium tan head is only one-finger high and recedes somewhat quickly to partial cover.Kind of odd, you usually get better retention from PP (though this is the first stout/barleywine sort of beer Ive had from them so what do I know).  The head can be coaxed up again with swirling, but never remains long.  Little/no lacing to be had either.  Clarity is medium; despite my best efforts to leave the thick layer of sediment at the bottom, the beer is just dark and thick.A delayed onset of slightly fruity, rather bitter and citric hops allows time for grudgingly sweet malt notes to waft up.  Dark chocolate brushed with light char and almost creamy-sweet milk chocolate notes combine with a fine balancing act as a hint of cherry-vanilla can be found as well.  Green, juicy but also rather heavily bitter hops finally come and soak in to the malt well.  Interesting combinations of fruit (cherry, orange, apple), heavy pine/citrus and chocolatey-sweet malts produce a fairly domineering, but interesting aroma.  A bit of ashiness dries things out on the very end, with notes of bitter cocoa, but enough residual sweetness makes it easily bearable.  Medium-high strength of aroma, quite sniffable, but the hops sure give a big jolt initially.  Dosent seem very focused and Id be surprised if the brewers intentions were to toss a bunch of fruity and bitter hops in to different dark malts and lots of base malt and see what happened.  But regardless, the overall excellence of brewing at Pizza Port wins out and no flaws or any real problems are encountered.  Little to no alcohol heat in the nose relative to its strength, maybe a touch of dry vapors after warming.Not quite as sweet to begin the flavor, a lightly gritty dark malt character scrapes at the palate lightly, while cigars, cherries, dry cocoa and vanilla all explode in every which way.  Residual sugars do catch up and soften the texture a good deal, whle providing some creamy sweetness that is much needed, as the hops are very bitter and challenging.  Citrus and light pine, quite dry and strong attempt to overwhelm the malt balance.  Much of the acidity is soaked up, but some is left in excess and bites at the palate.  Char reprise on the finish, with plenty of hops (bitterness and flavor) and light caramel breadiness.  With warming, I find a lot of cherry and vanilla, quite enjoyably so, but the hop wallop fatigues the palate and dosent seem to die down.  Alcohol rather apparent by the end.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The aroma is a mixture of chocolates, dark fruits, a warming alcohol smell, and many other things can be detected.  Very smooth and full bodied palate that is thick and coats the mouth with every sip.

2668,"2007-01-11",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 2, 2007 Opaque black pour, quickly diminishing tan head. A little oily looking. A second glance reveals beautiful colors, actually a dark mahogany with polished cherry wood hues, nice. Bourbon soaked, smoked out oaken barrels come to life at the first aroma, wafting scents of raisins, chocolate, light vanilla, dark berries. Alcohol is very evident, but complimentary to the structure. First sip yields a very viscous palate with a gargantuan body. Flavor is at first heavy roasted malts, then lighter vanilla, light chocolate cake with sugary icing, slight caramel malts that start to shine at warmer temps, and crushed dark fruits. I really get tons of depth with this beer. Palate becomes very sticky, bordering on qualities of vintage Noval port. The carbonation is higher than I prefer is this style, but just brings a thought that this is a very lively strong ale probably up to the task of spending many years in my cellar. Lacing left behind now is spotty, minimal, probably due to the oily and vinous consistency. The taste finishes with a very satisfying roastiness, all malt. The roastiness is unique, as heavy as a robust American imperial stout but so much more relaxed and invigorating. Fantastic experiment.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

9/11/07, with holdenn.

First batch (aged 1 year) 22oz bottle, pours black with very small tan head that quickly turned to having no head. nose is really bourbony (i thought this wasnt portion bourbon aged), rich caramel, and licorice. a really complex nose. flavor notes of chocolate, caramel, burnt roasty character, with a subtle bourbony and alcohol finish. 8/3/7/4/14 = 3.6  22oz portion barrel aged 2007, pours black with creamy tan head. nose is bready, nuts, and bakers chocolate. flavor is chocolatey, lots of dark fruits, caramel, subtle alcohol burn, and nutty. mouth feel is pretty creamy. carbonation is smooth. flavor just doesnt seem very complex, and surprising that this was the least bourbon flavor of the 3...7/4/7/4/15 = 3.7.  The 3 beers were surprisingly very different. Id like to age the first batch another year and maybe it wont feel so hot and harsh. The 2007 vintage could use a year or two to develop some complexity of its own and maybe the chocolate and bourbon notes will come out more. overall, this beers score took a big drop from previous rating and i feel its appropriate to use the score of the fresher 2007 vintage.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

There is not much head but the beer coats the glassware with a VERY OILY UNFILTERED film hence the name of the brew methinks. The nose is very much in the traditional olde English Vintage Ales with a heavy oxidized character along with a plum cake aroma topped by non-aromatic pipe tobacco, sea salt, bakers chocolate, vanilla bean, fine Indian washed coffee, and just a wonderful finishing earthy, smoky and dusty ester...Oh heck yeah baby!!! The taste is a tad hotter than I would wish but the nutty, olde hop, cellar and dusty nature of a fine olde ale shines though never the less. Fruity and round throughout with a tribute to those damn canned fruit cakes nobody wants for Christmas. In the end a strangely unique dry, chalky, and powered spice undertone leads the drinker off into a visions of flight of fantasy. The mouth feel is once again a reminder of the moniker, oily and heavy for sure, the thickness near 2004 Dark Lord weight...I really dig this brew and hope that aging will temper the hotness without making it taste ""too old"".

Thanks to Facto for breaking this one out at the end of the night.  Before getting to the last of the brett or barrel aged beers I needed one last thing to prep the palate.  This did the job admirably though I am not sure why it is called an American Strong Ale.  It seems more like a stout to me, but either way it is an excellent choice.
Aroma / Appearance - The nose reminds me of a sherry with notes of cherry, malt, honey and oak.  The pour resulted in a deep black body with clear lacing and almost no head.  From the appearance you would not peg this as a strong ale (at least, I wouldnt).
Flavor / Palate - The flavor is stoutlike - smoky and malty with a sharp aftertaste.  If it were an imperial stout it would be on the thin side but for this style it is perfect.  The second and third sips added caramel, coffee, yeast and white bread to the other tastes.  The aftertaste was so nice I would have savored it for a while if not for the next set of beers being opened.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

I would classify this personally as an imperial stout.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
2668,"2006-12-05",3.7,"Mmm, pours a wonderful looking deep dark brown.  Aroma opens up a lot vaguer than I expected, but I got a  bit of roast and chocolate from it.  Luckily, the taste packed a punch; very roasty right away, followed by some caramel sweetness, and some slightly soured pear flavors.  Coffee bean aftertaste.  Subsequent sips show signs of liquorice.  Beer seemed a little hot, but overall was a very good strong ale.

2668,"2006-12-02",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2007 Tap at PP Solana Beach.  Pitch black, dark brown head.  Chewy sweet aroma, resin, plums, toasted malts and roasted grain.  There is a touch of licorice and coffee as well.  The flavour is incredibly roasty.  There are also loads of intense sweet chewy malts.  Sticky and plummy gives it the character of a Christmas pudding, but rather than remaining sweet, the palate is cleansed by massive levels of roasted barley.  The roast seems to be doing a better job of balancing this than the hops, although it doesnt lack these either.  Sort of a straightforward example of a big roasty imperial stout, but its a well-made version.

Dark brown beer, thin tan head.  Aroma is very sweet and chocolatey.  Dark bittersweet chocolate, caramel and sweet peppery notes.  Flavour is also very dark and chocolatey.  Earthy and slightly dusty with heavy roasty finish.

Pour of chocolate centered sienna, with orangey glowing fringes and a rim of whitish. Flavor a hybridization of sweet currant malts, heavy cold sweet cream, with a big estery pear, almond  and toasted date and walnut bread, with edges of molasses and melted raw sugar. Starts with the dark intro of an imperial stout, but with a full of dark bourbon notes, before hitting balance with an edge of dryness, then falling into a mellow refined fruit of barleywine type character. Nice oaky char, crispy barbeque crust and fading edges of light hop cones bring balance.  Expressive all around. Really amazingly delicious with a rich deep sugar content in the malt. Edges of hop bring balance, but acerbic light coffee liquer and candy help too. This is such a unique offering, for walking so many style lines.

There are early subtle suggestions of chocolate  or roasty espresso, but any type of flavor, character or level of complexiy is masked by a harsh, almost vodka like alcohol dominance.

Aromas of toasted nutty grain, raisins, molasses, licorice and burnt chocolate, oaky, and floral hops that mingles with the alcohol. 

Good, moderate carbonation and a crisp, alcohol laced, creamy smooth fullish-medium bodied mouthfeel, a definite sipper.

Delicious tasting and dangerously quaffable, raisins, nutty and grainy, a roasted, burnt chocolate malty bitterness, a touch of molasses, floral, spicy hops, a nice vanilla barrelness, the alcohol is there, but blends with the other flavors, warming in the palate and a dryish, roasted malty finish with a little sweet fruity alcohol lingering in the palate.

Pours to a dark, opaque brown body with a medium dark tan colored head that retains well, maintaining a good 1/4in or so almost throughout my sampling.  The aroma shows some roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruit - almost a combination of raisins, plums, and dates but its clearly different from the raisins one might smell coming from a belgian double - and hints of alcohol.  I should note here that my observations were made in a smoky bar so my aroma notes and/or rating may not be entirely accurate.  The taste shows dark roasted malts, chocolate, and strong vanilla presence that seems to indicate barrel aging, potentially in an american bourbon barrel(?) which might account for the clear presence of oak tannins, vanilla, charred wood, and a definite bourbon-alcohol taste.  Upon further sips and once I get past the alcohol flavors, the hops come out from hiding and it seems to me like this one must have been quite hoppy when it was young, possibly a beer similar to three floyds alpha klaus, though higher in alcohol and barrel aged.

2668,"2006-09-13",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2006 On tap @ the Port Brewing Company Brunch 09/09/06:  As others have said, this stuff looks super thick, thus the name.  Surprisingly, the aroma and mouthfeel were much different.  As someone else said, it had aromas of molassas & fruit.   As stated, it was rather light on the tounge, but definitely packs a wallop.  I believe the actual ABV is 10%, not 12% as stated on this page description.   Still, I can see getting completely hammered on this stuff quickly.  I dont really know what category this beer falls into - I overheard someone say it was like a stout and a barleywine mixed together.  Sounds about right.   Excellent.","Poway, California, USA","Naven"

2668,"2006-09-12",3.5,"22oz. bomber from Port Brewing. The bottle says 10% abv so this may be a slightly different beer. Pours fizzy and cola like with a head that quickly disappeared. Sweet woody caramel aroma. Sweet, fruity and alcoholic in flavor with cocoa and caramel notes. Finishes acrid and with a balanced bitterness and drier than the upfront flavor would suggest. As it warms, a really interesting tropical fruit flavor comes out.  Fairly straight ahead but nice.","austin, Texas, USA","biz82"

2668,"2006-08-11",3.7,"Bottle: Muddy brown, nice nose of dusty fermenting grapes and dimetab with an almost chocolately malt background.

2668,"2006-06-28",4.6,"This is a tremendous, mastadonic behemouth of a brew.  Pours like tar with a scungy brown head.  When you look at the side of the head, there is an odd effect - a water (beer) fall of brown muck dripping down the side of the head as it disappates.  Have not seen that before.

Nose is intense chocolate coffee with a hint of smoke and licorice.  Mouthfeel is rich but not syrupy, and flavor is nutty charcoal and burnt marshmallows.  I love this beer!

2668,"2006-06-01",4.4,"Growler from Port s San Marcos brewery. Very dark brown pour. Head the color of coffee with just a splash of cream. Thin, sticky lacing that glides slowly down the glass after each tilt. Nose is all sourdough bread with a little underlying cherries and malty sweet molasses. Lots of small bubbles, but with a surprisingly watery feel to it, but not in a bad way. Results in a very downable high-alcohol brew.  I cant get over the yeasty bread smell in the nose as it warms in the glass. A little raisiny-coffee-chocolate roast combo in the malts. No shocker there for the style, but still very pleasing. Just a hint of balsamic flavor there as well.  Less alcohol in the finish then expected, a little dry. Really a nice experience overall.","San Diego, California, USA","bindpmc"
2668,"2006-05-02",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 22, 2015 Bottle.

Head is initially huge, frothy/creamy, brown, fully lasting.
Body is dark brown to black (almost opaque, flashlight tested), bottle conditioned.

Aroma is moderately to heavily malty (roasted grain/nuts, dark chocolate/fudge, coffee, caramel), lightly hoppy (apricot, flowers), with notes of vanilla, alcohol, oak, cake/frosting, whisky.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic.

This has long been one of the few Port / Lost Abbey / Whatever beers that has remained very solid and enjoyable.  Enormous lasting head and effectively opaque body makes for a great start.  Enticing, varied aroma is a delight to sniff.  And the flavor balance works quite well too...neither too sweet nor bitter.  Nice fluffy mouthfeel without too much alcohol burn completes the picture.  Its not quiet an OMG beer but its not far from that...excels in all respects.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2668,"2006-04-19",4.4,"Sampled at the 4th Boulder Strong Ale Fest. The beer poured a nearly opaque, dark brown color with a trace, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing head. The aroma was malty with heavy notes of roasted grain, cookie and caramel, moderate notes of toasted nuts, molasses, chocolate and coffee; hoppy with a light note of herbs; yeasty with light notes of cellar; moderate notes of vanilla and moist, lush, fresh banana bread. Nummy! The flavor was heavily bittersweet with a long, moderately sweet, heavily bitter finish. The body was full, the texture was velvety and the carbonation was soft.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","luckygirl"

Hugely aromatic and tasty, with notes of steam room wood, smoke, aged whiskey, bitter chocolate, dark roasted barley, chewy black licorice, charcoal and burnt toast. Strong bitterness definitely cleaned out the sweetness. Very enjoyable beer. RERATE, bomber: Chewy, with lip-smacking sweetness filled with toffee, sugared tar, dark chocolate, toast. Dark fruit and fruity alcohol nips. Chalky texture in the gum-tingling finish, with lingering hop zing and alcohol warmth.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

Wow! What an honor to sample this rarity! Shared w/ Tomme, Dr. Bill and esteemed beer writer Steven B from Toronto. Amazing aroma, very port-like. Deep rich black color, no roastiness, just wonderful malty flavors. Tastes almost like it was wood aged, but it has never touched wood. Lots of fruitiness and vanilla throughout. Tremendous!

2668,"2005-05-03",3.7,"(750 ml bottle: Shared by cquiroga at OBriens) What a special treat to get to try this rarity.  I have no idea how old the bottle is, but the label design was copyrighted by Jeff Bagby in 2001.  Earthy, dark malts, some roast, moderately bitter.  Sticky palate and full bodied.  Moderately fruity and sweet nose, with some earthy and malty notes.  Nearly black in color, so not your dads wimpy 30 weight indeed!  Small light tan head that fades away to a small ring.  Possibly past its peak, but still damn good.  I just wish I had this beer first and not at the end of a long tasting session at OBriens with the Ratebeer guys.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

2668,"2004-08-29",4.2,"8/28/04.  Poured out of 750 mL botlte, sampled at Dr. Bill and Steinys 8th Annual 12-Hour Beer Festival in Orange, CA 8/28/04.  Oh my god, what a beer.  Im going off of my ratings from yesterday, but I have a hard time saying that I didnt UNDERrate this beer.  Here goes: Pours a deep dark brown-red, very thick.  Dense, fluffy tan carbonation that is simply outstanding.  Superbly lasting lacing, and the most amazing ""reverse lacing"" Ive ever seen on a beer.  When you tilt your glass, not only do you see a shimmering cascade of tight carbonation bubbles slowly trickling down the side of the glass, but also a rising sheet of bubbles on the opposite side of the glass, tracing the beer up from beneath the surface.  Its hard to explain.  But its unbelieveable.  If I could give the beer something higher than a 5 for appearance, Id have no problem giving it a 6, 7, or 8.  Aroma of sweet malt and faint dark chocolate.  Good round malt flavor, a nice mix of dark and mellow malts, cocoa, and a bit of dark berry, fruity flavors.  Very nicely rounded.  Hugely viscous, awesomely full body.  So the flavor is a bit of a disappointment but still pleasant.  When will they brew this again?  I just want to  LOOK at it.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

2668,"2003-02-02",4.4,"Bottled version from 2001. This is one of my favorites. I wish I had bought many bottles at the Strong Ale Festival when I had the chance. Poured a nice black (deep dark ruby when lighted from behind) with a moderately thick, tan head that had a rosy tint. Aroma was full of malts, chocolate and a tad vinous. Flavor was full and complex. Full of malt, chocolate, and sweet! Notes of plum, currant, and raison. Light bitterness in the aftertaste. Very full mouthfeel - chewy and fulfilling. Moderate carbonation full of tiny, soft bubbles. Steady throughout the whole bottel - left a thin layer of creamy carbonation during the whole session.

2668,"2002-12-22",3.9,"Very interesting.  When first released very over the top maltiness and alcohol.  Coating like a stout lingering like a barleywine.  Made an apearance 6 months later after being spiked with a bit of rum at the Real ale festival and was all of the above only more mature with a dark sweetness akin to WWS.  and now a year from its premire still exibits vinious malts and alcohol in the nose.  Mouthfeel has thinned out a touch.  Strang but interesting dust/ new snow charactor is starting to move in with a raison tartness and a certain dryness in the finish.  I think this one is just getting past its prime.","Yokosuka, JAPAN","Marc"
2668,"2002-12-12",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 22, 2009 This is no doubt ports best year round, accessible bottled beer.  Its an imperial stout no matter what anyone says, even the brewer. If you can make egg salad out of tofu and call it egg salad, you can make an imperial stout out of whatever the hell this shit is made out of. Fuck, we have better palates than most brewers so their style designation should be taken as a grain of salt. A fine ass imperial stout, better than all the other imperial stouts port puts out combined. At less than $6 for a 22oz, it makes you question reality.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
