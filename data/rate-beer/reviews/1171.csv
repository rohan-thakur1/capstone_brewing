APARIENCIA: de color ámbar, turbia, con una mediana baja actividad de carbonatación, se observan algunos restos de sedimento en el líquido. Corona de espuma color blanco de mediana baja retención, de burbujas compactas y abiertas.

AROMA: de inicio muy herbal, predominantemente dankness, atrás las notas a frutos cítricos y tropicales que se esperan: jugo de uva blanca, lichi, guayaba, melón, papaya, lima. Cuando el líquido toma más temperatura, las características frutales relucen un poco más, pero al agitar la copa vuelve a predominar lo herbal.

SABOR: predominan y explotan los sabores de frutos tropicales, notas a jugo de uva blanca, lichi, guayaba, papaya, melón, mango verde, algo de cítricos como mandarina y cáscara de lima, algo de dankness y pasto recién cortado no tan presente como en aroma, y las maltas como galleta neutra o crackery. El retrogusto queda un amargor medio largo pegado al paladar, algo de gusto verde como pasto y resina queda remanente.

1171,"2016-02-23",3.6,"Poured into a snifter. Big thanks to NizzleEGizzle for hooking me up.

3.25 A: Murky, but ""bright"" orange brown color. Less than a finger of creamy off-white head formed. Retention is well below average given the style. A few scattered wisps of lacing are left behind.

4.5 S: Pretty awesome nose on this. Huge lemongrass right from the start. Grapefruit and pith, orange, touch of lemon. Secondarily floral with coriander and white pepper-esque spiciness. Clean overall, but theres a hint of bready yeastiness. 

3.75 T: While the nose is vibrant, the taste is more subdued. To start, for a DIPA, theres only a very mild bitterness. The hops are almost equally floral and citrusy, while the nose was more citrus forward. Still lots of lemongrass with grapefruit and orange following. Finishes with the same mild spiciness.

3.75 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Theres some creaminess but I could use some more.

4.0 D: Solid beer, but doesnt quite live up to expectations.

1171,"2015-07-31",3.7,"Pours a completely hazy, lovely sun-yellow color, with a big, extremely stable head. 

Smells outstandingly dank, of a flooded backyard with flowers and lemon zest hints randomly added, almost a bit skunky, reminding me of leaf infused herbs. Out of that foundation onion and crispy orange rind are rising up, creating a pleasant, very focussed hop complexity. 

Has a higher carbonation, while the beer provides an enjoyable medium body, which remains refreshing, while featuring a fantastic hop bitterness.

Begins with grassy hops and a decent amount of toast, with lemon blending into that melange. Malts get a tad sweeter, as the lemon turn sun-bathed ripe and juicy, guided by the beers outstanding dankness. Finishes with a pleasant minerality, while the hops turn lemony dry, exhibiting wet grass and even more lime.

Its real hop punch unveils late, while it creates an immense intensity and doesnt leave the palate for a long while. Before that, the brew exhibits a fantastic, soft aqueous mouthfeel, adding to its dank character. The hops arent too diverse in this, while they unfold a fantastic, pungent lime defined punch. The beers high abv isnt noteable at all, as it drinks almost too easy, not providing a particularly huge body, but very convincing and focused in taste.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Nose is an impressive mix of citrus, pine and tropical fruits. Taste is of tangerines, oranges and other citruses. Juicy with cereals taking the back seat and only appearing to make sure it is perfectly balanced (toward hops) and never harsh. Moderately sweet and bitter. Body is medium, carbonation too and mouthfeel is just juicy. Overall an awesome drink, really. Not sure what was off with our bottle but I would drink that all the time! ;)","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
1171,"2015-05-12",4.0,"750mL bottle, pours a cloudy dark golden orange with a small white head. Nose is dank as fuck, with truckloads of juicy pot-like hops. Flavour is actually fairly mellow for a IIPA, with dank citrus hops, a little pine, and biscuity malt. Wonderfully balanced and quite restrained for a double IPA. Smooth and highly drinkable. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

1171,"2015-04-22",4.1,"Bottle, courtesy of a chill br, shared in a location remote of my living room. 
Pours a hazy yellow with a big head and nice lacing on the glass.

The aroma is fruit forward hops, melon, orange, some leafiness. Very low malt character, very pungent, extraordinarily appetizing. 

The flavor has plenty of melon & grapefruit. The hop character is bright, punchy & satisfying. Its nicely bitter, perhaps more so than youre typical nouveau IPA, but it works well here and is more on the medium as opposed to moderate end. The alcohol character is very low.
 
wonderful.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

1171,"2015-04-18",3.9,"Live from NH! Bottle (750 ml). Bottled 06-04-2015. From Jon, thanks! Split 3-ways with Chris and Julien.

Appearance: Cloudy glowing yellow-orange with medium white head and heavy lacing. 

Aroma: Pineapples, piney notes, grass, resin, honeyed notes, doughy malts and light melons.

Taste: Piney, pineapples, moderate honeyed sweetness, grass, resin, doughy malts and moderate bitterness.

Palate: Medium body. Moderate to medium carbonation. Less oily mouthfeel than most trillium. Moderately dry finish. 

Overall: Good DIPA. Doesnt have the Trillium ""essential oils"" kick that theres in most Trillium hoppy beers but its still a tasty and quite easily drinkable DIPA.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

1171,"2015-04-16",3.9,"Pour is a dark amber, extremely hazed, light edges, tight white head that lingers for a little and leaves a thick lacing. Nose has a rich tropical fruit presence, pineapple, peach, light orange citrus, a bit of caramel malt and notes of resin. Body is full and heavy, assertive carb, gets a touch sticky. Some sweet malt backbone, a little sugary, hops are super aggressive, Peach, citrus, faint resin. Finish is fairly bitter and takes away from the clean hop flavors slightly.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"
1171,"2015-04-15",3.4,"Fresh bottle purchased from the brewery and drunk later the night of 4/10/15Pours a rather hazy orange-gold with a very strong, large, well-retained, white head.Beautiful nose has both elements of tropical fruits as well as some more standard orange/grapefruit/pine. Not quite the lush, juicy strength of Upper Case and theres more resin displayed here, which Im never much a fan of, but the alcohol is under control and the malt adds only moderately sweet honey to help balance.The flavor is a mixed bag for me. On one hand, the same luscious tropical fruits are here and provide enjoyable flavors of pineapple, mango and such, but theres a bit of blandness from the hops still in suspension and to go with that, a bit too much pine-like acidity. The brighter, lighter notes are inevitably consumed by the grapefruit/resin bitterness and resulting acidity. That being said, its not outrageously acidic and to be quite honest, as it warmed up, the malt actually became a bit too sweet. Too cake-like and sugary, though I wouldnt go as far as to call it syrupy. Obviously, then, the resulting texture is very soft and coupled with the natural carbonation, makes that part of the experience enjoyable.Kind of an ""Old-style American DIPA"", as in, more bitter/C-hop forward and with plenty of maltiness. Still enjoyable but theres just a better breed of IPA/DIPA being brewed these days (including many of Trilliums other beers).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The taste is light and full of hop fruit flavor. Mango, pineapple, a little papaya, mild tangerine. Good stuff. No real malt sweetness but it is fairly sweet. It makes me think of hoppy beers that stay away from early hop additions. Moderate bitterness in the finish. Solid DIPA.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

1171,"2015-02-22",3.7,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is very hop forward with a light, background malt character. Lots of tropical fruit and citrus with lighter stone fruit and resin. Pineapple mango and guava are most prevalent. 
Pours a cloudy, pale, golden orange with some copper hues and a thick, white head that exhibits nice retention. High lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is somewhat sweet with a slight honey character and some light caramel notes. Rather strong bitterness with a light alcohol spice in the finish. Moderate orange and grapefruit notes with some light stone fruit, especially peach. Moderate tropical fruit with mango being most prevalent. Hints of resin and melon. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice IPA with a lot of tropical and stone fruit. A little sweet and malty for my preferences, but the hop character is nice and works well with the sweetness.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
