3458,"2017-03-13",4.2,"From the bottle at EBF, 2/3/17.Large, light-tan head is very well-retained atop a cola-tinted, dark-mahogany body with good clarity.Coffee beans, spicy bourbon, espresso, vanilla and light fudge comprise the aromatic nose. Notably missing is any bit of alcohol/sharpness or overabundance of roast. I dont even get that much of the typical coconut/pina colada that most strong bourbon stouts exhibit. Light toastiness from the base oak, with just a touch of coconut but its folded in to the chocolate and coffee very nicely.In the mouth, youve got a very dry, wonderfully well-attenuated beer with engaging carbonation, tons of spicy coffee and spice, light barrel tannin and touches of warming coconut-like bourbon liquor. The chocolate-espresso from the malts perfectly balances everything without itself being overbearing. Vanilla, light bourbon, prune-raisin and more chocolate linger long. The finish is not dull and heavy from too much roast/sweetness/alcohol, but rather fruity, spicy and vibrant on account of how dry the beer is. Funky Buddha, it seems, can do no wrong.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Dark chocolate, complex freshly ground coffee & bourbon alcohol. Sweet, bitter, malty & roasty taste. Soft, round, velvety & tiny boozy mouthfeel. Coffee coconut finish. Very heavy on the fresh aromatic coffee & coconut flavourings. Bitterness bugs me a little. While designed to be vulgar it seems too unbalanced.

3458,"2017-02-12",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
Tons of coconut dominate this dessert brews vanilla, coffee and chocolate, as bourbon heat and slick residual sugars build a sturdy enough foundation to support the heavyset decadence.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the blackness.
-Sunscreen allusions are quite hard to avoid.
-This doesnt smell anything like an Imperial Porter.
-This one has the body and wealth to support all the adjuncts, something I cant say about their Maple Bacon Coffee Porter or Last Snow.

The coffee moves in after that and balances out with a light bourbon and a beautiful charred oak that offers the slightest hint of vanilla. This is fantastic. The flavor is much of the same.

Has a fantastic nose, full of roasted coconut, flowery, earthen coffee and a smack of toffee. Offers a hot chocolate quality with lots of melting cream in it, topped off by a slightly spicy, still floral barrel. Very convenient on the nose, with a prominent coconut-coffee interplay.

Drinks creamy soft with a sparkly hint to it, lighter mouthfeel, malty sweet and complex, due to the well integrated barrel and the adjuncts.

Tastes of toffee, earthy coffee with a roasted, dry hint to it, topped off by rock sugar. The barrel adds a warming note to the flavors, enhancing the already established coconut sweetness, together with a flowery note and a spicy bite. A prominent creaminess softens the barrel and brings out rock sugar even more, complimented by a wooden coffee dryness. Finishes with alcohol soaked pralines, fudge, maintaining coffee and a hint of toasty coconut, long and tasty.

Pours a deep, dark, nearly opaque brown with slight amber highlights on the edges and a small tan head that settles into a lasting ring. So the coconut here is gigantic, as most others have mentioned. It surprised me to see it rated so high, even at this early juncture, given that coconut can be a polarizing ingredient. Supporting notes of coffee - which would be a pretty good dose if the coconut werent so forward - cocoa, caramel, toasted brown sugar, and mild warming bourbon throughout. Medium-full bodied, with modest carbonation and a sweet, mildly roasty, but mostly sweet mouthfeel. It has an almost oily texture, but that couldve just been my mind playing with me after one friend winced and said, ""Whoa, sun tan lotion!""

3458,"2015-09-03",4.3,"On tap at Maple Bacon Day. Served in a plastic cup. Originally reviewed 1/10/2015.
Black. Nice khaki head good retention. Looks sticky. 

Lots of coconut in the smell. Sweet caramel. Coffee. Chocolate. Some bourbon, but light.

Barrel shows more in the flavor. Nice whiskey flavor. Coffee and coconut in equal portions. Some oak. Slightly sharp oak. Lots of lactose sweetness in the back end.
Very sweet. Medium heavy. Slightly acidic woody flavor.
This is really excellent. Not quite Morning Wood, but its much better than Snowed In.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

3458,"2015-05-31",4.2,"On tap at the Buddha. Dark brown pour with a mocha head. Sweet caramel and bourbon aromas. Loads of booze with sweet caramels, chocolate, vanilla, and oak notes. A bit thin in the body with a good mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"
3458,"2015-04-21",4.0,"EBF. Pours a deep black with no head and no lacing. It looks ""rich"". Nose is of coffee, slight smoke and coconut. Light on the bourbon flavors but I can appreciate that. Taste is of coffee, coconut, chocolate and lightly sweet. Again, this is not a bourbon-bomb and thats fine. Body is medium-full, carbonation moderate. Mouthfeel is thick and dessert-like. Overall a really solid imperial stout and something Id go for again! Best FB brew so far!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

3458,"2015-04-05",4.1,"EBF.
Pours brown with very low to no brown head. Aroma is of coconut, vanilla, fruits, malt, butterscotch. Taste is of vanilla, coconut, caramel, molasses, brown sugar. Palate: Full bodied, soft carbonation. Overall: Very good. A fine sipper.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","Minderbinder"
3458,"2015-04-01",4.4,"Sample @ EBF.

Appearance: Pitch black with a small bubbly brown head and not much lacing but some alcohol legs.

Aroma: Incredibly decadent! Burst of coconut along bourbon, nuts, lots of chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, super rich malts, oak and vanilla. Wow, so rich and complex!

Taste: Almost as amazing as the aroma. Sweet, but not cloying. Burst of coconut again with bourbon, rich caramel malts, chocolate, biscuity, roasted presence, oak, caramel, vanilla and light bitterness.

Palate: Full body. Soft carbonation. Oily. Massively flavorful finish with a very nice warming (not burning) presence. Coconut - chocolate and roasted malt aftertaste. 

Overall: Extremely flavorful and complex. Favorite beer of EBF. A lot of similarities with Proprietors 14. I love these coconut forward barrel aged RIS.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3458,"2015-03-24",4.3,"Sample at EBF. Oily black pour, no head. Aroma is super rich, tons of coconut, rich caramel, chocolate, bourbon vanilla. Taste is super sweet, really desserty, coconut, Tom says this was like Prop 14 but I disgress, prop 14 was a cinnamon bomb. This is all about vanilla and coconut, milk chocolate flavor. Palate is rich but not too boozy, very slick and oily, palate coating. Very nice.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

3458,"2015-03-15",5.0,"Sample pour at fl brewers guild craft beer day 2015. This is by and far the best BA stout that I have ever had. The taste is as described above, but what really stood out for me was just how smoothly the bourbon rounded the coconut out in the beer.","Apollo Beach, Florida, USA","hoppy2beerhere"
3458,"2015-02-09",5.0,"Had this at Maple Bacon Fest 15 and it was the nightcap. Just WoW.. If you have ever had Last Snow or Snowed In you must try this barrel aged version the Smokey Whiskey flavor is the perfect addition to this beer. If you are lucky enough to be around when they showcase this beer it is a must have.","boca raton, Florida, USA","FunkyBuddaMan"
3458,"2015-01-14",4.7,"Fudge colored pour, tan head. Nose is whiskey, vanilla, coconut, fudge. Taste is the same, sweet but far from cloying, everything melded together seamlessly. Chewy creamy mouthfeel. Man this was good.","","knickskicks"
3458,"2015-01-12",4.5,"Draft at MBCP Day 2015. This is the one that did it for me this day. Just wow! Initially a soft vanilla booziness in the nose followed by coconut and chocolate. Taste is a mix of boozy spirit and coconut; the barrel aging seems to have mellowed out the coconut, which I find to make it more pleasant. a slightly sweet but never cloying mouthfeel. This is a barrel aged Mounds candy bar. Absolutely delicious way to end the day!","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
