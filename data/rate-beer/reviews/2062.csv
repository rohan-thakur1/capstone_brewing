2062,"2017-03-14",3.1,"November 29th, 2014 - Lightnings Electrostatic Ale is rather soft and gentle for something named after a crackle of dangerous energy. While light and supple at the same time, the color is decidedly deep, reflecting a deep foxy orange color, with just a little haze, and a light white head on top. The aroma is crammed with esters, mostly banana and a graham cracker sweet-bread note. Finally, the flavor is defined by its heavy alcohol, followed by a crisp and out of place sweet apple note. The body is fizzy, but not carbonated enough to break up some of the cloying sugars. On the aftertaste these sweet layers shift into grape notes, and then, oddly into an egg nog finish. Its a parade of sweet tastes, but almost all of it is too strong and too cloying.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

2062,"2012-10-29",3.7,"Enjoyed on draft at Stone Brewing in California. Poured an amber with active carbonation and a nice lacy head that clung to the glass. Smell was sweet and sour with a hint of hops. The taste was a perfect marriage between a saison and an IPA; funky flavors with a bit of wet and juicy California hops. I picked this beer primarily for the name, and also because I enjoy saisons, but I am glad I took the chance.

2062,"2012-09-18",3.0,"22oz bottle from Johncys Liquor Store in North Liberty, IA. Pours a cloudy, dull orange-gold colored body with a two finger-width, dense, frothy and foamy, off-white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is fairly sweet with some bigger, bready pils malts with some melon fruits, orange, honey, a light coriander spice, and caramel. Flavor is similar. Pretty sweet with some honey and a bigger, bready pils malt. Some yeasty spicing with a light coriander phenol, melon, and tropical fruitiness before the spicing grows a bit and this finishes fairly sweet, but not cloying with a moderate yeasty spice and light grassy bitterness. A bigger wheat malt comes in during a fairly lengthy aftertaste following a medium-full, moderately lively carbonation. Overall, this isnt bad at all, but Im just not digging the imperial saison. Not overly cloying, but pretty sweet without a lot of complexity due to the size. A decent yeasty spice and fruitiness, but not really my kind of beer. Eh...","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

2062,"2012-08-15",3.8,"Bottle from Breukelen Bier Merchants,  Honey clear color with big initial head that fades quickly.  Aroma is rich boozy honey, light sweet wheat, grass and yeast.  Flavor is a bit orange, honey, an almost broth-y richness, with a lot of peppery spice and earthy malt.  The booze is forward in the flavor but I wouldnt  have guessed it is a 10%.  There is a farmhouse funk, yeast, and liveliness to it that is apparent.  Its what it says...an imperial.  Im tempted not to like it but it is a good beer on all levels...except maybe concept. The body is lovely, velvety, soapy, with powdered chocolate milk like texture component.  I guess I like it.

2062,"2012-06-17",3.3,"Cool to see yet another Cali brewery showing up in NC! Im always a bit leery of ""imperial"" farmhouse beers, as they often tend to obscure the things I enjoy about the style in a hot mess. Lightnings rendition falls prey to that just a bit but manages to maintain some of the virtues of a regular ol saison. Slightly oily deep gold pour with a moderate carbonation, the nose is fairly sweet but theres some spicy yeast and modest hops in there that hold promise. Mouthfeel is a bit slick in places, carbonation almost trying to overcompensate for that in a sense. But the flavors are more appealing than the nose, with more balance and less booziness than Id feared. Decent and drinkable.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

The aroma is sweet and grainy with some prominent fruity esters (dried apricot, lemon zest, banana, kiwi, cherry, peach), a bit of vanilla, something that reminds me of molasses cookies (but not molasses directly), and maybe some faint clove notes. The flavor is on the malty side and is a touch sweet. many of the same fruity notes from the nose are evident in the mouth, especially the kiwi, peach, and apricot.

Theres a bit of alcohol heat to this along with a medicinal tang, but fortunately that part is rather controlled.  Theres a smidge of funk here but it really doesnt taste like a Saison to me.  The alcohol obviously makes it Imperial whatever it is.  I guess Imperial Saison, as it does have the Saison yeasty notes, but it even tastes like some Imperial Pilsners Ive had.

2062,"2009-04-25",4.2,"Everyone knows lightning is dangerous and that should you be in danger, never stand under a tree, hold anything metallic, or wave your golf club in the air. Well, the latter may only apply to Florida, but overall, lightning is mother-nature at her most beautifully potent. The Lightning Brewery is a slightly different story, which brings me to their Electrostatic Ale. A wholly unknown brewery to me up until a couple weeks ago, I ironically just read about them, and I can say without a doubt that the beer is as unique and impressionable as the folks who craft it.


My Electrostatic Ale was ablaze with hazy golden orange sparks while a slim head of off-white foam rests lazily on top while lace crackles along the sides of my glass like a shower of lightning bolts. Raising her brew dangerously close to my nose, I am struck by how spicy and full of wonderful brett tartness she is. Dry and tart with a nip of pepper-corn while her sweet side soothes with orange and nectarines. Coriander, cloves, and spice mingle with lemon in the background. Most intriguing indeed. Danger is beautiful after all, and so I waste no time diving into her tempting depths. Ooh. Spicy first, with clove, coriander, and fresh pepper dancing across my tastebuds with lingering warmth. The funk I savored in her nose is present in her body with a sour dry palate of dirty laundry, leather, and over-ripe bananas. While that may not sound particularly appetizing, trust me, it is. As I chew my way through her depths, more dry bretty funk of banana, clove, and dirty laundry pervades while spices pepper my breath. Each quaff is as enjoyable as the next, never letting go of her bright, funked nature while a very faint undercurrent of orange and nectarines refresh. Very different and very good, I could easily quaff a couple of these thirst-quenching and thirst-inducing beers.


I must say, for my first beer from the Lightning Brewery, I am very impressed. As unique as their brewers, Electrostatic Ale was an electrifying indulgence of all my senses. This is definitely one lightning storm I am glad I was a participant in.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

2062,"2009-02-20",3.6,"Bottle thanks to BMan1113VR. Pours a cloudy orange with white head. Aroma is hoppy spicy, some banana, farmhouse, fruit, alcohol. Mouthfeel is full body with low-medium carbonation. Overall, pretty good, strong beer...","Mata Gorda, Texas, USA","SphinxTX"
2062,"2009-01-30",3.2,"Appearance: Pours a hazy, amber body infused with some fine particles and topped with a thinnish, bubbly, white head.

Smell: Spicy, sweet-scented aroma of cooked caramel, dried citrus peel, and a dash of dried herbs and flowers.

Taste: Abundant caramel maltiness with a distant touch of tangy wheat. All the while theres this thriving sugary sweetness. Hint of clove. A bit of orange peel. A handful of dried herbs. Minute amount of hops and even less bitterness. Slight earthy yeastiness. Finishes a tad cloying.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. A bit syrupy.

Drinkability: Is it different? Sure. Did I enjoy it? Not so much. With a heavy, heady maltiness, a syrupy body, a dialed up alcohol component, and a severe lack of balancing hops, they seem to have completely bred all of the refreshing, quenching qualities right out of the saison.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

2062,"2008-12-31",3.3,"Bottle. Orange-amber beer with a cream colored head. Orange, malt, yeast, and spice aroma. Orange, malt, mineral, and light yeast flavor. Medium bodied. Orange, malt and light yeast lingers. A little dull. Yeast is too much in the background.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
2062,"2008-12-20",4.0,"Sampled on 12/6/2008. Thanks to the guys from Lightning for share this one. This saison pours a medium orange gold color from a 22oz bottle. Small sized white foamy head. The aroma is fruity and sweet with a touch of orange peel and spices. A medium to full bodied saison. The malts are fruity and sweet, with a touch of spices. The hops are earthy. Spicy like a saison but fruity, yeasty and sweet like a triple. Hide the alcohol extremely well. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

Full-bodied and oily with stinging carbonation. Sweet, spicy and lightly acidic. Moderate bitterness and alcohol warmth. The finish is lengthy, minerally and a touch tangy.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

2062,"2008-11-29",4.0,"Bottle.  I really liked this one.  Lots of clove, banana and spice.  Very much like a Hefeweizen. Don’t know that I would call this a Saison, but whatever it is, it’s Incredibly easy to drink.  Can’t believe this was 10%.  I could drink it all day.","Poway, California, USA","Naven"

2062,"2008-11-19",3.8,"On tap at Pizza Port Carlsbad. This beer is serious for a saison. I think the bartender gave me a full pint on accident, good for me; not for my liver. Golden color with a slight haze. Zesty citrus and banana rum aroma. Strong fruity phenolic aroma with notes of bubblegum and toasty yeast. Robustly sweet and alcoholic finish. For a farmhouse ale, this stuff will get your head right.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"
