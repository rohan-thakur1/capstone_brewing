Bright tangy pineapple nose with mineral notes knocking around. Creamy medium body with lively carb that dissipates. Pineapples and minerals on the mid palate, with a long tangy finish thats surprisingly dry.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

3813,"2017-01-15",3.0,"Bottle... Hazy neon-yellow pour with a thin veil of white foam. The aroma offers notes of lemons and a wet dog. Light-bodied with a watery mouthfeel and laid-back carbonation. The flavor is lightly citric and tangy, followed by a yeasty, lightly hoppy finish. The aroma is hitting me all wrong. Maybe its the awkward blend of Citra hops, brettanomyces and citric acidity. This doesnt taste at all like pineapple juice. Pineapple juice isnt dry or even remotely bitter  just sweet and lightly acidic.

3813,"2016-09-07",4.1,"Bottle from grownfool - thanks! Bottled 2-29-16. Hazy yellow, decent sized white head. Smells like lemon and brett, some grassy notes, and a bit of white wine. Taste is kind of like this: I cant tell if the palate elevates the taste or the flavor helps the palate, but the mouthfeel is light and airy (not fizzy, though, if that makes sense), and it plays with the bretty, mildly citric and winey flavors almost perfectly. Some mildly oak flavors round it all out. Very nice stuff.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"

3813,"2016-08-01",4.0,"My last bottle of Casey, oh well it looks like itll suit the brutal Kyoto Summer so theres no time like the present. Pouring a very attractive cloudy straw gold with a foamy eggshell-white head of foam that leaves spotty lacing behind.

The aroma is bretty funk, wheat, lemon, white pepper, mild oak and hints of pineapple though that may be because of the description I read of this beer.

Its got a soft round carbonation and a fluffy mouthfeel but finishes nice & tart while drinking light - a neat trick. This is the third blonde funky beer Ive had recently (De Ranke Hop Harvest 2015, Yamabushi Hop & Brett) and I gotta say this is one of my favorites though its also the only sour of the bunch.

It tastes great: wheat, tangy pineapple, candy sweet tarts, white pepper and it fits the heat perfectly leading me to down my first glass in record time.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"

>>> A wonderfully delicate and complex citra hopped wild Saison showcasing tropical fruits and white wine notes while also being dry and really quenching.

-  Hazy golden with a medium white head leaving some lacing. 
-  Aroma is tantalizing combining a burst of citra hops to herbal brettanomyces and Saison yeast. 
-  Tropical fruits and white wine-like notes takes the spotlight flavor wise. 
-  The lemony character team up with the wonderful dry herbal brettanomyces finish for an amazingly refreshing Saison. 
-  Body is light to medium. Carbonation is relaxed. 
-  Its a really delicate beer, but its also extremely flavorful and complex. 

Flavors:  Tropical fruits, white wine, herbal brettanomyces, lemon, Saison yeast, mild spiciness.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
