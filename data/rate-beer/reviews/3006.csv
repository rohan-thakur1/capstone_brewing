3006,"2016-04-09",3.8,"Pâte damande, bois, sueur et un soya vanillé rapidement dissipé. La texture est donne limpression dêtre juteuse, peu sucré avec un aspect aqueux dabord et crayeux ensuite. Cest assez léger mais le bouquet de saveur est considérable. Très satisfaisant.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
3006,"2016-03-28",3.2,"Bottle. Pours clear. Aroma is rice and hints of green pear. Flavor is light sweet, rice water, hints of pear and apple. Medium body, no carbonation. Perfectly drinkable.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3006,"2015-07-03",2.6,"From a sake restaurant in NYC.

Bottle?. Poured very clear like water. Some banana, rice, and bread on the nose. Some light sweetness, rice ans slight banana at the end. Palate is similar. Nothing much going on here. A bit boring for a sake.","Fair Lawn, New Jersey, USA","KoRoBeNiKi"
3006,"2015-01-13",2.3,"Cant remember where I got this, or how I ended up with it. All I remember for sure is that it was extremely cheap. That combined with me having a big zero in my sake ratings, I have officially decided to give this a go. For all I know, this is unfair, since I dont even know if I like the stuff. No idea what to expect here. Pours water clear with a sweet, boozy pear like aroma. Kinda odd. Flavor is interesting. Rice like flavor with an odd sweet mix of coconut water and pear. Sweet, with a boozy side to it. Is it horrible? I wouldnt go there, though I dont see myself ever drinking this again. File this under: Gotta try them all eventually.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
3006,"2015-01-04",2.8,"Bottle at Gachi - BWI. Pours clear, still, and translucent. Aroma is sweet rice, light vanilla and pear notes. Flavor is sweet rice, light honey notes and a dry finish. Light body.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
3006,"2014-03-09",2.4,"Aroma is fruity. Plum. Grape. A little sweet. 
Appearance is... I guess I dont know what Im looking for. Its clear.... The slightest tinge of gold. Like sllllliiiiightest. 
Taste is boozy. Light. Subtle fruit note. Watery. 
Palate is like... Weird. Its like meaty... Like meaty water. 

Firstly this is sort of an unfair rating since I dont know what Im looking for style wise. And the Wikipedia article for sake doesnt really help. The smell was insane but the taste was boozy and light. Plate was very heavy but win such little flavor it wasnt working for me.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Jamesthebrit"
3006,"2014-02-18",3.2,"180 ml bottle poured into a teku. Pours a crystal clear. No really color. The aroma is sweet and grainy. Tastes mostly sweet. Pretty light on the palate. Its a decent enough drink.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
3006,"2013-12-12",2.3,"The aroma has some mineral character. Light sweetness. Some ethanol is also present. Almost solvent-like. Transparent body with a slight slight yellow twinge. Starts fairly sweet, with a nice light sugary flavor. Light coconut flavors in the middle. Finishes with a bit of a bitter, ethanol burn, but not nearly as harsh as many of the other sakes.","","Cousin_Larry"
3006,"2013-08-07",2.8,"Small bottle purchased for $2.99 at Cost Plus World Market in Davis, CA. The aroma has some mineral character. Light sweetness. Some ethanol is also present. Almost solvent-like. Transparent body with a slight slight yellow twinge. A little viscous. Starts fairly sweet, with a nice light sugary flavor. Light coconut flavors in the middle. Finishes with a bit of a bitter, ethanol burn, but not nearly as harsh as many of the other sakes I have had. A lot more drinkable than the $35 bottle of Divine Droplets.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
3006,"2013-05-19",1.9,"180ml bottle - pours like water from a rusty hose.  nose is cork and moonshine.  flavor is watered-down moonshine with a slight alcohol bite.  This is the third sake I remember ever having, the first being in the Korean district of Boston.  this has a nutty aftertaste.  I dont like this nearly as much as the second one (Gekkeikan Josen Sake).  Little character.  Somewhat sweet.","Taylor Mill, Kentucky, USA","Chudwick"
3006,"2013-03-04",3.0,"Pours out crystal clear and still.  Aroma smells like a fresh store of some kind--thats the best descriptor I can come up with.  Light paint, freshly cleaned carpet, some linens, knick knacks lying around on mahogany display tables...or I guess it smells like toasted rice grains.  Body is really light with a quiet booziness that doesnt hit until the end.  Thankfully the flavor is nice and pleasant, unlike some other sakes I have tried before.  Light sweetness like corn flakes (without all the corn) mixed with some floral fruitiness and a little orange peel?  Trying not to use as much beer terminology but I cant help but detect the same sort of fruitiness like an IPA or something.  Much more light and effervescent, of course, but this is like the sake version of an IPA...nice faint caramel cereal tones, with some floral notes and a dash of citrus and a dash of melon.  Pity the body is too light...","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
3006,"2013-02-17",3.1,"Tallahassee, Fl - World Market - tiny little 180 ml bottle. Pours a glinty clear, no bubble action - slight oily sheen. Aroma has some coconut water accents, some rice. Flavor is smooth with some light coconut sweetness, a bit of buttered white rice, slight alcohol twinge. Nice crisp, smooth mouthfeel.  Just realized that I have not rated a sake since 2008!","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
3006,"2012-05-04",3.7,"Strong honey and coconut nose, some fusel alcohol. Clear and virtually colorless. Medium body, a little warm but not excessive by sake standards.. Distinct coconut milk flavor.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
3006,"2012-01-24",2.7,"Bottle. No head (still). Body is colorless. Aroma is light notes of grain/rice, vitamin B, mold, alcohol. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Light to medium body, watery texture, no carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic, lightly astringent. Very simple and straightforward.  Mild aroma...thankfully inoffensive. Completely unmemorable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3006,"2012-01-15",3.3,"Bottle.  Pours very clear, with just the faintest look of substance to it to make it look just a touch less like water.  Bready banana and yeast on the nose, warm rice.  Medium bodied, spicy sweetness, warm rice, a touch empty.  Gentle warmth on the finish, fairly clean.  Not a lot going on, but nice and easy drinking.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
3006,"2011-12-29",3.1,"180mL Bottle, purchased at Shaws - Boston, MA. Light sulfur and fresh tropical fruit aroma. Flavors are clean and blah, blah, blah. Guess what...any sake thats been marketed as ""fresh and light"" and comes out at $4 a pop is probably not worth the effort. This is in line with most mid- to low-grade sakes Ive had and doesnt really find a dimension at which to excel. Fortunately, it does not taste like rocket fuel.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3006,"2011-10-08",3.4,"smells of sweet coconut and has  an absolute clear look. palate is thin and oliy with a strong alcohol flavor. overall with works because of its nature very good.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
3006,"2011-10-08",3.0,"The aroma is slightly sweet and ricey but mostly watery alcohol. The appearance is clear. The taste is like the aroma but surprisingly flavorful. The palate is thin and slightly oily. Overall a light and refreshing sake.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
3006,"2010-11-17",3.2,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2010 clear with a faint beige hue. odd dry egg shell nose with faint neutral pear and rice. slight metallic egg shell and rubbing alcohol flavor. medium to light body with a lengthy peppery finish.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3006,"2010-08-11",2.6,"This bottled sake from a bottle shop poured a head of frothy large sized clear colored bubbles that were very quickly diminishing and left behind a uncarbonated transparent clear colored body and no lacing. The mild aroma was polished rice. The vinous mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a lingering vinous aftertaste. The flavor contained notes of polished rice and vinous. An OK brew just nothing special.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
3006,"2010-03-11",3.5,"Bottle @ Shige Japanese, Boise, ID: Pours clear and lighter looking. The nose is light and fruity, some light kiwi and apple notes. Pear in the tail. Not much umami but a full body and lower acidity. Drinks fairly clean with a minerally finish and more fruity notes that quaff up the back palate. Nice nama with a nice price tag.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3006,"2009-03-14",4.0,"Severely underrated and an excellent value.  Fresh and light aroma, as advertised.  Water white color.  Has a very weighty, rich mouthfeel that belies the lovely light cantaloupe and winter melon flavors.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"
3006,"2009-01-10",3.6,"This poured almost like water but maybe more like dirty water. Alot of alcohol in the nose but also a hint of citrus and rice. The flavor is very light on this one with not much alcohol burn. Some banana and citrus is detectable. It has a slightly sweet finish. Overall this was a nice sake.","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
3006,"2008-12-13",3.5,"Pours clear.  Smell is full of rice and alcohol, but pretty light.  Taste is, as the bottle says, light and refreshing.  Goes down smooth with a slight fruitiness.  Easy drinking sake.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"

3006,"2008-04-23",3.1,"Bottle says fresh and light on the front...it smells sweet and fresh....almost clear-tap H2O....cantaloupe flavors and ripe honeydew...easy to drink...I like this style--its very light...more fruit than sour essences, I would say this is my favorite of what Ive tried...300ml for $7.99 chilled","Wayne, Pennsylvania, USA","Funknmilla"
3006,"2008-03-19",2.9,"Im not sure how to rate sake, its my first one. It appears to not have much aroma to me, I believe I smell some floral notes. Taste is sweet and very smooth, and a certain flavor that I can not put my finger on, alcohol presence is there but is very well balanced. This stuff is crystal clear as well.","Mata Gorda, Texas, USA","SphinxTX"
3006,"2008-02-26",3.6,"It took me a while to figure out which sake I was drinking, as my bottle looks quite different and I dont speak Japanese. Pours a clear with a little bit of bubbles. Served chilled. Nose is faint and has notes of rice with vinegar and just a hint of fruit. Taste is very soft and refrehsing. Ultra smooth and not overly dry. I enjoyed this one and its subtle fruity notes. Alcohol content is almost undectectable.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
3006,"2008-02-08",3.3,"Served at cellar temperatures. Clear, very sweet and fruity aroma with some rice stickiness. Strong rice and fruit taste. Nice balance point between fruit and dryness. Goes down beautifully! I like it.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
3006,"2007-11-02",2.9,"Bottle from Jungle Jims. Served cold. Poured clear color with good legs. Light rice alcohol aroma. Light to medium body with a dry texture. Light sweet flavor with a light sweet alcohol finish that was short. Soft drinkable sake.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3006,"2007-09-11",3.9,"Pours completely clear ... light and airy smell, some flowers, fruit, alcohol, rice ... quite assertive yet kitten-like... wow, is actually very delicious, i would never think i would say that about a sake but they grow on you, and a quality sake like this helps in the loving process... The nicest sake i have had my a black-n-blue mile.. very good now",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
3006,"2007-04-29",2.3,"Bottle from First Korean Market. Slightly off-clear color. Aroma is kind of marshmallow like, with alcohol. Sweet candy flavors. Some soy like flavors in the finish. Im beginning to think that Im not too big on sake.","La Mesa, California, USA","mjg74"
3006,"2006-03-17",3.5,"Bottle Pours a clear, white grape juice with an aroma of subtle teriyaki and soy.  Clings nicely to the glass as it is swirled.  Flavor is fat and buttery, with raw cake dough the dominant flavor.  Hints of dull spice linger on the tongue well after the sip.  Palate is decent.  Not bad; Id drink more of this.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"
3006,"2005-08-17",3.2,"thanks again to nuffield for this one too. looks like this substance ive heard people call water. rum like aroma. not much taste to speak of. i cant even tell there is much alcohol in this. tastes like white cake icing(butter something or other if you know what flavor that is please beer mail me). cake is all that i continue to hit on while drinking this. it is pleasant enough however.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
3006,"2005-07-24",3.2,"Bottle. Nose-nutmeg, vanallia. Taste-bitter, alcohol, almonds, vanilla, lactic. Not too bad.","Carrollton, Texas, USA","Lumpy"
3006,"2005-05-24",3.2,"Im having a hard time with the sakes because Im just loving them so much, mostly because they are doing what ports used to do for me--providing a small and slow sipper while watching the evening news before heading off to bed.  Thus, the ""light"" quality here, which comes off as a bit watery, wasnt really a problem.  And it really wasnt that overwhelming in its alcohol.  It was much more a simple, hazlenut cheesecake concoction that issued a slight tingle on the palate but slipped away quickly leaving behind a trace of luxuriousness that came off as a bit of sweetness.  Not the most complex of sakes, even compared to the rather average namasake I had the other night, but that doesnt mean Im not enjoying it....","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
3006,"2005-05-19",2.7,"Ill give it a ""fresh"" - taste was clean (up front), and ""light"", well, it was a little thinner bodied than some sake, I couldnt honestly say that it was ""light"".  Had a nice sweet banana flavor to it, but the finish had a moderate amount of alcohol burn - no matter what the serving temp.  Finish was long and sweet.  Overall, I enjoyed this, but Id have to rank it towards the lower end of sake that Ive tasted so far","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
3006,"2005-02-25",2.6,"6.1 oz bottle:  Clear, looks like water(I guess it should) w/ alcohol legs on the glass.  Aroma is a little sweet & vodka like in the alcohol department.  However there is also a little bit of cooked white rice.  THeres also a little something in the aroma that I cant quite put my finger on.  Its pleasant, but I cant place it.  Sweet at first, alcohol in the flavor, but a rice flavored finish.  Sort of like my daughters Gerber rice cereal in the aftertaste.  Also vodka like in the flavor with the alcohol.  I realize its made w/ rice, not potatoes, but I know what I taste.  Clean taste, not really solventy.    Very warming m/f, heavier than water body, but only slightly, dry m/f from alcohol.  For my first Sake, Im not terribly excited about trying more.  Its not bad, but its rather boring.  Then again, I did start out drinking BMC products so they may improve the more I drink.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"
3006,"2004-11-05",3.1,"Clear...smell is alcohol sweet with something else, maybe faint marzipan...taste is fruity sweet with underlying alcohol...finish dry and alcohol...","Austin, Texas, USA","Walt"
