228,"2014-01-05",3.1,"UPDATED: MAY 11, 2017 Oolong infused Kolsch? Sounds scary. Medium bodied, grainy, the tea sort of mutes the malt and hop tones. Not really wild about this one. Filtered orange-tan body. Creamy, steady white head. Lemon tea notes. Not one Id go back for.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
228,"2013-06-10",3.7,"On tap.  Pours a clear yellow color with soapy white head.  Aroma is funk, straw, wheat and musty.  Taste is skunk, wet basement, some hops.  Very good.","South Roxana, Illinois, USA","jdskinns"
228,"2013-05-15",2.5,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2016 At Stocks and Blondes. Crisp refreshing summer beer. The tea was an interesting twist but Im not sure it totally worked for me. Maybe a tinny flavor? Serving: Tap","Chicago, Illinois, USA","rubbishystuff"
228,"2013-05-04",3.4,"On tap at Brickstone.   It poured a golden color with a white head. The aroma was of hops and grain. The taste was of dough, hops, grains with some faint vanilla overtones. Very tasty.","Wentzville, Missouri, USA","jandd1983"

228,"2013-04-26",3.5,"Sampled at Brickstone.  Clear golden with a white soapy head.  Malt, honey, and grain in the nose.  Crisp andclean.  A nice hop bite sneaks up.  A hint of spice.  A great summer beer.  The sum is bigger than its parts here.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"

228,"2013-03-15",3.4,"Draft at sheffields. Clear yellow orange pour. Sticky white head. Lemon scent to it. Tastes like a light kolsch with a lemon squirt in it.  Easy drinking and pretty good","Chicago, Illinois, USA","kaser"

228,"2013-03-11",3.5,"Brewhaha. Crisp! Pours a light, orangish yellow, with a decent head. Has a really nice sweet, cereal, maltiness to it while you drink it, but a nice crisp hoppiness to the finish, so the maltiness doesnt linger too long.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","hombrepalo"
228,"2013-03-01",3.6,"On tap at the Clybourn brewpub. Pours a clear, straw yellow colored body with an inch thick, frothy, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is soft, lightly sweetened bready pils malts with a bit of an herbal element. Faint fruits, earth, and grass. Flavor is similar. Clean, soft, lightly sweetened pils malts with a nice bread note and a balanced hopping. Light earth and grass with a slight herbal tea essence. Finishes clean an dry with a light bitterness before leaving a medium length aftertaste. Light, crisp body and a soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, a really solid Kölsch. Very clean, soft, and balanced throughout. Nice beer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
228,"2013-02-26",3.6,"Draft pour on tap at Goose Island Clybourn (Chicago, IL). Glad to finally try this. Pours a mellow hazed straw gold hue, lighter, firm carbonation, with cakey offwhite head atop. Dies to a mellow layer, laces ok. Gentle hazy body, good glow. Lively carbonation. Aromas offer gentle fruit, bready malt and straw, a gentle Oolong tea distinctly hits the nose as I settle in. Dry, a bit woody, earthy with some gentle spice. Gentle apple, fruit element creeps up. Some gentle hops. Initial is lighter body, a bit spritzy and dry off the bat, tea element distinctly dries the palate quickly. Woody, earthy, some dry grain and straw elements provide synergy. Fruit element gives a touch of melon, lemon, but quiickly gives into the tea element. Nice and dry, woody backend and finish. Oh, yeah. I like this. Backend shows more tea, earthy hops. Really sustains that dry, woody feel. Tea, gentle fruit up front gets covered up as well as the mellow sweetness. Mellow white grape, green earth interacts. Really, this is a nice beer. Fun FnW series offering. Really nice sessioner that has a good flavor, nice experience.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
228,"2013-02-18",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2013 draft at rockwells. overall impression was it was a solid kolsch beer with interesting earthy finish from the tea. clean and crisp feel. it all works in the end and a noble effort, just not sure I need the tea addition but you gotta try new things right? 3.6

Second try on tap at cly, and I enjoyed it much more. An excellent kolsch beer to begin with then subtle earthy tea character finishes very dry and woody. Clean crisp killer. 3.9","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
228,"2013-02-14",3.9,"Draft at Rockwells. thanks Kan! Pours a bight gold with a frothy white head. Nose shows breach malts, herbal tea notes. Softly aromatic with faint hops. Crisp yeast profile. On tasting, refreshing  with an herbal slant. Tannis are very low overall. Good leafy tea, light citrus, pils malt and earth. Dry finish. The tea is well integrated overall. Really neat beer and super drinkable.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
228,"2013-02-14",3.5,"On tap at rockwells. Nice surprise... Pours a mostly clear and mildly effervescent straw yellow hue and topped with a thin wispy white head... Aroma of herbal mushrooms with musty grains a little more earthy aromatic than your typical kolsch it seems... Flavors are more straight up with a semi-sweet grassy nature upfront with some mild softer grains thrown into the mix and finishes off with a light grassy bitterness. Shy of medium or just right there with adequate semi-lively carbonation.  Some if that tea is lost in the flavor as it was more apparent in the aroma. Fairly easy going to say the least.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
228,"2013-02-13",3.6,"The earthyness of the tea shines through in the aroma.  Brilliantly clear, as a kolsch style beer should be.  Nice and crisp malt taste that is quickly followed by the earthyness of the oolong tea.  A good beer overall.  Nice intro beer for craft beer beginners.","Illinois, USA","88DrawTap"
