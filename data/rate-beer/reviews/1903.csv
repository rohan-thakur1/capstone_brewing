1903,"2012-04-20",3.6,"20/04/2012 Il Grillo Brillo (330ml bottle). Dorata, abbastanza torbida, schiuma leggera, poco persistente. Naso molto interessante, pesca, frutti tropicali, note floreali. In bocca è un po più monotona, abbastanza watery, molto carbonata. Nel complesso non è niente male, una bitter ben fatta, con un bel carattere dato soprattutto dal dry hopping. Però queste genere di birre in bottiglia rendono poco.","Rome, ITALY","Mortlach"

The flavor even resembles more of an IPA, it has a good bitter kick in the end.  Front is sweet.
