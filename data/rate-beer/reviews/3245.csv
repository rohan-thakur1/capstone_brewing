3245,"2017-06-09",3.3,"Intensely sweet Tripel, bright and boozy with an everlasting head and a nose worthy of the gods. But Im not digging the taste this time around; maybe this is the freshest bottle of La Fin du Monde Ive ever drank, but it seems exceptionally harsh, the alcohol very present and the candi sugars going overboard on my palate. Starts with a even-keeled wheaty Tripel flourish, grassy and yeasty with banana-clove sweetness underlined by doughy bread, yet the sugars keep piling on, adding up, overwhelming the beer until it reaches a cloy, unpleasant finish. The ABV smacks you with every dollop of its 9% ABV, offsetting the otherwise nice sparkly Belgian texture. Needs age. I guess. Not my favorite Tripel, regardless.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"
3245,"2017-05-23",4.1,"Cork bottle: pours a light clear golden color with medium creamy head. Aroma/taste: Belgian yeast, apricots, tangerines, mild citrus and oak. Medium carbonation with smooth finish.","New York, USA","Westy1130"
3245,"2017-05-20",3.8,"750ml corked bottle opened with loud pop bought at Q-Club in SoHo, Central.
Looks: Translucent golden orange colour  with a thin layer of dirt-like yeast sediments; One and a quarter finger head with crumpety white foam which last for 3 minutes; Very good sticky lacing and fizzy slight carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and sweet full Pils malt, with very strong orange and marmalades, honey, floral, sugar, strong phenolics, strong cloves, spices, thick bread, yeast, lemon peels and grass. Very jammy!

Taste: Mid to strong sweet full malt, with strong orange and marmalades, light candied fruits, floral, sugar, light alcohol, strong spices, bread, Bel yeast, lemon, mid to strong bitter hops and fair grass.

Body: Full body. Very slick and smooth palate.

Mouth Feel: Rich maltyness in a wholesome and fairly creamy background, not too heavy and well attenuated. Strong jammy orange and marmalade throughout, matched by equally strong but pleasant sweetness. Slightly flowery with notable spicyness. Bready yeasty with lemon to round. Very nice!

Alcohol: the 9% booze is well hidden and not screaming, tasty with not much knock-on if you don guzzle it. Good!

Hoppiness: Honey, floral, spices, lemon peels and grass in nose. Floral, strong spices, lemon and fair grass in taste; Bitterness is fairly strong for an abrupt, mid to high astringent sweet-bitter malty finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Orangey sweet and fairly bitter to mouth.

Comments: This one has a different approach for a tripel - the yeast is pretty artistic for that strong orange and marmalade aroma and taste, plus strong spice, nice sweetness, fairly lean body with tasty light booze. Stand tall with top Belgian Tripels, I like this a lot!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Smells like a sweaty sock and hay - it is a Belgian style ale. Coriander, lemon zest, and black pepper flavors come out from this full and well-carbonated ale. Alcohol makes its presence known in the follow through. By the end of consumption, my feelings improved to appreciate it stylistically appropriate and pretty decent all in all.","","balloonbuffoon"

Taste: Quite discreet at first. I get some herbs and some fruit thats more dry than sweet but never obtrusive. Some citrus action in there also. Opens up more as it warms but its still a low-key affair.

Pure gold color, almost cloudy. The elegant white head dies fast. Weak legs and no visible activity.

Sweet and nicely strong floral aromas with grain and spices. Pleasant smell of malty caramel. A very sweet smell compared to the bitter taste.

Perfectly fresh yet powerful taste of bitter spices. Great taste of malty fruity citrus, almost resinous. A strange feeling of caramel that is probably maple sirup.
Its a warming and delicious feeling. A slick medium body with a drying end and a champagne like effect.

La Fin du Monde is ""Quebecs pure gold"", probably a reference to its secret ingredient = Maple sirup = Quebecs ""gold"".

Has a high, very lively carbonation, enabling the peppery and sweeter spices and a very soft, dough ending. Drinks best in small sips, as for its intense spice profile.

Dough yeast brings peppery spices immediately to the palate, balanced by wild honey and spring flowers. Rock sugar adds to the prominent spices, almost creating a short burn, evoked by the high carbonation and the higher alcohol, gently coated up by the soft yeast. Finishes with rock sugar, amping up the spices even more, bringing back a flowery note and well pronounced clove.

3245,"2015-07-05",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2015 12 oz bottle dated ""best before"" 7 Sept., 2012 (from notes). 

Pours with a white head. Plenty of sediment in the bottle, much of which remains despite a light swirl mid-pour, but some of which comes out at the end of the pour tainting (aesthetically) the center of the white head. Head has excellent duration but leaves little lacing. Liquid is a cloudy yellow-gold. 

Mainly fruity yeast and (apparent) spices in the aroma, with a touch of hops and hints of apples, bananas and pears. The taste is also quite yeasty-fruity, with hints of apples and apricots, and even some dark fruits. The high ABV is very well hidden in both the aroma (until it warms up) and the taste. Seems like there is more flavor in the finish than earlier on. Lightly tart. 

M: refined, champagne-like feel, although with more body. 

O: not my favorite style, but quite enjoyable nonetheless. I can easily see others giving this a very high rating. Flavorful and refreshing, but better as a slow sipper than as a session brew. Complex aroma and flavor.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

3245,"2015-06-13",4.2,"Bottle from December, 2013 - Pours hazy golden body with somewhat orange hue. Massive white head, great retention. Initial aroma of fresh apples, spices, particularly cloves, and banana. Scents of yeast and raisins are layered throughout. Fruity flavors of pear and apple combined with herbaceous, doughy bread taste. Solid carbonation as evidenced by the relentless upward stream of bubbles and prickly mouthfeel. Dry, slightly bitter finish; however, there is an enduring, honey-sweet aftertaste. Alcohol definitely becomes more pronounced as it warms.","Mendham, New Jersey, USA","dhatton"

 Classic tripel nose with a bit of clove and subtle sweet fruit notes.

Medium body with a bit of creaminess. Nicely carbonated with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a nice prickly rush in the finish.

The flavor profile is intense, somewhat complex and somewhat balanced. It begins with some fruit flavors that are quickly overcome by phenolic clove. Phenolic clove dominates from almost the start. The middle brings a bit of malt sweetness but never achieves balance. The somewhat dry finish has a medicinal clove characteristic that lingers. Alcohol also shows a bit of astringency as an aftertaste as it warms.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

Im getting a slight metallic taste and perhaps a lack of complexity as well as a somewhat biting carbonation which which is undoubtedly caused by the bottle fermentation. As usual, Im letting the beer warm up to bring out more flavor. Bought it an hour ago off an uncooled shelf in a store and rode it home in 55f weather in a bike bag, but as it warms up to room temps, it is more complex. Developing quite a liking for this brewery!

Aroma features very bright malts - very nice! -backed up by banana in bunches, and spicy clove, along with what seems like herbal hops (difficult to tell with the heavy banana). Flavor is a bold, yeasty weiss-style with tremendous banana, clove, and touches of bubble gum, with wheatiness tying it all together.

Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied, frothy, with a slightly wet finish and some alcohol burn.

Flavor: lots of spice (mainly cloves & cinnamon), a bit of banana, bread dough akin to a sweet roll, some mild hops for balance.

Overall: An outstanding brew that I have enjoyed many times past and will continue into the future.","Wyoming, USA","foyle"

3245,"2014-08-13",4.4,"Transfer from BA review on 11-16-12-
 Poured from 750 ml bottle into snifter

 Appearance  Pours a hazy orange-yellow color with a two finger white head. The head fades over a moderate amount of time to leave a lighter level of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma is bready and yeasty with a strong citrus orange and tropical fruit aroma. Mixed with these stronger aromas are some spice notes of a coriander and clove smell. Overall very Belgian triple like.

 Taste  The taste begins of a smooth bready flavor mixed with some tropical fruit tastes of mango, papaya and some tangerine/orange. As the taste advances, a yeasty flavor mixed with spice flavors of coriander, lemongrass, and clove come to the tongue. From there the spice and yeast grown stronger as the taste moves further forward with the sweeter fruit flavors losing some ground. In the end an alcohol flavor mixes with the rest to leave a warming bready spice flavor on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is rather complex and is really quite interesting and nice. It begins very smooth and creamy at the start with the carbonation level seeming relatively light. As the taste moves on the carbonation seems to explode from the brew within your mouth with the body crisping up. The smooth and creamy in the beginning are great for the bready and sweet that are heaviest up front, while the crisp and carbonated at the end are fantastic for accentuating the spice and booze. The feel is very nice, I must say.

 Overall  A very tasty and enjoyable to drink beer. This beer has one of the best feels of any beer I have ever had, as it seems to match and complement the flavor transitions perfectly. This is definitely one to try.","","Darkmagus82"

Fairly sweet malt nose which gives way to a yeast and fresh fruit aroma mid sniff. Maybe some cloves coming through as well.

The taste is also malt led, but not as sweet as the aroma first suggests. The yeast also has a heavy presence in the mouth and this in turn allows the other flavours to show: semi bittering hops and a spicy feel compliment the aforementioned maltiness and yeast feel to make this a truly world class beer.

Initially, theres a strong fruit combination pineapple, banana, orange, and peach with a light spice dusting and a bread dough and champagne aroma that fades. After the fading, some mango, cream, and a warm caramel are revealed. It pours a murky yellow-orange color with a soft, dense, small bubble head. A patch of micro to small bubbles floats in the middle and a thin ring retains on the outside edge. The lace is runny and leaves a clean glass. Its a medium-high sweetness with a light-medium bitter finish. The creamy texture has a light, but ample amount, of prickly carbonation. The body is medium-full and finishes with a pizza crust, spice, and jam flavor. Theres also a dull, dry white wine note in the finish. The aftertaste is mellow and sneaky - a bit of spice and buttery pizza crust with a juicy, citrus note to it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Haha, no worries. Ive had this more than enough times to say something on this.
Here goes and just about every time Ive had this into a chalice.
The appearance was a nice golden amber to somewhat orange color with a nice one finger white foamy head that dissipates within less than a minute.
The smell had a super nice allocation of iced apples, coriander, some peaches, and a nice Belgian spicy sort of yeastiness invading my nose.
The taste was sweet and spicy and said a lot about a somewhat invading pear-like flavoring over top of the apples I previously smelled. I didnt get any aftertaste but I did get a dry finish.
On the palate, it sat about a light to medium and showed a decent sessionable characteristic about it. The carbonation seemed somewhat smooth but still had a decent sharpness running about it.

The flavor continues the characteristics found in the aroma but there is an addition of a quick shot of caramel up front. A big rush of orange peel follows with some clove and banana. There is a moderate dryness towards the finish and the finish is fairly clean. Alcohol is completely hidden.

The flavor is more of the same. Belgians are definitely not my thing, but I cant get over the yeastiness and breadiness of this thing. Its definitely comparable to drinking a weird bread.

3245,"2013-09-26",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 22, 2015 Cest drole parce que la Fin Du Monde était une bière que je détestais quand jétais plus jeune. Vous savez dans le temps où on boit de la bière seulement ""pour que ça tape""... Dans ce temps là je buvais surtout de la Bleue Dry, pour vous dire! Je ne laimais pas particulièrement, mais cétait facile, ça faisait la job et jétais content! Mais une Fin Du monde? Euk! Je nallais pas boire ça toute la soirée, cétait ben trop intense! Et bien, plusieurs années plus tard, la Fin Du Monde est une de mes bières préférée. Une des bières québécoises les plus rondes en bouche, les plus profondes. Elle nest pas la plus originale, ne joue pas la carte des épices, du houblon intense ou de certains ingrédients plus rares, mais ce quelle offre elle loffre dune manière convainquante : une bière aux notes belges de levure, riche et bien ronde.

2015 : Je mets ici mes notes de dégustation dune FDM 2009 ouverte côte-à-côte avec une 2015! Voyons voir comment cette bière évolue avec le temps! Au visuel, les deux sont  très, très semblables! Le temps ne semble pas faire évoluer son aspect visuel dun iota! Au nez par contre... Ouf! La version 2015 sent beaucoup plus légère alors que la 2009 a des notes fortes et sombres qui ne sont pas nécessairement agréables selon mes goûts. Il sagit probablement de madérisation, bien que javoue ne pas être convaincu dêtre en mesure didentifier les notes propres à ce processus avec précision. En bouche, cest pas mal le même principe : il y a dans la 2009 des notes en arrière-bouche de vieille levure, de  papier mouillé et de cantaloup trop mûre. La 2015 est quand à elle pimpante de vie et rafffraichissante (autant quune bière à 9% ABV peut lêtre!). Ce fût donc une expérience intéressante, mais je ne pense pas avoir envie de faire vieillir des bouteilles de FDS volontairement...

3245,"2012-08-10",4.2,"A-- Poured a cloudy straw yellow color. Yeast had not settled when pouring. Beer is also a bit too cold about 5-6 c. Short lived bright white head that became film too quickly. Very good head retention though and able to get a 1 finger head after a few swirls of the glass. Once warmer the beer holds the head much longer and shows more carbonation. Beer shows wine like legs of an upper ABV%.

S-- Sweet bread, apricot, white grape, green apple, banana, and clove. Citrus and apple come out more as it warms up. ABV is very well hidden with the aroma. Becomes more complex and the flavors change as it warms up. ABV is well hidden with the aromas.

T-- Large dose of sweet bread followed by banana, clove, and green apple. More it warms the citrus becomes a bigger player in this. Mostly lemon but a bit of pineapple as well.

M-- Highly carbonated, lively, and creamy. Sweet bread followed by citrus tartness to it. A bit of the apple crispness in the end. No real hop presence. Mostly about malt and the yeast. A little bit of an ABV burn at the end and it does get bigger as it warms up more.","AUSTRALIA","fletchfighters"

I am having the opposite experience. My glass is coated in lace, and there is still 1/4 inch head left after 15 minutes.

S: The first whiff made my mouth water. Thats always a good sign. Belgian yeast, clove, oranges, banana, spices, citrus. Theres a lot going on here, for sure.

D: So tasty and easy to drink, I could drink this all night...and the next...and the next. The 9% alcohol, while not overwhelming, will sneak up on you in a hurry.

3245,"2012-06-01",3.6,"750ml bottle aged for a year poured into trappist glass.  Wow, Im from Quebec and I actually never rated this. Pours dark-gold, with a minimal head which reduces to almost nothing...not a tiny ring however, there is no ring at all, just tiny bubbles scattered in the middle.   Aroma is of banana, yeast, and maybe a bit bready.  This beer is not the best at hiding its abv, at 9%.  Tastes only slightly bitter, and lightly sweet.  Drank at 9C, sweetness gets a bit more pronouced as it warms up (13.5C).  Body is rather full,  texture is slick, and carbonation is very very light.  Slightly bitter, medium finish, which leaves a weird feeling, as if you still had the beer in your mouth and were feeling the carbonation.

I would think about alot of other trippels I would like to purchase before purchasing a Fin du Monde.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","BeerBeCue"

Clear golden color with large-bubble head.  Taste alternates from sweet to bitter at extremely low amplitude  and high frequency but the coupled overall flavor is  pronounced and strong.  While slight thickness is evident, tingly carbonation makes it hard to gauge.  Overall an impressive introduction to Canadian brewing.(never had a molson).

3245,"2012-05-03",4.1,"Wow, I almost have to give the aroma a lower score due to the strong vegetal component verging on rotten celery!  However, I know this is most likely due to the spices and yeast, and it gets better over time.   And thats where the complaining ends.  Slightly hazy medium yellow with a soapy white head.  The first sip tells you this is something special.   A wild blend of spices that has that vegetal edge but gets more peppery with coriander and ginger notes.  The delicious dry yet lightly honeyed malt follows this and then what seems like a slightly wild yeast component.  There are some floral and citrus notes here too and might be from the hops which are hard to pick out against everything else thats going on here.  Ends up being somewhat like a Saison flavor in the end with lasting spice and yeasty flavors.  This gets better and better as you drink it, and I dont think its due to the 9% ABV which is very well hidden (although it probably doesnt hurt).","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"

Even though this is good, I prefer their Eau Bénite (same style, but less strong in alcohol).","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"

3245,"2012-04-09",4.4,"A: Pours a yeasty, cloudy golden amber color. This one doesnt have much of a head...whats there is a .5-finger eggshell-white affair, with poor retention and good lacing (both of which improve if you let the beer warm a little). In addition, it also features faint trails of carbonation bubbles, and if you let it sit in the glass a while, some yeast sediment.

S: Banana, cloves, and bubblegum. The ale esters really take this one over. No alcohol on the nose.

T: The bubblegum flavors are the first thing that stick out to me, with the banana, cloves, and yeast blending very nicely with the wheat base. The balance between the sweetness and tartness is excellent, but the best (worst?) part is how stupidly easy it is to drink. Apart from a slight warming on the back end, I refuse to believe this is 9% ABV. Fer chrissakes, it goes down easier than some 6% beers!

M: The carbonation is high, but its only high enough to make it superbly refreshing. The sensation plays incredibly well with the buttery smoothness on the tongue. Terrifyingly easy to down.

O: Wow is all I can say. This is a beer that where you WILL need self-control so as to not down the whole bottle in 10 minutes, lest you face its alcoholic wrath. Its an amazingly refreshing and flavorful drink that will lull drinkers into a false sense of security (seriously, this is 9% ABV?) Needless to say, it lives up to the hype.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

3245,"2012-02-28",4.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/25/2010.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a tulip.

The appearance is bright like an orange sunrise, Fin du Monde is slightly cloudy from a bunch of Belgian yeast just waiting to impress me. A calm white head forms upon pouring but fades rather quickly and does not leave any lacing.

The spicy Belgian yeast pops out of the glass and into the nose. Pepper, cloves, green apple skin, soft pear, and sweet sugary bread all make themselves present.

Sweet, especially up front. The first taste is of spice and candy, with the apple, pear, and more complex flavors stepping in a bit later. The flavor is a bit tame compared to some of my favorites, so I swirl the bottle and add all of the yeast to give it more pop. The finish is a light floral hoppiness, a touch of alcohol, and more sugar sweetness.

Less that medium carbonated, slightly sticky sweet, all in a medium body.

Appearance:
Pours a hazy yellow/orange color with about an inch of head that dissipates quickly, like a cola. Carbonation is easily visible.

Smell:
yeasty and dry, but fruity. Very soft and mild smell with some amount of light fruits, like white grapes and a lot of pear. very smooth and champagne-y.

Taste:
Again, soft. A lot of pear flavor and a bit of grape in the background. A bitterness similar to fruit peel.

Mouthfeel:
Sharp carbonation and with a creamy feeling behind it.

Drinkability:
I dont think Id have more than one of these in a night, partially because of the ABV and partially because Im not really into this. Its a decent belgian, but it just doesnt quite click with me. That being said, I can recognize it as a quality beer.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

Appearance: Hazy light orange with billowing head that quickly dissolves into a thin white layer.

Aroma: Strong banana, some clove, citrus and peppery hops. Great semi-sweet fruity and spicy aroma overall.

Taste: Sweet banana and clove upfront, which then broadens to include slightly sour, almost wheat-like malts. Ends with a long lingering fruity and peppery finish. The cloves stay fairly prominent throughout.

Palate: Very effervescent, chewy body, with a dry finish. Slightly warming overall. Not a huge fan of the effervescent/chewy combination, although this improved a lot as the beer sat in the Snifter.

Overall: Very strong example of a Tripel, which I could certainly have many more times.

3245,"2011-07-07",3.6,"A - the appearance of this beer is similar to a very light champagne. Not the most impressive appearance to the beer. Poured into a snifter glass with one half finger of head. Color is golden yellow. 

S - yeast notes and faint sweetness dominate the smell of this beer. Other than that there is not much of a smell to speak of.

T - Very good. Not the best beer I have had by far, but still some pleasant notes detectable in this beer. Can definitely taste some yeast funk in here with some sweet notes. Some dried fruits are present as well, but not to a great degree. Near the end of the sip there is some definite hop bitterness that becomes present.

M - very smooth mouthfeel to this beer. Some slight carbonation notes can be detected as well.

O - Overall there is not much to set this beer apart from other beers out there. The one thing that it does have going for it is that it is very drinkable and smooth on the palate. There is some hop bite near the end of the sip that makes a little less enjoyable for me, but overall it is an above average beer.","Florida, USA","ajcobb24"

3245,"2011-02-07",4.3,"The look of this beer elicits weather analogies for some reason. I would describe it as a gloomy golden orange  cloudy, with a chance of two fingers of fluffy white head. Head recedes to clear skies after a couple minutes.

The nose is spicy  I can smell coriander and pepper. There are also distinct floral notes. There is a touch of sweetness that I would be inclined to say is honey. You can still smell the malts in the background. Quite complex

The taste is equally complex and a lot of the same players are present. Spiciness is again at the forefront of the charge but it is being backed up by a touch of clove not detected in the nose. The beer tastes a little sweet and some fruit starts to come through along with sweet understated honey. The alcohol is clearly present but subdued  well at least until the beer begins to warm. There is a dry finish.

I spent half an hour trying to pinpoint that delightful, mysterious peppery slightly sweet/slightly floral aroma from memory, then remembered my moms Biryani recipe ... which uses lots of ... CARDAMOM spice! The aroma translates to the taste too ... definitely CARDAMOMmy. Sadly, a pine-needle, junipery-aroma overpowers the delicate cardamom. 

Taste is predominantly citrus, but theres an overpowered peach too ... again, sadly. GOOD but not that drinkable really --rather a very sharp, strong, spicy beer that you have to be in the mood for. In an excellent value 750ml bottle, best for sharing. Personally I dont care for the slight meaty/gym-sock pungency and the sour aftertaste.

A - Very light, clear golden color with a huge, thick, creamy, frothy, meringue-like head. Incredibly thick head. Very good retention that finally settles into a nice creamy layer of lace.

S - Pretty typical for a BSPA with a lot of golden fruit (apple, orange, apricot). Insane amount of Belgian yeast aroma with a fair amount of candi sugar aroma as well. Slight musty aroma as well.

T - Similar to the nose with a good amount of golden fruit (see above). Also a lot of yeasty flavor as well. Pretty good amount of spice and candi sugar with the sweetness slightly outweighing the spicy flavor. Some pale malt in the background.

M - Lighter side of medium body with about average carbonation. Sticky feel.

D - Nice tasting beer with a nice body, but nothing outstanding. Still pretty easy to drink and I enjoyed drinking it, although it wasnt overly inspiring in regards of making me want another.

12 oz bottle, 40-45* in stone I.R.S. Tulip.  Pours hazy yellow-orange with a giant, foamy head.  Looks like the Duvel advertisements.  A lovely aroma consisting of orange, lemon, banana, yeast, and honeysuckle follow.  Strangely, the yeast isnt as prominent as in other tripels.  The taste is lemon-banana, with orange in the background.  The finish is floral and clean.  The carbonation stays with the brew throughout the experience.  A lovely warming effect follows.  This is worth all the hype.  This is the best tripel Ive ever had (trumping chimay, duvel, piraat, tripel karmeliet, etc).","Georgia, USA","BuckleMyShoe"
3245,"2010-04-30",3.5,"As a critic of many mediums for almost 20 years now Ive come to realize that not everything is everyones cup of tea. Certain things can be outstanding examples of whatever it is they represent, but only to specific audiences. But there are also certain items which are indeed acquired tastes but also transcend to the mainstream as at least a quality product. Unibroues La Fin Du Monde is a perfect example of this in the world of beer. Its a French-Canadian take on a Belgian Trappist tripel style  now if that description alone doesnt indicate how niche of a beer this is, I dont know what will. APPEARANCE AND AROMAThe name of this beer literally translates to The end of the world, and considering that name you might expect something dark and bloody like an amber ale, but the opposite is actually true. Perhaps they should have called this The beginning of the world since the color is a golden maize hue like the rising sun on a hot summer day. The body itself is very hazy to the point of actually being opaque despite its light, apricot-skin color. Since this beer is bottle-fermented there is noticeable carbonation due to the heavy yeast addition although the bubbles are tiny. The head is surprisingly fizzy and evaporates quickly and leaves very little lacing on the glass.The aroma is very spicy with hints of banana and clove not unlike a hefeweizen, but not quite as strong. Theres also a bread-like component and maybe a bit of dryness, as well as some alcohol. Its inviting, but the scent alone tells me this is no light brew.TASTEThe hardest part of being a beer critic is describing flavor since language and the human sense of taste are vastly different things. Some flavors are difficult to describe and Id say La Fin Du Monde is a great example of this. But to state it as plainly as possible, Id say this beer is very spicy. I do get a bit of banana and clove but they take a back seat to a mélange of spices. In fact, theres so many of them I dont think I can detect or distinguish any individual flavors (nutmeg and cinnamon perhaps). I do appreciate the fact this beer has such a complex palate because the overall taste did indeed change as I drank. It starts out rather light with a slight fruity/citrusy taste which quickly retreats as the spices take over. Theres also some vanilla to the palate which gives the beer a sweet taste. However, once the yeast makes itself known, the palate then becomes much drier and words like bready, powdery, and doughy come to mind. La Fin Du Monde is all about the malts, but even more so the yeast (it is triple-fermented with live yeast added to the bottle, after all). As I hop head Id probably prefer something more bitter, but because its so tasty I found it enjoyable. The only caveat (and this is a biggie), is that its so spicy it can be overwhelming. Not that the spices are bad, just that theyre a lot to take in all at once. This is an example of where having the proper acquired taste would make the beer seem even better, but its at least enjoyable.DRINKABILITYTrying to describe the ease of drinking this beer may sound like an oxymoron, but its not. There are two distinct factors here: the mouthfeel itself is soft and gentle and for such a potent beer does not warm as it goes down. However, it is the spices that dance on the palate and the yeast leaves a dry, powder-like aftertaste which I dont care for. I almost wanted to follow every swig with a sip of water. The spices also pack such a punch that its difficult to drink this beer in anything larger than medium sips (and for a beer geek like me who usually drinks by the gulps thats really saying something).WEIGHTIm not a fan of big beers, since the alcohol tends to outshine the palate and the potency can make a beer too filling too fast. For a beer that is quite heavy at 9% ABV, Unibroues tripel does a great job of masking it in both the flavor and the weight. Really, the only thing heavy about this beer is the palate, but otherwise its fairly light on its toes. FINAL THOUGHTSAs a budding beer connoisseur I was able to enjoy Unibroues La Fin Du Monde for what it was. As much as I understand and appreciate the craftsmanship and the distinction to a beer of this style and by a brewery with such a good reputation, I wouldnt honestly consider it among the best of the best. Its a very good beer, though. What I do like is its ability to perform that rare feat of satisfying the pedestrian drinker while also working as a connoisseurs delight.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkd1PhziXM4 (original)orhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1F36xOnehik (re-review)","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

The head bubbles up, but it settles into a calm champagne look without much lacing. The misty liquid is quite appealing, on the other hand. The nose is earthy and spicy.

3245,"2009-11-24",3.7,"Hazy yellow color with a rather big ivory-colored head that stays on for a while and leaves a nice lid of lacings.

A fine-tuned smell, complex with every piece at its place. Some gentle clove-like spices mix with pleasant fruit aromas of mostly tangerines and lemon peel. The wheat and fragile malts provide a nice clean background. Quite a lot of phenols and some alcohol. When tripels showcase smells like this, they are really great. Clean, refreshing and complex. Well balanced. (As a note, you could almost feel the gas in the nose from the carbonation in this one).

In the mouth, gentle spices (mostly cloves) and fruit esters of tangerine, pear and lemon peel lead the way to a nice semi-sharp malt and wheat character. Its a kind of sweet taste, but the spices act as a good counterweight. Bread crumbs, grass and a mild taste of earthy yeast. The wheat gets a little more pronounced towards the end, resulting in that semi-tart taste sometimes noticeable in wheaty beers. The finish holds some notes of herbal alcohol, phenols, a gentle spicy hop bite and bitterness and lingering fruity notes. In general, a complex and well balanced taste.

Moderate body, nice slick mouthfeel with a generous amount of lively carbonation.

Tripels are probably my least favorite style of the high ABV Belgian styles, but I think I can go as far as saying that this is one of the best tripels Ive ever had. Complex and balanced, yet with plenty of that Belgian edginess. This one is really easy to drink, but deserves to be sipped and savored at a gentle pace.

Pours a slightly hazy, golden orange color. One-finger head of loose white foam. Leaves a light frothy covering. Lacing is spotty and somewhat slick.

Nice banana and citrus notes come on strong. Pears, apples, oranges and peaches. Nice spiced presence, also. Corriander and hints of clove. Very inviting belgian yeast profile. Slight presence of phenols. Light barnyard funk.
This is the nose of an excellent Belgian Tripel.

Sweet fruitiness opens this one. Apples, bananas and citrus flavors. This is quickly balanced by a nice smooth spiciness. Light pepper and cloves. Nice medium malt profile. Great belgian yeast presence. 
Very nicely balanced.

As a Tripel should be, this is one smooth and creamy brew. Highly carbonated, with lots of tiny little bubbles. It feels so good in your mouth, you almost dont want to swallow it. Just let it sit there, for a while, and enjoy it.

Very tasty, smooth, and quite drinkable. It hides the 9%abv so well. I cant even tell that its there. Im betting that it will sneak up on you, though. Be careful with this one.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","coldmeat23"

3245,"2009-10-13",3.9,"750 ml bottle from LCBO, served cold in a tulip glass. Often consumed before this rating.
App.:  Cloudy deep golden with a good tight white foam.
  
Aroma:  Earthy citrus, more fruity citrus, strong yeast and bread dough, lightly perfumed, sweet honey, some banana esters, some biscuit and toast, other, non-citrus fruitiness.
  
Palate:  Medium+ body, fairly full, fine effervescence.
  
Flav.:  Quite a bit like the nose, lots of citrus notes, some nice coriander, a bit more of the malts with more biscuit and toast, still some floral honey, yeast/dough are less present; fairly sweet with a touch of alcohol and light fruitiness to finish.

3245,"2009-10-04",3.7,"Bottle.  Pours golden-orange with ample, fizzy, lasting champagne head.  Aroma is sweet and tart at once, like oranges, grapefruits, and lemons all squeezed together. It almost reminded be of a sour ale when I first popped it open.  Initial taste is sufficiently bitter, all malt and citrus notes.  Good, but a little out of balance?  I agree with the rater who posted about there being a somewhat medicinal quality.  Its definitely there, but I think its just the high ABV occasionally peeking through.  Not a bad beer.

3245,"2009-09-28",3.7,"Enjoyed from a 12oz bottle in an elongated tulip glass.  The beer pours the expected straw-colored yellowish/light golden color with a substantial and long-lasting fluffy white head.  The nose brings characters of tropical fruits and a touch of just-barely grainy pilsner malt.  The palate is relatively light on the palate, belying the beers strength.  I got strong notes of passion fruit/pearish esters, a nice level of malt complexity that alternated between pilsner grainyness and some deeper and more malty characters, and a high level of carbonation that helped to cleanse the palate.  Overall, very well crafted, and just short of the greatest examples of the style.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

So many different flavors hitting the tongue all at once its hard to distinguish them all: Sweet, malty, spicy, fruity sourness with a bit of an alcohol bite at the end.

3245,"2009-07-09",4.2,"Original review date 10/1/2008...

750 corked & caged into Ommegang chalice...

Clean, thin 1/2-1-finger yeasty even head with a clear seam topping a cloudy, honey body with quick carbonation. Looks like a good Trippel - last pour heads up a lot more but goes quickly.

Telltale Tripel signs of bountiful coriander, a little clove and ginger and nice yeast character. Hardcore electricity and wheat-ish bite. Strength dissipates with warmth.

The spicy tone of this is extremely solid and electric...clean, yeasty profile with mild malt sweetness. Solid carbonation gives this a slight saltiness that blends well to make a clean-drinking experiment in Beautiful Chemistry.

A hearty, husky malt/yeast/wheat profile gives this an extremely solid woody backbone. The spicy sweetness is balanced with the ample carbonation to provide a greay palate tingle. This exhibits quintessential Tripel mouthfeel.

This drinks at a very responsible pace. Not quickly but not too slowly. Matters, as its a pleasure to enjoy. One of the best all-around offerings that has been given a ""good look"" in some time...","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

3245,"2009-05-25",3.9,"12 oz bottle.  Big malts, yeast, and a hint of alcohol in the aroma as expected.  Pretty nice aroma overall though, with more specifically pale grain malts, yeasty butter crackers, a slightly mix of grain and vinous alcohol, some herbal hop qualities and some other light spices.  Pour was nice, though not over-the-top like others of the style can be, with a wispy milk white head, good retention and lacing, cloudy body and orange gold in color.  No real surprises in the drinking of this beer either, but this isnt necessarily  a bad thing when beers actually live up to your exact expectations.  But anyway, medium body, a good tripel bite to it, and very good balance.  Flavor is a good combination of Belgian blonde pale malts, a nice herbal grass bitterness that spreads and balances the whole way through, minor citrus orange, yeasty crackers and popcorn, and some various savory spices.

RE-RATE 1/23/11 Bottle from Central Market.  Been meaning to get around to re-rating this.  That stupid IPA comment has bugged me forever. 

This beer appears quite cloudy, with a golden color shining through.  The head response is very quick right from the moment of agitation.  I tried to keep most of the cultured yeast out of it but I think that is leading to the cloudiness.

The aroma is very fruity, with a spicy clove like nose and banana.  It is pretty spicy most definitely.  It is quite appealing, with a grainy backbone.

The flavor is spicy as well, with like a earthy ginger flavor.  Fruit also comes through on the palate, and remains till the finish.  There is a bit of alcohol tingle towards the back of the throat with a lingering dryness.  There is also a sweetness that has a soft, floral touch to it.

The alcohol on this is 9%, and it can definitely be felt in a warming fashion.","Arlington, Texas, USA","Cavie"

Cools and burns at the same time... an almost unbelieveable combination of refreshment and taste, readily causing amnesia at the thought this was ever a tripel at 9%....beautiful.","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"
3245,"2008-11-27",3.8,"There are multiple cliché images, songs, and phrases that run through my mind whenever I think of or see the La Fin du Monde from Unibroue. Literally it translates to The End of the World. Quite fitting I must say for a strong Belgian tripel worthy of the best of her native homeland, Belgium, even though she is from Quebec, Canada. Besides being fun to say and chuckle about, La Fin du Monde is also an excellent beer to drink. After all, if the world were truly ending, I know I would want a damn good beer in my hand, for which she perfectly fit the bill.She came to me in a bottle before emptying herself into my glass with a huge head of foam which rested most decadently on top of her hazy orange body. Bubbles stream from bottom to top, releasing an aromatic assault of spicy yeast notes, pungent wet sourdough, melon, apples, cinnamon, and leather. Some might say yuck, but I say yum. Her body and mouthfeel is as delicious as her nose, sweet and viscous with a mild chewiness. Weaving a subtle layer of spice and yeast, apples, melons, and pears also make their presence known in this varied and well-balanced palate. A lingering citric bite in the finish cleanses and brings me back for more. The further I go the more her warm embrace slowly pervades through my body, leaving a faint breath of spice. Rich, chewy yet smooth, yeasty with orange, melon, and pear essence, apples and spice, and a citric lemon nip hold this amazing Belgian-style tripel together. Hopefully the world never will end, though if there were to never be any more La Find du Monde that would surely be an end to my world as i know it.Unibroue never fails to always satisfy me, and more often than not, she blows my tastebuds away. La Fin du Monde falls squarely in tbe middle of said equation. While definitely more vibrant and faithful than some Belgian tripels I have quaffed, she doesnt quite equal her predecessors either. I wonder how she would age, so I must remember to set aside a bottle the next time I bring her home.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

3245,"2008-11-21",4.7,"The pour is a hazy golden color with a nice fluffy white head.

The smell is very floral with hints of fruits, mostly citrus. Also a bit of buttered biscuits as well.

The taste is initially a mix of tropical fruit with slight floral hints coming through. There is also the presence of cloves and other spices I can’t put a finger on. The finish is a blend of yeast that is warmed very slightly by the alcohol.

The mouthfeel is light and pleasantly light and fizzy.

This is an amazing brew overall. Very complex smells and flavors are found with every sip. Even towards the end of the glass I struggle to connect what I am tasting to other tastes and smells so I’m just going to give up and simply say that this is an excellent example of a tripel that I would gladly have any time.

I also get the TJ versions too... starts with a sizable head that settles to a 3/4 finger head/lacing with fine champagne like effers, very nice aromas of candied dried apricots, citrus zest, baking spices and some bready yeast, almost white ale like but with heavier malting and fruitiness... this may not be the traditional triple but go for it anyways, it wont dissappoint... flavors are a complex balanced creamy blend of apricots, peaches, citrusy zest some ginger and nutmeg like spices... the fruits expell themselves on the light creamy finish...

Very complex and smooth aroma, with an alcoholic warmth to finish.

Taste is fantastic.  Very complex fruity flavor up front with clove and spice on the back end and I cant taste the alcohol, which is quite impressive for its 9% abv.

Palate is also fantastic, it is very thick, rich, and dare say creamy.  It goes down exceptionally smoothly and leaves your mouth watering for the next sip.

The aroma is full and fruity. There is sweet orange citrus and spicy character with a big hit of yeast and tropical fruits like pineapple. It has a sweet rich and fruity malt and yeast flavor up front. Tropical fruit like pineapple and guava are noted. Soft spices come out and the alcohol starts to warm things up. Hops add a light citrus and leafy flavor before the yeast comes back out and turns powdery and slightly dry in the slow lingering finish.

The initial attack is of yeast, over ripe apricot, some wood and light fruit.  Though I tasted some mild soapiness, perhaps a breakdown of fatty acid.  Perhaps it was the glass (I was not at home).  Still a lot of fermentation leads to some excellent CO2.

Fruity dry finish, light hop.  This beer has a decent mouthfeel and subtle alcohol taste for its content.

Flavor is much stronger than the aroma, with continued citrus, some banana, bread and floral notes and some spice in the finish.  I have to disagree a bit with the poster below me--I think the flavor actually hides the 9% ABV very well.  It is medium to full bodied with a smooth creamy mouthfeel.  A very nice beer and a surprisingly good representative of the style.","Bethany, Oklahoma, USA","WesKBob"

Has a classic belgian tripel aroma, fruits (apple, apricots and banana) and spice, but not too heavy.

The flavour is something of a letdown, it is absolutely dominated by the alcohol and the other flavours are a little too light to really stand up to it.

It is a pleasant beer to sip, but I prefer a subtler, less alcoholic tripel like the underrated Grimbergen Blonde.

Smell that hits you is a sweet, fruity one, which might be effectively reproduced by mixing lemon peel, coriander, orange, grass and cotton candy.  This beer is strongly carbonated, has a fairly light body (for an Abbey Tripel), and contains minimal traces of 9% alcohol.  Strong rum fruit-cake flavor, along with banana and clove.  I found the flavor to build as this beer warmed, and that trademark unibroue fruitcakiness stayed in my mouth well after the gulp.

So this just kind of fell in my lap.  I was reasonably impressed by the bright gold body, large marshmallowy head, and decoration of Belgian lace on the glass.  I think of this color as ""kings gold""... and a Duvel instantly comes to mind. There is an immediate scent of Belgian candi sugar, dessert apples in cinammon; very sweet, swimming with caramel. The taste, as expected, was strong, sweet, and only slightly bitter with fresh, bright, citrus notes, lingering candy, and tropical fruits ( a hint of mango perhaps.) Overall a lusciously soft palate and medium/ long finish.  I cant say this exceeded my expectations, but thats only because I already had set them so high.  The same goes for all of Unibroues beer.  I expect nothing but the best from them, and Ive never recieved anything less than that.","Independence, Kentucky, USA","shalloWMeans"

3245,"2008-03-06",3.3,"This is pretty good, but I was expecting a lot more from the makers of the wonderful Maudite.  It is faintly hazy light gold with a big, dense, long-lasting off-white head that leaves only a weak hint of lace.  The aroma is pears, a witbier-like grain and banana quality, a hitn of spie, and a meaty, winey alcohol quality.  The taste is rather smooth, warming alcoholic sweetness with a light bitterness, mostly subtle pears, winey grape, light grain and a soft witbier-hefeweizen character.  It is light, crisp while at the same time being vaguely warming, soft, and almost oily.  But, the tastes are rather subdued and it really lacks the richness or the complexity and pungent quality of something like Westmales tripel.

3245,"2008-02-29",3.9,"33cl. bottle, bottled Nov22, 2005: Slightly hazy (due to bad pouring on my part) amber with jut a slight tendency towards red. Nice thick dense (barely) off-white head. Cooked apple and raisin sauce aromas. Hops still kicking in after all that time in the bottle!... not strong but a good earthy, fruity hop note. Grilled banana with vanilla ice-cream in the background with just a slight drizzle of caramel and cardamom. There is a definite, strong, toasted grain component to the aroma that makes it feel almost gritty in the nose. A fruity yeast dusted over the top as a garnish with a light squeeze of lemon. Nice tight had lasts for a long time. Flavor... For some reason one thing comes to mind, hopped honey with a drinking problem. Ok, maybe thats not exactly right but that came to mind first. Start with a biscuit base, dip it in pear juice, drench it with honey, sprinkle some ground up earthy (almost cheesy) hops on top, roll it in some grain an serve it in bit sized chunks. I am sorry I waited so long to open this bottle, but at the same time I think the age helped develop some of these wonderful flavors. This is a style I have been somewhat bored with lately (there are a lot of uninspired tripels out there) but this is quite nice. Maybe I should get a fresh bottle to compare... but then again I may not like it. It seems to have aged really nicely. I guess the only real complaint I can give is that it could be a touch drier.","Brasschaat, BELGIUM","CapedBrewsader"

I find it is missing some of the dryness and white pepper notes I enjoy in this style, and think I used to enjoy in this brand. The finish is a little cloying, and the body is a little to full for a tripel. A Belgian brewer will say it is to filling, and I would agree.

3245,"2008-01-12",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 28, 2016 Bottle.  Sweet yeasty aroma with strong candy sugar and spice (corianderish).  Golden body with medium-strong carbonation and a large, rocky, excitable white head.  Taste is sweet and malty, dries out significantly and finishes dry and yeasty, a touch of cobweb in there but otherwise riddled by fruitiness and pervasive white pepper.  Nice floral hoppiness, really a part of the whole.  Medium body but stylish and slashing, just crisp enough to be interesting, with lots and lots of bubbles.  Well-hidden alcohol with just a subtle, slow-coming warmth.  A classy classic! [2008.01.12: 4.0]Bottled, foiled screw-top BB 01-06-19, so nice and fresh.  Nose lovely vanilla and golden, grainy-pilsy malt, some faint pseudo-oak and stronger Hefe-like yeast components.  Pour bright golden with a very large and soapy-dense cream head, bubbles and recedes and allows he aroma to fill the room -- more mineral character, lemon meringue and cream.  Taste medium-sweet (much sweeter than I prefer my tripels) with low-to-no bitterness save for the dash of minerals at the end, yeasty-creamy throughout with light alcohol and adult passive-aggressiveness (generally well-hidden, though).  Medium and very smooth body, all of the above flavors with background flits of green apple and raspberry, honey, clove, medium-strong banana and fainter spice.  As this one is much fresher than the last few, the Hefeweizen comparison seems much more apt -- sparkling and fruity with successive layers of esters and phenols, relaxing on a bed of soft malt and bright lemony-orange pillows.  Doesnt have the hops I remembered (theres a dash of purple floral here, a dash of herbal there, but all are constrained), but the added freshness and vibrancy are tremendous!  Not like others, but were better off for the difference.  [2016.11.28: 4.5]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

3245,"2007-12-21",3.5,"From a 12oz Bottle.  Twist off cap.  Pours a hazy, ripened banana skin yellow color with a finger of fizzy white head.  The head falls apart rather quickly, but a steady stream of bubbles keeps churning up the center of the wispy film, encouraged by the D in my Duvel glass, letting me know its still alive.  A vigorous swirl churns up a renewed serving of frothy white, but it recedes back to the prior state in a relatively short-lived time.  An earthy Belgian yeast presence makes its self known instantly, bringing out notes of shittake mushrooms, bright pepper, and a smidgen of bandaid.  A distinct, citrusy, candied orange aroma also appears, along with some herbal coriander.  As it warms, the fruit notes become more forward, as does the coriander.  Im getting a nice little squeeze of lime and gentle cardomom.  Light bodied, well carbonated mouthfeel that melts across the tongue with a soft, creamy wheatiness.  Silky palate with a touch of wheat acidity.  Some of that spicy yeast character jumps out right away, tickling the palate, and the subtle bandaid quality from the nose is still there, but only noticeable when looking for it - the pepper characters tend to dominate.  Not nearly as fruity or sweet as in the nose.  The coriander notes get a bit too strong for me in the finish, and although it results in an expceptionally dry conclusion, I find it gets a bit too herbal.  Pretty enjoyable overall, but I have a hard time getting into the yeast characters of Unibroue beers in general (this one being no exception) and the coriander flavor is too much for me.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

The foam rapidly recedes to a uniform, cloudlike mat, and only sparse lace remains. Spicy and earthy aromas dominate, teeming with floral Szechuan peppercorns and clove. A less aggressive, soft fruitiness rounds out the bouquet, with bubblegum, orange pith, plantain, and grape the effect is downright perfumey; a mesmerizing musk. Passing the lips, the liquid starts crisp and sharp, then mellows into a laughing melange of tropical fruit flavors: mango, watermelon rind, cherry, and unripe pear. Lively clove and rumcake spiciness adds interest, and a relaxing vanilla note lazily reins it back.. The clipped finish features a flash of tartness and tight bitterness, with a retronasal suggestion of bawdy barnyard funk. Healthy, fluffy carbonation accentuates the bone dry, pins-and-needles mouthfeel. Finally, a lingering, gingery alcoholic glow partners with the tingly, tongue-numbing sensation of ice crystals. A study in contrast, balance, and outright fun... as seamless, smooth, and surprising as live jazz.

3245,"2007-10-13",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2007 I am lucky enough to consider this one of my table beers. I just love La Fin du Monde and consider it the flagship beer of the Unibroue brewery. It rivals many Belgian beers of similar style. Its got a sublime mouthfeel. The yeast is that distinct one that can seem sweet to some. At times when I drink it the beer seems too sticky-sweet but other times not, so it might depend on factors like food, etc. Its complex and fun to drink, although can sit heavy in the belly. That doesnt detract from points though, because that is just the nature of a beer like this. There is a lot of banana and all those tropical-like smells and flavors. But what more needs to be said about this much-loved beer? It deserves accolades and must be one of the best of its type brewed in the New World.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"

Its got exactly the color and head that one could only dream for in an abbey tripel and a very pleasant fruit filled aroma.  I understand that unibroue uses old belgian techiques and belgian yeast strains to boot, but is it too much to ask that their beers have individual taste profiles.

3245,"2007-09-10",4.5,"This is a side by side review of a 750 ml bottle and ratings a 12 ounce bottle to compare differences between the two. 

Interesting start already. The 12 ounce bottle almost began to foam over the top of the bottle. The 750 ml smoked quite a bit instead. 

Holy head. Maybe this 12 ounce is over carbonated. But the head poured massive, even though I did my best to pour gently. Head is very white with small bubbles compared to the 750 which poured just a little head with much larger bubbles. Color is a cloudy gold, but the 750 bottle seems to be just a touch darker. 

Nose on the 12 ounce seems a bit more pronounced with a higher tone towards sweet, though there is a strong yeast presence as well. The 750 ml seems more muted, though I think matured might be a better term for it. I think I actually just got a whiff of strawberry?? Yeah. I think so. Strawberry and strawberry stems, and wet ones at that. I can see the same base for that smell on the 12 ounce, but it just hasnt ""developed"" to that point yet I think. 

Taste. The real test. The 12 ounce is smooth and yeasty with a touch of sweetness. Damn that is good. The 750 is muted. I am wondering if this is a bad bottle. Between the two, the 12 ounce seems to have a stronger flavor. The first thing that comes to mind is a 16 year old driving his first car (12 ounce bottle) and a 30 year old driving the love of his life to the place he is going to propose to her (750 ml bottle). Yeah. The 12 ounce is the hyper active kid, and the 750 is the more mature of the two. 

Mouthfeel on the 12 ounce is thick with carbonation and the 750 seems to be just a touch thinner. 

Drinkability. I think they are both on the same level. 

Overall this was an interesting expirement. I do however have to wonder if my 12 ounce bottle was overcarbonated and if that would effect this kind of ""test"". As the 750 bottle warmed, I have to say the flavors became more pronounced and overshadowed the 12 ounce bottle. Bottom line though - still a damn good beer.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","RblWthACoz"

3245,"2007-08-07",4.0,"Rating 1800!! Bottle (750ml). I chose this Canadian classic for my 1800th rating because, well for one thing its a great beer, and also because I recently realized that Id never rated it -- I was quite surprised as Ive had it so many times that I just assumed I had rated it! Time to correct that with this milestone: Pours a lovely hazy yellow-gold with a large lasting foamy white head. Yeasty aroma with pepper and other spices along with some citrus and sweetness -- very nice. Sweet and spicy flavour of yeast, citrus, pepper, caramel malt, spices and much more -- complex and very flavourful. Some alcohol in the spicy, lightly bitter finish but for 9% it hides the alcohol very well. Medium to full bodied, nice carbonation. Even though I initially forgot to rate this beer, I never fully forget it, and when I see some in the dépanneur in Quebec I always buy some as I believe its one of the finest Tripels in the world -- a truly fantastic beer.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"

Clear straw yellow, effervescent, frothy crackling head. Distinctive tripel aroma, banana, clove, general fruity esters. Light spritzy texture, alcoholic zing, slightly bitter finish. I havent had a beer like this in a while, or any tripel for that matter. A little nostalgic for me. Tasty but seems somewhat simple now. The main thing holding this back is the alcohol content, the carbonation, and the bitterness, not to say it isnt meant to be like this.

3245,"2007-05-17",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 22, 2008 341ml Bottle. Pours a really nice hazy-orange colour, with a massive head that refuses to leave (and provides a strong think lacing on the glass)........waiting waiting waiting........slightly sweet aroma of various fruits and yeast, surprisingly little hint of alcohol considering the content. The flavour hits pretty hard, not as much yeast as the aroma made it seem, definite burn that lets you know it is in fact 9% alcohol, the various fruit flavours make it pretty complex and difficult to pick apart, but theres still some good malty sweetness evident. Finishes strong, very strong actually, with a similar burn to that of brandy or cognac. Pretty enjoyable up until the harsh alcohol burn, but I guess some people like that. Actually as it warms it gets sweeter which is definitely a plus. Im putting away the rest of my 6-pack to let the bottles age, just to see what will happen. After ONE year: Already a big difference! Much more complex fruitiness, some more delicious elements such as peach. Darker in colour too, I poured it at first without the yeast, so it looked like Duvel, then the sediment came, looking browner than I remember, but the yeasty flavour is increased, and tasty. It seems to be coming along well.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

3245,"2007-05-17",3.8,"Bottle, courtesy Sunskates. Thanks bro. Hazy yellow gold with a coarse layer of white that head that refuses to go away. Heavily over-ripe fruit aroma--the dumpster behind a fruit stand on a hot day. Warm, vulgar, but kind of appealing at the same time. Deeper in there is tart pie apple, cinnamon, rough cognac. For all the riot to the nose, the flavor is fairly delicate. Clove, cinnamon, apple, peach, given some bite by the bright carbonation. Light body for the abv, with just a bit of heat around the edges. This is a beer that wants to be loved or hated. I want to love it, but Im not sure I feel good being around such sketchy characters. This beer would steal a £20 off your table when you werent looking.","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"

Orange color, small off-white head. Fruity yeasty aroma - there is at least mango, banana and orange, quite typical American-Belgium style nose. Very crisp carbonated mouthfeel. Orange zesty, fruity, only a bit yeasty flavor. Sweetish tripel which hides its ABV very well. Light alcohol in the aftertaste, almost watery too as fruityness fades away, but good one anyway.","Pori, FINLAND","TBone"

After much research, 750ml bottle seems to taste better than the 12oz.  Best slightly chilled or cold.  My only complaint (and its a small one) is that the carbonation seems a bit excessive - quickly remedied or course by pouring out a slightly larger head after opening.  Good stuff!","Deerfield, Illinois, USA","kingofdiamonds"

Both malt and hops take a back seat in this style, which is preferred.  This beer is like a belgian white on steroids.  Pleasant overall.  Bubbly light palate but not watery.

The aroma was fantastic and complex with nearly something different with each new smell. It poured a murky dark yellow with a huge off-white frothy head that stayed. Lacing was good.

Very similar to the Don in aroma and taste. Amazing nose of sweet, ripened fruit nectar - cantaloupe, pineapple, mango and peach. Reminds me of Jumex - a thick, lush Mexican juice made with exotic fruits. The light rum-like alcohol edge gives it the character of a mixed drink. Full aroma, without being heavy or overly sweet. It makes for a nice alternative to the standard Belgian nose. Taste to match, but with the addition of honey and stronger hints of alcohol. Long finish of pineaple, passion fruit and warming alcohol.

It is slick and medium-bodied and fizzy like champagne.  There is the warmth of alcohol at the end of the flavor.  As just about all the Unibroue offerings, the flavor has a great balance between sweet, sour and bitter.  The flavor starts like the aroma and gets spicy like cardamom or something.  It then develops a musty noble grape character.  It has a medium-length aftertaste of alcohol.  This is quite unique.  It certainly has wine-like qualities.","Fairport, New York, USA","yesyouam"

Very lively in the palate (perhaps a bit overcarbonated). Easy to drink, especially for a beer with such a high alcohol content. This is a nice and high quality beer, but it is by no means mind blowing.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

It pours a straw-color with excellent tightly packed head (think Duvel).  The beer is hazy, and smells lightly yeasty, like you would expect a tripel to smell.

Taste is also of yeastiness, although the flavor is not tremendously complicated like other tripels Ive had.  There is not a lot of spiciness.  However, the taste is simple, pleasant, and the mouthfeel is very evervescent and refreshing.  I really like this beer!","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

3245,"2007-01-28",4.0,"This was a very pressurized bottle with plenty of carbonation in the drink. Pours absolutely beautifully, leaving a thick white head with a strong orange-coloured body. The aroma is the typical Unibroue smell with spices and ripe fruits like plums and grapes. The first sip had great flavour of spices and a plenty of other notes. I did not fully appreciate the drink until I took a rather large drink of it and noticed that it was amazingly smooth and malty; this MADE the beer. 

Overall, it is a very well made beer, reading the other reviews for this I have no clue why people can not tolerate the alcohol taste and in some instances they call it ""cheek and throat burning"". Perhaps these people are very sensitive to alcohol, but I did not find this a problem at all, I would have never guessed this beer was 9% ABV in the first place, more like 6-7.5%. Infact, Id go as far as to say its drinkable enough for almost any occasion despite of the ""gourmet"" label that Unibroue give this. Its beers like these that make want to never buy mainstream or cheaper brews ever again.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Jordiam"

Its got a nice flavor, a complex mix of some spices and a citrus note.  I didnt find it too sweet, but I only sampled one 12 oz bottle quite slowly. I can imagine how more than one glass could be a bit overwhelming. I think the yeasty flavor does take the edge of the alcohol which could otherwise be quite strong and perhaps overpowering.  Its a pretty good beer and, given how relatively easy it is to find in the States vis-a-vis many other craft beers, its definitely woth a try.","New York, New York, USA","nramsburg"

Taste; very fruity with oranges and lemons, and theres some other fruits that I cant quite place. The spices and sweetness are almost to overwhelming for me.

Body is a beautiful thick murky golden.  Amazing almost no clarity for a golden beer.  Aroma for me is world class.  Strong honey and almost tea like sweetness beautifuly melded with candi sugar.  Some effervescent lemony, citrusy sweetness as well.  Very original yet true to the belgian feel.  Some earthy undertones.  Taste is similarly sweet with a strong belgian feel.  A very good translation from aroma to flavor with a little bit more of the citrus/tropical fruit aspect.  Just a small hint of bitterness in the end.  Present carbonation on the cheeks but not overwhelming.  Medium heavy body.  I feel this beer has been underappreciated b/c of its availabilty.

Mouthfeel is first dominated by the carbonation, agressive and tingly with the evident, but not unpleasant alcohol.  Medium-bodied and dry, with neither hop nor malt character dominating.

The fermentation just poured out when I opened the bottle, similar to a champagne bottle. Hue was orange like and cloudiness was very hazy with particles being medium and density being average. Because of the triple fermentation, the head was huge and extremely frothy. Head longevity was mostly lasting with some excellent lacing. The sniff was quit impressive, maybe caused by the triple fermentation again. God blend of moderated hoppy and yeasty notes. Some of them being flowers, perfume, grass, lemon, orange, cheese and leather. Other notes were spicy, apple, coriander. Palate was slightly misleading, as it hides the alcohol so well. Tempted to say medium bodied but mend as a positive ting. Texture was silky smooth with a fizzy carbonation. Initial flavor was light sweet with some acidity and bitterness blending nicely in there.

Lively carbonation dances on the tongue, giving lift to flavors of peach jam and overripe banana.  Subtle acid twang on the back end also helps keep the brew from being too heavy.  Actuallly, the body seems quite light for the ABV.  Finish is long, complex, and mouthwatering.

3245,"2006-11-08",3.4,"11/8/06.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, purchased at Liquorama in Upland, CA 7/25/06.  Rated blind.  Pours a cloudy golden-tan color with a generous, densely beady white head.  Lacing is good while it lasts-- uniform and falling in slow sheets-- but the head doesnt retain particularly well.  Aroma is bright, sweet, and yeasty with all kinds of fruity esters and a spiced character-- candied orange peel and coriander-- with a boldness that climbs out of the glass.  A little bit of alcohol beneath it, and perhaps too sweet.  But still quite lovely.  Flavor carries the fruity sweetness and coriander/alcohol bite a bit too far, losing much of the softness and subtlety that were so warming in the aroma.  Candied orange-pineapple and some slight doughiness with the coriander laying like a soggy blanket on top of everything.  Pretty incredible array of fruity and spicy yeast characteristics/fermentation byproducts on display here, but the elegance is somehow lost on me.  Fluffy and creamy mouthfeel, very airy with effervescence to lift up the medium body and carry the yeast flavors to all parts of the mouth.  The finish is a lengthy mess of alcohol flavors, glowing in my throat like Im wasted even though Ive only had a few sips and its my first beer of the night.  Really a big detraction from the otherwise fine mouthfeel.  Slightly numbing from the alcohol prominence.  A solid but unspectacular offering, one that I cant drink but maybe a glass of at any one sitting (and on rare occasions).  And I guess its worth saying that I guessed what it was after the first couple of sips.  That Unibroue house character and booziness is unmistakable, and I wouldnt say this is one of their best beers.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

Tastes of sweetened ripe harvest fruit, nutmeg and golden toasted bread.   Not much of an aftertaste but a remnant of nutmeg flavor remains as it warms up.

It poured a light amber with a massive head which dissipated quickly, but left lots of lace. Flavour pleasant, but not terribly impressive - weakish, a lot of citrus and not a lot of other fruit. A very present taste of alchohol - the 9% ABV hit me like a brick wall about 10 minutes into sipping down about half the bottle. A lingering honey aftertaste - odd! The mouthfeel was unremarkable - good carbonation, at times a bit excessive.

Plenty of spice throughout the palate, even a tinge of pepper at the edges. Clean herbal hop finish, no linger. Great stuff, and one of the first worldly brews a friend ever gave me--10 years ago now. Shes lost her husband this year, and its sad to drink this beer and think about when he was still around, now that hes gone. Great beer given in good spirits is always a happy memory, though.

Its all present in the flavour, intense and busy with an incredible earthen tone alongside the hops that hit the back fo your tongue.

Deeply yeasty nose, somewhat sour and rank, some lemon, some banana. The flavor follows, dominated by bready yeasts and an incessant sour chalkiness that seems untrue to style. The bitterness is pretty laid back on the long end, and so the beer ends up missing some of the snap you get from e.g. Westmalle.

The powerful alcohol percentage is well-hidden in the complex array of tastes that seem to start on one side of the tongue and finish on the other.

When I first opened it, I thought the bottle had been cellared in a centrifuge.  It fizzed for at least five minutes before finally settling down enough for me to be able to pour into my snifter.  It looks like a heavy carbonated apple juice, although the smell was much different.  I picked up hints of citrus, grapefruit, pineapple and some earthiness.  After letting it settle down, the first sip gave a nice impression of apples, pears, hay and other barnyard flavors.  It may have been a little sweet at first but soon mellowed out with a nice full presence in the mouth.  The aftertaste yielded the more spicy aspects of this - there was coriandar and pepper mixed in a honeysuckle-like finish.  Overall, it was a great drink although I think I would have to be in the right mood to drink it again if only because of the gushing foamy head.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

A spicy acidity balances a light, fruity, citrusy, sweet, dough-like malt in the flavor profile.  My only knock on this beer is that the carbonation level is always too high.

Taste is the spicey tripel with its unique, smooth malt taste, and to me, a little more toastiness in the malts.  Alcohol shows a bit, adding a little tingle to the mouthfeel.  Fruitiness and spice are in there too, no hops that jump out to me as hops, though Im sure theyre there, helping those wacky ester flavours coming out in the right manner.  Not especially yeasty and pungent to me, like some tripels are, but there definitely is a bit of that character.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","sandwichpants"

Flavor adds vinous notes (Chardonnay) to the menagerie from the aroma, but an emerging alcohol presence appears and is a bit bright on the back half of the drink.

Consumed: October 2008
Better consumed early me thinks. Ive had this drop a few times within 12 months of bottling and it is clear this a very smart beer. However, medium term cellaring hasnt really helped here. The sweet chunky malts and yeasty character has largely disappeared in the mouth although still shows in the aromas (albeit in a modest way). Still too much fizz here and I dont think this helps the flavour. Structure is fine but the flavours aint.
Vintage: 2005
Consumed: Jan 2006
Vibrant orange with an attractive haze with a thin fizzy head settling after 5 minutes.  Big nose of spice and malt sweetness. Powerful palate, more heavy malts but loses some of the spice evident on the bouquet.  Some alcohol heat apparent but within the styles context. Good structure and excellent mouthfeel in the back palate with broad spices and cinnamon. Finishes with a surprising degree of elegance given the powerful character evident early.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"

There is a light malt nose with some hops and heavy floral and citrus notes.  Palate entry is fairly sweet, but there is a residual sweetness reminiscent of honeysuckle nectar due, perhaps, to bottle fermentation.  Grapefruit citrus flavors predominate in the mid-palate, but I also detected essences of coriander and clove spice.  The short, clean finish is refreshing and moderate on hop bitterness.

The body is full of carbonation, that expands the complex body across the tongue.  The soft yeastiness infuses more sweet fruit into the layers of fresh, bready malt.  The high ABV is hidden well throughout, making this monster extremely drinkable.  The long, dry finish may be the bottle conditioning yeasts at work, and may become overly dry eventually.

The flavour is of coriander and lemon with light sweetness and moderate bitterness.  The large amount of yeast makes the flavour even more complex.

3245,"2005-10-20",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 12, 2007 I always make sure to have a notepad with me during beer tasting sessions.  My schedule is such that I dont always have time to write a review immediately after tasting a beer, so its a good system so far as it works.  However, I seem to have recently lost my notepad and for this review I must rely on memory.  The Fin du Monde poured an orange opaque color, and I couldnt help but think it looked like an obscure digestive fluid.  The foam was not as off-putting as the color, but was un-engaging.  The taste was far more appealing, bearing itself like a citrus and floral hand soap, but in a decidedly good way.  I think of fancy restaurants that cant afford to have patrons off-put by any of the aromas associated with a bathroom, cheap cleaning agents being one of them.  I also sensed a lot of yeast, rich and pleasant, and mostly associated with a loaf of sourdough bread.  What I missed, though, was a sweeter element that didnt belong to a citrus fruit.  If the sweet bits rely solely on that, the tripel becomes dry and, for me, almost undrinkable.  A re-review is in order.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Aroma of lemon, lemon zest, yeast, off-dry white wine, varous spices and a nice earthiness to it all.  Taste is very much an ashy-spicy-alcoholic belgian trippel (or strong blond) - the alcohol isnt shy and the spice and herbal taste keep things interesting.  Very lively mouthfeel.

Lemons abound in the nose - squeezed lemons, lemon buttercream and white birthday cake with lemon frosting.  Other aroma accents attributed to cloves and pepper, forming a very bright and floral fragrance.  Flavor leads in with sweet lemon meringue, shortbread, lemon grass and herbal buttered crescent rolls.  Highly yeasty - first and foremost - with a cloves, pepper and chamomile spiciness to compliment a bitterness boding well with the taste buds.  Nice candi sugar dimensions.  Effervescence is well in tune with how Id like my palate to react.  Slightest kiss of herbal bitterness and musky malt profiling, finishing like a chomp of musky cologne and trace elements of pepper.

Beer is of a deeper golden color with plenty of spontaneous carbonation (but not compared to some other tripels); has a solid off-white head that lasts to the end of the glass. Flavor is a refreshing surprise as it totally transcends the basicality of the aroma/appearance. The first sip brings one inside an old brewery, and the second sip elevates on the high carbonation. Flavor elements are very fruity-malt but plenty of hops shine through as do some spices, perhaps cardamom and clove. At even a slightly cooled temperature the alcohol is mostly invisible except on the finish -- which has an extremely raw quality overall, like back to the walls of that old brewery. All in all, a profound experience ... as of the first sip.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","BeerAteHer"

The mouthfeel is thick but very tingly from the massive carbonation and tart flavors. As with the nose, the predominant flavors are those of spices and citrus, but the yeast and high alcohol content (9%) are also distinctively present.

First smell impression is of a bit of orange juice, then diluted honey. Beyond the usual candi sugar taste is something complex and hard to distinguish; a horsey bit, perhaps, and staled hops. As I go further down, it gets pretty heady. Picks up a bit of a wit note, too, leading to a white wine finish. The bottle was dated ""best by 11-17-07,"" so Im guessing its pretty young, and may have been different just a few months later.

3245,"2005-06-18",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2005 Tasted this one late into a cold winters night. Right choice as it had an uncharacteristically warming alcohol feel to it that did its job in keeping me cosy. Poured into a short tulip glass just below room temperature, a good-sized dense off-white head formed atop an opaque deep gold body. The head lasted the distance, added texture to the mouth feel and left a lovely Belgian lace down the glass. Biting spicy alcohol phenols initially hit dead into the olfactory nerves, and sent a flow through my body. This waned a little in the glass to be replaced with sweet toffee and vanilla notes, cloves and light fruity esters. Creamy and smooth in the mouth, medium bodied and light in carbonation. Well balanced and blended flavours, spicy and peppery across the tongue. Leafy dry hops, low in bitterness and background to the  vanilla, toffee, creamed honey and phenolic alcohol feel of this warming, smooth Tripel.

Nice soft carbonation (but the bottle I had was left on the window sill, and it froze, with a little bit leaking out of the cork). A slight dryness about it, probably because of the sediment.

Pours a hazy pale gold with a rich snowy white head. Very lacy. Smells like spicy sour apples. Yeasty and fruity.

Taste is heavenly. Frtuity apple in the body underpinned by sweet spicy flavors. Sour malt and yeast to finish. Smooth. And then very slowly, very subtly, the beer shifts into another gear and that dull alcohol warming comes through in the aftertaste. Its a thing of beauty.

Its one of those wonderfully complex aromas that rewards each sniff with something new. Full-bodied and beautifully rounded. On the tongue it shows orange peel, honey, cloves and zesty hops - spice is the dominant theme. The 9% alcohol comes through in the swallow but carries it off better than most beers of this abv.

3245,"2005-01-11",4.6,"UPDATED: JUN 8, 2014 8/2011. I have been drinking this beer regularly since 2001. It is one of my staples and my beer fridge is never without a couple of bottles of this one. Even before my all consuming passion for good beer took hold I was drinking this one and their Trois Pistoles. To me this is one of the shining examples of the majesty that is the Tripel style. +++ Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this fine brew pours an opaque bright orange color with a large white head. The aroma is strong and has a strong yeasty element and notes of pear, apples and spice. The mouthfeel is thick and the flavor is strong with sweetness. There are strong yeasty tastes and ripe fruit - pear, apple and maybe a hint of apricot. There is a mild dry spicy finish that is stark contrast to the sweet beginning and middle.  The 9% alcohol is well hidden in this beer.  In short this is a fabulous beer and one of my dear favorites.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"

3245,"2004-10-23",4.0,"The bottle started foaming immediately after I opened it so I quickly poured the beer into my Chimay Trappist glass and watched the outrageous carbonation go to work. This beer pours a rich golden hue with a quickly dissipating white head (no lacing), thousands of Champagne character bubbles, and small chunks of sediment suspended throughout the body. Initially the nose is very yeasty and Champagne-like but after a few sniffs heavy malt fragrance, sweet fruit, and alcohol aromas make their own appearances. Any hops aroma is sadly absent. Flavor, yeasty, hoppy, and malty; this beer has a very well rounded palate! Initially I was impressed as all hell and after closer inspection here is what I found: Alcohol flavor is quite pronounced throughout the palate. While yeast flavors dominate the first sip, subsequent sips reveal an abundance of hops and malt flavor. Finish is dry with a satisfying bite at the very end. Overall, I have mixed feelings about this beer but Im glad I had a chance to try it. Id drink it again, but it would have to be on just the right occasion....

Aroma is perfumey-sweet with notes of bananas, grapes, cane sugar, and hay.  In short, what I expect from a Belgian, but without the funky sour notes.

Taste is sweet (pears, apples, caramel, cherry) with a dose of lime-lemon sourness.  There is also a peppery zest in the aftertaste.  The overall taste is a bit milder than I anticipated.  There is a lot of creamy smoothness, and a mellow blended quality with none of the flavors stepping in front as dominant.

This is a very nice take on a Belgian Strong Pale Ale, but is not quite in the same class as the great Duvel.  I do hope the  new owners of Unibroue leave this one alone.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

3245,"2004-04-30",3.5,"750ml bottle.  A hazy yellow-coloured ale that pours with a white, frothy (almost fizzy) head that mostly collapses.  The aroma is citrusy, but with a herbal characterlemongrass, maybe?with some lightly biscuity notes there as well.  Light-to-medium body with a very lively carbonation that moderates somewhat to reveal a slightly syrupy body.  The brisk carbonation competes with the flavour and inhibits appreciation of the crisp, dry, hay- and straw-like malt character, and the sweetly acidic lemon, apple, and celery tastes.  Coriander and peppery spiciness is fairly restrained.  Increasingly dry finish highlights the herbal, grassy hoppiness.  The bottle gushed upon opening, so the racy carbonation may have simply gotten carried away in this particular bottle.  Will re-rate if this is the case.  Good, but there are better Belgian-style strong blond ales.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Wheatsheaf"
3245,"2004-04-29",2.8,"When the news broke about Sleeman taking over Unibroue I thought, oh well, its not the end of the world. Well, while this one is I hope that its age has something to do with the quality of this beer. I bought this from a grog shop which used to be known for its great variety of beers. Now it is concentrating on wine and so I only found this after a bit of poking around. It was sitting there with 2 of its colleagues and so I thought it was a bargain to buy 3 for $10. My first point before reviewing this is therefore that I had tried a beer of indeterminate age, but given that this is on lees I would have thought that age would not weary, but improve this beer. Anyway it poured as a medium orange beer with a thin head. Very low in carbonation too. The nose is a pleasant light sultana with fleeting citrus notes. The flavour may be the result of bottle time as this has a distinctive sherry like character with a bit of mustiness. The body for this ABV is surprising as it tastes quite thin. The dry back palate is acceptable but apart from the alcohol kick that eventually arrives I dont feel it really be the end of the world if Sleeman makes changes to the Unibroue range.

Unfortunatly the flavor (which stands on its own qute well) was too mild compared to the Maudite I was sampling alongside it.  I'd expect a trippel to have some more punch compared to its darker (yet lower ABV) cousins.  The muskiness of the aroma carries all the way to the finish.  I'd consider this a highly refined beer that has accompished its design as a canadian version of a belgian trippel.

Unfiltered, ugly cloudy yellow, but that head is massive and very impressive. Foamy, creamy off white, lacing beautifully.

Strong alcohol in the nose. This beer smells much better from about a foot away then it does wafting right under my nose. From a foot away, this beer smells pretty nice- not that it's bad close up, but it's strongly scented- alcohol and banana.

Heavy coriander aroma leaves me literally salivating.  Some hops in there as well.  Taste is mostly of coriander with a slight hint of hops initially and berries in the finish.  This beer was out of the fridge for an hour and 20 minutes before I drank it.  This is a good beer, but is not in the same league as Allagash Tripel Reserve.

Begins very spicy and rich with some bitter alcohol notes, the finish is quite unique though, has almost a minty fresh appeal, like a cold shot of mint vanilla hitting the back of your throat.  Then it turns in to a very fuzzy warm alcohol flavor with plenty of candied sugar and yeasty goodness.  Moderately astringent up front and alcohol could be better masked.

Flavor is much the same, though this one seems to get too dry and bitter/acidic.  Very champagne-like in both flavor and mouthfeel.

Not as sweet as I would have thought, a good amount of warming alcohol, noble hoppiness.

Alcohol is a touch prominent when you first start but mellows wonderfully as the glass goes on. Has the basic characteristics of a Belgian tripel - dry alcohol balanced by sweet pale malt with moderate hop bitterness and light spicy notes.

Alcohol, clove, peppery flavor, but not as complex as I'd like it.  The fruitiness in the aroma doesn't quite carry through to the flavor, at least not as much.

3245,"2002-12-28",4.0,"Re-Rate 12/28/02: One sip of a Unibroue beer several years ago started a continuous love affair with this brewery, and the whole line of their beers, La Fin Du Monde was that first beer, what a stroke of luck that was for this Grizzled Old Beer Swiller.
As it pours from the bottle, a slightly hazy lemon yellow, the head creamy in texture, the size masterful, the color a brilliant white, as it evanesces it leaves a silky sheet of fine lace to cover the glass.  The aroma of finely malted grains dominates the nose, citrus crisp, lightly sweet and a pleasure to the senses. Ambrosial start with lots of malt, the top middling in its feel with a spirited acidity, masterfully hopped, and a long drawn-out aftertaste that is dry. The 9% ABV, make this a real Belly Warmer, for these cold winter days and nights, a beer I love, and I always have a few bottles on hand as they age gracefully and I wish I could say the same for my own self. Ranks #282 on my current 1000 beer master list.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

3245,"2002-12-05",3.6,"Very interesting to say the least. I needed to back off on my pouring a few times because the mighty head nearly overflowed. This one poors a cloudy mustard yellow with a huge head that will die down quickly after a sip or two and leave a nice creamy layer. The aroma is that of a mild malt mixed in with something of a nutmeg smell. The taste is very powerful as many have pointed out with a considerable tasting of that extra yeast and alcohol. The palate however is very happy with this rogue aftertaste, its a pleasant surprise, and once again, another above average blonde. I guess i will have to take back my original statement that the only thing good to ever come out of Canada was William Shatner...i guess Unibroue deserves a place up there too. Probably the biggest downer for this beer is the overwhelmingness of the yeast left from the triple fermentation process..sort of makes one cringe from time to time but gets better with every sip. Another must try again.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

First rated 9/20/2002 3.5 Faint hazy yellow brown under a shortish lasting off-white crusty bubbled head. Fine specks of beige sediment. Faint soapy sappy hops aroma warming to a medium strong cirtus honey and caramel malty, spicey golden syrup, especially when glass is swirled. Medium body with medium strong wheat, lemon and honey flavours do a fair job of masking the high ABV. Spices  (coriander and nutmeg?) linger in finish and aftertaste.

3245,"2002-11-02",3.6,"Not as good as I remembered it this is still a fine drink and a blessing to New World fans of Belgian style brewing, as is Unibroue in general. The beer pours with an active but short-lived head, though retaining enough to enhance the mouthfeel. Aromas of citrus and spice, dominate along with a hearty maltiness, grassy herbal notes and earthy yeast. The beer remains a milky sedimented yellow/amber - at least it does if you pour the yeast, as I did. There is a definite lemony quality to the beer, herbal? - lemon verbena , lemon grass, etc. Bready banana and honey flavors, plenty of malt, enough tartness for contrast and complexity and a fairly clean finish. Nonetheless, I dont think its Unibroues best.","Illinois, USA","DavefromChicago"

3245,"2002-10-30",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 18, 2011 Re-rate 12/18/11: It had been a while since Id had this, so I figured it was time for a rerate.  12oz bottle, best by 7/27/14.  Pours a slightly hazy bright golden with a pillowy froth of clingy-lacing white head.  Has a floral bready nose with some light wheaty sweetness and banana esters with a touch of cloves.  Starts with good fullness and fine carbonation with a pleasant biscuity sweetness and mild bitter balance with some orange citrus and clove spice.  Finishes smooth and bittersweet, hiding the alcohol well.  Very true to style and enjoyable.

Original rating 10/30/02: Butterscotch aroma and cloudy golden body.  Solid fruity and malty flavor masks most of the alcohol and the finish is dry and clean.  It doesnt quite have the aged oilyness in the palate many of the better Belgian ales have, but hey, its not the end of the world, so sit back and enjoy it, because its still a respectable brew.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

Huge aroma full of ginger, peach, pepper, vanilla, mango, green olive, lemon zest, wood, and some toastines; there are also some subtle phenolic hints.  Medium-full palate with yeasty softness.  Moderately complex flavors of anise, peach, zucchini bread, honey, white grape, kiwi, and black pepper.  Perhaps this boasts more tropical fruitinesss than any other Triple I have experienced.

Immediately I cursed myslef for only having ten dollars and not having the internet on my cell phone to see which product was the one to get!  Ah well, this one was definately a good choice.  Light golden in appearance with a cloudy haze, this brew reminded me somewhat of Duvel.  A buttery soft, lasting head came up nicely from the yellow liquid.  Pears, apple and wet dog were all appearant in the initial nosing.  As the beer warmed, alcohol made its presence as well, though not too much.  Beautifully balanced with a palate wetting hop bite. Wonderful.  alcohol is there in the first few sips, but is soon put in its place by the complexities this beer holds onto throughout the glass.

A complex and excellent beer. The aroma was lightly floral and yeasty (soap). I detected aged apples, lemon and an unfamiliar, very pleasant spice in the nose. This masterpiece has a murky golden hue with a large, rocky white head. No lacing, but fully lasting. Deliscious. Very malty, but well balanced. Not sweet.  A touch sour (I dig that) with hints of citrus and alcohol. The 9% ABV is fairly well hidden. Medium body with a creamy mouthfeel. Lively carbonation.

Many spices in the aroma including coriander, clove, pepper, and maybe cumin.  Awesome appearance!  Nice golden hazy look with a medium head. (must drink in the propper belgian glass)  Fizzy and carbonated but not overly so- which makes it more drinkable.  Reminds me somewhat of a delerium tremens but this is much much better.  Lots of belgian biscuit and aromatic malts in the flavor to balance out all the spices.  Im assuming some hallertau or saaz was used but in moderation.   Yeasty, almost breadlike taste and aroma comes through very well, but is not overbearing.  As it warmed, a little more bubblegum flavors came through in the flavor.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain), lightly hoppy (herbs, lemon), moderately yeasty (basement), with notes of alcohol, pepper, apple, gum. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively/soft carbonation, moderately alcoholic. A decent enough rendition...a little apple in the nose, but otherwise attractive with decent yeast and pepper notes. Good flavor balance as well, nice dryness in the finish. A little too watery with poor carbonation makes the mouthfeel less than desired, but ultimately its a fairly good tripel (whereas all too many are sugar/booze bombs).","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

This bottle poured   with a fair bit of chill haze, which cleared as the beer warmed to a gorgeous gold with hints of orange. The head was large, white, and creamy, with moderate to good longevity. 

Aroma started fairly closed, with hints of bready malt and a touch of flowery perfume. As it warmed, the maltiness came out, along with big flowery hops, hints of coriander, clove, and citrus. The alcohol also becomes apparent in the nose as it warms. 

Body is quite full, with fine, strong carbonation and a mouth-coating finish.

When cold, the flavor is subdued, clean, starting moderately sweet and finishing somewhat bitter. After warming to appropriate drinking temp, the sweetness dominates, along with strong citrus and flowery notes.

3245,"2002-04-19",3.9,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2004 Apr 02:  750 ml bottle.  I have to say at the outset that this bottle was very flat.  I mean, no carbonation at all, no bubbles, nada.  So I was prepared for the worst, but happily it was semi-salvageable.  Opaque amber/orange color reminds me of apple juice; nose, too, is fruit-like for the most part:  lemony wit characteristics melding with apricot and apples.  Nice, but not strong enough.  Flavor & texture definitely hurt by the loss of spritz; it's intensely malty and sweet with virtually no hop character.  Drunk at cellar temp, tolerable, but as it warmed it became quite cloying and viscous.  The nice cider-like notes and faint herbal qualities I feel hallmark a special beer; unfortunately, my bottle was simply dead.  A mixed review, then, but I will certainly try to find a good bottle someday; given the brewer's other works, it will probably be worth it. 7/3/5/2/11=2.8

May 04:  Hazy spun gold, webs of yeast within, fully lasting creamy small head.  Lovely yeasty apple-bread nose, thick hugely malty body has notes of apple, lemon chiffon cake, pepper...

3245,"2002-04-17",3.4,"Very cloudy appearance with a few dark flakes of yeast in there. I wonder how many yeasts they actually use: the French on the bottle says a special strain of yeast and the English says a blend of special yeasts. Anyway. I got peanuts, orange and alcohol in the aroma. Flavour has a lot of honey (of the strong weirdo flowers variety), buttered corn on the cob, and peanuts with the skins still on. Texture is strangely tongue-coating and fatty. Finishes dry. Overall a curious creature, not as hoppy as i remembered from last time - but then I had a 2 year old bottle this time round so it must have mellowed.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"

3245,"2001-05-04",4.3,"Wow.  Very nice, very smooth beer.  Fruity and refreshing, smell great.  A little sour on the palate, but that I suspect is from the high alcohol content.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"

3245,"2001-03-19",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 12, 2011 Pleasant beer with nice yeast flavors and aromas. Hints of white pepper, spices and herbs create a delicate complexity that complements well with the malts and warming alcohol. Could do without the twist-off caps on the 12-ounce bottles ... who would drink this beer from the bottle anyway?","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

3245,"2000-12-11",3.9,"Great smell, like sour green apples and grain alcohol mixed together.  Sour flavor with a nice alcohol warming, carbonated a little bit too much which made it a bit rough on the palatte, but overall a fine beer.","Georgia, USA","young"

3245,"2000-10-26",4.0,"Hazy straw color; very fizzy to style; malty / spicy nose; 9% alcohol comes through immediately on first sip; wide complexity of flavors from spices, vanilla, clove, lemon and banana with mild lactic sourness; moderate late hop presence with long spicy hop finish.

3245,"2000-08-07",3.5,"This beer looks great in the glass.  Its that perfect wheat malt and yeasty cloudy color.  It tastes somewhat like a highly alcoholic Paulaner Hefe-Weizen, though its actually a triple.  Not bad, but its not a guzzling beer, or one you can likely drink more than one of.  I prefer Maudite over this.","Portland, Maine, USA","Sammys"

Pleasant malty aroma.
First sip is alcohol and yeast.  A very
powerful beer.
It remains yeasty and malty.
This is a very good beer, but its definitely
hard to drink more than one.
Probably would not pair well with food.
wow.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
