2338,"2016-12-22",4.7,"Pours a warm copper brown with amber highlights; thick & dense beige head; moderate amounts of lace. Aromas include dark breads, nuts, brown sugar, caramel, maple syrup, spices, and toffee. Incredibly complex flavors; it arrives with some nuts & spices and transitions smoothly into a malty middle with sugary/syrupy notes. The finish is rich with dark fruits, more syrupy, and caramel notes that are riding on a long, boozy hold on the palate. As the beer warms, different flavors will pop out with each new sip; the sweetness & booziness eventually takes over. Very highly carbonated right after the pour and holds for a bit; this keeps the beer crisp & lively for longer. The body is full. The finish is mildly sticky and very warm from the alcohol. Amazing & delicious but definitely a sipper (considering the size of the bottle & the ABV). Perfect for the winter season and is a fine example of the Belgian Strong Dark Ale style.

Elle est précisée par le brasseur comme « the strongest belgian christmas ».
Je lai choisie quant à moi pour fêter mon 500ème rate de bière belge sur ratebeer... On fait plus mal comme choix  et je me permettrai de dédier
ce rate à un ami avec qui jai fait un passage mémorable au Troll et Bush de chez Dubuisson il y a quelques années (il se reconnaîtra), et ce jour-là jai dailleurs emporté 2 bouteilles de Bush de Nuits que lon inaugurait ...
Bouteille de 75 cl, sérigraphiée et ayant dépassé de 9 mois sa date limite.
Couleur brun roux tendance auburn.
Clarté nette, et même grande transparence de ce breuvage. Ce qui est très amusant au vu de son degré alcoolique et de son âge...
Bulles moyennes peu nombreuses (normal).
Mousse qui ne peut résister au 13 % qui poussent derrière 
Arômes de fruits des bois, Margaux, poire au vin, bois dacajou.
1ère bouche au volume souple à soyeux, sur des fruits noirs, du fût de vin en chai de grande maison.
Arrière-bouche maltée, chaude, aux nuances vineuses.
2ème sur le vin rouge fort, la lie de vin, le fût de vin (et pas la bibine de la vigne à papa...).
3ème bouche aussi large que les orages sur 100 kms en montagne, quand on les voit depuis chez soi...
Arrière-bouche de porto, whisky dIslay très vieux, Margaux très âgé.
La longueur donne des pointes de muscade et de poivre noir du moulin sur des 
malts très complexes. Du bois de fût splendide, qui fait littéralement rêver, on est strictement dans lexceptionnel. On trouve aussi des pointes de bois blanc de grande forêt dont on fait les merrains. Cest prodigieux.
La levure est une pure merveille aux mille nuances, et qui les transmet donc à la bière 
Lalcool, à ce niveau abv, on parle dexception, mais son travail est merveilleux
dans laccompagnement des saveurs. (Petite parenthèse, pour preuve de sa 
qualité, le lendemain matin vous êtes frais comme un gardon, sans aucune problématique à la carapace... et cest suffisamment important pour être signalé).
La finale est sans mots, donc ineffable, grandiose, à susurrer !!!
CONCLUSION : bière « noble » par excellence. La qualité des saveurs fait partie du plus haut niveau de la dégustation des grands vins. Quelle récompense que de pouvoir fêter mon 500ème rate belge avec un pareil breuvage, qui est un pur élixir. On peut parler dune quintessence de bière...
Son évaluation à 500 sur 100 me paraît non seulement juste mais très adaptée 
à la circonstance...","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

This beer was completely new to me, I initially wondered even whether or not this wasnt simply a renamed version of the regular Noël but apparently this is the same beer but re-fermented in the bottle which is quite interesting. In hindsight I do sort of wish that I had either a better recollection of the regular version or that I had tasted them alongside. I did look up my old notes which sort of helped me to recall the taste of the old version, unfortunately my notes back then tended to be less elaborated than my current ones frequently are. Either way it pours a dark red amber with a white head on the sides. The beer is probably not too far from room temperature. Smell is that of sweet caramel, syrup, herbal with dark fruits. Taste is unfortunately held back a bit by a surplus of carbonation, bit of a pet peeve of mine, bitter herbs & spices, sticky malts, dark fruits, tad liquorice, brown sugar, yeast overripe fruits & some minor booze. This is a bit too fizzy for me, the regular version is less subtle but if memory serves me right, this one is slightly less my thing, it is still not too shabby.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
