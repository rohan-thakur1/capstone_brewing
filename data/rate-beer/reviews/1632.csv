1632,"2016-08-22",2.1,"Odorless. Colorless, save for the faintest yellowish hue, crystal clear. Almost flavorless initially, but notes of spearmint, honey and airplane glue build toward a warm flavorless finish. Drinks like water. No off flavors, but fairly tame. Almost quaffable.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"

1632,"2014-12-27",2.4,"300ml bottle (the 200e of overpriced shit session)
Slightly fruity aroma, some apple, but a bit thin. Taste-wise, iss even thinner, but given that its 13+% thats quite OK. Thin, but alcohol well hidden. Vote for overpriced: 5/5 but I could have some more with sake.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
1632,"2014-06-21",3.2,"The aroma of this sake has some rice notes. As I sip, I notice the taste of apple as well. The taste is balanced. The finish is somewhat bitter. Still, this is a rather good sake.","Valley City, North Dakota, USA","benfergy"
1632,"2011-11-08",3.1,"Bottle.  Pours clear with a slightly golden yellow hue to it.  Softly floral, gentle rice, fruit, a touch of melon.  Oily smooth, very light and delicate flavors of rice, a soft warmth.  Not a lot going on flavorwise though.  A touch of acidity on the finish, gentle warming alcohol.  Slight nuttiness.

1632,"2009-09-20",3.3,"This bottled sake from a restaurant poured no head and left behind a uncarbonated clear colored body. The aroma was mild rice. The smooth mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a low alcohol burn. The flavor contained notes of mild alcohol and polished rice. A smooth easy drinking decent sake that I would consider buying again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

White fruit flesh. Bits of seaweed. I cant decide if the crisp, gritty character is pleasing or coarse. Clean cucumber. Bright and glimmering. Interesting.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Non-offensive to the max, this didnt last long in my drinking vessel...

Aromas include some grape, light alcohol, and some melon rind...

has some slight burn, 12% seems right...

Flavours of rice, rind, things like that...

like water down the throat, a dangerously drinkable sake.. pretty good actually but lacks complexity...",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
1632,"2007-10-10",2.8,"330 ml bottle. Grassy, honeydew aroma. Slightly salty. Pretty weak flavor, a touch of koji, a bit of alcohol, very watery. Kind of tastes like vodka, although much less strong. Ive had much better, especially for a 12% sake.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
1632,"2007-04-01",2.5,"Clear with little or no legs.  The alcohol vapors are there but in check.  The flavor is light white grape, light rice, light sweet melon...followed by light alcohol burn.

1632,"2006-08-19",2.8,"This was my first sake, and I wasnt sure what to expect. Started out a clear pour, with minimal aroma, except for a hint of rice. Initial sips were some rice and some water, but basically smooth. Deeper into the glass, the 12% alcohol became more and more apparent, until at the end, I felt like I was drinking moonshine,. Thank God there was not a candle on the table, or I think the glass may have blown up. It was pure fuel at the end. Ill probably try a different sake some time, but if this is the norm, Ill pass.","Dacula, Georgia, USA","kimcgolf"
1632,"2006-03-17",3.6,"Mild aromas of melon and grass.  Crystal clear.  Very smooth.  Some hints of grassiness and melon again in the taste and a definite note of riciness.  I think this is a very nice sake.","USA","smcd"
1632,"2006-03-17",1.7,"Bottle  Pours just liike every other sake in the world- almost without color.  Resembles semi-dirty dishwater.  Aroma is a pungent white grape with rice vinegar undertones.  Flavor is a starkly brazen rice pudding, with notes of cheap white wine.  Palate is almost forgettable.  Im no sake expert, but I can say Ive had better than this.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"
1632,"2004-12-11",2.5,"Always interesting to sample sakes, as the flavors are just so utterly different from what you find anywhere else.  Clear, a bit thin.  Very faint melon aroma.  Interesting flavors emerged, involving hyacinth flowers, corn husk, and marshmallow.  Not a ""clean"" flavor like you find in some sake, but the alcohol was noticably utterly absent.  Wouldnt get this again, but happy to have tried it.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
