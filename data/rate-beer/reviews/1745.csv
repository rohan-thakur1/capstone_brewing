1745,"2015-09-30",3.5,"The new wave of Dutch craft breweries are beginning to tackle every style in existence it seems, in much the same way the American craft beer renaissance highlighted long forgotten styles. This is Maximus take on the American amber lager style, maybe inspired by Brooklyn Lager, a familiar sight in the Netherlands nowadays? Anyway, tasted this at De Goudse Eend in Gouda, thanks Stefan for sharing. Lacing, thick, snow white head, hazy amber robe. Aroma of caramel, dough, wet straw, hint of gin and some burning plastic (perhaps DMTS?). Clean, crisp onset with only some malt fruitiness (not unexpected from a lager, of course), medium carbo, smooth mouthfeel consisting of supple caramelly malts; the American twist, rather than an original Vienna lager character, comes forward in the long, spicy hop bitterness in the end.
