4446,"2017-06-15",4.5,"(Sample from 750ml bottle @ Koelschip tasting, May 11/17) Pours hazy light gold. Aroma is beautifully tart and heavily floral passion fruit, its not as musky as Im used to, but instead feels fresh, bright and juicy. Sweet, with a citrusy backbone. Flavour is also so wonderfully floral and fruity, perfumed, lovely, with supporting accents of sweet peach/mango, but balanced with a tart lemon/orange acidity. Soft bitterness. Light oak and hay characteristics let the lambic base shine through. Medium bodied, soft carbonation that slightly prickles. Maybe the Spontan series has somewhat reduced the apparent novelty of lambic like this, but this is the real deal and superbly well executed, very high quality fruit. Loved this!","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"
