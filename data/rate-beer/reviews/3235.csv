Golden in color, clear with a thin head. Light hops and malt aroma.  Taste was quenching and was one that you would get from a lager in Mexico.  Nice easy drinking beer.  Great for the hot day.","Olympia, Washington, USA","BrewDad"

3235,"2011-06-07",3.7,"On tap. Pours with a completely clear yellow body with a somewhat large and surprisingly long lasting white head. Aromas are decently hoppy, lightly herbal, lemon, soap, grainy and clean. Lasting floral notes. Absolutely no DMS. Flavors are bready, quite malty (very nice), floral and slightly hoppy. Light minerality. Medium bitterness with a pretty neutral balance. Very clean. Fizzy, dry, malty and tasty. Really well put together. A very nice lager!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
3235,"2011-05-12",2.6,"Tap @ Bittercreek: Pours a clear gold color with a thin white head. The nose is light and grainy with a light biscuit and toast note, some thin husky notes and a light crisp hop quality. Fresh mouthfeel and a clean flavor with a refreshing light toasty finish. Light body. Not bad.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3235,"2011-02-18",3.8,"On tap at the brewery. Reviewed from notes.

Pours a light yellow with a nice, billowing whore head and a decent dose of lace. Nose brigs some nice grain characteristics and doesnt have any sort of cardboard or other off flavors, which is slays a plus with this style. Taste is quite plain with a bit of bread, which is enhanced by some prickly carbonation. Light body and really smooth overall. A nice offering and something I wouldnt mind seeing more craft breweries experimenting with.

Malty and lager tastes with a light floral presence.  Just a slightly more intense pale lager from what I can tell.  This has been on the site for a while, yet no one has rated it...  odd.  Just like the name.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
