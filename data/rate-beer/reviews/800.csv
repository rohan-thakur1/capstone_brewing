800,"2012-08-09",3.3,"500ml swingtop bottle pours a brownish color with a finger and a half of off-white head that leaves some decent lacing on the glass.  Aroma is mild chocolate and roasted grains with hints of banana and cloves.  Taste is roasted grain bitterness with some chocolate and caramel malty sweetness with hints of banana and cloves in the finish.  Medium bodied with light carbonation.  As far as dunkelweizens go, this one is pretty dam good.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
800,"2009-12-25",3.4,"Ceramic swing top bottle. Pours a hazy brown with golden highlights. Low aroma of chocolate , banana, and spices. even after breathing a while the aromas remained muted. Freshness may be an issue here. The flavours are nice: chocolate, estery banana, cloves, and a woody/reedy element that lends a real rustic character to this beer. Tasty, but I bet it would be better if Id had this on tap.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
800,"2009-12-16",3.8,"In short: A by-the-book Dunkel Weisse of superior quality.
How: Bottle 500ml swing-top.  Consumed fresh soon after its release.  Sent to me by Presario, thanks a lot Trevor.
The look: Cloudy brown body topped by a small beige head.
In long: Nose of toasted wheat and clove.  Body is pleasantly full without being heavy.  Ripe banana peels, cloves, chestnuts, earth, milk chocolate, a little caramel, tree branches, tree roots.  An overall pleasant dirty sensation with a strong forest floor character.  Wow, what a pleasant surprise.  This was a great brew from a brewery I usually dont care about, in a province that does not produce good beer and in a style I usually dont care for.  Im now thinking that maybe I should check out Garth Brooks country Christmas album.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
800,"2009-12-15",3.9,"Pours a dark brown with an almond head.  Aroma is sweet with malt and cloves.  Taste is very nice.  A nice full body that is pleasant on the palate.  Citrus bite with malt flavours  and caramel.  Just all around a really great beer.  Thanks to presario for this!","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","cfrancis"
800,"2009-11-13",3.9,"A: Great appearance on this beer. Poured with an average-sized, tan head. Good traces of lace left on the glass through drinking. Body is murky and cloudy (virtually opaque), and a dark brown color.

S: Aroma is a little weak, but I can detect traces of cloves, as well as some smokiness.

T: Chocolate comes through first, followed by cloves. A little banana in there too, I think. Flavor is overall moderately sweet with a medium-lasting duration.

M: Medium-bodied and creamy, with a soft carbonation.

D: Wow, this is a really good beer. Probably my favorite Wild Rose to date. Go get it on tap while its still in season!","New Brunswick, CANADA","Berley31"
800,"2009-11-08",3.0,"Pours deep brown tall thick head.Malty yeasty aroma. Tastes very roasty and malty not much of a wheat flavour. Slightly spicy not a bad beer but its a bit thin I was expecting mare body.",", Alberta, CANADA","Cole"
800,"2009-10-29",4.1,"A good malt smell but I get a huge rush of fieldberries?? Also a bit of a burnt malt smell. Very fruity smelling. Pours dark and think even in a weizen glass, you cant see through the thin part. Nice head, thins slowyly. The flavour is sweet similar to the smell but there is no sweet berry taste, you get the dark malt flavour and sweetness blended oh so smoothly with the yeast feel and slow easing off of the palate. No real aftertaste. There is a certain sourness in the flavour that Im sure is supposed to be there but that is why I dont rate it higher, considering the other numbers I gave.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","TheHulk"
800,"2009-10-04",3.5,"Pours a chestnut colour with a one inch tan coloured head. The aroma has chocolate, banana, coffee, and earthy tones. It tastes like chocolate covered bananas with a spicy earthy finish. Creamy mouth feel. Nice.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","hobbersr"
800,"2009-10-01",3.1,"Coca-cola like colour with a hearty tall and thick head. Mustard, dark roast coffee, paint thinner nose. Black coffee and tarty malt mouth. Cooler and light near the end and finish has a dusty mouth coating showing evidence of a thick beer. Very lightly carbonated.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","Powertrip"
800,"2009-09-21",3.5,"I was a little dissapointed by this beer. Pour is pure dark brown with a soft tannish head. Aroma of chocolate, banana, coffee and malts. Taste is malty and rich barley, chocolate and caramel tones. A rich and flavourful beer with a touch of ununusual aftertaste of spiciness.","Alberta, CANADA","patricks110"
800,"2009-09-06",3.4,"On tap outdoors at the brewery. Dark brown. A little cloudy and even muddyish in the bottom of the glass. Fair head with stacks of bubbles more than foam. A little bit of banana and light smooth chocolate in a dusty yogurty cream body.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
800,"2009-09-01",3.6,"Draft at the brewery. Pours very hazy medium to pale brown, soft head, nice lacing. Nose is very estery, lots of bananas, fruit, chocolate. But very soft, mild, not as intense as some. Palate is more of the same, very heavy on the bananas, plus figs, milk chocolate, ashy in the finish. Not bad.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","Savvy1982"
800,"2009-08-29",3.7,"On cask at the Wild Rose Taproom during the beer launch. Unfiltered, pours an opaque medium chocolaty brown with only slight carbonation and a thin beige head. Aroma has a lot of chocolate overtop banana, wheat, cloves and a slight bit of lemon. Flavour is similar, with wheat and banana up front, followed by chocolate and caramel, finishing with clove and lemon-pepper notes. Medium bodied with a mouthfeel that reminded me of powdered milk, but not neccessarily in a bad way. Very tasty and a nice representation of the style.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","Maltybones"
