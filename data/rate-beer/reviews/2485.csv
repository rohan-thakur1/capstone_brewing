A: Poured a dirty mahogany with a large darker tan head. Not too much retention or lacing, but it still looks pretty nice.

S: Superb. Lots of black licorice, sweet malt, dark fruit, cherries, hints of smoke, some alcohol, and bits of chocolate.

T: Very, very intense all around. The black licorice, sweet malt, and dark fruits (plus cherries) stand out as being the most dominant, but this one has a lot going on and only gets better as it warms.

M: Good amounts of alcohol, but nothing distracting too much from the taste.

D: Excellent drinkability. High alcohol and insane complexity make this one a slow sipper.

The aroma is rich and seductive with molasses and some dark spice that I really dug (but cant name) interlaced with drawn caramel and chocolate.. warmth brought out a layer of plums and nutmeg.. this was endlessly-complex!  The flavor opened with the faintest tartness from plum skins and Turbinado sugars.. sweeter chocolates and drawn, toasty caramel grasp the center of the palate, and release a sweet blend of chocolate and caramel onto the back-end, which found those spices from the nose.. the warm, long finish was just exquisite.  Heavier-bodied with creamy carbonation on the palate, and the right components found the right parts of the mouth.  One question, though.. where the hell do they hide all that supposed alcohol?!?

Flavors followed down that same path, with plums and perhaps a touch of overly ripened banana in the fruit profile.  Burnt caramel weighs heavy on the tongue, seemingly enhancing the smooth, medium body.  Well blended as it is, the sweet fruity element is balanced out by the burnt sugar.  Very interesting brew.

The taste is roasty dark malty, figgy, chocoffy, with some lactic presence, a solid cherry element,  and a rauchy nutty presence.

Roasted grains and some subtle dark fruits. Tate is intense, roasted, fruity (but the fruit is subdued) with some nice vanilla and licorice (NOT anise) but actual licorice flavor. Also some figs and some woody hops in the aftertaste. This is an awesome world-class beer. Would love to taste it fresh at the brewery.","Oregon, USA","kenb"

The taste of this beer is very smooth, with chocolate, light banana, smoke, and light notes of vanilla.  Really well done.

Flavor is smokey, chocolate, lots of roasted notes, some raisin, a little bannana, some clove,  and some chocolate cupcake flavor on the finish.

Light alcohol in the nose.  The flavor was mildly tart with some malty sweetness as well and some fruit.  It appears to be thining out a little.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
2485,"2006-05-18",4.0,"Chocolate in color. Beautifully thick, rocky, and frothy light-tan head. Roasty aroma is lined with raisins, baked apples, tangy wheat, and burnt chocolate. Light dusting of clove and doughy yeast. Tight and creamy texture. Light bodied. Early edge of tartness dovetails with silky layers of chocolate and distant cola sweetness. Roasted malts deposit a chalky dryness, but it remains fairly soft despite this, thanks in large part to the complementary kiss of bananas bathing in bittersweet chocolate. Light in weight due to a tangy zip of wheat-derived acidity, but understatedly rich and satiating, still. Slightly chewy and cakey, too, which lends just enough girth to the body. Becomes chewier all around, as it warms, but the alcohol never flares up. Finishes pillow-soft with a doughy yeast foundation, as remnants of scratchy roast and burnt malt hulls trail close behind. Not the brightest or most complex, and the fact that the weizen elements are somewhat subdued doesnt help (the cloviness could use more poignancy and some juicy/floral hops would greatly deepen things), but Im hardly complaining. Another Ramstein beauty. Thanks a million, Dickinsonbeer!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2485,"2006-05-05",4.2,"Much thanks to dickinsonbeer for this much celebrated growler...
Appears a hazy dark brown with black noted colors in the outskirts. A 1 finger medium tan head slowly fades out. Scattered spots of lacing are left around the glass.
Smell is of chocolate, caramel, vanilla, clove, and raisins...very much the same as the Winter Wheat.
Taste is of the aforementioned aromas that seem to be held together nicely in a cocoa dusted wheat base.
Mouthfeel is spicey, with hints of the fruit and chocolate and a stickyness that seems appropriate with this concentrated brew.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"
2485,"2006-04-16",4.2,"Pours about the same as thier winter wheat, maybe a touch darker.  Deep dark brown almost black with a kickass deep beige head that lasts a while and has some good lacing.  My Growler was poured directly off the keg which still had the ice in it.  Even served at below freezing, this beer was phenomenal!  Initial aroma as it warmed to room temp was loaded with chocolate malts, figs, dried fruits, raisin, german yeast- banana clove etc.  Very similar to Schneider, except Ramstein is more complex and fuller in body and flavor.  Flavor is dark chewy malts, roasted barley, chocolate, bitter black malts, nutty, and more fruits like plum and apple with a slightly tart grape like character towards the end of the mouthfeel.  Towards the end, some fo the yeasty phenols and fusel alcohols come into play and create a spicy clove like character with some plasticy phenols.  Overall very smooth and dangerously easy to drink.  Greg told me that he estimated this years version to be over 12% abv.  Great stuff.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

2485,"2005-03-07",3.8,"Ruby coke brown, light quickly fading head. Strong coffee and tobacco aroma, very dry, enough that it creates a ashes-like aspect. Gentle woody component accompanies dark bitter chocolate, cocoa even. I must say Im a bit shocked at the almost total absence of any fruit hints. The malt is there most definitely, big, thick, but perhaps a little too dry for the beer to deserve its praise in my mind. Focus of flavours seems to be geared toward coffee, cigar and roasted chocolate. A beany aspect also gets uncovered after a few sips and bring up a vegetal tone that I could live without. Medium bodied, light to moderate carbonation level. Lets sum it up by saying this is a very stoutish eisbock which doesnt wear its 11.5% at all.

Hazy, unpasteurised and bottle conditioned.  Aroma is quite reminiscent of the Winter Wheat, but has a more pronounced tobacco and charred-wood aroma to it.  Some dry toffee, a touch of alcohol and bitter, dark chocolate.  Roasty, nutty, coffee-like notes as well.  Flavor builds off of the non-iced version, but takes the chocolate, tobacco and roast up a notch.  Theres more to sink your teeth in to on this one, with some dry, oily fruit flavors (grapeskin, currants, apples, some banana) on the finish.  Thick woodsmoke on the palate throughout, with a light saltiness and a bit of alcohol.

The body is the major difference.  I was expecting it to be thick and heavy, however it comes off as light but full.  Kind of like a whipped up egg white.  It stands up and coats your tongue and mouth.  You can feel the volume of it, but it isn't thick and heavy.

I have had the Aventinus recently, and this is WAY different. Aroma is nearly the same as the regular Winter Wheat. Clovey/chocolately and no real hint of alcohol. There is a slight and lasting head that is nice and brown. The color is pitch black. Now the fun begins. Flavor is smooth and creamy, almost to the point of being light and fluffy. Chocolate nmalt flavors dominate over the alcohol to the point of making this beer deadly. Where the Aventinus removes enamel, this satisfys one's thirst for beer.
