587,"2015-02-02",4.1,"Second 75cl bottle, bought at factory in Genoa and tasted at home.
Mahogany brown, deep and impenetrable.
Quite persistent, medium thickness pale nut foam.
Nice aroma of caramel and chocolate and a hint of coffee, malty, very fine.
It tastes rich, coffee and malt in evidence and chocolate that gives smoothness; pretty big body, quite strong but silky.
A beer above average for sure.","Genova, ITALY","IlCaffaro"
587,"2014-07-18",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Hazelnuts, caramel and dark rum are balanced out by alcohol warmth and minty herbs in this silky creation.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the dark amber.
-As with Maltus Faber brews, the rendering is flawless and elegant.
-This ones not necessarily aiming at the Dubbel style. Its doing its own thing, which I like.
-Mouthfeels not too heavy, with prickly carbonation.

587,"2014-01-11",3.7,"Bella schiuma alta, cremosa e lenta a scendere, colore bruno opalescente, aroma di frutta secca, note di dattero e caramello, al palato corpo medio e richiama laroma con note di noce, dattero , caramello ed un finale appena aspro e amaro on sentori di frutta di bosco. Essendo fatta in Italia mi ha colpito la qualità di questa dubbel, non sarà perfetta ma mi ha lasciato delle grandi sensazioni, spero di berne ancora.","ITALY","MatteoD."
587,"2011-12-13",4.8,"only 84??? ONE OF MY FAVOURITE DUBBEL!!! this beer has got a great fruity aroma and an incredible sweet fruity taste. Reddish-light brown colour. Dont worry for the quite body, this is an amazing abbey dubbel. Probably the master-brewer has came to study in a trappist monasterium in Belgium. This is an italian masterpiece. Other notes as malt and caramel. The end is very good with a touch of alcool and spices. SUPPORT this incredible microbrewery, the master-brewer is the nicest and most polite person in the world of beer!!! A MUST!","ITALY","Hellrob"
587,"2011-08-30",2.8,"750ml bottle with minimal graphic, reddish brown capsule; pours dark brown with a decent beige head, liquor looks very thick in the glass. Nose is dark and decently complex, with licorice and prunes, dark fruits and burnt caramel. Sweetness lingers in the mouth, leaving anyway space to a slightly bitter finish like sweetened coffee: the nose gave better expectations, and at each sip this brew feels a bit unrefined, maybe a bit too young (my fault). Body is effectively a bit sticky, not very Belgian I should say. A rather demanding strong ale, not an everyday beer as one could think. Never have been a fan of this genre unless examples shining for complexity or drinkability, and this is not the case either; sorry Maltus Faber, your ales are usually excellent but I did not dig this one that much.","ITALY","DesEsseintes"
587,"2011-06-01",3.2,"Color marrone scuro con bella schiuma beige. Aroma simile allo stile belga, caramello e cioccolata predominano. Anche in bocca è piacevole, dolciastra e bevibile, ma sul finire si notano sentori acidi e metallici che fanno scendere il livello complessivo della birra. Peccato perchè ammiro questo birrificio, ma ci può stare...","Firenze, ITALY","Wolfbass"

Poured murky, with a ruby-brown color and a nice beige lacing head. Spices, wood cask, forest berries, honey, plum cellar and red grapes in the aroma.

Nuttiness and some dark fruit emerge, and despite the thick, slick initial MF, the beer is very drinkable. Unfortunately, it falls flat at the end.
