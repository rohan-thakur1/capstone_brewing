4016,"2015-05-20",4.0,"Bottled on 4/8/15, conditioned in bottom of cold refrigerator until 5/20/15Well well, IÂ’m sitting here with the 205th Highest ranked beer in the world. ThatÂ’s no small feat. You have to get past the homers, the haters and the people that dont like IPAs or just had a bad batch....(and with this small, not quite overly consistent brewery, thatÂ’s saying a lot). I figured the tradeoff between not drinking an IPA as absolutely fresh as possible, and letting this massive hop particulate settle was high enough that it would be more enjoyable now; whether IÂ’m right or wrong IÂ’ll never know. The beer is certainly in lovely condition; down to an only slight haziness (mostly chill haze) with a massive, well-retained head.The aroma is all stone fruit and lime. I guess this hop is a hybrid of simcoe? It dosent have the sheer power and I guess that the best Simcoe IPAs easily out-aroma the best Mosaic IPAs. But of course, this is only the dry hop. Fort point itself adds plentiful mango, citrus and light pine. The pine is certainly there, but absolutely free of any resin or acidity. ItÂ’s as if theyÂ’ve centrifuged the acidity out of the beer. Watermelon, lime, and grapefruit continue. ItÂ’s certainly highly aromatic and sniffable, with soft, yet very apparent honeyed malts sitting in the background. I initially thought Fort Point a very dry pale ale; itÂ’s not. ItÂ’s a very, very hoppy pale ale that is completed by the sweet, succulent honey notes that remain mostly out-of-mind while the hops go to work on the palate. Extremely juicy, heavy watermelon, ruby red grapefruit and yet, dare I say, a bit too much malt sugar. I found it in the Double Dry Hopped version and here itÂ’s inescapable. As well, this is from the end of the second glass, when the beer is still quite chilled.Importantly, of course, itÂ’s not too sweet, in an overall sense. As with all of the best beers, this is nitpicking, but I think TrilliumÂ’s in a state where they are so far, far, far behind demand that they have neither luxury of changing their yeast aggressively nor giving extra conditioning time to their beers. And I wholeheartedly apologize if IÂ’m wrong, but thatÂ’s how it comes off to me. I get a bit of astringency/doughiness from most of their beers now, which works against the overall snappiness/crispness.That all aside, this is certainly a top-notch beer, and no doubt when they make their impending move, they are going to really shake up the Boston beer scene. This little brewery has done so much for Boston and the best is certainly yet to come (as cliche and lame as that sounds, itÂ’s true).As with all of their beers, the carbonation is perfect, with a soft, creamy texture and well-attenuated malts.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

4016,"2015-03-16",4.1,"Bottle dated 3/4/15. Pours like hazy cantaloupe juice, with just a few millimeters of off-white head. Aroma is intense, with huge candied cantaloupe and honeydew notes as well as mango, lychee, sweet orange, and dank and floral hops. A bit of funk, too, like overripe fruit. Been a while since IÂ’ve gotten such a nectar-y nose on a beer, and the melon notes are unusual. Taste is sweet orange, mango, and cantaloupe agua fresca. Grassy and honeyed finish, low bitterness, low to medium carbonation. Manages to somehow be sticky and oily while still drinking fairly light, though I wouldnÂ’t call it crisp. Remarkable beer Â– straight-up hop juice.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","dfroms"
