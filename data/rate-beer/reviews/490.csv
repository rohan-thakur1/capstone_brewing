490,"2015-04-21",3.0,"Aroma is fudge... amazing smell so much chocolate, taste is similar but fades fast, kinda like breakfast stout without the coffee, very thin and chalk finish","grand rapids, Michigan, USA","njager246"
490,"2014-04-23",3.9,"Tap @ Founders: Black, topped with a quickly dispersing khaki head that hangs around as a thin collar. Aroma of rich milk chocolate & fudge covered coffee beans, probably with a heavier hand towards the sweet chocolates. Flavor, on the other hand, leans more towards the coffee. LOTS of coffee bean flavor, background of dense fudge, burnt caramel, & toasty, roasted malts. Somewhat dry finish, though it remains sweet enough to get the point across. Really nice coffee brew from Founders, I expect no less.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

490,"2014-03-29",4.1,"Draft. Black pour, tan head. Little retention/some lace. Aroma of chocolate, espresso, fudge, vanilla, roast. Taste is lightly bitter, sweet, espresso, chocolate, coffee. Palate is soft, oily, light bitter finish.","Indiana, USA","tastybeer"
490,"2014-03-26",4.3,"From notes. On tap at Founders on March 19. The pour is black as night with a thinner dark khaki head and some good lacing. The aroma is pretty great. There is a phenomenal chocolatey fudge dominance up front with a good roasty coffee on the back end. The flavor is equally good. The coffee comes on a little strong, but the fudge and chocolateyness comes through great on the back. The mouth feel is pretty thin, but the coverage is surprisingly good with a carbonation that does leave something to be desired. The coffee-fudge aftertaste is just great. I love it!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
490,"2014-03-25",4.3,"Another great beer you can only get at the Founders Brew Pub. Very dark body. Intense flavor of coffee. The only time Ive had a beer with this much coffee flavor, the keg had a hop rocket loaded with coffee on it. Some chocolate flavors come through. Great beer.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","kkleu357"
490,"2014-03-25",3.8,"Dark black pour with oatmeal colored head a sixteenth inch thick. Great aroma of medium strength, smells just like chocolate covered coffee beans or a rich mocha espresso. Moderate carbonation, thick and creamy, slightly gritty mouthfeel, finish is reminiscent of coffees. Taste of really strong cold brewed coffee and dark chocolate, some lactose too. Great strong chocolate coffee stout, like a more bitter, molder roast of founders breakfast stout.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","bwa5879"

490,"2014-03-22",4.0,"Pour was black with a minimal brown head with spotty lacing. A few oil splotches across the top as well. Aromas of freshly ground coffee, bakers chocolate, brownies, hot fudge and some roasted nuttiness. Taste follows the nose with the iced coffee upfront and waves of dry, bitter chocolates following. The mouthfeel is thin and oily, but the flavors are very prominent. Finishes very nicely with a semi-dry chocolate coating the coffee. Not too bitter or sharp, very nice.","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"
490,"2014-03-22",3.9,"On tap at KBS release at Founders. Poured black with thinned tan cream head. Aroma of roasted semi sweet milk chocolate. Tingly carb thick bod. Smokey roast bitter choc banana taste. Balance and complex.","New York, New York, USA","charule"
490,"2014-03-19",4.3,"Nothing beats sitting in the freezing cold drinking hot cocoa... Except maybe sitting in the freezing cold drinking an amazing stout. Drinking an amazing stout that tastes like cocoa pushes the bar into unexplored territories of unexplored awesome. A lot of chocolate flavors here, you can definitely taste the fudge. Its isnt horribly over sweet either like other chocolate stout offerings. This is one of the good ones... One of the very good ones.","","malkyore"
490,"2014-03-19",4.4,"I had this on tap at the brewery. Its delicious. The aroma is of a strong coffee and chocolate. It has a very nice chocolate and fudge taste to it. Very good.","USA","Krej"
490,"2014-03-18",4.3,"Aroma is coffee, fudge, malt. Appearance is black, light brown head. Taste is great, good coffee and chocolate flavor. Mouthfeel is kind of flat, but thick. Overall, this wins except on the palate.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
