4230,"2017-03-26",3.7,"Bouteille partagée. Merci à Lucie et David! Deuxième Bellwoods que jai la chance de goûter. Déjà, même à travers la bouteille on peut voir que la couleur est flamboyante, un liquide rougeâtre séchappe du goulot avec beauté. Au nez, des arômes de cerises funky nous viennent aux narines. Au goût, lacidité vient chatouiller lintérieur des joues, les cerises sont à lhonneur, acide citrique, arrière-goût à peu près inexistant avec une finale très brève pâteuse de noyaux de cerise. Assez sèche en bouche.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","Frudel"

4230,"2016-01-25",3.9,"(500ml bottle @ the brewery, Jan 7 2016) Pours a lightly hazy pale pink with a tiny whitish ring of bubbles and lace. Aroma is lovely sour cherry, rose wine, tart green apple, a bit of pit fruit, a wet barnyard brett funk, oak with vanilla hints, a bright minerality. Palate is lighter than the nose, with some light tart cherry, pale pit fruit, citrus, a bit of apple. Tartness is quite light. Towards the finish, oak, dry earthy Brett, hay, dusty and a bit mineral. Finish is a little bit of cherry skin and pit, floral, lightly tannic and dry. A bit of cinnamon hearts in the aftertaste. Body is fairly light with quite soft carbonation. No gusher here. This really was quite a nice beer, perhaps my expectations and the drink-in pricing left me a bit let down. I felt the cherry presence in the mouth could be higher, but its elegant.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

Thank you to fellow Ratebeerian ""jercraigs"" for this fine brew. Yeah, shes a pretty lil pink number and the head pisses off straight away she does. A muscular nasal scoop fills my schnoz with barnyard funk, vanilla and sweet cherries. Lightly tart, the taste is funkier than expected but nicely balanced by bright cherries, vinous notes, white bread, oak and vanilla.

They BW bottleshop has been open for two hours and theyve already sold 700 bottles, only 300 left.) This beer pours like my daughters created it. Cloudy Pink with a ring and floaters of white head. (All its missing is the sparkly princess unicorn.) Nose is mouth-watering sour apples and no cherries, from my admittedly spotty sense of smell. The taste is ... awesome. Gentle vingerette sour of apples, barely there hay malts, cream, the thought of vanilla and a background of cherries. Nicely dry, not that I expected a Mega Brewery fruit mess. Very, very drinkable. Time to fake a poop-splosion at the office and head to BW. Itll be gone before the end of the work day, and its worth trying.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Helsdon"
