3681,"2016-10-29",4.0,"9.7%ABV. Old Fishermans Ale.

Poured out dark brown. 38ºSRM.

Nose is caramel, burnt sugar with some nice rum cake and christmas cake aromas.

Mouthfeel is watered honey or syrup. Palate has light treacle with a backbone of black bread, pie crusts, honeyed wheat toast, boiled barley. There is nice fruity dimension to the palate as well with plum preserves, honeyed dates, and currant jam. Nice bitters to balance all the starchy, fruity flavors with noble bitter, alcoholic heat. There are some nice woody flavors with aged oak, some very light spruce.

Finish is alcoholic, woody and Christmas-y.

For me overall, this was like a more hoppy version of the Pannepot Grand Reserva.

3681,"2016-07-30",4.0,"500ml bottle from Brothers Beer in Auckland. Dark mahogany brown color with a small tan head leaving a thick ring. Aroma is rich with tobacco, leather, fine mahog furniture, molasses, sugar plum, date, port. The flavor is quite complex, somewhat sweet, rich with overripe fruits and vinous notes, with a mildly bitter finish. Fuller bodied, slightly syrupy, clean though. Great complex beer.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
3681,"2016-06-04",4.0,"Hard to fault. Thick, full and resplendent. If any fault, gobbledegook on back of the label. But that overwhelmed by the dark lustre entombed. A repeater.","NEW ZEALAND","trentacle"

3681,"2016-01-29",3.9,"Red wine and bitter chocolate on the nose. Lots of different dark fruit on the palate with rum and raisin, coffee and more chocolate. Strong malt base but not overpowering - the alcohol is well hidden. Epically good.","OSHAWA, Ontario, CANADA","GlennHendry"
3681,"2016-01-23",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2016 Bottle 500ml: no. 7540. Served at room temperature. Pours a dark brown with a good sized, foamy, tanned head that slowly dissipates. Aroma has notes of smoky charred oak and caramel malts, sticky figs, sultanas, spiced dark rum, chocolate and hints of coffee. Flavour is a light earthy bitterness with plums, spiced fruit mince, chocolate, coffee and notes of peat and charcoal in the finish. Full bodied with soft carbonation, an oily texture and a long dry finish. Well hidden alcohol content. Tasty stuff.","Southern Highlands, AUSTRALIA","Night_Cap"
3681,"2015-12-05",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 18, 2016 [12/15] Bottle 8042. Superposition of Old Ale and Barleywine I guess. Ooh, someones been at the label with the quantum Bedazzler too. Clear dark reddish brown with a beige head that settles to half an inch or so and lasts well. Aroma of peated malt, singed toffee, vanilla, golden raisins, hazelnuts. Reminds me of Thornbridge Bracia as much as anything. Silky texture, lowish carbonation. Peated malt to the fore in the taste, some sweet dried fruit and nuts, fruit cake spices. The peat wasnt too much in the aroma but its a bit much and a bit medicinal (at first I thought plasticky) in the mouth. Dries out a bit with spices, firm bitterness and just a little overt alcohol. Good, may well improve. [3.9][6/16] Alas no. Thinned out a bit and the peat is still more prominent. Fine drop though.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
