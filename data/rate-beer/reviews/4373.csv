4373,"2015-09-25",4.5,"The beer is black with moderate nougat colored foam. It is a further development of the brewery Sustenance Black Beer, which was very popular in a very short time. The brewer got the idea to barrel age it 11 months in bourbon barrels and the result is a beautiful black beer that smells of oak, vanilla, bourbon and some smoke. The taste is weak bourbon with oak distinct flavor of fresh wood, a little acid and a little vanilla sweetness. Moreover schwarzbiers licorice flavor that is clear and long-lasting. It has a retracted hop bitterness that prolongs the aftertaste of licorice and vanilla in union.","Valby, DENMARK","TorbenJensen"

The look: Black body topped by a medium dark beige head with good retention of leaving lots of lacings on the glass.
In long: Nose is oaky and somewhat fruity bringing almost a red wine barrel sensation more than bourbon oak.  Taste is very toasted, a bit nutty, husky malt shells sensation, rather fruity (red and white grapes, berries of all kinds), mild bourbon notes, oak well integrated and very cohesive with all the flavor elements. A overall vinous sensation. Inexplicable alcohol bite .finish, is this really only 6.5% abv?  Plenty of oak tannins, astringent sharp finish with a fruity-vinous sourness.

The beer is dark brown, nearing black. The beige head stands in at a fingers width, and leaves some decent lacing on the glass.

The aroma is quite sweet. Booze, vanilla, malt, light roast, chocolate.

The flavor is definitely bourbon forward. Grandiose vanilla presence. The sweetness is formidable, and I can see that my six ounces will be sufficient. The bourbon, while overpowering to some degree, is bold and tasty. Chocolate and roast play a secondary role, and blend nicely with the the bourbon character. Mildly roasty, perhaps the other aspects of the beer overshadow the roast somewhat.

Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. Sweet and boozy.

An interesting beer. Not my favorite bourbon barrel aged brew by any stretch, but worth a try. I enjoyed this.

Pours a deep dark brown with the faintest of ruby highlights and a huge bubbly off white head that sticks around forever. Smells of lemony citrus, bourbon, vanilla, faint bit of bretty horsehair, and cocoa. Slightly sour on the nose, is that supposed to be there, or did some bugs hitch a ride from barrel to bottle? This would certainly explain the spirited carbonation. Taste is a bit sour with some chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla thrown in.

Pours pitch black and completely opaque without even the slightest hint of lighter color when held to a light source. Quite viscous looking with a half finger mocha colored head that quickly settles into a lasting ring. Sporadic spots of lacing left behind.

Intensely boozy aroma with a huge barrel presence. Lots of sweet boozy bourbon along with some earthy oak and faint vanilla. Underneath there is a slight smokey malt presence with hints of chocolate, toffee and roasted coffee bean but the nose of this beer is all about the bourbon.

Medium bodied and slightly viscous with a very prominent bourbon flavor. Again, as in the aroma, the barrel character dominates the flavor with a burst of hot, boozy bourbon that lingers throughout, slightly overpowering the other flavors. Slight earthy oak and faint vanilla/toasted coconut but the bourbon and hot alcohol overtake these notes pretty quickly. Underneath there is a roasted chocolate malt presence with hints of roasted coffee bean, toffee and oatmeal. Slightly smokey which provides some balance to the sweet bourbon but overall this beer is just a bit too much of a bourbon bomb for my liking.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

4373,"2010-02-20",3.2,"Sampled October 2009
A solid pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a three finger thick, lightly browned, tanned colored head.  The beer is quite black in color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich ruby hue when held up to the light.  The aroma is definitely spiced with an ample signature of Bourbon, though it is not overwhelming; notes of toasted coconut, vanillin, spicy oak, and a touch of heat from the Bourbon.  I cant really notice much of the base beer underneath the Bourbon though; perhaps a touch of toasted malt.

The beer tastes fairly dry with a touch of tartness from the oak and Bourbon.  Notes of vanillin, some coconut and a bit of spicy Bourbon in the finish are noticeable, but dont play nearly as big a role as they did in the aroma.  There is a touch of toasted malt noticeable in the finish as well as hint of roasted malt that tastes a bit like black coffee.  A touch of Bourbon heat is brought out by the oak more so than actual alcohol.  This feels quite light bodied on the palate, but that isnt unexpected as this isnt the world strongest Bourbon aged beer; the carbonation adds a prickly texture that tends to make this beer seem a bit thin at first, but releasing the extra carbonation produces a creamy texture despite the light body.

This is a fairly one-dimensional beer with the Bourbon being quite dominant.  If you can appreciate that sort of thing then you will likely enjoy this beer as it is done pretty well here.  This does have a nice vanillin and coconut character to it, though it is a bit hot and spicy from the Bourboned alcohol at times.  I could definitely wish for more dark malt character to come through, but this more than a serviceable brew for this chilly Arizona weekenend.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

As her warm nectar kisses your lips, you too will be a born again believer. Shorts Brewing is a little old brewpub located in Bellaire, Michigan and they have been offering up some fantastically innovative beers. While all have been tasty, some have been out-of-this-world fantastic. Their Smores Stout comes to mind, and seeing as I am gazing fondly at my glass filled with their Bourbon Barrel Soaked Sustenance Black Beer, my hopes are reasonably high.


Very deep clear brown-black with little head, a khaki necklace, and a scattering of large bubbles decorating her surface. Being a growler of fresh brew, I wasnt expecting a voluminous head; tis the nature of the game, but neither is she flat and oxidized. No need to dilly-dally as her nose reaches out with drunken authority and smacks me right upside the head before piercing my heart with bourbon soaked dark fruits: raisins, plums, figs, and dates. Licorice root meets bourbon-stewed black cherries, pits included, while wood lingers in the background with a hint of warm brown spices. Burnt molasses and caramel? Mm tasty. Licking lips already damp with anticipation, we meet in a dry, slightly burnt sweet kiss as cinnamon and nutmeg dry the front of my palate. Wheres my bourbon? Oh! There she is. Bourbon comes rushing in for a long finish rich with steeped dark fruits, burnt sugars, particularly molasses and caramel, charred wood, licorice root, and a hit of chili spice for added warmth. Toasty and tasty, my chest immediately picks up a joyous glow. My breath is peppered in chili powder, charred wood, and bourbon nectars. Overall, her body is of a pleasantly balanced medium weight, making for a dangerously easy quaffing session as my empty glass testifies.


The Shorts Bourbon Barrel Soaked Sustenance Black Beer was mighty tasty and well-balanced. The bourbon shone through with deep riches which for some may be a turnoff, but I am an unabashedly unashamed bourbon freak. The more bourbon the better, in cases such as these. I am also pleased to say though that her character as a Black Beer was not overshadowed; in fact, the two worked together in almost flawless perfection. Where one started and one stopped, I could not tell, making for a seamless marriage of palates.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

The aroma is completely out of left field....I can not believe how much it reminds me of a Jolly Pumpkin beer.  A dark cocoa malt base shows formidable notes of soured, funky oak, vanilla, moderate spices, and dry brett.  Sour mash Kentucky bourbon shows subtly on the nose.  The flavor profile is even more sour and bretty than the aroma indicates.  The funky, old, vanilla laden oak gives just the right amount of bourbon heat, while lactose serves as a bridge to the bittersweet, dark cocoa maltiness.  Substantial in both body and carbonation, the brett imparts its signature dry, parching mouthfeel, sourness intensifying on the finish.  This is a great beer.

Recieved this in an ongoing trade with hoppymeal, thanks again Derek! Sustenance pours black with deep chestnut highlights when backlit. A creamy two fingers worth of mocha head rose on the pour and as it slowly fell left thick sheet lacing down the glass. Each drink leaves great, thick drink lines behind. The head eventually settles to a half finger cap atop the black body. 

The first thing that hits my nose is the effects of the barrel ""soaking"" as the bottle implies. Damp oak, bourbon, and vanilla come forward in that order of intensity and although the barrel aging is most prominent it’s soft and allows the schwarz to come through nicely. Each swirl of the glass brings along a solid roastiness and espresso. A mouthwatering beer the second I bury my nose in the glass.

Flavor keeps in stride with the aroma. Roastiness and coffee grounds upfront lay the foundation for the barrel aging. The maltiness is present throughout the drink allowing the bourbon to be a complimenting, as opposed to dominating, characteristic. The damp oak falls back compared to the aroma. The bourbon is brought to the front, followed closely by vanilla, and last but certainly not least is the damp oakiness. The bourbon finishes things off with a nice heat and hit of booziness. This is a super high quality schwarz from Short’s.

One of the reasons I love schwarz biers is the body. This follows stride with some of the best but adds a bit of creaminess from the barrel aging. Medium body that leaves a slickness on the tongue.

For a barrel aged beer this is highly drinkable. The lighter body and a manageable abv keep this flowing without a problem. As a matter of fact I’m drinking this glass way too fast. I can’t slow down.

I thought this would be a good beer, just as all Short’s beers are, but I didn’t expect to be drinking something so good. This is a phenomenal beer. So many barrel aged beers are over the top in whatever liquid the barrel previously held but Short’s hit it on the head here. Another great beer from a brewery that’s becoming one of my favorites with every passing beer I drink.

4373,"2008-09-02",3.3,"Chocolate-cola pour with mocha foam.  Green apple, minty herbs, dark chocolate, graham cracker crusts in the aroma; hugely tangy and almost tart with the swift buttery sweetness of bourbon; too much presence really.  A touch of cuban mocha sits sweetly with a fitting, darkening character that distantly balances the almost unbearable tang of the bourbon; additionally, some dark spicing of anise and  sweet tobacco forms a semblance of malt build, but the the confronting tart sweetness of the bourbon is simply too ostentatious.

The flavor is much the same; lots of dusty sweetness and almost-sour apple-like tang; full of white fruit and sparkling effervescence that seems quite out of place in this style built on munich and caramel malts and their characters, none of which are even difficultly visible, although there is a steadfast and somewhat cloying sheen of vanilla throughout.  The fruit character of its sweetness has some vinousness to it, but its sharp-edged and brittle; not raisins, plums, and dates but pears, apples, and pineapple, consistently.  Notes of a delicate bourbon, really.  And its so immersed in that fruity, tart texture that it almost seemed like an acetaldahyde-crushed beer at first, and I still cant definitely tell that it isnt.

Light-medium palate pushes the tartness through.  Lightly effervescent.  The finish really expands the borders of the flavor quite nicely, and tends to accentuate the bitter chocolate and pistachio bits of the malts; still tart, but its interesting enough at the end to seem inviting and redeemable as a whole experience.  Still I’d really love less bourbon mucking up my perception of this thing.  Thanks Derek!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
4373,"2008-08-25",4.0,"22oz bomber. Pours deep, deep mahogany with a bubbly two-finger tan head that lingers for a little while and leaves a trace of lacing.

Smell is complex and interesting with bourbon definitely showing up and burning the nose a little.  There is also tons of dark fruit with raisins and even grapes on top a very sweet malt base with brown sugar as well.

Taste is just as interesting as the nose with an initial sweetness of sugar and caramel.  Dark fruits show throughout on top of a roasted malt base before giving way to a tingling alcohol finish.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation and leaves a sticky sweet aftertaste tinged with booze.

Pours a cola-like dark brown with a 1/2 inch head that quickly recedes to the very outer edges.

Smells of bourbon, berries and molasses. Actually, a very tasty smelling beer.

Similar flavors to the smell with some odd similarities to cola. Not that this is necessarily bad, but it is interesting that it ended up this way. Definitely a fair amount of bourbon here, but the flavors work, so I don’t mind. Coffee and some more dark fruits also present themselves.

Medium to low carbonation helps this beer from being too thin. Mind you, this is only 6.5%, so don’t expect a huge body. Surprisingly, the bourbon doesn’t really thin out this beer at all - I would guess this beer, without the bourbon aging, would have no more body than this, and quite possibly less. All of this helps to make this a very drinkable bourbon barrel aged beer. Slight alcohol hit at the end - in a nice, warming way.

4373,"2008-06-21",3.8,"From a 22oz Bottle.  Courtesy of CharlesDarwin.  Mostly transparent, dark rootbeer brown colored pour with a finger of fizzy, light tan head.  Aromas of bourbon are clearly present, but not overpowering, bringing forth notes of caramel, rye seed, vanilla and a warming booziness.  An underlying chocolate maltiness lies beneath, but its not really distinguishable as a schwarzbier.  Medium bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel with a relatively thin, light texture.  Flavors of light chocolate and caramel malt up front on the palate with a hint of roast.  The bourbon flavors develop mid-palate, and have a distinct, rye-like character hidden in there with the oaky vanilla.  Finishes with a lager-like cleanness and quickness before shades of bourbon booziness makes its way back to linger in my breath.  Enjoyable beer overall, especially in the relatively high drinkability with bourbon complexity.

4373,"2008-05-10",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 11, 2008 22oz Bottle. Rich creamy fresh bourbon nose, with softness, cream and brown sugar. Pours a black-brown, with tan fringe. Deep. Nice light sweetness, bits of vanilla, oak, and candied caramel. Great bourbon flavor over a salty, well-malted beer. Body is balanced, creamy and deep. Nice, 
subtle barrel use. Fruitiness. Figs and jam. Great roastiness. Delicious. The barrel and base beer meld very well together, which is surprising considering how light the base beer is compared to most barrel base beers. Its fresh and well done, all around. Excellent! Thanks Sean!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

4373,"2008-05-09",3.9,"Courtesy of kmweaver. Dark brown/black body with a medium-sized tan head. The aroma is buttery, coconut bourbon, chocolate and roast. The flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter with lots of buttery bourbon, chocolate, molasses, marshmallow and toffee. Medium/full body is very soft with light carbonation. Quite good. However, ken still sucks.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"
4373,"2008-05-09",4.0,"22oz bottle, courtesy of hoppymeal.  Thanks, Derek!  Pours a dark, reddish-cola color; light tan head with patchy, fine-bubbled lacing.  Very nice, blended bourbon  presence in the aroma; toasty oak, milk chocolate, and caramel; generous, toasty barrel presence in the aroma; soft, chewy nose.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: lightly carbonated; soft, toasty bourbon character showing vanilla and minimal alcohol, if any; dark chocolate, caramel, nougat, and soft, toasty vanilla; velvety mouthfeel, toasty wood and oakiness; just a carefully blended, toasty and generous beer; very drinkable.  Lengthy finish, showing cocoa, dark chocolate, and toasty oak and vanilla; barrel presence is beautifully integrated.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
