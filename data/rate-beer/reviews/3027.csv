Strong bouquet of candied peaches, cognac, vanilla, lovely wood tannins, sweet white grapes, roses, honey liqueur. Sweet, fruity onset, melon, candied orange, pineapple, soft carbo, honeyish sweetness stretching out over a rounded, mellow caramelly malt sweet middle, eventually very vinous mouthfeel, full, with a woody finish including retronasal vanilla oak, a dash of spicy hops, lingering residual sugary sweetness but most of all, a lot of calvados-like, expressive alcohol, heating the back of the mouth - perhaps a bit too sharply so, but still not wry or unpleasant in terms of flavor. I can see this improve a lot with age as the alcohol mellows a bit; in this young form a bit too boozy for my taste, but as a whole this is clearly a fantastic sipper, which Id be more than happy to revisit.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

The aroma is nicely balanced between the oak and the characteristics it imparts and the malt and its aroma. The oak balances nicely with the malt and adds a touch of a tobacco character and some light tobacco. The malt is rich and full of caramel, light chocolate, light roast and toast. Some light dark fruit notes - raisins, plum and cherries. 
Pours brown with some ruby highlights. Moderately thick, light tan head that recedes fairly quickly to the edges. 
Flavor starts sweet with lots of caramel and toffee, moderate toast, light chocolate and roast. Mid palate you get the dries fruit - raisins, prunes and cherries. The fruit welcomes in the barrel notes - oak and a hint of tobacco. The finish is a balance of oak and caramel which works really nicely. The bitterness is moderate and helps balance the sweetness. Light alcohol spice in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Astringency is faint and the alcohol warmth is medium low. 
Overall a great beer. The new oak works really well to balance the sweet caramel and toffee notes an doesn't dominate the flavors. This is fairly easy drinking at 10%.

Poured into a snifter. Color is a deep reddish-amber with a nice off-white head that settles down somewhat quickly. The nose is really nice and complex with oak, vanilla, dark fruits, figs, caramel, and some sweet malt.

The taste mixes the oak with the base quite well bringing out a bit of sweetness and fruit. Mouthfeel is really nice and rich, bringing out all the flavors that this has going on. Drinks quite well and is a really nice brew.

It pours beautifully, a beautiful orange/red color with a foamy white ehad that recedes to some gorgeuos lacing.

It is straight up fucking infected though, maybe a stray batch of Fred Flanders form the wood got bottled. It smells like a sour Belgian pale. It has a bretty presence and some sweetness.

The flavor is sweet and sour with a definite oak flavor. Well ill be fucked, it isnt half bad infected. It has a big lemony flavor, some cloying sweetness from the base barleywine. Some solid barleywine base flavors like caramel and toffee are very pronounced. The wood is big and bold and it has a bit of spiciness. 

Ever had a sour Belgo-barleywine? This is it. I wish I could have it un-infected. And sadly because it is infected I have to dock points somewhere and I will go with the smell.

smell is oak, vanilla, some banana-like fruit, dried fruits, and a bit of peppermint.

taste is a nice caramel sweetness that gets dried out just enough from the wood not to be cloying. a great mix of oak barrel and sweet maltiness/dried fruit, spicy tobacco notes, vanilla, a touch of old warn out hops that are only leaving a shell of bitterness to backup the brew.

nice moderate mouthfeel, maybe a hint of syrupiness. definately easy to drink. delicious beer. I think more breweries need to use clean oak in their barleywines and stouts as you get more spiciness from the wood and a dryness without adding the burn or external booze flavors.

3027,"2011-01-13",4.5,"12 oz bottle (from a trade, iirc) from 06/06 consumed here in January 2011 to celebrate a good news.  Has a slightly unlevel cap, Ive never seen a bottle like this.  Very low carbonation, but it did hold.  Nose is huge, intense, complex, and room-filling; tobacco, plum, caramel, oak, vanilla, cherry, red berry, light chocolate, smoke, and some lighter aging-effects (sherry, Madeira).  Super rich malt, but doesnt seem to cloy.  Opaque mahogany with faint ruby hues, supports a short but lacing and clingy film of a beige head.  Taste is alcoholic, thin-bodied, not all that sweet, has woodsy and vanillin oak, tobacco and faint tar, but really comes through with a forward leather quality, I can just imagine it bending and making noise.  Faint mint and tea leaves under the tobacco, sweet grape and end-product wine, low-to-medium bitterness.  Caramel morphing into toffee, with cherry and rising citrus (and sweetness) and strengthening resin.  Just a touch of grass clippings - its surprising that this much hop presence remains, and that it only started to come to the fore after a few ounces.  Very slight hint of tart.  Aftertaste is in the gummy caramel category but has mellifluous honey around the edges.  Mouthfeel is, again, thin, but smooth without dragging, luscious without preening.  Alcohol is very well-integrated (Ive had seven-percenters that were more obvious) and Id bet that time has siphoned off some of the syrupy feel that plagues this kind of beer at a young age.  I love rating (and above all, tasting) Alans beers because of their depth - this is developing into a small encyclopedia of flavor terminology, and most impressively, the components work well together without jarring.  Stunning, a clear masterpiece.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
3027,"2011-01-11",3.2,"Poured into a snifter.  2009 vintage.

3.5  A:  Murky light brown color.  About one finger of creamy beige head that falls rather quickly and leaves a small incomplete ring of lacing. 

3.5  S:  Holy shit is this woody!  This is simply dripping with the essence of oak.  Really, the oak is so strong that it covers up a lot of the other aromas, but Ill try to pick them out anyway.  Sweet caramel and toffee, boozy, apricot and pear brandy, plum and raisin, vanilla, and tobacco.  You really have to like wood to like the way this smells, I think theres just a little too much.

3.5 T:  Again, strong oak, tobacco, pear brandy, plum and raisin, and tobacco.  Vanilla from the oak, toasted malts, nuts, and bread.  This is really boozy for 10%.  If I had to guess without already knowing, I would have thought this was at least 15%.  Strangely, this has the essence of a bourbon barrel without the bourbon, but not just the oak if that makes any sense (I doubt it does).  This is absolutely packed with flavor, but it seems raw even with over a year of age on it.  

4.0 M:  Heavy body.  Good moderate carbonation.  Reasonably creamy, but a bit chewier than I prefer.

3.5  D:  This has the makings of a fantastic beer, but I think it needs a good three years to get to that level.  Even though this bottle had over a year on it, the taste was too earthy and raw.  I love oak, but I found it to be a bit too aggressive.  Also, the alcohol is way too apparent right now.  Its quite boozy for only 10%.  Great beer, just not yet.","Pennsylvania, USA","DavoleBomb"

How: Bottle 12oz.  A few times.  This rating for a 2008 vintage consumed when about 2 years of age.
The look: Partially cloudy dark golden body topped by a persistent small off-white head
In long: Nose has quite a bit of oak barrel, vanilla, fruits.  Taste is rich and complex.  Plenty of caramel, plenty of cedar, bread crust, booze, strange oaky sourness.  Very sweet but with such a rich decadent body Im ok with it.  The beer is a little too boozy for me, if anything I would have guessed more than the actual 10%.  I have tried fresher vintages and older vintages of Fred From The Wood but I always found the regular Fred a superior beer.  I dont understand why Fred From The Wood is rated higher than regular Fred.  Maybe because of rarity or maybe because beer geeks really have an unconditional love for booze and barrel flavors.  
Im now on a mission to make people realize that barrel aging a perfectly good beer does not improve it.  Ive tried to yell it in a megaphone nobody cares.  However I have noticed that people will believe what you quietly whisper in their ears.  Ive got a lot of work ahead of me.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
3027,"2010-06-21",4.4,"Rapture.  In. A. Glass.  This beer has everything.  It crosses so many delicious borders all at once.  It has such a sweet note to it, very sugary -like a tripel or a belgian strong -but not candy sweet.  It is still backed by a little bit of bite to it, bitterness and alcohol like a barley wine.  But is so mellow -and the wood flavor comes out right at the end, just ...just fantastic.  Back to it tho-  This has a slightly smokey, ginger, raisin brown sugar and molasses scent.  Flavor is like overly ripe banana in its sweetness and softness, but cuts with some bitterness and the alcohol.  This is fantastic stuff.

A light tobacco, herbal spice, toast, resin, and just a hint of alcohol. Flavor is still a bit hot and seems to lose some of the complexity, but remains very nice.

Appearance : Nice amber color with no head.

Aroma : Big fruity dry apricots. Syrupy with hints of tobacco leaves. Hints of alcohol. Feels a bit sour, probably from the oak. Very rich

Taste : Taste also rich and oaky. Very sweet and fruity and a bit sour. Warm and sweet finish. Gets more oaky at the end.

Overall :  This is very well made. Its my second HOTD brew (the first being Adam) and I think this is not really my thing. I can easily see the quality in this but it doesnt hit the sweetspot for me. Maybe its because of the oak sourness.

Its been a while since Ive had a Fred unfortunately, so I cant really compare them to each other which would be nice.

A - Deep hazy copper with a finger of tan head. Head dissipates quickly with no lacing, but leaves an oily film almost.

S - Barrel aging is apparent in the nose. Oak, malts, spice, vanilla, molasses, decent citrus hops, and a tinge of alcohol.

T - Im really enjoying the amount of hops in this fresh bottle, and the alcohol doesnt come through much at all compared to the nose. More malts and oak finish it out.

M/D - Medium to full body with a little too much carbonation for me. Drinkability is great since I love hoppy barleywines and barrel aging!

3027,"2010-01-03",3.9,"Are you a dog lover? Yeah, me too. In fact, I especially love my dogs when they are just about at cellar temperature and demanding my immediate quaffing attentions. Oh, wait. Are we talking about two different kinds of dogs? Im talking about the bottled kind. You know, the ones from Hair of the Dog Brewery out of Portland, Oregon. Probably their most famous pooch is the Hair of the Dog Fred which, on his own is one fabulous standard Barleywine, but add a little bit of wood, a sprinkle of bottle-conditioning, and you suddenly have a rare breed on your hands. If you must give him a name, as all good dogs need a good name, I would call mine the Hair of the Dog Fred From the Wood. Dont like it? Tough; I think its got a nice ring to it.


Dirty orange and desperately in need of a bath, he has a splattering of bubbly froth which splashes against the sides of my glass with nary a rhyme nor a reason. Its quite the sticky stuff too, lingering from first quaff to last. A big whiff of his nose finishes with a prominent hit of alcohol in the back. Not enough to burn any nose hairs, but certainly enough to gather my full attentions. Oranges steeped in booze then stewed slowly over a low heat permeates his nose while in the background mingle faint notes of baled hay, sprouted grains, and sweet orange marmalade spread over toasted bread. This is definitely going to be one bruiser of a dog, or at least, thats how he appears at the moment. My first sip is sweeter than I anticipated with homemade marmalade taking center stage. I take a generous dab and spread it over golden toasted bread while cinnamon sugar with a touch of nutmeg awaits their fair sprinkling. While I bite into that, boozy fruits rush my senses and latch firmly onto my palate. While her first impressions are sweet, toasty, and a bit spiced, her middle and finish are all about the finest oranges steeped and stewed in booze. There is no burn, just pleasantly permeating warmth with a nice addition of fresh peaches to the stewed oranges. Dry spices and warmth linger long in my breath as my mouth thirsts for more. Sawdust flitters in and out of the background; just enough wood to remind me of where Fred has been lately. Hair of the Dog Fred From the Wood was exquisitely un-complex which made for all that more of an enjoyable quaffing session.


I spent a long time with this beer, not so much to try and find more aromas and flavors than were actually there, but because it was most heavy, most warm, and most satisfying.

Hazy orange/amber color with a stylish ivory-colored big and hard head that slowly settles into some chunky lacings. A really good looking beer.

Lots and lots of wonderful aromas of fresh/new oak barrels, very clean and well defined. Plenty of vanilla, Some notes of grassy and spicy hops. Candy. Perhaps a hint of fruit. A hint of alcohol.

A wonderful taste of fresh/new oak-barrels with big notes of vanilla. A tasty semi-sweet malty backbone beneath the oak character. The taste is quite sweet actually. Candy. Honey? Light hop aromas in the mouth. The finish is pleasant with a nice bitterness to it, some alcohol and mild phenols, and some spicy hops.

Medium body with a very smooth texture.

I really liked this one. A very refined and sophisticated character, yet with plenty of edginess to make things interesting. The aromas of fresh oak barrels in this one are amazing.

Pours clear dark red with a great, creamy, off-white head. Aroma has cellar, prunes, red apples, oak, vinious, peach, caramel and lightly roasted. Low carbonation, wonderful oily mouthfeel. Really impressive. Flavour is initially quite sweet, lots of toasted caramel, light roasted, some tobacco, prunes, vanilla, oak, light tartness.

3027,"2009-10-08",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2010 2009 batch. 12oz bottle thanks to Sparky27 for hooking me up with this one. Pours dark orange with golden edges and small off-white head. Aroma is oak, vanilla, caramel, citrus and some booze. Flavor is oak, vanilla, citrus, grapes, caramel, sweet malt, and light hops. Finishes sweet with very light alcohol burn. Really great mouthfeel and perfect carbonation for a BA barley wine. I liked regular Fred quite a bit, but this version is much better. The oak barrels really add a nice complexity. It doesnt  have some of the cloying sweetness regular Fred has. This is a really good beer. Cheers HOTD.
Re-rate: Was able to get my hands on a couple of bottles of the original batch from rooftoprogue. Has held up unbelievably well. Aroma is unbelievable.

Smooth body; in fact its not smooth, its slimy. That could be the yeast. Vanilla and buttery malt loaf in the mouth - did I mention diacetyl? Huge hoppy bite, but within acceptable limits. Pretty OK, but the slimy palate it too much. Sticks my lips together with sugars. The sugars dont cover the alcohol either - this smelt and tasted as if it was well over 10%.

3027,"2009-06-11",3.9,"2008 vintage.
Appearance  Pours a glowing golden color with a tiny quarter finger head that disappears quickly and leaves a tiny ring clinging on for dear life around the edge of the glass. When held up to the glass this is a slightly hazy golden orange hue. 

Smell  Hints of Belgian yeast, oak, and pale malts. There is a fruitiness to it that I cant put my finger on.

Taste  Slight tinge of hops surrounded by a blast of oaky, fruity malts. Some grapes and cherries dance together and meld well. Some raisins are also doing their thing in there. This is too damn complex for me to get everything.

Mouthfeel  There is a slight tingle from the low carbonation, perfect for this beer. This feels very syrupy without being too thick. Coats the mouth well and sticks around to let you indulge in the complex flavor profiles. 

Drinkability  Awesome beer, a definite sipper though. This is one of those beers you really only want to drink one of because it is so damn complex and rich in flavor.","Salem, Oregon, USA","josephselander"

Then the wood kicks in. The wood lingers as the hop flavors come and go.  First pine hops, then citrus.  Nice sticky mouthfeel.

3027,"2009-05-08",4.0,"Big thanks to vwcraig for sending this 2007 my way as part of a recent trade. I have had Fred and liked it a lot so I am anticipating fftw. This beer was a tad darker than Fred but still sorta golden until the last dregs went in which turned it a ruby, cloudy color. The smell is like whiskey or bourbon, strong alcohol, wow! I dont drink whiskey or bourbon but I love the smell of this beer. Surely this was not aged in plain oak barrels, if it was, huzzah. Wow, the taste is woody! Woody and also slightly bitter hoppiness at the end. This does not taste like the Fred I had last year at all. This is very good but is a slow sipper due to the strength of the flavor. Im sure this stuff is also pretty potent as far as ABV goes. Very nice beer but I should have shared it with a friend :( .

Finally getting off my ass and reviewing some beers instead of writing notes for another rainy day.  Pours a very ruddy brown with a heavy level of carbonation and a decent single-finger head that settles slowly with good lacing.  Aroma is a beautiful meld of a fruity, candy sweetness and a bold oak note, with the sweetness winning the battle...very engaging!  Flavor is, well, damn near amazing...glad I popped this one out of my newly organized cellar to get back to rating!  Heavy on roasty, caramel malts, dark fruit (raisiny), brown sugar, oak/tannins, vanilla, a slight note of tobacco, with a heavy, but enjoyable dose of booze at the end.  Finishes with a combination of very sweet, sugary malt and a slight hop bitterness...very unique in the finish.  Palate is a definite five...lively carbonation yet silky smooth...this is one of those rare beers I didnt even need to think about what to rate the palate.  Have I really been away from beer this long to where Im hyping this more than I should?  I dont think so...this is one fine beer and well deserving of the high ratings.

Aroma of a woodshop (fresh pine!) and vague sour/fruity notes (pear in particular).  Flavor is quite woody with a nice sour/sweet background.

3027,"2008-10-28",4.2,"12oz bottle.  Batch 64, ratebeer version.  Pours a muddy, emphatically unclear light orange color with a nice fat, thick white head with surprisingly good retention.  Nice lacing as well.  Aroma is the familiar Fred aroma, thankfully not buried or mutated by the barrel.  Vanilla, sweet grains, malt, something else I cannot put my finger on that is present in the regular Fred.  I’m a big fan of the regular Fred and I’ve had it several times.  Sometimes it’s like a normal BW and sometimes it’s magical.  I think older samples have been better and the time in the barrel and the two plus years since bottling have helped this one.  Back to topic. Red and dark fruits abound as this warms.  Intensely fruity almost.  Plum, apricot, brown sugar, slight citric fruits as well, honey.  The oak is subdued providing only a soft and nice vanilla component, no harshness is detected. Just a hint of alcohol sneaks through though it is not distracting or obvious.

Taste is very rich, extremely thick, sweet to the max without pushing cloying.  Thankfully this is mellowed to the point where the sweetness and thickness is not distracting.  All the apricot, honey, caramel goodness that was present in the nose comes through quite clear and well in the palate as well.   This is just really good, I don’t know what else to say.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

I think it could actually benefit from another year or so in the cellar.

Hazy medium orange with a creamy 1/2 finger yellowish white head, fading to a thick ring and and film.  I can definitely smell the regular Fred in here, but it doesnt seem near as sweet thanks to the addition of the dry oak notes.  In fact, this smells pretty darn nice.  Fruity nose of tangerines and grapefruit rinds, spicy and earthy hops, and a moderate amount of sweet honey and caramel malts.  Flavor again has plenty of clean oak notes--Im happy they didnt age this in bourbon--and it does so much to balance the sweetness of the regular Fred.  Some lightly sweet and tart raisins are also present amidst the myriad of other flavors.  Semi-dry finish with bitterness surprisingly peaking around a 3-4.  Alcohol masked very well, but it is noticeable.  However, once at room temp the nose gets pretty alcoholic.  Full body with light smooth carbonation.  Excellent beer.

3027,"2008-10-19",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2009 What a great beer.  There is so much going on with this one that I bet I could drink one every day for a month and not quite get it all. Pours a deep amber, with a pencil thin head. Aroma is pineapple and cigars, with some peppercorn thrown in. Flavor expands on the aroma, light fruit, some citrus, spice, carmel, malt, vanilla, wood, and clove. Slight booziness that adds complexity and never takes away from the taste. The fruits come in and out, sometimes coming to the forefront, and sometimes staying in the background. The addition of vanilla from the oak is welcome, although I do miss some of the yeasty characteristics found in a lot of barleywines. Hits just the right notes of hops and clove, adds both a smokey quality and a piney hoppiness. This one is flat out fantastic, I loved it. I bet this one ages like a dream!","Indiana, USA","StFun"

3027,"2008-10-12",3.5,"Pours a hazy golden amber with a small bubbly white head that dissipates very quickly to a ring and leaves traces of lacing.

The aroma is extremely unique for a barleywine.  It’s very sweet with light fruits and the caramel malts.  This is balanced by the significant boozy oak aroma which also lends a vanilla sweetness in the end.  Very different aroma...like white wine.

The taste has a hit of the vanilla sweetness from the oak up front before being giving way to the big caramel malt backbone.  There is a big alcohol burn in the finish balanced with a citrus hop bitterness.  As others have mentioned, I’d compare much of the characteristics of the taste to white wine...interesting.

Mouthfeel is creamy with soft carbonation that just coats the mouth in the woody sweetness.

This is a very interesting brew and one that I’m enjoying slowly.  I’m very interested to see what one of these tastes like in a couple years.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Taste is lots of sweetness in the same vein as the aromatic profile, some citrus and bittering hops in both the initial taste and in the finish,  and oak.
Finishes very crisp and dry for the style due to the oak and the bittering hops, yet still creamy and dense, yet quietly aggressive in the mouthfeel due to the oiliness and assertiveness of the hops, not to mention the malt structuring.

The flavor is very nice; initially I am struck by the agressive amount of bitter hops, the oak and wood flavors come in soon followed by a ton of sweet candied fruits. Some rich prune, plum and strawberry flavors. The flavor is well rounded by the barrel, almost a bit of bourbon in there. Some spices, especially orange peel also. Very good example of the style.

Nose is a freshly cut oak aroma and besides that smell, is hard for me to define other than that. Texture is very fine with a creamy smooth palate as the carbonation is very subdued.

Pours hazy, dark copper, with a massive four-inch head. The beige, dense foam floated like whipped egg whites for a lengthy time before the first sips broke up the mass.
A plethora of clingy rings and ripped sheets of lacework continued on. A real beaut.

Aromatics lead off with booze-soaked oak, cotton candy, tangerine zest, and malt bubblegum.
Sugared grapefruit, fresh vanilla, and caramel-drizzeled spruce resin follow through.

Medium bodied, but a bit chewy and plenty tacky. The carbonation level is high enough to create quite a lively feel, and makes the mouthfeel seem bigger than it really is.

Tropical fruit, sweet malt, and a zesty spiciness start the pallet. Candied fruit segments, oaky alcohol, and blossom honey come forward, as well as juicy hop resins and a firm bitterness.

Finishes with bourbony oak, lingering honey and citrus fruit, and a peppery warmth on the throat.

Wowza, what a great beer. The residuals get a bit tiring, but this ones tasting super fresh. As with the regular Fred, I believe the fresher the better. Aging may dry it up a bit, but youll be missing out on the oak and fresh hops.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"

3027,"2008-05-30",4.5,"Hard to control myself after tasting this wonderful beer. I had taken it to a party for my neices graduation party and the theme for the beers I had selected was barrel aged. This was a fantastic example of a barrel aged barleywine. The aroma is inviting, sweet malts, slightly boozy, with a nice dose of wood, fruits, hops, and brown sugar. The color looks like something youd find pouring out of an old rusty radiator. The flavor in this beer just melds so nicely together. Sweet malts, citrusy hops, vanilla, oak, alcohol, brown sugar, tobacco and slightly floral. Highly recommended and well worth its good name.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

The nose opened with warm toasted oak and medium-skinned fruits backed closely by spicy floral notes riding over toffee sweetness.. peppery alcohol and more oak on the back.  The flavor found more sour oak and fruity notes than Id like, masking the underlying goodness.. vanilla, caramel, and toffee join white pepper and clovey spicage deep down.. mild floral notes and warm peppery alcohol pair with sour oak through the finish.. this was tasty and intriguing, but I have to say I prefer the regular Fred.  Heavily carbonated and creamy on the palate with building warmth and sour oak impression as it moved through the mouth.. a bit too much oak going on, but all in all a very fine brew.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

4/02/2008:  Fred from the Wood pours a cloudy deep golden orange coor with a frothy off-white head.  The A aweet, rich, and malty aroma is accompanied by traces of sweet fruits and vanilla.  Sweet caramelized malt, vanilla, oak, fruit (caramelized pineapple, aged dried sweet orange citrus, peach), some muted tobacco (just a slight smoky woodiness), and hints of floral hops blend together for form a really complex and delicious flavor.  The finish is slightly dry with some spiciness, muted hops, and a lingering dried apricot flavor.  Overall this beer is very well-balanced and complex.  There is absolutely no alcohol flavor or burn.  It has a medium-full body that is quite smooth, mellow, and even somewhat creamy.  This is another excellent and expertly crafted brew from Hair of the Dog.  In comparison to the regular <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/hair-of-the-dog- Fred from the Wood has a slightly richer maltiness, but is a bit more dry.  It also has a really nice strand of vanilla in the aroma and flavor and the hop presence is definitely more muted and subdued (okay with my for this beer and style!).  This is an impressive beer that is simply delicious!

It has a good body structure, with an excellent mix of flavors: malt, caramel, toffee, vanilla, wood they are all balanced; sweet as it should be, but still with a powerful and good hopping, leading to a long final where the bitterness (maybe stronger than in the regular Fred) is complemented by a good caramel flavor, a touch of vanilla and some alcohol warmth.

3027,"2008-01-17",3.8,"Thanks to BuckeyeBoy for this great beer.  Bourbon whiskey up front, stepping aside for a second to allow caramel and toffee from the malt and a little floral hoppiness as well and a cherry and strawberry fruit to come in.  Then the bourbon slides back in front, covering it all up and transitioning into an alcoholic finish.  A slight vinious, tart grape flavor comes in the front as well.  Bitterness is clearly hiding in some crevices, but only the suggestion of it can be felt, as the alcohol and sweetness seem to cover most of it up.  Some vanilla notes from the oak are in there too, but also hard to find.  Palate is dense, smooth and rich.  This is a great, complex beer, covered up with a lot of booze. I think just the slightest hint of bourbon would have added something, but right now it takes away by covering up a lot of the other flavors.  Many do show up briefly, but I think it would be better off with less bourbon flavor.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"
3027,"2008-01-14",3.3,"So, I want to like this beer a lot because of my love for the regular version but I just cant.  From slob, a great trader, Ratebeer Edition, batch 64 , about 19 months old.  I had sips here and there when this came out the regular RB meet ups and it seemed good at the time but not so much now.  It does pour that beautiful dark dark murky golden color with a small head.  However, the aroma not so good.  I could put a positive spin on it and say its like pineapple and crème brûlée but I dont want to lie to myself.  Its prickly, spoiled tropical fruits, and an off putting, diacetyl-like aroma. Actually burns the inside of my nose.  Taste is not much better, some vanilla from the barrel I guess, again a weird sweetness with a strong burn in the throat.  A thick syrupy mouthfeel with reduced carbonation.

Thanks to whomever sent this in a trade quite a while ago.  Ive been wanting to crack it open for months now.  Part of me is glad to have done so.  The other half regrets doing so as this one might just improve even more with age.  Just be sure to fix the cap if yours is askew like mine was.  This was from the special Ratebeer release (batch 64).
Aroma / Appearance - Sherry, vanilla and oak make it obvious that a barrel was involved in the process of aging this beer.  Also strong are resin notes.  Despite its age this one still has quite a lot going for it.  The thin ash white head lingered for a long time before admitting defeat halfway through the bottle.  Underneath was a cherry (wood) colored body with not much carbonation.
Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel was thick and rich from the start.  It filled the mouth and throat with great maltiness offset by a creamy vanilla profile.  Caramel came next before the alcohol began to assert itself.  I look forward to trying the regular version to see how it changed due to barrel aging.  The sherry finish made me regret knocking off the dregs of the bottle.  Hopefully there will be a future release of this so I can try it once again.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

It has a big aroma with a nice thick oakiness with streams of creamy caramel seeping through the wood. I also get mild muted citrus and pine hops, a hint of yeast and more wood. First sip, darn this tastes good. It starts thick, malty and creamy caramel followed by a pile of dried out oak logs. Then the muted citrus hops show up and grow to an almost bitter note. Near the finish some dark fruity esters show up with the hops, creamy caramel and malts to add an extra flare to an already tasty mixture. YUM!!","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Courtesy of the one and only Ibrew2or3. Pours out a very nice looking color, but unfortunately for me its hard to explain. Definitely some dominant orange, but also a nice reddish hue as well. Some sediment detectable in the bottom of the glass. Not much, if any head, but a swirl brings up a nice layer of foam atop the beer. Nose is immense, citrus and tropical fruits, dark sweet malts, earthen oak barrels, caramel and toffee. Some fusel heat on the nose as well. More of that in the flavor profile, along with nice hints of musty oak, caramel, dark tropical fruits and malts. The sweetness is ever-present but kept in check wonderfully by the earthiness from the oak barrel aging. I really love the musty note that this beer has all over the place, I can only assume this is from the aging that took place. Viscous palate, slightly sticky but far from cloying. Very coating in the back of the throat and warming from the alcohol. Caramel, fruit and oak continue for quite some time in the finish. Outstanding.","Tampa, Florida, USA","Quake1028"

3027,"2007-12-04",4.4,"Hazy opaque orange/copper color with a fine creamy head.
Scent of Vanilla, wood, prunes, traces of smoke and shoyu as well.
A quick, short-lived sweet apricot & cherry front that was quickly overwhelmed with a vinous oak middle, followed again by sweetness but this time more malt than fruit, strong oak in the follow with some Burton mineral saltiness and again a sweet flavor, like a fat juicy purple plum. This is quite an interesting concoction that has in its complex mix of flavors more twists and turns than a rollercoaster but the flavors mesh together quite nicely.  Has a great velvety mouthfeel with just the right touch of carbonation for the style. I really enjoyed this beer and look forward to drinking more of it on my next trip back to the US.

Pours deep red-brown with stupendous lacing. Powerful vanilla oak nose atop sweet caramelly barleywine. Ultimately too much vanilla oak - this one would benefit from some more age - but dang if it isnt good anyway. Perfect mouthfeel, just a hint of alcohol burn late, sweet flavor with orange creamsicle, lemon, butter toffee, muscat wine. Despite the vanilla oak this thing just keeps growing on me....wonderful.

Hands down a fantastic barley wine, masterfully put together, exhibiting a plethora of unique and intriguing flavors, most of which we detected are probably imparted by the length of time this beer spends in oak. Hazy saffron color with a foamy off-white head and seriously sticky lacing. Looks fantastic. Aroma is a blend of orange citrus, light caramel and toffee, with slight peppery spice and toasted wood. Flavors move from sweet caramel and malt into an intriguing blend of tobacco and oak with a warming finish.

Poured a deep orange, hazy golden hue with a grappling yet small swirly, wispy off-white head. Unique malty sweet aroma.  Notes of tannins from the oak barrel and a bountiful whiff of brown sugar and honey sweetness. Resinous and raisin-ous.  Sweet fruits and nuts come to mind.  Distinct Hair of the Dog aroma that I cant describe except by referring to the brewer.  Caramelly, boozy, with notes of cognac or brandy.

3027,"2007-11-10",3.9,"Bottle from aracauna, batch 64. The pour was much more tame than regular HoDF, yet for a barrell aged production, pretty carbonated, steady bubbles rising in the hazy orange/amber body, light peach colored head, great retention, sticks around, laces well, almost continuously on the walls within an inch of the surface anyway. The aroma was a gentle blend of oak, maple, caramel, and pine. The flavor was zingy piney brandy, wet wooden oak, caramel, molasses, vanilla, tobacco, and all sorts of light fruit notes of somewhat indistinguishable (peaches, apricots?) character for each sip, and even some darker fruits (rum soaked raisins). The alcohol was quite smooth and gentle, but this thing got a little liquor-bwine sweet, despite a good zingy piney hop finish with prickly carbonation. Sure, its all part of the style, so its not a killer, but it did keep this from knocking my socks off. A much better experience than my earlier singleton w/ regular HoDF, but that could also be in part due to evolving taste buds. Thanks, Jacob!","","User37895"
3027,"2007-11-09",4.1,"(Bottle,  thanks BierKönig) Pours amber with a small off white head. Complex but strange aroma of seafood, lemon and dill. Wood tones of vanilla, butter and hints of coconut. Also a quite malty nose of caramel and toffee. Fruits and dried fruit notes of oranges, prunes, apricots, ripe cherries and slightly unripe mangos. Undertones of tobacco, sticky sweet liquorice, boiled carrots, some alcohol warmth and a subtle spiciness. Woody and malty flavour with tones of butter, vanilla, coconut, caramel, some cookies and a hoppy backdrop of sour/bitter lemons and oranges. Quite vinous and port like. Rather fruity in the flavour as well with tones of plums, cherries, mango and apricots. Hints of tobacco, smoke and mint.  Medium to full sweet and medium bitter with a light sourish edge. Round and sticky mouthfeel. Medium dry finish. Lingering afterbitterness with wood tones hanging on until the morning light. Medium to full bodied.

12 oz bottle from mj / Cletus (received one from each of these guys recently).  Pour is cloudy orange golden ruby with a perfectly formed one inch off white head.  Thick lacing forms and sticks on the side of the glass.  Very pretty.  Aroma of the vanilla oak barrel, fresh cut wood, citrus fruit, resin raisin sweet maltiness, all really nicely melded.  Taste is the honey raisin sweet maltiness, toasted and biscuity - followed quickly by floral orange citrus and a pretty heavy dose of the fresh oak woodiness.  The alcohol is apparent in the back of the swallow.  Very full flavored, everything works nicely together.  Palate is sticky, medium to heavy with a long satisfying aftertaste.  I think I like how the age mellowed out the previous sample I had, but this one fresh is delicious as well - in a different, more vibrant way.  Hair of the Dog pretty much never lets me down.  Thanks Mike or John. (9,5,8,4,18 - 4.4)

Rating #600.  12 oz. bottle from CaptainCougar.  Batch #64 - ratebeer special release.  Pour is a hazy orange-ruby color with a smallish (1/3 inch) off white head.  There is quite a bit of carbonation, tiny bubbles which continued to climb up the edge of my glass for almost 35 minutes after the pour.  Aroma of sour-sweet fruit, some raisin, even some orange citrus.  Malt is also very present in the nose; big, round, and biscuity.  Just a hint of the oak wood barrel.  Taste is immediately the sweet, sour citrus hop and the biscuit malt.  The buttery oak really comes out in the finish and the after taste is almost smoky (not really roasty - more burnt).  Sounds odd, but was a really nice compliment to the flavor.  Really soft on the palate.  So many flavors, yet still very elegantly balanced.  No hint of heat whatsoever.  Beautifully made beer.

Really wonderful nose.  Big toffee, oak, caramel malts, raisins, yeast, and other dark fruits all compliment each other well.  Tons going on here, very complex!  The flavor had a good little intensity to it.  Just slightly tart, with a big oaky, caramel character backing it up.  Fairyl easy drinking for such big alcohol.  The barleywine characters are really mellowed from the oak aging, but the flavor has really been enhanced because of it in my opinion.  Awesome brew!","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
3027,"2007-10-24",4.6,"Courtesy mgumby10.  Thanks Mike! Holy mother....this is a badass beer!  Cloudy, dark orange-amber body with swirly, sedimentary layers.  Minimal wispy film for a head.  Thin snakes of lacing line the glass randomly.  The aroma is absolutely perfect.  If God himself designed a perfect scent, this would be it.  I sniffed this beer for a good 10 minutes before I took a sip.  Where do I start?  Toffee, caramel, candied walnuts, candied pecans, brown sugar, oak, vanilla, and cream all flood the nose.  I could go on and on about the richness and complexity of the aroma.  It basically smells like a masterfully crafted, sweet, nut coated dessert.  The flavor is more of the same.  Sweet, though it has just enough hoppy punch to make it very palatable.  Nuts of seemingly every variety play a prominent role.  Pecans, walnuts, and hazelnuts, all coated in brown sugar and lightly caramelized.  The oak adds a smoothing vanilla quality, while the perfect amount of hops add a subtle balance to this malt monster.  Medium-full bodied and smooth as silk.  Fantastic beer!  Damn near perfect.

Batch #64 Murky tawny brown body, smallish dense creamy beige head. 3+ Strong woody notes in the aroma over a familiar but undefinable fruit notes, brief incongruous hints of baking flour. Flavour is bitter, but not overly so. Rich supporting malt is fairly straightforward, but has fleeting streaks of caramel, and the characteristic tangy hoppy malt of the underlying Fred. Hints at a rich warming character of brandy occassionally. Wood plays a relatively minor accent role which I like - subtlety and poise rather than the in your face bombasity of many beers aged in wood. Smooth medium palate is appropriate.

First sip was sampled far too cold and little flavor except the oak was decetable. After warming up some this beer really comes into its own. I can definatley say that the wood character is amazing here and the oak is a wonderful focus point of the brew. However, there is a toffee and caramel sweetness about the whole thing that is just amazing. Hops are not nearly as present in this barleywine as normal, is this even really a barleywine?

Bottle. Batch 64. Pours a cloudy orange-amber with some floaties and an average size lasting off-white head. Aroma of oak up front followed by sweet malt, fruit and hops. In the aroma the oak/bourbon is not overpowering which is nice, but in the flavour its much more in your face, not insanely but still a bit too much for my liking, along with sweet malt, fruit, some hops and a slightly boozy and bitter finish. Medium to full bodied. Ive rated this slightly higher then I actually enjoyed it because of the predominance of oak and how sick I am of that, but its still a very well made beer and I did like it, I just didnt love it.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"

3027,"2007-03-27",3.8,"The aroma was strong malt and HUGE oak presence.  The oak tannins overshadow all else in the aroma. Behind the oak was a nice caramel and biscuity backbone with citrusy hops. The appearance was hazy orange amber with an off-white and very tight bubbled head that lasted to lace the glass. The flavor was citrusy with again a very strong presence of oak. The oak tannins were strong and worked well with the citrus nature of the hops. The bitterness level was nice and well achieved and the malt which balanced was of course overshadowed by oak. The finish was dry with lasting impressions of malt and hops, and an oak presence that could not be denied. The body was full and viscous and with the moderate level of carbonation the beer was creamy in the mouthfeel. An excellent barley wine without the oak and a notch less with, mainly because the oak is just a bit out of balance with the entire presentation. 12 ounce bottle - batch 64.","North of Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","NicerInPerson"

Sweet smells of cake and brown sugar at first, but as it warms, theres more wood, bourbon, pepper, tea, light mint, and a pretty strong sense of alcohol.  Tastes of brown sugar sweetness at first, followed by some caramel, tobacco, wood, while a bitter burnt and earthy hop note gradually settles in the flavor profile.  Fairly hot.  Finishes very earthy, moderately bitter and is as complex as any of the other qualities of the beer.  Lots of earthy warm hop flavor with a bit of a woody charred bitterness that thankfully tastes like it belongs.

This very intoxicating aroma also features notes of apricots, dates, big orange cake, some smoke and sweet bready caramel malt. Reminds of Immort Ale somewhat. Flavor has more citric hops, even drier woodiness. The wood flavor increases exponentially in depth and complexity throughout the mouthfeel, most notably in the long and lovely finish. I think this would pair admirably with Unagi and peanut sauce, ginger soup as well.

Flavor is very nice but theres something about it that prevents me from crowning it. perhaps its the american oak and how strong that type of oak is, maybe id prefer french oak or a wine barrel. im rather sensitive to vanilla flavor and perhaps the oak creates to much vanilla for my liking. however, as after 6oz or so I got used to the sharp oakiness and it no longer bothered me. every sip sits on the palate nicely for a long time. very impressive. alcohol is barley noticible and well hidden. a very impressive beer and due to the oak aging its a BW that stands apart from the others. i wonder how this beer will age.4.

11/21/07, 12oz bottle, RB series. aged 17months. pours hazy golden-amber with off white head that last the whole time with great head retention for a barrel aged beer. this is truly a masterful beer, the oak aging is wonderfully done, nothing out of balance, but the oak is impossible to miss. i love how the vanilla is there but it doesnt take over and mesh with the sweetness of the malts. the wood leaves a charred note, but delicate one, nice soft tobacco, and sherry like notes. i cant get over how incredible this beer is. just a joy to drink that is clearly something unique and special. aging well and showing no signs of slowing down. im not sure how age will help this beer but it probably wont hurt it either. awesome stuff. 8/5/8/5/17=4.3.

Hugely complex flavour profile does a tour of duty through generous maltiness, herbal hops, fair bitterness, fruity esters and vinous, oaky barrel character.

The head brings an astringent soapy cheap IPA hop aroma to the nose. The regular Fred was similar, but this is more so. There is also a underlying fruity, caramelly, vanilla.
Some of the same astringent quality showing up in the taste too. More of an oxidized hop/caramel malt thing. Its a very smooth beer. Toned down hops and malt with some sour vanilla. It drinks like candy. Sweet sticky candy.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"

3027,"2006-11-04",3.5,"Bottle: Thanks Kramer17801!!  Hair of the Dog has gained my deepest respect over the course of recent history. I hope this will be another awesome experience for me. The pour is a light hazy amber, but it is very dense and its impossible to see anything on through the beer. An even, bubbly head sits atop the beer for a great long while and fast, fairly dense carbonation is lively throughout the body. The aroma is extremely rich of fresh, juicy, fruit notes. Distinct juicy oranges, pears, and grapefruit all adorn the sweet nose. Hm. . .wheres the oak, oh its there oh so subtly melding with caramel and pineapple. The flavor is much harsher than the nose, it highlights the oak in a bourbonesque fashion much more than the aroma let on. Strong notes of pineapple resonate through my sinuses as I take small sips. The alcohol may as well not even be there as far as taste goes. The initial taste is really bizarre, its like a cup of fruit salad/bourbon, but I soon decide I like this unique profile. I consumed this at cellar temp (which warmed up pretty fast)  based on my general idea of a barley wine, but I think this one may have been better just a few degrees cooler due to the rich pineapple notes. hm, I wish I had another bottle or two to see how this quirky brew would most appeal to me. Either way, I enjoyed the beer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

3027,"2006-10-11",3.0,"Bottle courtesy of Blankboy.  Shared with Blankboy, Hogtown Harry, and MDS.  First off, this bottle was a leaker in the package Blankboy received, so it may not be in prime condition - we are planning on sampling it again around Christmas, so I will rerate then.  Until then though, here are my initial notes to compare.  Really woody, whisky aroma - quite pleasant.  No head, hazy murky brown.  Super boozy, stronger than 10% if that is possible in initial taste.  Tons of wood and rich oak taste, strong alcohol burn.  Im sure there is a beer below all this booze and wood, but I couldnt find it - original Fred is unrecognisable.  A good idea taken way too far, I really didnt enjoy this at all.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
3027,"2006-10-09",4.5,"Thanks to nolankowal for this in a trade. Pours a bright reddish brown with maybe some orange hints and a thin white head. Aroma was strong oak, alcohol, sweet maltiness, and some cigar smoke. Flavor was oak heavy but was balanced between alcohol and maltiness with a slight bitterness. This has one of the best lingering oaky smoke flavors I have ever tasted. Well I love the finish and the only negative thing I can say is that the initial taste is a little too oaky and slightly too alcohol, but dont get me wrong this is an excellent beer.","columbus, Ohio, USA","bgburdman9"
3027,"2006-10-04",4.4,"12 oz. bottle, Batch 64, from Hellomynameis - cant thank Zac enough for this one! If you dont like the smell of freshly cut oak, you aint going to like this! Fortunately, I do, and the aroma says it all. The oak is right up front, with some molasses and whiskey, and maybe a bit of orange. Hazy orange/brown with a magnificent light beige head that just will not disappear. There was still 1/8"" inch left after 20 minutes. Wonderfully rich and smooth with a very light carbonation that seems paradoxical in the context of the head. An almost decadent caramel sweetness that has some vinous qualities, as well as some dark fruitiness. A tangy citrus rind bitterness comes in at just the right time to balance the sweetness. A chewy bitterness lasts until the next sip. Simply wonderful.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"

3027,"2006-09-10",3.7,"RB release bottle, an incredibly generous bonus from RooftopRogue, shared with SuIIy on 9/2/06.Exuberantly frothy, thick-cream-colored head piles atop a surprisingly dark, copper-beige body with some strong tan highlights (Fred being strikingly light in color for a bw).  Medium to medium-high clarity, leaving the sediment behind, with fierce carbonation rushing upwards.  Retention is strong, and moderate lacing is created as the head recedes.  Appearance is always top-notch at HOTD.Grainy wood notes immediately rush forth from the glass, dry and slightly sharp, blending coconut-like notes, some esterized alcohol and an oily, dry, toasty oak and cigar-note that lends just a hint of darkness.  But massively fruity pineapple jumps in to the mix, lightening things and adding a very intriguing fruitiness.  Peaches, nectarines and the like join the fray, and throughout it all, a supple, rich, juicy-sweet pale maltiness helps deliver the support/balance.  Some dry tannins still break through, somewhat, with light paperiness and slightly acidic/astringent vanilla.  I certainly wouldnt call it balanced in the aroma, by any means, but the pale malts, luscious, nearly tropical fruitiness and slight cigar-like edge is just too intriguing and unique to leave behind.  Not to mention, the strength of the aroma is quite high.Continued use of toasty, earthy, dry oak is apparent in the flavor, with a graininess that chips at the palate.  It slowly eases in to the sweet malts, but all the while a touch of sharp alcohol hangs in the background.  Dry fruitiness abounds, which really sets this apart from most BA barleywines, and the yellow fruit nature of it really helps keep things fairly lively in nature.  Carbonation is high to begin, but evens out over time, though it still breaks the malt cohesion perhaps a bit too much, tipping the balance to the more dry, tannic, grainy flavors.  But you cant deny that any juiciness (not to be mistaken with syrupiness) in a barleywine, no matter how fleeting, is quite delightful.  That being said, I still think the barrel is a bit too dominant.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3027,"2006-08-28",4.2,"<!-- p -->RB Edition. I lather up with Ylang-ylang shampoo, and it froths a wispy silk of off-white. Frilly. Out the door, the sun sets on a crystal clear Pontiac evening, with dust particles dancing the light into an array of soft peaches and henna. Someone opens a bottle of honey and blends it with rosewater, cognac and white-tea. A chardonnay cork is dropped on the floor. Out of the shower, I breathe deep over a pot of stewing sage. I take a spoonful and get a wicked mouthful of alcoholic hot rice pudding, replete with raisins and cream. The delivery man arrives with a huge fruit basket of fresh Harry and David Bosc Pears, Honeycrisp Apples and California Plums. We send him out the door with a bouquet of Babys Breath and pine needles. I sneak a pinch of my grandfathers apple tobacco and roll it with tissue paper, smoking it secretively in my closet. My neighbor finishes his bottle of Old Grandad. A bite of the tall grasses in our old potato field leaves a long smack of plant material. It reminds me of firing weapons. Im continually caressed by spicy mexican Vanilla beans, orchid blossom, orange rind and galanal, with musky spice splendor.

<!-- p -->Such insane balance. The fruits are so full of character and distinguishable. The sweetness is not cloying, only pleasurable. And the hop work, out of this world. I was much more taken with this, then I was with the regular Fred. The yeast and bread fade in this example and the fruit malt and alcohol tones really shine. Amazing.

Allowing the head of this glorious, well aged beer, I notice how the foam slides down the side creating creases of lace before disappearing beneath the surface.

3027,"2006-08-16",4.3,"Barrel contribution is immediate, the american oak making an immediately agressive impression, thankfully theyve only aged it 6 months and the size of the base beer must have helped in assuring a healthy balance. Spicy barrel character works like a charm, creating a definitely different beast than the regular Fred, but where you can recognize the signature. Very impressive mouthfeel, whereas most barrel-aging attemps nowadays thin out and dull out the texture on the base beers, this one remains full bodied and vastly carbonated in a belgianesque fierce fat bubbles irrigation manner. Also remarkable is the unoticeable oxidized character that we can generally retrieve in such experiments. Where it lost a bit of its maple richness, its vanilla, earthiness and grapes are all there while the perfumey floral hops get carried on by the herbal, wild wood and morphed orange blossom and apricot juiciness. Still very sweet, but with the usual impressive HOTD sipping balance bringing in the equation enough bitterness to support drinkability.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

3027,"2006-08-15",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 21, 2007 Any first impressions?
-A sturdy sheet of foam aptly protects the foggy dark orange.
-Flying over the glass, one can only perceive some of the many wonders displayed below: dry forests, herb and spice gardens, minty fresh wetlands close to fruity caramel waterfalls...
-Once down on the field, the terrain never plateaus, always keeping the tongue on its toes; maple syrup creeks leading up to abundant fruit trees in valleys laden with spice gardens and tall hop vines.
-Again, that Hair of the Dog lively, almost Belgian-style carbonation in artful, bold American mouthfeel manages a rather splendid palate coating.

What if you dig deeper?
-Some heat is perceived in the aroma, mostly because of the barrel, and it fits with the rest of the perfumes elaboration.
-The oak barrel character gets more obvious with every sip, but is never obstrusive, adding complexity to this already sagacious flavor profile.
-The fruitiness within is too diverse to be accurately described.
-A fantastic Hair of the Dog experiment, with an intelligent use of the oak barrels. What else could you expect from them?

3027,"2006-07-30",3.7,"Bottle courtesy of Rob, a great friend and beer sommelier. :) Pours an expected cloudy orange brown with notes of caramel and vanilla on the nose. A lot of vanilla and wood on the palate when consumed at room temperature, although cold I noticed far more hops. Obviously this is considerably better warmed. Probably needs a few more years to settle, but still its drinking well. Dates and toffee on the palate with some citrus. A fine finish. Well done. Not as exceptional as the ratings might indicate (back in its day when oaked aged barleywines were a bit of a novelty, I could see this commanding very high ratings, but the novelty has faded since).","Illinois, USA","Philip"

3027,"2006-07-28",4.1,"Big woody aroma, smells of freshly cut lumber, either oak or pine. I think maybe some piney hops are contributing to that character. But theres a nice malt presence here, full bodied, caramelized, bready and warming with a tingle of alcohol in the finish (but otherwise well balanced alcohol presence, esp for a 10% beer). Some resiny hop flavors float around the middle of this one, and a big hopping comes through in the bitter finish.  Slightly astringent/husky. Otherwise a nice big barleywine that makes good use of oak aging. Very cloudy amber-brown with a medium foaming head that faded quickly, with minimal lacing.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

3027,"2006-07-24",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2008 Bottle:  Courtesy of Styles.  Aroma is very vinous and has a big oak character.  Behind all of the vinous oaky notes is some faint fruit and caramel.  Hazy orangish-red with a small off-white head.  Flavor starts with some sweet caramel, toffee, and fruit.  Finish has a very strong oak presence that leaves a bitterness on the tongue for a while.  Very tasty, but if some aging could tone down the oak a tad, it would be beneficial. (8-4-8-4-17)
Another bottle courtesy of Styles and a re-rate almost one year later.  Absolutely love the aroma.  The vinous notes are still there, but have become more muted.  The caramel and fruit have increased significantly in the nose along with some notes of honey.  The oak presence is about the same.  Alcohol is there just enough to make its presence felt.  The appearance is about the same, but this one isnt quite as hazy.  Flavor has lots of caramel, toffee, and faint honey up front.  Very nice banana bread presence in the middle.  The oak has definitely mellowed quite a bit, and thats a plus for me as I found it a tad strong when sampled fresh.  There are some very mild citrus hops that I didnt notice previously.  Nice creamy mouthfeel with very soft carbonation.  A great beer to begin with and its really improved with age.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

Aroma is sweet and very oaky.  Strong oak, vanilla, and mild fruit flavor.  Very nice.  The oak dominates the aftertaste.  Actually, it dominates the beer from start to finish.  It (alcohol) warms the stomach a little.  This beer should be awesome a year from now.  Looking forward to a re-rate.<P>Re-rate almost a year later (7/07).  Batch 64.  Aroma remains sweet and full of esters.  The oak in the flavor has diminished some, but not alot.  Some of the doughy malt flavor is starting to come through like it does in most HotD beers.

3027,"2006-07-22",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2006 1 inch, very dense head of fine bubbles.  Light beige in color.  Head reduces slowly with light carbonation.  Very fruity aroma and very complex.  Fresh blossoms, wet oak, sweet tarts, potpurri, and some sweet candied fruit.  YUMMY!!!  Very floral but I cant place the type.  Color is a hazy dark copper brown.  Rich and alcoholic flavor.  Very complex again.  Caramel, light oak, vanilla, more flowers and sweet malts.  Maybe a little honey.  Unfortunately, alcohol dominates thus brew a little too much.  Seems quite hot on the tongue.  Sweet and oaky finish with a lot more flowers again.  I am not sure if all of the floral notes are derived from hops or not.  Almost like there is some jasmine in there.  This is a very good brew.  Hopefully the floral notes will subside with a little aging.  Unfortunately, I am also in thinking with TAR  that this brew may not age very well.  It is lacking a little bit in the heavy malt department that it may not improve with age.  Still a great drink.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"

This is only the second venture into the HOTD brewing company for me, but once again I am very pleased with what Alan has been able to do with the beers they produce.  The aroma is very sweet and definite strong oak presence in the nose of this beer.  I think I started tasting this beer while it was alittle too cold and the oak was dominating the other flavors, but once it started to warm a little the other flavors of sweet malts, woodsy flavors, smoke and tobacco.  The alcohol of 10% is hardly noticeable and this brew is dangerously drinkable.  Overall a very good beer.","Green, Ohio, USA","LeopoldStoch"

Aroma of dark fruits, oak, vanilla, grapes, some alcohol, lots of wood and a great aroma mix.  In the flavor Im getting more of the vanilla and oak up front. Followed by various dark fruits, grapefruit, maple syrup, some hop bitterness sits on the tongue in the aftertaste.  Great palate. I wish I had more of these to sit around and age in my cellar although I kind of enjoyed the fresh hops that I was still picking up, plus I was too anxious to hold out on trying the one bottle I could get my hands on.

3027,"2006-07-18",2.9,"Honey apricot. Tightly-packed covering of sticky foam. Sappy and pungently oaky aromatics with brown sugar and muted phenols. Soft carbonation. Feisty phenols collide with very subtle sprucelike hops which are immediately overwhelmed by highly brash and unrefined hop flavors. Rather than the hops easing you in with soft nuances, they instead unleash a tongue lashing sting along with depthless leafy elements which only hinder the body. Brash citric-rind hop flavors generate more unyielding acidity while sassy oak and vanillin continue to exert their simplistic force, beneath. Plenty of gullet warmth from the alcohol. Ghostlike malts are overridden by a harsh phenolic dryness and thus fail to contribute and real texture. Combination of medicine and oak impart a cedary effect. Oak offers little else than a raw, one-dimensional pungency. No tannins and only the lightest skim of oaken dryness. Finishes soggy and heavily mucky, as medicine, peppery alcohol, and bitter grapefruit assault the palate. All the while, annoying oak pungency lingers for what seems like an eternity. Overall, the hops are extremely soggy, acidic, simplistic, terribly brash, and sorely lack definition and brightness. I should note that Im not a huge fan of their yeast, so I made sure to let the yeast completely settle to the point of there being no haze whatsoever. Despite this, its still responsible for a large portion of the astringency, and when coupling that with the abundance of medicine and hop brashness, this becomes fatiguing after only a few swallows. As is the case with so many other HotD ales, this is showing early signs of infection (bottle-conditioning yeast is likely the culprit). Therefore I predict this will do nothing but rapidly deteriorate as it ages. My humble advice to HotD would be to do what Southampton has done and find a different yeast for bottle conditioning. No doubt a commendable effort for a great cause.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3027,"2006-07-17",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2008 Rerate.  12oz bottle, batch 64, courtesy of glkaiser.  Thanks a ton, Geoff!  Damn, this is good.  Pours a murky, orange brown color; fluffy, light tan head with fine-bubbled retention and lacing that coats the glass; a gorgeous pour.  Lovely, toasted oak and dried caramel presence in the aroma; soft, perfectly integrated barrel aging; inky, dried red fruits; impressively dense malt core, with orange and mineral bitterness present.  The hop character, which showed up as something of an afterthought in the aroma, is far more present in the mouth; full mouthfeel; dense, intense oranges coupled perfectly with toasted oakiness (vanilla, intricate wood presence); tons of fruitiness, with dried caramel (not really from oxidation; just solid malts); dense but well-attenuated, making for a very generous, drinkable beer; no alcohol to speak of.  Im going to be thoroughly disappointed when this bottle is empty.  Lengthy finish, showing toasted wood, breadiness, oak and oranges; a beautifully constructed barrel-aged barleywine.  Goddamn.

3027,"2006-07-10",3.9,"Batch 64.  Clear amber body with a thin, white head.  A big nose of vanilla, alcohol, caramel, coconut, oak, light toast and grain, and some mellow piney hop character.  Its really pretty sweet with subtle barrel-aging characteristics before a mild waft of hop resin.  The body is thick and smooth, with nice, tight carbonation on the tongue, making it a pleasure to imbibe.  The sweet nose translates will to the tastebuds.  The sweet caramel, vanilla, whole grains, coconut, light maple syrup and hint of toasted malt all add to an incredible malt complexity.  The oaky elements helps smooth out the considerable alcohol and the bitter piney and citric hop finish add a crisp smack of the lips derived from pure enjoyment.  My first impression of this was a touch disappointing.  However, given some time to just sit and sip, this quickly became a new favorite.  One of the better barrel-aged beers Ive had.

3027,"2006-07-10",3.8,"12 oz. bottle, special RateBeer release 06/06.  Thanks to DarkElf for arranging the purchase of a case to split!  Pours a slightly hazed watermelon-amber color with a moderate off-white head and thick lace.  Aroma is dominated immediately by a strong oaky scent, sweet fruity malts become more evident as it warms, with raspberry and citrus and prominent alcohol.  Sweet and tart flavor, mellow woody malts, vanilla, brown sugar, orange, then an overwhelming blast of oaky tannins and alcohol, this effect diminishes as it warms from cellar to room temperature, making the experience a bit more pleasant overall.  Full body with nice creamy carbonation.  Its very apparent that this was aged in new oak, as the tannic, woody character seems dominant.  Right now I cant say that this was a great beer, it seems a bit unbalanced and dominated by the wood.  Of course, this is a newly released bottle, and I expect that the flavors will mellow and blend as this barley wine ages, so I look forward to re-rating this in a year or so.","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"

3027,"2006-07-08",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 23, 2006 From 12oz Bottle.  Pours a hazy honey apricot color with a creamy looking off-white head that quickly reduces to a thin film.  The color and texture of the beer is just beautiful to look at.  The arom a is restrained, but tantalizing nonetheless as a slightly tart incense of caramelized almonds, leek vegetalness, and semi-sweet sherry notes drift to my nostrils.  Some maple smoke and pear skins complete the bouquet.  Full bodied, lightly syrupy texture brings a delectable sweetened hop bath to warm the tongue.  A light spruce glaze coats the tongue initially with some sweet tangerine sauce.  I can see the sharp piney edges wearing off with age,which will make this beer even more fabulous for my personal taste bud preference.  This beer is nectar, combining so many of my favorite characteristcis into a neat 12oz package - delcious hop usage, slightly sweet malty notes that remind me of a pineapple glaze glistening atop a roasted ham, full bodied mouthfeel, breathtaking appearance, thoughtful aroma, a gentle tinge of oaky dryness, and a spicy character that I adore in many belgian ales.  I think I might be dangerously in love with this beer.  The finish is also greatly sustaining with more of the hoppy sweetness.

The fruit and spice notes seem to be competing with each other, but both ultimately lose out to the taste of alcohol.

The pour was turbid ruddy deep coppery/brown, with a 1-finger off-white head and amazingly long lasting lace sheets.  The aroma was intyense and complex, consisting of some funky tangerine, mango, oaky bourbon, black pepper, fine tobacco, and some caramel malt in the background.  The flavor....Whoa Nelly let me tell ya bout the flavor, Bob Griese!  At the start it was densely tropical and citrus fruit, with bold mango, tangerine, fig, and plum elements.  Then, the black pepper, oaky bourbon, tobacco, woody peaty malts, caramel malt, and hops kicked in, sort of in a cascading fashion but too quick to be noticed if you dont swallow slowly.

Pours slightly cloudy copper with a thin, creamy white head and decent lacing.  Its average appearance does not foreshadow other attributes.  Aroma was bold, but not overpowering, with floral, citrus, berry and prune notes.  Earthy, woody, rich malt flavor with cigar tobacco, black pepper and nutmeg and/or all-spice.

Up front orange blossom honey hits you the strongest and is followed by yeasty caramel, pollen, fresh-cut wood.  The finish lingers on crystal malt, light peppery alcohol, and more of that floral perfume.  Rich, almost syrupy mouthfeel thats well-offest by light tingly carbonation and the alcohol spice.

3027,"2006-06-26",4.0,"An impressive barley wine.  The hazy amber body surprised me.  Im used to a dark pour.  The aroma was strong with malts, hops evident, some smoke, hints of oak, toffee/molasses, alcohol, vanilla, and buttered rum.  Full bodied and smooth.  The flavor was deep and rich, with all the elements in the aroma making encores.  Warm on the way down and possessing depth of character and good balance of the elements.  Excellent.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"

3027,"2006-06-25",3.1,"Sampled and compared with standard Fred (Batch 56).  Golden color.  Some passion fruit (tangerine and orange) and other hop derived fruit notes in the nose, with hints of raw whiskey.  The nose isnt very expressive overall (especially compared to standard Fred) and it really is lacking oak aromatics.  I smell plenty of whiskey, but want more vanilla, toasted oak and coconut.  Upon tasting, I want more oak.  Typical supporting oak flavors are missing and it seems like the barrel did nothing but add whiskey flavors, not much else.  Where is my coconut and vanilla that I love in bourbon barrel aged beers?  Is my palate shot?  Some fruit notes blend with the whiskey, perhaps some lemon and apricot.  Overall, drinking this left much to be desired.  Oh well.  Side by side, I liked standard Fred much better.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"

Big oak taste expands on the tongue created a lush mouthfeel.  The oakiness helps bring forth flavors of burnt caramel, charred cookie, sweet chocolates, vanilla beans, and rum soaked plums.  The flavors blend beautifully and spiral into a long finish that is soft, smooth and real drinkable.  Leaves a light honey like feel on the tongue. Good god this is one for the books.

An oaky scent seems to be lingering in the background.  Flavor is an onslaught of cigar tobacco, raisin, yeast, and a tinge of orange that sweetens the deal.  Im also detecting a bit of red wine in the background. A very woodsy aftertaste is also apparent.  Palate fully coats and leaves a lingering hint of the flavors.  A great beer; definitely worth another try, preferably on tap.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"
3027,"2006-06-22",3.9,"Bottle, Batch 64. Pretty similar in appearance to the normal Fred: solid muddy-caramel colored with the same yellowish light tan head...but this is about where the biggest similarities stop. The aroma is big and woody, there is a ton of oak in the nose. Elements of vanilla, citrus, yeast and cherry seem to come through at points but they seem to be taking a backseat to the oak at this time...though the fruit/citrus  seems to come through more as it warms a bit. The flavor also holds a good amount of oak/wood character, a bit less vanilla and more bitter citrus hops, cherry, and a brief light sweet malt before it goes back to the bittering hop/wood combo. Warming ,smooth and bittersweet in the front leading to a punch of dry bitterness...back to a nice sweet malty feel and finishing long, bitter, toasty and dry. HOD certainly has a knack for making big complex brews that dont taste like anything else Ive had, while this is no exception, the oak aged profile does remind me of a lot of beers that arent even the same style...the oak seems a bit overpowering right now. Perhaps some age will cut down the oak dominance a bit a bring out all the other great flavors that are on the side stage at the momment.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"
3027,"2006-06-22",4.2,"Batch 64. Cloudy bronze, smallish tan head. It smells like fresh fruit, toast, vanilla, flowers (The Bride says Lillies) and oak. Very floral at first, then the the oak pops up, though fairly understated. Nice salty, citrusy hops, and a persistant black pepper and ppine flavor. As it warms, more of a malt character emerges - molasses, maple, even a bit a vinuous flavor. Something like chestnust or Brazil nuts in the finish.  Actually changes with each sip, and simply giving a laundry list of flavors doesnt really do it justice. Superbly blended and very complex, I cant wait to see how it ages.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"

Then he made me guess - I thought, hmm, Immort Ale, no, thats not as sharp as this. Unbelievable tightly held flavors, huge beer, hold everything well, the aroma is fabulous.

3027,"2006-06-21",4.0,"Bottle.  Batch 64.  Pours a very thick and hazy amber color, with hints of orange and brown.  No real head to speak off.  Aroma consists mainly of malt and oakiness.  Both are also very prevalent in the taste.  Perhaps a bit too much oak right now, but not to the point where it detracts from the experience.  This is a thick and hearty beverage.  Very nice mouthfeel.  A little bitterness on the back.","Harleysville, Pennsylvania, USA","biggcb"
3027,"2006-06-20",4.1,"This was one of the bottles where the cap was a bit crooked, but the bottle pfsshed nicely and the beer had plenty of carbonation. A medium amber-brown. The aroma hit me just on the pour despite being a little stuffed up. I go to blow my nose and come back with clear sinuses and can finally pick out just was was assaulting my olfactory center despite the congestion and distance only minutes earlier. The combination of fresh wood and hops create the impression of cedar so that it smells like the inside of my wifes cedar chest. The wood comes out even stronger in the flavor bring with it notes vanilla and a slight astringency like chewing on a piece of wood. The beer itself is big enough to handle this making for a complex, hoppy barley wine. This could probably use a bit of age, so Im glad I got 6 bottles. This way I can trade a couple and still have a few left to cellar.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
3027,"2006-06-20",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2007 Batch 64, Sampled June 2006
Pours a hazy, orangish amber color and is only lightly carbonated, but still summons forth a 1/2 finger thick, frothy tan colored head, which quickly disappears.  Spicy notes of phenolic oak, perhaps some tobacco and alcohol hit my nostrils as I take my first draught of the aroma.  Rich notes of buttery oak and vanillin soon follow, but the aroma never loses that spicy wood driven edge found in the initial whiff.  The aroma is clearly dominated by the oak notes.  Despite the totally unbalanced leanings of the aroma, I actually am enjoying the woody complexity of this beer.

Ah, the malt is in the flavor.  Up front this beer has rich malty notes of toffee, caramel and toasted grain.  The malt notes are soon joined by buttery oak notes that move to a finish that is a mix of spicy wood, bitter hops and a touch of alcohol.  The oak really lingers on in the finish as well, a combination of oak-butter and astringently tannic wood notes.  This beer is quite pungent, in both it barrel character and also its hop notes.  The hops, while at first not that evident, are here as a major contributor as well.  Zesty notes of sweet orange peel move into notes of tangerine and are jointed by menthol like notes pine.  The beer has an upfront bitterness that is noticeable from the start of your sip, through to the lingering finish.

The oak probably gets in the way of the drinkability of this beer, but it adds a whole other layer of complexity to this brew, that almost offsets the loss in drinkability.  I really like that the hop notes are still quite pungent in this brew, while it does not compare to a fresh Fred, it again adds lots of much needed complexity to offset the, perhaps, dominant oak character.  As the beer warms the flavor gains even more balance; that fresh Fred hop character steps up a bit and helps to balance out the oak notes even more.  While this beer has always been quite good during this journey through my 12oz bottle, this beer is only getting better as it warms up and as it slowly disappears from my glass.

The aroma is full of oak  almost like being in a shed full of freshly split, green oak wood. There are notes of earthiness, leather, orange peel and alcohol. The flavor is dominated by the woodiness. Still, the beer starts sweet  brown sugar and ripe fruit  and quickly turns tart, then bitter. However, the warmer it gets, the more the sweet malts present themselves. The finish is peppery and warm. Throughout is the taste of wood. Medium body with a fairly clean, crisp palate with only a slight stickiness. Moderate to long finish. Looking forward to revisiting this batch in a couple of years.

Batch 64 revisited 1-8-2010. The heavy oak aroma and flavor has faded. Aroma is still sweet with brown sugar and fruits along with notes of earthiness and leather.

Also (when colder) you get hints of spiciness that could be pine like hops and a metallic twang (disappears as it warms).  As for the flavorIts Hot!  Alcohol in abundance and LOTS of oak.  The sweetness is upfront and pleasant but it is bullied by the oak, congnac and creamy mouth feel.  You move quickly through a variety of tastes including dark fruit (pervasive but subtle) and caramel.  As it warms the flavors really come out and you get some licorice or sassafras and pine hints.

Made a good appearance, poured a solid orange hued amber with a thin fizzy head that settled into a fine lacing, very minimal amount of sticking, medium carbonation.

Had a nose of caramel malts, piney and herbal hops, a light citrus, a subtle oak woodiness and whiffs of softly spiced alcohol.

Oak, raisin, grape, vanilla and caramel blend together in an aroma that is enticing and strong, but not over powering in any one dimension. Flavors of oak, toasted malt, resinous hops, caramel, and raisin make up the palate, with the oak being a bit on the strong side, but not enough that everything else is buried by it, but you do have to   look for it a bit.

The aroma is very woody...big hunks of wood.  Strong vanilla with notes of brown sugar, fruit and some alcohol and light smoke.  Fruity flavor with a mild tartness, sugar, big wood, vanilla and some alcohol.  The wood really shows up in the finish too.  The finish drys out a little with a mild bitterness of fruit stones.  Nice warmth.  Medium to full bodied and silky but not so thick that you cant drink a full bottle.  I cant wait to see how the oak, malt, and alcohol age.  Hopefully I can save at least one for 5 years not that it needs it.  Drinks just fine now.

Re-rate (no # change) 10 minutes later.  The last few ounces were left to get warm and the fruit really explodes in the aroma and flavor.  The mouthfeel gets real soft.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
3027,"2006-06-13",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2007 12oz. bottle (RB Batch 64). Hazy orange/amber color with a medium sized off white head. Awesome aroma! Aroma was initially tart and citrusy, followed by lots of oak, toffee, vanilla, mild smoke and alcohol. Kept sniffing for a good five minutes before the first sip. Big time oak flavor with lots of alcohol present. Toffee, vanilla and a tartness that reminds me of grapefruit pith. Nice warming alcohol finish. I could have sworn the alcohol was higher than 10%. In some beers you like the way the alcohol is hidden. In this beer the alcohol presence adds to the overall complexity of the beer. Thank you Alan Sprints!","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","jimmack"
3027,"2006-06-13",4.7,"Great stuff.  Special ratebeer.com bottle from liquid solutions.  So yummy.  All the molassas, caramel, raisin, dark dried fruit in the aroma.  Aromas were much sweeter than the flavor came off.  Flavor brought out the wood.  Oak and Smoke.  Then the other flavors came in too.  Some alcohol, but not much really.  Oh So Good","Santee/San Diego, California, USA","fordest"
3027,"2006-06-12",4.6,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2006 Bottle from the RB release.  A deeper amber color than the stock Fred, reddish hues when backlit.  Redolent with oak in the nose, with a definite hop presence, malt is honey-like, sweet and subtle.  Moderate tannish/khaki head and spotty lacing.  Full bodied and quite smooth.  For using a fresh, American oak barrels the wood presence doesnt overwhelm as much as I anticipated.  Vanilla, some honey and moderate tannins blend quite nicely with the base beer.  Pleasant hop bitterness and flavor towards the finish.  This is one to age and savor on special moments!!<P> Bottle sampled 26 November 06.  Appearance notes remain the same.  Still huge oak in the nose, loads of tannins.  Tart and drying feel.  Holding up quite nicely, this one was from a barely capped bottle.  More than acceptable.","Alabama, USA","11026"
3027,"2006-06-09",4.4,"12oz bottle from batch 64 (ratebeer.com 2006 release).  Pours translucent deep amber.  No light rays pass directly through this stuff.  Subtle aroma (though I will admit to be getting over a cold) of earthy apples and citrus, with some alcohol and oak.  In the mouth it starts with honey, then the oak comes in with vanilla, followed by alcohol.  Aftertaste literally tingles on the tongue (I get the same sensation from grapefruit juice), and is heavy with oak.  Definite alcohol warming.  Subsequent swallows get more earthy and oaky, with a slight bitterness.  Very mellow and lush in the mouth.  If this is really a barley wine, its the best Ive tasted.  The hotd web site cites it as a ""golden strong ale"", though. This beer is an amazing piece of craftsmanship, and Im honored to have been able to sample it.  It is one of two beers (the other being a 2005 Dark Lord) where everything is almost perfectly in balance (personally, I might like the oak toned down a hair, but Im pretty anti-oak).  It doesnt have any stand-out attribute, which is whats so outstanding in a big beer.","Seattle, Washington, USA","acertain"
3027,"2006-06-09",4.6,"Bottle poured a beautiful cloudy copper with a small but lingering light amber head. Aromas of toasty oak, carmel, vanilla, fruitiness and a hint of honey. Palate was medium bodied and very smoooth. Flavors of [heaven?] vanilla, toasty oak, a hint of good bourbon, apples, pears, melon and light citrus with an extremely pleasent lingering bittersweet finish!!! Thanks Alan, this beer really rocks!","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
3027,"2006-06-07",4.6,"Just got this wonderful beer from Liquid Solutions.  Hazy orange-amber, very slight head, wonderful aroma - woody, fruity and moss, very complex.  The first hit is alcohol, then a wonderful woodsy, grass and maybe hay rolls over the tongue with a hoppy after taste.  The beer has a very chewy moutn feel.  As this beer warms, I get more citrus.  This is an incredible beer.  Thanks, Alan.","McKinleyville, California, USA","gwfrankpsu"
3027,"2005-12-04",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 9, 2009 Rerate 06 Ratebeer special release.  Deep amber-orange beer with a huge tan-beige head.  Aroma is lovely.  Soft fruity nose.  Lightly peachy with a lot of strong vineous notes.  A nice sweet vanilla oakiness and a bit of mintiness on the back.  Its aded really nicely... sweet and vineous with a lot of woody complexity.  Earthy/chewy hoppiness.  Very delicious.

Clouded amber hue, good head formation. Strong fruity, prune, aroma, fairly creay with milder tropical fruity balance. Strong sweet fruitiness on the palate, jammy, raisins and cherries, touch of vanilla, warming alcohol finish. Very port like. Exceptional.","California, USA","BeerLimey"

3027,"2004-08-29",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 24, 2006 6/23/06.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, obtained from Liquid Solutions via mail order 6/9/06.  RateBeer Release.  RERATE.  Lightly hazy orange caramel color with a moderate-to-thin, mostly tightly-formed light cream head, fading slowly to a thin surface dusting.  Lacing is average-- spotty, uneven, but finely sanded and somewhat sticky where it falls.  Aroma is wicked as ever, but not quite what I remember-- extremely fruity, yeasty, hypnotically woody with a waxy, sweet-and-sour vanilla essence.  The caramel character is even doughy like cinnamon cookies.  Flavor is a little rough in comparison, plenty of tobacco (a mixture of sweet, soft new cigar and spent ash-- theres a definite ashen prickle to this) and still featuring the wax-wood and vanilla, but also met with a bubblegummy and prickly hop presence, just a bit too raw at this stage (although with the sourness hinted at in the nose, Im really not quite sure how this will age).  Mouthfeel is outstanding-- fine carbonation is fluffy, fuzzy and tingling, intertwined with the snippy alcohol bite and gentle warmth, all surrounding a full body that packs an astoundingly dry, sappy finish.  Vanilla, dry wood, faint vinous sourness and fruitiness, over-toasted sugar cookies where Mom forgot to add the sugar.  Still, quite a treat.  Thanks, Mom!

ORIGINAL RATING: 8/28/04.  Poured out of 1.5 L bottle, sampled at Dr. Bill and Steinys 8th Annual 12-Hour Beer Festival in Orange, CA 8/28/04.  Pours a lightly hazy orange-caramel color.  Slight head that lingers in a rocky ring.  Not much lacing at all.  Lovely round caramel nose and a very mellow, subdued wood character.  Very subtle and inviting.  Touch of sweetness and bitter hops.  Huge body.  Touch of wood sourness masking an awesome velvety sweetness and then finally a dirty bitter malt.  Perhaps too much wood, but only slightly.  Amazing body.  Slight carbonation tingle, big alcohol and very dry, numbing finish.  It actually seems HIGHER than 10% ABV, but in a very good way.  A bit of pith in the flavor, a bit of caramel and brown sugar.  Thick, viscous and chewy. 9/3/8/4/18/4.2","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
3027,"2004-08-27",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 18, 2006 Bottle. Head is initially small, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy medium amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (cookie, caramel), lightly to moderately hoppy (apricot, orange, resin), with a strong note of raw wood, notes of alcohol, candy, toffee, vanilla. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, soft carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Not as good as when I had it at the brewery (which was aged longer IIRC).  Too much raw wood in the nose, but otherwise pretty nice.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3027,"2004-08-16",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 8, 2006 RBSG04, DRAFT: Amber-orange with a thin but creamy head. Awesome nose: woodsy, wholesome, fresh, and a little yeasty. Smooth and thick texture. Very complex with meaty malt flavors. Big wood notes. Melded hops, smooth and pleasant. Sweet and warming. A real pleasure to drink.    BOTTLE, RATEBEER SPECIAL RELEASE 2006: Some may have had capping issues, but my bottles were great ... opened with a healthy pfsst. Hazy and medium amber. Nose smelled of fermented apples in a wood barrel full of caramel. Creamy and weighty palate; nice carb level. Toffee and toast. Warming alcohol. Nippy hops.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
3027,"2004-08-16",3.9,"RBSG 2004, on cask at the brewery:  7 year old sample, bright orange color without much head. Sharp wood aroma with vanilla and a lambic-like funk.  Starts and ends sweet, fizzy mouthfeel, long fruity aftertaste.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
3027,"2004-08-09",4.0,"On tap at the brewery during the RBSG 04.  Buttery nose with tons of oak sawdust, especially in the exhale.  Many more fruity notes than Fred not from the Wood.

3027,"2004-08-01",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2012 Sampled at the brewery in 2004, I was drinking the 8 year old vintage, which I guess puts it at about 1996 or 1997. Appears golden orange, absolutely beautiful nose of wood, scotch, cherries and yeast.  A little bite at the back of the throat, then a smooth and silky texture before a sharp finish of scotch and cherries.  The RB release is an entirely different rating (and more lengthy).  Hopefully Ill get that posted some time.

See above.  I never really got the 2006/RB batch review posted, but I still have 1/2 case sitting around.  Right now Im drinking the new 2008, its bright, sharp, snappy and biting on the tongue.  Spiced honey and sweet Irish whiskey... mmm good.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

3027,"2004-07-30",4.1,"On tap at the brewery RBSG 04: Pours a deeper golden then the new fred. Very little head but decent lacing. Aromas of Oaky sourness and the hops that it has sat on. So many flavors in such a small glass. Starts sour with some residual sweetness and a slight herbal hoppiness. Very sour in the middle and ends with just the slightest hint of bitterness. The alcohol is never apparent. The sourness from the oak is a bit too much for me but I am sure glad I got to try this and Im sure for some, this would be a favorite.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"
3027,"2004-07-29",4.2,"Medium orange color. Aroma is fruity, wood and oak. A medium to full-bodied barley wine This is Fred to an extreme. Malts are fruity, sweet, orange and citrus.

3027,"2004-07-28",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2006 Uh, see my other comments on the original. Ive had both, it was a long time ago that I had this one though. Strange that this is finally being listed as a different beer. 
Rerate, 7-06: Special RB release thing. Pours a murky, glowing brown/orange with a very thin head. Pretty much no carbonation. Fruity aroma of cherries, moderate sweetness, defined oak presence. Taste is lots of oak up front. Soft, fruity sweetness. Noticable floral flavors. Alcohol present but quite well hidden. Palate is incredibly smooth, velvity, so nice. This beer is still great, although a little rough, maybe a little hot right now. I have a feeling it will age quite nicely. Rating reflects previous tasting notes, but this is easily a 4 or better at this stage.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"
