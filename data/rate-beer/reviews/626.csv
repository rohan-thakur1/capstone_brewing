626,"2017-04-27",3.9,"Rating this from memory as I forgot to tick this one, but drinking single shot this week made me think of it. Poured dark brown with a decent tan head. Aroma of chocolate, coffee, and light vanilla. Taste is moderately sweet, lots of coffee, light cocoa notes and lots of vanilla. It is a bit too sweet for my taste, but it is well done. Id definitely want more of this if they can it again.","Willington, Connecticut, USA","bellco33"
626,"2017-02-10",3.8,"Pours a deep, dark brown, with minimal head. Aroma has hints of coffee, chocolate, and dark fruit. Flavor is marked by coffee, chocolate, a touch of vanilla, and some licorice. Very smooth mouthfeel and finish. Well-made stout.","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"
626,"2017-01-20",4.2,"Dafk brown, carbonated pour with a crown of cocoa brown Fuzzy mouthfeel with micrograiny residue
Nose is attractive vanilla coated coffee
and a smell of a damp cloth. OK this is the last can from my dreamlike visit to the remote Monson brewery so its two minths old. The fresher ones I recall packed a sweeter profile.","California, USA","popway"
626,"2016-12-08",4.6,"Can. Thank you Jon! 

Dark brown body with a soft beige collar that fades rapidly. Lovely aroma of dark roast coffee beans and sweet vanilla. The flavor is incredible. Bold, yet gentle. Assertive and elegant. What a beer. A dessert beer, but one I would happily consume in quantity. The vanilla aspect is spot on. Tree House proves yet again they are a world class operation.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
626,"2016-12-05",4.1,"Can to snifter. Thanks, Nik. Looks like a latte in the glass at first. Super creamy beige head on a thin black beer. Sweet creamy coffee. Really smooth. Lactose imparts very sweet up front flavors. Good coffee bitterness on the back end.","Michigan, USA","Booga"
626,"2016-12-03",4.2,"Thanks Mike for the can! Poured into a snifter showing pitch black with sparse latte colored foam. 

The nose shows strong roasted coffee with notes of vanilla in between. 

The palate is light bodied and well carbonated. Flavors of strong espresso brightened with intermittent notes of vanilla. Finish is a perfect mocha caramel bitterness. This is beautiful.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"
626,"2016-12-03",4.1,"Dark black. Medium khaki head. Smells like coffee. Tastes like dark roasted coffee. Medium body. Somewhat acidic. Underwhelming vanilla, but the description warns me of that. Too hard to wait for this to warm up! Tasty.  This would prob be a top 10 beer for me if it were thicker.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","gregwilsonstl"
626,"2016-11-27",3.5,"16 oz can shared with ebone1988. The pour is a lighter black with a lighter tan ring of head that sticks around with no lace behind. The aroma is definitely sweet and milky. There is a roasty malt to it with a light vanilla. There is a sweetness about it that is a little overbearing. The sweet is just huge. The flavor is a little better. There is a strong milk sweetness and a good bit of chocolate and roasted malt. The vanilla is light, but detectable and it balances out nicely. The mouth feel is lighter and thin with a decent carbonation and a lingeringly sweet milky finish. This isnt a terrible beer, but I was hoping for a little more.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

626,"2016-09-05",3.7,"Can @ Mikes House. Black in color with a small tan head. The nose is huge on the vanilla. Almost an Oreo thing going on. Some chocolate, coffee, and a touch of roasted malts. Theres a nice sweetness to it and a decent bitterness at the very end as well. Kind of thin bodied, though, and definitely light on carbonation. But, the beer tastes good.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

626,"2016-08-05",3.8,"Can. Pours a chocolate brown with a small bubbly off white head. Aromas of coffee, chocolate, cream, vanilla is light in the background. Flavor follows the nose perfectly, but this feels like a lesser beer to the regular Single Shot.
