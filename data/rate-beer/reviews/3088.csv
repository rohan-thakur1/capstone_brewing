3088,"2017-06-03",3.9,"Smoked stout from Dark Horse, older bottle from Biergenot but I cannot be bothered by its age as heavy stouts / porters in general and smoked ones in particular tend to keep very well... Irregular, deep brownish beige, moussy head lacing in dots, dissolving almost instantly in the middle but retaining well around the edges with some thin patches of greyish foam in the middle, atop a black beer with hazy chestnut brown edges. Aroma is indeed smoky but quite roasted as well, with hints of charcoal (not much smoked bacon though), a lot of caramel, fondant chocolate, cold black coffee and even coffee liqueur, dried sage, bayleaf, leather, burnt toast, pralines, candied fig, kahlua, burnt barbecued meat without the meat, Cuban cigars, hazelnut oil, liquorish, salmiak, roasted peanuts, butterscotch, iron-like clotted blood, hint of black cherry juice and only the faintest hint of - in this case - very elegant, very old madera-like oxidation. Dried fruits in the onset, some very subdued fig and raisin sweetishness with a dimly sourish edge and light umami accents of roast beef and - far away - dried porcini, altogether very clean and to the point, softly carbonated with a slick, smooth, oily mouthfeel, with something very vaguely metallic on its edges. The sourish roasted barley persists through a middle phase of nutty and very toasted black maltiness which gains a coffeeish roasted bitter character before the finish, with those dried fruit aspects on top; ends bitter and a tad ashy with that smoked bacon-like factor woven into it, but nothing is overdone here, this beer keeps itself together perfectly till the last drop. I get a very, very faint hint of retronasal oxidation, in this case only adding some complexity; finishes with ongoing roasted and mildly smoked maltiness, peppery hop bitterness and a faint afterglow of warming, gin-like alcohol which does not otherwise interfere with any of the aforementioned flavours. Roasted, coffeeish but also more gentle, lovely bitter chocolate bitterness is the lasting impression after swallowing, as the smoke thing has already faded at that point. Very nice, gracious example of a smoked stout; ever since Alaskan started its famed Smoked Porter, it is usually porters who get the smoky treatment, but this surely qualifies as a stout, with the black roasted bitterness remaining the prime factor in the overall profile of the beer and the smokiness having been added as an extra touch, presenting itself stronger in the nose and retronasally than in the actual flavour, though the Rauchbier association is always there from the first sip to the last. Not too complex but technically very well done, going straight to its own goal without further ado, in an elegant, clean and very well-balanced manner. Very nice beer in its specific context and its age - Im roughly guessing a few years - has indeed been of practically no influence, apart from this very slight background hint of maderisation, which only made this more beautiful. Highly recommended to those who are into smoked porters, even though this is indeed a stout in its general make-up.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Jedno z ostatnich piw zakupionych Żywcu, ponownie z powodu rekomendacji na ratebeer. Jest to wędzony stout z Browaru Dark Horse ze Stanów Zjednoczonych. Uprzednio piłem kilka innych propozycji z tego browaru, ale tylko jedna (Pelkulator Coffee Dopplelbock) wywarł na mnie naprawdę duże wrażenie. Pozostałe, choć oceny miały również wysokie, nie rzuciły mnie na kolana. W tym przypadku o zakupie zdecydował obiecana wędzoność, jednak nie jest ona tak wyraźna, jak choćby w rodzimym Smoky Joe (zwłaszcza wersji fanowskiej). Barwa jest bez zarzutu - czarna, jak smoła, jednak piana mogłaby być nieco bardziej trwała. Aromat jest adekwatny, choć dla mnie bardziej przebijają się melanoidyny, niż nuty wędzone. W smaku są one także nie tak wyraźne, jak oczekiwałem. Zaznaczone, ale przegrywają z palnością. Ogólnie zatem bardzo przyzwoite piwo, jednak bez szału.","Z±bki, POLAND","tomekk1978"

3088,"2014-04-17",3.8,"Bottled December 23rd. Poured into a Sam Adams Perfect Pint on March 24th. $2.19 single.

Appearance: Pitch black with a fizzy dark brown head that goes away quickly. No lacing. Pretty average.

Smell: Roasty and smokey with an almost caramel popcorn aroma. I really like it. Not as smokey as some other stouts Ive had, but its there nicely.

Taste/feel: Hm. Alright. Well, I can say that its quite bitter, but not a good bitter. A burnt sort of bitter. I cant really so much taste a burnt flavor, but the bitterness reminds me of... burnt. Not in a horrific, it-ruins-the-beer way, but I could do without it. The mouthfeel is more like a porter than a stout, as it feels relatively thin with a medium-to-high carbonation. The smoke flavor is in this beer like it is the aroma -- complimentary, but quite mild. In comparison, the smoke in this beer is a decent bit less significant than the blueberry was in Dark Horses Tres Blueberry Stout. Theres no ""meatiness"" that I love in a good smoked porter or stout, just a smoke and coffee flavor that combines to give an ashy vibe. As it warms, that ""burnt bitterness"" I was talking about goes in the backseat, and a sweetness comes through without accompanied flavors (dark fruits or whatever else).

All-in-all, my least favorite of One, Too, Tres, Fore, and Plead the Fifth if that counts. This would be a good one for people who like stouts, but not so much smokey ones. The smoke is in this beer, but not in a huge way like I guess I was hoping.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

Flavor is deep roasted chocolate, burnt coffee and some light peat underneath the roasted chocolate. Medium to full bodied with a dry texture. This works really well as an Imperial stout, not like a rauchbier. The peat malt is a hint and doesnt overpower the brew. If youre looking for smoke;  get a bottle new. And then it still maybe faint. This works well for me as a stout. The bottled aged really nicely. Rich but not overly sweet. I enjoyed this.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

A - Pours an ink black body. A super dark red/mocha head forms but fizzles away quickly leaving behind the slightest amount of edging. Swirling creates some bubbles, but this sits rather still and cola like.

S - Lightly smoked malts and copper pennies. A little bit of chocolate but the aroma is very tame and subdued. 

T - Tootsie roll chocolates, Maraschino cherries, vanilla. and light roasty malts. Again, subdued and tame. Mouth feel is medium bodied and becomes denser after a swirl in the mouth. The alcohol is extremely well hidden, so theres a positive.

3088,"2012-04-23",4.0,"Originally reviewed: 11/4/10. 12oz bottle poured into a pint glass. Pours a very thick gluggy black, like used motor oil. A thin mocha head rest atop. Retention was weak; no lace. But this black abyss is haunting. I like it. The nose doesnt yield much smoke. Maybe some hints of charred wood, but it smells of a standard stout. Scents of chocolate, dark malt, faint coffee. A little disappointed theres not more smoke in the nose.

The body is thick and creamy. Perfect for a stout. An easy drinker though. Nothing too filling, but it just coats the palate wonderfully. The flavor doesnt hint that there is much smoke in this either. I guess I was expecting more of a Rauchbier-like smokiness, but this is subtle and definitely in the background. There are hints of the charred wood and burnt toast, but really, the chocolate/coffee combo is the main player. Lots of semi-sweetness, full bready toasted malts, and hints of dark fruits on the finish. As a ""smoked"" beer, this isnt what Id be looking for, but as an easily-drinkable tasty stout, this fit the bill perfectly. Loved it.

Taste is real roasty, with charcoal, but the smoke isnt really that forward. It too comes out a bit when it warms, but its a real dry smoke--not meaty or campfire-ish. Ash on the finish, along with some cinnamon (?). Pretty thick body with nice soft carbonation and a powdery feel. Too dry and roast forward to me--felt pretty one note, and I would have liked to see the smoke be a little more prominent. Disappointed in this one.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

COLORE:
color caffe, impenetrabile 
INTENSITA / FINEZZA / AROMA
profumo  intenso, con sfumature di caffe, cioccolato e affumicato, tutto ben orchestrato.  Una punta di alcohol misto ad un leggero tocco fruttato
GUSTO / RETROGUSTO / PERSISTENZA
entra abbastanza neutra,  lasciando spazio a malti tostati, un affumicato sornione però ben distinguibile, con  successivi toni di caffe e cioccolato nero. Un tocco acidulo che ricorda il fruttato accompagna verso il finale dove si enfatizza un buon amaro torrefatto e qualche luppolo però ben miscelato e non ben distinguibile. sul finale si sente qualcosina di alcol.
CORPO / CARBONATAZIONE / CONSISTENZA
corpo medio, bassa carbonatazione, morbida in bocca.
CONCLUSIONE
nonostante evidenti toni affumicati, direi che rientra  più propriamente in una stout ben strutturata. Cremosa in bocca, con i classici sapori tipici dello stile, tendente forse più ad una imperial stout anche se la componente alcolica rimane  nascosta e  non domina . sapori e profumi ben dosati nelle varie componenti per un prodotto equilibrato e piacevole. mi favorita rimane comunque la black (ale) riserva.

Similar pour as Plead the Fifth. Nose is not really smokey- more very soft bacon, smolder, salty brine, muted barbecue. Almost would pass for normal stout as the dominant profile is roast, tobacco, and dark chocolate. Nose really opens up as it warms and decants into some pretty lovely soft smoke and smolder. Taste up front is watery and void moving to biter dark chocolate and cocoa. Comes across as very thin for 8%- almost no body. Still, it is very bitter and dark chocolate forward with spicy tobacco.

Full-bodied, pleasantly carbonated and with a certain warmth. Sure a pleasant and tasteful one, but I cant forget the Tres Blueberry Stout I just had. 110107","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

3088,"2011-04-04",3.9,"As of the beginning of April 2011, this is classified as a smoked beer here on RateBeer but Id say the smoke is gentle enough that this is a stout through and through. It pours nearly black w/ some deep brown spots of foam. The nose is lush and rich, very chocolatey w/ lots of coffee. An undertone of smoke is present but it is at a level that it could easily be attributed to various roasted grains. The texture is simply lovely and certainly the best part of this beer. Its soft and full, ever so lightly sticky w/ fine carbonation that overall compliments the full smokey coffee flavor very well. The only negative I have to report is a very slight and non-distracting medicinal tinge to the bitterness in the finish. Overall, this is a very nice stout.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

It pours a dense black with a tan head that is fizzy and quickly dissipates.

The smell is classic stout. It has an abundance of dark scents, mostly chocolate and dark toffee. Over this is a very nice roastiness with some coffee and smoked malt scents. It could smell more intense, but the actual scent is very nice.

The flavor carries a bit more smoked malt than the scent. It is dark and roasty in flavor. It like you melted some 80% cacao chocolate into a cup of coffee. It also has a hint of caramel and sweetness.

The mouthfeel is super thick, but it has a noticeable prickling carbonation.

3088,"2010-06-06",3.7,"Pours a pitch black color and nearly opaque as their other stouts do with a small, fizzydark tan colored head that receds quickly and rejoins the body. Very minimal spots of lacing left behind with some small sediment floaties. The nose shows notes of dark chocolate, roasted barley, dark fruit, rich caramel malts, There is just a slight hint of smoke and almost no hops at all. The flavor follows with more dark chocolate and roasted caramel malts dominating, but some dark fruit and figs come through adding another layer of complexity. There still isnt much smoke at all. The outhfeel is full bodied and quite smooth with balanced carbonation leading to a lengthy chocolate covered fruit finish. The flavor is really nice in this one, but I was hoping for more smoke. Still a really good beer, but I will have to rerate when I get a fresher bottle.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured thick, black and oily with a large dark brown head that produced great lacing. The aroma was woody, toasty and roasty with notes of licorice and smoke. The flavor was bitter and roasty with a strong port wine element and touches of smoke and wood underneath.

Flavor is also smoky, maybe not quite as much, but the campfire and smoked meat notes are there along with roasted malts, dark chocolate, molasses, peat, earthy notes, dark fruits, and burnt toast.  Lingering roast and smoke.  The smell and flavor are nice, but not next-level like Yazoo SUE or Alaskan Smoked Porter.  My main problem with this is that the body is a little thin.

I dont get much of the ""smoked"" flavor I was expecting, but then I havent had many smoked beers, so maybe Im not tuned in to it yet.

The taste is smooth velvety chocolate and caramel goodness to midway. It then picks up additional notes of burnt malts and a modest level of smoky notes heading into the finish. Yum, tasty, smooth, roasty and chocolate. Very nice brew.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Cocoa flavor really dominates, some mild bitterness evens it out.  A quality product all the way, the 8% alcohol is expertly hidden.  Some pungency as you get into it.

3088,"2009-07-10",4.0,"Bottle, thanks to tjthresh. Aroma of roasted nuts, chocolate, lightly smokey and peaty. Flavor is increasingly peaty though the level of smoke is far lower than that of most beers classified as such on here. Not that thats a problem, the smoke here is more of a complex addition to a deeply chocolatey stout, and gives the beer an earthy, more roasty, sort of herbal side to things, all seemingly through the smoke. Sort of a tweener in terms of stout vs. smoked, and either way, interesting and tasty.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

3088,"2009-05-28",3.6,"12 oz bottle from the Binnys Singles Rack (Orland Park, IL). I continue my journey down the Numerical Stout Series path. Pours a thick black pour, largely opaque, a little brown around the edges, with small dark brown head that sticks around and laces a bit. Aromas are chocolate, a bit of creaminess pushing some lighter smoked malts, peat, light tobacco, and roasted malts. Pleasant. Initial is a little light overall in body, taking on light smokey, dark chocolate, coffee and roasted malts all in one. The smoke is lighter than expected, light tobacco and peat, but never really approaching the meatiness I was hoping for. A very smooth beer, the roasted malt and coffee display bitterness and roast, light sweetness intervenes, but largely roasted and bitter. A bit more smoke comes through further into the body, but not necessarily in the finish. Instead, I notice it on initial tounge touch. I wanted more smoke in this beer. This is a good stout, with complex flavors, but I simply got greedy and wanted some more smoke. Extremely well balanced. Not bad. Not great. Good.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

3088,"2008-09-27",4.0,"Summary: Excellent chocolate-bodied stout, more ashy than smoked. Aroma: Dark fruits and chocolate, full bodied, stokes the anticipation.

3088,"2008-09-05",4.0,"12 oz. bottle (from Bulldog Liquor- Big Rapids, MI) served in my longing stein- poured blacker than a bad night in Austin once you peel away the horrifyingly false facade, yet another one finger dark tan had formed and tried to steal my car.  Aroma of a darkened malt, perkulated coffee that has been sitting warmed continuously for over 24 hours, and... (insert melodramatic gasp here) SMOKE.  Hits the mouth with a high-medium body, malt seems just a little too thin when compared to the other 3 that I have tried, bits of dark molasses notes in the middle are overpowered by SMOKE and cream, finish keeps going on forever like a brainwashed Obama supporter that just won’t learn to shut the hell up.

3088,"2008-08-10",4.2,"12 oz. bottle into pint glass.  One of the best looking pours I have ever seen - a black oil pour with a great dark brown head - thicker pour than expected.  The aroma is very chocolaty - dark milk chocolate - with a vanilla backbone and a coffee finish.  Aroma is very full and rich with a complexity of subtle aromas that linger between these.  While the aroma is dominated by chocolate, the flavor is dominated by roasted specialty malt and coffee characteristics.  Bitter dry hops on the finish that work well with the bitter coffee notes.  Medium to full bodied on the palate and decently coating; smooth with very subtle carbonation.  Overall: this brew took me a bit by surprise; it is unbelievably good, but a bit confused.

3088,"2008-08-01",3.8,"12oz bottle.  Pours one of the blackest colors I’ve ever seen in any stout, absolute pitch black with a medium sized dark brown, bubbly head.  Aroma is chocolatey, malted milk balls, fairly roasty but surprisingly not that smoky.  When I look for the smoke I can find it but if I didn’t know this was a smoked stout it wouldn’t have jumped out at me in the aroma.  Flavor is chocolatey, pretty much just chocolate actually.  It’s nice and good and leads to a chocolatey finish.  Not much smoke detected in the flavor either.  Surprisingly dry, certainly dryer than I expected it to be.  For my tastes it could use a bit more viscosity or creaminess.  Searching for the smoke I do find a bit of a BBQ flavor but it is certainly subtle, just like the aroma.

The aroma is very smoky with strong tinges of a tart, tanginess. The fruit aroma is like a mix of a kiwi tart and a plum and pomegranate tanginess. It has a medium weight in the mouth with some decent carbonation. The flavour starts with a round dark fruit flavour (leaning more towards pomegranate). The smokiness then quickly overpowers the citrus. Hints of a brown sugary sweetness mellows out the medium bitterness. Towards the finish, dark fruit and soy sauce-like flavours are apparent behind the intensely dominant meaty smokiness. This is so incredibly smoky.

The look: Black body with a small tan head
In long: Not much real smoke in this one.  More like charcoal on the nose and ashes in the taste.  Body is very soft and so is the carbonation.  Some alcohol presence (bad for a 8% stout) and the beer is syrupy like a 12% stout.  Basic extra-roasted malts with some chocolate flavour.  Overall pretty dry despite the syrupy body.

3088,"2008-04-14",4.0,"Big thanks to Tytoanderso for this bottle.  Yep, thats a smoked stout.  Lots of layers of greasy smoky malt.  Theres a little bit of bittersweet cocoa underneath, but its pretty much overpowered.  Some raisin and cherry in there too.  Seems to be a nice complex stout with a ton of smoke on top, which mutes some of the flavors underneath.  On the flip side, the smoke fits in with the rest of the malt profile perfectly.  It also builds an essentially perfect mouthfeel that is slick and smooth, but rich and dense.  Really no hops or bitterness to speak of which doesnt lose it any points, but disappoints me slightly, as Im on a pretty big hop kick at the moment.  Im slowly getting more and more into smoked beers, and this is a really nice one.  Very well crafted.  This is the kind of beer I wouldnt often think to buy a sixer of, but if I saw it on draft and was in the right mood, I would definitely order and enjoy the hell out of it.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"
3088,"2008-04-11",3.6,"12 oz. bottle, no freshness/bottling date, sampled in a pint glass. I checked a couple of other beer websites today and they listed the ABV as 8%. The Dark Horse site lacked this info.

L: Opaque blackish brown with a bubbly topped, creamy tan chocolate head the slowly dissipated into a thin sudsy layer. Like all the stouts Ive tried in the Holiday Stout series, this has an appetizing, taste inducing appearance.

S: Right off the bat, a nice aromatic aroma of smoked peat, whiskey-like, followed by dark chocolate cake with a trace of vanilla icing. In the background is a light char scent, the slightest of dark fruits smells and freshly grounded espresso beans. The alcohol is a barely noticeable mix of peat and fruity esters.

F&T: The medium body, while pleasantly smooth, would benefit from more carbonation. The moderate carbonation gives this a skimpy creaminess, plus I feel that it holds back the malty chewiness and flavor. I would also like a bit more firmness in the mouthfeel too. The smoky peat malt is much more subtle in the taste than in aroma, becoming more charred tasting as you reach the end. In the middle milky chocolate and a mild fruitiness emerges, lending some sweet softness to the overall taste. Finishes on a burnt coffee note, like a coffee pot that has been on the burner for too long.

A decent American stout, but my least favorite in the series, just not as bold tasting as the other offerings. Still, I would recommend that any dark stout fan give this a try just to compare it to the other stouts in the series from Dark Horse, a mid-Michigan brewery known for quality beer.","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"

3088,"2008-03-27",3.7,"[Bottle] Pours black with a small dark tan head. Aroma has a decent amount of smoke when cold, but it is more subued as it warms. Compared to an AS beer this thing has almost no smokiness, but I like that it blends instead of overpowers. There is also a good deal of roasted malt and chocolate aroma in there. The taste is largely roasted malt and chocolate, with a little alcohol, and surprisingly little smoke. Medium mouthfeel with a long finish where finally a little smoke shows through to go along with a roastiness that borderlines on charred. A solid beer.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"

3088,"2008-03-22",3.4,"Velvety, oil black pour produces a thick fudge milkshake of a head, which eventually settles to a thin, transparent glaze.  These non-imperial Dark Horse stouts really achieve another level of blackness for what they are.  Aroma is full of tangy, earthy peat smoke and acrid coffee grounds; the acidic, light roasted coffee character seems to give a fresh, lively zest of grapefruit and tangerine, which is odd given that the initial impression is all dirty, wet and oxidized.  No shortage of dark chocolate and toffee malt underneath.  Tastes very slick and somewhat watery; though very full in texture, most  of the flavor qualities are delayed to mid palate and finish.  That tepid first note is one of peppermint and buttery soft taffy, which gains volume and visibility in the muted, roasty middle, and sort of stumbles into dominance after a failed coup of smoky, rough edged campfire malt.  Thinly smoky.  So reserved.  Confusing.  Buttered toast, raspberry jam, nothingness.  Palate is luxuriously soft and full; a rich pipe tobacco smoke in a slow coating.  Its hard to describe how out of snyc that quieted, meek flavor is with the rest of the experience, especially with this soft, visceral and firmly muscled mouthfeel of a bloody, cocoa dusted flank steak.  Finish brings the rustic smoked meats and juicy, ballsy dark coffees without reservations, which gives a frustrating picture of what this beer might have been all the way through with a little more willingness to kick ass.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

3088,"2008-03-20",3.5,"Bottle. Not being a fan of ""smoke"" beers, I was very wary about trying this beer.  The sell for me was that it was a stout and not a porter.  

For starters, I was fairly impressed with the very black, thick pour.  No head what so ever.  Not very much there with the aroma though.  What is there are notes of smoke (obviously) and chocolate. Upon tasting it, I was surprised, but not impressed.  A very thick beer!  It almost feels like drinking thinned chocolate syrup.  Most of the smoked malt was completely masked by the overwhelming chocolate flavors.  Its almost a little too chocolaty, without enough of the smoke. However, I shouldnt be complaining about this aspect since Im not so hot on smoked beers.  This definitely made me more open to trying more.  Its another solid beer from Dark Horse, but I would rather be drinking their Oatmeal stout","Murderapolis, Minnesota, USA","mtjoseph"
3088,"2008-03-17",3.8,"Finally rating this one.  Poured black with a small tan head.  Smelled of big smoke, like a hearty bacon breakfast around a campfire.  Taste was chocolate, smoke, some roastiness, with a dry finish.  Nice and smooth.  This is by far one of the better smoked beers I have had.  Not too big on the style, but this one is very nice.","Holt, Michigan, USA","masonjer"
3088,"2008-03-15",3.7,"Poured from a 12oz bottle and served in a shaker.  This stout poured an oily, opaque jet black with a thin head of dark tan foam that lasted throughout most of the glass.  Some slippery lacing was left behind.  The aroma of the beer was made up of smoke, light chocolate, heavily roasted malt, and also some earthy yeast notes.  The flavor consisted of mildly bitter heavy roasted notes, strong smoke, strong espresso roast coffee, and some mild chocolate.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with mild carbonation.  If you enjoy smoke and roasted/charred malt, this will suit you just fine.","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

Chocolaty, roasty aroma.  Flavor is similar, although I didnt really enjoy the smokey aspect of it.  Smokey flavor was not overpowering though and this is a solid beer; this just isnt a style that I actively seek out.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","Illini08"

3088,"2008-03-02",3.8,"12 oz. bottle. Poured black with no head or lace. Nose was peaty, wet earth, burnt wood. Taste was heavily roasted malts, bakers chocolate, & mild coffee.

3088,"2008-02-29",3.9,"2/29/2008:  Dark Horse Fore Smoked Stout pours black with a low level of carbonation and a small brown head that diminishes quickly.  Sweet char, roasted malts, semi-sweet and dark chocolate, and dark fruits comprise the aroma.  I dont really pick up and smoke in the aroma.  The front end flavor mimics the aroma and is followed by a darkly caramelized maltiness, lots of roast, coffee, and hints of dark chocolate.  It finished slightly dry.  There really isnt smoke ( meaty, dry beechwood, or otherwise).  This beer is more roasty with char, high cocoa content chocolate, and coffee notes than it is smoky.  Either way, it is still very good!  This beer has a medium-full body and is smooth and silky.   Overall this is a really good Stout, but it is lacking the smokiness that I was hoping for.

Did not get much smoke in the aroma, which is good, or in the taste, which is better.  Just a light wisp of smoke.  Other notes more apparent were roasted barley, dark coffee, chocolate malt.

3088,"2008-02-21",3.9,"Pours the darkest possible, opaque chocolate brown to virtually black body.  A small, foamy, chocolate brown head dissipates quickly to a wispy film with a pronounced edge.  Minimal traces of spotty lacing are noted.  The aroma shows rich dark and light chocolates, chewy nougat and caramel, roasted barley, and some dark fruits.  A light smoked peat aroma enters the fold, adding depth and character.  There are some traditional Baltic characteristics in the nose, as dark fruits and rich, chocolaty malts are uninterrupted by any hop character.  The flavor follows suit, with rich, roasty malts again dominating.  The smoked peat really comes through, blending perfectly with the decadent chocolate and caramel.  Hints of alcohol soaked figs and dates emerge adding yet another layer of malty goodness.  The mouthfeel is just shy of full and quite viscous, with just a hint of cloying sweetness showing after the long, smoky, roasted finish.  What an awesome beer.  Dark Horse knows all things stout!  Great beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Thick dark pour, very handsome, with minimal head. The barley malts are immediately prominent in the nose, and they are satisfying.

3088,"2007-12-02",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2007 Pours black with a minuscule brown head that immediately reduces to a mocha ring clinging to the edge of the glass. The nose is a sweet blend of roasted malt, chocolate and light peat. Medium-bodied, yet fairly thin, the mouthfeel is silky on the tongue until you swallow when some assertive carbonation pops out briefly transitioning into a lightly dry, roasted finish. The flavor follows the nose: sweet, roasted malt with solid notes of bittersweet chocolate and a light, peaty smokiness. Like the ""Tres"", I think this beer is listed in under the wrong style. The ""smoke"" in this beer is only a minor contributor to the character of this beer, but as its name includes the word ""smoked"" Im not surprised to see it labeled as such. After trying the 4 ""smaller"" Dark Horse ""Holiday Stouts"", Id have to say that these guys definitely know how to craft amazing stouts.

Carboniferous and yet higher with bits of brandy marinated fruit, nuts and nice general malt figures. Long smack in the middle of dry and sweet, but generally enjoyable.

Not bad, but Id like to have way more smoke out of a Smoked beer. 6/3/6/3/13  Re-rate 4/22/08:  Black color with a thin head.  Smokey and some oak aroma.

Backed by some chocolate and roast as well.  Not quite as smoky in the taste as in the nose, but it definitely is there.  Nice rich, thick mouthfeel, coats the palate with a warm roastiness.

Not a real big body or big attack; very little carb and the flavor leans a bit much to the smoky side without other elements to balance it. Its a bit watery as well. Pretty much a middle of the road smoker.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Not much smokiness in aroma. Taste is when the smoke flavor kicks in. Taste is chocolate, full body, toasted malt and a touch of peat.

3088,"2007-05-16",3.7,"From a 12oz Bottle.  Purchased at Rileys Wines of the World in Madison, WI.  Pours a completely opaque, dark black color with a thin layer of fine bubbled tan head that quickly dissipates to a thin brown ring.  Aroma of toasted hazelnuts and light charcoal briquette smoke blends mildly with some organic brown sugar and dark chocolate.  Pleasant dimensions, but a little bit too subtle to be as enticing as it sounds.  Light to medium bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel; a bit undercarbonated.  The smoked malt is a great touch; its subtle enough to add a satisfying layer of complexity without going out of control.  Almost a little bit conflicting, as the juicy meatiness of the smoke conflicts with the dry roast bitterness of the roasted malt.  Dark black chocolates and heavily roasted coffee linger with some charred alderwood.  Dry, ashy finish.  Like the other beers in this series, I feel this one could use a bit more mid-malty chewiness.  Good execution and potential, but needs aa bit more body and malt complexity for my tastes.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
3088,"2007-05-14",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2010 Bottle. Pours pretty darn black with a little bit of a brownish head. The nose is chocolatey with a bit of toffee and peat. Im shocked to see 8% listed here. Dark Horse keeps surprising me with that kind of thing. The flavor is filled with chocolate, nuts, coffee and a finish like barbeque sauce. I dont get a lot of the meatiness or smokiness, it really is kind of tangy like a sauce, but even that is minimal. Id say this is a stout first, a smoked beer second.

[April 01, 2010]

Bottle from Marion Street Cheese Market. This is a pretty good example of a smoked stout. It is bold and roasty with plenty of meaty flavors to accompany the more typical notes of chocolate and coffee. I could use more smoke in this beer. Any campfire or bacon flavor is not super strong, more an accent to the malts.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
3088,"2007-05-12",3.7,"12 oz bottle. Pours syrupy thick black with amber at the extremities and an orange- brown head. The aroma is very chocolatey with some hints of hickory and a little bit of espresso. The flavor is bitter chocolate, coffee grounds, woody hops. Some hickory notes come out toward the finish, though more like wood chips than the smoke. Some ash and charcoal in the aftertaste. Very drinkable.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

The mouthfeel was silky and oily. This one didnt win me over, but it was a neat experience and one that Im yet again in-debted to my good tastin bud, Bert. Thanks, Bert!","","User37895"

Smelled very similar to the smoked turkey I put on my sandwiches. I also noted some malty molasses and a whiff of dark chocolate and watered down coffee. Slightly sweet on the tongue with a satisfying, thick stouty mouth feel. Carbonation was on the lighter side. The smoke is less pronounced in the flavor and gives way to a rich, chocolatey malt.

Viscous, full body is silken and dry with strong, tangy stoutsour in the main and light sour cherry in the end.  Loads of oily dark malt in the taste with some ashtray and faint malted milk.

Charred hickory, wet earth, stale pipe tobacco and bitter chocolate are immediately apparent in the nose, leading into the equally malty body.  Earthy, burnt malts and a creamy mouthfeel create a heavy, but enjoyable body.  The smoke is more dimensional though, gaining depth with hints of liquid smoke, toasted oak and campfire.

3088,"2006-03-15",3.7,"Bottle (12oz).  Shared with blankboy, his bottle.  Poured opaque black with a small dark brown head.  Nice, typical roast stout aroma - nutty, light coffee, slightly tart fruit notes - with some cola character, theres smoke here, but not much - not sweet, but not all that bitter either.  Tasted pretty much as it smelled, just more hop and tart fruit bitterness - average at most time spent on the tongue, and fairly minimal smoke character.  Mouthfeel quite smooth, lightly carbonated and astringent - simply just a nice classic stout (I really dont see why this counts as a ""smoked"" beer - the smoke is minimal)","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
3088,"2006-02-02",3.7,"Pours with a black body topped by a thin head with little lacing.  Its slightly sweet and roasty with a nice malt note and a little coffee and chocolate.  The flavor has an added smokiness.  Full bodied and smooth.","San Diego, California, USA","Vac"
3088,"2006-01-31",3.8,"Thanks Cquiroga!  Pours a very thick black color with a small dark tan head and no lasting lacing.  Aroma is acidic and fruity with a slightly roasted note to it.  Flavor is super smoky like eating a mouthful of hickory chips.  Its very smooth and had a big mouthful.  Im not traditionally a big fan of smoked beers, but the combinatin of the smokiness and the palate feel really made this an enjoyable beer.","San Diego, California, USA","zug4abby"
3088,"2006-01-22",4.4,"(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with Eyedrinkale, thanks Mike!) Been sitting on this one for almost a year, so its had some time to do its thing in the bottle.  Hardly a wimper when I pop the cap, and pouring the beer, whoa, this is black, black, black!  Looks like used motor oil, with a fairly thick viscosity.  The light brown head is about as dark a cap as Ive seen on a beer, but its extremely small, barely cover the beer with a full layer, and completely dissipates in under a minute.  But wow, its fully black even at the edges when held to a sunlight, so you cant get any darker and more opaque than this.  The piquant, intense nose projects a very earthy and roasty aroma, plenty of decaying wood, and strong hints of delicious, sweet, chocolate-coated cherries.  Not getting much in the way of smoke, however.  Some differences in the flavor though, with quite a bit more coffee showing up.  Its roasty and fairly bitter, earthy and mushroomy, only slightly sweet, plenty of that cherry and chocolate combination.  But again, smoke isnt really all that noticeable, and thats probably because the stout shows so much roastiness and ash that smoke wouldnt really add much.  Lightly carbonated, as one would assume given the nearly headless pour.  Full bodied, but not thick and heavy, so this makes it a pretty easy drinking beer for one that packs such rich and intense flavor.  Extremely flavorful enjoyable beer, one that drank pretty easy for me, and my now-empty glass provokes much sadness.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
3088,"2006-01-08",3.6,"Thanks to Styles for this beer.  Poured black with ruby highlites and a dark brown fizzy head that dissipated quickly.  Light aroma of cherries, bitter coffee, some fruity acidity.  Taste is light roasted coffee, a bit of funk, some mild fruit essences.  Medium slick oily body.  Whatever smokiness that was intended to show in the flavor profile seems to be assimilated into the trademark roastiness of stout, and is thus not especially noteworthy.  However it is still a pretty nice stout.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

3088,"2005-10-09",3.7,"Pours jet black. The head consisted of a brown haze and a few little bubbles that stuck to the edge of the glass, needless to say it was mostly diminishing. No lacing to speak of. Aroma is a mix of coffee and the smell your clothes get after sitting around a campfire all night. Taste is initially burnt espresso and dark chocolate, hops make their presence known somewhere in the middle. Flavor is smokey throughout. This brew should only be drank at about 55 degrees F. The flavor improves immensely. The chocolate and coffee become more pronounced as the beer warms. Just enough sweetness comes though to balance the smoke and char. Finish is very long and leaves you with a bit of an  ashy aftertaste. This beer is full bodied, syrupy and mouth coating.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"
3088,"2005-10-06",3.4,"Thanks to Secret Santa Crosling for this one!  Oily black pour, deep brown head barely broke the surface before dying off.  Restrained roasty and smoked aroma.  Flavor was initially deep roast, followed by an unrelenting attack of ash and char.  Bizarre sensation of having a layer of soot left in my mouth after having swallowed.  Interesting though.  Smoked?  How about burnt?  As it warmed, the ashiness gave way a bit to a more traditional dark roast profile with a faint hint of espresso and perhaps even some fruitiness.  Medium body.  Not a bad beer, despite what this description sounds like.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

Aroma is pretty expressive, with a nice balanced of peaty scotchy hints and chocolate, cocoa, caramel and coffee aromas.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin and initially the flavor is completely lacking in both the front-palate and the mid-palate, until the finish yields rich scotch flavors, light smoke, chocolate, caramel, light malt bitterness and light sourness.  I enjoyed the different segments together, but not as a whole.

While the aroma didnt knock you down like the Calumet smoked, it was very nice. Drank while eating some of mjames elk steak, it was a nice pair, and reminded me of a slightly sweet smoked pulled pork bbq.

3088,"2005-06-27",4.4,"Pours perfectly opaque, viscous and oily. Head is dark brown and lazy. However, the small bit that does reside around the edges leaves gorgeous mahogany lacing when the liquid is swirled in the snifter.  Smell is rich, of chocolate cookies, smoky leather, and a distinct almond and cream that it is unique for a stout. Really a fine smelling beer, like being tucked deep in a leather smokers chair.  Mouthfeel is richly smooth and oh so smoked. Pork barbecue, chipotle peppers and cigarettes, is what its like, but they all contribute without being gimmicky. Elegantly they mesh with the roasted chocolate malts and rich pit fruits. Its a boldy packed palate and it works extremely well for such a full load. The guys out West with their massive stouts ought to take notes.  Aftertaste is chocolate, fruit and some alcohol  strong, but unobtrusive.

3088,"2004-08-11",4.0,"Completely opaque black. Thick mocha head fringes the broken layer. Evenly displayed aroma of assorted berries, ink, soil, and rich espresso. Feeble smoke, prunes, charcoal, leafy hops, and phenols. Thick, oily body. Velvety enough. Bready, ink-drizzled malts soften the moderate acidity. Other than adding some grit to the body, smoke is hardly a factor. Tar and burnt malts inundate the palate but are held in check by the dark berry bedding. Sufficient vanilla, caramel, and a sprucey hop undertow soften the body and smoothen the delicious black malt astringency. Soft roast intermingles with the prune acidity and harsh earthy malt elements. Finishes dry, chalky, and burnt with suggestions of ink, rich espresso, bittersweet chocolate, and their signature black malt stamp. Perpetual burnt malt and vanilla remnants. Yet another DH beer with spectacular execution of roast and char integration. If theyd somehow do away with that yogurty acidity, which seemingly underlies every one of their stouts and detracts from the body and overall richness, and add more rauch malt to this one in particular, theyd have some true humdingers.

Body is extremely smooth, hints of light smoke and a touch of chocolate at the front.  A bittersweet middle is accented by light bitter citrus hop notes.  Finished lightly bitter and smooth.  I could handle a bit more smoke and a bunch more roast, but a well balanced smokey stout.","Fergus, Ontario, CANADA","daboskabouter"
3088,"2003-12-17",3.5,"smoky chocolate aroma, small thin head, sausagey smokiness then sweetness and finally like biting into a coffee bean, a nice array of flavors but not quite sure if they work together","Sisters, Oregon, USA","Zach Diesel"
3088,"2003-12-17",3.7,"Coffee, chocolate, highly smoked in the nose.  Black with a brown head thats tiny.   Big chocolate up front with lots of roast and coffee.   Intesely smokey but balanced by all the roast, coffee and chocolate.  I really enjoy this.","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","P-tor44"
3088,"2003-10-27",3.9,"Poured a crude oil like black with a medium sized deep dark brown head.  smoky roasted malt aroma. taste is of charcoaled malt, with some chocolate and roasted coffee notes, leading to a slightly bitter finish. mouthfeel  was suprisingly a bit on the thin side, given that this poured like syrup, but didn't really detract from the enjoyment of this fine brew.","Kentwood, Michigan, USA","bubslang"
3088,"2003-08-08",3.7,"Dark, thick and smoked beyond doubt. This burnt roasted beverage has an interesting wang like its been marinated in ""liquid smoke"". Head is substantial. Certainly not lacking in flavor.","Salem, Missouri, USA","humulus"
3088,"2003-07-27",3.5,"Pours like molasses or petroleum with a brown head.  Aroma is roasted malts, and the flavor is likewise heavy on roasted, burnt, smoked notes, with a hint of sweetness.  The body was a bit on the thin side.  The brewer's other stouts (and Black Bier porter) have the same smoked flavor as this beer does.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
3088,"2003-03-06",4.3,"This is the first smoked ale beer that I can truly appreciate.  This poured with the darkest head I have ever seen.  The aroma is dominated by its smoked tones, smells like malt sweetness intermingled with clothes worn around a campfire.  The flavor begins like a normal stout, roasted, bitter, but it ends with a smoked twang.  This is a remarkably balanced beer and well worth trying.  Excellent paired with grilled salmon.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Inveigler"
3088,"2003-02-24",4.0,"Poured a jet black with a small dark brown head.A smoky malt aroma. Roasted coffee, chocolate and black malt taste. A nice hop bitterness and a slighty smokey flavor. An impressive brew.","FLINT, Michigan, USA","pauliefrog99"
3088,"2003-01-02",4.1,"Opaque with a thick, foamy, burnt powdered cocoa head. Slowly streaming carbonation. Burnt coffee, burnt chocolate and burnt black malt aroma with hints of dry barley. Soft, thick and lightly fizzy. Not smoked at all, but merely charred with loads of seared malt flavors and a bittersweet cocoa and coffee aftertaste. Very silky feel to it as it sits. Medium full body. Carbonation lessens. Long, brooding dark malts linger with an emphatic black malt harshness. Turns a little oily late with an emerging hop bitterness and burps. Finishes with a dominating black malt astringency and some hints of oat smoothness. Fairly high alcohol it seems as well. Very good.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"
3088,"2002-12-28",4.2,"Pours a thick jet black color, small bubbly brown head, smokey roasty malt aroma. Sweet burnt flavors, slight smoke flavor in the mix, full creamy mouthfeel that explodes with roasted goodness, I love it, thanks PsychProf for another great one from this brewery.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MaxPower"
3088,"2002-12-27",3.3,"Ridiculously dark in color, with a wee dark head. Aroma is initially roasted malts and some hops, but shifts to whiffs of meaty smokiness.  Malt flavor as well starts with chocolate/roast maltiness, and then a waave of smoke hijacks the malt flavor and finishes quickly.  Smoke flavor is most pronounced initially, then goes away until almost the end, when is pops its head to sour the last 4 ounces.  The first 8 ounces of this beer were way more enjoyable than the last fore.  Sorry, awful pun.  Pretty interesting and the rating would end up higher if I could erase the last 3 or 4 sips from my memory.  Thanks to Psychprof for the surprise!","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
3088,"2002-12-16",3.8,"The fourth in the Dark Horse stout series - are these guys raising a flame to rival the folks in Kalamazoo?  In any event, I liked this stout and appreciated the subtleties of its smoked nature - definitely present in the aroma,  the smoke slipped elusively through various cracks left by the decent roasts and herbality in the flavour.   When I finally caught up with the little guy he proteus-shifted on me until I couldnt tell if it was good clean oakfire smoke or just the interesting edges of roasted barley I was getting.  I like the way you get a breif, creamier sensation in the mouth before the harder smoky and roasty edges set to work ... oh, and Michael, Im down with that impressive brown head note - Im a sucker for dark heads on stouts and this one was the darkest of my experience.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
3088,"2002-12-14",3.6,"Another solid effort from this Marshall, MI, brewery. Not as heavily smoked as other smoked beers I have had. A wonderfully dark brown head rises on this woodsy, hoppy, smoked malt brew. Medium-bodied. Would be a good introduction to smoked beers for someone who likes dark beers but is otherwise smoke-naive (kind of like me!).","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
