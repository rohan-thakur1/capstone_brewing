Lovely oxidized aroma. Its really nutty infused, a ton of sweet raisins, thick syrupy caramel sauce, Vanilla, hints of wood and Norwegian brown cheese thats been soaked in a little bit of chloride. The last part probably from rinsing the glass. Like what I smell. Oh, its his is good. Fudgy caramel and a lovely sherry sweetness. Theres a few bubbles that prickles on the tongue and its thick and syrupy in the mouth. Warming, dry licorice, Vanilla, apples and sweet concentrate of oranges. Wow.

323,"2017-05-29",3.9,"Oct. 16. A 0.5 l bottle, vintage 2010. It poured a clear copper body with prominent, thicker legs. Sweetish dried fruit aroma, caramel, nuts, some alcohol and wood. Moderately sweet flavor, not too overwhelming although still cloying, malty with more dried and ripe fruits, sherry and then nuts mixing up with a strong wood barrel note. Light sourness popped in here and there. Full bodied of course with tingling sweetish and warming alcohol finish following the flavor. Not so extremely slow going as some from this series, but also complex although the barrel seemed to round it in expense of both sweetness and complexity. A good, serious stuff.","Split, CROATIA","heavy"

323,"2016-06-10",4.5,"From notes. Enjoyed this at Dougs house for a small gathering on May 01 with Travis, ebone1988, and I think Charlie made an appearance as well. Doug cracked this 750 mL bottle of 2010 out as a little bit of a break, and we all took a finger pour of it. Hot damn! The pour is a darker caramel colored golden brown with no head or carbonation. This thing looks delicious. The aroma is beautiful. There is a lot of toffee and butterscotch. The sweetness is really surprising. There is a nice oak to it as well as a maple and brown sugar sweetness. There is a little more booze than I would like, but thats about the only thing I could knock this one on. The flavor has a lot of dark fruits and a heavy caramel and sweet butterscotch. The oakiness is good, and there is a little booze once again. The vanilla opens up a touch, and a maple sweetness and soft woodiness really shine through. The mouth feel is thick and chewy, even without any carbonation. The aftertaste is all sweet butterscotch, light fruits, and booze. Its excellent. I wasnt expecting this one at all.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

There is no trace of bitterness or carbonation - or the alcohol, which is quite impressive. Overall, this beer is highly vinous and very tasty, but besides the sweetness it is also relative mild and not very complex.

Powerful toffee, caramel and raisin but with a good deal of dryness coming from nutty barrel tannin, light vanilla, warming alcohol and a more dry, nutty, sherry-like note that must be the oxidation.

323,"2015-11-22",4.2,"Vintage bottle of three years of age. Classy (and expensive) bottle, I must say... Absolutely no head at all, deep and warm, beautiful copper colour, looks like a glass of orange liqueur or something alike. Strong aroma carried upwards by the alcohol, very liqueurish and rather unbeery, with impressions of sweet sherry, marmelade, brown rhum, white port, candied banana, some oaky tannins (vanilla), amaretto, honey, wet wood... Very sweet flavour, candyish even and notably liqueurish, honeyish as well, candied oranges and dito cherries, marzipan, almost cloying even; expectedly very vinous, oily mouthfeel, supple, sweet caramelly malts but covered in this much candied sweetness and alcohol, it feels more like some beer liqueur than a traditional barley wine; I even get a flash of Samuel Adams Utopias in some respects. Warming but gentle and well-functioning alcohol and a hint of drying woodiness wraps things up in the finish, but the liqueurish and honeyish sweetness lasts for a long time after that. Very interesting, classy barley wine, clearly made with great care and skill. Perhaps a bit too sweet to enjoy by itself: I think a beer like this best serves its purpose in a gastronomical context, as a dégustif after a rich meal, paired with blue cheese to counter the sweetness. If you look at this in that specific context, I must admit that this is extremely well done and I can easily see how many people here rate this as the best beer Italy has to offer.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

323,"2014-07-18",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Luscious raisins, prunes and caramel are enveloped by brandy-rum-port-like allusions, as alcohol and wood blow heat throughout the flavour profile.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-There is no head of foam atop the dark brown.
-The aroma is powerful, a bit rough on the barrel notes perhaps as well.
-Could this one not be oxidized as Terre? Or is it that the barrel presence is stronger and thus hiding some of the oxidation?
-Its a little too hot for my liking.
-The lack of carbonation works well with this type of super malty sipper.
-Caramelized oranges are found in the nose.

323,"2013-08-28",2.3,"In short: A lifeless uber-sweet and uber-boozy brown ""beer"".
How: From a bottle at Mondial de la Bière 2013.
The look: Clear rudty-brown body with no head.
In long: Nose is toasted caramelized pastry, lots of alcohol fumes, wood. A scary sweet and boozy aroma that is a prelude of things to come. In mouth the beer is sticky, syrupy, oily, lifeless. almost no carbonation. Taste is cloying, uber-sweet toffee, a shot of hard-liquor (like cheap rum), cardboard-like oxidation, some wood. I enjoy a big sipper as much as the next guy, Ive drank multiple bottles of the monstrously sweet Dark Lord, but this Baladin Xyauyù Barrel was just wrong, I didnt even finish my 4oz sample. Expensive and totally overrated, and I hate when I express my against-the-grain opinion about a beer and people say I have a superiority complex, screw you people, Im laughing at you, and Im laughing at you better than anybody has ever laughed at you.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

323,"2012-10-09",4.8,"# 1450 Rating. I finally got to try one of these @ Quintessence 2012. A wonderful closer after a long list of stellar sours, this went perfectly paired with some chocolate caviar - this was highly impressive stuff. Got a cognac sized pour of this one - Italian wine / beer styled bottle in a cardboard tube similar to those that whiskeys use. Fine presentation going on here - bottle specifies as well as one of brewery gentlemen that this aged on Rum barrels. Looks like brandy when poured, obviously this pours completely flat, zero head formation, a dark copper amber. Smell is sweet, like some liquor, sweet caramel, rum, wood, vanilla, dark fruits completely ingrained into the previous, light booze. Slick, oily, liqueur, with caramel, toffee mixed in, barrel, brown sugar, wood, vanilla, dark fruits, rum, the sweetness hides the alcohol - plus given the small pour, you take little sips of this stuff. Incredibly - like some kind of really fine liqueur - this something totally different. I liked the Terre actually even a bit more.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
323,"2012-10-07",4.7,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2012 Bottle sample @ Cantillon Quintessence 2012.
Que dire de cette bière et/ou liqueur? du grandiose et facilement une bière qui note très haut sur ma liste.
Couleur cuivrée, pas de col laissant un filament doré/huileux sur le verre.
Arôme est profond surtout au niveau caramel/buttery avec des notes de fruits fermentés laissant passer toute leur douceur. Pointe de grillé et café sur une touche vanillée. Le tout forme un bouquet unique où les ingrédients ont leurs places sans surcharger les narines. Le rhum est là discret et en retrait mais procure une effluve fraiche dalcool qui donne aussi les notes de la barrique.


Palais est immense. Sur les conseils du braseur qui explique que la bière a été oxydée intentionnellement, javais qcq craintes, et la surprise fut de taille. Profile butterscotch, douce et sucrée sans être dans le surfait, le rum est subtile et contribue a de dines notes boisées mais aussi de pomme caramélisée très légère. Le tout est visqueux en bouche avec un malt agréable laissant une pointe de noisette, de grillé. Le tout est onctueux se buvant comme une liqueur. Laccompagnement avec le chocolat était bien calculé.
