600,"2013-10-01",3.1,"Sampled at Sakaya NYC. A very dignified little plastic cup. Clear & still.

Online notes seem to be contradicting, but I think I got the jist from the rep. Breath. Using 80+yr old cedar trees, only the richest planks near the core, aged for a very short duration in comparison to other spirits(only weeks apparently), & the barrels are only used up to three times before being discarded. Exhale.

Nose is sharp with green wood & lacquer. A little hot.

Taste is a lot of barrel, bitter bark & cherry pit. the cedar comes off nearly like varnish-notes in a cheaper whiskey. Sleek body. Long, lightly acidic, biting finish.

Could be better, but it was unique enough to stand out at the tasting.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"

600,"2009-11-19",3.4,"300 ml bottle. Aroma of cedar, with retronasal alcohol and rice. Rather simple, dominated by cedar. Woody, citrus, flavor, sweet, lightly milky and fruity, with cherries or strawberries, and cedar. Smooth palate, rather full body. Decent stuff, the cedar is dominant, but the sake works with it well.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
