345,"2016-11-11",4.5,"Bottle shared at kermis. Thanks very much! Clear golden to dark golden with thin white head. Sweet and sour grapes, grapestones, nutmeg, hay, horse, funk, little metallic (mostly in the smell). Some sensual sweaty armpit, unwashed hair, cobwebs, sucking really hard on a mouthful of grapestones, densely compressed grapeskin, licking limeskin and a cold beercan. Medium sweet and over medium sour, light grassy bitter and slightly minerallike salty. Medium body, soft carbonation. Super fruity and grapey tart finish. Super.","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","sjogro"
345,"2016-11-11",4.5,"2014/2015 bottle massive thanks to kermis! Slight hazy golden with short lasting off white head. Massive funk, some hay, lemon, cobwebs, dry cellar notes. Theres quite some fruit as well with apricot and peach. Very impressed by the deep funk here, without being dusty at all. Obviously some old lambics in here. Light sweet and medium sour. Medium bodied with light fizzy carbonation. Very very good.","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","Maakun"
345,"2016-10-28",4.4,"Bottle, 14-15 vintage, thanks to KBHess, drunk 10/8/16.Good amount of white head tops a pale golden body, high clarity, with light brass tints. Good retention for the style.Bright acidity provides ""dry"" tangerine-peach-like notes in the nose. Big brett and lactic character, with just the right touch of acetic acid. Maybe some wood in there, as well, but its light. Very elegant, airy, floral brett provides surprisingly delicate, almost Belgian ale-like qualities in conjunction with the light wheat and malt behind it. No alcohol or flaw.Opening up the flavor, there is a strong lactic presence cut by fruitiness in the form of lime and nectarine. Band aid-like brett with touches of dried hay and very light horseblanket enter in the mix. Soft, malty texture shows balancing sweetness in near-perfect proportion which adds a honey-vanilla element. Perfect, tight, champagne-like carbonation and lingering delicate brett notes. Very unique and very, very nice, sublime stuff.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

345,"2015-12-21",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2017 Thank you! Sampled 750 ml. bottle @ Kerstbierfestival Essen 2015. Rather hazy for the style. Nose & tastes are a bit obscured by sediment but otherwise it is almost akin to a yeastier 3F with maybe some Oud Beersel or Girardin, guessing is easy since it includes pretty much every lambiek available  Otherwise yeasty, great funk, pepper, mild horse blanket, ritually no sourness, barnyard, nicely dry, mild oka. Very nice beer, a bit less haziness / sediment and it would have shined even more. Lovely beer. + not on RB. Hof Ten Dormaal / h.ertie Hof ten Dormaal Oak Aged -> 750 ml. bottle sampled @ Meug 2017. Collaboration between Uli & Hof ten Dormaal. If I remember correctly, Hof ten Dormaal Bruin aged on a wine barrel with lambiek added, Lindemans & Girardin but I Uli wasnt too sure anymore. Interestingly it poors deep hazy orange with off-white head. Nose is all lovely lambiek funk, sparkling, rustic farm, barn, great lambiek funk, rich, pepper, barn, faint barrel, getting some 3F vibe here. Tastes like a fine geuze, dry crisp, Champagne sparkling, mellow wine, wine acidity in the back, touch more wine than your usual geuze, great barn, oak, rustic lambiek, funk. Hof ten Dormaal beers to have been completely eaten up by the wild yeast. Very nice sparkling funky dry geuze with big wine notes.  (4.7/5)","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
345,"2015-12-21",3.9,"Sampled @ Kerstbierfestival Essen 2015. Clear yellow to light orange color, small white head. Aroma is sourish, apricot, barnyard, hayish. Taste brett, tart, some grapepeel, balanced sourness and pretty dry. Quite like it actually.","Oirschot, THE NETHERLANDS, NETHERLANDS","Benzai"
