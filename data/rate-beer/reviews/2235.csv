2235,"2010-09-05",3.0,"Bottle from Malt & Vine. Pours very light amber with a foamy beige head. Medium body with foamy carbonation. Flavor is lightly toasted caramel with some balancing grassy hop. Fairly clean. Drinks well. The finish is more caramel than not. But the hop does hold it off.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
2235,"2010-02-12",3.4,"Bottle.  Orange amber pour with a thin white head on it.  Left some spidery lacing.  Light malty aroma to this, with some brown sugar, bread, and a bit of grass.  Flavor is toasty and bready malt, light caramelly sweetness, hay, floweriness, and a spice and herb bitterness to the finish.  Theres a slight vegetal DMS presence, but its acceptably minimal and hard to notice amongst this beers good traits.  Has a hint of sweet orange flavor once it warms a touch.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Nena"
2235,"2010-01-02",3.2,"Bottle: &nbsp Dirty golden, hazy, large frothy white head, thick lacing. &nbsp A little lighter and less Amber in color than most. &nbsp But still looks inviting. &nbsp Reminds me more of a Triple. &nbsp Soft mealy based malty 

nose, subtle grass or hay. &nbsp Mealy on the tongue, certainly malty, pale, a little bit of straw. &nbsp Towards the end it does pick up a little bit of a chemical astringency, very minor tho. &nbsp Not have bad overall. &nbsp Body and 

mouthfeel are moderate. &nbsp Malty finish. &nbsp Better than many German examples I have had. &nbsp Only some minor things that I would tweak, but other than that, one of the better Aldergrove I have had in a while.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
2235,"2009-11-02",3.2,"Caramel amber colored with poofy, off-white head. Smells of toasty pilsen malt redolent of Munich Oktoberfests past lift through the nostrils and into the soul. Easy nutty body, wisps of caramel and accented by Munich and Vienna Malts. Doughy. Hops provide balance, but dont stand out. A hint of spice and citrus. Bitter-sour pilsen finish.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"

2235,"2008-07-17",3.8,"Bottle: Pours a copper bronze color with a nice sticky white head and clean sheets of lacing. The nose is sweet and floral, light toasted pumpkin seed and a grassy juniper and hop note with some peach, maybe some glue. The flavor is...I would put the mouthfeel first. A fizzy/fuzzy creaminess that makes each drink feel like a little fun snap on the tongue.  The flavor is sweet and bready with some light fruit and continued doughiness. Finishes light and refreshing with a hint of fruit and spice. Nice oktoberfest.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"

Aroma of caramel malt, some light pear, sweet sugar cookie dough and a touch of roasted nuts. Taste is smooth, creamy, medium bodied, with flavors of light caramel malt, some apple/pear fuit, flowery hops and a touch of cotton candy.

Pours a dark rich amber with a lovely fluffy white head. Toasty malt aroma; I like the previous raters description of ""honeysuckle."" 
This one shines in flavor.  Toasty malt, honey-roasted nuts, some nice summer field-grass, just a nice mellow hop twist on the close like a hint of orange peel, a hint of spice. Maybe just a touch too much brown sugar, but still splendidly drinkable, Im really really impressed. Right on!","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
