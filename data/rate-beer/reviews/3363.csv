3363,"2016-09-12",3.7,"Pours an entirely hazed orange-golden pulp color with a medium sized, bubbly head.

Smells of a flower accompanied fruit blend consisting of fresh squeezed lemon, ripe orange and a hint of juicy mango. Has a herbal undertone with wet grass and a hint of cakey sweet malts.

Offers a higher carbonation, while the beers mouthfeel remains soft, with light, refreshing, yet hoppy taste.

Tastes of a mineralic aqueous beginning with dry lemon peel, unripe oranges and sweeter malts. More lemon becoms apparent during the mid palate with an utmost light and refreshing, dry finish. 

Borderline watery due to its light body, while establishing a crisp and dry hop profile, which keeps the palate entertained.","GERMANY","aleigator"

3363,"2016-07-17",4.2,"2015 BJCP Category: 21B Specialty IPA: Session IPA
AROMA: Pineapple, grapefruit peel, faint garlic/onion in the background. 10/12APPEARANCE: Pale banana yellow; murky body though no sediment. Large, off-white, soapy foam mostly dissipates. 2/3FLAVOR: A melange of citrus, tropical fruits and earthy spices. Grapefruit is prominent, but more of a peel than a juicy taste. Some pineapple flavor throughout. Strong dry spicy sensation (rye/garlic bread) probably due to Kolsch yeast. Not much distinctive malt character, though enough to offer a modicum of balance. 17/20MOUTHFEEL: Plenty of body for only 4.2%. Light/medium intensity; texture is smooth. CO2 low/medium - not quite crisp, but not paper thin either. Highly quaffable, refreshing, and sessionable. Lingering spicy aftertaste. 4/5OVERALL IMPRESSION: Essentially a New England-style IPA as a session IPA. Works well as both.

3363,"2015-11-16",2.6,"Pours a very hazy and bright golden banana yellow color with a half finger white head that immediately settles into a thin ring. Minimal spotty lacing left behind. Looks more like a Berliner than a pale ale and the lack of retention/lacing hurts the appearance. 

Subtle floral hop aroma with faint zesty spice and a pale malt backbone. A touch or citrus along with grass and pine needle followed by biscuit, bread and some light fruit. 

Medium body wih tight carbonation and a crisp, spicy hop bite that lingers over the pale malts into a dry finish. Bitter and spicy with grassy hops and pine needle along with pepper and corianders. This is countered by a pale malt backbone with hints of bread yeast, biscuit and light fruit. Kind of tame and flavors seem a bit off to me.

AKA a good beer to drink while youre floating down a lazy river pissing on yourself.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Can: The aroma consists of citrus, lemon/lemon peel, light dank notes, and a touch of tropical fruits.

The finish has light-moderate grapefruit and light lemon. Its light bodied with light-moderate carbonation.

Aroma was a very pleasant shot of grapefruit hop. Flavor was pale malt with a really nice grapefruit hop finish.

3363,"2014-07-16",4.3,"Now this is really something! A session IPA that kills a lot of IIPA in terms of hop aroma, flavor and bitterness. This is the kind of beer I can really get behind. It is a very cloudy yellow orange w/ a small white head and the appearance is about the only unremarkable thing about it. It has this just huge orange and grapefruit character from the nose to the citrus rind bitterness in the finish. There is some pineapple and other tropical fruit floating around in there as well but this is all about a huge expression of hops. There is just a touch of malt but this is very dry. It has a medium to full body and moderate carbonation--very juicy, almost hefeweizen-like in terms of texture, which works wonderfully.

Whitish head is bubbly, dissipates to a small layer that laces ok. Bigger bubbles with gentle ruby red tinge in the body. Aromas offer a potent rich graprfruit juice and fruit bent. Lemons and gentle melon meet bready malts, grain, and floral bitter hops. Potent grapefruit life leads the charge, bitter and a bit pithy. Initial is lighter end of the fold in body with good citrus rind and oils, bitter grapefruit is juicy and dry. Firmer florals pose some nice bitterness, gentle bready malts and crisp grain provide a slight bpody, something easy to throw back. Middle is a touch floral and fruity, gentle gumball and faint tropical fruit still kick with a gentle fuzzy carbonation and nice bitterness overall. Dry and bitter backend, cleaner with lingering grapefruit, lemon and floral hops.

3363,"2013-12-18",4.1,"12/18/12. 16oz can with big thanks to MaxxDaddy! Homeboy hooks it up again! The look of this, in a glass, can depend on how you pour. There are definitely some floaties/gunk at the bottom, so at first pour, its a lightly hazed orange pour with a nice khaki head that sticks around and laces well. If you dump the bottom of the can in, it gets a lot more hazy. That doesnt bother me one bit, but if its not your thing, pour carefully, or shut up and drink it from the can like a real man. Anyway, theres great hop character in the aroma - fresh, floral, and fruity, tropical and white fruits, touches of citrus and bubblegum. Light mouthfeel, good carbonation, but enough body to make you look at the ABV again. They managed to strike a good balance of a light, refreshing aspect while leaving enough body to let you know this is good shit. Great flavor as well, more fresh, hoppy character - floral, tropical fruits, a bit of an onion aspect, lingers lightly bitter, just enough doughy pale malts to balance the hop but keep it light and refreshing.

Notes of citrus hops, caramel and german malts, lemon kolsch notes, grapefruit, vanilla, cheese funk, and lightly bitter grains. So refreshing and juicy for the low alcohol. Best beer I have had from them and easily in my top 5 session ipas over the last year. Always fresh and juicy as fuck with a beautiful super hoppy kolsch taste. ""If it aint boat, fix it"" new batches are white peach pussy lager juice. Clean as fuck with just the right amount of hops and drink ability. Been my go to beer for the last few years due to consistency and self distributed freshness. Much respect.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3363,"2012-07-14",3.3,"Growler thanks to the maxxxxxdaddy. Clear light yellow pour with small white head. Aroma has notes of cooked banana and pine. Really mellow but balanced notes of lemon rind, bitter grapefruit, and pine. I wasnt crazy about the aroma, but the mild and balanced flavor really hit the spot.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","italarican"
3363,"2012-07-03",3.4,"Growler from Whole Foods.  Pale pour with a fine, foamy lid.  The aroma is a little rough and yeasty.  The flavor is very good though - like a strong pilsner with some piney hop notes, an APA/pilsener blend.","USA","Slipstream"
3363,"2012-06-29",2.0,"I tasted a more grassy flavor than I did the grapefruit. This beer was exactly as advertised; good to drink if stranded on a boat, but not good enough to drink once on dry land.","New York, New York, USA","GL2814"
3363,"2012-06-27",4.8,"Cloudy, just darker than lemonade.  Citrus nose, suggesting the great taste to come.  Paradoxically,this beer is light and mouthfilling at the same time.  
This is a very refreshing brew, glad I stopped in at Bistro 55 for NJ Craft Beer Day!","Nanuet, New York, USA","hunter112"

3363,"2012-05-31",3.5,"On tap at Pony with Andy, James, Streets & Annie. Hazy lemonade pour into shaker. Tame but wheaty aroma, similar sort of flavor but a touch of lemongrass and zest. Light mouthfeel, medium carb. Not sure why its called Boat Beer but I could picture myself enjoying this while sitting on a fishing boat enjoying a sunny summer afternoon, but that would require my getting out of ops so lets just say its a very decent beer and call it a day.","New York, New York, USA","hivemind"
3363,"2012-05-31",4.9,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2016 Draft at pony/torst/Gingerman with Andrew, Dallas and Street. Pours a mighty hazy pale golden body with nice modest, white lacing. Aroma is super light funk, fresh cut grass, light vanilla and muted cream in the finish. Mouthfeel is light and super sessionable with notes of fresh, grassy hops, lemon, grapefruit, light grain and delicious fresh, citrus fruits. This is incredible, and may be the best session beer ever crafted.  The juice is loose when this one is flawless - which is often.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"

Taste is resinous bitter grapefruit and pine. Malt is mild and a touch grainy with a straw husk taste. Overall dry, bitter and refreshing. Easy drinking beer with a heathy bitter bite. A tasty offering that I can enjoy a couple pints of and continue through the day.","New Jersey, USA","fbm115"
3363,"2012-02-12",3.4,"The best session beer I have ever tasted.  In spite of the relatively low alcohol content, there is tremendous body and flavor.  Nicely hopped against what must have been a relatively light malt bill.","Bloomfield, New Jersey, USA","dogfishho"

Aroma has a good hop prescence, citrus rind, copper and for some reason a hint of vanilla. The body is nice with a medium mouth feel, average to strong carbonation but hardly any aftertaste. Flavor is quick fading crisp citrusy hops and light toast. Great stuff for only 4.2%.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
