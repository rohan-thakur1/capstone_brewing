Palate: initially dry, then sweet pears, dry sours coming up, light tart, no carbonation. Overall: fantastic Perry, not too sweet, subtle, very pleasant.

1057,"2015-11-14",4.0,"From the plastic barrel at Middle Farm. It pours clear pale green - gold with no head. The nose is fresh, bitter-sweet, juicy pear, earthy, barnyard funk and some fruity tang. The taste is so juicy upfront, sweet-sour, tart pear, some acidity, earth, light funk, pear skin, dried leaves, salted lemon vibe, wood with a dry, lingering juicy pear finish. Medium body and fine carbonation. Excellent balance. Good depth, yet remains very drinkable. One of the best perrys I have had to date.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
1057,"2012-11-01",3.9,"Tap at Cider Tap with Sarah. Pours a hazy pale gold with no head whatsoever. Aroma has a nice tart pear note with a nice underlying leaves and light funk note. Flavor starts with sweet pears with light spice that is joined by a nice light acid.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
1057,"2011-06-02",3.0,"Cask at Southampton Arms, London. A light yellow perry with a slight haze. The aroma is of fresh pears. The flavor is sweet with strong notes of pears, but also with a slight acidity, that tickles the palate a bit, but generally on the sweet side. The finish is slightly tart.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
1057,"2011-04-04",3.2,"Cask (gravity) @ GBBF 2010, Great British Beer Festival, Earls Court Exhibition Centre, London, England.Light light unclear light matt grey yellow color with a fizzy - virtually none, white head.

1057,"2010-11-24",3.9,"Cask, Jolly Butchers. My first Perry rate....Wow, this was certainly an assault on the senses. Hazy lemon squash like looks with no head.  Aroma was big on vinegar and of course the anticiapted pear, with something weird lurking, maybe that glue in a pot you used to get when you were a kid ?! The flavour shattered any preconceptions about what its possible to create from a pear, and was an eye watering mixture of sweet and sour with some woody notes. Huge sourness in the finish. Quite an experience, and it seems like Ive embarked on my Perry rating with a good one.","Wirral, Merseyside, ENGLAND","wyzzywyz22"
1057,"2010-11-19",4.4,"Cask at Jolly Butchers. Pours dull, cloudy yellow with basically no head. Aroma hold faint pears, sweat, lots of vinegar, and must. Flavor has a quick, sweet beginning, then things get real. Very sour, with lots of vinegar, some tart fruit, faint funk, and a bit of salt. Its weird, and I love it. Light to medium in body with sharp, tingly carbonation. The finish does have some fruity sweetness but it is mostly about the sourness. Absolutely lip-puckering, eye-squinting sour. Once I swallow the liquid I can get a lot more of the perry character, but while drinking this stuff my mouth and throat are all a flutter. Fantastic.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
1057,"2010-11-18",4.3,"A Mes rate. Cask at the Jolly Butchers.Murky lemon yellow. About as perry looking as a perry can be. Strange snout. Massive pears for sure but there is something odd I can put my finger on. It smells a little like ladies stockings. Hmm, well that explains why its really inviting then. Theres a slight musky mead-like character too. Yup Im liking this so far. Crikey. Thats a real smack in the chops. Amazing tart pear flavour. Really good wood and lemony acidity with some intense but never overpowering sweet notes. This is full on stuff. Amazingly juicy. It storms around the palate bagging a wooden spoon on a saucepan and demanding to be attended to. The finish is truly epic. Amazing length. Christ on a bike. This is a big one. I dont want it to finish. Luckily it seems like its not going to. Each sip just adds to the intensity of what is already in the mouth. Bloody brilliant perry.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

1057,"2007-07-22",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2008 Bottle from garden centre, near Wellington, Herefordshire Poured light golden, nice peary nose but also a bit wine like in character. Wonderfully juicy and given a little time in the mouth this really had quite a good depth of flavour. Not as good as the Rathays which was a stunner but very nice all the same.   Polypin at Banbury Beer Festival 09-05-08   Cloudy lemon colour looks like Robinsons barley water. Very slightly sour nose but with some overipe pears. The taste is just superb, this i sweet admiitedly but those pears just feel like that oozing ripeness and oh bugger it this is one you just have to drink and forget about words, I loved it, little tangy bite back at the end, my beer/cider/perry of the fetival and this has now been updated to a  4.1","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"
