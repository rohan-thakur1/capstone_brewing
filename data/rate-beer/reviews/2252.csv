2252,"2015-02-26",2.2,"25cl bottle bb¿11/15?, merci Calisky. Brackish fizzy yellow pour. Smells like half a can of Red Bull poured over a mouldy apple cake: both candy sugar and artificial sweetener (saccharin, sucralose?) cover and ruin the lovely natural funky fruit sourness that anyone who tries De Trochs Oude Lambiek from rare source knows is there. Moulding peaches and brackish cider join the sugar party (20% of the bottle) in taste, whilst stale citric lemonade surfaces to whip up fizzy acid bubbles against the roof of the mouth, all insiduously conjuring up gastric ebullience like a Bailey&Tonic icecube timeclock. - Quite unbalanced, working with a quality base lambiek and hence tragically telling of the conflict of (commercial vs restorative) interests this brewery subsists on/against.

Carbonation is almost non-existent, with a flat body. Overall, balanced between sweet and sour pretty well, with no cloying sweetness as usual with the other Chapeau fruit ""lambics"".

The beer is mostly clear and see-through, with small chunks of sediment wandering aimlessly throughout the beer. The color is a light orange sunburst. The beer has a small head that leaves just a touch of lacing on the glass. The aroma is sweet and fruity, like a fruit juice. The beer tastes very sweet, though I suppose this was the intention. Personally, I cant fathom why one would take a sour beer and intentionally make it sweeter. To each their own. Surprisingly, the sweetness is not as cloying as I predicted. The body is medium-thin with a low level of carbonation. It was a fun experience, but I much prefer the traditional lambics over faros. From an objective standpoint, this was a pretty good beer.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

Since its a Chapeau, your expectations arent all that high coming in.  Since they produced a drinkable starter gueuze they do have the ability to make a decent lambic.  Theiri faro is fine, not in the upper echelon for sure but a good mid range faro.

This one looks better. It pours with a bigger head that is also slightly darker. It recedes in odd intervals leaving no lacing. The beer is a bit browner and hazier than the Lindemans with hues of magenta when light-struck.

The smel is quirky it definitely has a funk to it, though not the funk I usually associated with this beer. It has a must to it, maybe some brie cheese, also definitely some major oak in the scent, it also smells very sugary.

The taste is super sugary, with some rotten fruit taste, a hint of sourness (but way over powered by sweetness).

2252,"2010-07-25",2.7,"Best By July 2011; Sampled July 2010
A full pour summons forth a fingers worth of, dark tan colored head that dissapears fairly quickly.  The beer is quite dark colored, even for a Faro, with a concentrated amber hue.  It shows a brilliantly clear, dark amber hue when held up to the light.  The aroma smells oppressively sweet and of oxidized fruit.  There are some dark, oxidized caramel aromatics here as well (almost cola like some how) as well as some sweet-cherry like aromas, perhaps some raisin like notes and even a touch of lactic tartness that is just noticeable towards the finish.  This definitely smells over-poweringly sweet.

Very sweet tasting, the finish reminds me of cola and sweet tea, both accentuated by a light lactic acidity.  This is nice and light up front, though there is enough sugar here to make it stick to the palate; it is not like malt though that really clings to the mouth.  This tastes like sweet tea flavored with fake lemon and oxidized apples.  Other than the hint of lactic character, you would be hard pressed to know there was Lambic here.

The aroma on this one is definitely a bit objectionable because of the excessive sweetness, the flavor isnt quite as bad, but it is not something I really want to try again.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2252,"2009-06-09",3.1,"Bottle. An odd dark amber/brownish color with a fairly good sized tan head and rather good lacing, actually. Aroma dominated by funk, along with bread, sour cherries, and a hint of sugar. Flavor - damn, is this a ridiuculously sweetened lambic. Starts with sugar, leads into a little cherry- or apple-like fruitiness, and finishes with sugar. I swear Im nearly able to feel the sugar granules go down at the end. Its... not awful. Its no lambic, either. I can see what they were going for in this - an easily drinkable ""beer."" Its just that it doesnt have enough beeriness, enough sourness, enough funk, or enough of anything else to match the near-cloying sweetness of the sugar. Still, though, I know some friends who would love this one - non-beer drinkers, all of them.","Houston, Texas, USA","jumpjet2k"

2252,"2009-05-16",2.0,"Bottle shared with matt7215 at his place, thanks Matt, and thanks Cheesman for hooking up some lambic-starved Ontarians with some awesome beers. Too bad this particular lamic kind of sucked. Pours a murky burgundy with a tiny beige head. Not very nice to look at, and the aroma is even worse. Excessive syrup, cane sugar, candi sugar, residual sugar, and just plain regular unnecessary SUGAR. Some dry funk that is not at all as interesting as funk Ive experienced in other lambics. The flavour is barely passable as a consumable substance. Ronchy funk sourness (very minor) follows rich, near cloying sweetness, totally indistinct and not enjoyable. Gets worse with every sip. Still, glad to have tried such an obscure and semi-unnecssary style. I cant imagine the though-process that went into the invention of this style, ""Hey, lambics are awesome!

Thanks to bu11zeye for shipping me this recently.  After the last faro I wanted to revisit the style at some point to see if it was a stylistic problem or just an issue with that particular bottle.  As it turns out this one was several times better.  I don’t know that I would drink these all the time if they were readily available; what I do know is that they may one of the most underrated styles on the site.  If you get a chance to try this relatively fresh snap it up.

Aroma / Appearance - The cloudy rust colored body contained molasses, brown sugar, and oak funk.  Less like a lambic it reminds me of a sour brown.  Whatever you call it is inviting and fabulous.

Flavor / Palate - After a tart beginning the taste of chocolate, banana bread and cherries blends into a sweet mixture.  Much easier to drink than its more sour siblings this is a refreshing and different experience.  If more were available at a reasonable price I would buy them.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Sure its sweet, but that dont make it bad! Its got tartness that points toward vinegar, that distinct brown sugar component, edges of tart/sour fruit, all sorts of stuff!

Wow, that is weird.  The rock candy sweetness is very evident, but it is not melded in with the other flavors.  It just seems to be oddly paired.  Vinegar, soured fruit juice, and hints of the horse blanket must and moldy hay from the lambic.  This is all but undrinkable.

There is also a lashing of something sweet that reminds me of a lolly Ive eaten some time in the past. A fairly smooth flavour, slightly on the sweet side of a good balance. A nice sour lead off on tasting that is soon couteracted by a sugary rush. Its really sweet (which is expected), but its not at all cloying. Easily drinkable, and also strangely enjoyable.

2252,"2006-12-07",2.5,"Well, I wondered what a Faro was and now I know: its a lambic for beginners and the sweet-toothed. It has training wheels in the form of a heap of sugar to take the edge off the sour, funky flavours that make lambics so beguiling. This wasnt awful but I cant help wondering how much better it would be without the ""20% sugar candy"" listed in the ingredients. It was a cloudy caramel colour with a short cappuccino froth. The aroma was dominated by the barrel aging - like fresh-cut turpentine logs. It smelled like a much stronger beer, sherbet sour-sweet and alcoholic with an intriguing mint humbug note. NIce soft mouthfeel with a slight spritz in the swallow. The first sip offers a lovely lemon-sour, woody note before a big wash of sugary sweetness. Geez - this is a sugar bomb. There is a minty mouthwash effect to the finish and some classic lambic sourness but the sugar smothers everything. Nothing against the style - I can see a lot of potential here if the sugar was more restrained. Makes me wonder what the Cantillon and 3 Fronteinen are like.

Flavor is rather odd, lots of green apple tartness but then a sickeningly sweet burst of sugar attacks the tongue.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate fine bubbled carbonation.

Plenty, but not exceedingly so, of off-white head is very well-retained atop a clear copper-amber-pale-gold body, with light lacing and initial vigorous carbonation visible.  Aroma of wood pulp, dirt, sandalwood, wet sawdust, cider vinegar, old musty yeast and maybe a touch of vanilla.  Little to no wild yeast, though I have little experience identifying Belgian beers of this age, and I also have no idea the percent of lambic in this.  The flavor is musty, woody and quite cidery, and of course, sugary.  Simple table sugar, or light corn syrup-like in flavor, but actually, not horribly done.  Of course I would prefer it to not be there, as it bullys the other flavors, but its not quite cloying and not syrupy.  Light oak notes are most evident aside from the sugar, while some light acids gather on the finish.  If there is brett here, its very hard to distinguish amongst the sugar/oak flavor.  Finish is lightly tart, just faintly so, with more sugar and a strange, almost vegetal note present, perhaps wet sawdust again.  Mouthfeel is not oxidized that much, nor very thinned out.  Plenty of carbonation, though low and soft, is still apparent, with a wet, slippery sort of feel.  Hmm, I need to learn more about these.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2252,"2004-01-20",3.1,"Bottle at The Dovetail, Farringdon, London. Light bronze colour. Very sweet aroma, and  a sugary, Coca-Cola type taste. Smooth in the mouth, with some cherry and some raspberry. Very sweet stuff, with no development in flavour.","Birmingham (via Leicester), West Midlands, ENGLAND","DanielBrown"

2252,"2003-09-09",2.2,"Orange color. Sugary aroma, cinnamon, speculaas (sweet Dutch cookie with a cinnamon flavor). Very sweet and syrupy with only a hint of sourness. Cinnamon and grapes.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
2252,"2003-07-31",3.0,"Sampled alongside Lindeman's Faro. The front label had 3.5% abv, but the back label had 4.75%. Chapeau's label is green & brown with a picture of a beer barrel draped with hops and barley - Lindeman's is much more attractive: all black with stylish art deco white lettering. On opening the Lindeman's had more fizz and an immediate strong plummy aroma. Both settle to a brown copper colour with a fringe of bubbly froth - the Lindeman's bubbles slightly larger and more varied. So far the Lindeman's is ahead. On giving both a good sniff the Chapeau edges ahead with its musty sweet aroma, slightly medicinal, slightly licorice, quite perfumey - parma violets; when swirled extra sweetness rises. The Lindeman's has a slight plum aroma; when swirled some yeasty lambic acid rises. On tasting the Chapeau is the more interesting with its sweet and medicinal taste, followed by a soft sweet licorice flavour at the back. However, it flags slightly when the band aid remains in the mouth along with a cloying, clinging sweey coating of the mouth. The Lindeman's is much simpler, and more direct. It is intensely sweet initially, but that soon settles into a balance between sweetness and acidity. The mouthfeel really pushes the Lindeman's into first place. Chapeau has a soft mouthfeel with a barely noticable and soon gone gentle fizz - quite boring. The Lindeman's however has a soft fizzy mothfeel - very gentle like having baby rabbits tickle your mouth. Weee! The conclusion is that Chapeau is a flavoursome and interesting drink, but lacks the fun of Lindeman's despite the fuller and more complex flavours.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"
2252,"2003-06-09",2.2,"The aroma is sweet with the sharpness from wild fermentation but also with som weird notes; is it some kind of flower, elder flower perhaps? The aroma is not good for a lambic. The color of the beer is amber and slightly unclear with a fine head. The flavor is sweet and sour, but without the bite that lambics have to have. It also lacks the metallicness that is carachteristic for lambics. But instead it the elder flower flavor. And the flavor disappears extremely fast. All in all a thin boring lambic. I am puzzled by the ingredient list - it includes yeast???? in a lambic?","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
2252,"2002-10-14",2.7,"Best before date - May 97. Hazy lemony dark orange. Thin, sticky, big bubbled white head. Barely any carbonation. Sour, oak aroma with notes of grape, candy sugar and horse hair. Initially tart, sweet and a bit chalky. Light bodied. Sweetness overwhelms the Lambic sourness and horsebarn qualities. Lingers on as a sticky, candyish aftertaste. Tart and horsebarn like on each sip, then it fades into the sticky sweetness all too quick. Finishes with a ciderish tartness and flash of its musty, old age. Way too sweet as it warmed. My wife ended up finishing it.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"
