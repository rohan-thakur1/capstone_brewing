2120,"2013-10-09",3.2,"This beer is a semi-regular in my local Wetherspoons, but have never seen it anywhere else. This rate/review is from 9th Oct 2013.

Clear golden body every time: always a hand-pulled pint by the way, the head is white and with a creamy texture, lacing clings to the glass.

Floral hop nose and taste with an undercurrent of maltiness trying to get through. The finish is fairly bitter, but not dry: well balanced overall, hops front, rear and center, with a good measure of malts preventing too much bitterness or total hop control.Earlier Rating: 4/7/2012 Total Score: 3.7First had this in the summer of 2010, with friends on the banks of the river Severn about two miles from the brewery: this review however is from another cask ale outlet, my local Wetherspoons in Jan 2012, two pints hand pulled.

This is a good looking beer, golden/light amber body with a full white crown which stays as well as leaving lacing on the glass.

They use US hops in the brew to give it a hoppy aroma and taste, but dont over do it: I guess Cascade (mostly) being the ones giving the hop feel. The smell is therefore hoppy, piney and semi-citrusy.

The taste is predominately hoppy with the malt content preventing a complete take over, good combination of flavours, some grapefruit dryness and bitterness combated by the milder malts.

2120,"2013-07-04",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 21, 2016 My Bottom Line:
This crisp and aromatic Golden Ale refreshes with spicy and citrusy hops laid upon well polished straw-like pale malts.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the clear golden.
-Carbonation is not trying to emulate a cask. In this case, its perfectly fine since the bubbly feel enhances the crispness. This drinks like an Anglo interpretation of a German Pils.
-This is gorgeous for our summer heat and humidity.
-Love the nose on this one. Delicate but theres lots going on.
-Ultimately, this is not the most memorable Golden Ale on the world scale. However, its so intricate, polished and quenching that I cannot deem it less than world-class.
