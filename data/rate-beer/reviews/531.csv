531,"2011-06-09",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
Peat smoke, coffee beans and blackberry syrup delve into roastiness and grassy hops for a verbose Smoked Imperial Stout.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the dark brown.
-Vinegary edges mar the linear nose.
-The body is sweet, but still healthy (neither heavy nor thin).
-The roasted malt profile in the finish and the prevalent fruitiness didnt quite agree.
-I was expecting better from Lambrate, especially since the regular Ghisa on tap was wonderful. I get the impression the bottle here was not at its best.

531,"2010-05-14",3.8,"In short: A smoky peaty chocolaty black beer.  Very nice.
How: Bottle 330ml.  Shared by/with the owner of Domus Birrae (Rome Italy) on location 
The look: Black body topped by a medium tan head
In long: Nose is dominated by a nice peaty smoke.  Body is smooth and velvety.  Taste is a mix of peat, black chocolate, smoke, cookies.  Each flavor element has its place, nothing dominates.  Nothing revolutionary here, but the execution is top-notch.  Ghisa is Italian for Cast Iron.  Remember that.  This could make all the difference in the world in a possible future blind-date with a smoking hot Italian metallurgical engineer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
