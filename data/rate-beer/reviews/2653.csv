2653,"2017-03-08",4.2,"375 mL bottle. Originally reviewed sometime in 2013.

Mostly flat and very dark, but just shy of black. Leggy and viscous.

Smells of lots of brandy and bourbon. Toffee and caramel. Dark roasted malts. Boozy.

Tastes of strong brandy and vanilla. Chocolate comes behind it. The finish is boozy with a nice blend of sweet dark chocolate.

Very boozy. The body drops off a bit. Low carbonation.

2653,"2016-11-30",3.8,"From notes. Enjoyed this at Mickeys 30th birthday bash on November 05. 375 mL bottle. The pour is a nice light black/dark brown with a thin brown ring of head and no lace. The aroma is full of dark fruits, caramel, roasted malt, light chocolate, and a light alcohol. Its pretty good. There is a light bourbon to it, and a great sweetness. The flavor is much of the same. There is a light dark fruit, chocolate, caramel, bourbon, and a good fudginess. The mouth feel is thicker and light with a brighter carbonation and a lingeringly sweet and chocolatey bourbon finish. Its surprisingly good, though its sweet.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

2653,"2016-04-01",4.0,"375ml bottle acquired via trade on BA. Shared with deyholla. Pours a deeper dark blackish brown hue, opaque body shows some brownish toasty glow on the edges. A smaller brownish head atop dies down quickly, remains as a mellow ringer with subtle lacing overall. Aromas are big and rich, caramel and cocoa meet toffee, toast and biscuits. Vanilla and a decent oak presence show bourbon spirit, wet wood and some popping apple brandy appeal. Woody, sweeter, and tangy appeal on the nose. Initial is a bit deadened by the firm barrel presence, lots of vanilla, wet wood and tannic appeal. Some gentle warmth as the sweeter malts beneath peek through the wood work. Toasty, carmelized and biscuity as lots of vanilla, tannic wood really set the pace. A splash of marshmallow, carmelized and toasty malts. Earth, nougat, a but of nuttiness. This one is a bit overbarreled but it still seems to work. The brandy presence that shows a bit more assertively on the nose ends up a bit more nondeScript back here, showing firmer big woody presence. Some lingering body helps it hold on, cola-esque appeal with jabs of dark fruit, caramel and roasty black malts. Dark fruit, vinous appeal as we get into it. Pretty complex, lots of wood, an appealing nose and pretty pour. Really fun blend here with some jabby spirit, rich wood presence.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Cant go wrong. Excellent stuff.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
2653,"2015-11-12",4.6,"Pitch black and completely opaque with a one finger mocha head that slowly settles into a thin, lasting ring. Good retention for the style. Spotty lacing left behind. 

Very inviting aroma with a really nice barrel character that doesnt overpower the notes of the base beers. Plenty of roast, dark chocolate, gourmet coffee and caramel. Prominent toasted oak and a strong vanilla presence along with some marshmallow and toasted coconut mellowing out the spicy bourbon and brandy notes. Sweet and desert like silky malt backbone with bakers chocolate, fudge and chocolate cake followed by some toffee and espresso. Smells amazing! 

On the fuller end of medium bodied with a really complex and delicious flavor profile. Really nice spirit presence thats perfectly integrated into the dark malt elements of the base beers. Dry toasted oak, vanilla, marshmallow and toasted coconut along with spicy bourbon and sweet brandy notes. This is coutered by luscious dark chocolate, toffee, coconut, perfectly roasted espresso bean and vanilla bean. The malt backbone has a ton of fudge-y chocolate flavor that is such a perfect compliment to the barrel notes and sweet alcohol. The high abv is excellently masked making this complex and delicious beer dangerously drinkable. One of the best barrel aged beers Ive had.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

2653,"2015-07-17",4.2,"375 ml bottle purchased at the brewery in December 2013 for $20.00 (now nicely aged even further). After struggling with the cork, this pours a near pitch black with some dark brown around the edges and some yeastie-floaties low in the glass. Except for a few tan bubbles on the edge, there is basically no carbonation at all (thought Lost Abbey had overcome this issue from a few years ago). AROMA of sweet sticky caramel, various spirits barrel notes (lots of bourbon, some port, but less brandy than I would expect), vanilla, milk chocolate candy, bourbon-soaked marshmallow, butterscotch, maple syrup, and brown sugar. FLAVOR of buttered toffee, sweet bourbon, vanilla, bits of cognac and port wine, chocolate (kind of cafe mocha with some coffee-ness in it), thick molasses, and and a hint of sweet-ish brandy-like booze. This is notably sweeter than others in the Angels Share family which is a little distracting. The high ABV is generally well hidden but there is some detectable ethyl alcohol (at 14.3%, it is heftier in the booze department compared to the 12%-ish of others in the Angels Share family). Overall it feels much lighter in body than others in the Angels Share family (possibly an effect of the almost zero carbonation??). Possibly a weaker link in this excellent family, but still an excellent complex beer for sipping. (68, 974)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"

Aroma drew me back in: rich bourbon vanilla and subtle Mon Chérie preserved black cherry in chocolate, bourbon-soaked butterscotch cake, some cognac and yet almost no abv burn. Taste is a lusciously layered symphony of dry and woody bourbon barrel tying in together decadant chocolate cherry, a dry raisin edge, before a second dessert of vanilla-dark chocolate ice cream cake kicks in, given depth by a fruity bourbon, more stone fruit and oak cask. Some tawny port character (red fruits), oily mouthfeel with no carbonation.

2653,"2013-02-06",4.1,"On tap for the Monks dinner with Simon, Keith, and Jredmond. Pours pitch black with no head, aromas and taste of smooth bourbon, dough, caramel, light brandy, chocolate fudge, light peat, and maple. Nice warming effect in the belly. Very rich in flavor. Became super colorful with a hazy extract addition that our table enjoyed. Relatively easy going and non boozey for the 14 but could still use some softening. I enjoyed this one but think it will be a beast of a brew in 2-4 years. Thanks Tomme.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
2653,"2013-02-05",4.2,"On tap at Monks after Jeff Mangum with Pat, Sean, and Janine. Pours a deep black with 2 fingers of tan head.  Nose of vanilla, chocolate, oak, raisin, bourbon. I dont know how something this high in abv tastes so smooth.  Delicious, with a lightly warming burn.","Pennsylvania, USA","tcane7"
2653,"2013-02-05",4.2,"On tap at Monk's after Jeff Mangum with Janine, Sean, and Tom. Pours solid black, no head. Aroma of a chocolate covered marshmallow. Taste is chocolate fudge, caramel, vanilla, and bourbon. Full, rich, boozy palate with a velvety smooth finish. Fucking outrageously smooth for a 14.3%. Hell of a beer. Cheers, Tomme.

2653,"2013-02-05",4.3,"Bottle.  One of my favorites of the lot.  Dark brown/black pour with no head.  Huge caramel and chocolate aromas.  Creamy and smooth with luscious chocolate and caramel notes.  A little thin in the body, but still outstanding overall.....","Florida, USA","50belair"
2653,"2013-02-03",4.1,"Bottle pours with a nice deep mahogany body that supports a micro thin tan head of foam. The aroma offers up molasses covered coconut, a bit of vanilla and then some boozy heat at the end of the draw. The taste is similar with a mix of molasses, some caramel, a coconut note and then a touch of vanilla. Behind those flavors I get some chocolate and dark roasted malts before boozy heat takes this into the finish. Nice sipper for sure.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
2653,"2013-01-30",4.4,"Bottle shared at Santa Cruz boxset tasting. Massive vanilla and milk chocolate, syrupy sweet, cinnamon, light barrel coconut, bourbon, peppery booze. Luxurious and rich and sweet. Incredible.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
2653,"2013-01-27",4.4,"Almost a black pour, brown head.  Rich bourbon, brandy, vanilla, chocolate, fudge, charred wood, just delicious.  Decadent and rich.  Nice stuff!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
2653,"2012-12-09",4.3,"Lost Abbey track beer tasting.

The beer appears near black with a thin, beige head that rapidly fades to just a thin collar around the perimeter. The aroma offers both bourbon and brandy, each distinguishable. Ooo, this is wonderful. Extremely well balanced and teeming with flavor. Alcohol presence is well disguised. Lots of delicious flavor and so easy to drink...too easy, given the high abv. Outstanding.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
2653,"2012-12-09",4.1,"Track tasting. Not a loud pop, poured a dark color, perhaps even black, no head to speak of. Woah. Toffee, caramel notes, some alcohol touch here. Flavor is about the same - sweet malts here, quite good!","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
2653,"2012-07-15",4.2,"Pours black in color with a thin khaki colored head.  Rich and decadent nose to this.  Bourbon and brandy with tons of vanilla.  A definite booziness, but its enjoyable.  Plenty of chocolate, some dark fruit, and a touch of roasted malt.  The flavor is quite sweet with lots of molasses, chocolate, vanilla, and dark fruit.  The flavors of the brandy and bourbon are very pronounced and enjoyable as well.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2653,"2012-07-10",4.4,"Bottle shared with Linh at lost abbey. Pours a deep, thick black body with thin brown lacing. Aroma is rich raisins, molasses, chocolate and a touch of vanilla. Mouthfeel is thick with luscious notes of chocolate covered raisins, Bourbon, light toasted cinnamon bread, chocolate, vanilla and a very light booze. This is incredibly smooth given the near 15% abv. I think this. Ariation of the barrel aging & blending works better than deliverance.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
2653,"2012-07-06",4.2,"Bottle. Pours with a menacing, jet black hued body. Completely opaque with a small tan head that fades to a ring. Alcohol legs rise above the body. Aromas are fudgy, nutty, earthy, rich barrel, lots of tannin, vanillin, campfire, chocolate, nougat, dark fruits, brandy, raisins, honey, floral, alcohol, rosewater. Rich, chestnuts, light char and molasses. Flavors are nutty, walnuts, boozy, chocolatey, saw dust, oak tannin, vanilla, nougat. Very rich and decadent, but not too sweet. Vinous, roasty, cherry, toasted malt. Very, very complex. Cola, boozy, tannic, dry, very warming, vinous, melanodins, medium carbonation. Pretty excellent!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
2653,"2012-06-24",4.2,"Bottle at brewery. Extremely dark brown pour with a minimal slick of dark expresso foam.  Aroma is sweet, mellow brandy with marshmellow followed by some roast from the Serpents and a heavy dose of bourbon from the angels share.  Taste is dominated by the bourbon angels share with some sweetness from the brandy and minimal roast under the barrel influence.  Alcohol barely noticeable.  Smooth, coating and decadent.  Excellent beer.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"
2653,"2012-06-18",4.3,"Pour from the bottle at LA. Pitch black in color with very thin mocha head. Aromas of sweetness with chocolate, and mild barrel characteristics. Super velvety smooth on your palate. Flavors are complex and blend really nicely. Vanilla, brown sugar, bourbon, anise, cocoa, and Mellow roasted malts. Long finish. Super tasty and overall a bit sweeter than Deliverance but equally as good in my book!","encinitas, California, USA","nightrider"
2653,"2012-06-18",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2012 Bottle at the brewery.  Nice notes of brandy in the nose.  Flavors of strong vanilla, brown sugar sweetness, brandy barrel character, and milk chocolate.  Warming, but the alcohol is not noticeable.  A really good dessert sipper.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
2653,"2012-06-16",4.2,"Lost Abbey track 6. 375mL at brewery. Black with a creamy 1 1/2 finger tan head, down to a thick ring and film. 20 minutes later there isnt a single bubble, and almost no head is roused. Lots of barrel character in the nose--seems like the brandy is stronger. Much vanilla. Nice sweet toffee and brown sugar notes from the AS, as well as some decaying leaves. I get some leather and light bready yeast as it warms up. Flavor is pretty well the same. Chocolate and roast also present from the SS. I like this better than Deliverance--its missing most of the burnt char character. Still has plenty of spicy alcohol heat--it is 14.4% ABV, or somewhere around there. Semi-dry, bitterness at a 3, just a little char. Big full body, lightened by the alcohol, soft carbonation. Very tasty. And boozy. 9-4-8-4-17--4.2","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
2653,"2012-06-16",4.4,"6/16/12- Pour a viscous deep opaque black with a thin coffee colored head. Aromas of raisin, chocolate, vanilla caramel. Smells thick. Very full mouthfeel with a touch of carbonation. Slick and sticky all at once. Notes of vanilla, leather, tobacco, oak, brandy, and chocolate on a warming finish. Very complex rich beer. It's a shame that lost abbey makes you drink it on premise. A very very very big sipper. Overall I like it, but obviously not very drinkable.
