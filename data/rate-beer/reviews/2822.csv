2822,"2015-11-23",3.6,"500 ml. bottle purchased at The Beer Mongers in Portland, Oregon. Bottled on 08 18 15 printed on the label. The pour is a clear pale golden with a well formed one inch white head. Tons of fine carbonation bubbles rise from the bottom the glass. The aroma is fresh cereal grain, floral citrus, and some soft sweet malt. The taste is the crisp clean malt profile, cracker grain malt, balanced nicely with drying floral hops. Some bright citrus notes in the beer there as well. As the beer warms, grain gets a bit of a husky character which makes it a bit less clean, but does give some depth. The palate is light bodied, full carbonation, and the clean floral citrus crisp finish. Easy drinking Pils.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

2822,"2015-11-12",4.2,"Draught at Matts in the Market, 11/4/15.Lovely, bright, white grape juice color with a hint of copper. Good carbonation coursing upwards creating a white head with moderate retention.Delicate floral hops, adding all sorts of aromatics, with light, fresh herbal accents. Just a touch of baked bread is noted in the aroma, with honey and light biscuit being prominent. Pretty much exactly what Im looking for in a pilsner. Clean, with no flaw and not Americanized.The flavor outdoes the aroma by a good margin, which is impressive. Fantastically tart white grape juice notes (a play between hop and the very lightly toasted grain) give way to a delicate honey sweetness that is in turn whisked away by tight carbonation as soft, floral hops linger pleasantly on the finish. Wonderfully attenuated and incredibly drinkable/refreshing. I found Pfriem to be much more successful on draught than in the bottle, which seems to be echoed by other ratings here.  Didnt find any soapiness that some mentioned, nor did I find there to be any excess of hop resin.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

I just love it that more and more US breweries are starting to brew solid pilsners. This is a quality addition to that lineup. Relatively light pour for a pils, nice fluffy white head. Super grassy nose, noble hops and some skunk piss. The flavor dances between bready malt almost pushing toward sweetness, and dry noble hops. Mouthfeel is spot on for the style. While distinctively American, this is not an overhopped west coast reinterpretation of a pils with something to prove. Its just a really solid beer.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

A: Clear, brilliant gold with a firm cloud-fluff white head and bubble geysers flowing throughout.

M: Very light bodied, spritzy carbonation, no alcohol.
