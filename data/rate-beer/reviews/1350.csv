1350,"2015-07-26",3.9,"Poured from a bottle. Good head, chocolate brown, distinctive bourbon aroma. Smooth and creamy, nice bite on the finish.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","kidobutai"
1350,"2014-09-18",2.9,"22oz bottle pours a hazy, copper amber with some clump, thin, off white head. Nose is straight forward, malt, mild cracker, plenty of figs and dates, some brown sugar, a little earthy, perhaps a little dried citrus. Fairly mild on the nose and the flavor follows. Tastes sweet, mildly bitter, more of a mild soapy bitterness, cracker, a little umami, some raisin... but not a whole lot else. Clean finish. Not offensive, but lacks the complexity of better scotch ales.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
1350,"2014-08-10",3.5,"Caramel, nutty aromas, some toasted biscuit, some raisiny dried fruit. Clear bronze-ruby with a lasting beige head. Initial sweet malts, vanilla, caramel, becomes a little hop-dominant throughout. Medium bodied.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","Emeister84"
1350,"2014-08-10",3.6,"Malty biscuit aroma and caramel and minor cocoa. Foamy off white head and rusty reddish brown body. Sweet malty flavor with minor chocolate and bread notes and some hops. Crisp thin body.","Virginia, USA","zickbeer_ye"
1350,"2014-08-10",3.2,"Sweet aromas, dried fruit, malt, very little caramel. Sweet and smooth. Slightly bitter and hoppy, but roasty. Finishes clean and sweet, but not very malty or nutty like I expected.","Virginia, USA","HellesBunny666"
1350,"2014-05-23",3.4,"Bomber->fluted snifter. Deep amber with moderate lite tan head. A: caramel malt, rye, dark grains, whisky. T: peat, malt, grains, booze. Mild bitter aftertaste cuts the sweetness of the body. Ok.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","DCLawyer"
1350,"2014-04-03",3.0,"22 oz bottle Vintage 2014 Purchased at Tom Leonards in Western Henrico The ale poured a clear deep amber to reddish color. A very attractive ale with a small off white head and some lacing. The aroma was malty with caramel and a kiss of bourbon. The medium body ale had active carbonation. The flavor was sweet with maybe some toffee. The finish also ended with an earthy sweetness and a hint of bourbon . No bitterness. The 7% abv was a nice feature.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Foxbush"
1350,"2014-03-30",3.6,"Sample at Station 2. Clear brownish-amber color with a medium thin light beige head that dissipates steadily to a film. Short strings of lacing on the glass. Aroma of dark fruit, roast malt and hops. Medium body with flavors of peaty malt, ripe fruit and earthy hops. The finish is sweet with a malty aftertaste. Decent overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
1350,"2014-02-09",3.9,"I think there may be some rating confusion going on here - I may be mistaken, but I believe that there is a straight up Scotchtown versus a barrel aged version. Ive had the barrel aged, this was my first time with a pint of the regular. Pours a deep reddish brown, decent head. Aroma is malty, toffee and a touch of caramel. Flavor is a match, full bodied, but not cloying. Really nice example of the style, liked it quite a bit.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
1350,"2013-10-08",3.5,"Bottle pours with a mahogany colored body that supports a tan head. The aroma offers up roasted malts, dusty malts and sort of a sweet caramel malt note. The taste has prunes and brown sugar dusted peach wedges. It then moves into sweet malts, figs and then caramel malts. Not coming together perfect but still an agreeable elixir.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
1350,"2013-10-08",3.5,"Dark brown pour, off white head. Sweet vanilla, toffee, hints of oxidized apples, some toothpick flavors and caramel.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"

Aroma of caramel, toffee, earth, green apple. The taste is raisin, toffee, toasted malts. Medium bodied, highly carbonated.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
1350,"2013-04-25",3.6,"Label makes no mention of any barrel aging, only  ""Limited edition February 2013"". The label features a cool tartan background with a Virginia Historical Marker sign in the foreground with the name Scotchtown. On to the liquid: Cranberry and caramel nose, equal proportions and moderate intensity. Clear tea colored, medium yellow head. Earthy, mossy, elderberry flavor. Neither very sweet nor very tart. Slightly bitter toward the end, dried leaves throughout. Rather savory actually. Solid, well made, this brewers got chops.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
