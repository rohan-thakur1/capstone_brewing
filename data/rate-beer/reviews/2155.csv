Has a definite sweet middle, caramel and sugar, yet the finish dries out considerably, letting bitter juniper mix with mild hops and a understated yeasty background. Not getting much rye, but the juniper builds as it warms.

All flavors are very well balanced, though perhaps the rye might be most prominent in here. Its lighter in body, with a thinner texture, but with quite a bit of bubbly carbonation.

Somehow better than the sum of its parts, this American take on the sahti is a little too medicinal for my personal tastes. Dial it down a notch and this unusual release would be a great way to convince people who hate ""the taste of beer"" that not everything is like a cheap adjunct lager.

Aroma / Appearance - Being an emphatic gusher did little to initially endear me to this beer. Finally settling down, it still bubbled with life like a deeper colored champagne. Juniper, figs, and malt felt true to style yet lacking the spirit of a native take.

Flavor / Palate - Juniper and raspberries steeped in iced tea refresh without leaving a sticky trace. Semisweet with a thin body, it teases the palate with flashes of more. A medicinal finish might be par for the course but still feels a little off the mark. Overall the total package has just enough flaws to put it below average without being completely unappealing.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

2155,"2015-05-16",3.6,"On tap at The Birch, Norfolk, VA during the 43 Hours Of USA 2015. Brownish-orange pour with a frothy off-white head. Aroma of rye and juniper with a hint of orange zest. Taste is slightly fruity upfront with cherry and orange but is followed by sweetness from the rye. Think somewhere between an ESB and an amber ale and you have this beer. Good overall.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","zizzybalubba"
2155,"2015-05-16",3.7,"Bottle. Pours a dark caramel amber with a frothy light tan head. There are scents of sweet caramel, nutmeg, and spices. The taste falls somewhere between a vienna lager and winter warmer. There is a great caramel malt character with the spices of juniper, clove, nutmeg, and allspice. The spices are much mellower than a winter warmer because the malt flavors are strong and pleasant. Medium carbonation with a thin mouthfeel that finishes wet. The spices linger nicely on the back side.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","c_lee_burton"
2155,"2015-05-15",3.3,"4 oz pour on draft at ChurchKey. Clear dark amber with off-white head. Aromas of herbs, spice, berries. Tastes of berries, malt, spices, fruit syrup. Medium-light body with a dry finish.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"
2155,"2015-05-14",3.7,"This isnt a beer style Id return to often, but it had a unique sweetness that wasnt cloying or abrasive. Juniper was apparent in this orangish, medium bodied beer.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","ads135"
2155,"2015-05-13",3.1,"Draft to snifter at Dutchs (shared by Tmoney99). Looks solid; a hazy caramel with off-white head that steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells of esters, spices, and yeast. Tastes like it smells with a medium-bodied mouthfeel. Okay.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
2155,"2015-05-13",3.6,"Aroma is juniper, spices and mild sweetness. The flavor is spices, very sweet bubblegum, malts and a mix of heat and slight alcohol burn in the finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
2155,"2015-05-12",3.2,"(On Tap) Hazy red brown with good off-white head. Not a lot of aroma - slight barnyard and spice. Medium body, slightly creamy, modest tingly fizzy carbonation. Rich creamy caramel taste with hints of spice, funk, yoghurt. Unusual pleasant beer.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Pyobon"
2155,"2015-05-11",3.5,"A wonderful example of style (Ive had two of them). Juniper and, well, rye. Light sweet and sour finish. Pours reddish amber with OK head and lacing. Soft carbonation. Tap at Churchkey.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
2155,"2015-05-10",3.4,"Draft (4 oz) at Dutchs. Pours a hazy orange amber color with a medium plus sized, creamy beige head. The aroma and flavor have a general fruity character, juniper, spicy rye, yeast, medium bodied, malty, soft finish, interesting to try, could stand to be more dry and herbal.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
2155,"2015-05-10",3.4,"On tap at Dutchs. Pours pretty foamy, initially. Head settles to a thin tan layer. Leaves sort of loose, bubbly bits of lace. Hazy darker amber orange color. Tasty mix of rye and juniper in the flavor, some spiciness. Medium to bigger body, good full feel, kind of chewy. Light slick texture. Moderate sweet taste, light bitterness. Hint of chocolate. Decent stuff overall -- interesting to try. Has a winter ale feel to it -- unfortunate that it only recently became available in this area","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
2155,"2015-05-08",3.3,"Draft at planB West Hartford. Pours light brown with a thin khaki head. Leaves some lacing in the glass. Not getting a lot on the nose. A bit sweet on the tongue with the occasional berry note. Finishes clean. First of the style Ive sampled so I dont know what Im tasting for but this one is not blowing my doors off.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
2155,"2015-05-08",2.8,"12oz bottle pours an amber/orange with a medium light khaki head. Coriander and yeast aroma, with juniper and rye. Taste has all the spice and juniper upfront falling back into rye and roasted barley. Nice to try another Sahti, but not a fan of this one.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
2155,"2015-05-07",3.5,"12 oz bottle supplied by Willrunforbeer, thanks for my final style tick!! And Brian made me try this blind before I knew Clear brown color without any head. Aroma is spruce tips and chocolate. The flavor is straight up spruce tips (or now I know Juniper ) with hints of yeast and spice. Glad to have tried this style. Reminds me of a gruit.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2155,"2015-05-07",3.6,"12oz bottle saved for me by Jason at 7-11. Thanks! Pours medium amber with a scant beige head. Aroma is caramel, dark chocolate, pine. Flavor is pretty earthy... Caramel, spruce, sage. A pretty interesting brew.","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
2155,"2015-04-28",3.4,"Pours rich sienna color with a finger of sticky eggshell foam. Lots of sweet malty notes mingle with some woodsy sap and soft juniper fruit. A touch sticky but the rye spice amps up the flavors in an interesting way and the bitterness of the pine and juniper flavors creates enough complexity to keep me sipping. Just a bit too malty and under-attenuated for my personal palate. If this were a touch drier it would be bad ass.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
2155,"2015-04-27",3.9,"On tap at Au Cheval. Poured hazy red amber with min head. Aroma sweet malty fruity juniper. Light carb med bod. Tastes nice balanced malty.","New York, New York, USA","charule"

2155,"2015-04-19",3.6,"Cloudy brown-orange with a decent amount of light tan head. Banana phenolic, honey and some (unsurprisingly) juniper. Lots of sweetness, Cheerios. Lighter body, clean, long malty finish. Not bad at all.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","markducommun"
2155,"2015-04-13",3.6,"2015 bottle. Pours a very hazy dark orange and copper with a big off-white head. Aroma is a little bubble gum, banana and berry. Taste is slightly sweet with banana, white pepper, rye and a berry taste. Soft medium body with lots of carbonation. Reminiscent of a Belgian dubbel with the distinct taste of rye.

2155,"2015-04-10",3.7,"Bottle grabbed off handily at store didnt know Off Color tried their hand at the Sahti game. Pours amber with sudsy head less murky than traditional satis Ive seen. Nose is bread and juniper. Tastes of junipers, rye bread, pepper, light banana. Fine slight chewy palate. Noble effort at this style.","New York, USA","Jow"
2155,"2015-04-02",3.3,"Bottle. Pours a hazy dark sepia color, creamy off-white head with exceptional retention and lacing. Nose is light spicy funk, minerals, wood, earth, kinda what Id imagine a Lapland reindeer-herders cabin to smell like. Mouth is medium bodied, creamy palate, lots of spicy rye, barley, light tangy, touch of caramel sweetness, finishes kinda watery though. Decent, but I was hoping for a more prominent display of juniper and overall oomph.. although the 7% is undetectable.","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"
2155,"2015-03-28",3.2,"12oz bottle. Filtered orange-tan body. Quick dissipating soda-like off white head. The aroma is brutal, not pleasant at all. Kind of drinks like a big but thin brown ale, with overbearing juniper and rye. A lot of gingerbread, but it grew on me.  The medium-ish thick body helps keep it drinkable, despite the big flavors.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
2155,"2015-03-27",3.5,"A murky reddish brown color with a small off white head and little lacing. Aroma is sort of interesting with some belgian yeast esters, white grapes, toasted malt and some spiciness like clove and nutmeg. The taste has a bit of fruity sweetness along with some tannic oak and grape flavor. Mid palate you get some rye spiciness and clove along with toasted malt. Finishes dry with some malt flavor and a bit of spiciness. Medium bodied with carbonation that is lively and fizzes on your tongue. Interesting and well made.","Missouri, USA","jeremyh70"

2155,"2015-03-14",4.1,"The nose features a berry aroma with some spice and alcohol. It is a medium golden color with a full body. The flavor is grounded with yeast and grain balanced with light berries. The mouthfeel is full with noticeable alcohol flavors. Overall, I really enjoy this beer. It balances a lot of different flavors but gives it a good warming beer experience.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"

2155,"2015-03-04",3.8,"Bottle thanks to the Aaron. Aroma is similar to a hefeweisen. I really get the clove. Not so much juniper, but dont know what the style should have. Flavor brings out a few more spices and finishes dry. Interesting beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AndyReynolds"

2155,"2015-02-27",3.7,"This is a relatively new style to me; old to the Finns. I would love to enjoy it in a sauna, but for now must settle for it on a cheap third floor apartment in a mediocre neighborhood in Chicago alongside a poor gas fireplace.","","AlastairEvans"
