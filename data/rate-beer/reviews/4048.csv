Creamy medium body with lively carb. Lightly toasted caramel underneath on the mid palate, holding up a gigantic wash of grapefruit, pith, and rind all the way into a very dry finish.

Relatively light pour, light tan head. Spicy new-school nose, befitting of the Simcoe and Citra that this one is made from. Bit of sour citrus, bit of citra polecat, but so sign of the garlic-and-onion that mars so many newfangled pale ales. Malts are way in the background, and the hops, which packing a big aroma, are at pale ale levels making this an extremely drinkable beer with none of the lingering bitterness on the mouth long after finishing a comparable IPA. Super tasty, good-drinking stuff, just as Ive come to expect from Fremont.  8/4/8/4/16=4.0

Tap at Fiddlers simply listed as Fremont Simcoe Fresh Hop. Clear pour, a bit more resiny than expected and not quite as juicy. Certainly good, but I enjoyed the Seapine Mosaic Pale that preceded it quite a bit more. Id go about 3.7 or 3.8 on this one. Knocking the original score down in that direction.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Can: The aroma consists of moderate citrus, light dank notes, grass, and light herbal notes. It pours a mostly transparent golden-orange with a touch of haze. It has a one finger white head that quickly fades to a thin ring outlined by a thick soapy ring. It leaves behind a thin sheet of soapy webbing on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with a quick dose of citrus and faint tropical fruit. The finish has light-moderate grapefruit, light dank notes, hints of lemon, and some faint herbal notes.

4048,"2013-10-15",4.3,"Rating #6600. 651mL from Pear in Pike Place Market. Pours a clear, lighter orange with mega rocky, beautiful buttercream toppings. Thick lacing all over the globe. Nose is holy monkey dank, juicy passionfruit and mango style hops. Taste showcases Fremonts unequaled ability to create a soft, composed malt backbone that balances the soft hop bitterness without there being any stickiness, abrasiveness, thick nut skin tannic bite, heavy nut oil fat density that bloats the stomach. In that sense, this deserves an easy 5 for palate as do at least three other Fremont beers, which is quite the rarity to be dished out by me. The malt extraction, softness, and balanced malt backbone shows some serious brewing knowledge that restores my faith in humanity. Each gulp of this beer, oh lord, its good.

The look: Partly cloudy golden body topped by a large beige head.
In long: Highly aromatic nose proposing an interesting array of fruits (passion fruits, grapefruits, kiwis, orange peels, ) over a bed of flowers and juicy freshly cut grass.  Taste starts with toasted cereals with low sweetness sensation (husky grains, Melba Toasts) and some bread dough which are quickly overwhelmed by the generous hopping, wet grass juice, bitter citrus fruits, vegetal notes (lettuce), orange peels.  Bitterness level in the medium range.  A little bit too vegetal but overall still pretty good.  More of an IPA than an APA (current ratebeer classification), but then again if beers like Half Acre Daisy Cutter and Hill Farmstead Edward can be classified APA, so can this one.  Nice to know this is an organic beer, and I dont want to brag but I am actually 100% biodegradable.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4048,"2012-11-29",4.2,"You can taste how fresh it is! The aroma is bright, floral and citrusy. The Citra hops are clearly the star here (obviously). The flavors are not super balanced, the scale definitely tips towards the hoppy side. This is exactly what I want out of a fresh hop IPA! I dont want a bunch of malty sweetness muddling the fresh, local, organic hops. The bitterness is at the forefront and it slowly creeps to the back of the tongue and it lingers there for a while.

Im drinking this with my Thai style garlic chicken and green beans (about 10 stars). What a great pairing! I had a few good beers to choose from in the beer fridge and Im glad I chose this one.

Go out and find this beer; you wont be sorry. Support organic! Support Seattle!","Tacoma, Washington, USA","jnanakul"
4048,"2012-11-25",3.9,"Second half of this bomber is delicious. Warmed up a bit and the fine yeast cloud adds some smoothness. Rather light bodied but full of balanced flavor.hops are the feature  lemony and passion fruit. Delicate malt balanced.id say more of a tame ipa or advanced pale ale. Awesome nonetheless.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"
4048,"2012-11-11",4.2,"Bottle...  Poured hazy, bright orange with a nice forming eggy/white head.  Nose is just a bomb of floral and grassy hops. Totally solid IPA. Super clean and balanced with straight hop flavors without being too bitter. Citrus, pine, light fruits and malt too. The best fresh hop beer I have had in 2012.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"

A: Pours a clear amber color with a frothy white head forming on the pour. The head has great retention and recedes slowly leaving behind sticky and soapy looking spot of lace. 

S: A juicy bouquet of tropical fruits. Mango, papaya and green melon make a strong presence up front. There is some light grass and pale malts towards the back end that really round out the nose.

T: Most malty than the nose suggests. A pale malt sweetness is up front with a nice mix of grassy hops and just a kiss of tropical fruits. There is a light bitter hop finish as well.

M: Light bodied with a slight stick to the mouthfeel. Nice medium high carbonation makes this guy easily drinkable as well.

O: A very delicious beer. As Ive noticed with a few of the Fremont beers Ive had the taste doesnt quite live up to the nose. Still a highly drinkable and balanced beer that Id have again.

4048,"2012-10-31",3.9,"Aroma wasnt too heavy but was very pleasantly surprised when I tasted it. Lots of tropical fruit notes, bananas,guava, etc. Great balanced bitterness and a simple grain bill to showcase the fresh hops. Very good.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","bigwesticle"
4048,"2012-10-18",3.9,"Ive been drinking quite a few fresh hop ales lately, and so far, this is one of the stand-outs. Its spicy, piney and delicious. Has a nice ""green-ness"" to it, and its grassy and zingy on the palate. Snappy bitterness in the finish, but its nicely balanced. Sweet citrus (tangerine and grapefruit mostly) in the aromas gives it real depth. Juicy and tasty!","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
4048,"2012-10-15",3.8,"On tap at Bottleworks, pours a hazy golden with a small white head. Aroma is very skunky, with loads of herbal, pot-like hops and some doughy malt. Flavour is very fresh, full of skunky, herbal hops, some pot, and a bit of doughy malt to back without really influencing the flavour. Well-crafted and highly drinkable. Surprised me that this is classified as an APA, not IPA.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
4048,"2012-10-11",3.7,"22 oz bottle from PCC. Pours thin pale golden with lacey, lingering head. Aroma is big fresh aromatic pine hops. Same hops dominate the taste. Thin pale malts are decidedly in the background. Clean taste with crisp bitter finish. Low ABV (relatively) keeps this quite sessionable. Deserves the hype - this is one of the better fresh hop beers around.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"
4048,"2012-10-07",3.5,"Pours an orange gold with a thick lacy white head. Aroma of bitter simcoe hops with a slight malt profile. Taste follows, light yet bitter with a nice malt backbone. Very nice, easy to drink fresh tasting pale ale

4048,"2012-10-04",3.9,"Pours mostly clear, copper-orange with a light, minimal head.  Excellent aroma of pine and citrus.  Flavor ditches the citrus for heavy resinous, lasting pine.  Light caramel and grass.  Moderately bitter finish. This is an awesome fresh-hop beer.","Seattle, Washington, USA","crackedmachine"

4048,"2011-10-22",4.2,"Bomber. Pours a bright golden orange color with an inch of thick off-white head. The aroma is a sweet blend of resiny hops and cannabis with some tropical fruit and ripe citrus in the background. The taste starts with a strong dose of orange and grapefruit citrus, pine resin, caramel and malt rounded out with some vegtetal hops bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a finish thats all citrus and resiny bitterness. Easily one of the best Fresh Hop Ales out there and another great brew from Fremont.","Seattle, Washington, USA","CampesinoTino"

4048,"2010-10-26",3.5,"Solid citra hop nose, somewhat earthy as well, plus a hint of leafy green veggies in there as well, or ferns perhaps. Citra hop aroma is nice and pleasant though. Pours golden amber with a thin bubbly head. The flavor is initially full of citra hops, somewhat earthy and dirt-y, plus a hint of leafy veggies that did not work for me. The citra is very nice however. Dry finish with hints of malt sweetness.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
