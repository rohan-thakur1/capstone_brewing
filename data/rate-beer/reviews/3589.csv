3589,"2010-08-16",3.6,"Bottled (from Alko, Vaasa). Fridge cold. Pale watery see through colour, no head. Aroma is rice, melted rubber and some slight spicy notes as well. Also quite much sweaty shoe aroma in it. Flavour is mild spices, herbs, lightly fruity as well as some ricelike notes. Hides the alcohol very well. 
Room temperatured. Same colour & no head. Aroma stays quite the same but gets the foot sweat stronger and also a stinging alcoholic peak in it. Flavour is quite much the same, but turns a bit more grassyish dry in the front palate. 
At about 70 C. Loses some of the footsweat in aroma, but alcohol comes through a bit better. Flavour gets a slightly alcoholic sting. I probably liked the aroma best when cold, the flavour probably inbetween fridgecold and room temperature.","Vasa, FINLAND","oh6gdx"
