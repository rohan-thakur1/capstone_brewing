2711,"2012-09-03",3.6,"Tap at the brewery.  Creamy smooth palate.  Taste of corn and honey.  Easy drinking.","California, USA","MattH"
2711,"2012-06-19",2.5,"Draft, Tap 42.  Golden colour and drops bright.  No head, though.  Lightly fruity, lightly grainy aroma. Tastes quite grainy.  Not much character beyond a vague malty sweetness.  Vague, bland beer that dorsnt stand out.  If youve beet forced to slug back Singha or Carlsberg for lack of serious beer choice the humour of thus will be lost on you.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
2711,"2012-06-16",3.4,"6/16/12. On tap. Clear orange pour with a small head. Light aroma of honey and corn with a parallel flavor. Clean and good for what it is.","Georgia, USA","drowland"

2711,"2012-05-25",4.1,"Pours a hazy yellow with a white head.  Nose is grain, honey, and some bread with hints of more honey and some lager.  Flavor is similar with grain and honey loaded into the front, grain in the mid, and sweet and lager in the finish.  The honey and grain blend so well into the finish that it just keeps giving flavor.  Light in body and unbelievably drinkable.  Outstanding pale lager.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
2711,"2012-05-25",3.9,"On draft at CCB, poured a clear yellow color with aromas of grain, bread, and tons of honey.  Flavor is bread, honey, clean grains, honey, and more honey.  This was a pretty nice beer where there is a ton of honey flavor, but isnt overly sweet, really nicely balanced.","Florida, USA","burg326"
2711,"2012-05-24",4.0,"On tap at CCB. Woah, such a nice lager. Nose is grainy malt, bran flakes, some light honey, and a touch of citrus. Pour is light yellow with a nice white head. Taste is, again, grainy malt and bread with a touch of sweetness and some nice hops in there. An easy drinker and very flavorful.","Florida, USA","OmegaX"
2711,"2012-05-24",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2012 This one blows the ale version away. The aroma was pure grain and honey - a lot like a fresh bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios. Carbonation was moderate, and aided the fresh bread flavors. Some nice notes of cereal, honey, citrus and with a subtle hop finish make for a great session-able beer.","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"
