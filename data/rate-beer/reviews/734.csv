734,"2015-10-06",3.5,"Bottle: &nbsp Deep caramel in color, dirty, moderate foamy off-white head, nice lacing. &nbsp Citrus and rye 

on the nose. &nbsp Smells purdy good. &nbsp Smooth on the tongue, a little citrus bitterness with the aformentioned 

rye. &nbsp Not a heavy example, somewhat light, but nice flavor and clean. &nbsp Moderate body and mouthfeel. &nbsp 

Pretty simple, but a nice citrusy bitterness with some rye.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
734,"2015-01-28",3.2,"12 oz. bottle from Brandon. Dated 10/17/14. It pours a hazy amber/dark orange color with a decent khaki head. The aroma has lots of pine and mild toffeeish, caramel malts. Some fruity berry, plum and citrus as well. The flavor has heavy pine bitterness, hop spice, thick caramel malt with a bitter, dry piney finish. Theres a dry, bready malt backbone that complements the piney hops well, but this is too bitter and caramel heavy for me.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
734,"2015-01-26",3.6,"Large sample pour of mild amber with a nce spicy nose an plenty of hops. Flavor drinks like an IPA with rye. Pretty hop forward with moderate amounts of pine and resin. Loads of resin... Plenty of spice in the finish","Florida, USA","tricyclist"

734,"2014-12-15",3.9,"Pours a dark amber with a foamy white head. Aroma is spicy rye, and flavor is similar, with a little sweetness and a lot of bitterness. Very good.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","chucklemation"
734,"2014-12-03",2.9,"Bottle. The pour is a lighter red with full head. The aroma is mostly mild hops. The taste is a little too bitter hops, a lot of carbonation, kinda fizzy.

734,"2014-11-15",3.6,"bottle. Brown with one finger head. Malty with moderate rye and quite a bit of bitter, piney hops.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","rumproasts"
734,"2014-11-14",3.7,"12oz bottle via ICEatALAMO and the Mystery Box BIF. Pours a murky, deep amber with lots of creamy, lacing white head. Nose has a lot of bright orange, tangerine, honey comb, bread notes, piney too. Flavor hits you with strong pine, grapefruit, orange, the honey in the nose has turned to candy, the malt finally comes through, pithy, a little soapy too. Hints of pepper on the tongue. Finishes medium bodied, bitter.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
734,"2014-11-13",3.9,"12oz bottle, big thanks to my buddy umich03jm. Poured into my DFH IPA glass. Fantastic label art and name -- Shorts keeps on outdoing themselves in this regard. Hazy red - brown color. Finger of light khaki head, with good retention. Leaves good bigger ridges of lace and reaches of lace. 5 for appearance because I cant imagine how it could look better. Great spicy rye aroma in the nose. Some chocolate notes in the flavor. Very nice complex malt bill. Less spicy than your typical red rye ale, more balanced and nuanced. Good mild pine, some tropical fruit. Medium plus body. Smooth, kind of soft, creamy, lighter carbonation. Light slick texture. Moderate sweet taste, moderate bitter. Wonderful hopped up but balanced and not too bitter rye ale. No complaints. Super-balanced. Satisfying amount of both rye and hop, without being too bitter, nor too spicy. Magical.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
734,"2014-11-12",3.6,"Clear amber pour. Spicy rye hops and sweet malts in the aroma. Taste has lots of spicy rye along with bready malt, pine and resin with a nice bitter finish. An enjoyable brew.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","fattybladdy"
734,"2014-11-09",3.9,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, bottled on 10/17/2014. Pours moderately hazy/cloudy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with some light streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, caramel, spicy rye, toasted bread, floral, grass, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, caramel, spicy rye, toasted bread, floral, grass, pine, and floral/grassy earthiness. Good amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness and rye spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon/orange peel, pine, caramel, spicy rye, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and fairly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice rye IPA! All around good complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical hops and moderate dark/bready malt sweetness; and very smooth and crisp to sip on. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
734,"2014-11-05",3.3,"Bottle: Oily pour, slick looking body. Dense copper, slightly brown. Very muddled, nearly opaque in the glass with a huge, semi-creamy, foamy ecru cap that lasts for ages leaving heaps of lacing along the glass. Aroma is a quad-stomp of zesty floral notes, slightly spicy toasted rye, crispy citrus peel, & undertones of moderately sweet caramel malts. Somewhat juicy, yet zesty, leafy, & mildly spicy all at once. Flavor is much more rye forward. Lots of spicy rye notes & toasted, burnt bread crust. Hints of caramel malt with pepper covered grapefruit & bitter orange rind. Mild hints of flowers, leaves, & ashy hops intensify bitterness towards the finish, which balances the finishing notes of toasty rye, citrus, & caramel malt. Mouth feel is actually a bit more viscous than expected for the style... Wonder what the ""specialty"" malts are? Ill be the first to admit that I dont usually love rye beers, but this one was pretty good. I prefer this to Rye Not.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

734,"2014-11-01",3.6,"Bottle to pint. Looks good for the style; a fairly transparent dark (almost brownish) orange with foamy head that is a very light caramel color. Smells hoppy and spicy with a nice bittersweet malt backbone. Tastes like it smells with some citrus notes and a medium-bodied mouthfeel. Enjoyable.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
734,"2014-11-01",4.3,"This beer was made for me! Think of some seeded hearty beefsteak bread ""buttered"" with what I assume are centennial hops. Ready for some corn beef. Should be the new beer of st. Pattys day.","livonia, Michigan, USA","mallons72"
734,"2014-10-31",3.6,"Bottle: The aroma consists of light-moderate rye, citrus, caramel, and grapefruit. It pours a hazy dark orangish-brown with a one finger off-white that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a soapy ring. There is a good dose of soapy webbing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with a quick dose of caramel and a touch of fruit. The finish has moderate grapefruit, rye, and some light herbal hops. Its light-medium bodied with light-moderate carbonation.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
734,"2014-10-29",3.9,"A dark dark orange color with a bubble filled darker off white head. A heavy rye citrus filled aroma. At first sip a ton of rye flavors are covering the mouthfeel. A big rye bready note mixed in. A nice citrus hopped flavor comes in the end making it a nice drinkable brew. An all around nice rye flavor.","Michigan, USA","SpongeRuiner"
734,"2014-10-28",3.9,"Bottle. Deep cloudy tangerine orange-brown body, thick clumping cream head. Nose potent with layers of bitter, spicy pine duff and toasty malts with light sweetness. Complex, rich body with spicy, piny hops bite and swirls of citrus peel, resins, and a sticky, toasty/caramely malt backbone. Lingering bitter citrusy finish. Very good beer.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
