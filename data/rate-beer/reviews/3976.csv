3976,"2016-10-10",4.4,"Bottle from Sprouts: Poured a dark brown liquid and was topped with a fluffy foam cap head. Aroma is decked with scents of fresh hop that bring on notes of citrus fruit peel, onion and a touch of rye bread. Very subtle drinking beer that only after swallowing does the flavor become more apparent. Taste is slightly bitter but brings about sweetness from the strong backbone of dark malts added.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"
3976,"2016-07-24",3.1,"Deep dark brown coloured body with a thick tan head. Aroma of roasted malt, alcohol, deep hops, earth, caramel and a hint of molasses. Medium to Full-bodied; Deep robust earthy malt with a lot of caramelised sugars, some pungent earthy and floral hops and a big bite of alcohol. Aftertaste shows the decently balanced malt and hops with a bit too much bitterness, some assertive alcohol and roasted malt and a touch of grain and lactose on the finish. Overall, a decent Imperial Black IPA, with nothing making this great nor a must sample. I sampled this 65 cL bottle purchased from Whole Foods in Fair Lakes (Fairfax), Virginia on 04-February-2016 for US$9,99 sampled at home in Upstate New York (New Paltz) on 22-July-2016.

3976,"2016-05-04",4.7,"With an Enjoy By date of 5.4.16, today was a very appropriate day to crack open the blackened version of Stones much-loved Enjoy By IPA. Given Stones emphasis on this sort of thing, its fair to guess this was the freshest Black IPA Ive tasted. I know it was the most beautiful. Black body and a tight head that sparkles. Im not trying to be hyperbolic or cute. The foam really does glisten. Aromas of roasted malt, woodsy pine, herbal tobacco, zesty citrus, and a hint of smoke. Bright, juicy grapefruit flavors with sappy pine needles and subtler touches of cocoa, caramel, and coffee. Texture is oily and somewhat thick. For what can be a pretty aggressive style, Enjoy By Black is relatively mellow. Lovely.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Aroma is an impressively strong and pleasant ruby red grapefruit. Flavor is ruby red grapefruit, some tropical fruit, and pithy bitterness. This is a good beer, though I like Self Righteous a little better because of its better integration of roasted malts into the flavor of the beer.","California, USA","MattH"

3976,"2016-03-05",3.9,"One of the five (!) beers that Matt bought back from San Diego. Very dark ruby-brown, light beige sudsy head. Smells of moderate roast malt, heavy toasty, dusty hop. Tastes of roast malt, somewhat acidic coffee, heavy stony bitterness, mildly burnt and lemony finish. Body is very smooth, a bit chewy, slightly sharp then becomes stony and bitter. Less dark than most black IPAs, but plenty of bitterness and a lightly coffee roastiness. Had this 3 weeks after its Enjoy By date but didn't taste unfresh. Very nice.","HONG KONG","CacheManyHose"
3976,"2016-03-05",4.1,"Best before 2.14.16 drank nearly 3 weeks after. Oh well. Bottle from SD at home in HK. Dark cola brown-black pour with thick slightly tan (off white) head. Aroma is big pine resin hops with a little bit of roasted coffee grounds, but much more hop-forward. Still really enticing. Taste is big resiny bitterness with a lot of alcohol too. The roasted flavors of a black IPA only come at the end, with a bit more coffee and then lasting bitter resin and booze. Had lowered my expectations based on other reviews but this is delicious, even if less roasted than expected for a black IPA.","HONG KONG","HKdIPA"
3976,"2016-02-27",3.4,"Bomber. Grapefruit hop aroma with pine resiny hop notes and only a little bit of roast. Pours black with a large tan head with excellent retention but poor lacing. Starts with grape fruit hops as well as a bit of roast. Finishes dry with grapefruit citrus and acidity as well as strong bitter pine resiny hops. Not bad, but not a lot of roast contrast for a black IPA. Will try again next iteration.","","zoucrew102"

The aroma offers up tangelo, grapefruit and almost candy like sweet clementine as well as thin slivers of dark roasted malts and chocolate malts. The taste delivers rich dark roasted malts surrounded by a sea of bitter and slightly juicy grapefruit and tangerine like citrus hoppiness. The dark roasted malts take on a thin soft chocolate edge to midway before giving way to a growing bitter to near resiny hoppiness heading into the finish. Solid.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Damn, the gnats that have been plaguing me like paparazzi love this, too! No wonder, since the hoppy, woody aroma reaches out and touches you from half a meter away. Closer in, you capture roast malt and licorice tones. Formidable flavor presents woody hop, hay, roast malt, coffee, toffee and licorice tones. A deep, dark wonder indeed - I really love black IPAs. Mouthfeel features firm body, plenty of fizz, and a hoppy and roast malt/coffee finish. Im enjoying the 2/14/16 version on 2/15/16, but hey, I tend to be fashionably late.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"

Black pour with a beige head. Some streaky lace. Aroma has citrus and pine and black malts. Taste is of grapefruit, salty tangy black malts, some roast, some chewy resin and a touch of soy. Blend is very well done. Medium bodied. A bit lowly carbonated with almost no alcohol presence. Finishes more bitter than bittersweet. Roasty, tangy. A very good example for style - no surprise from Stone, and especially fresh Stone. 14.8","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"

Pours fairly clear very dark brown color with a 2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, papaya, passion fruit, mango, melon, berry, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper, pine, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate roasted malt notes; with great strength.

Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate roasted malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero astringent hop flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness that increases through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, sticky, and lightly creamy/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic Black DIPA!

3976,"2016-01-24",4.0,"This beer was so awesome to review. Its super interesting and ended up being incredible. Im not the biggest fan of black ipas. Most of the ones Ive had end up being more malt and roast forward and miss out on big pungent hoppiness. I love that this beer smelled like a fresh squeezed grapefruit and looks like a stout. Its weird in a cool way. The aroma is super aromatic with big grapefruit and dankness. Super fresh which is what makes it so good. Taste is like a big grapefruit with subtle roasted undertones. I think what makes it work so well is the big sweet roasted malts cut by the massive hops. And the right hops at that. The perfect combo of hops made this beer what it was, which I think makes a huge difference in black ipas. Overall its excellent and looks like it should be big and chewy and its a citrus bomb.

You cant tell whats coming next. The one thing that is clear is that this is a very fresh beer. Even though I broke the rules and waited until after the enjoy by date, this is still hella fresh. Although this looks black in a big glass, its actually just barely a crystal clear dark brown topped with a very light tan head. Expecting a blast of bitterness, I get exactly what I expect, except that its incredibly well balanced. Theres pretty much all of the hop aromas in the taste and its all spicy bitter goodness. Just when its about to overwhelm, the dark roasted malt kicks in with milk and dark chocolate and maybe a touch of molasses. The sweetness that comes with this does an admirable job of balancing the bitter onslaught, but in the end the hops win. The alcohol comes around the back to blast all that bitterness home. In the end, its a bitter, chocolaty hot mess. And I love it.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"

FLAVOR of big juicy fruity hops (tropical and stone fruit), tangerine, grapefruit, pine tar...the roasted malt does make itself known here with lesser notes of chocolate and caramel. But the roastiness does not linger...finishes more like a DIPA than a Black IPA with the hops winning big over the malt. Blindfolded, I would never have guessed the color of this beer based on the aroma alone. Despite the coloring, expect lots of big dominating hops in this one. Really good.

3976,"2015-10-28",4.0,"Immediate waft of classic enjoy by hops, pines, resin, hop oils and dankness. Thereafter comes deep cocoa, chocolate, toasted nuts, brown sugar, toffee and slight licorice. Pours pitch black with a decent foam head. Taste is heavy bitterness, resin, dankness and hops accompanied by decadent dark malts, toffee, chalky cocoa nibs, dark grain malt and bitter chocolate. Finishes absurdly dry with residual hop oils and resin. Some subtle notes of tangerine, grapefruit juice and orange dance around the palate. Overall, dank, dark and delicious as expected from Stone. The dark components are definitely present but the hops definitely steal the show on this. A rating.","Los Angeles, CA, California, USA","Thisis12ptfont"
3976,"2015-10-24",3.9,"On draft at Stone. Dark chestnut brown pour, near black., with a light tan head. Dank, resinous hops, some tropical fruit, hop juice, bitter, some toffee sweetness, mild roasted barley, and lots of pine. Overall dry, super hoppy, and resinous. If blind tasting this, it would be difficult to tell it was black.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
