1587,"2012-04-14",2.0,"UPDATED: MAY 6, 2012 I was happy when I first found this stuff - a big bottle of unfiltered sake at a modest price.  But my happiness soon turned to a very different emotion.  Milky white pour and alcoholic aroma.  One sip and . . . woo boy.  This is without question the sweetest sake I have ever had - it tastes like it has several scoops of sugar added to the bottle.  Is the chalky, soda pop-like quality due to the fact that it is American made?  Like soda, it is awful when warm, but drinkable when served cold.  I had trouble getting it down on its own, so I began mixing it with cheap beer (a trick I picked up from a pan-Asian restaurant) and that works out all right.  Much to my amazement this is getting good ratings!  Maybe the problem is that I am not used to nigori, or it just is not the sake style for me.  Note: I began to appreciate this stuff more toward the end of the bottle.  It is very sweet for sake, and it takes a little time to begin accepting it.","USA","Slipstream"

1587,"2011-03-18",3.7,"Looks like coconut milk in the glass with some sediment on the side of the glass when swished around, could this sediment be the sake version of lacing? The aroma has floral, fruity, & white oak notes but suffers from a clear presence of cheap vodka like booziness. The flavor is next to stunning, on the sweet side but miles from cloying fruity flavors of strawberry and pear are the most clearly identifiable. The mild heat from the alcohol seems to create a sort of spicy sensation that is very nice. The sake displays a nice earthiness and the alcohol (at least in the flavor) is about as well concealed as any great sake Ive sampled.

1587,"2007-08-19",3.6,"375 mL bottle.  Pours a very cloudy white color, almost like skim milk, leaving a bit of residue on the sides of the glass.  Generous aroma: toasted rice, some sweet fruitiness, and a slight show of alcohol.  Silky smooth mouthfeel: dense rice and toasty vanilla character; creamy, milky presence filling the mouth; very minimal alcohol; toasty and round in the mouth, with a bit of an oily, nutty note.  Lengthy, rice hulls and doughy finish.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
1587,"2007-08-18",2.9,"375ml bottle. Very cloudy pour. Aroma is somewhat sweet but mostly not evident. Starts out ricey and quickly becomes sickly, cloyingly sweet in the mouth, and not in a good way. A large amount of cheap fruitiness. Think sake mixed with frat-party fruit punch. The alcohol is there too. My throat is really rather warm. Kind of peanuty, though, as it warms, which is interesting.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
1587,"2007-07-03",3.5,"Im far from a sake expert, but I love this stuff.  Milky white unfiltered appearance.  Aroma is rice, vanilla, sweet milk, and alcohol.  Taste is very sweet.  Body is silky smooth.  Ive had it several times and the finish is hit or miss.  Sometimes its smooth and sometimes its a bit chalky.  There are also textural inconsistencies between bottles.  Overall very good, especially with spicy sushi.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
1587,"2007-07-02",2.7,"39th & CambieMilky appearance.  Balsa, starch, a bit of glue and some rough alcohol on the nose.  Very sweet...almost candyish.  Smooth and soft.  A little bit of alcohol comes in late, but thats okay because without it this would be rice pudding.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1587,"2007-05-27",2.8,"my first sake.  pours an opaque cream color.  looks like milk.  aroma is of vanilla, banana, vodka,  white russian.  palate is thick and creamy.  flavor is very sweet.  leaves a chalky feeling in your mouth.  very warming.","","SSSteve"

1587,"2007-04-17",3.2,"Bottle from Degarth; Nose of rice graininess and alcohol; Milky white color; flavor of strong alcohol with light coconut milk and sweetness.","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
1587,"2007-02-13",2.2,"The aroma is earthy with lots of alcohol, air freshener/cleaner, wood, milk, and sugar. The appearance is like coconut milk. The flavor is sweet and spicy hot with plenty of the menagerie from the aroma. The palate is thin but ok for a sake. This stuff also tastes like rice. No surprise there. Maybe I just cant appreciate this kind of sake. On a side note, this gets better as it warms to room temperature and the alcohol in this will get you numb so be warned.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
1587,"2006-10-23",3.3,"Chilled bottle. Poured white color with legs. Moderate melons, coconut and alcohol aroma. Light to medium body with unfiltered particles. Medium sweet pear and rice flavor with medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Much better than my expectations.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1587,"2006-10-14",3.3,"Pours creamy white and milky. Aroma is sweet and fruity. Coconut and floral silkiness embody the taste and the mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy. Quite delicious with sushi.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","TheBeerOrg"

1587,"2006-08-16",2.4,"UPDATED: OCT 25, 2008 Bottled. Pours a white, watered down milky color. Sweet aroma of horchata and coconut. Tasted a lot like a TGIF pina colada, when you drink it straight from the bottle.","La Mesa, California, USA","mjg74"
1587,"2006-08-16",3.3,"much better then the first of this style. Cloudy white body no little rice particales could be seen.  not much of an aroma, but a nice creamy and fruity flavor. seemed to be rather delicate.  really easy to drink.","New York, USA","crazyvin"
1587,"2006-07-29",3.6,"Cloudy body due to the unfiltering that leads to a milky-white body.  Light alcohol on the nose, as well as some floral accents, maybe some coconut.  Fruity taste, banana, coconut, grape, well blended and the alcohol is concealed nicely.  Good ending burn.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Numenor"
1587,"2006-07-29",3.4,"Slightly chilled and shaken. Cloudy white color. Sweet aroma with hints of vanilla. Very sweet flavor, hints of vanilla and light rice, somewhat creamy.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","maniac"
1587,"2006-05-20",3.2,"355 ml bottle.  Tried this in all three of the suggested serving methods.  Room temp, chilled, and on the rocks.  Milky white in color.  Aromas were similar no matter what.  Vanilla, coconut, banana.  Even some alcohol on the nose.  Flavors were the most varied with the different serving methods.  Room temp was a lot more alcohol  tremendous heat on the finish.  Strong all the way through.  Banana and coconut still in there, as well as that flavor that is in the middle of a Cadbury Creme Egg.  Chilled was similar, but the alcohol was toned down tremendously.  I could still taste it, but it didnt burn as much.  On the rocks was my favorite.  The ice melted and really made this more drinkable.  The Alcohol burn and flavor was reduced, and all the other flavors were still there although muted a touch.  Not bad for my first Sake.","Santee/San Diego, California, USA","fordest"
1587,"2006-04-04",3.0,"As my first attempt at a Nigori Sake, I was overwhelm on how different it is. Its a silky, almost creamy texture with a hint of coconut taste and aroma. Goes down smooth with a sweet taste.  Sediment adds some texture.
Defentily a first for me!","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
1587,"2006-03-31",3.6,"nice skim milk appearance.  fruity alcoholic nose, coconuts.  vanilla pudding on the palate with bit of alcohol ember below. smooth, sweet, and good. only $4 for this bottle.","Henderson, Nevada, USA","bitter"
1587,"2006-02-26",3.6,"Served cold.  Milky white color, looks like watered down milk, with some small suspended particles.  Sweet aroma of melon and alcohol.  The flavor is different than other sakes Ive had - very sweet but very good.  Tastes like sweet rice (rice pudding maybe).  I enjoy the thicker mouthfeel, and the finish is nice and sweet.  This is my first Nigori sake, and I think I like it more than the other sake styles Ive tried.","Portland, Oregon, USA","BobbyW3363"
1587,"2006-01-23",3.6,"Pearl white with sweet rice, light melon, and a touch of flowers.  Thick mouthfeel and sweetish taste.  Rice pudding, tapioca, smooth and thick but not cloying.","Yokosuka, JAPAN","Marc"
1587,"2005-05-17",3.1,"Ive been drinking sake for a while now, and I didnt realize it was in the ratebeer database!  This is very exciting.  Id heard good things about nigori sake...  I wasnt disappointed, but God!  this stuff is sweet!  Its the strangest milky-white color Ive ever seen.  Its like the Hefeweizen of sake.  I guess its more of a Hefe-rice-n though (get it?)  OK.  Im retarded.  But Im going to be rating a lot more sake in the near future.  Sayonara, fools!","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Fish"
1587,"2005-05-08",2.9,"Nearly opaque white color, rather unappetizing.  Sweet, lightly fruity, with alcohol in the nose.  Alcohol much stronger in this than others I had last night.  Faint fruitiness, thick.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"

1587,"2005-04-12",2.6,"Cloudy translucent appearance, like extremely skim milk. Coconut aroma. Strong sweetness (almost too sweet, must be sipped slowly) with a very slight alcohol bite. Lingering fruit tastes and surprisingly pleasing for the price.","Nampa, Idaho, USA","IdahoJizake"

1587,"2004-12-17",2.9,"As always pleased to be able to sample a sake.  This is my first unfiltered sake.  Honorable mention to Kroger, they are actually carrying this in a regular grocery store!  We are living in a golden age for distribution.  Cloudy, looks like watered down skim milk.  Distinct aroma of coconut and some alcohol.  Flavor matches.  Alcohol is clearly present and not altogether smooth.  Smooth out the alcohol and I can see how this style could really rock.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
1587,"2004-11-28",3.1,"Served ice cold at Kitcho Japanese Restaurant in Tallahassee. Pours a cloudy white with puffy flumes when poured into the glass. Aroma of cocnuts and light citrus. Mouthfeel is rather pleasnt, slightly creamy. Flavor has some pineapple and coconut notes and reminds me a little bit of a pina colada. Good companion to sushi and stir fry.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"

1587,"2004-08-17",3.1,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2006 Thanks to Bück Dich for recomending this to a sake newbie. Shaken and poured into a tulip. Funky, watery milk appearance. The smells are sweet with coconuts, bananas and a background of alcohol. The taste is also sweet, almost like a peach milkshake. Has notes of wood and mango in the finish. Gets a little more sour as it warms. A refreshing and interesting option.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

1587,"2004-04-13",3.6,"Cloudy white appearance. Aroma is pineapples and coconut. Flavor is slightly sour with some coconuts and pineapples present. There is a slight alcohol burn noticeable.

1587,"2004-04-12",2.6,"Thick milky ""watered down milk"" white color with a tinge of yellow and an oily slick on the surface. The aroma is very fruity and sweet with some pineapple and wood and a little creamyness mixed with the alcohol. There is a very large sweet impact with some alcohol notes in the tail. Tangy mouthfeel with some citrus presence. This has a surprising sweet flavor (-20!) and a long linger finish that isn't exceptional.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
