1446,"2017-01-06",1.7,"750ml bottle (Alus Celle, Riga)
Well, the first 250ml of the bottle looked like a pile of froth all over the sink and bathroom floor, this was a pretty lively gusher. Automatic -1 to look for gushers. And of course this has made it all yeasty so it looks like a turbid muddy puddle. Did have a nice tight head though, with reasonable persistence. But a turd with sprinkles is still a turd with sprinkles (except when its nicki minaj). Slightly sour, and really yeasty aroma, some bread yeast. Behind that theres a hint of a toasty roast, but thats playing third fiddle. Sharp the second it hits the tongue, eww, thats sour. Dirty yeast also dominates the taste. Palate is fizzy, predictably, and with that sour bite. Complete mess. Jesters are piss takers, no? I can see why they call themselves Jester King, as this is the king of piss-takes. If only I had a shitty russian pale lager, I could take the taste of this out of my mouth. World class bad, 1.7 seems like an over-rate, but Ill take a few more sips, and things could change. Oh, this is *nothing* like an Alt. Bullshit Artists.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
