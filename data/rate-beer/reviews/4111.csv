4111,"2016-05-13",5.0,"Pour from a mystical 750 mL bottle that ""doesnt really exist unless your name is Schramm."" Batch 4. Never thought Id ever get to try this. The pour is a deep, rich blood color. Straight from the femoral. It looks like a liquid ruby. Syrupy and heavy. Damn. The aroma is like intercourse. There is the presence from the cherries, the raspberry is present and subtle, but presents a light sweetness with the honey. The currants are exceptionally deep and complex throughout this. There is a hint of booze on the back end. But it belongs. The balance and complexity of this is unbelievable. The flavor is well... Fuck me running. The cherry really pops right into your mouth. The raspberry is there for solid backup and a little sweetness to get it going. The currant offers a whole different level of complexity. This thing is constantly changing and morphing from the moment it touches your lips. There is a light booziness that wanders in and out of the spotlight, and just ties this all together. The mouth feel is thick and heavy with a glorious complex sweet, fruity, booziness on the back end. This is just liquid sex. Son of a bitch.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Appearance: Beautiful deep vibrant ruby red that leaves nice legs on the glass. 

Aroma: Burst of currants and black cherries alongside honey, floral/tea presence, light cinnamon / nutmeg, jammy fruits and port character. 

Taste: Sweet, but perfectly balanced by the moderate acidity. Burst of cherries and currants alongside deep honey presence, floral notes, light nutmeg, a touch of alcohol and port notes.

Palate: Full body. Thick. Mouth coating. Syrupy. Warming finish. Lingering fruity sweetness. Fruity finish and aftertaste. Perfect! 

Overall: One of the tastiest beverage I have ever had. So rich! The fruit presence is massive, but also really well balanced by a perfectly dosed acidity and a wonderful honey depth.

The tall glass bottle pours with a deep purple body that has rosy red edges and leaves behind slightly staining swirls and decent legginess. The aroma offers up thick berry notes before it heads into some dark currant goodness and a dash of honey wax. The taste smoothly flows into rich dark currant juiciness, berry richness and then a bit of tannin like tartness. The tartness seems to try and break up the rich deep berry goodness but is unable to. This starts to pick up currant berry earthiness toward the finish but the tannic tartness snuffs it out. This was surprisingly different than the batches from the B.

Rich berry presence, raspberry and blackberry, gentle black cherry. Touches of honey, mellow sweetness, tannic berry skin. Honey, green and red apple, gentle florals and earth. Wow, rich and complex. Initial is apple, raspberry, blackberry and gentle tartness. Some black cherry, gentle honey, some some tannic berry skin, raspberry, touches of cherry, honey, and apple. Some good berry, raspberry pulpy fruit, some blackberry, black cherry. Really a nice melange. Backend is a touch more honey, apple, some gentle tannic and fruit skin elements, faint clover and florals. Black currant, touches of sweetness, seedy and decent sweetness. Finish is a bit sweet, berry driven. Nice stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
4111,"2013-10-12",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2015 Bottle @ Schramms: Rosy red and crimson, dark body with wine-like legging. Aroma is huge & sweet. Sweet, juicy cherries, red wine grapes, mild raspberry, light touch of wood and some faint cocoa notes. Taste is very sweet but controlled - literally no sign of alcohol at all. No heat. Fresh, decadent raspberries, black cherries, dates, grapes, super sweet with a honey aftertaste. Worth 100$ for a 375 mL bottle? Probably not, but this is a truly awesome mead. Pure art in edible liquid form.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
