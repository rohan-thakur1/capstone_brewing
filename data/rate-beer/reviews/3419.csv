3419,"2017-04-14",4.0,"2016 Bottling: 10.9%

10.9% ABV. Barrel-aged red/sour.

Poured out deep amber. 16 SRM.

Nose is sour and fruity with some wood and maybe a faint wet hay. On first approach suggestive of a saison or farmhouse style, but on further reflection theres not that funkiness, no manure or wet clay. Wine and vinegar in the nose.

Mouthfeel is watered honey. Syrupy. Palate has fruitiness with sour and sweet. Wood with broad oakiness. The cherry flavor is fruity with no candy and more body. Hops if any are woody.

Finish is surprisingly clean given the vintage of this brew.","SINGAPORE","drjoeng"

Definitely a beer that should be had a cellar temp, it really opens up once out of fridge temp. This is a tough style to do well and this is definitely a sold offering.

The pour is a nice ruby copper color with a thin tan head and a light soapy lace as it falls. The aroma is big time wine up front. There is a lighter, yet still decently sour, cherry that begins to roll in. There is a lactic acid that comes into play over the oak and its pretty good. Not great, but decent. The flavor is much of the same. There is a lot of woodiness. The lactic cherry begins to shine through, but its just a little messy. There is a stronger malt than I was expecting here. The mouth feel is a little softer than youd expect. There is a brighter carbonation and a lingeringly lactic cherry and wine-soaked wood.

3419,"2017-01-28",4.5,"Aside from some notable exceptions, Flanders-style Oud Bruins tend to be a bit of a stumbling block for American brewers. There ARE great examples brewed in the states, but too often the effort seems to be phoned in or messy, even by seasoned brewers. The Dissident is anything but a half-assed obligatory release. This red-brown beer is extraordinarily complex. Theres barnyard, cherry, wood, caramel and citrus tones. It has a bright sourness, but it isnt overwhelming. Some earthy funk, yet theres some fruity and malty sweetness. Youre left with a gorgeously detailed representation of a niche style.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

3419,"2016-01-23",3.4,"Bottle, shared by me... in my dining room... just now.
Pours a deep reddish orange, sort of rust like color with a fluffy off white head and some lacing on the glass.

The aroma is certainly inviting with plenty of tart cherry, earthy funk, and wood galore. It absolutely comes off as boozy in the aroma, which is really the downfall to the bouquet here considering all the pleasantries. 

The flavor is nice but far far too wood forward at this age (2015 bottling)... The sourness is restrained and pleasant, there is almost no detectable acetic character, its reasonably dry & its got a good tart cherry thing happening. But damn if it isnt boozy. The overwhelming wood & booze just really are put offs for me with this beer, scale those two things back and this is an out of the park flanders red, but its really hard to dig past the dominance of those two flavors & the whole thing ends up hot and unbalanced. 

This is a beer Ive waited to try for easily 5+ years, Im not wholly disappointed, but I was hoping for something... different. 
Would it age well? Probably, but Im not paying another $17 to find out.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

3419,"2016-01-10",4.0,"2014 bottle. It says best after ""10/27/15.""
This was poured into a tulip. 
The appearance was a semi-hazy to burnt amber color with a quickly dissipating fizzy white head that left no lacing.
The smell had some sour cherries up front with a subtle sweetness to it. Light woody character rounds it out. Subtle acceptable vinous grapes.
The flavor rides on the sour cherries with the woodiness coming back dryly. Sticky sweet cherry to woody aftertaste leads into the finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sipping to sessionable quality about it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the stickiness to build on my tongue, still acceptable for the most part. 
Overall, I say this was a pretty nicely done Flanders Oud Bruin that I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Pours a murky copper beer, head quickly dissipates.
Complex, suitably funky aroma; bruised apple, brown sugar, sultana, cherry stone, almond, toasty vanillin oakiness, bit of Bretty barnyard funk, overly ripe stonefruits - I could go on...
Body surprisingly not too rich for its strength, mild acidity cuts through, yet still long on the palate, somewhat sticky, low carbonation.
Very unique, theres so much going on here - sour cherry, peach nectar, rich barley wine-like maltiness, treacle, sultana, prune, toasty oak, butter, barynyard funk. Tannic, slightly sour, slightly warming, somewhat bitter finish.
Remarkable beer, something very different & unique.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Pours amber with a cherry hue, etched surface with a rim of light cream foam. The smell was evident from a couple feet upon pouring - really richly cherry this year. There are notes of lacto, breat and oak with plenty of the wine character coming through and lots of nice, tart cherries. The flavor is tart up front with a bit of heat and plenty of cherry flavor. This is really remarkable in that it is very, very fruit forward and most in the style that Ive had are more oak balanced. I think I prefer this approach. The tartness is not quite sour per se, but is richly enhancing the overall tone of the beer. There is much, much less wood and grain perceived this year than 2010 when fresh. Medium on light syrup body with limited, soft and fine carb with a watering finish. Nice beer. I am really glad I got a good stash of this vintage.

3419,"2013-10-20",3.9,"Sampled at GABF. Impressed by this. Ugly, light pale brown color. Smells quite sour, but the flavor is surprisingly mellow. The sourness is a participant here, but not the only thing going on. The brown ale canvas is allowed a little room to express itself with a touch of sweetness. The oak also comes in and plays, which is something I don't see too often, even in wood aged sours. While some sourheads may see this beer as too tame, I really appreciated tasting a sour beer that used sour flavors as a contributor to a beer with a diversity of flavors.

3419,"2013-01-14",3.3,"2008 vintage, poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip.  From notes.

Dissident comes out of the bottle with an aggressive carbonation, creating a large, fizzy, beige head on top of a scarlet ruby beer that has a tarnished, fading look to it.

The aroma is a blend of tart cherries, lemon, with a general funky note stepping in front of more subdued vanilla and oaky notes.  Some red grape and red wine notes add a little bit of depth.

Normally with a well-made beer that is aged in wine barrels I like to taste a distinct series of flavors.  Unfortunately, that is not really the case here.  The flavors seem to be somewhat muddled.  Tart cherries combine with slightly acidic vinous fruit, lemon, oak, and some cherry vinegar.  It lacks the punch of fruit that I would hope for, and instead it seems like a messy blend of sour beer and wine barrels.

The beer is overcarbonated and fizzy, which clearly detracts from the experience.  The body is light and flat.  Both of these notes cause me to think the Brett may have simply been at work too long on this beer.  The acidity at a medium level for the style.

Combining the light, flat body with the intense carbonation and faded color, and I cannot help but wonder if this bottle has simply past its prime.  With four years or so on the bottle, it would not totally surprise me, although I would have expected it to hold out longer than it has.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

3419,"2012-10-20",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 12, 2014 Updated sample 19 months old, and after the ""best after date. Pours a medium, clear brown color, with a modest sour ale aroma with hints of wine and cherries (all these developed well with age; improved). Taste is mildly sour with an underlying malt sweetness with moderate complexity, nice complexity for a sour ale (I think complexity increased with time). Touch of wood notes and wine, but its subtle. This is sort of a less sour, less intense, less complex version of Collage to me, although I think it is aging possibly better than Collage. Very balanced between sour ale and sweeter malt flavor. Mouthfeel has improved with time, more substantial. Finishes with a mild lingering sourness, malt, bitterness, and wood notes. Overall this is an interesting and enjoyable sour ale, that really is best after a year or more in the cellar. I prefer this over most sours. Not sure its better than a Rodenbach Grand Cru, which is less expensive.  Its worth aging a couple, and also to see how it tastes after 3 years or so.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"

3419,"2012-10-11",3.5,"22oz bottle picked up from the brewery. 2012 vintage. Consumed 10/5, reviewed from notes.

A: Fizzy lifting drink. Decently hard pour yields a quickly fading head. Dark cider colored copper.

N: Potent - dont even have to put my nose to the glass to smell. Very vinous with the red wine grapes. Plenty of oak and tannins. Pleasant funk from the vinegar/acetone. This smells much more like an Oud Bruin than the 2010. Lots of cherries and some leather.

T:Taste falls short of the nose, and when its cold, its really non-descript, unlike any other beer Ive had. Cherry cola. Sourness level is about medium. As this warm, it gets better. Oak, cranberry, and blueberry. Sherry starts to shine, as does the French Oak. 

M: On the heavier side for an oud bruin, but still in range. No alcohol burn. 

O: I feel like the 2008 is a vintage not to be matched ever again. Hoping the yeast eats some of the sugars and gives this more depth. And a big warning about drinking this less than cool.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

A: The appearance is very clear, with the entire vessel filled with rapid effervescence. The color is amber, with hints of ruby when held to the light. There is about an inch of head that leaves a thin sheet of lacing on the glass as it fades.

S: Wonderful aromas of cherries, funk, barrels (wood), wild yeast, earthiness. The Dissident smells like a delicious Flanders Oud Bruin.

T: And...The Dissident tastes like a delicious Flanders Oud Bruin. This beer is wonderful. The flavors work amazingly well in conjunction with each other, creating a complex masterpiece of flavors to include, sour cherries, wild yeast, funk, bread, oak. The beer has a slight tannic quality and is fairly acetic, neither of which I particularly mind, but these aspects of the beer will wear on the palate as you delve deeper into the bottle.

M: The feel is very nice, with the 9% abv disguised beautifully. The beer has a medium body, and creates a subtle puckering and warming sensation at the conclusion of each sip.

The beer was a cloudy, dark amber-orange color with light, noticeable sediment, and a massive foamy and creamy light tan head that had long-lasting retention and light cling.  The beer had a rich sour cherry aroma with a mixture of caramel malt and earthy hops, along with a floral component.  Its taste was quite flavorful with a very subtle sweet effect, but mostly featured a sour fruity and cherry taste.  The body of the beer was very creamy, rich, and full, with a good level of carbonation with slight fizz and was mostly wet and silky.

3419,"2011-07-11",2.9,"2010 Vintage. When the bottle is first opened, you are immediately hit with this sharp pungency of fresh cherries. This aroma rapidly turns into a bit of a cherry cough syrup type scent, and then once poured the lacto begins to take over with hints of unripe cherries. There is a slight hint of vanilla in there (which Im guessing is from the oak) as well as a nice forest quality, like fresh grass or the inside of a forest on a sunny day.

The taste is quite surprising, especially when compared to the 2008 vintage. Its sour, but only slightly and its sourness is masked by quite a bit of residual sweetness. There is a lot of dark cherry flavored, with some chocolate coming through as well. A bit of harshness comes from the wood and it is still quite boozy. I think that over time this will turn into something beautiful, but for now it is complex but a bit disoriented feeling. It finishes very much like cough syrup and burns for quite some time.","Oregon, USA","mattdev"

3.5 A: Opaque amber brown color. Came with a small, frothy beige head. Retention wasnt too great and little lacing was left.

4.0 S: Funky and more tart than sour. Lots of fruitiness with focus on cherry, plum, and maybe some grape and peach as well. Earthy, dank funkiness.

4.5 T: Again, good funky - earthy, sweat sock type funkiness. Lots of cherry, plum, and tangy lactic acid fruitiness. Moderate tannic astringency. Light oak and a decent amount of vanilla.

4.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Pleasantly creamy and super smooth.

Appearance:  Pours a deep auburn with a fluffy beige head that subsides to nothing within minutes of entering the glass.

Aroma: Tart cherry, pie filling and light chlorine.

Taste: Bitter fruit pit (cherry or peach), funky vinegar and tart cherry.

Mouthfeel: Juicy, puckering with modest levels of carbonation.

Overall:  Really good,not very sour, but decent levels of funk, and very tasty.  The bottle suggests not opening this for an entire year. I couldnt wait.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

3419,"2010-11-21",4.0,"Jar fill from Uber Tavern. Ok, so the draught version has more alcohol than the bottle? Newer version i.e., not the 2008, but the 2010. Brown, ruby appearance. Not much head on this thing; actually, there wasnt any head at all. Wow, this beer is pungent -- cherries, brett, and some red wine barrels are coming through. Damn, this thing is pungent, considering that Ive let this warm up quite a bit. Very big sour cherry funkiness to this. A little bit of brett pops through. Its not so much mouth-puckering tart as much as it is fruity. This does have a very nice slippery, oily texture. For a sour brew, this has the perfect texture, at this point. A nice woody flavor pokes through, and the brett compliments this. Damn, drinking this warmer than usual makes this an awesome sour. Nice tart cherry flavor. I want a bottle of this, but I must say, the draught version is better.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

The flavor is sweet up front with a complex layer of fruitiness. The balsamic like astringency is balanced nicely with a hint of molasses like sweetness. Sweet and sour comes to mind. I imagine the age has added an additional layer of complexity as it tastes slightly more funky than expected. Overall, a really nice beer that will satisfy any sourhead, yet not clobber your palate.

2012 vintage tasted on 11/23/12. It pours a dark amber color with a small, fizzy off white head. It retains at about 3/4 inch. The aroma is really inviting with a quick burst of sour cherry, raisins, brown sugar, hints of red wine vinegar. Smells nice. The flavor is very rich and tart with raisins, plums, sour cherries, brown sugar and a little wood aged vinegar in the finish. Not a lot of funk, just a lot of dark fruity maltiness balanced perfectly with a good amount of tart/acetic acid to give it some kick. The mouthfeel is much bigger than I remember...probably because of the boost in gravity this year. The finish has a lot of woodiness and salty leather. Wow. I really love this vintage.

Pours a very dark crimson red color and topped by a small, foamy tan colored head that shows good retention and leaves some lines of lace around the glass. The aroma shows a good dose of soured cherries, oak laden vanilla, vinous pinot grapes, and some dryness from the wild brett yeast. The flavor follows suit with the sour cherries and woody oak coming through strong followed by hints of the vinous grapes, vanilla, and some floral hop bitterness. The cherries add a nice tartness to the flavor profile while the brett yeast seems to dry things out on the palate. Medium to full bodied on the mouthfeel, dry and tart with ample carbonation. The sour cherries linger on the finish. This is a great beer, and am glad I have another bottle to see how one does with some age on it.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

Edit: 2010 version.  Draft.  Very good, again.  Much more funky oak flavor than I remember from the last batch.  Very woody dry.  Sort of a cheesy flavor.

3419,"2010-05-23",3.7,"Appearance: A crisp mahogany without much murkyness. 1 finger cream colored head quickly dissipates to nothingness.

Smell: Very lively and enticing mix of grapes, oak, cherries, and some vinegar. Not as sour or as vinegar like as other oud bruins which leads me to thinking it will be quite drinkable.

Taste: Not as complex as the nose and my suspicion about the high drinkability is accurate. The fruitlike qualities of cherries, grapes, and red wine meet some butter cream, salt and vinegar and are presented in a well balanced mix. Aftertaste is minimal for the style. I was hoping for more from the wild yeast they boast about using on the bottle. The taste has many less dimensions than the smell.

Mouthfeel: Mildly dry, medium body for the style, low carbonation.

Drinkability: Extremely high for the style and for a 9% alcohol brew.

This is an outstanding American attempt at an Oud Bruin. Its well balanced and toned down compared to some of the more extreme examples of this style. If bold is what you are looking for you will be disappointed.

Ive ordered 2 more bottles from Bottle Trek and am glad I did. My thoughts were to cellar them but the brew is already so drinkable and smooth that I dont think additional aging would enhance this brew.

9/27/09 REVIEW: 1 YEAR LATER TO THE DAY

I decided to crack open my last Dissident today and when I looked up my initial review I was surprised to see that I had written it exactly one year ago!

Appearance and smell are the same as a year ago. The flavor hasnt improved at all. If anything the yeast is the same to slightly more pronounced. Mouthfeel is getting a touch thinner. I liked it a touch better fresh. Id say drink em now if you still have em.

A- Dark murky cedar colored body that pours with a 2-3 finger or so off-white head. Head eventually fades to a thick collar and has great retention from there. Some lacing is left behind in the glass. Body is somewhat translucent but the red light still shines through pretty well

S-Vinegar comes to the nose first followed by a metallic presence. Underneath this is additional sourness, oak, cherry and a yeasty funk. Its right on for the style-but maybe a little too metallic.

T-Upfront the oak and cherries really come through well and underneath is a slightly sour funk typical of the style of any Belgian brown. Some more sourness comes through for the finish-this sourness is more acidic than vinegarlike and is light to moderate in strength. What lingers on the palate is a slight acidic sourness, oak, a hint of cherry and a very slight metallc presence.

P- Wonderful. Light to medium carbonation and a smooth slightly yeasty body.

O- This is a very good beer. Much milder than other sours I have experienced recently. The oak and cherry are really the main characters for this brew. A well done brew by Deschutes and I look forward to trying others (have the Abyss 08 in my cellar).

3419,"2009-11-03",3.6,"Deep brownish red with a rather small tanned head that actually stays on for a while before settling. Some lacings.

The smell is quite interesting. There is a prominent mix of tart vinegar and clean brett aromas going on with notes of really funky barnyard, cherry tannins, red wine-like grapes, grass, yeast and wet wood. Hints of oaky vanilla. A complex smell, but slightly too edgy.

The taste is not as complex nor as interesting as the smell would have you to believe. Its actually quite sweet with prominent malty flavors of caramel coupled with pleasant tart fruit aromas (cherries and grapes). Complementary, somewhat clean, brett aromas and notes of mud, oak, grass and vanilla. Hints of yeast. The finish has a mild bitterness to it, brett, sweetish alcohol and dry cherry notes. I think it would have benefited from less alcohol flavors.

Medium, almost full body, and medium carbonation which is not how I want a Flanders Oud bruin to be - I prefer them with more carbonation. Its actually almost smooth and sticky.

A fairly good attempt at a style that seems hard to master outside of the boarders of Belgium. Its slightly too heavy and big to be really good. The additions from the cherries are really nice though.

3419,"2009-09-25",4.1,"Deep red/pink pour with a 1 finger frothy head; really nice looking brew. Aroma is extremely strong, caught a whiff right after opening the bottle. Notes of red wine, funk, yeast, and sour cherry are predominant , and the lightest bit of spice, perhaps clove, mixes in there as well. The flavor starts with tons of fruit, notably cherry, black currant, and a bit of dark fruit. This seamlessly weaves into the funk that comprises the middle section of the flavor. The finish goes back to a sweeter note, and I think this is where the red wine notes hit. Palate is very drinkable, but the sour sweetness sticks to the tongue exquisitely, and the 9% is absurdly well hidden. Not quite as robust as Cantillons Saint Lamvinus, but definitely reminds me of that, at least in terms of a broader genre. Excellent brew- looking forward to having more of Deschutes offerings.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

The excellently proportioned brett funk and hay follows closely behind, as does red wine grapes and the most subtle of tannins. Sweet considering the style- not attenuated to near the extent of some of its counterparts, though it works excellently here. Funk is quite up front, though vinegar is absent.

Deeper inspection shows more cherry, oak, slight vinegar, and a light sweetness of caramel and vanilla. Initial is a nice tartness, cherry and vanilla follow suit with caramel malts, oaky qualities, dryness, a fairly lively body. Well carbonated, mellower than the aroma originally led me to believe. Finish is tart cherries, dry oakiness, and a very mellow sweetness. Sour finish and tart lactic qualities remain on the palate, touch of soft cheese and sweet malt. Overall, a pretty good sour..

Thanks to a generous trader for sending this my way.  Now that I am catching up on my backlog I have time to get my rating in.  As with the Abyss I hope that this sees regular release cycles and is not just a special one-off test batch.  If so I may just have to buy another bottle despite the thick wax seal.

Aroma / Appearance - The thin beige head is supported by a ruby tinged body which glows under light.  Murky lacing completes a picture perfect setting.  Sour cherries and topioca pudding laced with cinnamon, and red hot remind me of a sour brown that someone has spiked with red hots.

Flavor / Palate - Dried sourdough bread, chocolate, and chili powder fill every corner of the palate.  Very drinkable despite its 9% ABV content, this is fluid as it travels down the throat.  The sour finish is not tart enough to upset the stomach but does clear out any bugs that may be lingering in the stomach.  Im not sure what this costs but if it is anything less than $14.99 a bomber its worth buying at least once.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3419,"2009-03-31",3.5,"In short: A funky, sour and very acidic ale that is also very sweet (caramel, maraschino cherries) and overly tannic.  An Intense sipper better in small servings.
How: Bottle 22oz, was-top.  2008 batch (first one).  Consumed when about 6 months of age.  Sent to me by Oakbluff.  Thank-you so very much Scott.
The look: Beautiful red-brown-amber body topped by a medium beige head with low retention
In long: The nose is moderately wild with a sweet maraschino cherries.  Taste is surprisingly caramelized.  Caramelized malts, oak, maraschino cherries, a lot of earth, some vinegar.  Very heavy, especially for the style.  I dont think Ive ever had a sour ale that was so sweet while remaining very sour and very acidic. The beer is extremely astringent, too much so.  A strong sensation of red wine tannins and thats where the beer lost its appeal to me.  Far from highly drinkable.  The high average score of this beer can only be due to people sharing bottles.  So tannins/puckery sensation is so strong that it me about 30 minutes to go through my bomber.

3419,"2009-02-13",3.7,"22oz bottle $8.99. I poured this into a snifter and put on Pearl Jam (because I am corny and the namesake of this beer is a good song). Clear, ruby red which seems odd but then I am no expert on flanders reds or oud bruins. First whiff gave off burnt rubber but quickly moved on to a lightly sour vinegar aroma with cherries with the rubber still darting in from the back and a slight touch of alcohol. Nice sour flavors of cherries, just enough to make my mouth slightly pucker but nothing like Supplication or La Folie sour, much more muted and that rubber makes a brief appearance in the flavor. I actually wanted to like this more but I have had too many good sours this year and I am not sure I could taste any hint of wood and the rubber aromas and flavors were off-putting. This is not hard to drink however and does get better as it warms (like most beers).

update 10/12/08
The second bottle contains no rubber and tastes/smells better. Maybe because I drank some Isabelle just prior?

Aroma of wine-like characters and almost lambic in nature.  Really thick palate that filled and expanded nicely in the mouth.  This brown style had a little more bitterness and darker malt notes than its Red counterpart, and it seemed the wild yeast really did a nice job with this recipe/batch.

Even though they scored similar to me, it was nice to see the immediate contrast between the Brown style and the Red style.  Thanks to Mike Starzec for the complementary round.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
3419,"2009-01-16",4.1,"Pours hazy amber with a ruby hue. A quarter inch head rose up before settling down to a placid surface, with a few errant dots of lacework.

Aromatics hit the nose as soon as the beer goes into the glass, with fruity acid wafting up.
Cherries, red wine, balsamic vinegar, ripe malt, and warming spice. Hints of cinnamon, peppercorns, cedar, sherry, and rhubarb follow through.

Medium bodied, with a lightly prickled mouthfeel, and drying.

Ripe, red fruits, acid, and oaky tannins are supported by a malty base on the palate.
As the brew warms hints of subtle spice step forward. Nutmeg, anise, and Schezuan peppercorns. Plenty of acid without being lactic or sour. 

Finishes with cherries, sherry, balsamic, pepper-studded earthy cedar, and warming alcohol. 

Wowza. Great beer now, but just wait a few years for this one to really meld, mellow, and complexify. The Pinot Noir barrels add a tremendous depth that is not typically found in Oud Bruins.
The tartness level now is firm, but allows the brew to be very drinkable. Im curious to see if some cellar time will add much sourness.

Do yourself a favor and let this one warm up to room temperature.

3419,"2009-01-10",4.1,"22 oz. bottle courtesy of trades with both mashmaster and bitbucket.  As an aside before I begin my rating, I have to say that I really like the label graphics for this beer, very cool.  Thankfully, the wax on this bottle is soft and easy to cut through.  The beer itself pours a deep golden amber with a thin off-white head.  The aroma is pleasantly sour with just enough funk to give that barnyard smell but not be so strong as to mask the other attributes.  A generous amount of sour cherry in the nose as well.  The flavor is equally nice with old leather, barnyard funk, sour cherry and oak.  The tannins in the finish remind me more of a cabernet than of beer.  Sour ales are a style that I probably have the most difficulty with, as I really dont enjoy (and I guess appreciate) the uber sour beers, but this one I thought was just excellent.  My wife, who doesnt like sours at all, also thought this was very good.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"

initially lots of cherry in the aroma which fades to unveil metal, blood/iron/mineral, woody vanilla and cement-like bretty funk. it smells fairly sweet (for the style).

i get a lot of cinnamon flavor... along with ripe cherries, vanilla, caramel, toasted nuttiness and mineral-y bretty stink. there is a touch of malty sweetness to start. but, by the time the sip is over my tongue is dried off completely.... thanks brett! it*s tart and sour but not overly on either. the aftertaste lingers long into the night as fresh cherries. alcohol does come into play as it warms the sinus and chest the same way wine does... it*s quite pleasant. the medium body leans heavily on full. the carbonation gives it a creamy soft mouth feel which coats my mouth entirely yet it is spicy and prickly with a twangy kick.

3419,"2008-12-21",4.0,"I bought The Dissident without really knowing what it was.  I mean, I didnt even see who the brewer was.  But the label was so cutting, so dark, so angsty I couldnt say no.  The effect was only made more profound by its solitude on the shelf - no other Dissident in sight.  Very appropriate.  Also, Im not sure why, but from purchase to refrigeration, I thought the Dissident was going to be a deep, dark stout.  Imagine my surprise when I saw the less than dense pour and the smell of vinegar.  Instead, the beer is somewhat translucent, taken to the color of oak tree bark and a thin lily pad head of tan bubbles.  Alcohol commands the aroma, guiding vinous, wine-like qualities and a vinegar bite into my nose, resembling a Flemish Sour Ale in its woody, winey, sour scent portfolio.   The flavor is immediately familiar, but I cant label it at first.  Then I take a gander at the label.  Of course!  The Brett!  This beer is all about the Brett, bolstered by a dense traffic of carbonation, flavors of black cherries and oak, and a good, sharp ethanol bite.  The oak dryness and the alcohol cut almost to excess, but keep decorum where it counts, making this a very tasty, drinkable beer.  It may not have been an oil stout, but its got a lot of good flavor, and affirms that Brettanomyces has hurdled over the acquired taste status into a well loved and familiar flavor.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Once I was done removing the wax, the beer poured with a small head that quickly faded into a strong halo lacing.  Color is dark orange-ish copper, but completely clear.  Some carbonation bubbles visible through the beer.  Aroma is strong, it comes off as a super high octane Flanders Red made by an American brewer (as advertised, not exactly the best thing, imo).  It is not like a BFM strong Sour Red but its got some similar characteristics. There is cherry, lightly syrupy sourness, but it also has a lot of alcohol and some leafiness coming off the oak. Taste follows with a little bit more alcohol coming through especially at the end of the flavor.  It feels like I took a shot of liquor and I have a bit of an ethanol mistiness on the palate. Its a little prickly and pear-like as well, some light acidity in there.  Its strong, definitely strong and some of that gets in the way of the Flanders aspects.  Oak and alcohol on the back end, different, American, doable but I wont be able to do the same with many other beers like it.

Its not as bold ad La Foille or Rodenbach Grand Cru, but I think it does an excellent job of recreating the Oud Bruin style. It would be nice to see what this beer tastes like in a year or two. Mouthfeel is full and round. The finish is clean and smooth. The aftertaste is slightly sweet with some sourness in the background.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
3419,"2008-10-23",4.0,"Very beautiful deep garnet color. Head quickly dissipates. Bold nose of sour old fruits, mostly cherries, and malt.  Not too horsey, but rainy barnyard dominated by an unattended orchard maybe, where most of the overripe fruit has split and decayed on the ground. Wet diaper underneath. That was fun, now to taste: Nose becomes slightly medicinal as it heads toward my lips, Crisp and vinegary on the tongue. Pithy fruit skins with an apple-cider vinegar, sour candy and brett chaser. In my humble opinion it leans a little toward geueze in taste just because it’s very sour and bitey and complex compared to say, the Duchess or Goudenband (RIP) Flemish browns. With the alcohol content, this is a bottle of dynamite. Way to go, Deschutes.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","BritAlesRule"
3419,"2008-10-22",3.7,"An absolute beauty of a beer.  Pours a slightly cloudy dark amber, with a perfect, thick and frothy head.  I let this one warm up a bit before drinking and had a fair amount of lacing.  Aroma is a bit off, but smells like a typical farmhouse ale.  Flavor is very good...sweet and sour like a lemon/llime soda, fruity (banana, raisin), and tons of yeast.  Its like a eating a perfect loaf of warm sourdough bread.  Palate is medium/heavy bodied, and much creamier than I expected.  I’m not a huge fan of this style, but overall this is one of the best sours I’ve encountered.

Aroma is malty, with funky cherries and earthy wood.  Not like other sours.  Smooth and warm cherry, malt, oak, and vanilla.  When the sour comes, it is mellow.  Mostly brett and cherries, but in a vinuous/sherry way.  Drinks more like a liquer than a funky, sour pucker-bomb.  Excellent beer.","San Diego, California, USA","trokini"
3419,"2008-10-21",3.4,"Bottle (with annoying wax-coated cap, when will brewers stop this nonsense?).

Head is initially small, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing.
Body is dark amber.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (caramel, toasted grain), trace yeast (barnyard), with notes of apple skin, cherry, wood.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.

This sadly shows little effect of the advertised 18 months of aging (other than the usual cherry and wood notes), and almost no Brett character.  That said, the aroma is still attractive and without flaws.  The flavor balance is good, if a tad syrupy sweet.  There certainly is ample tartness, but this is about half as sour as, say, La Folie.  The alcohol is hidden well. All in all, it comes up short of greatness, but it’s still a pleasant approximation of the targeted style.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

3419,"2008-10-19",4.1,"Pours a deep red/brown with no head whatsoever, even with a vigorous straight pour into my Orval goblet. I could already smell the ample aroma wafting out of the bottle. Once in the glass, the aroma opens up even more. First impression is of Rodenbach (which makes sense). There is some other complexity underlying in there. The funk and sour smell is more subdued, but there is also ample cherry, oak, and vanilla aroma. Taste is quite sour, though not Rodenbach Grand Cru sour. Fairly easy drinking for a sour beer. The oak and cherry flavors are more pronounced than usual, which is nice. I think that this may be a great gateway sour for people. Would pair well with cheeses and spicy foods. There is a little tiny bit of sludge in the bottom of my bottle, but I have heard from multiple sources that it is pasteurized/not bottle conditioned, so I don’t have very high hopes for aging this one, which is a shame. In fact, I heard that Deschutes is doing that to all their beers, even this sour and their high alcohol special releases...they need to get with the program for cellaring enthusiasts.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Avengedpoet"

Pour is a thin liquid of reddish brown color with small formation of fizzy foam that turns into an O-ring.  The aroma is very similar to a red wine because of the sour grape, wood, and faintest scent of alcohol present. Also, smells sort of close to potpourri too.  Beer is bold and rich with sour and tart tastings that then leave behind a sweet sugary residue around my lips. Flavors can be defined as a red wine with a lingering sour grape and hint of wood barrel s while there is a sweet sugar or rose water aftertaste.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

3419,"2008-10-12",4.1,"Poured into a tulip wine glass. Strawberry preserves color, with a creamy pink/tan head. Tons of effervescence streaming up from the depths of the glass. Excellent retention and solid films of lacing.

Aroma is chiefly black cherries, with smoldering oak, crabapple, and balsamic vinegar.

An initial sweetish natural plum/cherry juice note is quickly tempered by a rush of winey tannins and fresh brettiness. The alcohol comes through occasionally, but it blends rather well with the other flavors, taking on a cabernet quality. Reasonably complex, but it’s a little boozy and young right now. This seems like a perfect candidate for a year of aging before a second sampling. The brett could fully blossom, the booze could mellow out, etc.

3419,"2008-09-28",3.9,"22oz from Bottletrek. Very tough wax to get off the bottle, but I guess Deschutes is into that for their special releases. Worth the wait? Absolute. A very impressive brown-to-ruby pour with a lively head and lasting carbonation. I’m a fan of the style and it’s very nice to see an American brewery doing such an excellent rendition, but not a mere copycat of, say, Liefmans Goudenband (the most obvious comparison in some sense). Nice pert nose, some dark cherries and such in there. The taste adds some rich yeasts to the equation and a verrrry subtle touch of vanilla and oak to make this one a bit distinct. High quality brown at the foundation, with very nice, interesting, and satisfying touches to round it out. Dry finish but not at the expense of the rich, nicely complex flavors.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Cobbwebb notes abound in the flavor with a not-too-tart motuhfeel and a fruity nice tongue-ability in the tail. For their  FIRST sour beer, Deschutes hit a homerun with this one. Wow!

Bomber and a draft later from Malt & Vine. The particular yeast in this one takes over the nose, reminding me of a sour cider common to Frankfurt, Germany. Thin but lasting golden head.

First aroma is dark cherry pits and unripened cherries.  Some leathery and bitter lemon rindy brett is also prevalent, with only a little bit of vinegar in the background.  Flavor is fairly citrusy with the cherries toned back a bit.  There are also some red wine tannins I didnt pick up at first in the aroma until I tasted the beer.  Dry lightly oaky finish with bitterness peaking at a 2-3, and tartness at a 4.  Light to moderate carbonation with a creamy medium body.

Nose is creamed cherries, mild wood (dry), a light note of cherry pit, some more pronounced apple cider vinegar acetic notes show through when it opens up over time.  Full and thick up front, moderately acidic... the tang is fairly mild and somewhat creamy.  It hints of a sour explosion but then basically just drops off into a bland and transparent pastiness left on the palate.   Over time the sourness seems to mute the tongue so it appears to drop off, and theres more of this sweetened cherry juice note that annoyingly sticks around.

3419,"2008-09-24",2.1,"Rusted brick colored brew with a well lasting white head.  Really poor nose.  Main complaint is the poor concentration and vibrancy and the aromatic elements that are present are mostly unpleasant, brash and unauthentic.  Notes of sweet cherries, vanilla and oak are present in the nose, but mostly covered by the unpleasant aromas.  Flavor is initially sweet in the front and mid-palate and then fades into a sour harshness towards the finish.  Really poorly balanced and brash.  Unauthentic and very hard to drink.  Some serious problems with this beer: Sterile filtered and force carbonated, aging a portion in wood for only 3 months (not long enough and age the whole beer.)

Light body and moderate carbonation. Lightly sweet taste with a lightly tart finish. As much as I like this beer, and even though barrel aging adds complexity, ’The Dissident’ is one more example of how wine barrels work better on paper than they do in practice. Maybe in a year or so when the flavors mellow a bit and the brett has a chance to have its way? The cherries end up being an aside.

3419,"2008-09-13",5.0,"UPDATED: SEP 20, 2008 I’m in love with this rendition of a Flanders style Oud Bruin/Kriekbier. The color, head, and particularly the lacing are exquisite. The nose is quite refined, and redolent of sour cherries, some restrained, and even elegant banyard/horseblanket (an amazing paradox in itself) very subtle hints of baker’s chocolate, and a touch of something like pomegranite.

The body is not too rich, but nicely mouthcoating, and the flavors echo the aromas, with the pinot noir, and cabernet barrel aging quite evident. There is a nice tartness, although it is somewhat muted compared to the nose...this contributes to this ale’s elegance, but restrains its wildness. Perhaps the Brett will open up with some more aging, but even if it doesn’t, I’m thrilled with how this beauty turned out, (in fact, I’m sort of hoping it doesn’t, since that might impact negatively on the refined elegance the beer has already)  It’s my hands-down favorite among The Deschutes Reserve series, thusfar, and one of my favorite three beers ever (the other two being Olde Curmudgeon, and Stillenacht Reserve 1996).","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Caskalefan"
3419,"2008-09-13",3.8,"A vigorous pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a frothy, somewhat large bubbled, initially three-finger thick, lightly amber tinged, tan colored head.  The beer is dark amber / plum color that shows an almost brilliantly clear, light cranberry color when held up to the light.  The aroma is quite wine like as it smells of dark fruit and oak.  Further inspection yields a noticeable, but light, lactic tartness that accentuates aromas of sour grapes, tart plums and fermented raisins.  The oak is the most dominant part of the nose with spicy oak notes, a woody tannic sort of thing, a touch of butterscotch, and some light vanillin notes towards the finish.  This actually gets fairly toasty towards the finish (a bit like lightly browned saltine crackers) that is definitely malt induced but could also be from some toasty oak influence.  The fruit aromatics get a touch jam like as the beer warms up a bit too.

Fairly thick and chewy with a tart, fruitiness that sort of clings to the palate, but doesnt provide much, if any at all, sweetness.  The oak character seems to have contributed lots of tannic structure that has influenced the body and mouthfeel of this beer.  this has quite a bit of berry-accented red wine like flavors to it as well as just a touch of perceived fruity sweetness.  The finish has a fair amount of oak influence, but it is only one part of this beer and does not play the leading role that it did in the aroma.  The tartness is actually less than it was in the aroma too, even though it was fairly light there.  This has a substantial, flavorful, though somewhat soft, sour cherry flavor to it, especially as the beer warms up; both the flavorful tannic skin contributes to the flavor as does a fleshy cherry fruitiness.  As it warms it also picks up some concord grape flavors as well as definitely getting more sweet.

This is a really easy drinking sour beer; it is very soft for a wild fermented beer and quite clean.  The wine barrels and cherries almost seem to be more influential than the wild bugs, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.  This is actually on the simplistic side for something that could have been funky and challenging; on the plus side though it is quite refined.  This is fantastically drinkable, especially considering its alcohol content & I definitely like the bright fruit character that is here as well as the balance provided by the oak character.

3419,"2008-09-11",3.4,"22. Super-cool label. Which says 9% for the bottled version, if you’re keeping score at home. Pours a crystal clear dark reddish brown under a towering, thick, moussy tan head that hangs around for a fair little while. Humongous sour cherry, balsamic vinegar, and oak nose. Really funky, strong, and inviting. Taste starts out sharp, plenty of cherry and balsamic. Then the mid-palate goes away to practically nothing, really light and actually disappointing. There’s kind of a CO2 bubble that forms in the mouth. Massive oak tannins take over after the mid-palate, and that woody astringency is pretty much the finish. Not bad for a V1, especially from a dedicated brewer of American ales a million miles from Belgium. If they can body it up and get some depth and complexity across to the finish, they’ll have a serious shot at a world classic here.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

On tap at the PDX Pub. Pours dark red, slight mahogany hue, very thin off-white head. Tart berry nose, light sweetness, maybe soft chocolate, but dominated by tart and sour cherry. The pinot barrels give a lot of grape skin flavor in the finish, earthy but not as wild of a brett character as I hoped. The brett is young, still on a short leash, give it a while and this beer will pick up some nice wild brett esters, but this early on its very refrained in that realm. The beer overall is ok, its no Supplication. The brett needs time to build up more funkiness, the carbonation a bit soft on draft reducing the dryness.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
