The pour is dark brown with a modest tan head that becomes a ring and laces. But the nose is alive with coffee and milk chocolate malts and a hint of butter or butterscotch.

Your mouth wont insist theres any actual coffee or chocolate in it, as the label claims it will (You can tell there isnt), but there are definitely what wed refer to in beer terms as chocolate and coffee notes that would be hard to miss. I prefer when brewers create tastes with basic beer ingredients instead of adding adjuncts anyhow (Yes, coffee and chocolate count as adjuncts). Good beer that achieves seasonal taste with malts and brewing technique versus tossing sugar, spices, coco, etc. into the brewing vat.","Maryland, USA","CharmCityCrab"

4169,"2013-01-02",3.8,"6 pack purchased at Trader Joes in Davis, CA.  The aroma on this is quite roasted, with lightly sweet vanilla character and a little bit of chocolate, too.  Underlying anise and metallic character are also evident.  Mildly transparent dark mahogany body present with a medium light tan head.  Attractive brew. Wow, this tastes a little different than I expected.  Starts with a good deal of toastiness, before it becomes a little metallic with touches of anise in the middle.  Roasts follow, and then more dry, super toasty flavor comes through in the finish.  Unique, interesting flavor.  I like.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

The aroma is caramel, bready and sweet, with some chocolate and a hint of nuttiness. A medium bodied dunkel bock. The malts are caramel and sweet, with some chocolate. The hops are earthy and herbal. Nice carbonation. Semi sweet chocolate, some raisins and some dark fruit. Perhaps a touch on the sweet side, but kind of balanced by the chocolate. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth.

4169,"2012-12-29",3.5,"12oz bottle via 6pack from Spirits Middletown. Poured a good looking black center with super dark mahogany brown edges underneath an average sized creamy medium beige head. Aroma is like a chocolate egg creme, notes of light chocolate, lactose, wet nutts, medium toast and a tootsie roll wax wrapper. Medium bodied with softer carbonation and a creamy full finish. Flavor is much like the aroma where a light chocolate and lactose dominate followed by some dark fruit, wet nut shells and lightly burnt toast. I didnt like this out of the bottle, I hardly ever drink a beer that way, not sure if this needs to breath or if every beer is just beter from a glass. This one is without a doubt better poured into a wide mouth tulip for sure though.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
