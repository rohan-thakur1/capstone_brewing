3497,"2013-07-03",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
This super silky concoction relies on a dark malt blend which develops dark fruit, chocolate, licorice and caramel until peppery hops build balance in the finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy dollop of foam sits atop the gleaming dark brown.
-A mineral twang accompanies the hops in the finish.
-The mouthfeel is a tad sweetish, but it is remarkably silky and rich.
-This is the kind of grain bill we rarely taste in North America. Very interesting!

Mostly roasted flavor too, some bitterness bringing a bit of balance, and also the same toffee and pine cones found in the aroma. More or less full bodied, dryish and pleasantly carbonated. Bitter finish. A tasteful and easy drinkable beer, but not very exiting anyway. 130524","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

Compete, compete, do it for the boys
Empty barrels make the most noise
Youre always on the move
Youve always got something to prove

What the fuck are you fighting for?
Is it because youre five foot four?
You better be happy with what youve got
Youll never get any more

You laugh at a man when he tries
Youre trying to make up for your size
To you life is a rivalry
Keep a step ahead of me

I like this beer but it doesnt make me feel as good as listening to Minor Threat. Partizan equals mild. MT equals ferocious ball of energy. Hardcore.","Birmingham, West Midlands, ENGLAND","Dommod2011"
3497,"2013-05-23",3.9,"Bottle at home in London - snagged from the brewery. Pours clear, red-brown with a lasting, tight creamy yellow-beige head. Brown bread in the nose, some ripe - and almost rotting - fruits, soft toast. Light to medium sweet flavor with well toasted brown bread, some mellow earthy and dirty bitterness, dried and ripened berries, some leather. Light to medium bodied with fine, smooth carbonation. Moderate toasty bread sweetness to finish, more earthy bitterness, leathery fruits, mild mustiness, suggestions of the alcohol, some mellow cocoa. Another solid offering from Partizan.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
3497,"2013-05-20",4.0,"Bottle @ Partizan Brewery. The pours deep brown with a small tan head. The nose is cola bottle candy, some brown bread toast, sweet bubblegum and fruit & nut chocolate bar. Hints of red berry, grape. The taste is nutella-slathered brown toast. Smooth and nutty. Light, nimble body. Some red fruits and more bubblegum. Soft carbonation. Rich without being cloying. Overall, a really nice effort. Great, in fact.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
3497,"2013-05-17",3.9,"Bottle from Cotteridge Wines, dark brown pour with foam magnolia head, sweet chocolate and coffee aroma, sweet porter like taste with chocolate and coffee a couple of milds recently that taste like porters. Very good regardless of style.","Birmingham, West Midlands, ENGLAND","RichTheVillan"
