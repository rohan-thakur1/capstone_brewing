3313,"2015-12-05",3.5,"Aroma - a nice malt quality with some spiced hops.
Appearance - body is a pale yellow, the head starts bubbly about 2"" falls and slowly falls to a sliver of foam. There is some dappled lacing.
Taste - is clean and refreshing, with just a bit of bitterness. The malts and hops are very subtle and very well balanced. Classically pilsener. It doesnt have the grassy quality some poor pilseners have. Nice zesty quality about the bitters.
Palate - the body is light, the texture thin, the carbonation lively, and the finish is just a tease of zesty bitterness. Very enjoyable.

Very nice example of the variety.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"

3313,"2015-01-08",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 17, 2015 12 oz. brown bottle into a foothills glass
A: Dull hazy amber orange color. Like apple cider. No clarity. Minimal off white foamy head. Not much carbonation visible. A bit of lace as drunk.

S: Sourdough bread and fruity hop scent. Nice.

T: Snappy bitterness from the hop giving way to a very good balance with the malty sweetness toward the end. Finishes bitter but clean. Malt more evident as the brew warms. Quite good and highly drinkable.

M: Light but not watery. More carb tingle than is visible which I like. Kind of cardboardy with a stiffness and the most minimal stickiness. I like this a lot.

O: Keller Pils is a pleasant surprise. Especially since, unless I misread the stamp, this beer appears to be pretty damned old but my fault for not seeing that in store. This is good enough IMO to buy regularly but at $10/6, I likely wont revist it very often. It is very good though.

3313,"2014-07-03",2.9,"Bottle (brewed in Pittston, PA -- by Susquehanna Brewing Co?).

Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is hazy light yellow.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted bread/grain), lightly to moderately hoppy (herbs, flowers), lightly to moderately yeasty (dough), with light notes of minerals and sulfur.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

Other than the doughy yeast note, the nose is actually quite evocative of Franconian pils, so it deserves some props for that. Sadly, it doesnt hold up in the mouth experience, being pretty flabby/syrupy and overly sweet. Some more attention to detail on this one might be able to turn this into a winner.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

3313,"2013-07-21",3.8,"Appearance:
Golden cereal grains and orange with a light haze. The white head fades into a thin white collar surrounding a broken layer of white.

Nose:
Herbal, bready, yeasty, and orangey with the bitter zest of orange skin in the back. Freshly baked whole grain breads still slightly warm to the touch with a golden brown crust. Wheat grass. Dried herbs in the bread.

Palate:
Bready, yeasty, grassy, nutty, whole grain seeds and cereal grains, and wheat grass. Chewy mouthfeel thanks to being unfiltered, hence the light haze. Bitter bite in the back of dried grass and herbs. Finishes dry, thirst quenching, and thirst inducing. Table crackers and toast underneath for support and some crisp crunch.

Final Thoughts:
Brilliantly balanced flavorful Keller Pils from the genius brewers at Southampton Publick House. Southampton brews clean beers that are perfectly to style without being boring or underwhelming. In fact, they are over-achievers, raising the bar for other brewers who dare to brew in the same vein. Delicious.

-A veil of foam covers the misty gold.
-This is sweeter than the Mahrs Pils I had next to it. I expected something crisper, I presume.
-The prickly carbonation helped pierce the doughy maltiness.
-Light citrus was shared by the hops.

This one pours a bit hazier of a color than most keller plseners. Even though they all are unfiltered the German ones seem to prefer a pale brightness that I dont get with this beer. It is a monotonous almost whiteish gold.

The smell is more on par with a true kellerbier. It is grassy with some lime and a nice mineral water/malt body.

The flavor is pretty nice as well, doesnt hold up to the Franconian beers but as a US beer we have a winner. Nice and bitter with an herbal, grassy bite, but a balance of pilsener malt and a nice water character.

Aroma: The nose has some straw, grass, and hay that goes along with a crisp, clean hop character

Aroma is toasty bread, light cracker, moderately solid pils malt, light dough and light grassy herbal german hops.  Flavor is soft and mostly delicate, with a doughy yeasty bread character, yet still crisp and nice herbal light grassy hop and mineral finish and very smooth.  I think the 12 oz bottles are even better than the 3 times I had it on tap this summer.  Pretty good price on the 6-packs means Ill probably continue to buy this as long as it stays fresh.

Aroma is doughy, yeasty, a bit of sulfur left over from fermentation, earth and nice pils bready maltiness.  More dough and yeast flavor with hints of earthy hops, light citrus, and some spice.  Ok bitterness, and fairly smooth.  I prefer the Triumph keller to this one, but still good.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

3313,"2007-05-30",3.7,"On tap at the SPH.  Arrived at the table a crystal clear medium gold with a thin white ring that left farily nice lacing down the glass.  Llight aroma of yeast and slightly woody.  The flavor was very refreshing with some yeast, some biscuit flavors, and moderate hoppiness.  I paired two pints of this beer with the Cajun Tuna special and enjoyed both very much.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
