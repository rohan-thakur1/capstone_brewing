2385,"2017-05-16",4.2,"Botella en 99Cervezas.

Vierte en un bonito color ámbar-caramelo rojizo, algo velado, aunque bastante transparente y brillante para ser una Ale. Formación de espuma color vainilla de burbuja pequeña y persistencia moderada. Buena carbonatación y adherencia.

De intensidad media-alta en nariz, da de inmediato notas de lúpulo y naranja (como de mermelada de naranja amarga). También hay notas de miel muy agradables y de fruta escarchada. El lúpulo va ganando espacio conforme evoluciona en nariz, apareciendo unas notas aquesadas y resinosas muy suaves. Gran complejidad y gran placer para nuestra nariz.

De entre los sabores básicos destaca el amargo y el ácido, en forma de punto cítrico. También hay algo de salado. Curiosamente, todo el dulce que se percibía en nariz parece estar ausente en el primer trago, pero está ahí y pronto se va abriendo paso conforme la cerveza evoluciona en boca. Entonces vuelve a salir la fruta escarchada y el caramelo, dando un final muy equilibrado de dulce, amargo y cítrico muy agradable. En ese sentido, resulta sorprendente en boca.

De cuerpo medio-ligero en boca y carácter claramente refrescante. No llena totalmente la boca aunque deja una sensación bastante agradable y nada pesada. Persistencia media.

Una cerveza sorprendentemente compleja tanto en nariz como en boca. La bebo y me recuerda al dulce de calabaza que en la zona de Alcoy llaman ""arrop i tallaetes"". Su complejidad le permite ser una cerveza todoterreno, tanto de trago largo como parte de un aperitivo, trago medio con una buena carne o una paellita, e incluso de trago corto que permita disfrutar poco a poco de su complejidad (a pesar de no ser de gran cuerpo). Absolutamente recomendable.","Valencia, SPAIN","JuanCC"

The hop aromas are a bit resinous. There is also a sweet malty touch and a yeasty aroma, I dont really know how to describe it. It smells a little bit old. I dont 100% like this smell. There are also some aromas of spices. Its a complex smell. The taste of the beer is pretty much the same. I taste a nice bitterness, caused by the hops, together with a nice hoppy sour touch. There is also this malty sweetness. The beer is quite tasty. It is nice, and a bit complex. Just a good beer, like every BrewDog beer. I like the amount of hops in this beer.

2385,"2015-04-28",3.0,"Appearance: pours with a medium beige head, the beer is a very hazy bronze color that isn't transparent
Aroma: strong caramel malt, spicy rye perhaps hard to pick up much else
Taste: lightly toasted caramel malt sweetness with that gentle Scottish taste to it, has a very slight bitterness on the finish, very faint grain
Palate: has a light mouthfeel, minimal caramel and bitter aftertaste, lively carbonation

Very refreshing, bitter, fruity hops from the beginning, going along with a high, metallic carbonation. Malt plays only a secondary role, aggressive, edgy hops define this ale. Nevertheless the malts belt both, hop and flashy carbonation, together. The end is a bit too watery, with no bitter-, nor fruitiness left, just the metallic taste of the carbonation is still on the palate. A light-bodied beer with a chewy, sparkling mouthfeel, and just a short moment, of warm, earthy amber ale feeling, after the first impression is settled.

Taste: Powerful hop bitterness straight away, reminding me slightly of Punk IPA. Pine like and citrusy which then subsides and the maltyness comes through. Certainly more interesting than I was expecting!

Palate: The sharp bitterness of the hops at the start prevent it from being watery or bland. Mildish carbonation.

Det som er interessant er at de kjører på med humle: ""Simcoe, Chinook, Nelson Sauvin, Centennial. Twist: Loads of late hops and bucket-loads of dry hops"", og det gjør virkelig noe for aromaen. Jeg blir allikevel litt skuffet etter de første munnfullene, den er god men har ingen umiddelbar staying power. Skulle vært interessant å prøve denne fra fat. Iconoclastic, my foot. Fra fat på Kooperstiven Nordsiden, Hønefoss: vi kommer rett fra Hønefossrevyen og heldigvis er der plass ved bardisken. Mye fint fatøl å velge i, og denne var en av de vi hadde.

2385,"2013-03-28",2.5,"330ml bottle bought at Biere von Irene in Yuen Long. Batch No. 566.

Cloudy, hazy dull ruby purplish-red colour; Very thin head and residual beige foam which fades in 20 seconds; Minimal lacing with active carbonation; Very fragrant aroma of raisin, floral, plum, dark fruit, light cherry, sparkling wine and sugar; Minimally sweet taste of light malt with light citrus, grapes, cream crackers, pines, herbs and light hops Med to light body, thin but slick palate; Taste profile is initially muted, no taste at all for a couple of seconds, then it hits you with the very light, dry biscuit malt plus light citrus, grapes, spices and herbal hops. All in really light dose. Hoppiness concentrates on aromas, and bitterness is very light, with mild astringency as finish. Pretty dry after taste, very easy to mouth.

Comments: I had high hope for this one before opening it, I wish I didnt. Its fruity aroma is really nice and attractive, but the taste does not match, very muted and flat, and failed to spark my interest. The use of Simcoe and Chinook hops make some interesting piney hoppiness, but its still light. Even Mendocinos Red Tail Ale tastes more exciting than this one. Its overall impression is underwhelming and disappointing. Would another batch be better? I dont wanna bet.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

2385,"2013-02-07",2.9,"Amber to coper coloured ale. Sweet / bitter with lots of caramel, malt and some hops in the taste. You describe it as a malty amber ale, because of the caramel and bread tast. Its medium bodied, with a dry ending (use of pale ale malt?). The hops arent dominating but are present. Nice bitterness but in the end a little too astringent in my opinion. I bought it in Belgium maybe if you can drink it fresh, the hops will cause more balance and the bitterness will be less astringent.","gentbrugge, BELGIUM","mateu"
2385,"2013-02-06",3.7,"Im not usually a fan of red ales because they tend to be essentially red-colored IPAs but drier. BrewDog 5 A.M. Saint definitely does not meet that description, thankfully. Its significantly malty while still retaining a strong hoppy presence. Not an amazing beer by any means, but not the same old red ale, either. 

I poured an 11.2oz bottle into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Murky cranberry/mahogany hue. Forms a fairly large, eggshell, frothy head which retains and laces quite well.

Smell: Slight pine sap and caramel candy, but with a slightly fusel scent.

Taste: While the palate to BrewDog 5 A.M. Saint may not be absolutely delicious, it does have almost perfect balance. Even though my bottle was a little old it still had plenty of hops throughout. Earthy, herbal and grassy hop character is the best way to describe the bitterness here. Pine needles, tree bark and citrus peel might be even more apt descriptors. Caramel maltiness through the middle imparts a mildly sweet, somewhat confectionery taste. Lemon lollipop also seems to be a flavor, though this is more likely an off-flavor than something deliberate (and one I dislike in beer across the board). 

It finishes with a big, dry hop bite and more earthy character as it goes down. The aftertaste is mostly clean, though there is a subtle drying sensation. In the end its a good, satisfying beer but nothing more than that.

Drinkability: Whats most impressive about BrewDog 5 A.M. Saint is the fact its remarkably robust for a 5% ABV beer. It has the full body of something bigger, though it is not a challenge to drink at all. Plenty of carbonation, energy and weight in the mouth followed by an easy finish. This is an ideal companion to food, but one on its own is good too.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

2385,"2012-05-07",3.7,"Bottle [330ml] at Rhino. Pours a deep ruby with a large lasting frothy off-white head. Nice aroma of caramel malt, a good amount of fruity hops along with resin and piney hops, some pepper and pumpernickel. Spicy, malty flavour with a good amount of hops along with some fruit and bread. Surprisingly spicy. Decent bitter finish.  Average bodied. For an Amber Ale this is really good, I quite enjoyed it.

2385,"2012-04-10",3.4,"330ml Bottle, best before 16 Jan 2012, drank and reviewed on 16 Aug 2011.

Before I start the proper review: Im not a fan of the way these brewers seek notice, but Ive had a few of their beers and although not seeking them out, dont shy away from them either. Ill try and be objective, not subjective.

This bottle is to be poured into a Back Forty Beer Co straight sided sleeve glass: got to be fair, it looked good, true amber body, clear and inviting, on top an off-white head that was full and creamy on the mouth.

Malty molasses filled the nose when taking in the smells, not roasted or toasted, burnt or otherwise, just an over-riding aroma of semi-sweet molasses.

The taste and mouthfeel were/are one of smooth maltiness without the over-sweetness sometimes found in other malty brews. A rich, almost creamy Mild (UK Dark Mild that is) sort of feel to it.

Would love to complain or bitch about it, but I enjoyed this beer: I prefer the slightly sweeter, maltier beers to the hoppy bitter ones normally and this slotted into my tastebuds well.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

Nose: dried peaches and apricots. Melba crunch. White and pink grapefruit. Lemon peel and lemon zest. Orange peel and orange zest. Lime. Crunchy caramelization.

Palate: bitter up front with lots of zippy rind, peel, and zest of lemon, lime, orange, and grapefruit  ohmy! Sweetness underneath is crunchy caramelized apple skin and melba toast goodness. Vegetable bitterness atop the middle of my tongue, then its gone. White and pink grapefruit in the finish  fresh and unsweetened with tingly acidity. Parching and thirst inducing at the same time. Lemon and lime zest.

2385,"2012-02-13",3.4,"12 oz bottle.  Pours a light rust color.  Faint aroma of hops, caramel.  Flavor was heavy on the malts - toffee, caramel, citrus.  All in all, this was good.  Perhaps a little watery for my preference.   The ridiculous message on the bottle begs for a snotty review, but the beer stands on its own, despite the narsassistic rumblings on the bottle.","Poway, California, USA","Naven"
2385,"2012-02-10",3.6,"Had ad bottle a Bottle Screw Bills in YYC while rushing for a Red Arrow bus. Hazy, medium amber body with a good-sized, off-white, fully lasting head that covers the glass in lacing. Good start! Super fruity aroma that is all hops, for the most part grapefruit, but there might be some pine and resin there as well. Despite the hoppy aroma the taste is initially light sweet, thats a nice touch! Then the finish comes, and it is of course aggressively bitter and delicious. A subtle sweet malty caramel flavour is followed and partially mixed with a firm grapefruit flavour. Medium body, soft carbonation, quite dry feel. Its a bit like a more complex, more interesting, beefed-up and hoppy version of an Amber Ale. Fucking doctors strike again.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","gramity"
2385,"2012-02-09",3.7,"Bottled. Pours deep amber with a head that goes fast. Immediate release of a pungent, floral, hoppy aroma which is the most striking feature of the beer.

2385,"2012-02-06",3.7,"Half pint at Euston Tap, Euston Road, London.  As is typical of the BrewDog range this has a strong, fruity aroma mixed with hops - berries this time as opposed to some of its more tropical fruit-based label mates.  It doesnt smell like you expect beer to smell, which is either a good thing or a bad thing depending on your sensibilities; for me its the former.  The taste is a big surprise - definite hints of cocoa mixed in with the fruity hops.  A little fizzy in the mouth so perhaps not as smooth on the palate as it could be but still rather good.","Bromsgrove (via Leicester), Worcestershire, ENGLAND","foxo82"

Doughy and bready undertones with a hint of caramel. The flavour is dry, medium bitter and tiny acidic. Metal/copper tones up front with grapefruit citric undertones. The mouthfeel is empty with a soft carbonation. Abrupt finish, only a touch of bitterness lingers. Light to medium bodied.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","Marsiblursi"

Way better than punk as i find its getting too much like lilt! Top!","","Firefly54"
2385,"2012-02-03",4.1,"5 A.M. Saint pours a clear reddish dark amber.  A huge two finger head is poured and sticks around for ages.  When I was done with this brew, it left a ton of lacing throughout.  The smell on this one is lovely.  Full of citrus and piney hops with a little bit of a grapefruit aroma.  I believe this one has 4 kinds of hops in it.  Chinook, Simcoe, Nelson Sauvin, and Centennial.  A really nice mixture.  A nice backbone of caramel malt

Bottom line on the taste is that its one of the best sessionable tasting beers Ive ever had.  I noticed more of a ESB kind of taste then I did in the aroma.  Still Id say this is Red Ale.  A really nice drop hopped taste up front.  Citrus and grapefruit.  But the dry hopped part of the beer just hit the spot for me.  Mixed in their is the caramel malt a nice sweetness.  The beer ends with a slight bitterness.  Its a very hoppy and clean taste.

Brew Dog me ha sorprendido gratamente con su linea base de cervezas, ya que todas poseen un gran balance tanto en aroma como en sabor; simplemente deliciosas.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a very dark brownish amber with a huge, foamy, sudsy and rocky, tan head that very slowly diminished and left excellent and very clumpy lacing. The aroma had moderate to heavy caramel and hints of tea; light to moderate grassy and metallic hops; lighter pine hops; toffee and cola. The initial flavor was light to moderately sweet and lightly bitter; while the finish was lightly sweet, moderately bitter and light to moderately sour with a little longer than average duration. There was caramel malt, grassy and metallic hops and a little sour fruit. The medium body was a little syrupy, but also somewhat oily with lightly fizzy carbonation and a metallic and slightly chalky finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

2385,"2011-07-12",3.9,"Where to begin... Hazy, muddy, ruby color with a cream colored, full, creamy, dense head which settles to a thin lasting layer and leaves thick, drippy lace.  The nose is simcoe mostly with passionfruit and rustic, but also smaller notes of pine, pink grapefruit, kiwi, and faint spice and floral.  The flavor is a bit of a let down with not enough malt presence or bitterness to match the intense hop flavors; less than moderate bitterness, light toasted caramel, still some rustic, light floral, and pink grapefruit.  The palate is medium, soft to lively, slightly dry, and a bit watery.  The beer finishes slightly dry, toasty, piney, rustic, and some grapefruit lingering.  Certainly the hoppiest table strength beer I have had to date, as much hop flavor as many imperial IPA.  I would like to have a bit more bitterness and strength (ie an IPA or imperial pale) because the hop flavors worked very well in this one.  Nice one.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

I was expecting it to be creamy and sweet and then a riot of hops. Instead it was fresh, light and then a cool flow of hoppy grassy bitterness that swills around the mouth and lingers on the palate. While it does the malt character makes itself known with a polite cough. What I like about this beer is that it promises one thing, delivers another, but it delivers.

A pleasant, fruity combination of grapefruit & pine with maybe a little mango in the middle. Definitely a good smelling, summery beer.

Starts off very fruity to begin with a grapefruit dominating along with a citrus flavour before easing out in the middle then finishing with the pine mentioned in the smell. Well balanced overall & finishing with a warm, mildly bitter aftertaste.

Medium bodied, smooth and easy to drink making this a nice session brew. The carbonation is good too.

This is a very pleasant, fruity beer that goes down well & would be perfect on a warm summers day. Not the best Brewdog offering but still a nice brew. - - - -

2385,"2011-04-15",4.5,"Single bottle purchased from Kensington Wine Market sometime in March, 2011. Colour: Clouded orange with generous heaps of orange-tinged pillowy head. Nose: A dominant blend of hops and Lindt milk chocolate. After some time and swirling, raw mushrooms and fresh lawn clippings appear. The rich milk chocolate stays constant even as it opens up. Taste: Medium light sweet, medium bitter, light sour. Not nearly as sweet as the nose would have you believe because the chocolote is now bittersweet. Emerging fruits come on, dark cherries and kiwi. Hops act as a blanket around everything though, as they pulsate in all areas of the palate. This is the most extensively hopped amber I have ever tasted, and it works like a young married couple.

2385,"2011-04-11",4.1,"Wow what a beer!  This has taken over the top spot on my list for lower ABV beers, surpassing the old number one: San Diego County Session Ale by Stone/Kelsey Mcnair/BP

The aroma of hop perfume and caramel starts this beer off right.  Not the strongest aroma, but a pleasant one.

Look is a orangey-golden hue, with red tones.  Dense, tan head.

The taste is out of this world.  At only 25 IBU, this beer still imparts a strong hop taste.  The essential oils of the hops were heavily extracted, but the bittering alpha acids have a much smaller influence.  This yeilds a strong hop sensation, without being a resinous palate-buster.

The strong hop character balances a caramel sweetness of the malt bill, which is, simply put, out of this world.  The Maris Otter variety of pale malt gives this beer a distinctive English ale taste, with a rich mouthfeel and wonderful flavor.  There must have been considerable amounts of unfermentable sugars in the mash, because the beer has a noticeable sweetness. This also comes through better because of the low bitterness and low alcohol.  I love this beer because the balance between the malty sweetness and bitterness is perfect, but it isnt a strictly noble hop taste.  Its almost like a cross between an English pale ale and and an American pale ale.  It has the American style hop presence, but the English malty sweetness.  

The mouthfeel was a medium to full feel with a soft carbonation that is certainly enough to give the beer life, but not prickly by any means.  

Overall its pretty much the perfect session ale in my book.  This is a winner, and an excellent value.  If you find it on the shelf at your local beer store, you absolutely must pick it up.","","alexjucla"

2385,"2011-04-02",3.3,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2016 Time for a re-assessment of this beer, which I rated the first time almost five years ago only two months after joining RateBeer. Availability has strangely diminished since then as the beer was pulled from Danish supermarket shelves in 2014/15. This one comes courtesy of a keg at Taphouse Copenhagen. It was poured at fridge temperature into a big shaker glass and allowed to stand for twenty minutes while I consumed a dark saison and a cheese and ham panini. Looking at the beer it is strangely more hazy than I remember it. It used to be possible to see the underside of the foam cap when looking through the glass and all I see now is a cloudy, dark amber body. The head is largely subsided after twenty mintues but there is still solid, off-white film and some decent lace. The beer shows decent regeneration when swirling the glass but alas the head fades after 10 seconds. The aroma has some fruity soda pop impressions but its a bit hard to detect the Nelson Sauvin hop in this pour. I get a bit of fruit juice but its more of a subtle undercurrent than an overpowering in your face expression. The flavour has the familiar caramel and fruit character but it seems less harmonic than I remember it. On the palate there is a medium body with soft carbonation, oily texture and a caramelly sweet finish. Its an okay beer but not as great and supremely sessionable as I remember it. Also now its 8 euro for 40 cl...

April 2nd 2011: (on bottle, 33 cl from SuperBrugsen) Pours a slightly hazy deep amber with long-lasting, tall and frothy off-white head that laces the glass. Intense, complex aroma of floral hops. Taste is rich with what for me is the perfect balance of intense bitterness and a certain malty sweetness. Full-bodied, oily with average carbonation and a long, dry and bitter sweetness. Something close to the perfect beer for me - and at less than two euro its a steal.

non abbondante, bianca, scompare in fretta
COLORE:
ambrato con riflessi rosso-arancio
INTENSITA / FINEZZA / AROMA
molto intensa, si avverte già al versare la birra nel bicchiere. È una esplosione di note fruttate, dominate da una componente di frutta esotica (direi frutto della passione) che si mescola per bene con note citriche/agrumate e un tocco di vegetale. Ce sicuramente spazio per  un piccolo contributo dei malti - caramello, tostato - però rimane schiacciato dal profumo fruttato. 
GUSTO / RETROGUSTO / PERSISTENZA
i profumi si convertono in sapori proseguendo per la stessa strada. In tal caso, peró, il frutto esotico tende a convertirsi più che altro in pompelmo rosa, sulla spinta di un amaro consistente dal carattere erbaceo/citrico. I malti fanno fatica a farsi notare, dando qualche nota caramellata e di frutto secco che si mischia con il fruttato iniziale, ma il finale è tutto per i luppoli con un retrogusto erbaceo persistente.
CORPO / CARBONATAZIONE / CONSISTENZA
corpo medio-basso, carbonatazione media; in bocca da una sensazione di fluidità e freschezza.buona, piacevole e sorprendente - allnizio - poi, a dire la verità, le note fruttate tropicali stancano un po e comunque rendono la birra di difficile abbinamento a tavola (una birra da aperitivo estivo?). Per fortuna gli amaricanti dei luppoli evolvono attenuando i toni piu dolciastri del fruttato iniziale. Concludendo, una birra originale, ben fatta e ben costruita su luppoli di prima qualita; il resto è questione di gusti.","(Madrid","molly75"

2385,"2011-03-21",2.6,"Color daurat rogenc. Lescuma (i no dic crema) és de color mantega, no gaire densa. Al principi pareix molt estable, però com passa amb les cerveses amb bona retenció i poca densitat, aviat es produeix un ""iceberg"" o ""cràter"" i les vores baixen a un ritme molt major que el centre, creant una illa descuma daspecte no gaire atractiu. Malmet una mica laspecte general de la cervesa. Tot i que visualment poc agraciada, perdura fins el final.
En nas, els llúpols arriben de seguida, molt intensament. Resina de pi i cítrics en clau daranja... aquesta ale mira cap a més enllà de lAtlàntic! Són aromes potents i agradables i perduren fins el final molt estables. Quan la cervesa guanya uns graus de temperatura, van destapant-se  (o evolucionant) altres aromes fruitals més madurs, però queden aclaparats pel caràcter resinós que domina.
La 5AM, al meu parer, on fa aigües (literalment) és en boca. És aiguada i, això, no lliga ni amb laspecte ni amb laroma ni amb lestil no estil. A més, és una sensació de decepció que marriba tan bon punt faig el primer glop, ja que en els aromes es defenia molt bé i feia goig. És també vivament carbonatada i això no dóna joc tampoc. Junt a laigualiment, amb el glop, marriba un regust àcid lleugerament proper a la llimona que no sé ben bé on situar. És amarga, però no tant per la intensitat com perquè lamargor perdura molt, però és seca i bastant plana. Poc a poc va destapant-se i es torna més afruitada, però el llúpol tan marcadament americà no acaba de combinar amb la resta.
Jo, no li trobo la gràcia a aquesta cervesa. Em sembla que no està ben arrodonida i té alguns defectes marcats com la sensació daigualit.

The flavor, although good, is less impressive.  Its a bit thin.  The amber malt and hops are certainly there, just not in the rich level that they display themselves in in the aroma.  It is weak on the palate.  Its very low carbonation, which is what i normally like, but it is just watery thin.  Not light bodied, but thin somehow.

2385,"2010-12-22",2.6,"UPDATED: DEC 6, 2014 
Dec, 2010 Bottle. Whats an Amber Ale? Its a pale ale brewed with a proportion of crystal malt to give the beer an amber colour. The Americans use the term, the French do as well. We used to use the term in the UK, but havent really done so for many years. None of the beers that are generally termed Amber Ale fit this beer, so Im not quite sure what the BrewDog guys are thinking of. This is in the American IPA style - its rather more hoppy than an APA, though the abv is more in keeping with that style. However, the use of crystal malt has given this a certain dryness and a rough edge and a depth of malt character that is interesting. Usually brewers like to balance big hops with a lot of clean, sweet, juicy pale malt, so this is a little different. It is, though, more of a take on IPA than on Amber Ale - perhaps Imperial Amber Ale? Anyway, it often takes me a while to appreciate BrewDog beers and big hoppy beers, so I dont expect to enjoy this on first visit. And my expectation was fulfilled. Its drinkable, but its not my thing. Too dry, and too filtered and lifeless, and too much relying on hops. Beer is about the malt - the hops are a flavouring.  [2.6]
Dec, 2014 330ml dark bottle. 5 A.M. Saint 5%.  Filtered. From Grande Wines, Woolston. Dry red beer, filtered, with hops. Lots of amusing hype on the bottle that some people like and others hate. Most brewers do it. Generate a brand loyalty. This is not a brand image I personally buy into, and I dont like boring lifeless beers which generate their only interest from throwing in excessive flavourings of one sort or another. And hops are one such flavouring. I love beer when magic occurs between the malt and the yeast. Theres no magic here. Its drinkable, but its not my thing.

In terms of looks, it really is hard to get any better than this beer. The aroma is not quite at that level, yet it is still very attractive, with strong pine and citrus notes from the hops, and the merest hint of nutty malt. This vanishes as one tastes the beer, however, as there is almost no detectable malt in the flavour; its a veritable hop-monster. Initial citrus hops dominate, with strong pine notes coming into play later. The palate, however, is perhaps ever so slightly too bitter. It is very interesting to see a darker ale such as this with such a hop focus, rather than being malt-driven. There are some quite interesting hops varieties in here too, with the Simcoe being particularly noticeable in the initial taste. For one such as myself, who enjoys a thoroughly hoppy beer, this is excellent, yet I can see that it is not the most approachable beer out there, and that it could potentially be a bit much for some.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"

The aroma bursts with a variety of hop incarnations, including citrus, herbal, floral, grassy, resinous and citrus notes. The malt character is dominant in the caramel and bread department, showing minor hints of oxidation and muddling. The flavor holds nutty caramel malt with bready biscuit notes and resinous bittering hops. Some tropical juicy fruit and citrus also makes an appearance. The hop character is certainly nothing like the aroma would suggest, but its pretty tasty. The palate is medium bodied for the style with low effervescence and an acidic, resinous finish.

This is a nicely hoppy beer with good British malt flavor.  The aroma from the hops is floral, pine and citric, in that order, while the malt contributes lots of biscuity, doughy caramel goodness.  The malt aroma holds its own against the hops with a luxurious depth, differentiating the beer from most American ambers and such.  This is a hoppy ESB.  The flavor is rich and full.  Theres a lot of good British beer flavor.  Its not quite as bursting at the seams of its size but close.  Mouthfeel is a tad slick.  The aftertaste is hoppy and bitter.

2385,"2010-06-22",3.9,"12oz bottle, purchased at City Beer. Pours a deep, generally clear, ruby-orange color; significant light-tan head with good retention and lacing. The English malt character shows through pretty clearly in the aroma (biscuity, some caramel) alongside grassy, piney, and citrusy hop character; nicely complex hop aroma, and definitely comes across on the English side of the equation despite the American-style hopping; that caramel note and Marris Otter maltiness are quite persistent; seems nicely dry from the nose. Medium to medium-light body; average levels of carbonation; very light creaminess, with no astringency or alcohol; the mouthfeel as a whole is pretty close to perfect, and I could see myself sessioning a whole lot of this under other circumstances; the caramel and biscuity malt core is well-expressed and nicely dry, while the hopping is just excellent and tempered: citrus, pine, and floral notes, and theres the grassiness from the dry hopping evident throughout; lightly bitter overall, and just hugely drinkable. Beautifully done, and a great rendition of a style thats just so damn difficult to find fresh in the States these days. Dig it. Medium, toasty finish, showing hints of marshmallow (that soft, malty core), biscuity notes, and a lingering citrus / grassy hop bitterness.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Toasted malts with some earthy toffee dominate with some light chocolate and black pepper notes following.  Hops consist of light mango and citrus, light grass, and just smells of overbitteredness.  Flavor is grassy and earthy, some peppery notes again with too much bittering hops.  There is some of the toffee again and plenty of the dirty earthy notes (redundant).  Burps unsalted saltine crackers.  Once it warmed the hops turned a little fruitier, but nothing could make up for the finish.  Dirty dirty bitterness peaking at a 7, dry.  Medium to high carbonation with a medium body.  I think theyre mistaking bucketloads of dry hops with too much friggin bittering hops to make this not very drinkable and a waste of hops/$.

Thinner mouthfeel, low to moderate carbonation, faintly sweet with a good balance of malt and hop character. The beer only finishes moderately bitter; clearly the hops are almost all aromatic.  Really smooth.  The bitter definitely starts to build up as you drink it though, and by the end of the 12oz I was glad to switch to something else.

2385,"2010-05-21",4.2,"11.2 ounce bottle, Batch 483, best before January 19, 2011.  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a reddish/amber color with about an inch off-white head.  The bottle was a bit of a gusher when I opened it, but it didnt take long to settle down and make a decent pour.  Head retention and lacing are both very good.  Aroma is nice and hoppy, the brew smells mostly like pine and citrusy (grapefruit, tropical fruit) hops, along with a bit of caramel malt.  Taste is the same as the aroma, but the citrusy hops come out stronger in the taste compared to the other flavors.  Theres also a good lingering bitter hoppy finish.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium, its a bit slick and has good carbonation.  Drinkability is pretty good, this is quite a sessionable brew!

2385,"2009-11-19",3.8,"Oh yes, what a beer! Interestingly I tried Nanny State a couple days before this, and it seems to me that Nanny State is essentially a low alcohol super heavy hop version of this very beer, as the Hop flavour in this brew is almost identical. Anyhoo. Looks great in the glass, nothing overly fancy but a great deep rusty copper colour with a light tan head, which is quite creamy looking. The aroma is just sublime, perhaps not as sublime as Punk IPA on draught, but still great. Really spicy aroma with all the floral, wild strawb, orange, grapefruit notes you could ask for. The flavour is excellent, this is as close to a Stone beer in terms of flavour that Ive ever come in the UK. It has that same blend of Spice, earth and mineral that Stone has, Ive not tasted that harmonious blend in many other beers, or at least not as close as this. Flavour is pink grapefruit, floral, resinous, spicy maybe ginger? Some citrus but more like sour blood orange. Then in comes slate, mineral, pepper, earth almost a burnt acrid flavour in the background. Palate is great, conditioning is great, could be a little fuller bodied, but Im not gonna gripe about that, thats just a personal thing, body still remains creamy and balanced. Overall a great beer, quite possibly my favourite Brewdog beer so far, is it because it reminds me alot of a US beer - I suspect so - but that doesnt detract from Brewdog, as it shows we here in the UK can Punch at that kind of weight class, its just a shame theres so few Breweries with this kind of assertive, gutsy approach. The beer still tastes quintessentially British/Scottish (dont want to step on any toes here) but has some serious power and flavour behind it. Reminds me alot of Stones ""Levitation."" This is possibly a landmark in UK brewing, have I gone hyperbole mad? Perhaps, but this is what good beer is all about.","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"

2385,"2009-08-09",4.1,"Cask, gravity at the White Horse, Hedgerley, Bucks 08-08-09 on leg seven of the Thames Tipple   The landlord Kevin very kindly brought us out a half pint of this to sample, I then had another half before we left the pub as it came on. Pours copper with a  slight haze and an off white head. This had the most magnificent hoppy aroma, grapefruit was all over your nostrils like a rash. Flavours were very grapefruit, incredibly fruity and with long dry finish, nice full on bitterness, so tangy and tasty, all of our group loved this beer and so did I.

Pours deep amber with a small, creamy, off-white head. Aroma has strawberries, peach, pine and subdued caramel. Prickly, great carbonation, super dry mouthfeel. Flavour is just great as well. Soft, yet hard bitterness, resiny hops, strawberries, nuts, peach, grapefruity and pine. Caramel background. Super malt balance with a light citric touch to the finish. Very nice!","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"
