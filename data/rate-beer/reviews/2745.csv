2745,"2012-10-08",4.1,"Times are bad at Mikkeller Bar. Were all out of Vesterbro Pils, the tumbleweeds are a-blowing, oh what a pilsner-desert! But behold!, here comes Amnecia. With an aroma bursting with Nelson and Amarillo on top of a crisp crusty malt note - the mouths are drooling again. The pints are a-flowin with Amnecia. All kinds of citrus fruit notes make the taste - orange, tangerine, lime zest, pineapple. Its like the hops almost add a tartness, because this beer is so citrusy. Im afraid that the almighty Colossus of Vesterbro Pils now has a worthy opponent. Tore and Tobias are gonna invade Mikkeller Bar, and take over the empire. Bartenders be summoned, grab yer sword and defend! Were not going down without a fight!","Copenhagen (formerly Aalborg), DENMARK","phredrik"
