4356,"2015-11-29",4.2,"Bottle 500ml. Poured into a nonic pint glass. Initially served too cold so aroma was suppressed.

Tight cream coloured foam, which was about a finger width and held nicely leaving lacing all the way down the glass. Fairly mild sweetness but full tasting. Silky, velvety smooth palate. Short to medium finish with the fruitcake flavour coming in again at the finish, followed by a hint of alcohol which adds to the boozy fruitcake feel.

Quite sweet and very fruity smelling with some strong earthy malts and sugar. There are a few hops in there too and lots of toffee and maybe even a little banana amongst other fruits fighting to be noticed. The sweetness is pleasant and the aroma seems quite well balanced.

Chestnut brown colour with a part bubbly, part foamy head that is off-white to very light brown in colour. There appears to be plenty of carbonation and nice retention.

Very sweet and sugary with a lot of different fruits in there, amongst them is some banana and figs along with a little hint of toffee as well as some vanilla. I also detected some earthy  malts and hops with a lingering sweetness that works really well.

Medium-full mouthfeel with a great, creamy texture and lots of sugary sweetness from the fruit. The beer has a sticky smoothness to it and is a lot more refreshing than you would imagine.

Really nice and well balanced beer that has a great sweet, fruity taste to it with a wonderful body. This one goes down really well and is excellent to take your time with. I usually shy away from English style ales but this one is definitely one I can see myself going back to.

4356,"2011-03-28",3.2,"Appearance: Dark copper/ruby red, slightly hazy. Noticeable carbonation. Forms a generous, off-white, soapy head - good retention and lacing.

Smell: Generic ESB scent with slight toasted cereal malts and hints of red fruit. Noticeable skunky/oxidation scent as well - not extremely foul, quite subtle, and easy to block out.

Taste: It took a few swigs to get used to the palate on this beer. It started out quite sharp and tangy, but eventually smoothened out to a more traditional ESB role. Mild palate for the most part, especially the first half. Theres slight toasted cereal malts and a surprisingly creamy texture and flavor. The second half is lightly bitter with a quick sour tang taste that leaves as quickly as it arrives. As the beer warms it becomes more fruity with red apple notes. Not a dry beer by any means, though. Not the tastiest palate in the world, and as a pub-style ale it works - nothing more, nothing less.

Drinkability: Perfectly medium-bodied in weight and density. Soft, somewhat cold mouthfeel that never dries out. Actually becomes more refreshing as it warms as the flavors begin to mature. The 6.3% ABV seems right on the money, although I could imagine sessioning this beer no problem - especially with pub fare.

Overall, not the best ESB on the market as it seems to have a few kinks to work out. But it is a solid performer in the end. I think this particular beer might be for more refined tastes than mass audiences, though.

I was surprised by the dry hop character to the flavour given the aroma. Medium mouthfeel with a tolerable level of carbonation for the style. Sticky and sweet fruity malt elements become more apparent in the aftertaste to add some decent complexity. Quite a tasty one, with some aspects I have never come across before in an ESA.

Flavour is where the beer really shines, with a complex bouquet of dark fruits mingling with a slightly woody hop presence and a hint of treacle.  Warming alcohol at the back of the throat.

Aroma of caramel and wet malt grains. Initial flavor has a blend of toffee and caramel, with just a hint of nuts. This is countered by a soft spicy and herbal hop middle. More bitterness on the finish compared to the cask, and perhaps more tea notes as well. While this has a tad more heft, I found the cask more enjoyable as it was fresh and smoother on the finish. Pasteurization takes away some of the qualities I like in  this beer. However, this bottles much better than many other British beers.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"

As I had the cask version just the night before, this was very interesting for me - the aroma is fairly deep roast malt, apple and light prune, lushly grainy and enough dry floral hops to keep it from seeming overly sweet; some alcohol on the nose.  The taste - even roastier, the floral hops are losing the battle, but this is a lovely caramel/light molasses malt beer with nice cool weather spice in the finish - excellent taste, enough raisin character to almost seem vinous, or even mildly port-like.  Solid body, a little sticky, nice carbonation, and enough alcohol to remind you this is WAY stronger than the cask version - as quaffable as the cask is, I really prefer this in the bottle, pasteurized or not (shock:  I dont give much more than a micrometrical crap about pasteurization/non-pasteurization).

4356,"2007-07-26",3.0,"A softly pleasing, oft confusing Strong ale from a brewery that I do love. This beer just lacked flavour integration personally, though I must say it did fill a void. At just on cool, into an Adnams pint. It pours a very deep, ruddy copper, hazy from the ill-fated yeast and abundant in very fine, minute streams of bubbles. The head, an impressive half inch of off-white whipped cream. It attains for the length and daubs the glass in sudsy rings. Sweet, gooey, fresh-baked, sultana-rich dumplings in a hot toffee and marzipan sauce is the best I could gather from the aroma. Sorry! Yes it does smell lip-smacking good. A few tiers down from the aroma is the taste, disappointingly. The palate is quite frothy, the body difficult to judge. Ripe plums meet bitter burnt fruit, some burnt toast also. Front is a bit washed up - some feint roasted almonds; the back a little salty and the finish has more acrid, burnt fruit, some raisin-bread prominent to dull the transition. Alcohol is in hiding, it doesnt warm the cockles the way I wanted it to. Some residue of sweet and burnt fruits linger on the lips and palate.  Quite aside itself, I couldnt quite get into this.

Hazelnut and sharp lemon and orange scents. Brown-ale-esque in aroma, but stronger and more hoppy than a typical brown. Overall, the aroma is appropriately very English. Pours a deep brown with an orange tint. The shade of the color is darker toward the top and lighter toward the bottom. Large amount of thick, uneven, light tannish-cream-colored head. Produces extensive lacing. Flavor dominated by a roasted bitterness and dirty hops. Nuts and tobacco tastes as well, with a touch of raisin. Roasted bitter aftertaste. Light to medium body. Soft in the palate. Surprisingly low in carbonation, given the large head. Overall, like a cross between a porter and a bitter. Adnams Broadside is an okay but not great beer.

The nuts can only be notified vaguely in the taste, but this is probably a good thing that keeps the beer from being too sweet and complex. The aftertaste is at first marked by a great bitter hopping, but it dissapears pretty fast to let the cherries dominate for a while. Then an unfortunate acrid taste is appearing. A big shame.

An interesting variety of flavors, well matched and balanced.  Loads of English character in this one, and a real pleasure to drink.

4356,"2006-06-04",4.0,"(12 oz bottle: $2.49 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) Lot Number 5069 14:56.  I had Adnams Broadside on cask a couple years ago and was mightily underwhelmed by what seemed to be the ultimate lunch beer (meaning, go back to work with no buzz!).  I was fully expecting Broadside Original to be the same beer in a bottle, but Ive never been so mistaken.  This beer is awesome!  The sweet, caramely and toasty malts, the plentiful toffee, and natural molasses are rich and very delicious, and the hoppy bitterness adds much-appreciated balance.  The flavor is reinforced by the sweet, caramely, malty and buttery nose, and the round, full-bodied mouthfeel.  Based on the flavor and mouthfeel as well as the lot number, Ill hazard a guess that this beer is over a year old, and if so, its aged beautifully.  Carbonation is light to moderate, but there is still a nice zing on the palate.  Moderate bite in the finish keeps the palate alive and interesting too.  Supposedly pasteurized, there is a fair amount of muddy sediment in the bottom of the bottle.  The clear, deep, ruby-colored body, the sizeable, creamy, beige head, and the partial curtain of lace complete what is one all-around terrific beer.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Strong toasty malt and more of the big bitterness, this time with wood notes, finish it off.  Bitterness and esters linger forever.

Creamy nose with dark fruits (raspberry and blackberry) and hints of spruce / pine. Amazing red-brown looks. Kinda like a kriek but darker.

4356,"2004-10-16",4.1,"500ml bottle BBD26NOV04  Pours ruby red, nice tan head, very bubbly(poured at 58*F).  Floral, fruity hops(or is it yeast?) and a strong malt aroma.  Very well balanced beer, largely malty, hops add the neccesary vaguely citirc, peppery spice.  British beer often seem to confound me b/c the yeast? and/or hops? seem to give many of them a very similiar drinking experience and its one I struggle to describe.  None the less, this is a big, bold beer and very good.  Perhaps an ESB?  Id love to suck down some pints of this from the cask, appears that version is much weaker in ABV though, obviously different.  Id buy more bottles of it if I see it again.

4356,"2004-10-16",3.8,"Again I was impressed with this brewery! I truly enjoyed the SSB, and the Broadside was equally as nice an English Ale. 
 Poured a dark amber body and a nice frothy ivory colored head. The aroma was a cornucopia of fruit, apricots, plums, pears, and red apple, even some tangerine. There was a nice punch of hops in the flavor some well toasted malts.. a note of doughy yeastiness. Suggestions of caramel were abundant, and the palate was rich and fluffy a really nice brew! I still cant believe Id passed these bottles up in the store for so many months.

4356,"2004-10-02",2.6,"Note: The beer I drank was 6.3% abv.

The colour is dark red-brown, and the foam is medium thick, yellowish and quite soft.

The smell is sweet and filled with fresh hops. There are flavours of hay and mint, too.

The carbon dioxide is kind of strong for ale, and it fades away quickly.

The taste is somewhat metallic, dry, burnt with hints of apricot. The taste of alcohol is not hidden very well, and the straightforward, dry bitterness is almost too powerful.

The aftertaste is plain bitterness with burnt hints, but it is surprisingly short. After just a few minutes, there is nothing left at all.

I must say that this beer makes me a little disappointed: I expected a well-crafted, complex and generous strong ale, but what I got was just an aggressive yet plain bitterness with a taste of alcohol that belongs to much cheaper beers.","Linköping, SWEDEN","bark"

This is maybe the best-smelling beer Ive ever had: caramel popcorn, a bit of yeast, and butter toffee were strong in the nose.

The taste was similar with chocolate malts, dark skinned fruits, rum raisins, and charred wood.  The hops were restrained, but provided a peppery kick and a dry mouthfeel.

Light almonds, mixed with toffee, cherries, dark candi and a hint of oak in the flavor. Enough bitterness in the fnish to keep the sweetness in check.
