1479,"2017-02-08",4.6,"EBF 2017. This is incredible. It has an absurd amount of flavor, to the point that it nearly overwhelms your taste buds, but the really impressive thing is that Kane has managed to keep things balanced and nuanced, so that new flavors (coffee, cinnamon) keep popping in and out throughout the sip. Maple syrup flavor and sweetness dominate. It reminds me in taste and in quality of execution of Canadian Breakfast Stout. Its unreal how good this is.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

1479,"2017-01-14",4.1,"Draft at MBCP 2017. Nose is huge cinnamon with light spice. Light fudge. Taste follows with a medium to strong cinnamon. Light dark chocolate notes. Really enjoyable. Not too overly roasty","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
1479,"2017-01-09",4.7,"Pours black and oily with a giant dark brown head.

Has an incredibly intense and unique nose, bursting of roasted coffee, a luscious amount of cinnamon and sweet maple syrup. All adjuncts add up tremendously well, creating a flawless, stunning appearance. The aromas are mindblowingly intense, with dark chocolate, tobacco and warm fudge completing the nose.

Drinks supersoft and creamy, with a taste defining silkness. The chocolate in this adds perfectly to the cream, while its mouthfeel remains light, revealing a stunning depth of flavors at the same time. 

Tastes of peppery cinnamon and toffee, gently wrapped into milk chocolate and sweet maple syrup, giving even more edge to slowly evolving, wooden, dry, fresh crushed coffee beans. The interplay between roast and cream, sweet and dryness is intense - all flavors enrich each other and create an unbelievable flavor richness on the palate. The mouthfeel is almost too light for such an explosion on the tastebuds, which finishes long and dry, with syrup enhanced coffee and just the faintest spice push.

This is simply delicious! The adjuncts have been used in the most thoughtful fashion possible. The flavors almost overwhelm the palate, while at the same time you just cant stop drinking the beer to comprehend its uniqueness.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1479,"2016-10-16",3.8,"Thnx to Mike ! Pours very dark brown, small white head. Smell is cinnamon up front, some maple syrup. Taste is dry, cinnamon powder, some fullness thnx to the maple syrup. Dark malts, mild chocolate, some more cinnamon towards the aftertaste. more balanced than - for instance - hunnapuh, but still id like it to be less cinamon. Truly cool to try, complex as a whole and even unique. Anything youd want, accept for the cinnamon..","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"
1479,"2016-09-23",4.6,"Dark brown, near black body, beige collar. Lovely aroma of vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon, brown sugar, roast, coffee maple. Complexities abound. Terrific flavor. Elegantly balanced, with nuance in every sip. Light to medium sweetness that could never become cloying. All around superb beer.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
1479,"2016-08-18",4.1,"Bottle shared by Michael, thanks man! Pour is black with a smaller tan head. Aroma is bursting with coffee, toasted malt, chocolate, and a light sweetness - Oatmeal raisin cookie was mentioned and that is accurate, but with coffee. Aroma is stunning. Flavor is also coffee, toasted malt, and maple with a nice cinnamon kick. Cookies! Really nice.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
1479,"2016-08-12",4.1,"Bottle at New Glarus, thanks! Pours a near clear dark brown with a tan head that dissipates to the edges.

1479,"2016-07-19",3.8,"From notes. Got together at Dougs house on June 30 for a reason I cant recall. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a darker brown with a little bit of garnet shining in through the edge. The aroma is pretty cinnamon heavy. There is a light coffee and decent maple. The chocolate and cinnamon are the definite stars. Its a little messy. The cinnamon just controls. There is a little more balance in the flavor. Lighter cinnamon, coffee, chocolate, and a heavier dose of maple. This isnt too bad. The mouth feel is a little thin and light, and the carbonation is decent with it. The aftertaste is cinnamon and light chocolate and coffee. The maple fades quickly. Aside from the cinnamon dominance, this is a pretty tasty beverage.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate-heavy coffee, chocolate, light maple, and hints of cinnamon. It pours a dark brown with some faint orange highlights along the outer edges of the glass. It has a small brown head that fades to a minimal film outlined by a thin ring. The flavor starts with moderate chocolate and mild molasses. Moderate maple syrup comes in the middle. It mixes in the finish with light-moderate coffee and light cinnamon. Its medium-full bodied with soft carbonation and mouthfeel.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
1479,"2016-06-23",3.9,"What an interesting rating profile. Massive standard deviation here. I can see why. Bottle thanks to Steve. Pours a jet black color with a medium brown head. A huge sugary coffee nose. The flavor initially is overwhelming sugary spices, cinnamon. The coffee is massive and very milky sweet. The beer mellows a bit to vanilla, roast, some light dark fruit. Hmm. No doubt this is decadent and far too sugary for everyday. Id love to see this barrel aged. Solid beer, lots to love. Very smooth, very big flavors.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
1479,"2016-06-22",4.0,"750ml. I thought breweries were out of unique names for a breakfast stout. Nope. Sunday Brunch. Pitch black. Pretty standard imperial. Not much in the way of a head. Cinnamon dominates the nose and taste. Not quite abraxas levels but more cinnamon than some so called cinnamon stouts. There is some chocolate malt, a touch of maple sweetness. The flavors all play very well together. Very good stuff for a non BA stout.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
1479,"2016-06-20",4.4,"Bottle. Pours opaque deep brown with a huge, thick and stable khaki coloured head. Aromas of maple, molasses, vanilla, cinnamon fill the room.

Aroma is of , well a great breakfast, medium roast coffee, syrup, chocolate, light earthy smoke, cinnamon toast. Taste is right there with the aroma, nice medium roast coffee, cinnamon crunch toast, chocolate, some mild earthy notes, creamy sweetness, with a smooth silky body.

1479,"2015-03-24",3.6,"Un porter qui montre un contour rouge sang. Une tête bien belle dans les circonstances. Nez super intéressant de cappuccino et de brioche à la cannelle avec un soupçon de sirop dérable. Au goût, ça suit un peu difficilement mais cest tout de même bon. Goût malté avec une cannelle qui prend beaucoup de place. Corps étonnamment mince pour son ambition. Finale douce avec une touche cendrée.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

1479,"2014-06-08",3.7,"[ Keg ][ 8oz- ][ The Cambridge Philly ][ $5.50 ][ Mini Snifter ][ 6.6.14 ]
>> Pours ink core with red edges. Good coffee foam. Nose is really nice cinnamon graham cracker and spicy mocha. Powerful, rich, Hunahpu style. Taste is up front is on point with dark chocolate and cinnamon, but it devolves quickly into cigarette ash and sticky tootsie roll. This seems to be a brewery wide problem for Kane where their highly rated dark stuff suffers from the same palate/mouthfeel/finish. Needs recipe tweaking.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
1479,"2014-06-07",4.3,"On tap at Cambridge for PBW. Pours a black color with caramel colored head. Aroma of maple syrup, cinnamon, coffee, and chocolate. Wow, what a taste.

1479,"2014-05-30",3.4,"Draft. Pours black with no head. Aroma is mostly coffee up front with just a hint of cinnamon. Taste flips those proportions and adds a hint of maple in the finish. Rich slick mouthfeel. Solid.","","conway"
1479,"2014-05-24",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2015 Draft at the brewery 5/24/14 from an extra keg they didnt realize they still had. Dark cola brown. Aroma is incredible - dank cinnamon right out of a cafe with the best French toast on the planet. The taste hits every detail of chocolate, maple syrup, coffee, and cinnamon. The body is medium thin and maintains the rich desert like flavor. Overall, an excellent variant and amazing beer. ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone","Middletown, New Jersey, USA","John25"

1479,"2014-04-26",4.0,"Growler from the brewery. Poured like regular MB deep black body with an average sized frothy light beige head. Aroma is great. The cinnamon is super prevalent that brings lots of sweetness to balance out the coffee and adds a bit of dark chocolate and burnt toast. Flavor is very good with lots of cinnamon, light vanilla and chcolate sweetness from the maple and finishes with coffee. Really well done.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
