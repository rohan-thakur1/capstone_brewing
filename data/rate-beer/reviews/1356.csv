Aroma; a bit hard to distinguish since the brewer was checking a boil kettle only about 12 M away, releasing a fine aroma of boiled malt. Anyway, the beer itself smelt of dark malt and spicy hops.

1356,"2012-01-18",3.0,"Draft at the brewpub, Summer 2011.  The pour gives a hazy, dark, chestnut-mahogany body with glints of  red around he edges.  A thick, spongy head of beige froth lasts a good long while, leaving sticky splotches of lacing behind.  The nose is of simple, bready, bronzed sugars with notes of caramel, toasted bread, and cocoa.  Theres a touch of a nickely sort of mineral character amidst the dark, malty bread sugars.  Flavors follow suit, bready and toasty, clearly featuring the dark malt with all of its toasted caramel edges, roast, and mildly bittersweet cocoa.  A bit of floral hop character shows on the back end.  The palate sports a moderate, easy going body that finishes with some crisp acidity and lively, cleaning carbonation.

1356,"2010-07-12",4.0,"Draught @ the brewpub. Easily my favourite of the Tmave Ive had up to now. That one wore a dense, huge beige head that could hold a coin atop its coke-coloured, veiled body. Chocolatey, toasty and gently nutty nose that is surprisingly aromatic for a dark lager. The engaging leafy hops help. The mouthfeel is ridiculously round, yet it feels light, simply enveloping your mouth and never disturbing you with anything resembling agressive carbonation. Top add to my satisfastion, it is dry despite its ample body and just keeps putting on its chocolatey show after you,ve swallowed. Impressive to pack so much in a single pint. Sure the place is expensive for Prague, but that level of quality is rare even among Czech land.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

How: Tap at brewpub (Klásterní Pivovar Strahov, Prague)
The look: Black body with medium beige head
To me a typical Czech Tmavé (Czech Black Lager) is: Dark malts and barely any roastiness sensation.  Some dark fruits flavours (raisins with a little figs, dates and prunes) wrapped in smooth dark caramel (borderline toffee) and a subtle chocolate note.  A bit bready.  Moderately sweet without much hops presence and only a mild bitterness (voluntary unbalanced it seems).  Very smooth body, like a watery cream.

1356,"2005-08-07",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2013 First experience on tap at the brewpub, in 2005:

The Lure:Another great head collapses slowly onto atttractive roasted malts, anise-y sweetness and blackberry/blueberry fruitiness. 

The Festivities:The strong carbonation and fruity esters of the yeast make both of the beers I had here seem quite Belgian. Caramel and chocolate caress languorously and roasted malt bitterness and dryness. The balanced sequence of flavors also proffers various fruity suggestions, and a touch of star anise, all the while remaining a comfortable pint to quaff. 3.8/5
Transcendence:Watching a talented sculptor at work.

Second experience on tap, in 2008:
The chocolatey roastiness took the form of earthy tobacco and the balancing herbal hop finish made for a very well structured pint. The body is overall leaner than the usual Czech Tmavé. 3.6/5
