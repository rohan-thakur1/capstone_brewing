222,"2017-06-08",3.1,"12 oz single bottle from Total Wine & More - Laguna Hills. Clear, pale yellow appearance with a small, dissipating white head. Aroma of berries, herbs, spices, flowers, toasted grain and light citrus zest. Similar flavor, crisp, lightly bitter and lightly sweet. Light body with ample carbonation and a lingering finish. Overall, its kind of refreshing, but somewhat dominated by adjuncts. Not bad.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
222,"2017-04-27",3.5,"A nice refreshing beer. But this shouldn't be called a kolsch but a fruit beer. Very fruity taste and nose. But this isn't from grain it is from fruit extracts. So have to knock it for that.

222,"2016-05-29",3.3,"Pours a finger of head on a clear light straw body.
Aroma is a nice berry mixture.
Taste starts with a mild bitterness, then turns to a berry mixture and a little grassy. 
Texture is light.
Its a nice summer drink. The fruit was worked in nicely.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"
222,"2016-05-03",3.0,"Yellow pour. No head. Aroma is sweet and flora. The taste is like soap. Detergent. I don't know a better way to describe it. It's lite and all I taste is soap but it's not necessarily a bad thing.

222,"2016-01-31",3.2,"Floral hops on the nose as well as a bready backbone more in the flavor and hints of citrus and other things. Better than expected.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
222,"2015-11-21",3.7,"12oz bottle pours with a crystal clear pure gold body that supports a white head that leaves behind some spotty lacing. The mild aroma offers up a bit of sweet pilsner malts, a dash of hay and faint near vague hops that create a sliver of spicy to floral hoppiness. The taste delivers some spicy to mint like hops and then quickly picking up bitter floral and grassy hops. The hops seem pretty crisp with the aid of a clean slightly dry body. Between the hops and malts is a thin kind of malty candy like note that does not distract at all. Not bad. I was ready to hate yet another poorly crafted US made Kolsch. But this delivers a crisp moderately bitter hoppy experience. Fresh and via wooden cask this should resemble a darn nice Kolsch.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
222,"2015-07-13",4.7,"Fruity golden spiced malt aromas. Fishy gold color little to no head. Crazy flavor dry for how fruity it is smooth and amazing. Drink this beer, it is weird but awesome. And perfect on a good warm day.","truckee, California, USA","krumbum"
222,"2015-07-03",3.0,"Bottle, gold pour, white head, nose and taste are citrus, chill, pasadena new brewery","Santa Monica, California, USA","DedicatedToFun"
222,"2015-07-02",3.7,"On tap at Final Gravity. Pours golden with a thick white head and a nutty aroma. There is a strange flavor that includes citrus, raw coffee and bread. There is a dry, fairly bitter finish.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
222,"2015-06-06",3.4,"12 oz. bottle from Berkeley Bowl. It pours like a Kolsch. Clear pale yellow with a white head that shrinks quickly. The aroma is odd with a lot of raspberry up front with some light notes of bready malt. Im not getting any of the other ingredients. It smells basically like so many of those fruited wheat beers you get at brewpubs across America. The flavor has more hop character with a decent amount of grapefruit and solid floral bitterness. Raspberry notes persist, but dont totally overwhelm the beer due to the higher than usual hop presence. A bit too bitter in the finish. Overall, I think all the adjuncts are unnecessary in this beer as it seems to be competently brewed otherwise.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
222,"2015-01-12",3.9,"Bomber from CraftBeerKings. Pours pale gold with a foamy white head. Aroma of berry and citrus. Med body or nearly. This stuff has lots of flavor. Acai, raspbeery and citrus are definitely present. This isnt your standard tasteless ""Kolsch"". This is a very flavorful fruity and reasonably bitter (starting to get some tea there) ale. Highly recommended for session and hot days.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
222,"2015-01-10",4.8,"This beer is not your typical bland, light beer but is bursting with flavors of berry and citrus with a mild grapefruit finish. Its really refreshing and cant wait to drink it on a hot summer day as even when I had it is was cold out and I still wanted more. The taste is really great and not too berry like some out there to turn off the guys, at least not me. Pretty cool brewing with superfoods, too.","California, USA","jimmycaprese"
