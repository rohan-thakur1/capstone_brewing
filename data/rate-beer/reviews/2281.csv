2281,"2015-12-17",4.0,"""Bottled July 17, 2014."" 12 ounce bottle purchased at Holiday Wine Cellar about a month after the bottling date ($13.99). Pours a dark brown with bits of red highlight around the edge and a finger and a half of beige foam...impressive head for such a high ABV beer. AROMA of super-rich toffee, loads of sweet molasses and brown sugar, dark candied fruit, moderate bourbon notes, old wet oak, and a wee bit of chocolate toward the end. FLAVOR of dark chocolate, vanilla, really sweet candied fruit (a la holiday fruitcake), sweet-ish bourbon, and tons of sweet molasses. Gets sweeter as it warms up, eventually landing a little too close to cloying territory. Not necessarily a lot of booze in the flavor itself, but there is a whole lot of alcohol burn as it goes down the gullet...not necessarily a bad thing on this ""cold"" day in San Diego county. Avery was apparently going for the big booze element in this one. Interesting take on the quad style...would have liked more direct bourbon notes, but this still does quite well for a beer that was probably difficult to brew.

The aroma...serious dark fruits, Belgian yeasts, oak barrel, booze, some winter spices, and desert breads. The taste was like a desert cookie with a cordial liqueur. Booze, dark fruits, Belgian yeasts, spices, an almost hot apples sweetness. Thick, oily mouth. Booze finish with sweet dark fruits. Really just an AWESOME beer. .","Boca Raton, Florida, USA","Fritz123"
2281,"2014-09-08",4.3,"Bottle from Total Wine in Huntington Beach, CA. Pours very dark brown with a slight, transient tan head. Aroma is very dark fruit with a little heat. Inhale lifts the brain to a higher plane. Mostly to where plums are dried. Med body. Flavor is very treacle/prune with more than a bit of heat. Yummy!","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
2281,"2014-09-08",4.0,"Bottle shared by bhensonb. Pours dark brown with a pretty, but transient tan head and s very alcoholic dark fruit aroma. There is a hearty plum and dark malt flavor with a warm alcohol burn.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
2281,"2014-09-07",3.5,"Bottle @ home from the Avery release over the summer. $12. Pours a deep brown appearance with a brown head. Aroma has tons of brown sugar, light smoke, figs, plums, booze, cinnamon, and strong spices. Medium body. Heavy booze with a heavy burn on the finish. Lots of caramel, toffee, burnt sugar, vanilla, coconut, oak, and some dark fruits in the mouth. The finish burns. Pretty high sweetness. Kind of a fun flavor but itd be a good bottle to split with friends.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
2281,"2014-09-05",4.0,"Hazy brown with a cream head. Nose is alcohol, rich malts, sweet, light fruits, and yeast. Smooth palate, hint of alcohol, sweet malts, dough, florals, and a hot finish.","Dallas, Texas, USA","mar"
2281,"2014-09-03",3.4,"Brown pour, small tan head. Wow this is sweet and chewy. Too much actually. Boozy, caramel, brown sugar, honey, Belgian yeast...split this bottle with friends.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
2281,"2014-09-02",3.7,"Dark reddish brown color, some lace and retention which is good for the gravity of this. Aroma is complex with alcohol, barrel, vanilla, dark sugar, darker fruit (raisin/date), caramel, chocolate. Full bodied, sweet, sticky, alcohol present but its not overpowering. I wouldnt exactly categorize this with what youd imagine one of the traditional Belgian numberish (dubbel, tripel, quadrupel, etc) beers. ASA all the way, just like Firestone Walkers Stickee Monkee.","California, USA","ABUSEDGOAT"
2281,"2014-08-25",4.0,"Poured from a bottle it is a dark brown with a slight head the aroma is bourbon smell the taste is a lovely boozey flavor with hints of vanilla","mclean, Virginia, USA","Westchesterco"
2281,"2014-08-25",4.0,"From a 12 oz bottle courtesy of Ryan. Pours black with a tan head. Aroma of sweet caramel and dark cherries. Flavors of candi sugar and overripe pitted fruits. Intensely boozy finish with some lingering alcohol burn (not surprising given the high ABV).","Jackson Hole/McLean, Virginia, USA","Iphonephan"
2281,"2014-08-24",2.8,"Dark brown, smell boozy, very boozy, malt, caramel, the taste is so sweet you might go into a diabetic coma! This one should be released in the winter, not a summer beer, I am drinking this with the A/C on and once it hits the throat, I damn near had to get naked just to finish it. My advice is to pair this with a nice rare stake, something to combat that malty taste.","long beach, California, USA","Mrnoluv"
2281,"2014-08-23",4.4,"Bottle at home. Pours dark hazy brown with visible sediment. A thin tan head formed then disapeared. Smells of alcohol, banana, and flowers. Tastes sweet, with bourbon, oak  liquorice and alcohol, much like rum. Medium body, creamy mouthfeel and a long sweet finish. Amazing.","Washington, USA","joelfaber"
2281,"2014-08-18",4.0,"Bottle thanks to Nielsen ! Pours a deep mahogany color with two fingers of fizzy khaki foam. Nose is sweet and complex with rich caramel, dark fruit, warm bourbon and tootsie roll. Palate follows the nose with a chewy mouthfeel on the front end but the carbonation does a nice job on the finish to lighten everything up from being too sticky. Huge over the top flavors of gooey caramel, spicy tootsie rolls, vanilla, creme brulee, cola and cocoa dust.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
2281,"2014-08-16",4.4,"From a bottle. What an amazing treat! Pours a dark brown and makes a thin head of zillions if micro bubbles. Syrupy in appearance. Complex aroma of caramel, bourbon, raisins, malt, and alcohol. Tastes of caramel and bourbon. Drink slowly and enjoy this wonder, complex brew!

2281,"2014-08-15",3.6,"Quad seems more appropriate than a BSA since this base seems to be a quad (just one on steroids). HUGE boozy presence of bourbon, vanilla, oak, fussel alcohol. They do a pretty nice job with their huge beers, but this one is a little too far over the top. Plum like fruit and sweetness comes through as well as some candi and turbanado sugar, and even a hint of yeast...but all subtelty went out the window. Enjoyable, but definitely overdone. Would have been better at a more reasonable 13-14% abv :)""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
2281,"2014-08-10",4.1,"Bottle. Pours a murky brown with an off white head. Lovely bourbon nose (not overpowering) with layers of vanilla, raisins, dates, figs and some alcohol in the back. Full body with lots of caramel sweetness, dark fruits, vanilla, alcohol heat and bourbon. Hot finish but very smooth. Dangerously smooth at 19%. Plenty of residual sugar but just right for a beer this big. Will only improve with age as things round out.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","craftbeerdesign"
2281,"2014-08-10",4.2,"Bottle. Lucked into this one hard - and lucky I was. Absolutely stunning - buttery bourbon aroma, dried fruits, oak. Boozy, but doesn't taste like 19%. Simply gorgeous.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","ljthiessen"
2281,"2014-08-07",3.8,"12 oz bottle. Well, its extremely boozy as to be expected with a beer pushing 20%. Extremely heavy on the bourbon and overwhelming amount of oak on the nose. Actually, this isnt overwhelmingly sweet and has a huge oaky backbone with dark fruit and oak overtones. It isnt amazing, but as a small sipper its alright.","Lakewood, Colorado, USA","theothermatt"
2281,"2014-08-07",4.1,"Bottle. Pours dark brown with tan head. Aroma strong of coconut, raisin, vanilla, sweet, caramel. Taste is very coconut, definitely some heat but not nearly as much as I was expecting for such a strong brew, lots going on, sweet. Very good.","Colorado, USA","Danyel"
