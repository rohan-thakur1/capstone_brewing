Deep cloudy red. Sweet aroma - dark malts. Taste is a bit, erm, wow! Shocking, but very inviting. Hoppy and malty taste, a bit marmite, a bit burnt, sticky, hoppy, and rubber on the roof of my mouth. In some ways its a bit too much of a mix and slightly incoherent, but all the same its a stonking strong bock.
