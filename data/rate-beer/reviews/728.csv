728,"2016-09-20",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2016 Spicy, well balanced, grainy beer. Hides abv well, very smooth body. Not a particularly hoppy beer and a tad generic.","JAPAN","jonno"
728,"2016-09-19",3.7,"Keyaki fall 2016. Light caramel and peppery rye on the nose. Alcohol well-hidden with a light tropical feel on the palate, almost gummy bear-like. Peppery finish. Nice.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"

728,"2016-09-17",3.0,"Pours a golden-brown with a light taupe-tan head. Rye on the nose. Some citrus and pine. Mouthfeel is a little faint for the style. Flavors arent as aggressive as Id expected. The flavors approximate the nose.","Pensacola, Florida, USA","DocJitsu"
728,"2016-09-16",3.4,"Not a lot of rye or hops in the aroma, it is more malty. Absolutely stunning dark red color, a 5 all the way. The taste is surprisingly smoky, backed by malt sweetness and followed by a sharp rye bite. The mashup of flavors was a bit off to me and overall the taste was not as good as I was expecting. It does have a good oily palate which holds up to the strong taste very well. This was okay, but in no way should it be top 50 in its category.","Missouri, USA","coachd"
728,"2016-09-14",3.5,"Sample at KC Beerfest 2016. Comes a clear dark amber with a small beige head. Aroma of malt, caramel, and fruit. Taste is malt, caramel, fruit, and grain. Decent.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
728,"2016-09-11",4.0,"Bottle, opening week of football, and a toast to 9/11, a worthy choice. A handful in many ways ... first, the meaty visuals, rusty red and opaque, the tan head standing firm. The aroma is restrained, and this drinks with fairly restrained, yet still a butt-kicking style. Quietly full of a lot of angles, woodsy and bitter, yet fully founded. Like it.

728,"2016-09-04",3.6,"It pours deep reddish bronze with a tan head. The aroma has heavily toasted malt, pumpernickel bread and some earthy hops. It has a pretty full body with a moderate amount of carbonation. The taste has the bready malt of the aroma along with spicy rye, spicy hops, woodiness, pine and a heartiness to all of it. Pretty good.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
728,"2016-08-29",4.1,"Heavy deep clear amber with a thin ivory cap. Big delightful nose full of earthy amber caramalt notes and a nice bready spicy rye tone and a very slight orange rind bitterness. Big flavor thats predominately citrus rind-y, loads of bready spicy rye, and a bready, bitter, full and slightly boozy Amber malt body and finish. The citrusy rye hoppiness lasts till the finish as well. Quite nice and spicy and amberish.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

728,"2016-08-23",3.7,"on tap @ Hebron BrewHaus / Hebron KY --- Clear amber brown, beige head that slips to a full cover, lace cobwebs. Taste is caramel malt that moves smoothly through medium fizz to bracing rye bittering, but then back to semi-sweet in a drawn-out finish. A solid brew.","Lakeside Park, Kentucky, USA","rondphoto"

728,"2016-08-04",4.2,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass, best before 12/20/2016. Pours slightly hazy reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy light khaki head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, wood, pepper, pine, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, spicy rye, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/pine/earthy hops and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, lemon zest, orange peel, citrus rind, wood, pepper, pine, caramel, brown sugar, brown bread, spicy rye, toasted biscuit, light nuttiness, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/citrus rind/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, lemon/orange rind, wood, pepper, pine, caramel, spicy rye, toasted biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine/earthy hops and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero astringent hop flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, moderately sticky/resinous, and creamy/bready balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with a slight warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding imperial red IPA! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/pine/earthy hops and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

728,"2016-07-16",3.6,"Bomber. Earthy rye aroma with notes with biscuity malt, light pine and citrus hop hops notes.

Finishes dry with piney hop bitterness and some light citrus hops as well. Good rye ale.","","zoucrew102"
728,"2016-07-11",3.8,"651 ml. bottle. Pours a medium, tiny bubbled, well retained, ivory head, with Belgian curtain lacing, over a clear, dark copper (SRM 18) body.....nose is rye, light biscuit, mild cereal, light pine, fruit notes including raisin, malts slightly dominant......taste is soft with mild to moderate sweetness, rye and rye spice, mild toasted malts with light dried fruit notes, all from the malts, becoming moderately bitter with pine, citrus tones from the hops, with the bitterness lingering, no esters, malts slightly more apparent.....mouth feel, slightly sticky medium body, mild alcohol, carbonation makes a creamy mouthful. This is a moderately malt forward beer in both aromas and flavors, with the rye making a significant contribution. The hops are present enough to just balance the malts creating a very easy drinking enjoyable beer. BJCP 9/3/16/5/8","Salida, Colorado, USA","drjay44"
