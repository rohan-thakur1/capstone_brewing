651,"2014-09-22",4.0,"5.4%. Merveilleux mais simple nez de café fraîchement moulu. Beau col dense sur un liquide brun très foncé. En bouche cest étonnant. On dirait bien que je croque de véritables grains de café. La touche chocolatée arrive juste à point. Cest très réussi. Au palais, le liquide est de facture moyenne avec un pétillement fidèle à son conditionnement. Sa texture est, sans surprise, crémeuse. En finale, lamertume du grain est accompagné par du chocolat, des noix et du caramel. Trop facile à boire. La façon Funky.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
651,"2013-09-02",3.9,"On tap at the Buddha. Dark brown pour with a tan head. Huge espresso and dark roasted malt aromas. Dark roasted malts, bakers chocolate, and espresso notes dominate. Good body and mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"

651,"2011-08-24",4.4,"Appearance: dirty murky brown-black. Khaki head start off fluffy then fades to a collar surrounding a thin film.

Nose: espresso beans freshly roasted, crunchy, slightly singed and pure Arabica. Chocolate mingles within. Hint of burnt toast and burnt wood underneath and in the back.

Palate: fuller and creamier than its dry nose implied. Whisper of caramel meets roasted marshmallows, roasty and toasty along the sides. Espresso constantly weaves in and out, the fabric that holds it all together. Gentle melted chocolates encased in European truffles. Nondescript roast underneath. Sweetness up front and on top.

Final Thoughts: Awesome! Lovely! Fantabulous!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Mild acidic flavoured, overly espresso, mild toffee and yet without any real sweetness.

Aroma is big time coffee and a bit of roasted malt.  Flavor is coffee, roasted malt, and a bit of chocolate.  The coffee really lingers in the finish.  Medium body.  Very good coffee beer.  I believe this beer would do well against KBS in a blind tasting.  Thanks Eric.","BFE, Arizona, USA","cbkschubert"
651,"2010-10-21",4.3,"Brownish black with a foamy tan head.  Wow, the nose is all espresso, the most Ive ever gotten out of a beer.  There are hints of sweet cream and maybe some chocolate and dark fruit as well but that pure coffee is what sticks with you.  The body is medium to full, slightly under carbonated.  Bitter-sweet coffee flavor with bakers chocolate and cream.  It finishes as an espresso would, with mouth coating grainy bitterness.  Excellent beer.","USA","Slimbrundage"

651,"2010-10-19",4.4,"The first time I had this beer was at the Brewery Grand Opening, and honestly I couldnt get enough of it. Well, I couldnt, but my liver on the other hand could.
The base beer is the Piiti Porter which is The Buddhas standard Porter which is brewed with Lactose Sugar. So think of the Espresso Piiti as a Cafe con Leche, yep that is pretty much spot on.
I grew up in Tampa and was raised on Cuban Food, there honestly is nothing better in the morning than a nice piece of pressed Cuban Bread Buttered with a Cafe con Leche.
This beer took me back home. It is a perfect balance of the espresso coffee, sweet characteristics from the lactose milk, and still not overly heavy body wise.
I have been told this will be on tap often at the Buddha, which makes me happy!
Overall, another stand out beer from The Funky Buddha!","Florida, USA","dosbeerigos"
651,"2010-09-25",3.8,"Draft at the Buddha grand opening. This one is another real winner in the aroma department. Moderate coffee aroma mixed with some chocolate notes of the base beer make this a particularly tantilizing beer. The flavor is not as bold as you would expect and the mouthfeel just as with the base beer could use a little more in the way of grains. Perhaps some flaked oats? Its just a tad thin. Finishes with a terrific bold espresso roast that lingers for a while. A very solid beer that could become something truly amazing with a little tweaking.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
651,"2010-09-25",3.9,"On tap at the Buddha for the grand opening. Much like the Piiti Porter in appearance, this one takes on a new life in aroma with the onslaught of coffee you get from the aroma. I enjoy the aroma/flavors of coffee just as much as the next guy, but this might have been a bit too much. I applaud them for making this, because I really did enjoy it, but just tone down the coffee a little.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
