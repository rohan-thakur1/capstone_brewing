3323,"2017-04-26",3.8,"Donkerbruin met rode gloed, donker crèmekleurige foamy schuimkraag, troebel, iets koolzuur zichtbaar. 
Aroma: Brood/biscuit, geroosterde mout, karamel, toffee, donker fruit, bessen en aards hoppig.
Smaak: Zoet in begin, daarna chocolade en geroosterde hinten. Iets zoutig met drop en zoethout. Fruitige tonen vanuit de hops komen tussen de geroosterde mouten door met grassige en pijnboom hinten.  Donker fruit, rozijnen, pruimen. Door de mix van roast en tropische hops een mooi fruitige hint met een prima bitter. Aan de zoete kant met wat alcohol warmte. 
Lekker bier maar gaat voor mijn gevoel qua stijl alle kanten op.
