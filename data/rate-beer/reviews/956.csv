956,"2017-05-27",3.5,"Big! Huge!! Enormous!!! 

Gently rolling the beer into the glass this hazy dark amber liquid developed a cocky three finger off white head. The lacing lovingly caressed the glass as the lingering head relaxed very slowly and downsized to a long lasting sudsy layer. 

The aromas are huge filling the room then flowing into the back room and kitchen the air heavy with its sweet and fruity fragrance - apple, banana, Asti Spumante and a little yeast to mention a few. 

In the mouth it's lush and luxurious with a laid-back effervescence that percolates around the mouth. 

The flavour is surprisingly and sublimely dry. Not overly bitter but satisfyingly light and crisp balanced by the background fruitiness like a mellow merlot. I say it's surprising because from the aromas I expected the sweeter aspects to dominate. My one complaint is the brevity of the flavour hit needing longer legs to carry the character to an indulgent conclusion.","Nottinghamshire, ENGLAND","Onesimus"

956,"2017-04-21",4.5,"Appearance - nice, reddish-brown amber color. Almost copper. Beautiful carbonation that almost reminds me of a good sparkling wine. Very inviting.

Aroma - funky farmhouse smell upfront of hay and horse stables. Citrussy, almost white wine-y. Very surprising when you first serve it, but what a welcome surprise.

Taste - citrussy, champagne-y funkiness leaning towards green apples combined with hay and a hint of horse stable. Grassy, floral hoppiness. A really crisp and green taste. With a beautiful hoppy bitterness in the after taste that makes you go yep, its still beer, though. It is so exquisitely well-balanced, something which I miss in most other sours Ive tried. Beautiful. Absolutely beautiful.

Palate - nothing of note. Not watery. Not syrup-y. A nice sparkly carbonation like those in sparkling wines. Really well done.

Overall - this is still my favorite beer. It is the beer that got me interested in craft beer. Upon first serve it simply smacks you in the face with its uniqueness, without being over-the-top. It is so amazingly well balanced in its farmhouse characteristics and its beer-y/hoppiness, and I havent really found any other beer that I have gotten so utterly smitten about. It reminds me of my childhood hometown: it is simply the countryside in a glass. If Beethovens Pastorale symphony were a beer. This would be it.","","teddybearontap"

Medium amber in color, with orangish tint, hazy and medium low clarity. Bright spicy, fruity aroma with Brett barnyard funkiness in the background. Flavor is just as complex: yeasty spice and fruit with wet hay earthiness. Medium full body with lively carbonation and a refreshing slightly dry finish. Overall this beer is absolutely great but very different from what is expected of a Trappist ale. The addition of Brett produces an enticing funky and sour aroma and flavor that pairs well with the more common Belgian spicy, fruity yeast.

956,"2017-02-23",5.0,"With 6.9% alc. Pours with a nice and airy foam that can be made to look very appealing. The foam also stays long. Color is of mead, very nice color. Aroma is delicious having fruits (mango, plum, black grapes) and some yeast, almost smells like fruit juice. Palate is strongly, but finely carbonated and is slightly yeasty and dry. Taste is tea-like having a ""herbal"" overall feeling to it (similar to those herbal pouches sold for refreshing odours) and also tastes like a hippie/vegan food store smells. Additionally taste has some salt licorice. Overall the beer has a slightly strange/surprising taste, but not bad by any means. Theres a slight bitterness from the hops. This tastes like a very good quality ale and seems to be in its own category (since I have never tasted something quite similar tasting beer). Very refreshing as well.","Jyväskylä, FINLAND","mviljamaa"

First I had a little accident when I opened the bottle, it looks as if I had just opened champagne despite not having shacken it too much. The abv is definitely more than 6.2%, you can sense it in the smell and also the taste. Other aromas contain some pinapple, banana, and caramel. Not too strong but smells ok, baybe a bit too boozy. Then, even though it should have lost most of the gas, it was waaaay too carbonated, not very pleasant. The finish was kind of weak too, at least the texture was alright. Bonus points for its relatively low price and accessibility, but I didnt enjoy it too much. Will try to re-rate soon.","Barcelona, SPAIN","michael_bb"

Belle couleur dorée/orangée presque transparente avec une très grosse mousse ivoire dense à montée centrale. Au nez, on sent une bière avec un caractère bien trempé ! Des agrumes (citron vert, mandarine en tête), des aromates (coriandre, basilic, thym, romarin, origan, estragon...), de la fleur (illet, tulipe, bouton de rose, pissenlit, jacinthe...) et du foin, des céréales légèrement torréfiées assez lointaines... La carbonatation est soutenue, la texture sèche au démarrage et plus souple sur la fin, lamertume étant sous contrôle tout au long de la dégustation. Lalcool est au top (6.2%), il soutient les arômes et les saveurs sans les entacher. Le final est sur la sécheresse des houblons, toujours avec ce côté floral très prononcé qui est la qualité première de cette bière (à mon sens). La levure est bien perceptible, longue, légère, dans larrondi... La longueur est intéressante, reste une sécheresse sur du velours pendant de longues secondes... On trouvera aussi des parfums marins avec un côté iodé et salin très surprenant. Très honnêtement, lOrval na jamais été ma bière préférée et de loin, mais elle a pour elle une histoire et loriginalité de sa recette ainsi que de sa bouteille reconnaissable entre mille.

956,"2016-11-25",5.0,"La tradition brassicole à labbaye de Notre Dame dOrval est relativement jeune, car ce nest quen 1931 que la brasserie a été créée pour financer la reconstruction de labbaye. Est-ce par inspiration divine, que le maître brasseur Pappenheimer crée lOrval ? On pourrait le croire, tant les spécificités liées à sa recette et la maîtrise brassicole liée à sa réalisation en font une bière de référence. En verre, lOrval est dun beau cuivré, limpide et son effervescence marquée lui confère une mousse blanc-cassée, majestueuse, imposante saffaissant par « cratères ». Le nez est très développé. Personnellement, il me fait penser à celui dun cidre fermier, où à la ferme elle-même avec un côté terroir développé. La dégustation est dune richesse infinie. Chaque gorgée vous fera découvrir un pan de la bière, et ce nest quen fin de dégustation quil est possible dapercevoir toutes les subtilités de celle-ci. Lattaque marque dentrée lamertume, mais liée à la douceur de la poire et de la pomme. La deuxième bouche permet de découvrir une amertume intense, fraîche et herbacée (utilisation dun houblonnage à cru). Larrière bouche est quant à elle plus douce, sur des notes de caramel et de fruits rouges. Léquilibre est splendide car tellement tenu. Lalliance entre lamertume et le sucré, soutenu par une pointe dacidité (et jai bien dit une pointe!) est remarquable. Et une légère âpreté vient donner du caractère à la bière, mais sans trop assécher le palais cependant. Le final est très long et laisse sur le final découvrir une amertume évolutive, plus « grasse » sur des arômes dorange. Vous êtes devant un tableau de grand maître, où à chaque coup dil vous percevez un détail supplémentaire et où en vous déplaçant, votre perspective vous fait redécouvrir luvre. Comment alors noter une référence ? Je nen sais rien, nous sommes dans lincomparable. Seul le 5 me paraît simposer.","FRANCE","jybi"

Had this plenty of times over the years but was finally coerced into typing up a rating. These bottles were bottled April 27, 2016. At 5 months old this is the youngest we can get Orval in the US and even though its between that hoppy fresh flavor and that nicely aged (12-18 months) mildly funky stage its still a damn good beer. 
As always its highly carbed, hazy, bitter, and delicious. Takes a while for the head to die down. As mentioned before, this has not yet developed the characteristic funk that it gets after a year in the bottle. Mind you thats under proper aging conditions. Aging in your closet does not count.","Do Not Resuscitate, California, USA","t0rin0"

Si está cerca del embotellado suele ser más lupulada, tanto en aroma como en sabor, con menos restos en la botella y con un carácter más acido y muy seco, que recuerda al champán o la sidra. Si ha pasado más tiempo, esa acidez se va matizando y convirtiéndose en dulzor y los restos en el interior de la botella son más notables. Según un experto en Orval, cuando han pasado dos años de la fecha de caducidad es cuando mejor está.

A combination of hop and grape skins. The flavor is interesting. There is a tartness and a profound hoppiness, but its strange. There is a light malt and that same vinousness.

Flush the typical Orval glass with hot water 60-80 degrees celcius to make sure all germs and dust is removed. Secondary, make sure that all the carbonate is flushed with water. Cool the glass afterwoods with cold water to prevent it from braking a part.

1 / Lapparence :
- Mousse : Fine, ""solide"", se creusant et laissant un relief montagnard inspirant, dun blanc cassé assez terne, bien persistante, collant amoureusement au verre.
- Couleur : Ambrée orangée presque rougeâtre, assez trouble
- Bulles : Petites, quelques.Effervescence petite à moyenne quand on prend le soin de bien laérer au service, verre TEKU 33cL.

2 / Lodeur :
Houblon vous dîtes ? je perçois dabord les levures sauvageonnes, cube de levure boulangère bien marquée, définie à la perfection.Notes de pomme, cidre, calvados par le côté vraiment sec et franc de la pomme ""transformée"", cidre extra brut aussi peut-être, cidre artisanale paysan qui titre 6-7 °
Quelque chose de pamplemousse, agrume sec et amère.
Notes épicées, parfum dambre, qui arrondissent le nez plutôt de prime abord sec et fruité.

3 / Le goût :
Fluide, franche, bien sec et amer mais pas tant astringent, donc délice.
Le houblon prédomine avec des notes vertes et fraîches.
Une certaine fraicheur herbeuse mais bien emmitouflée dans ses notes épicées et levurées rondes bien que tranchantes et marquées.Vous connaissez le cube de levure boulanger ? cest exactement ça, et on retrouve la même chose cher la XX de de Struise.
4 / Leffet en bouche :
Arômes assez secs mais corps sachant tempérer leurs ardeurs et ce de façon vraiment délicate et subtile : équilibre de lensemble, équilibre discret qui cache son jeu.Le chemin cest sec, moelleux, sec.Mais pas astringent donc jamais trop sec.
Grosse persistance, la grogée avalée continue à stimuler pailles et capteurs de flaveurs nasales.

5 / Facilité à boire :
Grosse tuerie, pardon lexpression est simple mais cest vrai.elle est unique, un peu moins depuis la XX de de struise (qui est largement moins bien maîtrisée mais intéressante).

Le côté pomme allié à ses levures belliqueuses ""boulangères"" cest inédit et le tout enrobé dun corps qui dit pas son nom mais fais le job quand son bras droit ""taux dalcool"" vous appuie sur la nuque et vous tapote le front vers la fin du verre.","FRANCE","BobyFischer"

956,"2016-02-21",3.9,"What I like about this beer the very strong and powerful hoppy side. Its not a beer centered on the yeast taste or on the malt taste, the hop is the most important part of the aromas and flavours of this beer in my opinion. Its quite bitter, not a bad bitterness, the kind that gives a good aftertaste added to it a small sweetness. The beer looks good, its foam is extra creamy and long lasting, I rarely get to have such lovely foam in a beer. Nice and long aftertaste, kind of sweet. The first time I tasted it I didnt really like it.... today is different, I just love it.","FRANCE","Tenval"

Aroma is actually more medicinal/soapy than expected which Im guessing is a flaw in the bar not the beer. Taste just isnt as amazing as it was in Belgium in its freshest form. More sour and tart than it should be but the good Belgian qualities are somewhere in there. Born in date is Dec 2015 so Im not attributing the disappointment to the freshness. Maybe it needs to age? Some sweetness present. Warms up to create a better taste but still not quite there.

Orval  bottled 03.06.15  (3 1/2 months old)

Appearance: Amber coloured beer, one finger, fluffy, cloud-like white head - very tightly packed. Leaves nice lacing on glass which then slowly slips away to rejoin the beer in the glass. Very nice looking beer, especially when served in the correct Orval glass (that was designed by the Abbeys Architect, no less). 
As Im coming to the end of the glass, the head is still made up of the tinniest bubbles you can imagine. Bubbles so small that you can barely see them, they are ever so tightly packed. As I swirl the last, probably 15ml of beer in the glass it remains stuck together almost like a fried egg in a frying pan - a sure sign of a quality product.

Aroma: Strong aroma of apples and pears with dry white wine and other acidic sour fruits. The smell is really nice, cant pull my nose away from the glass. Getting a hint of banana along side the apples and pears as its warming up. 

Taste: Hoppy then sour then hops coming on strong again in the finish. A very refreshing beer. This beer is still fairly cold as I poured it straight from the fridge. Its very unique taste wise and seems to be different every time I try it - which is fairly often. Always thoroughly enjoyable. Love the way the hops are fighting with the sour flavours of the brett yeast all the way from start to finish.

Mouth feel: Dry, tart and bittering (which doesnt sound pleasant but absolutely is where this beer is concerned).

Overall: An absolute all-time favourite. If I could only drink one beer for the rest of my life (heaven forbid!), then this might quite possibly be the one, purely because it never fails to surprise and is always familiar yet somehow different. 10/10, no questions asked!
_____________________________________  bottled 06.08.14  (14 Months Old)

Appearance: I was really surprised by how much the appearance has changed over the 3.5 month old Orval. It has lost a lot of its bright amber colour and is now much paler. Head is not is not fluffy as it was in the younger brew and, although it is covering the surface of the beer completely, the beer can seen through the head when looking from above.

Aroma: The aroma has become stronger, punchier and more acidic. The apple and pears are still present.

Taste: The hop flavour has dropped off a lot but is still dectectable in the finish. The sourness from the brett is now dominating from the start.

Mouth feel: Dry and slightly tart, as with the younger brew.

Overall: While I am thoroughly enjoying this beer, I have to say I preferred the younger brew but Im not sure if thats due to me being extremely tired while reviewing this slightly older Orval.

Aromas of big lemon, pineapple, cherry, pear, apple, white grape, hay, straw, pepper, grass, toasted biscuit, musty funk, light leather, and herbal/yeast earthiness.

Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness after the finish from the carbonation. High carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, fairly creamy/bready, and lightly prickly mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible Belgian Trappist ale. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/spicy yeast, earthy hops, and moderate bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV.

Fabulous dense white head that stays in place for the whole time, on top of a cloudy dark amber liquid. As for the flavours, right away a somewhat bitter woody taste: oak and leather, very herbal and developing in mouth to grapefruit. The taste is very dry on palate, which, together with the woody flavours, gives it an almost whisky-like character. Creamy-slick texture and medium carbonation with a clean, bitter finish. Medium to full, if not full, body. A marvellous beer to enjoy slowly due to the greatness -in every sense-  of the flavours and aromas.

Aroma of a sour, with green apple, stone fruit and funk. If chilled, let it warm closer to room temperature to open up.

Some pear notes find there way through, and plentiful carbonation provides a satisfying mouth feel and attractively dry finish.

Amber orange with greenish shades. Incredibly thick ivory head.
After ageing for more than a year, the secondary aromas (still present, such as fermenting bread, yeast, yogurt, cider) yield way to fragrant white flowers.
Noticeably sour, but never to the point of being unbalanced. Dry, bitterish, and long-lasting. The after-taste is reminiscent of bitter herbs. So different and so marvelous.

When aged more than 10 years, as I had the privilege of tasting in Kulminator, Antwerp, the sheer acidity and secondary aromas yield to a perfect balance of almost all flavours except sweet and a predominant aroma of wild red berries and roses. Amazing.","Madrid, SPAIN","huineman"

In bocca si spalanca una girandola di sensazioni che vanno dal vinoso alla frutta sotto spirito, passando per note lievemente tostate ad acide.

Not my favorite of this style, with a lower ABV and a less complicated taste profile, it is still a fine example of brewing as an art.

El aroma y la finura del gusto de la cerveza de Orval tienen más a los lúpulos y a las levaduras que a las maltas.A esta cerveza se le echa bastante lúpulo y esto en dos momentos distintos de su producción: la gran cantidad de lúpulos finos utilizados en sala de macerado le confiere un grado de amargura muy elevado al mismo tiempo que una larga conservación.

956,"2015-01-04",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2017 Having been familiar with this trappist for so many years, I noticed I hadnt put it on this site yet, so its about time for a rating. I dug up a ten months old bottle from the cellar and pour it into a wine glass - the original glass, belonging to Belgiums most iconic glassware (no less so than the drop-shaped bottle), is perfectly fit for enjoying this in a pub or an outdoors café, but its shape seems too wide to capture enough of the aroma in an actual tasting session. Very thick, dense and moussy, crackling, yellowish white head over a deep orangey amber beer with strong fizz, clear at first but hazy with deposit - which, by the way, is often served separately in a small liquor glass as it contains the wild yeast which makes this brew so beloved among beer afficionados. Spritzy, appetizing aroma of great complexity: crabapple, sour berries, lemon zest, sourdough, leather, cava, wet hay, dry white wine, unripe plums, biscuit, sorrel, raw rhubarb, grapefruit, red wine vinegar, freshly cut grass, bitter honey, soap and - unexpectedly - a very remote hint of ammonia, which in this case does not even disturb too much. Very dry and utterly crisp taste with finely tingling, even further drying carbonation, almost a brut taste, sour and unripe fruits in high quantities, refreshing lemony acidity and even a slight hint of saltiness, nutty malt background, a tad toasted and only very faintly sweetish, becoming ever more yeasty and hoppy towards the end; the finish has residual nutty maltiness, the funky, powdery, dryly sherryish, sourish and leathery effect of Brettanomyces and a great, long lasting deal of leafy, earthy and peppery hop bitterness. You are left with a mouth and throat completely dried - but in a rewarding, appetizing, pleasant way which makes you long for more. This is a category by itself: it originated in the thirties as something completely different from what was (and still is) custom among trappist breweries and became not only one of the greatest classics on the Belgian beer map, but in beer culture in general. It has had a dedicated following for many a decade and though perhaps something of an acquired taste, those who fall in love with it, remain strikingly faithful to it. A beer this famous and old has of course undergone many changes, with quality discussions among its followers resulting from that. My personal impression is that the hoppiness, which originally made this ale famous (before the advent of American style IPAs, this was the hoppiest beer of the country), had declined a bit some two years ago along with the wild Brett character, but that since last year, both of these features have returned in full glory (which may, or may not, have to do with the arrival of a new - female - brewmaster). Finally, it is a well-known fact that Brettanomyces can digest bigger sugars than Saccharomyces but takes more time to do so, which makes this an ideal beer for cellaring; lots of pubs and even beer shops sell Orval at 2+ years of age nowadays and consider the matured version a different beer compared with a young bottle. I cannot but agree with this: thought the crisp hops will fade after a few years, the Brett does not cease to do its work, resulting in a beer less bitter but much more dry and funky. Waste products of the Brett fermentation include compounds that render the beer an aroma of exotic fruits after a couple of years and I vividly recall a 4-year old sample to be one of the most exciting Belgian beers I ever tasted. A 2-year old sample was somewhere in between: an almost citrussy, delicate, fresh cucumber- and passion fruit-like sourishness rose up from the glass, as well as a delicate rose petal perfume (a typical Brett effect after a certain amount of time), paired with a still vivid floral hoppiness; the sweet banana touch of the 4-year old was already in the making and the body had lost none of its effervescence and crispness.  The taste too stunningly balanced all these features, a real treat and a taste profile of marvellous complexity.  Patience and perseverance are key in the appreciation of this great beer - not in the least because it has become a lot harder to find in the past years as well. Though opinions differ concerning the amount of ageing it needs (for me personally, anything between 2 and 5 years gives the best results), it is a world classic in its youth, in its middle age and in its aftermath, everyone into beer should taste this both young and old to decide for themselves which age they prefer.  I take the more mature vintages into account for this rating - and frankly, I do not understand why this does not score higher...  As for me: I can drink this all night and have been known to do so, I just never get tired of it.  World class - and in the modern beer world dominated by creativity and more extreme flavours, I have the impression that this is among those very few old Belgian classics that keep standing strong, even among young beer geeks who are practically born in the international IPA and imperial stout tendencies of our age.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

La naso le sue note molto fruttate vengono subito fuori: troviamo un sentore di vinaccia, quasi di grappa barricata, e sotto sotto anche qualche nota di mela verde. Al palato ritroviamo però una carbonazione molto spinta, quasi al limite, quasi ad allappare il palato. Il corpo è tendente al leggero, con lievi note di pane. Lamaro finale è molto morbido e si accompagna ancora a note fruttate (bacca rossa). Il sorso è molto rotondo con una buona complessità totale.","Vallata, SUD ITALIA, ITALY","Diabobale"

Version ""vieille"" (plus dun an et demi après son acquisition à labbaye) : parfum très volatile dalcool, embaume les fruits jaunes, gourmande; très belle mousse abondante et vive, ressemblant à de la crème fouettée ou du blanc doeuf en neige; couleur ambre doré.

Version ""jeune"" (quelques mois de mise en bouteille) : corps couleur ambrée claire, trouble, fines bulles, surmonté dune mousse blanc cassé fine, aérienne mais consistante (comme des blancs en neige), qui chante, présente tout au long de la dégustation. Aromes dorange douce, levure, coriandre, clou de girofle, pâte à biroche crue, herbe coupée, noix fraîche, et houblon bien sûr. On retrouve tout cela dans les saveurs à quoi sajoute la muscade et une légère acidité; lamertume est prononcée sans être agressive; elle apporte une grande longueur; elle est très expressive avec un met très ton sur ton comme un croque-monsieur au fromage dOrval (vieux dans le cas de cette dégustation); un peu de salinité sur la fin; la carbo est importante sans être excessive.

956,"2014-10-25",3.9,"Bottle from Stockmann in Tallinn ( 4,45). My first Orval - not sure why Ive restrained myself from trying it before... Bottled 7 months ago on 31.03.2014; BB 31.03.2019. Pours... all foam! Massive, white with a creamy hue, frothy, thick, leaving very dense lacing... and beneath that a liquid starts to show thats hazy dark orange amber. Nose is bubblegum, cinnamon biscuits and earthy hops, pickled autumn fruits, cidery acidity. If I let it sit still for a few minutes, the acidity will burn my nostrils. Taste is surprisingly bitter with lemon zest and earthy notes most apparent, also moderately sour, and malty with low sweetness, yet caramelly, and has that British cinnamon biscuit note to it. It thickens as it warms, acquiring more dense, autumny flavours including plums or dark cherries. Finish is sharp bitterness somewhere way back in the throat, whereas in the mouth its more grainy and malty with a white wine acidic character. Light to medium, almost watery body (though thickening as it warms) is accompanied by flat carbonation and a cidery, slightly grainy dry palate. 

Im not being original by saying this is an exeptional brew - probably the most complex beer Ive tasted yet - even if I cannot consider myself a fan of some of its aspects considering the palate, especially the finish. Will definitely try more and less fresh versions to give it a better verdict.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Kauge"

Orange, and just hazy enough that when you look into the glass you see the beer and not your cat, cast in orange, on the other side of it. The head is pillowy, collapsing seductively and structurally but barely reducing at all. The aroma and the flavour are not overtly extreme or aggressive, but have a combination of all the good things about beer, in the right amounts, to amount to the perfect beer-drinking experience. It would feel wrong to score this in any way other than perfectly. This is not the first time I have had this, each time I have wanted to remove myself from the grasp of this beer, but found myself only wound tighter into its grip (sounding like an alcoholic now).

I would like to be at a party, in the summer, outdoors, where everyone is dressed nicely but casually, with many beautiful women. We are all talking about the rivers of Slovenia, photography books, travel stories, and everyone is emptying chilled bottles of Orval into large glasses. One after the other. There is a wood fired oven where pissaladière comes out (im coming back to reality now, because thats what Im eating).

Nutty body which turned fruity and actually almost citrusy and then had a brief finish of hops. Nice mouthfeel. Went down smoothly and setup the palate for another swig almost immediately.

956,"2014-08-25",3.5,"Reviewed from notes. 
This was poured into a chalice. 
The appearance was a nice hazy golden orange to light brown color with tints of yellow roaming around the sides of the glass. Theres a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute leaving some light lacing here and there. 
The smell had a nice blend of sweet citrus to spices of cinnamon, ginger, allspice and clove.
The taste was spicy sweet through the previously mentioned flavors. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. The carbonation was somewhat sharp but not overbearing. Nice spiciness rolled over my tongue. 
Overall, I say this was a pretty good Belgian pale ale worthy of having again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

When it settles, it leaves a hazy amber liquid with medium to high carbonation, and still a large, irregular head with big bubbles. Aroma is intense, hoppy, slightly yeasty and fruity. Once past the head, it tends towards more spices, still with plenty of hops and some fruits, and a bit of sweetness too, although it is definitely on the dry side. There is a little more in the aroma that I cant identify, some sort of apple pie with cinnamon on it, but not exactly. Palate is fizzy, otherwise quite medium. Long bitter finish that turns sweet after some time.

I have never seen so much head in a beer before, despite pouring it carefully I got only head first. Probably due to a bad sample or batch, who knows?

Previous formulations of this rating:
Alright, I have to go for the 5 here. I have decided I should use the full scale if the experience is worth it. If I had to pick one beer to drink for the rest of my life, itd be Orval. Its always a surprise, always reliable and just amazing. Its got hops, its got bretts, its got a perfect soft foamy mouthfeel - ""moussierend"" as one would say in German. And its always awesome, and so unique. 

Nice hazy orange color. Some hoppy citrus fruits in the nose. Dry and fruity on the palate, proper bitterness, with a slightly sour finish. I usually go for the Quadrupels when drinking Trappist beers, but this is better for the summer, surprising and great!After having had this more often:This is a timeless classic.

956,"2014-05-29",4.0,"Very highly carbonated with a tall frothy head. Aroma is pretty light, all yeast. The flavor is very dry with some geuze and champagne character. The hops seem to just make it even more dry. It has some of the pepper and spice that you would find in a golden ale or saison. An interesting beer that combines a few different Belgian styles, while remaining very unique. Seems strong for the ABV. A tiny hint of lemon for tartness. Classic beer, cant wait to cellar a few bottles.","Newington, Connecticut, USA","fishonmyplane"

Taste has minor fruit notes and a bit more of that funk. Honestly, it's a bit understated. It's weird to 'review' such a famous beer.

It looks like youre in for a big treaty when the murky dark orangey ochre with its frothy peak calls you forth.

I have heard about herds of Chinese buying this beer as much as they can. And they can I presume. Because what else do you need in a new world order. In my favourite café, they somtimes whine and argue the Orval is not on stock, and that is a little, little bit bad.
Because this is a beer you dont want to miss. It is one of my favourite ones, almost a champagne like beer, and if you keep it longer it will get better with time. Most of the Orval are served within one to twelve months after the production date, well here in Holland. But I think after the Chinese had a thought about it, that might be just six months maximal.
I wonder what the beer will cost in China, because here the prices are going up as well. For a Belgium Ale (Orval) I have to pay way more then 2 Euro 30 I think. Just crazy, and in the cafe more than 5 Euro and 70 cents something!!! I am in Belgium almost every week, and I know the production of Rochefort, Westfleteren and Orval is not that much aside, and I pay reasonable prices there. I know a café that only serves Orval from the tap, and the entire cafe smells because of that. But I leave that cafe with a Burgundy thought and my wallet still filled with my hard earned money!
About the beer; to the Chinese, thank you for unburgundy me! For the brewers, I still can get a hold of your beer, and I love it! In my top three togheter with Rochefort and a brewery the Chinese dont want to know about.

Appearance: a cloudy cidery color, about a 27 on the SRM is my guess with a gorgeous half inch white head, yummy AND NOW!!!!!
taste: A medium bitter beer, slightly salty with a good earthy tone. Im trying to find the sweet fruity flavors that Ive came to enjoy in most Belgian trappist ale, but I think its just to young. Im noting to look into tannic with beer? It is still very delightful though.
Ugami: Well there is that sweet apple like taste that lights up your mouth and makes the beer slightly sour. perfect finish and what I was looking for in the taste, well done!!!!
Just took my first overall sit back drink, wow!!!! well put together beer.... bitter at the beginning, but over the top and then the sour apple finish that lingers slightly in your mouth. Nice","","navajojoe"

A - has a beautiful hazy copper colour that passes medium light and a big fluffy head that lasts forever! there is tonnes of lacing on the glass by the time im finished with it. great looking beer overall.

S - for me, this is the strong point of the beer. i am absolutely drawn in by the smell on this one. its hard to even put my finger on what im smelling because its all seems to mix so well together into its own smell. has a nice citrusy and floral hint off the top but its prime character is almost that of fresh wood. it smells sweet and savoury at the same time. definitely pineapple and fresh bread coming through. maybe some banana, cloves or coriander as well? all my favourites ;)

T -the taste leaves a bit to be desired after the incredible smell off the top, and also for a beer thats rated so highly in the belgian pale ale category. with that being said i did enjoy the taste of this beer as it seemed to have a good balance of hops and malt and didnt have any overpowering alcohol taste like ive found from a few other belgian pale ales. it is definitely a unique beer.

M - i was dissapointed with the amount of carbonation in this beer. i feel like if they toned that down slightly the flavours would come out a lot more (maybe why the head was so long lasting). however, the carbonation did make me burp quite a bit :p bringing out some flavours i may have missed (hopefully not yesterdays lunch) at the same time it goes down pretty easy once the carbonation dies down a bit

O - well i finally got to try the trappist beer ive been waiting so long for. i feel like the anticipation of trying it may have ruined it a little for me, but i still enjoyed the beer a lot. i picked up a few bottles so ill be getting a couple more tries at this one. not my favourite trappist, but hey, its better than a lot of whats available in my area so i wont complain. a trip to the monastery in belgium might help me enjoy this one a little more ;) great beer!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","randallpink"

Look: Pours with big bubbly, billowy off-white foam, very sparkly (you can hear it). Slow retention, thick layer stays on top for the whole ride. Leaves some lacing. Cloudy dirty orange/brown with huge amounts of carbonation. A few yeast float around. Why not. 


Smell: It fills the room. Dried dark fruit - raisins, figs, slightly brandy-ish. Lots of funk, brett notes. Spice, cloves and sour. Fattening and complex.


Taste: Complex. Heavy farmhouse brett funk, leather but not off-putting. Spicy. Caramel sweetness, but hard to appreciate with all that excessive carbonation. Some metallic aftertaste, but not too much - comes and goes. Also moderate sour and hop bitterness in the aftertaste. Complex and interesting as fuck - not sure its my cup of tea - but it does get better every sip. 


Mouthfeel: Lots of crisp, aggressive carbonation - kinda hinders the overall taste. Medium body, leaves some coating.


Overall: A tough one. I do like the progressive complexity, the not too in-your-face brett character with sour notes, but the carbonation is silly and gets in the way. Still a massive beer, definitely a must try - some old-school shit.","SLOVENIA","tmzl"

Tengo entendido que la fermentación espontánea que se produce en la botella, acaba transformando los azúcares aportando fuerza y consistencia a su espuma.

Su aroma es uno de los puntos fuertes de esta compleja cerveza, puesto que desde el primer instante, nos deleita con unos tonos florales, especiados y cítricos acompañando a unas notas lupulizadas en perfecta armonía.
Una amplia gama que nos maravilla e invita a repetir el proceso para captar hasta el mas mínimo detalle ofrecido.

El sabor de esta cerveza es el ""punto de inflexión"" donde suelen ocurrir por norma dos opciones muy simples: o encanta y fascina esta espumosa o no gusta nada en lo absoluto.
Puedo realizar esta afirmación puesto que he vivido dicha situación en primera persona en muchas ocasiones y siempre ha sido el mismo resultado, que ya como dije anteriormente, se trata de una cerveza muy muy compleja.
En lo que a servidor respecta, me incluyo en el grupo a quienes les encanta y fascina.

Cuando saboreamos esta trapense, nos inunda el paladar con unas notas oscilantes intensas entre dulce y amargo recordando a cítricos, lúpulo, especias, malta y un fondo muy sutil acaramelado (seguramente por el azúcar empleado en su elaboración).
Deja en boca un regusto seco y amargo dando paso al tono afrutado y por último dejando un tono dulce pasando de puntillas.

Tasty. Interesting how this has grown on me. Now that Im much more into Brett beers than two years ago, I like this much better. Perfectly balanced, complex Brett ale example, that also drinks pretty easy.

Well, I dont know how to take this. Surely a unique, complex, well balanced and also refreshing brew, but just not my style.

Bottled October 2012, drank 29JUL13

Standard lightly hazed honey colored ale with a huge foam cap that falls to a central dome in about ten minutes. The bubbles almost look like a perfectly toasted marshmallow. Smells of grain, hay, grass, pineapple, pear, and a little clay yeast. Flavor is bitter with a solid biscuity malt profile, some nice corn character and a hint of english cucumber muddled in there someplace. Medium on thin with nearly flat carbonation at this point and a refreshing finish. Im torn on this beer, as I move toward more delicate beers with nuance and what I currently consider maturity in the beer - I feel like this is a good beer and understand how its considered world class. I cannot see, however, how this manages to be a approachable beer for me, but leaves me simply empty at the end. I dont long for more, I dont take a sip and immediately want another. For these reasons I continue to steer clear of this one. 

From notes verbatim on 10/28/10
A: Pale apricot ale with massive head that just keeps growing. Maybe overly carbonated? Dull clarity.
S: Lots of bretty funk. Sharp, strong, herbal. Im fairly neutral to this one.
T: This beer is soooo bitter to me. I cant tell why. I may need to revisit this beer to make sure Im not having an off night.
M: Very carbonated. Medium body ale.

956,"2013-10-07",3.9,"33cl bottle into tulip.

Lille, France

Appearance: cloudy orange/brown liquid with ample head. Okay retention. Some lacing on glass

Aroma: fairly fragrant: floral hops, cellar/yeasty, citrus.

Taste: dry and bitter. Maybe even a little sour in the finish. Very different from Trappist counterparts.

Palate: medium body, frothy texture, plenty if carbonation. Medium finish 

Overall: I remember liking this more in the past. The beer is meant to be dry and hoppy by Trappist standards, but this is more so than I remember. Its a very well made beer, but my least favorite of the Trappists. its just not my taste. I have a bottle with 1.5 years on it at home that will be iterating to compare.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","ChrisSc"
956,"2013-10-06",3.7,"Bottle in Urban Tap House, Cardiff. Pours hazy amber, extremely lively. Three fingers of rocky white head despite very slow and careful pour. This bottle may have been bashed around a little... Still, the nose is quite floral and theres funky yeast, with citrus and a little pepperiness. Its nice and citrus in the mouth, with a grassy and bready touch. The yeast is very present. Its quite dry and a tad sour, which wasnt exactly what I expected. But the taste is well balanced and the finish is light bitter, not strong at all. Very pleasant. Light-medium bodied and lively dry mouthfeel.

956,"2013-10-05",4.4,"Finally taking the time to rate the single, seminal product of this trappist brewery. Bottled 8/30/12. Warmed to roughly 60 degrees and poured into a Firestone Walker snifter. The bottle gushed upon opening and I lost about an ounce of liquid. The first pour fills the glass with a sticky, frothy head that dissipates enough to continue pouring. After filling the snifter, the white, frothy head remains, on average, a finger high and leaves mountainous lacing about the glass. My first smell is memorable. Beautiful complexity that doesnt overwhelm. Brettanomyces is prominent, bringing out a very earthy and funky nose. Wet hay, green apple, mango, ripe orange comprise the diverse aroma. Appearance is striking; a wonderful amber-orange capped by that cloud-like head. Taste is elegant and delicious. Most of the hoppiness has faded in this bottle, but there is lingering spiciness and light bitterness that I attribute to the dry hopping used to make this beer. Flavor has notes of bread, red apple, apricot, and a nice bit of funk. Palate is also enjoyable. The beer isnt too heavy, nor is it too light. Finishes dry on the tongue as though someone just wiped my tongue with a paper towel.

Overall, an exquisite beer. I dont like the nearly $6/bottle price, but its certainly worth paying occasionally as this beer is just awesome.","Texas, USA","bootsjohn"

Sugary fruit aroma, apples, candi sugar, grassy, a touch of lemon (?) truly Belgian yeast. 

Sweet upfront, but quickly moves down the tongue to more hoppy bitterness. Apple, banana, bubblegum. Rapidly turns dry and a touch sour mid-palate. Bitter at the back. Overall a highly carbonated body, yet quite 'thin' throughout. Carries the grassy notes to the back of the mouth nicely. Sweet and crisp around the mouth without diacetyl.

956,"2013-07-12",3.4,"From a 2 1/2 year old bottle. Field berries and cherry are introducing the aroma. we can also find a lot of alcohol; ether notes. caramel and earthy notes are also showing up. Aroma is very difficult to evaluate because of that ether presence.
Appearance: Clear amber, off white head, good thickness, rocky and from average to long lasting. Head doesnt stick and no apparent lacing.
Taste: Attack has a well felt bitterness that is lasting quite long. Again ether accents are dominant. We can well feel the bretts that are giving this beer a feel of lambic. The sparkling is perfect and supports the bitterness. Herbal hops are well dosed. Mouth feel is exceptional. The flavor palette is however restricted. A well brewed beer that is not necessarily my favorite. Being refractory to lambics, and this beer has some similarities to that style because of the type of yeast used, it does,t rank into my top favorites.

 b) Older rating from 18. August 2010  Ich teste eine frische (Abgefüllt am 9.6.2010) gegen eine schon ein Jahr gelagerte (Abgefüllt am 3.8.2009) Variante gegeneinander. 

Im Glas schauen beide gleich orange-trüb aus, wobei die ältere Flasche deutlich mehr Schaum im Glas gebildet hat. 

Im Antrunk ist das frische Bier weich herb, die herbe Note setzt sich im Hauptteil fort und wird relativ sehr herb, fast schon penetrant. Dabei leicht säuerlich-spritzig. 

Bei dem älteren Bier hingegen überwiegt die säuerliche, schon fast im Vergleich saure Note und drängt den schwächer gewordenen Hopfen deutlich in den Hintergrund. Auch schmeckt es alkoholisch-vergorener, Aromen von dunklem Trockenobst erscheinen unter der sauren Decke. 
Diese sind bei dem jungen Bier noch überhaupt nicht zu finden. 
Dort überwiegt auch im Nachgeschmack der deutlich grasig-starke Hopfen. Erst zum letzten Teil, wo die Herbe abklingt, kommen mild-weich-fruchtige Aromen ganz leicht hervor. 
Bei der älteren Variante überwiegt im Nachgeschmack die Säure, mild-weiche und dunkle Fruchtaromen sind deutlich ausgeprägt, hinzu kommt eine leichte Hopfenherbe. Die säuerlich-fruchtig-dunkle Note hält sich sehr lange im Mund, das Bier ist mild-weich und zugleich sauer-herb. 

--> Bei genauem ""Hinschmecken"" zwei komplett verschiedene Biere. Auch der unterschiedliche Alkoholgehalt macht sich natürlich bemerkbar.

956,"2013-05-06",4.8,"330ml bottle bought at Belgian Beer Intl. in Tsuen Wan.
Colour -  Cloudy hazy golden amber orange with dirt like yeast sediments.

Head - Explosive four-finger head with crumpety off-white foams which seems to last forever! Very thick and sticky lacing and very fizzy carbonation.

Aroma - Very fragrant and refreshing nice perfume, floral, honey, grapefruit, plum / dark fruit, vanilla, light caramel, light banana, malt, and spices. Grapefruit aroma becomes more intense as the beer warms.

Taste - Muted, light sweet malt, with caramel, burnt toffee, Belgian yeast, liquorices, dark fruit, strong cloves, spices, brett, pretty strong bitter lime, citrus, and herbal hops.

Body - Medium body, quite thin but slick palate.

Mouth Feel - Abbey Dubbel-based, dominated by very strong and herbal hoppiness. Sweetness is really low, fused with intense spiciness, brett, burnt toffee and dark-fruits. 

Hoppiness - this is THE headlines, great in refreshing floral aroma, touch of fresh grapefruit taste, and expressive dynamic bitterness. Wow! Astringency is a tad low, but good enough to leave a lingering nice finish.  

After Taste - Pretty dry, very easy and tempting to mouth.

Comments: With such a cocky bottle and only features one brew, I knew this monastery is up to something and I expect nothing less from its beer. Bang on! It really stands tall against other tasty Trappist beers all by its own - tastes like a fully hopped up Dubbel, hugely impressive visually with big lasting head and lacing; Its floral, perfumey and grapefruit aroma is so refreshing that is a good indication of a well-made and well-hopped beer. Its low sweetness - so subdued - a trait which I normally dont like for Trappists / Abbeys, is well complemented by good dose of clove and spiciness. An altogether unique and great tasting and sensory experience!

I got this beer at my local liquor store without knowing anything about it. It was just another option among all the other beers on the shelf. After coming home though and reading all those positive reviews, I was looking forward to drinking it. Instead, for a bunch of reasons, it stayed in my fridge till now.
A uniquely shaped bottle of 330 ml, with just one small, modest label mentioning the beers name and other info, around the neck of the bottle. Poured into a chalice, after letting it warm up a little bit, since it has a recommended drinking temperature of 12°-14° C. Dark amber coloured, with a two finger head, white in colour, with some yelow spots every here and there.. Foam is thick in texture. Quite a few bubbles rising to the surface. Head has an average retention.Once most of it is gone, a thick enough part stays behindand covers the surface.
Aroma was quite complex when I sniffed it the moment I opened the bottle, with the most obvious smell being a fig aroma.. After smelling it from the glass, I sense plums, pears, some light caramel aromaand maybe some old redgrapes. Great aroma.
Taste is great too, somehow in the middle between fruity sweet and hoppy bitter, with the scale turning on the bitterness side when it comes to the aftertaste. Its very difficult to name some flavours exactly. There are fruity flavours, some clove too. Now I perceive some white wine flavour and some spices too. This beer is so complex, to the point you get another flavour with every sip. Alcohol very well concealed.
Full body with average carbonation, a bit tart on the palate.

Taste is hard to describe, a bit sweet and acidic at first, the carbonation takes a strong hold and then tastes a bit bitter, and after the carbonation recedes youre left with a bitter hoppy flavour.

Deep unclear amber with a lightly tinted head of foam thats fed by lively carbonation.
The nose is a bit sharp, combining yeast, hops and underneath it all a little candy sugar though not much, almost a smell of iron. Pleasant but not exceptional for an amber ale.
The taste is pretty aggressive, quite bitter and citric in the sense of a lime, rather than a more sour fruit. Its that citrussy bitterness that also keeps it from falling into the category refreshing.
The carbonation goes well with the ""bite"" of the first taste.
A delicate bitterness remains in the aftertaste as well as the faintest hint of sourness but little else, a fine taste but not that complex all in all.

Was für ein Bier, unglaublicher Nektar! Gerade mal ein Jahr alt seit seiner Abfüllung, sprudelt es mit reichlich feinem Schaum im Berliner Weiße Glas. Hell-rötlich-trüb ist die Optik. Das Aroma ist einzigartig komponiert: Pfirsich-Cidre-Malzig-Hefig-Bierig, toll!! Die Fruchtigkeit herrscht auch im Geschmack reichlich vor, dann kommt ein vollmundiger Körper. Die Süße des Malzes endet in einem hölzernen Bitterton. Das soll ein Bier sein? Unglaublicher Nektar! Die restlichen Flaschen dürfen noch zwei, drei Jahre vor sich hin schlummern. Die mangelnde Ausgewogenheit dürfte dann auch ihre Ecken und Kanten verloren haben. Orval ist große Klasse!

Oily texture, richly carbonated with a light to medium body and a lingering, dry finish. I can see the influence from this on beers like Anchorage Whiteout and the socalled white IPA style.

956,"2012-08-25",3.9,"11.2 oz bottle poured into a tulip.

A: Pours a dark golden color with strong yeast haze and a translucent shine near the bottom of the glass. The head is a two finger offwhite color that settles down to one finger, leaving thick clumps of lacing on the glass.

S: Subtle spicing (such as ginger and coriander), along with a bright malt background and pleasant barnyard funk. A little weak, but a solid scent otherwise.

T: Quite bready, but not sweet at all...in fact, its a little bitter, especially in conjunction with its predominant funk note. Exhales give off light fruit esters such as pear. A bit of an acquired taste; the first sip is slightly off, but once the impressive complexity and light accumulating funk do their work on the tongue, it becomes quite balanced and nicely nuanced.

M: Somewhat heavy, with a finishing dry astringency. Its not as carbonated (or as bloated) as some Belgians are, giving it nice drinkability.

O: Great beer, but this stuff really needs to be paired with some good cheese to allow its character to truly come through. This really isnt for everyone, so keep that in mind - it gets high marks more for its craftsmanship than anything.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

956,"2012-08-08",5.0,"Un archétype de la bière. Une référence absolue, ou encore ce que lon pourrait appeler une
mesure étalon.
En matière de bière trappiste pourtant, elle est tout à fait particulière en terme de goût et elle
occupe une niche à part entière.
Mais elle est réellement trappiste dans lapproche qualitative, dans certains aspects visuels
tels que la mousse dite « à cratères », cest-à-dire une mousse épaisse qui donne un peu
la consistance du blanc doeuf battu, et dans laquelle se forme des creux en cercles qui 
ressemblent à des cratères de volcan.
Volcanique est un qualificatif qui conviendrait bien à cette bière, parce quelle est très vivante
à louverture de la bouteille, et dans le verre (celui de la maison bien entendu) elle présente 
une vivacité énorme avec des bulles très rapides et qui se comptent par milliers : impressionnant...
Ses arômes très typés sont également dune générosité extraordinaire.
Ils embaument vraiment la pièce où vous dégustez, et ils sont dune typicité phénoménale.
Comme je le dis personnellement, cette bière sent lécurie. Dans le bon sens du terme 
évidemment, à savoir la paille fraîche et une certaine odeur de cuir que le cheval dégage.
Une odeur également avec une certaine âcreté dans des proportions très agréables, et une
pointe dacidité, du type ammoniaque mais en proportions pharmaceutiques.
De la pharmacie du Bon Dieu, sans aucun doute, puisque les saints pères se sont penchés sur 
son baptême. Et ils prennent soin du divin enfant avec une patience et une rigueur énorme.
Avec un soin de bénédictin et une qualité dans les ingrédients, qui relèvent presque de la 
charité chrétienne, tant cette bière est naturelle et pure.
Je lai choisie soigneusement pour ma 100ème critique parce que nulle autre bière ne peut
être considérée comme une référence de ce type.
Pour moi, bien que située en Gaume, elle fait partie des fôrets de la Semois, avec le cerf
qui les parcourt et qui brame quant vient lautomne.
Elle est vraiment une perle dans lart du brassage, et une valeur à nulle autre pareille dans 
la qualité de conception et du goût.
Je ne souhaite pas détailler ce goût, tant il est riche et complexe. Il doit réellement entrer 
en vous par la dégustation que vous faites de cette bière, et il constituera nécessairement
une référence qui vous permettra dévaluer dautres bières.
Donc avis à ceux qui lont goûtée un peu distraitement : il faut y revenir, mettre tous ses 
sens en action, tous les compteurs sur « on », et on aura immanquablement une base de
travail et dévaluation pour les bières dans leur ensemble.
Une bière hors catégorie donc, comme certains cols du tour de France, qui est une valeur
en soi, et pour laquelle les chiffres ne veulent rien dire.
Si vous en voulez un, alors disons le nombre détoiles quil y a dans le ciel....","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

A: Hazy burnt orange color. The head is massive and has many different sized bubbles surrounding a meringue crest. Awesome lacing. Also, there is a notable effervescence that emanates from the bottom center of the glass and resembles an underwater volcano.

T: Interesting to say the least. I dont think one could ever describe Orval as dull or uninteresting. Immediately upon tasting, I get a funky, dry tartness that remains prevalent throughout. Its not the type of funk found in a wild ale, lambic or gueuze. What a cool brew. There is a slight alcohol note in the finish, but its subtle enough and fits in nicely.

Später ist die herbe nicht mehr ganz so intensiv (immernoch weit überdurchschnittlich) und das grasige verfliegt fast vollständig, dafür kommt eine mild säuerliche fruchtige-citrusnote zum Vorschein, so das es herb und leicht säuerlich schmeckt. Im Nachgeschmack schmeckt es immernoch herb und die anderen Aromen sind kaum noch zu schmecken da sie übertünscht werden. Ein leckeres frisches Bier das schon fast an ein IPA erinnert.

Appearance (5/5): Pours a cloudy, medium honey-amber hue. Frothy, off white, three finger, lasting head with good lacing. Light sediment. Extremely attractive.

Aroma (9/10): Dominant orange and grapefruit, perfume, cinnamon, and a little black pepper; a little caramel, wood, and some yeasty notes of dough and barnyard. Very, very nice. The citric-perfume is noticeable the moment you open the bottle.

Taste (8/10): Dry aromatic citrus sums up this beer. Begins with sweet citrus and caramel, quickly turning to a moderately bitter, spicy finish. The yeast comes out at the end to give a slightly acidic feel to the finish. 

Palate (4/5): Medium body, lively carbonation, oily, then very dry texture, dry and ever so slightly astringent finish. Very smooth and enveloping mouthfeel. Even though its quite bitter, it doesnt feel harsh at all.

Overall (18/20): This is a very good, very well balanced, very sophisticated beer. Everything works together perfectly. Very unlike the other Trappist ales; dry, hoppy, relatively light body. Definitely has its own unique wow factor that i cant quite describe.

956,"2012-02-22",4.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 5/14/2009.   Poured into a tulip.

While pouring this, I moved from pouring slowly down the side to dropping the beer in the center, and the head simply exploded, Duvel style. The carbonation keeps replenishing while there is still beer in the glass as well. This is a nice dark orange and copper color, with a monster head that leaves all kinds of sticky lacing on the glass. Very nice.

A little bit light in the smell department. Some citrus and apple aromas, along with a variety of spices.

By far the best aspect of this beer is the taste. I get some strong tart flavor with the malt up front, mostly apple and maybe some grape. A nice blend of nutmeg and even a little cinnamon is present throughout the sip. The hops are fairly light and citrusy in nature, leaving me with more of a tart than a true bitter taste on my palate. Quite tasty and definitely unique.

The mouthfeel is actually a little bit light, which I would not have expected from the darker color. A nuanced breadiness stays on my tongue, giving it a little bit of texture.

Very easy to drink. After what seemed like just a sip, I looked down and I was almost done with the glass. Very smooth, propped up by a nice level of carbonation and a crisp, balanced flavor. 
After my first try, I think that I will have to sample a few more of these, in order to accustom myself to the different taste. I did not feel it was ""dirty"" or ""funky"" as a few other reviewers thought, but maybe I will get those senses next time I drink it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Its almost Buddhist in terms of focus and perfection. The pour is a cloudy pale copper similar to apple cider in color and consistency with a thin frothy head that proves to be quite resilient. The palate, crisp and clean, med-light bodied, finished with a fizz. I found the taste to be fronted by a light hop followed by tart apples, bright fruit notes, a little muted hay taste, and bitter finish that mellows back to a sweet fruit - the perfect aftertaste in my opinion.

956,"2012-01-04",4.7,"Purchased at Breeze Thru Liquors in Milwaukee, WI; enjoyed while nursing a bum elbow after a long day at work...needed a nice treat.  Appearance is like a magical potion, dark orange/amber with a rich, frothy white head, tons of tiny carbonation bubbles rising to the top.  Aroma has a lot going on.  Theres a flood of fruity esters mixed with floral hops, mixed in with a complex Belgian yeast, also has a sour/stinky cheese like quality in the nose.  Outstanding smell.  Taste is extremely complex.  Starts slightly tart, becomes increasingly bready, finishes with a slight citrus hops flavor but retains the tart/bread qualities.  Theres not much anyone could change about this brew, its been brewed for the better half of a century to near perfection.  For my style it doesnt get a 5, but it definitely is one of the best all around beers Ive ever had.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"
956,"2012-01-04",4.1,"Pours hazy amber with a one finger white head that dissipates quickly.  The nose is some bread, cheese with citrus and herbal notes.  Some caramel thrown in as well.   Taste is not your typical trappist.  Its quite bitter compared to other trappist beers.  There is an earthy funk to it as well, similar to what you get with brett.  Mouthfeel is slick, crisp and long lasting.  This is not in my opinion the best trappist beer, however, it is my favorite!","San Diego, California, USA","dreadnord"
956,"2012-01-03",4.5,"11.2oz bottle poured into a goblet.

Appearance is a hazy dark orange with a 2 finger thick white head. Retention is awesome. The head simply refuses to fade away!

Smell is very orangy and yeasty with also a bit of juniper.

Taste is citrusy up front with apple and orange. Orange being predominant. There is also a woody note along with a slight tartness from the yeast. Bitterness is present throughout but really becomes noticeable toward the finish. The beer finishes with a long lasting dryness.

956,"2011-12-08",5.0,"Ooh my.  My first $5, 11.2oz bottle was an October 10th, 2010, consumed on December 6th, 2011 (14 months).  It was hands down the best beer Ive ever had, for many reasons:

-Smells like a complex fruity wine
-Pours a reddish brown with TONS of fluffy foam
-Tastes of fresh fruit, quite a bit of hops, some fruity acidicy, medium-long finish turning slightly bitter in the end.  Unlike anything else Ive tasted.  Its like the first second of an IPA but for 5 seconds, then finishing without the overwhelming bitterness.  This is the most well-balanced thing Ive had, and the head is ridiculous.

The second bottle I had was a 20/05/2011 consumed on 8/12/2011 (so, a bit under 7 months old).  I can really taste the difference between this and the 14-month old bottle I had before.  This one isnt quite as complex, but has a bit of a metallic flavor.  Still very well balanced, but Id really encourage you to find an older bottle or wait it out, based on what Ive tasted here.  This younger bottle has more acidity and a bit less pillowly carbonation.  Im also getting more fresh dough at the end.  Definitely good and very drinkable, but again the older bottle was out of this world whereas this bottle is more similar to other things Ive had.

Appearance: Pours a hazy orange caramel color with a huge 4 finger thick and creamy off-white head. A touch of sediment pools right on top of the billowy head. The head was so big it rose a full 2 fingers above the rim of the goblet. Perfect head retention. Halfway through the glass and its still got a 1/2 finger head. Excellent lacing.

956,"2011-10-10",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2016 I guess Im one of those who fell for this beer. I just love it. I used to drink it everyday. The aroma is very yeasty but you can dig the citrus hops without much effort. I must say that the appearance makes this beer look like somebody didnt much care about looks. I like it flat so I pur orval in a ruff way in a humid glass so it loose a bit of the carbonation : I use for it a much larger glass then it should be. Otherwise there would be to much foam in my mounth. There is so many things you might say about the first taste : well balanced light sweetnes and freshness of hops but you forget quickly after you swallow because its the grapefruit taste that dominates. When you take a year old bottle then allready on the beginning you feel much more the sourness and very interresting bitterness. Overall this beer has allmighty grapefruit like aftertaste and when you get more then 4 bottles of it you still don""t feel like you had enough of it (contrary to a grapefruit itself). 
This is my best beer. If I add to this that this beer contains no sugar left after fermantation and you gor yourself a great everyday beer. Unfortunatly even here in belgium you might have troubles to find it regulary on the shop shelves.","Warszawa, POLAND","Swaroga"

Quite fruity overall with flavours of plums, passion fruit and a lovely bone dry finish. Im really enjoying this, much more than previously. Brett is definitely present but Id love more.

956,"2011-09-27",3.7,"08 Bottle of Orval shared by Jared @ Woodshop Classix. You were probably one of the few people actually sticking to the theme! A true classic, and a vintage no less.  Pour is a fairly clear hay yellow with an almost pulpy orange juice appearance -- only much lighter. Delicate sea foams form, which is always a plus with an aged bottle, but they quickly rejoin the body with almost no retention or lacing. A light creamy film swirls over the top of the beer like creams in coffees. Smell is a little bit of sour dough with some gobs of honey, spices, and perhaps juniper (struck me as gin-like). Taste is really light and mellow -- perhaps some faded orange or lemon zest, but its so very light. Mostly bready biscuity malts that seem too light and mellow to ever rise in an oven. Still very crisp and drying though. I thought this drank pretty well considering the age, I didnt think it would be quite like this. This really hit me quite differently from what I can remember fresh, but I do know that Ive enjoyed this beer in both forms. I surprisingly good beer to age, but Id love to try this ultra fresh on location someday.","Palm Desert, California, USA","cavery"

the aromas are backed up by a real smooth and delicious medium/full body. good depth on the flavors as well with the flavors mostly being more oranges and bits of citrus hops+malts.

Intense but very well-balanced and very much enjoyed and savored. This is definitely a brew to sit back and enjoy ice cold and then savor the flavors as they change while the brew slowly warms. This is also a very aromatic brew that had me wishing they would make a dangly air freshener made with this scent!

956,"2011-09-05",4.3,"This is one of my favorite trappist beers. While it has such less alcohol in it (which I like) its so complex. First off, I dont like this beer cold, give me the cellar temperature which doesnt kill the taste as a fridge does. Orval has a huge difference when its older. Even after 1 year it is much better. If you can get your hands on an older one (6m-1year), please do so. Amabassadors from Orval need to provide you with cellar ones and older ones, so just pay those 2 extra or so, its definitely worth it!
As for the taste, its a bitter one, but a very complex bitter one. While bitter IPA style beers are amongs my favourites, this is certainly just another bitter one!
I also tried one from 1989 which wasnt good anymore, i guess 1-5 years is best for this superb beer.","BELGIUM","tquest"

4.5 A: Plenty of carbonation in this one. The first pour yielded 80% head. Hazed medium orange color. Second pour gave me a full glass. Three fingers of pillowy white head with excellent retention. Rather than just lacing, there are gobs of head permanently stuck to the sides of the glass.

I caught some subtle berry flavors too, maybe from the yeast, like raspberry but not quite.  Has a fairly prominent sugary profile with loads of carbonation.

I have never had anything quite like this beer-- the bartender told me this brewery only makes one beer because thats all it really needs to make.  I agree.

When I drank it it was chilled to the bone and that wasnt doing the Orval much good. After warming it with my hands it evolved into a whole different beer. It has aromas of candy sugar that gives it a royal sweetness, followed by a tasty hopbitternes finish. Again, this beer is best enjoyed just below room temperature and really not on fridge temperature. So store it in the cellar, the attic or the garden shed or whatever.

956,"2011-05-15",3.7,"A surprisingly long-lasting fizz is heard when I remove the cap from the beautiful bottle, and when carefully pouring the dark amber beer into my trappist chalice I understand why: this is one aggressively carbonated brew! An enormous, creamy, off-white head builds up extremely quickly, and I need to take several breaks in order to fit all of the beer into the glass. Initially the body looked rather clear, but I guess the long pouring process and the high carbonation caused some sediments to be whirled up, so the beer ended up looking rather cloudy. The aroma is amazing and very unusual (at least to me): hoppy with flowers, pine and apple, along with dark spices, wine and oak. Light sweet and light bitter taste with a light to moderate bitter finish. The flavour is dominated by the dark parts of the aroma: oak, fermented apples and leather. Medium body with a very dry texture, and the carbonation ends up as rather average. The dryness and the oak and fermented apples actually reminds me of a brut nature champagne Great stuff, although not at the very top, but I suspect this will grow on me on time. So, Orval, are you ready for a re-rating in a few months time?

Well, this beer is a whole different story to me now. I do get it. Pours golden color, massive, lasting head, sweet aroma of peaches, and spice.

Ive been whiffing it for a while now and just loving it, but alas it needs to be drank!  Has a sour, bitter taste to it.  Citrus and some caramel in there. Yeasty, somewhat peppery.  The spices here are absolutely wonderful and perfectly blended in...nothing to me sticks out so much, it all just seems perfectly balanced to create this unique flavor.  If it had anything that was overly obvious it would be the mostly sour tone that just kinda envelops your tongue...first few sips I was taken back by it, not in a good/bad way I guess, just...more surprised than anything!  I wish I was a bit better with words, or could quite place what Im tasting because it definitely reminds me of so many things, but I cant quite put them down right now.  Ill update this if it comes to me.  All in all, this is one of my absolute favorite beers Ive had; and I mean ever.

Aroma is citrus, a touch of grass, some hay, floral and citrus hops.  Light sweet malt.  A touch of tartness and light barnyard funk.  Nice and complex without being overpowering.  Flavor is not nearly so complex.  Sweetish malts, a slug of yeast (complete with standard Belgian fusels and esters), a tiny bit of tartness and funk, with some floral hops on the very back end.

Aroma is a combination of the best American Imperial IPA you have ever smelled and the best Flemish Sour you have ever smelled.  It is pure winning.  The flavor is incredibly hoppy, and its a nice dry, piney hoppiness.  Like a really heavily hopped Bohemian Pilsner.  There is also a subdued sweet malt presence throughout.  The sour brett characteristics come in after the initial hoppy punch.  There are sour, funky, farmhousey flavors, lots of orange and even a little grapefruit.  This is an incredibly complex beer.  The finish is War and Peace long and every bit as complex as the initial flavors of the beer.

This beer is extremely creamy, with well attenuated pale malts, and vaguely soapy hops moving into leathery brett funk (moldy, but in a good way!). Rounding out the end is lingering funk and tannic astringency. The tongue is slightly warmed by alcohol alongside the aftertaste, which sticks around practically forever.

The palate was deceptively lighter/thinner than it appears and smells it would be; it has a fresh and sprite feel to it and is dry.

There is a slight bitter finish and the taste is very dry - almost too dry for me, I feel like I am missing out on some flavor, like it should be there but isnt.

956,"2011-02-13",4.4,"Orval, my 4th Trappist brewery tasted (5th if you count St. Bernardus), comes in a 11.2 fluid ounce brown, mini 750ml Belgian/French styled/shaped bottle with a trout holding a ring in its mouth on the label. Bottled on 22/01/2009, best before 22/2014. Definitely when I find this a little cheaper at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee I will buy a few to cellar. This bottle is lightly chilled.

This is a fizzer, pours (sediment and all) unlimited off-white head with large bubbles into my Duvel glass. The head recedes fairly quickly leaving huge lumps of lacing behind. not the best looking Trappist ale. The beer itself is a hazy oranginsh brown, caramel colored almost. Ive heard with a sediment free pour this is actually a very clear brew.

Smell is the best Ive encountered with a Trappist ale. It has a potent farmhouse saison style scent with some fruity sourness, a nice dose of yeast twang, some tropical fruit, white raisin, lemons, and a hint of spice. A very exotic smell, and a good one indeed.

Taste carries over with all the above scents as flavors, and more. It seems even fruitier and more saison-like, tart with a tad bit of cloying bittersweetness in the finish, the cloying taste lasts only the first sip. The spices and yeast are a bit more pronounced in the taste as well. It has a slightly bitter aftertaste with a hint of sour green apple and a bit of hops. It is smooth drinking with the right amount of carbonation, a bit of wateriness mid-drink, and a dry finish. It is whole heartedly complex in taste, scent, and mouthfeel; the appearance seems to be the least flashy/unique attribute to this beer.

The alcohol is hidden pretty well, you get hints of it here and there but nothing overpowering. It warms slightly as it goes. Nothing that would prevent me form at least having another despite the 6.9%abv.

Overall this is a fine Trappist ale, not the pinnacle but on the upper tier. It is the most unique and possibly the most complex one I have had so far. This is also beer #250 tasted for me, hoorah.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

The head on this one was massive, and I had to let it settle for quite a while to down it without experiencing a carbonation explosion.The aroma is primarily sour apples, spices and a little musk lolly. Taste wise, there is a touch of spicy sweetness up front, but its dominated by a tart, sour apple taste, and is exceptionally dry (has definite wine like qualities). Perhaps I just got a dud bottle (which is rather lovely from an aesthetic standpoint), but this proved to be a massive disappointment given its score on here.

Ive drunk Orval from as young as 2 months to 7years old. Evolves quite fast, would suggest to leave it at least 6 months. At its best after about 2 years.

Takes forever to recede and leaves rings of foamy, bubbly lacing and a rocky island behind.  Aroma features the most authentic bubblegum aroma Ive encountered, very grassy, floral and herbal, spices, some lemon, a bit of orange, as well as some funk buried underneath.  Complex and strong aroma.  Flavor is fruity apples, lemon, orange, pear, bubblegum, some spice, some tartness up front, then a bit of caramel sweetness in the middle transitioning to a touch more spice and an overall dry finish.  Mouthfeel is light to medium, low carbonation, a little creamy and sometimes sticky.  My first Orval, unique, definitely.

There are a lot of green grape notes, with a funky peppery yeast quality. More sweet fruits tickle the nose with a solid alcohol lift. The flavor has a peppery spice base that lends to a gentle complexity of fruits, namely grapes, lemon, and apple cider. Quite tart surprisingly. The body is superb, as most Belgians seem to perfect. It is light and airy with a zippy carbonation giving wonderful drinkability. This honestly is not what I expected at all.

Taste brings forward the funk in a not so unstrained way. Something about it just doesnt balance. This is about a year old, and I think the hops and the funk just might be quite out of balance at this point, with the semi-aged hops detracting from the overall package. Mouthfeel is dry and well carbonated. Drinkability is average; nowhere near Westvleteren Blonde. Ill have to get a fresh bottle and see if it fares any better.

956,"2010-09-06",4.8,"Orvall is arguably the most recognizable and respected of all the Trappist breweries, save perhaps for Chimay.  Orval is immediately identifiable by their unusual bottle shape.  It looks like a small brown bowling pin.  

12 ounce bottled pulled into a rudimentary glass chalice.  I poured this one slowly and tossed out a bit to avoid having the beer overpowered by the yeast cake on the bottom of the bottle.  The beer is tangerine in color, more orange than I remember.  Its the color of sun tea.  Small bubbles make up a larger rocky head.  Nice lacing that looks a lot like dish soap.  Solid inch worth of head on this one, even with my conservative pouring efforts.  Smell is amazing, intoxicating.  I get some light hits of yeasty clove and bananas to start things off, before things get a little more hefty.  Theres a strong fruit presence here, with some cherry standing out for me.  Im also getting a distinct apple presence.  Combined with the malt profile its almost like smelling a hot apple pie.  Theres also some clear earthy barnyard funkiness going on.  Mouthfeel is light, almost to the point of effervescence, and theres very little in terms of bitterness.  

I havent had Orval in quite some time.  My first real drink in a long while just takes the concept of Trappist beer and turns it directly on its ear.  Huge amount of dry and musky Brett yeast can be found through out the beer, adding an incredible amount of flavor.  Hop character is relatively muted, though its there up front.  Reminds me of pear cactus.  While theres a ton of things going on, the beer remains an absolute joy to drink.  The light body makes this a very quaffable beer, though the flavor profile encourages you to meander.  As the beer warms it offers you more, as the brett notes start to highlight more of the caramel malt profile.  

Those with a patient palate will find that this beer offers a level of enjoyment few others can match.  For me, its so good it borders on ridiculous.  Theres really nothing to fault within this beer.  Impecablle, simply incomparable.  Highly recommended.",", Missouri, USA","VengefulOdin"

Flavor: Distinctly earthy, bisquity, a little tart grapefruit, toasted, dry caramel. These flavors sail on into the dry finish. A firm, sharp bitterness supports the flavors.
Comments: The flavors and mouth feel is drier than the sweet nose suggests. The palate is also deceptive as the full, rustic flavors are carried on a relatively light-medium bodied ale.  A great choice for a staple beer--one to always have on hand for yourself or company.

Starts with an over-the-top beige foam tower filling 9/10 the glass then condensing in a more suitable copper body. Clean sanitized yeastiness in the nose, nothing to interesting--as if it was stripped of all yeast funk. The body again showcases this sanitized antiseptic flavor with hints of soapiness. Muted hops, mostly lacking in flavor.  Dryish. Incredibly underwhelming and pretty poor in quality. Still, my rating is probably too generous.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"

Sweet yet tart in taste with spice and funk.  Flavours of dried fruits and foliage with just a touch of juniper berries.  Carbonation is effervescent; the body is medium thin.

The flavour profile is also interesting and very complex -  with varying degrees of sweet, bitter, sour, even some salinity, and umami at the end of the glass (is that from the yeast sediment ?) it has it all.

Nice Belgian sweetness fills the air immediately. Taste has some nice drinkable qualities, but I can see how some people cant take to it. Note quite as sweet as the nose, but showing a little dryness. Firm and tiny carbonation bubbles. A bit of spiciness that keeps this from being just another malty beer.

956,"2010-05-03",4.7,"11.2oz bottle.  Hazy orange-tan color, with a massive off-white head.  Sweet Brett, hop aroma.  I really find different nuances in this beer every time I have it.  This bottle is coming off very fruity and funky to me.  Lots of underlying wheat flavors.  Such a unique mouthfeel.  Not quite sour, but very reminiscent of Lambics.  Somewhat sandy on the palate, the hops deliver a straightforward bitterness.  Incredible depth.  Fruity Belgian yeast notes.  Wow.  An absolute masterpiece of a beer.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
956,"2010-05-02",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 2, 2011 Bottle. Poured a murky amber with some orange undertones and a huge white foamy head that was mostly diminishing but had fantastic lacing. 

The aroma was heavy of a straw like malt, a moderate floral hop and a moldy scented yeast with notes of dried fruit (raisins), a hint of spice and some citrus (lemon and maybe orange) with a mild alcohol tinge. 

It tasted a malty, a little bitter and slightly sour with a hint of a peppery spice in the beginning and finished lightly bitter and yeasty with notes of fruit, citrus and a slight alcohol tinge at the end. The flavor was left to linger for a while, leaving a light sourness on the palate.

Mouthfeel was light to medium in body and a little oily in texture with the carbonation being quite pronounced, almost prickly in feel.

Overall a fantastic Trappist Ale, I can see now why the Monks only brew this one beer.","Macon, North Carolina, USA","KajII"

Taste is somewhat confusing- a fizzy champagne like character and dryness with a slightly thicker body midway through also having a cereal quality that I cant put my finger on, guessing that it was from the yeast. Definite hints of spice and delicate hops. Finishes crisp and light.  The beer did get markably better in both taste in palatte the more I drank.

956,"2010-04-21",3.9,"A- This is one beautiful beer. Cloudy translucent pale yellow body that pours with giant 3+ finger white head that slowly settles to 1 1/2 finger and with great retention. Plenty of lacing is left behind in the glass.

S- Floral hops are noticed first followed by Belgian yeast and a peppery spice-somewhat of a funky ale yeast strain.

T- Initial taste is dominated by carbonation but lots of Belgian yeast and hints of peppery spice can be detected. The finish is a kick of bitter hops and peppery spice that was surprising to me considering the style. Lingering is a mild hop bitterness and hints of yeast and peppery spice.

P- High carbonation and medium weight body heavy in yeast and alcohol. Not as smooth as I expected on the swallow.

O- I am probably harsh since this is a style that I like and it just didnt live as far up to my expectations. It is actually good and easy to drink overall but it doesnt stand out to me. I would it buy it much more often if it were more affordable.

956,"2010-04-17",4.3,"11.2 oz bottle into Trappist glass. 2007 bottle. Funky aroma--smells like a sour ale. Brett, anyone? Perfume-like scent comes out after sitting for a bit. Pours yellowish brown with nice creamy lacing and a long-retaining off-white head. Taste is sour and a bit medicinal at first (this goes away fairly quick). Maybe a tad watery; fully carbonated. Nice aftertaste. This is the strangest Trappist Ive ever had. If one were to personify all the Trappist ales and put them in a line, Orval would be the one with the tattered robe adorned with spiked tassles and a pierced nostril.

956,"2010-04-11",4.0,"Bottle.

A - Hazy light copper orange with a huge frothy, creamy white head. Excellent retention with a good thick lacing left.

S - Complex smell. Good mix of tangy and funky smell. You get a lot of tangy and zesty orange and lemon along with some pear. There is a slight alcohol and winey smell as well. A bit of pepper smell comes out. The Brett funk comes out a lot as well with a bit of horse blanket smell. A good, complex mix of citrus, tangy, sweet, spiced, funky smells. 

T - Quite different from the smell. A good amount of medicinal and metallic taste are upfront. There is also a bit of lemony citrus zest along with that. There is a strong funky Brett taste in the background as well. Even fainter is a bit of herbal hops, a bit of pepper, and some white wine like flavors. Interesting and complex, but I didnt find it incredibly enjoyable. I did like it better the more I drank though.

M - Light to medium body with above average carbonation. Fairly creamy but a bit drying at the end.

D - Well the taste was interesting, and I kept wanting to drink more to discover more flavors and get a better handle on the beer. It went down easy and was somewhat refreshing, but the taste wasnt great, and I probably wouldnt drink a number of these in a night. 

Notes: Bottled on 06/10/2009. Very interesting beer that is completely different from the other Trappist beers. Definitely had a funky Brett taste, I was just hoping for a bit more fruity taste to go with it. Not a bad beer, but i might get some getting used to. I did start liking it better the more I drank it.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

956,"2010-03-30",3.9,"Time to get on this classic monolith of a beer. Pouring: big, soap-bubbly head topping off a nice looking light brown body, just about as deep in color as you can get and still passing it off as a blonde ale... Smell is great; grassy and floral, with a fruity hop aroma and hints of bread and pine in between. The first taste gives me something I can only describe as a dry-hopped bun flavor, a very complex and original combination. The palate is all right, without being very notable. As I progress, faint citrus tones start to come up. Some yeast as well, without going all tripel on me. Fresh and tasty, and such a counterpart to the usually sweet, dark Trappist ales. Bitter floral hop aftertaste, perhaps a bit more than I like. Still, Orval is a monolith in the world of beer, not to be underestimated.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

Anyway this is my 2000 rating so I change my mind and will try to put down a few words in celibration. Its a bit unclear orange body with lots of small bubbles and a thick lasting white head. Aroma is not strong, but very nice. Its mainly citric fruity with a pleasant funky Bret stamp. Usually I manage to identify citric fruit, sometimes it seems to be more grapefruit and other times oranges. I can smell a delicate hint of spices, maybe coriander of maybe something else, there is yeast and also hints of older hops. Bret is always present, sometimes more acidic than other times, but never very strong acidity. Flavor has a lot in common with aroma, and always feels very refreshing and quaffable. Mild malt, sometimes hint of caramel, fruity like citrus, mild, dry bitterness, spices, refreshing acidity and a soft and balanced finish with bitterness, acid and sweetness in harmony.

Nose is funky, saddle blanket yeast with some intense earthy notes and mild fruit. Flavor was also funky, light hops, some hints of sour fruit. Light to medium in body and  quite dry. I enjoyed this beer more as I made my way through it. (3.9, drank in NYC c. 2009/2010)Bottle at home in London - picked up from Selfridges. Bottled in 2012, best by 2017, drank in 2013. Yeah, damn solid stuff. Not totally taken over by the brett - which I love - so still has a bit of bready sweetness. But it does have a decent dose of funk to it, so Id say its somewhere in the middle between totally sweet and bready and totally funked. Excellent beverage. (4.3)Bottle at home in London, 13 days before leaving Queens Gardens. Bottled on 15 January 2015. Fairly dry, not too funky, with nice leathery character, some melon, maybe citrus and berries.

956,"2010-02-06",4.5,"Vertical tasting of a fresh and a relatively old vintage. 
The older one bottled on 13/03/2007, the younger is from 08/10/2009. 

Appearance: The younger one is a cloudy golden with much more weaker-airy head than the older one has. The older one is more attractive with lively, effervescent look and huge white, cottony froth.
The 2007 ones definitely better in head lacing and retention. While the older vintage is a lot more closer to deep copper but doesnt seems to hazy or muddy.

Aroma: The 2009 is a lot more intense in the citrusy hop profile with invinting brett-yeasty tartness. The older sample is more mellow on the dry-hoppy profile, but theres some really nice molded-cheesy yeasty profile with moderate tartness and slight lactic hint, maybe lactobacillus(?).

Flavor: The younger is insanely effervescent - even after 20 minutes of air-conditioning. Barnyardy, earthy bretty notes instantly. Then follows a serious dry hoppy peppery-citrusy tartness. Dry, quenching finish. 
The older one shows more depth in the bretty, tart, moldy character, but some dry hoppy resins also detectable.
Moutfeel/Palate: Not surprisingly, the younger one is lot more refresing with lively citrusy hop oils, resins, fizzy carbonation and medium body.
The 3 year old vintage is a somewhat stickier bodied with smooth texture and soft carbonation. 
Overall: First of all: ORVAL is a word-classic beer with no manner of doubt. This a hop-oriented quenching, fizzy, easy-bodied ale, and doesnt age as well as youd expect.
There is no huge malty, sweet backbone, but the wild-yeast strains could do a very amazing job during the bottle-fermentation.

956,"2010-01-11",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2010 Serving date: 2009-01-20. Served in snifter. Bottled 2008-06-20, best before 2013-06-20. 

The beer is amber-colored with red hues, and a bit hazy due to the bottle conditioning and the rather large amount of yeast in the bottle (left most of it in the bottle, though). It develops a big, bubbly and uneven head, despite poured in a quite wide-bodied snifter. The head is almost white, with a light yellow/orange shade, and settles very very slowly. It actually never disappear. Instead it leaves a thick coat of foam. Rocky and airy lacings clings to the glass. This one really pleases the visual faculty.

The smell is of lemon, grass, weeds and sweet, fruity aromas, coupled with a pleasant note of yeast.

In the taste, lemon peel is mixed with yeast and very faint notes of unripe tart fruits. A hint of pine needles is there as well. Then, a taste of grass and hey enters the picture together with a very mild barnyard funkiness (horse blanket?). Just before the finish, it develops a sharp twang - perhaps a result of hops. The finish is tart at first, then develops a subtle bitterness leaving a long and dry sensation in the mouth. Overall, the taste of this beer is really great with levels of complexity. Basically every sip offers something new. However, the true highlight is the balance between the different flavors - everything is composed in a precise and very pleasant manner.

As with the taste, this beer offers a rather unique mouthfeel. At first, with the plentiful foam playing an important part, its quite smooth and full. However, this quickly changes into a a medium, almost light, body with the lively carbonation providing a sharp and crisp feeling to it.

This is a fantastic beer with an original and unique profile. A true masterpiece from start to finish.

Slightly malty and fruity with some sharp flavours similar to citrus oil and blue cheese.  The medicinal flavour that ruined the last one is only very subtle in this one.  Light bodied, heavy carbonation with a dry finish of citrus oil.  Still pretty hard to drink but this time around it gets 7 4 5 3 11 = 3.0.  Final scores averaged.

Previous: Dec 29, 2009.  330mL bottle, bottled 01/2009. Pours an effervescent cloudy amber-gold with a large, fluffy and persistent head which gives some nice lacing.  Aroma is acidic, almost vinous, fruity (particularly banana), with some cheese.  There’s a faint malty and hoppy flavour that’s almost immediately overpowered by volatile medicinal flavours which particularly reminded me of spearmint toothpaste.  Almost one dimensional.  Mildly sour and bitter.  Medium bodied and smooth on the palate with the aforementioned toothpaste finish.  This one certainly didn’t live up to the anticipation. 5 4 3 3 5 = 2.0","Canberra, AUSTRALIA","Mjollnir"

A strong hoppy citrus aroma fills the air as if I just opened up an imperial IPA. But there is more to the aroma, some leathery blue cheese smell that sounds but is not anywhere near disgusting. Flavor starts off very bitter with hops screaming for attention. Then gently becomes more subtle, somewhat creamy and fruity like a good peach yogurt but then shifts back again for an insanely dry finish. The huge amounts of carbonation allow for a lovely mouthfeel. Wonderful beer.","Den Haag, NETHERLANDS","Vaiz"

The taste starts with a good hop bite, followed by some fruitiness and caramel sweetness. Quite pithy and dry, with a lemon/grapefruit zest to it, as well as some spiciness and some ""leather funk"" from the yeast strain. The finish is moderately bitter and dry, with some subtle citrus notes. The mouthfeel is pretty smooth, although there is some crisp carbonation.

The aroma was quite fruity, with damasc, banana and some berries. There was some nice barley malt aroma with it, more wheat aromas and little oat-malt-like aromas as well. The clover that came along was really good, joined with some cinnamon. Hoppy fella, the aroma.

This beer looks great: its opague dark orange mixes with the clear beige foam gently. And, let me say, what a foam: consistent, perfectly sized and quite regular inspite of being quite fluffy.

Into the mouth it came softly, going very swiftly in the whole mouth, filling it quickly with its taste. The fruits come nicely, damasc, banana, berries and some might say something of apple. Along with the fruits there was cinnamon, clover, herbs, little wood, faint barley, and faint grainy. Also quite hoppy.

As any good belbian ale should be, this one is smooth and creamy with lots of tight, tiny little bubbles.

956,"2009-09-30",4.7,"330ml bottle (approx 6.2% ABV) into signature Trappist glass. Make sure you serve it at the right temperature. Pours hazy gold-bronze with a large rocky off white head that slowly dissipates to leave a thin collar of foam that lingers to the end of the glass providing excellent lacing. There is a lot going on in the nose with Brettanomyces yeasts, bitter oranges, earthy peppery spices and floral hops. The complex taste is subtle geuze-like sour at first but  becomes sweeter on the mid palate (with a trace of oranges) and finishes with a wonderful lingering dry earthy piney hop bitterness. It is light-medium bodied with a perfect carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel that could almost be sessionable. This is easily the most idiosyncratic Belgian Trappist beer out there and I love it!

App.:  Cloudy amber with a large, loose off-white froth.

Palate:  Medium body and fairly full but rounded effervescence.
  
Flav.:  Still plenty of sour cherries, quite fruity, more malt than the nose with some caramel and toffee notes, the funk-type notes are gone, the ginger is still there with other spiciness, woody and peppery, a touch of yeast; dry with some bitterness and a little alcohol, some malt to finish.

2013 vintage was very fresh and foamy. Yeast was very well present. 2009 vintage was more matured and vinous. I guess what I would like the best would be something in between. Maybe aged 2 years would hit the spot. Lets experiment a little more...","Tampere, FINLAND","rosenbergh"

956,"2009-09-12",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 17, 2011 An exceptional, unique beer.  The beer pours a beautiful shade of burnt orange-amber, medium, with a slight haze.  The head is white and rocky and dissipates at a medium pace.  The aroma is exquisite.  The sour barnyard funk is just precisely right and blends wonderfully with the underlying Belgian ale notes.  One of my favorite aspects of Orval is the perfect dryness.  This nature even comes through in the aroma.  There are fruit notes, apricots, grapes, lemons, figs, and earthy complexity.  The flavor is just wonderful.  Im a bit of a sucker for a dry, delicious beer, and Orval pulls this off this combination better than nearly any other.  The flavor is somewhere between a gueuze and a Belgian ale.  Orval makes me imagine how good Belgian-style ales must have tasted before modernity imposed sanitary conditions and end of the sour beer as the norm.  Orval is a world classic and everyone should try it.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Appearance is a very beautiful golden with a thick head. Belgian beers always look so damn tasty and dignified.

Smells like a champagne, very fruity, grapes stand out most.

Taste is similarly fruity with a very dry finish. Again grapes and maybe a tiny hint of a citrus fruit are present. While it is very good, I would have preferred a little more definition.

Mouthfeel is high carbon and thin..a beer with this flavor would be too flat any other way.

As for drinkability, I would buy this again in a pinch if selection is limited, but would likely pass this over in most situations. Its good, but doesnt scream for me to come back to it immediately.

Taste is very dry, with citrus up front and some bready malt on the finish. Very clean. After the sip goes down the throat, you get a little oaky hop slap--very nice.

After adding the last bit of beer it turned a duller orange-amber and very cloudy. Big, rocky, foamy, two-finger width, off-white head that dissipates very slowly and leaves a soft, sticky lacing. Gorgeous and the foam never actually goes away. Aroma is pretty sharp with lots of fruits and a very nice floral hopping. TONS of fruit. Oranges, grapes, tangerines, grapefruits coated in sugar, and a touch of banana. Lots of yeast, a barnyard funk, brett, hay, and a light sour earth. Flavor isnt as brightly sweet as the aroma, but still very sweet. Lots of the same oranges and tangerines from the aroma with a bit of a sour grapefruit in there. Very yeasty with lots of funk and brett tastes. A soft floral hop throughout that isnt the easiest to pick up thanks to all the other flavors going on, but still very nice. Finishes very dry and slightly sour with a yeasty, sweet and dry citrus, sour grape, funk spicing, and noticeably bitter aftertaste that lingers for a good amount of time. Palate is light bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Overall, I have to admit, I was expecting this to be good, but figured it would be over-rated. However, I am truly impressed with how complex and unique this beer is. Lots of perfume-like aromas and flavors and a drying finish that wraps this up to perfection. Unlike anything Ive ever had.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Dry flavor, that is distinct from the smell (weird).  Hoppy, dry finish with tart overtones.    Fizzy mouthfeel, but leaves a weird aftertaste that I cant identify.

Into the glass (sadly, not a proper glass), it produced a towering fluffy white head, that after five minutes, mostly remained, nicely topping off a rich and cloudy orange body.  The aroma was quite something, with  a multitude of spices.  Taste was of course supurb, with not too much of anything.

Very bizarre mouthfeel.  There and gone in seconds.  Truly a unique beer experience.  A little clove, green apple, and a touch of citrus emerge as I continue to enjoy this fine beverage.

Very effervescent palate with coriander, clove, and floral hops up-front. The middle is dry and faintly bitter with a hop underline.

Served at the perfect temperature as opposed to the chilled examples I have been enjoying over the last few months.

At a warmer temperature the pour was still electric amber, carbonating and pffing, with a yeasty head. The smell is stupefying and almost as alive as the Rodenbach Grand Cru. The taste is sharp, and sour right to the end, with some orange citrus and a dryness that makes you beg for another. These beers are readily available in large Tesco supermarkets.

Thick murky brown/orange with a large off white cap that settles down just enough to cover the top of the beer. Whats cool is watching the carbonation hit the middle of the glass and gradually push the existing head to the sides. Some lacing later on in the beer. Interesting shadows in the beer when put up to a pot light. The aroma is just insane and very prominent. You have to be thinking ""WOW"". Its very complex with more than these qualities: fresh, very fruity with cherry (1) and plum (2) dominating, caramel, soft but eye opening spice and I swear Ive noticed chocolate - yeah, right at the end of the smell. Ill note that Ive poured this into a HUGE red wine glass (60% full), my new glass of choice for quality beers. Flavour does not dissapoint, but it doesnt live up to the aroma. Solid sweet malts, drying yeasts, slight sour raisin (I think) - a fruity sour none the less, slight spice. Theres some sediment too, not much (Im kind of suprised with that). Medium bodied. Very smooth, soft and almost too easy to consume; some carbonation. Very dry and slighty tart finish. No bitterness - long lasting aftertaste though.

956,"2009-05-25",4.8,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2009 Little vertical tasting with theisti  bottles 3,9,12 months old  3mo straight from the Abbey, 6mo from Bier temple-Bruges, and 12mo from a local store in CO. 

All 3 pour a mesmerizing orange with a big fluffy head. The appearance makes me crave the beer, prettiest brew out there. Smells of light citrus, hops and wonderful bready funk  the more age, the more complex and bready the smell (duh).  Tastes like the monks meant it to. Dry, hoppy, funky brett with some bubblegum mixed with spice and hops. I want more before Ive even finished the first swallow.  Finishes crisp and dry to complete the must have more if this vibe. 

For me  Orval just reeks of Belgium. Quintessential beer  looks, smells and tastes amazing, and its clearly alive - each one is different and every bottle opened generates the anticipation of what will be new about this one. 

------- RE-RATE FROM June, 2009 -------- a 3 year old bottle at, of all places, the Intercontinental in Hong Kong. With 3 years age on it, this is a totally different creature. All the great orval flavors are still there (tart/yeast/dryness/bitterness), but have really come together and are basically indistinguishable in and of themselves. The hop profile is, of course, well-subdued now, but theres still a nice dry bitterness to finish, and  the sour/tart yeast flavor is more of a wrapper than a distinct taste, if that makes any sense. Quite possibly the most unique brew out there and certainly at or within a slot of my personal favorite. Next stop -  a 5yo bottle...","Littleton, Colorado, USA","alagnak"

Aroma is hoppy and spicy (not in the manner of American brews though, a different character altogether), slightly sour and wild. The Brettanomyces asserts itself strongly w/ horse blanket lending this beer an aroma reminiscent of many Flemish sours. A superbly distinguished sweetness brings through complex flavors of orange, brandy, more citrus flavors and a little bread; the dryness kicks in almost immediately and it ends long, dry and mildly spicy.

956,"2009-04-25",4.5,"My bottle of Orval was bottled on 09/07/08, making her the freshest bottle of Orval I have quaffed to date. The expiration date on the bottle is 09/07/2013. When the Trappist monks themselves mark their beer 6 years into the future, then one knows they have a brewing work of art in their glass. One of 6 official Trappist breweries, Orval has been brewing their beer for centuries using the same recipe and the same tried and true yeast strains which give Orval her quintessentially enigmatic and devious nature. Devious because no two batches are ever the same, something that, when it comes to Orval, is a good thing. Without qualm, she will either scare or seduce both the newbie and the veteran.


Orval. Let the magic begin.


She poured with a billowing head of soft cream-colored foam which equaled in height the depth of her brew below. In no rush, I give her bounty a few minutes to recede before I gently poured the rest of her liquid wealth into my chalice-shaped glass. I dont have an official Orval glass yet, but I will. A splattered cotton-candy network of lace paints the sides of my glass while her soft head rests comfortably atop her kingdom. Chunks of foam drift lazily while her nose envelopes me. Orange, grapefruit, honey, apples, pears, dry sour funk, leather, and wood while ginger, nutmeg, and cumin mingle amidst the continuous onslaught of aromas. Melons and plums make themselves known as soft floral notes of lavender soothe some of the sharper edges. Eyes closed, I rest atop a cloud of pure olfactory bliss, but that is only half the joy of Orval, and so in full revelry, I savor my first quaff. Crisp, bright, and dry with an immediately drying presence of palate. Lightly bitter finish hints of grapefruit while pervading warmth is laced with dry spices, leather, and wood. Mingling throughout her palate, nips of melon, pears, apples, plums, and apricot speak of a sweeter side to Orval even as dry grass and hay join the grapefruit for a crisp finish. As she warms and I try to ignore our diminishing time together, her palate reminds me of a bountiful cornucopia of delicate sweet fruits surrounded by dry earthen aromas and flavors with just the right amount of spice and crispness leading to her finish. I cannot compare my fresh Orval to my last because it was too long ago and each Orval is different. I do know that as much as I shall enjoy a few more fresh bottles, I will definitely be setting aside a few for aging.


Orval exemplifies Belgian Trappist brewing at is enigmatic best. The monks at Orval do two things: brew beer and make cheese. There can be no more divine a marriage than beer and cheese for obvious sensory indulgent reasons. If at first Orval does not succeed for you, do not give up. The next Orval to come your way may be the one which invites your ah-ha moment of supplication.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

956,"2009-03-28",4.3,"Appearance: Right off the bat I have to say this beauty pours with about 14 fingers of massive pale white soapy looking head. Jeez Louise thats a massive stretch of foam! Additionally, it has a nice clear warm amber color. There is minimal cloudiness, and the immense amount of bubbles proves that this is a very vibrant beer.

Smell: I absolutely love the smell of Orval. There is a ton of banana bread and clove components right up front that are met up later by some funky lemon undertones. This beer really smells old world and the spices, for the most part, are very hard to pick apart. I also get a bit of alcohol presence in the nose which is odd since it only sits around 6.9% ABV.

Taste: Tastes almost identical to the smell. There is lots of banana bread in the mouth with a hint of lemon funk to back it up. Throughout the beer, several strange (yet enjoyable) floral components begin to come out. This is potentially due to the temperature change as you work through it. The lemon and funk essence that lies underneath is very reminiscent of a gueuze. In the end, you are left with a very nice deep banana taste on the tongue.

Mouthfeel: In terms of mouthfeel, this is more along the lines of how an IPA hits the palate than a Belgian style ale. It has lots of flavor and a well-rounded bitterness. There is also (as the pouring would insinuate) loads of effervescence that immediately slams into your tongue. In terms of body, this is not quite a medium-bodied beer, but close.

Overall: Of all the Trappist beers Ive had so far, this is easily one of my favorite. Im a huge fan of the whole banana bread and clove element of it. I will say its maybe a touch too ""bubbly"" for my taste, but I cant really find a whole lot more to complain about. Ill definitely be picking up some more of these down the road.","Olathe, Kansas, USA","amneziak"

----- is a re-review of a bottle of Orval that I have kept for a year (bottled at 6.2% abv). In reserve are another two bottles that I will also review at yearly intervals.
It appeared sparkling gold in colour with a voluminous white head that left good lace behind as it slowly subsided and became rocky in appearance. I found it striking that it had aromas of orange peel and zingy fruity yeasts. It smelled like an aged Appleton Estate rum along with some lemon but marginally less armpit that I was expecting. It seems to have dried and become fresher on the nose. In the mouth there was some sharpness and mandarin peel tartness. It carried very little sweetness but a good reminder of dessert fruits such as unripe apricot, green pears and mandarin.
At this age (bottled on 26-1-2012), it is clean, tart and refreshing. I look forward to this time next year.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"

Pours a slightly hazy amber color with a short lived head in my snifter, despite being pretty fizzy.  Smell is dry, dusty, funky and brett like.  Taste is similar with funky dusty yeast being the predominant flavor.  Perhaps reaching, I got a touch of fruitiness, but pretty mild, funky dry champagne like flavor, I thought.  Light to medium body and fizzy carbonation on this 2 to 3 year old bottle.   One I will definitely try again.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

956,"2009-03-12",5.0,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2010 Rating May 25, 2010: Bottled almost exactly a year ago; with a doubt, this bottle is ""on"". Man, this is wonderful. What can I say? Im reminded of my very first experience with this beer, over a year ago: Every great aspect of beer, combined in one bottle. Hoppy and malty at the same time, unique yeast character, dry and drinkable, a hint of sweet alcohol.. Nothing I would change, perfect. 

Rating Sep 30, 2009: Bottled 06/19/2008. Delicious muscat grape aroma, ripe pears and apples, an evident acidity. A filthy, rain-drenched dog lurks in the background. Looks great. The flavour is pretty sour, very spicy, herbal and medicinal. Surprisingly light unfortunately. Light alcohol presence, thoroughly mouthdrying. Its great, but not as great as I had in memory. 4.1

Rating May 26, 2009: Younger version than the previous rating, bottled october 2008. Crazy how much this improves within just a few months of age, this is seriously less appealing than the first bottle I had. Still, it is great: Decent animal-hair character and less hay in the aroma than I had in memory. The flavour is less rounded, great spicy hops and crisp bitterness though. 4.2

Rating Mar 12, 2009: Fruity, sour aroma of wine, apples and a whole lot else. Complex taste of fruits as oranges, apples and peaches, rich malt, a whole lot of herbs and spices and a hoppy finish. Creamy mouthfeel resulting from the humongous head. Really great and far too complex to explore it in 33cl. 4.6","AUSTRIA","danielst"

Première bière bue dans ce verre: une Orval (29/05/2008) qui avait passé 6 mois dans ma grandiose cave à bière (un rustique dsous descalier).  Javais déjà été déçu par cette bière, mais probablement par ma faute, layant servi trop froide.  Les arômes sont très marqués, peut-être à cause du verre ou de leffet psychologique dont je je suis peut-être victime.  Bière au goût probablement unique, qui dévoile vraiment ses subtilités fruitées, légèrement sucrées et citronnées bue à 12-14 degré tel que recommandé.  Au moins, cette délicieuse bière belge est disponible au Québec...  ENGLISH:  Most enjoyable if you respect the serving temperature indicated (12-14 Celcius, something like 50-55 farenheit).  Amazing and unique taste, blend of subtle spices, with lemon, slightly sugary although quite bitter.  This bottle had only 10 months aging and seemed already somewhat sweeter.

956,"2009-01-08",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2011 [330ml bottle at The Retreat, Reading on 7/1/2009] Served unaged in correct branded glass, which my friends said looked like the Holy Grail! Pours a cloudy gold with a very large white head.  Was immediately struck by the fabulous carbonation.  Im normally no fan of fizzy beers, but the soft, tiny bubbles in this beer gently caress your tongue, leaving a tempting tingle that you immediately want more of.  The dominant flavour is lemon/citrus, with some pine notes and a little cinnamon.  Theres a pineapple sweetness in the background, although the sweetness is thankfully lower than in other Belgian beers.  The finish is dry, although not as dry as I was expecting based on other comments on this database.  In fact, this is a very well balanced beer.  But its the beautiful mouthfeel from the unusual carbonation that Ill remember. [Re-rate, 4/3/2011, 2 year old bottle that Jim gave me] Having seen all the hoo-haa about aging this beer, I thought Id give it a go.  After two years plus, the fizz has died down a bit, to leave a beer that is very very dry indeed.  Lemon is still the main flavour, but theres banana making an appearance in the background, along with a hint of spice.  I personally felt that tasted fresh the beer was much more joyful and full of life than when aged - I dont think that aging has done anything for it.  Ive left my rating as for the fresh beer, because that for me was how its meant to be, and how its best drunk!  Controversial, I know...","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","wheresthepath"

Comment une compagnie peuvent brassé qu’une seul bière et en même temps en brassé des différence aussi marqué de brassin en brassin. De couleur ambre orangé, bonne mousse, peu de carbonation avec léger dépôt de levure. Une odeur ennivrante de sapin, d’épinette, d’houblon, de pelure d’orange et de levure. Une fois réchauffé, l’orval dévoile un petit côté caché, une senteur de banane suivis d’un peu de gingembre.

I was not rating on this site at that time so my previous rating on the old scale was three stars out of five and I had no notes.  Orval pours a little darker than grapefruit juice with a medium-sized head that leaves curtain-like lacing on the glass.  The aroma was full of citrus, light vinegar and quite floral.  The initial taste is pretty tart.  The hops do not mix in very smoothly with the overall character of the beer.  There is a strong gueuze flavor (brett) to this beer.

Bottle brown, 330 ml,
Appearance pours beutifully orangy brown, oily, honey like, very lively and hazy to murky body with intensive and lively natural saturation, head is pillowy, frothy to creamy, milky white with nice, thick lacing, initially big in size, slowly decreasing to medium, later on lasting for a long time, very stable, firm, compact,
Aroma I woul say that this beer apart from being a Belgian Ale has a class and style of its own, front is high hoppy denoting herbal accents mixed with marvellous citrusy scent of orange, clementine, lime, lemon, white wine grapes, gerrn olives, pineapple, grapefruit, fig, resin, wildberry, strawberry, blackberry, juniper berries, touches of pineapple wood, additionally very soft, sweet, perfume like hoppyness, very complez and highly aromatic beer denoting also notes of wheat , candid sugar but on the other hand suggesting mature dry taste,
Flavour front is quite light but at the very beginning it becomes only more and more bitter on palate, when you enjoy it the bitterness becomes so strong and essential like yellow bile, it has a wonderful explosion of forest and citrusy fruits in nose, very dry and focused sharp bitterness reminds something more bitter than bare cacao, flavour represents the same fruity, hoppy, flowery, aromatic profile as the aroma, the taste is very complex but original and perfectly combined in a monolith, finish duration is long and pleasant with toastyness and wood,
Palate body is medium, texture is dry, carbonation on palate is soft to medium, finish feel is highly astringent, very clean and slightly chalky and despite it alcohol content it is practicly not felt,

Aromas mostly of earthy malt and yeast with hints of brown sugar, chocolate and leather. 
Bizarre flavours. Rather sour, initially, then becomes bitter and slightly watery. Very dry, almost to the point of acidity. Behind the hops and malt are complex ""peppery"" flavours, but the only fruit I detected was some slight raisin and black grape. 
Gassy, yet creamy mouthfeel with a dry, bitter finish. A good beer, but I cannot help but feel it is overrated simply because it is a Trappist product.","Dunedin, NEW ZEALAND","sdriessen"

956,"2008-11-01",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 31, 2011 330mL bowling pin. Pours unlike any other beer I can remember: very hazy bright orange with a dense, fluffy, off-white head. Aroma is very spicy, hoppy, citrusy. Lots of orange peel, lemon, cinnamon, peach as well. Flavor is very different. Lots of spice but more of a ginger bite than cinnamon and cloves found in other Trappists. Incredibly dry, spicy finish. Perfectly neutral on the palate. Overall perfectly balanced and a new take on the Belgian Trappist ale. This is top of the line- an instant classic. 11/1/2008 8/4/8/5/18=4.3330mL bowling pin consumed a year and two months after bottling (brewed in April 2010). The pour on this beer is perfect. 5/5 with no question. A heavy and spritzy glowing orange is topped by a whipped cream, off-white head, with ridiculous rocky retention and huge lace. The nose on this beer is insane- almost geuze like in power and complexity. Heavy funk and moldy peel combine with fresh Brett and spices to create an overwhelming nose that could be described as ""Christmas geuze"" or cinnamon geuze. Cloves and cinnamon from a Trappist base beer combine with a Brett medley and other wild characters (gives off some acetic funk) to create a unique nose I have not encountered in any other beer.  Taste is fresh, floral ginger and cinnamon heavy with a spritzy and fresh palate that still has a little body and sugar left. Finish gets a little chalky and dry and lacks that final piece of the puzzle that sour beers have- a big palate. Orval is not sour by any means but fresh and funky and Brett forward.

956,"2008-10-20",4.6,"Bottle dated Sep 13 2007. Poured into a Chimay goblet (closest thing I have to an Orval goblet). Pumpkin pie color with a light tan head that foams up to two fingers’ height and manages to maintain itself at a solid half centimeter for most of the duration of the beer. Huge chunky lacing.

Tart bretty nose, almost like an unblended lambic but not as sour. Some distinct phenolic notes with a touch of golden apple and banana. Sort of somewhere between saison, geuze, and tripel. As it breathes it takes on a more sweet and floral character. Wonderful.

Flavor is lightly fruity with unripe pears. Lots of spices, white pepper, orange peel. Funky grassy brett influence. Dry bitter noble hop finish.

Body is a bit chalky (I poured the yeast in) and medium in viscosity. Highly carbonated but somehow it isn’t distracting like in some Belgians.

Re-Rate: Figured Id join in the Orval appreciation day to revisit this Trappist beer with a great story. Bottled on 07/03/2007. Aroma is very funky, the brett has defiantly funkified this bottle... in a good way. Mandarin oranges, spice, yeast, sour soother candy, cherry blasters, and a touch of alcohol come out on the nose. The taste is so unique, it could only be Orval. Oranges, sour candy, medicinal tastes, lemon, some indescribable acidity (probably from the brett), spice, and a dry finish. Palate is just like every excellent Belgian, soft and lively. This beer scores more points now, just because of weirdness factor. I see why my original ratings were lower... But I have to bump them a touch.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","hobbersr"

Aroma is citrusy, sour, bretty, light white grape skin, some orange peel and the lightest of spice.  Flavor is lighter than the aroma lets on; many familiar notes from the aroma, but with a bit less intensity, followed by a dry finish.

Very hazy honey brown color with a huge white head.that holds (1/8th inch head lasts the whole beer) and laces well.  Honey, wheat, clove, orange peal, lemon, typical belgian aroma.  Flavors are pretty much the same but with some yeast notes, very light and refreshing, though not as outstanding as the hype.  A little bit of sourness and acidity on the finish, but still shortlived and somewhat dry.  It is light on the palate and not overly carbonated as many belgians are.  Really drinkable.  Overall: good, but not that unique and not as good as the half filled (probably oxidized and definitely more sour) version that I had the first time I bought a bottle,


[RERATE] Had a 2 year old bottle from 2006 last night.  It was much improved thanks to the brett.  But, it was still not amazing.  If I wasnt digging deep and focusing very hard on what I was tasting, it would have been an average beer experience.

(RE-RATE) Year old bottle. Into Chimay Trappist glass. Head is REDICULOUS. Bottle didnt gush, but it was impossible to pour this in one pour - i.e. the head rises to fast, at an absurd rate.  Clear amber orange-ish body with lots of fast-rising carbonation and a huge white sea-foamy head that leaves laces (leaving the appearance at 4... could be 5 if the head wasnt so out of control). Aroma is nice (bumped from 7 to 8) - yeasty, citrus, a bit sour, and very inviting. Flavor I will leave at 7.  It tastes good with a nice dry tartness that leaves the mouth dry on the finish.  Though I love this quality, it seems to override any real flavor. I;m getting a bit of citrus and booze, but mostly an amorphous dry tartness.  Palate, I want to lower from 3 to 2 because it is just soo carbonated it is ridiculous. This too subtracts from the flavor because it is so destracting to my palate.  Despite how mcuh I hate overly carbonated beers, I am leaving the palate score at 3 because it is on style as far as I have experienced.  Overall, up from 14 to 15 -- I am gonna try my best to swirl the carbonation out of this!!","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

The brewery become industrial, clearly, they have built many cylindro-conic fermentation tanks, that replace old swimming-pool like ones.

When I drinked it the last week, I found some banana flavors from yeasts, but not clear enough. The yeasts flavors aren’t complex, unlike the old Orval version that I tasted ten years ago.

When we drink it we clearly feel hop extracts (hop perfume extracts and hop bitterness extracts). These extracts tastes are strong and ruin the overall taste... almost fortunately, because of the fermentation that isn’t able to make complex flavors.

A good beer that I advice to learn someone what hop extracts are, but not a good beer to drink.

Very strong aroma - wonderfully aromatic - surprising amounts of hops for a Belgian, but balanced by plenty of malts and orange / grapefruit citrus. It’s a bit tart on the nose. Carbonation is strong, biting into your palate right away, giving way to bitter citrus and a very dry finish with plenty of hops. Very good, and certainly refined - would be fantastic after a few years in the cellar. The carbonation is just a bit too strong, and the palate could use a little bit of mellowing.

Never the same, but always spectacular, I find that of my choices of perfection, an Orval that provides a nice Brett sourness is my favorite, but the others are still so enjoyable if it was required to pick a single beer for the rest of my life, the variety available in this beer would make it a simple choice.","Capital of Appalachia, Pennsylvania, USA","lithy"

Aroma of yeast, cantelope, sour apples, citrus, bananas- just take a bunch of random fruit and mix in a blender- all very appealing.

I cannot say the aroma was anything like I was expecting, olives, grapes, melon fruit, and some other kind of spice, very very interesting and unique though Im not sure Im completely turned on by it.  The appearance on the other hand wow! Absolutely beautiful pour, huge cream colored pillowy bubbly head, stays nicely, minor lacing, great cloudy burnt orange color, very little carbonation bubbles.  This is definitely the most unique tasting beer I may have ever tried, for starters the palate is fantastic, super smooth, medium mouthfeel feels great on the tongue and palate, it has a spicy exotic fruit start initially, then I get similarly to the aroma olives/grape malt flavors, finishes with a very dry unique type of bitter.

The way the brett works on this is fantastic, In my experience a few years does not hurt this beer, it changes it but it does not hurt it. The aroma particularly complex with scents of white wine, flowers, citrus, cork, and just a shade of funk. It genuinely smells beautiful. The beer is cloudy with floaties, a pale to orange colored beer with a large head that leaves a good lace. The taste I can liken to champagne, with some nice citrus notes, I know that when fresh this beer is quite hoppy, over time the beer retains bitterness, however most of the hop flavor is gone now. The beer is has a nice funky flavor with some good spicy alcohol notes. The palate is somewhat sharp, and it is not particularly smooth, but not all beers should be. Indeed a personal favorite of mine. I need to avg this with a fresh bottle rating.... soon hopefully.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

The aroma is of orange peel, lemon, and candy sweetness.  I really enjoyed the crispness of Orvals flavor:  a surprisingly well blended concoction of citrus fruit (orange, lemon), sugar, and some malty sweetness.  Great aftertaste of fruit and slight bitterness.
Update 11/09:  taste the brett a lot more this time around, accompanied with lemony spritziness and light toasted toffee.  Almost a saltine cracker, maybe even fresh cracked peppercorn components as well.  Fascinating brew to drink, Saison complexity, layered atop a perfectly noble Belgian Ale.  If anything, the prickly mouthfeel is so intense that it hampers drinkability.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

At first sip, I thought it was candy, it had a nice, sweet, fruity presence.  Then as I settled into the beer the hop bitterness and yeast spiciness began to shine through.

There is a solid alcohol presence but it is not overwhelming.  I found that after one beer I did not feel it all that much as I do with some of the stronger Belgians.

I thought this beer was a lot like Duvel, although without the same hop presence that Duvel has.  The yeast character was very simlar in both beers.","Columbia, Pennsylvania, USA","machfive55"

956,"2008-05-03",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 24, 2008 color was very surprising based upon initial aroma gathered from the bottle, before the pour. one of the hoppiest trappists, thats for sure. some orange and musty animals in the nose which translates well to the pallete. aftertaste falls off a cliff at 80 mph, dry finish is severe and enjoyable.  palate character has elements of cider possibly: dry, muted/darkened fruit...all articulated to varying extents into the flavor.  

i remember many years ago when sam adams was the hoppiest beer i had ever had. at the time (pre 21) i didnt understand that that pine tree taste was hops, and now when im trying to expalin hops to someone that doesnt understand i use that beer as an example. well orval is one of the most perfect examples of brettanomyces. if you are unclear on what that means, drink an orval. you wont be disappointed","River Grove, Illinois, USA","satan165"
956,"2008-05-03",1.0,"33cl bottle courtesy of Harrisoni.  This is awful. A kind of cloudy orange-brown colour with the smell of a lemon toilet cleaner.

Aroma is very fruity, hints of hoppiness that arent evident in many other Belgian Ales.  A nice twist.  I agree with everyone whos noted the power of the aroma.  People at the other end of my table stopped talking to comment on it!  The flavor is slightly dry acidic, but the yeasts make  play, as does the citrus arena.  A little spice hangs around at the end, and the overall feeling in the mouth is a little strong.  As others have noted, the flavors change as the beer warms.  In my case, I sensed less of the citrus and more of the yeastiness, hop dryness, and spicy malty.

956,"2008-04-15",3.7,"...well, I have to say, this is one of the most complex, as well as expensive ales out there.  It is thick, very aromatic from the dry hopping, and also has a nice finish.

The head leaves a thick lacing that follows the beer only part way down the glass. The light nose of the beer smells of sweet fruit with a trace of yeast. The beer is light a bubbly on your tongue almost dancing as it slides down your throat. The sharp bite of the carbonation and alcohol almost over powers the light taste of malt and yeast. The beer finishes with a quick yet sharp carbonation inspired fruitiness.","Sugarland, Texas, USA","texasbartender"

Unique and complex, refreshing and effervescent. Medium body and a smooth mouth feel. Tart dry finish that leaves you wanting more.

Sweet yeasty aroma typical of the style, although perhaps not as strong as some.  Nice fruity taste, although not as sweet as the aroma would have indicated.  A hint of nutmeg flavor.

The yeast is interesting and produces some subtle fruity flavors, pears and stale citrus. The head is huge and the carbonation is heavy making it a faster drink than most of its style.

Nose is probably the most disappointing part, fairly subdued at a slightly chilled temperature (which I feel the rest of the beer is best at).  That said, I did find some yeast, and lemon drop.  Some bitter fruit, lemon, lime, nutmeg, cinnamon.  The mouthfeel is the best part, with some serious acidity and dry finish along with ridiculous carbonation makes this fairly unique.  Coats the palate and results in a very long finish.  An excellent and unique beer.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","dmtroyer"

Delicate perfume aroma of orange, citrus, spices, bread and horseblanket notes. The flavour is intriguingly complex and almost appears to take on a different character each mouthful. A little tart. Dry and bitter finish. Damn the bottles finished already. A true Belgian Ale. Edit: Ive gone back to Orval on many an occasion and every time is something new and exciting. I personally enjoy around the 2 year age mark when the brett has made its mark and its a superb balance between funk, fruit and spice. Its just a really fun beer.

After it warmed a bit (I think it was served too cold), the fruit flavors came out and it became more enjoyable.

Shows you right away that this is not really a Belgian Strong, but more aptly described as a Belgian Ale.  Fluffy white head looks gorgeous in the glass.  Aroma is a lighter sweet fruit and malt.  The citrus aroma is of mild hoppiness, but very different than the rich hops aroma that youd get from a lager.  It is crisp and clean on the palate - dominant flavors are fresh light fruits.

Aroma is absolutely stunning - bursting fruity hops dominate, along with apricot, sour cherry, raspberry, plum, peach - all sorts of really fresh light fruit.  The hopping almost seems similar to some American West Coast IPAs.  Fantastic.  Flavour is a notch lower than the aroma, but still very good.  More of the fruit flavours coming through, but with a very dry quality to the brew, and a mild bitter finish.  There is also a sort of barnyardy/meadowy quality at the back of the palate that lasts forever.

It was to bitter for me. I even thought it was rancid. After many years Ill had another try. even then it wasnt not my taste. So for about 2 years ago, Ill treid it a third time. I started to like it. For now I like this dark orange clear colored beer very much. It has a large light beige foamy head. It has an aroma of grapes, citrus, an also very hoppy.

956,"2008-03-02",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 18, 2011 330ml bottle from the LCBO. Pours a hazy light brown, with a large white head. Aroma: Loads of hops, very dry, spicy, some cinnamon, yeast. Taste: Wow, now thats different. Very complex, starts out a little sweet with all of the above mentioned aspects, but becomes intensely dry and bizarre. Lots of complex fruity esters in the finish and aftertaste. The dryness is so strong this brew virtually vanishes from your tongue. Very rough mouth-feel initially, makes way for the desert. Banana, apple, cinnamon, apple crisp, yeast, its hard to fully describe. It is what it is. Lingering bitterness turns into mild sweetness, apple pie like. Sourness becomes more evident as it goes along, which is the only thing really holding me back from liking this one a lot, as I have issues with sour ales. Will age and revisit. There may be just a bit too much hype around this one. NEW RATING: Ive got more used to the characters in this beer and can really appreciate it a lot more now. I love the Bretty dryness, very puckering and sour yet with some decent malt body behind it. Hoppy to the max which I also love.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

956,"2008-03-01",4.9,"UPDATED: JAN 6, 2013 Sweet distracting vanilla candy fragrance. Big head, very appealing head, visually stimulating when you look closely.  I hate to focus on the head but it goes rocky after a few minutes and it then gets darkly dotted stained from the drippings off the bottom of the bottle.  Perfect carbonation greets the palate and you can see it constantly rolling in the brew, quite entertaining. Very nice balance of hops and malt land on the taste buds. Not over  the top except for the level of enjoyability. In my humble opinion, this is a fine example of what beer should be. Friendly in every respect. Exquisitely beauteous. This could be the perfect session brew if it wasnt for the mild bitter linger, which may I say is quite humble!","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

Appearance: Pours an orange-amber body with a tall, foamy white head.

Smell: Complex aroma filled with notes of citrus, pears, apple cores, gentian, sauvignon blanc, and a second-hand horseblanket store.

Taste: Flavors of unripened pears, piced citrus, and bitter herbs. Dash of white wine. Sour and funky throughout. Hops come through now and again amongst all the various tastes. Finishes peppery and exceedingly dry. Lingering tongue-numbing sourness in the aftertaste.

956,"2008-02-24",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 19, 2008 Initial review, 2-24-08: 330 ml bottle. Bottled on 1-24-2006. Poured into a Corsendonk tulip glass. Wonderful, complex, floral, zesty, farmhouse ale-like aroma. Sour apple, cider, honey, candy sugar, salt, and lemon scents. The smell is subtle, and it could stand to be stronger. Pours a hazy brass to light copper. An enormous quantity of tiny bubbles furiously gushes to the surface from the center of the glass in a champagne-like fashion. The effervescence lasts for a long time. Large amount of thick, uneven, long-lasting, cream-colored head that looks like whipped cream. Orval looks amazing! This is one of the best appearances on which I have ever laid eyes. Produces long-lasting, thick, extensive lacing. Complex, subtle, dry taste. Pear, milk, lemon-flavored carbonated water, apple, and champagne flavors. Dirt-hops dryness in the start and finish. There is an additional, great component to the finish on which I cant put my finger. That description fails to do the flavor justice. The taste is simply Orval. The taste is so complex as to be almost indescribable. I wish the flavors were stronger, because they are excellent. Long, parchingly dry aftertaste. Medium to full body. Fluffy, creamy, and lively in the palate. The liquid expands to fill the mouth. Awesome, unique texture. Easy to drink and refreshing. Orval is one of the best looking and feeling (in the palate) beers Ive ever tried. I would give the appearance and palate 6s if I could. The very good smell and taste are merely nice bonuses. Orval truly is one of the best beers in the world. Having had one bottle, I can tell that this is the kind of beer that will produce different sensations and insights upon each tasting. It has something for the fan of almost any type of beer. If I could drink only one beer for the rest of my life, I might have to choose this one! 8/5/8/5/18  4.4

<P>Supplemental review, 4-19-08: Roughly 3 oz. pour from an 11.2 oz. bottle, consumed at a beer tasting on 4-12-08. Bottled on 9-13-07. Spicy aroma features clove, coriander, rotten apple, cinnamon, and apple cider scents. Pours a very hazy orange / amber. Effervescent. Large amount of uneven, off-white head. Produces thick lacing. Subtle taste. Farmhouse flavors. Dull sweetness. Light to medium body. While still quite good, this bottle of Orval didnt blow me away like the first one I rated did. Ill keep the original rating as the official one, but if I were to rate this one, it would be as follows: 9/5/7/4/15  4.0","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
956,"2008-02-24",2.4,"Bottle. Hazy orange with fizzy head. Aroma is pungently hoppy with some metallic tinge. Flavor similar, overwhelmingly bitter and hoppy, but not at all like an IPA. Somewhat like a very bitter version of a Witbier. No noticeable malt to speak of. Plenty of carbonation. I didnt care for this beer much at all, despite its monastic origin. Had a hard time finishing it. Very different from the other dubbel/tripel types of Belgian Ales that Im more familiar with, but I think Orval fits the description given by the brewers and is probably good for those who like this style, just not for me.","Houston, Texas, USA","DrZao"
956,"2008-02-23",3.9,"one year after bottling date.  pours brown-orange with a porous white head.  intense carbonation breaks head into cobwebs.  musty, slightly fruity smell.  taste is dry as a bone and tart with bitter edge.  apple and pear notes comes through as it warms, but they are subtle - the dry, bitter qualities are dominant.  a great beer that was a treat to drink, but there are other belgian style brews that are less expensive and comparable in taste.","Alabama, USA","tagz"

The flavors start out with a bit of bitterness up front, quickly followed by a distinct funky flavor... but where is the sour grape detected in the nose.

956,"2008-02-16",4.8,"Ive waited for such a long time before rating this beer, for I felt my description would not do it justice. With humility, here goes: hazy copper, pouring the beer in its own chalice forms a 2 inch lasting compact foam; the carbonation is high while being controlled. The nose is fruity (lemon), a touch flowery (rose), peppery, a bit funky, yeasty and perhaps there is a touch of green olives pits. The complexity of its aroma is astonishing and appetizing à souhait! As for the flavor, I cannot think of any beer featuring a better balance, tart enough to make it mouthwatering, hops being one of its numerous attributes, superb complexity in its bitterness while  it is never overwhelming and finishes dry. Actually, the lenght is so good you wonder if itll ever ends. As for the palate, silky smooth. This is the one and only beer that grows on me: every time I have one, the pleasure I have keeps increasing. My one and only complaint may be its glass: while it is indeed beautifull, I hardly ever manage not to spill some of this gold liquid for the glass is so wide. I cannot think of any other beers that features such complexity and drinkability. If you find it too bitter, you may lay it down for about 2-3 years, it mellows a lot.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbiere"

Flavor follows exactly, quite dry, very spicy, lots of brett with minimal metallic notes, seemingly woody, finishing with a touch of bright fruit, cant wait to do the R&D side by side.   Medium bodied, a bit watery, larger carbonation with a light crispness.  Finishes dry with a bit of alcohol. Classic.  8.5.8.4.17","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

It has an orange peachy cloudy colour. Strong creamy head, that leaves a great lace. Aroma is very acid, spicy, oranges, apples and leather or horseblanket. Strong body and heavy sour flavor. Taste is very acid, cloves, orange, apples, spicy, dry and again the leather or horseblanket.

The alcohol is not very much, so its a very good beer to drink with your dinner.

956,"2008-01-05",4.1,"I really cant believe Im decimating as many of my cellared Trappists in one night, but I figure its a mini-flight that was originally scheduled for New years but delayed a couple days. On the nose... this was close to perfect. I cant describe properly the flower and apple on the nose... just a perfect balance... attractive like a beautiful woman... urging you to ask her something. I dont get the hops, mainly because  I served it colder than optimal. The yeasts are very pleasant and mild but the bitterness just balances the fizz on the head (which was about 1-1.5 inches when poured). It was perfectly dry given all the other characteristics. It left a nice lacing of alcohol on the lips.. almost buttery, but not on the tongue. Im not sure where or how to say how good this was, but out of the Trappists I have had, outside of the Chimay White, this was one of the best Belgian ales Ive ever had. Id get a case of this if I could do so easily. Little hints of a pepper spice on the tongue, still trying to figure out what else, but possibly the burn of a cinnamon. Bottle from 2005.

Flavor-wise, very menthol and numbing.  Very strange.  I think my extensive experience with dentists makes this appealing.  Hoppy, slightly numbing, solid.

Also reminded me very much of those chewy, sugary candies that are supposed to look like wedges of fruit...the watermelon flavor has a pink rind with a solid green half circle...cant think of the name...anyway, suffice it to say it was pretty sugary, but good, natural cane sugar.

956,"2008-01-03",4.0,"Bottled on 03/15/07, 6.9% abv, barely chilled. Cloudy amber liquid forms a roiling cauliflower froth alive with bubbles, the beer maintains a durable, steady head. Unique, complex brett bouquet boasts muddled lemon, peach and apricot, buttery white stilton, horse sweat and leather tack, fresh hay, and mellow musty/musky/smoky notes. Leading minerally, tart apple, and galangal introduce latent flavors that include sweet cherry, bubblegum, muscat, and lime zest. Wafts of wildflower and nutmeg spice caress the sinuses. Despite its lightness, the mouthfeel is not watery it is instead feathery and soft as cotton balls. The dry, dry finish glides into a wondrous aftertaste, freckled with bitter licorice and eucalyptus, grapefruit pith, strawberry, and barest brassy lemonade tartness. Tongue-tickling, playful, and (nudge nudge wink wink) subtley erotic.","New Mexico, USA","maltdog"

There is sourness, barnyard, yeast, hops and a lot of other things. The sourness numbs my tongue, but after a while it dares to relax just a little bit and I get notes of a well prepared and slightly warm dough. The beer is 5 months old.

956,"2007-12-11",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2013 Bottle 33cl.
Pours an amberish copperish beer with a mostly diminishing head which has the shape of a snowy mountain.
The foam on this beer is incredible. Its shiny and perfumed, like a dusty attic and its bitter like poison. The yeast on the bottom adds an earthy and doughy character. 
Smell of herbs, spices and lemony grass. A unique dry-hopped perfume.
Get your nose into this Orval and sniff its foam as long as it lasts.
It has a well carbonated palate, providing a lively mouthfeel.
Aromas of lemon honey, spices, bread, dough, grapefruit and certainly orange peel. The use of brett adds a barnyard sour character but not in such a way that dislikers of sour will hate this Orval. Well, for one I dont.
Very light and drinkable, aftertaste is bitter and very dry. It lingers for a long time. Flavour is all but sweet in perfect harmony. 
There doesnt seem to be an in between with this unique brew, either you like it and wholeheartedly appreciate it, or you move on and forget about it. 
The second group please give this beer another chance and keep in mind the low ABV this one comes with.

956,"2007-12-03",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2011 Intriguing and exciting granny smith apple nose.  Orange, waves of red.  Vibrant white head falls quickly but never really goes away and leaves patchy lacing.  Unique, quickly tart and sharply dry.  Theres a consistent and mild cherry sweetness that persists and adds an extra layer.***one year old bottle.  Quite an audible pfff and a strong tall lively head.  Had to wait for it to die down and type this before I finished pouring the bottle.  Rocky uneven head.  Im really liking the Brett here, strong and dry, bitter aroma like biting into a banana peel.  OK this head is so creamy and dense, so picturesque with visible waves that this is becoming the best Orval Ive had.  More horse blanket aroma.  Lemon peel and cotton, herbal throughout, dry floral hop finish.  The Brett is quite a mouthful here and overtakes any other subtle magic.  The finish becomes more juicy with each sip, but the dryness is by far the center of attention.*** 092310  2 year old bottle, strong effervescent, pop, creamy head pours well above the rim of the glass, perfection.

956,"2007-11-24",4.9,"Bottle. Pours hazy woody amber with a thick fluffy off-white head. Neat lacing patterns. Bubbles rising from the bottom of the tulip glass. Aroma is white wine viniousness upfront, with medicinal herbs, spiciness and solid, barnyard earthiness in the background. The beer is slightly sour, slightly dry, a nice rush of fragrant hop resins on the palate - some tart citrus fruit -  and mild cookie dough maltiness throughout. Some soapy and floral hop flavors and musty basement flavors as it warms. Lightly floral bitterness lingers long on in the finish like flower pollen. Also  the shadow of the flavors of the malt and yeast are present in the mouth long after a sip. I wish I could drink nothing but this magnificent beer my entire life.","San Francisco, California, USA","asedzie"
956,"2007-11-24",3.6,"Bottle best before March 15, 2012.  This stuff is semi- cloudy and fluid with a tall, symmetrical white head on top. It really is a spectacle: the body is fairly translucent through the haze and I can see vigorous carbonation rising to the dense, opaque white head. I took a sniff quickly after the pour out of habit and was greeted with a gritty, almost skunky aroma to my dismay. But now, after a minute or so of zoning out  while I stare at it in the snifter, I cant smell anything offensive. Its tart and wild with a bit of Balsamic vinegar but balanced with cloves, apples, bananas, and herbal scents. hm. The flavor is different than I was led to believe. The mouthfeel is spritzy and a little thin. Sweet fruits are up front and a dry, hoppy, tart finish balances things out. Assertive papery, lemony hops peek out from the fruity, flowery flavor. It seems to meld in the flavor too after a few sips. I get more green apples now in the taste. This is quite a strange beer, definitely a departure from the traditional Trappist styles. Ive heard so many opinions regarding the variance in Orval. Ill have to revisit some different batches and see what I think.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

956,"2007-11-13",3.5,"Never heard of a trappist ale before  this one.  Tastes like a drier, fruitier version of a lager.  The color and aroma were unbelieveable, but the carbination and bite got to me after a while.  Almost tasted like a dry chardonnay.","California, USA","timfoolery"

956,"2007-11-13",3.9,"Pours a beautiful reddish brown, cloudy with a good white and inviting head.  Aroma of cinnamon, fruits, yeast and alchohol.  An excellent blend of scents better than any aroma therapy candle.  The first sip, the carbonation hits the tongue with gusto, making the center of the tongue tingle.  An otherwise excellent mouthfeel is a bit overdone by the carbonation.  But not so much that it cannot be enjoyed.  The taste was light, hoppy, and a blending of the aromas.  The finish is crisp and dry.  This is by far a very good beer, but not the best trappist I have tried.","Watertown, Wisconsin, USA","ubamartian"
956,"2007-11-13",4.4,"Where Do I begin? Of the 6 trappist beers I had, this one was my favorite. It may be the furthest thing from the traditional Trappist, however it is a gem. It pours a cloudy orange/reddish tinted color with a nice white head. the aroma is one to be compared to a cocktail of wonderful scents. Lemons, citrus, cinnamon, melons, bananas, and BEER. The taste was light and crisp and hoppy. It was quite carbonated and refreshing. Had a great finish and nice light lingering bitter aftertaste. It was truly ideal.

Nice white head.  Smell was big and enticing, promising something nice.  Had to switch my glass on first taste, realizing the almost champagne like carbonation.

On the nose is a nice sour brett with a solid citric backing and just the faintest note of candy sugar; not as complex as Id anticipated but quite nice. Light-bodied with soft carbonation and a lightly sour and dry finish. The flavor is a bright yeasty citrus with tongue-squeezing sourness at a mildly dry finish. A very satisfying and tasty brew.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"
956,"2007-10-30",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 27, 2013 27/10 0.33 l bottle at Hopdevil. Since I first tried Leffe blond, I fell in love with Belgian ales generally so came with big expectations to this reputable one as well! Its beautiful bottle poured murky golden to amber body with quite big ivory creamy head that went away at medium pace. Nice fruity aroma of banana with citrus hops... typical Belgian ale things. Flavor is quite light and watery, but with lot of subtle flavors in there, starting from apples, peaches to some dark fruits. Finish is short, very simple and although rounding this nice beer, really leaves you disappointed. I had much better Belgian ales for sure.It was really fresh, maybe allowing it to re-ferment in bottle for more time would be a viable option here.","Split, CROATIA","heavy"

956,"2007-10-22",4.2,"Bière cuivrée avec une fantastique mousse blonde, abondante et persistante. Il y a un léger voile.
Le parfum est très floral, il rappel le sous-bois une journée fraîche après la pluie. Notes de conifère, de mousse, décorce de bouleau et même de champignons. Le goût est astringeant, avec des notes dalcool bien senties. On retrouve à nouveau la forêt. Elle flirte avec des notes terreuses ou de cuir. Sans y tomber toutefois.

956,"2007-10-19",3.6,"Aroma consisting of citrus and spice.  Head was tall and loose. Color, held to the light, was marbled and opaque.  Initial Flavors were smooth with a misleading bitter tail which was followed by a mild and surprisingly smooth mediocre complexity.","Miami, Florida, USA","uoffgator"
956,"2007-10-19",4.4,"I have been having this running conversation with a co-worker about  the ""This is Spinal Tap"" movie and all of the fantastic little facts that come to light about it.   The one statement that has become apparent is ""Does Tap imitate life or life imitate Tap?""  It is my firm belief that all other Belgian ales imitate Orval.  This was bottled on July 5th of this year, and boasts 6.9% hidden well on the label.
The pour results in a semi-hazy rust tinged amber.  Upon it sits a bright fluffy white head that leaves stained glass like lacing on the tulip glass as it rockily reduces itself to a quarter inch steady head. (ours go to eleven)  Nose is gently spicy and lasting about the glass.  Orange peel, yeast, rose hips and pepper blend well and transition from the nose to the slightly bitter body (this is an exact copy of my inner structure)  Incredibly mellow and balanced (id work in a habadashery, yeah!).

956,"2007-10-16",4.0,"$5.49 bottle from Holiday Wine Cellar.  Bottled on 11/11/2006.  1 yr old.  Big 2 finger off-white head starts with small bubbles clinging to the glass for dear life, and after 10 minutes of waiting for the head to settle, an awesome 3mm microbubble foam is left with remnants of the original head still clinging in place on the side of the glass.  The aroma, Im told, is classic Brett finishing.  Ive smelled this many times before, originally thinking it was a flaw, it was plasticy, it was phenolic from using chlorinated water for the mash, but now I know better.  The nose/brain often interprets the same smell as pleasant or unpleasant depending on the experience and knowledge of the smell.  As such, a new car smell is not the best smell for a beer, as hops is not the best smell for a car (except to me).  Maybe a bit of lemon and green apples  in the aroma.  I cautiously give the aroma an 8.  The amber color is clear, but leans slighty cloudy.  I reluctantly give the appearance a 5, but that head is just so beautiful.  Taste is certainly dry and a little tart.  A little bit of tannin/hop bitterness finishes on the back of the tongue.  Though not my favorite style, it is a wonderfully refreshing alternative to the onslaught of sweet imperial stouts and nose pounding IPAs, both of which I love by the way.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"

Thin body, good carbonation, quite wet.  Taste hugely of pepper with some apple (minus the sweetness).  Finishes with a lemon zest, almost tinny but still good.  Just a bit bitter, enough to add some depth and something to remember.  Too dry for my tastes, but I still deeply enjoyed it.  Savored to the last drop.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","jlf278"

956,"2007-10-14",4.5,"100th rating! Thought Id break something out of the cellar for the occasion.  33cl bottle dated June 06, marked 6.7 ABV. Cap about blew off and as I pour I can see why: a gentle pour creates a luscious souffle of mother-of-pearl froth which forms rocky peaks as it gradually dissipates.  Glaciers of frost hang to the trappist glass edges. From above, the beer appears a copper bronze, but held to the light it becomes a delectable golden amber.  A quick whiff draws images of lemongrass, orange peel, cotton candy, horse leather, treacle; really the aroma is spectacular, to put it bluntly.  One of the smoothest beers Ive had in a long while, with a massive body and velvety texture.  Has a slight gueuze like quality to its tart finish, but the grassy minty hops help draw out the subtle sweetness that really balances it out, making it very drinkable.  An absolute pleasure.","USA","ElGaucho56"
956,"2007-10-11",5.0,"Very complex beer that has been with me in every milestone of my life (and in most every useless moment as well). Sheer psychological love alone compells me to give it a perfect rating.
A carefully composed symphony of orthogonal flavours (and styles) that can only be fully absorbed if you deeply sniff the surface of the wide glass while drinking it. The only way to take this ambrosia is to really make love to it and bring it maximally inside you, and drink, drink! Floral and bitter, sweet and dry, male and female, Orval is always both of everything.Im sure some people only gave this a bad rating so thered be plenty of Orval left for themselves.","Ghent, BELGIUM","MMortier"

Then a hoppy earthy center and dry hoppy finish with bit of mineral taste. Much drier and seems a touch IPAish than several other Belgian ales Ive had. As beer warmed the malt became stickier and sweeter and separated from the hops less effectively but the finish remained quite dry, in contrast to other ales and strong ales that seemed to mesh more tightly with a bit of warmth. Still a good and different selection overall.

Aroma hit me first with a sourness that instantly made my mouth start watering, upon further inspection Im getting a woodiness type bitter fragrance and something unidentifiable that must be what is known as ""horse blanket"" (no idea what horseblanket smells like). Smooth, with super light and active carbonation. This stuff makes my mouth feel strange and has an astringent quality to it. Flavors man, there is stuff in here I cant even put my finger on. There is a distinct ginger ale taste here though. Im also getting a little perfumy sopressata type flavor. Also, some vanilla, wood, malt, citrus, and vinegar. Moderately to highly bitter throuhout and quite tart middle to end. Finish has good floral spicy hoppiness lingering as well as tart citrusy zing. There are things Im missing, Ill get them next time I guess. This is the strangest beer Ive put to paper so far.

Overall, not too exciting but has some pretty interesting and complex flavors.","Renton, Washington, USA","Bradrcr"
956,"2007-09-18",3.9,"Bottle aged for nearly 15 months. I wasnt immediately taken with Orval, but its become a real sleeper to me over time. Its interesting, as it has some of the extremely dry characteristics of certain singels, with a bitter finish and an extremely lively body. But the aroma and the depth of the flavors distinguish it, with some sour apple, anise, and flower petal notes in there. Nice warming finish too, despite the relatively low ABV.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
956,"2007-09-18",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2007 A hazy orange beer with a dense, ample-sized head that slowly disperses. It has a sweet orange aroma with a soupcon of perfume intertwined. The flavour alludes to a malty taste but I find it predominantly bitter, with the hops lasting long on the palate giving a dry finish. This, my first trappist beer, was an interesting, if not altogether extraordinary, experience.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","sm89walt"

Taste is the same, with a nice mix of flavors such as apple, dark fruit, vanilla, and lemon coming to the fore as you drink it.  Alcohol not noticeable, though I was surprised to see the alcohol content is so low.  Not the best of the Trappist ales, but a very nice beer in its own right.","North Bellmore, New York, USA","thenick"

956,"2007-09-15",4.4,"Very aromatic malty floral aroma. (I am noting this before how it looks because it is so aromatic that I could smell it before I was done pouring.)

956,"2007-09-09",4.4,"Aroma is a nice sweet malty scent with back tones that come across with a sour note.  It has that fruity scent to that seems to be common in these Belgian brews.  Color is a burnt orange with a slight haze.  Carbonation is good with a very nice thought and thick head.  Taste is fizzy, sweet, fruity and sour.  Starting with a medium body it goes down with a creamy and yet fizzy feel. Finish comes in with a sweet malt flavor that quickly turns fruity, this is then backed by a mild sour flavor, and then it ends with a smooth bitterness.

Taste has a somewhat bitter edge to it with what seems like that grass tone again. Though I think it would be a smoked grass, if that makes sense.

956,"2007-09-03",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2009 This beer seriously cant be more fun. Ive had quite the relationship with Orval over the years. When I first tried it I thought the bottle was bad because it tasted too much like Pine Sol. When I tried it the second time the same thing happened. When I tried it again it started to dawn on me: that was the way it was supposed to taste. Then I realized I needed to reckon with the beer and engage it fully. I asked Orval to teach me its secrets, or else I would risk losing out on understanding it. I drank Orval again and again and again all the while without really liking it. One day, BOOM, it hit me like an epiphany. I have loved Orval ever since that moment. Orval is simply exceptional, and proves that brewing is an art. Its moderate alcohol content also makes it the kind of beer one could and should drink regularly. Its dry, almost shockingly so because of its hop astringency. The yeast shines through every time. Visually stunning, the head is perfect and couldnt be a lovelier looking brew. A finely honed, fascinating, and classic beer that stands up to what you would not expect it to in a lineup of heavier bigger brews. That tells all for now...this is one seriously cool beer and honestly no two bottles are exactly the same. Its ALIVE!","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
956,"2007-09-03",3.8,"Bottle. Pours hazy cider, off white head. Aroma is funky, musty, tangy, sour; dried fruit, cheese, meat. Flavor is tangy wheat, subtle meat and spices, faint dried fruit. Well balanced.","Washington DC, USA","zebracakes"
956,"2007-09-03",4.7,"This one took me a while. The first time I had it, I didnt like it. I had read about it, new it was seriosly hyped and then was bitterly disappointed when I didnt like it. Just too sour I thought. I decided to try it again a few weeks later just in case. The next time was better. I made a habit of trying it every few weeks and each time Id notice something new about it and like it more. This trend continued until my trip to Brussels a few weeks ago. I had quite a few bottles over there and now Im hooked. My words couldnt possibly due justice to complex flavours and aromas in this beer. Every sniff and sip reveal something different and every bottle appears to be different. What is consistant though is the beautiful orangey liquid with its fantastic long lasting head, with a spicy, citric and sour infinitly complex taste.

I think I may have to re-rtate every other beer Ive rated to put this rating in a proper context. Praise  the lord.","IRELAND","Wobbler"
956,"2007-09-01",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 19, 2013 Flaske. Kæmpe gusher på denne 1 1/2 årige Orval. Desværre var dette ikke en af de bedre Oravls.

956,"2007-08-29",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2008 Bottle. Pours hazy amber/blonde with a massive bubbly off-white head. Aroma is ripe fruit, yeast, some banana, and slight hops.

956,"2007-08-29",5.0,"UPDATED: SEP 27, 2009 Re-rerate: Four and a half month old bottle. Stunning. The last few bottles have proven this to be a truly perfect beer. There is so much variety depending on age, but that makes me love it even more as it can be multiple beers for multiple moods while still being outstanding in every iteration. The hops and fruity esters are phenomenal in younger examples, with brett and dry elegance taking over as time progresses. This truly is a perfect five, and it is a tragedy that its not appreciated enough to land in the top 50.

Re-rate, 11/26/07.   Ive finally come around to re-rating this almost three months later, and Systemblaget still has bottles bottled on the same day, so Im getting a sample with 9 months of age instead of 6.   It may be that the beer has evolved considerably in those three months, or it may be that I have evolved as well since one of my first ratings, but this rating experience is very different from the original.   The pour is a clear orange/amber with an absolutely massive lasting head.   Bubbles stream from everywhere to sustain the mountainous foam for quite some time, until you wear it into a creamy layer that laces all the way to the bottom.   Beautiful to say the least.   The aroma is a little different than I remember: dryer and much more complex.   Yeast, sour fruit, hops, bubble-gum ,and cloves hit you to start.   Very spicy cloves.   As the beer warms, more sugar comes out, with some caramel and a good helping of sweet cherries with a lingering acidity.   The flavor is dryer than I recall; much dryer than the aroma would lead you to believe.   Hop resin scrapes your tongue with a lasting bitter finish, and a slight citrus acidity rides over it all.   The body is light and heavily but smoothly carbonated, with a long bitter and lean finish.   the alcohol taste that was present before is completely absent now.   Im awe-struck at the complexity of this beer.   I didnt know that you could smell so many amazing things in one glass.   Its like a whole table of spiced christmas confections, and Im loving it.   Its leanness and dryness also make it supremely drinkable, which is more than I can say for any other Trappist ale that Ive had. ྪ,5,9,4,18=4.6)

   (original rating) From a bottle in Lund, Sweden on 8-28-07.   Pours a murky golden orange amber with a substatial head that stays for quite awhile in a tulip glass.   The aroma is probably one of the best-sweet apricots linger with tangy lemon and spicy cinnamon.   I was expecting a better flavor out of this, but something was lacking.   There was a good mouthfeel with heavy carbonation, but an intrusiveness of alcohol lingered over it and ruined the flavor.   The bitterness in the finish was definitely refreshing, but for a beer bottled at only 6.2% ABV, there shouldnt have been this prevalent of an alcohol taste.   Ill definitely give it another try.ƙ,4,6,3,16)","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Malty, mediciny nose, with a mineral taste. Ill try it again in a few months, but this one was bad. RERATE: I have seen the light!

956,"2007-07-25",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2008 Aroma is a bit funky, woody, and somewhat of light colored fruit. Pours a yellow ish orange color with a large pillowly head. At first the bubbles are slow rising to the top almost like a reverse snowfall and then they begin to move quickly like soda. Must be the brett.  Hops are present but in moderation. The malt is very pale and seems to play second fiddle to the yeast.  Tastes a bit like Granny smith apples with some barnyard notes such as horse blanket. Not my favorite but the beer is well balanced and well crafted, however the taste is too mild for my liking.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"

The Sour Fest was the first time I had a fresh Orval that was the least funky that I had ever tried. Hoppy, lemon aroma with no wet blanket. Taste was bright and again hoppy. Hops were spicey.

The aroma was spicy and fruity, not as yeasty as an Abbey Quadrupel.  The mouthfeel was medium-bodied with medium carbonation.  The taste was not to my liking.

Original Rating: 7/4/5/2/9=2.7Re-Rate: Bottled on 04/04/06, drank on 02/22/08. The aroma is better (sour, a little funky, some apple) and the taste is overall better too (not just a bitter, spice bomb). I still thought the taste was really lacking, but it definitely was an improvement from the first bottle. New Score: 8/5/6/3/13=3.5. I will average the scores.Old Rating: 7/5/6/2/11=3.1. Re-rate: [Bottle, 26 months old] Pours hazy orange with a big, rocky, off-white head. Aroma explodes out of the glass with a huge amount of pineapple, some banana-like esters, brett--some light leather and funk does show through as it warms, and the pineapple gives way to more of a very subdued apple character after awhile. Taste is bretty, with tropical fruit, before giving way to minerally and yeasty notes, with a solid malt backbone underlying it all, decent bitterness, and faint smokiness towards the end.  Medium mouthfeel, dry, long finish. Alright, well I can at least see what all the raving is about now, even if it still isnt my absolute favorite. I would have given it a 9/5/8/4/17=4.3, but as I have been doing, I will knock it down for inconsistency, but still it gets a 3.9. Very interesting, and I will buy it again.Old rating: 8/5/7/4/15 = 3.9. I have had a few bottles since my last rating in 09, and all of them have been great. The bottle I am drinking now is from late 11, so it has a little over a year on it. Wonderful interplay of fruit and mineral character, with the malt coming through just enough towards the end. Dry, mildly acidic, good mouthfeel. All around a solid beer which I do not tire of. My only complaint is that it is fairly expensive.Another bottle from late 11 (~15 months old), and this one is probably the best bottle Ive ever had.

956,"2007-06-09",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2008 Bottled 11/04/06, aged 20 months.  Third time is the charm!  The magic of Orval finally hit me!  After reading so much about how wonderful this brew is, I stared to wonder if there was something wrong with me, as I simply didn’t ""get it"".  Well, today I have been born again.  Identical in appearance to the previous two bottles, the difference here is clearly due to the wonders that nearly two years of Brett conditioning ca do.  Similar in fruit and spice character to the second rating, this version is infinitely more dry, funky, and tart.  The intensity of the beer seems to have grown significantly, yet its drinkability has never been better.  So enjoyable, I could hardly put the glass down to contemplate things.  Clearly, it is only inconsistency that keeps this beer from top 50 status, as this most recent version was absolutely stellar.Bottled 7/05/07, aged 5 months. Rated 7/5/6/4/14 3.6. My second encounter with Orval was completely different, and infinitely more enjoyable than the first.  Gone are the sharp metallic tendencies, replaced by bitter Brett goodness and perfectly complimentary spices of coriander and clove.  Floral hops are more pronounced than before, as is honey sweetness.  Minerals are still present, but more subdued.  Perhaps it is the age, the temperature, or my palate that has changed.  I would venture to guess it is all three.  One thing is for sure, I have a newfound appreciation for Orval.  Still, I cant fathom how so many can call this a 5.0 beer.  Even a good bottle, which I seem to have found here, isnt anywhere near perfection.Bottled 7/11/06, aged 11 months.   Rated 5/5/4/4/11 2.9.  Pours a translucent golden-honey brown.  Large off-white head with good lacing.  Prominent aromas are fig, spices, and minerals.  Flavors are the same, but also include bitter orange and a decent amount of hops.  Appearance is excellent, but the flavor let me down a little.  It was a bit to metallic for my liking.  I expected it to open up as it warmed like many Belgians do, but it never happened.

Ive been drinking this since the days when I could walk to the moan and dove.  This light trappist beer has a great sour funk that I found amazing as I was beginning to get into the trappist ales and cantillon lambics.   The aroma is citrusy lemon and peppery.  The mouthfeel is creamy and light at the same time.  The flavs include citrus, barnyard funk, nuts, and slight pepper.  The sour funk flavor is this medium bodied beer is what makes it so unique and amazing.  The finish is buttery sweet with a touch of hops.

The flavor has a light wheat malt, slight wheat sourness, leathery yeast, slight aromatic hoppiness, but plenty of bitter dry hops.  The finish is quite dry with a residual sourness, lingering graininess, and dry-hop bitterness.

Taste is somewhat grainy and rather mild, but very smooth for a Belgian ale.  Very complex flavors as you get into the brew and surprisingly well balanced.

Flavour is citric, malt sweetness which is good for balance to the sour/bitter hop notes. Strong bitterness into the finish. First time I had this I was in awe, I had found the perfect beer and no one around me could understand the same thing. Ive come back and been in doubt several times, but this one deserves to be in the same league as the golden 12.

Color is a cloudy amber-orange, lighter towards the top and bottom of the glass. A steady, frothy white head sits on top and sticks to the sides leaving bubbly lacing. Heavily carbonated but mainly thin palate, some hoppy dryness in the finish. Tastes lightly sour and alcoholic. Definite orange notes and hops.

Aged one year, this beer shows huge brett character, which complements the sweetnesses and citrus flavors tremendously. Rounds out the palate and adds to my overall impression.

956,"2007-03-14",3.9,"Bottle. A very complexly aromatic Belgian ale (no surprise there). If given the time one could pick out numerous bold and faint notes. The malt has a grainy/nutty/milk chocolate smell to it. And the hops smells of herbs, grass and citrus. There was a soapy yeast smell and light hints of banana, mace, alcohol and a slight mustiness which keeps it from being a ten on the aroma scale in my book. It has an off white, fizzy head with good lacing and is fully lasting. Color is a murky red/brown. Taste could be a bit more complex though. It starts off lightly bitter and finishes on a heavy acidic/bitter note. It has a medium body, a dry texture and the carbonation is a bit too fizzy. It all finishes with a moderate astringent feel.

Slightly hazy orange color with a big consistent white head. Aroma of fruits, some bretty funk and some hoppy notes.

A dry finish with some citric-lemon touches, a bit of spice, and (surprisingly at this age) some hops. Medium-bodied. Wow, very close to perfection. Funny how I gave this beer the same score now and when I was rather new to good beers. Im almost tempted to open another bottle but I want to save the two bottles I still have in case the only store in Israel that still carries this (all bottles at this age by the way), doesnt have any more left.

Slightly skunky, the malt is nearly transparent - very little sweetness to it. Strong bitter citrus notes play against grassy hops, making this very refreshing but slightly wanting in terms of balance.

Created immense stalagmite of dense creamy foam; had to settle a few minutes to pour more. Whole earth, with slight corn and chiclet gum scents. Started it with a very spicy shrimp/pasta dish, the fire of which the alcohol immensely amplified;  I had to quickly wolf down dinner, cleanse my palate, and get back to the beer. Orval at first doesnt seem to have a lot of taste, just dryness, but as I see the glass down, it has a slightly caramel-woody front, and a dry-hoppy finish; this beer is multifaceted and satisfying. Only the cottony cobwebs of lace are left now. Even though this is dangerously drinkable already, I think its not quite yet ""come together"" as intended, and will sample an older bottle in the future.

956,"2007-01-22",4.7,"UPDATED: MAY 17, 2007 I remember telling an ex girlfriend many years ago that I loved craft beer, especially from Belgium. She went to our local store, Halls, in Colleyville, Texas, and bought me Orval. I hated it. Looking back, I think that was my first encounter with Brettanomyces. That was in 1997. After four more years and falling in love with lambics, I bought another bottle; the world changed in the blink of an eye. Ive been in love ever since. 
A monstrosity of a rocky white head with gaping crevasses dutifully adorns a frolicsome orange body with forceful carbonation. The lid of foam is everlasting; even when the liquid is gone a glob of soapy bubbles remain. This lacing is the reason I take notice of lacing to this day. Aroma is decadent, brimming over with coriander, brett, fresh farmhouse funkiness, lavender, tangerines, herbs and hints at a million other brief nuances of guilty pleasure. The flavor, oh the exciting flavor, it never gets tiresome. Heaping piles of funk, citrus, tangy hops, wood, candy sugar, cream, yeast and enough sweet malt to round it out gracefully. Palate is so exhuberant, so lavish and intriguing. The finish is soft and spicy at once, and is clearly the epitome of sophistication. This beer still has me at my knees begging for the secret, for the answers. Simply amazing. Orval really did change me. Thankfully it wasnt the only one that had a profound effect on my tastes and meditations about craft beers. Ill have another!","Alabama, USA","boboski"

956,"2007-01-17",3.4,"this ale has a head like no other.  foamy, airiated three-finger head.  though it erodes, it never diasappears.  what little goes does leave a beautiful lacing on the glass.  cloudy orange-amber tint.  i almost hated taking a sip, and would rather admire the appearance for a while.theres an aroma im not subjected to too often.  it is hoppy, but its not an american hoppy.  it leans towards that of fuzzy oak and smooth herbs (is there such a thing?).  i thought it had an orange essnce, but upon further review, i say its closer to orange peel.  the taste reveals a spicy feel but an oaky palate.  the dry-hop is best shown here.  orval has the fizziness of a bottle of moet & chandons nectar imperial - in that, it just doesnt ever subside.  its good, but i prefer a lingering finish.  orval does not possess this.  i think i was hoping for a more tongue-coating experience.","Murfreesboro, Tennessee, USA","andyhite"

Taste; the grass/hay qualities jump out at me at first as well as a bit of a funky earthiness. The mildly sweet honey flavors come out next, followed by a tartness thats a little drying in the finish with a bit of a hop bitterness.

Not too much spice - was expecting more clove, banana, coriander, and whatnot - but still excellent.  A really nice bitter finish that youre not going to find in very many other Trappists - definitely sets this brew apart from its closest peers.

One of the most interesting noses but lacking any depth on the flavor or palate.  Not bad but nothing compared to other trappists.

956,"2006-11-17",4.6,"This is one great friggin beer. WOW. I know, I know...not real thought provoking. But when you get something this great it can be hard sometimes to put into words how good the beer is. The aroma is just something beautiful to behold (or inhale in this case). Its slightly sour acidicness made me think of a wine a little, but there was a bit of pepperyness there, some orangepeels and a little bit of funk going around. Appearance is a dark burnt orange color with an incredibly huge fluffy head. This head was so huge you could build something on it and itd last 50 damn years. HUGE! Mouthfeel was really complex. Just when i thought it was bubbly and carbonated it switched gears and was creamy and light. The flavor though is the best part. Incredibly complex from start to finish. Another reviewer hit it head on, when he said its a flemish sour, witbier and a saison all combined. I might even go as far as saying its got a little lambic in it as well. The bitterness factor in this beer is just off the charts. Its not bitter like IPA or DIPA bitter where the flavor just sort of wears ya down. This is uplifting and intense. This is one of the best beers Ive had in quite a few weeks. For some reason Ive not reviewed this beer before, so I guess it was high-time it got going. I recommend this beer to anyone who wants to have a GREAT example of a Belgian ale.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

Nice rocky head dies down to a pleasant spotty film. Very inviting nose with citrus and autumn spices. clean, red amber.  The taste, a bit muted, I thought. Good hop and spice, very dry, a bit astringent. Perhaps best to pair with food as it would stand up well. Id like to try a 3-5 year old bottle, I think a bit of mingling and mellowing could send this beer into the upper echelon. For now, just good.","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","Jayb0"
956,"2006-11-10",4.3,"One of the worlds most fragrant biers, citrus abounds (dry hopping) plus spice produced from Brettanomyces wrapped together like a work of art.  The Appearence is clean & more clear than I remember (additional filtering I suppose) a radient orange amber with excellent head retention....perfect.

The flavour has a fine Pilsner like base with carmel undertones.  Has aggressive lactic bite, but mellow in the finish, dry yet sweet character of candi sugar.  I love to pair this with stinky extra extra sharp cheese but for most palates would overwhelm the dish.

RERATE oh the brett funk is awesome - a Belgian IPA and better than all the recent interpretations. Just gets better and better. Great with or without age. Initially it is quite hoppy. With a year or two the malt is more prevalent and the lovely brett kiss is more appealing. My favourite lambic :). The head on this is a monster - it just wont die. Foamy at the top and bubbly at the bottom, clinging to the beer with every twirl and parry of the glass. Truly a beer for the ages.","JAPAN","jonno"
956,"2006-11-07",3.5,"Served at cellar temperature in goblet. Been a long time since ive had one of these but ive been looking forward to it. Aroma is intense; spice, cirtus (orange, lemon, possibly even grapefruit?), sherbert, subdued roasted malts and floral hops. Pours a opaque copper body with a fluffy sort of head. Body isnt a thick as I imagined. Flavour reminds me almost of an IPA of sorts; quite dry, cirtus hop and spice notes, long lingering bitterness, with a lemon peel sort of finish. Almost medicinal at times. Unique, certainly, seems to take on a style of its own, particularly at this temperature; perhaps thats why I dont feel it was as good as I remembered.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

956,"2006-11-05",4.7,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2016 Bottle (fresh). Pours a gorgeous golden amber with a rich full fluffy - even foamy - head. The aroma is complex and fascinating: mild vinegar notes and dusty barnyard, honey and mint,spicy yeasts. The flavor is equally complex: very dry, some mouth-puckering sourness around the sides but this comes on late, lemon peel,  just a hint of funk, a long dusty hop finish. The mouthfeel is the weakest of the lot; it seems rather thin to me, and rather hollow. But that is a minor concern; this beer deserves its reputation. 

Mini-vertical, Spring 2009:
1 year -- mint, herbal.
2 years -- the classic Orval taste that I remember. Juicy through middle with spice on the front and so brett-dry on the close. Perfection. 
4 years -- wine-like, acid notes bring out the wood, considerable loss of carbonation

Sept 09 - straight from Whole Foods. I definitely like it with a bit more age.

There are hops in the background, lending to a freshness in the smell.  The flavor is slightly sour, with more grape, and maybe a melon-ness toward the finish.

Pleasant sour aroma with some yeast, dough, grape, citrus, and floral hops detectable.

956,"2006-10-28",4.6,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2008 Rating done on a four year old bottle and one year old bottle.  Both poured copper with a rich white head.  The younger one had a noticably larger head.  The on the older bottle was spicy and brett-like with earthy and yeasty notes.  Very clean for the age.  The younger beers aroma was spicy with a nectar fruit aspect instead of the brett.  There was some earth and yeast, but not as much as the four year old bottle.  The mouthfeel for the older bottle was medium / thin and crisp with very light soft carbonation.  The younger bottle had a heavier body with carbonation that started out soft, but got more sharp on the finish.  For the taste the older bottle had a lot of the brett qualities from the aroma along with lots of spice, coriander and dry earthy traits.  The finish has lots of spice and tart lemon.  Very dry finish.  The year old bottle also has lots of spice and has a taste between brett and dry nectar fruits.  The bottle is semi-dry, not as dry as the older bottle.  The finish has some fruits and lots of dry spices.  Both bottles are crisp and refreshing for a Trappist ale.  Both of the bottles show a respectable amount of hops as well adding to the crispness - they are more prominant in the young bottle.  Overall an excellent beer coming from both young and old bottles.  Rerate just to bump up numbers.  The more I have this beer the more impressive it is.  Amazing complexity, works for any season, dry, refreshing and unique.  There are some that put out something that is their version of this beer & nothing comes remotely close.  Another numbers bump.  This is probably the best beer of the lot of I’ve had.  At some point I need to buy a couple cases and try them a few months from each other to see the complexity that comes with age of this.  Fantastic beer that is somewhat different (or reveals itself differently) each time, yet is always distinctly and unmistakeably Orval each time.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

Pours a cloudy copper orange with a thick, long-lasting creamy off white head not unlike the head on top of a root beer float.  A very slow pour is required for this beer.  Excellent lacing down to the bottom of the glass.  Pleasant yeasty aroma with floral notes as well.  It was in the flavor that this beer disappointed me.  While the aromas were rather pronounced, I found the flavors to be very subdued.  I sat with this beer for a long while allowing it to warm, but I just did not find this beer all that flavorful.  Dry, bitter finish.  Ive been told this beer can vary from bottle to bottle, so I will leave myself a note to re-try this brew in a few months and come back to re-rate if necessary.

956,"2006-10-27",3.5,"Pours deep orange, light amber, with white head. The aroma is lush and floral - a sweet fragrance, literally floral, formed from hop aroma, malts, and some fruity notes (peaches, apples, grapes). The flavor is peculiar - very light body, not very sweet or floral taste. It tastes hoppy with a touch of acidity (maybe some grapefruit or other bitter fruit). The flavor of old, stale hops overpowers the malts and fruitiness in the taste department. The finish is very dry with a very long astringent after-taste.

Pours a slightly hazed orange (becoming more hazed towards the bottles bottom) with a big white head with some staying power.  Looks a bit overcarbonated, maybe.  The nose seemed at first run of the mill belgian.  Subsequent efforts revealed richer malt, deeper fruit (figgy rather than apple-y), and some herbage, maybe peppermint?  I can even smell hops subtly.  The palate is smooth and creamy, not overcarbonated as I had first guessed.  The flavor is really very nice with big ass malt.  Not too sweet, a bit of wheat though.  The Belgian sourness is subdued, but theres discernable herbal flavors like peppermint that also supply balance to malt... and dare I say it, theres some hops!  A piney little taste lingers a bit longer than most of the other flavors.  Really complex, yet really easy to drink.  I cant think of any beers with this much going on at such a low ABV.  Id buy/drink more if it werent 5 bucks a bottle.  Glad I finally bought a bottle after having this at a tasting.

Wow,  I was a bit off the mark way back when, but this is still a lovely beer.  Appearance spot on, other than the head retention, thins to a decent film more quickly.  Now, the herbs seem to come out a TON more.  A very very light sweetness.  Hops?  Bandaids?  I might be crazy, but this reminds me a bit of Luciernaga in the nose  Some alcohol, but not much.  A bit of straw.  The mouth is about spot on what I said.  Perhaps a little slick.  The flavors are sharp.  A bit of that tartness that Im starting to think of as Brett.  A very light sweetness, perhaps in the tropical fruit mold, but reminding me of Luciernaga very much still.  A good shot of those hops, despite the bottle being two years old.  VERY herbal.  I think minty is fair.  A lingering acidic bitterness, but clean and dry, like champagne in a way.  Im going to have to pick up three bottles and try to age them to different degrees.  current ratings reflect most resent tasting.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

Cloudy deep gold color.  Very lively carbonation with a big and dense white head.  Aroma is damp, earthy, and a little hoppy.  Flavor is quite complex and very dry.  Starts malty and dry, becomes a little more fruity and yeasty, and finishes slightly sour with a hint of alcohol.  This is a challenging beer and truly unique.  I definitely need to grab another bottle or three to really explore this beer.  Also, the one I sampled is very young, so I think an older vintage might be even better.  Im sure my rating will go up once I get a chance to immerse myself in this intriguing beer again in the future...","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"
956,"2006-09-29",3.6,"Dark amber, with a massive off-white head.  The aroma is flowery, wheaty and a bit sweet.  A bit flat in the flavor, with a lot of flavors subtle flavors.  Nothing jumps out.  A bit sour in the finish.","Peoples Republic of Athens, Ohio, USA","dkoonce"

956,"2006-09-27",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2007 Trappist beer with a sweet, citrussy and yeasty smell and tast. Could it also be that some orange peel is in there. Nice complex flavor. Smooth and round beer, compared to other Trappist beers. 29-09-2006 Second time I have tasted this beer. And it really grows on you. It was a bit cold when it was served, and it clearly got better as temperature raised in the glass.

956,"2006-09-23",4.3,"Murky orange body with 5 or 6 fingers of head, typical of an abbey or trappist ale. Tons of lacing too. Smells sweet, citrussy, and yeasty.

956,"2006-09-22",3.0,"6.2%. Best before 19-09-2009.  Pours a massive frothy head, medium orange color. Highly carbonated with geyser like rush of bubbles from base of snifter. Aroma is wonderful and inviting. Orange citrus nose with cloves; light toast and spicy. Spicyness quickly evident in flavor, with some cloves. Not as much malt as expected from nose and this made the presentation seem unbalanced. I know Belgians are defined as being crisp and dry but this was thin and light and this was complicated by the big alcohol warmth, which without body to back it was off-putting. I hate to say it but this was almost like a malt liquor in misbalance between alcohol and body. I have to admit that after I stopped thinking about how disappointed I was and just started drinking it as a beer I found it to be more pleasant and quite drinkable. But Ill take a Chimay anyday over Orval.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","brewgirlca"
956,"2006-09-21",4.9,"UPDATED: NOV 23, 2007 #300!!!  I dont know why it has taken me so long to try this trappist.  Not a very appealing bottle/label.  What an amazing aroma.  Spicy malt aroma, and slightly yeasty.  Very herbal.  Extremely unique aroma!  What a beautiful pour. Deep amber orange color and slightly cloudy.  Wow.  Flavor is malty and a bit tart.  very dry.  Very herbal taste. slightly tart and not very sweet.  Very dry!   There must be an extremely unique yeast strain that they use, I just cant place a finger  on the all of the flavors.  Fresh green apples, honey, slight citrus.  A very well rounded glass.","Georgia, USA","unclemattie"
956,"2006-09-20",5.0,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2008 September 2006.  Cloudy shade of mahogany and amber.  Very malty aroma, heavy on yeast, with some lemon pepper, spiced rum, and honey.  Truly unique flavor incorporating tart red apples, or cider, brown sugar, and pear skins.  Generally more sour than bitter or sweet, combining tannic dryness with fruity acidity.  Tastes like a wilderness spring or a melted Siberian glacier.  Immense and satisfying.

July 2008.  Several bottles consumed in early this month, bottled on 6/20/07.  Frothy golden hues.  Herbal, musky, perfume-like aroma of flowers and ground soft spices, with a lemongrass sprightliness.  Deep fruit flavors hidden in a dusty funk so magical and unnameable that it must come from some distant fairyland world.  Nuttiness of malts keeping it safely earthbound in the boundaries of beer.  A fulsome texture with a soft diamond cut edge.  Completely enchanting.  Every time I drink an Orval I feel like Ive resigned my imagination to be captured and manipulated, and what a feeling of surrender it is.

August 2008.  Bottled on 4/24/07.  A sunny marigold haze.  Herbal and sweet lemon curd and white tea aroma.  Cantaloupe.  Apricots in cinnamon.  Its really dried out, but the sweet-sour punch of fruit couldnt be more frolicking and fresh.  Deep honey dipped dough of perfect pale malt.  The delicate beauty of its floral character is simple and entirely breathtaking.  This is inhaling the Garden of Eden.  Flavor is dusky and dry, and beginning to develop the cheesy kind of wooden funk thats so arrestingly endearing in wildly fermented beer; again the liveliness of tropical and temperate stone fruits and herbal sensations from the bountiful dry hops joyfully complements the natural mineral texture of the yeast.  AND IT IS MAGICAL!  Cold, herbal and dry after a velvet cream of vanilla in a swirl of complicated, refined textures; finishes strong and soft on lemon pepper, flowers, and minerals, distantly.  Its certainly for a particular kind of taste, I think.  And to mine its perfect.  

August 2008.  Bottled on 10/11/05.  It’s really dried out, and the malts have driven in deep.  Still fancifully lacquered in perfume and basement must, but warmer and burlier, generally.  The floral and white/stone fruit flavors are not merely muscled away by the malt progression but still dance brightly at the surface; the malts have slowly carved out a dark ocean of thicker, more commanding flavors beneath the endearingly sparkly tart-herbal starlight of the beer in its earlier lives.  And while that’s such a stunning feature after three years in the bottle, what’s most apparent is how utterly dry it’s become, even amidst so much depth of flavor and richness of palate.  This is the best bottle I’ve had.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
956,"2006-09-17",4.9,"UPDATED: JAN 5, 2008 The Orval is a style on its own. Poured in my Orval glass, hazy amber-orange colour with its thick and everlasting creamy white head. The aroma is spicy, with notes of herbs, flowers, citrus, malt, yeast and other wonders which I couldnt put a name tag on.The mouthfeel is creamy, taste is spicy, malty, well hopped, but not that bitter, herbal notes, flower, horse blanket....

956,"2006-09-15",4.2,"With all the Orval talk going on I figured I would check my rating since I knew I had it a number of times.  Wow no rating but I think now after 1700 beers I can appreciate it more than when I first started rating.  So I broke out the Orval glass tonight and popped the top.  The glass fill to the top with a hazy orange-amber color with a lrge almost white head. Sweet fruity malt with a nice funky character of leather and horse (my favorite).  Some dusty character.   The flavor starts a little sweet but finishes pretty dry.  Some fruitiness at the start and hops at the finish.  Spicey and bitter on the finish.  Even some warmth in the throat.  Very lively mouthfeel.  The born on date was 4/11/06.  I might pop one a month after now remembering what this is all about.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"

Sweet floral aroma with malts, fresh fruits (apple, pineapple), hops, and pine needles.  Flavors are initially sweet and malty with floral and citrus overtones, along with fresh fruits, and hops.  But some strange, indescribable piney, leathery, musty, woody flavors also appear.  Very soft and smooth mouthfeel, but the finish is dry and astringent.

956,"2006-08-24",3.8,"Pours a brownish amber with a substantial frothy head.  Aromas of bubble gum, plum, yeast, cloves and licorice are a treat.

At first, I noticed a hoppy aroma which surprised me, but then I read the commercial description and I understood why.  I also picked up a strong yeast aroma.  It had the usualy hard core yeast taste, small alcohol lingering presence, grapes and mild bananas.  It has a fairly dry feel which I assume are from the hop presence.  Not bad - not too over the top like some others in this style that I havent enjoyed.","Boise, Idaho, USA","pinkzambia"

956,"2006-08-19",4.4,"Bottle.  Pours a slightly hazy orangish copper colored body under a large frothy and creamy bone white head with great retention and lacing.  I just love those craggy heads that tower up over the rim of the glass with no intention of running over the sides.  Aroma is fruity and funky and beautiful.  The brett is there, but maybe not as fully developed versus some of the older bottles that Ive had.  A little citrus, some hops, and a dozen other things that I cant specifically identify.  Kind of floral in character.  Flavor is dry with plenty of funk and brett.  Some leather, yeast, alcohol, hoppiness, sugary and slightly tart at the same time, and somehow the malt is still there below this all.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with alot of foaming carbonation.  Finishes bone dry with lingering tart bretty goodness.  Overall, I cant really do this beer justice.  Its a classic, love it or hate it, theres no denying its unique and complex.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

The aroma is very nice as well--mostly floral, with a little bit of must--but alas it is a belgian. The flavor is complex. Floral hints and definite fruitiness, but the flavor is overpowered by the strange mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is very carbonated and dry, and it made my buddy remark that it was sort of like ""drinking an alka-seltzer"". Not the taste mind you, but the mouthfeel.

956,"2006-07-03",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 23, 2012 1a) 9 months old. Pineapple, green apple, banana, cinnamon and horse aroma. Antiseptic and biscuit notes; earthy spice and yeast, low bitterness and carbonation, underripe banana and pepper. So drinkable, but overrated. 
1b) (most recent rate)- 5 months old. Aroma of dishcloth, mould on gooseberries, horse rubbed down with aloe vera moisturiser. Bazooka chews and pine, more juiciness than bite, hints of biscuits. Quite wooden and resinous with shavings of lime, tonic splashes, a fair bit of alcohol. G+T finish. Needs time. 

2) Shelf of bottles courtesy of Jenner Imports. Bludgeoning floral aroma; lily pollen, lavender, pig shit, cough-inducing carbon dioxide, gooseberry jamminess, unblended lambic, hospital corridor, funk. Just so lean and sessionable. Mad, flowery, gooseberry hops, biting fresh yeast, biscuity malts for balance. Cant get enough of that lack of residual sugars. Mmm. In a world where everything is becoming the same, still unique. 

3)(Original rate) Muddy orange, spiralling fingers of bubbles. Grass, alcohol, bubblegum and cinammon in the aroma. Whatever Jagermeister is spiced with, that also. Could happily sit here inhaling this all evening. Might wash my hair in it. Flavour begins with sweet, overripe banana, but finishes with a bludgeoning punch of dry hops you just dont see coming. Irresistibly fragrant, well-balanced beer. 

4) Re-rate, 23/01/07. Didnt mention the pillows of suds, wheaty afters and aromatic herbal booziness. This is simply one of the most unique, complex and uncompromising beers in the world. 

5) Re-rate 20/03/07 Hmm. Musty hops, horseblanket, booze, banana, cardboard and metal. Nothing like as bitter or maybe as great as I once thought. Still a classic, though...

6)(09/10/07) Acidic sparkle, lambic funk. Sour lemon and brie rind in the nose like an Oude gueuze. But no other beer in the world smells like this. Or tastes like it, come to think of it. Hop onslaught cushioned with biscuity malt. What an intense balance. A beer that yields up something different every time you drink it, and its always something good.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"
956,"2006-06-30",3.8,"Bottled 05, best by 2010. Aroma is grassy, perfume, flowers, alcohol, bubble gum. Pours cloudy orange with bubbly foam on top. Taste is big on the flowers- what I would imagine dandelions to taste like, but I cant say for sure. I get some banana in there, with other generic ""fruit"" flavors. I would like to steep cut up pears in this beer. The perfume aroma couples with the spice (certainly clove and cinnamon) in a way that makes it sometimes taste soapy (in a bad way).  Finishes quite dry. Bubbly carbonation is appropriate, but not my cup of tea.","minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","IPAndy"
956,"2006-06-29",4.4,"bottle.  bottled on 4/01/05.  Aroma:  Alot going on here.  Mint, coriander, floral, cherry, vanilla, and strangely enough, cotton candy.  Appearance:  depending on the light, its either deep golden or light orange.  Either way its very hazy with a good amount of floaties dancing about the brew.  Large off white creamy looking head never really disappeared.  Just kind of diminished into a smaller head.  Lacing that could only be called perfect.  Flavor:  Where to start?  The floral flavor pops out first.  Not roses, kind of reminds me of Hydrangias.  Next sip its fruit: lemon, banana, apple, pear.  Next sip spiciness: coriander, clove, cinnamon.  Then theres a subtle earthiness underneath everything.  I cant do this one justice.  Way to much complexity for me to break down.  Only off thing is a slight metallic twang in the first few sips.  Palate:  Medium-full bodied.  Carbonation was spot on.  Finish  was very crisp and refreshing.  Alcohol left a warming sensation that coated my whole mouth.  Overall:  I havent had an Orval in many years.  Last time I had it, I wasnt really into beer yet and thought it was weird.  Weird is good!  What a fantastic beer.  Complex, balanced, and easy to drink.  A masterpiece.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","RagallachMC"

956,"2006-06-23",3.8,"Ive heard the phrase that ""Everyone will drink Orval...."" Now I know why.  The pour is a hazy nut-brown with a stucco-like head, almost clumping (beautiful!).  The nose is a dead ringer for Jägermeister (try picturing it next time, and see if its not bullseye).  Flavors are light, with clove oil essence, Allspice, cinammon, and a lemon-hopped bitterness that come together in nice, light medicinal tone.  There is a subliminal bitter finish, and the pseudo-numbing mouthfeel provides warmth and comfort.  Well done, and nicely well-rounded!","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"

956,"2006-06-02",5.0,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2007 Original rating: A step down from some of the other trappists only due to its ""less exciting"" style. Fantastic Belgian Ale, though. Poured a hazy unfiltered amber orange color with a head that made pouring the bottle a challenge. Aroma was somewhat floral and yeasty, but also citrusey. Flavor was mildly sour with grapes and apples, somewhat of a cross between a saison and a witbier. A nice lingering dry and bitter (hops and yeast) finish. Re-rate after at least two more separate experiences at the WIne Loft in Flagstaff, and another bottle at home: This sucker is a gem. The aroma is so complex and wild, tons of stuff going on, floral notes, a distinctive and unmistakeable grape touch, yeast, perfume (in an unoffensive way, though), just lots of stuff. The flavor is as complex, very drinkable, dry, acidic, funky, bitter, even fruity sweet in there too, just about any and everything a beer could deliver on, all melded together in a fashion that is delectable (I think thats the word, who cares if not, its just great). Not sure why I didnt re-rate this thing after my other two experiences, I guess I didnt realize how boring of a rating I had in here on this one. Great, Great, Great, stuff.","","User37895"

956,"2006-04-15",3.6,"Poured from bottle  into a humble shaker glass, this beer rebelled at such homely glassware and exacted its revenge by releasing a foamy yellowy-tan volcano.  The body was a hazy orange-brown with plenty of sediment swimming around.  Aroma was initially tart and fruity, but after sitting for a while, it had a bit of a horse-blanket smell added in.  My impression of the flavor was that it seemed earthy, with some sour notes thrown in too.  This beer was interesting and quite refreshing, but not overly appealing to me.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","Quixote18"

Crushed vitamin C and orange notes.  Smells almost like a medicine.  Lively, dry and sour with a lingering bitter finish.  I must say that I prefer a fresher Orval to a cellared one.

The flavor was on the spicy side  some clove, some cinnamon  with a peppery, mediciny tanginess at the finish. It presents both sweet and bitter from beginning to end. The alcohol was also obvious. Dry and bubbly reminiscent of the texture and sensation of champagne  though heavier in the body. Long finish.

More sweet fruit - grape, champagne like flavors.  Becomes watery near the finish.  Finishes sweet and dry, with almost a fake sugar (splenda) mouthfeel.  OK, but doesnt seem to be the same super-Belgian some of you others have drank.  Bad bottle perhaps?","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

956,"2006-03-26",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 13, 2008 Here I go again re-re-re-describing the Orval.  Just about every bottle I drink (and I drink a lot of that stuff) provides me with a different experience.  Both my mood and the age of the bottle can drastically alter the taste of this highly complex beer.  Unique yeast that is both classic belgian and full of Brettanomyces,  Very herbal with flowers nectar and fragrant.  Some bottles will also have a strong lilac taste.  Overall pretty dry and low sweetness but somehow packs in some candy flavours.  Very hoppy/bitter when young, mellows out a lot when aging.  Very floral hops.  With young bottles I also get quite a bit of pine tree.  Some dried fruits.  Lots of carbonation but never aggressive.  Spices sensation that seem to come from the unique yeast.  Some tartness that I can only described as pine tartness (if that makes any sense).  Its no surprise the Orval has over 1000 descriptions on this site and no two are the same.  Very complex beer that has been brewed the same way for a very very long time.  Was first brewed when the Dead Sea was only sick.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

956,"2006-03-22",3.7,"Pours a havy orange/amber color with a huge billowing head.  Aroma is of soap and yeast.  It is initially very dry on the palate with some very slight candied malt sweetness through the middle and a bitter dry soap finish.  A well crafted beer. Although all of the flavors produced are, when taken by themselves undesireable, this brew manges to create a finished prduct greater than the sum of its parts.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","entertheiceman"

Good farmhouse flavor with tons of funk and cheese.  Damn good with 5 years on it.  Im gonna go buy more if possible.  

This is a re-rate from about 3-4 years ago.  The pour is amazing-mostly clear deep gold body with lively carbonation and a huge thick cloudy white head and crazy lacing.  Aroma is loaded with brett, farmhouse, cobweb-muskty-like, spicy and phenolic, with a slight saltiness.  Flavor is also pretty complex, with lots of brett-like characteristics.  Slightly tart, bready malts, brett, wild yeast, spicy, musty, and hoppy finish.  Very smooth palate and easy drinking.

Taste is fairly complex: yeast, orange, a hint of hops balanced with a little malt, winter berries and clove. High carbonation. The finish is slightly medicinal with a herb edge (maybe corriander) and a little watery. Certainly quite enjoyable, and easily worth the 2.20 I paid for it.","Greater London, ENGLAND","dj"
956,"2006-03-17",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 12, 2007 Rerate:  Some raters think this is the quintissential beer, while others believe this is way overhyped.  I was in the overrated club, but thought Id give this a rerate to see if anything had changed.  Bubbly white head.  I do have to admit, the aroma on this beer is crazy good, so Ill bump that up to a 10.  Just a fruity bouquet...grape, sour, but also a flowery hoppy scent, unusual for a belgian style.  However, I taste carbonation, and a very dry aftertaste.  I believe that is where this beer falls short, the flavor just doesnt come out and capture you like some other belgians do.  Has a mediciney flavor that just isnt quite right.  I dont know, I like the hoppy dry finish, but the front side of this beer lacks.  BTW...this beer has aged for about a year and a half. <P>


First Rating:  Bottle.  Thick head...what a surprise to have that on a belgian ale.  Cloudy orange tint.  Fruity beer.  Peaches, orange, belgian candy.  Smooth but theres something a bit odd in the aftertaste.  This is why points were deducted in the palate category.  Not as good as Duvel, and no where near Rochefort Trappistes 10 or 8.  IMO this is overrated.  Aroma 8  Appearance 4 Flavor 7 Palate 3 Overall 15  Total 3.7","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
956,"2006-03-16",4.8,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2006 Bottled 16 marts 2004(10-5-9-4-19). Dark golden, with a huge head with big bubbles(cremier in the 6 month old); Incredibly deep and very complex nose that explodes of dry hop. It has a great fresh acidity and notes like lemon, grapefruit, citrus, hay, horse, yeast and, and, and, and it is even like you can smell the greatness of the carbonation from the head (fresher in the 6 month); The body is actually quite light, it is very well balanced with a nice acidity. The body aint as dry in a young Orval; It finishes of very bitter and extremely dry, with a lot of the same notes as the nose, the grapefruit steeps out a little more and malt appears. The finish is a little dusty. This is a great, great, great beer, I find it better and more intense when young, though. The rating (the numbers) is for a 6 month old Orval.","Aarhus, DENMARK","henrikb"

956,"2006-03-10",4.1,"Orval is a surprisingly excellent beer -- at least when you have it in Belgium.  It is a beer that suffers in long transit, so give it another chance, as fresh as you can get it, whenever you have a chance.  Spicy, grassy hop aromas are definitely present and immediately noticable as you pour this hazy, brown mixture into a glass and watch the big, off-white head dissipate into a beautiful lace.  Surprisingly, from the looks of it, the malt base is relatively simply with notes of caramel coming through from candi-sugar and nutty yeast aromas pleasantly wafting from the glass.  More hops.  The taste is nutty, caramelly, and refreshingly dry with, again, a spicy, earthy hop background.  Finishes very easy and has a wonderfully appropriate medium-full body and medium carbonation.  Delicious.","USA","smcd"

It had about an inch of creamy white head that settled down into a quarter inch of a chunky head before I started drinking it.  It smells like a lot other Belgium beers, you know spicy and fruity with a little malt.  So, the giant citrus blast I got when I tasted this was a shock.

This comes off more as a saison than a belgian ale, lots of warm citrus and yeast, opposed to the molasses and clove found in the other trappists.  This is good in its own right, no matter.  Flavor is malty initially, lots of caramel and sweet toast, followed by a massive, saison-like yeast riot, followed by a warm and mellow citric moment, then a warm, bitter alcohol note.

The nose is strongly sweet from the flavors of caramel and perhaps peaches mixed wth a light alcohol presence.  This beer tastes strongly of nearly british, caramel-tasting malts.  This is accompanied by a light spice and the smallest citrus presence - certainly more orange than lemon - and, wait, perhaps that caramel was more apple.

This does vary differently from the Trappist beers ive sampled.  It actually reminds me of a flemish sour in a way.  It pours blonde.  The flavor has a lot of fruit, apple cider, the middle has a sourness to it, then it has a smooth finish.  Its great!","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"

The flavor opens up the more I drink it.  Started off dry hopped, licorice roots, coriander, and peppers, almost intimidating.  Then the fruits started popping out more and more, earthy, banana and orange peal.  Finished dry with a complex lingering spiciness.  So much going on with this ale.","Elk Grove Village, Illinois, USA","chicagobears"

956,"2006-01-31",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2007 Bottle. (Bottling date 061121) Poured a bit too cold, with an almost clear, orange-golden body with lots of co2. The head is big, dense and beige, diminishing slightly. Leaves nice lacings. The aroma is the well-known fruity, sourish one, with spices, yeast and a touch of banana in the far back. I have a little problem with Orval I think. Sometimes, when Im in the mood for Orval, I really, really love it. Other times, like tonight, Im not sure. Off course its good, world class indeed, but it still dont reach me. Not only the aroma, but the whole experience. The flavor has its usual qualities, dry, fruity, dusty, yet sweet, with yeast, and spicyness playing a major part. Pale malt as well. Quite full-bodied, dryish and slightly sticky mouthfeel. The finish is long, with all the qualities from the aroma and initial flavor, and a distinct bitterness. What a beautiful beer. Pity it was not an Orval night for me. Seems I should have aimed for the dark side, and I think I will try to stay away if Im not in the mood. Still, rating: 7-4-8-4-16-3.9Bottled. (Bottled 040401) Golden/orange, lively beer with a huge, dense off-white head. Its so well carbonated, its hard to tell whether it is hazy or not. Fruity aroma with medicine-notes. Yeast and dried fruits can also be noticed. The medicine comes stronger in the flavor, but not in an unpleasant way. Malts, sugar, banana, spices and hops is also present. A little too lively in the mouth. Long, lightly astringent bitterness, and yet sweetness, along with alcohol in the finish. First time I tasted Orval, 10 years ago, was at a hotel in a small hamlet in the woods and valleys of the northern parts of Luxemburg. Had just finished a rabbit-dish, when me and my lager-drinking father-in-law had this.That was when he understood that beer is not only lagers and pils. It was a warm summer-evening and life was good. Thought it might suit well as rating number 400, as it is a nice beer with nice memories. (060131)","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

956,"2006-01-24",5.0,"This beer is amazing. It is a Trappist ale, brewed at the Brasserie dOrval by Trappist Monks in Belgium. Only seven breweries in the world have the right to call their beers Trappist(six in Belgium, one in Holland), Orval is one of the seven. Unlike other Trappist breweries that brew a few different beers(single, double, tripple), Orval brews only one beer. But, my oh my, what a beer! This beer is so special, that it has its own special malts, a maltster produces only for Orval. Seven yeast strains are used in this beer. It is bottled conditioned, Belgian candi sugar is added, and it can be laid down for years.  This beer has it all, it is amazingly complex and flavorful. 

This beer pours to a golden orange color with a thick, dense, creamy white head, and a very lively carbonation. The head is like whipped cream on this beer. The nose on this beer is stunning. Just a multitude of aromas. Very aromatic grassy hop aromas(Orval is dry hopped) mingle with peppery hints of alcoholic strength, sweet malt aroma, and Belgian yeastiness. It is that signature ""horse blanket"" aroma that is musty and leather like. The palate is rich and complex. Sweet malt flavors, raisin, a touch of fruit, and a rum like sweetness from the candi sugar coat the tongue. The body is big, slightly syrupy, lush and hefty. The finish starts malty, then ends with some really vibrant grassy hop bitterness. This is coupled with more of that good Belgian yeastiness, and a warming alcohol burn. Orval weight in at 6.9% abv. 

This a world class brew that is a must try for a serious beer lover. It is one of my all time favorite beers, I love the stuff. This beer can be found quite easily, but with it comes a price tag. This beer usually goes in stores for about $5 a bottle. Expect to pay $8-$10 for it in a beer bar.  I would match this beer with Belgian cuisine. Mussels and pomme frites would make an excellent match. I for one love to savor this beer, so I usually dont match it with food. Young Orval has a wonderful hop character. As it ages, the hops fade and more of the yeastiness, and malt sweetness come out in this beer. Serve it with some sharp cheeses, and crackers.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
956,"2006-01-24",3.9,"Hazy mahagony brown color with a very tall, soapy head.  The yeast flowed readily into the beer before clouding in beautiful smoky plumes and gradually dispersing evenly throughout.  Very earthy aromas of hay, banana, and caramel.

The head was strong but disappeared quickly before settling.  It was caramelly brown sitting in the glass.  The flavor was astonishly rich - first a bitter taste that goes into the nasal cavity, followed by a dry mixture of pears, chocolate and finally bread dough.  The finish was very smooth and dry.

Rather strange flavour, celery possibly, very complex. The vegetables, nutmeg and also five spice come to mind. But its also fresh and hoppy, a little salty and some seafood flavours possibly? Lastly, some perfume, makeup and soap flavours. Fairly high carbonation, but not too much at this alcohol level and temperature. Overall quite an unusual taste, one is enough for me.

I bought it froma fridge case at Latimer deli and had it in my fridge for a month.  This is not good though.  I must have got screwed, this cant be in the 98th percentile with 866 ratings if everyones tastes like mine did.  I agree with the guy who noted metal tastes and stale hops.

956,"2005-11-17",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2008 The 330 ml 07.10.04 bottle pours a cloudy light amber body reminiscent of cider with a large, rocky off-white head that leaves little lacing.  There is a robust floral hop aroma, with hint of orange rind and dry grass.  These same flavors are found in the beer itself, with the addition of spice flavors like clove.  This ale is decidedly carbonated, refreshing and superbly dry, from initial palate through the long lasting, high hop finish.  Very good.  (Also rated 12/21/08)","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ivan9856"

956,"2005-11-12",4.4,"This is a tremendous beer.  Perfectly dry and refreshing but with endless complexity.  I could drink this all day and find different flavors the whole time.  Pours hazy and redish like apple cider.  Nice big fluffy head with great intricate lacing.  Aroma is strongly floral; more like dried potpourri than fresh flowers, but very strong.  Also spices like ginger, clove and pepper in the nose as well as some fruit like apple and pear.  Aroma follows into the flavor.  Same floral, spice and fruit.  Some banana.  My one complaint is the mouthfeel.  It is a bit light and airy, not enough to sink my teeth into.  Overall, a nearly flawless beer.

Amber-orange, very clear as it had settled for months in my basement. Tall and creamy off-white head that slowly settles.  Flavors of celery, cherries, brown sugar and a hint of paper, roasted brown paper and a cola flavor.  Second half of the bottle has more barnyard flavor and the flavors seem brighter.  Lighter body, but not water at all and a very dry finish.  It is different, but I like it.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
956,"2005-11-07",4.9,"UPDATED: JAN 5, 2006 Bottle, and luckily I have an Orval Trappist glass to taste this with. Very floral aroma on first sniff, roses and carnations in particular. Some citrus aroma as well, I believe. Pours cloudy yellow brown, the color of dark caramel or toffee with some floaties. Generous white head that stays around for a good long while. Flavor is floral as well: rose water and malt and orange and pine, believe it or not. Delicious maltyness comes our even more as it warms. You can feel the alcohol in the throat and chest on the way down, warming the chest instead of the face for once.  Really excellent mouth feel. Has the thickness of a good porter (read: creamy), but with the dancy, twinkling carbonation of a well made pils.  Im only getting a little bit of hop bitterness in the finish, but plenty of floral hop character. Leaves a very consistent lace on the side of the glass. No doubt about it, you have to drink this slowly, or it will kick you in the face. The light hop bitterness builds exponentially with larger gulps or quicker sips, but who wants to drink a $5.50 bottle of beer fast anyway? Very pleasant  for fall and winter. Next time a wine drinker wants to give you guff, pass this their way. Makes most wine seem as complex as a crowbar. Strange and wonderful beer, brewed with the help of God, no doubt.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","FistFullOfCats"

956,"2005-10-21",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 12, 2007 Long have I sipped from an Orval glass.  Long have I placed that glass on an Orval coaster.  And long has it been since these surrogate replacements met their long lost bretheren: the beer itself.  It was about time I had formed the triumvirate, so to speak.  The reunion between the Orval beer and its accoutrements was significant in itself, but the Orval beer itself was a radically different and enlightening experience.  It was how I felt when I spent a semester in Japan; disparate, refreshing and engaging.  The beer is a mountainous wood color, kind of earthy, with a bumpy, off white foam.  There was a lot of lemon in the smell, but something else Im still having trouble putting into words.  When I smell Orval I smell stone and dirt, like the odor of ancient ruins.  I cant say why exactly, but the aroma of Orval brings me to the precipice of early civilization, around columns and through old markets.  Its a transcendental feeling.  The taste of Orval is citrusy and soapy, but like gourmet soap.  Were talking about sipping from the soap dispenser at a luxury 87th floor hotel in Monaco type of soapy taste.  This is no peasants soap; this is the stuff Kings wash their hands with when theyre done shaking hands with filthy philistines.  Also unexplainable is the galvanizing effect on my salivary glands.  Before drinking this beer and during it I was salivating like a hungry dog at a steakhouse.  I mean, Ive drooled copiously before, especially in sleep, but this was a dehydrating rate of salivation.  Overall, the Orval produced a distinguished flavor.  It is not the kind of taste I expect from Trappist, but a new flavor I hope to try again soon, if only from this singular source.  I also now know the worth of my branded beer equipment.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

I suppose I would characterize the aroma as floral and spicy, but I couldnt help but note the smell of cheap vinyl Ben Cooper costumes (which does not negatively impact either the aroma or taste).  Certainly not as sweet as other Trappist ales (although theres citrus and spices, not so much candi sugar) and definitely more hoppy.  Sour notes along the edges as well, not unlike, say, a lambic.  Slightly medicinal and bitter floral somewhere in the middle.  Drying charactistic persists long after the finish.

It has been years since my last Belgium Ale and it may be this style is not my cup of tea.  The spicy bitterness just did not do it for me.  The finish was long, bitter and alcoholic.  Carbonation was lively and overall the texture was dry yet creamy (can it be both?).","Chaska, Minnesota, USA","MrBrewski"
956,"2005-10-04",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 25, 2007 Bottle. Pours a golden copper with a pretty big white head. The aroma is very spicy: zest, raw cinnamon, lavender, witch hazel (the plant, not the astringent). The flavor is mega-spicy. It has everything listed in the aroma along with some notes of green wood and alcohol. This is a bit too spicy for me. Spice can be good, but here it overwhelms the beer character and seems like carbonated, alcoholic herbal tea. With food this would be good, perhaps paired with steak.

Addendum: after having tried several different bottles of this, it really does change with age. The bottle I rated was fresh; I far prefer it with some age on it. The brett comes through more and those unpleasant herbal tones fade out. Quite a good brew, actually, after all.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

956,"2005-08-10",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2005 Bottle (330ml).  At BeerBistro.   Poured a darkish amber-orange, very lively, with a huge slightly off-white rocky head.  Lovely lacing left behind on my goblet.  some very small white yeasties, but not a problem.  Aroma was of slightly sour wine, an abundance of sharp spices (coriander prominent), some sour apple, very yeasty and quite malt sweet - almost candyish, with a hint of pine resin floating around.  Taste was surprisingly tart, not quite sour, somewhat cidery, with the spices very much in evidence - not terribly sweet or malty, and with warming some citrus fruit bitterness settled out along with a surprising degree of alcohol-burn harshness for a 6.2%.  It also had the usual Belgian double ashy taste, which I quite like.  Mouthfeel was lively, carbonated and a bit acidic.  Im glad to report I enjoyed this - my first experiences with Orval were very positive, then I bought two at LCBO in January 2005 which tasted like an ashtray, but after this one Im sure those were the abberation.

956,"2005-07-15",3.4,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2007 Ive tried to enjoy Orval several times thinking there was something wrong with me. I thought perhaps the bottles I had were bad. I thought my palate might not have been mature enough. Ive tried to reason with the rampant praise of Orval fanatics, but I simply dont like Orval.

On my last tasting I found the appearance quite remarkable, I cant deny. As it warmed, the nose actually became enjoyable, with its slight lambic-like sourness. However, I just cant get in good terms with the flavor. The bitterness of the hops collides with the tart brett character and finishes with a surprising amount of alcohol. I cant help but grimace after each sip. Its a combination I would expect from an abrasive.

Reminds me of a brut champagne.  Full bodied with soft carbonation and a long, bitter, smoky finish.  I liked this one a lot and I agree with the general consensus that everyone should try this at least once.","Wisconsin, USA","twindadplus2"
956,"2005-07-09",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2006 Dark orange with a golden hue, a little misty. A solid and well-sized off-white head that laces wonderfully. Hops, in all their fullness, take over in the nose, which also detects geuze-like rancidity, lemon and wood along with just a hint of metal. Dry and bitter from head to toe (though mellower and juicier if young), bearing also some wild sourness. This hop festival does rest on a very convincing, juicy, malty body.

The following is a rating for a very old bottle, produced probably in the 1970s, or even earlier (according to the brewery in their reply to my e-mail). Obtained as a gift from friends: aroma 8, app. 4, flavour 8, palate 3, overall impression 16, total score 3.9 .


The bottle went psssssst when I opened it. Pours dark orange amber, slightly darker than young Orval, with a strong haze and a lot of tiny, dispersed yeast particles (I had kept the bottle in the horizontal position in the fridge for several days). Initially several millimetres of volatile, lacy, large bubbled head, which disappears within seconds giving it a quite lambiek-like appearance.


The aroma is also rather lambiek-like, dry and lactic acidic but softer, without the typical oude geuze rottenness and the oak wood notes. Also a rich flowery bouquet.


The resemblance to lambiek is at its strongest in the mouth: dry, acidic, light citrus touch, even the bitterness is like that weak one of aged hop flowers, only really expressed in the aftertaste (and this one is gentle, but sharp and long) as found there (rather than the typical Orval hop power). Only that heavy, old oak wood pungency is missing.


Light to medium body with a gentle, cuddly prickling sensation. When the bottom 2 cm or so are poured, the potion becomes very turbid and the colour turns much darker - light brown, like milk chocolate (or chocolate milk ); but still with a strong orange hue to it, without affecting the taste much - it just becomes somewhat (more) yeasty (surprise, surprise). All in all, still very drinkable. And very special.","Leuven, BELGIUM","schuimkroaat"

956,"2005-07-02",4.7,"The most ""exotic"" trappist ale and very different from the others. Orvals legendary bitterness is disliked by some, but is integral part of this beer from one of Belgiums oldest abbeys (history dating back to early 11th century).

956,"2005-06-30",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 3, 2006 Bottled - best before 14 July 09. Thick foamy head, almost like pouring champagne. Head was present for ages, and laced generously down the sides of the glass. Quite a peppery aroma, but I found it hard to distinguish much else apart from that and olives. Fairly medium bodied complex flavour that is reminiscent of drinking wine. Quite bitter, with a pleasant smoky aftertaste. I like it, but I think I need to compare it to a few others and maybe re-visit. (6 4 8 4 14)
Re-visit: This time I can easily pick out the hops in the dry, peppery aroma. In fact, they come across as very musky - quite unique (thats the yeast you dumb ass). With a best before date of 18 May 2009, this is a llittle further advanced than the last one I had, but it still seems a bit raw. I think Ill have to acquire some to cellar, and try them gradually in the coming years.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","bridge"

The hop flavor is rather subdued, probably from the brett as well as the alcohol (my bottle was cellared for two years accorinding to who I got it from).

Its totally a love or hate thing. Personally I think its fantastic. Magnificent slightly cloudy orange looks, the most orange coloured beer I have seen. Aroma is glorious; fruits and hops and lavender and something like baby sick but dont let that put you off. The palate is as good as anything I have tried. Simply prefect. Velvety and creamy with just the right amount of carbonation. The taste is all over the place, almost too much but just as you think that it mellows into something very refined and wonderfully complex. Zing zing citrus and fruity! Slightly sour and just a touch of alcohol. Never offensive but very strange stuff. I really do think it is an aquired taste. I hated the first bottle I had. But now my orval glass has seen much use. Really I dont have the vocabulary to do this justice. Wonderful stuff. If you dont like it drink some more!","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
956,"2005-05-23",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2006 (Bottle 33 cl) Since Orval tuned up the alcohol with 1% in 93 or 94 they unfortunately also started cutting some edges making the beer loose some character and a bit of hoppiness. Still I believe this is an outstanding world classic - although not a beer for everyone. Dark amber with a huge, fluffy head. But the sweet sensation in this is the extremely sophisticated spicing which is truly unique and unlike any other beer. 300493 & 050394","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"
956,"2005-05-22",3.4,"This is a tough one. After all of the glowing reviews I have read, I found the reality somewhat disappointing. Looks absolutely fantastic, glowing deep dark gold with a massive head, good retention, lacing, etc. Also smells promising, classic flowery, funky, dare I say ""horse-blanket"" aromas. Taste...well...the first disappointment. Dry then bitter, overwhelming anything else that might be present. I also found the palate a little watery, although there was plenty of carbonation, it was course rather than fine like some of the other Belgians I have enjoyed. Sorry, but while it is a good beer, I think it is unbalanced and over-rated.","Brisbane beer desert, AUSTRALIA","hefevice"

Sweet apple flavor initially with a pepper/clove bitter finish.  - Somewhat reminiscent of a spiced cider.  Pleasant and different. / 5 yr old bottle - a much more subtle beer - light sweetness, just kind of turned into a standard beer.

Spice and apples in the aroma which continue on into the flavor which has a light, crisp tartness akin to green apples.  Light body with very little bitterness and much less maltiness than expected.  A lighter belgian offering overall that is interesting and easy drinking.  Immediately recognizable as Belgian but not necassarily as trappist since is posesses a more singular, focused, flavor profile which in this case is refreshingly different.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

Tough to describe the taste as I have had nothing like it. Alternately sweet and bitter up front fading to a sour apple flavor. Yeasty but more than that it tastes bready like sourdough. Strong alcohol finish at times, warming in the throat. Full bodied but with light aftertastes.

956,"2005-05-08",4.1,"11.2oz bottle; bottled on 10.03.2004. Served at 53° in my NB worthy glass. I poured the first ~10oz to leave the yeast, per Michael Jacksons suggestion. The color is reddish orange with a 1"" billowy white head. The head leaves laces on the glass as it dissapates, but it dissapates rather slowly. The aroma is yeasty and bretty (barnyardy) with some bright citrus notes, maybe lemons. The taste is dry with prominent brettanomyces, giving it a leather and wool horse blanket flavor. There is some mild lemon flavor initially. The finish is dry and peppery, with some spiciness to it. The mouthfeel is dry, tart,  and refreshing, while still maintaining some body. When the last bit of beer is poured in, the color becomes a bit cloudy and the beer seems to have a softer feel and taste, the brett is still there, but the mildness of the yeast mellows it. Great beer, I think I will try newer and older versions. In MJs ""Great Beers of Belgium,"" he said the bretts and lemon comes around at around six months, before that the hop aroma and flavor is ""especially flowery, fruity, and refreshing."" At a year, it is described and ""dry and perfumy."" What a neat beer!","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Attractive dark orange in color, with a monstrous white head that falls eloquently.  Expressive, yeasty and hoppy nose, with hints of flowers, perfume and citrus fruits.  Flavor is extremely complex, bursting with citrus fruits, exploding with hop flavor, while remaining very funky, somewhat sour, full of horseblanket and wild yeast flavors.

Also got hints of sweet Marsala wine, pineapple, green apple, and bannana, phenominal  That spiciness carries on to the taste, along with some lemon zest, and tart fruit.  Bitterness is there but it isnt a overwhelming.  Nice dry, almost sour finish.  Very highly carbonated and feels nice in the mouth.

An excellent beer, with a nice floral aroma and dry, biting hops that dont overwhelm the drinker.  Lots of blunt sweetness going on, but it never turns cloying.  Hints of cinammon are evident with each passing sip.  Perhaps a bit of cherry/strawberry as well.   Nice, crisp palate and a well-rounded finish.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"

Aroma carries a strong incense character, as well as hints of fruit and spice.  Light hop bitterness and upfront tartness melt away to sweetness with flavors of incense, earth, banana, clove, lemon, light malt, herby hops.  Slight flavor of alcohol in the background.  All of the flavors are in very good balance, making it hard to pick them out individually.  This beer, to me, combines the best elements of sweet Belgian ales and bitter IPAs.  Excellent.","Michigan, USA","Incubus1981"

The taste is earthy, citrus, flowers, malts some corriander and other spices.  A lot going on with this one.  I can also taste peaches/pears and other sweet fruits.  On the palate this is fantastic.  So light and carbonated yet so complex.  Very sweet and tasty on your tongue.  Yet very dry on the finish.  So smooth.  Lots of flavor and so balanced this one is very tough to find fault with.

956,"2005-04-25",5.0,"As far as beers go, this is a masterpiece of artistic triumph. Complex, clean, complimentary and quenching. The history of the Abbaye DOrval is enough to give it fame, but the beer itself should make the Benedictine Monks of this Trappist monastery very proud. Tasted from the bottle, at the Belgian beer café, Perth (6.2%ABV Feb 03). Poured into its own glass (a little too cold, though), a lovely big fluffy beige head formed and clung like glue to the glass. The beer itself a hazy caramel orange. Sweet and generous citric, floral and acidic nose, very yeasty and balanced with biting spicy phenols. Fruits like peaches, mangoes and apricots mingled in the leafy and bitter hoppy aroma, as it warmed in my hands. Very little malt to be found, but just an absolutely lovely bouquet that followed through into the mouth. Extremely dry across the palate, biting but not puckering, clean and grassy. Low vanilla notes, but dominant hops push this to the background. Orange and lemon zest, mangoes, apricots and other fruity esters, and leafy herbs bounce around the mouth, and follow into the long quenching and bitter swallow.

956,"2005-03-30",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2010 It was a Wednesday night and as I cracked the bottle cap, the fruity alcoholic notes wafted by my nose. An exam and most of a week behind me, I was looking forward to this beer. Bottled on October 24th 2002, Im slightly concerned about this beers freshness, since it advertises only 6.9% alcohol. But, considering its bottle conditioned, Im not too worried. This beauty is pouring absolutely milky opalescent clear ruddy amber. The head froths tall, then subsides slowly, smearing the tulip glass with a sheen of sticky white head. A fine mist of sediment dances through the whole beer. I put my nose to the glass. Im blown away by fermented oranges that are swimming in alcohol, yeast, and light malt. An almost witbier aroma to this one. At my lips, this beer produces an unfamiliar experience. The flavors are foreign, mutations of previous experiences, lost lagers, ubiquitous pilsners, but a faint glimmer of that yeast in the bottom of the bottle. Its full of ethers and a good nose of grape. This beer has aged well, I think. As it warms, it produces this comforting mellow and mature bread like quality, with a nice wet sweet kiss of dried cherries and Madagascar vanilla. A light caramel is produced in the back of the throat, along with a flavor I cant put my finger on, but is familiar. There it is again. It reminds me of baking with my mother. I believe its light almonds, with fermented lemons. After swilling this beer down to the last third, it leaves a fantastic smack of dry oak and grape skin. This brew is a little harsh on the palate, but maintains smoothness. As well, Im feeling some strong sour notes on the back of my tongue. The alcohol scorches slightly as it moves towards the stomach and stings the nostrils, very slightly. Im surprised by the astounding complexity this beer maintains, even after half of it is gone. I always appreciate a culinary experience that reminds me of the past and this beer is no exception. Mid-1960s Bob Dylan makes a fantastic acoustic accompaniment.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

My suspicion is it has to do with improper handling somewhere in the trip from Belgium.  Fortunately even a ""bad"" bottle is quite good. A good bottle is pretty spectacular. 
Pours a hazy golden tan, thick white foam.  Aroma of yeast, pepper, orange rind, and hops - its loaded with spice and perfume.  Flavor is pepper, orange rind, some cinnamon, pine, and hoppy bitterness.  Long, dry, hoppy finish.  I love the mouthfeel - its absolutely perfect - somewhat fizzy, yet somehow thick and smooth at the same time.  Youll find some heavy cardboard/musty undertones in a bad bottle.

Consumed: July 2010
Not sure cellaring really worked on this occasion. Aroma is still a wonderful combination of sour fruits, pepper and old wood, but the palate has flattened somewhat leaving a base of mild pepper and slate. Quite fizzy, which perhaps suggests the beer is lively but in reality no really going anywhere.

Golden orange in colour, quite vibrant. Pours a big fizzy head. Very unique nose, massively herbally and peppery, strikes me as a Rhone syrah or a cool climate Australian shiraz (think Craiglee). I guess this is the hops at work. More herbal, leafy notes in the mouth, some pepper, very dry. I cant get over the Rhone characters - quite fascinating. Not all perfect through as the palate does lack some weight and sweetness, doesnt really penetrate on this front.  Even so, great beer to experience.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"

956,"2005-02-01",3.0,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2005 Im biased, and may have gotten a sub-optimal bottle.  (Bottled 1/28/03.)  Im an IPA junkie, and even managed to revel in Rochefort 10, but this didnt do much for my unquenched palate.  Lots of dryness, lots of bubbly carbonation making a bubbly, gassy feeling in lestomach.  Primo appearance, cross between foamy and bubbly, gets 5/5 just because it looks as good as those IPAs I give a 5/5 to.  I took this one in slowly to get it as it warms, and I succeeded only in getting a warmer dryness and bubbliness.  Still thin-and-lite feeling, very little of the complexity the sixth-sensers around here detect.  Perhaps even drier than British humor?  Is Withnail reallly nearly as funny as Lebowski?

(Maybe I didnt let it warm enough?  I only started to pick up hints of pleasant flavor at the very tail end of the glass.  Still, I had no such problem with Roche 10.  Maybe what flavor there was settled towards the bottom....)

Not for me at this point in time.  I tried to be as lenient in my ratings as my subjective enjoyment would allow, but it wont come out to the degree of reverence the consensus has given this one.  Reminds me of Ozu and Antonioni . . .","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

Big aromas abound; at first I thought this might be an infected bottle, then I relaxed and realized that it smelled very good, infected or not, so I was drinking it anyway.  Perfumey and citrus aromas with plenty of barnyard and horseblanket.  Its a bit like a flowery aged cheese -- and I recall the last time I thought the same thing, that beer was XX Bitter de Ranke.  The palate is round, full, coating, fluffy, soft.  Really one of the best mouthfeels of any beer; but then there is the finishing feel which is a bit burning and a lingering, persistent peppery spice not unlike the freshly perfumed nape of a new girlfriend.  Flavors are big and bold but meld perfectly.  The brew is much more bitter than expected, grassy...no...weedy, and very funky.

The first sip yanks you into another dimension, as it is not at all what you expect given the the aroma.  Very pronounced spicy, woody flavor, with medicinal herbs overlaying a smooth malt body.  Dry and bitter hop finish.  The flavors meld together seamlessly but each is quite intense.  Altogether quite an experience unlike any other beer.

The ale, to me, smells like woody sour cherries with a hint of mint and cardamom or corriander.  I think  the aroma is this ales best feature.  It sits fairly light on the pallete with fine carbonation that briefly stings the toungue.  This gives way to the pleasant mild dry hoppiness its known for.

Re-rate-  This is really unique I must say.  I appreciate it more now, but still there is a funky bitterness.  The cider taste is interesting.  Still just too sour for me.","Princeton, New Jersey, USA","wnhay"
956,"2004-11-24",4.7,"I realize I may have engaged in a self flagellating sin (and changed the taste of this saintly nectar) by serving in a vessel other than the Orval chalice (as demanded by the label)...but I was more concerned with getting a bottle that wasnt skunked from poor handling as I hear is so common...should be a moot point as the bottle date was 4 weeks ago. 

It poured into my tulip glass a murky honey-gold with a lovely frothy cap that laces wonderfully...This is a fine smelling brew with lots of complex aromas: Horse blanket, tangerines, medicine, perfume, walnuts...nice nose. 

Wow!! Creamy mouth feel...medicinal hopping that pilsners only WISH they could hold in balance with complex fruity spices and a heady nice malt wallop...all wrapped in this great funky yeast taste that defies description...the finish is mercifully slow so you can catch all the different tastes this brew has to depart....with a pleasant warming.

Beautiful orange colour that got cloudy near the top of the glass. Very lively and persistent carbonation. Taste... hoppy, slightly bready if I hold it in my mouth enough, spicy (coriander and more), maybe some fruity notes, and something I couldnt place that lingers (but not very noticably) both in the smell and in  the taste, I thought... aloe vera... but not sure now.

Dense frothy white head fed by an assault of tiny bubbles passing through a nourishing looking amber liquid. It passes quick and dry over the palate and I try to get the layers of flavors.

I found one year smoothed out the almost bandaid-like medicinal aroma and dryness. It made the brew subtler and more complex with sweeter notes of flavor blooming and cascading after each sip.

956,"2004-10-26",4.0,"Bottle. As this beer is bottle fermented, the liquid is a little cloudy.  The colour is peach, the medium-sized foam is made of big bubbles and it sinks down to a finger thick lid. 

The smell is a little on the sticky side  there are lots of aromatic hops here! I could also notice a clear flavour of fresh herbs, a little sour yeast and maybe a touch of sour cream. Complex stuff

The carbonation is very strong and bubbly with medium-sized bubbles.

The taste is also quite complex: The first rush of carbon dioxide is replaced by a varnishing bitter-sour flavour. Then, an almost murky taste that reminds me of an old dark rum emerges together with a full bouquet of fresh and bitter herbs: Thyme, wormwood, oregano, sage The aftertaste is a little more relaxed: some herbs, a little salt and maybe a touch of gravy (!) complement the fine ground bitterness.  

Indeed a great Trappist ale, my favourite in the style. It reminds a little of an unblended Geuze in the sour-bitter complexity.","Linköping, SWEDEN","bark"

956,"2004-09-30",4.3,"bottle 11.2 oz. Purchased @ Total Wine, Claymont, DE $5.99. Cloudy amber/orange w super off white head that was like rocky merangue on top of large bubble foam. Aroma is mezmerizing,  noticing a different aspect every time I sniff. Creamy light roasted malt, herbs & spices, light perfume and mild but fresh, clean, slightly skunky hops. Flavor is amazing. First there is a burst, followed by a short lull and rather thin mouthfeel then it snaps back followed by an unbelievely long complex finish. There is a short pulse of pronounced hop bitterness early on. Its like the flavors are each timed to do their thing then let the others take a turn.Very slight malt sweetness & also tart with a nice hop nip. Spicey, herbal, perfumey, with a slight touch of the belgian clove taste & a hint of fine cognac. On the low end of medium bodied, but then again medium bodied on the finish. Trying to describe it with finite characteristics would be like trying to describe the tastes of Drambuie or Benedictine. This is an example of something that could never be made in the USA.

Its loaded with dried fruits, fresh bananas, hops, and an every so slight alcohol aroma.  Mmmm... the taste.  Taste?  Umm, hello?  Where did it go?  This is possibly the first beer Ive had that looked and smelled fantastic, but just didnt taste like much of anything.  It had a slight alcoholic kick to it, but nothing else.  It felt like cream though, just wonderful.  Im very disappointed in the taste.  The bottle had aged for a year in not the best conditions; I will try a fresher or better aged bottle.

Re-Rating #1: February 11, 2005; Bottled on 10.03.04: The view and aroma were about the same this time around, plus some citrus tones.  The taste actually existed.  A verty strange mix of sweet pine resin, hops, alcohol and bread.  Very nice.  Its not the end-all-be-all, but a damn fine beer. 8/5/8/4/17

Copper color with a large head that quickly fades to nothing.  Aroma of barn, hay and lemon.  Very dry malt and wheat flavor.  Lots of hay, barn and mustiness.  A little raw grain.  Quite perfumy.  Can definitely taste the dry hopping.  Very bitter and earthy floral hits.  To me, it tasted like a solid saison, spiked with Brett.  Which I am incredibly sick of.  The bone dry barn with hints of ""Im going to taste like vomit in a few years"".  Halfway through the bottle, it just wasnt good any more.

I still smell something antiseptic, but now Im getting a faint mustiness (Saison-ish) as well. There is just something I dont know...like funky rubber and chemicals going on. Ive been aging some and keep having them to see when it will click, but it doesnt. The feel of the beer is excellent as is the appearance, but the flavor just doesnt click for me. Maybe is just needs to age before the flavor gets there...Ive always had relatively fresh bottles.

956,"2004-08-04",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2006 In the bottle. Giant mega-godzilla head of power. Best good head. Run for your lives, Orval is loose!!!! Incredible aroma of medicine smell. Way more bitter than any other Belgian that I have had. In fact, Im a little disappointed that the bitter flavor masks some of the complexities that struggle to break out. Palate that just blossoms in your mouth. Pretty cool shaped bottle for homebrewers. The lace was not just lace- it leaves white woolly worms on the side of the glass. Very distinctive.
UPDATE 6/5/6: In the bottle at the 2006 Huber Haus Belgian Trappist Ale Tasting. I think I like this even more than before. Pinkish yellow amber in color. Medium-sized off white head. This is a bronchodilating beer. Acidic sourness. Cloves. Earthy. Downright butt-like. Flavor has some amaretto in it. Sourness and tartness. Tastes a bit like Dr. Pepper. Multiple waves of flavor end with a strong bittering finish. This is like nothing else Ive ever tasted. A truly one-of-a-kind.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","SledgeJr"

956,"2004-07-20",4.7,"Bottleaged one year.  A vibrant ruby-orange ale that effortlessly produces a large, foamy head that lasts forever and leaves thick sheets of lace along the sides of the glass.  The aroma fills the air before you even get a chance to get your nose near the beer.  Intriguing and wonderfully funky aroma has notes of decaying leaves, wet wool, damp earth and moss, leather, and horseblanket, with another level of complexity added by a herbal character in which I detect sage and mint (and maybe some juniper, as well?).  The Goût dOrval reveals flavours that are earthy and leafy, salty, fruity, lightly acidic, citrusy, herbal, and hoppyall of them coming together to form a unique and complete whole.  I cant help but feel that Ive barely scratched the surface, for this is a truly remarkable beer.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Wheatsheaf"

Im not sure if I had a soapy glass or if the beer was just soapy, but the soap lasted throughout. Malt, some apple, metallic, a little lemon. Doesnt live up to its reputation.

After having more bottles, it wasn't a soapy glass. This beer just reminds me of soap. Stale hops. Nothing good. And yes, the beer was brewed less than a year ago and the best by date is years away, so it's fresh. It just doesn't do it for me.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
956,"2004-07-03",3.0,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2010 July 2002. Bottle. Beer with a huge reputation. I found a subtle citric fruit flavour which hovered around grapefruit, lemons and oranges, plenty of dry, hoppy bitterness, but little else. I know my taste inclines to sweeter beers, but I had expected something a bit more complex than this for such a highly rated beer. [2.5]   Oct 2003.  Perfumed and dry. [2.8]  July 2004. Bottle conditioned. BBE Dec 08 (bottled Dec. 03). Tried alongside Youngs Special London and Freeminers Waterloo.  Opens with a hiss. No movement of the beer. Very pleasant raisin fruit aroma - quite rich, yet delicate, sweet and a little bit like rum. The aroma is definitely the most attractive feature of this beer. Although some prickly metallic volatiles come through on pouring, the malt bread and raisins settle in quite early to be joined later on by a powerfully heady orange grove of exquisite freshness and fragrance. Later on some damp leather joins in. This aroma does decay toward the end of the glass to become quite rancid, like oily, raw, maggot infested meat dripped over with hot caramel. Nevertheless, it was the best part of the beer, and was the most interesting aroma of the three beers tried.  Colour is glowing amber copper, rather pale, with very tiny hardly noticeable bubbles. The head is three times the height of the beer, but settles leaving lacy rings into mixed foam and bubbles. Appearance was fairly even across all three beers, and once the Orval head had settled the difference was slight, though the pale colour didnt look as appealing as the Youngs London Special. Mouthfeel is initially generous and filling, moving to a gentle fade. Some slight prickles give an attractive edge. Pleasantly firm without being harsh or heavy. The Freeminer beer had the best mouthfeel by far, with the Youngs Special next, but the Orval was very decent. Alcohol can be detected at all times. The 6.2% is merely a guide-line, and mine was clearly heading up to the 7% mark or higher. The flavour doesnt match the promise and range of the aroma, but is pleasant with soft, delicate orange flowers and a very mild spiciness. Finish is weak with metallic notes and a touch of blood and bone. The up front flavours are best, middle is good, but the finish is too naked, sharp, unpleasant and fading.  An average appearance, unless short lived foam mountains turn you on, a great aroma, a decent quick grapefruit sweetness up front, but then its all about dryness and a chalky, metallic fading finish. However, each tasting produces a higher score than the last. [3.4]
Dec, 2010 A dry and unrewarding malt. Lots of integrated bitterness. Theres some sharp, citric fruit - like grapefruit. Theres a lingering chalkt dryness in the finish. Theres a lot of unrewarding and unpleasant aspects to this beer. I am not a fan of uncomfortable beers, or very sharp or very bitter beers, so I dont really like this. I try it now and again, and I give it a decent go. But its not my thing. [2.6]","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

956,"2004-06-22",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 10, 2008 Re-Rate. What a difference it makes having this in Belgium.  On my last trip there, I had a bottle of this with lunch at some random cafe off the square in Brussels (not listed in the Places section and not the type of place beer lovers search out).  It was just a normal bar, but they had Orval, and the bottle itself had some dust on it like they had been cellaring it for awhile.  The waiter/bartender was thrilled that someone ordered it.  In short: amazing.  Smells: brett, sour lime, a bit of white pepper; it was light, crisp, and playful in the nostrils.  Sour apples and yeast at first on the medium body with perfect carbonation.  Finish turned spicy, with corriander and noble hops still riding a last ditch fizziness and tickling the top of the tongue.  The acidity blended perfectly with the hops and the spices (not to mention the malt foundation that brought it all together on the same platform).  Feel was both dry and refreshing, being both something I wanted to sip and enjoy and something I wanted to drink to quench my thirst.  In all, this was like wonderfully spiced, dry and bitter grapefruit juice, but not like the grapefruit youll get in west-coast USA IPAs.  Hazy ruby orange in the glass with a creamy egg merengue head.  Now I get what all the fuss is about.  8/5/9/5/18

Original Rating. Bottle into Duvel tulip glass; bought at Binnys at Grand and Wells, 6/2004.  Great smell: Banana, apples, caramel, and some prickly alcohol.  Rocky white head was mostly lasting and huge (at least, it diminished very slowly).  When it got to manageable size, I could see that the lacing was gorgeous.  In the glass it was ruddy orange with visible yeast; great looking beer.  I was a bit disappointed with the taste.  I will admit that I probably started the beer when it was a bit too cold, because it got better as it warmed in the glass, but over all, I was expecting exceptional, and it was just really good.  It started out caramel apple with fizzy carbonation, with a weird spiciness that seemed like mint in the finish.  It wasnt creamy; tasted kind of like orange rinds; was light bodied and crisp; and there were dry hops on the finish.  As it got warmer, the carbonation wasnt as pronounced (which was nice, because it seemed too fizzy to begin with), and the hops became more prominent (which was good).  The same mintiness stayed.  Good Belgian ale, but not close to others Ive had.  8/5/7/3/16 = 3.9","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Dry, slightly malty and well hopped, the flavours breaking through the rather apparent alcohol are artificial cherry & orange. Slightly herbal. I really dont see what the fuss about this beer is, its quite good, but the flavours are all mishmashed and its not up to any of the other Trappists Ive tried (which is most of them).

Murky, cloudy, brown-tan colour with rocky off-white head that recedes slowly while lacing wonderfully. Initially malty, followed by assertive woody, bret character. Strong floral hop flavour and lasting bitterness in the finish and aftertaste. So balanced between tart bret/yeast and sweet malt. Body is lively yet extremely dry. Straight-up easy to drink. If I was celebrating a sacrament this would be the nectar of choice. Complex, challenging and ultimately fantastic.

It was a good beer, but I will never pay five dollars again for just 12 ounces of this.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","crzybob77"
956,"2004-04-22",2.9,"So far in my experience, this is a unique Belgian.  It has none of the characteristic sweetness and clove flavor.  Instead, it has a sour bitterness akin to a Lambic.  The aroma is similar to a white wine, but more sour.  This is classified with the trappists, but I can't see how they could be brewed from the same tradition.  Not really a beer to be enjoyed.","USA","orangelazarus"

It had a very dry flavor probably due to the presence of wheat. The belgian candy sugar influence is very subtle.  Well balanced in the malt and hop categories. The finish is dry and bitter Overall a teriffic beer. Just a litte more dry and watery than expected.","Warsaw, New York, USA","DrinkingbuddyD"
956,"2004-04-17",4.2,"Beautiful distinctive bottle, not unlike a bowing pin in shape.  Amber-orange and slightly hazy color with a towering foamy white head sticking way outside the goblet and forming a peak.  Insane level of carbonation keeps the head alive for a long time.  The aroma is hoppy with lots of musty smells underneath.  Taste is hoppy, acidic, and peppery.  I am drinking this a year after it was bottled.  At this point in time the beer is not very sweet or fruity.  Quite refreshing with a light mouthfeel, but with a satisfying punch.  I will have to get some fresh and see how it tastes at the time of bottling.  Since the bottle label says the beer is good three years after bottling, Ill have to see one after it gets fully attenuated as well.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

I wanted a special beer for this occasion, so I paid 5 bucks for a 12 ouncer of this one.  Gotta love those corrupt PA politicians!

I used a Duvel tulip glass (I know, I know, I don't have an Orval glass).  Pours great orange color, with a lot of carbonation and a HUGE foamy head.  The head on this beer is bigger than George W Bushes...and if I make a mistake on this rating, at least I will admit it.  Huge aroma here, apples, spice, fruit, banana, mead, earthy, chardonnay, cognac.  First taste is very dry, with hints of malt, hops, fruit, and spice.  Finishes smooth and very dry, with some bitter and fruit characteristics.  I like this beer, but I think it is somewhat overrated.  In fact, I can honestly say that it is NOT worth 5-6 bucks for a 12 oz. bottle.  On the other hand, I am rating it a 3.9, and that speaks for itself.  You cannot argue with this beer's complexity of aroma and flavor.  The bottle is cool, too.  I'm glad to add it to my bottle collection.

Nice balance during, but hops win out at the very end.  Soft carbonation,  fluffy on the palate, dry hoppy finish.  Unreal.  I can't beleive how long I waited to try this.

Beautiful hazy orange-amber with a creamy white head that shifts shapes deliciously as it tempts you. At first you think it should be classed a Flemish Ale, but then a touch of malt makes you reconsider.

It took several tastings of this beer for me to even get close to properly rating it. And even now I struggle to articulate my opinions and rating of this truly unique brew. Pours a bright orange and ruby color, with an enormous and persistant off-white head comprised of huge bubbles at first that give way to softer more delicate ones. This is the first 10 I've given for aroma, it's just so complex and potent; plenty of lambic qualities, flowers and raspberries, cake frosting, apple pie, more hops than average Belgian ale. And now for the flavor: intense bitterness, sharp acidity at times, white wine, malty rich, alcohol, warming, liveley carbonation; finish has peanuts(?!?!), completely dry.

956,"2004-04-05",3.4,"Another Trappiste which, in my opinion, has become less great in recent years.  A golden beer which still has a hopsack and horseblanket nose – very interesting.  The flavour seems less complex than it used to be, maybe a few of the layers have gone?

Orval has a nice, porous, tan head above a orangeish cloudy body (due to being bottled conditioned). An initial mustiness on the nose (almost as if you were in the very crypts of Orval) which quickly opens up to an attack of fruit on both the nose and palate (similar to a lambic but more suttle in power and complex in variety). Carbonation gives it a nice mouthfeel and a great finish. Definitely going to have this one again and push it on friends.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","MMM...Beer"

The head was like a soft serve ice cream cone.  Orval is so dry that the flavor just melts right into the finish.  To work this magic into 6.9 ABV is divine. 
Easily the most unique of the trappist beers.  Pours light amber with medium but fizzy head. Aroma is floral and earthy, with notes of peat and pine. The flavor (like a mossy grapefruit) is one of the few that I could pick blind every time.

Maybe too complex for my malty English ale loving palate. But this is definitely refreshing and eye opening to all true beer lovers out there. A must try. But I'm not sure I would drink very often.

956,"2004-01-10",5.0,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2007 Best before 21/11/2010... sampled at nearly two years old.  What can I say about this that hasnt been said already?  Beautiful burnished orange topped by a thick pillowy white head that lasts throughout the entire glass.  Heady cologne aroma, brett, perfume, orange peel, cedar/oaky woodiness and a fresh vanilla aroma as well.  Light floral flavour up front, soft woodiness and a fantastic herbal hop flavour.  Bone dry on the finish with a minerally flinty character that just makes the next sip that much more appealing.  Zippy, zesty, and completely intoxicating.  Its hard to imagine a beer that Id rather go for than this one, especially at this age.

Best before 11/04/2010... sampled at 1 year old.  Deep hazy orange colour with a thick pillowy white head.  Very persistent.  Beautiful nose, soft brett, perfumy floral hops hiding behind the gorgeous earthy/funky nose.  Leathery and horsey with light orange peel, spice and more lingering dustiness.  Warming brings out the brett and floral hop nose.  Flavour is awesome, straw/hay and a heavy brett/horsey aroma.  Very dry and perfumy flavour on the back.  A world classic.  Great at one year old.  I discover something new everytime I drink this beer.


Rerate: 33 cl bottle best before Nov, 2007.  What a difference a few months make.  Highly carbonated golden-orange colour with a thick lasting rocky head.  Cloudy.  Strong aromas of horseblanket and other barnyard aromas.  Sour lactic smell, leathery, woody, with spicy black pepper and some faint fruit underneath all of these.  The flavour seems to be more muted than the aroma would have led me to expect with leather, cigar, cologne and a bone-dry bitter finish.  As the beer warms the more wild flavours seem to drop out and more spicy fruity aromas and flavours come to the forefront.  Very complex and much more tasty than I originally gave it credit for.

Rating on January 10, 2004.  Clearly, this is one that people are divided on, but Ive got to say that I didnt like it.  It looks fantastic in the glass, orange-blonde colour, cloudy with a huge pillowy head.  Smells very peppery, spicy, and bitter.  It has a very strange peppery/herbal taste and a long skunky/moldy finish somewhat similar to blue cheese.  Has a very full body, basically dragging out the stanky taste with noticible alcohol.  I did not enjoy this one at all. 3/5/3/3/7","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

Unfortunately the beer list was not that great, so I kicked off with an Orval. It is a very distinctive orangey colour and is bottle conditioned, so pour carefully if you don't want the sediment. It is very hoppy and has a bitter current running through it, finishing with a touch of sourness. There is no noticeable sweetness.

956,"2003-12-14",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2003 The most distinctive of the Trappist beers, Orval is a complex adventure for the taste buds.  It pours orange and cloudy with a thick, long lasting beige head.  The aroma is a symphony of musty yeast, fruit and hops; the flavor has caramel and ripe fruit notes, along with a faint lambic quality from the addition of a bacterial culture.  The bittering is rather restrained, while the finish is more dry with some lingering hoppiness.

Sourish and very dry, medium-bodied palate with quite high, but soft and foamy carbonation. As the most challenging of the trappists, this one requires sort of growing into. At the first few times it may taste strange and too sour, but after tasting hundreds of other beers - and many, many Orvals - it just keeps getting better. Give this beer the right mood and temperature, and it will really flourish.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"

956,"2003-11-10",4.7,"UPDATED: JUN 28, 2006 The ultimate beer. My all-time favourite, though not necessarily the best beer Ive ever had. You can tell its special just by looking at it. The seductive bottle, the Art Deco label and cap, the glowing clear amber liquid with a steady stream of bubbles firmly holding up the most beautiful head in beer, with its uniquely dimpled pattern like the imprint of golf shoes on a green. As you approach the beer the smells of nature leap forth. Wildflowers, freshly-turned earth, field mushrooms, straw and long, uncut grass take you away to a mild summer afternoon in the country. When you finally tear yourself away to come to drink it youre met with a brief glimpse of firm, bready pale malts which is whisked away by a light and spritzy yeasty tartness. In turn, this character is also overtaken by the most delightful of long, herbaceous, dry and bitter finishes. River stones evoke the story of Countess Mathilda, and whilst theres no trout to be found, if there were it might be flavoured with the ample thyme and rosemary twigs. In the mouth it is full of energy. Soda water-style carbonation that in most others would be oppressive here delivers the flavours turbulently to all corners of the olfactory system. The assertive hop flavours are particularly enhanced.Despite all of this, the beauty of Orval lies in its humanity. The way every bottle tastes slightly different, the way it develops so profoundly over the first months of its life, and the way it grows old gracefully. Despite the brewerys modernisation, variability is still a reality. The lesser bottles are undoubtedly a disappointment, but like in life, the lows make the highs all the more sweet.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

956,"2003-11-04",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2004 Orval is always wonderfully complex and hoppy, and it did not disappoint this time.  This is a very unique beer brewed by some of those zany Belgian Trappist monks, and is loosely in the pale ale style; being pale, an ale and quite hoppy, including dry hopping.  At this point it leaves the standard pale ale road, among possible others, it is made using Brettanomyces yeast which add a complexity of flavor which I typically say adds a musty note.  At first thought this does not appear to be all that tasty (musty, horse blanket; I have some old leather shoes like that) but I feel that if done right over the correct amount of time it adds wonderful notes of complexity.  This beer does it correctly, and I always love being able to sample this wonderful beer.  

The beer pours a hazy copper-orange color, and is topped by a tan creamy head.  As I pour this beer the Brett character is immediately noticeable; aromas of musty cellars, and leather.  A sweet fruity aroma is here as well but the musty brett character dominates.  The beer is well carbonated.  It is lightly sweet up front, but only just as this is a dry beer.  Has a certain sharp dryness in the finish that is coupled with a funky-woody-musty character.  There is some residual hop character still here, though it is hard to separate it out.

This remains a challenging/ characterful brew on this side of the Atlantic.  When fresh it is quite a bit different; still good but in a fresh hoppy sort of way.  I love that the Belgians still embrace ornery ""spoilage"" organisms in their brews, it makes for a much more colorful world.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Anyway, I pored this nectar into a Chimay grail and I'm already impressed. The head forms beautifully, a light beige full creamy top that slowly fades to a nice medium head leaving some lacing.

How to describe the taste? Well... theres quite a hint of alcohol there despite a modest ABV compared to many abbey ales. Not inoffensive, I actually quite liked it. Otherwise I was somewhat surprised by a somewhat sour flavour, but the aftertaste was modest and bitter. If there's any disappointment then it's the modest body.

Still, a different abbey ale to the ones I've known and I'll probably have more of this once in a while.

Re-rate: It's a strange brew. Good but strange really. I think I'll try aging a few.
Re-re-rate? Well, really, this time I seem to have gotten a really good bottle and drank it at a proper temperature. Cracking brew.

I can see how it might put many off as just letting it warm a bit changed it so much for me. A bit brash and tart at first, but oh what lurks beneath. Hard not to keep from wondering if others cultivated yeast from this as the flavor reminds me of many others. Love the way it has an ever so slightly sweet reply to the dry/tart/bitterness.

Upon further warming comes the citrus - orange and lemon and fresh grass.If you take the time to enjoy the aroma of this one you won't be disappointed. Flavor is sour fruit and spice. Light maltiness. Very carbonated and big hops. Very dry and spicy. Hops lingers on the tongue with a tart apple residue. This beer defies typical classification for me.

Persimmon, orange blossom, minty, yeasty, and bandaid (I never understood what that meant until now) aroma, with a hint of homemade brown bread. Slightly candyish sweet, dry cereal, and slight salty initial flavour, building to a mediciny, perfumed, floral, dry hoppy bitter finish. Medium to full body, dry, refreshing, numbing (in a good way) mouthfeel. Fantastic. Brilliant. I had incredibly high expectations for this. Most of the time, that spells disappointment. But this was every bit as good as I expected and beyond. (10/5/9/5/19)
Re-rate, Dec. 14, 2004: After the first bottle (rated above) I was tempted to give it my first perfect 5, but something in the flavour held me back. Second bottle a few months later, seemed to have a little alcohol kick that made me think that 9/10 for flavour was about right. Third bottle another few months later I was tempted to up the rating but since bottle #2 wasnt quite there I hesitated. One small sample almost a year later and theres no doubt. If I was told I had to choose only one beer I could drink for the rest of my life, this would be it.","Halifax, Nova Scotia, CANADA","OKBeer"
956,"2003-09-25",3.7,"I continue my hike tthrough Belgium.
Let me start by saying that the Orval trappist is a fine beer. However, it's not my favorites of the Belgian pale ales/blondes. OK, let me also say that I appreciate the complexity of this beer. It's is an incredibly well-crafted brew that had be wondering how I was going to describe it.
Let's move on to the appearance and get to the flavor in a moment. the Orval poured a dark gold, darker than I was expecting. The head was massive in it's mass...rising slowly above the lrim of my glass. The head had a very long life, with the appearance of clouds as seen from above. The head melted like ice cream.
The aroma was full of citrus and floral. OK, now to the flavor.
More than any other Belgian I've had, the Orval reminded me the most of a dry white wine. I was struck by the similarity. However, it is far more complex than to call it wine-like. The combination of lemon plus bitter and floral hops results in an interesting flavor.
All in all, not my favorite Belgian, which surprised me given its reputation.","Addison, Texas, USA","kindestcut"
956,"2003-09-22",1.4,"UPDATED: SEP 23, 2003 After the initial taste, I had to go back and re-rate this beer. Maybe there was something wrong with this bottle, but there was a very unpleasantly bitter aftertaste that lasted a long time - one of the very few that I've poured out.","Jacksonville, Florida, USA","bob32256"
956,"2003-09-18",4.9,"UPDATED: OCT 8, 2007 2003 bottle  Pours a hazy apricot/orange.  Plenty of off-white foamy head.  Smells of straw, light orange peel, a little bit of baked brown bread.  Begins slightly muted. Hmmm, was expecting more of an explosion, this is certainly subtle, to say the least.  Dry flavor of hops and a touch of lemon and sugar.  Alcohol presents itself in a balanced way.  Finish is quite tart, but not overly acidic. Has some vanilla liqueur notes in the middle and is medium to full bodied with no wateriness, though the flavor does thin out somewhat.  This is a super dry beer.  If thats what they are looking to make, they did a damned fine job.  Perfect for what it is.  If I was in a relaxed, philosophical mood, I would drink this.  However, this beer needs something more to really make me want to go out of my way to drink it often.  Will definitely try again however to see if I can pick up some more flavors/nuances.
Rerate  WOW! Its not even that I appreciate it more this time, the bottle I got simply tastes better.  Wonderful spice with a slight orange zing to it.  Perfect balance and a nice slightly sour yeast finish.  Not nearly as dry as I remember, or perhaps, I just taste more flavor to counteract the dryness.  Hard to put words on it, just a true true beer flavor that is just right. Oh ya, incredible aroma.2 year old bottle sampled July 2004.  Everything to balance and perfection, just about.  Not much to complain about here.  Lovely grainy, yeasty and lightly fruity flavors, lots of it.  Palate is elegantly simple, yet has just enough texture to take in all of the nuances of this beer.  Aroma is still incredible.  Everyone I poured this for remarked how good it was, and all of them were swill drinkers who havent seen the light.Have been drinking this alot in Summer 2005.  Ive had it cold, chilled, warm, next day, straight from the bottle and all I can think of is how great it is and how deliciously quenching.  The tart brett and dry but substantial maltiness work excellently together and the wonderful farmy hops seal the deal.  Yep, its definitely one of the best beers being made right now.The more I have it I think two things: This stuff really does smell and taste perfect, BUT, the mouthfeel really is a little lacking on account of the filtration (despite being bottle conditioned afterwards).  I just dont think perfection in the beer world involves filtration.  Gotta stick to my beliefs!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

956,"2003-09-06",4.4,"Smells of banana and apple, maybe some citrus. After warming maybe 5 minutes smells of cinnamon & nutmeg. You can tell this has extra yeasts added for a second fermentation.

Previous rating.
Cloudy orange-amber body, tightly-bubbled yet short-lived head.  The nose features raspberries, followed by apricot and a warm spicy yeastiness.  The flavor is quite contrary to the aroma in that it is light and dry.  Starts with vinegar, dried wood, musty hops and finishes with some pale malt sweetness.  I found the dryness in the flavor to be sort of a tease - I enjoy that component of the flavor, but I would like more fuller sweetness elsewhere.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
956,"2003-09-02",3.6,"Cloudy amber with a yeasty, fruity aroma and a large bumpy and permanent head.  A musty quality is also present. Somewhat light tasting for a Trappist, it has an intense hoppy bitterness, with an overwhelming orange flavor but also some grapefruit, lemon, and a hint of cinnamon or nutmeg. There is no sweetness anywhere in the beer, which is why this was not of my favorite Belgians. Some malt flavor comes through, but not enough to provide a balance. The aftertaste was very pronounced- dry,tart, with a bitter, grapefruity, long-lasting flavor.","Clarksville, Tennessee, USA","Wiseblood"
956,"2003-08-21",4.1,"Bottled 10.2002. What a beautiful big beer! The aroma is pretty intense. Something like a horse barn and a grassy field. The flavor hits from several different angles at once.

956,"2003-08-21",3.4,"Oh, if this beer only tasted as good as it smelled!  I opened the bottle to be greeted by a rousing and complex array of floral and spicy aromas.  A wonderfully aromatic beer to be sure, much like the Corsendonk stuff.  But, alas, the flavor was nothing at all like the aroma.  Flavor was peppery and very dry, without the overwhelmingly pronounced floral and fruit influences so prevalent in the aroma. Mouthfeel like a brut champaign.","Dallas, Texas, USA","vector"
956,"2003-08-21",4.8,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2008 Rerate: 26/03/2008, bottled on 10/08/2006.  (1.5 years old)  Creamy, mountainous white head is well lasting above the blazing orange hued body.  Enticing aroma of cinnamon, sweet cream, pepper, leather and hay with a very spicy lemon and floral side.  Dry but bright flavour has the roundness of age without undue mustiness.  Dry and peppery like fine grain sandpaper and wool.  Yoghurt tartness emerges.  Light on the tongue with a slight numbing alcohol.  Almost airily creamy despite the weight.  Perfectly lively.  Moved from a 4.7 to a 4.8 by bumping the overall up one point.

Rerate: 20/10/2007, bottled on 06/02/2007.  (8 months old)  Cautiously exploring the far, dark depths of the beer shelves at my local grocer, I pulled out a couple of these somewhat aged gems.  Lets see how it goes...  The pre-pour aroma is promising--full of brettanomyces and winey notes.  A gentle pour reveals a beautifully carbonated rich amber hue, deep and cloudy, with a masively foamy cream coloured head.  Gorgeous interlacing of brett, toasted oak and Gewürztraminer in the intial aroma.  A slightly deeper investigation reveals bananas Foster, tart black cherries and a lush floral bouquet.  The flavour begins with wonderful balance between sweet banana bread, grapefruit juice and dry, spicy white wine.  Tannic oak, tart acids and snappy brett fill up midpalate.  Spicy, peppery and floral finale, drying out into long winey, oaky aftertaste with a quality alcohol retronasal.  Dried orange zest comes late to the party, but is an excellent and welcome addition.  Elegantly silky texture, dry and medium-light body--everything emphasized by a forceful, pinpoint carbonation.  A masterpiece, well beyond the quality of description Im capable of, but I try none the less.  33cl bottle, Duvel tulip.

Rerate: 10/10/2007, 33cl bottle, Leffe goblet, bottled on 07/05/2007.  (5 months old)  A frothy, cream coloured head of varying bubble sizes slowly descends on a hazy orange-amber body.  Vigorous carbonation soars upward through the deeply hued liquid.  Merely opening the bottle releases a strong, pleasant whiff of horse blanket.  Further inspection yields oak and maple hardwood alongside simmering potpourri of dried wood, cinnamon and sandalwood oil.  A vague rustic element makes me think of wandering through a dry autumnal forest, leaves crushing underneath, damp moss abundant on scattered rocks.  Sourdough bread slathered in rich Dijon mustard is also present.  I do remember other bottlings of Orval being more aromatically forceful, but the level of intrigue remains the same.  The initial flavour is quite bready, dry and tart with the zest of oranges and limes.  A little further back citric acidity intensifies and then fades to essential oils like sandalwood and lavender.  The finish is so very dry and firm, with a peppery and floral bite.  Potpourri hangs on seemingly forever in the aftertaste.    A svelte body, light to medium, with a silky mouthfeel and bristling, yet soft, carbonation.  Still quite a treat after all this time, though, I am perhaps slightly less enamoured with this particular bottling and the great presence oils herein.  Previous rating of 4.7 stands given the number of near perfect bottles Ive had since my last official rerate.

Rerate: 09/7/2006, bottled on 04/01/2006, Chimay chalice.  (7 months old)  While Ive had this several times since my original rating, I believe this will be my first official rerate.  A ruddy orange hue at the limits of the glass slowly deepens to a murky brown-red at the centre.  Creamy, large and slightly off-white, the head shows no intent of diminishing.  The aroma immediately comes to life and, like a cartoon mouse whacked by a hammer, scatters in every direction leaving me to chase it.  Soft fruit elements--pears, lemons, peaches--scurry off in one direction.  Hearty breads and warm spices (cardamom, ginger) in another.  Dry earth, wet leather and horseblanket cavort together.  Orange peel, roses, tulips and cucumber make for an interesting group.  As brilliantly deft and entertaining as a room full of cartoon mice could possible hope to be.  The flavour is very bready and citrus-zesty up front, flowing into an off-dry fruity and floral mid-palate, with strong spices and phenolics lingering throughout the long and dry finish.  Pinpoint carbonation and a velvety texture serve to make this treat even more drinkable.  Simply remarkable.  With different elements arriving at each sip, rating this beer is surely one of the silliest endeavours one can undertake.  Just try it for yourself, words will never do it justice.

33 cL bottle, tulip glass, 50 degrees.  Medium amber body comes with a large, white, frothy/fizzy head that is somewhat lasting.  Cookie, caramel malt.  Flowery, herby, slightly citric hops.  Leather, doughy yeast.  Wow...I know Im not understanding all the aromas here.  Sweet, bitter, dry, lambic-ie, all of these aromas in moderation.  I also can detect white wine, some spices, and a little alcohol.  Well, I tasted it, and now Im really confused.  Lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter flavour; moderately acidic, moderately bitter finish.  Light to medium body is dry yet also somewhat creamy.  Fizzy carbonation with a long finish.  The bottom line is: I feel dumber from trying to wrap my brain around this one.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"
956,"2003-08-20",2.9,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2004 A little bit of a disappointment with this beer.  It might be one of the most beloved here, but I have to agree with my Beer Guide and say that it is sort of musty perfumy.  Strong alcoholy, even thought its much weaker than other Belgians that I loved.   Incredibly dry and tough to finish.  The head was huge when I poured it, and it was really odd cologne tasting.  I didnt hate it, but Ive enjoyed other belgians much more.

Aroma is of sour apples with straw, grass, vegetal.  Flavor is a food sour with hops and straw, vegetal.  The alcohol also comes through in this one.  Like an apple cider with straw, hops.

The date of the bottle is 13/10/05 (Oct 13, 2005).  Aroma and flavor are amazing, like nothing I remember.  Sour, musty, cobwebs - I absolutely loved it!!  This beer is now one of my favorites.  I believe that the palate truly does change after awhile.  I didnt know what to expect the first time I tried it.  After having Cantillion 1900, I went in this time with that beer in mind.

In order to ensure the proper temperature, I used Newton's Law of Cooling to determine how long I should wait to drink it.  Pours a light copper color that appears darker at the top of the glass than at the bottom.  Big head necessitates pouring, waiting, then pouring more.  Good lacing all the way around the glass.  Bannana in the aroma, with a secondary smell below that, which I can't identify.  A different taste with each sip.  The flavor in the mouth constantly changes, even long after swallowing.  A lot of sweetness and sour notes as well.  Wonderful brew.","Auburndale, Massachusetts, USA","andy609"

10/13/06 re-rate:  Hazy peach color with a huge white head. Aroma is spicy and yeasty with hints of grape. Flavor starts sharply acidic and fruity with orange zest and finishes quite dry and bitter with a touch of saltiness. Medium bodied and creamy with lively carbonation.  Now one of my favorites.

I love the sexy pin-shaped bottle, the cool designer glass (not that I own one... yet!), and the perfect appearance of its shiny, slightly cloudy orange body sormounted by a tall, generous, fizzy off-white head. Aroma is slightly sweet, very yeasty and spicy. A mix of champagne, grapefruit and... well, horse blanket (thanks ecrvich)! Strong, complex taste: orange, a thin maltiness, a nice hoppy kick; bitter, sour, crisp. Extremely drinkable. Medium/full body. Long, acidic, dry, bitter finish.

While pouring the liquid, you come to understand what's with everyone talking about all the unique flowers in the aroma from this legendary trappist beer. Lilac is all over the place, your nose doesn't even have to be close to the nice graal-like glass. The numerous and regular bubbles escape relatively fast leaving just a perfect relatively small off-white head. The taste is very spicy with coriander, citrus and just so many I can't name.

Flavor is of oranges, lightly caramelized malt, and leathery wild yeast with a solid note of intoxicating solvent. Also, warm hop spice and flowers. Nice dryness and the palate is paradoxically oaky and oily at the same time. This beer is always challenging, interesting, and enjoyable. A classic.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"

956,"2003-07-04",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 8, 2008 POurs a hazy honey color with a very robust and foamy white head.  There appears to be a mildly citrus aroma.  This beer has lots of different things going on with it.    The start is kind of tart and acidic but the middle gets kind of sweet with citrus flavors, then it finishes reather bitter and dry--so dry it makes my mouth water.  The palate is rather carbonated and medium bodied.  A very interesting beer, but I am not so sure how much I’d drink this.

RERATE---i hafd this as my 80th beer overall which was about a year ago, and I think my palate was quite juvenile at the time, so I’m re-rating this bad boy.  This was bottled 20/01/04 so it is fairly new.  Has a fluffy white head and an interesting nose.  I smell sweetness, but maybe also some mint in there as well.  Raisins, yeasts in there as well.  Gorgeous nose.  I smell apples too...damn.  They are very right.  I agree this is a very dry beer that tastes a lot like a red wine.  Sour, hoppy, fruity, all is a mish-mash.   I will increase the flavor to a 7 from a 6, and I will increase the aroma from an 8 to a 10 as this a truly an amazing aroma.

------ Re-Rate.  6 month old bottle.  Above score reflects latest rating.  Aroma has plenty of brettanomyces present.  Acetic notes with some citric lemon notes and barnyard funk as well.  I also detect some banana bread in this with some light sweetness.  I forgot how funky this was.  Hazy amber body with a large off-white head that has some nice staying power.  Nutty, dusty, slightly roasty malt notes with some Brett yeast esters in there.  A little funky.  Not overly bitter or acetic.  This beer is fairly dry.  After the complexity of the aroma, this beer just seems pretty tame and a bit boring.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

I have had this beer twice and it does seem better the second time around but i really do not see why this belgian is any better than any other trappist.7/5/7/4/15.  5 year old bottle (best before 6/12/2006) graciously gifted by Willblake, thanks Jon.  Labeled 6.9%. Pours with a large head into my small tulip glass but the foam quicly dissipates into a strong lacing.  Color is deep amber, slight copper.  Lots of clarity surprisingly.  Aroma is nice sour brett with a slightly milky, earthier feel then I am used to.  Taste is very original, kind of earthy, toasty but with a slight overall belgian feel. Mouthfeel has nice lively carbonation with s spikey mouthfeel and a medium body.9/4/7/4/16  Notes from about 5 months ago, bottled on 31/01/2006 so it was about 8 months old at the time.  Poured into large rounded wine glass. Present brett out of the bottle, not overpowering, just tells you its there without being overarching.  Some tart cherry aroma.  Taste is very dry and slightly acidic.  Just a bit of bitterness in the end.9/3/7/3/16Almost an 8 year old bottle, best before 04/09/2005, label states 6.9%. the nose is so amazing, lots of brett but its not super strong or anything.  Pineapple, light orange, light spoiled citric fruit, and some other funk.  Still seems so fresh and the brett is not overbearing. There is kind of muskiness to it as well.  Taste is best ever with a light sweet mandarin, a very light fruit citric syrup. It finishes very dry and has a light pity citric funk. Leaves an awesome feel on the cheeks, tickles a bit yet just comforting light sweetness. This is the best bottle I have ever had.  I could guess it has some age just from the light spoiled fruit and syrup-like aspect flavor but it is still amazingly alive and funky. 10/4/8/4/17.
Overall: Funny early rating.  I liked the fruitiness present in the fresher bottle but I also like the strong brett that developed in the aged bottles.  Always a great aroma and everything seems to get better with age.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

(one of the first times I could derive this from scent).  The flavour is sour, not tart, but dry and sour (in a good way).  A bitterness overtakes the mouth shortly after the sourness subsides.

Deep honey coloured body with a super dense tan head. Aroma of wheat, sour grapes, hay, grass and some light honey too. Medium-bodied; Strong malty flavour body with a good deep spice and hop freshness, covered by a deep roasted sugar sweetness. Aftertaste stays strong - good sweetness and malt all flavoured by a still pungent metallic hop twang.

Bottle #1:
Slightly hazy appearance with colours ranging from bright orange to darker amber. Very thick head which is slightly tan coloured, but a definately great looking beer. Very normal smelling beer, somewhat reminiscent of a sour fruit. The flavour is very weak and quick. The beer is very carbonated but the aftertaste is very drying.

956,"2003-04-16",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2004 This is unlike any other beer I've ever had in my 17+ years of enjoying fine craft beer. The head on this beer is unbelievable. I poured this beer in it's dedicated Orval glass and drank it slowly which lasted about 20-30 minutes. The head stayed at a peak the entire duration and even after the last sip, it was still hanging on to the side of the chalice for it's dear life. The flavor was so unique and complex that it will most likely require several additional samplings to accurately define what I'm sensing. Burnt sugar, stale fruit, earthy malty taste. I don't know, perhaps my palate  doesn't possess the sophistication for this one. What I do know is that It was a most enjoyable if not a religious experience and I look forward to the next.

Perhaps it could help expedite the pouring process.  The anticipation builds... and builds...  and builds to a lumpy/rocky climax.  A soft caramel body.  Hazy and obviously well carbonated.  Citrucy, biting sour clean nose.  Spices and dry fruits.  Mediciney and almost like the dentists office, wierd.  Some woody notes in there as well.  Too sweet, citruce and astringent.  fairly acidic.  All that gives way to a faint, toasted barley flavor with some cardboard as well.  Very big in the mouth, clean but flavorfull finish.

A garden of flowers, walking past the heavily make-upped/perfumed cosmetic counter MILFs at the mall, thick sugar water, grapefruit rinds, pound cake, pizza crust, weeds.  Amazing. The taste is loose like a herd of mad-cow infected, ephedra-fed rodeo bulls revenging every slain cow in the history of Spain.  Huge rollercoaster of sweet and fruity bubbles.  Thick on my tongue, but dancing lightly and fizzily on the roof of my mouth.  Lighter fruits are syrupy... peach, lemon, while the plummy taste seems highly carbonated.

It pours with a hazy brownish-orange appearance and a huge head that gets a bit shorter, but stays throughout the drinking.  The aroma is quite spicy with a hint of sour apples - very interesting to say the least.  The taste is quite dry, but invigorating.  You can taste the hops and just about everything else about it.  It's very thick and not a beer that you can just chug (which is a good thing).  Overall, I enjoyed the beer, but to be honest, I've had better.","Orange, California, USA","Blake"

Start malt and lightly sweet, the top slim in feel on the palate, biting in its acidity, the hops perky in their spicy bite, the aftertaste quite dry and long lasting.

956,"2003-01-22",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 29, 2007 After staring at the bottle while purchasing 100 others I paid the $4.99 CDN for the 330ml bottle.  Big lasting head.  Magnificent may be the word, like whip cream on a latte.  Very strong distinctive, sinus-clearing aroma, hard to place (is it mint or mediciny?).  Slightly cloudy bronze colour.  Slightly medicine/alcohol taste at first.  Perfumy is correct for aroma and taste.  Flavour develops as you drink.  Peppery notes and others that are not easily identified. Absolutely distinct in flavour.  Dry.  A beer that needs multiple tastings to examine the depth of flavour but at $5 I could get a 750ml Unibroue.  Each sip tastes better than the last.

Magnificent head, large and slightly off-white with some of the largest lacing I've ever seen.  Some head was retained throughout.  Completely opaque in hazy burnt-orange hues.  My overwhelming sensation of aroma and flavor was to compare it to some very strong ciders I've had in the UK--citric, bitter, dry.  It changes in the mouth as it finishes, being initially very perfumy, then yeasty, then more earthy, then a bit metallic, then with a long bitterness setting in, with the recognition that there were surprisingly alcoholic notes in that 6.2%.  Still, very smooth.  I can't say upon finishing it that I felt a crying need for another one in the immediate future.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

A field of spring flowers with some pollen sweetness and a hint of citrus fruits in the aroma.  After trying to figure out all the flavors in this beer I think I may have come up with the recipe.  Take a handful of petals, and one tablespoon of pollen, a pinch of herbs and pine needles, mix with a couple of citrus zests.  Make sure to build this beer on some acidity but not too much and finish it on a well-balanced and everlasting bitterness.

or not.  who knows? 
original rating:
 it's it was with the greatest respect and humility that i approached this five dollar bottle of much celebrated brewing excellence.  it's lush golden pour the color of sun-kissed summer sand castles embroidered with battlements of foam and lace made an exceptional pour.  yet just a whiff told me that cats have been using this little sand box: it's odorific likeness to cat piss (or is it weasel musk?) is uncanny and unbearable.  among it's panoply of diverse aromas--good and bad-- are on one hand the distinct ammonia of a diaper pail, while on the other, an apologetic and mortified note of woody, cedar-like inscense.  it's so sad: that pretty half inch head just sits there, oblivious to the effluvia rising up around it, like a kitten on a backed-up gas station  toilet. a bitter rubbery green olive taste, with old burlap floor mats and the unsavory bitterness of a dill pickle left shriveled and drying for 3 months in a car's glove compartment. clearly this beer performed famously for countless tasters far more sophisticated than i, and i'll try it again certainly (when hell gets chilly) but for now, this fabled trout bearing it's golden ring was to me just a dead carp bloating on the beach.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

Either A)Orval is not a good beer or B) all of the bottles of Orval in town are somewhat if not compeletely stunked.  I had three in the past month.  All had a citrusy orange (vitamin C like) nose with a tart sour palate followed by a disgusting off tasting finish.  Even if this is a good beer, I would not give high marks just based on the fact I possibly had three stunked beer in a row, all from different stores.  Thanks but no thanks.  I may try again in Belgium and rerate, but for now, stick by this rating (rated 7). 

Update: This dark amber golden color brew exudes a nose of orange peel and something too mysterious for my senses.

Very dry aftertaste but kept me coming back for more. Overall very satisfying, but too expensive for me ($4.50 per 1/3 L). On a side note, there was a huge chunk of yeast at the bottom of mine, and it accidentally found it's way into my glass and then the whole thing was very undesirable.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"

Has a hazy orange colour and a huge impressive head. The sight of it reminds me of a wheat beer. The aroma has some similarities to wheat beer as well, but you instantly know, that its not. Very spicy aroma. The flavour is special. Coriander and elderflower is present and a powerful saltyness, that makes this beer quite special and different. The hoppy bitterness in the end is remarkabel. All in all this is one of the best beers ive tried, simply because it is so different to other beers ive come across. Ive visited this frequently over the past years, and the beer has become one of the regulars, always present in my fridge. Must say that this is beerart at its best.

Mulchy and fecal. This beer is dry and bitter. However, it looks very sweet and inviting. 

The head is very bulky and the color is auburn. It smells sweet, yet hides a pungent secret. 
On the palate its very raw and flat...reminds me of liqour. The aftertaste is like amonia. 

Drinking this beer was like drinking venom. Therefore, I could not finish the 
glass I had poured. Due to the beers strange character Ill probably be buying 
another soon. Afterall, its only $2 per bottle.

This aroma, however, is misleading, because this taste is very dry, with a bitter, citrus flavor that I, at first, found unenjoyable.  But, when I finally let the flavors settle into my palate, set aside my expectations, and tasted this beer for what it was, it was actually quite good.  I will probably buy it again, but at 4.99 for an 11.2 oz. bottle, it probably wont be very often.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
956,"2002-12-12",3.4,"Wow. What a dichotomy. Easily one of the most ""active"" beers Ive ever had. Popped the cap and sat the bottle down. When I looked at it a few minutes later a meringue-like foam had creeped up over the lip of the bottle. After pouringan incredible head arose, creamy and light. Leaving a thick lacing on the glass. The aroma was amazing. Fruity, sweet and full. Then I tasted it. Ooh fa. Hops. Hops hops and more hops. A fruity start gave way to a quick bitterness followed by a lingering, dry metallic flavor. A great beer if you are into the left coast style over over-hopping beer. However not so great if you like the malty-er beers.","Arizona, USA","TheTsunami"

956,"2002-12-07",4.5,"If you get it fresh this is one of the best Belgians out there. Blows away Chimay Red.  Orange marzipan and maybe THE BEST YEAST CULTURE in the ale industry. Unbelievable if it is not damaged by heat. Dont pour the yeast in the glass, thats for bottle fermentation. Check it out in the Spring or get a Fall shipment if you drink it stateside. The brewery date code is on the neck (11 02 2005) means it came out of the brewery Nov. 2 2000. If it has a bitter taste or uneven its because its been exposed to heat. At the brewery this stuff taste like orange blossom honey, but like Belhaven delicate tastes dont travel well. OUTSTANDING, probably the best ale from Belgium. WILD YEAST STRAIN is the secret!!!

I had a bad experience with this beer a while ago and knew something was amiss so I tried another one and hey, it comes as no surprise it is indeed a good beer. Very musky yeast bursting with sharp yeast and dried fruit. The finish lingers as long as any beer Ive had and there is only a hint of tinniness lingering in the background.  Very unique beer, and tasty. 12/05/02 - This IS intensely dry and aromatic. The bitterest Belgian beer Ive had to date. Wheres that distinctive Trappist malt I love so much? Great presentation but this is falling way flat on the flavor scale here. Citrus hops, thin body and bitter finish. Im wondering if this is part of a bad batch. Just no depth and this finish is getting more and more bitter the more I drink. Ill sign off now before it gets worse.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

956,"2002-11-30",4.4,"I think the reason this beer gets such high marks is not because its actually that good, but because its very distinct. Ive never had anything else like it. And because its so distinct, its also very memorable, and memories of other things will stick to it. Maybe you drank this for the first time at a wedding, or the day your first son was born. Whatever it was, the next time you taste it, all those memories will return vividly. Anyways, I thought this was good, but not perfect.

Hints of Tropical fruit, i.e. bananas, watermelon, guava, tart berries, carambola, and papaya with a touch of sweet-tarts candy. Very dry, as this brew sucks the moisture from the palate leaving a lingering fruitiness.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","Allseeingeye"

956,"2002-11-18",3.8,"The aroma was very pleasant with hints of sweetness and hoppiness, but truthfully the aroma and taste itself was very disappointing compared to some of its counterparts. The taste was very citrusy, mildly hoppy which caressed the tongue with minimal carbonation. The appearance was very appealing with head that you could balance a quarter on. Overall however it lacked something that i expected from such an expensive belgian dry to make it a spectacular beer. Definitely not something i would snub my nose at, but not a spectacular, distinguishing taste.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

956,"2002-11-18",3.9,"Third rating  That wonderful lasting this time more yellow than beige head. Belgian cow/horse barn, ripe silage yard, spicey ginger/corriander and celery aromas. More robust young citric spicey gingery flavours than I remember previously.
Second rating July 14 2002 4.0: Its the fourth one of these and its quite different again. This time I I got a faint fruity perfumed soap aroma and flavour. Majestic amber clear with a medium-small light tan head but no lace at all on the sides of the chalice. Light hops and yeasty woody aroma with hints of horse barn but still not that complex. Its definitely the lightest bodied of all the trappistes. Nicely balanced bitter sweet palate and loverly crisp clean bitter dry finish. But..... its still the poorest of the Trappistes. Picks up several points over my previous rating by being served in a quaint roadside cafe in the small Belgian town of Mol.

Now I experience the lemon, wood and hint of lactic sourness, ending with this incredible fullness: no particular note of flavor ringing out, rather, everything orchestrated perfectly.  Oh, and to describe the palate adequately would be to write paragraphs, and I would rather drink my Orval.  Awesome.  Old: 3.5I remember liking this one a bit more in the past.  My recent sample had one of the best noses in the game, but the flavor was dry and lacking.  If I can ever have it live up to the aroma, I'd have a major winner.

956,"2002-11-10",4.5,"At first taste, it was like the usual banana and spices and somewhat harsh. As it warmed up it turned into a different game altogether. The hop pressence (thats the best description i can procure) seeped through and mixed with the banana and spices for this unique experience.

I get Juicy Fruit gum in the aroma underneath which slinks a cigarette smoking man playing baseball with a big eraser in his pocket. To interpret that, underneath the juicy fruit smell and flavor was something that reminded me of cigarettes, wood, and pencil erasers (especially after youve just erased something.)","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

Lots of orange in the nose with a tangy must smell in the background.  The initial flavor is of orange rind that turns into an almost orange liquer sensation as it warms.  Almost fizzy on the tounge as you drink it.  I found an unplesant bitterness that mellowed as the beer warmed.  As I said in the tasting chat room, this is one of those beers that I didnt really like but I would suggest everyone try it once.  As said before, Ill try agian in a year and see if I like it better then.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

Phenomenally complex flavor: fruits including plums, grape, apples; woodiness; ever-changing flavor from start to finish.  ORIGINAL RATING: Beautiful, long-lasting head, which contrasts nicely with the amber beer.  Prominent grape in the smell and flavor as well as hints of some other fruits...plum, pears.

Its like a white cream cake from the top.  Very interesting aroma of flowers, hops, liquor, caramel, ... Lightly bitter initial flavour which becomes more bitter to the end with a lot of subtleness in it: nice complexity and balance.  Very enjoyable and still rather simple. 
People always laugh at me, when I say that according to me this (along with a good gueuze) is the perfect substitute for a pilsener, but I really mean that, because of it great taste and its rather low alcohol contents.","Aarschot, BELGIUM","diabel"

956,"2002-09-09",3.1,"""Cheap 70s cologne"" nails this stuff, Joe.  The perfumy aroma keeps going in the mouth, harsh and fiery and full of pine, yeast, lemon, and insect repellant.  Once and awhile a nice lighter, candy sweet malt flavour rises into the action, but mostly the thing is dominated by the rocket fuel burn of the opening perfume and overexcited carbonation.

Based on my previous rating, this is a different beast or my tastes have changed. Bottled 28.01.2003, nearly one year old. This has almost a geuze like nose. Hay, barnyard, tartness and a plethora of funkiness. I also have to add that there is a litterbox odor in this to make this go total Parliament Funkadelic in the aroma department. The best way to say it is, if someone handed me this without letting me know this was Orval, I'd think it was a geuze. There some fruit in the taste but an enhanced taste of the aroma as well.

956,"2002-09-04",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 22, 2013 One of my absolute favorites, i always have a few bottles of this at home. The yeast, the sourness, the hops its all just in perfect harmony, and that at only around 6%. Superb. Aging: Compared a fresh sample with 2 and 5 year old samples. In time, Orval seems to lose its bitterness, while the aroma becomes more sour. It becomes smoother, but less outspoken. I personally prefer a fresh bottle compared to the aged ones, although imho a 5 year old one is better than a two year old. Perhaps aging more than 5 years will make it better, but for the time being ill stick to drinking fresh ones :-).","Bussum, NETHERLANDS","jerohen"

Youre left with an enticing golden lake with a slightly frothy top. Then it starts, the light white cake like overture, the hops that lurk around the edges and tease without infringing.

956,"2002-08-26",4.4,"A truly fine beer.  Flowery almost sweet smell, full amber color, and extremely complex albeit extremely drinkable.  Typically I find that beers that are complex are not very drinkable (you can only have 1 or 2 in a sitting).  This simply isnt so with the Orval.  You could easily enjoy a dozen of them and not be sick of them.  On the other hand the flavor beautifully blends caramel, spice, citrus, and many other flavors.

A tantalizing, absolutely unique aroma:  fragrant perfume, oiled leather, very floral (roses, lilac) but not really fruity.  Honey and grain...what else?  I could sniff this beer for hours.  Has the flavor profile to match.  Prominently tannic, but with so many underlying subtleties.  Smooth malt pokes through from time to time, as gingerbread or apple.

This was the last bottle of Orval at the store, so I figured I had better grab it (not an old bottle, though - exp. 10/08/06). This definitely has nothing in common with the other Trappists that Ive tried, and the first few sips had me agreeing with the raters who disliked this one. It didnt get a whole lot better. Dry and thin (for a Trappist), and loaded with pepper and bitterness. Its probably an acquired taste - Ill try again when the store gets some more bottles. RERATE 4/2/02 (exp. 6/12/06): Not so peppery this time, and more drinkable. Bitter, bitter, bitter, and the dryness makes it seem rather thin. Leaves a slightly parched feeling in my mouth.

956,"2002-03-15",3.5,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2004 Re-rate (4/09/04): Always interesting to come back to something that knocked me over when I was a newbie after developing the palate.  Nose of sawdusty wheat, mold, alcohol, anise, citrus, and pepper.  Pours into my MIGHTY HAMM'S goblet a cloudy pale honey.  The short lived white foamy head has no lacing.  The flavor - though balanced - is thin;  starting sweet with a warm middle and finishes tart and peppery.  The medium dry body is fizzy and feels astringent.  Not bad, but certainly not all that.  [Origianal rate (3/15/02): 9 5 8 3 17 (4.2)].   A bottle of this was my introduction to trappist ale, I wasnt disappointed.  This brew
pours a hazy medium dark amber with tiny body particles.  The huge off-white creamy
rocky head is fully lasting with excellent lacing.  The fresh and highly complex nose is
fruity, spicy and earthy - with hints of straw, perfume, citrus, dough, plums, dates, cask
wood, coriander, clove, and pepper.  The heavy alcohol aroma dissipates if this brew is
allowed to breath for 5 or 10 minutes.  The taste is well balanced with a lightly acidic
bitter-sweet start and the average duration finish is the same.  I didn't get all the flavor that everyone else is talking about.  I'll have to try again at cellar temp and see if I get more umph. This brew has a smooth and
creamy dry medium body with soft carbonation that finishes moderately astringent.  I am
excited to try more fine brews from Belgium, but if the prices are similar to what I paid for
this one ($4.49 for a 11.2 oz bottle), I may have to get a second job.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"

956,"2002-03-06",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2015 Re-Rate, Dec 2003 - not to change the numbers, but I felt I needed to clarify why I like it so much (because I have just enough ego to believe that all of Ratebeer, nay, the entire online community is waiting for my opinion). Orval is a clear Orange with a thick, luxurious off white head. Smells of oak, pepper, and wine, as well as fruit (bananas) and Salt risen bread. Flavors are like an oaky merlot and strong black pepper, with some grainy, smoky flavors. It is inconsistant - which a huge part of its appeal, by the way - so different bottles will sometimes have a fruity, sweeter flavor and feel. Dry crisp hops throughtout, and finishes assertively. Unique and a joy everytime. Update 2/27/05 - Tried a bottle with a date of 4/97. It was still tasty, but the hop crispness was rather muted. Still big musty, fruity notes, and some medicianl flavors, too. Edit, 01/20/2015 - its perfect. I should give it a 5","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"

956,"2000-11-30",3.7,"A lot of anitcipation went into drinking this beer.  I went to the Orval website and read the history of the monastary and the beer.  I have heard a lot about how great Belgian beers are and in general I tend to agree.  This is a fairly strong ale (6.9%), it has a light color and is pretty milky.  It throws a mean head, no matter how gently you pour.  The first thing I noticed was the citrus/fruity aroma.  Not a bad smell, but not what I had anticipated.  This is a pretty good beer, but not as great as Id hoped.  For the money, there are a lot of others Id rather drink.  This beer is quite similar to the Piraat Ale I had not too long ago.","Sandy, Utah, USA","opiate"

956,"2000-10-03",3.5,"I agree with PhillyBeer2112: This beer was a major disappointment.
Maybe Ive had some poorly handled bottles, but this beer is not worth $3.99 per 11.2 oz.","Leonia, New Jersey, USA","kenk99"
