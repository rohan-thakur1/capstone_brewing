1769,"2016-09-05",4.0,"Picked up a single 12-oz bottle from Rileys Wines of the World in Madison, Wisconsin. Pours a semi-clear copper dark amber colored brew with an average sized off-white head that slowly dissipates and leaves behind some spotty lacing. Aroma of roasted nuts, earthy hops, some light chocolate and a touch of dark pitted fruits. Taste is medium bodied, very soft carbonation with flavors of sweet dark bread dough, a hint of toffee, caramel and floral hops. Finish is extremely smooth, very short roasted brown malt, a little milk chocolate and then a clean finish. I definitely have a craving for a chimichanga with rice and pork all the sudden.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
1769,"2016-09-05",2.9,"355ml bottle. Well, its a ""mexican style"" lager done to a t, not sure why someone would want to recreate one but they have done that here.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
1769,"2016-08-14",3.7,"Brown amber. Nose of light toasted malt and fruit with a touch of cocoa roast. Flavor is light biscuity cocoa with more fruity toasted malt. Lingering mild dry roast. Tasty dunkel/schwarz-ish beer.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
1769,"2016-06-13",3.4,"Dark walnut color with a firm light tan head. Nutty, coffee aroma with a bit of malt sweetness. Light sweet doughy malt with a bit of roasted flavor in the background. Lightly creamy palate with a light but noticeable tingle of carbonation and a quick malty finish. This is a nice one, smooth and easy drinking that really puts the malt out front..","Wisconsin, USA","twindadplus2"
1769,"2016-06-10",3.8,"What I always hope a Negra Modelo will taste like -- and it never does. Smooth, sweet with an aroma of caramel and freshly baked bread. Quite a solid brew. Enjoyed from the bottle.",".08 Junction, Wisconsin, USA","mrjaxson"
1769,"2016-05-27",3.2,"12oz bottle from the Malt Shoppe in Tosa. Golden brown pour with little head. Nose has sweet malts with a bit of fruit. Taste is of sweet malts, slightly bitter, and a touch of basement. Overall not bad. 13","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"
1769,"2016-05-21",3.7,"12oz bottle. Pretty enjoyable beer, though I would classify it more along the lines of a Dunkel. Creamy caramel malts, really rides the malts, which is nice, because it makes it that much better than the beers it stylistically tributes. Easy medium body. Pleasant, solid offering.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
1769,"2016-05-05",2.9,"Bottle. Dark brown with white head. Some burnt sugar in the nose. Not as malty or hoppy as expected. Very much like the dark version of Negra Modelo. Probably better though.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","pkbites"
