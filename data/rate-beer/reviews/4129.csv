4129,"2017-03-25",2.9,"2017 release, on tap. Aroma is very floral, I got bourbon right after the pour but it seems to have dissipated greatly after sitting in the glass. Brilliantly clear, nice bright yellow color. None of the ingredients really steal the show on the tongue, its fairly balanced in that regard, but the flavors seem very subdued. It is a bit watery, and seemingly dryer than my memory of previous versions. More acidic than expected as well. Also, theres a bit of astringency coming through, likely from the pecans im guessing. Would like to see the next batch a touch sweeter, and with more flavor contribution from the nuts and spices.","","BrandNewBrew"

>>> Disappointing mead considering the sky high ratings. Interesting French Toast aroma, but something was clearly wrong with the taste (acidic) / palate (carbonated). 

+  Aroma is enticing (though its borderline artificial) with cinnammon, nutmeg, vanilla, bourbon, banana and alcohol all expressing them in a rather cohesive ""bouquet""
+  The alcohol warmth in the finish is well dosed, enough to tone down the flavors and not enough to burn 
−  The color (coconut water - yellow) and the haziness arent so pretty 
−  Theres a tiny bit of carbonation (quickly gone) that isnt meant to be there and definitely hinders the depth and the sweetness impression of this one 
−  Theres a weird acidity in the taste

Taste is honey, oak, light sourness, with a dry boozy finish. Ill be honest, I dont get much in the way of french toast or maple, I get lots of honey, oak, and a hint of odd sourness.

4129,"2015-01-10",4.7,"375 ml bottle at home. Pours clear light golden, no head, no carbo.

Two aromas lead the dance: cinnamon and thick honey, supported by a buttery flowery scent, a tad of alccohol in the nose, the wine touch makes one think of glühwein as well (the reference is interesting, but glühwein is crap), etc. One of the most beautiful bouquets ever found in a mead (although I havent tasted a lot of m yet).

Pours a still, clear golden body revealing a thick coating as the glass tilts from side to side. Aroma is ridiculous: at first it starts out with a rich toasted honey flavor, but as the mead warms, the banana and vanilla flavors really come out; coupled with the toasted character and you get an insanely rich, french toast-like nose. Mouthfeel is rich but not as rich as the aroma lets on to be - essentially tastes like a really nice, quality honey mead. I keep going back to just inhaling the nose as it continues to open with flavors of cinnamon, rich pastry, melted banana pie, vanilla, maple and spices. I swear you can almost get an almost toasted bread-y, egg-badder character singular to that breakfast/brunch platter of french toast.

4129,"2013-12-30",4.2,"In short: A very toasted mead with unique flavors that defies categories.
How: Bottle shared by my man Kyle at post HF FoFA 2013 party.
The look: Clear yellow body with no head (looks like a mead which means looks like a white wine).
In long: The strong nose is unique and hard to describe. It is toasted honey (if such a thing even existed), hazelnuts, dried banana peels, toasted pastry. Ive never smelled a mead so toasted and it is quite inviting. In mouth it is a mead, it is very thick but maybe a little less sticky-syrupy than typical meads. Taste is very unique. Maybe Im easily manipulated by drink names, but I swear I tasted french toasts, freshly pan-fried french toasts, unreal. Also vanilla, hazelnuts, toasted waffles, toasted bananas, only mild spicy notes. Surprisingly not a strong honey flavor in this mead. Finish is somewhat toasty dry (yes, a 15%-ish mead with a dry finish!!!). My first Wow mead, this one deserves the hype, very unique and immensely enjoyable. So Im gonna go on and say like everybody else and say this mead is awesome, but Im easily manipulated, after I wash my pants with my new detergent I think they smell Fresh Tidal Wave.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

There is a lovely bready, mapley, syrupy, cinnamon aroma to this thing. Its got hints of banana, and a beautiful nuttiness. The cinnamon is what seems to dominate as cinnamon tends to do. The flavor is much of the same. Aside from it being a cold liquid, one could be fooled into thinking they had just enjoyed a delightful stack of French toast. I wish the cinnamon wasnt so dominant, but its hard to work with... And, the 14.5% alcohol is completely undetectable. This is just incredible!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

I detect mostly cinnamon and nutmeg, but there could be several others. Taste is absolutely amazing. Nutty, spicy, and definitely French toast. Best mead I have had.

Nose is heavenly, I can pick out the cinnamon, maple syrup, doughiness of the French toast, and some underlying vanilla bean. It is basically perfect. I get a lot of similar themes that I get in the nose, but a little less pronounced. There is also a little sourness on the front end that Im not sure I understand. I didnt taste this when I previously had it, but my palate just may be a little shot. Mouthfeel is lighter and a little syrupy, with no carbonation, and a moderate finish.

The french toast flavor stays with you a very long time.  I gotta say though, I think I might actually like this better without the bourbon aging.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"

4129,"2013-03-31",3.9,"Via trade with Gunson.  The aroma is intriguing, like bready, hazelnuts, banana, maple syrup, cinnamon.  It smells vaguely like french toast.   Some boozy aromas, but hardly overpowering.  The appearance is clear gold, like apple juice, a thin white head which vanishes quickly.  The flavor is honey, some bourbon, bananas, sweeter and more boozy than the aroma, but less complex.  The finish is sweet, honey, followed with a bourbon burn.  Pretty thin in body.  Unusual beverage, but enjoyable.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
4129,"2013-03-20",4.2,"This one poured a still golden yellow with just very slight bubbles from the poured.  Aroma was boom in your face of honey, booze, maple and bananas.  Flavor was sticky sweet but not over the top, light vanilla cake batter, honey, dough, bananas, maple, and butter but not in a diacetyl way. Definitely my favorite mead, but a bit disappointing given some of the descriptions ive read before.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
4129,"2013-03-17",3.5,"lightly hazed golden straw body with thick sheet legs.  it does have a very powerful aroma that is close to french toast and sugared waffles and almond pastries (something about the waffle breakfast cereal from my childhood), but the nose is both musty (yeasty and dirty) and the honey expression seems to offset the maple syrup, banana, nuts and spices enough. sweet taste, medium-high body, medium acid, some hot alcohols and some light harshness in the finish.  a fun mead with a lot going on but not all of it working in balance.  the oak seems to have dirtied the nose a bit and the bananas arent noticeable through the haze of nuts, spices, oak and maple syrup.  not bad, and I would probably enjoy it more on its own, but against a lot of cleaner meads these flaws are pretty evident.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Bottle:  The aroma consists of banana, vanilla, butter, syrup, and light alcohol.  One of the best smelling ""beers"" Ive had in a long time.  It pours a transparent gold with a few bubbles that eventually fade leaving the liquid look still.  A swirl leaves some sticky legs on the sides of the glass.  The flavor starts with moderate banana, vanilla, and the slightest hint of apple.  The finish has maple syrup, a touch of butter, and alcohol.  Its medium bodied with minimal carbonation.  Overall, its crazy how they got the butter flavor in there to actually make it taste like French toast.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

Taste was sugary sweet with a slight maple syrup and carmelized bananana.  This was actually my first mead experience, hopefully its not all down hill from here as this was exceptional.  Still has not swayed me for my love of sours, as the sweetness was slightly more than i could stomach if drinking more than 4oz.","NYC, New York, USA","Godofthecellar"

Sweet honey on the palate gives way to bananas and vanilla. Banana really shines towards the end, and I swear theres maple syrup in the aftertaste as it descends. Cinnamon clings to the back of my throat. Mildly boozy. In a word? Transcendent. Need moar!","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"

The taste is smooth goodness with a pleasing toastiness that runs straight toward being roasty as well as rich honey sweetness, a maple syrup like note, a bit of banana and sweet vanilla.

A tad flowery and slightly spicy midsection before running off towards a moderately boozy, umani savory finish. Insanely complex, massive sweetness, and everything you would want in a dessert mead.

4129,"2010-11-13",4.1,"Holy shit! The aroma on this is sexy as hell! Bananas, almond crème, marzipan, some lighter cinnamon, and well fucking French toast! The alcohol is barely noticeable. Smells absolutely artificial, but its so goddamn aromatic. Pours thick, viscous and oily. Looks like a fat, buttery Cali Chardonnay in the glass. Flavor does not quite live up to the awesomeness of the aroma. Not nearly as syrupy sweet as the aroma suggests. There are flavors of almonds, bananas, a good dose of drying wood tannin, French toast batter. Fairly well attenuated all things considered. The alcohol is fairly prevalent, but not too overpowering. Fairly full bodied, syrupy and viscous but never becomes cloying. Fun, fun stuff. Thanks Jonathan!","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
4129,"2010-10-28",4.5,"Pours pale bright golden with no head. Huge nose and flavor of ammeretto, vanilla, banana. Smooth palate and finish. Legs flow down the glass like a 15% Chardonnay.","SF Bay Area, California, USA","AgentSteve"
4129,"2010-10-15",3.9,"Nip bottle, courtesy of a friend. Thanks!! Pours a  deep, golden color; nice long legs; headless. This is hugely aromatic and generous in the glass: notes of almonds, amaretto, and a light dose of cinnamon; rich nuttiness, vanilla, and tons of oxidative qualities here; I cant tell whether some of these notes are well-handled oxidation or additions, but theyre hugely developed; part of one of the most unique and engaging aromas Ive enjoyed in some time; honestly, this mead was worth it just for the aroma (and Id be damn curious to know how they did this...). Hugely full mouthfeel, coating the palate; still; some warmth coming through, most definitely but nothing abrasive; the bourbon barrel comes through much more strongly in the mouth, paired with a hefty amount of alcohol thats well-integrated, certainly, but still quite prominent and more than Id prefer (it distracts a touch from some of the more subtle notes); beyond that, though, the alcohol subsides after the first few sips, and the same almond-y and amaretto-like notes play out beautifully here: lots of vanilla and nuttiness, certainly honey, and a light accompaniment of cinnamon; lightly spicy, hugely generous throughout, and (thankfully and somewhat surprisingly) never burdeningly sweet or cloying. Beautifully done, if just a touch overbearing in the mouth, for me (and I have a feeling that some folks sensitive to oxidation will have some negative reactions here). The finish is reasonably sweet, showing amaretto, almonds, and light spice.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
4129,"2010-09-20",4.5,"Thanks to Dean for sharing. Fucking amazing. Arouma is artful. Cinnamon, maple syrup, super aroumatic. Each little sniff is like an exploration of a complex sugarscape...a perfect palate as well. Smooth and glasslike. savory fruits, honey nectar, sweet open flavors, continues with honey, and cinnamon. savory maple and honey notes. Finishes with a touch of warm alcohol. Best mead Ive ever had, by a long shot.","New York, New York, USA","zdk"
4129,"2010-09-11",4.6,"Huge thanks to daknole!! Bottle pours gold.  Aroma is sweet with banana bread, honey, caramel, and roasted pecans.  This is one of THE most unique things I have ever smelled.  Flavor doesnt quite live up to the smell but they definately named this one appropriately.  Im glad I had the opportunity to taste this.","Portland, Oregon, USA","dionysus"
4129,"2010-09-06",4.7,"Wow.  Bulldog04 is the man.  Yellow pour. Aroma is laden with bruleed bananas, honey, caramel, and honey.  Flavor is sweet with some banana, walnuts, caramel, maple, baklava.  One of the most uniqe beverages I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
4129,"2010-09-01",4.7,"BottleRBSG 2010 This mead rocks! Clear golden mead with fantastic, centipede-like legs. I cannot put into words how good this smells, but its one of the best smelling things ever. I would like to have a Yankee Candle that smells like this. Well, I guess Ill give it a shot: Im picking up a medley of Amaretto, deep fried banana/cinnamon bread, vanilla, pralines and all other things rich, decadent and sweet. Full-bodied and oily with no carbonation. The alcohol is nearly transparent - doesnt taste like its over 7% ABV. The flavor is nearly as pleasurable as the aroma  buttery fried toast, vanilla and a wealth of hearty, dark, tropical blossoms honey. The finish is simply a continuation and then slow fade of the plush, luxuriant flavor. World class mead!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

4129,"2010-07-27",5.0,"Bottle labeled Bourbon Barrel BFTM.  Pours a thick golden straw.  Nose has honey, tropical fruits and faint notes of bourbon and oak.  Delicious stuff.  Lots of flowery honey, sweet fruits, maple, caramel, earthy spices and again just a hint of whiskey and wood.  Thick, creamy body has a lasting finish of dry honey wine, bourbon and oak.  Quite refreshing and easy to drink considering complexity.  Should age quite well.  Thanks Steve!","Colorado, USA","rye726"
4129,"2010-07-24",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2010 6oz nip bottle from dean. Thank u sir... Pours a mostly transparent honey pale yellow hue, forever still, lovely legs but seems a tad bit thinner than the rest for some reason or another... Huge intense bursting arom of honeycomb cinammon and pure maple syrup. Lovely and assertive. Smell this for a long time... Flavors are so in par with the aroma that is disgustingly consistent. Sweet desserty honeycomb, vaniilla, maple, cinammon. What the heck isnt in this that isnt solid? Smooth, sweet, terribly drinkable in small doses or maybe even huge quantities.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
4129,"2010-07-24",4.6,"From a bottle. To call this anything short of mindblowing would be a sin. Ive never smelled anything so rich and perfectly crafted. Perhaps it seems an easy out as both a brewer and a drinker to make and drink dessert stuff like this, but the execution here is so dead on that proper respect must be paid. Id heard this was good, but it was impossible to be prepared for the utter richness that you will find in the aroma of this mead. A full on blast of maple, macadamia nut, amaretto, and tons of marzipan and maraschino are pure delight, like burying your nose in the richest, most lovely sweet breakfast. The flavor is more subtle, refined, actually possessing solid mead notes to go along with the sweetness and marzipan. Cinnamon and sugar galore. This is a masterpiece.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
4129,"2010-07-24",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2013 Big thanks to Dean for sharing this. Pours a clear honey yellow gold with no head. Aroma is sweet with cinnamon, banana, syrup and of course some honey. Flavor is similar with sweet banana and honey in the start with cinnamon and syrup notes growing towards the finish. This is a pretty crazy mead!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
4129,"2010-07-17",4.8,"Extended cheers to Greg, Tpd975 for sharing this bottle. Just the though of this mead is phenomenal. 
thick honey coating all over the glass.
huge cinnamon nose, vanilla and barrel along with banana, floral honey blossom.
The rest is hugely enhanced by the experience of drinking this mead that is phenomenal. You could literally sit here for hours marveling at the nose of this beverage.
Palate is sticky with nice honey presence, banana along with some caramel; honey sugar.
Its sweet, boozy, loaded with barrel greatness, definitely get a lot of honey, lots of cinnamon and vanilla. Not sure what they use, either extract or not but I could spend hours sipping on a glass.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
4129,"2010-07-08",5.0,"UPDATED: APR 19, 2012 Huge thanks to Vigo and Jale for picking these up for me and bringing them to DLD.

A:  Pours a nice light honey yellow, very thick, almost syrup like.

S:  Aromas of honey laden bananas foster.  Strong almond notes with hints of cinnamon and vanilla.

T:  Wonderful and sweet.  Dessert in a bottle.  Banana and cinnamon lead the way.  Notes of almond and honey sweetness.  Vanilla is there, a bit doughy, very much true to its name.

M:  Medium, still, sweet awesome.  I love this thing.  I am a bit sad that I just popped my last bottle.","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
4129,"2010-07-03",4.2,"Wow !! What an amazing combination of flavors. Cinnamon, nutmeg, maple syrup, bananas, and just the right amount of bourbon presence. Good mouthfeel. Sweet as to be expected, but not cloying in any way. Really does taste like you had some great banana French toast with a touch of bourbon-infused maple syrup. Incredible mead !","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","bulldogp04"
4129,"2010-06-04",4.3,"Pale yellow pour with no head.  The aroma is immense vanilla, cinnamon, french toast, ripe banana and floral clover honey.  The flavor follows through from the aroma but is slightly less sweet than the aroma with pronounced clover, wildflowers and fresh banana.  The body is sticky and smooth with a solid alcohol warming on the finish.Earlier Rating: 3/27/2010 Total Score: 4.4Clear, yellow-gold color, no head, and some legs after swirling.  Intense, ripe banana aroma with hints of cinnamon, honey, pecans, toasty caramel, vanilla extract, and a hint of bourbon on the finish.  Then flavor is bourbon, fusel alcohol, and vanilla upfront with a wave of banana, toasted pecans, and cinnamon in the middle and finishing wit some clover honey and light fruit.  Sticky viscous body with an alcohol kick.","Berkley, Michigan, USA","punkrkr27"
4129,"2010-05-16",4.1,"Bottle at DLD 2k10.  Took me awhile to read my own hand-writing on this one, but I do remember drinking this and really liking it...  Pours to a pale golden body with a wisp of white head.  The aroma is super sweet vanilla and maple syrup.  The flavor is much the same but more intensely concentrated.  There is sweet maple syrup and powdered sugar.  Bready.  The palate is thick and medium bodied.  Near syrup texture.  I see why this mead is called French toast!","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
4129,"2010-04-27",4.1,"Pours a pale yellow, straw, nice with faint haze, no head. Aromas are a nice malty sweetness, honey and maple syrup, cinnamon, batter sweetness with banana and some mellow oak and bourbon. Nice, fairly intense. Initial is a nice sweeter edged mead, nice honey and syrup, the spice sticks to the back of the palate with cinnamon. Vanilla, batter, maple, butter, banana. Interesting, really fills the palate. My favorite mead from the brewery and the best that is true to its name.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
