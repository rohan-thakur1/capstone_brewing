4071,"2013-11-17",3.2,"Glass sampled from a pitcher at the brewery. Pours a hazy yellow/brownish yellow in color with very little head formation. Its pretty flat overall. The nose is lemon rind, must, barnyard, and some light apple. I can definitely tell the difference between this sample and the oude lambik on cask at Moeder. This doesnt quite have the assertive acidity that the Oude lambik does and it doesnt seemed nearly as developed. The flavors are softer, but unrefined in comparison. Light, dull mouthfeel that is a little watery and oily. Has a short to moderate finish.

4071,"2011-05-03",4.2,"My first unblended lambic. so forgive this is this is quite a naive rating. It is pretty special, not as assertive as I would have expected. Orange and unclear with a small foamy head. Fruity aroma. Quite dry with citric tartness and funk. The flavour is sharp and moderately dry, with orange tartness and apples. The soft body and no carbonation contrasts with the sharpness of the flavour and is joyous.","Antwerp, BELGIUM","onlyrocknroll"

Lacks the deep sourness and acidity of the oude version we tasted at the brewery that same morning.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"

Translucent yellow and flat, this tastes like lemons, green apples, and white wine. Its thin, lacking in funk, sourness, and lacing, but is supplemented by massive oak floorboards.

4071,"2010-07-29",4.0,"Sampled at Cantillon; July 2010
The beer arrives from the barrel with a lightly hazed, amber gold color to it that has almost a single ring of bubbles around the rim of the glass.  The aroma is sweet and cidery smelling up front and has a really interesting pineapple like note to it.  The finish even has some peach-flavored tea like aromas to it.  Aromas like straw as well as a wheat-like grain note in the finish are also found in the nose, but it is the really interesting fruit and tea character that I keep getting drawn too.  This last is so striking and contrasts greatly with the older Lambics from Cantillon.

The beer tastes lightly tart up front and finishes with a tea like flavor as well as some oak woodiness.  This is of course very flat and smooth on the tongue, though there is a touch of texture here (from the oak and lactic character); this is light an quaffable for sure though.  A touch of spicy sourness in the finish doesnt seem to be acetic, in fact I am pretty sure it is not (though this is the usual source of spicy sourness for me).  This also tastes of apricot, peach and more pineapple; it is interesting that the pineapple is so noticeable, it makes me wonder if Brettanomyces Anomolus or Clausenii was particularly strong in this batch; though I suppose the normal Lambic Brett strains can produce similar flavors.

The really incredible fruit character in the nose and mouth makes for an intriguing and tasty Lambic experience.  I really like the unique flavors that this young Lambic has.  I also like that it smells so sweet and fruity, but it is not nearly so sweet in the flavor and that the fruit still manages to carry through to the flavor quite well.  My belly is getting a bit rumbly at the moment as I have definitely been drinking my fair share of Lambic early in the day; what a happy sensation.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

How: Glass from a pitcher filled from a barrel.  Directly at the brewery

In long: Nose is moderately barnyard and apples notes.  Taste is sour young apples, a lot of wood, some candied apples.  Minimal carbonation.  Not that different from their Oude Lambik I had at Moeder Lambik a few days before.  A little more wet wood but a lot less dry.  A fun tick, but not something I would go back to with so many far superior Cantillon products widely available.  Yet another lambic.
