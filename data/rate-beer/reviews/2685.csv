2685,"2016-10-29",3.7,"Poured from a 22 oz bottle with a bottling date of 12/1/2010. 
Aroma is malt forward with lots of dark caramel and some toffee notes. Some lighter chocolate notes with some rye spice. Light bourbon notes with a bit of oak. Hints of alcohol spice. Light raisin, fig and prune notes. 
Pours black with dark brown hues and a medium sized, thick, light mocha head that recedes slowly, but steadily to the edges where it lingers on the edges. Moderately small lacing and medium small legs. 
Flavor is moderately sweet with some light rye notes, moderately strong caramel and toffee. Lighter chocolate and burnt sugar notes. Light bourbon notes with faint oak. Light roast and medium bitterness. Light alcohol spice. Light raisin, fig and prune notes. 
Mouthfeel is medium to medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low, but present alcohol notes. 
Overall, a good beer but not a great one. A bit boring as well, but for the price and availability it was worth it. More fruit as it warms. A little more bourbon and malt complexity would be nice.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
2685,"2016-06-05",3.8,"(Bottling date: 10/4/2010. Thanks Tony!) Une mousse brune épaisse flotte sur un liquide qui a lapparence dun gros stout. Le nez annonce rapidement ses couleurs sucrées. Le caramel, la mélasse, la figue, le raisin sec, la datte et la vanille sont heureusement secoués par des notes de whisky piquant. Les saveurs sont harmonieuses: le mélange doux et amer est agréable. En bouche, le corps épais montre des bulles salvatrices. La finale est rendue relativement sèche par lalcool.

2685,"2014-08-18",4.1,"Aged 4yrs. Pours a reddish dark brown with a defined espresso colored head that laces my glass as it dissipates. The aroma is very complex. I noticed a semi sweet rye whiskey scent and the rye has a pleasant spiciness. In the aroma I also picked up on mild to medium levels of carmel roasted malts. As for tasting I noticed a complexity of sweetness with a subtle roasted bitter quality that blended rather well with the alcohol content. The finish was very kind considering the abv, the tamed bitterness, weak spice, and a diverse flavor of sweet malted grains. I enjoyed a soft dryness in the finish too. Overall I was surprised how well this aged and the carbonation was spot on to what I desire in a brew. I would definitely like to enjoy this one again.","Steubenville, Ohio, USA","Advocate_Ames"

2685,"2013-10-30",2.9,"In short: A sweet, boozy and woody dark ale. Aggressive without class. Just ok.
How: Bottle 12oz, consumed when many months of age.
The look: Near black body with ruby highlights topped by a small beige head.
In long: Nose has some nail polish, sensation of watered down various hard liquors (brandy, cognac, etc.), toasted wood. Taste is a whole mix bag of stuff. I noted toasted rye bread, coconut, a shot of whiskey, a lot of toasted brown sugars, a shot of brandy, dried crunchy caramel, vanilla, dark liquorice, more I could go on. Not really a complex beer, just lots of flavor elements put together. Alcohol is quite apparent, feels even higher than its 10.5%. This is an very sweet beer, even for a 10% brew. Not sure how to explain this but I this blend version tasted sweeter than some of its higher abv components (I had its individual components before). This is a sweet boozy beer but without the richness and corpulence I expect from a such a beer. Drinkable but not really enjoyable. Im not gonna close this rating with my usual sarcastic bad taste bad taste comment, no jew stereotype joke this time, because Im certain if the brewer of this jewish-themed brewery had a dollar for each bad jew stereotype joke he heard he would take all that money and put it in a high interest savings account.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Finishes extremely smooth with the sweetness carrying through to the end with just a hint of booze. Delightful.

2685,"2013-03-13",4.2,"22oz bottled December 1, 2010.  Over 2 years old.  Served at cellar temperature.  Purchased from the beer cellar at Beverage World.

Pours very dark brown to black with a two finger brown head that settles to a small creamy cap and leaves a bit of lacing behind.

On the aroma, the whiskey hits you first and foremost, really nice, then its just layers of malt complexity, chocolate, molasses, vanilla, oak, coffee, toffee, overripe dark fruits of dates, figs, plums and raisins, some sinus-clearing alcohol.  Excellent strength.

Flavor is amazing.  Whiskey, vanilla and oak, dates, figs, plums, chocolate, coffee, molasses, fairly sweet, moderate bitterness, still some alcohol heat on the finish.  Very complex and rich.

A - Pours a dark, dark red/brown body. Appears black until held up to the light. Massive head forms, then settles into a fingers worth of light khaki foam. Super sticky lacing with long lasting retention. 

S - Holy mother of rye! Rye spice, sweet caramel, figs, maple, raisins, vanilla, oak, chocolate, pears...man this is a great smell. Very sweet with that distinct rye bite to balance things out. The interesting thing is that it really balances on the line between stout and barleywine without adhering to a real style. 

T - Rye spice, oak, vanilla, chocolate, raisins, and butterscotch. Not as impressive as the nose but its still awfully intriguing and unique. Very barleywine-esque with plenty of chocolate and barrel notes to shake things up a bit. 

M - Medium bodied and creamy with low to moderate carbonation.

O - This is drinking very damn well right now! Very unique blend of beers with a fantastic rye whiskey edge on it. I was very impressed by this beer.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Screw the 100% barrel aging - blending is the best way to go. This is a perfect example of it. And guess what? I did not have to stand in line at a release or trade my first born for it.

Heavy choc and black patent malts, cacao, honey, blackstrap molasses, huge hops, oaky cognac, and maple syrupy wafts.  Tastes rich, very malty, with cacao, charred chocolate malt, nuts, and a lot of backup hops.  The palate is medium in heft, very complex, and the alcohol is present late.  Smooth, and the complexity stays around even as it warms, and the hops emerge more late.  This is a very good beer.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

2685,"2011-10-21",4.4,"Smells awesome - reminds me of Pelican MOAS if my frozen memory serves me correctly. I will love this beer. Poured out a deep brown brew with red highlights and a small, compact light brown head and leaves sticky, ropy lacing. The aroma is awesome. Tons of whiskey, wood, roasted nuts, chocolate... then everything else is thirdondary. Red berries, more roast. Smells better when NOT going too deep. Deep roasted nuttiness and sweetness - just an awesome smelling beer. The flavour doesnt disappoint either. Thick and creamy mouthfeel every time and the coating just seems to build and build - smooth like wax - I love eating wax - especially on my fruit. Just the right amount of sweetness keeps everything in check. Whiskey hits early and can be found at any point in every sip but never dominates - this is very well put together. Wood, roast, caramel,... it just occurred to me that I dont thinkI ever smelt that chocolate because I certainly cannot taste it. Raisin, candy, slight spice that may just be an alcohol burn. Deep caramel, a bit of melted brown sugar, probably a touch of hops somewhere. Nothing I dont like about this. I need a tub full of this shit.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

2685,"2011-09-22",3.5,"22oz., Batch No. 2, bottled on 12/1/10.  This is just a crazy concept here, I had to try it.  Heavy aroma of dark malts, copious amounts of malt in fact, with plenty of roasted sweetness, alongside notes of toffee, black bread, cola, dark fruits, bubblegum, chocolate, rye whiskey and a tinge of medicinal alcohol.  Formidable opaque brown-black color with a lasting, fine, light tan head.  Flavor is absolutely the strong, sweet, barrel-aged, malt hullabaloo it was promised to be, with so many malty aspects from start to finish: nuttiness, varying degrees of roast and toast, dark bread, soy, chocolate, burnt caramel, raisin, dark fruity sweetness, as well as a pervasive bitterness throughout, a certain vinous touch and aspects of rye whiskey barrel, primarily at the finish, which is massive, lingering and warming.  Hefty, almost syrupy mouthfeel, low in effervescence and just huge on the palate, body is beyond full.  This was a fair match for my rough expectation of it, certainly an interesting experiment overall.  Who else would do this?","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

2685,"2011-09-17",4.5,"Bottle from Pacific Liquor: Poured with a delicate topping of head that eventually broke down into patches of foam where as the liquid was a solid dark brown that was completely opaque.  I recently had HeBrews 14th anniversary ale so the smell of rich and robust roasted malts is still fresh in my mind, but with this beer, there is all the dark roasted malts as well as scent of wood and whiskey barrel. The flavor is rich with sweet caramelized malts that hint towards maple syrup while also having a deep base of roasted malts. Not to mention that there is also a heavy presence of whiskey barrel as the wood and alcohol brings dryness and heat to the finish. Amazing vertical combination of the last 7 years and I feel lucky enough to have been able to taste each years anniversary ale since the 8th and also find a bottle of this too.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

2685,"2011-04-20",3.5,"Bottle courtesy of bmanning. Served in a tulip.

Pours near black with a thin tan head a bubbly collar. The nose is a bit plain with only a bit of slight barrel character and roast. The taste brings more barrel notes as well as some of the rye whiskey and a slight amount of roasted malt. There is some chocolate character there as well. The mouthfeel is really quite smooth ad integrates the whiskey quite well. Medium to full body. Drinkability is nice and certainly enhanced by the smooth feel.

Big barrely nose with some dark fruits and earthy malts on the nose...interesting result. Maybe too much in the way of liquor barrel fumes, but the rye doesnt overpower other than that hot bite. Creamy medium body, surprisingly light. Earthy rye, caramel, figs, and an overall sense of candied fruit on the mid-palate. A little bitey on the finish. Really a nice effort...not necessarily in terms of subtley or complexity, but in overall terms of how fun it is to drink. Hits the spot.

2685,"2011-03-24",2.6,"Batch 002 / 892 cases. Bottled 12/1/2010. Poured into a snifter.

4.0 A: Black color or at least pretty damn close to black. Two and a half fingers of creamy/frothy light brown head. The first two fingers falls rather quickly, but the last half sticks around a good while. Some nonuniform lacing.

3.5 S: The nose is mellow, too mellow for its own damn good. The rye whiskey is the most apparent aroma and is the only component with any power. Chocolate and caramel lead the malts with vanilla and peachy fruitiness from the barrel. Not bad by any means, but the underlying cuvee desparately needs a boost in strength.

3.0 T: The taste is pretty mediocre. The flavors dont mesh well together. The whiskey dominates with the rye giving a earthy spiciness. A lot of vanilla, melon, and oak flavor as well with a touch of astringency. Unfortunately, the base beers cant quite blend well with the whiskey and barrel flavors. Chocolate, caramel, and toffee are there in plentiful proportions. Prune, fig, molasses, and brown sugar. Not enough roastiness to balance everything out.

3.5 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. A bit chewier than I like, but otherwise smooth. Some booze on finish.

2.5 D: This has the problem of the barrel dominating the beer and the beer itself being too sweet. I would have liked this better if it were dried out a bit and only half of it barrel aged.

2685,"2011-01-26",3.0,"On tap at Bodega. 

A- Served headless in a 10oz flower vase. The beer is a perhaps a little lighter than I thought it was going to be. It certainly aligns itself with the brown hues. A little bit of raw honey coloration in the highlights. 

S- The aroma is very sweet, but Im not surprised. Each Jewbelation has some sort of fruit that has biblical significance, plus this is whiskey barreled. It is certainly figgy with a velvety vanilla underpinning. The whiskey adds some more mellow smoothness. The maltiness of the base blend is of the caramel order with toffee and nougat. 

T- This is a big beer, and lets you know it, but also doesnt beat your taste buds down. Its a big beer that lets you still feel tough. Whiskey and oak weave a basket of vanilla and spicy alcohol in which a caramel and dark fruit base is carried. The finish is sweet with fruits along the lines of wine grapes, figs, dates, plums, you know, King David food.

2685,"2010-12-29",4.1,"Thanks to jjfoodie and yelof77 for sharing this bottle. I am a big fan of the other Jewbelation beers so I have high hopes for this one.

The beer pours a dark brownish-red color with a tan head. The aroma is heavy on the rye whiskey, but I also get a lot of cherries, maple, oak and vanilla. A very inviting aroma. 

The flavor is heavy on the brown sugar, rye whiskey, maple and roasted malt. The alcohol, as it is in most Jewbelation beers, is present. That being said, it goes very well with the other flavors and doesnt hurt the drinkability in any way. 

Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. Very drinkable for a beer that is 10.5 percent alcohol. A great beer that didnt disappoint.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"

2685,"2010-12-26",4.2,"Batch 2. Pours black, with a dense tan head, and that old familiar red tinge when held to light. Pretty. Holy moly this smells delicious - the rye really added an earthy quality that it was missing before - Jewbelation is normally a very, very sweet brew... and this version is reeled in with a better balance and greater complexity. Raisins and figs blend with dark chocolate, toasted malts, some candi sugar, oak, and a bunch of vanilla. This puppy doesnt disappoint. All of those notes come through in the flavor, and its just effervescent enough to keep it from being sticky in your mouth. The rye is there, but not at all overpowering, and this seems the perfect blend of all of these brews. Im really, really impressed - absolutely worth the money. Heres hoping they make a habit of this blend, now that the series is approaching impossible recipes (15%, 15 kinds of hops and malts). Fantastic.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

Appearance: Pours an essentially black body with an initial tall, airy, beige head which eventually settles into a thinnish layering.

Smell: Earthy, barrel-licked, lightly sweetish nose with well-integrated notes smelling dark caramel, humble chocolate, moistened previously dried fruits, and carefully charred oak barrels.

Taste: Smooth, sweet caramel and sugary milk chocolate with additional sweet additions of brown sugar sliding effortlessly into coconut-vanilla cake and piquant oak with a carefully dosed dash of whiskey. Hints of coffee and oven-burnt pumpernickel bread crusts. Slight wooden and earthen tones. Not much bitterness felt, really, or heated booze for that matter. Rye spiciness from the malts utilized as well as the Sazerac barrel as well as the hops used. Sweetish, oak-aged finish with a pleasing smoothness to it.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation. Features that pleasant smoothness found throughout the majority of the HeBrew anniversary beers.

Drinkability: After the particularly potent Jewbelation 14, Im surprised (and pleased) by the relative smoothness of this brew. Very enjoyable, and, now that I hear its available in bombers, besides the task of just hunting down another gift box, I may grab another bottle to quietly age.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
2685,"2010-12-23",3.6,"Sampled on tap at 1702, Tucson; December 2010
The beer arrives from the tap, in its special Jewbelation Vertical glass, with an opaque, concentrated amber color that is topped by a frothy, ½-finger thick, dark amber tinged tanned head.  The beer shows a touch of clear, deep red / brown hue when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of vanilla soaked toasted coconut, softly spicy oak, Bourbon, some toasted malt character that has a richly concentrated caramel character to it.  The aroma is appetizing and well integrated, though not entirely unsurprising.

Soft and creamy feeling, the flavor accentuates this as does the light carbonation.  Nice flavors of vanilla and coconut infuse the tongue and palate along with sweet, concentrated, caramelized malt character that plays more of supporting role than being intrinsically being noticeable in and of itself.  The beer finishes with some spicy and hot alcohol notes that are subdued enough to not get annoying as well as a sort of tartness that I associated with charred oak and Bourbon.  There is perhaps a touch of almost roasted malt character to this beer that helps to dry out the overall effect of this beer.  This has a fullness to it, enough to coat the palate and provide a creamy texture, that balances the barrel character quite well; this is definitely a sipping beer, though it is not cloying as it has enough barrel influenced spiciness, toasty malt character and alcoholic warming to keep this fairly well balanced.  At times this seems to remind me a bit of some sort of richly caramelized mix of soda and ice-cream; it is more the feeling of this than any particular flavors, perhaps it is the texture that has evoked these.

This is a pretty nice barrel aged brew, while the Whiskey / barrel character is dominant, it is smooth enough to not become overwhelming and the rich, chewy malt character certainly helps with this as well.  And I always like when a barrel aged brew is able to achieve the vanilla and toasted coconut character that this beer manages to achieve.  This ends up being a very nice cap to my long, working lunch.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Very strong raspberry, tartaric, winy aroma, with some more subtle, interesting bits like smoke, violet, and cider. Flavor is quite sweet and roasty with generous round caramelly bourbon, but there is also a non-negligible swampy component that reminds me of spit on a hot lightbulb, and none of that appealing tartness in the nose gets carried through in the flavor.

2685,"2010-11-25",3.7,"Draft at Redlight Redlight, consumed right after having the vertical 8-14 flight.  The body is a clear, dark, reddish-mahogany color, and it supports a small head of mocha foam.  Small rings of lacing mark the glass.  Rye whiskey immediately infiltrates the nose, bringing notes of caramelized sugars, lightly charred, oaky vanilla, and a hint of peanut skins.  Underlying that is singed caramel and stewed dark fruit, primarily fig.  Flavors offer a surprising dose of dry roast, suggesting some chocolate and a touch of coffee, though sweeter caramel and residual fruity sugars rush in to re-claim dominance.  Figs and raisins, a common theme in this series, are prominent.  The rye serves as a nice, warming accompaniment, rich with oak and hinting at carraway.  The palate, as logic would dictate, falls somewhere between the 11 and the 12 in terms of sugary heft, thinned a bit perhaps by the rye barrel.  Consistently moderate in carbonation, the body goes down easy and finishes warm and woody.  Good brew.  I like this blend quite a bit.  Nice to try the entire vertical in one sitting.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
2685,"2010-11-25",3.2,"12oz. bottle from the Vertical Jewbelation Hanukkah pack.  Pours out black as sin under a fluffy tan head, only some lacing.  Aroma is temptingly sweet, with hints of molasses, wood, rum soaked raisins, and lots of chocolate.  Definitely smells like a sippin beer, some boozy notes.  Taste hits exactly like a barrel aged stout would.  Hard to beleive this is a ""American Strong Ale"".  Everything about the look/smell/taste screams Imperial Stout.  Anyhow, the flavor hits with lots of wood barrel rum (or whiskey), chocolate, molasses, black licorice, a hint of plum, ends in more wood and booze.  Somewhat messy flavor profile and texture.  If you love boozy wood-aged beers, this is fine and well.  But this one doesnt do it for me, exactly.  Too heavy and boozy.  Its trying too hard.  Not terrible though.

Aromas of dry rye whiskey, tons of dark fruit, tobacco, oak, vanilla, dusty and spicy. Caramel and molasses. (Side thought...this thing has 77 ""different"" malts in it, not including the malt in the rye whiskey...hmm...).  (on another note, shouldnt this be at least 11%, if not more? If it is a straight blend of the beers it should be 11% before any barrel aging. Apparently there is a heavy reliance on 8 and 9 in this blend). There is some familiar smell (not altogether pleasant) that I am picking up. I cannot place it though. Popcorn maybe? Flavors of rye whiskey, oak, and dark fruit. Beyond that I cannot pick out much else. A sheer melee of flavors. Some cotton candy and cola notes. Creamy carbonation. Big mouthfeel, lingering tannins. An interesting concept, but the actual beer ends up a bit muddled. The reason why I rate it highly is that there is nothing technically wrong with the flavors, and I am a sucker for barrel aged beers.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
