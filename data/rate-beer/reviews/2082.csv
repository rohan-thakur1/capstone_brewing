2082,"2015-03-21",3.8,"Bottled, from Systembolaget.  Cloudy golden, small head. Fruity nose with some hay and ripe fruit. Dryish with medium body and rounded mouthfeel. Leafy autumn apples, some hay and vanilla. Low bitterness. A bit too clean malt, otherwise well balanced and pleasant north French country style ale.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"

2082,"2014-07-17",3.7,"On tap at Bigbys Pour House in Addison, IL., and dispensed to a tulip with a lightly hazed, orangey gold color, a fluffy, white layer of head foam, and sheet-like lacing that turned to clingy spray on the glass. The nose started with banana, then biscuit, spice, and esters as peach & pear. Medium bodied, the taste offered a low bitterness with some lingering grain, and  barrel astringency, fruit, a touch of tartness, and some dryness to the finish. Decently carbonated and crisp.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
2082,"2014-03-22",3.0,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2014 Frisk o go i doften. Flaska. Kraftig kolsyrad. Kolatoner i smaken med behaglig beska. Något söt. Tyvärr så blir det alltför vinlik för att  drickas igen.","SWEDEN","dojken"
2082,"2013-08-14",3.2,"Bottle from TW Camelback (Phoenix) from like 2 years ago - I forgot to record this one when I had it last week, but I was a solid farmhouse ale. I didnt get a lot of the complexity they described, but thats probably due to the aging. Solid, though.","Virginia, USA","magsinva"

2082,"2012-02-04",3.9,"On tap at Maxs during todays Stillwater event. Served in a cervoise.

Pours a slightly-hazy peach color with a good white head and a bit of lacing on the way down. The nose brings some light oak and a bit of wine and accompanying tannin. A bit of stone fruit character there as well. The flavor brings forward stone fruit and light citrus. A bit of wine and oak. All really well integrated. Very mellow with low carbonation and a smooth, semi-dry finish. Really nice done; this beer was greatly enhanced by the barrel.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
2082,"2012-01-29",2.9,"draft... red wine ba version... disappointing as I didnt get any of the barrel, a standard boring saison that Ill pass on in the future","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"
2082,"2012-01-28",3.8,"Draught at Churchkey. Super opaque, roseate amber pour with a small head. Nose is full of sweet toffee, vinous plum and fig, and nice herbal and floral notes from the heather and honeysuckle. Flavor proves that this is definitely the lightest in barrel prevalence of the Stillwater barrel aged series so far (that I""ve had). Still a touch of woody funk. Nice, but the least intriguing of the barrel aged Stillwater beers.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
2082,"2011-12-22",3.7,"On tap at Maxs, Baltimore. Very cloudy orange pour, with only modest carbonation. The nose recalls the abundantly floral scent of the base beer, with a strongly vinous, pungent addition that seems to accentuate rather than temper the rye and spice. Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit thick, with some slight spice on the palate. Flavors are super earthy and herbal, and the musty wood from the barrel tends to emphasize this just a bit more, making this slightly better than the base to me.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
2082,"2011-10-12",3.4,"Draft.  Medium-white head, cloudy amber body.  Aroma is medium sweet, vinous, some wood, earthy, grape.  Taste is medium sweet, grape, wood/earthy.  Light-medium body.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2082,"2011-10-11",3.3,"Tap at Maxs of Fells Point. The pour is a hazy, glowing orange. No head. Nose is candied orange, flowers, husky malt, oatmeal. Taste is tannic, herbal, dry, sweet grain, oatmeal, bit raw oatmeal/raw malt husk character. Very earthy.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
2082,"2011-10-10",3.7,"Tap.  Pours hazy orange with a medium, frothy white head, medium retention with good lacing.  Aroma is Belgian yeast, fruity esters, light biscuit malt, light earthy hops, black pepper and oak.  Flavor is Belgian farmhouse yeast, oak, vinous, fruity esters, and medium hops and bitterness with a dry finish.  Medium body, warmth, and carbonation.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
2082,"2011-10-09",3.5,"murky gold/tangerine, moderate, lasting white ring. Nose is more cheesy Chardonnay, light celery and dust. Flavor is less green, very nice citrus, pineapple, bit of cotton candy. Thin finish, low carbonation, light hop sting.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
2082,"2011-10-09",3.5,"IPoured a very orange color with not much head.  Slightly sour aroma with veggies.  Taste has some light fruit and hops.  Pepper and flowers too.  Slightly dry, with a slightly sweet finish.","Maryland, USA","scottw86"
