3438,"2017-03-25",4.2,"2016 bottle. 
Nose is almost shockingly vegetal. Spices and coffee take a back seat. 
Body, look and flavor are more like expected, though I prefer just apple brandy to the double. Cinnamon and peppers and coffee more evident, decent amounts of chocolate and barrel. Boody is smooth even with the back end heat, and it pours like motor oil with deep cocoa head. If it werent for the nose, this would be a favorite.

Oil black pour. Signature CCB head of dark brown and dark chocolate color. Menacing color. Does fade to a thin collar quickly.

3438,"2015-05-25",4.8,"#5000. BIG thanks to digita7693 who generously shared this @ Leuven Innovation Beer Festival. The perfect beer for 5000  one of my biggest wants for 5000 actually  I never thought that I was going to actually try this one. Many thanks for all the great company & beers during the course of all the previous ratings, festivals, tastings etc. Back when I started out trying beers many years ago, I thought that didnt like beer because all that I knew was pale lager & the occasional Duvel. Tired of always drinking pale lager I decided to try some other beers & for a long time I tried one or two new ones per week at a bar near the university. They had about 40 beers I thought that there must be only about 100  200 beers in the world and that outside of Belgium they were all pale lagers. I decided to try nearly all of the beers in the world, as time went on I realized just how wrong I was Back when I realized just how many beers there were in the world, I thought that trying more like 5000 would be impossible for me over a lifetime, Turns out I was very wrong. Anyway as for the beer itself. Deep dark black, looks very viscous, some mocha bubbles but they are quickly gone. Nose is huge thick, spirit-like, huge rum & brandy I suppose, very spirit-like so maybe brandy dominates a big, thick chocolate sludge, warming, chocolate syrup, deep black chocolate, huge oak & spirit presence, almost hot, Taste is surprisingly cinnamon forward, by far the most of the Hunahpus I have tried so far, rich spirit, chocolate syrupy, warming high quality alcohol, black chocolate, very viscous, light espresso, very thick brownie dough, hugely thick & viscous, creamy, warming, thick exotic sugar, Insanely thick & high quality spirit lingers on afterwards. Impressive, Stranahan still probably remains my favourity. Very happy to have tried one of my biggest wants.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
3438,"2015-05-24",4.9,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2015 Courtesy of Martinus at Leuven Innovation Beer Festival, big thanks for this one. Almost no head, some loose beige bubbles which quickly disappear (probably because this precious bottle has been opened and resealed over and over again), colour a very dark burgundy, near black. Absolutely wonderful aroma of infinite complexity: a strong perfume of noble chocolate, vanilla, coconut, cinnamon, hint of dried soft chili pepper, espresso, soy sauce, bayleaf, candied dates, old port and old sherry, marzipan, banana liqueur... Truly incredible. Taste is equally amazing, a symphony of candied fruits, slight salty soy sauce accents, sweet marzipan and Bounty candy coconut plus chocolate, caramel and tons of chocolate fondant, all playing in a thick, heavy, profound texture; finish has more bitter chocolate and fine coffee in store, enriched with a vinous, warming alcohol effect of the finest brandy or single malt you can find, still a very faint hint of chili and peppery hops drying a bit and leaving you flabbergastered as if you just swallowed the most precious liquid ever made. This belongs to the most complex, most rewarding and most satisfying things I ever tasted. I owe great thanks to Martinus for being kind enough to share this whale, I feel privileged.

3438,"2015-04-08",4.9,"Many thanks to Kevin for the bottle.

Pours a pitch black, motor oil color, revealing a slick viscosity after swirling, with a hazelnut brown, small head, which soon disappears.
Leaves back alcoholic spider legs, mingling into the darkness of the beer.


Smells of spiced, hot, chocolate, together with a wooden, slightly fruity burn. The scorched malts blend very smoothly into the hot qualities of the beer, both chilies and alcohol. Provides a rich bakers chocolate layer, enriching the unique spiciness, by ending up being a ebenbürtiger, smooth counterpart to them. Brandy exhibits a certain apple fruitiness, which gets picked up by faint lemony tequila, gently wrapped up by cinnamon and chocolate. 

Has an outstandingly smooth mouthfeel, with a lower carbonation, giving the beer enough room to unfold its full, complex body.

Tastes of alcoholic truffels, with a fruity whiff, coated up by cinnamon and chilies. All flavors are very pronounced and well integrated into the overall taste, mainly defined by a decadent mexican chocolate foundation. The beer got a spicy chili bite to it, inviting an alcoholic, wooden flavor to the palate, while both flavors blend flawlessly into each other, providing a unique depth, backed up by ashy chocolate and cinnamon. No booziness hovers above the different, diverse flavors, due to chocolate malts, which are incredible well pronounced, building upa prominent backbone. Finishes with matured, slightly bitter hops, with all other flavors still being recognizable, especially the wooden, part floral, part fruity spirits, which provide a harsh, but pleasant dryness.

This beer is fantastic, its well balanced depth of flavor is far superior to the base beer, with both barrels enriching the flavor. Results in a never before experienced complexity in a spiced imperial stout, with cinnamon being even more present than in the regular version, accentuating the malty chocolate qualities of the beer perfectly. The double burn, due to chilies and spirits, acts as a long lasting, pleasant and well integrated peak, slowly evolving from the luscious chocolate.","GERMANY","aleigator"

The nose is rich chocolate cake, powerful cinnamon, moving to graham cracker crust, and clear vanilla presence as well. There is feint vegetal quality here, with some earthen barrel notes as well. The nose is not the highlight here at all - but I knew what was to come - The flavor profile reveals a robust and fairly complex hunahpu variant - its sticky sweet, with chocolate cake and vanilla bean initial - caramel and cacao moving forward. The rum / apple brandy barrel treatment is a nice combo - although I wouldnt have been able to pick out the apple brandy without knowing it ahead of time.

The flavor is rich milk and dark chocolate up front, a bit less cinnamon than on the nose, but just enough, moving to more molasses rum, vanilla, brown sugar, and a nice hint of spicy chili pepper that has a nice burn from my throat to my belly.

The beer pours basically black with a smallish head. There is some sheeting on the glass, for sure. 

The aroma is huge, roasty & oaky with lots of vanilla and chocolate. Its very sweet smelling with a mild spiciness and some light alcohol. 
Terribly inviting.

The flavor is awfully complex, unknowing that there was any apple brandy barrels involved in the production of this beer I certainly noticed some calvados character to it. Its remarkably chocolaty and defiantly very sweet (but not without balance) Its got vanilla, and cinnamon, and a nice warming booziness. The beer is jus over the top in all aspects, and perhaps its a touch too sweet and a touch too boozy, but these are easily forgiven given the depth of flavor and the utter richness of the beer.

I hesitate to give this one a 5 on palate, although the sheer thickness and mouth coating syrupy nature of it generally lent my opinion towards that inclination. Over the top is over the top though, and that one luxurious as it is may be pushing excess in the mouthfeel department.

3438,"2014-08-31",4.3,"Bottle, thanks to David! Pours a deep black with dark brown ring. This has to be the most aromatic beer as far as spices go, the aroma is insanely intense. It feels like a dessert buffet: gingerbread, chocolate cake, vanilla, cinnamon bun, apple turnover. Moderate (well balanced) habanero notes to up these dessert spices even more (aroma and taste). Taste is very sweet (a little cloying) and the apple brandy barrels has a very nice presence. Palate is rather light for such a big beer.

The barrel character seems lost, I wish it wasted more boozy because this is one decadent beer. Its a touch to sweet to crush a bunch, so with the alcohol cutting it, I could finish the whole bottle.

3438,"2014-08-12",4.8,"**Warning** -- This beer may cause a side effect of Tourette Syndrome...because I found myself blurting uncontrollable profanities as I drank this! ""Holy sh*t!"" ""Son of a b@$&h!"" and ""Motherf^*%$!"" spewed from my inner dialogue, out of my mouth and into the ears of those at the tasting. The appearance was of a very dark, thin tan-headed monster that had legs creeping up the glass for days. The nose was loaded with an arsenal of spice (cinnamon and pepper), loads of chocolate, dash of vanilla along with an ever so delicate brandy sweetness. A head-snap jerking motion triggered yet a few more profanities. ""No f*&^%@$g way!"". The first sip was even better than I could have imagined. Such balance between this cornucopia of ingredients. Loads and loads of dry chocolate coats the palate, allowing the cinnamon, tobacco and vanilla to leave their impressions. Soon, I found that I was not alone in experiencing this side effect. Our whole group began to curse in unison....as an outsider looking in, I am sure it was a horrendous site. Apologies to any witnesses that may have been harmed or offended by these outbursts! The finish brought forth more of the Brandy Barrel than the Rum, according to my palate.....with just enough heat from the peppers to cut the very present sweetness that lingers throughout. All in all, a very outstanding beer that pushes the boundaries of flavor and delicacy. Was there any booze in this? ...because I sure didnt taste any.","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"

3438,"2014-05-04",4.5,"> A total overhaul of Hunahpu creates Perennial BA Abraxas
[ Bottle ][ vacax ][ 750ml ][ 10K+OT Tasting ][ Stemless Wine Taster ][ 5/3/14 ]
>> Thanks Jake for this one! Pours ink like other Hunahpus with layer of weak, read foam. Stains the glass. Nose on this one is instantly the best of any Hunahpu variant: guajillo pepper, cinnamon, ancho chili, vanilla, graham cracker, rum raisin, dry rubbed skirt steak. Taste is also instantly the best of any Hunahpu by a long shot, in fact, this beer is so much better than previous Hunahpus that it is clear this is a complete recipe overhaul to transform this beer from an ashy, sour, thin mess to something 99% identical to Perennial Abraxas. Gone is that extreme sourness from over mashed black patent malt. Now there is rich, melted sea salted dark chocolate, assertive chili pepper deep heat from ancho chilis. Previous Hunahpus had near a smidgen of chili heat. Palate is rich and viscous instead of ashy and watery. This is a major overhaul and easily the best Hunahpu out there. Now the question is, why is this rated so much higher than BA Abraxas? Ill give you one guess.

Regular Hunahpu is one of the best beer with chili peppers, but this one is just so freaking good. You wont easily find a beer that is as complex as this one. The balance is great for this kind of beer. I really enjoyed this one!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3438,"2014-04-21",4.5,"Bottle at our Brussels beer weekend. Dark black pour with brown head. Aroma is quite perfumy, really intense raisins, cocoa, spice, cinnamon, chili peppers, rhum, like the regular but everything seems a bit more rounded. Taste is even better, lots of raisins, cocoa, nice alcohol and chili warmth without being vegetal or actually hot. Palate is full bodied, palate coating but with nice carbonation. My favorite hunahpu all night, beautiful.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
3438,"2014-04-19",4.7,"Bottle. The pour is dark and think, it coats the glass heavily. The aroma is a great mix of sweet apple and booze, very inviting. The taste is amazingly good.

Awesome!","The Hague / Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","kermis"
3438,"2014-04-19",4.6,"Okay then.. Puors black with the nicest head you can emagine. Perfect size and density. The smell is to die for. Hard to understand how they can pack so much chocolate, licorice, barrel (not too much though) chili, vanilla and slight booze into a beer. There is some pretty noticable coffee and coconut in here too. Its really rich this one. The mouthfeel is thick but manageable. The flavour is insane too. Its like regular Hunahs beefed up big brother with some complex barrel character on the side. Please give this time to settle in the glass, open up and reveal itself, cause if you treat Hunah just right, it could give you a craftbeer boner! Fo realz. Its dat gewd!","DENMARK","Hoprider"
3438,"2014-04-15",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2015 Bottle: Huge thanks to Travis & Tommy for splitting this with me. Black, black, black & oily as fuck, topped with a velvety, fine mocha cream that lasts exceedingly long for a stout. This beer is a bowl Cinnamon Toast Crunch & Teddy Grahams covered in vanilla drizzle, fudge, & sweet Apple Brandy sauce. Chocolate, roast, sweet brandy, vanilla, cinnamon, mild coffee, graham cracker.... Only thing I dont get is the chili peppers, Im guessing the barrels have swallowed them whole. I dont mind, though, because they might interfere with the decadence of this brew. Thick, chewy, creamy; this is a very big beer on the palate. A dessert beer to the max, fantastic all around.
Update: After having this quite a few more times thanks to many generous BAs, as well as some local tasting groups, I have to bump the score up. This just gets better & better. Molten  Chips Ahoy & Teddy Graham cookies with cinnamon graham cracker, apple brandy, vanilla bean chips & dark fudge drizzle. This is truly an excellent beer.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Full-bodied and chewy with lazy carbonation. The flavor is a swirl of sweet caramel, fudge, chocolate creme, spiced rum, molasses and cinnamon accompanied by mild chili heat. Tobacco and burnt marshmallow in the finish with lingering chili and liquor warmth. Liquid intensity - but silky-smooth as well.

Pours a dark black color with a thick chocolate head that breaks down quickly. The head retention is amazing for a barrel aged brew. Aroma of chocolate roast, dark fruit, apple, pepper, vanilla, and hints of breadiness. Really intoxicating. A sweet chocolate taste with notes of chili, vanilla, and slight cinnamon. A nice layer of heat from the pepper. Wow. It really is hard to say whether this or the base version is better. So much complexity. So much happening during the first 3 seconds on the tongue. Just another amazing brew that I likely will never be fortunate to drink again. Kudos to Redner and a big thanks to Damico.","North Caldwell, New Jersey, USA","Chalsk"

Firmer spirit, tannic, and warmth. Initial is firmer bodied, a bit thick with some decent warmth. Touches of of rum, vanilla and brown sugar, touches of toasted coconut. Touches of mint, spirit, and fudge. Sweeter caramel, some thickness. Backend is a bit warm, gentle chile and warmth with vanilla, roasty coffee. Keeps a good body even with the firm barrel. A bit warm, roasty, caramel, with gentle coconut, pepper and spirit. Quality stuff, perhaps a bit overbarreled on the nose but the beer itself is pretty on point.

A - Pours jet black with a small film of tan head, quickly dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving no lace at all on the glass. Pretty much dead flat almost instantly.


S - Smells of milk chocolate, chili spices, vanilla beans, cinnamon, spicy rum and fruity brandy warmth. Everything that should be present is there and shining brightly.


T - Starts off with a mix of cinnamon and chili spices quickly being joined by the milk chocolate, vanilla and toffee sweetness. The spicy rum and fruity brandy match perfectly with the base flavors. Finish is spicy sweet with some mild booze burn, lingering long after the finish.


M - Heavy body with moderate to low carbonation. Slick, spicy feel with a bit of heat at the end of each sip. Just needs more carbonation and it would be amazing.


O - This is a pretty incredible beer. The two barrels blend very well together and complement the base flavors amazingly well. I would still take the Apple Brandy version over this one but it is closer than any of the other variants I have had to date.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

3438,"2014-03-05",4.1,"Thanks DmouthCaliBrewz for sharing this bottle with me. Split 4 ways (more than enough I should add) at about 55 Degrees F in snifters.

A - Pitch black, 1 finger head that fades fast. Great legs, some minor particles on the swish. Looks eerily similar to straight up regular Hunahphu. 

S - Nose WHOA. this is a different beast than its little brother. Maple, cupcake, vanilla, rocky road ice cream, the brandy sweetness definitely comes in like its 4th of July.

T - Again, shines even deeper. I would guess this is way higher than 14% ABV. Wedding Cake, brownie batter, pepper only at middle to end and doesnt linger. the spice is in no way hanging on for dear life. You get this bright maple waffles and chocolate cupcake like this is all dessert and should pair really well with NOTHING. drink it straight up after eating a steak dinner. youve deserved it!

3438,"2014-02-27",4.9,"Bottle all to myself because I am a selfish bastard. This one pours pitch black, thick and inky looking, with nothing but a little rim of dark brown bubbles on top until I get a bit more aggressive, then I get a nice small dark brown head on top. Beautiful. Big time sweet cocoa aroma with apple brandy and some rum in the background, a bit of cinnamon, some light chile powder, booze, and some faint vanilla (I dont get much vanilla in the regular version anyway). Flavor is wow. Big time fudge hits you at the start, with a kick of cinnamon, vanilla, very faint chile burn on the way down. And thats just the start. There is a nutty flavor from the apple brandy that accents the cocoa and cinnamon perfectly. The rum is subdued, which I am glad about, but adds a subtle extra sweetness and spice, similar to what I got from Forgotten Island. The melody of flavors in this come together almost as well as Founders CBS. This has a thick viscous body as expected from CCB, with low carbonation (but more than Cali Brandy). It goes down incredibly easy relative to Cali as well. The spices really offset the sweetness nicely and make this a pretty amazing offering. To be honest, I came into this expecting some disappointment after Cali Brandy. This is a completely different beer. Wow.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"

3438,"2014-02-14",4.6,"I dont have the best nose (been punched too many times), so I couldnt tell you every little flavor that comes out in this amazing Imperial Stout. But its definitely chocolaty and boozy with almost no carbonation. Its got just the right touch of sweetness and pours like fresh oil being put into your car. It has that distinct Hunahpu bitterness to it, which is reminiscent of any imperial stout, but as CCB can only do. We were limited to 2 glasses per person (special Valentines Day tap), which was easily understandable as after 1 glass I was feeling all warm and fuzzy. For me, its hard to say whether I would choose this over the regular treatment (and cant compare to the Brandy Barrel Aged treatment since Ive never had it). Its a similar taste and mouthfeel compared to the Goose Island Bourbon County Bourbon Stout and it had no lacing on the glass, but was good and sticky sweet. I would definitely put this on the list for Hunahpus Day this year as one of the beers you need to try if you havent had it yet.","Florida, USA","Sumo813"
