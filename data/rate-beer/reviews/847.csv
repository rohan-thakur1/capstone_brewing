847,"2014-11-30",4.8,"A bomber, pours clear and a darker gold.  It has 8% ABV, stamped on the label, in a very hard to see ink.  I know the description on rate beer says 7%.  That must have been a previous, older batch.  This bad boy is 8%.  Also stamped it says it was brewed in 2014 (no month denoted), and it says 70 IBUs.  70 IBUs for a Pilsner is unheard of!  This 8% beauty is easy drinking, smells and tastes hoppy like youd imagine for an Imperial Pilsner, and goes down easily, with a clean, crisp finish.  Its lighter on the palate than an Imperial IPA.  I give this brew high ratings because it deserves it.  A dated bomber, 70 IBUs, and at a reasonable price, you cant lose.  Add in the less filling Pilsner style and it is a real winner!","San Angelo, Texas, USA","PigMine"

847,"2012-09-04",3.7,"Very mild aroma for such a hoppy pilsner...consistent but not wowing. 

Great amber appearance with amazing head retention. 

Taste was hoppy with ample caramel malt. Roast provides a toffee aftertaste. 

Palette is consistent with an imperial pilsner, but compare to My Antonia for example it's very heavy and lacks crisp feeling.

Imperial pilsners are not a frequent in the craft beer store...if you like the more refined pilsners (Heineken on steroids) this is a pleasant beer.","Texas, USA","Dchobbs"

847,"2012-02-20",3.1,"Location: 22 oz bottle from Whole Foods-Lamar (Austin), 2/20/12


Aroma: The nose is malty and grainy, smells almost like the wort, a weird nose for a finished beer

Appearance: It pours a bright golden-orange color with a nice thin white foam and fairly heavy lacing

Flavor: The taste is actually does have some depth, with grains, malts, yeast, and hops too, fairly balanced

Palate: The body is medium, it is fairly creamy and somewhat smooth, with a soft-to-average carbonation

Overall Impression: 
Despite the rather odd nose (it didnt really work for me at all), I actually enjoyed this beer a decent amount.  It has a very nice looking pour, it drinks decently, and it tastes pretty good too, but that aroma doesnt make the best first impression.  What a weird nose that is!  The rest of the beer is solid.
Update:  I wonder if I got a bad or old bottle, because I didnt see anything from anyone else about the odd nose?...","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Thats all right, though, as Ive had plenty in this style that are excessively grassy, boozy, and bitter. This is none of that- dry, malty, and toasty. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation.

Grassy and floral with some light citruses. The malts are real nice with a good amount of bread, toasted grain, and a touch of spiced caramel. Flavor is similar. Toasted grains, bready malts, and slightly spiced florals up front. A touch of caramel, a nice grass, and some biscuit before the grass grows nicely into the finish along with a slightly spiced citrus. Dry and moderately bitter with a spiced bread, floral, grassy finish before leaving a lengthy aftertaste. Medium, rounded, very soft body with a soft, moderate carbonation.

Flavors are bready, biscuity, malty and bitter (I cannot tell if there is a malt astringency as well causing some of the bitterness). A bit of an herbal note.
