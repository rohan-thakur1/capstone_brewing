2354,"2016-04-07",3.9,"Bottled 2/18/16 and drunk 3/26/16.Ruby-amber body has some darker beige notes and a large beige head that slowly recedes to cover. Good clarity, with a touch of chill-haze.Massively fruity hops in the nose combine with light notes of specialty malt (low on the iced tea here, thankfully, they add mostly some various grain/cereal notes) and plenty of vanilla-caramel character from the interaction with the base malts. Low on the ""sour"" hop element that many of their beers are prone to (really just too much bittering hop in a lot of their beers). No alcohol or flaw. Red fruits, mangoes, apples, cherries. Seems like lots of late simcoe and centennial, yet the pine expected with those is quite low, pleasantly enough.In the mouth it has an earthy/bready malt character with some softer caramel sweetness helping to balance. Fruity hops show moderate bitterness, with lemon and orange peel and light pine, but an equal, or perhaps larger portion of strawberry-mango-cherry-like playfulness and levity. Quite drinkable and very malty-soft, though not underattenuated or overly sweet. Of all the recent 3 Floyds Ive tried (permanent funeral, Cimmerian Sabertooth, wigsplitter and this) Im pretty surprised the amber ale was my favorite by a good margin (though as Chris points out, this is basically just a malty IPA, not really an amber).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

2354,"2016-03-23",3.7,"22oz bottle acquired from the brewery pickup window (Munster, IN) Surprised I had not had this one. Pours a deep carmelized copper huw, gentle haze and penny glow strike the body. Some decent bubbles cascade through the body with lively cake off white head atop. A large crown stays, laces well. Aromas show carmelized and bread malts mixing with a gentle yeastiness, firmer floral hops and some green leafy bitterness counter a bit. Jabs of citrus are fleeting as a nice balance between malt and hop is evident. Initial is lighter end of the fold, some carmelized malts, a bit of bread hits up front with some solid supporting hops hitting after. Earth, floral, a bit soapy.. the hops lack pizzaz but offer sufficient bitterness to make this pretty nice, fresh, bitter. Some citrus grapefruit comes on firmer in the backend, a saving grace of sorts which pushes it above a solid drinker. A bit fruity, pithy with subtle toastiness, cereal elements. Some subtle tropical appeal, a touch of body but still light enough, bitter enough, and a bit compelling to make it pretty nice. Very elegant pour, sweeter, earthy nose but a beer that really delivers as you get into it. Nice stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

2354,"2016-02-14",3.7,"22 oz bottle shared by ebone1988. The pour is a bright amber color with a bigger bright white head and some great lacing as it falls down to a bubbly white film. The aroma is pretty good. There is a big piney resin and a ton of hops. There is a lot of bitter and fruity hops and no sweet malts that you should expect in an amber. It smells awesome, but very un-stylistic. The flavor is something else. Thera is a ton of hops and bitterness. The malts are very suppressed. There is a nice wet fruitiness that is really surprising. There isn't the sweet maltiness that I was hoping from an amber. The mouth feel is thin and light with a nice bittering hop and a beautiful tropical fruitiness. It's really interesting, but not quite what I would like in amber.

Mouthfeel/body is medium, its slick and creamy with a good amount of carbonation. I thought it was a pretty good hoppy amber ale, Id like to have this one again! $9.99 a bomber.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
2354,"2015-11-10",3.4,"22oz bottle pours a hazy copper with an off white head. very hoppy and juicy amber with just the right amount of malt finish","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","olr1984"
2354,"2015-11-10",4.0,"Fresh bomber served in a tulip. The color is a cloudy amber orange with an inch of off white head that leaves nice lacing as it shrinks. Aroma is bright citrus. Oranges, grapefruit and pine resin are all there with caramel and toffee. Flavor is all oranges and grapefruit up front. There is a smooth caramel malt and maybe a little bread in the back. Its way closer to an ipa that an amber ale. Mouthfeel is sticky and finishes on the dry side. Another awesome FFF, and hands down the best artwork Ive even seen on a bottle of beer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Thechasm442"
2354,"2015-11-09",4.0,"Pours clear copper with low white head. Aroma of resin, grapefruit, peach. Taste is resin bitter, light caramel, then a rich citrus bitter finish. Light to medium bodied, smooth, with soft carbonation.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Ktwse"
2354,"2015-11-09",4.0,"Amber malt profile up-front but then transitions into more of an IPA profile of grapefruit, hops, and a little sweetness. Really nice full flavors.","","Bluegoosed"
2354,"2015-11-08",3.8,"Deep golden, almost bronze pour. Single finger head. Aroma is full of grapefruit as well as the taste. Juicy as hell, not dry at all. Slightly sweet at first, then degrades to bitter grapefruit. Very easy drinking. Medium mouth. Lace present. Full disclaimer, I dig hoppy reds.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","dinkle50"
2354,"2015-11-07",4.4,"Aroma is strong pine, hop resin and a small hint of funk. The flavor is grapefruit, citrus, malts, slight sugar sweetness, fruit and a bitter/slightly sour finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
2354,"2015-11-07",3.5,"Pours an amber/bronzy color with a small white head. Pure citrus smell. Taste follows nose with grapefruit the dominant flavor. To bad I dont like grapefruit or this would be really good. They may call this an amber ale but I think its a IPA in disguise.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","Mindwarp"

2354,"2015-10-31",3.8,"Bomber to mug. Pours deep copper with a fluffy cream head that lingers. Huge piney aroma. Med body. Piney, resin flavor dominates. Call it an amber ale, I'll put it with the great 3F DIPA's.

2354,"2015-10-31",4.1,"Yes indeed, FFFs cranks out another delicious pale ale. An interesting co-mingling of flavors....Id call it a Permanent Funeral / Zombie Dust hybrid. Plenty of aromatic citrus/bubble gum hops delivered only the way these guys can, solid malt backing and nice dry finish. Not sure on ABV but guessing less than DIPA range. Enjoy.","Prospect Heights, Illinois, USA","HopMunch"
