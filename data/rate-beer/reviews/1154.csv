1154,"2017-03-09",4.2,"On tap at Capones for the 2017 release. After having a bunch of fun in line drinking a coupe of beers, came in to a reserved table (thanks Matt) and sat down to enjoy the beer. Served fairly cold in a small snifter, side by side with Elder and Bling Pig which was pretty interesting. Younger was dryer and smoother than the other two, fairly strong resin but balanced with tangerine, melon and grapefruit along with a fairly strong malt presence. Bitterness is strong but doesnt become astringent, boozy and yummy.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"

1154,"2017-02-20",4.1,"Thanks to the anonymous donor of the sample: I have waited quite a while for this and I really wasnt sure if I would ever try a Pliny the Younger. Much as was my experience with Pliny the Elder, I understand now why this is such a defining beer for its style and even its region. Pliny the Younger is a very well executed West Coast Triple IPA, it has all the typical hop notes of a good West Coast IPA just condensed into a much more intense experience. Its almost oily from all of the hops, brimming with notes of tropical fruit, grapefruit and pine needles. I hate to say that its not my favorite Triple IPA but its certainly up there with only a handful of others worldwide that I have had the opportunity to taste.","Zurich, SWITZERLAND","derA"

Loved the nose but its the palate which is incredible. Superb mouthfeel and depth of flavor. Rich with some unfermented sugar. The bitterness is there but not overwhelming. For such a massive beer the balance is awesome. 
Tasted the Elder directly after this and it looked like a commercial IPA. The most disappointing thing about this beer is that its impossible to find an environment that you can relax, analyze and enjoy the beer.","Napa, California, USA","VinegarStroke"

Residual sweetness into a heavy body, late bitterness, not sticky, good to drink.
Lingering sweet, yet still not sticky palate.
Great balance, superb experience. 
Had this as my first beer, and it tasted like the Elder. Then after this I directly had the Elder, which was a soft simple IPA compared with this bomb.

We waited all night in line for the first Friday this went on tap in 2016, and were the third table seated. Back corner on the right - Platinum Baller Status table. Youll see us in any number of regional news sources, representing beer nerds from around the world who came just for this special beer or something like that. Pliny the Younger pours a somewhat cloudy orange-hued gold with a small eggshell colored head that laces the glass and settles into an island and ring. Notes of pine, grapefruit, caramel, florals, grass - the flavor has a more resinous, oily hop character and along with the ABV level, it just barely numbs the back of the tongue. Medium-full bodied, with a bitter, resinous, but balanced mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Excellent. Right on par with Pliny the Elder. World-class beers, both of them, and it was awesome to try them side-by-side. Ive been waiting to try this for like 8 years and finally got the chance.

I didnt think ""old"" American C hops could be this juicy and good. No sign of alcohol in the flavor but a light warming in the ears. Could just be sleep deprivation from camping in line over night.

A touch of booze. Pine hops build in the back end with a moderate bitterness.
Medium heavy. Not a sugar bomb, which I was afraid of. Medium carbonation. Glad I got to try it. Its very good. Id take a lot of things over it, especially if it avoids a trip to CA to get a taste.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

PtY pours a nearly clear golden orange color with active carbonation creating a ring of white head and ample lacing. Aroma is overall floral with a sweet fruity complexity, and slightly dank. Flavor is amazing: resinous, sweet and bitter all at the same time. Notes of tropical fruit, pine, malt and floral complexity combine to make this triple IPA worthy of the hype. For an 11% beer, the alcohol is very well masked. A memorable event to be able to try this.","","RussianDragon"

So I was getting maybe 25 of the nose. It was certainly potent enough to appreciate the aroma, perhaps a bit academically. It pours dark clear orange with no head or lace. The aroma is floral orange, honey, pine, very clean grain. The flavor is super clean intense bitterness all over, tip to back. The bitterness is drying and very long lasting. Notes of grapefruit, pine, wood, and subtle fruit sweetness weave in and out. The feel is dense. It doesnt push or hide the alcohol. While I need to have it with my full capacity and may or may not give it higher marks overall it commands respect. Its an archetype just like its smaller siblings.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","bmerz"
1154,"2014-03-14",4.8,"Appearance: dark golden. SRM about 8.5. White, creamy head with tiny and medium bubbles intermixed that disappears quickly. Lacing is good and lasting with tiny and small bubbles.

Aroma: citrus hop aroma with surprising maltiness. Floral and tart lemony. Slightly yeasty - raw bread dough.

Flavor: prominent and forward hop notes to start that balances well with maltiness. Brown sugar. Apricot. Finishes with bitter lime: zest and pith.

Mouth feel: lively prickle that lasts. Oily in texture- thick oil like olive. High viscosity.

Comments: very complex. Well- balanced overall. Balanced hop bitterness and maltiness at first that disappears and becomes malt-forward. Hops reintroduce themselves at the finish with a prominent bitter lime flavor. As the beer breathes and warms, maltiness increases. Notes of sweat begin to appear on the nose, as well.","Sacramento, ","corrobot"

Lots of aroma and hop punch, but the kicker on this beer is how well balanced it is. Tastes less bitter than Elder with more hop kick.

A - Crimson gold with a 3 finger creamy head. Fades so slow with sticky lacing.

S - Nose is similar to elder. Smells like a pine cone with a lot of sweet esthers and nutty bits as well.

T - The taste is interesting. Clearly a west coast IPA. Sweet, borderline barleywine taste and a clear booziness that separates it from other imperial IPAs. A raw rind of lemon, grapefruit and clementines is there too. Its a great beer for the abv. Thats pretty amazing about it.

M - Thick, malty and waves of hops.

O - I would actually say this is the closest to heady topper Ive ever had with slightly more booze.

russian river has done an admirable job of creating a mystique surrounding this beer which im sure they love from a marketing perspective but i, for one, am tired of their gimmick of brewing tiny batches that last for only two weeks. from a marketing standpoint i get it but from a beer lovers perspective its annoying as hell.

They refused to do so, and hung out with me and my friend Barry for quite some time. Eventually, the hot sun and very, very long line wore on them, and they went in a bit earlier than Barry and I. Fast forward a couple of hours - Barry and I got in - Wendy and Corey got us seated with them - and with Vinnie and Nat. Dear sweet Lord what an amazing day. One of the greatest experiences of my life. The beer was incredible too - If PtE is a bigger version of Blind Pig, then PtY is a bigger version of Happy Hops - and I REALLY love Happy Hops. In Brief: Big Passionfruit, white peach, nectarine, guava, and white tea - no bitterness, limited pine notes. The flavour was more of the same, but with unicorns and rainbows. Not really, but if you read my rating of Happy Hops, youll understand. This was delicate, fruity, fascinating, complex, and lovely.

1154,"2013-03-16",4.7,"After such a long quest for some PtY, I was finally able to imbibe on some of this goodness at the Bishops Collar in Philadelphia a couple weeks ago. Poured into a 4oz sampler glass (had two thanks to my wife who doesnt drink beer) - Poured beautiful clear golden with an one-finger super white head with beautiful lacing that lasted very well throughout. The intense aroma was full of citrus and floral hops along with pine. PtY had the perfect blend of hops in the nose that work very well with each other. The taste sweeter and maltier than I expected, possibly to better balance out the loads of hops this beer has. This was by far better than Pliny the Elder - by a mile. Full of grapefruit and sweet like honey. The finish has a nice citrus and resiny note on the end as well. Mouthfeel had a perfect balance with lively carbonation lasting throughout the (obviously very short) drinking session. It really brought out the smoothness and balance between the malts and hops on the tongue without the bringing out the bitterness like I thought it would have due to the Blind Pig and Pliny the Elder, so this was a pleasant surprise!

A: Melted gold coloration. Very thin head. Translucent. Clear demarcation of the legs on the glass.

N: I can smell this while holding it at chest level. Intense pineapple notes, mango, passionfruit, and a smattering of grapefruit. Caramel sweetness. Very worthy nose.

T: Massive interplay between sweet and bitter. Grapefruit gives way to some onion that is eventually defeated by earth, pine, conifer, and ash. Bitterness is a 10 on a 10 scale. This is the hoppiest beast on the market. Has the caramel of a good bourbon and some honey melon.

M: Dry and desiccating as a desert. Very sticky and washes around in the mouth. Sublime.

O: A beer like this is worth the effort of the chase if you havent had it. Clearly, this is true. Yet, as I drank the 8oz, the desire for another one diminished with each sip.

Theres no doubt that the Younger beats the bottled Elder hands down, but Elder on tap is a different story.  The bouquets are very similar, but the Younger is a little more hoppy and a little drier in the finish.

It glows a beautiful, deep, clear, orange color and produces no head, just a thin, white ring around its surface.  I usually like seeing more of a head on this style of beer, but there was something so enticing about its stunning, solid color.  Swirling the glass would immediately bring a white film to the surface, and it would dissipate just as fast as it had appeared.  The aroma is an amazing blast of pine and fresh orange peel ... though not as overpowering as I had anticipated (feared) it would be having never had a triple IPA until now.  On the palate it was full bodied, very slightly sticky, and its carbonation danced perfectly in my mouth.  The taste sealed it with a perfect bitter.  This is an intense beer that makes so many bold statements, and yet remains incredibly well balanced and so easy to drink.

Smell; grapefruit, orange rinds, citrus in general... Not as heavy on the tropical fruit as Pliny the Elder.. 

Taste; exceptionally smooth, launches right into grapefruit and citrus rinds.. Quite bitter on the finish, moreso than Elder, but certainly not comically so... Good resins and a nice bitter finish. Hides 11% exceptionally well... Smooth and no hints of alcohol or alcohol burn.

Mouthfeel; this is where younger exceeds... Perfect amount of carbonation, but you can definitely sink your teeth into this one... On the lighter side of full bodied... Bitterness plays into the finish beautifully...

Overall; a great beer, and certainly one that I am glad to have experienced, although I dont know that it was worth $1/ounce and a 45 minute wait... I can easily get Pliny the Elder and I feel like Elder is every bit as solid of a beer, and given the price and accessibility is even more enjoyable although I certainly had a great ...

Mouthfeel was perfect, not too heavy or light, the carbonation was a bit lower than most IPAs, but suited this beer just right. It really brought out the smoothness and balance between the malts & hops on the tongue without the bringing out the bitterness.

Poured into a wine glass and janded to us as we walked in the door. The beers sits tangerine shimmering, glowing orange with a half-finger silky smooth laced out off-white head. Aroma of honey, nectarine, orange, juicy hop resin, grapefruit, soft soil, lemon zest, and very slight notes of soap sups and pine. Very dry, yet soft and inviting nose. Pure grapefruit, nectarine, and even peachy bitterness. The body and mouthfeel of this beer intertwine in a dance of pure hoppy citrus flavor and juicy, supportive soft stickiness. This is the best balanced IPA I have ever tasted. Of course this beer could never live up to the outrageous hype, but it comes pretty goddamn close. This is a truly unique, rewarding beer experience.

Taste is initially of green, fresh hops, with a bitterness that slowly makes itself present, the mouth fills with pine needles and tropical fruits with a heavy bitterness behind it all. No alcohol detectable. No flaws or off-flavors. Looong finsish that makes me smile and go back for another sip....and another.

Pours a clearish red-orange with one finger of frothy white foam leaving some good lacing.  Aroma is nothing but hops with lots of nuance: grapefruit, lemon, peach, apricot, pine, flowers, tropical fruit, strawberries, soap, and some dank notes (a little cat piss and dirt).  Flavor of earthy bitter hops (grapefruit and pine stand out).  There is more and more caramel as it warms up a bit, leading to a good level of balancing sweetness...but the bitterness is the main thing here.  Quite complex flavor for a (D)IPA.  Finishes with a nice level of earthy and lightly bitter hoppiness.  Good carbonation.  The high ABV is absolutely nowhere to be found.  This is a hop bomb that is full of flavor and very easy to drink.  PtY is currently the #8 beer in the world and the #1 DIPA, according to RateBeer.

1154,"2011-03-28",5.0,"On draught at Oskar Blues Liquids and Solids in Longmont, Co. Poured into an 8oz snifter.

A: Deep gold with amber hues but more on the bright side of amber then the dark. Solid head retention that fades into a spiderweb like lacing on the glass.

S: Massive piney hops is the first aroma to hit your senses. Its as if you too a wiff of the biggest pine tree in existence and let the flavor wash over you. Touches of citrus grapefruit also take shape behind the chronic and pine notes.

T: Massive pine to match the nose. Comes across somewhat sticky and resinous but the bitter is truly there. Citrus fruit such as mango and pineapple are present but pine and chronic flavors are dominate. The malt is solid and doesnt subdue the hops but instead balances them very well.

M: Because of the prefect malt backbone this beer weighs heavy on the palate. Top of mouth is coated but the bitterness creeps from the back of the palate to the front. Citrus notes linger on the middle of the tongue and the finish just doesnt stop. Almost no booziness present.

D: Having the opportunity to taste this beer is up there with getting Superbowl tickets. Its worth the time, effort, and money. Its exceptional in all standings for what an Imperial IPA should be. Its not over hopped nor is it over malted, its perfectly balanced- just like all the beers RR does.

The aroma is much lighter than I had anticipated. The aroma is some hops mixed with a little pine and a bit of soap. 

The taste is also pretty light, much lighter than I thought it would be. It starts off a little sweet then goes to a full bitterness throughout. When you start out its a little bitter, but as your drink it, it becomes very drinkable.

The feel is medium in body, a semi dry feel, and a very lasting flavor.

The drinkablility is very high. You cant notice the 11abv but its highly drinkablility.

but I dont think its ""waiting in line for any amount of time"" great. It had a nice haze-orange appearance.
The little bit of head that was actually produced, faded away. Looks like a hazier version of the Elder, to me. 
It has an awesome citrus hop aroma. Tons of fresh orange and citrus hop just blast my olfactories. In terms of aroma,
this is amazing. Wow, this has an extremely pungent aroma. I thought it would be a bit maltier, that is - slightly more
nuanced, but it was to the point, which Im happy about. Considering its aroma, Id have to say this is pretty amazing.
I was expecting a bit more of a hop blast on my taste buds, but, quite honestly, this isnt that much better than
the Elder, considering the overall flavor. It is very delicious, and has a wonderful fresh squeezed orange juice
flavor, with a lovely citrus hop flavor that just impresses the hell out of me. The texture is a bit more oily than
the Elder, which is great. Overall, Im very happy to have tried this, but to me, the hype is a little ridiculous.

Aroma is top notch - some of the freshest notes I can remember smelling in a long time: fresh pungent pine, juicy citrus and lemon leaves.

All that I love in an IPA is released in a floral bouquet that rivals the best. Tropical fruits shine with a huge grapefruit appeal. Fresh bitter hops tease the senses. I am almost certain I am going to love this beer
And sweet baby Jesus do I ever. PtY is a face melting, tongue shredding, hop explosion. It tops the hop scale leaving most IPAs well behind in the ranks of mediocrity. Bursting with citrus glory, it is tangy and sweet displaying grapefruit and splashes of tangerine. Massive piney bitterness balances the sweet. The malt is well hidden, which is exactly how I like it. I wouldnt want any hint of malt/caramel disrupting the show. The mouthfeel is near perfect. The hops provide a sticky feel all the way through. Lively carbonation makes for a soft smooth trip down. The drinkability is incredible given its 11% ABV. The alcohol does nothing to flaunt its strength and remains in the backdrop. I had to keep reminding myself to drink slower and to take smaller sips. It taste so good I struggled to take my hand off the glass. With only one pint I had to make it last. Hands down this is one of the worlds best and deserves all the accolades.","Pennsylvania, USA","sarahmarie"

Aroma of honey, nectarine, orange rind bitterness, juicy hop resin, grapefruit, soft soil, lemon zest, and very slight notes of soap sups and pine. Very dry, yet soft and inviting nose; it is so subtle, yet so complex and layed. Pure grapefruit, nectarine, and even peachy bitterness flavors spring to life upon the tongue. The body and mouthfeel intertwine in a dance of pure hoppy citrus flavor and juicy, supportive soft stickiness. This is the best balanced , well-hopped IPA I have ever tasted.

The ethanol bitterness spoils this one a bit for me. The mouth feel is tremendous - you can roll this one around in your mouth once it warms. Hint of tartness accompanies the long bitter finish and an alcohol burn is left in the gullet. I prefer the Elder. Re-rated 2/12. EtOH bitterness is much reduced and in direct comparison to the Elder I now prefer the Younger. This year its a shade heavier and smoother, with more pine aroma and more malty sweetness in the body.

Flawless color, shimmering golden hue with a light head of white bubbles which was a sight considering a very small flow of carbonated bubbles. A very bright mouth feel with citrus that hints at freshly squeezed oranges, followed by the subtle bitterness of hops and just the slightest sting of alcohol.

A: Poured a pale apricot with a very nice, fluffy white head with loads of lacing as it goes down.

S: Bitter hops apparent from the beginning. Mostly tropical--mango and pineapple, mostly--alongside some grapefruit and other citrus notes. Not an iota of malt sweetness in the background.

T: Mango, pineapple, grapefruit, and apricot come from the hops. Apparently I need a hop break, as this one was bitter, but I didnt detect it much at all. The bitterness really complemented the fruitiness of the beer. Interesting ""fruit"" character, as the hops provided plenty of fruity characteristics without any actual sweetness.

1154,"2010-10-19",5.0,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2011 I slayed a growler of this last night with the help of the other Matt. Weapon of choice was my Stone IPA tulip. I obtained a growler in a trade with great BA. As a result of our heroic undertaking, my mind is still not firing on all cylinders, but this is the best DIPA Ive ever had and only my second straight 5.

Beer poured from a Russian River growler into a Stone IPA tulip. Beer is yellow to orange and CLEAR! The pour forms a white head about an inch to a half an inch in thickness that falls away leaving some lacing on the glass. Carbonation is moderate to high and really steady. The bubbles nucleate at the bottom of the glass mostly, beginning small but rise slowly increasing in size as they rise to the head. The head retention is good. No chill haze, beautiful color, good head dynamics, nice level of carbonation, its a beautiful beer.

Aroma is primarily a lot of hops....a lot of hops. Very citrusy with some pine notes in there. There is some sweetness, its a dominate aroma component. Its difficult but sometimes I think I can smell some alcohol but mostly I can not. For being such a huge beer, I really cant tell based on the aroma at all. The aroma is also huge. I can smell it from across the table. I found myself not even drinking it just smelling it, very complex, very big, very wonderful.

Taste time, balance. This beer hits all the parts of the palate, forward, middle and back. Obviously there is hop bitterness in the back, there is some sweetness up front, but no alcohol. Beer is medium bodied, definitely not a malt bomb like some DIPAs tend to be. There are almost fruit notes in the mid-palate. Some sweet orange or almost lime flavors. Beer finishes cleanly, leaving no aftertaste. Bitterness grows as it does with most big hoppy beers, but it does not interfere with the other flavors or drinkability.

I was going to originally rate the drinkability as a 4.5 for this beer. But I had some food between my pints of it and after some food a blew through my second pint. It is an amazingly balanced and completely wonderful IPA. At 11%, it is unlikely that I would make it my daily drinker, but it is the most dangerously drinkable 11% beer Ive ever had.

EDIT: I had this again at EBF (4 ounce pour) and compared it side by side with Pliney the Elder. I realized as Matt and I were drinking this growler that it was an important but absent variable in my review is comparing it to another beer. We drug out an Exponential Hoppiness for comparison but it wasnt the right thing to do.

At the fest I had 4 ounces of each next to each other. My wife and I both tasted each and agreed that Younger was better than Elder. It was sweeter and thicker, had more fruit notes on the palate and smells were uncomparable. The hop aroma on Younger blew the hop aroma on Elder out of the water. Im not going to write an additional review of this beer on draft, I just thought I would include these thoughts in my present review.

Pours a golden orange with red hues and a small off-white head. 

The aroma is a bit shy at first, but looses up after a while. fruity exotic hop notes of grapefruit, peaches and mango. Then, a more peppery and piny hop character with hints of tobacco takes over. Quite a lot of caramel malts is present, as well is a hint of alcohol. 

The flavor is big and intense. A wide range of flavors are present: sweet and sticky caramel malts at the base, and lots of layers of fresh hops. Exotic fruits, pine-needles, grass and resins. The finish is spectacular with a quick flare of warming alcohol, lots of bittering hops and hints of grass and peaches.

T- Wonderful. A big bright kick of juicy citrus and sharp pine flavors come through first with equal strength. A sweet malt provides the backbone for this and is completely overshadowed-but still detectable. The pine intensifies for the finish keeping the intensity of this brew up. What lingers is a slight alcohol heat and a medium strength residual rind bitterness.

P- Well carbonated. Medium weight oily body. The oiliness is wonderful but a bit of alcohol astringency can be detected also.

O- This is an absolutely wonderful DIPA that I thought I would never get the opportunity to try. Its an intense experience that goes right to the top without going over the top (as many Hop-bombs due). Its just barely kept in check.

1154,"2010-04-11",4.5,"Growler at RBWG. So glad I finally got to try this one. This one certainly lives up to the hype. This one looks and smells the part of an extremely hoppy IPA. It pours a mostly clear and glowing orange-amber color and topped by a foamy, off white head that shows good retention. The head leaves a sudsy wash of lace in its wake. The aroma is bursting with hops of the citrus and dank pine varieties. Orange, bitter grapefruit, mango, and pine resin all rush to the front and as potent as I have ever smelled. The malt base is of sweet toffee and add just enough sweetness to all hop bitterness. The flavor follows the same and is just as enticing as the nose suggests. Orange, bitter grapefruit, and pine resin bitterness from the hops rush to the forefront, but the balance of the sweet toffee malt lends to making this easy to drink. All the hops crush the palate with bitterness, but all the flavors combine to make this a really tasty brew. The body is big and viscous, and quite sticky from all the hops, but finishes off pretty clean with a nice bitter citrus finish. This is just an awesome IPA, and I hope to have it again sometime.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

Hops are the star in the flavor department. They are citric, piny and very floral. The citrus is grapefruit, orange and tangerine mixed with pineapple. The pine is dark and resiny, like sap. There is a strong malt backbone that allows this much hop flavor to come through. Is this beer balanced? I would say so, but the malt does not express the same complexity and assertiveness of the hops. That is not to say the malt isnt strong or is bad. The malt is actually wonderful. Its like a caramel cookie swirled into a fine hop tea.  The color is very close to Elder and Blind Pig, which is to say golden-amber and wonderful.

Taste is very bitter, lots of past-their-prime tropical hops, orange juice, orange peel. The 130 IBUs or whatever makes the 11% undetectable. Overall this is insanely bitter rather than fresh and fruity. Im sure that this is not in its ultra freshest state and that it would be a knock-out on tap.

My eldest son and I flew to San Fran to begin our Cali beer quest on Thursday, the day before the release.  Drove up in a rental car and got to the brewery around 1:00PM.  Was worried because the line was long and not moving.  Apparently, everyone that got in around opening at 11:00 were still inside having a good time.  After a two-hour wait, we made it into the pub and got a table.  First off, we ordered glasses of Younger.  The anticipation and hype were so high, I was hoping I wouldnt be disappointed.  We werent.  This brew is magical.  Simply heavenly.  It pours a beautiful golden with a thin white head.  The nose was of grass and pine and just about perfect.  The taste.

T - Mostly a malty sweetness mixed with a large amount of hops. The hops are def there, but its not overdone. A nice bitter finish. 

M - Light, smooth, clean finish. Nice carbonation, just frothy enough to let you know its there but not enough to take away from the beer itself. 

D - So so easy to drink, its scary! Probably wont have another glass until 2011 unless I get lucky again.

I wasnt totally blown away by this beer as some others are. Its as good as Elder, probably neck and neck. Would have been nice to have them both for a side by side. I think I prefer Elder to Younger...","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"

The alcohol came through more then I like but it was not over whelming, very good for 11%.  Low carbonation and thick feel.

Whatever happened though was definitely worth all the trouble and agony. Hop profile is incredibly dynamic and diverse. It keeps a nice balance all the way through though as well despite being so overly hopped up. Grassy and citrus aroma.

Pours a crystal clear, golden body with a creamy, finger-width, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a veil of lacing throughout the session. The aroma is incredible. Tons of fresh, dank, oily hops. Resiny pines, sweet citrus, passion fruit, mango, florals, dense earth, herbs, and melons with a touch of caramel. A fantastic aroma. Flavor is a hop explosion as well and fairly sweet. Tons of bright, piney, grassy citruses, wet and dank earth, flowery tropical fruits, resins, a touch of honey, and a decent amount of caramel. Finishes dry and bitter with a very lengthy, oily, and resiny aftertaste. Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Not a bad balance at all for such an explosion of hops and no hint of alcohol until a slight warmth shows up in the throat. Overall, this definitely lives up to the hype.

1154,"2010-02-28",4.8,"Thanks Joey for this opportunity! Pours deep orange with thin but lasting white head.  Got a nice side by side pour with Pliny the Elder.  First though, the aroma is HUGE citrusy hops, can almost chew them from the smell.  Hints of orange, grapefruit, pine, resin throughout.  Taste is terrific, huge resin, pine, and citrus hops intermingle well to give a bit of sweetness, leads into a bit of caramel sweetness that lasts fairly long.  Ending is a bit dry and leaves a lasting bitterness in your mouth.  And there is no alcohol in the taste, totally hidden.  Awesome brew, best of the style Ive had yet.  

Side by side with Pliny the Elder, colors are very similar, if anything PTY is a bit darker/fuller.  Aroma is the similar types of hops, but the taste is definitely different.  A thinner taste from PTE with not as much balancing sweetness and a more harsh bitter differs from PTY which is a bit sweeter and more well balanced. Different, but both excellent brews.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"

This was definitely worth the anticipation.  Has a great taste, creamy smooth balance of bitter and sweet.  Notes of citrus.  I think what separates this imperial from other imperials is the creaminess.  I love the harsh hop bitters in imperials but the complex flavors here are balanced so well to reduce that harshness.

Uber fresh dank oily hop aroma that is very floral with a lot of sweet citrus notes balancing out the earthy pine. Slight malt presence and a somewhat strong alcohol character. The high ABV is noticeable in he nose and takes away from the hops a bit.

Chewy full body, especially for the style, that is bursting with uber fresh earthy piny and sweet citrus hops. Very floral with lots of lemon peel and grapefruit as well as some tropical mango and pineapple. There is a slight malt backbone providing some balance but this beer is all about the hops.

I got my hands on two 10oz. glasses and took it all in. Light clear golden in appearance, with a thick white head. Aroma of big pine, citrus and grasses. Practically the entire range of hop aromas are releasing from my glass at one time. Smells delicious, and I have a cold!!! No detection of malts here. The warming effect from massive alcohol intake balances with what would be a palate crusher on bitterness without. Due to this, there are more and more hop nuances coming in as flavor waves throughout my session. Swirling Younger against my palate for at least 60 seconds produces no alcoholic sting whatsoever. What does come from it is a nicely marked light orange flavor sweetness than sipping it cold. Dry hops and florals stay resilient through the lingering finish. At this point I looked around the bar and found that I was the last person to have another full 10oz. glass left. And what perfect timing that Younger gets tapped right as I continue on to my 300th rating! Drinkability: Lives up to the anticipation. Currently my highest rating to date. Pairing: Water.

The taste is pretty hoppy but even balanced with a mellow fruity flavor. There are just a few fruits that cam into mind as I tasted this. A nice banana flavor with some grapefruit flavor mixed with a bit of melon. A wonderful fruit experience.

The feel of this beer is pretty mellow. There is a few points that come out to pronounce themselves but there seems to be less of a kick to the Younger than the Elder and I was really happy to say I was a able to take my time with this beer and enjoy it.

The first thing I notice at the cracking of the growler, was the hiss and the aromas of fresh hops. Big pine and cat piss (LOL) along with citrus and grasses. There is a wide rage of hop aromas coming from this one. One of the best noses from a DIPA I have ever smelled.
The flavor can best be described as Elder on steroids. I dont know if its the malts that add balanced to this hop forward brew, or the alcohol warmth. There is a nice light orange flavor sweetness coming from the elixir. With the hop dryness holding back the alcohol warmth in the end. The brew has a medium feel to it with surprisingly good carbonation to it for a growler. A true testament to Derek stately care of this one.

Well I have a growler of this one to cherish for the whole day, and I didnt even have to stand in line at the EBF for it. I will make a few calls to see if anyone want to help finish this but I wont be to sad if I cant find anyone ;-) 
I do know I wont be driving too much today though. Final thoughts... As an east coast guy I wish it was a little more balanced, but it is true to form for an west coast DIPA

FUERTE and aggressive but intimate at the same time.  It may have almost been a little much for me which is why I didnt rate it higher.

This beer absolutely has the market cornered when it comes to balance both in aroma and in flavor.  The nose is powerful but not at all overpowering, beautiful hop profile, starts with flowery piney grassy notes which are shortly followed by balanced notes of citrus, pineapple, peach, caramel and toffee.  Full body with a smooth, silky mouthfeel with ample carbonation.  The flavor of this is really a celebration of hops, primary resinous notes of pine and grass on a strong toffee/caramel background and perfectly blended with big notes of citrus and peach.  Overall slightly sweet with medium hop bitterness and very well hidden alcohol.  Finishes with a very clean mouthfeel somewhat sticky and a decent amount of lingering bitterness.

But that is not to say that a good pint of PtE isnt just as good, with a tenth of the amount of trouble to get.  Aroma is hugely hoppy, lots of grapefruit, tropical fruits, lemon zest, wonderful.  Mouthfeel is fairly full as far as DIPAs go, almost a bit oily.  Flavor starts and finishes with the most rounded, balanced yet assertive hop assault Ive ever tasted.  Alcohol adds heft to this beer, but is not intrusive. Excellent, but as a complete drinker Ill give the edge to Elder overall.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"
1154,"2010-02-16",4.2,"Growler shared by mreusch. Pour is a light hazed golden yellow with a one inch white head. Aroma of dank, fresh, resinous hops and a nice caramel biscuit malt balanced in. The hops are super fresh, super soft, just throwing off a ton of hop oil. Taste is immediately the resinous, big, leafy hops, along with a bright malty sweetness and evident alcohol. Taste is brash and hoppy, bright and resiny sweet. Not as balanced as the nose, but I am sure this is exactly what they intended. Palate is medium, perhaps even a touch towards light bodied. Carbonation is just right, with a dry finish - with residual alcohol heat along with the oily resins of the hops.  This is certainly a hop bomb, but also has a nice malt backbone so it came off balanced nicely.  Thanks for sharing this rare one Matt, it was really a lot of fun to try.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

Aroma of hops and some more hops and little more hops.  For a triple IPA though, this beer is amazingly smooth.  A bit oily, but very drinkable and a very pleasant beer.  Finishes very bitter with a hint of sweetness - not too harsh - just about right for this type of beer.  The ratings most likely are boosted by the difficulty in finding the beer and the mystique around it, but it truly is an amazing beer - able to pack all those wonderful hop flavors into a drink that is able to contain the bitterness in a smooth, drinkable beer.","Orange, California, USA","Blake"

Flavor is remarkably hoppy with citrus, pine, some metallic character from the alcohol, and a huge bitterness at the end with the malt just barely keeping it together.

A - A beautiful orange/copper tone with minimal head but amazing lacing that lasted the whole glass. A darker orange color than that of its uncle.

S - Chocked full of piney aroma! Compared with the Elder it was far more hop aroma, grapefruit, citrus and pine just fills your nose! Absolutely beautiful smell!

T - Grapefruit, pine and citrus; just as the scent would allude to! Bitter! But, not over the top (believe it or not). It was a well balanced bitterness, no funny facial expressions after taking a sip of this beer. Insanely flavorful and potent! Some beers youll need a few sips to get the flavor, this one is not that! If youre offered a sip of the Younger, take it and youll know how it tastes! No new flavors come through near the end!

M - Medium bodied, nice carbonation that creates a little dance party on your tongue. The finish sticks around too, which I really enjoy in good beers. Its a shame when they go away quickly, the Younger does not do this!

D - 2 friends came over and we had the growler gone in less than an hour! 11% so be careful! This is no harder to drink than Blind Pig or Pliny the Elder! Amazing for such a big beer!

1154,"2010-02-08",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2010 Multiple draught and growler samples over the past weekend.   First sip last friday at the release day which was supposed to be the start of a release week, though things didnt exactly work out that way.   Walking into the Russian River brewpub, the aroma hits you at once.   Yes, you heard correctly; I just rated the aroma by entering the room.   Elder is probably my favorite DIPA, so a side-by-side was necessary to really get a feel for its larger nephew.   The color is a deep gold, going a touch darker than Elder.   The head is small, with some sticky white foam lingering in a slick.   Oddly enough, at first, Elder has a much more expressive aroma, leaning on more pine and pungent dankness.   I do a double take on Younger: there is a touch of alcohol and orange showing but it seems pretty closed.   Temperature is definitely key with this beer.   Many larger DIPAs (or TIPAs in this case) seem to benefit from a cooler serving temperature that lets the hops keep the upper hand over the malt sweetness.   Younger breaks that mold because it is about as dry as you can get and still maintain balance in a beer this big.   I have heard that it has been sweeter in past years, but cant say firsthand how this years release compares.   All that I can say is that the sweetness never becomes at all bothersome.   Sure, it is evident when compared right next to Elder, which elegantly shows how dry the style can be, but it works perfectly with the massive hop load.   Let the temperature come up a few degrees, and the hops become incredibly juicy and expressive, showing all kinds of orange, mango, and grapefruit.   There is a similar resiny dank touch as you get in elder, but it is overall rounder, fruitier, and juicier, probably helped in part be the additional perception of sweetness.   The flavor is just crazy hoppy without being at all abrasive.   This is one amazingly smooth beer, with just a hint of alcohol in the finish to remind you that it is nearly eleven percent full of it.   Bitterness is almost mild to start, only building to full strength toward the back of the tongue.   Mildly malty and sweet, but its pretty damn had to pick out much definable malt character over all the hops.   Medium-full body with smooth carbonation.   Just about the perfect consistency for a beer like this, with the hop oils contributing as much mouthfeel as anything else.   Younger has a surprising amount of subtlety and balance for a beer this big and hoppy.   It definitely has more nuance than most big DIPAs, and may even be a touch understated.   In the end, it works perfectly just like Elder works perfectly, just from a different approach.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

1154,"2010-02-05",4.0,"Tap at RR. Appears a rich deep orange, tiny thin ivory head. Aroma is not as vibrant as I expected. Its pleasant though; oranges and of course a healthy dose of piney hops being prevalant. Flavor was as robust as anticipated, however. The sheer concentrated force of the hops really does blast your palate. Probably the hoppiest thing Ive ever tasted. The hoppiness is so concentrated that it becomes spicy-hot because of the resins left about the palate. Medium-sweet, pleasant malt background. Grapefruits and other citrus are present beneath the resinous hop assault. Smooth mouthfeel, thicker viscosity, creamy mouthfeel actually. Dry finish too. I would have again over and over if available and bottled, or if released more often, even at a premium price. RR are you listening? Overall, excellent.","California, USA","Gypsy19"

Draught @ Bottleworks:   I must say, the nose seems more vibrant and floral, with more candied citrus peel than I had at first.   Warming 11% ABV, but not hot.   Seems like pure hop juice on the exit, but its not terribly biting.   Certainly hoppy, bright, and vibrant, with a decent malt base.   I still wish it were a little more malty, like a borderline Barley Wine, but this is still damn good and one that I think most others wished they brewed.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"

1154,"2009-05-22",3.9,"Amber orange, with a fluffy white head.  Heavy, beautiful hop aroma.  Bitter flavor.  A bit of sweetness and alcohol.  Yes, this is very hoppy - theres a little bit of citrus, more noticeable floral and pine elements - but the bitterness overwhelms.  Full and heavy - very slow drinking.

This is now the most offensive, bitter, chewy, abrasive, theoretical IPAs Ive had, and I applaud the effort and hype.  The aroma is intense and intimidating.  The waft of alcohol is met and overcome with dry leafy hops, like I buried my face in the samples given during a brewery tour.  Clear gold, nice fluffy head, but nothing abundant here.  Its all flavor.  Ive heard that you cant discern above a certain IBU rating.  Then how do you explain this?  Its like you soaked beer in hops and then pressed the pellets to get all of their oily goodness out.  I love the high stimulation this insanely clean bitter beer brings.  Never did I think this was astringent.  But it made me question my comfort level.  And I love that in a beer.","Bothell, Washington, USA","scrizzz"

I could sit and sniff this for quite awhile and be content.  Slightly sweet and a tiny bit malty up front, but quickly changes over to hop dominanted.  Finishes nicely bitter and pretty dry.  It has an amazingly robust hop profile.  Very drinkable for 11% ABV.  Sweet nectar of life.  Drinking this makes me want to move to Santa Rosa with Joey.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","coharahawk"

Tastes just like Hop-15. Lots of piney hops, not much citrus, very sweet on the lips, but extremely bitter. I prefer dry and bitter, not sweet and bitter, but maybe this beer just isnt for me.
Not that hot with alcohol, but will warm your cheeks a little. And left a less than pleasant earthy film on my tongue.

Strong nose of hoppy citrusy grapefruit hit me as the waitress approached. As I nursed it along, the 11% abv also became much more noticeable.

Man Im glad I got to this event early enough to get a sample because who wouldve thought almost a hundred ber geeks would come out at 10:00 AM on a Sunday for a couple of west coast brews?? Aroma on this one is so much over the top hops that it actually takes on a spicey peppery aroma. The orange bodied elixir with the small white head looked incredibly  appealing in the small snifter. I do however wish that the snifter was several ounces bigger just so I could have swirled it around to really release that hoppy aroma. Flavor is smack you in the mouth bitter hops that actually is on the harsh side. The hops are so hoppy that the palate is dried out.

Taste is a hop assault, citrus grapefruit hops start the siege on your palate followed by some pine hops, a sweet, sticky malt backbone is apparent, but it take a back seat to the over the top hops. Finish is dry, pine/floral hops and a slight note of some alcohol, but not enough to convince you that it is 11%. Well worth it.","Ocean County, New Jersey, USA","pineypower"

S: Holy hops batman! This baby is pure hop juice. Huge hop aroma with wonderful scents jumping out at you. Juicy orange and sweet apricot play well with peach and grapefruit. Green grass cuts through along with an absolute bouquet of flowers.

T: The malt in this beer must be ridiculous for the balance to be so spot on despite the insane amount of hops. Nice sweet caramel malt peeks through but trust me there is much more going on here in the malt department. That being said it has no chance to shine. The hops plow through with the malt doing its best just to provide balance... which it does quite nicely. The hop flavors are like nothing I have ever tasted. Sweet, Citrus, and Floral are all there. Sun sweet apricot and peach really stand out with notes of sweet mango. The green grass cuts through and seems to duel with sweet orange and bitter grapefruit. To call this beer complex would be an understatement. To call it great would be a crime. It is sooo much more and even better I could ever imagine.

M: Full bodied, rich, thick, smooth. It coats the mouth and throat with sweet and bitter fruit that just lingers and lingers. Pure sex in a bottle. 

D: I had two full glasses and if there had been more I would have had a third. That being said I was fine drinking all the beers at the tasting. When finished with this one I was bombed, yet there was no hint of the ABV in the flavor.

How: Growler at post-EBF 2009 tasting.  Huge thanks to Nelson (tertons) again
The look: Almost clear dark orange body topped by a small off-white head
In long: Enormous nose of American hops like Ive rarely seen (or smelled), citrus fruits, pine-needles, oranges, grapefruits, name it  Unfortunately some alcohol fumes too.  Taste is what you expect.  A hop extravaganza.  Dry honey/caramel and notes of coniferous and cedar join the aforementioned flavours.  As excellent as it might be the body lacks oomph to balance the over-the-top hopping and support the high abv.  Alcohol is apparent.  One of the best American hops fix Ive ever had, maybe in my top-10.  If your thing is being slapped in the mouth with hops, more hops, alcohol and even more hops then this is probably the best IIPA you can find.  But if like me you like extra-hoppy beer without sacrificing the body/balance and drinkability than the Elder is still the way to go.  I want this in bottles dammit!!!

Moderately sweet, crispy entry with some light caramel and a bit of citrus fruit (orange and tangerine mostly) leads into a moderately leafy, bitter hoppiness with some pine and an over-powering astrigency that lingers after the finishes with a light undertone of caramel.  Solid mouthfeel and decent bitterness, but the astringency again detracts for the palate.

Truly, ONE.....singular sensation, every lovely sip I take!!!","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"
1154,"2009-02-25",4.5,"On draft at Brouwers. Pours a hazy bright orange with very little head. Smells like a hop flower was picked and crushed under my nose. Some malty sweetness - just enough to counter - but this brew is absolutely all about the hops. Mandarin and grapefruit notes dominate. Mouthfeel is thick, nearly syrupy - coats your mouth beautifully and leaves you salivating. Good God this is hoppy. Bitter aftertaste as the sweetness fades, but all around, this is an absolutely delicious brew.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

This was my breakfast in bed at EBF, as i laid in bed with the covers half on inhaling the sweet nectar aroma of this delicious IPA, it was an incredible start to an awesome festival.  Pours a honey amber body.  I could smell this all day like the elder.  A brilliant grapefruit, citrus aromatic character with hints of pine and alcohol.  Fragrant floral hoppiness, citrus and pear and no disgusting caramel malt bill, just beautiful bouquet of hoppiness.  A mild etoh warming puts this one a hair away from perfection.

Honestly I think the Elder is better. This didnt seem to add hoppy value, only alcohol. A delicious IPA but the elder is better as far as Im concerned.

1154,"2009-02-20",4.6,"Poured out of a growler, shared by an extremely generous California BA, poured into a tulip.

Ive been waiting to try this one for quite a while and was pretty certain that it couldnt live up to my expectations.  The growler was full to the brim and opened with only the slightest hiss.

The pour was very good, extremely clear amber with a hefty cream-colored head that hung around on top for a while and left a bit of lacing.  A good start.

It didnt take me long to get a whiff of this beauty, with a huge floral hop kick up front, tons of pine resin especially.  There is plenty of malts in the nose to keep the hops for becoming overpowering, great balance overall.

The taste is exceptional wtih lots of the aforementioned pine hops but with some grapefruit and other citrus sweetness thrown in.  The malts provide a nice balance underneath but the finish is definitely bitter and sticky with hops.

The mouthfeel is well carbonated with lots of hop juice and a bitterness that builds up after each sip.

This beer is certainly the most drinkable 11% beer Ive ever tasted and probably one of the top few beers Ive had in recent memory.  Exceptional.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Theres also a nice foundation of smooth sweet malts from which the huge hop aromatics have been erected. The taste is much the same with tangelo, apricot and mango all seemingly oozing with pure perfectly ripe citrus-like juices. The very late addition hop flavors slowly give way to evenly smooth yet decidedly bold hop bitterness that grows right to the finish.

1154,"2009-02-14",4.5,"Growler sent down by Taverner.  This beer is THE definition of the term ""hop bomb.""  The instant that the growler is cracked, a rush of monster pine and citrus hop aroma explodes from within.  I can smell this sucker from 3 feet away.  I would swear that there were whole, freshly picked hops dripping with resin floating within if I did not know better.  Grapefruit, orange, mango, and dank, sticky pine resin are as potent as Ive ever encountered, and that is a major feat considering the heft of the underlying, smooth toffee malt base.Visually, this brew looks every bit the part of a monster IPA.  Virtually clear and shining orange-amber in color, the body is crowned by a dense, foamy, off-white head that lasts.  A sticky wash leaves sugary legging and micro-spot lacing behind.Flavors are as bold as the nose suggests, palate crushing bitterness stemming from the insane avalanche of fresh grapefruit and pine resin hops.  As bitter as it is, this is surprisingly easy to drink due to the excellent balance that the toffee malt offers.  Quite simply put, this stuff is delicious.The body is huge and viscous, appropriately sticky but finishing much cleaner than the 11% ABV suggests.  Bitter hop resin lingers for hours, yes....hours, after the finish.  Knowing that I would pay for it the next morning, I couldnt help but drink about 1/3 of a growler on my own.  I sniffed the empty growler the next morning before work just to remember how special this world class beer is.  Fantastic!","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Tropical fruit, hoppy spice and a lot of alternation between fruity citrus and brash pine.  Sticky, tooth-coating hop oils on the palate that just fill your mouth with sweet hoppy goodness.  This is like sucking on delicious alcoholic pine cones.  Very chewy, very intense and still manages to keep everything under control.  Massive bitterness, but its so damn good that I just cant stop drinking it.  I drank this much more quickly than I probably should have.

Same emphasis and a very pronounced in your face grapefruit zest. Good hop resin character too. Alcohol was very present in the flavor. Nice spicy tone because of the bitterness. Floral tones come in further down the beer, and hints of sweet fruit. Mouth is full of bitterness. Bitterness hits where there are no bitter receptors. Still very smooth and an easy drink. Watch out this one will knock you over. Great intense DIPA, if it had any more hops in it you would have to chew it.

Big, in any case. Flavor resinous, extremely bitter, despite the huge malt that tries so hard to balance it out. I must say its a bit on the hot side, but theres so much else here that Im more noting than complaining.

Sometimes a beer kept in such high regard can falter when actually faced with reality. This beer somehow became even better than the old stories I had heard for years befor having the chance to try it out. 

The same DNA as the ""Elder"" but richer, velvity, and the best finish Ive ever experienced with a beer ever.

Not quite as crazy as I expected, actually, this is up there for one of the most drinkable big beers out there.  I cant think of anything that beats it.  At 11%, this stuff is very dangerous.

S- Smell is very piney, some deep sweet malt notes, reminescent of Pliny the Elder but much bigger with hints of alcohol.

T- Taste is phenomenal. A very complex IPA, a boquet of piney, floral hops, big malt backbone, hard to describe but everything you could ask for in a triple IPA and more.

M- Mouthfeel is thick with carbonation a bit on the low side which suits this brew.

Plenty of hoppy goodness on the palate, fruity, citrusy really fresh tasting. Malts bringing up the back with a touch of alc. to keep things warm though not in an 11%!! kind of way.

The flavor was pretty crisp, the hops were quite abundant as expected.  More piney than fruity id say overall although there were semblances of both in the flavor.  Balanced pretty nicely for a big brew, the big alcohol was masked proficiently, with only a slight heat burn as it went down.  Good hop bitterness in the finish and lingering aftertaste.

It is ALMOST as expected. A bit clean too balanced ( i prefer total hop-bombs), but otherwise near perfect. Lots of flavors in this one. Starts with some sweet orange, apricot, mango..then some pine, grapefruit, lemon, and finishes with some tangerine that rides on a solid malt backbone. BOdy is full, carbonation is perfect. The beer is close to flawless...the only thing i would like more of is flavoring/aroma hops...but then again i NEVER get enough of those except when i add a pound of finishing hops in my own homebrews. What commercial brewer could afford to do that?! For a commercial DIPA, this is about as good as it gets. Now my goal has changed from just trying this, to trying it on tap,lol..gotta have something to live for, right? An outstanding worldclass Imp IPA!! Oh, and 11% abv? Are you kidding?

Loads of freshly zested citrus. Cut flowers, wet grass, mint and a touch of sweeter caramel malt. Pours full, bright copper with a decent sized white head leaving only average lacing. Plenty of oily, viscous and rich piney hops on the tongue.  Bitter, but restrained. This isnt a palate shredder.

Also something slightly cheesy, as a young fresh hard cheese, laced with oranges and kumquats. Orange marmalade, extremely intense as taste, with an extra aromatic component as from fresh lytchees - yeast feature? Sweet, bitter and even a (citrussy) sour glimpse. Perfect balance. After some time, theres a noted resiny flavour retronasal, as from a tree as cypress or Douglas fir. Slick, well-bodied; extremely long, slightly burning, bitter aftertaste and mouthfeel.

I took my time with this.   Poured a hazy gold tending toward orange with a soap suds head that left big chucks of lacing. Huge citrus hops nose, and a rich mouthfeel that feels like port wine on the palate.    Flavors are citrus hops and the finish is long and bitter, but enjoyably so.

A bright white head has excellent staying power. the aroma is very strong, of grapefruit, pine needles, apricots, oranges and rambunctious, sweet, lightly toasted grains. Lesser notes of mango and pineapple round out a stunning nose. The flavor is maltier than the aroma and showcases masterful balance. How so much flavor is packed into each sip Ill always wonder. Bitterness is high but not the least bit astringent. Sweetness is mild, but theres enough to balance the bitterness. Acidity is very low. Toasted grains are seemlessly integrated into the taste. The flavor of the hops far outweighs the bitterness and leaves a satisfactory burning upon swallowing. The finish is bitter, semi-dry, very long and very smooth.

Nice hoppy aroma of grapefruit/citrus, floral, and pine.  Flavor is a noticable hops bite that lingers a bit.  Palate is full, creamy and medium carbonation.  Not super fresh, so the edge is off a bit; would like to try it again with less age on it.  In either case, this is another awesome RR creation!   9/4/8/4/18=4.3

Update from a fresh growler, with a big thanks to DwnTwnBwn from over on BA.  The freshness on this is an amazing hop bomb with tons of resin, floral, and overall just a fantastic nose.  The flavor pushes the oily, resiny hops right to the edge yet manages to remain with just enough gentle caramel malt balance to work very well, along with just a hint of alcohol that remains complimentary.  Wow, this one really does the trick for me, and the fresh growler pushes this to the top of my favorite DIPAs, thanks again Blake!","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"

This nectar is unbelievable.  Even after some of the worlds greatest Double India Pale Ales, i mean the BEST, this stuff is exceptional!

Pours a very nice pale golden color,  just what an IPA [double or triple in my book}  Perfect head!  great lacing!  [OK sorry about the exclamation points, but come on this is the best!!]

Great hoppy aroma.

Perfect balance,  [Huge beer of course but...]  big malt to go with the bitter hops.

      [My local brewer makes a great triple, that actually come pretty close to this and some day some how i need to get this Pliny the Younger and Buzzsaw together!]

1154,"2007-05-11",4.3,"Draught. Plain, golden-orange body with a little white head. The aroma doesn’t give up a whole lot, sure it’s really grape-ish AND grapefruity but not immensly expressive. Full, chewy fruit flavour. The hops are really thick and rich and alcohol actually appears in a late finish along with sheets of hop resin. It’s not overly bitter, just very hoppy and well balanced, surprisingly so, considering the specs.
I could probably drink several pints of this - until the alcohol kicked in of course.

Hand-bottled bomber from Dickonsonbeer at CL RB tasting. Huge hop aroma, grapefruit, sucrose, grass, really gigantic and a perfect window for the hop oils to do their thing. Unfortunately, the hops are over-bitter in the mouth, and provide little body. Notes of mint, rum, grass. A very young beer. This really is a beer designed to showcase hops and nothing else, but the lack of body and the greenness of it were a bit of a let down.

The aroma is pure hop oils and pine. Its like having hops in you hands and crushing out the resins between your fingers. Has the pure hop-oil flavor as well without being overly bitter or chaotic. Lemony citrus notes are everywhere, along with a fresh & sweet apricot background. Theres just enough malt to make this hop-juice quaff-able, and the alcohol is well hidden.

Flavor is sweet and bursting with similar hop flavors. Bitter, but no bite to speak of. Alcohol is evident, but 11% is a stretch.

1154,"2007-04-05",4.2,"On tap at the Toronado. After drinking Pliny the Elder too many times to count, I finally came across the much heralded and harder to find Pliny the Younger on tap. Like the Elder, the Younger pours beautifully with a clean, coppery orange and a nice two-finger head. The smell is pungent with citrus/grapefruit hops, but with less of the sweet pine and floral character you sometimes find in the other good IIPAs. Not a bad thing - just different and you know this one is going to hit you big time with the bitter end of the hops. Flavor is dominated by grapefruity bitterness, but kept in check with a biscuity malt. Mouthfeel is medium and fairly smooth for such a big  beer. My only real complaint is I find this beer to be a little more astringent and hot with alcohol on the finish than I like. Where the Elder is the epitome of balance for me, I find this one a bit unbalanced. Some like this, but to me it makes this a ""have a pint and then Im done with it"" kinda beer. Another excellent effort by Vinnie, the Yoda of IPAs, but Id rather hook myself up to an I.V. of the Elder for the night!","San Diego, California, USA","alohaC"

RR Tap Obriens 1/30/09.

On tap at OBriens in San Diego, on 1/19/07.  This was a special batch of the Younger for the 13th anniversary of the pub.  Poured pale yellow with no head just little islands of foam circling around.  There was basically no aroma for this brew which surprised me.  The taste is essentially pure hops.  The brew has a very fresh tasting sweet and strong hop flavor.  There is also a lot of citrus and a deep throat burn connected to the potentcy of the brew.  This is certainly a great beer, Im glad I made the trip out early to the pub to get my mouth on it.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"

Ive not had the Dreadnaught, but it is hard for me to imagine a better DIPA.

Flavor: Definitely lots of hop bitters but the hop flavors are immense and complex ... everything. The malt background is big enough to make the hop flavors juicy and explosive. Yum!!!
Mouthfeel: For a big beer, this is incredibly light on the palate finishing clean allowing the juicy hop flavors dance.
Overall: An incredible treat, it is a treasure worth seeking out. Does make sense to use the word Balance here... but it is undeniable, the mouthfeel, the hop flavors and malt in supporting role and clean fermentation. Hop ecstasy in a glass :)

The pour was a beautiful golden creamy amber with a half-inch white head. The aroma of this beer is second to none and I could not get enough. Very floral , honey-sweet, and full of hops. The flavor was sweet, citrusy and hoppy which perfectly masked the 11% ABV. The finish is very tight, and although lasting, does not linger unecessarily like some imperial IPAs.

1154,"2006-03-09",3.9,"3/8/06.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, bought in growler at Russian River Brewing Co. in Santa Rosa, CA 1/28/06.  Hand-bottled.  I hate this ""Triple IPA"" thing.  I almost want to downgrade my rating for this beer because it calls itself one; just cant bring myself to do it.  A stately gold-orange color foretells the presence of juicy hops and fruit nectar.  Tightly formed cream-tan head with respectable if unspectacular retention and lacing.  Aroma is of stiff marmalade (stiff from oversugaring or stiff from alcohol, you decide), hypnotic grapefruit and orange, and touches of toasty, biscuity cookies.  Flavor comes off a bit brash in comparison, serving up prickly, almost puckering hop resins to go with the tangerine jam.  Its a beastly little beer, subtle only in comparison to the other monsters of the pseudo-style.  Interesting blend of alcohol into the resinous, juicy, zesty hops, serving to accentuate moreso than overshadow.  If I didnt know any better, Id almost describe the alcohol as a kind of hop.  A lingering but pithy, prickly bitterness.  Like a patch of grass so dry it has almost turned to ash, laced with a candied sugar coating.  Still a bit too gnarly for me.  I cant tell if the hop resins have left a thick, sappy film on my mouth or if the alcohol has stripped it bare.  Its been awhile since I felt a thwack like this.  Full body before with just enough carbonation and juicy citrus teases on the tongue to feign brightness.  I should have known better.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

1154,"2006-02-27",4.1,"(Draft.  2/2006).  The Younger is a nice, pale brew.  Orange in color with a relatively quickly dissipating head.

1154,"2006-02-24",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2006 Pliny the Younger made the journey across the country in a 22 oz. bomber, bottled from a 5 liter keg using a counterpressure filler by BA RedwoodGeorge. While the bottling was unofficial, the beer coming out of bomber was in a very good shape. The head was one finger thick, which is a little small for the style, but it did stay put for a good little while. The underlying body was clear pale orange, and well carbonated. The looks were classic DIPA, while aroma took the style up a few notches. The smell was enticingly grapefruity, and peppery, with a very sweet smelling malt backbone. The juiciness of the smell was certainly mouth watering, and the taste did not disappoint. Quite citric and pungent, the hop laden flavor was cut by a lot of malt sweetness. The low perceived bitterness and well hidden alcohol made for an easy to drink brew. The mouthfeel was sticky, minerally, and thick, with a peppercorn zest in the aftertaste. With so much to enjoy in each sip, there was nothing to complain about the time that I had draining my imperial pint. The alcohol only became evident as the beer came near room temperature, but never did it feel like an obtrusive spoilsport. This drank much easier than the 10.5% strength it possessed would have suggested. A craft brewing masterpiece that deserves all the hype it gets. This beer was big, but still in a very delicate state of balance. Muscular, clean, and beautiful, there was none of the sloppy flab in here found in so many big beers. A Charlize Theron among beers.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
1154,"2006-02-18",4.2,"Handbottle Aroma is fuming blast of acidic fresh spritizing strong and sour citrus of grapefruit, fresh spruce and a hint of perfumy essence. Pour is a oranged yellow rimmed clear pour, with a lacy spotted sheets on the class of clean white. Flavor is a sweet fresh grapefruit, lime and cilantro. Savory and gushing with a gentle sweet maltness that superbly comforts and carries the hops as a delicate and sumptumous hop elixir. A true ambrosia. If the malt lent a little more character, and the hops were a little more transformed into that mouth warming bready goodness, this would be a top 10. Nonetheless, its an astoundingly drinkable high alcohol brew, with all those flavors carried perfectly, yet not leaving a harsh impression on the palate.

1154,"2006-01-28",5.0,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2006 This beer is a Triple IPA by style and has 3 times the amount of hops found in Russian Rivers regular IPA, and is dry hopped 4 times. It comes in at a mighty 11% abv and the brewery states ""GOBS of BUs"" or bitterness units. I dont know how many are in this beer, but it has to be well over the 100 IBU mark. 

I am happy to say I had the pleasure of enjoying some Pliny the Younger IPA, as this beer just lives and breaths hops. It has massive hop aroma, hop flavor, and hop bitterness, and was the perfect beer to end a tasting of hoppy beers with. This is a draught only beer, that can only be found at the brewery/brewpub in Santa Rosa, and select markets in Northern and Southern California. Pliny the Younger IPA pours to a beautiful deep golden color with a thick and creamy white head, and a good bit of carbonation. The nose on this beer hits you from a mile a way. Very pungent, very zesty aromas of lemon/citrus and pine flood the nose in a major way. The smell of this beer alone is hoppier than some IPAs. The palate is firm with good pale and biscuit malt that supports wonderful, zesty, juicy grapefruit/lemon hop flavor. Pliny the Younger finishes with more zesty hop flavor up front, then ends with a mouth puckering, zesty and tangy hop bitterness that explodes on the tongue and lingers for quite some time. 

Hops, hops, and more hops. This beer is a neutron bomb of hop character. Pliny the Younger IPA is not for the timid, and is an extreme hop blast of a beer. This beer is dangerously drinkable, and all that pungent hop character masks the fact this beer is 11% abv. You could get into some real trouble if you did not drink this one in moderation, but it is one anyone who loves hops must try. A beer like this should not be matched with food. Enjoy this one slowly, and savor every drop.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

I could swim in this aroma.  Starchy and dry palate presents orange and pineapples, mildly sour - intensely dry but remaining smooth.  Incredible.

1154,"2005-09-25",3.8,"Yellow gold. Tight, small white bubbles struggle to the surface. Orange marmalade, pine needles, chamomile, hopsack, and peach fuzz aromas. Decadently thick, but its much fuzzier than it is creamy. Initially gooey with palate-hugging resins and a gentler underlay of juicy hops. Resinous viscosity delays the inevitable hop bludgeon, but thats not to say the oils havent already inflicted substantial damage to the taste buds. Sappy sweetness is overwhelming, yet the hops do retain a significant level of juicy brightness. Hops discharge a strapping sting of tannins as they climax, but the bitterness remains secondary to the explosive hop flavors. Merely a light brush of dusty malts. Odd aspirin notes dull the overall brightness and add to the disagreeable mixture of spent tealeaves and a hint of overripe tropical fruit acidity. Finishes oversweet and mushy with a citrus marmalade and honey drenched pale malt fusion as melon seeds and tangerines linger. The aroma suffers from being  one-dimensionally hoppy (once again, Amarillo is likely the culprit), and beneath that, theres some unpleasant meatiness. Flavorwise, Vinnies done a marvelous job at extracting every drop of hop flavor imagineable, but the resinous goo largely overshadows the brighter hop traits. Soidly done.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

The body is also spared milk shake thickness while still being substantial. This is excellent. I was happy to grab a second pint -- yes, it was served in pints (mistakenly?) at the brewery though I cant confirm the 11% ABV. Very close to perfection here.

The aroma is very vibrant and fresh, but also extremely dry, emphasis of an enormous and ridiculous dry hop, which we all know Vinnie has trademarked.  The body is very rich and full, giving not only malt balance, but a variety of rich malt flavors, especially caramel and toffee, along with a light fruit platter.

While I will eventually comment and rate all 13 beers on display, I simply could not wait to report on this nectar of the gods.  This beer is suprising through and through.  It has the most powerful and delectable aroma of any beer Ive tried.  Like the previous reviewer, I noted intense peach and tropical aromas.  In taste, I was surprised that this Triple IPA wasnt super bitter, it was pleasantly balanced with a sweet and creamy mouthfeel.  Since I dont consider myself a true hophead, I was shocked that this beer had so much character.  Although the alcohol, packs a punch, it is nearly indetectable while savoring the flavor.  Honestly, I cant recommend this beer hightly enough.  I only had two disappointments: that the keg ran out before I could purchase a growler of it; and that this wont be available in bottles for at least two years.  Other than that...

A chill-hazed, unfiltered, sparkling copper-gold, with some bright orange/peach tones, small bubbles rising and a large, persistent, thick-looking white head.  Lacing is present.  Aroma of tropical fruits to the max, sweet crystally/caramelly malts, though more sugars than toasted notes.  Sweet, fresh, juicy oranges, honey dough and a very floral bitterness.  Full and lasting is the aroma.  Flavor begins with a burst of tropical fruits, juicy, fresh, full of flavor and complexity.  Peaches, mangoes, pineapples, blood oranges, kiwis, tangerines and only light pininess.  Wow.  The beer is flawlessly, IMHO, balanced with malt and hops bitterness.  In fact, Id say theres much more apparent hops flavor than bitterness.  No syrupy, resinous, sharp, acidic bitter notes to make you cringe on the end.  The flavors smoothly transition between hops and malt and then back again without you even realizing it.  On the finish, I detect more floral notes from the hops, with a mint-like herbal character, subtle earthy green hops notes and just a lip-smacking malt sweetness.  Full body, with just a shade of alcohol on the end, giving a touch of belly-warming.  Creamy texture, low carbonation; the liquid tickles the tongue and you can almost taste the fuzzy hops which make this beer so delicious.  Wow.

1154,"2005-03-09",3.1,"UPDATED: JAN 6, 2006 Draught, Falling Rock. Head is white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy dark yellow. Aroma is lightly malty (cookie), moderately hoppy (grapefruit, resin), lightly yeasty (dough). with a note of alcohol. Flavor is heavily sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Have had this two or three times and just dont get the appeal of it...its got very little of interest in the aroma, and although is pretty well-balanced for the style, its nothing special for me overall.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1154,"2005-03-08",3.7,"pours golden with a whitish head.  aroma is grass clippings and citrus. syrupy mouthfeel and very bitter. so much hop to this it hurts a little. caramel peaks through the mass of hop flavor. there is a candy corn like finish with more hops to boot.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
1154,"2005-03-05",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2007 On Tap.  Pours yellow/orange with a whispy white head.  Aroma is all hops.  Pine, oranges, maybe some grapefruit and grassy.  Flavor is shockingly sweet.  Followed up by the hop assault I had originally expected.

Cask- Absolute brilliant beer!  Big hoppy aromas still but the up-front sweetness is somewhat subdued now.  Just a bit of sweetness in the aftertaste.  Over-the-top in just about every category.  I couldnt drink this beer daily but as an occasional treat its great.","Concord, California, USA","ChillCoat"
1154,"2005-02-21",4.5,"Wow! A big hop aroma: pine, grapefruit, and a slight hemp note.  The flavor was full of oranges and flowers, w/ a hint of sweetness on the back of the tongue.  The beer poured a golden orange w/ thin lasting head and lacing.  The mouthfeel was light and carbonated.","San Diego, California, USA","Hairofthedog"
1154,"2005-02-21",4.6,"Tasted at the 5th Annual Bistro 2XIPA Fest. Medium orange gold color. Medium sized white foamy head. Aroma is big piney hops, grapefruity juicy hops and citrusy. A full-bodied Tripel IPA. Malts are fruity and sweet. Hops are everywhere is this beer, citrus, grapefruit, floral, earthy and pine all blend into a very pleasant hop onslaught. It bitter, without being too biter. LOTS of fruit flavors as well. No alcohol bite at 11%. This beer will assault you with flavors, yet it still nicely balanced and smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, yet there is some residual sweetness as well.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
1154,"2005-02-13",3.4,"IT has a typical color with some autumn colors, like a leaf.  Basically the flava and aroma are straight hops n pine forest. It is too much, i think i could dust my house with this stuff.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"

1154,"2005-01-30",4.0,"(Draft: OBriens in San Diego, CA) Compared side-by-side with Pliny the Elder, and I think the young whippersnapper is schoolin the old man.  This is a very flavorful brew, big, very bitter, grapefruit-like citrus, but also quite fruity with an apparent sweet, orange citrus flavor.  Aromatic grapefruit/hoppy nose is bigger, sweeter, fruitier and more balanced than the Elder.  Thick, sticky, very sweet palate like a barleywine, but with a strong bitter bite to balance it out.  Dark golden in color and a bit hazy in appearance.  The occasional large carbonation bubble speeds to the surface.  The off-white head fades to an island of sheen.  Overall, I am very impressed with this beer, though Ive tempered my praise just a bit by comparing it with a YuleSmith, and that certainly put things in perspective.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a nice lingering sweetness. with not that much depth.  Flavors of mint, pine, honey and finishing with soap.  This is a decent beer but isnt a hop lovers wet dream, not unlike the DFH 120 min IPA.....","San Diego, California, USA","Sickboy282"
1154,"2005-01-28",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 22, 2010 People who call their beers ""triple IPAs"" should be shot for being corny losers.  Sorry Vinny, but you just went too far.  I have a degree in marketing and Im keen to these things, and yes, calling this a triple IPA is retarded.  Especially since the only thing its over the top in, is sweetness.  Anyway, its got a lacey head atop an amber body..a piney, cakeish, and thick aroma...the body exceptionally full and satisfying but overbalanced and sweet with such a firm malt background that there really isnt even enough bitterness..the hops have flavor yes, which is quite nice in fact, but the bitterness is missing and thats just wierd round here.  Its like a double IPA for non hopheads..  Is that what a triple IPA is?  Remind me to stay away from those.  Sorry, Im being a bit harsh..it aint that bad...its just not something you would call a triple IPA.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"

Honey colored brew raising a huge white head. Nose is just in your face hops which is how it should be! Flavor is rolling between piney hops and tropical fruit notes. I got peach, grapefruit,mango,pineapple and some bitter orange.Fairly well balanced and hides the 11% expertly.","Orange, California, USA","herbjones"
