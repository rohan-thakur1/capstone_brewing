4218,"2017-03-01",3.8,"Bottle share at RBBWG 2017, thanks for sharing.
Anno 2016.
Couleur rosâtre, col rosé actif et retombant vite.
Arôme est complexe avec de belles effluves de cerises et léger fleur de cerisier avec un léger rétro terreux. Le côté malté est plutôt discret.
Palais est finement fruité, cerise avec un bon caractère terreux rappelant presque une effet de framboises. Le tout est sec et bien pétillant avec une alternance entre douceur fruitée et léger acidité-aigrelet des cerises. Garde le mérite de ne pas tomber dans lusage surfait de jus de cerise.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
4218,"2017-02-28",4.0,"Top-fermented beer with sour Schaarbeekse cherries; intended to celebrate the 500th birthday of Andreas Vesalius, a prominent 16th-century anatomist. Bottle shared at RBBWG. Loose, bubbly, off-white head, quickly dissipating; hazy deep fuchsia colour with fiery ruby red hue. Aroma bursts with fresh sour cherries, raspberries, cassis, lime zest, almond, biscuit crumbs, sourdough, white bread, rosé wine, pear peel, cake. Very crisp, vividly fruity flavor, tons of sour cherries bringing a refreshing lemony acidic hint, surrounded by estery suggestions of redcurrant, raspberry and gooseberry all around, a bit more mellow and fruit yoghurty in the middle, tad soapy, smooth on a bready and lightly caramelly, rounded malt sweet backbone, cherry stones adding drying tannins in the finish while the sour cherry tartness adds further drought; juicy and utterly quenching tail. Nice, crisp, to the point, not needlessly sugared (or Stevia-ed), honest and free of technical flaws: this is not just the best Vlier beer I ever had by far, it is the first one exceeding merely regional significance. Will definitely revisit if I come across another bottle.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

4218,"2016-07-20",3.9,"The new batch, to be sold starting this summer. I was told by the beer this is somewhat sweeter than last. Also 1? lower abv. Very cool dark looks, not so clear, like it. Rich cherry aroma, but deep, almost chocolate. Not the most complex as base beer but cherry properly adds character. Good sourness but not a lambic kriek. Liked it a lot!

Aroma is cherry pips. Taste is a wincing sour cherry pie with a complex fruity character thats hard to put into words.

4218,"2014-12-09",3.9,"0.75 litre bottle: BBD 4th Dec 2016. Shared between five on 8th Dec 2014. Cheers Mat for this unexpected delight. Pours a Victoria Plum purple colour with a pink froth as a head. Tart and sour from the start, loads of cherries and then more sour cherries, yet it was drinkable and even though sour is the word I am using it had a smoothness to its sharpness if you can grasp what I am trying to say. Anyway I do not usually like kriek beers, sour or sweet, but this was a lovely beer and I may well revisit the fruit beer scene when next in Belgium because I enjoyed this so much.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

4218,"2014-10-26",4.4,"Thank you JefVerstraete! A fairly sizable portion from 750 ml. bottle consumed @ The Tasting formerly known as Mons RBBAG I (2014). BBF 04/12/2016. GUSHER. Appearance is astonishing deep purple, radiant fruit with a sadly instantly fizzing away super-dark pink head. Nose is full of cherry pits, reminiscent of Glühwein spices, reminiscent of warmed up kriek-juice (beer was cold obv. but smell still reminded me of this). Taste is thick kriek juice, almost concentrate with lots of pits, leaves & Glühwein spices, super juicy, near faint metallic minor note in the back. Thick juice-body, little carbonation. About as fruity as a beer can get, very lovely even if I cannot shake the feeling that this simply would have been better & with the necessary complexity + depth.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
4218,"2014-10-10",4.8,"UPDATED: JUN 20, 2016 Draught @ M Café, Leuven. Dark red colour, pink foam. Soft carbonation. Foam disappears quickly. Complex fruit beer. Very fruity, sour cherry, almond, green apple. Very well balanced. Tart with light sweet notes. This is very good, the best non-lambic fruit beer I ever tried! Unfortunatly this is a limited edition with only 400 bottles available. Buy it, it is very good!","Oosterzele, BELGIUM","JefVerstraete"
