2661,"2017-01-22",4.0,"Pours entirely flat, with no head to speak of, almost black, with a brighter hazelnut quality to it.

Has a prominent, wooden alcohol bite on the nose, with lots of oak and earth, toning down the spices of the barrel. A toffee note evolves from this, sweet and rustic, with a dried raisin peak and lots of toasted coconut. Pretty complex, a new aroma nuance seems to be found, everytime I put my nose in the glass. 

Drinks silk and slick with no hint of carbonation, showcasing each and every flavor quality. Its mouthfeel is medium bodied and entertaining till the last moment. 

The beers taste is not as complex as its nose, it got a defining silkness, together with a very powerful barrel, soothed by the soft mouthfeel. Chocolate pudding with some banana in it, bakers chocolate, molasses, black pepper and licorice. A charred wood bark quality sets in, together with toffee and the initially established silkness. A nice chocolate and wood defined alcohol dryness results from this, warming and flavorful with more toffee and a caramel sweet finish.

Sweet, boozy, silk and oaken, these flavors define the beer, put into perfect balance to each other due to the soothing, silk mouthfeel.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Lovely, complex aroma with signature Hair of the Dog descriptors; fig, raisin, woody oak, prune, musty leather, spicy tobacco, plentiful bourbon, earth, sweet molasses, & light touches of anise & wine. Solid battle between robust booziness & offsetting sweetness. Huge oak presence on the palate; if the ""wood"" part wasnt appreciated in the aroma, it definitely is in the flavor. Booze soaked oak staves, black cherries, dates, sweet raisins coated with burnt brown sugar, molasses, & a touch of vanilla. Middle to back, you get more of the signature old leather & tobacco flavor with a touch of earth, smoke, & vanilla. Boozy finish with a semi-sweet balance; malty, unattenuated, sweet, warming, & indefinitely intriguing. Thick body, oily & coating.

2661,"2014-07-15",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2017 The older version with a maturation time of 7 years on bourbon barrels. I cannot thank the friendly people from Hair of the Dog enough for bringing this piece of art to the world: the maturation only adds to the complexity of their regular Adam, making this one of the best beers I ever had the pleasure to taste. Thick, pale beige head, colour very dark brown, aroma infinitely complex with hints of caramel, wood, honey, raisins, liquorice, apple cider, freshly cut strawberries, candi sugar, good quality bourbon, candied dates, vanilla, and so on, and so on - this is one of those masterpieces with a bouquet that seductive that you hesitate to even drink from it, it is as if you would want to whiff the liquid instead. Drinking it, however, is equally worthwile, as this brew immediately displays a richness, complexity and profundity of taste rarely encountered, creamy, sweet but not sticky, mildly and gently spicy, incredibly malty in a multi-layered way, lively, deep and fascinating till the end, when - apart from a toasted bitterness - warm, bourbon-like alcohol comes up only to add to the sublety and complexity.

I think of bourbon soaked graham crackers Very dark brown color and a thin ring of creamy tan head. The head bubbles away quickly ad leaves a dark snifter of goodness. Silky texture, so smooth. The bourbon accentuates the dark fruits and compliments the chocolate malt. A little peat and smoke in the end. Swirling complexities, but so very balanced. Smooth. Damn good.

Malts and caramelized booze up front; bourbon makes its way in shortly thereafter. Leathery and tobacco-y too. Caramel and vanilla linger after swallowing as the alcoholic warmth soothes my throat. Superb.

2661,"2012-12-06",4.2,"Bottle shared by drabmuh. Thanks Matt.

Served with Matt, Adam, Cherry Adam from the Wood, Fred, Bourbon Fred, Doggie Claws 05.

The beer is dark brown with a thin beige cap. The aroma offers bourbon, oak - very enticing, but lacks the complexity of regular Adam. Bourbon overpowers some if the more subtle aspects of the beer. Great flavor. Melts in your mouth smooth feel with alcohol heat masterfully contained. Lingering bourbon in the aftertaste, though exceptionally soft on the palate. Overall, outstanding.

4.0 A: Pretty damn close to black in color. Two fingers of frothy/creamy tan head. Retention is pretty good for the ABV, but no lacing is left.

4.5 T: Tastes like the nose. Lots of caramel, brown sugar, raisin, tobacco. Fig, date, and plum fruits. Still a bit vinous, but not as much as the nose. Bourbon is peaty, earthy, and minimally spicy. Oak and vanilla are back. Its super complex for sure.

4.0 M: Heavy body. Thick and viscous. Chewy with a moderate creaminess. Moderate amylase coagulation going on.

Aroma is stunning with sweet caramel malts, molasses, tobacco, leather and lots of booze-soaked dark fruits.  Some raisins, plums and lots of bourbon and oak.  In short, all kinds of things going on in the nose.

The taste is more of the same - so complex.  There is an initial bourbon kick with the coconut and vanilla sweetness.  The backbone is all about the sweet caramel malts and molasses.  Sweet fruits and a dry barrel-heavy finish.

Taste is bourbon up front that has a bit of alcohol bite followed by roast, smoke, chocolate, fig, leather, a bit of malt sweetness that briefly appears on the back third, and clean bourbon through the finish.  The bourbon dominates but not so much that the regular adam is lost.  Mouth feel is spot on with a lively ebb of carbonation and a clean, relatively dry aspect to the flavor profile.

Lastly all the good stuff that makes me love aged Adam--tobacco and leather. Flavor is pretty much the same, which is far from a letdown, but adds a bit of a boozy burn and pleasant warming down the throat to the belly. The molasses is a little stronger as well. Semi-dry with a lightly roasty finish, bitterness at a 2-3. The alcohol and barrel do a pretty good job at keeping the sweetness from getting to be too much. Low carbonation with a full body.

2661,"2012-01-31",3.9,"355mL 2011ed thanks to the BA crew at SPH. Pours a clear sepia generating a denser, cappuccino head. No lacing really. Quick dissipation. Nose: oh yeah. Super tawny and old feeling, wet detritus, muted chocolate, muted peat bog. Subtle complexities with an old ale feel. Toffee, port, old Madeira. Lots of English malt character approaching something like Thomas Hardy Ale. Taste...up front it is much much sweeter than I remember typical Adam being (plums, raisins) moving to some muted alcohol heat and buttery chocolate frosting. Finish is a little bit sweet raisins, tart red wine, richer and full bodied with hints of paper that dont materialize thankfully. Very rich. Im not sure I like this better than normal Adam. The palate seems creamier and richer, but the taste is sweeter black barleywine. As it warms, I can really appreciate the complexities- oil, red wine, butter, acid. Yum. Im not sure why this stayed in barrels for SOOO long and why they picked Elijah Craig, which produces vastly inferior bourbon to say Bookers. Something smoky like Adam could do well for a short time period in a top notch Scotch barrel like Ardbeg. I would highly recommend NOT aging this since it is A) already so old, B) is slightly red wine and port tart so may gain acidity, C) is already delicious, D) can really only gain more of an old/oxidized character.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

2661,"2011-12-26",4.2,"12 oz. bottle from the 2011 batch, not long after bottling.  Ive lusted after this beer for ages, and finally we meet.  The body is extremely dark mahogany to virtually pitch black in color.  A squat head of beige froth recedes, revealing an oily, mirror-like finish strewn with random swirls, while the outer surface edges collect steadfast, foamy bubbles.  Beautiful looking beer.The aroma is stunning and complex, showing wave after wave of luscious dark malt varietals.  Dark chocolate, smoky molasses, scorched caramel, and candy sugar all come through.  Leather and tobacco impart earthy-sweet, peppery pungency, while the barrel wood offers up gorgeous vanilla tones.  Of course, there are some drk fruity tendencies as well, most notably maple-glazed dates.  The yeast seems almost creamy.  I could sniff this brew all day, but then Id never get to tasting it.Now on to just that.  The flavor is initially sweet, before quickly settling in to well balanced.  Dates, figs, and candy sugar stand out immediately, followed by waves of semi-dark chocolate and just-burnt molasses.  Countering all that sweet malt is a relatively dry yeast profile, along with surprisingly piquant wood and tobacco notes.  Luscious, ultra-smooth bourbon envelops all else, shrouding everything in a veil of soft caramel and vanilla.  Tasty, tasty stuff.Having just polished off the 2011 Bourbon Fred a few nights prior, the palate is where I thought this brew might fall short of expectations.  The first sip immediately put those fears to rest.  Though it is certainly a bit heavy and syrupy, the relatively dry yeast does a decent job with the Herculean task of keeping the sugars in check.  In fact, theres almost a touch of chalkiness at the midpoint, before settling back in to a sweet finish.  Carbonation is spot on for the style, showing a soft, lightly prickly profile that lifts the body up.  Alcoholic heat is minimal.Overall, Id call this beer a smashing success.  Its a slow sipper meant to be contemplated over a couple hours, preferably on the porch, at night, with a nice chill in the air.  So complex.  So well done.  Others will prefer this one more than I do, simply as a matter of style, but I appreciate everything about this beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

2661,"2011-10-29",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2011 
2011 vintage, fresh on draft at the brewery. 
the bourbon character is quite forward in the nose, alcohol quite noticeable, and while that typically spells trouble for me, it remains delicately nuanced as the bourbon and alcohol seem tempered by the hearty wood, tobacco, brown sugar, plum and fig malt at play in the aroma. body is full and rotund, bourbon is forward but not excessive given the weight and flavor character of the adam: still slightly smoky, lightly brine / olive-like with leather and tobacco notes lingering late, balanced with medium+ malt sweetness (more fig, plum, brown sugar, molasses). hearty, filling and warming; full and satisfying.  id stock up on bottles of this vintage.


2004 review, vintage unknown - most likely a few years old - sampled on draft at the brewery.
deep murky brown, nose is port-like and the character of adam and the oak seems to play more of a role than the bourbon (compare to 2011 review). sharp wood, moderately dry with notes of molasses, burnt plums and scotch. coating texture late with brown sugar and plum lingering.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

2661,"2011-06-08",4.6,"Appearance: On tap at HOTD tasting room. Came to me a deep, dark brown with a creamy, quickly dissipating beige head that turned into a light ring around the edges. 

Aroma: Sweet caramel, bourbon, dark fruits, chocolate, vanilla bean, old leather, and smoke. 

Flavor: Heavy bourbon up front, then moves to notes of dark fruit, peat, chocolate, and sweet vanilla. Not much flavor from the wood aging, but the bourbon sure as hell stands out! Leaves a very nice bourbon heat. 

Palate: Mouthfeel is lagging in carbonation, but still very silky smooth and drinkable. A little oxidized, but by no means enough to keep this beer down. All the flavors are so complex and well-balanced, its hard to say anything bad about this beer. 

Overall: To put it elegantly, this beer threw me into a windowless van when I was least expecting it, took me into the woods, had its way with me, and made me its bitch. No complaints from me!

Aroma is smooth dark chocolate, dark fruits, tobacco, cherry, some slight oxidation.  The overall character of the aroma is aged beer, not so much barrel influence as one would expect from a barrel aged beer that has been resting this long.  Not as much bourbon either, chocolate is the main component of the aroma.  Flavor is a deep, smooth milk chocolate.  Super creamy mouthfeel.  Low carbonation.

The look: Cloudy brown body with almost no head
In long: Intense nose of ripe dark fruits with a bit of bourbon.  Very intense nose and with less bourbon than I expected from a beer that was aged in bourbon barrels for years.  Taste starts a bit disappointing with a lack of carbonation.  I dont know how much or how little carbonation a fresh bottle had but our bottle had only sparse carbonation.  However the beer showed very little oxidation/cardboard.  Taste was ripe dark fruits, raisins, oak, vanilla, some bourbon, brown sugar, caramel, leather.  Thick body.

2661,"2008-08-07",4.1,"From a 1.5L Bottle.  Sampled at the RBSG tasting.  Pours a muddied dark brown color, topped with a thin ring of wispy off-white head.  Intense aroma, saturated with bourbon, brown sugar, and dark malt melanoidins.  Theres an intense dark fruit character that comes through as slight oxidation in the form of figs, prunes, and rummy raisins.  Hefty doses of oaky vanilla.  Medium-full bodied, softly carbonated mouthfeel.  Flavors are excellent up front, bringing out notes of chocolate nougat and raisins.  Toward the finish, the flavors get incredibly oaky, contributing a slight tannic astingency.  Faint leather and black pepper.  Finishes relatively dry and oaky with a mild alcohol warmth.  Very oaky beer overall, but delicious.  The bourbon barrel character and age have completely transformed the base beer, leaving behind only a shadow of its original self in a very faint whisper of smoke and chocolate flavors.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Tastes a little oaky, still quite smooth and creamy on the palate as well.  The vanilla/caramel mixed with the dark fruit and malt really seems to have done some nice things together.  The bourbon is there, but it really blends in well with these other flavors.  You get it alot in the finish, while the front is fruitier and sharper.  Killer.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"

A very complex aroma with hints of wood, dark fruits, and heavy dark malts.  The flavor is also deeply complex bringing out the normal Adam flavors of dark fruits, leather and tobacco, figs, prunes, and then complex it further with an oaked wood sense and peat, deepening the flavor into one very thick and rich brew.

The aroma had prune and plum along with some other difficult to place smells (likely due to how late in the tasting this was for me) though Id guess toffee or molasses and maybe vanilla.  As for the taste, the body was thick and syrupy, very heavy with nearly zero carbonation.  I noted raisons, brandy alcohol, hints of light coffee/chocolate (toffee?) and other deep flavors that escaped me.  While not my favorite, I was very excited to have tried such an elusive brew.

2661,"2004-12-24",3.8,"Like one rater said...it looks a lot like prune juice. Aroma is is of burnt caramel and toffee, sherry, peat, oak, vinous, bourbon, and yes...oak. I guess its medium to full bodied, syrupy texture, no detectable carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Taste is sweet, toffee, oak, vinous, bourbon, caramel, finishing with a medium alcohol burn.  I like it, but wish this bottle exhibited some of the light carbonation that others have experienced.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"
2661,"2004-12-23",4.5,"1996 vintage. Dark ruby-black colour with a very still body. Amazing aroma of dark molasses and whiskey. Flavour is salty, sweet, woody - notes of bourbon and cocoa. Oh so good.  [Toronto Christmas Party 04]","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
2661,"2004-12-23",4.2,"aroma of peat, alcohol, scotch, port. Appearance was deceiving because of soap like bubbles, no head. Taste barley, bourbon, salty, barrel wood. Thanks to Woolfs at Doug Shoemaker tasting. The taste, the alcohol - must be sipped. Speed bumps slowing us all down.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
2661,"2004-12-21",4.2,"Handbottled from JCW via Captain Cougar: Deep brown hue with a very oily appearance. The aroma has an Old Ale note with caramel, molasses, vanilla, juniper berries, pine, orange zest, and moderate phenols added in. Outstanding! The taste starts sweet and tart. Malty goodness balanced by the oak bourbon nature adds a wonderful depth of palate. The finish is surprisingly dry for how sweet this beer comes across initially. The feel is oily and lush with a very mild warming after a few sips. A well aged brew in which the wood works with the beer and does not dominate it.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
2661,"2004-12-20",4.1,"From the CC bottle.  Very dark brown body, zero head.  Chocolately old ale aroma with molasses wood notes.  Winey, woody flavor with alcohol spice and berry sweetness.  Wow!  I didnt describe it very well but the flavor was very intense and satisfying.  Thanks Tom!!","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
2661,"2004-12-20",4.5,"Thanks to CaptainCougar for sharing and to hopsrus for the hand bottling. Murky dark brown body, no head. EXCELLENT aroma of bourbon wood, vanilla, brown sugar, raisin. Taste is a vinous bourbon, chocolate, and charcoaled wood. Soft palate. Good stuff!","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
2661,"2004-12-20",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2005 Hand bottled, thanks CaptainCougar.This pours a very dark brown with no head. The aroma is very strong with sweet cherries, raisins, vanilla and an oak nuttiness. Also some earthy mushroom notes come out as it warms. The taste is a very strong molasses with vanilla, oak and bourbon. An alcoholic finish and a thin mouth feel. Certainly an interesting one. A little goes a long ways.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
2661,"2004-12-20",4.2,"Pours a dark brown. Aroma is incredible. Malt, alcohol, woody tones, soy sauce and molasses. Flavor is sweet woody goodness, ""a funk"" to it, barley, and sweet finish. VERY nice, Thanks to CaptainCoughar for sharing this one!","Mississippi, USA","Mangino"
2661,"2004-12-19",4.2,"1996 Vintage. Dark brown almost black w/ no carbonation. Robust, malty, bourbon-y aroma w/ notes of oak, maple, & vanilla. Thick, chewy, syrupy feel. Very complex flavour of bittersweet chocolate, toffee, licorice, bourbon, oak, & vanilla w/ a light, appetizing, astringency.","Waterdown, Ontario, CANADA","joeycapps"
2661,"2004-12-19",3.4,"dark in color w/ no head, very strong scent jumps out at you , strong alcohol and raisens in the scnet... very good.  the palate was rich smooth and creamy.  The flavor was of raisens w/ a little spic and an aftertaste I really didnt like.  Overall I loved the smell but was lacking the taste.
Thanks to Tom.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
2661,"2004-12-18",3.6,"Lifeless dark brown that coats the glass. Nice full aroma of wood, maple, smoke, brown sugar, and raisin. Fuller flavor, kind of boozy, sweet, maple, raisin, salt, and caramel. The lifeless body detracts a touch, I think some very light carbonation would have been welcome. It was quite good anyway and thank you wohlfs for allowing me to try.","Sanborn, New York, USA","IPFreely"
2661,"2004-12-17",2.7,"Dark brown coloured body with no head at all-completely still. Aroma of wood (no surprise there), roasted malt, strong toffee & caramelised sugars and pit fruits. Medium-bodied; Flat taste with molasses and brown sugar most noticeable. Not a great beer in my opinion-due to the complete lack of carbonation, but a great one to try with everyone at the party. I sampled this 1.5 litre bottle at the November RB party at Founders in Alexandria, Virginia on 20-November-2004.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
2661,"2004-12-16",4.4,"Bottle.  Really nice beer although this doesnt behave like a beer.  Very complex.  Smokey, salty in taste.  Still, not a hint of carbonation.  Rich and smooth mouthfeel.  Feels like much more alcohol than 10%.  Has wine-like legs on the side of the glass.  Thank you Alan Sprints!!!","Alabama, USA","11026"
2661,"2004-12-13",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 18, 2004 Very much like a port.  Dark brown color, with a lot of particles in it.  Aroma of a wine, maybe thats the wood character and a little smoke character from the bourbon barrels.  Very drinkable.  Little to no carbonation(right out of the bottle).   Interesting and very drinkable, but if I had seen it come out of a beer bottle, I wouldnt have guess it to be beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"
2661,"2004-12-12",3.6,"Thanks to Steve.  Astringent peaty scotchy port.  No head, superdark brown appearance.  Kinda smells like band-aids (?!?)  Very woody, smoky.  Scotch with grapes & limes, salt, alcohol.  Interesting.","Buffalo, New York, USA","rudolf"
2661,"2004-12-12",3.6,"1996 Vintage Big Honkin Bottle dated 6/96. Toronto Christmas Party 2004. Very dark brown-black headless body that coats the glass. Sweet syrupy aroma - maple?- with a touch of alcohol. Initial impression of the flavour is an intense dry bitterness. Unapproachable yet intriguing, this is the standoffish sexy brunette at the bar with an interesting accent. Slight hints of sourness throughout, particularly in the finish. Dry bitter vinuous fruity notes like a red wine. Medium to full bodied, zero carbonation. An intriguing multi layered beer that while I appreciated the complexity, I also didn’t entirely like. Thanks for the chance to try it Wohlfs, many thanks!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
2661,"2004-11-26",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 23, 2008 Bottle... This beer really rocks! ...Hazy, prune juice-looking ale with a small, quickly dissipating, tan head. Complex, malty, bourbonesque aroma with notes of molasses, oak, medium-dry sherry, toffee and caramel. The flavor is of dried plum, chocolate, bourbon, oak, sherry and well toasted brown sugar. Full-bodied and very creamy with light carbonation. Medium-length, alcoholic, dry finish. Another world class brew from HOTD!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2661,"2004-11-26",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2005 Pours dark black. Aroma is of wood, alcohol, and sticky sweet malt. Flavor is brown sugar, soy, and wood. Very very rich, I wish I could have sampled it when I was not full of beer. 
Added 03/01/05: Sampled it not full on beer. Still unbelievably rich. Very good but hard to put down more then a few ounces.","Silver Spring, Maryland, USA","jeffin7"
2661,"2004-11-23",3.9,"Sampled at the DC/MD/VA/WV/PA Ratebeer Gathering 11/20/04. Pours dark brown, disappearing head. Aroma is oaky, fruity and hoppy. Taste has notes of roasted malt, smoke, some dark fruit, brown sugar with  oak, bourbon. Some sourness in there too. Couldnt detect any carbonation in this. Glad I got to give this one a shot.","Ashburn, Virginia, USA","jasonp"
2661,"2004-11-23",3.6,"Magnum bottle at the Gathering.  Pours an extremely dark brown/black with violet/burgundy tinges on the edges and little head retention.  Cloudy and bottle conditioned.  Aroma of stiff barley grain, alcohol, oak, a touch of smokiness and some roast, as well as some woody/cork notes.  Light vinous notes as well.  Flavor is lightly sweet at the start, with more of the dry wine-like qualities, or perhaps more like sour, concord grape juice.  It remains mostly dry and moderately sour through the body which is medium-full and ends with a touch of chocolate, lots of yeast and alcohol.  Strong oak notes linger on.  Lightly oxidized palate, though it has held up very well.  Somewhat of an acidic palate which I didnt care for.  I really enjoyed most the lack of carbonation in this one.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
2661,"2004-11-23",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2005 Cloudy brown with more oak than ale in the aroma. Taste is overpowering alcohol, oak and toffee. I was expecting more. I dont think the age helps too much.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"

2661,"2004-11-22",3.5,"Deep brown-red.  Very dark.  Nose rich and salty, the second beer that day I got kalamata olives off of.  Flavor rich and woody, very oaky, some molasses, but doesnt really taste like Adam.  Carbonation was regrettably gone in this one.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
2661,"2004-11-22",4.2,"Magnum bottle - DC/MD/VA gathering.  Deep dark brown, bordering black, no visible head.  Tons of oak, wood, whiskey and vanilla jump out upon first smell.  Then as it settles, big vinous notes, brown sugar and molasses bring up the rear.  Taste matched aroma with  additional notes of dried cherry and roasty caramel.  Medium bodied with very little carbonation, tangy, woodsy finish.   Glad to have an opportunity to try this.  I loved it, but it certainly is not for everyone....","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
2661,"2004-11-21",4.0,"Poured a dark mahogany color with no head or lacing at all.  Aroma of roast, chocolate, nuts, light vanilla oak, and also fruity.  Taste was tart grapes and cherries, more vanilla oak, and light roast as well.  I enjoyed this more than the regular Adam.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
2661,"2004-08-27",3.5,"Body is dark brown. Aroma is moderately malty (burnt caramel, molasses), with notes of sherry, whisky, wood, alcohol. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, syrupy texture, soft carbonation, moderately alcoholic. As Im not as big a fan as most of fresh Adam, it makes sense Im also under the average for this aged version. I think Alan said this was about 8 years old now, and the oxidation is pretty obvious as a result. Oddly, the bourbon effect was not terribly corny like it can often be...perhaps thanks to the long aging time.  Like Dave, fun to try, but not a huge fan.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
