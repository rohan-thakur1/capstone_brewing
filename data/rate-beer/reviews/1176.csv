1176,"2017-06-16",4.3,"DATE: June 16, 2017... OCCASION: the boys are out of school... time for a beer that suggests sunshine and summer... GLASSWARE: Victory Hop Devil nonick... lively light amber body that densely shields any vision through the glass... the white head laces beautifully above the beer line... mango, tangerine, and other tropical fruits combine with lemon and hay to draft a suggestion of an island summer... dangerously medium-bodied, subtle like low-eighties heat, and highly drinkable, belying its 8% ABV... a creamy body dissolves at the finish, with teeth tickled and slight bitterness rolling in... the feeling lingers, but as the label suggests, the lupulin eases you towards the next sip... the flavor profile is decidedly fruity, with passion fruit, mango, and grapefruit ripely on the tongue... slight balance is provided by malts that do not inhibit the experience... big shout-out to Jeff for delivering this one as part of a four-pack treasure trove... having heard a lot of Lawsons, I can now say the introductions pleasure was all mine.,,","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"

Flavor: all the above, just ramped up, plus mango, passion fruit.. Mouthfeel: medium- to full-bodied; lush, soft on palette; lingering sticky hop resins coating tongue and roof of mouth. Similar to Heady Topper, just more drinkable; not as astringent, especially as it warms.","Plattsburgh, New York, USA","shawnmurphy"
1176,"2017-06-11",4.1,"Takeaway: it tastes more like a West Coast IPA than one from VT/New England. If youre going to drink a few others with this one, save it for the end or every beer you have after will taste like a Sip of Sunshine.

Other impressions: 
-I typically pour it into an IPA glass, but its really good out of the can too. 
-If poured, the milky white head stays put for most of the beer. 
-It comes out an amber/gold with little to no haze.
-Tropical fruit aromas stay put the entire time.","Connecticut, USA","shobramberg"

1176,"2017-03-19",4.3,"Got in a BIF from Roguer. 16 ounce can into tulip glass, canned on 2/7/2017. Pours slightly hazy medium golden yellow color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense foamy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big tangerine, grapefruit, peach, passion fruit, papaya, pineapple, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange zest, light pepper/pine, honey, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, peach, passion fruit, papaya, pineapple, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange zest, light pepper/pine, honey, lightly toasted biscuit, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/citrus peel/grassy/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, peach, passion fruit, papaya, pineapple, mango, melon, guava, berry, lemon/orange peel, pepper, pine, honey, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with fantastic malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from lingering bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, creamy/bready/grainy/sticky, and lightly resinous balanced mouthfeel that is great. Touch of rind near the end of the glass. Alcohol is well hidden with a mild warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible DIPA. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink with the balanced bitterness. Super dank/juicy hops with balanced malt sweetness; with just enough dryness to not be overly sweet or astringent on hops. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
1176,"2017-02-23",4.3,"Heard a lot about this one before trying it so was excited to see singles on sale at a local liquor store even though they were way overpriced. Anyway, the actual beer itself is pretty great though not quite a mind blower like you may be lead to believe. The aroma is very nice, strong and seductive with delicious hoppy zest. It pours a slinky gold cloud. Tastewise, its got some pretty round lupilicious hop action going on that just slithers its way into your tum tum. This is a very good beer, one of the best really, but in a battle of VTs biggest and baddest, I gotta go strong on the side of Headdy Topper/Focal Banger in the great VT IPA head to head.

Was lucky enough to get 10 pretty sweet beers sent to me by a college buddy. Decided to start with Lawsons Lip of Sunshine, which I sampled on July 27, 2016 at the second annual MW bottleshare. Only gave it a 4 at the time but I was the last to have it and only had the ending. Hoping for it to live up to its reputation with a full review here.

Poured a straw-gold yellow semi-hazy color with 3-to-4 fingers of rocky white head. Bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Outstanding spotty lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.25)

Smelled a potent mix of tropical and citrus fruit up front, getting juicy red grapefruit, tropical punch, passion fruit, mango, orange, pineapple, floral and some herbal. Definitely Citra in the hops, but not sure what else. Just fantastic on the nose. (Smell - 4.75)

Man, the taste was just as good. Got Citra, red grapefruit, fruit punch, passion fruit, very sugary, mango, blood orange, pineapple, floral and bitter tropical rind. (Taste - 4.50)

Light body. Oily-to-creamy texture. Average carbonation. Abrupt, citrusy, boozy finish. (Feel - 4.00)

This was fantastic. Much better than that warm sample in July. Pretty boozy and sugary though, not sure Id want a 4-pack (yes I would). (Overall - 4.50)

Thick sweet maracuya, canned pineapple and lime jam pierced by obvious abv fusels and dank pelletised hop particles in aroma - exotic citrics broken down into that dried peach & lemon ice tea granulate. This might be an effect of this can being close to 3months old...that fermenting pineapple sweetness. - Great balance of honey malt sweetness, yeasty haze and massive citrus-resinous marmelade in flavour, on a thick syrupy mouthfeel on the sweet nectar side of IPAs. Obvious abv fusels permeate the thick sweet lemon rind hop soup almost as in a tripel, only to strangely subside and retract into the jammy body as it warms up...Lingering floral-bitter and hop-citric sweet finish, retronasal those pellet hops again.

1176,"2016-09-18",4.2,"Thanks, Adam, for hooking this up. This beer has made me fall for IPAs all over again. Appearance: slightly opaque amber-orange with quarter inch foamy ivory head. Aroma: orange zest, sugared orange slices. Reminiscent of PTE. Taste: pulpy fresh squeezed OJ almost all the way through. Some coriander-like bitterness at the end. A little bit of alcohol heat, but not much. Drinks softer than most 8% beers. Lingering notes of sugared citrus and vanilla. Palate: creamy mouthfeel with balanced but popping carbonation. This is a solid contender for top IPA. Its right up there with the TG IPAs, and superior to anything Alpine is doing.","Alabama, USA","Dr_MedievAle"

This is nice, fairly assertive hops and a touch of caramel malt, good herbal and juicy flavors. Not in the style of the ""hazy hoppy beer"" or whatever theyre called now.

Very tasty. Not the most extraordinary, but perfectly balanced, quite light bodied for a DIPA, with juicy fruit notes and a great dry finish, so that it drinks quite easy for the ABV. Not among my very favourite style examples, but a world class DIPA I would always gladly drink again.","Vienna Woods, AUSTRIA","Saeglopur"

There is a strong wet maltiness and wet plant tendency. It's got less funk than there was in the aroma but the dank maltiness is a little less than ideal. Less tropical fruit in the flavor, but it is pretty balanced. The mouth feel is surprisingly thick and nicely carbonated. The aftertaste is tropical fruits and a blast of malts.

Peach, pineapple, mango, candied citrus with a little grass and pine in an otherwise mildly bitter finish. Full bodied.

Accidentally had this in a pint glass last week thinking it was an AIPA, but only found out today its a DIPA. This is based off of my third can to tulip. The appearance had a hazy glossy orange color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds leaving some light speckled to semi-spider web lacing.
The smell had a full bittersweet citrus hops with a light underscore of piney hops, graced by a big sweet sticky freshly cut grass and as it opens up, the citrus opens up to lean towards the grapefruit.
The taste balanced extremely nicely between the bitter citrus and piney hops to the sweet freshly cut grass. Sticky sweet grapefruit to grassy aftertaste leads to a wet citrus finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a great sessionability about it. Id want to pound this on a hot Summers day. 8%, oh hell no but then again, I realize judging from the date, it also could have lost its touch a bit.

1176,"2015-01-13",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2015 My Bottom Line:
Citrus fruit and resins magically grow through honeyed cereals, dallying back and forth in the smoothest and most comfortable of mouthfeels.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sumptuous head of foam settles atop the shiny amber honey.
-Carbonation is soft and ample, a marvelous contributor to an easygoing mouthfeel.
-Honeyed residual sugars are as slick and elegant as can be.
-Bitterness is not overdone, simply balancing out the finish while offering what one expects from a Double IPA.
-At 8%, this is dangerously drinkable/.
-Little detail, but the yeast flocculates very nicely in the can, making sure there is no obstruction in the first pour. Its all hop and malt glory.
-By memory, this is smoother than Double Sunshine and more citrusy/less bitter.
-This is better than Heady Topper in all aspects (ducking for cover).
-This is also a surprisingly close cousin to Sculpin (save perhaps for the bittering hops and their intensity).

Bitterness is secondary to the other flavors and aromas of the hops that they use. I would almost put this ahead of Heady Topper as the best IPA in the world just because of the flavor. While Heady does an amazing job of putting together a strong, intensely bitter yet still drinkable IPA, Sip of Sunshine is just the most tasty IPA you will ever find. Heady is for special occasions, but this one is perfect for any occasion.","Newington, Connecticut, USA","fishonmyplane"

It appears to be a straw/golden semi-transparent beer with a decent well sustained head. Aroma is very citrus forward with a small malt scent to it. The taste starts with Citrus closely following what would be predicted by the aroma. The taste is not as hoppy as I might have thought. Not as full of a malt backbone compared to heady topper for Pliney the elder. But then that is very stiff competition. A moderately Hoppe finish. A decent beer but if you were in Vermont get heady topper or go to Hill Farmstead and try Susan if it happens to be on tap (which it happens to be right now, fuck yeah!!!)

Pours a sunny, glowing, yellow color, with a huge froth head.

Has aromas of, grass, pine, as well as tropical, slightly unripe grapefruit with a lemon bite to it. Bready, malty qualities become recognizable beneath the hoppiness, leaving the focus on the fruit, while adding a subtle honeyed hint.

The hoppiness straight from the very beginning is remarkable, defined by grass and lemon rind, which settles above dough, bready malts, as well as an increasing fruitiness, which blends amazingly well into the grassy, floral flavors. The fruits, grapefruit, blood orange and kiwi get accompanied by big chunks of lime, settling among a bubbly, fitting carbonation. The sunny aspect gets provided by a glimpse of glazed, honeyed malts, which covers the tingling fruit acid beautifully. It not only gives the beer its balance but adds depths to the fruit appearance, supporting the versatile, bitter hops. While beginning crisp, floral, with unripe, dry fruits, the hops develop into a more tropical, resinous direction, completed by a honeyed, malty peak. Finishes with a slick dryness, developing from a rich, exuberant, smooth fruitiness. The sourness dries-out the tongue, while at the same time a honeyed fruitiness wraps up the palate.","GERMANY","aleigator"
1176,"2014-12-30",5.0,"Had this on tap at Eli Cannons in Middletown, CT last night -- this beer has been talked up quite a bit. 

The nose is incredibly permeating, super floral, pine, grapefruit, mandarin orange - you can pickup its delightful smell from a meter away. Or perhaps its because everyone in the bar was drinking it. 

Bring it up close and its like wafting a handful of whole hops just moments after picking. Completely surreal how Lawsons captured this.

It pours a golden brown color, tight carbonation, tasted in a 12oz snifter glass.

I picked up four stages of taste sensations, which Ive never experienced before with an IPA. Its like each level of the brewing process is present in the taste from bittering to hop back. You have to taste it to believe it. Just when you think youve moved through the spectrum of flavor more creeps in. You wont want it to end.

Overall, this is the best IPA Ive ever enjoyed in my 10 years of tasting artisanal beer. Chalk it up to the moment, the holiday spirit, but more than anything else, an incredibly original offering by Lawsons Finest.","MEXICO","billcarleton"

Appearance: Dark golden hue over a very hazy body. Pours to a large, white, foamy head which laces and retains well.

Smell: Pungent aroma of tropical fruit juices, citrus, and an herbal scent.

Taste: Its been a while since Ive had a beer from Lawsons Finest Liquids, though I definitely remember the New England-style IPA character that comes with their IPAs. Sip of Sunshine definitely revived my memory as soon as it hit my lips. A strong taste of hop flavor and strong bitterness with accompanying herbal spiciness. 

The malt base is strong, but simple. Kind of a standard amber/caramel/honey malt character thats not especially sweet or distinctive. The hops are the star of the show, of course. Im guessing Mosaic hops are used here as theres both a tropical/ stone fruit flavor as well as slight garlic/onion sensation on the back end. The palette is a bit repetitive, which is fine since its so enjoyable. This what I expect in a DIPA, and this brew definitely satisfies.

Drinkability: For a big, 8% ABV beer, Sip of Sunshine IPA is actually remarkably drinkable. The mouthfeel is soft, calm, and comfortable with a finish to match. Virtually no alcohol presence, despite the strong body. Theres no dry or cloying aftertaste, its actually quite clean (but I would not consider it refreshing).","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Sweet, stingy citrus juice and dank, field after the rain notes coexist peacefully as in the best examples of the fruit and flower forward new IPA. The flavor is excellently balanced and brilliantly bright, but theres a shade of grain alcohol coloring the back end and lingering into the finish.

Aroma is quite piney with a nice citrus burst just after, onion notes and light sweetness. Taste is dominated by juicy hops (citrus burst again) with a good resinous presence, a good malt backbone but only a moderate sweetness, light spiciness, hints of alcohol (but still not much for an 8% abv beer) and moderate bitterness. Medium body. Medium/lively carbonation. Slightly oily mouthfeel. Bone dry finish. Light warming presence. Another very good DIPA from Lawsons Finest. Super drinkable and quenching for an 8% abv beer. The alcohol is a little more present than in there Double Sunshine even though its the same abv. Excellent balance. These guys know how to make hoppy beers.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

1176,"2014-06-15",3.9,"Wonderful DIPA. Light copper pour with lively carbonation. Aroma was wonderful mix of citrus salad (orange, mango, lemon, grapefruit) and some hop spice. Taste followed, was slightly more floral and had a bitterness at the end. Perfect carbonation that wasn't too heavy for a big ipa.","Georgia, USA","rdixon77"

Aroma of fresh hops, Juicy Fruit gum, sweet fruity candy and freshly squeezed tangerine/grapefruit. Taste is much the same as the aroma.

Aroma of citrusy and lightly resinous and floral hops, pale and caramel malts, and light dough. Flavor the same with a bitter finish. Average texture. A decent double IPA but could be more balanced.  Edit: Had from a bottle and liked it a little more.  Cant wait to see what the cans are like.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
1176,"2014-06-05",4.0,"(En fût @ Tap & Grill Burlington) - Bière orangée voilée à leffervescence peu frénétique. Le nez déborde de houblons fruités; on jubile. En bouche, on mord dans de belles grosses tranches de pamplemousse rose, amères et juteuses. À ce titre, lamertume demeure active pendant de longues et savoureuses secondes en arrière-goût. Un beau ptit trésor de terrasse qui trouverait aussi sa place pour égayer une soirée dhiver.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","BiereLuc"

Biiiig dank citrus and tropical fruit nose, lots of ripe orange, mango, papaya, tangerine. Big sweet flavor with low bitterness but lots of juicy, fruity hops, some honeydew, pale bready sugars, tangerine, canteloupe, mango. Medium to full bodied with fine carbonation and oily texture. Sweet, sticky and resinous on the finish, plenty more juicy tropical fruits, ripe citrus. A heavy-duty DIPA but still very drinkable.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

The taste is intense citrus, grapefruit with some honey sweetness in the middle before ending dry and crisply bitter. Light/medium body with fine above average carbonation. Wonderful stuff!!","Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, ENGLAND","ThirstyBird"
1176,"2014-04-22",4.5,"Draft at the Big Picture Show in Waitsfield. Pours a lovely deep copper with an off-white head that lingers. Aroma is a pungent, mixed spicy hops flora. Flavor rich with citrus high notes, but backed up with a solid caramel on the bottom - but not enough to be sticky. Medium body with soft carbonation. Lovely long, twisting aftertaste that finishes softly and leaves you begging for another sip.

This is a gutsy IIPA that takes no prisoners. Its probably the best beer Ive had out of the Two Roads Brewery. Different, and bigger, that its name-alike Double Sunshine which seems a little shy by comparison. No compromise here Im happy to say.","Rowayton, Connecticut, USA","philipmeese"

Nose is booze, biscuit and lemon jam with an orange acid explosion. Great mix of my two favorite beers, spring Fever & Double sunshine in my opinion.

1176,"2014-04-14",4.0,"Pours a clear golden orange, medium off white head. Aroma is dank hops, orange rind, sweet fruits, pine. Taste is fruity, floral, spicy pine hop, finish is bitter and a bit boozy (more so than double sunshine). Medium body, average carbonation. Really solid, but drank this right before double sunshine and it was no contest.","New York, USA","drsandman"
1176,"2014-04-05",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2015 on tap at blackback with Simon and Cory. Pours hazy and shimmering orange gold. Sick lacing. Aromas are bitter oranges, grapefruit rind. Its bitter but nowhere near aggressive. Flavor coats the tongue with orange and mango dankness. Not too sweet or boozy. Exceptionally well executed and much better than the last 4-5 batches of double sunshine I have tried. Tried again a couple months later on a new batch...nice but a little sweet and alcoholic. Very bitter...moved down a couple notches. Tried again many times, its booze and gross sugar. Not a fan of this beer at all anymore. We need some double sunshine like the old days.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
