2295,"2016-11-15",3.7,"500 ml bottle. 2015 vintage. Thanks Timo A!
Murky brown color with a tiny tan head.
Spices, dark fruits, sweetness, gingerbread, figs and sweet sugary malt. 
The flavor is yeast, sweet malt, sugar, syrup, red wine and dark fruits. The aroma is barley winey but the flavor is clearly Belgian style.

2295,"2016-11-15",3.9,"50 cl bottle (2015 vintage).
Pours hazy amber color with a small head. Aroma is quite strong ripe fruits, some mead-like honey notes, dark berries, alcohol peaks through a bit, spices. Flavor is dark malts, ripe fruits, caramel, raisins, yeasty, spicy, honey and some apricot, vinous dry finish. Alcohol comes through a bit but still quite nice strong ale. Balances between Quad and Barley Wine.

2295,"2016-08-02",4.2,"Craig on BarTowel made me open the Lambda. Probably 2013 or 2014 bottle, so maybe two and a half years old?

Wow opens a little gushy, what just happened! But tastes very good - layers of really good tasty dense dark dried fruit, overlaying hints of apricot tartness and dry. Molasses cake. Sticky but not in a simple sugary way, reminds me of good port or something like that. Hints of hay and barnyard. Pretty fine stuff actually, and nothing like any Bellwoods beer Ive tried before stylistically. Belgian Quad? Maybe more of an Abt, the sister style that tends darker. This is a flavorful tonsil blanket of love. My gosh this is good, so big and yet balanced. Fine instead of forceful, yet loads of flavor, like a good Burgundy.

If I had another bottle Id open it super chilled from the fridge or a snowbank, and set the bottle in a pot in the sink for any outflow. Its too good to waste. Man that lingering apricot or something on the finish is so nice!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DerWeg"

2295,"2016-06-13",3.6,"Bottle (500 ml). Gusher. Split 2-ways with Simon B. Hazy reddish-brown with a small beige head leaving little lacing. Aroma is of fruity brettanomyces, Belgian yeast, mild spiciness, alcohol, caramel notes, mild to moderate spiciness and dates. Taste is slightly sweet (not much residual sweetness for the style, the brett were hungry I guess) with caramel, fruity brettanomyces, nutty notes, alcohol, mild to moderate spiciness, Belgian yeast and chocolate. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Fruity finish with mild chocolatey aftertaste. Good fruity brett quad with a fun chocolatey presence. The less fun side is that the depth is not impressive which probably is an effect of the brettanomyces here. Good.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Alcohol is warming, but the tart acidity from the brett cuts through almost all the booziness one would expect from 12% content. Brett notes also help to balance out the sweetness and make this crazy drinkable. Favorite beer from Bellwoods by a large margin.

Un nez puissant où fruits confits, pruneaux et caramel salé se confrontent nez à nez avec du soja. En bouche le liquide mest difficile à boire tant celui-ci est sucré. Cette caractéristique nen fait pas une mauvaise bière, mais pour moi qui aime peu le sucre, je peine à terminer mon verre. Le caramel salé revient avec force, accompagné dun sucre dorge et de mélasse. Lalcool est bien discret tant le reste est tonitruant.

2295,"2014-05-11",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Dried cranberries, sour cherries and raisins proliferate on top of peppery spiciness, chocolate and earthy bitterness for a most complex dessert of a Wild Quadrupel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam crowns the mahogany-hued brown.
-A first approach made me imagine an Imperial Flanders Red, or something of the sort. The nose is definitely ""brettier"" and more wooden than the flavor profile.
-The mouthfeel is sweeter than expected. But it still makes for a wonderful dessert beer.
-Carbonation is prickly yet soft, alleviating most of the sweetness.
-Aftertaste is rather grape-like, fruity.
-Alcohol warmth is polite, despite the 11%. It also accompanies the light acidity in the finish in cutting through the sugars.

Lightly hazy dark brown body with a nice frothy tan head. 3+ Aroma of fruity highlights over sweet dark malt 7++ Flavour is lovely, sweet rich malty core, fruity character, sort of vinous undertones and a whisper of very lightly astringent wood like notes, quite fruity throughout. 8++ Very smooth medium bodied palate, very soft carbonation. 4+ Very nice stuff. 7/4/9/4/16 Session 3, Cask Days 2013, Toronto

2013-08-30. Much fruitier and more vinous than I recall from Saturday but otherwise pretty much the same. Smooth medium body. Touch more alcohol presence than before. Warming in the throat.  Lovely. On tap at Volo, Toronto

2013-08-24. Very dark brown nice beige head. 4+ Aroma of rich sweet malt with moderate barrel overtones and a very light vinous character. Subtle fruity notes grow as it gets warmer. 7+ Flavour is just lovely. Rich sweet malt core, sugary caramel notes, delicate fruit undertones and mild vinous character throughout. Rich smooth full bodied palate soft carbonation. Not super complex, some might consider it too sweet but holy crap do the flavours work well together. Curious to see if aging this with brett (?) as I believe is the the plan will entice me even more or diminish the impact of the rich sweetness. We shall see! Sweet superlatives this is good! My favorite of the day. 8/5/10/4/19  On tap at Volo Bellwoods Sunsplash event, Toronto","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
2295,"2013-10-22",4.0,"This is amazing. The brettamonyces is there, the barrel is there, quad elements are there and its all perfectly balanced. Pours cloudy brown with some mocha bubbles. You can taste the wood in the barrel, but only subtly. Some raisins, some well-integrated light candy cane. Everything extremely well-integrated and amazing. Sweet with just the right sourness to balance it out. Cask Days 2013.Earlier Rating: 8/31/2013 Total Score: 4.2Ranks among the best Bellwoods. Makes me more excited to open my bottle of Motley Cru. Barrel evident but meshes well with quadrupel elements. Aroma of wine, prune, raisins and some dark malt. Pours dark reddish brown with great head and lacing. Finishes with medium sweetness. Soft carbonation. Wonderful. Tap at volos.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"

In mouth, superb oily sweet cooked caramel and apple sauce with light soy sauce, Brett, vanilla beans, and cork notes, silky and nice. Cask Days 2013.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"

2295,"2013-08-25",3.9,"Bottle, enjoyed at Barvolo during Bellwoods tap takeover event. Dark brown with orange highlights. Surprisingly funky nose, Bretty sour notes mingle with woody caramel. Loads of residual sugars lend a base sweetness to chocolate and caramel malts, but its the Brett character that really makes this brew sing! Notes of yoghurt and sour cherries. No trace of the 11%. Nice of the brewer to pull a bunch of this brew off early to bring as a surprise to the Sunsplash event! Would love to taste this after 7 more months in the barrel!","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
