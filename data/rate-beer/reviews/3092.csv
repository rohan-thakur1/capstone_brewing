3092,"2017-03-08",4.0,"750ml shared by Brad. Not really a Porter, at least a lot lighter in color. Great juicy pepper tones. Great smoke notes. Heavy specialty malt tones. Heavy sticky finish. Nice depth, very enjoyable.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
3092,"2016-07-01",3.5,"Muddy river water color with a single finger tan head. Aroma is smokey and slightly sweet. A hint of green pepper as well. Lace present. Medium bodied. A little burn in the back of your throat from the peppers as you enjoy this. Taste is full of smoke and some pepper. Dry finish. Nice take on a smoked beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","dinkle50"
3092,"2016-04-05",3.8,"Bomber from chucky and shared with the fellas...nose was all peppers....mouth was really nice with lots of smokey flavors...not as much pepper in the mouth...solid brew...(#804)","Minnesota, USA","johnnymusky"
3092,"2015-12-01",3.9,"What a beer! Pours a brown red color with a medium white head. The aroma is all big massive peppers. The flavor genuinely tastes like smoked peppers, not hot, big smoky malts. Some chocolate and toast. Awesome. A bottle would be too much alone.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
3092,"2015-11-29",3.7,"Bottle. Colour...dark brown with a thin tan head. Nose...smoky, peppery; imagine that! Palate...huge, peppery and long with smoky goodness and more pepper than you can shake a poblano at! Theres not really any heat here, just loads of smoky, peppery flavours.","Portland, Oregon, USA","neepsntatties"

A small sample pour of this was all I required to determine it would be a love / hate response. For me the outcome tends to be enjoyable although only in small doses. Much more than three to four ounces would burn out my taste buds for the next 12 hours. That said it carves out a niche that merits trying at least once.

Aroma / Appearance - A bronze reddish base radiates warmth as if the peppers were trying to heat you up just with the visual presence. Smoky peppers and spices waste no time in making a statement. Teetering right on the edge of overwhelming this profile attempts to be about as subtle as a freight train passing through a residential neighborhood.

Flavor / Palate - Spicy pepper flakes heat the mouth. As the burning sensation builds it adds a malty undertone which almost takes off the edge. Around the four ounce mark I was ready to declare myself done. Fortunately by then the glass was empty; Im not sure how I could have handled an entire pint or a bomber solo. If you like spicy things then get some to try yourself.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
3092,"2015-05-26",4.3,"Was worried about this but once I smelled the aromas I was hooked. Hickory and maple smoke without usual metallic smoke character of some smoked beers. Flavors of balanced coffee peppers and smokiness. Medium mouthfeel and flavorful finish.","San Luis Rey, California, USA","Beersmithbacon"
3092,"2015-04-18",3.8,"Bottle from a locals for locals trade Atom. Pours dark reddish brown color with tan head. Aromas of smoked malts and peppers. Smoked meat flavor with some smoked peppers and earthiness. Just a hint of heat on the back end, nice and not overwhelming like many pepper beers. Medium body with average carbonation. Quite enjoyable. Thanks Adam.","Winter Springs, Florida, USA","smith4498"
3092,"2015-03-10",3.8,"Draft on tap at the brewery (Minneapolis, MN). Pours a deeper rich blackish hue, opaque body with a touch of plum midnight color on the edges and bottom. Frothy tannish head dies to a nice filmy layer, decent retention and lacing. Aromas are a bit toasty and carmelized, mellow toast and coffee meet subtle roast, earth, black malts and a bit of smoke, earth and subtle soil. Earth, chile and chipotle smoke and heat. Nice dark fruit, smokey earth and pepper. A bit of toast, earth and black malts. Some touches of chocolate, earth, subtle ash. The peppery life integrates well with earth, smoke, a faint cinnamon and biscuity life. Backend isnt hop, the pepper additions are smokey and earthy, dark fruit and depth give this some real good flavor and depth without being thick, brooding or overwhelming. Finish is a bit toasty, smokey, with lingering peppers and earth. Carmelized, softened cocoa and a bit of creaminess at times. Gentle heat but nothing all that present instead focusing on the smoke and earth. Fun stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3092,"2015-02-28",3.9,"Brown body with active legs and a long retaining off white head. Aroma of peppers, smoke. Fairly simple beer here with smoke being the main player, pepper heat coming in second, and some vanilla and caramel base. Not super complex, but I do like the flavor profile.

>> Clear deep red pour, okay foam. Spicy salsa nose, red jalapeño. Taste is papery, watery, weak, spicy red jalapeño. Dusty, not really imperial porter palate or roast wise. Would need a lot more body to balance out the heat.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3092,"2015-01-23",3.4,"On tap at Northbound. Pours a clear deep amber an earthy brown head that dissipates to the edges.

3092,"2014-12-07",3.5,"750 mL bottle supplied from Stine in Minnesota - many thanks! 9% abv, on bottom-left side of bottle. To oversized snifter, it pours a (wtf!) ginger ale-tinted medium brown with which an off-white head ringed head 1 finger in length stood. Aromas of white vinegar, rain-soaked Camel cigarettes, caramel apples, camefire smoke, iceberg lettuce, wheat dough, chocolate malt, paprika, basil, and German yeast. It probably shouldnt smell as though it were a slice of craft pizza and all its crazy toppings - or at least Im guessing. Thats neither good nor bad. Tastes the same with the addition of peated malt, light-roast coffee beans, and spent grain. Only by swallow does an attractively contained peppery spiciness come through, which I very much like. Here are just the facts, though: This is an imperial porter base, and I like my IPs chewy and dark, and this is 1. Watery as hell, and 2. Looks like a blend of Dr. Pepper and a ginger ale. So, yeah, interesting, but truly wasnt my cup of tea.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
3092,"2014-12-04",4.1,"750ml bottle thanks thome50. Pours a medium brown with a small tan head. Aromas of smoked chili peppers and roasted malts. Taste is spicy as all get out, and semi dry. Really over the top pepper heat, along with a touch of smoke. The end result is very good, though. High boost imperial ported accented with hot peppers and smoke. I dig this beer a lot.","Victor, New York, USA","MacBoost"
3092,"2014-08-31",3.7,"A real nice cool heat on the aroma and taste. The smoked peppers play a real nice role and keep a great subtle spicy palate. Definitely best with grilled food as a lot of this would be tough to drink on its own.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","falco242"
3092,"2014-08-15",3.6,"Ruby brown pour.
Aroma is smoke, green pepper. Roasted malt.
Flavour is dark fruit, smoke, hickory, green pepper, spice catches in the back of the throat. Interesting and enjoyable beer.

3092,"2014-06-22",5.0,"This is truly an amazing and delicious beer! The pepper flavor is amazing with just the right amount of heat. The pepper in combination with the Imperial Smoked Porter makes this beer extremely unique with tons of character and flavor. Rich and dark with a thick foamy head.

3092,"2014-06-18",3.7,"Woodshed 3.0, Hot Box? Hot Damn! Sample courtesy of Sparky. 750mL pours with a mahogany colored body that supports a dirty tan head of foam. The aroma offers up big and bruising chili pepper heavy salsa, mild molasses notes, malt sweetened dark roasted malts and a light smokiness. The flavor delivers a good dose of smoke and then a thin ring of molasses. Very quickly though big chili pepper meat bubbles up along with a slowly growing peppery burn. This has a thin body and a mild malty backbone that allows the solid pepper to shine but not to the point of going over the top.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
3092,"2014-06-08",3.7,"Bottle shared @ Woodshed 3.0 by the ever generous Sparky! Really interesting brew that certainly has a lot going on. Aroma is a bit aggressive with loads of fiery chili pepper heat, cocoa, smoke, and wood. Had to move my nose from the bottle because of the capsaicin. Flavor isnt nearly as assertive but still shows chipotle, chocolate, and charred wood. Not a bad beer!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"

3092,"2014-03-02",3.9,"10 oz. pour, on tap at the Indeeds taproom during a Minneapolis taproom crawl (Harriet to Indeed to Dangerous Man) on 3-1-14. Pours dark brown with a small to moderate amount of taupe head. Good-looking. Strong and appealing smell is spicy and peppery and features the roasted malts. Smoky, peppery, umami taste features a Bacos-like flavor. Really good taste. I definitely experience a pepper bite. Quite spicy and hot but not excessively so. Full body. Lively in the palate. Very tasty and enjoyable. This was my favorite beer of the taproom crawl. Indeed seems to be getting most of the credit for this beer, and it is a balanced and strong beer across the board, but its the Northbound pepper-smoking that makes this beer special.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
