4530,"2011-08-22",3.8,"A - Served a hazy golden-yellow color with a finger of frothy white head atop and lots of visible carbonation. The head faded down slowly leaving behind some nice lacing in the process.

S - Aroma was a mix of yeast with some banana character, some grains, and some lemon. There was also some light hops and spices in the background.

T - Starts off with some good yeast flavor and some slightly tart lemon. Through the middle, the tartness fades and some grain flavor replaces it with some hops and light spices coming through. The finish is a mix of yeast and grain flavors that linger nicely.

M - Medium-light bodied with moderate-plus lively carbonation. Feels super smooth and crisp without being watery or thin.

D - Very drinkable. The flavors blend really nicely here and are a bit stronger than many pilsners. However, the beer still retains the great tradition mouthfeel and crispness of a good pilsner.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"
4530,"2011-08-17",3.8,"Russian river pils. Growler much thanks to ken for sending this...  
Golden hazy golden hue with a creamy white head... Aroma of bready soft grain and a light lemony citrus hop component...

A: Pours a dark straw color with a nice white head and good lacing as it goes down. Plenty of carbonation bubbles visible through the transparent brew.

S: Lots of Noble hops accompany a solid pilsner malt base.

T: The hops dominate atop a slightly-sweet and grainy malt base.

M: A little heavier than most pilsners, while still maintaining a nice, smooth mouthfeel with the right amount of carbonation.

D: Quite drinkable and very sessionable. This one and the Aud Blonde were nice surprises at RR--some very solid sessionable beers from what a great brewery.

4530,"2009-08-03",3.9,"On tap at the brewpub.  Mostly hazy, pale straw colored body with a finger of fizzy white head.  Moderate herbal/spicy noble hop aroma with a faint, crackery pils malt note in the background.  Clean and fresh aroma.  Not as inviting of a pils malt aroma as Id like, but the juiciness of the hop aroma is certainly welcome.  Light bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel with a soft, silky texture.  Light crackery malt presence up front, followed quickly by a powerful herbal hop flavor.  Intensely hoppy, with an herbal/spicy character that almost approaches grapefruit in quality, but still maintains a ""noble"" hop perception.  Finishes dry, with a refreshing hop bitterness lingering on the palate.  This is an awesome, summertime refreshing pilsner example with a hop flavor that provides stiff competition for prima pils.  The board stated 33IBUs, but my perception would be more in the 45-50 range.  A little bit more pils malt complexity would be nice, but the mouthfeel is right on and I wouldnt want that to get in the way of the hop character.  Overall, a very enjoyable beer.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Flavor is more of the same, with the hops very fresh-tasting and prominent.  Almost like a pilsner IPA.
