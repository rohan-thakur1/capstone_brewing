1448,"2016-09-02",2.2,"[2015 Backlog] Bottle shared at Pauls. Pours a hazy amber body with soft white head. Nose is malt, weird stale veggie leaf and spice.

1448,"2015-04-16",2.7,"Location: Bottle shared at Max and Andys Tasting, 2/28/15


Aroma: Has a light vegetal nose, malty hints, not much else

Appearance: Hazy amber color with an average sized off-white head

Flavor: Fairly light flavor, okay, thin, and a little dull

Palate: The body is light-medium, average carbonation, okay overall feel

Overall Impression: 
Theres not a ton going on here, kind of a dull beer, what is going on is kind of vegetal, and not in a not great way. Eh...","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
1448,"2015-04-02",1.7,"16oz pint at this Biergarten places in Charleston. Pours a lightly hazy orange with some white head. Thats about where things go wrong... nose is rough, harsh hop, soggy malts, yeast, celery, ranch dressing. Flavor follows, lots of celery, white pepper and coriander, soggy moldy bread. Harsh finish. This one beer nearly ruined my night.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"

1448,"2013-07-21",3.6,"Bottle

Appearance: Beautiful clear orange amber with short lasting white head

Aroma: Green apples, bread

Taste: Fruity and floral undertones. Finish with a bready bitterness

Palate: Light body. Flat with spicy undertones.

Overall: Very drinkable, although the bitter finish sticks with you long after the drink. Interesting, subtle fruit undertones makes this more complex than the body might make you believe.","Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, USA","icehawk"

1448,"2009-08-13",3.8,"From a growler fill at Charleston Beer Exchange. A healthy off white head builds from a deep, clear, amber pour, but it settles somewhat quickly. A caramel aroma comes on first, followed by a faint fruitiness and some spicy hops. Smooth, medium body, velvety mouthfeel, and light carbonation all complement each other. The malty sweetness up front certainly dominates, but a good dose of spicy bitterness compensates to leave the finish softly dry. Very drinkable, smooth and enjoyable.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"
1448,"2009-07-18",4.0,"Amber pour, nice fluffy head, growler is 20 minutes old.  Super sexy nose of toasted malt, with a touch of toffee and floral hop.  A soft entry builds as the malt layers unfold.  I get a definite warming malt note of toasted pecan that I cannot get enough of.  The hops stay noble and add just the right touch of classical restraint.  Obnoxiously drinkable for 6.3%.  Beer with soul.","Charleston, USA","Bigsilky"
1448,"2008-09-23",3.8,"Sampled at Brewgrass 2008.  Good looking clear amber/copper pour with frothy head.  A touch of grain to the aroma with a nicely crisp earthy/grassy hop presence.  I though this was very drinkable and sessionable.  Some light fruity semi-sweet malt grain leads to a caramel finish with some balanced hop presence (citrus..tough to tell).  Smooth medium body.  Good Alt!","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"
1448,"2008-09-21",3.5,"Tap at Brewgrass.  Nice hazy golden pour with a huge white head.  I didn’t find it ""aggressively hoppy"" as the description notes.  It was sweet and well-balanced with German malt and nice light hops; a bit spicey and earthy.  I feel like there were grassy/lemon notes.  Wish I had more of this.  Good luck to this new brewery!","Durham, North Carolina, USA","durhambeer"
1448,"2008-08-20",3.9,"The aroma was nutty and malty with a strong caramel component and a Munich malt presence coupled to a lightly earthy hop spice. The beer arrived on the bar crystal clear amber golden with a low white long lasting head which lasted well enough to lace the glass. The flavor was initially slightly sweet with a nutty Munich malt character. The flavor was crisp with a somewhat estery character and a earthy hop note which was lightly spicy. The finish became eventually dry with a lasting malt impression long into the aftertaste and beyond. The body was just above medium with a moderate carbonation and a lightly creamy texture on the palate. The beer had a great hop aftertaste.
