3506,"2016-10-06",3.7,"Cask at Elliott Bay, listed as ""Dark and Mild"".

Damn I wish this style would take off in the US. Darker in color than I expected with more roast coffee in the aroma. (From the mouthfeel Im reminded how much I love cask ales.) Gently sweet, driving by the roasted malt, mellow noble hops. Whats really great about this though is that at 3.7% its nothing like the 3.7% pisswater that you get by default in Utah. Its full-flavored and on cask the mouthfeel is great and the whole thing is enjoyable. It was nice to drink two pints and only be as far in as if Id had one strong IPA.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
3506,"2016-08-29",3.9,"Bottle labeled ""Dark Mild"" - a milky, sweet and mildly smokey nose. Definitely features a heavy roast. In the mouth its light and nutty with a good dash of acrid ashiness. The bottle conditioning does great work. A really great beer, Id love to sit out on the grass at an English beer festival and drink this one.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Alphadelic"
3506,"2016-08-13",4.2,"An excellent example of the style, especially when served cask conditioned. Smooth and quaffable, have more than one. Malt is forward, with chocolate, caramel and some fig notes. Light hops in the finish.

When I encounter this with a bitter, I also have a mild and bitter.","Munchen an der Willamette, Oregon, USA","troopie"
3506,"2016-01-09",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2017 Re-rate: had this on cask at Brouwers and I feel like its a much different beer. Toasted malts, chocolate, light earth, full of flavor throughout the pint. Thin bodied and easy to knock back but damn tasty. 
(Original rate: Bottle labeled ""Dark Mild"" but Im pretty sure this is the same beer. Dark brown. Earth, light biscuit, toasted malt, some fruit notes. Not all that interesting and a bit watery. )","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
3506,"2015-04-07",3.6,"Cask pour at Special Brews. About time I track this beer down. Mild ales are harder to track down than I expected. Seems like some mild ales are being classified as other things. Opinions I guess. Pours a near black color with a ton of tan cream head and lacing. Beautiful cask pour. Flavor is a little nutty, some chocolate malt, and some sweet caramel. Finishes a little on the plastic side, which was odd, but it didnt ruin this for me at all. Good beer to session with. Good stuff.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
3506,"2015-02-03",3.2,"Tap@ Machine. Dark brown pour with lasting airy head.  Toasty, black malt, dark chocolate aromas. Soft mouthfeel with low co2. Nice dry chocolate, earthy mineral, medium roast flavors---no real flaws---well done for the style","Same Trailer, Different Park, Louisiana, USA","AmEricanbrew"
3506,"2015-01-18",3.4,"Half pint at brewery. Big cask head. Dark brown body. Aroma all light earthy with light chocolate. Musty wet malts. Flavor very light and dusty/musty and the main component of flavor comes in at the end with a bitter kick. In line with everything else at this brewery.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
3506,"2015-01-10",3.3,"Cask at the brewery - turbid dark brown - aroma is fairly chocolatey, kind of like tootsie rolls, actually - surprising level of hop character - flavor is kind of similar - a fair amount of chocolate, some tobacco, leafy bitterness - moderately bitter, mushroom/earthy finish - tastes better than it smells - decent - a little sweet.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
3506,"2014-12-08",3.2,"On cask at Machine House, pours a murky dark brown with a small head. Aroma brings out English hops and chocolate malt - with a little wet cardboard. Flavour is true to style and really quite flavourful, with dry chocolate, wet cardboard and just enough hop content. Drinkable and enjoyable. Good mild.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
3506,"2014-12-07",3.2,"Pump - Dark fruit and a odd astringent note. Deep brown with no head. Roast, toast, cocoa and some dark fruit. Nice, easy drinking and complex, just a weird nose.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
3506,"2014-06-13",3.0,"on cask at cask-o-rama. Pitch brown pour. Aroma of day old coffee. Tastes like barley tea. big char choco. Watery palate. Sorta slimy oats. I wish I liked it more than I do.","Seattle, Alabama, USA","nealblind"
3506,"2014-05-10",3.7,"Draught. Pours a very dark brown color with effectively no head on it. Nose is slightly bitter, and has some almost porter-like qualities to it. Taste is light and extremely smooth, with a lot of roasting to it. Drinks almost like a very mild porter.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"
3506,"2014-02-09",3.7,"Hand-pulled at brewpub. Strong flavor from a medium bodied English mild. Solid, slight sour and rich flavor. Smooth tasty drinker, well done!","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
3506,"2013-11-21",2.5,"Dark Mild

Pours deep brown, min head.

Smell...mild. Bit of light roast.

Taste smooth roast on the tail.

Very simple, plain beer.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Smurf2055"
3506,"2013-08-06",3.7,"Amber in color, clear with a thin head. This was a super tasty mild ale. Machine house is hitting the British ales out of the house.","Olympia, Washington, USA","BrewDad"
3506,"2013-06-09",3.9,"Firkin @ Baileys Taproom...  This is awesome!  Poured deep, dark brown with little-to-no head.  Nice sweet bready malts on the nose.  Tasted similar to the aroma.  Smooth, creamy mouthfeel.  Nutty, hazelnuts, malts.  Low bitterness.  Quite sessionable of course.  I could drink this all day.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
3506,"2013-06-09",3.7,"From firkin at Baileys Taproom. Deep, dark brown color. Aroma of coffee and roasted malts. Great flavor of coffee and dark chocolate. Reminds me of a stout, but less heaviness.","Oregon, USA","pdx77"
3506,"2013-03-30",3.2,"UPDATED: MAR 30, 2014 Opaque black amber. with a luscious frothy caramel cover. Not much nose, just a hint of roastyness. The body is medium roastyness over a light body with a dry coffee finish.Packs a lot of character for a ""mild"" ale. Re-rated: 3-29-30: My second experience with this brew is much the same as the first. This mild ale benefits from cacao nuances and a light dusty roastiness.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
3506,"2013-02-23",3.8,"Nose of nutty chocolate roast wet dog and moss. Good aroma. Pours dark brown nice bubbly heads and what have you. Flavors of roasty chocolate nutty malt smooth very mild sweetness.  Light moss and mineral. Fuck yeah too bad its not aged in a barrel or deemed rare. Fuck you idiot fags.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
3506,"2013-02-17",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 19, 2013 Draft.  Ive had this on both cask at the brewery and on tap, lightly force carbonated keg to emulate the cask feel.  Dark clean clear walnut brown with light tan ring of a head.  Beautiful roasted malt, hazelnut skins, faint toffee malt some buttery caramel...lots of clean flavorful roast.  Smooth light nutty coffee roast.  Every time I have this beer, and that had been several pints to date, I just fall in love with the fact that I can get it fairly readily and I just want to crush pints.  Love it, even though if it may be a little heavily roasted for the style.","Washington, USA","bvc"
3506,"2013-02-16",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2013 On engine at the brewery. Pours a near opaque mahogany with a loose and sudsy tan head. Nice crisp toasty brown bread crust nose. Soft light body, very low carb. Toasty bread crust mid palate with dry leaves. Light finish. Soft and.easy session.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
