1400,"2014-05-25",3.7,"Transfer from BA review on 3-25-12 - 

Poured from bottle into pint glass 

Appearance  Pours a beep brown color with a huge billowy off white head. The head is very porous with huge bubbles trapped within. The head fades very slowly to give some nice lacing.

Smell  Sweeter toffee aromas are the most prevalent. These are mixed with a bit of banana and some good breadiness.

Taste  Malty through and through. A nice roasted malt flavor is present all the way through the taste experience. Up front it is a bit on the medium dry side and seems to gain sweetness as the taste experience advances; mainly toffee and brown sugar flavors come into play. Toward the end the a little bit of fruit flavors come into play and leave a nice smooth taste on the tongue.

Mouthfeel  The mouthfeel is a bit on the creamier side with a lower level of carbonation. This makes for a very easy drinking and very enjoyable mouthfeel giving the nice malty flavors a chance to really permeate the tongue.

Overall  Very easy drinking with a nice taste profile. I would say it would make a great beer for a lighter fish meal (balancing out the lightness with some nice thick, but not too thick, maltiness) or for session drinking with a friend on a cooler fall day.","","Darkmagus82"
1400,"2013-12-31",3.4,"(Backlog) 12 oz Bottle. Clear, brown colored with burgundy tinges, and has an off white head. The smell is malts, dough, nuts, rich, savory, and deep. The taste is more basic, malts, roast, and ok.","Arlington, Texas, USA","jkwalking05"
1400,"2013-10-20",3.6,"Appearance:
Deep garnets and burnt ambers under a light khaki head which fades into a blotchy layer that grows thicker as it sticks to the glass.

Nose:
Pumpernickel and dark stone fruits such as prunes and raisins. Tendrils of European chocolates weave in and out. Whole grain breads intermingle with the pumpernickel breads.

Palate:
Smooth silky mouthfeel carry a gentle river of treacle, prunes, and raisins across my tastebuds. Prune infused raisins breads and pumpernickel breads. Slightly dry tannic finish of apple skins keeps it from growing too sweet with the dark fruits. Chocolate truffle powder and nutmeg in the breath.

Final Thoughts:
A fine American craft beer example of a German style dunkel, aka, dark lager. Fresh moist dark breads and fruits truly live up to the standard of liquid bread. A tasteful winner of Samuel Adams honorable LongShot homebrew contest.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

1400,"2013-07-06",3.5,"Sampled on 7/5/2013. This Dunkel pours a dark brown color from a 12oz bottle. Small to medium sized white foamy head. With nice lacing and decent retention. The aroma is fruity and sweet, bready and slightly roasty. A medium bodied dunkel. The malts are roasty, fruity and sweet, hint of dark fruit. The hops are herbal. Decent carbonation. A fairly smooth, slightly sweet dunkel. Its missing the big sweetness that one would expect in a dunkel, but it has enough sweetness to carry the flavor. Very drinkable. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

1400,"2012-12-26",3.0,"Another thoughtful tick from drabmuh. Thanks Matt.

The beer is dark chestnut with russet highlights when held to the light. The head is light tan colored and leaves sparse lacing on the pint glass.

The aroma is mild, but I get faint whiffs of brown bread, biscuits, lager.

The flavor picks things up a bit, with some grain, bread, a touch of alcohol, and a dry finish. Some fruit and nut characters emerge as the beer warms.

Light in body and pretty smooth sailing, with a lingering lag presence. A touch of bitterness in the finishes adds balance.

Overall, this was ok.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, dark reddish amber that was nearly brown in the glass with a small, off-white head that kept a thin sheet.

The initial flavor was light to moderately sweet and slightly bitter; while the finish was moderately sweet and slightly sour with an average duration. There was caramel, dark bread, spicy yeast, roasted malt, nutty malt, prune, other dark fruit, doughy yeast and milk chocolate.

1400,"2012-06-23",3.8,"Picked up the Longshot series from BevMo in Mission Valley, San Diego, Calif. Poured from a bottle into a pint glass. About 1 ½ fingers of head. Color was dark red, almost brown. Light tan lacing on the top. Average retention. 

Smelled dark chocolate and coffee malts. Also some caramel in there, and some dark fruits, mainly cherry. Slighty reminded me of the Sam Adams Cherry Boch. 

First thing that stood out with the taste was the smoothness. Got dark chocolate, light coffee, toffee and cherry. Got some Riesen candy in there as well. 

Medium-to-full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long-lasting, smooth finish.

Really liked this beer, a bit better than the Longshot Derfs Secret Alt that I just had. Just smooth and consistent.","","User134089"

Malty and somewhat sweet aroma, with notes of caramel, faint roast, chocolate, hazelnut and black bread, a touch of raisin appearing when the glass is swirled a bit.    Clear deep, dark brown in color with a lasting, fine, ivory head.  Flavor is similarly full of sweet, dark maltiness, more chocolate, breadiness and some very faint dark fruitiness apparent here and there, but this is balanced out rather well by lightly spicy, herbal hop tones and a light-moderate degree of bitterness.  A pleasant roasted nut quality appears towards the finish, which is otherwise clean and malty.  Smooth and creamy on the palate with a low amount of effervescence and a medium body.  Enjoyable, certainly recommended to any fans of the style.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

1400,"2012-06-03",3.4,"This is definitely an Americanized take on this style. And by American, I mean it is somewhat over the top when German brews nearly never are. This has an extremely strong, even exaggerated Munich-malt presence. Its a nice brown color w/ a fine-bubbled but small white head. Nose is rich and wonderful w/ the toasty chocolatey Munich-malt presence I mentioned but it gets just a touch oversweet when you taste it--though there is a light green herbal bitterness in the finish to help balance.

The taste is pretty clean and crisp even with this sizable load of various roasted malts. I get nearly dark roasted malts, chocolate malts and a hint of coffee as well as sweet dark fruity esters such as blueberries and prunes.

Theres also a decent amount of lacing.  The beer smells like caramel and toasted malt, nuts, chocolate, and a bit of toffee.  Taste is mostly like the aroma, but theres also a bit of brown sugar and spice (maybe nutmeg?) noticeable.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit creamy with a good amount of carbonation.

Maybe a hint of chocolate in there as well. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a solid malty grainy mouthfeel. I enjoyed this one a bit more than the other two in the sixer.

1400,"2012-04-09",3.3,"A: Pours a dark ruby-tinged copper colored body with about middling clarity. The three finger light tan colored head fades quickly, but leaves plenty of interspersed lacing on the glass.

S: Caramel, toffee, and toasted malts lead the way, with a solid noble aspect making itself known a bit later on. Not the strongest or most complex smell, but it works.

T: Its pretty simple here, toasted malts mixed with caramel, toffee, and hazelnut; finishing with a grassy, earthy note. Not very flavorful or heavy, but incredibly easy to drink, so Ill be a little kinder with the score. This would pair well with a Mexican dish, such as chicken enchiladas in mole sauce.

M: Lighter bodied with little dryness in the finish, and good carbonation. Can seem slightly watery at times.

O: Decent, but pretty nondescript. Luckily, it manages to have a superbly high drinkability factor, so its good for those who dont want an extreme beer, or those who want something to go along with food. Even though this one is just pretty good, Id like to think that the Longshot 6-pack has been a success overall.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"
