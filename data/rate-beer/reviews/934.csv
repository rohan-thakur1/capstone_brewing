934,"2017-02-19",3.7,"Can. See through basic brown color with ample head. Slight hop characteristics, pine, malt, caramel and citrus. Intriguing and different. Super smooth.","West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA","60minuteman"
934,"2017-02-19",4.3,"Smells like a sour, but not as pungent. The taste is really smooth like a lager but you can pick up tones of a sour citrus and even hints of oat. Really unique!!","West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA","abdiorio"
934,"2016-12-24",3.7,"Can poured a clear reddish amber with a lasting creamy amber head. Aromas of caramel, graininess and light spicy hops. Palate was light bodied and crisp with a smooth dry finish. Flavors of caramel, light graininess and a hint of earthiness with a smooth dry lingering caramel finish.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
934,"2016-11-13",3.1,"Tap. Poured light copper color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate balanced aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Expectation met.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
934,"2016-03-31",2.9,"On tap at Buffalo Wild Wings Fort Myers. Light colored ale, very mild aroma of barley. Not very flavorful, no hops, kinda watery. Finish is quick and bot much sticks around. Not bad but not my thing, too light.","Budapest, HUNGARY","Cristobal37"
934,"2016-03-23",3.3,"16 oz can @ Hammond Stadium. Pours clear copper with thin white head. Aroma is thin, surprisingly roasty malt; no hops to speak of. Taste is similar - thin, heavily roasted pale malt; sweet notes mid-palate brown sugar, cinnamon, and apple make an appearance. Light hops linger slightly bitter on the finish. I didnt get much citrus. Decently pleasant take on the common style.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"
934,"2016-03-15",3.3,"Fort Myers, Fl - Fort Myers Ale House - on tap. Sparkling, light orange pour, soft, snow-white head, a fair bit of lacing. Aroma has some brown sugar notes, hints of  dried fruit. Yeasty, light citrus flavor, some earthiness, sweet brown sugar, caramel in the finish. Very refreshing after a long drive and a presentation before heading to the airport. Thick enough mouthfeel.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
934,"2015-07-21",3.0,"An all-around/year round easy drinking beer. On the can says ""Florida Common"", which I guess is this style with a tropical twist. Tasting mild fruit notes on the finish...mango or apricot. Flavor reminded me a bit like MH #9...with some light caramel malt. Decent dinner pairing brew.","Winter Park, Florida, USA","Jabah"
