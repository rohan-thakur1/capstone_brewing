530,"2017-06-13",4.2,"Bottle from Beers of Europe. Pours brown with a touch of black raspberry. Very little visible carbonation and almost no head. Chocolate, hazelnut, slight suggestions of honey and leather. The taste blows me away: sweet and laden with lightly spiced honeyed notes. Theres a gorgeous balancing hoppy bitterness, but the foreground is all about the slightly spicy sumptuousness. Cinnamon, liquorice, rosemary and a touch of horehound lead up to the long finish. Gooey mouthfeel and it feels a lot more carbonated than it looks, giving the body strength. A prince of an ale.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","jjsint"

530,"2017-01-08",3.8,"33ml bottle, callared since 2007. Interesting nose of poached pears with cinnamon under the cap. In the glass, it follows with a malty barley wine smell, with just a little bit of phenol from aging. Color is deep brown to black with just a tiny ring of foam at the edge.
Taste starts of with a very thin, non-carbonated mouthfeel. Well, thats the UK style, I guess. An old recipe meant to be experienced, perhaps, from cask. It does get pretty warming after I put my goblet down. But it could also be due to age. Can hold that against the brewer, since this did have a ""Best Before June 2011"" on the label. So I try to adjust. Spice is not as prominent as it might be. Sediment at the bottom, but it stays in the bottle, no yeast to decent like a Belgian beer.

This one a 2012 vintage and by vague memory - no notes for my last visit - this seems to be smashingly consistent but not without its own nuances. Into a Traquair tulip at cellar temperature. Deepest ruby with good clarity and a shimmering radiance when held to the lights. Head holds at just a half finger of tight, shiny beige-ish cream. Doughy, thick, molten chocolate pudding nose with inklings of anise, mace, green peppercorn, leather, sweet berries like strawberries, light vanillin and a good whiff of tawny port. It is dessert-like on the palate, well melded and on a sweeter-tip. Quite dusty in the back; earthy with an aniseed/juniper-like spice that lasts long between each sip. It is dominated by decadent vanilla chocolate icecream. A little age has given it strong madeira and light sherry notes. The body light but its soft suppleness and amped flavours give it plenty of moorish appeal. Alcohol melds into it - noting the madeira. Earthy, musty and leathery undertones add extraordinary depth.

Looks: Clear, deep burgundy black colour; Two finger head and crumpety light beige foam which lasted for 2 minutes; Fairly good sticky lacing and very slight carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and rich Ale malt, with strong Sherry, chocolate, strong plums and dark fruits, caramel, toffee, cream, vanilla, sugar and yeast.

Taste: Mid to strong sweet rich dark malt, with strong coriander, strong Sherry, strong red wine, red fruits, caramel, molasses, alcohol, biscuits, strong yeast, liquorices, lemon, moderate bitter hop and light grass.

Body: Mid to light body. Thin but fairly slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Incredibly rich dark maltyness despite the seemingly light body. A blitz of aged Sherry, red wine, coriander and tasty alcohol hit me instantly and they taste just right. Just how often do I say that! Coriander taste is perhaps the strongest Ive had from a beer, not those wimpy flashes from Belgian Whites. These coriander is strong, veggy and for real. Yes! It mixes so well with those aged winey taste this is heavenly!

Hoppiness: Not much in aroma. Lemon, nice liquorice and light grass in taste. Bitterness is moderate at best as it share with Sherry and liquorices for a lasting mid to light sweet-bitter finish.

After Taste: Slightly dry. Refreshing and sweet to mouth.

Comments: While its House Ale is full on Wee Heavy, this one is insanely malty yet veg-refreshing at the same time. The coriander and aged winey taste works like magic, its intense but in a relaxing way. Great for sessions as well as chill out. Excellent!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

3.0 A: Deep brown, nearly black, color. One and a half fingers of frothy beige head. Retention is below average and not much of any lacing is left.

4.25 S: Might not look great, but it smells great. Coriander hits you right on the first whiff and hits you hard. Earthy peatiness, light roastiness, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, mineral, and some spicy phenols. Very nice, but could use a bit more power.

4.0 T: Like the nose, the coriander is readily apparent. Underneath you find much of what the nose has: earthy peat, light roast, brown sugar, molasses, caramel. Mineral and phenols are upped somewhat in the taste. Though I love the taste of coriander, it does dominate the brew. Whether or not that is a bad thing, I dont know. But it does prevent a deeper inspection as to how the flavors mesh. Still, damn good.

3.5 M: Medium to heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Somewhat slippery feel. Could use some more creaminess, but good enough.

4.0 D: I probably rated this higher than it deserves, but I love coriander so thats how it is. Worth a try either way though. Solid all around.

Rich malty and spicy aroma which initially reminded me a lot of Rochefort 10, with impressions of banana, caramel candy, coriander, port wine, cloves, eucalyptus, raisins, pear, cognac, marzipan, chocolate, hazelnut paste, red wine, liquorice. Sweet onset, candied dates and cherries, rounded, rather thick and oily palate, smooth with a deep caramelly, nutty and eventually more chocolatey maltiness, adorned with strongish retronasal spiciness (especially coriander seed, subjective impressions of drop and cloves) with drying effect, further spreading into the satisfying, long and warm finish where some liqueurish alcohol, leafy hops and dark bittersweet malts are beautifully interwoven.

Taste is equally autumny, with molasses, plums and apples, and a considerable alcoholic zing after its warmed for a while (also on the nose). Its a bit like a weaker version of some Barley Wine.

Klasszikus illat ez, egy efféle elegáns megjelenésű, nagy hagyományokról árulkodó küllemű főzethez egyebet el sem lehetne képzelni. Könnyed és élénk karakter fogad minket ezután, melyhez azonban fajsúlyos ízek kapcsolódnak. Aszalt gyümölcsök, kékszőlő zamatai képezik a befőttszerű, illetve gazdag malátás, édeskés alapízt - mely összetevők a végízben is szinte teljes mértékben mentesek maradnak bármiféle kesernyés, komlós befolyástól -, ebbe kapaszkodik aztán a koriander rendkívül pezsdítő karaktere (a fűszerek közül jóformán az egyetlen, mely nyilvánvalóvá válik számomra). Ez a jellemvonás pazarul árnyalja a képet, általa sokkal könnyedebbé és frissebbé alakul át az ízek színezete. Ez esetben tehát egyáltalán nem tűnik erőltetettnek, vagy olcsónak, külön életet élőnek, vagy rendszeridegennek a fűszer jelenléte, fantasztikusan simul bele a környezetbe, az ízek folytatójának nagyszerű szerepét tölti be. Az alkohol ennél kissé harsányabban van jelen melengető hatásával, ami viszont részemről teljesen elfogadható jellegzetesség, ameddig az ennek ellentétéhez vezető út határvonalát nem lépi át és stílusos tud maradni. Ez esetben ez így is történt, lényegében az egyébként is karakteres ital pátoszát erősítve. Örömmel fogyasztanám máskor is.","HUNGARY","adster"

Lingering notes of caramel, raisin, plum, cherry, fig, pear, toast, toffee, oak, brown bread, light chocolate, herbal, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity of dark malt, yeast ester, and moderate oak flavors; with a great malt/yeast flavor balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and lightly slick/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding scotch ale. All around awesome complexity and balance of dark malt, yeast ester, and moderate oak flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Corpo possente, sapori articolati di caramello, cioccolato, aromi di tostatura e forse anche nocciola; il tutto comunque molto ben bilanciato.
Finale quasi dolciastro ed alcolico, lascia un ottimo e persistente retrogusto.

530,"2013-03-31",4.1,"I feel obliged to begin this review with a little history. I have a particular affinity for this beer based on name alone. The whole reason I exist is because my Jacobite ancestor was booted out of Scotland in the 1600s. He settled in Goochland, VA and the rest is history--literally. 

The beer pours a gorgeous clear, dark ruby-amber color. Its not just clear. It is like a colored, solid glass paper weight. Imagine how light looks when it passes through an object like that. It has a light taupe colored head. The head consists of the microbubbles often seen in nitro-infused beers. The aroma is mild, but rich with toffee and sorghum. The mouthfeel is medium- to full-bodied, wet, and slick. A bit dry on the finish, but only enough to balance things. Sweet sorghum emerges first with faint lemongrass coming in late. I dont pick up the corriander, but this beer seems to be all about balance. So it could just be absorbed into the overall expression of flavor. Its very drinkable and a nicely engineered beer.","Pensacola, Florida, USA","DocJitsu"

530,"2013-03-13",3.7,"Reviewed 1/31/13. 16.9 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a very dark burgundy color. The head is a one finger eggshell shade with short retention. A small collar is left around the edges of the glass, as well.

S: Extremely dark fruit forward. Raisins, plums, cherries, figs, caramel, chocolate, molasses, licorice, and coriander are all on the nose at varying points. A budding oak quality comes out as it warms some. I really like the integration between both the sweet and herbal aspects.

T: At first, its vaguely chocolaty, but it seems like the opening flavors arent too impressive. If anything, this really picks up after the midtaste, where the dark fruit character becomes quite strong. Its finish sees a return of the chocolate notes, some molasses, pumpernickel bread, and a toffee quality almost reminiscent of a doppelbock. The distant aftertaste is where the coriander goes from being integrated within the caramel malt sweetness to being its own distinct note. In lieu of hops, the coriander and oak properties nicely balances the malty base.

M: Not as sweet or as syrupy as I expected (thankfully). The oak does a good job of drying out the finish some - unfortunately it has too much influence on the texture, rendering it a bit insubstantial feeling and excessively tannic. The dry, abrupt end gives it excellent drinkability, at the cost of some complexity and richness - but it also cuts down the sweetness admirably. Its a wash, really.

O: I didnt expect to finish this one so quickly. Its the exact same problem I had with Sucaba - Im amazed at how fast I can kill a bottle of it, but I cant help but want this to be a more decadent and savorable treat with less barrel influence. Still, despite my complaints, this is a very good offering.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Pours deep dark ruby red color with a minimal head on the sides. Aroma of ripe fruits like raisins and plums, some herbal notes, hints of licorice and some dark malts, caramel and mild wooden notes as well. Flavor of ripe fruits, sweetish caramel, mild chocolaty malts leads to a faint licorice finish. Some belgian strong ale elements seem to have appeared. Silky smooth palate, some rougher edges have refined in three years, maybe a bit too much though. Still an excellent brew.

Poured into my Westmalle chalice: Ruby red with only a thin collar and mini wisp for a topping.

The smell at first was vinous, then comes dark chocolate, red berries and plum bread all at once, lovely.

This is my sort of beer, rich, almost smooth: the semi-sharpness of the hop bitterness reminds you this isnt supposed to be soft, its a Scotch Ale not a Milk Stout! There are a multitude of flavours to find: spices from the Orient, berries from the forest, dried fruits in a Christmas cake, malts from a distillery, haggis from the hills. Take a sip and close your eyes, wonderful: let your taste buds go crazy.

This is a warming, winters brew and so, so well made: the alcohol is well hidden, comes out towards the end of the drying mouth, but not harsh or unpleasant, just letting you know that the car keys should be given to someone else.

Aroma is a complex combination of licorice, dark chocolate, caramel, light coffee, notes of red wine, and coriander-based notes of citrus, white grapes, tea, and even eau de cologne. Wow, this is complex! The coriander is less prominent than in a typical witbier for example and goes lovely with the ""dark"" aroma elements (licorice and dark chocolate). Seriously, I could just enjoy the beer by only sniffing it. Flavour-wise licorice and coriander are at the forefront, backed by a more subtle presence of chocolate and caramel. Light bitter finish with an aftertaste of licorice, coriander, white grapes, orange and chocolate. Fantastically hidden alcohol. Very aromatic beer yet at the same time subtle and mellow, devoid of any harshness - using wooden tuns by the brewery serves it really well.

Really no bitterness. Sweet, light palate. Ending a bit papery.

530,"2011-11-01",4.0,"THOUGHTS: Nice. Very herbal. A little like a beer version of Jägermeister at first. But then it changed. A little herbal and very malty. Not far off from a very good wee heavy, really. The coriander wasnt very noticeable as a distinct flavor or aroma. It just added an herbal or spice undertone. Id like to try to age some of this bad boy. It has a lot of potential. Hid alcohol well.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured and extremely dark red that looked brown to black in the glass with bright red highlights and a large to huge, off-white head that mostly diminished and left fair lacing. It also had nice carbonation. The aroma had heavy caramel, molasses and chocolate; raisin, prune, toffee, maple syrup, cherry cola, dark pruney fruit, some herbs and little smoke and soy sauce. The initial flavor was moderately sweet; while the finish was heavily sweet, slightly bitter and lightly sour. There was cherry cola, molasses, caramel, chocolate, prune, raisin, other dark fruit, smoke, some herbs which might be the coriander, they slight spice and a little soy.

An immediate waft of apricot and cranberry escapes the glass as soon as I pick it up to get a sniff. As it approaches my nose these lighter fruits are replaced by toffee apple and damson jam. A lightly bitter medium sweet beer with caramelised vinous flavours, fairly sticky and full bodied, though at the same time surprisingly light for such a dark beer. Im not sure which spices are used in the brew, but they certainly help to disguise the high ABV (8%) which makes it dangerous quaffable. Faint taste of ginger gives way to a long and fruity finish, leaving the taste of a good port in your mouth. Im a fan [330ml bottle]","NORTHERN IRELAND","Beersiveknown"
530,"2011-05-07",3.7,"Chevy Case, DC 11.2 ($7): Was excited to see this and decided it was worth a buy. Pours a blackish brown with barely any head and barely any carbonation.

Smoke and a whole lot of spices, especially, to no ones surprise, coriander.

Medium bodied old ale flavor with spices, but very well balanced and subtle. I would guess that the coriander masks the alcohol a bit, because it does not seem like an 8% beer to me.

Medium bodied with a good balance of roast, sweet malt and spice. Lots of caramel and toffee flavor as well as some cocoa, hazelnut and licorice.

Poured into a snifter. The color is a nice, dark copper/caramel color with a very thin off white head that does not really leave behind any lacing at all. The nose is caramel, toffee, bread, and hints of dark fruits. Some slight alcohol there as well. The taste is fairly one dimensional with a faint caramel and toffee sweetness. No really fruit presence. Perhaps a bit of nuttiness. Medium mouthfeel with fairly low carbonation and a bit of booze. Fairly plain without much going on; this was a bit of a disappointment.

It is not as sweet as the aroma would suggest, it has a dry aftertaste with some alcohol.

The nose gives hints of chocolate and toffee with a touch of alcohol; somewhat resembling an aged English barley wine.  The palate is full and somewhat (but not overly) sweet and malty.  Again, it shows a moderate amount of chocolate and a more subtle note of toffee, along with a floral note.

Flavor is lightly sweet with dried, dark fruits, milk chocolate, coriander, roasted malt, vanilla, licorice spice tea.  Pretty unique, complex, and gourmet.

530,"2009-12-17",4.2,"""Ye Jacobites by name, yer faults I will proclaim,"" goes the auld Scots song but Im damned if I can find any flaws to proclaim. This is an elegant sipping ale, sweet, sticky, lightly spiced and very moreish for its strength. In the glass, its as black as the Butcher Cumberlands heart and keeps its head better than my clan chief, who lost his at the hands of the Hanoverians after the last Jacobite rebellion ended in bloody defeat at Culloden - beheaded in London. The aroma is subtle and enticing - clove, blackcurrants, chocolate pudding and yeast. Perfect mouthfeel - soft and creamy. Incredibly easy-drinking for an 8% ale. Theres not a hint of alcohol in a beautifully balance flavour mix. Tiramisu, soft chocolate, yum. A true regional classic and probably the best Scottish beer Ive had to date.

530,"2009-08-09",4.5,"Realizing that for all I had quaffed of the Traquair House Ale, I had yet to sup on their equally divine Jacobite Ale; ale brewed with hops, malt, yeast, water, and coriander. Simple is best, and I have a feeling that he is going to sweep me off my feet, and my life will never be the same.


Deep browns, blacks, and burnt mahogany settles into my glass underneath a shy khaki head which lingers as a thin layer. No lace yet, but with a couple tender swirls, fragile lace leave their mark on my glass. I raise his liquid nirvana to my nose, and the first and only thing I can think of to say is: Wow! Awesome! Heavenly! I am swept away beyond what words can describe, but I am going to try. Ooey gooey sticky dark fruits: dates, plums, prunes, figs, raisins. Rich Swiss chocolates melt under the warmth of her gaze, drowning sweet black cherries while truffles make sweet love to toffee and caramel nougat. Prune juice, anise, chocolate pudding and pudding bread lead into a dry bitter chocolate finish which is all Hersheys syrup and coffee. Permeating his nose is coriander, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Im not sure what I have done of late to deserve such a perfect presentation of Beervana, but I am not going to count my luck. Judging by his nose, my first sup of Jacobite Ale must come under eyes closed, heightening my sense of smell and taste. As his dark nectar hits my lips, a chill runs from the tip of my toe to the top of my head. Goosebumps tingle and hairs stand on end. Clean and smooth, he is delicately sweet with toffee and caramel chocolate truffles melting in my mouth, sending shivers up and down my spine. I pause before exhaling cinnamon, nutmeg, and coriander. The Hershey syrup adds a touch of roughness to his palate which complements the darker, dryer side of fresh brewed coffee and espresso. His middle is a juicy chewy cornucopia of the moistest dates, prunes, plums, figs, and raisins. Chocolate mousse, pudding bread, and holiday spices marked by coriander continue to fill out his palate. Rich and enveloping, I am drowning in sweet ecstasy. The Jacobite Ale is not cloying in any way, shape, fashion, and form. His palate is rich, but his body and mouthfeel is light, clean, and exquisitely balanced. My lips become coated with dry earthy finish even as prune juice lingers in with a supple kiss. I dont want this moment to end, but all good things must eventually come to an end, I suppose. That hasnt stopped me from stocking my cellar with 6 more bottles, though.


The Traquair House Jacobite Ale is heaven descended, and I pray that Traquair never stops making this beer, or any of their beers for that matter. The big players can go fly a kite, and I hope they get carried away into the atmosphere by a freak storm, never to return. Jacobite has reminded me all over again why Beer is so much more than just a beverage: it is Passion personified.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

530,"2009-07-14",3.8,"2004 Bottle.  Snifter, Interestig head, large bubble, in a shortly lingering head.  The nose is an odd melange of coriander, sherry oxidation(soured toffee, think Oloroso), and silky sweet malt.  In all honesty, the whole lot smells like fresh blueberries.  I cant explain that one.  The palate is amazingly lithe and and rolls across the palate as the etheral spice tickles the tongue.  Yes, you will have to get over a small amount of oxidation, but Im really starting to think that its beginning to blow off.   Maybe Im just getting over it myself?   Blueberries seem to meld into more green vegetale spice. the oxidation begins to smell of an old leather jacket.  Not bad.  After the fancy foot spice fades the palate is left with a touch of brown bread and roasted malt that add a certain complexity that draws the quaffer back for another thought.  This beer, at this age very much reminds me of drinking an old vintage port.  Alcohol warmth only speaks as it closes the door and the chest is warmed.  Scotland indeed.   While a little oxidized, this beer scores major points with its development over 5 years.  I dont think this any more age and honestly, it probably hit its stride around 3 years. Loses some points for price. 90","Charleston, USA","Bigsilky"

530,"2009-04-27",3.8,"In short: A clean and lean dark ale with a wide flavour spectrum.  Excellent.
How: Bottle 330ml.  Many many times.  This rating for a 6+ months old bottle
The look: Clear dark ruby-mahogany body topped by a beige ring of foam
In long: Nose of crème-caramel and dark fruits.  Body is lean, a bit too much for the style, I would prefer a more corpulent body for this beer.  Soft carbonation.  Taste is molasses, black liquorice, some dark fruits, caramel and black pepper spiciness.  I dont know what herbs they use (Traditional Ales dont use hops I think) but there is a strong tobacco leaves flavour in there.  Finish is black pepper and tobacco leaves.  Because of the extra-clean/lean body the alcohol is showing a bit despite the relatively low abv.  The beer has a lot going for it with many cohesive flavour elements and it is highly drinkable.  Very very good yet it is too clean and lean, and imho it is not the world-class beer that so many others make it to be.  Still, Ive been drinking the Jacobite on a regular basis for a while and I will continue doing so because this is a very good (almost excellent) beer that is widely available.  Seems to be Scotland most appreciated beer export.  A traditional ale that Scottish have been drinking for many years during their annual eight weeks of fog and rain.

Deep near black body with small dense tan head. Leaves good lace and legs on the way down.

Pours a medium to dark brown with a copper tint and a moderate amount of light tan head. Overly sweet taste. Brown ale-like taste: Nutty, especially hazelnut. Not nearly enough hops. Not as spicy as I expected, but the coriander comes forth in the finish. Light body. Moderately lively in the palate. Theres something non-beer-like about this beer, probably related to the low hopping rates. Thats too bad, since I like beer.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
530,"2009-04-01",3.9,"11.2 fl oz bottle.  The aroma is very heavy on the coriander (orange zest and a light spicy nuttiness), and if smelling this blind, i would almost think that Im about to drink a white ale.  On further whiff however, its darker, toastier toffee bread malt character comes through, making this a highly interesting smelling beer.   The pour is fairly unremarkable a light fizzy head and medium appearing body but the color of the beer is a nice hue of dark mahogany.  Most aspects of the flavor match the aroma very well, and surprisingly this combination works very well together along with the other notes of fig, green apples, and a mild floral bitterness.  The mouthfeel is suberb as the drink hits with the right amount of punch to the let flavors capture your attention, but at the same time allowing them to run gently and smoothly down the back of your throat.  If i wouldnt have had bad connotations associated with past beer experiences with coriander prominence (aka witbier), i would have enjoyed this one even more.  With that said, this is still a very well made and unique piece of brewing that made for quite an enjoyable experience.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"

The beer starts out with a dark brown/amber pour with a small/medium sized 1-finger thick cap. The aromas I could detect were slightly fruity (oranges and dates), a bit of brandy, toffee..even a bit of Pepsi somehow (strange). A nicely sweetend flavor with notes of roasted malts, rum soaked raisins or maybe cherries and brandy...vanilla pops up too. A great winter time beer. Picked the perfect time to drink it too.

This has been sitting unintentionally in the cellar for a few months.  I finally discovered it the other day ad thought now was as good a time as any.  After trying it I would not mind having another bottle.  This time however I will pick it up when I am ready to drink it; let the store do the storage so I get one that is fresher.

Aroma / Appearance - A half finger foamy head combined with the ruby red body to create a picturesque beer.  A thin sheet of lacing hinted at the promise to come.  Cinnamon, spice, powdered chocolate, dates, and fig make it a sweet profile.  It seems like a less alcoholic old ale but that could be due to the cellaring.

Flavor / Palate - Persimmons and plum fill the palate.  Next comes an odd blend of dried mango, orange, and spice.  This one is hard to pigeonhole but whatever it is I like it.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Rugged old brandy and other sweet alcohol aromas, that are hard to get past.  Not unlike a Barleywine at first sip, but the coriander really balances the beer, giving it a nice sweet, drinkable character.  With the taste and aroma, you know you are ingesting serious alcohol, but at 8%, you arent really quite as phased as would be expected.  Quite enjoyable.  Would love to sample fresh.

530,"2008-08-09",3.9,"Appearance: Pours a dark, chestnut brown body that picks up some reddish hints when held up to the light. Also, a thin, ivory-colored head!

Smell: Dark malt aroma yields a scent of caramel and brown sugar alongside notes of plums and oven-toasted coriander seeds, which, being a popular gin ingredient rightly has me thinking of gin.

Taste: Dark maltiness with tastes of dark brown sugar, maple syrup, and nuts. Pleasing, though never overwhelming sweetness. Faint dark fruitiness. Earthy, herbal coriander spice flavor, along with a mild bitterness and warming genever presence does a good job of tempering the malty sweetness. Leaves you with a lingering taste of pumpernickel bread.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-low carbonation. Slight stickiness to the mouthfeel.

Drinkability: A fine spiced ale. Plenty of complexity as well as overall restraint and balance to deliver an interesting, tasty brew.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

530,"2008-02-15",4.8,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2008 Nirvana in a bottle.  While Scottish, this brew is, in no way, representative of most Scottish ales.
Somewhat like its sister (Traquair House Ale), but a bit darker, a bit more flavor and a bit more alcohol.  While this brew uses almost the same ingredients, its just more ""grown up""...  more depth... colorwise, aromawise, and flavorwise.  The Traquair brewmaster shows off his skill in the surprising use of coriander... whereas most people immediately link spices such as coriander with Belgian brews, he deftly uses it in this brew... just enough... barely there flavorwise... it seems as though hes using it more for its ability to lighten things up... metamorphosing a beer that most people would expect to be heavy into a surprisingly light and easy to drink ale.

The corriander really dominates this beer.  I get a smidge of roasted character.  But most of the character is herbal citrus.  I even get the leaves of cilantro.

Small, yellowish-white head that fades leaving a nice ring of lace. The aroma is like nothing I have ever smelled.  Begins with some dark malts, a little molasses and spices, but quickly moves to something almost salty that makes me think of pizza dough for some strange reason.. As I take the first sip, the saltiness is all gone and the full on malt attack begins. The malts are very nice here--not too sweet and they are balanced very nicely with the coriander and hops.

Traquair Jacobite pours a clear garnet with glowing mahogany highlights when held directly to the light. One finger ecru head forms on the pour that falls to a skim coat rather quickly. Good looking brew.

This beer smells fantastic. Nothing at all like I thought it would smell. Jacobite has the usual aromas of roasted malts and a slight hint of chocolate. The big difference here is the coriander. It leaves an unbelievable refreshing orange aroma that makes this beer utterly unique.

Flavor is right along the lines of the aroma. Some toasted and roasted malts show themselves in the flavor. Theres a tremendous burst of flavor mid-palate from the generous amount of coriander used. Great refreshing orange and herbal character. Finishes with a solid dose of hops to balance things out.

This beer is about as easy drinking as you can find. The high abv is the only reason its not getting the highest rating possible. Very refreshing.

This beer just blows my mind. I expected nothing along these lines. The addition of coriander adds an amazing needed refreshing quality. This is a superb beer.

Starts with dark malt and plumminess, passing on to fairly spicey notes (coriander plus something else?). The mouthfeel is substantial. There seems to be some hop to go along with the malt and spice, but it all works simultaneously. The aftertaste is reminiscent of that of old fashioned Guinness, but not roasted/burnt enough to overcome the other flavors. Really great ale.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

Its something like a strong old ale with, of course, the prominent coriander character.  So thats what coriander character is like.  Dont waste time reading this trying to figure out what its like; just try it yourself.  Swirl it around in your tulip glass.  Savor it.  Sip it.  Do it until the end of the glass.

Pours a very dark brown with deep amber highlights. Theres a quarter inch head that fades rapidly to a thin spotty cap, with a fairly thin ring that leaves behind a tattered bit of lace.

Smell; the smell is very fruity with a little orange peel, plums, dates and apples. Theres pleasant smokey spiciness, with chocolate and caramel mixed in.

Taste; the orange comes out more strongly in the flavor, with the plums, berries and apples falling in behind. The roasted malts and smokey/peat flavors play off of the spices very nicely, and finishes with a rich chocolatey flavor.

A deep red-brown with basically no head; the aroma emanating from this brew is out-of-this-world:  caramel, floral pollen, brown sugar, bitter orange peel, wildflower honey.  In the mouth some of these aromas fade out considerably, leaving a mild taste dominated by sweetness through brown sugar, oranges, flowers.  Little to no bitterness but a strange sweet finish that I havent ever experienced before. The ale is smooth on the tongue but seemed to me a little bit flat; not exactly syrupy but not as put-together on the tongue as I wouldve hoped.

Spicy mid-palate after a roasty, toasty attack, with some mild bitterness in the finish and a perfectly modulated malt underpinning. Very, very well considered beer.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

The flavor is chocolatey, oatmeal-like, peat, tobacco, and powdered sugar.  75+% similar to a Scotch or Scottish ale with some flair added for uniqueness.

The flavor was intersting: spices (coriander), dark fruits, licorice, some chocolate, and rich maltiness, very balanced sweetness, spices, and light bitterness. The mouthfeel, however, was kinda thin, coming off like a weak porter or thin Scottish ale. Bump the ABV a bit and this is like some eisbocks Ive had.","","User37895"

530,"2006-05-06",4.4,"Muddy dark brown, nearly black. A rapid pour produced only a misty, bubbly, cap that flattened out super quickly. A semi oily residue coats the glass as only a few small strings and spots of tannish lace decides to stick.

Aroma is big and beautiful. Complexly dark and smokey with super dark, charred raisin and plum. Deeply tangy with a heavy set dark, thick molasses with a wonderfully little punch of peaty smokened alcoholic wamth within the nose thats quite portly.

Taste is just as good with a smooth display of darkened things that smoke and cinder on the palate with melting dark fruityness and saturated maltyness. Paled tang in sense with molasses, raisin, and plum. Bold, yet giving way to a smoothness of caramel, roasties of fruit skins, and a smokey alluring finish of twisted dark toffee and some weird root beer like spice. Vanilla and chocolate notes along with some peat and tarry tobacco-like flavors meld into a pudding of warmth as it soaks up the soft corpuscles of the palate leaving a smoothly manufactured fullness in the mouth.

Feel is slowly medium and quite dark with a dullish tang that hangs around for length as it gets all complex and fun with the flavors. Seems a bit thin at the front but builds and then lasts for one stretched out volume of mouth coating warmth and smooth oilyness.

A long lasting sipper that dawns its own grace in acceptance for flavor, body, and warmth.
Quite a nice brew.

The aroma is clean, earthy, with hints of both fruit and green vegetables.  The taste is sweet, a bit astringent and spicy, with too many flavors to try to separate.  There are hints of grape peel, dirt, cloves, and cocoa/chocolate.  Its a very pleasant blend with only a little bitterness.  It reminds me somewhat of the wild grape vines I used to find as a child, how fruity and astringent they were.  I would think this was more than 8 percent alcohol, and not because of the strength but more because of the cooling and drying effects.  The body is medium, with a spicy finish.  Im not sure I like this as much as some of the reviewers seem to, but it IS different in a good way and I will buy it again if I can find it!","Sherman, Texas, USA","unixweb"

At first, it seems rather bland in the mouth, as well, but theres a subtlety to it that takes a bit to notice.  Fruity and subtle spices as well as a dark chocolate that provides a great foundation.  It has a strange astringency, almost like a dry gin.  Around mid bottle, the fruit start to organize themselves ... dark fruit mostly, and blueberry was the most noticeable, but I also got a sense of cherry.

I think this would be very good if it didnt taste flat.  I guess I prefer to have carbonation in a beer.  It would have balanced the extreme sweetness in this one.

The ingredients and the flavors flow along the tongue quite nicely.  This beer could be obscene as far as too much flavor, but it levels off before anything too weird happens.  This is a good thing.

530,"2006-01-09",2.2,"UPDATED: FEB 16, 2006 Wow, talk about being sorely disappointed in a beer... With a percentile score of 99 Id had high hopes for it.

Will try to find another and give it a second chance... 

UPDATE 2/10/06: Ok, tried another bottle of this last night and though better than the first one it was still (IMO) nothing to get excited about. This bottle had a little more carbonation than the first but I was still unable to get any kind of head from it (Oooh... that sounded bad). Also there was a terrible sour taste that permeated my mouth about 3/4 through the glass..

Beer pours a murky, nearly opaque dark-ash brown with a large, mostly lasting, off-white head. The beer is quite aromatic: The coriander is heavy and backed with moderate malty notes of chocolate, molasses and lightly smokey peat. Theres a yeasty note of fresh-baked bread, a light note of cellar and neat miscellaneous notes of cola and redwood. The flavor starts off moderately sweet and ends with a gentle flip into a lightly bitter finish that terminates with a touch of sourness.

530,"2005-12-30",3.9,"A small, tan head is creamy over a deeply cola-colored base. A resounding alcohol presence initially hides any flavorful aspects of the beer, including the coriander and citrus. A revelation of diversity occurs later as the aroma opens up to the aforementioned as well as whisky, pear and caramel. Flavor is slightly sweet, in the way that a whisky can have sweet, rounded edges. Potency prevails but fruitiness definitely competes. Malted qualities really come out as it warms. A syrupy start dissapears in astringency, producing a thinner mouthfeel than at first perceived. Aftertaste is lightly spiced but is mainly only esters.

Im not overly familiar with the flavor of coriander, so I cant comment intelligently on whether or not coriander is evident in this brew.

Mouthfeel: thin and lightly carbonated.

Goes down almost like wine with very littly carbonation and zero hop presence. Most of the action is in the malt and coriander flavoring. The malt increases as the swallow finishes and this is what offsets the mildly cloying sweetness, thereby giving the beer its backbone. The initial taste almost feels like flavored soda water.

Mouthfeel is equally impressive, all chunky and warm. Finish is as good as anything I can think of and lasts for days!.

This one reminded me quite a bit of Lake Louies Warped Speed, yet without some of the more positive characteristics of WS. Perhaps its the coriander Im objecting to, although in general it seemed this lacked the depth of some of the other Scotchs. On the palate, brown sugar and caramel and date.

The aroma is a mix of earthy spice notes and rich concentrated fruit notes.  I get aromatic notes of fig, prunes, dried cranberries, raisins, coriander, and cherry liquor.  The aroma is quite nice and rich, and quite intrigueing, I am definitely spending quite a bit of time just smelling the wonderful aroma on this beer.  The beer is only lightly sweet, but still finishes with the rich fruity notes that were found in the nose.  The finish also has that earthy spice note of coriander.  The taste does not quite live up to the wonderful aroma, but it is still quite satisfying.  I get notes of prunes, raisins, and figs.  This beer is quite good, though I would certainly wish that the flavor was as rich and intrigueing as the aroma.

Aroma is molasses, grassey, stable yard, corriander and bready, all in 1 swoop.
Taste is stupidly complex, gettin on a good rochefort 10 for complexness. Alcohol is very well hidden aswel, but i just find the bitter sweetness of the dark chocolate taste overpowering and hard to finish.

Also present is some milk chocolate, cocoa, some molasses and anise.  Nice and sweet and malty with a little bitterness.  A bit of a warming sensation at the end.

530,"2005-03-31",3.2,"The simple black and white label in classic old fashioned woodcut style speaks of an era, long gone. Im preparing for a new horizon in beer, pairing my (current) favorite style Scotch Ale, with the musky enjoyable coriander. This lady pours deep and dark, with that lovely ruby glint in the corner of the glass. Held to the light, its more off a blood red glow, with a fastly diminishing head riding shotgun. My nose fails to detect much of a beamingly distinct aroma. Faintly wafting up my nostrils is a puckery stale malt. This beer has coriander in it? Maybe its not supposed to overshadow the rich tones of the malt, but this beer is really stretching to have coriander in its register. Im mostly detecting it as it smacks on a my palate, a little of that musty spice aftertaste. Sourness prevails right away, smoothing out into a slightly bitter toasted coating. Butter. Its there. This is a quality that I think Ive found in beers that have a high alcohol content, but have seen too much time on a store shelf. It goes along with a meaty quality described in some aged beers. That coriander is coming out a little more now, as a venerable limey hint on my tounge. Im just noticing the stillness of this beer. I wish I could say better things, but this beer doesnt light my fire. Maybe it saw too much florescent light.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Perhaps there is some mintiness as well.  This thing has a very unique and wonderful aroma.  Moderately opaque mahogany color with a small light tan head.  Wow, this is a very different beer.  Mild hints of lemony coriander, turning chocolatey/coffee-ish with nice thick roasted notes.  Finishes late late with a smoked roastiness and mild chocolates.  The coriander also lingers on and on.

Different aroma from anything else Ive ever encountered, sort of a molasses, spice, vegetal thing that I couldnt quite get my head around, including an alcohol note.

Flavor is sweet malt, with the spices flocking to the roof of the mouth.  A slightly smoky roastedness predominates the finish.  Tastes very close to a scotch ale with the addition of unique spices.  There is a slight alcoholic twinge in the flavor as well.  Very unique and refreshing.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

Smells like... chocolate, and some other things. The taste is of chocolate, oranges, and a hint of lemon. Basically, this tasted like liquid jaffa cakes. Which is great in my opinion.

Coriander boosted caramel pudding on the top of a decadent chocolate flavored cake. Out of this world complexity with nutmeg, ginger and vanilla complications. A dark fruitiness is involved, very mild in the back of all that terrific malt, its plummy, raisiny. First sip hits me with an unexpected round mouthfeel, gentle carbonation, fully sensuous. Big molasses and licorice flavors, chocolatey, fruity, spicy, so complex you know youre missing half the flavors. Mild alcohol suggestion reminds you to slow down the sipping effortless effort. Wow this was great, maybe even better than expected, a wonderful dessert sipper with a nose that is nothing short of sinful and creates a dependance.

Sweetish, very licoricey and dried-fruity, roasted-malty flavor with relatively low bitterness, but a dryish finish. Medium to full-bodied, slicky-sticky and slightly thin, very low-carbonated palate. An interesting ale - something like Rochefort 8 with some added malt and without the yeast and carbonation.

Oh wow do I like when super-hyped beers deliver.  The best part is the body, I keep waiting for it to peter out and it just stays and the flavor keeps coming.  Lots of coriander but it is balanced supremely with hops and a good spicy malt.  Complexity entails a nice subtle smoked peat, some lighter sweet cherries.  Finish is delightful, flavor climaxes into spice, fruity malt and a wonderful even hops.  Full bodied, no carbonation problems.  no alcohol apparent. Worthy of its spot and more. Maybe just a touch too much coriander on the finish, slight astringency problems. nothing major.  Still wish they wouldnt filter these beers.

The aftertaste is dry with a slight mouth-puckering effect.  This beer is pretty complex and different, but it's just not that great.

Very complex flavors, sweet malt flavors with slight licorice, cola, and other distinct flavors that I assume was the coriander.

Aroma was disappointing ... smelled musty.  Rich malty chocolate tones with powerful anise base.  Coriander flavor is barely perceptible.  Nice overall spiciness from hops.

530,"2002-07-04",4.2,"This beer poured out a very black color that appeared dark ruby when held up. Was no head on this one, maybe due again to temperature served.

Maybe on certain occasions.","Ohio, USA","Gunshy"
530,"2002-06-28",4.7,"Bottle (1995 edition).  Few things smell as nice as this beer.  It springs to life with each sip and rises in itensity and complexity leaving an aftertaste as fine as the aroma.  This beer seems to work on three levels.  First, it has the rich malty, mollasses, smoke, and deep flavors.  Second, the deep fruit flavor takes over with plums, apples, and wine-like grapes.  Then the spices take it home with licorice, coriander, and ginger among others.    Unlike some of the great Beligan beers which may have more complexity but would be hard to drink all day or in large quantities, the Jacobite has such a solid foundation and is so well balanced that it would be hard to imagine it ever overwhelming and dulling the senses.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"

530,"2002-06-13",4.4,"Immediately after opening the bottle I smelled what I would swear was Froot Loops or Trix (I assume that is the corriander). 1995 edition (through June 2009). Poured a lovely burnt sienna (I have the Crayola to prove it) color with a lively short lived head and lacing. Berries, licorice, and slight alcohol flavor pervade. Almost $5 a bottle here in Ohio but this was worth experiencing and I will get it again for sure.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
530,"2002-06-12",4.8,"Spectacular.  Gorgeous appearance.  The aroma changed nicely as it warmed; the spiciness came through most when cold, then supplanted by chocolate richness--like my wifes fresh-baked bitter chocolate brownies.  Filled my mouth with double cream-like richness and stickiness.  Nice flavors, only a lighter presence of alcohol.  Not for drinking in quantity, as much as because of the sweetness as the alcohol.  I love sweet drinks (like port) so no problem here!","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
530,"2002-06-09",4.3,"This beer poured with an easy and fluffy light-tan head. The body looked black until it is held up to a light where it becomes a dark ruby. The aroma and flavor make this a very interesting beer. The coriander mixed with the very rich, dark malt backbone of this beer made for a very interesting aroma. It reminded me of chocolate covered cherries (the cream kind, not the clear liquid centers) despite the fact that the beer has no cherries in its ingredients. The flavor lacks the cherry notes (although I burped and tasted the chocolate covered cherries). Instead you get a rich toffee and chocolate maltiness with some mild notes of the coriander giving it an interesting taste of something like a bastard child of scotch ale and Belgian abbey ale. There is some bitterness, especially in the finish as the beer warms, but it seems to come from the dark malts as much as from any hops (which were buried under the onslaught of the aromas and flavors of the other ingredients.) The mouth feel if full with a slight cheesiness but not too syrupy. The heaviness of this beer makes it difficult to drink in large quantities or fast, but youll be satisfied after one and will want to savor it anyway.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

Very full mouthfeel, and very soft, wonderful to drink.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
530,"2002-05-22",4.1,"Very complex beer. Nose is of licorice, plums, pumpkin pie spices. Flavor leans toward molasses, but theres plenty of spiciness and a good dose of finishing bitterness to counter the sweetness. A study in balance.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"

530,"2002-05-13",3.1,"UPDATED: NOV 21, 2009 Bottle, BB June 2017.  Head is initially small, frothy, light brown, mostly diminishing.
Body is dark reddish-brown. Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, milk chocolate), with a strong note of coriander and lesser notes of
licorice, cherry, blackberry. Flavor is
moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is
lightly sweet, moderately acidic, moderately to heavily bitter. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.  In the nose, imagine a caramelly, less bright form of Tripel Karmeliet...lots of coriander.  Kind of stark in the mouth; not a lot of malt sweetness or texture to balance the acidity and spice bitterness.  Not bad, but not very impressive either.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
530,"2002-05-06",3.9,"Lots of black licorice aroma from a dark brown and almost headless ale. The alcohol was the first thing I noticed. The taste then shifted to sweet tooffee-ish  then to black licorice (or whatever flavor  GoodnPlentys are) and finishes where it started...strong alcohol on the tongue. Very interesting, maybe best as a dessert beer, but the little bottle is a bit steep in price. I think Ill get another to stow away for a later date.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"

Coriander is a medicinal tonic for the stomach, so this is the brew that cures all ails? Like the House Ale, a rich, reddish-brown color, little to no head, I felt this was softer, much more mellow than the House Ale, a milder malt flavor that initially kept disappearing on the palate, but becomes much more drinkable as it opens up and in much larger quantities, a stiff drink any way you look at it, but a true tavern drink, unlike the House Ale which is strictly for sipping, this is a wonderful complement to almost any kind of food.","Evanston, Illinois, USA","cranesareflying"

The corriander is immediately apparent in the nose along with cookie dough, bread, milk chocolate and bitter chocolate.  The flavor is very similar to a dubbel with dark chocolate, and cookie dough predominate in the beginning and eventually giving way to the spices.  The beer finishes spicy and slighty bitter.  This is not a hop bitterness, but rather a bitterness imparted by the spices.  Deep brown, nearly opaque color with a medium sized off-white head.  A unique and masterful creation that improves as it warms.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

The malt is dark, powerful and rich, some light alcohol flavors, fruit and molasses as well as some milk chocolate. The head falls into an oily surface of arabesques. The coriander spice as well as the bitter component are on the playbill but in cameo roles - the nose and flavor hold a bit of coriander and the finish is a mild bitter.  Although I dont believe there is any added anise, the flavor is a definite component of the finish and may divide drinkers among the love/hate line of licorice.

Color is *dark* ruby red with a big frothy head; the aroma is that of a extra malty, sweet Belgian Wit.  Initial flavor is rich and sweet, but not sticky.  Proceeding that, things get complex, but in the most wonderful sense.  The aftertaste begs you to take another sip, but not before savoring the previous one fully.
