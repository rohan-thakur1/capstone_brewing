388,"2013-05-03",2.8,"Year old(?) pull tab can off the shelf at Liquor World in Cambridge.  Baby chalice. 
Clear, with a slighty yellow/straw tint.

Dried pineapple, rose water, plastic candy, Play-Doh. Im anticipating something creamy.

Initial draw is sweet like flat Seven Up, quickly fusing with a melon-y/minty herbal liqueur of sorts. Hydrogen Peroxide. It finishes with a dry & itchy grass-like bitterness.

Consistency is a bit thick(nearly chewy), & feels a bit stronger then the listed 19%. Though it was cold enough that it didnt quite burn till it got all the way down.

Still trying to get my legs steady while rating sake.","FT: Stale Polotmavý in Queens, New York, USA","MicroGrog"
388,"2012-06-29",3.1,"Wow, you can smell the brewers alcohol immediately. This actually has a bit going for it - soft, mellow though forceful fruity flavours, but the alcohol kick is just too much to really enjoy. More well put together than one would imagine for a can of sake bought for under 300 Yen.","JAPAN","jonno"
388,"2012-03-06",3.4,"200mL. Green, planty nose, with classic light sulfur and fruit. This almost rings with a little chlorophyll. This is much sweeter than I expected. Interesting. This is somewhere between a clear distillate and some rough around the edges soju, with glimmering hints of refinement in the middle. The sweetness adds a distinct starchy body to the beer, leaving more flavor on the palate in the finish. Warming. Not bad. My limited experience with Honjozo suggests this isnt the best, but it is from a can and it wasnt $67, so Ill take it.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Immediate aroma of fruity rice, mead, a good amount of fusel, a touch of earthy cedar, tiny mushrooms, but mostly rice.  Sweet flavor, fruit esters from yeast, rich rice kernel.  Very smooth, easy to consume.  Hard to believe it is so strong. I should go slow, even though it is so cold outside.  Super H-Mart; Duluth, Ga; $7.99
