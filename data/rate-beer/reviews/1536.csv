1536,"2017-06-21",3.4,"Taste: Crisp, dry cracker wheat notes with citrus hops and orange peel. Same with the nose. Gold, slight haze, with a white head and some lace. Medium body. Balanced, and a good thirst quencher on a hot day.","Darien, Illinois, USA","BlackBeerPG"
1536,"2017-06-21",3.8,"Can from Sake no Taniguchi. Pours a hazy yellow gold, finger of white foam, suspended particles. Nice fresh citrus and pineapple aroma, wheat and grass with a crackery malt. Fruity flavour, plenty of citrus and lightly tropical. Great wheat and malt base. Starts spritzy but has a rounded smooth feel that glides down the palate. Rising bitterness in the backend with a little pine note, but it cleans out soon after swallowing, tempting you for the next mouthful. Totally crushable in the heat.","Osaka, JAPAN","mrjez"
1536,"2017-06-16",2.8,"Clear gold, tight lace. 
Medium body and flavor, neutral and clean mouthfeel, good carbonation but low heat, average aftertaste. 
Moderately crisp, dry and bitter.
Hoppy. 
Ok but not a typical wheat beer.

1536,"2017-06-03",3.7,"Cue Harry Belafonte's ""Jump in the Line"" and break out the limbo pole, if you are so inclined, because Sun Crusher comes with a punch bowl of tropical flavors.

A hopped up wheat ale results in a hazy, yellow/gold pour and nice head. You can also smell the wheat, but pronounced are orange and grapefruit. More subtle are lemon, grass, and maybe even a whiff of pineapple, mango, and apricot. 

Not much carbonation here, and you get hit with the tropical citrus as you sip. Some bitterness follows. The finish is very, very dry and crisp, almost chalky, and yet bright.

One last point: Break out your Hawaiian shirt when drinking a Sun Crusher because it's that awesome!

1536,"2017-06-02",3.8,"Nice tropical fruit aroma, pours a hazy yellow with a thin white head. Slight note of sweetness to start with, then it goes to a clean citrus hop note, and a mild bitterness in the finish. Light bodied, with a full mouthfeel.

1536,"2017-05-23",3.9,"First time Ive had this. Picked up a sixer at Binnys and talked with my guy over there about this one. Apparently, it was designed by the same guy who designed Gumballhead for 3Fs (??). I havent looked it up yet to see if anyone can corroborate the account, but I drank like all six of em on Saturday night after work. While eating a stack of tacos and watching Mad Men and thoroughly high on some Dutch Treat (look it up on Leafly if you wanna know as I only do beer reviews here). All I know is, it sure tasted a whole lot like Gumballhead... and I didnt have to pay Nick Floyd a fuckin dime. Which makes me happy.","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"
1536,"2017-05-22",3.9,"This is a pretty decent APA or maybe session IPA type beer. Its orange and a bit cloudy w/ a foamy head. Its got a soft, fruity citrus nose w/ an herbal underpinning and maybe some mint or something. This is dry but still has a nice full mouthfeel. I will chalk this up to the wheat and fine carbonation. It finishes crisply w/ a good dose of bitterness. This one has something I cant put my finger on. The hop character isnt strikingly good or anything but something about it is just really drinkable and enjoyable.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
1536,"2017-05-22",3.5,"12 oz can from Chris R. Pours a clear golden color with a medium sized off white head. The aroma and flavor have pale wheat malts, a nice hop profile for a wheat beer, citrus, floral, grass, almost in the session IPA category.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"

The citrus and fruit notes of the hops are most prominent, with some nice spicy dankness from the crystal. The flavor is very hop forward as well, with some pretty neutral malt and a nice smooth character from the oats and perhaps the wheat too. The bitterness in pretty in check. Pretty tasty stuff if you like hops and good beer.","Joliet, Illinois, USA","monkeychugg55"
1536,"2017-05-01",3.8,"12oz bottle. Americans Wheats are an odd creature, and probably not an easy one to understand from a newb perspective. This one is a lot hoppier than a traditional one of course, employing some new school hop varietals. The Red Wheat fleshes it out some and gives it some depth.

The flavor presents moderate bitterness, citrus hops, tropical fruit, wheat, lemony, spicy, grapefruit, herbal, and some malt. The mouthfeel is crisp and moderate carbonation. This beer is light-medium bodied. This beer has a bitter and dry finish. The taste is just so-so for me and this is not one of the better beers from this brewery that I have drank/rated.

The taste is dry, slightly bitter, and with the faintest sweet touch. I get a good amount of both wheat and orange, while pine, caramel, floral hops, and cereal are all pretty subdued. Short and sharp bitter wheat aftertaste. This is medium in body, with a crisp texture, and average in carbonation. I found this to be pretty refreshing.

Pours lightly hazy/cloudy pale golden/yellow color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, peach, apricot, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, peach, apricot, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, light pepper/pine, wheat, cracker, light honey, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/citrus peel/grassy/spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, peach, apricot, pineapple, passion fruit, papaya, mango, lemon/orange peel, pepper, pine, wheat, cracker, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from lingering bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, and creamy/grainy/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.3%. Overall this is a very nice hoppy wheat ale. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical hops and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the balanced bitterness. Tastes more like a standard American pale ale than a wheat beer; but I expected it given the brewery. Bright/juicy hops with balanced malt flavors. A really delicious offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
1536,"2017-04-21",3.2,"355ml can. This seems a replacement to that other hoppy wheat with that creepy fat fuck on the can art. It is thankfully lower in alcohol. Pours a hazy gold. Aroma is tropical fruity, pineapple. Flavor is peppery as in bell pepper, but not offensive, banana peppper or de-heated habanero. Some lemon, herbs, flowers, grass. It is a bit to heavy in wheat to be called a crusher but its decent.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
