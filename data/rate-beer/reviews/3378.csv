3378,"2013-11-03",4.0,"On tap at brewery, poured a goldish color with aromas of tropical fruit, light pineapple, and some malt. Flavors are a tropical hop head paridise where a slight malt flavor comes through. This beer is way too crushable and the hop mix is just enough where it doesnt ruin your palate and you begin to thirst for more of it after each sip. A solid beer in this series.","Florida, USA","burg326"

3378,"2013-07-21",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2013 Tap at proof. Clear straw yellow with fluffy white head. Big citrus and floral hop aroma. Grainy with lots of floral bitterness. Reminds me a lot of like a light ballast point sculpin. Dry Hoppy flavorful and low in alcohol. I hope they make more of this!","Sarasota, Florida, USA","stevencon"

3378,"2013-07-01",4.5,"Cigar City Seans Hoppy Session Ale is a an easy drinking pale with a nice bit if uniqueness. Aroma is peppery with a bit of floral. Pour is amber clear with a lasting head. A pleasant peppery (but not hot) hop flavor dominates the flavor but doesnt last as long on the palate as I would like. It works, though, because the sessionable quality makes it easy drinking. Seans Hoppy Session Ale is another well-executed beer from CCB.","Orlando, Florida, USA","sloshgator"

3378,"2013-06-25",3.8,"These Torcedores Series brews are just getting better and better. It smelled pretty damn close to a Christmas tree. The body wasnt as pine-filled as the aroma, but rather full of grapefruit, grassy hops and a nice tangerine finish. Loving this one!","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"
