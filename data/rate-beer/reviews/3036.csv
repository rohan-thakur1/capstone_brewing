Pours deep caramel brown with a very thin light brown head that has no retention or lacing. Starts with rich booze soaked dark fruit flavors with nice notes of vanilla and bourbon that also has a rich, full body and nice smooth mouthfeel. Finishes smooth and boozy with delightful caramel and toffee flavors with a bit of oak and warming alcohol. A nice winter beer, but so good I wouldnt mind it anytime!","","zoucrew102"

3036,"2017-04-09",4.2,"Bottle, 2015 vintage held in the cellar for just about one year. Dark brown pour with a finger of creamy tan head. Powerful aroma centered around the barrel treatment; bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and hints of hops. The flavor is truly terrific and one of the best barreled barley wines I can recall to date lots of barrel influence without being overly hot or too firm in center stage. Big bourbon sweetness, vanilla, caramel, dark fruits, a little wood, and just enough hops. Ive heard that this can be pretty hot when fresh; I can only attest to a bottle with a year of age on it; fantastic stuff.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"

3036,"2016-12-13",4.2,"2016 bottle purchased at The Davis Beer Shoppe. The aroma is essentially dominated by sweetness, vanilla, and bourbon. There might be a touch of caramel present. I dont really smell the base beer in any way. The beer itself has a brownish-yellow head that is fairly strong, and a mahogany, slightly transparent body. If I didnt know any better, Id say this is a BA Impy Stout at this point. Starts with a sweet, sugary, sticky, caramel and toffee flavoring. A little buttery diacetyl is also present, but I think thats ok in a big English Barleywine. The middle has a little bit of bourbon and vanilla flavors, but the bourbon is surprisingly not over-done flavor-wise. This finishes with some leather and tobacco. Its a bit warming, and the ethanol is surprisingly well-hidden. The mouthfeel on this is just the right balance of carbonation to make this dangerously drinkable. This is decadent, and a little on the sweet side. Definitely something I would enjoy drinking 8oz of, but 22oz is going to be tough to drink solo.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

This is a beer, when consumed alone, brings you into the land of ""Who Gives a Shit?"". The texture is rich, and slick. Quite honestly, Ive quite had it with the barrel-aged trend, but Pelican has been brewing this beer prior to that trend, and theyre doing a damn good job with it.

3036,"2016-01-28",3.9,"This is review of 2013 vintage. Bottle is around 2 1/4 years old at this point. 

Pours an extremely dark brown, looks closer to an imperial stout than a barleywine. Head is very thin and mocha colored. Head retention was non existent and neither was lacing. 

Smell is big on caramel, burnt sugar, brandy soaked figs, vanilla, and oak. Bourbon is slightly present but blends nicely. No hops apparent, this is a malt bomb. 

Taste is very sweet and somewhat dry. Burnt caramel, bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and slight oxidation are main flavors detected. As beer warms Im getting big hits of dried fruit, prune, fig, and dates. That along with some warming alcohol gives the beer a false sense of being aged in cognac barrels rather than bourbon. Maybe the prolonged aging is to blame for that. Hops are nowhere to be found, sweet malt and alcohol is the name of the game here. 

Mouthfeel is oily, dense, and somewhat undercarbonated. Alcohol is slightly astringent, head was never a factor unfortunately. 

Overall, beer was good, solid representation of the style. Just wish there was more head and a bit more carbonation. Maybe 2 years in the bottle have diminished some of the qualities that were present in 2014 when I had this beer at Gabf","Colorado, USA","Angelmonster"

Pours a deep dark brown with one finger of tan foam that reduces after a minute. Taste is sweet and savory with all aroma deScriptors represented in flavor. I really dig the cheesiness. Kind of a curveball there. Body is full, mouthfeel damn near chewy. As good of a barrel-aged beer as Ive ever had I think, rivaling Firestone Walkers Anniversary beers.

3036,"2015-12-28",4.2,"2014 bottle. Thanks Roger.
This was poured into a tulip, why, well, because I broke one of my snifters today and Im an asshole.
Heres the rest;
The appearance was a black color with a slim finger-ed filmy head that quickly dissipated to leave barely nothing for lacing.
The aroma makes up for lack of show in the aroma to allow a stellar amount of sweet caramel, light toffee, subtle tobacco, eloquent vanilla, sweet boozy/alcohol (almost bourbon-esque sort of underlying aroma).
The taste enables a sweet to glossy slide of the malts just riding all along my tongue in a sticky sort of sweet fashion. Definitely a sweet sticky aftertaste of the malts running into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body as its a good sipper. Carbonation runs extremely light but Im assuming thats because of the age of the bottle, so no worries.
Overall, English Barleywine, oh hell yeah! Definitely fits the style and am extremely glad I finally got to try this.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Sweet caramel, toasted brown sugar, molasses, heavy bourbon, woody oak, vanilla, candied & honey-drizzled dark fruits; prunes, figs, dates... This thing is a beast. The flavor is no different. The boozy warmth is amplified. Huge flavors of bourbon-soaked raisins, dates, plums, dipped in molasses & rolled in a charred brown sugar bath. Huge back-end flavors of wood, vanilla, faint char, & a little bit of cocoa dust. Malty sweet finish with lots of caramel & toffee, all whilst showing that big underbelly of bourbon. Syrupy, thick body. Great barleywine.
Bottle: 2013 vintage, relatively fresh. Delicious, tons of super sweet caramel, butter toffee, molasses, brown sugar, & dark fruit, cut perfectly with warm barrel tannins, oak, & soothing bourbon. Great beer as always, & lovely fresh. Maybe the best bottle Ive had.
Bottle: 2012 vintage, a little over two years old. Even with two years, the bourbon is a heavy hitter, full-force warmonger. Ive never had an issue with the booziness of MoAS, though, because it balances so well with the offsetting malty bomb sweetness. Honestly, aged isnt too much different from fresh. Delicious either way.
Bottle: 2010 vintage, about three years old or so. Thanks, Mike. Surprised that this one showed a minor bit of oxidation with a touch of papery staleness in the finish.

Pours a dark mohagony, ember red color, with a fizzy, small head, leaving back a thin alcohol legged lacing.

Complex aromas of toffeeish malts, syrup, molasses, getting wrapped up by wooden, slightly vanilla, hot Bourbon. Despite the barrel burn, the nose evokes a very sweet character, which gets topped by a sweet coca-cola like impression. Involves a note of slightly bitter coffee and bakers chocolate, inseparably blending into fudge and molasses. Although there is a prevailung sweetness, which I would usually pretty much diskike, the nose convinces by all its finely graduated nuances, and the very well developed, complex Bourbon barrel, easily balancing the toffee sweetness.

Tastes of bready, toffeeish, slightly creamy malts, with a very clean mouthfeel to it, until the Bourbon enters the scene, bringing a wooden, slightly dry alcohol bite with it, as well as a vanilla note, mingling with molasses, nougat and stale, oakie coffee. The boozy Bourbon bite is teeth numbing dominant, while getting toned down by glazed toffee and honey, building up a great balance between wooden booziness and caramelized sweetness. Due to the surprisingly convenient balance, there are many subtle flavors detectable, such as an acrid coffee tang, resulting from the rich Bourbon, paired against toasty, glazed vanilla, getting accompanied by hazelnuts. Has a hot dryness to it during the finish, enveloping the dried fruits, sweet malts, with molasses providing a long lasting aftertaste among the leathery, wooden Bourbon.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, molasses, toffee, toast, brown bread, raisin, prune, fig, date, bourbon, oak, leather, tobacco, light vanilla, light chocolate, and oak/toasted earthiness. Slight oaky bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, molasses, brown bread, raisin, prune, fig, date, bourbon, oak, leather, tobacco, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Outstanding complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel flavors; with zero cloying sweetness present after the finish. Light carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, fairly slick, and lightly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with a small-moderate warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged English barelywine style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and oak barrel flavors; and fairly smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering, but I feel that the base beer is more impressive than this one.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

There doesnt seem to be an excess of bourbon notes, but a general booziness that could detract from the other flavors. A bit too sweet. Quite honestly, I could see this being a much more interesting beer after 5 years, the oxidation will hopefully add some depth to the flavor, tame the booziness (which is not over the top by any means) and unaccentuate the sweetness.

3036,"2012-12-08",5.0,"At last, a barleywine I prefer even over Olde Curmudgeon!
2012 Bottling
Incredibly complex nose and flavor of caramel, toffee, bourbon (lots of it), sherry, cognac,  vanilla, oak, raisins, honey, kumquats, orange zest, persimmons, plums, peaches, strawberries, prunes, dates, figs, cherries, pecan pralines, rhubarb, toasted coconut, leather, tobacco, and a hint of smokiness.

The body is syrupy, but playfully so, not sticky or cloying. This beauty has legs like Angelina, and the mouth becomes delightfully coated as the sipping continues. The finish is one of the longest Ive ever experienced, and the woodiness and the alcohol prevent this one from becoming too sweet (as a gentleman before me pointed out).

Its been quite a few years since I was an ardent fan of the barleywine style, but this one absolutely blew me away, even fresh. I can only imagine what a few years of aging might achieve.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Caskalefan"
3036,"2012-12-07",4.0,"Pours a deep, reddish brown, with a moderate, lose, disappearing head. Aroma is sweet malt, primarily, with some subtle notes of toffee, carmel, raisin and vanilla. Aroma is bit too heavy on the malt, but Im being picky, because this is a pricey beer. I do not get more than, maybe, a hint of bourbon or oak in the aroma. The taste is dominantly sweet malt, brown sugar, substantial alcohol component, and really just hints of toffee, bourbon and oak. The mouthfeel is smooth and the carbonation is moderate. I find this beer to be enjoyable, but given the ABV and the barrel aging, I would have expected more complexity and depth. So, while Im happy to have tried it, it will probably be a while before I come back to it. As for aging, my concern is that it will lose some of the complexity it has, which for me would not be a plus.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"

3036,"2012-02-16",4.6,"Bottle, generously traded by Savvy1982 and shared with Parksy and Gripp. Pours a lustrous deep chocolate brown with a dense, finely bubbled golden brown head. Aroma is rich and full of promise: caramel, chocolate, vanilla, and hops, but more than that, evoking creme brûlée, and date cake with bourbon sauce and creme fresh. Beautiful flavour structure, high intensity, thick and chewy; sponge toffee, burnt marshmallow, chocolate, oaky vanilla, dates, ill-defined spices or perhaps just the suggestion thereof, and an assertive bitterness that has coniferous and citrus pith qualities. This beer is enormous, but carries itself elegantly. For me this was close to perfection in its balance, flavour profile, and its adept use of barrel aging to compliment the underlying beer. Im probably in the minority amongst Ratebeerians in that I am not tired of barrel aging beers, and this brew is an example of why-- when done well, it can elevate the end product to become something extraordinary. I know the product monograph describes this as an English style BW, but to me it exemplifies the best in American craftsmanship, taking every component of an established style, elevating them and combining them in such a way as to give new life and fresh awareness to an old favourite. Exquisite.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

3036,"2012-02-08",3.0,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2012 I remember this being much better in 2009.   Usually when its been 2-3 years between tastes, and my impressions of the two are so different, I chalk it up to a combination of changing taste and worsened brewing (pretty common with the amount of expansion going on these days).  this time, however, I remember the Perfect Storm from 2009 as vividly as if I had had it yesterday.  so I can say this with more confidence than I normally have: 2011 is off, in a big way.  so big, I struggle reading through recent comments.  so its caramel-heavy and boozy, its always been like that, and always worked well as what it is, but this batch is off.  the lactic acid is so bad, its basically like curdled milk in a baileys and irish whiskey drink with a small touch of reduced raisin sugar syrup.   to go with this unnecessarily strong acidity is a spice cabinet and nesquick powder character thats completely off-putting.  rather than being complex its just complicated, and though I stop short of calling it a mess, and can see what it should be, and what it once was, this release is so acidic, metallic, bloody AND boozy, I honestly cant believe the brewers let this one out without knowing it had turned.  sadly, heres my 2009 rating, summed up: ""soft peppermint, forward and boozy alcohol,  hot, brash, rich, decadent, chewy, maple syrup, cake-like caramel malt, sweetened vanilla extract"".","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3036,"2012-02-03",4.5,"2009 Bottle Reviewed 2010 - The Perfect Storm pours a deep opaque amber.  At first a slight bit of head was poured but quickly became what you see in the picture.  No lacing, no head.  A flat beer.  Which for this kind of beer is just fine with me.  The smell on this beer just blew me away.  I sat there for a good 5 minutes just smelling this beer.  If you love bourbon, well then youre in luck.  It blasts the nose and is the biggest smell youll get from this beer.  I havent had a beer with some much bourbon or oak in the nose.  Just fantastic.  While the bourbon is the star by far, other fantastic aromas attack the nostrils.  Vanilla, toffee, caramel, and dark fruits.  It gives a very sweet aroma mixed in their with the bourbon.  Like I said above its very hard explaining just how fantastic and complex the smell is. 

Sometimes the smell of a beer is more impressive then its taste.  Not here folks.  Its on par with the smell.  Friggin fantastic.  Once again the bourbon is just up front and kicking you in the teeth.  Only beer I can think of that comes close to having this amount of bourbon might be Bourbon aged Angels Share but not even that really holds a candle to the amount in this beer.  Some of you might think that its a bad thing and that the bourbon might get in the way of everything else.  Nope.   Because while the bourbon is really big (and damn tasty I might add) everything else is big and mixes in their perfect.  The caramel and toffee add a really nice backbone to the beer.  Mixed in with the dark fruity flavor its just amazing.  I also picked up a little bit of vanilla and chocolate in the aftertaste.  So much going on. 

Last but not least, the mouthfeel.  Its just as amazing as the taste and smell.  Full bodied.  No carbonation.  Syrupy and sticky.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","drunkenpolack"

A - Half finger head which goes away quickly. Amber / Brown is what Id describe the color. Looks like a fine whiskey or bourbon with some carbonation thrown in there. 
S - You can smell this thing from 6 feet away. The smell is strong and overtakes you. Im getting Brown sugar, caramel and cinnamon.
T - Bourbon with a lot of sugar. TONS of alcohol and astringent notes.
M - Its a very lingering beer. If you like the taste, good but if you dont, this beer sticks with you for a while and comes back for more even after youve had some water.
O - I wanted to love this beer. The high ABV is great but in a bottle so large, you have to share it with friends. Id like to see how this beer holds up after another year or two.

3036,"2011-09-06",4.4,"Review is from notes.  This bottle was graciously shared at DLD by some top notch BAs. Ive been looking for a world class bourbon barrel aged barleywine for some time now. It was probably my favorite beer of the day. It poured a dark brown/amberish color with a light off white head. It instantly smelled of oak, bourbon, vanilla, carmel malts, and alcohol. It made the hair on my neck stand up. I instantly knew that I was in for a treat! The flavors were a nice blend of woody earthiness, vanilla, molasses, Evan Williams, and slight roasted malts. The complexities of this one are something I havent seen from a barleywine yet. It drank very easily and smooth for the high alcohol content. My only complaint is that I only got a four ounce pour and it disappeared too quickly. Massive thanks to those BAs who shared this on Saturday! You forever etched this memory in my mind! Cant wait to see you guys next year!","Fishers, Indiana, USA","aasher"

A: Deep rudy-brown body. Bordeaux like on the edges when held to the light. Lively carbonation forms a fizzy, coca-cola like khaki head. Rises to about an inch before crashing rapidly. No lacing to speak of.

S: Rich bourbon, soft oak, warm caramel, sweet vanilla, roasted brown sugar, molasses and hints of raisin. There are lots of elements coming together here in harmony. Sweet, yet not cloying or desert like.

T: The sweet caramel, brown sugar and molasses dominates. Accentuated by substantial, yet not overwhelming, bourbon. The barrels imparts a nice delicate oak/vanilla character.

In long: Nose is very very very bourbon barrel.  Taste is barrels, lots of vanilla, dark fruits, caramel, maple, sticky barley candy, oily nuts, nougat, burnt brown sugar, more...  There is a level of complexity that I cannot put into words.  A little booze but overall the alcohol is well hidden for a 13% beer.  The dominant flavors here are the barrels.  In a blind tasting everybody would guess this beer is barrel aged but to be honest I would not have been able to guess if the base beer was an Imperial Stout, Barley Wine or other.  The carbonation was very very soft but it worked with that sipper.  Far from a normal BA barley wine, this one is just different in a way I cannot put into words.  Whether it is a good thing or not, the girlfriend hates barley wines and bourbon barrel aged beers and she was totally crazy about this one.  This was an unexpected masterpiece.

3036,"2011-06-01",3.4,"2010 vintage, poured into a snifter. Thanks to a few folks for this.

3.5 A: Clear (I think) deep amber mahogany brown color. Two fingers of frothy tan head falls pretty quickly and leaves no lacing. A huge ABV will do that to you, I guess.

4.0 S: The aroma is good, but the bourbon overshadows the barleywine. Leathery, a touch of peat, oak and vanilla, and an almost nutty vibe. Underneath that there are hints of tobacco and dark fruitiness, molasses, brown sugar, booze, and a good helping of caramel.

4.0 T: The taste is more barleywine-forward for sure. Lots of tobacco, raisin, plum, prune, and date. Again somewhat nutty (perhaps from the bourbon, but who knows). Lots of molasses, brown sugar, and caramel. The bourbon kicks in after becoming accustomed to the malt flavors. Leathery, somewhat peaty in a smoky sense, and oak and vanilla from the barrel. Definitely sweet, but not cloying. The booze is very apparent, though. All 13.5% is realized.

3.5 M: Heavy body with a syruppiness to it. Just a touch chewy. Good moderate carbonation. Reasonably creamy, but a bit too hot to be as smooth as Id like.

4.0 D: This is a good beer, but it doesnt quite live up to the hype (at least not this vintage). I think this will be vastly improved in a few years after it is allowed to cool down a bit.

A: Pours a dark caramel with nice light tan head and lacing.

S: The initial whiff brings forward quite a bit of bourbon and alcohol. Underneath there is caramel, wood, vanilla, toffee, and a bit of dark fruits.

T: Again, the first taste brings forward tons of hot bourbon. The underlying flavors are all quite nice and complex, but it takes a while to sort through the hotness of it all. This is what keeps it down at a 4.0, although I could see an aged version of this absolutely creeping up to a 4.5 or even a 5.0, depending on how the heat recedes.

M: Even though this is fairly hot, the complexity is outstanding, begging me to slowly chew every sip of the beer.

D: This was a hard one to put down; sip after sip news things are developing. Would love to try this down the line with some more age on it.

2010 on tap at Pelican - The Mother of All Storms is an epic brew! After 3hrs of wandering the coastline in the rain taking pics I am finally delving into this brew. Weak coffee brown in colour, no cap. The aroma is stunning in complexity and appeal: bourbon, wood and a chocolate / caramel blend are really awesome. Vanilla and a burnt character have been arranged to perfection. Brown sugar sweetness rounds out the awesome aroma. Maybe a hint of berry and muted spearmint. Awesome favor and smoooooth and soothing. Incredible complexity and a perfect balance of flavor. Cocoa, vanilla - the best vanilla Ive ever had in a beer, light charred oak - lots of oak, dark caramel, brown sugar, light light roast, almond, toasty marshmallows. Goes back without even a hint of alcohol. Ultra smooth and velvety finish. A mind blowing brew!

2009 MOAS on tap at Pelican. Got only a 2oz sample of this but and wish I could do up a pint. Noted differences: Oddly there is a bite on the nose that was not found in the 2010.

Aroma is dark and powerful of tobacco, dark chocolate, oak, prunes, molasses, and a hint of bourbon. After tasting the beer one gets a flavor of cramelize sugar almost to the point of nearly burnt, a rather unusual flavor that I found to be awesome. Follow this by more oak notes, vanilla, dark fruit, and a presence of bourbon that warms you but does not overpower. I will be the first to say that I hate over-the-top bourbon barrel aging but this one seemed to be aged at just the right intensity, enough bourbon to let you know it is there but allows room for the base beer to shine through. This is a great beer. Lastly, after looking at some of the reviews I feel this beer may be misunderstood, this is very much a sipping beer. You must share this or be prepared for the 22 oz bottle to be your only beer of the night. I took the later option and it took me 4+ hours to drink the entire thing.

Big malt flavor as well. Has a strange grassy taste to it, but it doesnt detract too much from it. Lingering taste of bourbon and chocolate. Sharp alcohol burn at the end of each sip.

3036,"2010-03-06",3.0,"2009. Dark brown, almost black with a small beige head. Really off-putting grainy aroma with extremely sharp and totally crazy bourbon tones alongside some nuts, light chocolate, cocoa, cherries and way too much alcohol. A friend said ""dried dog food"" which basically sums it up. Flavor is simply too intense and bourbon hot with sharp alcohol, light fruit, caramell, fudge and vanilla but all these components is rather well hidden in there totally raped by the alcohol and the barrel. Ends on a sharp, hot and sweet note. Slightly sticky but smooth medium full mouthfeel, the better aspect of the brew.","Malmö, SWEDEN","andersand"

3036,"2010-02-21",4.3,"A: The pour is a dark, dark brown with some nice reddish highlights. The head is mild in volume and tan in color.

S: There is a surprising amount of chocolate (oxidation) in the aroma, but it works quite well. The usual suspects of caramel, toffee, vanilla, and dark fruit are there as well, along with some oak.

T: Like the aroma, there is a ton of chocolate to this beer--something I dont normally expect from a barleywine. The sweet, malty flavors, dark fruits, and barrel contributions (vanilla and a nice oaky flavor) make this amazingly complex. I just had to give it a 5.

M: Very nice and smooth. The carbonation is quite low, and the body is incredibly full.

D: The only place that this beer takes a bit of a hit. This shouldnt be surprising, however. But despite being 13.5% alcohol, it is surprisingly drinkable.

A - Pours a ruby tinted root beer stream with a short lived dark tan head that recedes to nothing. Only a few sips in, but no lace. The appearance should be a 4, but Im adjusting it to bump the taste to ~5.

Sweet caramel malt aroma with hints of honey, toffee, hazelnut and earthy leathery malts. Sweet alcohol, earthy oak and a boat load of vanilla accompanying the subtle bourbon character. There was not as much bourbon in the nose as I had expected and this is a nice change of pace. Very complex with a lot of interesting aromas going on here.

Nice soft carbonation up front with a medium body thats on the fuller end. Promient oaky tannis and a huge vanilla character from the oak aging. The bourbon is ore prominent in the flavor than in the aroma but again it isnt overpowering but rather is a nice compliment to the other complex flavors. Theres also a bit of dark fruit, especially raisin, fig and date balancing out the earthy leathery malt notes. The bourbon presence provides a bit of alcohol warmth but this beer is dangerously drinkable considering how well the high ABV is masked.

My review is for a 2009 bottle which I consider myself lucky enough to have gotten a few bottles of, thus affording me the opportunity to open one up. The 2009 StormWatcher batch was aged in the same Evan Williams barrels as the 2008 batch was.

Whoa, this beers aroma is pungent with vapors of vanilla, alcohol, and sweet malts as I removed the gold foil and opened it. A dark ruby/mahogany color fills my glass with a little head but theres some carbonation and lacing. Viscous, creamy, chewy, nutty, caramelly, toffee, and very bready. Can taste the oak character and bourbon as well.

This is definitely an easy sipping beer, if only to enjoy the complexities and enormity of this beers character. I found myself inhaling the aroma each time I would sip, just to appreciate it. The alcohol presence is there but very drinkable in a smooth warming sense on the finish. I wouldnt have known it was a 13% abv.

Pours a deep, clear copper with a short-lived cap of big bubbles that recedes to a small collar and leaves very little lacing, though there are boozy legs down the glass after each sip.

The aroma is massive and has plenty of bourbon sweetness and alcohol burn in the nose which mixes well with the sugary caramel malt and dark fruit in the nose.

The underlying caramel malts are the first thing I notice with some toffee and dark fruits.  There is definitely plenty of bourbon especially in the finish where there is a noticeable burn in the throat.  Overall, its like a caramel and chocolate dessert with raisins and plums soaked in bourbon.

The mouthfeel is stunning, one of the best Ive ever felt, like velvet.  Its smooth with ample, but soft, carbonation and slightly dry and woody in the finish with a sweet bourbon presence on the palate as well.

I wasnt sure what to expect on this one.  I saw everyone raving about it but just figured it wouldnt live up to the hype.  Well, it lives up to the hype.  Its a wonderful beer that drinks fairly easy for the high ABV.  The bourbon is strong right now and I think this one becomes even better with time.  Superb.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Bourbon barrel aged barleywines (and even imperial stouts) have not been my thing recently.  Maybe it is because everyone under the sun is doing it now but it has become apparent which beers hold up well and which dont mix at all.  This one is in the middle - while I liked it I think it would be just as good without the added influence of the aging.

Aroma / Appearance - The deep ruby red body is typical of a big barleywine.  A thin tan head indicates some carbonation is still present.  Resin, vanilla, and malt give it more life than the first barrel aged entry in a small flight but the ethanol is still strong throughout.

Flavor / Palate - Warm sheets of resin flow down the tongue.  Vanilla and other bourbon aspects are evident but do not completely overwhelm the underlying beer.  Mostly balanced I think this one could do with a few more months of mellowing at least before it is in perfect harmony.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3036,"2009-06-02",4.0,"Bottle thanks to toncatcher at his last tasting.  Pours orangey amber with a tan ring.  Nose is sweet malty and quite rich.  Taste is sweet, rich, malty, I likey this big old boozy BW.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
3036,"2009-05-31",4.1,"Vividly Vinious nose, oh so seriously boozy to boot.  Crazy burnt sienna and glossy appearance.  Refined, sticky, and charred-candy like flavors with a significant but balancing hop characteristic.  Nice burnt candy finish.  Nicely refined ale.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
3036,"2009-05-25",4.3,"Bottle.  Pours an amber brune body with an off white head.  Vinous bourbon and vanilla with a a light salty English style barely wine flavor.  Chewy vanilla plum and a light apple with a big lightly roasted malty etoh warming.  Great BW!","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
3036,"2009-05-19",3.5,"Pours clear brown with a tan ring of foam. Aroma of vanilla and alcohol. Medium body. Bourbon, chocolate, almond and toffee taste. Peppery alcohol finish. For me, the merits of this beer were outweighed by the hot alcohol character that dominated from beginning to end.","Kirkland, Washington, USA","bitbucket"
3036,"2009-04-24",4.3,"22oz Bomber  Sent from Pelican Brewing  Pacific City, OR. 
Aroma: Awesome Barley wine aroma with dried fruit, bourbon and oak also in the aroma. 
Appearance: Dark reddish amber in color, clear with a thin head.  
Flavor: Let this warm up and the flavors come alive.  The malt mixes well with the oak barrels and the bourbon and fruit flavors are excellent.   
Palate: Dry Oaky/Fruity finish, with a Good Barleywine sweet Mouthfeel.  
Overall: This was a awesome brew.  Flavors come alive the bourbon and oak are right there no missing them.  This brew will age well and be super smooth in a few years.  The alcohol will sneak p on you so be careful.  For #2000 this was well worth the wait and the Vigil for the beer is over. Darron from Pelican Thank You.  Next time FedEx I hope you come to the door when I am not in the can.","Olympia, Washington, USA","BrewDad"
3036,"2009-04-12",4.3,"Tried a 22 oz bottle of the 08 barrel aged Perfect Storm Barleywine the other night while playing cards.  At times, I actually thought I was drinking brandy.  This is a wonderful representation of a barleywine from a great brewery.  Strong malts support the alcohol content nicely and barrel aging creates the vanilla and oak in the finish.  One to sip and enjoy.","Florence, Oregon, USA","WertMaker"
3036,"2009-04-06",4.2,"Shared by Goldtwins.  Thanks Larry.  Great color.  Sweet as hell.  Nice vanilla bourbon chocolate carmelly thing going on.  Definately a sipper.  Nice stuff overall.","Livingston, New Jersey, USA","BrianK"
3036,"2009-03-22",4.2,"22 oz. bottle - wow, thanks hannont!!  pours a deep, dark brown with faint tan head; huge nose of vanilla, oak, bourbon, sugar and healthy dose of alcohol; reddish and clear along the edges; sight syrupy texture and quite thin body overall; oaky, earthy, sweet and delicious; a little hot right now and some age could work a little magic in improving an already terrific beer","Seattle, Washington, USA","SuzyGreenberg"
3036,"2009-03-22",4.2,"CPLYFO 09.  JMFG!  Thanks.  With how good the 2007 Stormwatchers was, it is no surprise that this was awesome as well.  (Although I preferred the original).  Pours a slightly more muddled amber than the original- good thin head and nice lace.  aroma is similar- loaded with big sweet fruity malts, toasted malts, munich, doughy, perhaps a bit more intense with dark deep fruits- raisin and a touch of apple, bourbon comes through a god amount- nutty, woody, vanilla and  sweet caramel bourbon with hints of citrus.  Good big malt flavor, toasty, syrupy sweet without being cloying, nice smooth bourbon- all in balance.  Big body, but the bourbon and oak seem to thin it out just a bit and also allows the alcohol to come through just a bit.  Really good, I just like the 2007 better.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
3036,"2009-03-22",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 19, 2010 Brown.  Lots of wood in the flavor and aroma.  Vanilla, from oak I assume.  Some whisky character, but it works well.  A little sweet.  Thanks to Skyview for sharing. 

2009 edition.  Bourbon and some spice.  Low carbonation.  Not nearly as good due to overwhelming bourbon.  I wont change my rating, but would rate this 6 3 6 3 13.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
3036,"2009-03-17",4.2,"Bomber, courtesy JMFG.  Pours lightly hazy and dark brown in color, with a frothy, foamy tan head.  A dense, sudsy wash leaves nice legging and bubbly, spotty lace behind.  Warming sour mash bourbon and oak show on the nose, lending just the right magical touch that such elements can offer to the chocolaty, caramely, toasted toffee notes underneath.  Already heavy on vanilla aromatics, the barrel pushes that envelope even further.  Hazelnut and pecans emerge, as do hints of maple and dark fruit.  Flavors are incredibly well balanced, soft and subtle bourbon serving to solidify the already impressive caramel, toffee, and nougat notes.  Woody and nutty, with sweet vanilla maple, the taste is just damn good.  Chewy and silky, the mouthfeel impresses in its lack of heat or stickiness.  Fantastic barrel application to an already great base beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
3036,"2009-03-16",4.0,"FRO Throwdown: Clear caramel color. Molasses soaked prunes. Madeira, oaky, sherry, oxidized a tad (good). Very sweet with a ton of caramel-sweets and chocolate, almost cloying but its not. Some maple syrup? 28th beer of the throwdown, and at this strength put me right over the edge!","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
3036,"2009-03-16",4.2,"Courtesy JMFG.  Pours a lighter brown color, with a small off white head.  Smells of dark fruits and malts, big a nice dose of bourbon, oak and vanilla.  The flavor is pretty big and bold.  Got alot of he bready yeast characters, but soaked in bourbon and vanilla cream, which made for a real tasty combo.  Dark fruits and malts were left in the finish, and this drank real smooth for its abv.  Very nice brew.  Very good.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"
3036,"2009-03-14",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 15, 2009 JMFG again!!!  A bit lighter colored than the Stormwatchers.  Aroma is awesome, notes of burnt orange, toasted hazelnuts, marzipan.  Flavor is massive, with notes of treacle.  The bourbon really shines through.  The beer is absolutely incredible.","Saint Cloud, Florida, USA","CheesedMan"
3036,"2009-03-12",4.3,"[Bottle] shared at Skyviews Lex/Larp Cellars Farewell. This was probably the beer of the night. Pours a clear mahogany with a smallish off-white head. Aroma is awesome, and loaded with coconut, vanilla, cherry, bourbon, and alcohol. Really an interesting nose. The bourbon manifested itself as more of a coconut and vanilla thing than a grainy whisky thing. Flavor is significant alcohol, bourbon, cherry, caramel, coconut, vanilla, and oak. Really nice beer, and the whisky was deftly blended.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","MatSciGuy"
3036,"2009-03-09",4.0,"22oz., 2008 bottle, with thanks to theisti for getting the Pelican order together so I had a chance to try this.  Pours a clear burgundy with a loose tan head of larger bubbles.  Nice malty nose, with dried dark fruits, caramel, bourbon, oak, and some light vanilla and coconut notes.  Flavor is more dark fruits, bourbon, oak, caramel and hints of vanilla.  Overall the alcohol sits a little stronger than I care for, but everything else still works well together albeit pushed a bit to the background.  More subtlety would make this a world class BA barleywine, but still very good in its own right.","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"
3036,"2009-03-03",4.1,"(bottle from Skyview)  Pours dark ruby with no head.  The aroma is potent, but in a very good way.  Strong aromas of coconut, vanilla, oak, alcohol, and red vines licorice.  The flavor is full of sweet cherry and caramel right off the bat, but switches quickly to a finish of wood, bourbon, and booze.  Its a bit rough around the edges, but its still great right now.  I cant imagine how good this would be with a couple more years on it when the alcohol mellows and slight oxidation kicks in.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
3036,"2009-03-02",4.3,"Picked up single 22-oz bottle from Pelican Pub & Brewery mail order. Pours a semi-clear mahogany brown brew with a fast dissolving off-white head that dissipates clean. Aroma of coconut, vanilla, bourbon, some caramel, and raisin. Taste is medium to full bodied, smooth, with a rich flavor of raisin, coconut, light chocolate, caramel and most of all, bourbon. Finish is semi-sweet, smooth with a mild lingering vanilla/coconut and bourbon aftertaste. By far, one of the best bourbon barrel aged barleywines I have tried.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
3036,"2009-03-02",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2010 Courtesy of Skyview, bless the man.  Dark red color with no head.  Big coconut, oak and vanilla aroma.  Just glorious.  Huge sweet malt, caramel and light chocolate flavors.  Blended excellently with the vanilla and coconut from the bourbon barrel.  Bourbon is certainly there, but not domineering, no matter what JK says.  Excellent.
