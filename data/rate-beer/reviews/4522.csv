Much more malt than your average lager, the carbonation was just smooth enough to hit it off for me, especially considering the fact that it was scorching hot outside.  Like a beefed up Pilsener Urquell.  Even ale zealots will appreciate this one.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"
4522,"2005-06-12",3.0,"A really distinctive pilsner type flavour. Two things - munch malt and saaz hops! Well balanced. Clean tasting. Lots of flavour, but perhaps not as sharp as some pilsners.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","Mullo"
4522,"2005-06-10",3.7,"draught. light golden body with a small white head. solid pilsener aroma consists of cookie dough and lots of saaz - its pretty much exactly what youd want out of this style. crisp body with moderate hopping along with sweet soft malts. very flavourful and refreshing. Id like some of this on hand in Toronto.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"
4522,"2005-03-27",3.7,"ark golden lager with a thin white head. Malty aroma with notes of strawberries and light crisp hops. Crisp malt with wonderful fruity hops with notes of oranges. Nutty notes comes out nicely. Medium and balanced bodied.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
4522,"2005-03-24",3.1,"Almost clear, orange-tan with a frothy, white head that lasts 2-3 minutes and produces nice lacing.  Strangely, the aroma seemed a bit sour, but with a clean maltiness and a small amount of Saaz hops.  Blast of malty lager flavour accentuated by a curious sourness.  Crisp with subtle noble hops and a little bit of graininess.  Light to medium body, moderate carbonation and a bit of a dry feeling at the end.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"
4522,"2005-03-19",3.3,"TAP: Cheesy lager nose with a slight spice kick, hazy gold color, low head. Nice unfiltered body - lets the character of this beer come through. Honey-ish malt with a decent broad, but light hop bitter end. Some butter tastes in the middle, unfortunately. More on the thin and refreshing side of things.","GERMANY","pivo"
4522,"2005-03-15",3.5,"on tap at the brewpub, pours a light amber, crystal clear and sparkling.  head was thin and creamy.  aroma was hoppy, with hints of yeast and spices.  flavor was just as hoppy if not more, tones of caramel and some spice tones.  the bitterness at the end was prominent, but not to the point that i was put off by it.  very crisp mouthfeel, with a pleasant amount of body for a pilsner.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","richlikebeer"
4522,"2005-03-08",3.9,"On draught at the brewpub, 3/5/05 with Muzzlehatch and tiggmtl.  Poured out of a pitcher.  A sparkling golden-yellow with light burnished copper tinges, quite lovely looking with plenty of white head and tons of lace.  Smells of herbal, spicy hops and plenty of dough.  Good yeast character, very perfumy, strong, peppery nose.  Flavor opens up with strong hops notes.  They certainly got every last ounce of bitterness out of those hops!  Crisp to the extreme, very spicy and with a strong, honey and doughy malt to follow.  Damn, this is very forceful with the hops bitterness, with tons of bite from the yeast.  Awesome body on this one, didnt find the thinning some have talked about.  I actually thought this was too hoppy, but that was really my only complaint.  Love the spicy, fiery, warming flavors.  Id go back for more of this in a second.  Went very well with rabbit and spaetzle.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4522,"2005-01-17",3.0,"Draft... Clear, golden lager with a rocky head.  The nose is of citrus fruit and very bready. The flavor matches the nose. Light-bodied and creamy with fizzy carbonation. Crisp, lightly bitter  finish.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
4522,"2004-11-19",4.0,"Small creamy and frothy white head, fair lacing, mostly diminushing.  Golden body of average thick density.  Moderate to heavy malt aroma.  Caramel, light to moderate hops and little trace of honey on the nose.  Average to heavy sweetness in flavor.  Moderate sweetness in finish.  Sweet over the hop bitterness (could be balanced a bit more toward the hop bitterness).  Average to long persistance of flavors in my mouth.  Medium body, a bit oily and syrupy.  Soft carbonation.  Tasted on tap at the brewpub in a small tasting glass, 2nd of 10 beer in this session (18 november 2004).","Geneva, SWITZERLAND","SimonB"

The flavor is near perfect, theres floral, fruity, noble hops with hay and crisp, robust malt, it finishes with bitterness. The body has a full thickness with a creamy texture and gentle carbonation. This is a superb pilsener.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"

4522,"2003-11-12",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 19, 2007 Solid appearance for a pilsner, golden with a big white head, very foamy and nicely sticky. Aroma of baked cookies, pancakes and light fresh Saaz hops. This is pretty good, good malty character well-balanced by the meticulous hopping which bring a nice herbal saaz cripsness, the finish is a little watery, the bottom of the keg perhaps.. The body is top notch though, filling and velvety. / A few weeks later, I find it far less crisp with a more restrained Saaz character, surprisingly not so consistent? From 3.7 to 3.4/ Seems to vary between 3.1 and 4.1 between my visits. Ill round this up to 3.6, but know that you can face something spectacular when ordering this.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4522,"2003-10-06",2.3,"Pale strawy colour, not much in the way of head. Had sort of a funky floral hoppy odour that was not altogether pleasing. Slight caramel notes. Didn't really taste off per se but I really didn't care for it.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

Hops nicely balance malty flavour with a nice crispness and a restrained but lasting bitterness. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. Subdues carbonation allows appreciation of the subtleties of this offering at length. On tap at the brewpub. Original rating 6-4-9-4-18=4.1: Somewhat slight hop aroma.

4522,"2002-12-16",4.1,"This is the best Czeck Pilsner Ive yet had that is brewed in North America.  It has a huge Saaz profile, but pretty much all bittering character, perhaps a little in the flavour but none in the aroma.  A totally quenching beer.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","dhurtubise"

4522,"2002-07-05",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2012 Note: Since theyve switched to whole leaf Saaz (they used pellets before), this beer has gone from very good to world-class. A simply gorgeous BohPils.
The Lure:Lovely biscuity pils malt and yeast interplay serving as fluffy cushions for the hovering oily, earthy Saaz hoppiness. Mild citrus fruit swimming within. This is a spot-on quality re-creation of the Czech pils which many Czech breweries would be proud of. The only thing which could be improved upon for a perfect emulation would be a loftier head of foam, as this one possesses a very shy, although lingering, ring.

The Festivities:Again, the pils malt cookies and Czech yeast hug so amorously, they are difficult to distinguish separately. Oily, earthy hops are prolonged into a sublime grassy, herbal bitterness, aided into balance by the aforementioned yeast/malt love affair. Citrus fruit are definitely admitted into this humble palace, and converse amicably with all participants. I can practically smell the cheese-filled meat and its paprika sauce, and see the accompanying knedlikys and potato pancakes, this is how real this bohemian pilsner is.

Transcendence:Red roofs, cobblestone streets, intermingling gothic and renaissance architectures, church spires on the expansive town square...peace within me.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
