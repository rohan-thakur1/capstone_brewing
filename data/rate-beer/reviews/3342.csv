3342,"2016-12-30",3.9,"Can shared with Linh in Madison, GA. Pours a hazy golden body with huge frothy white head. Nose is slightly dank, skunk hop and crisp grassy character. Mouthfeel is clean, thin and sessionable with notes of lemon, grass and light fruity hop.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
3342,"2016-11-04",4.2,"Can from Gambrinus. Pours a slightly hazy straw gold with a finger of foam that lingers. Huge dank nose with lemon and grapefruit. Tons of dankness on the palate. Light bodied, but still refreshing. Lemon zest and white grapefruit. More headiness in the finish. Bitterness is there, but restrained. Loved this one!","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"
3342,"2016-11-04",4.1,"Tallboy can from Wine Warehouse, 5/28/16. Hazy yellow, large foamy white head. Good retention. Aroma of grapefruit, lime and pale malt. The taste is grapefruit, lime, pale malt. Medium bodied, well balanced.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
3342,"2016-07-08",3.6,"Pour is a cloudy yellow with a huge white head. Aroma is a real nice dank and resinous hop. Its kind of all over the place. I get some fruit, green onion and mint. Flavor is more of a lemon zest with maybe some mango. The body is thin and the mouth feel is soft but the hops flavor is still there in a big way. Pretty flavorful beer for only 4.2%. If all session IPAs have this much of a hop profile we would not need any 10% monsters.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
3342,"2016-06-20",3.8,"16oz can from The Beer Shoppe (Ardmore). Pours a hazy pale yellow color with a finger of foamy white head. Aroma of citrus zest, pineapple, grapefruit, bready malts, and hints of tangerine. Taste is grainy/grassy, notes of citrus zest, grapefruit, and tangerines. Solid, but its no Boat Beer!","Forked River, New Jersey, USA","Ed5388"
3342,"2016-04-24",3.7,"Aroma is very dank hops and mild notes of fruit and citrus. The flavor is grapefruit, tropical fruit, not much in the way of malts and a mix of light bitterness and tart in the finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
3342,"2016-03-27",3.6,"Big can. Pours a clear yellow color with a medium white head. A big sweet fruity nose. The flavor is lemons, bready, oranges, quite nice. Very floral.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
3342,"2016-03-23",3.7,"Tall can at Churchkey with Strumke on it. Hazy pale yellow color. Nice aroma of peppery summer fruit. Taste has white pepper, fruity straw.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3342,"2016-03-23",3.8,"[Can (473ml)] Pours a slightly hazy, bubbly yellow-gold with a large lasting frothy white head. Mild lacing. Pleasant hoppy aroma -- citrusy, herbal and tropical fruity. Only slightly watery flavour of citrus and herbal hops along with tropical fruit. Medium bitter finish. Average to medium bodied. Quite good.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"
3342,"2016-03-20",4.4,"Clear light golden with a thin, sticky but dissipating white cap. Surprisingly big floral and resiny nose with some dank citrus rind. Crisp and dry flavor with a nice hoppy earthy dank flavor with plenty of bright citrus rind and a little bit of floral resins, but overall somewhat dry and balanced pale malt backbone. Lovely hoppy flavor without being overly bitter. Leafy, resiny and lightly dank.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
3342,"2016-03-16",3.9,"The beer pours clear golden with a white head. The aroma has mango, pineapple, dankness and rich malt which completely smells like a much bigger beer than it is. It has a fairly thin body that has a nice roughness and moderate carbonation. The taste starts with pineapple, pine, grapefruit and very dry malt. The finish has some woody hops added. Good for an IPA, even better for a session IPA.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
3342,"2016-03-13",3.9,"Can from Berkeley Bowl. It pours a mostly clear pale yellow color with a frothy white head. Very pale color. The aroma is potent and grassy with citrus and light tropical fruit. Hop spice, flowers, grapefruit, passionfruit. Maybe a light hint of crackers. Very hop forward. The flavor is pretty much the same with more focus on the orange and grapefruit and only light hints of passionfruit. Medium to strong grassy, spicy bitterness. Maltiness is very restrained and only comes across as lightly crackery. The body is light, but surprisingly mouth coating for the lack of malt. Clean. A very good example of a Session IPA. Refreshing.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3342,"2016-03-12",3.9,"Can at Underground. Pours a clear gold with a large white head. Big hop juice on the nose, melon, citrus, mango, papaya, orange. Medium bodied, spicy tropical fruit, moves to some musky citrus with the faintest hints of sweaty mango. Super smooth, creamy, gentle wheat and musk. Gentle finish with musk and light bitterness. Gorgeous.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
3342,"2016-03-11",3.8,"16 oz single can from the Craft Beer Cellar - Fort Collins. Pale yellow appearance with a white head. Nice hop aroma, bursting with fresh citrus, tropical fruits, grass and light pine. Similar flavor, fresh and hoppy with a mild zesty bitterness. Light, smooth and easy drinking overall.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
3342,"2016-03-02",4.2,"Can: Super hoppy aroma of tangerines, daffodils, cat pee, and mangos. Clear yellow, thick sticky off white head. Dandelion and tangerine. Lemongrass finish. Light body, soft carbonation. Fabulous.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"

3342,"2016-02-22",3.7,"Medium statured white head, lasting, good lace. Lightly hazy, pale blond color. Fat little, danky nose, burnt wiring, citrus. Light bodied, prickly carbontion, clean, little bit of aspirin. Dry malts, grainy, nice hop bill, citrus and fruit, lemons and dankyness, nice. Bone dry finish, awesome bite. Well done Brian! Only drawback is the price but i imagine that has something to do with being brewed at Against the Grain. Their beers are not inexpensive to say the least! Very quaffable brew but will not be a regular for me at almost $4.50 a can.","Ceciltucky, Co., Maryland, USA","sloth"
3342,"2016-02-15",4.0,"16 ounce can. Pours a slightly darkish hue but then the hops in nose and taste kick in. Bit mosaic like notes. Very flavorful. Very crushable.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
3342,"2016-02-15",4.0,"16oz can at Maxs Belgian Fest 2016 pours a clear, watery straw gold with some lacing white head. Nose is zippy with grass and hop, lemon rind, straw, some sea foam. Flavor follows, very light grain bill, a little salinity then all grass, straw, mild soap, mild herbs. Finishes dry and zippy. So drinkable.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
3342,"2016-02-07",3.8,"Can. Poured a clear amber color with an average frothy white head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Moderate to heavy hop and malt aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy bittersweet flavor with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. My expectations where exceeded.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3342,"2016-01-30",4.2,"Pint can from Old Town; shared with my Boo. Aroma: Big stone fruit and salted lime hop presence backed by very light pilsener type grains. Appearance: Pale gold, very slightly hazy body with healthy carbonation holding up a solid white cap. Flavor: Salted lime up front with stone fruit developing thereafter; towards the finish a little grain sneaks in and ultimately terminates dry and slightly bitter. Palate: Light body, sticky texture, lively carbonation, abrupt finish. Overall: Stellar session beer, though the price (nearly $4 a can) makes it a cost prohibitive choice.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"
3342,"2016-01-27",3.8,"16oz can, from Dutchs. Mostly clear golden color, with a bigger, airy softly fizzing white head. Settles, and leaves good frothy lace. Awesome big citrusy hop, some mild pine, pepperiness. Kiwi, lime. Really big, bursting hop. Moderate to bigger bitter taste. Light to moderate sweet, kind of dry. Lighter to medium body. Kind of soft carbonation. Really tasty SIPA. Very big bright hop here.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
