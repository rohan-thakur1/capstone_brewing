3939,"2015-12-08",4.1,"Bottle... This beer rocks! Pours hazy and deeply red with a small, fleeting, pink head. I can only assume this smells like citric and lactic acids, grains and cherries, because I have a sinus infection. I cant smell anything today and its frustrating. Medium to full-bodied with tickling carbonation. The flavor is tart and fruity  so very nice. Tons of tart cherries and tannic cherry skins in both the flavor and the crisp, fruity finish.

3939,"2015-08-21",3.4,"Dégustée à multiples reprises, en fût comme en bouteille. Bière à la robe rouge claire et transparente coiffée dune mousse rosée éphémère et sans histoire. La bière est brassée avec une quantité de cerises telle que tout est profondément exagéré. Tant les arômes que les saveurs sont orientés sur une quantité phénoménale de noyaux de cerises et de pelure de cerises. Cest acide certes, mais au-delà de lacidité on sent une présence dérangeante de sucre, exactement comme un sirop à la cerise destiné à la confection dun dessert. Cest sirupeux, liquoreux même si lalcool est bien dissimulé et long en bouche. Finale de noyaux de cerises. Une fois par année me suffit amplement.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
3939,"2015-08-14",2.9,"Bière rouge aux reflets quelque peu orangées, bien voilée, effervescence élevée, et surmontée dun col rose pas tellement large et moyennement dense, qui sestompe assez rapidement pour ne laisser que quelques traces à la surface du liquide. Arôme de pain frais, foin et grain, avec bonne dose de fruits rouges, des cerises certes, mais je trouve que ça sent surtout les fraises, et aussi un peu les framboises. On note également quelques effluves acidulés rappelant un peu le citron, mais aussi le yogourt nature. En fait, je trouve que cette bière sent le yogourt aux fraises, ou peut-être même les fraises à la crème, et ça fait franchement un peu artificiel. Nez tout de même bien agréable, bonne intensité, complexité moyenne. En bouche, pétillement moyen-faible sur la langue, breuvage plutôt mousseux, onctuosité moyenne au palais, on note un certain corps, une certaine rondeur. Au goût, cest très acide dès lentrée en bouche, à la limite du tolérable pour moi, cest très citronné. Lorsque cette acidité se dissipe un peu, on note quelques saveurs de foin et de fruits rouges. Tout comme au nez, je dirais que ça ne goûte pas nécessairement franchement les cerises, et que ça goûte même peut-être davantage les fraises. Acidité clairement dominante, bière peu sucrée, amertume inexistante. Complexité plutôt faible parce que trop déséquilibrée (trop acide!), et mis à part lentrée très acide, lintensité des saveurs reste plutôt moyenne. Même conclusion que sa consur aux framboises : correcte sans plus. Les Berliner Weisse ne sont pas des bières brassées pour moi","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","pumpkinhead2"

Just beautiful. Nose is gorgeous, deep yoghurt culture, light sour with huge amount of cherries, lots of juice. Taste unfortunately comes across a bit muted compared to the smell, lots of juice but mixed in with fair amount of cherry pits, leaves and a mineral / stone  like feeling to it all, yoghurt culture is faint here, tad dry. Body is all juice, dries out just like fruit skins. Heavy fruit profile almost begs comparison to a lambiek but that is unfair since it doesnt have the same depth; This is very straightforward, very drinkable as well. I could have wished for more but seeing as I have been less than enamoured with my resent brushes with the styles I can only applaud this. This is what I wish Berliners in general would taste like.

The balance thereof is tilted more towards the sour end, but theres just enough sweetness from the cherries to make this enjoyably tart, instead of painfully so, and the carbonation is deliciously fizzy/bubbly. My only qualm....I kind of feel like the notion of flavouring sour malts with sweet fruit inadvertently paved the way for crappy wine coolers and Bacardi breezers, kind of like how the Immigrant Song accidentally paved the wave for Norwegian death metal, but I digress.

3939,"2008-07-14",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 11, 2010 In short: A nice sharp cherry beer.  Very refreshing and highly drinkable.
How: Tap at brewpub (summer 2008 batch)
The look: Clear light-red body topped by a short-lived pink head
In long: Nose is cherries (duh!) .  This one has a pure natural freshly picked cherries aroma, not maraschino cherries.  Taste is sharp, surprisingly very little cherry sourness, slightly acidic, dry, a little lemony, nice astringency.  Very refreshing beer.  As far as cherry beers go this one is probably the exact opposite of the New Glarus Belgian Red (the most well-known example of the style).  On one end you have the Belgian Red from New Glarus Wisconsin with its filling and sweet maraschino cherries character and on the other end youve got the Solstice d Été aux Cerises from Montreal with its sharp refreshing astringency fresh cherry flavour.  And in between the two youve got well Detroit.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Flavor on this medium bodied beauty is tart cherries with a slight bitter aftertaste. Very good indeed.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
3939,"2007-08-28",3.2,"While I was drinking my first pint, I saw this beauty walk by several times.  She was intriguingly attractive in the light which came through the windows.  A wonderful stawberry body an attractive off-white to cherry head.  The aroma is sweet and tart with cherries.  Very tart on the tounge.  I should have had this one last!  Big blod flavors, strong lemon presence.  Bitterness is there, but well balanced.","New Jersey, USA","EtownEraser"
3939,"2006-09-26",3.1,"Aroma is a good hit of cherry, clear pomegranite, tiny off-white head. Light flavour of cherry, some malt as well. Light bodied, sweet, refreshing. Pretty good. Perhaps the year of aging didnt do any favours to this one.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DougShoemaker"
3939,"2006-09-20",3.7,"Sampled draught at DDC on August 26 in the company of tiggmtl, ClarkVV and Olivier_MTL; served in a tall weizen glass.  Looks awful purty sitting in the elegant glass, hazy deep pink-red with just a smidgeon of creamy lasting foam....really intense aroma, both sweet and tart cherries and more biscuity malt than I recall in other examples of the style.....on the tongue, tart throughout but never really sour, quite restrained actually which Id guess would bum some fans of the style out but makes it very quaffable indeed; very juicy with lots of real fresh-cherry character....smooth and easy drinking but not ultra complex; heavier on the malt in the body as well as the aromatics, this is a delight but have no idea if its really ""true"" to style, seems a bit heavy.  Still, another winner from DDC no question.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
3939,"2006-09-19",3.1,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2006 Draught.  At Dieu du Ciel.  Aged 1.5 years in a cask, and as Olivier_mtl said, perhaps not really a beer to age that long ...  Poured hazy pink-red with a small white head.  Buttery-buttescotch aroma (diactyl?) initially, then some light grain and vague mildly sour cherry.  The taste was quite pleasing - sour cherries, woody acidity, sweet malt - nice, but should be FUNKY.  Slick, oily mouthfeel, decent carbonation, very light acidity, a slightly sour and sticky finish - not bad, sort of disappointing - I would love to try a fresh -brewed batch one day.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

3939,"2006-09-07",3.3,"Draught weizen glass at DdC, 8/26/06.Softly hazy, slightly cloudy, with not a bright, intense red, but more a tangerine-pink with some deeper red highlights in the middle.  Off-white head perched atop is initially foamy and about a finger in height, but quickly recedes to partial cover/ring, with light lacing in patches.Nutty and acidic, sort of like cherry flesh, but without any of the sweetness or juiciness.  Dry, for sure, with the signature sour mash tartness (I dont know if Id go as far as to call it sour in the nose).  Very wheaty, recalling the just-mentioned nuttiness, which also adds a bit of dryness itself, but perhaps dulls the aroma slightly.  As it breathes/warms, a bit more acidity comes from the cherries, quite a bit more pleasant and more lively, but overall it just never really establishes a hard lactic or cherry tartness/sourness.Right away you can feel the dryness.  Bone dry, but a strong nutty, blanding wheat-like sensation, smooths out the tartness.  Almost astringent-like cherry flavor is fleshy, dry, quite acidic.  Lactic notes are rather tame, getting lost, a bit, in the zesty, boisterous carbonation and fair amount of aqueous space it opens up.  Still, a true, authentic, lip-smacking cherry tartness is there, mostly on the finish and while it may disappoint a bit, in overall strength, it certainly is drinkable and flawless.  No alcohol noted.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Dark pink-red body with a tiny head that fades. 3+ Sweet and sour cherry in the aroma. 7+ Flavour has a modest sourness throughout, sweet cherry has a candyish quality to it despite being real cherries (I assume). A bit of funk in the aftertaste grows as you go. 7+ Average to light bodied palate. Solid but the raspberry version is much more to my tastes. 7/3/7/3/13-14 On tap at Volo, Toronto
2005-09-XX. Ruby red body, small creamy pink head. Tart, mildly yeasty and fruity aroma. Predominance of cherries with underlying tart-sour quality. Quite fruity. Less intensely sour than I remember the raspberry being but less quenching at the same time. Sourness lingers in a way that is pleasant at times and less so  intermittently.

3939,"2005-09-05",3.9,"Impressive, vibrant red with a slick of froth that contrasts with its pearly white color.  It really does look like those alcopop nightmares...
Strong, fruity acidity that reminded of raspberry flavored vinegar or a dry rosé wine, it had a floral-like sweetness that didnt come out at all in the taste, sort of like eau-de-rose or those flowery essences they use to make some mediterranian desserts.
Whoh, this stuff is tang-tastic!  Lip-smacking, like pure, unsweetened cranberry juice.  May not be for everyone, but I seriously believe that its impossible to make a Beer more refreshing than this.  Light, wheaty body, and a dry mead aftertaste.

3939,"2005-08-26",3.3,"Beautiful clouded pale ruby. Mostly lasting white 1cm cover, fully carbonated. Juicy, ripe fruit aroma, fleshy and lactic. Tart mouthfeel, though not as astringent as the raspberry one was. A most classy end of summer refresher, but not a personnal favorite. The carbonation was intense, but not as engaging and crisp, the wheat less like a cracker you want to chew on, with lesser leafy bitterness. More simple than an amourette and kinda diluted. Highly competent as a fruit beer and very easy to drink nonetheless.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Delectable cherries and subtle wheat are involved in a lovely, soul-mate interplay with an oily lemon juice...Sweet and sour cherries take all the room to display their multi-faceted wonders...Like all of their berliners, this feels ultra-fresh, packed with the life of hundreds of sweet and tart fruit...Sourness is subdued compared to  their vibrant Framboise, which is their best berliner weisse I think, but Dieu du Ciel is no doubt one of the best fruit brewers I have encountered...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
