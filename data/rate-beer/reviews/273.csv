Clear, pale yellow body. For me the aroma is just like water from boiling rice and quite strong alcohol fusel. Flavor is boiled rise water and alcohol as well.

I dont know much about Sake, but I cant believe this strong alcohol flavor make this one of the better samples. Its simply to sharp on the alcohol.
