1432,"2017-03-17",3.3,"I first had this ""Old Beer"" in D-Town. I believe it was a special offering after they expanded the brewery; for sure, they brewed it for their 10th birthday. Recently, I bought a growler at Kennett Square, and I poured into a pint glass. Theres a slight, sweet malt nose. Nice amber coloring with a white head (very similar to their Festbier). Expertly balanced with a strong malt presence and a bitter after bite. Has a heavy feel being a lager, but its easy going down at 5%. Cheers!","New Jersey, USA","MacNJ"

 Served on tap in a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer is served a lighter copper-deep amber color with a one finger white head. The head fades relatively quickly leaving a very light level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is lighter overall, but has notes of a lightly toasted bread and a bit of a herbal hop and a light sweetness of caramel.

 Taste  The taste is very much as would be expected from the nose. It starts with a lightly roasted bready flavor mixed with a bit of caramel sweetness. The sweetness fades a bit as the taste moves on all while a herbal and slightly grassy hop taste comes to the tongue. These flavors are joined by some more light earthy flavors, to in the end, leave a rather light and crisp flavor on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is rather light and thin with a carbonation level that is rather average. The thinner body and moderate carbonation are good for the lighter flavors and create a very crisp and easy drinking brew. 

 Overall  More on the refreshing side, but a little bit low in the flavor profile which all in all makes for a nice easy drinking session brew.","","Darkmagus82"

The taste is lightly sweet and lightly malty as well. There is a slight hopliness.

1432,"2012-11-24",3.5,"On tap. Pours a mostly clear darker shade of orange, with a big, dense foamy cream-colored head, leaves good lace. Nose has some good earthy hops, chocolate malts, rich dark fruit characteristics. Light body. Smooth, light carbonation. Clean finish. Description is spot-on, it is impressing how easy to drink and refreshing this is, yet it still has a great flavor. Altbier has been a confusing style for me so far, because most of the ones Ive tried have been imperial versions, and each one tastes drastically different. This, I think, is an example of the style that makes sense, finally. Good chocolate, nutty flavors, light earth, little herbal. Light bitter / sweet taste. Good stuff, a really unique experience.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

1432,"2010-03-06",3.3,"20100306 tap at brewpub. According to the bartender, this is new, not a rebadge. Menu says 5.1 abv, so this may warrant a new entry by someone in the know. Light bronze color with sturdy tan head. Aroma was soapy hops, white yeasty bread. Body was light, too light, with huge, aggressive eff that was more distracting than anything. Light bready and pepper notes to finish. Lingering hop floral notes. Again Im thinking that many of these beers are tasting the same.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
