5 Weird aroma, a touch fruity, apple and pear, but also some gone-off cheese.
1 Could be water. Could be vodka. Could be a mix of the two. Who knows? Who cares? For a sake, this is probably a straight-down-the-middle average 3, but I dont think look should even be rated in a style where looks like this are typical.
5 Mostly inoffensive, the apple and other fruity components are there again in the retronasals, but generally theres little to grab on to in the taste. I dont believe it was made for there to be something to grab on to, so thats not a flaw, but, like vodka, tasting of as little as possible is a negative as well as a positive.
2- Only getting 2 so the things that I give 1 to stand out. There is no palate, its just devoid of any tangible body. But its not offensive, and it doesnt burn, so it must stand out from the 1s.

3181,"2010-05-22",1.4,"So this is my first sake rating. I guess I cant really rate this like I do a beer. In fact, I dont really know if I can rate sake at all. After all, Ive only had maybe 5 different kinds in my entire life, and theyre kinda hard to come by here in Norway. Regardless, Ill try and say something about this one that makes sense, from a sake amateurs perspective. First of all, this is not a very enjoyable drink in and by itself. Hints of rice, but the booziness and thin, vodka-like palate has room for much more complexity and taste than this. I suspect its main purpose is to accompany traditional Japanese food; while Gekkeikan Traditional Sake tastes like over-yeasted detergent blended carefully with water when drunk alone, its actually pretty ok with sushi. Especially after that strong wasabi - the sake just smooths it out with amazing efficiency. Nevertheless, this is not a drink I can actually recommend to anyone, and Ill look forward to drinking better stuff in the future.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

Flavor is sweet rice, light vinegar, light solvent notes, stale apple juice, a strange, tangy taste that reminds me of the smell of latex paint (cant remember ever actually tasting paint), and light banana oil to the finish. This stuff doesnt taste too good between probably 90F and 75F, really weird stuff comes out that I cant fully explain, once it gets closer to room temp it tastes more like it does when hot-which isnt bad. Palate is light bodied, with a slightly slick entry leading to an off dry finish with a moderate alcohol burn going down that seems to get a little stronge in the stomach than I would expect from 15.6%, maybe acid content doing that.

3181,"2008-12-21",2.2,"In Seattle, Gekkeikan is sort of the poor students sake.  It comes in many different sized bottles, looks vaguely Japanese so as to impress ones friends, and has the basic framing of sake flavors and qualities.  But really, theres not much more to it.  When served chilled the Gekkeikan Traditional Sake tastes a bit like they mixed a reasonably decent sake with rubbing alcohol.  It really numbs the tongue, making subsequent sips wholly empty.  It does, however, improve greatly with a little warmth, and though I havent tried it, I suspect this might be the only sake Ive tried so far that may be better off heated as they do so blasphemously in American Japanese restaurants.  That said, because of its cost relative to other sake, it is a popular drink for social occasions, and makes a great social activity, especially if you have a set of the tokkuri and ochoko and enough people to sit around and pour each other servings of sake/  Might also be a good sake for cooking, like salmon marinades.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Sweet fruity flavor mid palate.  I didnt find the alcohol burn to be that noticeable.  has a thick , smooth, viscous feel in the mouth.  Finishes sweet with a taste that reminds me a bit of maple syrup.  Im pleased with my first sake tasting.","AUSTRALIA","thehipone"
3181,"2005-09-27",2.4,"Also my first sake(is this one most commonly found?). very clear with a yellowish shine. aroma: flowery, marsipan, almond. taste: cheesy, radish, spicy, citrussy, alcohol-burn and...rice. getting more complex when warming up a bit. not bad, but not something i would drink on a daily basis.","Veendam, NETHERLANDS","Otje"
3181,"2005-07-08",2.5,"My first sake rating.
Completely clear pour with flowery nose.  Fruity, candy-like flavor with alcohol kick, mildly sour aftertaste.  I cant tell if this is good or not since I know next to nothing about sake, but I bet I can learn...","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","jgentgesdo"
3181,"2005-07-01",2.4,"750ml bottle: Totally clear without any color.  I couldnt tell this from water.  Aroma is very perfumy and sweet with notes of alcohol soaked orange, mild tobacco growing in rain-soaked earth, floral plant, and spicy alcohol that burns the nose slightly.  Taste is an almost sour apple one top of rice to start, then a bit of candy orange, berry, and a hint of band aid.  Theres quite a bit of alcohol burn to this one, especially if you hold it in your mouth to attempt to discern flavors, though interestingly the burn comes late.  Aftertaste is a bit like the hard coating on a brie, with a hint of rice pudding and mold.  Mouthfeel is like a syrupy, spicy water, though it seems to have a bit more weight to it than water (thats the best I can do to describe it).","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"
3181,"2005-04-15",2.8,"Well, I suppose if you are tasting sake you need to come to this sooner or later. Not quite as bad as I thought it would be but a definite overpowering alcohol taste and aroma. Could be a decent drink if the alcohol wasnt so strong.","Nampa, Idaho, USA","IdahoJizake"
3181,"2005-02-15",2.3,"Served warm. Distinct pale yellow colour. Sweet banana-like aroma and flavour. Lightly acidic and noticable alcohol. Light bodied, a touch oily mouthfeel.","Halifax, Nova Scotia, CANADA","OKBeer"
3181,"2005-01-16",2.7,"Clear color with a sweet, slightly fruity nose. Thin body with hints of rice.  Im no expert on Sake, but this wasnt so good. Rather flavorless.","GERMANY","pivo"
3181,"2005-01-03",2.2,"Served warm. Pours clear. Aroma was a little tart citrus with a strong alcohol presence. Theflavor was similar. A little sweet with a slight sourness. Overwhelmed by a strong, but not unpleasant alcohol burn. Not bad, but very unremarkable.","Sarasota, Florida, USA","wildchefbill"
3181,"2004-12-20",2.9,"(750ml bottle, served at 65F, I assume this is the same sake, as it looks identical -- the only difference is the label says 15.6%ABV).  Completely clear liquid, might as well be water as far as appearance is concerned.  Aroma is another matter -- sweet, perfumy, orange, plum, alcohol.  Taste is sweet and alcoholic, fruity (orange, plum, berry), floral.  The warming after the swallow is very pleasant.  I acknowledge my ignorance on sakes, but I have no complaints.  This is quite acceptable, to the extent that sake is acceptable to me.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
3181,"2004-12-03",3.2,"average sake, very affordable. Mild floral aroma, smooth taste. Another inexpensive sake to keep for winter warming.","Oakland, California, USA","allphoto"
3181,"2004-12-01",2.7,"´What a great Hibatchi with a bunch of great people. Aroma was light alcholic and ricey. Pale light also with yellow undertones color. Tasted ricey, grapey and slightly alchol. Not a bad aftertaste. Ok.","New Jersey, USA","YogiBeera"
3181,"2004-10-24",2.7,"Warm, alcoholic aroma.  Clear appearance; dont really know what else to expect.  Taste was somewhat sweet but had a salty alcholic finish.  I think Ill stick to my beer.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"
3181,"2004-10-17",2.9,"Well, shoot fire!  I sure didnt know that you could rate sake on ratebeer.com.  I was just wandering around on the site when I realized that I could, and I just so happened to have some sake with my sushi this evening.  How can you possibly rate this alongside other beers?  Yes, tis difficult, but I shall try.  The aroma was light with tones of rice and alcohol.  The appearance was quite clear--very sake-like.  Not very beer-like.  The flavor was light with quite an alcohol bent to it.  I drank it warm at the beginning, but as it cooled, the alcohol taste became more apparent and made it less enjoyable.  This sake is best drank warm with sushi.  Overall, it was a good experience, but not one I would have often.  Purchase a small carafe if youre in a restaurant and share with a friend.  Then have a Singha.  Those are good.","Covington, Louisiana, USA","punkeedo"
3181,"2004-10-15",2.1,"Chilled. Pours pretty much looking like water. Smells like weak wine. Also smells a little like cherries. Tastes like sweet fortified wine.","La Mesa, California, USA","mjg74"
3181,"2004-08-28",2.5,"Clear, slight yellow hue. Earthy notes, alcohol, and coconut in the aroma. Hmm, flavors are mild. Some chocolate almost, earthy, and some alcohol. The alcohol isnt too much in the flavors. Trails off pretty smooth.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Sham"

3181,"2004-08-16",1.8,"UPDATED: MAR 22, 2006 Bottle.  Served room temperature.  Pours a medium thick looking rusty yellow, with some paler gold tinges around the edges.  Smells acidic, sharp and quite vinegary, but not nearly as dry as the Ozeki.  Flavor, however, is a different story, tons of sharp alcohol, huge acidic bite, the rice seemed rough and unrefined.  I could drink it well enough, but I would like some subtleties and less abusive alcohol apparency.  Good sharp finish however.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3181,"2004-05-16",2.7,"Matt (thedm) let me sample this beverage, my first sake.  This is fairly difficult to rate- it almost looked like vodka in the glass, with zero carbonation to speak of.  The rice provided a light, creamy, milky sweet flavor to a body that otherwise resembled and tasted like low-proof vodka.  Strange and not exactly appealing, although not terrible either.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
3181,"2004-05-04",2.1,"Aroma of white wine, pine and maple syrup. Clear with a pale yellow color. Sweet, some bitterness in the back, medicine taste, woodish, alcohol is overwhelming and burning. This was my first sake and it was no succes. Ill try more and will probably have to rerate this one.","Delft, NETHERLANDS","jbrus"
3181,"2004-04-19",2.1,"Served heated to 105ºF in a ceramic cup. The aroma is like soured fruit with lots alcohol and crumbling earth and clay. The impact is strong and unrefied. It's like vodka in water that's aged on dirt. Flavor is soft and dry. From the sake that you can get anywhere and is best served warmed (equivalent to ice cold beer: hides flaws), this is the macro swill of the sake world. Futsu-shu is the equivalent to table wine and this one can barely even hold its own in that category. Not subtle, not complex, not good!","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3181,"2004-02-09",1.1,"The alcohol burn is just about overwhelming.  The aroma is a mix of 747 jet fuel and chloroform.  You'd be better off moving to the hills of Tennessee and making your own sauce with a homemade still and a banjo.  If the occasion is right and this is heated, it can go down without a fuss and be somewhat enjoyable, though I didn't waste my time looking for nuances and subtle characteristics in this stuff.  Hope you like the photo I took at Sam's Wine (upper left).","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
3181,"2004-02-08",2.5,"Well, this is just a weird drink.  It is hard to comment on the way it looks, becuase it looks like water.  It smells like rubbing alcohol, and thought I have never tasted rubbing alcohol, I imagine it tastes the same way.  As this is my first sake, and it was served at 105 degrees, I have no point of reference with which to compare it to.","Rowlett, Texas, USA","flemdawg"
3181,"2004-02-01",2.6,"Served at 105 F, this bottled sake poured a clear body with no carbonation and no head.  It had a strong Ever-Clear like alcohol aroma and a burning alcohol mouth feel.  Thin on flavor, there was nothing much there but alcohol.  Might as well drink moonshine.  Some day I'll have to sit down and finish the bottle to see how drunk it gets me!  Wow!","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
3181,"2004-01-25",2.1,"Okay, this is my first sake rating and to be quite honest I have no idea what I am talking about. To me sake is just not appealing, but that is what I initially said about stouts and porters but now,... well.. that has changed so maybe in the future my sake feelings will change too. 

The drink is very clear with some organic hazyness. Imagine a solution of benzene, the nose smells like stale water with some alcohol in there. The taste is dominated by alcohol with wheat, roasted (slightly!) malts, almost butterscothch but not really. The mouth is alcoholic, imagine mouth wash (listerine).","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SubstanceT"
3181,"2004-01-11",2.3,"My first sake tasting - lets see what I can get out of this.
A bit flowery with a light dusty aroma.
White color with a slight yellow tint.
Chilled:
Light friutlike esters and a bit cloying ricewater feeling.
Burning petrollike aftertaste.
Mouthfeel like watered down wodka.
Warm:
Aroma definetly improves - nuts and caramel and a light flowery note.
Still a somewhat agressive estery/alcohol note in the taste, but nicer now that its warm.
Sherrylike aftertaste. 
Mhh its definetly not as good as the really expensive one I had last summer at Munichs only good sushi place last summer - too bad I din't take notes then.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","jonas"

3181,"2003-12-07",2.8,"smells like sweet rice, a bit of soy sauce (maybe my preconditioned stereotypes are speaking here....)a bit dry...  sweet candy start.  then a slightly sour rotten apple finish that sends plumes of alcohol into my nose.  the alcohol burn remains for a while.  good to enjoy while already drunk.  i couldn't sip a glass of this.  it's almost like a sour, flat cider with lots of alcohol.  this is the first time i've ever experienced sake....","st paul, Minnesota, USA","ztrvz"
