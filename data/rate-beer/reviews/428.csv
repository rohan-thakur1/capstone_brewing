428,"2015-08-04",4.1,"On tap at the brewery!!!!! Pours unclear golden amber with an off white head. Aroma is subtle at first, but then the soft and sweet pistachio malt blend busts through so nicely and pleasant in the nose. Flavors are quite the same in a great way, such a nice gentle balance of pure pistachios over the light malty sweetness.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
428,"2015-04-29",3.2,"EBF. Pours a clear golden with a small white rim that leaves nice lacing. Nose is of peanuts, feeling like its real. Taste is certainly of pistachioes and pretty much only that, even. Body is light and carbonation medium-high. Overall a weird concoction that is fun and even somewhat enjoyable. Quite an achievement!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
428,"2015-04-05",3.0,"Sample @ EBF.

Appearance: Slightly hazy golden with a small white head and little lacing. 

Aroma: Not super expressive. Pistachios forward with caramel and not much else. 

Taste: A tad sweet. Nuts, malt and hints of cardboard.

Palate: Medium body. Medium carbonation. Lingering nutty aftertaste. 

Overall: A small sample at EBF is definitely not the best way to judge this beer, but for me the pistachio is too present and hide the base beer, which is definitely not expressive enough to shine by itself.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
428,"2015-03-24",3.3,"Sample at EBF. Hazy gold pour, almost no head. Aroma is really malty, light corn, light pistachio aroma, fairly nutty. Taste is sweet, lots of residual nutty/malty sweetness. Palate is med bodied with light carbonation. Decent.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
428,"2015-02-17",3.7,"Tap: Exceedingly hazy burnt amber, nearly copper with a soft, creamy ecru cap that plumes up & settles slowly. Nice sheety lacing. Aroma of dry vanilla bean, kilned nuts, earthiness, toasted bread, modest creamy sweetness. Not explicitly pistachio but definitely a nutty aroma. Flavor of toasted nuttiness, freshly baked sweetbread, lightly toasted toffee malt, slight vanilla cream, & some drying yeast towards the finish. Medium mouth feel, a little creamy, a little slick. Finishing vanilla, toast, & nuts. Really enjoyed this one. Nothing too extreme, but solid, drinkable, & unique.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

428,"2011-05-31",2.3,"Reviewed from notes. 

Pours a moderate golden color with a bit of a brownish tint. Off-white head falls quickly with a few spots of lacing. The nose brings forward quite a bit of pistachio and the cream doesnt enhance the brew  it has too much of a diacetyl component to it, which is quite unfortunate. Some moderate cream in the flavor along with buttery toffee. The butter works a bit with the nutty notes, though everything is still a bit of a contrast. Medium creamy body with average carbonation. Very strange brew.

428,"2011-03-17",3.6,"On tap at Sunset for their Shorts event prior to EBF.  Pours a hazed gold.  Sweet ice cream and pistachio pudding aromas.  Smells pretty much just like a packet of Jello instant pistachio pudding powder.  I wonder if they used the same flavorings in this. Toasty, sweet pudding.  Sweet and nutty.  Quite tasty.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
