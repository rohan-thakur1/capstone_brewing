1892,"2016-05-14",4.0,"500 ml bottle bought at YATA in MOKO, Mong Kok.
Looks: Clear amber honey colour with a very thin layer of yeast particlesExplosive three and a half finger head with crumpety white foam which lasts for 3 minutes; Excellent sticky lacing with very fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and sweet Ale malt, with citrus peels, marmalade, light candied fruits, perfume, caramel, toffee, floral, molasses, light bread and grass.

Taste: Close to light sweet moderate Ale malt, with pineapples, light jam, strong caramel, toffee, strong grains, floral, molasses, light bread, light yeast, strong lemon, strong bitter hops and fresh grass.

Body: Mid to light body. Very slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Fairly good Ale maltyness in a slick and quite thick background. Light pineapple and jammy taste is nice and omnipresent. Good caramel and toffee, floral and nicely sweet. Strong lemon to round. Very pleasant!

Hoppiness: Citrus peels, marmalade, light candied fruits, perfume, floral and grass in nose. Nice pineapples, jam, floral, strong lemon and grass in taste. Bitterness is strong for a lasting, close to high astringent fruity malty finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Jammy fruity and bitter to mouth.

Comments: Looks like this one has lots of Pacificas influence to thank for, with the jammy marmalade aroma and taste so prevalent. Great looks and head, strong body, perfumey aroma, fruity ester and hops, and head strong citrusy bitter finish. This is a real treat and a great pair for meals.

Potent grapefruit and white pepper hops up front lead into a touch of lime. There is a savoury, toasty malt backbone, giving way to more lime, along with lemongrass and black pepper, in the finish, which leaves a nicely bitter aftertaste.

Right, in spite of my scepticism about IPAs, I was hoping this would be a lovely experience, but I had it in a blind tasting trial and the results were not too exciting. The colour was copper (and that one I DID see!) perhaps consistent with how IPAs were supposed to have been. Aroma was weak and rather undefined, but far from particularly pleasant. Not much of a hoppy note (and I am NOT a hophead). The flavour was that of a classic English bitter, malty, with a metalic clink to it. Sooty palate, not smoky, but dusty.

Lovely golden amber colour.  I often get a lemon (or could be lime) twist in this, great malty flavour but still fresh and crisp on the palate.  Arguably NZs best IPA.","NEW ZEALAND","tyrrell"
1892,"2008-10-09",3.4,"Review from old notes...
Served slightly chilled in pilsener glass. The aroma is strong and interesting to say the least; bread, wood, sweet cake, pine needles, hops in a teabag. Very different. Pours a clean mid amber body with offwhite lace. Body is reasonably light but satisfying. Flavour takes a while to get going but once it’s on it’s well and truely on! The hops are unbelievably fresh with a solid piney presense. Roasted malt flavours also come through the developing and lingering hop dominance, however the bitterness is only moderate. There is a hop in here i’ve been of witness before. Possibly Pride of Ringwood or Green Bullet but it has an unmistakable presence and pretty much dominates the flavour, not that that is a bad thing. A very unique, and very New Zealander, take on the classic IPA.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Quite subtle in aroma with some floral rose petal and perfumy hops, tangy citric fruits and a splash of toasted malt and sherry (?). Pine-nuts, sweet malt and grapefruit start it off as I took in its smooth, lightly carbonated and absorbingly pleasant mouthfeel. A few ever hastened sips later and I was worried it wouldnt last as the fruity esters took hold giving it a quenching, yet well rounded presence, and a late bitterness that seemed lost long into the swallow with some more soft fruits just ended it with precision and absolute drinker satisfaction.

Its more subtle on the tongue than the aroma suggested - light and malty initially, with a restrained tartness in the finish. Marginally under-hopped?

What would I do without Emerson's? Here is proof again that they are masters at their craft. The 1812 India Pale Ale is a beer whose qualities are as numerous as the number of bottles I could drink.

It's a beaut to pour - I was seduced by it's dance and the lightly hazy deep rusty amber colour. And what a head! A big mountain of tight, soft creaminess, it stays intact as it gently sinks - like a cream-coloured iceberg slowly melting in time-lapse.

And then the aroma hits: Smooth and round and of  sweet caramel malt with pears spiced lightly with cinnamon - it's like a dessert! Superb.

The taste is a big gutsy all-over-the-tongue bitterness with a huge slightly sweet fruity malt burst. It just feels luscious - thick and voluptuous. It's a manly beer with an earthy quality to it and leaves a wonderful dusky hop bitterness that begs for another gulp. Part of the head even lasted til the bitter end and gave a creamy burst to my last mouthful. Wonderful.

Fruity and creamy in the mouth, while still being bitter enough to count as a manly drop, this is my new treat beer. Even more than the pilsner! Can't wait for a hot summers day to sample this refresher with cheeses &  pasta in a spicy tomato pepper sauce, or quench the thirst after a hard day painting houses in Carey's Bay. I could get drunk on this and feel no shame. This beer makes me horny. Emerson's APA is out reeeeal soon! Stay tuned.","Dunedin, NEW ZEALAND","DiscoForever"

1892,"2003-08-27",3.6,"One question I have of antipodean brewers is why don't they look at the description of an IPA and give it a red hot go? An IPA is supposed to have an intense hop flavor and a moderate to very strong aroma. This is not assertive enough, but neither are the JS or mountain goats either. 
Having said that the beer is still a good one. The creamy copper colour is topped with an equally creamy head. When being consumed it is great to swirl the glass and see the two combine as if it were nitrogenated. The nose is a gentle fuggles/golding style hop and the maltiness is complemented by a toffee (tim tam) palate. The hopiness is noted in the flavour but I would like some more.

1892,"2003-05-11",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2006 reminded me a lot of the squire IPA - a spicy, nutty, prickly, relatively light-bodied IPA. Not hugely bitter or too sticky and crystal malty - very drinkable and balanced. Smells nicely of nutty munich malt and marshmallows (hows that for alliteration?). long tingly finish of toasted malt and spicy hops (fuggles?). very appropriate as i had just performed the choral version of tchaikovskys 1812 for 10,000 old ladies at the Superdome. rer8: fresher bottle from Dunedin was heaps hoppier (really peppery) and more bitter - it was like chewing hop cones.rer8+3years: very very good. bb end next year so must be fresh. lovely glowing amber. huge lumpy head that wont quit - orvalesque. hops seem to have been americanised a bit - definitely some NZ cascade now, as well as fuggles etc. as with other emersons beers, underlying malt is cruskitty. overlaid with caramel and tremendously tasty fruity esters - again, almost belgian. tropical fruits. well balanced, fresh, leafy bitterness unrolls and gradually dries out your tongue. this is really hoppy but its not aggressive - dry and aromatic and resinous but not like stone beers or anything. i am very happy they got this down at dan murphys now and i dont have to go to new zealand to get it.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"
1892,"2003-05-06",3.2,"At AIBA 2003. Orange with great head. Fruity aroma and start to the taste. Slightly spicy with some hoppiness without being too bitter.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mutant"
1892,"2002-06-02",3.8,"Appealing pale ale, with great hop bitterness on the finish. maybe its slight fault is that it lacks in body a bit, but there is a decent spicy hop flavour to it. Tasty as youd want.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
1892,"2002-05-06",4.1,"Mossy/earthy hop and nutty British malt aroma.  Nice golden-orange colour with a sturdy white head.  Piney, resiny hop flavour.  Bitter at first, mellowing out slightly in the middle before a lingering hop finish.  spot on!","San Diego, California, USA","Kaya161"
1892,"2001-10-08",2.4,"UPDATED: SEP 18, 2006 Brown-Gold in colour, rich aroma of malt, hoppy bitterness.
My first experince of South Island Brewer, not too bad

Rerate mild hop aroma woody oak flavour thin and flat very disapointing.","Waterloo, Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beerledgend"
