Taste has moderate banana and coconut notes. El Jefe is no German Hefe but it isnt a bad Florida version.","Orlando, Florida, USA","sloshgator"

1730,"2017-04-06",3.4,"12/10/17. On tap at The Lodge, HHI. Hazy golden orange pour under a small khaki head. I fucken love hefes and coconut, so I was excited for this one. Turned out to be not bad.

Head is small, frothy, white, with some spotty lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is murky medium amber. Flavor starts lightly to moderately sweet and slightly acidic, then finishes lightly sweet and faintly bitter. Palate is medium, slick with a soft to lively carbonation.

1730,"2016-09-20",3.5,"16oz pint at the brewery. Appearance: Deep golden and hazy, moderate white foam head. 
Aroma: Clove heavy, with a ligh banana bread. 
Taste: Starts with a sweet wheat maltiness, a light spicy clove and banana, and finishes with a moderately strong coconut to contrast the banana esters. 
Mouthfeel: On the lighter bodied side for a hefe, with a moderate carbonation. 
Finish: Leaves some pear esters and coconut after the swallow. Very pleasant. 
Overall: A nice take on a hefe with the added coconut for complexity against the fruity yeast esters. Maybe a little thin for the style, but still delivers a wide range of flavors and aromas, with the typically fruity yeast esters.","","TH28"

Its full bodied but light very flavorful and drinkable. A very nice take on a classic style. It is just a little different while still delivering everything you could want.

1730,"2015-11-19",3.6,"Sampled at GABF 2015 with Andrew, Mel and Frank. Pours a deep orange amber body with thick white lacing. Medium to full-bodied hefe with no cloying notes of clove or weird spicy banana character - just mango, coconut and tea. Really good, non-traditional flavor profile for a hefeweizen.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
1730,"2015-10-20",3.5,"Draft on tap at the OG Party (Miami, FL). Pours a deep darker amber orange hue, darker and hazy with some nice orange juice glow at times. Frothy whitish head with mellow layer atop, solid lacing as a decent ringer. Aromas are earth, dry, some banana and lemon mix into bready malts, wheat, and gentle yeastiness, subtle vanilla. Initial is fruity, lots of banana and subtle pineapple meet vanilla, bread and flaked wheat. Some sweetness, subtle spice, pie crust and yeastiness. Middle gives up body as those estery elements trail out. Some vanilla, faint honey, applecrisp, faint cinnamon and spice. Nice flavors, richer with firm pie crust sweetness at times. A bit full, sweeter at times but really fruity and subtle spicy at others. Interesting Hefe. Sweet overall. Fruity and potent nose, some sweeter flavors in the body.

1730,"2015-10-13",3.8,"GABF 2015. Lots of coconut flavor, some banana and bubblegum. Good, thick palate. I dont know about the coconut, I guess it works but this had enough quality as a regular hefeweizen it didnt need it. Big white head, they got the appearance right. One of the best American hefeweizens I have had in a long time.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"

1730,"2015-10-09",3.6,"GABF 2015. Cloudy yellow appearance with an off white head. Heavy banana and phenols. Vanilla and coconut. Moderately sweet. A little doughy. Its above average for the style but the yeast they use is awfully aggressive with the phenols and esters.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
1730,"2015-07-21",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2017 My Bottom Line:
Coconut and pears whip up an aromatic and different Hefeweizen, helped by bready yeast, wheat and cushy residual sugars.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the cloudy beige.
-Carbonation is very low, sadly. This lowers drinkability in this case.
-Coconut is beautifully harmonious with pear-banana esters.
-Texture once again is rather carelessly done here, which seems to be the case for most Wakefield brews. Carbonate this like a proper Weissbier and youll get something special.
-A touch of orange is felt throughout.
-The pairing with Asian, soy-based seasonings is fantastic!.

1730,"2015-03-17",3.0,"Ive drank a lot of Johns beers. This is the first time Im having one of his commercially brewed beers. Its merely ok. Too heavy a body for the style, and one note flavor wise with a popping bubblegum character. Lacks the complexity or consumability of a truly great hefeweizen (or the intrigue of something like Floridian).","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"

1730,"2015-02-13",3.7,"Draft on tap at the brewery after the Salesforce Higher Education conference. Pours a rich orange with big white head. Aroma is clove and slight banana. Taste is a very rich wheat forward hefeweizen with just a bit of coconut and definite banana. Im not sure if it is because of all the other fruit going on here but the banana was very apparent but very well balanced with the beer. Im not sure Ive had a better hefe in quite some time even though it is not my go to by any means.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"
1730,"2015-02-02",3.7,"Draft. Pours hazy orange with a white head. Fruity and yeasty, with quite a bit of estery banana notes, lighter spicy notes, mild sweetness, and a quick fruity finish. A step below some of the best German examples, but a damn fine beer, and a great base for the treatments. Very drinkable.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
