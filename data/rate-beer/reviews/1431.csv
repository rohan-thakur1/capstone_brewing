1431,"2009-10-30",3.9,"Poured from bottle into a Summit pint glass - seems inappropriate to drink Schells from a Summit glass, oh well.

Reddish-brown with persistent thin head; very little lacing.

Noble hops, metallic, dark fruits, smells good but a little faint.

Somewhat similar to smell. Reminds me of a roasty brown ale crossed with a Vienna Lager, but with a higher level of hops. Metallic bitterness, especially in the aftertaste, and the bitterness becomes more apparent after continued sipping.

This is the most interesting part of the beer. Smooth and clean like a lager, but creamier like many ales. Very little familiarity with Altbiers, but this makes sense as it is essentially a lagered ale. Medium bodied with a decent level of carbonation - almost spritzy. Ultimately, I am left with creamy but spritzy - very unique, a little strange, but mostly good.

This gives a creamy feeling to the beer which is substantial anyway.  Like the aroma, flavor is mostly  malt but with a nice amount of hops.  There is just a hint of bitterness felt on the very tip of the tongue.  Mostly, though, this is a sweet beer.  There are some subtle flavors.  Coffee and chocolate make appearances.

Medium / thin body with tingly assertive carbonation on the finish.  The taste is watery with dark chocolate malt.  The finish has an unpleasant spice and astringency.  Not good.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

My interest grew more as I became more familiar with alts, one of my favored styles. Ive also tasted Southampton and Erie alt. This 12 oz bottle has a cool label, though different than the other Schell styles. I am curious if that is Auggie on the front. Once poured into the steeler stein, the color is dark ferruginous brown and a froth of a thin tan head. Ubiquitous beer aroma laced with uncooked bread and roasted background hints. Not overly strong smell. Has a gustatory delight of roasted medium light bitterness. Feels like its trying to be a stout but never gets there with the choler overtones. Interesting and fun to drink.  Frabjous medium low fizz and carbonation, not watered down. Overall a fine example of a good respectable beer.  Finish has a short low to medium malt bitterness.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

1431,"2007-01-15",4.2,"Served at cellar temperature, and poured into my tall, straight-sided Gosser glass, this beer is dark brown with a huge frothy head of tan foam. The head bubbles down in a minute or so. Moderate lacing. Mildly fruity and chocolate malt in the aroma.

Nice sweetish chocolate malt flavor, not overly complex, and truthfully, not really ‘alt-like.’ A nice hop bitterness comes into play in the finish with some additional bitter roasted chocolate malt. Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel, prominent carbonation, and medium body. Very drinkable (he says after polishing off his second and looking for the bottle opener again).

Even though I’m not convinced its an altbier, I really enjoy drinking this beer, and have missed it during its absence. I am very glad it is back.

This is sort of like a stiff porter with much more of a hops balance allowing the flavor nuances of the malts to show through amidst the smoke. I taste lots of chocolate of course (bitter, not sweetened thank goodness). Also there are some caramel and perhaps toffee elements, And to top it all off there is, of all things, an element of citrus to the flavor - cant remember when Ive tasted citrus in a beer this dark!

Color is a dark brown, almost black, with a fine, 1"" creamy tan head. Aroma is largely clean and airy, but there are traces of cocoa and nuts. Hops are there, too, but laying low. On the palate, though, they reveal themselves in all their might. Big burst of fruitiness (bananas,and citrus, primarily!), that soon smooths out bigtime. The malt contingent is firm and swiftly becomes large and in charge. That doesn't stop an overriding fruitiness to continue to ride throughout the flavor and the finish.

1431,"2003-12-31",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 4, 2004 2/4/04 UPDATE: I have to say again how much I enjoy this beer! I bought what might be one of the last sixers in my area recently, since, as rumor has it, Schell is discontinuing this brew! This time, I found the body more thin to medium than my last impression. This is good, as it makes it seem much more alt-like. Great roasted malt flavor, though not overpowering. Did not seem like a porter this time. Who knows what I was thinking last time? Or maybe it was just a slight difference in batches or aging. Regardless, I'm holding on the remaining 5 for as long as I can--and keeping my eyes peeled for any remaining stock on the shelves. This bier tastes good, like a good alt should! PREVIOUS NOTES: Not much like the alt bier I once enjoyed so much as a three-year resident of West Germany (Konigsbacher Alt--I lived in the Traben Trarbach Hunsrucker reigion). That was dryer than this while retaining a lot of malt character. Which is not to say this is bad. It's just that this is more like some other style, like a porter or stout. Pours a dark rich reddish color with a loosely bubbled tannish top that subsides through the drink into clingly lace. Softly carbonated, creamy textured, medium to full body, slighlty caramel in flavor with suggestions of medium chocolate, a certain smokiness, a nice lingering dryness in the finish. Very good.

Feel is a light-medium body, quick thin start, quick thin finish. Nothing to overwhelming, its a very easy roasty calm beer that could be better in the taste but is still a good drinker, goes well with a grilled burger.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
1431,"2003-06-15",3.6,"Malty aroma, with hints of fruity, spicy hop, dark bread, and a very faint touch of caramel sweetness.  Deep, dark brown in color with a lasting, creamy, ivory head.  Nice balance of roasty, sweet, cocoa and bready malt flavors and the spicy German hop character.  Dry, toasty grain finish.  Very smooth consistency, medium bodied.  Recommended.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
1431,"2003-04-28",2.7,"I wasnt very fond of this beer. Its flavours were too strong and overpowering. After one i felt full and didnt look forward to another dark german ale. Too much barely flavour for my taste.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","gsmitty80"
1431,"2003-04-15",3.5,"As it sets in my glass a deep mahogany, almost an opaque brown, the head is commodious, the texture is creamy and light tan in color, as it erodes the lace formed is a thick and sticky sheet upon the glass. Lots of malt in the nose, sweet caramel, a tad peatish, fresh and appealing, the start sweet, and the top lean in its feel. Finish is stinging in its acidity, the hops pleasing to the palate, dry and lingering aftertaste, a quite quaffable beer at any rate.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
1431,"2003-02-10",3.5,"Nice dark caramel color and tan head start this one. Aroma is a little sweet and fairly nice. The flavor is nice and fairly easy drinking. A good beer, though lacking something to take it to the next level.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"
1431,"2003-02-02",4.0,"The best brew in Schell's lineup. Roasted malt aroma with hints of cinnamon & nutmeg. You could package this as a winter brew and nobody would think twice. Light brown head, mostly diminishing. Reddish brown in appearance. Nice lacing. Nicely balanced, good flavor. Recommended.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
1431,"2003-01-30",2.6,"A dark beer with a long lasting head.  Slight caramel aroma.  Very malty taste, it took me awhile to figure out that this beer has more taste and characteristics of a Brown ale than an Alt.  I could find none of the bitterness or bite associated with an alt.  Above average as a brown ale below average as an alt. Disappointing since I was looking forward to an Alt.","Ohio, USA","redlem"
1431,"2003-01-18",3.2,"Poured very dark ruby-brown with a cola head that was completely gone in short order.  Malty aroma but foreshadowing the metallic notes in the flavor.  The flavor has some other depth, including suggestions of something spicy and something Scottish.  Lots of malts, a bit of bitter chocolate.  Thin, watery palate with a bit of carbonation remaining.  Drinkable and decent, though flawed in some noticeable ways.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
1431,"2003-01-13",4.1,"Attractive dark red color, not much head, but the head is long lasting and solid. Slighty sweet malty aroma.   Very subtle chocolate taste along with malt flavors and a little bit of hops. This is a surprisingly interesting beer.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","Pjones6738"
1431,"2003-01-13",3.6,"Malty for an alt, to me it is better than the more bitter Dusseldorf style alts.  Just my opinion.","Prairieville, Louisiana, USA","joemacaluso"
1431,"2003-01-03",4.1,"The second bottle tastes even better than the first - but two is my limit. Serving temperature really influences this alt; I prefer chilled to refrigerator temperature, then left at room temperature for 10 minutes before cracking. Body is not as heavy as it looks to the innocents. This alt has a strong chocolate nose but is much more complex than the first impression. A friend of mine really loves this mixed with an American lager; about 50:50. I recommend this alt with many German dishes that include sausage. I really like the finish.","Minnesota, USA","BitterFan99"
1431,"2002-12-22",2.9,"Well I opened this one up and poured in to my glass.  Schmelled like new auto paint and then believe it or not like bananas.  Tasted like a strong caramel and a taste I cant put my fingers on.  I liked the overall taste but wouldnt want to taste it on a regular basis.","Sharon, Wisconsin, USA","awaller05"
1431,"2002-12-20",2.6,"worst of the schell offerings. overall its a drinkable beer, but poor ratings for trying to pass it off as an alt. too dark and dry for the style. had more of a dunkel lager character.","Evanston, Illinois, USA","Bierlieber"
1431,"2002-12-07",3.0,"An interesting beer, but not very complex. Pours out to a amber, almost brown color. Somewhat sweet with a light hop presence on the finish. I honestly can say I liked it but wished it were a little more flavorful. The Schell Brewery is a nice thing for the folks in Minnesota and the Midwest to have around.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","proc"

1431,"2002-09-11",3.3,"a very malty alt.  medium to thick palate.  dark brown body.  Roasted chocolate abounds, as well as a large amount of sourness (this, I did not like).  Some chalkiness ensues.  Moderate hops.  Nowhere near BlimpCity, but well done anyway.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
1431,"2002-09-07",3.8,"very malty aroma with a nice roasty quality...flavor is impressively roasted. didnt detect as much bitterness as other raters.","Davenport, Iowa, USA","igneous1"

1431,"2002-08-19",3.2,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2004 I have been waiting a really long time to try this, then the place in Jackson got it in. I think it's my first altbier.
Dark with really small bubbly head, lasting as a super thin rim. Thin-to-medium bodied. Dark choc malt in the nose, but awash with other malts as well. A bit sour through the middle. Good hop finish. I liked this...it seems complex. This first bottle I didn't even let get all the way cold, and I'm glad. Warming does the flavors justice. But, another one of these later I need to ask: is it supposed to have this lactic sourness?","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
1431,"2002-07-27",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2006 UPDATEII (August 24, 2003): Id heard that Schells was discontinuing this brew so I ran out and got another sixer.  Still the same great combination of tastes as Ive come to know & love.  This is one of my top beers, for good reason--nice palate,  great taste and it also looks nice in my trusty ale tumbler. I really hope they dont pull the plug on this! UPDATE:  The second batch I tried is even better than the first!  Lots of malt flavor with a follow-up of hops near the end.  This is great beer!

INITIAL RATING:  Id seen this stuff in the cooler at our local beer outlet for a long time but never gave it a go...now Im kicking myself for waiting so long.  This stuff is great.  Id never tried an alt style beer before so this is my first taste.  Because of that, its tough for me to compare it with anything else.  It has a nice, malty character without being sweet and comes through with a nice hoppy finish.

I really like it!","Wisconsin, USA","NeonLX"
1431,"2002-07-09",4.2,"Are there actually hops in this sucker? Its hard to tell because all you can taste are the malts. Thats OK -- this is an excellent dark, rich altbier.","USA","beerlovinman99"
1431,"2002-06-25",3.7,"This wasnt my favorite Schells offering for a long time.  I had at least one rough bottle and then my trip to the brewery didnt really change my mind either.  It reminded me a lot of my home made stout, before it was appropriately aged.  With so much malt it is easy to get wierd flavors.  I recently gave it another chance, or rather my husband brought home a six pack as part of showing off Minnesota beers to his relatives.  I think Schells has finally gotten it right.  There is no roughness, only smooth choclate malt flavor.  Yum.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","jennythenipper"

1431,"2002-06-03",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2003 Original Rate 3 June, '02 This is the beer that started my beer tasting quest many years ago, so it holds a special place in my heart/stomach.  Dark blown color with a dark cream thick head.  Chocolate and roast malt flavors along with a mind hop bitterness.  Very satisfying. Rating 8/4/9/3/19.  RERATE 30 Sept, '03 OK so my benevolence for this brew should be over.  I still enjoy this brew, but perhaps my praises are based on this being the epiphany of brews. Chocolate and green hops aroma. Rich and thick in palate. A bit thin in flavor with caramel mocha flavors dominating.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1431,"2002-05-30",3.0,"Very little aroma. Nice red-brown color, with small head - lacing. Smooth, watery palate. This was a bit sour (normal?) and had a coppery taste. Had some altbier character in the flavor, but was more appealing when washing down dinner, not sipped by itself.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"

1431,"2002-02-28",3.8,"I cant believe Id waited this long to try this one.  This is a little more choclatey than I expected, but it tastes good.
