3600,"2015-04-06",3.7,"(Cask pour) clear brilliant golden with a foamy white head. Lovely aroma that smells like a brew house on IPA day: loads of barrels of earthy chewy hops, a bit of wet cement, leafy resins and a backbone of toast malt. Lovely smooth flavor with golden malts and a bit of toast with a smooth and balancing leafy/grassy/citrusy hops. Really smooth and quaffable. And just bitter and dry enough to please on a sunny day.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

3600,"2013-03-02",3.6,"Cask at Hogshead - listed as ""Denvers Pride Premium Best"" - glowing dark orange - this was dry hopped with Delta, and the hop seems a bit potent and spicy, making this drink more like an APA - a surprisingly bitter/hoppy brew for this brewer - however, there are some lovely, dry, earthy, whiskey-ish malt notes and a bit of sweet toffee and brig fruitiness through the middle - spicy, bitter finish - still quite good, but I will have to try it again soon with a different dry hop.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
