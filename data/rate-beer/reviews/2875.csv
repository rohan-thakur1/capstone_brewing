2875,"2017-06-08",3.9,"330 ml bottle. Pours a dark copper with a yellowish beige, quickly disappearing head. The aroma is very lightly yeasty (dough), bready, beeswax,, some faint herbal hop notes and also settled notes of fermented pears. Full body with a low carbonation, a medium sweetness and a light bitterness. The alcohol is very well integrated. The taste is very malty, caramel, honey, brown sugar, meaty, hints of overripe fruits, but the sweetness is perfectly balanced by a nice hop presence (again with a somewhat generic herbal hop bitterness, bitters). Finishes with a light pleasant alcoholic warming. Overall complex and very smooth to drink - a really good beer.","AUSTRIA","PowY"

Aroma dulzón, a pesar de que al contrario que otras del estilo no contiene azúcar añadida. Mucho menos ningún tipo de aditivo químico. Es decir, malta de la mejor calidad (siete tipos diferentes), agua pura de subsuelo rocoso y lúpulo. Aparecen también matices afrutados en su aroma.

En boca tiene buen cuerpo, es como esa sensación cuando estás degustando un buen vino. Se perciben notas dulzonas (aunque menos de lo que su aroma presagia), caramelo y frutas maduras, ciruelas pasas. Se aprecia también madera quemada y un poco de café muy a lo lejos . Quizás incluso algo de chocolate puro.

2875,"2016-10-15",4.8,"La simplicité est la clé de toute véritable élégance » disait Coco Chanel. Cétait avant. Lors de son défilé, lAbbaye des Rocs présente sa miss Belge éponyme. A peine lescarpin posé sur le tapis que la nouvelle brune laura démentie. Chevelure fine et disciplinée, elle porte une robe de couleur brun foncée, tirant sur le rubis par leffet des jeux de lumières.

Le défilé est millimétré : 7 sortes de maltes et 3 types de houblons (belge, allemand et tchèque).

Ses matières premières, de grande qualité, permettent doser la corpulence dans lélégance.

A premières vues, notes chocolatées, caramélisées et de pruneaux. Sentiment de puissance et de force pour cette dame au parfum aromatique complexe.

Nullement potiche, la verve qui lanime est à son image : richesse et finesse se développe au fil de la discussion, plutôt dense. Ladage voulant que ces dames choisissent leur parfum à leur image a prouvé sa justesse : son léger caractère brûlé complète ses traits de personnalité de maltes sucrés et caramélisés. La douceur chocolatée ne fait quadoucir la puissance sans pour autant lui enlever sa force.

Dame onctueuse et riche, son côté pétillant lui permet de persister à briller sous la lumière.

Cette dame a donc démontrée quil est tout à fait possible dallier élégance, profondeur et puissance, en toute complexité.

Preuve que les brunes ne comptent pas pour des prunes, la brune pur malt simpose aujourdhui en haut du podium.

2875,"2016-07-21",4.1,"Data ważności:  21.04.2018 
 Kolor:  Brązowy z czerwono-rubinowymi odcieniami. Nie jest do końca przejrzysty. 
 Piana:  Wąska, lekka, praktycznie niewidoczna. Przy tak wysokim wysyceniu znika z sykiem w oka mgnieniu. Milimetrowy krążek otacza górną warstwę Trappist Glass.
Śladowe ilości piany na ściankach. 
 Zapach:  Aromat jest na prawdę pierwszorzędny. Słodki, słodowy z wieloma warstwami zapachowymi. Pierwsze uderzenie było w klimacie czekolady, odrobiny kawy i kakao. Gdy tylko zniknęły te składowe pojawiły się kolejne w postaci orzechów włoskich, karmelu i toffi. Daleko na zapleczu lekka paloność. 
 Smak:  W smaku Brune jest kompletnie inne niż w aromacie. Odnajduje tutaj więcej czerwonych i ciemnych owoców. Jeżyny, ciemne winogrona, rodzynki i aronia.
W kolejnym łyku pojawia się toffi i karmel i delikatny brązowy cukier.
Co pewien czas piwo przypomina młode wino gronowe.
Przy następnym łyku na podniebieniu osiada trochę miodu.
Fajne musowanie na języku. Goryczka niewielka, słodowy finisz.
Faktura gęsta, ciało pełne.
Słodkie, gładkie, ale wcale nie mulące. Wibrujący, ciepły alkohol równomiernie rozchodzi się po całym ciele. 
Żywe wysycenie podbija pełnię.
Wysokoprocentowy trunek, ale o pokaźnej pijalności. 
 Wysycenie:  Wysokie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Abbaye des Rocs uwarzone zostało jako czysto słodowe piwo. BEZ DODATKU cukru.
Użyto aż 7 rodzajów słodów i 3 rodzaje chmielu (belgijski, niemiecki i czeski).

Wzorowy przykład Belgian Strong Ale.
Perfekcyjnie wyważony, doskonale zbalansowany i bogaty zarówno smakowo, jak i zapachowo.
Najbardziej zaskoczył mnie aromat który miał akcenty czekolady i kawy. To nieczęsta sugestia w przypadku BSA. 
Aromat i smak łączył w sobie masę słodkich nut: toffi, karmel, kawa, słodkie owoce.
Należy jednak pamiętać, jak już wyżej pisałem, że nie ma tutaj grama cukru!
To jest fenomenem.
Piwo pełne, gęste, wyklejające usta i podniebienie.

Dodam na koniec, że za piwo zapłaciłem 7,8 zł.

Taste: same notes as in aroma but with more prominent alcohol warming, quite sweet, some more dark caramel, gentle roast, nonexistent bitterness, honey-strawberry taste that I adore from the aromatic malt. The rest is the same and quite interesting, complex.
medium body, creamy, slick feel, lively, long sweet finish with some lingering aromatic malt, dark fruits leftovers. Equisite.
Overall: A sipper with amazing complexity, I can see coming back to this beer for more, despite its significant alcohol warming and sweetness which are not really faults but move away from the typical belgian ""drinkability and slight dryness"" of dubbels/brunes. Apart from that the presentation is its only fault due to the significant gushing and resuspending of the yeast.","SLOVENIA","pitch992"

There is a nice thick ring of light khaki head and a little bit of bubbly lace as it falls down. The aroma it is a little tart. There is a nice maltiness to it. There is a good bit of brown sugar and a little spiciness that really comes through on the back end. Its nicely balanced, with a hint of tartness that I cant really place. The flavor is very bi-directional. Its sweet and carries a light dark fruit up front and it morphs through to a ton of breadiness. It finishes like a Belgian strong should, but there is just bready malts. I was hoping for a little more complexity in this one. The mouth feel is pretty decent. There is a nice thick creaminess to it, but it is a little over carbed. The aftertaste is bready and carries a little malty spice to it. This one could be great, but the chunklets just take too much away.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

2875,"2015-01-03",4.0,"Bottle from Wine of Galilee in Tallinn. Deep dark brown colour with a hue of chestnut or mahogany. Head is massive initially but drops fast to leave a good layer and some thick lacing. Nose leads to believe that this is going to be quite sweet - its got a lot of caramel and toffee, but also a deep woody spiciness (kind of like caraway / cummin seeds and cinnamon), also a red berry tartness. Cant believe theres no added sugar here... A bit of an alcoholic note as its warmer. Taste is very sweet malts - again, so hard to believe its actually sugar-free! - that are somewhat taken over by moderate bitterness and fruity and bread crust sourness, then they mix to create a very nice chocolaty, cinnamony and bready finish with a tingle of warming alcohol. Body medium, carbonation thin but active, palate very soft and creamy, while the finish is somewhat malty dry. A fine, complex beer!","Tallinn, ESTONIA","Kauge"
2875,"2014-12-28",4.9,"This strong ale showed a dense pour of a cloudy and intense reddish body letting loose tons of very fine bubbles with a vivid and thick hazel head sitting on top of it all. It showed a fair amount of retention and lacing but I would have expected more to be honest. The nose is very nice offering complex notes of floral hops, soapy yeasts, butterscotch, maple syrup and even some grainy malts. Not bad for a brew with no added sugar to develop such a sweet aroma. The taste gives away roasted and sweet malts almost imitating moka. There is a good balance between sweet and bitter that lets you enjoy even the taste. The warmth of the alcohol is perceptible and closely followed by a hoppy finale that wraps it all up in a very distinctive tasting experience adding a appreciable aftertaste. The mouthfeel is dense, oily but also sharp and vapory proving once again the complexity of the product. Overall this is a very well crafted beer that I strongly recommend not only for its quality but also for its complexity that will charm the connoisseur as well as the rookie since its very delicate and accessible.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Beardbeerman"

Warm, toasted malts at the beginning, which turn more present and sweeter at the same time. Carbonation is lively, vanishes soon, due to the intense malts. Interesting development on the palate, as the beer starts earthy, bready with hints of wood and rather dry, the malt needs a second to turn sweet and warming, with hints of fruit and also spices. Almost too sweet aftertaste, sticky. Refreshing at first, loosing its carbonation to the sweetness.

Pours huge head which slowly dissipates. Deep brown colour. 

A huge smell of both dark fruits and caramel sweetness. 

Sweet fruit and spice with notable Belgian yeast. Toasted, sweet malt taste is quite special. The level of raisin and brown sugar complexity that you would expect from a quad! Very little alcohol taste except for a small amount of warmth towards the back of the palate. 

Smooth body with medium carbonation. 

Really punches above its weight; up there with the quads! Far better than a good few of the Trappist beers too - an essential!!

2875,"2013-05-14",3.9,"33cl bottle BB 01/2015. Extraordinarily balanced triptych of (South-)Belgian brewing: rich, deep, complex dark and red fruit tastes (figs, prunes); heavy caramel malts and heavy-duty yeasts levitated into near-imperceptible, round and mature 9 ABV; grassy and herbal hop bitterness working in accord to provide a strong and spicy back drop for these fruity yeast chords to bounce off. Smoother than, but faintly reminiscent of Chimay Bleu, in the same enlightened league as St.Bernardus Prior 8.

2875,"2013-05-06",4.2,"750 ml bottle served in a St. Bernardus snifter. 

A: Poured with a thick creamy light tan head on top of a reddish-brown body that has lumps of dark soft solids floating about. Not appealing, but seems to have no nasty effects on feel or flavor, and settle to the bottom anyway so that they could be avoided ... that is, if the beer wasnt so darn good youll want every drop. Still, a downgrade on looks which remains high due to the stellar head and lacing.  

S: bready-fruity-floral aroma, with hints of cumin, orange juice, and champagne. Some additional, more earthy and less attractive alcohol esters. 

Taste: rich, even given the aroma, and mainly fruity and spicy, although the flavor is subtle and complex.  Making appearances are raisins and dates, dark bread, coriander, cumin, ginger and orange peel. Theres a faint hint of smoke in the aftertaste.  This beer is rather sweet but the bitter/sweet blend seems on the spot.

I had expected a bit more from this beer, but I do have a cold and a light sinusitis, so I might have myself to blame... The taste is moderate sweet and light bitter. Quite strong flavours of sweet sugary dark dried fruits and vanilla, further back I get caramel, Belgian yeast, dark candi sugar again, perfume and a whiff of banana.

2875,"2013-02-22",4.7,"Colour: cloudy, hazy translucent deep wine red and purple tinge with flaky yeast sediments.

Appearance: Excellent two finger head with lasting beige foam and very frothy; Excellent, sticky lacing and fizzy carbonation.

Smell: Very fragrant aroma of dark fruit and floral which can be smelt half a feet away once poured; Aroma includes plum, raisin, banana, vanilla, malt, liquorices and light alcohol.

Taste: very nice sweet and hoppy taste of strong raisin, plum, banana, caramel, toffee, yeast, cloves, light alcohol and herbal hops.

Yeast sediments: they are chunky and grainy, so its optional to pour them into the glass but I did, which makes the tasting much more rustic, tasty and enjoyable. In fact, the yeast is so sticky to the grass it looks like cinnamon powder on cappuccino and I have to scrape them with a dessert spoon! :)

Body: Mid body, slick palate.

Mouth Feel: taste profile is dominated by nice and light alcohol as background with long sweet maltyness followed by light yeast (from sediments) and cloves, and ends with nice floral and herbal hoppiness at low dose typical of Belgian ales.
 
Hop Bitterness: mild and comfy - is manifested throughout the taste profile not just at the end, a very nice feature!

Booziness: the 9% abv sounds daunting, but unlike other BSA booze bombs, this one works up ever so slowly. It doesnt kick in long after 30 - 40 minutes. It has a simmering feel more than anything else. Excellent!

After taste: Slightly dry, very nice and easy to mouth.

Comments: After Chimay Blue, this one is another stand out winner in the sea of BSA. It has beautiful head, rich yeast sediments, nice and strong fragment aroma, rich taste profile, excellent booze management, tasty hops, rustic yeast character, and I can go on and on. The lack of creamy palate as in Chimay Blue may be a minus, and that doesnt change my opinion to place it as one of my top 10 brews. Highly recommended. Do I really need to say that? ;)","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

A: Light brown to dark orange in color, with a half inch of white, fluffy head that leaves a healthy amount of lacing. Some sediment can be seen floating in the beer.

S: Distinctly Belgian aroma, with scents of Belgian yeast, malt, fruits.

T: I was shocked by this beer. It was delicious. I will definitely be hooking myself up with some of this. A tantalizing Belgian yeast flavor in tandem with subtle fruits and a wonderful malt profile make this beer utterly delectable.

M: Smooth, creamy, and slightly sweet. Silky smooth on the palate. Age must have come into play, as this beer is just effortless to drink.

2875,"2012-06-29",3.3,"Poured into a goblet. Best before 2010...oops. 

2.0 A: Fucker gushed on me big time. Dark brown color. Unthinkable amounts of yeast particulates and floaters throughout. Big frothy tan head. Retention is below average and no lacing is left. I know this would look much better if it didnt gush, but it did, and my score will reflect what I got. An ugly ass brew if Ive ever seen one.

4.5 S: The aroma, on the other hand, is quite fine. Perfect balance between sweetness, fruit, earth, and spice. Toasted malts to start this one off with a subtle nuttiness. Raisin and date fruits. Woody earthiness. Pepper spiciness with clove undertones. Sweetness from candi sugar residue. Well balanced with all the flavors in perfect harmony like any of the world class Belgians.

4.0 T: Taste is almost as good, but it seems hollow at times. Toastiness, nutty, earthy, woody, pepper and clove spice, raisin and date fruits. This is much drier than the nose suggests and I think a little more sweetness is just what this brew needs. That extra fermentation is likely the culprit. A little more maltiness would really balance the taste. Still, its very good.

2.5 M: Light to lighter medium body. Good spritzy carbonation and a pleasant creaminess. This could easily be a 4.5. But, it isnt because all those floaters are really offputting. I cant help but think Im drinking vomit every time a clump of something passes over and tickles my tongue.

3.5 D: While still very enjoyable, its clear to me that I need to find this brew fresh. In an unadultered form, I bet this is fantastic. When I do track another bottle down, Ill probably re-review.

Serving type: bottle

2875,"2012-06-28",4.5,"Gusher alert! The result is a deep, unclear burgundy brown with hints of copper and beige foam, some small yeast particles floating in it.
The nose is powerful, a mix of alcohol (red wine like), plenty of sugars, roasted malts and something spiced - very, very nice and promising.
That promise is fully delivered in the taste which is very similar; strong attack, definitely alcohol but not excessive since the other flavours are equally present. Some sugars but more roast and above all spices. The end result is really complex.
The aftertaste tends more towards roast, smooth but not soft, quite malty in fact. A touch of bitterness brings further balance.
If you pour the yeast, it seems to add further punch.
Delicious brew!","All over Belgium, BELGIUM","Noctilucus"

2875,"2012-04-08",3.6,"I wanted (yet) another St Bernadus Christmas on tap, but the strength was just too high so I settled for a bottle of this on that fateful afternoon I first visited The Red Rose in Brugge (Dec 2011).

The 9% ABV being a whole 1% less than the St Bernadus I felt very righteous and the wife didnt notice the alcohol content (double bonus).

Nine tenths of the beer was poured for me into the glass, the remaining sediment infested tenth I swallowed at the end. The beer was a deep, deep brown, red, purple colour, mostly red I suppose: on top an off-white head that fades fair too swiftly.

The smells are mostly sweet: molasses and sugar on toast, there is also a yeasty, dirty aroma hidden away that comes out when the beer begins to warm in the glass.

This isnt a gulper; youve got to sip it: the flavours are complex and confusing. Sweet up front with a malt flavour, leaning towards burnt candy floss and treacle tarts as you get into it.

Rich, but not as thick as you might imagine, certainly different to what I expected.

Wonderful, fruity and tempting aroma. Sweet and airy, plums, liquid brown sugar, red apples, plums and raisins, light yeast and a bit of old. Very nice - not spectacular but exactly what I needed. Addicting flavours kept me from reviewing until this point. Initial light yeast spice that holds half the way through but near the bottom it really hangs around. Brown sugar, raisin, plum, spice, maybe a hint of anise, light earth, wonderful sweetness that is perfectly balanced with slightly sour here and there, dark malts, goodness! Medium bodied, never noticed the 9%, very smooth, I think the after taste has been short lived because I havent stopped drinking the big ass bottle.

There is a ton of shit floating around in this brew.  I have to admit, I am somewhat hesitant to try it.  The nose has notes of apple and pear cider, spice, yeast, and mace.  The flavor is surprisingly chocolatey with a good bit of sweetness and complexity.  A subtle berry fruitiness combines with the chocolate notes to make a very flavorful brew.  There is some vanilla and port qualities that come out as it warms.  The alcohol is there but not overwhelming.  Really quite good.  Medium to rich in body with lots of reasonably smooth carbonation.  Definitely a different kind of brew.  Major points for the flavor but major points off for the look and feel.

Served in a wine glass. Gushed quite a bit, overflowing after I opened it. It was probably a bit too warm. Loads of floaties, though this is quite explainable given the gushing. Pours brown-garnet with a moderate head that quickly falls into a collar with a speckled cap. The nose is strong, earthy red grapes with some caramel and plum in the background. there are also some other dark fruits and a good measure of sweetness as well.

The taste is not quite as complex but there are strong grapes and a bit of cherries. This is quite sweet but never cloying. There is a bit of darker malt in the background; no roast. The feel is medium and cream. Light--though very fitting--level of carbonation. Incredibly drinkable. Likely my new go to Belgian beer.

An interesting combo of fruitiness and the classical ""bruin"" feeling makes Abbaye des Rocs Brune a pretty interesting abbey ale. Particularly, the black currants in the aroma and the fruity hints of raspberry-ish berries in the taste are both perfectly blended in with the rest.

To be fair perhaps this beer was aged too long (though that would hardly seem the case) as it was aged around 2.5 years.

Appearance isnt that great either head retention problems for sure and massive floaties are everywhere in this beer. Tasting the beer yeilds more and more booze followed by sweet and spicy yeast notes that are typical of Belgian beers but this one just seemed over the top. Significant sugars all over the place that dont seem to blend well, body is fairly thin for the style, and on top of that you get a distrubing feeling everytime one of those floaties grazes your teeth.

A - Dark murky brown with a lot of sediment floating in this beer. Large light brown head with pretty good retention.

S - Dark fruit and sugary smell upfront. Also some spices (Cinnamon and pepper). Along with the dark fruit there is some malty/caramel scents.

T - Fairly sweet between the dark fruit, dark sugar, and malt. Balanced a bit by some of the spices in this beer. There is a bit of nuttiness to the taste as well. Alcohol is pretty well hidden although it gives off a fortified wine kind of taste.

M - Probably would be medium bodied but relative to what I would expect it is a bit thin, decent carbonation though.

D - Really tasty and would like to drink a couple of these. Only thing that is holding that off is the ABV, and that after 2 or 3 it might be a little sweet.

Pours a dark reddish brown color. Cloudy with huge floaties. Large frothy head with good head retention and some lacing, though the glass seems to be coating more by floatie sludge than last. Aroma of earthy malts, chocolate, brown sugar, bread, crayons, light fruit notes including cherry and apple. Taste is decidedly more fruity with definite notes of cherry, berries, apple, apricot. Also brown sugar, yeast, toffee, spice and almost sherrylike notes. Full bodied. The floaties definitely make their presence known on the palate. Very soft carbonation.

Aroma is more subtle than i anticipated, but i did get malt, candi sugar, and dark fruit.  Taste, however, is an explosion, with malt up front dissolving into dark fruits such as plum, date, raisin, and lighter fruit like green apple.  Finishes smooth and sweet.

Been wanting to try this one for a while and its certainly a wonderful Belgian strong ale.

Pours a light murky brown with TONS of chunks & floaties....not just at the bottom of the bottle...right from the very first pour.  More than Ive ever seen before.  Small tan head that dissipates to virtually no head and doesnt leave much lacing.

Malty, sweet, and very fruity.  Runs the gamut on fruit flavors from sip to sip.  The standard dark fruits such as raisins and figs, with notes of tangerine, banana, grapes, and apples.  Absolutely delicious!

Alcohol is undetectable in the taste.  Mouthfeel is wonderful...creamy but not syrupy with a nice finish.

2875,"2009-03-28",4.2,"750mL bottle poured into a snifter, after getting this gusher under control.

Pours a slightly murky reddish brown that shows amber when held up to the light.  There are plenty of floaties in there and the head is large and lingers for quite a while, leaving a little bit of lacing.

The aroma is big with tons of sweet dark malts and lots of dark fruits, especially raisins and figs.  There seems to be a molasses sweetness as well.  There is a bit of an alcohol burn in the nose as well.

The taste was great, much like the aroma.  Tastes like raisins soaked in a highly sugary alcohol.  The malt base is still dominant throughout and though I mention the sweetness, its definitely not overpowering as in some versions of the style.

The mouthfeel is velvety smooth with plenty of carbonation.

This is a nice example of a Belgian brown, one of the better Ive had recently.  I definitely feel lucky to be able to walk into my local shop and pick this up whenever I want.  Good stuff.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Nose  is quite vinous, red and dark fruits in abundance, supported well by sweet caramel & toffee malt. Palate translates well, with the fruit a little more reserved than on the nose.

Sampling notes:
Served lightly chilled in chalice.
Plenty of yeasty chunks floating in a deep bronze body, capped with an offwhite foam that is thick and likes to hang around.
Vinous aromatics, dark fruits and berries, earthy spice, hint of raisin and liquorice, maybe even a touch of bitter orange. Some malt in background, fortifying the nose, dark brown sugar, light roastiness, possibly a touch of grainy wheat.
Lucious malt body, smooth, chewy syrup consistancy, huge length, low carbonation, somewhat balanced by a drying alcohol/wheat-like sensation.
Big malt body gets the ball rolling, milk chocolate, brown sugar, nuts, then hit with raisins and blackberry fruits...would make a tasty chocolate bar. Palate continues with spice, tobacco leafiness, more dried fruit (date?), which linger on a moderately bitter, slightly drying without being boozy, finish.
Funnily enough I had memories of two other beers whilst drinking this...the original Belgian chocolate ale we brewed, and a Chimay Bleu of a few years cellaring...the latter seems a good way of putting it. Really well rounded, and lengthy palate, but after trying three of this style in a reasonably short space of time its easy to be choosy, and this fantastic ale is the lesser of the Rochefort 8 and St Bernardus 12...by only the slightest of margins!","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Flavors follow suit, sweet caramel notes deepened by dehydrated figs and dates, and balanced by lightly spicy, earthy hop notes.  Creamy, bready yeast bridge the gaps well.  Medium-full, smooth, almost silky on the palate, the 9% ABV is well concealed.  Not nearly as complex as some have made it out to be, it’s simply a nice Belgian brune.

More malt than gc also helps balance the aggressively spicy abbaye profile. Palate similarly avoids the fizzy overkill of gc; its a perfectly smooth example of full bodied carbonation.

2875,"2008-07-20",3.8,"33 cl bottle. Loud pop when opened. Large light brown head which took some time to settle,(not much of lacing though). Color is somewhere in the deep brown region with lots of bubbles (could be some red in there...). Aroma is pleasant with a mixture of yeast, bread, caramell and a faint scent of green apples. The body is full and rather creamy and the high carbonation can be well sensed. The finish is nice and warming from the high alcoholic content, which otherwise isn’t so obvious. The flavor is rather sweet, though well suported by a nice bitterness. Aftertaste is pleasant and lasts long but after some tasting the aftertaste becomes a bit sour.

Pours a dark mahogany/brown color with crimson hues. Regular head with good retention, it leaves a nice ring.
Aroma is complex, malty/yeasty/spicy with a great diversity of smells. Wood, caramel, toffee and macchiato coffee are the first things that come to mind. Black olives, apples, clove and christmas cake are less obvious but clearly present when you dig deeper. Some fruit tartness rounds up the aroma of this brew.
The flavor is pretty round too, bittersweet, toasted. I taste coffee grains and loads of caramel, nougat and whiskey creams. The tartness of blueberries and fruit gums. Complex and full of subtleties, but not overly intense as expected. Surprising.
Palate shows a medium body. I could do with a little more. Alcoholic warming sensation. Fair carbonation and the finish and aftertaste are some of the best Ive ever tasted, and the latter lasts for hours. Great beer.","Hanga Roa, Easter Island, CHILE","Panzerfaust"

2875,"2008-06-28",3.6,"750 ml bottle. Somebody or some entity did not want me to rate this beer. It has eluded me for years. Twice I have bought the Abbaye des Rocs Grand Cru, mistaking it for the top rated Abbaye des Rocs brew. The last time was last weekend at Bottleworks in Seattle. Luckily, I had a notion I bought the wrong one again and called tennisjoel from the parking lot who set me straight. Luckily the store clerk allowed me to swap it out despite the Grand Cru bottle having spent several minutes in the bright sun, which is sacrilege in the dark store that is Bottleworks. When I finally sat down just now to open the bottle, I had the hardest time opening through the black foil and ended up cutting my finger on the cap. Like I said, somebody or something didnt want me to get this brew. Of course, there wasnt much of a carbonation sound when opening the bottle and the head is flat, so I hope I didnt get an old or flat bottle!!!!! Smells rich, sweet, Belgian and somewhat sour. Lots of complexity in the aroma. Beautiful cloudy darker brownish red. Whispy head gives way to no head. Yup, this is flat. Im telling you, Ive had the worst luck with this beer. The label says best before 2010. So, two years before its best before date, its flat. Im thinking the cap had somehow been compromised, which may be somewhat tougher to do with the foil ""seal"". Regardless, very disappointing to have lugged this bottle home from Seattle to Minneapolis only to have it be flat.

I can tell that with carbonation this would be a pretty darn good brew. Plenty of flavor and good balance. A pitty to drain pour Abbaye des Rocs Brune.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"

Its predominant drawback is its lack of depth - there is little flavor on the back end, and incredibly little complexity to this beer. Pours nicely - a great dark ruby color, though the head was reminiscent of soap bubbles. Weak aroma of malts and fruits, and a flavor of plums, sour cherries and sweet malts. Im now incredibly curious to try blending the aforementioned beers to see if I can create a better version of this one. Really not a bad beer, but it gets knocked for not living up to its rep.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

I have honestly been looking for this beer since I joined the site and I have found the Grand Cru to be a bteer example of the style. My bottle was totally flat. Not sure if I got a bad one or not.

2875,"2008-02-25",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2008 Thanks to franksnbeans for this one!

Poured from a 750ml. bottle

Paired with country-style beef platter.

Aroma: Nice sweet smell (caramel?)

Appearance: Very thick, insistent head (nearly 3/4 of the glass). As it gently recedes, flakes of yeast swim in the dark, copper body. Reminds me of a tiny snowstorm in my glass.

Flavor: Sweet tasting, almost nutty & caramel-like with a chewy type aspect.

Palate: Very smooth, malty feeling in the palate.

Overall: The taste belies the alcohol content as it was easily drinkable. Shared the bottle with my wife and could have easily had the bottle to myself. Love it. I was a bit hesitant at so much yeast, but i was told its a good sign of a belgian beers freshness & didnt interfere really with the taste. Drank on a cold, winter night, something about the sweet & maltiness seemed comforting. Definitely a winner!","Carignan, Quebec, CANADA","papat444"

The flavours shares the same sweetness and fruity esters and added notes of charred wood in the finish. The malt complexity is great. Suggestions of brown sugar, orange peel, pear, cherry and noble hops. Most notable about the mouthfeel is that you can actually feel the particulates sliding past the lips and over the tongue. The body is thinnner and less carbonated that anticipated, but is still velvety smooth with a nice warming of the throat. The finish is dry and slightly phenolic, as it is fragrant and mildly spicy.

The aroma is on the sweeter side and has a lot going on it including cherry, raisin, caramel, some light spiciness, and various dark fruits.  The flavor is strong and complex.  It contains flavors of lightly caramelized malts, fruits and berries, dark bread crust, some delicate spiciness, and hints of roasted malts and coffee.  Like most good Belgian beers, the aroma and flavor or quite complex and difficult to put into words properly.  Some slight bitterness appears in the finish, but then it receeds to leave a nice, sweet fruit and malt flavor to linger on the tastebuds.  There is also a touch of tobacco as well which is a nice comlexity.  The alcohol is just barely noticeable as it mingles with all the other flavors.  It definitely doesnt bite or burn.  This beer has a medium-full body and is really smooth on the palate.  This is an excellent beer and probably the best Belgian Brown Ale that I have had recently.

All I notice of the aroma at first is that signature Abbaye de Rocs red wine/vinous/sour grapes smell, but it unfolds more as you let it sit.  Theres some toffee, butterscotch, and the smell when you first walk into a coffee shop (its better than coffee ever is).  Simple enough to describe, but how it all comes together without being messy is pretty awesome.  Taste follows suit, with the butterscotch and cocoa flavors at first, followed by that vinous red wine character, some dates, and cherries.  Finishes with an initial spice flavor of cinnemon, cocoa and licorice fading to a woody hazelnut aftertaste.  Slightly buttery too.  Subtly bitter, but maybe its just dry...Medium to full bodied, totally polished smooth texture, high carbonated, but its where it should be for a beer like this.  Another great de Rocs beer, possibly better than the Grand Cru, but Ill be revisting that one soon.  A perfect marriage of red wine and stuff youd find at a coffee shop.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

Very refreshing aroma with some tart green apples, citrus, chocolate, and lots of spicy and doughy yeast.   The flavor is perfectly middle of the road sweet for a belgian ale, some banana, very yeasty and spicy.   Finishes with a lot of hops for the style, and they perfectly balance it out.

Mellow velvety chocolate malt, apple, sultana and earthy dankness. Lurking hop pepperiness wafting gently with booze. Fruitier and more strawberryish aromas emerging as it warms.

Abbaye des Rocs Burgandy Ale pours (on the first pour) a clear mahogany that glows when backlit. A one finger dirty white soapy head formed on the pour and immediately fell to nothing but a collar. Leaves a spot of lacing here and there as the beer disappears.

The smell is a little off-putting. Almost smells like this beer is infected but the flavor is good. Smell is sour mixed with wet cedar. This beer was stored upright from the day it was purchased but I cant help but think the cork has something to do with the smell. As it breathes the sour and woodiness start to fade slightly. I pick up faint hints of plum and caramel...As the beer breathes the pick whiffs of caramel come through and dark fruit abounds. 

This is an extremely malty brew. The sweetest creamiest caramel you could imagine creates the backbone of this beer. Plums and raisins make their presence felt adding another layer of complexity. Slight underripe banana. My descriptors of this beer just dont do it justice. Seems the off aroma did not affect the flavor at all.

The mouthfeel is extremely lush, velvety and smooth. Body is on the heavier side with a slight grittiness on the finish. Luxurious mouthfeel.

This beer is one to sip and enjoy the complexities but I could see myself sipping the night away with this beer. Very easy going down.

A high quality brew from des Rocs. I could only imagine how good this beer would be if the smell wasnt off. Next bottle I buy the rating will be updated if the aroma is better (like I expect it to be).

There is a very doughy, bready nose with hints of sourdough, citrus, banana, and dark spices. There is rich bread throughout the flavor with hints of chocolate and spices. The finish reminds me of a molasses cookie with bread, bananas, and citrus fruit. The biggest turn off here is that I can actually feel the giant yeast particles hitting my lips and teeth when I drink. Its like pulp and I want to chew it, which is weird.

Some chocolate, spicy alcohol in a good way, stronger caramel, though the lemon seems to switch to a mix between orange hard candy and orange rinds.  Overall fairly sweet, but has a dry finish.

2875,"2007-04-29",4.1,"750ml bottle, with no best by date. This one was a bit of a gusher. Thankfully I opened it near the sink, and only lost a few ounces.

Pours a dark caramel brown with a frothy two finger head, with only an eight ounce pour. The foam takes forever to fall to a thick cap, leaving behind a thick sheeting of lace.

Smell; chalky yeast up front, and then becomes fruity with figs, dates and plums. Brown sugar, caramel and bread dough give this a very nice malty aroma.

Taste; theres lots of dark fruits in here with the figs, dates and plums, but theres something else in there I cant quite place. Some cloves and spices fill out the middle, and then tone of sweet caramel and brown sugar malts come out. The finish is a bit chalky from the yeast, and the alcohol has a definite presence as well.

Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a nice smooth natural carbonation. The drinkability is really good, and the only real complaint I have is that it is a touch sweeter than I would have liked. Overall this is a reall damn good beer.","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"

Thanks to hezron for bringing this to a tasting.  I was suprised to discover that it is not a Top 50 (or even Top 100) beer based on the bottle we opened.  Perhaps it was just an aberation but while still a very well made beer it does not do enough to stand out from the rest of the Belgian strong ales to make it one of the 50 best overall.  Still, I was glad to give it a try and would not turn it down in the future if offered.
Aroma / Appearance - A foamy billowing head settled into a half finger cover protecting the blood orange tinted body underneath.  The nose was very unusual - ginger and nutmeg stand out in a crowded field that also contains cherries, oak and a nutty profile.  It reminds me a little bit of Christmas.
Flavor / Palate - A peppery sensation floods the senses.  When that settles, it is succeeded by an oaky nutty feel.  The mouthfeel is dense and creamy but seems to lack something to put it over the Top into 4.0+ range.  This is enjoyable and very well made but just falls a bit short in the end.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

A saison-esque aura full of bold yeasty peppers and some glissandos of lightly oily wheat malt. Over juice browned bananas comes a touch of basil lead. Then a rush of ginger, mellowed with time and maybe some crystallization. More peppery phenols. Grains of paradise kepts drawing me back to an earht humid musk that lingers in the air like a stagnant tropical day. Ginger articulates as if it thinks its hanging out with Eccentric Ale.

2875,"2007-01-13",3.9,"Well, I have to kick myself a few times for making a rookie mistake. Ive tried to not let the numbers reflect the fact that a bad pour sent the yeast into suspension, causing a chunky mess to be poured, even in the first glass. My problem was due to the relatively long neck and my one-handed pour while holding my snifter-type glass in the other hand. This caused a bit too much forward lean on the bottle and a resultant glug-glug of air trying to get out of the too-full neck. The turbulence made for a messy beer. Nonetheless, this bottle obviously had a huge amount of sediment. Beyond that, my bottle was obviously past its prime, fairly vinous and oxidized. Despite this, there were some great caramel flavors, sweet toffee-like chewiness, a great, light-tan head, and other enjoyable qualities. Too bad I only had one bottle!","Reno, Nevada, USA","grease"
2875,"2007-01-13",4.1,"Served at cellar temperature in an oversized ballon-type wine glass. Pours a clear reddish brown with a good 3"" of tan foam. The color changes to a somewhat orangy hazy brown (about the color of Lipton iced tea from the bottle) over time. The thick foamy lace lasts throughout. Thickest lace I can ever recall. Fruity malty aroma, with some sugary sweetness in there too. A scent of alchohol - maybe rum.

Slightly tart with a full malty flavor, a taste of dark stone fruit is in there, along with some fig and brown sugar. Something reminds me of the skins of dark plums. Subtle yet complex. Moderately hoppy, a bit more bitter than most Belgians, but not unpleasant. There is a bittersweet aftertaste around the edges.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"

Starts to foam out of the bottle and pours a hazy red-brown with a medium sized head (small, given the foaming upon opening) that is realtively short lived. When I look at the bottle 5 minutes later, foam is slowly oozing out, and continues to do so until I cap the bottle with a rubber stopper. 
 The aroma is very interesting - molassas and dates, plenty of ginger. The flavor is a rich and fascinating somewhat-sweet belgian ale, with dried fruit swirling around background hops, honey and lots of spice and creme brule and an ever-so-slightly sour hop finish. The mouthfeel is lovely, full-bodied but not oily or sticky, carbonated but not overly so, rich but not hot. 

All in all, its an excellent beer but perhaps not the world-beater that it could have been given that its ranked considerably higher than the astonishly good des Rocs grand cru and tripel imperiale.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

2875,"2006-12-13",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 8, 2007 BB 2008.  Pours an opaque, deep garnet-brown with floaties; head is moderately full, off-white, fizzy, but creamy, with decent lasting ability and some nice lace.  Aroma is sweet and fruity; brown sugar, nutty toffee, raisin, plum, a berry-like character that is unusual, and some burnt wood and spicy whisps of alcohol.  Flavor is of the same, brown sugar, plum, raisin, light berry notes, and burnt oak, with vanilla, as if from an oak-aged barrel.  Palate is soft to lively, nearly chewy and a bit syrupy with a medium-full body and a mild alcohol warmth.  Overall, its a bit too sweet and lacking the exceptional depth of the great Belgians.  Nice and enjoyable and worth the try, but nothing in comparison to the Grand Cru.  

After another try, I did like it better but still lacks the multiple layers of flavors and the numerous amounts of floaties detracts from the appearance and the palate.  The beer remains still a bit too sweet with the only note keeping it from being cloying, the burnt oak note which is not the most pleasant note.  Nice and quite unique but not one of my favorites of the style.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

I shall make the attempt, nonetheless: jasmine and gardenias, cherry/blueberry, herbal-grassy hops, bubblegum wrapper, perfume, burnt caramel, new cigar, fig, vanilla, rum, banana a list by no means inclusive. The heady fragrance is so bewitchingly erotic that it reduces ones intellect to babbling incoherence. Articulating the savory whirlwind of ensuing flavors proves an equally baffling tasksweet and fruity, candylike, kiwi and chocolate, licorice, pie crust, rosemary, Meyer lemon, 7-up, allspice. Simultaneously uplifting and humbling. The beer crackles with random exploding bubbles as it passes the lips, and fizzes into a rich symphony of taste that osmoses into every surface of the mouth, tongue, and throat. Numerous gelatinous floc-blobs distract from an otherwise flawless texture. Flirtatious alcohol expresses itself as a blossoming glow of euphoria.

2875,"2006-08-29",4.2,"Bottle from Secret Santa (thank you) Pours a red/brown color with a prolific head that lasts forever (you will finish this beer and then want to drink the remaining foam). Aroma is complex, fruity, sweet with caramel and cooked plum, raisin and fig. You could spend an hour smelling this beer and still find new things with every wiff. Flavor is equally complex and malty with a touch of wood that was not presant in the aroma. Absolutly wonderful, subtle, refined yet strong and dominating beer.","new albany, Indiana, USA","daalamar"

Finish is very pleasant with nice and light tingly hop taste/feel.  9%!?!  Hard to believe this is so strong given the feel.  This one gets better the more you drink.  Not my typical style, but I really do like this one!","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"

2875,"2006-08-06",3.4,"Very dissappointed in this, considering its status and price ($11, 750). Bottle is best by 2008, so Im guessing this is a 2005. I almost wonder if the quality of my bottle was a little off, considering other (top raters) ratings of this brew, although recent ratings are quite a bit lower. Aroma is restrained, plum/sugar/zucchini/alcohol, unassertive and quite boring. There is maybe a touch more complexity and punch in the flavor, with a richer taste reminiscent of other ""belgian barleywines,"" slightly sweet under the funky fruity malts and belgian yeast. Pour was also pretty sad, with a big head that is gone within seconds. More flavors include leather, asparagus, some mild spicy hops, vanilla icecream.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

Further down the bottle the mouthfeel gets a bit thicker, the dark fruits and alcohol become even more apparent.  Alcohol is never in the foreftont, but hard to completely hide at 9%.

2875,"2006-03-04",3.5,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2006 Belgian Burgundy Ale. I can recognize the quality of this beer but it is not my thing.  There is a huge malt nose with light fruit, and more malt in the sweet flavor.  But there is another odd, sweet flavor to this beer.  I dont think it was from having an older bottle because it is a flavor I recognize from their other beers but didnt work out so well in this one.  The yeast strain, maybe?  But this is a very well made beer.  It looks great; dark red and lots of sediment as well as a thick and long lasting head.  Very heavy palate.  I do have a newer bottle and will give it another try.  -------- 2006 labeled as Brune this time.  This beer was as gusher and I lost some it it when opened.  Few beers have as much sediment as this.  Still underwhelmed with the simple flavor and aroma and lack of complexity in either.  It doesnt have enough going on to be scoring so highly.  Sweet malt, some light fruit, and that is about it.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"

2875,"2006-02-27",4.4,"Bottle. Pours a dark amber hue with a huge, rocky beige head. The aroma has tons of raisin and plum, some sweet chocolate notes, dark honey, and earth. Wow, the flavor is delicious. At first it is pine, raisins, caramel, and pistacchio. Then a nice, woody yeast tone takes over; it reminds me of freshly baked raisin bread, but with a distinct, sharp citrus twang over it. The finish is just a little bit dry and ashy, and quite vinous. There is also a distant aftertaste of chicory and bergamot orange. It also leaves a spicy tingling on the tongue for a few seconds. The mouthfeel is full, yet bubbly. The best part, though, is the harmony between all of these elements. Really, separating them doesnt do the beer justice. I am very very happy about this one.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

The flavor is fruity highlighting raisins and plums. Nicely sweet. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Creamy mouthfeel yet it avoids being cloying. Outstanding balance and a real delight to drink.

2875,"2006-02-06",2.9,"Ptt, pttoey, what happened!?! Ill tell you what happened, damn thing over heated and it werent me to be pointing fingers at. Can you rate a beer that had floaters reminiscent of high school pranks in which you gammied in a fellows drink!. Not my first tasting of this one, but undeniably one I had waited long for to rate, holding (without my knowledge) a dead bottle in the cellar for more than a year. Once cracked, the bottle livened and released foam so i quickly tilted the glass towards only to find globs of phlegm-like yeast packs bobbing out the bottle and into the glass. Woeful to look at, I sieved it through a sparge strainer into another glass and hoped for the best. Deep, almost pungent vinous nose, lightly doughy with a warmth reminiscent of Nannas year old fruit cake on the stove before serving. Light sweet cherry notes give a softness with a little spice to make it interesting. Impressed as the aroma seems unhinged. Similar in the mouth to the aroma; quite vinous like a red wine fresh from the fermentation tanks prior to ageing, it seemed a little thin and unworked. Has a strong hint of smoky malt that engulfs the dark fruits on the palate and gives a good balance to the sweetness of toffee, and burnt sugar that offered a light astringency in the swallow. Finish is long, dry and dominated by roasted, almost woody malts and dark fruits. Mouthfeel was creamy, yet lifeless from the perished sifted carbonation.  Left a year with yeast that had stopped breathing, so to speak had left this sample short of being terrific. Though I am still surprised that it didnt taste half bad. Definitely one to try again.

I think I pulled some muscles and Im gonna be sore tomorrow.  Naturally, when it came out it sprayed everywhere.  Needless to say, when poured it was extremely carbonated.  Enough to keep the massive amount of yeast circulating in the glass for 20+ minutes.  Pours brownish copper everlasting white head  Aroma is very yeasty and woody with a little dried fruit.  Flavor is quite awesome.  Fruits and belgian yeast.  Very well blended.  Alcohol well hidden.  Reminds me a lot of Unibroue Maudite.  Palate is not as carbonated as youd expect.

I get all sorts of malty flavors on the tongue including caramel, toffee, and sherry blending with a nice spicey hop finish of woody tones with touches of smoke.

2875,"2006-01-09",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 26, 2006 01/09/2006 - Abbaye des Rocs eponymous and showpiece beer provides enough proof to warrant the brewerys self-proclaimed ""wannabe abbey"" status. Once youve tasted the beers produced by actual Belgian monks, it seems presumptuous to advertise such immediate quality - unless you can actually provide it of course. Abbaye des Rocs appears to fulfill the requirement by having elaborated a set of reputable brews, namely the one I mention here. However, I hope to taste a few more so I can make a judgement of my own on the rest of their lineup. In appearance it reminds of the Grand Cru version, pouring a murky copper tint that puffs a fluffy custard head. The nose is initially heavy on bread and yeast conjuring the warm matutinal feeling of walking by the bakery. Sweet malts appear soon after, evoking honey, light caramel, brown sugar and honeysuckle while pear, citrus, peach and pine aromas give it a slightly fruity and hoppy foreground. The flavor surprises with its vigorous overburnt toast character. Caramel, grapefruit, orange peel and yeast blend creating a nutritious sensation that tastes less sweet than you would expect. On the tongue it feels somewhat syrupy at first but the texture becomes creamy and smooth as it moves to the back of your mouth with the discrete tingle of carbonation. An excellent palate and an excellent beer as well, though it would benefit from added complexity in the flavor. (8/4/7/5/16:4.0)


10/06/2006 Re-rate: I couldnt pass up a chance at an aged example of this wonderful brew. Gingerbread, acacia honey and brown sugar are prominent upon the nose added to cinnamon, nutmeg, artichoke, caramel and wood. A truly wonderful aroma that translates onto the palate with a distinct tropical twist. Mango and passion fruit are emphasized along with cappuccino and burnt toast. Subtle notes that I probably didnt pick up in my earlier tasting showed a great amount of complexity that pairs ideally with Abbaye des Rocs always sumptuous texture.

2875,"2006-01-06",4.6,"So before I have even opened the 750ml bottle, I looked around for the skinny on this brew, and how my curiosity has been piqued.  Best before 2007, but I can get more!  The head erupted out of the bottle.  Hazy red-grapefruit hue.  The two fingers of creamy white head hold an aroma of figts, cinnamon, sugary sweet breads and slight raisins.  As the heads dies down, aromas of caramel and wood, tart apples and bananas.  Sweet Caramel malts stand out on the first sip.  Sugar and wood.  Raisiny port and citrus.  Fantastic velvety smooth body with a lingering head that adds a creamy texture to the beer.  Ok, second glass.  A little more musty than the first.  And citrus.  Nice alcohol warmth.  Multiple layers of flavor.  Sweet, then tart, dry, citrus.  Third and final glass holds big sediment.  Darker and thicker.  Still musty but more bread and port.  Full and heavy in the mouth.  Starting to feel sugary and sticky, cloying.  Cookie note, caramel, slight pine, lemon, oranges, esters, figs (after three glasses, sorry for possible redundancy).

The aroma is dark, ripe fruits, raisins, prunes, plums and some spicy, yeasty aromas. Maybe some Burgandy.  The mouthfeel is large. The taste is sweet at first with dark, ripe fruits followed by some light alcohol notes, some light bitternes, and an almost creamy mouthfeel that finishes with a lot of taste and a nice, mild alcohol burn.

This beer pours a reddish copper color with a thick viscous tanned head which absolutely exploded out of the bottle and awesome layered levels of lacing. The aroma was very typical of an exceptional strong ale with raisins, vanilla, malts, brown sugar and marshmellows extremely apparent. Another in a series of beers that tastes just like a smore. Raisiny and marshmellowy sweetness. Very long-lasting and developing palate and finish. Full bodied and tickling carbonation levels.

The aroma is thick and vinous, with a distinct gingery character. It has some of the Christmas cake characteristics of the Speciale Noel, plus burnt sugar, peppery young shiraz and a hint of oak. Like all the best strong Belgians, it has an aroma that you can lose yourself in for an age before you take that first sip. The mouthfeel is faultless - full and creamy. The initial flavour impression is of raisins and toffee, sweet but not overpowering, before that magnificent late surge of warming alcohol. It has a spicy bitterness in the finish that is never overpowering. Sadly, the local supplier had just two bottles left and I promised the other to a fellow RateBeerian. What was I thinking? Fool!

The bottle was a very slight gusher and the head filled half of my Duvel glass.  I was anxious to try this beer that has somehow eluded me for so many years, so I took a sip of very cold beer through the foam.  Big mistake as it was all mineral, vinous, and harshly dry.  Once it warmed to a more reasonable temp, I got down to enjoying the beer.  Very mild aromas, much moreso than I thought Id find from such a highly regarded brew.  Some butterscotch, fig, honey, sweet tea, dried orange rind, mild cocoa bitter-sweetness.  Nice balance all around and yet perceptively complex.

Initial mouthfeel is frothy over a medium body.  Taste is sharp - strong malt sweetness and strong alcohol.  Lots of pepper and spiciness abound in the middle and it finishes with a delicate hop touch.

Medium brown, hazy, with all sorts of particules floating about. Powerful bouquet, reminds of a scotch ale, intimidating.  Excellent in the palate, a great example of power welded nicely into a balanced, smooth, almost elegant structure. Sure its malt driven but never gets too sweet or cloying.  Pretty hefty at 9% but youd never know such is the balance.

2875,"2005-03-14",4.6,"3/7/05.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, bought at Toronado in San Francisco, CA 9/4/04.  2000 Vintage.  Deep  red-orange in color, clear appearance with very active carbonation (fantastic for any beer, much less one that is going on 5 years old).  Truly a great surprise after all these years.  Aroma has a musty, dusty, aged and slightly woody quality.  Faint sourness, lovely fruits and softness.  Head is dense and uniform but fades really low; light tan.  Deep, rich prune and raisin; wonderful medley of dried fruit.  Beautiful soft body, medium-full with perfect carbonation.  Finish dries up with faint tartness and almost dusty, chalky prunes, wonderfully dry with subtly roasty dark malt aon the back of the finish-- sits up nicely against the fruit.  Black currant and chalky alcohol dust.  A superb, superb beer.  Ive had this 00 vintage three times (and this was my last bottle)-- I tried one back in September with FlipBrewerSF and some non-RB friends at the Toronado, and that bottle was so amazing (I told Flip I was going to rate it a 4.8, and he called it a 5.0) that I bought two more bottles to go.  Now I wish Id bought the whole lot of em.  A second bottle that I brought to the GABF RB tasting wasnt near as good but was still very enjoyable-- too fruity and sweet, but Id have rated that something like a 4.0.  I was nervous about this one, but it absolutely appeased my fears and has me yearning for other finely-aged des Rocs classics.  No protein drop or sad signs of aging to speak of-- despite a soggy cork that looked ominous, this bottle opened with a pop and never let up or gave off anything undesirable.  Simply delicious.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

Thin tan head atop a mahogany body that was filled with yeasty floaties, and some cork pieces that I picked out prior to consumption.  A candy aroma, much like a sweetart, and also cherries, malty carmel, and alcohol as it warms. Sweet fruit taste up front followed by an almost baking chocolate type bitterness.

Large yeast flakes are present floating in the beer. The dark color and the masses of floating flakes kind of took away from the appearance, but the giant head, lacing, and head retention were outstanding. Aroma is of orange and a strong red wine. The malts dominate this beer giving it a thick mouthful. The flavor of this is similar to a heavy red wine, as well as having a spicey orange taste. Pineapple, plum, and fig were also noticable in the flavor. This beer finishes rather dry leaving you wanting another sip. This was a really heavy beer.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","eboats"

I have been smelling this for the last 10 minutes without tasting it at all. I am truly in awe. Oranges, caramel, cherries and freshly chopped soaked wood along with some grainy notes and a citrus kick. 15 minutes later, I am ready to move on to the next step. 

This is a lovely tasting beer. Its quite odd really. Chocolate, caramel, cherries, plums, oranges, wood and oranges are all present but are dominated by plum pit notes. The bitterness at the end is well taken. The 9% is noticeable but not offensive. 

The sweet malt and candy aspects of this beer is amazing considering that no sugars were used at all.

After drinking this multiple times since its been in NC, I feel that this beer has somewhat degraded in quality.  It is still an amazing beer, but it no longer is my #1 beer.

Cap and cork are removed and the prey is sighted, the creamy nodule of foam that peeks from the neck, waiting to escape from the green bottle and into a worthy glass, eager for my consumption.
Cast in a gorgeous garnet color, cherry red, a sumptuous sight, the foam a lovely thing, all lace, all bubbly.
Nose is velvety soft, angelic, sexy. This aroma is a herald to beer nirvana, beautifully yeasty, happily hoppy. I reel in orgiastic delight, sent from the ecstacy of it all.
We sip, and the tastebuds are enticed, excited, set aflame, aglow, tossed back, and laid low...a graniloquent effect, indeed.
Magnificent maltiness! Abundant fruitiness! A symphony of rich, rounded flavors rings loudly through all corners and corridors of mind, body, and soul.
Sip after sip, a massive power sweeps over, wave after wave...magniloquent, effervescicant, scintillastic, etherealistic...Im left inventing new words to truly transcibe such transcendence. 
Like soaking in happiness, trading in your every cell for burgundy bubbles and floating into unearthly ecstacy. The very thing to judge others of this style by, Does it flood the mouth with flavor?
Does it devastate the senses?

Aroma is of crispy pine notes, lemon rinds, tropical fruitiness, pale earthy wood and dirt, candyish melons and more fresh fruits. Quite an inticing nose, albiet, its soft, hardly overpowering in any sense, very subtle and pleasantly so.

Taste is a wonderful array of tropical fruits, well rounded, lush, and full of candy-like fruitiness thats quite ripe, not sour, nice juices interminging across the palate. Banana, mango, dark orange, pineapple, grapes, and perhaps more to this fruit salad. It works its fruity magic for a good bit before the finish sneaks up bringing light wood pulp, hoppy herbal spice, and a super fine easy dryness. As well as some residual sugars and fruits lay way in the back late in the finish.

Very fine mouthfeel, full, smooth, well rounded, with a fluffy carbonation thats biting and warm in just the right amount nearer the end, never uneven, and seems to almost thicken up as it goes, like a really nice chocolate.

Spicy (cinnamon, nutmeg), woody, toffee, chocolate and slightly oxidised (though it was BB2006) aroma. 
Light, almost thin body with a corresponding drier, less malty flavour than many big Belgians. This makes a really nice change, however, and works beautifully with the spiciness and dark fruit flavours. A bit too fizzy in the mouth for mine.

2875,"2004-02-28",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 26, 2005 (Re-rate, 0.33l bottle) Very nice, deep, dark red color with a large head and lots of big yeast particles on the bottom. Extremely malty, sweetish and toffeeish, raisiny, rye-pudding aroma, even sweet-imperial-stoutish and port-wineous. The flavor is extremely malty, sweetish, almond-liqueourish, quite bitter-hoppy. Port-wineous, liqueourish - but pleasantly so, full of rye-pudding and spices (orange peel, licorice, etc.), plus a hefty fruitiness. The palate is quite full-bodied, warming, somewhat foamy-carbonated and sweet - but bitter. Some alcohol can be felt, but its definitely not dominating the flavor. An excellent, full-bodied, yeasty, very malty and tasty brew. Succeeds nicely in combining scotch ale, abbey dubbel and imperial stout. This must be the brew to die for, if well aged!
(0,75l bottle, was 6-4-7-4-14=3.5) Nice, murky, dark amber color with medium head. Sour, slightly sweet aroma. Quite alcoholic, sweetish flavor. Soft and full-bodied palate.

The aroma is sweet and malty with some apple tones, a bit of spice in the back end as well. Flavor has elements of chocolate, dates and raisins. Not as cloyingly sweet as I anticipated. Mouthfeel is velvety smooth and luxuriant - not something to rush through. The 9% abv is hidden extremely well - careful - it can catch up on you.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
2875,"2003-10-26",4.3,"Dark amber with red-apple hues in the light. Frothy, lasting, off-white head leaves behind some nice lacing. Incredibly aromatic, notes of cider, brown sugar, yeast and candy sugar. Very silky and thickish on the tongue; carbonation was amazingly soft and tight (god, you'd think I was describing a part of the female body). Sweet, cake-like malts with some toasted notes. Bitterness is mild, but balanced. Hops seem to mostly provide a spiciness. Fruity and yeasty notes throughout: spiced apples, pears, plums. Finishes a little sticky, but not overly cloying. Great beer!","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
2875,"2003-10-17",4.7,"The beautiful deep amber/burgundy body is topped by a thick off white head with a good amount of lacing left behind.  The only draw back to the appearance was the large floaterd the showed up after about half the bottle was gone.  The aroma is sweet, malty and caramelly with a very slight flowery note, some fruitiness and the slightest touch of alcohol.  The malty flavor is sweet and fruity with notes of caramel and the slightest touch of alcohol.  Just an incredible flavor.  A tear cam to my eye when the bottle was empty.  Full bodied, surprisingly smooth yet tingly on the tongue and slightly warming.","San Diego, California, USA","Vac"

Thanks RateBeer for pointing me to ales like this one.","Bedford, Texas, USA","TChrome"
2875,"2003-10-15",4.1,"Medium to large head that diminishes to a thin layer that never dies. Aroma of dark rich fruit, sweet maltyness, and a hint of alcohol. Flavor of rich fruit, caramel and an alcohol burn that blends with the sweetness to bring a slight spicy flavor. Only good when room temp. I tried it straight out of the fridge and was afraid I would be disappointed but after it warmed it turned out to be a very nice beer.","Silver Spring, Maryland, USA","jeffin7"
2875,"2003-10-14",4.1,"Hazy copper hue with a small but tight off-white head and good lace. The aroma hints of sweet fruits (apple, cherry, apricot, plum), toasted bready and caramel malts, hazelnut and earthy yeast. The taste started fruity sweet then developed a undertone of mild bitterness and espresso twang. The mouthfeel was grainy and full with just a touch of alcohol present on both the palate and finish. Overall, an outstanding brew with nice complexity and warmth. Not a smooth and rich as the Grand Cru which I slightly prefer.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Medium watery body & carb, well-balanced.  Mild sweet start. Big malts punctuated by alcohol, a little fig, and bit of barley or wheat grain. Nice hops flavor toward a medium bitter, dry finish. Light bitter & sweet nutty after. Very nice beer for under $2.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"

First word that comes to my mind: PEACEFUL. This beer is ultra-smooth and peaceful. Very candyish bouquet with sweeten barley, honey fruitiness(peaches, pears, grapes, cherries, orange, mango. There is just too many things to say that its undescribable. Medium body, Creamy candi sugar in mouth, licorice, bubble gum, subtle malt games, good vanilla touch and hoppy bitterness very noticeable (unlike alcohol that is somewhat harder to be found) and balancing this could-have-been-cloying masterpiece. Complex aroma to dream of, but not so intense. Its the most impressive with this fine brew, it preaches through its extreme balance, complexity, but its not.. ""arrogant"" and showing off with explosive aromas, everything is controlled and subtle. That brewer must feel good about herself. High rating, fully deserved. I owe you one MartinT.  Lowering it a bit since its more variable than Id like. Still a favourite of the genre for me, but the genre is no longer a favourite. From 4.5 to 4.2","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2875,"2003-10-06",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2004 Pours a murky caramel brown, however, there are some drab brown tinges in there as well. Pretty dark stuff.  Smells fairly stiff and pungent, but not overly aromatic (wow, i guess I am on my own here, though I did have a cold, I'll have to sniff some more of this soon!).  Alcohol noticeable.  Small fizzy brownish/yellow head.  Bubbly and moderately clouded.  Initially was quite carbonated and that added a harsh element to the palate.  Beer begins with big hops flavors mixed in with lots of dry caramel and lush raisin.  The caramel malt flavor continues to build up on the palette, growing sweeter with some chocolate covered cherry appeal towards the finish, maybe some raspberry in there too.  Finish is soft and warm, some small hops flavors detectable, and a very unique roasted peanut flavor is faintly detectable.  Moderately astringent flavor up front is my biggest problem, but as the beer warms and breathes, this dies off somewhat (though it never really loses its dry, loose initial flavor).  More hops would help out up front, though the main body is medium full and perfectly malty.  As I finished the bottle off over the next hour or so, it just got better.  No cloyingness, great depth and still tastes great at almost room temperature.  I definitely need to try terrible and then rerate the des Rocs Grand cru as well.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Malts are bready, fruity and sweet. Touch of spiciness. WOW There is a lot of competing flavors going on in this beer. Its mostly sweet malts, but there are hints and flavors of raisins, apricots, oranges, chocolate and toffee. Very smooth and mellow tasting. Excellent beer. It hides the 9% alcohol very well. Finish is incredibly smooth. Note the bottle I tasted had lots of stuff floating around in it, but it did not detract from the taste at all. Mouthfeel is very full and round.

2875,"2003-08-31",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2006 I just cant get into this brewer.  Decent deep orangey brown color, rapidly collapsing head.  Aroma of cooked green vegetables.  Uh-oh. The flavor was also dominated by a cooked, flowery hop flavor.  It seems to be the house style, and I unfortunately despise it.  As it warmed, the malts kicked in more, and some port like sweetness kicked in, salvaging the beer.  I can see why a person who likes the flavor of overcooked brocolli would like this beer, but cant fathom how so many people on this site seem to go for it.  RERATE:  12/10/06 at the 4th Richmond Gathering.  The broccoli flavors I remember were forunately replaced by an orange marmalade note.  Markedly better, new numbers posted.

The Abbaye des Rocs had a rich toasty malt flavor, very acidic, like a cabernet wine, also, yeasty, something reminded me of an aged brandy. The alcohol is somewhat noticeable throughout the drinking experience, and I was picking up on some fruity notes like apricots. The finish was dry, reminiscent of brute champagne, a fine beer but not one that swept me away and sent me to Oz.","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

Apart from this, I get lots of caramel and a bit of chocolate.  Maybe some wheatiness as well, but it could be my imagination as there is so much going on here!

2875,"2003-07-01",4.0,"Finally, this one is mine...after tasting the Grand Cru and loving it, seeing that this one is rated higher, I expect even more from it! The pour was very nice...a very hazy brown colour with a thick slightly off-white head. Typical of the good belgies, tons of very small bubbles rise from the sides of the glass. The smell....simply stated, phenominal. Slightly musty, toffee, pit fruits, caramel and even pepper are noticable. The flavour is musty, malty and pretty sweet. Not the depth and complexity I really expected, but the flavours I do pick up are pretty good. Some sugars (both caramel and chocolate) are noticable as well as some spicyness. The aftertaste is a bit drying. Definately a top 50 beer, but I don't know if I would classify it as a top 10. Either way, a good beer to be sampled by all of you guys!

Toffee, alcohol, nutty malt, freshly baked wheat bread, and sheets that have been lined dried on a summer day are in this aroma.  An alcohol bite that hits the back of the throat.  An odd but not unpleasant sensation between the lively effervescent/spice feel and the creamy smoothness from the head. Taste of unsalted honey nuts, caramel, and perhaps figs.  Chewy.

Complex and powerful.  Deep, hazy but not opaque red-brown in color, with a lasting and very foamy ivory head.  Flavor is equally stunning with toffee, cocoa and dark bready maltiness, vaguely tart, acidic, cherry-like fruit, earthiness, pepper, bitter spiciness, yeast esters and developing an alcoholic warmth and nuttiness towards the lengthy finish.

Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.

Starts with candy sweetness and explosive fruitiness, brassy and citrusy.  Quite peppery with a slight hint of smokiness.  Hard to even begin starting to describe the flavor, very complex.  Primarily a full, malty sweetness in the flavor.  Ripe and tangy.  Finish lengthens out with the malts with a toffee and caramel sensibility.  Sour.

Re-rate.
Ruby brown color. Gurgling foamy head. Strong aroma of tangerines and tart green apples sifting through the olfactory senses. Smell of orange blossums pouring out of the glass like a mad scientists concoction. Delicate sweet malt and wild flower honey conjoined with citric hop flavors embrace the tongue. Lace slowly drools down the side of the glass rejoining the compact screen of bubbles floating on top of this malt elixer. Smell of Bayers childrens aspirin peering in. Wafts of raisins, plumbs, dates, and kiwi complement a subtle peppery mango flavor. Candy sweet taste left on the lips. Banana and nectarines in the nose and on the tongue as this nears room temp. Buttery walnut finish casually evolves into a citric sensation devoid of bitterness, leaving a soft warming alcohol sensation. WAY under-rated.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","Allseeingeye"

Grainy, doughy malt, ripened honeydew, caramel, nuts, bananas, subdued hints of cherries, spices (ginger), brandy and more. Amazing. Very unique in taste as well. Just about medium bodied, slightly syrupy. Soft floral notes swimming with the abundant ripened fruit flavors, complex sweet malts countered by subtle sourness and yeasty fluffiness and mustiness. Finishes with a perfect spicy alcohol kick, ripened fruit juice and a smidge of yeasty dryness. So well melded and balanced, the little alcohol that is evident just adds character.

2875,"2002-10-16",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2004 Abbaye des Rocs, a farm brewery founded in 1979 as a weekend hobby by a Belgium tax inspector, has acquired a reputation for producing complex and satisfying strong ales. Abbaye des Rocs is the first beer the brewery produced and is justifiably the most famous and acclaimed. Made in the style of the Trappist ales, and on the site of a former monastery, this is an impressive example of an Abbey Ale. The appearance in the glass is of a beer still in production - clouds of creamy foam drift and gather in intense pockets, hinting at the alcoholic intensity gathering below. The nose is packed with alcohol and incense of cedar woods from Lebanon. Even before tasting you have an awareness that this just could be a religious experience. Inhale deeply and the luscious fruits burst over-ripe and sticky sweet - this is a seductive rotting corpse. Melons, plums, dates, a hint of ginger from the Orient, Syrian tobbacco, dripping mollases, a freshly dug grave...Taste. O yes! taste! Alcohol. Dark brown, sultry sugar, lazy as a warm afternoon, seductive as the wettest of dreams; fruits as subtle, complex and compelling as an Arabian harem. Rum on a fruit salad. Whiskey swirled into condensed milk. Rich, overwhelming, overpowering - cherries, leather, talcum powder, manderins, brandy, the tastes go on and on, sip after heady sip.

I would give it a higher score but I know there are even better beers out there.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
2875,"2001-12-01",4.4,"Brass-brown medium-intense, some matter floating around and not fully limpid, quickly fading white foam and little bubbles.  After the foam has gone, a beautiful radiant hue remains.
Vinous and very special aroma, followed by good hops, with depth.  At room temperature, this beer actually develops complexity in the aroma, very good.
Very fine tasty flavor, some licorice, bread-yeast with a medium-hoppy dry finish.  Good foamy body in the mouth.
Well balanced sweetness-alcohol-hops, long aftertaste.
A very interesting beer, not unlike the medium-bodied versions of some trappist beers (8) but with perhaps a bit more hops than most (except Orval).","Sterrebeek, BELGIUM","Belgik"

2875,"2001-08-28",4.2,"Its obvious there is significant variation from bottle to bottle with this beer. Bovs headless beer was a gorgeous masterpiece in my glass for the duration of the session. Very deep malty aromas with only some fruit of the prune variety, molasses and the spicy air of brandy. The strength of the beer revealed itself with a tingle or burn to the lips and mucous membranes. The finish was sharp and herbal -- also quite different than what others describe. Still a remarkable beer! Thank you Shadallion!","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"

2875,"2001-05-27",4.9,"This is why I drink. Very close to my favorite. If it were not for the occasional slight corkiness from its arduous journey to me; I think it may be perfection. Rich, smooth and somewhat delicate. And what a bouquet.","Mt.Prospect, Illinois, USA","Drew Blood"

2875,"2001-02-17",5.0,"This is one of the very few beers that I give a perfect score. It seems like no one else knows about this beer, but let me tell you, its a beauty. Burgundy color, ripe fruit aroma, amazing sweet-sour contrasting taste. As good as it gets.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
