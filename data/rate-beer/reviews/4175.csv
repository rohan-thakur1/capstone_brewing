4175,"2015-05-13",2.8,"6 pack, February 2015Bright ruby-tinted amber body is clear and has a cornmeal colored head atop that is well-retained.Quite the aggressive aroma...Certainly very influenced by the columbus, with a good deal of acidic pine and sourdough-heavy munich malt. On the edges are some spicy, moderately grassy hop notes that smell delightful but are very dominated by the heavy pine and orange rind alpha acid assault. Possibly some alcohol in there too...Sadly, more of the same in the flavor. Jacks Abby seems to either want to bludgeon you with bitterness or leave it wholly absent; not much in between. This would have been a nice beer to tolerate some acidity, not that I really know why you are trying to get PNW high alpha hop character, especially the pine resin, in to a German-style dunkler bock. But at this rate, its just too much and takes over the beer. As well, the munich malt creates too much of the signature sourdough-like toastiness and its just all palate fatigue after the first few sips. Well-attenuated, with a soft, almost slick texture that becomes nearly creamy from the tight carbonation. Reminds me of Old Guardian, somewhat...","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Pours lightly hazy deep orange/copper color with a 1 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, herbal, floral, grass, light caramel, toasted bread, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good complexity and balance of big citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, herbal, floral, grass, light caramel, toasted bread, and herbal/grassy earthiness. Fair amount of spicy herbal/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, lemon/orange zest, pine, light caramel, toasted bread, and herbal/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Very clean on lager flavors with zero yeast ester notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice hoppy amber lager. All around great complexity and balance of citrus/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; and very smooth and crisp to drink for the ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
4175,"2015-01-21",3.7,"Most of what Jacks Abby Brewing tends to make are ales but fermented with lager yeast. In the case of Lashes Lager, it is supposedly a bock style (or Hopbock according to the label), though it is closer to what I would associate with an amber ale. And as an amber ale it works quite well, but as a bock it does not. Not that I grade to style, anyway, just that I really appreciate the flavor profile here.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a lager glass. It was bottled on 10/29/14 and cost $2.69 ($0.22 per ounce).

Appearance: Hazy shade of copper/amber/orange with plenty of visible carbonation. Pours to a large, white, soapy head which retains and laces quite well.

Smell: Sweet floral scent, like a bouquet of flowers. Hint of citrus.

Taste: Munich Malt is the only malt mentioned in the description and it definitely comes through right away. A slightly bready, perhaps toasty, malt character. Lightly sweet with an authentic grain taste to it. Theres a subtle floral and citrus hop character lurking in the background throughout the first half of the swig. On the backend the bitterness becomes quite prominent, though its still pretty tame compared to an IPA (but would be normal in an amber ale). Theres some spiciness right on the finish with a taste comparable to rye. Light orange citrus is noticeable, too. I do notice a slight astringency on the finish, which is a bit bracing at first, but easy to ignore. Overall, its a tasty, interesting and satisfying palette, though Im not sure why its marketed the way it is. I enjoyed it.

Drinkability: Lagers are supposed to be lighter, crisper, and more easy-drinking than ales and thats true of Lashes Lager. However, considering its a rather potent brew at 6.8% ABV, Im a little surprised there isnt more complexity and body. This is the kind of beer where having a sticky, chewy mouthfeel would actually be beneficial.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

4175,"2015-01-07",3.9,"Bottle purchase at One Stop Market. I fell like a lot of people dont appreciate some of the old school German styles. This is a nicely hopped German bock that is under rated in my eyes. Dark Amber color with thin lasting head. Aroma is earthy malts, pine and toasted caramel malt.
The flavor has the essence of autumn throughout the sip. Earthy Munich malt that gives a dried leaves note upfront with a mild toasted grain and cracker like backbone. Mild hits of caramelized sugar. Before the beer becomes to sweet from the malt, a nice level of citrus and pine hops show in the backend of the sip to balance everything out. Moderate level of bitterness. I want to drink more after the bottle is empty and I really dare somebody to find me a better brew in this updated American version of this classic German style lager.

4175,"2014-03-04",3.2,"My Bottom Line:
Spicy hops and mild cereals evolve in a lean and drinkable body for a clean but forgettable pint of Dunkler Bock.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the clear amber.
-This lacks malt character for my tastes in the style. The Andechs we had side-by-side was much better defined for the same abv range and similar body.
-The chosen hops are harmonious with the grain bill, but tend to take it over flavor-wise.
-The mouthfeel is as slender as most Jacks Abby lagers.

4175,"2014-02-12",3.8,"Bottle: Large gradient from tinged amber all the way to deeper shades of copper, even with a hint of ruby in places; large, foamed-up & creamy light-beige head lots for a while & leaves great lacing behind. Aroma is packed with wet pine needles, dirty & earth-laden hops, leaves, a hint of bitter, white pepper covered citrus rind & a decent backbone of semi-sweet, toasted & borderline caramel-like malt. Very nice hop bite on the front end of each sip with strong notes of pine tree, earth, & obscure citrus. Lots of brash leaves, giving a strong pungency & really stinging the back-end of the tongue with bitterness. The Munich malt introduces a nice toasted cracker, biscuit-like sweetness & flavor, just shy of toffee, without growing too sweet. Clean finish, pine resin aftertaste with a lasting bitter bite.

A thick pillowy head of foam adorns the prettiest color beer I have seen in a long time. Leaves sheets of wet lace. Nose is bright with fruity and floral hops. A bit of subtle citrus and stone fruit quality. There si a rich deep malt in this that sports both grainy bread and a light brown sugar. Taste is handsome. Restrained and subtle hops lend a citrus twang to a very earthy grain that has a bit of baked sweetness on it. Tiny bit of resin to coat the throat and leave a rich aftertaste. Brown sugar, hop floral and a light hop spice that goes so well with the earthy and lightly sweet grain. The carbonation is a bit tingly and the hops give a seductive little sideways glance to this beer and they finish with the smallest bitter. 

Just fabulous. Hearty, rich, textured and full of flavor. The stone fruit in this is the surprise and the sensation. it softens the hop character to the point of luxury. It enhances the grain sweetness but doesnt overshadow it. It takes to the bit of hop spice and makes this beer dapper and a little bit sweet.","New York, USA","pinkie"

4175,"2013-02-17",3.4,"500ml bottle in a lager glass.  Pours amber with a lacy, cream-colored head.  Aroma of citrusy and floral hops and some pale and toasted malts.  Flavor the same with a nice amount of hops for this style.  Average texture.  A pretty good beer for the style.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
4175,"2013-02-15",3.6,"500mL bottle purchased from Learys for $3.30. To snifter it pours a rusty amber gold with a trim off-whitish fluffy head. Aggressive aromas of American hop pellets, krill oil, caraway seeds, lager yeast, pineapple syrup, moldy peaches (did you catch my music reference there?), burnt fabric and guava. Starts off a tad fruity and malty, with notes of piny and citrus hops, grapefruit zest, and green tea.  Honey, vitamins, yeast by swallow. Good beer. Perhaps a tad too much hop bitterness, but overall a pleasant experience, Im officially a fan of this brewery.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
4175,"2013-02-15",3.5,"500mL bottle courtesy of radarsock.  Cheers, Ander!  Pours a mostly clear sunset amber with an off-white head.  Nose is light caramel and bread with some earthy hops.  Flavor follows- nice assertive malt character with hints of lager yeast and some sweetness among the light earthy and piney hops.  All in all a nice, medium-bodied Vienna.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
4175,"2013-01-21",3.6,"Bottle from gn0sis. Pours a nice golden red with a fluffy, persistent white head. Big citrus and pine aroma. Taste is very hop forward, very fresh and bitter. Drinks like a hoppy red ale. Very well balanced.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RABinCO"
4175,"2013-01-21",3.6,"Resinous IPA type aroma over faint caramel background. Copper color with lacy tan head. Bittersweet malt taste which is is mainly bitter with a striking, crisp sweet malt strip down the middle. Not caramel flavored, but something starchier. Definitely the strongest and bitterest vienna style lager around, an imperial version of that style. Good product continues to flow from the lager lovers.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","Scrapersnbeer"
4175,"2013-01-12",3.9,"Wow - this is like a sheep in wolfs clothing - more like an IPA than a Vienna style lager. Pours beautiful hazy crystal amber with a decent white head. The aroma brings decent sweet and somewhat tangy hops. The flavor brings some sweet hops and tangy malts as well, very decent for the style.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
4175,"2013-01-06",3.6,"50cl bottle pours a clear, honey brown with some frothy white head.  Nose was inviting if not a little muddled, some lemon, citrus peel, grass, pine needles, a little malt, biscuit.  Flavor was nice too, sweet, malty, crackers, lemon, grass, a little lemon grass.  Medium, dry finish.  Well balanced.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
4175,"2012-12-28",3.6,"Bottle.  Clear gold with some leg and head.  Aroma is	very nice combo of American pine, ripe tropical fruit and grassy, spicy character.   toasty grains done through. The flavor is very balanced with distinct hop and grains coming through. Great beer.  Cant wait for distro in NyC.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","bmerz"
4175,"2012-12-28",3.7,"Poured from half liter bottle into lager glass. Thick, foamy white head over golden bronze, clear liquid. Head persisted for a while then dwindled to foamy rafts. Aroma was slightly hoppy, trace citrus, swee malt underneath. The flavor is clean, a little piney, a little floral, nice grapefruit bitterness. Sweet malty flavors underneath. Pretty well balanced. Went nicely with spicy chicken and salsa I was eating. Nice brew, even if it is named after some guys eye hair.","Massachusetts, USA","LeRose"
4175,"2012-12-24",3.3,"500ml bottle. Light golden pour with a white head and decent lacing. Hoppy aroma but the flavors were slightly more to the malt side. Nice refreshing well balanced beer.",", Massachusetts, USA","BroSpud"
4175,"2012-12-24",3.6,"Much more subtle than their other beers, this one employs a hop-forward nose but then a much more malt, almost marzen-like, mouthfeel.  This works well and could be enjoyed by anyone accustomed to the more standard microbrew.","Madrid, SPAIN","CamdenD"
4175,"2012-12-23",3.3,"Aroma has bread, caramel, and grass and pine hops.  Flavor has starts with fruit and bread, with some earthy bitterness in the finish.  Another solid effort from a good brewery.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","annunz123"
4175,"2012-12-20",3.5,"500ml bottle. working my way through the series of jack abby brews that shawn sent me.  thanks again... pours a deeper amber hue,  dark but still allowing for some light to pass through, and topped with a two finger creamy off-white head.. once again a fairly hop forward aroma with aspirin perfumey floral tones to begin with becoming a touch grassy while the malts biscuity malt provides an intermingling with the previously mentioned. not bad... flavors of biscuity toasted caramel malt to coincide with floral hop tones where one doesnt step on the others toes. nice interplay between the hops and the semi-sweet nature of malt.  the backend presents a mild earthy aspirin bitterness. medium bodied, bigger than the others that ive had thus far with a semi-lively level of carbonation. semi-sweet and malty through the middle and bigger body doesnt make it as quaffable than the others but still a solid offering to JAs lineup.  pretty good.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
4175,"2012-12-19",3.5,"Hey a vienna cool... Taste is nicely hoppy with some dank grassy hops with light citrus.  Crackers and biscuits dominate the malt flavors with a light hint of sweetness.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
4175,"2012-12-17",3.6,"A hoppy tasty malty lager, oddly dry hopped to shut, cool but one of their weaker ones","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
4175,"2012-12-13",3.2,"500mL Bottle, purchased at Downtown Wine & Spirits - Somerville, MA. Minty resin aroma, nipped with orange and rosemary. On the palate, this is okay. It reminds me of early attempts in the brewing world to make hoppy, bitter lager and it was kind of middling. This has a clean, but strong bitterness, but not a ton of hop flavor. The lagering is clean and crisp, but the malt has a flavor like too much Crystal malt or Special B that turns me off a little bit. Sadly, one of my less favorite Jacks Abby experiences.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
4175,"2012-12-13",3.4,"fresh bottle.   pours a clear ruby red with a small  dirty white head.     aroma of.... hold on a second here.  It smells like a hoppy bock!  toasted sugar kissed herb and tangerine hops intermingeled with nuts, toasted caramel, touch of aspirin.  hops and malts mix to form a weird  piney, cherry cough syrup, toast.   leaves a dank bitter resin in the mouth.   peculiar beer.    complex to be sure, but in a strange, why is this bock so fucken hoppy kind of way.   neat. fine.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
4175,"2012-12-11",3.9,"Pours a clear, deep, orange/amber color with a huge bubbly beige head that takes forever to recede. Smells of sweet bready caramel with a spicy, earthy, mineral edge to provide some balance. The flavor is quite sweet which threw me a bit until I noticed that the beer is named hopbock not hopback. Sweet caramel toffee and bready with a spicy earthy hop flavor. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a sweet spicy mouthfeel. This is a nice hoppy bock style beer I really enjoyed it.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
4175,"2012-12-09",3.3,"Pours clear amber-red into a Sam glass. Off-white head with excellent retention recedes leaving spider lacing. Sweet caramel and resin aromas. Medium bodied with sweet caramel turning quickly to an earthy bitterness before the lasting resin finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
