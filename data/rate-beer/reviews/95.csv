95,"2016-10-31",3.6,"Large bottle picked up by blonderedhead at Stinson Liquors. Poured into a pint glass. This one has a healthy pumpkin presence from the onset. You can really smell the nutmeg, cinnamon, and other elements of a pumpkin pie. The color is also reminiscent of the Thanksgiving dessert delight but with a little bit more golden orange than tan/beige. The taste is big and pretty artificial which I think works both in its favor and against it in the long run. Initially it gives you what you asked for when you purchased it. Lots of pumpkin and a strong feel of autumn. Upon further consumption, the fakey pumpkin pie taste starts to get pretty old and it becomes a sweet, sugary and alcohol heavy affair. Those conflicting feelings affect the overall rating. Its something you should try during the season but one pint is surely enough.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"

Pumpkin and caramel malt sweetness along with clove, cinnamon, brown sugar, vanilla, nutmeg and graham cracker. Amazing!

Full bodied with a zesty spice presence up front that lingers over the pumpkin and sweet malt notes into a slightly dry finish. Strong clove, cinnamon, brown sugar and allspice notes followed by pumpkin puree, caramel malt, vanilla and nutmeg. Very dessert like and lacking the earthy vegetal quality that makes so many pumpkin beers so unappealing. Still, the strong autumnal spices and sweet malts make it feel like a beer.

O: I wanted to like this one based on the ratings, but this did not even come close to other pumpkin ales *cough* Pumking. I did not get any pumpkin flavor, which I thought was because maybe the bottle was from the year before. (The place that I bought it from recycled last years ST Warlock). The bottle was fresh, though, so that wasnt the cause. Spices arent even very prominent. This was disappointingly mild all around. It also had too much bitterness on the back end, which Ive experienced before with other Elysian beers. Honestly, the bitterness grew to overwhelm what little flavor that there was.

95,"2014-09-24",4.3,"Transfer from BA review on 9-25-13-

 Poured from bottle into a snifter

 Appearance- The beer pours a nice hazy orange amber color with a very small white head. The head fades decently fast leaving some patchy bubbles of foam on the surface of the beer and a decent level of foamy islands of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  A nice roasted pumpkin smell creates the biggest aroma. This is complemented by spice aromas of cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. Other aromas of a bready smell as well as a nice caramel and brown sugary sweet smell are there as well giving an overall great pumpkin pie aroma. While pumpkin pie like, the smell is not too sweet or too spiced but consists of a very nice blend of aromas.

 Taste  The taste begins with a good bready and roasted pumpkin flavor. The sweetness is lighter upfront with just a bit of caramel sweetness. The spice flavors are lighter as well at the start, with some hints of cinnamon and nutmeg. As the taste advances the nutmeg and cinnamon spice are joined by some allspice with the nutmeg growing quite a bit more potent to the end. As this occurs, so too comes some sweeter flavors of more caramel and brown sugar. Along with these flavors, the roasted pumpkin grows a bit more intense with the bready taste fading some, leaving a moderately sweet pumpkin pie like flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and chewier side with a carbonation level that is on the slightly lower side. Both are fantastic for the pumpkin pie like tastes of the brew making for a creamy, thick mouthcoating texture one would like with something resembling a pumpkin pie dessert. 

 Overall  This is a very nice and tasty imperial pumpkin ale. A little on the drier side and more roasted pumpkin in nature with a nice blend of flavors and a great feel overall.","","Darkmagus82"

M: Medium bodied with moderate on light carb. Semi dry finish. Pretty decent mouthfeel.

O: yeah, smells good, but tastes brutal for me. I like Elysian, and have previously enjoyed this beer, but wow, not impressed. Alcohol, sharp chemicals, bitter. This is not good.

Lingering notes of pumpkin, pumpkin seed, cinnamon, gingerbread, pie crust, nutmeg, clove, allspice, caramel, brown sugar, herbal, and toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of pumpkin, malt, and spice flavors; with big authentic pumpkin presence and fantastic malt/spice balance; and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth and lightly slick/syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish.

95,"2013-04-19",3.8,"THOUGHTS: It wasnt as good as I thought it was going to be but, dear lord, it tasted just like my mothers homemade pumpkin pie. Surprisingly light and easy to drink for a pumpkin beer this big. Definitely like pie made from fresh pumpkin, not canned pumpkin. Hid alcohol incredibly well. Great in that it tasted like actual pumpkin pie, but a little off from great pumpkin pie-like beers. Not quite sweet enough or malty enough. Just because something tastes good, doesnt mean its a good beer.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a hazy, light golden orange with a small, off-white head that mostly diminished. The aroma had moderate caramel malts and roasted pumpkin; light sour pumpkin; pumpkin pie spices; slight alcohol; pie crust; fresh pumpkin pie. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and ever so slightly bitter and sour; while the finish was heavily sweet, and lightly acidic and bitter with an average duration. There was fresh pumpkin pie, meaning fresh pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices; sour pumpkin, slight alcohol and pie crust. The light to medium body was leaning toward medium was a little dry with fairly fizzy carbonation and dry finish. It went down extra easy.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

I would expect the imperial version would be over the top, but the clove isnt so spicy here and theres no ginger to speak of. The cinnamon comes through the most.

Good pastry-like flavor and mild caramel sweetness along with a moderate spice character.  More importantly @ 9.5% it comes across as very smooth and almost on the flat side as far as carbonation is concerned.    Overall a very good Imperial pumpkin beer.","Washington, USA","22415brewery"

95,"2012-09-16",3.8,"November 1st, 2009 - I believe strongly that Elysians Night Owl is the pinnacle of pumpkin brews. It strikes the right balance between pumpkin flavors, pumpkin spice, and single handedly sets the tone for fall. When I was a kid, I knew Fall had arrived when my family and I would trek out to a rural pumpkin patch and pluck the choicest gourd from the fields. As an adult (and far from home) I have to do something else, and the new tradition has been to open a bottle of the Night Owl. So, why shouldnt the Pumpkin King be an even more refined version? The same minds are hard at work bottling some of the primest cuts of Fall, and theyre obviously putting effort it into it based on the awards this has racked up. Does it live up to the Night Owl (which, at the time of this review was considerably easier to acquire than the Great Pumpkin.)? With bated breath, and a glow of the Indian summer settling on my lap, I pour the brew, producing a cloudy orange-brown brew, and that familiar smell of pumpkin pie. New to this brew, and less pronounced in the Night Owl is an intoxicating smell of roasted apple and cider. The flavor, too, really pushes its vegetable qualities - sweet potato, roasted pumpkin or kombucha, and a sharper emphasis on the spices: all-spice, clove, pepper and cinnamon. And how does it stack up to the Night Owl? I think I like the aroma better. That added apple note captures my hippy-dippy love for the season even better than the Night Owl, but when it comes to quaffing, I dont think the Night Owl has been unseated. The flavor is good, but just not as good as its more plebeian counterpart. I guess the title isnt too misleading. They called it the Great Pumpkin, not the Greater or Greatest Pumpkin.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

The flavor seemed to be similar but lacked some of the intense caramelly notes or malt depth to balance the spices.

95,"2009-10-02",4.1,"Appearance: Pours out a lightly hazed, amber-colored body with a thin, short-lived, white head.

Smell: Well-spiced, sweet-smelling, Autumnesque nose of pumpkin pie garnished with pumpkin seeds. Yeah, theres a backdrop of malts to help set the scene, but, come on, were here for the pumpkins, right?

Taste: Malty base with a taste of delicately toasted bread dusted with light brown sugar. Pleasant, pleasing taste of gouged out pumpkin meats and pumpkin seeds follows, the latter of which Ive begun eating over the last year or so. A word of advice for anyone interested in taking up eating pumpkins: stick with the shelled, roasted, and salted variety. Sure, the in-shell ones arent too bad, but, man, that shell is difficult to chew and trying to properly pass those shell shards is like crapping out a +2 morning star the next day. Where were we? Oh, yeah, so the fairly clean hop character provides a light, complimentary bitterness. All of the listed spices are on hand and well-represented, though the cinnamon and nutmeg are the standouts for me. Touch of alcohol. Still more pumpkin flavor yet to come on the dry, spicy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: A splendid finish to a fine evening. The Great Pumpkin is a wonderful pumpkin ale and one I recommended, provided youre a fan of the style.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
95,"2009-10-02",3.8,"On tap at Falling Rock in Denver.  Pours a clear orangish-copper color with a small white head and some lacing.  Aroma is exactly like a pumpkin pie, really great.  Flavor is fresh pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices - cinnamon and nutmeg especially - along with brown sugar and just a touch of alcohol.  This approximates a pumpkin pie better than any other beer Ive had (eat that, Buffalo Bills!).  Fairly sweet, but not too much so.

95,"2009-09-22",3.7,"08 bottle from Bottleworks. Liking this a whole lot better than I thought I would - and from the photo at left, theyve really improved the label on this one (for one thing, it actually has a pumpkin on it, now). Pours a dark orange with a smallish head and a good amount of sediment. The profile is incredibly well balanced here - the dry roastiness of the pumpkin seeds, along with a slight hop presence, is balanced really well by the warm baking spices and smooth malts. I actually really enjoy how even the alcohol plays into this one (though the bottle says 7.7%, not 9.5%). Keeps it clean, and keeps the sweeter malts from becoming overbearing. I still think Id take hops over pumpkin any day of the week, but for the style, this one is very, very well executed.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

Very nice clear spice aroma. Very pumpkin pie dessert-like aroma. Nice aroma. Very nice sweet cinnamon spice flavor. Not a big body on this thing. Spice flavor is there with the sugar/sweet flavor, but the body is not very good, which doesnt allow for the flavors to be carried well. Overall, a nice sweet cinnamon spiced beer.

Palate  Slick Mouthfeel, off texture with a dry finish.

Creamy whipped cream pie topping in the nose and tasted, the pumpkin character is a mixture of some semi-tart natural pumpkin ""meat"" and a creamy, slightly sweeter milkshake pumpkin character.

95,"2008-10-02",3.7,"Tap at Blind Tiger: Pours a deep copper orange with a tan ring of head. The aroma is sweet- glazed pumpkin pie with lots of whipped cream and a mild spice presence (clove/allspice). Has a slick texture, and despite it’s rich sweetness, it’s never cloying.  The flavor has a very strong whipped cream presence, more so than any other pumpkin beer I’ve had to date. Has some pumpkin pie innards, fresh/sweet whipped cream, vanilla notes, with a later mild spice presence of allspice and clove into the toasted dry-ish finish. This is a pumpkin ale that emphasizes sweeter notes and less spice character, but it’s creamy and natural, conjuring the experience of sweet pumpkin pie with lots of whipped cream. Even though it’s sweet, it remains highly drinkable. I like it.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

Pale orange pour, with a delicious aroma of pumpkin pie spice blend and canned pumpkin (minus the metallic after-smell).  A thinner mouthfeel than the above-two mentioned beers, this was still very delicious.

95,"2006-02-06",3.8,"Dark amber beer with a thick, creamy white head.  Aroma is very spicy, loads of nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice.  Lots of sweet maltiness coming out from underneath the spices.  Toffee, some breadiness and a bit of pumpkiny vegetal character.  Finishes sweet and a bit chewy.  Some earthiness and a spicy finish.  Some light apple/peachy esters in back.  Very tasty.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
95,"2006-01-05",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2006 This is not the batch 1000 great pumpkin, but the December, 2005 release, with ""The Great"" as the sticker, instead of ""Batch 1000.""  I believe its also 9.5% ABV.  Pours cloudy dark amber with a thing white head.  Smells of (shock) pumpkin, cloves, cinnamon, as well as sweet malts.  The feel in the mouth is smooth with decent carbonation.  The taste is the best of all the pumpkin ales Ive had.  Substantial pumpkin flavor (not just a spiced beer), with good malt/hop balance and a smooth finish.  Quite enjoyable!","Seattle, Washington, USA","acertain"

95,"2005-10-03",3.1,"Yellowish brownish orangish color w/ a tall laced off white head.  Lots of spice in the aroma w/ and odd somewhat pumpkin pie ish piece.  Avg palate.  Tastes of bad pumkin pie, nutmeg and other spices.  I wouldnt drink it again.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
95,"2005-01-07",3.6,"Bottle pours a clear copper color, moderate fizzly white head, lively carbonation, with mild lacing. &nbsp Aroma is very similar to the Night Owl, but perhaps a bit more spicy. &nbsp Seems that alcohol is also a bit more noticable. &nbsp Definitely spicier and maltier on the tongue than its normal cousin. &nbsp Bigger body, with a thicker mouthfeel. &nbsp Lingering malts and spices on the finish. &nbsp Noticeable alcohol as it warms.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
95,"2004-12-01",3.5,"Dark copper/brown with a creamy white head and lace. Light aromas of pumpkin spice and some hops. Not too strong or defining. Pumpkin aplenty in the flavor. Good ol pumpkin pie. Malts and a light flowery, citrus hopping. Malty body with a nice pumpkin throughout. Creamy palate.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Sham"
95,"2004-11-18",3.6,"Schooner: Hazy bronze color with an off-white creamy head and light lacing. Nose of allspice, nutmeg and faint pumpkin. More like pumpkin pie. A touch of floral hop aroma that comes across very much like an orange with a bit of banana. Tastes spicy, easy drinking. Creamy smooth finish, not bad!","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
