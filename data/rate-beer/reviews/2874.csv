Tasting there is a citrus lime tart flavor, some acidity, subtle sweetness, very clean bitterness, and a crisp malted grain taste. The finish has a lime flavor lingers but soon fades. The bitterness is minor but enough to subdue the lime. I believe the blood orange might offer something to the bitterness that makes this unique. The body is spot on with good carbonation and mouth feel. It was also nicely balanced. Overall a drink worth trying.

Stopped in to pick up a gift certificate and saw Hill Farmstead on the board. Insta-purchased. After looking up some more information, I dont think its actually Hill Farmstead, but Grassroots (which may just be a part of Hill Farmstead). Either way I was looking forward to trying it without even looking what the group thinkers on Beer Advocate and Untappd were saying.

Poured a golden orange clear color with 1-to-2 fingers of off-white, fizzy head. Some bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Very good spotty lacing. Average retention. (Sight - 4.00)

Smelled spicy up front, then got orange blossom, blood orange, hibiscus, floral aromas, lime zest, pear, citrusy notes, grassy notes and light green apple. (Smell - 4.25)

Tasted even better than the nose, getting lime zest, citrus, blood orange, grass, herbal, pear, kiwi, hibiscus and hints of cinnamon spice. (Taste - 4.50)

The pour is a grotesquely magnetic (heavily) cloudy safety carrot orange: a trim unretiring white-ringed head 1 finger in length stood atop.  Immediate aromas of carrot skins, red cabbage, Hawaiian hibiscus, lime meat, tangerine zest, farmhouse yeast, Lady & Northern Spy apple cores, citrus-forward hops, white pepper, sweat, cotton, and a brief pumpkin seed note.  Tastes much the same: with additions of: wheat grain, crushed coriander, a touch of hard water minerality, plastic, and boiled rice.  Particularly enjoyable. Not exactly what I was thinking it would be. Reminds me more of an unspicy soured salsa saison that another Mimosa.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
2874,"2015-11-17",2.8,"Opens as a bit of a gusher but its not too bad. Lost about an ounce/ounce and a half before it settled. Pours a very cloudy, dark golden orange color with tangerine hues and a three finger, frohy white head that very slowly settles into a lasting ring. Good retention with large chunks of soapy lacing left behind. 

Slight earthy floral aroma with a strong citrus character and prominent spicy zest. Only subtle farmhouse character with slight musty funk. Could use more barnyard/farmhouse/saison character but its dominated by peppery spice, bready yeast, tropical hops and citrus fruit. Theres a bit more farmhouse quality as it warms but theres still too much going on and the strong citrus presence hinders the other flavors. 

Medium body with crisp carbonation and a blast of overwhelmingly sour, tart citrus flavor. There is a ton of lime flavor which almost completely obliterates the farmhouse and saison characteristics. Intensely dry and puckering citrus flavor, like a few ounces of lime juice was dumped into the bottle. All lime juice and citrus zest. Slightly peppery and spicy but after a while, when the palate adjusts, the saison notes very subtly start to show up. Subtle farmhouse funk, spicy hops and tropical fruit. Grassy with faint barnyard character but again, the citrus is so strong and overpowering it kills off everything that I enjoy about the style. Needs balance and has way too much citrus/lime flavor. Very disappointing.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

The pour is a nice foggy orangey-gold with a nice thick white head and some great lacing as it falls down. The aroma is pretty good. I wasnt expecting this one. Its got a lot of lime citrus, a little pepper, and some solid funkiness. Its light and crisp. The flavor mimics this. There seems to be a little more tropical fruit in it with the distinct lime and lemon zest coming through on the forefront. The flavor is just like the nose, in that it just is crisp and clean. The mouth feel is a little thin, but the carbonation really helps out here. There is an excellent crispness to it, and for me not being a fan of saisons, this is just good.

2874,"2015-10-05",4.3,"Pours a vibrant, hazed golden-orange color, with a sizzling, huge white head, slowly fading down to a glass coating lacing.

The nose is full of tart lemon zest, accompanied by white bread, funky cheese and leather, building the beers foundation. Its fruit impression gets enhanced by sour blood orange rind and wet mushrooms. All in all the aromas feature an intriguing balance between tart fruits and pleasant funk, coming well together, with notes of old potatoes, forest flowers and saw dust.

Has an incredibly smooth mouthfeel to it, while the carbonation remains unusual high, which leads to an outstandingly pleasant drinking experience, finishing with soft mineralic qualities. 

Tastes of matured hops, hay, lemon rind and dough bread, while its fantastic mouthfeel and clean design reveals a plethora of nuances, encouraging me to keep on drinking. The beers refreshing qualities reveal themselves, as luscious, funk coated blood orange gets introduced. It packs a rich fruitiness, as well as a bitter punch, successfully balanced by hay and crackers. Its aqueous, mineralic quality gets the most noteable during the finish, due to a fusion of lively carbonation, blood orange and lime, creating a sappy, bitter, pleasantly funky finish, with a hint of fructose to it, adding even more depth to the bitterness.

While this is certainly funky and tart, fruits are the mvp in this beer. The main difference to the popular fruit juice ipas is, that this beer is not entirely based on the fruits. It entangles them into recognizable barnyard qualities, which all benefit from the beers fantastic balance, opening the palate to many details, which becomes the beers biggest strengh overall. Very unique in taste, successfull on all fronts, while remaining its focussed freshness, this one is a winner.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Good clarity.Again, very well-presented/constructed Belgian aromatics in the nose. Peppery phenols, light plaster, floral notes and very, very mild acids. A good deal of light vanilla-cream-like maltiness and just a pinch of lime in the nose. No sign of the blood orange nor any alcohol or flaw. Really cant reiterate enough how refreshing it is to see a brewer doing unique Belgian ales that arent just a noseful/mouthful of brett or conversely, a mess of brutish peach/banana/apple esters.The flavor is given a bit more to the lime, though nowehere is it overdone. Rather it balances against the malt, which, while not overly sweet, still provides enough body and, in concert with the always tight carbonation from HF, another perfect mouthfeel. Soft fruit esters (apricot, nectarine) and light pepperiness are all enjoyable, while minimal funk has developed. Adam was a bit disappointed that it hadnt really funkified over the course of its year in bottle, but it didnt bother me.

Aroma quite fruity and also noticeably funky. Blood orange flesh, lime peel, dried apricot, a bit grassy, white pepper, earthy barnyard hay Hill Farmstead character with lime juice acidity underneath. Juicy tart fruit up front with lots of bright lime and rich orange, nectarine too I think. A very light malt sweetness in the middle to balance the acidic quality but citrus leads. Drying into the finish, still acid core but joined by wet hay with very light funk, restrained herbal hops and a bevy of citrus zest flavours that give a bitter aftertaste. Slight minerality in the finish. Light bodied with big aggressively effervescent carb.

The acid level is pleasant, buoying the lingering fruit qualities while also carrying the overall flavor toward a more detailed overall impression than is often found in an additive-focused example like this. The palate is fulsome but of course not heavy; juicy up front and semi-dry in the middle. Pulsing acidity and cheese rind in the extensive finish.

2874,"2014-08-08",4.1,"Bottle; Pour is murky golden with a chunky white head into this glass - well - a product of this bottle doing a little gushing upon careful opening. The white head dissipates into something of a modest light layering - there is a sticky lacing presence, albeit feint. The nose is floral dominant (hibiscus), and it moves to a clean mineral water note as Ive come to expect from a Hill Farmstead saison. Intertwined with the florals is a clear note of citrus spritz, as well as a touch of grain as well. It is nice, certainly - but I wasnt overly impressed by it, frankly. The flavor profile I find is where this primarily shines for me - You cant get that light bitter dominant tartness from the nose from the heavy citrus additions, nor that touch of butter cream intermixed into sweet slathered honey bread. This one begins and ends with lime citrus tart, and you do get a small sense of the blood orange flesh here - If not knowing it was there ahead of time, I would be hard pressed to guess, however. The floral note rounds things out beautifully but frankly has a greater effect on the nose. It finishes fairly robust, with a clean, semi dry ending. Its spiced with light pepper, moving to feint lemon, and doughy yeast. Its... everything I could currently want in a summer beer. Unfortunately - this is my one and only bottle.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

2874,"2013-12-17",4.1,"In short: A very citric-tart fruity blonde Saison with an awesome farmhouse character.
How: Bottle 750ml, a few times, first batch, from uber-fresh to three months of age.
The look: Cloudy glowing blonde-orange body topped by a persistent small white head.
In long: Nose has a true Saison character that is beyond rustic, this is very much barnyard. The aroma is both very barnyard and very fruity (citric-citrusy), and there is also some sulphuric notes. In mouth the beer feels thick and juicy and with a tickling carbonation of lots of small very hard bubbles. Taste is less farmhouse and more citric-fruity than the aroma. Lots of citric fruity flavors creating a razor-sharp tartness making the beer quite intense and not a 5% you can drink like a pils. The beer was less citric and easier to drink when fresher, some will prefer the intensity that has developed, I enjoyed it more when softer and very fresh. A superior Saison again from HF/Grassroots. There is no way a blind person sitting next to me could know if I am having sex or drinking Hill Farmstead Saison.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

2874,"2013-10-01",4.5,"Consumed 8/25/13, poured quickly into a HF fest glass. 

A- Pours a cloudy orange-copper with a soapy brilliant white head about 3 inches tall with good to excellent lacing. Over a few minutes it falls to about a half inch coating over the beer. Medium carbonation. 

S- A strong brett presence with a lemon-lime tartness, I cant tell if it is the fruit or some acidity from bugs. Smells much more funky than I remember from the last time I drank it. Some rubber band phenolics also present. 

T- Wow- not what I was expecting at all from the nose! Extremely tart- lemon and lime. I know it has been mentioned in previous reviews, but this is very reminiscent of alcoholic sprite. On the end, there are some pepper and floral notes that really balance out the extreme tartness from the beginning and seem to cut the acidity to a not-so-lingering level. 

M- Much more effervescent than I was expecting. The carbonation really accentuates the acidity up front. Body is medium to low. The dry but not cottonmouth finish makes you crave another sip as soon as you swallow. 

O- Another hit from the HF/Grassroots crew. I drank one about a month after release and I dont remember it being nearly as tart as this, although I think it has improved. That being said, drink it now...this is a simply amazing experience.","","justforrazors"

Cant dig the flavors of this, its over-spiced and has a strange emergent quality from the combination of aromatics. The sour Saison base is very nice, but I feel like its been compromised by citrus. Normally, Ive been a fan of Shaun Hills citrus use, but this feels like other mainstream attempts to incorporate flavors in an aggressive way, it degrades the quality of the base beer without adding anything.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Grapefruit and lime juices dominate this brews profile, while tartness and strong cheese-like bacteria create excitement in the finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the hazy blond.
-The carbonation was not as high as I wanted it to be.
-The mouthfeel is lean and highly drinkable.
-While this is very pleasant, I would have preferred a more discreet presence from the fruit juices.

Huge notes of lime rind, pith, orange juice, saison yeast, brett florals, tropical hibiscus, and some bitter grapefruit. This thing was so fucking good it sickened me. Tried newer batches, a lot more hibiscus and way less lime which I wasnt too happy about but still a delicious Vermont juice.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
2874,"2013-05-27",4.4,"75CL bottle enjoyed at home at cellar temp in HFS stemware. Gorgeous hazy burnt orange, nice 2 finger pillow-like head that fades to some nice lacing. The nose is this nice spicy citrus with some oaky / earthy characteristics. Taste is very soft, great seltzer-like carbonation. Impressive saison spiciness that fades to a sour / tart lime juice finish. It has this floral overall softness that is so impressive. The ingredients list has me thinking theres too much going on but this blends incredibly well. This is a fantastic saison! 5% too so its drinkable as hell. Wow. Dan, Luc, Shaun, you guys rock.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
2874,"2013-05-27",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 7, 2014 750ml bottle in a tulip.  Pours cloudy copper with a lacy, off-white head.  Aroma of citrus, light fruits, spiciness, caramel and pale malts, and a floral finish.  Flavor the same with a lot of lime and citrus plus a light tartness.  Average texture.  A good saison, like everything from this place.
Edit: This beer is amazing.  The new batch is so perfect with the lime blending so well with the tart saison base that is characteristic of this brewery.  The texture is so fluffy and perfect.  Shaun Hill has perfected the art of brewing.
Edit #2: Oh wow, Im drinking this again and its even more perfect than last time.  The hazy golden color and lacy, off-white head in the Hill Farmstead tulip.  The aroma of the light tartness and citrus and malts.  The amazing texture and perfect carbonation.  W. T. F?  How does one person make so many incredible beers that are miles beyond other breweries?
Edit #3: Batch that was bottled in May 2014.  This beer is still insane.  If youre ever able to go up there and buy unlimited amounts, put some lime in it one time when youre drinking it.  Dang this beer is good.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
2874,"2013-05-19",4.1,"Pours and orange amber with agressive head filling my HF glass.  Leaves some traces of lacing on the glass.  Aroma reminds me of the sea.  Really bright upfront fruits, the citrus really pushes thru.  Super easy drinking, great beer.","Goffstown, New Hampshire, USA","Zeeben"
2874,"2013-05-19",4.3,"Bottle supplied by my homie Nick... Thanks man! Pours a slightly opaque orange color with a massive white head that reduces to a film quickly. Smell is very citrus forward... Obviously lime is upfront and orange and I do get the hibiscus. Taste really is awesome... Lime, peppery spice, and a bit salty... Like a beer bloody Mary without tomatoes. Super crisp and refreshing. Carbonation really lights up the taste buds. Glad I have 2 bottles, but wish I had more!","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","seth_lfod"
2874,"2013-05-17",4.4,"Drove up today to try this amazing gem out, perfect balance of fruit, acidity and saltiness. Blown away, no matter how many I buy, I always have that feeling that I didnt buy enough. Ah, just had a sip, beautiful!!!","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
