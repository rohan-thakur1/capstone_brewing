605,"2017-02-04",4.0,"Thanks Kirk for sharing the bottle! Poured into a taster showing pitch black with half a finger of latte colored foam. 

The nose shows a strong lactose forwardness matched by a strong black coffee background and hints of fig. 

The palate is light bodied and lightly carbonated for a stout. Despite the nose, there is only a light lactose sweetness and countered with a lot of intense dark roasted coffee character. Coffee character is perfectly restrained and balanced without entering the burnt or toasted territory. Finish is short as there is practically no bitterness given the strong espresso character on the front end. Very well done for the flavors in terms of balance and restraint but could use a bit more character..","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

Little hazy dark brown beer, practically no had. Aroma: coffee, coffee and more coffee. MF: soft carbon, medium to full body. Taste: coffee, alcohol, bit sourish, more coffee, bit sweet, caramel. Aftertaste: little bitter, hoppy and earthy notes, and once again, coffee and more coffee. Well, since coffee aint my thing, neither is this.","Gent, BELGIUM","tderoeck"

Ooh, mouth is even better, with a big, creamy collage of fresh coffee, sweet cream (Irish cream?), roasted malts, and something more, like dried berries or other dark fruits. Maybe a touch of raisin and fig. Really good actually. Super creamy mouth feel. One of the more elite Tree House brews.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"

Bottle: The aroma consists of heavy coffee/espresso, moderate chocolate, and hints of cream. It pours a dark brown with no transparency and and a small beige head that fades to a minimal film outlined by a thin ring. The flavor starts with moderate chocolate with a hint of molasses.

605,"2016-03-30",4.2,"Growler in line at MBC Dinner release. This really tastes scarily similar to a café au lait -- the coffee flavor and aroma is huge, and instead of putting it into an imperial stout (like a lot of breweries would do), the concept of putting it onto a creamy, slightly sweet milk stout is a stroke of genius. I found the Single Shot to be a little too sweet for my palate, but the bigger ABV and the higher quantity of coffee really bumped this up to a fantastic level.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

605,"2016-02-25",3.6,"Growler filled 2/13/16 and drunk 2/20/16, thanks to blisscent.Lovely pour shows a cascading burnt sienna head atop a moderately hazy milk chocolate color. Head retention is strong.Rich bread and chocolate in the nose are joined by toffee and lactose-influenced vinousness. Espresso, coffee grind, vanilla; its all there. The coffee and lactose are quite prominent, perhaps dominant, but not overdone. No alcohol or flaws noted.Its hard to not hold this to an Imperial Stout/Double Stout-type of rating, but its important to keep in mind these are certainly not that. While still a big, rather rich stout, its not a thick, chewy, booze/roast/malt bomb that many/most Imperial Stouts tend to be. Rather, the milk sugar and the espresso do the talking and the body while respectable, is much lighter than what youd expect. A bit of syrup from the lactose/coffee and some very heavy ""breadiness"" or almost a popcorn and grit-like character. I find it in all three of the shot series beers and its a bit off-putting (texturally, for the most part). Light anise-flecked bitterness on the end.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

605,"2014-06-23",4.2,"Thanks to jlindros. Ethiopia Yirgacheffe version. Pours black, essentially no brown showing at the edges. Nice foamy head of light brown cream. Pretty good lacing, particularly for a growler pour. Very good retention, too. Aroma has a big shot of coffee on top of a good amount of chocolate. Really nice roasty coffee. Some fruit but its more of a chocolate, roast mix. Creamy and nice. Reminiscent of Vietnamese Speedway, which is probably my favorite coffee stout. The flavor follows the aroma. Lots of coffee, seems a bit fruitier than the aroma. Chocolate isnt quite as big, and it could use it. I think that chocolate base would be there if they pumped up the strength a bit. There is some light milk chocolate with some some dark chocolate depth. Nice, creamy feel, particularly for a growler pour. Smooth, relatively low carbonation. Thick feel for the abv.
