4299,"2012-01-13",4.0,"After a recent visit from the Thomas Hooker representative, I wanted to try the full variety of brews.  Ive had most (if not all) of the Hooker beers over the past couple years, after all they are practically right down the road.  Theres also a few rumors floating that some new beers are on the way, so revisiting the old favorites is becoming even more of a priority.

This brew from Hooker Brewing is the Munich Style Lager.  There is often a shortage of Lagers among craft brewers, largely because of the extended brewing time compared to that of Pale Ales and IPAs. This Munich Style Lager is cool-fermented and aged for 6 weeks, compared to the average ale which can be ready in just 2-3 weeks.

Munich Style Lager pours out a clear golden color, with just a thin layer of white foam. The head fades back pretty quickly, as you can see by my 3-seconds too late photo.  The aromas are what I think of as the quintessential smell of beer.  Just a touch of hops is largely overwhelmed by the firm backbone of malts. This isnt the candy-sweet style of malty aromas though, Im talking about the just slightly sweet, bready/grainy style of hops.  It smells much like the best lagers in the business, such as Augustiner and Weihenstephaner.

On the palate, this Lager is almost exactly what I expected: crisp, clean, and easy-drinking. Theres a touch of malty sweetness up front, which just a slightly dry finish on the back-side. A deliciously balanced brew! I now know why this Munich Style Lager is ranked so highly on beerAdvocate!  Why did I not try this one sooner? 

Located in Bloomfield, CT, Thomas Hooker brewing has received some serious accolades over the past 10+ years that theyve been brewing.  High on the ""best brewery"" lists from both beerAdvocate and RateBeer, this local favorite should not be over-looked!","Connecticut, USA","TheCorkStops"

Pour yields a good white head of foam and some spotty lacing on the way down. The nose brings a nice subtle noble hoppiness plus light grain and a bit of bread. Excellent balance between all the components. The flavor is very nice as well with a good lightly-sweetened malt presence and a good level of hop flavor and bitterness to cut through the malt character. Light body and really crisp. Great dry finish and a high amount of carbonation. Really, really solid beer. Thomas Hooker seriously knows how to make lagers. Great way to say cheers.

4299,"2006-06-02",4.2,"22 oz bottle, pilsner glass.  A stunningly massive and creamy white head rests on an inspiring body that ranges from honey gold to pale straw in hue.

Delicate lemongrass and perfume tones fill the remaining spaces.  Honey and toasted bread malt notes play out fantastically in the flavor profile yeilding to a soft, grassy bitterness in the finish before taking reign once again in the aftertaste.  The mouthfeel is a little fuller than average but the real story is in the texture.   Its almost creamy, but plenty wet and slick enough to slide right off the tounge and leave you both satisfied and thirsting for another sip.

Mild sourdoughyness develops midway betraying the quality of the malt extraction. Light grassiness emanate from the hop aromatics, accentuating the sense of balance without distracting from the overall mellow feel. Crisp medium body, efficient cleasing carbonation.

4299,"2005-11-26",3.3,"(22 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with ClarkVV, thanks Clark!) This is one hell of a golden lager!  Very bready, grainy, somewhat sweet, and gently bitter, with a light and very pleasant smokiness in the finish.  Despite being lightly bitter, there is a modest hoppiness lending some crispness to the palate.  Light-medium bodied, but more than substantial enough for the style.  The nose is bready and grainy, with a slight hoppiness in the background.  Medium golden in color and fairly cloudy in appearance, but the small white head settles to a filmy layer.  Overall a very pleasant beer in a bomber that has gone down entirely too easily and quickly.  One of the better beers Ive had in this style.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
4299,"2005-11-23",3.5,"Clear golden pour with a thin white head. Good aroma of crisp malt and noble hops. The flavor is enjoyable, nice crisp malt and noble hops, it finishes bitter. The palate is smooth and creamy. Its good, very crisp and clean.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
4299,"2005-11-21",3.2,"The Lure:Citrusy refreshment merging with the humble cereal. Earthy hops shyly approach the biscuity malts. Lactic sweetness dripping through the haystack.

The Festivities:Crisp cereal slowly forming a nourishing loaf of bread. A dry, hoppy finish intrigues the tongue enough the make it plunge back for another sip. Personally, I would have preferred a little more hop flavor, but as is this is a suitable quencher for both craft beer lovers and their thirsty acquantainces.

Soft aroma of sweet white bread grains and fresh doughy crusts. Slight grassy-like hopping.

Nice taster! Lovely sweet bready malts with a buttered corn crispness and tender grassy induced spice and mild bitterness. Pale malt finish with drying breadyness and lighter transference of dull caramel.

Gentle and firm well-rounded full-bodied, malt saturated feel. Tender carbonation; soft and chewyish. Solidly sweet with the white breads, but milded in tone enough for super extreme slopping down of this liquid. Nice addition of grass/spiced hops add an outstandingly fine balance. An excellent quaffer in which one bomber exceeds in its bounty and more then one is definately required and/or suitably easy to handle. Damn fine stuff!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

4299,"2005-01-21",4.1,"This proves that the brewery not only produces awesome big beers, but can handle more subtle styles as well. Pours a dark golden/amber, with a massive head that leaves good lacing. Aroma is sweet munich malt, caramel, and light grassy hops. Mouthfeel is remarkably smooth, feels great on the palate. Starts off sweet with fruity notes of tart apples, mixed with sweet honey and some munich graininess. Turns pleasantly bitter with grassy and lightly spicy hop notes, and finishes crisp and a bit dry. Very well made, glad to have been able to try it.","Connecticut, USA","Cottrell"
4299,"2005-01-13",3.4,"UPDATED: SEP 7, 2005 2004 bottle (possibly even 2003?) compliments (big compliments) to Jay (springslicker) who definitely sent me much better beers than I sent him in our last trade.  I owe you, man.  Good clear golden-deep yellow pour.  Medium amount of white head.  Aroma is faint and has notes of almonds, herbs, some lightly cardboardy notes, and some lightly spicy lager yeast.  The first whiff of vapor out of the bottle is great though, rich hay, soily hops and sweet malt.  Flavor of good grainy malt sweetness, nice and light but still present.  Waxing sweet on the finish, but then, there is some awkward alcohol persistency.  Hmm thats odd.  Drinking through it, it dosent seem to really bother me.  Good enough medium-light body.  Could use more hops, though Im impressed they didnt try to do the American thing and go crazy.  Quite filtered unfortunately, but to be expected and understood.   Carbonation seems restrained, which is great, as well there is a touch of lager yeast.  I dont know, I think this is closer to a pale lager than a dortmunder, as there is little hops apparency.  I dont want bitterness, but it needs more hallertauer and tettnang flavor.  Could use more body.On draught at Redbones, 2005 edition.  Wow, much better than in the bottle, not surprisingly.  Fresh, hoppy nose and crisp lager yeast, with light spiciness and some grainy malts sticking through.  Flavor is light honey and vanilla, bits of lemon and pale grains with a restrained, but flavorful hoppiness, all in quite a nice balance.  Refreshingly light bodied, but not watery or thin in the least.  Fantastic on draught as a summer quencher.  WIll have to try the new bottles again.  I see were back to Dortmunder/Helles on this and not Pale Lager.  Pretty good helles/pale lager, whatever the case.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
4299,"2004-12-15",3.7,"clear, bright golden hue, massive slab of snow-white foam, swiftly dwindling down...aroma is slightly sweet, but balanced and dry, ultimately, lightly hoppy, floral, herbal, nice.
Taste: smooth, effortless, slick and wet, small texture, but altogether satisfactory. Small hoppy edge, adequate malt, ample taste, but perfectly drinkable. Light bodied, but not skinny in the flavor department, nor is it in any way outward or lush, no, its just right...and Im liking it more, as I finish it off!...slightly buttery-sweet, though, but Im not knocking that...
I can easily see this as the good beer you can serve to your friends who normally choose a macro lager or some such, theyll either be impressed by the total package and wowed by the taste, or wont know the difference.

4299,"2004-11-05",3.4,"First off, I dont like this being categorized with Budweiser, Coors and Miller. I would rather it be categorized as a Helles as the brewer prefers... Anyhow... Crystal clear, textbook amber lager with a mid-sized, frothy, white head. Very good retention with spotty lacing. Interesting, malty and yeasty aroma. The nose is a blend of white pepper, jalapeno pepper (without the heat), a fusion of rye and white breads and damp straw. The flavor is hearty and malty, but very well balanced with just a hint of caramel and jalapeno (without the heat). Medium to full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation.

4299,"2004-10-03",4.1,"This bomber came to me courtesy of BeerAdvocate spritdeus via a trade.  After poring, the beer revealed a clear golden colored body, and a two inch tall foamy off white head.  The aroma was clean with honey like pilsner malt, and faint florally grassy hops.  The taste was malt driven, with a sweet honeysuckle flavor and very mild hop bitterness.  The mouthfeel was creamy and soothing with a medium thick body.  This style is supposed to be difficult to pull off as there is no way to hide any off flavors.  And Troutbook is clearly at the top of their game, as they have brewed a beer that does not possess any off flavors that would need hiding.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
