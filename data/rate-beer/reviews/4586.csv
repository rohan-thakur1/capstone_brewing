4586,"2016-12-13",3.7,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is fairly citrusy with some grapefruit zest and hints of lemon and lime. Light coriander notes. Hints of grain and wheat. Light floral and fruity esters. 
Pours a somewhat hazy, pale, yellow gold with a very, very large, pillowy, white head that continues to expand before eventually falling into itself many minutes later. 
Flavor is slightly sweet with some light wheat and grain notes. Moderate citrus notes of grapefruit, lemon, and orange. Light coriander notes with some light, peppery phenolic notes. Light floral and fruit esters with pear and stone fruit. Low bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with very high carbonation (but not a gusher). Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a pretty tasty beer with good aromas, but it is impossible to drink with how carbonated it is and how good the head retention is. Nice citrus notes with light, balanced phenolics. Light floral and fruity esters add some complexity.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Sampled alongside twenty other Fant√¥me beers.

The beer is hazy and light yellow hued, with a small white head and sparse lacing. The aroma brings some light spice, candied fruit, and a subtle medicinal scent. Good flavor. Tastes like fruit juice in some regards. Refreshing and light, this is a stellar example of a session beer. A lot of flavor packed into a 4% abv beer. I would definitely have this again, and would like to have a few of these in the cellar.

Poured from a 750ml bottle into a large cognac snifter.
The color of autumn sunshine . . . if you could only really bottle such a thing. LOL! Medium head which dissipated slowly into lacing at the top. Once the beer settles, the ""sunshine"" look of it kinda hazes over a bit with more of a white element.

The nose? WOW! Think of your nostrils being pummeled with a mallet made of grapefruit. Intense citrus and definite grape fruit aroma is almost overwhelming, but in a very, very good way. Never had anything like it

Taste: As I go for the 1st sip, I¬ím almost squinting my eyes, expecting to drink a form of carbonated grapefruit juice. And there was the magic of Fantome: not a grapefruit note to be tasted in the drink. Not a one that I could pick up at least. Great spicy taste, some citrus back notes, a bit of vanilla and oak as well, but no grapefruit. An incredible beer!

Mouthfeel & Drinkability: This is listed as a witbier, but I felt it more as a saison . . . almost bordering on a sour. That said, the drikability is definitely up there with witbiers. This could easily be the 1st of many glasses for me. Smooth and very tasty.","Florida, USA","Maltzilla"

4586,"2007-11-30",3.6,"In short: A funky Saison cleverly disguised and a Witbier.  Different and interesting.
How: Bottle 750ml, relatively fresh (about 2 months old).
The look: Cloudy dark golden body with a large off-white head with medium retention
In long: The nose is funky, very funky, I¬ím talking lambic-funky.  That funkiness is joined by the smell of a freshly backed lemon pie.  Very nice aroma.  Taste is not up to the aroma.  Overall impression of a vanilla ice-cream flavoured Saison.  A bit caramelized and buttery.  Kind of lactic and that vanilla ice-cream flavour became more and more apparent as the beer warmed up.  Surprisingly dry with medium acidity.  Carbonation is sparse, too sparse.  Started out great but I found a 750ml a bit too much.  Of course this is Fant√¥me so your bottle and my next bottle will something totally different.  Good beer, different, unusual, almost bizarre.  In the world of Witbier this one stands out like a black man on a Mississippi executive golf course.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
4586,"2007-04-23",3.9,"Sampled March 2007
This beer has quite a bit of chill haze to it; the beer went into the freezer brilliantly clear, but now sits in my glass a fully hazy, orangish amber color.  It is topped by an initially four-finger thick, pale off white colored head.  The aroma is enticingly spicy with notes of orange, earthy spices and some dusty malt notes.  There is a touch of herbal character as well as some other spice notes that are quite evident, but that I can¬ít quite pinpoint well enough to tell what they are.  Hints of dusty pepper, touches of ginger, and a spicy herbaceous character.  There seems to be a touch of funk here as well, this smells in some way like a Lambic, though it could just be the spicing choice and yeast character (a taste will settle that though).  The aroma is quite enticing, and I could spend quite some time just smelling this aromatic brew.

Quite light on the palate, in fact it is very light and easy drinking; eminently thirst quenching even.  Somehow soft and creamy, sort of tastes like a dry orange cream soda.  Lightly tart, though not overly so and it finishes with a spicy, peppery bite that has hints of ginger and arugula.  This beer is really quite dry, I am not sure if there is even a hint of malt sweetness left.  The peppery finish is quite interesting, it really lingers on after a sip and even tickle the throat with a hint of cayenne-like heat.  There is some ingredient here that is really interesting, I can¬ít quite figure it out.  It is almost a savory flavor / quality (perhaps it is savory, though in this case the herb not the adjective I meant in the first place).  Going back to the finish, perhaps it is more herbaceous than peppery (it is just a hint after all), or more correctly it seems to be some type of green herbal note that has a peppery character to it (something like arugula that I mentioned previously).  This beer is also quite earthy at times, I don¬ít mean some generic much, but instead a rich, nutrient rich loam that is peppered with mulched herbs.

Ok, this beer is just packed with complexity and it is only 4% alcohol.  Plus the really light, quaffing character of this brew is just wonderful.  I love it when brewers make beers with this depth of interesting flavors at relatively low alcohol levels.  The spicing here is perfect too, whatever Dany did, this beer has a ton of spicy character that lies just below being recognizable.  If it was not for the apparent, aromatic orange character, I would classify this more as a Saison (though historically Wits, and Saisons where really quite similar).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
4586,"2007-03-28",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2007 Hazy light orange/golden pour, pretty underlying pink hues. Bristling, half fizzy/half creamy white head, extremely well retained. Lacing is copious and scattered oddly about. Aroma is sweet yeast, toasted grains in moderation, barnyard smoothed over with a banana cream twist, lemon zest and sweetened lemon juice, cotton candy, orange and the slightest white pepper nuance. Flavor is semi-sweet with accentuation of the lemon and yeast notes. Moderate bitterness makes the mouthfeel lively, additions of pine and sourness make it moreso. Palate is light to medium bodied, very effervescent and moderately acidic. Finishes sharply with lingering sweetness and yeast particulates dancing across the tongue. Fantome rocks. This is the only witbier I could presumably drink all day. The Fantome never grows tiresome. In fact, Fantome only becomes more interesting with every glass that empties, with every bottle opened.

4586,"2006-10-14",3.9,"75 cl bottle. Pronounced the same as its sister beer, the Blanche Hotton Eau. Different label (red) and definitely a different beer (if it was originally intended to be so, is another question). This one pours with a cloudy orange golden colour with pinkish notes and a fine white head. Geuze-like aroma full of grapefruit and a hint of wood. Grapefruit flavours, dry acidity and some mild woodiness. Very dry mouthfeel. Medium carbonattion, lightish body.

Peachy golden colour, much darker than your typical wit, hazy with a rocky white head that reduced to a minimum. Artificially sweet and fruity aroma with hints of wood and spices. Very sweet and fruity with raspberry and winegum flavours. Feels a bit like a wit mixed with artificial fruit sirup. Towards the finish woody dryness hits in, giving the beer some lambik character.

4586,"2005-11-05",2.3,"An unclear yellow beer with a disappearing white head. The aroma contains notes of wood, cork, and citrus. While the flavor contains notes of wheat and citrus - especially lime - as well as hints of dust and cork, while the body is thin.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
4586,"2005-09-18",3.6,"pale yellow hazy beer, fizzy carbonation is gone in 15 sec. aroma: lemon, peach, perfumy and a little sulfuric. taste: acidic, lemon, coriander when warming up and some wheat. sour fruity finish with a bitter hint. bit too thin but o.k. witbier. just a little strange!","Veendam, NETHERLANDS","Otje"
4586,"2004-12-10",3.9,"Very pale color. Cloudy to the point of milky, no head. Honey, chalk, milk and lemon in the aroma. Something like green tea and lemon, sweetened with honey. Thin, even a bit watery , but very drinkable and refreshing. Something like diluted lemon juice with a dash of fruit yoghurt. Distant cousin of my all time favorite witbier: dubbel wit Neerijse. Love it!","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
4586,"2004-09-13",4.0,"Bottle - bottle conditioned Fizzy, white head, which disappears instantly.  Yellow/white, cloudy body.  Citric aroma.  Heavily sour, lightly bitter initial flavour which faints out to a lightly sour finish.  I thought I would never like a White Beer, but then I tasted this one.","Aarschot, BELGIUM","diabel"
4586,"2004-07-15",3.3,"Cloudy yellow coloured, small head. Wheat aroma combined with citrus and coriander. Quite sour flavour. Ok wheat.","Bussum, NETHERLANDS","jerohen"
4586,"2004-07-12",3.2,"(Draught - sampled as ""Blanche de Soy"") The colour, consistency and aspect of peach yoghurt. Slim rim of white head. Orange, citrus, coriander and some other herbs only Dany knows come out in the nose. Very classical witbier taste - surprisingly ""clich√©"" for Dany. It¬ís OK, however. Very creamy mouthfeel (like drinking yeaststarter), slick, milky. Aftertaste is more fruity than the start. I never thought Dany would brew such a stereotypical beer - if one discounts its looks. No real Brit would drink this, unless offered a loaded gun alternative!","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
4586,"2004-01-04",2.5,"Wheat and lemon aroma. Hazy, pale yellow color, white head, fair lace. Light sour start but soon more sour lemon flavors, light sweet in the background, wheat, rather thin.","Delft, NETHERLANDS","jbrus"
