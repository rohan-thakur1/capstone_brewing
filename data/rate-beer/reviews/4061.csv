A - Pours a very dark brown with reddish hues, slight sediment even on a fresh pour. Fully still with no head. 

S - Nose is incredibly cheesy with a hearty amount of funk. A little bit of copper penny, tart oaky notes. Really enticing nose. 

T - theres a lot of penny / metallic notes in this one, nice cheese rind, some earthy mulch and tons of basement mold. I love how it coats the mouth, has a swampy moldy grape finish. I like the underlying lemon juice that you get throughout the entire palate and throughout each sip.

M - Very thin, oily but then a dry chalky enamel stripping finish
