1726,"2017-01-30",3.5,"Thisll sharpen me up and make me ready for a bit of the old Ultravilot. (Sorry I couldnt resist.) Keggy-weg at the Shilling Brewpub, Glasgow. Mid gold, clear. Little head and no lacing. Theres the violet sweets but also floral notes with a bready sour note. Taste is sweet, a bit artificially so (the Parma violets again), with a wheaty sourness behind it. Long finish which seems to have a better balance that the initial taste. Light body, and theres more of a carbonated feel than one would think from looking at it. Enjoyable although in the top 50 hefes? Not sure.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","jjsint"
1726,"2016-04-25",3.6,"Keg at Doghouse. Pours murky golden orange with a modest brown head which soon recedes to a foamy circumference. Aroma is parma violet, lemon zest and vanilla. Taste is parma violet sweet, slightly herbal, vanilla sweet with a light tarty zesty lemon finish.","Glasgow, SCOTLAND","GlasgowTAD"
1726,"2016-03-04",3.1,"660mL bottle BBE: April 2016. Chilled (approx. 8 degrees). Pours a densely cloudy, russet orange body with medium, fairly tight, lasting yellowish head. Considerable lacing of the glass. The nose is of medium intensity, with cornflakes, juicy apples, tart, over-ripe raspberries, parma violets and refined sugar, along with a slight Belgian funk, soapy and metallic notes. An initial light-medium crackery sweetness becomes more artificial and sugary, but is well counteracted by a crisp bitterness. The body is light with a velvety texture, medium-high carbonation and a touch of astringency in the finish. As it says on the bottle, this is a bit of fun. However, aside from the parma violets which certainly come through, this is actually quite austere for a Hefeweizen.","Ayr, SCOTLAND","thmsboyd"

1726,"2015-07-25",3.8,"18th July 2015Bottle. Very hazy gold beer, thin pale cream colour head. Palate is light and crispy. Pure Parma Violets on the snout, makes me grin! Very light malts. Parma Violets - loud and clear but clean and light and never sticky or cloying. A little citric hop provides contrast and there a mild floralness underpins. Light crisp finish with a violet floral linger. Very nicely done and great fun. Whilst I can see this was a total bitch to make, can I request a Refreshers version next?",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"
