Clear blond beer with good compact head, aroma is fruity and pleasantly hoppy, taste is just lightly malted with good attenuation, a little fruit from the yeast and a lots of tropical fruit notes from the hops. Huge drinkability, good balance and very good taste and bitter makes it kind of a session beer to my mind.

Bottle @ Domus Birrae, Roma
Pours hazy blond with thick white head, aroma is fruity and slightly hoppy, taste is just lightly malted with very balanced fruty notes from yeast and hops. The hoppy carachter is less pronounced than draft version, and the overall taste and bitternes is a little more balanced but personally i think a little less attractive too, even though the slightly more pronounced yeasty carachteristics of taste and haziness are definitly missing on tap.","","Peppone"
