3767,"2016-10-30",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2016 My Bottom Line:
This fluffy banana muffin of a Heller Weizenbock succeeds due to its chewy wheat, soft banana and pear esters, and clove spiciness intermingling with herbal hop bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the misty whitish blond.
-Prickly effervescence softens the soft wheats weight.
-Alcohol is not a bother at all in the flavour profile.
-Drinkability is high for the style.

3767,"2013-07-03",3.2,"50cl bottles, sampled both fresh and 2weeks after its BB date. The regular Gutmann Weizen is one of the most harmonious and fresh Weizens around and their Weizenbock preserves much of the natural fruitiness (banana, strawberry) and a fair hop presence under the extra layer of maltose sugar. Not a big fan of this brick-heavy style mainly because of its weight and sticky palate, also present here, reminiscent of an adhesive aspartame coating. Best enjoyed fresh, as the 3-4months older bottle tasted rather flat and looked like murky lemonade - the higher ABVs do not do much in this respect.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

Saliva-inducing scents of Hallertauer nectar, vanilla bean, banana cream pie, puddinglike yeast and pineapple jump through the foam in this heavenly aroma. Distant crackle of cookie malt tickles the nostrils along with the obligatory, though pleasingly restrained, bubblegum and clove. Soothing mousselike carbonation. Spicy plasticlike and clove phenolics seamlessly meld with fluffy wheat backed with a firmer dusting of piecrust and cookielike malt. Vibrant banana cream pie character is laced with pineapple and a vanilla purity which bears an uncanny resemblance to cake frosting. Meanwhile, the Hallertauer persists with a remarkably refined mouthwatering lusciousness which perfectly matches that of the malt which boasts an all-enveloping depth of softness. Unparalleled balance and finesse on display here. And at 7.2% abv, there is nary a trace of alcohol. Dainty scratch of clean hops echoes the well-composed clove zip. Resoundingly estery and phenolic, though the byproducts are seemingly undetectable due to the astounding cohesiveness. Sweet bubblegum-laced powdered sugar sweeps the tongue, complementing the palate-hugging wheat starches. Splash of seemingly-open-fermentation tartness dazzles the palate along with faint spiced-apple delicacy and an ongoing medley of tropical fruit luster. Hop spice gently exudes in the finish, though the hops remain predominantly nectar-laden possessing a hugely appetizing vibrancy which exquisitely harmonizes with the beefy, wheat-induced slickness. This is downright stupendous and awe-inspiring, and such an impressive feat for the brewer to have coaxed every imaginable nuance from the yeast.

3767,"2009-12-21",3.7,"The bottle looks very good, the beer in the glass also. Starts strong, quite yeasty, fruity notes of peach and apricots. Also a bit earthy-woody. Very drinkable and good weizenbock!","GERMANY","kappldav123"
3767,"2009-05-02",3.3,"500ml bottle bought at Reading BF 09, drunk at home.  Certainly lots of weisse in this.  God I mean completely opaque white/orange.  Thick lasting off white head.  Tastes fine though.  Must be the uglisest beer Ive ever had.  Fresh weizen aroma.  Yeast and cereal.  Good fullnes in mouth, the extra alcohol gives it some booziness.  Some lemon tangerine flavours on the finish with more wheaty flavours.  From the look of it you would think it would taste awful, but in the mouth its full and tasty.  Decent","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

Lingering eastery note with a light acidic touch. Dry wheaty finish. Too overpowering wheaty for my liking, well brewed though.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
3767,"2007-07-15",3.5,"500ml bottle at ""Manne"", Irgertsheim. This weizenbock turned out to be a very good version of its style. Well balanced wheaty tartness all the way through. Moderate haze level to an orange body under a filmy layer of foam. Aroma has got noble notes of wheat and yeast. The rich and comprehensive taste starts with an initial yeasty touch followed by tart dark fruits and spicies. Lingering tail with the sweetness from caramel and light vanilla. Medium to full bodied. A good partner to local made cheese (22.06.2007).","Tromsø, NORWAY","Rune"

3767,"2007-07-05",3.2,"Cloudy light amber color; the head disappears quickly. The aroma is simple. The flavor is sweet, even if not sticky, a bit fruity (to start with banana) and candy-like, with a light trace of wheat. Quite good.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

The flavor is sweet malty with notes of banana and oranges, leading to a dry wheaty finish, where the alcohol bites the tongue.

3767,"2007-01-07",4.2,"This is an awesome Weizenbock, has a wonderful aroma of frech buttered banana bread.  Pours fairly light, but with a decent head.  Incredibly full bodied and all around tasty weizen.  It was really like a banana milkshake with a touch of alcohol.  awesome beer, will definitely be buying a box.","Wroclaw, POLAND","convex"
3767,"2005-07-10",3.8,"I cant pretend to have tried that many Weizenbocks, but this must be up in the top rank. Hazy golden colour. It has all the banana and clove character that you could want. Plus the added alcohol actually adds a bit more punch and interest rather than detracting. And because its pale it doesnt have that sweet sticky malt character that stronger German beers often exhibit. Some might say that being relatively pale disqualifies it from being a Weizenbock, but what the hell. Damn tasty stuff.
