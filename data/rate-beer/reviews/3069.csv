3069,"2017-03-20",3.8,"tap @ tucson hop shop: I dont often rate beers with this many ratings but this is quite special. I have been fortunate enough to taste quite a few of the top 50 smoked from Germany, all of which were excellent examples of German Rauchbiere in their various forms. However, this Left Hand is quite a different beast. The nose could almost fool one into thinking that there is a German Bock with ample smoked malt hiding in the glass but with the addition of some charred wood. The taste, however, is quite different. This is very close some sweet stouts with maltose in its perceived sweetness but manages to carry over a lightness all the way into the finish which leaves me with a mix of caramel, charred wood, oak smoke and a general desire to go sit by a fire somewhere outside. This comes together very well for me but in a different way than expected.","Zurich, SWITZERLAND","derA"

3069,"2017-01-06",3.9,"0.65l bottle from 2012 shared with The Tasting Crew. This one pours a really deep and dark brown colored body, on the border of being black actually and it has a medium sized quite rapidly fading brownish head. Love the aroma. Just so much bacon! Smoked bacon and beef with hints of pine, roasted malts and a little minty herbal hint. Nice! This is how I like my smoked porters. Not over the top smoky, not too sweet or too beefy. Really round and balanced this one! Gliding oily in the mouth and its soft and gentle on the carbonation. Theres a good amount of chocolate also in this one.

3069,"2016-12-08",3.8,"Treated as an imperial smoked porter, this was poured into a snifter.
The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a thin white to off white foamy head that dissipated at a good pace. Mild lacing builds around the rims nicely and adequately.
The aroma takes on the normal qualities of a smoked porter: some meatiness (maybe ham/bacon) and then theres some salt, did they do this intentional? Me, I dont mind, but have to admit, thats a bit different.
The flavor yields to the sweet to smoky meatiness flowing over a sly earthy/bitter hoppiness. Saltiness comes back slyly. Decent flowing meaty sweet sly stickiness flowing over my tongue, sly subtleties.
Overall, a very nice imperial smoked porter that I would love to have again, but not comparable to De Molens Bloed, Zweet & Tranen or Alaskans Smoked Porter. Dont get me wrong, its good, but just not up there.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3069,"2016-11-27",4.1,"Aroma - has a mix of iron, peat, barley, beechwood smoke, char, jerky meatiness, and slight very subdued herbal nature.
Appearance - the body is black, and the head is around 2"" and khaki in color. The head hangs around for a while. There is good wispy lacing.
Taste - is rich with big, but pleasant smoke. The smoke is similar to what you would get out of fine German Rauchbiers. Im assuming the smoke comes from a fine beechwood smoked malt - the subtle notes of that malt beneath the smoke appear to have some molasses, barley, and some herbs. Overall you get smoke, peat, a slight meatiness (a smoked county sausage), molasses, and a slight roast.
Palate - body is approaching the full mark, texture is somewhat creamy and thick, the carbonation is average, and the finish smoky, meaty, and the faintest touch astringent.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"

3069,"2014-11-07",4.6,"BBD 3/24/19. Yes, the stamp says 2019. Pitch black pour with an average head, below average retention and above average lacing. The nose is charred oak like smoke over a rich caramel sweetness with hints of dark fruit and chocolate. As it warms, light alcohol notes are noted and chocolate becomes more prevalent. Almost full bodied with a very rich creamy texture. Below normal carbonation with almost no effervescence in the finish. The World Class flavor profile is intense, yet masterfully balanced between smoke, caramel sweetness and mild bitterness. It is quite complex from the middle to the finish. It begins with a rush of oak like, rather than bacon such as in the Aecht Schlenkerla Rauchbiers, smoke with a rough charred nature - just like a Smoke Jumper would encounter - that coats the tongue in an oily onslaught. The sweet caramel background, with hints of vanilla and heavy chocolate notes, melds with it and slowly the bitterness and roast characteristics emerge. The exceptional finish is a blending of all previous flavors and the dark fruit characteristics finally get a chance to emerge against a rich chocolate background. As it warms, the vanilla component becomes quite evident in the finish. As everything fades, a nice residual smokiness sweetly coats the tongue and a low level alcohol burn tickles the back of the throat.

Aroma:bottle smells like dark colored smoke, phenol is very heavy smelling of burnt coffee and mild nutty chocolate with a slight hidden hint of caramel, esters in the hops come through as a grassy/wet hay. Smoke overwhelms but a hint of vanilla gets through.

Appearance:Hops, wheat, barley, yeast
Pitch black, caramel head with heavy lacing, next to no carbonation. Poured hard with huge head, settles down to very little head (less than half a finger).

Taste: Very malty taste, molasses taste sits heavy in your mouth along with the coffee on the sides of the tongue. Evolves to licorice and toffee

Palate:incredibly smooth, lighter than expected for its strong aroma, and a bit creamy. Medium high longevity. Slight change from creamy to oily feel after swallow. Feint bitter hop I found appealing as it is present in the middle of your tongue rather than the ""sour"" bitter on the tip of the tongue. Medium body with subtle carbonation. Alcohol is balanced - satisfying warmth and smooth.

3069,"2014-08-05",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 9-12-12-
 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  Served a deep brown colored brew with a small tan head. The head faded relatively fast to leave a light amount of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma is heaviest of chocolate and smoke. Other aromas of coffee, caramel, char, and some dark fruit mix with the former to produce a quite nice smell.

 Taste  The taste begins of roasted malt, dark chocolate, and coffee. Some sweeter flavors of the dark fruit and the caramel that were detected in the nose then start to enter the taste. While these sweeten the flavor in the middle of the taste, a smokiness soon starts to come to the tongue. With the arrival of the smoky flavors the sweet flavors seem to fade and the roasted flavors seem to intensity. This coupled with some char and burnt tastes coming to the tongue, along with a light alcohol taste, overall create a very roasted and warming taste to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the just above average in thickness with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. The thicker and creamier body is wonderful for the dark and smoke flavors and complemented well by the warming alcohol taste. 

 Overall  Quite delicious. It has a nice semi- sweet and smoky porter and one to give a try 
if you have a chance.","","Darkmagus82"

A: Pours black, little head formation. What does form is a think sheet of latte over the surface that runs the throat of the glass. Theres little/no lacing. When light does run through, the beer is excellently clarified. Comes thru mahogany.

S: Smokey! Plenty of chocolate malts, anise backgrounds. Although dominated by the smoke (very much a campfire smoke), beer comes across as well balanced on the nose. Still anticipate quite the smoke bomb here...

T: Much more balanced than anticipated. Good, thick malty beer with a healthy coat of smoke. Some hints of butane and briquette dance in the smokiness. Ongoing malts provide hints of raisin on the finish. 

M: Thick, slicking AND drying. Weird feel here. Not against, but definitely unique. Medium to high carb for the beer.

D: Good beer, but one is enough, and is not something I would likely pick up again.

3069,"2012-11-02",3.9,"Pours a black-brown color with a smallish tan head that soon reduces to a a partial top coat and a sizable, durable, bubbly ring. Some spotty lacing. The aroma is more delicate than expected: a light smokiness over dark chocolate with undertones of molasses and dark fruity. The taste starts rather pleasantly sweet but ultimately proves to be well-balanced in the sweet-bitter dimension, with negligible sourness. Chocolate flavor with subtle hints of molasses and prunes. The smoke is barely noticeable up front, but gently caresses the mid-palate and becomes more obvious in the finish. Smokey, mocha flavors linger for a good while afterwards. Full-bodied; smooth; excellent medium-low carbonation. 

O: I approach smoked beers with some trepidation since I find many of them to be too smokey and, therefore, too 1-dimensional. However, I have learned that there are excellent smoked beers, and this is one of them.

The aroma is of burnt coffee and licorice with a slight spiciness on the back end, kind of like beef jerky. The taste comes out of the gate with an imperial porter feel, roasted malts and coffee, but then closes with the smoked flavor, like eating meat that was thrown directly into the campfire.

S: Not as strong as I would like but theres smoked malts with roasted malts, slightly meat reminiscent. This reminds me of my clothes after a campfire.

T: Smoke throughout is prominent but not intrusive hinting at some smoked meats, mostly on the intro and finish, the mid-taste presents roasted malts and dark chocolate flavors. The alcohol is hidden very well and this is very drinkable.

3069,"2012-05-25",4.1,"32oz Growler from Beverage World in Fort Oglethorpe, GA.  2012 Vintage.  Served at around 45-50F.

Pours black with a two finger brown head that leaves some, but not a lot of lacing and recedes to a small creamy cap.

Aroma is quite smoky.  A lot of smoked bacon & ham, some campfire, but mostly smoked meats.  Underlying notes of chocolate, coffee & roasted malts.  No real hop presence on the nose.  Very good strength.

Flavor is also quite smoky, tons of bacon, ham, smoked meats, but unlike the aroma, the traditional Porter characteristics come through a lot better so there is a good bit of chocolate, brownies, roasted malts, coffee, caramel, a touch of anise and dark fruit.  Some alcohol, but not bad at all for a beer approaching 10%.  

Mouthfeel is medium-full bodied, creamy, sticky, moderate carbonation.

Super smoky!  Tons of bacon!  Mmmmm....bacon....  One Ive been wanting to try for years, passed it up in the past then it disappeared for a while, glad to see Left Hand bring it back this year.

4.0 A: Black color. Two and a half fingers of frothy tan lacing. Retention is pretty good given the ABV and a moderate amount of lacing is left.

4.5 S: So nice. The smoke is really potent. Smelling this is like sitting by a camp fire and eating bacon. Deep caramel notes with a light roast. Smoke is the main focus here and its done to perfection.

4.5 T: Smoke and bacon are the main culprits in the taste as well. Despite this, its as smooth a beer as Ive ever had. Underneath there is a light supple roastiness, a good bit of caramel, and chocolate. The smoke is very well integrated with the base porter and the porter seems like a solid one.

4.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Nice creaminess to go with this.

5.0 D: Any of the nose, taste, and mouthfeel could have received a 5.0, so Ill give it here instead. Really impressed with this beer. The smoke is done better than any other smoked beer Ive ever had. Great job LH!

3069,"2011-04-14",3.4,"Reviewed from notes.

Pours a very dark brown color with a light white head and not really any lacing. The nose brings some smoke along with a bit of roasted malt and some coffee. The smoke is quite nice. The taste is a bit different as I really cant get my head around everything thats going on here. Some smoke and roast plus some coffee and a bit of alcohol. A bit too much that doesnt quite meld. The smoke leads to a nice feel and this ends up drinking pretty well, though there was just something in the taste that didnt quite work for me.

The aromas are smoky and roasty cocoa, a little lactose, and caramel/molasses.  The flavor is roasted cocoa and milk chocolate, slight raspberry, vanilla, and toffee/caramel.  This moves to a slightly bitter espresso, cocoa, and smoke finish, with some lactose evident as it warms.  The smoke notes here complement and enhance the other flavors.

This beer is actually better balanced than I expected. I was expecting a complete smoke bomb but there was a nice sweet silky chocolate malt and lactic creamy presence to balance things out. This thing is still heavy on the smoke flavor with hints of burnt toast, roasted coffee/espresso bean, BBQ, bacon, charcoal, butane ans ash. Not acrid though!

3069,"2009-11-28",3.8,"Serving date: 2009-03-15. Best before: December 2010. Served in snifter.

Very dark brown, almost black. Considering the style and high ABV the the pale brown, thick and creamy head is rather big and leaves plenty of lacings.

The smell is mostly of smoked meat (ham), some sweet chocolate notes, roasted malts. Beneath the massive smoke aromas, light hops are also present.

The taste has some big and powerful, but not overpowering, smoke flavors: smoked meat (ham, bacon), burnt wood/forest fire, charcoal, peat. Some general roastiness. Plenty of sweet flavors as well: chocolate, soft chocolate nougat, light caramel, coffee, some malts. Some saltiness (might be the smoked bacon). Again, faint hops are present. Seems like there is a very good porter base in this brew. The finish is considerably bitter and contains some caramelized sugar, burnt wood and spicy alcohol (however, the alcohol hides rather well). The taste of smoked sausage lingers on for quite a while in the mouth.

Full body, light carbonation. Feels very smooth and calm. It gets a bit sticky after a while.

A very good smoked beer. Complex smoke aromas coupled with an equally complex porter profile makes for a pleasant drinking experience. It gets a little to much after a while though and the palate takes quite a beating. A bomber is just slightly to much, but great for sharing.

Absolutely enticing. Falls in a thick murky dark brown, with plenty of jiggling, creamy sand-colored head. Flavor, again, reminds me immediately the luscious maple-smoked fat on the belly of a piece of lake whitefish, taking me home to Michigans Upper Peninsula. A wash of porter chocolate, ale alcohol, and bright well-complimenting water minerals follow, adding balance and depth. The smoke starts to fade here, giving way to the darker malt characters, some yeast esters, and satisfying alcohol and sugar. The smoke quality is incredible, but its a bit too light for me.

3069,"2009-10-17",3.9,"750mL bottle, vintage 2006.  Poured deeper brown with a thick, creamy, well-set cap of tan head.  The aroma picked up sweet, soft, and salty bacon notes upfront with darker chocolates, molasses, and a little tar behind.. fresh oak and vanilla waft through.. tangy, woody character left the final impression.  The flavor opened with sharp-ish smoke and oaky notes, backed quickly by burnt coffee, molasses, and a touch of tobacco.. salty smoke was laced throughout and amplified by alcohol warmth.. more of the deeply-roasted dark malts and smoke on the long finish with a grainy, earthy and woody bitterness.  Heavier-bodied and quite well carbonated on the palate.. dry and grainy.. just a little sharp at times, otherwise it felt good.  Excellent brew, and I dont think the age hurt it a bit.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

3069,"2009-09-04",4.3,"Bottle shared with the guys at the Inglorious Emergency Tasting. August 31st with Butters. Ill start by saying that this is easily the best Left Hand beer Ive ever had. Its also the best Porter Ive ever had. Nothing comes close. Dark brown in color with a nice silky tan head. Notes of smoke, pork fat, bacon, and beef jerky.  Supple beer. Wonderful mouth feel. Creamy as hell and fat as shit. But it has just enough acid like substance to cut through the fat. Butters is in love. Maybe the best beer Ive ever had..... Part 2 - Okay decided to revisit this beer after we all went crazy over it at our tasting. Im lowering my score .2. The smoke qualities can be overwhelming especially when you first open the bottle. However, the Smokejumper opens up quite nicely given some swirls and a few minutes. If you dont like smoke, this beer isnt for you. However, if you like cigars and beer together, Smokejumper is your new best friend.

Aroma of smoke, coffee, meat, earth, and a little band-aid.  Flavor smoky and roasty with meaty/bacony notes, coffee, anise, and unfortunately a little band-aid too - which a bunch of people disliked, but I thought was not too much of a detriment.  Mmmmm, band-aids!  ABV well-hidden.  Palate fairly full with a long smoky aftertaste.  Its no Alaskan Smoked Porter, but its pretty good stuff.

the smoke in the aroma is beautiful... crafted with care as it is sweet, rich and luscious. that smell lays the ground work for prunes, malt, sourness, roquefort/mineral/blood/copper/iron, moss, earthy/woody and slight umami notes to come through. 

the smoke in the flavor is rich (but mild by the standard) yet not so potent that nothing else is tasted... sweet slowly smoked malt, dark raisins,  bitter cocoa, caramel sweetness, lactose and roquefort show up. cheesey roquefort (maybe point reyes... but definitely the roquefortii strain) is odd but is seems to blend wonderfully. mild hoppy bitterness and lingering parching qualities come on during the finish and aftertaste and there are some mineral notes burped up.

3069,"2009-01-30",4.4,"What a behemoth this turned out to be.  The aroma wafting off the glass reminded me of the scent of burning evergreen limbs in the backyard - not simply woody smoke, but a pronounced fresh-but wood component intertwined.  Great roasted malt backbone that is highlighted with some caramel sweetness, fresh honey, beef-jerky-hickory and spice, and a rich peaty moss earthiness.  One helluva drink.","Washington, USA","19Ei8hty"

Aromas are sweet with a touch of smoke... almost a brown sugar sweetness and a peat and woodsmoke smokiness.  I expected the aromas to be a bit more pronounced.  A bit of a vinous quality and chocolate to the nose as well.  Flavor is a pleasant mix of peat, charcoal and bacon-which is the most pronounced of the smoke flavors until the very end of the finish.  The sweetness from the malt is a little overbearing at times... a brown sugar, fig/prune and mild chocolate presence there.  This is pretty good, but I expected a little more from it.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

Chocolate notes linger in the background but this one is mostly pure smoke - in a good way.  Probably the best pure smoke aroma Ive encountered thus far in commercial beers.  Flavor is full bodied, malty, chocolately with a beautiful smoked finish.  Not overly phenolic.  Smooth, creamy, almost silky mouthfeel.  No astringency.

Due to the abv, it comes across as being a rather sweet beer. Not enough smoke flavor, not nearly robust enough to be rated where it is, however it is a pretty drinkable beer, but the alcohol makes it a bit thin and is missing some body. Pretty decent, but certainly not better than the Schlenkerlas...","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
3069,"2009-01-17",3.8,"Penetrable black chestnut. Thin but creamy and semi-rocky grayish foam. Enticing marriage of beefy yet refined smoke laced with sharp notes of cola, roasted barley (creamed coffee), and charcoal. Hints of nougat, toasted bread, licorice, and an uplifting combination of airy and dried plum esters. Yeast lends an ever faint suggestion of taffy. Expressive carbonation provides for a lively mouthfeel. Bottle conditioned. Briskly chalky, sharp, and dryly roasty, initially, yet densely layered with soft but assertive rauch malt swirled with rich chocolate truffles which swiftly emerge amid the dryness. Malt character is clean and layered beautifully, yielding a charcoal and bittersweet chocolate snap atop a bready and smoky cushion. The cleanness is slightly hampered by some weighty slickness reminiscent of cola-flavored candy and meaty molasses at the bodys core. Still, the savory interplay between the dense chocolate, roasted malt hulls and chalky dryness abbreviates much of this. Black licorice and plummy esters lend complementary effect as they lurk in the background. A metallic and plumlike twang precedes an ensuing smidge of tobacco, salted licorice and smoky phenolics in the finish. A quality, ""best of both worlds"" kind of beer.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3069,"2008-05-12",4.0,"750 ml bomber. Corked and caged.  Pours a deep, deep brown. Appears black until you hold it up to the light. Small off white head with no lace to speak of. Nose is smoky (duh), with roasted malt and bakers chocolate.  Dry mouthfeel with low carbonation.  Taste is same as nose & Ill agree with the majority of other raters in saying that the smoke was not overwhelming. Very good brew.","Wilton, New Hampshire, USA","mcox90"

Coffee, toffee and smoke dominate aroma. Color is very dark almost black with almost no head. Raisin and rum soaked fruit with roast and smoked malt flavors.Noteable hop bitterness and smoke in the finish. Medium body mouthfeel with moderate astringent bitterness. Well smoked and could easilly have been an Imperial Stout if it wasnt so dry. This one would go well with some BBQ.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","MaltDawg"

3069,"2008-04-22",4.0,"Bottle from da east coast beer pimp, Immy.  Thank you kind sir!  The pour was ultra dark brown with slighter lighter hints trying to eek through.  A compact head, tan to brown in color, settled on top but failed to provide much in terms of lacing.  The aroma was rich smoked peat, light chocolate, roasted malt.  The flavor wasnt dominated by the smoke, rather complemented by it.  The smoke mixed with rich roasted malt and softer chocolate quite well.  Nice mouthfeel.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","Soonah"

The aroma is very smoky with only light meatiness to the smoke.  Unfortunately there is still some bbq sauce aspects along with peat.  Medium body with a decent amount of carbonation.  The flavor starts with smoked malt, ash, light char and some dark chocolate.  The finish adds some spice and some smoked woodiness.  This is not really my thing, but pretty good for the style.

Taste is coffee, smoke, and a ham or rib flavor.  This Porter came right off the grill!  This is also probably the thickest ""porter"" I have had.  It clings to the palate and the taste lingers.  It takes a long while to get through this bomber because you want to sip on it and get all the flavors.  I shared this with two other people and we all gave it thumbs up.

3069,"2008-03-06",4.4,"Opaque and inky chocolate black in the glass with a decadent tan crest lying on top. The aroma more than brings out the smoke. Its a prophetic pyromaniac in a glass.  An unflinching summer sun bakes dry leaves on charred shingles. Mocha chips lurk with scorched dark chocolate as smoky oils foil the sweeter aromatic tendencies to virtual bliss. A hint of fatty pepper ignites even further past the olfactory flame. Flavor yields a decadent chocolate morsel with a near melting truffle like center. Charred cinnamon comes in with the broiler along with cocoa and mocha bean grinds finding themselves near the lip of the foreman grill trap. An oily, smoky, medium molasses provides a sweet, slick thickening across the palate. Full bodied and one hundred percent balanced with the best levels of carbonation piped into a 750-ml. on the shelf. Hazelnuts and almond fudge meet a smoky applewood motif and molasses for a finish that came too soon to fathom.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

Pours a deep brownish black with a foamy brown head. WOW, I can smell the smoke in this one. Aroma is fantastic, smoke, chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. The flavor is unlike that of any other beer ive ever had. Huge Smokiness, BBQ, Bacon, chocolate, barley. That said it is difficult to drink more than 1 glass of this beer due to the smokiness, its a bit over the top. Really interesting beer, would be a good base for a smoky flavored cheese fondue, but not an everyday beer for me.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Rusty"
3069,"2008-02-22",3.8,"On draft at Capones.  Pours a cola black with a medium sized creamy beige head.  Lots of lacing.  Aroma of smoked meat, roasted malt and chocolate.  Taste of smoky roasted malt with a hint of chocolate.","Doylestown, PA, USA","adrian910ss"

3069,"2008-02-16",4.1,"Smoked beers are to me a bit of a novelty rather than an everyday beer or a product to be savored.  This beer is definitely an exception to that idea!  This beer is really a very good beer that happens to be smoky.

Appearance is a black body with a tan head.  The appearance of this beer is the most appealing of any smoked beer Ive ever seen; many other smoked beers have little head and this beer looks like any other good porter.  Aroma was smoky and roasty in equal proportions.  Flavor is lots of dry roastiness with a touch of smoke, and quite good.  Mouthfeel is smooth and good.

Id highly recommend this beer.

I got this bottle at Discount Liquor in Milwaukee, and Ill have it again.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"
3069,"2008-02-04",3.8,"Pours a dark brown color that sits with reddish highlights in the glass. Short-lived head of soapy tan foam that recedes to a light ring. The aroma is still big and smoky after a year or so. Assertive aroma of burning firewood/scorched carbon and salty bacon. Slight negative in that the smoke has a slight gassy/lighter fluid aroma. Fortunately the smoke does not entirely dominate, with bready malt and bittersweet baking chocolate. Nice roasted malt and bittersweet chocolate flavors. The smokiness is more subtle than in the aroma. Dry finish of baking chocolate. hops, and smoke. The body starts off smooth, but the carbonation builds and overwhelms the flavor at times. Nice, dry finish. Overall, a tasty porter accented with a nice aroma of smoke. Drinks deceptively smooth for 9.2%","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","jasonm"
3069,"2008-01-29",3.5,"Bottle, provided by Shing. Dark brown, almost black with a thick beige foamy head. Aroma of wood/oak, smoke and some pipe tobacco.

3069,"2008-01-29",3.9,"750ml bottle.  9.2% 2006 vintage.  Bottle pours an opaque dark brown color with a medium brown head.  Aroma is toasted and roasted malts, oak, smoked woods.  Flavor is a creamy malt, with smoked woods, and the same roasted and toasted malts.  I was worried it would be too much like the Smoked Goosinator Doppelbock that I had had, but the ""smoke"" complemented the beer much better.","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
3069,"2008-01-26",3.9,"25.4 oz bottle, 2006.  Dark, but penetrable, brown with maroon edges and a smooth tan head.  Nose is fruit wood smoke layered over plums, prunes and malt.  Even with some age this is still quite bold.  Medium full body, coating with a tangy tingle.  Taste is chocolate and peanut with building grapefruit.  Ending a bit sharp with smoke.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
3069,"2008-01-12",3.5,"Pours a clear dark brown color with a ring of offwhite head. Good aroma and flavor of smoked and roasted malt with a bitter finish. The body is light to medium with a liquorous texture and gentle carbonation.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
3069,"2008-01-06",4.0,"750 ml corked and caged bottle. 2006 vintage. My bottle says 10.5% AbV. Poured a nearly opaque black color. Head was thick and light brown with good retention but minimal lacing. Chocolate dominated aroma with burnt toffee and subdued smoked malt. There was also a whiff of raisin. Delicately sweet on the tongue with distinct chocolatey malt and alcohol flavors. The flavor imparted by the smoked malt was subtle relative to German varieties, but was a nice accompaniment to the chocolate flavor and imparted some bitterness that tempered the sugars somewhat. Delicious beer.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"

3069,"2007-12-30",4.1,"Bottle:  The aroma is a big dose of smoked cheese with a solid chocolate presence as well.  It pours a dark brown with no transparency and a large creamy tan head that leaves behind nice sheets of lacing.  The flavor starts with a moderate dose of chocolate with hints of molasses.  The finish has light-moderate smoke with some light piney bitterness.  The smoke flavor is much lighter than expected based on the aroma.  Medium bodied with a soft mouthfeel.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3069,"2007-12-30",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2008 22oz. bottle.  Thanks to Greg!  Massively smoky, ashy aroma, some roasty, coffeeish malts, huge and powerful with a sweet undercurrent.  Dark brown in color, bottle-conditioned so there is some sediment, head is fine and lasting.  Flavor contains an equally huge amount of smoke but it is infused with dark caramel sweetness and cocoa throughout, some mildly spicy hop tones to be found as well.  The blend of these attributes may not seem exceptional, but in conjunction with one another, this becomes something really special.  Smooth mouthfeel, low in effervescence, body is quite full, some mild warmth noted.  Really indulgent stuff here.  Wow.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

Pours nearly black with a huge brown head that takes forever to subside.  Aroma smells like you just poured a bottle of ""Liquid Smoke"" into a glass of beer.  Flavor is really smoky choco-coffee.  Smoky taste is really powerful.  Taste like that mouthful of smoke you get from the campfire.  Alcohol is fairly well masked.  (by the SMOKE!)  Not bad though","Beech Grove, Indiana, USA","ebarnes"
3069,"2007-12-15",3.9,"Big bottle pours red to black with a nice tan head and good lace that seems to go away after a few.  The aroma starts out smoke house bacon with a hint of malt and some hops make it through.  The flavor has mutilple components that dance all over the mouth.  You have a malty and slightly floral porter in there, but then the smoke comes through only to be followed by a chocolate linger that is really quite nice; perhaps a bit like Mexican Mole - a bit of a stretch, but it really reminds me of one of my favorite sauces.  The alcohol is nowhere to be tasted. The palate is mouth filling, but fresh enough for a nice mild carbonated finish.  I gotta say, this is good.  Id like this with a good steak on the grill.  After an hour or two of this, it is a bit like smoking a cigarette.  Perhaps a bit too much of a good thing.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"
3069,"2007-12-12",4.2,"Bottle from Crown #15 in Fishers, IN. Shared with most of the KC crew at Indras tasting 12/7/07. Pours black with a wispy tan ring around the glass that leaves behind patchy lace. Big, roasted, smoked malt that instantly makes me think of smoked beef brisket. Medium-bodied with a smoky dry finish, the flavor follows the nose with a big, sweet, smoked malt body and a lesser note of faint chocolate malt. This reminds me quite a bit of Alaskan Smoke Porter but with a fuller body. Overall, Id have to say that I prefer this beer, but at twice the cost, I would probably recommend the ASP to anyone that is looking to sample an exceptional smoke beer for the first time.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"
3069,"2007-12-12",4.1,"Poured from a 2006 vintage, caged and corked 750ml bottle and served in a snifter.  This beer poured an oily black with a huge head of tan foam that slowly faded down to a thin, lingering layer.  Heavy lace coated the entire glass.  The aroma of the beer was made up of charred malts, chocolate, coffee, and also a strong note of smoke that saturated the senses.  The flavor included notes of moderate smoke that coated the entire tongue and throat,  dark milk chocolate, and also burnt toast.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied and slightly slick with mild carbonation.  The smoke in this beer was used to enhance the other flavors, not overwhelm the entire drink.  The high ABV was totally hidden behind the smoke and chocolate, only evident by a light warming finish.   A very tasty creation!","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"
3069,"2007-12-11",3.8,"22 oz. bottle shared by Gregis at the 12/7 tasting at Indras.  Pour is almost entirely black, with a quickly fading 1/2 inch tan head.  Aroma of fireplace smoke.

Really well done, thanks for sharing this one Greg!","Kansas, USA","theisti"
3069,"2007-12-09",4.2,"2006 Bottle Conditioned 750ml. Pour is initially very active and bubbly, but quickly settles out into a silky black with a head of swirly mocha lace. Coasts the glass nicely. The aroma is a nice mix of deep peat smoke and chocolate.  The flavor begins with the smoke full and upfront on my tongue. As the flavors swirl and settle, I notice the chocolate more, but the finish come back smoky and a touch bitter. I cant taste any of the significant alcohol.

A powerful nose for a powerful beer and an interesting monster at that. When Left Hand tries hard, what they can do is truly impressive. Solid sweet maltiness procures notes reminiscent of hazelnut and caramel whereas the secondary flavours verge toward almond, roast, chocolate and spicey rye notes. Thick bodied, medium carbonation. Sweet ice cream, vanilla and leather finish. Relatively complex and varying flavour range. Pretty good beer though not that smoky and peaty more than rauchy.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

3069,"2007-10-15",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
Smoked almonds decorate the healthy evening roast in this masterful, nourishing Imperial Smoked Porter. Surely one of Left Hands greatest achievements.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the brown-sleeved black.
-The body is full and beautifully firm.
-Malts develop more than roast and smoke; coffee, dark chocolate and nuttiness even celebrate.
-The only thing left to do is to have a taste-off with Bièropholie Grand Chef. Oh, and buy lots of each.
-This is not good because its big and intense; its great because every flavor is well calculated and ingeniously integrated.

3069,"2007-09-14",3.5,"A nice beer from start to finish, I just wish it had a bit more smokeyness to it than there was. Aroma was dark chocolate a touch of wood, but not nearly enought smokey character in the nose for my liking. After diggning a bit deeper there was a bit of charcoal, and molasses present. Appearance was stunning. Big thick khaki head, solid deep brown color with a garnet hue next to a bright light. Mouthfeel was a bit overcarbonated. Flavor had much more smoke presence that the aroma, but for me it just wasnt enough. I thought Alaskan SP was a much better example of the smokiness in a smoked porter. Some flavors in this beer were smoke, burnt wood, chocolate, toffee and a touch of molasses to round it out. The alcohol content gets kicked up a bit towards the end, which is a bit of a letdown.

3069,"2007-08-08",4.1,"From a 750mL Bottle, 2006 Vintage.  Courtesy of footy.  Bottle opens with a tremendous crack.  Careful pouring reveals a dark black color with transparent edges of root beer brown and a tall head of fizzy charred tan.  Smokey nose with an almost greasy burned pork fat aroma.  Perfumey smoked maplewood coals grilling a pork tenderloin while a skillet of dark chocolate mole sauce simmers nearby.  A pot of dark percolator coffee bubbles next door and the campground dinner is ready to be served.  Medium bodied, highly carbonated mouthfeel.  The bubbles scrub vigorously on the tongue, but the weight and size of the fizz is light enough to be soft, yet not quite creamy.  Some sweet dark chocolate syrup greets the tongue first, softened with a hint of vanilla bean.  This, of course, is buried beneath a layer of damp, smoldering aspen bark.  Hints of earthy black peppercorn shells and toasted coconut husks.  Dark chocolate roast coffee; not overly bitter or astringent, but plenty dry.  Finishes dry and charred, a bit overly so, with a lingering smack of sizzling pine resins.  Very intense smoke flavor with great complexity right away - I find the smoke and dark malt complexities to get lost behind the hops in the dry finish, though.  The body is also slightly overcarbonated and not as supple as Id like it to be.  In spite of this, the flavors and nose are most pleasing overall.  Thanks, Rudy!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Warming ABV without a doubt.  Medium bodied, soft carbonation, dry, smoked bitter finish.  A fantastic smoke beer in my book......not that I have written one...","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
3069,"2007-08-07",3.6,"Very well carbonated, even when poured carefully into my tulip glass it still produces a four-finger thick, brown tinged, dark tan colored head.  The beer is a slightly murky, opaque, dark brown color.  The aroma screams smoke, as even as I pour this beer I can smell the smoke influence.  Ahhhh, the aroma reminds me of my clothes after a night sitting around a campfire; man I love that smell.  Honestly, I am not sure that I can smell anything else but the smoke character; but still I am quite happy to sniff away at this beer for quite some time before I take my first sip.

This beer is fairly well carbonated, but the body is thick enough that it is really hard to tell that.  Malty, with a complex sweetness up front; notes of chocolate and slightly burnt caramel.  This beer is clearly dominated by the smoke character; it does not start to take hold until the beer starts to slide down the throat, but once it does it becomes, by far, the most noticeable thing here.  If you like smoked beers (and yes, I certainly do), then this will be right up your alley.  The smoke flavors provide some spiciness to this beer that mixes in the finish with notes of roast malt, bitter black coffee notes and a certain roast grain astringency.  It is hard to describe, but the smoke character is quite complex here; the smoke adds a sort of sweetness here, some spicy, sometimes hot phenolics in the finish, as well as an inviting, campfire component.  This last is the most noticeable note (though I have the hardest time describing what it is) and is perhaps similar to the smoke flavor a heavily smoked hunk of meat might pick up.

While the Porter character does not hit you over the head, it definitely is a huge part of the flavor profile, it really allows the smoke character to come through quite well without totally dominating this brew.  You will definitely have to be a smoke lover to like this brew though as this beer is just over the top smoky, though not quite one dimensional.  The is very enjoyable & I even wish I had an extra cases of this lying around as this would be a great beer to incorporate into food recipes; and it will definitely age quite gracefully for many years to come.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Fine rauchbier aroma of peat smoke and Virginia ham over some chocolate and roasted malts.  (Honest.  The combination works.)  The high alcohol level is a bit of a distraction in the flavor, my preference being for a more sessionable smoked beer.  Still, the smoke and chocolatey roasted malts are smoothly blended along with a woody, earthy hop bitterness.  The finish is dry and full of smoke.  Not too shabby.","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"

The taste is smoky for sure but I think the balance of nutty and mocha malt and a surprisingly noticeable piney hop bitterness kept this beer very drinkable.

Smell: Abundantly smokey! Beyond the smokescreen, theres some roasted malts, rich caramel, dark chocolate, and smoked sausages.

Taste: Just a little too excessively smokey for me, as for me the imperial porter qualities are smothered under a blanket of smoke, sausages, and chimney sweepings. Sure, theres dark malts, caramel, French Roast coffee, and even some piney hops, but your tongue has to be ready to excavate it from beneath all the smoke.

Flavor balances the ingredients a bit more, and thats even more evident in the second glass.  Dark chocolate and smoke merge as one effortlessly with some licorice just to spice things up.  Finish is holds a lot of woody smoke, coffee, and butter hop flavor.  Actually, the finish and aftertaste are so full and nice they might hold more flavor than the actual beer!  As good as the flavor is, this is one of the best aftertastes and finishes Ive tasted.  This is a pretty creamy beer and somewhat high in carbonation, but the mouthfeel is overall very nice.

3069,"2007-05-15",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 13, 2007 A Mes rate: 
Nice 75cl bottle at Ølfestival 2007. First off I have to say thanks to Henrik for pouring me some of this as it was being sampled at the Mikkeller stand. A true gent. Dark black brown colour with a pretty impressive tan head. Smokey alcoholic porter nose that to be honest is not amazing but I just love smoked beers. Considering the obvious trouble the brewer has gone to to smoke this beer I find it a shame that the smoke is very faint in the flavour. Would have liked it even more if the smoke was a little more assertive. That said the flavour is still pretty impressive with lovely malts, chocolate, slight liquorice and some faint English cheddar from the smoke. Plenty of alcohol showing however and it is just about bearable. Typically American in its lack of finesse but all in all still a jolly fine drop.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

3069,"2007-05-11",4.1,"22 oz. bomber. Ruby tinged black/brown body under a lasting head of creamy tan foam and some slippery lace. The smoke is immediately very evident, although not as smoky as the beer from Bamburgs Schlenkerla Brewery. Addtionally, some maolasses, coffee, and a little chocolate makes a showing, but it all takes a back seat to the smoke. The mouthfeel is rich, creamy, lightly carbonated, with a hint of astringency. Flavor shows some pretty good balance between a malty sweetness and some peppery bitterness. Finishes dry, with some chewiness. If you like smoked beers, this is a good one, and the best Ive had from Left Hand if Im not mistaken.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"

3069,"2007-04-26",4.0,"Pours a dark brown with a big ass light tan head.  Looks thick.  The nose is in fact thick. A significant smoke presence over a big malt backbone with hints of alcohol.  Chocolate malt and some roast definitely sneak in as does just a smidge of grape maybe?  Less emphasis on the coffee, more on the smoke, which I like.  Reminds me of Stone Smoked Porter.  The body is viscous with a good amount of carbonation and just enough carbonation to give this a creamy feel.  the flavor is certainly on par.  Big sweet malt, caramel and chocolate, meets head on with the smoke and the alcohol.  Something resembling bacon about this smoke, like the Schlenkerla Marzen.  the roast is a little more obvious here, getting into charcoal territory, but not overstepping that.  The alcohol is very forward, but I think in a brew with this much malt, not a bad thing.  Theres definitely a fair amount of diacetyl in here, but given the bigness of this brew, its covered up rather well, and in fact smooths this beer out to some extent.  Big round malt up front.  Roast acidity takes hold in the finish, with the acidity turning to alcohol with some floral hops showing up in the aftertaste.  For half the price, which was 11 bucks, Id drink this once a month.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"
3069,"2007-04-26",3.1,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2007 750mL bottle drunk on 4/20/07Nice to see a bottle conditioned left hand beer and the appearance confirms it.  Big, cascading, dark-brown head billows up and recedes very slowly, though only leaving minimal lace.  Medium to medium-high clarity, little, if any sediment on bottom.  Very dark brown body, with an oily/ashy sheen to it and cranberry highlights.Not much smoke in the nose, more like a coffee bean aroma with lots of medium-dry chocolate.  Hard notes of black malt takes things very dry and theres a bit of yeast blandness/doughiness.  Cola and more chocolate, with only a late, very dry woodsmoke-like note coming on the end.  The more I sniff for the smoke, the more Im greeted by lots of chalkiness, doughiness and a very strong overtone of vanilla and somewhat hard coffee notes.  A bit of solvent/glue-like vapors on the end as well.  Medium to medium-strong strength.The body opens up rather watery, with a somewhat loose carbonation and surprisingly light body.  Chocolate-covered coffee beans seem to be the dominant flavor that I get, followed by a little bit of ""day-after-campfire"" notes.  Some oiliness further disrupts any consistency that the mouthfeel could use and dark, roasted malts throw on the coffee bean-like notes as alcohol is strongly persistent on the end.  More smoke comes with warming, a slight saltiness mixing with sweeter chocolate notes, but the alcohol never goes away and the body stays rather light, the carbonation too loose and the beer just seemingly too big for itself.  Too forceful for me, without enough succulent smokiness or ample body to pick up some of the heavily dry, coffee/roasted hardness and alcohol.  Oh, and I forgot the hops.  Theyre poorly done, to say the least.  Bitter, acidic and without much redeeming flavor or aroma, they exacerbate the effects of the alcohol and create a stinging, harsh sensation on the palate.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3069,"2007-04-24",4.0,"From a caged corked 750 ml. bottle with a bottling date of 2006, a blurb on the back, stored at cellar temperature and allowed to warm up a bit before sampling in a pint glass.

Poured a reddish hued blackish coffee brown with a foamy, bubbly tan head that settled into a thin creamy, sudsy lacing, minimal amount of sticking.

Aromas of smoked pork, roasted chocolate and toffee malts, molasses, tannic and charcoal.

Good steady moderate carbonation like you would expect with a decent porter, and a crisp, dry, slick, creamy smooth medium bodied mouthfeel.

This is different, in a good way, from other smoked porters Ive tried by the smoked meat taste at the beginning, followed by burnt chocolate, toffee and caramelized sugar, a little expresso bitterness, charred wood, tannic, while warming in the palate, the alcohol is barely noticeable until at the end when it emerges in the taste, and a dry smoky, malty finish with a lingering earthy bitterness.

3069,"2007-04-23",3.1,"UPDATED: JUN 24, 2013 One of the coolest labels Ive seen in a long time.  Two-color airplane and smoke jumpers diving into a burning forest awesome.   The pour is deep brown or black color, very dark body with a medium dark brown head which settles into a film.  Nose is a bit sweet, thats my first impression, the smoke isnt heavy but the sweet cream and milk notes are probably the most dominant.  Creamy and thick body, slick, chewy texture, with a flavor predominant composed of more of this milky smoked malts and even some coffee and toffee.  Good stuff, mixes the smoked porter qualities well with the imperial porter sweet qualities.  Isnt something miraculous but it certainly tastes good and its very drinkable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

The aroma was of smoked cedar. Had a smokey taste, as expected, with lots of chocolate notes. The alcohol really came to the forefront of this beer. I will say it is rather pricey ($13.99 in TN) so it is not an everyday beer, but a great one to reward yourself with. (If you dont like smokey beer, this one is not for you.

3069,"2007-04-04",3.4,"4-Apr-07  750ml bottle.  Really like the silk screened logo on this bottle.  Beer is deep ruby-brown, blacker towards its depths, with a sturdy, dense, tan head of fine bubbles.  Aroma is at first a nice burst of dusty smoke atop gritty roast and coffee.  With temp, the aroma evolves and less welcome aromas emerge, something, not quite plastic, but it reminds me of that waxy makeup smell like when your grandmother would pop open her compact.  Whatever it is, its not right.  Palate is nice, unctuous, grippingly dry for such a big beer (feels dirty).  I cant decide if the stuff is trying to be rustic or refined.  An acidity lingers, not unlike other big porters, but its lasting with a tongue coating feeling a bit like old coffee.   Alcohol presence is obvious and mildly intrusive as the beer nears room temp.  Smoke is not persistent in the flavor as much as I hoped it would be, but its no slouch, either.  In all, Ive been arguing with myself about this for the entire 750 ml.  Ive had this pegged anywhere between a 2.9 and a 4.0 but I think Im settled somewhere between the two but nowhere near the almost 4.0 average the rest of ratebeer has doled out.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

SmokeJumper is a dark brown brew.  It has an inviting smoky malt and fruit aroma.  The flavor is filled with smoke, but it isnt over the top by any means (actually, I would have preferred a bit more).  The smokiness has a well crafted realness to it and isnt ashy or burnt-tasting in any way.  It is just a nice, smooth, full, and slowly infused smoke quality.  There is also some solid roasted malt and fruity flavors underneath the smoke.  The finish was slightly dry, but the alcohol content was otherwise well hidden throughout.  SmokeJumper has a medium body with an average level of carbonation.  Smooth on the palate.   This is a very well crafted and balanced smoked beer.  Just a bit more smoke next time guys!

1/11/2009:  Left Hand SmokeJumber Smoked Imperial Porter...  Aroma:  Choclate, fruity/caramelized malt, brown sugar, moderate smokiness with a touch of creamy yeast and mocha.  Appearance:  Depp mahogany brown color like the color of heavily caramelized sugar; large, foamy, lasting brown head; web-like lacing marks.  Flavor:  Mild meaty smokiness thats almost barrel char-like; milldly roasty, balanced caramelied maltiness; coffee/mocha-like finish; lightly bitter resin and leafy hops; slight walnut flavor when warmer.  Palate:  Medium-bodied, light and airy on the palate, carbonation level is starting to creep upwards.  Overall:  Fairly well-blended flavors, but needs more smoke for my preference; Would pair nicely with cheeses and chocolate; Smoke barely comes through the flavor after the first few drinks then the beer tastes more like a good porter or stout; the smokiness is more of a roasty/char character and is reminiscent of the rind of smoked cheddar cheese; tastes similar to burnt choclate rather than really being smoky.

Smoked and roasted malts, lightly smoked meats, burnt coffee, and soft dark chocolate. Bit of caramel, as well. Body is creamy and smooth with an everlasting smokiness. Finish is bitter and smoky with more burnt coffee and burnt wood notes, light choco flavors, touch of caramel, maybe even burnt tomato-based BBQ sauce. The is very nice, though Im not sure how well it will age despite its high alcohol content and bottle conditioning.

A nice ashtray smoky phenolic led the charge followed by some strong chocolate and coffee with a backbone of malt. The beer poured clear black with an amber hue and a tall tan head which rose tall and fell slowly to lace the glass. The flavor was malty with caramel and chocolate held in place with a strong smoky presence, like summer sausage. Some espresso coffee was notable with a lightly grassy hop presence behind the smoke and mirrors facade. The body was medium full and with a moderate level of carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. A very well achieved smoked beer with only slight hints at the true alcohol content of the brew, due to how smooth and drinkable the beer actually was.

The first sip is a bit of a surprise, with more a sweetness factor than Id expected.  The more I drink, the more Im perplexed by this beer.

Lovely forward attack with plenty of deep hibachi smoke, roast, chocolate, and thick oily meaty flavors on top of a medium-high body. Tingly bitter finish, more smoke than resin, but a bit of resin in there as well.

The flavor is sweeter than I expected and not as smoky as I would have liked. It is very hoppy, too hoppy I think for what they are trying. Medium bodied. The goos is that it stays true to its porter roots without turning into yet another imperial stout, the only bad is that it is either too hoppy or not smoky enough.

3069,"2007-01-29",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2007 2006 bottle.  Black pour with an enormous, tan, rootbeer-floatesque head; very large bubbles settle leaving a small, frothy remains and minimal lacing.  Nose is rauch with underlying porter characteristics; meaty/smokey notes with earth, burnt dark chocolate, and roasted coffee backing.  After the head dies, the smoked meat note dies down letting the dark malt notes come out better, also noting burnt caramel and anise now.  Flavor is much more approachable once it warms; notes of rauch, wood, dark chocolate, roasted peanuts, light coffee with acidity to match, and burnt caramel.  Bitterness is moderately low but the smoke notes make up for that.  Palate is medium-full, moderate carbonation, and fairly viscous, almost oily.  Finishes mostly dry with rauch, earthy hops, and burnt dark chocolate with mild acidity still lingering.  Nice offering  with the smoke and the porter flavors being complimentary.  For me, it could have used less of a smoke presence to present the other flavors to stand out more, i.e. Stones Smoked Porter.  But Im sure rauch lovers would tell you the opposite.  Not being a huge fan of aggressively smoked beers, this still works pretty well; however, I did find myself liking it much better when the head setted and it warmed to almost room temp.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

3069,"2007-01-15",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 22, 2007 Opaque dark brown pour with a chestnut border. Slowly receding tan head with superb retention. Aroma is at first wrought with heavy smoke, a total surprise, and just what I was hoping for though I didnt know it until this very moment. Parts of the aroma are bordering on the nuances of German rauchbier, like a more full bodied version of Schlenkerla Urbock. Also pleasant is a small hop smell, another pleasant surprise, just trickling through the waves of smoked malt. Flavor is again huge, complex smokiness at the fore. Roasted malts up front, sweet at first and then drying. This beer is very balanced and VERY full bodied. A middle of the road finish(not too oily and sweet, or dry and brash) is quite pleasant. Plenty of smoke throughout but not overwhelming. Left Hands best beer to date? For my money, yes. Warmer temperatures bring about a vegetal character that just adds to the complexity. Excellent.

Anyways, pours a very dark brown, almost black. The head is a nice white with a little bit of a reddish hue to it. The smell, well, I think WOW sums it up. The smell smells like smoke, as I should have expected. It smells like some sort of meat is cooking over a campfire, maybe some pork. Its an incredibly intense, thick smell, much like a wild fire would produce. After the smell, I am a little weary of what the taste may bring, since I could barely whiff the beer without feeling like something was wrong... much like a fire. The taste is not quite as intense as the smell, but it is still amazing. This beer has a little bit of everything. I note a lot of meat still, like pork cooking over a fire as I noted above. I also notice some chocolate, which only compliments the nice meaty flavor. I feel like I am sipping on a nicely smoking piece of meat. This is great.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","cewldre"

3069,"2007-01-08",5.0,"Pours thick and black w/ super full semi creamy froth. Aromas are deeply roasted, smokey sweet malts w/ cigar box and citrusy scents. Like a pine forest ablaze. Full nectar w/ very soft residual effers creating an oily texture. This is one heavily smoked porter. Heavy malt backbone like molasses. Sweet maple, roasted espresso bean, smoked jerkey, cocoa, old leather, and citrus rind. The finish is long and lingering w/ a perfect bittering from the hops that finally kick in. As this brew warms it really starts to balance out. The oily texture turn to velvet and the molasses mellows to brown sugar. Drinks better cool not cold. A killer brew none the less. I scored this perfect classic because of its duality. You get two brews in one. The cold version and the cool version (after its warmed a bit). It would be so easy for a brew of this decandent nature to get lost in itself showing a narrow, straightforward character. But this one pulls it off and really hams up its inherent complexities.

750 big thanks to TheBeerCellar! Pours very dark brown/black with a huge tan head. Man, this stuff smells so good. The bacon, campfire, and meat is strong in the aroma. It doesnt blast my nose, but it is way heavier and fuller than most other pansy smoked beers. Some black chocolate and coffee is hinted at behind all the smoked goodness. The mouthfeel is nice and rich, very even and coating. If the Schlenkerla line could have this kind of palate, those could be the perfect smoked beers. The smoked meat, though strong in the flavor, is a little less pronounced than it is in the aroma. Rich earthy chocolate comes out then fades into bacon, meat, cigars. The more I drink this stuff, the more I go nuts over it.  Sure, I could use more smoke, but this is a very robust beer as it is and everything melds together perfectly while still expoing the meaty ashiness I love. Left Hand really needs to release this again!

22 oz of the new stuff. This is very dark beer, its basically black and sports a nice tan head too. The aroma is smoky and meaty with bitter chocolate. Hops are actually kind of notable too. The flavor really accents the smoke more. Lots of meat, campfire, bacon fat. The malt profile is hefty and creates a nice mouthfeel.

3069,"2006-12-31",4.6,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2007 Pours opaque and black with dark tan head. The aroma is thick with coffee, burnt toast, smoke, chocolate, and alcohol - perhaps hints of chicory, too. The flavor starts off bitter-sweet like an unassuming robust porter or a stout. Some roasted flavors and some sweet malts. The middle of the tongue finds some dark fruit, some chocolate, and some hops. The middle is also where the flavor of smoke begins to fade in. There are also some sweet malt flavors arriving in the middle - like caramel with hints of vanilla. The back of the tongue detects lots of bitterness as well as some alcohol. Really burnt, almost savory, notes, big hop bite (has to be big to make such a big beer taste balanced), and the sting of smokey alcohol all find their way to the back of the throat. The after-taste is full of bitter cocoa, hops, and smoke - and a little alcohol to warm the throat. The after-taste lingers but is mild. The mouthfeel is quite thick, but creamy and sudsy with carbon dioxide. The beer is quite smooth for such a strong beer, pleasantly palatable, and not too terribly smokey (my wife usually doesnt care for smoked beers, but even she was able to enjoy this one). It tasted absolutely delicious with our new years eve dinner of roast leg of lamb with roasted potatoes and red onion marmalade. Overall - excellent.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

3069,"2006-12-26",4.5,"I have liked almost every smoked beer I have ever sampled, and I had always wondered why more brewers didnt give the smoked treatment to their one off releases.  Almost reading my mind, the newly released corked and caged bomber of Left Hand Smoke Jumper Smoked Imperial Porter appeared on the store shelves of Bullocks in Marietta, Georgia.  I uncorked it without bothering to refrigerate it first, and the loud thud and the free forming head inside the bomber made me realize that had it been a few degrees warmer, and I would have had a geyser on my hand.  The beer looked opaque black with dark brown highlights when held up against strong light.  The large khaki head was impressive when taking into account the double digit ABV.  Inhaling the headspace over the beer revealed that the standard Imperial Porter aromas of coffee, chocolate, and roasted grains had been overlaid (or almost overrun) with the wonderful aroma of wood smoke.   The taste exhibited an assertive smoke treatment, which went well with the other bold flavors of chocolate, toffee, vanilla, and bitter hops.  More a stout than a Porter if you ask me, as there was little to no sourness, and the taste was more bitter than sweet, but take this as an observation and not a complaint.  Body was quite chewy, and the alcohol was warming in the belly (as if there was a real fire in here to go along with all the smoke).

3069,"2006-12-16",3.8,"This one pour an oily black color with a huge tan head that takes for frickin ever to die down. Aroma is intriguing. You get obvious smoke on top of a chocolatey American style Imperial porter scents. The flavor is very much a roasty burnt coffee flavor with hints of chocolate and Blackstrap molasses. I think the smoke flavor is what makes the coffee notes seem burnt. I like this one but I could actually do with more smoke and subdued chocolate hints.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"
3069,"2006-12-10",3.6,"750. Beer is very dark brown, nearly opaque with a large-to-huge, frothy, light brown, diminishing head.<P>
Camp-fire heavy aroma. Its malty with a moderate notes of shortbread, toasted grain, light note of caramel; Hoppy with a light note of resin/pine; Light miscellaneous note of underripe banana.<P>
The flavor is heavily sweet, moderately-to-heavily bitter, moderately acidic with a long, moderately bittersweet finish. Lots of campfire in the retros.<P>
The body is full, the texture is velvety and the carbonation is lively.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","luckygirl"
3069,"2006-12-10",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 5, 2009 Bottle (2008 batch). Head is initially average sized, frothy, brown, mostly lasting. Body is dark brown to black (not opaque, flashlight tested). Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, chocolate), lightly hoppy (resin, apricot), with notes of smoke, ash, and vanilla. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, creamy/velvety texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Much improved from the overly-hoppy 2006 batch.  Thank you, Left Hand, for letting the malt and smoke shine through this time.  Still lacks nuance and finesse in the nose, but overall very rich and satisfying.  Good stuff.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
