481,"2013-09-23",3.7,"A red brown drak beer, with a good light brown firm head. In the nose there is soft warm coffee smell, and a touch of smokiness. It is a medium to light bodied beer, with a decent carbonation. In the taste there is a hard and strong dominant coffee taste. There is also a little sweetness what makes the beer soft and round, but it is at an distance. In the aftertaste there is strong coffee and hops. A decent stout, but a bit monotone.

Surprisingly hop forward aroma for the style with a strong earthy pine presence thats countered by sweet and roasted dark malts. Prominent spicy, grassy hops with hints of pine needle and spruce tip followed by dark chocolate, caramel, coffee bean and toast. As it warms, the malt characteristics come to the forefront but it still has too strong of a hop presence for my preference. 

On the fuller end of medium bodied with a strong earthy hop presence that slightly overpowers the complex malt profile. Dry and bitter with lots of resinous pine and spicy, grassy hops that linger over the sweet and roasted notes into a bone dry finish. As it warms, the malts become stronger with hints of burnt toast, dark chocolate, robust coffee bean, caramel, toffee and oatmeal but the hop bitterness still dominates. A bit one dimensional with lots of bitterness and almost acrid roasted malt. The ABV is well masked but it could use some sweetness for balance. This is supposed to be a toned down Hr.

In long: Nose has a bit of everything for the style, roast, raisins, chocolate, coffee beans, hops resin.  Taste is more of the same, once again with all of the most common flavor elements found in stouts.  Roast, coffee, raisins, a slice of chocolate cake, soft black liquorice candy, toasted oat (although I dont if any oat is actually used).  Just the perfect amount of herbal resinous hops to balance the beer.  This is a 7% beer that drinks like a 5% session stout.  A very sessionnable big stout, too easy to drink if you ask me, because every week-end when I wake up I find a bunch of empty beer bottles around my couch that I dont remember drinking.

A Breakfast Stout for sure, closer to Mikkeller Beer Geek Breakfast than what you would think. Less hoppy though with the hops more camouflaged in the palette of flavors.

481,"2011-08-16",3.8,"A lasting, delicious tan head settles over the blackness. Uncompromising aroma for a 7% brew, feeling bigger than its real strenght. Coffee roast and liquorous berry-like fruitiness dominate subtler rooty, woodsy, spicy undertones and a fair bit of earthiness. The gentle residual sugars never limit drinkability, alcohol is kept well under control. This makes for a drinkable, albeit substantial, softly oily brew. A more than honest leafy, lightly citrusy and almost green bitterness closes it all, hands in hands with the roast and adding a bright freshness to the ensemble.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
481,"2011-08-15",4.0,"My Bottom Line :  
This Stouts voluble dark malts develop coffee, raisins, roast and chocolate for a diverse and comfortable example of the style. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A slice of foam decorates the brown-edged blackness. 
-The malt display is reminiscent of Hill Farmsteads wondrous Everett!
-The body is silky, wealthy but not heavy. 
-The finish is almost soft, especially considering the talkative nature of the malt profile. Makes it all the more drinkable, actually.
-Light licorice creates even more depth.
-Resinous hops tag along the roasted malts in the bitterness and aftertaste. Residual sugars dont envelop this finish, which is appreciated.
-This is yet another excellent dark brew from Amager!
