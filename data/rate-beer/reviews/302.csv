302,"2016-12-15",3.7,"Two 12 oz. bottles from Liquor Barn (Jefferson Commons); bottles dated 12/1/16, so at least three weeks past its prime.  A brief forward on Zombie Dust: This is a beer that Ive sworn never to chase. Ive never stood in some stupid long line for it; Ive never went to a place where it was on tap just to try it... Ive always figured that the hype would wear down enough to grab some one day (Three Floyds has pretty regular distro in Louisville, after all) or that Id be fortunate enough to drop by one of my regular stops and buy it like a regular human being. Anyway, that finally happened, so here goes.  Aroma: Moderate, gently juicy citrus and lesser floral accents; malts are mostly off dry, basic cereals. Appearance: Slightly hazy copper with soft carbonation holding up a foamy bone head that settles into a cap. Flavor: Gently juicy citrus mingle with cereals and has just the right amount of sweetness to accentuate each other; expectedly more dry and floral towards the finish, which is lightly bitter. Palate: Medium body, sticky texture, soft carbonation, bitter finish. Overall: Very well done, as expected. I like that Three Floyds isnt afraid to allow some malt sweetness in a tastefully balanced way, as the current trend is towards an almost parching dryness that can be off-putting when overdone.  So, is this beer worth the hype? At this point, there are so many other well-made Citra hopped pale ales that this might be a bit redundant in the current market. Still, this beer is to Citra what SNPA is to Cascade; or what Two Hearted Ale is to Centennial. For that, its place in beer history was long assured before I had poured my first glass.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"

No problem with my sample - definitely fresh, definitely what the brewer intended. Aroma of sweet malt. Clear medium amber, white head that quickly reduces to a cover, lace curtain. Taste is caramel malt, but it is assaulted by dominant hops in a medium fizzy swallow. The hops push on single handed to a finish that doesnt even have a memory of malt.

302,"2016-08-20",4.0,"Draught pint at The Rock in Beloit, WI, August 17th. Translucent, oily-slick medium amber color, bit of smooth head thats fully lasting, a bit of chunky lacing in the glass...powerful, mostly fruity aroma - grapefruit and orange initially, mixed with old dry cedar, like my moms 60-year-old cedar chest interior...eventually a big wallop of mango intrudes and almost pushes everything else aside...on the tongue, the mango is there all the way; this is much sweeter than the Karben4 Dragon Flute which I had just had, and generally a slightly sweeter, fruitier character is more to my taste with an APA, though I still treasure a balanced body, and a bit of lightness which tends to be more common with the drier versions...in this case, the fruitier and sweeter example is actually a bit easier to drink, and if its a bit skewed to the honey-velvet on the mouthfeel, its also a bit less fatiguing to gulp down a pint on a hot day, being just a touch thinner...in the end, both were pretty excellent, though amongst APAs Ive had recently Id give the nod to PseudoSue, or Edward.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
302,"2016-08-19",4.5,"Golden ale with some lacing and tight bubbles from bottle conditioning lead to an easy medium light mouthfeel. Aroma of citrus and slight pine hops with sweet hay malt tones. Great hop flavors come through immediately. All hops on this. Citrus, a touch grassy, a touch herbal for balance, a little piney, and quick to the bittering. Fills your whole palate, but restrained enough to not overkill your taste buds. Bitterness starts right away and continues through the sip. Enough malt to carry the hops without muting. Almost Unbelievably easy to drink, but a ton of flavor. Malt comes back for a flash at the end to keep it easy to drink. Just under a bit of juiciness of the hop. Dry finish keeps it clean. Must try. Equal flavor and bittering brings a great balance.

302,"2016-07-09",3.9,"12 oz. bottle, consumed on 7-7-16. Bottled on 6-15-16, so its about 3 weeks old. Pours a clear (although hazy in the final pour) bronze with a large amount of creamy, cream to beige-colored head. Nice shade and good head. Good, long-lasting lacing as well. Citric-hoppy aroma. Orange scent. Also, to a lesser extent, lemon. Surprisingly subdued smell, but whats there is nice. Lemon and gym bag funk in the flavor. A bit briny. Blood orange. A touch of vanilla. Clementines and cream. Pencil shavings in the finish. Nice, tasty, Citra hops flavor. There are enough beers with this flavor and aroma profile now for this one to stand out the way Im sure it used to, but its still pretty darn tasty, enough to make me give it a 9 in flavor; there are few beers, especially at this ABV level, that are simply this delicious. In fairness, it was borderline between an 8 and a 9 in my mind, but I decided to be generous. Light to medium body. Smooth in the palate. Ordinary palate effects. Marketed as an APA but functions as a very nice, single-hop IPA. I can see why people went gaga over this a few years ago. The surprisingly subdued aroma (especially for a 3-week old Citra-hopped beer) seems like a missed opportunity for this one to be a true great.

Light medium body that is smooth in texture with a oily slickness. Very good carbonation / body balance with a mildly effervescent middle and a prickly finish.

The flavor profile is quite outstanding. Being single hop, it is not complex but it is reasonable in intensity and very well balanced. It begins with a blended flavor that separates, to a degree, from the middle on. First is a general citrus flavor that hints at zest then flows to a mildly bittered middle. Bitterness is balanced by a subtle sweetness underneath that never really takes center stage. From here the tropicals arrive...mango, pineapple and finally orange. Throughout the taste experience is a subtle earthy dank current that makes its strongest showing just before and through the finish. The finish lingers with a light dryness and zest.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

302,"2015-07-31",4.1,"Pours a slightly hazed sunyellow color, with a big, stable head.

Smells of sublime bitter, fruity lemon zest with balancing, white-bread malts to it. Citrus got a flowery, inviting note to it, enhancing the beers juicy, ripe lime pulp impression. 

Drinks outstandingly easy, with a medium, soft carbonation to it, resulting into a very pleasant, citrus forward pale ale. 

Tastes of citrus peel from the very beginning, while the malts provide a fantastic soft mouthfeel, exhibiting a hint of honey, as well as juicy lime. Also yields a soft minerality, creating a very clean and crisp hop profile, showcasing the pungent exotic fruit perfectly. Finishes with biscuity malts among an aqueous softness and pleasantly metallic carbonation, together with a well weaved in citrus hoppiness, which shines during the very end of tasting the beer.

While its hoppiness provides a pleasant assault on the tongue it is perfectly integrated and balanced by all other ingredients of the beer. This creates a great softness on the palate, resulting in an outstandingly easy drinking beer, for which you dont necessary need to be a hophead, more of a beer which convinces you to be one.","GERMANY","aleigator"

302,"2015-05-04",4.6,"A friend brought back a six-pack to Hong Kong for me while this was still super fresh in February. Obviously there are times where I just like to sit back and enjoy a beer instead of always reviewing and as it is, two and a half months on, Im down to my last bottle and so heres the review. This 12oz bottle was bottled on 13 February 2015 and poured into a pint glass. The beer poured a slightly hazy golden orange colour with a nice one and a half finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly leaving nice stringy lacing. Intense aromas of tropical fruits especially pineapple and mango hit first, followed by some citrus grapefruit and a hint of bready malts finally ending with some hoppy pine. Much like the smell, there was tropical pineapple, citrus grapefruit, some bready buscuity malts and a very nice bitter finish. Very crisp, light and with medium carbonation. Overall, I had high expectations before trying it and it lived up to those expectations. It was a very easy APA to drink and this is a must buy if available for me. It was best when it was freshest.

Aroma pungently fruity citrus, dank and almost funky citrus peel blend, ripe mango, orange flesh, hop leaves, tropical melange etc, smells great. On the plate, just a touch of caramel sweetness to hold lots of citrus peel and flesh and mango, little papaya and pineapple, seems like more tropical stuff I cant identify, a little dank. Drier towards the finish with citrus oils to the fore, fairly light bitterness and a resinousness that is more like aforementioned oils than typical hop bittering. Average mouthfeel with moderate carb. Just a bit more malt than most APAs but still totally aromatic hop focused with restrained bitterness. Some citra beers seem a little one note but this was really lovely, great fruit flavours with the quality expected from Three Floyds.

302,"2015-01-06",4.6,"Overall, probably one of the best IPAs out there from midwest breweries (ehhem mad shouts out to Dark Horse Crooked Tree). Ill start with the the downside(s), which is a short list. 1. They do not make enough of it. It is incredibly hard to find. Obviously this isnt against the quality of the beer, just a general annoyance that lingers when one approaches the experience of the zombie dust. I wish I had a ""I am incredibly happy I finally found anouther six pack of this beer"" feeling but I dont. It sours the mouth. 2. The aroma belies the actual complex and satisfying experience of this beer. Contrary to what it is held out to be, I found the aroma to be a sterile and trite PA smell: some je ne sais quoi PA smell--citrus, pine, whatever, something indicative of PA. The taste is another story. It accomplishes what it sets out to do: be an american pale ale, but does so with an unabashed americanism that will rejuvinate the dead parts of your soul, hence the name, zomie dust. Hints of caramel, cooking bread, nuts, and almost roasted coffee beans combine into what almost turns into drinking candy with a satisfying bittered finish--literally due to the hops but also due to the fact you wish you could keep drinking this beer forever. It also has a good ABV too at 6.2% for everything it accomplishes in the taste and look dept. w","","barristersbrew"

The flavor doesnt move on from this, and it isnt what I remember in this beer. Its all pungent, garlic and green vegetables, seedy spices, salts. Crusty bread, healthy minerals, and distant citrus pith cant compete with the weirdo herb-salt thing that still leans toward celery, dill, and cracked bitter seeds.

Black tea like texture, with mild carbonation and slick, acidic body. Sugary mid palate, syrupy bittersweet finish.  Bottling date shows 09/19/14 and it seems incredible that so little time could affect this so much.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

302,"2014-05-31",3.8,"Draught at Local Option, 4/18/14Mostly clear (slight chill-haze) very pale blonde beer with a small but well-retained white head.Grass, nectarine, watermelon, orange peel; such things as youve come to know (and love?) from ye olde citra hop...Honestly, Im pretty middle of the pack on my support for citra. Its fine, probably a lot more aromatic than flavorful. The flavor leans too much towards cat pee, dry, acidic, near-astringent citrics and cheesey, leafy earthiness at its worst. At best, the citrus is still a bit overpowering, though the tropical fruit notes it provides are very enjoyable and can be quite complex.This pint seemed very fresh and the nose was grassy, dusty, citric and had light pale malt sweetness and doughiness on the backend. Clean, no alcohol and a medium-high to high strength of aroma. Of the IPAs I had this weekend, I will grant that this probably had the freshest, juiciest, strongest aroma. So far so good...The flavor delivers much of what the nose promises; citrus, grass, soft pale malts, touches of dough and honey. Some light astringency/dullness from either the hops or yeast (though the beer seemed quite bright, so I was a bit surprised by this). Only a touch of resin on the finish, coupled with a moderate amount of bitterness and tons of lemon and orange zest flavor. Mouthfeel is a touch watery, appropriate for a session pale but the carbonation is ample and not overdone while the sugars are well-attenuated.

After it settles a bit, more of a fresh baked bread crust and tangerine comes through, and even later, the bread crust turns more towards a blackened pizza crust. It pours a slightly hazy copper-orange color with a creamy white head that retains well; it leaves a thick puffy ring with a creamy island and a decent, messy lace along the glass. Great balance between medium high levels of sweet and bitter. The texture is creamy on the palate with a body towards the higher end of medium. The carbonation is a touch effervescent or fizzy, but overall, soft. There?s a very pronounced grapefruit tartness up front, but it mellows quickly after the first few sips. It finishes with a zesty combination of lemongrass, caramel, and stonefruit. The aftertaste is primarily sweet, overripe tangerines and it?s peel with a tart grapefruit bitter lingering in the mouth.

Pretty excited about trying this one. Im going to be as partial as I can though. Pours a beautiful murky golden orange with a one finger white head that seems to be holding up well. Aroma hits you right as you open the bottle and start pouring it. Apricot, tangerine, pineapple, pear, honey, and pine sap. The aroma is about as good as it gets for a pale ale.

Palate: Soft bodied with mild carbonation.
Overall: Boy for all the hype this receives Im wondering why people dont just homebrew. You could brew a similar beer to this for $40 or so whenever you want it. I have a homebrew that I thought I fucked up, an all Citra pale ale, and nope it just isnt a hop profile I love like I thought I did. This isnt bad by any means but hell its not even close to being hard to replicate this on any level and the hop profile is definitely something you better enjoy if its all youre using.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Lightly hazy light golden-amber in color with a very fine, lasting head of white. Flavor profile is very nicely balanced between the leafy, fruity, juicy, citric hop flavors, mild degree of toasty malt sweetness, and the light-moderate levels of hop bitterness, drying out nicely at the finish, providing a very refreshing feel.

6.4% ABV 60 IBU

APPEARANCE: poured a hazy burnt amber with an off white pillowy head. Lots of sticky lacing. 

AROMA: Very dank, herbal and hoppy. Bright fruits, grapefruit lots of lemon. Hints of wet grass, bready malts on the backend. 

TASTE: Lots of grapefruit on the front. Very oily like a zombie stirred this with his finger. Citrus notes pop again in the middle with the hops before finishing with Carmel and pale malts. 

MOUTHFEEL: medium body with medium carbonation. Slick and oily with snappy finish that leaves you wanting another sip. 

OVERALL: I had to keep reminding myself this is a pale ale. It drinks wonderfully and has such a good hop presence that it could be a mellow ipa. Lived up to the hype that surrounds it. The art work is amazing!

On tap at brewpub in Munster.
The appearance is a hazy orange/brown body, slightly clear, one finger white foamy head dies within thirty seconds, some carbonation is seen rising at a moderate pace.
The smell has a strong citrus and piney hops through sweet and bitter tones, becomes slightly floral
The taste has a super strong sense of bittersweetness combined very well all throughout the drink, bittersweet aftertaste and a dry floral finish.
On the palate, its about a light to medium, shows a nice sessionable quality to it, very smooth, well carbonated for the style and for me.

Pours a very hazy deep amber with sizable amber tinged fine cream head. Initial aroma is fantastic with freshly crushed pineneedles and sweet mangoes, though this subsides somewhat on standing for a while. Initial mouthful is a pithy fizz bomb but as it warms out comes some lovely rounded seville marmelade, pinenes and a warming base of orange shortcake all in all working fairly well. Full bodied and sweetyet pithy finish. I can see why this rates so highly.","NORTHERN IRELAND","Beersiveknown"

Zombie dust is an alpha king lite in my professional opinion.

Too much hype associated with the name.

It didn't live up to my expectations.

Availability should be better.

 I think the kids with gaged earrings and tattoos just drink this beer because of the art work on the label and the name.

302,"2013-08-17",5.0,"Pours a slightly hazy amber with billowy off-white head that dissipates quickly. Good lacing. It looks like a world class ale in the glass. The nose is all hops. Intense tropical fruit aromas with a whiff of grass and lemon. Bitterness at the front of the palate gives way to a malty middle that finishes with a floral, lemony hoppiness. Light bodied with great carbonation make this a very refreshing pale. Overall this a well crafted pale, complexity to rival the best DIPAs on BA with an ABV low enough to make it just about sessionable, a most impressive achievement. Perfection in a glass!

302,"2013-04-29",3.9,"12 oz bottle, thanks Ryan.  Almost unnoticeably hazy amber; very large white, frothy, rocky head dissipates into a sparse covering and a medium to large ring; heavy lacing.  Aroma is warm and toasty with sweet malt, grapefruit, pine sap, and barely a hint of caramel.  First taste makes me think this is going to be another unbalanced hop bomb, but over time this thing really smooths out; more pine and citrus here but it gets more drinkable after sitting a bit; very lengthy orange/pine finish with light caramel.  Really impressed with the body; heavy carbonation but its full and smooth and almost creamy; light stickiness; does thin out a bit after sitting out once the carbonation bleeds out.  The 100/100 score on this one suggests a great number of raters are on drugs, but this is outstanding and probably really does deserve 99th-100th percentile in the APA category. (But 100 overall?

A huge grapefruit nose overpowers any other aroma, which isn't a bad thing really.

302,"2013-04-02",4.8,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2014 If you had to pick one American Pale Ale to try before you die, try Zombie Dust. Not only does it have amazing artwork, you are literally left in the dust from this beer and chasing to try more. Upon taking in the aroma, you smell apricot, grapefruit, and other tropical fruits. The alcohol is not very noticeable.
The taste is grapefruit mixed with mouth watering hops. Little did I know that there is only one hop used: Citra hops. The palate is warmed but not overwhelmed. tropical fruits come through once again. The best thing about this beer is the after taste which begs you to drink more, and more. It is satisfying to a crisp. For IPA fans, this is not a bitter beer. It is strong enough for you to enjoy though and should be tried if you live in Indiana. Having been to the brewpub in Munster many times, Try it straight from the cask and you will not be disappointed. Tap is good as well as bottles, but the cask seemed absolutely the best. The fruit flavors are at their freshest and shine though. Do not try if the bottles are more than a week old, as you will not have the same tasting experience. This one particular hop used tastes best fresh in this beer! Hope this helped. Try if you can, and remember this: if will leave you in the dust begging for more.","Indiana, USA","CpyNPrnT"

302,"2013-03-20",4.6,"At long last! Finally, Ive had the legendary Zombie Dust.

Appearance: Pours a typical APA color -- light orange. Theres a slight haze, and a nice, creamy-like head on it. Lacings patchy and not all that great, but it looks nice as a whole.

Smell: Think Hopslam. It smells a lot like that. Zombie Dust is tied with Hopslam as the best beer that I have ever smelled ... absolutely outstanding. A huge burst of guava/peach/citrus along with some sweet hoppiness. Glorious.

Taste/feel: Slightly letdown, though its still an insanely tasty beer. The aroma is stronger than the taste, but thats not necessarily a terrible thing. Like many have said, this drinks more like an IPA than an APA... super tropical fruit flavors along with non-descript fruit and spice on this one. The aftertaste is slightly bitter, and the alcohol comes through a bit at times as well to dry the mouth, but me gusta. A proper amount of malt and spice on the finish to balance it all out pretty nicely. A great, GREAT beer, but a tinge overrated in my opinion, and I wouldnt consider this a very sessionable beer (besides the 6.40%) due to the dryness.

For the price, an unbelievable beer, and one of the best... $1.50 a bottle, fresh from the brewery? Doesnt get better than that. Overall though, just an extremely good beer. Best beer ever? No, but close to it. Honestly, I feel like this would score slightly lower on a blind taste test. I think a good reason this beer is so acclaimed is because of its label, and especially, its name... Americas become obsessed with zombies the past few years.","Michigan, USA","Alextricity"

12 oz bottle poured into a beer mug.

A: Pours an intensely cloudy orange-copper color. The head is a one finger white color with some fantastic retention - its been about a minute and the head is still there

S: Theres no doubt this zombie is but a shadow of its former self, though it has held up well enough to be pretty good. This has a lot of papaya, mango, and honeydew melon, along with a piny brightness. I also detect a very subtle sweetness to it.

T: Extremely good for a six month old pale ale. Most of the bitterness is midpalate; the opening flavors are melony and sweet, while the finish is wonderfully neutral and bready. Nonetheless, this offers a decent melange of tropical fruits. If only it were fresh *sigh*...

M: This feels a LOT lighter than it looks, and goes down with amazing ease. Carbonation is perfect for what this beer is, perhaps a hair too light. The finish is surprisingly wet, likely due to the (un)dead hops.

O: I really like it - but it pains me to review it in this state, given the circumstances. On the plus side, I could really see this being one of my favorite beers EVER fresh, so needless to say, Ill be on the hunt for fresh bottles of this!","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

To be honest, I had tried this beer once before at my wifes fancy birthday dinner, but it would have been in poor taste to take notes so I never rated it. Bright orange-gold with a medium frothy white head that leaves light lace. Aroma is bracingly hoppy, with a bouquet of tropical fruit and tropical flowers. Juicy fresh fruity hop flavours charge onto the tongue, bright guava and mango, and a slightly piney quality that is more mango-skin than conifer. Despite the flavour intensity, the palate retains a lightness and relatively low bitterness that encourages drinkability. The supporting malt base is just enough to provide the right structure and sweetness to allow the elegance of the hop profile to truly shine.

Nice medium body.  Really enjoyable stuff.","Minnesota, USA","mattyb83"
302,"2012-12-02",3.7,"Aroma is definitely one dimensionally Citra. Lots of tropical citrus notes and sweet oranges, but also the Juicy Fruit character that comes through when Citra finds itself without company. Light resin notes, but not much malt to balance. 
Pours a fairly clear golden copper. second pour is much cloudier. 
Flavor is pretty sweet with some malt notes, but is dominated by Citra. Bitterness is medium to medium high. The caramel notes from the malt do help balance the hop flavors in the front of the taste. The hip resin is more noticeable in the flavor, especially the finish. Mid taste is when the Citra shines - not too Juicy Fruit, not too much resin; just clean bright citrus. A bit sweet for my palate. 
Overall this is a really nice beer, but it proves why I don't think Citra works by itself. It needs a touch of some other hop to balance it. I also feel that if a beer is dominated by Citra it should finish drier to counteract the perception of sweetness that the Citra adds.

Live tasting 12 oz. bottle into Delirium tulip, bottle thanks to Peacehammer (see ya Thursday!)

Appearance; pours a lovely slightly hazy light orange/amber color with a finger of slightly bubbly pale straw colored head. Retention is good, and the head falls after a few minutes. Lacing is great with a ton of lace clinging in sheets to the sides of the glass.

Smell; holy grapefruit Batman!!! Zombie Dust features grapefruit by the ton, notes of pineapple and hints of resinous pine weave in and out. 

Taste; wave upon wave of grapefruit upon grapefruit washes over my tongue. As with the smell, pineapple and resins are beautifully interwoven with the grapefruit. Slight notes of orange and lemon rinds also appear.

Mouthfeel; a medium bodied beer, with just enough carbonation to compliment the feel of the brew. Might be a tad on the lighter side for this style but Im sure not gonna complain about that.

Overall; WOW. An outstanding pale (PALE?!?!) ale that I would definitely stack up against any standard IPA, and quite a few DIPAs. There really isnt anything pale about this brew.

Fairly bitter, lightly sweet, with that bitter hop-resin sticking and getting a bit more intense in the aftertaste. Juicy citrus girding that bitter structure, but not as much as the aroma promised. Medium-bodied, not as dry as some, but that resinous bitterness makes it seem drier. When did IPAs of 6.4% become APAs exactly?

Less of the great tropical fruit compared to the nose, but more lemon grass, strawberry, and melon starburst candy. Also, caramel and malted cereal with some light soapy qualities.

Use cenotaph in a Sentence:

I sure do enjoy sharing this growler of Three Floyds Cenotaph!

Growler shared by Thorpe429 and Amyliz4. Thanks Mike and Amy! Served alongside Hill Farmstead Citra IPA.

A: Cenotaph appears a slightly hazy shade of light orange, with an inch of white head that generates some great lacing upon the pint glass.

S: Citrus and hops. Very fresh and wonderfully inviting.

T: Fabulous taste, with a healthy dose of citrus, à la Citra hops. Extremely delicious and hop forward.

M: The feel was nice, with a decent showing of hop bitterness in the finish.

D: Very solid IPA. I would be happy to drink this again.

Edit: February 2012
Recently made my way through a case of this with the help of some friends. Absolutely phenomenal beer. Right up there with the best hoppy beers in the world.

Serving type: growler

302,"2012-08-01",3.7,"Tap at Durty Nellies served in a shaker glass. Honey colored pour with a white head that laces well and reduces to a thin, but lasting film on top of the brew. Very Earthy hop aroma. Taste is full of hops. A perfect blend of Earth, citrus, and pine. Big time Amarillo flavor. Way out of balance toward the hop side of the spectrum but I know that's the appeal of this beer. Thin body.

302,"2012-07-31",5.0,"Pours a nice dark straw color slightly amber. Incredible nose to this beer when its fresh, beautiful citrus, fruit and floral notes with some sweetness, kind of like a nice mountain breeze, I could almost just sit here all day and smell the nose, had I not then tasted how ridiculously good this beer is next. The taste is so well balanced with the hops it makes this by far the most drinkable beer Ive ever had. Sweet but not too sweet, bitter but not to bitter. The malts are a slight caramel mixed wonderfully with citrus notes of the hops. Just an incredible example of the pale ale category.","Denver, Colorado, USA","prosper0"

Huge piney hops with tons of honeydew, tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, and black pepper all over the place.  Definite 10 for nose.  Tastes rich, complex, with huge pineapple, tangerine, honeydew, grapefruit, black pepper, and the full profile of my favorite hop, Citra.  If I ever remarry, it will be to a Citra hop cone.

302,"2012-05-31",4.3,"Pours a clear gold color with a 1 finger white head consisting of tight bubbles.  Aroma is very citrusy, floral.  Very impressive aroma.  First sip lands me gentley in a field of flowers in bloom, poppys, iris, lillies, and then suddenly an orange falls off the tree and hits me in the head.  More and more citrus fruit keeps falling, until I look like Carmen Miranda.  Beautiful.  A strong malt backbone holds this all together until the bitter end.  Very well executed beer, and deserving of its high ratings.","Victor, New York, USA","MacBoost"

302,"2012-05-29",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 2, 2012 Holy sh**!! Now, this is what I call a nose. Fresh fruits, citrus peel, trident gum, trolli gummi peach rings, pepper and other spices, floral undertones, caramelized sugar, and a faint whisper of eucalyptus. The body is almost thick for an undead pale ale, very good. On the tongue, the flavors are endless, sharper than those of the Alpha King, but just as good. The parade of bitter and sweet ends with slight funk and leaves a fresh, sugary, citrusy aftertaste under the palate. Speaking of the AK, I would say this beer just edges it out on account of its fuller body. A sensational beer, which goes to show what a fantastic brewery 3floyds is. Id love to sit back and go to town on a bunch of these f*ckers all day. Which is why its a bummer that merely procuring them is an ordeal.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

Being in Chicago, I am able to keep a small supply , and I regularly give people their first taste-- I have yet to have anyone say its anything less than incredibly tasty.  

Doesnt matter if theyre into hoppy beers or not, which is how I see it as well-- I dont view this as a particularly ""hoppy"" beer, although it does use some unique hop flavors as centerpiece.

My favorite thing about it, and many others have said the same thing, is the carbonation.  Absolutely amazing tiny, champagney bubbles that are still somehow as delicate as some of the flavors.

Awesome, awesome beer.","","BeerSquare"

In retrospect I had to bump this baby up because it was a better pale ale than Alpha King, which I had again a couple of days after having Zombie Dust,  Alpha King still being worth the 4.1 I gave it when I originally rated it. Using logical deduction, you can easily figure out that this beer is worth at least 4.1, and not the 4.0 that I originally rated it.

302,"2012-05-02",4.2,"12oz bottle, no date but is supposed to be very fresh.  Served at around 40F.  Big thanks to Ryan for this one!

Pours lightly hazy orange/amber with a two finger off-white head that leaves a lot of clingy lacing and holds a small cap.

Aroma is citrus, grapefruit, tangerine, a lot of pineapple and tropical fruits, some apricot, pine and floral notes, a bit of biscuity malt underneath all the hops as well.  Very good strength.

Flavor is incredibly hoppy, and not just for a Pale Ale, this hangs right there with many top-tier IPAs.  Grapefruit, pineapple, tropical fruits, melon, pine, grass, fairly dank and resinous.  Pretty much all hops but there is a bit of cracker-like malt there.  Minimal sweetness, very nice bitterness on the finish.  Minimal alcohol.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily, a little sticky, good carbonation.

Fat chance of getting in.  So we waited about 20 minutes to buy beer, Zombie Dust being the main attraction.  The pub was so crowded that only 2 people at a time could get in.  Many jokes in the line were along the Soup Nazi fame.  People were carted out cases of Zombie Dust!  I got my 6 pack, opened one that night, took another in my luggage back to Florida and enjoyed it on a lovely Saturday evening (the other 4 were downed by my parents).

302,"2012-03-15",4.0,"In short: A kick-ass, straightforward and semi-dry fruity pale ale.  Fantastically drinkable.
How: Bottle 12oz.  Consumed fresh a few days after receiving it from sarro, thanks a lot Kyle
The look: Partly cloudy golden-orange topped by a large white head with medium retention
In long: The inviting and bright nose is full of tropical fruits with citrusy and piney notes.  This beer is said to showcase Citra hops from the Yakima Valley, however this is not the type of nose Im used to get from a Citra hopped beer.  Taste has very crisp malt backbone, very crackery, solid in structure but also discreet in flavor leaving the spotlight on the hopping.  Grapefruity, tropical fruits, lemony, a bit piney.  Bitterness level is mild-medium and the finish is rather dry.  For once this highly rated APA is not an IPA in disguise, this is truly a pale ale, and this is one I would drink gallons of.  If youre looking for originality look elsewhere, this is a straightforward thirst pale ale and a pretty damn good one.  Very addictive beer named after the street name (Zombie Dust) of a cocaine base drug, I have a lot of experience with street drugs and my favorite shape is blue.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

302,"2012-03-10",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
An explosive citrusy, tropical hop bouquet envelops this brews light sugars for a linear, but highly engaging hop quencher. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the misty pale amber.
-The soft mouthfeel makes this brew feel light even though its 6%.
-Even the finish is dominantly citrusy. Some delicate resins appear here and there, but
-The malt sugars taste lke simple icing at times. Malts dont contribute much else in the way of flavor
-The hop profile is overtly citrusy that it might seriously displease those who dont like fruity Pale Ales.

302,"2012-03-05",4.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 6/21/2011.  Served on tap at Northdown in a pint glass.

The pint glass is full of a slightly hazy, full colored brew. Tangerine, gold, and orange colors all make their presence known. A smooth white cap glosses the top of the beer, preserving the aromatic qualities of the Citra hop.

Sweet pale malt and a full dose of citrus - sweet juicy pineapple, lots of grapefruit, and some mango hoppiness. Fairly simple, yet a wonderful nose. Slightly pungent on the back end.

The light malt sweetness up front is pleasant and sets the stage for the hops to come through. Juicy pineapple, grapefruit, and mango emerge from the huge burst of tropical and citrus flavors. The great flavor makes me hardly notice the bitterness. The finish is fairly clean, with some residual bitterness.

This has a very balanced mouthfeel - light enough to be dangerously drinkable, but with enough body to give the hops a platform to operate. Smooth, creamy, and medium carbonated.

Citra is simply a fantastic hop, and there is not a brewery out there I trust to make a great hoppy beer with a fantastic mouthfeel. Right now I feel very fortunate that I am able to drink this on tap.


From notes.  Reviewed 11/8/2011 on cask.  Gravity pour out of a fresh cask at Fountainhead in a pint glass.

Zombie Dust arrives in a pint glass with a beautiful cask pour; a lightly hazy, mostly clear golden tangerine color with a rocky off-white rocky froth casually resting on top, an obvious reminder of the serving type. 

The aroma is a little bit muted compared to the bottle or tap versions, but it is still full of hoppy goodness. The pale malts give a soft sweet and bready back, with aromatic mango, pineapple, and grapefruit hops shining through.

Somehow, the flavor is even better than the regular tap version. Softly sweet bread and light grains cannot contain a sweet, juicy hop explosion that builds, peaks, and finishes without a single wasted IBU. The mango, pineapple, and papaya flavors work well with the sweetness, with a flash of tart and bitter grapefruit kick near the end. The most amazing thing is just how smooth this flavor is.

The carbonation is obviously on the very light side, there is just enough to excite the taste buds. A hop bitterness leaves a bit of hop residue behind my lips, and the overall sensation is creamy and smooth.

As a hophead, I love any version of this beer. It is even better on cask, and I am slowly realizing I might be a cask IPA fanatic.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Aroma is wonderful and full of citra hops followed by caramel malt and faint biscuit. Smells like a tropical buffett.

The taste is full of pineapple, grapefruit, lemon peel and a hint of caramel. Full of citra flavor but balanced nicely with sweetness. Very tastey, I could drink this all day.

Right off the bat you know this is not your normal Pale Ale.  A unique and big smell for the style.  Citra says hello here.  Citrus smacks the nostril.  Other tropical fruits come in next with some floral notes and a biscuit malt backbone.  Let this one warm up a bit, then just sit there and take it in.  Its not super hoppy.  Its not super malty.  Its just right.

This beer pulls off a bit of a magic trick when it comes to the taste.  Up front is bitter citrus.  Then it melds into the tropical fruit and honey taste, then once again it does another trick and ends with a caramel and biscuit malt.  Its unique to any Pale Ale Ive had.

302,"2012-01-15",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 29, 2012 Pours a cloudy golden orange with off white head and nice lacing.  Aroma is of resin and grapefruit hops with a bit of the caramel malt backbone.  Taste and smell are mighty powerful for 6%.  Big grapefruit hops that are intense enough but nicely held back by the sweetness of the malts.  Superbly crafted brew and something I could take back 6 without thinking.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"
302,"2012-01-07",4.2,"Big thanks to hellbilly for sharing. It pours gold with white head. The pulsing aroma is big and yummy with chewy sticky malt infused pineapple, grapefruit and orange juice. Smell just terrific. The taste doesnt reach the boldness attained in the nose. It is nice with grapefruit and pineapple notes sweetened by malts and then running into spicy hoppiness midway and into the finish. Nice citrus to spicy hopped brew where the hops are bridge by a modest level of sweet malts.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
302,"2011-12-31",4.0,"Bottle at home, on New Years Eve 2011/12. Massive thanks to phalesu, who rushed this one to me, so it was fresh! Pours cloudy orange, thin white head; lacing is spotty to good. Surprisingly small head, for a bottle that nearly gushed when opened, expected a thicker head. Regardless... Nose is spicy pine, with mandarin orange, tropical fruit, and nice grapefruit coming through underneath. Maybe not as over-the-top with the hops as I was expecting, considering the reputation of both the brewery, and the beer, but then this is my first hoppy 3Floyds brew, so Im in new territory here. Flavours are DOMINATINGLY mandarin orange. This tastes just like eating a freaking mandarin orange. Its truly bizarre. The remainder of the palate, beyond the mandarin notes, is spicy, piney, and balanced, with nice bitterness that in no way keeps this beer from being sessionable.

302,"2011-12-04",4.6,"I received a 12oz bottle in a trade with a friend in Chicago (thanks, Rob!).

Appearance: Hazy apricot-skin orange hue. Forms a large, soapy, white head which retains and laces very well.

Smell: Pure tropical fruit juice: orange, passion fruit, guava, pineapple. Extremely appetizing and inviting.

Taste: Its a beer like Zombie Dust that reminds me why I love hoppy beers so much. This is a palate full of delicious flavor combinations of juicy sweetness and hop bitterness. It begins with a lightly sharp, slightly dry hop bitterness. Then the palate opens up its juicy core and unleashes a cornucopia of tropical fruit and citrus. Not as tart and acidic as many West Coast IPAs, but does have the same amount of authentic juice flavors. Yet its not sticky, sappy, or syrupy either. From what I understand its a single-hop brew using the Citra variety and if thats the case I think the hop definitely lives up to its name. Absolutely delectable palate with the bitterness to match but nothing absurd. 

Mouthfeel: Medium in weight, but full in flavor - theres not a moment where youre not tasting something. Lightly dry bitterness in the aftertaste, but extremely tolerable.

Drinkability: Since I cant get Zombie Dust easily I had to restrain myself from guzzling it down. It has the perfect combination of a tasty, refreshing palate with a comfortable mouthfeel and smooth finish to match. At 6.2% ABV it would seem to be more accurately classified as a single IPA rather than just a pale ale, but thats for the beer nerds to sort out. This is a perfect companion for a spicy meal, but works wonderfully as a dessert beer too (you could make a sorbet out of this).","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Whoa, this thing packs a serious punch in the nose with grapefruit, pine resin, lemongrass, pineapple.  Some light biscuity malts as well.  Without a doubt, the best nose Ive come across in a pale ale.

Taste doesnt quite match the standard set by the nose but its still great.  The initial taste is juicy citrus with grapefruit and floral pine and grass - really showcases the Citra hops.  There is a light bready malt in the background but the taste is all about the hops which leave a tangy bitterness in the finish.

The mouthfeel is light, well carbonated and really crisp and clean.

302,"2011-12-01",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 2, 2011 355mL thanks to vw73182. Bottle release from the XV anniversary party. About two weeks old. Pours a clear amber orange with a towering, massive, rocky, off-white head. Sheen appearance with ridiculously insane, webby lace. Big sheets of complete lacing. Nose is huge orange juice, ultra dank mango, pineapple, mild sweet onion, pineapple flavored alcohol. My girlfriend thinks it smells like caramelized onions with meat...not necessarily bad. It certainly is not just a citrus/floral hop aroma. I would place the nose more at something like tamarind or other meaty Asian fruit we are not as familiar with. As it warms it gains more starchy character and sweet potatoes. In general, the nose starts off explosive and mellow out so no reason I see to let this decant like most beers. Taste has a nice biscuity quality to stave off astringency. Huge orange juice, ultra quenching malt character, with mild pineapple like alcohol and meaty fruits like jackfruit and durian. Very soft biscuity, quenching mouthfeel with decent amounts of butterscotch richness I get from Sculpin, Duet, and Alesmith IPA. Hot damn this is good. Ive now had about three bottles of this over the past few days and the palate gets super quenching, small orange juice acidity, citrus fruitiness. Whoa. Like APA category demolition right here. Forget about topping this ever. Well, maybe fresh Spring Peeper. Perhaps a little boozy for the style but who cares. Would be dangerous as a session beer.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Lively carbonation followed by tropical citrus flavor and a hint of grain, finishing with an aggressive bitterness.  It feels just a BIT one dimensional; I think it could benefit from a touch more maltiness to balance the bitterness and give the finish a little more depth.  Overall though, a great showcase for Citra hops; its easy to overdo it with Citra and end up with a beer that tastes like gummy bears.

302,"2011-11-14",4.6,"On tap at Prime Bar on Wacker in Chicago....several times.  Excellent.  Citrusy hops, so its one of my favorites.  It makes me think of a toned-down Arctic Panzer Wolf (another one of my favorites).  If its available near you, go get some NOW.","Illinois, USA","edwardbass"
302,"2011-11-13",4.5,"Bottle, generously supplied in trade by my man pantanap! To be honest, I had never heard of this one from FFF until I opened up Kans box a few weeks ago. I guess it shows Im not into the beer game as I was back in 07. Gotta get my geek back. The beer: well holy shit this might be the best pale ale Ive ever graced my taste buds with. Fantastic citrusy aroma with herbal pepper, lemon and grapefruit character. The flavor, while straightforward and uncompromising, is a blissful experience of the Citra. Super clean on each sip, I dont think a beer could be more crisp than this. Imagine a honeycrisp apple infused with grapefruit and lemon juice with tons o hops. Not to mention the kickass label to boot. Kan, I need cases of this. Name your price.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"
302,"2011-11-09",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 16, 2013 Recent review: 17FEB12, 3/4.5/4/3.5/4 (4)
Okay, Im gonna give this another fair and balanced review:
Bottled: recently Im assured
Pours a golden ale with a finger of off white soapy foam that falls to a broken sheet of the same leaving some spotty lace. I am reserved about smelling....Alas, the smell I remember, lemony, citrusy zest and a hint of peach. So nice. Flavor follows suit with just a hint of alcoholic sharpness. Finish is sweet and juicy. Medium on thin with moderate carb and a watering finish. Much better this time around. Gotta say, this beer MUST BE FRESH, so far as I can tell.

Original Review: 11NOV11: 3/1.5/1/2/1 (1.3)
Ive had this beer out of a growler, and it was one of the best APAs Id ever had. Too bad the transition here was flawed....heavily. 
Bottled: unk 
Pours a yellow straw with foam which falls rather quickly to a mirror of the same. Smells like: citra, grapefruit, citrus, more citrus?...NOT AT ALL!!! This smells like band aids and onions. Wow, god awful. Then the flavor is brutalized as well. Bitter, astringent, nasty. Body is fine beyond my clinching jaw. This beer is ruined for me. WTF happened to this bottle?!

The aroma picked up fresh orange zest, black pepper, and a hint of rye over honeyed malts and soft, sweeter breads.. balance was spot-on, and I really dug it.  The flavor opened with tangy orange zest, floral notes, and some black pepper.. semi-sweet middle with honey and bread again.. finished spicy, bitter, and refreshing, showcasing a lot of tasty citrus.  Medium-bodied with higher, prickly carbonation on the palate.. rolled well through the mouth.. great brew, and it certainly did the Citra justice.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

302,"2011-11-05",4.4,"Bottle 33 cl shared with friends (28.09.11). Pale amber colo... ...uh, well... fuck a shitty normal rating, man, Zombie Dust deserve something different. This is probably the freshest beer ever had. It stunned me with a MASSIVE aroma of basil, sage, *living grass* like smell uhm... a creature like the Treebeard from Lord of the Rings, maybe. Moreover, its really piny, like a pine needle decoction. Citrus too. After such an extreme aroma you could reasonably expect an extreme body; on the other hand, beer is totally balanced among malt and hops over a medium body, drinkable just as a top-class session one, and leads to a fabulously bitter finish harsh full of resin, leaves, citrus, grass, herbs, ecc., ecc., that lasts almost forever. No way, try this one and you want more and more. I could imagine a scene like this: a 24-crate of Zombie Dust in a fridge box nearby me, comfortably relaxed on an armchair reading Salinger or Foster Wallace, while Pink Floyds notes spread over the air, and sounds me like a little fragment of heaven despite Im atheist. APA? IPA? Uh... does really matter? Seriously: Zombie Dust goes to the top in my personal best session beers chart, just below the Pliny the Elder... or, maybe, goes even draw with.

302,"2011-09-26",4.2,"12 oz bottle.  Generous extra from dougofthefuture.  Thanks Doug.  Pours a cloudy golden amber with a small white head that has good retention and leaves a small amount of lacing on the glass.  The aroma is wonderful.  Huge mango, light pineapple, light grapefruit, and some light honey.  This is definitely a Citra hopped beer.  The initial taste is some sweet mango that goes into a light breadiness with a bit of pineapple.  The finish has some biscuit, more mango as well as a light bitterness.  Light, slick mouthfeel and a relatively low carbonation.  Great beer.  I would love to be able to drink this regularly.","Berkeley, California, USA","jethrodium"

302,"2011-09-25",4.1,"Quite the gift from Lendi! Smelled like a Christmas tree, full of dry pine scents and dried citrus fruits.

A big thanks goes to Lendi, whom some friends and I met at CCBs BA Hunahpu release, that had and shared a bottle of this with us. Cheers!! Smelled like sweet citrus and pine with a ""clean"" summer breeze smell. Hard to describe, but awesome. Poured a nice golden/light orange color with white colored head. Taste was fantastic with slight pine and citrus notes from the hops and a refreshing light herbal/grassy note. Reminded me of Headwaters Pale Ale but + some. Sooo refreshing and crisp. Could sip on one of these all day and not want anything else.","Florida, USA","OmegaX"
302,"2011-09-24",3.9,"On tap at a trendy local establishment where some dudes were getting tanked before one of them was getting married (classy).

Hype or no hype, this is a pretty nice beer and worth a shot if you can find it. Not sure if anyone outside of Chicago will be seeing 6-packs in stores, and Im not gonna race all over hells half acre to score some, but I was impressed nonetheless.","North Central, Indiana, USA","574deadzone"

S: Bright grapefruit, orange, pineapple and just a tad bit of resinous pine. Assertive tropical fruit blast -- reminiscent of fresh Sculpin.

T: Like biting into a fresh grapefruit -- with almost none of the bitterness. Amazing tropical fruit component that shines in a fresh, vibrant way, but not super-bitter like most IPAs/dIPAs that pack this much flavor per sip.

M: Smooth, medium bodied, with assertive carbonation (but not over-carbonated). Refreshing, clean finish.

The body has a good amount of carbonation even though this came from a growler shipped from several states away. Medium bodied, average duration on the aftertaste with a nice touch of bitterness.

302,"2011-09-16",3.6,"Interesting beer, though the first impression I had of it was rusty well water. This one takes a few swallows to grow on you. Pours a nice golden yellow with a fairly thick head of white, creamy froth. Citrus and pine notes in the aroma and flavor. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, almost watery. Not quite so full-bodied as some pale ales Ive tried. I like it, but Ive tasted better (and Three Floyds makes better).","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"
302,"2011-09-13",3.7,"Bottle graciously given to me by pantanap...thanks Kan! - Pours pale amber with a quickly dissipating off-white head. Smell is...damn...an eclectic mix of hops, dominated by mango, garlic, onion, melon, and a bit of citrus. Not much malt presence to speak of. The taste is pretty onion-and-garlic forward, with some light mildew, tropical fruit, and some light, sweet malt. A bit grassy/piney in the finish. Taste is obscured a bit by the biting carbonation, and its got a little heavier body than the APAs Im used to. Pretty good, but the taste doesnt match up to the smell.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
302,"2011-09-12",3.5,"Sampled at an ESBLS tasting.  Big citrus hops are smelled.  Those are also dominant in the flavor.  This is kind of like one of Mikkellers single hop series.  Good but one dimensional.  Again, good.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
302,"2011-09-11",3.9,"Draft samples at DLD 11.  Pours a hazy dark golden color with a large white head.  The aroma is big tropical fruits and citrus that filled the area around the picnic table even on a windy day.  The flavor had more nice citrus and tropical fruits, caramel malts and a decent amount of bitterness to the finish.  This is as flavorful as many IPAs that you can find.  I cant wait to get my hands on a couple bottles to see how well they compare.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
302,"2011-09-09",3.8,"Big thanks to enelson for this. Poured into a pint glass.

4.0 A: Moderately hazed golden color. One and a half fingers of pillowy white head. Retention is about average and a good sized, full ring of lacing is left behind.

4.5 S: This APA has the hop aroma of a DIPA. Strong mango, followed by pineapple and orange. Grapefruit and pine after that. Sugary cake icing. No hints of any malt. Pretty clean overall.

4.0 T: The taste isnt as crazy citrusy as the nose. Still theres a good bit of pineapple, mango, and orange. More pine and grapefruit than the nose suggests and not even close to as sugary. Moderate bitterness. A bit of malt this time in the way of breadiness and a light yeastiness. A little less clean than the nose.

4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation, especially for a growler. Reasonably creamy and smooth overall.

4.0 D: This is a pretty good beer. It reminds me a lot of Selins Grove IPA that I just had a few days ago, but a less intense version of that. Still, I would have no problem drinking this to get a citrusy hop fix.

302,"2011-08-18",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2011 Big thanks to Deuane for picking me up a growler of this one during his recent trip through the brewpub.

A - Pours slightly hazed golden orange with a nice one finger tall white head leaving 

S - HUGE amounts of grapefruit throughout this one. Tons of oily citra hops dominate the nose with a bit of lightly toasted sweet caramel malt hiding in the shadows. The second we cracked this growler I could smell it from across the room.

T - Starts off with a huge, oily, citric hop bite quickly giving way to a mix of strong tropical fruits like grapefruits, pineapple, and oranges. Once the hop resins die down you get a bit of the chewy, lightly toasted, caramel malt but this one really is all about the hops. The alcohol is nearly undetectable, only coming through at the very end of each glass. The finish is a mix of citric hop oils and some light chewiness, lingering for some time.

M - Medium-Light body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Lots of hop oils and some light chewiness in the feel, lingering through the finish. Even with all these hops it remains quite light.

O - Well that growler disappeared pretty damn quick. I could drink this one all day, every day, it is that good. The citra hops are the perfect choice for this beer and this is easily one of the best hop-forward pale ales I have ever had.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

Aroma: Dank bud, mango, apricot, tangerine.


Taste: Citrus out the wing wang. Punctuated bitterness, slightly sweet malt. Like most beautiful Citra beers Ive tried, your tongue is looking for bitterness that just isnt there, and it makes the beer fall off in the finish.


Mouthfeel: Thin with moderate carbonation. This would probably be remarkable on cask.


Overall:  Even though I thought it could be a bit more bitter, to balance out that amazing dose of citrus, I still finished it loving it.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

Pours a nice orange color with a two-finger head. Quite bubbly at first and eventually falls down into a light cap. Slight lacing on the edges of the glass. The nose is nice with a bit of citrus as well as the usual tropical suspects that come with a Citra brew.

The flavor really takes off on what was present in the nose. There is quite. Bit of tropical fruit, some orange, and then quite a bit of nice bitterness. Really nice how the flavor and bitterness interact here. Feel is bitter.and a bit light with really nice cabontion. Thrilled that this was still here and am very glad I got to try it.

302,"2010-12-12",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2012 Had the opportunity to share an imperial pint of this and Alpha King with my wife, setting up a side by side tasting.  It is an orange-copper ale with a fluffy white head that recedes, but remains atop for the duration.  Grapefruit, mango, apricot, and tangerine aromas fill my nostrils.  The first sip fulfills the promise of the aroma, with a slight bitterness backed by light malt base.  This tastes like what I imagine a combination of Gumballhead and Dreadnaught may, minus much malt or wheat flavor.  The only let down is the mouth feel, as it is a bit thin; however, that makes it dangerously drinkable.  While the malt backbone is not that of Alpha King, the hop profile makes it just as tasty.  I expect to see this at number 2 on the APA list.  FFFs answer to those that think Alpha King is unfairly categorized as an APA.

Tempting. Initial is lighter end of medium bodied, big tart peach, citrusy grapefruit and lemons, touches of tangerine, floral bitterness, some grass, lingering fruity melange coupled with pale malts, bread, biscuits, and grainy malts. This brew really is all about displaying this hop varietal though. Lively citrus and peach, lingering bitterness, florals, a tasty brew.
