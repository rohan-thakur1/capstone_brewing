4345,"2008-09-06",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2008 Growler.  Pint shows a clear golden color with a decent head and clingy lace.  The aroma is quite pub bitter like, English hops and malt, and some marmalade.  The flavor is rather bready and floral, with decent hops to temper.  The palate is fairly cleansing and filling.  Overall, I like it fine - glad I got the take out growler.  Update 9/20/2008 - Had this cask and it rocks!  The flavors really show through and make for a nice English pub like fully rounded pint.  Wonderful!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"
4345,"2008-08-08",3.2,"On tap. A dark slightly hazy golden. Golden promise malt. Smells like a scotch ale, light aroma. Nice flavor.","Minnesota, USA","grimreeser"
4345,"2007-07-08",3.5,"Golden, cloudy chill haze. heather and honey come to mind. rich malt and alcohol. Town Hall always does better with their seasonal and single releases then some of their standard house brews. This early spring brew is a pleasure.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","malzmiller"
4345,"2007-04-01",3.7,"Golden orange and mostly clear.  Mossy aroma.  Hints of hay and sourdough  very English bitter.  Taken as an experience its like breathing through the mouth off the shore of a temperate zone coastline.  Rotted wood, seaweed, and wet mammal and salt mist.  The scotch malt works its magic.  With hints of doughy flavor, white fruits and grassy hops.  Palate is rather empty and sour.  Lacking a bit in depth but extremely interesting.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
4345,"2007-03-29",3.1,"Didnt get much from the nose on this one.  Cloudy gold color with minimal white head.  Faint nose.  Grainy sweet tasting body with a little hop bite to it.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
4345,"2007-03-22",3.6,"At least this was available during my last trip to Town Hall.  I was hoping to try the Wheat Wine and this beer.  Lets see if it is as good as it sounds.  Somewhat fruity boquet.  Pour is a hazy orange.  Some bitterness on the finish, so I can see there were some hops, a good sign.  Grainy on the palate; not super smooth, but yet, still very interesting.  Sweet but not overly so.  Pretty decent brew here.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
4345,"2007-03-16",3.7,"tap at brewery.  This is just a nice simple fun easy drinking session beer.  This is one of those fun to drink beers that make you thankful for a great brewery like this.  This is beer.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","undsioux7"
4345,"2007-02-16",4.1,"Cask!  The bartender pulled a cloudy hazy frothy cascading golden orange brew and set it in fron of me. I put it side by side with a regular tap version of the same beer. The cask version was considerably deeper (the tap version more towards the golden side of the equation). It was a lot cloudier than the tap version which was clear. Faint aroma of a musky malt. 

Taste - ahhh. Fantastic maltiness, a bit sweet, surprisingly complex. I tasted a bit of mustiness, but in a good way. Ive had Town Halls ""Musty Pete"" and didnt care for it. But this one I liked because the mustiness and peat flavor was subtle. Some honey. Lots of melon. Melon? Howd that get in there?

Perfect carbonation. Perfect white head that lasted forever. Medium body. Exceptionally smooth mouthfeel. Simply put, this beer is great.

I tried this beer on tap last year, and again from the tap this year. Good, but not outstanding. But on cask, oh my goodness!","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"
4345,"2006-05-01",3.6,"On tap at the brewpub in downtown Minneapolis. Nice orangish pour with a creamy white head. Vanilla like aroma, sweet, bit not cloying.Good subtle bitterness with some sweet candied sugar notes, some apricots and hints of butterscotch. Thickish, creamy mouthfeel. Good session starter.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
4345,"2005-06-22",3.7,"Light caramel color.  Sweet as a Maibock.  Roasted malt.  Deep, rich flavor.  Excellent finish.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","BCAR"
4345,"2005-02-25",3.4,"Pints on tap and cask.  Light orange color with a thin head on tap, thicker and creamier on cask.  Aroma was slightly fruity and grainy.  The grains on the tap pour were overwhelming.  It wasnt to the ""dusty silo"" level, but definitely more than is necessary.  The cask was much smoother and more rounded in the flavors.  The dusty grains blended back into the body and let the barley come out to play.  Just enough hops to say hello.  Okay, but not what I was expecting.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
4345,"2005-02-24",3.1,"Orange/Brown Coloring with White Head.  Had on Tap and on Cask.  Malt Aroma and on the Tongue....Sadly a Disappointment.  Malt...Light Fruit Notes...but Overall a Grainy Taste That Cannot be Ignored.  Much Smoother on Cask and More Drinkable.  Decent Session Ale.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
4345,"2005-02-17",4.3,"Cask. Orange. Butterscotch bitter vanilla aroma.  Velvety head-no bubbles visible, just a cloud of frothy goodness.  Creamy x3 hearty mouthfel bringing honey and lavender through to the finish.  Well done indeed.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","ChrisPants"
4345,"2004-04-13",4.2,"I've never done a review ""from memory"", without help of notes, but there I was at the pub without my notebook and they have on cask the one beer of theirs that I haven't tried in the past year and then some. But consider that I left the pub just 30 minutes ago, and had 2 pints, I should be in the clear.
Appearance: hazy, straw-yellow color, leading into a dusky orange, with a solid, though thinnish, creamy head. Aroma was muted, somewhat dry, but still with sweet hints to it.
Taste: little hops here, but plenty of fruit flavor, though subtly played, I tasted apricots, and white grape, a bit of melon, and a whiff of figs, even. Malt is the key element, and though I know not which one or what type, it's character was singular, dry, yet a bit grainy, still a touch sweet and lightly fruity. The cask-conditioning provided an extra smoothness in the drinking, and in fact, that's all I thought while tossing in back, ""smoo-oo-ooth!""
Body is lightish to medium, and the finish is dry, yet long, lingering, flavorful.
Somehow I totally missed this one last year, but I'm glad that I got a chance again, and I veered from my usual quirk of not having the same beer twice in a row, if I can help it, that has dogged my behavior like a superstition for many years...it was just too good!
Another very satisfying Town Hall brew, do not pass this one up if the oppurtunity arrives!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
4345,"2004-04-11",2.7,"rating from what i remember from a week ago...  this beer left a sub-par impression.  it uses the same malts as macallan's, so i was pretty excited to try it-- because that's one of my favorite scotches. anyhow.  this stuff is way too sweet. syrupy palate.  slightly dry finish. i couldn't stomach this.","st paul, Minnesota, USA","ztrvz"
4345,"2004-04-10",2.2,"Some fruit aroma and also hopps.  Light gold color, looks like a cider.  Flavor is of sweet malt, a taste common in town hall beers.  Really too sweet without anything backing it up, like a fruit flavor; rather, just sugar. Thin.  I'm glad they gave me a sample.  I didn't really like it.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
4345,"2004-03-16",4.3,"Surprised to walk in last night and find this long lost love on cask. Made my night. Nose is melon and maybe pear drunk on fine whiskey (single malt?). Great aroma! Taste is less fruit more caramel-laced bitter. Texture is unusual, almost greasy, but not unpleasant. Alcohol is, indeed, hidden well. I could have killed the pint. Grab this ""mistakenly tapped"" brew at Town Hall while it lasts.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","BitterPoet"
4345,"2003-07-08",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2005 Scraped my first review cuz it was unjustified compared to this offering - Wow! From the tap - fresh growler 2/24/05: Same color, a peachy yellow thats very clear with a bigger, steadfast, firmly foamy whitish head and thin ink blobby lacing stick all over the glass. 

Aroma has a very pleasant fresh crispy sweetness of wheat dough and grains that you can tell is gonna stick to your palate with love as you sip. Lightly transendant caramel biscuit notes frolic underneath.

Flavors just dont quit with this one, lovely sweet malt bringing a nice light toasty caramel and wheat dough mix within a lightly leafy hop backing and a ton of favorable sticky tones making a home right on your palate. Very malty, and not darkly so, more wheaty/grainy and toasty bringing to mind the Maibock style it nearly mirrors.

Feel is quite chewy, sticky, and full; lushiously smooth with a full malt load of under currents that builds with a bit of toasty factions then turns to a light husky wheat and leafy hop topped with a touch of melony sweetening way late. A true keeper! This shit rocks! Another Hoops wonderment of drinkability! I could drink it all day!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
4345,"2003-04-08",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2004 4/2/04: Re-Rate. I'll preface this re-rate by saying it followed a pint of Town Hall's new Big Ticket Double IPA, so it started off very poorly. It slowly improved as my palate recovered, but I still felt at the bottom of the glass that this year's version of the Single Malt is a downgrade. Appearnce improves to a 3 but Flavor, Palate and Overall drop to 6,3 and 13, respectively.
4/8/03:Sweet and moderately hoppy in the nose. Smells like a hoppy English Bitter. Small, white head with virtually no lacing and mostly diminishing. Light amber body; almost a deep gold. Moderately bitter flavor. Very well balanced between hops and malt. Somewhat sweet. Single Malt is a very tasty brew that I would have drunk all night were it not for so many other good Town Hall offerings.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
