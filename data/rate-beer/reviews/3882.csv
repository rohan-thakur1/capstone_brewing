3882,"2016-07-15",3.8,"16oz can. 6/22/16 can date. Appearance: Reddish, amber brown with a slight haze and a moderate khaki colored head. 
Aroma: Toasty, light caramel maltiness, with a moderate resinous and light citrus hop aroma. 
Taste: Rich toast, bread crust and caramel maltiness dominates the taste profile. Strong hop character throughout to balance the rich maltiness, leading with resin and finishing with a moderately strong perceived bitterness and a quick burst of grapefruit. 
Mouthfeel: Fairly heavy body for the style, with a medium carbonation. 
Finish: Hop bitterness really lingers on this one, almost stronger than during the actual tasting. Sticky resin really lingers on the tongue. 
Overall: Really interesting in that this beer seems to be a blend of an American IPA, Red IPA, and and English Bitter. Malt profile reminiscent of English pale ales, but the hop profile is probably suited for a IIPA. One thing is for sure, theres nothing weak about this beer. Its very good, but the intensity would make it tough to power through multiple in one sitting.","","TH28"

The pour is a deep amber color with a thin cap of off white head that falls down pretty quick to a film leaving some solid lace. The aroma is incredibly malty. There is a sweet caramel thing happening. All of the hops are done and gone, that's for sure. The malt is strong. The flavor is again very malty. There is a little bitterness that I'm not too crazy about. It's definitely past its prime. The mouth feel is heavy, and the carbonation is a little softer. This one is an interesting glass of liquid. The aftertaste has a little bitterness with it, but for the most part it's just an absolute malt bomb that got lost in the year old debacle. Ugh.

Quite outstanding nose of orange, orange rind, tropical notes (mango, pineapple), subtle pine and even more subtle spicy spruce. Underneath is a rich biscuit base that is bready with soft caramel hints.

Light medium body that is quite smooth and has creamy aspects. Normal carbonation levels with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a stronger finish.

The flavor profile is outstanding with a laid back bitterness and intensity, fairly complex and well balanced. Hops arrive in a blended fashion and never really separate, although orange is noticeable from the middle on. The middle has a moderate bitterness that is rind and pine based. A solid malt sweetness balances from the middle on, which allows the orange to shine. The finish is dry and a rind bitterness lingers.

Large amount of pine/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, lemon/orange peel, citrus rind, pine, caramel, brown sugar, toasted bread, and floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; with a good malt/bitterness balance and minimal hop astringency after the finish. Good amount of dryness from bitterness as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and slightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome IPA. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of bright citrus/tropical/piney hops and moderate dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink.

3882,"2015-07-31",4.1,"Pours a hazy orange-amber color, with a decent head.

Smells of juicy oranges among biscuity malts, topped off by a note of crisp lime. Malts are very prominent on the nose, evoking a sweeter appearance of the beer, balancing the fruity hops easily. 

Has a medium carbonation, as well as a medium body, while producing enough hop bite to remain pleasantly refreshing.

Tastes of bready, slightly earthen malts, with white orange zest mingling into the beers malt backbone. Oranges grow stronger on the palate, due to the mineralic carbonation and lime juice, introducing a challenging hop bitterness to the tongue. The beers balance remains enjoyable throughout though, as the malts provide enough power to withstand the dry turning, slightly grassy hop onslaught, while staying on the bready side. Its sweetness gets provided by utmost juicy orange and blood orange, teaming up beautifully with lime juice. Finishes with a sweeter, fruity impression, completely focussed on the tropical hops, which create a long lasting dryness. 

Fantastic, intensely hopped beer, which remains easy drinkable. Very fruity and refreshing, while the malts not only settle the balance but also add to the flavors in a very efficient way.","GERMANY","aleigator"

The nose has huge notes of resin, tropical fruit, pine and grapefruit, along with medium toasted malts and hints of toffee and bread. The flavour is Intensely bitter throughout, with a huge resinous happiness that builds towards a long, bitter finish. Notes of citrus peel, tropical fruit and lightly toasted malts come through nicely as well. On the palate, it is medium in body with a smooth, milky texture and soft carbonation.

3882,"2014-06-23",3.1,"Reviewed from notes.
This was poured once in a pint glass and once in a tulip. There wasnt any difference.
The appearance was always a nice golden orange to amber color with a one and a half fingered white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute. The lacing slid into the beer.
The smell had a nice sweet maltiness running underneath of a nice citrusy/piney hoppiness.
The taste was basically the same that lead to a decent sweet aftertaste and a dry sweet finish.
On the palate, this one sat at/about a light to medium in body and holds a decent sessionable aspect about it. The carbonation was slightly smooth as it didnt really seem to hold its own as far as sharpness for a normal AIPA.
Overall, good AIPA for the most part, but this seems to be just a tad too smooth as I didnt get the normal pummeling on my tongue from an AIPA. If anything, this is still worthy and maybe I hope to try this fresher some day.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Aroma- Aroma is of sticky tropical fruit. It reminds me of a melon salad with waves of caramel sweetness that cut through.


Taste-Piney hops hit up front. The beer turns a bit jucier, with tropical fruit flavors. There is a lingering bitterness from the hop hit and there are some caramel flavors as well. Mostly bitter hops though.


Palate-The beer is fairly balanced, albeit hop forward. As expected, the finish is very dry.

The smell is amazing. Equal amounts of citrus and pine hops along with a little bit of caramel sweetness.

Hard to give it elite ratings though with all the recent IPAs Ive had comparably.

3882,"2013-06-30",3.7,"16 oz can into a pint glass.

A: Pours a cloudy dark copper color. The head is quite good; a one finger off-yellow shade thats very creamy looking. It retains acceptably, but not amazingly. Still, it does leave nice specks of lacing on the glass.

S: At first whiff, it seems like an IPA heavy in both caramel and pine (which arent always my bag), but this seems to have something else to set it apart from the pack. Maybe its the fact that grapefruit notes are fairly distinct here, or maybe its the fact that this has some nice fruit esters to them. All I know is that I really like the aroma.

T: The first thing I notice is a bit of caramel and toffee, right up until the hops take over. The hop profile is more piny/floral than grapefruity. I swear the finish is almost like grape jelly in a way. This is probably the calling card of this brew - the fruit esters, when they pop up, are fantastic. And after a while, I even note some peanut butter flavors on the back end...thats right, folks, this beer kind of tastes like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. This is a solid, complex, yet unexceptional IPA otherwise; but damn. I cant tell if the PB&J flavors are an awesome feature or Im going insane.

M: A bit thick in body, with the carbonation giving it a bit more coarseness than I would like. Once that calms down, it becomes *very* soft for an IPA. Good drinkability, but it could also be drier.

O: Ill take any chance I can get to try this beer, so naturally I had to take a shot on a can that wasnt spectacularly fresh. At first, it struck me as just another IPA; after a while, its depth (and unusual yet pleasing notes) really start to impress me.

3882,"2013-03-04",4.4,"Surly is intoxicatiing, literally and figuratively. One has a hard time figuring out how they accomplish so much in this brew. The nose is fantastic the hops take over on first blush. You want to nose this IPA over and over but each long whiff makes you want to taste it more and more. All the aromas that will reach your nose become manifest upon tasting. What an amazing HOP BOMB. This is not for the faint of heart. Strong ruby red grapefruit spring to the forefront then the piney resins pop. Further still there is a swirl of sweet grasses and juicy stone fruits. Amazing! The hops attack the front of the tongue upon the first sip with sparkling bitterness. The wonderful red grapefruit then washes over the back of the tongue. The carbonation is aggressive but spot on as it delivers the full hop experience. There is little head retention and light lacing in the shaker glass I juat had .yet the carbonation still delivered as the beer warmed. Fresh on tap takes this fine sold canned IPA to an incredible level. The carmel malt holds this all together and provides the structure to this hop explosion. As the brew lingers on the tongue there are more and more flavors to be discovered, including tangerine and even a hint of musty barnyard. Surly Furious is challenging and complex and well worth the visit. Here in Mpls. it runs about $11.00 a 4 pack of 16 oz. cans.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","TheMaha"

But it's *balanced* by an incredibly rich malty flavor, which is hard to come by in a 100 IBU beer. I believe the deep amber color foreshadows this. I typically find beers have to be at 7.5+% to exhibit great flavor, yet Furious does it at 6%. Now I'm really looking forward to Abrasive, which is in the fridge ...

3882,"2012-12-10",4.3,"Can. Poured a deep amber with a two-finger off-white head. Classic IPA aroma with the hops and some citrus coming through. Taste was a little different than expected from the aroma, though. The malt comes through a lot more on the palate and its sweetness takes away some of the hop punch but in a great way because the hops still really come through, just with a different balance than a lot of other IPAs. Fantastic.","","matthewgerke"
3882,"2012-12-07",4.4,"16 ounce can, canned on 11/21/12.  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours a dark amber color with about an inch off-white head that stays around for a long time.  Theres a decent amount of lacing.  Aroma is good, the brew smells like pine and citrusy (grapefruit) hops, along with some bready and caramel malt.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but theres also the addition of some floral hops and a bit of tropical fruit.  Theres also a nice lingering hoppy finish.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its slick and smooth with moderate carbonation.  I have to say this is a pretty good brew, its rated high for a reason.

A: Pours a dark ruby with golden hues around the edges due to the light. A one finger, off-white head form on the pour and subsides into a nice bubble film. Little splotchy sheets of lace around the glass.

S: Im pikcing up some piney hops on the nose with a little woody backnote. Quite interesting. Grassy and fruity notes on the end.

T: Bitter hops up front with an oaky/woody taste during the middle. The malt bill is also very present with some light cracker and gives it a slight grainy and grassy taste. The bitterness lingers throughout the taste and lasts even after the swallow. As the beer warms some of the citrus starts to pop gives the tongue a nice deviant course to follow.

M: Medium to light bodied with coating bitterness that lingers forever. Great carbonation that lasts and lasts.

Oily texture, medium body, medium carbonation and a long, moderately bitter finish.

3882,"2012-05-01",4.4,"Originally reviewed: 4/14/09. Poured into my pint glass. Pours a very deep dark amber with a huge off-white frothy head on top. Its 10 minutes later and theres still about a quarter inch resting on top. Decent sticky splattering on the glass edge. Huge scent profile of piney and citrusy hops. Very floral and sweet smelling. Very inviting this one is. 

Mouthfeel is crisp and clean. Carbonation level is spot on. Flavor is bitter right of the bat with a huge hop profile. As I go along though this gives way to a sweet malty presence full of caramel flavor. Drinkability is extremely high on this one. Probably the best representation of an IPA Ive had to date.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

1 Pint of beer in a can. Bottom of the can reveals that this was canned on 02/14/12. I tip my hat to Surly for supplying us with freshness indicator.

Pours a reddish-brown color (quite dark for an Ipa). The cream colored head stood an impressive two fingers tall following the pour. When you hold it to the light, its a beautiful red color. Plenty of lacing on the glass.

The aroma has hints of pine, grapefruit, and caramel malts, but its on the mellow side for the style.

Taste features a nice balance of hops and malt up front. Theres definitely some earthy flavors that follow, which I almost expected after I saw how dark this was. I hate to say it (and I know that some will disagree), but Im getting a sort of metallic taste that Ive experience while drinking other canned beers. The hop bitterness lingers a bit on the back end making for a nice finish.

Medium bodied mouthfeel with moderate....approaching high carbonation.

A nice Ipa, but for me, it didnt live up to the hype overall.

Moreys Bottom Line: Ive been waiting to try this for quite some time, and Im a bit disappointed. Its still a good beer, and I would definitely drink it again, but I wouldnt go out of my way.  Im generally a bigger fan of citrus forward IPAs. This is more in the vein of Titan or Ballast Point Big Eye.","Erie, Pennsylvania, USA","Morey"

Furious pours a full amber cherry color, slightly hazy with a huge fluffy off-white sea foam head. Nice retention, and lace sticks all over the glass on the way down.

Boom! Tons of caramel malt, grapefruit, and piney hops... just when I crack the can open. When I get down in it, the hops have some herbal character, but the pine is still the most dominant. 

Furious just knocks my socks off - this is what I want an IPA to be. Sweet buttery toffee and caramel up front. Spicey pine provides an intro to the hop profile. Juicy grapefruit and pineapple, then more pine. Some sweetness comes back at the end to finish relatively clean. 

Great huge hops create a tingling sensation on the tongue. The right level of carbonation gives it a creamy feel, almost buttery. The hops make it juicy. The only thing that really detracts from the feel is that a little hop oil remains on the tongue and some stickiness stays on the lips after each sip.

This beer makes an appearance in my fridge at least once a week. I chose to review a can that has about four weeks on it because thats realistically about the average batch youll find at most metro liquor stores on any given day.

Poured from 16oz can to Surly pint:

Pours a still, hazy amber gold with a swelling frothy head - off-white, pushing a very light brown. Precise lacing.

Smell and taste:

There is an obvious malt backbone of caramel and dark syrup that supports a splendid hop profile. Pine tree notes are most obvious but there is a clear citrus presence as well. The beer finishes with a dry orange peel bitterness. Youll find a more dominant hop bite from a super fresh can but this one certainly does the job.

3882,"2011-11-16",4.0,"I poured a 16oz can into a tulip glass.

Appearance: One of the darkest IPAs Ive ever seen: pure ruby gem color with massive haze. Forms a small, foamy head which retains and laces fairly well.

Smell: Like a pine forest with tropical fruits growing on the trees. Distinct resin aroma with underlying fruit juice concentrate.

Taste: I did an experiment while tasting Surly Furious for the first time. I had two cans: one was only 11 days old, the other was four months old. I noticed the older can was more in line with a typical West Coast style IPA of grapefruit citrusy bitterness and candy sweetness. The fresh can was more East Coast with rich piney resin bitterness. Its really interesting how just a few months, even in a can, will affect the flavor of the hops.

It begins with a sharp dry bitterness which gives way to malty sweetness. The fresh can is slightly toasty with syrup-like taste for a moment. The older can was like orange juice with distinct tartness and an almost sugary cereal-like sweetness. Both palates end with a sharp hop bite and lingering aftertaste. The fresh can was resiny and cloyingly sweet; the older can was dry acidity. Both palates were very tasty with plenty of qualities I enjoy in a good IPA. I felt that there was a noticeable mildness, almost as if the palate is trying to restrain itself. The can indicates its 99 IBUs, but it doesnt seem quite the high to me. Still, a very satisfying and unique IPA.

Mouthfeel: Slightly thin and tepid (under carbonated?). Hops definitely linger and dry out the tongue.

Drinkability: The well balanced palate combined with the thin mouthfeel make Surly Furious extremely drinkable. Its refreshing while in the mouth, but the hops and sweetness can be a little cloying in the aftertaste. Still, it goes down extremely smooth and lends itself to big gulps rather than sips. A great beer to pair with a meal, but it works perfectly as a beer own its own.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Finishes very long and bitter, and more bitter. This was one of the beers that taught me to enjoy beer, and I am easily reminded of why.","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"

A: Rusty orange with a finger of tan foam which falls quickly to a partial sheet of the same. Excellent clarity. Spotty lace. (4)
S: Resin, grapefruit, sage touches over a slightly sweet malt backbone accentuated with honey notes and the faintest copper fumes. Really nice nose here (4.5)
T: Earthy hops up front, a hint of catty dissonance between the sweeter malts and resiny oils. Doesnt taste as good as it smells, but it is a mighty fine beer. Getting some bubblegum later as it warms. (4)

3882,"2011-10-03",4.6,"Ported from BA.

Ive had Furious in just about every possible way, but this is based on my experiences having tank Furious at Darkness Day 2010.

Appearance:
Coppery and orange, a little bit hazier than from the can. Not much head to speak of, but kind of a thin white film sitting on top of the glass.

Smell: Citrusy and very slightly sweet, and an earthiness from the hops. Highly aromatic and well-defined. However its served, you can recognize the smell of a Furious.

Taste:
The citrus strikes again, with an amazing burst of slightly sweet malt. Not as sweet as the smell, but it doesnt need to be. The taste is extremely well balanced, as if this was surgically crafted. The hoppy finish is a beautiful end note.

Mouthfeel:
Fuller than from the can (which has more of a medium body), and nicely crisp. It leaves me feeling like Ive just eaten an apricot.

Drinkability:
Extremely high. The taste leaves you wanting more, and if youre in MN, theres always more to be had.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

 Can at home.  August 2011. Big thanks to Steve (fbm115) for sending this amazing beer.

Pours golden amber, glitteringly clear with a frothy eggshell-white head. When sinking my nose towards the glass Im about to go crazy, its that fantastic. The fresh aroma of hop cones is preserved and I get the most wonderful fragrances of pineapple, grapefruit, citruses, resin, pine and grass. Super clean and crisp. I also appreciate that theres no real sweetness to it, its very subtile. This makes it come together a lot better and showcases the hops in a superior way.


The big hop character is reappearing  in the taste and everything else rotates around that. The balance between sweetness and bitterness is spot on, neither is dominating. With such a rich hop aroma this is surprising, many other IPAs and IIPAs have a problem with being to sweet and sticky in the taste. Not Furious. The malt flavour is present in the taste and adds another facet to the beer. What more can I say, I wish the can was larger? When an IPA appear like a Double IPA in terms of taste and aroma you can be damn sure its good. Thanks again Steve for sending me the best IPA I had this summer.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","blafa"

Lots of different strong flavors that blended well together. Kind of like the Abrasive that I had earlier in the day, it was a good mixture of dark (chocolate, caramel, malty) and citrus (pine, grapefruit). 

The taste was similar to the smell, down to the mixes. The lacing stayed on my unshaven face, which I enjoyed. Slight bitterness, but all the blended flavors kind of outweigh it.

Average carbonation. So good throughout, just smooth and consistent.

A - Pours golden amber orange with a nice one finger tall white head leaving spotty lacing down the glass.

S - Smells of tropical fruits; like grapefruit and mango; pungent citric hops, and some light sweetness, possibly from the caramel malt.

T - Starts off with a big dose of bitter citric hops slowly giving way to a mix of tropical fruits; like mango, grapefruit, and orange peel; sweet caramel malt, and a touch of chewiness toward the very end. The finish is a mix of juicy fruit, hop bitterness, and a touch of dryness, lingering for a short period of time.

M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Bitter-Sweet feel with a good bit of it lingering through the finish. A tiny bit too sweet but overall it has very good balance.

Through the middle some strong bitterness and floral flavors come through. But of light fruit in the mix.

3882,"2011-02-21",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2014 Pours from the can into my American Pint glass with a reddish brown hue, darker than most IPAs, certainly it is in the Midwest school of color. The head is foamy and rises to the rim of the glass, it is slightly off-white and leaves bubbly lacing. 

Having brewed my own DIPA today using a pound of hops, I know the fresh hop scents and this brew is bursting with them. The nose is full of concentrated citrusy, spicy hop scent. There is some malt sweetness but only enough to be considered just enough. This is one of the hoppiest smelling brews I have come across.

The hops roll right onto your tastebuds with furious intensity, I dont know if it is because of the can or what but the hops in this one seem really fresh. The malt is there in the taste providing the backbone needed for a solid IPA. 

The Midwestern IPAs are some of the best out there, and this one is the best out of the bunch.

The aroma is mostly a combonation of citrusy hops and toasted caramel malts.  Perhaps an herbal tea note slips in there but its a pretty straight forward scent.  The flavor follows.  This has a sweet, and fairly substantial, caramel malty backbone that counters the citrusy hop bitterness.  I keep thinking pine too but its trumped by tropical fruit.   It drys out a bit in the finish with some good lingering bitterness.  Quite a bit of flavor for 6%.  If youre looking for a balanced IPA, without sacraficing flavor, look no further.

4.0 A: Clear orange amber color. Two fingers of frothy, yet dense head that retains exceptionally well. Super sticky and leaves tons of lacing.

4.5 S: Lots of citrusy and piney hops and lots of sweet malts too. Grapefruit and orange citrus with resiny pine. Though the hops run the show, the malts give strong aroma too. Lots of caramel sweetness.

4.0 T: Drier than I expected, yet still not super bitter. Hop flavor centers around resiny and piney hops with grapefruit in the background. Malts arent as complex as in the nose and lend a soft sweetness with a touch of toastiness. Still, this is very tasty.

3.5 M: Light body. Reasonably creamy and super smooth. I know a lot of people like a low FSG with their IPAs, but I like thicker, maltier bodies on mine.

4.0 D: Great aroma and taste, but mouthfeel could use some reinforcement. That said, Id never turn one of these down. A well crafted beer, but could be hoppier.

A mild hoppiness tends to linger on the palate. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
3882,"2010-08-21",4.1,"16oz can,  Pretty nice appearance, a deep orange-brown body with a large, foamy, beige head.  A really nice IPA, with a mellow enough malt body to really let the hop flavor shine.  Very hoppy finish, coats the mouth in a bitter stickiness.  Slight English feel to it, but the bigger ABV and mega-hop taste is all US.  Some pleasant dark malt tones in there as well.  Surprisingly soft and restrained despite the soapy, piny tones.  Well done.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
3882,"2010-08-17",3.5,"Picked up this pint sized can at Discount Liquors, in Milwaukee. This was $4.99 for one pint, so
this quite expensive, but I dont think Ill have the opportunity to try this again. This beer has a nice
brown color with a wispy head. This beer is dark for an IPA, but it looks great. The beer has a very pungent hop 
aroma. Smells very resinous. Has a lovely and fresh hop aroma. Not as bitter as thought it would be, but this
still has a wonderful flavor. Nice citrus hop at first, and then it gets into a deep pine flavor. This beer leaves
quite the bitterness on the tongue. As my brother noted while drinking this, its a bit on the thin side. Its not
watery, but it doesnt have the ""nicest"" texture, as some world class IPAs seem to have. Overall, this beer provides
a decent amount of bitterness, but it is lacking in some areas, such as texture to carry along those bitter 
qualities.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

3882,"2010-04-26",4.2,"Thanks to delriumfest for this one!

A- Body is a translucent dark amber/ ruby red hue. Pours with a nice 2 finger creamy white head which slowly subsides to 1/2 finger and has perfect retention from there. Leaves lots of lacing all the way down the glass. Body is uniform in color/conistency.

S-Caramel, toffee, and spicy hops come to the nose first and at the end is a big dose of citrus. Smell falls on the sweet/spicy end of the IPA spectrum.

T-The initial flavor is quite subdued, a hint of earthy hops comes through with an even smaller dose of pine mixed in. The finish is where this beer gets complex. Caramel malt sweetness comes though in a big way in an attempt to balance the assault of piny hops, citrus hop flavor, citrus hop resiny bitterness, and a spicy hop accent. What lingers is a medium to high residual hop bitterness and a hint of spicy hops.

P- Wow. Very well done. Medium tingly carbonation and a smooth oily body.

O- This reminds me of a good red ale rather than an IPA. The flavor is smooth and balanced and this is certainly not a hop bomb-though the hop bitterness is there. My first Surly brew, and I have been waiting to try Surly for quite a long time now. Well done overall and something I would trade for again

3882,"2010-03-17",4.3,"Aroma - A fruit cup. No really, not grapefruit, not piney resin, a fruit cup. Some caramel as well but a refreshing nose to draw you into the depths of this offering. 

Appearance - Poured into a pilsner glass from a 16oz metal can. Nice markings on the can to include ""99 IBUs"". Should be interesting. Popping the can doesnt release any noteworthy carbonation sounds. The pout produces a mild one finger head. The resolution is nice, with good lacing on the sides of the glass (left enough headroom on the pour). Color is a clear orange-amber with ample carbonation feeding the remaining head. 

Taste - First the hops, have to make mention of the obvious. Yes, they are present here in ample quantities, but the ""force"" behind them is well-balanced with a very present malty backbone. There is depth to this hop presence, more so than Ive tasted in many DIPAs which seem to be more focused on ""quantity"". Yes, this is an IPA, a very tasty IPA. The expected finishing hop bite was very blunted (which is very much welcomed to this malt lover). Enjoyable. 

Palate - The body is very dense for this offering. Lots to chew on here. There is a creaminess here that is outstanding. Nice ""layering"" on the tongue while at the same time a tongue-cleansing finish. 

Overall - Perhaps my can had some age on it, or Ive been trying to expand into DIPAs recently that I very much enjoyed this IPA. Top 10 IPA? Yes, well-ranked from my limited experience/perspective. I liked it better than Sculpin. I need more of this.","South Carolina, USA","Nesued"

Big hoppy aroma, nice and earthy, with notes of pine, caramel malts, and some light citrus notes.  A big hoppy flavor follows, a variety of hops held together by a nice caramel malt backbone, with notes of citrus and such a nice balance of bitter, sweet, and malty.  This isnt complex, and thats just fine.  Its a basic hops-malt-citrus (and light on the citrus) IPA, but its done so, so well.

3882,"2010-02-07",3.4,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2010 Pale orange color. Smallish head that leaves a good deal of lace. Nose is loaded w/ wonderful fruity hop goodness. Id guess amarillo is involved.

I liked this better as it warmed up.","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"
3882,"2010-01-23",3.5,"Aroma is quite bold on this one, dominated by hops, specifically citrus grapefruit and pine resin, along with some floral characteristics. Good looking beer with lots of lacing - certainly nice to look at. The taste is too overwhelmingly hoppy for my tastes. I think the Bells Hopslam does a better job of balancing the hops and the malt flavors -- from reading the description here Im struck by the general lack of malt strength. There was very little balance in this beer, and my mouth tasted bitter hops almost exclusively after the brew went down. Over-carbonated, too, which is too bad considering the Bender had such a nice feel in the mouth. Perhaps I had a lesser batch than what others have had. Dont get me wrong -- theres some serious potential here -- but the problems are quite obvious . . . perhaps its just too ""American"" for my tastes. Too bold without enough true substance or true complexity, in my opinion.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","joechristenson"

3882,"2010-01-11",4.3,"A: Pours a nice deep red color with a huge frothy foamy head. The head is a true warrior and hangs around for quite a long time. As I slammed down drink after drink it left behind sheets, and I do mean SHEETS of lacing.

S: I can tell before even taking a drink this is a very aggressive brew. The aromas are big and bold. Its hop madness times 3. Hops dominate here with citrus playing a big roll. I detect tons of ruby red grapefruit along with the acidity of lemon zest. The malt is present though and comes thru in undertones of caramel and coffee. 

T: Wow the flavors abound. Immediately you are assaulted by bitter citric hops which assault your tongue and throat. My mouth and tongue is thoroughly coated by this gem of a beer. Deep pine resin reminiscent of pine tar comes on strong. A mild sweetness then overtakes you. I would describe the sweetness as a marriage between nutty toffee, and browned butter. It really smoothes this one out a bit. As the brew hits the bottom of my throat all taste subsides except for a nice hop bitterness that seems to last and last.

M: This is a full bodied brew that is nice and thick.","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"

Hops. Big pine hops. Lush tropical/citrus hops. Just overflowing with the floral bouquet of hops.
A very light hint of caramel malts.
Smells completely out of balance.

Im shocked. It tastes like hops.
This is such a harsh hops bitterness. I can tell that there are some caramel malt notes in there, but just when they come forward, the hops leapfrog right over them and attack your pallette.
This is way too far out of balance, for me.

The mouth is crisp and sharp with a slight touch of creaminess.

If you love hops, this is definitely one to search for. Like you didnt know that, already, though. If you havent had it, get it.

Recently, this beer reminded me how important the nose is for flavor, and how important it is to drink beer from its proper glass. A friend brought some Furious to a job-site for me because he knew that it was a favorite of mine. There were no glasses, so I drank from the can. That was about the same as chewing a branch on the Christmas tree. yuck!! This beer (and any good beer or food) is nothing without being able to properly let the nose do its part in developing the flavor. Huge hop nose, Huge hop flavor that is snatched back from the brink by some serious malt depth.

Aroma of pine, pine and pine; some citrus and Scottish malt.

Juxtaposition of pine bitterness and semi-sweet Scottish malts. It seems that there is a slight peat flavor, but maybe that is my imagination since I know about the Scottish malt. Bitter at end.

Relatively low carbonation for the style. Exceedingly smooth, similar to a DIPA. Very dry.

Immensely drinkable due to the flavor and smoothness, but the bitterness really builds on the taste buds. I love really bitter beer, but usually dont want too much at once.

Smells good too--floral and citrus hops, with perfume and caramel lingering. The flavor starts with hops, but flows into malty, bready flavors. Theres a bit of an oily hop taste on the finish that feels a bit off, but thats nitpicking. Its soft and creamy in the mouth--just delicious. I want to visit MN just to buy some more.

Cracked the can, and an abundance of hops jumped straight out at me.  About perfect temp at 56 degrees in my basement.  Nice full head with a great aroma.  Wonderful balance to it, the malt balances the hops, but they still make their way straight to the forefront of the flavor.  I was worried for a second after reading the can it would have to much malt like some IPAs tend to have.  Very drinkable at 6.2%, youll never know it.  Since the hops arent crazy high, you can drink without taking a breather from an insane amount like Two Hearted (which i love), but makes this a great beer in its own right.

Poured into a standard pint glass this beer produced a nice amber hue with a long lasting 1 finger head.  The aroma consisted of pine and citrus.  The taste almost mirrors the smell for me.

The flavor folloows with the orange and grapefruit hops up front and then quickly balanced out by the big caramel malt backbone. It is not as hoppy as I was expecting, but a great flavor. A very substantial body for an IPA, but is very smooth and easy to drink. Finishes sweet with some hop bitterness on the backend.

It has intense aromas of serious grapefruit, spice, citrus, and pine.  The flavors are unbelievablely balanced, even in this unbalanced IPA, showing a strong malty forefront which melds well with the intense hop backbone...just the perfect amount of malty sweetness presence.  The finish seems to last minutes on the palate, as the sting of your tongue gently fades...not to mention, its only 6% abv, which is a feat in itself to have so much complexity in such a small abv.","Crestwood, Illinois, USA","JLAudio"

Very oily hop resins, almost soap like but in the most appealing way.  Medium malt richness gives way to a matrix of hop flavors.  This beer oh so very hoppy but delicately balanced.

Pours a cloudy, deep brown-amber colored body with a finger-width, dense, frothy and creamy, beige head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing throughout. Aroma is big floral hops with a nice citrusy grapefruit and piney resin. A light sweet orange in there as well. The malts balance well with a toffee-bread and a light-medium sweet caramel. Flavor is similar. Lots of juicy, floral citruses up front before some grapefruit, oranges, and pines come in. Solid malt backing again with the slightly sweet toffee-bread and caramel. Orange comes out a bit more towards the end as the citruses grow a bit juicier and this finishes with lots of florals, resiny pines, and a sturdy malt backing leaving a medium-high, but balanced, dry bitterness. Lengthy aftertaste following a slightly creamy, medium body and a soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, a really nice IPA. Big, fresh, solid hop mix of citrusy florals and resiny pines balanced with a nice toffee-bread and caramel. Definitely a hop-heads IPA. Great stuff. (8,4,8,4,17=4.1). Original rating (7/19/2008): On tap. Aroma: Extremely hoppy. Tons of fruity and citrus notes. Slightly spicy with some apricot and malt. Appearance: Brown and cloudy amber with a small white head that remains pretty lacy. Flavor: Tons of citrus hops. Loads of really good malt and bitter fruit. Palate: Medium body with a very pleasant coating of the mouth. Pretty creamy. Overall: Very good beer. Extremely bitter and hoppy, but an awesome balance with the malt. Great lingering aftertaste.

Smell is of caramel, pine, citrus, grass, and toasted biscuits.
Taste is that of the aromas with a sweet, caramel covered biscuit flavor that has been toasted in a brick oven thats been fired by cut pine with some tangerine peels thrown into the flame. Along with aforementioned journey through the brick oven, the beer offers some doughy yeast, and a touch of pepper and spice.

3882,"2008-06-01",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 21, 2012 My Bottom Line:
The bursting, unfettered hoppy festivities of this India Pale Ale seduce the lupulus lover with minty, resinous, and grassy petals atop a slender caramel malt stem. One cannot help but be hypnotized by this luminosity.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam protects the misty amber copper.
-This could be a little too intense for non-hopheads, but for those looking for a hop fix, this as bright and fresh as it gets.
-This might not be balanced, but who cares.
-The mouthfeel is softly carbonated (feels natural), and the malts just big enough to provide sustenance while never taking drinkability away.

Creamy mouthfeel coats the mouth in hoppy goodness but still stings the tongue with bitterness. Medium body with solid carbonation.

4/3/08 Pint can.  Pours a cloudy amber with a big foamy 2 finger tan head with nice lacing. I had to check to see if Furious was indeed the IPA, as my can tastes more like a barleywine.

Clean, defined grapefruit is all over the place along with caramel, and delving deeper, a hint of almonds. There is a continuous blast of hops throughout, especially in the finish. This is just brutally sucking the moisture out of my mouth with a lingering sting. The malts are fair, actually sporting some juicy caramel and more of a far-off toastier quality which may have merely resulted from the bitter devastation of my palate.

Paired with Garlic Chicken.

Poured from a 16oz. can.

Aroma: Hops & malty aspect come to mind right away.

Appearance: Copper color with a thick head (3 fingers) & lots of carbonation.

Flavor: Wow, bitterness of hops hits you & also taste of pine & spices float around in there. What i like is that even though there is a powerful hop presence, its very well balanced with the different flavors in it.

Palate: Heavy on the palate but as it warms, the pine & citrus are more dominant. Very pleasant bitterness that lasts well after the sip.

Overall: I love hoppy beers & usually have no problem with them, but as i was finishing it, the bitterness was almost too much for me. A very good, well constructed beer with a powerful hop wallop. Flavors abound from all over & are very pleasant. I would like to revisit though as maybe i was tired or something because the hoppiness really got to me near the end.

This sports a full bodied and creamy palate that leaves your mouth a bit sticky and dry. While this is plenty complex and rich, it is still fully sessionable and goes down easy.

Deep, dirty copper body with a twinge of amber and a huge, lacing, gorgeous rocky beige head.  Taste is very dry and deeply bitter - but the kind of bready, redeeming bitterness that keeps me coming back for more, rather than the harsh, aggressive kind.  Medium body and, again, full of bread/pine-soaked dryness and a certain earthy, rooty quality.  Awesome.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
3882,"2008-02-08",2.9,"The second i smell or taste this beer i can tell its an IPA (i dont like IPAs). I like hops, but not like this, its just liquid hops. I know there are lots of beer enthusists who love this and can really appreciate the very bitter, dry, piney cleaning product, flowery hop overloaded taste, but not me. I just cant sit back and enjoy it like i want to with a beer. I still will give it good ratings, but not because of my personal tastes, rather i can appreciate what they wanted to do and they succeded. They made a total hop bomb in lquid form. Another critique i have is why only 6.2!, this intense taste could easily hide 10% or more. Will not try again.","Pawtucket, Rhode Island, USA","Cryotek"

A blend of sweet caramel malt and pine-filled hops washes over the tongue, leaving behind a pointed hop bitterness that isnt at all unpleasant. Less malty than the color would indicate, but still a nice balance here.

Tons of citrus and some light floral hops in the aroma, with some molasses hanging around in the background.  Taste- well this beer has a hefty malt backbone, but the taste is almost all citrus and floral hops, with notes of earth and wood- the malt does come through, and kind of muddles the hop character a bit.

The aroma of the beer was made up of very rich caramel, toffee, grapefruit, and citrus hop goodness.  The flavor consisted of smooth, creamy caramel and toffee notes, bitter grapefruit rind, and also some English malt notes.  The mouthfeel was medium to full-bodied and a bit resiny, almost DIPA-like.  A light amount of carbonation kept the palate alive.

Has all of the good citrus and piney hop flavors and plenty of bitterness, but somehow seems tolerable at 100 IBUs.

Initial flavor of rich caramel and toffee malts, along with some very subtle tobacco and peat. There is an aggressive herbal hopiness mid palate, countered by some subtle citrus. Finish is earthy with dominate wet tea bag bitterness. I think what many people are missing about this beer is that it is more of an English IPA, with some interesting tweaks.

3882,"2007-12-29",4.4,"Pours a deep ruby orange with a good 3 fingers of ivory head that dies slower than normal and laces nicely. This already looks like a knockout. The smell blows my mind. Yes it smacks you with intense hops but the variety is wonderfully noticable along with very intense citrus. Piney, fresh grass and a hint of malt. This is not your average IPA. The taste makes my lower lip quiver and brings a tear to my eye. So many intense hops, citrus, grapefruit, some awesome malty balance with a bitter finish of perfection. Feels crisp and medium in the mouth wih perfect carbonation and has the drinkibility of an ultimate session beer.

This one is a bit too astringent for me.   The alcohol shows its face more then Id like and the bitterness is a bit overwhelming.  It seems that due to the overwhelming amount of hops they had a good portion of malt to balance it out.  In the end, this one is a bit of a mess for me.

Recieved this long sought after brew from my Secret Santa Tayner, youre the best. Furious pours amber with a mild case of chill haze. Tiny streams of carbonation bubbles stream to the surface. A one finger light beige head appeared on the pour and although losing about half its height becomes ultra creamy and leaves thick drink lines.

Furious smells like what an IPA should smell like. Caramel maltiness is there but way in the background where it should be. The middle brings sweetened grapefruit for a flash before some bitter grapefruit and big pine break through and overtake everything else. Theres also a slight aspirin bitterness.

This is a high quality IPA. Again the caramel is there but is knocked back so quickly that you have to pay attention to catch it. That sweetened grapefruit comes along mid-palate just before the bitter pine and grapefruit pith destroy your palate. I love me a good ol fashioned hop whompin and Furious delivers.

Medium bodied with a lively carbonation that not tingles every tastebud but awakens them for the stomping theyre about to take. Leaves a solid lingiering bitterness after each sip.

The drinkability is so good Im already getting teary eyed that my one and only can is just about gone. I could sip this all night long. I just want another mouthful after mouthful of pine.

Furious is one of my new favorite IPAs and without question lives up to the praise it recieves. Guess Ill be making a trip up to Minnesota in the very near future. I just need to get my hands on the other Surly offerings.

Not at all expansive or bright with the flavors, this degenerates mostly into unbalanced bitterness.  In my notes, I wrote, ""I have a feeling Surly is everything thats wrong with over the top.""  In the burgeoning craft beer world, where brash in-your-face brands like Three Floyds and Stone are doing so well, there is the danger that new market entrants will confuse style with substance.

Bottle: Great aroma of pineapple and citrus hops with some faint caramel.  It pours a slightly hazy amber with a small off-white head that lasts a minute or so and leaves behind sporadic lacing.   The flavor starts with some light caramel that gets dominated quickly by citrusy hops and pineapple in the finish.  Grapefruit bitterness lingers in the aftertaste for quite some time.

3882,"2007-10-16",4.8,"I was a bit skeptical of this product as it comes in a can. But persistent urging from a buddy persuaded me to give it a try.  As I poured I found this ale to be a deep, cloudy-amber in color, with a nice thick soft looking beige foam that made up its medium head. This is an eye-catching brew. It has a mild hoppy floral aroma with fruity notes. Unlike the aroma, the excellent full favors of this IPA come storming in on the taste buds, a nice balance of bitterness and body. The mouth feel is creamy, supple, silky, and full. The finish is long and lingering leaving beautiful lacing behind.

Surly Furious
16 oz can

Recent brewing, enjoyed 07/07.

Poured a copper brown with a large rocky fully lasting head.

Smelt of strong pine, resin, spruce and the whole forest of strong hops, pineapple cake, grapefruit, some toasted grain.

Taste was upfront strong bitter piney hops with a moderate sweet toasty malt backbone followed by a harsh bitter resin hops and more of the hops backbone on a lingering resin hops finish.

Palate was medium bodied, oily, lively carbonated, and strongly astringent.

Overall, this is just awesome.  Hops galore with a nice malt backbone.  Perfect balance.  Perfect everything really.  Should almost be perfect, but I let my Steel Reserve drinking friend have a sip and he recoiled in disgust.  ""Too bitter, man! "", he said.  So thanks to ballplayin Jordan and his Steelies it doesnt get a perfect score. I suppose its a little harsh if youre not used to it.  True, its really harsh and bitter for an IPA.

Smell- holy grapefruit Santa!! One of the best smelly IPAs I had the pleasure of sticking my nose in. Taste is a freight train of hops. Oily grapefruit attacks the mouth. Beautiful.... I am a hop head, but there is more than just hops to this beer. The scottish malt used adds a real depth to this beer and really helps countact the hop attack. I cant beleive this beer is only 6%. It could pass for a dipa, except a slight lack of sweetness. One of the best IPAs Ive had and I cant wait to get back to Minneapolis to track more down.

The aroma is hop centered, with grapefruit notes, pine resin, oranges and dried flowers, its really all over the board as far asd the hop profile goes. Plenty of malt in the nose too, fresh caramel and toasted grains lurking underneath the sweetness. The flavor is nicely balanced but not really that interesting. Medium sweetness is tapered well by agressive but never overpowering hops that lend a steady and moderately high level of bitterness throughout the flavor. The finish is long and sweet,  bitter hops lingering and eventually changing sweet to extreme dryness, quite the velocity shift at the end. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sticky, creamy and boasts aggressive carbonation thats only noticeable upon first sip. This is very well balanced, a well executed recipe but its just too boring.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately to heavily bitter. Medium body, velvety/creamy texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. I can see why its well-liked; its nicely balanced for the style (very bitter but plenty of malt to back it up) and assertively hoppy in the nose but has malt character to keep it from being one-dimensional. Nice creamy mouthfeel too. A very good rendition, even if not the most appealing sort for me.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3882,"2007-07-17",3.7,"Draught, at MacKenzies, Minneapolis, June 2007. Amber colour. Rather murky. Not surprisingly, this is all about the hops. The aroma is very intense with big pine and resin, but also a very leafy, herbaceous, floral character. Perhaps a little less intense on the palate. Relatively smooth and drinks quite easily. Despite all the hops, its not an outrageous ""hops at all costs"" beer and comes over as nicely balanced..","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
3882,"2007-07-16",4.0,"Thanks to Badgerben for this one.  Dark amber  chestnut pour with more carbonation than I expected and a medium foamy head.  The aroma is big!  Lots of powerful malt, caramel, syrup and nougat.  Hops just help it along with pine and citrus.  A good malt body greats you along with your first blast of power hops.  Burnt malt, caramel grains (even a hint of chocolateor am I imagining) with big pine/spruce hops throughout with citrus peal well represented at the finish.  The bitterness is two fold in this one as it seems to be coming from both the hops and perhaps some tannic grain husks.  Some metallic hints as well.  Body is medium in general though the mouth feel is a bit more watery than the flavor initially leads you to believe it will be.  Good.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

3882,"2007-06-15",3.8,"Pours with a frothy, initially two-finger thick, tan colored head.  The beer is a brilliantly clear, dark amber color that shows amber-tinged copper color when held up to the light.  The aroma as the expected, zesty hoppiness characteristic of American hops.  Sweet citrus notes of lychee, bergamot, ruby-red grapefruit, and candied orange peel mix with a backdrop of pine and a light herbal character.  A light maltiness finishes off the aroma with a touch of toasted malt, and a solid crusty bread character.

The taste is somewhat sweet, but this is tempered immediately by an aggressive bitterness that goes from start to finish.  Lots of citrus character, though it is not as sweet as the aroma suggests; notes of orange zest, ruby-red-grapefruit and lychee are all noticeable.  The finish, while bitter, has an intermingling of pine, green herbs and a definite menthol edge.  Actually the finish at times is quite minty.  What a long, lingeringly bitter finish; this helps to really dry this beer out and makes you thirsty for another sip.  A nice malt character is noticeable at times too; toasted grain character, freshly crushed malt flavors as well as lightly browned biscuit flavors.  This has a nice body to it, that helps to carry the ample hops; a sort of medium fullness that does not hinder this beer from being quite drinkable.

This is a really balanced hop attack.  I like how well mixed the citrus, sharper herbal notes and lingering bitterness mix quite well.  This is definitely a hop dominated brew, in fact it is very hoppy, but the malt is still noticeable here, though it does play a supporting role.  This has certainly lived up to my expectations for a hoppy brew.  Another kick-ass beer from a can; I love it.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Light bodied, creamy carbonation.  The carbonation is a bit thin and un-natural; a bit more crispness would help liven the palate up some.  The malt body that greets the tongue has a great caramel sweetness though it doesnt get too sweet or sticky and fits the light body quite well.  A bit of spicy centennial-like tarocco orange squeezed over a teething biscuit; sounds weird, but I like it.

3882,"2007-05-21",3.1,"I split a couple of cans of this with Flyer and SurlySober, and I have to agree with the sentiment of Flyers review (below); this beer is agressively hopped, very bitter (99 IBUs according to the can), and quite dry.  However, there wasnt a lot else to its flavor (no citrus, pine, grass, flowers, etc - all the other stuff that IPAs taste like).  However, it was a very smooth 99 IBUs, if thats at all possible.  Mouthfeel is quite smooth up-front, and the bitterness comes in slowly as the beer sits in your mouth and slides down your throat.  I found this beer smooth but not quite to watery.  The most drinkable very bitter beer that Ive yet tried, although I agree that it would have benefited from the addition of some other flavor notes.

The first thing that I noted about this beer was its packaging.  The color and images of the can made me think that a lot of people must accidentally purchase this thinking it is some kind of energy drink; or perhaps a caffeinated drink like Sparks.  Appearance of the beer itself is a clear-but-not-brilliant copper with lots of white head.  Smell is highly hoppy.  Flavor is as I described above.  Mouthfeel is smooth and highly drinkable, almost to the point of being watery, but far enough from there to just be very drinkable.  Given all the great choices out there, I cant say Id be in a rush to drink more of this, but during my next can-only expedition (canoeing, swimming etc), it might come along; or at least it would if we could buy it here in Milwaukee.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

Nice aroma of ruby red grapefruit and pine, with a bit of maple syrup.  Some buttery notes sneak in as it warms.  Flavor is intense and hoppy with notes of bitter grapefruit and pine needles predominating, with a touch of toffee, leading to a long dry and bitter finish.  This started out great, but subtle flaws like a bit of butteriness crept in as it warmed, adding a mild tarnish to what otherwise would have been a pristine hop experience.  Body also felt a tad soft and creamy for the style.  Theres some great bitterness here coupled with good hop flavor, though in the future I will have to prevent it from warming too much.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"
3882,"2007-05-10",3.7,"16 oz can.  Peachy brown, not quite clear.  Brief white head.  Orange blossom and nectarine with piney caramel.  Taste is equally sharp and fresh.

3882,"2007-05-09",3.7,"Can courtesy of pantanap (thanks!).  Poured a dark amber with plenty of white head.  You could smell the hops from across the room.  Very piney with some citrus in there.  I enjoyed the caramel malt base which led into the piney, grapefruity hops.  Finish was all pine needles and lingered for a decent amount of time.  Mouthfeel was moderate, not too sticky.  Im not the biggest hops fan in the world, but I enjoyed this quite a bit.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"

Poured the unexpected yeast shot into my glass.  Toasted caramel flavor, rich and malty with a healthy dose of grapefruit that fades to a pine filled finish that hangs in my mouth.

3882,"2007-05-05",3.1,"Sampled from a can.  Maybe jut a bit of a murkiness so this beer, slightly muddle dark orange color.  Chewy caramel and sweaty, maybe-grassy hop nose, a bit of metallic and burnt hop scents as well.  This isn’t the type of IPA/DIPA I prefer, so I wasn’t too hot about this one... over time I came to really dislike the burnt orange hop flavors, began to taste like nails.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

Its a darker IPA with a dark thick reddish amber color.  Cannot see through it, some light translucence, some clarity.  Aroma really in the DIPA territory - lots of hops and ample caramel maltiness.  A citrus-y pine tree with ammonia type sweetness.  Taste is too hop-water, which I often dislike.  A bit thin on other flavors leading to an overly abrasive hop flavor that ends in a long too strong bitterness.  Moderate carbonation. 7/4/6/3/15Re-rate: Tea Bagged Furious version, sampled at Darkness day.  This was very different than the first batch of the cans that I tried (maybe I should revisit the cans as well).  Obviously, the aroma is much happier but without being aggressive either.  The cool thing is that the flavor lost that caramel maltiness  that made the beer too mucky and sweet.  It was also very dry at the back end and much better attenuated.

Rich blended aroma, medium dark roasted malt and citrus/acidic/funky hops - almost woody, almost like pineapple - damn thats good - in a can!  Very unusual taste sensation - initially dry toasted malt, a little biscuity, quite grainy up-front - then the acidic/bitter hops kick in - scorched grapefruit pith, a little cedar bark - complex, very long bitter finish and linger, but peat and roast notes make it quite out of the ordinary  - and no can metal at all.

3882,"2007-02-26",4.0,"A crisp fresh salt of pungent hop kicks my nostrils into gear. Wowzer. Cascade citrus orange peels meld with bright lemony hop resins and a nip of pine. A wonderful quaf of floral and citrus, with rising heat and a nip of malt caramels in the nose. Pours a crystal clear ruddy amber, with sunset fire fringe. Foamed with creamy tan sticky lacing, sheeting the glass and floating high. On the tongue a deft hand of hops, with articulate loblolly pine resins, burning red pine sap and a whole bouquet of floral orgasm. The hop flavors are right there, as if off the vine. So fresh and ripe. Scarcely does an IPA seem to hold onto the crisp resins and hop sugars as this beer does. Maintaining a biting alcohol-fueled hop frenzy in the middle, this is a bitter beer, but only in a good west coast cacophony. Lucious, wet and sappy. This is a damn fine IPA. The malt backbone kicks in with light caramels, sweet maple syrup and drying raisin bread. A top IPA for sure.

On the nose is notes of citrus meshed with peach, leading into resiny pine on the palate with a touch of honey. Its very drinkable, although I find myself wanting a bit more ""kick"" out of this, and by that I mean not a hop kick. I dont know if that means upping the alcohol percentage, but I found the finish to be a bit lacking. Moreover, the excessive carbonation gets in the way here too.

The aroma is very piney along with some earthiness (not a dirty british hops earthiness) and a touch of citrus. The aroma foretells the aggressive hopping. On the malt side, there is a little caramel and a bit of a nuttiness. The beer is bracingly bitter, there is a little malt sweetness, some honey, caramel, and clean maltiness, but this beer is bitter. It is very much an aggressive American IPA, much like its west coast brethren. The flavor is very piney and spicy with some softer apricot/peach? notes. The finish is lingering bitterness followed by an even longer lingering pine. Enjoyable, nice when you want a bruiser.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"
3882,"2007-02-03",4.3,"Pours a nice deep reddish amber, with a short, taciturn head of sudsy foam. Okay head retention, pretty good lacing. Citrus hops are very noticeable in the aroma - very IPA-like - with a mild malt presence well in the background.

If the aroma sounds unbalanced, rest assured that the flavor is exceptionally well balanced - lots of hops and lots of malt. Both of which are fresh and delicious. Hops are citrus all the way, with bitter orange and lime flavors. Well, okay, there is a touch of pine in there too. The malt is a caramel-toffee blend, sweet, robust, and delicious. A perfect combination. The body is just north of medium, and generous carbonation rounds out a fantastic brew. Twenty minutes after finishing a second pint, I could still conjure up citrus bitterness in the aftertaste.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"
3882,"2007-01-30",3.2,"Out of a can in Minneapolis, MN.  Best hoppy beer Ive enjoyed from MN.  More of a strong ale than an IPA - the color is too dark and the caramel with slight roastiness puts it into slightly out of IPA territory.  Im dubious of the 100IBU, tasted less than that to me.  A little more residual sweetness than I would like in a beer like this, but it is still very good.  Tasty and unique, with a good package.","Oakland, California, USA","nahthan"

Edit: After finishing the entire four-pack, I hereby declare myself an idiot for not appreciating the rich taste (along with the long, lingering aftertaste, which, admittedly, isnt quite as rich) which really would be better if it came out of a bottle.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","lweiberg"

3882,"2007-01-26",3.9,"Well, I got Bent (Bender) earlier, so now its time to get Furious...  

Surly Furious is a hazy, deep red copper color.  It has a thick and creamy gold-colored head with good retention and wavy lacing.  Grapefruit, apricot, and pine dominate the aroma with a hint of the deep malty base hiding in the background.  The rich, caramel maltiness is quickly washed over by the intense hop bitterness and flavors (pine, resin, grapefruit citrus, even a touch of banana/toffee?).  I think this beer actually smells better than it tastes.  Dont get me wrong, the flavor is still really good, but its a very slight let down based on the aroma and somewhat typical (not overly unique).  Furious is a full bodied beer and is smooth on the palate.  There seems to be a lot of visible carbonation, but the bubbles are really small.  The resulting mouthfeel is soft and creamy.  Overall this is another impressive beer from Surly.  It is nicely balanced and not overwhelming (well, maybe just a little for a regular IPA).  Actually, I was expecting a little more band since the can said it was almost 100 IBUs!  Aggressive, yet under control...

Lemon zinger is fairly prominent with a delicious puckering citrus at the swallow.  The sweet malt gives enough of a platform to make this a delicious quaffer - not overly sweet or alcoholic.  This is quite a pleasant hop bomb - and easy to quaff.  Thanks Jeff.","Rochester, New York, USA","JahNoth"
3882,"2006-12-09",3.7,"16 ounce can
This is probably the second best beer I have ever run across in can form.  It competes in every way with Dales Pale Ale (except that you get 16 ounces per can instead of 12).  I think I like this one a little better.  I look forward to the day that Surly escapes the confines of the Twin Cities to reach Wisconsin and beyond.  This should be the first thing they export.
Aroma / Appearance - An exploding head cascases out of the can into the glass.  Initially there is only an inch of liquid and several inches of head but it settles over the course of a few minutes to the opposite.  The body reminds me of rusty water.  As I drank it, layers of lacing clung to the sides like layers of sediment tracing the buildup of a cliff.  Hints of freshly mown grass, melon, grapefruit and wheat highlight a bright nose.
Flavor / Palate - Caramel and grapefruit precede a bitter explosion that washes across the tongue.  When it fades traces of semisweet bakers chocolate chips unfold into a nutty finish.  The last traces of the glass tasted a little like coffee grounds which was a bit odd.  On the whole, though, it was extremely enjoyable.  Im glad I have two more cans left.  I will definitely be picking up more up this next time I go up to the Minneapolis area.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3882,"2006-12-05",4.0,"On a recent trip to the twin cities, this was recommended at the local beer store when we asked for something good and something local. He didnt know much about it, but said hes had nothing but compliments. Reading the can, it was obvious that it was an IPA, so we gave it a shot. The can thing is a little strange - but not a bad way for a small brewery to save some money - its not like people are cellaring this stuff - its meant to be consumed on the spot.

Anyway. I was blown away. Much better than expected. A rich hoppiness, that I didnt really get at first. After reading the commercial description it makes sense - the malt makes a difference. It adds a complexity that is generally lacking from IPAs, which, can tend to the unbalanced. The result is a surprisingly balanced American IPA. Good job guys - and let me know if you start exporting this stuff across the river to Wisconsin.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","jglazer75"
3882,"2006-12-02",3.6,"16 oz can.  Surly certainly has figured out the can gimmick, and they have taken it a step further by putting their beers in Tall Boys!   This is another great example of a fresh, well balanced IPA.  Certainly an up and coming Brewery.","Poway, California, USA","Naven"
3882,"2006-12-01",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2008 16 oz. can. Powerful hops aroma, but also a floral presence, like a hops-scented candle. Pours a clear, dark, red/copper with moderate amount of beige head. Perhaps the darkest pale ale Ive ever seen. Looks like a long-aged bourbon in the glass. Fruity hop bitterness in the flavor. The hops are quite strong, but, surprisingly, so is the malt. Very sweet for an IPA. The sweetness is welcome at first, but further sips made me wish that Surly had toned it down a little. Good, strong, bitter aftertaste. Smooth, soft texture. This is a very interesting beer. I love IPAs, but there are so many available that a lot of them tend to be forgettable. This beer, with its dark color, unique aroma, and supercharged hops and malt flavor, breaks from the standard IPA mold. I very much appreciate Furious individuality, but I do think that its taste is too sweet to let it rate as a truly top notch IPA.

<P>Re-rate 12-16-06: I tried this beer again last night, and I realize that, originally, I was holding it to the standard of an IPA. Really, this is a unique beer that is a crossover between an IPA and a Scottish ale, and it deserves to be judged independently. Consequently, I am raising the flavor score from a 7 to an 8, and, in celebration of its originality, I am raising the overall score from a 15 to a 17. Thus, the total score rises from a 3.8 to a 4.1. This is an unforgettable and very good beer, and such a beer deserves a score in the 4s. 7/5/8/4/17:4.1.

<P>Update 2-18-07: Surly Furious was included in a tasting of ten American IPAs that I attended last night. It finished in first place on my list, beating out Two Hearted, Avery IPA, Boulder Beer Mojo, and Victory Hop Devil among others. Frankly, the score probably deserves another boost to a 4.2 or a 4.3, but, as I did not do a formal rating of this beer last night, I will hold off on that.

<P>Re-rate 4-21-07: I tried my last Surly can from my original November purchase. Surprisingly, this IPA has actually improved from several months of aging. The texture is stunningly smooth, making the beer a pleasure to drink. The challenge is in not chugging it. The flavors are superb, as I have described before. This beer literally gets better every time I try it, and hence its rating keeps moving up. 7/5/9/5/18:4.4.

<P>Update 4-6-08: I tried Surly Tea-Bagged Furious for the first time at the Gitchee Gumee Brewfest in Superior, WI on 4-5-08. I am giving my review and rating for it here, but I am not changing my ""official"" rating for Furious. I had a small (approximately 3 oz.) sample poured from a cask. It was the sixth of 12 beers that I rated (out of about 20 total that I tried) at the festival. Pours a hazy, amber / light to medium brown. Large amount of fluffy, cream-colored head (rare for a cask beer in my experience). Great hops aroma that is very appetizing. Citrus and pine scents. This smells better than the standard Furious. Very malty-sweet with a good hops presence in the taste. Bitter aftertaste. Medium to full body. Soft in the palate. Undercarbonated and not as flavorful as it should be due to the cask. 8/4/8/2/15:3.7","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Beautiful grapey hops nose, truly superbly aromatic, if a tad unidimensional. Exotic fruit as lychee, dry green sultanas, and caramelised puff pastry. Dry, wry taste totally dominated by hopoils and α-acids. Hopdryness is such that a dry-out effect is realised on the lingual lowerfront. Theres some caramel malts underneath, but not enough.

Want hops...try this beer.  Its very hoppy and very good.  Its bitter, its piney, its not well balanced, but thats the idea.  If you dont like hops, you wont probably like this beer.  Fortunately for me, I like hops, and therefore like this beer.  I would say though that the variety of hops used is not at the very top of my list.

Sugary smooth grapefruit channels up the nose and cherry amaretto toffee takes center stage.  All in all, this nose is a glorious, sugary starfruit assortment.  Bitter flavor abatement christens sweet honeydew and amarillo bliss.  Buttered rum with grenadine.  Furious indeed.  Cherry grahams from sweet cobbler, spiked with bitterness beyond belief.  Sharp and synoptically sweet, drumming out some sharp alpha acids at the edges.  Hints of superlative caramelized scotch traits gives a desirable spicy background.

Very grassy with some grapefruit and cirtus. The body is right in the middle, not thick and sticky, and could never be confused with being thin. The taste is big! Hops dominate the flavour with a big upfront slap of slightly bitter and hugely citrus hops. Its like hop juice was poured into this to get this amount of hops. The amazing thing is that this balances out with a great malty aftertaste. The hop flavours remina, but that balance is essential and tames the hops down a bit. Its amazing that they are able to acheive this balance. 9/4/7/3/16-3.9 Copper colouring with a foamy tall head. Aroma is mostly floral hops, maybe some citrus in there as well.

3882,"2006-05-11",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2007 Holy hopness! Ya, like everyone says, its a hoppy mess, but tasty once you get past the puckering you do after a sip. Enjoyed more then a few 4oz. shots of this at Arborfest, where Furious won best brew, which i voted for by the way. Nice color, great taste, not for everyone for sure, but thats why its called furious and not Miller. One of my top five brews of all time.

UPDATE! Just bought this last week at the liquor store! It is of course now in cans, glorious CANS! It was just as great out of a can, they want you to pour it into a glass, which i did for the first few, but then i got lazy and just shot gunned them strait from the aluminum, and was not disappointed! ALSO i have upped my rating to the PERFECT 5...i have tried a ton of IPAs in the last couple months, and none of them are as great as ol Surly","Woodbury, Minnesota, USA","incutrav"
3882,"2006-04-23",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 17, 2007 enjoyed this one at barley johns.  felt kind of guilty since this was more memorable than their brews.  wow is this one ever furious with hops!","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","MoreHead"
3882,"2006-03-31",3.5,"Tap at Acadia.  Copper Coloring with Foamy Head.  Big Hops on the Nose..Citrusy and Lightly Piney... On the Tongue it was more of the same, bitter and very dry hopped right off the Bat.  Huge Hop Flavor with Very Light Malty Grain in the Background.  Shes More then Furious!  She the Answer to Hop Lovers Fantasies.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
3882,"2006-03-22",4.1,"Draught at Bryant Lake Bowl. Nice, sweet hoppy aroma. Inviting and promising. Rich, murky reddish dark amber with a small, off-white head. Excellent lace. Piney, hoppy and somewhat creamy with some sourness and somewhat acidic. Quite strong. Palate is a little rough. Mellows a bit by mid-glass. A great start for a new brewery. Very solid. Nice job.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
3882,"2006-03-06",4.0,"On-tap at the Happy Gnome: Cloudy rust with dark honey highlights. Smooth, firm topping of lighly stained brown foam. Out of two pints I had, one was slim, one was a finger high. Tons of layered lacing score the glass with heavy sheeted rings.

Aroma is all red grapefruit, quite juicy, zesty, and fresh. Although my first was barely traceable as the second had the red grapefruit standing out very prevalently.

Taste did not differ however; big red grapefruit juicyness with a sliding edge of dry leafyness takes hold immediately with the citric bitterness. Its quite nice at first, lots of hoppy grapefruit bitterness with only a slight malt keeping it tendered in a floury bread and very dry grain. However, the bite and dryness did take the realm a little too quickly and parchingly to fully enjoy the second pint as its a palate wrecker for sure. For whatever it is (amber/IPA) I wouldve liked a bit more balance out of it. I might as well have peeled myself a grapefruit and not used any sugar. Nothing complex about it besides its layer of drying bitterness.

The feel is all bitter, all squeezing, all parching, and all sour grapefruit juicyness. Actually quite heavy and full on the tongue and palate. A nice pay lode of hoppy bitterness. A bit too much though, even for this hophead.

I enjoyed this at first pint. Very nice grapefruit taste and bite. But it is a bit much after a while. It tired my palate out right quick and half way through the second pint my mouth was screaming for something else so I had a Porter instead of a third Furious. I see now why it is named as so. The hops are just that. Furious.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
3882,"2006-03-02",4.6,"On tap at Acadia.  
One sip, and I cant imagine life before this beer...its as if the hop-gods have at last deemed us worthy.
Hazy red-orange amber, thin lingering white head.  Spicy, fruity, herbal, and citrusy hop aroma.  Flavor is very hoppy, backed with a slight malty sweetness.  Relatively substantial body, with a crisp finish.  
This beer was clearly a labor of love...it would have been easy to just hop it all to hell and call it a day.  Its definitely hopped to hell, dont get me wrong, but careful attention has been paid to the malts as well.  This artistry has yielded a beer that is both well-rounded and over-the-top.  
A truly solid first offering from my new favorite brewery.","Hopkins, Minnesota, USA","Indy"
3882,"2006-02-26",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2007 Many, many samples at Winterfest 06 and tap at Cafe 28. Spicy and sweet hops with orange rind and lemon zest. Backed by substantial sweet red malt. For such high hops this is very drinkable and the finish is just dry enough to make it end clean. This is a major sight for sore eyes around town. When I first arrived I was excited to see Summit EPA everywhere. Lets hope the EPA paves the way for Surly and Furious to take up residence around town. I get excited just knowing  that I could get this in a 5 gallon keg!
Re-Rate May 07: Enjoying from a tall boy can. Ive never had a bottled or canned beer with hops as bright as this. Usually you see this on tap. Man its just fresh and sweet and alive","Mt Kisco, New York, USA","Brewso"
3882,"2006-02-25",3.5,"Tap at Acadia Cafe.  Dark red/copper color with a medium head.  Strong piney hop aroma.  More piles of pine for the taste with some more citrusy notes on the finish.  A little grain in the background which makes a nice, albeit small, counterbalance to the hops.  A little overboard on the hops for me, but a good IPA (an amber this can not be).","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
3882,"2006-02-15",3.5,"Tap, Acadia Cafe.  Medium amber, light haze.  Huge hop melange aroma, though clearly prominently featuring amarillo.  Loads of citrus and exotic fruits, rather intense.  Lean and mean.  Malt character was somewhere between medium and ""thinnish""  and probably closer to the latter.  Bitterness was solid and not overpowering, but the hop flavor, which was a tiny bit clamorous, completely overshadowed by the hop juice character of this one.  Perhaps Im not worthy, but I wanted to feel just a bit more heft and balance to my hopmonsters.   But I am very excited to see someone new on the MN scene and eagerly await more releases from them.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
3882,"2006-02-05",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 28, 2006 
On tap at Arcadia Cafe...it looked a dusky, dunnish hue when they server poured it, when I sat at my table, it glowed bright orange...held out of sunlight, a truer dark amber-ish tone. Quarter inch head, creamy, and long-lasting. Very fine appearance.
Up to the nose: fresh, vibrant hops, zesty citrus, glimmers of pine, a grapefruit and pineapple tango, but banana aches to cut in...lovely stuff, and ample for any hopheads appreciation. (4 hops, Amarillo for sure...)
Enters the mouth with ferocity and freewheeling force, spill bitterness all over the mouth, every crack and crevice is filling and rejoices from the deliciousness...creeps everywhere in the palate, and each area of contact finds its reward. A citric fruit explosion, but well met with an ample, biscuity malt base (Golden Promise is in there)...its a fertile malty field, and the hops are madly at play above!
Next comes the overload, the frequent pucker, the lip-smacking, the bitterness, and tasty hop flavor clinging tenaciously to the lips and tongue...zippy, zingy, mouth-grabbingly delicious at every sip and gulp.
A beer for hopheads to keep reaching for and for Minnesotans to be proud of!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
