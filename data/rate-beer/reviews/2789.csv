2789,"2017-03-14",3.3,"Grabbed a half growler from Milk & Hops to enjoy on snow day. Chestnut colored. Nose is light earth herbs and some dark fruits. Tastes of earth, tobacco, light plum, bready. Semi sweet finish.","New York, USA","Jow"
2789,"2017-03-10",3.1,"Milk and Hops, NYC tap: pours a dirty brown with a small head. Aroma is sugary malts and bread. Taste is bready and lightly sweet. No chocolate or anything like that. Not bad if just a little boring.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
2789,"2017-02-19",3.8,"Growler share.
My portion was poured into a pilsner glass.
The appearance was a mild semi-clear brown color with a subtle transparency about it. A fingers worth of white foamy head died off at slow pace. Mild messy lacing.
The aroma had some mildly sweet bready to smooth nuts up front. Lightly hopped with some sweet grassy tones.
The flavor mainly kept to the sweet breadiness. Hops seem barely there. Mild bready aftertaste. No finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Mild carbonation. Soft bready silkiness lays down on my tongue. ABV seemed a bit lower than suggested on here. 
Overall, to me, a nice beer that would be great with its respected food.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
2789,"2016-09-07",3.4,"On tap @ Zero Gravity. Dark amber colored beer with a finger of off-white foam. Has a decent amount of sweetness to it but also some herbal and floral hops. Was expecting a Dunkel/Tmavy, but it doesnt really have that chocolate or roast or coffee thing going on. Definitely a more toffee/toast/caramel sort of beer. Its kind of thin bodied, which I didnt really like about it, though I could see it being intentional. Anyway, its a pretty easy drinking, if not a touch sweet, beer.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2789,"2015-07-09",3.1,"On tap at American flatbread , brown in color with a thin white head, smell of brown sugar and sweet. Taste of sweet caramel malt and brown sugar, very light bitterness that dose not quit balance the mouth feel. Plate is a little thin.","","Inertiaman37"

2789,"2014-03-04",3.3,"UPDATED: JAN 13, 2015 My Bottom Line:
Herbal hops and caramelized cereals swim through this lean and drinkable Polotmavé (its not a Tmavé at all).

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the hazy dark amber(?!).
-The flavor profile is as clean as expected from this very good lager brewer.
-The mouthfeel could be fluffier to properly emulate Czech Polotmavés.
-This is not a Tmavé at all, its a Polotmavé. It has none of the roasted, earthy notes of a classic Tmavé, nor does it have that underlying dark fruitiness. How can anyone see a link between this and any Tmavý Leák brewed in Czechia?

On tap at American Flatbread Burlington.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
2789,"2014-02-05",1.7,"Draft. Pours burgundy with no head. Sour and sweet aroma that is off turning. Sour flavor with nice pepper flavors on the back that desperately attempt to rescue this brew. I'll pass.

2789,"2014-02-04",3.2,"tap on the premises. clear medium dark copper pour with a creamy off-white cap, good retention and nice lacing. roasted nuttiness, some partially fermented cereals leaving a lactose-like sugar, some fruitiness, coffee beans, light sulfur and dusty notes, mild hop character - slightly earthy and spicy. moderate carbonation, light body, relatively dry grassy-herbal-earthy-spicy finish. more than decent tmavé but nothing spectacular either.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
