It pours a classic crystal clear yellow with a thin medium head, the aroma is a strong banana wheat tornado and the taste follows close in line. It lives up to the rep as a filtered clear hefeweizen, but it doesnt lose too much flavor (as apparently is a problem with many others of this type). If you wanna try a Kristallweizen, get this one! Super weird that its evidently from the oldest brewery ever circa 1040?

I can clearly smell koriander and citrus fruits, like almost every weissbier. The beer has a nice fruity sweet aroma, which is accompanied by a nice zesty and koriander bitterness. The smell is nice but not very special. The taste of the beer is the same. It is a typical taste of weissbier. It has the same aspects as the smell. It has the nice citrusy and koriander in it. The balance between bitterness and sweeties is very nice. All in all, it is a good weissbier. However, I miss the nice cloudiness an unfiltered weissbier can have.

The aroma carries a strong Belgian yeast with it and a bit of clove. The typical flavors I'm not crazy about at all. There is a little pilsner ish thing going on, but it's not bad. The flavor is surprising. It's more smooth and drinkable than the smell would lead. It's very pilsner-ish and light. There is a maltiness that's happening and taking some of the negativity away from the Belgian aspects. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a lingeringly sweet malty finish. Much more drinkable than I thought at first. Not bad.

Its no use. Even more if weihenstephaner is THE perfect weizen, how it could be better without its trademark yeast? But reviews here were good so i thought was worth a try.
0.5 cl bottle at the braustuberl, it wasnt on tap. Golden color, obviously Kristall clear, big white head, and fizzy look. Smells like the classic weizen. Aroma is very similar to the regular one. Huge banana and bubblegum, very fruity. IT matched perfectly with a brieze bread, excellent combo. Taste is balanced, sweetish, with a delicate bitterness in the finish. Extra dry, light body.

Smells of a dough bread infused yeast character with a whiff of clove and cardamon to it, ballanced by grassy hops, together with lots of straw. Reveals ripe banana underneath, adding to the spiciness of the yeast, without loosing its white bread malt qualities. 

Has a very lively carbonation, with a soft mouthfeel, resulting in a very refreshing, light bodied beer pending between spices and malts.

Tastes almost as clean as the beer looks, while the initial yeast profile shines not only due to its pleasantly integrated spices, but also due to grassy hops and a certain amount of bready malts. The malts turn sweeter after the swallow, showcasing the beers flawless taste, enriching its yeast characteristics by additional balance and complexity, as well as a copper note, brought to the palate by the otherwise soft carbonation bubbles. Finishes with hay infused yeast, weaker on the spices than during the beginning, absorbed by profound, sweeter malts, pleasantly feathered by leafy hops.

Looks truly stunning. Aroma expectedly has a lot of sourish wheat, a bit sourdough-like, along with soap, white bread, fresh banana, cloves, vanilla ice cream, white grape peel, red apple. Taste is softly fruity, notably sweet, with a big presence of banana flavour (more than in any other Kristallweizen I had so far), spicy yeast notes, minerally carbonation sparkling on the tongue, deep and elegant wheat sourishness which, together with the strong carbo, dries the mouth a bit; mouthfeel is smooth, supple and a bit oily. Underneath the banana and the wheat, a very pleasant, soft bready maltiness provides structure. The finish continues the wheat sourishness and barley sweetishness, which keep lingering in the throat, but a leafy background hop bitterishness is added too, for structural purposes. I prefer Hefeweizen over Kristallweizen but in this style, this is surely among the most well-balanced examples Ive had. Has more fruit (banana) flavour than usual and finds perfect balance between its different flavour components. Weihenstephaner quality standard, Id even regard this as the archetypical example of its style.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a golden color with a fizzy white head of two fingers. The head fades relatively quickly, fading to leave a lighter level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is mainly of a grainy and bready smell mixed with aromas of some sweeter caramel and a bit of light fruits (banana, orange, and pear). Rounding out the aroma are some quite light but detectable aromas of some spice of clove and coriander as well as a yeasty cake aroma.

 Taste  The taste begins with a slightly grainy and moderately caramel sweetened flavor. As the taste advances some of the yeast and spice greet the tongue with the caramel fading but being replaced by some lighter fruit flavors of banana and citrus. More toward the end, a somewhat grassy flavor comes to the tongue as well as the grainy tastes seeming to amplify to some extent, with the mix of flavors in the end, leaving a rather nice clean and malty flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average side for a brew of 5.4 % abv with a carbonation level that is on the average side as well. Both are rather nice for the blend of grainy malt, sweet, and lightly hopped flavors of the beer and make for a very easy drinking brew.

 Overall  A nice very easy drinking brew with some great blend of tastes making it a nice flavorful drinker.","","Darkmagus82"

Purchased: April 19, 2013
Consumed: April 20, 2013
Misc.: Part of the bottle reads Brewed under the purity law, of 1516.

Poured a golden straw clear color with 4-5 fingers of pillowy head. Average-to-below average wet watery lacing. Below average-to-minimal retention on the top.

Completely different smells from skunky malts to banana and cloves. The banana and cloves (hefeweizen) seemed to take over. Grassy malts as well.

Tasted much smoother than the smell. Hefeweizen notes - banana, cloves, sweet sugary lemon notes, a bit of Circus Peanuts dominate here. Skunky, grassy, bready malt backbone wont go away though and is what ends up on my tongue when its all said and done.

Light body. Thin-to-oily texture. Average carbonation. Long, refreshing finish.

The nose is rater mellow and soft but rather enjoyable, mellow wheat with a touch banana, soft with some complimenting spices, mild cereal.

2603,"2012-08-02",3.7,"The beer is a crystal clear light golden hue. The beer is moderately effervescent. The head is thick, fluffy, white and generates a decent amount of lacing on the glass.

The aroma is very similar to that of Weihenstephaner Hefeweissbier, with scents of wheat, banana, and clove.

The taste is quite nice, and again, similar in many regards to the unfiltered version. The flavors are there, but perhaps a bit more subtle than the Hefeweissbier. The beer is not as refreshingly delicious either, as the unfiltered version packs such an enormous flavor punch that it completely masks any hint of alcohol.

The feel is smooth and clean, with a slight hint of alcohol in the very back. Carbonation level is medium to high.

A great beer overall. I definitely need to do a side by side compare and contrast session with this and the Hefeweissbier. Weihenstephaner just might be the best brewery in Germany.

2603,"2012-05-30",3.8,"500mL bottle from the Lickbow. Ah yes, the elusive Kristallweizen, finally I can notch this style on my figurative belt, but which I really mean my RB statistics. Its not as if I havent had clear wheat beers before, but the apparently special tag for a Kristalweiss has previously eluded me as well as many others. You would think that filtering a Hefeweiss would pretty much remove one of the central things that makes a Hefeweiss an interesting beer, but of course, Weihenstaphaner pulls it off well. These guys could ferment a beer in a babys diaper and it would probably still be less revolting than one would imagine. Okay maybe that was a dumb comparison. But they rock at producing awesome examples of styles which I would otherwise pass on, like their Dunkelweiss, and this is no different. Aroma has some nice sharp hops hiding under the sweet and vaguely yeasty elements. A tad spicy as well. Flavour is actually kind of rich, at least in the context of what I was expecting (not much). Pale and wheat malts are delicious, with some depth. Not overly carbonated, with the pleasant result that I can actually taste things. Finishes with that quintessential dry weirdness of wheat, but without the fruity characters you would get from Hefe yeast. But the fantastic malt body really makes up for the fruity-void. This beer is a 9/10, would bang. This rating is probably longer than it really needed to be.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

2603,"2012-05-12",3.4,"I recently enjoyed an American take on the kristallweizen style and it occurred to me that Ive never reviewed an authentic German brew of the style, so what better beer to opt for than Weihenstephaner Kristall Weissbier? Its best described as a wheat beer for lager drinkers as it has only the basic qualities of a traditional wheat, but without nearly the complexity or energy.

I poured a 500ml bottle into an official Weihenstephaner glass.

Appearance: Bright pale gold, crystal clear with plenty of visible carbonation present. Forms a huge, bright white, foamy head which eventually dissipates but doesnt leave much lacing on the glass.

Smell: A classic Bavarian wheat beer with half the aroma plus a hint of lager-like quality to it. Slight banana and lemonpeel, otherwise very mild.

Taste: I didnt know what to expect with Weihenstephaner Kristall Weissbier, but I was genuinely surprised when the palate seemed so overtly mild. It has a clean, slightly lemony, slightly watery taste up front. It slowly transitions to a more familiar wheat beer taste with light banana flavor and a subtle citrusy juiciness. Theres a biscuity maltiness in there, too - reminiscent of a Munich-style lager. The finish is crisp and clean, although thats a somewhat redundant statement since the majority of the palate is clean. 

Its not that this is a bad beer (far from it), its just much more mild than Id expect. Its possible I had an old bottle, but who knows? I found I was able to enjoy this drink since Im so familiar with the style and can concentrate on the subtleties in it that are flat-out overt in a more traditional wheat beer. Lager drinkers and general newbies will likely enjoy this beer more than seasoned veterans.

Drinkability: I drank this beer outside on a hot sunny day - the ideal setting for this type of beer. It went down very smoothly even though it was noticeably fizzy across the tongue like a lager. The mild palate and clean aftertaste made it quite refreshing. Its weight of 5.4% actually seems a little high since Weihenstephaner Kristall Weissbier seems so overtly mild overall. It does the job a wheat beer should do, and thats what matters.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

2603,"2012-05-04",3.5,"This beer was drank, as I reviewed it, on a Sunday afternoon at home (19 Nov 2006). 
Pint bottle, poured into a Franziskaner Weissbier glass, looks good, large head, which stayed a while, shrinking, but staying. light, bright golden colour with bubbles rising up the beer, bursting through head. 

The aroma is of wheat and bannanas, not as strong as other Weissbiers I have tried, but still in the nose. Maybe the process that clears the beer also takes away some of the aroma? 

Refeashing, clean taste, with wheat winning the battle of flavours over bannana and vanilla, but only just. 

Taste stays, getting more bitter as the mouth dries, take a long time between sips to feel this sensation. 

I would drink another one, but I will not go looking for it. I would like to try a few more Kristall Weissbiers (I have drank others, many years ago, on tap and in bottles) before I can say this is one of the best or not.

However, I was to be pleasantly surprised.  It pours a clear gold with a large white head and a light fizz.  On drinking its smooth and sweet, and somehow has hints of both a good wheat beer and a top-notch pilsner about it - grass, honey and lemon all come through, with a superb balance between them. Theres a pleasantly mellow banana and clove flavour lurking behind.  Finishing slightly dry, it manages to be both refreshing and comforting at the same time.

The taste is great, full of that lovely Weihenstephaner wheatiness which is so flavoursome, though the Kristall Weissbier isnt as flavoursome as the unfiltered original. Full of summer vibes, incredibly grassy, banana, bubblegum, fresh with a lovely wheaty aftertaste which harnesses a little nuttiness too.

Taste is lightly sweet and lightly sour. 

Thin bodied with a thin texture. Very fizzy carbonation and not much to speak of on finish. 

Overall, its not too bad. A little too light for my taste. Nothing I would seek out again but something to try once. Maybe good for drinking outside on a hot summer day.","Rockford, Illinois, USA","jmagnus87"

This is where the banana really comes into play, in the taste. Not as strong as the un-clear version though. And big sweetness in the taste. But in a good way, not cloying.
Prickly mouth-feel. This beer is very carbonated and leaves a sensation and taste somewhat like sparkling mineral water in your mouth. Not the best thing to have left over after the sweet banana taste you just swallowed. Slightly detracts from the overall experience.

2603,"2010-06-10",4.6,"Aroma: Yeast, which is weird because this ale should be a filtered version of the much acclaimed hefe. Upon second whiff Im picking up the clove and herbal notes of the Bavarian Weiss. 
Appearance: Took me three trys to get this beer into its proper glass and with all that effort I now have a ""Krystal"" clear champagne-like hefe with a huge frothy head! With the time Ive spent admiring this ale the foam has faded but I still have a solid inch. The bubbles are racing up the side to replenish as fast as they can. The clear body is slightly unusual, but thats the intention for this one. 
Taste/Palate: Wow! Big fruit and yeast with strong acidity and a wonderful carbonated spritz! The ale begs to be sweet but the reigns are on which gives robust flavor and body but with a graciously light mouth-feel. Bavarias response to the clear beer trend. I could drink this beer all day!

A - Clear bright golden color. Big, billowy white head with good retention and lacing.

S - Lots of wheat that gives it a bready aroma. Also has fruits (apple and banana), and spice (clove), with hints of other fruits and spices.

T - Similar to the smell. A lot like a subdued Hefe, with a bit less wheat flavor and a bit more hop presence.

M - Crisp and fairly light bodied. High carbonation.

D - Really drinkable, light and crisp and refreshing. The flavors are really nice. Easy on the palate but enough of the nice Hefe flavors that I want to drink more.

Notes: Really nice beer, but I would probably just go for their normal Hefe. That isnt a slam on this beer as the normal Hefe is amazing and this is a lot like it. I guess if you wanted a clean/lighter version go for this.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Soft nose of yeast and crystal wheat along with a hint of banana and bread. Full mouthfeel, very pleasant and satisfying, with the carbonation quite active but not overpowering or getting in the way of the flavors. Spicy and dry flavors at the outset complement the breadiness, but theres something about the brew that makes it wash out towards the finish, in a fairly pronounced way - docked a point for that.

Appearance: The body has a clear golden color with lots of beautiful carbonation steaming up to the surface. The pour produced a very tall, aggressive and tight foamy head. It has a bright white color with great retention and lacing.

Smell: Its nose is full of fruity yeast with notes of banana and clove. There are notes of pale beady wheat as well and just a touch of citrus.

Taste/Palate: The flavor is very bright and fresh with plenty of fruity yeast. There are notes of banana, clove and a slight hint of citrus fade into dry crisp wheat malt notes. The finish is very crisp and snappy with some wheat tang and citrus quickly leaving the tongue. The body has a solid medium feel with cleansing active carbonation.

2603,"2009-08-05",3.1,"8/05/2009:  Weihenstephaner Kristall Weissbier...  Aroma:  Like a hefe crossed with an American Wheat beer - Wheat and slightly sour with delicate spice and a hint of bubblegum, but lacking the typical Hefe yeastiness and rich banana.  Appearance:  Beautiful, near perfect pour into my Aynger 0.5 l weizen glass; crystal clear appearance; pale sunshine golden yellow color; puffy, lasting white head thats two fingers deep and has stiff peaks; fast and furious carbonation, generous amount and quite lively; hanging puffy lacing on the glass. Flavor:  Lightly wheaty with dry biscuit malt in the middle along with a subtle level of clove and bubblegum, crisp and grassy finish.  Palate:  Light and refreshing, airy mouthfeel without being overcarbonated.  Overall:  I guess it was about time to sample the only beer style on RateBeer than I had not yet checked off the list.  This beer is supposedly the best of the style, but I have never been a big fan of either the Weihenstephaner brewer or the German Kristallweizen.  There is nothing wrong with this style or particular beer per se, but lets be honest about this...  German Kristallweizen : German Hefeweizen :: Pale Lager : Pilsener.  Why not just drink the ""real"" thing?!

This tastes very light and crisp, with some wheat malt, and is clearly a summer beer.

It began with a rocky white head, two fingers thick above a body that was clear and gold.

2603,"2009-05-08",3.5,"Admittedly, wheat beers of any kind arent my favorite. I can appreciate what they offer, and the fact they they are extremely quenching on a hot day, but most of the time theres not a lot to hang your tastebuds on (unless of course you get a top notch German hefe). I wouldnt call this one top notch, but its still good. 

The beer pours out a pale yellow color, brilliantly clear with a extra large, 4 finger thick head. Pillowy, bubbyly and foamy would be the best way to describe it. The head disipates rather quickly, and leaves behind some spotty lacing, but the clarity of the beer is nice. Aroma has lots, and lots of bubblegum, a bit dusty, crackers and a touch of banana. Flavors carried some spicyness, a bit of mashed banana and bubblegum while still having some grassy character to round it out. Finish is crisp with no lingering bitterness.

Very Appetizing with a fruity, banana-like, bubble gum taste that gives way to a gentle, tapering finish with a Juicy-Fruit gum aftertaste.  This self-proclaimed ""Worlds oldest"" brewery makes a very fine filtered wheat beer (although this very modern interpretation is far from being the worlds oldest wheat beer recipe).

2603,"2008-02-29",3.5,"A careful pour produces a frothy, initially four-finger thick, pale tan colored head.  The beer is brilliantly clear, with lots of carbonation bubbles streaming through a bright, yellow gold colored beer.  The aroma has the characteristic notes of clove, a touch of banana, a hint of spiciness, some dusty crushed malt aromatics and soft bread-like notes.  It seems to be missing a tart wheat component to it and leaves me wondering if this is enhanced by suspended yeast in the traditional Weizen mit Hefe.  As a substitute though there is a spicy note that I dont usually get, really it is a black pepper note that is both slightly woody as well as spicy.

Sweet tasting and well carbonated, the beer foams up as it hits my tongue.  Smooth flavors of clove, a touch of banana up front, noticeable sweet (almost honey-like) grain, touches of peach.  The carbonation combines with other notes to produce a peppery finish to the beer; in the near finish it competes with the sweet grain and clove notes, but in the long finish it becomes much more noticeable.  As the carbonation subsides the feel of this beer becomes much more creamy; it is still quite easy drinking and most definitely quite quaffable.

The Hefe definitely adds some complexity (whether you pour in the sediment or not), but this is a pretty nice beer.  I definitely like that the clove and some of the banana flavors are easily noticed and I find that that interesting pepper-like note adds a bit of intrigue to what might have been only a decent Weissbier.

I picked this up at a local store after finding it on the shelf following a recent expansion.  Given the price ($2.79) I didnt have too high of an expectation especially since it is a kristallweizen.  Still you dont get the chance to try these very often so when I ran across it I decided it was worth checking out.
Aroma / Appearance - A fast growing head surged to the top of my glass before slowly settling into a thin layer of white.  Underneath was a transparent yellow body that look like most pale lagers.  Tart lemon, wheat and a hint of sour drop candy combined to form an pleasing but basic bouquet.
Flavor / Palate - Citrus and freshly mowed grass merge then almost immediately disappear.  The light aftertaste reminds me of the crumbs at the bottom of a bag of banana chips.  Its not bad though Ill stick to hefeweizens to get my regular session fix.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

2603,"2007-11-11",3.2,"Ive finally rated all the styles (I dont count low alcohol and malt liquor) - hugely effervescent, clear golden beer, with a gigantic, frothy, bright white head that continues to grow even after the pour - the beer looks so lively that it just begs you to drink it - strong banana aroma, with strong wheat malt earthiness and subtle hints of orange and spices (clove is dominant, of course) - the carbonation is not as prickly as I expected - very light bodied beer - light honey sweetness and very faint wheat character - a hint of phenolics way in the back - very light clove spice and faint flower flavors - not much going on here - its a shame, it start ed out so well, then I had to go and taste the stuff.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

2603,"2007-10-30",3.0,"UPDATED: JUL 18, 2010 This is the second time Im rating this beer.  Im being a lot more gentle on it this time.  Its really an unusual drinking experience that I have a hard time describing.  Its less ""grainy"" than an ordinary Hefeweizen, and Im not sure if I like that or not.  The nose smells like a hefe, but the taste is more sharp and pilsnerish, yet it still tastes like a Hefe.  Its really confusing to my palate.  Maybe this style serves some purpose as an adaptation of Hefe to really hot weather, but if its that hot I usually just reach for a Kolsch.  I dont think I like it as much as a regular Hefe, as much as it confuses me.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","FastEddie"

It pours a very light golden color, almost looks like a light offering from an American mass domestic, but the pour produces a beautiful frothy white head.  The head lasted for quite a while on top of a mildly fizzy beer.  The aroma delivered the pleasant and expected estery and fruity notes, predominantly banana.

2603,"2007-05-10",3.6,"Rated 1/1/06:  Picked a bottle of this up during a visit to my fovorite beer store. Had no idea what to expect especially since I am not familiar with kristall weissbiers. I was able to conclude that it was German weisbeer. The appearance was fantastic, very light golden in color with plenty of carbonation. The bubbles seem to be infinite. After a couple of glass fulls I was still confused as to the unique ingredient. It wasnt until I began to read the reviews that I learned that banana seems to be the main influence here. Interesting to say the least it is an extremely unique beer. So far I can take it or leave it.

Fizzy, yellow? may fool the BMC drinkers, that is until they smell it. The aroma is very yeasty, spicy, and wheaty. There also seems to be a bit of a skunkiness. Flavor is wheat, yeast, and mild esters. Mild tartness. Full mouthfeel, probably due in large part to the high level of carbonation. I am not sure if it is the fact that it is a kristalweizen, getting old, or just a poor example of style, but the traditional hefe yeast character is just not present, almost seems like an AmWheat.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

The initial head was too much for the bottle to fit quickly into the 0.5L glass, and the head lasted the whole drink, although at a thinner level than the initial showing. Lacing was low to average. The aroma was somewhat American wheaty (musty?) with bananas and spices coming through. The flavor was excellent with bananas and cloves over top of the mildly citrus wheat base.

2603,"2006-05-25",3.4,"(500 ml bottle: $2.99 at Hollingshead Deli in Orange, CA) I didnt expect much from this Kristallweizen, not because its Weihenstephaner, but because I havent found one in the style that I liked so far.  Until now, that is.  Very pleasant spice and moderate banana immediately set the tone early, and I cant stop myself from just sucking this first pint down like Im dying of thirst.  Its mildly sweet and shows no bitterness at all.  I think the beer tastes better when its cold because Im finding that as it warms up, the breadiness of the malt is coming out more and slowly pushing aside the wonderful spice, banana and bubblegum that I was digging earlier.  Spice and bubblegum aromas mimic the flavor.  Body is light-medium, with significant levels of carbonation keeping the palate refreshed and the stomach burpy.  Relatively clear, yellow body is capped by well over an inch of bubbly, white head.  Retention is above average as the head maintains a thin layer for most of the session.  Lacing is patchy.

Classic German weizen aroma of sweet bananas and wheat (expected spice didnt eventuate).  Tart wheat with some background lolly-like malt in the mouth, up front.  Fierce carbonation comes to the fore now, making the beers aromatics and flavour explode in the mouth - much like creaming soda.  More tartness and some clove in the dry finish.

In my opinion, this lighter style misses the mark as compared with other weissbeirs with bottle yeastespecially the hefeweissen offerings from Weihenstephan.  Body and mouthfeel are markedly different.  The aroma is also quite muted.  There is a bit of malt and bread in the nose, but just a whiff of the expected citrus aroma.  Palate entry is dry and the flavor spectrum reveals a hint of the citrus and spice typical of hefeweissen styles.  The brief dry finish reveals traces of alcohol.

Round yeastiness, quite fruity. As good as a slightly above average hefe in the nose. A bit thinner and less powdery in mouth, smoother carbonation than the agression I expected. Lemon pie, crusty breadiness and pleasant tart wheat flavors. Despite its general blandness which is of course okay for the style, this eludes me by managing to be fairly elegant. I hate to say it frankly. Id feel like ranting on the ""pride in filtration"" nature of kristallweizens tonight, but since the style realistically wont exist anymore in a few years, I guess its not worth the effort.

Have to admit a prejudice, though: I just can't get behind filtered wheat beers, especially when they come from an excellent producer such as Weihenstephaner. That wheat texture is so refreshing and rewarding in the best examples of the style, when I taste a non-HEFE weissbier, I can only think of what I'm missing.
There's a plasticy, bubblegum taste, too, just to the left of the vanilla/clove combo we find in great (and not-so-great) Bavarian weissbiers.
In this heat, though, it'll so, but it will be largely forgotten, especially as I down it quickly in order to get at the Weihenstephaner Dunkel Weisse in the fridge!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

Medium body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation. Pleasant but nothing more.  A little too syrupy-sweet, as is now the case with their Hefeweisse too.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2603,"2002-02-12",3.6,"I normally avoid filtered wheat beers as stripping the yeast out takes a lot of the flavour away but this particular example seems to be better than some of the blander hefe weissbiers. Lots of cloves and bananas with a muted phenolic twang, nice big head and fruity finish.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
2603,"2002-02-10",3.1,"Nice clean aroma, and as someone said earlier a definite champagne-like appearance in the glass.  The color is pale yellow, with a lingering and foamy white head.  Taste is clean and somewhat crisp as well, but nothing distinct stands out for me.  I keep waiting for something to come to me like it usually does when I describe the taste of beer, but it isnt happening.  I try to put words to the taste, but I just remind myself of the fragrant, bubbly, yet nondescript taste.  It isnt bad at all---its good---but its lacking something.  I definitely prefer the Hefe to this one.","Sherman, Texas, USA","unixweb"
2603,"2002-02-09",3.7,"Nice wheat aroma.  Champagne-like carbonation and a quite persistent head.  Light golden yellow color.  Spritzy, nice wheat flavor and some citrusiness.  Very lively finish, with a pleasant aftertaste.  Mmm!","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
2603,"2001-10-23",3.9,"Decent strength for the color. Too syrupy; not crisp enough for my taste. All in all, quite above average but just shy of outstanding.","LaVista, Nebraska, USA","K-V-F-L"

2603,"2001-10-03",3.3,"UPDATED: MAR 22, 2004 Very smooth, fruity and perfumey, but is definitely nowhere near the amazingness of the hefe. rer8: very sweet, lollyish, with banana, bubblegum and lemon. not much in the way of guts but crisp and easy to drink. a very good gurly beer.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"
2603,"2001-07-29",4.0,"Incredible that so much flavor can be packed into such a light colored brew. Toned down weiss flavors without the yeast but a very german beer none the less. Crisp and refreshing.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"
2603,"2001-07-29",3.9,"Clear golden color, with a lacey ring of foam. Smells of banana bread, very sweet and fruity aroma. Light and sweet taste, slightly flowery and banana taste pervades. Sweet and mellow, a nice drinking experience.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
2603,"2001-07-26",4.0,"Copper/brown, clear, no head.  Yeasty, banana aroma.  Crisp and refreshing, the dominant flavors are subtle banana and a hint of pumpkin pie; slightly sweet. Much lighter than a normal weissbier, with no bitterness and non-existent hop presence. Slightly yeasty aftertaste.  Excellent, although not as flavorful or enticing as their unfiltered hefe.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
2603,"2001-06-25",4.2,"Outstanding wheat beer - soft mouthfeel, perfectly balanced citrus notes and a banana touch that sums it all up.  A must have.","Palm Beach Gardens, FL, Florida, USA","blatz"
