2380,"2015-10-11",3.5,"Draft at brewery. Cask version in white oak. Pleasant citrus aroma, orange? Flavor bit too malty but that is my only complaint. Figure white oak barrel throwing it off.","Florida, USA","Clarkdvm"
2380,"2015-02-02",3.6,"11/19/14. On tap at The Craft Bar, Destin. Hazy Amber pour with a small khaki head, mild lacing. Wow, huge orange aroma, light wood, smells like grapefruit juice. Sweet flavor, lots of orange and grapefruit, which was great at first but became too much after awhile... started getting me thinking of candles. Not bad.","Georgia, USA","drowland"
2380,"2015-01-17",4.0,"Tap at WOB. Hazy red gold pour. Huge red grapefruit aroma, awesome. Smooth malt medium body with big grapefruit notes. Really good.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
2380,"2014-12-17",3.3,"Sweet, prominent honey orange blossom aroma. Hazy bronze. Body is a lot lighter than the aroma implies. Seltzery, tastes a bit like orange tic tacs or baby aspirin. Dissapointed. On tap, Tucker Dukes.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"
2380,"2014-11-23",2.8,"Pours a drab cider color with no head. Pungent, clean apricot and tangerine nose. Full mouthfeel and slightly oily, with nice carbination. Not nearly as flat as it appears. Like drinking liquid apricot-tangerine hard candy. Big flavor, just not sure it belongs in a beer. Its hard for me to believe that this flavor was imparted by just barley and hops. Seems rather unnatural.","Pensacola, Florida, USA","DocJitsu"
2380,"2014-11-14",4.3,"Poured up on tap at Star Bar Denver where it exhibits a deep copper body that has thin gold edges and supports a thin white head of foam. The aroma is just straight up tangelo citrus gummy bear like candy goodness that smells oh so juicy and inviting. Around the edges of the aroma are thin bitter citrus notes. The taste is similar where there is just big smooth sweet citrus gummy bear candy tangerine and tangelo notes picking up just a bit of juicy mango before more and more bitter citrusy grapefruit notes are noticed. To midway it gains a bit of Smartys citrus sweet/tart candy notes that are going very well here as well as some floral hoppiness. Entered as an Amberr Ale? Wow.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
2380,"2014-10-20",4.2,"Deep amber pour, light head. Shared some with the CCB crew at Star Bar. Man what a killer beer. Looks dark like it would be sweet and sticky...but when you taste it the citrus pops. Fresh ruby red grapefruit, oranges, zest. Just a juicy and delicious beer!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
2380,"2014-06-04",3.9,"draft at resurrection for PBW event..holy cow the aroma on this is intense..like walking into the middle of citrus field covered with grapefruit and orange..nose is off the charts..flavor profile follows the nose..fairly easy drinking but seems like the highlight of this one was the nose..easily the most citrus forward nose I can remember coming across...taste comes across as more like fresh squeezed juice than anything else..kind of a confusing beer to match with any particular style..but a few things are certain..this is citrusy and fresh tasting for sure....","Delaware, USA","HeadyDE"
2380,"2014-06-04",4.2,"Draft at bar, pours brown amber with medium off white head. Nose is candy orange, tangerine, cedar, marmalade, sprees, orange Turkish delight and funky hops. Love this flavor profile, only complaint is its a little too artificial tasting. Medium body nice carb. Still awesome.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
2380,"2014-02-17",3.7,"Draft at the Sybarite Pig in Boca Raton, FL. Small snifter draft pour. A deep amber pour with a thick white head. You can smell the citrus from about three feet away. Serious grapefruit/orange/lime aroma with a hint of pine and biscuit. The taste was the same with copious amounts of citrus flavors bursting from lips to gullet. Finish is dry, but citrus and pine.","Boca Raton, Florida, USA","Fritz123"
2380,"2013-12-30",3.1,"Tap at ccb. Muddy amber with white head and good lacing. Huge citrus juice aroma, lemon lime orange grapefruit. Very juicey. Can smell much else. Taste is super juice. Even the texture is juicey. A little bit of toasted grain is present. Not enough beer taste and kind of a mess.","Sarasota, Florida, USA","stevencon"
2380,"2013-10-08",3.8,"Holy citrus. This beer pours a golden color from the tap. All you can smell is citrus. Wow! The taste is more of the same. Citrus, grapefruit, pine! It is a good beer.-- via beerbasher/winphone","Safety Harbor, Florida, USA","Daniel719"
2380,"2012-10-05",4.1,"I really liked this one. The aroma here was intense orange and tangerine with a pine hop bite. Pour is amber colored with a white head. Flavor is intense hops, with a ton of citrus and pine flavors and a malty backbone. My only complaint is that the bitterness on this one just hangs on the palate for a long time.","Florida, USA","OmegaX"
2380,"2012-10-05",3.9,"This tasted like an amber ale, but had the aroma of a pungent IPA. Lots of fresh oranges and hops in the aroma - zesty almost! The taste is just as sweet, and with the light carbonation you are left with a fantastic tartness. Great stuff!!!","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"
2380,"2012-10-04",3.8,"Pint pour at the brewery. Deep hazed amber/brown. Aroma is an orange... Thats it... Intense, straight, heavenly juicy orange. But also a mild citrus from grapefruit to lemon and a touch of caramel malt character. Flavor is much less intense, ranging from heavy citrus and lighter fruits to caramel and toffee. Much more malt noticeable on the mouth than nose. But in a good way. Overall, a nice amber that drinks with a smooth hop. Well done.","Florida, USA","tricyclist"
2380,"2012-10-03",3.6,"Growler. Enjoyed in a wine glass. Dark amber ale. 1 finger head fades slowly. Smells of jolly ranchers, candied oranges and cedar. Taste is similar. Sort of an astringent cough syrup taste. Overall, a glass of it is great. Nice to share for sure.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
2380,"2012-10-01",3.5,"On tap at cc: aroma of hops and grapfruit for me. Pours a murky amber. Taste of grapfruit and yes its quiet tasty. Definetely an ipa "" feel"" all around. More so than a red ale.  Nice beer for breakfast!","Tampa, Florida, USA","kabsetter"
2380,"2012-09-30",3.9,"On draft at Cigar City, pours a light amber orange color, aromas of citrus, orages, light grapefruit, light cedar, and some more wood.  Flavors of some light spicy cedar, lots of citrus, and a touch of bitterness in the aftertaste.  Interesting beer overall.","Florida, USA","burg326"
2380,"2012-09-29",3.7,"Pours golden brown Aroma of cedar, citrus and hops.  Taste is a citrus bomb, so nice to drink, like orange grapefruit beer.  Citrusy and bitter cedar plays nice doesn't over pour. Easy drinking and refreshing

2380,"2012-09-29",4.0,"On draft at Cigar City.  Pours a hazy orange with a white head.  Nose is a burst of those beautiful New Zealand hops- notes of pine, grapefruit, and tropical fruit, along with some cedar, and a nice malt presence.  Flavor is a balance of all of these notes.  I am not sure how I like the cedar in it, but it grew on me as I drank it.  Maybe one day theyll do a Citrus Mage or Citrus Apprentice that does not have the cedar?  Medium in body and pretty great.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
