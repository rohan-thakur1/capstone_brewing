4110,"2015-07-13",3.6,"Housebeer of the Schepdaal restaurant of the same name, a kind of hybrid between faro and oude kriek - which is almost certainly what it is, namely a blend of Girardins Oude Kriek, Faro and young lambic. Generously offered by the proprietor upon entering the pub preceding the restaurant area. Sticky, stable, densely moussy, off-white head, creamy, over a hazy amber coloured lambic beer. Aroma of sour cherries, sweet sherry, bitter honey, leather, redcurrant, lemon zest accent, candi sugary accent. Sweetish candi sugar touch at first, followed by the tartness of sour cherries but remaining rounded and soft, smooth, sherryish, soft carbo, honeyish accent, drying sourness and woodiness in the finish, where the candi sweetishness lingers as well; the last impression strangely reminded me of aspartame, which would be quite out of place here. Interesting, but should not have been sweetened so much; still, it has a enough drought, woodiness and complexity to still qualify as a full-fledged lambic beer worth a taste. Glad I finally tasted this after having been familiar with only the name for so many years.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
4110,"2015-05-04",3.2,"Dark red 2 finger off white head. The aroma is light, a little fruity with a mild bitterness. Taste is nice. Has a jonge lambiek taste, a bit of prune, rose hips and malt character. Interesting beer","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
4110,"2015-05-04",3.7,"Thanks to AdamJackson! Draft glass @ Rare Vos. Clear amber, little white head. Nose is light candy sweet, malty, iron, light sweetish cherries, sugar, bit Faro-like. Taste is just dull but okay, candy sugar, sweetish, plenty of iron, candy, bit dull sweetish cherries, Low carbonation. Rather sweet & iron-like. Rather dull but okay but not all unblended Girardin is always that pleasant. Okay but not interesting for beer geeks. Okay for an everyday beer.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
4110,"2015-04-12",3.4,"Really sure I did type a rating of this beer before, but somehow it disappeared along the way, and the original beer card (bierviltje) I wrote the rating on is of course long gone already. From memory then: According to the waitress it was a Girardin made blend of the Krieken- and regular lambic. Bit tart, quite fruity, butter. Interesting beer, worked well with the garnalenkroketjes.
Warrants a re-rate.

4110,"2014-06-15",2.5,"On tap at De Rare Vos, pours a clear bronze with a medium white head. Nose is fairly light, with a tiny amount of funk and berries. Flavour is light and fruity, with various berries, very subtle funk, and sparkling water. Not very complex at all - barely even drinks like a lambic, more like a lightly sour ale, with a light fruitiness and vinegary quality. Not very good.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
4110,"2012-10-14",3.7,"Tap at Rare Vos. It pours deep amber, with a reddish hue and thick white head. The nose is hay, floral, some tangy dark fruit and zesty grapefruit. The taste is tangy fruit, raisin, cherry, redcurrant, melon, apricot, floral aspect, rose water, pith and wood, with a dry, bitter finish. Medium body, fine carbonation and foamy mouth-feel. Lowish sourness, more tangy really. Well balanced and pretty drinkable. More hop presence than I was expecting, but I enjoyed nonetheless. Unique.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
4110,"2012-10-06",3.4,"Amber colored beer with an off-white head. Moderate tartness with a fairly substantial fruity sweetness. A bit of malt, some cherry, grass, and a mild oak aroma. The flavor is a touch sweet with some sugar, malt, and cherry notes. A moderate tartness, some lemon zest, and a bit of grass. Mild oak flavor in the background.

4110,"2012-04-23",3.2,"Pours a dark golden amber, transparent, creamy off white head and a lot of lace.  The nose offers sweet caramel and candied fruit with a touch of a metallic twang and some light cherry behind.  The taste is a little more put together, still very sweet.  Notes of lemon zest and some lightly soured cherry on top of caramel and candied sugars.  Lighter body, soft on the palate and very creamy.  Decent carbonation and a semi dry finish.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"
4110,"2011-07-16",3.1,"Hazy light amber, small bubbled white head that reduces quickly but leaves considerable lacing. Grainy nose has dust, toast, and yeast, considerable sweetness, and a bit of souring citrus. Flavor is sweet, more faro like with the grainy, offset sourness, derived mainly in citrus,  but the grain is too spicy even for that and so the malt is too evident. A blatant contrast that doesnt work well","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
4110,"2011-06-16",3.8,"tap at rare vos.   pours a lightly hazed amber with bright orange highlights and a large frothy dirty white head.  leaves some intricate lacework on the glass.  good lookin beer.   aroma of earthy brown sugar, mixed berries, and yogurt.  taste is silky dry cherries, toasted bread, complimented by some nice yogurt sourness.  well made.  strangely, the fruit-lambic combo comes across almost like a hoppy pale ale fruit beer.  unique.  interesting.  nice balance.  pretty good.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
4110,"2010-09-20",4.0,"Draught, at the pub of the same name.  Ruby red, pink head.  Taste is sweet, sour and bitter at different stages of the sampling.  More prominent hop profile than most.  Interesting and unique.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
4110,"2010-09-17",3.3,"Sampled July 2010, from the tap at Rare Vos
This arrives with a frothy, one-finger thick, pale, lightly tan colored head.  The beer is a red, brilliantly clear color that shows a dark amber sheen to it.  This smells of caramelization, somewhat beery (not very Lambic like), has a hint of tartness to it and somewhat fruity with a berry like character that comes through softly.  This is interesting, if a bit industrial smelling somehow.

The beer tastes nicely tart as it first hits my tongue; it is very refreshing and maybe even has some hop character to it.  It finishes with a slight bite that is a mix of hop bitterness and carbonic acid.  This is somewhat sweet tasting, but this is pretty well balanced by the soft tartness.  This is very cool and refreshing on this muggy, hot day.  The texture is somewhat viscous and has a light-medium body.

I really wonder how Girardin makes this beer, it is likely a blend with a bit of Lambic in it and some caramel color; quite weird in some ways, I am really not quite too sure what to think.  In the end this is a bit simplistic, but still nice.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4110,"2008-08-24",3.9,"Draught @ De Rare Vos Schepdaal. Is this beer a lambic, partly, yes. It is more like a flemish brown mixed with lambic, sort of a Jack Op. And a very good one! Strong aroma of caramel, wood and a hint of cherry. Sweetish, sourish caramelly flavor. Thin, with citrus and wood in the finish. Lovely!","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"

4110,"2006-12-11",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2007 On tap at the Rare Vos. Aroma of cherries with faint citrus and fainter brass. This is an aged blend of lambic and faro than ends up fruity and refreshing. Deep reddish-copper color, thin head. Very refreshing, tempting to gulp. The blend of sweet and sour adds complexity instead of canceling each other out, thankfully, and the fruit adds further character. Cherries are strong before the musty, mature finish you expect from a Girardin gueuze. One of a kind, worth the drive if youre visiting Brussels.","Berlin, GERMANY","JoeinDahlem"

4110,"2006-06-29",4.2,"On tap at De Rare Vos, Schepdaal. Hazy, deep amber colour with a small, off-white head. Complex aroma of citric fruitiness and that definite geuze character.

4110,"2006-06-11",3.6,"UPDATED: AUG 8, 2007 Draught glass
Consumed at De Rare Vos Cafe, Schepdaal, May 2006  Clear dark amber/copper colored body with a toast colored tan head.  Toasty nose of chalky wood, spices, and light cinnamon.  Up front it’s a bit like a flemish sour ale, then it turns to a toasty cinnamon and cedar wood flavor, then finishes with a light sourness.  Interesting and different, though not exemplar.

4110,"2006-06-05",3.6,"Amber, orange, a little unclear, huge creamy white head; Not huge, but very upfront complex nose, it seems as a clear mix Lambic, Krieken Lambic and Faro: unripe apple, grapefruit juice and peel, cherry and cherry pit, brown sugar, candied sugar; Quite acidy (pricking) medium full a bit watery body; Into long finish starting of a grapefruity acidy growing into harsh grapefruit peel, later some malt appears, even later the finish becomes very faro like with brown sugar and the mixed aroma of candied sugar and cinnamon that you find in some biscuits (in Denmark called Bastogne-biscuits). It is a fine beer, but I guess you have to be a Schepdaal local to really appreciate this unclear mix of styles. Great bar by the way!","Aarhus, DENMARK","henrikb"
4110,"2006-03-16",3.3,"Draught at  De Rare Vos, Schepdaal, Belgium (only place available!).Tall off-white head, clear dark amber body. Mild sweet malty with a slightly acidid tone in the aroma. Notes of brown sugar. Flavor is pretty mild as well with a sourish note. Citrus, hints of wood and a sugary character in the middle. Sparkling mouthfeel. A nice and easy drinkable beer, but not outstanding.","Brooklyn, Alabama, USA","Jeppe"
4110,"2006-03-06",3.7,"Draught @ Rare Vos in Schepdaal: Amber coloured. Quite clear. White dense huge head. Acidic and quite fruity and sweet in the nose. Definately sugar added to this beer. Reminds me a little of Faro, which isnt so special given the fact that this beer is a blend of lambic, gueuze, faro and a forth ingredient from Girardin (Jacob Löwenlunds theory is that its the Ulricher Pilsner). Is well balanced and sweet with an acidic and light sour note. Medium bodied. Ends on a quite fruity note.","Søborg, DENMARK","madsberg"
