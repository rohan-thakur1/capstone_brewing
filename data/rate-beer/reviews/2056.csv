2056,"2012-10-16",3.7,"July 11th, 2010 - The difference between a hot, sweltering, glaring summer day and a classy afternoon spent bathing in a golden, antique colored light can be the difference between a glass of tepid tap water and a glass of a French Saison brew. The Biere du Mars from Bieres 23 is one such Saison - a beautiful golden shine in the afternoon sun, and a core of carbonation that looks like a geologic-event-in-a-glass. Springy and fresh, the aroma is clear and clarifying, with a touch of honey, some bitter astringency, and the familiar aromas of hay that I often find in this style. A bit overwhelming at first, the flavor mellows as it traverses the tongue, sprinkling flavors of grains, hay, and grassy astringency as it goes, and ending with a flourish of apple cider on a palate that grows and inflates even in the aftertaste. This is a slow sipper, but gives a lot of taste.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
2056,"2012-09-03",3.9,"Bottle at Churchkey. Clear golden color, almost flat. Aroma of dried apple skins, lemon, white pepper, straw. Taste is like dry cider with a malt backbone. Very nice.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"

2056,"2011-07-29",3.9,"Man, this one caught me by surprise. Was not expecting the level of bossness that I encountered here. Had a weird cap/no carbonation on opening. Nevermind all that, awesome nose. Bretty and lemony. Notes of lemongrass, white pepper, hay, hibiscus, and citrus zest. Lightly acidic and acetic in the flavor. Lots of lemon rind and a prominent floral character. Very nice. Light body and low carbonation. Huzzah, best biere de garde/mars ever","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
2056,"2011-06-21",4.0,"Excellent farmhouse ale. Pours light gold, not a lot head. Aroma stikes with a wonderful wild yeast/brett punch. Flavor also brings the funk, some honey notes, very well defined beer, great lingering acidic finish","USA","Mystery_Tramp"

2056,"2011-05-09",3.5,"750mL courtesy of ryan. The pour is a cloudy light gold with really zero head forming. White bubbles emerge. Aroma is a nice fruity Brett infection (Brett A and/or C) with pineapple, cotton candy, soft lemon, mild vinegar, and rustic hay. Body is sharp and Bretty with cork notes, wood, lemon tea, sweet citrus, pear and tart peach. Very nice. Palate is lacking, carbonation a little fizzy. Body is thin, especially for Biere de Garde. Would be great with some head retention ;)","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

2056,"2010-11-12",3.6,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2010 Pours gold into a tulip. Bright white head quickly recedes to hug rim after a vigorous pour. Sourdough and marshmallow aromas. Spritzy but a little thin with sour apple from front to back into a lasting finish.  Not a lot of depth or balance when cold - tastes almost like a white wine.... Interesting yeast funk develops as it warms improving the overall experience.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
2056,"2010-08-16",3.8,"Bottle at Beerwarming Party. Pours a hazy gold with low, white head. Lots of funk in the aroma, with notes of barnyard and leather, along with some light malts and earthy bitters. Flavor is funky with with leather, light bread, grass and earth. Light to medium in body with average carbonation. Finishes earthy and dry with bitter grass. Not too bad.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
2056,"2009-11-23",3.9,"Pours a cloudy blonde color with a medium head and a fizziness akin to champagne. The aroma is some light lemon and light barnyard funk with some fresh hay. Rustic! The flavor is bready and bone dry with notes of lemon zest and a very good hop bitterness. Not the most complex thing in the world but its perfectly crafted and exactly to my taste!","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
2056,"2009-10-09",3.9,"thanks to Solan!  Very floral aroma with traces of funk, smells great!  Pours a slightly cloudy golden blonde with a thick white head.

2056,"2009-10-09",4.1,"Lightly hazy gold. Small white head. Aroma of fresh fruits, past ripe fruits, mild sourness. Same flavors. Expertly balanced sweet, sour, funk, and bitterness. Great aromas and flavors. Medium body, balanced. Excellent biere de mars.","Florida, USA","SoLan"
2056,"2009-10-01",4.0,"Bottle.Pours a deep, cloudy, funky, yeast-bit heavy cheddar orange with a fresh aroma of zesty floral lemon peel and a hint of orange grown near a cedar tree.  Very light and pleasing nose; reminds me of a fresh meadow just as the sun is rising and the dew is slowly drying.  Flavor is a watery floral hops with a stringent vein of lemony grass clippings.  Cedar bits and a light dusting of fruity and bready yeast round out the tastes.  Nice, zesty and tingly mouthfeel.  A pleasant beer; one to be sipped and savored.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"
2056,"2009-09-27",3.9,"Bottle. Pours opaque orange with a thin white head. Aroma of sweet apricot, tart orange, sweet malt and bitter hops. Tart orange flavor up front with some bitter hops and a malty finish. Other than the thin finish, no complaints here.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
2056,"2009-09-17",3.6,"Pours a murky, orangey, honey color with a gushing, white, frothy, average head which settles quickly to a very small, frothy, lasting layer and leaves some, tight, Belgian lace.  Nose is very refreshing and complex but subtle; a light sour note of overripe kiwi, lots of fresh flowers, musty yeast, some light barnyard notes, minerally, and faint wet earth.  Flavor is bit of a disappointment for me; notes of light grains, some honey, some very faint but tart lemons, and some fresh grass into the finish.  Not much of the complexities or funkiness that I got from the nose.  Palate is okay with a medium body, a semi-dry but refreshing feel, and a soft to lively carbonation.  The finish is quick with a lightly dry, a moderately light bitterness, and notes of minerals, fresh grass, some bretty tartness (lemons).  A very nice sessionable, Biere de Garde, almost Biere de Mars-like.  Very nice from the start but the flavor was just adequate.  Quite nice from a dying style.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"
2056,"2009-09-07",3.5,"Fresh 750ml bottle.  The pour yields a hazy, golden amber colored body with a small, foamy, off-white head.  A soapy wash leaves few dry spots of lacing behind.  The aroma shows a clean, lightly sweet grain bill with hints of light orchard fruit, bitter flowers, fresh grass, and minerals.  Theres an overtone of young brett that imparts a bit of welcomed farmhouse mustiness.  Flavors follow suit, sweet up front from the grainy malt, transitioning to a semi-dry, peppery, grassy hop finish.  The brett is very mild, offering just a hint of wild farmhouse character.  Medium bodied, the palate sports a fine, lively carbonation that cuts through the initial sweetness and delivers the dry finish.  Solid, sessionable brew that borders on wild ale.  Some additional age might funk it up a bit more.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
2056,"2009-09-05",3.4,"Bottle... Lightly hazed yellow ale with a small, fizzy, white head. Decent retention. The funky, earthy aroma lends notes of apple, wood and lactic acidic. Medium-bodied with laid-back carbonation. The tart, fruity flavor puts forward apricot, wood, lactic acid, apple and gentle hop bitterness. Finishes lightly crisp, minerally and a touch tangy.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2056,"2009-08-01",3.6,"This one has been hiding in the back for some time but not for any other reason than it got buried behind a couple of things. Cloudy light yellow color. Aroma is a tad citrusy with some earthiness to it and wild yeast. Flavor is medium bodied with a nice wheat malt backbone and a spice and banana tang. There is a bit of funkiness hiding in the background. At first I thought it was the palate bruiser I had before this but after reading a couple of these reviews it looks like this is more funky than I was expecting. There is some detritus here so be careful if you dont need any extra vitamin B.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
2056,"2009-07-16",3.7,"750ml bottle courtesy of xmarcnolanx  thanks Marc!  Pours a hazy light gold with a one fnger stark white head that faded into a thin layer almost immediately.  The nose is light citrus, mild vinegar and faint funk.  The taste is light funk, aspirin, light vinegar and lemon peel.  Medium, lightly prickly mouthfeel.  Decent Biere de Mars  refreshing summer brew - thanks again Marc.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","Sparky"
2056,"2009-05-12",3.8,"Hazy gold pour.  Big thick fluffy head and spotty lace.  Suspended yeast proteins all over.   Earthiness, apple, and yeast on the nose.   Floral notes, yeast, and light hops.  Slightly dry finish.","raleigh, North Carolina, USA","ucusty"
2056,"2009-05-05",3.8,"750ml from Sams, Durham. Pale orange body, and the vigorous pour leaves a sizable head and a buncha floaties. The nose is initially soft fruits like pear and apple, with some mild spice. But it soon reveals some delicious funk, something thats more than a little present in the flavors. Nothing especially barnyard-y, but more like DeProefs yeast strain in this nicely mild beer. Rustic and dry, with only moderate sweetness, and thats just fine with me. Pretty good beer, docked just a tick because of the steep price.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
2056,"2009-04-05",4.2,"750 mL bottle. Pours cloudy gold with a very attractive stand of off-white head. The aroma is quite floral with some earth and tangerine notes, a mellow brett edge, some light honey sweetness, a hint of sea salt, and distant grassy hops. The flavor is quite fruity at first. Tangerine, mango, lemon, apple, a hint of banana, and even a bit of cherry stand out in front. A bit of honeyish malt lies below that. Following the fruitiness come several floral notes-- lavender, hibiscus, rose. Then comes the real treat. An earthy, slightly tart, but not at all overwhelming brettanomyces taste takes the forefront as the sip approaches its finish. Nice, dry hay and leather notes take over by the time I swallow. The aftertaste is earth, tangerine peels, and super dry white wine. I’m especially impressed with the balance in this one. The bretty character is exactly enough to cut the fruitiness without masking it. Great beer, I wish I had more of it.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"
2056,"2009-03-30",3.7,"Bottle shared by Vferg, thanks dudy.  Pours a hazy golden body with a white head.  Dry earthy notes of brett, wood, floral notes, grain and some citrus but more like a weizen in terms of the fruit character.  Finishes with spicy apple bitterness.  Good brew, reminds me of ithaca brute.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
2056,"2009-02-24",3.9,"Bottle from Wine Specialist. Hazy golden color with a decently fluffy white head. Aromas of light orange over mild barnyard. Medium body with mild carbonation. Seems mostly Brett for flavor. Small hints of citrus, wood, yeast, but they are subordinate. Its a very smooth ale. Develops fruity notes. Finishes both astringent and dry. Barring the above its almost fruit juicy. Good ale.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
2056,"2009-02-23",4.0,"Bottle.  Pours clear dark yellow with a small, fizzy, white head, somewhat lasting with good lacing.  Aroma is heavy malt (grain, hay, straw), light hops (flowers), heavy yeast (horse blanket, barnyard, musty) with notes of bubble gum and medicine (yeah Brett!).  Light bodied, thin texture, soft carbonation, and a chalky finish.  Average duration, light sweetness, acidity, and bitterness.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
2056,"2009-01-30",4.1,"Another slow gusher, but again it does not seem to be excessively carbonated.  A careful pour nets me a one-finger thick, pale, off-white colored head in my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip.  The beer is a light honey color that shows a brilliantly clear, bright, full gold color when held up to the light.  Ahh, the aroma is quite nice; it is a mix of hoppy herbal notes ( lemon grass, orange zest, blossoming wild flowers), interesting pale malt aromatics (honey-like malt and cracker like grain) and a backdrop of soft funkiness that reminds me of musty - slight moldy cellars, a touch of barnyard musk and some cured leather phenolics towards the end.  The deeper I breath in of the aroma the more focused the Brettanomyces funk gets.  The aroma is just fantastic and all that I had hoped for in this beer.

Dry and effervescent the beer foams up as it hits my tongue.  The carbonation provides both a peppery carbonic bite as well as a touch of carbonic acidity.  This has a solid hop bitterness to it as well as a solid herbal hop component and a lemon grass notes; this last would likely be accentuated more if the beer wasnt so dry, but I like the beer dry.  Grassy notes of hay mix with more herbal notes that remind me a bit of aromatic, spicy weeds (arugula, milk weed and nettle come to mind).  The finish dries out even more because of a musky, phenolic Brettanomyces presence that seems to lurk in waiting and blooms after the beer has left the mouth (though it never becomes anything more than subtle).  This beer is eminently quaffable, it is so light, so effervescent, so quenching; the light body just works perfectly with the flavors found in this beer.  There is not a hint of oxidation to this brew, unlike the Ambrée that I had last night.

The second pour of this brew (which ends up quite hazy by the way) has me noticing the fantastic aroma again; it really is an amazing mix of hops, pale malt and soft Brett.  Quite a bit more notes of aromatic orange zest start to come out in the flavor as this beer warms up.  Also it becomes a bit more apparent that there is a light tartness to this beer, it is nothing over the top, but provides a nice note to this beer and it helps to accentuate the refreshing quality of this beer.  This beer is way too easy to drink, I could quaff liters of this on a warm day as my 750ml bottle of this disappears quite a bit quicker than I was expecting / hoping.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2056,"2009-01-02",3.0,"(750ml bottle)  Pours a clear amber body with a spare white head.  Aroma of cinnamon, apple, horse blanket, florals, dust, and citrus.  Flavor of apple, yeast, some tangerine, lightly toasted grain, and caramel with low carbonation and a watery mouthfeel.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
2056,"2009-01-02",4.1,"Beaming yellow-gold. Voluminous white froth slowly diminishes into a thin cap. Charming brett-derived aromas of Band-Aid and peach permeate the nostrils.  Quite lively with a mix of airy and perfumey phenols. Brightly floral with hops which are enhanced by softer notes of straw. Loose bubbly prickles of carbonation. Delicately flavored with a rounded peach and honeydew melon tartness which is swiftly followed by a brett-induced phenolic snap. Wonderfully restrained, yet vivid at the same time, Pils malt generates a lemon cake effect as it unites with the fruity esters. Explosive hoppiness supports the core with ample juiciness before gently cleansing the tongue and stimulating the appetite with a coarse herbal bitterness. Malt gradually intensifies to lend a mild toastiness as well as a crackery aspect. Finishes extravagantly hoppy yet balanced with a captivating medley of fresh flowers, pilowy malt, Band-Aid, and peppery and fruity esters. A glorious creation, with just as much class as rusticity.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2056,"2008-12-26",4.0,"Creamy white layer of foam over a light orange body.  Intricate nose details notes of brett, farmhouse and hop.  Thin body, watery texture.
