Smak mocno wytrawny, lekko kwaśny, delikatna słodycz praktycznie tylko nadaje piwu kremowości i gładkiej faktury. Ciało nie jest za duże, ale to też przyczyną głębokiego odfermentowania. W smaku też ogrom się dzieje; jest bardzo winnie, są też dojrzałe wiśnie, dużo drewna, mokrej skóry, nuta karmelu. Posmak bardzo wytrawny, taniczny, winny, długi i interesujący.

The pour is a darker brown color with a couple shreds of ruby coming through. There is a thicker egg shell colored head that falls to a thick ring and film leaving a few spots of lace. The aroma is really winey. There is a strong grape fruitiness and a good wine barrel character to it that Im not crazy about. Its decently crisp and clean but there is a bright wine character. The flavor isnt as good. Its more wine forward with a heavy grape and a strong barrel character. This isnt really my jam. The mouth feel is crisp and clean and carries a good bit of carbonation and a lingeringly wine barrel and hint of grape on the back end.

3390,"2014-09-21",3.9,"Bottle shared by a kind soul in a location remote of my dining room. 

The beer pours a hazy red with a good head and some lacing on the glass.

The aroma is sour cherries, oak, tart fruit, and mild vinegar. Its got almost a soft nose, its not that its not aromatic, but nothing is especially pronounced either. 

The flavor is nicely sour & plenty woody. Its got some light booze but it most defiantly does not come off as a 13%er Its got plenty of tart most especially cherries and pears. Its rich without being awfully sweet. 

Certainly something Ive wanted to try for a long time, and like with many things of this nature Im sure there are bottles/years that would just blow the mind, this shows the potential to do that, and while being extraordinarily enjoyable it wasnt quite there for me in that mind blowing capacity.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

3390,"2014-09-12",4.2,"Oak aged version of Oerbier, made for the first time in 2002 and at that time the strongest Belgian beer along with Dubuissons Bush Prestige (but surpassed since then by some Alvinne and Struise brews). Yellowish white, irregular, dense, very stable head (certainly with respect to the alcohol strength), ruby bronze colour, almost clear. Very powerful, unusual, oud-bruin like and vinous aroma of candied cherries, yoghurt, orange liqueur, oak, old sherry, cognac, red wine, dates, Belgian chocolates and apple sauce. Fruity sweetish taste, honeyish, fresh spiciness, soft and deep dark malts with sour component strongly reminiscent of an oud bruin; very vinous mouthfeel from beginning to finish, complex with lots of warming, port-like alcohol, which graciously manages to remain elegant, sweet and agreeable, no sign of astringency despite the ABV. This is a very appetizing, complex, vinous and fascinating ale, almost a mix of oud bruin, barley wine and quadrupel. I recommend collecting each vintage and comparing them since the barrels on which each vintage is aged, tend to differ (so deserve separate entries here!). The first version was not as sourish as later versions, the 2006 version seemed dryer with more tannins and the 2008 version seemed more soft and rounded, with a tad more roasted bitterness. Collectors item and ideal for ageing in the cellar - too bad this brewery doesnt use 75 cl bottles. Since there is only one entry for Oerbier Special Reserva, my scoring here is an average of all the vintages I tasted so far.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Slick, almost thick mouth feel... Very nice beer that has withstood the test of time. Overall, the booze shines through a little too much given the style, in my opinion, but its still a very well crafted ale.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

Very nice. Flavor is a big punch of sourness that is a combo between tart cherries and big rich black cherries, vanilla, a punch of very drying oak.

3390,"2014-01-01",4.1,"My 500th recorded rating for New Years Eve, making this my last beer of 2013 and the first of 2014. Feel like I made a good choice with this one.  
330 ml bottle, 2006 vintage. Appearance: Beautiful, clear dark mahogany brown with slight red hue. Light brown head that flourishes before dissipating to a ring. Aroma: Sweet, cherries; plums, figs; some vinegar, oak. Almost dont even want to drink this, it smells delicious. Taste: Despite the sweetness to the nose, the taste is restrained. Mildly sweet up front, balanced by a pleasant tartness that follows, finishing dry. Some oxidation, musty basement, and maybe even a bit of cheese in there, but in a nice way -- this is 7 (now 8?) years young. Alcohol well-masked in taste -- its only after several sips that my body registers how big this is. I want to say something about it being tannic, but I still dont know how to use that descriptor right -- if I did, I expect I could collapse a few of the above sentences into a single word. Vinous and woody, with cherries galore. Rather nice. Palate: Full body, slick, mouth-coating texture, soft, fine-bubbled carbonation. Overall: One of these days Ill track down a fresh bottle and give it a whirl. This is a delight, and Im glad I chose it for tonight.
  
I first started rating beers here because I wanted to better appreciate what I was drinking. I figured the best way to do that would be to concentrate, follow some guidelines, and be forced to write things down. In the last year, I think Ive at times rated more out of habit, or scorekeeping (#40 on the list of users from WA -- yeah!). I get lazy about it, jot down a few words, and sometimes feel like Im stagnating (desipte the growing number of ticks) instead of growing. Id like to return to my original approach in the coming year, rating fewer beers but being more thoughtful about those I do rate. I wonder how long this particular ""resolution"" is going to last? At any rate, glad to be part of the RB community, and look forward to drinking with you folks in 2014.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

The beer is pretty clear, and appears a light brown hue. The tan head is thin and wispy, fading rapidly after pouring. The aroma is definitely of a Flanders our bruin. Oak, sour cherries, malt, alcohol. The flavor is really enjoyable. Great balance and the subtle nuances are showcased well. Sour cherries, oak, and nary a trace of alcohol. Not sure where the 13% abv is hidden, but it is masked exceptionally well. Overall, a really tasty beer. Recommended.

3390,"2012-10-08",4.2,"Poured from a 2010 vintage bottle into a brandy snifter. Appearance is a dark, translucent brown with a nice beige head of foam. Had I realized the alcohol content, I probably would not have expected that. The aroma is very malty and leathery with some definitive tartness aspects to it. The taste is more of the malty sweetness, but it has a muted tartness to it that just makes the beer very interesting and fun to drink. It is a very good beer that manages to pull the alcohol content off without any effort. No burn at all.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
3390,"2012-10-07",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 17, 2012 Bottle (330 ml) 2002. Huge thanks to David for sharing this beer! Hazy and thick dark amber with almost no head (as expected for a 10 years old beer) and some lacing. Aroma is incredibly complex with red wine, wood, apple, caramel, cherry and spices. Oxidation is barely perceptible. Taste is also really complex with wood, red wine, apple, caramel and spices. Theres an important acidic presence (a good one) that made this beer unique and its hiding the oxidation (which is still more perceptible in taste than in aroma). Mouthfeel is vinous, almost sirupy. Alcohol is warming, but when you realize the beer is 12% abv, you also realize that alcohol is pretty well hidden. This is really an amazing beer! Wonderfully complex and near perfect balance between acidity and big malty body. I would be curious to taste a younger version of this one. Merci David!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

3390,"2012-08-22",4.1,"Poured into a tulip. Big thanks to SteveFinny for this. A 13% oud bruin, wtf?

4.5 A: Hazed deep plum color. Two fingers of frothy/pillowy beige head. Retention is very good, especially for the ABV and a big ring of lacing is left.

4.5 S: Huge cherry aroma. Tart and lightly acetic. Sweet, yet funky. Apple orchard, oak, vanilla, and berries. Im amazed at how well this is hiding the booze. That in itself is a feat. This is fairly simple for the style, but it smells so good that I cant deny it a stellar score.

4.5 T: Like this nose, this has a big intensity and the flavors mesh so well. Cherries and berries are the highlight. So much flavor that its like Im drinking a cherry cider or something. Moderate tartness and again, lightly acetic. Vanilla and oak next. The funk comes out to play offering rotting wood, apple orchard, wet grass, and some mustiness. The booze is more apparent in the taste, but its still well hidden. A bit of tannins from the barrel. Very good.

4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation, which is lightly spritzy and a bit stingy. Not particularly creamy, but it works and works well.

4.0 D: Very tasty beer. I cant believe Im drinking an oud bruin this big. The flavors sure reflect that. Well done.

Quite the complex little thing this one. The first thing hitting the good old buds is a berry sourness often found in gooseberries, cherries and red currants. Then it goes all candy-sweet and fruity before it ends light yeasty and woody-tart with tones of vinious oak. Not at all what I expected! Much more vinious than I ever could have imagined.

3390,"2012-02-03",4.3,"Special Reserva 07 pours a dark murky reddish brown color with a fizzy one finger head.  No lacing and the head died a quick death. 

The smell on this beer just blew me away.  Its rich, deep, and complex.  Its like a mix between a beer and a wine.  Up front is the aroma of ripe cherries.  What comes in next is a beautiful aroma of oak, slight vinegar, and a nice yeasty earthiness.  Im sure as this beer aged a little bit the vinegar like aroma has died down.  Which is fine because what really got me here was the deep oak aroma.  Just awesome.

The taste is also great but not might be as deep or rich as the smell was.  Still great though.  The tartness was just right for me.  Not overwhelming at all.  Not like a fresh version of this brew would be.  The oak is once again the star here.  It just sits on the tongue.  Ripe cherries, leather, and malt round out the taste.  A wonderful mixture.  Like I said above, felt like a mix between a red wine and a beer.  As for the 13% abv.  I never once even thought about it.  It never gets in the way or hits you.

You definitely taste the belgian yeast/dark fruits/sweetness of the Oerbier, but aside from that its very RV-like. Definitely an outstanding brew! Amazing.","Rimini, ITALY","teorn88"

A: Murky, red-brown body. Thin off-white skim. A few stray bubbles left on the sides of the glass.

S: Cherries, caramel, leather, lactic tartness, raisins, and red wine.

T: Tart cherries, sweet caramel malts, a nice tartness, and a fine madeira-like quality. Mild oxidation has treated this beer well.

3390,"2012-01-09",4.1,"Bottle, 2010, brought back by a friend from Brussels :)
Faint nose. Sweet and sour smell (foretelling the taste I imagine) smelling attractive like sweet fruit candy our dried fruits but sometimes I get a mental image of a pool of urine in a damp back-alley leading to an estaminet (which slightly has a similar olfactory profile... sour & sweet... woody... etc).
Tastes like a Flemish Red. I dont have much experience with that style but first that comes to mind is Rodenbach, though this is much easier to attack, for the unaccustomed. First impression is that the taste reminds me of a weird mix of cider and barley wine. The initial taste on the tongue of the former and the complexity of the latter. I prefer that second part of the taste ""experience"" if you will, so I like the after taste left on the palate which has that complexity and barley wine-ness.
Not used to it, admittedly, but a nice refresher in Flemish Red (again, thats what it seems like to this beginner in the style...). Recommended as an all-around well crafted beer and to surprise friends with something quite different.","Quebec, CANADA","jcnesci"

3390,"2011-12-10",3.7,"2002 Bottle. Big thanks to FooFaa for opening this one up at the Mad-Murren event at Als of Hampden. Poured into a tasting glass.
A - Pours dark amber with a light film of white head leaving no lacing down the glass at all. A bit under-welming to say the least.
S - Tart cherries dominate from first sip to the last. As it begins to warm, more and more caramel malts come thru. Quite a bit of tartness but it still maintains a very nice balance.
T - Lots of tart cherries up front carry thru the entire glass. They blend very nicely with the rich caramel malt sweetness. Finish is a delicious balance of tart cherries and sweetness. A nearly flawless balance of sweet and sour. One of the best dark ales I have ever had.
M - Medium-Heavy body and flavor with moderately low carbonation. Quite the tart cherrie feel with plenty of lingering tart/malt flavors in the finish.
D - Fairly high. I am not the biggest fan of this style but I still really liked the flavors in this one. I just cant see myself drinking more than one of these at a time as the flavors dominate","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

Kinda spicy and yeasty components too. Some of the bread crust malts in there as well, but the oak dominates the taste a lot.

 2010 vintage re-rate  Consumed rather fresh. Amazing reddish chestnut brown with a small slightly off white head. The aroma is really stunning: first off loads of ripe dark grapes, very clear black currant component, Pinot Noir qualities and even notes of English wine gums. Underlying oak notes. Amazingly vineous. Marvelous. Reminds me a lot of the aroma os De Struise Aardnon. The taste is beautifully vineous, too. But its more of a dark fruit rather than these fresh grapes and currants - it also has those, but strives towards figs. A slightly spicy yeast, combined with some Chardonnay-like refreshing tastes and a lightly tart edge from the barrel all adds up to brilliance. There is a slight astringency in the after taste, which holds it back for me to go 4.4-4.5, but the overall impression is exceptional.

3390,"2011-04-26",4.8,"11.2 oz. brown bottle thanks to rudolf. 2009. A reddish amber beer with a nice head in a tulip. The aroma is simply wonderful. I was not expecting this. Fruity, floral almost like roses and has a nice sourness like lemons. It smells like there is Brett in here. The taste is tart, lemony and a fizzy mouthfeel that prickles the tongue. The yeast seems to add its own bitterness. The one thing that sticks out is the hidden 13% ABV. This is dangerously smooth. I really want to know if there is ""wild yeasts"" in here cause it seems like it. I always here people say that a certain beer blew them away. That rarely happens to me. Well this beer did that. Ultra smooth, dangerously drinkable, lots of complex flavors going on, perfect sourness. This is a special beer and now the hunt is on for me to acquire as many as I can.

3390,"2011-04-24",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2012 Bottle picked up at Capones a few months back. Thanks to Matt, as always. Served in my trusty Cantillon tulip.

Pours a murky mahogany with a good off-white head. Forms up and is pretty bubbly at about 1.5 fingers. After that, it dies down and leaves a nice cap and a lot of lacing on the edges of the glass. The nose has some notes of bright sherry and semi-tart cherry. Mild acidity is present in the nose. Its showing some signs of oxidation, though mostly in a good way. The flavor lives up to the nose. Not too much complexity, but the light acetic touch balances the cherry and light malt notes very well. The sherry in the background is quite pleasant. Mouthfeel is medium and quite creamy. Low carbonation and not hint whatsoever that this is 13%. Holy crap, I cant believe that after looking up. Good job, De Dolle.

It pours an amazing translucent red, deep and crimson. The head is frothy and off-white with some great lacing.

The smell is amazing. It is full-on with some surprising hops but mainly a rich, sweet fruit decadence. There is a ton of pineapple and citrus with some maraschino cherry.

The flavor is utter dominance. It is sour, but not mouth-puckering. This one defies logic though. At 13% it isnt sweet at all, it is sour, but not over powering, and above all there is no hinting of alcohol what-so-ever. It has apricots, apples, cherries, raspberries, and pears. IT is a fruity, rich, malty, but tart and sour beast.

Just a beast.

Note: This is a re-rate. For those concerned, the original rating is below this one. I guess back than I was completely taken aghast by the sourness of this brew, something that was not anticipated. 
Clear red to rust brown beer, creamy light beige head, pretty stable, non adhesive. Aroma: sour Rodenbach to even bretta aroma, maraschino cherries, milk chocolate, for those who know it: ""Mon Cherie"" candy. MF: soft carbon, full body. Taste: pretty sour start, red currants, tobacco, sour cherries, lots of spiced, through all this flavour violence,  the alcohol comes through warming and sweetening things up quite a bit, turning into something almost vinous, red wine. Aftertaste: still holds the sour bretta touch, but also some caramel and a certain woody dry bitterness. Not bad, not bad at all! Pretty funny that apparently I referred to Rodenbach in both ratings, which I otherwise rarely do.

Aroma:  The nose is big and bold with lots of dried fruit, dates, spices, and sweet malts.  Absolutely delightful and a good portent of things to come. 
Appearance: It pours a very dark brown with a slight haze and ruddiness.  You cant see through it.  The head starts off large and tan with lots of effervescence but fades quickly to a thin tan ring around the edge of glass.  Certainly not too bad for something at 13% ABV.
Taste: Surprisingly light and fruity on the tongue with a nice touch of tartness.  The dark fruits are there but along with some cranberry as well.  The alcohol is very well hidden until it hits the back of your throat.  Then it provides a nice warming sensation all the way down.
Palate: Light to medium body with an abundance of carbonation leading to a short to medium, tart berry finish.  This one borders on some fine wine flavors in the finish as well.

A - Very dark reddish brown color with a slightly smaller than average foamy off white head that reduces fast and leaves a nice thin layer of lacing.

S - Strong aroma of tart cherry and balsamic and red wine vinegar, with the emphasis on the wine vinegar smell. Has some gueuze like aroma. Acidic aroma is the strongest, but it isnt overpowering.

T - A lot of grape, apple cherry flavor with tart being the main aspect of the fruit, but it isnt extraordinarily tart (especially given the style). Like the aroma, red wine vinegar provides a fair amount of the taste. Some tannic taste and somewhat like a sweet red wine. Fairly vinous and the ABV is well hidden.

M - Medium body with a bit above average carbonation. Somewhat tingly and a drying finish.

D - Good balance between tart/acidic and sweet, especially given the style. Very enjoyable taste and the ABV is very well hidden. Quite easy to drink.

Its like taking a bowl of sweet overripe cherries and mixing them with tart sour cherries, throwing them in a barrel, and letting all of those flavors meld together into a beautiful soiree of elegance.

This beer is an assault on the senses. I dont particularly like sour or funky beers, but this beer is sour and funky and I love it.  Unfortunately, I bought this beer at the Charleston Beer Exchange (great store and great people) and have to figure out how to procure more without driving 850 miles.","New York, USA","southamptonsam"
3390,"2010-01-05",3.4,"2008 version. Glinting-to-muddy chestnut under a fine creamy collar- in the requisite stemmed Oerbier bowl, naturally. Immediate tang of lactic and champagne-like acidity on the nose; plenty of barrel, balsamic touches, slight cheese, vomit, leaves and dampness leaning into Flemish sour territory. Spritzier and more straightforward than anticipated; gentle warming dried fruit and nougat peeping out from behind the dank barrels, blackcurrant, champagne, iron-like glow. Light and prickling; no burn or heat, but quite a bit of fizz. Touch of ash in the aftertaste. Incredibly mellow at the declared ABV, but feels a bit empty like it needs some time in the bottle to lose the spritz and develop some genuine magic. Rodenbach with a tablespoon of Drie Fonteinen and champagne dribbled in it. Maybe one to come back to...","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"

Theres notes of cherry, damp oak, caramel, molasses, cardamom, cinnamon and a nice dry brett funk.  The flavor is also nicely complex with rich undertones of molasses, tobacco, and caramel that play nicely off tart cherries, tannins, red grapes, and spice.  It rounds out in the finish with a nice dry sour funk and oak.  The body is a little disappointing.  Its light, a bit thin and heavily carbonated.

3390,"2009-10-30",3.9,"330 ml bottle courtesy of an extra from Beerlando a while back. 2007 Edition. Pours a deep dark murky brownish red, some amber glowing edges, a nice beige head, decent, dies to a smaller layer, a little lacing, pretty well carbonated. Aromas are a bit boozy, red wine tannins, sweet and sour cherry combination, grapes, oaky vanilla and wet wood are lighter. Fruity, yet decent wine feel, dry. Initial is a bit tart on the tounge, as sour and sweet cherries, red wine tannins, rich fruitiness, decent bitterness, decent alcohol warmth permeate. A decent maltiness comes through, but the beer stays tart and cherry fruity, leaving a decent tartness on the palate, with some sweet caramel and fruity feel to the back end. Oak comes in moreso in the body, light prickliness and wet wood, some decent red wine tannin character, bitter and tart, very interesting. An enjoyable beer, and much different than I expected.

The dark fruit notes provide a sweet balance to the amazing oak wooden presence. Very vinous with faint hints of chocolate malt. Slight vinegar presence, probably coming from the blending of different aged beers.

3390,"2009-07-21",5.0,"UPDATED: MAY 24, 2014 > The masterpiece of Flemish red- untouchable
[ Belgian Bowtie Bottle 2007 Vintage ][ 33cl ][ Trade ][ Reidel Vinum XL Pinot Noir ][ 5/24/14 ]
>> My last 2007 bottle from the cellar, Belgian label with bowtie, not the US export label. Procured in a trade on BA. Pours with medium carbonation, great head formation. Crystal clear dark amber looking maroon in the glass. Yellow cream foam with ridiculous lacing. Nose is manure, farmy, wet hay, cranberry, marionberry, rhubarb pie left out in the windowsill. This one has depth- not every note is out in the open. You have to dig deep, but then you dont need to dig at all. Just relax. Taste is bright and citric, a powerful flash of what seems to be salty and spicy but then quickly dissipates to something lactic and juicy, like a shot of cranberry lime mixer. Mid palate is leathery with big cranberry piling on with notes of dark chocolate covered cranberries, dried berries,  and balancing french oak tannins. Dry but not papery. This beer is always stellar and this one is no different. Perfect really. Its just silly that this 13% as it drinks like it was 7%. Its quenching and juicy, really a great Fall beer with so much color, mild barrel tannin, inky Cabernet flavors of baked berry and chocolate. Ive always wanted to score this a 5.0, and I think after 6-7 good sit downs with this beer it deserves it. This is the best on earth for Flemish red, the absolute masterpiece. Now I just need more bottles :(


330mL 2007 ed thanks to ryan. Muddy brune pour. Rich, creamy tan head for a full sour. Insane nose as always with savory meat, red wine, sweet aged balsamic, toffee, caramel, holiday spice, porcini mushroom, funky/dusty attic. Rich, dark, funky with a sweet and sour play. Quintessential Flemish red nose. The archetype. Taste has tang, lime sour, lactic sour, red wine oaky spice, sweet balsamic, key lime pie. So rich, quenching, lactic. Light and refreshing to drink with heavy complexities. One of my favorite beers at the ultimate vintage. Nothing beats 2007 Oerbier Reserva for dark sours. 11/24/2012 9/5/10/5/19=4.8330 mL 2007 ed into Orval trappist. Aroma is very sour (I cant believe this doesnt count as a sour ale): lots of sour cherries, raspberries, strawberries with merlot, oak. Appearance is perfect: cloudy, deep mahogany with a one finger, creamy, tan head that leaves big sticky lacework. Taste is similar to a Flemish red upfront with very sour light fruits and powerful, citric tartness but with a creamy, milk chocolate background along with sourdough malt. Long, sour finish. 13% is completely hidden. This is excellent. 7/21/2009 9/5/9/4/17=4.4330mL 2006 ed. Pours similarly excellent deep brune with a towering, tan, bubbly head that has excellent retention and fair lace. Aroma is similarly excellent with oak, vinous qualities, grape skin, lactic funkiness. Taste though has more of the Oerbier strange qualities like tamarind, must, dusty yeast. It is less sour and more like an unintentionally infected batch of double gravity Oerbier. Still good, but not superlative. 6/21/2010 9/4/8/4/15=4.0330mL 2006 ed. Aroma is completely amazing: red wine reduction, sherry, black cherries, spicy oak, hot balsamic, slight kriek funkiness. All very soft and muted. Taste up front is dry, fairly prominent carbonation, sweet Belgian strong ale dark fruits and bready spices with a quenching, lactic palate with a hint of acidic lemon. Really impressive. Not quite at the fresh 2007 level, but excellent. 10/15/2010 9/4/8/4/16=4.1    FULL VERTICAL TASTING 2/12/20112002: Not really a sour or even tart. There is butter, some sharp lemon, sweet tarts in the nose. Taste is watery and lacking character.2005: More lemon/lime heavy, sharper. Taste is richly lactic with cinnamon and vinous oakiness.2006: Butter, flank steak, bourbon, and raspberry jam come through in the nose. Taste is sharp, sour, muted, tannic, tart. Really excellent aroma and great body. Very nice!2007: Definitely the most funky and sour in the nose. Flank steak, fatty meat, and lime palomilla in addition to sharp red wine, Flemish red complexities. Taste is unreal: hugely tannic, mineral forward, lots of red wine oak. No acetic acid. Definitely the best of the series with palate perfection: cinnamon, butter, spice, lemon and citrus. Very similar to Struise Earthmonk is idea but so different in execution. This is softer, easier to love and much more consistent than Earthmonk. 2007 Oerbier Reserva is certainly in the running to be my favorite beer in existence. 2008: Heavy, more vinous, more tannic, really just over the top tannic like oversteeped tea. Tart but not sour. Meh.2009: Pours the best aesthetically with the best head. Fresh lemon and berry aroma. Taste is tannic, oddly salty, big tart berries. Decent.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

7/10/2009:  De Dolle Oerbier Special Reserva 2004 has an amazing sweet-sour cherry aroma.  It also exhibits pear, brown sugar, sourdough, and apples.  This beer is brown and color with ruby hues and is nearly opaque.  It retains a creamy off-white head throughout.  Wow, the flavor is almost as good as the aroma, but not as sweet.  The front showcases caramel-covered green apples and sour cherry while the middle presents itself as slightly more dry with a crisp sourness that makes the think of crabapples or maybe unsweeted cranberries.  There is also some caramel sweetness and just a tinge of oxidation sneaking in right at the very end of the finish.  The alcohol content is completely invisible.  As it warms, cedar and just a hint of almond becomes evident.  This beer has a medium body, but enough carbonation to keep in feeling light on the palate and also aids in helping the aroma and flavor explode.  I really like the play of sweet, tart, sour, and dry in this beer.  The cherry and cedar characteristics are quite prominent and pair nicely.  This is truly an excellent beer!

Pours a muddy brown hue with nice red highlights and with two fingers of loud fizzy foam.  Aroma of rather tart fruit (cherry, raspberry, and not-quite-ripe strawberry), oak, red wine, and light caramel.  Flavor has some tart fruit (not as sour as the nose would have you believe), more dry woodiness, raspberry vinaigrette...then moves toward some added complexity nearer the finish -- caramel sweetness (nicely balances the initial tartness) and some roasted malt tones.  Nicely complex in both aroma and flavor.  Quite dry with almost red wine-like tannins.  The huge ABV is extremely well hidden and all in all the body is on the lighter side for such a big brew.

Murky brown, a thin head lingers film-like while scattered bubbles pepper the sides. Raising my glass, I am struck by an orchestra of tartness, wood, oak, leather, nutmeg, all-spice, and rye bread. Going back for more, I savor her tart nature which pervades all aspects of her nose, and hopefully her palate. A thin body carries an explosion of mouth-drying tartness which sends shivers of ecstasy all the way down to my pinky toe. Mouth-puckering cherries, cranberries, and plums with brown spices sprinkled atop crunchy pears and star fruit. Each quaff is clean and drying, with a supple essence of leather and wood. More tart berries kiss my lips and dance with my tastebuds in a sensual orchestra of desire. Her clean, tart nature with whispers of barnyard is a sirens song for a sour-ale geek such as me. Our time together is brief, but I shall remember my De Dolle Brouwers Special Reserva 2004 for the rest of my life.


Again, many thanks to my friend and fellow beer geek. Truly, my life is blessed once more, and hopefully someday another De Dolle beer shall grace me with her presence. If you are anybody who enjoys good beer and you come across one of their beers, run, do not walk, to the nearest check-out counter cradling her close to your chest like a suckling babe.

3390,"2009-02-11",3.4,"33cl bottle - cap indicates 2008. Pours a deep, dark, cloudy orange-brown. The tan head isnt very thick, but it almost seems like it should be as the bottle begins to issue forth foam just sitting there. The aroma is rich and vinous with acid (light touches of vinegar), fruit (dark fruit, cherries, sour grape), and hints of dark malts. The flavor follows the aroma: malty on the very tip of the tongue and then quickly sliding into lots of acidity and wine-like fruitiness. At mid-palate, it is very dry, very tart, and very low in sweetness. It has just a touch of malts, toffee, and chocolate and some fruity esters, too. Very funky. The mouthfeel is acidic and briskly carbonated that lends it an odd resemblance to a sparkling red wine - but fuller with beer-like hints of chewy malts. Overall, interesting and tasty, but I think I liked the standard Oerbier much better. Ive had sour beers that Ive really liked, but this just isnt one of my favorites. I think its pretty good, but I cant give it a score that even resembles its average (4.03 at the time of this writing). Its a touch too vinegary.

3390,"2009-01-23",4.5,"Bottle from a little shop in Philadelphia, picked up while walking around the city with Fin, Loz and Traci. Mysteriously opaque rustic orange pour, nice dense tan head. Intensely concentrated dark fruit and marzipan, a distilled sense of noble rot, of aromas decomposing down into their more elemental forms. And yet, there is a hint of the green coming of spring, and the surprise of a breathe of sea air carried far inland. Ethereal lightness on the palate, seemingly too delicate to carry the mad rush of flavors.

In Lewis ""The Silver Chair"", a character talks about how the gems we find in mines are just the dead shells of fruit that grow far, far lower in the living core of the earth, where you can quench your thirst on a glass of freshly squeezed rubies or diamonds. This is what the nectar of a ruby would taste like. So deeply rooted in earth. And yet pulsating with fruit, fruit somehow compressed in time to be both perfectly ripe and bracingly green.

Acidic lemon and cranberry lend a helping hand to the strong, acidic, but not overbearing vinegar. The finish is long, bright, dry, and clean.

Strong oak and fruit dominate the front of the mouth, with a clear red wine element. Then come subtle blackberry and cherry notes accompanied by a solid earthiness. There is some sourness, but only enough to notice, as it blends so well with all the other flavors. The superbly dry finish is earth, bitter chocolate, and alcohol.

Some light candies and chocolates too. The taste was great; a initial smooth and mellow sour woody and tart cherry flavors. The sweet candy and ripe fruits come out later, especially as it warms.

Tart, sour nose echoes the regular Oerbier, also shows a lot of sweet malt and hints of milk chocolate: odd yet delicious combination, especially with warmth. Flavor continues this combo and is creamy with chocolate while simultaneously spicy and resinous, almost pine-like, rainy. Body is large yet spritzy, quite carbonated in fact. This is an odd beer, even more odd than the original Oerbier, and while I enjoy the uniqueness and complexity, the beer seems a sum of parts, especially the slightly contradictory flavor.02/11 - Always nice to look back and see how your opinion changes. 02-09 vertical currently ranks 07, 08, 09, 06, 05, 02.06/11 - 06,07, 09 next to a bunch of other flemish sours. 06 aged and port like now. 09 still young, heavy de dolle yeast. 07 (several bottles over last month) is amazingly integrated with light fruit, enhanced by sparkling acidity, touch of pepper, and oak. worst 07 bottles are currently 4-4.1, best are 4.7 or so.

The cap pops with small burst of foam and the beer pours a beautiful red-brown with a nice head. Strong malty aroma with ample sour vinegar and wood. Lovely and hugely complex flavor, very woody, malt vinegar, tannic red wine, acidic grapefruit juice and pith, incredible depth and complexity of flavor and a finish with mouth-puckering tannins that go on and on and on. Very little evidence in the mouthfeel of the 13%, I would have thought more like 8-9%! Terrific strong, somewhat-sour beer that really comes into its own as it approaches room temperature. 9/4/8/4/17=4.2

Tart cherries at the front, followed by vanilla and nutmeg, a bit of grapefruit, grapes, caramel and just a bit of oak. Taste is tart cherries (brett), balanced with bready, doughy, sweet caramel malts. A bit of tart (unripe) strawberry.

My 3.400th rating!!
Enjoyed at cellar temperature. Pours a striking deep red with a slight haziness. On top sits a fine, frothy yellowish-beige head. Incredible aroma: Apples, strawberries, sherry, caramel, light liquorice, vanilla, coriander, oak, thyme and a doughy character. Low carbonation, wonderful frothy mouthfeel. Flavour is heavy, lots of viniousness, good, fresh strawberries and a definite oaky sourness at the back of my mouth. Damn! It is so easy to drink! The oak really settles in the aftertaste, mixing in some liquorice, warmth, caramel and just a long, lingering, warming tartness. Another Dolle masterpiece.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"

Sour apple, lemon, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, oak, and light bread crumbs.  Interesting brew, tart with a sweeter fruitiness and toffee in the background with a slightly metallic finish.  An interesting experiment for sure.  Well crafted, although personally I would prefer the sourness to be toned down a bit.  It would allow some of the other complexities of this beer to shine.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"

The aroma is full with loads of wild yeast fighting it out creating tartness and sour rotting lemons, notes of wood and faint vanilla. I also get some grapes and cherries too. The taste has a quick pulse of sweetness that quickly fades away leaving behind tartness and mild sourness. It seems the sour rotting fruit grows momentarily before extreme tartness takes over. The tartness finally lets up a bit in the finish as I can get vague fruitiness around the edges. Zero sense of the ABV (was this an NA brew?).","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

The flavor is similar, but more sugars and tart fruit influence, and less port like wine, which was good as far as Im concerned. A woodsy, nutty finish, followed by considerable ABV heat. This reminds me of a strong Sour, especially when ""drawn"" in rather than poured into the mouth.

3390,"2008-06-16",4.0,"2005 Vintage Bottle, courtesy of pantanap. Thanks Kan, you rock man. Dark brown pour with transparent red edges. An initial beige microbubble head builds, then settles to elegant lacing for the remainder of the glass. Very nice aromatics going on; the Bordeaux barrels add a sweet vinous touch to this beer. Aroma is of tart raspberry and light acetic / vinegar tones above the oak wood, which is much restrained. Raisin fruitcake, plum and clove character of regular Oerbier are still there, but with a puckering dry red wine addition. Very good, but I think I like the two equally as much. Still very carbonated for having 3 years on it. No noticeable signs of oxidation, this could be bomb at 5 or 6 years.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"

A frothy, cream-colored head settles slowly to a thin blanket that lingers.  Semi-sticky flares and patches of lacing gradually dry out, holding fast to the glass walls.  The aroma is nothing short of world class.  The vinous scent shows notes of sour cherries, pinot noir, semi-sweet blackberries, funky oak, and a dry, bretty overtone.  Flavors include juicy, sweet-tart cherries, soft red wine aged in old, funky oak barrels, vanilla, and brett.  Finishes semi-dry and tannic.  Medium-plus bodied and moderate to softly carbonated, it even drinks almost like a red wine.  Reminds me of a blend of 2005 Bon Chien with regular Oerbier.  What a fantastic creation.

Notes: I wished so much that this had been better. It took 20 minutes to open due to the overcarbonation and potential yeast problem, then 5 minutes for cleanup, then drinking it was a bit of a chore, like drinking wine. Lots of better ways to spend $7.","Trenton, New Jersey, USA","lemasney"

3390,"2008-05-15",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2008 2006 bottle.  Pours a hazy deep amber brown with a dense one-finger head that shows great retention and lacing.  Initial smell is a blast of sour cherry tartness with a solid underlying malt sweetness.  Also got a whiff of cola and a bit of the oak.  Taste starts with a very temporary malt sweetness that almost immediately gives way to a big sour citrus taste dominated by lemons and oranges.  The finish is big on sour cherries and lingers for a long time.  Mouthfeel is extremely crisp and the 13% ABV is masked extremely well.  Strong carbonation just zips the tongue with the sour tanginess.  As far as sours go (not my favorites), this one is extremely drinkable.  For lovers of sours, this one is highly recommended.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Very pleasant aroma of sour cherries and tart green apples with notes of yeast and alcohol present as well.  The flavor is equally enjoyable with sour cherries and tart green apples.  A bit of sweet malt helps keep this from being excessively sour. The alcohol is extremely well hidden with no trace of it, even as the beer warms.

Taste is very fruity though kind of dry, fairly tart with a peppery, oaky finish.  The longer I drink this the better it becomes.

This is the third time I have typed this fu@#king review! If my computer messes up again I might destroy it. 

Poured into a tulip, this beer is a clear amber. Almost an inch of head sits atop. The nose is of tart berries and oak. 

This tastes great! The sharp tartness that dominated the regular Oerbier has been muzzled, perhaps by the oak. The sour apples and berries, the yeast, and the oak are seemlessly woven together. This beer is huge. 

The mouthfeel is top-notch. It is full bodied, but not coating like the regular Oerbier. Although there is still a blanket of foam on the beer, the carbonation is very soft. This beer is ready to drink now, but I wonder what some age will do to it.

3390,"2008-01-19",4.4,"Bottled, 2006 vintage. A cloudy dark amber beer with a good and near creamy light brown head. The aroma has a lovely sourness and notes of wood, fruits (cherry, plum) and wine. The flavor has medium sourness and maltiness, with some light hops. You can find notes of sour cherry, wood and a vinous sensation. The alcohol is exremely and I repeat extremely well hidden. Only medium body, lively carbonation, quite long dry aftertaste that is medium tart and fruity. Incredibly complex beer and unbelievable this is 13% ABV. A great beer.","Firenze, ITALY","Slayer85"

3390,"2008-01-10",4.5,"2 reviews in one - small vertical of 2005 and 2006 vintages:  2006 was first - almost a kriek like sour fruit aroma - a bit funky and adventerous.  some notes of candy sugar.  color was a medium and very cloudy goldish brown.  very full body, medium tart - no where near a sour or dry lambic, but did have a very pleasing pucker to it.  some flavors of cherries throughout.  finished surprisingly crisp and clean.  one taster commented ""a multi-layer funked edge"".


2005 vintage - much darker pour than the 06.  flavors were more integrated - less tart, less fruity, but it still managed to be equally complex - just a bit more subtle.  Overall, I enjoyed the 06 a bit more, but both are very, very good beers from De Dolle.","Oreland, Pennsylvania, USA","chronictonic"
3390,"2008-01-06",3.7,"2006 vintage courtesy of Brock_Landers. Wasnt wowed by this beer, and reading some of the other reviews, I guess I should have sat on this one for a while. Still, a very nice brew for the style. Its got kind of a funkhouse aroma to it, hinting of the sour notes that are sure to come (and which do not disappoint). I have to say that I love a lot of bordeaux wines, but I find their impression on this beer to be somewhat misplaced. The wine tannins contribute to the sourness of the beer, but the sour tannins of Bordeaux are the very things I try to overlook when tasting it. Anyway, good for the style, but I didnt fall out of my seat.","Westborough, Massachusetts, USA","MatchesForHire"
3390,"2008-01-05",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 22, 2009 Aroma is slightly funky, clean, and tannic wine characteristics.  
Taste is very wine-like in the dull, red grape and oak barrel taste.  Slightly bitter and dull finish.  
Starts funky and slightly sour, but quickly packs on the alcohol heat and funky fruitiness.  The barrel aging is definitely present, as is a grape-influenced fruitiness.  Finishes in a typically belgian yeasty, slightly hay and bitter fashion.  
Kind of strange.  I like it, but it has some ""flaws"".

3390,"2007-12-31",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2008 Three vintages sampled side-by-side on New Years Eve 2007. Most notably - as well as immediately evident - is the fact that the 2006 vintage that was released 6 months prior to sampling has yet to reach complex heights of development. This will surely change and is just one more of the many profound reasons to revisit all of these at multiple later dates. 
2004. 10/5/10/5/19

Pours heavily clouded deep orange with murky rust and wood tones. A mid-sized, creamy light beige head slowly recedes, never fully. Wispy arc lacing, minor. Brettanomyces is a sub-particle of a candied shell that is so relentless in its continual development that proper critical assessment would be a truly monumental feat. Highly sweet caramel and linear shoots of barnyard funk merge and correlate with bold and heavy leather. Candi sugar-soaked fruits laced with hallugenogenic alcohols swirl wildly out of control. Red wine with requisite tannic spice tickles cilia while vanilla oak notes play the role of immovable backbone and nuance separator. A truly phenomenal break from the ordinary. Brett tartness is full bore and as refreshing as can be while still retaining a funkiness that never seems anything less than novel when this brewery struts its stuff. Sweetness is high but not overdone, vinous flux is minimal as tannic grape and barrel fold into each sip with ease. Acidity is medium but stifled by a refreshing astringency and spice from tannins. Sourness is moderate and wavering. The finish is slowly drying, ultimately extremely dry, very winelike and moderately tart and funky. The mouthfeel has medium-high carbonation and is a silken joy to swirl around an eager tongue.



2005. 9/4/8/4/17

Pours a murky mahogany with crimson and blood-red/violet outlying hues. A small off-white head slowly diminishes, nearly fully, to wisps. Dotted sheet lacing, sparse and thin. Heavy funkiness and lively and acid-brimming tartness from Brettanomyces leads the propulsion of intensity from the most vivid and focused of the three vintages. Sweet port notes are syrupy, full and intelligently wrought. Earthiness is strong but creates a relaxing backdrop. Alcohol is moderate and well-integrated. Earhiness is substantial and never lets up, Brettanomyces and tartness downgraded to a mild to medium level. Barnyard funkiness and traces of characteristics of open fermentation and the transfer of the angels share are evident in retrained quantities. Sweetness is medium and when combined with a moderate acidity and low astringency leads to a smooth and mellow finish. Earth, light tartness and slow drying emerge in a transcendental finale. The mouthfeel is softly and moderately carbonated, creamy, medium bodied and lightly sticky and tannic. 


 
2006. 8/5/8/4/16

Pours a hazy dark amber, burned reds within. A mid-sized off-white/cream colored head slowly and mostly dissipates. Dot and arc lacing is miniscule. Tropical fruit streams from the vessel, a powerhouse that is awash with lively young funk that seems to have yet to reveal its true intentions. Vinous notes are lesser than older vintages and subdued by cream sensations. Alcohol is brash and unmanaged, yet to settle into a complacent complimentary role. A mustiness that must(no pun intended) fade into eloquence with a long slumber in this glass keepsake is a surprise upon first sip. Sweetness is low-medium to medium and fruitiness remains heavy but doesnt succeed in sugary aspirations. Acidity is chunky and fueled by light acetic quirks. Alcohol is signifigantly warming. The finish is semi-sweet and succinct, tannins finally revealing peppery spiciness. Woodiness is very forceful and certainly the most evident at this young age. The mouthfeel is moderately carbonated and medium bodied, agreeably smooth and certifiably younger than desirable for most enjoyable consumption.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Medium-bodied and slick, it finishes extra dry. The flavor follows the nose: dry, vinous and woody. Even though my pour was from ""the dregs"" of the bottle, this was very tasty.

The dark sour fruits like cherries and lemons start to come through first with some malts and oak in the background. This bottle has definitely picked up some funk as well.

This is one is full bodied and perfectly carbonated on the palate that finishes dry with a slight sour aftertaste. I am really glad I found one of these. This is one of my favorites from these guys. De Dolle never seems to disappoint.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
3390,"2007-11-06",4.3,"2006. Poured dark red with good size off white head. Aroma of sour fruit (apples, cherries, and grapes) and some candy hints. Great sour fruit flavor to start with a sweeter malt/candy background. Great balance.","Hainesport, New Jersey, USA","johnadam2002"
3390,"2007-11-04",4.3,"2005 bottle courtesy of footbalm (thanks!).  Poured slightly muddy dark brown with small tan head.  The aroma...my oh my, very sexy.  Red wine, cherries, apples, sour funk, oak.  I couldve kept my nose in there all night.  Taste came up slightly short of the aroma, but I sure didnt mind.  Apples at the forefront, followed by cherries and oak.  Moderately sour and ever so slightly boozy.  The palate was medium to light, which I must say came as a bit of a surprise for such a big beer.  Finished nice and dry though, which was a plus.  Very glad Ive got another 2 bottles.  Ill be seeing this one again in 2008...know that.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"

Pour was a delicious dark brown with a huge pillowy 3 finger white head. Taste was like a Flemish sour but with more of an alcohol kick. Strong wood, cherry and sour fruit flavor with a little alcohol burn. I was going to have one rating after this, but I have to end my October now.

2005 bottle, sampled 3/7/09 at Teresas next door basement blowout- chestnut pour with a small tan head. Beautiful aroma, tart cherry at the forefront, with mild oak and vinous notes.

3390,"2007-10-09",3.8,"2005 bottle from The_Epeeist.  Thanks Chris!  Pours with a large 1 finger tan head that quickly dissipates to a continuously forming small bubble ring arond the edge.  A cloudy super dark red-brown color. Oak and wine from barrel aging is very evident and dominating the aroma. Fun to smell.  From this I want to describe the smell as vinous.  Smallest amount of dark yeast sediment in bottom of bottle.  Flavor is dry and a bit tart.  A bit reminiscent of champagne with its higher carbonation, dryness, and vinous taste/aroma, but much better than most champagnes as there is no skunkiness.  Lots of residual non-sweet fruity flavors of cherry.  I prefer brandy and bourbon barrel aging, and I prefer more sweetness in general, which brings down the rating to me, but I think the beer is very well done otherwise.  Add cheese and my rating might go up...maybe.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
3390,"2007-09-29",4.2,"From a 33cL Bottle, 2005 Vintage.  Purchased at OBriens, 9/28/07.  Pours a dark cherry wood brown color with a huge layer of light meringue-like foam.  Dark red grape skins mingle with some leathery cherries and a woody dryness.  A subtle dash of peppery spice and toasted mace add further complexity.  Light bodied, heavily carbonated mouthfeel.  This is incredibly dry and light for 13% ABV, an amazing feat in and of itself.  Tons of dark cherries and black currants explode onto the palate, accompanied by a dry wine skin tannic pucker.  A light spice and dark woody notes come through mid-palate, lingering with the vinous fruit notes into the final smack.  Great balance; tart, mild acidity, and loads of fruit.  Never a disappointment; always a pleasure.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

My nose received hints of apple, spice, and coffee cake. The palate is bombarded with sour hay notes, raisin, grapes, more apple, roasted nuts, and a tiny amount of maple syrup.

For some reason it smelled like Sprite or 7Up: its like you could smell the heavy carbonation and the overall sourness.

3390,"2007-07-06",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2013 7/6/07 - 11.2 oz bottle.  2005.  Dark woody brown with a brief tan head.  Sour cherries and lemon oil.  Earthy undertones.  Creamy mouthfeel becomes increasingly tart.  Subtle fruit elements heavy on peel, pit and pepper.  Vinous notes; white burgundy?  Dry oaky finish.  Interesting play of sour and bitter.  3/19/08 - 11.2 oz bottle.  2002.  Dark brown, but clear, with a light tan frosting.  Nose is wood, dried apricot, caramel, raisins and figs.  Lightly sour, intoxicatingly sweet.  Taste is among the most complex ive encountered.  Drinks like a red wine with a bit of carb tingle.  Taste is vinous, sour caramel, hints of red fruit and cherry skins.  Oak adds smoothness.  Puckery finish, peppery lips.  Having tried two years of the Reserva i still prefer the regular. I added 2 for the aroma and a point overall.  7/9/09 - 11.2 oz bottle.  2004.  Murky brown with sparse beige foam.  Nose is sour cherry, wood and hints of caramel with subtle funk.  Medium light with fine carb.  Silky then tart.  Tastes like a red wine with a touch of madeira and wild mushroom.  Turns to sour crabapples, finishing with dried apricots.  As it warmed, opened up beautifully but missing that hint of sweetness in the regular version.  Same rating overall except for the aroma which i gave a 7.  6/23/10 - 11.2 oz bottle. 2006.  Cloudy brown with a creamy beige head.  Vinous nose with oak and cherry.  Medium body with a tang.  Taste is sour cherry, oak and apple.  A tad sweeter than other versions but still predominantly sour and woody.  Aroma lacks some complexity; revised to an 8.  4/20/11 - 11.2 oz bottle.  2007.  I seem to be trying these once a year.  Nose is that familiar oak, cherry and caramel with earthy hints of wild mushrooms and wet leaves.  Juicy medium body with a bracing sour tang.  Taste is tart cherry, red wine, oak and spice.  Still a 4.  10/1/11 - 11.2 oz bottle. 2009.  Nose is sour cherry, wood, mushrooms and toffee.  Thick, but more whipped up as opposed to syrupy, with foamy carb and a sharp tang.  Taste is huge and bright sour cherry, strawberry banana and oak finishing with key lime pie.  The earthy, funky notes ive seen in other vintages are present but this is by far the most vibrant of the lot.  9 for taste but only 7 for the aroma so keeping this at 4.  1/24/12 - 11.2 oz bottle.  2010.  I seem to age these a bit more, this one relatively fresh at a year+.  Nose is cherry preserves, toffee, oak, light funk and wine vinegar.  Wonderfully juicy and mouth watering with soft but lively carb.  Taste ranges from sweet to tart cherry, raspberry and cranberry, wood and red wine with cinnamon heat.  Id up the palate to a 4 for this one but will leave the overall rating at a 4.0.  Fresh seems to be the way to go with these.  1/8/13 - 11.2 oz bottle.  2008.  Omigod, the aroma on this vintage is through the roof.  Strawberry banana, funky caramel, burgundy, faint wood, pepper and vanilla.  Medium body with a dull sparkle, verging on flat.  Unfortunately the taste falls short on expectations from the nose.  Caramel, chianti and cinnamon stick.  Always a cool brew.  Maybe a 4.1 on this one.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
3390,"2007-06-29",4.5,"Bottle. By fare the closest to a red wine experience that I have ever come across, without it being a red wine! Partly because this brew have been maturing in old red wine oak barrels, and that heavily shows in the overall impression of this remarkable beer. Large creamy light brown head that mostly lasted. Held up to a light source, the body was somewhat clear and sparkling. The color was light dark with a reddish glow. Aroma was bread, dust and grain, toasted notes, grape, prune, raspberry, very vinous with a mix of sour milk and acidic fruity notes as well. Full bodied with a light alcoholic and sticky texture and a soft carbonation. Flavor was mixed between moderated acidic and light to moderated sweet and hint of bitter notes as well. Finish was plastered everywhere in your mouth and lovely lasting feel that you dont want to let go off. Thank heaven for trying this lovely brew!!","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Grovlam"

The body is a muddy brown and the head tries to keep it together, but loses the battle. Very tart, vinous tasting fore. Lightly oaky, but mostly the wine comes through. Fairly biting carbonation. Soury and funky on the back of the tongue. A sour tartness lingers long on the tongue compelling the mouth to smack and the tongue to caress its lips. This is a beer you ease into. It becomes simultaneously more nuanced and stronger in concentration as you sip.

3390,"2007-04-07",4.1,"The aroma was fruity and complex with a strong vinous characteristic and oak presence. Alcohol tickled the nasal passages and was coupled with a light and interesting tart complexity that brought forth dark fruits of raisins and prunes. A Belgian yeast spice presence was also nice and notable. The beer poured into the Oerbier tulip deep amber brown with an off-white tight bubbled head which stood tall and laced the glass from top to bottom. The flavor was vinous and tart with a bready character and a light citrus characteristic of Brett. The flavor contained dark fruits, raisins and prunes, with some caramel and candy characteristics lurking in the background. The Belgian yeast spice presence was slight and well done. The tartness was strong, but added complexity and depth to the beer which also exhibited vinous characteristics and oak. The finish was dry with lasting citrusy and bready Brett character fading into the aftertaste. The body was above medium and was spritzy with a high level of carbonation.

Also noted bits of candied sugar and figs. A little funky which I like. Flavor is fruity (red grapes, mainly) with alcohol, oak, and a sweet vinegar finish. Carbonation and mouthfeel is lively throughout, almost a little too lively at times. While the heavy does of alcohol is well noted, this is a very drinkable 13% beer and no doubt 5 years of aging in bordeaux casks and in the bottle have done it well.

Pours a cloudy orange brown with a 1 1/2 finger light beige head.  Aroma of sour oak, sour cherries, sour grapes--this smells a lot like a lambic up front, something stale and vinous.  Flavor is again quite tart with a bit of raisins poking up with a pleasant alcohol warmth--not 13%, mind you.  I was afraid the sourness would attack me and be way too strong, and while it was full of flavor, I didnt feel assaulted.  There was also a bit of brown sugar that never had the chance to show any sweetness.  Bone dry finish with little bitterness.  Low to moderate carbonation with a medium body.

3390,"2007-02-18",4.2,"Bottled (13%, 2005 version). Thanks goes to GarethYoung for this bottle, which I decided to share with rsmeds on his marriageday. Dark cloudy syrupyish reddish/brown colour with huge beige creamy head. The aroma is grapes, alcohol and sour fruits. Flavour is quite the same, along with some grassy notes on the tip of the tongue. Also lots of cocoa to be found behind the sourness once it gets warmer. The burps you burp after this also taste like cocoa or milk chocolate. Overall an extremely complex beer, which probably ages well and might make it a bit smoother.","Vasa, FINLAND","oh6gdx"

Pours a murky yellowish-brown appearance; off-white head with beautiful lacing at the edges.  Tart, complex aroma: cherries, oak, and vinous red fruits.  Pleasant level of sourness, in a full mouthfeel; so many things going on here: overripe sour cherries, woody and warm vanilla notes; medium acidity; levels upon levels of oak and cherries and barrel flavor.  Long, balanced, cherry and wood finish.

Multiple bottles since; within a year or two, tartness hasnt developed enough to reach its peak; 3-4 years seems ideal.

Taste of tart apple, vinous oak, brett, cherry, and sweet acids. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, dry, with soft carbonation. Very nice, but perhaps an acquired taste, as the brett has certainly taken ahold of this one! Plenty of oak, cherry, and brett to hide the ABV.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","TheBeerOrg"

Lots of carbonation but the head diminishes very fast.  Aroma is outstanding, acidic pineapple brett with freshly emptied red wine barrel.  Flavor has a somewhat sweet crystal malt base that quickly gets overrun by the acidity and the cask influence.  Slight horse blanket funk but very low levels.  More brett fruitiness combined with a light and fruity red wine and oak.  Also has flavors of apple cider.  Alcohol is extremely well hidden and is hard to think that this is 13%.

Amber orange pour, with lacy soap of white. On the tongue, that sweet and sour Brett lactic presentation, followed by cursory sour apple skin and chestnut meat. This holds a dash of coarsely ground pink pepper. Smack rules. New fresh morphing flavors develop in the residuals that linger, some of sultry fatty-acid heft and some pineapple meat. Lots of pale grapes and their respective skins and juice, before closing with a crisp wheaty bite. This hid 13% alcohol? Incredible.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

3390,"2007-01-06",4.2,"eight six nine Vertical time 2002, 2004, 2005 get low, a get low.  Some interesting differences.  The 2002 still had plenty of power and ageability.  The maltiness came out most with tihs one, turned very biscuity, almost an English like malt flavor emerged.  The sourness was still there, very strong actually. The 2004 had a lot of fruitiness in its sourness, also more vinegar and more tartness than any other vintage.2005 was darker than the other two, a dark burgundy ruby red.  It was the least sour, milder in all aspects acttually.  Still had some sourness but lacked the acidity of the 04 and the maltiness of the 02.  
Overall, I would take the 02 over the rest.  The 04 was great if its sourness I strictly wanted and the 05 may need to sit a bit.  Also, no alcohol presence at all, I thought this was more like  5% brew, have no idea where all that alcohol came from.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

3390,"2006-12-13",4.4,"***2002 Edition*** Pours a dark brown, with cranberry red, purple, and gray tinting. Head is toasted white bread, surprisingly large for being nearly 5 years old, but dissipating quickly, with widely spaced, rainbow bubbles. A tad of yeast falls onto the sparse sheet of bubbles that remain throughout the drink. More bubbles continually rise from the bottom of the glass. Aroma is vinous, with apple, pear, roasted spices and burnt sugars. Quite tantalizing. Taste is full luscious, fruit malt, grapes, apples, dates and an acidic sour that thinly coats and stings the  inside walls of the mouth. Taste is cherries, caramel, lemony hops, pepper, alcohol -- strong, but well held. Aftertaste is burnt mahogany, drying from the alcohol Interesting enough to keep tipping glass, strong enough to instill moderation. I just wish I had a case of these as opposed to my one.

3390,"2006-11-29",4.2,"12 oz bottles, 2002 and 2004 vintages side by side, 2004 bottle via footbalm.  Rating numbers are for the 2004 bottle, which I prefered much more.  Pours were similar, a rather murky looking reddish brown colored body under a light brown foamy head on the 2002, minimal to no head on the 2004.  2004 aroma is lightly tart with alot of woody notes, good amount of yeast, and very fruity, similar to a Flemish Sour.  The 2002 was very different, lots of sherry and port oxidation notes, minimal fruitiness that removed my association with Flemish Sours, and a stronger alcohol note.  Flavors followed the aromas almost step in step.  2004 was very fruity and much more tart, slightly acidic and almost completely hidden alcohol.  The 2002 was fairly oxidized, lending a very sherry like flavor to it.  The alcohol was alot more noticable as well.  I suppose the fruit fades but the alcohol stays.  Both vintages had a similar mouthfeel, but the 2002 was a bit thinner.  Similar moderately active carbonation.  Overall, I found the 2004 to be far superior even though Im a fan of aged beers.  It was alot more similar to the standard Oerbier at least and I guess Im basing it on that.  The 2002 would have rated somewhere in the neighborhood of a 3.9 total.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Alcohol is present, medicinal, as is some malt vinegar, burnt tight fruits and clean brandy, oak aged yeast extractions, tannins and vine clippings and just a little, little whiff of bitter chocolate to remind me of the beers namesake. As with HogTownHarry my notes read that the body is unbelievably and unremarkably light in the mouth. Almost too well attenuated, like it all got sucked up and spat out as alcohol and CO2 as the alcohol is aggressive and the carbonation makes it a little too harsh and prickly on the tongue. Deeply vinous, again showing the same traits as the aroma. Its got some tart, ripe aswell as aged fruits that give it a heavy puckering astringency that is also unexpected to the palate. Light showing of oak, fresh-chopped herbs, stinging nettles, grape tannins and a touch of Moselle that dries it out. Finish is a little harsh, unrefined yet it doesnt linger for too long aside from some woody notes and a little pepper and higher alcohols. Not all together impressed with this one. Sure it could get you arsed in half the time, but Ive tasted beers with half the alcohol that blow it out the water as far as overall complexity. Another couple of years and Id say it would be a high octane malt-vinegar so a younger one might be the go. On the positive, its certainly unique.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"
3390,"2006-08-27",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2006 Bottle (330ml - 2004 vintage).  Deep brownish ruby with a large, lasting, fluffy-creamy slightly off-white head.  Aroma is very much like a good Flemish sour, extra-strong alcohol - tart/sour - almost green - red currant, cherry, other berryfruit - yeast, wood resin and lemon zest; mildly vinous.  Taste is similar - reminds me oddly of Goudenband, heck, even Orval - spicy/yeasty, alcohol, sour fruit, dry citrus, even a hint of vinegar - I totally see jehoeys mentioning of a dry Spanish champagne.  The body is .. I guess a little light, hard to tell, its so continually fizzy and lively - medium acidity - I dont know what I was expecting, but this surprised me.  It grew on me a lot by the bottom of the bottle, very tart and funky.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
3390,"2006-08-17",4.0,"33cl bottle that was brewed in 2002:  an interesting and very complex beer.  aroma of merlot wine, bourbon, and alcohol.  pours a murky dark brown much like Rochfort 8.  Has a small head that disipates quickly into a thin film.  Flavor is much like the aroma.  nots of plum, blackberry (very merlot like), but at the same time it tastes like a dry spainish champagne, and has the elements of a belgian ale, again like Rochfort 8.

3390,"2006-08-11",3.5,"2004 Vintage.   Pours a murky, sepia/golden with obvious sediment hovering about. Upon swirling, a creamy, khaki head merges with sticky legs to slither gently back into the body like the ebb of a frothy tide. Fruity aroma with overwhelming alcohol precedes wine, then malts, then cheese... complex and attractive yet overpowered by esters. Tart flavor with a tingle and burn, vinous with funky yeastiness. Somewhat light bodied with a dry finish while the 13% hits like a hammer in the aftertaste. Definitely eyebrow-raising.

3390,"2006-07-02",4.4,"2004 bottle. I was incredibly psyched when I spotted this bottle on a shelf, as late as June 2006! It was gone a week later. Aroma of oak, cherry, raspberry, woody scotch, bubblegum, licorice. The scotch becomes pretty heavy; thankfully, it hardly shows up in the flavor. Taste starts with a sweet breadiness and descends into tart, cherry, rustic bourbon and brett, oaky love. Licorice shows up here, too. My notes for regular Oerbier and pretty skimpy, though I dont remember it tasting much like this beast at all. This is one killer beer.

Another 2002 (yes, 12 years old) Bottle, Purchased at Whole Foods, Vienna Virginia on 30-June-2006 for US$5.99, Received by Store or Distributor on 21-February-2004:
Sampled this as part of my 4500 Rating Celebration:
Muddy ruby brown coloured body with a non-existant tan head. Aroma of very sour grapes, cherries, raisins, figs, malt, earth, smoked peat and quite a bit of alcohol and cognac - very refreshing, intoxicating and complex. Medium to Full-bodied; Rich cherry flavour at first with a very earthy and nutty flavour and a cognac and whiskey flavour right afterwards, all ending with a lot of caramel and toffee sweetness and a hint of the sour grape flavour. Aftertaste ridiculously complex with the malts intertwined with scotch and brandy flavours, some apples and oak all touched up by the sweetness and finally a good sour twang that still persists in a beer twelve years old. Overall, a very nice and complex beer that shows its age very well. In reviewing my old rating, its definitely lost the effervescence (not sure where it went), and lost quite a bit of body - its almost thin now. However, the complexity seems to have expanded with more of a pit fruit flavour and a lot more caramel and dry oaky notes. Rating for this review: 9,3,9,5,16

<!-- b -->2002 Batch:<!-- /b --><!-- br -->Saved this bottle for quite a while - the first beer I cracked after just turning 25 and also the first beer ive rated in quite a long time! Fizzed incessantly when I popped the top, all over the counter...but most ended up in the glass. A few minutes later and im good to go. Nice dark brown coloured body with a strong ruby highlight when held to a light. Good slightly off-white head tops the beer at a half a centimetre thick. Complex aroma of sour grapes and apples, strong alcoholic scents, some vanilla and oak noticeable and finally some nuts in the finish - nice smell, all over the map. Medium to Full-bodied; Strong sour taste up front fading to a nice alcoholic kick all followed by a very noticeable vanilla and oak flavour. Sweet near the middle of the sample, then fading to a bitter end. Aftertaste shows all of the oaky tastes from this one, along with some grapeyness and even some nuts and malt. Overall, a very complex beer that was well worth waiting for! I sampled this 33 cL bottle purchased from Whole Foods in Vienna, Virginia on 30-June-2006. This was a 2002 bottle, just to clarify.

3390,"2006-06-22",4.4,"""I sampled the 2002 version of this brew, which I bought at Toronado in San Francisco. The pour was dark brown with red highlights and a nice beige head that stuck around awhile. The aroma was friuty and sweet, and you could tell that it had a sour factor to it as well--smelled a lot like a flemish sour. The taste was definitely sour, and fruity--with the wood flavors coming through in the end, and they were definitely present. This is a very complex tasting beer. The mouthfeel was nice, light and effervescent. A very good beer, that I enjoyed more and more as I comsumed it. ""","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"
3390,"2006-06-17",3.6,"2004. Pretty crazy beer.  Nothing at all like the regular Oerbier.  Lots of bret stank in the aroma.  A fair amount of bret sourness, nicely played against some woody wine flavor.  Only on the finish do you get any of that bready yeast flavor.  Pretty interesting and pretty good.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"
3390,"2006-06-12",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2010 Re-rate, 2006 Vintage in Jan 2010: Very fantastic. Well-done brew, glad I sat on this one for a while, especially since bret/oak/funky brews are the bomb now. Very well done, softly sour/tart cherries, brown malts, huge big body, well supported sour funky brew, mouthfeel was almost creamy, alcohol smooth as day. A residual sweetness was even present. My kind of brew. 2002 Vintage: Ok, I dont care, Ill do it. Sure, Ill be one of the low guys, a full standard deviation away from the mean (ie. in the bottom ~15 percentile of raters). Go ahead, flog me, deem me a heretic. Poured a murky brown color with a thin head that stuck well with the beer. Lacing decent, really good for a 12% ABV beer. The aroma was all vinous and grape-like with some raisins, light wood. The flavor was really vinous and somewhat harsh, again lots of grapes and apples there to attack the tongue, leaving behind oaky wood remnants. Raisins and caramel malts were very prominent in other sips. Tart and sour notes leave the tongue a bit acidic with each sip, although the warming temperatures brought back some sweet-sour imprints that I remember from the oerbier. This beer is really complex, Ill give it that. Still, this thing, for being a 2002 vintage, sure seemed rough and even a bit astringent for having come so far and being supposedly matured in barrels. The oak aging doesnt do it for me in all beer styles, and it clashed here for me.","","User37895"

The initial taste is mildly sour, mildly tart cherries, raspberries, red wine vinegar, some sweetness. The finish is a burst of tart fruits, oak, and vanilla. The aftertaste is mildly astringent.

Another sip refreshes the tangy zing with a vinegar and wine flavor.  Really an amazing beer.  The huge initial sourness is large but does not offend the palate.

I find it hard to believe that these are pretty much the same beer.  Very dry and vinous, like a red wine.  Sour and tart mouthfeel, more like a saison or Flemish sour than the regular Oerbier.

Very beautiful red color with a lightly oxidized brown color that creates even more depth and richness and is unobtainable through malt alone.  The head is pale tan color, rocky, and honey-combed in structure at the bottom.  Aroma is bubblegum, slight sourness from acetobacters not unlike a flemish red/brown ale, a chocolate-caramel maltiness, and overripe bananas.  Flavor is dissappointing.  All the aroma components are in the flavor but are muddledinto one disorganized, unfortunate mess.  It is not a tapestry of flavor where you pick out the subtle complexities nor is it layered with flavor where one flavor rolls into the next then into the next.  Not done trashing this yet.  Instead of the aged, soft, complex flavor of balsamic vinegar, this one has the burning, unsubtle flavor of $0.99/gallon, distilled, white vinegar.

Hints of apples in the flavor, along with some interesting spices I cant quite put my finger on.  Very woody and earthy, probably due to the wine casks it was aged in.

Its very complex aroma wise and you can really notice it after a while when the beer has warmed up a bit.  Flavor is fantastic.  It is a malty/fruitty beer that has a slightly sour taste, Im thinking from brett.  It is very smooth, I really cant say I noticed too much oak barrel aging in this beer.

3390,"2005-06-12",4.0,"2002 330ml Bottle courtesy of sick_boy282 in trade: Hazy, mostly opaque rusty brown body with a small, fleeting beige head.  Aroma is tart fruit at first, hinting at aged figs, plums, and over-ripe apples wrapped in leather and given a splash of balsamic vinegar.  Allowing this beer time to breathe gives a bit more complexity to the already fantastic aroma - sour orange rind, bitter wine grapes, old wood, dark chocolate, nutmeg, anise, sour apple cider, and brown sugar.  Flavor is sweet & sour up front, quickly hitting your palate with an impressive and diverse array of flavors: sour figs & plums, freshly ground pepper, dates, sour grapes, leather, acidic wet wood, sour cherries, tart molasses (if there is such a thing), wine-soaked dirt, and even a hint of grains and bread dough.  This beer is full of tannins and very complex - not a beer youd want to down quickly.  Medium to full bodied, thick and oily body, with moderate carbonation (first one Ive had like this from De Dolle).

Aroma is spicy, lots of fruity apple notes and plenty of vinous characteristics. Taste starts off with a sharp sweetness and fruitiness of apples and cherries before going overboard with an almost unpalatable sour tartness that is unpleasant. The taste is complex with those flavors as well as plenty of vinous notes and alcohol taste that only adds to the mayhem. Mouthfeel is good and full with a coated feel, which in this case only spreads the unpleasant taste. I would say this is fairly undrinkable in my opinion.

3390,"2004-09-10",4.0,"Plummy brown haze in color, more glowing towards the bottom than at the top, medium sized frothy whipped creamy dark beige head, settles slowly if at all to a creamy thick skim; lacing in the stringy thick variety.

Aroma is soft of peppermint-like spicy alcoholic heat mixed with a strange, unidentifable dark citrus melange, graham cracker crust, and a bit of a merlot type of touch with dark red grapes and some ripe plum. Its a very soft nose, even the heat seems soft; nothing overly exciting or strong but it definately has a great subtlety and complexing waft about it.

Taste is a whole nother conceivability in its character from what the aroma leads you to believe. But those little hints of wine-like character do surge forward now. Upon first touching the lips its a delightfully smooth ride, but thats literally swiped away quickly, so quickly in fact its hard to get an overall of what the bier is doing. Why, cuz it gets all crazy with a semi-tart and souring little wine-like character that completely takes over the character. Grapey and plummy with touched with citrus tang of oranges. This settled down in a hurry though as it warmed; and thank goodness for that, when first outta the fridge this was frightening with a souring, off flavor of red grapes and tart lemon/orange. But it resides in its strength as it warms and becomes much more drinkable and enjoyable with more plum aspects floating in and some very light drying off in the finish of vinous qualities mixed with a bit of spicy candied alcohol.

Feel is spicy and boardering a sweet tartness thats bearable and vinous to the point of acceptance and tone for a bier of this nature, which may throw some folks for a loop when first taking a sip. The alcoholic heat and spice is quite warming late, way beyond having a any and all sips. Incredible in that respect. Has about a medium body and has a slight throaty burn that keeps popping through very, very late. Medicinal in a way but not overly so. Lots of yeasty alcoholic action in this stuff the whole trip through.

The first sip was antagonizing, but the last was a wish for more. This reminded me more of some of the English style Old Ales that are tangy and souring sweet. This stuff is all about that, but with more control over the effects of the malt side then those with more of yeasty spiced alcohol and vinous softness around its character that was fun to behold and take in for a night ending sipper.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Rating# 550
 Pours a murky mahogany body and a fat and fluffy light tan colored head. The aroma is rather sharp with notes of bionomic vinegar and fresh apple cider. I can smell a depth to this brew a tartness that is clocked with a lightly toasted and sweet note of maple syrup. 
The flavor is F-ing Spectacular! There is a so much going on as far as spice and bitter sweet contrasting its absolutely insane! 
My conceived mental recipe, but without individual ingredients: A hand kneaded lump of wheat bread dough,  A few cups of Golden Delicious pressed apple juice, about a cup of red Merlot grapes, a good portion of orange zests, several hands full of raisins. All tossed and blended in a mortar and then hand ground with a petal:  black peppercorn, rosemary, clove, and a suggestion of thyme. Now, add several ounces of grade-A maple syrup.. Mix the listed ingredients into a large conical and copiously blend the ingredients, then pour into a small oak cask that has recently aged a 30-year Porto. Allow a year for the earthy notes of the oak and the cloying and nutty flavors of the Porto to permeate / intermingle / and expand the fresh ingredients... and this MattAs mental process! The palate is extraordinarily sticky, yet velvety.. an absolute work of genius I tell you!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

3390,"2004-06-26",4.3,"06.26.04  330ml bottle.  First off, everyone is calling this beer ""hazy"" or ""cloudy"" but mine poured crystal clear.  Dark indeed, a deep, red, teakwood brown, but I can clearly see the stream of bubbles rising from the etching in the bottom of my tulip glass.  I didnt pour too slowly and I got about 2cm of creamy beige head from a chilled (44 F) beer.  That said, on to the aromas:  Ripe pear is the first and most prominant of the fruity aromas, I also note spiced apple, cherry pie, raisin, and I sense that this beer will be sour.  And sour it is from front to back, yum!  Lots of woodsy flavors blend nicely with dark fruits, cherry notes, and fruity acidity.  Alcohol comes through in the finish in a cidery kind of way.

3390,"2004-06-14",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2008 Re-Rate. 2006 vintage; bottle purchased and drunk at Kulminator, Antwerp.  Transluscent dark brown-ruby in the glass with a mostly diminishing tan head.  Smells are Rodenbach-ish, with sour cherry not quite as warm and full as in Rodenbach beers, mixed with Granny Smith apples and light spices.  Taste was not as sour as I expected after the smell.  This picked up a lot of good barrel character: dry on the tongue with a dark plum undertone at first with fizzy, winey alcohol and cherries in the middle; finish displays a tannic and distinctly wood driness after a slight burst of citric acidity.  Further sips show the cherry in the middle to be wonderfully distinct, yet surrouned by slightly tobacco-ish tastes and lots of wood.  Wonderful counterpoints of barrel tannins and driness with the juiciness up front and at the very beginning of the finish.  Worlds better than the previous bottle I had, which was probably a 2004 vintage.  The overall score above is a combination of the two ratings heavily weighted toward this more recent one.  8/4/9/5/18 = 4.4.

Original Rating.6/14/2004. Bottle, Maproom, Chicago.  Im slightly unsettled by this.  I liked it, but I felt like I maybe shouldnt, or that I should like it more but didnt.  It just didnt feel right.  As the first Oerbier Ive had, maybe I was discovering that I dont like the style.  Either way, despite any misgivings, I liked it.  I smelled cherry with a garnish of spruce and a little honey.  It poured a deep amber color with an almost off-white head that was mostly diminishing.  Initially, it tasted lightly sweet, moderate-to-heavily acidic and not at all bitter.  The finish picked up some bitter, kept the sweetness and the acidity.  It reminded me of a combination of grapefruit and banana.  7/4/7/4/15 = 3.7.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

3390,"2004-03-22",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2015 2002 bottle 6-8 months after bottlingWow, magnificent aroma of bordeaux wine, quite young smelling, with some definite oakiness.  Also lurking in there is some alcohol, ripe berries, light citrus and plenty of yeast.  Aroma is incredibly sniffable and full.  Moderately hazy (bottle conditioned it says) with some light apricot oranges, some rose tinges and a lovely off-white head with some light reddish hues.  Big vinous flavor immediately sets in, with tons of wood notes, a hint of cherry and then the beer comes on.  Medium-full body, tremendously chewy yeast and ever so delicately lurking.  The bordeaux certainly takes the show, but the beer adds a decidedly yeasty flavor, that works very well.  Finish is chewy, some hints of caramel, with a hint of spice.  A bit of orange fruit towards the end and some sweetness comes out.  On the aftertaste is a lingering flavor of strawberries and grapes that is immensely pleasant.  A beer that does so many things.  I could easily sip this beer for hours on end.  Deliciciously complex and brings the best of both worlds. Tons of leathery tannins, grape skin and on the finish a flavor that reminds me much of pomegranate. Exquisite with strong, ripe cheese.  The only thing I wanted more of, was a bit more malt depth, to provide a more powerful beer flavor. But then, I think I need to appreciate the subtlety.>2005 bottle drunk on 9/30/07Extremely enticing aroma is much more apple-like and tart than expected.  Juicy and tart red/pink apples, with a touch of grape enliven this fully fruity aroma, as a well-attenuated maltiness of raisins, light caramel and honey brace it.  Light phenols and very soft wood notes that help soften the alcohol (which is, then, very well-concealed).  Very strong aroma, with no flaws.Delicious Belgian Dark Strong ale shows so much more interesting yeast character than almost all in its class, which is why De Dolle is so well set apart from other brewers.2015 bottle drunk 12/12/15 at Festivus 2 (brewed 2013).Not having had this one in over 8 years, but being very curious and having such strong memories, I urged my friend to get a bottle for $12 bucks.  Not bad at all for a bar price.Unfortunately, while I wasnt disappointed in the beer overall, I was disappointed relative to how well I remember the beer.  The integrity of the aroma and flavor was not so much the problem, as the very thin, bone dry, nearly astringent texture.  Very, very light in body and though the carbonation was tight and natural, I was just left wondering where was the supple maltiness that I remembered?  Incredibly dry, slightly chalky, heavily mineralesque wine and barrel notes greatly outdo the thinned-out body.  Still, a pleasant drink and you could certainly do much, much worse.  Will have to try some old bottles to see if my tastes have changed or this was just a subpar batch.  Sounds like Ernest was unimpressed, as well, though.  8/4/8/3/15.Rating is a mix of the 3 vintages Ive rated.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Served at room temperature.  Small beige head atop a clear copper body.  Aroma is medium sweet, vinous -- some plum and cherry.  Taste is medium sweet, vinous, some wood, plum, apple.  The alcohol is noticeable, particularly in the warming finish, but despite having much more than the regular Oerbier, its presence is much more restrained.

Once again, De Dolle continues to run middle of the road whereas everyone keeps pumpin them up near the top 50...and i just dont get it. This beer poured a cloudy and murky wood and mahogany brown color with a slight tanned island of head. There was definitely some alcohol present in the nose with definite fruity notes....wood and plum come to mind. This beer was absolutely rough up front, but 12% will do that to a person! The finish however was surprisingly smooth. Heavy malty and raisiny finish...super dry..made me cringe it was so damn dry..but once again, 12% will do that to you! Deep sweet fruits in the finish..raisins and plums, with a hint of grapefruit and citrus. There were definitely some oak aged qualities as the beer went along.

ORIGINAL RATING: 1/17/04.  Poured out of 330 mL bottle, bought at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA 12/10/03.  Damn, this stuff is amazing.  Wish I had more of it.  Pours to a dark reddish-amber color, clear with a slightly smaller than expected head (used to those mammoth explosions of carbonation that most De Dolle beers offer), but expectedly terrific retention.  Aroma is unbelieveable-- incredibly strong, sour oak and vinous notes, a hint of vinegar and some cherry and grape fruitiness.  Very much like a wine.  Taste is totally overwhelming, even upon its first sip-- strong alcohol heat and sharpness, heavy tannins and cherry, oak, peat, and raisiny, resinous flavors.  Just extremely tart and astringent.  A bit of vinegar somewhere in there too, on the nose and especially on the taste.  Literally breathtaking in its intensity, as I found myself gasping at least once from the power of this brew.  This one could use some time, methinks.  On the finish, my mouth just begs with equal strength to have more and to have respite from the intensity.  After the assault is past, theres a quite nice pepperiness left over from the alcohol and a hum of yeasty, estery sugars-- finally some sweetness pokes through.  Very long finish and very complex, but not quite as elegant as Id hope it will get with (a lot) more time.  Simply amazing stuff, but it needs to rest before I drink another bottle of it. . .

3390,"2004-01-10",4.5,"330 ml bottle, courtesy of The Man, Psychprof.  Murky cherry body, large but fast-fading unstable head.  Nose at first surprisingly citric (grapefruit) and one-note, but quickly warms into something rather spectacular, with toffee, sour cherry, melted butter, a bit of vanilla and yeah, that oaky whiskey quality.  Just fabulous.  Alcohol initially fairly heavy on the tongue, but does little to spoil the intense sour-fruit acid quality as this treasure burns of trail of joy down your throat.  Amazingly smooth going down, and the warmth just gradually builds.  12%?  Doesn't really measure.  ecrvich is pretty well spot-on in describing this as a beefed-up Flemish Sour, and though I doubt I'd take it over Rodenbach Grand Cru, it's pretty special.

3390,"2004-01-05",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2006 2002 Release, Sampled 22nd of December, 2003
Aromas of plum and raisin waft from the glass as I pour the beer.  It is a hazy amber color, and the beer forms a tan head when roused.  Aromas of alcohol, sherry and dark fruit in the nose, and perhaps a hint of sourness.  The aroma reminds me of a fruit cocktail.

The taste is lightly sour and has a tannic back bone to it akin to an oaky wine.  There is a bit of buttery-vanilla taste in the finish, that is quite persistent though fairly subtle.  Ah, I see on the bottle that it was aged in oak, so the oak presence certainly makes sense.  The tannins and the acidity really dry this beer out, though there is a bit of sweetness that pokes through the dryness.

As I sniff the the aroma again I can definitely pick out the oak here as well.  Not nearly as fruity in the taste as it was in the initial aroma.  There is some definite funky Belgian yeast character here, but the oak is the dominant flavor.

I am glad I have another bottle of this, I think that this will be awesome in 2007.  At this point the oak character is disproportionally large compared to the beer character.  Like a fine wine though, I have a feeling this one will age very well.  Thus my rating is based on the potential of this beer.  If I had to rate it on only this bottle I would give it a 3.4.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3390,"2003-12-22",3.5,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2008 4-year-old 2004 bottle:
Lots of juicy cherries burst in the nose, but are shrunk by wooden dryness and dusty yeast in the flavor profile. A pleasant tartness is created, one which lasts till the very end. There is not much complexity here, but a lot of fun flavors reign and alcohol is never bothersome. I compared this to a fresh Cuvée de Tomme, and I guess it didnt help the Oerbier at all. A fun sour sipper, but it doesnt taste as special as its billing. I have to say though that this batch seems to have survived a lot better than the 2002 I had previously had. 3.5/5

Young 2002 bottle: A sleepy berry cream impregnated by a salient red wine acidity...Citric dust settles on the hefty oak barrels...Although the alcohol is masterfully hidden, the barrel seems to have taken away too much of the malt that would have married these flavors with succulence...A drop of vinegar is transported by the heavy carbonation and leaves the tastebuds lingering in expectation of more...A great Flemish Sour experience whose result is still far from that of the past years Stille Nacht Reserva in class, aim, balance and overall togetherness and complexity...A little aging will perhaps help this one...Have to rerate in a year!...3.8/5

3390,"2003-12-15",3.9,"Brown-reddish coloured beer with a small head. Vinous, woody and light sour aroma and taste. Dry bitter tannin aftertaste. This is probably a beer that will just get better and better with age.","Mol, BELGIUM","Kåstå"
3390,"2003-12-14",4.4,"Dark amber to brown color with a smaller head of tan bubbles. Heavy aromas of mild cherries, raisins, single malt, watermelon wine and beaujolais. Aroma becomes softer and more wine like as it warms. Starts with a tannin like bite that leads to a light malt sweetness and rich fruit flavor. Quite spritzy on the palate. This is one to challenge the fine wines. This does have some of the finest balance in a brew that I have had in some time. Tart, sweet, sour, bitter, dry, soft, wow! The finish is a bit like chewing on apple skin, but other things considered...","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
3390,"2003-12-13",4.4,"Aroma is very Flemish Sour like.  Definitely notes of wet wood and sour/tartness.  Quite attractive in the glass, color is light orange brown.  Beer pours with a very big head that is fully retained.  Lots of lacing.  Flavor is quite large.  The big ABV is there, but a lot of other stuff is happening also.  Taste is initally tart, albeit very pleasantly so, the alcohol is also tasted, but this too is a nice sensation.  Also, a faint hint of what I suppose must be the bordeaux wine.  This is very delicious.","Bedford, Texas, USA","TChrome"
3390,"2003-12-12",4.4,"Hazy dark red color,Large head that lasted for quite some time but i was patient since it was a little colder then it should be.Fruity sweet aroma with more smells here then i can put my finger on.The taste was fantastic,Fruit a plenty,berries and possibly apple and pear light malt and a sweet and sour sort of taste.Very nice brew and much better then i was expecting,the brew managed to stay tasty and interesting right to the end where it seemed to go a bit dry and sour,with the fruit still lingering on the pallate.This really makes for a nice trade from Iwantalambic Bud you out did yourself by sending this fine brew Now,can i have another.","Thief River Falls, Minnesota, USA","Slick"
3390,"2003-12-11",3.9,"Thanks to Slob for this unexpected Xmas gift. Appears brown and cloudy at first but with light behind looks a beautiful glowing red color. Head is thick and creamy with good lacing. Aroma is a full one of fruit and malt with raspberries and a sourness also. Alcohol is slightly noticible in the aroma. Mouthfeel is highly charged at first with a crisp and steady carbonation. This mellowed a bit as it warmed some more. This ale covers the glass with a thick lace of foam. The high abv is barely noticable in the flavor. Flavor is quite sour like sour fruit. Interesting and almost like a lambic or gueze. Has a puckering dryness at the finish. Overall enjoyable, I wasn't expecting the sourness but does not detract.","Cape Coral Waterfront Wonderland, Florida, USA","BierBauch"
3390,"2003-12-10",4.0,"I notice the aroma when pouring, very fruity and malty.  Maybe a scent of overripe apples or cider in the background.  The tan colored head was big and made of big bubbles that stayed to the end.  The liquid was a deep red.  Held to the light, it almost looked like a transparent cabernet wine.  The first sip brought a creamy feel, oak and cherry taste, followed by a nice warming feeling. This must come from the 12% abv, which is well hidden.  The finish is a little bitter or sour, which adds to its complexity.  Certainly a beer to drink slowly.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","dperk"

Quickly following is sour fruit,vinous flavors. The sourness really hit before the finish with wet wood. Finish is fairly malty,slightly sour and vinous.

Big mix of sweet and sour, malt cherry, plum, alcohol, chocolate, wood, and some yeast. Flavor is initially sweet and fruity, plum and raisin, with quite a bit of Flemish sour flavors emerging in the middle. Finish was earthy and woody with some alcohol warming, but not much for the 12% abv. Alcohol mellowed as the beer reached room temp and some more grapey and vinous flavors came out. Full body, quite smooth, and decadent. Was rediculously drinkable. Excellent.","Sanborn, New York, USA","IPFreely"
3390,"2003-12-08",3.6,"Hazy light copper w/ a lasting light beige head.  Very rich dark fruit aromas with raisins and currants with a light sourness; bready, yeasty, spicy pepper, faint malt whiskey aroma.  I'm guessing it smells that way due to some higher alcohols that give it a solventy, acetone aroma, and for being conditioned on oak, I only detect a hint of raw oak.  Maybe my sniffer's off, but I just don't get much.  Sweetly malty at the start and sour at the middle and finish.  Dark fruits (raisin, currants) w/ some clove spice yeast flavor;  seems balanced to sour, not sweet or bitter, and there is some fruitiness from alcohol along with some malt flavor;  aftertaste is malt with a faint hop flavor.  Some light astringency in the mouthfeel, highly carbonated probably making the body lighter than actual (feels medium bodied), also has a more than warming but not hot alcohol.  I have mixed feelings about this beer. I like the complexity, but I'm not sure I like that character of it.  It might improve with some age, but I guess I was expecting something less sour.  It's not Flanders Red or Sour Brown sour, but I'm not a big fan of sour beers.  I have a few more bottles that I'll keep around for a while to see how they do.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

3390,"2003-12-02",4.3,"This pours a hazy copper, with red highlights along with a thick tan head. The flavor started making me think that this was a Flemish sour ale, it quickly changed into a fruit explosion. Yes, it has tart overtones, but the flavor and nose are very vinuous.

2002: Thick huge apple spice flavors.  A type of dry white wine palate and flavor.  Tartish and candy like.  A bit sour but nothing really detracting or harsh.  Interesting balance of flavors.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
3390,"2003-12-02",4.4,"When I poured this into the glass, my first impression was dull medium brown. After I poured, the color seemed to change from that dull and boring brown to rubies on worn leather. The head is a dense, small-bubbled foam, like melted french vanilla icecream. It also showed no signs of fading. The wine aroma in this one is stronger than I remember the wine being in the Stille Nacht Reserva. Underneath that is a very estery beer. The flavor is sweet, with the wine still dominating. The very vinuous character is reinforced by the tartness in the finish. Melon, green apples dipped in caramel. Extremely tasty. I really wish I had access to regular Oerbier now to see how different this is. The only problem is that I wonder if the wine may have overwhelmed the beer a bit. Then again, many Belgian strong ales are very winey to start with, in which case the bordeaux casks would have only enhanced what is already there. Regardless, all the flavors work very well together and the tartness gives it a bit of a refreshing quality that makes it that much easier to drink.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

3390,"2003-11-30",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2008 2006 vintage, sampled on 3/31/08: Pours a hazy dark amber ruby with a large, frothy and well-lacing light tan head.  Aroma of tart cherries and vinous oak with a subtle hint of dark caramel malt.  Body starts fairly full and mostly tart with a good complexity of bordeaux oak and vinous flavor.  Still a bit fresh, but should age pretty well.

2002 vintage, rerate on 1/26/07: Murky orange brown pour has a large, airy cream-colored head with thin lacing.  Has a complex oaky, slightly earthy aged malty aroma along with some fruity notes.  Body has lost some of its sweetness and taken on a little more tartness, but is still very flavorful and balanced.  Id say this has aged quite well and should continue to do so for a few more years.

2002 vintage originally sampled on 11/30/03: Copper brown hued with a thick lacey off-white head.  Rich complex aroma of red wine, caramel malt and sour fruits. Body has a good thickness and nice malty, sour oak complexity.  Tart puckering oak finish has a warming effect on the body, but hides the alcohol from the taste buds.  Very nicely aged and quite enjoyable.  Another great beer from De Dolle.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3390,"2003-11-28",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2004 Re-rate 9/26/2004 Murky ruby-copper body, nice tan headthat produces big sheets of lacing. The aroma is oak, wine, plum, and other vinous qualties. Flavor-wise it is brilliant. The red wine characteristics are here, slighlty spicy, very earthy with some almost gueze like notes. Some light hoppiness kicks just before teh swallow, then some alcohol wamrth. Speaking of the alcohol, you would never know this one clocks in at 12%!  As it warms it starts to develop some English barley wine flavors as well as those previously mentioned. Dry palate and a very wine-like finish. I stand by my previous numerical assement. A great beer that is aging like a champ.  11/28/2003 8/4/10/5/18 - 4.5 Wow what a beer! Slightly hazy copper body with a rocky off-white head. The elacing is very nice. Big cherry-oak nose.

3390,"2003-11-25",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 20, 2004 I was lucky enough to purchase a case of this stuff! It comes in a soft wooden crate with the big Oerbier character stamped into the side, very cool cellering vessel!  The beer poured a solid Burnt Sienna brown, maybe a few shades darker with a red tint, there is no seeing through this beer!  A thin, but very active off-white head sizzles on top. The nose is an amazing array of sweet, sour and saltiness, big aroma of oak, some cherry, raspberry, vanilla, smaller hints of horseblanket, orange liquor, and chocolate.  Thin first sip is tangy and acidic, blast of fruity flavors, mostly citric, some sour cherry note and then an incredible woody dryness.  Dryness left over on the front of the tongue is tingly and acidic and alcoholic. This is a massive beer.  As it warms, a grapey, winey flavor is left in place of the burning alcohol.  Every part of the mouth has a part in enjoying this. It's complexities have complexities.   Truly one of the best beers I have ever  enjoyed.  At the end of the glass,  the Flemish Sour attributes are strongest, with only tiny hints of oak or alcohol (how at 12% is this possible??).

 2002 Vintage 
Very dark brown-amber with a red shine, slight haze; thick creamy head. Nose of fresh, ripe brambles, or the same on sherry; thick bramble- or raspberryjam, homemade and covered with white brandy. Intensely fruity. Sour-sweetish taste in the best traditional West-Flemish style. Phenolic, very estery. Fruity, but more like plums or raisins - with a dash of lactic acid. Tart, non-viscous fruit yoghurt? Immensely thick & warming sensation. Very highly saturated (for a barreled beer), alcohol obvious. Just superb - a return to the past, both for DDB as for West-Flemish ales. Kris H. tells me this has been end-fermented with Brettanomyces. I can well believe him, relying on the taste.

 New points for 2006 Vintage
THE BRETTS ARE BACK!!  The nose tells it: last year Brettanomyces was there - but one knew once one was told. Now theres no mistaking any longer. It smells like a super Russian River beer. The taste is just WOOOWW!! The Bretts are back in force, with a musty, mushroom, old wine or port with a gueuze tang; dusty, but juice-bursting deep dark grapes. This vintage is the best so far!

2006 vintage,  special bottling Châteauneuf-du-Pape barrels 
Hazy-brown with orange highlights. Overwhelming nose with wood, vanilla, brandy, dried fruits (as figs, mango, apricots), vinous and cake. Woody, wine, red berries, pineapple with a sweet-sour perfect balance. Viscuous, near chewy, fiery alcoholic and - great. Wow. An exotic version of  Reserva

Thanks to Mike from Bon Vivant and Andrew from Specialty Distributors. Pours a nice copper with a deep red hue. The nose is wonderful! Malt whisky, strong alcohol notes, wood and a hint of vanilla. The taste is much different than I expected. Tart with dominant citrus. Light malt, white grapes and more wood coming through. Tart finish also but somewhat smooth mouthfeel considering this fact. The best part was after my glass was empty. It smelled like fresh cut wood mixed with vanilla. Incredible! Awesome stuff!

Bottle. 2004 vintage. Pours hazed ruby with a fluffy tan head. Nose is awesome! Tart fruits, light wood, wine, yeast, alcohol, light funkiness - pretty much like a Flemish Sour. Taste is very much the same as well. Tart fruits (some citric acidity along with it), wine, grapes, wood notes, big yeast flavors, alcohol, candied fruitiness underneath and an almost Sour Patch Kid-like flavor as well. Body is spritzy and tart with a mild dryness and acidity. Finishes  very well indeed. Lingering alcohol and a sour grape and raspberry note with wood, and cady notes. Very nice.
