957,"2016-09-12",3.6,"Bottle... Hazy burnt-orange pour with a small, fizzy, white collar. The aroma features loads of berries accompanied by an unobtrusive, woodsy funk. Full-bodied with zippy carbonation. The flavor is moderately sour and fruity with a small splash of red wine vinegar. Bottle courtesy of 50belair!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
957,"2016-05-01",3.9,"Bottle thanks to Chris. Pours a hazy ruby orange with small frothy white head that lasts. The aroma is funky oak, cherry skin, funk. Thick mouth, oak, funky, tart, very good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
957,"2015-12-01",3.5,"Bottle. Clear reddish brown pour with a white head. Mild currant bouquet. Tangy black currant and then nothing else. One dimensional, thin, & flaccid","Florida, USA","50belair"
957,"2015-11-30",3.5,"750 mL bottle. Red body. Medium khaki head. Belgian yeast aroma. Currants and dark fruits. Oak and light acidity. Taste is lightly tart currant flavor. Some Belgian yeast and maltiness. Oak and acidity. Simple. Well carbonated. Its not a real complex beer, but its decent.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
957,"2015-11-02",4.3,"huge thanks to Drew for this one, Amazing beer. Top of the night and there was nothing but the very best here. Aamzing tart raisin flavors, complex grainy malts, moderate body and medium mouthfeel.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
957,"2015-09-14",4.2,"750 ml 2014 bottle generously shared by a friend visiting from California, thanks Ed! Murky dark ruby red with a finger of off-white head. Aromas of raspberries, berries, light funk and vinegar. Tastes of raspberries, berries, funk, oak, light vinegar and tart acidic notes. Light body with a dry finish. Fantastic stuff.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"
957,"2015-08-05",4.4,"Poured from a bottle. 
Aroma is fairly fruity with some really nice currant notes. Some medium light acidity with hints of citrus and tropical fruit. Light oak and wine notes. 
Pours a hazy reddish color with some light brown hues and a medium sized, fairly thick, slightly pinkish tan head that exhibits nice retention. Medium lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is moderately tart with some nice fruit notes from the yeast contributing berries and cherries. Medium light tannins with some medium light bitterness. Moderate currant notes with some light oak character. Hints of caramel and toasted bread. Light tropical fruit and stone fruit notes as well. Light alcohol spice and mineral notes with a nice, dry finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, this might be my favorite fruited beer that SARA released to the club in 2014 (sorry Westly). The fruit works really well with the malt in the base beer and the yeast qualities.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
957,"2015-06-05",4.3,"Bottle shared by ygtbsm94. Thanks Brad.

Ruby pink body with a thin light pinkish collar. Beautiful aroma of oak, must, fruit, yeast. Berries and oak. Tannic and yeasty. Mild acetic finish. Outstanding.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
957,"2015-03-22",4.6,"Deep pink in color, holding a firm head of persistent fine white foam. Fairly clear, slight haze. Spritzy in feel but with a creamy edge. Aromas of berry, fresh wood, lacto driven, raspberry emerges, bit of salt and chalk. Lightly to medium tart. Big thanks to Edgar Hops for sharing. This is a stellar beverage.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
957,"2015-03-22",4.3,"Guava color with pinkish white head. Soft fruity aroma, juicy currant and raspberry. Flavor is impressive, such nice currant, not devolving into raisin like other currant beers. Bright and tart, not even that sour but perfectly yogurty.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
957,"2015-02-17",4.3,"A few bottles throughout the months and a draft pour at Good Karma during SF Beer Week. Aroma is heavy on the dusty/yeasty/eggy funk with lots of acidic raspberry, dark grape, dark sugars, lemons and oak. So much more fruit and funk complexities coming from the draft pour than the bottle. The beer pours yeasty/murky pale red/pink with heavy pink head that sticks around for most of the glass. The taste is mega tart, with lots of funky berries, dusty, lemons, light jam sweetness, light acid, red wine and oak. The body is medium-full, creamy, with medium carbonation and a funky/sour finish. After taste are berry skins and barnyard funk. Fuck this is awesome. Im going to agree with bytemesis and say this is pretty close to a Cantillon Lou Pepe. This is an excellent SARA Cellar offering with a little bit of age.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
957,"2015-02-10",4.3,"UPDATED: FEB 17, 2015 Tap at good karma. Pours cloudy pink, large puffy pink head, dissipates slowly, nice lacing. Aroma is strong raspberry, funk, basement, horse blanket, dusty, lemon, stems. Flavor is light tart, medium funk, Cantillon like - very reminiscent of a Lou Pepe Framboise - a little less funky perhaps. Mineral mouthfeel. Light body, soft carbonation.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
957,"2015-02-10",4.1,"Another beer week goody! Nice cherry cider red pour with low white tight bubbled head. Such a nice fruity Sante buggy nose. Yeasty and egg funky with a red fruit lilt. Very Sante. Tart up front, with a flat slick middle to a fruity sweet end. Sante BA saison style goodness. Yeasty, funky, buggy up front. The palate is a sweet jammy red fruity with a white grape notes. The end is oaky, buttery and simple grape jelly. Fantastic fruited sour.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
