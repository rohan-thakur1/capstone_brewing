2948,"2014-08-08",3.8,"Pours hazy yellow with a small white head that leaves quickly. The aroma has has dry apples, woodiness, bark, wild yeastiness, must and grassiness. Has a very rustic outdoorsy type quality to it. It starts off with a slick smoothness, but then has a crispness to it and a hint of carbonation even though everything seems like it is a still cider otherwise. Starts off with woodiness, spiciness, dry apples, tannic qualities and a mustiness that is somehow also crisp. The finish has wild ale tartness, clean apple and citric notes. Im becoming quite sold on Spanish ciders being the best out there.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
2948,"2014-05-30",4.0,"Hazy straw gold pour with almost no head and a moderate effervescence. Aroma is barnyard funk, ground spoiled tart apple funk, earthy, green wood and a hint of under ripe berries. Flavor is bretty funk up front, horse blanket, some band aid, some interesting aged floral notes, tart berries, a hint of light wood and dried stalky plant smoke, tart apple, wet basement and some wildflower floral notes. Light body with a neutral to off dry feel on entry leading to a slightly acidic, lightly carbonated feel in the middle and dry, slightly acidic and slightly chalky finish. Really, really tasty stuff overall, nice, funky, tart and quaffable profile. A more aerated pour seems to really open up the fruity and floral aspects and the last pour, with the sediment, seems fruitier, but less funky. Almost certainly the most interesting cider I have had so far.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"
