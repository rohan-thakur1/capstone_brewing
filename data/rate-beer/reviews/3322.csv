3322,"2015-04-05",3.4,"Dubbed an ¬íIndia pale lager¬í, this is apparently a pale lager hopped in the same way as an IPA - which makes me wonder how this can be classified as a Zwickelbier, Kellerbier or Landbier, I¬íd rather place it under the new wave of hoppy ¬íboutique Pilseners¬í, to quote Martyn Cornell... Anyway, it shows a pretty, clear, deep ¬íold gold¬í colour with quiet sparkling, under an irregularly structured, lightly lacing, egg-white head. Adding the deposit makes it completely hazy, I¬ím beginning to see the resemblance with a Kellerbier after all...  Aroma has lots of citrussy hops, with impressions of mandarin, lemon zest, pink grapefruit flesh, bitter honey, hemp, white grape peel, tulips, white pepper, something faintly buttery and bread dough. Taste begins with a kind of ¬ímalt fruitiness¬í, subduedly sweetish, minerally and slightly buttery, a bit metallic, with spicy hops creeping in already and increasing towards the finish, supported by a straightforward pale malt sweetishness, a little bit bready; the citrussy, spicy and leafy, fairly complex hop bitterness persists for quite a long time, drying the throat but still remaining relatively gentle. Very quenching and in any case more interesting than the regular pale lagers of Gulpener or any other Dutch brewery. Still, I miss the yeasty fruitiness of a top-fermented IPA so I am still unsure whether these new ¬íIPLs¬í, if they are to be considered as a subgenre of Pilsener or pale lager, really add something new to the world of beer styles...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

3322,"2014-06-07",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2015 Bottled from local supermarket. Slightly hazy golden colored, white head. Hoppy nose, grainy, keller-like, quite ¬íGerman¬í. Hoppy flavor, bitterness with quite some malty backbone, hay, medium to thick body. I¬ím pretty impressed, this is a very tasteful yet easy to drink beer. And it¬ís available in almost every supermarket. Did not expect such a quality brew from such a (relatively) big brewery, although they do produce some other fine brews (Chateau Neubourg and especially Mesteechs Aajt). Ranks high among my favorite session beers. Keep up the good work guys!","Bussum, NETHERLANDS","jerohen"

This was much better then expected. Was served at ""Happen met een bier in Hoogeveen"" incombination with apserges and a sauce with musard and dill.
Which worked very nicely good stuff at the Lekkernije.

Good brew from Gulpener, I ill pick this up once more.
(Good alternative to promote more hoppy beers in a easy good way.)","Hoogeveen, NETHERLANDS","RW80"
3322,"2014-06-02",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2015 30cl Bottle from AH. Hazy golden yellow colour, white head. Aroma of bread, unmalted barley, some wort, grassy and light-spicy hops. Flavour is medium-sweet, malty, bread, barley, honey, some lemon, decent grassy hoppy bitter finish with a hint of herbal bitterness. Light-bodied. Nice. 747314 Re-rate: had this a few times now, also from tap, and it¬ís just a really good beer. They call it an IPL now, but that¬ís just surfing on the IPA-hype. Whatever. Tap version is even more hoppy and honey-ish. 848316","Zaandam, NETHERLANDS","Borresteijn"
3322,"2014-05-31",3.3,"Hazy light amber with big fluffy white head. Medum malty with slight toasted note, grapefruit, lime peel, lots of herbal notes. Taste is light sweetness with medium bitter kicking in halfway and slighty dry bitter finish. Medium bodied. Pretty decent stuff, this is actually hoppy unlike most other major ""hoppy"" beers. Nothing too exciting but the best Gulpener beer I¬íve ever had.","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","Maakun"

In the aroma tones of citrus, flowers, hops and some tropical fruits. The taste is fruity and hoppy, is a little sweet and nice medium bitter. The finish is dry and hoppy. Finally, I real good beer from Gulpener, about time.","Leerdam, NETHERLANDS","bonkiedeaap"
3322,"2014-05-29",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2014 Bottled from Mitra Bunnik, BB Nov 14, large sample, served in a shaker. Pours a slight hazy golden color, medium frothy slight off-white head. Aroma of quite some noble hop, slight spicy, bit grassy, slight grainy. Medium bitter in taste, some hay and grass. Lots of marketing nonsense on the label, but the beer itself is wonderful and doesnt match with the corny label. Lovely german styled classic.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
