2023,"2014-09-23",4.3,"""My favorite beer of Canfest 2012 (went back 3 times!). dark amber/red-brown in color. Thinking more india brown ale than brown ale. What Oskar Blues can do with a single hop (think Gubna) is nothing short of amazing. THE best brown ale Ive ever had...knocking off DFH Indian Brown, which is similar, but this is bigger, baddder and resher. The hop spice and roasted malt assault is great!! Hope to see this again. Soooo close to a 4.4 - probably will coem back and change it :)""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

Very hop forward Brown ale. Pine and earthy hops upfront with some moderate roasted notes in the center. Light chocolate and burnt nuts gives the brew a nice balance of the blast of hops in the front end. The finish shows herbal hop notes with a decent amount of pine resin. The body is medium with the carbonation giving a mild creaminess to it. The drinkability is really high for a brown. I could drink more of this and for me I could session at 7%.

Mouthfeel is not too heavy for a 7% brown ale, but has an appropriate enough weight to it. The finish lets a good hoppiness come through.

2023,"2012-12-11",3.9,"Can from Bine & Vine. Pours fairly dark brown with a slight beige head. Theres a roast malt aroma but the pine/citrus is dominant. Maybe even just citrus cause its sort of cat pee. Med body minus. Theres ""brown"" malt, but the hop is definitely cat pee. Its not harsh. Its just cat pee. Damn but it finishes not quite smoothly bitter, and leaves the mouth lightly coated with ...","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
2023,"2012-12-10",3.9,"Can poured a clear dark reddish brown with a small lingering tan head. Aromas of carmel, earthiness, pine, grapefruit and skunk bud. Palate was medium bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of carmel, cocoa, grapefruitr, skunk bud, pine and roastiness with a smooth dry lingering roasty finish.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
2023,"2012-12-08",3.7,"Can. Poured dark brown color with an average frothy white head that lasted and produced fair lacing. Moderate to heavy complex toasted malt and earthy hop aroma. Medium body with a slick texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy bittersweet flavor with a solid bittersweet finish of moderate duration. This is a solid complex beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"

The novelty factor of this beer is in the packaging. Maybe that explains the rather high $4.99 price point that has been a turnoff for a while. Thankfully tastybeer was brave enough to pick one up. With a bite that does not like up to the bark I would say this would be a much better beer at the typical $2.99 charged for other Sun King releases.

Aroma / Appearance - A fluid brown base bubbles like melted chocolate simmering in a sauce pan. Noble hops, creamy bakers chocolate, and malts carry an aggressive presences that lives up to the description on the side of the can.

Flavor / Palate - Unfortunately this is where things fall apart. Chocolate truffles and earthy hops are not bad. They just feel kind of meh after the second sip. Check it out if you wish but otherwise save some money and get Osiris instead.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

2023,"2012-11-12",4.0,"""Sport-Drink"" style pint-can:
Deep brown with tall, tan head.
Scent is...pine resin...of unexpected strength...
This is a different breed, for sure.....
An IPA/Brown mix.
The brown contributes malt and dark bitters, while the IPA aspects impart strong herbals....and a predominate hop bitter throughout.
High ""WOW"" points for unexpected sensations.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
2023,"2012-11-04",2.9,"Can. Deep brown body with ruby highlights. Frothy beige head. Light aroma of roasted malts, resin hops. The flavor is moderately sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. It finishes lightly sweet and moderately bitter, a bitterness that carries long into the finish. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation. Taste of raw, resinous hops atop roasted malts. Ash and burnt malts in finish. An ashy, bitter roasted malt brown ale thats hopped up like a resin-bomb IPA. And its expensive.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
2023,"2012-10-28",4.6,"Pint can poured into an imperial pint glass. First off, just let me say that this can is the coolest looking can I have ever seen! Aluminum can shaped more like a sports drink bottle with a wide mouth (think Mickeys Big Mouth). Great idea for bottling. Pours a dark brown with almost a reddish hue and a small light tan head and a lot of lacing. The hops aroma almost bowls you over upon opening. Very fresh, earthy and floral. Also picking up a decent amount of malts in the aroma, but the hops own this. Smells more like an IIPA. Taste is definitely very different from any other beers I can remember tasting, but that is a good thing. Hops and malt dominate the taste, but both are very well balanced together with neither dominating. But both are STRONG! The hops have a very nice citrusy taste, and the malts are very roasty, with a bit of chocolate on the back end. Very clean, crisp, and dare I say refreshing! Finish is slightly bitter with a long, lingering malt and hops taste. Excellent on the palate! Seriously one of the best balanced beers I have ever had! Nice full body, thick texture, active carbonation. Amazing, wonderful beer here! So sad that this is not going to be around longer. This one definitely has potential to be a 99%er.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","jhp40219"
2023,"2012-10-27",3.8,"Pours brown with a creamy beige head.  Nice lacing.  Grapefruit, over-ripe oranges, hazelnut, mocha, coffee, and an earthy dankness.  Smooth nutty brown ale with an aggressive hop kick.  Medium body and carbonation with a smooth creamy mouthfeel.  Interesting and unique brown ale... Definitely worth a try.","Indiana, USA","Jethro6191"
2023,"2012-10-12",3.6,"Clearish deep dark chestnut with a good sized and persistent light khaki head. Very nice aroma of floral and herbal sticky hops, with a sweet malty backbone of cocoa and caramel creaminess. The flavor was nice and full with earthy brown maltiness, light light cocoa tones, strong dry hopped grassy tones and bitter grapefruit, finishing somewhat roasty and pine-resinous.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
