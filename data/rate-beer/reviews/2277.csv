2277,"2017-05-10",3.5,"Data butelkowania:  30.11.2016 
 Kolor:  Miedziany z czerwonymi refleksami. Mocne zamglenie na całej powierzchni szkła. 
 Piana:  Żółta praktycznie o każdej możliwej strukturze. Najpierw drobna, potem pęka do dużych i średnich baniek, aby na koniec zredukować się do milimetrowej obrączki. 
Całkiem okazałe wzorki na szkle. 
 Zapach:  Aromat jest mało intensywny. Trzeba się bardzo natrudzić, żeby w ogóle cokolwiek tutaj wywąchać. Górują w nim słody. Mało wyraźne nuty korzenne pomieszane z wysoką przyprawowością.
Jest też sporo belgijskich drożdży.
Mało owocowych akcentów, praktycznie w ogóle.
Delikatny karmel w tle. 
 Smak:  W smaku solidnie przyprawowe i korzenne na zmianę. Mamy tutaj sporo nut goździków, gałki muszkatowej i pieprzu.
Delikatny karmel miesza się z akcentami ziemistymi i nutami ciemnego chleba.
Piwo jest solidnie gorzkie, co tak na prawdę jest nowością jak dla mnie w tym stylu.
Opisanych na etykiecie nut czekoladowych nie odnajduje tutaj wcale. Dostrzegam za to nieźle ułożony alkohol.
Piwo jest bardzo oryginalne jak na swój styl, zupełnie niespotykane jak do tej pory.
Teksturę ma całkiem fajną, chociaż daleką od oleistego trunku. 
Czy mi smakuje? Trudno to określić...Raz tak, raz nie. 
 Wysycenie:  Średnie, a nawet wysokie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Jeden z najbardziej oryginalnych i kontrowersyjnych Quadów jakie piłem. Naszprycowany nutami przyprawowymi (goździki, pieprz, gałka muszkatołowa).
Mocno korzenny, ziemisty i tylko z lekkim przełamaniem karmelowym. Wspaniale ukryty alkohol. Brakuje mi w nim nut owocowych i odrobiny więcej słodyczy.
Dla poszukiwaczy ciekawych wersji tego stylu może być nie lada gadką :)","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

- Je suis partial aux bières d'inspiration belges et celle-ci est très fidèle au style. Bien faite, facile à boire pour une bière au-dessus de 10%, les moines seraient fiers de celle-là.

2277,"2016-02-01",3.7,"341ml bottle. Opaque, darkest brown colour with late awakening, small, creamy, diminishing, moderately lacing, beige head - a thin beige layer remains throughout. Slightly ""boozy"" and vinous aroma at distance, close-by notes of dried fruit, plum, raisin, fig, hints of oat flakes on apple purée, blue grapes. Taste is sweet, heavy malty, notes of toffee, some honey, treacle, dried fruit, raisin, fig, blue grapes, plum; full body, oily texture, soft and slightly sticky palate.

2277,"2016-01-21",3.9,"BOD 1/15, so this has had a year to age. Mahogany brown pour with suspended particulate matter. Outstanding head volume, normal lacing and retention.

Light, but typical Quad nose. Caramel, toffee, subtle charred grain, raisin, light prune, fig and chocolate hints over a sweet background.

Medium body with a semi-slick oily texture. World class carbonation for the style with a burst of effervescence in the middle and a solid prickly finish.

The outstanding flavor profile is intense, very complex and fairly balanced. The alcohol adds a bit of astringency, but the flavor is hidden well. It does makes it presence well known with the burn at the back of the throat. All flavors from the nose make an appearance. The sweeter ones arrive first and by the middle the malt sweetness is at its maximum. From the middle on, the prune and charred characteristics are most prevalent coupled with a slight astringency. Chocolate and toffee appear just before the finish. The finish is a slow warm fade of astringent prune with a subtle sweetness underneath.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

2277,"2015-03-02",2.3,"11.5 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at approximately 40 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a clearish yet dark ruby amber, which forms no head beyond a patchy cap and a ring of white. A few scattered streams of bubbles make their way steadily to the top of the beer.

Smell: Sweet toffee and caramel malt dominates the aroma, carrying a bit of candi sweetness along for the ride. Theres something akin to cranberry drifting through the scent as well.

Taste: Right up front, this is a barrage of caramel, toffee, and candi sugar, and that does not relent through most of the tasting process. The ABV is boldly present as both heat and astringency, providing something of a medicinal taste and a lingering burn on the tongue. Hints of chocolate and something vaguely fruity are present, but buried under the sweetness and alcohol bite. There is a pronounced peppery spice, however, which makes itself known alongside the alcohol.

Mouthfeel: Sharp and hot, this is creamy while in the mouth, and then leaves a sensation not unlike drinking sandpaper.

Overall: Im uncertain if perhaps I got hold of a bad bottle, or if Ive been spoiled by other large ABV beers that conceal their payload, but this would not be a repeater for me. I am generally a fan of sweeter beers, but the heat and medicinal tinge taint the whole flavor profile for me.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Pours a dark brown robe with caramel highlights topped by a finger of lightly tanned head. Retention is moderate and lacing is rough and spotted.

The nose will give caramel, prunes, banana and a touch of smoke. You do spot some raosted malts and a certain alcohol vapor.

On the tongue, you get smooth roasted malts with some sweet cherries and spices. A strong wrapping bitterness engulfs everything in a very long finish. Mouthfeel is very dense and oily bearing quite a sharp attack.

This Abt is caramel from start to finish. The density is enjoyable and its overall very staisfying. ABV is a bit traiterous but being the Abt fan I am, I cant say I didnt enjoy it.

Very little bitterness, this beer has intense malty and sweet flavours, mixed with the taste of chocolate and caramel. It presents complex red fruit and spice flavours due to the type of yeast that is used during the brewing process. This beer is at its best only after it has aged for six months. The Rigor Mortis are complex beers designed and brewed with patience and care in the tradition of the great Belgian Abbey beers.Rigor Mortis Abt is brewed only once a year, and is sold in April until stocks last.

2277,"2014-06-06",3.6,"Pours the typical murky, quad colour. Nothing unusual, but rates well for good lacing. 

Smells a lot more wine-like than other ABT quads, some yeast and spice, some dark fruit too. 

Typical quad flavours with a bit more cherry wine and dry apricot sweetness and molasses interplaying with more bitterness than usual. Toasted toffee malt flavours. Less complex than others. Dry apricot aftertaste in the mouth. 

Fair bit of carbonation on the mouth, but it pulls away to leave a silkier aftertaste that starts with sweet brown sugar and evaporates into dry fruit. 

Worth trying. The cherry taste is new, but doesn't reach the dizzying heights if the best quads. B-

2277,"2013-07-07",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 30, 2014 Bière brune aux reflets rouge, totalement voilée avec quelques particules en suspension, bonne effervescence, col brunâtre plutôt mince mais résistant. Arômes principalement maltés, pain grillé, toutes sortes dodeurs sucrés (caramel, cassonade, mélasse, sucre brut), petits fruits foncés très mûres (prunes, cerises, raisins, mûres), avec certains effluves rappelant davantage le grain rôti, la torréfaction, le chocolat, voire même le malt fumé avec certaines notes de bacon, viande fumée, poisson fumé même. Lalcool est également présent au nez, ainsi que certaines traces plus herbacées. Le nez est agréable, très complexe, il manque peut-être un peu dintensité cependant. En bouche, ce nest pas très pétillant, légèrement mousseux, mais lonctuosité au palais est très intéressante, cest rond et soyeux. Au goût, comme le nez laissait présager, cest bien malté, pain grillé, abondantes saveurs sucrées, petits fruits foncés très mûres. Mais ce nest pas nécessairement très sucré en bouche, principalement parce quon y retrouve beaucoup dalcool, peut-être un peu trop, quoique ça reste très bien intégré tout de même. On retrouve également un léger houblon herbacé qui prend surtout place en fin de bouche apportant alors une finale à lamertume légère mais bien sentie qui donne à cette bière un équilibre très bien réussi. ///// Le vieillissement est véritablement bénéfique à cette bière! Dailleurs, le brasseur lui-même suggère sur létiquette un vieillissement dau moins 6 mois. Je peux dire quaprès 14 mois de vieillissement, le breuvage devient merveilleusement corpulent, merveilleusement rond en bouche, les petits fruits foncés très mûrs deviennent explosifs au goût, la torréfaction, le chocolat noir, se rajoute aux saveurs sucrées, et lalcool devient moins goûteux, tout en nous envahissant toujours les joues de sa réconfortante chaleur. Lintégration des saveurs entre elles devient presque parfaite, et la bière ne perd rien de son équilibre très bien réussi.

The basement is very dark (where we sat anyway), so I had trouble seeing the true colour of the beer: it looked dark brown though. The bottle label being dark also was almost unseeable too, which is a shame because the art work is lovely.

The smell told me however I had a great beer in front of me, even if I couldnt see it too well. Malty molasses and rich fruit esters filled my nose and I couldnt wait to taste it.

The richness of the flavours exploded in my mouth, sweet malty molasses (like the aroma) with hints of toffee, caramel and chocolate. Add dark fruit and yeastiness into the mix and you have a very tasty beer indeed.

2277,"2012-05-23",3.2,"UPDATED: OCT 6, 2014 Cola brown, hazy translucent, tan film of head.  Smells of astringent grass, hints of sweet caramel.  Body is thin and bubbly, slightly boozy, a spicy but not over-the-top yeast contribution.  Although there was no explosion upon opening, I believe this beer has gone bad... the second time this has happened from the same vendor.  Some redeeming attributes come through in the aftertaste, but overall its a pretty big disappointment (particularly in the aroma.)   ... yeah, thats real shame, Ive been looking forward to trying this beer for a long time.  I am dumping about 90% of this beer :(  Im giving it a 12 for overall impression because I think it would be good if not mistreated/infected (the former is more likely given the lack of over carbonation)

UPDATE (2 yrs later): Muddy warm brown-red, thin fine tan head, aroma of apple, raisin, and brown sugar.  Flavor: apple, brown sugar, raisin, and astringent bitter aftertaste.  What is it with this beer. I think this is the intended flavor, but I suspect its just not a match for my palate.  Light body, medium, smooth carbonation.

2277,"2011-10-03",3.6,"Review ported from BA

Appearance:
Wow, no head on this at all. It attempted to foam a bit, but really just didnt happen. The color is a misty, translucent brown which reminds me of pretty much every lighter brown ale Ive ever seen.

Smell:
Bready maltiness is what Im really getting here. Banana notes have a moderate presence, with no hops aroma. Its not a complex smell, but it feels fitting of the beer.

Taste:
heavy banana bread taste and possible oatmeal flavor. Toasted malts give it a complexity which I didnt expect from the smell. Semi-sweet, with just a tinge of hops. A bit of alcohol heat to it, but not so much as to overpower the other flavors.

Mouthfeel:
Very heavy, very full. Medium-low carbonation. Has kind of an oily texture. Reminds me kind of how 120 minute IPA feels, strangely enough.

Overall:
This is an interesting beer, and I can certainly enjoy it. Its a solid offering from a brewery which creates quite a few very good beers.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

Mouthfeel is slightly syrupy, a full palate for sure, with soft carbonation. Its delicious and I never would have guessed it came from north of the border.

Like peering into deep, murky water. The nose = wow! Intense smells of chocolate and caramel malt. Very sweet. Also, hints of cherry/plum are easy to pick out. Little hits of yeast and even less so of alcohol. Lacing is similar to a spiders web. Head was 1.5 fingers high and off white/light brown. Flavor is heavy in fruit (banana, raisin) in the forefront and pleasantly sweet. The malt characteristics also come through quite nicely, with caramel being the most present. The alcohol comes through like a crescendo, starting small and then finishing strong when a good size gulp is had. Reminds me of wasabi.

Malted grains are also slightly too prominent. Also, berries, cherries, molasses, and light brown sugar. The body is also a bit hot, lightly yeasty, and heavy malt dominated. Light scotch up front and some light brown sugar mixed spices. More buttery molasses cookies and fruit through the middle, becoming more sugary in the finish. Not overly sweet or rich however. Overall, this probably needed to sit for several more months, as I expect some more complexities would show themselves.

Aroma is dark fruits, particularly strong on the raisins along with some prunes, figs and black currants, yeast & bread, some caramel, toffee, brown sugar, and a touch of oxidation probably due to the fact that Dieu du Ciel is using screw-tops on their beers.  Very good to excellent strength.

2277,"2011-01-31",4.8,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 11.2oz bottle into a tulip glass. Info on the label includes its abv (10.5%) and a nice description of the beer.

Appearance: This beer has a dark murky body with some lighter mahogany and reddish brown highlights. From the pour I got a thin creamy off head. The small head quickly fades to a light film covering with a ring of foam at the edge of the glass. Lacing is slick and slides right down the glass.

Smell: It has a big fruity/estery aroma with hints of dark dried fruits like raisins and plum or prune. There are also notes of yeast and sweet bready/toasty almost chocolaty malt and as it warms I get some cherry notes too, along with mellow hints of its big 10.5% abv.

Taste/Palate: It starts with its good sweet malty base and then adds fruity and yeast notes to the mix. Everything from the aroma is picked up here and slowly fades off the tongue with some mellow peppery/spicy hops and boozy alcohol. Its full bodied and finely carbonated, which I feel is perfect for the style.

Hazy reddish-brown body with small, but thick and persistent head of beige foam.
Mellow sort of aroma, that certainly seems to have rich potential; treacle, clove, dried and dark fruits, alcohol.
Texture is beautifully thick and silky. Medium carbonation with tremendous length.
Seriously intensly rich flavour; lots of berry fruits, plum, mollasses, fig, sultana, almost Christmas cake like. Finish is spicy, with a hint of phenolic bitterness and plenty of warming brandy-like booziness.
Very rich, sweet Belgian ale with plenty of flavour, and alcohol. Certainly has the complexity, but missing the finesse that makes a great Belgian into an extraordinary Belgian.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

The taste is very complex, and alcohol like port is right up front...a little too much, but the finish is long and the alcohol flavors disspates through the finish.  Flavors of toffee, bread, and cocoa are noted.  Palate is full body, creamy with soft carbonation and a long finish.

2277,"2010-09-26",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2016 ***re-review Oct 13, 2016 - last bottle from my 2009 or 2010 stash***

Dammit if this isnt still really good albeit showing some oxidation. This bottle basically has not moved in 6 years with almost zero temperature variance while remaining in total darkness. Its from the same batch as the original review. 
Still holds on to its former sweet aromatic nature, with the brown sugar ruling, chocolate and raisins holding solid. Slightest of the cardboard but it only adds to the awesomeness and long lasting complexity. The taste has improved with the harshness of the alcohol and sharpness mellowing out with dementia of old age. The yeast has held up to a higher level than expected, molasses, caramel etc still holding strong minus the raisins. The alcohol still exists along with a bit of sharpness and spice. Has a bit of dryness. Not much improvement on the taste as the changes for the better and worse have seemingly cancelled the effects of each other out. Now that is how one correctly cellars a beer! Well worth the wait if not just to enjoy it once again. ****
Original review: 9/26/2010
Rich brown brew with a very nice light brown creamy solid cap leaving permanent lacing. Great aroma - sweet and powerful. Loads of brown sugar, molasses, caramel, plum, spices (nutmeg, licorice), faint wood, light earthiness, candied orange rind. Taste: burnt sugar, dulling yeast feel, raisins, chocolate (cool!) - I get this on every sip, sugar, intense sharp aftertaste. alcohol, candy (???which???). Too much alcohol peered at me so I think my other bottles will sit for a year +. Alcoholic bit in the middle gives way to light bitterness and an odd chocolate / plum / burnt sugar aftertaste. Decent brew but not a fave mainly due to the alcohol (which came out strong after I let this sit in my glass).","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"
2277,"2010-09-26",4.6,"Looks amazing in a goblet with a thick viscous head that slides effortlessly down the sides of the glass, carried by a strong alcohol current. Tawny cloudy brown with a strong raisiny brown sugar aroma, the round mouthfeel is enough to wow you on its own. Starts slightly tart with a thick sweetness that is quickly tempered by a slight earthy bitterness. The sweetness returns quickly though and lasts long into the aftertaste with the alcohol burn only creeping in at the very end. Spicy cinnamon and black pepper appears mid swallow. Heavy handed; but in a good way.","Thomasville, North Carolina, USA","freekyp"

2277,"2010-09-24",4.2,"Bottle (2009) and served in my other Unibroue tulip: Brownish hue with amber, purple and coppery highlights topped by a small but lasting head and left spotty lace upon the glass, some oily legs. The aroma has notes of dark candi sugar syrup, plum pudding, prune juice, apricot jam, marizpan, stinging alcohol, earthy minerals and some peaty like smoke, clove, white pepper, and woody finesse. Smells like a a Wee Heavy meets a Abbey Ale, and I like it!  The taste starts with heavy layers of sweet malt sugars, some candied fruit twang and a sharp alcohol and spicy character that kept it from becoming cloy and overbearing. The constant earthy tones added complexity and roundness. This is a full forced reminder of the best of the Abbey Strong Ales but as a character that I will once again described as something more akin to a Wee Heavy or Scotch Ale I found intriguing. The mouth feel is full bodied and aggressive with a woody finish. This is the 2nd or 3rd Dieu du Ciel I found to be wonderful and slightly twisted surprising, I love it and recommend you age some for yourself.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
2277,"2010-09-22",3.9,"The beer pours a medium to dark amber with a small beige head.  The creamy bubbles faded quickly, but its still a nice looking beer.  The aroma has a fair bit of booze but also lots of complexity with notes of brown sugar, toffee, raisins, rum, peaches, mint, grapes and warm bread.  The taste also has a good deal of booze and is a mite sticky sweet, but the sugary malt flavors are terribly pleasant and the alcohol provides happy warmth.  The finish has some mild bitterness, not really enough to rein in the sweetness but who cares when the flavor is this nice?  Mouthfeel is smooth, full and somewhat sticky.  Carbonation is relativley low, likely exacerbated by the age of the bottle (twist-offs?  how do they work?).","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

The head fades to a thin remnant but leaves a small amount of fine lace as it does. The nose is complex and quite inviting. Beautiful aromas of caramel, chocolate, candi sugar and port, along with alcohol, fruit, flowers, yeast, vanilla and some spice. The flavour is driven by complex malts: medium sweet throughout with a tiny hint of hops and a good dose of alcohol. The finish is long and malty. On the palate, this beer is medium-full in body with a smooth, creamy texture and soft carbonation with fine bubbles. Overall, this is an amazing abt, definitely one to be savoured. It is well assembled and it is hard to believe it weighs in at 10.5% ABV. The malts are elegant and complex.

Bristling rich and fresh sugars, a bit of perceived candied cherries, and some saccharin-heavy milk chocolate sauce. Boozy and brave. Aggregated pilsner malt minerals.

Not a whole lot of yeast on the nose, making it smell like this wont be as smooth and round as I like for an Abt.  The flavor is actually pretty soft and well rounded though.  Intense dark fruits with burnt toffee and caramel up front.  The finish is a bit harder though, and the one thing that I dont like about this is that its very hot and alcoholic.  I never get this much alcohol flavor from a Rochefort or Westy.  It really affects the overall enjoyment and drinkability.  Full bodied with a fairly chewy texture up front, but the heavy alcohol thins it out on the finish.

The taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some bananas, spice, cherries, and some nuts.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its a bit coating, rich, and is well carbonated.  Drinkability is decent enough, the 10.5% ABV isnt as strong in the taste as you think it would be, but you can feel it after a little while.

2277,"2010-02-20",3.9,"Sampled October 2009
A solid pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet glass produces a three finger thick, lightly amber tinged, tan colored head.  The beer is a concentrated, burnt amber color that shows a lightly hazed, deep plum red color when held up to the light.  The aroma is not anywhere near the sweetness I was expecting.  My second smell of this though has me noticing lots of rich fruit aromatics that definitely have some sweetness to them.  Notes of raisins and figs are quite prominent and there is a touch of hot alcohol towards the finish.  A rich maltiness mixes with the dark fruit, contributing a deeply caramelized malt sugar note as well as some subtle toasted grain character towards the end.  A touch of aromatics that make me think of freshly fermenting plums.  Further inspection yields ample spicy clove notes, a touch of white pepper, some woody allspice,  .  At times the beer comes off as being savory, despite the fruity and sweet spice notes.  This definitely has a complex, well integrated nose; one that is clearly world class.

Somewhat sweet tasting, though not overly so, the palate is immediately engulfed by a rich fruitiness that is only slightly wiped clean in the finish by some hot alcohol spiciness.  Fruity, with a rich sweetness and even a savory malt backbone, this beer has a lot of things going on.  There is quite a bit of spice character here, though it is not more than soft and is definitely well integrated; some lightly tongue numbing clove, an allspice note, some woody black pepper and an almost oaky spiciness (it has a definite woodiness to it somehow).  For some reason the flavor isnt as impressive as the aroma, though this is still quite good.  While this is rich and somewhat thick, the beer is not overly heavy; despite its strength it has a certain drinkability that is requisite of the style.

This is a pretty nice beer, the biggest flaw is that the alcohol can be a bit too noticeable at times; it doesnt ruin the beer for me though.  Interesting, this might be quite phenomenal if not for the hot alcohol; I wish I had bought a second bottle to age a bit longer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2277,"2009-11-10",3.7,"Heavy nose of sugars, butter caramel and candy for this light brown ABT. Thick body, very sweet, lots of caramel notes and a little butterscotch. Pretty intense and a little too much of sweetness for me. Maybe aging will improve its drinkability, but for now a third of a bottle is enough for my liver...
Not a bad beer! Just too straightforward sugary for me.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","lefossoyeur"

Sugary sweetness with malt up front, though I also detected some dark fruit in there, with a fruity and sweet aftertaste.  Alcohol is there but it doesnt take away from the overall experience.

The head was off-white and creamy but quickly receded and left little if any lacing behind.  The aroma was roasted malts and dark fruits.  Minimal yeast.  The flavor too was dominated by what tasted like roasted malts, maybe it was burnt sugars?  Again very little yeast profile.  Some old chocolate.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a medium to dark brown with slight orange highlights and a very small, off-white head that mostly diminished and left fair lacing. The aroma was moderate caramel malt and candy sugar; light to moderate doughy yeast; along with raisin, apple, red wine, brown sugar and alcohol. The initial flavor was sweet; while the finish was rather sweet, acidic and ever so slightly bitter. There was caramel, candy sugar, prune, raisin, yeast, more prune, brown sugar and spices.

2277,"2009-10-02",4.4,"11.5oz bottle. Pours a hazy, reddish-brown body with a thin, fizzy, tan head that dissipates quickly and leaves a veil of lacing on the surface and glass. The nose is greeted by dusty chocolates and medium sweet caramels along with cherries and a slightly tart orange. In the background there is a light smoke, ripe banana, a light Belgian yeasty dough, more flowery fruits and melons, and a bit of a creamy peppercorn. No real hint of hop bitterness or alcohol. Very nice malts and fruits with a light tartness as well as many more aromas make this extremely pleasant. The flavor is greeted by rich and sweet caramels and a light chocolate maltiness with plenty of fruit. Lots of caramels. Banana esters, dark fruits, a light orange tartness, and another whiff of smoke. Finishes with raisin bread, a hint of hop bitterness, and a warming alcohol pepper yeast. Very smooth, rich and sweet, and extremely slow drying thanks to that hint of hop bitterness. The big warmth from the alcohol yields no booze taste after a creamy carbonation and a medium to full body. Rich caramel and chocolate aftertaste that lasts for quite awhile along with plenty of fruit, brown sugar, and that delicious hint of bitterness. Overall, this is insanely good.

2277,"2009-09-04",4.4,"No date.  Excellent pour with a fully lasting, creamy, frothy, mostly full, beige layer of foam which leaves tight, Belgian lace throughout; the body is a hazy, rosy, mahogany color with sediment.  Nose is awesome, fruity, rich, and complex with a lot of spicing (spicy  cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg), some spicy alcohol wisps, rich chocolate brownies, lighter figs and dates, very doughy yeast, molasses, candied cherries and red currants, and a little bit sherryish.  Flavor is not much different, quite sweet and rich with some spicy and fruity complexity; lightly burnt caramel, fudge brownies, lots of spicy/doughy yeast, some brown sugar, sweet cherries and candied red currants, baked goods with nutmeg and ginger spicing, faintly roasted with some burnt toast notes, figs, and almost nutty towards the finish (almonds).  Palate is good but not exceptional with a mostly full, round chewy, velvety texture, soft to lively, but a bit dry on the end, taking away from some of the richness.  Finishes somewhat short for the style but pleasant with some roasted almonds, cherries, and a fruitcake-like note with all the spicing.  From the start, I was impressed with this one, and it did not disappoint.  My only complaint is the finish is a bit short and dry which depletes some of the richness the beer built up.  I believe it is right up there with some of the greats - Rochefort, St. Bernardus, etc.; maybe not quite as perfected but very close.  It is interesting to note that while the label says abt, the description says quad which I say has qualities of both; not quite opaque, very rich malt notes but a lot of fruit also, very round and chewy texture but also a bit dry in the end, etc.  Overall, I was very impressed with this one from Dieu du Ciel, they do very good work.

A little swirling brings out some chocolate, tobacco, and leather.  Theres some faint roastiness in the aroma along with banana and heavy spice.  As the beer first hits my tongue I initially get a very dry, earthy, nuttiness that is quickly overwhelmed by sweet dates, raisins, and alcohol as I swallow.

Lightly nutty cracker beside the rich malt sweetness, faint caramel and light chocolate with think orange peel and plum.  End-stage peppercorn.  A delicate flowery air, with subtle cheek warming and absolutely no rough edges.  Smoothness bespeaks controlled low-temp fermentation and obvious craftsmanship.  Full body is syrupy and sugary, yet theres no disgusting slurry or cloy-overload as in other 10%+ malt bombs (Im looking at you, DFH); even though  its not as dry as the Sixth Glass I had last night, this is very drinkable.

Very full-bodied, but more austere than the luxuriant creaminess of, say, Westy 12. Better executed and finessed than the US quad examples Ive sampled so far. Final impression of full, doughy bread - if this beer was something Monks would drink to maintain themselves during lent, it would serve its purpose as food substitute very well.

Despite a vigorous pour, just a thin, hazy layer of beige foam forms at the surface, frothy bubbles forming a ring around the edge.  A thick, sheeting wash slides down the glass slowly, leaving behind some wet spotting and droopy arch lace.  The nose is pretty spot on, with big, malty notes of caramelized brown sugar, fig, and fruity plum working nicely together.  Hints of bread pudding with raisins emerge as well, along with a touch of cola.  The flavor dives a bit deeper, though is sharper and more alcohol driven.  Toasted sugars, grilled plum, and overly ripe fig provide ample sweetness, with a dash of molasses providing hints of smokiness.  Some cocoa and anise shine through, with spicy, floral yeast going long on the finish.  The mouthfeel is substantial, yet a bit too hot and overly prickly.

The taste is extremely sweet with candi sugar and dark fruits dominating.  There is some chocolate noticeable in the taste that I could detect in the nose and the finish has an alcohol burn that takes a while to notice.  The spiciness of the yeast really comes out as well.

This is a fairly full-bodied beer, very smooth and complete coats the palate with sweetness which lingers for a long time.

Im highly impressed with this beer and think it is a great representation of the style, leaning heavily to the sweeter side of things.  Big fan.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

A touch too sweet, but still very good, and it went very well with some dark chocolate.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
2277,"2009-05-16",3.5,"12oz brown glass twist-top. No date, but just arrived in Vermont a week ago (not that thats a guarantee since we all know who imports it).

Appearance: Poured into a Duvel tulip. 1 finger of tan head fades quickly leaving nothing. Cloudy medium brown color.

Nose: Lots of fruitiness, from raisins to apricots, a little wool blanket. Promising.

Palate: Medium-bodied and sharp with some acidity around the edges, like a granny smith apple soaked in old whiskey. Big fruitiness is sideswiped by the alcohol and clamors, stumbles around my palate before being shoved out the back door by the bouncers (boozey) and falling down my throat.

Translation: This beer is bold and brash right now. I think it would do for some time to calm down all these aggressive fruits and booziness. But, to be honest, not sure if that will ever totally happen.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","SFLpunk"
2277,"2009-05-13",3.8,"11.5 oz recent 09 bottling served at 55F.  Pours a dark glowing brown with a small fine creamy off-white bubbly froth.  Aroma is strongly dark and fruity, distinctly Dieu du Ciel perfuminess, rich toffee, some toasty candi sugars, Belgian yeast that actually reminds me slightly of Unibroue.  First taste is all alcohol, dried dark fruits, and dark brown sugar, followed by more alcohol, toasty sugars, almonds, vanilla.  Becomes quite floral with a hard candy like sweetness, cloying.  Yeasty sweet butterscotch finish with a lasting burn.  The floral nutty bitter aftertaste is somewhat reminiscent of Westy.  Medium/full bodied, smooth glassy feeling, very fine smooth bubbly soft soda carbonation.  It really gives the mouth the impression of sucking on a hard candy.  Oops I didnt see the thing about needing to age for 6 months which is now quite apparent in the flavor.  Its okay because I have more =).","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

Strong Belgian yeast in the nose.  Toffee and caramel are the predominant malt aromas.  No notable hop.  Touch of Confectioner Sugar.

A sweet beer.  Noticeably potent and very full bodied, almost as if an unfermented wort was blended in.  Almost candy like in the taste.  The swallow features a spritzy bitterness that fades quickly to the mouth numbing alcohol content, which is overpowering in the aftertaste.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","smcolw"

2277,"2009-01-24",5.0,"UPDATED: NOV 27, 2009 God of Heaven, this is a terrific beer.  Quadrupels in Québec are harder to find then proofs that God exists.  This Dieu du Ciel beer might in fact be one of these proofs!  I never had a Westy but I prefer this one to Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus 12.  Who could describe all the flavours in there ?  The commercial description only mentions a few of them...  And the description doesnt say a word about its rich and thick texture...  9.5% ABV for the brew I had today on tap, on the second anniversary of being with my girlfriend.  I dont think that it is the special occasion that has me giving a perfect score; it is an amazing beer.  ADDED:  I bought 18 bottles today! Hehe!  Price ranging between 2,59$ to 3,55$ for 341 ml, 14,49$ for 6 at a mysterious location.  10,5%.  I could presently lower that perfect rating a little but I wont do it.  The beer will benefit from a few months more of aging and the texture will thicken, but it is already heavenly to me.  More spices than I remembered on tap.  God am I happy they bottled THIS ONE.  Thank you, really!  ADDED:  Agings making it smoother and smoother.  The perfect score will stay.  November 09, I still have 6...   And La Porte des Bieres, on Laurier street, in Montreal, still have many bottles... Sold at the bargain price of 4,99$ per 341 ml bottle.  Such a bargain and such a rip-off at the same time.

This one took a while to grow on me - I had several samples over 3+ days, and it got progressively better for me.  The key word for this beer is pungent - I swear it smelled (and ever tasted) sweaty, whatever that means.  Aroma was very sweet, persimmon, raisin, other fruit, a hint of chocolate and wood resin, moderate alcohol presence, extremely spicy and yeasty, a bit eccles cake-y.  The taste was very hard to pin down, I got roast, booze, spruce resin, green fruit, yeast ... sweet, yes, but pungent (there’s that word again).  Average body, strangely it was also a touch acidic, with a long sweet/spice pungent finish.  After several samples I concluded this was quite complex - the pungency covers a lot of subtlety, and this is all the more impressive as this style usually suffers when tapped (I prefer ABTs bottled).","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

2277,"2005-07-23",4.0,"Tried in January, again in July. Hazy red/brown with a short tan head. Aroma of chocolate, bready malts, fruit and booze. Flavours were nicely to style with the alcohol hiden behind a nice layer of raisins, grape, caramel, some nice toasted malt and cherries. I would like to have had more of the bottled version as it seemed a little quieter on tap.","Southampton, Ontario, CANADA","Crockett"
2277,"2005-07-22",3.9,"Bottom of the bottle...RBSG2005... Murky, mud-colored ale with a small, frothy, beige head. Good retention. Aroma is breadsy and malty with notes of caramel, dried plum, dark raisins, pear, bubble gum and red wine. Malty, fruity flavor. Medium sweet. Mild alcohol warmth. Full-bodied and very creamy with medium carbonation. Finishes with plum, caramel and alcohol. Terrific take on the style!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2277,"2005-07-20",4.0,"07.09.05  January 05 bomber, RBSG.  Dark burgundy, tall tan head is rocky and fading.  Aroma is woody, canned fruit salad juice, mildly vinous, bubblegum, maybe a touch metallic.  Flavor bursts with old fruits - pear, apple, cherry.  lOts of alcohol present, especially in finish and somewhat burning.  Not as complex or rich as hoped, but very nice.  Its missing that yeasty something that would convince me its Abt, and not just another quad.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

2277,"2005-07-13",3.6,"First touch is smooth, then the harshness of the wood explodes across the palate.  Like licking an oak barrel.  Aroma is a complex mixture of berries and nuts, with a lovely woody hop and yeast finish.  More of the same oak-like harshness detracts from what would be a solid beer.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

2277,"2005-03-13",4.2,"on tap at DdC, poured a deep brown color with a tan creamy head.  aroma was fruity, almost a red wine or a bourbon smell, tough to tell exactly in the pub.  malts and carmels control the taste, with hints of hops on the end, along with a little bit of hops and some wine tones.  all the flavors were perfectly balanced from beginning to end as part of a medium to full body.  other than the peche mortel, this was the best beer at the pub during my visit, and this is the one i went back for another round of after the sampler was gone.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","richlikebeer"

Dark brown color, with what seemed like some violet tinges around the edges.  Beige colored head is gone by the time I carry my glass from the bar to my table.   Aroma of lightly tart/sour yeast, dark concord grapes, hints of burgundy wine and just a tinge of dark chocolate and light caramel.  Seems VERY fruity and tart for an abt. . .Flavor is equally strange, with more fruit phenols and grapeskin notes.  Lightly dry/sour yeast does not seem to go well with the above-average carbonation and only medium body.  Sweetness begins to grow on the palate, with plenty of dark candi sugar and light chocolate notes.  A hint of alcohol, more yeast and fruit round out the finish.  Certainly an interesting ride along the palate, and my first thought was that maybe it was just too young and needed more aging, but the body isnt all that big to stand up to serious aging.  I definitely finished my glass, though I cant say I loved it.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Rich sweet caramel apple banana yeasty aromas. smooth with no evident alcohol once again - seems to be something this wonderful brewpub is good at - and various mouth-coating flavours of caramel ad apples and malts and maybe a little chocolate too. Lingered nicely but with perhaps a touch too much sweetness throughout - could have been a touch more balanced.

(4+) Aroma is rather spicy, which I did not expect - didnt remember it having that spice character in the past. Touch of malt. Earthy malt with just a brief touch of lemon, sweet malt core but spice is dominant for me. Smooth average plus to medium bodied palate. (3+) Solid. 7/4/7/4/15 - 3.6 Tap @ Volo Cask Days 2008
<P>RBSG 2005. Dark brown body, moderate off white head. Sweet alcoholic nose with plenty of malt reinforcements. Typical quad profile, (?) sweet sugary malt with a moderately alcoholic finish.

Malty in mouth, almost vinous, but not quite, roasted caramel, chocolate. I enjoyed the finish, but it was perhaps a little unbalanced on the sweet side. Strongly recommended.  Its about time that I update this rating. In the last three years, this has only gotten better. Absolutely luscious maltiness, soothing. It goes straight to your soul and is constantly a highlight of their anniversaries where some aged bottled are popped opened. Hopefully it is bottled someday.

Caramel malts support banana esters and baccate fruitiness in a perfectly conditioned body, ending in doughy yeast, peppery alcohol and spicy hop bitterness. Not as chocolatey as I remember older brewpub batches to have been, but still a mighty fine example of the style.
(Fresh) : In the bosom of the chocolate giantess lies chunks of nougat floating on a rich river of molasses, from which spurt delectable cherry alluvions...An affable and lovely peppery red wine embryo quietly slides out from its warm caramel womb...In a few years, we will revel in its grandeur...

2005 and 2006 batches: this is just getting better and better folks. Palate is to die for, flavors are all prominent and balanced, this is now near greatness for the style. Rounder than Rochefort 10,  Westy 12, St.Bernardus Abt, etc. yet as classy, complex, and soul-warming. If they ever bottle this, I wont need to stock up on the aforementioned deities nearly as often.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
