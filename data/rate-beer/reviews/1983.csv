Its recognizable as a Guinness, although it has been some time I had a Guinness last time and for some reason this one tastes like a different Guinness (less sweet one and missing the body that Ive come to expect from Guinness).

Roast barley aroma, chocolate, hints of coffee. Pitch black with smooth tan head. Taste of roast cereal, and pretty much like the aroma. Full bodied but not overwhelmingly so, drinkable. Thick.

Its also very roasty, sourish, bready, theres molasses, coffee and cocoa. Tastes really sweet initially - even sugary, but not too much, with a lot of roastiness and finishing bitterness. Kind of robust. No carbonation to talk about... or... thats funny, as Im almost halfway through, the carbonation has become very noticeable and even crisp - go figure. Theres a somewhat irritatingly fizzy finishing mouthfeel. The hop (extract!) bitterness in the finish, together with the roastiness, make for a curious and somewhat unusual mix. Rather thin texture.

1983,"2014-08-18",3.4,"UPDATED: APR 29, 2017 Strong Guinness made for the Belgian market under license of Anthony Martin; if export stout is to be seen as a separate substyle, different from e.g. foreign stout and others, then this must be the archetypical example, though it is admittedly hard to maintain the concept as a separate style in the modern craft beer era - it only made sense in the traditional context of 19th and 20th century Europe.  Black (though translucent mahogany on the edges) with a beige, dense head, dense aroma of roasted coffee beans, iron, dried fruits, molasses, pepper. Spicy drop taste with bitter chocolate and black coffee, uncompromizing roasted bitterness, thick and mouth-filling, assertive and even a bit salty, very dry with a long bitter finish, oily mouthfeel. Very enjoyable, but seems to have turned sweeter and more caramelly malty in recent years, I miss the black roastedness it had in the old days.  My rating here is therefore an average of both.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

1983,"2014-04-13",5.0,"Admirable stout dans cette version « special export » pour le marché belge, qui titre donc à 8%abv,
au lieu des 4,2 % du stout classique local irlandais ou de tous les irish pubs du monde .
Couleur noir profond, magnifique, dune opacité totale.
La mousse au versage est sensiblement différente dune mousse commune de Guinness bien crémeuse.
Ici elle est beige foncé à assez gros flocons au départ et couleur un peu passée, puis elle devient 
effectivement crémeuse comme sa petite sur, certes moins épaisse mais de texture bien crémeuse et dun beige clair bien connu.
Arômes de céréales, pain complet, chocolat noir, candi.
1ère bouche très souple sur un très bel ensemble café/céréales, avec une pointe de réglisse.
Arrière-bouche très torréfiée, mais très distinguée et longue.
2ème bouche à la texture superbe, chocolat fin de dégustation, pain aux 7 céréales, café doux.
Arrière-bouche complexe, longue.
La longueur enchaîne avec de grandes beautés, des saveurs vraiment riches, denses et pourtant
douces. Très bel amalgame et harmonie fantastique.
La levure est parfaitement incluse.
Lalcool est bien progressif, et on sent leffet bienheureux des 3,8 % abv en plus que la classique : effet sur les saveurs et la suavité.
La finale ne faiblit pas et témoigne de ce quest un grand stout.
CONCLUSION : quel bonheur de trouver LA vraie version de lIrlande dans LA version belge de sa
bière emblématique, 
comme quoi les Irlandais ont parfaitement compris que le belge était exigeant sur la vérité 
dune bière, son aspect équilibré et dense, avec une force de caractère intégrale.

1983,"2012-06-21",3.4,"Oh the sought after Belgian Guinness, for some reason I was under the impression that this wasnt even common in Belgium... alas it was in every bottle shop, night shop, and grocery store we went to. 

Pours a very dark, almost black color with some ruby hues when held up to the light.. The head is small but it leaves a nice lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is roasty and a bit buttery at first, but that butteriness fades off. The aroma has some interesting notes of over ripe fruit that becomes more focused and cherry like as the beer starts to open up.  

The flavor is roasty and nicely bitter. All around well rounded with a mild sweetness, the finish is dry and a little bit hot. Some pear and cherry are weird but not unwelcome alongside the bold espresso like coffee tones.

Poured into a glass tumbler, because that is what was available in the hotel room.

Its a Guinness, so its dark with a huge tanned head: the smell is of a regular Guinness with alcohol added. Even the head (which refuses to shrink) tastes like an alcoholic infused normal Guinness.

Dry and malty taste, the alcohol detected in the aroma is hidden better within the mouth flavours, but appears somewhat in the aftertaste as the mouth drys; and as already mentioned, in the foaming head.

Der Antrunk ist sehr röstmalzig und alkoholisch, der Abgang hallt sehr lange nach, und zwar kaffeeartig und ebenfalls alkoholisch.

Ganz im Gegensatz zu der Karamell-artigen Note, welche ab der Mitte auftaucht und sich bis zum Ende behaupten kann. Trinkt sich insgesamt doch sehr schwerfällig.

Pours with a thin tan head and a nearly-black body. There are some light spots of lacing around the sides and bubbles on top. The nose is light roast and a surprising amount of caramel and, especially, toffee character. Theres some light candy and brown sugar as well.

The taste brings a good dose of toffee along with some light roasted character and some super mild espresso following through after that. Medium body with moderate carbonation. The finish is fairly smooth and slightly dry. This is nice and easy to drink. The finish seems to dry out even more as I get through the bottle. Pretty good stuff. Thanks again, Matt.

Nice enough looking brew, and it is not as black as some of versions of Guinness that Ive sampled; very deep, dark mahogany that verges on black, just not black; really great retention on the head that started as a nice creamy and a little bubbly tan head with some sticky lacing down the side of the glass. 

Lightly sweet maltiness starts out first; then the roastiness comes in; a little hint of smoke and sweet tobacco; pretty nice aroma. 

Punch of roasted malts; bit of a booze burn on the tongue coupled with the roasted malts; not really alcoholic in the taste; just a very nice warming on the palate and the back of the throat; really dark chocolate hints come in at the finish; some burlap as well. 

Creamier, and very soft carbonation. A really warming 8% and I think that has to do with how roasty the malts come through in this.

A - Deep black with some ruby hues especially at the edge. Gigantic, thick, foamy, creamy, meringue-like, light beige head. Great retention with a good lacing left. Very nice looking beer.

S - A touch faint, but a good amount of licorice, some fruit, also some mocca/espresso. These go along with the general roasted malt and chocolate. Has a bit of a BSDA smell.

T - It starts off with a bit of a roasted malt taste. This quickly gives to a BSDA-like flavor. There is a good amount of licorice, dark fruits, and some Belgian yeast. Then more stout flavors come out. A bit more roasted malt, along with some chocolate, mocca, burnt sugar/caramel, molasses, licorice, a bit of earthiness, and some lactose sweetness. Somewhat bitter, somewhat sweet, and a little warming alcohol presence all mix throughout the sip.

M - Medium body with average carbonation. Smooth and rich taste. Not quite as full and thick/chewy as I would have liked, but not bad really, the rest of the beer just set the bar pretty high.

D - Easy to drink and makes me coming back for more. A large diversity of flavors that mix well, and are easy on the palate. Well balanced and is smooth. Only probably for drinking multiple ones in a sitting is the ABV, which is pretty well hidden.

Notes: A very nice beer, too bad Guinness doesnt make more beer like this, or at least have this beer distributed to a larger area. Taste like a mix of a BSDA and a stout. A lot of different flavors that intertwine and mesh nicely. Glad to have tried this (and on St. Patricks Day too).","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

Unfortunately, the aftertaste is a bit unpleasant, with the mix of alcohol and bitter malt leaving a syrupy-burnt flavour lingering for quite some time.

1983,"2008-01-12",3.7,"Deep brown coloured body (about 80% opaque) with a super large tan head and ruby highlights when held up to the light - this is the way a non-draught version of the beer should look like! Aroma of roasted malt, roasted rice, caramel, toffee, hazlenuts, peanuts and even a bit of milk chocolate. Full-bodied; Super strong roasted malt flavours with chocolate and coffee most noticeable. Some bittering caramel comes through at the very end - but mostly malty flavours dominate, coupled with some nuts. Aftertaste shows some really bitter metal and nuts with the obligatory yeast, malt and coffee tastes. Overall, a good special version of the beer - not amazing (like Singapore), but still not as bad (as say China).

Well rounded aroma of dark cocoa and milk chocolate with a light roasted quality and even lighter fruity notions of cherries and figs.

Flavor is quite full of action from front to back. Slender and dark fruity front, sweetly sided undertones at first, then, bold and creamy, big roasted chocolate cake center, dry and bittering finish with burnt crusty edges of roasted malts and grains. Turns to smoke, charcoal, tar, coffee grounds, and dry licorice spice as it cinders off into the finish. Wonderfully complex and layered with fun roasty flavors. A great whirlwind at the finish totally knocks it out of the park.

Feel is rich, thick, and velvety with a unique sweet under carriage that keeps a very nice balance. The roast never really completely takes over but makes great efforts to do so. The body of this stout continues to grow in texture as it warms, becoming creamier and warmer in cocoa returns towards the finish as does the coffee grade.

Jan, 2005 Bottle from Beer Essentials, Horsham. Sweet & fruity - dark berries. Soft chocolate. Smooth. Strawberries & cream. Lacks the typical bitter roasty edge. In fact doesnt taste like a Guinness, more like an everyday stout with lots of sugar. Its quite pleasing, but insubstantial. [3.3]
Oct, 2006 Bottle at Café Belge, Eastbourne. Wow! Not insubstantial today at all. A Guinness Foreign Extra Stout with Belgian yeast and candi sugar. Sweeter and softer than the regular FES, and with a spicy yeastiness. I love it - I love the blend of dark chocolate burnt bitterness and soft yeasty sweetness. Do I love this more than the Nigerian Guinness? Hmmm. Probably not. But it would be fun to try them side by side. [4.2]
April 2017 330ml dark bottle, filtered, from Tesco labelled as 1944 Antwerpen Stout. Its note-worthy that Guinness are now making this available through Tesco - it kind of shows the interest the general public have in more interesting beers, and stouts with a high abv. Im enjoying this - its truly a quality beer, but at the same time Im thinking of aspects of it that I feel are lacking. Its very smooth, rich, and easy drinking, with a big fluffy mouthfeel. Quite divine in that respect, but its also a tad sweet for my taste, and lacking in some of the qualities that I think make the standard Guinness (not the nitro version) quite special - it lacks the bitter edge, and it lacks that hint of red wine tartness that lifts Guinness into the sublime. Mind you this is very dreamy on its own.And there is some hints of red berries on the swallow. O go on with you, this is simply bloody lovely!

There is much more of an aroma than you are used to.  The beer pours a dark brown color.  There is no hint of ruby color to it if you hold it up to the light as in standard Guinness.

Thick and sweet in the mouth, with forceful, yet pleasing presence on the palate, slying slinks on the tongue, dripping flavor throughout...same complexity of flavor found in the aroma occurs again in the taste, a rich mix of cocoa and coffee, sweet caramelly tones, dark molasses, tar, licorice, pepper, and a fresh feeling, though I have no idea how long its been since this beer was bottled. Full bodied, long, strong, sweet finish, excellent balance...tons of dark malt, not much hops, but still, a wonderful interplay and a unique flavor combination.

1983,"2003-09-20",2.4,"Brownish head.  Dark, brown colour.  Malt, sweet aroma.  Water-flavour, little sweet.  The aftertaste reminds me of 'drop', a disgusting sort of candy.","Aarschot, BELGIUM","diabel"

Quite light nose. Interesting body structure, some sweetness well hidden by loads of caramel, followed by the roasted and hop.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

1983,"2003-07-16",4.0,"Great. Regular Guiness loses all its flavor if you don´t drink it on tap but this one is good in bottle. Its like a powered version of Guiness, with an even more complex taste. I could drawn in this wonder.","SPAIN","minguimore"
1983,"2003-05-24",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2003 This one actually turned out to be quite ok. Appearance is black with a creamy light-brown head. Smoked, malty and coffee aroma. Bitter flavour and palate.","Bussum, NETHERLANDS","jerohen"
1983,"2003-05-14",3.5,"The color is black with a fine light brown head. The flavor is licorice, slightly smoked, and sweet. The flavor is very sweet and slighty smoked. A good Guinness but too soft for my liking of a stout.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
1983,"2003-05-11",3.8,"Bottled at the Danish Beerfestival 2003: Very black coloured with a beautiful chocolatish head. This is a very nice looking beer. Aroma is roasty and hoppy with destinch coffee notes. Roasty and coffeish flavour as well that ends up in a huge bitterness. A bit sharp mouthfeel, but not in any way unpleasant. Good stout.","Søborg, DENMARK","madsberg"
1983,"2003-03-01",3.6,"Colour: nearly full black. Dark brown, very thick head, going down as lace. Nose gives burnt malts, black coffee, roasted nuts. Bitter, and in the same breath malt-sweet taste, again overtaken by roasted malt bitterness and caramelisation, constantly fluctuating. Retronasal flavour of coffee-covered cookies and cured ham. Rich mouthfeel, little carbonisation, seems to have been knocked out by pouring. The  little carbonation notwithstanding, there's a sourness from the CO2. This is a very strange beer, very balanced with sweet, bitter and sour collaborating to create a rich beer. I have problems with its qualification as ""sweet"" stout. Somewhere between a classis Irish stout and an Imperial ditto, I'd say.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

1983,"2002-08-11",4.0,"What hits you right away with this one is that while the appearance is very similar to the regular draught (although the head didnt seem to last quite as long) it is a very complex stout. Bigger more complex aroma than regular draught. Significant festive character, caramel, malty sweet, chocolate, fruity and doughy yeast, plum pudding and even faint cola,  aroma. Palate is wider and more dynamic, and flavours are more complex and stronger than regular draught version probably to hide higher ABV which it does well. Flavours mirror aroma nicely resulting in smoother finish and an aftertaste that is much less bitter and more alcoholic than the regular draught Overall better than the regular draught except for the major disadvantage of having to drink fewer to remain upright (could be an advantage for some). More research needed.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","OlJuntan64"
1983,"2002-08-08",4.1,"Aroma of chocolate cookie with a certain vinous note that stops just short of red grape juice.  Exceedingly dark red-brown/black with a nice and lasting head.  Flavor has more complexity than any dry stout Ive tried so far.  Theres pumpernickel, a hint of molasses, currant, a burnt, grainy aspect, some lightly roasted coffee and a slight, musty yeast flavor.  Finish sees some roasted sweetness, but aftertaste and mouthfeel are indeed dry.  Some alcohol present in finish and into the aftertaste as well.  I really wish I could get this all the time, Id love to explore the inky depths of a 6-pack of this.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
1983,"2002-08-07",3.2,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2016 Bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting. Body is black (non-opaque). Aroma is moderately malty (roasted/burnt grain, molasses, unsweetened chocolate), with light notes of tar and alcohol. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter, slightly husky. Medium to full body, creamy texture, soft/lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Well hidden alcohol and nice mouthfeel, but otherwise a pretty boring stout. The FES in the Caribbean is richer and more enjoyable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Original rating from 2002: Im not that familiar with guinness or other stouts, but i figure this one is pretty complexed. Heavy taste, bitterness, but sweet bitterness. Burnt malts indeed. You probably have to learn to drink this stuff... 2.2","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
