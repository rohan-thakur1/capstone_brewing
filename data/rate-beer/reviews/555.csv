555,"2017-06-07",4.3,"I am not a fan of the Ovila Dubbel, but the wine and bourbon barrels bring out the best in this. Cherry and fruit flavors are well blended with the caramel and oak. This should have been the original version.","LAS VEGAS, Nevada, USA","kathouse"
555,"2017-06-06",3.9,"750 ml. bottle at Lunar Brewing Co., poured to snifters showing a hazed, walnut color, with a modest layer of off white head foam that reduced to a persistent ring & film, and left some wavy ribbons on the glass. The nose was Belgian yeast spiciness, a candy-like sweetness of malt & caramel, plum, raisins, light barrel/oak, a bit of vinous character, and some waiting alcohol. Medium bodied, with low carbonation, the taste was similar, adding some earth & skins-like bitterness, creaminess to the mouthfeel, subtle, bourbony alcohol that came out of the shadows to meld nicely with the other notes, and a pleasant dryness to the finish. Excellent choice for a belated, celebratory toast of Tim As BD. Smooth, tasty, and thanks for the share!","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
555,"2016-04-29",4.0,"Oddly lex complex than the (just) wine BA version of old as the bourbon sweetens things up quite a bit and perhaps covers a few subtleties with a big sweet coconutty presence. Cant say I minded at all, though I still think the red wine version is best.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
555,"2016-04-14",4.3,"Pours a heavy cola brown. Aroma is out of the world. Rich, sweet, with lots of dark fruit. Flavor is incredible. Lots of depth and complexity. Sweet, but not top much. Rich caramel with hints of vanilla and cherry. Top-tier brew.","Charleston, West Virginia, USA","thechandler"
555,"2016-04-13",3.8,"Refrigerated 75 cl brown bottle poured into a snifter. Clear medium brown with very small beige head. Aroma is nice dark malt, medium body, low carbonation, and little lacing.

555,"2015-12-25",4.0,"Red wine aroma. Some spiciness, maybe from the yeast, and malt hiding in there. Pours a cloudy brown red with a lacing of off white head. Really rich sweet flavor, a nice light spiciness. Nuttiness, woody, some wine barrel, caramel. Delicious. Good thick bodied. Merry Christmas!","Austin, Alabama, USA","lownote"

555,"2015-12-17",3.4,"First beer after a 100-day hiatus. The aging makes this less sweet than the original. But it just isnt very interesting to me. Dubbels are probably my least favorite Belgian style. Good, but I wouldnt repurchase.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
555,"2015-12-06",4.1,"Dark pour, tan head. Cool beer. I love the Belgian base with the red wine barrel. Lightly tart, vinous, bourbon, vanilla. Good!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
555,"2015-11-29",3.8,"Bottle. Pours brown, with a light brown head. Aroma is malt, wine, brown sugar, and yeast. Flavor is wine, malt, and wood. flavors are subtle, and the body is too light.","Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA","zathrus13"
555,"2015-10-25",3.9,"Deep mahogany with a thin lasting light tan head. Big dark nose with dark Belgian malt, oak, whiskey and port wine, and a dash of vanilla. Surprisingly smooth and quaffable flavor with oak, brown Belgian malt, light whiskey/bourbon notes, chewy nutty oaked grains and a little fruity port. Super balanced and super drinkable, which leaves each individual flavor profile slightly blandish. Its a great beer but doesnt excell in any one direction, unfortunately.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

555,"2015-10-11",4.1,"750ml bottle, shared with Amy S and Chris R and alexsdad06. This bottle got recent distribution, and indicates on the back of the screen-printed bottle that its aged in a blend of red wine & bourbon barrels. That detail may be easy to miss. Hazy darker red color. Thin off-white ring of head, some bits of lace. Medium to bigger body. Nice fullness, good chewiness. Mild slick. Great, complex, well-rounded aroma... Dark fruit, mild spice, some tannin and vanilla all play nicely together. Moderate-plus sweet taste though nowhere near cloying. Mild bitter, mild warmth. Awesome stuff.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

555,"2015-08-30",3.6,"Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate caramel, vanilla, light bourbon, and a hint of fruit. It pours a transparent orangish-brown with a small beige head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a slightly thicker ring. The flavor starts with caramel, raisin, and a touch of fruit. The finish has light vanilla and a hint of oak. Its medium bodied with mild carbonation and a somewhat soft mouthfeel.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

555,"2015-08-19",3.9,"Draft at tnadoN. Dark ruby brown with creamy khaki head. Good lacing. First thing about aroma that hits me is mandarin. Lovely citrus. Sits atop caramel, toffee, light vanilla. Dont get the wine, but I suppose theres a vague tannic component toward the end so I can buy it. Moderately sweet, but finishes dry enough. Medium+ body, creamy texture. Overall: yum.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
555,"2015-08-15",3.7,"Bottle. Red brown pour. Nose of apple, pear, toasted malt, light bourbony oak and vinous fruit. Flavor is more apple and pear esters with some plum, faint oak, bourbon, coconut and tangy red wine. Light syrupy mouthfeel. Barrel flavors subtle, but enough.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
