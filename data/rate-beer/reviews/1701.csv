1701,"2016-05-25",4.1,"Draft at Bottleworks SD (Little Italy). Banana and clove, clove and banana. Tastes exactly like a Hefeweizen should, not too fruity or sweet but crisp and flavourful.

1701,"2016-03-01",4.3,"(on tap at Stone World Bistro Liberty Station) Pours a hazy orange color with a medium white head. Aroma right off the bat speaks to the quality of the beverage with a scent of dried banana chips, vanilla, wheat, light lemon, bubblegum, and snappy clove. This is Dancing Man-esque. The flavor also holds dried banana chip, vanilla, snappy clove, and light bubblegum that finishes on a crisp, tart wheat note. Mouthfeel is full and creamy and the carb is effervescent. I havent often encountered a hefe of this caliber, but when I do, I am prone to rate it quite highly. This beer was completely dialed in to my expectations for the style, and not only were those expectations met, but they were exceeded.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

1701,"2010-12-18",3.6,"A: The pour is an intensely hazy and turbid golden yellow with a big white head that settles down to a fingers worth.

S: Theres a pretty nice banana and clove aroma which is an appreciated departure from the usual American ""hefeweizen"" that is actually just a crappy pale wheat beer. A nice sweet wheat aroma, and even a bit of wheat flour.

T: Taste is pretty much the same as the nose would let on. Perhaps a bit on the sweet side and lacking a bit on the esters, but still good. A touch of bubblegum, banana, and a solid amount of clove. Lots of sweet, wheat bread, too.

M: The body is medium with a smooth, medium carbonation.

More spicy clove than banana in the aroma, with some clean wheat behind.  Flavor adds a light lemony tartness trying to dominate the banana and spicy clove.

Some more yeasty banana notes are in the flavor, but are tamed down relative to the nose.  Some milky wheat flavors are in there as well, but arent perceived as grainy and thrive in pleasant harmony with the yeast spices.

1701,"2006-01-23",4.0,"This beer was served with a lemon, no questions asked (I hate when they do that).  The beer is a hazy orange color and it topped by a pale, thin, wispy, white colored head.  There is lots of banana in the nose up front, but then it is all clove towards the end.  Another draught of the aroma and it is all banana again.  This Hefeweizen really has an amazing aroma, it is so appealing and fresh, just about perfect.

The taste is light and refreshing up front.  After my first taste, I get a hint of something that seems a bit like toothpaste, but clove and banana are, typically, quite evident.  There is a nice, light, wheat-derived acidity here that helps to keep this beer quite refreshing.  The acidity, in addition to the carbonation tends to add a bit of a bite to this beer, which helps to balance the fruity phenolic notes.  The outstanding thing about this beer is its aroma, the taste does not quite live up to it, but this is still a very well done beer.

Only mildly sweet, so this definitely doesn’t taste like a wheat beer trying to mask a mediocre flavor.  Aromas of wheat, banana, bubblegum, mild sweetness.
