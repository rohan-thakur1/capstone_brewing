4474,"2014-12-20",3.5,"On tap at Glacier brew house. 
This was poured into a wine glass. 
The appearance was a dark brown color with tinges of hazy reddish purple along the sides of the glass. 
The smell had a big boozy burst of brown sugar and sweet dark fruits. 
The taste copied the smell and confided in a sweet sticky caramel aftertaste and finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a pretty good sipping quality about it. Light vanilla rolled over my tongue nicely. 
Overall, I say this was a pretty good eisbock. The ABV is up there but doesnt hit you too hard.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
