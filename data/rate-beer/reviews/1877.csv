1877,"2014-06-06",3.6,"Pours a bit more orange than golden, its got a smallish head that leaves some lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is spicy with some honey and herbal hops. Its a clean and inviting aroma. 

The flavor is lightly sweet & features a bunch of spicy happiness, some grassy and honey notes are there as well. Overall its really not a terribly sweet beer and the bitterness balances what sweetness is there very well. 

A nice atypical take on the style.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
