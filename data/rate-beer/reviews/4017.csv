4017,"2017-05-31",4.1,"Draft at Blackback. Feels like Im on jeopardy ordering this. Hazy golden pour with frothy white head, great retention and lacing. Aroma brings ... fruit juice (of the citrus variety - I want to say orange but I always want to say orange even though its probably some tropical fruit punch cocktail chock full of pineapple and stuff), grass - lean malt backing, hard to pick much out over the pungent hop punch. No caramel or anything, more in the biscuit / cracker direction, but its hiding so deep behind the hop component its hard to say much. Im stretching. Taste: light sweetness, moderate bitterness, lingering toasted Cheerios. Light+ body, average carbonation, soft texture. Overall: as best as a person can be objective, Id say this is an impressively well-crafted American pale ale. And here I am primed to love this -- getting out of the car once wed finally arrived into town a couple of hours ago I was positively giddy, stepping foot outside the gates of what may well be a neckbearded drunkards Mecca. Im looking forward to tomorrows pilgrimage to the holy site itself, but with some trepidation, because if Im being completely honest with myself, when faced with the question what is enlightenment? my hearts response is is that all there is? Perhaps its time to go dancing.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a hazy burnt yellow/orange color with an ever so slight transparency about it. Some carbonation could be seen to fill a one finger white foamy head. Speckled lacing ran here and there around the glass.
The smell started started off with some full bittersweet citrus, sweet grass, ""iced"" pulp and rind, malts underneath.
The taste was basically the same with a subtle sweet citrus malt aftertaste and finish. The finish is semi-dry but nice.

The beer is mildly hazy and appears a golden yellow color. The white head is about a half inch thick and leaves ample lacing on the tulip.

The nose is excellent. Dank hops and a variety of tropical fruits and citrus. Oh yeah...

The flavor is earthy with notes of well water (in a most positive way). Lots of citrus and hop notes. Simply fantastic. Chuggable. Another winner from Hill Farmstead. I think this is the best pale ale I have ever had. I am dumbfounded. I could drink this indefinitely.

A: Pours a hazy gold color with light peach hues. A thick and foamy white head forms on the pours and recedes to a nice ring and film that leave some splotchy lace behind.

S: The nose just explodes with intense hops. Robust pineapple, sweet golden delicious apples and mango are the wonderful fruits up front. There is some nice grassy hops in the middle and the finish is of sweet bread malts.

T: The malts show themselves a bit more in the taste, but it is still wonderfully balanced. Great citrus and tropical fruit flesh with tastes of pineapple and mango with a mix of grassy hops and sweet bread malts.

M: Light bodied with perfect carbonation. Nice and refreshing with a sweet malt and fruit combination that lingers long after the finish.

O: As with the rest of the group I was blown away to find it was only Amarillo and Simcoe hops in this brew. Superbly crafted and wonderfully balanced.

4017,"2012-09-11",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 2, 2013 In short: A superb refreshing and highly aromatic hoppy blond IPA bursting with floral and tropical fruits hops
How: A few times on tap.  This rating for a growler consumed fresh the day of purchase
The look: Cloudy yellow-blond body topped by a medium white head leaving lots of lacings on the glass
In long: As usual from HF hoppy beer, heres a highly aromatic hoppy nose, fresh an vibrant.  This one proposes a strong floral character backed by tropical fruits.  Body is typical blond IPA malt bill, a mix of fresh baguette, crisp crackers, low sweetess, soft bubbles.  Hopping provides a clean and flavorful bitterness that is more refreshing than intense.  I had this beer on tap on many occasions at the brewery and it is surprising how a few weeks can change a beer.  Once I noted that it was the least bitter of all the very hoppy beer Ive had, a few weeks later I found the bitterness was rather sharp.  But it was always excellent, and maybe my favorite of the all the Hill Farmstead single IPAs.  And if you are drinking this beer and a major in philosophy asks you what you are drinking, lie, make up a beer name, dont answer, just dont say the beer name, trust me on this one.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

4017,"2012-06-08",3.9,"@ Boilermaker.  Golden straw body.  Large off-white head.  Spotting lacing.  Nose is jammed with grapefruit, lemon, floral notes, and grass.  Assertive for a pale ale at this ABV.  Taste is quite similar to the nose.  Medium bodied.  Appropriate carbonation,  Mild bitterness, crisp finish.  Moderately dry.  A top tier pale ale.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
4017,"2012-06-08",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 30, 2012 Tap at HF and growler at home.  This is what many breweries should be doing for anniversary beers instead of these crazy messes with 13 hops and malts, and 7 yeasts.  I like Shaun as a brewer because he sticks with something he does well and works very hard to make those beers great. He could have easily jumped in on the ""sour and wild beer craze"" and i happen to know that he probably would make some great ones, but instead hes still working on creating awesome drinkable pale ale and world class (which cant be said for many American brewers) saisons.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

Big, fruity aroma- melon, citrus, mango and other tropical fruits, sweet malts, and some herbal and grassy notes. The flavor doesnt have the same fruity pop, but has more grassy and herbal notes, lemon citrus, melon, and sweet malts. Initially dank but then dry on the palate.

At the fest, this was probably my favorite beer of the day.  Super refreshing.  I can drink the hell out of this beer.  I want this all the time.

4017,"2012-06-01",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 2, 2012  Had this guy for the first time at the Hill Farmstead 2nd Anniversary party and didnt love it then. Wanting to give it a second shot (when I wasnt drinking it after so many other tasty treats at the event) I brought a growler home and....still dont love it. Dont get me wrong, its a really nice beer but I dont think it stands at the top of most of the other Hill Farmstead Beers Ive had recently. 

Pours a nice straw, slightly reddish color with a decent head that dissipates quickly. Smells delicious---pine, maybe a little papaya in there. Tastes pretty good, hop, grapefruit/orange peel...but a little too heavy on the peel. Bitterness lingers a bit for my liking. 

A nice beer, I just want a softer finish I think...","Massachusetts, USA","hammerslammer"

Rich rich West Coast mega dry hop with huge mango, tangerine, grapefruit, butterscotch. Like the best bottles of Sculpin, Alesmith IPA, and Alpine Duet. Taste begins with rich butterscotch, small caramel, juicy and tangy, with heavy whipped cream and vanilla ice cream. Sorbet, super silky palate. Feels like a shot of peach whipped cream. Very little alcohol warming. Very light, fluffy, refreshing. Has all the complexities and fruitiness of the best IPAs in the world but no sticky body and no alcohol presence.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
4017,"2012-05-28",4.0,"Verre, dun fût lors du 2e anniversaire de Hill Farmstead. Arômes intenses de houblon américain (agrumes, pêches, ananas). Robe blonde et très trouble, belle petite mousse et effervescence souple. En bouche, le houblon se montre vraiment très aromatique et fruité, très porté sur les agrumes. Le corps est très velouté malgré la grande sécheresse de la bière. Finale moyennement amère pour le style.

4017,"2012-05-26",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 2, 2012 On tap at the Hill Farmstead 2nd Anniversary party. Hazy golden yellow pour with a mountainous white frothy head. Giant citrus and juicy fruit notes give way to nectar fruit, scallion, and evergreen. Massively drinkable with a light body, medium carbonation, and dry crisp finish.  

After drinking an entire 2L growler of this with surprising ease, and another with friends, I think I must up my rating. The sessionability of this combined with the massive flavor and aroma profile makes this an incredible brew.  

Ok one more re-rate. I had this at the brewery side by side with Society 4, Abner, Walden, and Edward and it really stood out as one of my favorites. The hop flavor rivaled that of the big boys, but it had the drinkability of Walden. Maybe its that Im in a session beer mood lately, but this is truly one of the best pale ales Ive ever had.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"

4017,"2012-05-20",4.6,"Picked this up yesterday at 3PM at Hill Farmstead Brewery. Placed it in the fridge and poured into a Hill Farmstead Glass at 40 Degrees F. At the pop of the growler top, an eruption of pressure shot out some beer. Made me smile a bit.

A -Gorgeous beer! So beautiful. SRM of 9. Bright Yellow with a hint of brown. Very haze full beer. Head of 2-fingers with crystal clear bubbles and a solid head lacing. This beer is so pretty. 

S - Big bright hop scent before even pouring it. Big Simcoe hop aroma. Im getting Citra as well. Bright grassy citrus scent. Im getting wheat as well.

T - Very nice. Deliciously well balanced hops, very light malts and seems perfect to enjoy on this day of gardening and spring cleaning. Dry hopped Amarillo hops? Orange peels? Its a very simple beer yet very complex. Hard to point out any one ingredient. One word. Delicious.

M - 80% carbonation on the mouth swish. Light body. Very crisp grassy finish.

O - Wow. Thanks Shaun. You make the best beers in the world.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

The floral hops make their presence known in the aroma with lemon and citrus. Medium bodied and smooth. Fresh clean flavors of light tropical notes with a natural earthy quality. Nice bitter dry finish and well balanced and tasty. The hop profile is awesome and a nice nod to the Alpine beer which was its inspiration.","encinitas, California, USA","nightrider"

Nose is perfect, the Amarillo and simcoe are bright and fresh. A lot pine and earthiness as well. Nice dry pine, not overpoweringly bitter, quite nice. Moderate bitterness, medium mouthfeel, somewhat spritzy.  Really nice APA, probably one of the best hop forward beers ive had from HF. Sean is killing it right.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"
4017,"2012-05-12",4.1,"32oz growler courtesy of Sean... Pours a mostly hazy lemony orange hue, mostly opaque, and topped with a thin to medium soapy white head that eventually recedes towards the edges... Aroma is token Shaun which is assertive pungent dank tropical fruit and citrus accents. Burst of hops are relentless... Flavors continue on a similar wavelength with juicy fruity tropical fruit and dank overtones. Hops abound and just seem so incredibly fresh with a crisp semi-dry finish. Refreshing at this point but welcoming in any situation. Easy goin and mild body, not too light or heavy.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

Pours a slightly cloudy pale apricot with a really nice white head and quite a bit of lacing.  The nose has some light pineapple along with great citrus character and a bit of rind.  Extraordinarily flavorful.  Hoppy and great bitterness through the finish.  Mouthfeel is unmatched.  Classic Hill Farmstead.  Love it.
