The wine note also has a hint of vinegar at times. Medium-plus body is meaty and smooth with low carbonation. The combination provides a dangerously drinkable mouthfeel and balance.

4491,"2013-03-18",3.7,"Bouteille de 33 cl, merci beaucoup à Dany. Arômes très complexes de pain aux bananes, de chocolat, de fruits mûrs et de chêne. Robe bourgogne et légèrement trouble, pas de mousse et aucune effervescence. Complexe et originale en bouche, la bière montre une belle complexité maltée (blé, chocolat) ainsi que des notes fruitées et vineuses. On reconnaît certaines notes doxydation, plutôt agréables dans ce cas. Longue finale moyennement sucrée. Lalcool demeure très bien dissimulé. Très original !","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MJGG"

4491,"2012-11-09",3.8,"Bottle, 33cl. Its a clear one, with a nice, amber to brown color and no head. Its completely flat. The aroma has a distinct boozy touch, as well as lots of dried fruits, red wine, some wood, a vanilla touch, dark berries and a little hint of banana. Its full-bodied and quite warming, with a faint touch of rubber in the flavor. Red wine, some booze, banana and vanilla hints, dried fruits and caramel too. Red wine, booze and berries in the end. Certainly not an easy drinkable one, but very tasteful, except for that rubbery touch. 121109","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

4491,"2012-10-20",3.8,"Poured at the B. United table of Beervana - Cranston, RI. An almost completely flat pour, with no head. Aroma sings, though, of aged malt and a bit of booze. This is the most sherry-like beer Ive had, without struggling through some rough oxidation. The age, acid, and vinousness from the barrel really lends a lot to the base bock to transform it into one of those settled, thoughtful, and contemplative sweet, warm sippers.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
4491,"2012-10-16",4.1,"Dark brown colour, almost no head at all.  Aroma is vinous and wonderfully complex, with wood, vanilla, different dried fruits and red berries. Taste is slightly bitter with medium sourness, a good fit. Low carbonation, long finish/aftertaste with more complex aromas to explore. I chose to enjoy drinking it instead of writing down everything, so in short: it was delicious!

Less and less malty. Modest fruity. Beer dominated by alcoholic notes. Goes down burning. I exspected a bit more.","GERMANY","kappldav123"
4491,"2012-07-22",4.4,"No head, bit lifeless hazed brown beer. Excellent vinous nose, deep complex (red) wine aromas. This smells like a Premier or Grand Cru Bourgogne - Pinot Noir indeed! Again winey touches (also as from Oloroso Sherry) ruling, but also notes of chocolate and dark, ripened berries. Not really sweet, but a flavour hinting at raspberry jam. Finish is a bit less lively, thanks to the barrel agian, but it gives a long lasting, vinous, balanced aftertaste. Hint at (overripe) banana retronasal, and fuselalcohols. Rich, voluptuous, slick and velvety. Surprisingly little alcoholburn. Hans-Peter (et Jerôme), respect! This is really  ein Meisterstück !","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
