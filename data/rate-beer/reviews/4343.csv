4343,"2017-04-27",4.0,"22 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/7/2016. Pours crystal clear medium ruby red/copper color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread, vanilla, spicy rye, whiskey, toasted oak, biscuit, and nuttiness; with lighter notes of coconut, roast, raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready/rye malt, rye whiskey barrel, and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread, vanilla, spicy rye, whiskey, toasted oak, biscuit, and nuttiness; with lighter notes of coconut, roast, raisin, plum, fig, pear, apple, herbal, grass, light pepper, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal/peppery hop and rye/whiskey/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, brown bread, vanilla, spicy rye, whiskey, toasted oak, biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, grass, pepper, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/rye malt, rye whiskey barrel, and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and zero astringent hop/rye/barrel flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitter/spiciness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready, and fairly sticky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is fairly well hidden; a pleasant warmth with minimal barrel booziness lingering after the finish. Overall this is a great barrel aged imperial ESB style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/rye malt, rye whiskey barrel, and light-moderate fruity yeast/earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to sip on for the big ABV. Feels more hoppy, tannic, and barrel influenced than last years similar style; but was just as impressive. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
4343,"2017-03-29",4.0,"Bottle. Big, deeply brown and wholly frothy ... This has a rich, malty aroma, and drinks like the biggest, meatiest, most muscular brown ale ever. I typically dont love English brown ales, and although this is labeled an ESB, Id put it more in the brown category ... the rye aspect must make it grittier. But this is a delicious and fully flavored brew, and a nice alternative to the onslaught of uber-hoppy, citrusy beers attacking our society. This is a giant brew and huge alcohol kicker, but it resonates with a classical style that makes it all better. (#6557, 3/29/2017)","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
4343,"2017-03-27",3.6,"Bomber from nimbleprop. Dark amber and semi opaque. This is huge malts and I am not sure how it is an ESB. Super sweet malts dominate this. Occasionally some dark fruit pops in and some alcohol. Just a little rye whiskey. This is kind of a BBW of beers. Big and sweet.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
4343,"2017-03-03",3.7,"Thin light orange head of fine bubbles. Dissipates rather quickly. Sweet caramel in the aroma with some butterscotch, vanilla, bourbon and lots of malts. Aroma reminiscent of a barley wine and not an ESB. Color is a ruddy orangish brown. Moderate malt body and backbone which leaves it a bit on the sweet side. Buttery toffee, dark fruit, light herbal hops and some dry roasted grains which impart a bit of chalkiness to the palate. Moderate alcohol presence. Finishes sweet yet on the dry side. A pretty good brew.$","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"
4343,"2017-02-24",3.3,"22oz bottle pours a clear, garnet amber with a ring of white head. Nose has dried apple slices, booze, some candlewax, a little brandy/cognac, caramel, malt. Flavor follows, sweet malt and caramel, booze, bourbon, brandy, cognac, apples and pears, some bubblegum, some marzipan. Full bodied, boozy finish. A little messy. Might do well with a few months on it.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
4343,"2017-02-06",3.7,"Tap. Poured clear dark brown color with medium off-white frothy head that mostly lasted with good lacing. Medium to heavy toasted dark malt aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy toasted malt sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate to long duration. This is a solid brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
4343,"2017-02-03",3.7,"Rich super hazy brown, copper, bronze and muddy ruby tinted body with a small single cetimetre tall tan head. Aroma of super pungent toasted malt and metal with fruits, earth, grain, yeast and smelling of a lot of alcohol. Full-bodied; Rich toasted malt flavours with a pungent grain and toffee flavour, coupled with a lot of medicinal and metallic flavours and ending with a nice warming alcohol sensation. Aftertaste is quite complex with flavours ranging from cereal to pit fruits, toffee, earth, apricots, caramel, oak and vanilla all with the big malt and sweet flavours, without too much bitterness. Overall, a nice beer that shows a stiff pungency at first, but after a few seconds, those will dissipate and leave a nice and rich palate in place for minutes to come. I sampled this ten ounce draught at Whole Foods in Pentagon City (Arlington), Virginia on 03-February-2017 for US$4,00 at the end of my driveway!","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
