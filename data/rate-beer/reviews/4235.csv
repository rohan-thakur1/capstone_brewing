Mildly hazy yellow body with a quarter inch of soapy, bone white head. Nice mosaic presence. Fruity, mild sweetness. Mango character is there. Light bodied and elegant palate. Tasty!","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
4235,"2015-08-28",3.4,"Yeah yeah yeah, the vaunted Tired Hands. 32oz growler from the brewery, 4 days old. No pop when the swing top opens. Hazy, neon yellow body with a ring of white head. Hardly carbonated. Mosaic beers hit odd nerve endings for me, I always smell sour cream in addition to chive. Its not unappealing, its just funny. Plenty of grass on the nose too, mango, guava, light soap, a little candy. Flavor is good, very fruity, mango, guava, starfuit, tangerine, light hand soap, perfume, grass, chive. Finishes oily and without much pop, thanks to the non-existent carb. A lot like many of their other beers.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"

Aroma is powerful dank mosaic goodness, passionfruit, pot, really amazing. Flavor is a wonderful mix of dank dank mosaic hops and mango, hugely tropical. Light sweet, and light plus bitter.
