Pours a red-amber colour with a small foamy head.

Nutty aroma from this beer and roasted malts also coming at me. 

fruity flavours (dried) and a slightly floral hop flavour also (the latter very much in the background and not punching you in the face!).

Smooth drinking with a bitter roasted after taste.","Hazlemere, the lower Xhitlerns, Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Theydon_Bois"
1773,"2012-02-24",3.4,"Its beautiful red copper with a creamy head. The aroma has notes of burnt caramel, malt, nuts and fruit. The flavor is moderately sweet with notes like the aroma plus straw, and the finish is dry. Its really nice.","Thisted, DENMARK","Maria"

Nice malty taste with asmall malt sweetness. Small to medium bitterness and without hop taste. Slim body that gives this big drinkabillity.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","TEJA"
1773,"2010-08-09",4.1,"Bottle, thank a lot pivnizub. Hazy orange, golden foam. Beautiful fruity fat malt aroma with plenty of hop aromatics. Roasted and spicy entry, the typical vienna fruityness takes over, grassy, herbal and flowery hops round it off. 
Chewy fat mouthfeel, good carbonation breaks the residual sweetness. 
Really nice.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","jonas"

1773,"2010-06-24",2.9,"Bottle: Beautifully reddish-aber coloured, stable lacy and creamy off-white head; dryish roasty nose with some subtle nutty aromas underneath, a bit mineralic, too; light to moderate dry bitter-sweet flavour, light bodied and fizzy; short, almost empty, bitter-roasty finish with a certain fruitiness. looks great, smells good, but tastes only like an average brew. Unharmonic and disappointing......","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"
1773,"2010-06-06",3.1,"(bottle) Clear, amber colour with a reddish shine and a big and off-white foamy head. Sweet caramel-malty and slightly toasty aroma with subtle fruity notes and a slightly herbal hoppy touch. Moderately sweet flavour, rather light bodied with a soft carbonation. Pretty slim and slightly toasted malty base with notes of toffee and again very subtle fruity notes of dark and red berries; slim and sweet-bitter, slightly toasted and delicately hoppy finish. Too bad the brewery was already founded in 1160 (=11.60% master spice), I wished it would have been found later. 05.VI.10","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"
