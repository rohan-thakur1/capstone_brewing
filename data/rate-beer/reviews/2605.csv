2605,"2015-05-16",3.2,"64oz. growler fill served in a weizen glass- poured a transparent thin yellow color, massive two finger plus head formed and just refused to go away and laced nicely upon the vessel as I marveled at having all my glassware in plain sight and ready for immediate use (plus the old lady yelling I should keep unpacking tonight- but after 8 hrs. at work, hauling a load over, unpacking it, and making something to eat- itÂ’s beer time!). Aroma of clove, light wheat, and a hint of dust. Hits the mouth with a light body, malt is relatively clean and mild, some mild bubblegum in the middle, finish is complete with some cloves. Nice.beer to break into the new place!","Austin, Texas, USA","mmmbeer"

2605,"2013-06-28",3.9,"I would rate this higher, and perhaps I should - but the sad fgact is that I have become burned out on wheat beers after decades of drinking them, Excellent job on this one though. If only I had it a few years back I might have gone into a major rave.","austin, Tejas, Texas, USA","fly"
2605,"2013-05-27",3.7,"On tap at the Whip In. Crystal clear golden color with a white head. The aroma and flavor are great. I get a good dose of wheat, as well as some banana and clove notes. The flavor also has a good amount of bubblegum, a character I really dig in German wheat beers. Medium, soft mouthfeel and medium carbonation. A very nice beer. Hope they can it.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
2605,"2013-05-09",3.2,"Bright, clear golden color. White head. Old paper, light wheat malt aroma. Refreshing light fruity bubblegum flavor, better when its cold. Foamy body. Pretty awesome overall, but drink when cold.","austin, Texas, USA","kidmartinek"
