Nose is of nail polish (acetone, bummer) with a moderate lambic character and some earthiness. Not as vibrant as the young one thats for sure. Taste is moderately sour with a slight acetic tinge that is unfortunate but not a deal-breaker. Some sherry impressions (not that Im a xerez expert...) too. Good oak. Some awkward acetone in the finish. Body is light, carbonation moderate and mouthfeel is certainly vinous. Not bad but I vastly preferred the ""young"" version.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
