732,"2013-05-24",4.4,"Growler. Another great beer exclaiming how much it sucks. I think I may have a ""thing"" for rye IPAs, but this is incredibly drinkable and balanced. Didn't pick up any off flavors from the growler like the other beer I picked up either.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","Sperine"

A - Pours clear pale yellow with a nice one finger tall white head leaving sticky webs of lace down most of the glass.

S - Smells of grassy hops, dash of tropical fruit, pine needles, dulled spicy rye and a tiny bit of booze once it warms up. The rye plays second fiddle to the hops, which is fine by me.

T - Starts off with plenty of hop bitterness, both tropical and grassy, slowly giving way to hints of the backing spicy rye and a touch of booze. Finish is kinda bready with some hop bitterness mixed in, lingering on the palate long after the finish. A bit muted when fresh from the taps, gets better as it warms up in the glass.

M - Smooth, bready feel with plenty of hop bitterness. This is where the rye really comes through, providing a solid backing for all the hops to play off of.

O - It fits the description quite well. The hops are strong like a typical IPA yet not overpowering thanks to the rye core. A very nice hybrid beer with plenty of flavor that is easy to drink, give it a shot if you get a chance.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
