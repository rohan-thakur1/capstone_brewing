289,"2017-06-02",4.3,"500ml bottle bought at brewery a few months ago. Aroma: caramel nicely integrated with this bourbon goodness (including lots of vanilla). Some dark red fruits are also part of this party. App: clear brown with off white head leaving little lacing which is ok for the style. Taste and palate: medium to full body, smooth bourbon, lots of vanilla in mouth, sublet bitter and alcohol burning finish. Overall: let me preface this by saying Im not the biggest fan of bw as I often find bw too strong and big. This one is well made. So easy to drink despite its sweetness. It tastes so good! Lots of stuff in there : caramel, nuts, vanilla, a bit of coffee minus the bitterness, etc. I can say this is an amazing barley wine despite Im not a fan of the style. Guess, I shouldnt have traded my other bottles. Again, great job HF.","St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Stoned99"

289,"2017-03-13",4.2,"500mL bottled 9/8/16, acquired from the brewery, drunk 2/3/17.Light tan head showing moderate to moderately-strong retention tops a clear, caramel-tinted mahogany body with some deep magenta hues and a good clarity.Caramel, chocolate and vanilla all boast a complex, rich maltiness with delightfully well-expressed bourbon right beside it. Its a good mix of rich oak and spicy bourbon character that is almost perfectly balanced by the malt. Only a touch of heat, with no sharp booze or any heavy tannin/coconut/pineapple. Its very clean and polished and you cant deny the malt richness here. Fruitiness is minimal, with mostly some moderate raisin and fig character, but the dark fruit-like vinousness here is very minimal.Malty, as expected, in the mouth with a soft, chewy, comforting, malty texture that allows caramel, light milk chocolate, vanilla, nougat and raisin plenty of room to roam on the palate. Bourbon is classy and restrained, but excellently expressed nonetheless, showing spice and wood and no harsh ester/alcohol sharpness. Definitely rich and sumptuous and obviously tending towards the sweet side, but I can respect that and the beer is so well-executed and polished that, as usual with Hill Farmstead, I find myself giving a high rating to a style I generally hate.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

289,"2017-01-29",4.9,"Bottle dated 09/06/2016.
This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a dark brown color with a thin layer of off white foamy head dissipated at a good pace. No lacing.
The aroma had some sweet bourbon, vanilla, slight wood, lush plum sweetness, and a light tobacco quality (far underneath).
The flavor yields to the blend of the sweetness of the previously mentioned aromas with way less tobacco (seems barely there). Sweet plum to bourbon aftertaste strolling into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fair sipping quality about it. Mild carbonation, surprisingly enough given the date, I thought there would have been a tad more, but this was exceptionally smooth with zero cloying.
Overall, as much as I love Sucaba by Firestone Walker, as far as English barleywines this one just takes the cake. Apparently, the beer I want to die with in my hands.

289,"2016-02-27",4.7,"From notes. Enjoyed at the 3rd Annual Barleywine Tasting at Traviss house on February 20. 500 mL bottle. This one is also in discussion for the best beer of the night. This thing is magnificent. The pour is a dark brown, hints of garnet poking through. There is a nice thick medium khaki head that falls quickly to a collar, leaving no trace. The aroma is great. There is a big sweet malt up front with a nice bourbon to keep it in check. A light vanilla and caramel meld together nicely. There is a good sweetness that almost reminds me of molasses. The booze pokes back through on the finish, stronger than initially. The flavors are wonderful. There is a dark fruitiness up front, a little booze, and then the vanilla and caramel malts come roaring back. Its layered and delicious. The finish is a little boozy again, but the balance is just perfect. The mouth feel is thick and heavy with a soft carbonation that really lets it hang around. The aftertaste is lightly chocolatey, mostly dark fruits and caramel with a lovely bourbon singe that wraps it all up nicely. Im so glad I got to try this. Thanks Travis!

289,"2014-12-01",4.4,"Thanks! Obtained in a trade. Heard about Ameicans drooling about this one, so this one is a nice one to try. 500 ml. (looks like 375 ml.) bottle split with Kraddel. Bottled on 04/2014. Pours black, little tanned head only on the sides. Nose is thick bourbon & surprisingly lots of liquorish, heavy on sugar & spice, cacao. Taste is lots of sugar, dark fruits, light herbal & quite a bit of liquorish, bourbon is more subdued than expected, vanilla, thick prunes, molasses, lots of brown sugar, thick herbal. Body is thick but not overly so, not boozy either. Completely different from what I expected. Lots of unique flavours for the style here, prune, liquorish, fig, herbal etc. This isnt entirely what I prefer but I can respect this.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
289,"2014-11-30",3.9,"Bottle. Deep brown with a small head. Nose is rich wood and vanilla,
Cocoa. Some red apple. Almost a tangy fruity flavor. Red apple and cinnamon, toffee. Rich and sweet. Not overly hot. Very good.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
289,"2014-11-29",4.6,"Bottle pours with a nice opaque burnt copper body that supports a tan head of foam. The aroma is big yummy goodness. I get soft smooth kettle caramelization, brown sugar coated prunes and figs as well as slick soft bourbon and a flash of oak. The taste is similar as its seductive, rich, slick and soft with a bit of kettle caramelization and then bigger notes of nectar sweet malt drizzled marshmallow blended with thin ribbons of prune and fig like sweet fruity esters. Yum. Toward the finish soft smooth bourbon and supple and molasses sweetened oak come to the surface. Wow! This is bangin on all cylinders.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
289,"2014-11-28",3.9,"Good barleywine that seems a bit overhyped to me. Aroma is really nice with toffee, raisin, brown sugar, bourbon, and leather. Taste is very sweet with a lot of raisin and dark fruit with a bourbon booze finish. Complex and flavorful to be sure but really really sweet with raisin flavors and heavy bourbon. Good stuff.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"

289,"2014-11-25",4.3,"Bottle split 2 ways. Pours a chestnut color, amber hues. Low carbonation. Small tan head that fades to a ring, and then dissipates slowly. Aromas are bold bourbon, wet oak, vanilla, plums, dates, molasses and brown sugar. Taste follows the nose with an incredible balance of sweetness in the molasses/vanilla/dark fruit...and then some earthiness/nuttiness across the middle before the bourbon leaves a nice warming impression. While the alcohol is remarkably well hidden here, I have to venture a guess that this beer is in the 10.5%-12% abv range. Definitely boosted my buzz before I finished the glass! Great stuff, as is expected from Hill Farmstead.","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"

So smooth and so rich. Amazing. Flavor is just as silly as the aroma - loads of toffee malt, maple syrup, brown sugar, and bourbon. So big but so smooth and unbelievably not cloying.

Layer upon layer of of well structured silky goodness. Amazing integration of booze and sweetness. Maple syrup, cola, butterscotch, caramel, praline, nutty bourbon so soft and silky.

This is complex, but red-freaking-hot with alcohol. A long cellaring might really help this baby out. Five months wasnt enough. Cant say its not tasty now, though.

289,"2014-09-22",3.8,"Bottle shared by czar, thanks a lot LJ! Pours a medium brown with a small offwhite head that leaves low lacing. Nose is a sugar rush (toffee, maple syrup, brown sugar, you name it) but there is also some good dark fruits in there. Taste is also really sweet, a bit too much for me even. Flavors of caramel, raisins, bourbon and oak are to be found. Body was full, carbonation moderate and some alcohol could be felt but I figure way less than it actually contains. Overall a nice barleywine, not sure why but I may have put my expectations way too high on this one.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
289,"2014-09-22",3.9,"Bottle (500 ml). Shared by czar, thanks! Dark brown with mahogany reflects, a small beige head and no lacing. Aroma is of molasses, caramel, dark fruits, vanilla, bourbon and oak along a light nutty presence. Taste is moderately sweet with again molasses and caramel along dried raisins, vanilla, bourbon, oak and a moderate acidic presence. Full bodied. Moderate carbonation. Smooth and almost creamy mouthfeel. Light lingering vanilla finish. Alcohol is well hidden (though theres no mention of the abv on the bottle). Very good balance and complexity. I wasnt as impressed as my tasting partners, but its definitely a pretty good Barley Wine. I will have to revisit.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

289,"2014-09-10",4.4,"Un liquide sans aucun doute riche avec une surprenante effervescence saine. Pain aux raisins, mélasse, caramel rôti, tire dérable, cuirette et bourbon doux. Le corps est tout simplement indécent, pas certain davoir rencontré une telle corpulence. Moelleux, chatouillant presque avec ses petites bulles sans jamais embourber le palais, un tour de force sensoriel. Les saveurs suivent le nez avec des petits fruits très présent, des coulisses de beurre dérable et une vanilline omniprésente. La buvabilité est égale à sa grosseur, lalcool vraiment furtive.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
289,"2014-09-05",4.3,"Thanks to my friend Heather for sharing her glass with me. 

A - Pour is very murky brown woody with a very prune juice appearance which is of course the look of a barley wine so no surprise there. 1 finger milk chocolate head appeared and faded to a thin ring. 

S - Smell is walnut, chestnut, caramel, peanut, vanilla ice cream, figs, maple syrup and toffee. Very decadent aroma. 

T - Obviously whiskey up front, middle and at the finish. The whiskey is long lasting. Theres a lot going on here. Oak tannic vanilla is probably the most substantial and a walnut pistachio mix of nuttiness with rich figs covered in a sweet candy apple sugary taste. Theres a whole lot going on here. Maybe its slightly more sweet than I would prefer but thats my own fault. 

M - Mouthfeel is creamy, dense and oily with a bittersweet naked vanilla finish.

O - The long time in oak has done wonders to this beer. Its perfect right out of the gate. Sure itll change with time but this is ready to drink now. Reminds me of a lot of barleywines after I sit on them for a year after purchase. The 2 years in oak lends a slight oxidation, brings out the oak and vanilla and lets the flavors meld together really well.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
289,"2014-09-05",4.4,"Le liquide foncé, acajou pour ce quil me semble, avec la naissance courte ou la mort immédiate dun col mousseux plutôt beige. Un nez orgiaque dans lequel je pourrais bien me perdre pendant de longs moments. Une présence assez cochonne dune barrique caramélisée et vanillée. Des malts gargantuesques. Des raisins secs (et autres fruits) qui trempent dans une liqueur fabriquée, entre autre, avec des noix. Une coulée de sirop dérable et une trace de noix de coco grillée. Une douceur énorme confrontée à des vapeurs dalcool travaillées pour éviter lénormité. Ça sannonce bien! Un goût tout aussi intéressant mais un peu moins profond. Des tonnes de céréales liquoreuses. Un sucre assumé. Un bourbon bienheureux qui fignole les saveurs et qui enchante mes papilles. Un corps qui sinscrit dans la catégorie des poids lourds. Une texture riche et collante qui reflète la teneur en sucre et en alcool du liquide. Un pétillement très mou que je trouve bien adéquat. Une finale maltée brune, noire et fruitée, à mi-chemin entre le porto et autre fabuleux dessert de fin de soirée. En résumé, un vin dorge prêt pour jouer dans la cour des grands. Étonnamment facile à boire pour sa stature et pour sa capacité sucrée. Superbe intégration du fût de bourbon : la base de cette bière doit être tout simplement titanesque.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
