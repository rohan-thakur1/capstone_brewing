469,"2017-02-26",3.8,"Bottle shared by markoijelena at RBBWG. Loose, pale greyish beige, moussy head quickly reduced to a thin but steady rim around the edge, very dark chestnut brown robe, bordering on black, with hazy mahogany edges. Aroma of candied dates, bitter chocolate, roasted peanuts, vanilla, wodka, black pepper, hard butterscotch candy, cloves. Sweet onset, candied date and dried banana, sourish touch, softish carbo, slick and smooth, very supple body. Nutty bittersweet maltiness ensues, with a softer caramel edge; cinnamon- and clove-like spicy notes appear towards the finish, as well as a strong amount of heating, rum-like alcohol and spicy hop bitter accents. Interesting beer coming from a country that seems to be joining the international craft beer revolution lately, but lacking a bit in subtlety; especially the alcohol could have been better hidden.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

469,"2017-02-05",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2017 Re-rate in Kortrijk with Travlr and Joel. Bottle which was cellared for about a year. This one was much smoother than the first one, had nice and quite noticeable apple character, brandy was very subdued and subtle. Smooth and easy drinkable for 10%. Id still like a bit more body, but very good beer nevertheless. 
-------- 330 ml from Pivoteka. Shared with JFK10000. Pours dark brown, with medium brownish head. Caramel, sweetish, chocolate, some vanilla, brandy, light wood. Soft carbonation. Medium bodied. Warming. Not bad, but too much brandy supported by not that big body bothers me to some extent.

469,"2016-12-04",3.6,"Aug. 16. On tap at Craft Room, Zagreb. It poured a very dark brown body with a small tan head atop. Strong sweet aroma but rather fine, caramel to cocoa and cappuccino with toasted things in between, alcoholic like a whisky (yes, brandy, I see now), earthy and dusty. Flavor was sweet toasted malty with quite intense alcohol woody bite, practically followed the nose. With some extra vanilla. Brandy note seemed a bit over the top though. Fuller in body with moderately long caramel, coffee and cocoa finish, where an interesting light lactic note survived the most besides woody alcoholic one. Very decent, although a bit too intense altogether.","Split, CROATIA","heavy"

469,"2016-10-23",3.8,"Pours black color, clear, with tiny light brown head, which transforms itself to a ring around the glass. Aroma: gentle note of calvados- ""rakija"" (stone fruits, apples, hint of pear), supported with vanilla, dark chocolate...flavor: intense friuty (calvados) note, maybe even too dominant over malt backbone, which takes on dark chocolate, hint of vanilla, toasted caramel macchiato...finish is dry, with noticeable alcohol note, which reminds you that by this beer the border betwen stout and imperial stout is hidden or better: belong to no mans land: with character (also abv.) of imperial stouts but with body (gravity) of stouts.
