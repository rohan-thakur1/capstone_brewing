2788,"2014-01-03",3.4,"Szép, borostyán vörös színe van, habja világos bézs színű, elég termetes, dunnás és közepesen kitartó. Illata és íze karamellás, igen malátás, mézes, de ezekhez az édes jegyekhez hozzá csatlakozik egy szép adag virágos, szénás és zöldséges komló is. Könnyű, de nem vizes és elég buborékos. Utóíze keserédes, karamellás, kissé száraz. Nem rossz...","Budapest, HUNGARY","ogreface"

2788,"2013-03-13",3.7,"On tap at the restaurant (03/03/13). Rather clear amber pour, thick foamy white head. Aroma is caramel forward, as with the svetle but it somehow seems more fitting here, classic fruity and vanilla polotmavé notes as well. Taste of caramel, light toasted grain, light fruitiness, delicate. Palate is fluffy, definitely not one of the driest examples, but well attenuated nonetheless. Good.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2788,"2013-03-10",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Vanilla, caramel and butterscotch seep from this Polotmavys pleasant malts.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam covers the hazy dark amber.
-This one too feels like it was carbonated with a dose of nitrogen.
-This Polotmavys quite low on the hops.
-There isnt much depth here, but the flavor profile is highly pleasant.
-Mouthfeel is silky and creamy.

On tap at the brewpub.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
2788,"2013-01-01",2.8,"Live rating: 330ml bottle from a friend returning to England from Prague. Pours hazy amber with yellowish white thick head. Yeasty and mildly hoppy aroma with wood and savoury scents. Intensely sour citric tastes in-the-mouth; lemon/unripe fruit. Sweet-sour, primarily acidic finish on medium body and lightly zingy mouthfeel. Tingling sensation on the tongue for several moments between sips. Something of an effort needed to drink. I noticed on the bottle the following: Minimalni trvanlivost do 10.12.12. Does this mean it was two weeks past its drink-by date????","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","ladnewton"

2788,"2012-08-23",4.0,"On draught at the brewery tap / restaurant, so in optimum condition.  A classic Czech Polotmavy take on Vienna Lager, if such a style ever really existed.  Easily mistakable in palate for a north of England stronger bitter.  Dabs of caramel, a bit of barley sugar and enough hop to keep it from cloying.","Bristol, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","Tim Webb"
2788,"2012-08-14",2.7,"Draught at BBF12. Buttery aroma. Clear dark brown colour. Small tan head. The flavour is sweet and sugary with a hint of butter. Low to medium bitterness.","Sønderborg, DENMARK","MiP"
