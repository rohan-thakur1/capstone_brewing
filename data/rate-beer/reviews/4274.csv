4274,"2017-04-22",4.1,"3 finger white head that quickly dissipates to a 1 finger one. 
Beautiful hazy, deep orange coloured beer. 
Aroma is citrus, spice (wheat style) and a slight tropical hoppy nose. Really simple but very pleasant smell. 
Taste is an amplified version of the classic spicy, wholewheat bready lager maltbase. Sweet, wheaty and hoppy kick at the back. 
Smooth and easy to drink, whilst still having a full, nicely carbonated body. 
A bit sticky in the mouth. Mildly bitter. 
Overall: Beautiful lager. Probably the best lager Ive had yet. Could be heavier on the breadiness and bitterness to achieve a full score though. Perfect to most meals or just to enjoy by itself on a warm evening in the summer. 
Show them how its done, Nils Oscar!","Malmö, SWEDEN","EerieDrinks"
