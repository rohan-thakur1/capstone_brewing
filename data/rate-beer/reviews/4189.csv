4189,"2009-06-13",3.1,"***review from Jan 28, 2007***
Beer is garnet with brown touches and I did get a fairly big brown cap that unfortunately did not last and simmered down to a skim. Small ammounts of spotty lacing. Skim does hold throughout. Aroma is pretty obvious with the large ammount of malts. Huge toasted malts and some caramel. Seems warm. There is something that I cannot place that seems a bit too sharp, but it doesnt take too much away from all the malts. Thick and sweet with maybe, maybe almonds? Taste is very malty as well with the toastiness comming out. You can notice the alcohol that is closing in on being overpowering. There seems to be a bit of sourness - I am not sure where that is comming from - that is tied in with the alcohol. Possibly some hop flavour. A bit of caramel adds a touch of sweetness. Medium to full bodied. Little carbonation. Very strong mouthfeel. Lengthy toasted aftertaste with some lingering mellowing bitterness. I mostly enjoyed this but I found that the alcohol was to prominent, and at 7%, it shouldnt be.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"
4189,"2009-06-08",3.5,"Dark copper to brown with minimal head, I swear this cap has a slight green tinge to it, retention is good. Smell is sweet and caramely lots of dark malt and I think I can detect mild hops but not sure. I can smell some chocolate but its very faint, overall I think the aroma is a little too mild. Very rich and very malty so much rich malt I dont know what to do with it all, creamy coffee or possibly some dark chocolate making a good bitter flavor. Maybe its slightly to sweet but its still very good. High quality and yummy yet a other gem from Paddock Wood. Review done while watching house of flying daggers.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","Cirrhosis"
4189,"2008-04-16",3.6,"Poured a murky brown color with a small, light tan head that left light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of light oxidation, roasted malts, nuts, and caramel.  Taste was nutty, with caramel, light honey, cardboard, and some more sherryish oxidation.  Thanks Josh!","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
4189,"2008-04-15",4.0,"Thanks to Josh for sharing this one. Pours a mostly translucent brownish amber with golden notes and a smaller bubbly/creamy off whtie head.  Aroma of caramel, sweet grainy notes, fruity notes and toasty.  Flavor of molassess, vanilla, sweet malty grains, caramel and some light nuts.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
4189,"2008-02-07",3.7,"Thanks to CapFlu for the bottle!  Poured clear, healthy deep brown with a well-retained cap of deeper beige head.  The aroma was sweet and very enjoyable.. toasty caramel and nutty notes join drier chocolate.. prickly alcohol and herbal tones accent nicely.  The flavor had roughly the same components, but picked up a pervasive (but not entirely unpleasant) sourness.. well-caramelized base with lesser doses of nutty malts.. the finish was sour and warm, carrying through caramel.  Medium-bodied with ideal carbonation on the palate.. the sourness got in the way, and I wish I drank it a tad sooner.. very good stuff!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
4189,"2007-11-14",3.4,"Pours  dark with a small but smart head. Aroma contains alcohol, roasted barley, and reminds of a barleywine. The taste is a medium mouthfeel plus dunkle chocolate malt with a bit of roasted barley taste. Well offset by toffee malt for drinkability. Overall quite nice.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
4189,"2007-09-30",3.8,"Amber-brown colour.  No real head.  Fudgey, chocolatey, demerara aroma.  Rich, earthy palate with burnt cherry, alcoholic warmth midway, and  a sweet, earthy, brown sugar and fruitcake finish.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
4189,"2007-09-26",3.8,"Bottle @ TimEs House: Dark brown mahogany color, thin white head and some lacing. The nose is fruity and strong with some bright plum, licorice, light spice and sweet caramel. The flavor is intensely sweet and malty, lots of dark fruits and molasses, bright acidity in the finish to round it out too. Nice hoppy finish, excellent bock, a bit too sweet but the alcohol notes are absent and its clean enough for full mouth fulls. Good.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
4189,"2007-09-13",3.7,"Dark ruby brown, thin light tan head.
Aroma is caramel, chocolate, toffee, and cream.  Taste is a light caramel, a bit nutty, pretty interesting and pleasant.","Bakersfield, California, USA","Enniskillen"
4189,"2007-09-12",3.6,"A deep dark brown bock with a thin lacing light moka head. Nice caramel and plums in aroma, with light vinous and chocolate notes. In mouth, a sweet molasse bock with figs, licorice, nutty notes, metallic notes, but overall, enjoyable. Bitter chocolate develops in final. Thanks to PintbyPint, around March 2007.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
4189,"2007-09-09",3.9,"Pours brown with a tan head.  Sweet malts, cocoa, ginger bread cookiedough, some fruits, and roasted notes.  Flavor is malty, cocoa, roasted malts, molasses, some nutty, and dark fruit.  Medium, full body.  Very good, very solid bock.  Would love to have again.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"

4189,"2007-08-09",3.7,"A delicious really malty bock.  very copper coloured, intense malt flavour.  one of the best malty beers out there; if you like malty, youll love this one!","Beaumont, Alberta, CANADA","JoeZasada"
4189,"2007-06-08",3.8,"Bottle courtesy of CBA: Poured a cloudy dark brown color bock with a large foamy dirty brown color head with great retention. Aroma of sweet malt with some light ester is more powerful then expected by very enjoyable. Taste is quite sweet with some light ester notes and some roasted malt also noticeable. Body is full with some adequate carbonation and no alcohol was noticeable. I really appreciate this one and I find it is still a shame this brewer doesnt get more exposure.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
4189,"2007-05-24",3.8,"A very good beer. Very rich and fruity mouthful. If I can taste the hint of fig, without it being too sweet, then it is well done! I would highly recommend this beer.","Alberta, CANADA","Parksy"
4189,"2007-04-21",3.8,"Bottle:

My favorite drink....a single bock..how does this one stack up to expectations?

The Pour: Puts a deep brown lager with ruby highlights in the glass..nuce 2 finger sticky mocha cap lasts and laces the glass well.

Aroma is very nice...pungent..nig sweet bready malts, cocoa, figs, pipe tobacco light earthiness and some woody tones..full marks in the nose.

Big malts in the front end ..you litterally chew through amber and dark Munich ""liquid bread"" ..mid palate it becomes a taf more complex than a single bock is expected to produce...some charred treaclem choclate bundt cake, figs, fresh birchwood, some wonderful earthy tones...then the finish tends to dry up the drink with Noble variety hops providuing some medicinal/herbal bittering...decent bready after taste...like fresh toast...wunderbar!

Cetainly one of the better bocks that are now emerging in the Canadian Micro scene A good bock...but there are better in Canada...but not many!","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"
4189,"2007-02-07",3.8,"355ml brown bottle. Labelled as ""Bock"". Ruby-brown with a small dark beige head which recedes to a fine layer on the surface. Aroma of fruity malt, a bit of chocolate. Rich malt flavour with chocolate, dark cherry fruit with a hint of sourness and roasted notes. Some hops in the finish, dry with mild bitterness and roasted coffeeish aftertaste. Medium body.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","pintbypint"
4189,"2007-02-05",4.0,"WOW! This thing is like a malt sandwhich! Loaded with malt-- shovelfuls! Deliciously roasty, like toasted wheat, with a dry finish as promised. Full mouthfeel. Absolutely excellent-- Opptimator calibre even.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
4189,"2006-12-20",3.7,"Dark brown color, thisck white head. Milk chocolate, brandy, cherries in the nose. Light bodied. Slightly sour, milk chocolate, cherries, brandy in mouth, but overall too sour. Milk chocolate, cherries, wheaty finish. Good example of style, though I wish the sourness was toned down.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
4189,"2006-12-18",2.9,"licorice, caramel aroma. Copper brown pour with a thin head. Understated malt flavours that became harder to distinguish as I became more wasted. Must re-rate with a clearer head.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","TipsyMcStager"
4189,"2006-12-18",3.6,"""Warrior"" Bock. Mahogony with a light head. Coffee flavoured. Good body. Alcohol finish. A sweet dark beer.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
4189,"2006-11-27",3.5,"Bottle as Bock, 7%abv. Very dark brown body, moderate dark tan head. Aroma of raisins, dark sweet malt, and tart vinuous fruit. Surprisingly strong character of sharp vinuous strawberry or raspberry seeds that is oddly familiar - I wish I could place it. Its something I would expect more in a Belgian style than a German one.  Sweet and dry malts alternate in the background. Green chlorophyl like hints.  Medium palate has some gravitas yet remains light (3+). Caught me off guard at first but it is actually quite pleasant as the palate becomes acclimatized to it. Thanks to Felix for the pick up in Saskatchewan.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
4189,"2006-02-27",3.6,"(Bottle) Popped the cap and a tan cream approached then surpassed the rim. A nose of shaved German chocolate and rich malts act coy with my nose while the deep, deep ruby-coloured nectar envelopes my glass. The head heeds way to a semi-tanslucent foam top with an active number of minute bubbles skirting the glass. Though mildly tin, the vast flavour is of layers of malts - caramel, roasted peet, rotting wood and a vanilla bean and coffee grounds finish. Very good.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
