4389,"2015-09-05",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Toasted pumpernickel bread, chicory and coffee converge in this lean Schwarzbier.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the dark brown.
-Malts are very nicely developed in this one.
-This is not a generic Schwarzbier, which I appreciate.
-Drinkability is appropriately high.
-Carbonation is perhaps too soft.

4389,"2015-08-01",4.4,"Excellent dark beer; not bitter, has an inviting aroma that does not disappoint once you take your first sip. For a dark beer from a tiny little brewery in Shreveport, LA, its an awesome brew. Best on tap. Not as good in the can. Not available in the bottle.","","RebelSaint"
4389,"2015-05-31",3.6,"Can and tap but right now a can. Went to Shreveport for business and was pleasantly surprised in all aspects, including beer scene. This guy is a stout of a lager. Chocolatey and nutty but smooth as a lager should. Kive the can labeling.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"

4389,"2014-12-25",4.0,"From tap at brewery and in 12 oz. can at home. Reasonably Corrupts aroma is earthy and rich like a traditional Schwarzbier but a hop note that makes it original. The beer pours to a platinum black with an average tan colored head with average lacing. The taste of Reasonably Corrupt is a medium bitter rich semi-sweet chocolate and the German hops touch it off to an earthy black loveliness. To the palate this Schwarz is smooth with light carbonation, a slightly oily texture and solid full body. The finish is a light rich bitterness that will you have you ready for the next drink. This is one to really enjoy on tap but the cans lend nicely to sample to friends and out-of-town people that do not get a chance to enjoy Great Raft.","Haughton, Louisiana, USA","mtravis63"

The flavor is very clean with a light roasty malt on the back of the tongue. Well carbonated, enhances the flavors. Overall I really enjoyed this beer and am sure I will be having more. This is the 3rd time Ive drank this beer and it is improving with every batch they make (I believe this is the 3rd batch of RC they have brewed), keep it up Great Raft!","North Dakota, USA","GreatDane1632"
