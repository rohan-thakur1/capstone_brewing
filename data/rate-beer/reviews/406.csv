406,"2016-10-14",3.5,"Draft from Growler Country while escaping Hurricane Matthew. Darker than expected with an amber color and thin tan head. Very pleasantly sweet aroma that reminds me of caramel candy cubes. Nice flavor of malt and caramel. Maybe a hint of the higher ABV (8+ compared to 5 in the regular) in the finish. Nice.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BelgianBeerGal"

406,"2014-09-16",3.7,"Pours a deep caramel amber color with two fingers of eggshell foam. The nose is a bit of caramel, vanilla, fuji apple and toasted bread. Palate is true to its name... caramel cream sauce with some nuances of vanilla bean, oatmeal, hint of grain and shredded wheat. Slightly sweet but not overbearing with a well placed slight bitterness to clean up the finish. Adult cream soda at its finest.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
406,"2014-08-14",4.1,"I am quickly becoming a cream ale fan especially if I find any more like this one. Hazy golden, bubbly lace, caramel without being sweet or cloying. Seriously and dangerously (abv) drinkable.","Florida, USA","delacerveza"

406,"2014-02-18",3.5,"draft at the brewery. wow, holy aroma. a sugary and vanilla bomb, like a waffle cone. a little alcohol noted. candy like and well done if you are into sweet sugary beer.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
406,"2013-11-04",2.8,"Medicine bottle growler thanks to richiesd. Pours a clear amber, weak foam with odd white oil bead looking floaties in the glass. Nose is caramel, sweet orange candies, sweet juice box. Taste is sticky, mild hop bite, medicinal orange cough syrup. Palate is papery, near tangy lemon. Odd.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
406,"2013-10-05",2.8,"On draft for Due South Oktoberfest. Pours a deep amber color with medium tan head. Sweet malt aroma and lots of caramel. Sweet malt in the flavor as well and caramel present, first few sips tastes like caramel corn actually. Some diacetyl is present...buttery notes and big slickness. Overall pretty good.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","DrewFace"
406,"2013-10-02",3.4,"Growler extra from hopscotch. Pours with translucent dark amber with very small head. Aroma is caramel malt, medium body, low carbonation, creamy texture, and little lacing. Taste is caramel malt, caramel, some vanilla, and balancing grassy hops. Pretty good.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"
406,"2013-08-15",4.0,"Draft... This beer rocks! Clear, lovely copper ale with a dirty-orange sparkle and a small, creamy, off-white head. Decent retention. The aroma is what I had hoped for  loads of caramel and vanilla with only a hint of toasted grains. Full-bodied with a lightly creamy mouthfeel and tingly carbonation. The flavor is sweet, but sufficiently hopped  buttery, rich gobs of caramel and toffee are nearly countered by a faint, mildly bitter, earthy hop note. Finishes bittersweet, caramely and faintly grassy. The relatively high abv is not at all evident, but no bonus points for that, because I like to feel and taste the alcohol in my liquor. This brew is surprisingly great. A real, world-class treat! Surprisingly great, due to the thinness and overall lack of flavor in their standard Caramel Cream Ale.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
406,"2013-07-27",3.8,"Growler thanks to Hopscotch, another Florida Tick Eric! Aromas of caramel, toast, and some light vanilla. Flavors are big caramel, toast, and some light earth. The caramel and vanilla flavors was nice light booziness in the aftertaste, a solid beer, thanks Eric.","Florida, USA","burg326"
406,"2013-07-20",3.7,"Tap. Moderate caramel and light bread for the malt, light orange and dough for the hops and yeast, with background notes of brown sugar, vanilla and cola. Head is large, creamy, slightly off-white with excellent lacing and is mostly lasting. Color is deep mahogany. Flavor starts lightly to moderately sweet and lightly acidic, then finishes lightly sweet and bitter. Palate is is on the fuller side of medium, creamy with a soft carbonation. This Cream Ale is a bigger hit than its weaker cousin, but its still a bit girlie for me.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"
406,"2013-07-17",3.8,"On draft at Tap42. Its been a long time since Ive tried the regular Caramel Cream from Due South so its sort of hard to compare the two. This one was very tasty and easy to drink. ABV is masked very well, no heat whatsoever.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
