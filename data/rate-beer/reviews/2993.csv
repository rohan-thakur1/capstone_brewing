2993,"2011-10-16",2.5,"IH street legal... pale yellow, clear, small white head, ok lacing... distinct adjunct, sweetness, beats the macros but certainly should be catagoriezed with them... srong for strongs sake, medium full sweetness adds body, eh... 4 4 4 4 9","West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA","jeff789"
2993,"2008-10-12",1.5,"Aroma was alcohol and malt, much like other malt liquor accept it didn’t have that gasoline edge to it.  pours golden color with head that quickly dissipates.  flavor is alcohol and muted malt and no hops.  light bodied.  Weird beer.","Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, USA","jehoey"
2993,"2008-10-05",2.0,"[Phoenixville, PA] Poured a golden color with a small, white head that left light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of corn, toast, notes of citrus, and alcohol.  Taste of grains, honey, citrus, corn, metal, and alcohol.  A bit sweeter and rougher than some other craft brewed malt liquors.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
2993,"2008-10-04",2.7,"On tap at Pville loco yo!  Pours a crystal clear piss yellow with a smaller bubbly white head that went away quickly.  Aroma of corn, alcohol, pretzels, grains, and malt sweetness.  Flavor of grains, corn, sweet up front, apple juice, sweetness lingers, some alcohol in flavor as well.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
2993,"2008-10-01",2.1,"Golden color with a heavy boozy-corn aroma.  Flavor is heavy, cornish, and a bit like cough syrup.  Not bad for the style, but a little rough.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
2993,"2008-09-08",2.2,"(On tap in Lancaster) Can taste the alcohol strongly.  A bit sour.  Tastes kinda like what you’d expect from a beer that seems to be cultivating a ""malt liquor"" image, but I thought it was actually good for what it was.  A bitter aftertaste, but not much in the way of hops.  I enjoyed the amount in the sample glass but I’m not sure I’d want to drink a whole one of these.  It seems strange and a bit ironic that a microbrewery that tries to have a classy image would brew a corn-adjunct malt liquor like this one though.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","cazort"
2993,"2008-08-19",3.2,"Draft at IHL.  This is one of the top 2 malt liquors I have ever had.  I know that isn’t saying much, but try this one and I think you’ll like it.  It is golden with fluffy white head, nose is pale malt (not corny at all), hops, citrus, honey, and fruit.  Tastes great, with a complex, full bodied palate, and a mix of honey maltiness and hopcitric fruit.  Well done.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
2993,"2008-08-12",3.2,"Draft in Lancaster. Poured a pale yellow in color with a large white head that left a nice lacing on the glass. Aroma of corn on the cob, off the cob, corn meal, creamed corn and corn dog without the dog. wow.  Taste is basically the same.  Lots of corn and fairly sweet. Surprisingly when a malt liquor is over the top like this, I actually enjoyed it. Well done for what it is.","Silver Spring, Pennsylvania, USA","Miver"
2993,"2008-07-21",2.1,"UPDATED: JUL 23, 2008 The beer was a sample I got on draught.  There was a nice head on it and a decent carb even though it was a small glass.  The beer is very hot from alcohol and definately has some strength to it.  The flavor and aroma are overwhelmingly of corn, I compared it to Kix ceral.  The beer is very sweet, which I did not expect and there is almost no hoppiness.  This is definately a beer that I didnt enjoy much and probably could not drink a pint on my own...it is just too cloying.","Columbia, Pennsylvania, USA","machfive55"
