4406,"2017-05-26",3.5,"Draft at taproom. Pours black with a khaki head. Leaves trace lacing in the glass. Has some roasted malt on the nose. Has kind of a licorice, smoked thing on the tongue. Finished clean. Very quaffable.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
4406,"2017-04-22",4.3,"Pours a rich black with a chocolate milkshake head, rich roasty and chocolate aroma is also present on the palate, with a slight hint of some smokiness as the beer warms. Very well balanced, great beer.","East Falmouth, Massachusetts, USA","Quick3Beers"
4406,"2017-03-04",3.4,"Draft at Taproom 307 with Linh, Unlce Jim & Aunt Chris and the Canavan boys. Pours a deep brownish black body with thick off white lacing. Nose is rich cocoa and milky roast. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with notes of cocoa, chocolate milk, gentle sugars, soft roast and round malt. Nice active hop profile towards the back end as well. Nice enjoyable schwarzbier.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
4406,"2017-02-25",3.6,"Bottle. Nose inky dark chocolate and oaty-smooth coffee roast, a very mild nuttiness with great malt foundation. Pour is near-pitch in the glass, just a smidgen of brown at the bottom, with a rock and dense light brown head. Fullish body touch of acridity, which I like here, good dark roast with more of that nutty-grainy deliciousness, a bit thick and airy overall but only minorly bitter, no astringency, touch of spice, light bitterness in the short aftertaste. This is a tweener, halfway between the poles of black lager, not brutal but also not utterly smooth, with more hop presence than is usual in Germany. Real fun one to drink, though, a mature recipe and just a subtle deviation from a set-it-and-forget it porter. [2017.02.25: 3.6]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
4406,"2017-02-09",3.3,"12oz bottle poured into can shaped glass. Black beer with tan head. I should have known from the appearance. I have had a few recent very nice examples of black lagers but this doesnt reach that bar. Aroma is lagered fumy black malts. Flavor follows suit but turns upside down with a big patent malt bitter finish. The long, dry papery finish really makes the beer less appealing. Too much black patent malt but well lagered otherwise. Could use some malt sweetness.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
4406,"2017-01-19",3.7,"black color; nice roasted malt aroma; smooth, clean, roasted malt flavor; coffee notes; well balanced","Beckley, USA","BeerdedDave"
4406,"2017-01-15",3.6,"Delicious schwarzbier. I wish more brewers would make this style. Aroma wa descent. Dark roasted malt, light coffee and just a hint of chocolate. Pour was a nice deep dark brown/black with a thin tan film for a head. Taste was delicious. Coffee, roasted malt, a little toffee and a nice crisp hitter finish. Nice strong carbonation. I forget sometimes how tasty a lager can be.","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
4406,"2017-01-13",4.8,"Nice roasted barley smell with hints of chocolate hits the nose just right. Black as night in color with almost no head look like old oil awesome. Rich deep malt flavor with hint of dark coffee and chocolate notes throughout. Full body feel with nice carbonation which was surprising for how small the head was. Awesome brew hits all the points a dark brew is suppose to nice work.","milton, Vermont, USA","polo_marco"
4406,"2017-01-07",2.7,"Sampled from a 12 oz brown bottle this beer poured a black color with a small foamy dark brown head that left decent lacing. The aroma was woody and a touch smoky with roasty malts, floral hops and coffee. The flavor was bitter, dry and roasty with smoke, coffee and floral hops. Long finish. Medium body. Meh.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"
4406,"2016-12-30",3.6,"Bottle. Pours opaque dark brown with largish beige foamy head, faint cherry/roasted malt aroma, high carbonation, bitter nutty coffee beans taste with a hint of berries, thin body, long medium bitter finish. Nice, complex brew.","New York, TURKEY","trapped"
4406,"2016-12-29",3.5,"Bottle. Pours a rich deep murky brown black. Lager and dark roasted malt aroma. Flavor of brown sugar, caramel, and mild roast coffee. Very smooth and clean finish.","Rochester, New York, USA","Ron"
4406,"2016-12-22",3.8,"Really good German dark. Smoky nose, with dark chocolate. Taste is charred, mouthfeel is dry, then thick. Has a touch of licorice along with dark chocolate, and a dry smoky coffee filled finish. Really liked it.","Rochester, New York, USA","jb"
4406,"2016-12-22",2.5,"Rare beer at industry public house, thank you. Big & black. Gentle stout aroma. Flat for the most part, needs more co2. JMHO. Some bitter burnt wood in there. A tad medical overall. Yes, bitter alky is present. Fer sure. Probably a little too medicinal for its own good.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"
4406,"2016-12-20",4.0,"Poured into a lager glass, the appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a one finger sustaining off white to tan foamy head that as it dissipated some subtle rings of lace evenly stuck around the sides of the glass. Spider webbed very nicely!
The aroma started off with a superb blend of the roasty dark and milk chocolate malts flowing extremely nicely over the German lager yeast pulling out some graininess.
The flavor copies the aroma pretty much right on par and adds a dry little sweetness from the dark chocolate. German lager yeast seems to fade a bit, but the graininess comes back pulling the roasty quality nice and on into the middle of the beer. Roasty edged and grainy aftertaste somewhat evenly flowing into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium in body with a fair sessionability about it. Some carbonation feels there with a touch of the grain hitting in a prickly sort of fashion.
Overall, I say this was a pretty good schwarzbier that Ithaca pulled off. Way to go, guys!","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
4406,"2016-12-16",3.8,"Bottle sample at Dominion Wine & Beer, thanks Tyler! Dark brownish black with sparse tan head. Aromas of dark chocolate, roast, malt. Tastes of roasty notes, dark chocolate, grains, malt. Medium body with a dry finish. Pretty good.","Falls Church, Virginia, USA","GenDV138"
