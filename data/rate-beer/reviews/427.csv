Its coffee and cream ale, but its also like coffee and cream, in ale. In fact, thats what it smells like: vague beery aroma and coffee with cream. Flavor is more beer like, but the coffee elements are there. Also a nuttiness. Tending dry, fizzy. Weird funky notes at the end are the primary complaint, I cant quite place it - but its almost tart. Drinkable but I have mixed feelings about that finish.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

427,"2017-03-06",2.5,"Not sure how wise a pairing a coffee cream ale is beyond its aptness ; C.R.E.A.M. kinda ranks as more notable curiosity than good beer. Nose is pretty flat, grainy with a lager-ish burnt hair undertone, and the pour is amber-orange with little head and no lace. Tastes...strange, the corn-laced cream ale sweetness rubbing against the coffee acidity in a way that benefits neither. Almost develops a cherry barbecue sauce roasty undertone not fit for man nor beer. Finishes like smoked apple juice with a mild bitter backside. Weird. Very, very weird.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

Small, off-white, soapy foam. 2/3FLAVOR: Mild blonde malt flavor and sweetness. Coffee presence is noticeable throughout, but comes through strong on the finish. More of a roasted coffee taste than any kind of sweet iced coffee flavor. No hop character. Nothing to the palette indicative of a cream ale; seems closer to a generic blonde.

427,"2016-03-15",1.8,"Dark golden brew that is dominated by a bitter coffee smell. Wanted to add a bit of sugar to it based on the aroma and then when I tasted it, yep it could have used a bit of sugar. This is very Columbian dark roasted coffee flavor that just needs something to cut the bitterness. While interesting the choice of coffee flavor is just not doing it for me. 5 more to slurp down so hopefully with the 7%abv they will taste better as each one is downed.","Temple, Texas, USA","dlihcsnatas"

427,"2016-02-11",3.9,"BB 11 Jul 2016.
This was poured into a pint glass.
The appearance was a semi-hazy burnt orange color with a slim fingers worth of foamy white head that quickly dissipated. Remnants of filmy white lacing roamed around the glass.
The aroma smelled like cold pressed espresso moving delicately over top of sweet creamy notes of a blonde ale. Yes, I do believe that I do get a little bit of sweet corn as it warms.
The taste was pretty much the same but barely any of the sweet corn. Light sweet coffee aftertaste slides into a semi-wet sort of finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a good sessionability about it. Carbonation feels good, pretty low allowing the creaminess to lay down softly on my tongue. Coffee portion is smooth.
Overall, so this seems to be a cross between a blonde ale and a cream ale, I guess? With Sixpoint adding some coffee in to balance and enliven. Id say they did a really nice job just by combining two unpopular styles. Id have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

427,"2016-02-05",3.7,"Can, shared by me... in my dining room... just now.
So this one pours an orange color with a big head and lots of lacing on the glass.

The aroma is lots of coffee & a good bit of malt. Its lightly sweet smelling and very pleasant. 

Ok so the flavor is really appealing to me... that said its also a really strange beer. Coffee, plenty of coffee flavor here rich, roasty, bitter, great. Enough about the damn coffee though... this also reminds me oddly of the flavor of a Bourbon Soda with Bitters.... I mean it doesnt taste that much like bourbon but theres that sweetness & vanilla and malt thing going on along with the bitterness and just I mean I cant explain it completely but Ive had about 1,200 Bourbon & Sodas and this just has a likeness that I can not put my finger on completely to that cocktail.

427,"2016-02-01",3.1,"12 oz. can purchased at Spruce Creek Provisions, Kittery. Do you yourself a favor, DONT drink Ballast Point Calm Before the Storm right before this. It just isnt fair. Clear blonde / amber in color with no head. Aroma has a weak amount of coffee bean, caramel candy, maybe straw. 
Even when warm the flavor seemed a bit lack luster. I know it wasnt fair comparing Calm before the Storm to this brew but even after I let it warm; the only flavor at all was mild ground coffee. The mouthfeel lacks the signature creaminess people look for in the style. Perhaps carbonation was just off for some of this batch?? Overall for a Cream Ale I think I would rather just drink Sweet Action from this brewery. Also, I am a coffee lover. Any of my friends would tell you so. Just not feeling this.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
