4052,"2017-04-26",3.7,"Robe bien orangée et juteuse. Tête abondante qui tient peu et dont aucune trace nest visible sur mon verre. Nez totalement orienté Citra avec une douce profondeur des malts. En bouche le liquide est mince. Lattaque est bel et bien conforme au houblon et tombe rapidement avant quune longue amertume prenne le relais. Bulle énergique qui allège un corps déjà mince. Quelques rapports plus tard, la cannette est déjà vide.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

GLASSWARE: HopDevil nonick... from a growler filled six hours ago at the Liquor Factory in Jefferson... wow--a dense, opaque, light amber body with a snow white head that holds a two-fingered creamy thickness... the upper part of the head arcs in coral-like beauty... 100% Citra hops frame the grapefruit and melon well, with some background dankness and light cracker...quite a light aroma, welcoming and appropriate for such a beautiful night.... the mouth feel is smooth and creamy, with a simple, soft effect at the teeth and a balanced finish at its end... highly drinkable, not betraying its 5.2% ABV... for a pale ale, the brewers proclamation is true: this beers hops tower explode withe grapefruit, watermelon, lemon and orange peel--a veritable buffet of citric flavors... a brewery that attempts a singular profile is refreshing--and this one is refreshing as it is... the citrus almost puckers the lips, but overall, flavorful and drinkable...","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"

Taste is about the same as the aroma. Has a medium body with a semi creamy mouthfeel and a semi dry, semi-moderately bitter, medium-long finish.

Notes are ultra dank citra which seems to be the case these days...borders on galaxy and nelson flavors. Also a good bit of caramel bread and a slightly weird note. Drinkable compared to the rest of the list but not great. Tried again on 1/22/16.....amazing batch with orange juice and a touch of mango. Moved up a good bit. Another batch,,,,tangerine orange pussy juice. Moved up even more, since augie cant get ""good"" boat to me Im only drinking this now","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"

4052,"2015-08-16",3.2,"Growler from brewery. Pours like orange or carrot juice. Cloudy to the point of looking like something is wrong with it. Luckily it smells and tastes great, with lots of bright citrus and some light grassiness. Good.","","conway"
4052,"2015-08-15",3.7,"Growler from Kane. Not a pretty pour haha, very murky, like the bottom of a fermenter. The taste had a lot of citrus on the acidic side and soft malts making up the medium body. Great stuff. - not your standard take on a single hop citra pale.
