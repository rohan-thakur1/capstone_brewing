653,"2017-03-22",3.8,"(22oz. bottle) - Pours no head going into the glass. But, foams up a little. Black opaque body. Light non-descript aroma. Clean, but nothing to write home about. Thick mouth feel. Lots of sweetness. First flavor that comes out is milk chocolate, which morphs towards bitter chocolate after youve swallowed it. Some bready flavors like whole wheat bread. Honestly, I could drink this again and again, though thats going to be pretty hard since they shut their doors abruptly last week. Sad....","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"
