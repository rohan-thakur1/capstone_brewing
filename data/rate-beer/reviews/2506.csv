2506,"2014-04-24",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Guava-like tropical fruitiness runs through well-defined cereals, as mineral bubbling and delicate herbal hop bitterness take care of the finish.

-A slim slice of foam tops the misty straw blond.
-Citrusy fruitiness permeates the flavor profile.
-Mouthfeel is crisp and highly quenching.
-Im sure these guys could do a smashing Pilsener now.

2506,"2013-12-18",3.6,"Pours a cloudy darker yellow, slightly orange, decent white bubbly head with spotty lace and a bit of retention. Nose is all Nelson Sauvin, quite strong with no malt to obscure it. Slightly white wine-like acidity, gooseberry, lime and maybe a bit of grapefruit, fresh grass, slight green garlic. Very impressive fresh hop character for a light beer. On the palate the hops are again dominant, but the lightness of the beer much more apparent. Flavours are pretty similar to the aromas though the balance is tilted more towards citrus rind/pith at the beginning and in the middle there is a faintly sour/tart plus garlic/onion character before the citrus takes over again. A bit of kiwi as well. The malts are very plain with no sweetness, a little grain, crackery and dry on the finish. Low bitterness, mild flavor on the finish though there is a bit of hop/grain aftertaste. Carb is moderate, body light and lightly watery as expected for the ABV. Ill admit that the idea of a low alcohol session beer isnt really for me. I prefer a mix of moderate to high alcohol beer and water in separate glasses, rather than together. That said, on its own merits as a light beer, this is quality stuff and the aroma extraction from the hops is as good as a typical APA.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"
