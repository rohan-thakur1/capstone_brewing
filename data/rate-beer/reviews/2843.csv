2843,"2017-02-11",3.7,"A lovely old bit of pilsner this. Not hop bitey or overly green or grassy but honestly solid and delicious..","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","Pdubyah"
2843,"2016-07-10",3.5,"Pours lively but settles with a loose wash of white. Brilliant, pale gold body with a fine bead. Pear and lemon drops, grass, pine resin, toasted grains, palest honey and eucalypt on the nose - pleasant. Chilled it is lean to thin but as it warms it does open a shite load. The aroma plays here well. Lemon and pear candi sits balanced to the light honey, toasted and sun-drenched grains followed by a peppery hop finish. Lightly bitter but it just flits an appearance and then disappears. Crisp. Light bodied. Slightly alkaline in feel with sprightly carbonation. Clean overall and very approachable. A nice pilsner and good to see Epic released the likes of this! (50cL, BB 17/07/16, The Liquor Shed, Jandakot)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

2843,"2016-06-21",3.6,"2016-05-17. Crisp yellow body small white head and lace. 3+ Aroma is mild, light sweet lemon and muted malt. Flavour is pleasant, lemony hops, light pale malt. Smooth average to light bodied palate, soft carbonation. Refreshing and quite nice after two less stellar beers that preceded it. 7/3-4/7/3/15-16 On tap at Fork and Tap, Arrowtown, NZ.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
2843,"2016-05-16",3.1,"On tap at Alehouse Project, pours a clear golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out biscuity malt and maybe a touch of grassiness. Flavour is fairly bland, with biscuity malt and only a touch of grass. Pretty light and restrained, but very clean. Decent, but lacks oomph - I dont understand the high ratings.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2843,"2016-01-26",3.7,"Mild lemony and peppery aroma. Light and spicy on the tongue with citrus and a bit of pineapple and lime and some sweetness. Hoppy. Good.","OSHAWA, Ontario, CANADA","GlennHendry"
2843,"2015-12-20",3.9,"A pleasant ""New World"" Pilsner from NZ with a fine peppery spicy dry hop bitterness balancing a sweet pilsner malt backbone. Also some citrusy lime and tangerine notes in there as well. Palate is thirst quenching and quaffable with a medium-light body and easy carbonation. Appears clear straw yellow with a fluffy white head that reduces to a stable film. (500ml bottle from Beer Cartel with BB 17/7/16).","FNQ, Australia, ","floydian1"
2843,"2015-12-12",3.9,"Just a great summer beer. Not too over the top with pineapple notes. Cleansing and banana and cloves muted over a passionfruit spritzy base. Very nice indeed.","Canberra ACT, AUSTRALIA","madquacker"
2843,"2015-12-11",4.5,"Modern spin on classic Pilsner, ticks all the boxes in the right places too. Crystal clear golden yellow fantastic packed white  top, wonderfully aromatic with a pin sharp delicate bitterness. Try a selection of Pilsners blindfolded and this one surely stands out, brilliant idea and well thought out beer.","Ormeau, AUSTRALIA","bmeup"
2843,"2015-10-04",3.5,"Bottle from Wine Emporium 041015. it might look like a pilsener but it surely doesnt smell or taste like one. Lots of passionfruit in the aroma, flavour and finish, which is also a bit dry.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"
2843,"2015-07-18",3.6,"What. Is. It? Bottle. Pale gold with a white head that leaves nice rings of lace. Aroma of lime leaf, grapefruit, gooseberries, lychees, lemon pudding, hay. Rippling Kiwi hops. Soft texture is maybe a little on thin side. Some crackers and berries support citrus and tropical fruit. Moderate bitterness. Nice but doesnt live up to that first whiff.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
2843,"2015-07-14",3.9,"A Pilsner you say? Or a New Zealand IPA on a Pilsner malt? Who cares? A horse by any other name and all that. This is delicious. Who doesnt like lime and grapefruit on a pilly malt?","North Shore, Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","DylansDad"

2843,"2015-06-03",3.6,"One of the best Pilsners I have tried, although it is not my favourite style. Definitely good for a session as it doesnt beat the liver and the tongue as most other Epic brews so happily do. Citrus with a fairly short bitter end","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","tombutlin"
2843,"2015-05-31",3.6,"I had a few spare hours and the excellent company of the Impish brewer himself to enjoy a couple of pints of this in. Its a gorgeous yellow pint with just a tinge of green to it. It also has a bright white head, a riot of carbonation apparent and perfect clarity. The aroma was driven heavily by lime peel and grapefruit. It also carried a certain sage-like herbal character that added a shaft of complexity that carried through to the flavour. 
There was a certain air of ""Why the fuck not?"" when I asked the impish brewer why he went for a pilsner when his chosen sphere of expertise are generally IPAs and flavour heavy stouts, and that was good enough for me. I had a couple of pints. I could have happily had more. Many more. I was short of time, but not inclination.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
