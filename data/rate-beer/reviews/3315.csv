3315,"2017-04-12",3.2,"Tap @ at the hotel. Pours hazy golden with a white head. Aroma is lemon, grassy, slight melon, very grassy herbal, slight tee notes. Rather bitter, perfumen/foral, rather dry and bitter, seems quite dusty, harsh bitternes, quite stale, with a note of marzipan.","Odense C, DENMARK","MrOrla"
3315,"2017-02-07",3.1,"Sampled at the Weisser Schwahn (draft).
Very nice off white head. Cloudy amber color. A bit sweet caramel taste and a bit low bitterness.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","TEJA"
3315,"2017-01-20",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Bready cereals are diversified by orangey hops in this soft and süffig Zoiglbier.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the misty pale amber.
-Drinkability is very high.
-This one might not have much of a personality, but what it does it does well.
-Mouthfeel is dryish and bubbly, perhaps too much so for this type of bready/toasty flavour profile.

3315,"2017-01-13",3.6,"On tap at Weisser Schwan Windischeschenbach. Hazy amber colour lasting cream head. Some malt some amber malt some hop on the finish. The most full in the mouth so probably the best today. Some sherbet sting on the finish.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

3315,"2015-12-12",1.8,"Finally posting my review after drinking multiple (and perplexing!) glasses over the years: first in 2009 (upper 3s) and, most recently, several times in late Nov. 2015: Hazy golden orange. Tightly packed, but broken, white foam. Defective nose of vinegar, applesauce, mildew, and candy corn. Merely a hint of toast and flowers. Soft and snug carbonation. Quite tacky and cheesy, initially, which suggests diacetyl infection. Cheesiness covers the palate with an annoying film, as vinegary acids and soured pear astringency worsen things. Beneath all the off notes, a refined maltiness of deep, smooth toast exudes. Even some melanoidins poke through, amazingly enough. Finishes flabby with rotting fruit and strong acidity. Frankly, this is too difficult to drink to make much of a more detailed assessment. Either way, its severely unclean and undrinkable. 

Its worth noting that multiple liters were consumed a year or so ago during a very memorable session, and this beer scored in the low 4s. When in proper condition, its bright and minerally, with some claylike yeastiness and an unforgettable airiness and sherbety characteristic to go along with an abundance of elegant Hallertau and very cleanly extracted malt. Probably the cleanest zoigl I have tasted to date, in fact. Also worth mentioning is the following morning before leaving, the beer was unrecognizably infected and much murkier, ultimately undrinkable. So, while this beer has only performed favorably two times out of a half dozen times or more, Im gonna keep my low score as these are a more representation  of my most recent experiences.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3315,"2015-05-27",3.1,"Vom Faß im Weißen Schwan, 21.5.2015. - Braungelb, leicht trüb. - Nase nicht allzu kräftig herbfruchtig-hopfenwürzig mit schwachen Karamelnoten. - Antrunk von schlanker, herb fruchtiger Hopfigkeit (Orangenschale) mit hopfenwürzigen Noten. Schwach karamelsüß. Etwas dünner Körper, mild rezent aber mehr Kohlensäure als andere Zoiglbiere. Im Abgang nicht sehr kräftige, herbe aber aromatisch etwas leere Hopfenbittere. - Schwächerer Zoigl: deutlich zu stark karbonisiert, etwas matt gehopft und auch ein wenig dünn. Kein Vergleich mit den besseren Windischeschenbacher Zoiglbieren. 
The description says this Zoigl is brewed by Robert (Sperber) from Beim Binner. If this is true, then Mr Sperber brews two distinctly different Zoigl beers, the better one for himself and a lesser one for the Weißer Schwan.","Beijing, CHINA","Moravius"

Thats the experience when its ""on"", but Ive had it in bad shape so many times that I have to lower my score... they have a problem with cleanliness where the beer smells like dish rag and white vinegar, and its happened more than once.
