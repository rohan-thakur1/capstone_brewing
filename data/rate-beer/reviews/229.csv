229,"2015-05-25",3.7,"I got this in a 650mL bomber. The pour was golden straw with nice active effervescence resulting in a decent sized off-white head that subsided quickly and left a nice lacing around the glass. Carbonated but not fizzy, this had grassy bready notes on the nose and a pleasant mouthfeel. Slightly more than watery, which is how I like my Kölsch style ales. The taste was mildly peppery and grassy with a nice not too-bitter aftertaste of nutty citrus. I enjoyed this more than my last Kölsch actually from Köln.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","CrookedNine"

229,"2014-06-08",3.1,"Golden colour, chill haze, fairly large bubbles for a craft beer and medium-thick head. The aroma is a bit grainy, with some damp dog-smelling noble hops. Moderate bitterness, though hop character isnt super fresh. The malts are pale, and a touch gooey (though one or two indigenous kölsch also have that character. Finishes with more of those malts and some bitterness. The sense of balance is quite good but the individual elements arent all that bright.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
229,"2014-05-07",3.5,"Where and how:  bottle 650 ml CBA 
Aroma frontal softness, floral, hint of wheat(?). Nice zesty floral hop touch. Pleasant nose. Perhaps tad too soft for traditional Kolsch.
 Appearance : 
Top: plus sized bright white cap.
Base: slight haze, golden.
Palate :  medium bodied, up front soft with dry sides. 
Taste: clean mid sitting golden malt with lingering bitterness above.
 Other notes  maybe tad soft for style, still quite tasty brew.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"

229,"2014-04-29",2.3,"Bomber. Cloudy yellow, not much head (the cap was pretty loose... its not stale though). Nose is kolsch lemon/orange/pear, grass, pils malt. Flavour is pretty rounded pear and pils, carb is pretty low, good until the finish which is slightly harsh and quite medicinal. The finish comes out of nowhere. Phenol problem. Hard one to rate;  best not to overthink it and make an ass of myself.","Phnom Penh, CAMBODIA","WheatKing"
229,"2014-04-20",3.6,"Jaune pale avec une mousse moyenne blanche avec de bon retention. Larôme des céréales un peu herbeux. Le goût est du malt léger, les céréales très très fraîches, avec une finition très frais avec un léger amertume. Très rafraîchissante.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","vadie"
229,"2014-04-17",3.3,"Slightly hazy yellow with a pale head. Aroma is freshly baked bread, biscuit, grass, field flowers. Light bodied, subtly bitter on the palate with a bready background. Taste is bread, grass, citrus peel. Reasonably good Kölsch but the hops seem a little off for the style.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","GothGargoyle"
229,"2014-04-02",3.3,"Bottle, pours a clear pale yellow with a small white head. Nose brings out fresh cereal, forward grassy hops, as a really dry freshness. Flavour is similar, bringing out super fresh grassy hops, dry cereal malts, and cracker. Finishes almost lemony, with cereals and grass. A wonderful thirst-quenching hoppy kolsch.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
229,"2014-04-01",4.1,"2014-03-21 draught at the brewery16ozServed too cold. The aroma takes some time to develop, its more grassy than cereally, and it seems less delicate and more bitter than last week.2014-03-14, draught at the brewery, 
9-4-7-4-17=4116ozHazy blond color with a green and gold hue; compact head. The aroma is subtle but fantastic, with end of summer fields of cereals, breadcrust, hay; Im space traveling back to Germany. Lean, dry mouthfeel; the carbonation is slightly excessive; gentle crisp malt flavor, hint of cereals, and bold herbaceous hopping.This really captured the essence of a kolsch!","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
