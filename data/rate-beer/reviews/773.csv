773,"2016-05-28",1.7,"A few ounces of a 25.4 oz. bottle, consumed on 5-25-16. Extremely difficult to open. I had to use pliers, and even then it took a long time. Pours a murky, slightly maroonish dark brown with no head. Scents of toffee and pitted fruit (prunes). Smells pretty good. Dry, caramel flavor. Dust. Flavor is massively reduced by lack of carbonation; I think it could have been good otherwise. Utterly and completely flat. Light body and watery. A palate disaster. The lack of carbonation leaves it with not a chance of being good. My equivalent of a drain pour: I cooked with it.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
773,"2015-11-21",3.4,"Bottle. Heavy aromas of roasted, dark bread and caramel for the malt, dried flowers and cooked orange for the hops, light earth for the yeast, with notes of prune, smoke and scotch. There is no head and the color is very dark brown. Flavor starts moderately sweet and lightly acidic, then finishes lightly sweet and lightly to moderately bitter. Palate is medium to full, a bit syrupy, with no carbonation and a lightly alcoholic finish. Not a bad Dunkelweizen, wish there was a little carbonation. Not sure if its supposed to be flat or if  the cork failed.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"

773,"2013-12-14",3.3,"Bottle; Pour is dark brown / mahogany, with a very modest, fine bubbled khaki head into this glass. Some light spotting is present ; this brew has seen a bit of fade. The nose is dominant plum, spice, chocolate, sweet bread, and belgian sugar really. This brew may be classified as a dunkelweizen but I look at its more belgian than german, lets be clear. Clove like spicing near the finish is one thing but the rest of it is very Belgian by my estimation.

773,"2013-01-08",3.0,"In short: Some kind of cranked up sweetened Dunkel Weizen.  Meh.
How: Bottle 750ml corked & caged.  Consumed 3 months after purchase from a busy Albany store, no date on bottle, not sure how fresh this is.
The look: Dark brown body topped by a small beige head.
In long: Nose is overripe brown bananas, cloves-ish spiciness.  Taste is browned bananas, raisin bread, molasses, cloves, some caramel, distant chocolate, some plums.  Basically this beer tastes like a big fat dunkel weizen to which molasses was added.  Nothing offensive about this beer but Im just not a fan of those spicy sweet overripe flavors that beers like this one bring.  Or maybe it was just the wrong beer to accompany my Sushi meal, I never know what beer to choose when I eat Sushi or Filet Mignon, nobody told me life would be this hard.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

773,"2011-08-19",3.2,"Location: Draft at RnH, 8/8/11


Aroma: The nose has some caramel, molasses, toffee, wheat, and a bit of roast

Appearance: The pour is fairly dark, brownish, with a small head and minimal lace

Flavor: The taste is fairly sweet and malty, with caramel, brown sugar, and dark fruits present

Palate: This one has a medium body, it is fairly smooth and drinkable, with a slight stickiness

Overall Impression: 
This one turned out to be a solid dark wheat beer.  It is a little bit of the characteristics of a dubbel, and some of the characteristics of a dunkelweisen as well.  Solid stuff, rather high on the sweet side, but solid none-the-less.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

773,"2011-06-09",4.2,"750 ml. bottle aged 2 years. Lower carbonation due to aging but smooth on the palate. Held to light looks a very dark garnet red, at eye level looks like cola. Not much in the nose, just a little yeast and wheat. At first it almost kinda tasted like a cola finishing with some very light chocolaty roasted malt followed by a really nice yeasty finish.  It has moments of a dark german wheat or a belgian wit but this stands out and is unique. Smooth hop balance, with some of the german hops coming out, i kind of picked out a lemon drop taste with the hops, wheat and yeast. Good aged beer all around, i do not regret it at all. I found myself right at home with this one.","Raytown, Missouri, USA","freeofthoughts"
773,"2011-05-14",3.6,"750 ml. bottle. Corked and caged. Pours a medium, lasting beige head, with attractive lacing, over a clear, dark amber (SRM 13) body.....nose is light caramel/toffee, raisin, fig, plum, light molasses, cereal....taste is light sweet caramel/toffee, then light raisin, fig, plum, finishing with a hint of clove....mouth feel is medium, alcohol hidden, carbonation adds a nice foamy sensation. This is between a Dunkleweizen and a Weizenbock. It is heavier than the first and lighter than the second in both the depth and subtlety of aroma and flavor. It is a well balanced and thoroughly enjoyable beer. BJCP 8/3/14/4/7","Salida, Colorado, USA","drjay44"
773,"2011-04-01",3.4,"750 ML corked bottle. It sat in AirForceHops basement since July 2010. Deep red/ brown poor.  Bubbly white head that was short lived. Nose is raisins, plum, dark fruit with a touch of caramel in the background. A slightly light metallic smell. Taste mirrors the aroma but plum is dominating though out the sip.  A smooth almost Red wine finish, kind of dry, yet smooth. Shared with AirForceHops On a snowy April Fools Day in a winter that just doesnt want to end.  To me this is more like a Weizen Bock Rather than a Plain Jane Wheat ale. This brew has a nice layer of complexity.","New Hampshire, USA","LiteWait"

773,"2010-10-23",3.4,"750ml from Sams, Durham. Its a dubbel, Jim! Was hoping for something a bit more elaborate or quizzical from De Proef. But this dark brown beer (with amber tinges) immediately tipped its hands by sending off an aroma that recalled Westmalles yeast strain more than Proefs. Plenty of fruit in the flavor, banana and plum, but a generally indistinct malt profile tends not to give clarity to the different flavors so much as reduce them to generic Belgian.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Flavor is fairly sugary sweet but quickly followed by strong anise, rich plums, decent bitterness, finishing somewhat nutty, wow, this is actually really really good, reminds me of a fluffy trappist beer, the wheat adds wonderful character to the body allowing the strong sweet rich flavors to come through, anise and plums with a medium Belgian yeast character tying it together, the wheat adds surprising character, just a touch of tartness.  Medium bodied with a fuller mouth-feel, feels a bit sugary but ample fluffy carbonation keeps it very quaffable.  I love this.

773,"2009-11-08",3.0,"750 ml bottle from Jonathan Ron. How am I only the 2nd person on RB to rate this beer?? Well since I have seen it for as much as 10.99 a bottle and I bought it for 5.49 a bottle it could be the price or it could be that no one knows what to charge for this ""Imperial Amber Wheat"" WTH?? Well it does pour a decent looking super deep dark murky muddy brown with a large foamy light beige head. The aroma is lots of wet wheat, old wet chocolate, raisin and some plastic notes. The body is just way to fizzy on the carbonation combined with a full mouthfeel and lots of craminess, this combo just doesnt work. The flavor isnt quite as strong as the flavor but does have a wet grain and chocolate combo along with some serious spiceiness and a hint of rye and wheat that is just not complimentrary. At $10.99 I would of shot myself for buying this, at $5.49 Im happy to rate a few oucnes and drown the rest out with a good cigar.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
