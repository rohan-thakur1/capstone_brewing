Aromat: słodowy (zbożowy, tostowy, lekko karmelowy) oraz chmielowy (lekko owocowy, ziemisty, może miętowy) i nieco estrowy (jabłko, ananas, cytrusy). Do tego niewielkie nuty utlenienia oraz zbytnia, nie do końca przyjemna alkoholowość. 

Smak: słodowy (j.w.), ale raczej wytrawny niż słodki. Lekko owocowy (w granicach normy) oraz wyraźnie alkoholowy i goryczkowy. Balans zdaje się być przesunięty w kierunku chmielu 

Goryczka i odczucie w ustach: dosyć wysoka goryczka, lekko drażniąca i zalegająca. Średnia pełnia, niskie wysycenie i nieco ściągająca końcówka. Finisz wyraźnie wytrawny, ale mianem rześkiego bym go nie nazwał. Alkohol momentami rozgrzewa przełyk. 

Piwo, które zakupiłem dość przypadkowo, chcąc osiągnąć wartość zamówienia potrzebną na darmową wysyłkę. Przyznam, że nie wiązałem z nim zbyt dużych nadziei i pod tym kątem można powiedzieć, iż spełniło moje oczekiwania. Jest to piwo parowe (steam beer) znane również jako California Cammon. Do piany nie można mieć zastrzeżeń, natomiast barwę początkowo ładną psuje pod koniec zmętnienie. W aromacie również atakują nas nuty utlenia oraz nadmiernej alkohlowości, choć trzeba przyznać, że piwo jest w górnej granicy stylu. W smaku jest podobnie, zatem trudno to piwo określić jako rześkie. Ciekawszym przykładem tego stylu, jest z pewnością Anchor Steam Beer czy Flying Dog Old Scratch. O cenie tego trunku nie wspominam.","Z±bki, POLAND","tomekk1978"
