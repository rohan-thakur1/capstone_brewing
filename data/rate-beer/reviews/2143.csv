2143,"2016-10-03",3.9,"5.4%ABV. Red Rye Ale.

Poured out cloudy Amber Brown. 20ºSRM.

Nose is immediately redolent with wood smoke and wood with cherry, oak and maybe some bourbon. There is the sweetness of young wet pine. Nose is overall very sweet and agreeable.

Mouthfeel is light soap. Palate has some rounded fullness in the beginning suggesting a light sour and minerality. Palate also is reminiscent of longan and red date tea with the depth of dried longans and the light sweetness of dried red dates. There are of course charcoal, burnt tiwigs, burnt matchsticks, charred bourbon in the smoky compartment of the palate. Hops are resin, sap and richly bitter, like noble hops but without the freshness of pine or citrus. Just right for this brew which is angling for the darker, smokier end of the palate rather than the fresher, citrusy end.

Finish is medium with woodsmoke for me.

Aroma of smoked herring, juniper berries and even juniper leaves, cured bacon, toast, caramel, dried shrimp, smoldering peat and even iodine, dried cranberry, red apple peel, even some faint peach, raw beetroot, hazelnut. Crisp, refreshing onset, clean fruitiness, dried red berries, red apple and faint orange, sweetish mixed with sourish, softish carbo, smoked meat flavor immediately lending umami-like flavors and lying on top of caramelly malt sweetishness with a throughly nutty bittering edge to it; finishes in some resinous spiciness (juniper berry?), even a kind of raw vegetable-like quality, retronasal smokiness and lingering caramelly maltiness, with an earthy, gently bittering hop character added.  In view of the smoky character and its classification here, I guess this is intended as a Gotlandsdricka, a type of ancient Swedish home brew, often a rye beer, with jupiner added and allegedly having a smoky character.  Allegedly, since I have not had one so far, but it would surprise me if this one would be a truly convincing example of this all but forgotten style.

2143,"2012-06-10",3.6,"[bottle]
Bacony smoke aroma with maybe a little juniper--good balance between malt and smoke. Clear tawny gold under a bubbly, white island webbed by wisps. Woody dry flavour with dominant smoke followed by an assertive bitterness that fades to allow some malt backbone through. Faint fruity esters, but no apparent juniper. Medium body, moderate carbonation, lingering bitterness.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"
2143,"2012-04-30",3.3,"Bottle. Dark amber with decent white head. Aroma is a little strange, clear oak and smoke, some toffee and berry fruits. Taste is a slightly challenging mix of flavours, prominent oak and fair bit smoke, some tangy fruitiness. Slightly sweet and sticky with a bitter finish, doesnt clean well. Not sure this works but certainly interesting","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","BenH"
2143,"2012-04-28",4.0,"Bottle at home. Dark orange/copper colour, bubbly off-white head fades with good lacing. Nice rich, smooth smokey nose, hint of rye spice, very very light juniper berry fruitiness also (though I dont imagine I would have got those flavours if I didnt know they were already there!). Hint of light floral hops also. Nice malty rye front with a subtle fish (kippers!) smoke underneath. Fruity juniper in the finish along with some nice rich (but not overly bitter) hop accents. This is phenomenally well-made, I would never have suspected that such unrelated flavours could marry together so effectively!","SCOTLAND","dantheman278"

2143,"2012-04-13",3.4,"Fairly classic Rauchbier flavours on the nose and in the mouth. However, in terms of taste, the smoke is less oily and diminishes quickly with a nice sweet finish. Probably sacrilege but I find this more palatable and balanced than the Bamberg classics.","SCOTLAND","rjkreid"
2143,"2012-04-12",3.6,"500ml bottle, Coppers, Ncl. Herbs, woodsmoke and dried meaty aromas, which are intriguing and combine well.

Copper brown...clear...thin white head
Aroma - spicy fruits...smoky...some barbecue sausage and juniper
Taste - Odd peppery fruity, smoky barbecue (not as much as a rauschbier), sweet caramel malt, woody smoke. background of bitter hops...Its a well made beer....I tried to like it and had 2 attempts on the same night...but I didnt
Palate - soft carb...thin to medium body...smooth...smoky aromatic palate. Finish dry smoky aromatic very longing.
Overall - I know its a well made beer...Interesting and unusual...but I  simply didnt like the taste....perhaps dont like junipers....I think this beer is meant to divide opinion","Near Carrick-on-Shannon, IRELAND","stravale"
2143,"2012-03-23",3.7,"[cask at 27th HWFest, Riccarton] Amberish bronze beer with a pretty hefty head. Aromas mostly of smoke, with that juniper edge it did remind me of cured fish. Tastewise it was lovely - how Tempest get such a balance of flavour with ingredients such as that is beyond me. Touch of berry fruit at first on the taste, before the smoke arrived  but not to huge Bamburg level, it was pitched just right  before the finish flicked into sloe gin-esque juniper dryness. Didnt get a whole lot of rye, but the flavour was spot on   another winner [22032012]","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","BeerCast_Rich"
