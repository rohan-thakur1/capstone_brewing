It has a modest and nicely balanced aroma. I get some dark malty sweetness with hints of caramel, milk chocolate and dark cocoa powder. Also there is a hint of earthy/leafy hops in the background. The flavor starts by matching nose with notes of caramel, creamy milk chocolate as well as darker and dryer cocoa powder that seems to add a touch of bitterness. The hops add a touch of mild bitterness them selves but only just enough to keep things from becoming too sweet. The plate is smooth and silky with soft carbonation.

4167,"2014-05-18",3.5,"Transferred from BA review on 2-3-12 -
Had on tap served in a pint glass

Appearance  Poured a nearly pure black that let little to no light through when held up. There was a slightly off white head that was present upon serving which gave way rather quickly leaving almost no lacing.

Smell  Chocolate is heavy on the nose mixed with a slight bit of roasty coffee aroma. Some vanilla works it way in toward the end rounding out the aroma quite nicely.

Taste  Quite a bit of roasted maltiness starts the taste profile. Sweet chocolate then shows up and takes over the show though. The light vanilla that is present at the end of the smell is also present throughout the taste; its subtle but it ties together the transitions between the roasty maltiness and sweet chocolate quite well.

Mouthfeel  Fairly creamy with a moderate level of carbonation. It is very fitting for the style, but nothing all that exceptional.

Overall  When you are in the mode for something with a nice smooth sweet chocolate taste this one delivers quite well.","","Darkmagus82"

Very sweet like most bocks. Tastes like an over-malted porter. Strong alcohol oiliness. Up front, the chocolate predominates, but soon raisin and brandy flavors come through. A notable hop bitterness becomes present in the swallow. The aftertaste is nearly all sweet malt and alcohol warmth.

I think price is an important consideration here. My bottle was $16 for just under 24oz. This is a good beer, but not a spectacular one. Taste someone elses and purchase something equally creative at half the price.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","smcolw"
4167,"2014-01-28",3.1,"pours a very dark brown with a bubble tan head. Head disappears VERY fast!; like the head on a soda rather than a beer. 

Unlike other chocolate beers Ive had, the cocoa in this one is not subtle. There are some flavor components in cocoa nibs (the chocolate source for this beer) that I am not real fond of, but I think it is just the particular mix of hops, roasted malt and cocoa that doesnt work for me. The objectionable aspects of the taste appear in the finish and aftertaste. In addition, I found this to be too sweet. 

O: I like chocolate and beer, and I am a big fan of Sam Adams, so this beer was a disappointment.

4167,"2013-11-08",3.5,"January 23rd, 2012 - Sam Adams Chocolate Bock is one of the most promising bottles to come out of the box of seasonal varietals being pushed on customers at Costco this season. The bottles label os understated, but when you read the words, youll begin pre-salivating for that imagined chocolate and beer blend. But before that, the aroma is a curious mix of well worn leather, cooked beef and a touch of sweet cocoa, like a dried hot cocoa mix. The official description for Sam Adams Chocolate Bock lists a whole congregation of flavors and opposing tastes, but my bedraggled taste buds catch a much simpler collection of chocolate shavings and chocolate milk. Though the flavors are dark, sweet and bitter, the palate is thick and quenching, making the Chocolate Bock strangely filling, almost akin to chocolate milk. I dont know that this is the most elegant expression of a chocolate based beer, but its certainly a welcome highlight to the Sam Adams boxed seasonal beers.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Aroma / Appearance - The brownish black base and wispy head resemble dusty clouds soaking up the pollution of a coal chimney. Chocolate pudding, malt, and black tea are very sweet. If it were toned down a notch this was get a few more key points.

Flavor / Palate - Chocolate pudding is thick and chewy on the tongue. Creaminess in the body needs to be dialed back or it needs more depth.

4167,"2012-12-09",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 11, 2013 While I like this latest example, it is not the original and the differences are obvious in both aroma and taste. The original had  depth lacking in the current product. It also sold for $15 for a 25 oz. bottle. So, the RateBeer description is no longer accurate (see below). So-called craft brewers need to be straightforward about what they are doing. I would conjecture that most of us understand that  ""craft"" brewers have brought back honesty in brewing. This is particularly true of Sam Adams with its incessant emphasis on the German Purity Law.

Heres the present description of the Chocolate Bock. Compare it to the above and you will see significant differences.

Smooth, rich, and dark, with the robust flavor and creamy texture of chocolate.

To create Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock, we wanted to take the flavor beyond the taste of dark roasted malt. For this years brew we worked with a blend of cocoa nibs including Ecuador nibs from TCHO®, an artisanl chocolate maker in San Francisco. We started with a hand selected Noble hops from Bavaria and combined that with a complex selection of carefully roasted malts. This dark beer has a big, malty character with the added sweetness of chocolate. We slowly age the beer on a bed of rare dark cocoa nibs, the primary ingredient in chocolate. Known for their quality, these cocoa nibs harvested in Ecuador, impart complex aromas and flavors from chocolaty to fruity, nutty, earthy, and citrusy.

It has far less body and far less chocolate and malt character. The current is one of six in the ""Winter Classics"" 12 pack. Boston Beer has done this before with Light and Summer Ale. With the latter, they stated they had changed the formula but not now. Sad for the supposedly ""premier"" craft brewer. That said, I do like this iteration. Merry Christmas!","Massachusetts, USA","damzz"

It was more complex than anticipated, which is a good thing. Otherwise, I might have felt as if I was drinking Hershey syrup.

The nose is light with notes of cocoa powder and bittersweet chocolate.  The flavor has a chocolate, cherry, and cola thing going on but gives way very quickly.  A little on the sweet side with a medium to full body.  Average carbonation gives way to a short to medium, sweet finish.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

The mouth is the weakest aspect of this beer. Thin and slick going down. Carbonation level is short and tame. This is definitely a chocolate beer first and foremost. Lots of creamy milk chocolate, cocoa, some sweet vanilla, and more chocolate. There isnt a bitter presence at all. This is for sure a dessert beer. It was pleasant to drink, but Id need to be in the mood for something like this.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

4167,"2012-04-15",3.8,"Pours a fairly opaque dark brown, with a thin, light tan head.  The head disappears rather quickly and only a trace amount of lacing remains.  Aroma of, yes, chocolate--but more of a sweet milk chocolate than cocoa.  The smell of highly processed candy is also dominant--for some reason, red licorice (Strawberry Twizzlers).  While typical beer aromas are not there, the taste is more in line with a lager--albeit a highly flavored one.  Sweetness of milk chocolate is matched almost equally by the sweetness of toasted malts.  No hop bitterness evident at all--this ones sweet all the way.  There may be a mild butter toffee flavor in the background.  Alcohol can also be detected.  Mouthfeel is watery with just a trace of carbonation, which is right in line with this style.  In sum:  Ive tried this beer just about every year since it began.  Despite the various changes that Samuel Adams has made to ingredients and bottling, its flavor has remained almost the same.  Because there are few chocolate lagers to begin with, this beer stands out.  But its ability to truly convey a milk chocolate flavor makes it a winner.  If you love dessert beers, this ones a MUST.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","elektrikjester"

4167,"2012-02-02",3.5,"12 oz bottle from the Fall sampler pack. This one pours a mostly clear, dark reddish brown color and topped by a small head of tan colored foam that recedes quickly to a thin film. The aroma shows notes of melted dark chocolate, dark fruits, and a touch of vanilla all atop a malt base of toasted caramel. There is some earthen hop bitterness in the back that tries to break up the sweetness. The flavor follows suit with the milk and dark chocolate and caramel shining through while dry dark fruits, vanilla, and peppery spice add nice depth and keep things from getting too sweet. Medium bodied and creamy on the palate with balanced carbonation that leads to a lengthy, rich cocoa finish. The palate is a little lacking, but this is still a tasty enough brew. I just couldnt drink too many as it is more like a dessert. Glad they put this into the 12oz sampler packs as opposed to the expensive 500ml bottle.

4167,"2011-12-18",4.2,"WOW.  This Beer is the finest chocolate flavored beer I have ever had.
I got it as part of the seasonal 12 pack.
The aroma is underwhelming mostly inorganic metallic chemicals.
The taste is amazing though: full of lactic sours with a robust chocolate flavor that hits late.  The beer malt slips seamlessly through the chocolate flavor while a slight tinge of bitter reminds us were not drinking  a yohoo.

The texture is the most atypical of all chocolates.  It leaves your mouth with a tart cleaness whereas most chocolate beers are nearly syrup.","Seattle, Alabama, USA","nealblind"

More chocolate in the flavor along with some caramel, vanilla and maybe just a hint of coffee. Overall rather sweet, but not from the chocolate. The chocoloate flavor seems more like a tame dark chocolate - not bitter but not real sweet either. The sweetness seems to come more from the caramel and vanilla flavors. Not bad, but probably a bit too sweet for me.","North Dakota, USA","kjohns"

The finish is long, medium sweet and roasty, with chocolate notes. On the palate, it is medium-full in body with a smooth, milky texture and soft carbonation.

Very slight oilyness in the finish causes the cocoa to linger nicely on the tongue.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","BillWyce"

4167,"2011-09-05",2.2,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Pint glass.

Appearance: Dark brown with a slight reddish cast. Fizzy head at first that quickly disappears, leaving nothing behind. Looks like flat Coke.

Aroma: Chocolate, caramel, cherry and light noble hops.

Taste: Mostly sweet chocolate upfront, with a malt base of cherry, caramel and a very slight roastiness. The cherry caries through to the end, and the noble hops make an appearance as well. Something about the cherry/noble hop finish does not gel with the chocolate. Actually starts to really bother me.

Feel: Moderately low carbonation, somewhat creamy but a tinge thin. Barely dry finish.

Overall: While interesting, it just doesnt mesh as well as I had hoped. The lackluster appearance certainly does not help my generosity when reviewing. I actually find it hard to finish.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

Pours a dark black color with a nice amount of dark tan head. Dissipates slightly quickly but leaves awesome lacing. 

Aroma is very malty. Caramel, chocolate and coffee. Also a very strong alcohol scent. Smells more and more like chocolate as it warms. Seems to get sweeter too. Like a cool glass of nesquick. 

Taste starts out medium sweet but ends medium bitter. Its like bitter dark chocolate and coffee. Very good!

Medium bodied with a somewhat thin texture. Fizzy carbonation and a slightly long, somewhat bitter finish. 

Overall, its pretty darn good. Definitely something I would like to have again, but I would like to try a fresh one. I think the only problem I would have is paying 15 bucks for a 750.

Bought a SA 12 pack variety pack for the recent Thanksgiving holiday for the non craft drinkers and this was left over.
Pours a clear deep dark brown with faint ruby highlight on the edges. Minuscule tan head disappears almost immediately but leaves a ring around the top of the beer. Smells like a full glass of Hersheys chocolate syrup mixed with a faint hint of wet dog. Taste is malty sweet with again lots of chocolate syrup. Slight bit of dark fruit and a hint of minerals in the taste as well. Sweet chocolate chewy mouthfeel, oily mouthfeel and a moderate level of carbonation. I remember not being to fond of this when I overpaid for a bigger bottle, this reasonably priced bottle doesnt make it much better. Its really kind of one dimensional, I get lots of chocolate and little else.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"

It is chocolatey indeed, perhaps too chocolatey for me, and too sweet, with some detectable vanilla there as well. It just lacks character and bitter. The alcohol is barely noticeable at all. This is not to say I disliked it--I just had very high expectations. I am well aware of its qualities, so Im willing to give it a third try at some point in the future.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

Wonderful brew, I wish the Boston Beer Company made more of it.

Nice chocolate blending with malt on the nose.  Malt comes through at the end of the aroma.  The mouthfeel is thick, and the taste has an initial burst of chocolate.  Finishes with the malt more forward (like the nose) but has a very short finish.  The chocolate has a bittersweet taste to it in mid-palate.

4167,"2011-03-10",3.8,"A - Pours a dark black color with just a hint of brown, and a nice finger of chocolate colored head. The head fairly quickly reduced to a ring and leaves behind little lacing.

S - Full of chocolate and sweet roasted malts. Very nice carmel and roasted aroma.

T - Starts off with a mix of sweet malts and light chocolate flavor. Eventually the chocolate really builds up and a bit of a burnt taste. These flavors really mix and balance well. This finish is full of chocolate flavor that lasts for a while afterwards.

M - Medium-light bodied with light carbonation. Just a touch creamy through the middle and a nice dry finish gives it some crispness.

D - Overall fairly drinkable. The chocolate flavor is nice and just maybe a tad overpowering, but I enjoyed it. Otherwise, the only thing missing was maybe a little malt.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"

Poured nice and dark black, the head was fizzy instead of foamy. thinking it might be a bit thin.

smells heavily of chocolate, cant really find much else in here, a little touch of malt profile

Tastes like hersheys chocolate syrup squeezed into some water. its not thick enough to be milk. barely anything in this other than the chocolate, and its not a great chocolate taste either.

mouthfeel is thin and fizzy, not at all what i want in a chocolate bock. 

its easy enough to drink i suppose, light and watery. doesnt need to wait till dessert. drink it with a burger and fries instead of getting a chocolate coke.","Bloomington, Minnesota, USA","SourNotes"
4167,"2011-02-21",3.2,"Pours dark brown with a reddish hue and has a patchy tan head.  The aroma has a decent amount of cocoa, vanilla and lager smoothness, mild alcohol, milk duds and something I can only think of as household cleaner.  Medium thin body with mild sharp carbonation.  The flavor starts with semi-fake chocolate flavor, mild spice, vanilla and a hint of oak.  The finish has lager smoothness and some slickness.  Okay beer, but not really my thing.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
4167,"2011-02-21",3.6,"Pours with an opaque chocolate brown color that is much like that of a good stout. The aroma almost explodes out of the bottle from the second the cap is removed with the unmistakable scent of bittersweet chocolate. The flavor is likewise dense with chocolate, with a rich chocolate cake characteristic up front. This chocolate bomb wears on the palate after a while, though, and an earthy bitterness that doesnt entirely mesh with the chocolate notes creeps in. The texture is smooth, creamy, but also quite clean, creating a strange and interesting contrast to the rich flavor. Overall, this may be the most chocolate-flavored beer Ive had, but the novelty wears off after a while, and whats left isnt particularly robust. Definitely interesting, though, and worth the try.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","devilben02"

4167,"2011-01-31",4.3,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Information on the label lists the ABV at 5.8% and includes a freshness date. (""Enjoy Before Month Notched"" Apr.)

Appearance: It pours out of the bottle a dark reddish/brown color and appears very dark in the glass with some deep crimson highlights. Its head is tall, thick and tan in color. As I drink, it fades to a thin foamy layer with a ring of sticky foam at the edge of the glass. This makes lots of slick lacing on the glass with a few spots clinging to the glass.

Smell: It has a modest and nicely balanced aroma. I get some dark malty sweetness with hints of caramel, milk chocolate and dark cocoa powder. Also there is a hint of earthy/leafy hops in the background.

Taste/Palate: The flavor starts by matching nose with notes of caramel, creamy milk chocolate as well as darker and dryer cocoa powder that seems to add a touch of bitterness. The hops add a touch of mild bitterness them selves but only just enough to keep things from becoming too sweet. The plate is smooth and silky with soft carbonation. Its not too heavy or sticky at all and slides down easily, finishing fairly quick and nicely balanced.

Notes: This is an outstanding beer and a highlight of the 2010 winter mixed 12 pack.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

4167,"2011-01-03",3.3,"Poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Appearance: Pours very dark brown to black with hints of ruby red when held up to the light. There is a minimal brown head that fades quickly but maintains a nice ring on top of the beer. Aroma: chocolate dominates the nose with a sweetness from the malt that makes it more like milk chocolate. Taste: similar to the aroma, the taste is mostly bittersweet to milk chocolate. Not much malt sweetness except maybe to cut the bitterness of the chocolate and to provide a solid background. Overall: The beer is lacking the characteristic malt sweetness I would have expected from a bock beer. Nevertheless, the chocolate flavor is nice and the mouthfeel is pleasant. The beer is good overall, just not a bock in my opinion.","Pennsylvania, USA","Breinstein"

A - Very deep, dark cherry oak color with a very large, creamy, thick, foamy, sticky, toasted marshmallow colored head. Amazing retention finally settling into a nice foamy lace.

S - At first it was a little faint, but 1 minute later, the aroma really gained a nice kick. Full of milk chocolate and cocoa nibs. Slight burnt and bitterness along with just the faintest earthy aroma. Some burnt caramel as well. I think Im getting the slightest tart (dark fruit?) aroma at the end. Chocolate is dominant though, and it smells delicious cant wait to try it.

T - Taste is similar. Loads of chocolate (milk and some bittersweet) and cocoa nibs. Slightly burnt malt and caramel along with some nutty flavors as well as some earthiness. Faint hint of vanilla. Sweet with just a touch of a burnt bitterness. A bit of a Ovaltine type of taste.

M - Light body with plenty of carbonation. A little thin, but not bad for the style, but pretty smooth.

D - Goes down extremely easy and is quite enjoyable. Loads of chocolate and slightly sweet but has some off-setting bitterness as well.

4167,"2010-04-04",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 30, 2012 I like to think of myself as something of a formalist critic, meaning that whatever I review, I judge it against itself. However, there are certain times when you cant help but judge something based on external factors. Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock is a good example of what I mean. Since this is a rare, expensive seasonal beer I found it very underwhelming. Had it been a more standard craft beer I might have given it a higher grade. But when you pay $17 for one bottle of beer you have an expectation and this just didnt live up to it, hence the average rating.POUR, COLOR AND AROMASamuel Adams Chocolate Bock is bottled in 25oz bottles, resembling a bottle of wine. It pours quite rough at first but eventually smoothens out. It forms a small, tan, soapy head which doesnt linger for very long. The appearance is seemingly opaque black, but is actually dark ruby red.There isnt much of an aroma to speak of; just a dry scent reminiscent of most bocks or black lagers.TASTEI didnt know what to expect with Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock. Id recently tried another chocolate beer and was underwhelmed. Surely a $17 bottle of chocolate beer that contains imported ingredients from Europe and Africa MUST be rich and tasty, right?Well, not exactly. This brew tastes like a generic bock with just a hint of dry chocolate flavor in the aftertaste. Much like other bocks Ive tried, I found the flavor to be slightly sweet but without the nasty cough syrup quality of most bocks. This tastes more like a black lager and has almost a cola-like taste. But where is the chocolate? The description on www.samueladams.com reads like pure hyperbole compared to the actual taste of this beer which is rather bland. Not that it tastes bad, not in the least, but for $17 I want a much tastier beer.FINISHAt least this beer is very easy to drink. It doesnt have any harsh, spicy qualities to its palate and does have just the sweetest finish so it goes down extremely smooth. I have a feeling this clean finish was specifically engineered since this beer is likely meant to appeal to anyone who likes chocolate, not just craft beer drinkers. Even the lightest lightweight will have no trouble downing this brew. But considering the price, this isnt a beer youd want to slam anyway, so feel free to savor it.BODYI was able to drink an entire 25oz bottle in about 30 minutes without feeling overwhelmed in the least. Unique beers like this have a reputation for being extreme, but at only 5.5% ABV Sam Adams Chocolate Bock is weaker than some mass market beers. It should be noted that it does contains 230 calories per 12oz serving  ay, theres the rub. You might want to opt for it instead of cake or ice cream for dessert.FINAL THOUGHTSThis is one of those beers that stumps me because I cannot think of anything negative to say about it, yet I cant enthusiastically endorse it, either. It would work well as a Christmas or Valentines treat as it could be easily enjoyed by the non-connoisseur and by men and women equally. Just dont expect this beer to be the liquid, alcoholic equivalent of a Godiva bar.NOTE: watch the video version of this review at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9eJ459l-D0","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

I guess with a name like Chocolate bock I shouldnt be surprised.  Im looking for other flavors but this just lingers too long to find any.  Perhaps as it warms itll mellow?

4167,"2010-01-03",3.9,"Every three years Samuel Adams releases their renowned Chocolate Bock. Seeing as I am still relatively new to the beer scene, while I may have been around and supping on brews when the last batch of Chocolate Bock was released, I sure as heck didnt know about it. That all has changed though and I try to stay much more on top of beer releases and the beer scene in general. I was hoping to age a Chocolate Bock to see how it faired, but she is a light bock and is best-buy dated, a fact many Samuel Adams appreciators may not be aware of. Fear not though, if you havent cracked yours open yet, do so, and you will not be disappointed.


Deep blacks and browns flow like silken threads into my glass, settling underneath a velveteen khaki head which slowly recedes into an attractive ring. Her depths may be dark, but holding my glass up to the light, she is crystal clear, burnt amber and garnet highlights streaking where the light pierces the deepest. As I poured my Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock into my glass, faint esters of her nose teased mine. Hesitation is not my middle name, and with shameless abandon I dip my nose deep into her sultry depths. Rich Belgian chocolates permeate her nose and seduce my senses. Nothing but the finest here, and I know a chocolatier somewhere is blushing in humble pride. As her chocolates continue to melt and seduce, gentle esters of licorice, prunes, cherry cordials, toffee and caramel mingle and dance together in supple harmony. She exudes balance along with her promise of sultry riches. Someone must have taken the fudge cake out of the oven because here comes rich warm melted chocolates, take two. Mingling with the chocolate this time is vanilla bean, cinnamon sugar cookies cooked to a brilliant golden brown, graham crackers and a kiss of honey. Whew. And I havent even delved into her inviting depths, but all that is about to changerightnow. Smooth and mouthcoating, her softness rivals the finest silks. Chocolate rolls across my tongue with velvety finesse. As promised, her proud Belgian heritage permeates her palate in perfect precision and balance. Each quaff melts and mingles and melds into a menagerie of flavors that are nothing short of liquid harmony. Caramel and cherry cordials mingle atop chocolate cake slathered in all-natural chocolate fudge icing. There is a playful nip of tart unripe cherries in the swallow while dark fruits, prunes, and raisins add some meat to her body. Long after each quaff chocolate continues to whisper sweet nothings in my ear. Weak knead and near my point of no return, I sup reverently on her slowly diminishing bounty as vanilla bean and licorice finish with a shiver. As a bock and not a double bock, there is little to no discernable heat, just pleasant chocolate warmth that promises rosy cheeks and sensual abandon. Exquisite.


The only shameful side of the Samuel Adams Chocolate Bock, 2009, is that now I have to wait three more years for the next release. Samuel Adams rarely ever disappoints, and with this particular beauty, inhibitions were tossed, humility shunned, and every indulgence indulged. Chocolate bars? Paf!

4167,"2009-11-21",3.4,"Year old Magnum size bottle.  Props for the impressive kings imperial court style bottle with the ""metal"" logo. Has a deep roasted chestnut color, bordering on black with a thin tan head.  Aroma is nothing but sweet chocolate that strays close to straight cocoa powder. For the most part the taste is dominated by chocolate with no hops and a touch of malt to prop it up.  Decidedly thin on the palate with a noticeable fizzy carbonation.  Lacks the complexity of other chocolate flavored beers, but showcases a Hersheys style milk chocolate better than any beer Ive ever had. I swear 4th graders who had never tried beer would kill each other for this stuff. Overall Id call it unique, because it really is ""chocolately"", but lacks the depth and richness of other chocolate oriented beers. I actually think the bock style used to showcase the chocolate works great except for the fact that the relatively thin lager body is a little too watery to support a strong chocolate or cocoa flavor.  Maybe a little too much ""hot cocoa by the campfire"" for my taste. May get you laid by chicks that arent really into beer but love chocolate.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"
4167,"2009-11-19",2.4,"An underwhelming chocolatey sweet bock with a thin, watery feel. Its not a bad looking beer. They get points for the awesome metal sticker bottle, alone. The beer is very dark and the head comes up nicely if with somewhat less staying power and stickiness than hoped for. The smell is sweet and too thin but very chocolatey. The chocolate is just not complex enough to garner a higher score. The same problems exist on the palette, but theyre even more pronounced. It tastes more like cocoa than chocolate. Its just not really my thing, but I can understand how someone could enjoy it. The feel is thin, a bit watery and works against the chocolate. It just tastes more like cocoa water than anything else. It just really lacks complexity. Im fairly shocked that Boston Beer is selling this beer for so much money. Its a great bottle, but there are better chocolate beers for a third of the price. I know its a bock and maybe some folks like that, but its nature as a bock takes a big backseat with this beer.

Picking up some chocolate roasted malts. Damn not much going on. Some floral hops hide behind the malts. Flavor starts a lot better than aroma, big chocolate and sweet cocoa malitiness. The chocolate continues to the finish but becomes even sweeter, hershey chocolate type of sweetness with just a bit of coffee. Rich cocoa finish. Medium to full body that is creamy and smooth. Its hard to hate or to love this beer, aroma is bleck, flavor is alright, palate is very nice.

4167,"2009-08-19",3.5,"Very expensive bottle shared with funkybrewster, best by april 2009, or so it says.  Pours a gorgeous shinny obsidian with a medium thick creamy tan froth 4.5.  Aroma is pure cola, probably aided by oxidation, very grassy, touch of soy.  Taste  brings my memory distinctly back to Frederick Millers Classic Chocolate whatever it was... except not nearly as good and the SA has some soy and grass mixed in, super rich caramel underneath it all.  Flavor is mainly chocolate syrup, very rich, slightly sourish.  A mix of dark and milk chocolates, malty, somewhat fruity.  Medium bodied, full mouthful with a lighter feeling though, confused? me too, milky with soft abundant fluffy sizzling carbonation.  Frederick Millers Classic Chocolate Lager kicks the crap out of this and was about 1/10th the price.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

In spite of the fact that this is fruit and chocolate, its mouthfeel is still pretty thin and the flavors are not syrupy.  Im not sure what I was expecting to find here, but this is much less chocolaty than I would have guessed.  There is a bit of ephemeral tartness that comes and goes, but it keeps things interesting.

The aroma is vinous and malty with notes of dark malts, caramel, dark fruit, and a light earthiness - not much chocolate in the nose. The flavor, on the hand, is satisfying with chocolate. It starts with a slight graininess and thick, chewy caramel malt wave. There are touches of dark fruit towards mid-palate and a big, subtle-at-first, distinct layer of cocoa. The finish has a distinct semi-sweet chocolate character to it. It finishes full with some malt sweetness, some caramel, a subtle earthiness, and a very light dark fruit character. The mouthfeel is well carbonated, adding a light touch of spritziness to an otherwise full-bodied texture. Overall, a very drinkable and flavorful beer.

After checking the nose on this one (literally 9-10 times), I had to conclude that it did indeed contain predominant chocolates (there are so many ""chocolate"" brews that miss the mark totally).  The flavors are interesting... some underlying dark chocolate notes, a staunch oaked vanilla middle and ripened dark cherries overtop, with trace notes of peanuts and blueberries (ripened sweet, not aged early and sour).  The finish is interesting... a souring take on the malt contingencies.  The mouthfeel is definitively creamy with semi-zesty carbonation levels, accompanied by a lightly-medium embodiment.

4167,"2009-02-27",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2016 This is amazing!!  ive had a wide range of chocolate beers but none as delicate as this one. strong cocoa flavor while still being subtle. how the hell did they do that? one of my favorite beers...i try to get it every holiday season. update 12/26/08-had another one for the first time in a while. BEST FINISH EVER!! Smooth as silk, I cant think of how to improve it. Id give the aftertaste an 11/10 if I could. 
Hasnt quite been the same in 12 oz bottles, but still a lovely seasonal.  Had the 750s in the 4,7-4.8 range...about a 4.3 on the last few years in the mix pack.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
4167,"2009-02-27",3.6,"750ml bottle. Pours a fairly dark brown with a medium lasting head. Aroma is definitely malty and caramelly. Flavor is nicely malty, though not a whole lot of the chocolate thats supposed to be there. Finish is pleasantly dry, with a little chocolate aftertaste. Good mouthfeel. A well-made beer by Sam Adams, though Id prefer not to pay $17 for it.","Houston, Texas, USA","jumpjet2k"
4167,"2009-02-22",3.7,"Pours a translucent chestnut with a fluffy, ecru head and sticky, wispy lace. The nose is of sweet, bready (Munich?) malt, cocoa, light caramel and a faint nuttiness. Medium-bodied with a slick, almost flat, mouthfeel and a mildly astringent finish. Fairly complex for a beer weighing in at 5.5% ABV: a blend of Munich malt and cocoa, fruity and light while still substantial on the tongue. The only detractor is the finish which is a bit drying and astringent possessing a slightly medicinal aftertaste. Overall, this is a solid beer and one of the better of this style that I have sampled. While the bottle is fairly ""cool"" looking, the $15 price tag will likely deter me from picking up another bottle any time soon.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"
4167,"2009-02-22",4.1,"750 ml bottle.  Pours very dark brown with a moderate tan head that faded to a ring after about a third of the glass and left nice lace all the way to the end.  Very pleasant aroma of cocoa and malt along with perhaps a few notes of vanilla.  The flavor is equally nice with abundant chocolate along with malt and just a bit of caramel.  Very silky, smooth mouthfeel with virtually no bitterness to speak of.  I like that this beer is a bit light bodied; if it were heavy it would be too sweet and cloying.  This is not something I would drink every day, but as a dessert beer, it is excellent.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"

I was a little disappointed in the palate, a little on the thin side. Flavor is very chocolatey. Probably the best chocolate taste of all the beers Ive had that claimed to have chocolate in them.

4167,"2009-02-07",3.6,"THOUGHTS: I had this a couple of years ago for Easter and wasnt impressed, but that was before I was rating and knew as much as I do now about how to drink a beer properly. So I decided to see how it went now. It was like a more chocolaty, less bitter Penn St. Nikolaus Bock.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, dark red that was nearly black, but when put to a light it glowed garnet red. It also had a small to average, tan head that mostly diminished and left fair lacing. The aroma was moderate to heavy grain, cereal, cocoa and roasted malts, slight vanilla and a slight alcohol that was odd for something this low of an ABV. The initial flavor was sweet and slightly sour, while the finish was a little sour, a little bitter and sweet with an average duration. There was cocoa, roasted malt, grain, chocolate syrup, slight coffee and slight hops, and even slight vanilla. The medium body, which would probably feel full if not for all the carbonation, was sort of creamy, but also oily and seemed to get thinner and thiner and flatter and flatter as time passed. It started out extremely fizzy to the point of being tingly on the lips with a light astringent and slightly chalky finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

Plenty of chocolate and roasty malt in the aroma, a little bit of chalk, but very forgivable. The taste is on eof the most under control and delicious chocolate beers that I have ever tasted, yes the chocolate is there, no this does not appear to be artificially sweetened at all. The chocolate is so nice and plays particularly well with the malt sweetness. There is not a lot of dryness happening here nor is there much bitterness, most of the bitterness present uses the bitterness of the coco to express itself wonderfully. I could only drin k this on occassion and with a price tag like that I am sure it will only be on rare occasions.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
4167,"2009-01-05",3.5,"Dark, but clear body with a quickly diminishing head.  Malty aromas with a slight hint of chocolate.  Good aroma, but it is not that strong.  Excellent nose, with a chocolate sweetness followed by a clean tasting malt profile.  The finish is pretty bland as the beer has little stickiness, which is also noticeable by a lackluster lacing on the glass.  Also, the carbonation is a bit high as the acidic tone is present in the aftertaste.  This is a pretty good beer, but there are better chocolate beers out there.  They need to work on the finish and amp up the aroma a bit; this beer just doesnt have a strong enough character to warrant being this highly rated.  Im guessing its because people dont want to rate a $13 beer too low, or they will look stupid for buying it in the first place.  Interestingly enough, I bought this bottle in an Albertson’s in Louisiana, so the note at the end of the description is obviously wrong.","Houston, Texas, USA","RaginCajun"

Creamy, light brown, finger-width head that dissipates quickly and remains pretty heavily laced and swirly. Aroma is malty and sweet. Lots of smooth cherry aroma, some milk chocolate, honey, and vanilla bean. No real roast, bitterness, or hop backing. Taste is very similar. Medium sweetness and cherry maltiness initially, light chocolate middle, and a very small amount of finishing roast. There is a good amount of smooth chocolate in the finish though, which is nice. Some caramel and nuttiness too. The palate is very creamy and velvety. Its a little weird though...its very full and thick initially, but finishes very light. Very delicate and soft.

After that there is baking cocoa, a nice amount of sweet caramel, a little syrupy vanilla, chocolate covered almonds and cashews.

The finish also leaves only the slightest hop signature on the palate.  Not bad at all.  The bock is among my favorite styles, and this beer scores decently in this category.

The inky liquid is topped with a thick, foamy, beige colored head that shows nice retention.  Jagged flares of lacing give way to some intricate, sticky webbing.  While it looks pretty enough, the aroma is a bit underwhelming.  Light cocoa powder notes are dulled with overbearing lactose, while burnt caramel, dried dark fruits, and earthy hop spice seem to fall into the background.  Flavors show mostly the same elements, but are more clearly delineated and harmonious.  Cocoa and caramel shine, while warm, peppery hop spice and dry dark fruits follow along for the ride.  A creamy, balanced palate is nice, but not quite substantial enough to be outstanding.

The bottle says drink before 2006, but its still a nice drink.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"

Carbonation is good with a tight thin head.  Taste is smooth, gently sweet and mildly toasted.  It starts with a medium body that has a smooth mouth feel and goes down with a subtle sweetness.  The finish comes on with a bubbly feel, the sweetness turns to a mild toasted flavor with a very faint bitterness and ends with back tones of chocolate.  I think the chocolate becomes more distinct as you drink a little more of it.  I think it hits just what they say it will be on the neck card.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","RSRIZZO"

Aroma of sweet milk chocolate, sweet grapes, roasted barley malt, honey caramel and some herbs. Taste is smooth, chocolatey, full body, raisin sweetness, and a mild bitter finish.

But...

The first sip is more of that same sweet chocolate, followed by more sweet chocolate, finishing with more sweet chocolate. The chocolate flavor itself is quite sugary. While artificial might not be the right word to describe the flavor, it would not take much to convince me that it is the right word. Lets be nice and call it an inexpensive chocolate - more like Nestles Quik than Godiva. By the third sip, I have had enough of this chocolate. 

OK, so the chocolates not for me. How about the rest of the beer? Malt? Hop presence? Anything? Nope. Just chocolate and carbonation. A medium-bodied chocolate soda for adults.

Lots of cocoa coming through, and its not trying to be light in the slightest. Only pales in comparison to the Chocolate Stout from Rogue. Rather thin, but that cocoa flavor is very nice. This is like drinking a light dessert. This would go exceptionally well with chocolate cake. Its very light, texture-wise, but this carries a wonderful chocolate flavor.

4167,"2006-04-14",3.8,"Aroma: Strong chocolate with berry undertones
Appearance: Deep opaque not quite black with a beautiful dark red shine which was especially visible on the outside edge of the fluid.  Head was extremely disappointing though as it was light brown in color but disippated extremely quickly although significant carbonation remained
Flavor: Dark chocolate malt on top with a dark berry, cherry, and vanilla undertone
Palate: Earthy roasted malts
Overall: This beer was very interesting as it was definitely about the chocolate.  This made it very filling and hence you could sample from very cold to room temperature prior to finishing it.  The dark malty flavor became stronger as it warmed and as the carbonation lessened while the berry and vanilla flavors lessened over time.  The scent of this beer is unique and enjoyable.  I was extremely disappointed with the head of this beer for the price yet the red at the edges was remarkable.  The bottle is also very special looking with the tin front label.

From Bottle

Poured dark with reddish tones. Huge off-white, creamy head. Aroma of malts and chocolate as soon as I popped the cap. Flavor was bready, and sweet. Slight chcoclate hints. As it warmed more chocolate notes are present, and seem to take over, and the bready and malty tones mellow down a bit. Rich, smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Medium body. Not as complex as I would have expected. it is good, not for the pricetag though. However, I do like it, and im glad I got to drink this.","Pennsylvania, USA","SB"
4167,"2006-01-08",3.7,"Bottle from  December 2004, ""Enjoy before March 2005."" I decided to keep this for a year to see how it did. Refrigerated with no light for the whole time. Deep clear mahogany and a somewhat small but creamy head that settled in just a couple of minutes.  Chocolate definitely dominates the aroma, but there are some underlying dark fruity, almost vinous notes.  Rich, smooth mouthfeel, medium body with very little  carbonation.  Dark roasted malt, brown sugar, and of course chocolate are the primary flavors, but there is a hint of fruiitiness. Finish is sweet, a bit syrupy with little hop presence. A bit on hte sweet side, but enjoyable nonetheless.  Seems to have aged pretty well, especially for a lager.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"

My conclusion was simply that this was a good beer for a mass produced chocolate bock.  Far from my favorite, it came across more blandly than others I have tried.  The head was incredibly frothy - to the point a friend attempted to show me ""how its done"".  Some pour he got as well, tall head, and a look of amazement.  Flavor was not what I paid for.

Dark brown with a light brown head that diminishes quickly. Aroma is mostly a lighter chocolate with a decent amount of roast, yes quite roasty. Flavor is decadently sweet chocolate wtih a buttery finish. Unlike any other chocolate I have sampled in a brew. The buttery finish seems out of place, but nice nonetheless. Body is rich, malty and smooooooth. So very smooth, but I cant get over the distinct butter in the finish. Sweet chocolate.

There is an underlying bitterness too, much like bittersweet chocolate with a slightly sour overtone.  The palate is moderate, a little sticky but not bad.  There isnt much hint of alcohol, other than a little warming a minute or so later, and there seems to be very little carbonation, even after the foamy head.

Served in its own classy tulip-type glass, Chocolate Bock has an impressive appearance, fully, impenetrably black, with a fine, upstanding toasted tan head.
 Aroma is fine as well, with hefty cocoa character wafting out of the glass.
Taste starts out good, nice chocolate, very malty, hints of fruit, but the body gives way after a while, and the finish becomes syrupy sweet, leading to an odd, medicinal tang, that stays too long on the palate, and ultimately repels. The first half of every gulp is good, but it ends badly, molasses meets Robitussin.

4167,"2004-12-18",2.7,"I vowed that I would never try this beer due to the exorbitant price. But I got a .3 L tulip of this stuff at Delilahs in Chicago on draft for $4--not so bad considering. The waitress there said its much better on tap than in the bottles. Im not sure if you knew a whole hell of a lot about beer but she was super hot so Im assuming shes correct and I feel for those who sampled this from bottles if it was much worse than this.
Dark garnet with a creamy head that leaves short-lived sheets of lace. Very mild nose of bread yeast and a little cocoa. Flavor is much more pronounced but forced and lacking in subtlety. Both very chocolate and very bock. Or, Very artificial chocolate flavor and over-sweet bock with a strange sour twinge.  I think a rich, roasty stout would have been a much better vehicle for such a strong chocolate treatment.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Starts sweet, and sugary with lots of chocolate, before this becomes a little less sweet and cloying in the middle.  Mild roastiness.

Deep brown opaque color minimal tan head.
Aroma of rich malt with a distinct chocolate touch.
The chocolate in the flavor is unlike that of the chocolate flavor that roasted malt has. This doesnt taste much like a Bock although it isnt a bad brew. Somewhat of a novelty to be sure and if it were $2.50 a bottle instead of the $15+ that I have seen, it would be a worthwhile brew.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"

I dunno, somehow it just doesn't do it for me. If I want a bock I'll buy a good German bock. If I want nice chocolate I'll buy some nice chocolate (perhaps Sharffen Berger).

 Rating # 560
Pours a dark chestnut colored body with a foamy tan cap on top. The aroma is amassed with dark fruits and assorted nuts. Notes of: plums, dates, figs, cashew, Brazilian nuts, and almond. The flavor is rather chocolaty; its actually very nice! Long suggestions of chocolate and coconut, I even find huge hints of vanilla in here. Its odd because this beer has a very unique balance of bitter sweet. There is a full-size note of tartness that is found right in the middle of the palate sensations.. but sweet and smoky hints of maple syrup in beginning and finish.  The palate has a pretty velvety texture and there is a sweet chocolate covered coffee bean finish. 
 Overall I am pleasantly surprised to find that this beer does not suck donkey ass like I thought it was going to. I had 8 months of buyers remorse since paying $15 for his bottle, and now I can finally let it go.. This is pretty damn tasty!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
4167,"2004-07-26",3.4,"Caramel brown hue with ruby highlights an presented a thick creamy tan head and outstanding lace. Very smoky and mocha aroma with hints of dry apples, light piney hops, and dusty yeast esters. The taste is sweet and lactic milk chocolate with roasted grain background. Fruity (cherry and prune) midsection leads to a smoky and lightly bitter finish. The mouthfeel is lush and lively with a crisp bite towards finish. Worth $14-20? Nope, not even close.   I do think it’s worth a try if you can partake of someone elses purchase.  Too much chocolate and not enough bock.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"

The we tasted the beer and pretty much it all went to hell from there, or at least to mediocrity. The taste is obviously heavily of chocolate, but this nasty rancid milk aftertaste consumes your taste buds after a few sips.

The taste - well, suffice it to say the chocolate is subtle, not forward, and there's a definate sweetness overall to the beer.  Similar, in a way, to how the sweetness is a major component of their  Sam Adams Double Bock.  The addition of the chocolate allows this beer to be enjoyed after dinner, with or without dessert.

Sam Adams certainly didn't skimp on their grain bill as there's boatloads of barley in here.  Some slight raisiny flavors with other dried fruits.  The Scharffen Berger chocolate taste is present, but extremely faint.  All in all, if you enjoy bocks and want a thick, rich, fairly sweet brew, and have lots of cash, this is the beer for you!","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"

Definately tastes more like real chocolate than chocolate stouts.  Musty and earthy.  Has an acidic, tannic quality that detracts from the overall mouthfeel.  Worth drinking, not worth the price tag.","Westminster, Maryland, USA","LordHedgehog"
4167,"2004-02-22",4.0,"Dark chocolate brown color with lots of ruby orange highlights glowing around the edges and even a bit within the body. Thin frothy tan head, thickly sticking lace in small blobuels. Aroma is a bit subdued and comes across fairly clean with bakers chocolate and light coffee bean freshness with some darker fruits underneath of plum, banana, and raisin. Seems closer to a baltic porter, which wouldn't be bad, but this nose was a bit softer then anticipated. Taste has some nice layers, fairly complex, I get more of the dark fruits of plum, raisin, and a touch of banana sweetness and some solid roasty tones from sweetish black malts giving slight coffee and burnt molasses then I get any real chocolate, which remains lighter then expected as well. A bit of dryness to it like cocoa powder skips about palate. Feel is slightly buttery and silken smooth with a somewhat thinner body, but respectably solid with some very slight dryish sweet tones within the maltiness and a very mild hop surface. Pretty nice drinking with some nice things going for it, but I found the price of $13 for the fancy engraved label and bottle is way too much for what comes out of it.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Silky, somewhat syrupy mouthfeel. Soft. Delicate flavor is a mixture of mellow toasted barley, vanilla and dark chocolate that quickly turns dry from the hops. Odd lingering sweetness competes with the hops in the finish. Chocolate is present throughout. Pleasant overall. I'd like to see this beer packaged in a 6-7oz size, more appropriate for the style.

Pours lightly and fizzy with extreme carbonation, large bubbles coating all sides of glass, bottom of glass, and rising as a large bubbly soda-pop head, fastly fading.  Color is red-tinged brown.  Aroma is mild, with a definite baker's chocolate note, some ash, some caramel, and a hint of metal.  Front is remarkably non-sweet, with a clean clear chocolate flavor dominating the middle and finish, which is notably dry.  A possible cookieish graham cracker flavor is also apparent.  If this is a bock, its likely based off of their caramel malted Sam Adams Double Bock, which, like this beer, lacks true Munich malt melanoidin components.  As the beer warms, the caramel flavors become more pronounced and remain on the palate for some time - dominating the aftertaste after the dry chocolate finish fades.  The body wants to be full, but the strong carbonation carries it quickly and fuzzily in the mouth, fortunately with little bite.  The beer seems to flatten quickly in the glass, losing its liveliness and approaching cloying.
