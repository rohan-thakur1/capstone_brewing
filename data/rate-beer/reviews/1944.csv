1944,"2017-05-12",3.8,"Obtained on a trip to eastern New Mexico in a fortunate circumstance. The 16 oz can delivers a lights-out black liquid and hardly any head. Stouts do that sometimes in my experience. The nose is subtle, cocoa and something herbal. The first drink is fine, a malty dark chocolate, roasted pecans and a touch of caramel. Not imperial stout big taste. Something much more subdued. A slick and fullish mouth feel and an extended medium-bitter finish. Entertaining without being superb. Malpais Stout continues the La Cumbre tradition of great graphics on the can.","Midland, Texas, USA","KevinReddirt"

1944,"2016-05-16",3.1,"Can. Head is initially average sized, frothy, brown, mostly diminishing. Body is black (non-opaque, flashlight tested). Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (roasted grain, unsweetened chocolate), with a light note of peppermint. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.

Surprisingly timid nose with very little going on...its rare that I find a stout this shy to show its aromas, even after warming. Whats more odd is that it smells like peppermint was added. The mouthfeel and flavor balance are nice, though, so even though the aroma offers virtually nothing to lure you in, its a pleasant sipper. Third try from this brewery and still not finding any magic here unfortunately. Maybe theyre only notable from draft? Dunno.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

1944,"2016-05-02",3.9,"Its an exhausting day and definitely spring, but still cool in the evening; the perfect evening for a stout. Ive been looking at this and wanting it badly, but wanted it to be right for the moment. The instant I peel back the tab on this brew, I know Ive made the right choice.
- The aroma is espresso; a dark, roasted nutty chocolate, and I can smell the richness of it, and it promises so much. I pour, and the body seems lighter than I expect from the aroma. Deep brown, a ruby reflection in the light darkens as the beer fills the glass. The foam rises, a creamy latte hue, and eventually develops a two finger depth; the head thick and spongy, visually quite beautiful.
- The scent is arousing, my mouth watering in anticipation, and I sip through the thick suds, drawing the creamy beer over my lips. The body is almost downy on my tongue, surprisingly light but heavy in experience. Old leather and a touch of ash adds a bit of romance to the flavor, the malts commanding, but not overpowering.
- Smooth and dreamy, the carbonation gives a lift to the body, and carries the whole experience through to an immensely gratifying finish. Consistent and delicious...right down to my very last, very sad drop.","USA","lightbias"

1944,"2013-01-10",3.9,"32oz Growler from La Cumbre; November 2012
Cascading pour from the growler, end up with a two finger thick, nicely pale brown tinged head; this leaves lots of lacing stuck to the sides of my glass as I work my way through this beer. The beer is an almost black color that shows an opaque, but concentrated, clear, brown / amber tinge around the edges. The aroma has an ample roasted / toasted nutty character to it. This is backed by notes of concentrated, cold coffee, and ample roasted hay notes.

Sweet, roasted, bitter, and lingering on the palate, this beer has a nice balance of notes. The finish really grabs the palate with bitterness from both the hops and the ample roasted malt character. The beer has a nice fullness to it, it isnt remotely cloying though, but sticks to the palate during each sip, and lingers just a bit, but the bitter roast malt and hop character dry things out enough that you want to take another sip quite frequently. Accentuating and balancing flavors to the predominant roast notes of cocoa, light coffee liquor, and burnt molasses. Nice, smooth, and creamy textured, especially as some of the carbonation wears of and the beer warms up. Smoky, roasted notes, touches of burnt brown sugar

Big roasty nose, with toasted nuts, chocolate, brown sugar, and a complex slate of dark malts. Flavor goes the same but doesnt have the same depth and richness. Medium body, medium carbonation, roasty mouthfeel, and beautifully roasty finish. Excellent stout.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

1944,"2012-07-13",3.8,"7/13/12. Growler shared by hopscotch! Nice black pour, maybe some ruby on the edges. At first sip and sniff I was thinking dry Irish, but a rich sweetness and thickness develops alongside the roasted malts. Graininess and sweet chocolate in the aroma with touches of coffee. Nice sweet chocolate entry with a hint of sourness and lingering dryness from roasted malts. Nice!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
1944,"2012-07-09",3.9,"Growler Pours murky dark brown with a small, creamy, mushroom-colored head. The nose is mainly of brownies, but also offers fudge with traces of milk chocolate and espresso. Full-bodied and super velvety with lazy carbonation.  The flavor is deeply roasted and medium to heavily bitter  dark chocolate and charcoal are the main components. Mid-length, burnt, bitter finish. Well done, but a little too bitter for the style and most importantly, my particular tastes. Pulls up just shy of being world class due to its abundance of black malt and hop-heaviness.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

1944,"2012-02-14",4.0,"On tap at La Cumbre. Havent had this in probably 4-5 months, but Im glad I opted for it this time. Im surprised this doesnt float more peoples boats on here as its very much the type of stout I enjoy. Grainy. Relatively lacking in chocolate. You get the dry, ashiness of dark chocolate in the finish, but not much. I really enjoy the malt character in the finish. Smooth and creamy. Maybe a bit too much hop bitterness.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","ketchepillar"
