1379,"2016-12-07",3.9,"Poured into a pilsner glass, the appearance was a mellow burnt amber color with a nice transparency about it. Quickly dissipating fingers worth of white foamy head. Spotty messy lacing.
The aroma had a wonderful blend of the bitter to sweet grassy hops to the caramel to nutty to bready malts.
The flavor leans malty sweet rich with the malts and transitions nice and clean into the aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body. Great sessionability about it. Carbonation feels good. Malts fine tune the body with a nice smoothness to it.
Overall, damn nice Munich Dunkel lager that I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
1379,"2016-11-23",3.5,"From a pounder into a pint glass. Pours an absolutely gorgeous dark ruby red. Frothy white head and lacing. Mild aroma of cherry and bread. Mouthfeel actually could use a little more carb. Seemed kind of flat. Taste was very nice. Light fruit and bread with some cheeseyness too... but very mild. Solid beer and lots of flavor for a 5% beer without much hops.","Philly, Pennsylvania, USA","dagimp"

1379,"2016-11-22",4.0,"Can pour into taster cup at One Stop Market 30th Anniversary. Appearance is medium dark brown (like a light cola), mild head and lacing, decent sparkle. Aroma is a rich, savory malt aroma--a deep rich cracker/biscuit, with mild caramel. Taste is mildly smoky, rich roasted malt bordering on chocolate but not, a fatty/savory flavor almost like a wheat thin--very tasty. Palate is medium bodied with thick frothy, creamy texture, lively carbonation and mainly sweet biscuit/cracker malt finish that is dry and crisp.

Palate follows with focus on the malt but a nice crisp earthy bitterness and lingering toasted grain flavors accentuate the round lightly honey sweetness of the malt. Taste good with my smoked turkey and rice soup and pairing soups with beer is like pairing dignity and respect with our new president elect.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"

1379,"2016-06-10",3.6,"Draft @ Backcountry Pizza in Boulder, April 2015: Clear russet. Persistent fine-bubbled white foam. Inviting aromas of plum jam, chocolate wafer cookie, maple sugar, milk chocolate and damp breadcrust. Underlying orangey fruitiness. Snug carbonation. Opens with a slightly wet haylike quality, with well-defined pecan and bouncy tobacco notes beneath. Overt plummy esters and orangelike notes saturate the core which is otherwise fairly lean. A Munich-derived punch of chocolate-drizzled toffee imparts plentiful richness, though the malt doesnt contribute much in the way of texture, and consequently a sugary sweetness continues unabated. Some limpness to the malt, as well. A very mild herbal and licorice-y spice wavers in and out of the maple-kissed, lip-smacking sugars. Multilayered malt does show the occasional flash of melanoidins, although the character is more akin to wet breadcrust and brown sugar than suggestive of being decoction-mashed. An abundance of snappy cookie and starchy malt is backed by raisiny sugars and a noble-like sass of licorice. This is a tad sweet, which keeps it from being slammable, but overall its a complexly malty and nicely polished lager that comes off as Bavarian in origin, despite the very curious usage of Glacier (somehow it works, much to the credit of the brewer). Well done.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1379,"2016-06-09",3.2,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2016 Draft at Jons Bar & Grille. Poured a murky copperish gold with an off-white gushing head (possibly due to the specific keg or line) that left some fine points of lace. Slim aroma. Full-bodied juicy dark lager. Well toasted bready cereal grains. Brown amber fruit. Blood oranges. Dried apricots. Prunes. Whole wheat bread. Some herbal. Not bad but cannot get enthusiastic about it.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","NikkTwist"
1379,"2016-06-03",3.6,"My Bottom Line:
Toasted earth dominates this delicate lager, yielding plenty of bready connotations.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A healthy head of foam covers the misty ochre red.
-Hops are rather shy throughout. This is an all-cereal affair.
-Mouthfeel is ample and natural. Great job there, as usual.
-The finish is rather quiet; not much malt, hop or yeast presence.

1379,"2015-05-14",3.7,"Bottle upon debut, which was quite a while ago, back in 2010 or 2011??Anywho, they really dont make this stuff much anymore, seems like one batch every now and again? I thought this one had the most promise out of Smoke and Dagger and Hoponious Union. Bright ruby-auburn with a creamy beige head and good clarity.Melanoidin fruitiness in the nose is light but blends well with some leafy, herbal hops and mild tangerine-orange citrus aromatics. The maltiness shows dry toffee, honey and very soft sourdough touches. Works well and is quite cohesive. Perhaps not bursting with complexity, but thats no the point here. No flaws or alcohol.Very soft, malty, comforting texture rolls down the throat leaving notes of honey, graham cracker and light toffee, as fruity hops give off a floral/citrus flavor and leave no little/no acidity. Beer is well-attenuated, but stlil wonderfully malty. Goes down thoughtlessly and that heavy toasty sourdough flavor I associate with munich malt never builds up on the end. Maybe the fruity hops help? Dont know.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1379,"2013-02-22",3.3,"Poured from a pint bottle into a Harpoon snifter.

The color is a ruby red color with a gold tint. There is a slight wisp of off-white head with a good a good amount of carbonation.

The aroma is pretty sweet with some fruity cherry aroma in the nose. There is a slight touch of grainy flavor in the nose as well.

The taste has a candy light flavor that has a nice sweetness that is missing from some lagers but not this one. There is an ale like characteristics that is found here in the juicy fruit flavor with a cherry and grape flavor that also has the faintest crisp flavor and feel.

This beer does have a lighter crispness that is like a lager but gives off a fruit taste that punches the tongue like an ale. This beer seems to want to go places it might not be prepared to do.
