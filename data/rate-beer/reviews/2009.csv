2009,"2016-11-14",3.4,"22 ounce bottle from Badger Spirits in Beloit, WI, served a little below cellar temperature in a Guinness glass. Big smooth fine-bubbled tan head tops the dark, near-opaque maple body, thinning quite slowly and lacing thickly...lightly nutty aroma offers a touch of tart cherry as well, a bit of chocolate and vanilla; theres an unfortunate hint of detergent here as well when the bottle is first opened but that fades almost completely away...the body is moderately sweet with a nutty oiliness that grows through the tasting, climaxing in a somewhat bitter, drier finish; theres also a milky, lactic sourness here that is faint enough to only add a bit of complexity, not to spoil the thing...chocolate-milk soft mouthfeel, low carbonation - almost too low I think. This is pretty good but I have to say this is one TG beer where I dont get the fuss; sure its above average for the style but it strikes me as a little flawed and not any more exciting than most examples of this boring type of brew.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

2009,"2016-02-23",3.7,"Had at the source and received in a pint glass.

3.75 A: Deep dark murky brown color. Poured up to nearly the top of the glass, but a short creamy tan head is present.

4.5 S: Big toastiness and nuttiness - simply super potent. Hints of cocoa powder that dries it up a bit. Semi-dry overall. A truly giant nose.

4.0 T: Toasty and nutty but just not as powerful as the nose. Approaching moderate bitterness. Cocoa powder, woodiness, and semi-dry overall.

3.5 M: Medium body. Moderate carbonation which is surprisingly bity with a light-moderate creaminess.

4.0 D: Another winner. I wish they had more non-hop forward beers because this one was great.

2009,"2016-01-31",4.0,"22 oz bottle shared with ebone1988. Got this beauty from Al! Thanks dude. The pour is a great dark brown/light black with a lighter tan head and a couple spots of lace. The aroma is pretty great. There is a ton of chocolate with a little nuttiness and a nice roast that I didn't see coming. It's pretty plain for a brown, but very good. I'm a fan. The flavor is very thin. There is a light chocolate and a hint of nuttiness again, before it turns to a nice roasted malt. It's simple and nice. The mouth feel is pretty good. You almost have to work the carbonation out, which isn't that great. Overall it's quite thin and lightly carbonated. The aftertaste is great. It's lingeringly roasty chocolate and little nuttiness. This is a pretty good beer. One of the best Browns I've had.

2009,"2015-12-10",4.1,"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, unreadable date stamp on the shoulder. Pours clear nearly opaque very dark brown color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted dark bread, nuttiness, herbal, floral, and roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted dark bread, nuttiness, herbal, floral, and roast/toasted earthiness. Moderate amount of herbal and roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate, cocoa, coffee, toasted dark bread, nuttiness, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; with a great roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/silky, and lightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an excellent roasty brown ale style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt and light-moderate earthy hop flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink. This felt more like a brown porter with the balanced dark/bready and roasted malt flavors; but was still a very enjoyable offering regardless.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Smells almost like a dry stout with a layer of brown sugar. Taste is lightly sour dry malt, a little milkiness, a touch of nuttiness, and a hint of smoke. Medium and thinnish. Still pleasant, but I think something was a bit off in this batch.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

2009,"2013-10-20",3.9,"Growler... RBWG 2013 Deep, dark brown pour with ruby highlights and a mid-sized, frothy, khaki head. Decent retention. The nutty, malty nose offers a blend of tea biscuit, caramel and chocolate malts. Medium to full-bodied and silky with modest carbonation. The robust, bittersweet flavor delivers heaps of toasted nuttiness and 85% dark chocolate. The flavor leans more toward being bitter than sweet, but is excellently balanced overall. Nourishing, roasty, moderately bitter finish. A bit reminiscent of CCBs Maduro Oatmeal Brown Ale.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

2009,"2013-08-27",3.8,"Draft at TG. Pours dark brown with khaki head. Porter nose: roasty, chocolate, a little nutty. Thick, chewy texture. Chalky chocolate, finishes with roast bitterness. Overall: solid porter/stout. A brown ale you say? In name only, says me (but what the hell do I know?).","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

2009,"2013-03-06",3.5,"Old people have problems that you havent even considered yet!
 An 85-year-old man was requested by his Doctor for a sperm count as part of his physical exam. The doctor gave the man a jar and said, ""Take this jar home and bring back a semen sample tomorrow."" The next day the 85-year-old man came to  the doctors office and gave him the jar, which was as clean and empty as on the previous day. The doctor asked what happened and the man explained, ""Well, doctor, its like this--first I tried with my right hand, but nothing. Then I tried with my left hand, but still nothing. Then I asked my wife for help. She tried with her right hand, then with her left, still nothing. She tried with her mouth, first with the teeth in, then with her teeth out, still nothing. She even called up Arleen, the lady next door and she tried too, first with both hands, then an armpit, but still nothing. The doctor was shocked! ""You asked your neighbor?"" The old man replied, ""Yes, none of us could get the jar open.""",".....Manchester United.........., Texas, USA","SudsMcDuff"
2009,"2013-02-25",3.8,"Growler shared at RBWG grand tasting, poured a dark brown color with aromas of bischits, roast, nuts, and cocoa.  Flavors are the same andthey blended nicely.  Another solid beer from these guys.","Florida, USA","burg326"
2009,"2013-02-19",3.6,"Draft shared with the missus at the brewpub (Decorah, IA). Pours a bigger deep brown hue, dark body gets towards opaque, a bug bubbly head atop is loose but films well, laces ok. No real glow on the edges. Aromas are gentle brown and earthy malts that grow, a touch dry, nutty, faint touch of cocoa. Brown malt, carmelization, and earth. Gentle toastiness, biscuits grow, kiss of earthy hops. Initial is medium bodied, firm big tea and carmelized front end. Some toffee, toast, big biscuits and brown malt. Tea, big earth, some dry bitterness hits the palate. A bit acrid, firm dryness into the middle and backend, roasty, tobacco, pretzels, biscuits, bready malts, wheat bread. Backend is gentle cocoa, tobacco, gentle coffee or roasty feel, earthy bit carmelization, brown malts. Finish is pretzels, acrid toastiness, toffee, and dryness. Fun beer, a bit intense. Lacks the typical sweetness. Quite dry and toasty, but not all that hoppy. Ok.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2009,"2012-12-20",3.9,"My apologies for this non malt liquor rate. Jesus this is good. Chocolatey, with a nice nuttiness to it. Lightly sweet with an aggressive perceived bitterness to even that out. I think I drained my pint in 4 gulps. This isnt a brown ale. Brown ales suck.","@ $13.99, Iowa, USA","DietPepsican"
2009,"2012-12-20",3.9,"On Tap.  Aroma: cocoa, some dark sugar, chocolate malts, toffee, slightly nutty.  Pours brown, fairly murky, off-white/tan head has average retention and dissipates to a lasting ring.  Flavor focuses on the malt.  Chocolate, caramel, and biscuit malt notes, also a hint of dark fruit.  A light almond/pecan note also shows up in the finish.  Malt character is fairly rich and full, with an appropriate touch of sweetness.  Just enough bitterness to help balance the malt - not much hop flavor.  Medium body and carbonation.  A very nice brown ale.","Iowa, USA","ekoerper"
