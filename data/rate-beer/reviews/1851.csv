1851,"2016-07-28",3.9,"July 31st, 2014 - The second line in the grid of my lovely Summer Camp beer box belongs to the Yonder Bock, brewed in collaboration with Cigar City. After exiting the can, it burns with a fiery, ember red, as if fuming to be removed from its metallic place of rest. The smell is crowded with tropical fruit flavors, including pineapples, mangos and papayas. And as if rounding out the mid-century American treatment of these fruits, there is a tiny cherry note in there too, delicately placed on top of the pile of exotic, acidic sweets. The body is solid, easy to tackle, and the flavor begins light and sweet, the maraschino cherry with an introductory trumpet of bright, syrupy sugar. Then mango flavors ease in, before cutting off suddenly, leaving a pale fruit juice flavor that ebbs long into the aftertaste. Theres a lot of the South Pacific here, and I adore it - the beer for tiki-philes.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
1851,"2016-01-24",3.5,"12 oz can from Beer Camp series 2014. Pours a deep copper orange color and topped by a small off white head of foam that slowly settles to a thin film and leaves scant patches of lace on the glass. The aroma shows notes of tropical fruit with mango, pineapple, and other ripe fruit to go with a sweet malt base of toasted caramel, bread, and toffee. Just a touch of citrus hop bitterness provides balance. The flavor follows and is quite sweet with the fusion of sweet caramel and toffee malts to go with the ripe tropical fruits of mango and pineapple. Some mild citrus hop bitterness tries to offer balance on the back side. Medium bodied and slick on the mouthfeel with balanced carbonation that leads to a sweet and fruity finish with some trace heat from alcohol left behind. Nice mash up of flavors but ultimately ends up too sweet for my liking.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

1851,"2015-07-23",3.7,"12 oz can served in a pint glass. Pours darkish amber with medium slightly creamy white head. Aroma is boozy sweet caramel malt, with a decidedly crisp herbal, floral note on the back. Taste is rich lightly sweet caramel malt, again the potency of the malt is easily evident. Clean juicy floral notes on the back balance nicely. I know blocks are pretty minimal on the hops, but would work so well with the malt and everything else here. Pretty sure these tropical notes are not common in a bock, but a great twist on the style.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"

Maybe the can was too old, or maybe I wasnt really expecting the right thing from a bock, but it ended up being a mish mash of malty sweet with pungent hops.

Aroma: An okay aroma of sweet malts and some fruity notes.

Appearance: Pours a dark orange-reddish, thick and frothy beige head, coating lace.

Flavor: It has a sweetish flavor as well, it feels like it is lacking in balance.

Palate: It has a pretty smooth mouthfeel that is quite creamy.

Overall Impression: 
Not my favorite beer, but Im happy to have given it a try as I thought these beers were long gone at this point.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Caramel and toasted grain flavor with over-ripen pineapple and sweet citrus. Medium-full body, smooth and creamy texture, slightly chewy. This is a good beer, but I was really hoping for more of the tropical fruit to come through. Maybe its just getting a bit too old at this point since it was brewed back in May 2014? Drinks a bit thick and too heavy; the alcohol doesnt hide quietly in the background.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

1851,"2014-12-09",2.8,"Clear copper and bronzed coloured body with a nice clear glow and a rich, two centimetre tall tan head. Aroma of alcohol, metal, malt, nuts, raisins and a touch of apples and pears. Medium-bodied; Assertive malty character with a defined nuttiness and pungent earthy character that doesnt let go - strong until the very end. Aftertaste shows some light sweetness from caramel and toffee, a bit of the raisin and earthy pungency and not too much pleasant at the end. Overall, a decent bock at best with some rather earthy and strong flavours that dont show off too well. I sampled this twelve ounce can purchased from Harris Teeter in Arlington (Pentagon Row), Virginia on 30-July-2014 for US$22,00 for the twelve pack, sampled at home in Washington, a few steps away, on 09-December-2014.

Poured a caramel, auburn, mostly-clear color with five fingers of rocky, khaki-white head. Decent amount of bubble streams coming up at various parts from the bottom of the glass. Semi-layered, sporadic foamy spots of lacing along the sides of the glass. Great-looking retention on the top all the way down. (Sight - 4.25)

This was poured into a pilsener.
The appearance was a bronzed amber color with a semi-thick rocky two and a half finger white to off white head. Theres a decent amount of semi-bubbly and somewhat foamy lacing.
The smell started off with a light toasted caramel note and then had a graceful amount of tropical fruits backing it up nicely.
The taste had more of a combination of the tropical fruits and toasty caramel malts coming through fairly sweet.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a sharp carbonation running about it. Theres nothing graceful about how this one rolls across my tongue as theres a decent sharp fruitiness there.

Palate: It has a good amount of bitterness with a medium body and it lingers on the palate. It is not a traditional feeling Maibock.


Overall: The beer is good if you are looking something like a strong Pale Ale or a slightly weaker IPA. I wouldnt know it was a bock by tasting it.

A great entry in the Beer Camp pack, this tropical bock has hallmarks of Cigar Citys distinctive style. Of all the offerings in the package this is perhaps the one that I wish could be released on its own. I am sure six packs would fly off the shelves.

Aroma / Appearance - A creamy caramel hue is the tint of cream soda. A fresh vanilla head adds pleasant contrast. Mangoes, malt, and definitive tropical aspects shine in the air. Honey and graham crackers add more depth. Like a slice of fresh pie it makes the whole room sweeter.

Flavor / Palate - Mango, peach, and bright citrus prepare the senses for a tropical beach invasion. Creamy malt driven sips carry strongly towards a dry finish of candy and malts. Refreshing and easy to drink, this is definitely among the best the Beer Camp box has offered so far.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1851,"2014-08-08",4.1,"Poured from can into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a clear orange amber color with a thick two finger white head that has fantastic retention. The head slowly fades over a long time to leave a fantastic level of foamy lacing on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The nose of the beer heavy of a tropical fruit smell with lots of mango and pineapple as well as a decent sum of tangerine and some apricot. Along with the fruity smells comes a decent bready and doughty aroma as well as a little bit of a grainy and floral/herbal hop aroma.
 Taste  The taste begins with a bready taste mixed with some caramel and fruity sweetness of a tropical nature. Mango and tangerine are the heaviest upfront and grow stronger and stronger as the taste moves onto the end getting rather strong at the finish of the taste. Along with the increase in the sweet fruity flavors, some small amounts of hop come to the tongue, with them being mainly of a floral and herbal nature. Some flavors of pear and pineapple come at the very end, leaving a rather bready and fruity sweet flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the average side. For the combination of sweet and bready flavors of the brew the thickness and carbonation are quite nice as they support the sweet and bready nicely all while keeping it rather drinkable and refreshing of the fruity flavors.
 Overall  At 7.7 % abv the alcohol taste is almost non-existent and the flavor exhibits big fruity and bready flavors. A very drinkable Maibock with a nice flavor profile. Even while on the slightly sweeter side , this was a rather good drinker.","","Darkmagus82"

The aroma is an interesting mix of a clean caramel malt character and sweet tropical fruit notes. Im getting passionfruit, mango, guava, strawberry and tangerine. Not much acidity, just fruit sweetness. That said, the hops are a bit milder than expected, given the description. Malt is nice and doughy, fairly rich. Good amount of caramel. However, the malt sweetness with the sweet hop flavors is a bit much. Kinda reminds me of cheap strawberry jam with a bit too much fruity sweetness for its own good. The taste is more restrained in that regard but not a huge improvement. Toasty malt flavors, mild hop bitterness and flavor. Tangerine rind, dried out crystal malt, some bubblegum.

1851,"2014-07-26",3.6,"This is rather hop forward for a bock or, rather, the American hop character is not traditional for the style at all but, regardless, this is a good beer. It pours clear orange amber w/ a scant white head of fine bubbles. Its nose is of mandarine orange and pineapple, very much tropical fruit based, but much milder than you would typically expect from an IPA or similar style. Once tasted, the malts come out much more. At first they are honey-like and simple but as you dig in deeper, there is a nice nutty edge to them that melds quite nicely w/ the fruity hops. This is a full bodied brew to be sure and does get a bit heavy on the palate as it warms, lending a juicy texture to support the fruit. I am enjoying this quite a bit but wish theyd have toned down the ABV a bit and went for a slightly dryer, more drinkable beer. Still, I enjoy the concept and execution aside from that.

Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, tropical/floral hops, and yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of caramel, toast, brown bread, pineapple, guava, mango, orange zest, pear, apple, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast eathiness. Fair amount of earthy/peppery bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, brown bread, pineapple, guava, mango, orange zest, pear, apple, herbal, floral, light pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit.

1851,"2014-07-24",3.5,"Canned on June 4, 2014.
Appearance: The body is clear with a vibrant hue of amber. The head is enormous on the pour, producing a tall and dense light tan head that has great retention.
Aroma: The aroma is a mix of malty and fruity. Some dense caramel and malt sweetness are noted alongside orange and mango. The aroma is decent, but lacks in strength. 
Taste: This was described to me as powerfully malty with a pretty big hop presences and thats a great description. A strong malt base hints at brown sugar, caramel and bread, with a slightly tropical overlying hop presence. Mango and papaya come to mind. This is definitely maltier than bitter, a bit cloying even if I drank enough. Solid drink though with a semi-dry mildly bitter finish.
Palate: Full-bodied with mild carbonation.
Overall: Decent beer for sure. As a heller bock this stands on its own, but the tropical tones are nice. I wish this were a bit more tropical though, and I wish that this were more fragrant. Good beer though.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Aroma is nice and malt forward with quite a bit of toasted bread, caramel and grain. Light fruitiness from the hops but its not as prominent as the can led me to believe it would be; still hoppy for a traditional Heller Bock.
Pours a very clear ruby color with some amber and copper notes. Small, somewhat thin, tan head that recedes quickly to a film on top. 
Flavor, like the aroma is dominated by a nice, rich malt character. Lots of toasted bread with secondary notes of caramel, grain and biscuit. Medium light bitterness and sweetness with faint hop flavors of tropical fruit. hop notes are more prevalent than in the aroma but still subdued. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied but with a crisp finish and medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth.

1851,"2014-07-21",2.9,"Can from the Beer Camp box. So, tropical maibock with some exotic and experimental hops. Cool. Except this tastes basically like a regular bock. The pour is crystalline light copper with a tall white head. Aroma is easily identifiable as a bock with its vegetable bouquet. Sweet malts are evident with hints at caramel, toast and brown sugar. There are notes of squash and papaya as well. Im surprised to see the 7.7% abv listed here. I didnt detect any sign of that. I must admit there are some suggestions of tropical fruit in the flavor but they get buried by the sweet malts and flavors of a salad. There arent any flaws and let me emphasize that I dont much get into bocks. The sweetness and vegetal notes here are characteristic of the style.

1851,"2014-07-17",3.3,"Can from QFC-UV
Large foamy coarse head atop red amber with rose highlights. Massively estery nose with juicy fruit gum. Initially sticky and a bit sweet, tropical fruit as promised, soapy bitterness - quite heavy for the style - on the close. This is one different and interesting but not really all that great to actually drink.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
1851,"2014-07-17",3.8,"Can: The aroma consists of moderate tropical fruits, light peach, citrus, honey, and a touch of grain. It pours a transparent amber with a large soapy off-white head that has great retention. There is a lot of soapy lacing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with moderate-heavy tropical fruit with light-moderate citrus. Moderate caramel comes into play in the middle. The finish has some light grain and just a hint of grass. Its medium bodied with mild carbonation and a somewhat sticky mouthfeel. Overall, the tropical fruit flavors compliment the Bock really well.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
1851,"2014-07-17",4.0,"This was a solid brew. I didnt expect this to be one of my favorites but guess again. On tap at CCBs beer camp shindig. Nose is huge tropical fruits! This is the only beer that had an aroma that made me smile. Peach, mango, sweet gummy worms, pineapple. Man, so nice. Flavor is semi-sweet, peach and mango notes, stone fruits, a nice malty backbone. Very good.","Florida, USA","OmegaX"
1851,"2014-07-16",3.8,"Pour is clear and amber almost whiskey like. Aromas of peaches, mangos and spice. The tropical flavors hit right up front and lead to malt, graham cracker, cinnamon, with a smooth finish.","Florida, USA","Weezel"
1851,"2014-07-16",3.8,"12 oz bottle from BC Across America variety pk- Pours clear golden orange with a two finger of white head that reduces leaving a ice cream float appearance.

1851,"2014-07-16",2.8,"12 ounce can. The aroma on this is of bubblegum and ethanol initially. Becomes rather toasted in the middle with some caramel and cereal hints. Transparent ruddy-amber body with a very small, dissipating whitish head. Disappointing head. Starts with a big sweet caramel flavor, which then gives way to a carbonated, ethanol astringency in the middle. Finishes with overly toastiness and an unpleasant bitterness.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

Clear, deep amber with a huge beige head.
Caramel, spice aroma...fruits.
Sweet, very malty flavour...caramel, candy-sugar.
More sweet than citrus driven, the tropiclas are there, but its almost in syrup form and prescence.

So I left my review above since its original. 6/4/5/3/10

1851,"2014-07-15",3.1,"Dark copper pour - nose of tropical fruits (mango, citrus, pineapple) dough, grain husks, green raisins - decent texture - fairly creamy in the mouth - fairly rich and sweet malt up front (honey, bread) - however, the malt gets a little husky late - some mango and orange arrive as the hops do - bitterness is a little harsh, abrasive, too high in acidity - finish is a little doughy, but there is also some apparent alcohol and a sharp acidity the lingers - some decent attributes, but ultimately, a little messy.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

The taste showcases some creative brewing with a woody tasting bock--I get sawdust, a dash of mango, pecans and vanilla. The palate was a bit thin and the carbonation was lively.

Nearly full bodied. Flavor is pretty roasty malt with mixed together fruits. Not easy to dissect this. Finishes something like melon/malt. Its malty, but not all that sweet.

Oh well, this rating is for those of out there who are similarly afflicted. There are dozens of us - dozens! Anyway, taste is pretty sweet, bready, with just a bit of bitterness to finish it off. .Palate: medium-full body, oily, average carbonation. Overall: shrug.

>> Pours clear deep copper, larger tan foam. Soda bubbles. Wispy lacing, good retention. Nose is fairly fruity, nice juiciness, mild orange juice. Taste is malty, some sweet fruit juice, sweet honey rolls, saltwater. Softer body, malt forward. Clean finish, nice balancing bitterness, not sticky at all and no astringency. Heavier malt body. Doesnt feel stale or nutty either, which is nice. I wonder what sort of logistical nightmare it was getting all of these beers to be completed at the same time without one having sat around getting stale.
