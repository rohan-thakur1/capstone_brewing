4573,"2017-04-27",3.7,"Quite an interesting beer. Clear deep golden with a wispy white head. Orange peel, coriander, zesty yeast spice, intense sweet notes. Full slick body. Hard to categorize. Enjoyable.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
4573,"2016-10-15",3.7,"22 oz bottle from Tavour shared with Tmoney99. Pours a clear, bright golden color with a small disappearing white head. The aroma and flavor have big, sweet malts, orange citrus, orange peel, sizable coriander, honey sweetness, pale malts, interesting beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
4573,"2016-10-14",3.6,"Bottle shared by alexsdad06. Poured cloudy copper color with an average frothy off-white head that was mostly lasting with good lacing. Medium citrus, spice and yeast aroma. Medium body with smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. This is an interesting beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
4573,"2016-10-01",4.0,"22 oz bomber from Tavour. Nose is orange zest, coriander, banana, and a malty backbone. Lightly hazy yellow with a big, lightly lacing off white head. Flavor is lightly sweet and fruity with some banana. Enjoyable.","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
4573,"2016-08-30",3.7,"i agree with Rubishysuff on this one. Not generally a big fan of imperialized styles that are all about subtlety - but this one works. Distinct yeastm coriander and both sweet and tart sharp orange peel on the nose and palate. Crisp and clean despite all that. Pretty high up there as far as witbiers go, and still refreshing despite a higher abv.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
4573,"2015-12-28",4.0,"Thanks to Dad, This was pretty good. All the qualities of a witbier just kicked up, sometimes that beer strategy doesnt work but this time it did. Very rich. Serving: bottle","Chicago, Illinois, USA","rubbishystuff"
4573,"2015-08-27",4.0,"Poured from the bottle of a four pack, looks orange with some yellow highlights not a collar to speak of. I havent tried many wits but I appreciate the current trend of making different beer in the imperial fashion. This beer is sweet and sticky up front, not much evidence of its alcohol content in the taste. Pear, apricot, honey, and mild carbonation is what I taste. I would not have enjoyed this beer as much in a sampling as I did drinking all 4, a taste does not do this beer justice. I am down with the imperial revolution.","Illinois, USA","TattooJack"
4573,"2015-05-19",3.4,"Poured from a 750 ml. bottle to my sampler at this years Glunz Global Beer Expo, displaying a hazed, golden color, with a presentable layer of soft white, bubbles & froth head foam, and spots & strands of lacing. The nose was sweet, with a blend of grain & esters that presented an impression of ripened fruit, a hint of banana, orange zest, and subtle spice as coriander, with a bit of clove-like phenols. A touch less than medium bodied, with fair carbonation, the taste was similar notes as the aroma, sweetness that was somewhat syrup-like, alcohol presence, and subtle tartness toward the finish. Not one to equate ""imperial"" with Witbier, but an enjoyable enough brew.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
4573,"2015-04-07",3.3,"Im usually a big fan of Imperial Anything but wit is a delicate, fresh, light&bright style with nuanced accents of fruit and spice. This Imperial Wit instead is a syrupy thing - - densely sweet, backed up with a medicinal antiseptic/alcohol spine. Seriously, it tastes like apricot cough syrup. The mouthfeel is great though. Its sort of an overcompensation from the frustration that overly light wits sometimes leave you with - - you long for just a bit more flavor, a bit more intensity, a bit more substance. This is the antidote for that, but its more an odd duck than something really enjoyable.","USA","alassio"
4573,"2015-04-04",3.7,"pours a hazy straw yellow. Very little head and it dissipates quickly. Aroma is big on the malt. Notes of spice, lemon, bannana and orange.Flavor of banana, orange, honey and coriander. Medium body. Light carbonation. creamy/sticky mouthfeel. slight acidic dryness in the finish. Alcohol is very hidden. Very good wit. Perhaps a bit more carbonation would send it over the top.","rochester hills, Michigan, USA","libertine"
4573,"2015-03-16",4.2,"12 ounce bottle into tulip glass, no bottle dating. Pours an opaquely hazy deep golden color with a 2 finger fairly dense white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty foamy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big lemon, apple, pear, orange peel, light banana, coriander, pepper, clove, wheat, honey, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and honey/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge lemon, apple, pear, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, wheat, honey, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Fair amount of earthy yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, apple, pear, orange peel, light banana, coriander, clove, pepper, honey, wheat, bread, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible robustness, balance, and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and honey/pale malt sweetness; with a great malt/yeast/spice balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a smooth, very creamy/bready, and lightly slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome imperial witbier style. All around great complexity, balance, and robustness of fruity/earthy yeast, spices, and honey/pale malt sweetness; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
4573,"2014-06-30",3.9,"750-ml bottle from wlvliquors. beautiful clear golden honey color. gives good head (with good pour). tasty fruity sweetness, i assume from the honey. clove? maybe. a great introduction to Ten Ninety.","Illinois, USA","zebra"
4573,"2014-06-01",3.4,"12 oz. bottle. Smart call, putting this in four packs, by the way. Pours an orangish amber color with a medium white head. Aroma of booze, mango, wit spice, coriander. Flavor is dominated by mango and fruit notes. Mild spice notes. Touches of spice, with apparent alcohol. Medium bodied with average carbonation. Finishes boozy with touches of spice.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
4573,"2014-04-17",4.1,"[Bottle] Hazy yellow pour with a frothy white head. Coriander and sweet wheat malts in the aroma. Hints of funk. Taste is heavy on orange peel, coriander, chamomile, sweet yeasty esters and dough. Finish is sweet, zesty and grassy. No detectable alcohol. Creamy and smooth palate. A great beer in my book.","Illinois, USA","troyc"
4573,"2014-04-15",3.8,"Draft. Super sweet version of it ""half"" counterpart, tons of sweet orange peel, if you like that flavor you will like this.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
4573,"2014-04-11",3.9,"I was really pleased with this one. Much fruitier than I expected, but it didn't disagree with me (usually I don't care for too-sweet and fruity). A very good ten-ninety product. Would definitely have it again!

4573,"2014-03-21",3.6,"A decent imperial wheat. Really fruity and wheaty. Smells fruity as well. Really east to drink with a smooth finish. Had at American junkie.

4573,"2014-02-22",5.0,"Had this at Au Cheval and see why its their go to Wit. This has a lot going on for a Wit and hides the alcohol extremely well. The honey adds a nice clove compliment to the coriander that sets this beer apart.","","Niners"
4573,"2013-08-07",3.7,"Had it on tap. Pours a clear golden with a moderate amount of carbonation. No head on it, but that was because of the pour. Aromas of orange peel and coriander, but was surprisingly mild. No alcohol detected on the tongue, and was surprisingly light. Yeasty flavors dominate all the way down, aftertaste of various spices. Very enjoyable beer.","Illinois, USA","DeliveryDriver"
4573,"2013-08-02",3.8,"Yeasty nose that does bring out some banana ester and coriander. But not overpowering. Bright, though slightly cloudy wit color in tasting glass. Taste does not give away any hint of the alcohol inside, just the smooth wit taste that scores close to a hefeweizen as well. Some sturdy malts instead of sweetness, and a note of Belgian funk or tartness.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
