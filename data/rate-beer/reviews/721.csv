Mouthfeel is medium and juicy with notes of bright citrus hop, fresh pine and clean malt bill. What is it that makes this a specialty grain and not an IPA?","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
721,"2015-06-28",3.7,"Fucken speciality grain ... total bollocks of a style that detracts from my IPA count in general.
Keg at Brew Dock, Dublin, 28/06/15.
Lightly hazed golden amber with a decent light beige covering. 
Nose is orange pith, bubblegum,  caramel malt, juicy hop strokes, light bread, honeydew melon.
Taste comprises sweet citric jus, pine resin, light candy bar, pink grapefruit. 
Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close peppered with juicy hop bitterness. 
Solid brew soured by being allocated to a shit 1 style.","Hazlemere, the lower Xhitlerns, Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Theydon_Bois"
721,"2015-06-14",3.2,"Sample from tap at the Oslo bar, Galway. Very similar to the gbb voyager 2015. Hoppy with grapefruit, zest, pine, fruit. Smooth but a little old hops flavour. Dry with medium bitterness and medium carbonation.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","ramboraffe"
721,"2015-04-28",3.5,"On tap at The Black Sheep, pours a hazy orange with a small white head. Nose is hugely fruity and quite hoppy, with tropical fruits upfront. Flavour is very hoppy and fruity as well, with tropical fruits, resinous hops, and just enough dry grainy malt to back. Massively fruity and hoppy. Nice IPA.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

721,"2015-01-17",3.3,"Keg at Against The Grain, Dublin. It pours a murky yellow/light brown/nutty color with a small tan head. Aroma is grainy, grassy, leafy, earthy, with notes of cereal, earth, pine cones. Taste is medium bitter and lightly sweet, with notes of bread, dried leaves, biscuit, grass, pine cones, cereals, lactose. Medium bodied with soft to good carbonation.

721,"2014-12-22",4.3,"oh God is that good...on draft, hazy gold in color, fluffy white head that leaves some nice lacing on the glass. Pine, floral, citrus hop aroma floating up from even a few feet away. Taste is the same which is lovely, but the extra step here is the mouthfeel, remove the astringent medicinal quality that some IPAs have and insert a hop bomb that rests on a cloud for your tasting pleasure.","Cloneen, IRELAND","beerfest5"

721,"2014-08-16",4.0,"Keg at ATG Dublin. Hazy light amber/orange, good bit of murk going on. Aroma is fab: incredibly fruit forward with tangerine, melon, mango, light lime and strawberry in there. Bit of spruce and slightly sweeter resin too. Taste gives all that juicy fruit, with orange, mango and strawberry giving it socks. Slightly sticky resinous note in there too, although quickly dries out with grapefruit and pine needles towards the finish. Solid doughy malt backbone, pretty full mouthfeel, nice biscuit character. Very solid balance, not overly bitter, but a really great flavour/aroma hop experience from start to finish. Never gets sticky, keeps on the right side of crisp. So good. As usual from these guys.","London, ENGLAND","Beermack"
