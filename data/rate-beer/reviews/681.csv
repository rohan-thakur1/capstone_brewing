681,"2017-06-02",3.7,"Madeira dominates the aroma. The flavor is more complex with dark fruit and the wood with the wine more in the background. Pours a dark amber with a thin head. Very nice.

681,"2017-04-19",4.1,"Deep dark amber color, tan head. Nice aroma of maple syrup drizzled over plums, raisins, dates. Taste has burnt caramel, vanilla, dark fruit. Delicious.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
681,"2016-08-19",4.4,"Gotta say - I like everything about this beer. The color - dark mahogany. The nose is well balanced between bourbon, beer and maple as is the flavor. Goes away really really quickly for an 11% beer. Nailed the barreling. Just awesome.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
681,"2016-08-03",3.5,"On tap @ Torpedo Room. Light brown colored beer with a surprisingly robust khaki head. A very large, sweet beer. Big time caramel, brown sugar, and vanilla. Pretty nice hit of maple, too. Subtle coconut and whiskey. The flavor is kind of just straight up dessert/sugar juice. Tons of maple, dark fruits, caramel, and vanilla. The whiskey character doesnt really cut through that much or even provide an obvious booze quality to break up the sweetness. Its nice to try, but this is a little much.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
681,"2016-06-27",4.1,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is sweet with a medium light maple note, lots of caramel and toffee. Soem brunt sugar and light treacle. A touch of toasted bread. Medium light oak notes with some lighter bourbon. A light herbal hop note with some alcohol. More maple as it warms. 
Pours a fairly clear, brown with burnt amber hues and a medium sized, thick, tan head that recedes slowly to the edges where it lingers. Medium light lacing and long legs. 
Flavor is fairly sweet with a lot of malt character. Lots of caramel and toffee with lighter toasted bread, burnt sugar, and treacle. A hint of a roast note. Medium maple notes with hints of coconut and vanilla. Light bourbon and oak notes. Medium bitterness with faint hop notes. Light alcohol spice in the finish. Lingering maple, caramel and bourbon. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a really nice beer. Im fairly impressed with these limited run beers that Sierra Nevada keeps putting out. Great maple notes, balanced with good bourbon barrel characteristics. Nice malt characteristics.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
681,"2016-06-26",4.1,"The bottle was picked up by marcus and brought to the table at the Capital Taproom and shared with bhensonb and myself.. Pours a muddy red with a light tan head. Lots of thick lacing rings. Nose of maple, vanilla, and dark ripe fruit. Flavor is rich, with a good mixture of maple, and fruit, some vanilla and bourbon and it finishes with wood and the bourbon. Excellent beer.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
681,"2016-06-25",4.0,"Bottle shared by Marcus. Pours darkly ruddy with a tan head. Aroma of wood, maple, maybe brown sugar, a little vanilla. Med body or so. Flavor is wood, maple, maybe brown sugar, a little bourbon. It has something a bit like spice - but maybe its wood. Or maple. Its a bit sweet, and the bourbon comes up a bit after awhile.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
681,"2016-06-25",3.9,"Bottle from City Beer. Pours reddish brown with a thick clinging beige head and a magnificent treacle and maple aroma. There is a medium-bodied dark molasses flavor with lots of maple and some nice vanilla and bourbon finish.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
681,"2016-05-30",3.6,"750mL bottle from the brewery, bottled 3/31/16 and shared by AdamC on 5/21/16.Good clarity in this deep mahogany-chestnut beer. Light beige head atop shows moderate to moderately strong retention.At first smell I get visions of the awfully over-barreled Ride That Bear, but as it slowly breathes and warms, the heavy barrel character subsides somewhat, leaving more maple, light woodsmoke and very little hop notes behind it. Big brown sugar and dark fruit notes definitely show off a true scotch ale with the bourbon definitely intensifying the overall character and contributing moderate coconut-like character. Vanilla, toffee and oak linger with a touch of alcohol apparent and no flaw.Rich, nearly sticky, but well-attenuated texture has plentiful vanilla, toffee and light roast with strong oak dryness. Maple sweetness perks up on the end and is quite enjoyable. Dark fruits, heavy oak and toffee lingering with a hint of earthy smoke.The fact that this thing is 2% stronger and 4 months younger than Ride That Bear and already tastes much more mellow speaks volumes to Sierra Nevadas quality (and less to the Bruerys). Still way too intense of a beer for my tastes and I wish Id tried it with another 3-6 months of age on it. But no doubt it should continue to mellow out and develop very nicely. Lots of potential, so a bit of leniency on my score.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

681,"2016-05-21",3.9,"750 ml Bottle shared by Adam, picked up at the NC, facility. Aroma is coconut, toasted oak, bourbon, maple... Holy shit! 
Dark fruit base with a blast of maple syrup. The bourbon helps cut the dark grains and dark fruit. Maple syrup is also cut by the bourbon. Wow. The flavor is deep and layered here. The ABV is mostly hidden. Awesome.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
681,"2016-05-21",3.7,"75CL. Picked this ale up at the brewery in NC. This is dark brown, 1 finger tan head. This smells REALLY good. Maple is present along with whiskey, coconut. Taste, this is a total maple bomb. Maple. like thats all I taste at the start and long in the finish. Coconut, vanilla, brown sugar. this is straight up dessert decadent.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
681,"2016-04-28",3.8,"On tap at the Torpedo Room. It pours a dark amber color with a light tan/orange head. The aroma has heavy caramel, oak, vanilla and lighter notes of maple syrup. Sweet barrel-aged goodness on the nose. The flavor is the same. A little more fruity plum/raisin notes with heavy sweet vanilla, oak, caramel, maple and coconut. Not too syrupy, but very sweet. No harsh solvents in this one. Good balance of dark fruit-like Scotch ale qualities and barrel aged character.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
