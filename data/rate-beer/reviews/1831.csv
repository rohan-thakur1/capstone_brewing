1831,"2016-04-02",3.4,"An overwhelming aroma of bourbon. Bourbon taste hits the tip of your tongue and burns the back of your throat. Not as strong as the aroma suggested.

Malty flavor with bourbon, caramel, vanilla and chocolate before a semi-roasty finish. Not bad by any means, but as good as Battle Axe is, it doesnt stand up to the barrel very well.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"

Aroma of vanilla, milk chocolate, toffee, dark and dried fruits (dates, figs, raisins), and some coffee roast. The flavor follows the same lines, also leaning more toward the sweet notes than the malty. The booze is really subtle here. Medium-bodied, with a smooth, sweet, malty mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Nice barrel treatment.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
1831,"2014-01-12",3.9,"Draft sample at Big Beers and Barley wines Dayton. Pours a clear dark brown with a small beige head. The aroma and flavor had moderate roast, dark fruits, nice barrel treatment with wood and the spirit, hints of chocolate and coffee and a touch of caramel. Creamy mouthfeel with medium body. The barrel smoothed this out. Not as big and bold as some of my favorites, but a solid beer nonetheless.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"

1831,"2013-09-19",4.1,"The taste starts off with some roasted malts reminiscent of coffee. Then, dark fruit emerges with some substantial malt heaviness. The notes of chocolate, licorice, anise and raisin all come together in an orgy of darkness. Theres some mild noticeable alcohol, but the lagering really made this smooth and complete. The taste is very pleasant and expressive. I really, really enjoy sampling this beer!","South Euclid, Ohio, USA","DoublEE"

Spicy, woody flavor. Dark chocolate, some dark fruit. Lightly spicy. Bigger body. Kind of lightly chewy texture. Moderate bitter taste. Bigger sweet. A little boozy, but good. Bourbon is definitely noticeable in this one.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

Flavor is big Bourbon but not much heat and lots of smoke not sure if its from the barrel or the beerbut almost tastes like a Scotch aged beer.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
1831,"2013-08-25",3.7,"2013-08-17. Black body with a modest tan head. 4+ Aroma of sweetish dark malt, light roast and modest bourbon. 7++ Flavour is pleasant, sweet dark malt, mild bourbon notes up front grow in subsequent sips. 7++ Average plus bodied palate, moderate carbonation. It is fairly simple but relatively balanced. The bourbon character is fairly restrained, to its benefit in my opinion. Growler, Campground Brewdown.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"

1831,"2010-10-18",3.5,"Cask @ Fat Heads.  Pours black with a big tan head.  Nose is bourbon, sugary plums, Brown sugar, molasses and some vanilla.  Flavor is brown sugar, sweet plums & figs, a solid booze hit.  Caramel comes out & dominates, complimented by roast & dark fruits in the finish.  Its a big beer but the serving size (6oz?) kept it from being overwhelming.","Buffalo, New York, USA","rudolf"
1831,"2010-10-16",4.4,"On cask at Fat Heads.  Pours black with a marshmellow tan head.  Aroma is somewhat boozy, vanilla, oak, chocolate.  This smells really good.  The kentucky bourbon notes really shine.  Creamy medium mouthfeel.  Flavors tickle my tastebuds.  This brew has a great bourbon taste upfront, mixes with the chocolate, vanilla and oak meld, with more chocolate, then finishes really smooth.  Bourbon lingers a bit.  I love this!","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"
