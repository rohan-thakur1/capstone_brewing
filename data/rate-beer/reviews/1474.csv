1474,"2017-03-01",4.5,"Kulsort, rolig og ufiltreret Imperial Porter med minimal og flygtig mocca-farvet skumtop på 3 mm. Svinder hurtigt til kant og overflade. 
Fine noter af amerikansk whiskey spreder sig om bordet og rammer næsen. Dernæst lette noter af kaffe, frugt-ditto á la hindbær samt hårdt ristet malt. Fin aroma, men ikke så kraftig som ventet. 
Dejlig bittersød smag med noter af mørk chokolade, kaffe, whiskey (Jack Daniels) og egetræ fra lagringen. Let syrlig og bitter afslutning i et vel balanceret bryg. 
Tydelig alkolhol efter ""aftemperering"", men ganske elegant samt lang eftersmag. 
Lækker blød mundfølelse. Brygget er let karboneret, konsistensen er cremet, og kroppen fyldig og rund. Afslutningen er, som nævnt, bittersød og lang. 
Overall: Elegant kraftig Porter, som bør parres med dessert én dag. Lidt sødere end jeg huskede den, men elegant integreret fadlagrings indtryk.

 Kolor:  Ciemnobrązowy, klarowny z delikatnymi przebłyskami u nasady trunku. 
 Piana:  Ciemnokremowa, niska, szybko opada do krążka.
Drobne pęcherzyki powietrza budują grubą oponkę. Przy przechyleniu kielicha na jego krawędziach malują się umiarkowane wzorki. 
 Zapach:  Po nosie uderza konkretna beczkowa wanilia, dębowa beczka, drewno.
Nuty whiskey wychodzą wyraźnie przed szereg. W tle jest słodki karmel, lekkie toffi i mnóstwo czekolady. 
 Smak:  W smaku beczka, intensywna, trwała.
Konkretny kopniak między nogi od nut mokrego drewna, dębiny, lekkiej wanillii.
Po przełknięciu czuć potęgę ciemnych owoców. Na pierwszy plan wybija się wiśnia, kwaskowata, soczysta. Równoważy ją po chwili nieco słodsza czereśnia.
Dalej odrobina karmelu, toffi i niskie posmaki czekoladowe. Tego składnika mi tutaj najbardziej brakuje.
Alkohol jest bardzo wyraźny, mocny. Drażni w gardle i w podniebieniu. Z pewnością to jeden z tych elementów, który wymaga gruntownej poprawy. Goryczka jest także dość wyraźna, stanowi połączenie nut owocowych i alkoholowych.
Tekstura nienaganna, gęsta, zbita.
Wysokie wysycenie potęguje uczucie zapychania. Po przełknięciu czuć musowanie na języku. 
 Wysycenie:  Wysokie. Stanowczo zbyt wysokie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Jest to Limitowana Edycja piwa bazowego Natt leżakowana w beczkach po whiskey Jack Daniels.

Zacznijmy od dobrych stron trunku.
Przede wszystkim beczka, beczka i jeszcze raz beczka.
Zaraz po zrzuceniu firmowej czapeczki aromat bezsprzecznie alarmuje z jaka beczka mamy do czynienia. 
Jest mnóstwo nut whiskey, dębiny, wanilii, drewna.
Jest też fajna słodka kontra w postaci karmelu i toffi.
W smaku mamy także sporo nut beczkowych, odrobina tylko słodyczy i minimum czekolady.
Jeden z podstawowych elementów Imperial Porteru gdzieś zaginął.
Przechodząc do negatywnych cech tego piwa. Alkohol na tym poziomie jest absolutnie nie do zaakceptowania. Tym bardziej dla piwa z tak wysokimi notami i Top20 Imperial Porters.
Alkohol drażni, szczypie, wyraźnie wychodzi przed szereg.
Kolejnym mankamentem jest wysokie wysycenie, które w mig sprawia, ze piwo staje się zapychające.
No cóż wysokie miejsce na RB, niczego nie gwarantuje.
Tak czy inaczej - piwo potencjał do leżakowania ma.
Zakopcie je na dnie swoich piwniczek i opiszcie wrażenia za rok, czy dwa.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

1474,"2016-10-29",4.2,"Csodás dán imperial porter, valahogyan már előzetesen sejthető volt, hogy versenyre kel majd amerikai vetélytársaival. A Jack Daniels hordókkal kötött barátsága miatt nyilvánvalóan nem indult behozhatatlan hátránnyal, legyen tehát bármennyire is felkapott manapság a hordóérlelés mutatványa, jómagam nem bánnám, ha soha nem csengene le ez a fajta hóbort a sörfőzők részéről. Így tehát alkalmam volt újfent megtapasztalni, milyenek is a vaníliakrémes, kókuszreszelékes aromák egy sörben, melyek alól csak egy vékonyka marcipános foszlány szűrődik ki, amolyan imperial porteresen, az egész illatkompozíció elegáns, nem túl hivalkodó, kecses jegyekből áll azonban össze, bár visszafogottnak a legkevésbé sem lenne értelme nevezni az aromakölteményt. Ez a rész kipipálva, innen már nagy meglepetés nem is érhet bennünket, legalábbis a kellemetlenebb fajtából, s bár az ízjegyek remekül továbbfonják a megkezdett szálakat, az előző fázist mégsem szárnyalják túl. A műfaj vonatkozásában közepestől valamivel súlyosabbnak nevezhető szurokfekete teste feszes, intenzív kortyokból tevődik össze, az ázott hordós, háncsos, faleveles, whisky-s elemek vehemensen fortyognak benne, az alkohol csípős ostorcsapásai terelik egybe azokat, hogy egy mandulás, enyhén füstös, faleveles-komlós lenyomatot, majd elismerő csettintéseket hagyjanak maguk után.","HUNGARY","adster"

Inky black and headless aside a tannish ring on the meniscus. Deeply nutty is the nose and brimming with notes of Madeira, cola soda, stewed rhubarb, vanillin, cellar must, fatty biltong, marzipan and nougat. Lighter than expected on the palate. Well attenuated. The alcohol restrained to a light warmth in the finish. Nutty, oaken with a fruity, vinous sweetness to the front. Chocolate and charred wood, marzipan and a spicy, peppery prickle to the tail hinting at the bourbon barreling. A sourness draws on the saliva glands but it is balanced and harmonious with hints of vanilla and sweet berries. Plenty of malt character but it is the ageing that is key here. Wonderful depth, the aroma playing straight into the taste really gripping the olfactories. I loved this one. Really wish I had tried it fresh with another sample to compare.

The light-brown head is tiny, short-lived and doesnt leave much lacing. Sweet, roasted and strong aroma of dark caramel, dark chocolate, well integrated whiskey (yup, this is definitely not peaty Scotch whisky), with pleasant notes of vanilla and dark dried fruits in the back. Delicious and strong flavour of huge amounts of dark chocolate, dark caramel, gentle un-peated whiskey. Also some coffee, extremely well integrated alcohol, and faint hints of apricot kernels. Moderate sweet taste with a moderate bitterness in the long finish. The body isnt as full as Id expected from a beer with this high ABV. The texture is oily and the carbonation is very, very soft, too close to flat for my liking. Still, a wonderful brew, although maybe not worth the 240 NOK I payed for this one.

1474,"2012-11-06",4.2,"In short: A big thick delicious rich chocolate-vanilla cookies with barrels superbly integrated.  Excellent.
How: Bottle 500ml at Cardinal, Stavanger Norway 
The look: A small light-beige head making a nice contrast over the pitch black body
In long: Nose is rather soft for the style and size of this beer, the aroma includes vanilla, chocolate, pastry and some whisky.  Thankfully the usual annoying perfumy character of the Jack Daniels wasnt present in the aroma, it smelled like good whisky barrels.  Taste has a rich maltiness, big thick silky luscious blackened malts, fresh bakery vanilla cookies, chocolate cake icing, moderate whisky presence, some wood.  Barrels are superbly integrated here.  Rich full body with just the right amount of carbonation.  Quite surprised that I much preferred this version over the regular Natt.  Overall sensation of a classy beer, one of the best Norwegian beer Ive ever had.  The price tag was a bit stiff but I was very curious about this top-rated beer.
