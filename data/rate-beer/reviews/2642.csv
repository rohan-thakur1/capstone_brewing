2642,"2014-01-18",3.1,"Pale yellow body, with slightly cloudy haze, medium white head. Aromas are some fruits, malts, and wheat, some dough. Palate is medium soft, a bit bit thin but mouthful. Taste is mild, some wheat and malts. Finish is short and mild. Some fruity notes are present. Overall typical Kristall Weizen, most of the flavour are gone and tastes as mild Märzen with slightly thicker body and wheat tastes. Still good and quaffable, tough.","Berlin, GERMANY","edpeg"

2642,"2012-02-05",3.0,"Crystal clear and golden yellow. Much CO2 rises, it is very pearly. The smell is fruity, hoppy, very fresh. Starts also very fresh and fruity, with good hops in the background. The finish is something more yeasty and slightly grainy, but the entire rest of the course to the finish remains dominant fruity. Surprisingly good Kristallweizen","Merzkirchen, RLP, GERMANY","Grima"
2642,"2011-01-29",2.8,"Golden with a rocky head.  The aroma is vague fruitiness with appley notes.  Dry, fizzy and then it gets cloying sweet.  Lots of banana late.  Clean.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

2642,"2010-05-24",2.6,"(bottle, nowadays just HL Kristall Weizen, the old “Haalgeist” labelling is obviously obsolete) Slightly hazy, pale golden colour with a big foamy white head. Slightly sweet and sourish fruity nose with a touch of citrus, cobwebs and Muscat. Slightly sweet and quite sour flavour, light to medium bodied with a rather calm carbonation. Moderately wheaty, citrus-fruity taste with shy herbal and tart notes; moderately sour wheaty and mildly tart finish. 24.V.10","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"

2642,"2008-02-15",2.7,"The bottle looks good, the beer in the glass also. The beer tastes not bad, but not really like a kristallweizen - much too dry and malty and too less fruity. Nevertheless a drinkable beer!","GERMANY","kappldav123"
