Pours a deep red with a small head. 

The aroma is very rich, caramelly, sort of herbal with lots of vanilla. Its got some bourbon to it, but not in an overwhelming way, just a nice pleasant way thats woven well with the other elements. 

The flavor is all that real neat vanilla, cooked fruit, & toffee sort of thing. Its got some cherry like fruitiness, some wood, and some bourbon... but again like the aroma the barrel is more complimentary here than dominant.

Slightly hazy dark amber bordering on brown color with a decent sized off white head that quickly dissipates to a ring on the top. Huge aromas of caramel and brown sugar soaked bourbon, with bits of dark fruit like cherries plums raisins and figs. The flavor is sweet but packs a lots of bourbon and alcohol to counter. Brown sugar and caramel with a solid bit of bourbon and hints of vanilla, oak, and dark fruits. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation, and a sweet almost syrupy sharp alcoholic mouthfeel. This beer smells fantastic, and tastes pretty good too, although at 12.5% it does have some rough alcohol edges.

T: Caramel and citrus hops are there on the first sip and start to meld with smooth bourbon and oaky vanilla that comes on the finish.

M: Full bodied, but not chewy or heavy. Incredibly smooth with a spot on medium level carbonation and a nice barrel sweetness on the finish.

3052,"2012-03-01",2.8,"From notes.  First reviewed 2/9/2011.  Served on tap in a snifter at the brewpub.

This pours a murky brown color, much darker than regular Behemoth. Molasses brown in the middle, walnut brown at the edges, with a creamy tan head that quickly recedes to a ring, leaving just a bit of lace.

This is surprising, I mostly just get bourbon in the nose. Some oak, vanilla, and maybe some general dark fruit. All of the caramel malt and hoppy aroma has gone away.

Bourbon soaked all the way through the flavor, it almost drowns everything else out. Some caramel sweetness up front, followed by some dark fruits, oak, and vanilla that add a little bit of depth, but there is no hop presence. The bourbon just rolls over anything that would be left underneath. The finish is lightly sweet and heavy on the Woodford Reserve.

This is full bodied for sure. The creaminess gives the feeling the body is crushing the carbonation. Quite sticky. It has a harsh boozy feel in the throat and a pleasant alcohol warming in the stomach. The juiciness from the original is gone. It has more of a flat, somewhat dry bourbon feel.

One and done, definitely. I like barrel aged beers as much or more than the next guy, but this was just too much bourbon for me. It definitely brought down an otherwise good beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Location: Three Floyds Brewing Co. Parking Lot
Serving: Draught sample shared by NachlamSie and tronraner.  Thanks guys!
Tasting Notes
Aroma: Lots of bourbon and a healthy amount of sweet caramel malt underneath and some citrus hoppiness peaking around the edges (but its mostly sweet bourbon).
Appearance: Dark amber with a small ivory head.
Flavor: Lots of deep malt and citrus hops.  Quite intense with a subtle complexity as well.  Lots of flavors can be found throughout:  orange, pine, and lemon hops; caramel, brown sugar, and toasted malts; some vanilla and even a bit of trailing char/smoky quality...  The alcohol content is definitely noticeable, but it isnt offensive or astringent.  It tastes more like a well-blended bourbon and beer composition rather than being a harsh alcoholic flavor.
Palate: Nearly full and somewhat sticky.  Quite nice and works well for this beer.
Overall: Another unbelievable Three Floyds brew!  Unfortunately, like the Barrel-Aged Dark Lord, this one is only available at the brewpub, but the line to get it isnt quite as long!","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"
3052,"2007-05-05",4.2,"So yeah, this is bourbony. Aroma was filled with it, some brown sugar or molasses in the nose as well. The flavour is again bourbony. Almost overpowering but the other flavour do make an appearance. Still some hops in there but not much, lots of body on this one and its sticky as all hell. Super sweet with some roast notes in there.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"
3052,"2007-05-05",4.1,"On tap at 3 Floyds - Pours dark reddish-brown with no head.  The oak is readily apparent in the bourbon infused nose with some sweet malt and hops in the background.  The flavor has lots of bourbon, ample hops, roast malt, oak, and a little dark fruit.  Full bodied and intense, it still goes down pretty smoothly, especially for 12.5% abv.   This is a very enjoyable barley wine, but I think it could be even better if the bourbon wasnt quite so overwhelming.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"
3052,"2007-05-02",4.1,"On tap at the brewpub the night before Dark Lord.  Upon entering FFF for the first time ever, I was pleased to learn that this was on tap.  I enjoyed this alongside of a very nice pizza that some of the C-bus crew shared.  Heaven...

The aroma was mostly bourbon, but had definite amounts of brown sugar and roasted malt.  The body was as deep brown as brown can be with some red highlights when held to light.  Very little head.  Full and clean palate-- I was suprised that this wasnt more ""syrupy"".  Lots of bourbon, brown sugar, and malt in the flavor--lots of depth and character.Most impressive was the fact that it wasnt nearly as hot as expected.  This is much more tame that regular behemoth.  Very nicely done.","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"
3052,"2007-05-02",4.2,"Draught split with Tronraner during my Dark Lord excursion. Pours a dark cola brown/red and is only slightly heady. I know that 3F is famous for their use of intense hops, but this is still hoppier than I was expecting given the fact that its a barley wine and it is also barrel aged. It is a bright aroma indeed, but not intense and with a tasteful level of vanilla. Full pineapple and pine tickle my olfactory sense with hints of lemon, caramel. Yes, the oak presence is delicate. Palate is thick with a cornucopia of caramel, lemon, green tea, pine. This is one of the most tastefully subtle uses of barrel aging, maybe the original beer being so intense helped that fact. I was a huge fan of this one, moreso than anyone else around me that was drinking it, but its a fantastic brew IMHO.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
3052,"2007-05-01",3.8,"Draught. Pours cloudy amber with beige head. The aroma is dense, very caramelly with some citrus hops and some wood. Sticky hop flavor and lots of caramel are the first thing to hit the palate, with some pine and lemon. The bourbon grows toward the finish, but without getting too crazy. The alcohol is pretty noticeable, though. There is a pleasant toastiness throughout, and a lingering smoky aftertaste.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"
3052,"2007-04-30",4.1,"On tap at 3 floyds. Poured a dark brown with no head really at all. Aroma was very rich. chocolate, toffee, caramel, bourbon. Flavor was really rich and creamy. A little harsh overall with the alcohol but the hops had mellowed a lot in a year. Great beer.","columbus, Ohio, USA","bgburdman9"
3052,"2007-04-30",4.2,"On tap.   Pours deep brown ruby color almost devoid of any head.   Aroma is bourbon, oak, sweet malts, dried fruits.   Flavor is huge wallop of bourbon, vanilla, oak, sweet caramel malts, mild hops, alcohol.   Palate is full bodied, sticky, resinous, finishes sweet with a slight alcohol burn.   Velvety smooth, puts a huge grin on your face!   Fantastic stuff.   Much of the hops is knocked down a few notches either by age or the bourbon.   Awesome!","Ohio, USA","ogglethorp"
3052,"2007-04-30",3.7,"Pours a deep brown color with no head.  Aroma is malty, woody vanilla, some hops, and bourbon.  Flavor is bourbon, woody notes, some bitter hops, and a slight alcohol burn.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","shp555"
3052,"2007-04-29",4.4,"On tap the night before DLD.  Outstandingly well balanced.  a hint of bourbon and a little woody as well.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Zinnamon"
3052,"2007-04-29",4.2,"On tap at FFF at dark lord day.Heavy bourbon and lots of sweet malt stand out in the aroma.Pours a very dark brown with almost no head,Dark fruits and lots of bourbon/alcohol completely dominate the flavor.Full mouthfeel with a lot of alcohol in the finish.","Lancaster, Ohio, USA","spector"
3052,"2007-04-29",5.0,"UPDATED: MAY 2, 2007 On tap at Three Floyds.
I let it sit on the bar for a while to let it warm up a bit.  Smell is incredible.  Think a very nice bourbon whiskey smell complimenting a very refined, well melded barleywine.  Taste is absolutely amazing.  This is one to sip all day.  Every sip was velvety smooth and better than the last.  This barleywine has transformed into a incredible beer while in the barrel.  I could not get enough of this beer.  The guys at Three Floyds have taken barrel aging to the highest level.
Very glad I had the chance to drink this.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AllAboutStout"
3052,"2007-04-29",3.7,"On tap @ Three Floyds: Pours a dark brown with an off white head. Aroma, bourbon, oak, caramel, and a slight earthiness to it, quite a bit of alcohol. Flavor, caramel, some bitterness to it, but it had faded a lot. It was still pretty hot, And I thought it could have used a bit more time to mellow, but it was alright.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
3052,"2007-04-29",4.2,"Another awesome beer by the guys at Three Floyds!  Enjoyed several times over during the DLD festivities.  Lots and Lots of bourbon in the nose, no carbonation at all, and a dark muddled red  brown in color.  The flavors were great including of course some alcohol, caramel, sugars, oak and wood.  A huge beer for sure that could be an after dinner sipper for an hour or two just to finish one glass...but very enjoyable!","Green, Ohio, USA","LeopoldStoch"
3052,"2007-04-29",4.2,"On tap at Three Floyds 4/27/07 - Pours mahogony without much head.  Aromas of bourbon, caramel, toffee, cherry, and slight remnants of the hops that were once there.  Flavor was surprisingly malty bourbon, caramel, toffee, cherry, oak, and even some vanilla.  Big body but a smooth sipper.  Some alcohol burn on the finish.","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"
3052,"2007-04-27",4.0,"On tap at FFF Brewpub,  Pours a deep dark brown with amber hues and a very small creamy off white head.  Aroma was up front bourbon, oaky woodiness, vanilla, dark fruits, some caramel and cardboard.  Flavor had tons of vanilla, oak and bourbon.  Sticky molasses, toasted malts, coffee and cardboard.  This one was a sipper.  When we asked our server they told us this was the 2006 version that was aged in bourbon.  I have yet to have the regular Behemoth but from what I heard it is a big hoppy barley wine so I was surprised with how much the hops had mellowed out and how up front the bourbon was on this one.  Really debating as to if this one was too much bourbon, or if the bourbon did this one well. I guess once I have the regular version Ill be able to make a better call on how the BA did for this beer. At this point the one thing I know for sure is tha the bourbon is all over this like white on rice.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
3052,"2007-02-06",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2009 fobab06, from memory, appearance was dark amber with no head. huge bourbon fills the whole goose island restraunt and tasting rooms with this beer. clearly overdone. very hot and unpleasant. im not getting any of the qualities i loved about the non-BA version in this thing. why did they leave it in the barrel for so long? perhaps a hop bomb like behemoth isnt meant for a bourbon barrel, why not just french/american oak. dont get me wrong i love BA beers but i dont want the bourbon to take over the beer and it clearly does in this case. this was undrinkable to me.2.4. 

1/24/09, on tap at the brewery. pours hazy amber with creamy biege head. very aromatic, bourbon, vanilla, wood, dried dark fruits, citrus and pine. flavors are initally sweet wth caramel and dark fruit notes while the alcohol dries the palate leaving wonderful notes of bourbon, vanilla, tobacco, and citrus. this is surprising very drinkable and one of the best bourbon barleywines made.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
3052,"2007-01-20",3.9,"Big bourbon nose...which could go either way here.   The golden oily pour is still the same as the non-BA version.  This has a very big oak and bourbon profile initially...later comes the hop bite, alcohol burm amd caramel notes.   I like this version even better than the non-BA...maybe in spite of the fact that its wooden characteristics are rather overdone.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
3052,"2007-01-13",2.6,"Snifter at the brewpub. Brown in color with no head. Smells of bourbon whiskey and not much else. Flavor is just like the aroma, dominated by bourbon. Although drinking these BA beers is giving me a whiskey tooth, I do not enjoy the beer due to the mask of the bourbon. Whats the sense of making a world class beer and then having bourbon overtake all of the aromas and flavors?","New Lenox, Illinois, USA","HopsOrDie"
3052,"2007-01-06",4.2,"Draft goblet at 3Fs. Hmm... deep brown-black in color. A thin head with little lacing. Intoxicating bourbon smell. A nice, thick bourbon taste that demands to be taken in small sips. Deep roasted, but without roasty astringence, Brings up hints of root beer and Jaegermeister, too. I loves me BAs.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
3052,"2007-01-06",4.3,"This was awesome. BA BEHEMOTH on tap CHEERS! Smooth as silk and very tasty warm finish and very well done.Now on tap at FFF!","Kissimmee, Florida, USA","railcat1"
3052,"2006-12-22",3.9,"Sampled at the FOBAB 2006.  Pours dark copper with a thin head.  Bourbon notes compete with toffee and caramel sweetness.  Finishes warm and a tad boozy.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ElBorracho"
3052,"2006-12-13",4.1,"@FoBAB 06.  Black pour with Boubony nose.  Flavor was intense.  I love the Behemoth and I thought the aging added complexity bordering on overpowering.  Still great.","Munster, Indiana, USA","TPaliga"
3052,"2006-11-26",3.6,"FoBAB 2006: Muddy brown with a small head. The nose is heavy bourbon, smoke, vanilla, chocolate, grassy, plum, prune, and oak. The taste starts fruity and boozy with a smoky malt background. The finish displays some wood notes along with pepper and vanilla bean. The feel is quite warming and lush yet there is some bite and finished surprisingly dry. Not bad but I preferred the base Behemoth much more, just too much barrel in this one.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
3052,"2006-11-11",4.2,"#907On tap at the 4th anual Festival of Wood and barrel Aged Beer festival at GI Wriglyville Nov 4th, 2006.Hazy reddish brown, no head, thin tan rim of brownish foam. Nose is faint buit there is mostly alcohol vapors and broubon with lots of sourness with some sweet sugars. Now at this point I was pretty dissapointed. One of the things that I love about the Behemouth is that killer action packed nose but the BA edition was too weak for me. But then I had it later, and let it sit for a bit and warm up. The nose really came out, lots of mellow oak and pepper hops with malts. Better than I first had. Pretty good.","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SubstanceT"
3052,"2006-11-07",3.8,"sampled at barrel-aged brewfest.  no head.  how is this blonde?  dark toffe/caramel.  so dark i cant tell if its oqaque or translucent.  aroma is bourbon and massive caramel.  taste is front-loaded alcohol.  short flavor profile gives way to bourbon deep in aftertaste.  somewhat watered-down (maybe since i had utopias right before it)","chicago, Illinois, USA","sersdf"
3052,"2006-11-07",4.6,"Sampled at FoBAB.  The color of this was strikingly darker having picked up the barrels bourbon or tannins during the aging.  A very slight ring of a head dissipated quickly with an aroma that was strong.  The beer picked up a slight tang that was an interesting play on the dried fruit and vanilla overtones that are so prevalent in many of these beers.  Much rounder and less bitter/acidic than the younger, non-ba Behemoth.  A very fine mutation of this fine brew.","Palos Heights, Illinois, USA","EddieG"
3052,"2006-11-06",3.6,"Rating #1100.  On tap at FoBAB 4.  Poured a murky deep brown with just a loose ring of beige head... seemed more than a touch darker than the regular Behemoth.  Nose was powerful, with the bourbon really taking over... wonderful base of caramel, pumpernickel bread, vanilla, nuttiness, and dried berries was in there, but suppressed.  The flavor also had more than its fair share of bourbon (albeit a tasty blend)... the base brew was more skewed toward the rich fruits and darker bread.. with vanilla, oak chips, molasses, grapefuit and spicy hops emerging as this aired out.  The finish was sticky and warm, sporting rich dark sugars.  The hop component lost a step since it was put in the barrel.  Solid, but picked up a bit too much bourbon character.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3052,"2006-11-06",3.7,"On tap:  Aroma of caramel, banana bread, vanilla, bourbon, and a touch of grapefruit hops.  Dark reddish-brown with a small off-white ring for a head.  Lots of caramel and vanilla up front with a hint of banana bread and grapefruit hops.  Huge boozey and bourbon finish.  I really like the flavors of the base beer, but the finish was a tad too hot with too much bourbon.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3052,"2006-11-06",4.3,"A lot of folk that I talked to at FoBAB thought that this was too strong on the Bourbon side, but I just found it to be a bit of a distraction to the nose.  Beneath that was the sweetness of malt, nuts, and lighter dried fruits.  The Bourbon seems like a base upon which to bulid a complex flavor, blending the liquor with fruits both dried and juicy, sweet nuts, vanilla, a suggestion of tamed hops, and oak.  The finish is sticky, sweet, and warming.  Very nice indeed.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/events-detail.asp?eve of Barrel Aged Beers, Chicago, IL 11/04/2006<font size=-1>","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
3052,"2006-11-06",4.5,"FoBAB 2006. The surprise beer of the day, and what a joy it was to sample it. Although Goose Islands Brandywine was impressive, this was just a bit better. Wonderful looking mahogany pour with hazelnut and honey on the nose, leading into a complex flavor profile ranging from dates to pecans to dried cherries. Nice vanilla and toasty oak finish to leave one salivating until the next sip. It struck me that this one has been sitting for awhile, because the hops were much tamer than I expected. Well done.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
3052,"2006-11-06",4.8,"Much darker than its non-barreled batch, with a chestnut-caramel hue.  Murky, not muddy, just mystical.  A tan galaxy swirls on top of it.  Sweet plum juice and brandied figs delve deeply into the glass. Aromatic figgy pudding with concord crème brulee take turns with rhubarb left soggy and baking for hours. Thick, boozy, flavorful beauty. Mulberry glazes Christmas cut out cookies. Thick rhubarb is stuck with concord fig filling and a black cherry saturated graham cracker base. Low and behold the booze that ignites the throat with an equally thrilling, fiery amarillo hop-like presence. The booze actually smoothes out the base beer for thorough complexity. Sticky palate and the epitome of winter warmers. Perhaps the biggest barleywine mouth feel Ive ever known. Black cherries get seduced by toasted coconuts and balsa batter while blackened boysenberry juice briefly glazes over rhubarb and gets slightly licked by flame. Mince meat, Disarenno and brandy plum butter ease in with the smooth black currant on toasted grahams on the way out. Splendid.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
