Örülök, hogy végül mégiscsak lett, mert így azt is nyugtázhattam, hogy pár nagyvad után milyen jóleső érzés tud lenni egy-egy szimplán szolid főzet elkortyolgatása. Ennek az italnak is egyszerűségében rejlik ugyanis az ereje, a mindig örömteli élményt nyújtó rágógumis, élesztős, gyógynövényes felhőcskékben gesztenyebarna testére simuló krémes, tojáshéj színű habja fölött; majd a bársonyosan sima, mégis élénk, kerekded szerkezetbe ágyazott, tipikusan belga, diós és aszalt fügés, datolyás, kekszes és medvecukros színezetű ízjegyeiben.

579,"2014-07-27",3.4,"330 ml bottle bought at Gorgeous Wine & Cigar in Yuen Long.
Looks: Cloudy hazy amber brown colour with thin trace of yeast sediments; Half-finger head and off- white foam which fades in 40 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with notable slight carbonation.

Aroma: Slightly fragrant amber malt, with light roastyness, light banana, vanilla, caramel, molasses, Bel yeast and light phenolics.

Taste: Medium sweet malt, with light roastyness, very strong caramel, thick molasses, very light alcohol, hint of dark fruits, Bel yeast, lime, moderate bitter hops and sharp grass.

Body: Medium. Quite thick and slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Good amber maltyness with just enough roasty taste. Caramel dominates, really good molasses and hidden booze for loveable sweetness, dark fruit ester is very low but tastable. Yeasty with bits of spiciness. Simple but subtle.

Hoppiness: No aroma; Lime, sharp grass and light spice in taste. Bitterness is quite notable for a Dubbel for an abrupt, well-balanced bitter-sweet finish.

After Taste: Slightly dry. Malty, roasty and hoppy to mouth.

Comments: As a supposedly top Dubbel, this one is a bit simple, somewhat empty, with too few esters and taste varieties. Yet its well-malted and roasted, with almost all other tastes are well amplified. Solid, but cant beat my favorite Chimay Red and Westmalle Dubbel.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

579,"2013-01-17",3.7,"Cloudy, somewhere in between amber and burgundy with a beige head. Wonderful nose of honey, sweetness, red fruits, a bit of alcohol and slightly sour. 
The taste is pretty aggressive, also because of the strong carbonation, a mix of sour, a solid bitterness that would put quite a few stouts to shame, quite alcoholic and something grapefruit-like (bitterness with a sour touch at first), some caramel underneath it all.
Aftertaste: some alcoholic warmth and quite a bit of bitterness remain, some malts which didnt come through initially; the aftertaste is a bit lighter (watery would be too harsh a word) than some of its Dubbel peers. Still this reminds me of the better beers in its style and I would have loved it even more if it was a bit less bitter and if the sweetness of the nose would be reflected in the taste.","All over Belgium, BELGIUM","Noctilucus"

Aromas of raisin, apple, pear, toast, caramel, pepper, clove, bread, earth, grass, hay, floral, and yeast spiciness.  Very nice aromas with good strength, balance, and complexity.  Taste of raisin, apple, toast, caramel, brown sugar, dark bread, pepper, clove, grass, hay, earth, light nuttiness, and yeast spiciness.  Lingering notes of light and dark fruits, toast, caramel, brown sugar, dark bread, pepper, clove, and earthy spiciness on the finish for a good bit.  Very nice flavor balance with a good amount of complexity; solid malt backbone; and no cloying flavors after the finish.  Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a lightly slick, foamy, and fairly prickly mouthfeel that is nice.  Alcohol is extremely well hidden with almost zero warming noticed after the finish.  Overall this is an excellent Belgian strong dark ale.

3.5 A: Moderate to well hazed medium brown color. Two full fingers fo frothy tan head. Retention is good, but very little lacing is left.

3.0 S: Light roastiness, light toastiness, light floral. Fruitiness mainly in the form of plum and date, but also some raisin and fig. Mild malty sweetness. A little bit of nondescript spice from the yeast. Decent and pleasant, but no better than average.

3.0 T: Like the nose, the taste is mild and lacking potency. Light toastiness, hints of caramel, and a slight biscuity flavor. Fruits mentioned in the nose. Neither sweet, nor dry. Mild peppery spiciness from yeast. 

4.0 M: Lighter body. Pleasant, spritzy carbonation with a lot of creaminess. Easily the best aspect of the brew. Super smooth.

2.5 D: Its an easy drinking beer, but this is through and through a beginners Belgian. Not much else to say. Light in flavor and aroma, without depth or complexity. The 2.5 here is used mainly to bring down the overall, which I think should be close to a 3.0.

579,"2008-09-13",4.2,"(04 bottle) Pours dark amber with a beige head that slowly fades throughout consumption.  An initial aroma of dried strawberries greets the nose, but is soon replaced by that familiar Dupont yeast which imparts just a subtle hint of funk to this dubbel.  There is also an earthiness and spice to the smell, while an undercurrent of chocolate and dark fruits keeps reminding you that you’re drinking a dubbel.  Further warming reveals more bread and earthy characteristics, with more funk emerging later.  When cold, the flavor is lightly vinous upfront, with a little caramel as well.  These light flavors become more bold and sweet, with a now very strong vinous character emerging.  Slightly tart blueberry and plum also appear and add another dimension of complexity.  The finish of this beer is filled with distinct flavors.  It begins with quick bursts of fruit (strawberry, plum, and berries), then switches to a lingering bready yeast, peppery spice, and then lightly bitter hops dry and lengthen the finish for many minutes after drinking.  The mouthfeel is medium, very smooth, and the alcohol is unnoticeable.

$6.99 at Steves Wine and More in Madison.  This was recommended and sounded interesting.  At the price my expectations were not that great which is good - this beer is solid is all aspects but mostly average as a whole.  There is very little to set it apart from any other standard dubbel.
Aroma / Appearance - A two finger generously foamy head cascaded down the sides of the glass before the bronze colored main liquid began to appear.  Lively carbonation kept things busy at all times.  Apples, oak and a rich chocolate somehow combined to form an almost underwhelming nose.  It sounds much better than it actually was even with the hay scent providing a base.
Flavor / Palate - Cherries, peach and chocolate mousse open the session.  A base of roasted malts is a solid foundation on which everything is built.  A hint of wheat and oakiness offset the mild hoppiness present in later sips.  On the whole it hits all the right notes but somehow I still found it a bit disappointing.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Generously hopped, more so than in most of their beers.  Body is full and silky with a typical lively Belgian carbonation.  Something about the silky body gives the impression that the beer vanishes away very quickly from the mouth.  Far from my favourite Dupont this is nonetheless a wonderful beer.

Fruit flavors lend to an overlying tartness.  Finishes with a pear taste, and then dries out immensely due to that classic Dupont yeast.

Wow. Yet another world class beer from this amazing little Belgian brewery. Moinette Brune is as the label suggests, a perfect beer have as an aperitif, or to match with a hearty meal. Indeed pair this one with marinated, grilled, and barbecued meats, or a classic Belgian dish such as carbonade flamande, or mussels steamed in this very beer. It would also make a delicious desert beer, and would go great with NY style cheese cake.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
579,"2006-01-08",3.2,"Pours a murky dark brown under a lasting yellowish cover.  Aroma of sour black cherries accentuated by white grapes a touch of marzipan and alcohol.  Maybe hints of banana too.  Unfortunately, the flavour is seriously one-sided due to overuse of sugar adjunct.  Dark malt is apparent in front of moderate, woody bitterness and a sour, dry alcohol.  Really not that complex or dynamic in flavour.  Light to medium body with a little residual sweetness and alcohol warming.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

It has the yeast notes, and some residual sugar of a dubbel, but seems more spicy and zesty.  Light apples futher confuse things, though I do seem to recall some light banana esters.

First sip reveals a definite tart sourness, almost lactic. This is quickly followed by a emerging sweetness of malt, figs, caramel and cherries. Mid-palate seems to reveal some watery thiness, although the hops surely make their statement in the snappy, pleasantly bitter finish. Not a lot of complexity, but has some class.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

Pours a hazy amber to light brown color, and is crowned by a prodigious light brown head.  As the beer warms up it becomes brilliantly clear and a rich amber color.  Aromas of plums, raisins, brown sugar, and a bit of herbal spiciness are all found in the nose.  Lightly sweet taste up front leads to a sharp herbal note in the finish that is characteristic of the Dupont beers.  There is a solid malty sweet component here that reminds me of brown sugar.  The sharp, spicy yeast notes meld quite well with the rich malty caramel notes.  This beer is fairly light on the palate, though not as light as a typical pale Saison.  Also because of the malt character this is much more fruity than the pale versions, there are notes of raisin, plum, and a hint of rich fig character.  This is quite tasty.  It really softens up as it warms, the brown sugar & fruit notes really start to come to the fore.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Expanisve, yet creamy, carbonation. Light spritz. Starts peppery and well-carbonated teamed with mineral and peach skins. Trace of plump fruit acidity and vague yeast astringency in the center are softened by delicate esters and muted flower tones. Finishes on the dry side with plump peach notes and a chalky yeast backbone amid a blend of coarse hop bitterness, white grapes, and melon. Peach and lightly sweet malt remnants. Yeast addition imparts more dryness while accentuating the pepper. Much like a Dubbel crossed with the mustiness/tartness of an Oud Bruin.

579,"2004-04-23",3.9,"2002.  Rusting copper with a thick, fluffy eggshell-colored head.  The aroma is sweet and quite malty with emphasis on the caramel, fresh dough, oranges, apples, cherries, plum, toasted bread, chocolate, fresh hops and light, spicy alcohol.  The palate is soft but lacks some of the texture necessary to be world-class.  The flavors are nice, but perhaps a touch too sweet.  The fruit dominates but is backed up by the lightly toasted malts, spicy alcohol and bitter, hop finish.  Honestly, I expected a little more from DuPont, as they are one of my favorite breweries.  Actually, I hope more for a Loterbol Bruin.  Either way, I could have done far worse.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

Slightly spicy hoppiness in the first sip leading to a rush of sourness thanks to open fermentation and some pretty amazing little bacteria. Really over the top sourness. Too much for me but this could be someone elses cup of tea. The beer is still young and I bet will develop some intense flavors as it ages.
