The nose was roasted, but otherwise, somewhat subtle, with hints of smoke & char, mocha notes, and creamy maltiness. The body was medium to full, with some perky effervescence for a Stout, moderate caramel sweetness, low roasted & earthy bitterness, and a pleasant creaminess to the texture.

Had this on my want list on Beer Advocate and was excited to get to try it on my first trip to the area. Decided that I was going to have two of the three big boozy beers at WOB (3 Floyds Moloko and Clown Shoes Billionaire), only missing out on Dark Horses Plead the 5th. Had high hopes as Im a big fan of the style.

Poured a pitch black color with 3-to-4 fingers of khaki tan, rocky head. Excellent lacing. Good retention. (Sight - 4.50)

Smelled toffee, roasty malts, caramel, mocha, chocolate milk, vanilla and Mud Slide. (Smell - 4.00)

Tasted roasty malts, mocha, white chocolate, Mud Slide, slight smoky fire, toasted toffee, chocolate milk, a touch of cocoa and roasty nuts. (Taste - 4.00)

Full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, roasty finish. (Feel - 4.25)

Just a very nice milk stout. Would have it again and would like to try the barrel-aged version. (Overall - 4.00)

Suave and mid-creamy mouthfeel, well-rounded due to the oats. None to sweet, very well-balanced between dark chocolate, crema and light coffee notes with a very disctinct woody acidity projected onto the palate with a lively prickle.

623,"2014-01-22",4.0,"22oz bomber poured into a stemmed snifter. A combination of vanilla extract, milk chocolate, and cookie dough bring to mind chocolate chip cookies on the nose. A deeper smell brings forth a the lactose sugar, a little bit of nuttiness (pecans?), and some berry scents (blackberry and raspberry come to mind). Theres also some distinct molasses or brown sugar aromas that stand aside from the cookie combination previously noted. It has a soapy / watery-jello tan head which recedes down after not too long leaving a couple of puffs atop a deep, dark, opaque brown. It doesnt really leave any lacing to speak of. Sweet malt is the primary taste - both roasted and creamy malts - but its mellow and pleasant. Initially, when its still a bit cool, roasted nut and woody notes hit the tongue first, but as it warms up, those flavors fade and its replaced with a smooth, creamy caramel and milk chocolate (kinda like a Rolo), and finishes with a pinch of cinnamon spice, maybe some molasses, and some brown sugar.

623,"2013-02-26",3.6,"UPDATED: NOV 22, 2013 Updated 11/22/2013: Nearly black body sports swirls of brown lace and some mild head on the surface.  Sticks to the sides of my glass, leaving behind a translucent film as its calling card. 

Aroma of deeply roasted malt, coffee, bittersweet bakers chocolate, and hints of cinnamon too.  Taste is full-bore milk stout with the lactose strutting its stuff like a Bee Gees music video.  Tilts to the sweeter side of the spectrum, but not by much: the balance here is easy to appreciate. 

Smooth, chewy, viscous body clearly outshines the Samuel Smiths Chocolate Stout my co-worker is drinking next to me.  Im a big fan of the style, and this is one I look forward to every year.

The nose is full of notes of milk chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla, and faint espresso.

Rich creamy mouthfeel. Palate-coating. Subtle carbonation. Fantastic balance with the sweetness coming through with hints of vanilla, sweet milk chocolate, and finishes with a great nutty aftertaste. This is an absolute gulper. The alcohol, though well-hidden in the flavor reveals itself after a few gulps. Be careful: this drinks like a tall glass of chocolate milk.

623,"2012-02-28",3.4,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/23/2010.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip.

Moloko has a mahogany walnut color with tints of sienna at the edge of the glass. A small tan head rests precariously on top of the beer, winding down to a thin ring. A little bit of lace forms and disappears with the swirl of the my glass.

The aroma is full of milk chocolate, roasted barley, a little bit of espresso, and a touch of booze. Overall the aroma is a little bit on the light side.

Roasted malt and espresso start strong and transition to a milk chocolate flavor. This is actually somewhat mellow, with more focus on the milk aspect and not a ton of hops blowing me away. A little alcohol bites me in the middle. Pine and just a touch of grapefruit hops just before the finish turns sweet again.

Creamy, with tight, medium carbonation. Lightly sticky and a lighter body than I would have guessed.

The aroma was wonderfully heavy of some burnt dark malts and a strong leathery yeast with notes of dark chocolate, dark roasted coffee, molasses and a hint of dark fruit.

The taste was moderately sweet with a hint of dark chocolate and molasses at first then it became extremely malty and moderately bitter with a nice creamy coffee finish. The flavor lasted a very long time after the swallow letting one relish the bitter chocolate coffee flavor.

Pours a dark black/brown with a small caramel colored head. Leaves come nice lacing.

Smell is really sweet, almost like a chocolate stout but with less cocoa flavor. Also has the roasted malt scent. Maybe even some vanilla in there.

Taste is mega sweet and delicious. More so than the other milkstouts I have had, it isnt as creamy as some but it really feels and tastes like a decadent dessert. Very chocolatey, sugary, and carmally, decadence. No too sweet, not too heavy either, a really well produced beer.

This is about as drinkable as it gets for a stout and it is a great beer to cap the night off with.

In long: A whole lot of sweetness, way too much vanilla, annoying fruit juice concentrate (grapes mainly), a coconut touch, very lactic/milky, a lot of molasses and some toffee.

Thick molasses dominates the nose, with some tootsie-roll chocolate, dulce de leche (thats appropriate)... really good, creamy chocolate milk. This is interesting stuff. Really not sure what I think of it. Im so used to Impys that it seems a bit dilute, but its certainly flavorful. The mouthfeel is silky smooth, but lacks the carbonation to keep it from feeling flat. Just a bit sour... but its the odd ""this is a bit off"" sour, not a crisp, tart sour. I realize its just lactose sugars, but I cant get my mind off the idea that theres been milk sitting in here for months, and its sort of weirding me out. Crazy brew to try, and Ill certainly give anything from FFF a shot - but I probably wouldnt seek out this style again.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

623,"2009-03-02",3.2,"My Bottom Line:
This super-sweet Milk Stout offers loads of vanilla, milk chocolate and coconut flavors for a creamy pint of dessert not for the faint of tongue.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam tops the brown-tinged black.
-A certain fruitiness is apparent in the nose, akin to maraschino cherries.
-The light carbonation makes the sweetness overshoot its purpose and diminishes drinkability.
-The finish does offer some earthy, almost vegetal hop notes, but the prevalent sweetness tends to wash over them pretty quickly.

623,"2009-01-04",3.1,"This is a first for me; this is really the first Three Floyd’s beer that I would characterize as disappointing. Mouthfeel was troubling...it seemed almost greasy or oily in my mouth, and the flavor seemed a dichotomy...like a mix of too-sweet sweetness and some nice milky creamy flavor.

It poured black with not very much off-white head. Aroma was intensely roasty and definitely predicted the sweetness that I described above in the flavor. Mouthfeel was a bit strange.

OK...I found this beer interesting, but compared to my first experiences with Gumallhead, Alpha King, and Dreadnought, which were downright eurphoric...well let’s just say it wasn’t the same.

623,"2008-12-27",4.2,"22oz bottle. Pours a very thick and dark black body with a very small, dark brown, fizzy head that dissipates into nothing and leaves no real lacing. Aroma is a nice combination of sweet dark and tart cherries with a mild coffee roastiness. Clearly milky and chocolatey. Some nuttiness, but the almost marshmellow-like aroma is pretty cool. It grows into a much fuller aroma as it warms. Flavor is almost like drinking a chocolate milk with a dry roast backing. Very creamy and smooth. Very milk chocolatey and blended well with the coffee taste. A hazelnut mellowness to it as well. Finishes with a little sour prune taste and lingers with a sweet, oatmeal chocolate and mild coffee aftertaste. Palate is full bodied, very creamy, and very chewy. Overall, this is a damn good sweet stout. It has a very nice oatmeal feel to it and a lot of nutty chocolate that balances real well with the mild coffee beans. I like this a lot and enjoy it more and more as it warms up.

Chilled, it plays like a weak milk stout, but as it warms, it becomes much more like drinking chocolate milk. Aroma and flavor are dominated by the lactose, with notes of hops in each as well. Roasted barley, hazelnut, and coffee also make themselves known in the flavor, to varying degrees as the brew warms. Nice notes of candy sugar as well. Very nice.","Indiana, USA","StFun"

623,"2008-12-20",3.2,"A fairly solid pour into my 25cl tulip glass yields a two-finger thick, darkly browned, tan colored head that sits on top of a very black colored beer.  The darkness is complete as this beer does not pass light even when held up directly to the light.  The aroma is dominated by roasted grain character; aromas of French roast coffee beans, well toasted barley husk, blackened whole grain bread, crushed well browned (not quite burnt) crackers and some sweet, burnt caramel notes.  Though amply roast focused, the nose keeps from being overly harsh.

This is quite sweet, the lactose really comes through quite strongly; it is a simple sweetness that is a touch too strong for the rest of the beer.  Underneath the sweetness is an ample roasted malt character that provides both a touch of burnt acidity as well as a roast-grain bitterness.  There is quite a bit of toasted, browned grain character to this beer as well, with notes of browned whole grain crackers and an almost burnt bread crust note.  Concentrated, yet smooth, flavors of black coffee are found towards the finish.  The body somehow seems lighter than it really is, I think this is a product of the lactose influence somehow as this beer does have some viscosity to it.

Somehow this beer is a bit simplistic.  I expect a greater malt complexity in both the flavor and the aroma; in the case of the flavor that lactose seems to drown out a lot of notes that might otherwise be noticeable.  Not bad, but a bit bland.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

It’s been a while since I’ve tried any Three Floyds beers since they are hard to come by here in Ohio.  While on a trip to Kentucky I managed to locate this and don’t regret it at all.  This is one of the best sweet stouts that I have tried and if it were available locally might go into my regular rotation.

Aroma / Appearance - The deep sandy head decorated a black body along with beautiful strands of creamy lacing.  Hazel, black coffee, skim milk, vanilla, and a mellow hoppiness formed almost a perfect blend.

Flavor / Palate - Creamy caramel, black coffee, and plum hit the tongue on the first sip.  Next comes a taste that reminds me of Starbucks’ sea salt and caramel hot chocolate.  The milk stands out most in the transition; by the finish it is a shadow on the throat.  I wish I had another bottle - hopefully this is a regular release in the future.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

After two days of mostly pretty good beers something finally hit a homerun and reminded me why I love chasing beer so much. This beer was defined by its milkiness, and is the first milk stout I’ve had that really shows the milk decently at all. Usually they are just very lactic and kind of gross, but this one has a perfect, sweet, creamy milkiness, like whole milk, carrying forward a lovely chocolately stout flavor.

Smell is a combination of malted milk balls and coffee. Milk chocolate sweetness is present from the outset with a good roasted malt character as well.

The sweetness really takes over in the taste with huge milk chocolate and lactose sugars dominating throughout. There is a bit of roasted malt backbone before a slight bitterness that lingers through the finish, probably from the hops.

Mouthfeel is silky smooth and creamy with low carbonation. Creates a dessert-like sweetness on the palate.

If their intention was to create a drinkable summer stout, Id say they accomplished that.  I think this is a pretty good sweet stout, but not as good as the Bells or Rogue offerings.

623,"2008-10-11",3.7,"I’m afraid imperial stouts have spoiled me, because after drinking them regularly for years, other stouts seem weak and thin by comparison.  It’s not fair, really.  This beer is, by far, superior to so many others.  Yet, compared to the potency of imperials, it seems almost meek in comparison.  I often avoid sweet and dry stouts, knowing my own tendencies, but an offering from FFF isn’t something to be taken lightly, so this was an easy buy.  It all starts off well enough, with that almost black color and dark brown head that I adore, though the head doesn’t last long enough for top marks.  Nose tends to be dominated by the chocolate notes, but there’s a definitive roasty quality, as well.  Flavor is well balanced between roast, chocolate, and coffee flavors, with lingering alcohol notes as it warms.  Mouthfeel is medium, with some creamy and oily characteristics.  As far as the style goes, this is quite good.  Hell, as far as BEER goes, this is quite good.

623,"2008-09-13",3.2,"UPDATED: AUG 30, 2009 22oz bottle. The last time I had this was the first day the FFF brewpub opened and I recalled liking it a lot. I just missed this on cask at the maproom so I thought Id pay the ridiculous amount of $8 for a milk stout.  I came home and had the place to myself a bit and thought itd been a while since Ive seen ""A Clockwork Orange"" and this was the geekiest time as ever. So I opened this bottled labeled ""Moloko Milk Stout"" with probably my favorite FFF label to get me sharp and ready for the old ultra-violence. This poured rather heavy, black with tan head that didnt last long yet eventually formed again nicely. I thought it was a bit strange that no one at the Kovoko milk bar was drinking anything this dark but maybe this was a new brand or something, it smelled of lactose, chocolate, roast, and vanilla. tasted like sweet chocolate, lactose, mild roast, caramel, with a semi-sweet finish. a pretty heavy body with silky mouth feel. even though i felt a triple IPA would have worked a bit better with the film but hell i cant complain this was Moloko milk (stout)! 3.6.

Wonderfully effervescent pour shows a rich layering effect with a large head that penetrates deep in to the glass and eventually settles out about two-fingers high.  Body is inky black-brown with a dark tan head.  Retention is medium-strong and there is light lacing left on the glass.  Head is dense and creamy.The aroma is rich, sweet and creamy.  Heavy, sweetened cream adorns the juicy drops of bakers chocolate, while plentiful lactic acid provides a balancing tartness/dryness.  Some minimal prunes and even a hint of some lighly charred malts make a showing, but are warded off by the milky/creamy sweetness.  The aroma is luxurious, rich, and strong, but so soft and comforting on the nose, with only the light lactic notes and easygoing roast adding any hard notes.The lactose and lactic acid noted in the nose pales in comparison to its appearance in the flavor.  A deep milk chocolate, with plenty of bitter black chocolate opens up initially, coating the palate, and is quickly subsumed by rich, milky cream notes that keep the palate wet and heavy, as dark fruits, brought on by roasted malts playing with the lactic notes, enliven things.  Some bare, graham cracker-like dryness asserts itself, briefly, and is then replaced by a crescendo of sugary, lactose sweetness on the finish.  Immensely creamy, chewy and rich on the finish.  Low carbonation allows the sweet, rich, milky flavors to shine, but cuts it just enough so as not to get cloying.  It is, certainly, very sweet, but the fantastic execution of the lactose addition is so well-done and, in my opinion, not overdone.  So many milk stouts purport this flavor and then it is barely noticeable amid the hops and roast.  I could see this being a bit too much when fresh, but after 8 months, it has evened out well.  No alcohol noted in aroma or flavor, nor is yeast apparent.  Hops have all but disappeared as well.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Nose is milky with nice chocolate notes and smooth, minimal roasty bitterness in the nose. Taste is big and sweet, minimal roasted bitterness here either. I could drink this one all night. No tartness to be found and super smooth. Damn, this shit is classic. 8-4-9-5-17

11/20/5 - Deep brown with a creamy head. Definite roast with chocolate and coffee undertones. Quite sweet. One of my favorites that Ive had from them. Big body. Awesome. 7-4-9-4-15","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"

623,"2005-11-20",3.9,"Black with quickly dissipating head.  This stout is very rich, The flavor is big and assertive with chocolate, coffee, and cream, finish is not quite as long as most three floyds products rendering this chewy full bodied brew very smooth and drinkable though not as thirst quenching as their pale products.  Would make a great desert!","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SkyinBrian"
623,"2005-11-18",3.9,"Black body, tan head.  Lactose and roast malt in the aroma with green viney hops. Not much sweetness.  The flavor brings in a medium-strength chocolate malt and lactose sweetness along with roast and the same hops.  A excellent sweet stout - sublime roast notes.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
623,"2005-11-17",3.4,"Sampled from a growler at the monthly meeting of the Champaign-Urbana beer club. This is my fourth experience with this beer, and each time I walk away less than impressed. Its a solid stout, but its fairly thin of palate and not very aromatic. There some milk and cream which is nice, its not over the top on the hops, but Im left wanting more complexity and, ultimately, more flavor. Whats there is some milk chocolate and some roastedness, but Im really pushing it to find much more. I like FFF, just not as blown away by this as others seems to be.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
623,"2005-11-15",3.7,"Semi-bitter flavor.  Dark color.  Smooth milky texture.  Caramel covered nut flavor.  Sort of a cold coffee taste but not overpowering.  Some sweet hints too.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
623,"2005-11-15",4.3,"Oh, Mama!  Thanks, Brian, for sharing this growler.  Stuff pours jet black like 10W40 with a thick and creamy brown head.  Decorates the glass with beautiful lace.  Stick your nose in there and smell butter toffee, hazelnuts, chocolate, cherries, roasted coffee, hops (it is 3F), and more.  Let the orchestra play their symphony on your olfactory senses.  Sip and feel the smoothness, the minimal carbonation, the creaminess.  The flavor blends everything to a basic of coffee with thick, rich cream and shots of chocolate and hazelnuts.  Yum.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"

Smells of some butter toffee sweet hints of milk chocolate and light bourbon.. mmm.. plaate is a bit small.  flavor is milk chocolate, the chocolate malt from the ice cream malts some light hop bitter.. dont know what kind some other roasted flavors and nice lactose.. Really really good stuff","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
623,"2005-11-14",3.6,"Tap at brewpub. Very creamy and thick tan head. Dark stout body. Roasted chocolate ""malt"" and roasted sour milk and grain aroma. Thick, bourbon coated charcoaled wood taste. Some fruitiness in the background and also some slight hops in there. Pretty good... for me, a little too much roasty sour milk.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
623,"2005-11-12",4.2,"This beer boasts a dark black color (it must have been the lighting at Three Floyds Brewpub, but I think I saw a blue tint to this beer).  It is disappointing that such a brilliantly colored beer has a mere glaze of a head and leaves only a smidgen of lacing in its wake.   A nice hearty combination of coffee, chocolate, and toffee rise to meet the scent glands.  This moderately thick stout spreads evenly through the mouth offering a sweet coffee taste that has a hint of smoke lingering in the background.  The throat is not disappointed as the sweet coffee taste lingers and lingers and lingers.","Champaign, Illinois, USA","RooftopRogue"
623,"2005-11-06",3.5,"Draught, new brewpub (November 2005):  Black. (Though at the end of the glass it became transparent and muddy golden-red brown.)  A gray-brown film forms after the foamy, big bubbled head fallslactic fruit and berry aroma with cherries, blueberries and sweet raisins.  While light coffee rests in the background, cherry alcohol and black raspberry bitterness clings to the palate.  Chlorophyll-coffee like flavours fill the finish with a lingering creamy dark chocolate.  Another unique take on a non-hop crazy styleI like these new experiments, though this one could have used a bit less of the sweetness and a bit more hop kick","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
623,"2005-11-06",3.8,"On tap at the brewpub.  This is about as black as black can be.  Had a nice 1/2 inch rocky bubbly head.  A lot of roasts and molasses in the aroma and taste.  Nice and creamy going down.  Finishes a little sweet but a slight alcohol burn kicks in and balances it out.  This is a very nice stout, hell Im putting it on my ice cream.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ElBorracho"

Aroma is dry, roasty and chocolatey with a touch of buttered popcorn.  Nicely balanced and lightly hoppy with plenty of sweet chocolatey malt and lactose.  An enjoyable stout that I hope they someday bottle.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
623,"2005-08-24",4.3,"GTM. Rich, stoutish aroma with some chocolate milk notes. Black body, fully opaque, huge light tan head. First impression is of coconut, but is more sweet milk. This brew was named after the ""moloko milk"" in A Clockwork Orange and quite honestly, this tastes like the sweet, alcoholic milk they referred to in the book. Outstanding. I wish theyd bottle this. Not much bite; smooth. Surprisingly high alcohol for the taste. Well done guys.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
623,"2005-08-20",3.7,"Thanks Duane for the hand bottled sample. Black body with no light showing through. The aroma is caramel, coffee, chocolate and a little hidden vanilla.

623,"2005-08-15",4.1,"Tap @ GTMW.  Moderate viscosity and midnight brown in color with a few streaks of tan for the head.  Toned down aroma, with some rich chocolate, caramel currents in fudge brownies and dark chocolate fudge.  Flavor begins with a lovely creamy milk chocolate persona that Id have any day of the week to stow away in a milk carton and drink with my lunch.  Rich chocolate morsels, like spooning out the cookie batter and putting more in your mouth than on the cookie sheet.  Some brown sugar and maple oatmea.  Medium bodied.  This flavor is bitching.  A delectable stout.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
623,"2005-08-12",3.3,"This beers got a great aroma and appearance.  Black with grey head.  The first few sips are nice and sweet.  Then it just tastes really chalky and its quite unappealing.  The mouth fell is a little grainy like there are some bits in it.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"
623,"2005-08-10",3.9,"On tap at the brewery.  Milk chocolate and espresso aroma.  Pitch black with fine brown head.  Tastes like a chocolate malt.  Very full bodied and sticky.    Reminds me of a Irish Car Bomb.  If you are not familiar, get a pint of stout, and drop a shot of Irish Cream in it, the chug.  The difference is that I didnt chug this, and it was much more enjoyable.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"

623,"2005-07-25",3.8,"Rating #333... Im only half evil.
Black and oily with no head. Aromas were fairly weak, with only some roasted coffee and a hint of raisin. Moderately sweet in flavor to start with huge coffee bitterness coming through right after. More raisin and prune after that. Syrupy and oily to create a slick mouthfeel. Would pair well with Beethovens Ninth.

Very smooth and yes, very milky is my impression, like that chewing gum made with milk sugar thats supposed to be good for your teeth. Dark as coffee, and just a bit of a ring from the foam around the edge of the plastic cup at 3Floyds. Taste is of heavy cream and mocha, definitely with the smoothness of oatmeal at work, too (Nic confirms theres also oatmeal in this moloko, me droogies). Despite the preponderance of chocolate and coffee roast malts, theres not a rough note note to be found anywhere in this drink, until you notice the alcohol creeping up on you!","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

The taste starts quite twangy with a hit of bitters. There is a nutty and roasted overtones followed by an ending of earthy yeast notes and coffee.
