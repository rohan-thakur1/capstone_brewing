3960,"2012-04-14",2.9,"Bottle.  Pours a lightly hazed gold.  Big bright ginger on the nose, very fresh.  Mango and old fruit juice follows it with hints of papaya.  Sweet mango, a touch of ginger, and a bit of warm rice.  Long slow finish with rice and more sweet ripe mango.  The ginger fades away on the end.  Still nice enough, but not really as a sake.  More like a wine cooler or something youd drink 5 of while floating around in the pool.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
3960,"2010-10-24",2.6,"(187ml bottle thanks to Mora2000) cloudy green, no legs at all. Nose of vegetables, ginger, pear, mango and funk. Taste of spicy ginger, soft carbonation, pears. Not great.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"

3960,"2010-10-19",2.5,"(187ml bottle, courtesy of Mora2000)  Pours a hazy yellow body.  Aroma of mango, some citrus, and ginger.  Flavor of mango and light ginger with fizzy mouthfeel.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
3960,"2010-10-16",1.9,"thanks to mora2000 for completing all the sake styles for me with this one.  hazy yellow with no legs.  mango. thin on the palate, more mango, hint of ginger in the finish.","Dallas, Texas, USA","mar"
3960,"2010-10-11",2.4,"187 ml bottle. Pours a very light yellow color. The aroma and flavor are dominated by mango. I get a little bit of ginger in the flavor, but the mango overpowers everything. Not bad, but it tastes more like a mango-flavored wine cooler.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
3960,"2010-02-18",2.4,"18.7 cL clear bottle. Pours a cloudy orange with a small white head. Aroma is mango and mild citrusy. Sweet mango flavoured and mild rice base. Sweet mango finish. Sweet mango juice impression.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
3960,"2009-12-02",2.1,"clearish orangish color. smells of very sticky honey, apples and some mango.  Flavor is sweet.  kool aid with a kick.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
3960,"2009-10-01",2.1,"Bottle: Pours just like the picture shows, with a little fizz. The nose is more orange and mango than ginger. Theres a light muskiness which could be the sake or the contrasting ginger extract. Still a semi-sweet and fruity flavor with a light fizz in the mouthfeel that makes you feel like youre drinking one of those fruity fizzy wine drinks from the 80s (Bartles and James? Do those still exist?) but in ""asian"" format. Probably a great 1st time sake drink for someone who detests real alcoholic beverages.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3960,"2009-09-09",2.4,"Bottle naughtily shared by frumptydumpty. Fucking asshole.  I am not going to thank you for bringing this to my beer tasting.  I hope your beers in Denmark taste better than this shit, cuntbag.  Go fuck yourself.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
3960,"2009-09-03",2.5,"Thanks to Ryan for this.  All this needs is a ruffie or a little GHB and a high school party.","raleigh, North Carolina, USA","ucusty"
3960,"2009-05-10",3.2,"UPDATED: MAY 19, 2009 bottle from Central Market.  Pours a cloudy, light yellow with only thin, tiny white bubbles around the edge.  Nose is of ginger, mango, peach and bug spray.  Taste is very fruity - mango, peach and some ginger.  Decent taste.  Mouthfeel was sweet and carbonated.  Not bad.","Land of Sugar, Texas, USA","MaltOMeal"
3960,"2009-05-10",2.2,"6.3 oz. bottle from Trader Joes, Downers Grove. Yeah, a chance to tick just one more sake category. Color is of a light, cloudy ginger ale. Pours a bit of mango smell with edges of ginger, as expected. Not really a ""sake"" smell, but its nice, so Ill tip that to a ""5."" Fizziness suggests this was carbonated. Taste, though, I cant say is good. Seems nice and fruity, but more like a mango-ginger wine cooler would be. I just dont see Japanese businessmen enjoying this with dinner. I just see schoolkids swigging this like an energy drink.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
3960,"2008-07-02",1.5,"Pours a slightly hazed peach color with a short fused head that rests to nonexistent. Aromas of jolly Ranch sweetness and only mild bamboo. Light with good carbonation. This tastes like orange Jolly Ranchers with a twist of tropical mango. A disturbing blend to include some cheap Junmai. The sake pulls forward making this unenjoyable. It’s just not a good marriage people. Theres some acidity to linger on the palate. Not my cup of tea.","Last Supper, Arizona, USA","GreatLibations"
3960,"2008-05-07",2.9,"Sent a photo to be uploaded. Pours a hazy, orange tinted yellow. Earthy aroma with tropical fruit notes: mango, lemon, ginger and some mildew. Sharp tiny bubbles, and a real (not artificial) ginger taste with sweet mango and then a rotten banana finish.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
