4143,"2017-01-14",4.5,"Lots of vanilla and mild oak notes compliment a sweet apricot flavor. Peach is a little masked and the bourbon comes through a lot more when served at room temperature rather than just a mild chill. Superstition makes yet another fantastic mead!","Oceanside, California, USA","Floydster"
4143,"2016-12-30",4.0,"Sample from hackobock, thanks! Clear golden straw color leaving some nice legs. Aroma is of honey, peaches, apricots, oak spiciness (toasted oak?) and hints of vanilla. Taste is sweet but never cloying with fun acidity from the fruits, honey, oak spiciness and hints of vanilla. Medium body. Still. A bit oily. Mouth coating finish. Well balanced with a fun mix of fruits and oak features. Tasty!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
4143,"2016-12-30",4.1,"Very pretty pour. its a sample from Tommy via Jacob? Looks like a straw yellow, great clarity. Aroma is honey, papaya, vanilla. Wow. Not cloying, actually a sharp acidity from the apricot at the finish. Its hard to tell what fruit dominates here but Id guess apricot does. The vanilla is actually really faint and hardly pushing through. Oak is minimal and no smokiness or tannic overtones. Well done!","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
4143,"2016-11-11",4.6,"A fine example of a modern barrel mead, with hints of oak, bourbon and amazing fruit to balance","Colorado, USA","USA_MasterHop"
4143,"2016-11-11",4.6,"Smell is honey fruit, and some vanilla. Taste is lemon tart, and sweet with fruit characters of peach and apricot. Vanilla beans finish with alcohol. Medium body.","Bowness-on-Windermere, Cumbria, ENGLAND","NICKBAINS"
4143,"2016-11-11",4.6,"Full, rich and deep bodied honey delight. The alcohol was balanced with the lovely woody characters from the barrels. Peach & apricot came to the front with a delicate raison character","Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","Walter_Lewis"
4143,"2016-11-11",4.7,"Blew me a way. The wood and bourbon were dominant but mellowed with the fruit/ apricot and left an smooth lingering depth with the alcohol","WALES","Linesbrewco"

4143,"2016-09-30",3.8,"Bottle courtesy of Hackobock. Pours clear pale golden leaving some subtle legs on the glass with a swirl. Smell is fruity, floral and tiny herbal with honey, bees wax, peaches, plums, vanilla, dried flowers, minerals and hints of alcohol. Taste is sweet, heavy fruity, slightly floral and slightly herbal. Mouthfeel is soft, round, tiny oily, very tiny astringent, boozy and medium to full bodied. Finish is sweet and very tiny bitter with floral honey, peaches, apricots, plum jam, vanilla, minerals, lemon peal and alcohol. Mellow compared to Heras Orchard. Not bitter at all. Balanced and tasty. Bit heavy on the alcohol burn. Overall quite great!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"
4143,"2016-07-26",4.2,"On tap at Superstition, pours a clear blonde. Aroma brings out tons of the stone fruits, especially the dried apricots, with a touch of vanilla and some oak. Flavour is hugely fruity, with loads of peaches and apricot upfront, accentuated beautifully by vanilla. Not getting much oak. The honey is there but subdued by the fruit. Barely any booze showing. Wonderful.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
4143,"2016-07-01",4.0,"Dont get any of the fruit in the aroma. There is definitely some indeterminable fruit flavors in the body. A bit sweeter than some of the other light-hued meads here.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
4143,"2016-06-01",4.4,"Nice gold pour. Loads of stone fruit, vanilla, oak, light caramel peaking through. The stone fruit and vanilla play off of each other really really well. NIce stuff indeed.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
4143,"2016-04-23",4.0,"Smell is honey, stone fruit, and faint vanilla. Taste is tangy, tart, and sweet (in that order) peach and apricot mixed with honey, vanilla beans, and a tinge of alcohol. Medium body with a bit of alcohol warmth and taste.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
