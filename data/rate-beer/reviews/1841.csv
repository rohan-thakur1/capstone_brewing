Head is small, mostly diminishing.
Body is clear dark yellow.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly hoppy (herbs), with notes of sugar / cotton candy.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

Dreadfully sugary and simple, and more boozy than youd expect, like pretty much everything HotD makes anymore. I was excited to be able to drink here all week, but one visit was more than enough...after trying the taster flight and a bottle of 2013 Matt (80% of which went down the drain at $18, fuck that!), I walked out with no interest in coming back.
