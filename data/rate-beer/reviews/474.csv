474,"2017-06-02",4.4,"Bottle from Valhallas Goat, Glasgow. Beer served in 12°C, Teku Glass. I like that idea with putting green coffee beans into bourbon barrel for 12 months instead of putting beer into barrels. Aroma is mostly dominated by good quality coffee flavor with vanilla notes. Body is thick but smooth. Taste like coffee essence, with pleasant vanilla and coconut aftertaste, slightly sour what is fine balanced with rest of flavors and sourness is well hidden in the coffee tsunami. Overall I like this version much more than the regular one, but maybe Im just not a big fan of orthodox stouts.","Glasgow, SCOTLAND","Navers"

474,"2017-04-30",3.5,"6.5%ABV.

Poured out dark brown, almost black. 38SRM.

Nose has strong coffee and woodsmoke aroma. There is that slight sour tang of woodsmoke or a freshly roasted coffee. Hint of chocolate in the nose.

Mouthfeel is carbonated and surprisingly light. Palate has roasted barley, dark rough wheat toast. Overall the palate is pretty light. The bitter flavors are light charcoal, dark roast coffee, charred wood or burnt twigs. Very smooth finish without the harshness of alcohol or the bitterness of carbonization. There is a nice mellow woody flavor as well, not obvious and very well-balanced.

Overall a pretty smooth ride, not jagged or obvious with nicely rounded flavors and relatively easy drinking.","SINGAPORE","drjoeng"
