2104,"2017-02-18",3.4,"Keg at the Three Johns - London. Pours totally clear gold with a thick, frothy white head. Strong grassy and floral hops in the nose, some citrus zest. Light sweet flavour with aggressive grassy bitterness, lemon rind, dry ple mats, hay, some grain husk. Light bodied with average carbonation. A little harsh on the finish, more strong grass, citrus rind, pale crackers. Like so many Mallinsons beers, the bitterness is just a bit of out of balance.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
2104,"2015-08-30",3.6,"Hazy amber, almost nonexistent head. Little aroma to speak of, mildly zesty I suppose. Flavour is as youd expect for a well-hopped American style pale ale, lots of citrus, some tropical fruit, pine, etc. Not complex or innovative but still right up my street.","","JohnCook101"

The taste was hop bitter with a dry finish and aftertaste. Not really my thing but it was refreshing and clean tasting, if lacking in a maltier balance sort of way.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"
2104,"2014-07-21",3.2,"Bottle from Hop Hideout, Sheffield. Hazy, straw colour. Thick, fluffy, lasting, white head. Good looking beer. Lemon. Lime. Digestive biscuit. Light, herbal, floral honey thing going on. Taste is more of the floral thing. Like eating a rose petal. Bit tinny, really. Palate is clean and lively, though. Finish is dry, and light bitter. Found this a bit odd.","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"
2104,"2013-12-13",3.5,"Bottle. Hazy gold with a white foam. Aromas are grapefruit and spritzy lemon with base biscuit. Tinned pineapple juice with yeasty and floral notes.

2104,"2012-10-23",3.6,"Bottle from Cotteridge Wines, Birmingham. Pours a beautiful yellow, with big foamy head. Smells pretty sharply grapefruity. Juicy mouthfeel, mmmmmm most pleasant. To me, yes this is hoppy (yes), but also it has a sharp edge of almost burnt, almost plastic notes to the big bitter hops. Mostly delicious, but does have that hard x-factor, and Im not sure its meant to be like that - in any case it causes me to knock a few marks off.
