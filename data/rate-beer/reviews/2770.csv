2770,"2017-06-11",3.0,"Bottle from World Market in Redwood City, CA. Aroma is light bready malts and syrups. Taste is dry bread with some metal and minor rye spices. Light German bread kind of vibes, not a big fan.","Redwood City, California, USA","tightslice"
2770,"2017-02-13",3.9,"Had this before, not sure what happened to my rating, lets try this again hoping this wont get erased.
Poured into a pilsener glass, the appearance was a ruddy burnt semi-dark orange color with a finger and a half of white foamy head. Left some nice sticky lace.
The aroma had a slight breadiness/somewhat like toast with some grassy hops and a light allspice. Some floral hops bite in for a decent balance. And then some caramel/toffee malts.
The flavor blended all of the previously mentioned flavors and then adds in a sly earthiness and subtle nuttiness. Smooth sweet bready and nutty aftertaste leading into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Good carbonation and the ABV feels good for how it comes across.
Overall, hoping this doesnt erase this time. Ratebeer is usually good about emailing me when a beer changes styles or a duplicate is found. Good thing I have backups elsewhere. Yes, I would have it again if I could find it.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

2770,"2016-12-03",3.6,"Polotmavy isnt the easiest style to track down. Maybe thats why my first experience with one felt particularly rewarding. Though it was some time past its best by date, Full Sails brew still had quite a bit of hop character. To me, the aroma was like a hybrid of hoppy pils and a rich, malty red lager. Taste was kind of like that, too. Fat malts - nutty, fruity, and toffee-like. Finish was mildly bitter with earthy, piney hops. It speaks both to its European roots and its American botanicals.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Thanks to Santa for the stubby bottle. I once again have all styles until there is another split and then I guess it will be time to chase down yet another elusive tick. This would have been nice even if it were not motivated by catching them all. A typical Full Sail beer is full of flavor without being so heavy that it wears down the palate after a single bottle.

Aroma / Appearance - A semitransparent ruby base bubbles below a strong ivory head that takes time to settle down. Melted caramel, waxy chocolate, cherry licorice, and nutty malts are a snack of Twizzlers and Twix.

Flavor / Palate - Spicy caramel perks up the tongue. A collection of anise and chocolate chips carry into a filling full bodied finish. Easy drinking for 6% ABV this release is something that I hope more breweries will experiment with. If I ever were to visit the Czech Republic trying more of these fresh would be at the top of my list.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

2770,"2014-02-08",1.9,"c/o Beer Delivery from WillRunForBeer

Aroma - was light, some spicy hop, but mostly a caramel malt.
Appearance - really blah, the body is a caramel amber, clear liquid, the head setup was really minimal. Then the little bit of head there was just utterly died. No ring, nothing at all. It quickly came to look like iced tea.
Taste - is a balance between caramel malt flavors and a somewhat spiced hop.
Palate - body is light, the texture thin, the carbonation on the palate is soft, the finish is somewhat spiced hop.

Cant say I knew anything about this brewery before hand. It is a rare style, and Im glad I got to try it, but its just really forgettable. I will say based on everything, but appearance, its a tasty session - thats as kind as I can be. One other issue I had with this is the frustrating sort of electric tape kind of plastic on the bottle. It also had its cap rivets so closely tucked into to the taper of the bottle, that it was difficult to get a grip.

2770,"2011-09-20",3.3,"11 ounce bottle from a 12 pack that was purchased yesterday at the Davis Beer Shoppe.  I find it hilarious that this beer is considered a ""Session"" at 6.2% ABV.  I also find it hilarious that this beer was on shelves more than 3 months before the holidays.  There is a sweet, malty, almost buttery aromatic character with a little metallic lager character.  Fairly herbal, not much else happening here.  Transparent copper-amber body with a creamy white head that leaves good lacing.  Attractive.  Starts a little sweet and sugary with some hints of caramel malts, before this becomes a little toasted with some cereal hints towards the middle.  Light metallic yeastiness later on, with a persistent underlying sweetness.  Slightly cloying.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
