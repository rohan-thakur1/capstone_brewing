3527,"2012-02-13",3.4,"Tasted this in The Esquire House, Glasgow (JDW) in November 2009. Cask, handpump dispense. Clear black ruby in colour with a thick tight creamy buff head. Slight hit of espresso coffee and dusty black malt in the short aroma. Thick creamy mouthfeel and decent lacing. Dark malts give robust strong flavours, with dusty black malt giving burnt toast on initial flavour. Then smokey overtones of roasted malts with black coffee and juicy overipe bramble fruit - long in intensity comes through. Dry bitter hop resins impart a strong peppery note to the aftertaste. Finish is smooth and malty with sweet treacle toffee, chocolate fondant and dry wood smoke notes. This is a complex mild, full of flavour and depth. Well recommended.","Saltcoats, SCOTLAND","tombyars"

3527,"2009-11-27",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2009 The Fleur-de-Lis, Banbury. Tar with a yellow-tan rim. Burnt toast aroma. Layered carbon and chewy dried fruit, cigar and cocoa linger, scatter of charred nuts. Big on taste, with a presence and roastiness more stout than mild in my book.
