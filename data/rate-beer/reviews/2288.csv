2288,"2016-09-18",4.3,"Bottle 375ml. Served at cellar temperature. Pours a deep, dark brown with a ruby tint and a slight haze. Head is small, dense, tanned and mostly lasting. Aroma is rich and complex; plum reduction, fig jam, caramelized dates, burnt brown sugar, rum liquor chocolates, aniseed, pudding spices and vanilla pods. Flavour smooth, complex and slightly vinous; stewed plums, overripe figs, lightly toasted sticky date loaf, tawny port, cherry liquor chocolates, burnt caramel, treacle, pudding spices, aniseed and light toasted/woody notes in the finish.

2288,"2016-04-23",3.5,"At cellar temperature and into a snifter. Brilliant, deepest cola brown with a solid head that dwindled rapidly - I blame my glass. Aroma is hard to pinpoint. My wife pointed out chocolate scented perfume and Id say that is pretty close. Chocolaty with ample pot pourri, lightly roasted coffee, vannillin, musk candi, old tawny port, marzipan and booze. Big in feel, slightly oily and viscous drowned out by the alcohol warmth. Soft to foamy in carbonation. Dark chocolate and the coffee of the nose is prominent. That weird perfume mixes in well and there is a a hint of plum coming through. A dusty chocolate malt flavour builds as does rich caramel. It drinks well but doesnt hit the heights I hoped it would. A complex nose fades a little on the palate. Likeable, approachable Quad! (12.7fl.Oz, Code 043D-2 0943, The Liquor Shed, Jandakot)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"

2288,"2016-01-22",4.2,"Poured from bottle into a snifter
 Appearance  The beer pours a deep brown mahogany color, bordering on black, with a one finger tan colored head of foam. The head has a moderate level of retention, fading to leave bits of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  A huge dark fruit aroma of plum, raisin, and fig control the vast majority of the nose. Along with these smells comes some other aromas of a sweeter candied sugar can caramel as well as some notes of yeast and spice of clove and coriander. A bit of a light boozy and banana smell is there as well, mixing with the robust dark fruit and sweet aromas to produce a very warming and inviting smell.
 Taste  The taste begins with a big, sweet dark fruit flavor of cherry, raisin, plum, and fig. This sweetness is augmented by some other sweeter tastes of candied sugar and molasses. As the taste advances the fruit flavors begin to fade a little bit while the molasses and some caramel take their place. With the exchange of the sweeter tastes, there is also some yeast and a bit of a more roasty taste that comes to the tongue. While a chunk of the dark fruit fades, the plum actually makes a comeback at the end of the taste, really amping up the plum flavor profile. This plum is accompanied by some light warming rum flavors and a little bit more candied sugar to leave on with a plum sweetened, boozy, but quite dangerously smooth and drinkable dark fruity taste to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the brew is on the average to slightly thinner and crisper for a 10.2 % abv. brew and has a carbonation level that is on the slightly lower side. For the warming sweet and boozy flavors mixed with the fruity but hearty tastes of the brew the feel really was quite nice. It had enough body to support all the flavors, all while not allowing the tastes buds to be overwhelmed by any one given flavor.
 Overall  This is one fantastic quad in my opinion!! It has tons of nice dark fruity flavor, with it all being balanced very nicely. While the biggest of the flavors that accompany the dark fruit (mainly plum) are sweet, there is a superb blend of alcohol, yeast, spice, and roast, which seems to meld everything together well and make for one approachable slow sipper. This is a very tasty brew. Well done SN!!","","Darkmagus82"

2288,"2015-08-28",4.0,"A corked and caged 12.7 oz bottle served in a St. Bernardus snifter. .Pulling the cork released almost no pressure, and the pour and thin head confirmed very low carbonation.

2288,"2015-08-24",3.8,"Bottles from Champanes, four bottles sampled over a 1 ½ year spread, 
this ale had a hazy dark brown pour that got clear as it warmed, and it gave a small thin film cover of off-white bubbles that receded to a couple of small islands and thin ring, 
it left some spots and fingers of lacing on the sides of the glass, I found no sediment in the bottle, 

this ale had aromas of date, raisin, fig and plum dark fruit with brown sugar, dark bread, faint spice and faint caramel, 
the nose had a good amount of bread and fruit sweetness, 

there were flavors of dark malt, dark bread and dark fruit, a little brown sugar, 
the finish had a touch of pepper spice with dark malt and dark fruit carrying over, 

it had a medium to full mouth feel with a bit of creamy feel, and felt like it had a soft to average carbonation, there was a little alcohol warmth on the throat, 

I think more carbonation would help the nose and flavor of this drink,

Poured into my HotD goblet.. The brew is dark dark walnut brown with only some garnet showing through down at the stem end of the glass... dark tan head rises and then drops pretty quickly.

The aromas are nice.. not as rich as many quads, but still there are plenty of dark maltiness and more fruity esters than spicy notes... fruity notes actually outweigh the malts for the most part..

Flavors are sorta traditional.. again, very fruity without the background toasty malts... the malt is there, but obliterated by the esters and residual fruits..

Body and carbonation are pretty square...

Where are the plums?? Are they the fruity culprit that dried this one out? Did they get rid of the traditional maltiness?

I notice some people complaining about an alcohol burn - I think letting this beer age [as you should with a Quad] smoothed it out because I didnt get any of that. Yes, there was some sweetness from the sugar plums, but thats what you should WANT when you are drinking a sugar plum abbey quad. I did and it was amazing. I think the biggest problem Im going to have is resisting the urge to drink more when I go back and buy a whole CASE to age for another year!

The aroma had moderate molasses, chocolate and dark candy sugar; hints of caramel; moderate earthy, dusty cobweb-like, spicy and fruity yeast; brown sugar; plum; light alcohol; dark fruit; caramelized sugar, sugar coated and caramel covered dark fruit; and, when warmer, a little funky yeast. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and lightly acidic; while the finish was heavily sweet, lightly acidic and slightly bitter. There was caramel, burnt sugar, plum, other dark fruit, molasses, spicy and fruity yeast, slightly funky yeast, a little alcohol and a little chocolate.

2288,"2014-05-18",4.0,"I usually reserve my St. Bernardus chalice, gifted to me during my only visit to Brawleys in Charlotte, NC, several years ago for special treats, of which I am hoping the Ovila Abbey Quad is one. Opens up with a light pop, as the cork is freed from the wire cage and extracted. The carbonation is light, and the beer pours very dark brown, looking like a thick cola. The smell is filled with cherry, plum, and other dark skinned fruit. There is a touch of hops upon deeper inspection of the smell. The taste has more of a brown sugar, than a dark fruit type sweetness, with sour notes becoming more noticeable mid palette, before being swept aside by the alcohol warmth. Some dark chocolate presence in the finish. If I have a fault to pick, it is the thinness of the body. It does not quite seem up to the velvet like feel of others in the style.

2288,"2014-04-08",3.9,"A color that could only be considered purple-brown. The head is proud and gelatinous, shimmying a-this way and that atop the liquid.

The aroma is puzzling: first of all, very heavy yeast. But not the kind of yeast youd think of as ""Belgian"" yeast, but more like banana and bakers dough. The luxurious head has something to do with this: Im coming back to it.....Okay Im back: the plum really starts to emerge after the head stops blocking it and it warms up a bit.

The flavor is heavy yeast: more raw dough, banana and clove. The plums come in as a VERY weak accent. Once it warms up a bit, the raisin/plum flavor starts to emerge a bit.

The feel is a thick, yeasty brew; incredibly chewy. You absolutely *have* to let this one warm up a bit. I might even recommend pouring 1/5 of the bottle at a time.

The taste was spicy and sweet at the same time; sticky sweet and spicy aftertaste, dry lingering sticky sweet finish.

A - A hard pour reveals, dark ruby/brown body, nice clarity with a finger of tan head. Beautiful beer.

S - Roasted ashy malt, smoked molasses, very spicy aroma, rich and acidic fruit comes out with grapes, cherries, tobacco, burnt candy sugar. The fruit takes on a cooked character once warmed.

T - Spicy fruit, scorched cherries, acidic grapes, theres an odd smokiness to the malt, an alcohol sharpness that cuts through the sweet malt. Finishes astringent with flat cola, spicy alcohol and charred malt.

M - Medium to full body, semi-syrupy feel, low carbonation.

This is some odd flavors going on. Definitely a unique Quad...or beer for that matter. Grapes and cherries seemed to dominate the fruit profile especially when warm. There was a burnt charred character running through the entire beer and the heavy handed alcohol seemed to disrupt rather than add to the flavors. Not my cup of tea.

Some mile bubble gum, a little meaty, and sugary flights to highlight, less but rounding soy (very faint), chocolate, and yeast. A lot of interesting, complex things going on there, especially with layers of malt. Pours something of a dark brown dark enough to be called black, with chic ruby highlights and a short light brown head. Taste is sweet, lightly bitter, very lightly tart, strongly fruity (red berry, grape, peach, and especially plum and apricot), brown sugar, very light hops but their presence is noted. Heaviest overtones are just strong prune juice, with raisins added. Thick and richly malt body is warming with hefty alcohol but smooth as silk, no burn, but enough stature to feel important. Comes in on the jammier side, well, OK, its extraordinarily jammy (and the intensity will likely be decried by detractors as Americanization), but heavy and complex, one to sip and swirl slowly, and really enjoy.

This was a very tasty and delicious quad. Thanks to tastybeer for sharing it one night. Sierra Nevada can be hit or miss but this one is definitely a winner. I would recommend grabbing one if they are still on the shelves.

Aroma / Appearance - A reddish black base sticks to the side of the glass. A thin mocha head dances on top along with long spindly legs. Plums, chocolate, and malt pair with dark fruits to give this a nice raspberry cheesecake texture.

Flavor / Palate - Dry and malty the first sip is bursting with depth. It does get boozy over time. The fruitiness and chocolate may not be as rich as a true Belgian quad. However for the low price point it does not disappoint. A case of these in the cellar would not be a waste of $35.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

2288,"2013-08-01",3.7,"A steady pour into my New Belgium tulip produces a one-finger thick, amber tinged, tan colored head. The beer is a very burnt, opaque amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, deep plum stained, concentrated amber hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells quite fruit focused with concentrated prune notes, floral plum notes, bright raisin aromatics, and just lots of dark fruit character that is quite bright. The fruitiness is accentuated by a sweet clove spiciness towards the end of the aroma.

Sweet tasting, which is backed by a drying effervescence, and a spicy finish, the beer is actually fairly dry for a beer of this strength, which is certainly a plus in a beer of this style. Ample fruit notes reminiscent of dried plums, raisins, spicy figs, and lots of caramelized fruit notes are found in this beer. The finish has a spiciness to it that starts out as clove, but has a long finish that is peppery, and perhaps even a touch of something like ginger; though the pepper notes really do seem to linger on the palate for quite some time. Deep caramelized candy sugar notes, fermented molasses, fig syrup, some soft butterscotch notes, as well as a combination of things that reminds me slightly of Dr. Pepper.

Quite nice, this really hides its alcohol quite well, and drinks way smoother than a beer of this strength should. I like the ample fruitiness that this beer has, it works quite well with the rich caramelized malt / sugar notes.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2288,"2013-07-31",4.2,"375ml bottle. Pours an opaque deep chestnut, verging on black, with a moderate beige head, which lasts well and leaves reasonable lacing. Strong prune and fig aromas mix with port, nutmeg and faint anise notes. Mild spice hops up front blend with spicy yeast notes of nutmeg and mild cloves. A strong prune flavour comes into the mid-palate, where it mixes with port and a trace of vanilla. A touch of slivovice and more spice lend warmth to the finish, and there is a lingering spicy plum aftertaste. This is a wonderfully complex and very enjoyable beer.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"

2288,"2013-07-21",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 8, 2014 (This rating is for the Vision of Sugar Plums version):   Bottle from the SN brewery in Chico. Deep garnet red with a very small light tan head. Nice chocolate aroma but with an unusual cooked vegetable component (like lima beans) that worried me. Fortunately, that did not follow strongly into the flavor and I think its a bit of hops showing through. What did come through was delicious dark chocolate, figs, plums and molasses along with a creamy vanilla. As it warmed up, it became more and more of a dessert beer. Theres a slight woodiness to it that along with that vegetal character keeps the sweetness in check. Finishes with cream and dark chocolate along with what seems like a wood barrel aging taste (but it must be something else). I noticed that there were only 2 other ratings of this and they were both in July along with me. Not sure how a winter holiday beer got pushed out to July, but Im hoping well get more for Christmas this year!Earlier Rating: 3/5/2013 Total Score: 4.212.7 oz. bottle in a 4 pack from the brewery.   Rich roasted malt and sugar aromas coming out of the bottle.   Pours a beautiful dark amber and garnet with very little carbonation and wispy but lasting light tan head.  Explodes with plum and cherry flavors, milk and dark chocolate, charred wood and biting alcohol.   Theres so much going on all at once and right away, but the balance between everything is great and the combination is delicious.  Its a bit hot with alcohol, but the sweetness surges near the end and balance returns.   Leaves with lasting sweetness and chocolate, and a light sourness and bitterness that lays on the tongue and doesnt let go.   Another stellar Ovila beer!       ***************** New notes*******************:  Found out that the Visions of Sugar Plums ale is a slight variation of Ovila Quad with Plums (SN said this on Twitter:  A few tweaks to the Ovila version, including a dryer finish.).     So, now Im doing a comparative tasting of Visions of Sugar Plums (from 2012/2013) with the 2013 and 2014 versions of the Ovila Quad with Plums.   The 2014 definitely has more carbonation and head as well as sweetness than either of the 2013 versions.  The VOSP still has a slightly woody, vegetal taste compared to the Quad as well as a more mellow flavor all around.   Both of the Quads seem to have sharper edges but the 2014 has more sweetness to balance it.    Although the VOSP has a bit more character, I think the Quad is probably the better beer.   However, Id like SN to bring both of them back for a rematch next year!","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"

Sierra Nevada Ovila Quad With Plums - 12.7 oz bottle in goblet glass. Presumably 2013 vintage..

Aroma: nice subdued malty sweetness, some hint of plum, maybe cherry...

Appearance: Pours around 35+ on SRM scale. Mostly deep sort of brown maybe a hint of red. Minimal head but enough carbonation to keep a small fizzy ring..

Taste: Wheras normal Quad has a core that is almost a subtle butterscotchy or molassesy syrup sweetness, this is a fruitier sort of sweetness. Hard to describe honestly, no citrus or even candied fruit sort of taste. More subtle, like close to a peach which makes sense I guess. Tastes like plum, basically, which is no surprise, maybe a bit vanilla. Delightful balance, very very tasty. A bit of peppery finish. 

Palate/Mouthfeel: a bit creamy but surprisingly light for 10% + abv. No alcohol burn whatever, extremely smooth. 

Overall: Fantastic. No complaints. Quad is no slouch on its own, and this really does improve upon it. Only found 1 bottle, will probably buy more on sight.

Appearance: Pours a dark burgundy body with a thin, light ecru head.

Smell: Displays a heavy dose of toastiness, as well as brown sugar. As with the taste, just a touch of chocolate. Moderate fruitiness present, as is a pungent phenolic spiciness. Takes on a spiced fruit cake quality as it warms a bit.

Taste: Deeply toasty, brown sugar-tasting maltiness given an extra drizzle of simple syrup. Fairly fruity, both from the esters to the addition of the plums. Lightly tangy. Very faint dusting of cocoa powder. Quite spicy, moreso than I recalled the original Quad being - anise, white peppercorns, coriander seed. Finishes up spicy and sweet, toasty and warming.

Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium-plus carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel. As with the standard-issue Quad, Im glad its never sickly sticky or menacingly cloying.

Overall: Quite good. I appreciate the smaller-sized portion here, allowing me to get on with my grim life. I can knock back a quad without getting knocked out for a nap.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Aroma has a roasted character, raisin bread pudding is a good descriptor, malts and dried fruit blended in a complementary way. Appearance is a dark brown-red with decent lacing and lingering residue of foam on top.  Taste is a dried fruit lineup of plums, figs & raisins, very smooth despite the high abv, chocolate(?), orange zest. The main theme I picked up is that its all really well integrated.  The wide array of roasted, citrus and dried fruit flavors work together. Palate is lively, sizzling in carbonation, medium bodied, long lasting flavor presence.

2288,"2013-04-14",3.7,"Bottled January 9, 2013.
Appearance: This is a very dark quad, appearing black in the glass with deep chestnut hues on the edges. The head is thin with poor retention, settling into a creamy tan ring.
Aroma: On the pour the aroma is of dark cherries and plums with brown sugar hints. This smells pretty nice.
Taste: Fruity and syrupy plum flavors are strong on the intro and get more intense as the sip progresses. The taste becomes a touch boozy with a medicinal quality with sweet malts underneath and with a touch of brown sugar. This is very drinkable for 10%.
Palate: Thick and syrupy with moderate carbonation.

2288,"2013-04-12",3.7,"Pours dark brown - sort of a maroon-tinted mahogany - but light enough for color to be seen throughout and the beer is transparent even in a full (small) glass. Head is thin layer of fine beige bubbles. The aroma has lots of sweet malt and dark fruit notes. Lots of raisins, prunes, plums and other fruitiness. If I didnt know there were plums added, I probably would think this is just a normal quad with particularly deep fruit notes. It smells like a raisin bread pudding. Lots of doughy, bready malt with caramel, molasses, treacle and sweet booze. Very nice spice, as well. Taste starts sweet and builds in complexity and spice. The fruit comes through with a bit of tannic bitterness. Makes me think of macerated plum skin. Most of the sweetness is caramel and other doughy, toasty malt notes. The finish is a bit boozy, but theres a lot of nice lingering flavor. The mouthfeel is fine and gentle. It does get a tad sticky as the beer warms and some of the carbonation comes out of the beer. Hard to avoid that. Still, it coats the mouth nicely and that light bitter note keeps the beer from getting cloying. Overall, Im impressed by this beer. With their fancier offerings, Sierra Nevada shows off a mastery of restraint. When it comes to adding fruit (and barrel-aging), breweries tend to go overboard. This beer uses plums to enhance its flavor, and the beer, rather than the plums, remains the star of the show.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

2288,"2013-03-19",3.8,"Pours an exceptionally dark brown color with big head that rises and falls into a thin-ish film but never really goes away. 

The aroma is richly malty, very nutty and far roastier than what Im used to in a quad... but its a very enjoyable characteristic. Some raisins and dark fruit in there as well, but this is more subdued than the malty bit. The beer is not especially sweet smelling. 

The flavor is somewhere between a huge brown ale and a quad, certainly nutty and roasty but never ""coffee, or burnt"" roasty just defiantly roasty. The grapey alcohol note is hit pretty perfectly and I cant tell if the spiciness is alcohol deriven, spice deriven or both. Either way the booziness is pretty big. The plum flavor is nice, fairly subdued but very well integrated, the level of sweetness is good... this isnt exactly a style of beer that lends its self to dryness, and this is by no means not sweet... but its a long ways from cloying or sickly. 

Despite the head retention, this is a pretty bubbly lively beer & it does the dance between heavy beer and bubbly prickly palate very well. 

Enjoyable, and unbeatable for the price.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
2288,"2013-03-19",3.6,"Poured from twelve ounce corked and caged bottle into Riedel Overture beer glass. A fresh fragrance of potpourri rushes up to the fore with heaps of dried lavender and violet, black forest cherry skins dashed with powdered sugar, and, of course, plum sauce. Head appears as a shadowy wisp of a ring that fizzles into spotty lace and a bronze metal body. Dense fruit cake fills the palate, deconstructing into dried dark stone fruit skins, gingerbread, and culminating with huge malt that settles into flavors between coffee cake and tiramisu. Thick enough consistency that coats the tongue with a velvet-rich texture. Well-balanced and one of the best entries of a Belgian style from an American brewery that Ive tasted.","Orange, California, USA","Jonathan_E"

Not sure if I poured it wrong, but Im just surprised there wasnt more to it...not as surprised when I smell it.  Huge fruit aroma, vanilla, yeast funk, and a big boozey overtone. The ABV is probably why the head was so thin. Taste is dominated by some alcohol bitterness, but lots of fig, plum/raisin, banana, sweet brown sugar.  As it warms up, it seems to get a little sweeter with some tea leaf in there too.  Pretty good but a little harsh I think.","Buffalo, New York, USA","Miked1687"

2288,"2013-02-17",3.5,"(bottle) Pours a clear dark red with a thin off-white head that retains well.  Aroma has plum written all over it, and smells exactly like a ripe Italian plum.  There are underlying scents of bread and brown sugar, but the plum is the dominant feature, which certainly isnt off-putting in any way.  No real trace of the high alcohol in the aroma.  The flavor is a big let down in comparison to the pleasant plumminess of the aroma, and it reminds me of a sugar-free jam thats been diluted in water.  The flavor and texture is very thin, weak, and it lacks the substantial heft and breadiness that are normally present within most quads.  Peppery alcohol (or is it the yeast?) leaves an obnoxious sting on the finish and interrupts what was a decent finish, as the plum does intensify somewhat mid-palate.

The aroma is mild with plum,  caramel malt, Munich malt, pale chocolate malt, banana and some band aid which thankfully disappeared after a few swirls. The flavor is like the aroma, but it doesnt quite earn tasty status.  Low bitterness.  Id like it better with a mild raisin note.  Its a good deal at $13.99 per 4 pack. Smooth and boozy with bonus banana burps.  Not a good beer to judge by having just one beer.  It became more enjoyable after 24 ounces were consumed.","chicago, Illinois, USA","Quasimodo"
2288,"2013-02-10",3.7,"From the bottle, a brownish pour and somewhat violet hue, aroma is sweet with sugary fruits.  Taste has some plums in the finish.  Pretty good.","Chandler, Arizona, USA","JPDurden24"
2288,"2013-02-09",3.8,"Bottle to snifter (shared with the Mrs.). Looks good; a fairly opaque dark brown with light beige lacing. Smells and tastes solid; candied dark fruit. Good on the palate. Good beer.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
2288,"2013-02-09",4.2,"Bottle. Pours an almost-black color with a moderate off-white head. Nose has some slight sweetness with a hint of sour and is darkly fruity. Taste has a subtle hint of roasting with other malts helping. A small bit of sweetness underlies some sour fruit notes. Amazing beer.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"
2288,"2013-02-08",4.1,"12.7 oz bottle- Dark brown pour with decent creme head. Aroma is plums but somewhat artificial in flavor, sugary,  malty.  For a 10+ ABV, no alcohol smell or flavor. The taste is plum and spices, slightly sweet. Body is good for this style. Im interested to see how this ages but very good now.","","lantaran"
2288,"2013-02-08",3.6,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2015 375 ml. corked n caged bottle- Pours a wonderful dark ruby red with a tan head that reduces to a collar and some islands. Aroma is I think sugar plums, sugary and other dark fruits, malt, really no alcohol in the aroma surprisingly. The taste is dark fruits, the plums really resonate, spices, sugary, but not really sweet. Body is full, carbonation is kind of low, which surprises me. Overall I honestly think this needs some age, it was just released, even a couple months would do it wonders I think. I believe and hope my score will go up in the months ahead, I do have three more bottles. 7-26-13 Re-rate- Honestly I am only doing this because I said I would rate it again, but I dont think my scores are going to change, 6 months later and my opinion hasnt changed, nice beer though, but it has seemed to mellow a bit.","Idaho, USA","Beerdrinker79"
