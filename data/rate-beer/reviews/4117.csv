4117,"2017-02-23",4.5,"375 ml bottle to snifter (shared with the Mrs.). Looks great; a still, translucent black cherry skin with nice legs. Smells fantastic! A robust assortment of dark berries alongside a wonderfully balanced honey backbone. Tastes like it smells with a dangerously smooth and flawless full-bodied mouthfeel. Jammy AF. Deelicious!","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
4117,"2017-02-18",4.4,"Bottle thanks to Savada. Pours a cloudy dark purple with no head. The aroma is strong berry, currant, grape, honey, booze. Thick, jammy, berry, boozy, sweet cherry, very nice.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
4117,"2017-02-15",4.4,"Bottle. Garnet/crimson pour with no head. Huge berry bouquet. Sweet honey and raspberry highlights. So smooth, so good. Great mouthfeel and body.","Florida, USA","50belair"
4117,"2017-02-15",4.2,"375 mL bottle. Deep purple body. Smells pretty boozy, but it has a strong berry aroma behind it. Cherry and currants most prominent. Tastes much less boozy, but the alcohol is still prevalent. Sweet honey immediately cut by currant acidity. Cherry kinda adds back to the sweetness. Almost dries out in the back end with the currants, but has a lingering bit of honey sweetness. Long alcoholic finish. Sweet and a little syrupy. Superb fruit flavor, as always.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
4117,"2017-02-09",4.6,"Bottle. Pours deep purple/red. Nose is deep honey and fruit. Flavor showcases the fruits so well. Wow. Every fruit is present and complement each other amazingly. Ken does it again! Wow.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

4117,"2016-12-29",4.8,"Complex and delicious. 4 different fruits blend nicely. Nose is powerful fruit with just a touch of alcohol warmth, similar fruits to Heart of Darkness but with boysenberries added. While lacking the handcrafted aspect, a great beverage in its own right.","Ohio, USA","dakingindanorf"
4117,"2016-12-29",4.7,"Another knockout mead from Schramms. Stopped by for the release a couple weeks ago and tried this on tap. Absolutely amazing. 
Just coats your mouth in fruity sunshine. Loved the cherry notes the best.","Kansas City, Kansas, USA","SarpinosBoss"
4117,"2016-12-29",4.8,"With several different fruits, this has a depth and complexity that is very welcome. Sweet and tart in the right amounts. Cannot understate how beautiful this liquid is.","","CountPrattula"
4117,"2016-12-29",4.8,"Close to perfection. All of the elements come out in this one. Great, thick mouthfeel. Cherries up front. Raspberries in the middle. Boysenberries on the back end. And if you know what a black currant tastes like, you can taste it all the way through. After the swallow, lingering flavors coat the mouth, leaving your mouth watering for more.

4117,"2016-12-29",4.7,"Tasted this in the tasting room a few weeks back, and while Cranberry will always be my favorite, this gets very close. The raspberry and cherry flavors blend perfectly, and harmonize elegantly with the aroma. Schramms has delivered another hit with ASOF and I will no doubt be seeking more of this soon.","Michigan, USA","jalford4"

4117,"2016-12-27",4.5,"Smell is heavy sweet cherry and plum and berry. Taste is like if you put a tiny splash each of Madeline, Black Agnes, and Raspberry into a small pour of The Statement. Basically the Statement taste in it is what is most prominent. Full body with a very slight alcohol taste and heat.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
4117,"2016-12-24",4.1,"From bottle @ Schramms mead day 2016. Pour is deep red/purple, aroma and flavor of light raspberry juice, heavy boysenberry, semi-sweet cherries, and jammy black currants. Finish is mostly black currants and very sweet.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Dfonorow"
4117,"2016-10-14",4.5,"Leftovers from the Anniversary Party. Pour at the Meadery. The pour is a dark garnet with some great legs of alcohol on the glass with a staining ability. The aroma is full of berries. Cherry, currant, boysenberry, and raspberry are all present with just a sweet hint of honey. The flavor is much of the same. Heavy currant and cherry with a light raspberry and a tartness from the boysenberry. The mouth feel is thick and syrupy with a honey texture and a lingeringly sweet, yet tart berry. This is awesome.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
4117,"2016-10-02",4.5,"Sampled at Schramms where it pours up with a deep clear purple body that tosses up some nice legginess. The aroma pulses with inviting berry notes. I can easily smell this from two feet away. I get current jammy heaven with a bit of a bosenberry and waxy honey at the edges. The taste is straight up rich nectar AWESOME! Its yummy jammy black currants and bosenberry and cherry. Wow jammy juicy and then mild fruity tartness towards the finish. I can sip on this for days . . .","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4117,"2016-09-18",4.5,"Tap at Schramms. Aroma is huge black currant with some cherry and raspberry underneath. Tastes incredible like every Schramms mead. Dont get much boys ever but the currant, cherry and raspberry blend so well together. Moderate to strong sweetness. Ultra smooth with the usual syrupy mouthfeel. Nice touch of alcohol in the finish. Up there with the best.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
