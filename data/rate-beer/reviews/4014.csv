4014,"2017-05-11",4.0,"Wow, a top 5 world pale ale. I am on board. Hazy yellow orange New England appearance, a lasting, messy white head on top. The aroma is great, juicy orange, mango, grapefruit rind. The flavor kills it, a real beermosa in beer, non-mosa form, but better and not for wimps. The juice is loose, but not in a scary way like if OJ had it out for you. Dry flavors of orange, pineapple, and mango. I can almost see pulp. Medium bodied and rough on the feel, but in a good way.

4014,"2017-03-03",4.2,"16 oz can. Pours a hazy and turbid golden orange color and topped by a small smooth head of off white foam that settles quickly to a thin film. The aroma is really nice and juicy showing loads of tropical fruit with notes of orange, grapefruit, mango, and stone fruit to go with the bready malts, light pine resin, and citrus hops. The flavor follows suit with the juicy orange, grapefruit, mango, peach, and passion fruit up front and are balanced out nicely by the toasted bread malts, light pine and citrus hop bitterness. There is a nice dryness to it all from the hop bitterness. Medium plus in body and incredibly smooth and easy to drink with ample carbonation that leads to a dry, bitter sweet finish with lingering notes of orange and grapefruit. This one drinks more like an IPA at this abv, but I love how dry it finishes. Really delicious stuff. Fantastic pale ale.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

Pours hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, lemon/orange peel, light pine, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, lemon/orange peel, light pine, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/grassy/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, lemon/orange rind, pine, wheat, cracker, bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately sticky/resinous, and creamy/grainy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 6.6%. Overall this is an outstanding pale ale. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. Not quite as vibrant and aromatic as some of their other beers, and more resinous/drying in the mouthfeel; but still highly enjoyable.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Aroma: Wonderful aroma that starts off tropical and citrusy, with mango and papaya, some citrus zest, very bright and fruity overall, with herbal and resiny hints, and a bit of pale malt

Appearance: Pours an unclear orange color with a frothy white head and mid-heavy lacing

Flavor: It tastes much like it smells, fruity, with a bit of sweetness, and a clean hop bitterness

Palate: Medium bodied, smooth, clean, and extremely drinkable, with a soft feel and a dry close

Overall Impression: 
This is a beautiful APA.  Great all the way through from the aroma through the flavor.  Lives up to its reputation for sure.  One of the best new things I have tried in a while, and one of the best examples of the style I can ever remember trying.  Excellent.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Mmm, very fruity on the nose with pineapple and grapefruit leading the charge. Believe it or not theres also a creme or sherbert smell to it too. Hidden in back are some earthy hops.

Those earthy hops on the nose are slightly subdued, but present nonetheless. The middle of the mouth picks up acidic orange.tangerine and grapefruit. Theres almost a flowery/potpourri taste in addition to the fruits which actually makes for a nice combo. The finish is quite bitter with a big hop presence which is unusual because that typically tends to happen up front. Im not going to be writing any complaints to Trillium about it, but Im just sayin. 

This has a light to medium body with plenty of carbonation bubbles dancing on the tongue. There are no unpleasant lingering flavors and it finishes clean with no alcohol taste.

Fort Point Pale Ale is up there with some of the best of its style. It has a nice combination of hop bitterness and citrus to make this a highly drinkable beer with just enough carbonation and hop bitterness to satisfy hop heads and causal drinkers.","","DoinkTheClown"

The plastic lime of Citra, the cat urine of Simcoe, the papaya seed and flint of Chinook and relatives. This essence translates over to the flavor, where some of these more ragged, beefy plant characters become softer tangerine, orange, and some pellet dust. Prickly and warm. I appreciate the balance of hop aroma and flavor to bitterness, but Im not particularly enjoying the coarse, grating bite of the hop characters.

4014,"2014-05-02",4.1,"750 bottle shared from MaxxDaddy, 5 days old. Very pale pour, moderately cloudy. Ridiculously fresh aroma; ripe tomato, pine, mozzarella. Mmmm. It kind of smells like pizza, in an awesome way. Dangerously Drinkable indeed, with a solid body, very dry, fresh hop and a balance way in the direction of hops. The kind of beer that will quickly make you regret tomorrow morning if you find it on tap.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

4014,"2014-04-08",3.6,"Was listed as a Pale Ale at Lord Hobo, but definitely tasted like an IPA; would have been the best Pale Ale Id ever had. Hazy gold, nice foamy white head. Big citrus and resin hop aroma, bitter citrus flavor with toasted malt and yeast notes.","Somerville, Massachusetts, USA","williamstome"
4014,"2014-04-06",4.0,"The beer pours a pale, greenish yellow with a nice, quarter fingers width head of eggshell-white bubbles. In body, the beer is clear and clean with a slight chill haze, but no visible particles and a nice lazy carbonation. On the nose, the beer is a beautiful bouquet of Citra hops. Mango and tropical fruit blend with spicy pine needles, pine resin, and a just a faint whiff of cattiness. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter, yet balanced by cracker smooth malt sweetness. Soft citric acidity snaps at the start and finish of the sip, providing nice, yet drinkable complexity. In flavor, the beer begins as lemon juice and pine, slowly unfurling into pine and tropical juice with a nice balancing cracker malt and light prickly, light pineapple flavors. The finish is a crisp burst of juicy fruit, cracker malt, and lime zest, and the aftertaste is soft and tame, ringing with bitter medicine, pine, and citrus. In the mouth, the beer feels crisp and on the light side of medium in body. Carbonation is soft, and the beer provides a nice smooth blanket for the tongue, even though it remains crisp as an overall sip. Overall, this is a great hoppy pale ale. Bitterness is definitely the dominant feature here, and the Citra hop definitely shines, making this a wonderfully balanced hoppy beer with great complexity. This is a borderline IPA, and I personally would label it as such, as the malt balance isnt quite where I like it for an APA. Overall this is a tremendously quaffable, hoppy pale ale with some great refreshing flavor. A beer to try!","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"
4014,"2014-03-28",4.3,"Growler filled at brewery and opened five days later. Pours a beautiful hazy gold, like pulpy orange juice. Aroma leaps out of the glass, super pungent, signaling that youre in for something great: lychee, mango, pine, orange, tropical-fruit explosion. Really great. Taste is pineapple, grapefruit pith, Asian pear, passionfruit, and lingering but not too pronounced bitterness. Very balanced. Clean. Creamy. Remarkable pale ale/IPA hybrid right up there with some of the styles trendsetters.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","dfroms"
4014,"2014-03-27",4.3,"Hazy golden orange color with a dense, frothy, white head. Ripe fruit aroma of grapefruit, citrus, peach, mango, and pale malt. A smidgen of sweetness rounded out by hop bitterness. Crisp mouthfeel, moderately carbed, and refreshing. Dry finish of light bitterness.","California, USA","Ataraxia"
4014,"2014-03-04",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
Lively citrus, sandy and piney hop resins make this IPA a truly compelling pint for the hophead.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sturdy head of foam laces around the cloudy pale straw.
-The coniferous hop bitterness is as intense as the aroma. This is chock-full of hop aroma, flavor AND finish. And all is brightly expressed.
-Calling this a Pale Ale is quite deceiving. This is hoppier than many IPAs!
-Drinkability is perhaps lower than average due to the intensity of the bitterness.
-If you are turned off by the cat litter component of some hops, you might not like this brew.

4014,"2014-02-27",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2016 Draft at Deep Ellum on 2/14/14Mild haziness in the deep golden body and topped by a firm, fluffy white head that shows fair retention.Nicely hoppy in the nose, providing plentiful C-hop notes; orange, grapefruit some light mango and pineapple and pretty low on the hop resin or alcohol. Lightly sweet malts provide honey and touches of cream-of-wheat notes with a clean yeast (despite the haziness). Medium-high to high strength of aroma.Even better in the flavor, amazingly enough. Full of fruity hoppiness and moderately bitter citrus with only a kiss of pine on the end, culminating in more tropical fruits as it warms and a balancing but quite dry pale maltiness. Soft, almost creamy mouthfeel and no hop acid burn make this a standout beer and just an all-around well-done IPA. Certainly the best these guys offer and one Id happily drink any time. I like that the abv (while still high, objectively) is relatively low for the style. Would like to see a completely bright sample, which must be phenomenal if its this good with some sediment in it.  8/4/8/4/16Bottled January 2016 and drunk 1/15/16.Been needing to rerate this thing.  Amazing stuff and this batch just as good as any of the best.  Glad to see a return to form with the haziness and head retention.  As well, the beer is delightfully hoppy with a perfect texture, tons of juicy fruit and citrus.  Between this and the Enigma version, its very close for me as to which one I prefer, but regardless, both excellent beers.  Score reflects this bottle.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

4014,"2014-02-22",3.9,"Growler shared at RBWG, Friday night tasting at the roach motel. This is the kind of garbage juice Loines drinks, so it must be good.

Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a clean mouthfeel. Excellent APA.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
4014,"2014-02-15",4.5,"Hazy lemon yellow pour. Looks like a witbier. Creamy bone white head. Tons of lacing in the glass. Aroma initially is of actual hop pellets. Smells like sticking your nose in the fridge at the homebrew store. Then pineapple and mango come out. Lime and white grapefruit as well. Flavor is a huge hit of all kinds of juicy fruity hop flavors. This is citra dominated, so pineapple, mango and other tropical fruit are at the lead. Tons of that hop pellet dust flavor of pure unadulterated hops all over. Malt is light and understated. Just enough to contribute a light honey and biscuit foundation for hops to dance all over. Bitterness is ample and a bit strong for a pale, but softened by the aggressive juiciness of the hops. Palate is full and wet, completely thirst quenching. I cant get enough of this beer. A growler goes too fast. Everything Ive had from Trillium has been solid, but this is the standout, must try beer.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"

This is what a radler should taste like (if they didnt all suck), it would be awesome after a long bike ride on a sticky-hot day. Only downside is Trillium being limited to growlers and kegs for now, they could be a national name if they could start canning.
