Smells good, tons of Bastard malt with a strong herbal hop presence, and the pourÂ’s sexy enough. Tastes kind of muddled,though, like none of the various Bastard iterations present want to take the prominent role you want. Kind of a why bother beer, to be honest. I mean, Oaked BastardÂ’s the shit, so why dilute it with its brethren? Still tasty though, with the massive bitter back end of AB coming through while the sweet-bun caramel heft of Double Bastard thickens up the middle. Oak never really plays a part, unfortunately, and as a whole the beer kinda seems more gimmicky than great.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

I think the last time this was made CBB had just opened and I passed on it thinking IÂ’ll try it next year...



...little did I know it would then disappear for several years until I spotted this bottle on Rakuten. 

It was bottled on October 13 and is best before January 11th so itÂ’s getting a bit long in the tooth I guess. For this brew I cracked out my IPA glass in which I got a deep copper red color and a huge beige head that leaves copious lacing behind.

Straight from the fridge it is a bit on the cold side but gives me lots of sweet fruity hops, hints of oak and I even detect tobacco leaf. 

Medium bodied with a slightly raspy mouthfeel the taste is big bitter pine up front, then oak & dry whole tobacco leaf with some orange citrus notes in the finish.

2695,"2015-01-31",3.9,"Site was down yesterday (and I was not smart enough to write notes) so going off of memory. The smell and the mouth feel long after me taking a drink reminded me of pot so much, that I looked up if hops and marijuana were related. So, smell had a piney, dank like smell. It poured a dark amber with a half inch, dense creamy head. It was hop bitterness throughout on initial drinking, but as the beer warmed up, there was a caramel backed sweetness to it. I did prefer it after it warmed up a bit. Did not get any citrus from the hops. More of the pine type. Do not recall a major woodiness tasting in it. Mouth felt like it was coated afterwards. Reminded me of pot. I think it might have to do with the dry-hopped nature of the beer (as another dry hopped beer I had before gave me that same mouth feel.

Overall, I really enjoyed the beer, but am not sure I would buy again due to the price. It is not great enough to buy as a treat (like I do with a Chimay Grande Reserve), and there are so many other beers I enjoy that are cheaper.

2695,"2015-01-13",3.7,"Poured from a 22oz bottle into a snifter A - Smells woody and bitter. A little floral and funky as well. A - Has a similar look to Arrogant Bastard Ale. Reddish Brown, but a bit more murky. T - Taste is noticeably more bitter than Arrogant Bastard Ale. Definitely woody up front, then just a little bit of sweetness in the middle. The finish leaves you with a good amount of bitterness that sits in the mouth for a half minute or longer. Yummy P - Heavier body than ABA, but not too heavy. Still just as smooth. Not overly carbonated. O - An interesting variation of the Arrogant Bastard Ales. IÂ’ve not had the Oaked ABA before, but itÂ’s contribution to this blend is what I found to be most notably different from the original ABA. The extra hoppiness was enjoyable at first, but got to be a little overwhelming after a little while. The high bitterness clashed with the extra oaky smoothness just a bit. Nonetheless, this was a very enjoyable and intense beer!

Powerful, Christmas-y aroma that evokes a Pier-1 store. I mostly like the smell, but there are aspects of it that I donÂ’t favor. Flavor largely matches the aroma, but the emphasis is more on the dry hops than the sweet and rich malts, although both are present in the taste. Lemony hops. Prune juice and tree bark.

Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around that glass. Aromas of huge grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, floral, grass, oak, light vanilla, and floral/oak earthiness. Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of big citrus/tropical hops, moderate dark malt sweetness, and oak notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, floral, grass, oak, light vanilla, and floral/oak earthiness. Good amount of pine/grassy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, lemon zest, orange peel, pine, caramel, toffee, toast, oak, and floral/oak earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Fantastic complexity and balance of big citrus/tropical hops, dark/bready malt, and moderate oak flavors; with an awesome malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an fantastic blended strong ale style. All around awesome complexity and balance of big citrus/tropical hops, dark/bready malt, and moderate oak flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV.

2695,"2014-11-15",4.2,"StoneÂ’s Â“Lukcy Bastartd AleÂ” is a blend of their famous (and seminal) Arrogant Bastard Ale, as well as its two variations: Double Bastard Ale and Oaked Arrogant Bastard Ale (my favorite of the series). This is an aggressive, full-bodied, and unapologetic brew and itÂ’s quite wonderful. Huge hop bitterness, but actual hop flavor as well, coupled with a sturdy malt backbone and plenty of subtle notes. This is the craft beer drinkerÂ’s beer.

I poured a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 10/3/14.

Appearance: Gorgeous maroon/cherry red hue, transparent. Pours to a two-finger, off-white, soapy/foamy head which retains and laces very well.

Smell: Classic Chinook hop aroma with intense pine needles and slight orange peel zest.

Taste: Hops are definitely the stars of the show here. From the first moment thereÂ’s a strong, assertive and dry bitterness. ItÂ’s piney and astringent with a slight smoky character to it as well (almost deliberately phenolic, but without any off-putting traits). I taste pine needles, tree bark, and sticky resin throughout the first half. Once it crests and begins its descent, the sweet malty side emerges; toffee, caramel, maraschino cherry, blood orange, and vanilla are flavors I distinctly notice. ThereÂ’s a mild woody/earthy character here from the oak chips part of the beer is aged on, but is not as in-your-face as a beer actually aged in barrels. ThereÂ’s a dankness to the aftertaste, but itÂ’s quite pleasant. This isnÂ’t the kind of palette you encounter often and should be appreciated for its uniqueness.

Drinkability: Considering which beers go into this brew, itÂ’s actually a bit miraculous that Lucky Bastard Ale is not only drinkable, but highly drinkable at that. The mouthfeel is full, but not to the point of being sticky or chewy. ItÂ’s not spastically carbonated, in fact, itÂ’s actually a tad thinner than IÂ’d prefer. At 8.5% ABV the alcohol is well-masked, accounting only for the strength of the palette and not the density of the weight.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

This was poured into a snifter. 
The appearance was a decent hazy orange to brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute leaving some light speckled lacing trying to cling but sliding for the most part. 
The smell had a nice roasted oaky dried citrus peel (leaning towards orange, maybe lemon).
The taste was sweet and oaky with a tad of bitterness underneath and adding a nice light cocoa in at the end. 
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it, maybe...? The carbonation seemed good for the style and for me - decent sharpness but also a light smoothness as well.

2695,"2014-08-15",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 11-20-12-
S erved on tap in a 10 oz snifter

 Appearance Â– The beer is served a ruby brown color with a big off white head. The head has good retention but fades slowly to leave sticky lacing all on the sides of the glass and nice film on the top of the brew.

 Smell Â– The nose is heavy of pine and a grassy smell. Mixed with these aromas is a sweeter light fruit and some toffee. Rounding out the total smells is a good oaky smell that ties the sweet and hop aromas together nicely.

 Taste Â– The taste starts out heavy of pine hops with a biscuit and oaky taste. As the flavors move on some light fruit flavors come to the tongue. The hop flavors from the start remain just as strong as they were upfront, but are soon joined by a bitter grapefruit and a herbal hop nature. At the end a light citrus flavor come to the tongue along with a boozy flavor to leave an overall hopped green (pine and oak) taste on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel Â– The body of the beer is on the chewier side with a carbonation level that is a tad light. Both are quite nice for the wide variety of hop flavors experienced in the taste and help each to sit on the tongue and be detected individually.

 Overall Â– A nice variable hop profile flavor in this strong IPA. It has nice transitions and just enough breadiness and sweet to balance the hop and oaky flavors. Definitely one to try.","","Darkmagus82"

2695,"2014-03-24",3.7,"Rated on 12-05-2010 at S & V Liquors, Fort Wayne, IN. This bottled beer has a medium sized smooth ivory head with a short retention, hazy amber body, fizzy carbonation observed, and one ring of lacing. The aroma consists of caramel malt, citrus, pine, spruce hops, and grapefruit. The taste is lightly sweet, caramel malt, pine, moderately bitter, citrus hops, and mildly boozy. The mouth feel is lively carbonation and this beer is medium bodied. This is a hop heads delight as it is very hoppy and bitter tasting. It is too hoppy for my liking, but is worth trying nonetheless. It is a sipping beer for sure.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
2695,"2014-03-23",4.2,"1PT6FLOZ bottle. Pours a beautiful murky ruby colour with tiny visible sediment and a orangey beige head that leaves some pretty serious lacing. Smells AWESOME. Raisin, resinous hop notes, Panda licorice, dates, light earthiness, light raw pumpkin, and LyleÂ’s Golden Syrup. Sweet, with dried fruit, again, Panda licorice, soapy/resinous hop notes, spice, and some pretty good tongue tingling alcohol burn up front that leads into lots of eucalyptus like hop notes, and caramel malty notes in the finish. Comes across as a hopped up barley wine, but itÂ’s full on great. IÂ’d buy this again in a second.","Ontario, CANADA","Frothmeister"

Light beige head on top, quick to reduce to a small collar. Aroma is full of steel-y caramel malt, toasted bread, light wood, toffee, & a hint of brash hoppiness. Taste is malt heavy; lightly sweet caramel & toffee with some oak, prune, & light metallic notes in the background. A touch of earthiness, dirt, & borderline pine-y hops in the finish. Not bad, but this one is probably better fresh.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

A: Pours a burnt orange ale with single finger light tan head which dissipates quickly leaving non-confluent patches. Ale is a bit hazy, with sharp light shine, but little clarity on shapes. Moderate, sticky lacing.

S: Hops - standard Stone...Piney with apples, citrus, earth, and a shine of spice. malt background is unique in this blend: I smell seafoam (candy). Hints of oak and remains slightly alcoholic.

T: Bitter, malty, cream of tarter, alcohol, oaky astringency. Very, very distant marzipan on finish. Not too impressed here with this one.

M: Slick, fine carbonation in a medium to heavy body. Leaves my tongue a bit coated and creamy, which is a nice surprise and levels out the bitterness quite a bit.

D: This is a good beer. Not great, and not an anniversary caliber beer by any means. Good experiment, worth one try.

3.5 A: Clear copper amber color. Two and a half fingers of frothy beige head. Retention is decent and a diffuse lattice of foamy lacing is left.

3.5 T: Taste is like the nose. Piney and floral hop flavor. Caramel, toffee, toastiness, and neutral malt maltiness. Dark fruits.

3.5 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Lightly creamy and quite smooth.

I finished a 22oz bomber by myself, so that lasted quite long. Aroma is incredible and hits you directly when opening the bottle. It is heavy malted, oaky and carries a lot of molasses and dark, burnt sugar with it. When I took my first sip, I was a bit dissappointed. Very harsh on the palate, big alcoholic and bitter hoppy flavours did not really suit this beer. But luckily it smoothened out became well balanced. I would call this a very hopped up barley wine. Great sipper, flavours of very dark fruit and sugars, backened by some typical West Coast hop bitterness. Finish is short to medium and lingers on being a bit bitter.

Toffee, grass, orange peel, and sweet lemon on the nose. The mouthfeel is wet, smooth, full, but lacking carbonation sting. ThereÂ’s a less offensive hop presence in this concoction than is normal for Stone. In fact, it might even be described as drinkable. I note a lot of pine and a little orange. ThereÂ’s some balance.

Color is a sort of muddy brownish, with minimal head leaving swirling patterns on the glass as it recedes.  Constant but not heavy bubble streams.  Taste is, as expected, significantly bitter, with some woody undertones and an odd sort of sweetness hitting the tongue right when you start a sip.  Lots of earthy and floral hops dominate, with the earthy tastes lingering the longest.  Not as absurdly bitter as some of its constituent beers, but definitely still a bit of a kick in the tongue.  No real taste of the 8.5% ABV can be noticed.  Mouthfeel is sort of thin, lightly carbonated, a bit soapy.  Like most of the bastards, IÂ’m not a huge fan.","California, USA","jdavidh"

Some good aspects, but both the Arrogant and Double (especially Double!) far exceed this.

Taste is rich malty smooth/slick,yet robust,with lots of hop,earthy/pine, with fruit and very piney  strong bittering. Long lingering  super strong bittering pine. Some strong dry woodiness intertwines the pine but the pine overpowers more in strength of flavor and bittering. Incredibly bitter.

Hoppy smell that sort of leads you on about what the flavor will be. I found the flavor to have a decent bitterness but I felt like the oaked bastard really dominated. It would be interesting to learn what the blend percentages are but IÂ’d guess its ""classifiedÂ’. Alcohol was noticeable and IÂ’m sure the double bastard was responsible. This was good but I think regular old arrogant bastard may be the best bastard.

Lighter head on the beer, immediately clings to the glass and persists.Aroma - Smell immediately fills your nose with sweet flowery notes. Has the nose of an IPA with big citrus and floral American hops. The nose lingers, to the point I thought I had some still on my upper lip. Really great smell.Taste - Mouth instantly coated with strong bittering hops. Nothing unappealing, but clearly a hoppy beer; however, unlike an IPA, there is some clear focus on the malt with this brew. A nice dark malt has enough sweetness to balance some of the bitter and give it a light roasty flavor. Smell and Taste work hand in hand on this brew to make a great final product. Hop heavy, but malt wasn?t ignored. Alcohol burn is present, especially in the after taste, but not necessarily a negative. Citrus/grapfruit flavor really comes in after a few sips. Delicious hop blend. Mouthfeel - Feels slightly heavy initially, but quickly lightens up with the carbonation. Balanced nicely with the carbonation, not a meal in the glass, but not ""refreshing"". Good mouthfeel.Overall - Not the perfect beer, but delicious. Clearly similar roots to Arrogant Bastard, will have to look up comments on the two. Strong alcohol, but not overbearing alcohol flavor. Hoppy up front with a nice malty sweet balance on the backend. The bomber won?t be going to waste, that?s for sure.","","MikeEnIke"

The hops show up again after this, but now theyÂ’re more earthy and citrus rind with a little grapefruit in the back.   ThereÂ’s a aged feel and taste to this that makes it almost whiskey-like in a way without really having a whiskey taste.  Finishes smooth but grippingly bitter on the tongue.

2695,"2012-02-28",3.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 11/17/2010.  Fortunate to try this on tap at Fountainhead. Served in a tulip.

Like the other Bastards, this pours a dark cherry / mohagony color, with a fluffy off-white head that retains nicely, with generous lacing coating the glass.

A bit herbally in the nose from almost excessive dry hopping. Earthy and citrus hop notes are present as well. Some dark fruits manage to make themselves known, smells like figs and raisins from Crystal 120. 

Light dark fruit flavors with the semi sweet malt to start. I enjoy the use of this malt in the Bastards. The malt flavor really is pushed aside by the earthy, grassy hops. Bitter and strong in flavor, the hop presence is quite strong. The end does not wrap up as nicely as I wish it would, maybe a bit more OAB in there would be nice. 

Not quite to stout level, but this has quite a full feel, with a fair amount of hop oil. The carbonation is consistent, but it almost feels creamy and lightly carbonated. 

The overall experience is quite intense and would be too much to handle more than once. I enjoyed the newest member of the Bastard family, but for my money there is not a Bastard better than the OAB.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

When fresh the smell on this beer is fantastic!  Your nose is hit with citrus and pine but itÂ’s not all hops.  There is a really nice and clean caramel background.  Everything is nice and big in the smell and so fresh.  But whereÂ’s the oak?

Oh!  There it is.  ItÂ’s prevalent in the taste.  But first just like in the aroma you are greeted with really fresh hoppy aromas.  Fruity, Pine, citrus, grassy, etc.  Then mid palette the oak comes through nicely mixed in with the deep caramel flavor.  In the end though you can definitely tell this beer was dry hopped a ton.  ItÂ’s just a beautiful mixture here.  I could drink this all damn night.  One of my favorite Stone brews ever.

2695,"2011-04-25",4.7,"THOUGHTS: Sampled in a Double Bastard glass, which was a Christmas gift from my wife. It was nothing earth-shattering, but was perfectly balanced and better than the sum of the three beers blended. A fine example of wine just happening and beer being crafted. It may have been high in IBUs, but the malt balances things so well that the hop flavors and not the hop bitterness is the star of the show. Hid alcohol fairly well.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a medium to dark reddish, orangey amber with a small to average, creamy, golden beige or cream-colored head that left excellent lacing. The aroma was great, but slightly weak at ties. There was moderate to heavy molasses and caramel; heavy pine, grapefruit and orange hops; lighter resinous hops; apple, cherry, hints of wood, vanilla and light alcohol. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and rather bitter while the finish was rather sweet ad heavily bitter with a very long duration. There was brown sugar, caramel malt, pine hops, grapefruit hops, candied grapefruit, other citrus hops, vanilla, slight wood, a hint of smoke, resinous hops, cherry and slight grape. The heavier than medium body was oily yet creamy with fairly soft yet tingly carbonation and a slightly alcoholic and very dry finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

How: Bottle 22oz.  Many times.  From uber-fresh (2 weeks after beer release) to 3 months after bottling (first batch)
The look: Beautiful dark red topped by a small beige head
In long: The nose has a whole lot of floral, citrusy and piney hope juice.  In mouth I can recognise my good old Arrogant Bastard superb caramelized malt backbone except that now it is pleasantly swimming in a pool of hop juice.  I also recognize the drier more oaky red-ale character of the Oak Aged Arrogant Bastard.  But this beer is so heavily dry-hopped that it is an entire different beast altogether.  Crusty bread and caramelized woody cereals swimming in plenty of hops juice and hops resin.  I wish Stone would make it a regular offering.  Unlike the Arrogant Bastard and its Oak Aged sister, the Lukcy Basartd is one that should be consumed fresh.  Do not age, drink now.  If you drink this beer fresh and you donÂ’t like it then I recommend you play a game with the empty bottle.  You put the empty bottle in front of you and stare at it, with the right luminosity and at the right angle you can make up the face of someone who has no taste in beer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Color is a deep mahogany with a single-finger tan head and a pretty good amount of lacing along with a few bubbles around the edges. Nose is nice and hoppy with good notes of resinous pine and citrus. ThereÂ’s a bit of oak in the background.

The taste falls off in a big way from the nose and it cannot be discussed without mentioning the mouthfeel, which is quite dry and tannic. The oak has just really taken this one over and while there is some faint pine and caramel in the background, I get mostly oak along with a bit of heat. I expected a lot from this beer, but only the aroma really delivered.

T - Starts off with a hit of caramel sweetness and some nice piney hops. Touch of oak in the background. Through the middle, more of the hop flavor and bitterness come through. Also a bit more of the oak flavor coming through. The finish is a mix of the sweet toffee malts, the hops flavor and bitterness, some citrus, and some nice oak flavors that linger for a while. 

M - Medium0full bodied with moderate-low but lively carbonation. Really smooth and almost a bit oily. Excellent finish with a touch of dryness.

D - Very drinkable. The 8.5% abv here is extremely well masked and the flavors are very well balanced. Very nice hop and malt balance and the oak flavors blends with them extremely well.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"

2695,"2011-03-18",3.9,"Bomber from BOTW (Rochester), served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass. Beer #1600! 
App.:  Very deep mahogany, clear with a decent tan head.
  
Aroma:  Thick and rich in both malts and hops, gooey caramel/toffee/brown sugar, plenty of big C-hops notes...pine, resin, grapefruit, marmalade, a bit floral, a touch mashy and dusty, sufficient citrus brightness to overcome the BIG, thick malt background.
  
Palate:  I feel...lucky?  Medium-full body, soft, velvety effervescence, smooth.
  
Flav.:  A little more hop than malt, compared to the nose, big pine and resin, plenty of grapefruit, still lots of caramel/toffee/brown sugar, peppery for sure, spicy, big and bold; lightly sweet with impressive bitterness and a strong pine and dust and caramel finish.

2695,"2011-03-17",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
Citrusy hop resins inspire this American Strong AleÂ’s berry-laden caramel malts to achieve a most credible supporting role, while proficient green bitterness wows the palate with clarity. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A tower of foam lays claim to the clear auburn.
-The freshness of the hop aroma and flavor is astounding, especially for a strong brew.
-The big, soft bubbles are perfectly calculated to make all flavors levitate in unison.
-The body is relatively lean, helping the tastebuds to focus on the deliciously outgoing hop personality.

2695,"2011-03-14",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2014 650ml bottle. 

It pours a clear reddish-brown with a foamy off-white head that sticks for a bit and recedes to some ok lacing.

The smell is nice but I expected more. It is sweeter than I expected with a nice resinous hop smell with both citrus and pine. The malt is rather caramally and a hint of alcohol can be whiffed.

The flavor comes across better to me than the smell. It has that nice hop kick with a big long hit of bitterness. The sweetness comes through to provide a bit of balance, but it isnÂ’t as prevalent in the taste as it was in the smell. There is also a nice woodiness. This one is so delicious but I would take both the Double and the Oaked over it.

The mouthfeel and drinkability are both perfect. It is a very nice beer.

You can tell there are a fair amount of malts in there also, but they are hidden by the hops.  The taste is up front with the citrus hops, but balanced with the malts nicely.  DonÂ’t get me wrong, there are a ton of hops but they are somewhat muted with the malts.  Some raostiness, oakiness, caramel and a dry finish:  no sweetness here at all.

Nose: hoppy, woody, barky, and some white oak for good measure. Apple and pear flesh. Bitterness of pine resins in the back along with pine cones and fir tree needles. Caramel red apple crunchies. The wood and bark is nicely pervasive and just abrasive enough.

Palate: clean powerful bitterness quenches and induces thirst at same time. Almost waxy along with a piney resiny polished bite. Caramelized crunchy sweetness. Cinnamon sticks for spice along with generic dry brown spices and wood. Hop cones dance atop my tastebuds. Citrus skins.

Final Thoughts: another fine in-your-face beer from Stone Brewing. Read the back label if you can, if you dare try. Overall in the wide beery scheme of things though I still prefer their standard Arrogant Bastard and Oaked Arrogant Bastard.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

This all sets up on a sweet brown sugary and toffee like malty backbone. It also has a very slight hint of earthy woody oak. This adds another nice layer of subtle complexity. The finish has a pleasant hop bitter linger that just hangs on long enough to be interesting and note over stay its welcome.

The flavor is very woody, between the piney hops, toasted malts, and actual oak. Then comes an interesting fruity sweetness that I wasnÂ’t really expecting.

Aroma: Full of citrus hops (grapefruit and pineapple), resin, as well as some caramel notes

Flavor: The taste is rather big, with medium-heavy sweetness and heavy bitterness as well

I guess IÂ’m the only person on earth who hasnÂ’t tried this one yet, huh?

Seriously though, I had been meaning to try it, I was just a little slower then the rest of the world to pick up a bottle.

The flavor is where this one shines though with the classic Stone hop bill.  Bitter resins and grapefruit supported by a thick malty backbone.  Sweet toffee and caramelized malts contribute to the hefty body.  This is hopped aggressively so that the dry bitter hops can match, and overtake all that malt.  The dry hopping is evident.

2695,"2011-01-12",3.8,"Bomber, as fresh as I could get it.  Pours the familiar dark, dusky, clear rusty-red amber color.  A tall, pretty head of beige-khaki foam leaves gobs of sticky, feathered wall lacing on the glass as it slowly settles to a modest, lasting, patchwork cap.  On the nose, the dry hopping is immediately apparent, reaching up from the glass to infiltrate the nose with sticky pine resins, bright orange, and grapefruit at levels beyond that which I am accustomed to within any other variant of the Bastard series.  Of course, there is an ample malt base of caramel and toasty toffee, along with rich bread at varying stages in the baking process.  Fruits such as grilled plum and cooked dates also emerge, while the oak imparts a soft kiss of clean woodiness.  Flavors largely follow suit, packing the hop wallop of a hefty Imperial Red, yet amply balanced by a lush blend of toasted toffee, caramelized plums, and various other grilled stone fruits.  Pine and grapefruit linger on well after the swallow, bathing the tongue in bitter resins, distributed evenly by a big but relatively silky body that sports active, fine carbonation and a sticky-dry, slightly tacky finish.  IÂ’m trying my damnedest to hate this beer, but I canÂ’t.  ItÂ’s pretty solid, and IÂ’m really digging the dripping, resinous hop profile over the caramelized fruit backdrop.  Get it fresh, without a doubt, as this will be a shadow of its former self in a few short months.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Finishes bitter as expected with pine, grapefruit, and burned toast winning out (while caramel sticks to the tongue for a while).

Other aroma notes include tropical fruit, pine, cat piss, and a muted maltiness.  The flavor also is big on some sharp hop tones (citrus, pine) but is excellently balanced with a lightly sweet but strong malt presence.

2695,"2011-01-10",4.0,"22 ounce bottle - $6.99 at BullockÂ’s Wine & Spirits in Marietta, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a clearish, amber-brown body with a goodly-sized, foaming, off-white head.

Smell: This Stone bastard saturnalia smells of sliced, oily citrus fruits, rigid Colorado Blue spruce planks, and a firm, unapologetic grassiness marked by sweet-scented, cooked sugar notes and a subtler hint of toasted malt.

Taste: Sweetish affront upfront with chewy toffee and moderately toasted barley enveloped in caramelized sugars. Staunchly grassy, with bold hoppy flavors of pithy grapefruit peelings, concentrated resins, shredded mint leaves, and segmented tangerines, producing acidic, raunchy hop-burps. Cutting, caustic bitterness. Small surge of yeastiness midway. Very faint trace of the Â’OakedÂ’ variety. Warming, clear cut alcohol on the citrusy, earthy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: The bitterness and alcohol certainly keeps me at a slow, tenuous pace. A nice, bitter, one-bottle diversion to while away the hours being trapped under a blanket of rare Atlanta snow.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

The taste is well balanced for the most part between the hop bitters and sweet malt base. Twangy and citric fruitiness, resiny hop flowers, caramel and toffee leading towards a slight oaky and vanilla finish. The mouth feel is not as aggressive as the normal Arrogant Bastard and leans more towards the Double Bastard and Oaked versions, lush and sticky with moderate alcohol, a slight metallic finish.

2695,"2011-01-08",3.6,"Enjoyed from a 22oz bomber in an English pint glass.  The beer pours a medium to deep amber color, with a smallish and quickly disappearing off-white head.  The nose is initially slight, showing a slight tea-like note, a very slight wood note, and some somewhat muddled background character malt notes.  As the beer warms, the latter notes sharpen, showing some high crystal/special B raisony notes.  The palate is fairly malt-forward, again showing a rather muddy character initially, along with a fairly prevalent alcohol note, and some interesting fruit notes that appear toward the finish.  The finish itself leaves a lingering note of alcohol, and the aforesaid tea-like note.

2695,"2010-12-27",3.8,"650 mL bottle from AJÂ’s in Tucson, served in a tulip. Pours clear mahogany with a medium dense head. The head fades slowly to a thin cover and leaves a moderate amount of fine lace. The nose has big aromas of resin and pine, flowers and caramel, along with some fruit and a touch of oak. The flavour starts out with a touch of caramel malt sweetness but is soon eclipsed by a huge piney, resinous bitterness that persists to the finish. The finish is long and resinous hoppy bitter. On the palate, it is medium-full in body with a smooth, oily texture and average carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent, well-constructed hop bomb.

Looks great!

Complex aroma with a prominent sweet citrus hop presence up front as well as some earthy pine, sweet caramel malt, oak and vanilla. IÂ’m actually picking up notes from each individual beer used in the blend. Slightly toasted underneath with a slight biscuit character in the nose.

Chewy body thatÂ’s on the fuller end with a very complex flavor profile. A blast of bitter earthy and sweet citrus hops up front that lingers throughout over the sweet malt backbone into a slightly dry warm finish. Lots of earthy pine up front as well as some citrus peel and grapefruit. IÂ’m actually surprised how bitter this is up front even for Stone. This is countered nicely mid-palate by a sweet caramel malt character that is nice and toasty with hints of biscuit, oak and vanilla. The hops are still the prominent flavor but the malt and oak notes provide decent balance. The high ABV is well masked with only slight warmth in the finish making this beast very quaffable.

Oak is noticeable too, and is the first noticeable quality of the taste. Plenty of hop bitterness, and a bit of fruity sweetness too, maybe from raisin and plum.

2695,"2010-12-23",3.5,"A solid pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces an almost three finger thick, richly amber tinged, tan colored head that leaves lots of lacing on the sides of my glass as it slowly subsides.  The beer is a dark, almost burnt amber hue that shows a brilliantly clear, deep red hue when held up to the light.  The aroma smells thick with piney and citrus focused hops, but also has a backbone of chewy crystal malt.  The nose is made up of aromas of tangerine, surprising-but-subtle cedar, a green herbaceous character, a strong nutty note that mixes in with the cedar, very woody oriented fresh cut pine planks and a sort of dustiness that I canÂ’t quite place, but which seems to incorporate the surprising cedar note, the nuttiness and the fresh cut pine planks.  

Nicely bitter tasting as the beer first hits my tongue, but the biting bitterness only grows as it rolls across my tongue and it lingers on the palate for quite some time after my first sip, though it slowly fades.  Sweet, crystal malt focused notes contribute a touch of sweet-tea like character, perhaps a hint of astringency (though this gets wrapped up in the green hop notes and the oak), a touch of nuttiness and maybe even a hint of dark, sort of roasted malt character.  The malt accentuates fruity hop notes that remind me of ruby-red grapefruit, bright tangelo zest, some lychee (especially more toward the finish).  There is actually a surprising amount of malt character in this beer; it is indeed dominantly hoppy, but the malt is not far behind.  The malt character doesnÂ’t put this in chewy, viscous Barleywine territory, but it certainly provides some body and texture to this mediumÂ’ish beer.  Some touches of alcohol are noticeable as a slight warming / heat in the finish where it mixes with spicy oak and hop notes.  The oak definitely seems to boost the hot alcohol feel in the finish and also contributes some woody astringency.  As the beer warms up the hop fruit character becomes a bit more apparent with more of the citrus and tropical fruit notes and perhaps even a touch of oak-derived vanillin starts to come out.

Definitely a nice beer, as with the base beers this seems to have lost the vibrancy and surprise that this had for me early on; there are now a lot of beers that are more Â“arrogantÂ”, but this beer is still an aggressive mix of hop and malt character.  The oak is interesting here, the oakÂ’ed arrogant bastard is likely the smallest percentage, but it still seems to be a bit too harsh here rather than achieving the vanillin / toasted wood character that I much prefer from my oak character in beer.  My second poor even has a touch of buttery oak to it and really as it warms up a fair amount a big, wood-driven pepper note becomes noticeable in the nose and even more so in the flavor of this beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2695,"2010-12-16",3.2,"So this is like a mix of ten different kinds of Arrogant Bastard dry hopped and put in a bottle w/ annoying writing on the bottle. ThatÂ’s OK by me, I just wanted to point that out. ItÂ’s a deep red brew w/ a little ring of a white head. The nose is hops first, malt never... well, almost never. Thick, resinous piny tones meld w/ warm citrus , spice and alcohol. This is surprisingly mild flavorwise, though. The strong bitterness youÂ’d expect from the nose never materializes and itÂ’s actually verging on being a bit watery. There is a bit of oak character and some sweetness but itÂ’s a bit disappointing after the nose. Medium bodied w/ moderate carbonation, this sits somewhere in between something youÂ’d want to drink quickly and a slow sipper, which is pretty much what it is. This isnÂ’t a bad beer but itÂ’s not really anything special either. Congrats to Stone on 13 years of Bastard!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Pours a cloudy reddish amber, with a medium-sized creamy tan head. That old familiar super-hopped red on the nose, with a bit of oak masked by a punch of piney, resinous hops and a thick layer of caramel malts. Dear God is this ever tasty. A blend of these three brews is perfect - the original AB is great, but leaves you wanting more. The double can be a bit hot, and the oaked version is simply too oaky - it covers too much of the flavor. This takes a bit of all three. Big, thick mouthfeel - slightly boozy, but not at all offensive in that respect. Tons of hops - this one finishes very dry, making you feel a bit like youÂ’ve just stuck a drop of pine sap in your mouth. Make no mistake - this is a palate bomb. And maybe itÂ’s just their claims of liquid arrogance and how weÂ’re not worthy that make us want to be okay with just how much of a tongue wrecker this brew is.

WeÂ’re also both from san diego...well not me originally, but what the hey, its where I call home these days, so fuck it.  The beer seems to have been filtered through a solid piece of glass though the deep woody color is sort of nice looking.  The head too, stays fairly dolid..maybe a bit too wet to lace, but still a nice complimenting light tan covering to the crystal clear wood stained beer.  Nose-wise its got the classic bastard smell though tamer on the hop notes...its got that fruity essence of nectarine and pear with a caramel note here and there...nothing offensive other than it being very 
stone_esque. 
Flavorwise...this is actually a lot more refined and classy than regular arrogant bastard as well as lighter on the palate than both double bastard and arrogant bastard...I like this better than both of those others...this is what regular bastard should have been all along.  The palate does seem a bit watery though but the flavors are there and their refined enough not to come across as a sloppy slap in the face.  A drinkable beer and actually a pretty damn successful blend of beers for stone, especially with regular bastard being one of the beers...or is it the oaked one or both, I still donÂ’t understand.  I wonÂ’t be buying this again because its still steaming with stone house character, as it should since its just a blend, but I donÂ’t have too many bad things to say about it all things considered.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"

Its like the other Arrogant Bastard interpretations: very hoppy, but without a specific direction.  Its citric, herbal, and resinous, but is somehow not complexly hoppy, just sort of muddled with all of these qualities at once.  Regardless, this is a damn delicious beer!

2695,"2010-11-26",3.7,"On tap at Malt and Vine. This beer was quite pungent. I didnÂ’t get a lot of the oak as others did; however, it did have a very nice pine hop aroma that was quite pungent. Also, there was a nice subtle malt sweetness coming through. A little boozy on the nose, I believe this is from the Double Bastard, considering that is the strongest. A tad thinner than the Arrogant, because of the increase in the ABV, I think this runs a little ""thin"". Still, this has an excellent texture. I was told this is a fairly fresh keg, so hops werenÂ’t a problem. This beer had a nice clean pine hop flavor. Nice lasting bitterness, and a slight boozy quality kicks in as well. Could do without the booze, but this is still pretty good. Not getting any oak as suggested -- maybe the hop flavor has to die down a bit before this happens. While I was trying this I was reminded of the 13th Anniversary, and then I read the description, and quite frankly, I donÂ’t think the blending of all the beers was necessary, but it surely is interesting.

2695,"2010-11-25",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2010 This is undoubtedly the greatest Basartd of them all.  Perhaps the freshness of the beer can claim to be the reason for that opinion...  But this is excellent.  Exceedingly hop forward, yet without the abrasive and slightly astringent palate of the standard Bastard.  This is, for me, what the Basartd ought to be.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","temporrari"

2695,"2010-11-24",3.0,"I had this on tap at Fountainhead in Chicago, IL.  I actually went specifically to Fountainhead to try this seemingly rare brew, and I canÂ’t say the juice was worth the squeeze.  Appearance is a very dark ruby red with a creamy, prominent head.  Aroma was rather faint, not too much other than a bit of skunky hops.  Taste was honestly like a cough syrup.  ItÂ’s very much an ""earthy"" brew, so much in the sense that it overwhelms the tastebuds to the point where it lingers in the back of your throat and you feel like youÂ’ve been sick for a week.  Very strange, so much that I almost didnÂ’t finish the glass I ordered.  IÂ’m a huge Stone fan and disappointed by this one...maybe IÂ’ll try it in bottle form to see if I get different results.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"
2695,"2010-11-24",3.7,"Bottle.  Good beer, but the idea is stronger than the execution.  IÂ’m a big fan of blending and hope that more brewers explore the process, but every blended beer isnÂ’t a masterpiece.  This beer has a bit too much of the raw and rough flavors of fresh DB for my tastes.  ThereÂ’s a relatively strong booze-acetone note in the aroma that drowns out some of the complexity.  There are also some very nice notes of caramel and aggressive pine/grapefruit rind hops.  Taste-wise, itÂ’s quite successful.  ThereÂ’s a wonderfully bitter pine resin/citrus pith tone on top of layers of caramel malt sweetness.  The finish is a bit astringent at first, but thatÂ’s more of a palate issue.  Some very nice flavors coat the mouth and linger.  Also, the beer is quite pretty - darkened reddish amber with a thick ecru head.  Lucky Bastard is a wonderful expression of StoneÂ’s influential viewpoint in American craft beer.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
2695,"2010-11-24",3.4,"Bottle from Midtown. Pours a very nice deep, dark amber red with a two fingers tan head. Aroma of oak, berries, and citrusy hops. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Initial flavor of caramel that is quickly countered by a spicy and biting hoppiness. Dry and bitter finish has a nagging green flavor, and is a tad boozy. Oak has a strong presences as well, and leaves a lingering pepper note. On paper, this sounds phenomenal. In reality, itÂ’s rather underwhelming. I think this will improve with a little more time in the bottle, as I think Stone releases stuff when itÂ’s a little young.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"

Explosion of hops aromas that seem to cover it all - grapefruit, pine, resin, floral - as well as generous caramel, toast, vanilla, and alcohol.

2695,"2010-11-24",4.5,"Pours out dark brownish red, with a pretty medium sized tan head, lots of sticky lacing.  Smell is incredible!  Im getting sweet grapefruit, pine+citrus+grass hops, some wood, and some burnt honey.  Not sure if my words could do it justice, but it smells great, and if you like Stone, youÂ’ll be blown away by the aroma alone.  The taste is just as incredible.  Disclaimer: I never had Oaked or Double Bastard, just regular Arrogant Bastard before this.  I wish I had so I can have some reference, but for whatever its worth, I like this much much better than Arrogant Bastard.  Its more mellowed out in many ways and more balanced and more complex.  Tastes that come through are sweet grapefruit, brown sugar, pine and flowery hops, a backbone of burnt caramel malt, and bitter herb (without making it too bitter).  The end is as bitter as you would expect from an Arrogant or a ASA, but IÂ’m finding it somewhat delightful, even as a stout lover.  What a beer!  Superbly made, delicious, dare I say, approachable?  Stone, keep making this brew.  ItÂ’s your best yet.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

2695,"2010-11-23",4.0,"Great addition to the ""Bastard"" legacy.  Pours deep red with a creamy off-white head.  Strong bright carbonation which delivers a beautiful hop aroma.  I appreciate that the malt characteristics are present, but the hops hold the court here. It has a pleasant, delicate malt sweetness in the aroma as well. Delivers a strong bitterness both from hops as well as a delicate alcohol bite.  The bitterness is sustained on the palate, but gives way to hop flavor over just bitterness.  The only thing I felt detracted from the beer was that it was ""a bit"" & I mean ""a bit"" muddled in the blending of flavors.  The hops overshadowed the oak, but no to a degree that I found it a flaw.  Just wanted to mention it for good measure.","Sonoma, California, USA","bumpskier"

Aroma is a mostly standard piney citrusy hop forwardness with, to a much lesser degree, a biscuity maltiness to goalong with it. I might be imagining it but there might be a trace if vanilla and oak on the backend but I may be reaching... Flavors are of citrus and herbal tea notes, an earthy bitterness through the middle, and finishes off with an oaky soft vanilla presence while still maintaining an adequate bitterness.

A touch of vanilla and oak sweetness, light cherry cola syrup.  Strong bitter flavor, dry, herbal and pine.  Sweetness is subtle and kept in check by the strong hops.  The bitterness is fairly generic though, which detracts from the overall flavor.  ItÂ’s not bad, itÂ’s just not impressive.  Finishes with wet oak. Cola like carbonation.

As for the beer, it pours a deep lightly hazed amber with a moderate amber/white head that lasted until the last sip and laced the glass very well.  Huge aroma of resinous pine with a lesser amount of malt and citrus.  The flavor begins with a solid dose of malt, lightly sweet, which is followed by a solid dose of resinous pine.

2695,"2010-11-16",4.0,"#5!-On tap at 38 Degrees Alehouse and Grill 
Appearance: Pours a deep fairly translucent dark red. Atop sits a dense, creamy cap, that retains for most of the session.

Aroma: Big herbal hop and spicy sweet malt.

Taste: Bitter, aggressive hops, sugary spicy malt, and alcohol.  Very fresh and abrasive.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied, not quite as thick as Double Bastard Ale. Sticky with prickly carbonation.

Overall: A really big, fresh bitter as fukc beer.  The art of this beer is in the blending. It seems blended so well, it really takes a while to distinguish it from itÂ’s fresh component beers. 

To sum it up, if you like Arrogant Bastard Ale, Double Bastard Ale and or OAKED Arrogant Bastard, you will like this. With that said, this isnÂ’t far off the beaten path of either Arrogant or Double Bastard Ale, so know that going in.

2695,"2010-11-15",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2011 On tap at RnH, where ""Lucky"" was spelled correctly.  We were trying to figure out what it was.  We thought the lucky may have referred to a little wild yeast, but apparently not.  This appears to be a blend of Stone Bastard ales: Oaked Arrogant Bastard, Double Bastard, and plain old Arrogant Bastard.  CanÂ’t go wrong there!   Fresh, herby, sweet aroma.  Really good, full flavor - nutty and saturated.  Some light sourness and bitterness coming into play as well.  One sign of Stone greatness is when you can take a sip and say, ""Ah, this is by Stone.  I canÂ’t put my finger on what it is I am tasting that is unique to Stone, but unique to Stone it is.""  Later on, I did take a couple of points off when I had it from a bottle.  Then it tasted more yeasty, not as impressive as it was on draft.  And the incoherent label notes werent as much fun as they were supposed to be.","USA","Slipstream"
2695,"2010-11-15",3.4,"Draft at fountainhead. This bastard poured a dark ruby red with foamy off with head. The aroma comes off a little oxidized surprisingly papery, some caramilized dates soaked in booze, a subdued grapefruit hop notes. Flavors are rather sweet, intense maltiness that are astringent and slight copper at times while citrus and grapefruity notes pop threw with some oak as well. A full mouth feel that has a syrupy linger on the palate.   Long simple brown sugar maltiness sits cloyingly.  I think itÂ’s more well rounded than each part on itÂ’s own, at least double bastard.  Arrogant/double bastard was definetly one of my gateway beers but at this point in the game these are just far too sweet and one dimensional for me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

Aromas of wood and toast hide in the background.  Sweet and earthy, big juicy hop flavors.  Long bitterness on the finish, with light wood notes (which I would note have minded becoming more prominent), before a swell of grapefruit and quinine.

Clear cherry wood with a large cream colored head that lasts for pretty much the whole beer.  Great hop forward aroma with some pine and citrus.  After sitting awhile it becomes more malt balanced.  Sweet with notes of toffee and alcohol.  The flavor is a large mix of malt and hops.  The malt dries out leaving a nice long bitterness and alcohol warmth.  The right amount of sweetness and hops for my taste.  Medium bodied.  The 22oz disappeared quickly, so nice and fresh.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
