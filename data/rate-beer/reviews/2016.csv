Once cautiously released, Horst emerges from an earthy Black Forest thicket, his rough redbrown fur damp with firwood dew, crusty with mulched pine needles, treading through pelleted grapefruit peel and woodpulped bark.

Midway surges of faint caramel and gentle milk chocolate are in the finish rebuked by a resinous, pithy citrus zest finish, reinforced by a helping of herbal tea UFOs . 

Its near wheaty-smooth body helps to cushion the multiple blows of its drying, deft resinous paws. Retronasal aftermath of the encounter: herbal woodsy, near-minty lemon blossom and lime peel, pulverised. 

Unlike its softer-treading older Black Sheep sister, this young and eager spectacled brown bear on-the-loose is up for a rumble, not wanting to be quite the same taste bud cuddler to unwarned palates venturing forth into Freiburgs now wide open landscape. / / / 2016-7: Update one year in, the Horst still abiding (Sud 2-3): really coming to terms with the Horsts citrus pithy and piney paws on dry and wafer thin chocolatey malts, making it both a defiant and subtle brew.
