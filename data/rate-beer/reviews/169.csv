169,"2017-06-03",4.6,"Our Black Marlin Porter is the perfect beer for a mocha mashup. The addition of coffee and cocoa plays perfectly of the roasty, chocolaty flavors of this English porter, while a hint of vanilla smooths it all out. It’s full-bodied, but not too sweet; try it for breakfast...or dessert.

Not overly chocolate. Great beer.

169,"2017-05-28",4.3,"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 9/27/2016. Pours clear nearly opaque dark brown/black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and rocky khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge nutty medium roast coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, fudge, toffee, brown sugar, and toasted dark bread; with lighter notes of vanilla, cream, smoke, fruitiness, herbal, roast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, and light earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of huge nutty medium roast coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, fudge, toffee, brown sugar, and toasted dark bread; with lighter notes of vanilla, cream, smoke, fruitiness, herbal, roast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate herbal hop and roast/coffee bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of nutty coffee, milk/dark chocolate, cocoa, caramel, fudge, toffee, brown sugar, toasted dark bread, light smoke/vanilla, and roast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, and light earthy hop flavors; with an awesome roasted bitter/sweet balance, and zero acrid/astringent flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from hop/roasted bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready/grainy, and lightly silky/sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 6%. Overall this is an amazing American coffee porter! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee, and light earthy hop flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. Huge and vibrant on coffee complexity, with a spot on base porter that is never overly roasty. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

169,"2017-05-23",3.8,"Pours a very dark brown with a red hue (highlights?). A short-lived light brown/beige head sits on top and recede into a small rim that leaves some lacing. Nose is that of your morning coffee so I guess the mocha theme is pretty much a success.Taste is more of the same with more of the chocolate/cocoa peeking through. Never ashy. Some light vanilla. Body is on the lighter side (Id like it to be a little richer) and carbonation is moderate. A bit sticky. Overall a fairly solid mocha porter. Not quite ""dessert-y"" but still pretty tasty and a nice way to end the day.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

This beer pours chocolate brown with average foam and carbonation, like the original recipe. The coffee addition is all over the nose and tongue. This beer smells and tastes like rich, slightly sweet espresso and a little bit of chocolate. There is already a bright morning-blend coffee tone going on in regular Black Marlin, but here its more of a rich, dark espresso character. The American hop quality and slightly tangy finish of the original stuff is muted, here, in favor of more of that espresso. Espresso front to back.

Good flavor, but a slightly unpleasant aftertaste. Seems like it can't decide if it wants to be a stout or a porter

169,"2016-10-22",4.0,"This was poured into a nonic pint glass.
The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with an eggshell white foamy thin fingers worth of head. Lacing in rings, slightly sticky, subtle foaminess.
The aroma starts with some coffee bean bitterness and toastiness. Mocha and milk chocolate qualities provide a nice balance.
The flavor leans sweet with a nice touch of the bitterness of the coffee bean to balance. Mocha and chocolate grip the aftertaste nicely, semi-sweet and then leads into a sly sticky sweet sort of finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionability about it. Low carbonation. Moderate stickiness yet acceptable.
Overall, really nice porter leaning to some richer sweet qualities that make it a good standout for dessert.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Pours black with a small brown head. Aroma of black coffee: black, black, black coffee, followed by some chocolate, but obviously black coffee is the main aroma here.

Flavor is surprisingly smooth and easy (based on how strong that coffee aroma is). Black coffee fades into caramels, into creamy chocolates, into vanilla, into some light fruitness. Minor hints of ash in there as well. Holy shit this is good. And a bomber this cheap? Damn.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","hershiser2"
