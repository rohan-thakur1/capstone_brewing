3282,"2017-02-15",4.0,"750ml pour. Slightly translucent golden pour with half-inch of soapy head. Nose of Belgian esters, bready notes, a bit of apple, definitely notes of white-wine grapes. Smooth, crisp, full-bodied. Slightly sweet. Hard to believe this is 9%, no presence of the alcohol warmth at all. Gorgeous, and far-too-easy-drinking. May we meet again, surprise east-coast arrival.","Nova Scotia, CANADA","plaugher"
3282,"2016-12-31",3.7,"Bottled. The body is almost clear but a bit hazy with orange colors. The aroma is citrus, malt. The taste has wonderful flowery notes with a lovely sourness at the end.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Tranquillity"
3282,"2016-12-11",3.8,"750mL bottle, sent from wilco (thanks a lot, Mike), pours a hazy golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out bubblegum, candies sugar, and fruity esters. Flavour is on the dryer and more authentic side for a tripel, with candied sugar, bubblegum and Belgian yeast. Yeasty in a good way, with a fruity finish. Authentic for the style.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
3282,"2016-08-24",3.5,"Bottle, shared at RBAG by Robbie. Hazy medium gold. Ripe peaches, light banana, spicy yeast, fairly sweet but not cloying. For a style that Im rarely crazy about, this was nice.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"

3282,"2016-06-11",2.7,"Deep amber gold pour with a thin white head. The nose is spicy and slightly honeyed with a touch of bubble gum and a bit of a sticky sugary note. Sticky and cloying. A bit of slickness. Meh - I knew what this was when I bought it, and yet I did it anyway. Serves me right. Not good.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

3282,"2016-04-17",3.6,"Une bière mince et très pétillante, ça se voit, avec une limpidité parfaite et un corps dor brillant. Apparence tout à fait innocente. Le nez est plus agressif, un peu viné, du moins beaucoup de raisins verts et autres fruits acidulés. Au goût, cest plus complexe : fraises, pommes, raisins, sucre dorge, un peu de banane. Assez longtemps après la gorgée, on ressent une petite amertume. Lalcool se fait discret. Un brin trop sucrée, et trop axée sur les arômes fruités pour constituer un exemple à envier de la formule, mais ses nombreuses qualités la rendent fort agréable et somme toute réussie.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","lesifflebiere"
3282,"2016-04-12",3.6,"750 ml bottle from LCBO. Pours a lightly hazy, deep golden colour with decent-sized, lasting white head. Aroma is both sweet and dry with lots of tree fruit, white wine character, spices and herbs. Flavour has bright, modestly sweet, modestly tart apple, pear and peach with lots of dry vinous character, some fruity/spicy yeast character and a bit of a herbal note. Medium carbonation. Interesting one.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Spab"

3282,"2016-02-26",3.7,"Bottle: Poured a golden color ale with a large foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma of lightly sweet notes with some light dry vinous notes. Taste is a nice mix of sweet malt notes with some dry white wine notes and subtle oak notes with some light warming alcohol notes. Body is quite full with good carbonation with some alcohol notes being apparent. Solid take on the style with nice barrel-aging notes but alcohol and sweetness is a little nit too upfront.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"

Taste is of grapefruit and lightly sweet with more warming alcohol. Body is medium (could be fuller) and carbonation medium-high. Quite good but Im more than happy to drink only a small sample because of all the alcohol.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

3282,"2016-01-19",3.4,"Bottle from the LCBO. Struggled a bit to get that cork out...guess I need to work on that hand strength :). Golden and slightly copper pour with a thin white foam covering. Belgian yeast, some candied sugar, some chardonnay notes, moderate carbonation considering the pop on the cork, hints of sourness as things develop with a dry and semi-sweet finish.

3282,"2016-01-10",3.8,"Batch 4451, date 11/09/2015 and bottle no. 00636, in Champagne glass. Pours a hazy light-golden colour with a big white cap, good retention and foamy lacing. Fruity malt scent with some sweetness and Belgian Ale yeast. Much of the same for the taste. Was expecting Sparkling bubbles, but no. Not much carbonation. The closest to Champagne is the yeast, which adds nutty notes in the aftertaste. Maybe a little tart. I do really enjoy Tripels, so this one fits the bill for this. Quite enjoyable !","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"
3282,"2016-01-09",4.2,"Grass and bubblegum smell, floral, yeasty. Hazy beer, medium to full bodied, strong bready yeasty flavour, astringent, citrus like lime without acidity. Really nice, dry tasty beer.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Listigovers"
3282,"2016-01-09",3.8,"750 ml bottle from LCBO, served cold in a tulip glass. 
App.: Murky deep golden with a tight, rocky white froth.
 
Aroma: Bright lemony citrus, earthy/citrusy coriander, a little peppery, sweet and fruity, pretty good honey-like malt support, a little herbal, inviting.
 
Palate: Medium+ body, fairly full carbonation, fine, prickly bubbles.
 
Flav.: Wheat, bread dough, citrus, earthy coriander, honey, a little herbal, crackers/biscuits, celery tops, quite sweet; sweet with low-ish bitterness and a pleasant citrus, earthy, lightly spicy finish with some alcohol presence.

$16 is a lot for a bottle of beer. Im assuming the packaging contributed fairly substantially. The beer is pretty good though.","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"

3282,"2016-01-04",3.9,"750ml bottle. Poured in a champagne flute glass as recommended, has a good size foamy white head that slowly gives way to a thin cap and has a deep golden appearance. Fairly excessive carbonation. Aromas of yeast, wheats, sweet malts, herbal hops and some woodsy hints. Flavours are quite malty, has strong Belgian yeast notes, bready and sweet malts, some notes of oats and wheats. A little bit of sweetness from the cane sugar. Full bodied mouthfeel, drying sensation. Great retention. For a 9% abv beer, alcohol is very well hidden. Maybe a bit too pricey though.","Winchester, Ontario, CANADA","AleRider78"
3282,"2016-01-02",3.7,"Bouteille de 750ml.

- Couleur blonde dorée avec très peu d'effervescence.

- On sent les arômes de levures belges, de vin blanc et d'épices.

- Le goût est fidèle aux arômes, avec une petite touche funky.

- Au final, la New Lang Syne me fait penser à une Fin du Monde vieillie en barriques de vin blanc moins effervescente. Un bon goût de célébration en bouche. À partager entres célébrants.

3282,"2015-12-31",3.6,"Pours foggy gold with a small white pillow. Aroma is sweet honey and biscuit malt and light yeast. Taste is much the same, moderate carbonation. I was expecting a little more vigorous carbonation the way the cork popped but overall a good effort.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","cfrancis"
3282,"2015-12-31",4.0,"This bottle uncorked with a very loud pop and a considerable amount of smoke escaping the bottle, leaving me with the impression a gun had gone off in the room. The body is a murky, semi-filtered gold, and the white head is quickly dissipating.
There is a slight effervescence to the mouthfeel. The aromas and tastes are Belgian Yeast, white wine, peach, pear, under ripe mellon and black pepper.
Beaus gets into 750ml bottles and high abv. This was a fitting sipper for my New Years Eve.","","Randy4Beer"
3282,"2015-12-31",4.0,"Bottle from the LCBO. Very cloudy gold with a generous slow fading white head. Nose is yeast, Wood, white wine, a little bit of funk, some peach and some spice.

3282,"2015-12-31",3.7,"$16 bottle of beer. Price somewhat hurts a part of my soul, but I shell out for it anyway. Hope to share it with my old man on Xmas eve but end up opening it with Mrs Tiki on New Years Eve (she who could care less about beer but has an occasional fondness for Belgian styles). Peculiar beer. Unlike anything Ive had before. The white wine essence from the barrels is in the forefront without the sharp edge it often brings. Doesnt really come across as the listed style but Im not sure it intends to. Interesting champagne alternative. Share it with one of your fancy friends who prefer the grape over the hop & see how this one gets them thinking. Farewell to 2015 (great year for me personally, but damn what a messed up bloody & bombastic year this has been around the world).","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Freaky_tiki"
3282,"2015-12-23",3.8,"Beaus décide enfin de foncer pour vrai dans ce quils offrent au Québec! Il y a eu quelques Beaus que jai bien aimées (la ""Bush Fire"" particulièrement), mais cette brasserie me laisse trop souvent cette impression de produire des bières faciles, retenues, prévisibles. Avec la New Lang Syne, on entre dans un monde plus intéressant! Le style choisi est cependant un peu bizarre (Une triple belge, sans blague??), mais le résultat est tout de même efficace. On ressent bien le veillissement en fût de vin blanc... Ça manque peut-être un peu de punch comparé à dautres bières semblables, mais cest au bout du compte très réussi.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","electrotype"

3282,"2015-12-14",3.5,"0.75 bottle. Hazy, yellow color and a medium, white head. Aroma is rather sour, vinous to an extent, yeasty, floral, fruity. Taste is also sour though not as much, yeasty, floral, somewhat spicy. A medium body, an oily texture, and a lively carbonation. Finish is medium long and sweeter than the rest though it generally follows the same palette of flavors. Overall not a bad beer though a tad too yeasty and sour for me as compared to standard tripels.","Århus, DENMARK","KoNrRiI"
3282,"2015-12-14",3.8,"750ml, corked and caged. Slightly hazy golden pour, with a huge white head. Aroma is very yeasty, with huge tropical fruit notes. As it warms and mellows a strong peach aroma moves to the forefront, along with some nice woody, sligtly funky aromas. A very effervescent carb, and a nice mouth feel. The finish is lightly bitter with more fruit, strong yeast, slight minerals, some wet paper and grassy hops.","Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, CANADA","robinvboyer"
