86,"2017-05-26",3.9,"Its what youd expect if youve ever had Good Gourd Almighty and literally any beer aged in a bourbon barrel, where the bourbon kinda dominates the cool spice notes and wipes them away into an ocean of sweet boozy goodness. Whereas the brandy GGA works extraordinarily well as a reimagination of the beer, this is just the beer taking on a new, arguably lesser, dominant flavor.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
