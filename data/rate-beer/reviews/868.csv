868,"2015-03-04",3.3,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2015 Bottle (300 ml). Split 2-ways with the lady. Shaken as the instruction says.

Appearance: Looks like coconut milk. Cloudy with sediments floating.

Aroma: Alcohol at first (though its not massively boozy) with light fruitiness, overcooked rice, coconut notes and light fruitiness.

Taste: Alcohol, moderate fruitiness, moderate to medium sweetness, coconut water, rice and floral presence.

Palate: Medium body. Milky mouthfeel. A bit viscous too. Moderate warming finish. Mild lingering coconut. 

Overall: My first sake rating so take this with a grain of salt (even though a huge amount of ratings doesnt necessarily translate in good ratings, take czar for example, he is almost at 5K now and is still writing a bunch of BS)  [ EDIT ;-) ]. Interesting first try. The alcohol is well hidden. Not really easily drinkable, but somewhat tasty and enjoyable.

Can feel the particles on my tongue, a bit chalky. Light cedar notes as well. Some fresh flesh.  Very creamy and milky texture, like 2% fat milk. A bit alcohol forward for the abv.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
868,"2008-12-29",3.7,"300mL Bottle at Zen - Bucktown, Chicagio, IL. Served chilled. Soft plum alcohol and apple blossom. Wet. Pours a cloudy white. Light grainy rice sugar, alcohol. Apple flesh, light asian pear, and some sweet yeast esters. A bit of apricot and yeast. Nice. Quickening and vibrant. Not an overly complex or floral sake, but the deeper koji texture and notes add to the light, delicate character of this example.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
868,"2008-10-12",3.6,"Im starting off my experiment in sake with the most affordable bottles.  This is probably a bad idea.  If I did that with beer Id be an avowed teetotaler, but so far the experience has been very pleasant, in part thanks to the approachability of Hakutsurus delicious nigori-zake, Sayuri.  The pink bottle might throw you off.  The sake isnt pink nor are the flavors really pink.  This was almost disappointing.  Ive clashed with the Japanese love for artificial strawberry flavoring before.  The best strawberry milk in the world easily comes from Japan.  So I had expected something of a strawberry note in the Sayuri thanks to its roseate glow.  No such taste, Im afraid.  Underneath the thick blanket of creamy sediment (leaving a grittiness on the tongue that I rather enjoy) is mostly a musk melon sweetness, which lounges around the tongue until you decide to swallow it.  Then an alcohol burn leaps from the unassuming fruity flavor and toasts its way all the way down the esophagus.  In effect, the Sayuri is very contradictory - somehow light yet very milky, somehow sweet (melon and mochi) yet very strong in its alcohol notes.  The aroma is very difficult to catch, but mostly resembles the initial sweetness before the alcohol bite.  Hakutsurus Sayuri is a very pleasant drink and certainly a good way to ease into sake, especially if you have unconfirmed but curious drinkers as guests.  This seems like it would be the Lindemanns of sake.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

868,"2008-03-16",3.5,"300ml bottle from the LCBO. Pours a very cloudy white, nice. Aroma: At first, unpleasant nail polish, but, seconds later, that changes to honey-due melon, fruity sweetness, like sweetened milk. Very intriguing. Flavour: Surprisingly alcoholic, but not cloyingly so. Thick mouth-feel. Interesting, chalky fruitiness, with a rough bite to it. A nice sipper, and thankfully it hasnt scared me away from Sake, as this is my first example ever.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

Pours a milky white, with substantial almond-grape tones with a musty koji tone.

Full bodied for a sake, sweetish, fruity (melon) and creamy smooth. Sweetish-fruity finish with warming following.

868,"2007-02-18",3.5,"300mL Bottle: Pours a very thick milky white with moderate sized particulates. I really dig the bottle and label design, it conveys a very mature and deliberate persona. The nose is a bit fruity with very subtle alcohol along with the typical chalky rice and koji notes you get with a nigori. The sweetness accenuates the fruitiness in the nose and theres some watermelon and taro bubbletea notes. The flavor is... Well, lets start with the mouthfeel, its akin to milk with flour mixed in. Creamy and smooth, but a chalky and gritty quality that passes through your teeth noticably. The flavor is nice though; a delicate sweetness and alcohol seesaw. The acidity plays with the nihonshu-do like honey and lemon chasing each other around a grassy pasture. Nice sake, I was in the mood for something like this. For the cons, it could be a little thinner with less alcohol notes for only 12½%. Worse the warmer it gets. Nice nigori, especially for Hakutsuru.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
868,"2006-10-09",3.9,"Bottle purchased at Bevmo!, Sacramento-Natomas.  Bottle is a frosted, pink color with a very feminine label.  Aroma is lightly sweet, grainy, and a bit floral.  THere is a little bit of an ethanol presence retronasally.  Opaque, milky coconut milk color with no head, but a very nice legging with some fine particulars adhering to the sides of the glass.  A lightly sweet, spritzy effervessence greets the tongue to start.  Middle has some fruity presence, wildberries.  Flavor also tends to be quite floral as well.  A small ethanol presence comes through late and lends a warming sensation to this sake.  The mouthfeel is creamy and rich, just like a nigori should be.  I enjoyed this.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
