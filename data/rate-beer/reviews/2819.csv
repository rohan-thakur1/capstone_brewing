Huge thanks to Joenugs for the trade!Man, have I been dying to try this beer for a long time now....Pours a rich beeswax-golden, clear with a large amount of white head showing moderate retention.The nose is pretty close to perfection, showing strong white grape, pommelo, fresh cut grass and biscuits loaded with honey. Smells like the best qualities of Nelson Sauvin (mineral, white grape must, red grapeskin) mixed with the best noble hop qualities (fresh cut grass, lavender, almost Brett-like citrics), despite there being no Nelson Sauvin actually present. Clean and with no alcohol.Crisp, well-attenuated with a tinge of rich maltiness in the form of plentiful honey and light whitebread. Hints of sourdough transition in to more white grape and zesty fresh herbal notes from the hops, as lemon and grass linger on the crisp, tightly carbonated finish.

Malt is baked crackers, warm bread, lightly toasty, good expression though muted by the hoppiness. Medium-light bodied, near-perfect flavor balance, moderate to light sweetness, medium bitter, creamy fine carbonation with satisfyingly release mid-palate.

2819,"2014-10-12",3.8,"GABF 2014 Rating (Denver, CO). Pours a pale straw yellow hue, faint haziness, frothy bright white layer of head sticks around, laces well enough. Aromas are bitter and earthy, touches of leafy green hops, some spiciness, touches of straw, gentle dough. Fresh, a touch bitter with mellow Pils malt sweetness and dryness. Initial is a bit bitter, floral with decent spicy hops. Touches of earth, soap, floral hop bitterness into the middle. Some bread, firm green earthy hops, touches of soap, spice and grass. Mellow bread, faint honey kiss. Some dough, gentle straw. Finish is dry and bitter, gentle spice. Refreshing, quite drinkable with a firm bitter hop classic profile.

2819,"2014-10-05",3.6,"On tap at the brewery. 
Aroma is full of a nice grainy character. Moderate floral and light fruity hop notes. 
Pours a clear, pale, yellow gold with a thick white head that exhibits nice retention. High lacing and no legs. 
Flavor had some nice, slightly sweet grain notes with a bit of a white bread character. Medium light bitterness with a hint of some fruit esters. Light floral and grass hop notes.
Mouthfeel is medium light to light bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a pretty nice American pilsner. The water might be a bit off and it seems slightly less bitter than I would expect but it tastes really nice and lacks any corn character.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
2819,"2014-09-26",3.7,"Sample, clearish golden color with good but of carbonation and bitterness. Notes of corn pops, hops, malt, grains, grass, light ash and earth. Easy going and nice but I mostly stuck with the dankery on tap this time around. Pretty dry in the finish.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
2819,"2014-09-20",3.9,"Draft at the brewpub. Clear bright yellow color with lively bubbles. Excellent grassy and piney aroma. Dry and crisp with a good pilsner flavor. Grains and grass. Fuller body than is typical for the style with lively carbonation. Solid attempt at the style from Russian River.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
2819,"2014-08-26",4.0,"Light flower aroma with slight evergreen notes. Golden yellow color, effervescent with a lingering head. Malty front with a hop bite at the end. Hops lingers briefly then disappears in time for the next sip. Great on a warm day.","Virginia, USA","nasmith003"
2819,"2014-08-17",3.9,"Growler. Thanks, C! What an awesome treat! Pours a very slightly hazy straw yellow with a sudsy white head that goes away, but it takes a while. Lots of stringy lace. Big grassy nose, very much like a bright green lawn on a nice summer day. Creamy light body with bright carb. Herbaceous grassy notes on the mid palate with toasty crisp crackery notes. Crisp dry finish.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

2819,"2014-08-16",3.5,"Draft at the source, Clear piss yellow color, good head retention. Aroma is citrus, Saaz grassy hops and mild grain. It is difficult for me to get excited for a Pilsner but this is a pretty nice brew. True example of the style, light bitterness, light body with a clean grain finish. Carbonation gives a tingle over the tongue and light sweet grain notes. 
 I had Heater Allen just an hour after this at BeerCraft, glad I had a strong example to compare it against.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2819,"2014-08-02",3.8,"On tap at the brewery. It pours a clear gold color with a white head. The aroma is citrus forward with some fresh grains, lemongrass and menthol. The flavor is grainy with heavy notes of menthol, pine and florals. Strong bitterness. The body is crisp for a higher gravity pils and pretty refreshing. The hop character is brutish for the style as expected, but still pretty tasty.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
