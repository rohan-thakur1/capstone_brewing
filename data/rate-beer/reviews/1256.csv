1256,"2007-07-12",4.5,"You better believe I was psyched when this cask showed up at Redbones on 6/12/07.  This was the only English beer I missed at this years cask festival.Just an ever-so-slight haziness to it, with a soft lemon-lime tinted golden body and a cascading, white/off-white head that is impeccably well retained and completely douses the glass in lace.  While the haziness is slight, I just cant bring myself to give it a 4Even out of a shaker, this stuff just pours on the fresh, aromatic, juicy dry-hopping and wonderfully attenuated malts that are dripping with light honey and fresh woodiness.  Incredibly high strength of aroma.  The hops just continue on endlessly and theres a bit of crunchy/crackery-like maltiness to give it a little oomph.  Definitely a strong house yeast character, kind of reminds me of moldy bread, or damp basements, but in a good way, if thats possible.  Flawless, as well.Succulent, in a word, is the flavor, with no overdone bitterness, yet certainly a boatload of hoppiness.  Orange peel, lemons, limes, white grapefruit and light melon, it unfolds upon a backbone of angelfood cake-like sweetness, yet with the same delicate, aerated mouthfeel.  Some dustiness, woodiness and hints of quasi-funky house yeast all complete the picture, giving it that extra jab of character that makes well-done English beers that much more enjoyable and unique.  Simply stunning and flawless of course.  I could see giving this a perfect score, but perhaps the hoppiness could be toned down a little and the malt balance/complexity improved somewhat.  As well, Id like to see it just a touch more dry and with less dextrine comfort on the palate.  Minor complaints though, this stuff is marvelous.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1256,"2007-07-06",4.2,"Cask. Pours a lightly hazy deep gold, which is further accentuated by a foamy, rocky white head that recedes slowly and imparts fine sheet lacing. The aroma is wonderful. Grassy and earthy hops take center stage, followed by plenty of caramel and dusty malts, lightly toasted grains, apple skins, gym locker, orange pith, grapefruit pulp and light stale notes. All these aromatic compounds, including the stale ones, lend to a well-rounded and enticing nose. Alcohol is undetectable. No DMS, no diacetyl, excellent. The flavor is moderately bitter, lightly to moderately acidic, with minor funk emerging. Sweetness from malt is pleasantly counterbalanced by toast and biscuit malt notes. This is really delicious and has far exceeded my expectations, which were rather high to begin with. The mouthfeel is lowly carbonated, soft, quenching, light-medium to medium bodied. Finishes citric, lightly acidic, with grapefruit and orange notes lingering. This is a fantastic morphed recipe of traditional English cask bitter and mildly aggressive American pale ale. A real treat I hope to enjoy again soon. Underrated.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

1256,"2007-05-11",3.9,"Cask at Hop Devil. Pale pour with great lacing. Not quite sure Id go as far as to call this ""insanely hoppy,"" but there is definitely a big PNW hop presence, especially for a british beer. Great citrus notes in this, and the body is fantastic. Goes down really, really easily.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
1256,"2007-04-25",3.6,"handpull at Maxs.  A great, well balanced bitter. refreshing to taste in the states. I didnt detect the ""insane hop aroma"", but I did get a lot of citrus with a slamming maltiness. Fruity and fun. Leaves you wanting more.","Beertimore, Maryland, USA","Holdwine"
1256,"2007-03-16",4.0,"Cask handpull at Market Porter, Southwark.  Gold colour with lasting off whtie head.  Trademark Oakhams hoppiness, citric.  Very good malt in mouth and then sherberty grapefruit hoppy finish.  Utterly drinkable, bit of cat pee at worst.  Clean, smooth fullish in mouth.  Its Oakhams and I love it.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
1256,"2007-03-14",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 14, 2010 Cask conditioned - handpump - Out Of The Vaults Leicester.  A golden coloured beer (not sure why Oakham would describe it as amber) with a nice white head and lacing.  The aroma is hoppy with oranges and grapefruit.  The taste is more of the same.  Citricity abounds but theres a decent malty base as well which sets it apart from some of the hoppy stuff Oakham puts out.  Lots of citrus in the aftertaste.  Very nice.  Score 3.7Subsequent rating also scored 3.7. Score unaltered","Wootton, Northampton, Northamptonshire, ENGLAND","maeib"
