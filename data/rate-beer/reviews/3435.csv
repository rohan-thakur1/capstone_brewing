They all fight to be the main aroma here, Id say its mostly dark chocolate and molasses, but the other aromas complement this very well. Very sweet with some roasted tartness and cocoa bitterness.

3435,"2016-10-19",5.0,"From notes. Enjoyed this as part of the long-anticipated Toppling Goliath Brouhaha with Travis, Chris, Doug, and Ryan at Traviss house on September 24. Gold-waxed, 2014 vintage, 12 oz bottle shared by me. The pour is a thick and heavy dark black with a thin ring of dark mocha colored head that leaves no trace. This thing just sticks to the glass. Its amazing. The aroma is unbelievable. The balance of heavy maple, chocolate, vanilla fudge, molasses, coffee, dark fruits, molasses, and brown sugar is just amazing. The bourbon barrel adds a wonderful oaky complexity and a hint of bourbon that really ties all of this together. The flavor is equally as amazing. The chocolate and vanilla fudge right up front are spectacular, and the maple comes rolling in with the dark fruits, sweet molasses, coffee, and brown sugar. The bourbon holds off, but remains detectable in each aspect. The balance is great. The mouth feel is unlike anything Ive had. Period. This is so thick and viscous, you think you might actually be drinking syrup. The carbonation is soft and velvety with a lingeringly maple, coffee, chocolate/vanilla fudgey, light bourbon bounty of liquid sex. Jesus H. This is everything a beer should be.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3435,"2016-03-16",4.6,"Bottle from mid-2013, drank early 2016. The aroma can be smelled across the room: maple syrup, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, buttery oak, coconut, butterscotch, a little black licorice. Very sugary, very rich, very deep. Legs for days--a swirl makes the liquid stick to the sides of the glass. Flavor is incredibly rich and sweet: sticky vanilla bean, chocolate covered cherries, plums, fruity coffee beans. Mildly bitter toasty oak mid-palate, along with graham cracker. Dark chocolate swoops in and coats the tongue at the swallow. Finishes quite tangy and fruity, though heavy roast settles in long after. Creamy, sugary, syrupy, thick.

Pours a viscous, motor oil black color, with a small dark brown head, soon collapsing to a tiny ring of lacing with some spider web in the middle of the glass. Leaves back a mix of tiny tubbles and an oily texture after swirling.

Although I opened this after more than a year of its release, the coffee is as dominant as it has been in fresh Mornin Delight. In this though, the Bourbon adds to the complexity of the coffee, creating an unforseen richness of aromas on the nose, while maple syrup appears to be a bit muted. There is a luscious bakers chocolate quality in this, tying the oaken barrel and flowery, cold pressed coffee beautifully together, creating a spicy coffee bean decadence, amped up by a mix of molasses and syrup. Coffee itself has an earthen note to it, perfectly enhanced by the barrel, while vanilla blends into scorched malts, producing an intense, wood accompanied, spicy praline impression.

I cannot belive the mouthfeel on this is real. This is unbelievable smooth. Rich and creamy, while featuring one of the most intense tasting beers Ive ever had. Its silkness remains throughout, soothing the warmer parts of the beer with whipped cream and just an unbelievable softness.

Tastes of fudge, earth and brownie batter right from the beginning, together with a sweet and bitter cold pressed coffee appearance, adding foremost a roasty quality to the taste. While the flavors evolve rapidly on the palate, its silk creaminess calmes the upcoming flavor onslaught, leaving everything enjoyable and detectable. Milk chocolate and cocoa nibs set on top of the outstanding creaminess, finding their counterpart in roasty malts and a genuine coffee bitterness, blending into earth. Has a hot peak, together with a flowery barrel dryness, while licorice and a rich chocolate coating, calm the well accentuated, spicy heat. Finishes surprisingly clean and soft, right after the short, burning glimpse, whipped cream works its magic, ensuring the beers world class mouthfeel, while complimenting its chocolate richness. Coates the tongue during the aftertaste, together with gently spiced vanilla and coconut bark, packing also a lingering dryness.

This beer is beautiful throughout, it is indeed perfect. What I loved most about Mornin Delight was its outstanding mouthfeel, but this one puts it to shame, by revealing a chewy smoothness, I have never experienced before in a beer. Its taste features a certain ambivalence, on the one hand it drinks fairly easy, due to its unreal silkness, while on the other hand it packs an unbelievable flavor range with a perfectly nuanced intensity to it. Everything seems to be in perfect balance, while maple syrup gets partially replaced by the far more complex Bourbon barrel in comparison to the MD. I understand this beer is highly sought after, this time it is most certainly well deserved.","GERMANY","aleigator"

The bourbon does take over, though. Bourbon taste is sharp. Coffee comes out here. Dark chocolate. Maple comes out in the back. Sweetness lingers. Bourbon flavor lingers also. Very thick. Boozy.

3435,"2015-07-13",4.4,"12-oz. 2014 (gold wax) bottle graciously opened by Dustin on his birthday and shared with JPDurden24 and djd07. The nose is more smokey than I anticipated and also features sweet and boozy bourbon, medium coffee, decadent chocolate, toffee, light cinnamon, very roasted barley, and the briefest spicy touch of charred adobo. Its flat black in color with a dark tan ring head. Wow, smooth doesnt begin to describe the taste. Chocolate is the primary flavor and is accompanied by velvety bourbon, dry cinnamon with a slightly woody finish. The rich syrup lends only sweetness at first without any distinct maple taste, but it increases greatly as the beer warms to eventually become the dominant flavor. The body is a tiny thin for an imperial stout. Its a beautiful beer, but I wouldnt consider it the best barrel-aged stout Ive tried.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"

3435,"2015-04-09",4.3,"Bottle (12 oz). 2014 vintage. From Brian, thanks! Split 4-ways.

Appearance: Pitch black with a small very dark brown head, little lacing and some legs. 

Aroma: Theres a burst of coffee at first followed by a really fruity presence and rich caramel/toffee. Theres also some spices/cinnamon, bourbon, vanilla, brandy (might just be the fruits though) and fudge. 

Taste: Quite sweet, but well balanced by the coffee acidity. Rich caramel/toffee presence, lots of coffee here too, quite fruity, bourbon, mild spices/cinnamon presence and fudge.

Palate: Full body. Medium carbonation. Thick and silky mouthfeel. Lingering caramel, coffee and fruity finish. Nice alcohol warmth. 

Overall: Excellent barrel-aged RIS. The malt depth is impressive and its extremely flavorful and tasty which I guess helps to get some very high ratings from small pours. I liked it a lot, but I didnt enjoyed it nearly as much as GI Rare (which stunned me when I had it 2 years ago) or Double Black on tap (which was as tasty and more drinkable - yeah no kidding - despite being listed as more than twice the abv of this one).","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

The dark chocolates give off hints of oak/bourbon, but not much. Coffee dominates this nose. The taste (finally!) has the loads of coffee that you would expect, but digs deep to give you plenty of character. Bakers chocolates graham cracker, charred marshmallow....taste like smores!

3435,"2013-10-01",4.7,"Bottle 230/300 poured into snifter after having 15 minutes on the counter to warm from the fridge. 

A- Pours a viscous pitch black with a dark brown/mocha head about 1/4 inch high with insane retention for a stout. Detectable carbonation bubbles, but on the low side, as appropriate for style. Over two minutes, the head fades to a mocha ring around the edges of the glass. 

S- Mother of god- this smells like Vermont maple syrup aged in a bourbon barrel, dipped in chocolate, and wrapped with the tears of angels. Honestly though, the syrup sweetness with the wood notes really dominate, although the bourbon notes are just hanging out behind them. 

T- Maybe I am just riding the hype train, but this tastes absolutely amazing. A huge sweet maple sugar (think the little maple butter candies you can buy up in Vermont) followed by a super mellow bourbon barrel character mixed in with chocolate, caramel, and a balancing roast and bitter note. 

M- Thick. A bit more carbonation than I expected for this, but it works well with the beer. This is an oil slick of a beer, as it should be for the style. This is definitely a sipper, but I could (and will) drink a full 12 ounces in one sitting happily. 

O- This is by far the best tasting and smelling beer I have ever experienced. Insanely good, better than BAVDL and BCBS rare in my opinion. I am actually a bit upset I decided to open this bottle, because I dont know if I will ever get it again. I guess I will be at the release if they release it in the future!","","justforrazors"

3435,"2013-09-08",4.7,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2014 9/7/13Huge thanks to my buddy Matt for sharing this awesome bottle. Aroma pancakes breakfast. Not maple, maple plus pancakes, maybe some cinnamon. The mouthfeel is perfect balance between thickness and carbonation. Taste has the perfect amount of bourbon but was not in the aroma. Bit of maple and chocolate. And coffee, but the coffee was really in the back or rather perfectly mixed. I really like coffee bombs, I guess it could have used more coffee in this but that might have thrown it off. Because everything really is perfectly balanced. No burn at all. Tried this at an amazing tasting up against some of my favorite ba stouts and this was the best. We opened BC Coffee (my previous #1) right after this and it didnt even come close.  Even later in night trying Rare and Murdad Out, this still stood out as the best.  Fuck man, amazing.

2014 vintage, on 10/18 at the Malloy tasting, thanks steve, reminded again if how good this is. More maple than I remember. Ton of coffee, not much bourbon, maybe just covered by the intense coffee and maple. Either way amazing. This and vanilla darklord are my top 2. And Im not sure if I could settle that debate without a best of 7 head to head.

11/22/14 13v14. Still amazing as it gets. Intense coffee, maple and bourbon. 14 is a little more sweeter and just has all around bolder flavors. I thought it was better fresh, although it was a split decision between the group.  Not much drop off on it.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"

M- light carbonation supports a full body and a smooth, oily full palate. T- tangy cacao, coffee, burning alcohol and vanilla get you going up front. More sugary maple syrup, dried fruits, marshmallows, fudge, mocha and molasses form a sweet and solid middle. Some tangy hints of overripe apples and bing cherries. Whiskey persists throughout.

The flavor is again huge and rich... The coffee is really well done here bringing a nice big roasty character with a mild bitterness. There are some really nice sweeter flavors of raisin, fudge, & maple but its got some nice dark bitter chocolate as well. The vanilla and oaky elements from the bourbon are well presented.

Pours a deep brown, not quite opaque, with amber edges and a tiny dark tan head that settles quickly into a ring. The barrel notes blast immediately from the aroma- vanilla, brown sugar, whiskey, coffee, maple syrup, caramel, and oak. Layers and layers of sweetness and roast. Same can be said for the flavor, with maple syrup, coffee, brown sugar, vanilla, oak, roasted malts, and cocoa beans. Medium-bodied - thinner than Mornin Delight for sure - with modest carbonation and a warm, sweet, roasty mouthfeel. The sweetness isnt overwhelming here, nor are any other notes. Theyre all big but dont push one another out of the way or offend the palate. Man, this is good.

3435,"2013-07-01",4.5,"Bottle Thanks Hopscotch - Pours dark black with slight brownish head, little retention. Smells of oak, maple, vanilla, bourbon, and coffee. Taste of maple syrup, bitter dark chocolate, and coffee. Pretty good!!!

3435,"2013-07-01",4.8,"Bottle and on tap... reviewed from notes on both, and no discernable differences between them. Pours a thick, heavy black body with a nice deep khaki head. Light lacing. Smell is full of sticky maple bourbon and coffee, a light toffee and roasted char. Really incredible aroma. An even more impressive taste, full of butterscotch, coffee, and smooth roast. Some maple. and vanilla bourbon. So decadent. Surprisingly drinkable given the richness of the flavors. Mild carbonation, and this lingers on your palate for a long time. Simply, this is the best stout Ive ever had, and personally preferred to BVDL.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","cfrances33"
3435,"2013-07-01",5.0,"I wasnt a big fan of Morning Delight. Its a good enough beer, but like fudge, there is only so much you can consume before it is overwhelming. Throw that in a barrel however, and something magical happens. All of the big coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and maple syrup flavors that MD has, but the whiskey addition cuts the intense sweetness and rounds everything out. Amazing beer. For sure one of the best imperial stouts Ive ever had.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","levifunk"
3435,"2013-06-25",5.0,"Bottle 84 of 300. Shared with my beer buddy daknole, yes that daknole :-). If there was a perfect barrel aged stout it would be this. Unbelievably complex. Coffee, vanilla, maple, oh my. Top 2 or 3 stouts all time.","Alabama, USA","thebitterendaz"
3435,"2013-06-25",5.0,"Black pour, brown head. Liquid fucking gold in the aroma. Maple, pancakes, chocolate, vanilla, coffee...flavored? Jesus. Smores, cafe mocha, incredible and I mean incredible. Fuck. Thanks to TheAlum. Oh my.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
3435,"2013-06-14",4.6,"Bottle from Toppling Goliath, pours a nice brown coffee pour with a nice orangish brown head that quickly fades. Aroma of coffee, whiskey, chocolate, molasses and some syrup. Taste is some syrup and chocolate, whiskey definitely breaks through in the finish and heats the throat. This is a solid beer, not sure I can pick a winner between the two.

3435,"2013-06-13",4.6,"(12oz bottle, courtesy of brystmar)  Pours an opaque black body with a medium brown head.  Aroma of bourbon, toffee, burnt marshmallow, Indian curry, caramel, Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies, toasted coconut, vanilla, bourbon, and dark chocolate.  Flavor of chocolate, bourbon, caramel, toffee, maple, roasted malt, coffee, and vanilla.   Incredibly tasty.","Frisco (Dallas), Texas, USA","bu11zeye"
3435,"2013-06-12",4.7,"(12oz bottle thanks to brystmar) espresso brown, dark tan bubbles, coats the glass as well as any. Nose of rich cream, extremely good coffee, biscotti cookies, bourbon, coconut, so rich and decadent.I wont be able to describe it to remember it. Taste of rich coconut, light alcohol, cream, bourbon, vanilla, complex as anything you can imagine. Medium to thick body, coats the mouth in a way I cant describe. Wow.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
3435,"2013-06-12",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 21, 2013 As soon as I cracked this cap, the room was filled with luscious bourbon, roasted malts; caramel; and impressively pungent, high end coffee. Jesus, this smells amazing. 

Taste follows suit: roasty initially before bourbon and coffee interrupt everything and take center stage. Impeccably rounded overall profile. Rivals the very best stouts Ive ever tasted. World class status is merely implied after the first sip. 

And Kentucky Brunchs body coats the mouth unlike almost anything else Ive tasted. The Pegs stouts are its only peers in this category. 

Holy moly, this is better than Mornin Delight... and that isnt said lightly. Toppling Goliath killed it. Again.  
Update: So its been a week, and Ive decided to upgrade my rating to a perfect 5.  I previously gave it 4/5 on appearance (which is incorrect upon looking at my picture of it afterwards; was trying to be overly picky at the time) and 19/20 for a total of 4.8.  However, Ive been thinking about this nonstop for the last week and feel comfortable saying that KBBS is a perfect beer.  Its arguably the best brew Ive ever smelled, tasted, and enjoyed on the palate, and that makes it a 5.  Hats off to the TG guys: Kentucky Brunch truly is a masterpiece.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"
3435,"2013-06-06",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2015 Thick oily pour
Smells like cold brewed coffee and vanilla / coconut. Huge lactose and sweet sugary nose of maple syrup
Taste. Holy crap! What in the hell is this? Is this heaven in a glass? Ive never ever. Shit. Oozes of layers of maple, bourbon, coffee and sweet sugar. Finish is vanilla and sweet lovely maple that sits alongside this creamy fresh brewed espresso. Just incredible. 

THIS is the baseline that all stouts should be compared to. One of the greatest tasting works of art Ive ever had.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
3435,"2013-06-02",4.4,"Draft on tap at Kentucky Brunch Release (Decorah, IA). Pours a rich thick deep black hue, opaque and thick, a frothy brownish head atop dies to a creamy ring, laces ok. Good dark ominous body, good legs. Aromas offer maple and coffee, sticky caramel and some vanilla. Roast, toast, and toffee. Maple syrup, gentle oak, vanilla, and faint whiskey wafting. Its cold, so some warmth should open this up more. Initial is thick and sweet, touches of maple, oak, and cocoa. Sticky caramel, dark roast is mellow grows as it warms. The coffee comes out a bit more roast, a good intensity up front as it trails off, firm presence in the middle. Sticky and firmly flavored, roasty with good vanilla, barrel flavor as we round the corner. Vanilla, coffee, sticky caramel. Toffee, espresso, and richer coffee as we round up, a bit more roasty, sticky, barrel flavor. The base is still thick and firm, not making this pick up much if any heat from the barrel. Oak, roasty, and coffee. I think this is much more drinkable than the Mornin Delight. Its sweet, but not nearly as much. Thick and full, but not overwhelming. The coffee element comes on at just the right time. Really well put together. I prefer this to Mornin, which may just be sensory overload. This one is the gem. Finish is luscious espresso, oak and chewy sweetness, roast. Really nice experience. Damn impressive.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3435,"2012-02-13",4.7,"Tap at TG.  Incredibly rich aroma - tons of fresh coffee, like stuffing your nose in a bag of freshly roasted, oily beans.  Lots of chocolate, some caramel, a touch of dark fruits, roasty,  slight alcohol note.  The barrel notes are a bit subtle to me, but add a slight whiskey character and some complexity.  Pours jet black, opaque, thin brown head lingers for a minute, slight lacing.  Flavor follows the nose - massive dose of espresso, lots of rich chocolate, nice roast character, bitterness helps balance the big malt profile but is not aggressive.  Alcohol is pleasantly warming and generally well hidden, again some complexity and whiskey notes from the barrel.  Fairly sweet brew but not cloying, moderately bitter, fairly sweet/rich finish.  Very full body, chewy, velvety texture, low-medium carbonation.  Killer brew, absolutely fantastic.","Iowa, USA","ekoerper"
