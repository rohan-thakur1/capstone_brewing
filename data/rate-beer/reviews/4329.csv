The barrel is there, creamy texture, hefe/wheat vibe more than strong ale, banana, generic bubble-gum, a bit of white wine.. Taste is there, not my version of a strong ale..

4329,"2016-01-21",4.0,"Bottle. Nice boozy barrel notes on nose. Pours a murky-ish light brown. Great malt profile (Maris Otter should get a run more often). The barrel-aging has worked a treat, with the cut-through from the Grappa elevating this well above a typical strong ale. This is an excellent example of worthwhile collaboration.","Fitzroy, AUSTRALIA","Samma"
4329,"2016-01-08",3.9,"Apparently contains naked oats, (Australian) Bush Tomatoes, Muntries (a native berry thats a bit like a spicy apple) and is aged in an old Grappa barrel. Not obviously an English Strong Ale. Not that I have a better filing suggestion.

Bottle. Clear gold - a thick coat of sediment remains adhered to the bottle - with a white head thats soon less than a coat. Aroma of funky cider and white grape focaccia, but I guess theres some toasty malt there too. Full bodied but not heavy, sweet with straightforward but quality pale malt underpinning the apple and grape notes. Not much if any bitterness, but a musty astringency balances the sweetness. Some spices - mace, other Chinese ""medicine""- like things I cant place. Theres an odd pulpy woodiness to it too. Theres a ""things that lived in the barrel but dont mean to intrude"" feel thats really nice now. I wonder whether it will stay that way or take over. Interesting, good, highly original.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
