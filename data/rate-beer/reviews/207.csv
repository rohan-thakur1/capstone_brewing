207,"2016-08-04",3.9,"Bottle my wife picked up at BevMo in Sacramento. Rating #3800! Pours out a clear golden with short lived airy head. Big grainy nose, bread, hay. Taste follows the aroma, mouth feel is slick, a Nd had a nice weight and feel. Minor bite at the finish. Closest Ive had to the real thing.","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"

207,"2014-10-27",1.9,"Drank from a bottle in a kolsch glass. The beer had great appearance brilliant clear straw color, nice head, good lacing. The aroma and taste had a very strong sulfur note. The sulfur was harsh and aggressive reminiscent of rotten eggs and not just a subtle background note. Also quite sweet on the finish and not as dry as I would have liked overall.","","mosshorns"
207,"2014-10-15",3.5,"On tap at Junkyard, Nottingham on 8 October 2014. Straw colour. Slight haze. A bit restrained in the aroma but nice and clean on the palate. Rather grassy. Very refreshing. Good stuff. Maybe a little too much flavour for an ""authentic"" Kolsch - in fact, as it was listed on the board simply as Ruhstaller Exquisite I didnt initially realize it was a Kolsch. More hop character than would be traditional but, hey ho, thats fine by me.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

207,"2013-10-12",4.5,"This Kolsch, true-to-style, exhibits both ale and lager characteristics. Biscuity pale malt flavor, subtle fruity ale yeast esters with mild hop profile. Nicely balanced. A great American interpretation of a classic German Kolsch!","Corrales, New Mexico, USA","maltman53"
207,"2013-10-05",3.7,"~Bready malt aroma with berry fruitiness.
~Pours a very clear light golden color with small white head that disappears.
~Bready taste with pleasant spicy hoppiness and sulfury.
~Medium light bodied with high CO2, lingering spicy hop finish.
~refreshing. Easy to drink and quite tasty. I wish some of the fruitier notes came out more in the flavor. Im rating this from a bottle, but I had it on draft and remember it being better on draft.","Lincoln, California, USA","Oscbert"
207,"2013-08-30",3.8,"Bottle from Capitol Beer, Sacramento. Pours clear blonde with a very nice white head and a floral aroma. There is a clean light malt flavor with a mildly bitter finish. Quite refreshing and tasty.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
207,"2013-08-18",3.4,"Bomber at Taylors Market in Sacramento, CA. Pours clear light gold with a small creamy white head. Aroma is bready with a bit of citrus. Med body, almost. Flavor is bready and the hop is very interesting. It seems noble like kolsch from Koln, but ... The overall hop finish brought the very, very old Olympia beer into my head. Or at least what my head remembers from a spring day in 1960! Finishes bready and arguably more tastily hopped than a number of kolsches from Koln. Doesnt that resonate!","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
207,"2013-08-14",3.7,"Poured one finger of head on a clear, light yellow colored body.
The aroma is pleasant. Dry grain with a touch of lemon.
The taste is nice: mild lemon bitterness, a hint of malt sweetness. Simple but good.
The texture is crisp with moderate carbonation. 
A tasty beer for a warm California day.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"
207,"2013-08-12",4.3,"Aroma is clean lager. Some light fruitiness like passion fruit or mangos? Its light and tropicaly fruity, very nice for the summer. Palate is clean and finishes with the fruitiness, not the graininess some kolsches finish with. Very good, probably my favorite kolsch!","West Sacramento, California, USA","thetmaxx"
