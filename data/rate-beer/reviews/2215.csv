2215,"2013-11-09",3.3,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2014 When I think of Oktoberfest beers German style I think of lager like beers, so nothing to interesting. I was not expecting to much but I had to try it knowing that this breweries IPA ""Ten Bitter Years"" was a fantastic beer, had to see what else this brewery is up to.  Dont buy this beer expecting anything crazy compared to other types of beer out there, but for the beer style I think its a great beer, and really good for session beers.","Ontario, CANADA","HipHopOpotamus"
2215,"2013-11-04",3.6,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2013 650ml bottle from LCBO.
Pours a crystal clear copper orange with a one finger, lively, off-white head that quickly thins to a thick film. Mild lacing on the glass.
Aroma has notes of bread paired with caramel and slight earthy hops.
Taste is malt forward but balanced well with a medium bitter. Bready, bitter, semi dry finish accompanied by a touch of caramel and a earthyness.
Medium body and carbonation. Really clean in the mouth with a slight syrupy texture that keeps it from being to boring and watery.
Overall Im really liking this. Well balanced and well done. Would be great to pick up a few bottles of this for a Thanksgiving dinner. Will buy again for sure.
Cheers!","Barrie, Ontario, CANADA","sudomorph"

2215,"2011-10-23",3.2,"Deep amber-orange pour. Tight white head. The aroma is lightly sour with a touch of soft vanilla as well. Moderate Munich malt sweetness along with a touch of fruit that is kind of unwanted. A touch estery and chewy. Medium-bodied with a little bit of toffee as well. Its actually fairly hoppy though and the hops are more UK than German. Odd brew- this is. 

---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhoneEarlier Rating: 10/22/2011 Total Score: 3.5Tap at the Rebel House.  Copper coloured pour with a tight and sticky head. The aroma is appropriately malty with lots of Munich malt toastiness. Light noble hops along with a touch of fresh bread crust. Good balance although its initially quite carbonic tasting. Better than the ratings would suggest.

Nice nose of toasty malts, caramel, noble hops, some breadyand dough like aromas meet spices and wood. Tastes quite malty, sweet with a nice balance of floral hops. Toasted malts are the main flavour contender with a marked fruitiness, reminiscent of prune. I like this like I said, I think it needs a bit more heft to contend with the heavier, more traditional Marzens, but this is certainly the best Marzen coming from Canada, and one of the best Ive had.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"
2215,"2009-11-23",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2009 Bottle fresh from brewery:

Pours an amber-orange with a decent  2 finger tight cap. Fair retention and lacing.

Aroma is right on profile for the style: Malty-bready with toasty tones and low sweetness, woody noble hop aromas light earthiness.

Taste is hop forward with the toast malts sitting below a herbal-oak-woody noble hop profile, goes slightly dry in the finish with light bitterness and a light toasty-bready after taste.

a GOOD boilerplate Oktoberfest Marzen but to put it over the top the body  and malts need to be bulked up and come forward with the hops sitting just below the malts, should be 6% abv or better...If that were done this would be a GREAT Canadian Marzen and rated in the 4+ range....just the same, this is a welcome offering for a marzen starved local market.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

I tried this beer on October 23, 2009 at ""The Beerbistro"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  This was Daynas Beer of the day, kegged at the brewery on October 21st, and tapped at the restaurant on the 23rd.  The beer poured a translucent red with a tan foamy head.  The aroma was sweet malt, some fruit tones, and grain.  The mouthfeel was creamy, medium-bodied with medium-high carbonation.  The flavour was slightly sweet, and definitely malty.  A very enjoyable Oktoberfest and another fine product from the Black Oak Brewery.","Milton, Ontario, CANADA","cyrenaica"

Thin, acidic mouthfeel, dry and astringent, bitter and a bit harsh in the linger - seemed a bit unmeshed, I didnt dig it much - I hope Ken brings it to the Volo event later in October, I would like to try it again.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
