1534,"2017-05-05",3.6,"To Ã–lÂ’s take on the old American wheat ale style and one that apparently made it into the top-50 in its category here, physically made in Belgium; curious to see what this Danish gypsy brewery made of a very American Â’craftÂ’ style pioneered by AnchorÂ’s Summer Wheat in 1984. Medium thick, regularly shaped, off-white, moussy head leaving behind an intricate pattern of Â’paperÂ’ lacing and in the middle, falling apart into an equally intricate Â’Brugse kantÂ’-like, flat island; lightly hazy, Â’old goldÂ’ robe with warm orangey tinge, with a Â’fogÂ’ of yeast bits everywhere, turning equally misty and deeper orange-ish with sediment. Fragrant and rather Â’dankÂ’ aroma of lime flesh, lightly toasted white bread, fresh dill, butter on the brink of turning rancid but not quite, cream cheese, ripe starfruit, lemon zest, apricot, soap, tulips, cooked pumpkin flesh, very creamy potato mash, very vague hints of banana, minerals, iron, cloves and fresh spinach leaves. Fruity onset but restrainedly so, hints of unripe peach, some raw pineapple, vague banana (but not descending into overt bubblegum effects at all) and pear, sweetish with mildly sourish surroundings, crisp carbonation but not exagerrated for this particular style and adding minerally effects, supple mouthfeel. Softly grainy middle, pale malt sweetishness Â’thickenedÂ’ by a dimly sourish and subduedly soapy wheatiness which takes over in the end but in all remains clean and slender as it should be in this specific wheat beer style, increasing amount of retronasal phenols towards the end but only adding mild spiciness; aromatic hoppiness dominates the finish, very APA-like, with a clear, pleasantly drying yet gentle bitterness, while at the same time releasing quite a lot of retronasal lime juice and Â’oldÂ’ grapefruit aromas. Ends notably yeasty - though not too Â’starchÂ’-like, but the wheat slickness gets the last word, adorned by an ethereal New World hop presence both in aroma and in bitterness; light but unmistakable minerals support this hop character even more (than necessary, IÂ’d almost add). I remember more classic examples of American wheat being more Â’wheatyÂ’ and less hoppy: this is more an APA with wheat than a Â’classicÂ’ American wheat ale to me, but since it does use wheat and this component is noticeable all the way through, I guess it qualifies and meets the requirements of the style. Hoppier than I expected, but in a good way; in all, a lovely beer for sure, I could drink this all day in summer, but beers like this are doubtlessly better fresh from tap so I hope to encounter it in that condition one day.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Opp fra 3.1. til 3.6. Fra fat pÃ¥ Mi2 feb-17: hveteÃ¸l?? Mer som en pale ale pÃ¥ belgisk gjÃ¦r. Men at den er frisk og god var vi alle enige om.","Stavanger, NORWAY","Holmen1"
