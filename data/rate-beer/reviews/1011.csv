1011,"2017-01-04",4.5,"On tap at Hunahpu Day. Originally reviewed 3/9/2014.Inky black. Stains the glass. Nice mocha head, but after a while its gone.
Incredible coffee aroma. No acidity. Earthy coffee. Rich chocolate. A hint of that Zhukov licorice in the back.
The coffee flavor is immense. Never domineering, but its the main attraction of this beer. Rich and blends perfectly with the chocolate. Molasses flavor in the back end.
Heavy and viscous. Low carbonation.

Ive missed this beer multiple times over the years. Im glad I finally got to try it. Worth all the elbow-throwing at Hunahpu Day.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

The beer is black with a thin beige collar that leaves some oily, filmy lacing on the snifter. The aroma offers a huge coffee presence. Extremely rich, dark, roasty.

1011,"2011-12-09",4.1,"In short: A big fat viscous chocolaty stout with an almost espresso-like coffee character.  Excellent (even if a bit overrated).
How: Fresh growler.  Sent to me by GodOfThunder, consumed within days of receiving it.  Thanks a lot Jay
The look: Pitch black body topped by a small brown head
In long: Nose is showing a roasted coffee beans over a chocolate cake.  Given the hype of the beer I expected a more explosive aroma. Body is thick and viscous as hell.  Somehow, the body felt more viscous than the base Marshall Zhukov, which is strange because usually I find that the coffee version of a big stout (example: Meph Addict vs Mephistopheles) makes for a dryer more roasted sensation.  Taste is pretty straightforward, a big fattening rich chocolate cake with fresh coffee beans.  Im sure not familiar with the flavor of the much talked about Kopi Lowak coffee variety but to me the Final Push coffee character was a bit more espresso than with other well known high-quality coffee stouts (Speedway, Peche Mortel, etc.).  Of all the quality coffee stouts Ive had Id say that Final Push was the most chocolaty Ive had.  Actually I dont think the coffee outshines the chocolate or vice-versa.  Alcohol is a bit apparent but it is fitting for this dessert beer.  Also some green herbal notes.  Carbonation was relatively smooth, I would have preferred a more active carbonation to increase drinkability but maybe it is because it was a growler consumed a week after it was filled.  So despite my long rambling, all I can really say about this beer is that it is a rich chocolate cake and coffee with some alcohol warmth and light green herbal notes.  Even after drinking a full growler I really cannot add anything.  It is   a straightforward but highly enjoyable sipper.  In a blind tasting I dont think it would score higher than the less hyped widely available quality coffee stouts out there (Speedway, Peche Mortel, etc.) but it remains an excellent example of the style.  And in case you drank the beer but dont know why the beer is named Final Push well, you dont want to know, just like you dont want to know if your mother ever kissed your goodnight after giving your father a blowjob.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

1011,"2011-09-26",3.9,"Tap at the BA Hunahpu release 9/24/11. Thanks to drowland for saving me a pour of this rarity. You are the man!Pour is typical Zhukov, an ink black SRM that produces a Martian red head looking extremely similar to used motor oil. Bubbles and all. Lots of glass staining but not a lot of head retention and lacing. Nose is quite nice. Im not the biggest coffee fan, but can appreciate having hazelnut, vanilla, cinnamon apples, and cocoa powder in the nose in lieu of near DMS like qualities and sharp, gritty roast. Rich and soft in the nose thankfully. For taste, I still think the palate is what shines above taste. Palate is rich and oily. Extremely thick but no cloying sugars like you would expect given the staining. Instead, the coffee does pack decent bitterness (no astringency) but there is still such a hefty dose of coffee acidity creating a tart lemon profile in the back end. Certainly yummy, but someone may see this as simply extremely thick coffee rather than imperial stout. Could use more bitterness and could work on the appearance department. If you are going for this whale, I hope you enjoy coffee explosion.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

The mouth feel was incredible, creamy and a little bubbly - reminded me of coffee ice cream. Finished smooth and mellow, leaving you with a mouthful of roasted malts and dry hops.

1011,"2011-09-04",1.9,"Thanks to ______, I had an opportunity to try this at the 2nd Pgh Tasting on the 2nd. Im not telling you who gave me a glass from the screw top bottle because I dont want him to get hatemail because of me!  Either way, I was really glad to have the chance to rate a beer that floridians consider one of the best, heheh. First off, my immature palate is not refined enough to be allowed to rate such a refined(?) big beer, so sue me. If you are a lover of CC then take my number and subtract it from 5 and get your real rating. From the beginning I knew this was going to be something else; weird looking screw top squatty bottle with a lable that had hand written FINAL PUSH on it. Pouring into the glass it looks like used 50W shovelhead motor oil. Coating the glass it seems to be staining it dark brown. Smell? Atttack of coffee on the olfactory. Did I say it smells like big coffee espresso? Sorry, I just recovered after hitting my head on the wall behind me. No head. Initially, all I tste in this stuff is big black triple espresso cold. Perhaps there is some alky in there but the flavor is so overwhelming coffee I cant stand it; over the top and way too much personality for this mockery of a beer. I dont know how stuff like this can be considered beer. OK, after my taste buds recover I do taste come tobacco and pepper in there, perhaps. From beginning to end this is nothing new in the coffee stout scene. Yes, special, perhaps but there are so many other beers out there with these characteristics; over the top roto-tilling burnt coffee and a little alky. Finish reminds me of grampas cold espresso with whiskey in it. Big thanks to the guy, you know who you are, that gave this too me to rate. I am very fortunate to have had the chance to taste this.  However, it reminds me of the big let down I experienced when tasting all those top 50 impy stouts when I first started rating beers here.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

aroma is unlike any beer ive ever experienced. absolutely stunning with the most intense, rich, world class espresso, charred french roast, fruity, freshly harvested coffee beans, and a touch of spiced, mexican blend and backed by elegant, pure dark chocolate, toasted hazelnuts, and hints of vanilla with subtle notes of cinnamon and topsoil as it warms in my CCB snifter. i literally spent 10 minutes savoring the aroma before taking a sip! so long, in fact, LJ started laughing at me and shes seen me rate hundreds of beers before this one. flavor is almost indescribable. just on a completely different level than mere mortal imperial coffee stouts with a massive onslaught of rich espresso, freshly roasted $100/lb coffee, and bitter, slightly fruity, spent grinds with a sublime balance offerred by rich, semi-sweet fudge, vanilla, and subtle molasses with hints of fresh cinnamon, dark fruits, and cigar ash on the back end. palate is nothing short of perfect. i mean, this ""shit"" drinks like a damn frappacino with a silky, slick texture, perfect carbonation, and the most intense, chocolate, roasted coffee finish ive ever experienced. overall, truly a sublime beer. no way i can rate this any less that a perfect 5 as its definitely one of the absolute best beers ive ever tasted.","Norfolk, Virginia, USA","ksurkin"

The aroma picked up a whole bunch of delicious coffee and roasty black malts, with touches of vanilla, nutty, and earthy notes.. excellent nose!  The flavor was somehow a notch better, and consistent with the hype machine.. delicious coffee throughout, accented by burnt chocolate and molasses.. heavy roast, but the balance held perfectly.. more coffee and warm boozy undertones on the finish.. absolutely no complaints.  Heavy-bodied with moderate carbonation on the palate.. a lot of coffee, and even more deliciousness!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

It pours very similar to the Hunahpus with a dark thick black oil-like appearance and the perfect caramel and dark cinnamon color super-lacey head. The aroma has huge delicious smooth coffee notes and light chocolate notes. The flavors of that coffee come through amazingly - as another review stated - better than the best coffee beer AND best coffee Ive ever tasted! There are some chocolate and roasty notes too, but nothing tastes as good and shines through on this impy stout like the coffee. Then the body, like Hunah, is creamy, thick but smooth, and perfectly carbonated. That creaminess with the coffee notes are soooo good.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"

Zhukov est déjà en elle même une imp stout complexe. On retrouve dans cette version, toute la bonté du malt, note de chocolat et vanille, parfois allant aussi sur un aspect de feuille de tabac qui met en avant une forte note de torréfaction et de malt grillé. Ce qui fait de Final Push au delà du jeu de mot du nom de la bière cest le caractère unique que donne ce café. Ce dernier propulse Final Push vers des sphères qui font que lon ne veut pas voir la fin du verre.

Lots of cacao, wooten notes, a little fart somewhere. The taste is so smooth with a nice sweet and very balanced taste that fades out in a somehow raw bitterness with the sweet notes as backing group with edgy salty notes, that traditionally goes along with an russian imperial stout. Reminds me a little of a cake dough. Its roasted to the max, but never gets over the top. The palate is creamy and very dilicious. Not to thick, but spot on. The finish is dominated of the coffee.

robust, strong amazingly fresh coffee nose, roasty with some subtle

bittersweet chocolate. Very light carbonation which def doesnt

T - Coffee beans, expresso, chocolate. Not quite as good as the nose, but hey, its still pretty fn excellent. Its like drinking a snifter-sized expresso with alcohol notes. Very, very good. A nice coffee bean-esk bitter finish. 

M - Full, rich, smooth, and creamy on the finish that also dries out after a bit.

Perhaps a reddish edge. Aromas are big sweetness of cocoa, roasty coffee, big bitter roast with sweet caramel, maple syrup, chocolate syrup, roasty barley and coffee, quite potent roasty poo coffee, which strikes a note as BGB Weasel similar. A lot going on, rich and ridiculous. Initial is thick and full bodied, lays strong on the palate, roasty coffee and creamy vanilla, big roasty coffee and dark chocolate, a bit tamer than the nose would have suggested. Covers the palate with sweet maple syrup, vanilla, caramel, roasted malts and big coffee roast and bitterness. The roasty coffee is rich and bitter, pretty big, the sweetness aids it along, preventing it from becoming acrid. Sweet and roasty, the sweetness lingers thickly on the palate at the back, roasty coffee comes through in powerful jabs, light piney hops. Quite rich and bitter. Thick and palate sticking, lingering roast and bitterness, sticky sweet syrupy caramel, cocoa, syrup.. Really, the aroma hits a home run, the taste is great, but the aroma is the far away strength. Best version Ive had of Zhukov yet. Roasty and rich, big bitterness with good dark chocolate influence. The flavors are deep, the complexity is there, and the strengths of base Zhukov (My favorite stout by CCB to date) are all present. The Kopi Luwak adds a deep roasty and bitter coffee feel, rich and strong and earthy. An honor to try. Aroma wins it, but the beer itself is no slouch. Cheers!","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

1011,"2010-09-21",4.3,"Rating #2200!  Ticked this beer on draft.  Pours black in color, and thick, with a well-formed tan head that is typical of Cigar City beers.  They really do tend to nail the appearance.  The aroma has big notes of delicious weasel crap coffee.  Yes I can tell the difference.  Besides that, a big base stout with dark chocolate and coffee shines through.  The flavor is not quite as amazing as the aroma, but is still excellent.  Just a little heavy on the char, but the coffee flavor is great and well-integrated.  Big, rich, dark malts form the base, lending roasty and toasty and chocolatey notes.  Some anise in there as well.  Very full and thick on the mouthfeel.  Carbonation is rather low, as it should be, but not nonexistent.  Awesome beer overall, and if there was a score for the name of the beer, this would get perfect marks considering I laughed out loud when I got the double entendre.

The nose has the most intense coffee aroma Ive ever encountered,  Heavy fresh brewed espresso, hearty roasted malt, and somehow no alcohol fumes at all.  Thick and intense roast flavor with loads of dark chocolate and the best coffee flavor Ive had in a beer.  It finishes with a touch of alcohol, but its amazingly well hidden.  Mouthfeel is full, thick, and oily with a velvety smoothness.  Perfect stuff.  This blows away any other Imperial Stouts Ive had.   This beer made me want to drop the crazy money it costs to get some of this coffee.  Is it the greatest beer in the world?  Probably not.  Is it kind of a one trick pony?  Maybe.

High grade coffee, bittersweet Belgian chocolate, dark fudge, a hint of smoke and ash initially on the nose. Molasses, maybe a touch of soy. The 11% is hardly noticeable at all. The coffee doesnt overpower the base beer at all... which is nice. Flavor is fairly coffee-dominant, but you can tell this is high grade shit (pun intended). Slightly ashy. Bitter chocolate. The roast level of the malt and the coffee are damn near perfect... almost to the point of being astringent, but never crossing that line. As on the nose, the alcohol is hidden expertly. Leaning toward full bodied. Slick, rich texture with a bitter, roasty, coffee laden finish. Im not a fan of coffee beers, but this one is really well done. Thanks","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"

Tons of sweet creamy coffee and sugar with nicely mellow roasted malts and chocolate. Like cake. Flavor is sweet, creamy, tons of rich coffee brownie like essence. Smooth rich but oh so drinkable. Just amazing.","Kingston, New York, USA","yobdoog"

1011,"2010-06-02",4.2,"Nitro at RBWG. One hell of a beer. More coffee than your morning espresso. Aroma is a bit lacking from the nitro treatment, and though this is full bodied, rich and delicious, it is so, so coffee dominant than it becomes a bit one dimensional. Truly unique and a joy to drink, however.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
1011,"2010-05-29",4.5,"Another 32 oz growler for GoT. Pours black with a deep brown head that lingered the whole time. Big smooth coffee aroma, chocolate and a light roasted malt scent. Flavor is about as rich and smooth as any beer can get, the coffee is dominant but not acidic at all, so smooth and balanced without being overly sweet and not a sign of the alcohol. Full body with mild carbonation and a lush, thick mouth feel. This beer is so good and really lived up to the hype, so smooth and easy drinking for such a rich, strong beer. Damn Jay, I owe you big time for this one.","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","savnac"

Lingers for quite sometime. Hints of toffee and the caramel from the nose. Overall, this is an amazing stout.

Flavors of charcoal bitters, bold espresso, mocha, and alcohol, all complemented with soft bubbles of carbonation. Drinkability: Stunning quality, almost effortless.

Espresso, coffee roastiness, dark underlying fruits but subdued to rich dark chocolate tones, the ultimate dessert.

Aroma of leather, tar, tons of espresso, dark roast, chocolate and burnt malt. Flavor is very similar with lots and lots of espresso. Almost like drinking the best espresso possible, but its a beer. There is almost no residual sweetness but its extremely thick and dry as well. Huge mouthfeel. A privilege to try and now I need to seek out the regular Zhukovs.

1011,"2010-04-11",4.6,"Nitro tap at Redlight for the RBWG. This one pours absolutely pitch black with no light escaping through and topped by a thick and foamy tan colored head that shows great retention. The head slowly receds and leaves a solid sheet of lace around the glass. By far one of the best looking beers I have seen in awhile. The aroma is a chocolate and coffee delight with the darki, roasted coffee up front followed by rich and decadent milk and dark chocolate. There is also a touch of cream in there too. The flavors follow suit and are just as rich and decadent. The freshly roasted coffee comes through in the flavor first and perfectly balances the dark chocolate malt. Sweet milk chocolate and cream round out the flavor profile. The coffee is really well integrated without being overly roasted at all. The palate is full bodied, creamy, and extremely smooth with perfect carbonation and avoids any kind of stickiness. The smooth body helps it go down so easily and hides the 11% alcohol really well, which is a little scary. I could easily drink a lot of this beer. I think I can say this is the best coffee beer I have ever had. I hope they do this one again.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"

I just enjoyed a couple pints of Zhukovs Final  Push at the Order of the Red Banner dinner 2013. Better than I expected and I expected a lot. Just a deep, black, vanilla, charred, evil, espresso, acrid smoke, tobacco. So many great things about this beer... even better than the first time I tried this one, back in 2010. Greatest coffee beer ever!
Original Rating 
Nitro RBWG 10 This beer rocks! Tar black ale with a mid-sized, creamy, dark brown head. Fantastic retention. The pungent, acrid aroma must weigh in at about 800 lbs. Huge, acidic, earthy, espresso and dark chocolate aroma. Smells more like espresso than espresso. Lesser notes of maduro tobacco and blackstrap molasses. Almost fecal in a good way, much like a funky-as-hell, barnyard-ish, Belgian lambics bouquet can be very appealing.  Full-bodied and velvety with pillow-soft carbonation. Big, bold, acrid espresso and black malt flavor. Malt sweetness is countered by carbonous espresso and charcoal bitterness. Undertones of pouch tobacco, cocoa nibs and blackstrap molasses. Lingering mocha finish.   
Kudos to growler for saving me a generous pull of this world class coffee imperial stout as I was about two hours late for this event. Me? Late? Imagine that.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

Nose has huge notes of coffee and chocolate both very pronounced and balanced with the lighter notes of roasted malt and vanilla.  More of a breakfast than a beer.

1011,"2010-03-20",4.7,"Off the nitro tap @ Red Light Red light, during RBWG. BOOM! Is this a flavor bomb or an aroma bomb? Cant decide. This thing is, hands-down, one of the best stouts Ive ever had. When I poured it into my (large) snifter, the head came up thick, creamy and dense; very dark brown in color, too.  
I took a whiff and got some of the richest, most enticing coffee notes Ive ever smelled (on coffee or beer). The weasels did a bang-up job on this batch. The appearance was definitely trade-mark zhukov: viscous, heavy, dense and darker than a  black steers tuckus on a moonless prairie night. 
The taste is phenomenal: bitter chocolate, COFFEE, some very subtle licorice, light vanilla. You immediately notice the staple dark amber coating on your glass after you take the first sip. Amazing beer! The back palate lingers with some notes of coffee and dark fruit.

1011,"2010-03-14",4.6,"Nitro tap at Redlight Redlight for RBWG.  Perhaps the most menacing looking beer I have ever seen.  The pour yields an absolutely pitch black, impenetrable abyss of darkness.  A dark brown head is as thick and creamy as any Ive ever seen, appearing almost like a chocolate milkshake floater.  A dense, solid sheet of lace stains the glass to the point where it takes a second rinse to clear it all away.  The nose is a coffee and chocolate lovers dream.  Perfectly roasted, dark and decadent coffee simply explodes from the glass, followed by equally decadent layers of dark and milk chocolates, and a velvety splash of heavy cream.  Flavors follow right in line, as rich and luscious as the nose hints it might be.  The softly bitter coffee roast is less earthy than I expected, very clean actually, and it serves as the perfect counterpoint to the light sweetness of the dark chocolate malt base.  On the palate, the velvety body is mouth coating and creamy, without being sticky in the least.  Its almost sessionable, which is scary for an 11% brute.  This was significantly better than the bourbon and brandy barrel Zhukov treatments that I had the night before.  Best coffee beer Ive ever had, by a wide margin.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
