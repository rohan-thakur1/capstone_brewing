3637,"2012-12-17",3.0,"Cask (Pint in Cumberland, Edinburgh):
Fruity to start with, followed by some grassy hops and a touch of caramel. There is some orange in their and a basic cask fruity smell to the beer.

An orange amber colour with a thin, foamy white head taht stays throughout.

Fruity and orange like to begin along with some earthy malts and a light, sweet flavour following this. There is a again that standard cask fruity flavour to the taste.

Smooth with a medium, almost full body and a creamy feel to it. There is very little in the way of carbonation as expected and a definite fruity bitterness to the finish.

A good fruity smell to begin but one that fades faster than I would have liked before becoming pretty average. The taste was also pretty average throughout and standard fare for a cask ale from start to finish; Ill stick to Tempest beers on keg in future.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

Bitter at first on the palate, grapefruit citrus comes out first, then piney hops.
