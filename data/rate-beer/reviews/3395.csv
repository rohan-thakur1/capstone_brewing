3395,"2016-05-05",4.3,"For Cinco de Mayo! Batch No 2015, corked and caged, 12.7 fl oz, no idea about alcohol level. Unavoidably extreme and terrible gusher, probably lost about a quarter to the floor, resulting hazy chestnut beer in the glass incredibly carbonated, agitated like a shaken nest of hornets long after the brief tan head fizzed itself out. Nose potent Brett, grape with huge cherry and raisin, sharp acidity, very heavy wood, some mild lactone but more woodsy and decaying leaves overall. Bracing acidity puckers right off the bat and it has that element that amplifies the bitterness to medium-strong; its not an IPA-like bitterness, cleaner and closer to scratchy tannins than hop derivatives. Tremendous fruitiness married perfectly to the sourness, a really fresh, bright edge on top. Little bit of lemon/citrus along with the balanced but deep and complex brown malt. Nice mix of lactic and acetic, the latter reserved enough that I cant readily use my favorite balsamic deScriptor; medium body with a milky and lightly burning finish. Still no idea about alcohol. I really like the grape variety they used, neither jammy nor foxy, but elegant and warm; the tannins and wood lend tremendous structure to what would otherwise be an over-aggressive loudmouth (though Im sure someones calling this a ""wood bomb""). World class, right here. [2016.05.05: 4.3]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

Solid sour for sure, but for the price it is a step below cascade sours or bruery sours, and even a bit more expensive than those for similar volume.

Perfect malt balance, sourness was all malo-lactic with a good brett kick and very light on the grapes. Red wine barrel brightens things and add some complexity but leave the yeast and bacteria to do its thing.More than anything, I just want to highlight how ridiculous these fests can get. There was literally never a wait to get a beer from Captain Lawrence, at any point in the fest, whereas most of the ""Popular Brewers"" had 10-15 minute waits. Not trying to be Captain Cynical here, but for gods sake, make up your own mind on beers and try the ""little guys"". Strange, though, that Capt. Lawrence is just a little guy.

Aroma is a balanced blend of acidity and grapes. Slight acetic character. Moderate fruit notes from the grapes and some medium low oak notes. Medium light funk and moderate tart cherries also present. 
Pours an auburn brown with ruby highlights. Somewhat murky. Thin slightly off white head that disappears almost immediately. 
Flavor hits with a bit of sweetness but then a sharp acidity. Slightly sweet grape jam notes upfront, then the grape notes turn fairly tart. Some Brett funk but more on the fruity side than barnyard with some cherries. Light oak notes and tannins. Slight acetic character to the acid but mostly lactic. Some citrus fruit and grapefruit notes as the beer warms. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low acidic astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a fairly nice beer but quite the acid bomb. I would prefer a little less acid and tannins and a bit more barnyard funk. Nice balance of grapes and cherry notes from the Brett.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

The overall on this one is 19/20, I find that after 4 years of cellering that this is as good as it will get, very balanced, the abv is well hidden, the acidity levels have decreased dramatically from that of the batch 3 fresh.

Batch 3:  Same pour as batch two with a slightly longer lasting head, yet it disappears within a minute as well. The aroma is also the same with surprisingly more depth to the toasty leathery funk.

Batch 1 & 2 tasted one after the other, starting with batch one. *My numerical ratings are for the batch one*

A - Both pour hazy amber, bordering on light red, with a small one finger tall head leaving light webs of lacing down the glass.

S - The batch one definitely has more sourness than the batch two. Both have hints of tart cherries, oak, dry brett yeast, and dulled red wine. I would say batch one was the clear winner in this category.

T - Batch one has way more sourness to it, while batch two has more brett and horse blanket dryness. Both have some underlining sweetness to go along with plenty of sour grapes, tart cherries, oak, and dry yeast. Finish on both is bone but it doesnt linger for very long. I greatly preferred the batch one but I still enjoyed the batch two. Very good stuff.

M - Both have a medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Batch one has quite a bit of pucker in the feel, while batch two has more of a bretty yeast feel to it. I prefer batch one here as well.

D - Very nice stuff. I would say batch one was the clear winner. The batch two seemed to be still developing a bit but I am not sure if it will ever get to batch ones level. Thanks again Dan for the chance to try these side by side.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

3395,"2011-07-26",4.7,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2011 Batch 3. Beautiful hazy rosy coppery-gold with pale red highlights and a quickly-dissipating very fine off-white head. Fine strands of tiny bubbles gracefully stream up from the bottom of the glass. A deep, piercingly sour aroma tickles the nose at first and leads into a background of soft spice while expressing a hair-raising lactic sour verve. Vibrant vinous fruitiness is intermingled with soft oak and barrel oxidation and a pleasant solvency only deepens the complexity. Taste bud-cramping sourness on the attack clears to reveal a multi-layered dark grapey fruitiness and an uncanny wine-like complexity. Alcohol rises in the back-end with deeply complex fermentation notes and a very slight spicy bitterness with a hint of light, nutty malt. The body is light but its nimble presence in the mouth conveys significant strength. The finish goes on and on as it slowly unfolds a profound complexity across the palate. This is truly a perfect hybrid drinking experience between beer and wine. Quite amazing.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

3395,"2011-07-04",4.4,"Batch 2. The cap was beginning to show signs of rust. Removal produces a nice pop and then....gusher. It was a slow gush, but it still stirred up the beer enough to allow all the bottom sediment to circulate around. As the foam was coming up and over I poured an inch or so into the glass. I noticed some nice red phloem chunks floating around, so the rest of the beer was poured through a strainer. Using a palm tulip for this.  A - Deep brownish red. Quite cloudy due to the circulation. There was obviously a ton of foam, but it all died down nicely to a one finger spotty off-white head which eventually turned into some nice lacing around the edges. S - Oak, vanilla, grapes, and vinegar. This smell is great, but not as complex as the flavor profile. T - Tart grape juice. Lots of oak which provides a ton of dry wood and vanilla flavors. Vinegar and some light brett funk, finished up with just a hint of booze. Rather complex and very delicious. O - Wow! I love this beer. Im a big fan of flanders and oud bruins. This is just amazing.

3395,"2011-06-01",4.0,"Batch #3. Poured into a tulip.

3.5 A: Opaque amber grape color. Between two and three fingers of beige fizzy soda pop head falls almost as quickly as it was formed despite a steady stream of bubbles and leaves no lacing.

4.0 S: Big time grape/vinous character. Super tart with lactic sourness as well. Also a lot of musty, musky funk. Supple tannins give a light astringent. Cherry is second to grape and is accompanied by oak and a light vanilla. Complex and pleasant.

4.5 T: Taste is much like the nose, but for whatever reason, it is more impressive. Anyway, tart grape and cherry with some lactic sourness, but not quite mouth puckering. Instead, the sourness level allows for this beer to be wonderfully well balanced. Quite fruity overall with some plum underneath the cherry and grape. Surprisingly, the cherry is stronger than the grape. Toasty malts in the middle with light caramel notes. The finish is woody and astringent with a lot of the brett funkiness coming into play.

4.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Incredibly creamy, like the head on a cappucino.

4.5 D: This is a very good beer. Until now, Ive never really been impressed by CL. Complex throughout with great flavors and a killer mouthfeel.

Muddy brown pour that nearly fizzed out of the bottle. The head dies quickly, but livens up with a swirl beautifully. First whiff of the aroma gave of huge red wine and barrel tones, and that was just while pouring. Once I really got my nose in there the nose progresses to monstrous oak, lemon, Bretty funk, barnyard, and some nice vinous sour grape, cherry and bubblegum undertones. Flavor brings tons more barrel, with big woody oak and vanilla tannin presence. Bretty funk takes a back seat, but is still present at just the right level. More vinous booze, almost at the sherry or port level. Mouthfeel is much less acidic than I expected, but its really beautiful, with the barrel and sweet wine presence really toning things down exceptionally well; a wondrously drinkable sour.

Oak is the backbone, balanced and complex, could be a tad more tart. Smells is a little like consecreation mainly because of the oak...The taste is is very oaky, like the aroma is the backbone of the beer peaking out at all corners.

3395,"2011-03-28",4.0,"Batch 1. Big thanks to Brad for the bottle - this one was a treat to try. Apparently Captain Lawrence really, really didnt want the bottle opened too soon - trying to force the wax off the top actually broke my bottle opener in half. After winning the battle (I pulled out a ViseGrip), this brew poured a murky brownish amber, with only a tiny bit of carbonation left. Nose is cherries, oak, dry merlot, tons of funk, some raspberry, and some underlying vanilla. Flavor starts out sweet and fruity, almost immediately building a sour zing, Both sides of the flavor attack your palate with reckless abandon, building to a crescendo and then leaving your mouth whimpering in the aftermath. Super complex - theyre right about that - and interesting in that despite the lack of carbonation, it still feels tingly/prickly. The sour quality in here actually takes the place of the carbonation, a la Cantillon. I thought it was a bit too oaky/funky at first, but its really grown on me throughout the glass. Im a fan.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

A-pours a brownish copper color with notes of orange edges. The head is off white and creamy looking. Bubbles reside on top

S-the nose is quite nice with white grapes and a nice tartness touching the nose first. A nice oaky wood aroma and a touch of vanilla come in next, hints of sawdust underneath with a light sweetness and a touch of funk in the back

T-A tart but sweet note of grape comes in first. Earthy malts and the taste of musk fades in after the initial sweetness. The finish adds some cherries with some light vinigar acidity

M-the feel is great, full bodied, soft and creamy on the palate. The body holds through the entire drink coating the mouth. The finish is slightly prickly on the back of the throat.

3395,"2011-02-21",4.4,"375ml Bottle.  Batch 2.  A big thanks to peteinSD for sharing this one!  Should start by saying that this is one of the best sours anywhere and totally blew me away.  Had a deep murky brick color in the glass with a tiny layer of white bubbles.  Nose was powerful with some potent funk and a nice layer of sweet red wine grapes.  Exceedingly intricate flavor profile with strong tart notes, dry red wine barrel character and a bit of detectable sweetness that reminds me of brown ale which I think is the base for this one.  The tartness is bright and has a bit of grape and green apple character.  Brett is noticeable in the aroma, but also seems to take the edge off the strong lacto presence by contributing that odd barnyard and stale cheese note.  The palate is medium light with a soft carbonation and the balance of the sour character is outstanding.  I could seriously drink this beer all day with no drop off in enjoyment.  This one was good enough that it is painful to think about the fact that I may never get my hands on it again.  A definite winner.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"

Pours a very dark ruby red color with dark mahogany edges when held to a light source and a one finger off white head that quickly settles into a lasting ring.

Funky, musty aroma with prominent earthy oak along with some vanilla, brett effervescence and vinous dark fruit. Captain Lawrence does a good job of replicating the funk from Belgian lambics really well in their sours and this one is no exception. A lot of the American Wild Ales Ive encountered recently are overpowered by a dry brett character but this one has a musty, earthy, barnyard/horsey presence to it. Thats not to say that its as intense as a Belgian sour but its there. Theres also a subtle vinegar presence and a very strong vinous dark fruit/red wine character. Lots of grape, tart dark cherry, currant and other berries.

Tart, puckering medium body that is pretty sour and slightly acidic but this is countered by the sweet vinous dark fruit notes, earthy oak, lacto, dry brett and subtle vanilla. This beer starts off pretty tart with a puckering sourness that lingers throughout. Again, there is some nice earthy/musty barnyard funk going on in addition to the dry brett presence. The funk is complimented by the dry brett and earthy oak. Theres a very prominent sweet, vinous dark fruit presence mid-palate that balances things out. Hints of grape, tart dark cherries, currant, plum and other dark berries. The label says that fresh red grapes are added but I wouldnt be surprised if this was aged in a red wine barrel. The sweetness from the grapes is excellently compliment by the lingering vinegary puckering character in the dry finish. As soon as I put the glass down Im salivating for more. There is some slight acidity but this beer is incredibly quaffable.

This is the best sour Ive had from Captain Lawrence so far and one of the better American Wild Ales Ive had in a while.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Smells of musk, Brett, tart red grapes, and fresh, dry oak. A small amount of earthiness (geosmin) comes through, as well. Quite tannic in the mouth, with, unsurprisingly, quite a lot of vinousness. Dry, with some pucker. The nose is juicier than the taste, but this is still a nice combination red grape, cranberry, oak, and earthy spiciness.

Just a touch of caramel malt peeks through, Im almost reminded of cinnamon glazed green apples with the balance of the sweet and intense sour.

But that being said, theres something missing that is making it a religious experience.

A - Pours a dark ruby red with a dark tannish colored head that quickly disipitates, leaving nothing more then the body of the beer. No bubbles, no lacing, nothing. Just a muddled ruby red colored body.

S - Some nice tart/sour notes, but not too funky. Grapes, apples, pears, lots of nice sweet fruit mixed into the sour notes of the brett. Theres a good amount of oak and red wine as well, as indicated that these were what the beer was stored in.

T - Tastes like grape juice with a kick of funk. The red wine, oak, and grapes are very present and right up front. The tart/sour quickly follows behind and finishes with a wine-ask tannic alcohol burn. A nice lip puckering sour finish.

M - Light to medium bodied. Has a feel similar to a red wine, perhaps a Pinot Noir but not as big as a Cabernet or Syrah. No real carbonation, which is a bit disappointing.

3395,"2010-07-10",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2012 Side by side tasting of Batch 1 and Batch 2. Score is for Batch 1.

A: Both had a reddish-brown body with no difference between the two. A short lived off-white head that was relatively small. The batch 2 had significantly more carbonation and it kept the skim a bit thicker once the head settled down. Spotty lacing on both.

S: 
Batch 1: Oaky and woody. A decidedly earthy bitterness. Red wine grapes are present. (8)
Batch 2: Less oak. More fruity without the earthy bitterness. Here the grapes were the most prevalent aroma. A zesty orange bitterness is here in the background too. (7)

T:
Batch 1: Complex earthy funk. Oak with a slight floral twinge. Red wine skins, and dark fruits. Leather and vinegar notes are also here. The flavors are intricately woven together. (8)
Batch 2: Lessy funky and oaky. The red wine skins are a bit ""fresher."" More fruit like and a little more sour. The orange notes from the nose are here too. The best way I can describe it is the flavor from orange sunkist soda. The higher levels of carbonation in batch 2 definitely played a part in this. (7)

M:
Batch 1: Medium bodied with light, even carbonation. Nice bitterness in the back end. Good acidity and pleasantly tart. (4.5)
Batch 2: Medium bodied and a bit over carbonated. More sour and not as acidic. (3.5)

O:
Batch 1: Delicious. Enjoyable to drink and pleasantly complex. (17)
Batch 2: Nice, but when put side by side with batch 2, it just isnt there yet. (15)

Grape vinegar, cherries and plenty of wooden tannins conjure up clean sourness in this gum-drying Barrel-Aged Sour Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A thin ring of foam surrounds the cloudy brownish red.
-The sour lengths were quite pleasant (tickling the lower ear, even), but might appear harsh to those who arent huge fans of the style.
-Carbonation was very low, increasing the impression of sourness. A little more effervescence would have helped me enjoy this in bigger gulps.
-The mouthfeel is lean and classy.
-Buttery edges are found here and there.

Batch 2: Pours hazy redish brown with decent off white head.  Super tart raisin and sour grape aroma, along with oak and vanilla.  Taste was super tart with a very dry muted finish.  Over-carbonated and by itself an incredible beer. 8/4/7/3/17 - 3.9


Batch 1: Pours hazy muted brown with very little tan head.  Aroma was very well blended with mild grape, a little apple and raisin.  Flavor was incredibly complex and melded together.  Great grape and vanilla flavor with great tartness.  Medium body, and light carbonation and increidbly smooth finish.

Grapes stood out towards the finish after lots of bretty-funk, hay, earthy tones.  Candied sugars with some grape fruit tones that were very defined in the taste.   A great drinking beer!","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
3395,"2010-04-27",5.0,"Batch 2.  Bottle from a PUBN sergeant-at-arms.  Pours turbid dark apple cidery color, toward mahogany brown with 1-finger off-white head.  Nose is very complex and wonderful; a medley of oaky spirits, red wine grapes, funky yeast, earthy raisins, and apple.  Tastes oaky, with sweet malt up front, some tart cherry, red winey grape, mid-palate cinnamon apple flavor, and earthy tartness as it warmed.  Very complex, very delicious, and just incredible.  This is one of the absolute best sour ales I have ever quaffed, and you owe it to yourself to find a Craigs list crack whore to stand in line the next time they release this stuff!","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
3395,"2010-04-26",4.3,"Thanks Kevin for sharing this! Batch #2 from the recent release.

A- Body is a very foggy, nearly opaque, medium brown with a very slight red tint. Pours with a 1 finger head that slowly fades to a thick collar. Traces of lacing left behind in the glass. Fogginess is dynamic.

S- Yes. This nose screams ""Flanders Oud Bruin"" Nose consists of a balance of oak, wood, vanilla, as well as a hint of vinegar and a hint of funk.

T- An acidic tartness not detectable in the nose is the first flavor to come through (which is a nice surprise), a touch of vinegar also comes through initially. Behind this is a touch of grape as well as a good dose of oak. The finish is dry and almost hot as a slightly metallic component comes through. Well put together and very complex.

P-Carbonation is low and body is medium weight with a feel that is smooth, creamy, and yeasty. Very well done.

O- This is a high quality sour brown that CL has put together. Its soft and very complex. Wonderful example of the style. Glad to have been able to try this gem!

Taste delivers everything the nose promises and serves it on a platter of rich, batter-like malts.  Mouthfeel is sublime; with just enough heft and soft carbonation for a lingering and flavor accentuating finish.  I have seen mixed reviews on this one, so I was not sure what to expect.  I must say that this is not your typical sour.  There is a wonderfully complex interplay going on here.  I have never had a sour be so tart, funky, and RICH before.

3395,"2010-01-13",4.2,"375 ml bottle likely from TheEpeeist. Thanks, Chris! The final of my 4 CL Sour ratings. Pours a murky rusty red, well carbonated with a beige head with brown flecks, moderate dies to small film that laces pretty well. Aromas are big, big blasts of sour cherries, grapes, vinegar, decent funkiness, the sourness is quite dominant, some sweet malts beneath of caramel, vanilla and wet oak, sour fruits become the strongest with a touch of vinegar and funk. Initial is  a nice burst of sour fruits, vinegar, and barnyard funk, with wet oak and vanilla, caramel sweetness sticking into the backend. Acidity is moderate, flows down the back of the palate, alcohol isnt really noticeable, cereal and caramel malts, vanilla and oak, good sourness and vinegar, this beer is exceptionally well balanced, with sweetness and sourness sticking well on the backend and finish, and the sourness and funk taking the front end by storm. A touch of chalkiness in the sour finish, as it grows into a palate pleasing elixir, red wine bitterness/tannins stick to the palate. This is a great beer, probably the best overall/balanced sour put out by CL, differing from the delicate and complex CdC or the face puckering intensity of Flaming Fury (My personal favorite).

3395,"2009-10-30",4.0,"375mL bottle, batch 1, courtesy of an extremely generous BA, poured into a tulip.

Pours a very murky reddish brown with a smattering of fizzy off-white bubbles that recedes immediately leaving nothing at all on top.  Needless to say, no lacing on this one.

The aroma is massive with tons of tart cherries, red grapes and plenty of brown sugar sweetness.  There is also hints of vanilla and maybe even some chocolate.  The brett is present but not a dominant aroma.

The taste is a bit more tart and funky that the aroma and the sweetness of the sugar and vanilla is less prevalent.  The brett starts to come out much more in the finish and it definitely has a dry, earthy funk in the aftertaste with some dry wine-like character as well.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and dry on the palate with very little carbonation.

3395,"2009-10-25",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 23, 2010 Bottle thanks to Mudpuppet (BA)!Ive been chasing this one since NYBeer joked about the unwashed beer nerds, piled up high in the back seats of each others cars, rubbing their hands greedily and, with an evil grin, successfully growling ""Rosso!"" to themselves as they sped off together from the release with their allotments. This was of course mentioned while we drank and hoarded all the rarities we could muster at the Southampton release on the very same day.
Slightly opaque mahogany, tan bubbles become a thin white film. The nose has supreme balance and reminds of a tart Sinners 08: strong citrus, grape, cherry and wood, light vanilla and brown sugar. Flavor begins slightly astringent with the heavy sour cherry notes (this doesnt bring in the fresh grape and lemon or faint malt as well as Castleton), more wood than the flavor, light balsamic and citrus. Then comes the awe inspiring fresh grape and more red wine, strong towards the finish and the two combining to impart a juicy note that blasts the mouth right before it goes all dry and puckering. Long-lasting grape notes that dance on the wine barrel. I tried to be objective here, even said Id keep it low just because it was rare and a sour, but in the end Im just another nerd that loves rare beer and gets nerdy in its presence. Rosso! 94105194/2010, 10/2010 - Ive had two bottles of b2. The first was 2-3 months old, still showing a lot of softness like b1, some grape though not as sweet as b1. At 8-9 months, carbonation gone, very thin and vinous, lots of grape sweetness (not sugars) but almost nothing else. Floating white flecks on top (ryan explained it, cant remember). Stunned by how bad this was. Hopefully b3 returns to b1 or early b2 goodness.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

Fairly flat medium body, very watery composition to it. Wood makes itself evident right from the drop. Dark, biting, bitter oak. The wine grapes are knocking around here, there, and everywhere, giving it depth and breadth but not really announcing themselves with any clarity--there might be a little bit of leatheriness, or some currants, maybe some black pepper. But you cant really get a hold of any one note for any length of time. The bretts working overtime, theres tartness, balsamic, lemon, lots of goodness. All on the acidic and sharp side.

3395,"2009-08-01",4.1,"Batch 1.  375ml red wax capped bottle.  Aged about 5 or 6 months Id guess.  Pours nearly flat, hazy red-amber in hue.  A pencil-lead thin ring of fizz is all that marks the surface, and not a dot of lacing marks the glass, though some thin sheeting does show.  The aroma is quite acetic, sour cherry and juicy, peppery Zinfandel grapes showing quite tart and tannic.  Theres loads of oaky barrel influence, lending a woody, vanilla overtone.  The brett funk is there, but its mild, less barnyard-like than expected.  Flavors are very much the same, puckering cherry, apple, and red grape notes all drawn together nicely by the old, woody oak, with a nice, peppery finish that rivals that of some big red wines.  Its about as vinous as any beer I can recall, similar in profile to a lower gravity Bon Chien.  The palate is surprisingly hefty, certainly more so than expected, with a light, tingly carbonation and a dry, puckering finish.  Excellent brew.

375ml red waxed dark green bottle poured into a tulip.

A: Pours an opaque dark plum flesh, nearly as deep a the red grapes that were used in the barrels. Small, somewhat fizzy head forms and dies immediately. No lacing.

S: Soft fruity and tannin notes with a healthy waft of the red grapes. Some vinous wine notes. Maybe some tart wheaty notes? Some hidden sweetness in the back, maybe light caramel.

T/M: Good sour and tartness level, right on the edge of puckering. The red grapes come out very nicely along with some cherry, red apple, and pear notes. Not overly funky with some wisps of barn and hay... I think Id like to see a little bit more. More of the light caramel in the very back mixing well with the oak and vinous wine barrel. Body is medium light with decent carbonation. A bit dry on the tongue but not overly so.

D: Very solid brew and definitely my favorite Oud Bruin by far. Easily drinkable and refreshing, hard to sip and savor. I do think a touch more funk with a drier feel and finish would benefit this brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","pimpp"

3395,"2009-05-16",3.9,"Batch 1; Sampled April 2009
A solid pour into my Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a one-finger thick, fizzy, tan colored head that dissipates fairly quickly.  The beer is a dark, murky, plum color that shows a somewhat hazed, dark cherry red color when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of sour cherries up front (though not as vibrant as sour pie cherries would be), tart lactic notes, tannic wood aromas, spicy oak and lots of woody plank like character.  This is quite fruity smelling, but it is hard to break out the exact fruits that the nose evokes; it seems comprised of aromas like cherry, cranberries, a touch of concord grape character, some currant notes as well as something that is distinctly fruity, but that I cant quite describe.  Towards the end of my glass (once the beer has warmed up quite a bit), musty Brettanomyces notes are noticeable with a touch of urea and some sweaty leather notes.  The nose has a nice mix of wood and fruit, with a interesting backdrop of funkiness that boosts the complexity quite a bit.

The beer tastes tart as it first hits my tongue and the sourness becomes more gripping as it moves across my palate.  The finish is a complex mix of tart, tannic fruit, wood, and berry-like notes.  The carbonation adds a fizzy texture and there is also a tannic heft to the body of this beer that adds weight to what would otherwise be a light beer.  This beer has an exquisite texture to it because of the oak and fruit; it really clings to the palate, with a texture that is beyond the finishing gravity.  The oak adds some nice spiciness as well as an earthiness that is at least somewhat barrel influenced.  As the beer warms up a light mustiness becomes noticeable, a touch of barnyard character also becomes noticeable though both are not much beyond a subtle touch.

This is a very nice beer; the grapes add a nice complexity that is boosted by the oak character and the ample, but not quite overwhelming, sourness.  This is a nicely balanced beer, though the aroma really needs to warm up quite a bit before it becomes nicely complex from the underlying Brettanomyces influence.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The flavor follows suit with tart cherry and grapes blended with the wine flavors and oaky aceticness. There is a lactic creaminess that comes through and smooths things out from getting overly sour.

Aroma is super thick with wine barrel, lactic and acetic tartness, sour cherries, some horsey brett notes, and other funky and sharp notes.

3395,"2009-03-01",4.7,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2012 This review is for batch 1, no other batch was able to match the original imho
In short:  Sourness, oak, cherries, funkiness and red wine dominate in this ultra-intense Flemish-Sour interpretation.  Fantastic.
How: Many times, first at Boston Extreme Beer Fest 2009, then bottles home.  Also a bottle at Brooklyns Beer Table beer bar.
The look: Slightly cloudy (if first serving of a bottle) to totally opaque (if last serving of a bottle) redish-amber body topped by a small beige head.
In long: I could smell this beer from 10 feet away.  Intensely funky, oaky and cherry nose.  Taste is intense.  First, compared to most intensely sour/acidic beer this one has a well malted body.  A whole lot of cake-like malts are the foundation an array of flavours including caramelized sour cherries, sour oak socked in red wine, earth, more wood, barnyard funk, vinegar acidity, more.  Similarity could be drawn to a less complex but sharper and more intense La Folie.  This is not a session beer, this is the most intense and one of the most complex Captain Lawrence creation so far.  This beer may not be better than sex but sliced bread is in serious trouble.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Cant remember anything Ive had where the finish was this long lasting.

3395,"2009-02-24",4.2,"375mL bottle, batch 1 from LilBeerDoctor, thanks Margaret!  Hazy orange brown with a ring of big beige bubbles for a head.  Acidic lacto and leathery brett up front, with definite red grape skins and wine characteristics and oak to back it up.  The only sweetness comes from some earthy caramel.  The flavor is crazy good and complex.  Moderately sour and acidic (4-5 on the sour-o-meter), full of grape skins and tart plums as well as the wine and oak barrel complementing everything.  Ah, and the light brown sugar is present to keep this from being a complete sour beast.  Bone dry finish, bitterness peaking around a 2 and a slight alcohol burn noted.  Light carbonation with a medium body.  Very, very good--I definitely prefer this to Castleton batch 2 (mainly because 2 was a brett bomb, still good though)--dunno about 1, though, as its been a while since I had that.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
3395,"2009-02-20",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2013 Should add a re rate note on this one. have tried all three batches and have found my preference to be around a year out. Interesting for me I like to kick up the sediment in this beer and it seems to give it a fuller mouth feel and add a depth to the grape flavors. perhaps the sediment is heavy on the grape particles. anyway, carbonation is always nice and it holds a fairly high level longer than most sours seem to do. have tried a batch two and a batch three in the last month and my high rating score holds on this beer.


bottle poured an unfiltered orange brown color with a still look in the glass and no visible carbonation. aroma has wild yeast, oak, dark grapes, ripe cherry, funky sour, Beaujolais, and light acid. medium mouth feel but it coats incredibly well and there is a touch of carbonation. flavor starts of with a nice acidic sour, wine barrel, dark fruit, plenty of oak, and waters up the tongue. this really hits the wine barrel flavors just right and there is sweetness underlying that contains the acidity to the right level. flavors continue to develop through the glass bringing subtle brown sugar, chestnut, and grape skins. this has benefited from the amount of time it spent in the barrel, another home run from scott.","Connecticut, USA","blklab2007"
3395,"2009-02-19",4.1,"Got one of the last 16 bottles at the brewery when they were released. The pour is a cloudy amber with a redish tint and there is no head at all. The nose is amazing with cherry and grape blended with toffee and hops and an oak finish. The initial flavor is nice and sour and you can really taste the dark fruits. It is a nicely carbonated brew and as you sip on it there is a pleasant after taste of butter and yeast. It is a funky beer with an interesting flavor and im glad i made the trip down to get my 4 bottles.","Bristol, Rhode Island, USA","emerica56"
3395,"2009-02-19",4.2,"Got this bad larry at the brewery. I was the last dude to get my 4 bottles! It pours a murky clay colour with no head, just some large soapy bubles. The nose eminates feet from the glass. The nose is acetic, vinous, oaky and is laced with nuances of cherry, merlot, and considerable barnyard funknasty. The flavour is extremely tart, with loads of Bretty yeast and robust oak. The wine-like character is authentic tasting...for obvious reasons. This is so tart and acetic that it takes on a vingar-like flavour. The aftertaste is oaky, tannic and buttery. On the palate, it is gently carbonated, gritty, full-bodied and very acetic.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Drink4Satan"
3395,"2009-02-19",4.1,"Pours cloudy redish brown. Aroma is oak, cherries, grapes, vinegar, and funk. Flavor is cherries, grapes, oak, funk, and vinegar, with a scetic and slightly tar finish. Complex and interesting.","Mount Laurel, New Jersey, USA","zathrus13"
3395,"2009-02-18",4.1,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2009 Bottle. Aroma of grapes, nearly smoky oak, praline, and a very bacteria-forward funk and acidity. Flavor is increasingly acidic and tart, musty, with the prevalent note still being red grapes and red wine, and a background sweetness reminiscent of creme brulee, and of course the ever-present oak. Palate is ever so mildly tannic, though certainly noticeably tannic being it a beer, and somehow gritty and earthy. Finishes with a cognac-like alcohol note. Endlessly fascinating and complex.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
3395,"2009-02-17",4.1,"Thanks to JoeMcPhee for sending this bottle my way - I was going to wait to try this beer, but I just couldnt - pours a murky red, with a nearly non-existent head - shes got a lovely aroma - cherry and grape skin tannins, potent oak, mild acetic character, vinegar, moderate earthy funk, light acidity, red wine, and just a hint of fruity sweetness underneath - the flavor is dry and immensely oaky, with loads of tannic, red wine flavor - some mild acetic notes, and an acidic kick that both compliment the dryness - a bit briny/salty through the middle, with a good amount of cheesy, earthy funk - finishes with some kriek-ish cherry character and lingering red wine vinegar, oak and acetone - I prefer the Castleton, but this is still a mighty fine sour ale from Scott.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
3395,"2009-02-17",4.5,"Bottle split two ways.  Hazy copper in color with some red highlights.  Small off white head.  Aroma is very powerful- sour cherry, earth, tannins, acetic acid/vinegar wood, a good amount of horseblanket funk, as well as some cheesy funk at times.  I could seriously just keep my nose in the glass without taking a sip for 15 minutes.  Taste is just as good as the aroma-  An explosion of tart/sour cherries, earthy, red wine vinegar, a good amount of oak, earth, and pleasant funk. Also has some nice wood and fruit tannins. A good amount of sourness throughout the taste, and it gets pretty strong in the finish, but its not over the top.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
3395,"2009-02-16",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2011 Bottle.  Pours an ugly amber brown body with a thin lacing of bubbles.  Aromatic character is just mouthwatering; cherry, dried fruit leafs, sour funkiness, lightly woody, chardonnay, and hint of grapes.  Mild sour cherry balsamic vinegar and dried fruits.  Reminiscent of one of the awesome bullfrog beers in flavor.  Very low acidity, tart lingering dull dark cherry mouth pucker with a light drying finish.  Awesome brew, i think this will continue to appreciate with time. Batch 1 4.4.
I dont have notes for batch 2.
Batch 3.   Pours a hazy orange bruin fleshy body with a yellow off white head.  Loads of cherries, funky tart and Flemish.  chewy cherries and grape notes.  Not nearly as acidic as batch 2.  Very nutty chewy finish.  Light saccrin like sweetness very complex and comes together quite well.  CL is back at it.  4.2","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
3395,"2009-02-15",4.2,"12.7 ounce bottle in Chimay glass.  Reddish with loose bubble head and a little lace.  Tart funky woody fruity aroma.  Funky brown sugar covered tart cherry grape wood with very woodsy finish.  Just enough carbonation to make it happen.  Very complex and flavorful and funky fresh delicious.

3395,"2009-02-14",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2010 Bottle, batch 1.  Pours a murky brown/amber with no real head.  Aroma is quite tart, some sweettart candies in there, and lots of oak barrel.  Flavor of nice sour, oaky notes.  Tart and acidic but light on the palate.  Nice fruity notes from the grapes.  A very nice sour and I think I prefer it to Castleton...maybe.  Well done.
8/4/9/4/17 (4.2/5)
Update 3/29/10: Bottle, batch 2.  This time got a nice, fluffy tan head.  Aroma of funk, light tartness, musty grapes, more of an ""Oud Bruin"" feel.  Flavor is tart and sweet initially with a bready, malty finish.  Tart, less acidic, and more malty than batch 1.  Grapes again are subtle but add to the sweetness of the beer.  I bumped my rating down just a touch.

The flavor matches, with an incredible lasting oak finish. Smooth on the palate, yet slightly acidic and lively.","SF Bay Area, California, USA","AgentSteve"
3395,"2009-01-18",4.2,"Unlabeled wax sealed bottle.  The brewery send to a friend.  Shared at woodshop quad.  pours orange with no head.  Nose is tart, vinegary and super funky.  Taste is tart sour funky, puckering, great, cant wait to try more of this!!","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
3395,"2009-01-12",4.5,"Bottle. My description of this beer will not do it justice. I am less versed in the sour beers, but from what I have had, this one deserves to be in the upper echelon. Super complex with tart notes, that make you smile as opposed to cringe. Has a nice woodie backbone that adds a real richness to the overall flavor. Very pleased I got to try this.","jericho, New York, USA","TeamTrappist"
3395,"2009-01-10",4.5,"Bottle.  Wow- this is actually quite a bit better than the keg I had this past summer.  The extra time has really allowed this to become even more sour and way more refined to a beautiful beer.  Pours a mostly clear medium coppery amber with an ok thin head and low carbonation (surprised this thing carbonated since it is so strong and with its rediculously low pH).  Aroma is sharp tart cherry, some nice medium to high acetic spike to the nostrils, black cherry skin, some pit, red wine vinegar, tannic and just smells like a very powerful La Folie or something similar.  Awesome raw acidic flavor, with tons of acetic acid, but not too crazy - still incredibly drinkable- with its refinement and complexity- more fruit skin and astrignetn pits, tannic, and just sour as hell at the end.  Prickly yet enjoyable mouthfeel from the acidity- and the carbonation is pretty good- wouldnt even want it to be higher.  I really wasnt that impressed when I first had it and may have given it a high 3s over the summer- but damn it is fucking good now, and when this is released it is going to go through the roof.  Insanely good.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
3395,"2008-08-19",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2010 Draft, at BCTC 2008. Poured murky brown, capped with a thin off-white head. Complex aroma of wild yeast, oak, and grapes. Flavor nicely highlighted the brett, with notes of oak, grapes, vanilla, and caramel. Tart, but not overwhelming.  Long, dry, finish, with oak and yeast the dominant flavors. Nice sour. 
Resampled a batch 2 bottle today. Oak dominates the aroma, with plenty of grape and tannin in the background. Flavor seems to be more tart than I remember. Red grapes, wood, and tannins stick around for a lengthy finish. Really great beer, Im glad I was able to grab a few for the cellar at yesterdays release.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"
3395,"2008-08-09",4.3,"On tap sampled at NFB&WF 08 at Martha Clara Vineyards. This was by far the best beer of the event, and I was pleased to see it there since it wasnt on the list published on the website for the event.  Big thank you to Scott for bringing it.  Pours a cloudy brown with some red tinting.  The aroma is delightful with lots of oak, vanilla, red wine, and yeast.  My tastebuds were all perked up after the aroma, and they were not disappointed.  Lots of oak, vanilla, red wine, yeast, nuts, and some tangy funk in the flavor.  Just the right amount of tartness.  Some smokiness at the finish that reminds me a little bit of bacon!  My wife and I both really enjoyed this one.  Another winner from Scott!","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
3395,"2008-08-06",3.0,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2009 Muddy brown colored body with a little tan head.  Fruity, tart, bready yeast nose.  Floral as well, some toast and bread mixed in with some potpourri character.  Weird twangy flavor of old crackers and soggy bread, difficult to drink, difficult to enjoy why does this taste like dogfood?  Disappointingly flabby finish.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3395,"2008-08-04",3.7,"BCTC’08. Got the first pour of tap at the fest, thanks to Scott himself (one of the perks of being a ""volunteer"").  I was shocked to see this was going to be on tap at the fest. A very dark, murky, reddish-brown color. Aroma is aged, right of the bat it comes off as ""lots o barrel;"" charred, thick, and lightly oxidized.  Scott said it spent more like 2 years in the barrel.  Some booze in there as well, then comes some ""old"" type sourness.  Fortunately, taste is more sour and less aged barrel. Lots of dark fruits mixed with dark sour beer.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
3395,"2008-08-04",4.2,"The first and one of the best beers I had at BCTC 08 during the actual fest.  Pours a hazy deeper brownish/red with a small bubbly off white head that went away pretty quickly.  Aroma of oak, funky yeast, some caramel, vanilla, sour grapes (but in an oddly good way), some wine notes and just a very interesting and complex nose.  Flavor was a lot of the same, funky yeast notes, oak, vanilla, nuts, light caramel and even some Cheerios.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
3395,"2008-08-04",3.7,"On tap at BCTC. Very excited to hear about and have this.  Poured a cloudy, slightly opaque brown with a thin white lace.  Nose is very, very oaky, with a light bretty tartness, and some dark red fruits. Flavor was similar to a bran cereal, with a lot of oak and only some light tartness underneath.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
3395,"2008-08-04",4.2,"[BCTC 08] Poured a ruddy brown red color with a small, off white head that left light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of sweet grapes, wild yeast, light almonds, vanilla, toast, some vinegar, and red wine.  Taste of cherries, sour grapes, sweeter toffee, oak, lighter vanilla, and a sour, quite wild finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
3395,"2008-08-04",4.1,"Oh hell yeah. Tap at BCTC. So rich and deep and complex. A total surprise too, there’d been no mention of this showing up at BCTC. I guess the bottle release is near, as soon as they carbonate.

Incredibly murky brown pour, decent head, with lots of yeast floaties. Bright, lively oak in the aroma with only the slightest hint of tart, this beer is a celebration of everything that comes from oak-aging and souring a nice malty Belgian beer. Flavor is loaded with buttery toffee and luscious peanut-brittle, with a clean tart underneath. Smooth vinous qualities and nice sour throughout the finish. Very reminiscent of a De Dolle ""reserva"" beer. Awesome.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

This pours an oily, dark reddish-brown color; light tan head with fine-bubbled lacing.  Enormous amounts of caramel, intense wine-tinged wood and honeyed dried fruits in the aroma; simply a gorgeous woodiness / viscous vinous character to this beer; really soft edges.  Full mouthfeel: intense, viscous; prickly carbonation and tart citrus acidity at the center of the tongue; oily heaviness, incredibly complex, soft woodiness and dried dark fruits and caramel; beautifully soft, velvety, and well-developed; very unique stuff.
