2837,"2017-03-20",3.5,"classic pilsner all the way through. from the wheaty, spicy aromatics to the crisp, refreshing lager-like finish. was a bit disappointed by how clear it poured when it was touted as an unfiltered beer. the born-on-date was over 4 months ago : /","","crispaire"

2837,"2017-01-05",4.2,"473mL can, courtesy of andrewje41 (thanks man!), pours a hazy dull yellow with a small white head. Aroma brings out grassy hops, crisp crackery malt and straw. Flavour is along the same lines, with hoppy grassy hops, dry straw and crisp crackery malt. Dry and crisp, with a hoppy grassiness on the finish. Wonderfully made. Delicious.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2837,"2016-12-18",3.4,"Can. Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly diminishing. Body is hazy light to medium yellow. Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain, sourdough bread), lightly hoppy (herbs), with notes of sulfur, concrete, DMS, lemon juice, hint of urine. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, watery/velvety texture, lively carbonation.

Pretty good rendition, even if there are some rough edges in the aroma. Theres some rusticity here that reminds one of Kellerbier, which is purty neato. If this were a bit cleaner, itd be a real winner. Bit of funny trivia...the description on the can says ""Glorial"" twice (letter ell instead of the exclamation point, and definitely not just a printing/smudging problem).","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2837,"2016-12-09",4.0,"Canned 11.08.16. A: Citrus and pollen. A: See through light yellow body. T: Flower, honey, grain, and citrusy hops add slight bitterness on the back end. P: Crisp and clean with a little resin stickiness. O: I can see why Block 15 is so popular. This is very nice!","","WABeerFiend"
2837,"2016-11-22",3.5,"UPDATED: NOV 29, 2016 From can its mostly clear gold with a short and fine head. Quiet aroma is hoppy in the way of flowers and lemongrass, lightly malty-toast and honey-ish, yeasty sulfur. In the mouth its medium bodied, rightly sweet with some plump umami frothed by fine carbonation. Its nicely mineral-y with good flavor balance, clean fermentation profile, and the mouth feel makes me wonder if they are decocting down in Corvallis. Very easy to throw back... I only wish it were more expressive.  Stamped on bottom 9/26/2016.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
2837,"2016-10-15",3.5,"Can, thanks for sharing! Pours a near clear pale yellow with a white head that dissipates quickly to the edges. Aroma has lots of straw and grass with some grains and hay backing. Flavor has straw and hay up front with grass and light pine in the finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"

2837,"2016-09-02",3.9,"16 ounce can. Pours a clear yellow color with a medium white head. Very clear. A big biscuit pils malt nose. Very clean, floral, toast, lemon citrus hops, big backbone of pils malt. This is an excellent Pilsner. Insanely quaffable.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
2837,"2016-08-18",4.6,"Beautiful grain aromas with a nice light hop making an appearance. Very hazy gold with white frothy head. Amazing wet, refreshing but such a great flavor of malt being challenged by a hop counter part. An ipa drinkers summer beer but a pilsner lover would still find plenty to enjoy.","truckee, California, USA","krumbum"
2837,"2016-08-12",3.5,"16oz can thanks to rich. Pours out a cloudy pale straw color topped with a white head. Nose is earthy grass grain and some lemon zest. Taste is more of the earthy notes along with grain malts and some cereal.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
2837,"2016-08-07",3.5,"Can in Portland. Enjoyed in my hotel room with take out Pok Pok. Quite clear, light bright gold. Lingering in foam. Dry bitter hop pils. Lots of American hop treatment. Bitter hop pils but quite nice.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
2837,"2016-07-25",4.1,"16 oz can poured to my Icicle tankard glass. I was looking forward to trying this as soon as I saw it arrive in town. I decided to opt for the single can, opposed to the 4 pack. What the hell was I thinking. This is an ideal pilsner, and belongs in my fridge. Well presented, inviting hops and grain, inoffensive aroma, which is a good start for the style. Very crisp, and maximum refreshment. Flavorful, but a light feel. Going back to get more of these. From what Ive seen, I dont see any Pils getting a whole lot better than this. File this in the raves department.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
2837,"2016-07-14",3.6,"On tap at ABV Pub on a tap takeover night. Almost clear straw yellow with a small white head and some lacing. Grass and some biscuit the nose. Taste is biased biased toward bitter, true to style. Medium mouthfeel. Bitter finish.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Brentv"
2837,"2016-06-05",3.5,"64 oz growler from ""b2"" tap house in Salem OR
$6 ( on sale)
Golden yellow coloured beer with a large rocky ,frothy pure white head.
Nice biscuity malt aroma..some hint of peppry/grassy hop.
Very balanced pilsner here..the hops are there but well balanced by the malts, Its so well balanced i fear it loses a bit and goes down like Becks which in my opinion is NOT a bad beer.
Good smooth and loose mouth feel.
A good pilsner reminds me of Becks and Bitburger.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"
2837,"2016-05-15",3.5,"UPDATED: DEC 13, 2016 Re-rate from can now that Im not knee deep in bourbon barrels.

A: Cloudy golden straw with a puffy foam of white head. 

N: Sulfur, cracker, toast, corn, lemon zest, peppercorn, pine needles, a bit of rye. Very earthy and dusty. 

T: Very dry bitterness and moderate sweetness. Fairly clean. 

M: Light body, foamy carbonation, no alcohol.

O: Decent. I was a bit surprised that my initial rating of 3.4 was pretty close to the mark. I dont think I could put this up there with Heater Allen no matter how much I would have liked to do so. I think it needs more malt to balance out the astringency.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
2837,"2016-02-06",3.2,"Draft - Soft light grains with a touch of butter. Pale gold with a decent white head. Just as it tastes with a touch of sweetness and bitterness.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2837,"2015-12-13",3.4,"Flight pour on tap at the brewpub (Corvallis, OR). Pours a gently hazed pale straw grainy hue. Lucid and lighter color with frothy brighter stark white head atop. A creamy layer dies to more of a ringer and laces mellow overall. Aromas are grainy, a bit earthy with a lemony appeal. Tart lemon rind, some pithy life and green grassy hops. Gentle bready malts, grain and Pils appeal with that subtle earthy stink. I keep coming back to the lemon. Initial is lighter bodied, dry and a bit mineral slanted. Some firmer bitterness for the style coats the palate. Pithy, earthy, a bit green up front. The middle shows a bit more dry grain, straw and subtle grassy appeal. Backend is dry, a touch fuzzy with that subtle sulfur stink and Pils malt appeal. Light, a potent bitterness hits up front with some nice lemon appeal, mineral and earthy feel. The malt bill gives some of that Pils and stinky Saaz impression as it finishes, lingering on. Not bad, certainly pretty drinkable stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2837,"2015-09-15",3.5,"Poured from tap to glass. Clear straw hue with thick white head that lingered. Aroma is straw, spicy, grass, sulphur. Mouthfeel is refreshing with a medium light body and crisp carbonation. Taste is dry with a hop bitterness following and a mineral like finish. Overall this is a good brew.","Sweet Home, Oregon, USA","Salmoniform"
2837,"2015-08-28",3.5,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a pale yellow gold with small frothy white head that lasts. The aroma is wheat grass, spruce, yeast. Medium mouth, wheat, spice, clove, lingering bitterness, very good.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
