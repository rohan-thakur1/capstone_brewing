431,"2017-05-19",3.4,"Ever so slightly hazy golden coloured body with a white head, that is barely a centimetre tall. Aroma of pure coffee, lactose, malt, toffee, sugars and somehow, more coffee - very strong scented. Light-bodied; Strong coffee flavours at first with a ton of cream and lactose with a little earth and funk with a touch of vanilla, oak and pure caster sugar with a smooth creamy finish. Aftertaste shows some grain, a bit of vanilla and fresh coriander seed and a ton of coffee flavours, but not in a bitter or aggressive manner, just the right set of flavours. Overall, a decent beer that feels and tastes odd at first, but turns out to be a good beer for the style and definitely unique. I sampled this twelve ounce can purchased from The Perfect Pour in Elk Ridge, Maryland on 28-November-2016 for US$3,99 sampled at my hotel room here in Lancaster, Pennsylvania on 19-May-2017.","Arlington (Pentagon City), Virginia, USA","jgb9348"
