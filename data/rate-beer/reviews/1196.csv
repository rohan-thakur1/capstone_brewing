1196,"2017-05-14",3.5,"22 oz. bottle, consumed on 5-5-17. Pours a cloudy bronze with a small to moderate amount of beige head. Not particularly appealing appearance, but not an off-putting one. Later pours have larger, uneven, and more impressive head and produce extensive lacing that elevates the appearance, although the liquid itself retains its uninspired dinge. Tangy, hoppy aroma features scents of lemon and apricot skin. Some dankness and grassiness in the smell. Good but underwhelming aroma. Nice, funky, dank flavor. A bit too much peach-and-orange-fruitiness in the taste for my preferences, but I do like the way this tastes. Lemon, even lime, and perhaps onion (or at least scallion). Caramelized onion flavor upon multiple sips. Caramel; maltier than most Toppling Goliath hoppy beers. That said, the underlying beer seems a bit insubstantial. Milky. Lightly chemical aspect. Soapy finish. Medium to full body. Lively. Substantial palate effects. Overall, some really nice notes in the hops, but also some I dont like as much. Not outstandingly juicy/fruity/sweet, thankfully, but a little too far in that direction for my tastes, preventing this from getting a particularly high ranking. But I do like it, although it does get tiresome upon multiple sips. Mosaic is a great hop, but most single-hop Mosaic beers are lacking in bitterness that other hops deliver much better than Mosaic does.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

1196,"2016-11-02",4.3,"22 ounce bottle from Badger Spirits in Beloit, WI, served a few minutes out of the fridge in a pint glass. Very hazy, nearly opaque palest gold, with an enormous fluffy white lasting head that laces well when it finally starts to weaken...the aroma is every bit as huge as the foam, a massive sharp grapefruit attack followed by a lovely earthy, herbal tone, hints of onion and tarragon, also a touch of something perfumy....the body offers only a modest sweetness, with that earthy, oniony texture showing up for an acidic and biting flavor throughout, culminating in a drier, slightly peppery finish...the mouthfeel is of thick, pulp-laden orange juice without the pulp, which sounds stupid but there it is - its thick, acidic, juicy, with moderate tingly carbonation. ""Luscious"" is the only word appropriate for the experience of this beer, its so...much.

There is a lot of fruit juice and tropical and citrus fruit skin and flesh. There is a nice floral hop and a hint of pine resin. Its a really interesting aroma. The flavor offers a lot more fruitiness to it with a resounding dank hoppiness. The malt pokes through a little on the beginning, but rolls out nicely.

1196,"2016-01-22",2.9,"Pours an orange-amber color with a smaller, bubbly head on top.

Smells or blood orange, peach, zingy lemon rind and a pleasant dankness, coated up by toffee malts. Herbal qualities turn more present among flowery biscuits, well balanced by juicy, ripe exotic fruits. 

Has a medium carbonation with a medium body to it, revealing an intense clash between hops an malts on the tongue. Its mouthfeel remains pleasantly creamy though, leaving all nuances of the beer detectable, due to soothing yeast.

Tastes of an initial aqueous softness, establishing the beers great mouthfeel from the kickoff, together with comforting toffee malts. In a split second malts turn absurdly sweet, while the hops try to establish a working balance by introducing garden herbs and dry lime. Finds its peak right after the swallow by producing a dough coated, piercing toffee sweetness, while overloading the palate with bitter hops at the same time. Finishes surprisingly clean, leaving behind its staggering sweetness, now focussing on lemon, prickly kiwi and juicy blood orange.

Almost overpowers my tastebuds, once the beers piercing sweetness gets established from out of nowhere, while hops accept the challenge by creating an equally powerful bitterness. This misses certainly some balance to me, to form a pleasant drinking experience. Usually I would assume a dipa being ruled by its hops, in this particular bottle its been vice versa.","GERMANY","aleigator"

The aroma is dank but at the same time very bright. Its got some nice orange and lightly melony fruit character. Its aromatic, appetizing and stinky in all the right ways. 

The flavor is a very wonderful expression of the Mosaic hop, its beautifully fruity and lightly floral with a nice light bitterness. Its got a low booziness and is moderately dry. Something so simple, yet so well executed, so tasty... so able to hit the right notes for a hoppy beer with that one hop, its a very cool beer for sure.

Caramel is there - maybe a bit sweeter and less bitter in the finish than the other. A little bit fruitier, but also a bit of weedy dankness. Light-medium body, some noticeable alcohol in the finish, and pretty dry. Overall: the two blind beers tonight (this and La Cumbre Project Dank) both ran pretty darn close to each other.

1196,"2014-03-30",3.3,"Draught at EBF, 3/22/14Pale amber gold, moderate white head. High clarity.Strong hop acids give off lots of white grapefruit and pine. Medium sweet malts combine with the citrus to produce a pretty typical candied orange nose. Leafy, fresh and almost earthy-like, though there is some sappy pine on the end that the sugars arent able to mop up. Alcohol dryness is felt on the end as well and mixes with some baked brown bread and sourdough notes.Lots of c-hop notes here. Marmalade seems the most dominant of them, as the citrus mixes with lightly dry pine resins and sourdough-like maltiness. Much less sweet/malty than the King Sue, so in that regard it goes down a bit easier, but conversely, the dryness really allows the heavy citric/pine hop assault to flag at the palate and some perfumey alcohol notes keep it pretty harsh.

Really herbal spicy, marijuana, a bit piney, strong onion/garlic hoppy flavor along with some lemon, pineapple, and guava. Fucken easy to drink and tasty.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"

1196,"2013-10-11",4.0,"22oz bomber.
Aroma is dominated by the hop character with a light cracker malt note. Hops are slightly citrusy with a tropical fruit and melon character along with a touch of white grapes. 
Pours a moderately clear pale yellow gold with a somewhat thick white head that shows pretty nice retention. Moderate lacing and medium small legs. 
Flavor starts with a moderate sweetness and a light cracker character. Moderate hop flavor, similar to the hop aroma, and moderately strong bitterness. Bitterness is soft and clean though fairly strong. Lingering bitterness with some resiny hop flavor, a hint of fruit and light cracker malt. Fairly dry finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a fairly enjoyable IPA, but I wish it had more hop flavor. I like the balanced nature of the malt and the dry finish, but it could be drier. The mosaic hop is really nice and fairly complex; Im looking forward to having a pound to brew with.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
1196,"2013-10-11",4.6,"This is the real deal, and represents an excellent example of this next gen of hop forward beers. Light thin melon and cantaloupe add a backdrop to skunk, light diesel, green onion, sulfur and touches of rose. Creamy feel. Good citric acidity. No sugar apparent in the feel. No gummy resins. Very light bitterness. Clean leaning, lightly astringent finish with a touch of bitterness. Bam. I love it.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"

Nose is slightly fruity/tropical, but mostly a general grassiness with a woody, musty nose. pours clear with a medium sized head. Hops and malt are well balanced. Not pithy and not a malt bomb od sweetness. Hop flavor is more tropical than the nose suggests. dry finish and quenching. Not as obnoxiously hoppy as I would expect.

Updated for a new bottle. More hop expression comes through than I recall but still a bit muted for a DIPA.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
1196,"2013-10-08",4.2,"22 oz. bottle from Johns Grocery- thanks for sending, Andy! Pours a clear, bright golden color with a small white cap that sticks and leaves some lace on the way down. Aroma of fresh herbs and cut grass (with a little spice), pineapple, mango, melon, tangerine, and sweet and pale malts. Flavor of pine, pineapple, spicy fresh herbs, mango, orange peel, tangerine, and sweet nectar. Medium-bodied, with moderate to medium carbonation and a resinous, fruity mouthfeel that has some coating bitterness late but dials back in intensity on the finish. Wow. Another winner. These guys do everything well.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

1196,"2013-10-02",4.3,"22oz bottle a few hours off the Hop Patrol truck, bottled on the same day! A very tasty IIPA. The mosaic hop is quite nice, reminiscent of Nelson Sauvin, Simcoe, Citra..light and earthy, with plenty of tropical fruit flavors. Some spruce too. The body is clean and drinkable, but there is so much hop flavor you want to reflect on it sip by sip. Quite a tasty IIPA, very unique and modern.  Assumably the freshest beer Ive ever had out of a bottle.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

1196,"2013-07-30",2.9,"Burnished golden. Thick and foamy white head clings to the glass after each sip. Expressive but nauseating, hop-driven aromas of grape bubblegum, rubber cement, matchstick, chalk, Lemon Pledge, white grape, pinesap, kumquat, white grapefruit, pineapple marmalade. Thickly resinous, initially, as stinging acids inundate the palate with an excessive amount of grass clippings. Quite bright and succulent, though the incessant resinous onslaught gives way to a chalkiness which shortens the hop vitality. Gooey oils follow up with an unrefined astringency which further stifles much of the brightness. Loads of hop flavor agreeably dovetails with the well-composed bitterness, though. Malt quietly looms in the background with a very light, white bread dryness. Mild note of sulfur accompanies a matchstick harshness which further deadens much of the hop vibrancy, though a pineapple marmalade suppleness does persist nicely. Alcohol lends considerable causticity which exacerbates the chalkiness. Fatiguingly acidic after a few swallows, and the hops become limp, akin to wet grass clippings. Finishes intensely grassy with uncured hay flavors fused with white grapefruit and a splash of nectarine. Quite a mixed bag. On the surface, it seems quite lovely. But once you sit with it and do some delving, a number of blemishes are difficult to overlook. I prefer DIPA tilted toward hop flavor rather than unruly and bitter, and this has plenty of tropical-fruit allure to hold your interest for at least a few sips. But the hops used here fare poorly when used to points of excess, as flaws like chalk and matchstick start to become apparent, not to mention grapefruit and pinesap, ick. Kudos to the brewer for using mostly pale malt and keeping the sweetness at bay, but ultimately this is another unrefined DIPA (to my tastes, that is) with a misguided hop treatment. Thanks to heykevin for the generous gift.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Drinking this again fresh, Ive gotta up the score from 3.7.  Gorgeous appearance, sticky lace, perfectly carbonated (not too high :D).  Billowing Mosaic aroma knock my nose on its back.

Flavor is the same, wonderfully fruity hop notes on top of a very light sweetness and surprisingly light bitterness given how powerful the hop aromas are.

The aroma is something that I have only smelled in the top tier beers coming out of California. Straight up tropical fruit. Really, really amazing. Throw away all your preconceptions about what kind of beer can be made in Iowa these days, because this thing gets it right in every category that matters.

1196,"2013-05-03",4.3,"22 oz bottle courtesy of randomgarbage. Thank you, Andy. 3 days since bottling tops. Pours a richer orange amber hue, faint haze and cakey bright white head atop dies to a firm layer, sticks around ok and laces the same. A good golden orange glow throughout the body. The aromas.. are just ridiculous. Fresh rich Mosaic hops preach grapefruit, big tropical fruit presence, melon and white grape. Big florals, papaya and mango, grapefruit rind and fruit. Lemons, oranges, and big bitter dry florals. Tiny maltbill stays in the back. Just a really rich fruity nose explodes from the pour, from the glass, mangos and tropical fruit, citrusy grapefruit and lemon meld well and throughout. Initial is lighter end of medium bodied, surprisingly dry off the bat. Smaller body shows some crisp dry bready and cereal grains, firm dry bitterness, some fuzzy fruit, citrus, but bigger floral and earthy bitter slant. Some white grape, mango, and firm to strong dryness. Im pretty surprised by how small the malt body is here, light and dry, quite easily consumed. Middle shows some fruit, citrus rind, lemon, and touches of melon. Some firm dry and bitter elements take off into the backend. Earthy dry slant, crisp and clean dry and bitter finish is quite enjoyable. Nothing is overstated here. Its clean, dry, and bitter. Some good flavors of grapefruit juice, faint pine, firm bitter dry finish cleans up well. I dig this. The nose explodes while the beer, instead of preaching a boatload of sweetness is clean, finely tuned, firmly dry and bitter without getting clunky and turn into a big fruit bomb. Very well done here. Its not just the hop here. The base really is a good one. This slots into my Top 5 DIPAs with the heavy hitters of the category (Russian River, Hill Farmstead, Three Floyds). Thats a statement Im comfortable making.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

1196,"2013-05-02",4.5,"Bottle.
Aroma: loads of tropical fruit and citrus, juicy grapefruit, a solid punch of pine, just a touch of malt in the background, some floral and perfume notes.
Appearance: mostly clear light golden pour, fluffy white head with good retention and lacing.
Taste: wow.  Exceedingly clean and hops aplenty.  Lots of ripe mango, zesty grapefruit, some resin/pine going on.  Light cracker malt character, just enough to support the hop charge.  Alcohol is dangerously well hidden, almost imperceptible, and for the advertised IBU, the bitterness takes a back seat to the hop flavors and this finishes smooth as silk.  Nice and dry, clean as can be.
Palate: light-medium body, medium carbonation, very smooth, dry and clean finish.
