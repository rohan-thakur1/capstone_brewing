4463,"2017-06-18",2.7,"Aventinus, the Wheat Doppelbock of Bavaria, has always been known to be the most intense and complex wheat beer in the world. This was the case for the past sixty years, but not anymore... Up until the 1940’s, Aventinus was shipped all over Bavaria in containers lacking temperature control. Consequently, the precious drink partially froze during transportation. Unaware that the brew was concentrated by the separation of water from the liquid. People were baffled by this unique version of Aventinus. By chance, the first Aventinus Eisbock was created. Well aware of this story, Hans Peter Drexler, brewmaster of the Schneider brewery, decided to recreate this classic ""mistake"" in a modern controlled facility. Thus, the Aventinus Eisbock is reborn sixty years later ... Prost!

4463,"2017-06-06",4.1,"(330ml bottle) Aroma: Strong for sure, some fenols (kinda like in belgian beers), sweeteness, caramel, no alcohol. Complexed. 
Appearance: Nice, quite big head, dark and unclear liquid.
Taste: Sweet and slightly sour. In flavour is very complexed, there is wheat, caramel, fenols too, slightly malty and breadish.
Palate: Medium to full body, oval and creamy texture, fizzy carbonation (definitelyy too much carbonated).
Overall: Great beer, for sure, aroma wasnt that astonishing, but in mouth the beer is simply amazing (carbonation is bad though) - complexed, full of flavours, no alcohol at all - simply amazing. Maybe I would prefer some more bocks typical flavours, but still - amazing.

4463,"2017-03-14",4.0,"Lallure dune Doppelbock en plus ""dense"", brune et troublée, avec une mousse fine beige. Au nez, aucune surprise quand on est un amateur de la Aventinus Doppelbock, hormis lalcool beaucoup plus présent. On retrouve avec joie les notes de malt caramel, le blé, les céréales omniprésentes, le côté chocolat au lait, la noix, des traces de coriandre, des notes damande et de praline, de pain viennois, la banane (grosse charge), le pruneau, la poire pochée et la pomme cuite... La complexité est moyenne mais léquilibre est superbe. En bouche, la claque ! La première gorgée sarticule directement sur les malts et les saveurs associées tandis que quelques secondes plus tard, lalcool monte soudainement en puissance et vous ""cuit"" la cavité buccale. La carbonatation est faible (compte tenu du processus de fabrication ce nest pas une surprise), lamertume sobre, la texture ronde. Non, ce qui ressort vraiment sur les gorgées suivantes, cest lalcool. Alors attention, point de méprise cher(e-s) lecteur(s)/lectrice(s) ! Cest un alcool de très haute volée avec des saveurs exquises, mais elles ont justement tendance à voler la vedette au reste. Le final est sur lalcool évidemment, et on sent vraiment le côté éthanol genre vodka. Jaime beaucoup les bières alcoolisées car généralement elles ont vraiment du corps. Celle-ci ne déroge pas à la règle à ceci près que ce nest pas une Belge Forte, un Barley Wine ou un Imperial Stout. On ne retrouve pas la richesse aromatique des genres cités précédemment, ce qui nest guère surprenant quand on connait lhistorique de la fabrication de cette bière artificiellement chargée en alcool.

4463,"2016-11-10",4.1,"Data ważności: 29.01.2021 
 Kolor:  Ciemnobrunatny. Pod światło cała masa rubinowych refleksów. 
 Piana:  Drobnopęcherzykowa, potem średniopęcherzykowa, dość szybko opada w dół. Ma ona rzadko spotykany kolor kości słoniowej.
Piana po pewnym czasie redukuje się do cieńkiego krążka. Po zakręceniu szkłem wyraźnie widać ""płaczące łzy"" spływająca po ściankach Sniftera. 
 Zapach:  Ewidentnie słodowy. Mnóstwo tutaj aromatów melanoidowych (skórka od chleba, tosty). Nie brakuje także wędzonych śliwek i rodzynek.
Wyraźnie wyczuwalna jest także drzewna wędzonka, której się tutaj kompletnie nie spodziewałem.
Po ogrzaniu nawet dość mocno dominuje.
Nie zabrakło także karmelowych, 
a nawet lekko czekoladowych detali.
Początek jest bardzo zachęcający. 
 Smak:  Na języku górują słodowe niuanse.
Najmocniej wyczuwalne są wędzone śliwki, ale nie brakuje także wiśni i czereśni.
Dużo tutaj również rodzynek, lekkie toffi i odrobina czekolady z nadzieniem.
Melanoidowe posmaki co jakiś czas przemkną przez usta.
Eisbock ma bardzo gęstą teksturę. Nalewa się jak olej silnikowy.
Piwo jest pełne w smaku z średnią goryczką.
Posmaki alkoholowe są widoczne, ale nie są one ani rozpuszczalnikowe, ani gryzące.
Ekstemalnie mocne, ale nie od alkoholu, bardziej od pełni i treściwości.
Bez dwóch zdań świetne piwo. 
 Wysycenie:  Niskie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Eisbock jest rodzajem mocnego Podwójnego Koźlaka (Doppelbock).
Nazwa pochodzi od procesu wymrażania w celu zatężenia piwa.
Piwo zamraża się, a następnie powstały lód usuwa, aby zwiększyć zawartość alkoholu.

Bardzo bogate, pełne, słodowe piwo w którym dominują aromaty i posmaki melanoidowe (tosty, skórka chlebowa), toffi, karmel, rodzynki, ciemne owoce (śliwki, wiśnie), lekka czekolada.
Zaskoczeniem dla mnie były mocno wyczuwalne w aromacie, przyjemne nuty drzewnej wędzonki.
Tekstura jest potężna, a pełnia wysoka.
Aventinus Eisbock to bardzo ciekawe i pyszne piwo deserowe, które umili każdemu czas w zimny, deszczowy wiczór.
Polecam każdemu, gdyż jest to rzadki i niedoceniony styl.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

4463,"2016-08-20",4.1,"330 ml bottle bought at Running Beers booth at HKCEC in Wan Chai during HKTDC Food Expo 2016.
Looks: Cloudy hazy murky straw brown colour with a thick layer of dark brown yeast sediments; One quarter finger head with off-white foam which lasted for 30 seconds; Fair sticky lacing and zero carbonation.

Aroma: Fragment malt, with strong wheat and tartness, strong banana, strong plums, vanilla, molasses, phenolic, cloves, spices, bread and strong yeast. 

Taste: Mid to strong sweet dark malt, with moderate roastyness, strong alcohol, liquorices, strong wheaty tartness, strong plums, banana, strong phenolic, strong caramel, strong molasses, cloves, strong spices, bread , strong yeast, lemon, quite strong bitter hops and strong grass. 

Body: Full body. Thick and slightly oily palate.

Mouth Feel: Almost Belgian-like dark maltyness in an oily background with strong wheaty tartness from its Weizenbock base. Alcohol hit fast but followed but strong plums, caramel, banana, strong cloves and strong spices. Sweetness is there but surprisingly light for the style. Even more amazing is the strong lemon and grassy hop to round. This is magical!

Boozyness: the 12% abv is undetectable in aroma, and despite a hard first impression in taste, it tends not to scream too loud and doesnt burn, but fairly warm and comfy, very easy to drink. Excellent!

Hoppiness: Spices in nose. Lemon, strong spices and strong grass in taste. Bitterness - hops and liquorices - is squite trong for an abrupt, mid astringent caramel finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Boozy, fruity and quite bitter to mouth.

Comments: This freezed Weizenbock is a template of great Eisbock - strong but fresh dark fruity aroma, surperbly-managed and expressed alcohol, strong cloves and spicyness, and expressive lemony hops at high abv. All that comes with low sweetness and strong tart wheat. As an Eisbock and a strong beer, this is an art!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

There are actually a number of carbonation above average for a beer somewhat licorosa, but not misaligns the structure of the beverage.
The aroma reveals a malt with hints of raisins or prunes perhaps a festive Christmas Eve presenting yourself to the great elixir that to come. Even the aroma could notice a caramelized malt somewhat apparent, with the wheat that appears in the background is complemented with the emergence of an alcoholic content.
As for taste, and taste, follows a great Malted liqueur. Like the TAP6 the same brewery, however there is a greater tenacity and complexity involved, where I could see the slightly toasted wheat, but is very soft and perhaps masked by alcoholic power that is in resonance with a balanced yeast. The set is sweet by juicy plums that heat and cherish our chest. Intense throughout the tasting where álccol increases its presence along the gulps generating that delicious warming.
Its medium carbonation texture, velvety and liqueur with a suitable body to the beer type generating a pleasant feeling.
The aftertaste is sweet and fruity and slightly astringent with the right presence of alcohol tone. Remember that alcohol was very well inserted in the set.
A beautiful and complex beer to taste with calm and at the right time, say below 24 degrees Celsius.

Aroma: Marzipan, clove, banana, and much more, that I have a hard time to describe. Taste: Overwhelming... Almost a little too much of everything. Sweetness was the foremost. Also a considerable amount of alcohol warmth. But less direct than this sounds.-- Comparing this directly with the Aventinus: much less hops, much more sweetness.

The Kulmbacher is a barley brew and the Schneider is a weisse, probably accounting for its mild deficiencies in the strong beer category. From our flowery friends at BA, I offer another expert judgement:

 Caramel sweetbuns with toffee topping mixed with alcohol spice/fruit cake makes a medium strength and very alluring aroma.

There was barely any head other than a thin tan coloured layer and not much lacing. Aromas were of sweet plum, grape, bubblegum, caramel with some light booze. Taste was dark fruits, grape, plum, prune, bubblegum and syrup. Mid to full bodied with high carbonation. Overall, this was my first Eisbock and a very good one at that.

4463,"2015-10-05",3.9,"11.2-oz. bottle. Rich plum and fig jump out immediately, creating a heavy bouquet. Spoiled banana esters, clove, yeasty dough, fresh pear, cinnamon raisin, and a trace of black pepper also waft up from the soap-suds-like head that tops the murky purplish-brown liquid. A boozy raisin flavor rushes hard over the palate before a spicy herbal tone pops up to alleviate the richness. A bit of botanical blend joins complex notes of prunes and woody pear. The heat (from both the alcohol and the spiciness) complements the sweet fruity flavors well, but the burn becomes a tad too dominant after a while. Lively carbonation keeps the slick mouthfeel dancing over the taste buds before a peppery dry finish brings it all to a halt.

I want to call bull on the origin story (a shipment partially froze in unheated transport during the 1930s). Yes, partial freezing will concentrate the flavour by removing water - kind of the opposite of the Angels Share alcohol loss - but that only works if you remove the ice. It doesnt work with a sealed container that will rupture during freezing. Maybe, just maybe, a wooden barrel would expand enough to allow partial freezing - but youd still have to remove the water ice before drinking... Though, now it occurs to me that if you just had a chunk of ice still present in the barrel when you tapped it... hmmm... OK, maybe its viable. Regardless of the validity of the origin story, this is one heckuva beer. Flavours are very similar to an Abt - deep, dark, and rich - and despite the huge ABV, are extremely palatable. And man, does the ABV sneak up on you! This is a great beer to get very, very drunk with - or better yet, to get someone else very, very drunk with. (16/20)","CANADA","UXO"

The flavor profile is world class and packs a wallop. It begins with a wave of dark fruit, that is mostly prune, over a clove background that is always present. As the prune fades, a balancing malt sweetness emerges. The middle becomes a bit medicinal from the alcohol and has a subtle bitterness underneath.

Kolor brunatno-brazowy, ciemny. Aromat bardzo intensywny i zlozony. Estrowe, ciemne owoce - sliwki, wisnie, intensywny banan i przyprawowosc glownie gozdzikowa, Do tego chlebowo-ciastowe zapachy. ROwniez rodzynki, moze nawet delikatne figi suszone. Wszystko to z likierowym alkoholem. Troche drozdzowych i zbozowych nut. Po ogrzaniu sie, pojawia sie wiecej nieco bimbowego alkoholu i karmelu. Smak dosc mocno alkoholowy (zwlaszcza w posmaku), przy czym alkohol ten generalnie nie jest jakis negatywny, jest przyzwoicie wkomponowany w calosc, troche a la quadrupele. Jest i slodko (cukier trzcinowy) i kwaskowato (pszenicznie). to co w aromacie zasadniczo tez jest analogiczne do smaku. goryczki jako takiej nie ma, ale dlugie wybrzmiewanie alkoholowe, likierowe, owocowe niejako ja zastepuje. W ustach lepkie, w miare pelne(choc bez szalenstw, w tym temacie spodziewalem sie wiecej). W trakcie picie kolejne lyki potrafia sie mocno roznic, spektrum ""skojarzeniowe"" od skondensowanego dunkela po owocowy quadrupel ;) Niewatpliwie nie jest to piwo codzienne, sesyjne. Wrecz do pewnego stopnia mi nie pasujace, jako zbyt alkoholowe. Ale zarazem jest w nim cos, co zapewne - na ile sie uda - skloni mnie do powtorzenia. Ma charakter. Niewatpliwie, cos, czego wrecz wypada sprobowac.update 21.02.15 - przy powtorce robi niemniejsze wrazenie niz przy pierwszym piciu....kolejna proba pod mosteczkiem, potwierdza wszystko co wyzej, tym razem mam wrazenie mocniejszych gozdzikow po roku na polce (w dosc wysokiej temperaturze) wiecej kwaskowatych, pszenicznych posmakow... i to dosc wyrazna zmiana. zmienia to piwo, ale nie robi go ani troche gorszym :) Ocena potraktowana skryptem do przeliczania ocen (uzgodnienie UT/RB).Schneider Weisse G.

4463,"2015-01-04",3.6,"11.2 oz. bottle, consumed on 1-4-15. I bought this beer within the last few weeks, so, unless it was on the shelf at the store for a long time, it shouldnt have much age on it. Medium brown with slight maroon hue. Hazy. Large amount of long-lasting, smooth taupe head with the slightest lavender tint. Good-looking beer. Tart, citric aroma features scents of toffee, orange, and gingerbread. The aroma is good but somewhat disappointing, as it is not outstandingly complex or strong. Very interesting, malty taste. Flavors of licorice, toffee, ginger, gingerbread, orange, molasses, brown sugar, cookie, and various spices. Quite strong, and I feel the alcohol burn in my throat. Medium to full body (not as full as ABV would suggest, but quite full for a wheat beer). Smooth and soft in the palate. Overall, this is a good beer, and it does have a unique taste, but it doesnt rise above the field as I was hoping and expecting. I have been wanting to get around to this beer for a long time, and Im glad I tried it, but I cant help but be disappointed even while enjoying the beer in an absolute sense (though not relative to my high expectations).","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

You get the bananas but with some sweet red fruit,clove and spices. Alcohol clearly present in the finish and mainly to boost it even further.

4463,"2014-11-14",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2017 There arent many Eisbocks in their own country of origin and this is a relatively new one, but already a classic. Pours a very deep and dark mahogany brown colour, cloudy, under a crackling, light beige, moussy head slowly dissolving under influence of the considerable ABV but nevertheless retaining quite well; upon opening the bottle, it slowly creeped up the neck, so a certain form of gushing can be observed here. Powerful aroma of intense maltiness and fruitiness, overripe bananas and banana liqueur, the kind of chocolate sauce one pours over a dame blanche, amaretto, kahlua, butterscotch, cloves, something vaguely animalistic (leather?), raisins, candied dates, slight wheatiness, pipe tobacco, Belgian chocolates, brown rhum, cinnamon, apple cake, sour apple peel, fresh oranges, bayleaf. Taste immediately attacks with a big but noble sweetness, candied fruits and bananas everywhere, oily, thick and near syrupy mouthfeel, chocolate sauce, caramel candy, medium carbonation, smooth and evolving into a rich finish of profound and chewy bittersweet chocolatey maltiness, sugary liqueur effects with strongly warming, drying but not obnoxious alcohol, a light wheaty sourishness with enlightening effect and a gentle but noticeable, herbal hoppiness; the caramelly sweetness is what lasts the longest. Fantastic and a must taste for those who appreciate thick and big, dark, sweet ales; its deep chocolatey maltiness is somewhat reminiscent of the best of Belgian trappist abts or dark Christmas ales.

This is a deliciously sweet malt bomb, no doubt, but seriously good. Banana, clove, spices, booze, bubblegum, sweet bread, ripe plums and dates all hit the nose and tongue in spades.

4463,"2014-10-24",4.1,"Bottle (330 ml). Vintage 2010. Courtesy of Jürgen, thanks! Murky amber brown with a small beige head and very little lacing.

4463,"2014-10-21",5.0,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2014 Poured from a bottle, into a bell glass, at 40 degrees F.

A: The pour is a cloudy dark brown, like old hickory wood. A thick head of very pale tan forms atop the beer, though lacing is more or less nonexistent (forms quickly, then slides right down the side of the glass). Nigh no light gets through the beer, just enough to let one know this is a seriously dark brown, cloudy brew. Bubbles rise slowly as it sits in the glass.

S: While I am tempted to simply write ""awesome in the true sense of the word"", thats not exactly helpful. The aroma is malt in all its best forms - toasty, bready toffee caramel goodness. Notes of banana and raisin wreathe through the nose beneath the malt bouquet.

T: Perfect.Toast, cracker, warm whole grain bread, caramel, and toffee, all singing in perfect harmony. Sweetness is undiluted in this beer. Fruity notes pull through as it moves along the palate, bananas and raisins spiced with clove and coriander, and some black cherries. The finish lasts a long while, toffee-slathered toast. The alcohol content is present, but as a background note, adding primarily the warmth.

M: Rich silk syrup, dancing lively and sparkling across the palate, sticking to every surface long after it passes.

O: This is one of my favorite beers brewed, ever, if not my absolute favorite. And yes, Ive had BCBS, Ola Dubh Special Reserve 30, St Bernardus Abt 12, Espresso Aged Yeti, Celebrator...I would order this over any of those.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Pinana- praktycznie zerowa, po bokach utrzymująca się otoczka;

4463,"2014-08-28",4.3,"Transfer from BA review on 2-22-12-
 Poured from bottle into a snifter glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a brown/mahogany color with a small creamish colored head. The head fades rather quickly leaving a decent level of lacing on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is sweet and malty with a strong showing of an alcohol aroma. The sweeter aromas are largely stone fruit in nature with cherry, plum, and raisin all present and strong. The malty smells are a nice mix of wheat and a bready smell with the boozy alcohol aroma rounding out the sweeter and maltier smells, giving the beer a very inviting smell.

 Taste- The taste is robust and big as would be expected for a 12 % abv brew with the flavors following the nose very well. It starts with a wheaty and dark fruit flavor upfront which creates a backbone for other flavors to come and go upon. Toward the middle the fruit flavors intensify some as more cherry enters the taste while a yeasty and spice flavor complement wheat taste at this time as well. Along with the fruit so too comes nice flavors of caramel and toffee, which get stronger more toward the end of the taste. More toward the end and along with the caramel and toffee comes a alcohol taste. While it starts out more moderate it grows in strength more toward the end in the taste. The flavors mix and mingle on the tongue to in the end leave a very satisfyingly sweet but balanced boozy and lightly spiced flavor on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel- The body of the brew is quite thick and creamy with a very soothing feeling on the tongue as the creamy body and lighter carbonation create a full mouthfeel. This feel is quite nice for all the rich ad boozy flavors of the brew, making for a nice sipping and warming brew.

 Overall  A somewhat obscure brewing style done very well. This is one quite tasty brew and well worth a try.","","Darkmagus82"

As expected, very boozy on the nose, though this is countered by a significant smokey note and a lot of honey, dark fruits, caramel malts and spices. Taste is rather spicy and smokey as well, providing an overlay to the strong undercurrent of sourdough bready malts, cheesy yeasts, caramel, dark fruits and of course, alcohol. Something of a tingler due to the surprisingly significant carbonation and the spices, and obviously rather full-bodied and viscous.

4463,"2014-05-22",4.1,"Just found my notes on this.
I poured this into a weizen glass.
The appearance was a nice dark brown to almost black color with a decent one to two finger white foamy head that dissipated within about thirty seconds and ends up leaving a decent amount of foamy lacing.
The smell was wheaty yet had a nice allocation of dark chocolate malts and some nice banana coming out to assist in a wonderful aroma.
The taste was basically sweet through the chocolate and banana and the wheat ended up backing all of that up in a decent manner. There was no aftertaste and yet there was a slight dry sweet banana finish.
On the palate, she sat about a medium in body and wanted to show a decent sessionable quality to it, but for the most part, it really wasnt. I sipped this and enjoyed it thoroughly that night I had it.

4463,"2014-04-03",4.0,"330mL bottle poured into a teku glass. The tart, and sweet, fruit aromas come through in force right off the pour. Its a very bright berry-like aroma; kinda like sweet red grapes, blueberries, and raisins (maybe even some chocolate. It reminds me quite a bit of a sweet red wine. Theres also some hints of wood, or maybe its more of a smokey or charcoal character. Some citrus creeps into the aroma as it settles with some vanilla and some flowery notes come through, along with a faint alcohol suggestion. The pour is a fairly ugly, very murky (nearly opaque), dull wood-brown color that does have some effervescence to it. The head is a consistent, small-bubble, tight, neat, evenly spaced pillow-like texture that leaves a healthy, puffy ring behind, but a very runny lace. The taste is a high / medium-high sweetness, with a touch of bitter at the finish - very much in the vane of a sweet red wine. The very soft, and crazy active, abundant carbonation combine with the full, rich body to create a very creamy mouthfeel with a fruity stickiness.

4463,"2014-03-13",3.6,"Nut brown color, with a decent white head, leaving no lacing. 

Aromas of hazelnut, banana, malt, plums, not as intense as the Aventinus. 

Malt driven, supported by yeast and banana flavor, with a lot of spicy cloves and alcohol, enwrapped by sugar. Alcohol becomes too present for my taste as the malt sweetness begins to vanish, gets supported only by sugar. Beer turns from very sweet to sharp bitter in a split-second, due to the alcohol. Carbonation is fine, supporting the body of the beer. Oily, honeyed mouthfeel. This may just be a little too extreme for my taste, I dont find many nuances in this beer, as my tongue seems to get numb by the obvious alcohol. First impression is surprisingly refreshing, medium-bodied, fruity and warm. Then my palate gets hammered by lots of sugar, followed by alcohol and alcoholic bitterness, which warms my belly.

Although I dont love it, I have to admit that the beer by itself is somehow convincing. Its something you should take your time with, to adjust to the taste and furthermore the goal of the beer. As this is the first warm week of Spring in this year, I find it hard to imagine the streets around my room covered in snow. But I think thats when you should drink this, to warm yourself up. When it is very, very cold. And you dont mind a sugar rush, followed by an alcohol overdose, because it fits to the overall situation. This is a special beer for special ocasions, you shouldnt drink it as an every day beer. Get ready for it, and try to enjoy.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Flavor is fairly sweet with quite a bit of dark caramel and toffee. Moderately high chocolate notes with faint roast. Lower toasted bread notes than in the aroma. Lighter fruit nous than in the aroma. Medium light raisin and prune along with faint berry and fig. Medium light bitterness. Finish has some alcohol spice, faint roast and toasted bread along with faint chocolate and moderate raisin. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a pretty enjoyable beer with a really nice malt character and a light, but balanced fruit character. The alcohol is well hidden behind the malt sweetness. The beer is dominated by malt and Maillard reactions - if that is your thing you will like the beer. Not much yeast character.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

4463,"2014-02-07",4.6,"Like an exploding bomb of aromas, Aventinus Eisbock catched me with its complex fruity notes at first. Overgained, but lovely level of isoamyl acetate creates a fight between the banana, fig and some lurking roasted malt notes. At this point it reminds me the infamous St Bernardus ABT 12. Appearance is perfect too, a near-black body with a thick, creamy tan head. In the taste, mainly plum, fig and a little chocolate rule, bitterness and the high level of alcohol are both almost unrecognizable. Palate is heavy, long lasting, and the fine carbonation helps to avoid this beer from being too sweet or syrupy. I found this one way more similar to Belgian quadrupels than to weizenbocks or doppelbocks; but if I dig deeper, as far as I know, not only those are also include a big part of wheat in the malt base, the retained use of hops, the yeast strains and fermentation processes are similar too, so the resemblance makes sense as well. Finally, this one is definitely among the best beers Ive tried, ever.","Budapest, HUNGARY","blackhorn"

4463,"2014-01-28",3.7,"Aroma - the aroma takes on a caramel-like malt, alcohol, rich spice
Appearance - color is a very dark reddish-brown, that has a 1/2"" head that falls to white halo.
Taste - the taste is more toward the heavy sweet side, with a light bitterness as well. Of course the alcohol pops off, and when you explore the nuances further you get intense doppelbock richness. It gives off flavors like black cherry, black currant, and curaçao spice. Its super complex, and the further through it you pick up more nuances - such as cake.
Palate - body is full, the texture is thick, the carbonation appropriate for bocks, doppelbocks, and eisbocks. The finish is really impactful. Its strong and hangs on for quite some time. It has an alcohol warming effect with you.

Much like bocks, doppelbocks, and scottish ales, sweet just doesnt agree with me in beer. With that said, I can be objective, and this was not a chore for me - it is a very nice beer.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"

Der Geruch ist sehr schwer-malzig, der Schaum dunkelgelb und sehr cremig. 
Schon der Antrunk ist sehr schwer & alkoholreich. Im Hauptteil entfalten sich schon fast weinartige Aromen, allerdings ist für mich im Hauptteil noch keine alkoholische Schärfe wahrnehmbar. Die alkoholische Note im Hauptteil ist zwar nicht zu ""überschmecken"", aber ich empfinde sie nicht als sonderlich störend. 
Der Nachgeschmack ist sehr süß und klebrig. Eine ganz leichte Schärfe ist im allerletzten Teil des Nachgeschmacks vorhanden und hält sich relativ lange auf der Zunge. 
--> ein sehr interessantes Bier, das man allerdings nur in sehr kleinen Schlucken trinken kann. Und auch würde es besser in die kalte Jahreszeit passen, als zu einem 27° warmen Sommerabend. 
Trotzdem ein schöner Eisbock.

Sweetness was there: dark fruit, bananas, cloves, mild wine flavor. Heavy carbonation and mild alcohol on the backbone. 2008 on the other hand tasted like wine. Much less carbonation than the 2012; grape, port wine flavor was MUCH more prominent. We let my friends dad who isnt as much of an experienced beer drinker taste test these and he said if he didnt know this was beer he would have thought it was wine. Alcohol at the end was a little more prominent in the 2008 as well. Overall, very interesting beer. Definitely recommended. I personally liked the 2008 bottle better and if you can find one that old Id suggest you try it.","New York, USA","tambrico"

Smell: Starts with figs, plums, raisins, then the alcohol notes hit the nerves, feels like you smell these dried fruit soaked in rum - sweet and potent. There is a hint of light acidity - almost wine like, and some apple, fusel notes. Soaked with rich sweetness.


Taste: Fat and rich. Starts with in rum soaked raisins, plums, prunes, reminds of plum wine or maybe Porto and some boozy notes in there. Rich medium/heavy sweetness, munich, caramel dominate. There is a hint of banana and light acidity. It gets a little spicy, probably doe to the high alcohol content which kicks out towards the end but isnt annoying - it sums up all the flavors in a complete image. Gets yeasty towards the end.

Aroma: Sweet dark fruits (plums, cherries, dates, figs, currants) initially, mixed with some sweet malt and honey. Slight unfermented wort aroma appears, and some caramelised sticky-bun type notes.

Taste: There was a lot going on here. The same dark fruit in the aroma, but the taste is almost as if they were stewed and candied. Very smooth malt and caramel, with rich juicy Port / Torquay aspects as well. Honey, brandy, grape skins, and a herbal aspect in the aftertaste. Warmth from the alcohol helps boost the aftertaste, and helps offset the sweetness. Well balanced bitterness.

Mouthfeel: Medium-full body with medium-low carbonation. Thick and rich, but never heavy. If I had to pick any flaw, maybe a little astringent and a little too dry.

Overall: This is probably the best beer that I have had in a long, long time. It is extremely satisfying, amazingly balanced, and just so drinkable. It is something that can truly be appreciated sip-by-sip, like a fine wine or liqueur. I am interested in seeing how this one does with some age on it.","AUSTRALIA","Machalel"

4463,"2013-01-22",3.6,"Reviewed 1/9/2013.11.2 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip. 2010 vintage.

A: Pours a very dark brown with good opacity due to the haziness of the yeast. Huge yeast particles settle on the bottom of the glass. This features really impressive head retention for 12% - I poured it about 4 minutes ago and theres still a solid off-white colored film left on top.

S: The first thing I notice is huge dark fruit sweetness, along with lighter fruit esters and even some faded hops. After a while, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, and chocolate will enter the picture. Theres a noticeable oxidation to the aroma, giving it both a stronger fruit vibe along with an underlying soy note to it. The alcohol presence is mercurial; its about what I expected.

T: Flavors start off with a lot of ripe cherries and wheat malt. Afterwards, it shows hints of soy sauce (in a mild, pleasing fashion), chocolate, ripe pear, and apple. Not quite as deep, or even as intensely flavored as I expected. Once it warms up, it becomes more and more boozy without really contributing much complexity, and after a while becomes even sweeter; though it also becomes spicier in the finish as well. So yeah, this does have a bit of complexity and depth to it. Warts and all, this is a hell of an experience - and honest to God, its enjoyable.

M: At the first sip, its just about the silkiest damn thing Ive ever put in my mouth. After a while, it becomes a bit more astringent and even boozy. Combined with the carbonation, it features that subtle airy sponge cake quality to the texture. While its hard for me to taste the alcohol, its very easy to notice on the tongue, esophagus, and stomach - the syrupy finish doing its job to an extent.

O: Fresh, Im sure the booze would knock my tongue out, but its done a good job of evolving into something soft and mellow...ish. I seriously cant imagine how boozy this would be with only a month or two of age on it. The warmer it gets, the harsher it gets - and the less I want to drink it. Worth a try, but drink cold!","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

4463,"2013-01-06",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2014 50cl bottle to weizen glass.

Aroma: Fantastic! Plums, banana, clove, cinnamon, nuts, spices, flower bouquet...you could go on and on. The complexity is quite high. Then you have the classic weizen aromas too.

Appearance: Muddy dark chestnut color with a very dense, foamy, cream colored head. Much CO2 rising up. 

Taste: One of the strongest and most powerful beers Ive ever tried, bar none. So much flavour, mostly balanced on the sweet and malty side of things. Pretty much mirrors the aroma.

Palate: Viscous, chewy and very complex. CO2 is somewhat hidden and the alcohol does make itself known in the finish but overall its very good.

Overall: This beer is fantastic, almost too much, since its so complex and drinks so easily that its ridiculous. You get 50cl as opposed to 33cl AND the price is great which makes it even better. The ABV is quite high too but surprisingly hidden so watch out! The thing that amazes me most is the sheer quality of this...IMO it matches the work of the trappists and dare I say its right on par with Westvleteren 12 if not even better.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","RD400F"

Aroma - Rich, cereally, dark vine fruits, raw brown sugar, bit soy, warm spices & wood. Bit of a yeasty, sharp, sour aroma. Taste - Initially some dark, caramelised sugary / molasses sweetness and dark fruits (dates), but quickly turning drier: More dry and sour than i was expecting; Quite a sour finish - a bit like dry white wine. Quite a strong, volatile-aromatic, solvent-like taste/aroma and some appleness. Bit boozy. Quite a rich, complex wheaty malt. Also some complex, warming spicy, fruitiness if left on the tongue for a while. Body is quite light, bit lively on the tongue - surprising for the strength.

4463,"2012-07-18",4.1,"This beer is a very dark brown, almost black liquid, which is quite opaque and has a frothy dark tan head that subsides quickly. There is noticeable sediment. The aroma is of coffee and chocolate, as well as alcohol and raisins. Smelling this beer was amazingly appetizing. The taste has an elegant sweetness, that goes well with some sourness. This beer is definitely an extra-full bodied beer, with a thick, slightly oily texture, soft carbonation and a long, sweet finish. There is a lot of beer in the bottle, when poured it had a strong alcohol odour, and the aftertaste has an oily alcohol presence. That said, the thick sweet taste is absolutely delicious. I want to say that this is quite a meal in a cup, and is definitely a sipper. Compared to the non-Eisbock, Id say that it tastes even better, but its a trade-off for the increased alcohol content, which I found a bit difficult to deal with. In my opinion the high alcohol and resultant flavours really detracted from this beer but I still highly recommended it if you have the time to enjoy this very fine beer.","AUSTRALIA","sajuuk"

Christmas pudding of a beer, plums, rich fruitcake, a faint hint of cigars and smoking jackets. The sort of beer to have by a roaring fire on a winters evening while the wife prepares a supper of home made soup with crusty brown bread.

The flavor explodes with dark fruit and molasses. Raisins and figs are most prominent. These transition into wood and pipe tobacco finishing out with a touch of coffee. Alcohol is present as can be expected with a beer of this strength, but is never overpowering. Mouthfeel is full and quite thick, almost syrupy.

Aroma is complex - soft banana and cloves, vinous, dark fruits, alcohol soaked raisins, some bubblegum, light spices, some acetone solvent, complex yeast esters, alcohol noticeable, slight sour notes
Taste again is complex - wheat, rich dark fruits, raisins, soft cloves, some spices, fair amount of alcohol heat, some varnish. complex fruity dark malts, yeast esters, can get a bit too varnishy after a while but still a great flavour
Palate - soft carb, full body, very smooth. Finish as main flavour, smooth spicy dark malts with warming alcohol.

Taste: Very sweet with dark dried fruits, chocolate, caramel, wheat and yeast. The bananas are there but low key thank god. Its spicy and a bit peppery.

Mouthfeel; is big body with soft pointy carbonation and a bit syrupy texture.

Summary: After a long day of work(its 10pm), I figured I need a beer and pulled this German one. Little did I know it is 12%(never knew german beers went this high in alcohol), a style Ive never had (Eisbock)..or the top rated of that style.

Much later, a blanket of crowded tiny bubbles still remained, which amazed me considering the very thick body of this beer. If you dislike doppelbock or weizenbock, youll hate this because freeze-distillation removes the water, hence amplifying the aromas and flavors left behind. I for one loved it. Reminiscent of the finest Trappist quadrupels, brown bread, and every type of cooked sugar youve ever tasted: toffee, chocolate, coffee with sugar and cream, caramelized brown sugar, molasses, boiled down maple sugar, candied nuts. There must be some bitterness balancing this beer, because otherwise it would be cloyingly malty-sweet, but very little flavor or aroma hops stand out. You can certainly smell alcohol, but its smooth like quality aged bourbon. Its not until the warmth hits your blood stream that you realize this thing is 12% ABV.

Appearance: Pours a dark nutty brown color with ruby highlights and a 1/2 finger bubbly very light tan head. Very little lacing, but thats to be expected at 12% ABV.

4463,"2011-09-30",3.6,"Im not a huge fan of the concept of ice beers, but this is not bad at all. It reeks of alcohol, banana, dark fruits, tons of spices and, well, just all the usual wheat notes but very concentrated, which mixed with the alcohol gives an overripe impression. Obviously when poured it doesnt let as much light through as a its non-iced-out sibling does, which makes it marginally less attractivestill a beautiful beer nonetheless. The taste is very sweet and very sournot my cup of tea, quite frankly, because it is too strong and dominated by alcohol. The mouthfeel is mainly syrupy and alcoholic, with some carbonation. The wheat is there, but it isnt the main attraction. It may sound as if I didnt like this beer, but I actually thought it was really goodbut Id much rather have a regular Aventinus.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

4463,"2011-09-18",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 24, 2011 ""Eisbock"" is a term that can refer to either a specific style of very strong lager or a brewing technique. According to RateBeer.com the eisbock style is defined as ""A stronger version of Doppelbock. Deep copper to black. Very alcoholic. Typically brewed by freezing a doppelbock and removing resulting ice to increase alcohol content."" So when a brewery uses the term ""Eisbock"" in the name of the beer its easy to assume its a lager. But in the case of Schneider Aventinus Weizen Eisbock it refers to the brewing technique of freezing the beer - as this beer is simply Schneider Aventinus Weizenbock (a strong wheat beer) that was frozen to increase the alcohol percentage even further. The result is a very complex and tasty beer - I cant wait to try the non-frozen version!I poured an 11.2oz bottle into a snifter (dated 2009)Appearance: Very barleywine-like with a deep purple or maroon color; totally opaque; forms a small, yellow sudsy head which dissipates quickly and completely.Smell: Like spiked fruit punch - a mélange of various fruits with noticeable alcohol presence. Very sweet-smelling - nothing acidic or tart to the nose.Taste: I wasnt sure what to expect with Schneider Aventinus Weizen Eisbock as Ive never had the regular Weizenbock that this brew is derived from. The palate here was definitely in two distinct stages: up front is a remarkably sweet taste of fruit punch and jam, plus red grape, raspberry, and Macintosh apple. It has the sweetness of a complex barleywine or a Belgian quadruple, but a much thinner, lighter body - nothing sticky or syrupy here. The second half changes on a dime and reveals the booziness of the beer. Rubbing alcohol dryness, taste, and heat emerge as does significant carbonation and fizziness. As it warms, the two halves merge together. Its still sweet and fruity but with a bitter, slightly tart and acidic overtone. Whats interesting is that for a wheat-based beer theres nothing wheaty here at all (although I have friends who tried a fresh bottle who say theres lots of banana and clove in the palate). Mouthfeel: For such a big beer its amazing its noticeably thin and highly carbonated - even after warming up and calming down. Surprisingly clean aftertaste - no residual sweetness or dryness.Drinkability: Weighing in at 12% ABV, Schneider Aventinus Weizen Eisbock is no session beer, obviously. The best way to describe it would be ""fizzy barleywine."" It has the complex, rich, sweet flavors found in those bigger ales, but with the lighter, thinner and fizzy mouthfeel and drinkability of a lager (even though its an ale). It can be drank quickly or slowly without much affect on the palate or loss of drinkability. A great beer to pair with any kind of berry cheesecake.Overall, this is a very unique and fun beer to drink, although I dont think Id want to drink it all the time. Its definitely a beer for special occasions.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Looks like a weizenbock on steroids and anti-schizophrenia pills, almost aping a porter, save the tan line at the bottom of the glass.  And, surprise, surprise, it tastes like a weizenbocks gymrat older brother.  You get the banana-n-cloves flavor, but a darker, meatier version, like brandied banana-cloves in a bowl of grain alcohol, like someone bottled up the fire in you parents bedroom on Christmas Eve when you were nine;  its comforting and laced with expectant anxiety.  To be savored slowly, for sure.  Bonus points for anyone who considers this lawnmower beer.   (12/4/08)","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

I have been cellaring this for a little while on my own, I cant tell if its a vintage but I dont believe it is, Ive finally unleashed it since I received the Aventinus Eisbock glass.

Upon first look into bottle all you see is black, that is about to change, so I pop it open.

After pouring it into the official glass with a 2 finger tan head that dissipates quickly it is very dark but has a brownish reddish hue in the thinner parts of the glass and along the sides that makes for viewing wonder. The yeast continuously funnels its way to the top, this thing wont stop bubbling. The yeast itself is a wonder with this beer. Im not sure if this particular glass shape lends itself to the active yeast but it is a great looking and feeling glass to drink out of and I highly recommend getting one to try this beer with.

Massive amount of scents here, Ive got some herbalness, fruitiness, and even some sourness in the nose. Soft clove and raisin are the main scent hits.

First taste. Woooow, creamy, smooth, with enough bite from the yeast, heaps of flavors begin to spill out, coffee, chocolate, raisin, clove, honey, the yeast adds a bit of tartness and the aftertaste is of ripe fruit. This is a malty beer through and through and is like a total bier dessert. As it warms the yeast mellows out and the full flavor effect is reached. The last drop (gulp) was insanely yeast infested and was like the grand finale, maybe not the best part, but a taste experience nonetheless. And Im not even tasting the alcohol in here one bit. This beer is highly drinkable despite its array of potent flavors, but it is best enjoyed with smaller sips.

This beer went great with chocolate truffles, dark cherries and to a lesser extent Assiago cheese.

Overall this is one of my favorites, full bodied, full flavored, and full strength. It is well worth the money and then some.

Utóíze gyógyfüves, fűszeres, keserédes, kissé fanyar és nagyon hosszan kitart. Kint szakad a hó, vadul fúj a szél, én bent ülök a szobában, Fourplayt hallgatok és kortyolgatom ezt a fantasztikus sört. Csak nyugodt körülmények között, kellő odafigyeléssel szabad inni ezt a csodát, minden egyes kortya élmény!","Budapest, HUNGARY","ogreface"

Taste is pretty much exactly the same, with some intensely warming alcohol flavors and a sweet, nougat/cherry-like maltiness hanging around. Strange, but not bad.

4463,"2010-09-07",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 8, 2010 Been after this for a while and never seen it anywhere- including Munich, and where does it turn up? Thats right- Coventry. Coventry is awash with Schneider Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock right now. Well, the posh bit around the Earlsdon Rd, anyway. Just dont buy it from the place that used to be Threshers, its a quid cheaper down the road at Alexander Wines- big money on my beer budget. Pours muddily opaque; bitty like black filter coffee with a deep, persisting cappuccino head. Aroma plummy and spiced like Belgium with pronounced clove, mushy banana, Swedish biscuit and bubblegum notes- all that, and then some; loafy malts like rye bread dunked in beef gravy, a waft of acetone once the heads gone. Immediate buzz and glow, huge Belgian-style mouldering apple peel spiciness, thick swirling clods of clovey yeast, Marmite liqueur, banana confectionary. Slides down easy, but the heat lets you know its there. More than anything this reminds me of a huge, dangerous Belgian that smiles benignly but just might take your head off at any moment (De Dolle?), swimming with chunks of...well, who knows what?- a magical feat of brewing considering its just water, hops,malt, yeast.....and magic.

The flavour is moderately-intensely sweet throughout with a significant alcoholic component. This is balanced with moderately bitter herbal hops. The finish is long and alcoholic, with some hop bitterness. On the palate, it is full in body with a smooth, creamy texture and somewhat vigorous carbonation.

Off-white, huge, long lasting, huge, decent lacing, huge and still there after several minutes. I guess I could say, creamy, foamy and huge. Darker coloured, on the Indian red, brown and beige side with yeast sediments on the bottom and cloudy. Very pleasant aroma of a witbier and weizen.

Comment:
Wow! A very thick, intense, complex and high alcoholic wheat beer. I tried a Franzizkaner on the side and it tasted like water in comparison. It had allot of bananas but not only foam bananas, also some fresh bananas.

I usually prefer my wheat beers during hot summer days but this beer feels to strong for that. It might work well with certain cheeses, but I also believe this could work as an aperitif, possible coupled with a dessert. Unfortunately I didnt have any sweets to try it with at the time.

4463,"2010-02-07",4.0,"330ml bottle. Cloudy brown colour, beige head. Aroma is twisted: banana with some earth, licorice and flowers.

This is an extremely potent beer, you are hit with alcohol up front. Thick, very very full bodied, very spicy, with a yeasty aftertaste. The alcohol covers up the subtle flavours which make the standard Aventinus great, although it is very nice to have the warmth of 12% alcohol on a cold Canadian winter night.

 2008 Bottle, #16648


Aroma: Lots of dried fruits, some dark malts, caramel, booze, and some sugary sweetness.

Appearance: This one pours a murky, dark brownish-orange color with a minimal (light brown) head.

Flavor: Taste is quite sweet, somewhat complex in flavor, some spice, wheat, and some fruit.

Palate: This one has a pretty full body, the booze are there, particularly in the finish.

Overall Impression: 
This beer is pretty interesting.  Certainly a sipper.  The booze is certainly present, and you can feel it, but I dont think it takes away from the beer at all.  There is a lot of stuff going on with this beer, quite complex.  I like it, but it isnt something I would want to drink all the time.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Long-lived aftertaste of jam-like tartness. Vinous to the palate. Detectable alcohol, but not annoying.

The nose is of sugary dark fruits... plums, prunes, raisins, a touch of vinous notes, with a hint of licorice and worn leather.  Flavors contain similar dark fruit esters, with rich sweet (dark) malts, bananas, a touch of clove, an alcohol burn, and a heavier raisin/dried prune finish.  The mouthfeel is syrupy, with a heavy, full body.  The alcohol heat is noted and appreciated for integration into the huge amount of complexities in the flavor palate.

Aroma was earthy and sweet... mixed with booze. I thought the strongest flavors in this beer were olives and licorice... which was unique. However, I also thought it was very watery and too sweet... and had no body or depth. I could smell the alcohol but it tasted more like watered down booze.

This one pours a darkly shaded, golden brown color. Almost a fingers worth of dark tan colored foam forms the head. It recedes to a thin, spotty, surface covering. The lacing is spotty as well and fairly slick.

Theres no denying that this one has a good amount of booziness to it. At 12.00%abv though, its no real surprise. Its loaded with dark fruits, especially cherries. There is a delicious yeastiness, combined with a good deal of wheat, that smells like pie crust. This is the nose of a maltbomb, as far as the sweetness presence goes.
Somewhat like Id expect a pie made from maraschino cherries and rum to smell like.
This is one of the best smells that I know of, for a malt forward brew. Deliciously enticing.

Everything from the nose is still here. Its now joined by a wonderful gingerbread presence though, which is beautiful. It has a nice level of spiciness. The high abv, while not entirely hidden, is not nearly as noticeable as the nose prepared you for. It has a nice warmth going down, but not the heat that was expected.

Full-bodied, getting close to thick. It has a medium-to-high level of carbonation, which gives it just a touch of roughness that works against the creaminess that it has. Just slightly shy of perfection.

The high abv is hidden well enough and this one tastes very nice, if you dont mind the sweet/maltbomb side of the spectrum. I could drink several of these at one sitting, and I have several times. This is one of my go-to beers.
Its recommended, if youve never had it. It could become your new dessert beer, if nothing else.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","coldmeat23"

Aroma is sweet, a bit boozy, with maybe a little clove. On the palate, theres a little small bit of fizziness, definitely not fully carbonated, though. Fairly thick, could use some carbonation to lighten things up. Flavors definitely boozy, with raisins, plums, other fruits beneath. Cant really find any of the banana/clove esters youd expect from a weizenbock - Im sure the age has something to do with that. Definitely a malt bomb by this point, which should be expected after freeze-distilling and 4 years. Probably better fresh or with 1-2 years on it. Also carbonation would be nice.

My first eisbock. I was expecting something much more syrupy, but was surprised. I had the normal Aventinus not long ago, and this is not to far from it.
Myddy brown with high beige head. I am a little surprised by that, becaus I thought high ABV would kill the head. but not in this case.
Nice nose with lots of fruits and malt - banana is there but so is the alcohol. I coud live with half the ABV.

Quite simply this beer is horribly unbalanced. On the palate the alcohol shows through at all times, like an ugly wino in your doorway. This leads to an unpleasant & hot sensation that unless its ice cold, renders the beer undrinkable for me.  Granted the nose is to die for, full malt, caramel & banana syrup, & these flavours do show up in the beer, but are constantly beaten with the hammer of that alcohol.  Its not that great beers cannot cope with 12%abv, this is just not one of them.","milton, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","bacchanalia"

4463,"2009-07-04",3.4,"12 oz bottle into snifter.  Very dark yet clear (if held to the light) reddish purple with a weird off-white/khaki tan head that fizzes like a soda and fades very rapidly to absolutely nothing -- no ring, no film, no-thing.  The aroma is very sweet.  I am not one for sweet beers traditionally, but this stuff smells great.  Belgian candi sugar, sweet dark fruits (red grapes, plums, cherries, etc), a but of tobacco, sherry,sweet malt, and more.  The flavor is, in its essence, good, but this one is just a bit over the top for me. Nice sweet fruity cherry and Belgian candy character, which is offset by the very hot alcohol burn.  The roastiness/tobacco malt quality doesnt seem to mesh very will with the sweet fruitiness, but is unmistakably these nonetheless. Alcohol is NOT hidden well. A bit musty on the finish. Medium bodied with minimal carbonation.  Overall: this is one of the more intriguing beers I have ever had.  It has so much potential -- started off really well and just sort of fell apart in the flavor.  Not horrible by any means, but much more enticing smell than flavor.  This could be awesome if it were only 8% instead of 12 --> too much ""eis""ing, but interesting nonetheless.","@, CAMBODIA","502Che"

Taste/Mouth feel: Its flavor like its aroma is big and deep as well. Concentrated sweet malty flavor is full warming alcohol, mild clove and fruity yeast showing raison, banana peel, prune and bubble gum like flavor notes. The texture was slick and smooth with slightly syrupy, but not overly so, mouth feel. Carbonation is light in this big full bodied beer.

4463,"2009-04-07",4.1,"appearance is wonderful nearly opaque rich red hue with a perfectly floating consistent head that wiggles like scum riding on a fresh batch of simmering chicken stock. nose has the MO to some extent of a good dubbel: raisins, pit fruits and prunes, all with a good dose of caramelization and a wave of booze riding behind them. even as head recedes, carbonation continues to pop. plenty of yeast chunks and other chunks of unknown origin dance through out the bottom of my chalice.  flavor continues to parallel my favorite belgian dubbels, rich flavors that threaten to delve into red wine territory. earthy and rich, and quite substantial. booze is present but not at all offensive, simply warming in the most basic way and not intrusive on the many complex notes in the flavor. amongst it all, it maintains the trademarked weizen mouthfeel: soft and coating. it is possibly the most interesting element to this very intreguing beer, a straightforward sharp mouthfeel would possibly constitute a strike against it and would make the big ABV more noticeable. as it stands this is possibly the grandfather of all big beers. wildly complex and worthy of discussion for long spells.","River Grove, Illinois, USA","satan165"

Very pleasant and full aroma, fresh bananas and cream, clove, toffee wheat bread, cinnamon spice, and only minor alcohol with a big whiff.  Nice pour as well, thick, large bubbled cream head, a very nice layer of retention, opaque but not overly thick looking, and dark honey brown in color.  The first thing noted upon drinking is how smooth and creamy tasting this beer is for the abv.  Theres definitely a strong bite to it, but nice rich flavors accompany it along the way to not let this negatively impact the experience.  The flavor notes are rather similar to a combo of both a well made weiss and doppelbock with good banana, spices, yeast, and light citrusy hops on the wheat side, and cookie dough and rich toffee/caramel malts on the bock side.  Its interesting to me that these flavors come out quite separately with each sip rather than blended together.  The final product though is a very good quality, and strong German brew.

I am not sure if this beer was meant to be swirled to remove the yeast from the bottom but I did. The yeast haze doesn’t really mix in at first. It leaves a milky caramel colored layer at the top, interesting! Aroma is big on wheat, banana, tart plum wine, tobacco, leather, a little roast and some very sweet caramel. Flavor is very interesting for me I have never had anything quite like this, sort of like a wheaty barleywine, wheatwine anyone? Starts off big on wheat malts, sweet and chewy, then some clove spice, slightly tart cherries, banana bread, caramel, chocolate, a decent amount of toast, dried plums, a touch of leather, dried leaf mustiness, and some sweet overripe citrus notes. Finish is overripe bananas, yeast spice, crusty tart cherry pie, plenty of fruity esters. I will say that although I really like this beer there is a not so great metallic aftertaste. Body is warm, thick, sweet and slick, but leads to a dry astringent finish. This is a very nice, complex beer.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

4463,"2008-12-22",3.7,"The initial reaction to this was, well they should not have frozen perfectly good beer. I did warm up to it however. This pours a very dark hazy brown, with a head uncharacteristic of a weizen style, a little tight, not particularly fluffy, something more commonly seen on a stout or bock. This smells sweet with caramel and alcohol notes, I swear I smell just the faintest sour notes as well. There is plenty of flavor, the initial flavor was a big smack in the face with chocolate cherries and alcohol... mostly the latter. This does balance out after a few drinks and shows some delightful roastedness, and some fruity flavors of cherry and banana that sing over the spicy notes of this strong beer.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

Banana and hoppy aroma. Massive kick of hops in the mouth, and a fair burn of alcohol. A touch rough, but not that objectionable - it certainly warms on you. Warms in you too. I am hoping this will soften a bit with age, as the alcohol is too prominent currently. The malts and yeast need to turn fruitier and port-winey. (6:4:7:3:12=3.2)

4 Deep red, fizzy brief head.
7 Rich sweet body, a little oxidized and dusty, maybe just going past its best. Some apple retronasals, but not soured at all which was something I feared might be associated with the sharpness of the aroma.
3 Very sweet body, but fizzy carbonation. Sweet aged malts, a little tired. Hops a little dusty, and no biting bitterness any more.

4463,"2008-11-20",4.4,"Long before I jumped into the bottomless ocean of craft beers, I was already working on being well-immersed in the import beer scene. Well, as much as a novice beer geek can be. I cant count the number of times in the papoose stages of my beer development that I would buy a beer blind, take it home, drink it, and try to understand it along with also enjoying it. Usually I enjoyed it no matter what, but the understanding part was a hit or miss. Thankfully, the internet, beer books, and fellow beer geeks are a plethora of information and insight which has helped me over the years create my own information and insight, validly of course. This brings me to the Schneider-Sohn Aventinus Weizen Eisbock, yet another journey into German wheat beers of which I had no inklings about when I first drank it. Oh, how the times have changed.

A small yet steady stream of bubbles rushes to the top, bursting forth amidst drifts of puffy foam. I close my eyes as I raise my glass to my nose and get lost in a festival of sweet dark cherries, brandy, dry raisins, prunes, dates, and soft floral notes. Accepting her invitation, I enjoy my first quaff and am struck immediately by soft and bubbly effervescence which helps balance the also immediate alcohol warmth, rich dark fruit, and burnt sugar notes. A sweet afterimage of licorice, prunes, and brandy keeps my palate warm and wanting more. Is that some milk chocolate I see, dancing with some fresh vanilla bean? Divine intervention is this, and as I savor my glass, a magical wave of warmth slowly envelopes my body.

Bottle. Dark brown color, almost opaque, with a big beige head that diminishes slowly. Aroma is interesting, bursting with both wheaty fruity esters (banana, hints of apples) and caramelly malt, as well as some alcohol. Sweet flavor with wheat, fruits, some spices, light phenolic bubblegum hints, dark bread, malt, some caramel and an alcoholic taste thats getting stronger towards the finish. Medium to full-bodied and a fluffy mouthfeel with strong carbonation. As the beer warms up its malty character gets a bit more prominent, the wheaty side gets slightly quieter, the strong carbonation settles down a bit, and the alcohol manages to mingle with the other flavors better, making the beer more balanced both in flavor and mouthfeel. My initial score for this beer was 3.5 as it was a bit too messy and theres was a bit too much alcohol for my liking, but now as it got warmer I changed it to 3.8.

Smells like I would expect from a bock up front with some wheat smells afterwards. Raisiny, malty, a little bit of wheat, and a hint of alcohol coming up the rear. Tastes absolutely phenomenal. A smooth mellowed out caramel, malty taste with a hint of the wheat but very little alcohol. The alcohol really sneaks up on you in this one since it comes in at 12%.

4463,"2008-06-24",3.5,"My first experience with an Eisbock.  Beer is a cloudy amber color, and given time some sediment collects in the bottom of the glass.  It produced a nice 2-finger head and lacing was apparent as I drank it.   Initially, right out of the fridge, the smell is all fruit.  As it warms you begin to pick up the alcohol in the aroma.  The front of the tongue gets a nice fruity-sweet taste, but the back of the tongue gets an aftertaste that is almost all alcohol.  You also get a slight alcohol burn as it goes down, but that is slighter than you might expect given the ABV.   Overall, I found this a pleasant beer to drink, but doubt I would ever drink more than one in an evening.

Nose is banana, ripe dark pit fruits, dark berries, toffee and caramel, slight alcohol presence.  Taste is more subdued, more balanced though at the expense of distinctive flavors:  licorice as well as clove spiciness, generic dark fruitiness, caramel sweetness, banana esters fade to just a slight trace. Very little alcohol either up front or at the finish; finish is fleeting, aftertaste is subtle caramel and toffee malt notes.

4463,"2008-03-28",4.1,"2002 Vintage.  Bottle No. 12970.  330 ml bottle very, very, generously given to me by Indra.  Pour is almost clear deep burgundy with a surprisingly big, 1 1/2 inch tan head.  I was amazed that a six year old beer still looked this alive.  The head fell quickly.  Aroma of dense, sweet, cooking cane sugar along with melting caramel.  Also some floral notes, and a round maltiness.  Taste is big sweetness, again more of the slightly cooked cane sugar.  The maltiness translates to an almost English Barley Wine style biscuit maltiness.  A touch of oxidation appears in the after taste, though it detracts in no way from the overall taste of this one.  The alcohol really never was present - age apparently helps a lot on this front.  The palate was big and sturdy holding all of the big flavors in this nicely.  As this warmed (initial temp was about 55) it took on a Tawny Port character which was quite pleasant.  I really enjoyed this one, thanks a million Eric!","Kansas, USA","theisti"

Pretty much on the money. Masses of cola, dark treacle, burnt sugar, bitter cooked fruits on the nose. Aggressive, powerful, has good penetration.

It is worthy of parades, songs, statues, medals, fan clubs, legends, etc.  Alas, I did take it down a few notches, since subsequent tastings have not been as impressive.

The aroma of the beer was made up of banana, caramel, clove, and also some sweet, dark fruits.  The flavor included toasted caramel, dark fruit, wheat, banana, and bubblegum.  Not much of the 12% ABV was detected.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied with a fairly high level of aggressive carbonation.  A really flavorful beer that could be quite dangerous with the well hidden alcohol.  Very good.","Griffith, Indiana, USA","MoDog"

Strong, heavy beer, as an Eisbock is supposed to be. Pours a dark, cloudy, thick stream with a nice head that would probably have ended up nicely if I had tried to make it good in a proper glass (using a pilsener glass unfortunately). Head is white; lacing is reasonable but not as thick as it should be for a beer this strength, in my opinion. Alcohol is noticeable, but only to an aficionado of strong -bocks; makes itself known through the palate. Spicy citrus notes similar to a Belgian witbier are to be expected. Initial sweet flavour becomes increasingly salty as time goes by; finish is very long and astringent at first.","Dundas, Ontario, CANADA","Canuckistani"

Appearance: Pours a deep, dark, and murky brown, almost black actually, with a large beige head, that almost has a purple tint to it. Its so dark and murky I cant even make out a definitive over-all colour when I hold it up to some light. Aroma: lots of yeast, fruity esters, hints of the alcohol, sweet hints of malt complexities, fairly powerful smelling actually. NOTE: The aroma actually does eventually start to spread throughout the room! Taste: POWERFUL! In a good way of course. The yeast hits first, setting the stage for the sweet fruity aspects, which gives way for alcohol, then a very loooooong sweet, malty, complex finish. I swear my tongue almost vibrated during the finish with the sweet flavours rolling up and down it. You can definitely tell this is a 12% ABV brew, yet the alcohol isnt cloying, it just calmly makes itself known. The mouth-feel is probably fuller than any other beer Ive ever had! Its so complex Im tasting totally new things while just sitting here and thinking about it. Actually every sip I take seems to be something new, but there seems to be an underlying theme of fruits, not necessarily just dark ones like prunes, but also vague hints of peach, grapes and cherries? Wow. Another theme seems to be the bubble-gum sweetness flavour that I really liked in the normal Aventius. The thickness and sweetness almost makes me think of maple syrup, with some musky woodiness added. WOW. I can not stress enough how impressed I am. The more whiffs you take, the more you can smell, and the more you let it sit and warm, the more complex and tasty it gets.

4463,"2007-12-07",4.3,"Must be approached almost like a Belgian. Unlike Trappist ales, the Eis-Weizenbock does not rely on the addition of spices, sugars or non-malt adjunct grains. It is all in the yeast and craftsmanship. 

It has all the strength, warmth, fullness of aroma, and persistence of flavour as Chimay Bleue and perhaps even seemed better in some aspects - more rounded-out fuller and smoother in the way Achel Extra is. 

Its all different though - It still has the signature lightly acidic tang of good cleanly-brewed German wheat beers, making it very original. I wish the German Monastic breweries would get in on making this style! 

The aroma from the empty glass stays in the room for a long time. It is great warm or chilled, and so could be enjoyed much in the way people drink dessert wines such as Muscat, Tokaji, Sauternes or Eiswein at many times the cost.

The body is an odd murky brown colour with a tinge of burgundy, and it sits under a constantly replenished off-white head. The flavour was very intense and fruity, with a huge warming finish. The alcohol seems reasonably well-integrated into the drink, but nonetheless hits pretty early. Thick, almost syrupy, mouth feel, with aggressive carbonation exploding flavour on the taste buds.

Flavor strong with the same sweet fruity flavors but balanced out by minor toffee and bread on my palate.  Excellent beer overall for a style that doesnt get much love.  Fabulous beer for a cold winter day.  The higher alcohol content warms you from within, just like a glass of brandy (only this is more fun to drink!).","Lexington, Massachusetts, USA","mvcramer"

A dark murky brown, plenty of sediment. Scent of canned prunes, sweet with a hint of teriyaki sauce.
Sweet flavor, loads of candied fruit, like youd find in a fruitcake, in fact with the slight grainy taste and the warming alcohol, this is quite similar to fruitcake.
I do like my beers big & thick and this is certainly both of those but I do like the ""original"" better.","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"

4463,"2007-09-18",4.0,"Pours a dark, translucent, chocolate brown with only a tiny island of bubbles dancing in the center of the snifter and fading to nothing. A swirl of the glass, however, brings a new, thin, tan head back to life with oily trails streaking the glass. A wheat beer with legs... now Ive seen everything.  The nose is a high-octane version of Aventinus, with notes of plum, raisin, bubble gum, cloves, milk chocolate and a solid hit of alcohol. The chocolate hiding in the background, along with the dark fruit aromas makes me think of the Nestlé Chunky Bars we used to get as kids. This candy bar, however,  is submerged in a smile-inducing barley wine aroma. Fairly full-bodied, especially for a wheat, the mouthfeel is a bit ""gritty"" on the tongue with thousands of tiny bubbles dancing a two-step across your taste buds, scrubbing the moisture from your mouth and concluding just slightly boozy. As the label and commercial description both describe, this beer is the already remarkable Aventinus reduced to its intense essence. This is the espresso to your French roast. Deep, dark fruits, bubble gum without its light sweetness, milk chocolate, faint cloves and a peppery alcohol round out the flavor profile. While, overall,  I prefer the original Weizen Bock to this brew, sometimes youre in the mood for an espresso. When that mood strikes, this would be the one to reach for to satisfy that craving.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

4463,"2007-09-13",3.9,"The Scneider Aventinus is a really interesting beer with a weird, murky, gravy color. It seems like a really thick and yeasty dunkelweizen, but still has a malty bock taste. The alcohol makes itself well known, and other tastes range from fruity to nutty to sour. And, something even struck me as slightly minty.

I was surprised at just how much this beer resembles the regular Aventinus.  It is virtually the same in all respects, except more concentrated.  I picked up vinous fruit on the nose, along with dark malts and wheat.  The flavor is exceedingly sweet, with dark malts, red table wine, and concentrated sour red fruits.  The body is sticky and slightly cloying, with a short, sour finish.  Not a huge fan of the style, but this is a nicely crafted brew.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Dark chocolate, light licorice and prune/raisins.  Rummy sweetness.  As it warms the peppery alcohol really comes through and starts to detract from the other great fruity/spicy characteristics.

Taste is all Aventinus up front, but then feels heavier and more alcoholic on its way down.  Almost warmer.  I probably should have prefaced this review by saying that regular Aventinus is one of my favourite beers of all time, so I was practically giddy about trying this one.

Dark fruits and alcohol come to mind when smelling this beer. The beer looks like a dark, dark caramel brown. In fact, the beer deos seem to have a raisin color to it. The head quickly fades away. The alcohol is very noticeable. I get that alcohol burn at the back of my throat. WHOA this is warming me up. Hints of fruit; plums, raisins, grapes in the taste that quickly disappear due to the ABV. The beer is nice and smooth, and not excessively carbonated.

Dark roasted malt, strong raisin flavour into strong sweetness with a solid alcohol base beneath. Slight clove spiced from the middle towards the finish.

4463,"2007-06-30",4.2,"Bottle (2005, number 10254.  with kind of a spooky looking purple label.)  Pour is a little fizzy... sounds kind of like a cola going into the glass.  Color is a solid, dark brown, and there is no head to speak of.  Aromas are sweet... dark fruit (prunes), molasses and a touch of spicing that strikes me as dark cloves, but Im not sure that pins it down very well.  Mouthfeel is thick and sweet and very enjoyable.  Warmth from alcohol is present from the start and really picks up at the end.  This is just darn fine... and it doesnt hurt that I picked it up in St. Louis for $2.59 a bottle...

4463,"2007-06-25",4.5,"(Picked this up while on vacation in Seattle, WA). Up until about six weeks ago I never knew this existed! Aventinus is one of my favorite beers. I just have to buy it every once in awhile. On top of that I have a strange fascination for EKU28. What could be more interesting than a combination style of both together?!?! Pours VERY cloudy dark beer, the color of dark cola. ZERO head with it. Aroma is much more muted than the ""regular strength"" Aventinus though the yeasty aroma is there if you swirl your glass to concentrate. Wonderful!!. Surprisingly light body compared to other eisbocks Ive had, but warming alcohol flavor comes out in the end fairly rapidly. Very clean palate. A minute, or two, after drinking you dont have anything lingering on your tongue except the previously mentioned warming. Not something Id be drinking all the time at $6/bottle, but definately something Id enjoy having as a sipping beer every once in a while. Definately a much more palatable beer than either EKU28 or Samiclaus Enjjoy it if you can get it!!! (Anyone know of a source here in the SF Bay Area?)","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"

Medium bodied, with carbonation creating the impression of an even more full-bodied beer.  Flavor combines sweet malt, modest bitterness and sourness in a robust yet balanced and complex manner.

It is not too over powering considering how strong it is and that it is practically flat (maybe only my bottle?). Caramel, a bit burnt, a hint of chocolate. Lots of bits and pieces in the bottle.

Alchohol is reasonably well hidden (and not listed on label).

The banana/clove esters of the standard version are nearly absent compared to the forward alcohol.  Bubble gum and tutti fruiti abound.  Feels a bit syupy with some low carbonation, though later sips after harder pours were creamy and smooth.  Perhaps it was the yeast.  A medicinal sweet alcohol reminiscent of a decent sambuca.  Sweetness is cut by alcohol and then some.  Cinnamon, cloves, some allspice.  Banana comes out more toward the end of the bottle (the yeast?).  Some buttery diacetyl well cut/hidden by the alcohol.  The heat is in fact a bit overwhelming.  Some anise in the lingering aftertaste.  Immediately fruity and alcoholic finish.

Enticing and varied aromatics of rich licorice and vanilla; also floral (violets and mock orange) and faintly smoky. English barleywinelike flavors: figgy and raisiny, cola, hints of chocolate, tobacco, and leather. Noticeably, but not unpleasant, tarry character. Peppery and exotic. Obvious ethanol mesmerizes with its complex quality comfortable as flannel, yet as urgently alive as arcing plasma. Rich and buttery palate, almost waxy.

Flavor is thick, full of super-chewy malts, lots of clove, deep roasted caramel, touches of bananna, vanilla bean, cream, sour oranges, toasted figs, with pine nuts and sherry.

There is also some chocolate cherry syrup, alcohol, and strawberries.

4463,"2007-01-31",3.9,"When Colorado was hit with a massive blizzard just a couple days before my flight to Paris, I knew what I had to do: buy some beer. My instinct was correct, for it wasnt until the day after Christmas that I was finally home. Spending those miserable few nights without company was more than I could handle during these pseudofestive times. Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock was attractively robust and showed well in the past sips I had gleaned, so I opted for it. Poured in my trusty chalice, the apparent mahogany glow it exuded was attractive but diminished by a rather mundane white layer, fizzing off rapidly. Shortly, its rich and buoyant aroma silenced my skepticism and gloriously released the avalanche of vanilla, juicy oak and brown sugar that I remembered. Cherry, red apple, maple syrup, balsamic vinegar and strawberry quickly followed suit. A noticeable presence of alcohol delineated this potent concoction following to the palate and burgeoning to a rather unpleasant burn. What transpared from the flavor was a dense and syrupy amalgam of cherry, grape, plum, banana and cotton candy, still shielded by continuous ethanol as if it were seen through stained glass. The opulent tones of vanilla and oak continued to satisfy my thirst and thrust the palate in an attempt to overcome the heat. A fascinating brew, but one I would have enjoyed far more with a slightly less alcoholic mordant.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

An excellent beer, one of my favorites.","Rochester, New York, USA","ElJefe"
4463,"2007-01-27",4.2,"A prominent tart plum and raisin alcohol vapor escaped from the bottle as soon as it was uincapped. Even more of the enticing aroma as the contents were pured, and then finally savored from the glass. 

Looking at it, I have this thick dark brown beer sitting beneath an inch of tan colored foam. As I hold the glass up, i see the beer is a bit murky, and there are lots of yeast floaties (or more accurately - sinkies) in the glass. A thick layer of brown yeast remains at the bottom of the bottle. Some deep ruby highlights to the beer too. The foam fades quickly, leaving behind no trace, not even lacing. Still, some of the thick liquid clings to the sides of the glass as I sip it.

The fruity tastes that I first detected in the aroma are still quite noticeable in the flavor, but not as sharp or clearly defined. I also taste hot alcohol, with a lightly roasted or smoky malt, and some brown sugar. Nice full body a bit light on the carbonation. More alcohol and some sugary malt in the aftertaste.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"

4463,"2007-01-12",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2012 Pours a real cloudy brown.  I tried to pour a good head out of this (into my new Aventinus glass no doubt), but all I got was a soda-like temporary bubbly fizz.  Aroma was pretty strong on this and very nice, with some grapes, booze and wood.  Tastes noticably of caramel and sugar at first, but theres a lot of dark/dried fruit flavor that comes out soon after.  Some more wood, and light vanilla too.  Finishes with some alcohol, and a nutty flavor.  I detect the yeast coming into the finish, but its not drying.  In fact, I found the finish a bit cloying and the aftertaste slightly off.  This beer felt creamy and thick and minimally carbonated, unlike regular Aventinus.  Theres a lot to like about this beer, but I find myself wishing for a different finish.  I usually am fine with cloying in a really syrupy beer, but this is not syrupy, so the finish is out of place.  Not too far off from a barley wine in fact. 


Finally revisted this beer, and man, it was SPOT ON.  It was so good in every respect.  It still tasted like Aventinus, poured a nice big foam like Aventinus, but had that concentrated quality that made the original so interesting.  Nothing bad about the finish or mouthfeel at all!  In fact, the carbonation was still on the high side.  A weizen-barley wine if you will, and I love it.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

There are large peices of sediment, however, they did not discourage me.  Smells of apples, peaches and berries.  It is very smooth on the palatte.

4463,"2007-01-09",4.5,"12 oz. bottle, 2005, #1476.  My first eisbock, and what an experience it was.  Upon first opening it, I caught a whiff of berries followed by red wine and then the cloves Im used to from wheat beers.  Later on the aroma became more like a port, if I recall port correctly.  Simply spectacular from an aroma standpoint.  Poured a real dark amber color, but not much head to be found.  The taste was also port-like, with dark fruits, caramel, and cloves in the mix.  Very slick on the palate and the finish was alcoholic.  What did you expect from something 12% ABV?  It looks like Im in the minority here, but I liked this a bit better than the regular Aventinus.   This seemed a bit more complex aroma and flavor-wise.  The 3 for appearance is mainly because no head formed.  My glassware may be to blame for that, but hopefully there will be a re-rate on this one in the future.

4463,"2006-12-21",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 Weissbierbrauerei G. Schneider & Sohn is a pretty harsh name for any non-German speaker to say without fear of damaging their epiglottis.  But its a misleading experience for anybody drawing on German culture from a bottle of this purple clad Aventinus.  You see, I think its easy to come away with a perception of Germany as heavy foods and harsh words, but when we do we lose a sense of Prussian elegance  a nobility that easily matched the French in culture, sophistry and a sense of noblesse oblige (even if that oblige went back to the noblesse).  Beginning with its wrappings and down to its flavorful core the Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock is a brew redolent with the sense of richness.  A shade of brown like the fertile fields of Flanders sits squarely in the glass with a non-descript head cresting the rim.  Its dark with passivity but patient.  A very forward aroma advances from the glass to preach a blend of rich coffees married with powerful and balanced malts.  Raspberry and chocolate, a natural couple follow closely, offset by copious alcohol and finally attenuated to a peeping wheat and biscuit taste.  All these flavors glide effortlessly on a smooth and full bodied palate like a merlot, mimicking its vineyard county cousin with a touch of muscat thrown in leaving the overall taste dry and high, giving the drinker an uncanny sense of thankfulness for the berry benison.  Aventinus Weizen-Eisbock makes for real suave drinking.  A thick and satisfying palate with equally thick and satisfying flavors promises the drinker a complete and satisfying experience.  As far as German tradition goes, this is yet another combatant in the long war of attrition to dispel the horrible legacy American industries have wrought with their beer for the masses.  And as far as Im concerned it is a noble fight.  All the better, I think, to restore a good name to a good culture of brewing from a refined and rooted Germanic tradition.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Flavor is like moderately sweet banana bread up front, becoming spicier and warmed by the alcohol towards the middle, finishing in a long lingering sweet and spicy finish.  As might be expected this is like a strengthened version of the normal Schneider Aventinus, and so is also excellent but in a different way.

A little beet flavoring as well, probably attributing to the sweetness. Its an adventure getting this one down, however, its not one of my favorite styles (next to Barleywines).

Tastes strongly alcoholic, extremely spicy, with even some coriander and orange peels, before the vinous bock flavors take over, backed by brown sugar.

It is highly carbonated with the yeast that poured into the glass riding the bubbles up and then falling down from the top.

Oh, man!  What an aroma.  Fruity, bready, begs you to drink it.  Even though this is 12% ABV you sure cant smell it.

The taste is of bananas, plums, sweet caramel and with undertones that hint at the 12%.  (You cant hide 12% forever.)  This is one of the best things that has ever entered my mouth.

Has a very thick and full mouthfeel and you can certainly tell its got the alcohol in there, but i would have to say that for a 12% it is suprisingly balanced. The large amount of alcohol is balanced by a fruitly malty sweetness that is quite strong. Has dark fruit flavors like raisins. A very slow sipper.

This beers presence is rather muggy (hot & sticky) with rich malts, thick cherry juice and crisp spicing.

Cloudy dark brown with little black flecks.  Clove which changed to banana aroma as the beer warmed, mingling nicely with potent pumpernickel malt, reminiscent of the 2001 Two Brothers Weiss Wine.

The nose on this beer is jam packed with big chocolate, carmel, and sweet malt aromas coupled with that signature funky, yeasty aroma of Aventinus, and alcoholic strength. The palate is very rich and complex with intense malt flavors. Big flavors of sweet malt, caramel, chocolate, estery fruit flavors of banana and pear, vanilla, and toffee coat the tongue. The body is fat and lush on the tongue as it slowly glides down the throat. This beer finishes with more big sweet malty flavors up front, then ends with a long, soothing, high octane burn. Aventinus Eisbock is a very potent brew coming in around 11% abv. 

This beer in a word is; stunning. Without a doubt one of the most impressive beers on the market today. This beer is very potent, and is marketed in 11.5 oz bottles, vrs the 1/2 liters you usually get Aventinus in. It is very rare as Beverage United, its importer, only gets 120 cases of this beer per month over the winter, making it a hard to find beer. This beer is perfect this time of year, and is the ultimate beer to sip and savor. Drink this beer alone, enjoy the complex flavors and aromas.

Intense aroma: sweet grape, yeast, alcohol (nose hair burning yet somehow restrained), sweet malt, and some fruit and spice.  Tate:  interesting earthy sweetness and hops up front giving away to thick malt and spice, with a lingering grape fruity finish. Alcohol more prominent in nose than taste, but it is there. Interesting aftertaste as I breathe of I guess tobacco (Ive never tried or really smelled) - it is certainly earthy organic plant like.  Maybe some wood and smoke in the aftertaste as well.  Wow, what a complex sipper with flavour to spare. It looks syrupy but really is carbonated perfectly over a medium to thick mouthfeel.  There is an ice wine like quality to this (having tasted a number of ice wines) so I can see the Eisbock effect on a truly great beer.  I had a hard time describing this one, kind of a stream of conscious rating, but the bottom line is that I thoroughly enjoyed just about if not the same as the regular Aventinus.

4463,"2005-12-10",3.9,"11.2z bottle #059329.  Dark brown and murky.  Beer appears to lighten around the edges.  Minimal tan head.  Nose is nothing but barnyard.  Starting to get some banana, and cinnamon notes.  Figs and sweet bread.  Syrupy coating sensation.  Thick and heavy and viscous and alcoholic.  Sherry and port notes, but with a sprite or 7up effervescence.  Musty and bready, grainy, raisins, resinous and with a piney hoppy burn in the aftertaste.  Terrific brew.

Aroma is of vanilla and just a ton of dried fruits; raisins, plums and figs. The body is very syrupy sweet with a lot less CO2 than the original. The flavor is heavily sweet and applewine-like with lots of cloves but loses the ripe banana that the original is known for. There is a light chocolate that adds to the beer but the cloying body is hard to down. Not a bad beer at all but I would rather have the orignal although that is my favorite German beer so its kinda hard to beat IMO.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"

4463,"2005-10-16",4.0,"Dark brown with a violently fizzy head that disapppears faster than Glenn McGrath after he reaches the batting crease. The aroma of the fizzing head gave some banana, but that gave way to toffee, plum and raisins, much like some of the Belgian strongs. The alcohol strength brings out so much of the caramelly fruit qualities, its only really in the initial aroma and the aftertaste that I can find the wheat. A great balanced flavour, this just cries out to be drunk as fast as possible. The alcohol is well contained, although with a good whiff you do get an idea of what is coming. It provides substantial warming as it cascades down the throat. Great beer, but more than one could lead to some slurring!!","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","bridge"

Taste is similar to normal Aventinus, phenolics become a bit more intense. The freezing lends port-like qualities, and that of fruit jams.  While an intense beer, this is thinned out considerably by the alcohol. At around 3 years the bottles seem to lose their carbonation.

Dark, reddish-brown hue with almost zero head and a strong torrent of chocolate-cherry liqueur candy, plum, raisins and port in the fragrance, some diesel as well.

Dark reddish brown--not a lovely color--with large particles floating around(now suspended, as if in anti-gravity...very cool effect...although larger particles did settle) and topped by a head the exact color of uncooked rice (I happened to have some sitting out).  Head appears slightly foamy and turns into a ring, no lacing.  Mouth is solidly medium with lots of foamy carbonation, lightly creamy--nice mouth.  Aroma: you can smell the alcohol on this one!  Wow!  Malty with lots of dark fruits, primarily prune and cooked cherries.  Flavor is malt laden and loaded with fruit--plumbs, cherries, prunes, apple skin.  The wheat adds a most interesting flavor, having been aged and frozen.  Clove is surely noticable, but its sugary sweet with a touch of licorice.  Alcohol actually takes a back seat as the beer warms--most unusual--and fruits dominate the aroma (and yeast jumps in with a sweet black bread aroma), with the wheat flavor coming out with the fruits, covering the alcohol.  Sugary sweet, dark fruit finish, lightly bitter and quite dry considering.  Terrifically warming and surprisingly pleasant for a non-full bodied beer boasting 12%.

Big alcohol up front. Smooths into malty wheat and really yeasty. Spicy. Cloves shoine through and banana not as evident. Rich maltiness throughout. Rich malty aftertaste that lingers sticky on the palate. The bit of alcohol burn in this one brings down the drinkability but still a nice beer.

4463,"2005-05-06",3.8,"Tasted, this one the youngest of six(050617), late on a cold Sunday night. Became the perfect relaxant as its subtle, but warming alcohol kicked in and calmed my body like an elixir. Poured it into an Aventinus glass, an off white ring of bubbles did little to raise any head, giving hint to its brandy like qualities. Heavy yeast clumps floated about a very hazy ruby-brown body. Sumptuous, but intense caramelised sugars in the aroma, generously spicy alcohol phenols, yeast and concentrated toffee notes like a sweet pudding dessert. Similar in the mouth as it rounded the gums and sought out the crevices with its mild port and brandy-like flavours. Very smooth and medium big bodied, most of the malty sweet flavours came across as almost concentrated and hard to define. Notes of plums, burnt toffee, molasses and bready yeast, and spicy fruitcake blended uniformly, and followed long into its warming alcohol and sweet malt swallow. Personally, I did not find it as complex as the Weizenbock, but in a completely different field, this is a lovely big-beer and a credit to this brewery.","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"
4463,"2005-05-03",4.7,"Fantastic beer.  Foam pushed right out of the bottle when I took the cap off.  Lively, audibly fizzing for several minutes as the head worked its way down so it was at a reasonable height to resume the tasting.  Modest medium brown in color.  Aroma is pepper, anise, nutmeg, bananas and hazelnut.  Perfectly delicious.  Flavor follows through in like fashion - bananas, cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and pepper complexity.  Malts are superstars - mainly caramel and chocolate.  Smooth body.  Id like it a little creamier and heavier, and it lost some carbonation fairly early on, so thats why Im knocking it down a point for each in the ""palate"" category, and taking one off in its ""overall"" score.

The taste is big and bold, but  the alcohol is much too apparent. This tastes more like a quad/abt, and nothing like any wheat beer that I have ever had. Honestly, the feeling in my mouth is like I just took a shot of whiskey, this thing burns! I am dropping the taste a couple points because of the alcohol burn. The body of the beer is thick, until the alcohol takes over and burns the hell out of my mouth until I cant determine the body and mouthfeel.

There are notes of banana, dried dates, sweet malt, and molasses ... this all underpinned by alcohol. WOW!! The flavor is HUGE but at the same time, very smooth.

It didnt disappoint. Poured a leathery colour with plenty of chunky sedimentation. 3cm fizzy tan head with a little cinnamon-coloured sediment on top. Settled disappointingly quickly with no lace. Very fizzy-looking. Wonderfully rich Aventinus aroma of burnt toffee, cloves, faint wheat and young Australian shiraz (syrah). Thick, syrupy body with sweet raisiny fruit at the front of the mouth, some spice in the middle and an almighty slug of port-like alcohol in the finish that you feel, as much as taste. The only negative IMO is a slight phenolic taint to the finish, probably due to the high abv. The Eisbock is thoroughly admirable but for me, the standard Aventinus is better balanced.

 Poured a dark maple syrup hued body and a fluffy khaki colored head. The aroma was a big malty soup of rapture! Basically all I kept thinking the entire time was this is like a thinner bodied Canadian Maple syrup with alcohol! Flavor is a sweet maltyness, a little smoky, somewhat earthy, with a full nutty backbone. There were also nice suggestions of brown sugar, and a light hint of melted margarine that were sitting beside date sugars, plums, and raisins.

4463,"2004-10-05",3.6,"The reddish brown body was clouded with oodles of yeast.  The initial fizz of carbonation was cola like, and the resulting head did not last.  The latent carbonation was soft and steady.  The aroma was mostly alcohol with some red cherries thrown in the mix.  The wheat based origin of the beer was not quite evident on the nose, as there was nary a hint of banana.  The taste was again quite different than the unfrozen Aventinus, with the front and center flavor being peppery spiciness.  The fruitiness showed up in the form of rum raisins, licorice, and plum. There was some evidence of oxidized character in the form of tobacco juice like bitterness.  The hops only provided an aromatic floral background with minimal bitterness.  This beer is much closer to a Belgian Strong Dark Ale, than a Weizenbock that it started as.  The alcohol is more concentrated than the non frozen version and it does not hide quite as well.

Cant deal with more than a couple of ounces at a time, though.  Same intensity of flavors as a barley wine, sure, but none of the cloying bubble gummy sweetness.  Yeah, raisins and sweet spice like a winter stout, huge mouthfeel, you know the alcohol is there but there is none of the heat or burn of alcohol ... wonderfully masked by the intensity of the malt.  So is it better than an Aventinus?  It sure is not as useful as an Aventinus ... this is sort of ""take half a beer and call me in the morning"" beer, not beer and wurst or beer and pizza beer. // As good as the first sip tastes, this one saturates all too quickly and you cant imagine having another one for months to come.

No head at all even when i tried to tease one out. My first sip left me thinking of a barley wine then that second set of flavors came through and I tasted raisins and spices that were like a sweet stout or Baltic porter. The finish was clean with only lingering sweetness. I couldnt taste a single lick of alcohol which is freaking insane for 11%

The head was apparent for about 12 seconds and thick may i add before it wafted away into fizzy nothingness. The aroma yields definite alcohol but also a pleasant sweetness provided by raisins and plums. I also detect a hint of raspberries and perhaps a tart fruit and doughiness.

Poured out a deep caramel brown color, with reddish highlights. Ruby port color in appearance. Head is non-existent. Barely a fine line of lacing around the edges of my snifter.
Aromas are of alcohol right off the bat. But, upon further inspection, the aromas envelope the nostrils with rich Dutch cocoa notes, background of bananas macerated in brandy, that first cup of latte in the morning, and rich cheesecake. Aromas are somewhat deceiving, because the tastes just dont match up.
Tastes are of rich tawny port, alcohols, and Godiva chocolate truffels. Finished somewhat sweet and malty. It surprized me by how smooth and rich it was.

Seriously, I got a head rush and my stomach started turning around like a shot of whiskey just hit it.    Needless to say I took smaller sips from there on.

I would have to try this one on a cold winters evening, it would probably be spot-on.  But today it is just too overwhelmingly sweet and strong.

So I grabbed this one out of my cellar and threw it into the fridge.  After taking a shower I cracked it open.  Lacking the proper glassware, I was forced to use a small imperial pint glass.  Upon pouring, I appreciated a mild carbonation, a moderately amber color, and no haziness.  I also noted a smaller head that was quickly diminishing.  With regards to aroma I was able to discern a mildly sweet, wheaty aroma.  My palate immediately alerted me to the 11% abv.  After a second opinion my palate noticed that the mouthfeel was fairly thin, vinous.  Furthermore, the overall impression of this beer is a little lacking in complexity.

Aroma is indeed reminiscent of an aventinus in the breay malt profile and gentle spiciness + plummy and banana fruitiness, but the difference lies in the heating factor. The eisbock is quite alcoholic and sweeter. In mouth, wheat chunks are to be found playing around with lovely aventinus flavours, but its very heating which makes it less friendly on a sunny day. Dark ripe fruits and pancake syrup character is quite appealing, but this remains vastly inferior to the regular to me, although I prefer the lower level of carbonation in here.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Big sweetness, hot, fruity to start and changes into an alcohol dryness with powdery chocolate and yeast bite. Creamy, bustling pinpoint carbonation, and dry from the alcohol though still weighty.

Overbearing at this point, needs some age to settle into the malts; spicy phenols exacerbate the problem.

33 cL bottle, goblet.  Deep chocolate, molasses, dark bread malt (H); prune, plum, raisin, port, alcohol, clove and banana aromas.  Theres a brothy aroma component (likely the yeast) that keeps me from scoring this one higher.  Deep brown/purple body with a quickly diminishing soda-like head.  Heavily sweet flavor becomes a heavily sweet, lightly acidic, alcoholic finish.  Heavy body, oily texture, lively carbonation.  The bottom line is: very nicely made...but it reminds me of grape juice for some reason.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

4463,"2004-05-03",3.7,"*alcohol...GASP*  Remarkably murky dark ruby beer with a sizeable fizzy, white head that quickly disappears.  Absolutely obscene amount of yeast chunks.  Nose is banana, raisin, brown sugar, and lots of alcohol.  Flavor is not dissimilar to taste, with banana, dark fruit, and alcohol.  After the initial fruity, malty front, what lingers are the banana and alcohol.  Goes flat a wee bit quickly, but it is mildly rich.  12 oz of this on an empty stomach and Im feeling pretty good right now.  I like this, but the alcohol is just a little too apparent.  I hope to get to try the regular Aventinus weizbock.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sfontain"

4463,"2004-04-26",3.9,"This review may be a little skewed from being sampled after the Whiskey-barrel aged Dogwood Winter, but it's still a good beer. That being said, the original is really better. The head could be better, it was a little weak. The body was a dark, dull brown that was quite cloudy. Tons of overripe banana and overripe apples along with a richness to the malt that's not present in the pre-iced version (the richness is nice, but the yeast-fruit flavors in the regular Aventinus are more refined). You feel the alcohol more than you taste it. It warms the stomach and lightens the head. If you drive to the bar alone, it's perhaps best not to combine this with the Dogwood Winter barrel-aged. Luckily, I had my wife to drive me home.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
4463,"2004-04-22",4.2,"2002 Bottle (#08168) 04.21.04.  First thought: why number the bottles if there are that many?  Pours a dark, swampy auburn brown.  The head is somewhat fizzy but lingering.  Aromas are definitely similar to Aventinus with ample banana, clove, apple cobbler, candied fruits.  Many aromas carry into flavor, as well as butterscotch, toffee.  Very rich mouthfeel compliments the thick, coating flavors highlighted by sparkling carbonation.  Surprisingly, the alcohol is not dominant although it is most certainly present.  It does tend toward cloying sweetness as it warms, but the texture just gets better - like candy that's just too sweet.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

Disappointing.","Boone, North Carolina, USA","Brodie"

The taste is sweet, and the beer has quite a light body despite being concentrated.  The alcohol is found starting in the middle and going through the finish of this beer.  There does not seem to be enough beer here to stand up to the alcohol.  There are some nice notes of clove, a hint of banana, and concentrated fruit (raisin is dominant).  As it warms up a bit the body becomes smoother and creamy, though the astringent alcohol remains in the finish.  Overall this was just a bit disappointing, the ice-concentration left this beer a bit unbalanced, though it is still pretty good.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Aroma is full of fruit notes (plums/brandied pears)musk sticks and alcohol. Has quite a sticky mouthfeel. Flavour is not as complex as the regular Aventinus - sweet malt, plums honey and alcohol. Has a sweet malt finish with evident alcohol burn. The only complaint I have is that the alcohol is a bit too evident but it is a 12% ABV beer. Interesting variation on a classic beer.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","winkle"

Aroma is sweet with strong scents of brown sugar. Pouring this is like cutting open a bag of brown sugar and sticking your face in it. 

The first thing that struck me about the flavor was the taste of brown sugar and honey like candy. The initial flavor is like a smack in the face of sweetness. No bitterness to be found anywhere. No balance, just supersweet cloying sugar, honey, and candy. Definitely smells better than it tastes.

Mouthfeel is sticky and thick, one of my favorite parts actually.

It lacks the big rich malty nose of its true Eisbock brethren. The flavor is a chewy caramel with sweet banana and lots of other sugars. The mouth-feel is syrupy with a soft finish (given the high ABV). The aftertaste is that of lingering wheat, fruit, and caramel. The alcohol is 100% masked in this bad bear.

Very nice and complex nose! The taste starts very sweet and vinous, much like an Eiswine. A good fruity component and a hint of spice appear once you get past the initial flavor attack. The finish displays a mild bitterness and some smoky character. The alcohol is noticeable but does not overpower at all. This medium to full-bodied brew has a lively and astringent mouthfeel, a tad sticky on the lips.

Some major band-aid plastic and vitamin coating phenols flying all around a big ethanol heated alcoholic smack, with hints of some dark fruits and malty sweetness that can be sensed just before the alcohol or after a long time of off the rim sniffing. Taste is very nice and malty sweet with nice subtle complexities. A good load of fruityness both ripe and dried variants that contain some plum, raisin, and dates and there's a wonderful caramel smoothness coming into the finish lingers some; but that start is quite complex in the wheats, malts, and fruits with a pleasant mesh of everything. The midway point has a good little hop bitterness and building point which then lightly soothes out to a nice mellow finish of caramel which is very congenial and has some nice little agreeable plastic yeasty notes that never overwhelm as so does the alcohol which sits behind it all waiting to take charge upon bigger gulps and slightly burn with a spiced alcohol. Feel is pretty thick and chewy, nearly full, smooth for sure with a favorable creamyness and alcoholic edgeyness in its finish.

Slowly overpowered by the nice spicy wheat and bananas/clove aroma.  Alcohol as well.  Opens up with lots of alcohol. Very strong beer.  As it warms and breathes, it becomes quite similar to the weizenbock with more alcohol, and less wheat taste.  Still a bit watery at the finish, but maybe some more chocolate flavors become more easily detectable.  I would be interested to try some cellared eisbock as I would agree the young eisbock is better than their young weizenbock (if you can get past the alcohol).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Some fruity flavors are there with a pear, raisin end to the flavor. Finishes with a nice alcohol sting and warmth feeling.

Nose has a small undertone of fruit and then an assault of strong alcohol, something sharp and not pleasing at all. Thankfully, the nose isn't really associated with the flavor which is actually quite enjoyable. Warm on the way down, malt and fruit are in the aroma. Sticky palate, but isn't too cloying.

The colour of the beer was a nice dark brown colour with a slight purple haze, but that could have been from seeing it on the bottle's label :-). The smell is simliar to Aventius, grapey, malty and even chocolatey. Full-bodied, malty, fruity and definateliy alcholic tasting. The aftertaste is almost purely alcoholic, but not burning or harsh in any way. This is one that is spot on with the commercial description, basically a more intense Aventius, but it works out pretty nicely! I really liked the Aventius in the first place, and I think this was good, but I probably would prefer the original 9 out of 10 times, still.

Artistry is needed to capture the wondrous quality of this beer's appearance--the best that I can recall seeing for a very long time indeed.  Pours a lovely murky chestnut color, and the head is incredible.  It is perhaps the first head that I've seen that actually increases after the pour before settling down (but remaining).  The carbonation in a good glass (I used a Oberdorder Weissbier pilsner glass, don't know if that was a faux pas) consisted of layers of extremely small streams of bubbles, rising oh-so-slowly in the glass.  Elegant and attractive.  The aroma was bold, reminding me of a Belgian double, with raisin, banana, and a hint of clove.  The flavor and palate are affected by a sharp bite of the alcohol--perhaps the most noticeable ""flaw"" here, if that kind of raw alcoholic tingle bothers you.  There is also an attractive creaminess to this provided by the strong malt base, and as it clings to the tongue whiffs of flavor hang around for a long finish.  Oh yes, I enjoyed this beer, despite the faults which may prevent this from being regarded as the cream of the crop.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

Flavors include milk chocolate, vanilla, clove and citrus with even a hint of smoke.  Very smooth and hides its alcohol masterfully well, at least until it reaches my stomach and warms me up.

Side by side the had the same dark ruby-brown appearance, smelled almost identical and tasted virtually the same.  After the Aventinus warmed a bit it started to show its alcohol content in both the nose and on the palate.  Delicious sweet bananna, clove, bubble gum flavors. Medium body, mild carbonation (less carbonation than the Pistol).  I paid around $4 a bottle for this.  A 4 pack of Trois Pistole runs me $7.49 at Kroger.

Aroma is very strong clove, bubble gum, banana, wheat malt, peppery, plummy, and a hint of diacetyl.  Alcohol also appears in aroma as it warms.  Clove and malt flavor also up front with dark fruit and alcohol playing supporting rolls; finishes drier than expected for a very malty beer.  Very well balanced.  Alcohol is very subtle warming and not noticeable in the draft version making this a very dangerously good beer. Higher carbonation lends to lighter than actual body.  Very good beer on a cold winter night, or a hot summer day.  If you are able to have this on tap, I highly recommend it!","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"
4463,"2003-01-17",4.3,"tasted this the other day at the schneider brauhaus. the main difference between this and regular aventinus was simply that this was a sipping beer whereas aventinus can be swigged. full roasted peach and apricot didn´t become nasty as with so many beers of this strength. great stuff","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
4463,"2003-01-15",3.8,"Sampled at the Weisses Brauhaus in Munich, but it really did not matter as the bottles they came with clearly were meant to be exported to the US - hardly a single german word on them :-). 
Aroma is estery and contains strawberries and bananas. Very dark, but the glasses themselves were made to resemble ice, so not much more could be seen.
Strong banana flavors well set in a 
fullbodied yet refreshing  beer - actually scary with a beer of this strength.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","jonas"
4463,"2003-01-12",4.0,"My Minnesotan compatriot, slikwily, gave this brew a perfect score. I too enjoyed it immensely, but am not as generous. The great thing about this Eisbock is that, although very high in alcohol, it doesnt hit you over the head with alcohol taste. Sweet, roasted malt aroma, with pervading alcohol notes. Fine bubble, off-white to light brown, large head; fully lasting. Dark brown in color. Rich, malty taste, with a bite. Very enjoyable in moderation.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"

4463,"2002-12-10",4.8,"Bottle 03420 from 2002.  Well, let me start this review by saying that I was very anxious to try this beer.  I love the original Aventinus but this just blows it out of the water.  The smell alone is better than almost any other beer I have ever had.  Nice, spicy, yeasty, fruity aroma.  The taste is so many more times as complex as the original Aventinus, with sweet malt and so many tiny bubbles.  Gosh, I love the carbonation in this beer because it makes for such an incredibly light and powerful beer.  The beer finishes very warm and very suitable for the 17 degree weather we are experiencing in PA right now.  This beer is an absolute must try and really does deserve a perfect score because I cannot find a single flaw in any aspect of it.  Well worth the somewhat hefty price for a 12oz. bottle.","Pennsylvania, USA","Prostman"
4463,"2002-12-02",3.6,"Im not sure if I should be comparing this to regular Aventinus or not, so I will try not too, even though I want to say it tastes like Aventinus was put on the stove and reduced to a thicker, stronger substance.  Well, I guess that sums it up, and I guess I will compare it to Aventinus.  The main diff. I see (smell) is that it has lost a lot of its wheaty nose - not as much banana and clove.  The malts are predominant on this one - lots of chocolate and plum.  Second place goes to a sly alcohol taste thats nearly hidden but sharply pokes you every once in awile.  This stuffs pretty good.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
4463,"2002-11-30",4.3,"Pours a very cloudy dark brown color with a big tan head that rapidly disappears. The aroma is very sweet and fruity, quite similar to many barley wines I have tried.

Otherwise this is an excellent beer.","Greenville, South Carolina, USA","Uglyradio"

4463,"2002-10-03",4.6,"Ok, Im a sucker for weizenbocks, and Aventinus has always been a guilty pleasure. When I was able to convince a package store in Connecticut to bring in a case, I only passed a few bottles to fellow Aventinus fanatics before taking over half of the case for myself. A nose that is crossed between bananas foster and a great pain perdu and strong vanilla and fruit flavors. The big malt masked the obvious strong alcohol long enough for me to quaff three of these beauties before reminding myself of the dangers of the beers of the family Schneider.","San Francisco, California, USA","scowlzineamg99"

Finish is moderately sweet, moderately bitter, moderately acidic. Full body, creamy texture, fizzy carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Much like standard Aventinus, but some things are better and some worse: the mouthfeel is extremely thick and very creamy/chewy (the consistency of buttermilk), but the aroma and finish suffer a bit from the extra alcohol (more in the aroma than the finish, thanks to the thick body and strong and lasting flavor profile), and its sweeter as well.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
