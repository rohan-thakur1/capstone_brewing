Has a dark brown color, with ruby red hints to it, and a froth, generous head.

Smells of slightly sour, fresh yeast, rustic bread malts and toffee hints, resulting into a slightly sweeter malt body, which overall still appears to be very earthy.

Tastes dryer than expected, with a decent bitterness, coating up the bready, toasted malts. Malts then turn even more present, introducing a caramelized aspect to the palate, still carried by a grainy bread foundation. Returning with with a slick aspect to it, the bitterness shines again during the finsih, supported by a well fitting carbonation, while there is almost no sweetness left, leading to a well balanced finish.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Nice caramel colour on the body, with a thin, one finger tall head, very light beige in colour and soapy. Good retention for its size, left heavy lacing on my glass.
Very nice aroma of light roasted malts, along with some milky chocolate notes combined with noble hops.
Really great taste, very very bitter and the bitterness last for quite long as well. Lots of hops on the taste, with some little caramel on the background.
Medium thick body, quite carbonated. Very dry on the palate, gave me a numb feeling in my mouth. The hops are shining here as well.

Nutty, toasted, with a very soft mouthfeel. I got some fruity notes that were flawlessly integrated into the malt profile. Herbal hop finish, seems to be the most bitter out of the traditional Dusseldorf altbiers. Like I wrote before - outstanding.

First rating: Bottle. Really nice, creamy head on top. Ideally harmonic aroma that doesnt need any complexity to impress. Just grassy hops, dried hazelnut and toasted grain that has been kept in a basement for a while. Plain and simple. Soft, velvety mouthfeel, slightly sticky from the full-bodied maltiness, and pleasantly so, wonderfully balanced by a strong bitterness in the flavourful, malty, nutty and hoppy finish.

1437,"2002-11-27",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2005 Bottle: strong hoparoma with just a bit of licorice. Assertive, herbal hoppy flavor with, again, a hint of licorice. Good maltiness, without being sweet. Excellent altbier, highly underrated.
Brewery tap: Flowery, hoppy flavor. Malty. Hint of fruit in the background. Good but somehow I like the bottled version more.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
1437,"2002-09-23",2.7,"bright amber -the colour of a glass of black tea. very fruity and not very interesting. heaps of rotting mandarin, banana and melon soaked in caramel. slightly spicy thick finish.","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"
1437,"2001-11-23",3.4,"I want to upgrade this beers rating, but I admit to working from memory (not live), so Ill review it at a later stage!
The appearance is everything you would expect from altbier, with a good head of foam.
The aroma is clean altbier.
The flavor and palate are good alt quality, with light body, medium-bitterness and slight hoppiness in the aftertaste, which is quite simply fresh and tasty, excellent session beer, like all real Düsseldorf Hausbrauerei Altbier!  I drank this for years...","Sterrebeek, BELGIUM","Belgik"
1437,"2001-06-04",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 22, 2014 Amber and a bit glowy, aroma is earthy caramel.  Sweet palate, modest caramel with light apple fruitiness and light bitterness. Slightly toasty off-dry finish.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
