A decent enough dubbel, but it feels a bit light for the style to me, even though the carbonation tends to the soft. Theres a little hop bitterness coming through, and even just the faintest hint of sourness, that isnt indicated by standard guidelines.

Foam, beach foam at the shore-line, just enough to make your day at the beach memorable. Enough to trap sea-life.

Dubbel forward but fails to stay the night. Get in, get off, get out. True Belgians will stay through the night and make breakfast. The initial onslaught leads me to believe I am enjoying a certified Belgian, but alas a copy. 

I did note the 9% on the label...that's why I purchased this unknown to me. Yes I like the warmth, but I also enjoy a tasty brew. You my friend failed in the end to follow-through.

591,"2013-03-04",3.4,"August 15th, 2012 - Most markets separate the fancy beer collections into two segregated groups. The first belongs mostly to American made craft beers, sometimes mingling the single bombers with the colorful bricks and block designs of stacked six-packs. The second section belongs to the foreign and imported beers, usually of Belgian origin, and sometimes the odd American beer whose price tag better fits with the Belgian stuff. And heres my problem. On a tight budget, I feel like I can get more beer for my buck when I go for the domestic craft brewers. This means Ive spent a lot more time with hops than I would like and a lot less time with Belgian flavors than I would prefer. Brother David comes to the rescue, delivering many of those core Belgian yeasty flavors at an affordable price point. The Dubbel from Anderson Valley pours a murky deep brown, emitting an aroma with a light soy sauce scent, ample molasses and brown sugar, a pinch of nutmeg and a general sweetness that makes me feel like Im smelling the dessert cart at a fancy restaurant. The flavor pushes forward onto the palate with tons of alcohol, broken up by deep soy sauce tanginess and the deep, dark sweetness of fig in the back. Broadly this is a woody and deep flavored beer, but the alcohol is a little too dominant, and it interferes with the grander potential thats lurking in the background noise. This might be a good candidate for aging, but since I have just one bottle, I have to evaluate it as is. Again, having those Belgian tastes at a price that doesnt make my wallet and my heart wither is nice, but its also an indication of what that extra money goes towards - the real deal.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

591,"2012-04-27",3.5,"Bottle. Kind of on the imperial side of the Dubbel category. Pours with a very clear mahogany to very deep bronze hue, clear with reddish highlights, medium to slightly smaller head for the style. Off-white head doesnt last fully. Some alcohol/viscous legs rise above any lace and bat it down slightly. 

Strong and complex aroma balancing malt and yeast. A plethora of dark fruits, plums, cherries, dates, raisins. Some pear, very light isoamyl acetate as well. Persimmon. Some nutty and light chocolate (fudge notes), caramelized and brown sugars. Light tangyness and low phenol. A bit of a floral, earthy presence that might be a bit of hop.

 Flavors show the alcohol. Warm, malty. A bit of an odd/too apparent nutty/toasty/earthy/lightly tannic character going on (at first, but it seems to fade (or get overrun by alcohol) as it warms). Big dried fruit character, dates, figs, raisins, persimmon. Lightly rummy and vinous, some floral notes. Malt character once warm is rich in a toasted malt way. Light musty quality from the yeast to go with the dark fruit esters. Very slight phenol presence. Medium sweetness through to the finish which is dry. Slight mineral character felt on the tongue in the finish. Lightly leathery. Some balancing bitterness and alcohol last through the aftertaste.

Big and warming! Fuller body with medium-high carbonation. Pretty dry on the finish which is nice.

Overall a pretty good interpretation of the style. In California fashion, this is a big version of the style with slightly more hop character than I am use to in the style. Still tasty. One problem I seem to find with American made dubbels are that they finish way too sweet. This one thankfully follows a more traditional model with dryness.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

Pours a burnt red bordering on brown with an off white head and a good amount of sticking lacing. Smell is cherries, chocolate, caramel, and nuts. A bit of spice. Taste brings forward some dark fruits as well as dark cherries and a bit of caramel and toffee. Mouthfeel is nice and coats the palate. Drinks quite well and is certainly one of the better American versions of this style that I have had.

One thing: I like how Anderson Valley doesnt heat pasteurize their beer, but I cant stand the layer of yeast on the bottom that I cant stand having in my beer; I will not drink the last fifth because I mentally cant handle ""dirty"" beer.

How: Bottle 22oz.  Sent by (I think) by my summer Secret Santa.  Thanks a lot Secret SantaI mean Dave.
The look: Dark ruby body topped by a small beige head
In long: Nose is sweet and fruity, smelled like a raisin pie to me.  Taste brown sugar, raisins, baked dark fruits, almonds, some chocolate, some black cherries, some toffee, minimal woody hops contribution.  A little burnt malts sensation as if the beer was 80% toasted sugary caramelized malts and 20% totally burned malts.  All the desired dubbel flavours are there but somehow the whole thing just doesnt stand out.  I didnt find the mouthfeel very Belgian with its medium prickly carbonation.  As far as an American Belgian style dubbel is concerned this one is pretty decent..  But compared to true Belgian dubbel this is just average.

The aroma is standard dubbel fare, big fruity notes of raisins, prunes, and figs accompany brown sugar and molasses malts, with mild winter spices lending a bit of earthiness.  It smells slightly boozy, and some estery, doughy yeast adds some calming influence.  Flavors mirror the nose, mostly sweet and malty, with a big caramel, fig, and raisin presence.  The yeast is lightly peppery, and traces of nutmeg lend further, balancing depth.  Medium bodied and light to moderately carbonated, the semi-warm palate neither excites or offends.  Its a decent brew, pretty standard for a dubbel.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

The floral qualities of the flavor on this one, especially the finish, kinda surprised me - again Im reminded of the Chimay Bleue. Mouthfeel is thin and smooth.

591,"2007-12-05",3.9,"THOUGHTS: The taste was great at first, but then drooped off a lot. It seemed like a nice Belgiam recreation, but was only halfway there. Maybe that was due to the seeming lack of bottle conditioning. Not the best dubbel, but a still a really nice beer. Bottle. Poured a dark red that was almost brown in the glass with a small, off-white head that mostly diminished. The aroma was moderate caramel malt with apple, brown sugar, a little alcohol, spices and wither a port wine or brandy. The initial flavor was lightly sweet and slightly sour, while the finish was moderate to heavy sweetness with an average duration. The flavor had lots of spices up front along with brown sugar, some alcohol, more spce and dark fruit. Then the flavor becomes flat halfway through the mouth. If it werent for that it would have a nearly perfect flavor. The medium body was lightly fizzy with a light alcoholic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

591,"2006-09-24",3.0,"As I pour this the beer shows a brilliantly clear brown color, but it sits in my glass a completely opaque dark brown color.  The beer has an initially two-finger thick, brownish tinged tan head.  As I pour this a fruity note similar to rum wafts from my tulip glass.  Concentrated sweet malt notes are found initially in the nose.  The nose is a melange of caramelized malts, brown sugar, toasted glazed bread and an underlying fruitiness reminiscent of raisins and prunes.  The aroma is definitely missing the spicy notes that are in a good Belgian Dubbel.

Thick and sweet up front, almost a shock to the palate.  One expects a double to be rich yes, but with a certain lightness and quaffability that this brew doesn’t even remotely have.  Sweet with sticky caramelized malt notes, raisin like fruitiness and a touch of toasted grain character.  The toasted grain notes help to add a touch of balance to the otherwise dominant sweet character.

This is not a bad beer, there are certainly no flavor flaws, but one expects an entirely different beer from a Belgian styled Dubbel; adding some spiciness and substantially drying this beer out would certainly be a good place to start.  As is it might pair well with a chocolate dessert.

The dark fruits were very subdued and overcome by the alcohol astringency (very undeveloped stuff going on here).

591,"2006-05-22",3.3,"This is obviously an American made dubbel. It has neither the complexity of Belgian dubbels nor the character. With that being said, its a really good beer thats not hard on the wallet like some Belgain dubbels can be. Aroma was plums, spicy, figs and malty. Appearance was a deep dark brown. Flavors were satisfying with notes of said plums, figs, sweetness (really sweet in fact) and the malt character. As I said, overall an enjoyable American made dubbel.

Yet, after those complaints, I did find it oddly drinkable and it grew on me over time, but that might have been due to the 9.0 ABV kicking in.

Taste; initially the alcohol has a very strong presence. Once you get past that the fruit flavors of raisins and plums come out, as well a bit of spices and some chocolate. Once I let this warm up a bit the alcohol was more subdued than it was with the first few sips. Mouthfeel is a bit weaker than I would have expected for a double, especially with the low carbonation.

591,"2006-01-10",3.0,"Very filtered pour shows a maroon to brown appearance covered by a light off-white film. Gently toasted raisin bread aromas speak of a malt-yeast balance attempt that heads toward buttered werthers originals, toffee and licorice sweetness. Earthy scotch character grows almost soily, and definitely barky in mouth. The alcohol remains competently in the background, but the filtered structure shines through a rather thinned-out body where only mellow to soft carbonation does not really invite us toward the next sip. A bit simplistic, but pretty much what is expected by an American attempt at this tough style to master.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

-An attractive head recedes over dark mahogany.
-Roasting prunes and dates are tickled by prominent alcohol.
-Brown sugar hides as chocolatey yeast.

What if you dig deeper?
-Some black pepper resides behind the yeast.
-The low carbonation allows us to perceive the slightly toasted bread crusts.
-The mouthfeel gets lifeless after a while in the glass.
-A simple dubbel without much character, while remaining a nourishing drink.

This dark amber ale poured with a small off-white head, eliciting a malty chocolate aroma. The flavor, too, was of roasted malt and chocolate, with a bit of fruitiness.

591,"2004-10-22",3.5,"Bottled. Dark brown, brief beige head. Aroma of plum brandy and coffee. Sweet and roasty, softly malty with drier, salty bitter finish. Decidedly more balanced than their Triple.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
591,"2004-10-14",3.4,"Somewhat cloudy, peach amber with streaks of gold. Gorgeous. Foamy white head is just right. Smells of cherries, sugar, rasberries, orange peels and light citrus. Taste is syrupy and somewhat astringent, tart acid and alcohol.  Lactate/soured milk flavors paired with pit-fruit/plums and citrus hops. Provided to me by my great friend jgb9348 and enjoyed on the Eastern Shore of Virginia.","Cochabamba, BOLIVIA","JonR888710"

591,"2004-10-10",4.1,"Draft.  A great American version of this style--indeed, perhaps the best I have ever had.  This showed the level of viscosity which is absolutely vital, but sadly lacking in U.S. dubbels, and it provided a perfect structure for tons of chocolate and orchard fruit flavors.  Rivals Westmalle.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"

591,"2004-08-18",3.5,"Deep dark burgundy body topped by a rocky tan head. Glass lacing is above average. The aroma is a strong hit of pears and alcohol.  The flavior is fairly sweet and pleasant, the pear discovered in the nose is still here as well as some slight bitterness. The alcohol is not a problem here as it is in the triple. Overall much more balanced than the triple, but still not world-class, good yes, but not best in class. Thanks a bunch to MrDick for the bottle.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"

591,"2004-07-29",3.2,"UPDATED: DEC 22, 2006 Head is initially small, frothy/fizzy, light brown, mostly diminishing. Body is medium brown. Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, cookie), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of banana/gum, toffee, brown sugar, and clove. Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lighty acidic, moderately bitter. Medium 
to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. A bit uncomfortably syrupy-sweet in the mouth, but the aroma is decent enough. Certainly much better than the tripel.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Pours a dark dark red, looks black without holding it up to the light, but has an amazing red glow when up to the light. Small ivory head that falls fast. Sweet spicy aroma with lots of banana smell to it. Taste starts sweet and with tons of dark fruit, wheat and caramel, with a good balance and lots of spice in the finish.

591,"2004-07-17",4.0,"Bottle pours brown with deep red highlights, small off-white milk froth like head, soft carbonation, with so-so lacing.   Aroma is of roasted malts, slight dark pitted fruit, and light alcohol.   Candied fruit, figs, dates, and raisins on the front.   Slightly sweet, finishing dark and roasty.   Good mouthfeel, nice body, lingering finish but slight alcohol dominance as it warms.   Anyways, probably one of the better American made Dubbels Ive had.   Dont pass up on this one if given the chance.   Thanks goes out to batkins for the trade!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
591,"2004-07-04",3.5,"Bottle. Brown, slightly reddish, beer with a quickly dissapearing beige-head. Sweet malt aroma thats got some yeast and slight fruitiness to it. The flavor is complex - sweet malt, fruit, yeast, and more, but the trend is toward a slightly swete aftertaste that doesnt quite pull the beer off. Its a shame... if they could cut down on the sweet finish, itd be a better beer.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"

591,"2004-02-27",4.1,"This beer was sampled at the San Diego Strong Ale Festival and was by far the surprise of the show. It poured a garnet red with slight amber color and possessed a tiny tanned head which dissipated within a matter of 20 seconds. The aroma is filled with chocolates and mocha filled notes but also a heavy coffee and vanilla wafting. There is of course some slight yeasty alcoholic aroma to be sensed, but that just tickled my fancy even more. The taste yielded a beautiful cherry and woody mix with big hints of yeasty alcohol and a slight coffee and toffee aftertaste. Definite souring cranberry with slight cherry aftertaste. VERY dry but damn was this good and did it leaving me wanting more. Definitely carbonated like hell...but man did this have one of the better aftertastes of the fest. Another must have!","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

The beer pours to a deep garnet color with a medium sized head that is semi-creamy in texture and a light tan color as it erodes the lace forms a satiny sheet to hide the glass from view.
