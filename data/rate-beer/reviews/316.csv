316,"2017-06-07",4.6,"Bourbon County Brand Barleywine 2016  
 Alkohol:  13,6% obj. 
 Data butelkowania:  19.10.2016 
 Kolor:  Brunatny z rubinowymi prześwitami. 
 Piana:  Niewielka, kremowo-beżowa o hiper-drobnej strukturze. Piana jest cholernie nietrwała. Znika bez śladu w zaledwie kilka sekund.
Aparat nie zdążył nawet ostrości ustawić, 
a piana już całkowicie zniknęła.
Brak krążkowania, brak jakichkolwiek śladów na szkle. 
 Zapach: Aromat jest przepiękny. Wyznacza nowe trendy i niespotykaną skalę jakości tego stylu. Sam nie wiem już czy najpierw wychodzi beczka, czy cały bogaty, owocowy profil trunku.
Na samym początku czuć bardzo wyraźny aromat drewna dębowego i intensywny szlachetny alkohol - bourbon.
Praktycznie na równoległym poziomie mamy całe owocowe bogactwo: jabłka, gruszki, ciemne winogrona.
Czuć słodką woń karmelu, toffi, cukru trzcinowego.
Pod spodem daktyle, rodzynki i odrobina czekolady.
Wącham i wącham, a ślinianki niesamowicie pracują pod wpływem tego aromatu. 
 Smak:  Jest eksplozja! Jest moc! Jest niesamowicie intensywnie.
Przeogromna beczka po bourbonie.
Nie ma tutaj żadnej ściemy, tylko wyraźne nuty dębowego drewna i lekkiej wanilii.
Na języku wyczuwalne są akcenty karmelu, toffi, miodu, cukru trzcinowego, a w tle czekolady.
Pojawia się monstrualna porcja kandyzowanych owoców (jabłka, morele, gruszki).
Na jedną rzecz warto także zwrócić szczególną uwagę - na teksturę piwa.
Nie wiem czy którekolwiek z dotychczas przeze degustowanych Barley Wine (nie wliczając oczywiście Utopisa) może się poszczycić taką gęstością.
Piwo jest tak oleiste i kisielowate, że można w nim niemal łyżkę postawić i będzie stała na sztorc. 
Alkohol jest wyraźny. Rozgrzewa w piersi i w przełyku, ale stanowi wspaniałe dopełnienie.
Nie gryzie, nie wychodzi na wierzch.
Jeden z tych trunków, które chciałbyś mieć na leżaku w nieograniczonej ilości.
Piękne, po prostu piękne!
 Wysycenie:  Niskie w kierunku średniego. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Arcymistrzowski napitem.
Ideał stylu i Top3 najlepszych leżakowanych Barley Wine.
Poziom jakiego nie osiągnęło wielu warzących ten styl. 
Każdy składnik w tym piwie zna swoje miejsce. Żaden z elementów nie wychodzi na wierzch, nie wysuwa się przed szereg.
Wszystko jest doskonale skomponowane i tworzy idealną całość.
Nawet alkohol, który rozgrzewa od środka pasuje do kompozycji.
Podobnie jak Bourbon County Brand Stout jest topowym, niezapomnianym RIS-em, tak BCBW wynosi styl Barley Wine na wyżyny.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"
316,"2017-05-30",2.7,"2013 12oz bottle, drunk October 2016.Caramel-chocolate with darker mahoganies and light clarity on the edges. Dark beige head atop shows moderate to low retention.Whew. Is this stuff only three years old?? Yes it is, but Id never guess that. Tons of oxidation on top of the heavily bready, caramel-and-vanilla accentuated malts with moderate red fruits from both malt and yeast. Not messy at this point, though theres a touch of sharpness here and there. But damn, why is this so oxidized??Same in the mouth as heavy bread, vanilla, light soy and stale caramel give a tired, monotonous impression atop strong, sugary malts and tons of fruity esters. Barrel-aging is done pretty well, providing light spice, hints of tannin and other whiskey-like qualities but its all heavily overshadowed by the heavy, very premature oxidation. To be honest, Id be hard-pressed to believe this is even very interesting without the oxidation, given the heavy overly sugary qualities of the beer.  With a few exceptions, Ive been extremely disappointed by every variation of the bourbon county line.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Price: $14.99
Purchased: Feb. 25, 2017
Consumed: Feb. 25, 2017
Reviewed as: English Barleywine
Misc.: Bottled on Oct. 18, 2016; 2016 version is 13.6 pct. alcohol

Huge get to see this in the stores earlier today. Said I would come back and did about 10 minutes later. Wasnt mad about the $14.99 price. Seemed fair considering the style and it being the first time I had seen this variant in stores. Super excited for this beer.

Poured a dark-to-light black brown color (almost black) with 1-to-2 fingers of fizzy tan head. Light bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass at certain spots. Average watery lacing. Below average retention. (Sight - 3.25)

Smelled dueling notes of boozy bourbon, leathery oak and earthy tobacco up front. Also got chewy caramel squares, toffee, smooth milk chocolate, thick molasses, subdued vanilla, and hints of dark fruits. Seemed just a tad hot early, but was smoothing out toward the end. (Smell - 4.25)

Tasted much better than the nose initially. Got chewy caramel, tobacco, oaky bourbon, vanilla, toffee, sugary milk chocolate, rich molasses, honey (wishful?), maple syrup, dark plum notes and subtle hints of woody anise. (Taste - 4.75)

Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish. (Feel - 4.75)

Very good. Was all over the place on the ratings. Not as good as I was hoping, but still just an exceptional beer. Would like to see a bottle of this sit for a bit. (Overall - 4.50)

I have been scared to drink this for no good reason since I have never had the beer, perhaps the Bourbon barrel character has mellowed sufficiently. A soft, steady pour yields a 1/4-finger thick, dark amber stained, tan colored head. The beer is a concentrated, dark, red-amber color that shows a clear, red hue when held up to the light. The aroma still has some alcohol and Bourbon barrel heat to it, but it is not overwhelming. Nutty notes of oxidized malt, raisins, and a bit of sherry are joined by rich vanillin and toasted coconut. The beer just smells sweet and caramelized; fruit notes of cherry, fig, actually this smells like a dense, malty, caramelized fruit cake in many respects.
Rich feeling, and first it is a ""light"" richness, but then as it sits on the palate it picks up heft, and coats the tongue with a density, and lingering viscosity; the texture is just about perfect for a Barleywine. The finish has lingering vanillin and sweet, toasted coconut, a hint of warming alcohol, and an accentuating, barrel spiciness and heat; though the heat is less than one might expect. As the beer hits my belly I can definitely feel it reacting and ""warming"" my innards. Dense fruit notes lie underneath the barrel character with flavors of raisins, dried figs, perhaps a touch of vanilla infused cherry preserves, . There is also a certain smokiness to be found here; a touch phenolic, and it adds to the richness, it is savory, with an almost preserved, oceanic peat character somehow. Aged malt character adds a richness, boosts the savor / smoky character, and adds a nuttiness to the dense caramel notes.

This was much better than I was fearing; while the bourbon barrel still plays a prominent role, it is well balanced by the dense malt character. I can see this beer aging for quite a bit longer, and it may not even have peaked, though it is probably close, as the oxidation may play a more prominent role as the years go by. I cant imagine a Bourbon Barrel Barleywine being much better than this, it is almost perfect for what it is; the balance of fruit, dense malt, and vanilla/coconut/wood/ bourbon character is a combination fit for an end of a cold winters night.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Pours a dark brown color with glowing ember hints, woven into the beers appearance, which comes along with almost no head at all. It produces a small, bubbly ring of lacing, revealing alcohol legs after swirling.

Smells of bright, sugar coated malts and boozy, ripe plums. Bakers chocolate blends into molasses and a warming oak quality. Roasted walnut shell compliments dried, scented wood and sun burned earth.

Has a pleasantly low carbonation, while featuring a decadent huge, sweet body, defined by sweet malts together with a spicy, oaken dryness. Does not have the thick, creamy mouthfeel the regular version provides, although it offers a pleasant silkness on the tongue.

Tastes of soft earth, hazelnuts, toasted malts and melted caramel among dried, sweet plums. Creates a pleasant sweetness of milk chocolate, wild honey, rock sugar and licorice, finding its balance in the dry, spicy Boubon barrel. Finishes with caramel, fudge and more molasses and a pleasant, boozy dryness, with a nice, bubbly refreshment from the carbonation, preventing the beer from becoming cloyingly sweet. 

Comes very well together, its prominent, taste defining sweeter qualities find their balance in the perfect nuanced Bourbon barrel, which provides enough body to the malts to make this interesting till the last sip.","GERMANY","aleigator"

316,"2016-02-23",4.2,"2015 bottle poured into a snifter.

3.0 A: Deep deep amber color that looks black unless held to a light. A short fizzy head formed with an aggressive pour and vanished almost immediately leaving no lacing.

4.75 S: Like BCS, the nose is overflowing with bourbon. Leather, brown sugar, molasses, and light smoke. Oak and vanilla. The base offers a thick goopy caramel and toffee backbone. Next comes a bevy of fruits including raisin, fig, date, sugar plums, and black currants (and then more black currants). Despite the strong bourbon, the booze is well hidden. Complex and powerful, everything I want in a Bourbon County beer.

4.5 T: So many potent flavors. Molasses comes out even stronger than the bourbon with black currants and dates almost as powerful. Then caramel, leather, raisin, figs, prunes/plums, toffee, chocolate, and brown sugar. Woodiness, smoke, and vanilla follow. Its sticky sweet, perhaps too much so.

4.25 M: Heavy, viscous body. Quite sticky and almost chewy. Moderate carbonation level. Sticky finish with some warming booziness.

4.5 D: Its insanely complex and powerful, but I feel that its much stickier than BCS and because of that its less drinkable. Still, its a wonderful beer!

316,"2015-11-27",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2016 The barley wine expansion of the Bourbon County series, vintage bottle at almost three years of age, still with the previous label. I heard a lot about this and I like my barley wines old, especially when barrel-aged, so this can hardly go wrong, I guess... Thin, pale greyish beige head dissolving quickly but leaving a wafer-thin rim on the edge of the glass and some dispersed flocks in the middle, even leaving a slight amount of lacing; colour is a deep, warm, intense dark burgundy, translucent with a stunningly beautiful ruby glow. The bouquet is as intense as it is seductive and yields countless impressions of the finest Belgian chocolates, candied cherries, vanilla-like tannins and wet oak, very old tawny port, bourbon-like alcohol, madera, espresso touch, caramel, more subtle hints of marmelade, fig, dried tree leaves, maple syrup, Cuban cigars, beef stock, honey liqueur, soft paprika powder, soy sauce. Intense candied sweet onset, candied fig, candied orange, candied cherries, but not cloying, kept in place by a deep, soft, very mildly balsamic-like sourishness and big meaty umami flavours extending well over the whole palate; carbo is tingling a little bit on the edges of the tongue but otherwise goes by unnoticed. A deep caramelly and softly chocolatey maltiness with lightly nutty edges underlies this wonderful array of flavours and bears a kind of subtle metallic tinge, but in this case feeling completely natural and only adding to this wonderful experience; this maltiness becomes more toastedly bittersweet in the end, where further drought is achieved by an accent of peppery hops subtle enough to only accentuate the fat malt character, as well as lovely drying wood and, inevitably, a warming glow of unmistakably bourbon-like, but also very liqueurish alcohol, not becoming astringent at any point. Mouthfeel is expectedly very vinous, more so than wine, in fact very sherry- or port wine-like. Bittersweetness, the key flavour combination to any good barley wine (and many other of the great classic beer styles), has been achieved to perfection here. I suspect the two years of cellaring have softened the alcohol and the hop bitterness a bit, improving the overall quality significantly, but the result is one of the most balanced, rich, sensual and perfect barley wines I ever tasted. In fact, since Im a sucker for the style (which admittedly pushes my rating upward), this easily belongs to the best beers in general I ever tasted - tasting this is like making love to Ninkasi - the Sumerian beer goddess - herself. Truly divine, in other words: this is the kind of beer Id confront the biggest wine snob with, if only to prove what beer is capable of. Unforgettable - I am so glad I bought this goddess, and had the patience to wait till the time was right to consume her...  I even considered giving this a perfect 5/5, until I stumbled upon a younger bottle (with the new labels) which was clearly a bit infected, not in a stinking way, but nevertheless inelegantly souring and dismantling an otherwise perfectly harmonious structure.  Too bad, but I have to take this second tasting into account, so my rating here reflects both versions.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

316,"2015-11-22",4.5,"Pours a very dark chestnut brown color thats completely opaque with a 1.5 finger frothy beige head that very slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Excellent retention, taking a while to finally settle and leaving large chunks of soapy lacing behind. 

Very inviting aroma with beautiful barrel character thats perfectly integrated into the barleywine notes of the base beer. Nicely charred oak with subtle dry toothpick as well as some sweet, spicy bourbon, toasted coconut and a silky vanilla bean sweetness. Lots of spirit and barrel but it doesnt overpower the leathery malts and vinous dark fruit notes of the barleywine. Hints of caramel, toffee and tobacco along with some raisin, plum and fig. Smells amazing and Im not sure how much it could improve. 

Full body wih a strong boozy barrel character thats excellently integrated into the barleywine flavors of the base. Sweet and boozy but not overwhelmingly hot or one-dimensional. The barrel flavors are very strong but the leathery malts and dark fruit sweetness still stand out. Lots of sweet, spicy bourbon along with dry, toasted oak, marshmallow, toasted coconut and vanilla bean. Underneath the barrel, there is some slightly smokey, leathery malt followed by dark fruit and lighter malt sweetness. Leathery tobacco flavor countered by caramel, toffee, hazelnut and very sweet dark fruit notes, notably raisin, fig and plum. The spirit flavor is pretty strong but this beer only has slight heat and subtle warmth in the chest. The high ABV is relatively well masked making this complex and near perfectly balanced beer dangerously drinkable. Excellent! Hard to find fault with a barrel aged barleywine thats so strong right out of the gate. This should age gracefully and Im looking forward to seeing how it develops over time.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Les arômes sont cependant plus discrètes que les saveurs et le mouthfeel qui sont bien plus saturés (une telle chose est-elle vraiment possible?). Saveurs de bourbon poussées à lextrême dans un vieux grenier où sont entreposés des milliers de sacs de grain mouillés. Une quantité de malts comme on en rencontre rarement, du tonneau de bois, de lalcool à profusion (je me répète)... Très longue en bouche, beaucoup trop puissante pour mon palais, à mon avis déséquilibrée (une pointe damertume aurait été la bienvenue ici). Peut-on encore appeler ce truc une bière?","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

316,"2014-12-10",4.2,"My Bottom Line:
Sensuous vanilla bourbon draws in dried fruit in this intensely caramelized and aromatic Barrel-Aged Barley Wine.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam crowns the dark mahogany.
-The mouthfeel is wealthy, silky and warming.
-The aroma is boastful but really inviting.
-The fruitiness is reminiscent of raisins.
-The alcohol is well hidden under the sugar.
-This can spoken of in the same sentence as Lost Abbeys Angels Share and Revolutions Straight Jacket, for example.

Sweet caramel and chocolate contrasts against the oak perfectly. Mouthfeel is like almost nothing Ive had before - thick, velvety with a slight fizz.

316,"2014-10-08",4.4,"Transfer from BA review on 1-13-14-

 Poured from bottle into a snifter

 Appearance  The beer pours a murky mahogany/brown color with tons of particulates seen floating about. Upon pouring there is a tiny bit of fizzy foam that forms atop the brew. This fades almost instantly leaving almost no lace on the sides of the glass. Upon swirling the beer in the glass some fingers of thick beer stick to the sides of the glass slowly fading back to the base of the snifter and again leaving almost no lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is heaviest of sweeter smells with tons of caramel and toffee. Along with these smells are some aromas of roasted malt nature with some chocolate and darker bread as well as some other more fruit like aromas of orange, fig, and raisin. Along with these aromas are some big smells of oak with a good dose of boozy bourbon as well. Some smells of a more earthy and grassy nature are there as well, mixing with the rest to produce and overall sweet and oaky barleywine smell.

 Taste  The taste follows the nose rather nicely. It begins with tons of sweetness of caramel and toffee. The caramel starts out stronger in the taste, but as the taste moves on, the toffee really takes over, giving a more buttery flavor to the beer. Along with the sweet, are some chocolate and oaky flavors upfront, which while they start out lighter, get quite potent toward the end. Notes of hop come to the tongue more toward the middle of the taste. They begin mostly of an herbal nature with some earthy tastes coming later on. A moderate amount of a tobacco taste develop from the beginning to the end combining with the herbal and earthy tastes to give a bit of a green flavor to the brew. Toward the end the oaky flavors get rather potent and are combined with some darker fruits of raisin and fig as well as some nice bourbon flavors that develop more toward the middle and the end of the taste. The combination of flavors that is left, with all the transitions of the oaky, sweet, and hop flavors of the brew, end up leaving an oaky bourbon, sweet, and lightly hopped boozy flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. Both are quite fantastic for the big, sweet, bourbon and oaky flavors of the brew and make this beer a nice slow sipper just as it is intended to be.

 Overall  A nice sweeter, slow sipping, barleywine with plenty of nice bourbon and oaky flavors. This is one to sit down with on a cold evening night in front of a fire slowly sip away while reading the paper or a nice book.","","Darkmagus82"

A syrupy dark brown with a dense, foamy head with excellent retention and minimal lacing, this beer has nice legs. The nose is big, boozy, sweet and decadent.

Vanilla and rum; a little bit of oak and char are present. Moderately fruity with plums and raisins present. Yum. The palate opens with a big sweetness and a moderate heat. In the vein of an English BW, Thankfully, not as prune-heavy as King Henry was. Caramel, toffee, brown sugar, a little bit of burnt sugar, a little earth and leather are noticeable, along with a blend of raisins and dates deglazed with rum. Vanilla, a little oak, some rum and bourbon character are present. A dusting of cocoa is present, particularly in the way the roasted malt flavors play off the fruity and sweet flavors.

Poured from the tap into a Goose Island sipping glass.

The color is a dark black with no highlights. There is a finger of foamy brownish head with no lacing left on the glass.

The smell is strong oak aroma with hints of vanilla. There is a smoky aroma that is from the char in the barrel. The aroma just fills the nose with character is a lingering, holding that oak barrel smell for a while.

The taste is vanilla with a dark cherry and oak flavor. There is a deep boozy flavor that is very reminiscent of whiskey but has a nice malty finish.

There is a presence of dark fruit, blackberries and boysenberries are just hidden around the edges at this beers flavors continue after finishing eat sip.

316,"2014-08-02",4.1,"Vintage 2012. The dense garnet pour settles with very little head. Regal tobacco smoke envelopes the layers of dark pit fruits while the stick swath of bourbon contributes coconut, melon, and vanilla. 

The balance of intricately composed malt structure and dynamic barrel character is excellent, if more often favoring bourbon and oak flavor than I would like; hops are appropriately muted. 

The fulsome, gentle texture is pure liquid velvet. Soft heat never does more than lie beneath. Amazing composure to this.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

316,"2014-03-29",4.8,"Rating #400. 12 oz bottle into a snifter. The pour is almost stout-like. Its extremely dark brown with a gorgeous garnet or ruby character through the light. There is a dark khaki head that fades down to a thin ring, leaving some spotty lace. The aroma is big on dark fruits. There is a nice subtle roasty caramel note underneath the fruits. There is a little heat toward the back end with a strong bourbon character on the rear of the nose. The flavor is a thing of beauty. The strong dark fruit carries through the whole thing and makes me think that barleywines should be based on this. The roast and caramel are also equally delightful going over the palate. There are light vanilla and bourbon flavors present through the back end, which do pack a little heat. The mouth feel is just perfect. Thick, velvety, and creamy with a perfect medium carbonation and it just coats the mouth amazingly. The aftertaste packs a little heat, but leaves a wonderful slightly dry, raisin-ish, bourbony aftertaste. This is just stellar

A: Pours a murky dark brown color. Practically no head is formed - there isnt even much of a collar. The head is off-white color, I guess. It doesnt look like much at all, but given what this beer is, its a moot point.

S: And right before, sweet bourbon character hits the nostrils immediately. Vanilla, coconut, oak; you name it, its here. Here, its backed by a wonderful dark fruit aroma and (slightly) lesser chocolate notes. This smells like it will be one of the best dessert beers ever.

T: Holy frig. The opening flavors are heavy in vanilla, coconut, and bourbon. But that finish...dear lord, dat finish - what a vibrant explosion of dark fruit goodness. The finish becomes more caramel-forward as it gradually opens up. Theres a slight booze note post-swallow and its hardly a distraction. Some slight barrel comes through here, too. This brew has a lot to offer in terms of complexity and flavor, with everything easily distinct yet harmonious and well balanced (if rather sweet - hey, its a barleywine). In many ways, its even better than regular BCBS.

M: The secret here is how much smoother it is than most in the style. Even with a faint alcoholic bite, its wonderfully soft yet with a cake-like density. It goes down as easily as a 12% barrel-aged monster can go down. 

O: Ive had a few barrel-aged barleywines before (Sucaba and Insanity spring to mind), but this is so far above those two its not even funny. Everything here is brilliantly defined without being moronic. Best barleywine Ive ever had? More like one of the best beers Ive ever had.

Appearance - the body is very dark brown, its essentially black; liquid is opaque, but held to the light you can note that it doesnt appear to be fully filtered, there are particulates; head is small about 1/4"" and tan/beige ~ it rapidly rings out and leaves a thin halo with three little foam islands.
Taste - Wow!!! That is complex - there are a multitude of things going on here - dark fruit from cherries, figs, dates, prunes, raisins; dark molasses, alcohol (but subdued for sure); tobacco, vanilla, and spices (there is more, but its complex)
Palate - Wow! This is truly unique, maybe the most complex palate Ive ever had. Body is full; texture is slick, sticky, chewy, and thick - its literally all those things at once. Carbonation is soft; finish is not as alcoholic as I would have thought, its got a vaporous alcohol smolder on the tongue, and its not abrasive in any conceivable way. Its a feeling like if you were to drink maraschino cherry juice. Its a consistency of that. Radical!

316,"2014-01-29",4.0,"Bottled September 17, 2013.
Appearance: Out of the bottle this pours incredibly murky and ruddy looking. In the glass the beer is an opaque brown/reddish thats completely opaque in the glass. Barely any head is coaxed from the body as well, just a very thin tan ring.
Aroma: The aroma is huge of dark fruits, raisin practically jumps from the glass. Backing the huge fruitiness is a mild bourbon, huge caramel and a slight cherry tobacco presence. This is hugely fruity though and isnt afraid to show it.
Taste: The taste is even incredibly fruity, but very pleasant. Oak pokes through once in a while along with hints of caramel, but this is syrupy raisin juice with a slightly spicy finish. The lingering finish is syrupy juice, very light oak, very light bourbon and practically no presence of alcohol. Very nice.
Palate: Thick and syrupy, almost no carbonation.
Overall: I cant get over how fruity this is. I dont get much barrel, but this masks the ABV incredibly well. This is a great beer, it could be a bit more complex, but Id buy it again.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Flavor is quite roasty for a barleywine with notes of coconut, vanilla, coffee, and a long toffee finish. This is really good, but I think its gonna be blackout-good in 6-12 months. Drank this at cellar temp which is the way to go for me. The times I had this on tap, it was too cold to get all the depth this has to offer. Alcohol is well hidden.

Very dark brown that sits almost black in the glass. Very small fully diminishing head that left no lace. Flavor is very sweet and bitter. Palate is very full bodied and oily soft with a cloying finish. Overall one of the best smelling barley wines ever. Right up there with King Henry. Aroma and taste are off the scales with layers and complexity. The palate is too cloying and the beer is not sexy in the glass. Its actually kind of off-putting with this nasty dark brown hue with no head. Looks like chew spit. Palate is good until the cloying finish. That being said its still just a great brew.

316,"2014-01-17",4.4,"12 oz bottle. Aroma is full of wood, coconut, booze, raisins, astringency that tapers off as it warms in the glass. Pours murky brown with a dissipating beige head. Taste is exactly what I look for in a barleywine these days. Sorry, Avery Hog Heaven, Bigfoot and the host of British originals out there, but this is what I crave when I see a label with the word barleywine on it. Barrel aging really does wonders! Texture is oily, carbonation fairly soft, body very full. Full disclaimer: Im predisposed to be an enemy to whatever Anheuser-Busch has anything to do with. Ive been involved with their competition for over half my life. I was born to hate Budweiser and everything they stand for from a very young age. I dont know how much influence the big wigs have in the production of these specialty beers under the Goose Island name, but I would guess that its at a very low percentage compared to all the other beers they make. Hopefully they dont ever decide to step in and dumb these things down like theyve done with so many other brands they have control of.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"

316,"2014-01-16",4.0,"12oz bottle. 
Aroma is rather dark for a barleywine and closer to an old ale. Lots of dark caramel, toffee, light chocolate and roast, and moderate treacle. Raisin, fig and prune fruit notes in medium quantities to compliment the malt. Light alcohol spice becoming more prevalent as it warms as do the fruit notes. 
Pours dark brown with some ruby highlights and lighter brown hues on the edges. Small dark tan head appears on the edges then quickly disappears. No lacing and sheets of liquor more than legs. 
Flavor is similar to the aroma though the fruit notes, especially the raisin and prune seem stronger. Moderate sweetness with a lot of dark caramel and toffee. Lighter roast notes with medium light chocolate and treacle. Light bourbon notes and faint oak, but they are definitely overshadowed by the malt and fruit notes. Medium bitterness and some light alcohol spice in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is full bodied with low to medium low carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a pretty nice beer, but the malt character and the fruit notes kind of overpower some of the more nuanced character. Smooth and easy to drink though.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

316,"2014-01-07",4.1,"The beer pours a dark, ruby-brown with a fluffy off-white/nearly tan head of large, soda-like bubbles. The head is surprisingly large, but quickly fizzles away to a nice fat scrim that is continuously fed by carbonation from the bottom of the glass. In the glass, the beer looks pretty much like a stout or imperial porter, the light reddish hue is the only thing that really sets it apart. In body the beer is a very deep, clear ruby that is a few touches away from being opaque. On the nose, the beer is rich and decadent. Spicy bourbon, rich oak tannin, vanilla, coconut, and then thick fudge, molasses bread, plum pudding, and toffee play across the nose. The barrel is strong, but not the overriding character in the nose, which I quite like. With a bit of age the nose of this beer alone could really develop into something quite amazing. As is, the nose is intriguing, boozy, and rich. On the tongue, the beer tastes decadently sweet with a touch of acidity that gives a pop. The finish is rich alcohol that becomes only a touch hot and solvent-like in closing, but does dry out. Very soft bitterness from both tannins and herbal hops can be felt in the middle and finish of the sip some of the sweetness. In flavor, the beer begins as spicy wood, blooming into rich bourbon soaked molasses bread, brown sugar, fudge with bits of toffee in it, and plum pudding. Touches of dry raisins float across the palate and the bourbon flavors definitely suggest soft vanilla, as well. The finish bring rich dark fruits, a touch of banana, and fudge beside spicy alcohol and just a touch of solvent. The beer is decadent, boozy, and delicious. I wish there was a little less booze, but I think age would definitely help with that problem. In the mouth, the beer feels full, and oozingly smooth. Little to no carbonation can be sensed, and the mouth is left tingly with booze but still wet in the cheeks, though the tongue feels a bit dry. Overall, I am quite surprised by this beer. I like bourbon barrel aged barleywines, but they arent really my favorite thing. This one, however, is rich and full of malt character that I really enjoy. The bourbon flavors are light and perfectly complement the other flavors. With a little more age, this beer will be delicious. This beer is worthy of a try for sure.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

Nose shows as thick vanilla caramels... golden raisins and malted milkballs... still plenty of bourbon and oak... something that makes me think of maple syrup.

Flavor is rich and boozy... mirrors the aromas perfectly... waves of malt complexities are capped perfectly by vanilla caramel... figgy/dates ... sweet leathery tobacco/cigar wrapper... finish is long and spicy from the EtOH and bourbon soaked oak.

316,"2013-12-23",3.6,"On tap ; Pour is murky dark brown with a hint of mahogany , with a one finger khaki head into this glass - it retains on the average side, i suppose, with some lacing present as well. The nose is booze; the barrel treatment provides earthy charred oak, bourbon notes, a touch of vanilla, while moving to the sweeter side of things with caramel and molasses present. This brew needs to mellow out for sure - its hot initial ; booze and dark fruits initial - it lingers here and while this somewhat of a mess becomes more tame with the lowering of temperature, I still think it needs some time. Anyway - its not like it isnt worthwhile right now - the char, earth, vanilla notes do come through, with more fruity undertones than I would have expected - while the malt backbone provides sweetness that perhaps overbalanced the hop profile here.

Toffee, oak, brown sugar, and the other flavors present in the nose do well to balance the 12.1% abv(not to say this isnt a hearty velvety sipping beer).

316,"2013-12-09",4.6,"Bottle off the shelves of Gator Beverage. Didnt think I had a chance to find it in stores after I missed Black Friday. Pours a dark murky brown with a ring of yellow brown head. Aroma of big chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, broen sugar, oak, some figs. Wow, maybe the best smelling of the style I have encountered. The stout influence is present with big chocolate notes up front. Flavor is a medley of chocolate covered figs up front with plenty of bourbon, but the booze is much more subdued than the stout. A second wave of flavor comes with a nutty vanilla caramel that coats the palate. Incredible lingering flavor. The booze is there and warming but this drinks pretty easy. Low carbonation with a very full body a bit short of viscous. Sweet but very balanced and not cloying at all. As I sip more, the fruit character begins to come out with nutty raisins and fig with a good bit of brown sugar and molasses.  So glad I have a few more of these on the way! Lived up to my expectations. This would be perfect for my tastes if it had a bit more of the caramel and vanilla that hung around and less of the fruit character, but that is seriously nitpicking.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"

A - Pours pitch black with a one finger tall tan head, dissipating down to next to nothing, leaving no lace at all down the glass. 


S - Smell of mild bourbon, caramelized brown sugar, vanilla, fresh baked toffee, dark fruits and some mild booziness. Smells great, just gets a little too boozy at the end, some more time should help that out.


T - Starts off with the combo of sweets - Mainly the vanilla, brown sugar and toffee - quickly giving way to a mix of dark fruits, oak and warming bourbon. Finish is still pretty sweet with a smooth hit of warming booze, lingering on the palate long after the finish. The flavors are well integrated and the bourbon isnt over the top which is nice.

Then, the barrel flavors come around with a signature BCBS aftertaste. This is surprisingly drinkable, going down smooth. Whereas with BCBS I have to sip it slowly, I had to pace myself with this one. Its so smooth and goes down so easily. The only flaws, if you can call them that, are that the taste is slightly raw and fleeting. The beer feels so substantial, but the taste fades a little too quickly.

Sweet, rich aroma of chocolate fudge, caramel, toffee, cherry candy, tobacco and alcohol. Taste is very boozy but remains smooth. Caramel and toffee are strong here but the underlying chocolate, candy, and tobacco are great too. Medium to thick body, sticky and chewy mouthfeel. Finish is very long and boozy with a hint of chocolate. Awesome stuff here. Just the right amount of sweetness for a BB barleywine. Wish I had some bottles because this will be awesome with a little age.   Re-rate 2/22/14 from bottle.  Aroma is the same as my original rate except I dont get any alcohol this time.  And the taste is just awesome.  Not nearly as boozy this time.  Just perfect balance of cherry, toffee, caramel, tobacco, vanilla, and oak.  Perfect mouthfeel and finish.  Like a sticky, cherry candy.  This is now my favorite barleywine Ive had.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
316,"2013-12-02",4.2,"2013 Bottle enjoyed at GI Brewpub in Chicago at an event. 

A - Pours like murky toilet water brown. Just think of an English barley wine with 10% imperial stout added. Its not black, and its not brown. Just sort of ugh. Not the most attractive beer ever made.

S - Loads of Caramel and toffee. I also get Chocolate Cream Milk & cookies on the nose. 

T - Taste is a whirlwind of flavor. Obviously, its very boozy being a fresh beer and could benefit from some time in barrels. Very creamy, lots of candy corn and mild hop bitterness. You get a hint of tobacco and a very large candy sweetness. Tastes like a great barley wine thrown into a bourbon barrel with 10% stout added. 

M - Mouthfeel is thick like cough medicine. Very sticky. It really coats the entire mouth and sticks around for a while.

O - I really enjoyed this but now that Ive had it, Im going to take my 4-pack and leave it in the cellar for a year and not touch it. This beer is great and should be tried fresh but get a 2nd one if you can to lay down for a while.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

Flavor is chewy malt base with great dark fruit esters, bourbon, sherry, oak, and vanilla; dry finish. Full body and low carbonation. Very smooth and drinkable.","Federal Hill, Baltimore, Maryland, USA","sonnycheeba"
316,"2013-12-02",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 21, 2014 Midnight black pour with a red/brown hue, deep cocoa brown head a quarter inch high that quickly disappeared to a few small pools on top. Scent similar to standard bourbon county but with more bourbon: deep rich malted grains, bourbon esters, molasses, dark fruits, rich chocolate. Low carbonation, thick oily mouthfeel thats kind of tingly, slick finish. Rich flavor also similar to the standard bourbon county but more spirits: dark fruit, brown sugar, and molasses, strong bourbon thats a bit smokey, some acidic coffee too. Very good and rich beer that is no doubt related to standard bourbon county stout but more acidic, sweeter and with more bourbon flavor. 

After aging a year: Mouthfeel is syrupy with a stickier finish. Bourbon and coffee flavor and aroma are a bit subdued, smokiness is more promenant.","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","bwa5879"

316,"2013-12-01",3.6,"UPDATED: DEC 2, 2013 12.1%. Pours a dark brown with a large creamy tan head that fizzes away fast then slowly leaves about a 1/2 inch of foam atop the beer. SMell is heavy booze, applesauce, dark fruits, caramel, cocoa, coffee, and charred malt. The booze subsides slightly if you let it breathe a little. The flavor is similar, cutting booze, lots of tart fruits, more vanilla and oak presence, less cocoa and coffee, some soy suace. The mouthfeel is sludgy thick with a prickly burn which is oddly off-putting. High octane and thick brew, might hang on to my other bottle, its really boozy. I woudl say a slightly more stouty version of king henry otherwise quite similar.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
316,"2013-12-01",4.0,"Pours a very dark murky brown. with a quickly disappearing brown head. Nice aroma of vanilla up front, dark fruits, caramel, light bourbon, and a hint of chocolate. Caramel up front on the taste, then tons of dates, figs and plums, then there is vanilla and chocolate, roasted malt, bourbon, and a hint of oak. Another great beer, you can really taste the stout in the barleywine. It works quite well.","South Carolina, USA","tdmuel"
316,"2013-12-01",4.0,"Bottle. The pour is a dark amber with nice head. The aroma is subtle bourbon, vanilla, and sweetness. The taste has bourbon upfront, but not too powerful, a nice blend. The taste has dark fruits and sweetness to it. Definitely not King Henry, or kuhnhenn bbbw, but solid nonetheless.

Super dark brown pour with limited head. Aroma was a delicious blend of bourbon, caramel and chocolate. Taste was consistent with the aroma, but wonderfully balanced. I dont know how you can make a 15% beer drink like a session beer, but that what Goose has done. I would have sipped on this all day if I could. The GI employees mentioned this should be an annual release, which makes me very happy.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"

Aroma has notes of huge, sticky toffee, caramel, cocoa dust, oak, prunes, grapes, vanilla, with little hints of coconut. Boozy, but not over the top. The taste continues with a huge wave of brown sugar up front. Caramel, toffee, vanilla, cheesecake notes, slight cocoa powder, booze-soaked oak, & some faint maple in the finish.

Oak, vanilla, and bourbon meld into the toffee, carmel, molasses, and dark fruits. The finish is heavenly. Big sweetness from the carmel, toffee, and molasses, along with dark fruits like raisins, vanilla, bittering hops, oak, and a good amount of bourbon. Getting a butterscotch note in there too. Also get bcbs qualities from the barrel, which stands this beer out in terms of ba barleywines. Get some chocolate and roastiness that go really well with all the other sweet flavors.
