455,"2017-02-25",3.3,"Tap sample at beerbistro. Black with very persistent yellow to beige head. Sweet aroma, like some chocolaty delight with vanilla and cinnamon; same goes for the flavour. A rather strong roasty character once you get past the sweetness. Very fine and rather inactive carbonation, dry roasty palate. Light to medium body. Soft. Slightly boozy even... like, really? A surprising brew. Im kinda parted. Not sure its up to the hype... No 9 of all Stouts and in the 100 percentile and all...

Flavor is a fresh coffee roast with a more subtle chocolate accent, along with what struck my palate as some licorice. Relatively light mouthfeel for a stout, but with the signature silkiness of the oatmeal. Finished with a bitter coffee bean aftertaste.

Ez a kanadai főzet márpedig semmiféle hordóérlelt jegyeket nem hordoz magán, elrugaszkodott összetevőkkel sincs megáldva, mégis kedvező benyomást tesz azzal, ahogy egy egyszerű stoutként is megállja a helyét. A voltaképpen unalomig ismert vonások, mint a pörkölt, pirított kenyérhéjas, kávés és étcsokoládés aromák, a süteménytésztás, kakaós, lágy vonalú ízjegyek jelenléte szinte említésre sem méltó, olyannyira egyértelműnek tekinthetők a sötét tónusok ízbeli megnyilvánulásai. Ami viszont mindenképpen kiemelkedőnek tekinthető, s ezáltal az én olvasatomban lényegét adja a sörnek, az a krémes és puha vonalvezetésű, lágy szénsavhálóval körbeszőtt test, mely visszafogottsága révén érvényesülni engedi az egyes elemeket, általa teljesednek ki a komponensek.","HUNGARY","adster"

Now thats a stout - this is what Guinness wishes it was. (Yes, I once gave Guinness the same rating Im giving this one. That was then, this is now. Deal with it.

Poured oily black, black as a shoe, with a thick dark tan head, building up and staying there for a long time. A 5 for appearance. The aroma, however, was not as perfect. Nice, port, but too much of that olive, leathery tone of North American hoppy stouts on the way. When biting through the head (which still persisted, like a dry pumice stone), the coffee scent invades our nostrils, and only then you get a bit of chocolate. Flavour was much more mellow though, more of what I expected from an oatmeal stout. Dark chocolates, an excessive level of coffee and the roasted malts, so smooth and sweet. Unfortunately it lets through too much of the alcohol, in the end. The flavours were well packed into a round, smooth texture, a lot creamier than I came to expect after that first whiff.

It poured a thick, opaque, motor oil dark brown color with brown foam as well, long-lasting with sticky lace. Excellent protein from oatmeal and unmalted barley. Aromas of cranberry, red grape skins and plum from the roasted grain and ale yeast esters, molasses, caramelized malt, dark toast, hints of chocolate and coffee, really roasty. Same flavors as aromas but breadier, with a smooth, balanced bitterness from earthy hops, burnt barley, and smooth alcohol. Combined with the fruitiness, it reminded me of an aged port or plum-wine. Began with a rich malt sweetness but it finished dry. Creamy and chewy mouthfeel. A bit oxidized with a slight sourness, somehow chalky and acidic at the same time. Medium body and carbonation.This bottle may have been old, but it wasnt a problem for this style. Lingering fruity, bittersweet aftertaste.

St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout pours a deep and dark black with little light penetration. Two finger thick tan head developed with excellent retention. Plenty of lacing was deposited on the glass.

The aroma is classic stout. There are dark roasted malts with coffee and a touch of chocolate. The interesting characteristics of this particular stout include a bit of smoke in the nose.

The taste of this beer has many characteristics shared with Imperial Stouts but deliver them at 5%. Very impressive. The initial tasting is more subtle with coffee and roasted malts and a touch of dark chocolate. There is bit of nuttiness to it. The finish livens up and is a little more assertive. There is a nice bitterness in the finish.

The mouthfeel is creamy with moderate body. The carbonation is perfect for my liking and not too weak like many other stouts.

Dark black with a creamy tan head that leaves beautiful lacing all the way down the pint glass.

The roasted malts, chocolate, coffee and oats really shine through; it starts slightly bitter with some sweetness that quickly disappears, the finish is perfectly dry without overwhelming, full bodied, perfect balance of carbonation, and a finish that while relatively simple is still very well done. Highly recommend trying this if you see it somewhere on tap - but let it warm up.

Raw sugar and smoke are my initial thoughts when tasting, some heavily roasted coffee, that ganache of the aroma at the rear and into the bitter, burnt malt swallow.

455,"2010-11-23",4.0,"12oz bottle.Its a weird contradiction to wonder how this beer received a 100th percentile score both overall and by style while giving it a rating that supports those 100th-percentile scores. At first sip I didnt really think it scored that high. And if I were to rate by flavor alone, I wouldnt rate it so high. But as I filled in the numbers I realized its solid, crunchy, chewy flavor is very well augmented by its lovely roast-grain, toffee and caramel aroma, its dark inky appearance with creamy head that coats the glass with lace, its velvety-smooth palate, and its long, dark-grain and dark-stone-fruit aftertaste. It has all of the attributes one looks for in a great beer in general or a great stout in particular....... and yet I felt it was somehow less than the sum of its parts. It hits all the right notes except for that emotional note that makes me want to pick up more of it. This is the Lexus of beers: refined to such a degree that its perfection is practically sterile and boring. I want to give it a lower rating, I really do. But anyone who has driven a Lexus knows what I mean... you just cant badmouth the damn thing even if youd never want to own one.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

The head is beige, huge, creamy, has great retention and leaves chunky lacing. The aromas are all over, with some roasted malts, grain malts, bananas, molasse and nuts. Goes down very smooth. The taste has the same flavours found in the nose, rosted malt, molasse, light fruits and some coffee and candy. A good bitterness kicks in, in the aftertaste. A very well-brewed and good balanced, excellent oatmeal stout.","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"

455,"2010-04-30",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2012 Some beers are actually better in retrospect than in the moment. Others are great in the moment, but in retrospect you feel you romanticized it too much. However, in the case of St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout, its a beer that was equally great in the moment as it is in memory. A beer that leaves that kind of impact on your brain MUST be good, eh?POUR, COLOR AND AROMAThe beer poured smoothly and formed a thick layer of tan-colored, creamy head which lasted throughout the life of the drink and left some lacing on the glass. The body has all the makings of a classic stout with an opaque black body. No carbonation was noticeable, although the beer did appear to have a more viscous body just from the liquid and head alone. The aroma was light, sweet, and slightly malty. TASTEMost of my beer-drinking occurs after dinner, although many connoisseurs purposely drink with a meal to see how well it compliments. But, a beer like St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout is so sweet and rich that it works much better when drunk on its own, especially as a dessert alternative. This beer has a sweet, roasty taste with a distinct nutty finish. Chocolate, coffee and even a bit of vanilla flavors can be detected - which all combine for a savory palate. Its balanced out with a maltiness to make for a spectrum of great taste.FINISHSt. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout is one of the easiest brews Ive ever consumed, likely due to its overall robust body and seemingly low carbonation. It has a very soft mouthfeel despite maintaining a strong hops presence. However, it does leave a slightly bitter aftertaste in the mouth. BODYGreat beers like this just go to show just how heavy stouts arent. Im not sure of the number of calories and carbs, but I was able to drink two bottles back-to-back after a big dinner without feeling full or overwhelmed. And at only 5% ABV, St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout is the type of beer that could be consumed quickly, easily and in mass quantity (if only it came in six or 12-packs, rather than four-packs).FINAL THOUGHTSI have had sweeter and even tastier stouts, but its hard to find a quality stout that is this satisfying on so many levels. Thats what makes St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout such a great beer in my book.NOTE: watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLzJH0TQAbc","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Aroma: It has a strong brandy/boozy feel to it, along with that is some coffee, bitter chocolate, smoke, and roasted malts

Appearance: It pours a deep black color with a brown head that leaves a thin remnant and spotty lace through the duration

Palate: A smooth beer, though it doesnt have that much body to it, especially for this style, its slightly thin

It says Oatmeal Stout on the bottle, but I didnt get a lot of oats.  Mostly, more of a coffee/roasted stout from what I could taste.

455,"2009-07-09",4.0,"Original review date 5/8/2009...

Served on tap at The Manx (Ottawa) in a traditional imperial Pint glass...

Pours like a classic nitro stout. Clean, velvety maple walnut-colored head. Dry, flat, opaque espresso brown body. Nice carbonation.

There is a grain component on the aroma that is slightly obscured by the nitro carbonation...and maybe a little phenol - very neutral scent otherwise.

In addition to being a solid sessionable stout there is a maple quotient to this along with the oats and patent malt. Very dry - a bit of grassy mellow hops as well.

This drinks very cleanly for its weight class. Maple exudes a certain sweetness on the finish and the nitro brings a velvety character to the game.

Drinks very nicely. I could session this up, and later on at the Ron Hawkins show at Zaphods that evening I did. Brought a few home in bottles as well and it plays nice there too. This is solid stuff.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

Smells like chocolate pudding and ice cream. Theres some mocha in the background. I like that this is not an in-your-face aroma that many stouts have.

A lot more coffee in the taste--nearly no chocolate. Burnt toast, very dry! The finish features the introduction of some hop bitterness, but the black patent malt really comes through long after the swallow. This is a full beer with a slightly higher than expected level of carbonation.

Pour made a small but dense dark caramel cream head, rather thick looking body, with a dark coffee color. A good looking stout. Very full bodied flavor and feel for stout of this kind, especially for the abv.  The feel of this beer is perhaps the best quality of it, as it goes down smooth with a full but not overly heavy creamy body that coats every part of the tongue and palate very nicely.  Sadly, the flavors conveyed dont quite do it for me.  Too much roasted and smoky notes, and a prominent grassy/woody bitterness that is refreshing that it is there but does not seem to fit this beer well as it seems to create this medicinal taste that is slightly off to me.  Some of the more standard notes in there like the black coffee and dark malts, butterscotch and milk chocolate are also in there as well.  So really not a bad stout, it definitely has the framework of a high quality brew.

455,"2009-02-03",4.1,"Appearance: Pours a dark brown, near black body with a frothy, light tan head.

Smell: Roasty, oat-encrusted aroma with notes of unsweetened chocolate and coffee, along with a small whiff of black licorice.

Taste: Pleasing mixture of cold, black coffee, creamy steel cut oats, and chocolate. Medium-low amount of sweetness. Lesser tastes of licorice and vanilla. Faint fruitiness. Earthy, roasty bitterness. Further taste of roasted barley and a light pinch of good, clean soot on the dry finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Decidedly creamy mouthfeel.

Drinkability: Recommended. As an oatmeal stout charged with plenty of flavor and yet still manages to maintain a reasonable ABV%, Id say its got a damned high degree of drinkability.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout actually has a bit of gurgle from the bottle which is unusual for a 5% beer. The body is black as night and wont let a sliver of light shine through. A dense sticky two finger tan head formed on the pour and eventually, slowly fell to a thick cap leaving thick sheet lacing down the glass. I cant imagine an oatmeal stout looking any better then this one.

I met right off the bat by a solid roastiness that quickly combines with a soft hazelnut presence that leads the way through this beer. Coffee grounds and a mild dark chocolate bring up the rear. There seems to be a heavy creaminess that flows like waves through the smell of this beer, rising and falling throughout. This is an impressive smelling stout and for only weighing in at 5% the aromas really pop.

Roastiness bounces off every tastebud as this beer rolls over the tongue. Mild cream and sugar mix with the dark chocolate shavings and coffee grounds. The coffee grounds hit their stride on the swallow and leave a nice roasty bitterness behind. This is an oatmeal stout that is absolutely packed with flavor. I cant recall having a beer with this amount of alcohol have so much robust flavor. This is one high quality brew.

The mouthfeel cant be improved on very much either. There is an incredible silky smoothness that washes over my entire mouth from the oats involved in the brewing process. The carbonation is on the low side of the spectrum and allows the body to work its way through at its own pace.

The robust flavors, insanely smooth mouthfeel, and sessionable abv keep this beer flowing for the entire night. This beer needs to be sold in bigger quantities then just 4-packs. 

This is my last bottle from a recent 4-pack purchase. This is a beer to buy by the case. I still cant figure out how they got this amount of flavor into a stout of such modest abv. I wont hesitate to pick this up in the future and Im glad its a fairly new addition to the IL market.

455,"2008-09-01",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2008 Beautiful.  Intense.  Intimidating.  This lovely quebecois stout pours an inky black; dark as night, and is topped by an enormous, delicious looking, oatmeal colored frothy brown head.  The aromas here are intertwined and complex- rich, dark cacao nibs with lightly roasted French coffee, oatmeal cookies, cream, delicate dark berries, and tiramisu.  Creamy, luscious, oily, and velvety smooth on the palate, this beer first hits the tongue with notes of french roast java and dark, heavily toasted/burnt caramelly malt.  Further sips bring hints of luscious single-origin dark chocolate- bittersweet and complex, balanced by the fruity and tangy dryness of the hops.  This stout is medium-bodied, not overpoweringly rich or alcoholic, and has a delicate drinkability that makes this an ideal beer for chocolate pairings or even session drinking and conversations with friends.  It is warming yet bitter, crisp and fruity.  The tastes are so seemlessly blended and, though the burnt, dark chocolate basically defines the beer, the stringent, bittering, and appetizingly drying hops make a very important contribution in the finish and keep this stout balanced, lively and complex, with a soft and harmonious character that keeps giving.  A very well-crafted beer.","Independence, Kentucky, USA","shalloWMeans"

Dark citrus notes are a little subtle behind the dry aromas. As the brew sits on the tongue, very citrusy, fruity notes arise, much like black cherries. Passing over the palate, a lightly sweet dark chocolate becomes noticeable. Oats begin to dry the back of the palate. Roasty coffee starts to emerge, though, not quite as strong as the description states. Its more of a background flavour. The finish is a little dry and lightly bitter. Traces of a black cherry sourness lasts for quite some time afterwards. There isnt anything that explodes in this beer, but its so well balanced.","California, USA","BossHossBikes"

Pours very, very black and thick, elegant tan head, full but with lovely fine bubbles. This ones a five on appearance. Rich chocolate aroma, slightly metallic, inous hints, malty. Whispers of smoke and grape on the bitter-chocolate-dominated flavor, gently, gently sour, easy drinking, hints of sweetness ducking in at unexpected moments in the flavor profile, that smoke lingering into the finish beyond any serious trace of the hops. After dozens of great big impy stouts, its so refreshing to sit down with a classic like this one. Beautifully done.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Aroma of light chocolate, and some espresso-like coffee and cream.

455,"2008-04-13",2.9,"Pours to a luxurious chocolate brown hue topped with a creeping web of mocha lace.  Aroma is all sturdy graham cracker crust and vanilla extract with bits of sweetened, old espresso and flavored milk.  Sweet, but belying a body full of chunky, muscley malt character.  Flavor doesnt deliver on that suggestion, settling for mostly sweet milk, metallic cheap coffee, sugar, and sterile cherry fruitiness.  Coffee tones tend to carry a soapy, overextracted quality.  Hops tend to present vegetally and with bits of old citrus rinds.  Non dairy graham crust peeks in again with a wink of odd, tangy sweetness in the mid palate.  Palate is light to medium bodied; brittle, unsupported, loose.  Cinnamon tinted oatmeal and some iron water in a lengthy, earthy finish full of minerals.

455,"2008-02-11",3.7,"11.2 oz bottle
I decided to give this a try this week after having it for a while now.  Ive been sampling too many mediocre and so-so beers without giving the cream of the crop a shot.  This one toes that line for me.  It might just be that I am not a huge fan of releases which taste like thinned black coffee but something kept this from making the jump from ""excellent"" to ""outstanding"".  Nonetheless it is worth tracking down if you ever drive through Ohio.
Aroma / Appearance - A thin tan head was less than Id been expecting though still nice to look at.  Underneath was a deep black body with fluidity that rivaled lighter stouts.  The nose was that of a standard American breakfast - black coffee without cream, oatmeal and jam on toast.  It was on par with Breakfast Stout (another beer that I dont like as much as others).
Flavor / Palate - The first sip felt as if this had been cut with a bit of water.  Once I got past that it was a solid experience of hot cocoa with cinnamon, strong black coffee and a resiliant bitterness that punched through everything.  I cant say that I am a huge fan of the coffee stout style but this one is one of the best that I have had to date.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Le nez est torréfié et terreux : café brûlé, farine rôtie, mélasse, sésame grillé, argile. Le goût reprend les arômes, pas trop sucré ni trop amère : très bien équilibrée. Même si on parle en général de café, de moka et de chocolat, moi ce sont les arômes de terre qui me frappent et me séduisent particulièrement. Ça évoque le souvenir des ragoûts quont prépare avant Noël. La bouche est assez crémeuse et un peu poudreuse. La bière est bien pétillante, sans trop mousser. Jai été surpris de voire cette bière parmi les meilleures au Québec, devant la maudite, mais je comprend maintenant pourquoi.

Oh well, you gotta do what you gotta do...and I had to appreciate the beer. eaglefan538 hit the flavor on the head...a bit bitter and lactic tasting.

Aroma greatly improves as it warms, containing the same qualities just amplifying and improving each one.  Very nice aroma for a standard stout.  Taste is smooth, a little roasty and smoky with a considerable watery component.  Mouthfeel is silky yet still a little thin-bodied for my tastes.

Um, shit, thats diacytl.  Taste is charred and chocolate with a lot of coffee grains.  Up front it is pretty okay.  Just fades away ungracefully.  
Kind of thin and charred with diacytl.  Ill have to try this again. 6/3/7/3/13
-----
Re-rate 3/9/2007
Aroma is much more chocolate and coffee, mostly rich coffee with hints of a graininess.  Still, touches of diacetyl.
Taste is like coffee grounds that have been freshly ground to a powder then dissolved into a stout base.
I actually get a touch of alcohol in the aroma of this, but other than that, I think this beer is nearly perfect for what it is.  
Ill give it the benefit of the doubt, despite the smaller aroma.

455,"2008-01-08",4.1,"Wow!  That is a beer isnt it?  Dark dark dark brown to black with a healthy dark tan head, thinning quickly.  That thing smells like a stout too!  Roast so fresh that it is fruity.  Really, this is like that fruity acidity you get from a god coffee.  Creamy, strangle, despite smelling like a dark cup of coffee.  Decent sweetness, level.  The mouthfeel is really exceptional for a beer this low in alcohol and really balanced.  I mean, this thing is full and creamy, but it isnt going to get you quite so smashed.  Still, its not full of unfermented sugars.  Or maybe it is?  This roast is so intense it could stand up to any malt.  Again, theres a creamy flavor as well as that fruity acidity like in the nose.  Its even better here, in my humble opinion!    Cherry?  Lingering cherry to oaky finish.  This is just a wonderful little beer, Id drink this for sure if it were local and/or half as much.

Deep roasty flavor, espresso, and bitter dark chocolate.  It could use a little more compexity of flavor. It is sort of a one trick pony with the roasted bitterness. This has a big initial mouthfeel for 5%, but it is somewhat thin bodied for a stout and this became more noticable the more I drank. However, it is very flavorful and drinkable despite the roasted bitterness and dryness. It would be very easy to under rate this beer if comparing it to Oatmeal Stouts such as Southern Tier Oat or Founders Breakfast Stout, but keeping all things equal and not comparing Imperial level stouts to this, it is a solid brew.

First impressions, was a very creamy, thick stouts, with hints of coffee bean, chocolate, and a slightly bitter aftertaste of cinamon.  The only downside to this beer is that it takes quite a while to get through one pint, since there is so many favours.  This is not a beer that should be drunk fast, but on the other hand, if it is drunk too slowly, then it can sometimes be tedius to get through.

455,"2007-03-28",4.0,"Picked this up at random and I gotta say, im really friggin glad I did. Pours about as black as black can get, with a thin chocolate brown head that has good retention. The aroma is dark chocolate and coffee. The flavor was very balanced, with big notes of coffee, and unsweetend chocolate, and very subtle hints of vanilla on the finish. The body was kind of thin, but that is about the only thing I can complain about. All and all a top notch stout.","Guelph, CANADA","wilderthanyou"

A: pours a silky-looking, near jet black with an ample, frothy cream/tan head, beer leaves massive lacing all the way through. You know its going to be a good beer when you want to dive right in and take a bath in it!

S: Smells like fresh-baked oatmeal cookies and roasted maple syrup.

T/M: Whew! Just what I was hoping for from this beer...loads of ultra roasted bitterness that lingers forever and a day. Good bakers chocolate flavorings mixed with dark cocoa and burnt coffee. Delicious. Classic oatmeal stout mouthfeel, good carbonation and a slick, oily finish.

Coffee, chocolate, hops, malt barley, hickory and smooth vanilla finish.  Mouthfeel is velvety smooth / rich.

455,"2007-02-11",3.8,"12-oz, courtesy of Maria--thank you! This was probably the last stout of the night, and speculation ensued that taste buds may have been weakened by the evenings proceedings. But whats opened is opened, and should be rated for now. This is a lovely black beer with a thick creamy moussy tan head, just the classic picture of a stout. Big vinous dark fruited nose, with coffee and chocolate lingering in secondary roles. Forward attack, with big body, active carb, and some lively flavor: more of the lightly sweet fruitiness but this time playing second fiddle to the coffee and roast, along with sharply attenuated red wine grape that really ascends at the finish and leaves a clingy astringent dryness. Not very sessionable, but beautifully crafted and delicious.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

Its black.  The head is darker than most beers.  Sweet smell of caramel, expresso, and roasted malt.  Taste is not as sweet as expected.  The expresso is still present, and is joined by bittersweet dark chocolate.  Hops arrive at the end to give it a mostly nice finish; it also becomes a little vinegary at the end.

In the mouth its more of the same, starting sweet, but finishing dry and slightly bitter.  Unfortunately, as others have noted, the flavor sort of deserts the beer at the end, and it turns a little watery.  That it does is especially disappointing given how strong it started, both in aroma and in the mouth.  I was drinking it a month past the ""best before"" date, so maybe that has something to do with it.","Seattle, Washington, USA","acertain"

Im not turned off by this aroma but as it lasts all the glass down, it is enjoyable.  Nice creamy mouthfeel, full, with flavors that dont seem to match.  Chocolate, roast, and bitter,  but for all that build up, the flavor falls off.  Bitter finish the way bad diner coffee does.  Hmm, maybe not the best of bottles.

Light to medium bodied mouthfeel with a nice effervescence.  Lots of flavor packed into a relatively light bodied beer.  I love the subtle smoked character Im getting.  This beer has some niced chocolate, roasty, oatmeal, and even a touch of sour saltiness going on , which are fantasticly constructed and balanced, but are not powerful enough to blow me away.

Lots of molasses and some sour salty oat quality. Not sublte or particularly quiet. Somewhat evaporative. Roast graduates to some sour and salt.

Medium bodied stout that starts dry with intense roasted malt/coffee expresso/licorice flavors.  Increasing hop bitterness in the middle. Finished with lingering hop bitterness. Rough ragged end.  Intensely bitter stout that is on the thin and watery side.  Bitterness seemly increased with every sip.  Ugh. A tough stout to stomach.   Bad batch?","Libertyville, Illinois, USA","beervana"
455,"2006-08-22",3.5,"bottle: Pours a deep black with a frothy light brown head. Lots and lots of head I might add. Lots of flavours going on, but the coffee really overwhelms everything and leaves a really bitter tast at the back of the mouth. I couldnt drink more than two of these in one sitting. Not as drinkable as Guinness. Beamish - the best stout of all time - has complex oatmeal flavourings yet is balanced and drinkable. Dissapointing for a beer in the 100th percentile. Just OK in my books.","Boozetown, Ontario, CANADA","LordBeamish"
455,"2006-08-21",3.1,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2006 341 mL bottle.  Dark black colour with dark tan head which lasts a long time.  It tastes like it smells:  lots of coffee and chocolate flavour.  Excellent example of the deep folds of flavour a stout can have, but too much hype here for me.  The chocolate and roasted flavours leave it bitter and very dry, giving a large bite.  Could be smoother.  Youngs Double Choc Stout is richer and Beamish has just as complex a palate (though not nearly as strong & bold) and neither of these stouts flavours over-ride the finish, and both are smoother and more drinkable.  Just doesnt balance out in the taste, but still very flavourful.  Worth a try but I wont rush back.  You know, a chef could make a meal taste like garlic, basil or lemon but if it overwhelms the taste, the dish is a failure & I think the same is true for beer.  Art for arts sake means nothing.","London, Ontario, CANADA","KingofCastle"

455,"2006-08-17",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 10, 2008 Bottle during my Great Lakes region brew tour. B-L-A-C-K with a tall, tan head. The nose is of sweet, creamy chocolate, oats, bright coffee, milk, and almonds. Licorice, oats, raisins, and soft coffee are present in the mouth. This flirts with the definition of a sweet stout. This is mild throughout but still complex and extremely well balanced. Scarily drinkable stout, this.

bottle from Leaf & Ale. Pours black with ruby evident in the light. A tall khaki head forms and lasts for the entire leisurely drinking session. The aroma is mouthwatering. It’s amazing what this stout can achieve in its tastefulness. It’s not powerful to the nose, but distinct toasted oats, mocha, smoke, and coffee are all noted. The flavor is the same. Oh, but let’s not skip over the oh-so creamy palate. It covers the tongue and just begs to wash down the gullet. The beer isn’t very heavy, but more than adequate to quell the hunger for flavor. I get toasty oats, mocha, just a hint of meat, and toffee in the finish. The whole thing is scarily drinkable. This is one balanced and pleasing package. St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout is the definition of a session beer.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

This is how a beer should look after being poured--huge black body topped by a huge tan head that sits up there with no intentions of going anywhere anytime soon. The head leaves tons of lacing on the glass all the way down. The aroma is sweet chocolate. The taste is more coffee-like than chocolate I think.

The aroma was of dry dark cocoa and very light coffee. Flavor was a nice combination of roasted malts, dark cocoa and coffee with a dry roasted oatmeal finish. A bit acidic / lactic in the finish, somewhat bitter for a sweet stout (exactly what an oatmeal stout tends to be, though). Light hops in the finish to keep this ""sweet"" stout from running away with any sweet / malt absurdness (ie. definite bitter statement in the end). Light smoke aftertaste. Mouthfeel is thick but not syrup-like, somewhat dry. A nice beer, but probably not in my overall top 25 list.

The palate is excellent, but only at a reasonably warm temperature.

I expected a lot of this brew and it is definitely good but no top 50. Rerate: almost exactly 1 year later.  Same batch, best before Feb. 28, 07.  Cellared for half the time and closet stored for the other half.  Still a good looking beer with the blackest body and a medium tan head.  I would not call the thin anymore but more like light-medium.  The aroma and taste have changed a good bit.  The roastiness is still there with good sweetness in the taste.  But no there is this overarching perfume character running through both the aroma and taste.  At times it seems nice but then it gets annoying and almost seems like real perfume added to the beer.

Flavor has big notes of roastiness, mocha and a nice, burnt ash-y type of flavor. Next comes notes of coffee, dark chocolate and caramel. Moderately sweet and moderately bitter. Medium bodied with a smooth texture and subtle carbonation - a touch on the thin side. GREAT head retention and lacing left on the glass. Really good stuff.","Ashburn, Virginia, USA","jasonp"
455,"2006-03-04",4.6,"Bottled. All I can say is WOW!  This is one of the most complex tasting beers Ive had in a while.  It pours black with virtually no head.  If you hold it up to the light (besides almost looking like an eclipse) it looks a bit burgundy in colour.  The first sip is decieving.  After a few sips youre completely addicted as you start to taste some burnt malt, coffee with maybe a small hint of chocolate and vanilla.  It has a BRILLIANT finish leaving just the flavours in your mounth and not the bitterness.  Best of all after about 20 mins there seems to be no aftertaste at all.

I gave this beer a high rating largely because of the intoxicating aroma and wonderful appearence.  I would still drink my Guinness anyday but this is like the dessert, the ultimate bled of flavour.","Alberta, CANADA","XtraStout"

Beige head gives rise to an eerie fog of complex foam, foam that seems to rise from the netheregions and, like Jason Vorhees, dies a slooooow death.  Lace clings like a werewolfs claws into a hapless victims flesh.  Aroma is a pointy whiff of pipe smoke, with bits of vanilla flavored tobacco wafting in the air.  Flavor is a merlot mixed with chocolate, smoke, and plum.  Coffee beans seem to be clawing their way to the head of the table to feast on the delicate carcass before them.   Palate is a bit watery.

Middle is nicely smoothed out (oatmeal influence I assume) and the finish is dark bitter roasted espresso flavors. Im a little underwhelmed.

Going in with lower expectations this time may have helped, or sampling a few oatmeal stouts next to this may have helped reveal the beers qualities.  I was impressed with the flavors. Still a thin palate and all, but theres more here than I first thought. Flavor increases by 1 as does Overall. *****ORIGINAL RATING
Bottle courtesy of Duane. A very generous gift, particularly considering Im sure he could have acquired some good stuff for this in a trade. So many thanks to Duane for the opportunity. Concerning the beer, highly aromatic, a fine blend of chocolate and oatmeal, and undoubtedly one of the best noses around. The aroma had me very excited, but I was disappointed to find the beer not overwhelmingly complex nor as thick and creamy as one might come to expect from a Top50 beer. Notes of oatmeal and malted milk balls and coffee. Rating to style, this ranks among the best oatmeal stouts, and certainly one of the best beers in general under 6 ABV beers around. Rating to quality, its solid, but not particularly noteworthy. Good stuff, and many thanks again to Duane for sharing.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

The color is dark black, without so much as a hint of red, with a small, mocha colored head that collapses and leaves a foam trail on the glass. Aroma is very roasty with coffee, 70% chocolate, and aromatic hops. The initial taste is espresso with a shot of buttermilk. The taste is roasty, both sweet and mildly sour, cofee, bittersweet chocolate, with an enjoyable moderately bitter, citrusy? floral? hoppy finish. The mouthfeel is very full initially, but finishes nicely. It seems like a much bigger beer than it is. The combination of the roasty malt and the bitter hops really is perfect, certainly one of the best stouts. Very easy to drink.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Dark chocolate, espresso beans, mocha, and fresh oats blended for a phenomenal deep roasted nose.  Flavors of bitter dark chocolate, freshly-ground coffee, and just lots of black maltage... beautifully roasted and complex, especially considering the low ABV.

Milk chocolate brown topping of medium heft with lots of creamy bubbles that sits for length before fading to a thick skim always staying present. Lacing is etched strongly into the glass with a thin foamy sheeting.

Aroma is broad, bitterly sweet, dark, and deeply chocolatey with a nice iced coffee, fudgesicle scent and a balancing toasted oat backing.

Bring on the taste machine...wow, very nice structure with creamy dark chocolate, roasted bitterness that ensues to the finish. Lightly sweet with toasted oats and slivers of milk chocolate. Dryness is spectacularly displayed in the finish with a big cocoa powdering, coating the entire back end with late surge of spent coffee.

Feel is very well rounded and quite full from front to back. Smooth, creamy, densely ending with a proud showcase of drying stout characteristics that run the gambit of chocolate roasted bitterness and coffee.

455,"2005-10-31",4.2,"Pours with an incredibly frothy brown head that sits atop a deep black beer that has hints of dark brown to it.  Ah, the aroma is quite nice; it is a mix of espresso, French roast, dark malt, hints of chocolate.  The really nice thing about the aroma is that despite the incredible roasty, burnt nose there is no astringent burnt grain huskiness to the nose.  Ok, the aroma is quite heavenly, I never would have guessed how well integrated this roasted malt nose would be; the mix of dark chocolate and coffee is quite heavenly.

Does the taste live up to the heavenly nose?  It is on the light side of things, as the alcohol percentage suggests this is a fairly light beer on the tongue, it does not have the thick maltiness that one would find in an Imperial Stout that would have a nose like this beer does.  Having said that the heft of this beer perfectly lives up to the 5% alcohol.  This beer is an expressive mix of roasted barley, dark roast coffee, even espresso and a hint of dark chocolate.  This beer has just a bit of oatmeal character to it that adds a touch of oily rich body to the palate.  The beauty of this beer is that it combines the rich roast malt character of a beer far beyond this alcohol content yet still retains a balance that does not allow this ample roast character to overwhelm the this relatively low alcohol beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

SLight thickness rounded out by a tiny sandpaper like carbonation, and an overall uniquley stout smothness. Taste is amasing, domonant flavour is roasted barley, a healthy dose of  medium bitter hop, accented by espresso, bunt toffie, hit of sweet ness, anise, and toasted almond. Aftertaste is, yup, you guessed it, Fenominal. Bitter hop coats the palate, toasted walnut, with a final dry touch and a coffie air returning up the throat. This beer is amasing. This beer is amasing. This beer is amasing. This beer is amasing. This beer is amasing. This beer is amasing. This beer is amasing. This beer is amasing.  what else can be said. Oh yah, THIS BEER IS AMASING!!

Think one of Joey’s might have broken as the dark and sticky remainders were in the box along with the hilarious note from our lovely USPS saying it was illegal to ship beer as they then repackaged it and sent it to me.
THIS IS DAMN NEAR BOTTLED PERFECTION. Makes me eat every last dumbass word I ever (jokingly or not) muttered against the durn furners that reside above this blessed nation. There is something unfathomingly (is that a word?) simple about how this all just comes together with such ease as it rolls across the tongue. God, I can even taste it now and you know that’s the sign of a remarkable beer when it’s been months. It has everything that I would want and hope for in an oatmeal stout and stops immediately at poetry defined.

Sounds like normal stout stuff doesnt it?  But this isnt a normal stout.  It is of the highest standard.  The flavor is rich of chocolate and dark malt, perhaps some mild hops in there with some roasty bitterness.  The aftertaste lingers, and glass disappears far too quickly.

Totally opaque black with some dark ruby at clear parts of the glass.  Light brown fizzy and foamy head.  Grape and wine aroma with floral hops and fruity notes: apple, cherry, wood.  Also sweet molasses in the aroma.  The flavour begins with a gentle bitterness that yields to some fruit and then escalates to a robust molasses and roasted flavour.  Peach and celery notes and a bitterness that comes from both the hops and malts.  Chewy, full body with medium carbonation and a clean finish.  Excellent.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

455,"2005-05-02",3.1,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2006 Noticed that I had this rated much lower than others so I figured Id give it another go since the price for a single was right. Very nice looking beer. Dark brown/black w/ a huge brown head of mixed size bubbles that laves behind an absolute ton of lace. Nose is mostly roasted notes w/ an astringent pungency, some floral and berry notes and a brackish sea-water tinge (I find this often in stouts, actually).

Im leaving this filed in my ""beers I just dont get"" drawer. 

Original rating: I really dont see what makes this so special. Theres plenty of more common oatmeal stouts that are better. This one has a nice dark color with a white head.

455,"2005-04-09",3.9,"4/8/05.  Poured out of 12 oz. bottle, obtained in a trade with Rastacouere on RateBeer 2/5/05.  Dark brown, nearly black and mostly opaque with a foamy, rocky but pretty solid dark tan head.  Lacing is pretty good-- nicely prominent throughout the glass, but a bit broken and blotchy even from the start.  Soft, sweet roast and a touch of acidic espresso froth with spices (a dash of cinnamon or nutmeg on the froth?), a dark blanket of chocolate and a distinct, mouthwatering boldness I would mistake for something higher than 5%.  Flavor brings in some light nuttiness and a bit too much of that char acidity, still showcasing the coffee but losing the indications of a higher-alcohol beer.  Seems sort of like black malt mixed with water.  Finish is really good with a long-lasting, deeply satisfying roast, dry chocolate, and hints of black licorice and smoke.  Body is medium-thin, a bit watery (or milky, actually).  Flavor teeters a bit too close to a dirty water or stale coffee assault, but the finish makes up for it.  Somewhat chalky in its drying finish.  Still a very nice beer, very drinkable and deserving of its reputation.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

All in all, one of my favourite things in the whole world.

It looked as good as expected, tight tan head over black but not inky beer.  I tasted it.  I became disappointed.  Perhaps I should reevaluate my liking for the genre of oatmeal stout, if this is the best they get.  The armoa was underwhelming, but I could already sense the funky graininess to come.  Yes, I know oats are involved, but they totally masked the stout roastiness that I was expecting.  This was like an oatmeal porter, but with burnt oatmeal.  Once I got past the bad parts, the taste rounded into some subtle dark fruit, which Im sure I would have liked as one component among many enjoyable components.

The head is thick and sticky tan and lasts and laces all over the place.  The aromas are incredible coffee and cream notes with hazelnut syrup that remind me of my morning coffee at 7-11.  I love my morning coffee.  The flavor is almost all coffee with coffee notes and coffee touches.  Theres also some more hazelnut, truffle oil, chocolate coated coffee bean.

Good lacing throughout, and a remaining cream layer left after the head wafted away. The aroma is sweet and malty, chocolatey, coffee, overall very light and sweet even as it warmed. The body is medium to slightly coating thick, with active carbonation. Thick tongue coating chocolate, malt, toffee, and coffee. You can nearly TASTE the caffeine in this beer. I was nearly asleep before I opened this beer, but now Im nearly awake. Roasty coffee bean finish, fairly wet though for a stout. Wonderfully crafted sweet stout.

Very nice lacing for a stout!  slighlty sour flavors start but then are invaded with a dark chocolate mid palate fading into a long burnt finish.

Flavor is predominantly of coffee and chocolate, and the finish is wonderfully balanced--mildly bitter and not at all overdone.  Body is a bit on the thin side, though, but flavor, aroma, and appearance make up for it.  Overall, this is easily among the best beers I have ever had.

455,"2004-03-16",4.2,"A fine Canadian stout...probably the best available widely in bottles. I want to try this one on tap again soon...it's delicious!
Is also sold in the now standard brown Canuck long-neck twist off crown bottle (not a very fitting presentation for this fine stout). Had a ""best before code"" logged at 6 months from production date and there was nothing on the label to indicate it was preservative free with this lengthy shelf life although the web site says that they are ""naturally brewed"".

Poured a black opaque color that defies light to pass through the glass....a puffy mocha head stays quite a while then reduced to a brown lace half way through the drink. 

Smells of cooking coffee, spice and carmel. 

Starts fairly thick, rich and malty then builds to a well balanced, complex, full creamy body with accents of coffee, burnt toast and hoppy bitterness mingled with slight hints of fruit that vanish as the hop bitters take over in the finish...has a tart dryer finish that leaves a lingering metallic taste that is surprisingly not unpleasant to the palate.

Aroma has a lot of light coffee notes, notable dark chocolate, cream, dark cherries, light molasses, bit of ash and caramel.

A beautiful black, with a large, frothy, chocolate-tan head and nice lacing.  Aroma is malty sweet, roasted, tangy, frutiy berries, coffee, chocolate.  Mmm.  Tastes roasted choco-coffee, fresh, lightly citrusy hops, malty, finishes deliciously bitter and a little sour-sweet.  Feels pretty rich in the mouth, my only complaint in the palate-department is that sometimes it feels a bit too ""sharp"", but sip it, and let it settle in the glass a bit and it should be fine.  Very good.","Ontario, CANADA","icanrate"

The aroma is rich and malty, hints of coffee and chocolate with a good sweet malt backbone. A little bit of alcohol aroma can also be detected. The flavor is roasted malt that provides the initial bitterness then a little bit of hops. Coffee flavors dominate from about mid-swallow on. The body is full and creamy.

455,"2004-01-02",3.6,"This beer formed a small sized medium brown head with fine-medium sized bubbles that mostly dissipated. The body was opaque and uncarbonated with a black hue. The nose was lightly malty, chocolate and coffee. The flavor was that of chocolate notes and roasted coffee that left a slight aftertaste. The mouthfeel was smooth and the lacing was average. A little too much of a coffee taste for me.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
455,"2004-01-02",4.6,"This bottled brew from SlikWily poured a exquisitely fine large head (for a stout at least) of foamy fine to medium sized long lasting dark brown colored bubbles that left behind a be3autifl opaqu pitch black body with no visible carbonations and a good lace.

No bite at all.  Delectible flavors of dark malt, chocolate, mild vinuous notes, mollasses, sweet malt, oatmeal and a little soda pop thrown in for good measure!  An equisite stout.

455,"2003-12-23",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2006 2003 bottle consumed in December 2003.  Extremely deep black, nice finger and a half dark ruby brown head.  Moderate lacing.  Aroma is dark dark roast.  Heavy bitter coffee, some smoke?  Good bitter hops, and some tart prunes mayhaps.  Flavor gets a few extra points for originality.  Heavily roasty, not overly sweet at all.  Body is thick, oily, sticky.  Medium body, HIGHLY carbonated (too much so). Like theres some sour milk in there, but not in a bad way. . . Finish is pleasant and balanced, but a bit too lacking.  After I drank more and it warmed, I picked up a lovely smoked flavor, I think it was just the roasted oatmeal, but it was nice.  Needs more, though I love not overtop beers, so maybe this is quite nice. . .hmm, shall rerate soon from the other bottles I am cellaring.  Filtered unfortunately.  Thank you, Oakes, for sendin these my way!2005 bottle  Fresh.  And freshness is the key, as it is with all McAuslan beers (except the vintages).  The beer is one of the foremost accomplishments in brewing today of the example of rich, full flavor without being overdone or full of alcohol.  Chocolatey, creamy, hearty, but yet supremely drinkable.  Even the filtration and artificial carbonation dont seem to hinder the texture when fresh.  Lightly creamy, plenty of vanilla and moderate roast.  Score is for a fresh bottle, as that is how it should be consumed.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
455,"2003-12-22",3.8,"Definite roasted malt aroma - coffee and chocolate are subtle but present. Appearance is dark dark brown with minimal head. Flavor is masked by carbonation up front but is milky and slightly coffee-like in the finish. Mouthfeel is strange due to the initial carbonation. An OK stout but not the best!","Orland Park, Illinois, USA","lemonlovr"
455,"2003-12-17",3.8,"Huge thanks go out to Rastacouere for helping me out with my first International Canadian trade!
 Well, Appearance certainly rates in with a 5. Pours an opaque jet-black body and gathers a massive toffee colored head and mocha globs of lacing. The aroma is a cauldron of coffee and mocha, a rich Belgian chocolate. I take a sip from the snifter, Damn!!! The chocolate malts are far more roasted and charred than I was expecting! Very modest note of the Oatmeal grain, but overcome with smoky dark oak notes. 
 The mouth feel is a bit thin, a creamier texture would have scored more points wit me, Overall this is a very tasty beer, maybe a little overrated by my personal standards but I do recommend seeking some out so you can make a judgment of your own! 
 Thanks Dave, You Rock!!!

Satisfying chocolate and liquorice flavours, though not as complex as the aroma hinted. Dry finish was a little too short for something with such great flavours. Thanks Josh for this fine example and many more.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Linc"
455,"2003-05-22",3.8,"Guinness should take lessons from these guys. This is the real deal, pitch black, with complex flavours of espresso coffee, liquorice, and dark fruit combine with a well-hopped bitterness.

Has a great roasted chocolate smell with some hints of mocha, or something like that and it even seems to have somewhat of a rye smell in the background.  Seems to have some jim beam flavors in it to add to the thick malty chocolate coffee taste. An impressive beer to say the least.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","21iceman40"

Not overly sweet IMO but fairly dry, layers of coffee and backers chocolate in the mouth with some lacotos tartness and a dry coffee finish.  Prehaps another bottle will prove otherwise but I found this one nice but overhyped.","Yokosuka, JAPAN","Marc"
455,"2003-03-07",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2003 Black with the slightest ruby edge. Nice brown head and lace. Fantastic aroma of roasted grains, chocolate, flaked barley, coffee, vanilla and others. Medium-thin bodied, smooth, tons of of black malt character, huge coffee bitterness that gives way (only for a second) to subtle oaty sweetness. The roasted/bitter coffee finish does not end and meshes with the hops perfectly. Very addicting brew that could use a bit more body IMHO but makes up for it in depth of flavor.

The aroma is full of oatmeal at first and then moves to coffee, chocolate and roasted nuts.  Flavour is astonishing as it tastes like semi-sweet chocolate, rolled oats and coffee.

Oily on the tongue.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

The nose is full of intense roastiness with buttery notes, ink, plums, cardboard, and chocolate.    Silky, oily in feel with some sharp spritz.  A myriad of flavors from beginning to end:  intense coffee middle increases to the finish, alongside coconut, raisin, and flaky roasted barley.  The finish shows a sufficient amount of oatmeal goodness, which I always seek in the style but never find,  with a complex mix of  mocha, caramel, lactose, and drying hints of charcoal dryness.  Runs neck and neck with El Toro and Samuel Smiths.  A real beauty.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
455,"2003-01-28",4.4,"Awesome stout. After pouring into a pilsner glass, I couldn't even get a flashlight to penetrate the super black liquid. It's that dark with bold, complex, and challenging flavors. Chicory and coffee kept repeating in my mind, but I think it's a little dry to be called a sweet stout.

455,"2003-01-06",4.0,"This beer rocks!
The aroma holds huge notes of milk chocolate and hickory smoke with lesser notes of vanilla, dark coffee, cinnamon and toasted nuts.
This stout pours thick and black. Even when held up to extremely bright light, this beer is black, black, black! A lazer beam shot from the head of a ""frickin shark"" couldnt pass through this glass of liquid fudge. Large, rocky, deeply tanned head. Mostly diminishing with excellent lacing.
The flavor is extremely well balanced. Bursts of smoke, espresso and dark chocolate up front. Excellent blend of acidity, mild bitterness and a light tartness on the backside. Just a hint of vanilla on the tongue.
Medium-bodied with a watery mouthfeel. Fizzy carbonation and a short crisp, clean, dry finish.

455,"2002-10-23",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 16, 2003 Bottled -- Rich, highly roasted malt aroma, some dark coffee, molasses, semi-sweet chocolate and a very faint vinous quality.  Deep, opaque black color, with a foamy, rocky light brown head, subsiding and some extremely delicate lacing.  Thick, malty, dark, roasty flavor profile, some toffeeish sweetness, bitter coffee, dark chocolate, hazelnut and just a hint of fruity plum and earthiness.  Medium-full body and thick, coating texture.  Some light acidity and moderate roasty bitterness on the finish.  Very flavorful and satisfying rendition, quite nice.  


Original rating, draught -- Standard nitro stout head, which is to say unnaturally thick and small bubbled, medium dun in color.  Thick-looking dark black-brown in color.  Slightly malty aroma, nitrogen is definitely apparent and seems to leave something of it's own mark to the detriment of the rest of the aroma.  Super creamy beer.  Oatmeal gives a very Samuel Smith-ian character to this one, flavor-wise.  No tingle or real bitterness on the palate, and with a medium body.  Rich, roasted oat taste, with some fruit, perhaps currant?  Just so roasty!  Some bready malt and light cocoa.  Tastes pretty good but nitro ruins the palate and a few other things about the beer.  I have a feeling I would have liked the bottled version much better, but I didn't see the tap spigot before I ordered it.  5/4/8/3/15 - 3.5","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

455,"2002-05-23",4.1,"I generally dont like a lot of oatmeal stouts as they tend to taste too much like breakfast for me.  This one was a pleasant surprise though.  Nice chocalate and strong coffee malt flavors with a good roasted malt to balance them out a bit.  Definately worth having more of.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","SJP"

455,"2002-05-09",4.4,"Thanks to DougShoemaker for this one! Outstanding Stout, although I still like Sam Smiths a little more. My only negative comment about this one is that the alcohol flavor was not hidden as well as it could have been (or do we call that bitterness?). Roased aroma and nice coffee flavoring. Almost black with great lacing. I am going to try to hunt this one down again sometime.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

455,"2002-04-03",4.3,"Killer oatmeal stout.  Incredible aroma of chocolate, toffee, coffee and maybe a little licorice?  Pours black with a thick brown head. Flavors similar to that noticed in aroma, with a nice hop finish. Medium body with moderate carbonation.  Just about perfect on the palate.  Similar to the Wild Goose Oatmeal Stout I recently tried, but hoppier and not quite as sweet.  This is becoming one of my favorite styles.

Disappointingly thin without strong flavours or scents, except a strange aftertaste ... kind of like a slightly sweeter Guiness. Not my fave oatmeal by a longshot, but the bottled version is better by far.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","shintriad"
455,"2002-02-24",4.7,"Dark as night, with a creamy brown head. Smooth chewy hints of chocolate, fantastic. I was beginning to think Canada didnt know what good beer was until I had this one. This is the best beer Ive ever come across!!","Seattle, Washington, USA","Davhgbrew"

455,"2001-12-08",4.0,"Rocky brown head that erupts when first poured, but quickly settles to a nice lacing.

455,"2001-08-19",4.1,"While I prefer the rich body and creamy head that Samuel Smiths OS offers, St. Ambroise is blissfully bitter on account of its more pronounced hoppiness.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Soothsayer99"

Actually better from the bottle than on tap, at least in this town.

Apr 03:  no longer available in Vermont, I had to get this from my neighbor to the North (thanks MartinT).  Wow what a gorgeous glas of beer, opaque and with a head you think you could take a nap on.  I appreciate the strong roastiness much more now; this is truly a world-class stout.

Aroma is strong, but not overpowering; and the flavor is slightly sweet, which just enhances this beer.","Decatur, Georgia, USA","wade"
