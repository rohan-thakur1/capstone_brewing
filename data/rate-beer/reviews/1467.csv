1467,"2015-11-18",4.3,"On tap this was beyond amazing. In bottle the appearance and palate are not as not worthy. 

Still an amazing beer however. And really a true imperial porter. Several are selling high gravity beers as porters... cant say I agree or get this. I would say this is the best imperial porter out there. 

Vanilla toffee, with an end of oak. Down right awesome flavor. Aroma has some alchol.and other flavors. GREAT BEER still!","Taft, Tennessee, USA","Itzjerm"
1467,"2015-09-22",4.2,"Bottle from the source. Served at room temperature into my snifter.
Very dark brown pour with reddish tints. A beige head leaves a lot of
spotty lacing. Aroma has chocolate and espresso, with a solid vanilla presence. One part to one part to ... Very nice, beyond possibly being not as strong as one would prefer. Taste is of big bakers chocolate, green coffee beans and sweet bourbon. And, down in the glass, a touch of caramel with a lot more sweet bourbon. Medium-to-full bodied with some alcohol. Not sure if the presence is as much assumed from the flavor or actually kicking in. Finishes long and bourbony sweet, with some bitterness back from the choco/coffee. But vanilla-led. This has some rawness to it. Certainly a white whale, so quite excited. Will age some and retry in a while. Some have compared to KBS - not sure, may have to do a vertical. 16.2","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"

1467,"2014-01-30",3.5,"25-Jul-11 (12-oz bottle, Bottled 10-Mar-06: Obtained 01-May-06 in trade with hopdog, thanks Steve!)Well, after aging a bottle with a screw-off cap for five years, its no surprise to me that the carbonation is very low; no sound is emitted when the cap is removed. As expected, the clear, dark-brown beer pours with no head. The nose offers chocolate, coffee, prune, wood and a light bourbon note. In the flavor, lots of sweet chocolate bar, cocoa, prunes, coffee, and molasses. The bourbon barrel aging is apparent, but not dominating, with flavors of wood, vanilla, coconut, and a touch of bourbon in the finish. On the palate, its medium in weight, somewhat dry in the finish, and low in carbonation. Overall, this is quite solid. Aging a beer for five years may be too long to some people, but this beer has held up wonderfully.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

1467,"2013-07-07",3.3,"12oz bottle from Todd. Thanks! 

A: Dark mahogany pour with a very thin ring of light mocha colored head. A decent amount of legs on this one. 

N: A very intense espresso rises up from the nose. Theres some vanilla, and caramel, but its more roasted coffee. Chocolate underpins this, and theres some blackberry and cherry, but its not a rich bouquet of smells. 

T: Sweet and roasty with a slight bitterness. Theres a slight oaken sourness (not infected, just that kind of sharpness). Bourbon runs through this, but its missing an extra dimension. 

M: On the lighter side given how big it is. Still a medium bodied beer, but I expect a more burly malt character to slosh around on the tongue.

O: A solid beer, and Im glad to have tried it. Works well as a day to day drinker, but Id appreciate more dimension throughout because it seems more like a porter and a half than an imperial porter.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

1467,"2013-02-24",4.1,"Aroma is mostly dark roasted malt - coffee and a faint roasted meat note. There is a hint of dark chocolate as well. After the malt fades you pick up the barrel character with some vanilla and nuts as well as a slight oak note. 
Pours black with dark brown highlights on the edges. Just a thin light brown head that quickly recedes to the edges where it lingers. No lacing and medium sized legs. 
Flavor starts out with sweet chocolate and toffee then the coffee shows up adding a mocha like character. There is a light dark fruit note in the finish but then the barrels character sets in. The finish has bourbon along with vanilla, coconut and nuts. There is a slight oak note as well. The alcohol in the finish is nice and clean. The bitterness is fairly low in relation to the malt notes. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium low carbonation. The astringency is low but present and the alcohol warmth is moderate. 
Overall this is a really nice porter that has integrated nicely with the bourbon barrel characteristics. The alcohol isn't too hot and the barrel shows through more than the bourbon. Very enjoyable beer.

<b>The look: </b>Very dark brown (almost black) body topped by a very small tan head.
<b>In long: </b>The lightly roasted nose has some bourbon barrel along with the usual vanilla side-kick.  Body is full and the soft carbonation gives it a creamy/viscous sensation.  The main flavours are lots of toffee, milk chocolate, bitter black chocolate, some vanilla and some bourbon (less bourbon than expected).  Almost nothing in the way of fruity flavours.

1467,"2007-08-31",4.0,"Aroma of oats, chocolate, a touch of bourbon and a tiny bit of oxidation that smells a bit like minerals.  Dark brown in color, pretty much black.  Flavor is really good, I taste coffee, chocolate, touch of oak and bourbon, vanilla, some rich molasses and some type of spice in the fairly dry finish.  Texture is excellent, super soft and creamy, it coats the mouth without being overly sweet like many imperials. Oak and bourbon are very subtle. This is excellent.  They should brew this again.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"
1467,"2007-08-18",4.7,"Pours out black with a light tan head that retains decent and leaves some lacing as well. Smell is outstanding; chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, French roast coffee, and a little molasses. Taste opens with some vanilla that leads right into some chocolate, toffee, and coffee notes. Its not done there though, there is also some oak and bourbon as well as vanilla. Both smell and taste are 6 out of 5, just amazing. Lower carbonation and full bodied makes this an excellent sipper. I could sip on one of these every night, I just wish I had another so I could enjoy this masterpiece again.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

Tasty!","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
1467,"2007-06-15",3.8,"Modest retention of a dark tan head, eventually fully receding. The black body looks weighty. The timid aroma is comprised of chocolate, whiskey, vanilla, licorice, roasted malts and a faint hint of espresso. The flavor is nearly identical, with a pleasant addition of soft fruity hops and a whisper of earthiness. Sweetness is light to moderate, bitterness is the same. Alcohol is well masked throughout. The finish is smooth and creamy, leaving behind hints of chocolate cake icing and orangey hops. Mouthfeel is thinned from the time in the barrel, but not thin overall. Medium bodied, lightly carbonated. Very tasty, but it isnt the knockout I had expected.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

1467,"2007-06-13",4.6,"Appearance: Pours a nearly opaque, near-black body with a thin, khaki-colored head.

Smell: An unmistakably bourbon-esque aroma, with full notes of vanilla, burnt toffee, brown sugar, and smoke.

Taste: Rich, velvety chocolate taste combined with vanilla beans and the smooth, subtle taste of bourbon. Lesser hints of coffee and anise. Finishes with a bit more bourbon and a light roastiness.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, with a perfectly smooth, creamy mouthfeel. Low carbonation.

Drinkability: Its a treat to finally come across a beer that didnt allow the bourbon barrel-aging to totally crush the load-bearing malt flavors underneath.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

1467,"2007-05-11",4.2,"Opaque black. Smell is rich malty sweetness that includes vanilla tones, roastiness and bourbon. Just a hint of a dairy-like porter smell from the roasted malt. Bourbon and vanilla come thru in the taste along with a nice roasted flavor and some cola-like sweetness. The smell is very inviting and the roasty and sweet flavors balance each other nicely. I can feel the alcohol strength but it is very well hidden in the taste and smell, not sure if the bourbon scents cover it, but it is well balanced. Creamy medium body, this beer really hit the spot.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","hoppymeal"

Almost a touch of chocolate covered salty pretzel lingers intriguingly as well.  Medium bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel.  Loads of white chocolate and vanilla wash pleasingly over the palate.

1467,"2007-01-27",4.3,"Brewblackhole told me he wouldnt be able to get this for me and then upon opening my package there it was, staring me in the face. So many thanks. Ok, this was an incredible porter, reminded me of an impy stout in a way. The color is deeper and blacker than most porters and has an almost non existent brown head. The aroma was incredibly dense. Wow, sooo much going on. Bourbon is the definite powerhouse here, but it gives way to alcohol, sweet chocolate and molasses, vanilla, and roasted coffee. Absolutely wonderful. Man alive, tastes as good as it smells. Again strong bourbon taste, very whiskeyish, oak, vanilla, chocolate, roasted coffee, and alcohol. Simply amazing. The palate was a step down from its sensory attributes but still nice, needs to be fuller and thicker. The finish is warm and dry, feels like bourbon gone down neat. Probably one of my favorite beers of all time and Im sad that it was a limited release.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
1467,"2007-01-27",4.3,"Aquired the trade with brewblackhole.  I cant believe that this is a porter.  The color was deep chocolate/black.  The head was medium brown, but barely there.  The bourbon smell was very distinguishable in the aroma.  There was alcohol, molasses, chocolate, and oak smells as well.  The flavor was bourbon, alcohol, caramel, chocolate.  The flavor peaked after the initial bourbon taste.  The palate had a kick to it and the finish was warm.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","aubreya"

1467,"2006-12-07",4.1,"12 oz bottle, via JCapriotti.  Pours a very dark brown colored body under a small tight bubbled brown head that fell to a thin creamy film.  Aroma is caramel, roast, chocolate, light alcohol, some coffee, and moderate bourbon.  Flavor is quite unusual, theres alot of caramel with the usual chocolate battleing for supremacy over the vanilla and light bourbon notes.  I really like the interplay between the two.  A great balance has been struck here, just the right amount of bourbon barrel influence.  The vanilla goes great with the caramel.  Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a slightly oily texture and great soft carbonation.  Very mouthcoating, leaving a finish that lingers quite long.  I really liked this beer.  Great balance with the barrel influence, and very well hidden alcohol makes this extremely drinkable.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

1467,"2006-08-06",3.8,"Bottle purchased at Rileys, into Olympia stemmed glass.  Opaque warm brown with a smallish but dense tan head.  No lacing to speak of, but racing is deep and dense.  The head revives easily when the glass is swirled.  Smells like brown sugar and bourbon, but the latter is not too dominant since its balanced by aromas of cherry and bakers chocolate.  Creamy thick in the mouth, and syrupy coating in the finish, this beer is more about texture than flavor.  Flavors are most intense in the finish, where the hops are tangy and balance a completely unsweetened bakers chocolate.  Despite syrupy texture, this is never cloying, and manages to achieve dryness late in the finish.  Bourbon increases its presence as the beer warms.  Solid.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

1467,"2006-07-18",2.6,"Chestnut black. Uneven-edged ring of fluffy beige foam. Cola, vanilla taffy and chocolate fudge comprise a large portion of the nose. Faint toasted wood, unripe plums, and bourbon. Prickly carbonation tickles the palate. Pungent roast dominates the initial flavor before morphing into a brisk wall of char. Velvety chocolate fails to take foothold due to the fuzzy carbonation. Yeast and soggy grains muddle the flavor significantly. Some of the bodys girth drops off as it takes on a lightly vegetal flavor. Unripe plum acidity lessens much of the richness, though a fluffy nougat note persists. Alcohol lends dryness, but is well masked. Despite the abundance of  char, wet grains find their way into the finish and taint much of the more-pronounced malt elements. It takes so much more than simply tossing a beer in a bourbon barrel to achieve greatness. Key flaw here is the carbonation, which is far too hard, loose, and fuzzy for my liking. On top of that,  theyve chosen to strip the soul from the beer by filtering it to death. Yes the aroma is okay (obligatory vanilla, wood, and chocolate are all  present), but the base beer doesnt offer anything overly enticing. Just not a whole lot here to hold my interest.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

I finally had my one bottle after this disappeared from the shelves.  Its   too bad really because as it turns out I loved the way this one was made.   Hopefully Tyrenana will make it again at some point.

Aroma / Appearance - Deep black in appearance with a thin oily tan   head.  A creamy mixture of vanilla, bourbon, malt, coffee and cherries   greeted my senses with a subtle mixture of hazel in the background.  It was   very inviting; I could have sat there all night soaking in the rich scents.

Flavor / Palate - A full creamy mouthfeel dense with flavors hit my   senses from the second that the liquid passed through my lips.  Along with   a tinge of bitterness I was able to pick up a smooth combination of malts and   hops.  The bourbon was well balanced; it did not overwhelm my tastebuds at   any point.  I was able to pick up coffee, black cherries, hazelnut, caramel,   toffee and a fleeting woody taste.  Every sip was well balanced - at no point   did it merge into something other than a sublime experience.  Even the finish   was dry and creamy, leaving me wishing I had another bottle.  Snap this up if   you find it - you wont be disappointed!","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

There was no head on top of this thing and it really was basically midnight oil black. The two over powering things in this beer were the bourbon and toasted malts. If you look closely, rather taste closely, there is vanilla, roast, wood, alcohol, some grilled meatyness, and a bit of fruit. This is full of flavour, creamy, filling, and at the same time it has the ability of drying the palate and begging you to have more.

Deep black in color with a two finger thick head that is constant as the northern star. Rich coffe and chocolate in the fore followed by a LOT of vanilla and an almost Frangelico like liquor flavor.

1467,"2006-04-09",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 18, 2006 12oz bottle.One of the best applications yet of the bourbon barrel-aging process. Not as subtle as their Rockys Revenge Bourbon-Barrel Brown (in which they only barrel-age a portion of the stock), but still very well-integrated flavors. (On this point I strenuously disagree with a number of reviewers who feel the bourbon-barrelization overshadowed all else.) Aroma is slightly vegetal -- the only knock I can think of for this beer -- but this subsides as it warms. Other aromatic characteristcs are the molasses, maple, hazelnut, toasted grain, vanilla; sniffing this beer is almost like walking into a gourmet coffee shop. Bourbon-barrel-aged characteristics are prominent, adding molasses, oak, vanilla and a mercifully judicious bit of bourbon. However, the porter base is not at all lost, contributing its own smokey, caramel, toffee, toasted grain, chocolate and nutty elements. Full-bodied, velvety-smooth creamy palate. As with their less bold but still intriguing Rockys Revenge, this is bourbon-barrelization done right. Seven bucks for a 4-pack of this?? Youve gotta be kidding. Only in Wisconsin do they brew stuff this good for this cheap.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"
1467,"2006-04-07",3.0,"UPDATED: FEB 13, 2007 Bonus bottle! from StewardofGondor consumed with OldGrowth on 4/6/06Head sticks around for a minute or two and then fades to partial cover and eventually a ring.  Burnt sienna in color, atop a deep crimson, transluscent (at first) body, that settles out with transparent clarity.  Light, spotty lacing left behind.Aroma is heavy on the barrel, at first.  Dry wood tannins pile in, with tons of coconuty-bourbon notes.  Faint note of alcohol at first, fully passing.  Quite dry and tannic, but as it breathes, fudgy cake emerges rather triumphantly, adding some depth.  Alcohol passes, as said, while the tannins lay off.  Behind them, however, is only light fudge and chocolate.  Thats really the extent of the malt depth.  Though, near the end of the glass, after fully warming, I am getting a smoky, charred wood note from the barrel.  No roasted malt, not really any crunchy, earthy barley.  And even more lacking are the fruits.  Almost zero fruitiness.  No hops, no yeast.Flavor is woody, dry, moderately tannic but sweetens considerably towards the end.  More German chocolate cake.  Very Zywiec-like, actually.  Would almost think this a Baltic porter minus the roast (though Zywiec is very light on roast too).  But it dosent have an ale yeast fruitiness to it, though I imagine it is an ale yeast.  Some dark plums are about the extent of that.  Coconuts on the end, accentuate the barrel character and dont really bother the malts.  The texture is lightly chewy, sort of in between on filtration.  Not too heavy, but could be less.  Malts evolve, somewhat, with graham crackers, adding a crusty, lasting quality.  Dry tannins definitely hold back the sweetness and alcohol is well concealed (I hate it when alcohol is used to balance).  Ends with simple chocolate and easygoing barrel character.  Low carbonation.  A simple man, with simple pursuits.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Oh yeah... and the bourbon is everywhere... unfortunately masking some of the underlying beery goodness that I believe is there.  Palate is a tad less than medium-bodied, with an interesting sweet/sour dichotomy stemming from the roasted dark malts and bright bourbon highlights throughout.  Finish is tacky and roasty.

1467,"2006-03-28",3.0,"Sampled with frankenkitty at a very mini-The LoSBD meeting:  I have to give this a cautioned recommended rating.  Theres obviously a rich malty porter beneath this, but its one of those instances when the barrel aging takes over the drink.  A strong, sweet Bourbon aroma, reminiscent of past bouts with Southern Comfort, dominates the nose, some milk chocolate managing to seep through it all.  The flavor is a tad more complex, adding a bit of oaken woodiness, a drop or two of vanilla, and a trace of nutty bitterness.  The finish returns to the sweet Bourbon.

1467,"2006-03-26",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2006 Re-rate has turned (the bottom) into a great beer. Truly remarkable. When drinking this 2 other people commented ""thats the greatest thing Ive ever tasted"". While that might be a drunken exageration, it is damn good. Age has treated this one well.

Pours a pitch black color, no light gettitn through this one. Almost no light brown head. The bourbon is light on the aroma. Though thats about it as far as whats goin up the schnozz. A little coffee, roasted flavors. And now we drink..  sour, bitter, not much body. Second sip has a little more body, rounded out chocolate flavors, but still the sourness.... bourbon bite sourness... strong and overbearing.","Mississippi, USA","Mangino"
1467,"2006-03-26",4.2,"12oz bottle via trades with DavidP and Duane!  - Thanks to you both!  - Pours black with a nice tan head that settles back to a film quickly but laces in patterns from then on down.  Aromas of bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, and roasted malts.  Flavor is a great chocolate, caramel, roasted malt base that is embellished by beautiful subtle bourbon flavor, vanilla, and oak.  Nothing overpowering just a smooth drinkable porter with so much nice flavor taken from the barrel that makes this a great beer.  Palate is smooth and melts in your mouth like a kraft caramel.  Oh this one belongs in the top 50..","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"
1467,"2006-03-26",5.0,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2007 it poured out a nice dark, rich color.  The smell of bourbon with a touch of chocolate.  Had it sit out for about a half hour.  Why you ask?  So I could enjoy the wonderful taste of bourbon heaven.  This is my second time I am drinking this and its even beter than the first.  I am glad I bought a case of this fine beer.  I cant wait to try the other 3 beers from Tyranenas series of big, bold, ballsy beers.  Great job brewing this wonderful imperal poter.  Had it again and just gets better. The longer you leave it out, the better it gets.You get all the aroma out there.  Coffee, chocolate and the bourbon.  What a combo.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","KingpinIPA"
1467,"2006-03-22",4.3,"Deep dark black body, from which no light can escape (like sating into my soul).  Wonderful mild chocolately aroma.  Has an excellent roasty and sweet chocolate flavor.  Also has a good body and carbonation.  Overall, this is very good,  A real treat.","Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, USA","LePoopie"
1467,"2006-03-22",4.2,"Bottled on the 03/10/2006.  Pours to a deep brown head atop a very dark brown/blackish body.  Nice lacing.  The aroma is semi-sweet chocolate chips, cookie dough, vanilla, blondies (the blond-colored brownies).  The flavor is a blondie, charred oak barrel, vanilla, and something that comes off as a light strawberry.  Quite good.  The palate is very rich and creamy, a touch hot.  Leaves a lot of tingling on the tongue.  Good mouthfeel, however.  A damned good porter.  I think its about 10% ABV.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
1467,"2006-03-20",4.1,"Dark dark brown body; thin frothy tan head that fades to a lovely tan ring.
Aroma is hard to find... roasty grain with some roasted vanilla bourbon (like burnt vanilla bean). 
Bourbon gently graces dark licorice with vanilla... tart fruit... I think I can taste some charred oak barrel. Its hard to find the porter though. And... Imperial Porter? Not to nitpick on the style.... but basically, its a nice, well crafted BA beer. Perfectly aged.
To be continued...","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
1467,"2006-03-18",3.8,"Near black with a tall bubbly tan head.  For me a rather light aroma. Pale malt and a only a hint of something bigger. Not depth in the scent. Im not doing a side by side, but I just finished the Founders Kentucky, so there are many similarities in flavor. Light vanilla bourbon in the front again. More pale malt flavors present and in some ways just as good. A mild bourbon presence through the finish and linger. Fairly full, and only lightly silky. Only a touch of black malt acidity. A brew that is more suited to having one or two after a rough day, rather than one to end the day with.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1467,"2006-03-15",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2006 Bottle.  Black body under a short but creamy dark tan head - good soapy lacing.  Sweet vanilla aroma along with some buttery brownie, light bourbon, and light black roast- fantastic!  OMG the flavor - this came from Lake Mills???  I dont even stop there for gas.  A bit of tart raspberry kicks off the flavor but its quickly overpowered by vanilla blended with bourbon-soaked brownies.  The finish has chocolate combined with dry oak and a toasted nuts.  Lingering roast  acidity.  Thick, smooth mouthfeel.  Great beer here - a sweet choclate and vanilla with a pleasant bourbon addition.  Reminds me of the 1st batch of Central Waters Bourbon Barrel Stout.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
1467,"2006-03-15",4.7,"Pours a thick,extremely dark color with a tiny tan head.This porter has a wonderful chocolate malt aroma,followed by hint of vannila.Then comes the distinct,but subtle bourbon overtone.Upon first sip,wow!silky smooth velvet-like chocolate/coffee/vanilla flavor that rolls off your tounge,followed by that bourbon overtone.Im not a huge bourbon aged fan,but this brew is wonderful! KUDOS to my favorite brewery!","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","LtJudge"
1467,"2006-03-14",4.4,"Medium viscosity, opaque and impenetrable black in color with a thick tan film of scattered sawdust as the head.  Fudge brownies with caramel ripples kick things off, followed by subdued vanilla and a mild smooth, oaken aroma.  Semi-sweet chocolate morsels and milky iced mochas promulgate a bourbon accent that - aromatically speaking - only excretes its character spawns (vanilla, caramel, oak, burnt matter, etc.)  That being said, the bourbon intercedes more in the flavor department.  Tasty bourbon, vanilla and caramel compose a triumvirate of flavorful affection.  Rich, sweet maple and brown sugar balance the bourbon backbone beautifully.  Caramel-infused Tollhouse cookies at the point in their life cycle of being pulled out of the oven two minutes too soon  its that simultaneous feeling of sneaking said cookie off the cookie sheet and devilishly reveling in the sweet gooey glory.  Milky chocolate with a dabble of Frangelico liqueur furthers the complex anthem.  Fuller-bodied with a touch of bitterness that helps to engrain its porterly intensions.  Just plain good in the limelight.  The brewerys attempt to lower the carbonation of this bottled version should be lauded, applauded and mimicked.  Black malts, flame licked oak, dark chocolate and Godiva liqueur leave a tasty finish.  Im so happily bemused and excited for Tyranena to get the recognition that they deserve.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
1467,"2006-03-11",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 15, 2006 The first of Tyranenas big series brews and this one is going to be hard to top. Rich full roasted coffee chocolate vanilla,and a smidget of the bourbonin the aroma. Apperance is scary,almost gothicly scary.As black and dark as can be,darker than a Guinness. The first taste is a stew of coffee chocolatecarmel a hint of anise,and the far away call of the bourbon barrel. The silky mouthfeel melts your senses with its velvety smoothness. you swallow,everything eases down your throat,and then bam,there it is the succulent sweet smooth taste of bourbon. that rich taste of bourbon just improves and becomes more tantalizing as this brew warms. This beer definitely has to be out of the fridge a good half hour beore opening. A first class effort. Imay go back and rate this even higher after my second or third bottle. Price is way to low,good for us.","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"
