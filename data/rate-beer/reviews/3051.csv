3051,"2017-05-25",3.9,"Bottle at Pers Almost gone tasting, March 2017. Dark mahogany with a light brown head that mostly fades to a thin ring. Really nice interaction between all the ingredients with a light peat, oak, bourbon, vanilla, smoky malts, maple sap, light molasses, toffee, boozy, full body that is lovely to sip and let develop. Mild carbonation, lots going on here, little too sweet but things seems to cut it somewhat.","Ottawa, CANADA","pushkinwow"
3051,"2017-03-31",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Deep raisiny caramel malts leap from the Barrel-Aged Barley Wine, drawing instant sherry connotations onto a quickly seduced palate.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam crowns the purplish brown.
-Alcohol warmth is present throughout.
-Mouthfeel is luxurious, even with the very low carbonation.
-Maple smoke is subtle, but adds even more depth.
-This is a mesmerizing sipper for malt and barrel-aging lovers.

Smokier than I remember the base beer being when it was fresh (though I just had the draught version). Smoke and muddled malt, with a prevelant alcohol taste and nose. Still good, but likely past its prime.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

3051,"2015-12-14",4.0,"750 ml bottle ordered from the brewery and picked up in February 2013, now aged for almost three years ($30.00). Pours a deep reddish mahogany hue with one finger of fizzing cola-like beige foam that quickly recedes. Rich AROMA of dark chocolate, bourbon, still a bit of smoke, sweet maple-glazed caramels, and some booze. Glad that I opened this in mid-December as it the nose does really remind me of Christmas. FLAVOR of overly sweet toffee, boozy bourbon, maple syrup, honey / thick mead, dark sticky candied fruit, and a hint of smoky malts. Finishes sweet and with a booziness that is actually pretty nice. As with the original non-BA version, this is really sweet and comes to close to cloying, though the nice complexity in the flavors helps the situation...still, would be better if the sweetness were toned down some. Overall, nice complexity and melding of the flavors (the BA and age significantly improves it over the original)...and somehow fits in excellently here at Christmastime.

3051,"2015-11-14",4.0,"Pours a dark chesnut brown color with mahogany/plum edges and a one finger off-white head that quickly settles into a thin, lasting ring. Spotty lace left behind. 

Slightly smokey aroma with a prominent barrel presence yet it doesnt interfere with smoke, barleywine and sweet maple notes. Dry oak/toothpick with burnt sugar and subtle bourbon along with leathery malts, smoke, toffee, caramel and dark fruit. A bit of vanilla and coconut from the barrel along with charcoal, liquid smoke, fig, raisin, plum and date.

On the fuller end of medium body with a strong barrel presence thats nicely integrated into the barleywine notes. Damp oak, strong vanilla bean and toasted coconuts with decent bourbon flavor thats not overpoweringly hot or boozy. Spicy bourbon, vanilla and coconut followed by leathery malt, boozy sweetness, maple syrup, subtle smoke, date, fig, raisin and plum. Nice integration but still has prominent barrel and barleywine flavor. Smoke is a bit tame and there is some heat but the high ABV is well masked making this beer decently drinkable. A complex and flavorful barrel aged beer that doesnt hammer you over the head with bourbon. I enjoyed this beer and am looking forward to my other bottles.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

3051,"2013-06-16",4.0,"750mL thanks to t0rin0, Womencantsail, and Travlr for my wedding reception! Another big hit. Clear deep amber pour generates quite a yellow head, more dense than expected. Nose is heavy, rich bourbon, buttery barrel, maple syrup, mild seasoned tomato, black pepper, rum soaked sponge cake. Taste is spicy and sharper barrel forward like Goose Island King Henry. Almost identical barrel character to Bourbon County Stout. Mild sweet maple, pecans perhaps, no smokiness really. Still, a boss barleywine that got the thumbs up from my barleywine loving friends. Thank you!","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
3051,"2013-06-16",4.0,"Bottle courtesy of T0rin0 to GT2 and biggirlpanties,graciously shared at their wedding - thank you all!  Rich, velvety, complex barleywine with notes of vanilla, brandy, prunes, maple, toast. Delicious.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3051,"2013-05-26",3.9,"Bottle. Murky, copper red color with a light tan head. Caramel, toffee, dark fruit, and booze notes. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Chewy. Lots of sweet caramel flavors upfront, and then the booze cuts through and cuts the sweetness. Little bit of spiciness too. Ends fairly cleanly. Pretty tasty. Could probably use some time to chill to cut tr booze flavors.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
3051,"2013-05-19",4.0,"Amber/red pour, Aroma is killer with smokey, wood, caramel sweetness.  Taste adds some bourbon, vanilla and molasses.  Damn tasty.","Chandler, Arizona, USA","JPDurden24"
3051,"2013-05-12",4.3,"Damn, I love these guys!  Popped the cap and a plume of smoke wafted out, filling my nostrils with toasted oak, rich bourbon, vanilla, caramel, toffee, and maple.  Mrs. Butterworth, Aunt Jemima, and all of Canada would be proud!  Flavor shows charred wood, molasses, freshly split vanilla bean, brown sugar, cocoa, maple, and beautiful bourbon.  The alcohol in this is present, warming as it slides down and showing on the tongue but it isnt overly distracting.  A bit of time might round this out but it is delicious now.  Syrupy texture would make an amazing addition to pancakes.  Yum!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
3051,"2013-05-07",4.2,"Big ol thanks to El Capitan, Bman1113vr, for this guy. Dark orange caramel looking pour. Nose is pine, bourbon, leather, malts, maple.

3051,"2013-05-01",4.1,"Pours semi transparent dark brown with a thick tan head. The nose is big English toffee, caramel, vanilla, raisins and molasses. The taste is heavy sweet with medium bitterness throughout. The texture is soft at first but turns sharp. The body is heavy and finish is long!

3051,"2013-04-09",3.8,"On tap and Bottle. Pours with a murky bronze hue with an off-white head that fades. Aromas are of maple, nutty, bourbon, molasses, minerals, cola, vanilla and light smoke. Rich barrel. Flavors are a bit thin and a touch musty, alcohol, nutty, cola, medium dry tannins, smokey. Medium carbonation and warming with a nice hit of bourbon barrel on the back end.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
3051,"2013-04-05",4.2,"Thanks to bman1113vr for sharing this bottle. Pours a dark amber color with an off-white head. The aroma is full of maple, a light bit of smoke, bourbon, caramel and toffee. The flavor is equally delicious and equally complex. I get some smoke up front, but that quickly dissipates in favor of maple, bourbon, vanilla, oak, toffee and caramel. I also get some alcohol notes. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
3051,"2013-03-27",4.1,"Amber pour, off white head.  Aroma is killer with smoke, caramel, bourbon, oak, brown sugar, honey.  Flavor is really awesome.

3051,"2013-03-24",3.8,"I preferred the non-barrel incarnation of this one. This one has some added complexity but also added oxidation notes.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
3051,"2013-03-17",4.0,"September 8th, 2011 - I believe this sample was on the list of limited edition beers that were going fast; these are the ones tucked at the bottom right of AleSmiths chalkboard. They frequently change, and thats not because AleSmith is tossing out good beer. Demand drives variety, and in this case I happened to be fortunate enough to land on a day when they were pouring Barrel Aged Old Decadence. The aroma is incredibly boozy, reflecting the time spent in the barreled penitentiary, and a dozen scents familiar to my bourbon and whiskey shelf entice my nose: caramel, sugar, apple, pineapple, pine, wood, syrup, etc. The flavor introduces an acidic dimension which plays well with the complexity of the flavors, adding white grape juice to a low a slow swirling vat of darker, sweeter flavors. In fact, this almost tastes more like an Imperial Red than it does a Barley Wine. Whatever its categorical definition, the flavor is strangely but alluringly sour, offering a delicious puckering to an ornate balance of delicious whiskey barrel-infused flavors.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"
3051,"2013-03-09",4.0,"Cask at Alesmith.  Slightly hazy yellowish amber pour, with a darker off-white head.  Lots of bourbon, vanilla, sweet toffee, maple syrup, still some smoke in here too, boozy, and a hint of chocolate.  Nicely done as always, Alesmith.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
3051,"2013-03-05",3.9,"Opaque mahogany pour with a miniscule white head. Huge bourbon and booze aromas. Nice vanilla, maple syrup, and brown sugar. Some chocolate oxidation notes, oak, caramel, and smoke. The flavor is very sweet and very barrel forward. Tons of bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Maple syrup, brown sugar, and caramel sweetness. Some chocolate, alcohol, and a smoke flavor that becomes more prevalent as the beer warms up.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3051,"2013-03-04",4.0,"Bottle, picked up at the same time as BA Kopi; poured into a tulip.  Pours amber with medium white head.  Aroma is smoke, maple, bourbon.  Flavor is caramel, toffee, maple, booze, with an alcoholic finish.  Very smooth.","El Cajon, California, USA","wheresyourball"
3051,"2013-03-03",4.1,"Bottle; picked up from the brewery alongside the BA Kopi Luwak Speedway. Color is dark amber with medium carbonation, capped with a small head of vanilla colored foam. Smoked malts show through in the aroma with lots of bourbon and hot alcohol. Flavor is a sweet blend of caramel, toffee, chocolate truffle and cherry, finishing bitter with an oaky barrel-aged nuance. The alcohol really takes over the finish, with a pronounced bourbon note. Give it a few more years to mellow out, still kind of hot at this point. Overall really, really tasty.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"
3051,"2013-02-25",3.9,"750ml bottle from brewery. Pours a murky dark brown color with a medium tan head that audibly fizzes away to a film. The aroma is dominated by the whiskey barrel aging along with some dark fruits and a bit of sherry. The flavor is similar to the nose with the whiskey in the forefront backed up nicely by lightly smokey grains, raisins, dates, and a bit of maple. The palate is full and silky smooth with lively carbonation. Finishes long and hot. Overall: Lots of hot alcohol in this one, watch out. I had to pair this with some fine cheeses (Gruyere and Jarlsberg) to cut the booze and make this enjoyable.  Id recommend aging this for a couple of years to see if it comes together a bit better.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"
