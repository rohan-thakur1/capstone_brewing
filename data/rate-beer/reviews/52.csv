52,"2013-12-03",5.0,"It seems that everyone has a pumpkin beer these days and from July until November stores are inundated with these beers that seem to think that cramming copious amounts of nutmeg and allspice laced with grandmommas perfume somehow makes a good beer ( yes I am looking at you Southern Tier). You try these potpourri beers one after the other hoping that somewhere someone will make pumpkin beer that will not end with an asthma attack. You think maybe it's just not possible to make a pumpkin beer that is drinkable and then you taste the Selinsgrove pumpkin ale and it's.... Smooth, creamy, semi sweet, semi spicy... Just like a good pumpkin pie. You taste something... It's good... You cannot quite place it but you know you want more.","North Carolina, USA","hickboyg8"
52,"2013-10-20",3.9,"Pours an opaque orange/amber with a creamy medium tan head...nice retention. Aroma is subdued probably due to the tight nitro head but has light doughy malts...caramel and faint graham, creamy pumpkin and well balanced spices...cinnamon, clove.

52,"2012-10-21",4.0,"on nitro which was a bummer. I prefer more carbonation. Tons of spices that are subtle so you get this very energy complex flavoring, good pumpkin flavoring, one of the best","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
52,"2012-02-04",3.6,"On nitro at Selins Grove last weekend. Served in a pint glass. Reviewed from notes.

Pours a rusty orange-amber with a decent-sized off-white head that falls fairly quickly and doesnt leave much lacing, especially considering the serving type. The nose brings some really nice pumpkin pie character with a bit of spice and sweetness. Integrated spices with nothing over the top. The flavor carries this through. Mouthfeel is what really makes this beer. The nitro delivery is brilliant and the spices are just right through the finish. Great medium body and smooth carbonation. Really well done.",", Illinois, USA","Thorpe429"
52,"2012-01-03",3.8,"Served on nitro-tap at Selins Grove into a pint. Paired with a bowl of pumpkin soup. Such a good combo.

A - Pours a deep orange with a strong, creamy, two finger white head that leaves light lacing down the entire glass.

S - Light spices add a nice complement to all that pumpkin aroma. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and all the other pumpkin pie spices you would imagine are in this one. A very nice balance.

T - The spices dominate this one. Cinnamon, nutmeg, and all the other spices help warm the pallet. The pumpkin flavors are ever present but dont come to the forefront until the finish. A great balance off spices and pumpkin.

M - Heavy flavor with a medium body and excellent carbonation. Very creamy feel on the pallet. The flavors are strong but dont linger for very long.

D - The strong spices bring it down a few notches but it is still a very enjoyable pumpkin offering. One of the best pumpkin beers I have ever had.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
52,"2011-11-06",3.3,"On tap at brewpub. Pours dark orange with a half an inch of thick creamy foam. Theres a faint hint of pumpkin on the nose. The pumpkin is more prominent on the tongue with a cinnamon vibe on the finish. Solid example of the style.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
52,"2011-10-15",4.2,"On tap at brewpub. Dark orange with thick cream head. Aroma is surprisingly faint. Flavor is predominantly pumpkin (unlike most pumpkins which are spice-dominated), with nice butter/creaminess and cinnamon. Very rich and delicious.","USA","jar72404"

52,"2010-11-25",3.2,"Nitro tap at pub. Dark amber color with a frothy white head. Nose exhibits crust, light spice and pumpkin, and a dose of sweetness from the yeast-heavy house character. Flavor has stronger grain bitterness, minor dough and allspice, very little pumpkin and a bit thin. Creamy body, bit heavy for the lighter profile, at least until pumpkin begins finishing at room temp.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
52,"2009-11-23",4.6,"Rating #1200. On tap at Selins Grove. Pours clear amber with a big tan nitro head. Aroma that reminds me more of apple pie than pumpkin. Spice seems to be all cinnamon (maybe a bit of ginger) with some nice sweetness that isnt overbearing. Cinnamon flavor with hints of allspice and ginger, a bit of sweet malt and a clean semi-dry finish. Awesome beer and it seems that simplicity is the key. Easily the best nitro beer Ive ever had.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
52,"2009-11-17",4.0,"On nitro at the brewpub. Had it just in time for Halloween. Pours a dark amber colour with a rich, creamy, large beige coloured head. Aroma of nutmeg, pumpkin, and cinnamon. Nutty flavor of spices, nutmeg, cinnamon, cream, and pumpkin. The palate is a little watery which diminishes the flavour.","Doylestown, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerapprentice"

52,"2009-11-14",3.5,"Enjoyed on nitro-tap at the brewpub.Surprisingly good for pumpkin and for nitrogen.  Mild spicey, more on the nutmeg. Light orange.  A bit less than medium mouthfeel.  Lasting white head.  Easy drinking, smooth.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
52,"2009-10-31",4.7,"Nitro tap @ Brewpub.  we made a special trip just to try this and it was well worth it, not as good as southern tiers pumking, but still great..   amber body with great creamy head... aroma of pumpkin and vanilla... body is very creamy and smooth, light... low alcohol content... overall very tasty and easy to drink.. well balanced spices and pumpkin flavor","Lancaster, Pennsylvania, USA","KornDogg"
52,"2009-10-29",4.4,"Nitro tap @ brewpub. Not many beers live up to the hype, including 3 hours of driving excitement, but this is by far the best pumpkin beer I have ever had. Dark golden pour with some white head. Pumpkin spices, cinnamon, vanilla, this was delicious and smelled just as nice. Mostly the fact it is only 5 percent and still has a great full bodied texture and flavor is what kills it.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
52,"2009-10-25",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2011 Draft at Selins Grove Brewpub.  Pours an amber body with a creamy vanilla head.  Huge lush cinnamon notes, like smelling a cinnamon shaker.  Pumpkin pie, and vanilla nitrogenous like notes.  Creamy whip body with a beautiful cinnamon spiced accent.  This beer is phenomenal, it completely blew me away, at 5% per the menu, i couldnt believe the body that this one had.  I had to have myself another and if the brewpub didnt close at midnight boy i would have been  in trouble.  Its very rare to find so much quality flavor with such a full body and yet have so little alcohol influence.  Absolutely 100% the best beer ive had in this style.  This blows away any other pumpkin beer ive had to date by a landslide.  So so so good!  4.7
2011 ~6 pints
Nitro. Pours a deep amber toned lightly crimson bruin body with a 3/4 tan heady tone with light retention n almost no retention.  Aromatically all pumpkin, cinnamon, lighter squash tones a hint of cardamine n softer herbal vegetative tones. Very soft body nitrogenous n soft creamy toned body very subtle yet complex.  Huge flavorful burst of cinnamon upfront, not sweet as one might expect but more so sharp spicy without being hot so to speak.  Softly toning down to squash/pumpkin tones. A hint of seed n spice to finish light lingering/tingling cinnamon.  Delicous n incredibly quaffable.  A solid pumpkin ale n morre. 4.3","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
52,"2009-06-14",4.0,"On tap at the brewpub on 10/25/08: Pours a hazy dark copper amber with a dense, creamy light tan head.  Aroma of sweet cinnamon and chewy pumpkin flesh with a hint of roasty character.  Body starts with good fullness and juicy pumpkin flavor with a nice nutmeg and cinnamon spice balance before a slightly drier doughy finish.  A very tasty and well-balanced complex pumpkin brew with great drinkability.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
52,"2009-05-27",4.2,"Nitro pour at Selins Grove. Cloudy copper orange color with a fluffy nitro head that lasts. Aroma of pumpkin and pumpkin pie spices with some yeast and breadyness.

52,"2009-02-09",4.0,"Nitro pour at Selins Grove.  Pours a murky hazy woody orange with a thick nice fluffy tight nitro head and great lace.  Aroma is your typical pumpkin pie spice, a bit of creamy wheat, toasted malts, light smooth sweet crystal and carapils malt- nutmeg and some clove as it warms.  Flavor is doughy smooth light yeastiness, toffee, and lots of all spice pumpkin pie spice with some whipped cream smooth light sweetness.  Smooth creamy mouthfeel and a nice overall beer especially for a pumpkin beer but I heard people saying it just wasnt as good as it was last year.  It was really good but just not mind blowing like I had thought it would be.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
52,"2009-01-04",4.3,"Nitro on a sampler platter.
Great overall pumpkin ale, tough to beat.  Smells strongly of cinnamon and nutmeg, looks like a pumpkin pie filling color in a glass.  Tart and spicy on the tongue, lacking the sweetness that ruins many pumpkin ales.  Nutmeg tones remain after the cinnamon fades from the palate.  Smooth and satisfying.","Charlottesville, Virginia, USA","pjweaver"
52,"2008-11-18",4.3,"On nitro at the brewpub.  I have been wanting to try this beer for a while now, but havent been able to arrange to get there at the right time of year.  We stopped by for lunch on our way to Hershey and I was not dsiappointed.  Pours a hazy orange with a thin-moderate dense, creamy, linen white head that lasted until the end and left ample lace throughout.  Very pleasant aroma of pumpkin pie spice including cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice.  Some pumkpin in there as well, but the aroma is more influenced by the spice than the pumpkin.  The flavor is very similar with the same pumpkin pie spices as the aroma. The mouthfeel, aided by the nitrogen push, is silky and creamy and suits this beer extremely well.  This might just be my favorite pumpkin beer this year.","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
52,"2008-10-31",4.5,"Nitro. Of course. Aroma of pumpkin pie; mellow spices, sweet pumpkin, and, call me crazy, but I smelled whipped cream too. Either it was there and awesome, or the rest of it was so pumpkin-pie like that my mind just automatically added it, so a plus either way. Flavor is, as I wrote, holy crap. pumpkin pie. The nitro REALLY works well with this one, giving it a creamy texture that is the final straw in separating from th rest of the pumpkins. Excellent.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
52,"2008-10-28",4.3,"Nitro Tap.  Poured a dark orange with a thick creamy tan head.  Aroma of pie spices and pumpkin.  Flavor is very cinnamony, with pumpkin mixed in.  Creamy body.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","nqualls"
52,"2008-10-27",3.8,"Nitro draft at the brewpub. The first thing you might notice about this pumpkin beer is that you can actually taste the pumpkin mixed in with the pie spices.  Aroma was fresh, roasted pumpkin flesh, nutmeg and other pie spices and vanilla. The initial spices were followed by a bready taste which was a bit distracting to the whole effect. Seemed a little thin at the finish.","Swedesboro, New Jersey, USA","MrBendo"
52,"2008-10-27",3.9,"On nitro tap at the brewpub.  Pours dark orange with a thick light tan nitro head.  Aroma of cinnamon, brown sugar, and whipped cream.  Flavor is more of the same--lots of sugar and cinnamon.  The nitro gives it a smooth body.  Definitely my favorite pumpkin ale (although it’s not really pumpkiny so much as full of pumpkin spices).  It reminds me of my 2nd favorite pumpkin beer (John Harvards Pumpkin Spice) except that instead of actual cinnamon and sugar on the rim of the glass, this beer has incorporated these flavors.  Personally I didn’t quite enjoy the nitro tap as I like a beer to have decent carbonation, but apart from that I really have no complaints.  Top notch beer.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LilBeerDoctor"
52,"2008-10-26",3.8,"On tap (nitro) at the brewpub.  Orange in color, good creamy white head. Aroma of pumpkin, spices and some cinnamon. Taste was very creamy...

52,"2008-10-26",4.0,"On nitro at brew pub. Poured a nice amber with very thick white head that left milk mustache. Aroma was cinnamon, spice, pie crust. Taste was cinnamon, baked pumpkin pie, spice, and nutmeg. Finished very nice, smooth and creamy. Very drinkable and enjoyable, but personally Southern Tiers Pumking is better.","Elkton, Maryland, USA","Swolf3"
52,"2008-10-26",4.2,"On tap at the Selins Grove Brew Pub. Nitro. This one was the reason for making the long trip out (I had very high hopes for it!). I heard they just kicked a keg before we got there and almost didnt put on another one right away (they had to call the brewer to find out where it was - or something like that).
Poured a medium and cloudy amber color with a smaller sized off white head. Aromas of pumpkins, pumpkin seeks, cinnamon, and pumpkin pie crust. Tastes of pumpkins, vanilla, pumpkin pie crust, and spices. Dont get me wrong, this was a pretty good beer, but it didnt quite live up to my expectations (that being said, I would drink this everyday if I had the chance to!).","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
52,"2008-10-26",4.2,"Poured a nitro’d amber, with a creamy, medium sized, off white head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of pie crust, cinnamon, nutmeg, toffee, and vanilla.

52,"2008-10-24",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 25, 2008 Draft at the brewpub. Noses in a soft cinnamon oil, vibrant freshly grated Nutmeg and splash of boiled whole allspice. A bit of malt sugar brings up the rear. Subdued due to temperature and gas delivery. Flavor is rich and nuanced. A great balance of spice and wheat malt(?). Theres a bit of chewiness and caramel that adds depth to the spice profile, which is near perfection. Really this beer wins because of how balanced, diffused and integrated. Its just at that nice level thats not overwhelming and potpourri-like. Theres a deeper hearty warm pie character that transcends spice, malt and pumpkin meat. A light leaf of hop adds another drop of complexity. Very delicious, fresh and bright. Very good. Maybe not mind-bending, but excelling thanks to high drinkability, perfect spice level and gentle complex sweetness, something that most spice beers try to achieve, but often fail at doing. And Wow, only 4.5%. Flourishes out with a really delicate, but noticeable wildflower honey note and a touch of soft, caramelized pumpkin flesh.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
52,"2007-12-20",4.5,"Draft at Brewpub. Pours hazy orange with an small beige head. Aroma is pumpkin; fresh pumpkin, like you just stuck your head into a freshly carved pumpkin.  Hints a spices are evident, but not over done.  This is a very natural pumpkin taste, and it makes all other pumpkin beers look bad. Perfect amounts of nutmeg, and cinnamon. Extremely drinkable and very impressive!","Silver Spring, Pennsylvania, USA","Miver"
52,"2007-12-09",4.5,"Poured a cloudy orange body with an off-white peppered head.  The aroma is fresh cut pumpkin that is nicely, but not overly spiced.  Just enough to complement but not take away from the pumpkin.  The flavor is the same way.  Big, fresh pumpkin meat with a little spice.  The most natural tasting pumpkin anything Ive ever had!!","New Providence, Pennsylvania, USA","axilla"
52,"2007-11-23",4.4,"Draft, Selins Grove Brewing Co.  Pours a hazy, golden-orange color; off-white head with fine-bubbled lacing.  Wonderful, generous aroma: shows (oddly enough) the mild, raspberry- and cherry-tinged tartness of the Phoenix Kriek, but melded with an excellent, soft spicing of cinnamon and nutmeg; just a gorgeous aroma and unlike anything Ive ever smelled; pumpkin pie and kriek.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: dense, warm pumpkin pie spicing and graham cracker maltiness upfront; not overly sticky or roughly spiced at all; generous, beautiful pumpkin ale, with some dried red fruits and more pumpkin and cinnamon coming through at mid-palate; immensely dense for 4.5%.  I could drink buckets of this.  Medium, cinnamon, nutmeg, and toasty grains in the finish.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
52,"2007-10-29",4.4,"Multiple pints, at brewpub.  Pours a clear orangish copper under a creamy one inch nitrogenated off-white head.  The spicing is incredible on the nose, the usual cinnamon, allspice, and nutmeg, with a little caramel malt, and fresh scooped pumpkin meat.  Reminded me of a fresh baked pumpkin whoopie pie.  The flavor is much more subtle with the spices, just light cinnamon and allspice with lots of meaty pumpkin on the finish.  The most distinctive pumpkin beer as far as conveying the pumpkin flavor instead of the usual hodgepodge of pie spices.  Mouthfeel is incredibly creamy with the nitrogen serving method.  In general Im not a huge fan of nitro, but it was great the way it worked with this beer.  Overall, easily the best pumpkin beer Ive ever had, this made Weyerbachers Imperial Pumkin look like crap.  Very natural tasting.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
52,"2007-10-28",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 22, 2009 By far my favorite pumpkin ale. Slightly sweet cinnamon and pumpkin flavor mixed with some other malts. Lingering pumpkin aftertaste.

52,"2007-10-28",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2012 2007 vintage
Pint at Selins Grove.  Moderately muddy orange and near-brown colored body with a finely-bubbled foamy tan head.  This may be one of the few times when I stick my nose into a beer without knowing what to expect and have it completely blow me away.  I cant do it justice with my limited rating ability (they should have sent a poet), but dear lord this thing smelled amazing: rich, creamy and spicy pumpkin soup with a hint of whipped cream, some apple cider aromas and some pumpkin bread and cinnamon as well.  Ridiculously amazing aroma.  Flavorwise its almost the same, with the whipped cream/pumpkin pie and apple cider flavors, made even better, I think, by a rich and creamy-smooth nitrogen palate.  I could seriously drink this beer through the entire fall and winter, and its one of those rare beers you will look back on and crave over and over.


2008 version

Maybe a little more sweet up front, certainly served too cold, opens up very well with temperature.  Huge spiced pumpkin pie all over this thing, nutmeg is strong and peppery.  Less meaty and less of the creamy pumpkin pie charachter than the 2007.  Still an amazing beer.  Last years was a 4.6, this perhaps is 4.0-4.3.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
