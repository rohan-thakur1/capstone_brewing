4585,"2016-09-30",4.0,"Canned on May 6, 2016. Misty golden. Creamy white halo of foam. Very bright, focused, and uplifting ""airy"" aroma of lemon verbena, honeysuckle, pepper, cracker dough and uncured hay. Firm prickles of dense carbonation. Strikingly vibrant and flavorsome hops adorn the soft pils malt with a supple wave of oils on initial sip. Malt exhibits the well-mashed depth of baguette, yet retains just as much grassy levity which recalls uncured hay. Tremendously floral hop character boasts a softness akin to rose petals splashed lightly with nectar. Boundless lemony notes are harmoniously nestled against the herbal zippiness as they reinforce the multilayered hoppiness with considerable sophistication. A crackery snap to the malt ever so gently generates a tinge of dryness, supplying structure to the remarkably soft body while enlivening the underlying tickle of fennel seed herbality. Malt is amazingly lean, with a smidgeon of starchiness to enrich the body with sufficiency of texture. Integrated and squeaky-clean finish features grassy hay preceding oily, hard lemon-candylike hop flavors which linger in perpetuity. What we have here is an unabashedly hoppy and stylish pils thats German to the core (obviously the recipe has changed or the RB description is inaccurate, because this shares absolutely no parallels with Czech pils). It is very reminiscent of Pivo Pils from Firestone Walker, with that ultra vibrant and zingy Saphir note. But whereas that one can be brash and ""green"", this one is softer and more elegant without exchanging that for any hoppy dynamism. Discerning from the bright hop burps, this has been dry-hopped extensively, which is my only quibble since a well-made pils doesnt benefit from dry-hopping. So, who knows if the hops in this would seem raw and green in a really fresh can. Either way, Im truly impressed that this is still so vital after four months from packaging. A Hallertau bomb!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

4585,"2016-07-23",3.2,"draft glass that poured a yellow color with white head. for me a pils is suppose to be sharp and crisp with a definite hop aroma and flavor. this was a litte mushy. the biggest put off was the floral hop flavor. was a little over the top in floral and there was no crispness to this one it kind of just slid off the tongue. really not a fan of this pils.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","tmongoose"

Its got a bready malt character and a kiss of sweetness helps bring out some lemon zest citrus and seems to highlight the firm but gentle bitterness in the finish. This is a medium bodied beer w/ softly vigorous carbonation. I am not sure this is spot on the the Czech style but its exactly what I want out of a Pilsner, magnificently drinkable w/ tons of noble hop character.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Super smooth, kind of crisp, lighter carbonation. Awesome bready doughy malt, seeing some of the mild honey. Light peppery and floral hop. Fruitier aromas than your typical pilsener.
