1554,"2016-06-17",3.4,"Pour is a cloudy yellow with a large white head. Aroma is a nice tropical fruit/citrus hop that leaps out of the glass. Flavor is again a nice juicy fruit hop with some honey malt. Finish is dry and not much of the hop is left after the swallow, you get more of a wheat bread.

1554,"2015-12-19",3.4,"Can. Slightly hazy orange with a dense white head. Aroma of mandarins, herbal lemon, mango lassi. Juicy with some plain hay and wheat thats not all that sweet. Not very bitter but dries out enough to make it a finish. Another more than pleasant Golden Road beer that for me is just a bit too strong for what it offers.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

1554,"2015-09-06",4.2,"12oz can pours with a clear deep gold body that has thin copper hues and supports a full dirty white head of foam. The modest aroma offers up mango and tangerine and then some orange zest in the background. The taste is hitting the spot as the medium body ushers in both bitter and juicy citrus to tropical fruity hoppiness. I get tangerine and grapefruit bitter hops flowing into a small pool of mango like juiciness. To midway those notes are met by a modest level of spicy onion dankness. Solid brew.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
