3802,"2017-03-16",4.0,"750 ml bottle shared by alagnak. The pour is a hazed orange golden with a smallish white head. The aroma is wine barrel, lactose, funk, citrus, and a soft bready malt. The taste is a really nice balance of the citrus notes, the bread malt, red wine notes and the funk lactose bright tart sour character. The palate is medium bodied with natural carbonation and a dry tart acidic finish. Nice one, thanks for holding on to this one for me and sharing Chris.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

3802,"2016-12-13",4.6,"Bottle, saved from the release in May for the big 1,000 (!) Rate Beer check-in. Believe the hype. This,to me, is the pinnacle of what an obsessively crafted beer can taste like. Every element is executed brilliantly -- theres a light touch of bready malt flavor, faint hop bitterness, and a cacophony of wine, cider, fruit, and funk flavors from the yeast and barrel aging -- but everything comes together in a beautiful balance. The mouthfeel stands out, with a light and dry opening that lasts surprisingly long, allowing the flavors to all linger. Very reminiscent of wine, with lots of tannin and bright fruit aromas. I cant tell if Im crying from how good this tastes or how sad I am that Ill probably never drink it again.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

3802,"2016-08-01",4.1,"b4. Merci à Marc-André pour le partage de cette magnifique rareté! Dun point de vue esthétique, le liquide ressemble beaucoup à Arthur, exception faite que cette déclinaison me paraît plus huileuse, résultat sans doute attribuable au vieillissement en barrique de vin blanc. Arômes bien ficelées de vin blanc et de houblons citronnés qui nous ramène à Arthur. Belle rondeur en bouche, le liquide est toutefois bien moins beurré qu anticipé. Le trio funk-houblons-vin blanc est maîtrisé à la perfection et se présente à moi en toute légèreté. Vu le prix et la rareté de ce produit très attendu par le monde entier, je mattendais à un niveau de complexité supérieur. Lensemble est remarquablement équilibré et demeure somme toute straight-forward.

3802,"2015-08-06",4.2,"April 2014 Magnum shared by Adam C on 7/25/15.Another fantastic pour, obviously having had a good deal of time to really build up plenty of carbonation in the bottle. Large white head tops a soft golden, lightly hazy body.I believe as soon as we started drinking this, immediately following Arthur (could be Ann vs Anna, but its the same argument), someone said right away, ""Wow, not even close between this and Arthur."" (implying this, being barrel-aged, was way better). I VERY quickly disagreed and while I dont know if its better or worse, I dont like that barrel aging is just automatically associated with higher quality, more finely crafted beers. Sure, the beer takes longer to produce but I dont think that says anything about quality. Im not always in the mood for a more dull, tannic, lactic, generally drier, lighter beer. Especially the case here, where I much preferred the aroma on Arthur, being completely different and vastly brighter. Still just as complex despite the lack of the wine and wood element. I think people often vastly overestimate the effect barrel-aging has on a beer.ANYWAYS....this was much more reserved in the nose than CD14; not a noseful of wine at all and the sauv blanc is very nicely integrated, allowing citrus, vanilla and light cereal grain notes. Dulled by the tannin, as expected, and I much prefer the regular versions aroma.Strong acids in the mouth show grape and lactic influences, with honey-like maltiness, bread dough and moderate fruitiness (stone fruits, light citrus). Lip smacking acidity on the end is very well balanced thanks to the attenuation level, which is near-perfect here, allowing enough malt texture and sugar to balance. Lemons and soft, light floral notes linger. Tight carbonation as always from HF.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3802,"2013-03-10",4.3,"750ml bottle. Batch 2, aged at least 5-6 months...maybe a bit more. The pour yields a medium golden body that starts out mostly clear, but becomes increasingly cloudy with each careful pour. A thick head of off-white froth holds strong, fading very slowly. Dense swaths of fluffy lace coat nearly the entire glass. On the nose, the wine barrel influence is immediate and pervasive. Dry, vinous oak comes across peppery and spicy. Following is ample white grape must, elderflower, and secondary hints of tart berry fruit. After clearing the initial tart, oaky blanket, a base of wheat and dry cereal grain emerges, setting the stage for hints of orange peel and distant coriander. It smells quite dusty, showing signature Hill Farmstead house funk. Hops are floral as can be, suggesting of citrus blossoms and maybe a touch of lemongrass. With a fantastic aroma to live up to, the flavor does not disappoint. Again supremely oaky, showing peppery, mineralic tendencies backed by sharp white and link fruit, the wine takes center stage. Dried, dusty wheat and crushed dry flowers move in, followed by some citrus acidity and tart, funky farmhouse yeast. So many layers, I could go on for days. The palate is effervescent, lending a champagne-like tingle to the dry body. The acidity is bracing up front, giving way to a surprisingly lengthy hop finish. The elderflower character reminds me of somethign from Fantôme or Cazeau, only more refined and complex than both. What can I say? Another masterpiece from Shaun Hill. This is almost becoming routine.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
3802,"2013-03-10",4.1,"Sampled March 2011; RBWG
The beer pours from the bottle with a pale, touch of haze to it, gold color and it is topped by a pale head of froth. Herbal hop notes are noticeable up front in the aroma, with a hint of citrus, some peppery yeast character, a mustiness, and even a hint of plastic like phenolics being noticeable. A cracker like malt character provides a nice, pale grain note to the nose that helps to round things out.

The beer is dry, almost woody, and has a hint of tartness to it as it first hits the palate. A bitter, biting hop character is noticeable from the front of each sip thorugh to the lingering finish; some green hop notes especially linger on the tongue. An earthy, yeast derived spice character in the finish melds with the hop character (specifically the hay, and coriander like notes), and woody, pepper-like notes. This is very light bodied, as a Saison should be, it is really refreshing, but has lots of firmness to the flavor. This is quite nice, really enjoyable, and a I really would like a bottle of this to contemplate on my own. This has a huge flavor, is sharp, gripping, spicy, with enough pale malt character to tie things together, and it is just oh-so quaffable.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The beer appears hazy and yellow hued with a half inch of white head and some decent lacing. The aroma is fabulous. Red wine, wild yeast, floral notes, citrus, funk. Yeah, Im digging this. The flavor is very good, though not quite as remarkable as the aroma. Nice feel on the palate. Complex and delicious. This was my favorite of the five saisons I sampled that night. I would enjoy having this again. Recommended.

I see no mention on the bottle description) and I dont know why but Im thinking of glaciers. It just smells FRESH and clean. On to the appearance. This is a beautiful hazy golden color with the whitest and most fluffiest head there is, which also sticks around and coats the surface like a snowy northeastern lake in the winter time. Lots of visible bubbles. Lacing is thick and sticky. This is a really good looking beer! Taste is of oak, white wine, lemon zest, a little barnyard tang and some slight hop earthy bitterness to balance it out. This is definitely a highly carbonated beer, and so it should be. Its crisp, clean, and goes down very easily despite its high level of bloatiness. Overall, this beer is awesome and has solidified to me the popularity of Hill Farmstead. Im glad I got to try this and wish I could source this locally. Upright from Portland makes some very similar beers in their Sole Comp series.

3802,"2012-05-12",3.9,"750 mL bottle, poured into a tulip.

Pours a filtered, hazed golden straw color with a dense, frothy white head that initially fills the glass. Abundant lacing coats the glass and the head has nice retention supported by a consistent stream of bubbles.

Aroma is very dry, vinous and yeasty. Some residual sweetness with oak/vanilla, ripe grapes, and banana but earth and red wine dominate. Not much presence of spice or funk. 

Smooth, medium-thick body. Soft, fine carbonation with a dry, oaky finish. Docking the mouthfeel a little for the finish which is very tannic and oaky. 

Similar experience as Sean preceding me. Not as much wine as the aroma, more vanilla and woodsy oak. More brett funk comes through suppressing the fruity and yeasty sweetness of the aroma.

Another well made, good but not great saison from HF. I enjoy this more than the base Art I had a few months ago, but the wine barrel (particularly oak flavors) are a little too strong. Reminiscent of McKenzies Saison Vautour and honestly a little more consistent in composition. However Vautour is still the standard I look for in this style of wine barrel/wild saisons.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","yourefragile"

3802,"2011-05-14",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 13, 2017 Pours  gold - a slight bit of haze with a puffy 3 finger head that leaves big rings of lace.  Aromas of earthy brett, lemon, white grape, hay and oak - very complex.  Taste is spot on - light Oaked malts balanced with a hint of dry white grape, green apple, lemongrass, white pepper and very slight bitterness and sourness - VERY easy to drink.  Medium bodied with fairly high carbonation.  A winner and worth the long drive to the farmstead!","","Johnsense"
3802,"2011-04-24",4.1,"Huge, huge thanks to sisuspeed for opening this bottle at the Rosso release. Served in a SAVOR snifter.

Pours a mild straw color with a really nice, fluffy white head that sticks around for quite a bit of time. Really nice lacing as it goes down. The nose is really nice with some complex earthy funk as well as grain and hay plus a touch of oak. Funk keeps coming, and also brings a hint of white grapes and mild stone fruit. The flavor is along the same lends, blending the funk with the base malt well and adding in slight fruit complexity. Mildly sweet feel is fairly light with a nicely dry finish. Really fantastic. Thanks again, John.

3802,"2011-04-10",4.7,"On draft at Blind Tiger for the Hill Farmstead event with James. Pours a blisteringly bright, yet hazy, neon yellowish orange with a tall, two-finger, bubbly white sudsy white head. Aroma is marked by tons of sharp, savory farmhouse funkiness, along with some zesty orange, lemon, and peach tang, some soft pineapple and guava notes, and a lovely wash of soft oaky, vanilla, earthy notes. Sipping this beer, the first tastes to roll over the tongue are lemon, honey, and tons of tart, lactic acidic notes. Hugely juicy, yet stunningly dry and tongue sappingly dry. Very, very special beer.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","patrickfannon"
3802,"2011-04-08",4.5,"Poured into a Hill Farmstead tasting glass. A clear, straw-yellow body holds up a thick, foamy, white head. Each sip leaves some beautiful lacing on the glass.

Wet hay and earthy oak rise up from a few swirls of the glass. Light fruits and a touch of yeast spice on the nose. Faint white wine grapes and a light brett presence add to the complexity.

Dry, oaky, earthy malts mixed with light wine barrel fruitiness compose the taste. Faint orchard fruit, apple, hay and earthiness. Malts, yeast and barrels in perfect harmony. Exceptional.

Mouthfeel is earthy and musty with a touch of sweetness, but mostly dry throughout. Feels great for the style.

Overall, this is an amazing saison. Essentially flawless in every way. From the nose, to the flavor, to the mouthfeel, Shaun has nailed this one on the head. The wine oak barrels plus the house yeast make this a truly unique and exceptional saison. Probably in my top 3 for the style, if not my favorite. Highly recommended.","New Hampshire, USA","sisuspeed"
3802,"2011-04-07",4.5,"Vintage 2011. 

A soft pour into a tilted tulip immediately spurs a huge pillowy white head of four fingers. The head leaves massive, thick and large-bubbled lacing, softly settling into a finger and a half. The beer itself has mezmerizing clarity (like Anna) on first pour - the tangerine body is clear and luminous. 

A nice bouquet of citrus, oak, and some mineral character. Theres some wet hay and pineapple from the brett. The citrus runs deeply through it, with just a hint of sourness. (This reminds me a lot of good bottles of Sanctification, with the addition of oak.)

The oakiness gives way to citrus thats more orange than lemon in expression. Theres a little bit of white pepper here, along with a constant mustiness and earthiness that envelops the citrus on the front of the palate and the minerality on the finish. A light sourness cuts through the must. The lingering bitterness on the finish whets my palate before the next sip. The tiniest bit of sulphur / rubber in the mid- and late-palate keeps this from a perfect score. 

Medium-light in body with high carbonation (though the body feels slick and oily on the front of the tongue). Medium dryness on the finish.

This saison is drinking elegantly right off the bat, and Im glad I opened this one early, since it displays such a restrained balance (though I would like to dry it after the brett has worked itself more overtly into the beer). A very well imagined saison and likely my favorite to date. I need more of this.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

3802,"2011-02-06",4.7,"UPDATED: AUG 29, 2011 My Bottom Line:
This Wild Saison dazzles the senses with white wine complexity, matching citrusy, herbal hop notes to levelled brettanomyces in a dry and highly drinkable vehicle. What an appropriately named beer.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy tower of foam decorates the shiny yellow.
-The citrusy character is also redolent of citrusy thyme and citrus peel.
-Carbonation is adorably fluffy.
-The oak character blends into the well-developed flavor spectrum. Works perfectly with the wild yeast and fruity hop spiciness.
-The herbal hop bitterness is balanced with the rest of the brews medium intensity.
-The white wine is more apparent in the first half of the bottle if you dont pour any yeast in your glass.

On tap at Hill Farmstead and from a few bottles.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
