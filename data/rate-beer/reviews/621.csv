Creamy oat forward aroma, light milk & cream sweetness with soft cocoa nibs, bakers chocolate, & hints of caramel-like sweetness. Flavor contains a bit more roast & even some light coffee bean, although the presence of semi-sweet, creamy oats is still very much the front runner.

621,"2007-08-15",4.0,"Solid opaque black pour, booming tan head with great retention. The nose is writhing with roasted malt and coffee notes. Also noted are molasses, oats, anise, milk chocolate, nuts and just a touch of sugar. Alcohol is not detected, nor are any flaws. The flavor is highly sweet, moderately bitter, with medium acidity and a roasty tang that lingers. Coffee and roast are perfectly integrated, even in such quantity. the finish is sweet, roasty and sugary, with grains, anise and chocolate lingering. The mouthfeel is extraordinarily smooth, medium-full bodied and slick. Delectable.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

621,"2007-07-06",4.0,"12oz bottle, courtesy of artusory.  Thanks, Ryan!  Pours a very dark brown color; light tan head with fine-bubbled lacing.  Sweet, syrupy aroma: chewy nougat and toffee, with some lightly toasted marshmallow.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: dense, toasty malts and milk chocolate; beautifully balanced level of sweetness, with chewy nougats and toffee - dense, slightly viscous, and damn good.  Lengthy, dry chocolate finish.

621,"2006-07-06",3.9,"2002 Bottling thanks to Mr. Styles!  Poured a big, beautiful, deep brown with an inch or so of medium-density yellowish-toffee head.  Nose is quite enjoyable, and has certainly changed form over the years... picked up a tart dark fruity/licorice component to compliment rich dark and milk chocolates, lactose, and roasted espresso.  Flavor balance was skewed a tad too far in the direction of heavy dark fruit skin tartness, but still maintained composure with a solid cocoa, espresso, and lactose middle.  Bitterness was mild and coffee-centric.  This was still creamy and smooth on the palate after what... 3.5 years or so?

621,"2006-05-12",3.7,"Bottle: Dark brown, nearly black, moderate fizzy beige head, spotty lacing.   Soft roasted malt nose, slight sweetness, but also quite a bit of sourness, fruit skin, and cocoa.   Somewhat dry tart fruit skin flavor to start, roasted malts are softer than suggested by the nose.   Slight bittersweet cocoa like finish, remaining semi-sweet and tart, with lingering fruit skin.   Body and mouthfeel are moderate to full.   Not as heavy or lactose oriented as other examples.   Definitely more tart and dry than I am use to.   Still enjoyable tho.   Founders and Lost Coast still take the cake, in my opinion.   Thanks to CaptainCougar and Styles for each providing me with a bottle!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"

621,"2006-02-23",3.7,"Pours a velvety black into the glass with a thin tan head on top. The foam dissolves quickly leaving behind a few spots of lace and a thin ring around the surface. A roasted malt aroma of chocolate and coffee with a hint of nuts greet you before each sip.This medium bodied beer is smooth and very drinkable. The flavor is mainly chocolate and coffee, but it doesnt overpower the taste. It finishes with some earthy, nutty flavors leaving behind a coffee taste.
I found this to be a very drinkable stout whos flavor doesnt overpower the palate.","Anaheim, California, USA","anaheim1983"
621,"2006-02-19",3.9,"Old bottle from perhaps 2002 or earlier, Sampled February 2006
Pours with a frothy, reasonably fast disappearing, light brown colored head.  The beer shows a bright, clear deep brown color as I pour it, but otherwise sits an opaque black color in my glass.  Ah the aroma is quite nice, it has that characteristic note that develops in lightly oxidized stouts.  Heady notes of alcohol, espresso, rum, all intermingles a creates a note that is slightly reminiscent of a coffee liquor.

The taste is fairly light up front, it would seem this beer has thinned out a bit over time.  The finish has a solid dark chocolate note that lingers on with a bit of that characteristic chocolate bitterness.  I think that the light oxidation has accentuated the chocolate note in the finish.  This beer is lightly sweet throughout, which, serves as a great foil for the noticeable roasted character.  There is a certain burn acidity, which in combination with the roasted grain note reminds me of an espresso shot.

The dark malts in this beer have allowed it to stand up quite well over the years.  The oxidation while apparent is still at the stage where it adds a bit to the complexity, and I think that it makes up quite well for the smoothing out and loss of complexity in the up front malt notes that would have been in this beer originally.  I also really like the boosted chocolate notes in this beer, the finish reminds me of vibrant cocoa powder in both its chocolate note and its bitterness.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
621,"2006-01-22",3.8,"Bottle Pours a dense black color and a tan head that is not particularly thick or creamy.  Lovely chocolate and pitted fruit aroma. A littel sourness and plenty of sweet dark roasted notes as well.
Flavor shows off more of the coffee taste and the slightly swet smokiness that I expected.  Feel is moderate and slightly dry for the style.  There is that sour flavor here as well and the lingering trailer is here the classic charcoal and coffee hints are more prevelant.  Carbonation is quite lively.  Not as slick on the palate as I was expecting or hoping for but tasty anyway.  Thanks to Styles for sending this one my way.","Boise, Idaho, USA","IndianaRed"
621,"2006-01-20",4.2,"Formidable hiss as the cap comes off, pouring with moderate viscosity, opaque and black in color with a touch of lightening when put to light.  Wispy grey head with a complimentary rung around the corners.  Aroma is very much in tact.  Lactic chocolate and semi-sweet morsels melted on a dirty cookie sheet.  Touch of syrupy mochas and white chocolate covered raisins.  Coffee annotations resound most prominently in the flavor department.  Dry, bitter tract.  Sweetness comes in the form of dark chocolate Ghirardelli squares.  Some chocolate confectionary dust.  Dry, bitter-sweet palate serenade.  Not sure if its the age, but balance has achieve a perfect equilibrium.  Finish is laden with coffee grinds and cocoa powder with a bitter resonance at the outset.

They were deep tan colored, not solid at all, almost looked alive... they seemed to have dissappeared though about a minute after the pour. Theyve left me a little worried/confused as no one else has mentioned them, but the thing tastes fine (I think), so I guess its not infected. 

Taste is roasty, almost smokey, with a touch of coffee. Not seeing much in the way of oats or sweetness. A very slight touch of bitterness at the end though no noticable hop tastes. Tastes mostly like a porter, to me.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

Despite its age, mellow floral hops can be felt underneath the fruitiness, the latter reminding of blackberry and prune, but not quite in a vinous way.

Major chocolate and caramel tones with coffee, raisin, pecan, and oats. Sublime alcohol undertone detected by the nose as well. Taste was like biting into a bittersweet chocolate bar followed by a gulp of strong coffee. Chewy, creamy, lush mouthfeel, then dry lightly buttery finish. Hint of smoke in this one too, but not as strong as the forementioned stout. Once again, another quality stout from Bells, rate above Kzoo Stout and below Expedition and Double Cream.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
621,"2003-07-21",4.3,"Velvety smooth chocolate aroma with a coal black appearance.  Sports a mocha colored head - just a bit thin; but with good lacing. Coffee notes are prominent in the flavor with a bit of hoppy bitterness in the finish. Good thick creamy mouthfeel.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
621,"2003-06-27",4.0,"pours thick and black, beige head.  big aroma of coffee, roast and chocolate covered raisins.  lots of roast and mocha with a semi-tart almost port like mouthfeel.  roasty, bitter and slightly smoky finish.  very nice stout.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mrkimchee"
621,"2003-06-11",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 17, 2003 Pours dark and thick as expected.  Light caramel head.  Aroma of chocolate, cinamon and nuts.  Delicious. Beautiful aftertaste that keeps on evolving on your tongue.  Flavours of licorice and smoke.  The only question is ""should I eat it with a fork or a spoon?""","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
621,"2003-06-10",3.9,"Tan, creamy head.  Diminishing at a medium rate.  Black in color, light fights to get through the glass, but fails.  A little bit of a ruby hue.  Slightly roasty malt/chocolate aroma.  I'm not certain, but I think I can smell a fair amount of alcohol even though it's only at 5.7%.  Roasty coffee and oatmeal in the flavor, a little bitter/acidic, but I'm questioning if it comes from the hops or malts.  Another tastey concoction from Bells.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AustinMilbarge"
621,"2003-06-02",3.6,"Pungent coffee, molasses aroma that is slightly more restrained then the previous Bell's Stout that I tried. Monstrous foamy tan head. Pouring results in cascading effect; Beer is opaque black. Palate is slightly thin up front, more maltier at the end. Quite dry and not as sweet as I expected. Alcohol is present at the end, and detectable hops, resulting is a slight harshness. In my opinion not as enjoyable as the Kalamazoo Stout. Still satisfying and above average.","Calgary, Alberta, CANADA","TipsyMcStager"
621,"2003-05-04",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2003 Poured out of bottle, bought at Hopleaf bar in Chicago, 5/3/03.  Extremely roasty.  Light coffee/chocolate aroma.  Not much head, doesn't hold.  Dark brown body with a hint of redness.  Smooth and luscious texture, but not a strong opening flavor; however. . . the proof is in the finish-- amazingly long, very strong coffee flavor.  This beer is all about the finish, and it's nice to sit back and savor it, but don't look for much other excitement along the way.  High quality stout, but I've had others with more going on.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
621,"2003-03-29",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2003 Light aroma of a very heavy smell mixed with coffee and chocolate. My initial pour yielded a very small head of small dark brown bubbles that quickly disappeared. It's body was made up of a deep ruby red opaque color. My initial taste response was one of coffee and thick flavor. It went down somewhat smoothly but left behind a slight after bite. One of the better stouts I have had, but still not overly impressive.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
621,"2003-03-29",4.0,"Aroma is malt, coffee, hazelnut, and chocolate.  Dark, dark brown color with a decent dark brown head.  The first thing that jumps out in the flavor is a roasted character, followed by a smooth maltiness with notes of hazelnut and chocolate.  The balance is pretty close to even, neither bitter or sweet.  Very full body, almost chewy.  About what I expect of an oatmeal stout from a quality brewery.","Boone, North Carolina, USA","Brodie"
621,"2003-03-18",3.9,"I dont know that I would have picked this out from the typical stouts, not that it isnt good, just that it isnt especially distinctive.  I really did pick up oatmeal, along with a healthy dose of vanilla and hazelnut in the aroma.  The flavor is balanced, with oatmeal riding shotgun with that Bells all-around stout composition, roasted and smooth, not especially hoppy or bitter.  Gets a decent head, looks the part of a stout, and the flavors match.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
621,"2003-03-14",4.0,"Pours a jet black color with a lingering, small, tan head. Strong aroma of chocolate malts and oatmeal sweetness with a touch of roastiness in the background. Thick, rich, and velvety smooth, the flavor is all malts and oatmeal with hints of chocolate and a burnt bitterness in the finish. Creamy and delicious, this is an excellent oatmeal stout.","Greenville, South Carolina, USA","Uglyradio"
621,"2003-03-10",4.0,"Thick, black with lots of chunks … the appearance is a facsimile of good oatmeal itself.  Creamy, buttery head.  The aroma is similar to java mocha being brewed when you walk into a coffee house from the cold.  The aroma is belied by the first sip which contains loads (more than anticipated) roasted malts.  The texture has all the creaminess expected from an oatmeal, but there is a note of astringency that doesn’t fit.  This beer, however, deserves a good rating for its aroma alone.  A nice mid-winter brew.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Inveigler"
621,"2003-03-05",3.2,"A thin, overcarbonated and pretty much disappointing brew from such a wonderful brewery.  Pass me a Sam Smith anyday.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","MOboy"
621,"2003-02-21",3.8,"A nice, smooth stout.  The roasted flavors aren't as distinct in this one as they are in the other Bells stouts.  This one does have a nice smooth, creamy feel, however.  I would still suggest one of Bells regular stouts (Kalamazoo Stout or Double Cream Stout) over any of the November stouts.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
621,"2003-02-16",4.1,"lord.  these kalamazoo folk got stouts like b.b.'s got the blues.  they got a dandelion stout and a chittlin' and hambone stout and a toe jam mustard  stout--all of 'em about ten bucks a six pack!  this one's worth it. it's black. ordinary light knows well it's limitations and wisely just steps around this obsidian pour. i'd use a glass of this for viewing the next solar eclipse, but i imagine i'd miss the action. a blooming head of camel-suede color causes it to ace the 'appearance' category.  nutty aroma, baker's chocolate, straw broom and cantaloupe, all nicely configured. carbonation evolves to creaminess, it's full bodied, lightly sweet, darkened grains without being roasted, it's currants and unsweetened cocoa powder. good hop bitterness, and some slight chalkiness in the finish.  tho i can't  tell oatmeal from oyster shells generally,  this is a fine stout.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"
621,"2003-02-13",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2003 definately a pleasant suprise to see this on tap at old chicago in rockford, IL-this beer is the replacement for two hearted on their tap.  I ordered this brew with some hesitation since i didn't think the bells stout was that great.  This had a great aroma, taste was carmal and coffee malt all wraped up with some oats.  The finish lasted for a long time, especially when i left the place and the cold air got into the mix-ummmmmm!!!","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
621,"2003-02-05",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2003 This is a good stout, but as far as Bell's stouts go, its pretty average.  Dark color, brown/tan head, smells like roasted coffee, but not as much as the kalamazoo stout does.  The flavor is dark chocolate, oats, and a general presence of roastyness. Its worth a try, but if you havent tried their expedition or double cream stouts yet, I'd suggest giving them a try first.","Seattle, Washington, USA","AlabastorJones"
621,"2003-02-04",3.9,"A very dark beer, nice and think.  Full bodied without too much bite.  A much better value that Sam Smith's.","California, USA","bigbish"
621,"2003-01-31",3.4,"Very dark pour, medium  head, toasty aroma is light, almost hard to find. Full bodied yet quite smooth from start to finish, can't really fault it except to say that the flavors are a bit too subdued to make a lasting impression. A very decent stout but not the best.","Laguna Niguel, California, USA","elnadeau"
621,"2003-01-30",4.1,"Beautiful deep brown pour with a nice tan head.  Wonderful coffee, chocolate and toasted oat aroma and flavorings.  Not as good as the Bells Expedition stout, but a good runner up.","Lewis Center, Ohio, USA","bluemeow76"
621,"2003-01-26",3.9,"I missed reviewing this one, even though I have had a few of them before. This beer poured as black as sin and formed a light tan foamy head that left circular lace as it subsided. An aroma of malt, oats, burnt coffee and chocolate. A flavor of malt, burnt coffee and chocolate. It had a medium body and a slightly astrigent finish.","Ohio, USA","Gunshy"
621,"2003-01-19",4.2,"Pours black as night with a sweet roasted aroma with some nuttiness.  Great full-bodied flavor with a warming toasty finish.  This rivals St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout.  Another one of Bells' great beers.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
621,"2003-01-16",4.1,"Bell's doesn't have the most inspiring labeling, but it's what's inside that counts, right? Pours a deep dark brown with a medium and lasting beige head. Decent lacing. Aroma is very roasty with some oat smell too. The flavor is not as sweet and creamy as many Oatmeal Stouts, it was actually a little dry. Flavors of espresso, chocolate, and a little malt lent to a smooth finish. Very good.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
621,"2003-01-11",4.0,"Deep brown color, almost like expresso. Nice roaster flavor with a long finish. I will look for this again on the next trip back to MI.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Superstar"
621,"2003-01-06",3.9,"Bottle.  Black color with a touch of ruby at the corner.  An impressive foamy brown head.  A load of malts jump into the nose and sweetness lingers.  Bitter chocolate and some burnt character.","San Francisco, California, USA","jazz88"
621,"2003-01-06",3.4,"Solid in every way, but I cant find anything about it to distinguish it from the pack of bells stouts.  Smooth creamy mouthfeel, moderate hoppiness (more subdued than many of the other bells stouts) good balance between roast, chocolate and sweetness.  Good, but not distinguished.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"

Average density and easy to drink.  Roasted burnt aroma and flavor.  Tiny yeastiness, oat, vanilla and chocolate milk.  Smooth and slightly sweet. Coffee and toffee finish. Recommended.","California, USA","stephen"
621,"2002-11-30",4.7,"Oh man. This is perhaps the perfect example of my favorite kind of beer. Full oats and chocolate aroma. The flavor was very chocolaty...very sweet...like a creamy chocolate milk shake. I too, tasted a cashew-like nutty flavor which blended perfectly with the other flavors. Not really much bitterness here. This beer is all about the malty sweetness. Nice roasted character with its milk chocolate core, and oatmeal creaminess. Perfectly black color...thick tan head, and perfect carbonation.","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"
621,"2002-11-25",3.5,"Very dark brown w/ a 2 finger tan head. Some oats & cocoa in the nose. A bit more carbonated than I like, but it does have a nice smoothness about it.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"

621,"2002-11-21",3.8,"while the aroma of this beer is not overly powerful, it definitely has some malty notes with a coffe scent.  there is the faint smell of candy.  the flavor follows in the same manner.  a faint sweetness with a coffee malt flavor.  it is a very drinkable stout, and i dont usually enjoy stouts.  very good almost comparable to a guiness.","flint, Michigan, USA","hotbod47"

621,"2002-11-12",4.0,"A great oatie.  I found it very refreshing that this one wasnt all sugared up like Sammy Smith. This was the last November Stout I needed to try before I tried them all.

621,"2002-11-11",4.2,"Im not sure how I missed this one last year, but it wont happen again.  Phenomenal build to this stout, it feels layered in the mouth with each layer a bold assertion of dark goodness, from the full oat sweets to the roasted edges, from the rich nut (cashew) tones to the swift hop bitters on close.  Finishes dry like the effect of eating freshly shelled pecans.  Admirable stuff.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
621,"2002-11-10",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 18, 2003 Draft:  Traditional Bell""s rocky, dense, and sticky foam.  Lovely velvety bottle conditioned mouthfeel.  Gargantuan toasted peanut aroma blanketed by charcoal, cardboard, oats, gelatin, and some underlying mocha.  Full of chocolate, peanut, and graham.  Finishes both intensely roasty and burnt with bitter chocolate and a notable dryness.  The best American made Oatmeal Stout I have yet tasted.   November is the best month of the year!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

621,"2002-08-28",3.5,"This was the first sweet stout where I really noticed the sweetness of it.  Poured thick and dark, but not opaque.  Smelled of intense sweet chocolate.

Oily and just a little chewy, the moutfeel matches what Ive come to expect from this style.   Bells take on an Oatmeal Stout finishes with a bit of a hop bitter which is somewhat unusual.
