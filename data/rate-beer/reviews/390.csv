Flavour is fairly boozy, with white wine and light melon fruitiness. Not as good as the Junmai Nama, but still quite nice.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
390,"2014-08-30",3.2,"Bottle @ Artisan Sake. Clear off-white/pale yellow. Fumey. Alcohol, apple peels, grape, and rice milk. Slight licorice. Flavor is kind of assertive. Milky flavor, almost creamy.

390,"2011-02-08",3.6,"Tasted at the tasting room.  Bright fruity nose.  Fairly peppery aroma.  Quite a bit hotter than the Junmai Nama - there is a very arugula like peppery character.  Some light melon and a sort of asian pear flavour with an almost creamy sweet cherimoya like fruitiness.  Fuller palate with a bit of lingering spiciness.  A touch of softness on the back of the palate.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
390,"2010-12-23",2.7,"Flavour is sweet with a large alcohol finish. Very faint yellow body. i found this a little too strong and tasteless with just the alcohol showing through.","Alberta, CANADA","DeanF"
390,"2010-07-31",4.0,"Bottle at the breweryPale yellow color. The aroma is actually bolder than the watered version, featuring pear, melon, more alcohol and glue. Sweetish flavor, with bitter almonds. Pleasant alcohol warmth in the final.Good.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
390,"2010-02-08",2.7,"Bottle: Pours a yellowish beige color with light legs. The nose is full of cedar and lychee, some banana and a nice dose of koji. The impact is thick and sweet with a light medicinal and dusty finish in the mouthfeel. A bit cloying somewhat, but the acidity is pretty high to try to offset that so it doesnt taste it. Still comes through though. Very medicinal herbal finish with more of the cedar and dusty notes. I could have used something a little cleaner tasting, higher SMV and lower acidity. For the pros though; the alcohol is well hidden.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"

390,"2007-10-22",3.7,"Rice, pears, black pepper and lychee are apparent in the lightly smoky aroma.  Clear pale body is quite viscous and leaves beautiful legs on the glass.  Vanilla, rice, pears and bread are the predominant flavours with alcohol also quite notable.  Texture borders on syrupy but strong warming shows its strength and keeps it from cloying.  Bottle sampled at Wazubees in Summer 2007.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
390,"2007-01-20",3.4,"Gorgeous legs on this one.  Only the slightest bit of green to it.  Brawnier aroma than its stablemates, putting the accent on the woody, peppery alcohol with almost a whole grain bread note.  Rich, full flavour.  Full of bready, complex grains, hint of peaches.  Very dry, muscular.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
