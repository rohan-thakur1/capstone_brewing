A főzdénél az érlelésen túl remekül értenek a fűszerezéshez is, a kettő találkozása ezúttal sem meglepő módon mesteri módon valósult meg. A karamellás színezetű, alkoholban úszó fadongák mennyeien krémes, vaníliás-kókuszos karaktere viszi a prímet, a bársonyos kakaó édesen puha foszlányai simogatják jámboran a szerkezetet, majd a vibrálóan fűszeres körítés izgalmas jegyei korbácsolják fel a kedélyeket. Csakúgy, ahogyan az élénk kortyok karamelles, csokoládés, kakaós vonalait a jogosan elvárt vanília és kókusz faháncsos elemei vastagítják, majd továbbhaladva az ízek rejtelmeibe, némi füstös, dohánnyal kevert csípőspaprika sziporkázóan pikáns karaktere is feltárul végül. Nem az a szirupos fenevad, de nem is az a finomkodó, sejtelmes ízvilág; az ízjegyek bombaként robbannak, de nem tolakodóak; elegáns, de nem egysíkú; nem sok mindent leplez, mégsem faragatlan; tagadhatatlanul Lost Abbey, vérbeli american strong ale.","HUNGARY","adster"

Medium body, watery to oil texture, lively carbonation, finish is boozy, bourbon, flat. Good brew, but needs some improvements - first of all need some time to stay in the bottle for a while to hide the ABV. Carbonation is too high and in overall palate should be improved - thicker, fuller and not so annoying.

2669,"2016-02-11",4.2,"750ml bottlle acquired via trade on BA. Thanks, bro. A really fun beer that Im glad to have gotten. Pours a deeper, dark blackish brown hue, stout like in appeal. Dark and ominous, an opaque body with thicker legs on the swirl. Some brownish glow on the edges and bottom with frothy and alluring brownish creamy head atop. A full film with thicker ringer laces sufficiently. Aromas show firm barrel, vanilla and spirit mesh with chocolate, marshmellow and subtle coconut. Richer oak appeal is flavorful and deep as toasty and roasty malts support sweeter caramel base, biscuits and jabs of chocolate. Subtle spiciness, more oak but not an assault of heat or spirit. Dark and deep, rich with subtle brandy, firm whiskey and toast, vanilla and subtle marshmellow appeal. Nice stuff as that cinnamon gives just a subtle flourish, growing slowly as it warms and settles. Initial is fuller bodied overall, a good oaky presence softens the blow with tannic appeal, sufficient carbonation, caramel and toast, roast and subtle char meet gentle cocoa and chocolate. Softened tannic vanilla and softer creamy sweetness still lives on a bit despite the barrel time. A bit of warmth, caramel, rich oak and subtle vinous character grows. A bit of coconut, chocolate and subtle cinnamon as we start to round the corner. Sufficient body to hold up to the barrel but not lacking on influence from it. Earthiness, vinous, and some subtle leather and tobacco depth is fleeting but tucked between those richer oak and cocoa flavors, vanilla and gentle warmth. Subtle peppery life is earthy, dark fruit and rich flavors overall. A firmer body holds up but the flavors and additions add depth, complexity, potent flavors. A bit of stickiness gives it the feel of a beer that held up strong but still has a potent oak character. Subtle cinnamon, nibs and gentle spicy peppery appeal. Really enjoyable and expertly aged stuff. A pretty pour, potent deep nose, great flavors and flow. A true example of barrel aging and holding up a think. A rich barrel flavor, expert timing and a great subtle addition of spices. This one is full yet pretty drinkable, full of flavor, a good flow and just really great stuff, I think. Well done, Lost Abbey. This is a reminder of your past and all the expertise you have because of it.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
