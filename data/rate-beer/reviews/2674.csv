2674,"2017-05-29",3.8,"From notes. 12 oz bottle shared with Doug at his house on May 16. The pour is more of a mahogany color with a pretty decent clarity. There is a lighter tan head that falls quickly to a thin ring. The aroma is full of alcohol. There is a good coffee and chocolate behind that, almost like a decent mocha. There is a hint of barrel, but the whiskey just doesnt come through like I thought it would. The flavor is much of the same. Nice, distinct balances of coffee and chocolate with a light woodiness and a pretty strong whiskey toward the back end. This doesnt try to hide the alcohol at all. The mouth feel is lighter and clean with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly alcohol dominated finish. The chocolate and coffee do well, but they just need to take over the booze a bot. This was pretty decent.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
2674,"2017-05-27",4.2,"12 oz bottle with an indecipherable industrial time stamp. Brown-black brew has an immediately disappearing head. Aroma is toasted walnut, espresso, soy, toffee and a touch of booze that seems more red wine than whiskey. Tastes of caramel, salty roasted peanut, milk chocolate and whiskey. Long finish has some prune, red wine, beef broth and toasted barrel. Medium-heavy body has low carbonation and a drinkable balance for such a big brew. Tastes like a very nice quadrupel.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
2674,"2017-05-14",4.6,"Piana na 1cm, sycząca, po chwili pozostająca jedynie w formie firanki. Barwa ciemno brązowa, mętna.

Goryczka nieduża, tytoniowo orzechowa, na finiszu whiskey, rozgrzewanie, likierowość. Niskie, drobne wysycenie, w odbiorze lepkie, lekko oleiste, średnio gęste.

2674,"2016-12-02",4.4,"Kolor:  Ciemnobrunatny. Piwo jest słabo przejrzyste. 
 Piana: Kurde... Słabiuteńka. Ciemnokremowa, drobno oczkowa, nietrwała.
Szybko opadła do chmurki, a ta wkrótce do zera.
Na krawędziach Sniftera z trudem można odnaleźć punktowe kropeczki. 
 Zapach: Móglbym się nim narkotyzować dzień i noc. Tyle akcentów bourbonu w tak małym bączku. Intensywne nuty dębowej beczki, whisky, szlachetnego alkoholu, wzbogacone o nuty kokosowe i waniliowe.
Chyba w żadnym piwie nie będącym Imperialnym Stoutem nie czułem takiej intensywności tej beczki.
Pod spodem przykryte są nuty czekolady, kakao i odrobinę włoskich orzechów.
Kawy jest w aromacie niewiele, ale nie jest to dla mnie żaden problem. 
 Smak:  Po pierwszym łyku już wiem, że to jest Sztos!
Piwo jest tak gładkie, tak aksamitne na języku.
Beczkowa strona trunku jest bardzo wyraźna. Każda, nawet słabo zaznajomiona osoba w temacie piwa, bez najmniejszego trudu rozpozna tutaj akcenty whisky i bourbonu.
A jest ich tutaj ogrom! Podbija je posmak zbutwiałego, mokrego drewna i dużo wanilii i kokosu. Ten drugi jest tak wyraźny, że mam wrażenie, jakby ktoś mi Bounty rozpuścił w piwie. Jeszcze nigdy nie czułem tak mocnego kokosa.
Piwo bazowe pokozuje takie składowe jak: belgijska czekolada, orzechy włoskie, karmel, cukier trzcinowy.
Kawa jest raczej w typie słodkiego caffee latte. Mogłaby być bardziej wyraźna.
13% alkoholu? To musi być jakiś żart? Pomyłka! Nie może być!
W ślepym teście postawił bym na 7-8% obj.
Tekstura piwa jest bajeczna, jedwabista.
Piwo jest pełne w smaku, wykleja usta i podniebienie. Aftertaste jest długi, przyjemny, gładki.
Fenomenalne na skale światową! 
 Wysycenie.  Minimalne. Praktycznie zerowe. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Piłem już wiele piw leżakowanych w beczce po bourbonie.
Były to najczęściej RIS-y.
Tutaj beczka zrobiła takie spustoszenie, że chwilami zaburza nawet piwo bazowe.
Tak potężnego kokosu nie czułem w żadnym piwie.
Taka gładkość na języku, kremowość, jedwabiste odczucie w ustach.
Niespotykane na taką skalę.
Piwo rozpływa się w ustach, jak najlepsze belgijskie pralinki.
Kawa w aromacie jest słabo wyczuwalna, ale w smaku już robi robotę. Ma ona słodki posmak, jak caffee latte z odrobiną mleka.

Piwo zapamiętam na bardzo długo. Między innymi za najbardziej dominującą beczkę w piwie-nie-będącym-RIS-em.

2674,"2016-06-24",4.0,"13%ABV. American Strong Ale.

Poured out brown. 29ºSRM.

Nose is full of sweet candy nose that youd expect with a quad/abt with the extra smoky kick of an espresso roast. The smoke in the nose becomes more aggressive and even takes on the character of lightly smoked peat with smoke and earth. The nose at the end even has some fresh spicy notes.

Mouthfeel is syrupy. Palate is rounded with a broad based and gentle sour, like the sour in brown sugar. Other flavors are that of the sour of a freshly pulled espresso. The espresso impression continues into the finish which is flowery with light citrus.

Overall, the experience is like enjoying a great single origin espressor from Ethiopia, maybe a Yergachef.

Then caramel and nutty malts. Gets sweeter as it warms. Coffee is aggressive in the back end and cuts the sugars. Heavy and boozy. Took a while to work through this. A dessert beer in all respects, but a fine one at that.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
2674,"2016-01-14",3.9,"Pours a dark brown with a very thin white head. Aroma is coffee, roast, oak, and toffee. Flavor is heavier on the oak, with coffee and caramel. Hides the alcohol very well. Has a smooth body. A very solid strong ale.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","chucklemation"

2674,"2016-01-10",3.6,"The smell is COFFEE BEANS!!! Everything else is almost non-existent. Coffee brown color, the taste is malty, sweet, almost syrup sweet, with huge coffee notes and a bitter taste after the swallow. I havent had a beer like it. The ABV is intense, but not much burn for a 13%. Hefty price for such a small bottle, I cant recommend it for the average drinker but if you love coffee beers and strong ales, you will enjoy this one.","long beach, California, USA","Mrnoluv"

2674,"2016-01-03",4.0,"Craft Brewers, is there any beer style you wont infuse with coffee? Apparently not. And for that, you beautiful crazy bastards, I thank you. With Coffee Okie, Prairie has decided to put coffee in an... American Strong Ale? (Imperial) Brown Ale? I dunno. In any case, Coffee Okie gives you a noseful of fresh, fruity coffee roast. Theres also some oak, toasted malt, and sugary booze. Flavor has earthy woodsiness, caramel, and coffee. Prairie makes weird beers beautiful. Theyve sure done it with Coffee Okie.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"
2674,"2016-01-02",3.6,"Bottle. The pour is brown. The aroma is fantastic, rich coffee, subtle booze. The taste has nice coffee, but I get little whiskey. Good drinking, not great.

Fairly boozy and earthy, I don't like the coffee mixed with a brown as much as a stout but less intense would be better.
