3242,"2014-05-31",2.1,"Reviewed from notes.
I poured this into a chalice.
The appearance was a golden yellow color with a decent looking transparency about it. Carbonation rose at a rapid pace filling a one finger white foamy head that fizzled quickly. There was no lacing whatsoever.
The smell was vinous and slightly spicy leading to some floraly grassiness.
The taste was vinous and floral with a decent backing from the citrus.
On the palate, it sat about a medium with a fairly sessionable sort of quality about it. The carbonation is very harsh - a bit overly done for a tripel.
Overall, uh, I would say this is an over rated Tripel as it more wine-like than beer-like if anything. Most likely wont seek this one out again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

A rich tripel with a sour twist has aged well although in hindsight I would not have waited quite so long. I would be interested to see how a non-bretted version stacks up against other tripels as a benchmark.

Aroma / Appearance - The rich head is the color of aging newsprint. A light coppery base is bright underneath. Yeast, powdered sugar, candy canes, and fruit (specifically apples and lemons) sparkle like a sweet glaze.

Flavor / Palate - Yeast, powdered sugar, and lemon crisp tickle the tongue. A delayed blast of dry malts holds the profile together until the semisweet finish. Other than an odd taste of baby powder here or there this is a nice release. If not so spendy Id consider buying a few more Anchorage bottles.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3242,"2014-01-19",4.0,"750 ml bottle; batch 2 Nov 2012. This one only spent one month in my garage, so its a bit strange that garage, so a bit strange that it sat on the store shelves for so long. The result is that the brett has had full time to develop -- not necessarily a good thing for this particular style. 

Pours into my Koningshoeven goblet a beautiful orange-gold with a small and short-lived white head, microbubbles rising from the sides early but settling down soon enough. The aroma is absolutely divine - 9 or maybe even 10 - with a lot going on. Sweet oranges and moscato over chardonnay oak. Hints of grapefruit, mango nectar. And then the funk and must: the one moldy clementine going soft in the bottom of the fruit bowl. The flavor doesnt quite rise to the high bar set by the aroma, but its still good. A bit more sour than the aroma initially suggests, canned pineapple juice, Sorachi ace lemon, brett coming on hard late with bitter walnut husk and covering over residual sweetness in each sip, aided and abetted by a modest hit of grapefruit pith hops. Fascinating to try a brett-driven tripel and remarkably good -- Anchorage doesnt disappoint -- for what can only be seen as a bold experiment. Yet a tripel may not be the best match for the strong brett profile, and in the end the lacks the alchemy that of the Anchorage white IPA.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

3242,"2013-05-14",3.3,"A steady pour into my Teku glass produces a two-finger thick, pale, off-white colored head. The beer is a straw color that shows a bright, though hazed, light yellow-gold hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells of lemon like hops up front backed by cracker like pale malt and a touch of toasted, woody oak. The nose is actually fairly light, compared to what I was expecting, the hop character is definitely the most noticeable note here. Soft notes of spicy, hot, higher alcohols, light medicinal and clove like phenols, and a soft pear / melon like fruitiness are just noticeable once I start to dig around a bit.

Effervescent and fairly light bodied, the beer has just a touch of viscosity to it, but is quite quaffable. The hop character adds a nice lemon like quality, a definite bitter bite, a sort of pine / herbal character, and perhaps a touch of hay / grassy character; this last is accentuated by the pale malt character that has a soft, chewy cracker like note to it as well. The Brettanomyces character is still fairly light here, it has an oral / nasal effect that contributes softly antiseptic phenolic notes, some light mustiness, and perhaps a hint of funky, musky character (though only just). The oak character plays a supporting role here, but once you start to notice it, the oak character is quite present; woody, spicy, alcohol accentuating, and some soft vanillin notes are all contributed by the wood.

Not bad, but the oak character makes it a touch sharp and not quite as balanced as it could be; A bit of age might help this, but then it would lose the nicely vibrant hop character too. With the Brettanomyces (assuming it wasnt filtered out), this beer could change quite a bit with age, and perhaps for the better.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Aroma is a bit cheesy, yeasty, tart/lemony, and you can definitely perceive the brett and chardonnay-infused oak in there.  Some aromas remind me of a local brew we have here in Quebec Canada, Trou du Diables Dulcis Succubus (sour also with brett but aged in Sauternes wine barrels).  But the similarities end there as the latter also has heavy fruity and leathery aromas.  Taste is medium sour with some malty sweetness to balance it of (and balanced it is).  Body is medium-light, texture is a bit thinner than I had expected for such a brew though.  Carbonation is fizzy, quite enjoyable.  Finish is very slightly bitter and you can definitely feel the oak there.  Overall, this is a pretty unique brew (IMO alas)!  Not my favorite type or favorite from Anchorage (had their Galaxy IPA too and like it better), but I would buy again - but share it with a friend.

3242,"2012-10-06",4.1,"Pours a hazy, pale golden orange color with a one finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Decent retention with streaks of soapy lacing left behind. 

The aroma of this beer is pretty complex with hints of earthy hops, sweet citrus, oak barrel and funky wild yeast notes bouncing off of each other. The barrel presence is prominent with toasted oak, vanilla, spice and white wine notes followed by vinous and tropical fruit, resinous pine and musty funk. As it warms, the wild yeast comes to the forefront with musty brett and a subtle lactic character that compliments the hop profile. The Chardonnay/white wine notes are also pretty strong with grape must and other light fruit notes. This slightly overpowers the hop profile but there are still hints of pine needle and tropical fruit. 

On the fuller end of medium bodied with soft carbonation and a prominent barrel presence that adds complexity without interfering with the hops and wild yeast notes. Some charred oak along with vanilla and buttery white wine flavor which is countered by a dry, bitter pine presence and a strong, musty brett character. The wild yeast provides some dry, earthy funk that compliments the resinous hop flavor and gives balance to the tropical and vinous fruit sweetness. Underneath the barrel and wild yeast, there are hints of citrus peel, apple, pear and alcohol but the high ABV is well masked making this complex beer pretty quaffable. There is a lot going on here but the wine barrel, earthy hops and funky yeast notes are almost perfectly balanced resulting in another excellent beer from this brewery.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

I cant find a better word than high-pitched to describe the aroma, explosive and going everywhere, but not doing too much of anything and thus maintaining a certain sense of balance, albeit one that can go overboard at any moment. Fairly strong white wine character, with buttery, vanilla and tart notions. Slightly vegetal (onion?). The palate is dry, a feeling perhaps diminished by the oily chardonnay and concealing its 9% ABV with an undeniable competence. If the large bubbles feel agressive enough initially,. they quickly settle down to a more diplomatic level. Leathery, coniferous, wild finish with plasticy and medicinal phenolic notes aplenty, but a certain charm in the sheer aromatic intensity.

3242,"2012-07-21",3.8,"My Bottom Line :  
White wine, brettanomyces and a dry wooden character meld into honeyed malts and an overtly floral bouquet in this inspired Barrel-Aged Wild Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A sizeable head of foam stays atop the misty blond.
-Alcohol provides warmth in the back of each sip. 
-Mouthfeel is lean and bubbly, but perhaps not as tight and fluffy as other Anchorage brews Ive had.
-The Chardonnay character is quite prominent.

3242,"2012-06-11",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 12, 2013 Poured from a corked and caged 750ml bottle into a Duvel tulip, bottled October 2011.

A: Crystal clear golden amber with an thick and fast stream of fine carbonation bubbles floating to the thick rocky white head with excellent retention. This is an excellent looking beer, it wants to be drank!

S: I dont even know where to begin with this beer in the aroma. Chardonnay and oak come mildly through with a lemon zest from the Sorachi hops, but the Brett is also very prominent here giving a bright leathery funk to this. This is a bright smelling beer with a lot going on, I absolutely love this!

T: Upfront a slightly sweet flavor presents itself thats hard to discern before the combination of Brett, Sorachi hops, and the oaked chardonnay come in. Boy this is a lot to take in. Im picking up lemon, oak, leather and slight pepper in the mid-taste while the finish is hinting strongly at chardonnay with some banana and cloves. This is a party in my mouth.

M: Clean medium body with light carbonation, this glides over the tongue and down the throat.

O: I am in love. This is my favorite beer brewed with Brett. The description sounded a bit intimidating but the combination works together to make a bright slightly funky beer that is beautiful in looks and too easy to drink.
Cellar Review: Batch #1, October 2011.
Appearance: The body is hazy with a straw color, almost reminiscent of a mimosa. The head is tall and white with decent retention, settling into a light coating.
Aroma: This is complex and intense with huge fruity notes. The tripel side is showing bubblegum, banana and even some strawberry, that is complimented by hints of oak and white wine from the barrel aging and becomes even more complex by aromas of hay, tart lemon, and mild funk. Holy cow.
Taste: Holy shit, this is fucking delicious. The intro is mildly tart with lemon that is quickly matched by sweet malts and banana, this intro leads into a banana prominent mid-taste with overlying chardonnay notes and subtle peppery and cloves spice. The finish becomes hay like with mild funk and a slight tartness with a spicy finish that lingers.
Palate: Medium bodied with high carbonation.
Overall: This is even better than when I originally had this. This is a damn near perfect beer and the only beer I have ever considered giving a 5 to once I passed my ""green"" phase. This is complex with everything in perfect harmonious balance. Fucking delicious doesnt even begin to describe how good this is.

3242,"2012-05-21",4.3,"750ml bottle, Batch #1 from October 2011.  I dont like many tripels, but I have a feeling Gabe Fletcher probably knocked this out of the park.  The pour yields an ultra-cloudy, glowing, dusky golden-amber body thats strewn with limitless pinpoint carbonation.  A tall and moderately dense head of steadfast, cream tinted foam leaves patchy flares of lacing all over the glass.  The nose is exceptional, showing a soft and fresh base of creamy, pale cereal thats about as well attenuated as a 9% beer can be.  Hops are complex and perfectly married to the malt base, showing lemon pith, sweet rind, and tropical pineapple.  Buggy, brett-laden wood imparts notes of dust, white pepper, and creamy Chardonnay.  Hot damn, this smells just about perfect.  Flavors are right in line, running the gamut from creamy pale malt to assertive, lemony, citrus-driven hops and dusty, peppery, fruit and brett-kissed wood.  The ""lemon cream pie"" bottle descriptor isnt far off, as the creaminess really moves to the forefront at points, but it ultimately finishes dry and dusty like a proper brett beer should.  Close your eyes and you get bold notes of creamy, oaky, Napa Chard. The palate is substantive, creamy (I feel like Im over using that word...but its quite applicable here), well carbonated, and drying on the finish.  Damn fine beer.  This is arguably the best tripel Ive had to date (edging out another Gabe Fletcher creation  Midnight Sun Jupiter).  Exceptional.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

The nose is dusty oak, florals, musk, lemon peel - but its done really impressively for me. The flavor profile shares those elements but the brett comes through more dominantly; you get the hint of vinousness, perhaps ; and it finishes on the somewhat dry side, with a tingling sensation near the finish from the carbonation, combined with the light bitterness from the rest of it.

3242,"2012-04-15",3.5,"750ml bottle.  Pours a slightly hazy golden yellow with a medium creamy white head that retains well and laces the glass.

The aroma is brett and soft oak with some sweet malts and a little Belgian yeast.

The flavor is sweet fruity malts with oak and brett and some musty yeast.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with slightly sharp carbonation.

Overall, an OK beer - probably my least favorite by them.  I like the brett, but its a bit sweet and I dont think it plays well the the Belgian yeast.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"

3242,"2012-04-14",3.8,"750ml bottle purchased at wlv... pours a hazy yet solid orangey muted brown hue and topped with a hefty 2 finger white foamy head that fairly reduces to a frothy white film... aroma has soft dustings of brett, grass, and white wine accents and pineapple to a lesser extent. the brett has a pretty firm hold but there is a sense of airiness throughout.  more grass and a light bitterness towards the middle and backend. the tripel in itself is well-hidden although there is a subtle sweetness that surfaces... flavors are a continuation of the same.  bretty, dust and earth, tropical fruit and oranges with a light bitterness coming through late and extending on through the finish.  body has a fluffiness to it, airy, and not weighed down by the base beer.  slightly tartness works its way into the equation before drying out quickly.  a little warmth on the backend but not distracting... nicely executed brew but most of these anchorage brews seem to abide by a similar utilization of brett and white wine barrels.  would like to see a little more variety.  that being said, ill continue to taste these.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

3242,"2012-03-30",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2012 This is the fourth beer Ive now had from this brewer and I continue to be impressed.  This one pours a golden-orange color with a thick lasting foam on top.  The aroma is bretty and fruity; oranges, and lemons coming to mind.  Theres a hay-like horsey scent that is joined by heavy notes of white wine and oak.  The alcohol in this isnt completely hidden but even at 9% the body is velvety and silky smooth.  Oak and a white wine character mix with tropical fruit flavors of banana and mango.  Lots of brett here; funky, dry, and slightly tart.  Excellent stuff.  It doesnt necessarily come across being as complex as some of their others, say Bitter Monk IPA.  Im also starting to pick up a common denominator with most of their offerings, but if its going to be this good, Im not sure I care.

I also detect some hints of celery seed as well.  The aroma on this is pretty good, but judging from it, I would be more inclined to call this a sour/wild ale than a tripel.  Mildly hazy golden blonde body with a smallish, spritzy off-yellow head, which is fairly strong and persistent.  Really swell legging and lacing.  The start is a bit acetic, astringent, with Barnyardy Brett tartness.  This does not dominate, though.  The base beer really comes through in the end, with a sticky, almost sugary honey-like flavor present.  Chewy mouthfeel later on, which balances the Brett tartness.  This is well-balanced, and more enjoyable than I expected.  After tasting this, I would call this a tripel after all.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

Vanilla, sweet grains, malt sweetness, and a touch of hop bitterness.  Some botanicals and an herbal earthiness.  A bit drying from the yeast with funky, musky brett tones.

3242,"2012-01-29",3.8,"Bottle (Batch 1 Oct 2011). From my bottles description on the back, this seems to be a DFH collaboration (description and signature from Sam). I think this one needs a bit more time (havent said that about any of the Anchorage beers yet). Pours with a lightly hazed golden hued body with a large and lasting, fluffy white head. Aromas are very floral, rose water, tangerine, watermelon, brett, white wine grapes, allspice and ginger. Some lemon peel and lightly earthy. Flavors show a lemony zest, mild acidity, medium to high alcohol, dry white wine, mild funk. Grassy. Also a young brett character (cheerios), that I havent seen in the other Anchorage beers. While I like the dry hop character, this cheerio character needs to age out, and is very distracting for me. My main, if only knock to this beer. It is light in character, and seems to be nearly aged out. Very mild astringency as well that could be alcohol related. Lively bubbles, warming and dry with lively bubbles and a light body. While one of my least favorite Anchorage beers at the moment, this example just reaffirms my views that this brewery is the best new brewery (bar none) of 2011, and a serious player. Despite being mildly disappointed, this is still an amazingly stellar beer!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

Lovely crisp brett aroma, with some oak, and wine, as well. Dough, and yeast seem to hit my olfactories. This isnt completely dominated by the brett, which a lot of their beers seem to be. This has a nice rich texture, at first, and then it things out, and dries up a bit. Slightly fruity, with oak, dough, yeast, sugar, and of course, brett. I like this twist on a Tripel.
