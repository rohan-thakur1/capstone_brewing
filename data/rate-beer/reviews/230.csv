230,"2017-06-09",3.5,"Draft to taster at Cincy beerfest2017 pour avg gold with moderate white head. Nose peach and light grain. Taste big peach, stone fruit, bit mostly peach. Peach candy and cobbler with a little grain.","Loveland, Ohio, USA","drsordr"
230,"2017-06-04",3.1,"Pours clear golden with a frothy eggshell head. Aroma presents a strong note of sweet peach - and I love peaches. Hints of malt and hops peep through. Flavor starts with sweet peach and then brings fruity tartness, zesty malt and a little resiny hops. Mouthfeel offers decent body and OK fizz. What a peach.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
230,"2017-05-24",3.3,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2017 From a bomber. Pours almost clear gold with a bubbly off white head. Tastes like sweet peach, yeast, tart grapefruit, lemon, and cracker malt. Light body and low/medium carbonation. Smells like peach, yeast, grassy malt, straw, and faint citrus.","baltimore, Maryland, USA","snoworsummer"
230,"2017-05-24",2.8,"Bomber. Pours mostly clear gold. Aroma and flavor are cereal and bready malts, peaches, floral notes, and faint acidity. Light/medium body.","Federal Hill, Baltimore, Maryland, USA","sonnycheeba"

230,"2017-05-21",3.5,"Pours clear gold into a shaker. Bright white head with little retention recedes to hug rim. Peach aromas. Tart with peach and aspirin upfront turning to mild earth in the medium length finish.","Marblehead, Massachusetts, USA","thornecb"
230,"2017-05-20",3.6,"Draught from stomping ground. Poured a nice orange Amber. Pretty fruity hit, clean and cold. Great warm weather brew","New York, USA","Maverick34"
230,"2017-05-10",3.7,"Bomber. Pours a golden yellow color with a finger of fluffed white head. Fair bits of sticky lacing throughout. Aroma is light grass, yeast, and a little peach. Peach adds to the flavor, a nice crisp sweet tart vibe, but it compliments rather than detracts from the grassy bready base. It was a long day, I got stuck in traffic for a perceived eternity, this really hit the spot.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
230,"2017-05-09",3.5,"This isnt really as good as the original California Kolsch, I dont think the tart peach adds anything. It still pours clear yellow/orange with a average to sligght head. The aroma is still malty and floral, but the tart peach notes are there. Maybe a bit too much. It seems like artificial flavoring. It works a little better in the flavor. Slightly malty, slightly grassy, and the peach is slightly tart as promised. But I liked the original California Kolsch better, and found it more surprising.","Virginia, USA","Darwenus"
230,"2017-05-08",2.4,"Draught at Canary Square, 4/1/17.Minimally hazy, rosy-peach body is topped by a small, off-white head of moderate to low retention.Tart fruit acidity in the nose gives way to little else...maybe some cracker, light vanilla and...I dont know, salinity? Its mostly just peach juice.Tart peach juice, very well-attenuated mixes with grain character, very little body and peppery carbonation. Very under-malted, even for kolsch standards and its horribly dominated by the overly dry, almost lactic-like peach character. Why in the world would you add peach to your kolsch?","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
230,"2017-05-07",4.1,"22 ounce bottle into pint glass, bottled on 3/23/2017. Pours fairly crystal clear medium golden/yellow color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big sweet/tart/tangy peaches, lemon, pear, apple, honey, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance of peaches, pale malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of big sweet/tart/tangy peaches, lemon, pear, apple, honey, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, light pepper, and yeast earthiness. Light-moderate fruit tartness and light herbal/grassy/spicy bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tart/tangy peaches, lemon, pear, apple, honey, cracker, bread, herbal, floral, grass, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of peaches, pale malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; with a great malt/tart/bitterness balance, and zero astringent flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from tartness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp, fairly bready/grainy/acidic, and lightly sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 5.2%. Overall this is an awesome fruited Kolsch style. All around great robustness and balance of peaches, pale malt, earthy hops, and fruity yeast flavors; very smooth, crisp, clean, and refreshing to drink with the moderately tart/acidic/drying finish. The peaches definitely amp up the flavor intensity and dryness of the beer; but it still has great balance, and resembles the base style very well. Very vibrant and juicy on fruit flavors. A really delicious offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
230,"2017-05-06",3.7,"Bomber poured a clear gold with a lasting creamy white head. Aromas of bread, peach and light yeast. Palate was light bodied and crisp with a smooth dry lightly tart finish. Flavors of bread, peach and light yeast with a smooth dry lightly tart lingering peach finish.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
230,"2017-05-04",3.7,"Slightly hazy light orange/gold with nice dense white head. Huge peach aroma. Peach also dominates the flavor, though more like the taste one gets from sucking on the peach pit rather than biting into the juicy flesh. The finish is kind of a battle between tartness and bitterness.","Windsor, California, USA","DavidWoodruff"
230,"2017-05-02",3.5,"Draft. Clear deep golden color medium white head. Huge peach aroma. Taste is fruity, scant bitterness.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
230,"2017-05-01",3.6,"Sample at the Long Beach tasting room. Clear orange-gold color with a medium white head that recedes gradually to an outer ring. Short strings of lacing. The aroma is peaches, yeast and malt. Light to medium body with flavors of fresh peach, grassy hops and doughy malt. The finish is fruity with a peach and yeast aftertaste. Decent overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

230,"2017-04-27",3.5,"22floz bottle, no freshness date found, 5.2%, paid $5, poured into a pint glass. It has a really good clear golden appearance and lacing occurs, but smells like canned peaches with some skunk. Light-bodied palate with an appropriate amount of peach flavor that finishes bready. Not too shabby for a beer incorporating peach, all the while holding up to its base style.","","balloonbuffoon"
230,"2017-04-27",3.8,"aroma is all peach. flavor is light peach, salty, and a little wheaty. nicely balanced and the peach really is good. best kolsch i have had. pours light yellow with a white head. had at jerrys.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Christpuncher"

230,"2017-04-21",3.5,"Strong peach nose, yeasty overtones. Hazy amber, thin head. Tastes as it smells, with some added woodiness. Light body, easy carbonation. Tart and tangy, simple, very refreshing and fruity. Fruit is obviously the dominant characteristic here, with no resemblance to a kolsch. Should be classified as fruit beer.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"
230,"2017-04-19",3.3,"Bottle from Safeway in Redwood City, CA. Aroma is peaches. Taste is much more mild, earthy dry peach flavor. Crisp, fizzy tart, with some peach, and dry white wine notes. Better than expected (for a Kolsch) but was torn on this one. Didnt feel like it had enough malt to carry the Kolsch base beer and could have use a bit more malt or fruit sweetness to give it more depth.","Redwood City, California, USA","tightslice"
230,"2017-04-16",3.6,"Bomber. Sweet peach aroma with very light biscuity malt and grassy hops. Pours clear orange golden colored with a thin white head that has little retention or lacing. Starts with sweet peach and a hint of biscuity malt flavor. Finishes smooth and peachy tart with a slight grassy hop note faintly detectable. Clean and refreshing.","","zoucrew102"

Palate is dry and no lingering aftertaste. This is a fantastic beer on such a nice sunny spring day.","West Sacramento, California, USA","thetmaxx"
230,"2017-04-09",3.1,"On tap in Greenville SC in a Gouden Carolus glass. 

Clear golden body with a weak, bubbly white head. 
Aroma: strong for style. Fruit notes and baked bread. 
Flavor: as the aroma suggests, this is bold for style, apparently due to a generous malt load. Typical mild bitterness for style. 

Feel: the body is light+; medium-light carbonation. 

Overall: flavorful and refreshing kolsch.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
230,"2017-04-08",2.4,"Pours up clear gold, with a healthy white head. Aroma is all fresh peaches. Taste is also peaches, but seems to be all about the tartness here. It is overbearing with a vinegary, cheap wine flavor.","North Carolina, USA","HourGlass13"
230,"2017-04-08",2.3,"Bright fresh peach aroma is dominant. Pours lightly hazy deep yellow with a wispy scattered white head. The tartness here is overbearing for me. Somewhat vinegary. Still very peachy, but the sour fade is too much. The base beer is completely covered up.","Thomasville, North Carolina, USA","freekyp"
