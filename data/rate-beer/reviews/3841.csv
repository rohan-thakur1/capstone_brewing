3841,"2017-01-31",4.2,"750ml bottle acquired via adnielsen. Thanks as always, Niels. Had high hopes for this after the original. A glowing yellow sunshine hue with large bright white cakey head. Great retention and lacing, decent haziness in the body doesnt detract from the color. Aromas show tart and rustic life, white grape, pineapple, cobwebs and oak. A bit of eatery fruit, bitter earth, florals, grapefruit zest. Yogurt, lemon, zesty appeal. Very nice. Initial is sour and punchy, potent grapefruit, lemon, lime and ruby red appeal. Sour grapes, subtle grainy malt. Bitterness, punchy fuzzy sour appeal. Pineapple, cobwebs, bitter earth, subtle oak, funk. Refreshing sour stuff, bitter and pithy. Delicious stuff with a pleasant nose, pretty pour, light and lively flavor. Yum.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

3841,"2016-12-20",4.6,"Hazy light golden under a thin foamy white cap. Bright leafy and dry hopped perfumey hop resins on the nose thats a little earthy and funky. Full crisp flavor thats leafy and dry hopped with a lovely fresh resinous twang, light funk and a pleasant and bright sour tone. Bright floral and herbal hop tones atop a bright light Saison funky sourness. Really amazing.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
3841,"2016-11-07",4.2,"750 ml bottle shared, purchased at Mile High Wine & Spirits for $18.99. Light hazy yellow appearance with a small white head. Aroma of fresh hops, light earthy yeast and some funky sour notes. Similar flavor, adding zesty hops and tropical fruits with mild bitterness and mild sourness. Light to medium body with a crisp feel. Juicy, clean and refreshing overall.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
3841,"2016-09-19",4.3,"750 mL bottle. Bottled 4/7/15. Hazy golden with a medium white head. Smells of citrus hops. A little fruity and wine-like. Oak. Nice. Tastes of grassy and grapefruit citrus. Again a bit of wine before oak kicks in. Citrus lingers into the back end with a resiny flavor. Medium body. Well carbonated. Delicious.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3841,"2016-09-15",4.3,"Bottle. Big thanks to OKBeerFan for this one! It pours a light hazed pale yellow color with a white head. The aroma has lemony funk with some crackers and hay. The flavor is amazing with perfect levels of barnyard/lemony funk and light crackery, creamy malts. Nice strong tartness and the funk warms and complicates the finish. This is pretty much exactly what Im looking for in a mixed fermentation barrel aged farmhouse ale. Spectacular.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3841,"2016-09-09",4.2,"Bottle thanks to Russell. Pours a cloudy yellow gold with medium frothy white head that lasts. The aroma is strong oak, funk, orange peel, lemon. Funky, citrus, oak, nice tartness, very nice.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
3841,"2016-08-29",4.1,"Bottle thanks to Nielsen ! Pours a hazy yellow golden color with two fingers of gaseous foam. Nose is nice blend of fieldgrain with hints of stonefruit, citrus vanilla and some underlying keffir lime and barnyard funk. Palate follows with some nice juicy citrus notes, unripe nectarine, foggy grain and a hint of bitterness that creeps up along with some slight musty barnyard funk. Tasty !","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"

3841,"2016-07-27",3.9,"CO Cascade Dry-Hopped according to the sticker, bottled 4/7/15. Clear gold, small head, decent strands of lacing. Digging this more than the regular saison. Reasonably dry and light bodied. Tart, citrus, cheese, a little bit of funk, just enough sweetness up front to keep it in check. A different beast than the straight saison, and a very nice beer.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
3841,"2016-07-22",3.7,"Bomber thanks to Prufrockstar - questions as to which one to rate. This was bottled on 4/7/2015 as CO Cascade Hops. Saison-y and tart. Almost salty. Grassy and wild. Makes my nose sweat.","Taylor Mill, Kentucky, USA","Chudwick"
3841,"2016-06-19",4.1,"750 ml bottle thanks to wchesser. Light yellow in color. Nose is powerful. Lemon then followed by tropical fruit. Tartness. I guess I do get more citrus that then regular. Good stuff.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"

3841,"2016-06-13",4.2,"Cloudy lemon yellow color. Nose is green and slightly vegetal hops, with some light orange and pine citrus, with limestone minerality, and some funk. Taste follows, quite funky and tart, with some light lemon. Very different from what I remember of the straight saison.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"
