Body is lightly sweet, sugar, candied rice. I can manage but it is far from an exciting sake given my limited experience. My experience with sake is very limited & I am fairly certain that I cannot get the good stuff. At least it is appearantly a style tick.Nice classical Japanese label.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

The naked taste of it was kind of rough to me but that could be that I just dont like the taste or smell of strong alcohol. Hence today I mixed some with citrus and it is wonderful.

3586,"2011-12-31",3.3,"300mL bottle, gold foil, white label.  Clear, color of vegetable oil, off-yellow.  Spotty with oily legs.  Floral nose, smells of clean rice.  Tastes is soft, slight sweetness, not overbearingly sweet.  Simple character, still very intriguing to the point you become curious of the next sip.  Light sweetness is so good.  Perfect balance, very smooth.  Finishes with a touch of coconut and expected melon.  Overall, drinkable.  Happy New Year.

3586,"2011-08-19",3.7,"I just now found out that I could have been reviewing sakes on ratebeer. Well, this is the primary sake I order at a local sushi and ramen house. Its one of the more affordable bottles while still having a pure quality about it. This one also tends to get me more buzzing then when we order the generic unknown sake served hot in a Japanese tea pot. I much prefer my sake cold anyways, it just taste so much smoother.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"
3586,"2011-07-25",3.5,"pours a ever-so-slightly yellow tinted clear. still.  subtle nose, a bit of ricey, custardy sweetness with touches of tartness around the edges.  Very balanced and drinkable sake...somewhat sweet but certainly not overly so.  Not complex by any means, but it does have an interesting drinkability and balance...theres some sweet melon characteristics but they dont really jump out of you....the alcohol is warming but doesnt confuse the balanced flavors much...I give it props for being surprisingly balanced and unassuming with a very nice level of drinkability, even if it doesnt intrigue me much with complexity.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
3586,"2011-07-11",3.4,"Gift from Sj. Probably one of the better sakes or Im just starting to get use to the flavors. This one had a hint of fruit, vegatable and yeast. A nice candy smell with a sweet finish.

3586,"2011-04-04",3.5,"Tasted @ Red Sun, Bergen. Pours a sake-yellow-looking body. Aroma is really nice, but hard to describe for someone that has little experience rating sake.

I quite like sake, and this was nice.","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Medium bodied and an almost oily mouthfeel.  Flavors dont live up to the nose, but still relatively inoffensive, and smooth throughout.  Rice water, sweet and silky.  A bit hot on the finish moving toward more isopropyl and warm banana esters.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

3586,"2008-02-28",3.8,"300 ml bottle from City Market in Burlington, VT (February 2008), sampled out of the fridge from a Face Cachee de la Pomme glass.  Utterly clear, probably the clearest sake Ive had yet -- really impossible to tell apart from water aside from a very faint oiliness to the surface....legs are quite faint, nearly indistinct, and dont last.....subtle but quite pleasing aroma of nuts and bubblegum, coconut and perhaps just a hint of sweet cherry....the body is much drier than most sakes that Ive had; dont know if this is characteristic of tokubetsu as I believe this is my first, but its reminiscent of a dry Riesling, earthy and lightly alcoholic/sharp towards the finish, with little fruitiness and more than a hint of nuts....full and quite smooth, with a nice light tingly sharpness that comes in with a touch of warmth.  Fascinating, and perhaps the most complex and hard to describe sake Ive had yet.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
3586,"2008-02-24",3.5,"Sample from a Sake Flight at Fuji Jade Garden, State College, PA. Aroma carries a stronger pungent run of almonds and light grain. Distinct yeast signature. Pours clear. Alcohol arrives quickly on the palate. Strong, yet with fortitude. Brief in a quick, parsing blast of mid-fruits, grain alcohols, and jelly. Plums dominate the background. Decent, but a little scathing.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3586,"2008-01-07",3.5,"Virtually transparant, hint at very pale yellow. Nose like ever so lightly smoked grain. Alcohol obvious in the nose already. Almonds, lytchees, and other delicate fruit left in clear alcohol. Taste is alcoholic with a strange mix of oxydized grain, almond & lytchees again (if nowhere as sweet or as perfumed as a lytchee) - maybe cherimoya fruit. Alcoholwarming after a certain lapse of time. Gives an impression of lightness, but that is deceiving. Alcoholic, and maybe a tad too restrained sake.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
3586,"2006-11-08",2.6,"Clear, colorless sake. Mostly koji with a touch of licorice in the nose. Mild nutty flavor but also strong alcohol, unimpressive. Had both chilled and warm, didnt care for it much either way.","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"

3586,"2006-04-02",4.0,"Pretty fragrant aroma with a hint of sweetness. It had a very smooth and full bodied taste at room temperature. Sweet and just a tiny little bit of burn aftertaste, but overall one of the best o-sake that Ive had. Very highly recommended!","USA","furuyamasan"
3586,"2005-12-30",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 2, 2006 300mL Bottle from Sakura, Eagle, ID: Faint greenish yellow, which is a good sign, not too heavily charcoal filtered. The aroma is complex and full, very lively and complex. Not overly clean, which isnt always a bad thing; has a good up front nose. Pine, mint, caramel corn, bubblegum. The flavor is balanced with a similar impact in the mouth; high acidity. Creamy melon and chewy brazil nuts. A light alcohol feel; a bit harsh and earthy in the finish. Overall its a nice fresh and flavorful tokubetsu. I like the nihonshudo to be right around this range. Warmed: The high acidity just accentuated the alcohol evaporation and came across caustic. Not recommended warmed.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3586,"2005-10-10",4.2,"Bottle from Umajimaya, PDX.  Pours a just yellowish of clear color.  Still.  Aroma is fascinating.  Almost like Junior Mints.  Sweet, completely lacking the rough alcohol of other styles of sake.  Flavor is sweetish, very easy to drink, light rice just enough alcohol to remind you that this is potent.  Really quite a nice sake, one to give a sake newbie such as myself.","Alabama, USA","11026"
