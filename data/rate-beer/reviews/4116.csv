4116,"2016-11-13",3.9,"This one has that same odd aroma as the last one, almost balsamic. Very odd. Thankfully tastes so much better. Ripe raspberry, very tart, very full flavored and delicious. The finish lingers on the tongue, very acidic, even a bit tongue puckering tannin too. Very yummy mead, but the aroma and finish arent for me.","","BrandNewBrew"

Taste is very sweet, fruity and tart.

4116,"2016-10-15",4.3,"Bottle bought through Hackobock. Pours deep ruby red leaving some nice-looking legs on the glass with a swirl. Smell is heavy fruity with honey, raspberries, blackberries, bilberries, dark grapes, black currants, moist wood, vanilla, minerals, port wine and alcohol. Taste is slightly sweet, sour, heavy fruity and slightly woody. Mouthfeel is round, viscous, oily, tiny dry, tart, slightly boozy and near full bodied. Finish is tiny sweet and sour with extremely rich and complex berry and port characteristics. Amazingly complex sipper. As with its brother its very fun to see this level of complexity reached without insane sweetness levels. The price point is crazy steep but I guess thats fair with such a high end product.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"
