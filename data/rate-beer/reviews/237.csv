237,"2016-09-06",3.5,"On tap @ Stone Corral. This one actually was a pleasant surprise to me. Hazed yellow-gold beer with a white head. Its definitely sweeter than Id normally want from a Kolsch, but it was a pleasant enough beer overall. Fair amount of bread, a touch of honey, and some biscuit dough. Theres a light floral and grassy hop profile, as well as some apple esters. Slight bitterness on the finish. Its fine enough.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

237,"2016-02-21",4.0,"Smells of sweet fruit and floral scent. In my opinion piss yellow color is the best. Taste of slightly wooded flavor followed by a heaping helping of lemongrass. Light body super crisp carbonation. Nice brwe.","milton, Vermont, USA","polo_marco"
237,"2016-02-09",3.6,"Bottle shared in NYC with Chris. Pours hazy yellow-gold with a thick, creamy white head. The nose holds simple doughy malts, white bread, biscuit. Light to medium sweet flavor with pleasant sugary pale biscuits, lemon meringue, very slight bitter hay. Light bodied with average carbonation. Finishes with more simple doughy biscuits, white bread crusts, more meringue, straw. A nicely rounded kolsch. Goes down easy.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
237,"2015-09-07",3.5,"From 22oz bottle, poured into Pilsner glass, about $6

Aroma: Big bready, little sweet Pils like malt

Appearance: hazy golden, big white head with good retention

Taste: light bitter, medium sweet

Palate: crisp, light body, soft carbonation

Overall: A good refreshing beer. Good amount of breadiness and sweet malts. Light and easy to drink. Not a bad beer, does well on a humid day. Breadiness lingers into aftertaste.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","jamesewelch"
237,"2015-08-06",3.3,"This was poured into a stange.
The appearance was a slight hazy burnt yellow color with a one finger white foamy one and a half finger-ed bubbly head that dissipated within less than thirty seconds leaving some clingy messy slightly foamy lacing.
The smell was slightly bready with light sweet lemon clinging to my nose.
The taste was mainly sweet through the previously mentioned flavors. Theres a slight sweet bready aftertaste.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a wonderful sessionability about it. Crisp clean refreshing lemon breadiness sticks to my tongue. Theres a nice smooth carbonation.
Overall, for the most part, its a decent kolsch. It hits the main aspects of the style. Its just nothing over the top. Still, I could see myself coming back to this with its respected food.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
237,"2015-07-31",3.8,"Hazy brown pour. Aroma yeasty bread. Tastes full whole wheat. A little bitter hop bite on end. Great unique rustic ale spin on kolsch.","Seattle, Alabama, USA","nealblind"

Durée moyenne de larrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture légèrement onctueuse. Moyenne effervescence en bouche. Légère présence de citron en arrière goût.

237,"2015-05-12",3.1,"My Bottom Line:
This bubbly Kölsch interpretation shares watered-down banana esters and loose sugars in an otherwise quenching mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the blond haze.
-This is not very Kölsch-like at all, sadly. Mouthfeel is off, malts dont come out nearly as polished as they should and the yeast character is way too prominent.
-Bready yeast appears in the finish.
-A lot of refinement would be needed for this to deesrve the Kölsch appellation.
-This was quite good with parsley soup.
