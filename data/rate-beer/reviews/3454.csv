3454,"2017-03-18",4.6,"Vintage 2014. Un immense merci à Marc-André pour le partage de cette sublime bière. Aucune mousse, filme huileux de surface. Robe noire, opaque mais étonnamment pas lourde du tout. Le liquide valse plutôt légèrement dans mon verre. En y plongeant mon grand nez propulsé par lexcitation, je reçois au visage une chaude attaque de café africain, léger comme tout et comme sil avait été infusé la veille. Le café est encore aussi riche et structuré après tout ce temps? Cest prodigieux! Je respire encore recherchant la base de cette bière que jai dû visiter au moins 50 fois dans ma vie et je ne la trouve nulle-part. Voyons donc! Allez, on ouvre la Stout 2014 pour les comparer côte-à-côte! Cest une autre bière. La structure nest pas la même. Cest autre chose totalement. La café est dune douceur et dune souplesse alors que le stout est liquoreux et riche. Du côté du café, je ne sens aucunement lalcool. La structure du café est à ce point complexe que le reste nest que faire-valoir à sa splendeur. Des notes de bourbon très délicates, un léger caramel blond. Très étrange cette impression que cette déclinaison de la Bourbon County à de plus grandes affinités avec la Barley Wine quavec la Stout. On ouvrira tout de même pas une Barley Wine pour comparer tout de même. Restons raisonnables et contentons-nous dadmirer ce chef doeuvre qui nétait peut-être pas meilleur frais.

App: pitch black, minimal brown head, no retention. Taste and palate: full body, silky, a tad liquoreux, light to medium sweetness, lots of bourbon in mouth, subtle coffee, subtle bitter and alcohol burning finish. Overall: perfect palate. Drinks lovely. Not bitter or just a tiny bit. Love the mouthfeel including this subtle burning finish. Regarding the aroma, first time having this beer so no clue if this is supposed to be more coffee forward. Should have drank it as soon as I got it from this trade, maybe it was already too late.

3454,"2015-10-02",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2016 As Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout, 2014 edition, with 12.6% ABV. Deep mocha beige, crackling head, breaking in instants and leaving a thin beige rim on the edge of the glass with some sparse lacing, but completely vanishing in the end; colour is a very dark mahogany brown, near black, but still transparent (and hazy) on the edges. Strong and complex aroma of coffee liqueur, melting milk chocolate bars, bitter chocolate sauce, dry oak, vanilla tannins, high quality bourbon, brown game stock, soy sauce, marmelade, cappuccino, old madera, gingerbread, pear syrup, black pepper, black tea. Candied sweetness in the mouth, candied dates and marmelade, rounded and a bit sticky but with soy sauce-like umami accents and soft, deep, friendly sourishness for balance, refinedly and gently tingling carbonation, thick and oily but still remarkably supple mouthfeel and therefore remarkably high drinkability; multi-layered, deep caramelly, nutty and chocolatey maltiness, bittersweet and providing a lot of body. Complex finish of big chocolatey and bitterly roasted malts, which blend in smoothly with the added coffee; the latter gives an extra, tangy spiciness to the whole without becoming obtrusive - in fact, the coffee does not seem to simply lay on top of the dark malts as is often the case in coffee stouts, it is actually built in, in a very clever way; warming, peppery alcohol sensations are present but only in the very end and never becoming astringent; and a dry, tannin-rich woodiness along with some deep, structural, spicy hops provide enough drought to balance the initial candied sweetness, the way it ought to be. In fact, this drying ending is very much the same as in the other BCBS beers and I still believe this is what makes them so great. Other big, complex and expensive hyped stouts are often a bit too cloying, only a minor flaw in comparison with their great complexity, but this series does not even show this small imperfection. This coffee edition in particular stands at the same gastronomic height as its regular counterpart; both are obviously very close to each other, but this one has a subtle touch of coffee to add to the already baffling complexity of the regular BCBS, yet it also seems a bit sweeter. The first counterbalances the last.  A thing of utmost beauty, but unfortunately I have to take a second tasting into account, of a younger bottle which showed signs of this much-debated infection; though still highly enjoyable, it did not match the splendour of that first bottle and therefore painfully downgrades my score here.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

3454,"2015-09-27",4.7,"Tijdens bierproeverij, uitgeschonken in Struise BD degusteer glaasje. Dit was een van de bieren waar ik erg naar uitkeek. Zwart bier, met die perfecte olieachtige structuur die een goede Imperial Stout heeft. Het aroma is heerlijk en zoet, met de juiste kenmerken die een Imperial Stout moet hebben. Met tonen van: gebrande mout, karamel, aromatische koffie, zachte bourbon en wat gedroogd fruit als vijgen en dadels. Heerlijk bier met een zoet smaakpallet en en licht droge geroosterde afdronk. Met smaaktonen van karamel, bruine suiker, bourbon whisky, en een verfijnde koffie smaak. De alcohol is verbazend goed verborgen, wat ook iets zegt over de fantastische kwaliteit van deze Amerikaanse Imperial Stout.

Very sparse head; very dark brown beer with a touch of dark red to it.

Very sweet, presumably from the very high alcohol contract. A generalized bitterness, but no distinct, specific hop flavor.

Full bodied; creamy texture; average to slightly light carbonation; finish is long, finish is quite long and sweet with bourbon, coffee flavors and that general bitterness.

Overall this is a very good beer. However I rate it lower than the average RB rating; the alcohol and bourbon are just too dominate. The hops are overwhelmed and the roasted flavors of most stouts (especially coffee stouts) are also in the background. The dried plum flavors are a strength.","Michigan, USA","smroush"

Bourbon and lots of it on the nose. I get the stout behind it a bit and some of the coffee, but really its a bourbon show. After a strong whiff, I actually get a strong fruitiness that I didnt get before.

This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a black color with no head nor any lacing.
The smell started off with a boozey iced coffee. As it warms, a decent chocolate flavoring adds a light spark to the aroma.
The taste was mainly the same - starts off boozey iced coffee and then adding a light chocolate to the flavor. A light iced coffee wet cocoa-esque aftertaste leads to a dry light chocolate finish.
On the palate, this one sat pretty smooth all around. Rolling coffee smooths out the mouthfeel. This one sat about a medium on the body.

Pours a viscous, black color, with a small, soon fading head.

The aromas got a hot Bourbon burn to them, wrapped up into slightly bitter, earthy coffee, with lots of bakers chocolate, molasses and toffee. The coffee acts outstandingly well with the wooden, vanilla accentuated, hot Bourbon, blending flawlessly into the rich, creamy base of the beer. Nontheless, the Bourbon stands out on itself quite well and is even more noteable than the coffee.

Drinks incredible smooth, not particularly creamy, but outstandingly silk, with calming, earthy notes to it, providing an intriguing interplay between milk chocolate and slightly sticky toffee. The Bourbon is big in this, without getting too boozy at any point, while producing a pleasant, oaken warmth with vanilla notes in it, complimenting to the slightly bitter coffee, as well as the scorched, earthy malts and sweet milk chocolate. The coffee becomes visible on the palate, paired with slick caramel and cocoa nibs, while a wooden earthiness adds to the subtle coffee sting, resulting from the harmonious, convenient integrated Bourbon. Finishes with sweeter toffee, as well as molasses and hints of coffee, while smooth, slightly sweeter milk chocolate represents the foundation of this beer.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Not much coffee except for the same musty, earthiness that's in the smell. The mouthfeel is thinner than the regular Bourbon County.

Coffee becomes more apparent as you drink, there is some alcohol burn but not too distracting. The chocolatey flavors stick around through the whole drink. Minor bit of roasted hop towards the end.

The pour is jet black with a half finger cola brown head that dissipates almost immediately. The aroma is coffee ice cream, bourbon, and a tiny bit of barrel. The taste is really complex. It's like the very best coffee ice cream mixed with a bourbon shot. There's lots of other things going on like vanilla, wood, alcohol esters. It's amazing. The finish is slick and viscous.

3454,"2014-11-24",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 1, 2015 This is review of 2013 vintage

Pours a jet black body, 1/4 inch tan head. Lacing was above average and head retention was ok

Smell is of sweet booze, burnt malt, dark chocolate and a little coffee. For 13 percent, alcohol scent isnt too much. 

Taste is big on fudge, vanilla, bourbon soaked oak, and slightly acidic coffee. Smoky, roasted, almost burnt malts offset the sweetness nicely. As beer warms slight bourbon after burn kicks in, kinda nice for cold weather drinking. At a year old, the coffee has faded a bit, 6 months old is probably its prime drinking age. 

Mouthfeel is nice, good amount of carbonation for a beer with a thick consistency. Head died prematurely, which prevented it from being a perfect 5. 

Overall this beer holds its own with the best of them. Rich in smell, taste, and body, very hard to find a coffee stout that rivals it. Unfortunately it is becoming harder to find but I look forward to hunting down a couple bottles every year.","Colorado, USA","Angelmonster"

Cest une bonne chose car on peut y trouver quelque fois des trucs comme cette petite bouteille rouge sur laquelle est inscrite la date suivante : 15 novembre 2013. Donc, ce stout de classe mondiale est ainsi brassé avec des fèves de café Intelligentsia Los Inmortales (enfin jimagine). Même versé dans un verre dhôtel, ce liquide est fier de sa robe noire et de son col haute couture. Cest au nez, par contre, que la magie opère. La fusion des éléments est assez exceptionnelle. Je dirais même parfaite. Je mets le doigt sur du bourbon, de la vanille, un fabuleux café, de la mélasse, du chocolat et du tabac à pipe. Incroyable mais vrai. Sur les papilles, les saveurs saiment et aiment ma bouche. Le café, le bourbon caramélisé, la vanille, le praliné, le chocolat, le bois et les notes rôties agissent comme une fabrique à bonheurs multiples. En bouche, je découvre un corps pleinement mérité. Sa texture riche et soyeuse tapisse ma langue. Je peux compter, heureusement, sur un pétillement nerveux bien capable, il va sans dire, de faire respirer mon palais. En finale, le café fraîchement torréfié applique une couche damertume sur le doux travail des malts et du bourbon vanillé.

Imperial Stout
13.4 % ABV 

APPEARANCE: Poured a midnight deep black. Very little faint toffee colored head that dissipated almost instantly leaving the smallest lace. 

AROMA: Holy Cracker Jack's, I literally just checked the bottle for my prize. The nose on this is epic, toffee, vanilla, fresh ground coffee, oak. Wow. Hints of over ripe deep dark berries. Some chocolate and a faint spiciness. 

TASTE: Right away expresso, roasted, toasted and nutty. Nice sweet malts, chocolate the ripe berries I got in the nose. Toffee, molasses and then the barrel flavor joins the party. Oak, vanilla, hint of cinnamon. Kinda happy I didn't get the spiciness I grabbed in the nose. 

MOUTHFEEL: Very rich, slick and oily. Heavy bodied with very light carbonation. Finished with a nice booziness. 

OVERALL: Amazing beer, intense and delicious. Felt it was super balanced and didn't let the coffee over power the other layers. Personally I put this right under Backyard Rye in the bcs lineup so far. 

RATING: 4.9/5 Zombie Heads!

Pours dark, inky, no head or lacing (but my glass was a touch wet from washing). Stout snifter glass helps the aroma. And what a smell. Coffee and rum and layers of oak. Flavor is phenomenal. The coffee comes through but doesn't overpower what is a rich barrel aged brew. I wouldn't want this every day, but I'd like it more than once! A justly praised and (I think) justly earned reward.

Aromas of huge dark chocolate, roasted coffee, cocoa, roasted malt, caramel, toast, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, clove, light char, and roast/oak earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength.

Lingering notes of dark chocolate, coffee, cocoa, toast, roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, toffee, oak, clove, bourbon, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity of dark/roasted malt, coffee, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/barrel flavor balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish.

And a alot of malt. And not a lot of carbonation or balancing dryness.Suffice to say, I drank a few sips, was asked by the bartender how it was (after he said, ""Youve never had this before?!"") and all I could muster was a halfhearted ""Ya, its great..."". Needless to say, the intensely syrupy-sweet coffee and underattenuated maltiness was less than great.Looking around, and embarrassed to walk away from the bar with a full glass, I poured most of my glass back in to the bottle while no one was looking, took one more sip of my glass and left the rest and walked out quickly. Id write this off to having a bad bottle but come on, was my bottle the underattenuated one in the batch? did my bottle alone not carbonate.

Immediate Bourbon and chocolate in the aroma. As the beer warmed up, more layers of chocolate, coffee,and vanilla.

The taste is highly complex. Layers of chocolate, vanilla, coffee. The finish has a strong Bourbon presence.

The chocolate and Bourbon seem more pronounced in this beer than the Bourbon County stout. The Bourbon whiskey finish is wonderful.

The beer should be served no colder than 50F. As I warmed up the beer from 48F, i noticed a big difference in a few degrees F. At 50F, the coffee kicks in, and the Bourbon becomes stronger. The peak temp should be about 55F. Higher than this, the beer loses some of its intense flavor. Fantastic beer!","Maine, USA","brureview"

3454,"2013-12-21",4.7,"Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a Spiegelau tulip. Bottled on November 15, 2013 printed on label.

Appearance: Pours a motor oil black with a 1 finger toffee brown head which dissipates quickly leaving a ring around the edge of the snifter. Minimal lacing which I would imagine is due to the elevated ABV.

Smell: Loads of fresh roasted coffee alongside notes of bourbon, cocoa and vanilla. The bourbon notes really come out as it warms.

Taste: A perfect mix of cocoa, sweetened coffee and vanilla up front followed by delicious bourbon notes in the middle before ending with just a light amount of dark roasted malt at the finish. Aftertaste is mostly sweet with just a hint of bitterness and a touch of coffee. Extremely well-balanced beer. The alcohol is very well hidden.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a good amount of carbonation. There is a mild alcohol burn as it goes down due to the ABV. Just a touch thinner than Id expect from a big stout like this. 

Drinkability: Excellent drinkability. A very smooth beer that goes down way too easily for 13.4% ABV.

Overall: World class beer overall. The hype behind this one is there for a reason. Its amazing and Im glad I got a chance to try it.

3454,"2013-12-12",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2014 [2012 bottle / fresh] Thanks, Alex! Extremely black center with dark brown trim, topped with a slowly rising, micro-bubble tan head. Aroma is so ""deeply"" roasted; huge notes of dark, roasted, grainy, raw, oily coffee beans... Pure with light bourbon, oak, faint vanilla, cocoa powder, & some brown sugar. Amazingly fresh & vibrant, evolves with time. Taste is creamy, smooth, & silky. Columbian roasted coffee with hints of bourbon, bitter cocoa, dry oak, a touch of vanilla & coconut... I even get a mild spiciness in the finish, seems like chilies almost. Lingering aftertaste of roasted malt, coffee, light oak-y bourbon, & brown sugar. Fantastic stuff.
[2012 bottle / 1 year old] Thanks, Mike! Though the coffee is a bit dialed down, it is still very much present, & this beer is smoother than ever. Integrated flawlessly with literally no burn. Coffee, chocolate, oak, vanilla.... Great stuff as always. Even a year does not ""fade"" it.
[2013 bottle / fresh] As good as the aroma was before, its amazing this year. Like an elegantly blended cup of joe with a perfect amount of bitterness to the roast & enough creamy sweetness to balance. Nice burnt, caramelized sugar undertones with a mild dark fruit aspect in the finish, too. Smoother than the 2012 was fresh. Amazing as always.
[2013 / bottle / 1 year old] This vintage still might be my favorite. Even with a year on it, the coffee aroma is so deep, so roasted, so intense. Beautifully smooth in the palate. Still loaded with coffee. Youd never guess it was a year old. Fantastic.
[2014 / tap / fresh] Out of the gate, this one is less coffee forward in both taste & flavor than previous batches (even aged). Less of that ""intense & deep"" roasted, oily coffee bean presence. Still a great beer, but probably one of the weakest years Ive had, based on the timid coffee presence, even when super fresh.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

3454,"2013-12-11",4.3,"The beer pours an inky, midnight black, much like regular BCBS, a dark tan head briefly forms and then fizzles away to a scrim; the head is slightly lighter than the head that forms on BCBS. In body, the beer is thick, viscous, and opaque, and when swirled, the beer leaves a brief set of alcoholic legs on the glass. On the nose, the beer shows its departure from regular BCBS. Rich fruity coffee buffets the nose with just a trailing hint of spicy solvent and alcohol. The coffee smells of a beautiful medium roast, moving from cocoa beans, to touches of vanilla, dark chocolate, earth, cinnamon, nutmeg, and even a touch of chili powder as the coffee interacts with the spicy alcohol. This beer has a truly delicious nose to it, reminiscent of sticking your head inside a bag of fresh coffee beans. The stout beneath the coffee does get a little confused in the richness of the coffee, blending in places, and muting in others, but Im not all that disappointed by that as I see this beers nose as a vast improvement over the boozy BCBS. The barrel is light in the nose, but seems to be contributing to the vanilla notes, and perhaps also the slight boozy notes. On the tongue, the beer tastes richly complex, blending fruity coffee, rich bourbon barrels, and boozy stout. Sweetness pairs well with the bitters of the coffee, creating a nearly chocolaty sweetness, while rounded tannins lightly touch the finish and provide mild structure in the mouth. Coffee acidity is also present, giving the beer a slight tingle. In flavor, this beer is far superior to BCBS at this age. Rich, fruity coffee beautifully blends with the barrel as the beer touches the tongue bringing fresh medium roast coffee, prunes, earth, and rich dark chocolate flavors. Vanilla and soft oak dance alongside the coffee notes as faint roasted malt character is sensed along the edges of the flavor. As the beer splashes over the back of the throat, hot alcohol does come through, providing spicy notes of cinnamon to coincide with the rich coffee flavors as the coffee is slightly muted. The finish is briefer than BCBS, bringing notes of raw coffee beans, and then freshly brewed coffee, as well as spicy alcohol. In the mouth, the beer is full and slippery, feeling thinner than BCBS but still full with a silky mouthfeel and weak carbonation. The beer remains chewy and luscious, though the coffee has certainly diluted the initial fullness of the beer. Alcohol is smooth and warming, with just a touch of bite. Overall, I like this beer more than I like BCBS. Ill admit that part of that is how the coffee hides the alcoholic bite in this beer, but Im also a coffee-lover and the coffee flavors found in this beer are rich and complex, beautifully blending with the barrel aging. This beer is not KBS, however close it might come, and does still carry some booziness in the finish. I wouldnt age this bottle for more than a couple months, seeing as how the awesome coffee flavors will die out, but I would certainly advise picking up a bottle and trying this puppy out.

Great in all individual parts, just the cloying nature of if brings down the overall score. 12 oz was more than enough!","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
3454,"2013-12-05",4.6,"2013 Bottling. One of the best coffee stours Ive ever had. The nose perfectly balances the bourbon, the stout and the coffee. The coffee is definitely prominent but it doesnt dominate everything completely. Likewise the palate is huge and thick and chewy as you would expect from a bourbon county stout. Flavor is a perfect balance. Not to sweet, not to bitter. The roast character and the bourbon interplay with huge vanilla, tobacco, chocolate and raisin notes. The only areas that keep this from being the perfect beer is that its nothing incredibly mind blowing like BA Hunahpus, BA Abraxas, Morning Wood, or Kentucky Brunch. And the appearance while nice is not as awe inspiring as some other stout offerings. Minor quibbles all, this is an amazing beer.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
3454,"2013-12-05",4.7,"2013 Bottle to snifter. Pitch black body with a thin mahogany Brown head that dances around the edge of the glass a bit. Nose is really strong dark coffee that cloaks a body of bourbon with vanilla, chocolate, and oaky vanilla notes; almost buttery. Taste is a good mix of coffee and bourbon up front that splits into a smooth buttery vanilla body, to a coffee bitter finish that is perfectly warming. Sweet cherry notes throughout. Amazing beer.","Buffalo, New York, USA","Miked1687"

3454,"2013-12-03",3.9,"Surprised I havent reviewed this one yet (this bottle is one of the couple the COOP could provide me. I am very appreciative)

Years ago, Inflatablechair hooked our tasting group with the 22s of this one plenty of times. Tonight a 13 12oz is all mine. A short-lived dark brown head rises only about a quarter inch up and dies very quickly... the brew pours thick and very smooth.

The nose is for the most part hammered with coffee beans... not ""ground coffee"" but cracked coffee beans... there is a nice cocoa element that doesnt really rise up until things warm considerably... the bourbon/barrel presence is not as much as I remember in the 1st batch, but it is still certainly present.

Flavor mirrors the nose with a strong dark fruity element.. a big figgy component that adds needed sweetness... the malts help balance the big coffee bean presence.. very nice chocolate waves sorta envelope the entire palate.

Huge body is no surprise... mild carbonation begs for a sip and contemplation.

Dont age this one... Not worth it.","Boise, Idaho, USA","JohnGalt1"

3454,"2013-04-19",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 3, 2014 UPDATE: 2013 bottle rated 1-3-14. Proper temp into snifter. Pours black. Small fizzy brown head, mostly dissipating. Aroma is loaded with coffee. Rich, dark coffee grounds, espresso, chocolate, sugar, touch of vanilla and wood, bourbon more in the background, not at all boozey. Coffee is front and center and takes over most of the aroma. Full body. Silky, soft and creamy. Flavor starts full of bittersweet coffee (more sweet than bitter) then bursts into bourbon barrel character. Finishes moderate roast sweet with a healthy dose of bourbon. Pleasant alcohol warmth that almost gets too hot but subsides just in time. Killer coffee beer. 

2012 draft(i think) rated 4-19-13. To sum up: Did not enjoy this as much as the original. There seemed to be much more hot alcohol in the flavor, aroma, and palate and it really took over the show for me. Coffee character was almost undetectable until only a small amount remained in the glass (volume - not a temp issue).

3454,"2013-04-05",3.9,"22oz bottle from JMRSN. Reviewed from notes. 

A: Fizzing pour yields an obsidian black body with a geyser turbulating the middle of the surface. Theres an acceptable ring of dark mocha colored head, and legs leave a brown stain on the glass.

N: Loads of vanilla and caramel. Bourbon and wood are pronounced. Chocolate cake with a touch of soy sauce. Theres a touch of espresso. Alcohol soaked raisins.

T: Raisins, vanilla, chocolate, and a coffee acidity. Some roast, but this is mostly sweet with a little spice like that of rye whiskey. Some salt.

M: Coating and yet some wateriness at the end. Lots of alcohol.

O: I expected more coffee out of this vintage. This also has a quality I dont recall from the 2010 vintage, and as such, its good, but its not the best of the lineup. Still worthy.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

3454,"2013-03-02",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 20, 2014 2014 Release Update - Fresh as last time.  This is much heavier on coffee.  This needs some age.  Age this at least a year, or youre not doing it justice.

2013 Release - Aged 1 month in bottle.  Thanks to ryanfolte for the trade!   Pours dark brown with short lived brown head.  There is a great coffee bean aroma in the forefront while the head is around, but after that it blends perfectly into the mix with oak, vanilla, bourbon, and chocolate.  Taste is much of the same, with vanilla, bourbon, roasted malts, and wood.  Not being a coffee fan, the amount of coffee in this is ideal.  The reason this is better than BCBS is the hint of coffee balances the sweetness inherent in the beer.  Palate is amazing - very thick and rich.  Aftertaste is the best, with the rich sweetness of the bourbon mixing with the coffee.  Way too drinkable for 13%. 

2012 Release - Aged 4 months in bottle.  Pours jet black with small brown head and decent lacing.  Aroma is cocoa, oak, licorice, vanilla, bourbon, malty, sour - its intoxicating.  Taste follows suit and is sweet roasted malts and vanilla with molasses, alcohol heat,  and a lot less coffee than I expected - its barely detectable.  Palate is creamy and thick, pushing the limits of being just a little too sticky sweet.  Overall this is the total package of depth, flavor, and alcohol.

Big rich earthy coffee, fades into roasty cocoa notes, then sweetens up with vanilla and chocolate with a touch of bourbon booze that lingers on the palate.

3454,"2013-01-17",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2014 Bottled November 15, 2013 (2 months old).
Appearance: The body is pitch black with a dense and short brown head that sinks into the body quickly, but leaves a dense coating. Very nice looking stout.
Aroma: The aroma is strong of earthy and mildly astringent coffee, hints of bourbon, smoke and coconut back this with a vanilla cake presence. The aroma is quite nice, good strength though not as expressive as I remember it last year.
Taste: The intro is a mild of bourbon, quickly the flavor becomes strong of coffee and syrupy chocolate. Coffee dances on the palate throughout while stepping aside for a bourbon heavy finish. The finish lingers of roast and dark chocolate.
Palate: Thick and chewy, I love the thick viscosity of this.
Overall: From memory the 2012 release wins for me. I found it bolder and more complex and less boozy. This is a great beer still.
Previous Ratings: Ar: 8, Ap: 4, Ta: 9, Pa: 5, Ov: 18 = 4.4 
Bottled November 12, 2012 (2 months old).
Appearance: The body is pitch black and only a thin brown coating escapes the body before being sucked back down with only a very thin ring remaining.
Aroma: Earthy roasted coffee comes to mind first with a dark chocolate backing, very light barrel notes, only a light vanilla and subtle oak. The aroma is fantastic, it reminds me a tad of Kahlua.
Taste: Oh boy this is wonderful, very complex with an earthy roasted coffee intro with slight wood flavors, the mid-taste adds sweet chocolate syrup with some vanilla that leads to a slight bourbon on the finish with sweet syrupy chocolate. This is phenomenal, everything is blended so well together.
Palate: Thick and syrupy, touch of carbonation.
Overall: Best thing Ive drank all year, one of the best beers Ive ever had. This is much better than Bourbon County Stout to me and well worth $20 a bottle. Oh boy this is good, my only regret is that I dont have fudge to eat with this.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Creamy and thick, alcohol really hits the nose.  Lingering alcohol warming and a little coffee aftertaste.  Great stuff.","Maryland, USA","radio_nowhere"
3454,"2013-01-12",4.0,"2010, 2011 and 2012 bottles. Numerical rating reflects the 2012. 
Aroma: The 2010 has lots of green bell pepper and vegetable notes in aroma. No coffee at all. 2011 has hints of green pepper, but also some coffee aroma. The 2011 also has some nice chocolate aroma. 2012 has nice coffee with balanced chocolate and roast; no noticeable green pepper. This beer is much better fresh. Light alcohol spice an a touch of anise. This is really nice. 
They all pour dark brown, almost black with light brown notes on the edges. Pours with a mocha head that quickly recedes to the edges. Medium legs and no lacing. 
Flavor: 2010 still has a bit of a vegetable note but I can still pick up a bit of coffee, but very light. Roast is fairly noticeable and there is light chocolate notes. Alcohol is present with a bit of spiciness. Medium low astringency. 2011 has a lot more coffee flavor and almost no green pepper. A really nice chocolate flavor to the 2011 with some secondary roast notes. 2011 also has some nice sweetness to it that 2010 was lacking. 2012 has some great milk chocolate sweetness. A nice coffee flavor with a bit of roast. Some alcohol spice to the flavor in the finish; this is the only thing that the older vintages have done better - the age mellowed the alcohol heat. 
Medium full bodied with medium carbonation. Medium alcohol warmth. Low to medium low astringency. Medium high alcohol heat b
Overall a really good beer but it doesn't get better with age. The vegetable quality that develops really isn't good. Probably not as good as the hype.

3454,"2012-12-27",4.7,"Reviewed 12/25/2012. Bottle says 14.3%. 22 oz bottle poured into an adorable little goblet.

A: Pours a pitch black color. Much like regular BCBS, the dark tan head fades away to nothing in little time. Nice alcohol legs.

S: Smells quite similar to BCBS, with bourbon, chocolate, dark fruits, cream, and brown sugar...right up until rich, exquisite black coffee makes itself known. This is such a joy to inhale, even over regular BCBS. Wow.

T: Its BCBS with coffee. No, that doesnt sound terribly descriptive, but the coffee used is completely fabulous, and plays perfectly with the big sweetness and decadence of the base beer. Tiny little subleties of cream, vanilla, hazelnut, dark fruits, bourbon, and rare (just kidding about that one) give it real enjoyability factor. A little booze pops up in the finish, but not nearly enough to suggest its 14.3%. This one will completely wreck me in the morning...

M: This doesnt seem to feature the syrupy heft of the base beer. Rather, its drier and thinner, featuring carbonation that seems to be a bit more vibrant. Still an amazingly sticky and viscous coffee stout. The flavor intensity and finishing booze still suggests one to sip. Actually, I kind of prefer the feel of this over standard BCBS.

O: I didnt think this would be much better than BCBS - but I was wrong. Even though its quite boozy, its one of those offerings where the intense flavors render that problem moot. Id even say it lives up to the hype. Good luck killing a bomber solo if youve already had a few drinks tonight, though...my body is saying no but my tastebuds are saying fuck yes!","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Pours an opaque deep chocolatey-blackish color (like blackstrap molasses) with a thin mocha head that disappeared almost as soon as it appeared. Nose is only slightly boozy by comparison to the standard BCS this year, with some raisins and maple notes in here as well. Mouth is thick and oily, Mouth is chocolatey and and some bourbon up front, a hint of the coffee (Chris at Binnys warned me it would fade quickly) and every time I belch, it tastes like I just ate a bowl of Cocoa Pebbles (not necessarily a bad thing). Absolutely No sootiness, which is a HUGE plus when it comes to the infinite number of stouts that are out there these days.

3454,"2012-10-14",4.4,"22 oz. bottle served in a Deschutes tulip. 2011 vintage, bottled on 1-11-2012.

A: Pours a jet black with a viscous body and a one finger dark khaki head the dissolves rather quickly to a thin collar. Pretty still body.

S: Crushed coffee beans and raw cocoa fill the nose first and foremost. Digging in a little deeper yields some light bourbon, subtle oak and some vanilla-esque sweetness.

T: The coffee is very upfront (as well it should be) with a mashed, straight from the bag rawness to it. The bourbon barrel starts to peak through around mid-palate and it leads into a blend of milk chocolate and roasted malts. The finish is a sweet mix of caramel and vanilla. The ABV is basically non-existent.

M: Heavy bodied, but velvety and smooth the whole way through. The carbonation is medium to low and it sticks across your whole palate with a mocha like sweetness. The slightest bit of warming comes through at the backend, but this ABV is just so well hidden.

O: Delicious. While I thought the nose wasnt up to what I wanted it at the taste more than made up for what the nose lacked. Wave after wave of flavor is so well layered in this beer, and the steps the taste takes you on are great. Nothing dominated in the flavors, just a very well balanced beer. The ABV is hidden so well its insane. Chalk up another winner for the GI barrel program.

3454,"2012-09-04",4.1,"So stoked to find a 2010 bottle of this at Bierkraft. Pours black, with dark brown edges, and a small tan head. Aroma is, as expected, rich coffee-infused bourbon. A bit of dark fruit makes it sweeter, and the coffee counters that well. Tons of vanilla -- like someone dumped a significant quantity of vanilla extract in. Boozy, even after a couple of years -- seems like it would take forever to kill off the burn in this brew. Bourbon and oak hit you up front, with brown sugar and vanilla (maybe some good rum), and the coffee moves in toward the finish. Totally delicious, but this will definitely knock you back. The coffee is a great addition.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"
3454,"2012-08-28",2.9,"A-- Poured dark cola and settled black. A few gurgles of head here and there but otherwise just some ordinary bubbles that made up a thin collar. 

S-- Oak, vanilla, bourbon and soft coffee. Not as big as CBS had. Very sweet nose. Alcohol very present.

T-- Devoured by sweetness and barrel. Waves of sugar just eat this up. More like diabetes on a barrel. 

M-- Full, rich and low carbonation. Where is my insulin shot?? Just way above the top in sugar. Coffee is secondary as the sugar just attacks this beer and makes it overly sweet. Alcohol is quite obvious. 

O-- Tough to drink and enjoy unless have had several beers already. Just a task to drink and overly massive for the sake of being massive. Will avoid the base beer when possible as too sweet for me.","AUSTRALIA","fletchfighters"

3454,"2012-08-05",4.6,"Ive always thought Goose Islands world famous ""Bourbon County Brand Stout"" was a little overrated and I can name many imperial stouts I consider superior. Well, apparently all this beer was missing was a bunch of coffee added to the recipe because it went from a by-the-book imperial stout to a pretty amazing imperial coffee stout.

 I received a 22oz bottle in a trade with a friend (thanks, Joe!). I split it with a friend. We each poured it into tulip glasses.

Appearance: Extremely dark black body, completely opaque (is an understatement). Forms a small, dark brown, fizzy head which evaporates almost as quickly as a soda and leaves no lacing on the glass.

Smell: Strong coffee aroma for sure, like a pot of coffee sitting on the burner. Certain alcohol sweetness as well like a rum or Kahlua.

Taste: Theres two ways to look at this beer: is it an imperial coffee stout or is it an imperial stout plus coffee? It may seem to be splitting hairs but there definitely is a difference. While this beer, GIBCBCS, is indeed robust in pretty much every way, I can honestly say Ive had other beers with more pronounced coffee flavor - imperial or otherwise. This is more accurately described as Kahlua - the beer. Theres a strong sweetness throughout the entire palate, a simultaneous combination of vanilla extract and bakers chocolate. Rich sweetness plus noticeable bitterness from coffee and chocolate.

Theres not much to describe in terms of the usual beer attributes of hops and malts. Well there definitely is a prominent roasted malt flavor, especially through the middle. Then as it finishes theres a strong burst of gentle warmth, slight dryness and additional sweetness. Whats remarkable is how clean the beer finishes with very little aftertaste. The alcohol definitely works with the palate but upstages the genuine imperial stout quality a tad. Not that I mind because in the end youre left with an absolutely delicious, complex and very satisfying beer. I can only see this improving with age.

Drinkability: I drank GIBCBCS on a hot summers night and I have to admit that it was actually a little refreshing for the first moment or two. Much like how an iced coffee would be even though theres bitterness and sticky sweetness to it. The body is much thinner than I was expecting and quite tepid as well . It goes down extremely smooth and has no cloying aftertaste (I wouldve been okay with a coffee, chocolate or vanilla aftertaste, though). 

The 14% does make itself known as there is significant heat on every swig, but it didnt overwhelm me or fill me up at all. Id drink this beer all the time if it were reasonably priced and readily available. As a special occasion beer it definitely does the job, though.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

3454,"2012-07-25",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 2, 2013 2013 Bottle consumed on Black Friday (day of release) at Goose Island Brewpub in Chicago. Sizable pour at room temp.

A -  Pours dark brown into the glass. light brown on the edges. Pretty black in the glass but not pitch black. No head at all. 

S - Big coffee at the start, boozy musky hot bourbon scent followed by raisins and vanilla. Love the vanilla finish in this. Ill note that the 2013 fresh has the most remarkable coffee smell in almost any beer Ive had. The only beer with a better coffee smell was Kentucky Brunch from TG and honestly, on the mass scale, this is remarkably huge in coffee. 

T -  Wow. Okay. yeah, the coffee is big in 2013. previous batches had a more muted coffee taste but this explodes with fruity sweetness and ripened tree fruit. Pears? The classic BCBS taste is here with oak, bourbon and figs. Dried dates and some banana on the end.  The only annoying thing about this beer is the overpowering tobacco at the finish.

M - 20% carbonation. Heavy body. Insanely boozy delicious finish.

O - Ive had Coffee BCS 11 and 12 but both I had after a year they were bottled. 2013 fresh is simply mind blowing. Enjoy this one ASAP if you have it. Previous rating was 3.8...Im bumping that WAY up.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

3454,"2012-05-01",3.5,"In short: A cloying vanilla coated malt orgy with a cup of black coffee.  Acceptable sipper
How: Bottle 22oz.  Tasted that one when fresher, this rating for a bottle approximately 16 months of age, split 4-way. 
The look: Black body topped by a small tan ring of foam
In long: Nose has obviously lots of coffee but instead of the nice roasted coffee beans I was expecting, the smell was more like smelling a freshly used wet coffee filter.  Also some alcohol fumes and overall roasted malts sweetness.  This beer smells big and dirty.  In mouth the coffee takes the backseat with the thick heavy maltiness stealing the spotlight.  Heavy caramel, lots of vanilla, uber-rich chocolate cake, dirty wood.  There is obviously coffee flavors but again it is more like a cup of black coffee than roasted coffee beans.  Not enough roastiness to dry out the beer and overall it felt very sticky.  All that being said this is not a bad beer at all but the drinkability is very low, Id probably grow tired of it before I finish a bomber.  I remember liking it more the first time, oh well  Im not surprised to see the incredibly high ratings on this beer.  there are only two absolute certainties about the future of America: big black boozy sweet American beers will continue getting good ratings on ratebeer, and Will Smith will have the lead role in the eventual Barack Obama biopic.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Palate is incredible, big malts of vanilla and coffee up front, so smooth through the mid and a punch of bourbon in the finish.  Its insane.  With that said I have just taken down a 22 of the 11/12 and found it to be lackluster and boring compared to when I had the previous bottling.

3454,"2012-03-10",3.2,"My Bottom Line:
This sugar rush of an Imperial Stout exhibits caramel, chocolate, coffee and vanilla in an obese body enlightened by alcohol burn.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the blackness with brown edges.
-Some fruitiness is found here and there.
-There are way more residual sugars than actual malt flavors.
-The aroma is of simple coffee ; not necessarily freshly brewed.
-This is a decadent dessert, so I understand the ratings its getting. However, I cant see it being more enjoyable than Baileys Irish Cream to me. Those who love Southern Tier flavored Imperial Stouts will love this too.

O: I had previously had this brew from a bottle and still have a few in the cellar, but the draft is even better.

3454,"2012-02-23",4.9,"From notes.  First reviewed 5/2/2010.  2011 bottle update 2/6/2012.  Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a snifter.  2011 update:  The 2011 version of this beer maintains everything that I loved about the first time I had it, and somehow is even better.  I opened a 2011 bottle at cellar temperature and another was opened at fridge temperature at Kellys Pub.  

Like every other bourbon county (and variant) I have opened, this viscous black imperial stout oozes out of the bottle like some kind of black tar. Pitch black with just the slightest mahogany brown edges. The bottle I opened up at cellar temperature manufactured a robust mocha brown head on the initial pour into my snifter. With the ABV, the cap was not destined to last long, but it still provided a nice thin film over the beer and a frothy ring around the edge of the glass. When opened at colder temperatures, it is much more difficult to get much of any head to form, even with an aggressive pour.

The biggest difference in my mind between the two vintages is the aroma. The Anjilanaka coffee beans used in this years batch simply explode out of the bottle when opened and waft up from the glass throughout the glass. As a coffee drinker, this is simply heaven. This coffee smells thoroughly roasted, with notes of hazelnut and burnt caramel in addition to a distant fruit note. Dark roasted malt, bitter chocolate, molasses, vanilla, oak, and bourbon all fade to the back behind a dominant coffee presence. There is no alcohol anywhere in the nose.

The flavor is still very coffee-forward, but much more balanced than the aroma. Fresh Bolivian coffee roasted to perfection comes through first, with a strong showing from the dark, bitter chocolate, and roasted malt. Each of these blend and interact so well with the others flavors, creating an ever-changing wall of roasted and bitter flavors. Vanilla, molasses, and bourbon step in next, adding some sweetness and further depth to the flavor. The bourbon presence grows as the sip progresses and my tongue accustoms itself to the bitter coffee and roasted malt flavors. By the end, I get a bit more vanilla and some light oak as well. It has varying degrees of bitterness all the way through, with a clear emphasis on the coffee.
The mouthfeel is exactly what I want in an imperial stout, and even though I have tried quite a few since I first had the Bourbon County Coffee, I have yet to find its equal. Each sip coats my entire mouth and tongue with a chewy, grainy, and smooth liquid. The flavors seem to permeate into every part of my mouth, and it is more of an experience that just drinking the beer. The carbonation is perfectly tuned to the ultra thick and viscous nature of the beer, giving it a milky creaminess and never getting in the way.

This is as close to a perfect beer as I can think of; it is just absolutely incredible.

Original review: 9/4/10/5/19
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a snifter. Bottled 3/26/10. #2133.

This almost oozes out of the bottle, it is that thick. The color is completely pitch black, with thin brown head, which quickly erodes to a ring. It communicates the message - ""Be ready, this is intense.""

A charismatic aroma; a smooth blend of robust roasted malt, roast coffee, with a nice bourbon presence, some bitter chocolate, and a few lingering alcohol phenols. 

Wow. If Bourbon County Stout is a smokey dragon, this is the well-refined dragon you can take out to a fancy dinner. It is wonderfully put together, with a smooth flavor all the way through. Roasted malt with hints of chocolate and vanilla start the sip, with roast coffee and bourbon balancing each other out. There is a slightly bitter aftertaste, and the alcohol warms the stomach. There is no real alcohol bite, though, which is quite surprising. The espresso flavor prevents this from being as overtly smokey and boozy like the regular BCS. Substantially better in my opinion.
Could this be any smoother? Creamy, with perky carbonation contained in a very full body.
 
I could sip this all day and all night. There is enough complexity to keep the whole glass interesting, but the smooth construction makes each sip wonderfully simple. I just had a revelation.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

A - Pitch black viscous body with a dark mocha head. Fades quickly to some very light edging. Alcoholic legs with minimal lacing. Looks identical to standard BCBS.

S - Very different from the other coffee stouts Ive tried. It starts off initially with a huge coffee presence, but its very savory and spicy rather than sweet. There is notes of black pepper, leather, licorice, and soy. The finish is burnt oak and light vanilla.

T - Much sweeter than the nose. This is one of the best coffee beers I have ever tried. I dont even think Ive even had coffee that has tasted this good. Very very dark roasted espresso beans laced with vanilla, coconut, cocoa powder and charred oak. The finish is smooth with bourbon and lightly bitter beans. Phenomenal, one of the best tasting stouts I have tasted. Mouth feel is silky smooth and the viscous body coats the mouth evenly. 14% abv is not noticeable at all. 

O - This doesnt beat out the base beer for me. I absolutely love the complexity that is BCBS, and I think adding coffee takes away from that experience a bit. Its integrated really well, but its just too much happening at once. However, this is the best coffee beer I have ever tasted. The flavors are just so intense and world class.

Not as guilty a pleasure as the vanilla version.  Had this again @ 2015. The Aroma of this one was very coffee forward in an almost spicy way along with the BC base.

Not sure what it was like at the release, but this was already showing green, vegetal, oxidized coffee character that ruined the otherwise stellar BCS base beers. Im not sure how they do their coffee infusion but it added an unpleasant aspect to the beer that was hard to get over. As you would expect from BCS though, its one thick, silky beer with a lot of bourbon and heat.

Appearance: Almost black with thin brown head and light lacing.

Aroma: Booze, bourbon, coffee, chocolate, licorice and molasses.

Taste: Tastes like chocolate covered espresso beans that have been soaked in bourbon. The chocolate and coffee are augmented by molasses, anise, roasted barley and a big blast of alcohol. Tastes like a less boozy and bourbony version of the standard Bourbon County, with just a dash more coffee.

A - Pours midnight black with a nice one and a half finger tall brown head leaving light rings of lace down the glass.

S - Smells of rich bourbon, fresh brewed coffee grounds, dark roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, and some dry oak tannins. This one is all about the bourbon and coffee.

T - Starts off with a big dose of warm bourbon quickly giving way to a mix of rich coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and some dryness from the oak tannins. I heard the coffee was dropping off in this one, not in this bottle as it still has plenty to go around. The alcohol is ever present but never really gets to the point of being overpowering. The finish is a mix of dark roast and light bourbon heat, lingering for some time.

this Impy had a black pour with a small tan and coffee colored head, this ale is dark/opaque but I see small strings of flowing bubbles at the sides of the glass when held up to a light, this beer left a few spots of lacing on the glass, there was a very thin film of sediment on the bottom of the bottle, 

there were aromas of bourbon with various liquor notes and chocolate, roasted malt and roasted coffee, there was faint vanilla in the background, 
the aroma was very nice, rich, the coffee was an accent to this drink and was not too overbearing like I find some Coffee Imperial stouts,  
no alcohol aroma except the bourbon, 



the flavors were bourbon liquor, syrup and dark sugar sweetness, roasted malt, chocolate, with some coffee in the background, 
there was a little bite from the alcohol/bourbon liquor, rich on the palate and it got sickly sweet on the palate, the bourbon becomes a bit much as the glass warmed up, and the coffee flavor was hardly noticeable, 

the mouth feel was full and had gave a creamy feel.  

This Impy had a  really nice aroma but the flavor was a bit on the sweet side, I found the coffee was more noticeable on the nose than the palate,  this ale would be nice for a evening sip or a night cap on a cold night but it was sweet, less sweet would help and I would have given this a higher score, I think this beer needs more bitterness to help counter the sweetness, as the glass warmed up to room temperature, I had a hard time drinking it with all of the sweetness, I was a little disappointed with this beer.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

Not much lacing on the glass but for such a big beer thats not too surprising. Carbonation will remain a mystery. Disturbing the beer by swirl leaves some legs on the glass.

Aroma is so strong and complex. I pick up liquor and alcohol at first, kind of obvious and some chocolate and dark fruits as well. Coffee is in there but it wasnt the most dominant or noticeable flavor. I was expecting more coffee.

Hmmm....beer is sweet and some of the bourbon edge from the regular version is missing here. Perhaps the addition of coffee some how mellowed the liquor character of the beer. Unfortunately, thats why I drink bourbon county, for the hot liquor flavor. There is some bitterness to this version, greater than the other, not as dry, coffee flavors in the back. Ive had several vintages of the other BCS and on draft and I enjoyed the non-coffee more. A great experience to try this though for sure. Hopefully the wife will love it.

The coffee is still there in the smell and it blends wonderfully with the Bourbon County Stout. This one is also significantly oakier than the regular it seems. The nose is a cornucopia of dark malt scents including, chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, and a hint of fruitiness. The coffee is in there with a nice fresh coffee smell that isnt the same as the roasty malt scents. On top of it all is the aforementioned oak, very nice woodiness and vanilla smooth out the smell. And of course you cant forget the bourbon and the alcohol, both add a sweet alcoholic bite just to prick your nostrils.

The taste is pretty damn good, Im not a fan of BCS, and Ive only had it fresh so having it mellowed out and with coffee added, it is a whole other beast. It is still on the cloying side with a big alcoholic punch, but it is infinitely smoother with the coffee addition and extra aging. The bourbon is still key here but when it melds with the coffee it smooths out and becomes delightful. Of course the chocolate, roasty malts, caramel, and dark fruit all make an appearance here as well as the oak.

The mouthfeel is rich and thick liek BCS with a subtle carbonation. The alcohol is once again a bit burning but dramatically reduced form BCS. The drinkability issue and cloying mouthfeel were somewhat fixed but not completely, nevertheless, the hardly get in the way of the decadent flavor.

I did not want to believe the hype, but this is so much better than BCS and one of my favorites now.

smells amazing, coffee, bourbon, roast, malt, caramel, oaky notes with touches of vanilla.

Tastes so smooth and rich. malt and coffee with chocolate riding it out, nice run of bourbon right smack in the middle giving to caramel and vanilla oakiness. suprisingly smooth, definately not ""hot"". There is a nice alcohol taste taht comes out in this but nothing like regular BCS, old Rasputin, or KBS. its subtle and rounded. the balance of flavors in this is perfect. 

Sticky on the lips, round full and smooth with a nice oiliness on the tongue. The aging must have mellowed this out to perfect drinkability. I dont think i want to age any of my bottles, going to drink them all within the year.

This was way more drinkable than I expected it to be. very intense brew though. Balanced complexities wins in this. nothing sticks out over anything else.

bring out the Kentucky Pecan pie for this one just like KBS. I can think of nothing better to pair this up with.","Bloomington, Minnesota, USA","SourNotes"
3454,"2011-02-26",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 22, 2015 Pours black with very little head. Aromas are full on bourbon cask, vanilla, corn sirup and a hint of coffee. The mouthfeel is great - medium thick.

Pours a jet black with a tan head. Head sticks around for a bit, leaves a good amount of lacing on the goblet.
Smells great. Huge coffee, chocolate, raisins, malt, caramel, wood, and bourbon. Very complex and really entices the imbiber to go ahead and take a drink.
Big malt up front. Finishes with some vanilla and coffee. Nice chocolate and caramel undertones. Everything seems to blend together like it is supposed to. Slight woodiness and a bit of a sweet bourbon taste, but not so much that you would pick it out at first. A little hot from the ABV, but very well hidden mostly.
Coats the inside of the mouth like used motor oil, in a good way. The sweetness seems to dominate in this department, but it isnt so cloying that you dont want to drink more; ala DL.
If I were brave and had a full day to recover, I could drink this all night. Might take a few wallets full of cash to pull off too.

A: Pours much like the regular Bourbon County Stout--rich black and quite oily with a nice, thick mocha head. 

S: Intense chocolate mocha espresso with quite a bit of bourbon coming through as well. Pretty strong vanilla presence along with roasted malt, oak, and molasses.

T: The bourbon comes out a bit more, mixing with loads of dark chocolate and espresso. Some roasted malt and residual sweetness, but mostly the interplay between the bourbon, chocolate, and coffee.

M: Heavy and viscous. The initial sip is quite a bit of alcohol heat, but the other flavors begin to take over as it warms toward room temperature.

D: This is one heavy, intense brew. A bomber between 5 people was more than enough. Very tasty, although I imagine itd be hard to finish even a 12oz. bottle alone.

The first think that was really pronounced to me was the great coffee aromas. It was better than any Starbucks coffee I had. We all know coffee is a dominate aroma to overcome especially this one but I did get a slight vanilla note there as well.

Le tout se marie a merveille, le grillé et torréfie ainsi que les notes de chocolat et moka font que cette bière continue a se développer et atteint son paroxysme à température ambiante.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

The aroma couldnt be more striking, its like the aroma you get when you walk into a coffee shop and theyre roasting, the coffee is that fresh and vibrant. There is some dark chocolate and a mild sweet maltiness shows through as well, but this is really all about the coffee. The flavor is roasty and has a fair bit of dark chocolate, some maple syrup, some bourbon, and tons of coffee fruity earthy coffee, the booze is there but its fairly well concealed.

3454,"2010-09-20",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2013 No aging (2010 vintage/draft/""Intelligentsia Bosque Lya""): I sampled this at the Great American Beer Festival soon after its release on September 16, 2010. This beer made my head shake that night. It was pretty amazing. I almost didnt know how to describe it. The aroma alone knocked my head off. 

Aged 2+ years (2010 vintage/bottled/""Intelligentsia Black Cat""): Deep, dark brown, but not quite black in color with a bright, almost orange colored head, this is a fine stout. It has an almost smoky, meaty malty aroma with no noticeable notes if coffee... But wood and bourbon are present and well-infused. Very smooth. Not too woody or bourbony, its very much like the original Bourbon County Stout, but a little sharper. Smooth and silky in the mouth, bourbon and dark chocolate take the front, with coffee unnoticeable. Its so soft in the mouth... So nice. Too bad about Goose Islands new allegiance, though.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

Black hole pour with a creamy dark latte head that left lacing.  Aroma is very assertive with deep rich espresso, vanilla, bourbon, Nestle Quik, and caramel.  Flavor has the sweet BCS bourbon qualities with an amazing bitter Starbucks coffee punch.  Truly reminiscent of a chocolate covered coffee bean soaked in bourbon.  Doesnt that sound awesome?

As the beer warms I do smell some vanilla and chocolate/expresso but certainly not the noticeable coffee aroma I anticipated.

Perhaps I should have sat on this bottle longer but I cannot see the expresso/coffee asserting itself more with age.

3454,"2010-09-14",4.7,"1400th rating.  Draft at the Goose Island Invasion at International Tap House in Chesterfield.  I started with this one in a BCS flight alongside the regular one and the Vanilla one.  The aroma made it easy to identify next to the two identical sister beers, with rich, smooth coffee roast coming forward first, and then bourbon, chocolate malts, vanilla, oak, and cream.  The flavor takes it to another level: quite simply the best coffee beer Ive ever had (and Im not a coffee drinker), with absolutely perfect balance between the smooth, roasty coffee, the rich, creamy chocolate malts, and the barrel notes of bourbon, oak, and vanilla.  Full-bodied, with enough carbonation and booze to keep it from being completely oily and smooth.  The booze is a nice complement, though, and doesnt really warm significantly until its all the way down.  I couldnt get enough of this (ordered a full glass after the BCS flight), and Im interested to see what a bottle of this is like compared to the drafts I had.  Amazing.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3454,"2010-09-11",4.1,"After a short lived fizz of dark brown head this rests black as pitch.  Its a big, viscous monster, a boogie-man of a beer.  On the nose bourbon, vanilla and oak are immediately pronounced .  Theres no mistaking the whiskey.  But almost as strong is the chocolate, which rises like an expensive malt truffle.  This seems to have more of a fruit presence than the normal Bourbon County; I can find steeped cherries, plums, burnt raisins and baked apples.  There is also a strong marzipan aroma and perhaps even a touch of cinnamon.  Surprisingly, however, the coffee really isnt developed or distinct.  It is detectable, but its held so close to those bourbon and chocolate aromas that its easily diminished.  That said , one can pick it up in the mouth, where its balanced carefully against the bourbon and chocolate.  There is ash and molasses, tobacco and leather, and definitely something of walnut or hazelnut.  It seems that the liqueur sweetness serves to add some backbone to the more subtle flavours, which otherwise may be tyrannized into nothingness by the staggeringly strong whiskey.  The mouth feel is very thick with a medium to low carbonation - very smooth.  The bold ABV is present but less so than the normal Bourbon County, which also seemed thicker in its body.  Given two years in the cellar and this will be something special.  As it is, I prefer the non-coffee original, but this is nonetheless an impressive stout and a defining desert beer.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","theSlipperyPen"

Basically this is a very good beer, great appearence, very strong aroma and flavourful, but if the bourbon were less prominent and the alcohol less noticeable this would clearly be an outstanding beer. The sweetness is maybe excessive for my liking, but its justified.","Firenze, ITALY","Slayer85"

Thanks to members of the Akron crew for bringing this up to finish up the tasting. Despite the heat it was a great compliment to a bottle of 2010 Dark Lord. In fact side by side I might have slightly preferred this. The bourbony aspects that dominate BCS are here but somehow the coffee balances it out well. Overall this is sure to be a hit with anybody that like their beers big and bold.

Aroma / Appearance - Deep and oily the black body was as sticky as youd expect a 13% ABV base beer to be. Slimy sheets of tan lacing only added to the haze. Black coffee, used motor oil, and a shot of bourbon give this heat that is warmer than even direct sunlight on a summers day. Ash and smoke complete the chewy combination which you could dwell over for a very long time.

Flavor / Palate - Dense and oily the first sip immediately coats the mouth like drinking water from the Gulf of Mexico. Heavy and warm with a bitter kick the thickness is impossible to miss. I suspect you could stick a spoon in this and it would stand on its own. Sweet blackberries, anise, dark chocolate, and smoke beg for attention before the coffee finish slams them to the ground. This complicated imperial stout takes a well crafted world class beer up another notch. Maybe some day Ohio will repeal its 12% cap so this can make it across the border.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Pours oily thick jet black with some dark mocha bubbly head.  Big legs down the side of the glass.

Aroma was, as expected, dominated by coffee giving off hints of deep dark chocolate and cherry, with some big vanilla notes as well.  As it warmed, the molasses became more prevalent and offered a great balance to the roastiness.\

While I love BCS with a couple years of age, the BCBCS was absolutely perfect fresh out of the bottle.  The nutty roasted notes really cut into the sometimes overpowering bourbon of regular BCS, but this brew is perfectly balanced.  As it warmed, the vanilla really came forward as the coffee took a back seat for the finish.

While this didnt drink like 13%, it is no doubt a sipper.  The big buttery mouthfeel was fantastic, and I only got slight burn from the alcohol.

3454,"2010-06-14",4.0,"Bomber.  Pours virtually pitch black, looking quite thick and menacing.  A small, smooth head of dark brown foam slowly gives way, settling to a thin film, leaving dense, glass staining sheets in its wake.  The nose paints a portrait of intensity, booming from the glass with monstrously sweet dark chocolate and caramel malt notes, loaded with intense, roasty coffee, and smooth, vanilla laden bourbon.  There is no mistaking the barrel influence here, as the bourbon seems just as prominent as it does in the boozy base beer.  Flavors too are big, sweet, and bourbon driven.  Dark, syrupy chocolate and scorched caramel malts are countered only by the bitter earthiness of the coffee roast.  Wood and vanilla are again intense and boozy.  The palate is downright thick, clearly heavy on sugars and big, sticky malts.  Bourbony heat warms the gullet, lingering on the tongue for a good while.

T: The bourbon and barrel flavors come through more than I would have expected. Certainly plenty of vanilla and the coffee flavor is quite intense. A nice chocolatey and sweet finish.

M: As one might expect, this is a full bodied beer. The carbonation is low and smooth, giving the beer a very creamy mouthfeel.

The pour was expected. Gorgeous dark stout with tight mocha  carbonation that disspated quickly. Best part about this beer for sure, however everything on was total crap. Aroma is straight bourbon. Nothing complex what so ever. At least bring some complexity into this. I thought this beer was brewed with top notch Intelligentsia Black Cat Espresso. Taste is of more bourbon with slight cremed sugar and lactose. Can I get some toasty malt or some hops in this, please? Taking another whiff of this, I get cheap vanilla extract with more milk chocolate (hence the lactoce again). The body is rich and full without any stickyness. Finish is one dimensional with bourbon straight through. I hardly want another sip. Luckily Im splitting this beer with a friend or else Id drain pour at least half the bottle.

3454,"2010-05-15",5.0,"Ladies and gentleman, we have ourselves a winner.  I did not think I would come across a beer that was as impressive as Fultons War & Peace, but then came Bourbon County Coffee Stout... good Lord.

Pours oily black and heavy.  Like your high school girlfriend, the head is excellent.  Nose is slight bourbon and mild coffee with obvious sweetness.  Perhaps a hint of dark fruit, like fig.

Taste.  I need a moment here.  Taste is superb.  Simply as good as a beer can get.  This beer is dense and no where as bourbony as the regular.  The coffee, which is not that intense, seems to tame that and adds some sweetness to it.  The coffee, bourbon and high alcohol are balanced perfectly.  You would never guess this beer is 13%.  One of my top 2 favorite beers of all-time.  BAers are asking if this will reach #1.  my answer... it better.","Burnsville, Minnesota, USA","sbroome"

3454,"2010-05-13",4.7,"Well, I hate to be giving out high-ass ratings like its nobodys business, but DAMN this was a phenomenal beer. Tried it at the tasting tables at DLD 2010 thanks to someone unknown but awesome.

Pours pitch black with a decent-sized, well-retained tan head.

Aroma hits you with a blast of intense, awesome coffee. But thats not all! Behind that theres the awesomeness of regular Bourbon County Stout - smooth roast and rich chocolate, oak, bourbon, and vanilla. Wow.

Flavor is perhaps even more outstanding. I sometimes find the bourbon in regular Bourbon County Stout to be too much, but in this version, maybe its the coffee, but the level seems just right. Really mellows out. The coffee flavor is incredible, and the base stout flavors of roasted malt, toffee, and dark chocolate fudge really assert themselves and meld together seamlessly. Some very slight barrel notes as well.

Smooth, creamy, and full-bodied on the palate with slight bitterness from the coffee. Not really that boozy at all for 13%, but there is some alcohol warmth present.

Overall, wow, what a beer. Highly drinkable, as downing this is just a heavenly experience. ISO more bottles!","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

Very enjoyable.","Tranbjerg, DENMARK, DENMARK","Habanero"

Deep roasted malt aroma with lots of silky dark chocolate, roasted coffee/espresso bean, alcohol heat and toffee. Theres also a slight nut presence and this is all perfectly balanced by a nice bourbony, earthy oak character along with some slight vanilla. The chocolate, roasted dark malt is very prominent in the nose but the other notes provide a nice complexity that makes this beer smell amazing.

Chewy medium body with lots of silky dark chocolate malts, hot bourbon, deep roasted coffee/espresso bean, toffee and nut. Very roasty up front with a prominent roasted coffee/espresso flavor followed by the silky dark chocolate notes and a very prominent bourbon presence that lingers into a long sweet dry finish. The heat from the beer is mostly from the bourbon barrel and overall, at 13% the ABV is decently masked. The bourbon barrel also gives off a touch of vanilla that adds to the silky chocolate notes, balancing out the hot bourbon/alcohol and deep roasted coffee notes. Very well balanced and very tasty but this beer is just a bit too hot at this stage and will only improve with age. Recommended!","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Coffee mixed in with that original amazing brew that is BCS just didnt seem like a great idea, but Greg Hall has really come to the plate and produced a stellar, smooth as silk, not over the top but brimming close to it, high quality beer with this thing.  So rich, so smooth, so damned delicious.  I bought 5 and know it will not be enough to satisfy my taste buds until we see it again next year.  Produce more of this please.

Roasted malt and bakers chocolate make their way to the front,with bourbon still a major player,and the coffeetrying hard to stay noticed. Has a little more complexity and diversity then the straight BC,,full bodied ,but not thick ,like Dark Lord. Burps are pretty slid bourbon with a little coffee aftertaste.

3454,"2010-05-09",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 20, 2010 Big thanks to Dan for sharing a bottle.

Pours extremely dark brown out of the bottle and sits black in the glass with only hints of mahogany showing through the edges.  Theres a small bubbly tan head that recedes very quickly to a small collar.

The aroma is massive though not extremely different than the normal BCS.  There is plenty of vanilla, chocolate, roasted malts and, of course, bourbon.  The espresso is present but its not nearly strong enough to be the dominant aroma.  Think BCS with a hint of coffee.

The taste is more of the same.  Its got a sweet molasses and chocolate sweetness up front with some heavily roasted malts and bourbon and vanilla in the finish.  The coffee comes out more as it warms up and shows up mostly in the finish.

The mouthfeel is completely decadent, nearly perfect - full bodied but with enough soft carbonation to keep things from getting too syrupy.  Velvety.

As a coffee beer fanatic, this one doesnt exactly knock my socks off, but as a beer lover its fantastic.  I cant say that its a major deviation from the base beer but, why mess with a good thing I suppose.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Palate thick and smooth.  Finish mildly bitter with moderate alcohol.

So Ive had this beer a lot over the years: from the initial black cat coffee stout to random coffee variants, Bosq Lya, honey badger, and now Anjilanaka. (I think I missed Edlel Weisse)  Thanks to Andrew for sharing his bottle of Anjilanaka.

2011 vintage bottled January 2012.  Pours an oily black with a beige head that dissipates quickly, but hey theres coffee in here.  That aroma is unbelievable.  Theres coffee there, but wow there is so much in that coffee.  It starts off with a lot of tofffee/caramel/rich syrups.  The malty bourbon county rests within these notes.  Then as it warms  closer to room temperature that dark fruits: plums, a little cherry come out.  So fn good.  Balanced flavors a lot of the same notes, more wood, bourbon/alcohol.  They arent quite the same symphony as the aroma, but its hard to be perfect in all respects.  I think the Anjilanaka coffee comes close to the Honey Badger, but not quite there.  None the less, this is some amazing stuff.  10/4/9/4/17","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"

Luckily, the beer did not disappoint.  aroma is much coffee while the tast reveals more of the bourbon character.  I sensed a slightly harsh acidity at first, but that seemed to subside, giving way to a this vinous character, especially since the very slight carbonation was escaping, leaving the black liquid almost still for the last third of the snifter.

Body is super rich and the base beer is fantastic, with raisins and chocolate behind the coffee. Overall, another great IS from GI.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
3454,"2008-04-21",4.2,"Rich black pour with just a wisp of tan head.  Dark roasted coffee, bakers chocolate, fennel, and Bourbon greet the nose.  The coffee dominated the flavor with only subtle notes of Bourbon, nuts, and chocolate.  Much enjoyed this.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
3454,"2007-10-15",0.7,"very disappointing beer. The malty aroma was OK. But this beer tasted very...well..yuk.  The coffee flavors were annoying and overdone. If you like cold coffee that has sat in the pot for days..you will love this beer.","USA","mmcdowell3"
3454,"2007-01-09",2.5,"I dont see what all the fuss is about with this beer.  On the possitve side the beer looks good and has a rich malty aroma, but on the flip side I thought the flavor was out of balance(too much malt) and the mouth feel reminded me of thick maple syrip ( I know I spelled it wrong) This beer just was not for me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","stevehousebeer"
3454,"2006-12-22",3.9,"Sampled at the FOBAB 2006.  Giant aromas of expresso explode out of this dark brew.  The taste is dominated by the same coffee flavors and only slight hints of the Bourbon barrel it was aged in.  Not as complex as I would of liked and a bit one dimensional but still really good.  Oh, it seems Ive knocked it out of the top fifty... let the crying begin...","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ElBorracho"

3454,"2006-12-01",3.9,"Bourbon County Stout is in my top three stouts in the world!  (By the way:  note to self:  Please rerate all of your top 20 beers...your list is ALL over the place!)  But I thought this one was way over the top with bitterly strong coffee overtones.  (By the way:  note to everyone else:  Please ignore the wizened old man behind the curtain apparently working my mouth.  Thats just Cornfield!)   Dont get me wrong!  I  still

 thought this was a wonderful drink.   In my opinion though they went a step away from near-perfection with the over-emphasis on the overwhelmingly bitter coffee notes.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
3454,"2006-11-30",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2007 Yowsa!  My friends and I snagged up the last 6 or so servings of this in wrigleyville.  $10 a piece...we did not see that coming.  Anyways, this has an over the top chocolate aroma that you can sense a foot away.  The flavor is rich coffee, almost expresso like, and thick and rich chocolate.  The sweetest most intense beer, let alone Imp stout, ive probably ever had.  Unfortunately, I could hardly detect any bourbon barrel, but I dont think Ive ever been able to notice it on any imperial stout.  I cant wait to have the regular bourbon county when i get home.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"
3454,"2006-11-29",3.8,"interesting...on tap at the wrigleyville location.  Just had the regular bourbon the day prior...and i enjoyed it much more.  10 oz  black pour with no head.  Aroma is big chocolate and subdued coffee.  Taste is similar...except it is lacking some intensity...quite balanced...except it doesnt have that imperial feel.  If you think this has any bourbon or wood in it...you dont drink bourbon much.  Mouthfeel is huge and thick...perhaps the heaviest Ive encountered.","","CMUBEERMAN"
3454,"2006-11-21",4.3,"#919On Tap at the Goose Island Wriglyville Festival of Wood and Barrel Aged Beers November 4th, 2006. First off, what is the deal with these other ratings. I absolutely loved this beer and the Impression that I got, possibly totally all slammed impressions, was that others enjoyed this as well. Black with a thin brown head that is shortly lasting rim. The nose is full of chocolate but that bitter sharp coffee smell throughout. More like an Iced moca. The taste is chewy with lots of coffee, sugar sweetness then grains with a huge end with lots of oak, vanilla and cream with more and more coffee. Surprisingly with all that coffee there is still a nice undertone of oak and bourbon. Good stuff.  Note, after I entered this rating I was messaged by another beer lover, cquiroga, who told me that it was under the old rating. So I moved it here. Better represents the beer here.","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SubstanceT"
3454,"2006-11-08",4.6,"An opaque and impenetrable inky pool of midnight brown lies underneath a dark tan wrung that dances at the edges of the glass. Unsweetened chocolate slabs and a profoundly rich French roast aroma beat the shit out of the nose, and theres not much time to recover before its followed up by dark chocolate truffles infused with caramel, Godiva coffee grinds and flame licked oak planks. Full-bodied, flavorful testament reaps darkly and fluidly throughout the palatary playing field. Dove dark chocolates melt unto caramel-integrated French roast coffee (and by roast we mean roasted to smithereens.) Burnt brownies aid the eurhythmic sequence and then get pressed on countertops to extrapolate previously spilt espresso grinds. Licking those grinds off the bottom of the brownie generates a dark, bitter coalescence to the tongue. Quite a jolting wake up cup, ensnaring the palate at its most vulnerable state. Sweet cream and lactic chocolate are pulled to a halt with the dense, gooey fudge layer. Tonsil cribbage at its most aggressive state. Boozy caramel wraps around Scores bars, and milk duds with bourbon-infused centers. Vibrant French silk pie with a coffee grind crust see us out while a gentle, gooey, caramel sweetness close up shop in the end.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
3454,"2006-11-07",4.6,"UPDATED: NOV 30, 2006 sampled at barrel-aged brewfest. enormous RAW cofee/java smell. tiny bit of sourness in aroma that reminds me of jolly pumpkins impy. very close to java stout in flavor. substantial roasted coffee malts. very full-bodied. sweet but unforgivingly bitter. probably the highlight of the festival.  rerate: sampled at GI wrigleyville for $10 a pour.  super-awesomeness confirmed, exactly as i remember it.","chicago, Illinois, USA","sersdf"
3454,"2006-11-06",4.6,"On tap at FoBAB 4.  This was a masterpiece... pure and simple... if you like huge stouts and fine coffee.  Poured black as night with a light righ of caramel head.  Nose was of very fresh, and very rich espresso roast, coffee liquor, and bakers chocolate with light bourbon and vanilla accents deep down.  The espresso jumps to the forefront in the flavor department, too... and manages to release some heat from the regular BCS... again the coffee liquor and dark chocolates come across, and the bourbon, vanilla, and oak accents are wonderfully complimentary.  Very heavy on the palate, but never became sticky or slick.. coated the mouth well and left a long, roasty coffee bitterness.  Excellent!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
3454,"2006-11-06",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 9, 2010 On tap:  Huge roasted coffee and expresso aroma with some light dark chocolate and just the slightest hint of bourbon.  Dark brown, virtually black, with a small tan head that quickly fades to a ring.  The beer  just coats the glass.  Flavor starts with lots of chocolate with hints of vanilla.  Roasted coffee starts in the middle and builds into the finish.  Light bourbon in the finish balances very well.  I really liked the addition of the coffee.  It really adds to the flavor and cuts into the bourbon flavors making them much more subtle.  A very well barrel-aged beer and my favorite of the FoBAB 2006. (9-5-9-4-19)

Re-rate (6/10/10) Bottle:  The aroma is an excellent combination of chocolate, maple syrup, vanilla, bourbon, and light coffee (lighter than you  would expect).  It pours a dark brown, virtually black, with no transparency and a small brown head that diminishes to virtually nothing over time.  The flavor starts with chocolate, vanilla, and maple syrup.  The finish has some nice coffee flavors, but not as strong as when I had it at FoBAB.  Theres a definite maple syrup and a touch of wood in the aftertaste.  Full bodied with a slick and creamy mouthfeel.  Regular BCS is one of my favorite beers at 4.9, but this is that extra .1 better.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3454,"2006-11-06",3.7,"Lots of folk at the festival raved about this brew, but to me the heavy aroma and flavor of espresso overpowered the wonderful Imperial Stout at the base.  Espresso, roasted barley, dark chocolate, and anise blended together in both, but the coffee wins out.  Dry nutty finish.  Id stick with the regular BCS.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/events-detail.asp?eve of Barrel Aged Beers, Chicago, IL 11/04/2006<font size=-1>","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
3454,"2006-11-06",4.6,"FoBAB 2006. And I thought Bourbon County couldnt get much better. Add Black Cat espresso, and its markedly improved. My favorite beer of the day after the Liverys Weizenbock. Strong notes of espresso, tar, licorice on the nose lead into a fantastic blend of dried cherry, mocha, and fudge. Thick, viscous, impressive all around. Finishes with notes of vanilla and hazelnut.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
