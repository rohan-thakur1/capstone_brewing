948,"2016-11-02",3.2,"Tap. Clear light copper body with a small wispy white head. The nose is slightly sweet crystal malt and a touch of graininess with some minimal hops. The flavor is much the same, a lot sweeter than I would prefer, though on the finish theres a bit of a hop bitterness bite that helps out a little. Light to medium bodied with soft fizzy carbonation. Meh, not a whole lot to write home about, I think Id opt for an Anchor Steam if it were a choice.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

948,"2016-03-15",3.6,"Nice even hops that are heavy upfront and then mellow out. Pineapple scent and citrus enriches this beverage. Full mouth for the hops like ipa style. A little hazy and yellow orange color. Tap","norristown, Pennsylvania, USA","katrinaez"
948,"2016-03-09",3.5,"Draft at Whole Foods PM. Pours hazy straw with off-white head. Nose was pale malt, hops, pineapple. Tasted rich, smooth, with a fairly complex finish. Methinks this beer is mis-categorized, or else it is a very hoppy CC. I truly dont give a shit either way, but I want the purists to lose some sleep. Cheers.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
