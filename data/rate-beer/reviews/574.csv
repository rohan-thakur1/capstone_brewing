574,"2015-08-14",3.3,"On tap at the brewery, pours a murky amber with a ring of off white head. Nose is straight booze, heavy vanilla, heavy caramel, apple juice, some vinegar too. Reminds me of bad Angels Share. Flavor is a little better, sweet caramel and apple juice, plenty of brandy, golden raisin, dark cherries, port wine, lurking chocolate. Full bodied, oily and a touch hot. Could be laid down if it were bottled.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"

574,"2013-08-09",3.9,"Draft. Te pour is a very dark carmel color with thin lacing. The aroma is sweet bourbon and faint malt. The taste is sweet throughout and smooth. The booze comes through in the aftertaste. A nice beer that gets better as it warms up.

574,"2013-08-09",4.2,"Worth the wait! I was at Vintage Brewing company two days ago. They had this beer listed on their menu, but did not yet have it on draft. Fast forward two days and I stop by for lunch (I was very impressed with their burgers and their meatloaf sandwich did not disappoint either!). I sit down at the bar and it is still not on. I was going to leave, but they had a Brett IPA on that sounded interesting (it was very nice) so I decided to stay. While sitting there they put this beast on - bringing a sample to me to try (I subsequently ordered a full glass). Dark brown with a slightly reddish hue. Very little head. Nose is slightly malty with a faint character of dark fruit. Not overly carbonated, but I think thats what you want with a big bear such as this. I dont find any apple in the taste, but the complexity of the parent brew is taken to another level with hints of booze, woodiness and caramel. Very good and worth the wait.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
574,"2013-05-19",3.6,"On tap at the 2013 Big Barrel Tarrarel as Honeycrisp Brandy Dedication - Pours murky cola with no head. Nose is brandy sweetness with some caramel notes and a big malty body. Taste is big and malty with some sweetness from the barrel. Not much more than a whiff of apple, a long with a bit of heat. Slick and medium-bodied.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
574,"2012-06-04",4.1,"On tap at Vintage Brewpub Big Barrel Tararrel.  Hazy amber with next to no head.  Aroma of apple, brandy, dark fruit and some darker malts.  The apple and brandy come through nicely on the flavor and is a nice break  (and an upgrade) from the normal bourbon barrels.  Sweet malt, cherry, oak, dark fruits, candi sugar and yeast round out the flavor bill.  Smooth and tasty.","Oak Creek, Wisconsin, USA","esjaygee"
574,"2011-08-23",3.7,"On tap at brewpub last weekend, pours a pretty red with a nice off white head, the aroma has a decent amount of brandy on the nose with notes of dark fruit and raisin mixed in with the sourness of the apples, the flavor has a good amount of booze on the front end with a sweetness in the finish with notes of dark fruit, not bad at all.","Quad Cities, Illinois, USA","cbfobes"

In contrast to the previous snifter this one fit together much better. Even so Im not always a fan of the trend of just dumping something into a [insert barrel type here] but it works here. Having said that I hope they dont try to do it again with wine, rye, or anything else - one barrel type is enough.

Aroma / Appearance - The ruby red body was semi-opaque with a thick stream of lacing from the heavy ABV. Apple, brandy, chocolate, sweet tarts, and a minor sourness hit the senses with a thick vinous nature.

Flavor / Palate - Apple cider hits the tongue first followed by alcohol. Hot compared to the original Dedication it feels messy around the edges like it is unraveling. More time or perhaps a different barrel would be a better result. Its not terrible but somehow I just found it lacking in the end.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
