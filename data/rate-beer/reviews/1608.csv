1608,"2008-09-24",3.5,"Pours a faint yellowish color with pretty decent legs. Nose of honey dew with that weird jagged green weed that smells like liquorice. No idea what that is called. Taste is spicy, and a faint hit of  creamy white chocolate, and pecans. Nice semi smooth mouthfeel that does have some weight to it. However, not my favorite.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
