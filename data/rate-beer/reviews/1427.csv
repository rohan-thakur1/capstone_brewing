1427,"2017-03-20",4.1,"500 ml flip-top bottle opened with a moderate pop, via trade with Koelschtrinker. Thank you!
Looks: Clear copper red colour; Explosive four finger head with lasting crumpety off-white foam; Excellent sticky lacing with fizzy small carbonation.

Aroma: Very Fragrant Amber malt which can be smelt as soon as it was popped, with strong plums, dark fruits, red fruits, fresh toasts, roasted chestnut shells, strong toffee, caramel, cocoa powder, Cola, sugar, dark bread and light grass. So fresh and charming!

Taste: Close to light sweet Amber malt, with caramel, light toffee, strong burnt toast, Cola, red fruits, floral, fair molasses, strong herbs, biscuits, strong lemon, very strong bitter hops and sharp grass. Wow!

Body: Mid to light body. Slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Solid Amber maltyness in a fairly thick background. Very strong bitterness - burnt toast and hops - hits hard which overwhelm red fruits and caramel. Flowery and moderate sweet, again overshadowed by strong herbal grassy hops. Dry biscuit with strong lemon to round. Strong and impressive!

Hoppiness: Light grass in nose. Floral, strong herbs, strong lemon and sharp grass in taste; Bitterness is immensely strong for a lasting, very high astringent herbal malty finish.

After Taste: Quite dry. Burnt and very bitter to mouth.

Comments: My first taste of a real Alt from Düsseldorf, and I can feel the freshness right from the strong and colorful nutty fruity aroma. The wacky toasty and hop bitterness is unexpected. It is very strong , but its tastier and certainly more agreeable than Nine Dragons Fist of Fury. Very strong and refreshing. I love it!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

USTA : umiarkowanie gazowane o konsystencji tłustej herbaty.

1427,"2014-02-26",5.0,"Uerige Alt is the very definition of German Altbier. Dark ruby color, dense white foam with good retention, malty, complex ale aroma. Clean, intense bitterness with a roasty malt backbone. Other German Altbiers pale (literally) in comparison to Uerige. It is a wonder to me how they manage to export any of their product given their extremely limited production capacity and their popularity in and around Düsseldorf. This is a first cousin to the English IPA´s, but it is has a dry, clean finish, not fruity or musty like the English beers. Microbrewers take note: this is the target to shoot for. no over the top floral hops, no explosion of fruity esters, no scratchy astringency. I challenge all of you to produce anything even remotely resembling Uerige Alt!","Sacramento, California, USA","felsenpils"

Nice dry malty aroma. Looks brilliant - dep red, huge frothy head. Quite weird in the mouth, lots of wood, but strange wineyness, Touch of ginger in the aroma. Crisp palete. Quite active carbonation. Lots of dry earthy hops, maybe soapy, but not in a bad way. Actually quite bitter and sharp, acidic with hop resins. Love the ginger aroma! Prefer the previous bready alt but this is great to.
Rerate: Cask (Uerige, Dusseldorf) (6:4:6:3:12=3.1) 
Deep red, tight head. Dry nutty aroma, but something almost cheesy too. Bready, nutty woody and bitter. Tons of fruity esters, but again something is not quite right here.

With Amon Amarth playing in the background seems like this taste of the great beer they call Altbier started to taste even better. The great taste of Altbier does not change even if you drink much of it, it pretty much stays the same good constant all through the whole experience of the time while consuming it.  Its like the Gods themselves descended down just to bring/brew us the perfect beer. Truly ambrosia of the Gods. First time i tasted Altbier was in Dûsseldorf which was a great city with nice people and awesome beer. Altbier now tastes as epic as it did in Dusseldorf.

1427,"2012-12-19",2.9,"UPDATED: NOV 16, 2015 Draught at the brewpub: Well, it still is the most caramelly out of the four great Dusseldorf altbiers. It still has an excellent, soft mouthfeel. It still is nutty. But drunk on the 12.11.2015, poured from a wooden barrel, it was characterised by an overload of buttery diacetyl and fruit esters. And with that great malting being pushed into the background by strawberry butter, it was a disheartening experience.

First rating: Bottle. Nice brown colour but the head is disappointingly small and short. And that is luckily the end of disappointments with this beer. Dark malts coupled with basement aromas in the nose. Caramelly, toasted and nutty, with dried fruit (dates perhaps?) and a very shy roasted note. Refreshing though rather medium bodied.

As it has passed exactly four years since I got to taste for first time Ueriges altbier at the brewpub in Düsseldorf, its time to do a re-rate of it, from a 50 cl bottle, bottled on 20.12.2012.  And as it happens, exactly four years ago Amon Amarth played at Zeche in Bochum, first out of four evenings, performing their first album, its time to take a stroll down the memory lane and put on the Bloodshed Over Bochum dvd. Good times.

Pours dark amber in color with a nice flufy off-white head. Malty, nutty and perhaps even some spicy hoppy notes in aroma. Taste is slightly sweet, nutty and malty with a nice bitter finish. Highly enjoyable with a malty sweet and light grassy bitter aftertaste.

Straw and grass mixed in as well.  Taste is toasty malt, mild caramel and cooking brown sugar sweetness, and some bitter citrus in the back.  The finish is fairly long, and is the earthy straw and grass from the nose.  The taste lingers, with some mile oxidation as the beer warmed.

The finish is dry with some roastiness and bitterness in aftertaste. The flavor is surprisingly a little watery.  The mouthfeel is light with some spritziness from carbonation. Overall, a bit of a disappointment. The beer seems a bit watered down. It also seems unbalancedly bitter. There is very little bready malt character and almost no residual sweetness - just not enough to balance the roasted malt and hop bitterness qualities.

Out amongst a few hundred Rhenish patrons enjoying ignoring the World Cup altogether, my wife sipped this, complained it was too bitter and handed the reins to me. It was now on!! From an oak barrel in a white tent out front, and into the stunted Altbier glass. Produces a tawny copper, dark, ruddy and bright. Head grows to an inch and ebbs back to a solid spiders web of messy off-white froth that drabs foam all the way down. Big, toffee, burnt sugar, bitter citrus fruits and layers upon layers of fresh hops on the nose. Sweet, fruity, malty, juicy. It continues into the mouth, so fruity, absorbent, juicy and salivating, panting for the next sip. Bitingly spicy, big, ripe fruit flavours, a lot of malt hidden in the depths of this wonderful furore. Its body edges medium and I guess the Alt I got was just perfect for the picking. Its sweet upfront, and undeniably bitter on the swallow. Shows a lot of length both with sweet malts, juicy, fruity esters, bitter, floral hops, wood and even a strange note of mint leaves.

Big roasted taste and waves of bitterness.  I like the character here, roastiness is a nice flavor in an Alt, and this has to be one of the bitterest beers in Germany.  Caramel isnt strong here and is clearly subservient to the roasted malts.  Bitterness is not mouth-puckering, but easily the driest Alt Ive rated.  Creamy mouthfeel with a prickly sting on the tip of the tongue.  I wouldnt call this the most complex of the Düsseldorfer Alts; its more of the strong man, or the pit bull  stocky and powerful.

1427,"2006-01-27",5.0,"Alt bier or ""old beer"" is a very local beer style, that is brewed in and around the city of Dusseldorf, Germany. What makes it special, is the fact that it is an ale, not a lager, and ""old beer"" refers to the fact that the first beers brewed in Germany, were ales, not lagers. Lagers of course, now dominate German brewing, but there are areas of Germany that never took to them. The brewers in Dusseldorf were never persuaded to change to lagers, and we as beer lovers should all be grateful. 

By style, alt is a delicious, copper colored, malty, hoppy beer, that is just so drinkable. Brewpubs and and breweries in Dusseldorf specialize in this very local style, and take great pride in it. Zum Uerige is a brewpub located on a busy corner street in the heart of the Altstadt, and brews what has been called the bench mark example of alt bier. When I entered Zum Uerige for lunch and took a seat, I was over come with joy and great expectations. When one of the Kobes(pronounced kerbiss) or blue jacket, blue apron wearing waiters, came by my table rolling a wooden barrel of altbier past me, I knew I had finally arrived. I have had other German alt biers, and would try other outstanding examples on my trip to Dusseldof, but this beer is without question, still my personal favorite. 

Uerige Altbier pours to a beautiful, bright, copper color, with a bright white head that clings to the glass, and a soft to moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic, with vibrant herbal/grassy hop aroma, paired with subtle hints of nutty malt. The palate on this beer is soft and malty, with incredible clean and nutty malt flavors. As the sea of clean malt flavor ends, this beer finishes with a vibrant burst of grassy/herbal hop bitterness that lingers on the tongue. 

At the brewpub this beer is served by gravity from a wooden barrel. The Kobes circle the rooms with metal trays full of 0.25L short glasses of freshly poured altbier, and will continue to replace your empty glass until you tell them to stop. They mark you coaster each time with a pencil, and when all was said and done with, my friend and I had consumed 11 glasses of altbier(I had 8, he had 3). Uerige Alt is an amazingly drinkable beer that you just cant get enough of. It is so flavorful, clean, smooth and drinkable. The aromas and flavors vom fass at the brewery are just so fresh and flavorful, you really have to come to Dusseldorf to experience the magic of this beer. In the meantime, I am happy to say it is available in 11.2 oz brown swing top bottles, that retail for about $4 a bottle. It can even be found on draught, in select markets at good beer bars across the US. The price for this beer seems a little inflated, but for a classic like this, I say well worth it. Uerige Alt is a very food friendly beer, and would be the perfect match for grilled bratwurst or roasted pork. I enjoyed glass after glass of this beer with some delicious potato soup, a mettwurst, and liverwurst with bread and butter.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Uerige Alt.  (Very Cool) Bottle.
In my Maudite tulip, the head is large and large-bubbled; rather quickly forms a thick coating on top, w/ little islands here and there.  Nice lace throughout.  Colors a bit odd, kind of a mix between a light burnt sienna and a ruby orange.  Even in the tulip, aromas are hard to pick out.  Kinda damp and dusty.  Some wet dog.  Is this really German?  Seems more like a cross, oddly, between certain Belgians and Brits.  Not to stereotype, but the Belgian aspects are nice (e.g. candi-ish), and the British elements are not so nice (e.g. stale bottled beer that probably wasnt meant to be bottled).

1427,"2005-06-20",4.0,"Wow.  A new experience for me, my first true alt compared to some US interpretations aka copper ales, and maybe a sweetish commercial example from Germany.  They call Uerige a homebrew pub and this does remind me of homebrew with its twangy flavors.  Nice earthy caramelized aromas, slightly less present in the palate.  Mild herbal, slightly spicy hop aromas.  But as Ive read about alts and their long bitter finish, nothing could be truer - and thats the real story here.  A long, hoppy bitter finish - and it took some getting used to!  Much more phenomenally bitter than most double IPAs.  While this was novel to me and required some acquisition, Id have to say its a masterpiece in terms of integrating that finish and getting that clean hop bitterness to linger so well for so long. Oh, and it surely was an attractive copperish amber color, fairly glowing in the glass.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

The flavor is more typical of the region - lighty roasted barley with a sharpness in the finish - but the hops (lightly grassy, not too citrusy, kind of dank actually, light but not wimpy) keep the beer on edge and give it a kick that is highly appreciated especially here in the Pacific NW. Beyond this is a whole new range of flavors in the finish - some more mellow nuttiness and breadiness, some sharper bitters from the hops, and a very subtle glow from the alcohol.

Aromas of yummy malts, slated soft pretzel.  Flavor also salty and doughy, a hint of sweet nuttiness.  A bit bitter on the finish.  Super cool bottle, by the way.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
1427,"2004-07-29",3.5,"33 cl bottle.  I was sooo thrilled to find the fable Uerige Sticke, then got it home and found... doh, its the regular Alt!  No matter, I havent had this one either, and the hunts still on for the Sticke.  Medium cloudy maple, firm small off-white head.  Earthy, malty, slightly nutty (pecans, walnuts) and roasty nose.  Nice full body, though a bit overcarbonated methinks.  Malty, lightly sweet front, quite dry and a bit acidic at the finish.  Its nice; I dunno what else to say, get it if you like alts, if you dont it probably wont change your mind.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1427,"2004-07-17",3.8,"LOve the bottle for this one..a work of art.
Now the beer..lovelly looking ale  it is an almost glowing amber with a huge sticky, frothy off white head...great lacing.
Aroma is strong on the malts..some small hops too.
Very soft malty flavour..semi dry finish,, some hints of honey and a small hoppiness at the very end.
Very nice on the palate.
Not the ""biggest"" beer in the world but certainly a top class Alt.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"
1427,"2004-07-17",3.4,"A nice Alt bier that is probably one of the best representations of the style, but not my fav.  I like the Sticke Uerige better.  Very hoppy profile, with an undercurrent of carmel and malty notes.  The flavor is more aggressive to me than that of the Sticke Uerige.  I have tried, but will not purchase again","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","stefanberggren"
1427,"2004-07-14",3.3,"A blood red crimson color with a very smooth creamy amount of carbonation that results in a film of head and a thick ring of lacing around the edge. The aroma is lightly musky and sweet with notes of fig and oak, some honey. The flavor is very malty with lots of base malts coming through and a nice lightly smoky cheese taste coming up. The hops are subtle but balanced and mild. A well made altbier, but Id take others over this one. Altbiers arent exactly what I call exciting.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
1427,"2004-07-12",3.4,"Pours a dirty bronze with a very small white head. Nose is slightly bitter with a generous malt aroma coming through. Hint of slightly burnt toast coming through as well. Taste is a little roasted and slightly bitter with a rounded malt backbone. Its dry and more bitter towards the end, with maybe a hint of unsweetened ice tea. Good beer and surpisingly refreshing!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
1427,"2004-07-12",3.2,"This hazenut colored beer has little to no head. The nose is simple with sweet malt and a dank astringent note (like grapefruit in the basement).

1427,"2004-07-09",3.5,"Clear copper body . The head is quite nice, Big and dense with a steady stream of larger bubbles coming up through the middle.  Glass lacing is also very nice. The aroma is malty, dough with burnt edges. The flavor is also bready but a good dose of bitter hops comes in about half way through. The body is medium-light with a quick uneventful finish. Overall a very well put together beer but it is just not outstanding in any way.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
1427,"2004-07-09",3.7,"Vibrant orange brown color with a small lasting dense beige head. Small head last to finish and leave a nice trail of lace. Aroma of apricots and lightly toasted bread. Fresh and clean nose. Light malt sweet start that continues to the middle. Major turn of events mid quaff. Flavors of apricot pits and earthy hops emerge. they yield slightly to a toasted malt near the finish. and take over again in the linger. A very different alt.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

Aroma of dry hay, some light leather tannins, a bit of metal, lightly bitter, soily hops.  Flavor is dry, old tasting, with those soily hops and lightly doughy yeast taking mainstage.  Plenty of toasted malt in the back.  Body is medium with an unspectacular finish, albeit fairly clean.  Nothing to write home about it seems, but a well-made beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Not as good as Diebels.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","wilkie"

1427,"2004-06-19",3.3,"This is terribly interesting, given my limited exposure to the style.  To be frank, the beer came across not unlike Anchor Steam: a lot of English ale fruitiness beaten into submission by rough bitterness.  Great looking head and profound aroma, though not a smell I particularly like.  Reminscent of a lot of early 90s east cost micros, actually.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"

Aroma is toasty with nuts and caramel with a light herbal hop touch. 
Taste is remarkably nice, very nice and smooth toasty factions of malts, some whole grain goodness, smokey barley seeps, light caramel and unsalted nuts gain and help smooth it out. Great herbal hop biting finish thats just a nudge spicy and holds on to the palate for a good ride. Like that finish. 
Feel is about medium, starts a bit grainy with a solid hold and carbonation but drifts off some to a lighter finish, but thats where the nice hop finish does its thing so it more then makes up for it.
As far as quaffing, this stuff takes the cake, very smooth, a nice balance and meld of subtle flavors. Very delish and drinkable; gone in no time cuz that 11.2 oz bottle aint nearly enough.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

 Very unique Bottle! Ok, Im back! This was such a strange find at the beer store today! Im not really acquainted with Alts but this was rather tasty. Malty up front and then a very dry earthy hoppy finish! Notes of iron in the aroma and flavor yet covered with some oak and a smidgeon of toasty caramelized sugars!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

Clear medium amber-brown color.  Medium watery body with medium-heavy carbonation and dry finish. Light sweet-acidic start, malty and cherry-like acidity.

I couldn't get served in the Uerige Brauhaus in Dusseldorf in November (much too busy and crowded) but I did manage to try it in my old home City!! Anyway, I actually found this to be a rather bitter Alt, which whilst being very proficient, does not match up to my favourite of the style. This is smooth, medium bodied, with a long, dry finish, and a quiet aroma. No head, and not much fizz in the version I had, but a nice copper colour.

From tap this beer is so much better. The hefty sharpness and bitterness are not as prevalent as in the bottled beer. The head was so beautiful, the foamiest head, I´ve ever saw. I could not detect one bubble, the texture of the head was like cream. The tap version enabled me to taste some hints of caramel, a slight sweetness and a touch of fruitiness.
