This was poured into wine glass.
The appearance was a ruddy semi-dark orange to brown sort of color with just a cap of a white head. Alcohol strings of lace.
The aroma starts with a big caramel toffee boozy vanilla sweetness with a fair sweet to semi-spicy whiskey woody dryness. Subtle pomme-like fruits play underneath.
The flavor was all about the boozy sweet malts and pomme-like fruits. Vanilla is an afterthought but somewhat there. Boozy malty aftertaste bringing the heat and sniffing at the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a nice sipping quality about it. Barely any carbonation. ABV felt definitely like an Eisbock. And then on top of it, the barrel definitely provided that extra boost of booze.
Overall, barrel aged Eisbock, damn well it was and one to sip by a fire on a cold Winters night.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

2483,"2014-05-18",4.3,"6 oz pour at the brewpub, noted as aged 6 months in Buffalo Trace bourbon barrels and Smith Madrone wine barrels.. Hazy, deep amber with minimal head and lace. Nose is dark fruits and sugars. Heavy body with light carbonation. Caramel, plum, vanilla, toffee and some raisiny tart sweetness most likely down to the wine barrels. Finish is very caramel-sweet, with some stomach-warming alcohol, but this beers 10% ABV is well-hidden. Fantastic - an eisbock never imagined by German brewer.","Lakewood, Washington, USA","TheRealMGD"
2483,"2013-12-12",4.1,"Deep copper, clear, tan head. Rich and malty with a bready, toasty character, dark fruit, nutty notes, a little toffee, smooth and warming, with an up-front Beam barrel character, but not hot. Marriage of huge Eisbock malty flavors and barrel character is perfect. In addition to the Beam barrel version (2011) I had the 2010 Buffalo Trace, which was similar, but had a little spicy, earthy wheat character and hints of dried cherries and leather. These were complex and delicious barrel-aged eisbocks.","USA","MikeJslc"
2483,"2013-12-08",4.3,"Had on draft at the brewery. There was a big difference between the barrels, but they were all amazing. The Jim Beam was coconut, raisin, malty, fruity, burnt sugar, bourbon, and cherry. The Buffalo Trace was dry, malty, wheat, cherry, with a lot if warmth. This beer and its different barrel incarnations are insanely good.","Bountiful, Utah, USA","Gription79"
