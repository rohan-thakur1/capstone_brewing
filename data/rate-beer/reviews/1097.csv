1097,"2013-09-23",2.0,"Bag in a box at Bree Louise. Pours a murky dishwasher colour, very strong taste, almost unnatural, super harsh appley acidic bite with a cereal aftertaste and nuclear tang that strips the back of the throat clean off. Really not sure if this is meant to taste like this. I know the Gwatkin guys are a strange bunch but this is something else.","Shrewsbury, Shropshire, ENGLAND","minutemat"

1097,"2012-11-24",1.3,"500ml bottle. Tasted more like paint stripper than perry. Very harsh aroma followed by a similarly harsh taste.","Dorking, Surrey, ENGLAND","olliejobbins"

1097,"2011-05-05",3.2,"Polycask at Banbury Beer Festival 05.05.11   Pours hazy silver in colour. There is nail varnish remover & pear drops from the off. Loads of sweet juicy overipe pears but then a dryness in the finish. This has some similarities with the Blakeney Red but not quite the class act that, that Perry is. I enjoyed this but, its a little weird and quite a challenge.   A6 A3 T7 P3 Ov13  3.3","Merton, Oxfordshire, England, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","Fin"

1097,"2010-11-25",3.9,"Southampton rate. Thanks Mes.

Marzepan, toffee, sweet apples, lemon, abundance of candi sugar, 

Really nice candi and dry lemon finish. Good to keep you going.

Thanks, Mes.","Essex, ENGLAND","tdtm82"
1097,"2010-11-25",3.4,"A Mes rate. Cask at the Southampton Arms.Murky yellow with a strange greenish tinge. Although this is called a medium, it has the strange ability of being phenominally sweet and at the same time punishingly dry. Huge sugary pear hint with a really assertive vinegar acidity. It stings the throat on the way down. A strange one if Im being honest. Whatever, its enjoyable enough. I just know for certain that Gwatkin can do much better.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

1097,"2008-06-21",3.0,"Cask handpump. A cloudy straw colour with no head. Aroma is pretty much non-existant. Taste is sour pear, absolutely not medium - quite sweet, but thankfully offset by the sourness. Fairly average.","Greater London, ENGLAND","dj"
1097,"2007-12-08",3.4,"From the barrel, Ludlow Xmas medieval market 2007. Looked like creamy pea soup, stank like a bag of wet sugar that had been stood in an old tart tin, literally chunky pears washing around in a sticky slick lipsmacking suspension. People were staring at me as I drank it, some of the more delicate visitors looked as if they would be physically sick if I drank it whilst close to them. A fun, no-holds-barred perry.","Derby, Derbyshire, ENGLAND","haddonsman"
1097,"2007-01-27",2.9,"Tap, at GBBF 2005. Hazy straw gold, now head and low condition. Low sweet fruity pear aroma with a trace of farmyard notes, gentle sweet pear fruitiness in the mouth and a lingering sweetness in the finish.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"

1097,"2006-01-08",3.9,"Barrel, BGGF 2005:
Vinegar aroma. Very sour flavour. Vinegar in the finish. Very very brutal perry, that reminds me a little of some of the most sour lambics.","Copenhagen K, DENMARK","Mads Langtved"
1097,"2005-12-12",3.3,"UPDATED: APR 4, 2009 Form the barrel at GBBF, August 2005.  At first I wondered whether the ""Farmhouse Medium"" and the ""Golden Valley Medium"" were the same, despite the ABV difference (I noted this down as 7% by the way) but I guess they cant be as they had both at GBBF. This is a succulent and juicy perry with a very fruit dominated aroma. Soft and easy drinking, with a fair amount of sweetness. Very pleasant, if not the most ""farmhouse"" of perries. Cloudy, straw coloured, appearance.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
1097,"2005-09-16",3.4,"Tart, fruity, maple aroma.  Opaque yellow-white body is quite still and viscous.  Tart, juicy pear flavour with plenty of residual sweetness.  Dry farmy aftertaste.
