3993,"2014-01-15",3.8,"Bottled on 11/2013. Pours a very dark brown/black with a light tan head. Aroma has hints of tangerine, coffee, veg, mango, toffee... Medium body, medium carbonation. Fruity to start with orange and trop fruit, then some bitter coffee, licorice, treacle, burnt sugar, dark choc. It finishes with a lightly fruity dark choc/espresso bitterness. There's some boozy warmth too. It's good.

3993,"2014-01-03",3.7,"Bottle - 9% bottled Nov 2013, into a tulip. Black with a decent foamy head. Smell - cheesy hops, mint with some ash. Body is medium, not really foamy, low carbonation. Taste - tangy citrus fruits, cheese, mint, lime, some smoke in the slightly astringent finish. IÂ’m normally put off by cheesiness in beers, but itÂ’s not too offensive here - if anything the hops make the beer light, drinkable and palate cleansing. Good.","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"
3993,"2013-12-09",3.9,"6th December 2013Pigs Ear. Sold to me as a Double Black IPA. Opaque dark brown - black beer. Small bubbly tan head. Smooth dark malt and a little dark chocolate. Light tangy dark fruit underneath. Hops are spicy and piney and also carrying a little citrus. Finishes smooth with more hop spice that carries on well in to the aftertaste. Very nicely done (alleged) blend.",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"
