4325,"2007-02-05",4.2,"Bottle conditioned, 500ml. Glear gold with foamy head. Extraordinary bottle conditioned bitter, really well done. Heavy dry grapefruit, citrus dryness, loaded with a dry late hop. Bittersweet with a chunky fruitiness. Light malt undertone, a very good bottled beer.","Banbury, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","imdownthepub"
4325,"2006-02-14",4.0,"Bottle 28/12/2002
Golden coloured strong in alcohol and hoppy. Smooth on the pale. Slightly bitter lasting finish.","Northwich, Cheshire, ENGLAND","DJMonarch"
4325,"2004-03-13",3.8,"Blimey, this is a bit of a beast. Massive pungent grapefruit hop aroma. Huge citric hop attack on the palate too, but with some biscuity malt and tropical fruit in the background. A mouth-filling body, with a solid structure and oodles of chutzpah. Belligerent bitter finish, maybe a touch astringent. If you like your beers uncompromising and hard-hitting, you'll love this. Perhaps just a fraction too severe and aggressive for me, but a cracking beer nonetheless. 500ml bottle (bottle conditioned) - best before end May 2004 - from beersofeurope.co.uk. Unfortunately, with Coors intent on turning the whole of Museum's output over to White Shield, the future of beers such as this must be in doubt.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
4325,"2004-02-03",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2005 i had this on cask in buron upon trent @ the bass museum:  this aint your ordinary bass. this is what we should be drinking and they should be exporting??? this beer is a mouthful and has got a bite, great malt hop character, with a nice bitter finish. i love watching a barmaid pull a pint from the cask, its exilerating....go, go on, go and drink cask ales, they are the best!","Henderson, Nevada, USA","bitter"
4325,"2003-11-17",4.3,"Bottle conditioned pleasure. This is pure gold boys - drink deep. Fragrant hops of the finest quality. A beautiful mouthfeel - full, rich and luscious. Long twisting bitter finish. You can taste the love and care that's been expended on this beauty. Outshines the hoppy Belgians by a long mile.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

4325,"2003-03-21",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 27, 2003 Three months later, same batch. Aroma started to develop more hoppiness and finish started to mellow. Bottle conditioned. Amber gold, good head, moderate condition. Fruity apple aromas, hops and yeast in the mouth and an aggressive hop bitter finish.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
4325,"2003-02-05",3.8,"Has a good hoppy nose and pours with a good foamy off-white head.  Its appearance is a cloudy reddish colour and joy of joy it has floaters that soon rest on the bottom of your pot.  The taste experience is good.  This is a full bodied, full flavour beer that has a solid hoppy flavour complemented by fruity tones.  Being bottle conditioned it would be interesting to see how it ages...","Ipswich, Suffolk, ENGLAND","nigos"
4325,"2003-01-14",3.5,"Strongly hopped English ale with a good head and typically hopped aroma.  A reasonable beer.","Leicestershire, ENGLAND","RichardGretton"
4325,"2002-12-05",3.2,"This beer is brewed for Tesco Beer Challange. Its copper in colour, with a big, white, fluffy head. The aroma is of subdued hops. A sourish, hoppy flavour. Not as good as i was expecting.","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Joeh"
