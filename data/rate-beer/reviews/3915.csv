3915,"2016-08-29",3.8,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle with a label that reads 5.2% ABV. 
Aroma is fairly gin forward with some light citrus and oak notes with a moderate herbal character, including light juniper notes. Cranberry character is moderate, but its combination with the gin comes off as a bit medicinal. As it warms its less medicinal and more gin and cranberry. 
Pours a hazy red-orange with a small, thin white head that immediately recedes to the edges then disappears. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor is moderately acidic with some light citrus notes of lemon and lime. Hints of wheat and oak. Medium light gin notes, but without the medicinal character of the aroma; just citrus and nice herbal notes. Moderate cranberry notes, but not super strong. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice bu, but not one of my favorites. I like the gin and cranberry notes, but they dont necessarily work in harmony. A bit better at the bottom of the bottle once the fruit was roused.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

3915,"2015-04-22",4.2,"750ml bottle pours hazy semi clear pale pink with small fizzy head. Nose has a great blend of herbal spice, mint, spruce, funk and acidity with some light airy cranberry and berry fruit. Taste is delicate but complex with great gin barrel character of peppery leafy herbs and greens mixed with tart tangy crisp cranberry and pink lemonade. Finishes with a touch of oak, hint of sweetness, and more subdued funk than other De Garde beers. Wonderful.","Hampton Roads, Virginia, USA","JBPortland"
3915,"2015-04-18",4.0,"750 bought some time ago at De Garde. Pours a bright pinkish orange color with a medium white head. A big fruity nose, woody, sawdust. The flavor is quite tart with oaky tannins, tart cranberry, the sourness though meets a sweeter berry flavor that really rounds it out. Overall, lively carb and very drinkable. Lovely.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
3915,"2015-04-18",4.0,"750ml bottle thanks to Doug for opening. Pours out a crisp golden copper topped with no head. Nose is fruity berries some spice and a nice funk. Taste is more of the tart berries and a nice finish.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
3915,"2015-04-15",3.7,"750 ml bottle via trade. Pours a barely clouded rose-amber color with some bubbles around the edge. Plenty of tart cranberries in this, with juniper, florals, vinegar, grass, earth, apple skins, plum, yogurt, sourdough, and something adding a vinous character, although this was aged in gin barrels and not wine barrels. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a vinous, tart, acetic mouthfeel. Interesting and pretty good, but not up to the standard of others in the series.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3915,"2015-04-13",3.2,"Big bottle, thanks to phaleslu for sharing. Color is kind of hazy amber red orange color, minimal head.

3915,"2015-02-04",3.8,"Pours a cloudy red/pink and is topped by a small pink rim that leaves some lacing. Nose is of cardamom, bandaid and fruits. Taste is of cardamom and fruits again but now they are accompanied by cereals. Moderately tart. Body is low to medium and carbonation moderate. Overall a pretty good berliner, refreshing just like it should be.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

3915,"2014-08-13",4.0,"Bottle. Pinkish-orange pour with almost no head. Great aroma of sour lemons, faint cranberries, and fleshy peaches. Strong sour taste puts me off a little but the flavors are great. Cranberry and lemon mostly with hint of peach, vinegar, and light grape juice. Good stuff but would like it better if it was less sour.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"

Bottle: The aroma consists of light sour lemon with a touch of cranberry and must. It pours a hazy dull orange with a small white head that quickly fades to a thin ring. The flavor starts with a quick dose of citrus. The finish has moderate-heavy sour lemon, a touch of cranberry, and a hint of must.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3915,"2014-08-10",4.1,"Bottle: Thanks, Eddie. Super murky, pale orangey & pink-ish hybrid color with a fizzling foam thats gone moments after pouring. Aroma of sharp cranberry skins, vinegar, lemon lacto sourness, & mild botanical floral notes. Taste is not rippingly sour, but nicely tart with a solid cranberry flavor, lactic notes, mild acidity, a touch of lemon, hints of vinegar, & a finishing, dry sourness. Very nice lingering cranberry & berry skin in the aftertaste. Another delicious beer from De Garde.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
3915,"2014-08-03",3.8,"> Super citric acid bomb 
[ Bottle ][ 750ml ][ brainlair ][ Trade ][ Globe ][ 8.2.14 ]
>> Hazy pink pour, minimal white foam. Phenolic/plastic nose, similar to 3F Kriek, heavy salt, phenolic fruit skins. Taste is soft water up front but moves very salty and crazy sour. Sharp mallic acid, mouth watering. Nose cleans up as it warms to bright berries and big floral gin barrel, yellow rose, mint. Taste calms up in the front palate with a white strawberry flavor, a bit green and leafy. Sweet tart extreme acid finish. No wheat and not much lactic acid- hard to relate to a Berliner. 
>!< too much lemon/lime for me","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

3915,"2014-06-13",4.0,"Bottle from the brewery, Tillamook. Pours a translucent reddish-pink, with some orange hues as well. Sunrise in a glass, no head. Gin off the top, and something strangely earthy as well, hard to pin down, slightly musty. Body is very lively and tart, finish hugely tart, puckering, with a lingering citric tang developing that eventually dissolves into a more open woody character. Massively pronounced and complex finish, more than just about any other example of this style. Whats lacking in aroma comes back in a big way.","Eugene, Oregon, USA","ericdevin"
