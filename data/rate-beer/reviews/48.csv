48,"2015-10-02",3.6,"750 ml bottle to snifter. Looks solid; a cloudy caramelish orange with eggshell head that steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells solid too; tart, hoppy, and oaky. Tastes like it smells with a strong but pleasant citrus presence and a bit of salt. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and semi-tart. Enjoyable.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"

48,"2015-07-17",3.6,"On tap at De Garde. 

A: Cloudy gold color with a white head. Low level of lacing.

N: Mango, white peach, salt, lactic acid, some spruce, coriander, lemon and grapefruit rind.

T: Quite tart; noticeable bitterness, very light salt - almost indefinable.

M: Light body, foamy carbonation that becomes biting after the initial wave, and no alcohol presence.

O: Decent Gose. Has more of a wild/sour ale thing going on, so itÂ’s somewhat difficult to grade it out. The Azacca hops work pretty well here, however.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

48,"2015-06-27",4.4,"Bottle. Pours cloudy peach with a small creamy white head that dissipates slowly and laces well. Aroma is not overpowering, but has nice notes of lemongrass, citrus, mango, melon, a hint of cat piss. Flavor is fairly tart, lots of overt hoppiness from the dry hop, a hint of salt on the finish. Hard to believe that it is possible to pack this much flavor into a 4% beer. Fairly substantial body as well.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
