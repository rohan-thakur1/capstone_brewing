4547,"2015-08-09",3.4,"16 oz can: Aroma has got a nice Saaz hop note maybe some Hellertau with little or no malt characteristics. Appearance is a golden pour with a thick white head that diminishes slowly. Taste is quite nice for a Czech Pilsner with a nice pungent grassy hop note and smooth and clean on the aftertaste. Overall, an enjoyable drinker. Cheers!","Sterling Heights, Michigan, USA","demitriustown"

4547,"2015-03-28",3.5,"Ive had this straight from the can and in various glasses. Pale straw color. Big, big head so it must be opened and poured carefully; susceptible to gushing if the can is even slightly shaken. Mild, clean taste of bready, sweet malt; hints of grass and spice. I really like this, glad it comes in pint cans.","Lansing, Michigan, USA","blackflag321"
4547,"2015-02-16",1.7,"Can. Hazy golden body with a big frothy, white head, slowly diminishing  probably because this was a gusher. Aroma of butterscotch and more butterscotch with just a hint of sulfur, toasted grain. The flavor is moderately sweet and moderately bitter. It finishes lightly to moderately sweet and lightly bitter. Medium body, buttery/sticky texture, lively carbonation. Dirty, diacetyl-laden, infected, overly bitter. Looks good, though.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
4547,"2015-01-31",3.8,"On tap: The aroma consists of light-moderate grass, light honey, and bread. Its a transparent gold with a two finger head that eventually fades to a thin film. There is a thin sheet of lacing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with light honey and lightly sweet cereal/grain notes. The finish has light-moderate grass/straw. Its light bodied with soft carbonation and mouthfeel. Overall, a really nice Pilsner. Ive passed on this is cans several times. Hopefully it translates in cans as well as it does on tap.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

4547,"2014-10-14",3.8,"Drank straight from the can in my hotel room. Strong grassy nose, follows in taste, so much grass it almost comes off as skunk... But its not.

4547,"2014-10-09",3.8,"can. pours hazy and almost cloudy pale but bright yellow with a creamy white head offering good retention and strong lacing. fresh grains and cereals, insanely fragrant - flowers, spices, citrus, chewy pils, fruity - white grapes - pinot-gris-like, minerals - touch of sulfur, bright citrus, clean yeast esters - slight dustiness, hint of sweetness. healthy carbonation - prickles a bit, light body - oily, relatively dry, smooth yet crisp spicy-citrusy finish. very pleasant surprise!","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
4547,"2014-08-25",3.8,"Can from Angelis in the U.P. Pours hazy golden with moderate to thick pillowy white head. Nose is hoppy with floral, resiny and even slightly pine-like. More rich bready malt notes as the head dissolves after some time - this is actually when the balance achieves a definite bo-pils quality. Flavor is somewhat hop-dominated with a resiny bite of bitter grapefruit peel. Finishes with a long lasting bitter hoppiness. For the style, I prefer a softer balance of hops and malt that really showcases the purity of the water, malts and yeast but this is a tasty take on the classic style - leans towards the hoppy in a big way, but has a nice bready malt profile beneath.","San Francisco, California, USA","asedzie"
4547,"2014-08-20",3.5,"On tap, poured into a sampler glass. The aroma has a bit of a banana and vanilla note with some cereal, and black pepper. It pours a clear, pale gold color with a white, small bubble head. It reduces to a medium ring with a dusty surface and leaves an abundant sheet lace. The taste is a medium light bitter with a medium sweetness to it. The oily textured beer has a medium light body and a zippy carbonation. Theres tones of cereal, grain, a light citrus, a dry, clean pine and a mineral note in the finish. the pine and mineral stick around with a bit of pepper in the aftertaste.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

4547,"2014-06-18",4.1,"16oz can, thanks to umich03jm, Im pretty sure. Pours a beautiful orange amber color. Perfect thin finger of off-white head, that leaves great, thicker lace. Medium body. Super smooth, kind of crisp, lighter carbonation. Good creamy texture to the full mouthfeel. Supremely swiggable. Goddamn, this is a good pils. Great bready, lightly peppery malt. Some nice light herbal hop to it. Moderate sweet taste, nice moderate bitter. Freakin fantastic pilsener. A wonderful one to enjoy with my sandwich. I had to be careful to not chug this whole thing in one gulp, so I could pick it apart for my reviews. I will be picking this up again, if I ever see it on a shelf. If I had another 16oz can Id have cracked it open right now and kept on raving. Will definitely have to revisit at length in the future..","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

Big spicy, grassy, and herbal hops plus some nice crackers and sugar cookie malt. Taste is malt up front and a big spicy hop bit in the finish. Nice sugar cookie sweetness. Moderate bitterness. Crisp finish, slightly dry. Medium to thick body. Very nice czech pilsner. The big body and extra spicy hops make this more of a sipper which is very unique.

A new Michigan brewery is never something to pass up. This was a Bohemian pilsener with a Midwestern demeanor. While not my favorite beer the fact that it is an affordable can gives it a place in the list of breweries to keep an eye on.

Aroma / Appearance - A rich white head slowly collapses to a thin foam. A semitransparent rose gold base radiates gentleness. Wheaty hops, cereal grains, and a warm loaf of fresh white bread linger in the air like a bakery in production mode.

Flavor / Palate - Creamy sherry, lemons, and bitter oranges glaze the tongue with a burst of hops. Granola and tea transition to a malty finish. A nice finish tastes like dusty book bindings. Id love to try a few more Bohemian pilseners to get a handle on the style.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

4547,"2014-03-05",4.0,"16 ounce can into lager glass, no canning date. Pours fairly crystal clear bright golden amber color with a 1 finger dense white head with great retention that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a good amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, cracker, bread, pepper, light pine, floral, grass, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of hop, malt, yeast ester notes; with good strength. Taste of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, cracker, bread, pepper, pine, herbal, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of spicy pepper/pine bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon zest, orange zest, pear, cracker, bread, pepper, pine, floral, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; with a very crisp malt/bitterness balance and minimal cloying bitterness after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, crisp, and moderately sticky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Czech pilsner style! All around good balance of malt, hop, and yeast ester flavors; and extremely crisp and smooth to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
4547,"2014-02-27",3.6,"Can. Thanks Sean! Lager and wet pils malt aroma. Starts out bitter, spicy and generally clean, building balance from a nice malt base. The hop bitterness is lean and green, with plant-y vibe, a somewhat uncertain character. Raw. Its mostly fresh, pretty lively, and nicely bitter. Id be very happy to have this readily available. Better than many American renditions.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
4547,"2014-02-12",3.4,"On tap. Pours a lighter gold, clear, with a white head. Spicy hop and pale malt aroma. Flavor features the spicy hops with more floral hops as well, pale malts, a bit sweeter than the average pilsener. Its a rather tasty one, though.","Northville, Michigan, USA","flatmatt"
4547,"2014-01-23",2.8,"This was a decent beer but was not unique. It fit the style notes well. Faint grain and lager aroma. Clear golden color with some effervescence. White head. Light palate that was crisp and clean. Slight hops bitterness on the finish. Good carbonation. Standard malt flavors with a good mix of balancing hops. A little grassy but good with food.","The Colony, Texas, USA","kevinator"
4547,"2013-12-22",3.4,"Can from Champanes, 
this beer had a very clear straw yellow pour with a bit of gold and gave more than a one finger white head that receded to a thin layer and sticky ring, there were spots and small fingers of lacing on the sides of the glass, 

I thought I noticed a little skunk upon opening the can, the aromas were light malt, cracker, hops were grass and faint floral with very little to no sweetness, and a little skunk in the background, 

flavors were light malt and bread with lots of hop bitterness, no sweetness, 

the mouth feel was light and crisp with average carbonation, 

a nice pilsener, light and crisp in flavor and on the palate.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"
