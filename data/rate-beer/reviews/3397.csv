Excuses met plezier aangenomen. Deze afgehaald bij mijnbierdoos.be op 18/11/2016. En geproefd op 15/4/2017. Rodenbach Vintage 2014 foeder n° 192 is van uitzicht rood en helder en geeft een creme-kleurig schuim. Dit laatste komt overigens in een normale hoeveelheid en is zwak wandklevend, dit schuim slaat echter vlug neer en verdwijnt, enkele kleine eilandjes niet te na gesproken, helemaal. Toch zijn er een middelmatige hoeveelheid CO2 belletjes van middelmatige grootte op te merken. Het aroma is vooral karamel-zoet en fruitig door de kersen, ook wat karamel-mout en nog een lichte hout-toets zijn op te merken. De smaak is niet verwonderlijk zoet en ook fruit-zurig, allebei echter niet overdreven. Vooral de eikenhout toets komt hier prominenter te voorschijn. In de mond geeft Rodenbach Vintage 2014 foeder n° 192 een volle smaak en hij is ook wat droog en met nog een normale prikkeling is het een lekker harmonieus biertje. De nasmaak vloeit wat uit is vooral zoet en lichtjes zuur.

Initial sweetness in a filling mouthfeel is followed by notes of dark wood, cherries, mild fatness, turpentine and yoghurt. Sourness takes over into the finish.

3397,"2016-11-30",3.9,"Bottle. Snifter. Deep red/dirty brown with medium, dirty white, semi-thick head. Poor head retention and moderate lacing. Strong dry wine notes, along with apples, cherries and berries, which give it dryness and tart character. The apple vinegar/acetone notes are close to medium, esp in the beginning after opening the bottle, you can experience more intense apple vinegar aromas. Beside this, oaky and barrel influence is noticeable, may be not so strong as some ppl describe (like vanilla etc.). Clean, not so intense malty profile - fruity and organic with a touch of caramel. Taste is semi-sweet, its a little surprise, because youd expect dry, tart beer with strong acidic profile and sourness. First sip reveals slightly sour flavors, which intensifies, but later on the semi-sweet character is dominant, but not so strong. It pretty well balance the sourness and tartness. Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation, finish is semi-sweet, cherry, astringent. Light warming is noticeable - due to ABV and acidity. Well drinkable. In general this one is regarded, as on of the state of the art beers, describing sour brown ale. I dont have much experience with this style, but this other level of experience. This one is very good balance, drinkable with strong organic, fruity notes like cherries and apples. Unpredictable and not cliched.","Sosnowiec, POLAND","BlazerT"

The smell had soft sweet luscious apples on top of some caramel to toffee, honey and light vanilla. Sourness is light.
The taste seems more sweet than sour through the previously mentioned flavors. Light sweet almost sour aftertaste runs into the finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fairly decent sessionability about it. 
Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the sourness to penetrate mildly but still some sweetness hits as well. 
Overall, seems closer to a mild Lindemann  s. Sour seems light enough to be a nice one for noobies. Id still have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3397,"2014-10-07",3.8,"2011 version. Pours a dark, ruby-red color, with a decent, rustic, bubbly head.

Nose is full of vinegar sourness, along with fermented grapes and a sharp sting of glue, combined with hints of old cheese, almonds and cherries - resulting actually in a very convincing mixture. 

Has a very smooth mouthfeel, right from the beginning, provided by wooden, earthy malts and vanilla hints. Then the complex sourness hits the palate, including a rich grape fruitiness, which turns overripe during the drinking process. The lively carbonation becomes more detectable, from which the slick, very dry sourness stands perfectly out. Finishes with a long lasting, intense vinous sourness. Very enjoyable, medium bodied and well balanced, with a fruity, vinegar sourness all along. Actually not as complex as expected, but very convincing, successful in what it tries to be.","GERMANY","aleigator"
3397,"2014-10-03",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2017 Since 2009, this unblended Rodenbach is released yearly in champagne bottles, to celebrate the quality of beer matured in the ""best barrel"" of each year.  Had nearly every edition but last years release, the ""Vintage 2013"", drew my specifi attention because of the change in packing (lacquered bottle) and the fact that this one comes from a special foeder, number 149, called ""The Sire"".  Moussy, pale yellowish beige, bubbly head leaving dots of lacing, slowly dissipating in the middle; hazy burgundy colour with chestnut brownish hue.  Strong, perfumey aroma of maraschino cherries, wet oak, caramel, medlar, sweet sherry, overripe plums, pear juice, maracuja, soaked raisins, cashew nuts, yoghurt, blueberries, young Burgundy wine, purple gooseberries, glue-like solvents and dry earth somewhere, hidden beneath this wealth of dark fruits, sour berries and wood.  Very lively, estery onset, teeming with sourish gooseberries, cherries, plums and passion fruit, but with a sweeter apple-ish core as well; carbonation is softish and perfectly fit for a sour ale, mouthfeel is supple, lean and fluffy at the same time.  The cherry- and plum-like fruit acidity dries the palate till the end, but in perfect balance with the apple-like sweetness and the soft, moelleux caramel malt sweetness underneath, resulting in perfect balance, with yoghurty, lactic tartness all around and integrated into the whole to a degree which is just perfect.  Woody tannins help drying the finish against the apple and caramel sweetness, at the same time releasing lovely retronasal oak flavors (including the classic vanilla), in a lush, utterly elegant way; hops serve only as a virtual background feature, providing structure but no bitterness.  Some gently warming, liqueurish alcohol in the tail carries the wood, the caramel and the lovely fruity esters down the throat.  Flemish red, heralded by this famous brand, was the original sour ale long before the American craft beer movement ventured into this style; it is no coincidence that American sours started off with New Belgium after they had hired a brewer from Rodenbach.  This beer is the epitome of Vlaams rood, as the western Flemish substyle of Flemish sour ale (or oud bruin) is often called: it has clearly been sweetened a bit, more so than the earlier vintages - a comparative tasting would prove interesting - but in this case it does not bother me, as this additional sweetishness is applied in an utterly elegant way and accentuates the underlying caramelly sweetness.  Perfect balance of sweet and sour, generous in its oakiness and packed with lovely fruity esters, this is a classic of international stature and a tribute to the incredible gallery of wooden casks Rodenbach cherishes so much.  This not just Rodenbach, but oud bruin at its best.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

3397,"2014-02-12",3.8,"2007 Bottle, slightly out of date when shared at the 1st Shrewsbury bottle swap on 27th Jan 2014.

All four of us enjoyed it: one of my contributions.

I thought it was a lovely mellow brew, the oak aging and time in the bottle calmed down the usual Rodenbach tartness.

Poured that wonderful reddy brown only Belgian sour reds seem to be able to find, on top a thin blush coloured head.

The nose took in sour cherries, cranberries and woody notes with a mild vinegar hint.

Taste wise it showed what aging in oak can do: obviously full of old cherries and sourness it seemed smooth, settled and with a sweet undertone, almost more like cherry pie than sour cherries. A true classic and a beer Im sure will age well should anyone be brave enough to keep any for a few more years.

A delight to drink with other people who appreciate good beer.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"
3397,"2014-02-08",2.8,"This is an enjoyable beer to drink, but it's more of an into beer to sours. Considering the label states two years on oak it should be much more sour. They also call this a red (because of the oak aging) but I get no acidic flavors at all!! This seems more like a sour that was pasteurized and then back sweetened to appeal to the masses instead of the sour beer drinker

3397,"2014-02-08",2.8,"Vintage 2008. Aroma has hints of cherry and red currants. Mild sourness on the nose. The color is cloudy brown with a white head and ok head retention. Flavor is only mildly sour. It's actually surprisingly sweet with black cherry notes. Beer is medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall, disappointing for the price. Not really sour or complex enough for an aged red ale.

3397,"2014-01-21",4.6,"20011 Vat 95 -
The beer pours out with a mid-sized head of tanning bubbles the color of white sand dunes. The head has mild lasting qualities, but eventually settles into a thick scrim around my glass. In color, the beer pours a dark burgundy with touches of ruby. Its body is clean and clear of all particles, but it sits seemingly opaque in the glass due to its darkness. On the nose, this beer screams Rodenbach. Tart cherries, malt vinegar, rich oak, vanilla, leather, and even a touch of earthiness flood the nostrils in funky scents. Caramel makes an appearance as the backbone of the smell, providing a sweet, candied bread quality. The oak is really where the nose shines in character, however, with not overpowering richness that bristles with tannins, coats with vanilla, and eases a light toast into the funky scent of the beer. On the tongue, the beer tastes tart and sweet with a mild bitter tannin bringing balance to the beer. The acidity of the beer is most present at the start and close of the sip, while the sweetness seems to sit happily in the sips middle, blanketed towards the end by the bitters. There is superb balance and rich complexity to this beer. In flavor, it begins as rich cherry pie and leather, this opens into funky barnyard, more cherries, and a healthy dose of oak which brings herbal-bitter tannins alongside rich vanilla to the tongue. The finish is sweet with a final hiccup of tart cherry at its close, and lasts beautifully upon the palate, lingering heavily into the aftertaste with sweet cherry and caramel notes alongside touches of scratchy and bizarrely tasty horse blanket and malt vinegar. In the mouth, this beer feels medium in body with a lighter finish. The beer coats the mouth nicely with a mild carbonation, providing light effervescence and levity to the sip. In mouthfeel, the beer has a slightly syrupy pull to the cheeks while remaining smooth. The barrel definitely provides gripping tannins to the cheeks, and the acidity helps to further pull out the cheeks in a pucker. When the beer has left, the mouth is left with a light pool of acid-cancelling spittle and a slight sticky-sweet resin. Overall, this beer is delightfully complex. Rich oak character, fantastic funk, and subtle sweetness blend masterfully in this vintage. Rodenbach is the master of the Flanders Red, and this vintage ale is a perfect example of that. This beer is a delightful blend of everything that makes a Flanders Red a joy to drink. Vat 95 did very well here.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

A frothy beige head atop dies to a thinner film, loose with mellow lacing. Aromas are big berry flavors, offering rich black and red sour cherries, firmer tartness meets some pie sweetness. Cherryskin, touches of pulpy berry. Firm to big wood presence shows tannic dryness, wet wood, and some gentle vanilla. Gentle Balsamic vinegar, a bit dry and tart. Not bad, offering some bigger, assertive elements. Initial is a bit diffferent, turning the corner to a big fruit presence, lots of apple, touches of vinegar, sour red fruit shows cherry, raspberry, and some jammy sweetness. Lots of oak meets these flavors, dry and tannic, some vanillin enters the equation. Sweet as a firm big fruity element meets those brown and red malts. Some lactic elements start to kick as we turn the corner, more funk and leather elements, some biscuits, some gentle vinegar qualities meet up, touches of brown sugar, brown malt, earthiness. Dark and dried fruit mix liberally as we start to taper out. Still a bit sweeter than Id personally like, offering tangy fruit elements, berry and cherry, as we start to finish.

3397,"2012-08-03",4.3,"Bottle shared with Matt, courtesy of Thorpe429. Thanks Mike! 2008 vintage. 

A: Hazy, reddish brown color with very little head. The head hastily withers to a thin, wispy layer and leaves virtually no lacing.

S: Sweet malts, toffee, alcohol, an atypical scent that must be brettanomyces. I am quite unfamiliar with brett in this context, and find this beer quite intriguing.

T: The beer is decent tasting. The flavor is unusual, but not off-putting, like I feared. Of course, its malt heavy with some nice toffee notes. Bourbon comes through in the finish.

M: Medium bodied with fairly low carbonation and warming alcohol in the finish.

D: A fun and interesting beer. Id have this again. This is a good bottle to share a few ways.

++++ ORIGINAL RATING 26 July 2011 ++++
Rating #2,000.  750 ml corked and caged bottle purchased at Zipps, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Barrel No 230, 2007 Vintage. Pour is a murky golden brown, with a. smallish off white head. Aroma is really soft tart cherry, acidic vinegar, and a very natural woodiness. All aromas are really nicely integrated, all come across as very natural, and very soft.  I really enjoy how ""put together"" Rodenbach beers seem.  The taste is the tart cherry and vinegar acidity. The woodiness is more oaky than the nose suggested, but still is nicely integrated with the other flavors. Palate is medium bodied, lower carbonation level, and clean a vinegar finish. Enjoyable one.   (8,4,7,4,15 - 3.8)","Kansas, USA","theisti"

3397,"2011-07-11",4.0,"750 ml bottle thanks to Jacob. Barrel number 230 2007 vintage. Pours out a deep red hue with a medium white head. The aroma is that massive distinct Flemish sour, some burning sourness but more sweet cherries and vanilla. A sweet oak, vanilla and cherry flavor again with just some and certainly not dominating, sourness. Rodenbach has a very distinct flavor with a brown ale sort of malt, loads of sour cherries, some light very sour elements that are there, vinegar, very nice. The oak didnt seem overly noticeable which isnt surprisingly because this beer would already taste oaky due to the tannin like sour/earthiness in the brew. Excellent. Easy to drink a lot of.

3397,"2011-06-26",4.3,"Original 2007 vintage (""Barrel #230"").  750 ml bottle purchased a year and a half ago at Holiday Wine Cellar ($17.99).  Pours a murky-muddy brown with some red mixed in and with a full finger of beige foam.  Aroma is smoother and less tart/acidic than the regular Grand Cru with notes of cherry, bready malts, dry wood, and light vinegar.  Flavor also leans away from the tart-acidic on the sour scale, having lots of nice semi-sweet fruity jam (cherry, raspberry) along with nice dry oaky notes and hints of vinegar.  A well nuanced and remarkably smooth ""sour"" ale.  (258, 575)","Escondido, California, USA","daleharshman"
3397,"2011-06-24",4.4,"Amazing beer, classic Rodenbach but much more refined than Grand Cru.

Presentation is fantastic, foil covered caged and corked bottle with a classy label. I was surprised to see that the cork was was so small, it only goes about a half inch into the bottle making it pop off quite easily. Pours a great hazy brown/red color with a decent head that fades quickly. The smell is of cherries, stone fruit, malt, oak and light funk/vinegar. The taste follows the scent, but with a tart sour finish that sticks around for a while. The oak and cherry/fruits blend together really well. This is a very good beer, easily the best Rodenbach I have tried.

 Vintage (Barrel No. 96), 750ml into a palm tulip. Reviewed on  01-22-2012.

A - Dark mahogany body with a murky brown and red tint. Very hazy and lets little light pass through. Creamy light khaki colored head with large bubbles. Solid lacing.

S - Strong cherry aroma, followed by some rich malts and oak. Really strong on the vanilla and wood. The finish is lactic and vinegary.

T - Follows the nose closely. Starts off with some bready malts and stone fruit. Then comes the lactic vinegar bite. The finish is really smooth with cherry, oak, vanilla, and a hint of spice. Carbonation is really high, more so than I would have liked. The mouth feel is medium and velvety smooth though.

O - I enjoyed the 2007 vintage just a bit more than this one. Im pretty sure this is pasteurized so aging really doesnt help out a whole lot, but I remember the 07 having a bit less carbonation which helps with the smooth flavors. Still a fantastic flanders.

Flavour is lightly sour, but surprisingly well balanced with sweet tones. Reminding of good balsamic vinegar. Good malty tones, lactic acid accents and the oak comes out nicely. Very enjoyable, more drinkable than the foederbier and grand cru, even though I think I like those better.

3397,"2011-04-14",3.2,"2007 Vintage Oak Aged Ale (Barrel No. 230).  On tap at Capones on November 7, 2010 on our way back from Night of the Funk.

Pours a nice ruby red color with a short light-tan head that doesnt leave much lacing behind. The nose is overly acetic, though behind that there is some oak and light cherries. A touch of sweetness in the taste, but still really acetic and vinegary. Light oak and a bit of tannins.

The mouthfeel was actually the highlight of this beer for me. While I didnt like the acidity throughout the nose and taste, feeling that it overpowered anything else that was there, this was nice on its own. Overall, however, just not enough going on here to justify all that high of a score.

Anyway, the beer seems to have none of that.  Perhaps the aging and/or oak took care of that?  I consumed this beer rather quickly, so I must have really liked it.  Pours to a rusty brown body with a light beige head.  The aroma is sour cherry vinegar and oak laden rhubarb.  Theres a lot of nice things going on in the beer.

APPEARANCE:

Pours light copper with burnt orange and light caramel brown hues. Hazy. 

Head is 2 fingers, pillowy, light tan/khaki colored, and has relatively large bubbles. In fact, color of head and size of bubbles is like injera. Head retention mid length. 


AROMA: Vinous. Sour. Dark red fruit (pomegranate, cranberry, and some cherry). Subtle oak and vanilla bean. Apple cider. Faint sea aroma (ie, salty ocean and seaweed, etc.). Extremely faint chalkiness  much more subtle than most sours.  


TASTE: Tart. Dark red fruit (pomegranate, cranberry, and some cherry). Sour apples. Extremely faint oak. Light graininess on finish. Subtle dark grape juice characteristic in background. As warms up, element of vanilla (that also has faint taste of white chocolate) as well as faint wet stone-like earthiness emerges on palate. 


MOUTH FEEL: Lively carbonation. Only slightly dry - less than expected, which I found to be positive. 


OVERALL: Predominantly sour taste is nicely balanced with some light sweetness. Elegant. Perfect for a hot summer night. Drinks like a sparkling pomegranate juice with light alcohol; feels healthy to drink. Highly quaffable.  Unsure that the Vintage is worth the price premium over the readily available Grand Cru.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"

3397,"2010-06-15",3.5,"Foeder 230; Sampled June 2010
A vigorous pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a dense, long lasting, light amber tinged, tan colored head.  The beer is a deep plum color that shows a brilliantly clear, ruby red color when held up to the light.  The aroma reminds me of a tart, fruity red wine, at least from a distance as I visually inspect the beer.  A clean acetic acid note, without the sharp spiciness that sometimes accompanies this acid, is just about the dominant note here.  It is anchored by a fruitiness that reminds me of concentrated apples, cherries and the afore-mentioned red grapes (along with some berry-esque aromatics).  Oak aromatics add some woody aromatics, a spiciness to the finish (that is faintly reminiscent of a barrel aged spirit).  A long draft of the aroma yields some toasted malt aromas that reminds me of browned bread crust and whole grain crackers, this couples in the long finish with a bright, though soft cherry-like note.

Lightly sweet tasting up front and this sweetness remains through to the finish; the beer is perhaps a little sweeter than I was expecting, though it is not entirely unexpected.  The sourness is quite light for something designated as a special vintage (at least with the direction I would have gone if I was the brewer) and in fact doesnt wholly balance the sweetness.  While this is a bit sweet, it is definitely only lightly so in the grand scheme of things.  The sweetness, coupled with the light acetic notes, brings out some cherry-like fruitiness in the flavor as well as a general berry like character; when coupled with the oak it reminds me a little bit of a super-fruity red wine.  Speaking of oak, this is actually a lot lighter in the flavor than it is in the aroma, which also perhaps makes the light sweetness more noticeable.  The oak contributes light flavors of fresh cut planks, subtly peppery spiciness, perhaps a suggestion of vanillin as well as some tannic astringency and textural interest.  The body of this beer is light enough to be quaffable beyond what the 7% abv would suggest, but does have some viscous body to it.  As the beer warms a toasty malt character comes out towards the finish and there is also an underlying caramelized malt character that is a large part of the perceived sweetness.

My second pour of this sees me noticing a touch of musty funkiness in the aroma and perhaps a touch of ripe cheese character, but these are quite subtle and the flavor doesnt really change much (given that this is brilliantly clear down to the bottom of the bottle this isnt much of a surprise).

This is a touch more simplistic than I might prefer, but it is still a fantastically tasty beer that I am quite happy to be drinking a 750ml bottle of.  Very clean, perhaps a bit too ""filtered"", but still this is quite enjoyable; the filtering perhaps even adds to the refined effect that this beer achieves (even if I prefer a bit more rusticity).  The aroma promises a bit more than the flavor delivers, but in the end the intangibles bring this to a higher level than the individual components seem to warrant.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3397,"2010-06-07",3.9,"bottle, tasted june 2010
dark red amber, smooth almost creamy yellow head.
aroma : mild, balanced, oaky, vanilla , tart, sour, marcipan, red fruits. vineagra. Very complex , mild, well composed aroma with sour notes, wood notes, fruit notes.
flavor is vineagra acidy, also very sweet fruity, also lots of wood. surprising that a beer can be this sweet and this vineagra acidy at the same time. aftertaste is sweet at first then becomes quite acid, burns in the throat. If it wasnt for the acidity the beer wouldve been way too sweet, but the combined package is quite wonderful. Still, i find it a little hard to drink. so flavor gets only a 7.
Overall a very complex beer with lots of interesting stuff going on. Everything is maxed up with this one, and the result is sort of like driving a sports car, not very comfortable, but pretty awesome anyway.
I would love to know how this one tastes in a few years.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Pinball"

3397,"2010-06-04",3.5,"750ml, 2007 ""Vintage"" bottle, courtesy cmillward.  The body is lightly hazy, showing a crimson-merlot tint and capped with a small patch of beige colored foam.  Blobby sheets of lacing cling to the glass.  The aroma gives sweet-tart, acetic balsamic notes, along with a lactic, creamy cheesiness and hints of dried out dark fruits.  It smells a little sugary, with some of those fruits and sweet vanilla barrel combining to overtake the acetic element.  Flavors follow suit, again very fruity and vanilla driven, with softly tart, vinegary acidity showing more on the finish.  Semi-dry and lively carbonated, the body comes across a little too sugary for the style, coating the mouth more than a Flemish red should in my opinion.  Its a good beer, but I think it needs some time to dry out.  It just seems a little flabby at this point.  I prefer the Grand Cru by a wide margin.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

3397,"2010-05-16",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2011 Just had the 08 of this last night on tap. Pretty much the same as last years vintage release. Nice crisp tartness mixed with sour fruit and oaky-ness. Slight sweetness on the back end, but nicely balanced with the sourness. Not as much of a vinegar taste/aroma as the Foeder, but pretty close compared to other Rodenbachs. Hopefully these will lay down nicely as Im getting as much as I can and cellaring them for as long as I can last.

07 version: Great big bottle. Pours a darker red than the other Rodenbachs. Almost to the point it is brown, must be the oak. Smells faintly of oak, and just a bit like the regular Rodenbach. Tastes the same, but the oak imparts something that makes it a bit more sour. Which is fantastic. If this was a regular production beer, or if it didnt cost so much to buy the left-over stock, I would drink this stuff daily. I dont know if I would dare more than one, as the sourness could start to fatigue your tongue pretty quick.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"

3397,"2010-03-01",3.3,"750ml of the bloody stuff. Most expensive bottle picked up on a recent trip to Belgium (knowing, deep down, having eyeballed the blurb and polished-turd presentation at some length, it would probably be shit, but curiosity got the better of me), popped only because its about the nearest thing left in my house to a session beer, so here goes.... . Lazily beading chestnut with a taut ivory drum of head. Arrestingly damp oaky aroma like youve just walked into a freshly vacated vat; added balsamic sprinkles, Feta cheese (on the turn), mildew, cobwebs, mouldy cooking apples. Nothing wrong so far, but when you taste it, the trouble begins. First off, why the sweetness? Standard Rodenbach is nothing like this sweet. Secondly, if youre going to put out a wincingly sweet beer, why further adulterate it with (what tastes to me) like artificial sweetener? That nagging, test-tube bittersweetness  is distracting, and doesnt belong in a Flemish sour, or any beer, for that matter. Yes, of course, there is some rhubarb, iron, groaning old vat and mouldy apple-bobbing interest to this, with the same unanticipated parting kiss of caramel, Weetabix and milk  I remember from Vin De Cereale, but by then the sweetness has already rendered the beer semi-drinkable.

Pours a deep maroon color, effervescent, fading to cola and gold at the edges; creamy, tiny-bubbled, off-white head with good retention and persistent lacing; attractive pour. Sweet-and-sour acetic nose, lots of balsamic vinegar, overripe fruits, and bright oak character; Ive never been a huge fan of this style of sour ale, but the lemony tartness and non-syrupy fruit core hold this together well enough; I can do acetobacter, but the sweet-and-sour nonsense is never something I really enjoy, and this isnt quite dried out enough. Medium-full body; lightly creamy texture, relaxed carbonation, medium-high acidity; pleasant amounts of citric tartness, acetic acid, and loads of sweet-and-sour notes; this actually seems more rounded and more oaky in the mouth than what I (vaguely, its been awhile) remember of Rodenbach and the Grand Cru, which at least benefit from a prominent fruitiness; this shows a great deal of leather, tobacco, and hints at much darker fruits at the core; the texture is a touch heavy, the sweet-and-sour without sufficient acidity and carbonation Ive never understood, and you can tell that a great deal of love and time went into making this beer; Id like to enjoy this beer more than I do, and I wish most other beers went through a tenth this much time and patience; without the acidity, lively carbonation, and citrus presence, this is just a sweet-and-sour Belgian balsamic vinegar beer to me.

How: Bottle 750ml.  Tasting session with Montreal crew.
The look: Partly cloudy redish-amber body topped by a very small off-white head
In long: No need for description here, we all know and love the regular Rodenbach products.  This one has a body as thin as the regular Rodenbach.  Sourness level is in between regular Rodenbach and the Grand Cru.  Unlike the rich and complex Oak/cherry sourness of the Grand Cru this one is more simple vinegary.  Oak is a lot more discreet than in the Grand Cru.  Feels much sweeter than other Rodenbach products.  Lacks the cherries and tannins of the Grand Cru, here it is more sweetened dark grapes and other fruits.  A lot less tasty than Grand Cru.  If you expect a Rodenbach Grand Cru quality or something standout from this special Rodenbach release youre in for a major disappointment.

3397,"2010-01-24",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2015 My Bottom Line:
Toasted wood and mustiness rise within the caramelized cherry flavors, aptly cut by balsamic vinegar notes, sculpting a pleasant Sour Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the misty dark red.
-The caramel-butterscotch presence could be too much for some.
-Carbonation is more relaxed than I expected.
-Leather aromas are there as well.
-Wooden dryness is perceptible, but by no means dominating.

3397,"2010-01-16",3.5,"UPDATED: SEP 7, 2011 750mL bottle shared by PilsnerPeter, thanks Pete. It pours a clear amber-brown color, filtering apparent with no sediment at all.  Aroma has a sourness but it comes off cheap.  Take some filtered cherry-Flanders sourness, mix it with alcohol, and some cleaning product and you get a cheap imitation of a Flanders sour.  Flavor is more of a cider-like sourness but again an empty flavor, one sided, filtered and cheap.  Pretty unimpressive, I would much rather drink any other Rodenbach product. 7/3/73/14.6th beer of blind tasting.  Appearance is copper/orange/amber mix, no head.  It is thick looking with medium clarity.  Aroma is an earthy-sweet-souresque, some light overly wild or off-putting brett (in hindsight feral/goats-oil), and sweetness covering it up.  Flavor starts with candy sweetness, which is nice.  Then sourness breaking through and wild character I get on the nose.  It is good but something is slightly off for my tastes.  7/3/8/3/15, Standing in the tasting: personal  tied for 4th, overall  3rd    Final ratings is a combination of the two.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
3397,"2010-01-15",3.7,"Bottle:  Nose was very flemish red-like with heavy sweetness, balsamic, red table grapes, and a vanilla touch of oakiness.  Very strong though...and piercing with the vanilla notes growing deeper with time. Dark, gleaming red-raped amber beer, frothy yet thin light tan head.  Flavors are sweet, tart, and grape-like.  The oak is not too forward but lends a hint of vanilla to round out the sweetness. Finish is clean and tart hinting at grape skins.  I used to love flemish red styled ales, but now I find them excessively sweet as well as lacking complexity...were there some funk or stronger accents of the wood aging, it would have been better...but its just so sweet that I cant really even tell the difference between this or any other rodenbach or duchesse or all those like-tasting reds.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
