2522,"2015-02-09",3.2,"On tap. Pours a clear brick red with a frothy off-white head and light carbonation. Aromas are fairly light though caramel, flowers and raisins come through. Taste is much the same though lifted by a fruity hop note in the mid-palate. Wouldnt have picked it as low a.b.v. Could easily pass as a regular red/amber. A little one-dimensional but very easy drinking. Quite liked it.","Camp Hill, AUSTRALIA","Jado"

Wow, now this is something completely out there!
Amber sort of beer, rocky head holds on.
Hop aroma is just HUGE, almost go as far as to call it more intense than the Icon; resiny, ripe fruits, pine, woody spice, pepper, and not to outplayed, theres still a good punch of toffee and nutty malt underneath.
Body is really where this beer is astounding; unbelievably full bodied, chewy malt texture, with decent length. Youd swear the beer was at least twice the abv!
Once again, I really cant help but think of the Icon when sipping it, the hop character is off the chart, so resiny almost sticky, malt drops away maybe a bit quicker than the Icon, but bitterness is just as high lingering unabated for an eternity, somewhat aggressivel so.
Very special beer, almost too intense to be considered a sessionable beer, but at light beer strength you certainly could have a big session on it...and probaby wreek of hops for a week...","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"
2522,"2011-07-01",3.1,"On tap at Local Taphouse Sydney. Not sure if this is an American Pale Ale but it does have a lot of flavour for a very low alcohol beer.  Solid copper colour this is not bad.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"
2522,"2011-05-30",3.0,"Draught at The Local Taphouse in St Kilda (Melbourne). Difficult to get these beers right when playing around the margins. This just doesnt quite get there, the body just being too thin.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","TheGrandMaster"
2522,"2011-05-10",3.0,"(on tap at Taphouse Syd) Pale ale or some take on an English ale? Mild style and perhaps low ABV. Light caramel malts and some low impact herbal hops. Theres a slight rusty mineral touch nods to an IPA but to be truthful I cant reall pick the style. (later learnt of the the 2.8% so in this context a stunning low abv beer)","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"
2522,"2011-05-07",3.2,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2011 Tap. Quite a full hoppy nose. In the mouth it is reminisant of tea with a slightly muddled hoppy finish. I think this would be sharper and more impressive when it was first released, not a month down the track. Enjoyable.","JAPAN","jonno"
