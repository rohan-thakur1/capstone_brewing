Eww, thats a sour aroma. Dark and sour is a combination I detest. It is dark, almost black, tight keggy tan head. For the strength, a very moderate palate, full and with keggy carbonation. Taste is interesting, a mix of a deep roast, even some dry burntness, a sweaty salty sourness, liquorice, and finally, as you swallow, some pure spirit. Vodka, but a good vodka, not a shitty one. Sourness appears as something more crotchy in the taste, which in a perverted (orval-loving) way isnt so offensive, in fact its interesting - I would just like to know whose crotch Im tasting. Finish biting, both from burntess and carbonic acid, but more happily from some nice dry bittering hops.

Nose has a beautiful floral aroma, sniffed the cap on this and got a nice mental image of when I sat in the lavender fields in summer in Hokkaido with bees lazily buzzing about the business of making lavender honey. The arome coming off a properly poured cup has citrus, pine and a tangerine-like fruitiness to it.

Mouthfeel is light with pronounced carbonation balancing a ponderously darkly roasted malt body. The palate is briefly allowed to appreciate this properly and judiciously malted ale before it is whisked away to decipher all kinds of herbaceous, pine-like, resinously bitter hop flavors.

The finish is hyssop bittter, prolonged and pronounced. Again, one of those hoppy finishes that reminds me of survival camp when I had to chaw on a mouthful of fir needles. Yes, we were told they were full of vitamin C, but it didnt change the fact that they were inhospitably bitter.

On the palate, again fresh brewed coffee to the fore, lightly sweet dark malt and chocolate behind, and more of that lovely earthy pine forest hop character building into the finish along with a discrete but moderate roast coffee character. Again, some citrus hop character showed up in the finish when warm as well. Not at all ashy. Medium bodied but creamy, again seemed like nitro, no alcohol heat at all for me. The emphasis here seemed to be on the side of coffee rather than IPA, but hop character was a good match for the style if not super forward.
