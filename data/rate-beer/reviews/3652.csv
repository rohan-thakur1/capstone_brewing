3652,"2015-10-24",4.8,"Geproefd tijdens Borefts 2015 van de tap. Mijn hoge verwachtingen van de bieren van Hair of the Dog, worden gelijk ingelost, wat een smaakbom. Zeer donkerbruine kleur met vrijwel geen schuim, slechts een paar beige belletjes.
Het aroma is zeer rijk en zoet met tonen van; donker en gedroogd fruit als dadels, vijgen en pruimen, vanille, hout en krachtige bourbon tonen van de Heaven Hill barrels. Echt een smaaksensatie, perfect in balans tussen zoet, licht zurig met vele complexe smaken in het pallet, vanille chocolade, maar ook tabak en oude eiken vaten, met een krachtige alcoholische finish van zachte Amerikaanse bourbon. Voor mij echt de topper van de bieren die ik heb mogen proeven tijdens Borefts 2015.
