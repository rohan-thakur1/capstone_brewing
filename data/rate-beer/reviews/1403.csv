1403,"2017-01-07",4.2,"330ml bottle. I feel like I have to add a note about the bottle before anything else. For some reason the long necked swing top bottle gives me a very good feeling about this beer. The design just screams craft and quality to me, and here I was thinking I didnt really care much for the visual presentation. The beer itself pours shiny dark brown with a redish hue and moderately lively two finger lighter brown head which slowly sinks down to form a more solid one finger head leaving plenty of lazing behind. The aroma is dominated by caramel with some light roasted notes, brown sugar, sweet brown bread and a slight nuttiness as well as refreshing citrus hops with almost a hot and spicy touch and a light promise of warming alcohol in the background. The taste is malty and somewhat sweet with caramel and nuttiness up front, followed by dried fruits and light hops adding some orange flavours as well as a light bitterness and finally ending in a beautiful mixture of everything. Smooth yet filling mouthfeel, light carbonation and aftertaste combining caramel sweetness and hop freshness in a fantastic way. This might be one of the best beers Ive had to date. It is not at all the most bold or complex in aroma or taste, but it comes together in an absolutely fantastic way. This is pure quality.","Lund, SWEDEN","axl"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big raisin, plum, fig, date, pepper, pine, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, dark bread, light chocolate, leather, tobacco, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, fig, date, pepper, pine, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, dark bread, light chocolate, leather, tobacco, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Moderate amount of herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, fig, date, pepper, pine, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, dark bread, leather, tobacco, and herbal/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy/spicy hop flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, moderately sticky, and fairly creamy/slick mouthfeel that is great. A fair amount of dryness from bitterness against the sweetness after the finish. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an incredible imperial altbier style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and earthy hop flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. The designation as Germanys Barleywine for this beer is really a spot on interpretation of how it tastes. Seems to be in between English and American versions of the style; as it has a pronounced amount of hoppiness/bitterness, but also a lot of fruity yeast and malt complexity.

Potent, not for everyone. Very similar to a Doppelbock. Feel is full, texture is sticky, carbonation is average, and the finish is long and strong.

This one was oxidized and because it was I am not going to do a review but I want to tell about that. The cap on the first beer popped when the seal was loosed. This one made a ""fffffft"" noise and threw up a bit of fizz. Bad sign I thought. The nose shows a bit of a flatness to the scent that the first one did not have at all. The taste has a bit of cardboard in the middle of the beer. Its like there is a sour bite just under the beer that does not belong there and the taste of the cardboard is flat. The bitterness that I am tasting may be from the malt and not bad in and of itself but together with this cardboard taste and the bit of sour, this beer is definitely not at its best. I am disappointed but I would highly recommend that you try these authentic beers when you see them. One at a time of course so you are not out a fantastic amount of money if they are all bad.

Some chocolate flavors, malt is overwhelming in this, just to the point, in which fresh carbonation steps in, which gives you a refreshing feeling. In the end alcohol is present for a short moment, but gets wrapped up by the long staying malt. This has a really intense taste for a german alt, malt is really dominating my tongue. The hoppy freshness from the aroma comes out just little bit, but is at no moment stronger than the malt. It just adds a decent bitterness to the established taste of big malts, which creates a nice complexity.Long malty ending. While the ""Uerige Sticke"" has still lots of hops in it (compared to the ""Schumacher Latzenbier""), the ""Doppelsticke"" is really a complex malt-bomber.

1403,"2013-11-17",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 24, 2016 33cl freshish fliptop, danke Thirstybird. Obviously a quality offering with an unfathomable mixed complexity of a barley wine and malty old ale: rich milk chocolate liqeurs, red dried fruits, older molasses mix in with a dry, autumn leave palate and leafy Saphir hop elegance. A lot to experience, taste and admire, a tad harder to love outright. Definitely a post-prandic sipper, probably fit for culinary use and aging. // Aged 33cl bottle, from 2013 batch, opened. 09/2015: plum wine, sugary fig jam, monothematic barley wine with a herbal hopbiitter finish. Goes, as suspected, nicely paired with food and particularly well with blue cheese. // Rerate aged 2014 bottle in 2016: deep woodiness, joining a nice ""upfront depth"" of Alt wood and dry barleywine caramels.

Lots of toffee, sherry, almonds, hints of cocoa and heavy caramel. The flavor is very much like a barleywine with more nutty sherry notes amidst fairly strong bitterness but no hop flavor.

Palate : Carbonation is fairly soft. Big rich mouthfeel. Sweet finish with solid bitter backbone.

Overall : Interesting and quite tasty. Packed with flavor. A sipper for sure. I think this is missing some balance and harmony.

1403,"2012-04-24",3.9,"March 2010: Tall thin brown flip-top bottle, poured twice into a Frankenheim Alt glass. First pour the beer was clear, second murky.

Deep, dark reddy brown body with a lovelly velvet/silky feeling tan coloured head.

The smell was of lighty burnt malts, with some harsh chocolate blocks added to take away the charcoal thoughts my nose began to get. The aroma sweetened as the beer warmed.

The malts fill your mouth with bitterness from the burnt aspect mentioned in the smell. The alcohol then burns into the tongue and the chocolate turns into a more bitter mouthfeel than it hinted in the aromas. This adds to the impression of the beer being really bitter, which it is at first, but as your mouth dries a warming richness arrives bringing a sweeter aftertaste.

Pleasant, herbal and brief. Once poured the beer reveals itself to be of a clear, dark brown variety with a medium, tan head that laces the glass heavily and shows decent retention. The aroma after pouring is different. There is a yeasty note with a faint sourness but I also detect aromas of herbal hops and some syrupy malt that does not dominate the aroma as it would do in for example a doppelbock. When tasting the beer it seems all the flavour ingredients are still present along with notes of dried fruit in an pleasant and smooth, amalgated form with not much of an alcohol bite.

Pours a very dark brown, ruby color. Lots of thick yeasty chunks. No head in this bottle, possibly from the age. Aroma is of white cheddar, dark chocolate, caramel, candy sugar, dark stonefruit, ovaltine, and sorghum. Taste is of  caramel, candy sugar, chocolate, butterscotch, slight hop bitterness, alcohol, bread. Its a very heavy flavored beer, very thick, not in mouthfeel but in flavor. Mouthfeel is very, very nice. Fantastic beer, the aroma on this beer is my favorite thing about it. 
-------- off this beer is extremely complex, very huge.   This beer pours an amazing dark hazy red color with lots of chunks.  These chunks arent big but very small and distributed throughout the beer, not all settling at the bottom of the glass(by chunks I mean this beer is unfiltered)(as all beer should/shouldnt be?).  The aroma is of sweet malts with caramel notes, seemingly from the roasting, along with very light chocolate notes carrying a bit of bitter(haha).   Also has some sour notes at the very beginning of the beer.  Taste begins with a cherry note with a slight sour  note.  Turns into a very sweet malt note finishing with anise mixed with perhaps caramel.  There is a note or two that are funky and throwing me off.  Might have to come back to this one.  Great beer, just need to try it more than once to get it down to a science, fantastic.","Sevierville, Tennessee, USA","BadAprilia1000"

Really tastes like a top fermented version of a doppelbock, though.  Aroma is sweet, caramelly, malty and a hint of tannin.

Taste is similar but with a more musky, leathery and smoky redwood taste.  

Not a style I particularly favor, but if you like high-gravity, strongly malted beers, this is a well balanced, interesting brew.  Not cloyingly sweet, but definitely a malt-forward beer.","","alexjucla"
1403,"2011-04-22",3.9,"Bottle picked up at Chevy Chase in DC. Served in a pilsner glass.

Pours yields a deep molasses-colored brew with a good off-white head with good retention. Lacing sticks to the sides of the glass in a spotty fashion. The nose is incredibly rich with dark fruits, molasses, brown sugar, and some caramel. Its nearly a cross between a doppelbock and an eisbock. Really insanely enjoyable. The flavor doesnt back down, presenting a really nice fruity presence along with a touch of booze in the background. Mouthfeel is quite nice, but fails a bit in the finish. Good medium body presents itself well, but theres a bit too much bitterness in the finish, wiping away the beautiful flavor. Really quite drinkable. A solid hit on the best of Germany list.

1403,"2010-11-08",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2011 Bottled on 6. October 2010, into baby Chimay (180ml) chalice. Pours murky, deep coppery to bronze body topped by light tan, frothy head that slowly recedes. The deep nature of color probably results from usage of additional chocolate and/or black malts. The nose is loaded with rich malty sweetness with toasty notes, tons of fruity esters of plum, prune, raisins and figs, slightly spicy from usage of noble hops with citrus rind notes, brandy like alcohol. The assertive hoppy bitterness is counterbalanced by rich malty flavor with toasty notes; dark fruits are lesser than in the aroma; peppery noble hops flavor with strong citrus rind notes and intense bitter finish that lingers for ages. The brewer claims caramel malts containing complex sugars have been used in this one and thats reflected in rich malt flavor and fullness of the body with less attenuation. Creamy and velvety smooth, verging on being syrupy with soft carbonation. The lagering of this basically an ale has nicely smoothened the beer without taking away any of its complexity.

In short: a complex, fruity, bitter yet malty lagered ale.","SLOVENIA","EvilBuddha"

Much more hit-you-in-the-face than the regular. On the pour, a nice layer of light creamy head, that mostly dissipates, a medium thick body, and dark copper in color. A full, creamy mouth feel here with a nice kick without any hint of alcohol. Also, fairly warming. Slightly hoppier than the regular, and with more of a fruit aspect to it.

Taste is the malt, full and cereal grain sweet, followed closely by a licorice anise flavor that was surprising, but not unpleasant. As it warms, this yields to a softer almost soy taste, that also turns quite dry in the finish. The dry finish reveals a bit of the alcohol heat.

The flavor is mostly sweet doughy malt. It has a vinous and near-brandy quality. Its not as rich as a straight malt bomb. There is a much more delicate quality, particularly in a fruity yeast, ripe plums and bananas, and mineral to earthy hops. I guess there are probably sweet notes of caramel and chocolate lurking, but the sweetness comes through more in a barleywine flavor than most highly malty styles. The beer is a bit sticky sweet. Dont get me wrong. I certainly wouldnt recommend this as a session beer. In fact, it may be getting more difficult to drink as I go through the bottle. Its a lot of sweetness.

Excellent looking dark ruby color that almost appears to be black. Four finger tan head with abit of retention that fades down to a nice thin foam with excellent lacing.

Nice dark malty smell. Hints of dark fruits. A touch of hops.

Caramel maltiness, front and center. Toasted wheat mingles with dark cherries, figs and over-ripe grapes. Very slight hop spiciness on the back-end.

Feels quite nice in the mouth. Could be thicker and heavier (for me) but its definitely not too thin. Mmmm.

Great nutty, raisiny, slightly spicy flavor. Very earthy and much more like a harvest ale/barleywine/etc than I expected. Great beer. Ends with a nice bitterness akin to less hoppy IPAs. Dont misunderstand me, you arent going to get big citrus and flower notes in the flavor, just a nice bitterness to round out all the heavy maltiness.

2 fingers of rye bread head topping a huge root beer body with a little carbonation and a solid seam. Quite impressive.

A little metal off the top but this goes away quickly. Sweet doppelbock/sarsparilla scent. Slight pepper notes accompany this complex concoction. Not your babydaddys alt.

Thick, syrupy ups...malt is huge, malty, thick and formidable. Backbone has depth with a peanutty/caramel feel to it.

My first impression is that its bad and must have been mishandled.  Very sharp on the tongue, bitter acrid bite covers everything else and lasts on the top og the tongue. A little bit of sweetness and raisin tries to peek through.  As it warms, it loses some of the edge off the bite, but still has an overwhelming leafy/woodsy bitterness.  As it warms some more, a dark chocolate and raisin flavor, along with a dark roasted malt compete with the bitter edge.  More alcohol becomes evident on the nose and the palate.

1403,"2007-11-08",3.1,"In short: Weird perfumy floral malty beer of some kind.  Intriguing. 
How: Bottle, almost one year old.
The look: Cloudy copper-brown body with a short-lived beige head.
In long: Aroma is unusually floral for an Albier, almost perfume.  Very yeasty beer with a bubblegum aroma and flavour (purple grapes bubblegum to be more precise).  Rather sweet with .  Liquorice, caramel and lost of spicy hard-candies.  A little peppermint and a little medicinal flavour (cough syrup?).  Really full body, sticky and resinous.  Strong but weird bitterness.  The hops came out as garden flowers (lilacs mainly) and a little piney.  I believe this was my first bottle of this well-known beer.  Certainly not what I expect from an Alt.  Was it because of the almost one-year of age but something just wasnt right here.  The potential was there but it was all over the place.  A weird beer through and through.  Looks great as a candlestick though and the only reason Id buy another bottle is to get a matching pair.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Nose is great and rich; burnt brown sugar notes, toffee, caramellized dates, light wood notes, and some spicy, floral hops.  Flavor is much of the same with a moderate bitterness; burnt wood, burnt caramel, vanilla, molasses, date, and lightly floral/spicy hops.  Palate is nice with a moderately full body, a lively carbonation, and a silky smooth feel.  Finishes long and bittersweet with molasses, almost some chocolate, date, lingering spicy hop notes, with a bit of floral still there.  Takes the great attributes of a strong Alt and of a doppel and creates a great, unique beer.  Awesome, rich malt tones with a balancing hop presence.

Theres a slight leather note poking through, which actually works well and adds to the aroma.  Taste isnt quite as good to me, but it still has a lot going on.  Caramel and raisin flavors abound with some bitter citrus, almost grapefruit flavor thrown in.  Finishes becomes a bit dry and woody, with a slightly burnt aftertaste.  These hops have definitely held up well and pretty much dominate the flavor and finish.  The beers just shy of thick, but it lacks creaminess.  Just a bit too slick and oddly still too carbonated.

Not quite a beer a day, but all in all, not a bad showing for my geographical location these days. Alcohol vapors. Rich and malty, with dusty grain and bitter resinous hops note. Has the characteristic Düsseldorfer Alt aroma - kind of earthy with some bit of funk that I cant put my finger on - mild but its there. Nice malt sweetness. Deep amber brown clear with medium off-white foamy lacing head, not quite creamy. Medium-heavy watery body, but theres a nice softness to it. Medium to light carbonation. Starts with medium-heavy malty sweetness. A bit of raisin and dark brown sugar, caramel. Good alcohol presence with some warming burn on the way down. The finish comes in with a nice bitter quality. Neither fruity or herbal, though there is a bitter nutty dryness to it that cuts the sweet malts and potentially a cloying sweetness that would otherwise persist. Theres a bit of herbal essence in the very end, leaving you with a dry bitterness on the tongue and a bit of sweetness on the sides. Heavy but a nice beer.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"

Flavor: Caraml and chocolate malt with some fruit (pear and apples) and alcohol.  The finish is dry, roasty, and has a lingering bitterness (moderate in strength).  There is a warming and burning alchol sensation through the nose, so the 8.5% ABV is obviously there.
Palate: Medium to full body and smooth.
Overall: A solid altbeir with a nice complexity.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

Altbier is one of my all time favorite beer styles, and Uerige has set the bar very high when it comes to alt, and its bigger, brawnier, brother, sticke. Leave to Uerige to go even higher with the first ever ""doppel sticke"" which is an even bigger version of sticke. This beer pours to a beautiful, bright, deep copper color, with a thick, creamy, white head, and a moderate carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic, with lots of big, pungent, spicy/herbal hop aromas, and some toasty nutty malt aroma. The palate is slick on the tongue, with really great, toasty/nutty malt, paired with some nice fruity notes, on a smooth, and clean body. Doppel Sticke finishes with those great malt flavors up front, then ends with a zesty herbal burst of hop bitterness that lingers. A super charged up version of altbier, I loved this one.

Whoa, holy crap! This is one tasty treat. Bold, rich, and invigoratingly thick. Soft, yielding front of caramel malts. Breadyness and dull molasses, plummy tang insues from there, building, and building, and oh my what a great finish. Warm sherry notes blend into the backgound of a solid base of caramel. Barleywine-esk in character along the finish. Warm, thick, chewy, and lengthy. Hops add some depth with a leafy semi bittering pineyness surrounded by the caramel warmth. Quite nice.

Feel is based in malty richness. Smoothly rounded and warming with one firm thick/medium body thats forever giving into the finish with a wonderful warmth of caramel chewy stuff.

Properly crisp, creamy as well, toasted cherries and plums noticed, with a dry char flavor throughout that is really nice.  I like the idea of this beer, a double altbier basically, and I love the flavor and palate even better.  One of the best beers I’ve had in a while.


After another bottle it hit me - doppel altbier is just like barley wine... toasty, sticky sweet malts with a big hop scent and good bitterness... seriously, drinking this thinking ""barley wine"" and you’ll get it.  Still, one of my favorite beers ever.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

1403,"2006-08-11",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2007 11.2 oz bottle shared with hezron and malachi

I got this from my Secret Santa.  It looked interesting, especially with the
   flip top design so while bottling some wedding beer, we popped it open.  It
   is pretty unique; the label is spot on is describing this as a German attempt
   at a barley wine.  I have since seen it locally for $4.50.  As good as it was,
   I am unlikely to buy another bottle except as a gift.
Aroma / Appearance - The nose was a vinous combination of caramel,
   cherries, wheat and dark bittersweet chocolate.  The body was a
   semitransparent amber color with a thin layer of clear lacing.
Flavor / Palate - The dense creamy mouthfeel quickly filled every
   corner of my mouth and throat.  It coated my tongue in a mixture of vanilla,
   caramel, chocolate, whole wheat bread and limes.  The alcoholic presence
   comes out eventually but never overwhelms the palate.  This was enjoyable
   and easy to drink, though I cant see finishing more than one in a night.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Pours a slightyly orange-brown amber, with an ample just-off-white head.

Mouthfeel is full, creamy, rich, and thoroughly enjoyable; the alcohol buirn is masterfully hidden so that one tastes a 7% burn while enjoying a beer with a 10% palate.

Strange that I get more of a fig character which was not on the nose throughout the flavor profile. The aftertaste is a bit oxidize and ""barleywine-ish"". Needs to air out and settle for full flavor integration. The feel is sticky and surprisingly sharp, dry and woody on the finish with even some acidic twang.

Maybe Ill hate the way this one tastes. I see that this could be interpreted as a German barleywine and while I do notice some similar qualities such as a high hop level to balance out a lot of sweet malts, I feel like this is closer to a strong Doppelbock in flavor.

Flavor profile is very well balanced throughout, multiple aspects fading and reappearing, including sugary, sweet malts, caramel and light cocoa, licorice, cola, dark grains, baking spices, berryish and raisin fruitiness, faintly herbal hops and doughy yeast attributes coupled with mildly peppery alcohol.  Rather unique and interesting.   The mouthfeel is gently warming and smooth, body is fairly full.

<P> 
Deep chestnut, clear beer; amber-beige firm head. Very malty, bread & molasses, overripe banana, faint brandy nose. Fruity taste, grapes, tons of malt, with a bitterish peak, partly hops (but this is not a hoppy beer like  dat leckere Droppke  is). Again sweetish brandy but the hops/coloured malts take over any time. Flavours of green velvety leaves (vineleaf?) and bready flavours, bread soaked in a sweet brandy with brambles, copper, vinous. Very full bodied, a bit burning MF, very slick. Disconcerting, even the ""usual"" Sticke is very different. Im not sure I really like this - well, I do, but I still chose the draught Alt at the tavern anytime.</P>

Wow, the aroma is concentrated and malty with notes of molasses and dark, sweet cake-like notes.  There is a hint of cocoa powder, and even something resembling cinnamon.  The taste is quite sweet and malty up front, yet it has a spicy hoppiness to it as well.  The finish is dry in a sort of cocoa powder way, but some of the malty, toffee-like sweetness lingers on the palate and tongue even after swallowing this beer.  This beer is quite rich and concentrated, definitely of bock strength.  This almost reminds me of rich, dark German cake or sweetbread that has been lightly spiced.  This beer has that characteristic fresh Alt hoppiness that no Bock would have; herbal with even a hint of citrus fruit.  This is quite nice and flavorful.

No real alcohol flavor despite the 8.5% ABV.  Medium bodied, somewhat sticky with soft natural carbonation.  A little thin on the finish perhaps.  Overall I really liked this.  It really stretches the boundries of an Altbier, much more malty and sweet.

1403,"2005-10-24",4.1,"UPDATED: SEP 18, 2015 The Lure:Luxurious caramel spread onto a rich pie crust. Fruity orange zest is sprinkled on top, as are citrusy, wooden hop pellets. Prune wine is served on the side, and blends perfectly with every bite.

The Festivities:Luscious barley wine maltiness evolves into maple syrup, caramel, and black grape fruitiness. Portentous wooden, citrusy hop flavors continue into appreciable bitterness, and yeast emulates cloves. A smidge of alcohol hits this bitterness, and hints at the beers youth. Clean, flavorful, maybe a little too young to be entirely cohesive, but a superb sipper nonetheless. If doppelsticke is the German answer to American and English barley wines, well let there be more doppelstickes!

Transcendence:Reaching great heights is much better than aspiring to them.

Addendum:A 2½-year-old bottle (bottle in October 2004) proved to have the same luxurious maltiness, plenty of residual sugars, but the hop garden had withered away completely, making it a very sweet barley wine not unlike J.W.Lees Harvest Ale. Quite warming, and alcohol was not a factor at all in the flavor profile, but not as grandiose as the relatively younger version I had had before. 3.8/5","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"

Surely a barleywine level malt intensity, but its a little bit drier than the Bigfoot they cite. Quite a balancing act between the malt and hops: at first I catch the caramelly malt sweetness, then the jumpstart from a hop bill that would have me puckering if they were Aermican hops.

It is enjoyable and pretty much exactly what it is, an amped up version of an already big altbier. The 75 IBUs is certainly more than well contained. The bitterness merges into the alcohol development in mouth. Nutty, oily and salty hints complete the flavor profile. Medium-full bodied, creamy, rather airy structure. A bit syrupy perhaps? And somehow even though the alcohol is well contained, I don’t feel the necessity for a bigger altbier.. it loses any thirst-quenching ability it ever had. A bit like those strong oversweetened pale european lagers in that regard, purposeless as I’d always have another style I’d prefer over this. I’d still consider it a must try.

1403,"2005-07-24",4.0,"This aroma is absolutely killer. Germanic with nostril-hair curling spiciness from hallertau. As someone from the Austrailian continent once said here on RB, flowers and pencils shavings through and through. The malt gets close to unbearably sweet, fatiguing maybe, but still has bandagey plasticyness. Yummy.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
1403,"2005-07-24",3.8,"Bottle.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly lasting.
Body is clear medium to dark brown.

Aroma is moderately malty (toasted bread, nuts, caramel, roasted grain), lightly hoppy (flowers, herbs), trace yeast (dough), with notes of cinnamon, pipe tobacco, cola, wood, sassafrass.

Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, heavily bitter.

Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.

Lotsa bittering hops, as with the other alts from Uerige (so youll want to let this warm up).  Very complex and enticing aroma.  Nice stuff, and my fave from this brewer.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1403,"2005-07-24",3.7,"Murky brown, thin tan head. Woodsy, earthy aroma with notes of cinamon and toffee - Nicely spicy, with hints of cinnamon and maybe some sweet potato? Not sure. Anyhoo, as it warms, notes of toast and honey crop up, plus some pleasent root beer notes. Nice! Thanks to Springslicker for this one!","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
1403,"2005-07-23",3.8,"Nutty malt and caramel mixed with fruity, flowery, piney hops in the aroma.  Looks gorgeous, clear ruby-brown color with a dense off-white head.  Sweet caramel malt with a little fruitiness hits your tongue at first, but then it is balanced by a solid hop bitterness in the back that lingers in the finish.  I wouldnt say it lacks balance, but the sweet and bitter components are almost separate from one another - the flavors lack integration.  Medium body, very easy drinking.  Interesting beer, kind of a cross between a doppelbock (big and sweet) and an alt (bitter with medium body).","Boone, North Carolina, USA","Brodie"
1403,"2005-07-22",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 3, 2005 Tasted this about 2 weeks ago but lost my notes.  I remember it being cloying first of all and the hops were totally un-fitting and overdone, being very sticky, piney and resinous.  The palate was thin and overall, this was just very poorly balanced.  

 

This has turned into a very rich, well balanced German barley wine.  Caramel, toffee and apple flavors, balanced well by the hops.  Not sure what I was thinking with my original ratings","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
1403,"2005-07-20",3.1,"Taster @ PIB.  Smells of malts and noble hops, in other words slightly spicy.  Slightly hoppy taste with hints of raisins, toffee, and slight chocolate.  Full mouth feel, and a sweet body, but not something i would order again.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","porterdude"
1403,"2005-07-13",3.8,"Poured brown with a creamy white head.  Complex aroma of grassy hops with a touch of malt.  Taste is strong sticky caramel up front, with very bitter grassy hops in the end.

1403,"2005-07-13",3.1,"Bottle:  Transparent amber/brown with a large off-white head which is moderately lasting.  Aromas of burnt caramel, and other sweetness.  Flavor is slightly smokey, sweet caramel, quite hoppy, and finishes with a lindering licorice aftertaste.","Berkley, Michigan, USA","Brad"
1403,"2005-07-08",3.4,"The aroma is strong with pineapple and a bit of banana. The deep reddish brown body is topped with an ample rocky peach colored head that sticks pleasingly to the sides of the glass. Lots of caramel and plenty sweet, but not cloying.

1403,"2005-07-08",4.2,"Ooooooga.  Banana notes in yeast, hay, grass, no bitterness in hop aroma but a clean, dry finish with a sweet sticky aftertaste.  Notes of pineapple, cinnamon, good flan (b/c good flan is decadent and bad flan is retch-inducing), apples, caramel, more banana, toastiness and bread in the middle.  This was an English barleywine done right and a German delicacy of complexity and drinkability that most bocks strive for and miss.  Mouthfeel on this side of heavy, smooth with medium, soft carbonation.  Oooo, yummy.","Pennsylvania, USA","Probiere"
1403,"2005-07-03",3.9,"07.03.05  Funny little swingtop bottle as with the other Uerige brews.  This one has been showing up all around NJ lately.  Handsome copper-red pour beneath a creamy head of khaki foam.  Lovely aromas of salted pretzel, pumpernickle bread, brushes with autumn, damp leaves.  Altogether tame and pleasant aromas that do not betray the cyclone hidden beneath the surface.  The flavor that emerges is almost shocking given the mellow tone set on the nose, yet not out of line or off the wall by any means.  Full and round body supports a smooth malty mix of toasty pale grains, very bready, cooling mineral finish, light spicy bite.  Acidic in a way similar to a fresh bread, but not acetic of citric.  Lovely.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"
1403,"2005-07-01",4.4,"Draught @ Papago
This was a special 2-keg extravaganza at Papago, and what a sight and treat it was, but you can read the story on Papago website. The beer fresh from the tap is a dark beauty with a modest creamy light tan head that lingers long, leaving a fine coating of lace upon the glass. Nose is rich in bread dough, sweet and mouth watering this nose, hints of caramel and even a whiff of hops, apples and a bit of alcohol finish it off, start is sweet and thick with malt, the top is middling in its feel. Finish is delectable with its spicy hop bite, the acidity light and the sweet malt dry aftertaste lingers long on the palate, what a treat it was, had several glasses. Personally, I think it could be called a Barley Wine, and I must say it is the best beer I have tasted in quite some time.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
1403,"2005-06-28",3.6,"33 cl bottle from Downtown Liquors in Somerville, MA.  Dark chestnut-amber with huge but fast disappearing white head...sweet whiskeyish, peaty nose, some yeastiness and caramel, fairly strong and heavy...plenty of alcohol in the body as well, excellent thick caramel malt with light smokiness throughout, quite sweet...soft milky mouthfeel, alcohoic harshness fairly prominent near the finish and offering some bitterness amidst the brown sugar and light rosemary/anise character.  More interesting than good, really, but worth a try for the experimentally inclined and alt-lovers.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1403,"2005-06-28",3.1,"Pours a clear, deep amber with a pillow beige head.  Aroma is very doughy and sweet with some alcohol.  Flavor is pretty weak except for an overpowering alcohol burn.  Theres a bit of sweetness in the background.  Finishes bland.  Eh.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","desurfer"

1403,"2005-06-27",3.7,"Poured a dark amber with a slightly yellowish head. The aroma is alcoholic with brandy and some pears. There is also some rich caramel. The taste has some roasted peanuts and a little bit of toffee. There is also a rather dry finish of well toasted bread crust. The alcohol is well hidden. Nicely done. Cool looking bottle.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
1403,"2005-06-26",3.6,"Very nice looking pour. Deep copper topped by a creamy (almost like a forced pour) light tan head. The aroma is light toasted bread, grain and caramel. The flavor is more nutty than the aroma, quite sweet and a surprising hop kick comes late. Medium metallic body. Certainly a stretch for an alt. Very much like a hoppy dopplebock. There is some late astringency that is a bit of a put-off, but otherwise it is pretty enjoyable, and very interesting.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"

1403,"2005-06-22",3.2,"Bottled on 4/18/2005 consumed 6/16/2005.  Copper-amber, with vertical auburn stripes.  Light beige head is initially medium-sized and well-retained, but once I begin to drink and it is disrupted, it departs quickly to a ring.  Decent lacing.  Medium-sized bubbles rise vigorously.  Aroma of light cedar wood pulp, bits of toasted grains, light caramel, but mainly bitterness.  No one else talks about hops, which is odd.  Seems to me to have a lot of hops bitterness, or maybe the bitterness is coming from something else?  Smells like an IPA to me.  Nutty, floral notes, acidic, pine resin.  Acidic and biting, this is powerful stuff.  It lingers on the palate on the finish.  Flavorful, at least, but its so piney.  Sugary and fruity as well, reminds me of DFH 90 minutes.  Low carbonation.  Lightly syrupy body.  No real yeast presence that I can find.  Odd to say the least, IMHO.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1403,"2005-06-21",3.9,"Rich amber color with a thick head. Sticky sweet maple and caramel taste, toast and dried fruits and nuts. Very clean palate, thick, chewy and creamy. Hardly any hop presence but the sweetness isnt over the top. Very rich though.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
1403,"2005-06-20",2.9,"Couleur cuivrée, pleinement translucide.  Belle mousse crémeuse et somptueuse laissant un presque éternel cerceau sur le rebord du verre.  Caramel brûlé, sève de bois, biscuits grillés, marron et noisettes, sous une signature très levurée rappelant la croûte dun pain brun.  En bouche, caramel et poires sont toujours au rendez-vous, mais sont cette fois soumis à la teinture à bois, à une faible présence dacidité et même à une touche dalcool.  Finale étonnamment amère allant presque vers lastringence.  Une forte impression de sel vient bouleverser davantage lexpérience.  Corps semi mince, carbonatation plutôt effacé.  Une étrange et atypique créature en provenance de Düsseldorf.","Quebec, CANADA","OlivierMTL"

It tastes like barleywine, but it does not feel like it has the alcohol of one. Great hop flavor, which also seems strange for a german bier. I love it!","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","SledgeJr"
1403,"2005-06-13",3.9,"Bottle from Chevy Chase Wine & Spirits.  Deep brownish amber, rocky light tan head.  Interesting combination on the nose of caramel, fig, raisin, brown sugar, plum, grape, and light citrus.  Flavor up front was slightly metallic, dried dark fruits and brown sugar, but as it warmed, it was followed up with a citric hop tone that caused me to pause and ponder.    My comments in one second.  Light to medium bodied, medium carbonation, Sahara dry, bittersweet finish.  Back to my thought that this could easily pass for a doppelbock crossed with a barley wine.  As I continued my sipping, it grew on me slowly but surely.  Definitely a unique beer experience and well worth a try...","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"

A bit of earthiness and mushrooms.  Flavour is full of chewy, earthy malts, a bit of woodiness (cedar), slight malty sweetness in the middle of the palate, before an assertive hop bitterness cleanses the palate.  Hops keep this from being cloying.  Fairly full-bodied and a littlle bit of a bready/toasty finish.  Not bad, but not entirely succesful either.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
