Tuoksussa on vähän kaikkea: tynnyröinnin puuta, punaviinimäistä marjaisuutta, tummaa hedelmää, kuivattua hedelmää, banaaniakin sekä lievää paahdetta. Lievä mausteisuus ja pähkinäisyys seuraa tuoksussa koko ajan mukana. Huumaava tuoksu, monimuotoinen ja syvä. Maku jatkaa monimuotoista linjaa: vahvaa luumua ja kuivattua hedelmää,keskimaussa hieman anismainen mausteisuus työntyy esiin, punaviinimäistä tanniinista tuhtiutta, tynnyröinnistä tulevaa puuta, lopussa häivähdys paahteisuutta ja koko makupalettia täydentää lievä lakritsinen sekä pähkinäinen vivahde. Suutuntuma on lämmittävän alkoholinen ja melko täyteläinen, lopussa alkoholi polttaa ehkä hieman liikaa, muuten olisi täysi vitonen. Täyteläinen, monimuotoinen, tuhti ja todellinen klassikko. Vaikka aromeja sekä tuoksussa että maussa on paljon, ne täydentävät loistavasti toisiaan nostaen oluen entistä korkeammalle. Täydellinen valinta 1000. arvioksi ja top 10-kamaa itselleni ehdottomasti.

Comments: Compares to the original Struise Pannepot, this one has the nice cidery oak barrel aroma and subtle, very well-presented rum and barrel taste, at the expense of rich maltyness and dark fruity characters.

2307,"2016-07-15",3.5,"Ekstrakt:  24% wag. 
 IBU:  27 
 Data butelkowania:  15.03.2016 
 Kolor:  Ciemny brąz. Słaba przejrzystość. 
 Piana:  Dokładnie taka jakiej się spodziewałem. Aparat nawet nie zdążył ustawić ostrości kiedy piana zniknęła do zera. Potrwało to może z 5 sec. 
Po chwili zniknęła także milimetrowa otoczka. Nie jestem nawet w stanie określić ani jej kolory, ani grubości.
Krążkowania (jak można się domyślić) również brak. 
 Zapach:  Aromat nie jest zbyt intensywny. Określiłbym go jako umiarkowany.
Na początek ciemne owoce: figi, daktyle, ciemne winogrona. W kontrze do nich przypalony karmel, cukier trzcinowy i odrobina toffi.
Po zamieszaniu buteleczki uaktywnia się czekoladowa słodycz i lekka alkoholowa moc. 
 Smak:  W smaku zdecydownie owocowe - figi, daktyle, suszone śliwki, morele, następnie ciemne winogrona.
Podobnie jak w aromacie czuć karmel, toffi i delikatną czekoladę.
Chwilami przewija się mocna nuta ciężkiego czerwonego wina w stylu Porto.
Goryczka niska, krótka. Alkohol nie jest ani rozpuszczalnikowy, ani drapiący. Można jedynie zarzucić mu rozgrzewającą siłę.
Grand Reserva ma gęstą, oleistą fakturę. 
Piwo ma pełne ciało, jest cholernie treściwe i chwilami nawet zbyt ciężkie. Sącze już chyba z godzinę tą buteleczkę i nie mogę jej skończyć.
Mocarny trunek, ale do Pannepot Reserva się nie umywa! 
 Wysycenie:  Szampańskie wręcz. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Piwo zakupiłem będąc pod ogromnym wrażenie wcześniej degustowanego Pannepot Reserva.
Niestety muszę przyznać, że zawiodłem się srodze.

Piwo nie ma żadnego startu do swojego poprzednika.
Przede wszystkim zupełnie brakuje mi tutaj akcentów beczki! Tamto piwo pachniało potężnie wanilią i mokrym drewnem. Tutaj zupełnie tego nie odnajduje.
Są natomiast akcenty ciemnych owoców (daktyle, śliwki, ciemne winogrona, figi) kontrowane czekoladową słodyczą.

W zasadzie mogłem się tego spodziewać. Dopiero przed rozpoczęciem degustacji, kiedy robiłem fotki spojrzałem na datę. Piwo jest zbyt świeże. Ma zaledwie 3 miesiące i łatwo było przewidzieć, że nie będzie jeszcze odpowiednio odleżakowane.

Coż mogę więcej powiedzieć - mocarny trunek, wybitnie degustacyjny, do powolnego sączenia.
Jestem pewien, że znajdzie (po odpowiednim odleżakowaniu) masę fanów.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

2307,"2015-09-09",4.1,"Bottle from West Lakeview Liquors (Chicago, IL). 2010 Vintage. Pours a deep brownish ruby hue, mahogany purple ruby glow hits the body. A firmer haziness, dark middle with just a hint of rubyfire on the edges striking nicely. Frothy tannish head atop is decent sized, a nice layer sticks around but dies quicker, mellow ringer atop is smaller, concise with solid lacing atop. Aromas are lovely and deep, darker candi sugars, biscuit and touches of caramel meet some mellow spiciness, yeasty life and jabs of allspice, black cherry and dried fruit. Some oaky presence, depth with tannic vanillin. Candy sugars, gentle estery fruit as more cherryskin, some oak and spirit life through that depth and deeper sweetness. A bit of cakey sweetness, chocolatey and vanilla and mellow cherry, faint anise and spiciness still hanging on. Initial is medium bodied, a bit more full with some tannic woody depth, gentle caramel and brown sugar, touches of plum and dried fruit, black cherry and spiciness. A mellow yeasty life, allspice and anise, almost a cool spiciness really with that yeasty zest. Caramel, a bit of fudgey chocolate and earthiness, tannic oak and a bit of yeastiness. Toasty, cocoa jabs and a coolness as we round the corner. Its amazing how light on the palate this ends up, complex and deeper flavors with a nice tannic element throughout without overbearing or ending up brooding. A bit of cola, cherries, dark and a bit pulpy with some some nice depth. This ends up tantalizingly drinkable despite its hefty ABV tag. A bit of stickiness lingers, darker and a bit toasty, tannic with some faint residual sugars and barrel lingering nicely, subtle spice, carmelized malts and some dark fruit and cocoa. Really nice damn stuff. Well done. Totally see why this is a classic.

2307,"2015-08-15",4.2,"330mL bottle from Beer Cartel. Vintage 2010
Sort of surprised I overlooked this beer - always figured there was just 1 Pannepot, and that was it.
Deep, nearly opaque bronze beer, holds a creamy tan head.
Decadent, almost fortified wine-like nose to it- burnt toffee, earthy dark candy sugar, licorice, lots of raisins, date, dried figs, sultanas, prunes, yet still plums and blackcurrant esters in there too, savoury clovey spices, black pepper and nutmeg, and old oak. 
Carbonation is quite high, smooth, slighlty velvety, rich body yet doesnt give away too much of that substantial abv, just a flirting of warmth.
Richly complex palate - dark brown sugar, bruised apple, sultana, freshly ground nutmeg, burnt fig, nutty old port-like rancio, dried leafy herbs (almost like bay or sage or something). Bitterness relatively high for style, really long drawn out finish.
This is the sort of ale youve gotta take your time, hide away in a dark corner and just thoroughly enjoy every drop of. Sitting in front of a roaring place seems apt enough for this tasting. Needless to say, this is just fantastic!","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

Medium+ bodied, with soft but appropriate carbonation, the taste incorporated a majority of the aroma notes, continued the melanoidin-like sweetness, offered a bit of tartness, moderate earthy & tannic astringency, and alcohol that was port-like and warming.

Pours an almost black, dark brown color with ruby red undertones, and a spongy, light brown head.

Offers aromas of wood, coconut, toasty malts and earth. On top of that foundation settles peppery clove, sugared lemon peel and cardamon, coated up by melted toffee and a whiff of rock sugar. Reveals way less sweetness than the regular version, together with warm, old oak.

Has a lower carbonation with an utmost smooth mouthfeel, complimenting the rich oak flavours.

Tastes of wood bark, moldy earth, forest honey and toffee. The beer then gets topped of by melted caramel, slightly burning spices and sweet rock sugar. Offers a gentle alcoholic warmth, blending directly into the well pronounced spices. Ends with rich caramel and more, slightly burning spices on top of the balancing wooden earth.

Its low carbonation opens the palate up to many subtle flavors, topped off by the typical, spicy Pannepot sweetness, gently balanced by wood and earth, which is an aspect I do miss, regarding the beers regular version. Its wooden aspect compliments the spices, while revealing a pleasant warmth, with oak, which doesnt turn too present on its own. Its finish turns out to be a bit flat unless the barrel turns up, providing a neccesary earthiness, making the beers appearance complete.","GERMANY","aleigator"

2307,"2015-04-26",4.5,"2009 bottle. Thanks ShroudofDoom! 
This was poured into a chalice. 
The appearance was a dark ruddy brown color with a slim white head that dissipated to a soft glaze of lacing. It slid nicely. 
The smell had a soft sweet dark fruit with a light sweet cherry, a little bit of coffee and a light chocolate shaping the aroma nicely.
The taste was mainly sweet through the previously mentioned flavors and gave an extremely sticky dark fruity aftertaste leading to a sweet wet fruity finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a decent sessionable quality about it. The carbonation was barely there but thats okay considering this was a 2009 bottle. Sweet smooth sticky notes cling nicely to the feel of the beer over my tongue.

Aroma is moderately sweet with mostly dark caramel and toffee. Hints of chocolate and roast and even lighter notes of tobacco. Medium light raisin, fig and prune esters with a light clove and coriander phenolic note. A light brandy character with a hint of oak and sherry. 
Pours a dark brown with a bit of a burnt amber hue. A moderately sized, fairly thick, dark tan head with good retention as it recedes to a thin head that lingers thicker on the edges. Medium light lacing and moderate legs. 
Flavor is moderately sweet and a but sweeter in the finish. Lots of caramel, toffee, and burnt sugar notes. Lighter chocolate and treacle with faint roast and faint we tobacco.

2307,"2015-04-14",4.1,"2008 draught at Mead Hall, 4/9/15.Deep cocoa powder brown beer shows a high clarity and plentiful burgundy/auburn highlights on the edges. Beige head is medium-sized and recedes slowly to cover.Soft, understated wood tannins combine with very light caramel and toffee malt notes while fruitiness, either from the yeast or the calvados helps brighten things somewhat. Most of the things youd expect from wood-aging are present; vanilla, oak, mild astringency. However, theres absolutely no harshnss, even upon warming, nor any fusels or heavy ethanol. Notes of dark berries, light tobacco, cocoa powder and black pepper all lurk behind the delightful yeast that makes this beer so endearing. Didnt bother reading the description before drinking and was not aware this was calvados-aged. Its subtle and I would not have guessed calvados, though its obviously not bourbon.Much like the aroma, the flavor is ""mild"" for its size, with chewy, dry toffee-like malt notes providing a delicious base for the wood tannin and esters to play about on. Ample carbonation still, though not overdone, lending to more drinkability. Vanilla, apples, currants, blueberries and very light brown sugar notes. Alcohol provides some warmth, which seems inevitable at this level, but is never raw/grainy/harsh. Ive had issues with calvados barrel-aged beers being very sharp/harsh (see fresh DDB Dulle Teve Reserva) but with this one I couldnt even tell it was calvados.  I think the 7 years have certainly done this well, by the looks of the fresher ratings.  Apple character has faded quite a bit.  Lots to love here; the texture, the relative mildness and the cohesion of all the flavors (and the delightful yeast, of course). Not too much to find fault here and like the regular version, just a stupendous beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Look: Pours with large mocha head, moderate thickness. Very nice, slow retention, leaves a fine, consistent layer, like pancake dough, fair amount of lacing when going down. Darker brown, amber hue (not as dark as stouts).


Smell: Plums! Like plum wine, sherry and lots of sweet dark and dry fruits, from grapes to berries. The medium sweet malt character is made from caramel, milky chocolate and very lovely subtle roast , very suiting and interesting. Also oak and vanilla. 


Taste: Plums are still the most dominating dry fruits, but there are others too. Taste then goes to medium sweet caramel, milky chocolate, candy middle. It is accompanied with light acidity and oak. It finishes with light bitterness, very smooth roast coffee and ends with chocolate lingering in the after. Very small spike of boozy oak at the end with spicy complexity. The spicy complexity is more subtle than in the non-aged ones. 


Mouthfeel: Full, medium heavy body, very creamy, alcohol well incorporated.


Overall: Its a masterpiece, the oak is a subtle gain to the winning formula, but I do miss a bit of the spicy mash-up from the base version of this beer. Overall a bit tuned down but still superb. Every sip is better and different.","SLOVENIA","tmzl"

2307,"2014-03-12",4.1,"Pours a rich deep brown with a thinner than expected tan head. The body of this beer is beautiful though. Aroma hits you as soon as you start pouring it into the glass. Pull it closer to your nose and it fills your nostrils with hints of cherry, brown sugar, oak, whiskey, and dried dark fruits. Very complex aroma, very appetizing. Flavor is bold, but not as bold as the aroma lets on. Dark fruits, wood, molasses, cigar smoke, and charcoal flavors are all intertwined in this delicious beer. Also, at 10% abv, the alcohol is expertly hidden in this one. Not nearly as boozy as youd expect. The beer is smooth on the palate and is carbonated perfectly. Not quite as full bodied as Id like but thats nitpicking at this point. Overall this is one of the better beers that Ive had in awhile and will probably break into my top 5 ""Belgian style"" ales.

Moderate bitterness, moderate sweetness, light alcohol. Very good, but sadly overall weaker than the 2006 regular, which managed to impress with a sofisticated complexity.

2307,"2013-10-04",4.1,"Bottle at Brasserie V. Unfiltered thick, viscous brown-burgundy. Oily thin residue of a head, but hey, its almost seven years old. Semi-boozy Calvados aroma, some sweet oaky caramel too. The Calvados barrels really shine, sort of overwhelming at first. Big and a lot of sweet depth. Rather balanced and subdued after a few sips, in a Belgian way. Broad range of barrel tones begin to show, with big, sweet oak and an almost Grand Marnier-like quality of the Calvados. A real quality, memorable beverage. Mellows and the oaky caramel really starts to come out. Maybe one of the better barrel aged Belgians Ive ever had, sort of connecting the old school Belgian quality with new school innovation.

2307,"2013-01-16",4.2,"2005 Bottle
100th Belgian Strong Rate! First rate of 2013! 

Pours a very dark brown, with ruby hues when held up to the light. The head is big and tan and fluffy, leaving a nice lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is rich but earthy, strange and intriguing. Its largely fairly subtle, more so than a dark strong Belgian beer usually is. But its very enjoyable, nice pear and dark cherry fruit notes. Toasted nuts & a well finessed woodiness.

The flavor is very woody, but in a well rounded way, not brash or overbearing at all. The roastiness is mild and with the help of some light alcohol this makes for a bold and warming beer. The nuttiness and spiciness show up more mid palate and follow through the finish. As it warms the beer becomes sweeter and has more dark fruit & vanilla. Nothing is overbearing, nothing is out of place, I can say this seems to have aged very well... but Ive never had a fresh example as comparison. I will say that this has basically no apparent oxidation issues or any other ""old"" character. In fact Im a little surprised that its a 7 year old beer.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

2307,"2013-01-06",4.8,"2006 bottle. Huge (huge!) thanks to Matt for finding, splurging on, and hauling this back from Amsterdam. Pours a murky very dark brown, with a good amount of sediment. Aroma is like chocolate-covered dark fruits, with brown sugar and a bit of baking spices. The calvados is a wonderful counter, providing just a hint of an apple zing, but it isnt strong after 6 years. Just enough to team with the alcohol and provide a wonderful balance to what would have been a very sweet beer. It has an extremely pungent aroma, a silky smooth mouthfeel, and a stunningly balanced flavor, which also includes some mild leather and . Every sip leaves you wanting more.

Aroma is full of sweet candi syrup and almost no barrel notes (I would have thought it would be a barrel bomb but it isnt...). Mouthfeel is watery compared to the regular Pannepot and carbonation is low-medium which is nice. Taste is sweet with a sour edge. Flavors of molasse and again close to none Calvados notes. The sourness must come from the barrel though and maybe Calvados just doesnt blend well with this kind of brew. It is good and enjoyable, just not meeting my somewhat high expectations for a barrel aged Pannepot. Might be because it was bottled in 2007 too.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

This beer appears a dark brown color. There is an off white / tan head that fades to about 1/4 inch and holds. Spotty lacing encompasses the circumference of the tulip glass. The aroma is of an authentic Belgian quad: yeasty, bready, enticing. The taste is incredibly smooth and delicious. Five years of age on a well crafted quad does some wonderful things.

2005 bottle. Dark almost opaque brown with a dark brown diminishing fizzy head and lace.  Aroma starts simple bread and yeast then goes sweet boozy raisins and figs, spice and herb notes.  Flavor is moderately sweet raisin bread with a little tang early, later moderate bitterness  with wood and chalk taking over. Silken soft gives way to a dry tannin end.  I dont get much Calvados but the booze is easy enough.  Seriously complex, rich and deep beer that draws you in at each raise of the glass.  A special occasion in itself but worthy of a celebration.

Revised notes from 1/1/13.  At 7 years its still drinking wonderfully but next to the 2009 Reserva their is noticeable dead yeast component that may be a sign it is past its prime. Its considerably more rich though more mellowed and oxidized.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","bmerz"
2307,"2012-07-09",4.2,"Bottle. Moderate to heavy toasted and dark bread for the malt, light herbs for the hops, moderate earth and dough for the yeast, with notes of raisin, dark rum, fruitcake and faint tobacco. Head is small, fizzy, tan with a few spots of lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is very dark brown. Flavor starts lightly to moderately sweet and moderately acidic, then finishes lightly to moderately sweet and lightly acidic and bitter. Palate is medium to full, a little slick with a soft carbonation and a moderately alcoholic finish. A tasty Belgian Strong Ale in perfect balance. Mostly like the other Pannepots with just a slight difference.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"
2307,"2012-07-08",4.0,"2005 vintage. Pours opaque, tan head. Aroma of dark fruit and some toffee/cocoa, but more reserved than the 2007 Pannepeut consumed just prior. Carbonation is outrageously soft and supple. Some dark fruit on the palate, but the oak flavor seems to be muting the fruit and adding some, well oaky and woody/alcoholic notes. Im not really getting much of any calvados, maybe a hint of brandy on the finish, maybe. A great beer, but in truth the oak isnt really necessary and takes away from the beers overall flavor.","Decatur, Georgia, USA","jwr07"
2307,"2012-07-05",4.2,"Big thanks to Hog Town Harry for this 2005 vintage. This beer is like nothing Ive ever had before. Pours with a creamy head, slightly viscous lacing. The smell reveals slightly soured cherries, raisins, alcohol and apricot. The sourness builds a wall around my mouth on sipping, a slight, thin, pleasant tartness that gives this beer a real individual character. Wasnt what I was expecting, and its damn good for it. Sourness hangs around for a good long palate with a surprise of light anise at the end.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
2307,"2012-07-02",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 3, 2017 Grand Reserva 2008. 33cl bottle. - Quite a full and tasty step or 2 up from the regular Reserva due to its fuller, creamier mouthfeel (while retaining the unusual but typical heavy Belgian carbonation) and reduced sugar content, giving way to a very rich, seamy and drinkable dark chocolate quality, which makes this a great dessert (no real dessert needed to go with it). Normally not a big fan of the spicy and sirupy Belgian dark ales, but this is redeeming its pedigree.

2307,"2012-06-09",4.2,"Pours a dark maroon red, slighty cloudy, with a fizzy head that disappears quickly. Seems darker and cloudier than its younger sibling.

The aroma is incredibly powerful. Gobs of cherries and woodsy vanilla. A smoky and dense theme is apparent. Almost has a port-like quality. More mature than the regular Pannepot. More umami-esque. Some subtle mushroom flavors. Just slightest hint of funk, leathery, maybe even a little cheesy. Seems deeper, more complex. As it warms, armagnac-soaked prunes appear.

I take a sip. Wow. Big. Its still a bit cold but the beer goes through several stages on the palate. This beer is a boxer landing a big blow right off the bat. Smoky, deep, rich. Cherries still appear, but the fruit recedes behind a layer of tobacco, alcohol and oak. The sweetness is present but has mellowed out. Tannins are present on the mid-palate. And then, pow! Another hit of vanilla and coffee rings across my tongue. Alcohol is more apparent as the sip goes down. A long aftertaste coats the palate and lasts forever. Beautiful tobacco and caramel flavor develop slowly.

This beer is mysterious. A little more complex than the regular Pannepot, more pungent but less in control of itself, especially as it ends. The nose is spectacular though, and it is a remarkable brew overall. Cant thank Urbain and Carlo enough!","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

More of the rich dark fruits with raisins and plums as well as some brandy. Fruits get a bit vinous towards the end as a light oak and spicing comes in as this finishes with a peppery dark fruit, sweet malts, light oak, and a slight alcohol kick that helps dry this a bit with the oak and spice before leaving a fairly lengthy aftertaste. Creamy, pretty full body and a slightly lively, soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty complex and fairly delicate beer for the high ABV%.

En première bouche, on trouve de la crème de noix, de la mûre, du blé 
noir, avec une pointe de café noir, de cassis et de chocolat noir.
La seconde bouche est concentrée sur le café, mais avec un équilibre
global très agréable, et où on perçoit bien le travail de mûrissement
exceptionnel (14 mois en french oak et 8 mois de finish sur du calvados wood ) Excusez du peu .... Il est vrai que la production est limitée à 30
hectolitres tous les 2 ans. Pas de quoi satisfaire tous les fans !!!
La finale est superbe, comme un gâteau bavarois au café et au chocolat
noir, avec toujours un très bel équilibre, où lalcool ne domine pas du
tout, mais plutôt lensemble des arômes.
On ne peut coter ce type de bière, qui vous donne tout et encore plus,

3.5 A: Pours a ruddy brown color. Barely half a fingers of frothy light brown head. Retention isnt all that great either, but the ABV is up there. No lacing.

4.0 S: Strong green apple presence alongside candied plum, fig, and date. Vanilla with some oak, caramel, toasted malts, and a light nuttiness. Peppery spiciness. Its very nice, but everything about it is subtle.

4.0 T: Taste is like the nose for the most part. Candied dark fruits, green and red apple, vanilla and oak. Caramel, toasted malt, nuts. Pepper fromt the yeast. Heres the thing about this though. Theres an almost ""biting"" woody aspect in here. Its not present in the normal Pannepot, so I assume its from the Calvados. Its not a bad flavor, but it is a dominant one that doesnt fit in with the rest of the beer. Either way, still tasty.

3.5 M: Lighter medium body. This could use a bit more carbonation and it would be better if it were spritzier. Could use a touch more creaminess too.

4.0 D: Good beer, but I cant say that I think all the extra stuff has made the regular any better.

Me favorite treatment of Pannepot- though the spiciness is a bit muted,  I love how the Calvados treatment shines through, adding a bit of sweet tartness.

1. This is my first review here
2. My poor English.

Tasted in the end of 2010: almost black. Discreet, harmonious nose - lots of malt, a bit of citrus,  notes of cedarwood. On the palate theres a great interplay between malt and citrus notes. Rich in content and kind of refreshing - both at the same time! I love this slightly sour notes. Not too many roasted flavours; small notes of wood and vanilla. Great complexity. Absolutely adorable beer. Very long finish with a fine sweet/sour/bitter balance. Close to perfection. One of those beers, that show more on the palate that on the nose. One of the best beers till now - even better then Pannepot and Pannepot Reserva.   Ende 2010 getrunken: beinahe schwarz. Verhaltene, harmonische Nase - viel Malz, etwas Zitrus, Zedernholznoten. Am Gaumen ein tolles Wechselspiel zwischen dem Malz und den Zitrusnoten. Gehaltvoll und beinah erfrischend gleichzeitig. Ich liebe diese säuerlichen Noten! Nicht sonderlich viele Röstaromen; leichte Holz- und Vanillearomen. Sehr komplex! Absolut großartiges Bier. Sehr langes Finale mit einer wunderbaren Süß/Sauer/Bitter-Balance. Ganz nah an der Perfektion. Eines dieser (seltenen) Biere, die am Gaumen mehr preisgeben, als an der Nase. Für mich bislang eines der besten Biere, die ich getrunken habe - auch besser als das ""normale"" Pannepot und das Reserva.","GERMANY","beerism"
2307,"2012-01-24",3.8,"Not bad but regular Pannepot is far better.  This kind of just lost flavor/carbonation from the original and left a much flatter spicy watered down version of the original, which still tastes good but compared to the original falls flat.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"

There is a thin-moderate creamy light brown head that lingers until mid-glass and leaves partial lace.  Very pleasant aroma of oak, malt, vanilla, dates, figs and just a bit of molasses.  The flavor is malt and oak with malty sweetness along with some dates and figs.  The flavor of the scotch emerges towards the finish and is somewhat boozey.  Mild bitterness at the finish.

2307,"2011-12-28",4.2,"Oh yum, long time want, finally getting around to drink more of Urbains beers. This was a great treat, 2005 vintage. Did I say yum?

Beer is black / brown with haze at the corners of the glass. Forms a good head of small off white bubbles that leaves some lacing on the glass but the head doesnt stay around much.

Aroma is sweet and bready with good esters of fruits and some spice as well. Its decent volume, a great aroma.

So, my biggest criticism of this beer is that I cant taste the oak, it says on the bottle that its oak aged but there is no real vanilla or tannic character, it is however good tasting. Its sweet, malty, no alcohol really, mildly spicy in the midpalate, some plums and mild raisins. Very good.

2307,"2011-12-08",4.6,"Vintage 2005.  The pour is a deep, dark red color, nearly black with a fairly small, frothy, tan head which settles to a very thin froth throughout and leaves similar lace. The nose is like a fruit explosion; blueberry, plum skins, figs, dark chocolate cake, light cinnamon, vanilla custard, some toasted caramel, and faint notes of pecan.  The flavor is immaculate, balancing malt richness and depth melding with balance; still rich chocolate cake, light fudge, plum skins and blueberry, toasted caramel and pecan, faint vanilla in there, before a nice floral and coffee bitterness balances with some toasted oak rounding the flavor.  The palate is nice with a full body, nearly lively carbonation, and a round, velvety mouthfeel.  The beer finishes in a long progression with rich cake and fudge slowly giving way to the toasted oak, coffee bitterness, and still blueberry lingering throughout.  This one just took a great beer and made it much better; age and oak rounds out the flavors, the complexity only grows more, and the richness is still there with a perfect balance.  I could drink this all night even for a rich and complex beer.  Not sure how this one could be any better, seriously.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

2307,"2011-11-16",3.6,"Bottle thanks to Cam from IBS. A very big thank you for my 800th rating. Pours cloudy brown-amber with a very small ring of beige bubbles forming a head. Head quickly disappears and leaves some decent spider legs down the glass. Nose is plummy with the addition of raisins and spices. Slight caramel with a very obvious note of calvados. Calvados masks a lot of the other notes a little too much. Lots of plum and oak in the taste. Slight spices. Again there is a large calvados note right through. Alcohol is warming but never too much. A very nice beer indeed but I find the calvados to be a little overwhelming. Comes together quite nicely though and is fairly balanced.

It pours a slightly reddish brown with not too much head.

You wouldnt have to tell me this was aged in Calvados barrels. It is full on with the calvados scent. I think it kind of detracts form this brew which is one of the best of all time. There is also a lot of basic dark fruit. Some of the original qualities of the beer have been masked. It still smells pretty good though.

2307,"2011-09-23",3.6,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2013 Side by side rating of 2005 and 2008 vintage: From the bottle the 2008 vintage displays a more malty aroma than the 2005, which seems to have a more acidic or vinous nose. When poured the 2008 vintage has more of the tan head than the 2005 vintage. Both have a transparent copper body. Even if the head diminishes rather quickly on both, the 2008 vintage seems to retain a bit more film than the 2005, which is practically headless after a few seconds. There is no head regeneration ability on the 2005 vintage, where the 2008 vintage is slightly more accomodating in that regard. Aromawise the 2005 vintage is dominated by caramel and oxydisation, where the 2008 vintage has a more interesting and complex aroma of malts with notes of licorice, rye bread, biscuits and caramel. The 2005 vintage is flat, has a medium body, oily texture and a tart, cidery finish. The 2008 vintage has much of the same but it seems to have a stronger body and also more of the oak and calvados presence that blends in nicely with the malt. Tastewise both tend to follow the nose. Theres no doubt in my mind that the 2008 vintage is by far the more pleasant one by now. Ratings given are for the 2008 vintage.

2307,"2011-04-07",4.3,"Back to the Belgians...

First off, let me say that my reviews get tempered by effort.  When we first started drinking Belgians, all we had  available was Chimay. Not a bad thing, but it made it hard to really compare beers and set up this crazy fake economy.

Now theres this and that and oh my god THIS and you have to try THAT...

(theres a lot of hype) 


I tried so mnay Belgians that I was getting sick of the style. I had to chase down Westvleteren 12 because that was ""IT"". And then this, and then that... 

I  came to rest a few years ago on Rochefort 10. Without a doubt, the most exotic - yet full-on perfect Quad in the abbey style that you can purchase in America readily. What a bonus that you can get it in a Columbus general store for $5.99 a bottle. I can roll out to Market District in PA and get it easily. Should that decrease its spiritual validity? No. But somehow, people rate it lower because you dont have to pay a smuggler to bring it in to the states. And because their abbey has not closed down sales to infidels like Westvleteren. 

I had Westy for the first time last year. Its great. Dont get me wrong. World class. BUT. Its like selling your bone marrow to get one here. 

Rochefort 10 is at least as good AND you can actually get it! I think ""effort"" needs to be a criteria attribute for rating beer. as in ""Is it worth the damn effort"" But I digress. At many BAers insisting - I sought out Pannepot. It took a LOT of effort to get one. But less effort than a Westy 12. But considerably more effort than a Rochefort 10. 

Pours like a Belgian. Looks like a Belgian. Done.

Taste is somewhere between R10 and W 12. Thats an oversimplification. Its flat-out wonderful. But is it waaay more wonderful than R10? Not really. Is it soooo different from R10? Not really.

If you havent had it - yes you have to try it. But dont break the bank to do so.

Like Rochefort 10, but a little less cloying. 
In a perfect world- if all 3 of these were available at my local bottle store for the same price - I would still buy R10.

But thats me.","Pennsylvania, USA","radioscooter"

2307,"2011-03-27",4.5,"I drank this 2005 version from a 11.2 oz bottle into my Rochefort glass.

It pours dark brown, much darker than the regular pannepot. There is hardly any carbonation, only about a quarter of an inch rises and is gone right away. Good to great lacing. 

The aroma is medium and complex. There is lots of dark fruits on the front prunes and figs, some yeast in the middle, and light subtle oaky finish. Really balanced, and allows you smell something different each whiff. 

The taste is simply outstanding, wonderfully flavor and complex. It starts off with a great balance of sweet prunes, yeast and inverted sugar like a great trappist blonde. Then all of a sudden you get this super smooth oaky finish that is surprising and great. A superb twist on a quad. 

The feel is medium bodied, and very smooth, coates the mouth and finishes slick as glass. Not much of lasting taste.

The drinkability is great, very surprised this is 10%.

Overall, I didnt have great expectations because although I like pannepot I dont think its on par with trappists. However, after drinking this it clearly is deserved in such praise. Great beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

Le nez est très agréable, je dirais même presque fantastique avec des effluves liquoreuses de pommes et de fruits enfûtés, des parfums vineux, touché par un caramel chaud, frôlé par la vanille et exposer à des vapeurs douces de bonbons belges.  Les saveurs mapparaissent un peu moins intéressantes, légèrement décalées par rapport aux arômes, mais tout de même avenantes : les flaveurs révèlent les tannins du chêne, les pommes et les fruits ont des caractéristiques surettes, légèrement fermentées.  Le caramel est présent mais peu intense.  Des pointes de réglisse se dessinent et flattent les papilles.  En bouche, le liquide est plutôt en manque de corps.

I wish Id had the opportunity to taste this earlier, as I can imagine the Calvados in particular accentuating some of the intense flavors.

The flavor is a little too vinegary for me.  Definitely more so than regular Pannepot and Reserva and its a bit of a turn off.  Lots of rotted wood in here with ripe apples, licorice, sweet dark fruit, funky yeast, and a little metallic taste.  The palate is considerably thinner than expected.  Probably due to the extra time in oak as well as age of the bottle but this lacks the rich qualities I was expecting.

Taste is extremely silky, with nutty flavors coming in first, only to be replaced slowly by port wine, brandy, caramel and hints of toffee. Excellent blended; this is a brew merged to a seamless mix of flavors over the years.

T - Starts with strong dark fruit and licorice along with some Calvados flavor. Some dark roasted malt with burnt molasses and caramel provide a background base.

Notes: Vintage 2005. Pretty good beer, but Im not entirely sure if the aging in the Calvados really made an improvement to either the normal Pannepot or the Reserva as it detracts a bit from the enjoyable flavors in those two. It does add a little something different though.

2307,"2010-05-01",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 22, 2011 This is a revision of my original rating from 2010-04-30, when JB and TB finished med school. Now revisiting a year later as I finish. 33 cL bottle from the Kensington Wine Market in Calgary, served in a Trappist glass. Pours hazy mahogany with a tiny tan head. The head quickly fades to a thin remnant, leaving behind trace lace. The aroma has plenty of raisins, toasted malts and candi sugar, along with molasses, chocolate, dark fruit and oak. The flavour is moderately malty sweet with a touch of sourness. The flavour has a huge oaky accent. There is also a good dose of candi sugar up front and a delicate spice that grows towards the finish. The finish is a beautiful mix of raisins and spice that lingers for a long while. On the palate, it is full in body with a smooth, creamy texture and minimal carbonation. Overall, this is an excellent ale with a beautiful oaky, spicy character. It is incredibly subtle and grows in complexity the longer it is savoured. Among the very best ales out there. 2011-04-16","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"

The flavor is again quite malty, caramel, overripe fruit, gentle dry roasted finish. Very complex. Perfectly balanced. The body is full, smooth and sticky.

2307,"2010-02-05",4.5,"No idea what this beer was about until I took my first smell and started drooling heavily... that never happens. Bought this in October 2008...  kinda forgot about it! Poured out a very very dark brown brew with red hues, ok sized medium tan head but it sure looks good once it boils down to a thick skim with a clinging rim and cascading lacing. The aroma is amazing - sourness with cherries, sweet apple, more sourness, oak, raisin, fig, more sour cherry/ raspberry that is making me drool hard, anise and the resemblance to a dry, young fruity red wine is unmistakable. The taste is quite sour with obvious notes of the oak, slight but early leather, very sour cherry or even beyond - maybe even just plain old sourness, sweetness can be found under that, qualities of a red wine that has sat for too long on the shelf, bretts, stiff, harsh apple, burnt sugar, weak coffee, caramel and now, near the end the first hint of alcohol burn, a touch of cheap scotch, some lingering spice that was probably there the entire time but Im down to the last 2 sips ( so soon??? booo). Full bodied, creeps up to viscous while keeping thin enough not to ruin things, finishes soft with sourness, random malts (ha!) and other things that Ive gave up on. This beer was very very awesome. I did leave the sediment behind on this specific bottle which is a bit odd considering  my dedication to swirl everything in at one point or another.** Just drank the swirled up yeast / sediment shot - fucking excellent!","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Aromas of dark caramel, apple orchard, soft oxidation, and a bit of alcohol. Flavor conveys nervy bright top notes, oddly but not unpleasantly, on the attack and is quickly followed by a tightly coiled malt profile with lots of caramel, spice, great oxidation, and a touch of fruity sweetness in the background. The body is deceptively light and quite vibrant given the overall heft of the beer.

2307,"2010-01-06",4.9,"UPDATED: JAN 11, 2010 My first rating in 2010 and I thought Id start it off right with what in my opinion is the best beer in the world! Ive had both the 05 and the 06 vintages, but this rating is the 2005.  I poured with a heavy hand into my snifter glass, but this brew seemed unwilling to give me much carbonation. I end up with a half inch tan head covering a dark brown, almost black body. The head fades moderately fast, but leaves some nice, light lacing on the glass. The nose is vinous and deep fruits like plums, dark chocolate and hints of coffee with some toffee sweetness as well as wood notes with hints of spices; as it warms, there is some banana and the sweetness becomes more pronounced. Leads with deep fruit in the mouth, following into chocolate, molasses, hints of coffee, spices like cinnamon and cloves with more deep fruits and even some banana. Finish is lingering fruit and bittersweet chocolate. The barrel aging is more noticeable in the mouth. Mouthfeel is beautifully smooth with warming alcohol on the finish. I had the 2006 vintage back in the fall, and the only real difference in my rating was that I noted some light hops at that time, but thats understandable with beer that is a year younger... I have on several ocassions declared this to be the best beer in the world, and this latest tasting only confirms that! In fact, I even had brewer Carlo autograph a bottle of the 05 for me on my visit to Struises Old School.... Beautiful beer.","Heerlen, NETHERLANDS","jnelson_22"

The taste is like WAAW: I dont think I already drunk a more complex and good beer as this one.

2307,"2009-12-17",3.8,"The hazy burgundy brown liquid keeps it elegant beige cover forever. Wood and fruit cake are evoked in this spicy-anise, oregano, pepper- aroma. The wood quickly takes a strong apple character, revealing the calvados barrel that went into the process. Quite acidic, having a rather juicy middle despite the unmistakenly Belgian soft foamy, ample texture. As its rich malts evoke chocolate, prunes, dates and raisins, its yeast levels it up with fittin desserty spiciness. A sweet offering indeed, if not quite at the same levels than the regular Pannepot, especially with that acidity backing up. Deeply complex, yet I find myself liking it less than the less alcoholic, tighter regular Pannepot whose maltiness seems less cohesive. If the barrels add an extra layer, they also remove from the brightness of the layers underneath. Still, thats one excellent and unique offering.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

2307,"2009-08-26",4.0,"2005 bottle sampled August 2009.

First, let me stress that (regular) Pannepot is one of my favorite beers, period. All of this is to be taken in that context. Pours deep brown with an ample of course head. Rich, lovely, and complex nose: apple and dried fruit, gingerbread spices, plenty of oak (but not way over the top). The flavor is a bit of a letdown, slightly more sour than expected, barrel character obscuring the Pannepot spices, and metallic like biting ones tongue and tasting blood. Relatively sweet, classic Pannepot yeast bite later in the sip, a bit hot on the close even after four years,  Partly, this is just a really challenging beer, I guess. I would have called my first sip about a 3.8 but after slowly sipping for an hour Im appreciating it in the 4.0 range. Still, I fear this fails to live up to (regular) Pannepot -- the barrel character subtracts rather than adds to the essence of that great beer.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2307,"2009-08-04",4.4,"33cl bottle. Pours dark ruby-brown colour with big creamy and mostly lasting light-brown head. Good lacing. Aroma is Moderate malty with bread, grain and roasted malt. Lots of hops in the aroma with flowers, resin and some citrus. Smells of oak and alcohol (something like red wine) too. Body is cloudy because of some sediments wich gives it a good density. Flavor is sweet with some acidity and little bitterness. Bitterness is bigger in the finish, togheter with little sweetness and acidity again. Average duration for the finish. A creamy texture of the body of this beer makes it fully bodied. Lively carbonation. Quite better than the original version to me. Great beer.","Rimini, ITALY","teorn88"

It gets a bit more acidic and bitter with the yeast from the bottle mixed in. Medium body, smooth carbonation, loads of tiny, lively bubbles. Awesome beer.","Årnes, NORWAY","Kestral"

I mean, this beer is a meal unto itself: Lots of spices and chocolate in the flavor. The oak is apparent, but not at all bullish. Funky yeasty aftertaste.

2307,"2009-06-10",4.4,"Where to start with this one? Aroma is fairly sweet, some chocolate, a definite sense of the oak on the nose with some fruitiness that could be described as faint apple aromas. Chocolate malts, some yeast and a slightly more savoury edge. Looks like an impy stout or old ale in glass, very little head, very lazy/soft carbonation, head is a very small tan/grey brown layer over the beer itself which grows big fast when the glass is swirled. Flavour is simply gorgeous. Very soft but very complex. Not at all in your face, its truly like a fine wine with its elegance. Quite restraines but very full flavoured. Starts with a nice sweet/savoury attack somewhere between dark chocolate and black olives, a very subtle tartness in the mids probably from being aged in the Calvados barrels. Lots of chocolate, everything from rich belgian milk choc, to bitter dark choc. Strong maltiness but not at all overpowering, the malt/yeast finish reminds me slightly of Marmite, but with a fruitiness somewhat similar to eating a soft cream chees with a slice of apple and Marmite to boot. This beer is indeed legendary and I prefer it to the normal Pannepot by a long shot, the spicing is all sorted out, the beer as a lovely sensual melowness, right at the end theres almost a rum like quaity of molasses and burnt sugar.

I pour the 33cl bottle (Bar Volo) and watch a medium-viscous pour of deep dark brown form a dense tan head that likes to leave hazy dense rings when swirled. It releases aromas that are subtly vinous, yeasty and gently sweet-malty. Taste is very refined and wine-like with muted muscat grape, raisin, and vanilla with some other subtle dry fruit hints and toffee in the background. French oak character is much rounded, and the vinous tanginess holds on to the long finish. Almost light feel but it activates many parts of the mouth senses.

The aroma is sweet rum and raisin bread, plum, pear, little touches of chocolate, vanilla, and oak, a hefty dose of yeast, and some spicy alcohol notes. The flavor is very fruity, with plum, raisin, black cherry, pear, and a lot of ripe papaya. Behind all that fruit is some rum and oak. Theres quite a bit of sweetness here, and all those sugars give it a sticky, almost syrupy mouthfeel. Spicy alcohol and some wooden bitterness take over the finish, which really helps cut the sweetness and keep it from becoming too cloying. Very tasty beer, though to be honest, I was hoping for a much deeper complexity.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

Bottle, 10%. Vinous aroma. Seemingly clear dark chestnut colour. Small light brown head. The flavour starts off a little acidic and quite vinous. Gets a little boozy, but the booze is almost held off by the woody acidity. Roasted note in the finish. The booze is well-hidden, and not by massive amounts of sugar or roasted malts, so quite well done. On the other hand, why hide the alcohol instead of just making a weaker version?

Nice but more muted than I would have expected. Flavour is similarly quite fruity, dark fruit with a bit of a twang, over a sweet malt and sugar base. Touch of mild wood notes perhaps? Overall the twang of not quite sourness is a bit distracting from the finer fruit and malt character. (7+)  Smooth medium to full bodied palate would benefit from just a touch more carbonation.

2307,"2009-02-09",4.1,"33cL bottle. A meaty fist of alcohol punches my nose and bowls me over with apple-puckered gin. Surprisingly savory and bold. Gutsy. An amalgamation of malt roast and barrel char meet for a real chewy kick of smoke. Pours a vibrant ruby-mahogany, clear with a long, sweeping lace in mocha. Palate gives that explosive foam, Im used to. This follows with a quick dispersion of flavors. Theres definitely a smokey corner to this beer, running over some sweet apple, pear, and almond extract edges. Theres a tangy, aged malt waft that adds some balance to the crispness of the alcohols and the murky underlying fire. This doesnt quite have the sprightly explosiveness I remember with the straight version, but I do appreciate the Calvados inflection and some of the more smokey notes Im picking up in this barrel version. An old-Fullers-like hop dust graces the backend with some lemon character. Even with the barrel addition, this beer maintains its palate deftness without compromise. And thats something I can really appreciate. Warming, the spice picks up steam and adds some needing complexity. Thanks Sammy!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

2307,"2009-01-13",4.4,"Bottle, 33cl. When opening the bottle, and pouring the content into the glass, a wonderful aroma of dried fruits, dark caramel and vinous wood enters my nose. In the glass it has a semi-clear dark, dark brown color with a ruby tint, and on top a fingerthick, beige, creamy head rests and resists all forces trying to diminish it. A fine carbonation is going on too. A further inspection of the aroma reveals that the vinous woody aroma are dominant, but theres also aromas promising a sweet flavor, some prunes and figs, a touch of alcohol of the kind only found in fine spirits and a tiny roasted touch. It may be my mind playing tricks on me, but I think theres a touch of apple-based spirits too. Its very smooth and full-bodied, a pleasant warmth enters after a second or two, and the tiny bubbles spreads in the mouth. Theres a fine vinous and woody flavor and a good dash of sugars. Still, it sort of feels dry in the finish. Theres also some vanilla, dark plums, dried fruits, some fine alcohol and a touch of Port. Warm, sweet and dry finish with dried fruits and plums. Some notes of oxidation too. This is why beergeeks love Belgian beers and Struise. Its complex, tasteful, moreish as hell, and a damn fine beer to enjoy slowly.

2307,"2009-01-09",4.2,"<b>In short: </b>A fruity and vinous Belgian Strong dark ale
<b>How: </b>Bottle 330ml, vintage 2005.  Compared side-by-side with regular Pannepot
<b>The look: </b>Cloudy burgundy topped by a small persistent tan head
<b>In long: </b>Nose is a lot less spicy than the regular Pannepot with a much stronger dark fruits presence.  Not much barrels/oak on the nose, this beer smells like some classic ABTs.  Taste has cake malts and a lot of dark grapes, fresh dark fruits and even gets rather vinous and somewhat sticky.  The floral finish of the regular Pannepot is translates tobacco with the Grand Reserva.  A light herbal spiciness but far from the level of the regular Pannepot.  Very smooth and round.  The vinous & fruit concentrate character of the beer makes it a bit heavy and detracts from the drinkability.  The regular Pannepot is indubitably more drinkable.  Like with the regular Pannepot there was no alcohol presence whatsoever.  I slightly prefer the regular Pannepot but only slightly and the Reserva is the best of the three.  However the Grand Reserva really has a personality of its own and is the best of the three to accompany a meal.  With a basic beer as good as the Pannepot all aging experiments will yield good results.  A Special Reserva aged in MartinTs dirty socks with Rastacoueres post-jogging sweat could even potentially be drinkable.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The aroma was caramel malt, burnt sugar, some peppery spice, and anise.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied, medium carbonated, and had a sharpness on the side of the tongue.

I was expecting far less carbonation due to the barrel aging, but hey what do I know. Aroma is just amazing. Very richly complex, a lot like what I remember of Rochefort 10. French Oak, molasses, brown sugar, funk, prunes/dates, old mashed up apples, a whole bunch of other more subtle things I cant even describe. Flavour is, hmm, odd. One sip is amazing, the next is borderline unpleasant. The flavours come in waves. Starts out sweet then quickly turns very spicy and hot. The specific flavours reflect the aroma. Definitely some acidic feel to it, after the strange but intriguing funkyness. But then some times Im hit with that weird wet dog characteristic that is oh-so gross. Not a dominating presence though. Nice dryness and a mild hint of wine. No major alcohol. Waves and waves of complexities that are very enjoyable. I can’t believe it’s actually 10% abv, there’s absolutely no alcoholic presence one would expect, it’s unbelievably easy to drink. In my less-than-expert opinion this might be better classified as an Abt/Quad. What a strange brew.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"

2307,"2008-09-16",4.2,"2005 Vintage Best by date December 2012; Sampled September 2008
A vigorous pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip glass produces a tightly packed, initially three-finger thick, beige-tan colored head.  The beer is a dark, concentrated plum color with quite a bit of concentrated brown.  When held up to the light the beer shows a hazy, dark cranberry hue.  The aroma is a mix of dark fruit, sweet spiciness, toasted nut notes and some malty, maillard like, almost oxidation induced umami notes.  The nose has specific notes of bergamot, mix with earthy coriander, rich clove, caramelized brown sugar, rich molasses rum notes, light cardamom that gets a bit cola like, as well as rich fruity notes of toasted figs, prunes and caramelized raisins.  The finish has a nice toasted whole grain bread note that takes on a certain nuttiness, this last accentuated by a touch of light sherry character.  This is definitely a rich smelling brew, lots of concentrated, dark leaning malt notes mix quite well with the soft spice notes.

Quite fruity tasting with a certain sweetness and an off-setting tartness.  The finish has a nutty, sherry like edge to it that is definitely signs of oxidation / age, but adds to the complexity instead of detracting.  This beer seems to have just started to age a bit around the edges.  I lick my lips from the first sip and I get a distinct flavor that is a mix of tart tamarind and brown sugar.  Fruit flavors definitely play a role here, more specifically dark fruit notes of concentrated raisins, prunes and a touch of citrus infused figs.  Lots of concentrated malt notes intermingle with the fruit; distinct malt notes of molasses, toasted malt in the finish and perhaps a touch of grain astringency, while the intermingled fruit / distinct malt flavors have me noticing notes of dark rum, brandy and some salty tamarind notes.  There is definitely a distinct, yet soft tartness to this beer that makes the creamy body and rich mouthfeel seem a bit lighter than it actually is.  The oak character is actually quite soft, almost non-existent, though there is just a touch of spicy oak in the finish as well as a touch of a tannic boost.  Spice notes play a slightly lesser role in the flavor, but do still contribute notes of vanilla, clean coriander, clove, perhaps a touch of all spice and a finish that has a spicy cola / cardamom note to it.

This seems to be just getting in to its own right now and this, the 2005, vintage probably still has quite a long way before it starts deteriorating; the best by date of 2012 is definitely not a joke.  I am really enjoying this beer.  The oak character is very soft, which is nice, with the biggest influence being the rum / brandy notes picked up from the calvados cask.  This is a very good beer, one which I easily wish I had more than 330ml of; my bottle is gone way to fast leaving me really wishing that I had more.  If I could make this better I would add a touch more tartness, the lactic note that is here is quite soft and there is lots of fruit and malt character that could easily balance out a touch more sourness.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The taste - initially I am a bit put off, the dry astringent woodiness is almost too forward, and there’s an odd lactic sourness too, but still the spice/raisin/yeast maltiness is complex and rewarding, so great marks from me!  Thick, somewhat squeaky mouthfeel, a tad still (after all that time in-barrel I understand), with a dry tart malty finish.  Overall, very smooth, and while the oak is quite mild in the taste, I expect it to mellow further with another year or so of cellaring - very very good, and worth a revisit down the road.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

The nose is quite distinctly different from the regular Pannepot, its woody, a little sour and not unlike an old aged wine with far less of the toffee and buttery sweetness of thge regular version its quite lovely. The colour is still a hazy brown but its not so murky as the Pannepot and appears quite clear at the top although just seperating a little at the edges, in short this beer looks great and betters the original in the beauty stakes. The taste is quite gorgeous, dark molasses, dried fruits, the warmth of the alcohol is still there but a little more refined, nice sweet and sour edge to this, fruity, some toffee again.

2307,"2008-08-11",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 15, 2011 Rating 1111. 2005 vintage bottle, big, big thanks to cgarvieuk. Shared with my girl at home. Deep walnut pour with a bunch of silky-fine tan foam, good substance to it, sticky lacy bits and a lingering layer. Aroma that changes every time I put my nose in the glass. First sniff, with the beer still settling, was sort of a rancid butter thing. That happily dissipates almost immediately; then its lovely aged Christmas pud, on to big sweet cherries soaked in brandy, raw chocolate, all in a background of well-oiled mahogany. Flavor is some kind of magical raw muscovado sugar, with the lovely subtle sour notes mixed with chocolate, rum, vapory dark fruit. But unlike eating sugar, where a spoonful overwhelms you with sweetness, this has a soft dry finish with just the lightest sweet touch and a nice lingering plum sourness. This comes together beautifully. (August 11, 2008)

Bottle, shared with my girl at home, on the occasion of our 9th anniversary. This bottle also vintage 2005, and also from the amazingly generous cgarvieuk.

2307,"2008-08-04",4.3,"Beer No. 4000 and our third big milestone celebrated with a Struise beer.A Sim rate: This is one of the most amazing aromas Ive ever smelled. Its sour apple jolly ranchers and pear jelly bellies. Its the sweetest red wine vinegar...with truffle. Different every time. Grapes, strawberry. A fruit salad marinated in brandy, just how my dad makes it. And the cream whipped with vanilla essence just to finish it off. The first sip hits you like a rush of brandy. Its tingling on the back of the tongue and hot going down. The flavours arent quite as light and fruity as the aroma. Theyre darker, deeper: red wine and dark cherry chocolate liqeurs. Sneaky brazil nuts usurp the finish. I could drink this all night. Sadly, I only have half a bottle to myself. Im sure that there will be a time and place where I can enjoy more ;) Absolutely delightful.Mess notes:I have had many bottles of this, mainly thanks to Urbain and Carlo but I also have to thank Brad and this one that my lovely Mrs and I are finally getting round to rating at home is thanks to Craig. This is a beautiful looking beer. Its that sort of vampyr black / purple with glorious condition and a good beige head that is a clear trademark of my favourite brewer. When swilled you can see the head seeping into the darkness and it looks amazing, something that would not work quite so well if it were pitch black. Ok, there may be swearing ahead folks, I apologise. Fanfuckingtastic aroma. Its close to a 10. The calvados and wood is clear as day but it dances back and forth like a flirty little tart with nail polish (a smell I love dearly), vintage perfume, cherries, plums and luscious thick alcohol. There is definite Coca Cola in there too. Bollocks to it, thats a 10. Yeah, thats the aroma done I think. The flavour is not quite so good. Dont get me wrong its still bloody excellent but its a little too sugary, the tartness of the Calvados shows a little too clearly and I just can never get into dried fruity notes too much. All that aside, the base of the Pannepot is still evident and that can never be a bad thing. The balance of the sourness against the thick and chewy sweet malt flavours is just excellent. The finish is huge and develops beautifully. There is a huge hit of alcohol too but the rest of the beer is so powerful it carries it really well. This is not my favourite from Struise but is still worthy of a huge score. Struise seriously rock.Numbers: 10/5/8/4/17Incidentally, we had a tasting at the Farm once and Urbain opened about 5 bottles of this, maybe more. As we were all going mad and drinking Mikkeller Black, Peche Mortel, Dirty Horse, Aardnon, etc. etc the 5 PGRs were left on the table (oh the decadence) Sim, good little sport that she is, bravely polished them all off and had nothing more than a sip of everything else.

Dark brown with a small off white head. Sweet malty toffee and candi sugar aroma.

The taste was sweet, sugary and smooth with an edge of sourness. Some bitterness to follow. ’Wonderful,’ I wrote in my notes.

Lots of dried, dark fruit in the flavor, with some oakiness, and sweet, appleish calvados. No alcohol present in the flavor. Medium to full body with soft carbonation. Maybe an inch thin. I think the Reserva was the peak with this one. Now with the additional Calvados aging, the apple sweetness has taken over, masking most of the finesses.

The best is the slight sourness tickling in the background... mm, amazing. Theres also some oaky notes, and you can feel the presence of a finer spirit, like Calvados (havent tried Calvados though - but I guess it is, due to the maturing). Best belgian beer Ive tried.

I´´m uncertain if there is notes of oak, there are some notes that I remember from Amagers oak aged impy stout, but then the oak gives very differens aromas from what can be found in an oakaged redwine. 
After a while only licorice stands back.
Taste licorice, quite seet, dates, figs and some strange acidity, that draws down. After all I think it´s a little better than Pannepot due to a less prominent licorice taste, even though it´s not reflected in my ratings. Gets cloying in the end.","Nibe, DENMARK","rane"

Murky brown colour with pretty big, longlasting, beige head(tulip glass). Aroma is predominantly from the Calvados, after are waves of oak, berries and fruits. No alcohol detected here - the alcohol is overall nowhere to find. Tad sourish smell, probably from the effect of the apples. The backbone in mouthfeel is surprisingly light(due to the oak), which is good here, I found the other 3 Pannepot very sweet.

2307,"2008-05-08",4.2,"On tap at t Brugse Beertje, Brugge, April 2008. Many thanks to Carlo for providing this for Jeremy Grays 40th birthday bash. Im often not convinced that wood aging necessarily adds anything (desirable) to the underlying but I definitely thought it did in this case. It tempered and balanced the sweet fruit. So it ended up fruity and slightly woody, with just a smidgen of tart acidity. Good balance of prune-like fruit and chewy caramel malt, coupled with lots of liquorice. Firm mouthfeel - full but not too fat. If I wanted to nit-pick Id say that the alcohol is perhaps a little too evident but that didnt stop me drinking about four pints of the stuff. Gorgeous, and a not a bit like Coca-Cola harrisoni..","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

2307,"2008-05-02",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2009 My Bottom Line:
This Barrel-Aged Belgian Strong Ale is a veritable playground of complexity where wooden tenements harbor cajoling chocolate and vanilla sweetness, delineating apple orchards and vineyards till the taste horizon fades. This is another delightful Struise product which can age gracefully.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A layer of foam covers the blackened dark brown. Is it me or this one is a shade darker than the regular Pannepot?
-The spice bouquet is not quite as revealing (or blatant, for that matter) as in the regular version.
-The meditative finish provides effective dryness alongisde an alcohol nudge.
-The aroma efficiently foreshadows the flavor profile.
-A peppery splash precedes the vinous fruitiness.
-The body is beautifully ample, with many caramel love handles to hang on to.

This is a hot beer man, but like the ordinary pannepot is soo vasty superior(and also better than the reserva), im hazarding a guess that this beer surely is best as it comes and not barrel aged, which in turn reinforses my idea that 99.999999999999% of beers out there are very much unsuited to barrel aging. Im glad i have another 2 bottles as i think ill age one and have the other with some friends. Im thinking also now that this may infact be more drinkable, in that it slips down very easy, compaired with the regural pannepot, but the complexity of the spice and malty sweetness is missing.","bantervile, Bedfordshire, ENGLAND","DonMagi"

2307,"2008-04-14",3.6,"From a 330mL Bottle.  Tasted side-by-side with the other Pannepots.  Dark brown, ruddy tinged pour with a healthy layer of creamy tan head.  Lots of calvados aromas imparted to the beer, creating a bit of a vinous, dried fruit character.  Notes of chocolate, spice, and tobacco present, but the calvados presence is a bit dominating.  While still inviting, the more subtle nuances of the regular version are up-staged by the boldness of the calvados cask.  Medium bodied, effervescent mouthfeel.  Flavors of chocolate fudge, molasses, and hints of vanilla combine with some boozey stewed apples.  Spicy oak contributes some dryness and light tannins in the finish.  This certainly is a good beer, but the incredible complexity of the base beer is a bit lost in the presence of the calvados.  While I can certainly see how this would be pleasant to some, it leaves me missing the beautiful malt and spice complexity of the regular Pannepot, which was clearly my favorite of the four versions tasted.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

2307,"2008-04-07",4.0,"33cl. bottle at home. Thank you cgarvieuk!: Pours a very dark chestnut brown with a proud, creamy tan head nesting on top. Rising from the glass is a melange of dark dried fruits, tobacco, oak, ash, malt and sugar. Everything leading from one to another. Sometimes the Tobacco or oak seems more present but then the deep dark fruits take over. Every once in a while there seems to be a very light smoke popping up with some brandy. There is also an earthy ""garden after a rainstorm"" feeling. As it warms up some fresher fruit and alcohol start to make their presence known along with some malt and just a smidgen of roast. The only constant throughout everything seems to be the underlying toasted oak. Finally bringing the beer to my lips I am smoothed over by rolling waves of dark fruits and cherries gliding over oak. The mouthfeel starts off by making you think it is just about to turn sticky but thankfully it never gets there. Green apples and whiskey in the back with winter spices. Cherries come back again towards the end but this time in a tart form. Alcohol is a bit more pronounced in the back of your throat than it was on the nose. Green herbal bitterness comes in somewhere just after the first alcohols kick in. Quite complex but I think this should be cellared away in order for it to really shine. I just hope I can keep my hands off of the precious few I have.","Brasschaat, BELGIUM","CapedBrewsader"

Apples, cherries, and wood.  Flavors of toffee, dough, cherries, caramel, oak, alcohol, and spice.  The flavors are sweet but with a light sourness.

The aroma is extremely complex with tones of dried and fresh fruits like prunes, sticky raisins, dried oranges, apples, pears, plums, oven baked bananas and ripe mashed black cherries. Malty with tones of caramel, toffee and dark juicy bread. Brown sugar and dark bread syrup are also present. Spicy tones of anise, vanilla and hints of fresh herbs and hops. Hints of sal ammoniac, cocoa and milk chocolate. The oak shines through just enough to not disturb balance. The sweetness and the sourish tones completes each other perfectly. The flavour is full of dark fruits, dark caramel, some spices, gingerbread, tart apple cider/calvados with a mild coffee and chocolate background. The beginning is caramel sweet but before the beer gets cloying a sourish blanket of tannins from the oak and the calvados sweeps over your taste buds and takes it down to a pleasant sweet note. The mouthfeel is velvety soft and smooth with a elegant tart and dry finish. The aftertaste is of tannins, grapes, dark sugars, apples and some unsweetened dark fruits. Medium to full bodied.

2307,"2008-03-31",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2010 Multiple vintages, including a 4 year old 2005 example at Kulminator.  This one pours a crazy looking, cloudy, muddy, golden-tinted mauve color.  A swirly tan film with a bubbly edge crowns the top in stark contrast to the massive, billowing foam of the regular Pannepot.  The inviting appearance leads into a sweet aroma of luscious caramel, dried figs, raisins, and sweet, concentrated apples.  Silky Belgian yeast and creamy, vanilla-laden barrel notes add depth and complexity.  In the mouth, the sweet-tart apples push their way through the sweeter elements, emerging on the forefront.  Soon after, smooth, figgy dark fruit notes follow in waves, as smooth oak and vanilla round things out beautifully.  The substantial body is smooth, almost aerated and moderately carbonated, resulting in a nice mouthfeel.  Some of the older examples Ive had showed just a tinge of welcomed oxidation.

2307,"2008-03-17",4.2,"Cleveland tasting
Thanks to mike for cracking this open early on while the palate was still fresh.  If Struisse did nothing but Pannepot they would be exceptional.  Everything they do above and beyond sets them that much further apart.  Something about this one makes it better than standard Pannnepot.  I cant pin down what it is other than perhaps the extra aging.
Aroma / Appearance - Sticky lacing clings to the sides before cascading into the deep caramel brown base.  Chestnuts, plum, chocolate and oak are most evident in this rich blend of scents.  It is almost on par with St Bernardus Abt 12 or Rochefort.  If I was classifying this blindly it might just have been a quad.
Flavor / Palate - Chocolate pudding, caramel and chestnut soothe the senses.  Next comes a dark fruitiness blended with wood and oranges.  The cherry finish caps off an excellent beer that belongs near the top of everyones list.  It is not missing anything which leads me to wonder what the brewers can do to top this in the future.  If this hits the states I will definitely be buying some.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

I had the chance on the Saturday after ZBF to have a session drinking regular and Reserva Pannepot at The Kulminator and I must admit that the regular is my favourite.

2307,"2008-01-31",4.7,"33 cL bottle. Pours dark brown, murky, almost black. Shows initially a huge light brown head, diminishes into a little lacing and with little alcohol thick curtains on the glass. Aroma is peppery, vanilla, dark malty toned and slight woody. Also quite alcohol dominated aroma, but not burning or unpleasant. Smooth flavour, dark malt/cane sugarish spice notes, caramel, liqourish like toffee, mild raisin note - not sweet though. Mild chocolate note too. Alcohol presence. Finish holds a nice liqourice and alcohol finish, cane sugarish dry woody note into the far finish, smooth and pleasant. WOW.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"
2307,"2008-01-30",4.1,"Bottle at Delirium in Brussels. Sweet, dark fruits are checked by light, vinous tannins and mild bitterness. Soft, velvety carbonation somehow gives the impression of lighter body... dangerously easy to drink, considering the alcohol and process behind this beer. Finishes a touch dry. Warming. Delicious. One to contemplate for sure. Hope to try it again soon.","Berlin, GERMANY","JoeinDahlem"
2307,"2008-01-25",4.4,"Bottle at Ølbutikken (in a plasticglass) and at home (in a wineglass) - shared with Mette. Dark dark brown (almost black) - light brown head. Apples (calvados), fruity, light burned, berries, licorice, light rubber, light light alcoholic. LIght sharp finish. And a lot more - very complex - Very nice !!!!","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Theis"
2307,"2008-01-23",4.8,"Hazy dark brown with tiny light brown head leaving laces. Aroma is sweet and spicy with roasted malt liquerice and overripe fruits. Flavor is moderate sweet with overripe fruits, liquerice, pepper, oak and roasted malt. Full bodied and very complex. Finishes light hoppy. Near perfect!!!","Frederiksberg C, DENMARK","KimJohansen"
