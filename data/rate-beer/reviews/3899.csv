3899,"2017-05-06",4.1,"(On tap @ CBC 2016 Yellow Session, Copenhagen) Pours a very deep and dark red-purple with a huge pink head that fades. Aroma is quite tart lactic acidity and sour berries, but also sweet notes of powdered sugar on blackberry and mixed berry notes behind, a hint of malt, nice balance. Flavour is semi-sweet to start, blackberry, black currant-like notes, yoghurty lactic acid underneath, quite rich fruit overall, drying in the finish with a bit of oak and berry seeds. Medium oily body with soft effervescent carbonation. Really nice fruited Berliner, great balance, not an acid bomb at all. Played tricks with me though, Id have sworn it was a blackberry beer.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"
