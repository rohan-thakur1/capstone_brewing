Appearance : Slightly hazy blond with a big fluffy head thanks to a hard pour. Long head retention, nice lacing.

Aroma : Rich bready and slightly toasted malts. Some earthy hops with floral and citrusy notes. Some wet earthy notes.

Taste : Great malty-bready notes. Earthy and citrusy hops. Moderate bitterness. Finish is malty, with notes of slightly burnt bread crust. Earthy and citrusy. Rich and rustic. 

Palate : Soft and pillowy carbonation. 

Overall : Im so glad that Martin was able to share this with me. Really interesting stuff. Amazing to see how such a simple malt and hop bill can draw your attention and be so expressive and substantial. Really nice rich rustic malt. Great malty persistence.

4531,"2013-03-17",4.3,"My Bottom Line:
Baguette crusts, rustic, hay-like malts and hop spiciness coalesce in this bitter, herbal Svetly.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A pillowy head of foam sits still atop the misty golden.
-The mouthfeel is predictably (and deliciously) frothy, fluffy, comfortable.
-Hops possess a subtly citrusy, herbal and peppery personality that is quite engaging in the second half.
-Flavor profile is balanced, but the hop bitterness takes over in the finish.
-This is a beautiful baguette of a Svetly. You can even imagine a lightly tart fruitiness within the crust which vanishes instantly when it touches the center of the baguette.
-The more I drink this beer, the more I want. Next time Im going to Czechia, Im bringing back more than these 2 1.5-liter bottles..

4531,"2011-12-11",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2014 From draft at Kulovy Blesk.  Nefiltrovany.  Lightly hazed gold body with perfect looking and long-lasting fluffy white head.

Snappy, crisp, zesty and superbly clean with incredible smoothness. Beautiful hop bouquet.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
