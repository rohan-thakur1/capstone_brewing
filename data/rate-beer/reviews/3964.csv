3964,"2017-06-12",3.9,"Pours dark brown, almost black bit a nice tan head. Aroma has some freshly brewed coffee, spruce and pine needles. Some sweeter notes there as well. Taste is super balanced, hop character is still strong but roast is not overpowering and blends in with hops in the finish. Grapefruit seed bitterness combines with dark and deep spicy rye malt character, light roast comes out mainly in the aftertaste. I really like the balanced character of this one, drinks dangerously smoothly, especially when compared with most of the other Black IPAs I have tried.","ESTONIA","jinroh"

3964,"2017-01-27",5.0,"Best fucking rye beer ever. Blows most CDA or ""American Black Ale""s out of the water. This was my #1 @ OBF 2013, the line of laps. You know, where youre on day 4 and taking victory laps.

BTW hot tip - we had to make a couple new rules this year @ OBF 2016. That International tent...if I didnt love beer so much I would have thought their CDA (I cant recall brewery, but the Netherlands) was shameful because it stomped all over the locals. Its like it has .... THE NAME CASCADIA(N) right tf in it.

oh yeah. The rules.

Okay. So in 2016, we noticed this thing, but not till thursday...I got in late on weds, my bad. But anyhow...rule developed.

first rule. (which was actually developed after the second rule because we noticed it first) 

When you get to OBF 2017, IMMEDIATELY AND WITHOUT HESITATION go to the international tent and DRINK ALL THE BEERS. Youll understand why in a second.

In 2016, we noticed something. We were bouncing around, still polishing off the main 88+ stragglers/fillers, and crossed paths a few times with the IT (for brevity). I was rinsing a glass (they had no line at their dedicated rinse station) and saw two kegs blow, IIRC both from China. See the cool thing about the IT is that its not a bunch of international beer styles - its people from other parts of the world brewing OUR styles. Full circle, my friends. You are loved.

Anyhow.

The second rule is to make sure to troll by every 30-45 min and ensure something hasnt cropped up. Some were deep - they had their kegs like all week long; others had many unlisted. Yeah. the clue came when my overly and overtly pedantic friend tried to reconcile his tap list.

Yes. We actually had two unlisted taps and missed who knows how many. We also missed one of the listed. Poof...one keg, apparently.

So, those are the rules. Out of my IT picks, its a toss up between Hell and Damnation (Hel & Verdoemenis) and the Dutch CDA...

(an IPA of any type should have more head retention as the hop oils aid in retention). This brew is a thick and very dark black. No light penetration at all here.

Very strong citrus and pine aroma (hops). Along with the powerful hop aroma, there is also a rich coffee and charred grain scent.

A decent hop bite right up front, not a ridiculous amount though. The bitterness is quickly cut by a rich, buttery, sweet malt flavor. There are flavors of coffee, toffee, chocolate, wood, nuts, caramel, and smoked grains. VERY RICH!

Full bodied brew. Very thick feeling and a bit oily.

3964,"2015-12-21",4.3,"BOD 10/16/15. Pours black as a starless night with dark ruby edges. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

World class nose of rich citrus (tangerine, pineapple, orange) over a slightly sweet malt base with a strong caramel note and a subtle rye spiciness. Underneath the fruity esters a dark malt presence lurks, but never makes it to the forefront.

Light medium body with a rich smoothness that is slightly oily at times and has a bit of creaminess in the finish. World class carbonation with a strong effervescent middle and a roiling finely bubbled prickly finish.

The flavor profile is outstanding, but falls short of world class due to the failure to completely cover the alcohol. Slightly sweet fruits lead and flow into a caramel based sweetness prior to the middle. The middle brings a moderate bitterness that is rind in nature (orange, not grapefruit). Dark malts arrive with more of a char rather than roast character along with a mild rye flavor and even more subtle spiciness. As the bitterness subsides, caramel makes its strongest influence and, unfortunately, so does the grain alcohol flavor and slight astringency. The finish is slightly dry and leaves a slow fade of alcohol, char, caramel and rye .","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

Je ne saurais en expliquer la raison, mais ces bouteilles mexcitent au plus haut point. Il faut dire que les 3 que jai dégustées jusquà présent ont toutes été dimmenses coup de coeur! Celle-ci ne fait nullement exception à la règle. La bière est noire comme la nuit la plus noire, à lexception de sa mousse dun blanc cassé, généreuse, onctueuse et collante au verre. Le plaisir que jéprouve en faisant danser le liquide dans mon verre et de regarder les dentelles se former et se transformer...Nez intense de fleurs, de fruits tropicaux et dagrumes. Les vapeurs qui montent à mes narines regroupes les caractéristiques dune multitude de traits de différentes IPA et chacun de ces traits est parfaitement clair et juste. Je passe des prés au litchi, au citron, à la mangue, à la clémentine... Cest prodigieusement complexe et agréable! En bouche le liquide est tout aussi flamboyant: la base maltée et torréfiée sert de fondation solide à ces saveurs de fruits, dalcool de seigle et de bois. Le liquide est plutôt mince et bien serré dont est sans doute responsables le séjour en barriques. Jamais je nai dégusté une black IPA qui men offrait autant: je passe sans arrêt de la IIPA blonde east coast fruitée à une bière noire granuleuse, torréfiée aux notes de café. To Sam (brewer at FW brewery), I am more than honoured to met you that day at 3 Fonteinen brewery! We also shared a bottle of Lou Pepe Framboise at Cantillon a week later.

Would it be frowned upon if Firestone just automatically received a 4.0 for their beer across the board? Because I really have a hard time not loving everything they make. Theyre like the West Coast version of New Glarus. A fantastic IPA (whether its black or not is no matter), with a phenomenal aroma. A big piney/citrus haymaker punch right to the olfactory sensory, and an uppercut sweet tropical fruits and cattyness. The more I smelled it, the more the cattyness comes out in this. The guys at FW must have dry-hopped the beejeezus outta this, because the flavor is quite subdued compared to the aroma. A nice balance of sweet malts, tropical fruits, floral hops and fresh bread. A big full body helps keep all these flavors from getting lost and in the end, you wind up with one great friggin beer.

3964,"2014-09-10",3.7,"Transfer from BA review on 5-10-13-

 Poured from a bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a deep brown nearly pitch black color with a one finger tan colored head. The head fades relatively quickly leaving a nice level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell- The aroma is a blend of hoppy smells and more roasted smells as would be expected for a black IPA. The roasted smells are largely of a coffee and toasted malt aroma with the hop being predominantly of a pine and earthy smell. While these are the bulk aromas other aromas of grapefruit and chocolate find their way to the nose as well giving a rather robust and dark smelling brew.

 Taste  The taste begins much heavier of lightly roasted malt and a rye flavor more than of anything else. Upfront there is only a lighter presence of a grapefruit citrus hop, but as the flavors advance this changes, with flavors of pine hop increasing in strength throughout the taste. A light chocolate flavor seems to come and go in the taste, being taken over in the end by an earthy hop flavor as well as some roasted coffee flavors. The roasted coffee gets quite potent toward the end, overshadowing the rest of the flavors, to leave a rather coffee bitter and moderately hoppy roasted flavor on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the brew was on the average side in terms of its thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that was on the average side as well. A slightly thicker body may have been slightly better for the roasted flavors of the brew, but even so, the feel was quite all right. 

 Overall  A pretty decent black IPA, but nothing too outstanding in my mind. It ended with a bit too much coffee bitterness, which took away from much of the nice hop undertones that were present. It was worth the try, but not one I would go back to with any real occasion.","","Darkmagus82"

3964,"2014-08-14",3.4,"Black IPA with a 60( IBU ) Internal Bittering scale. The SRM/(L Scale) and EBC counts both high as well which is unique for a IPA. Seems a lot of breweries got into this Pine and Citrus fad challenging the boundaries of what a typically dark rich malty beer can be.

f.W here has added spicy rye which is evident in the 8.3%. Enough alcohol to control typically more fragile Hoppy IPAS shelf live also a real earthy kinda deal unfiltered and unrefined. 

Intense in a good way. Probably not a starting pitcher , more a strong closer to finish the night. Seems like instead of a Imperial IPA with double strength 1/2 IPA/ 1/2 dark with the rye kicker.

This brew had neither the rye I prefer, frankly if it wasn't for ""rye"" in the name I wouldn't know it was supposed to be in there, nor the malt backbone usually present in the black ipa's. This is still a good beer without labels however not what it is billed as.

The appearance has a black body with a three finger off-white foamy head, leaves some clingy slightly foamy lacing in rings.
The smell has some slightly roasted coffee. There is some rye, slight citrus/pine coming through in a spicy sort of way.
The taste is mainly bitter, some slight coffee - but mainly subdued, hopped - yes, but balanced and extremely flavorful. There is a dry yet bittersweet aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, its about a medium, comes across fairly sessionable - maybe perhaps, and the ABV slightly felt.

3964,"2013-12-25",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2014 This is the best Black IPA Ive ever had. Very smooth. Pours a dark black color with a good creamy looking tan head. Aroma is complex; in fact, one of the most complex of the IPA category in general. The malt aroma is there, but the floral hops are slightly present, but not too much. Pine is there but not overwhelmingly so. The taste meets up to the smell. Very smooth. A little bit of bitterness on the front, but some malt at the end.

3964,"2013-12-21",4.1,"650ml bottle poured to pint glass. Piney hop scent jumped from the bottle. Black body with red hue and a tan head. Roasted malts and rye blend well and give off a sweet smell that wasn't apparent with the first whiff offers bottle that was all hops. The hops give it a nice freshness but really not a very bitter drink. I get mostly pine from the hops but lots of complexity from the rye an other malts working together. Good stuff.

Aroma is surprising. Lots of evergreen mixed with lavender, tangerine, and booze. Appearance is stylistically spot-on for a dark IPA. Dark brown/black body that isnt opaque, but is close enough if youre looking from a few feet. White-khaki head leaves beautiful lacing in my Firestone snifter. Taste is the moneymaker for this beer. First wave is all hop; citrus, pine, grapefruit, grass. Second wave is where the malts and spicy rye take over; chocolate, mild roast coffee, light toffee, and a spicy finish. After a few sips I realize this is actually a pretty juicy, citrusy hop profile, and am amazed that the brewers could integrate that so seemlessly with the malt character. Palate is heavier than expected for an IPA, but what Id expect for a black IPA. I really like the juicy palate and taste I first experience, and how that is replaced by a drier, roastier finish.

The sip starts smooth, with a lightly carbonated hoppy ale hitting your tongue.

Then it happens.....

The hop blast. 

This is a very hoppy beer. Overloads of citrus and pine buzz around and on your tongue. Then you realize the buzzing is because you have a ridiculously grainy beer assaulting your mouth.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured pretty much black with and average tan head. The aroma had moderate coffee, dark chocolate, grain, roasted and burnt malts; moderate pine, grapefruit, orange and earthy hops; hints of smoke and a little dark fruit. The initial flavor was lightly sweet and moderately bitter; while the finish was moderately sweet and heavily bitter with a long duration. There was roasted malt, burnt malt, bitter dark chocolate, slightly smokey, pine hops, grapefruit, orange hops, spicy rye, a little grain, hints of coffee, and something sort of smokey and earthy.

Some alcohol, sweet at first but resolving to semi-dry, light/watery body, medium bitterness lasting into the long and hop-drenched aftertaste.  Thankfully, the roast/black patent isnt punishing, and the rye porter-type malt and the hops is nothing short of masterful.  Yes!

Quite simple in the nose...tons of raw hops, but at least there is enough malt character to keep it from being utterly one-dimensional.

Thanks to tastybeer for sharing this. A well balanced black IPA, it has all the aspects of a top notch West Coast beer. I havent tried many Firestone Walker releases but I do not see turning them down if offered. So far all have been solid.

Aroma / Appearance - Carbonated and murky, the black base is decorated by a sheen of cocoa head. Malty notes carry coffee grounds and deep hops. The vegetatal aspect is distracting unfortunately.

Flavor / Palate - Hopped up black coffee sparks the palate into action. A resiny feel rests on the back of the throat. Well rounded this does not have any big surprises. However neither does it disappoint. This is recommended if you pick up a fresh bottle.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed fresh soon after the beer was first released.

In long: Nose is bright and hoppy with green pine needles, grapefruits, green hops pellets and toasted rye bread.

3964,"2012-12-13",4.0,"I saw it and it had to be mine, and for $8 a bomber, I knew it would be a one time affair. Massive spicy, smokey, roasted resinous aromatic nonsense. Not necessarily appealing, but very intense. Oily blackish brown, greasy, lacy head everywhere. Man is it bitter, but it has that black burnt malt semisweetness that balances so well. Long, resin filled presence at the back of the palate that will last until you consume something else. Heavy and punishing like a linebackers blitz. Not for the faint of stomach, even if not exactly a boozey brew.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","Scrapersnbeer"
3964,"2012-12-12",4.5,"22oz bomber. Pours jet black with thick head. Medium carbonation. Not as much hop aroma as I would expect. Big citrus hop flavor. Rye spice is balanced perfectly with the hop and yeast characters to make one outstanding beer.

3964,"2012-11-15",4.0,"22oz., bottling date 9/21/12.  Roasty, hoppy aroma, full of dark malts and earthy, piney, lightly citric hops, featuring some spiciness from the rye, black bread, and a faint, dark fruit and chocolate character in the background, overall quite nice, really.  Quite black in color indeed, only showing some dark brown highlights when held directly to the light, otherwise as inky as night, with a very fine, uneven head, some abstract wisps of lacing here and there and is unfiltered as advertised, but I saw only a slight amount of sediment, which I therefore went ahead and poured.  Flavor is a very nicely balanced combination of dark, very gently roasty, sweet, toffeeish malts, grainy, spicy, rye, some light cocoa and tobacco showing through before an influx of citric, piney, earthy, resinous hop flavors and bitterness.  Finishes with a blend of cocoa, prune, faint licorice and even a touch of coffee.  Active but very fine effervescence on the palate, lightly oily and ultimately dry, body is full.  Super tasty.  This is a great example of the style.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
3964,"2012-11-14",4.3,"Aroma:  Intense aroma, almost explodes in your face when you move in for a sniff.  The pine and rye scent is extremely potent, a little tobacco, sweetness.  I think the best aroma Ive so far smelled.  Appearance:  Perfect actually, a dark black appearance that is completely opaque, the head is a white head with excellent lacing that lasts beyond when you start drinking.  Taste:  Amazing, the taste is different from the smell, but still maintains some of the pineness, but a coffee and earthy flavor immediately pops up.  Strong for an IPA, nice.  A tiny bit of alcohol at the end.  Palate:  Weakness and wateriness comes up around the end, but a nice palate nontheless.  Overall:  Definitely the best Black IPA Ive tried, although its a small arena.  Excellent beer though, Firestone signature is 3 for 3 so far.","","buttslamify"

Smells of grapefruit, maybe some orange, some rye, perhaps some carmel, a tiny bit of roasted qualities. Has some resinous qualities, but expected more on the nose. Taste starts with the resinous hops: some grapefruit, some mango, pine. Nice carbonation and feels crisp on the tongue. Then in the middle you get a nice creamy texture that washes out the resinous qualities of the hops and makes for a much smoother, yet spicier beer from the rye. On the finish, the beer transforms into more hops, including some pine and more floral and fruity qualities. In addition, there emerges a nice addition of roasted and rye malts; almost a coffee-like finish along with the hop qualities. Very interesting how the beer shifts halfway through the flavor profile and then comes back with more intense flavors on the back end. Medium body with a slick and creamy texture. Gets more complex as it warms. I think this is a really good beer, but I dont think it lives up to the hype it receives.

Pours very dark borwn, nearly black. Two fingers of light tan head after a hard pour. Head has good retention and lacing, slowly dissipating into a thin cap. Smells of hops and roasted malt. The taste is hoppy up front, fading into flavors of rye and roasted malts. Not tasting much alcohol, despite the relatively high percentage. Moderate to heavy body. Medium carbonation and not a super clean finish. Leaves a mild resinous hop feeling/taste in the mouth (not necessarily a negative). Relatively palatable considering the hops and alcohol content. A nice take on a rye IPA. Would consider drinking again, although I feel Firestone-Walker has better offerings (e.g. double jack).","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Brouwerij"

This is quite a brewery that i will describe later.  The black IPA poured a deep black with a creamy tan head.  This was a wonderful beer experience and an outstanding IPA.    The bitterness was balanced and ended well in the finish.  The small tan head stayed with the ale and the carbonation was soft.  Great beer in a wonderful brewpub. Enjoyed  a bomber  in December.

3964,"2012-10-20",3.9,"22 oz bottle served in a Midnight Sun chub. Bottled 7/19/12.

A: Pours a dark black color with a one inch pillow of light tan foam forming on the pour. The retention is very nice on the initial pour and the head leaves nice sheets of webbing down the sides of the glass.

S: Grainy rye, mild citrus and light pine are most prominent up front. Slight roast with a semi-sweet bakers chocolate as well.

T: Hoppy notes in large quantities bombard each sip. Light citrus fruit flesh, dried rye with a hint of spiciness, and some mild pine as well. The roast comes in towards the finish with some slight chocolate as well. The hops and rye are really the stars of the show in this one and it seems a tad imbalanced.

M: Medium bodied with a medium carbonation level. The finish is slightly sweet with a mild drying quality to it.

O: This beer was definitely good. I just feel that it missed more of the roasty and darker qualities in the flavor profile. It walked the walk, but didnt talk the talk. It still has a good taste, but gets docked some points for the imbalance.

3964,"2012-10-19",3.9,"Reviewed 9/29. Thanks to Momar42 for the bottle! About 6 oz poured into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a very dark brown color. The head is a one finger offwhite color with somewhat thick bubbles and good retention.

S: Fairly citrusy, but with that green piny note to it - Simcoe hops, perhaps? The darker malts dont really come through, but the citrusy profile redeems things.

T: Much like the aroma, the citrusy flavors come through strongly. The first few sips are a bit questionable in its balance and drinkability, but once this opens up, it becomes quite pleasant in conjunction with the rye malts. Further sips show some chocolate in its profile. This *is* an older bottle, but still very enjoyable, if a little lacking in complexity.

M: Pretty dry - thank you rye malts - and drinkable. Its not too heavy or light either way in terms or body, nor is it overcarbonated.

O: Its another ""man, this could have been AMAZING"" fresh situation with this. Right now, though, its still really damn good. Ill be on the lookout for a fresh bottle/keg of this.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

3964,"2012-09-27",4.2,"Pours a very dark, deep brown with a tan head.  Aroma is a bit different, as this is a rye IPA.  The rye is very noticeable, but pine impressions are dominant.  Grapefruit and caramel round this out.  The taste is extreme in pine and hops.  There is still a good amount of rye underneath.  I get some coffee as well, with this one being very earthy and toasty altogether in this respect.  Very dry.  Thicker in body with a chewy mouthful.  Aftertaste is long lasting, with a burnt flavor of pine and rye.  This has a great hoppy kick as well.  I must say that this a fantastic beer.  Big flavor, strong yet not overpowering, and a cool name to boot.    And in my part of the world, this is quite a bit cheaper than many mediocre selections that I have.  Without a doubt, this one shouldn't be missed.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"

3964,"2012-09-25",4.3,"22oz bottle, thanks to my mom for providing me with my first couple FW brews. Bottled 8/21/12. Surprisingly light body for the ABV. Very soft, smooth carbonation. More dry texture. Really nice balance of roasty malts and delicious hops. Hops are earthy, spicy, and piney. Light bitterness, spice taste. Some sweetness. Good foamy half inch light brown head. Nice history of lace. Dark but not completely opaque color. Great roasty hoppy aftertaste, hint of coffee in there. Toasty, grainy rye complements this excellently. This is a potent brew with that rare combination of incredibly good, incredibly easy to drink. Its got a bit of everything I love - hoppiness and roastiness - that holds my attention, and is a fine example of what I love about the Black IPA.

The flavor beautifully combines smoky malts with pine and citrus hops in a way that is at first bold with its hop bite but quickly is met with the dark roasted malts that offer smoothness and complexity.

3964,"2012-08-22",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 2, 2016 My Bottom Line :  
This complex Black IPA is the stage for the blooming of pine, citrus fruit and flowers within caramel, chocolate and roastiness.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A creamy veil of foam decorates the darkest brown.
-The bottle conditioning job is excellent.
-All flavors are levelled and ever-so-scrumptious.
-Vanilla notes are also there, as is bread.

The aroma is just like an IPA, deceiving, with caramel malts dominating.  As dark as this is, there is practically no roasted malt presence, no chocolate, no harshness in the nose.  They got the black without subjecting you to roast!  This is now, officially, my favorite black IPA.  In the mouth, a woody, unique (but tame) roasted malt character controls your destiny.

3964,"2012-08-04",4.4,"A steady pour into my Bruery Tulip produces a three finger thick, brown tinged, tan colored head; the beer leaves quite a bit of lacing stuck to the sides of my glass as it recedes. The beer is a dark, concentrated brown color that shows a brilliantly clear, concentrated amber / dark-plum color when held up to the light. The aroma is hugely, expressively, hoppy; ample lychee, concentrated tangelo zest, concentrated floral citrus, kumquat zest, apricot, and guava are all noticeable. Softer, supporting notes of toasted, whole grain bread that has been lightly burnt, dark grain husks, and hop notes of herbal, slightly dank, pine, and touches of woodiness. The non-fruit side of the hop character is accentuated by the roast aromatics, and I like that it plays only a supporting role here; so often the dark / roast notes in Black IPAs make the hops harsh and sharp, and this just isnt that.

Sharply bitter up front, with a zippy carbonation that accentuates the bite, bitter roast malt, and a lingering, toasted whole grain character in the finish. Floral, fruity, expressive hop character defines this beer; it is a bit reduced from the nose, as the roast malt plays more of a role in the flavor, but still one can easily notice notes of lychee, tangelo zest, orange blossom nectar, and huge peach flavors. Sharper hop notes of pine, hints of dank character, touches of herbal notes, and even some lingering menthol. The body of this beer is quite light, this is dangerously quaffable, and drinks a lot lighter than a beer of this strength should; there is just enough viscosity and malt body to this beer to carry the fruity hop character.

This is a beer that is right up my alley; this is the best hop expression that I have had in a Black IPA, the focus on floral, tropical fruit, and citrus is just something I cant deny. I really like that the roast malt doesnt get in the way of the hop character; so often it adds harsh, acrid notes to the hops, and it just doesnt do that at all here. This is a beer I wouldnt mind having a whole lot of in the beer fridge.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3964,"2012-07-05",4.0,"I poured a 22oz bomber into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Pitch black body in the glass. Forms a light tan, creamy/rocky head which lingers and laces extremely well.

Smell: Quite piney, almost resiny or astringent hop aroma. Definite citrus or tropical fruit juice concentrate or other underlying sweetness. 

Taste: The ""Black IPA"" is such a relatively new category in brewing its hard to criticize a beer for ""deviating from the style"" when it isnt entirely agreed upon yet. And while Firestone Walker Wookey Jack is by no means a bad beer, I might fault it for just not living up to my expectations. If I were drinking this blind I think Id peg it as a standard IPA. 

It starts off with the more dank, East Coast-style pine and resin bitterness. Some tropical fruit and citrus sweetness riding shotgun, but not so prominent as youd normally associate with a West Coast IPA. As it transitions to the second half a rush of rye spicy dryness swoops in. It works with the hoppy bitterness quite well, although it might account for the rather dry, almost cloying aftertaste. Its a delectable, robust palate to be sure, but not all that complex. Theres a noticeable lack of stout-like qualities such as roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and other associated flavors and features. 

Drinkability: With a thin, very soft, almost tepid mouthfeel and complete lack of alcohol taste or warmth, youd never know this beer is 8.3% ABV. Its almost a little too drinkable for it is. The texture walks a fine line between velvety smooth and flat-out watery. The hops linger and dry out the mouth, but thats to be expected. Still, Firestone Walker Wookey Jack goes down very smooth and would seem to be very versatile.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

22 oz bomber poured into a pint glass. Color of dark walnut with a thick tan head and lots of lacing. Aroma is anise, coffee, and a hint of chocolate--surprisingly malty. Once you start drinking, however, the IPA qualities show up a little more. It's pretty heavily hopped, but they come across as sweet peach and citrus flavors--more subtle than I'd expect. 

Unlike most of the other rye beers I've had, you don't really get much of a rye flavor in this. It's definitely there, but there are enough complexities in the beer that it's never really in your face.

Aroma is bursting with fresh citra hops - lots of mango, pineapple and orange/tangerine, almost in a sense of Turkish delights as is very sweet and pungent. A nice and delicate malt profile that provides dark bread, caramel and cocoa nibs. Just the right balance between the up front hops and the cozy dark malty profile. The taste os very similar to the aroma, that means lots of fresh hoppiness, mainly in the tropical fruity side of the spectrum with additional grapefruit and lemon zest notes. The maltiness is even less pronounced in the taste, leaving only faint hints of roasted malta and burnt caramel on the palate. It turns into a roasted bitterness in the after taste that goes hand in hand with the dank, hoppy bitterness. Maybe a bit of astringent rye spiciness, but definitely not bursting with rye qualities.

The aroma was amazing to me when I had it straight from the bottle -- a positively dark, complex grain. If anything remained the same, however, it was the palate: A bit too thick for me and my kind of IPAs (regardless of IPA type), but otherwise smooth and creamy. I like to rate beers a bit after its opening rather than at first tick (at least thats how Ive evolved as a rater) so I say about its taste the following: Minutes later, what it actually is, is a dark and dry, slightly sticky, grainy ale, that has a hoppy little pop; good, but not my thing.

3964,"2012-06-02",4.2,"Appearance:  Pours a midnight red with a tight creamy tan head. Leaves a foam coating behind.

Aroma: Strong hop aroma. Pine and grapefruit. This is the nose I look for in a Black IPA. You should be able to close your eyes and not be able to tell what color the beer is. I could compare the nose on this to Stones 15th Anniversary or Sublimely Self Righteous, which to me, is magical.

Taste:  Starts with agressive piney hop bitterness, earthy slightly toasted rye, Finishes with long bitterness. Not sweet or fruity in the slightest. Lots of agressive bitterness and earthy character that lingers well after the sip.

Mouthfeel: Full bodied, slightly creamy with average carbonation.

Overall:  The only thing this beer shares with Union and Double Jack is the last name.  This beer isnt fruity or sweet, but rather rustic, agressive and bitter.  This is one of the most rye pronounced Rye beers Ive had since Bruerys Rugbrod, and will take you by surprise.  I need to drink a few more glasses to see if this will go on my Firestone favs list.  I give this beer a lot of props and points for being a true Black IPA and not an over marketed porter. At $6-7 a bomber, you should pick up a few bottles to try.

Excessive burnt note, plus the catty hops, here giving the idea of a burnt blackcurrant pie. Bit sharp MF, finishing a tad empty on top of the rest. Pretty disappointing, certainly for this accomplished brewery. Overdose of citra?","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

3964,"2012-05-07",3.9,"Large head coming out of bottle. Dark black body. Make no mistake of it. This IS an IPA with the first mouth full you take. VERY BITTER. Bit of aftertaste like apricot and peach. Not a huge fan of IPAs, but I could drink this one again.","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"
3964,"2012-05-07",3.7,"Bottle. Pours muddy cola-brown with a medium tan head that subsides in several seconds.  Aroma is sweet and fruity hops with just a hint of roasted malt and chocolate.  Flavor follows suit, with plenty of upfront sweet citrus hoppiness with a remarkably well-balanced peppery, roasty, chocolate foundation.  Hop bitterness and a lasting burn on the finish.  I really loved this initially, but the abrasive finish became too much and detracted from the otherwise great flavors.","Seattle, Washington, USA","crackedmachine"
3964,"2012-05-07",3.3,"22oz bottle.  Pours dark brown with a fluffy light tan head that retains well and laces the glass.

The aroma is roasted chocolate malts, resiny hops and some spicy rye.

The flavor is roasted dark malts with a weird blend of rye and charred plasticky resiny bitterness.  The bitterness is fairly harsh and lingering in the finish.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation.

Overall, I really wanted to like this beer, but it just did not mesh at all.  It did mellow a bit as I drank it, but still was overly abrasive and unbalanced with off-notes.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Beaver"
3964,"2012-05-05",3.4,"From a bottle. Pours deep, deep brown -- black once its in the glass. Grassy citrus hops on the nose, with a little something extra -- a depth thats not often found in black IPAs. Must be the rye. I appreciate this -- the novelty of black IPAs has faded, and too many places think the style is still fine enough on its own. The earthiness of the rye really does add something to this one. The flavor is downright strange. Adds a meaty element, and really covers the hops far too well. The description says that the malts careen into the hops -- true, but careening isnt necessarily a good idea -- it usually ends in complete destruction. Wed like a symphony, not a careen -- this brew is something like what would have happened if Al Gore had careened into George W Bush in 2000, annihilating both of them. What are we left with? Bob freaking Dole. Meh.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

3964,"2012-05-04",4.1,"Pours a deep brownish black with a thin body and a brown frothy head. Aroma is roasted malts, rye, citrusy hops. Flavor is piney and hop forward with hop bitterness and roasted malts. As the flavor combination migrates from the front to the back of the tongue citrus and sweetness and hop nectars evolve into hop bitterness, grapefruit, and bitter roasted chocolate like flavors. At $6 a pop this is a fantastic value for a black IPA of this quality.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Rusty"
3964,"2012-05-04",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2012 First thing that I notice is the pine grapefruit nose.  Medium body.  The malts take a backseat to the hop and the pepper like spicyness, from the beginning to the end.  Some burnt roast is in the background.  Finish is a long bitter dryness that seems to last forever.  For this reason I didnt care for Wookey, even though it is a well made beer.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","beerbastard"

Nice rye spiciness and malt roastiness in the nose along with notes of black coffee, a bit herbal, earth, light citrus, and pine. Rich dark chocolate malty, spicy rye, a bit charred flavor.

Taste is nicely balanced with grapefruit, pine, rye bread and rye spicness, roasted malts, and some caramel notes.  Has a medium full body with a creamy, slightly oily mouthfeel and a dry, bitter, spicy finish.  overall, a very nice black IPA that make great use of rye.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","skmikeg"

3964,"2012-04-29",3.6,"bottle.  one of the better renditions in the narrow ""black IPA"" style, many of which exhibit a very similar character of roast and resinous hops muddled together into an amorphous blob of a beer.  both the excessive hop bitterness and high roast cloud the beer, but thats really how brewers have defined the style.  so thats my comment on Black IPA up to the moment.  Id have to support the positive ratings here and say this is probably one of the better ones that Ive tried, and best available on the market where I am.  hops and roast create a strong green roasted coffee bean smell and flavor.  its not excessively sweet and the malt has firm texture and seems well-suited for the bitterness and level of sugar.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

3964,"2012-04-28",4.3,"A: Growler shared with BA JackCrow courtesy of BA rhertan. Thanks R dogg. Poured a deep, deep brown with good carbonation, lightly sluggish pour leaving a nice tan cap, loads of lacing left on the glass after five minutes

S: Very nice. Loads of rye bread with some pepper, some spice. Nice orange zest, floral notes are dominant on the nose with some oine needles

T: Immediate rye pepperness and spice upfront. The hops provide a nice citrus burst with a light pine and floral burst but the hop bitterness is very present on this beer. It comes right after I taste the citrus leading to me believe it is the hops versus some overly toasted black malt. I pick up some roasted notes along with some cocoa, light coffee. This beer is extremely dry which I like. I am so sick of oily hop bombs. Some wheat peaks in from time to time as does light bread, probably from the rye.

M: Big body, booze is present but well hidden, loads of flavor on the palate, dry and clean

O: Damn outstanding! I usually avoid Rye IPAs because they can easily become messy and muddled. Not this beer. FW never fails. A pure treat to drink","Tacoma, USA","BARLEYWINEO"
3964,"2012-04-28",3.9,"Poured this beer into a goblet glass. Thick tan head on a jet black, opaque beer. The aroma is of hops, citrus, piney, and somewhat spicy (rye?). The flavor is complex for an IPA. The zing and earthy spice I'm assuming is coming from a healthy proportion of rye and alcohol. Alcohol is high but not hot or solvent-like. Hop favors ride shotgun with rye in the drivers seat. The finish leaves the mouth watering for more.

3964,"2012-04-25",4.3,"22oz bomber from Olive Tree Market in OB, $5.99--not seeing a bottled on date, strangely.  Deep garnet when held up to light, otherwise black bodied with a 1/2 finger tan head, pretty good retention.  Big tropical fruit nose with some citrus and moderate rye with some toasted malt.  Flavor follows suit with tropical hops dominating again with some light sweet rye and toasted malt behind.  Light grassy hops toward the finish.  The finish is dry, alcohol is ridiculously well masked, and bitterness peaked at a 4-5--only once I stuck my tongue out and moved/twisted it around at the back corners. Medium full smooth body with a light to moderate creamy carbonation. I generally dont like black IPAs, but this has none of the roasty burnt astringency that the style is laden with. It also doesnt suffer the pitfall of being too bitter without balance and/or the flavor and aroma hops to back it up. This beer is fantastic, and priced right.

The nose was roasted malts with a lot of obvious rye, and a bit of citrus.  Medium to full in body, the mouthfeel is smooth and creamy.
