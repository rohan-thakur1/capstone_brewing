Mouthfeel features decent body, good fizz, and a hoppy and malty finish. A third party candidate? Its a temptation in this election - I cant stand either major party candidate.

852,"2016-07-24",3.6,"Drank from a glass, poured from a bomber bottle, 
this beer was a clear orange-gold in the glass with some yellow hues, and gave a one to two finger, creamy, white cover that receded to a half finger of bubbles, it left nice spots and fingers of lacing on the glass that slowly rolled off

the aromas where floral, herb and citrus fruit (faint peach & melon) hops, the hops had a touch of earth to them, light malt and bread notes, 
some bread and sugar sweetness, 

it had flavors of spice and grapefruit citrus hops, light malt and bread flavor with a bread sweetness, 
the hops gave a spice bitterness that hung around on the tongue a bit, 

the mouth feel was about medium, it was creamy and had soft to average carbonation, 

the nose had nice hops with light malt and bread, 
flavor was pretty much the same, the alcohol was hidden in this drink.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and moderate pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of peach, apricot, pear, white grape, grapefruit, lemon zest, orange peel, pepper, pine, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine/citrus peel and herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of peach, apricot, pear, white grape, grapefruit, lemon/orange peel, pepper, pine, cracker, bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and zero astringent hop flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness as well. Very clean on lager flavors with zero yeast notes present. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately sticky/resinous, and fairly grainy/bready balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a very nice imperial Pilsner style. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/fruity/earthy hops and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
