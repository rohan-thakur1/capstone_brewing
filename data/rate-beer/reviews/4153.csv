4153,"2017-04-29",4.2,"From notes. Enjoyed at Dougs house for the Whale Tasting and Poker Night, almost 18 months in planning. 375 mL bottle. The pour is a darker copper amber color with a couple bubbles of what could be a head and no lace. The aroma has a ton of cinnamon. There is a lot going on, which is a little surprising. Its a light banana bread that moves through to almost a cinnamon French toast. Its really good, and complex. The maple kind of fades out toward the back end, but I like it. The flavor is much of the same. There is the strong cinnamon bomb up front before the banana bread comes rolling through and then the light honey and maple come through. I just love it. Its complex and delicious. The mouth feel is thick and syrupy with a viscosity that lingers and a lingering banana and cinnamon on the back end. Surprisingly good.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
4153,"2016-11-15",2.5,"Bottle, shared with BBGTC. Clear golden body. Nose is banana, almond essence, vanilla, caramel, rice porridge and hints of honey and some harsh medicinal notes. Taste is vanilla, caramel, rice porridge and hints of biscuits, honey, alcohol and bitter medicinal notes. Seems over-aged, as this one is 7+ years old. Over the top I guess, would be interesting to compare against a fresh bottle.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"
4153,"2015-10-15",4.1,"Poured a golden amber color with aromas of bourbon, and french toadt. Flavors match the aromas with bourbon, light banana, french toast really great, love this stuff.","Florida, USA","burg326"
4153,"2015-09-26",4.6,"375 bottle. Pours golden and still. Aroma is inviting with notes of banana, cinnamon, maple and vanilla. Taste is decadent cinnamon french toast accompanied by banana, cinnamon, bourbon, vanilla, and maple sweetness. Medium bodied, no alcohol heat. Its essentially the original (sweet) bourbon banana french toast mead, but as a bochet (more caramelized and toasted honey base).
It had been awhile since Kuhnhenn released a sweet mead and one of this caliber!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","sarro"

Taste follows the nose, very sweet and lots of caramel and cinnamon with a light dough note. Full bodied rich as creamy, not much alcohol at all.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"
4153,"2015-04-25",3.9,"Bottle via trade. Deep reddish amber pour with no head. Strong cinnamon. Buttery burnt toast. A bit boozy. Nutmeg and allspice. Some vanilla and general bourbon character. Inviting, sweet stuff. Taste is similar. Light burnt orange peel and cinnamon .Caramel. Honey. Plenty of boozy bourbon. Vanilla sundae. Nicely integrated. Relatively balanced for what it is. Full and viscous. Thick. Nice stuff.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
4153,"2015-03-29",4.2,"37.5cl bottle sample obtained via tarde with Sarro, shared @ lucha libre night comes to LeRoeulx. 
De couleur ambrée sur un filament huileux au verre.
Arôme donne de belles notes mielleuses avec cette impression de cake à la banane agrémenté par des notes de vanille et Bourbon plus un résiduel rétro-nasal dépices.
Palais est tout autant épais, mielleux avec un impressionnant profil de muscade et cannelle. Retrouve un généreux côté Bourbon qui perdure en bouche et cela malgré les 14% qui au final ne sont pas surfaits. Le tout est doux, surtout en y incluant la banane, et légèrement épicé avec un rappel de dessert.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
4153,"2015-03-07",4.3,"Pour out of bottle at the brewery, clear golden pour, still pour. Aroma is big caramelized sugars, bourbon, honey, floral notes into a bit of slight orange, nice spicy note with cinnamon, some maple in there as well. Taste was rich caramel, burnt sugars, honey, some cinnamon into some banana, slight floral notes into more sweet vanilla, maple syrup, finishing sweet, slight booze. Very, very nice.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
4153,"2014-12-21",4.4,"375ml bottle. Poured an amber color with no head. Fruity, bananas, spices, ... mmm, french toast.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
4153,"2014-12-13",4.3,"Bottle from Kuhnhenn. Pour is deep copper with a very small white head that fades quickly into lacing. Aroma is intense with notes of vanilla beans, honey, cinnamon, maple syrup, and booze. Flavor is a bit more subtle with much more booze/heat coming through - added notes of banana and dark grain. Would be perfect if it was a bit less hot.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Dfonorow"
4153,"2014-10-02",3.7,"Bottle shared at tasting, thanks cparles! Still burnt copper brown pour. Aroma of intense buttery bread, cinnamon, banana, smells exactly like the name suggests, tons of toasted aromas, maillard aromas. Taste is sweet, more mead-like, not as special as the aroma, I get much more bourbon and honey here. Palate is thin and very sweet. Good stuff.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
4153,"2014-09-30",3.9,"Bottle (375 ml). Shared by cparles, thanks Chris! Almost clear copper with no head. Aroma is really of French Toast (vanilla, cinnammon, nutmeg, bread, eggs) with banana, brown sugar and alcohol. Taste is boozier than aroma with French toast again, banana, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, honeyed sweetnesss, brown sugar and maple syrup. Medium bodied. Almost thin/watery at times though. The aroma is really enticing, but its very hard to drink due to the sweetness and booziness. Really nice to try!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
4153,"2014-09-30",3.9,"Thanks CP for sharing this one! Enjoyed 4 ways @ cellar temp or around there in stemware.

A - Still (obviously) with a very burnt orange and gold

S - This smells incredible. Nose is cinnamon dolce with with creamy lactose, insanely amazing. like french toast on buttery bread. my god I feel so fat. 

T - well.as the name suggests this is a cinnamon brown sugar, loads of doughy sourdough, a rye spice is in here, almost too much herbal spice. a lot of booziness that maybe fades with time? 

M - Very thin with a huge sweetness.

O - Incredible mead but almost too extreme for this youngling who doesnt know mead yet.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
4153,"2014-09-21",4.4,"Big thanks to dak for the share. The 37.5 wide mouth thick green glass bottle pours with a clear deep copper body that has auburn hues and offers up some nice legginess. The aroma is nice and big with sweet intense honey and vanilla giving way to banana and burnt sugar goodness. To the end of the draw it gets into graham cracker topped with maple syrup. The taste is smooth silky sweet smoothness with various burnt sugars, smooth soft honey sweetness and some sweet and spicy maple syrup. At the edges of these sweet notes is a pleasing vanilla sensation. Wow! Great sipper with plenty going on and pleasing balance.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4153,"2014-09-20",4.1,"Smells like bananas foster and heavy cinnamon. Taste is super sweet cinnamon, maple, and alcohol. French toast appears a bit in aftertaste along with the rest of the flavors, but not as much as previous French Toast batches. There is a bit too much booziness/heat in this one.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
4153,"2014-09-19",4.5,"Nice clear, light amber pour. Delicious. It reminds me a lot of bananas foster. Pretty well balanced, maybe a tad boozy. But this is a sweet, dessert like sipper. Nice stuff.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
4153,"2014-08-17",4.6,"Thanks to Jeff for the share. This one lives up to the hype. Smells and tastes like French toast with bananas. No boozines, sweetness balanced with a nice subtle cinimon backer. Get you some!","Long Lake, Illinois, USA","JoePeesie"
