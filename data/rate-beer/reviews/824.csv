824,"2016-02-09",3.5,"650ml bottle from LCBO, gift from wife. Aroma: strong caramel / pils malt, herbal with spices. Of course lots of fresh wheats too. App: hazy pale with green tint, huge white head with good retention and great lacing. Taste and palate: medium body, crisp, light to medium sweetness, light bitter finish. Overall: not a big fan of Pilsners but this is well done. Maybe a bit too sweet. Also thought the aroma was a tad too much, too strong but I prefer that over weak aroma.","St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Stoned99"
824,"2015-12-31",3.7,"750 ml bottle. Pours a veiled pale brownish orange with a thick, resilient white head. Aroma is grapefruit, lemon, lime, pils malt. Flavor is grapefruit, lemon, lime, pils malt, very fruity. Finish is oldish, old cereal and lemon. Medium body, soft mouthfeel and average carbonation.","Quebec City, Quebec, CANADA","VT"
824,"2015-11-22",3.9,"Bottle from the brewery. Bright golden body that is perfectly clear on the first pour from the bottle, and very slightly hazed on the second. Nice white cap of foam on both, though. Big aroma of honey-on-toast and sugar cookie malt, balanced by orange blossom and lemon zest hop notes. Flavour follows - big and balanced, with sweet orange and honey in the front, and orange peel & woody herbs in the finish. Even at 6 months old, this tastes bright and fresh, with very little evidence of the somewhat high ABV. Well done!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
824,"2015-10-17",3.7,"Bouteille de 650ml. Une robe dorée passablement foncée avec une belle mousse blanche. Un nez de malt blond, de sucre, de houblon noble. Une bouche sucrée, ronde, longue et chaleureuse. Une finale sur le sucre mais pas trop et sur les houblons nobles.","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","rodenbach99"
824,"2015-10-04",3.4,"Hazy gold, creamy white head, grainy malt aroma with some booze and some spicy hops. Sent honey malt flavor, some boozy warmth and some spicy hops. Medium body a little syrupy, medium carbonation.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","codfishh"
824,"2015-08-13",4.1,"Bottle - puts a hazed light gold lager in the flute with a massive bone white, tight pored cap. Lovely pungent aromas of bready-biscuit malts and green saaz cones. Big, big Pilsner with a heavy body and bright hopping slides right down the hatch like greased silk. This the most decent double Pils I have tasted from Ontario brewers - great stuff, wish it was available all year.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"
824,"2015-08-11",3.3,"It pours gold with brown highlights; the head is off white and foamy. The aroma has notes of: orange zest, cereal, pine, pears. The taste is medium bitter; there are notes of: lemon zest, pepper, alcohol, tropical fruit, and cereal. The palate is medium bodied with light carbonation and a medium finish. Overall, its one of the better black oaks products.","Ontario, CANADA","chris__hartley"
824,"2015-08-07",3.4,"Bottle from LCBO. Resiny aroma with a little fruit and ""lager"". Taste is well balanced; honey, citrus, resin, pine, lagery finish.","Waterloo, Ontario, CANADA","kevinsenn"
824,"2015-08-02",3.2,"3-month old bottle on clearance at the LCBO. Nose is fruity, grapes, berries, sweet bread, some peppery hops. Taste is rather bland. Tastes like a malty pilsner, bitter and boozy finish. Not too impressed.","Ontario, CANADA","deepeary"
824,"2015-07-28",3.7,"A pleasant malt and citrus nose, frothy white head and a light golden body. This is a fresh tasting and refreshing imperial. The taste profile features citrus, orange and floral accents. Bready malts, a touch of pepper with a hint of honey round out a very tasty summer beer. A little light on some pilsner characteristics, but tasty and well made nonetheless.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Gluepot"

824,"2015-07-17",3.8,"650 ml bottle from the LCBO.
Appearance: Pours a clear amber colour with over a finger of white head. Retention is short and lacing is minimal. 
Aroma:
Malt, yeast, appricot, hint of hops.
Flavours:
Hops, yeast, some pine and appricot.
Mouthfeel:
Average carbonation with a crisp finish. 
Overall: This one starts off smelling like your typical Pilsner but then hits you with hops and pine flavours as you take your first gulp. Tasting this blind, I would swear it was an IPA. Lots of hops going on here and it has a really nice finish.","Ontario, CANADA","HopsandBolts"

824,"2015-07-11",3.2,"Blonde with a little orange sitting below a creamy white head. Mild hay nose with grass, touch of resin hops, a little grass. Mild taste of sweet cerial malt, bittering hops, thoughts of tangerines. Not mind blowing just alright.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Helsdon"
824,"2015-07-10",3.8,"A lightly filtered gold body under a big pillowy white head that settles down fairly quickly.
I was struck by the bitter citrus grapefruit aromas on the pour. Surprising. Bready malts follow quickly on its heels.
A nice medium body, with some creaminess followed by a crisp tingle on the tongue.
Tastes are similar to aromas, with some grassiness added to the mix. Well disguised alcohol content given the elevated abv. This is a real beer drinkers beer. Tasty stuff.","","Randy4Beer"

824,"2015-06-25",3.8,"Liquide doré presque limpide, avec une mousse très mince, et une texture dans les mêmes tons. Nez floral, des roses et du bonbon, avec un peu de caramel. Bouche franchement amère et sucrée, mais en même temps à haute buvabilité, et ce, malgré lalcool. Tout le reste (puissance des saveurs, carbonatation, utilisation des houblons, etc.) est parfaitement à point. On est un peu déçu de la timide tête de mousse, mais sinon elle est redoutable sur tous les plans.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","lesifflebiere"
824,"2015-06-23",3.5,"Bottle from the LCBO. Clear medium gold with a generous off white head that leaves spotty lace. Nose is bready malt with some floral and honey notes. Light sweet honey and fruit start with an unexpected medium light bitterness with some spice in the finish. Medium creamy mouth with soft carbonation. Not being a Pilsener fan I was pleasantly surprised.","Newmarket, Ontario, CANADA","jksipa"
824,"2015-06-21",3.3,"Tap at cest what? 
Clear golden pour, medium white head. Aroma is grassy, but quite sweet, with a solid pale malt base, with some alcohol in the background. Mouth feel is full, and the carb is very soft. Finish is more bitter than i expected, and there is a big amount of sweetness that the grassy hops cant see to cut through.","Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, CANADA","robinvboyer"
824,"2015-06-19",3.4,"Where and how:  pint at Bar Volo 
Aroma straight clean malty feel, mild notes of alcohol, tad floral aromatic hop on side.
 Appearance : 
Top: medium plus size white cap.
Base: clear deep gold.
Palate :  medium full bodied, medium carbonation.
Taste: interesting variation of Mocne. Slightly different hop profile yet with solid malt bottom. I like it. 
 other notes  I am glad to see more of modern Mocne variations around.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"
824,"2015-06-12",3.3,"In Brew Box. Not much of an aroma. Faint banana and lemon. Pale cloudy yellow with white head that lingered. Thin palate, but it is a pilsner. Not bad, but not my favourite style of beer.","","crazy_cat_lady"
824,"2015-06-09",3.6,"Pale golden pour. The aroma is lightly spicy and a little bit grainy.
Pilsner malt and a bit of light noble/floral hoppiness on the back of
the palate. Fairly crisp palate, especially considerin the ABV. Id
like a few more late hops but Im quibbling - this is frankly one of
the better versions of this style that Ive had.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
824,"2015-06-07",3.6,"Bottle - 650ml. Beautiful hazy, golden body with average carbonation and a thick white foamy head. Fresh hoppy aroma with flowery, fruity, grainy, herbal, and honeyish hints. Alcohol is discreet. Its sharp hoppy taste carries malty, coriander, citrusy, and piney notes. Ends with a long bittersweet finish. Feels like a hybrid Imperial Pilsner - Belgian Ale - American IPA beer. Interesting.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
824,"2015-06-06",3.7,"Pours a clean golden colour with a slight orange hue. Big warm cap, frothy, long lasting and with wavy foam lacing. Fruity aromas with some pils hops of fresh mild grass and hints of Belgian Ale yeast. The taste is more where the pils hops shine. Nice grassy zest in the finish. Alcohol very well-hidden. Decent fruity malt. Becomes hazy at last pour. Not exactly what I expected. Just better. A nice limited release.","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"
824,"2015-06-05",3.6,"On tap. Hazy golden amber colour with frothy head. Lagered and a bit of soap with carbonation that accentuates the saaz hops. Medium bodied fairly hoppy flavour and medium length. Better than expected.","Canadiana, Ontario, CANADA","Bendrixian"
824,"2015-06-04",3.6,"Bottle: Poured a light hazy beige color ale pilsner with a nice pure white foamy head with good retention and great lacing. Aroma of light cereal notes with light dry green hops notes. Taste is a mix between some light cereal notes with a dry light hoppy finish. Body is about average with good carbonation and no apparent alcohol. A bit short on character overall but I enjoyed the way the residuals sugar was well balanced.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
824,"2015-05-27",4.0,"A spicy aroma gives way to a creamy texture, with tropical fruit, citrus, crackery malts and pepper. Bright and zesty AND smooth - its a real nice combination. Balanced and well carbonated.","OSHAWA, Ontario, CANADA","GlennHendry"
824,"2015-05-24",3.5,"Its interesting reading the fairly disparate reviews below. My impression is sort of a combination of those below...
Pour is a surprisingly clear dark gold with a two-finger creamy white cap that lingers (fuckin lingerers....). 
Nose is....pleasant but weird. Sweet-smelling bready, fruity malt, grassy hops, faint lemon/lime (Wakatu?). Taste is a sweet bready malt with an ambiguous bitter kick. Its fruity, slightly sugary, with a (barely noticeable) slightly unpleasant metal tang, light peppery tingle, noticeable-but-not-overwhelming alcohol. Its tasty, and it has very clear, discernible pilsener elements, but Im not quite sure what Im drinking here. Its like a jacked up pils, as it should be, but Id like some better hop character, instead of the ambiguous (and not unpleasant) bitterness that lingers on my palate (....must be my word of the day). Ratebeers description of an Imperial Pils calls it a ""catch-all"" category for ""strong, sometimes hoppy lagers..."". This definitely fits that bill.","Quebec, CANADA","HippyHop"
824,"2015-05-23",3.0,"2015-05-22. Crisp yellow body with a small white head. 3+ Aroma is oddly fruity - almost grape juice like at first, followed by strong alcohol presence. Flavour is similar, dry and alcoholic with whispers of the grape like fruit. Pretty rough and boozy. Average bodied palate, good carbonation. A decent take on a style that I dont particularly care for. On tap at Cest What, Toronto.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
824,"2015-05-16",3.4,"650 ml bottle from LCBO. Pours a slightly cloudy bright golden colour with moderate sized lasting white head. Aroma is bready malt, floral hops, a little fruitiness and a bit of spiciness. Flavour is biscuit, flowers, fruit and a touch of pepper. Lively carbonation. Solid.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Spab"
824,"2015-05-10",3.5,"600 mL bottle. Clear golden pour, medium foaming head, good retention. Citrus aroma, lots of hops. Taste is the same hop dominate as the nose. Fairly high level of carbonation. Enjoyed it.","Red Deer, Alberta, CANADA","RhetoricalAns"
824,"2015-05-09",3.3,"Bottle from LCBO. Not so imperial pils, I expect more hops for that. Just a very good understated drinkable beer with decent hops.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
824,"2015-05-09",3.5,"Picked this bottle up at an LCBO in the wastelands north of Toronto after hiking the Oak Ridges Moraine trail & opened a little too early for my liking (not quite enough time to chill) back home on my patio minutes before firing up the BBQ on this fanatic spring day. Pretty pour: carbonation is highly perked, lots of bubbles rising to the pure white cap on top. My first imperial pilsner has me wondering. Starts off slightly slightly bitter, stumbles into a pleasing dryness in the middle & finishes with that absorbic acid style flush that us pils junkies crave. The hops & pumped up abv that the style offers is both a blessing (who doesnt want more hops & booze?) & a curse (I just really enjoy a well put together Czech-style pilsner & am not sure this ramped version of the style pays off). But this is neither here nor there. Good brew.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Freaky_tiki"
824,"2015-05-05",3.3,"Bomber from LCBO served cool in a tulip glass. Hazy deep golden with a fluffy white head. Citrus and grapefruit hops, a bit peppery, tropical fruits, faint sulphur, light biscuit malt support, lightly perfumed/floral, nice. Medium+ body, fairly full carbonation. Quite fruity, a bit resinous/dank, a bit peppery and spicy, alcohol is evident, not quite as friendly as the aroma; dry with decent bitterness and a peppery, somewhat fruity finish. An interesting product.","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"
824,"2015-04-28",3.2,"Draught at Wvrst, Toronto. Hazy, golden body with medium white head. Aroma isnt that strong, some vanilla. The taste is quite good, way smoother than a strong lager but the finish is very hoppy. Quite a good one!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Tranquillity"
