2815,"2017-03-28",4.3,"Draught at Akkurat, Stockholm, Sweden. Clear golden, large white head. Bready malt, herbal hops, and that particular elusive Gänstaller house aroma. Medium bodied, medium carbonation. Dry, medium bitterness. Excellent.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","ekstedt"
2815,"2016-12-29",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2016 Draught at Akkurat, 11/28/16.Massive, massive amount of thick, incredibly well-retained, white head tops a lime-tinted, brass-gold body with a surprising amount of haze for a ""filtered"" product. Probably not filtered and probably the zwickel pils, but its listed as the pils on their board. Anyhow, not too important.The nose is full of strong floral notes; fresh and botanical, with black pepper and tons of well-attenuated honey. Light lavender, even. Nelson who tried it remarked it was too soapy in the nose and while I hear that a lot, I never really get it. Perhaps thats just a low perception of alkaloids for my palate? No idea. Anyways, I loved it and despite the haze, it seemed clean. No yeastiness or flaws.In the mouth its very carbonated, malty and rich but decidedly well-attenuated with strong minerality on the end (sourdough and copper!). Hugely floral, with zesty lemon and black pepper-like hop notes, as well. Bitterness is pleasing and perhaps a bit strong, making it a bit much for its sessionable strength, but its not resinous or sour and its certainly delightful when youre only having one glass of it.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

As with most of Andys works of art, there is no way to adequately describe this in words. Along with Ocator, Kellerbier, and Smoked Zoigl, these things literally -- *literally* -- bring tears to my eyes. I cannot say that about any other brewer in the world. Andreas Gaenstaller has no peers. Period.  Best pilsner on Earth?  With 99.9% certainty.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

2815,"2013-05-31",5.0,"UPDATED: AUG 30, 2015 Simply put: the cleanest, purest and most vibrant expression of pilsner malt  and spalt and hallertauer hops that exists in the world.  Nobody else even comes close.  Andys work is on an entirely different level!   

Minerallic calcium carbonate excitement.
Juicy floral lemon hop aroma.
Pure ecstasy of pilsner malt: warm, aromatic baked cracker richness.
Unbelievably clean.
Smacking, quenching acidity, perfectly matched for body, carbonation and sweetness.

Unequivocal perfection in beer, a work of art and a masterpiece, made by the best brewer in the world.  Literally flawless. Malt is unbelievably soft, carbonation and serving temperature spot on, and the texture is what KILLS... malt has never been expressed with such richness, and hops with such authenticity. Even at room temperature it still exudes perfection.  I had previously given this beer a 3.5 at Akkurat, and it is a fragile beer that doesnt travel well.  But here is a keg brought by Andy from the brewery to the Zoiglstube for our visit, and what he puts in front of us is one of the most beautiful presentations of beer in the world. So now its a 5.0.  For anyone who loves lagers made without compromise, they owe themselves a visit to Franconia to track down Andys super lagers: Kellerbier, Zoigl, Smoked Zoigl, his rich and malty dunkles lagers, and his strong bocks, both traditional and experimental. This is something special, a filter version of Zwickelpils that was originally server only at Akkurat, and its incredble that in Oberfranken, the land of world-class unfiltered lagers, this filtered Pilsner may be the pinnacle of brewery quality.  Its the only beer that Andy filters, and doing so allows the Pilsner malt and German noble hops to shine like they never have before. 
Words can not do it justice. This beer transcends life. There is beauty here that Ive never seen before in beer.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
