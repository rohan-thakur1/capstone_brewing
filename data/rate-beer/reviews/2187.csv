2187,"2014-09-23",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 9-12-13-

 Poured from 500 ml bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a hazy amber color with a huge billowy amber tinted head. The head has great retention fading slowly over time to leave some streaky lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is heaviest of some roasted malt and a bit of a biscuit aroma. Some smells of a slightly sour nature as well as some caramel, citrus and a bit of spice round out the aroma nicely.

 Taste  The tastes begins with a smooth sweeter caramel and lightly toasted malt flavor. As the flavor moves forward a biscuit and cracker taste as well as some graininess comes to the tongue. The sweetness grows bit stronger to the end, as some lighter flavors of dark fruits and a bit of citrus comes to the tongue. While it sweetens and grows a bit more malty, a light herbal flavor as well as a bit of spice join the flavors at the end, to leave a rather balanced malty and sweet flavor on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the creamier side with a carbonation level that is just below average to average. The creamy body is rather nice for the mix of sweeter and malty taste with just enough carbonation to keep it on the easy drinking side.

 Overall  A quite nice and tasty Oktoberfest with a great blend of sweet, malty, roast, and some spice. A job well done.","","Darkmagus82"

The sweet malt flavors are there, but not to the extent that they are overpowering.

Aroma: It has a clean, malty aroma, caramel, bread, and notes of vegetables

Flavor: The flavor has a clean, crisp maltiness, caramel and bready flavors similar to the nose

Overall Impression: 
Alright, Kramer, ticking this one just for you buddy!  Not a bad beer at all, but still not significantly better then anything else in this style for me to really have a strong feeling about it.  I wanted to really like it, I did.  However, it is really just solid, highly drinkable, but just unexciting...and you could really describe my entire opinion on this style that way.

We all know what Ayinger can do with the malts. This beer has got the usual and quite heavy malt profile. It reminds me of dark marzipan. This beer is however quite hoppy at the same time.

2187,"2012-01-03",3.5,"My Bottom Line :  
Honeyed and toasted cereals reign within this Festbiers rich yet quaffable mouthfeel, building a textbook example of this type of lager.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam floats atop the pale amber shine.
-The finish is a tad shallow for my tastes (mostly sweetness and shy on the spicy hop bitterness). 
-Malts also develop bread-like flavors.
-This is as pleasant (and linear) as most Oktoberfests Ive had from Bavaria. Just not a huge fan of this type of lager (too sweet and predictable).

2187,"2011-10-31",3.6,"I poured a 500ml bottle into an Oktoberfest mug.Appearance: Attractive shade of orange/copper. Virtually no carbonation visible. Forms a large, white, sudsy head which laces and retains fairly well.Smell: Very generic lager aroma with light indication of sourness (nothing in the realm of Heineken, just a little off). Slightly sweet, a faint floral note but not very pungent overall.Taste: Its not just big deal beers that have hype or a reputation to live up to, sometimes something fairly innocuous can precede itself as in the case of Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen. Ive heard this is the best Oktoberfest beer from Germany so I definitely wanted to try it. But after the first swig, I failed to see what was so impressive about it.The initial taste is a light confectionary sweetness right away. Toffee and lollipop flavors hit and leave a lingering sweet aftertaste on the tip of the tongue and lips. It then gives way to a very generic, but inoffensive, amber lager palate. Theres sharp bitterness through the middle, accompanied by dry biscuity malt flavors. The finish is very mild leaving an almost completely clean aftertaste. Nothing about the palate here particularly impresses me, but nothing turns me off, either. Its better than most German lagers I can recall, but wasnt the syrup bomb I was expecting it to be. Mouthfeel: Thin, tepid, wet, cold, clean.Drinkability: Mild palates and thin, clean mouthfeels almost always make for highly drinkable beers and Ayinger Oktober Fest-Märzen is no exception. The thin, tepid texture makes it go down very smooth and the body feels much lighter than its 5.8% ABV would seem to indicate.

The head fades quickly to a small remnant and leaves minimal lace. The nose has aromas of grain, caramel malts, pear, banana and flowers. The flavour is somewhat sweet throughout, with notes of honey, toasted malts and fruit. There is a hint of floral hops, but malts remain dominant. The finish is moderate in length and quite grainy. On the palate, it is light-medium in body with a smooth, watery texture and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice Märzenbier with big fruity notes and a soft malty character.

2187,"2011-02-20",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2012 Ayinger is one of the few Germans that you cant get in the 12 oz variety of bottle. The cap is gimmicky and one of the coolest ones I have come across. No sign of freshness date, but I am pretty sure it is fresh.

Pours the lighter Oktoberfest style, the festival lager style, with a mix of amber and gold body. Nice 4 finger white head.

The malts smell juicy and roasted. The hops are earthy with a hint of spice, a nice scent to this one.

The mouthfeel is pretty full, a lot of sweetness, mostly malt, one of the heartier tasting Oktoberbests. The hop bitterness sneaks in slighlty at the end but it is well-balanced.

Overall a solid Oktoberfest beer, would like to have it by the 12 oz bottle though rather than the larger bottle. It is a well balanced entry into the field and may be what you want to try first if your pondering on which one to choose.

The next thing I notice is the aroma, which I can smell from where Im sitting  my glass is about an arms length away.  Next we have the head, which is rocky, with inconsistent large and small bubbles.  As it fades, the head retention is strange.  It looks like fat suspended in broth  lets hope it doesnt taste like that.  Aroma reminds me a little bit of a farm, kind of like damp straw.  Damp leaves maybe.  Color is amber moving to gold, a little bit darker than a pumpkin.  Taste is light, with a slightly salt water mineral finish.  Mouthfeel isnt sticky, more along the lines of creamy.  Lager yeast is the name of the game here, as it dominates everything, from the nose of the beer into the first taste.  I expected this to have more malt characteristics, honestly, and they are there, to be sure, though not as sweet as I would like.

Ayinger Oktober Fest Marzen is a wonderfully crisp and sweet brew suitable for drinking by itself or with food. Before eating, I found it to be clean, light, and refreshing. It could be a wonderful alternative to watered-down light beers on a hot summer day.

It was great beer for the low price of $2.49 here in Texas!

2187,"2009-10-23",4.5,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 500ml bottle into a big mug. There appears to be no freshness date on the label. 

Appearance: It has a rich deep golden color with very good clarity and some nice carbonation flowing up to the head. The head has a creamy off white color and rises up tall in the glass before slowly settling down to a nice foamy cap.

Smell: In the nose there are some sweet bready and light toasted notes with light grain and some floral/spicy hops.

Taste/Palate: The flavor has a very enjoyable malty character. There is mild sweetness, bready and light toasted grain notes, pie crust and very light caramel notes. This is balanced by some mild bitterness and notes of spicy/floral hops. The hops turn more leafy and mineral like in the finish which is crisp and refreshing. Its body has a solid medium to full feel with well balanced carbonation.

Notes: This is a very well made Oktoberfest. To me its like a Munich Helles Lager but a little deeper in color, richer and fuller in flavor and body with the same wonderful drinkability.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

Taste has less of the dirty oily element of the nose, but is still present along with sweetish honey and straw malt and the soft floral. Palate is medium, low carb but still easy drinking.

Smells of caramel sweetness and yeast, with a nice crisp white grape twist.  The flavor is simple and great, with more of that caramel malt sweetness and the earthy goodness of the yeast and a bit of spice.  White wine dryness and a slightly bitter finish.

Its very pleasant, even if that description makes it sound oversweet.  Its a light but rich malty character that transmits to the flavor quite well.  The beer is has a delicate and complex malt character that has fruit and caramel notes.  The Germans really know how to tease out delicate malt flavors.

2187,"2009-08-04",3.7,"A brilliant orange with faintly darker hues of brown and amber. She is crowned by a soft, creamsicle head which lingers long into her final moments while commemorating our time together with small patches of lace. My first whiff of her nose bursts and crackles with fresh butterscotch candies, white bread crackers, candied fruit, crunchy apples, pears, and oranges. Delicate and subtle, her aromas are woven together in an intricate network of finesse and skill. In the background, toasted malts are drizzled with fresh honey. Her nose is balanced exquisitely, but how will her palate hold up? Clean, and only of medium-weight, she lightly coats my mouth in a soft butterscotch glaze while toasted bread settles into the background. Cinnamon sticks and powdered cinnamon add a dry breath of spice to balance the malty sweetness. As I bite into her crisp peaches and pears, their juices trickle down my throat while their skins add a brisk acidic nip for a playful measure. In the background, further soothing notes of butterscotch and maple linger into her finish while her fruits sit squarely in the middle. Deliciously dry, brisk, and bright, as I enjoy the last of my Ayinger Oktoberfest, I feel an honored witness to living history.


Ayinger never fails to impress me with their constant consistency and quality of beers.

I am looking at it right now. The head is nice. It doesn’t fade away fast. The color/appearance is a light caramel/orange/brown color. This beer is very transparent. Decent looking marzen, but I wish it could be a bit darker. VERY malty. This beer has a very sweet aroma. The beer is still pretty cold and the malt aroma is jumping out at me! This is a very pungent Oktoberfest beer. I can’t get over how malty the aroma is. Smells great! The beer has a nice dry hop flavor. The beer is balanced well with caramel malt flavor. Jeez, this beer has a wonderful hop profile for being as malty as it is. I am very impressed with this balance. I just can’t get over the dry hop flavor at the end. It is great. Not too many brewers are able to achieve this balance in a beer this malty. As the beer warms up, the hops and the malts come out even more. Overall, this is an excellent Oktoberfest beer.

Barely a little spiciness  from the hops. After a swish in the glass as it warms a little there are hops in the nose, and alcohol. Its not too effervecent ( as light and fluffy) because of the full bodiness. The second pour in my glass gave me some flowery hops in my nostrels which quikly fades to big maltiness.

A good tasting beer, a much smoother and creamier body than would be expected from the style, good variety of malt flavors with a nice toffee/caramel, along with a toasted cookie malt, balanced pretty well with a light citrus/floral hop that produces a very good linger with the malt.

[8 / 4 / 8 / 3 / 16 ]Pours caramel/amber with a large foamy off-white head.   Lovely spicy, caramel malt,  and floral hop aroma.  Really smooth barley-wine like caramel malts, warm and honey sweet, the hops really sit nicely behind the malt.  Nice full/medium mouthful and gently carbonated.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

(quite large for a marzen) is a bit limony and sweet and of caramel. also many some notes of nutes and toffee. Mouthfeel is pretty mouthcoating and very sweet. The alcohol content while it is moderate is pretty will hidden and its only appearence is in the aftertaste which has a bit of an acidic bite. Great marzen nonetheless. I might add this beer probably is even better when fresh.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","ilovedarkbeer"
2187,"2008-02-16",3.8,"Nice deep amber coloured body with a frothy off-white head and a orange tint that makes this beer look exactly like the style should. Aroma of deep caramel malt, toffee, light nutmeg and cinnamon with some faint yeast qualities. A great looking and smelling beer! Medium-bodied; Sharp maltiness up front fading to a light spiceyness along with some vegetable tastes mixed throughout. Aftertaste shows some of the bitter malt and some light pit fruits. Overall - this one looks and smells great, but the taste and palate are just decent. Overall, a good marzen to drink, especially if you want a German...but dont look here for the one and only beer to drink during the season.

Caramel almost sweet smelling, followed up by biscuits and warm bread. Near the end you can pick up herbal notes as well. Complex and sweet malts on the tongue. More bread-like character that I noticed in the aroma. Well-blended flavor, but complex on every other sip. Smooth and crisp on the palate. As some other people mentioned, its a tad bit watery, but doesnt take away from the face value of the beer. Very drinkable. Pretty sure Ive had this before with my brother.

The aroma had a soft floral dusting over a a toasty caramel base.. some dry leafy accents and faint peppery notes round it out.  The flavor stayed the course with a sweet, toasty caramel core with floral notes, light fruit, and dried leaves providing a mild and complimentary bitterness.

The mouthfeel on this was nice and smooth and the taste was similar...buttery. I was expecting more sweet malty goodness and more spiciness from the maker of Celebrator. Disappointing.","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"
2187,"2007-09-03",4.1,"Pours a clear caramel colour with a dense white head that fades to a small cap. The aroma is sweet roasted malts, ripe fruit, caramel, light peat, honey and a hint of barnyard funk. The flavour is lightly sweet roasted malts and bready malts with yeasty and peppery overtones. The tingly, thin palate and long, mildly bitter and spicy finish make this one very drinkable. To me, this is what an Oktoberfest should be. It is subtle, refined and reminds me of flavours from the autumn harvest.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Drink4Satan"

It just looks like a beer should. On the nose I get spicy hops, sweet malt notes, biscuit dough, grapefruit, lemon zest and floral notes. Fore is lightly astringent, with the hops and bready notes dominating. Back of the tongue brings more malt sweetness into play, as well as the citrus hints. Palate is creamy and medium bodied. Finish is sweet bread dough and hops, medium length and refreshing. Great beer.","Tampa, Florida, USA","Quake1028"

2187,"2006-10-02",3.0,"Appears a hazy, copper toned amber with a small, off-white head that fades into a fizzy collar. Streaks of lacing is left around the glass.
Smell is of malty, sourdough, mild fruit, caramel, raw maple, with a off note that is a bit vegetal.
Taste is of the same aromas. Theres the doughy, caramel infused broccoli again that Im just not digging. What the hell is that? Its like an odd astringency thats in there by accident. The sweet malts seem to be coving up for its inadequacies, nonetheless.
Mouthfeel is crisp, medium bodied, and slightly thin. This was one of the few Oktoberfests we found in the store during our weekend at The Jersey Shore. Even the wife was kind of let down with this, as its one of her favorite styles. Overall, its just sort of unexciting, and ho-hum.

Unfortunately, theres just a hint of that roasted vegetable taste in it, I think.  Goes away as you drink it.  Not the best octoberfest Ive had (as a result of the slight off-flavor, as well as the  flavor not being as full as it could), but definitely one of the best.

Sitson the tongue well, not a ton of body, but good for a Marzen smooth needless to say.  Malt and cereal/bread flavor seeps into the tongue and mouth.   A little bit of spice (maybe peppery?) perhaps coming from the floral hop tastes.  Towards the end, I felt like I was getting bits of toasted malt flavor too.

2187,"2005-09-22",3.8,"A very balanced, tasty beer in a style I dont particularly like. Pours a beautiful copper with a huge head that takes a bit to dissipate. Has that distinctive pilsner yeast smell (that will always remind me of MGD), but there is a fruity scent playing around in there, too, which bodes well. The flavor is mostly slightly sweet malt up front, a pleasing bitterness on the finish, and just a hint of more complex flavors that I cant make out. Im guessing Ayinger makes this beer with the intention people will drink a lot of it at once, like, say, at an Octoberfest party, so the alcohol is low enough that you can drink the whole 500 ml bottle and just feel happy, not wasted. But drink a few pints of this, and you will feel it, which is probably just what the brewers were aiming for. Oh, the high score for the palate is because of how smooth it is, yet the body is very satisfyingly medium thick  (when not ice cold, please drink this beer -- and all good beers -- at ""cellar"" temp).

2187,"2005-07-10",3.5,"(500 ml bottle: $1.99 at Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, CA) Moderately sweet, malty and mildly caramely, with a gentle bitterness.  This is lighter than most American Oktoberfests, and is less flavorful than even some of the other imported German Oktoberfests, but it still has a nice classic German maltiness.  The nose isn’t especially aromatic either, but it’s noticeably malty, just with less richness and character than others I’ve had.  Soft, smooth palate, well carbonated, easy to drink.  Medium golden color seems pretty light for the style, and the moderate cloudiness was a surprise, but then I noticed a fair amount of sediment in the bottom of the bottle.  Whitish head pours to about an inch, and has great staying power, leaving deposits lots of lace on the glass as I drink the beer.  It’s not a great beer, but it’s a nice, simple Oktoberfest that tries to finess its way to your taste buds.  I guess the issue is that when I’m in the mood to drink a German Oktoberfest, I’m looking for a solid maltiness, and this just comes up a bit short.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

The flavor is balanced away from the malty sweetness that many of the style display, but is still very nice.  It is a crisper, dryer flavor, with some hops, but still shows a nice malt.  Its almost like a cross between a German-style Pilsener and a normal Oktoberfest.  The palate is average, with the carbonation being a bit harsh at the outset, but it settles down in a few minutes.  Overall its a nice beer, but I dont like it as well as most of the Oktoberfests out of Munich.

2187,"2005-01-29",3.5,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2005 Not one to fiddle-fart around, I went straight to the top, the standard setter, the big honcho, the head cheese of the Oktoberfesten-Marzen model, from the makers of the worlds top rated Doppelbockenbrau.  My first O-M.  Which presents me with some apprehension: Did I get a good bottle?  Is this really what Oktoberfesten-Marzen bier is supposed to taste like?  I can only go on the basis of what I know.  This does strike me as, well, German in character.  Germans like those malts.  Put some more malts in it and youve got a bock.  Soft and sweet, some sort of fruity sugariness.  I think I must be missing out on something -- maybe its that Im not tasting this in the properly designated month.  For some gawdawful reason, I always associated O-M with the color orange, and now I guess I know why.

Aw, heck with it, Ill cut to the chase: give me some HOPS for crying out loud.  Do ze Germans give us brau other than heavily-malted or lagery ones?  Im trying to think here . . . well, I guess they give us wheaty ones, too.  Damn.  Der Weizendunkelbock mit de Kritik der Reinen Vernunft.  Ja.  Oddervize vee kill ze girl.

One of the better Oktoberfests I have had to date. Mellow light orange appearance, tight, but frothy off white head, thick lacing. Slight aroma of sweet bubblegum and caramel. Flavor has a cotton candy sweetness to it that is quite enticing. Backed up by a strong malty nuttiness as well. Lacks that vegetable flavor that some Oktoberfests seem to dwindle down to in the aftertaste, this one stays strong and sweet to the finish. Mouthfeel and thick and creamy.

Slight caramel and apple aroma.  Yum...candied apples.  Flowery hops and doughy yeast aromas.  Flavor starts mod. sweet / mod. bitter and finishes mod. bitter with no acidity.  A note of honey arrives in the finish.  Light carbonation accompanies a watery body with a light / medium consistancy.  Flavors are pleasant, but too subdued.

2187,"2002-08-24",4.2,"This is the essence of Oktoberfest in a bottle.  It poured a beautiful dark gold, with a wonderful malt nose.  Smoooooooth, with a nice subtle yeast finish.  Ok, its not  Celebrator, but it stands on its own merits as perhaps the finest Fest brew i have tried yet.","Portland, Oregon, USA","AxeMaster221"

2187,"2002-08-09",4.1,"Nice Aroma, a little much on the malty side though. Great lacing and head.
Appearance is dark amber, with some cloudiness. Palate is wonderfully smooth, with a subtle yeast/barley finish.
This is definately one of the better beers ;-).","Mesa, Arizona, USA","Miggl"

2187,"2002-07-24",3.3,"Nice gold color.  You can see fresh hop throught the glass.  It has a nutty flavor in it?  Hope I am right.","White Plans, New York, USA","babycakes"
2187,"2002-07-18",3.6,"A very nice brew.  Somewhat sweet, but not as much as their Maibock.  I would gladly pound a few more of these.  Plenty of malt.  However, its a tad fizzy.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
2187,"2002-06-02",3.2,"Honey-like, medium golden amber color.  Head is definitely there and so is the carbonation.  Malty aroma, certainly some sweetness and caramel.  Flavor is also largely malty (appropriately), with some spiciness, some very apparent caramel tastes, (sticky bun!) and a touch of hops, although these are hardly immediately apparent.  Finish is rather long and malty.  A bit more heavy-duty of a Fest style than Im used to, but thats not a bad thing.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
2187,"2002-05-28",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2005 
Clear copper color with a small off white head that leaves some lacing in my glass. Sweet bready, grainy aromas, light grainy, nutty and caramel flavors, finishes clean and dry. Light to medium bodied with a crisp and carbonated mouthfeel, a well done Oktoberfest, I look forward to this every year.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MaxPower"
2187,"2002-05-28",3.7,"Nice bronze gold color.Fresh malt and hops aroma.  Slightly nutty flavor.  Lacks toasted flavors which I fell are essential to this style - but still a very good beer.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
2187,"2002-05-04",3.1,"Hmmmm....I think I like Paulaner better.  This just seems to light and watery for me.  Nice caramel hint though.  Definately not bad, but not one of my first choices.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","MOboy"
2187,"2002-04-13",4.1,"Nice golden color with a big frothy head that lasts. Rich malty aroma that smells like a beer is supposed to. The taste is slightly hoppy, slightly malty, with a hint of fruitiensess that I normaly am not a big fan of, but works well here. You can taste a little of that 5.8% in the finsih, but its not at all overpowering. Overall a very good beer, I intend to buy it again, and soon.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","ToadMan"
2187,"2002-04-10",4.0,"I never met a Marzen I didnt like.  That said, I had a bottle of this after work.  This brew
pours a hazy honey color with floaties.  The fully lasting large creamy off-white head has
excellent lacing.  The balanced and pleasant nose hints of dark bread, cereal, herbs, spruce,
citrus, earth, pineapple, honey, spices and alcohol.  The moderate balanced sweet then
bitter flavor is not astoundingly complex, but is very nice.  The  medium soft
dry body is on the edge of creaminess, and finishes moderately alcoholic.  I love this
style.  I love this brew.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"

2187,"2002-03-20",3.3,"Very cloudy light amber color with a huge foamy head.  Bottle was sedimented?  Light caramel and toffee notes in the aroma.  Sweet flavor, but restrained a bit, with nice caramelized flavors and some yeastiness.  Smooth and just a little flat.  Light alcohol warming in the finish.  Bottle was of unknown age, possibly detracting from the flavor.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

2187,"2002-02-24",3.2,"Orangish in appearance, the subtle malting becomes more apparent in aroma and flavor as the beer warms.  A bit light-bodied, however, the low roasted malts are pleasant, yet undemanding on the palate.  A very easy to drink offering that I may have underrated on this occassion.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"

2187,"2002-01-04",4.1,"this beer looks like an oktoberfest should.  golden-orange with a creamy, persistent head.  any lacing falls quickly from the side of the glass.  subtle bread in the aroma.  clean grain, with a dry, and slightly sweet finish.  lively mouthfeel, with a metallic tinge.  an ideal oktoberfest, the best ive had yet.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
2187,"2001-12-21",4.1,"Reddish coppery hue with light haze and carbonation. Pour is initially lively resulting in a dense rocky and enduring foam. Nose is toasted malt with a slight cookie aroma, mild grain and pepper. A spritzy mouthfeel is light to medium bodied making for a refreshing drink. Tasting shows more of the biscuity toasted malt, a grainy middle, rounding out with a little sourness and brief hints of dryness. I also picked up a few light metallic notes, and should add that the beer seems to find increased depths of fruitiness with food.
Probably my favorite Oktoberfest brew this year.","California, USA","BeerLimey"
2187,"2001-12-02",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 22, 2012 INCREDIBLE BEER!  Malty and floral nose... Flavor was malty but had this slight floral thing going on too... slight hint of fruit also... One of my favorites!","Wilmar, Arkansas, USA","HarmonKill-a-Brew"

2187,"2001-10-20",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2016 Typical German-lager/malt aroma.  Aroma of olives. Very nice light amber color with tight, active bubbles and frothy head.  Very full but subdued malt flavor and smoothness, typical of the style.  Classy and smooth, and not overwhelmingly malty or sweet.  A very well made beer, but not a favorite style of mine.   
Re-rate: Malty and silky.  Nutty sweet.  Finish is more dry than I remembered.","Rutland, Vermont, USA","canary dog"
2187,"2001-10-16",3.7,"This is a good German interretation of the style.  Medium bodied with a great malty sweetness.  Easily the equal of a Paulaner.","San Diego, California, USA","Kaya161"
2187,"2001-10-16",3.7,"Very good representation of the style. Chewy; would be much better on tap, as the syrupiness overpowers by the last sip of the bottle. Rating is based primarily on taste rather than drinkability.","LaVista, Nebraska, USA","K-V-F-L"
2187,"2001-10-10",3.8,"Big malt presence is evident in the nose along with more subtle fruity aromas.  This translates into a great toasty malt flavor with minimal bitterness,  some grape notes and yeastiness in the background.  Great amber color with huge frothy off-white head that stuck around for almost half the beer.  Perhaps the most impressive aspect of this beer is the full malty palate.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

2187,"2001-08-29",3.5,"Cloudy with a thick head and thick body that appears to stifle the bubbles from rising. Very thick creamy mouthfeel with some nice Marzen maltiness. The citrus twang and yeasty bite was weird and this appeared to be fairly high in ABV. An interesting brew to say the least, with some HefeWeiss qualities. One to try, just not in excess. This brew was a meal in itself.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"

2187,"2001-07-24",3.9,"This is more on par with Celebrator than their Ur-weisse, but still not quite at that level.  Purple grape juice aroma with hint of chocolate.  Reddish-brown hue and consistent head lead to a light, slightly bubbly mouthfeel.  Malty and predominantly flavored by grape, this is a great brew.  A bit rich, not something I could drink all night, this should probably be enjoyed only once every so often.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
2187,"2001-06-13",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 2, 2010 Golden body, with some floral notes above its malty caramel tones. Very sessionable with a hint of sweetness throughout its soft,  light-bodied texture. Ends on a bit of a bitter, metallic note.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"
