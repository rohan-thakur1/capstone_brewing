3765,"2016-04-22",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2016 DATE: April 22, 2016... OCCASION: Cavs up 3-0, Joeys first tee ball game, and a better end to the school day than expected... GLASSWARE: Schneiders Weisen pokal... APPEARANCE: the glass divides into a robust copper body that houses a lazy effervescence and a thick, craggy, resistant white head that pillows nicely... AROMA: fragrant, earthy spiciness suggests hops, though the main aroma is an astringent vapor that says 8.7% up front... banana and clove, yes... PALATE: slick, medium-bodied, vibrant body that leaves a tingling at the throat... the aftertaste lingers, but pleasantly so... TASTE: banana and clove, with the bread and toast of a malt-forward beer... enough fruitiness--apple, plum--to complicate the profile.... slightly acidic and sweet--challenging to nail down, but enjoyable in its weight and strength... OVERALL: another victory for Victory--an autumn glory that rises in the spring, and shows enough complexity to encourage the next sip...

3765,"2016-02-06",4.0,"Pours attractive orange amber with fizzy beige head that lingers for a bit.
When they say harvest fruit, they mean the banana harvest, because thats the premier note of the aroma along with cloves, apples, raisins and alcohol.
Those are all there on the palate, along with honey, apricots and orange fizz. Alcoholic heat and a light body undercut the development, and the 8.7 percent ABV seems under-reported. But there are still a lot of flavors passing through, like a rum cake with sliced fruit.
You might find more nuance in Belgium or Germany, but this is a happy beer.","","Pumpkin87"

3765,"2015-06-05",3.5,"Was skeptical about uploading review based on that this wasnt fresh. Still, well call this one an aged review.
This was poured into a weizen glass.
The appearance was a hazy bronzed orange color with a two finger white foamy head that dissipated within about thirty seconds leaving less than slim messy lacing.
The smell had a sweet dark fruits to gentle spice rolling into each other nicely.
Light sweet bready notes balance nicely.
The taste wraps together the spice with the breadiness, sweet yet gentle clove. Theres no aftertaste but it does have a slight gentle sticky sweet finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sessionable aspect to it. Carbonation seemed okay for the style but may have died a bit too since its an old bottle.
Overall, for a weizenbock that came out last Autumn, I liked it now. Im hoping to see it this coming Autumn as Im sure it will be nice to sip on my deck overlooking a West setting Autumn sun.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3765,"2015-01-09",3.7,"This hazy, caramel liquid comes pouring out of the bottle and apparently does not like the way I am pouring. A huge head ensues, and it is ridiculous to think that I might get any beer out of this. I adjust, the brew is happy, I get beer. The head is amazing.

An overwhelming fragrance of spiced bananas out of the neck as I pour, a very fruit/hay presence. Its almost like eating granola with yogurt and a handful of a syrupy fruit. Quite pleasant and exciting for my olfactory senses! Love the aroma.

The head is still amazing.

The taste is confusing, sour on the back-end and doughy-sweet on the front, but isnt that about right for this style? Dry and lingering on the sides of my tongue, it doesnt leave any real flavor or taste that might throw off the next bottle, but it has so much personality of its own that youd think that was just a ruse. That finish is almost perfect, but does leave that lingering yeast and reminds that this is a wheat beer and those dont just go away.

A good brew, a comfortable drinker, and an enjoyable experience. If I was a big bock drinker, this actually be listed on my go-to list for a cool refreshing accent to a hot summer evening.

3765,"2014-10-06",3.8,"12 oz. bottle, best by Aug 15, 2015. Sent for review by Victory. Yep, all these powerhouse ratings, and they still want a little pub. Im well-disposed toward Victory, anyway. (This should satisfy requirements for Full Disclosure). Foams up a bit as I pour into a smaller wheat glass. Ocher color under a big puffy head. Smell has some carrot cake and even pumpkin pie spice to it, but only from yeast, so it would make a nice fall seasonal. Taste has big German malts, kilned to caramel texture and with plenty of banana and bubble gum weizen esters. Malts hold up the extra alcohol. A bit strong for a ""main course"" beer, but it would be welcome against an onslaught of holiday feasting.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

3765,"2014-09-29",3.8,"Served on tap in a pint glass-
 Appearance  The brew is served a quite hazy copper-orange color with a billowy just off white colored head. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave almost no lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is rather strong of a nice wheat bread aroma, mixed with a good deal of fruits, being a mix of both dark and light varieties. The biggest fruit aromas are that of cherry, banana and plum Along with these aromas comes smells of yeast and spice with the spice being a blend of clove and coriander. A little bit of a grassier and caramel aroma are there as well giving it a rather smooth and sweet wheat bread smell.
 Taste  The taste begins with a good showing of wheat and fruity flavors with some plum and cherry and a little bit of a grainy taste. Right from the start there is a decent showing of a yeasty flavor with it also having taste of spice mixed within. Flavors of banana start out rather light upfront, but grow quite a bit stronger as the taste advances. More fruit flavors join the banana with a bit of a sour lemon and grassy taste joining the taste profile. The lemon actually gets moderately strong toward the end, but is ever balanced by spice flavors of clove and coriander as well as the darker fruit and wheaty flavors mixing with a decent sum of booziness to leave a sweet wheat and warming flavor on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel- The body of the beer is on the slightly chewier side with a carbonation level that is around average. For the mix of darker fruits, banana, spice and yeast with the decent boozy flavor, the feel is great as it provides a nice base for the flavors to be well supported and sensed, but yet has enough carbonation to keep it from any one component of the taste from becoming overwhelming.
 Overall  A fairly nice drinking brew. A decent level of booziness, but all very well balanced out by the wheat, fruit, and yeasty spiced flavors of the beer. Rather tasty.","","Darkmagus82"
3765,"2014-09-26",4.3,"12 ounce bottle into weizen glass, best before 8/19/2015. Pours hazy reddish copper color with a 2-3 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with incredible retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts the whole glass. Dense soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the dense head. Incredible appearance. Aromas of big banana, raisin, plum, cherry, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big banana, raisin, plum, cherry, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, light nuttiness, herbal, pepper, and yeast earthiness. Good amount of earthy yeast spice on the finish; with lingering notes of banana, raisin, plum, cherry, clove, caramel, toast, toffee, brown bread, herbal, pepper, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and robustness of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium-high carbonation and medium bodied; with a very smooth, crisp, and lightly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is an incredible weizenbock!

I drank a few of those some years ago and vaguely remember liking it.  But now that I decide to rate one (late 2010 batch) I find it is totally off.  Bad memory or bad batch?

3765,"2010-12-07",3.2,"12oz bottle from Winooski.
Appearance : Clear shiny amber with tiny head that goes away instantly. No lacing at all.

Aroma : Brown sugar with caramel and some spices. Some cloves. A bit better with the yeast. Nose get some nice yeasty notes but its still mainly spices.

Taste : Some wheat with spices. Light caramel and dark fruits. Finish has some wheat and dark fruits. Some spices too. Palate quite flat, only a light fizzyness. Nice dry finish with nice notes of yeast (on the last pour).

Overall : Im still not sure if my bottle was ok because others ratings refer to sizable heads and lacing and I got none of either. Carbonation is also surprisingly soft. Still its an enjoyable brew but a bit too spicy and not enough yeasty (banana, etc).","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

Spicy Belgian yeast flavors are well in order, with banana and clove leading the pack. What I didnt expect to taste was a sugary sweetness reminiscent of candy apples and oranges.

Picking this one out of the refrigerator and giving it 20 minutes to warm up a bit, I was attracted immediately by its sweet caramel nose, though it wasnt the most beautiful beer (in its style or generally), with a moderately sized, irregular head on a body that is neither rich with yeasty murkiness or tinged with the colors of moonglow.  The flavors were exactly what I wanted this night, however: citric, yeasty, bready, and moderately caramelly, with soft layers of rich fruit and spice.  Decent palate, somewhat lilting and somewhat soothing.  High abv makes it a good end-of-the-week beer.  Delightful and a beer I would drink again.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

M: The body is medium with a lively carbonation that is moderately creamy. A mild warming feel, likely from a rather robust ABV.

Touches of caramel, spice, and a slight tang of citrus.

3765,"2010-04-30",3.3,"I like a spicy beer, but is it possible for a beer to be too spicy? Victory Moonglow Weizenbock makes a case for just that since its a beer thats literally bursting with so much flavor that its a challenge to drink. POUR, COLOR AND AROMAI have never had so much trouble pouring a beer as with Victory Moonglow. When my first bottle poured with an exuberant head I chalked this up to simple pourer error. But when the second bottle, intentionally poured carefully, produced an ever worse head I knew it wasnt me - it was the beer.Now, I like a big head on my beer but when the glass is more head than beer theres a problem. All that gas couldve been liquid! At least this beer has a pretty attractive copper-colored body which is mostly clear with a slight haze. The aroma was reminiscent of an authentic German hefeweizen or oktoberfestbier with a strong, spicy nose of clove and vanilla. TASTEUpon my first tasting of Victory Moonglow I had a weird feeling of déjà vu. Its as if I had just drunk this beer recently, and I have. Paulaners Hefeweizen and Erdingers Oktoberfest Hefeweizen immediately came to mind since this is a beer brewed in a similar style to those two. Whats interesting is that as much as this tastes like an authentic German brew, its actually the product of an American microbrewery (which imports malts and hops from Germany, according to their website).Moonglow has a very strong, spicy palate with banana, clove and vanilla being the most noticeable ingredients. Because this is such as strongly-flavored beer its initially difficult to distinguish between the three, since the overall taste is a spicy bite on your tongue. In fact, the beer has something of a dry taste and finish because its so strongly-flavored.FINISHI like a beer with some bite, but not to the point where its difficult to drink. Ive had much harsher beers than Victory Moonglow, but for a craft beer in the unfiltered wheat beer style, its surprisingly coarse. It finishes much drier than it starts out and leaves a dry, cough syrup-like aftertaste in my mouth. BODYNeither the box nor the bottle itself indicated the potency to Victory Moonglow, but I had a feeling it was higher than normal about halfway through my first bottle when I felt very inundated. Once I visited the brewers website and learned it was 8.7% ABV I realized there was a reason I felt so weighed-down. Why this beer is brewed with such a high potency without using the Imperial sub-title is a bit of a mystery. That helps explain why Victory Moonglow is such a seemingly heavy brew. I had one after dinner and chalked up my feeling bloated to drinking it too close to a meal. But after waiting a significant time to start on my second, I was surprised I felt as equally full as the first.FINAL THOUGHTSDespite all my criticisms of Victory Moonglow Weizenbock, I have to admit its a very tasty beer and I did enjoy drinking it at the time. Its very rare I encounter a beer that is so strongly flavored it actually puts me off, but I would gladly take a beer of this type over a watered-down mass-market lager any day. Its very rare to find an American microbrew come so close to its original German style, so at the very least its worth trying once.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

A-Body is a translucent dull dark red/amber hue. Pours with a foamy 2 finger head that eventually subsides completely with only small traces of lacing left behind in the glass.

S-A big sweetness comes through first with the essence of sweet raisins and grapes, with a big spicy yeast backbone. There is a touch of alcohol astringency as well.

T-Flavor is mostly fruity upfront with raisin, grape, and perhaps fig dominating upfront with a big hefty spicy yeast backbone in the background. The fruity flavors become just a hair more tart for the finish and the spicy yeast really comes out for the very end along with just a little bit of alcohol astringency.

P-Very high stinging tingly carbonation with a medium weight body. Above average but nothing special about it.

O-This is a very nice Weizenbock and is sweeter and spicier than most I have had. The spiciness of it makes for a nice Christmas beer. A job well down by Victory, I havent had a new (to me) beer of theirs in awhile and this was ling overdue.

3765,"2010-02-24",2.5,"Serving: 12 oz. bottle from Total Wine Sterling.
Pours a hazy amber-red color with yeasty chunks floating around.  Guess I didnt mix this one up quite enough.  The head is foamy, a light tan color and very active.  It settles down and disappears very quickly.  The nose is sweet with a touch of alcohol.  The yeast and wheat notes are present.  Just like you might think, a mix of a alcohol and malt like a bock and a wheat notes from a weizen.  The flavor is curiously fruity and even tart.  Sweet with notes of apple, pear, perhaps a bit of citrus and spice.  The wheat notes are light and really overpowered by the fruit and a bit of alcohol.  It has a medium mouthfeel to it but it sort of coats the tongue.  All the effervescence makes it seem lighter than it is.  For some reason this one never quite comes together in my mind.  As the beer warms some varnish notes come out making things even rougher.  I hope this one is past its prime because it certainly isnt the best beer Ive ever tasted.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

Poured from a 12oz. bottle into a tulip.

pours a very hazy amber orange color with some sediment floating and a lot of carbonation bubbles. Head is a soapy thin looking head about two fingers worth.

The nose is fruity and spicey. Some granny smith apple and and banana. A touch of cloves and coriander.

Theres a wheat like breadiness on the flavor. Granny smith again like the nose. The spice is there along with ripened banana. Definitely an alcohol presence on the finish. Not overpowering, but its noticable.

Mouthfeel is very carbonated. Tangy and tingly and lively on the tongue. Medium bodied and crisp.

Drinkability is good. Probably no more then two of these and i would have to switch it up.

Overall this is another good beer from Victory. I believe this is my first Weizenbock. Not my favorite style but i can appreciate this as a quality beer.","Pennsylvania, USA","BigMike"

3765,"2010-01-21",3.6,"Location: 12 oz bottle from Gillys, 1/21/10 


Aroma: Lots of banana, theres wheat/yeast, a bit of spice, maybe some pear

Appearance: Cloudy dark red color with a bit of orange, thin white head

Flavor: Taste is spicy yeast, some sweet malts, banana, light hops

Palate: This is a medium bodied beer with a lively carbonation and long duration, the alcohol does come through a bit as it warms, but it is pretty well hidden

Overall Impression: 
This is a very flavorful beer.  The nose gives off a good amount of banana and yeast, while the spice comes on strong in the flavor to join the strong banana and yeast flavors.  Perhaps a bit too much carbonation, but it works pretty well.  This is a very nice wheat beer with more flavor then I might have expected.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
3765,"2010-01-17",4.1,"Thanks to Secret Santa for this!  Pours a cloudy reddish brown with a moderate to big fluffy off-white head.  Looks nice!  Aroma is quite potent with cloves, cinnamon, toffee, small amounts of banana and bubblegum (which is pleasant when not dominant), grass, and maybe even brown sugar and vanilla.  Lots to offer.  Flavor of caramel, cloves, wheat bread, brown sugar, toffee, hay, and cinnamon sticks.  Finishes, with a slightly dry interpretation of the malt flavors without changing things too much.  A little toasty and grassy, slightly earthy, but similar to the flavor.  Medium to full bodied, creamy, fluffy texture and high carbonation.  Quite a winner in my book!  Probably too sweet for some , but its very good.  And like others said, the aroma IS better than the flavor.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"
3765,"2010-01-17",3.4,"12 oz. bottle. Spicy, tangy, salty, and creamy aroma features cinnamon, coriander, thyme, and orange scents. Interesting, unique, and appealing smell. Pours a hazy, bright, copper color with a large amount of small, fast-rising bubbles, and a large amount of uneven, beige head. Buttery, yeasty taste features sweet cream, vegetable (especially celery), and apple flavors. Spicy, dry finish. As is the case with many other wheat beers, the aroma exceeds the flavor in its appeal; a little dull. Strange aftertaste for which I dont much care. Medium body. Milky, smooth, and silky in the palate. Reasonably lively, though not astoundingly so. This is a classic German-style wheat beer in that it starts out so promising in the nose and appearance but ends in disappointment.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Yeasty aroma with lots of bread, sweet caramel/chocolate, ripe banana citrus peel and spicy clove.

Heavily carbonated up front with a lot of zest clove spice followed by a full yeasty/bready body with plenty of ripe banan and citrus pell and a tart dry finish. Clove is prominent but the darker caramel/choclate malt notes as well as the citrus and banana notes balance things out very nicely. The slight tart finish is what really separates this beer and makes it very flavorful. It lingers after the end of each sip and leaves me salivating for more.

3765,"2009-11-30",3.2,"12 oz bottle courtesy of the Binnys singles rack (Orland Park, IL). Pours a nice dark full amber, well hazed, some reddish orange glowing notes, a huge tannish head that bubbles well and cakes, laces ok, eventually dies to a moderate head. Aromas are fruity banana esters, a touch of apple, cinnamon, flaked white wheat, a touch of citrusy lemon, followed up by more caramelized maltiness underneath, a touch of brown sugar and breadiness. Initial is reminiscent of banana bread, assertive fruity banana esters, brown sugar, bread, a touch of sweet cakiness, vanilla. This backs a decent alcohol punch on the backend, warming as it travels down. Further in more wheat comes in, grainy, bready, sweet, with a light bitterness. In my opinion, the alcohol gets in the way on the backend, almost causing heartburn for me it is so out of place. A nice darker wheat beer would have been nice, but this takes it a little too far for me. The flavors are well in place, but the alcohol is distracting for me, detracting from the overall balance and experience. A decent enough beer with some overall flaws.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

3765,"2009-11-20",3.6,"16 ounce pint - $6.50 at Taco Mac in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Descends from the top-level tap a mid-range mahogany-hued body topped with a finger of off-white foam.

Smell: Tangy, spiced bouquet of bready dark malted wheat and supporting clove and peeled banana notes, as well as sweet-scented hints of caramel and golden syrup.

Taste: Ah, the tanginess of German wheat malt with a taste of toasted bread smothered in gooey, sweet caramel sauce. Mingled amidst the malty tastes are some spicy phenols providing a mild, easy-going cracked clove flavor. Also, some fruity touches of raisins and bananas to be found in there. Hint of sourish yeast. Lightly spicy, herbal hop character with a mild, restrained level of bitterness. Finishes tangy and malty and pretty crisp, I must say.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-high carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel.

Drinkability: An agreeable Fall seasonal that isnt just another Pumpkin Ale or Oktoberfest. Although the alcohol isnt overly evident in the taste, it sure did sneak up on me later, providing me with quite a glow of my own.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

Hint of clove seals the deal. Honestly, this is a damn good aroma. Slight alcohol presence in the flavor. The spice and banana with yeast follow through well.

3765,"2009-08-08",3.8,"Big thanks to Zathrus13 for throwing this one in as an extra many moons ago.

I could barely get this one to the glass as the foam gushed out the top.  It pours is a cloudy brown with orange hints, kinda like a cloudy tea, with a huge off-white head that leaves generous lacing and sticks around for the duration.  Tons of big chunks floating around that end up gathering together at the bottom of the glass.

The aroma is excellent and dominated by the sweet bananas, other over-ripe sweet fruits and plenty of caramel and vanilla.  The spices werent too noticeable in the nose for me - maybe some light pepper notes.

The taste isnt quite as impressive but still pretty damn good.  The initial taste is of some lighter apples and pears and the taste has lest banana-like flavors than I was expecting from the nose.  The yeast and caramel malt form a big backbone with the spices finally showing up in the finish, mostly pepper and maybe some cloves.

The mouthfeel doesnt seem quite full enough to carry the complexity of the flavors.  Its got tons of carbonation, maybe too much, and the body comes across as a little watery.

Despite the slight ding on mouthfeel, this is an excellent weizenbock - one of the best Ive had.  The aroma is world class for me and a bit thicker mouthfeel might have this one in the same league as Aventinus.  As it is, its a notch below which aint too shabby.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
3765,"2009-08-04",3.5,"Thanks must be given once more to my older sister who lives up in the northeast, Delaware to be exact, where the Victory flows freely and bottles are just one liquor store away. Heck, they may even be in some grocery stores, but I can only speculate. They brew one of the best traditional pilsners this side of Plzen, Czech; Victory Prima Pils. Today though, I am delighted to try another offering, the Moonglow Weizenbock. I am a huge fan of weizen bocks, so it would seem that the stars are shining in my favor today. Now, this is a weizen bock versus a weizen doppelbock, so while I expect a lot of the traditional aromas and flavors, they should lack some of the intensity of their bigger brothers.


Cloudy burnt maple syrup with a scattering of suspended chunks. A huge khaki hat adorns her body, though she does deflate into a more subtle blanket after being allowed to rest for a few minutes. No amount of foam though could hold back her impatient nose which is scrambling to appease my critical senses. Rich bananas and banana bread of the darker variety, pumpernickel and rye, with an interesting follow-up addition of whoppers, aka malt balls. Brown sugar and cinnamon sticks offer the perfect spice accompaniment while she shows a fruitier side with soft, suckling notes of peaches, mango, and plantains. Her finish is a warming rush of rum, wood, vanilla, and oak while more bananas come out to play. Very supple indeed, my first quaff is as satisfying as her nose promised. Ripe, soft bananas and banana bread drizzled with maple syrup while cinnamon sticks and candied pecans accompany her on the side. Her dry spices like to rest squarely on top of my tongue while rum, raisins, and prunes go for the finish. Her palate is a bit dryer than I was expecting, making for a very clean quaff each time that is only highlighted by the addition of wood notes and vanilla bean. Her fruitier side is much more subdued in the palate, showing up every now and then as a whisper of an undercurrent. Overall, her flavor points are spot on, and she isnt too heavy, otherwise then she would be bordering on a doppelbock. As my final quaff lingers with spice, wood, maple, and banana bread dotted with pecans, I am left with two conclusions. In terms of style, she is expertly executed. In terms of personal taste, I think I enjoy the heartier, more complex weizen doppelbocks better.


The Moonglow Weizenbock from Victory Brewing was good, not great but good. Definitely a more sessionable brew then her bigger brothers. If you are looking for all the flavor without the extra added weight and complexity, then the Moonglow is all you need to bring a smile to your lips and a happy gurgle to your belly.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"
3765,"2009-07-25",3.7,"11/08/2007:  Victory Moonglow Weizen Bock looks thick!  It is a cloudy caramel/golden orange color with a big, foamy ivory-colored head that has a reserve cascading effect after the initial pour and then lasts for the entire session.  It also creates thick foamy lacing throughout.  There is active carbonation, but due to the medium-full body of this beer, it still feels slightly chewy in the mouth.  Strong banana, caramelized malts, and clove spice are present in the aroma.  The strong flavor has  caramel malts, wheat, and some alcohol that cuts through at times.  This is a very good weizen bock!

Aroma is very fruity, much more on the dark fruit (plums) along with apples and oranges, than the bananas of a lighter weizen, with the usual spicy aromas of a good German hefe as well. Flavor starts out sweet, on plums again, then turns brighter and a bit citrusy. Palate is overcarbonated, bordering on harsh; it really detracts from the flavor.

3765,"2009-02-18",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2010 Pours a very hazy, muddy, orangey, copper color with a moderately full, yellowish-beige, creamy, fluffy head which is fairly lasting and leaves tight, foamy lace.  Nose is great, one of the best wheats Ive smelled; lots of estery yeast with bananas and peach notes, clove dominating, undertones of spices (nutmeg, coriander, allspice), some orange zest, maybe even some faint floral and brown sugar.  Flavor is dominated by the banana yeast esters, but underneath lies, cloves, peach skins, faint orange zest, faint nutmeg and coriander, and light sweet wheat breads.  Palate is perfect for the style; more than medium, lightly chewy, round, and nearly lively.  Somewhat refreshing but still sweet and just glimpses of dryness.  Finishes fairly long with clove, light wheat, and lingering bananas and orange zest.  One of the better examples of the style retaining refreshing qualities to match complexities and malt notes.  Not Schneider Aventinus, but certainly better than most and the ABV was unnoticable.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

Flavor starts moderately sweet and lightly acidic, then finishes lightly acidic and bitter. Palate is medium, oily, with a soft to lively carbonation. It finishes lighly metallic. A nice warming Weizenbock, complex and well balanced.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"
3765,"2008-10-24",3.4,"This is a more tame, rebottled Golden Monkey, which isnt a bad thing.
Very spicy orange/brown color and taste, a downturned citrus flavor, possibly cloves that is carried blatantly and possibly proudly by alcohol, an odd vibration of sweetness and tartness.","Bensalem, Pennsylvania, USA","BeerLS"
3765,"2008-10-23",3.9,"12 oz. bottle.  Pours hazy dark amber and features a tight, creamy light tan head with great retention and nice lacing.  Aroma is yeasty and malty sweet with lots of soft banana and clove notes. Flavor is softly tart and quite spicy with a solid malt backbone.  Medium bodied and fairly smooth, highly carbonated.  Wow - this is 8.7%?  No clue...barely warming (although I am feeling the effects)!  Surprisingly nice and works great as a fall seasonal what with all the nicely balanced malt and spice.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","surffisher"
3765,"2008-10-22",3.5,"12oz bottle. Pours a very cloudy, orangey brown with caramel-toffee-colored highlights and a thick, light tan head that fades quickly, though not completely, and leaves a thick swath of lace on the glass. The aroma is very doughy and yeasty with notes of banana and wheat. The flavor starts bready with some toasty melanoidins. Soft fruit, dark caramel, chocolate, and spices emerge next. At mid-palate, the spicy esters accentuate a spicy hop bitterness - a little more bitter than I expected for this style, but definitely pleasant. The finish is unexpectedly dry with a very subtle warming alcohol, spicy esters, fruity and spicy hop bitterness, and fresh baked bread. The mouthfeel is highly carbonated - brisk and a bit spritzy with lots of carbonation sting on the tongue (further accentuates spicy esters and finishing bitterness). After swirling around in the mouth, loads of gas are released and a thick and yeasty/slippery body is unveiled. Overall, a very decent and well-put-together weizenbock... but nothing really special (other than the fact that weizenbock is not a widely produced style). Alcohol is deftly hidden.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Fruity, spicy (mostly clove), and yeasty wheat aromas.  Notes of bananas, toasted banana bread, and some slightly dusty earthiness.  Probably the wheatiest (grainiest-tasting) wheat beer I’ve had.

Aroma is a unique combo of wheat, yeast, malt, ripe apricot, citrus, caramel, and other spices.  Taste is magnificent:  a blend of ommegangs spicy coriander-orange peel, yeast, rich malts, and other fruit.  Very impressive.  Finishes smooth and semi sweet which lingers in your mouth just the right length.  I found this beer simultaneously refreshing, unique, and complex.

I picked up a single of this since it has been a while since I have tried a weizenbock.  Because of that I was looking forward to giving this a try.  Coming from Victory my expectations were met in the form of a solid well made beer.  I dont know if I would pick up a six pack but having a few bottles around might be nice.
Aroma / Appearance - A short lived beige head graced a caramelized fluid body with hints of caramel, chocolate, topioca pudding and butterscotch.  It reminds me of a dessert tray.
Flavor / Palate - Dry apple cider spiked with a hint of caramel filled the mouth.  The overall impression was of Wurthers hard candy.  The biggest flaw was that towards the end it became cloying.  Other than this small weakness it is solid and enjoyable.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The flavor is of sweet, caramelized wheat malt and red apple with spicy notes of cloves, faint cinnamon and lightly peppery alcohol. This is a solid weizenbock, but its just a tad too hot for my tastes. Perhaps I should snag a bottle or two to see if this one would age well like Aventinus.

It seems everpresent, giving it this huge bite at the end that sorta makes you cringe, but in a good way, like if you found out that World of Warcraft was actually a ""world"" and you really were a ""dark elf incarnation of Mr. T"".  I digress.  This isnt a bad beer, just needed to round out a bit.  Theres a lot going on in there, and its unfortunate that the alcohol masks it and makes you really dig.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a cloudy, almost glowing, medium orangish brown with a small to average, off-white head that kept a thin sheet. The aroma was lighlty yeasty with red wine, honey, some fruitiness and a lot of spice a little alcohol and light milk chocolate. The initial flavor was lightly sweet and moderately acidic, while the finish was moderately sweet and sour.

Sprightly carbonation overrides a bit of bloody greasiness in the texture; medium-bodied and oddly polished.  Finishes on cleaning product and pistachio oil.  Mild afterburn of bitterness.  A pleasantly earthy disposition, though with a lot of synthetics.  Geared heavily to the wheat, lacking balance.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Tastes of banana more than anything but with brown sugar and caramel.  Almost like a mild bananas foster wthout the butter.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","jlf278"
3765,"2007-09-03",4.0,"MMMMM GOOD. This is a unique brew...a blend of a bock and its characteristic sweetness with the banana clovey taste of a wheat. I liked it.

The color of this unfiltered concoction deserves awards alone. The dark unfiltered light that shines through this Weizenbock is so beautiful, that it really reminds me of the moon glowing faintly on a dark lit ocean.. The flavor of this thing is just as complex as hints of grapefruit, plums, (it kind of reminds me of Holiday fruits and exotic spices) cover your taste buds and I mean this thing hits like a ton of bricks but without a ton of unnecessary bitterness, the fact that this thing finishes SO smooth without a hint of the epic 8.7% alc is mystical.","Pennsylvania, USA","javathehop"

If this beer was a naval warship this would be a battleship with 15 inch guns (if size of gun was proportional to amazing depth of taste) with at least two feet of steel armor (if armor was equal to wide array of aromatic delights) and at the helm was a brazen pirate captain (standing for spicy sweetness that clouds the alcohol...and has an eye patch).

The flavor has a wierd acidity to it that I didnt expect in a Weizen Bock but this seems like a very pleasant beer with well hidden alcohol, some spicy malts, sweet fruits, and good carbonation.

The nose is redolent with clove, banana, guava, dusty wheat, alcoholic fruit cocktail, mild caramel and is all wrapped up into a lovely and compact, but restrained aroma. Sweet biscuity malts are the predominant flavor, along with a now complete articulation of a dense profile laced with more banana and tropical fruits, wheat, caramel, sweet alcohol(like an unfiltered, milky vodka) and some lingering spice.

3765,"2007-01-18",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 25, 2014 Bottle.  Sweet yeast-and-candis aroma, spicy cloves, bubblegum, and wheat, only light bubblegum.  Very malty with some sticky fruitiness and alcohol.  Cloudy amber-brown gradient with an ephemeral light brown head (more Bock than Weizen), big legs, and lots of sediment.  Crisp, sharp beginning, warming, lightly harsh end.  Quick tongue-buzz.  Taste is sweet malt with caramel, yeast, and a touch of dark earthiness to be detected underneath the cloves and light banana.   Lots of wheat flavor.  Alcohol does play a major role here (though Id only peg it at around 6% from taste).  Body is medium but very sticky-creamy, at times gives the impression of much more fullness.  Good deal of tang and light acidity, no real hop count, but a good balance on the whole.  Texture and mouthfeel are just fantastic here, but the carbonation could still be backed off a bit more.  Great smooth sipper, and great to style - a true, flavorful blend of a Dunkelweizen and a dark Bock - hair below the Schneider.  [2007.01.18: 3.8]Well, maybe more than a hair, but still holds up -- one of Victorys stronger offerings, to be honest, and thankfully doesnt shy from the bitterness to slop on more sugar.

Candy-like aromas of Juicy Fruit gum, caramel covered apples and ripe banana are noted with mild fresh yeast and hot dinner rolls lurking in he background. Pleasant, full, round mouthfeel with just the right amount of tingly carbonation for the style. Taste is sweet, reminiscent of banana-nut bread, caramel apple, crystal malts, fresh yeast and mild spices.

3765,"2006-01-25",4.7,"This is a unique German beer style, that is a wheat bock. This style of beer is very similar to dunkle hefeweizen, in that it is an ale, it is brewed with a significant portion of wheat malt, along with some dark malts, and it is bottle conditioned. The yeast strain used in this beer, is the Weihenstaphan strain, which is used in brewing classic Bavarian hefeweizen. Where it differs is that it has the alcohol strength of a bock beer, around 7-8% abv. 

Moonglow pour to a murky deep caramel color with a huge, thick, rocky head, and a very lively carbonation. The nose is superb on this beer. Aromas of clove, banana, and ripe fruit marry with sweet malt aroma, and peppery waves of alcohol. The palate is very complex with just layers of flavor. Sweet malt, a touch of caramel, pear, perhaps, some melon, and subtle hints of spice all slide over the tongue. This beer finishes with more good malt flavors up front, then ends with that classic spicy clove/bubble gum yeast character that is signature of the Weihenstaphan strain.

The aroma is hugely banana and wheat bread.  It smells so much like fresh bananas, its insane.  Its like bananas were used in the fermentation.  Theres also some light yeasts and vanilla.  Can you say banana bread?  Unreal!  The flavor is dramatically different from the aroma.  I dont get any banana in the flavor.  Instead, I get a toasted malt and light clove.  Thinking to recent wheat-based beers, its like they used the toasted sprouts from Bells wheat series, but left a lot of the other stuff out.  Light spices and ever so light rauch smokeyness.  Malty, yes.  Distinguished, no.  But, still, it is good.  Anyway, the palate is moderately thick and creamy.  Feels pretty good and goes down smoothly.  Lightly chewy.  A good brew from Victory!

Creamy in the mouth with lilting spiciness to finish and pleasant smokiness throughout. Many more complexities than I was expecting.

Pours a soup murky apple cider and cherry juice pour, with flecks of light and dark yeast. Head is tall and orange tinted. Aroma is reserved, yet loaded with fresh warm alcohol, over french pears sauteed with butter. Theres a bready yeast background, typical of the style. Flavor is interesting, a rich strong run of bright fruit alcohol, followed by a mouthful of warm bread, sugary malt and spicy yeast. The beer almost starts out like a tart fruit beer, with some of those sour notes, but then moves into the typical cloying wheat and bock characters. Very intersting. I think this beer has really picked up something with time. Delicious. The alcohol is a little hot right of the bat, but also really carries the beer. I dont really detect any off notes, just some really matured flavors, nothing indicative of oxidation or being light struck.

3765,"2005-10-29",4.3,"Acquired in a trade from BA Px2GrafX, the beer poured out murky amber brown in color with a rich creamy head typical of most Weizen biers. The looks were like a Weizen concentrate, and so was the smell. The smells of banana and clove were found here with a pungency that other Weizens rarely ever exhibit. The taste was again very similar to a hyper Hefeweizen, with every phenolic element present, but only more so. Reminiscent of liquefied banana nut bread with spices, this beer went down very easily with not a single hint of the high ABV content. To add an American twist to the style, a definite hop bitterness was detectable towards the end of each swallow. Carbonation was extremely fine and gave this a creamy mouthfeel. What a dangerously drinkable beer! I can see this one getting someone is trouble quite easily, as it packs quite a punch that you can never see coming. Quite different from Aventinus, as this is more Weizen than Bock.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
3765,"2005-10-27",3.9,"Ah, a wheat beer that a stout/barleywine drinker like myself can really enjoy. I usually find wheat beers too light for my taste, although I love sniffing them. This beer isnt light, which is good, and its crispness keeps it from tasting heavy. I could just smell this beer all night (if someone could bottle just the scent, Id spray it all over my wife): I get banana and clove, maybe pear, ginger and taffy. Where most wheat beers let me down when I go from smelling to tasting, this beer comes through with concentrated flavors, so what you smelled is what you get. I could not detect the strong alcohol in the flavor. I really liked this beer, but at $12 (with tax) for a six pack, the price is prohibitive, and I wont be buying it again for a long time.

Incredible esters: bubblegum, apple, orange and lemon citrus, wet grass, yeast, gym sock funk, and an overall rotten sourness much like red apples beginning to go bad; perfect fall aromas. Medium to full body, full and smooth mouthfeel, flavors of all of the above wrapped up nicely in an overall yeasty malt sweetness. Sweet and sour aftertaste.

3765,"2005-09-21",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 23, 2005 (12 oz bottles: Obtained in trades with jah noth, goldtwins and IMtheOptimator, thanks Dan, Larry and Andrew!) Ive collected four bottles of Moonglow in trades from sources in three different states because Ive had very bad luck with this beer.  All previous attempts to sample this beer from a bottle have been unsuccessful as each one was sour and presumably infected.  All have been aged for at least a few months, with this one being aged the least (4 months beyond the so-called expiration date).  This is the first bottle of this recently-acquired group and fortunately, its healthy and delicious.  It pours a bright ruddy amber color, and by swirling in all the yeast sediment, the beer is cloudy and translucent, so I can barely make out the carbonation bubbles rising to the surface.  The light-tan head doesnt pour terribly large, but it has settled at a thin, complete layer atop the beer, though it does eventually fade to a small ring.  The nose is very yeasty and estery, with some banana and a bit musty.  Wheat and esters first and foremost, sweet and caramely, some banana and bubble gum, a gentle tartness, and a hint of spiciness in the finish thats pretty unusual for the style.  There is also a mild bitterness in the finish, but Im less enthused about this development.  Eructation presents a massive blast of banana and bubble gum.  Body is medium-full, well-carbonated, somewhat dense and thick, but thanks in part to the gentle tartness, its not in syrupy or sticky, so maybe too, that mild bitterness in the finish is a good idea after all.  Well, even though it easily falls short of Aventinus (what doesnt?), this is very tasty, wonderfully authentic, and worth the effort to finally get some good bottles.  And Im very happy that I still have three more bottles in my cellar.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
3765,"2005-09-19",4.1,"Bottle.  Bottled:  08/25/05.  Pours a thick, murky, diarrhea brown with a big, creamy dark-khaki head that leaves a thick ring of lace.  Wheaty, yeasty aroma with some lemony citrus, banana, apple cider and spicy notes.  The body is as thick as it sounded in the pour.  Wheat, yeast, lemon and banana in the forefront, followed by a very rich caramelly and estery maltiness.  Hints of dark fruits and pears.  Finishes with some spices and a big alcohol burn that dries the back of the throat.  This would be near perfect if they dropped the alcohol down just a tad.","Washington DC, USA","lamas"

Initial taste is almost like cough syrup like.  Palate is very thick.  I think the initial cough syrup taste and feel may have been due to the cold temp it was served at and the thicker feel.  As it warmed up I actually started feeling more of an apple cider taste with an alcohol burn on the tongue.  Some citrus in the flavor as well.  6-4-6-3-14

Re-rate 10/14/2006. It has been a while since I last had this and my palate has expanded quite a bit.  This one deserves a re-rate.

The aroma is sweet malt, bubblegum?, mild citrus and banana and a bit of spiciness. The initial taste is nearly candy like malt sweetness with some yeast notes and orange, banana, and coriander. The mid-taste is very citric; oranges and lemon really balance out the initial sweetness. The finish is spicy and a touch hot, but not badly so.

 2004 Bottle from notes dated 12/2004:   Pours orange and cloudy with a hefty frothy white head.  The first aromas that pop out are coriander, banana and oranges.  After the head subsides, elements of grapes, apples and yogurt peak through.  Taste is of oranges and lemons with a very nice earthy finish.  This was my last 2004 bottle.

2003 bottle sampled in 2005:  Pours amber and not as cloudy.  Theres quite a bit of sediment at the bottom of this bottle.  The smells of coriander and oranges are still there surprisingly and the butterscotch notes have come out even more.  The banana and bubblegum detectable in the 2005 batch are no longer there, but the raisins and fig notes are still present.  Mouthfeel is still very thick and complex.

2005 bottle sampled in 2005: Pours cloudy and brownish with a tan lasting head.  Smells of rasberries, sugar, and caramel.  Taste is of bananas, coriander, oranges, butterscotch, toffee.

Pours a cloudy tan/leather color with a decent head that vanishes while your back is turned, leaving just a hint of a foam ring behind.  The nose on this beer may be the most interesting Ive sampled this past year or so--very involved with wheat wang, apples, pears, and maybe clove and nutmeg as well.  The mouthfeel is fuller than I would expect, but I guess for a beer with 8.7% ABV going for it, the mouthfeel is to be expected--its the lighter color that kind of throws me off.

The flavor explodes with all kinds of stuff--banana, pears, nutmeg and clove to be sure, but I get a clear sense of salt water taffy from it.  I also get just a decent level of acidity that helps this beer from being cloyingly sweet, since I dont detect much in the way of hops here.

Truly a flavorful beer, and an interesting experience.  Im not sure that its my everyday cup of tea, but its got the guts to step up and be counted.

The nose is a silent killer. It is truly phenomenal. Tart cherries, apple skin and suprisingly there are not many traditional weizen flavors (babana, nutmeg and clove), some but very little. The smell is lovely but bizarre for the style. It sort of resembles a brown beer from flanders in its nose. 

The first taste is luscious, sharp and full of flavor. Banana first, then a clove spicyness along with a little peach. Next is the sourness. Its bizarre but acidic and full of a lovely sour apple and orange spicyness. The alcohol is hidden throughout, until the finish where it aids in a delicious aftertaste.

3765,"2004-09-28",4.0,"12 oz. brown, longneck bottle. One of a six-pack. Freshness date is of Mar 01 05. Loud pfftt when opened. Poured out a hazy, orangish caramel color, with a huge tan head at first. It slid back to a thin lacing on top of the beer itself. Aromas are of orange caramel cremes, cloves, slight bubblegum, not too much in the way of banana, yeasty bread, and fresh malts. Tastes are of oranges, caramel cremes, cloves, malts, vanilla, and the flavors change as the beer warms up. Thick, rich mouthfeel, creamy and smooth. Alcohol hits you as its swallowed, warming you right up.
Finishes somewhat fruity, and alcoholic. A really well made Weizenbock.","","Cobra"

Flavor is quite sour with lots of citrus (acidity) and dark fruits.  The first sip is just an explosion of fruitiness.  Finish extremely sour with virtually no bitterness.  Really unique, and very tasty.  Above-average richness.  Im really surprised at how many people (especially high-ratings-count people) have given this drink absolutely horrible ratings.  I am really impressed by this; its one of the more unique beers I have tried, and I really like it.  The first ounce is better than the last, though; I think the sourness starts to overpower the fruit as you get through the beer.

Taste: plenty of it! Tantalizing, mouthfilling, happily coating the palate, leaving behind spicy, grapey flavors. A bit light going down, but never lagging with the flavor.

3765,"2004-03-14",2.1,"Bottle says ""Enjoy by Aug 20 04"". I did anything but ""Enjoy"" this one. The taste of this beer is outright not at all what I was expecting it to be for a weizen bock of which I have rated six total. It had a medium sized creamy and smooth vanilla head with fine sized bubbles. The body was carbonated and semi-transparent with an orange-brown hue. The nose was fruity, spicy and citrus. The flavor was acidic, lightly bitter, very sour tasting, and somewhat exotic fruity tasting which did not set well with my palate by any means.

The mouth feel is sour and off with an initial repulsive reaction from me.  Not what I was expecting at all.  The flavor contains notes of clove, mild vinuousness, malt,  fruity esters and probably a few others that are quite exotic.

Has sweeter notes of grape, banana and plum, yet balances it out with the wheat, some spice, like nutmeg and clove.  Taste hides the alcohol quite well, as it is smooth intially then has a considerable bite to the end of it.  Leaves a warm sweeter feel on the tongue and a little sizzle on the lips.

Lets take a sip….. kind of a sour shock that I was not expecting! I certainly picks up some sweet toffee / caramel notes in the finish but he initial punch has a bitter doughy rotten lemon bite, very strange. It’s like an old bruised pear with some coriander, clove and nutmeg sprinkled atop. But the finish fades to a herbal spicy honey resemblance… I don’t know what’s going on with this brew?

Flavor is a mixture of sweet, grainy caramel maltiness, citrusy lemon, mushy old brown banana, apple juice, spices, yeast and peppery alcohol in the finish along with a faint amount of hop bitterness.  Rather unwelcome fizzy palate, medium-full body.  Suffering from a sour infection and a lack of integration.  Finishable but not good.

3765,"2003-11-19",3.8,"Super nice concentrated color, looks like a solid glass of dark caramel, some yellowness peaks around the edges, a thin loose tannish head emerged that didn't last and the lacing is very minimal. Aroma is super tangy of fruity citrus, ripe melon, orange peels, mango, peach, dulled grapes, quite a fruit juice effect in the aroma, underlaying sweet malts and musty yeast, notes of ethanol. Taste is a lip smacking attack of tangy dullish citrusy fruits, mostly orange peels and peach skins with some mango and light banana mixed in. Pretty sweet and quickly tangy, malty, twingy with notes of raw orange peels coming through late in the finish as it drys out somewhat and keeping a sweetly souring, almost puckering tang. Feel is a bit thin at first but begins to fill in as it goes and drys out some in the finish. Sneaky alcohol hits your head after half the glass. A pretty decent brew, the tangyness is pretty high with a overall orange peel effect throughout its character. I can see where some would like this, but I don't think I'd try this again, but I wouldn't turn it down if offered either.

Aroma is very weizen: lemony, banana, spices, wheat, and yeast with a toasted malt nose amplified by the bock nature of the brew. Yummy fruity and spicy taste initially followed by a mild bitter and zesty yeast character. Lively and smooth mouthfeel with a lingering spice finish. Alcohol was completely masked, great job. Well done and very enjoyable beer. Citrusy enough to be refreshing yet increased body to be a fall classic. I liked it a lot and will need to get more.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Color is lighter and redder than Aventinus, and it is a bit less cloudy.  Taste is banana and even a hint of melon, with a strong clove finish.  Spritzy but full mouthfeel.  Sweeter, more sour, and spicier than an Aventinus.  Another great brew from Victory.  // Rerated 8 February.  Incredible variation in the way different bottles age.  Some are still great, like my first bottle, which I loved.  Some are drain pour.  Some are in between.  I left my individual rankings unchanged from my first, perfect bottle.  But accuracy demands that the overall impression ranking reflects the high variation among bottles.  // Rerated the 2003 vintage after having it draft at the brewery.  Cloudy reddish brown with a huge soft foamy tan head.  Mouth filling, huge viscous feel.  Dark malt, sweet fruit, especially melon on top of the more usual banana, with some spice and hoppy bite.

The flavor is vinous, citric, malty, and slightly sour.  This one is less weizen than other weizen bock beers I have had.  It takes some of the spice and fruit qualities of the weizen, but the main thrust of the beer is the malty bock.  Rating #2 - Bottle (8, 4, 7, 4, 16).  A murky swamp brownish color with a laced tan head.  The aroma has a spice that is a little sweet before it gives way to a malty bock nose.

I think the added yeast helped in the aroma, which was of pear, and clover, and other fruitiness.  Started out tasting more fruity, and finished up slightly spicy.  Really smooth- alcohol is hidden really well, although it left a slight zing on my lips after it went down.  Not too carbonated, which made it go down nice and easy.

Rerate: Hazy and deep red-orange with a frothy head. Yeasty nose. Nice and rich texture; sort of milkshake-like. Malts were wheaty and doughy, and rather sugary. Flowery, balancing bitterness. Complex fruit notes throughout, such as plums, apricots, prunes and raisins.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

3765,"2002-03-06",3.6,"SOme great flavors intermixed with some unwelcome ones.  Heavy esters.  Almost underattenuated.  A tough style.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
3765,"2002-01-20",3.2,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2008 Aroma is dominated by fruity notes of apples, musty yeast and hint of caramel malt.  Palate is much lighter than I expected.  Pours with a cloudy orange-brown color with fast dissipating head that ends up in a whisp of bubbles.  Unexpected sour taste (green apples) with undertones of numbing caramel. Not bad.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3765,"2002-01-17",3.6,"A dangerous beer that in no way hints that it is almost 9%.  I got a spoiled apple taste that I couldnt get to like.  Thanks VENOM!","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
3765,"2002-01-08",2.4,"Im a little disappointed with this one.  All I got was apples, sour apples and lots of them.  Maybe I am basing all my expectations on the aventinus standard, but I expected much more of the clove/banana phenolic flavor.  I actually held back on rating this beer after my first taste to see if I got the same flavor out of more than one bottle, sadly I did.  I will try this beer again, I hope it fares better.  One good thing I can say is that it hid its alcohol well.","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"
3765,"2001-12-16",4.2,"Unfiltered, deep copper. Looks like apple cider. Smells of cloves, apples and other spices.  Malt,banana, cloves, pears and  a citric pop on the palate that is melded together quite impressivley. The citric acidity adds some balance and character. Could use a little more body but im not complaining.  Wait, theres alcohol in this? Superb brewing. Nicely done and quite the treat.  If comparing to Aventinus, not as thick or creamy but stands on its own quite well. Definitley top shelf and is  something to come back to. Thank you Venom!!","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"

3765,"2001-11-28",4.8,"This stuff is excellent.  Typical wheat beer profile highliting the banana and clove undertones in the taste and aroma.  Silky smooth mouthfeel, and dangerously drinkable.","New Brunswick, USA","aledrinkerLS"
3765,"2001-11-28",3.3,"Cloudy, dirty brown; Head starts thick and dissipates quickly; Lots of apples in the aroma.
This one completely reminded me of old-style apple juice in appearance and aroma. Alcohol masked completely until about 3/4 through when you feel it in your head. The palate was maybe the most disappointing aspect of this beer, I really expect more heft in the mouth when I drink this style. Every other weizen-bock that I ever had was full of bananas and I thought it was strange that this one was all apples. I saw pears in other reviews, but I sensed apples. I will definitely need to revisit this one. Thank you VENOM!!","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
3765,"2001-11-16",3.8,"VENOM is giving this one away like it was Big Daddy IPA, but I dont see anyone complaining.  Its been a while I had the opportunity to catapult a beer into the Top Ten, but Im afraid it wont happen today.  Very nice beer, though - cloudy chestnut appearance; lovely aroma of banana, soft malt (biscuits, soft caramel tones) and pears.  The palate is a little less complex, but brings wheat, pears and rounded malt flavours to the table.  It is fairly acidic, and that helps balance out the malts, leaving the brew far more drinkable than one would prefer an 8.7%er to be.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
3765,"2001-10-28",4.8,"Awesome. Fruity and yeasty aroma, dark cloudy light brown color. Fruity, apple and citrus tastes with a distinct malty finish. A new beer for my top ten.","Jeannette, Pennsylvania, USA","dolemike1"
3765,"2001-10-17",4.2,"This is real nice.  Love the yeast notes in this one.  Fruit/citrus highlights in the middle, finishes with a great malt character. This is delicious.","trenton, New Jersey, USA","ssurp"
3765,"2001-10-15",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 21, 2004 Wooooo.  Nose wheaty, whiffs of bubblegum and yeast, slightly earthy as well, quite intriguing.  Initial flavor is sharp and zesty, very fruity, lemony, and crisp.  The finish is wonderfully smooth and malty, nice sweetness with some hints of caramel and qutie bready.  An incredibly interesting brew.  Sits absolutely beautifully, lovely cloudy texture.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
3765,"2001-10-12",4.2,"Great nose, large head and generous lace. Malt start, a bit tart and a nice cloudy dark amber color. Hops are present as is the high abv in the after taste. Damn good beer. thanks Venom.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
3765,"2001-10-04",4.5,"Whoa! Hold on! When a beer is compared favorably to Aventinus that is made by an American brewer, its worth trying! Rich, Spicy,yeasty what a fantastic beer!","Smithfield, Virginia, USA","bonvivant"
3765,"2001-09-07",4.2,"Very much like Aventinus, but alittle spicier and slightly lemony. Malty and sharp on the tongue. Very tasty.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
3765,"2001-09-05",4.4,"Note quite delectable, this delicious beer exhibits a malty banana, slightly spicy aroma.  Unfiltered dark brown without much head. Sharp taste, primarily banana and malt accompany the underlying warming alcohol.  Aventinus is a touch smoother, however the smooth plum, banana, and fudge finish is noteworthy and quite memorable.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
3765,"2001-03-03",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2003 This is now called the Moonglow Weizenbock, and
what a great beer it is.  It contains all
the best traits of both a bock and a weizen.
Aroma is full of the yeasty/spicy notes of banana,
clove and lemon zest - yet also sweetly malty.  Flavor
is more of the same, without the lemon zest.  Medium bodied,
giving it the kick of a bock and the refreshing quaffability
of a weizen.  Very nice.  <P> Update: less of the weizeny esters are present and this beer is dominated by a sweet melanoidin palate and a strong alcoholic finish.  A notable acidity, I think, plays a role in diminishing the esters.   Enjoyed the cloudy blood-orange glow in the glass, though - a nice treat on Halloween night.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
