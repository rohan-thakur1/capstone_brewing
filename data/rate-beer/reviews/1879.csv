Dispensed to a shaker displaying a clear, golden hue, with a frothy layer of soft white foam, and doily-like cling to the lacing. The nose was lightly perfumed/floral, with pleasant malt & honey sweetness, and just a touch of fruitiness as pit variety. Light to medium bodied, and a lively carbonation, the taste was similar notes, crisp, and nicely sessionable. The bartender was not sure of the style, so due to the light color, fruitiness, lighter body, and modest hop influence, I told him that my impression was that of a Light Hybrid/Blonde. Ill stick with that although there are some similarities between the 2 styles.(Helles & Blonde)","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

1879,"2015-01-08",3.3,"12oz bottle, poured into a snifter. The aroma is initially bready, with a corn muffin touch, combined yeasty, slight damp, egg drop soup funk which fades. The bread and corn remain, although less so, with a faint honey and citrus sweet late. It pours a clear, effervescent gold, topped by a light, fizzy, white head that reduces quick eventually leaving just a small fuzzy island and a touch of lace. The beers taste is a medium-light sweet and light bitter. Its thin, fuzzy, and light. My initial reaction is that its a more polished version of PBR, but not as fuzzy or full, and smoother. The flavors of bread and corn muffin come through first with a honey smoothness and zesty citrus finish containing light spruce notes. Theres a grassy and bread aftertaste akin to aforementioned PBR, but much lighter and more pleasant.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Appearance: Pours out a yellow-hued body with good clarity and a foaming, fast evaporating, white head.

Smell: Some pale malts, a tad bready, with some pils malt, notes of lightly sweet-scented honey, herb, and modest underlying yeastiness.

Taste: Pils malts, a bit of graininess, and a medium degree of honeyed sweetness. Herbal hops, though light, as well as is the imparted bitterness. Hint of white grapeskins. Faintly yeasty. Drying, fairy clean finish where, though the overall carbonation is a bit light, theres a fast flash on tingliness as it closes out.

Mouthfeel: Falls somewhere just a bit shy of medium-bodied. Medium-low carbonation.

Overall: Solid little bock.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
1879,"2012-05-16",2.9,"On tap at Brickhouse BBQ in Madison, WI. Pours a crystal clear, golden body with an off-white, thin head that dissipates quickly and leaves a light lacing. Aroma is lightly sweetened grainy malts with some honey and a light fruitiness. A light breadiness to the malts. Flavor is similar. Lightly sweetened grainy malts with a touch of honey bread. Some light fruits and a touch of sweetness as this finishes clean and slightly dry with a light bitterness. Shorter aftertaste following a light, clean, smooth body and a light carbonation. Overall, a clean and simple heller bock. Grainy with a light honey sweetness and just enough of a bitterness to balance. Not bad.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

1879,"2012-04-14",3.5,"UPDATED: APR 22, 2012 I like it and would drink it as a session beer when given the chance.  I enjoy the style and this does it justice.

Aroma is bready/malty with some clover that rounds out with honey.

Appearance is a pretty crisp golden clear color that starts off with a bright white head which dissipates pretty quick leaving some light lacing behind.  

When it comes to the taste of this honey bock, its really more of a cereal and bread concoction that has some honey shining through.  More so as you drink it.  Very slight bitterness and probably could use a bit more honey, but its close to being the perfect amount.  Thats just a personal preference for more sweet than bitter.

Its a good beer that is great for drinking lots of in spring to summer weather which isnt what they advertise it as, but for me is more suited to that type of weather.  I like a heartier beer in the fall, winter, early spring. 

Quick re-rate:  I had this when my allergies were bothering me and couldnt get the full flavor.  Second bottle was better and more fragrant and flavorful than the first.  The honey really shined through.  I really like this bock.","Illinois, USA","jason1970"

Cabin Fever pours a golden straw color with a 3 cm. white, pillowy head. The head fades rather quickly, leaving just a remnant of its former self. Scattered lace. Some carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass.

Definite honey presence, with soft herbal and grassy notes in the aroma. A touch of bready malt.

The flavor starts with a light, honey sweet light malt. A grassy hay feeling in the middle leads into the herbal hops. A touch of honey helps to round out the flavor in the end.

I could tell from the appearance that this was going to be a little light on the carbonation. Doesnt quite have the crisp feel that I was looking for.

Flavors largely follow suit, again showing sweet honey-kissed breakfast cereal, blonde raisins, and sweet baking bread dough yeast.  The difference comes in the hop component, which emerges to show a mild grassy and floral character that is not really prominent in the aroma.  The palate sports a medium-full, silky smooth body, with low to moderate carbonation, though it finishes slightly syrupy and warming with alcohol.  Overall, its a very fine Heller Bock.

It has a classic smell, yes they added honey but the smell is a good helles bock flavor with bready malts, a hint of caramel, some nuttiness and a touch of hops.There is a little bit of fruit in there too.

The flavor is a little bit weaker. The malt is buttery and biscuity and the hops dont really show themselves in the flavor like they should. They add flavor but arent assertive, they do nothing to balance the sweetness. I generally like NG lagers but this one fails in the taste.

Honey maybe, yeast more likely, but some emergent amalgam even more likely. I sometimes have trouble with Hellers. Sometimes they take my beloved pilsner malt and morph it into something sickly and oh-too-sweet. This one doesnt.

Initial is lighter bodied, a touch of sweet breads and honey, faint vanilla, pale malts. Light grassiness, the honey grows on me, tender and light sweetness linger with bread. Very smooth with touches of grass, honey, vanilla, sweet breads and maybe a touch of cornmeal. Tasty and smooth, flows down easily with mellow sweetness, light grassy and clover bitterness, bread and honey. Nice. Mellow.

The head slowly gives way to a small film of bubbles on the top that leaves spares bits of lace on the inside of the glass. Aroma is a little difficult to detect but eventually shows some bready malt and light grassy hops. Flavor is richer than I was prepared for -- I was expecting a standard pilsner-type lager for some reason (partially because the neck label describing the style had fallen off) and didnt realize it was a bock until after I took a sip and went to read the description to see what I had gotten myself into. Anyway, the flavor is big-time rich biscuity and sweet malt with a light, crisp hop bitterness in the background. Palate is medium-thick with a lingering sweet-malt finish. As the name suggests, this is a perfect beer for welcoming the first signs of spring after a long hard Northern Midwest winter.","Chicago, USA","TheEnemy"

1879,"2010-05-20",3.8,"Pours a slightly richer than pale golden color with a big fluffy white semi loose head that tightens up and becomes fluffy and beautiful and leaves some good lace on the glass.  The initial aroma reminds me of the boiling beer on the stovetop when you make bratwurst, not a bad smell at all just not one you usually get from beer prior to bringing it to a boil. This gives way to a the dominant aroma which is bready baguette. All of this is accented with some nice but light floral notes. I really like the way this smells, its aromatic but simple, its subtle and clean but has some very definitive characteristics none the less.  The flavor is also very clean and has some nice finesse The thing that catches me right away is that the beer is dry, far more dry than the typical product that advertises honey as a definitive ingredient to the beer. The flavor that the honey imparts is not likely sweetness as the bit of that thats in here seems to be covered pretty well by the malt as opposed to any adjunct. There is some spiciness and richness that reminds me a little bit of good honey, but I will admit that if it didnt say honey on the bottle it is not very likely that I would have picked on on much honey flavor. Which is of course ironic because honey flavor seems to be a very definitive characteristic to many pale/heller/mai bock beers. Beyond this whole honey bit there is a nicely subtle hop zing mainly in the herbal vein. The bready maltiness is just slightly toasty and there is just a slight hint of cereal in there as well.  This is a damn well balanced & wonderfully crafted lager, the likes of which are some of the most exciting beers that New Glarus makes.  The palate is just lightly sharp and the beer is fabulously easy to drink, as evidenced by the fact that as I write this I am finishing the bottle, as opposed to the Barley Wines I have this many notes for after about two oz. I would happily drink pint after pint of this beer.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

Thanks to noncaloric for sending a pair of these in a trade. I almost drank both in a single night because this is one of the lightest easiest drinking bocks I have tried that still has enough flavor to set it apart. It still falls near the bottom of the spectrum for New Glarus but that has more to do with their upper range and the style. If I could still buy New Glarus locally there would probably be a six pack in the fridge as I type this.

Aroma / Appearance - Golden yellow with strong carbonation the body sparkles with life. Delicate, the foamy head bobs like an ice floe above the liquid supporting it. Honey drizzled over toasted white bread and a mild sweetness gives this some flavor. It is somewhat weak; however it was just enough to meet my expectations.

Flavor / Palate - Honey, dry white toast, and a trace amount of sugary glazing put this a step or two above Totally Naked. Still fairly bland the finish is about what you would expect. The only unusual thing is the mouthfeel which is heavier than anticipated for what is a lightweight beer. New Glarus hasnt exactly hit a home run but this is just what you would expect for something that appeals to the masses.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1879,"2010-02-07",2.7,"Golden color with a thin but foamy white head. Aroma of honey and hops. Anitialy sweet taste of honey with a light malty body and high carbonation. Not bad but overall dominated by the honey.","Neenah, Wisconsin, USA","mcjay"
1879,"2010-02-04",2.8,"Pours a clear red-gold with a thin white head.  Aroma has hints of malt sweetness.  Subtle malt flavor, some honey.  Light-medium bodied, no hop bitterness.  Just ok, needs a little more flavor and body.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","triguy84"
1879,"2010-02-01",3.6,"12 ounce bottle courtesy of madvike. Thanks! Pours a clear pale golden color with a thin white creamy head. Good head retention and lacing. Aroma of grassy hops and pale malts with a sweet honeyish finish. The taste is sweet and dominated by the honey, with some toasted malt notes, caramel and a grassy hop finish. Medium bodied and smooth. Good beer, highly drinkable.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
1879,"2010-01-31",3.0,"Clear yellow gold color with a good sized foamy head.  Grain and yeast combine for a faintly metallic aroma.  Flavor is Grain and light grassy hops with a bit of malt in the back.  Light and a bit watery on the palate.  Not quite what I expected from a heller but decent enough.","Wisconsin, USA","twindadplus2"
1879,"2010-01-30",3.6,"New Glarus: the only brewery that could make me excited about a pale bock.  Golden pour with a white head that settles into a film.  Malty sweet aroma with light hints of honey, a bit of clove and other spices.  Flavor is somewhat sweet, light honey notes intertwined throughout and a light bitterness.  Medium bodied, nice and lively on the palate.  Finishes clean and nice.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
1879,"2010-01-29",3.2,"aroma is clean pilsner malts and fleeting honey note that at times combines to dog urine.  honey fades and palate cleans up leaving pale, clean grain and strong nearly sharp floral note.  ultra sharp pour, translucent straw with low cab and absolutely zero lacing.","River Grove, Illinois, USA","satan165"
1879,"2010-01-24",3.6,"Certainly not like a bock, but a good beer nonetheless.  A yellow lager with a little haze.  Considerable yeast, malt, and a little honey, but it makes me think of more of a helles or even kolsch than a bock.  Like most New Glarus lagers, this is exceptionally drinkable.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
1879,"2010-01-24",3.3,"12 oz bottle.  Pours clear and golden, very light lager-esque.  Lots of bubbles rising in the glass.  First sniff from the bottle reminds of Miller Lite.  Aroma from the glass fairly similar, but with slight honey and grassy notes.  Flavor sweet and malty up front with honey pretty prominent throughout.  Finishes with crisp hops and some grass.  Tiny amount of hop bitterness lingers.  Not horribly complex, but done well.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","coharahawk"
1879,"2010-01-24",4.0,"Bottle. Pours a clear bright yellow with lively carbonation. Visually it could be mistaken with a  macro. Flavor is light and sweet, golden barley and hints of honey. Light bodied and smooth with floral and Euro hop notes. Slightly sweet in the finish. This beer is amazing! Could drink this often.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","WisconsinBeer"
1879,"2010-01-24",2.7,"Pours a clear honey color with very thin white head. Aroma is very mild, just a blend of barley and hops. Flavor is at first the standard earthy barley/hops and after wards the honey flavors hits the tongue. Its almost that one the honey flavor registers the beer seems as if syrupy on the palate, however that is not the case. Body is light yet creamy with a fair amount of carbonation.","Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA","Tripplebrew"
1879,"2010-01-24",3.5,"Bottle.  Clear lager yellow pour, little carbonation and a pleasant honey and malt aroma.  Flavor wasnt to complex, but decent amount of honey and light hops and finished dry, sweet and well balanced.  Very good.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","DalzAle"
1879,"2010-01-22",3.4,"Thanks for the bottle bro!  Pours a clear straw color with bubbly white head.  Aroma is of light honey, caramel malt, light floral hops and light ripe fruit.  Taste is of sweet malt, honey sweetness, toasted grain and light fruit.  Has a slight tang in the mouthfeel, but it fits the beer well.  Good offering from Dan and company.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Juelze"
1879,"2010-01-22",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 20, 2012 (bottle) Pours a perfectly clear light golden color with a dense, medium white head and a bit of lacing.  Aroma isnt particularly strong, some light floral honey, significant lager yeast, must, breakfast cereal, and some dough.  Light kicks of hops.  The flavor is also not particularly strong or complex, but its really well put together, with a restrained underlying sweetness that begins in the mid until ending quite toasty and faintly bitter on the finish.  The sweetness is reminiscent of honey butter spread over toast, and exhaling after drinking accentuates this effect.  Mouthfeel is medium, with fairly lively carbonation.  This is simple, restrained, and highly sessionable.
(re-rate)  Ive craved this beer from time to time since having it last, and I believe this batch is even better than last years.  Just an excellent lager.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
1879,"2010-01-20",3.9,"Now seems to be just called Honey Bock with Cabin Fever found around the picture on the label.  Pours a crisp yellow-gold color with a medium creamy and soapy white head which fades rather quickly.  Aroma is roasted grains, honey, and light citrus.  Taste is thicker than a Pilsner but has similar carbonation, and the palate has a bit of citrus and lots of toasted grains.  Drinkable as all hell.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Petrucci914"
1879,"2010-01-19",3.9,"12oz bottle.  Hyper-filtered orange yellow beneath a thin, soapy head.  Sweet, fresh honey-malt aroma with a gentle bock touch.  Smooth on the palate, medium bodied.  The honey just works perfectly with this one, smoothing the beer out.  Certainly still displays some fruity bock yeast tones as well.  Excellent, with a clean, freshness that NG really excels at.  Mild hop balance, just enough to work with the carbonation.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
1879,"2010-01-17",3.4,"Very light,bright hue, getting mostly grain in aromaway deep down there is some sweet malt,probaly the honey influence, taste is sweet on the tongue, again from the honey, liked you poured honey on bread crust,very light in body, actually enjoyable to drink,like a stepped down Helles bock","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"
1879,"2010-01-17",3.6,"Pale gold, dense white head with a sticky lacing. Aroma of fresh bread dough with a floral hop edge to it. Flavor-wise, floral and fresh-mown grass hops aromatics are at the front, which harmonize with the alcohol content for a very zesty flavor. The bready malts found on the nose develop more towards the finish. Warming, lively palate.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","noncaloric"
1879,"2010-01-16",3.8,"hints of honey on the nose.  not too overpowering.  my first thought after tasting this beer...lager!  sweet.  well balanced.","USA","tjranum"
1879,"2010-01-16",3.4,"Brand-spankin new off the shelf.  Pours straw-colored with a creamy white head that dissipates quickly.  Very clear.  Not much of a nose - light malts with a little sweetness.  Definately a decent malty taste up front with a decent background honey flavor.  Showcases this flavor much better than another Wisconsin honey beer that shall remain unnamed.  Crisp with low to medium body.  Mild hop flavor on the finish.  Very good and refreshing, just not anything outlandish.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
1879,"2010-01-16",3.5,"Bottled.  Poured crystal-clear lighter golden with a short cap of white head.  The aroma picked up sweet hay, biscuits, and honey with a deeper earthy and black peppery character.. the honey really rounds it off nicely.  The flavor had a tangy, yeasty opening impression with sweet honey rolling onto the middle.. pale malts and something corn-like down there too.. mild bitterness in the form of earth and faint fruit.. finished sweet with more honey and dusty yeast.  Light-medium bodied with moderate-plus carbonation that worked well here.. fairly crisp feel.. very easy drinkin.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1879,"2010-01-16",3.5,"Bottle picked up from the brewery on a Golden Ale run - Pours a nice light amber with a massive frothy cream head. Nose is all malt and barley, real fresh and pungent. Theres almost a melon frutiness thats intermingling with some faint hops to make some light sourness. Was a bit sweet initially, but that faded pretty quick. Oh man...the honey is right there on the first sip, and then transitions into the barley with apple and grape notes. Just a hint of herbal hops on the finish. Sweet, but not overbearing by any means, and with some nice boozy notes that warm rather than bite. The carbonation is dialed up too much, but the light body makes this really easy to drink. This one grew on me as I got through the bottle.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
1879,"2010-01-15",3.7,"Seems to me the first time NG made Cabin Fever it was a belgian style ale. Thats ok, Ill take another bock. Clear light golden color with a moderate off-white head. Clean aromas, with honey, pale malt, and hint of alcohol (akin to a malt liquor). Pure malt sweetness from the first touch of the lips. LIght honey and hints of alcohol. Light floral hops. Thicker feel with just enough zip to help it across the palate. Strong malt goodness.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
