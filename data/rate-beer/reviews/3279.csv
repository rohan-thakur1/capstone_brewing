3279,"2013-10-30",3.6,"Rigor Mortis Triple servie en cask à 1,7 volumes, par bonbonne de CO2 à 2,7 volumes et issue dune refermentation en fût à 3,0. Dans les trois verres, la même robe dorée foncée qui supporte un anneau de mousse plutôt élargi. Au nez, jobserve lexplosion doranges, de bananes et de fruits du verger. Je sens se lover autour de ces derniers parfums un alcool habilement floral. Quant à la base maltée, elle a tout un coffre : on peut aisément voir ses poignées damour à la belge et ses attributs mielleux. Je nidentifie aucune épice en particulier : ce style est quelque fois intéressant lorsquil cherche à éviter cette voie. En bouche, je goûte à trois liquides qui portent les mêmes saveurs fruitées et pratiquement la même charge sucrée. Ceci dit, avec ses bulles plus vives, la version à 3,0 me semble modérer, de légère façon, la douceur du liquide. Sur les papilles, lalcool prend une place importante. Une chaleur sinstalle à chaque gorgée. Les houblons me semblent plus aromatiques quamers. Jaurais aimé une amertume plus franche pour venir embêter un peu la force des sucres maltés. Au palais, la version cask a une texture qui tapisse lintérieur de ma bouche. La version à 2,7 volumes possède aussi un bon corps mais sa texture qui est huileuse nest pas aussi tentaculaire que la version précédente. La dernière version, soit la version à 3,0, est celle que je préfère au palais. Sensiblement plus aérienne, je trouve que son pétillement, légèrement plus relevé, rend lappareil beaucoup plus digeste. Je ne note aucune grande différence lors de la finale. Elle est, dans chacune des trois verres, longue et capiteuse, maltée et amer par la combinaison, il me semble de son alcool et de ses levures. Tout compte fait, une expérience inattendue avec mon ami rodenbach99, très agréable, mais à mille lieux dune démarche scientifique, entre les effluves dune succulente pizza et les rires de deux gars de 40 ans qui simaginent encore en avoir 20.

Slightly hazy golden amber with a foamy white head displaying excellent retention and lace. Yeasty aroma, vaguely fruity and spicy. Semi-sweet palate with flavours of berries, citrus, bready-yeast, and sweet spices. Surprisingly light mouthfeel for the alcohol content.

This May 2007 batch was announced at 8% (lower than the 10% ratebeer entry) and the alcohol could be felt.  Nose was very shy and the flavour spectrum was very simple to say the least.  Some orange and citrus and a medium-high sweetness level.  Hops barely made their presence felt.  Medium body with a soft carbonation.  This batch is a below average Tripel but I know this beer has beer better in the past.

Lovely Tripel aroma - strong alcohol, malt, tons of spice, hint of coriander and a candy sweetness.  Assertive.  Strong taste - lots of malt, yet medium bodied without being syrupy (tough to do at this alcohol).  Lovely kick of spice and alcohol that never burns.  Quite simply one of the finest tripels I have ever had - holds its own with any world class tripel.

I taste just like berry, cherry...I habituelly hate those kind of beer, but not in this case since you can still feel that its a beer.

Fairly pronounced alcohol flavour and heat.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","dhurtubise"
