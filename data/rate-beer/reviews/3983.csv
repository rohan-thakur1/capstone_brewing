3983,"2016-02-09",4.1,"A citrusy take on an already pretty novel style.

3983,"2015-11-21",3.9,"Bottle. Moderate aromas of dark bread and coffee for the malt, resin for the hops, earth for the yeast, with background notes of tar, wood, tobacco and a hint of whiskey. Head is small, frothy, light tan, with some spots of lacing and is mostly diminishing. Color is very dark brown. Flavor starts slightly sweet and lightly to moderately acidic, then finishes lightly acidic and moderately bitter. Palate is medium, watery, with a lively carbonation. Nice deep aromas and flavors in this top notch Black IPA.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"
3983,"2015-11-18",3.0,"Pours a dark chestnut brown color that appears pitch black and completely opaque in the glass without even the slightest hint if lighter color. Theres a two finger, frothy beige head that very slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Very good retention with streaks of soapy lacing coating the glass on the way down. 

Dank, earthy aroma with prominent resinous, oily hops along with grassy pine needle, a touch of citrus and a slightly smokey, dark malt backbone. Underneath the earthy hops, the smokey element of the malt bill gives off a very subtle phenolic presence but it isnt very distracting or unpleasant. Some liquid smoke and charcoal along with dark chocolate, oatmeal, robust coffee bean and sweeter, dessert-like malt character. The malts begin to overpower the hops as it warms but the nose remains complex and inviting. 

On the fuller end of medium body with slight viscosity and soft carbonation. Very dry and bitter up front with the earthy hops and charred malt flavors playing off of each other. Strong sticky, resinous hop flavor up front with grass, pine and spruce tip but its missing the subtle citrus presence found in the nose. The hops are countered by a deeply roasted dark malt backbone that is somewhat acrid and nearly burnt tasting. The smoke presence is a bit stronger than in the aroma with hints of ash, charcoal and burnt toast along with used coffee grinds, oatmeal and dark chocolate. This beer has a decent balance of hops and malt but tastes very one dimensional with a ton of tongue scraping, dry bitterness and overwhelming roast. Needs a lot more sweetness to balance things out. Overall, this isnt a terrible beer but its boring, a bit harsh and tough to drink.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Balanced to the point that Im having trouble pulling individual flavors from what Im tasting. Thats truly impressive. Very restrained. Very little bitterness. Very clean. Some berry (blue).

3983,"2014-08-05",4.5,"I poured a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 7/1/14 and cost $6 ($0.36 per ounce).

Appearance: Opaque ink black body. Sediment chunks can be seen once the bottom of the bottle is poured. Forms a very large, dark tan, foamy head which laces and retains extremely well.

Smell: Pungent nose of coffee, roasted barley and dank, resiny hops. 

Taste: Maine Beer Company produces a strong IPA called Another One which uses the exact same hops and schedule as Weez. The obvious difference being this is a black IPA or black ale or whatever you want to call it. Weez is as equally good of a beer, in my opinion, even though the taste is so much different. This brewery is known for making hop-centric beers, yet theres genuine maltiness to be found here. A strong presence of coffee, roasted barley and burnt toast lays a strong foundation for the forthcoming hops. Whats odd is that in this beer, these hops create for a darker, more earthy character rather than the lighter, cleaner, brighter fruitiness of Another One. Dank resiny bitterness complements the dark malt and coffee flavor perfectly (the herbal spice rack notes are also present, but are subtle this time). Not quite as sticky as some beers of the genre, though the hops are still strong and quite bitter. Overall, its a complex, robust, and delicious palette. 

Drinkability: The 7.2% ABV on the label might lead one to believe that this is going to be a strong, hefty beer to approach with caution. However, after one swig its clear that Maine Beer Companys Weez is remarkably light on its toe. The mouthfeel is calm and soft with a velvety texture and finish to match. There is residual bitterness on the tongue, but its quite pleasant and never cloying or drying. No alcohol presence whatsoever. A versatile brew that works as a standalone beverage, with a savory meal, or as a liquid dessert.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Rich coffee, dark chocolate and pumpernickel bread moments are emboldened by precise piney and earthy hopping, creating a somptuous Black IPA/Stout middle world.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam covers the blackness.
-There is no sense of abv in the flavor profile.
-The finish is quite roasty and coniferous.
-Mouthfeel is luxurious yet not too heavy.
-Citrus angles can be enjoyed here and there.

3983,"2014-04-20",3.8,"Dark coffee-brown beer with a medium foamy tan head that lasts. Hoppy nose of pine, fresh grapefruit, and slight hints of chocolate. Flavor is quite a bit more malty than the aroma with some rich cocoa, light coffee, and toffee pudding. This is then counterbalanced by a surprising bit of citrus hops, but they are muted significantly by the grain. So, the flavor is more mellow than expected. Unique beer with flavors that are at the same time battling each other and harmonizing. This brewery consistently produces winners.","Washington DC, USA","floydslip"

Near-medium body has too much carbonation and it fizzes up in the mouth a bit, but definitely keeps things from getting sticky.

Pours coal-like black with a brown spongey, root beer float, head leaving a lot of lace. Aroma has all citrus hops up front, even from 2 feet away. Further nose is of black patent hops and coffee, but the peachy/citrus and grassy hops lead. Very nice! Taste is of sweet caramel, some roast, oranges, bakers chocolate, lightly, and the lightly bitter, lightly salty black malts. Smooth (oatmeal?) and medium bodied.

3983,"2014-02-06",3.7,"Received in trade. Consumed Feb 6. Reviewed from notes.
The appearance has a dark brown close to black colored body with a decent two fingered white to off-white close to tan head that lasts for a good minute and a half. One ring of foam does appear but ends up sliding down into the beer.
The smell has a nice earthy and smoky and roasted bitterness in the front through the coffee, however, theres a nice pungent aroma of the citrus hops trying to come through, decent malty background.
The taste is mainly bitter through the hops and the coffee reacting and overtaking the malt presence that tried to come through in the smell. It has a somewhat dry and bitter coffee aftertaste and finish.
The palate is light - almost but more likely closer to a medium sort of body, comes off as its trying to be sessionable. Carbonation comes across like a good American Black Ale should.
Overall, for the most part, I like it, but I think Id rather look for some other Black Ales before this.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3983,"2014-02-01",3.4,"Bottled 12/31/13, drunk on 2/1/14Bottle conditioned pour produces a compact, charred-tan head that recedes to cover, leaving plentiful lace atop a dark mahogany body, moderately high clarity.Yep, smells like Maine Beer Co hop profile; fresh, fruity hops show off cherry, candied orange, lychee and ruby red grapefruit. The dark malts mask some of the strong resin/alcohol burn, but are surprisingly very masked themselves, showing off only a bit of chocolate graham cracker like maltiness. Medium strength of aroma, still some alcohol vapors that I get with all of their beers. Really like the fresh, leafy hop acids.Subdued on the dark malts, just as in the nose, with just a light, pleasant tobacco dryness and light pruniness. Base malt sweetness is well-attenuated and comforting on the palate, aided by the light but engaging carbonation. The amarillo hops are delicious, adding the fresh, green, lush citrus hoppiness, while the simcoes are a bit overbearing in their brash bitterness but add their characteristic cherry-melon-like ""sweetness"" and plenty of acidity. The cascade and centennial combine and keep the finish very citrusy, somewhat piney and somewhat more resinous than I prefer. As with most of their beers, they come off very aggressive, assertive and somewhat overdone with the combination of alcohol and acidity. Nonetheless, the quality that goes in to the actual brewing is bursting forth, even if the recipes dont really suit my tastes.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3983,"2014-01-23",4.6,"Wow, quite a beer here, one of the best BIPAs Ive had since Stones Sublimely Self Righteous. A wonderful balance between the high hop flavor of citrus and pine, and the delicious roasted coffee beans. Nice use of chocolate malts here, doesnt make it too sweet it actually enhances the roasted nature of the wheat oats. Opaque black pour into the tulip glass, tan to off white head that remains throughout. Good lacing on the glass, the aroma hits from farther away than I imagined but its so enticing my mouth began to water. Tremendous combination of Simcoe and Cascade hits you immediately, then the dark chocolate and coffee next.

3983,"2014-01-01",3.6,"In short: A highly roasted and very hoppy (citrusy piney) Black IPA. Good example of the style.
How: Bottle 500ml, consumed fresh soon after purchase.
The look: Black body topped by a medium tan head with good retention and leaving lots of lacings on the glass.
In long: Nose is unmistakably Black IPA with roast, chocolaty notes and a whole lots of citrusy and piney hops. As it is often the case with Black IPAs I found the mix of roast and hops created something a bit perfumy. In mouth the beer has a full body, a somewhat grainy texture and a very active carbonation. Taste is scorched malts, burnt black cake, notes of chocolate, an assertive hopping (citrusy & piney). High roast level contributes to a rather dry finish. Maybe a little too roasted but Im nitpicking, this is a fine Black IPA.

3983,"2013-09-13",3.8,"Left my taste buds delightfully confused...
I purchased this beer solely off recommendation by the owner of my local Packie.... the exchange went like this: Him: ""Oh, you like the Peeper and the Sculpin?"" Me: ""Yes. Very much so"". Him: ""Ok, here. You try this. But, you only buy one. Limited Supply, one per person"" Me: ""Ok"" Paid for it & left. 
Later that night, I decided to have a go at it and opened the bottle. 
Upon 1st sniff, I detected strong hints of citrus, pine, etc... Excited, I grabbed for a chilled stein, began the pour and, well, it's dark, w/a tan, creamy head. Ok. Didn't expect that (blame my preconceived notion/ignorance/label stating ""Ale""). Went in for a taste.... Chocolate. Wtf!!? Then, topping off my confusion, a bitter, coffee/espresso like finish set in that had me pondering the use of a lemon twist... 
Senses realigned and summing it up, Weez smells like a hoppy, west-coast'ish IPA; looks/tastes like a Porter/Stout; and poses a challenge to ones' senses. Yet somehow it is smooth, medium-bodied with a dry finish and overall, quite enjoyable for this beer snob trainee.

3983,"2013-06-29",3.7,"Bottle from the brewery shared with Linh, Minh and Angela. Pours a black body with thin lacing. Aroma is fresh pine hop and coffee roast. Mouthfeel is medium with notes of sweet roast, coffee and light pine. This is way closer to a roasty porter with a hop character as opposed to a black IPA. But whatever.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
3983,"2013-06-29",3.5,"Aroma of cocoa chocolate, orange, grapefruit, and slight bitter coffee. Pours black with a huge sticky brown head. Taste is a mixed bag. It tastes like a really good chocolate porter was dumped into a so-so IPA. Each one is fighting with with each other. Chocolate, cocoa, olive, citrus and a peanut butter finish (even though theres no peanut butter).","Marlton, New Jersey, USA","Jesterdeal"
3983,"2013-06-27",3.8,"Bottle (500 ml). Black with a medium creamy beige head and good lacing. Aroma of roasted malt, resinous, tropical fruits and caramel. Taste is slightly sweet with roasted malt, pine, tropical fruits, caramel and a light bitter finish. Medium body. Slightly dry. Average carbonation. Good Black IPA. A tad watery on the finish, but well balanced and drinkable aplenty. I preferred Another One though.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3983,"2013-06-26",3.5,"Dark brown body, medium off-white head, spotty lacing. Pine, citrus, roast, a little earth and chocolate. Medium bodied, moderate bitterness, moderate carbonation, slight awkward finish as the malt and hops try to work things out with each other.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
3983,"2013-06-23",3.7,"Bottled June 11, 2013.
Appearance: The body is an opaque black with a tall tan head that has great retention and leaves lots of lacing as it dissipates into a thick rocky coating.
Aroma: The aroma is complex. Im getting aromas of oranges, pine, mango, cocoa and earthy hints. Very nice.
Taste: Well this is odd, there is a complex layering of flavor with a good intensity, yet it tastes muted at the same time. The base is a bit thin, though not watery, just lacking in much character. Deep chocolate and charred roasted notes overlie the thin base along with grapefruit and pine that match them in intensity. The bitterness is moderate.
Palate: A bit thin, though average viscosity, with moderate carbonation.
Overall: If this had a beefier malt base then I would enjoy this a lot more. This drink a bit thin and the specialty malts and hops really stand on their own. Thats a shame really because this is one of the few black IPAs I enjoy the clash of flavors in.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"
3983,"2013-06-23",4.3,"The beer pours like black mocha coffee with a beautiful head of medium sized, khaki colored, medium sized bubbles that sit above two finger widths in the glass and take their time in calming down. The head leaves a lacing of fat, thick bubbles that fluff out into the glass. In body the beer is impenetrable the eye. On the nose the beer smells gorgeously fruity with citric tangerine and nectarine with a touch of pine. In the roast, the beer is light with caramel and a faint touch of roasted chocolate. On the tongue, the beer tastes of citric bitter with a light sweet roast that draws a little bitterness from it and builds in the mouth. The beer also has a light acidic pop, presumably from the hops, which leaves the mouth with a wet scrim of saliva. This beer begins as sweet, however, and slowly works towards a more bitter palate, which is wonderfully encouraging of future sips. In flavor, the beer begins as fruity hops, with sweet orange and grapefruit citrus touching the tongue before a healthy roast of coffee and light char moves in and overrides those flavors. Chocolate and light metallic flavors also tingle on the tongue with the roast. The finish returns to fresh citric juice with a touch of roasted malts, and the aftertaste is of lightly roasted malts with a soft touch of metallic flavoring. On the mouth, the beer feels medium in body with a little bit of weight. The carbonation is creamy and smooth, providing just a kiss of fierceness making the beer wonderfully clean and crisp on the mouth. The mouth is left with a nice bit of saliva to cancel out the acids, and a slight bitter bite on the tongue. Overall, this is a beautifully complex beer. It sits somewhere between a hoppy porter and an India Black Ale, with a beautiful nose of citric hops and tastes nicely roasty with a good juicy bite from the hops. Color me impressed by this beer. It is sweet on the front and bitter on the end. I wouldnt call it a Black IPA by any stretch of the imagination, and I will continue arguing for some differentiation between India Dark Ales and their roastier cousins (Weez sides more on the roasty cousin side). This beer is great though, and is another success from the MBC. Try this beer.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"
3983,"2013-06-23",3.6,"Pours a solid black color with a huge tan head that persists forever. Earthy hoppy aroma with a roasty chocolate some dark fruit and a hint of cardboard. The flavor is earthy and citrus hoppy with a fair amount of dark chocolate and roasted coffee. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a slick roasty gritty mouthfeel. Nice hoppy porter very tasty.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"
3983,"2013-06-22",3.5,"50cl bottle pours a translucent, mahogany, basically black with some clumpy head that is both white and beige, mixed. Nose of chocolate, cupcakes, dried orange peel, toast, light licorice. Flavor is meaty, malty, toast, coffee grounds, some orange peel, light smoke. Medium bodied, dry finish.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
3983,"2013-06-22",2.5,"Bottle less than two weeks old. The aroma is very hoppy with earth and spice notes rounded out with some a little floral bouquet and tropical fruit. Theres a good amount of roast. It is very fresh and full all around. The flavor is bitter earthy spicy roasty but well balanced with softer malts and a dark chocolate finish.. The feel is very dynamic soft and a bit drying. Super awesome black IPA. Doesnt suffer the imbalance most of then do.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","bmerz"
3983,"2013-06-21",3.8,"Bottle with Frank and Barry. Pours dark brown with light to medium head, good lacing. Aromas are tropical hops, roasty dark malt, light chocolate, pine. Taste is peanuts, citrus hops, char, minerals. Nice beer but more ""another one"" would have been a better idea. Roasty malts are just played, make it a hoppy porter or just stick to dank pales and single ipas.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3983,"2013-06-18",3.5,"Pours a deep burnt umber with a finger of thick sticky khaki foam. Lots of roasted chocolate, pine, citrus, grass and coffee in the finish. Overall a nice beer with a pretty silky mouthfeel. Easy to drink just a bit underwhelming.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"
3983,"2012-11-07",4.2,"Draft.  Completely black color, brown head.  When I picked this one up and sniffed it, I thought I had picked up an IPA that was sitting right next to it, lots of fresh pine needles and cut grass.  Taste was chocolate covered pine boughs dipped in espresso.  Delicious.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3983,"2012-11-07",4.3,"UPDATED: JUN 19, 2013 Draft at Churchkey. Beautiful black pour with a medium-sized off-white head. Nose and flavor are fully rife with earthen loam and rich pine and spruce bitterness, hints of pink grapefruit and lemon rind, and beautiful chocolate and roasty bitterness. Smooth and flavorful throughout the taste. Not quite as vibrant as my favorites of the style (Shaun Hill), but thats a tall order, and this is an outstanding brew.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
