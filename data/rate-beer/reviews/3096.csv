3096,"2015-11-16",4.0,"Take out draft from CBM Koenji. Deep, rich brown with a small, half-finger of cappuccino-colored head. Nice light smoked bacon nose with some cacao, roasted malt and toasted caramel. Full body with a rich and creamy mouthfeel. Alcohol is well-hidden with medium carbonation. Nice creamy, rich finish that lingers. Wonderful beer.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"

3096,"2014-12-04",4.1,"I was happy to find this still in stock(or restocked) at Yamaoka and picked up a bottle. 7% Served in my new stein for that authentic rauchbier experience. Big fluffy beige head, fantastic staying power and lacing on it. HUGE smokey nose, smoked ham, maple and malty sweet goodness. Medium bodied with a smooth & slick mouthfeel. The taste is nutty, smokey, chewy dark malts, honey glazed smoked ham. This shit is GOOD.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
3096,"2014-02-06",4.4,"I recently had the opportunity to try this beer at the Furusato Matsuri event held inside Tokyo dome for over a week (in Tokyo). There were perhaps 8-10 micro-breweries flogging their brews and maybe a couple of mainstream breweries were also there. 
This beer has a nice peppery texture because of the smaller but not weaker bubbles. The smoke taste is enough to be interesting but not too strong to make you forget you are drinking beer. Im not a professional beer taster, but I would definitely buy this beer!","JAPAN","TokyoKurz"
3096,"2013-04-16",3.8,"Draft. Dark amber brown color, small tan head. Aroma of charred Hershey bar and burnt coffee taste is subtle smoke, cocoa, licorice. Nice.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"

3096,"2010-01-04",3.4,"Bottle brought back from Japan by Dominic. Pours deep, deep brown, brown head. Big smoky aroma, nice vanilla underneath. Flavour is smoky with a good malt flavour, but a thin body. Overall a very nice Rauchbier.","Wellington, New Zealand, NEW ZEALAND","donfardz64"
3096,"2009-12-27",3.4,"A sweetish rauch, perhaps a bit too fizzy but very well made. Dry ashy aroma like a house fire with a few bacon rashers crackling in the embers. Im giving the palate the benefit of the doubt as the bottle was fresh off a plane and may have settled in a day or two. As it was, the carbonation seemed a little too grabby for the style. Flavourwise, it was all toffees and bacon. I prefer a drier style of base beer in a rauch but Im glad to have tried this. (RateBeer Sydney Xmas 2009 gathering under the harbour bridge. Bottle courtesy of TimE - thanks buddy)","Blue Mountains, AUSTRALIA","highlandlad"
3096,"2009-12-23",3.7,"Bottle. Pours dark brown with lasting tanned head. Big smoky malt aroma which was a nice surprise. This is what I expected from the Redoak rauchbier the day before but was let down. But Im not disappointed with the Fujizakura Rauchbock. The smoke really lingers throughout the beer with hints of wood. Underlying caramel and toffeeish malts also add support. Quite smooth and bloody delicious. A waft of smoke in the finish for good measure. (RateBeer Sydney Xmas Gathering 2009 - cheers TimE!)","Boomtown!, AUSTRALIA","nate2g"
3096,"2009-12-13",4.2,"Smoke is present in nose but not overpowering.  Taste of smoke, burnt malt and alcohol. Great stuff.","JAPAN","kabutomushi"
3096,"2009-05-24",3.5,"Draught at the brewpub.  Very dark brown, small head. Smokey caramelly nose. Medium-full bodied. Lots of woody smoke together with caramel and some light chocolate that goes well with the smoke. Low bitterness.","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
3096,"2009-05-12",4.3,"The brewmaster brought out a keg of this when the RBJG group showed up.  Absolutely stunning beer.  Roasted, smokey, chocolate, caramel, bread dough, and light dark fruits.  Full bodied and smooth.  I quickly wen through my other beers so I could try more of this.  An gem of a beer.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
3096,"2008-10-28",3.0,"From the bottle. Poured a dark deep brown colour with a dark tan head. Smell was of roasted weiner dogs...seriously...all I could smell was hot dogs on this. This is a smooth, malty creamy brew that brings out some chocolate raspberry flavours among the smoke. Kind of a strange beer that I cannot quite find my way through. Seems balanced and interesting, but an aquired taste. Would like to try on tap to re-evaluate.","JAPAN","buzzoven"
3096,"2008-10-19",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 26, 2015 Both fresh and 6 year old version. Big, brany, tawny with good balance of smoke and bitter sweet malt. Fantastic, big beer.","JAPAN","jonno"
3096,"2008-09-10",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2008 2008 Version, draught at Qbrick. Black, with a medium head. Aroma of smoked salmon or bacon, with caramel malts underneath. Smoke flavor, going to big caramel malts, to a dry, bitter, surprisingly hoppy finish. Chewy and thick. Very clean finish, though, not at all cloying or over-sweet. Fantastic. 

2007 version: bottle from Yamaoka. 
Almost black, with a tall fine tan head. Light to medium smoked aroma, very malty, slight caramel, a bit sweet. A little bit fruity. Lightly smoked flavor, sweetish, rich malt, excellent balance. Caramel, chocolate, a touch of dark fruit. Hard to tell its strength. Less smoke than the regular. Very well balanced. Excellent! (7/5/9/5/17)","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
3096,"2008-06-03",4.1,"Bottle, thanks to Bill, leftover from the World Beer Cup.  Shared with my girlfriend Cyn, super cool label, and a smoked, and she likes smoked.  Pours dark brown/tan with a tan foamy head.  Nose is incredibly smoky with hints of cedar, and beef jerky.  Very smoky up front but not obliterating, in my opinion a good balance of smoke and other flavors Ill agree with Tim about some back end fruit flavors.  Extremely smooth and very very tasty.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
3096,"2007-11-01",3.6,"Very odd beer that might be a mix of a couple of their beers. Extremely dark brown color. Very slightly sour nose, but almost no smell. Where is the smoke??? I was very confused at the start.  Then the sip.... BAM a huge smoke whallop hits you. Smooth. Beyond the smoke there are bananas, cloves, liquorice and chocolate. Excellent. Finishes like a Wiezenbock. Even after the beer warmed up the nose was totally muted. Still overall very enjoyable.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"
