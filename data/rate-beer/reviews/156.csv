156,"2017-04-23",4.3,"From a growler purchased a week ago for consumption 04.23.2017. Brown-black in color, and what head develops dissipates to a ring. This may be due in part to not being drank immediately. Strong aroma of peanut butter, and dark roasted malts as expected and presented excellently. The palate is thin, semi-dry, and has the flavoring components as represented by the aroma. Whenever DM expands their operations to distribute their beers outside their establishment, then this should be their flagship brew.","","balloonbuffoon"
156,"2017-04-13",3.6,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2017 Crowler filled 4/11 from brewery, pours a dark brown/black with a medium light tan head. Smells like peanut butter cup cereal. Aroma of peanut butter, chocolate, and vanilla wafers. Taste is similar to aroma, peanut butter and vanilla wafers, chocolate malt, light roasted and a dry bitterness on the finish. Its decent, cant beat that aroma, but it doesnt translate to the taste which isnt bad just not a great balance. Ok stuff.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"

156,"2016-11-25",3.9,"Pour out of crowler, thanks Dad! Dark brownish black pour with thin off white head, aroma brought notes of peanut, cocoa, roast, coffee, slight earth, hints of more chocolate. Taste was a mix of cocoa, peanut, some roast, coffee notes into a bit of earth, finishing slightly roasted. Pretty nice, wish it was a bit thicker but overall very tasty and balanced.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
156,"2016-11-10",4.2,"32 oz canned crowler from Hoff. Thanks. Pours an opaque dark brown color with a medium tan head that soon recedes to a fine film. Aroma is big and bold with chocolates, mocha, vanilla and peanut butter. Taste mirrors the aroma with lots of PB set nicely in a chocolate base, there is a bitter undercurrent of black walnuts too. The palate is medium and the carbonation soft. Finishes long. Overall--Perhaps the best peanut butter beer I have ever tried, very nice--me like. Paired quite nicely with a Snickers candy bar.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"
156,"2016-11-08",4.1,"Black pour with a thin creamy tan head. Nose is bready peanut with a touch of cocoa. Crisp flavor with a lot of dry peanut tones and a fun little roasted malt and cocoa tone to balance. Still lots of peanut but its actually kinda fun and delicious.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

156,"2016-10-28",3.9,"Crowler from Hoff. Thanks man! Nose is literally that Reeses peanut butter crunch cereal. Cool aroma. Love it. Pours more or less black with a thin oily head, interesting oily legs. Flavor is liquod Reeses peanut butter crunch cereal. Pretty delicious. Almost a little oily, body is slightly thin. I can imagine this would be pretty damn awesome imperialized. Really cool enjoyable beer that I would drink again.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
156,"2016-10-01",3.8,"(crowler) Pours black with a large tan head that quickly dissipates to just a thin film. Aroma smells exactly like Reeses puffs cereal with a stronger undercurrent of chocolate. Also getting faint whiffs of PB&J along with burnt marshmallow. Flavor contains a flash of dark fruit and chocolate before quickly transitioning to a long and lasting peanut butter finish. The Reeses Puffs presence is still strong here, and the peanut butter is so pronounced that the palate feels somewhat oily. Mouthfeel is medium and carbonation is soft and appropriate for the style. It is as advertised.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
156,"2016-09-22",4.2,"Pours black with a thick mocha head. Aroma is loaded with peanuts...more like real peanuts than peanut butter...some pb does peek through...like a pb M&M. Flavor is roasty and almost burnt with roastiness and turns to faint bitter dark chocolate and an underlying pb that build towards the finish. Mouthfeel is medium and very creamy with a dry pb/roasty finish...more roasty than pb.","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"

156,"2015-12-13",3.9,"32 oz crowler courtesy of deyholla. Thanks a bunch, buddy. Pours a deeper blackish brown hue into the glass, a firmer haziness, darker middle with subtle ruby brownish toasty glow onto the edges and bottom. Decent frothy tannish head atop is a subtle layer atop, thicker ringer on the edges with some nice enough lacing. Toasty and roasty body shows jabs of cocoa, coffee roast and peanut butter nuttiness. Peanut butter cup appeal without being overbearing or sweet, semi sweet chocolate bitter and darker life. Pleasant, a touch sweet and caramel biscuity feel into the fold. Initial is medium bodied, a bit lighter with distinct toasty and nougat appeal. Nutty bars, wafers and biscuity malts meet chocolate, some cocoa pebbles and that nice blend of peanut butter and cocoa. A thinner body makes this pretty crushable, nice semi sweet qualities, toasty and roasty meet that bitterness, dry edge onto the backend and finish. Really nice nutty bar appeal, llighter body, toasty and nutty, dry and roasty, cocoa nibs and coffee, nougat appeal. Overall, this is pretty quality stuff. A light enough body and not sweet or sticky, this one goes down easy. A nice nutty nougaty toasty appeal, cocoa nib bitterness, coffee with nutty caramel and carmelized malts. Bitter coffee and nib. This is quality. A nice pour, really nice nose and really good flow. Darker, lighter on the palate with firmer roasty toast, nuttiness and bitter appeal. Really dang nice. A touch lighter on the carbonation but the lightness of the body here allows it to be much more drinkable overall.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

156,"2015-10-29",3.8,"Black, mahogany edged pour with a thin mocha foam lining the arc of the glass. Sumptuous, peanut butter cookie aroma framed in roasted malt and caramel. Warm and savory, sweet but earthy enough for good balance. the dark malts occasionally produce a burst of prune-like acidity, and thats as much detail as this peanut-rich aroma really needs. The flavor is more traditional porter than full on umami-oriented dessert, as the aroma would portend; some alkaline soil bitterness, ashy malt, light lactic tang, in addition to the softer presence of peanut butter. This is the rare situation in which it seems certain that more malt sugar and a higher alcohol content would be beneficial; this said, the palate is adequately smooth and deceivingly rich, not sharp or acidic. Coffee grounds, peanut, and a little hint of black cherry in a rambling, likeable finish. Recipe qualms aside, this is really enjoyable.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
156,"2015-10-23",3.9,"On tap at Dangerous Man. Wow, the aroma on this beer is incredible - delicious peanut butter and a bit of a biscuity wafer note, like a Coffee Crisp bar or something. Flavour is a lot lighter but some peanut butter does come through; a little roasty and a little sweet, light bodied and nutty. Really nice.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","ljthiessen"
156,"2015-09-17",4.5,"For my first rating, Ill rate one of my favorite beers Ive ever had. Ive been thinking about this beer since the first time I tasted it about a month ago. Nutty aroma that you can smell from at least a foot away. Its easy to drink but complex enough that its not boring. Im not always a huge fan of porters, but this one is particularly interesting and easy to drink. Doesnt feel particularly heavy.","","Sonjeroo"
156,"2015-08-31",3.0,"I wasnt anywhere near as enthused about this as others I talked to were. It has a GREAT, great nose...truly, a nose to rise above others.

156,"2015-06-18",4.1,"10 oz. pour, on tap at the brewerys taproom in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Consumed on 6-17-15. Pours a very dark brown with a moderate amount of short-lasting, beige head. Long-lasting but sporadic lacing. Strong and good aroma features scents of peanut butter cup, peanut butter sandwich, and, especially, peanut butter cookie with chocolate chips. Excellent, baked dessert-like smell. The flavor mimics the aroma but includes additional components. Theres a dry tang in the start and a good, roasted maltiness, especially in the finish. Chocolate peanut butter candy bar. Even a slight, woodfire roastiness. The malt base of this beer is quite likable and would be notably good even without the peanut butter, but the peanut butter does enhance it. Quite tasty, borderline delicious. Like many other beers from this brewery, it improves upon multiple sips. Good, dry, roasted bitter aftertaste. In fact, its one of the best aftertastes I ever have experienced, which raises my score for the otherwise very good palate to a 5. Lively in the palate. Easy to drink. Very good palate effects. Overall, this is a well above average beer, perhaps even a special one. Great job by Dangerous Man! This beer helps it hold onto its claim as one of the best breweries in Minnesota. One of Dangerous Mans best beers yet. I am quite impressed.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
