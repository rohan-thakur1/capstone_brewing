2116,"2015-10-28",4.0,"Didnt know this was added as a seperate entry. Tried multiple times on tap, hazy straw golden color with small to medium white head that sticks around. Notes are grass, lemon, sour diesel, and other lady gray notes which I love. Has a bit of lemongrass and pepper funk to her as well. Light to medium body with average carbonation. Excellent","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
2116,"2015-10-15",3.6,"Draught at Armsby Abbey, 8/16/15.Didnt realize there were two versions until the bartender mentioned this was Lady Grey tea.Otherwise, a bit of haze throughout the pale, golden liquid with a white head topping it showing moderate retention (tea oils must be knocking it down a bit).I dont think Id guess tea based on the nose, though theres certainly some light earthiness and a hint of spice going on. Minimal citrus, light fruitiness and plentiful dough and grain are the main focus of the nose. Fresh, charming yeast with no alcohol or flaws.Finally do get the tea coming through. I had no idea it was there in the Earl Grey version, but this one, at least if youre looking for it, is there. Dosent really complement or change the beer too much. Just adds a touch of light tea astringency, a bit of bergamot. Citrus is by far the most prominent note, with some sweetness coming on strong towards the finish. Vanilla, dough, grain, herbs/spices and lingering biterness from the hops. Creamy, very supple texture with low to moderate carbonation and no alcohol or flaw.  The doughy/sweet flavors bog this down a bit and while perhaps they wanted to make sure the tea didnt dominate, I think it went a little too far.  Needs more dryness/crispness.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

>>> A clean and heavily drinkable well hopped low abv quencher from Hill Farmstead that is - from what I can remember - a bit more floral than the Earl Grey version.

-  Hazy straw color with a medium fully lasting white head leaving some nice lacing. 
-  Aroma is well hopped but also delicate with citrus, leafy hops, mild piney notes, mild earthy notes and some floral tea features. 
-  Tea and floral presence are more present in taste while all other flavors are still there, but toned down. 
-  Body is light. Good carbonation. Dry and floral finish with some mineral notes. 
-  Clean and easy drinking. Another great quencher from HF. 
-  From what I remember from the Earl Grey version, this is a little more floral (and even almost perfumy at times) and therefore a bit less drinkable for me, but only in comparison to Works of Love b1 which is still ranked very high among my low abv favorites. 

Flavors:  Citrus, leafy hops, floral, perfumy notes, mild resin, mineral notes.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2116,"2015-09-20",3.7,"Keg at Whetstone. Pours clear yellow with a creamy white head. The nose holds baked hay, lemon zest, pine needles. Light sweet flavor with some hints of vanilla, lady grey tea, pale bread, straw. Light bodied with fine carbonation. Finishes with some hitter straw, light dough, wheat, hay, lemon peel, more tea. Tasty beer.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

2116,"2015-09-13",3.9,"Draft, A very hazy yellow. 2 finger head with tight bubbles. The aroma is very similar to brother Earl. Tea is present, wheat and America hops. Well, this appears to have even more tea than earl grey. Some sort of saffron, tea, nutmeg, black pepper thing going on. Low abv and the malts are well integrated. Slight sweetness at the finish. Good stuff","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
