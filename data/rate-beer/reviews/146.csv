146,"2015-12-03",4.2,"Dun beau ambré lumineux, le liquide est visqueux et glissant. Ça sent les pommes en dessert avec de subtils épices qui semble être de la muscade, de la cannelle, du girofle et de la vanille. Cest sublime en bouche. Les pommes sont accompagnées de caramel et sont acides et juteuses. Un plaisir gustatif évident. (1653-061214)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","AlainG"

146,"2015-05-22",4.0,"2 oz sample from bottle (200 ml) bought @ Cidrerie Cryo. 

Appearance: Clear deep golden-orange with sticky legs. 

Aroma: Caramelized apples, toffee, alcohol, cinnamon, toffee, honey and hints of ginger.

Taste: Quite sweet and a bit boozy. Caramelized apples, alcohol, toffee, light acidity, cinnamon notes and hints of honey. 

Palate: Full body. Thick, chewy and syrupy mouthfeel. Warming finish. Mild spicy aftertaste. Lingering caramelized apples sweetness.

Overall: My favorite Cryo ice cider so far. Its more complex than Cryo de Glace and Tête de Cuvée, but like the two others it could use a bit of rounding on the edges as its a tad too boozy to be among the best of the style. I would love to try the - extremely limited - oak aged version of this one as Im pretty sure it gives some spectacular results. Very tasty.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

Overripe apple (not oxidized, just ... tangy) - acidic, alcohol - taste follows, a little blush sweetish wine in the mix - slick, not too sweet, solid acidic finish, well-balanced -  in the upper range of ice ciders.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
146,"2011-08-17",4.0,"Bottle thanks to HogTownHarry. This was amazing! Still dont really get it, but wow it tasted good. Pours thick orange. Smells quite boozy, but is so smooth. brandy apple is the best way i can describe it.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","ndon"
146,"2011-08-16",4.7,"A Mes rate. Bottle thanks a million to HogTownHarry.My god. This is ridiculously good. I always struggle to rate ice ciders. Theyre all sweet, full bodied and adorable. This excells at all three. The aroma is best described in one word. DEEP. The flavour is ecstatic. Phenominally sweet but not at all cloying. Very slight sherbetty fling in the middle gives way to an amazing slap in the face of kiwi, strawberry and some late late apricot. All killed to death by Guatemalan insanity apples. My god. Stupendously good stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

146,"2011-06-16",4.3,"2008 bottle, thanks Fred!  Pours a clear copper with pink/red edges, looks a lot darker than most apple ice wine.  Nose is really rich and complex, with this baked caramel apple, cloves, pear, honey.  Texture is fairly thin.  Flavor is quite sweet with a great baked apple quality, caramel.  Very focused and not overly hot.  Awesome.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
146,"2011-04-26",4.2,"Bottle This cider rocks! Clear, lovely, deep amber cider. The nose rewards me with baked apples and spice layered upon a tannic, earthy component. Full-bodied and nearly chewy. The flavor is quite sweet and super fruity - baked apple intermingled with suggestions of spicy cinnamon and clove. An earthy, tree bark nuance is present as well. Finishes uber sweet and fruity, then fades and transforms into blessed acidity. World class ice cider shipped from Canada to my front door by Glouglouburp!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

Clear deep amber in color with no head.  Apple and cinnamon nose.  The taste is ultra smooth with sweet red apple, caramel, and brown sugar flavors.  At 10% this shit is freakin dangerous.  I really really dig it.......","Florida, USA","50belair"

Taste : Light lychee and vanilla. Light caramel.

146,"2011-02-16",4.2,"Pouring at Le Mondial des Cidres Glaces.  Pours a browned golden amber.  Where the regular was bright and young the Prestige is full of soft caramel, apples, and some vinous wine notes as well.  So remarkably smooth.  The acid here is very slowly developing and gentle.
