Mildly toasted malty aroma with nutty notes, a whiff of barnyard and caramel, backed by mildly herbal and subtle citric hops. Mildly sweet and delicately bitter flavour, light to medium bodied with a smooth and well-matured carbonation. Moderately toasted malty and slightly nutty malty taste with hints of bread crusts, caramel, a whiff of chocolate, as well as herbal hoppy accents in the background, the latter getting stronger towards the lasting, mildly sweet malty and hop bitter finish.

1366,"2013-12-10",4.0,"Multiple liters vom fass at Brauerei Knoblach, Nov. 2013: Clear rusty garnet. Eggshell head fizzles away into a snug collar. Remarkably clean nose of treacle, molasses, fresh baked dark bread, roasted nuts. Woody and herbal hoppiness. Vague whiff of minerals, melanoidins and cocoa. Firm and snug carbonation. Richly toasty, starchy, and laden with chocolate-drizzled toffee notes. Ongoing toasty grip yields an edgy dryness. No esters to compete with the immaculately clean and lean malt frame. Earthy malt intricacies continually unfold, delighting with a roasted nut sharpness and fallen-leaf drying effect atop delectable hay dust textures which allow the minerals to latch onto the tongue. Breadcrusty notes abound as bouncy melanoidins sneak in and dance in unison. Hints of cookie exude as well. Muted coffee and toffee elegantly gel with the resounding earthiness. Forceful surge of nectar-laced bitterness gains more depth and sophistication as candyish notes arise alongside a biting hop-derived woodiness. Chocolate teases the tongue as it gives was to minerals, dry toast and a nearly wince-inducing punch of finishing hop bitterness. A very clean, intensely bitter, yet gloriously dry and malty landbier thats on par with their equally wonderful (and also quite bitter) lagerbier. The brewer Michael obviously has a deep adoration of hops, though unlike most American brewers, he uses them with precision (a beer CAN be insanely bitter without being one-dimensional). I am happy to have learned that Michaels teenage son is attending brewing school and always seems to be around the brewery lending a hand. Thanks to Ernest for driving us back and forth to this place, because I just couldnt get my fill of this and the lagerbier on one visit alone!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
1366,"2013-11-30",3.9,"Draft at Knoblach.
Head is initially small, frothy, off-white, mostly lasting.
Body is medium to dark brown.
Aroma is moderately malty (toasted bread/nuts, caramel, roasted grain), lightly hoppy (herbs).
Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, moderately bitter.
Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.

Kinda watery, but otherwise quite delightful...rich malt nose and surprising hop bitterness. Very clean and solid.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
1366,"2013-11-29",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2015 Draft at the brewery. Chestnut brown body, clear with a fine white head. Crusty bread / toast malt in the nose with some grassy / herbal hops which show up as a strong green bitterness in the finish, out of balance bitterness even, which is strange to find in Franconia. Lingering bitterness, how did this become a staple here? Leafy green herbalness. Cookie and toast and grassy hops, a fun one for sure, though Ive had bad versions which are more simplr cola-malt oriented but my friends seemed to enjoy more.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

1366,"2011-08-01",4.0,"My Bottom Line :  
Hazelnut-laced toasted malts converse with spicy, wooden hops in this slender and refined Dunkel. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A slice of foam decorates the deep copper. 
-The tiny but active bubbles and lean sugars craft a sturdy mouthfeel.
-The hoppy finish is quite bitter, more intense than the average Franconian brew. 
-This and their Ungespundet Lagerbier are both brews I would drink pints of all the time if I could visit Schammelsdorf regularly.
