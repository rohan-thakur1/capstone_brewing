4581,"2017-06-21",3.4,"Pours a cloudy light orange with a good, dense and persistent white head. Nice lacing. Aroma has a delicate dough and/or white bread base, overcome by fruity notes (expecially citric, but also peach) and spiciness. Taste follows the aroma closely, with high sweetness (maybe a little on the high end even for the style), a slight hint of refreshing tartness and close to no bitterness. Quite on the verge of too sweet, but still ok. Light bodied with quite high carbonation to bring a slightly creamy but still easy mouthfeel. Overall enjoyable and quite refreshing.","ITALY","ozzatoadisback"

4581,"2017-02-22",2.5,"Gekocht bij Dranken Maes in Dendermonde op 10-10-2016. En geproefd op 24-12-2016. St. Bernardus Wit heeft een strogele kleur en ziet er wat wazig uit. Bij het uitschenken produceert het een normale hoeveelheid wit schuim in een gelijkmatige laag die zeer vlug neerslaat, het bieroppervlak wordt vlug helemaal vrij van schuim. Ook zwak wandklevend. Toch een middelmatige pareling te zien met middelmatig grootte belletjes. St. Bernardus Wit heeft een licht zurig aroma, ook fruitig met groene appel, citrus en perzik. Er is ook veel koriander in waar te nemen. De smaak is zoetig en licht zurig, de citrus en de koriander komen er ook in weer. In de mond is St. Bernardus Wit slechts medium volmondig, is hij niet droog maar geeft het koolzuurgas een te overheersende prikkeling, St. Bernardus Wit is wel volmondig van textuur, een eerder complex biertje. De nasmaak vloeit bijna niet uit is zoetig en heeft een zeer lichte zure toets, ook een wat lichte kruidige afdronk. Goed maar wat te prikkelend en geen volle smaak, wat een verschil met hun St-Bernardus Tokio.","Dendermonde, BELGIUM","RudiGR"
4581,"2017-02-20",4.8,"Aroma is fresh and has citrus, banana, tropical fruit and some alcohol. Color is like bright and cloudy apple juice and theres a good amount of carbonation/foam (also when pouring). Taste starts with a slightly sour apple cider like taste with a refreshing, dense carbonation and some citrus notes. Very fresh. There are also light wheat beer and ale undernotes that add some depth or body, but which are not overpowering. Palate is slightly oily, but not too much and the beer has a really fine, nice carbonated feel. I really like the apple cider taste in this since this sort of combines the sensations of drinking beer and drinking apple cider. It even has a sparkling wine or champagne feel to it. The inspiration from Hoegaarden can be sensed in this beer. An excellent beer from St, Bernardus again.","Jyväskylä, FINLAND","mviljamaa"
4581,"2017-02-14",4.2,"Bottle, 330 ml. Pours VERY cloudy dark yellow/gold with a one finger fairly dense, long retaining head. Lacing is thick. Has an almost milky, white chocolate-y look to it, sometimes even with a dash of darker caramel colour; real pretty! Aroma-wise, theres loads of coriander, other herbs, a bit of clove, some really rich and prominent creamy/dairy notes, lemon and orange zest/peel, some spicy hops, rounded off with a touch of phenol and musty yeast. Must emphasise how rich and full this aroma is, with a brilliant balance between the thick creamy/dairy notes and the spicy, yeasty tangy stuff. The spice cuts through first in the taste, attacking the sides of the tongue before the fairly strong lemon zest, coriander, and creamy stuff (a little sweet) kick in. Mildly sour throughout, certainly not in a bad way. The creamy/dairy notes stick around the longest and merge into lots of cereal and wheat for a fairly dry, spicy, warming finish. Theres some characteristics reminiscent of boiled white rice, spring onions, a small amount of white pepper and some earthy hops at various points. Little bit metallic which is a downside. Body is medium, texture is oily/creamy and coats the mouth quickly, carbonation is mild. Really like this one and particularly appreciate all the creamy/dairy stuff, probably my favourite of the style so far!","Kent, ENGLAND","Cybion"

Looks: Cloudy, hazy pale straw golden colour with a thick ring of dirt-like yeast sediments; Half finger head with crumpety white foam which last for 1 minute; Fair sticky lacing with active carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant malt, with very strong wheaty tartness, banana, light apple, strong orange peels, coriander, vanilla, cream, floral, sugar, spices, dough, strong Bel yeast, very light lemon and thin grass.

Taste: Close to light sweet light malt, with strong wheat, very strong tartness on the verge of acidic, strong orange peels, light coriander, strong carbo, floral, light molasses, earth, spices, light bread, strong yeast, lemon, moderate bitter hops and light strawy grass. 

Body: Close to medium body. Slick and creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: Light maltyness in a thick background. Very smooth and creamy. Lots of wheat with screaming tartness.
Good orange peels and floral but light on coriander and sweetness. Spicy and yeasty with mild lemon and notable bitterness to round. Good!

Hoppiness: Floral, spices, very light lemon and thin grass in nose. Floral, earth, spices, lemon and strawy grass in taste; Bitterness is moderate for an lasting, mid to light astringent wheaty finish.

After Taste: Fairly dry. Smooth and very easy to mouth.

<P>Comments: This one feels stronger and bolder than Van Steenberges Celis White - better estery aroma, a lot creamier, stronger wheaty tartness, stronger orange peels and spices. A bit more sweetness will be perfect to its hoppiness. Quite nice for Summer!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

4581,"2015-11-15",3.8,"It has a straw yellow color with cloudy body. A white foam of flimsy and low average training duration. Small bubbles.

Its aroma brings a first very characteristic yeast print with citrus fruit notes and subtle.

Predominant yeast flavor marks the taste in most of the tasting. It is clear the presence of well spicy notes of herbs, cloves and coriander a light at the end Bitter a light bitterness.

With a high acidity mark by a very characteristic end, strong, denoting a character marked by a beer yeast.

Its texture is velvety and with a medium-high carbonation in a lightweight body. Very refreshing and high drinkability.

The striking presence of yeast almost steals almost entirely your taste buds, however your final show is full flavored.

A few striking beer for style enthusiasts who can find it bitter, but in fact express its complexity.

A Acidity a bit steep, but does not go beyond the measure. A striking and also spicy aftertaste.

Pierwsze wrażenie to bardzo wysokie wysycenie  nie można mieć tego za złe  mieści się to w stylu, szczególnie, że piwo było refermentowane w butelce więc samoistnie nasycało się z czasem.

From possibly the best mixed six pack in existence comes this cloud straw yellow number, white billowing head greeting the moustache.

Taste is initially sour, with citrus and oranges, making room for more spices, like coriander, yeast hints. Later more sweet rounded fruits, like banana, appear, likely from esters. Ends quite dry with a lingering sourness and phenolic feel. Light to medium body, medium carbo, quite round mouthfeel despite its fresh and drinkable character.

4581,"2015-02-06",4.8,"12 oz bottle, poured into a tulip at approximately 40 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a very cloudy pale straw gold, and forms a two-finger white head that dies quickly to about half a finger, then lingers for a bit. Occasional decent-sized bubbles of carbonation can be seen rising from the bottom of the glass. While there is lacing at first, it eventually dies to small patches as the head evaporates to a broken ring.

Smell: Sour citrus mingles with an interesting sort of musty funk as the aroma wafts out of the glass. There are some faint hints of green grape and pear in the scent, a touch of spice, and something vaguely like mildewed bubblegum.

Taste: Tart citrus opens the flavor profile in a rush of orange and lemon, shot through with various spices - some clove and coriander, a touch of pepper. As it moves along the palate, notes of pear and banana appear, though beneath the citrus. The finish leaves behind the citrus flavors, with a sour and mildly funky edge to them, akin to if a sample of mold from bleu cheese were never introduced to any cheese, but made to grow on the oranges and lemons instead.

Mouthfeel: Light and drinkable, with significant sparkly, sharp carbonation.

Overall: Thats a darned good witbier, verging into sour territory just a touch while retaining the complexities of phenols and esters one would want in a wit. If I could find this for under $5 a bottle, Id make it a regular in my fridge. Even at that price, for the way this approaches the realm of a sour beer, itll make repeat appearances.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Cloudy golden yellow with a huge, foamy white head that seems to get bigger as it settles and opens up. Retention is great & there is nice lacing too.

Wheat & some light wheat and coriander with light citrus and lemon. The beer is quite sweet and fruity with a pleasant taste that is very much what Id been expecting from this one.

Smooth and light medium bodied without seeming thin or watery. There was strong carbonation to give the beer a lively and quite refreshing feel.

A nice tasting beer, that smooth and very fruity with a good, refreshing finish. It went down very well and was exactly what Ive come to expect from a good example of the style. Simple with a good balance but pulled off well.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

Pours a hazy straw yellow with a huge three finger billowy white head. The fluffy head sticky around for a long time and leaves huge clumps of lacing on the sides of the glass. This is what a wit should look like. Picture perfect.

The aroma just jumps out of the glass with lemon and coriander dominating. There are more subtle hints of clove, banana, and orange. There is a real sharpness to the aroma that I love.

The flavor brings forth tons of coriander and more orange than was present in the aroma. Fresh baked bread along with lemon provide support along with a delicate tartness on the tip of the tongue. Perfect soft wheat character along with abundant carbonation that is perfect for the style.

Overall, this is what every witbier should strive to be like. To me, this is the absolute defining beer of the style and by far the best wit I have ever had.

The beer is hazy yellow with a thick, dense white cap. Plenty of lacing is left on the snifter. The aroma brings wheat, coriander, orange peel, yeast, lemons. Delicious flavor. Slightly tart lemons, with hints of Belgian yeast and a mild spice character. Everything is integrated beautifully. Really easy to drink, full of flavor.

The fridge is full of beer and is included in the cost of staying, so drink as much or little as you wish. My wife and I had five beers between us and were told off for not having more (I hadnt the cheek to ask if I could take some home.).

Anyway my bottle of Wit was fresh and lovely. Not my favourite style by a long way, but it was in the fridge and had to be reviewed because I hadnt had it before!

Cloudy, light orange/yellowish white witha bright white head on top.

The smells in gave off reminded me of grapefruits and citrus fruits in general, coriander and wheat added to the aroma.

Tingles the tongue and a drier aftertaste. The coriander in the smell takes over in the taste, with the citrus fruits battling to compete, nice mix.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty with notes of hay and toast, lightly hoppy with notes of lemon and orange, moderately yeasty with cobwebs, soap and sweat. Notes of clove and coriander. The flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter and lightly acidic. It finishes lightly to moderatey sweet, lightly bitter and lightly to moderately acidic. Medium body with a creamy texture and lively carbonation. This wit was a lot more aromatic and flavorful than  Hoegaarden. Its fuller body and smoother texture stood out as well. I liked it better.

Sour coriander and citrus aroma with a touch of malt. Hazy yellow-orange with effervescence but no head. The flavour begins with citrus and carries a pervading peppery note that is accentuated by the elevated carbonation. Part of the sourness comes from wheat, but it seems that another aspect is from fermentation. Clean finish. Very refreshing.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

4581,"2010-04-26",4.3,"750 ml bottle poured into a pint glass 
A- Body is a very hazy, nearly opaque golden yellow hue. Pours with a 2-3 finger foamy, soapy, white head that has perfect retention at 1finger the whole way down. Small traces of lacing left behind here and there in the glass. Cloudiness is thick and uniform when held up to the light the brew is barely translucent.

S- Nose is heavy on coriander. Orange Zest can also be detected with a backbone of sweet bready yeast.

T- Flavor follows similar suit as the nose. Coriander and a hint of orange zest upfront with a healthy bready yeast backbone to balance it out. Coriander is the highlight of the finish as the other flavors fade. What lingers is a slight hint of coriander and mild bready flavors.

P- Carbonation is pretty high-which makes this otherwise perfectly sessionable beer a slow sipper. Body has a good consistency-medium weight and somewhat doughy, not in the least bit thin anywhere.

O- This is a really got witbier- one of the better examples of the style around. This one is full of flavor and a bit spicier than most of the other examples. Wonderful overall-the only thing that keeps this from being an A+ witbier in my book is the mouthfeel, which is good, but a bit over carbonated and the body could be smoother.

Im not sure I like the way this one tastes as much as I liked the way it smells some fruit is certainly there, then that lavender thing I liked about the aroma seems to be playing too much a role in the flavor here, some character of over steeped lavender tea is just constantly bugging me about this beer.

4581,"2009-07-27",4.5,"Presentation: It was poured from a 11.2oz brown bottle into a hexagonal Witbier glass.

Appearance: The body has a yellow tan color and lots of cloudy yeast making it darker than other Witbiers that I have seen. There are lots of little bits of yeast particles floating around inside as well. On top the head is thick and foamy with a creamy off white color. There is also a dusting of light brownish tan yeast on top of the head. This head has good retention and makes some nice slick lacing on the glass.

Smell: The aroma has a full nose filled with wheat, yeast, light grain and some mild hops.

Taste/Mouth: Its flavor has a good wheat malt base with clove and spice notes mixed with some citrus light, fruity/funky yeast (apple and pear notes) and mildly bitter hops. It finishes fairly dry with a touch of spicy hops over yeast notes. The palate is medium bodied with a solid texture and nice soft yet active carbonation.

Notes: This is a very tasty Witbier with a solid texture and deeply hazy appearance.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

The aroma is superior: you have the grainy smell, typical for witbier, but also fruity and light citrus which excites your nose. The taste goes with the rest of the beer: I nearly loose words to describe superlatives: a full taste, a creamy, buttery taste, also grainy (witbier), with a light citrus, light bitter aftertaste. This is a very well balanced beer, that doesnt overwhelm you, which is very remarkable, seen the light alcohol percentage.

4581,"2008-11-28",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2008 Pours a very cloudy light orange/blonde with a small, one-finger, white head. Didnt toss in all the yeast from the bottom. This literally exploded out of the bottle probably from the live yeast and refermentation. Not much in the way of lacing. Aroma is typically witbier: citrus, cloves, coriander, orange peel, plus the addition of some medium yeast notes. Taste is spot on: similar to the aroma plus some white pepper. Light and somewhat creamy on the palate. Aftertaste is dry and neutral. No warming alcohol, no hop bitterness, very light and malty. Unlike other white beers, this does not develop a soapy taste after awhile like Hoegaarden and Wittekerke .This is definitely not just the hot summers day witbier. This is a classic for all seasons. Of all the wheat beers I have tried, this is truly an outstanding exception.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Nose is bold; notes of malted wheat, coriander, orange zest, nutmeg, cardamom, some doughy yeast, and clove.  Flavor is similar with all the same complexity; malted wheat, clove, cardamom, nutmeg, light orange zest, coriander, doughy yeast, and light pear.  Palate is medium, creamy, nearly lively, and almost silky.  Finishes still mostly sweet, with lots of clove and cardamom, some malted wheat, and doughy yeast with some lingering coriander and pear.  By far my favorite Wit with so many complex flavors and sweet baking spice notes to match a nice wheat note.  Maybe not the best example of the style, but extremely drinkable and taking some Belgian pale characteristics.  Great Wit.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

She pours a beautiful cloudy straw yellow with an enormous bountiful white head that resembles a cloud floating in my brew. After a couple minutes, she settles into a rather nicely thick white head that completely covers my Wit beer below. A swirl and a sniff later, hints of banana and an explosion of clove and spices fill the nose. Sweet and yeasty aromas hold the bananas and spices in place. As I enjoy my first quaff, a thick almost chewy body carries with it a plate of delicious flavors: slightly sour yeasts, warm banana bread, spices and cloves, and some sweet fruits (peaches). Definitely a heavier body than other wit beers I have had, St. Bernardus Wit fills your mouth with her exquisite brew, but still manages to go down clean and smooth, leaving only a lingering sour yeast dryness.

I tried this beer on May 20, 2008 at ""Smokeless Joes"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The beer poured a hazy yellow orange with a finger-thick white head that lasted throughout.  The aroma was yeast, malt, and spicy sweetness.  The mouthfeel was medium bodied and highly carbonated, almost sparkling.  The flavour was wheat, yeast, and some sweet malty tones.","Milton, Ontario, CANADA","cyrenaica"
4581,"2008-05-18",3.9,"Draft at <a href=""http://www.5thearlmarket.com/""> Earl Market in Decatur. Pours a very cloudy yellow with some notes of tan. There were a few white bubbles, but no real head (it likely faded on its way from the tap to my table). The aroma has some grassiness and mustiness, some wheat character, and a light sweetness with some spice. The flavor starts wheaty with a subtle tartness and some coriander spice. At mid-palate the beer is dry and wheaty with a subtle hop bitterness. The beer finishes dry with flavors of orange peel and spice. The mouthfeel is crisp and medium in body, and it is particularly dry at the back of the palate. Overall, a great and authentic witbier.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

The flavor is very fresh lemony to start off before the corriander and oranges hits in the middle, just to give way for a rather hop bitter end which is very nice for a witbier.

4581,"2008-03-31",4.3,"On tap at The Red in Santa Cruz. Peachy lemon in color with a big white head that leaves fantastic Belgian lacing. The foam never seems to die down to the liquid.

Aroma is spicy and citrusy: coriander and lemon respectively. Classic.

Flavor is pretty much unrivaled in the witbier world. Not a touch of wateriness yet still so refreshing. Tangy lemon with a sweet wheat maltiness, accented by coriander and clove.

Mouthfeel is unreally smooth from the wheat. A bit too full-flavored to be supremely drinkable like some of the lighter versions of the style out there, but this is quite easily the best as far as overall quality.

Tangy at first with tart citrus and light herb/spice, this gets overtaken with a raw dough and wheat taste, pungent yeasty hay notes throughout.

Taste-prickly, soft, light lotion, lavender, coriander, watery, light citrus, Alka-Seltzer (big time), orange, chamomile, mildly tart. Not bad for a lame style, but kind of thin and uninspiring. I hate to say this, but this beer would probably taste better with a wedge of lemon or orange in it. I could imagine kicking back and slowly drinking a bottle of this on the back yards while eating oranges or dunking orange slices into it.  VERY Alka-Seltzer like.","Carrollton, Texas, USA","Lumpy"

4581,"2007-10-11",3.7,"11-Oct-07 (750 ml corked and caged bottle: Purchased 08-Aug-07 for $6.99 at the Pizza Port Bottle Shop in Carlsbad, CA) With so many microbreweries jumping on the Witbier bandwagon these days, the truly great examples of this style really stand out.  St. Bernardus Wit shows the complexity and balance that most others lack.  Begin with a gorgeous pour where the cloudy, golden-yellow beer is capped by a tall, fluffy, foamy head that is white in color and long lasting.  Delightful aromas of sweet tropical fruits, tart orange and yellow citrus, sourdough, tart funk and a hint of herbs.  Tart lemon, tropical fruitiness, and a dash of coriander, with a wheaty and bready base that doesnt dominate the finish like so many others.  This beer is more tart than most Belgian Whites, which might turn some people off, but the tartness adds complexity and makes the beer all the more refreshing.  The beer is medium in body, heavier than some of the traditional whites like Hoegaarden, but not too heavy for the style.  Its well carbonated and somewhat burpy, but not prickly on the tongue.  The refreshing, moderate tartness remains prominent well into the finish, ensuring excellent drinkability.  While most domestic examples of this style are far too heavy on coriander, pepper, or lemon peel, this beer demonstrates perfect balance despite added complexity.  Its a wonderful, perfectly crafted beer across the board.06-Feb-06 (330 ml bottle, Best Before 03-Mar-08: $3.49 at Bottleworks in Seattle, WA) Lots going on in the flavor, much to my delight.  Wheat and yeast provide a solid, flavorful and medium-bodied base for the fruit and spices to build on.  Mildly sweet orange citrus, but balanced by a gentle tartness and slight bitterness toward the finish.  Mild coriander is present, but I notice the peppery nature more.  Well-carbonated, to the point of being burpy, a drying, winelike mouthfeel, very clean and refreshing, this beer couldnt possibly make the palate stale or tired.  The small, pockmarked, white head dissipates quickly because there isnt much head to begin with.  Pale golden-yellow and fairly cloudy in appearance.  Once again, a wit beer from Belgium that pairs beautiful complexity with superior flavor.  Very pleasant and enjoyable. (7, 3, 7, 4, 15 = 3.6)","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

4581,"2007-03-14",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Seductive coriander milkiness and flowery citrus fruit blend in perfectly with the quenching wheat and doughy yeast, a characterful union emboldened by the soft yet expansive effervescence. A complex and quaffable witbier that matches St.Bernards high standards of excellence.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-The creamy head of foam lingers beautifully atop the cloudy pale orange.
-Aroma is very seductive and perhaps more outgoing than the flavor profile, which focuses on drinkability while maintaining the same attributes.
-The finish is spicy and dry, again adding to the quaffability factor.
-Mouthfeel coats the palate, which is rather rare for the style, and appreciated.

Nice combination of flavor - wheat, lemon, orange, and some kind of dry spice. A slightly citrus hop bitterness is noticeable in the finish and into the aftertaste. Stirring up yeast and dumping it in strangely doesnt change the flavor, but it does produce an inch thick head and pretty good lacing. Lighter than medium body, solid carbonation.

Theres this wonderfully weird and delightful herbal and coriander and lemon and dry dusty grain flavor that overpowers the aftertaste and lingers. Then the next sip, its not there. A little later it is back. Intriguing beer. But now my bottles gone...","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"

Nice golden haze with a small orangey tint at the center. Small but thick capping of solid white froth that keeps for a bit before fading to its collar, where it lays for most of the session. Lacing in some small strings and spots.

Aroma is dull and mild of candish lemon, tangerine, and orange. A small smidgeon of pepper spice and floral yeasty esters gradually appear as it sits.

Taste is wonderfully full of candy played malts that bring one solid stance of pale lemon, orange, and pineapple. Totally like the Tripel, just a tad lessened in girth and activity. But super f*ckin solid for a Wit. Perhaps more malty then most Wits. But man I love it. Thick, chewy, sinking malt tones of favorable candied fruityness of lemon and orange. Yum, yum, candy stuff. Its so well-rounded in a superbly mild dullness of cooked fruity sugars its amazing. Super long lasting and reaching effect in flavors on the palate. Fine touches of peppery dry spice and flints of flowers skip there and fro from about midway all through to the finish. Lovely play of malts with one of the nicest little dispalys of drying spice. Awesome!

Feel is immaculately centered around a malted candyish smoothness and chewyness. Thick, full, lush, and devine. So smooth, yet surging onto the palate with immense wanting. It wants to be drank. It just screams, drink me, drink me, drink me, Im so damn good! And you will oblige to its Kingdom of drinkability with the ease of opening your eyes. Wonderful, wonderful stuff!

Tight, minimal sourness instigates early on, but it gets smoothed out by the clover biscuits.  Candi sugar joins the sweet, nearly rancid, lemon rind, but its a desirable off-flavor.  Some wheat field funk, like mildew on unharvested crop.  Lightly effervescent with the cloves, coriander and styrian giving a slight bite on the backend.  Biscuit malt and maris otter trot with traditional spice nodes, but its a deviation from the standard witbier formula.

Aroma: spice hits first, then soft fruit, pear and citrus, orange, pineapple?, lemon...
Taste: exceptionally smooth, exquisitely soft, a definite joy in the mouth. Coriander taste is consistent throughout and dominates the more delicately played fruit component. Light and utterly downable, yet with significan yeast in the texture to secure it as medium bodied, and so flavorful, it causes one to pause and luxuriate in its splendor.

Hazy light yellowish amber. Full frothy white head. Lemon, banana, wheat aroma. Sweet spicyness too.
Flavor has a doughy smooth lemon wheat character. Very fizzy initially. It seems like a slightly dry, husky wheat body, again with some sweet banana and some doughy bread. Maybe some cinnamon, After two re-rates, I guess Im just not a huge fan. But it is okay.

The typical witbier yeasty spiciness is buried beneath all of the carbonation.  Becomes peppery near the end.  Lively carbonation on the tongue, then mysteriously vanishes along with most all of the flavor and mouthfeel.

4581,"2003-07-10",3.4,"A cloudy hay color with no/little head. I get an aroma of a good Scotch from this with  a scented spice candle as well, some faint citrus but not as much as expected. Unusual range of flavors, tropical fruit up front with a bubble gum, woody, slightly tannic (and very fizzy) middle with a clove-like finish and follow. Not the typical Orange-peel and corriander Wit. Not bad, just a tad strange.","Misawa, JAPAN","IslandHaole"
4581,"2003-06-19",3.4,"Less flavorful than other witbiers I've tried. Cloudy golden, very yeasty/thick texture. Not enough spice IMHO, fairly delicate citrus.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"

4581,"2003-06-04",3.9,"Instantly appealing aroma, with a soft, almost indulgent and citric fruitiness, wheat, faint but very complimentary spices, apparent yeast notes and a flowery, lightly herbal touch.  Glowing bright golden in color, opaque, with a fine, creamy head and lace.  Flavor is similarly structured, becoming perhaps more malty and yeasty, but still lightly citric and spiced.  Creamy, smooth mouthfeel, lightly effervescent but low on the acidity scale.  Refreshing, subtle and very enjoyable.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
4581,"2003-05-26",4.0,"Hazy yellow, dense, small white head, nice lace. Streaming carbonation throughout. Nose of pale malt, orange peel, corriander, touch of clove, yeast and more. Medium bodied, soft, lush with peppery spices, floral yeasts, subtle spices and a gentle malt backbone. Very nice hops at the end, what are these? Goldings? Anyway, a damn fine wit, maybe a bit yeasty heavy for some but nice balance and hop flavor.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"

The flavor has a nice wheaty presence to complement the yeast and fruit.  Probably one of the lesser St. Bernardus beers, but still quite drinkable and very nice for the style","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
4581,"2003-05-22",3.9,"Bottle. Cloudy dark straw color with a wispy white head that clings to the glass.  Light aromas of peach and wheat.  Initial bite of spice and citrus. Dry and very effervescent. Alot of complexity, some horseblanket, hopsack, and barnyard yeast.  Quenching and fulfilling.  One of the better in style, but at 2.99 a bottle, there are less expensive alternatives.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
4581,"2003-05-15",3.9,"Absolutely right on, Muzzle, that this is buttery, and has that greyish tinge that so many of my favorite witbiers have (Stone City for one).

4581,"2003-05-14",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 12, 2008 Dull pear hue.  Noisy  white froth.  Chalky, airy aroma alongside mustiness, aluminum, marshmallow, pumpkin, uncracked coriander seed, vague spicey traits, star anise, melon, lemon flesh, and perfume.  Creamy, slightly thin palate.  Gentle, slightly fizzy carbonation.  Light initial tanginess followed by chalk, slick fruity shades, and metal.  Beautiful juicy Styrian Golding-like finish, which lends  white grape, sour apple, and candied pear flavors.  Underlying dab of pale malt and mustiness.  As with most wits, I would have liked more pale malt structure and noble hop depth.  Still, the yeast showcased some very lovely, complex  fruity aspects.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

4581,"2003-04-06",3.7,"One of my top witbiers.  Cloudy yellow urine colored with compression puff head.  The aroma was a delightful summer's night balm of liquid forest.  Ferns and moss, piquant peppermint pine with puffs of orange and strings of coriander and yeast.  The flavor was not quite as inspiring--a bit thin, but refreshing of subtle orange, pine, and coriander and lemon, perhaps.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"

But I don't like it. [2.8]  Re-rate.
