But from the glass, it was much more benevolent, with dark chocolate and liquorice. Delicious flavours all well woven together, with the typical strong liquorice, the dark chocolates, some smokiness, tobacco and prunes. Very smooth and sweet, somehow like the well-behaved Carnegie and the Sinebrychoff, but with a nice bitterness hanging above the melange, a more savage facet making itself more evident on the long finish.

1832,"2010-04-21",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 26, 2010 Rating #303, bottle from Skjold Burne at Kongens Nytorv, Copenhagen   

This beer is a completely black fellar with a yellow, dense head. The appearance gives a nice impression, but unfortunately this is not the case with the aroma. The aroma is rather metallic and sour, but has some tar and chocolate too. The flavor is as well dissapointing. It is marked by chocolate and sweet liqourice at first, but then it becomes sour, alcoholic and very metallic. The finish is only easily bitter. The beer is thick and soft.  

This beer was originally retired in 2004, when Carlsberg after having bought Wiibroe Brewery, decided to shut down the production in Elsinore. However, the people and beer enthusiasts of Denmark insisted of getting this claimed magnificent porter back on the market, and in 2008 it arrived again.  

I have never understood the hype about this beer, as it is not that special or magnificent. I have bought several specimens to be sure, that the taste is supposed to be as I have rated it, but unfortunately it is.   Maybe the hype is originated in the fact that around the time for this beers retirement, Denmark had really not seen the wave of specialty beers hit yet. Therefore, this beer might be remembered as a special beer for its time, and better than it actually was. 2.8 points.  

26.11.10, re-tasting at free beer tasting at Hatten Bar  

Finally I got a Wiibroe Porter that tasted as it was supposed to. Thank you. This was a black beer with a brown hue, but only unstable head. Aroma was obvious with chocolate and coffee, and flavor had a lot of liquorice, coffee, chocolate, and even the cheese-like flavor I always hope to find in these strong porters. Very nice. Alcohol was not as powerful as the earlier examples of the beer I have had, and the hops were correctly powerful. Furthermore, the beer felt creamy and soft in mouth. Finally a Wiibroe Porter that makes me understand the re-introduction of the beer.","Nysted, DENMARK","flemmingwillum"

1832,"2007-11-25",3.8,"Bottle, five years old. Gorgeous appearance. An opaque ultra-deep brown body is dusted with glowing crimson hints. A finely lacing head is tan, slowly diminishing and creamy. Smokey roasted grains lead in the nose, followed by heavy soy, matted greens and oxidation. This has developed into a really interesting reinterpretation of its former self. Coffee and roasted malts are full strength and suitably mask what seems it wopuld otherwise be hefty amounts of oxidation. The flavor is highly roasty, moderately bitter, lightly warming from alcohol, mildly sweet and lightly astringent. Finishes heavily roasty, with mild chocolate and scorched coffee lingering. Hops in the finish are still evident at this grand old age. The mouthfeel is jagged but drinkable. Very tasty. This seems like an intended blend of the subtle nuances of a traditional Baltic porter and the outlandish eccentricities of a proper, old-school English(original, Russian style) imperial stout.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

I dont know what it wants to be and with a neck label saying ""Porter"" and a body label saying ""Imperial Stout"" Im not sure the brewer knows either.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1832,"2007-08-25",3.2,"My Bottom Line:
An intriguing nose suggested sweet black beans and quality soy until heavily roasted malts and their bready undertones quickly burned the back of the palate. Well put together and highly flavorful, it sadly goes overboard in the finish and thus reduces my enjoyment quite drastically.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the brown-sleeved black.
-The smooth carbonation helped drinkability, but that roasty bitterness was somewhat excessive.
-Didnt get much of the yeasty fruitiness Id associate with the Baltic Porter style...
-Paired with a duck rillette, it actually grew better, as the fat lended some backbone to the brash roastiness.

I guess the caramel is there, but its more of a burnt caramel.  A little noticable alcohol on the finish.  Mouthfeel is full bodied with a nice oily thick texture and moderate soft carbonation.

1832,"2007-01-14",3.6,"This reborn baby pours jet black in my glass and forms a dense, tan but rather weak head. The aroma is slightly metallic, put otherwise dominated by roasted grains and hops. Quite clean...
The taste is roasty, coffeish and a bit burned. Theres a slight note of liqourice. The bitterness is nice and full. And both from the hops and the black malts.
The only real flaw in this beer is the carbonation. Its a bit too aggresive and is in stark contrast to the finer nuances of this incredibly smooth and round beer.
Its a real treat at the stupidly low price of 10 kr (about 1,6 USD)","Vesterbronxxx, DENMARK","petermadsen"

1832,"2004-09-01",4.1,"Ok, what to rate for my 1000th rating? I really wanted to pick a special beer to celebrate my ""anniversary"" so I decided to open this, Wiibroe Porter Imperial Stout Vintage 1987 (BB: May 88), and share it with my beer geek brother and a couple of beer geek friends! I got it earlier this year from a collector who had kept it since back then and knowing that it might have been displayed on an open shelf in a light and warm room I was quite anxious to try it, fearing that it had turned skunky or something even worse. But man, was I in for a nice surprise.....Pours a rather thin tan head on a pitch black body. Heavy and full aroma with lots of chocolate, dark fruit, plum, vanilla, oranges and a tone of coffee. Flavor is very thick and heavy. Nice sweet chocolaty and malty with a woody tone (probably from the age). The beer tastes a little old and over the top but knowing that it probably came from the above-mentioned shelf I must say it matured very well. Still a tasty and very interesting stout and I do understand why it is the highest rated Danish beer (damn Carlsberg for killing it a couple of years ago.....).","Brooklyn, Alabama, USA","Jeppe"
1832,"2004-06-29",4.4,"Best before 03: Pouring a thick, black liquid with a cappuccino-coloured head. Extremely roasted aroma. Salty, watery and dry.

This example was from 1990, and was a bit gloomy: black body, no head and lots of nuggets! the strong aroma and strong taste was bitter, smoked and vineous.

The color is black with a chocolate brown head though collapsing. The aroma is of chocolate, roasted malt, and hints of smoke - fantastic. The flavor is sweet malty with notes of roasted bread, coffee, chocolate, and slight smoke. A fantastic beer. I hate Carlsberg for discontinuing this beer - it was the best porter and maybe the best beer on the Danish market. Unfortunatly it is the big buck and not the flavor that desides the destiny of beers.The new release fresh: A pitch black beer with a huge very dark brown head. The aroma is sweet with strong note of chocolate and roasted malt as well as lighter notes of oranges. The flavor is very sweet with the alcohol tickling the tongue, and with notes of chocolate at first, which resides just a bit to give way to a roasted malt and coffee middle, before a quite bitter finish sets in with bitterness both from chocolate and coffee.
