Pours a slightly cloudy almost-amber colored body. Creamy, bubbly beige head that lasts. 

Aroma is really dull. Im not getting much. But theres a real thick head on it afterall. 
I get some subtle grassy and malty notes. 

Taste is rounded and malty at first but then that belgian yeast, spice and a sharp citrus comes through.

Medium carbonation and medium thick palate. Flavor is medium sweet followed by quite strong bitterness. Aftertaste is bitter and rather boozy where you notice the considerable ABV. Dry finish.

3281,"2016-11-07",3.9,"Amateur de douceur, passez votre chemin! Les moines de labbaye de Maredsous via la brasserie Duvel ont su exploiter au mieux les 10 % Abv de cette triple avec, comme résultat, une bière toute en puissance. En verre la Maredsous triple est dun bel ambré clair, légèrement voilé. Une superbe mousse blanc cassée la surplombe. Le nez laisse déjà pressentir la force de la bière. Sur des notes dorange amère, de candi et de céréales. Lattaque, à linstar du nez, se porte principalement sur les céréales, le candi et les agrumes, dans un bel équilibre et une souplesse certaine. Lamertume qui sensuit est en premier portée sur lorange avec une pointe de girofle avant que le pruneau prenne les devants pour un final qui laisse exploser lalcool. Lensemble est très puissant, moyennement corpulent et sur un final long. La puissance de lalcool prédomine alors largement, les autres arômes passant en arrière bouche. Cependant, la montée crescendo de lalcool évite de déstabiliser la bière qui reste homogène sur lensemble de la dégustation. En conclusion, il nest pas aisé de laisser sexprimer lalcool sur de si fortes intensités sans que cette dernière annihile tout arôme. Cest là, tout le travail de la brasserie Duvel, qui a su lallier à des saveurs justes et à le maîtriser pour quil soit présent sans être exclusif.

Its a real Belgian triple beer aroma. The first thing Ive noticed is the sweet and delicate smell of banana. This aroma reaches the nose already when pouring. The bananas are acini abide by an almondy alcohol aroma. Those two seem to be good friends. The smell has a nice fruity sweetness. However, there is also a good balancing bitterness of some hops. Quite nice. The taste is about the same as the smell. I taste a rich flavor of banana, almond and alcohol. The hoppy bitterness is a lot stronger in the taste than in the smell. It is nice, but the balance between sweet and bitter seems a bit of. The beer could use a bit more sweetness in the flavor.

3281,"2015-02-04",4.1,"De couleur parfaitement cuivrée, cette bière est un délice autant pour les yeux que pour le palais! Sous son épaisse mousse à larchitecture typiquement belge, le liquide est parfaitement translucide et affiche de séduisants reflets dorés. Même plusieurs minutes après le transfert de la bouteille au verre, une grande quantité de bulles émergent énergiquement du fond du verre vers la surface. Il faut toutefois attendre un peu que la mousse sestompe pour dégager pleinement les arômes de cette bière qui rappellent le miel, le foin mouillé, le chocolat blanc et les fruits confits. Quelque chose comme le nougat finalement avec de lalcool en prime! En bouche, on a affaire à une bière très charpentée. Léquilibre entre toutes les saveurs est parfait mais fragile, tant chaque parfum est affirmé. On est tantôt dans le miel, tantôt dans lalcool mais demeure toujours cette constante de raisin et de figue qui sétire longuement en bouche - tout comme leffervescence qui poursuit son travail même une fois dans lestomac. En somme, cette bière complexe vaut la peine dêtre dégustée et partagée.

Aroma of grapes and dark fruits. Something else too,pleasant, but I cant put my nose on it.Mango as someone else wrote? I cant tell and the aroma is quite faint, so it doesnt really help me.
Taste follows the aroma, it tastes very good, and it reminded me of roze wines, except that is of course carbonated.

Superb appearance, with clear orange-amber liquid under a generous and dense tan head that has a slight reddish tint.  The head has excellent feel and duration. 
Aroma: Sweet and complex with spicy yeast, alcohol and alcohol esters, and some pale malts. 
T:  Nicely fruity with a bit of spiciness. Some hops seem apparent in the spiciness and in the excellent bitter/sweet balance. Medium-light body. Good aftertaste suggestive of a spicy/yeasty lambic. Hints of banana, clove, pear, apple and raspberry.

O: I more often than not prefer dubbels over tripels -- including Rochefort & Westmalle. Such is the case with the Maredsous line. In this tripel, the high ABV is a bit too obvious in both the nose and the feel.  Still, unquestionably excellent, with the whole experience exceeding the impression imparted by individual sensory characteristics.

Well, Ive unearthed a bottle with an old label from deep in the spider infested corners of The Beerium - bbf 03 2011 - No idea when I got this. Poured out a thick carpet of smooth froth that will not leave, filthy old burnt orange brown beer after the toxic spooning in of goop. damn... almost forgot about the review... nice aroma of pears, sweet plums, cherry based mild spice on long sniffs, light clove and a bit of burnt sugar. Smells pretty good, ja. Tasty. Initial watery thoughts get forgotten due to a stronger spice contingency after considerable warming. Light alcohol burn, some smoothness. Fuck. my consecutive bean based meal is catching up to me. Plumy, clove, alc, mild initial bitterness, some nose bitterness. Not a lot of flavour complexity here. Molasses, citrus, ya. On the Funyun scale - which has no defining ""out of"" scale - it has been decided by a group of American experts that I have gathered after years of study and research - that this beer is 8 Funyuns. This is totally based on the pure enjoyment level and cultural value of Funyuns by others as I myself have not only never enjoyed one, Ive never even seen a bag for sale as they are not shipped to Canada. I also have consistently spelled it incorrectly. But the scale - undefined in its terms of conventional scales - not based ""out of"" 10 is not only legit and logical - it is legally binding in 162 countries (not including Bahrain - sorry).

The nose is a solid mix of spices, but theres a hint of perfumed soap here - this recedes with time.  Theres the quintessential buttery element that introduces a subtle savoury profile of herbs and gently sautéed onions.  This is all propped up by a generous yeast character which ties everything into a honeyed whole.  The taste is much the same: spicey, herbal, perfumed; with good dryness.  The finish is a slow regression to that first note of perfumed spices and then a little alcohol sting.

Maredsous triple ?
Cette belle annonce nous fait découvrir une triple de couleur blond profond, à la 
limite de lambré, avec une mousse blanc cassé à beige qui nappe valablement
le liquide caché dessous.
Nous chercherons pourtant à latteindre et à savoir ce quil vaut !!!
Mon breuvage avait dailleurs largement dépassé lâge de la retraite (2 ans de plus),
ce qui constitue toujours un défi pour une blonde et donc pour une triple.
Mais quà cela ne tienne, il restait quelques fines bulles et des arômes qui sétaient
développés sur les fruits confits et le blé mûr.
Le volume est soyeux à souhait (une vraie tapisserie de velours).
Puis la 1ère bouche se révèle avec une très belle finesse et des accents de pelure 
dorange.
La 2ème a la densité des blés à la moisson.
La 3ème nous livre des prunes, des fruits dautomne et un léger piquant sur la langue.
La levure fait son travail sans rechigner.
La longueur est correcte.
La finale ressort en équilibre, et nous transmet toutes les nuances précédentes.
Donc on ne peut critiquer cette blonde (triple quand même, merci) sans lui concéder
dêtre de caractère, faite par un brasseur exceptionnel (Duvel), à léquilibre bien pensé
entre rondeur et piquant amer, sans aucun excès. Très belle arrière-bouche dès la seconde

Some nice lacing clinging on the glass, with plenty of carbonation streaming up.  Aromas of apricot, lemon, pear, biscuit, tart grains, pepper, clove, candi sugar, and yeast spices.  Decent aromas but they are pretty faint for a tripel.  Taste of apricot, lemon, banana, orange, clove, bread, candi sugar, pear, grape, tart grain, and yeast spices.  Lingering notes of citrus, clove, pear, biscuit, candi sugar, and yeast spices on the finish for a while.  Nice balance of flavors with decent complexity.  Definitely more of a fruity tripel, but is not cloying.  Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that drinks quite smoothly.  Alcohol is well hidden for 10% with a slight warming after the finish.  Overall this is a very nice and enjoyable Tripel.  Good complexity and balance; with nice smoothness.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

La prima annusata sboccia in accordi di fiori e frutta matura. A un secondo respiro emerge il lievito. Bisogna dire che laroma non è particolarmente intenso.
Limpatto in bocca è importante, sia per linaspettata potenza del perlage, sia per il sapore deciso e ruvido. Comincia con un amaro repentino che apre la strada ancora al lievito e che infine sboccia in un ventaglio di accenti fruttati  e freschi.
Al ritorno in bocca rimane molto asciutta ma con una decisa ombra di frutta che lascia un piacevolissimo ricordo.
Una consiglio: da provare in assoluto silenzio. Sigillando velocemente la bocca appena dopo la sorsata é possibile sentire fin dentro alle orecchie un sonoro applauso: il rumore del perlage che esplode come solo i migliori champagne sanno fare!","","squarta"

Taste: Sweet, candy-encrusted pale malts along with a fruity, spicy taste of lightly tart pear upside-down spice cake featuring Bartletts. Grows a bit more peppery, hinting at bitter herbs as some medicinal alcohol leeches in. Faintly cellar-like yeastiness. Moderate bitterness. Finishes with a firmly warming embrace of alcohol to cut the sweetness, as does the carbonation prickliness.

The creamy, white head is rather small, but fully lasting and produces excellent lacing. Initially light sweet and light acidic taste (is that even possible?), then light bitter. Finally the magic touch: the high alcohol contents creates a long lasting, mouthfilling, warming and honey-sweet after taste (similar to that of the Chimay Triple). Smooth, medium, almost syrupy body, with average to soft carbonation. The alcohol is maybe a bit too pronounced, but as opposed to the kick-you-in-the-face attitude of the alcohol of the Westmalle Triple, the alcohol of the Maredsous is more gentle and caressing.

It pours into my Duvel tuplip with a foamy slightly off-white head that fills up to the brim, though it is slanted, probably because of my pour. The beer is a hazy brown/reddish/copper/peach and there are tiny bubbled racing form the etched duvel D.

It is fruity, clovey, with an exceptions bit of yeast. The malts are there though subdued by the yeasty zing.

It is zingy and twangy with yeast in the flavor. The malts come out more in the flavor with a huge hit of breadcrust. There is a slight hint of lemony fruitiness too. A great tasting Tripel.

Off-white cream colored head is about 2 fingers with some chunky foam rising above the rim. Head duration is medium length. Most of head eventually settles, though leaves nice amount of foam on surface  much more than simply a thin layer of film like some other Belgian ales. Plentiful Belgian lace.

AROMA: Belgian yeast, some spice, and vinous aroma  much more vinous/sour grape scent than most Belgian triples. Faint hop scent hidden behind other aromas, though difficult to determine more specific hop characteristics. Extremely faint grape bubblegum. Some alcohol on nose as well. 
TASTE: Belgian yeast and spice on front of palate. Subtle citrus and floral notes on front of palate as well. 
Mid palate is some vegetable and subtle grainy caramel malt. 
Back of palate and finish is alcohol. 
MOUTH FEEL: Highly carbonated. Quite dry. Drinks like champagne. 
OVERALL: Alcohol dominates over body. Difficult to drink. Far from quaffable. Others may enjoy, though, personally doubt will buy this beer again. Too champagne-like.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"

The malt was clearly present, along with flavors of stone fruit, and a touch of spice.  The hops could have been a bit bolder, and there was also a slight whiff of moldy funk.

Eventually proves itself sweet, but far from cloying. Dry, bitter finish and aftertaste. Fizzy and lively in the palate. Medium body. Unremarkable palate effects beyond a slightly excessive fizziness. Like many other Belgians, it looks and smells better than it tastes, but, overall, its pretty darn good!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

3281,"2010-06-05",3.9,"Thanks to Jared and Serge for hooking me up. I had to wait for this to come from Belgium & took 4 months. Also got some Westvleteren 12, which ill review in the next week. 
Poured a slightly opaque amber color with a slightly off-white yellowish head. The head was full at first but reduced fairly quickly. Smells earthy - woody and kid of musky. lots of alcohol. Also getting some sweet fruity and malty aroma. 
There is a fair bit of carbonation as soon as it enters the mouth. The taste actually carried into my nose. Slightly smoky flavor, with notes of rasin - i think there is cherry and banana back there somewhere. Definitely a lot of alcohol burn. I love how it transitions from sweet and bold to slightly bitter. kind of like taking a shot of bourbon and chasing it with an IPA. My last sip was about 15 mins ago and im still tasting it.

3281,"2010-04-22",3.8,"Bottle consumed at the Sharp Edge Bistro last week. 11.2 oz bottle poured into a snifter.

A-The body is a hazy dark gold-almost copper colored. Looked great but much darker than most tripels I have come across. More along the lines of some Grand Crus or Strong Belgian Amber Ales (which I really think deserve their own style category on this website).

S-Nose is full of exotic fruits. Mango, apricot, maybe some peach, and maybe some pineapple. Behind this is the scent of sweet bready yeast and a phenolic presence.

T-Taste is similar to the smell. Lots of exotic fruits can be tasted upfront (see above). Behind this is a sweet bready yeast backbone. A slight floral hop presence emerges as the other flavors intensify. Then the big, slightly bitter alcohol presence emerges. What lingers is an alcohol heat along with a faint resemblance of the other flavors mentioned.

P- Nice medium-weight smooth yeasty mouthfeel.

O- Decent beer overall with good flavors and mouthfeel...but it got too boozy toward the end of the glass. Though this is a tripel...it has more Belgian Amber flavors than Belgain Pale flavors to me. Very nice...check the date and do some aging on this one though.

3281,"2009-12-21",4.1,"With a swing and miss on Maredsous 8, I was slightly hesitant about giving this one a go but in the end it was really a damn good beer.  It poured out of the stubby bottle a dark, cloudy orange body, a thick 2"" creamy off-white head and beautiful lacing.  The head had really impressive staying power too.  Coming off the top of this thick head were huge wages of alcohol, flowers, honey, shortbread cookies, and light pitted fruit.  Spicy bread notes, banana, alcohol, with a honey-like finish.  The only thing negative to find was the overbearing carbonation found in many Belgian style beers and while some work well, this was manageable but it could have been worse.  The beer really worked well over-all and is a nice beer to show someone the style of a tripel.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"

3281,"2009-12-07",3.8,"Pours from the stubby 11.2 oz bottle a hazy orangeish gold color with the typical HUGE Belgian head that settles into very thick collar.  The carbonation is also typical of a Belgian...what seems like millions of tiny bubbles race to the underside of the head of foam that remains.  Wonderful aroma...peaches, apricot, and hone come to mind.  The first sip has a dry, spicy, peppery note that belies the sweet, fruity aroma.  Mouthfeel is light and tingly from the carbonation.  There is an odd bitterness on the swallow, a somewhat ""chemical"" note that lingers after the swallow and takes a couple of points off of the total enjoyment.  (Note:  upon further review, that taste may be from the yeast sediment.  In the interest of fairness, ill have to pour another one at another time, sans sediment, and see how it stacks up.)  There really isnt much hint of the 10% abv...no harshness or alcohol burn.  That makes this a slightly dangerous brew in the sense that it could sneak up on you & bite you if youre not careful.

3281,"2009-08-09",4.1,"I will always remember the timeless advocate of beer, Michael Jackson, when quaffing a Maredsous abbey ale. Self-proclaimed as his favorite brewery of abbey ales, it was easy to understand why after supping on their Tripel which has aged beautifully. As much as I love Belgian beers, I cant pick a favorite. Just when I think Ive made up my mind, I think of another Belgian beer I love and the cycle starts all over again. Meh. Im not even going to try anymore. In fact, enough of this blathering. I have a Maredsous Tripel to lavish praise upon.


As I slowly pour the liquid contents from her bottle into my chalice, my face glows as the sun descends from her heavenly throne to settle into my glass. Were there ever more brilliant hues of amber, garnet, blood-orange, and gold to grace a beer glass? As she reaches the top of my glass, a velveteen head of white foam preens most mighty before humbly leaving a scattered network of lace in memoriam. Just as her visage shines high noon from my glass, so too does her nose. Sweet, doughy, yeasty, spiced, and bursting with tropical fruits dangling plump from their limbs. Applesauce with cinnamon sprinkles and cooked apples, juicy and lip-coating to be sure. Oranges and mango exude ripeness even as bunches of herbs exude their own aromatics. Her alcohol warmth is sweet, melting into fruits, warm yeasty dough, and spices perfectly. A kiss of honey and life is bliss. With a nose as rich as this, so too must be her body. Thick and creamy dances with soft and effervescent every quaff of the way. Honey coats my lips as oranges and mangos melt in my mouth, not in my hand. Their juices trickle along the sides of my mouth while honey and cinnamon-sugar sprinkles join the fray. The meat of her palate is all sweet tropical fruits, dough, and spice while her finish is warm and dry. I can definitely start to feel her alcohol warmth as my chest and cheeks develop a pleasant glow. My breath is all about fresh herbs and then suddenly, sooner than I wished, my glass is empty.


A rich palate leads to a rich soul. Even the simplest of beers can have a rich palate, though there is usually nothing simple about quaffing a Belgian tripel. The Maredsous Tripel, aka the Maredsous 10, is an excellent abbey tripel. Considering they are brewed by Duval-Moortgat, this comes as little surprise. Make sure to note the best-buy date on the back, and enjoy anytime before then. Ive had fresh and aged; both are beautifully in their own subtly different ways.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

3281,"2009-02-25",3.9,"11.2oz brown glass squat pry-top bottle. BB 04.2011 on back label. Thanks to our new Duvel rep., Tori, for this one.

Appearance: Started to flow over when I opened it, poured a sudsy orange-amber with 1.5 fingers of sudsy light cream head. Not quite clear.

Nose: Caramel and light milk chocolate are the first things to mind. Dried apricots, dried pineapple, and maybe a hint of black olives.

Palate: Lively and almost crisp with acidity. Very ""bright."" Hints of chocolate covered cherries (cordials), a moist tobacco note, plus that dried pineapple (covered in light milk chocolate) comes back. Papaya too, perhaps, without the chocolate.

Notes: A tasty tripel, but not my favorite. It manages to avoid feeling too sweet by having a little acidity to clean up the edges. Impressed with whole ""milk chocolate"" thing from such a pale beer. Well done.","Burlington, Vermont, USA","SFLpunk"

Delectable spicy tastes of pepper, earth, raw green nuts and sticky clove that complement the fruit flavors, orange, pineapple, green pears and apples. The alcohol provides a low grade warmth in the palate and has the flavor of spicy nuts. A tasty herbal spiciness comes out in the dry finish along with lingering tastes of husky wheat and yeast.

The beer pours a deep, hazy gold with a thick white head that is somewhat short-lived, consists mostly of large bubbles (though not soapy), and leaves some lace on the glass (but not much). The aroma is sweet with a slight herbal quality - very malty and sugary smelling with a touch of honey, a light dose of grass, and some alcohol. The beer begins quite sweet and bubbly in the front of the mouth. The sweetness is grainy - and the graininess grows towards mid-palate. The alcohol also grows towards mid-palate. The flavor has some characteristic Belgian esters, but is for the most part clean and sweet with a light touch of grassy hops in the flavor and a balancing, herbal bitterness on the middle and back of the tongue.

3281,"2007-06-11",3.8,"This beer impressed by being both a pretty tasty beer and fairly different from other tripels Ive had.  The beer is spicy (typical) but this spice is balanced by a citrus sweetness that I found very well balanced.  My notes also contain the phrase ""the opposite of mellow,"" which I remember thinking as praise masked as criticism.  Combine this with the fine carbonation and smooth mouthfeel that secondary fermentation can provide, and you have yourself a winner.

This beer poured a dark straw color with a very white head.  Aroma was a lot of clove combined with some zesty citrus notes.  Taste was very clovey with a touch of sour.  The remark in my notes ""the opposite of mellow"" remind me that I thought this beer was ""big"" but also had potential for those who age beers to become something more complex in time.

Slowly down the glass a billowing white head formed easily 2"" in thickness. Vibrant orange color that sparkles through a hazy body. Splotchy lacing, the creamy head ultimately settles to a finger thick. Soft aroma of Belgian yeast, malts, and spices. Musty with some light earthiness, there is a really faint alcohol presence really surprising how hidden the abv is in this one. I detect a mix of flowers and mild fruit, banana and clove primarily but there is more to it. Peppery with some sweet candy sugars.

Into a chalice at around room temperature. Head, as expected does its rise on the pour, a big, dense messy off-white mass that further expands, holds well and laces wildly. The beer a very hazy, almost muddy, tawny amber  with minute bubbles streaming endlessly. Aroma, so feint I thought I must have a head Cold. What I did get was chemical, medicinal alcohol with some fairy-floss sugary goodness. Big frothy, come smooth palate like a chocolate mousse. Toffee and caramel, and undeniable butterscotch gamminess on the palate, sweet but controlled only by unnecessarily higher alcohols that feast off the palate in back and into the yeasty, bready, gluggy, oily swallow. It becomes, amongst its diacetyl and fusel ridden palate, quite doughy, and altogether bothersome, awkward on the palate. I didnt like this one at all, obviously, but a back-up came as the wife tasted it saying it was ""like yeasty bread dipped in Vodka"".

3281,"2007-04-27",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2015 The first time I ever saw the Maredsous 10 was at a famous tap house in downtown Denver.  Everything on the wall seemed kind of average, kind of droll, and kind of unexceptional, except the Maredsous.  Right when I was about to raise and a hand a get a pint of this tasty tripel, my friend interjected and announced the glory of a different beer; it turned out to be a bland IPA, but what was worse I had missed an opportunity to sample a fancy sounding beer from the tap.  The second visit to the same tap house was another failed opportunity, foiled by temptation of a short-lived keg of beer that had arrived a few days earlier.  When I finally got my clutches on a bottle of the Maredsous I was relieved to, at last, sample a beer that had consistently evaded me.  My efforts, Ive found, were not in vain.  The Maredsous poured thickly, forming a profoundly dense head, and clarifying to compose a body color reminiscent of a rotting orange peel  somewhere between brown and orange.  However, the smell was far more appealing and satisfying, much like pronouncing this beers elegant name.  Wheat and coriander portray the Maredsous as a doppelganger of a wheat beer, and the ticklish tinge of lemon and lime confirm it.  The smell of sautéed chicken breast, something Ive never detected in a beer before, dispels the illusion and puts the Maredsous in its rightful place as a tripel.  If a drinker is still confused as to whether the Maredsous leans towards wheat or tripel, a taste settles the matter, washing the tongue with a combination of hops and wheat, brilliantly balanced against each other but composing a full flavorful taste of grain.  Caramel and honey join the mixture, giving their sugary blessings before the flavor profile turns dry and savory again.  The aftertaste is an elegiac conclusion, throttling the esophagus with a dwindling alcohol burn in a sort of last gasp of regret.  The Maredsous 10 runs the gamut of sweet and savory, assertive enough for some hearty starch based meals like thick-red pasta dishes or even pork, and may very well be an excellent ingredient in cooking.  A braise or marinade comes to mind most especially, but wherever it is applied the Maredsous will wow with its flexibility in flavors, prancing all over the tongue and entertaining all audiences.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

The mouthfeel is tremendous...really sticks around quite a while.  This is quite a Belgian beer.  I am a big fan of this style, and it didnt disappoint.  This beer sat around in my basement awhile...I could always find another beer that was higher rated to try in its place.

Smell is of mildly doughy, caramel, candi sugar, apricots, citrus, herbal, & earthy notes, with perhaps of touch of banana deep in the background.
Taste is sweet of melted caramel, apricot reduction, sugar, pepper, and a decent malty quality that has flashes of the citrusy hops.

Aroma was tough for me to detect, all I was able to notice (at that time anyway) was a bit of yeast.  Taste is sweet upfront with caramel malt flavors and fruitiness competing for your attention.  However, the sweet qualities in this beer simply dont mesh well with the other flavors (and I usually like very sweet beers).  The finish is equally conflicted, with a bitterness that doesnt seem hop-related at all.  Its like it became kind of astringent when it hit my throat.

Aroma displays some hops bitterness, Belgian biscuit malt, dry, mossy earthiness and some alcohol.  Flavor is strange, to say the least, to my palate.  Not anything like any other trippel Ive tried, let alone a traditional Belgian trippel.  Very dry, mossy, fuzzy, yeastiness, with a dry, bready/biscuity malt that hides any sweetness.  I think I taste hops bitterness at first, and after a couple more sips, the notion is confirmed.  Yes, quite unmistakeably hoppy and moderately bitter as a result.  A bit of nuttiness from the hops, light alcohol and spiciness on the end, dry as per the start.  As it breathes, the robust carbonation dies off and there is some dry toffee-like notes, probably just a bit of the malt sweetness peeking out from the biscuit or aromatic malt.  My palate does grow accustomed to the beer as I drink it and though Im not a huge fan of bitter dryness, and biscuity astringency, the beer is not watery or thin.  Alcohol does not run wild, despite this being one of the strongest trippels Ive tried thus far.

Aroma: a bit vacant, and Im surprised, can this be so? Fruity, sweet, but laying inordinately low, with quiet hops and a pervading flatness in the feel, altogether. Humph.
Taste: thick fruit personality on the palate, citrus, orange,pineapples, tasty, tangy, but lacking a certain zing, from hops, from anything. Full of malt and yeast, lacking a lightness I find in better tripels, thats always matched by abundant spicy, fruity kick. Feels sticky, leaden, thick, does not dance delightfully upon the tongue, no matter how strongly I wish that it would.
No, this isnt working, and I cant figure out whats wrong with it, for I was so anticipating happiness in this glass. 
Toward the end, Im not as disappointed as I was at the start, but its still such a departure from what Id expect from a tripel. Maybe its the 10% creeping in?

Pours with a fluffy off white head that sits atop a well carbonated hazy orange gold beer.  The aroma is yeasty, spicy and sharp with notes of grass, soft vanilla, and herbs.  The taste is sweet up front and in the finish as well.  The middle though, is sharp with a carbonic bite and a foaming tongue.  The flavors I get from this beer run the gamut; from vanilla to hay, cider, yeasty/ bready, herbs, and alcohol.  As this beer warms up a bit it begins to develop some funky complexity in the nose; a funky farmhouse cheese seems to have been suddenly dipped in my beer.  The alcohol starts to become quite apparent in the nose as well.  Visually this beer leaves some nice Belgian lacing as I work my way through the first glass of this 750ml bottle.  This is quite an enjoyable Triple, I would highly recommend it to any Triple or Belgian beer lovers.  If I would have to find a fault, I would say that it is just not quite complex enough to make it world class, but this is a rather weak complaint.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Stateside: Gushed a bit, and poured with lots of yeast adrift.  Bronze colored, had to force the head a bit, decent lace.  Yeasty aroma, not getting malt or hops in the nose, smells a bit metallic or oxidized.  Decent flavor, but rather short and simple with an alcoholic heat at the end(which I dont like much).  Not bitter, but it burns and lingers. Besides the alcohol it would drink well(on the light side).  Just not that interesting and at 10%ABV Id hope to be overrun with complexity.

Taste is very smooth and calm, well rounded and leveled citrus thats dulled down by alot, some orange, lemon, green grapes, mango, banana, and pineapple all kinda blend and make for a one of those squishy things, but not in a juicy manner, more of dull popcicle-like flavor. A strange but appealing dryness floats off the palate at the finish which is kinda interesting and nice.

Poured out a orangey-straw color, with a dense meringue-like head. It stayed around for the entire ride. More than decent lacing on this beer. Aromas are of dried apricots, slight citrus smell too. Probably from corriander more than anything else. Slight phenolic character also. Peppery alcohol and bready yeast flavors make for an interesting combination.

As it warmed up (I've got to break down and get a thermometer at some point), flavors begin to explode all over the place.  The malts rose up and asserted themselves in a honey smoothness, along with a suprisingly true sour grapefruit flavor, with some bubblegum.  As I swirled in the bit with a nice pour of yeast, the flavors became even more exotic, beckoning of overripe oranges, loam, and strangely enough, potato vodka.

But I'm presented with a problem: my old bottle not only has no BBdate, is supposed to be brewed at Denée (were the monastery is) and is called Brassin du Centenaire/Eeuwfeestbrouwsel. That was a more fancy name than the down-to-earth 'Tripel 10'!
The points above are from the newer version.
Colour: 10: pale orangey-amber; thick head, slightly yellowish, slowly collapsing/ Cent: dark chestnut, disparate head with thick, lonely bubbles, no carbonation [4/5] Nose: 10: first some fresh summer weeds, then coloured malt/ Cent: portwine, walnuts, cardboard and maple syrup [9/10] Taste: 10: bone-dry, candi-sugar flavour, a bit of orange rind/ Cent: Alcohol by Jove, and higher alcohols as well. Very vineous, oily even. Retronasal explosion of very ripe, sugared fruits. [9/10]
Mouthfeel: 10: unlike the dryness suggests, very full-bodied. After a few sips, a bitterness creeps in, slowly building up in the back of the mouth/ Cent: rather thin-bodied, but alcohols and oilyness. All that fruit takes some time to dissipate [5/5] Overall: 10: DAMN, another Westmalle tripel copy. Technically perfect, interest pffft/ Cent: WOW [18/20]

Very sweet, but yet mildly dry ending, not overwhelming by any means. Citrusy tartness from the hops attack the palate in the beginning and give way to a nice malty ending.

Passionfruit, hops and a touch of citric sour horse stable yeast aromas. Medium body. Smooth soft bitter-sweet palate. Flavours include fresh fruit and some of that 10% comes through but its not overpowering. Bitter dry finish.

3281,"2002-03-04",3.5,"Nice slightly sweet, fruity aroma.  The color is cloudy, golden with a very frothy head.  Just looking at it, there appears to be a LOT of carbonation, and first taste confirms it.  Its sweet, with a little taste of medicine or herbs maybe...or spice.  Hard to pinpoint because the alcohol takes over at that point til the finish.  A good warmer, but maybe too much so.  I liked it but I agree that it needs more balance between flavor and alcohol content.  I would like to try the 8.","Sherman, Texas, USA","unixweb"

3281,"2002-01-17",3.5,"750ml bottle. Cloudy peach with a frothy white head and heavy carbonation. Aroma of pineapple, cloves, yeast and dishwashing liquid. Hugely effervescent body loaded with alcohol and a sugared edge. Immediate warm fuzziness warms the throat. Hoppy aftertaste, very spicy and herbal. Mellows a bit while sitting where the honeyed sweetness tries in vain to overtake the alcohol. Adding the yeast tempers the alcohol taste a bit, but it remains distracting. Salty taste at times. Finishes with a cotton candy dry sweetness and less alcohol thankfully. A struggle to finish a big bottle, with the alcohol not being well integrated. Still a good beer just needs some balance.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"

3281,"2001-12-21",3.2,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2006 33cl bottle. Head is initially large, frothy, white, mostly lasting. Body is hazy light amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted grain/bread), lightly hoppy (herbs), moderately yeasty (mold, cobwebs), with a note of alcohol. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately to heavily bitter, yeasty. Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic. Big, yeasty beer that could really use some brighter, fresher hops for aromatic interest.  Rather coating, yeasty finish that isnt too pleasant.  A little over the top in some ways, too understated in others.  A rather confused beer.  Not that fond of it, despite it being more too style than a great many labeled as ""tripel"".","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
