3829,"2017-06-08",3.8,"Shared 12.7 oz., 2015 bottle, with my portion served to a fest sampler showing a hazed, light gold/straw color, with modest, white froth that reduced quickly to a persistent ring, and some spots of lacing. The nose was bretty funk, soft malt/wheat, and a citrusy tartness & tanginess. The taste was similar, light to medium bodied, with some spritz to the effervescence, and continued funk that partnered with an earthy bitterness. Refreshing, on point Saison+ that cellared well and stayed fairly bright.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"

3829,"2016-12-24",4.0,"It pours golden with a white head. It has plenty of Belgian lace on the side. Clarity is good. The aromas are highlighted by the brett with leather being the strongest aroma and barnhouse being in the background. It also has aromas of lemon, spicy notes, and some fruit. There are some subtle grainy notes as well that are not to distinct. The flavors are full of tartness. The flavors are highlighted by fruit and lemon with spicy pepper, leather. There is an initial bitterness that fades as the tart flavors take over. It has a light body towards the moderate side with a dry finish. There is also quite a bit of carbonation as well. Overall this is a highlight of the Brett with a complex mixture of hops and malts with the brett being dominant in the flavor and the other flavors provide a solid backbone.","Pinehurst, North Carolina, USA","hman43"
3829,"2016-12-12",3.9,"375 ml bottle from Pearl Street Beverage in Burlington, VT, consumed at cellar temp from a Duvel glass. Pours a huge frothy snow-white head that diminishes with moderate haste above a lightly cloudy pale gold body...aroma at first comes off as skunky, but settles quickly into typical brett funkiness and tartness - a little bathroom, a little mildew, some fresh hay and some rotting, and a touch of sweet flowers on display after a few minutes in the glass....on the tongue its quite tart with a fairly strong acidity, and this plays out through the whole tasting, only moderating very slightly after at least 10 minutes more warming in the glass; its not quite so dry as a lambic but overall it is closer to a gueuze in character than any other non-lambic brett beer Ive had I think; not really all that much like a saison if you ask me and were I rating by style Id have to take off a lot of points there - this is a sour beer more than anything else and as such its a very good one, up to this great brewerys usual standards...it finishes in the mouth reasonably full with more than a little oaky-vinous quality; carbonation is strong but not at all overdone.

3829,"2016-08-12",4.1,"375ml January 2016 bottle from Craft Beer Cabin, thanks Guillaume for buying. Aroma: big citrus nose mixed with some ripped green raisins giving this white wine aroma light acetic notes (vinegar), really far biscuit malt. App: cloudy golden with huge head slowly cussing to a small head, good lacing. Taste and palate: medium body, high carbonation, lots of lemon juice in mouth, finish is moderately acetic. Overall: when too cold I didnt enjoy much the mouthfeel. Combination of the big citrus acidity with the big carbonation made it a bit hard to drink. But once a tad warmer and the carbonation settled, I find it much much better. Another great beer from Allagash.","St-Jean-sur-Richelieu, Quebec, CANADA","Stoned99"

Nose is of fruits, dirty socks, brett funk, sulfur and oak. Taste is of fruits and white wine, lightly earthy. Recognizable as a saison but not a really good one to me. Body is medium and carbonation moderately high. Overall it was OK, a bit of a letdown knowing who it is coming from, though.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
3829,"2015-05-13",4.1,"bottle shared by minderbinder, many thanks for this one bro! pours unclear light but bright golden with a nice white cap, good retention and lacing. pale crackery maltiness, crisp pils, light peppery wheat, subtle yet fragrant floral citrus, very nice fruity esters - orchard fruitiness-galore with a tropical touch; winey character - dusty white grapes and fruity bretts. bright to average carbonation, light body; gently tannic/astringent, tart and floral-citrusy finish. very very good stuff, although i prefer their regular tastefull saison.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
3829,"2015-05-12",3.5,"The beer is a yellow, fairly pale with a touch of orange. The head is fairly fizzy and white. Little lacing and fades away quickly. The liquid is cloudy but I kicked a good amount of sediment. The aroma is tropical fruit with some lime and a background of dusty, earthy saison character. The beer has a sort of overripe fruit flavor, which is nice enough, but as it warms, some cheesiness comes out and the combination doesnt quite work for me. Theres also some simple pale malty sweetness knocking around. Mild funk. Id prefer a bit more saison flavor and a bit less malt. The taste is nice enough. Friendly saison yeastiness and fruity hops. Mild but definite bitterness. A little tang. It dries out some in the finish. Medium full feel. Some effervescence, fizz.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

3829,"2015-04-24",3.8,"Bottle. Hazy yellow with fluffy off white head. This one is a little weird in a good way. Starts out as a tart saison with citrus fruit and grass, and as the finish kicks in it adds a very strong caramel kind of note, ending on toasted biscuit. The caramel becomes less prominent as the beer warms. Not at all what I was expecting but this was very interesting.","","conway"

3829,"2015-04-19",3.8,"375 ml and to be honest this traveled in a car before I opened it so the yeast was shook up so it is not clear at all. Bottled 5 February 2015. Aroma is citrus forward with a solid of funky yeast. 
The flavor is again citrus forward with lemons, limes, grain and mild band aid. The brett is taking over with a good balance of citrus. Not sure how this sat around this long before it hit distribution in NH but.... Anyone who lives in NH knows distribution here is not good. This brew is exactly as it should be and Im glad it sat around a tad.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

3829,"2015-04-10",4.2,"Bottled 2/5/15, drunk 4/9/15Off-copper body (like that one?) is topped by a white head that is initially large but fully recedes to nothing. Clarity is high, leaving the plentiful sediment behind.Full-on brett nose pushes forth even from underneath the hop notes, which are delightfully herbal and citric (dry tangerines, meyer lemons) as touches of biscuity malts are lost in the shuffle. No alcohol or any flaws noted in the nose.Breezed through the aroma so I could get to the flavor which is more interesting. Not because the aroma isnt incredible; it is, but because Im very torn on how I feel about this beer, based on its flavor.Its deliciously brett-laden; lots of lime skins, hickory, light band aids, etc....and the malts are well attenuated but still leave structure behind, contributing a light, but ample body. The flavors are all very cohesive, nothing here dominates or comes off showy. So in that regard, whats not to love? A wonderfully understated, drinkable, graceful brett saison. Ah, but therein lies the problem. Is this a saison? I dont doubt they pitched saison yeast in to it, but it dosent come through at all. Perhaps its a mild-mannered saison yeast, perhaps its just covered up by the brett and hop notes. I dont know. It does come off a bit sterile for lack of a better term. I guess thats a complement to the production of the beer but I cant help being a bit disappointed by how clean and neat this beer is. I guess that just dosent say Saison to me. Brett golden ale? Definitely. Saison? Not so much. Does it matter? No, not really.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
