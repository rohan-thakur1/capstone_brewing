4471,"2017-06-13",3.8,"Big thanks to WillemsUrenkel for that one! Bottle looke simple but really good. Beer in the glass deep black, nice head. Fine malty-stouty aroma. Starts milder than exspected, malty, light roasty, earthy, modest dry. More and more alcoholic notes but not too intense. More warming-malty. Mild sweetness with hints of caramel. Well balanced finish and quite drinkable. Dangerous!","GERMANY","kappldav123"

4471,"2017-04-07",3.7,"(bottle, 33cl) Clear (?), dark brown to black colour with a beige and firm mid-sized foamy head. Earthy and leafy, mildly roasted malty aroma with notes of leather and traces of milk chocolate. Moderately sweet and mildly roasty bitter flavour, medium to full bodied with a soft carbonation. Schwarzbierbock-character with earthy and leafy notes, rather milky than dark chocolate, shades of dried fruits; sweet-bitter, mildly roasted, almost silky finish with a well-masked, almost muted alcoholic strength.

4471,"2017-03-31",3.9,"330ml bottle via trade with Koelschtrinker. Thank you!
Looks: Clear Cola blackish brown colour with a very thin trace of yeast particles; One-quarter finger head with soapy light beige foam which fades in 40 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with near zero carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant dark malt, with strong roastyness, hazelnuts, strong dark chocolate, iced coffee, strong cream, caramel, strong toffee, light plum, light Rum, vanilla, wood, sugar, earth, bread, light yeast and light grass. Subtle and complex!

Taste: Strong sweet rich dark malt, with strong roastyness, strong cherry, red fruits, plums, strong Rum-like alcohol, strong caramel, sticky toffee, strong dark chocolate, coffee, light floral, sugar syrup, spices, herbs, earth, bread, yeast, lemon and strong bitter grassy hops. Nice!

Body: Full body. Thick and creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: Full dark maltyness in a slightly oily background. Creamy and smooth. A fine mix of Rum-booze with strong roastyness encircle a strong mix of cherry, plums, strong dark chocolates and toffee. Topped with strong but nice syrup, earthy herbs, and spice. Lemon to round. Rich and tasty!

Alcohol: the 9.1% booze is very notable but as a light Rum, very tasty with only mild knock on. Liquorices is sweet, mildly astringent which blends well into the bitterness. Good stuff!

Hoppiness: Earth, and light grass inn nose. Light floral, spices, herbs, earth, lemon and strong grass in taste; Bitterness is quite strong for a lasting, mid to high astringent sweet-bitter chocolatey finish.

After Taste: Quite Dry. Sweet herbal boozy and bitter to mouth.

Comments: As a freeze-distilled Porter, this is very well-controlled with nice smooth body, complex aromas of roast, dark chocolate and light Rum. Taste-wise its very focused, the fruity malt, bitter chocolate, coffee and herbal spicyness just blend together nicely with a hoppy bang. So comfy it slowly sinks in with every sip. A winner!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

4471,"2017-03-05",4.1,"Nice black body. Complex aroma of toffee, blackberries, licorice, pumpernickel, vanilla and alcohol.

4471,"2016-11-25",4.2,"Das Nordik Porter ist ein Eisbock, welcher aus dem normalen Starkbier der Störtebeker Braumanufaktur hergestellt worden ist. Die Farbe ist schwarz, im Licht leicht rötlich schimmernd mit feinem beigem Schaum. Schon das Starkbier ist aromatisch, hier ist es nochmals etwas intensiver. In der Nase zeigen sich schon deutliche Kaffee- und dunkle Schokoladen-Noten. Diese sind auch geschmacklich dominierend und werden von schönen Aromen von getrockneten Früchten, etwas Lakritze und einer feinen Rauchnote ergänzt. Tolles Bier!","North Rhine-Westphalia, GERMANY","McSherman"
