1413,"2017-05-09",3.9,"0.375 l bottle from Biertraum, best before December 2016, cellared for about two years. Clear, very dark ruby with a thin, frothy, almost stable, off-white head. Sweetish, malty, boozy and slightly fruity aroma of lots of whisky, vanilla, caramel, raisins, figs and some oak. Very sweet, malty, slightly fruity and a bit boozy taste of caramel, molasses, raisins, prunes, vanilla, oak, some honey and whisky, followed by a long, sticky-sweet, moderately bitter, warming-alcoholic and minimally woody finish. Medium to full body, creamy to oily mouthfeel, soft carbonation. Quite complex, not too boozy but lots of barrel character. Great sipper, really well-made, just a bit too much whisky maybe for me.","Hagen / Bonn, GERMANY","Zlotta"

Sweet, crazily boozy aroma, malty but with some sharp berry skins. Hazy red, small head. Sweet and heavy in the mouth, some heat. Woodiness is nice, but this is way too boozy.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

1413,"2016-12-03",3.2,"Overpriced beer tasting 2016. 375ml bottle, shared by Rasmus, thanks! Murky brown beer, small head, kinda looks like bog water. Nose is malty, a bit farty, spice and nutty notes. Flavor is boozy, warm, nutty dryness, malt, barrel notes. Tannins in the finish with berry notes. Kinda odd.","ESTONIA","suurjuust"

A bit too sweet, but still very good.","Tel Aviv, ISRAEL","DSG"
1413,"2015-12-19",3.8,"375ml bottle [11.8% abv]. Opaque, grey-ish dark brown colour with average, thick, frothy, half-way lasting, moderately lacing, beige head. Woody, malty aroma, notes of toffee, hints of oak, a touch of treacle and vanilla in the background, herb candy. Taste is almost cloying, sweet malty, hints of treacle, molasses, vanilla, toffee, a slightly oaky touch, some herb candy and cordial, raisin; hop bitterness keeps the sweetness arduous at bay, warming alcohol reaches upper stomach regions. Decent sipper with nicely developing herbal profile.","Bielefeld, GERMANY","Idiosynkrasie"
1413,"2015-12-17",3.5,"Bottled, unsure of date, at Festivus 2, 12/12/15.Beige head sits at cover atop a dark amber-mahogany body of undetermined clarity.One of the employees said, upon me inquiring about this beer, ""Do you like bourbon barrel barleywines??!?!"" So, I almost didnt try it, but glad I did. Brown sugar, whiskey spiciness and signature rich, fruity, caramel notes arise in the nose. Vanilla, toasted oak and tons of barrel character, but the beer itself is strong enough to handle the barrel treatment and it dosent come across unbalanced. Alcohol definitely provides some heat, but again, is not obnoxious.Brown sugar, light raisins and plentiful caramel all announce a fairly expected Uerige malt monster character. Sweet, rich but transitioning through the middle, via vanilla, oak and spicy, somewhat dry whiskey character, to a decidedly much more dry, less fruity finish with tons of nutty barrel tannins. Still, you cant keep a good melanoidin down, and fruitiness/berries/light acidity linger on, as well as some appropriate alcohol warmth. The maltiness is fun, I guess, but I dont find any particular compelling character here.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
