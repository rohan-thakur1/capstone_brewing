3012,"2014-04-10",2.7,"Bottle as I battle through sleep deprivation and watch endless hours of tv. Pours straw yellow with nose of sweet rice. Tastes of pear, raisins, rice, way sweet simple syrup, some wet wood, and heavy cream. Odd one but Im a sucker for these small sake bottles.","New York, USA","Jow"

3012,"2014-02-14",1.4,"Bottle, 30cl. Courtesy of Cunningham. A clear, oily, flat sake. Alcoholic, cheesy nose with some rice water. Fruity. Its warming and full bodied, slightly oily, with mature cheese, rice water, canned pears and some higher alcohols. Not very good this one. 140214","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

3012,"2013-08-16",0.9,"Horid. Smells like cleaning chemicals and diapers. Just bad. Taste is water but sugary. This is bad. Significant lighter fluid taste. Dump

3012,"2013-01-08",2.5,"Crystal clear. A very perfumy nose. Very dry with a mold-like flavour to it. Not inconsiderable acidity. Very light and with obvious alcohol.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Alphadelic"
3012,"2010-11-19",3.4,"Bottle.  Pours a clear very light straw yellow.  Woody and sweet aromas, fruity with some sweet rice cake aromas, daifuku I think they are.  Medium bodied, a little minerally and oily.  Smooth and silky at first, slightly sweet.  Dries out big time and ends with slow warming alcohol on the finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
3012,"2010-02-26",3.5,"Clear liquid, very nice lacing. The aroma is reminscent of playdough with a grassy fruity undertone. The flavor has lots of pear, and spice. Grass shows as well, with hints of banana, vanilla, cedar, cheese, and a spicy finish. Very nice!","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","hobbersr"
3012,"2010-02-26",2.2,"An interesting idea a unpasturized sake. Smells sweet and yeasty a lot more character than I was expecting. Flavour is sweet and fresh with notes of plum. and it hardly has any of that feet flavour i have come to expect from sake. I say Very Good!",", Alberta, CANADA","Cole"
3012,"2010-02-26",3.5,"Bottle. Pours clear, massively aromatic nose: pears, mushroom, anise, earth, brown rice, nice fruit and earth character. Delightful-tasting as well, very full-bodied and rich, a lovely sake.","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","Savvy1982"
3012,"2010-02-13",3.4,"Bottle  This bottle of sake completes my exploration of every style of beer, cider, mead, ice cider and sake listed on ratebeer.com Pours as clear as water (thats some polished-assed rice) and even after several twirls around the glass, provides little to no coating or legwork. The aroma is ultra-fruity  mostly plum and pear. Medium-bodied with a watery, slightly slick mouthfeel. The flavor is fruity, much like the nose; also, pleasantly sweet and easy drinking. The high ABV sneaks up on you rather than slapping you upside the head. Finishes easygoing and sweet with moderate dryness at the very end. Thanks to dchmela for providing me with a bottle of this elusive style of rice beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3012,"2010-01-25",3.5,"Pours clear with just a hint of yellow. Nice lacing. Slightly grainy rice, yeast and a touch of fruit aroma. Taste is light rice and dry fruit, with a big fruity aftertaste. Nice and light.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
3012,"2009-11-21",2.9,"Clear, no legs. Sweet and fusel aroma. Taste is sweet and a bit salty. Fruits. Burn and thin.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
3012,"2008-12-07",3.2,"Clear, just off water, a few suspended bubbles and looks viscous. Koji aroma, almost yogurty but not sour, and has apples. Nice thick but not sticky. Silky smooth mouthfeel. Clean finish is simple, earthy but with alcohol punch at end.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"
3012,"2008-12-03",2.4,"Clear.  Koji aroma is huge, almost almondy, with wood and alcohol.  On the palate it is a bit hot and unbalanced.  There is some koji but it is also quite minerally, with a slightly vegetal character as well.  Sweet, mild finish as it warms.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
3012,"2008-09-24",3.4,"Sampled 9/24/2008. This Namasake pours a slightly yellow color from a 300ml screw top bottle. No head. The aroma is subtle, hints of vanilla, melon and alcohol. Medium bodied. It starts sort of sweet with lots of melons (cantaloupes and honeydews) some bamboo and floral flavors. It kind of reminds me a little of gin, ort of in the feel of the flavors more than anything else. Very clean and smooth. There is only a touch of alcohol bite noticeable at 15%. Very nice. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet with a touch of alcohol.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
3012,"2008-02-24",3.3,"Sample from a Sake Flight at Fuji Jade Garden, State College, PA. Aroma has an edge of bamboo, water chesnuts and light sulfur. Pours a distinctly yellow-tinged clear. Flavor carries a stronger, more distinct flavor. Im not sure how I feel about it. Yeast profile is up, with plant and mineral distinction. Gourd rind. Stays smooth, but the character in this beer isnt particularly desirable.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3012,"2007-11-27",2.9,"Bottle from Kingdom Liqour, FL. Served cold. Poured clear color with good legs. Light rice alcohol aroma. Light to medium body with a dry texture. Light green apple sweet flavor with a light sweet alcohol finish that was of short duration. Soft drinkable sake.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3012,"2007-05-25",2.8,"10 ounce bottle purchased from the Davis Food Co-Op.  This is my first Nama Sake.  Chlorine-coconut rice like aroma.  Some mildly ethanolic notes are definitely present as well.  Smells like pool water, not pool toys.  Seriously, this looks like water.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Hydrogen hydroxide.  Hey now, this has a sweet, sugary flavor to start.  This is sweeter than any of the other sakes Ive had.  This sweetness gives way to a dry, very medicinal flavor.  The aftertaste on this is not unlike Robitussin.  For a sake, this is somewhat reasonable, but it is not something that Id ever buy again.  Yes, I am a ratings whore.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"
3012,"2007-05-25",3.5,"Clear syrupy body. Sweet vanilla and rice aroma. Sweet syrupy vanilla flavor with some light fruit and a nearly creamy mouthfeel.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","maniac"
3012,"2007-03-04",2.7,"The aroma has rice, vanilla, wood, alcohol, fruit, and milk chocolate. The appearance is clear-yellow and very still. The flavor is earthy with all the elements from the aroma. The palate is thin like most sake but is also lightly oily. The finish is warm with alcohol and dry. Overall I like this one because its sweet up front but dry in the end. It also has complex elements that are all very subtle. It is just as good cold as it is hot.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
3012,"2006-04-19",2.8,"My first sake rating and first sake. Looks like wine. Just a yellow tint. Aroma is also wine-like with alcohol, apple and, mellon notes. I prefer beer beer but sake may be a bit of an aquired test similar to some beers. Very smooth. Reminds me of warm vodka with some interesting side flavours. Dry fruit up front and nut oil finish. I would prefer more fruit but maybe I am comparing to wine.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
3012,"2006-02-19",3.3,"First sake Ive ever rated and only about the 3rd or 4th time Ive ever had it.  Totally clear like water.  Delicate fruit aroma, light alcohol.  Interesting flavor, sweet, slightly alcoholic.  This is good, but I dont know how to describe it very well, as I am an inexperienced sake drinker.  This is very good and drinkable, and better than any other sake Ive had (as far as I can remember).","Portland, Oregon, USA","BobbyW3363"
3012,"2005-10-26",3.1,"At Hayashi in Williamsburg.  Pitched the cucumber out of the little bamboo serving cup.  Pours clear, a touch viscuous.  Faint melon aroma.  Flavor was gently of melon, perhaps a honeydew.  Too bad I dont care for melon all that much.  No real off flavors, which was good.  Nice enough with the sushi, cut through the fatiness of the fish well.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"
3012,"2004-08-31",3.4,"Almost clear with hints of gold.  I thought that it smelled of summer fruit, but Lisa said ""nail polish remover"" - she took a whiff right as it was poured - maybe the alcohol bursts out then???  Anyway, palate was thicker than other sake Ive had, flavors are subtle, but I mostly got summer fruits - especially melon and cantaloupe.  This tasted really great with the fruit plate that Jeff put on the table!","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
3012,"2004-03-30",3.4,"UPDATED: NOV 30, 2004 Served slightly chilled in a GuinomiVery faint pale yellow but overall clear & pellucid. The fragrance is moderately assertive. Calm, fruity & floral, moist vanilla, unbuttered popcorn. The impact is very mild. Dry & Sweet flavor, subtle, but still more sweet than dry. Alcohol is very well hidden here, very smooth. Medium to light acidity. Presence is full. Good complexities surround the sense. Slight delicate earthiness. The tail stays around with a light alcohol sweetness like gin. Smooth and mild with good flavors. Try to get this one when its handled correctly and chilled in the store. I find it best in the winter.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3012,"2004-03-25",3.9,"Clear with slight greenish and whitish tinges. Fruity and herbal aroma. Fruity, herbal, and lightly sweet flavour with a nice bitter alcohol bite on the finish. Almost like a low alcohol gin or martini, but with the same full body and mouthfeel. Very pleasant.","Halifax, Nova Scotia, CANADA","OKBeer"
3012,"2003-12-28",3.4,"Man I don’t know how to rate this shit. All I can say is that thus far this is, if not the best sake I have ever sampled. This 300ml bottle cost me $7.50.
 Basically clear in appearance, Head- please, NONE! The aroma and flavor really reminded me of vanilla, rather sweet and delicate; Notes of peach and possibly some slender hints of apple and melons…. honeydew and cantaloupe. Very enjoyable for me, as I hope it was for others;  I will be buying this again. 
 Served chilled as recommended on bottle, but taste was more pronounced once warmed to room temperature.","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
