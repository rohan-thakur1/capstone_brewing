2092,"2014-08-19",4.0,"Pour came out a hazy yellow with a white head on top, looks like an ale that is blond, though Im not too experienced with the style. Tropical citrus on the nose presumably from the Centennial but perhaps from the yeast as well. Flavor is similar, a little less intense. Very easy drinking body, super smooth and right on the balance between light and airy and thick and chewy. Good stuff in a style that I (and presumably others, right guys?) tend to ignore.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ScipioA"
2092,"2014-08-15",3.7,"I poured a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. There was no freshness date and it cost $8.04 ($0.37 per ounce).

Appearance: Bright, lemon yellow hue over a hazy body. Large sediment particles can be seen floating in suspension. Pours to a large, white, foamy head which retains and laces well.

Smell: Clean lemony scent plus some spicy/herbal character as well.

Taste: The golden ale/blonde ale style is probably my least favorite in all of Beerdom. Its a deliberately bland style, so its difficult to find one thats interesting and flavorful. And while Lawsons Finest Liquids Knockout Blonde Ale isnt exactly a masterpiece, I will say its probably the best blonde ale Ive ever had.

This doesnt truly seem to conform to the blonde ale style, anyway. Theres a strong hop presence here (copious amounts of Columbus and Centennial hops, according to the label). Much like the appearance and aroma, theres a lemony citrus zestiness to be found. Not juicy or tart like lemon fruit, but drier and spicier like lemon peel. Theres an underlying herbal flavor as well (green tea), not quite as intense as Mosaic hops, but strong enough to notice. The malt component is, not surprisingly, mild and nondescript. Reminds me of a pale wheat ale (another boring style I dislike). Still, theres nothing off-putting about this palette whatsoever. The hops definitely make it an interesting brew. 

Drinkability: At 5% ABV, Lawsons Finest Liquids Knockout Blonde Ale is caught in the middle of two worlds. Its got plenty of body and flavor for a relatively strong beer, but at the same time its just a bit too heavy for what its going for. A tad too bitter to be truly refreshing, even though it finishes clean. I could see this recipe being reworked well as a session IPA or a true pale ale. But as an easy-drinking blonde its perfect for the summer.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
2092,"2014-07-30",3.8,"A nicely hopped golden ale. Aroma is slight and has hints of grass but not much else. The nose is more belgian and the taste american. Wonderful long taste from such a light beer. Hops more present on tongue than nose.","Madrid, SPAIN","CamdenD"

It pours a slightly hazy pale yellow with a tremendous head that simmers down while the carbonation bubbles continue to rise.  Hops are the most powerful sensation on the nose but otherwise it is nicely balanced between those hops and the biscuit malts and zesty citrus that accompany them.  The body is medium.  The taste starts out with a subtle graininess but then after a few sips the hops really creep up.  A nice beer.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
2092,"2012-05-20",4.0,"Picked this up at the amazingly great Warren Store in Vermont. Fresh Lawsons every Friday! Stuck it in the fridge. Enjoyed in a Hill Farmstead Glass at 50 Degrees F. Looks like Im the first person in 2012 to review this on RateBeer. Awesome!

A - Beautiful light golden color. Hints of orange. Crystal clear in appearance. SRM of 4 maybe 6. Vigorous pour produced a 1 finger head that was just a bit off-white, almost cream color with very tiny bubbles. I really enjoyed pouring this.

S - Very nice scent. Very much a wheat scent almost a very mild bock scent. Excellent hop scent. Cascade certainly dominates the hop profile in scent. Mild lemon scent on the back of my nose.

T - Nice! Very mild malts with a very wheat sort of backbone. I know this isnt a wheat beer but it has that taste that reminds me of a wheat beer. Of course the Cascade hops are there and Centennial but not in a dominating way.

M - 60/40 carbonation on mouth swish. Medium to light body. Excellent bitter finish that sticks around for a while.

O - Its been about 3 hours since I had an American Pale Ale as balanced as this and that was Hill Farmsteads ""What is Enlightenment"" This beer exudes balance with an excellent mouth feel that blows me out of the water. Great job Lawsons team!","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

2092,"2011-05-09",3.5,"A: The beer pours a clear golden color with a big, fizzy white head and some mild lacing.

S: This is a rather hoppy blonde ale, but it all seems to be European hops.  Intensely floral and earthy with some mild spice and herb notes to it.  A decent maltiness which provides some sweetness and a little bit of bread.

T: Herbal and floral hops provide a strong flavor initially and throughout the sip.  Pale malts and a light bread character give the sweetness to the beer.  Just a hint of bitterness is present on the back end.

M: Medium in body with a moderate to high level of carbonation.

2092,"2011-03-19",3.7,"Thanks to Conor for this one.

Pours a hazy golden yellow with a short-lived white head that recedes to a soapy cap and leaves delicate lacing.

Aroma is pretty hopped up for a blonde with some light lemony citrus hops as well as bready malts.  There are hints of juicy citrus like pineapple and grapefruit but theyre muted.

The taste starts with the light lemon zest and floral hops.  But theyre extremely light with some bready malts underneath.  The finish is clean and dry.

The mouthfeel is light bodied, crisp and highly carbonated, close to perfect for the style.

As a blond ale, this one is fantastic.  To be fair, its really hopped up for the style, but it still doesnt feel out of balance and I could drink this all night long.  A fantastic blond ale.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

2092,"2010-05-09",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
An admirable balance of citrusy, spicy hops and crunchy pale cereals moves into a delicious grassy bitterness, creating one of the most appetizing Golden Ales Ive ever had.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the misty blonde.
-The malt flavors are ever so lightly biscuity throughout.
-The hops also offer coniferous tips.
-If I can get my hands on a few more fresh bombers of this, my score might go up significantly. This was as satisfying as Hopfenstarks Ostalgia Blonde.

2092,"2010-01-20",4.5,"In short: A perfectly executed full bodied uber-hoppy thirst blonde ale.  Maybe the best thirst blonde ale/lager Ive had in North-America.
How: Tap at brewpub.
The look: Clear blonde body topped by a long-lasting medium white head
In long: It should be noted that this beer (at least this first batch) was guessed brewed at Zero Gravity by Sean Lawson, brewer/owner of the micro-brewery Lawsons Finest Liquids.  Nose is crisp and bright with dry grassy hops and fresh cereals.  Taste is all one can hope from a thirst golden ale.  The body is really full of cereals but remains very crisp and never sweet.  A tiny bit of honey.  This beer if hoppy, very hoppy, the hops are bright and sharp but never aggressive.  Superb sharp and dry bitterness.  A bit of lemon meringue adds just a tiny bit of tartness.  Superb dry finish.  The full crisp body and lively carbonation create a great mouthfeel.  You just cant put your pint down.  Except for a few (rare few) Czech pilsners consumed fresh on location this is probably the best thirst blonde ale/lager I have ever had.  The most impressive Knockout since How many fingers?
