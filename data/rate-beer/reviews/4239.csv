4239,"2011-09-17",3.6,"750 ml bottle shared by Dansting, Dan has been holding on to it for a little while to share with me, I highly appreciate it.  Its about 3.5 years old.  Its rare to come across a beer with cranberry that isnt a cheap as wheat.  Pours black with no head.  Aroma has a weird fruitiness, apparently cranberries but I wouldnt have guessed.   Its a very strong, fumy, and bitter smelling stout. Flavor is bitter on the black patent malts I would say.  Flavor just comes off as a strong stout and there is an non-distinct berriness, I would not call it cranberry.  I wonder how they crushed the cranberries, may have made a big difference.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
4239,"2011-08-23",3.7,"750 ml bottle shared by Dansting.  Pour is a darker brown with a thin light tan head.  Aroma is roasted smoked malt with a nice clean fruit cranberry shining through.  After the darker malts and tart cranberry clear a bit, the wood starts to shine through a bit with oakiness.  The taste is the nose, with a nice balance between the dark roasted malt and the tart cranberry fruit.  As it warms, the cranberry really comes to the front, which is pretty amazing given the age on this beer.  Palate is medium to full bodied, active carbonation and the finish dries out with barrel woodiness.  Interesting beer, glad I got a chance to try this one - thanks a bunch Dan!","Kansas, USA","theisti"

Aroma of cranberries, sweet malt, oxidation.  Some maple syrup, mild oatmeal cookies.  Very obvious oak barrel notes.  Pretty awesome flavor with mild tartness from the cranberries with the cookie sweetness of the malt.  Oxidation is also present, albeit mild.  Full bodied, an absolute pleasure to drink.

4239,"2010-08-16",4.2,"UPDATED: SEP 24, 2010 Tap. Got to try this beer at Great Taste of the Midwest this past weekend. What a treat. This beer poured a maroon reddish black color with a slight head. Surpirisingly the aroma was still very much of cranberries along with the traditional IS notes of dark roast. The taste is well balanced between the cranberry and dark stout flavors. No hop presence to speak of really. Medium mouthfeel. Not sure why but at this point I thought this beer would have gone down hill, not the case at all. Still very good and delicious.

4239,"2009-11-17",3.6,"Shared bottle that cellared quite well. Poured black/brown with ruby tones showing through, and a bubbly head that diminished so quickly that  it was hard to get a read on the color. I guess somewhat off white/light tan, leaving a very small ring, light film, and some spots of lacing. The aroma was tart dark fruit and a touch of vinous nature. The flavor was tart cranberries, only a hint of sweetness, dark chocolate, some moderate hop bitterness and a dry, slightly tannic finish. The alcohol didnt seem to show up.  As I said when this first came out for Surlys 2nd anniversary. A big fruit, novelty brew, that was enjoyable trying once.

Undertones of raspberry vinegar, honey, vanilla covered green apples, mouldy basement, wood, coconut and butter. The flavour is light sweet, light bitter and medium acidic with notes of tart cranberries, roast, wood, vanilla, butter, vinegar and hints of fruits. The mouthfeel is astringent and tart. Dry finish.

Nose shows significant malt depth, the heavy cranberry and imperial stout chocolate balanced nicely. The flavor is even more impressive, and though quite sweet, the incredible malt depth is never lost behind the sweet fruit and chocolate notes because the cranberry imparts a soft tart balance.

4239,"2009-07-27",3.5,"Bottle shared at Johns gathering. Poured a mahogany with a light tan head. Aroma is sweet dark fruits mixed with some roasty coffee. Flavor is surprisingly acidic following the aroma (though not so much considering the addition of cranberries) with some flavors of light chocolate acidic fruit dominating. Overall some nice flavors but I was not really crazy for the acidity clashing from the sweeter roastier flavors that would otherwise have comprised the the bulk of the flavor profile if it had not been for the cranberries.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

A touch of solvent. Pours a clearish black-brown, with a foamy head in creamy tan. Flavor has a brisk charred roast that marries with a touch of jellied cranberry sauce and some orange peel. The stout base seems a little thin. Theres a palpable dusty hop presence and some light plant stems. Alcohol well underlaid, with this tasting more like 6%. As a fruit beer, this is a pretty good stout. Honestly, this is probably a decent stout, but the fruit is just not a presence.

The aroma is an intriguing mix of dark roasted malts and some tart earthy cranberries. Initially sweet dark malts are followed by a good dose of roasted malts with a cranberry tartness that rounds it out.

Thanks to whomever brought this out.  Intriguing due to the cranberry aspect this one could be a stand out on a normal night.  If you are lucky enough to have one be nice and share.  Im sure you can make lots of friends that way.

Aroma / Appearance - Creamy sheets of lacing and no head gave this brownish black beer a nice texture.  Fruity with black coffee and malts in the forefront it makes itself known.

Flavor / Palate - Cranberry bread, coffee, and dark chocolate create a smooth experience.  The fruity finish sets it apart by providing a nice wrapping to a solid beer.  Hopefully this makes it to the GTMW in some form this fall.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

4239,"2008-11-20",3.5,"750mL bottle #165, courtesy of MeLikeBeer, poured into a snifter.

Pours a dark brown with ruby hints out of the bottle and settles in as an opaque black in the glass. The tan head is huge and shows great retention and leaves sheets of lacing.

The aroma has lots of tart cranberries with a strong balance of dark roasted malts and some sweet dark fruit. There is also some chocolate and a bit of wood as well.

The taste didn’t quite live up to the aroma for me. The tart cranberries didn’t meld with the malts and chocolate as well as the aroma suggested. It starts with a slightly bitter/sour berry taste that gives way to a toasted malt backbone. The finish has tons of the sour berries in it.

The mouthfeel is smooth but probably a little thin for me. It’s a bit dry as well.

This is one interesting beer from the folks at Surly but the taste just doesn’t quite come together for me. Nonetheless, big thanks to Brent for sharing this rare bottle.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
4239,"2008-10-30",3.3,"Sampled GABF 2008
Quite a dark, concentrated amber-brown color that is topped by a tan’ish frothy head.  This is very strongly aromatic, with lots of Bourbon-like notes (vanillin, coconut, a hint of butterscotch and some light spicy oak that kicks in towards the finish along with some nose burning alcohol).  There is a touch of non-descript fruit character underneath the strong barrel aromatics; definitely a bit too dominated by the barrel character though.

This beer is lightly tart somehow and not nearly as sweet or rich as I was expecting.  There is a spicy oak and alcohol burn that is fairly evident in the finish and is more dominant than the other barrel-like notes that I noticed in the aroma; there is a touch of butterscotch here though.  The beer is actually quite astringent, with a quite noticeable tannic quality to it in the finish.  The body is a touch thinner than I was expecting, though it certainly makes it more drinkable.  The noticed tartness adds / accentuates some flavors of tamarind, tart raisin, cranberry and sour prune (this last a product of the tartness and some rich malt notes).

This is not bad, but certainly not quite what I was expecting; the tartness and barrel character seem to mix in odd ways at times and it is missing the malt richness that could carry both notes a bit more.  I had no idea while drinking this beer that it had cranberries in it, but the tartness certainly makes sense now.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Yep, good!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"

Nose was pretty sweet with a good dose of tart cranberry, dark fruits, sweet roasted malt and a hint of chocolate.  Very sweet on the palate, but not overdone, with a good dose of ripe red and dark fruits accompanying the cranberry, chocolate, sweet roasted malt, and brown sugar accenting the tart cranberry character.","Farewell Minny; Hello Puyallup, Washington, USA","joebrew"
4239,"2008-01-28",4.2,"On draught at the Blue Nile during the Surly Two special early release party. Pours an opaque dark reddish brown brew with a thick and lumpy tan head that has excellent retention and sticky lacing. Aroma of roasted dark malt, dark pitted fruit, sour hops, dark chocolate, molasses and some tart cranberries. Taste is thick, full bodied, with flavors of sour dark malt, cranberries, dark chocolate and a touch of raspberries. Finish is tart and mildly bitter along with a dark roasted malt and cranberry aftertaste. Uff Dah! This brew reminds me of Surly Cranberry One, but much thicker in texture and taste.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
4239,"2008-01-25",4.2,"Appearance: Reddish black, with a dependable, sturdy cocoa head. Looks every bit the part for a cranberry stout.

Aroma is tart fruit, slightly sour, slightly sweet, ultimately dry, and very likable.

Taste: the tart grips the tongue first, snappy, fresh, fully flavored, and other elements lie underneath. Solid malt, abundant cocoa, dark malts in unfailing supply, but the cranberry flavor keeps bobbing on top and dominates the taste. Alternately sweet and sour, and then dry, still some roast felt below the fruit, making for a satisfying drink. Youve got to love the fruit, though, if you dont, its not for you.

Alcohol is barely evident, and despite being a hearty, full-bodied ale, the fruit aspect helps make this surprisingly refreshing. Easy to drink, but one to pause and ponder with...Id dig this if anyone made it, but its extra cool as an anniversary one shot from our local bad boys
...relax and enjoy...reflect on two years of great beer...happy 2nd, Surly! May you prosper through many more!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
4239,"2008-01-25",4.0,"On tap at the Nile. Dark dark brown with a large tan head that recedes fairly quick. Light but nice aroma of cranberry, some chocolate. Nice sweetness, finishes with a little tartness. Alcohol is very well hidden. Beautiful mouth feel.

4239,"2008-01-25",4.4,"(on tap at the Blue Nile) Pours black with a large tan head that never leaves.  Nice aroma of cranberry, cocoa, and some nice hops as well.  Taste is just amazing with a great balance between the chocolate and light roast flavors, and the tartness from the cranberry.  This mixture just dances on the tongue.  The finish is also remarkable with a lingering tartness with the cranberry as well as just a slight bitterness from the hops.  Full mouthfeel and perfectly carbonated.  Wow, this is one great beer.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
4239,"2008-01-25",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2008 [On-Tap] Pours black with a big tan head. Aroma is cranberry, chocolate, almost a light citrusy orange at times. Taste is cranberry, chocolate and light roasted malt. There is a little bitterness from the cranberry in there too, which is to be expected. Medium mouthfeel, long cranberry chocolate and malt finish. Smooth. Wow, what a beer. Amazingly unique and the flavors blend together so well. I was really, really impressed by this beer. Re-Rate: 9-5-9-4-18=4.5Re-Rate: After loving this beer the first time and then seeing some of the ratings that followed, I was left wondering if I had just gotten an exceptional keg or what. I have had it again and I liked it nearly as much. The palate was a bit thinner than I remembered it as being, but otherwise it was still an outstanding, unique beer.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"
4239,"2008-01-25",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2016 Original rating, 1-25-08: Approximately 10 oz. pour on tap at Blue Nile in Minneapolis at the official release on 1-23-08. Poured into a Maredsous glass. Fruit and chocolate sharpness in the aroma. Plum, perfume, cream, sweet cigar tobacco, and peach scents. The aroma becomes quite sweet upon multiple sniffs. I do smell the cranberries, but I dont necessarily smell them as cranberries. Pours an opaque dark brown with a moderate to large amount of peach-tan head. The head is soft in both color and texture, and it contains large bubbles. Produces pleasant, extensive lacing. The initial taste comes as an overwhelming but delicious cranberry explosion. Its like unsweetened, concentrated cranberry juice, slightly sour and remarkably tart and tangy. The underlying beer seems to be a stout with dark chocolate and light coffee flavors. The stout flavors emerge only upon multiple sips, after the initial cranberry shock subsides somewhat. Its almost like two beers in one: First, its a New Glarus-like hardcore fruit beer (think Belgian Red or Raspberry Tart but with cranberries). Its not quite as fruit-intense as New Glarus legendary brews, but its pretty close. Second, its a cranberry-tinged strong stout. Interesting, dry, earthy aftertaste that is hard to describe. Medium to heavy body. Smooth and soft in the palate. Surly two is a complex, uncompromising, delicious beer. It may be my second-favorite Surly product, behind only Darkness. 8/4/9/4/17. Re-rate, 3-20-16: Re-brewed version. 4 oz. pour, on tap at Surly Beer Hall in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Consumed on 3-12-16. Pours an opaque, dark brown with an almost purple hue (actually an amber hue toward the end). Large amount of medium-lasting, taupe head. Good, thick, extensive lacing. I love the color and head. Its hard for a beer to look better, except that the head could last longer. Dark-chocolate-covered raisin scent. Really lovely, roasted maltiness in the aroma. Scents of cranberry in the form of craisin as well as chocolate. Smells great. Flavor features dark chocolate with a tart, cranberry bite. Roasted dryness and delicious, tart, cranberry finish. Dusty. Fresh cranberry as well as cranberry sauce. Orange. Full body. Smooth and almost oily in the palate. Lively. Very good palate effects. Excellent, much as I remembered it. This beer was ahead of its time. Im so glad to get another taste. Delicious! 8/4/9/4/17. Combined rating: 8/4/9/4/17","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

4239,"2008-01-25",4.1,"Tap at the Nile.  Pretty tart, but not overally sweet, which was nice. Slightly hoppy afterbite. Doesnt seem like a 9% brew at all. Very smooth, and the cran dominates all, and I found it to be on the same vane as the NG Belgian Red and Rasp. Tart. Not bad company to be in. awesome","Woodbury, Minnesota, USA","incutrav"
4239,"2008-01-25",4.7,"mmmmmmmmm. this is good. tap at the nile on the 24th. great deep color with hues of red mixed in. ultra creamy head that laces like a champ. starts very smooth, but very complex as well. slight sweetness up front but fades very quickly to tart, sourness, but not overly so. i was a big fan. some subdued hoppiness towards the back side, but dont last long once the tartness from the cranberry attacks the palate and hangs on for a while. great beer. excellent sipper. Would be great with fat steak and baked taters!!","Minnesota, USA","Mrthirstyneck"
4239,"2008-01-24",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2008 Had this on tap at the Blue Nile.  Very rich dark brown color with a nice two finger thick light brown head.  Chocolate as well as dark fruit on the aroma.  A bit of citrus hops in flavor but very faint.  There is a definite dark fruit flavor here that I cannot quite pinpoint, but it lingers a while after.  Nice complex brew.","Coralville, Iowa, USA","KAF"
4239,"2008-01-24",3.6,"Tap Blue Nile- My second beer release at the Nile. Great place and nice to be able to spend time with Todd. Really nice guy. 
Apperance reminds me of Surly One- quite dark with a cocoa head. Smell is of dark fruit. Wow- I just got smacked in the head with a cranberry. The palate is ultra silky smooth and goes down like velvet....but....I....just....cant....get...past. I let it warm for a while and still felt that the intense tartness of the cranberry dominated. I tried to think of it as a super hoppy beer where the malt is overshadowed, but I didnt work. A bit too much tartness for me. Long live Surly!","Mt Kisco, New York, USA","Brewso"
4239,"2008-01-24",3.5,"Pours with a huge creamy light brown head, dark red muddy body.  The head reminded me of hot cocoa.  Aromas of spruce and grapefruit, later aromas of cranberry became much more prevalent......medium body with an oily texture that I did not care for.  Flavor was impressive but does not translate to me necessarily liking it, cranberry at the start, tart in the middle and a hoppy ending.","Savage, Minnesota, USA","PGA324"
4239,"2008-01-24",4.2,"a deep purrple brown color with faint head.  Dark fruits chocolate and cranberries on the nose with a little spice. Body was thick and chewy with sweet malts a wonderful sourness and a cranberry bite at the end.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
4239,"2008-01-24",4.8,"The Blue Nile may have run outta traditional serving glasses while trying to get everyone in the place a glass of this wonderful brew but the Blue Moon pilsner glass I got will do just fine. Pours a deep brown/black with a slight purple hint when held up to the light. Nice fairly thick foamy brownish head sits atop the beer and sticks to the walls of the glass as you drink it down coating them nicely. Smells of smooth malt with a hint of creaminess. The cranberries come through nicely and have a bit of a bitterness. Allowed to warm a bit, a nice bit of chocolate comes out. Mmmm. Very smooth and malty body with a medium carbonation. Hint of light caramel and chocolate in the distance. The cranberries are great. Sweetness that is shortly followed by a bit of bitterness and a touch of sourness. Alcohol isnt present in the taste and this one goes down very smooth. Some commented that they could drink only one glass but Ill be back for plenty more.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","WankerWeasel"
4239,"2008-01-24",4.2,"Tap at the Blue Nile.  Burgundy and oak hued pour.  Deliriously complex malt and fruit aroma.  Rich swaths of caramel, port and brown sugar smother the nose in front with a delicious alcoholic warmth.  Drying out quickly and getting tart with tannic berry skin.  Caramelized sugar on cashews and hazelnuts, with lots of cocoa dust; plenty of green leafiness, unripened mango and apple skin.  Salty, aged cheddar in a flash.  Really weird, intriguing, and altogether pleasant.  Flavor brings the rich, maple syrup, raisin, and honey with a juicy cranberry and black cherry coating to start; this tends to be very much like a fruity syrah or temporanillo in its bold, jammy tartness.  Hints of raw almond, cinnamon, lemon zested goat cheese, lavender, and the tart bitterness of an apple seed, layering a lighter sweetness over the original elements.  Brilliantly sour, earthy, and completely collected.  Palate is lucid, rounded, and medium to full in body; chocolatey, and very smooth.  Rich, with a butterscotch and molasses pulse at the finish, but finalizing with a great and simple tart quality.  Theres a lot of Cuvee de Tomme in this one, which was a lovely surprise; its a beautiful, expertly crafted beer.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
4239,"2008-01-23",3.9,"Draught, release party at the Blue Nile, Minneapolis. Rich, malt aroma. Unique. Some hops. Really nice. Fully opaque body. Light brown head. Dishwater lace. Salty brew as to be expected from cranberries. Somewhat sour. Improves as it warms. The cranberry particles settle to the bottom and enhance the flavor as you reach the bottom of the glass. Perhaps not my favorite of Surlys brews, but a clearly quality effort within the style, showcasing Todd Haugs considerable talent as a brewer. You should seek this brew out as it is considerably different than any Surly brew youve had or likely will have for some time.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
