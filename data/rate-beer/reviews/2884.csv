2884,"2017-06-09",4.6,"2016 bottle. This is an incredible beer. Im biased, since I love Hill Farmstead and Florence is my favorite saison that they make. However, this is impressive in its own right. Its subtle and seriously restrained. Theres a lot of funk smell, with that characteristic HF complex yeast aroma, but the taste is extremely light and balanced. The funk aroma drops away, leaving a bit of acidity, a bit of oak, and some nice lemon flavor. It doesnt try to beat you over the head with a huge wine barrel flavor or a ton of heavy Brett funk; instead, this is light and complex, and really wonderful.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

2884,"2016-08-29",4.3,"Sample shared at 1st Lambic & Sour Sunday (at Bierhalle Deconinck in Vichte). One of Hill Farmsteads classic farmhouse ales, intended as a saison, but soured with wild fermentation agents and ageing on wine barrels so in practice a true New World sour ale rather than a genuine saison. Moussy, bubbly, snow white head, hazy straw blonde colour with a lime greenish hue, looking a bit like a witbier. Aroma has a wealth of fruity and funky impressions: sour cream, yellow raspberry, vanilla-like oak, lime zest, butter, soggy white bread, dry hay, white grapes, yoghurt, gooseberries... Tart, very fruity and estery flavor, lots of green plum, ripe gooseberry, peach, pear, spritzy but perfectly dosed carbo, supple and smooth, bit creamy mouthfeel. Lemony sourness cuts through it all without being sharply acidic; bready core, soapy wheatiness evident, rounded and complexely and dryingly tart finish with ongoing juicy fruitiness as well as drying wood notes, light wine flavor after swallowing. Beautifully balanced and delicate beer, but as said, much more a modern sour ale than a classic saison.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

2884,"2016-03-16",4.2,"Bottled 2016 01 12 and rated as an American Wild Ale, so not to upset scores on here too much.
This was poured into a tulip. 
The appearance was a hazy burnt yellow to orange color with a one finger white foamy head that quickly dissipated leaving some light messy lacing sliding right on into the beer. 
The smell takes on a quick sour grape to bitter grapefruit and then a subtle grapefruit, semi-sweet grassy contour. Beautifully floral and then a lemony sweet to bitter aroma.
The taste takes on the same aroma roaming into a florally bittersweet dry aftertaste and finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light allowing the sourness to hit as a good penetrator for the harshness. 
Overall, when one rates this as an American Wild Ale, youll see HF will knock it out of the park. Saison, ppff, no way, man, who put that on here? I hope youre embarrassed.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

2884,"2015-08-07",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2017 Batch 6 magnum shared by Adam on 7/25/15, with some really enjoyable kid rock playing in the background....sigh.Just a crazy stupendously perfect appearance. Lightly hazy brass with just huge, dense, well-retained, white head atop.Mossy, very earthy plant-like character in the nose is complemented by sulfur/poop-like yeast/bacteria notes that are quite enjoyable. Very nice and restrained on the barrels, no huge wine character and not a ton of tannin dullness. Love the stinky, funky nose and the beer seems very appropriately named. No alcohol or flaws.Soft, gentle floral notes and cornflower-like delicateness creeping in between the moderate acids and light maltiness. Lilacs, mangoes, pineapple, honeyed maltiness and some dry, grainy wheat character. Nice balance on the sweetness/dryness and a fairly thick body. In that sense, the ""thickness"" or ""fullness"" from the wheat, the extra body or chewiness from the barrel tannin and the creamy-full texture from the carbonation dont really go together, I dont think, but its still awesomely flavorful and its ok that it drinks a bit bigger than it actually is.Well, I guess Im officially in the Hill Farmstead superfan club, but then, Ive always thought very highly of Shauns brewing (see my reviews for his saisons from his days at the Shed, if you care). These ""saisons"" are awesome, regardless of how you feel about style guidelines and what is a ""true saison"". Im not afraid to admit how good they are and jump on the bandwagon with my high reviews. They really were almost unanimously awesome. Adam aging them in a cool cellar for a year via a magnum (which reduces oxidation) certainly didnt hurt either.-End Justification for why I like beers I like.  8/5/8/4/17750mL bottle, B6 again, drunk 11/5/16.With some more time to develop, this has developed more funk, mineral and even sulfur.  Its qute sublime, not overly sour, and still shows plentiful body/texture for 18 months of age.  I love the Flora series in all its iterations and the base beer is no exception.

Flavor is dry white grapes in the front of the sip with the Florence wheat base. For me personally Florence is my favorite HFS brew. This puts that base beer into another tier of flavor. Dry white grapes, light oak funk, wheat and a nice mellow tartness makes this a perfect summer brew. Simply fantastic, no need to ramble on. Like white wine? Like wheat based brews?

2884,"2013-10-02",4.9,"Batch 3 and batch 4 bottles, about a week apart, poured into a Hill Farmstead glass. Flavor profiles and review notes were checked and were nearly identical for both batches.

Pour: A hazy, glowing light orange with a nice two finger white fluffy head. Head is pretty sticky and leaves very nice lacing. Body is quite radiant. 

Smell: Tart lemons and pear skin up front, followed by a light funk and light breadyness. Some white wine notes in there as well. A really nice oak comes through as it warms. 

Taste: Tart lemons, pear juice up front, and a white grape must. A light funk, and some bready sweetness. A little bit of oak towards the finish really rounds everything out. Finishes tart with lemon juice and is quite dry.

Mouthfeel: Insanely drinkable. The beer is supremely refreshing. Very juicy, yet equally dry. Begs you to have another sip right after the first.

Overall: This beer is perfect. More simplistic, yet more elegant than Juicy. More drinkable and flavorful than Civil Disobedience #5. Fantastic. If any difference between batch 3 and batch 4 were to be noted, batch 4 had a slightly greater wine barrel presence, potentially due to the longer maturation in the barrels","Chicago, Illinois, USA","cfrances33"

Flavor was fairly tart with some light yoghurt and lactic acid character. Medium citrus notes with some light wheat character. Light phenolics. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium carbonation. Low acidic astringency and low alcohol warmth. Tart but also some creaminess from the wheat.
Overall a fairly nice, tart saison. The tartness kind of hides the water qualities that I think make the saisons so special, but it also adds a nice complexity to the beer.

Nose is impressive, lots of brett, some lemon zest, a bit of pepper, floral yeast, and a bit of earth.  Feel is excellent, light, crisp, dry, frothy.

2884,"2012-04-09",4.4,"750ml bottle, marked with a hand-written ""3"".  Not sure what that means.  The pour yields a gorgeous, lightly hazy, golden-amber body strewn with ultra-fine streams of effervescing pinpoint bubbles.  A smooth, lightly spongy head of pure white foam recedes very slowly, never fully dissipating.  Ultimately, a paper thin center film leads to a slightly ramped-up edge, leaving tall, tattered splotches of lace all over the glass.  Pretty much a picture perfect brew.The nose is shockingly good.  It smells of the perfectly balanced and complex essence of expert barrel-aged saison craftsmanship.  Fresh-cut malted wheat is robust.  Softly buggy farmhouse yeast is dry and dusty.  Wisps of lightly peppery flower petals meet remnants of pungent grassy hops.  And then theres the barrel influence.  Oh that barrel makes everything even better.  Soft Pinot Noir tannins lend a fruity, aromatic bite, and lambic-esque lacto-citric acidity keeps things wild and dry.  Tart, buggy, woody, sharp...it simply smells amazing.The flavor is also exceptional.  Wheat plays such a prominent role...probably more so than in any other saison Ive ever had.  The cereal-esque base is so distinct, and it works beautifully with the slightly dank grassiness of the hops.  Nips of tart, tangy lemon and dried pineapple meet dusty wildflowers, wild farmhouse yeast, and funky, woody barrel bugs.  Acidity slices right through the ever-so-slightly creamy malts.  Damn tasty stuff.  Not as mind-blowing as the aroma, but great nonetheless.The palate?  Its dry, dusty, and zippy, with a moderate body and a crisp finish.  The only downside is a a hint of papery character that is easily overlooked.  I drank the bottle over the course of a few hours with tremendous joy.  This is an excellent freaking beer.  Look...the case is pretty much closed.  Shaun Hill brews the best saisons in America...maybe the planet.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

A - Pours murky golden yellow with a nice one finger tall white head leaving very light streaks of lace down parts of the glass.


S - Smells of typical saison funk, lemon, green apples, fresh cut grass, oak and some wet earth. Nothing too complex yet still very nice.


T - Starts off with some fruitiness - mostly citric fruit and fresh green apples - quickly giving way to hints of oak, grass, damp earth and plenty of chewy wheat. I was expecting a bit more funk, all tho I am not sure if it needs it. Finish is dry, lingering on the pallet long after consumption.


M - Light body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Fairly dry finish lingers on the pallet for quite awhile after each sip.


O - I had the base beer of this one and thought it was decent but this one is definitely an improvement on that one. The barrels really helped to round things out. Good stuff for sure.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

Flavor profile is totally fleshed out and is really vibrant at this young age, but its weird and a bit fucked.  Tastes like sweaty underwear all through the finish for a good 30 seconds.

The smell on this one is nice and delicate.  Wheat of course, floral hops, lemon, orange, white grapes.  Im used to barrels doing more but its done very little to this beer.

The barrel does a little but more in the taste.  The grape characteristics stick around more this time especially at the end and after taste.  Its a crisp delicate taste.  Once again lemon, wheat, citrus, and some nice tartness.  Not a overwhelming tartness, just a tad.  Lovely taste.

Mouthfeel is medium bodies, crisp, and well carbonated.  Carbonation smacks the lips.  Dry finish.

Really did enjoy this one.  Its refreshing.  The barrel doesnt do much here other than adding some grape characteristics and the wild yeast adds a slight tartness to it.  Nothing overwhelming here.  Just a nice balance of everything.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","drunkenpolack"

A - 1-Finger crystal clear head with cream like bubbles. The beer itself is golden to leather in appearance. Its a very hazy beer with some nice sediment floating around.

S - Wheat is the dominant scent followed by Kiwi, Mango and lots of grapes. Im getting really sweet green grapes.

T - In short, a carbonated Pinot Noir with wheat and bitter yeast. I love wine so this has those Pinot tastes in a very balanced way. The wheat in this beer is very apparent.

M - None of HFSs beers really take over your mouth with carbonation when you swish. This is no different. Solid mouth feel, light bodied and a pleasant white grape juice aftertaste.

2884,"2011-06-16",4.6,"750ml, batch 2(?). This was one of the best beers had on tap during Philly Beer Week 2011 so Im excited to try it in bottle form.

Pours a hazy pale golden orange color with golden yellow hues when held to a light and a large two finger frothy, pillowy white head. Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that leaves chunks of soapy lacing behind.

Slightly earthy aroma with subtle farmhouse funk from the saison yeast with hints of barn/wet hay. Additional funk from the wild yeast with hints of earth, grass and straw which are complimented by the oak barrel presence. Im not picking up much of a wine presence but the wheat elements of the beer stand out under all of the other things going on. Hints of zesty spice, notably pepper and love as well as some bready yeast, banana, apple, pear and lemon peel. Very complex nose on this beer.

Medium bodied but on the fuller end of the spectrum with a flavor profile thats almost as complex as the nose suggests. Dry, earthy and funky up front from the saison yeast giving off hints of hay, grass and straw which compliments the dry, funky wild yeast notes. These bugs create a funky effervescence thats more dry than tart. Think more like Orval than like Temptation. The wine barrel aging further compliments this component with dry toasted oak notes and a very slight vinous light fruit character. Again, Im not picking up much wine but there is a sweet fruit presence, mostly apple and pear and some noticeable wheat beer characteristics. Zesty spice notes, especially pepper and clove balanced by sweet citrus peel and a prominent bready yeast character that adds fullness to the body. Lingering dry finish.

Overall this beer is incredibly complex, well balanced and delicious. Its such a strange amalgam of flavors but it works really well here. These factors along with the low ABV make it incredibly quaffable. I have to stop myself from pounding down the whole 750 too quickly. I was a little skeptical of Hill Farmstead at first but Im quickly coming around after drinking this Galaxy and Double Citra. Highly recommended!","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

2884,"2011-04-23",3.2,"A generous white foam decorates the gently hazy pale gold. A pretty fruity and funky nose with pleasant bretty tones, but less pleasant barrel gone wild notes of acetone and bee wax. The barrel provides a greasy, buttery vanilla side that I dont dig much, but fortunately, its only a facet among many others. The Pinot remains subtle, you could call the nose grapey, but with the butteryness, Id have thought more along the lines of a California Chardonnay. The fruitiness takes more of a citrusy twist, providing soft lemony flavours that gently complement the gentle floral  hop nuances. Earthy and leathery palate with a fairly funky presence that remains in check. Unagressive carbonation, especially after the beer has settled down for a few minutes, its thin-medium body and focused dryness ensure good drinkability. Some very interesting elements but Im hesitant. For a 5.5% Saison, it is fairly complex, particularly for a beer that deploys just a touch of tartness rather than outright acidic complexity and dry palate... yet there are some aromatic components in there that I would just prefer to do without. Id gladly try again as these wild beasts can legitimately vary, but Id empty the shelves of Hill Farmsteads Art before!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

2884,"2011-04-17",3.5,"750ml. 2011, batch 2 (not corked); I think this spent an extra couple of months (2-2.5) in the barrels. Opened on April 10, 2011.

Pours a faded goldenrod with a one inch frothy white head. Decent lacing and nice clarity on the first pour.

Pleasant, clean nose featuring a light citrus tartness, barely-present oak, unadulterated, fresh wheat and just a hint of earthy funk. Somewhat floral. Quite nice.

Similar to the nose, though softer. On the front of the palate theres a nice blend of lemon, white wine/white grape, and wet hay, giving way to a light grassy and floral bitterness. Mid palate theres a strange, almost sulfuric [mineral acidic] note Im not fond of that persists through the finish. 

Medium-light bodied, though characteristically creamy and pleasantly dry. Just a little watery on the finish. 

All the notes are here, they just dont come together for me at this point in the beers life. A nice balance of citrus, wheat, and grass/earthiness, especially on the nose, but theres a distracting flavor or two that will hopefully fade in the coming months.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

2884,"2011-02-21",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2012 My Bottom Line:
This Barrel-Aged Saisons subtle coniferous wilderness dallies alongside delicate flower petals and wine barrel fruitiness, as invigorating citrus and wheat fade into a dry, tart finish. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sizeable head of foam decorates the top of the shiny pale gold.
-The unusually prickly effervescence (for a HillF brew) enlivens the soft, dry mouthfeel.
-This smells like a cousin of Jolly Pumpkin but, for now, it is not as tart or expressive in its wilderness. This is much more drinkable and approachable for those who would like to discover wild yeasts.
-The restrained bitterness and quiet hoppiness in the finish make for a clean, uneventful finish.
-Wheat almost takes over in the second half of each sip.
-This has evolved wondrously over the last year. I dont know how long Id keep aging it, but a year has given it even more room to express itself.
