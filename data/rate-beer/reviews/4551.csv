Somewhat grassy and earthy with some malts tossed in. The taste is a hair dry. Touch of sweetness to it. Earthy notes with some malts. Nice and refreshing.","Granby, Connecticut, USA","boto"

4551,"2011-05-09",3.4,"UPDATED: OCT 29, 2015 Draught in Newark.  Pale golden pour, good strong bitterness, diesel aromatics of grass and flowers, soft-bodied and smooth, a touch too sweet but still worthy of ten pints. [2011.05.09: 3.8]
Tap in Maple Shade.  Clear, rich golden with a creamy beige head and lace.  Has some sickly sweetness on the finish and after, need to dry this out a bit, tastes vaguely of caramel toothpaste.  Fizzly and seemingly crystal-heavy, light-medium body  would be a great step-up for the Sam Adams drinker.  [3.2]  Drinks much better by the pint than by the sampler [2015.10.29: 3.4].","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
4551,"2011-04-03",3.5,"On draft at the Newark location. Full golden to straw color, nice carbonation bubbles on steady rise/display. The aroma was grainy, cereal, bready, grassy, sweet. The flavor followed, too much malty sweetness for a pilsner, but enjoyable. There were fruity berry type notes in this too, not quite as clean as desirable. Mouthfeel was full body with good carbonation, slightly sticky afterwards.","","User37895"
