Thin but moussy, egg-white, thinly lacing head, hazy straw blonde robe with lemon yellow-greenish hue, same colour as a Belgian witbier. Delicate aroma of lemon zest, orange juice, soggy white bread, lime blossom, pink grapefruit, Thai basil, yellow curry, stewed rhubarb. Rich and tropical fruity onset, passion fruit, papaja, green banana, softish carbo, lightly bready and somewhat soapy wheatiness in the middle, aromatic and delicate hoppy finish, lots of retronasal passion fruit and sweet exotic spices, mango, mildly but adequately bittering, drying a bit.

Fairly complex and sweet hoppy aroma. This has a lot of hops, but they don?t drown out the wheat, which comes thru clearly - nice! A touch astringent, but not overly bitter.

1504,"2015-07-31",4.3,"Pours a cloudy, vibrant sand-yellow color with a huge, froth head.

Features an intense hoppiness, defined by grass, citrus big times, with white zest qualities, tied together by floral, slightly sweeter yeast. Has hints of honey to it, adding to the hop appearance, making this more of a wheated ipa for me, as for the beers aromas. Which still build up a fantastic nose.

Has a medium, refreshing carbonation with a very smooth, yeast defined mouthfeel.

Tastes of dough yeast, immediately accompanied by wet grass and citrus peel. This gets balanced by bread, a hint of honey, ripe orange and a whiff of banana. Finishes with peppery spices, bitter citrus, slightly herbal hop presence and wild flower honey.

Features a great, hoppy wheat ale, which smells almost like an ipa. It tastes of a heavily hopped wheat ale though, mingling both flavors together in a great, interesting fashion. Very pleasant, enjoyable and complex, while exhibiting a unique flavor mixture.","GERMANY","aleigator"

1504,"2015-05-19",3.8,"32oz growler filled 5/15/15, drunk 5/16/15Hazy pour is a very pale, straw-tinged white gold with a large white head, well-retained.Fruity hops in the nose are fresh, strong and divulge little/no resin or even much heavy acidity. Light lemon and orange rind keeps things dry, while the malt yields only very soft honey and some dry, biscuity notes. No alcohol or flaws.I dont know how much to attribute the haziness to hop particle vs. this being a wheat beer, but it was quite free from any dirtiness, with only a touch of doughiness from the yeast and no blandness or astringency. The heavily fruity hops, with light floral and perfumey notes, really work with the very dry presentation of wheat and barley. Bitterness balance is near perfect here, providing just enough to clear the palate, but never fatiguing it. Soft texture with tight, creamy carbonation is icing on the cake and theres very little to fault here other than the slight doughiness.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
