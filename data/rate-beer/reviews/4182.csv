4182,"2017-01-23",3.9,"Bottle, courtesy of EuroSanta Cuso. Pours dark brown with a soft smooth foam. Aroma is light chocolate and coffee, quite roasty, but still as gentle as the foam promises. Medium body with a moderate sweetness and a soft texture. Very round and balanced. Palate continues like that. Some hints of the actual strength are there, but most of the ABV is well hidden. Great experience.","Zurich, SWITZERLAND","anstei"

4182,"2014-02-25",3.8,"Tap at RJ. Wonderful malty toasty bready caramely aroma with light fruits. These guys are becoming good at this. Clear dark brown colour, soft beige head, moderate duration. Taste is mostly malty, caramel, toasty. Moderate fruitiness, moderate alcohol poking out, but still bearable. Notes of coffee in the finish. Full body, chewy. Sipper, but good at that. Very good IMO.","Bratislava, SLOVAK REPUBLIC","Gurthnar"
4182,"2014-02-23",3.3,"BOTTLE 33CL from Cuso. Thanks, Imro!

Look: deep red-brown almost black with a mocha small frothy head with poor retention.
Aroma: yeasty with vanilla-like sweetness, licorice, chocolate, not too rich.
Taste: roasted malts, some hops, burnt sugar, sweet but not too sweet, body is quite light for 8 abv, a light acid note, a bit of phenolic touch but no alcohol.
For its big OG feels more like a tmavy on steroids than a bock.","Chișinău, MOLDOVA","dnicolaescu"
4182,"2014-02-18",3.4,"Malzig schokoladiger aber kaum süßer Antrunk. Intensiver und auch etwas süßer im Mittelteil, vergorenen bananig, wenig herb. Rundes, nicht übertriebenes Bier das durch Summe Vollmundigkeit gefällt. 10/11/10/10/7/11","Köln (Cologne), GERMANY","Koelschtrinker"
4182,"2014-02-14",4.2,"Ahhh. Sweet sexy Trnava. Bottle via Cuso the magnificent. Pours dark as a black steers raucous on a moonless prairie night. Small dark brown head. A dunkel as only that area of the world can perfect. Consumed whilst. Watching the female individual biathlon Olympics. And rooting for the smoking hot Slovak team. Strong nose of cocoa with a little dark roast thrown in for good measure. Body is full and abounds in dark sweet malts and cocoa. Finish is abrupt and final. Body is slick yet inviting. Some light raisin notes.","Hippetown East, New York, USA","coldbrewky"
