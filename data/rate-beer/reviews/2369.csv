2369,"2016-05-04",4.4,"Interesting tastes, blended with spicy almost cinnamon blends. A great tipple at Christmas! However it also has some bold flavours such as mango and citrus which one wouldnt normally expect to find in your average Christmas beverage","","DarkuntilDusk"

2369,"2014-09-27",4.4,"500ml bottle from Beer Gonzo, Coventry. One for the Citraheads. Cask-conditioned, slightly filmy orange gold collared with dense-lacing white. Riotous lychee, white grape, mango and tomato leaf aroma out of the very, very top drawer. Lush cashew and crackers base festooned with humid greenery, intoxicating night stock pollen and pulpy soft fruit; mango, papaya, melon,dragon fruit- theyre all in there. Crisp and bitter with a countering galangal and sherbet softness. Lurid tacky hop like licking one of those sticky little buds fresh off the bine. The rye feels inbuilt and wholly complementary. Celery, soapy flowers and tomato stem on the belch. Scant alcohol. Fucking magnificent.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"

Medium bitter taste, some malty sweetness. The rye gives the beer a bit more body than most of the other summer pale ales around. Good stuff.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
2369,"2014-07-27",3.9,"500 ml bottle-conditioned from somewhere in Bristol. Citrus marmalade, against a slightly confused grain base but another promising early days effort from this clever wannabe brewery.","Bristol, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","Tim Webb"
2369,"2014-06-07",3.7,"Bottle at Small Bar Bristol. It pours murky amber with a medium off-white head. The nose is bitter-sweet, strawberry cheesecake, tangerine, earth and brown bread.

I love the strawberry notes on the smell. Another winner from Wiper & True.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
2369,"2014-05-15",3.8,"Bottle from Corks of Cotham, Bristol. Slightly hazy amber, with a thin white head and moderate carbonation. Aroma of citrus fruits, with a touch of pineapple, grassy hops and earthy maltiness. Flavour of solid, and slightly spicy, rye, more sweetish citrus fruits, leading to a dryish finish. Excellent.","Bristol, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","downender"
2369,"2014-05-03",4.1,"Fanta notes on the nose built from a blend of lemon-juice citrus, gentle honey malts and the slightest hint of peppery rye. Pours a golden amber with a thin but firm head. The flavour is what I would expect from W&T - excellent. Ive had a lot of Citra beers of late - heck even Marks & Spencer are doing one - but I had no doubt that this crew would not be taking a pedestrian approach to it. The balance of the tropical fruits and orange juice from the Citra with the thick, malty sweetness from the rye malt is inspired, and results in a beer that is a worthy addition to the W&T stable. Are they the best of Bristols current crop of artisan brewers? Yes. Yes they are.","Bristol, Gloucestershire, ENGLAND","johninmelb"
