647,"2016-02-28",4.2,"Pours an oil black color with a decent, beige head. 

Smells of a lactic infused and roast covered maltiness, with a decent rock sugar quality atop. Its profound malt bill features a nice toffee note, together with a layer of melting milk chocolate.

Has a vivid carbonation among a medium, truly soft mouthfeel.

Smells of burned sugar among a subtle, delicate coffee roastiness, coated up by a lactic tart note. Exhibits a great sweetness, easily balanced by the profound malts and a huge amount of cream. Finishes with a bubbly carbonation among more caramel and a cream coated roast.

Very well made, perfectly composed beer with a nice twist between, roasted malts, soothing cream and tart milk. Very smashable, while producing a great flavor intensity.","GERMANY","aleigator"
647,"2016-02-04",4.0,"16 oz can from Eddie, the Tree House guy! The pour is a nice very dark brown/light black with a thin khaki colored head that falls to a light collar leaving a cool bat shape. The aroma is very sweet and milky. There is also a ton of chocolate and a solid roasted malt. It's sweet and sugary on the front end and quickly moves into a nice bitter chocolate roast. The flavor is really good. There is a sweet chocolate to it that compliments the milk sugar that is really nice. The bitterness hangs out until the finish, when the roast really comes in. The mouth feel is nice. There is a subtle soft carbonation and a lingeringly milky sweet aftertaste. It's a damn good milk stout, that's for sure!

647,"2014-01-19",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2017 Draught at the brewery, 1/18/14Light tan head tops an inky black body with some lighter dark brown edges. Well-retained, even for a sample. Seems to be opaque.Lactic-meets-chocolate nose evens out to produce a molasses aroma, with light roast and some definite vanilla-cream notes. Moderate strength of aroma, like how the lactose is apparent in the nose. Light anise notes and even some marshmallow flavors.  Toasted, bready malts. Quite a lot going on for a sweet sout.Sweeter than I would expect, based on the nose. Milk sugar and light prune vie for dominance, but the maltiness and sugars easily win. A bit watery on the end. More hop bitterness would go a long way here, as the very light roastiness and lactic notes are the only thing battling the sweetness. Drinkable, but I cant imagine having more than a pint of this. Then again, sweet stouts are a very strange style. How can you fault a ""sweet"" stout for being sweet? And it does have some interesting vinousness, as mentioned. Will revisit, as this brewery seems to be quite worthwhile.Can drunk 4/13/17.Quite nice and hides the lactose much better than any of the ""Shot"" series.  More roast and a bit lighter overall, with much less sugar and fudge.  Very nice and vastly outdid the Double Shot we tried earlier.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

647,"2013-12-08",4.1,"Pours black with dark brown highlights around the edges. Soft, khaki head. Its a thick blanket of small bubbles. Great lacing, good head retention. Lots of chocolate in the aroma with some gentle roast. Nice lactic edge. Loads of milk chocolate. The taste is similar. Its medium sweet with lots of cocoa flavor. The relatively mild lactic note keeps the beer from getting cloying. Plus, there is very little of the cola flavor that I tend to find a bit overbearing in other examples. Mouthfeel is creamy and gentle. They filled this growler right up to the top, leaving nearly zero head space, and the beer kept very well. Pretty much perfect for the style. Very impressive stuff. Im not the biggest milk stout fan, but this is just how I like them.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
