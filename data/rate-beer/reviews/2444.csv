2444,"2017-05-10",4.0,"750 ml bottle from The Party Source. Lovely shape and simple label, which states that the apples were harvested in 2015 and matured in calvados casks in 2016.

2444,"2016-01-24",3.9,"Bottle (750 ml) at home. 2013 bottle. Thanks to KCherney for this one! Split 4-ways. Almost clear bright golden with a small bubbly ring of white foam. Aroma was a bit dull at first with only some generic apple fruitiness but after 15+ minutes it opened up a lot letting the farmy horsey character out along Calvados spiciness and tingling alcohol. Taste is bright from the start with gentle tartness, a bit of residual sugar but nothing too much, lots of horsey character, the calvados spiciness is much more present here but not the boozy aspect. Body is medium. Carbonation is moderate. Mouthfeel is a bit tannic. Finish is dry, but much less than the Bordatto ciders we had just before. A very interesting product.

Kunde inte pricka in att den legat på calvadosfat, men nu när man vet om det var det lättare att känna. Perfekt ton med subtil calvados lyfter ytterligare en nivå. Jag är imponerad.

2444,"2015-09-06",3.8,"I tried this probably at my first ratebeer tasting, which was hosted by Paul. Drove from Staten Island to Jersey before Paul got upscale and moved on up to the Hoboken side. Or maybe it was a different Paul tasting. A Jersey RBian, who did not stay active long, shared this cider. At that time, it was pretty damn cool. Back then an upper teens cost of something was big money. I think we all appreciated the expenditure. Nowadays, its almost commonplace. I feel like this cider was much less available, definitely around but not overly common. I remember constantly seeing it at New Beer but never wanting to spend ""that much"" on a cider, even if it is barrel aged. Recently, I moved to Seattle and cider is big there, way bigger than anywhere else in the states. Maybe that is why I kept seeing this bottle for sale; much stronger visibility than I had been used to. I have been tempted to pick up a bottle especially given that the $20 price tag isnt really that large by contemporary standards. Fortunately, my uncle just brought this to a family gathering just for me. Hooray!.
I like Dupont cider, its the way I imagine cider should be done, effervescent, wild, not too apply, and not too sweet. However. these rules do not stand for ice ciders. This cider seems to be not wild, not effervescent but good, Why? because they make it a bit ice cider like with the calvados barrel. A bit of that heft from alcohol, sweet but worth sipping. Fun stuff but as an ice cider substitute as opposed to the regular Dupont lineup. See you again in 10 years cider.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

2444,"2014-12-13",3.8,"750 ml bottle.
As the top-rated cider on the site, I was eager to a hold of this one, >$20 pricetag notwithstanding. I saved it for a winter Saturday afternoon of writing, where I could savor the flavors over the span of a few hours. It opens with an ample puff and smokes for a moment. Poured into the long-stemmed tulip that I like for ciders, it immediately presents a vigorous churning white head that then disappears in seconds, leaving a rich gold liquid with the occasional trail of rising bubbles. 
 The aroma is complex. The oak from the calvados is present; of course apple but this element is actually relatively subdued; some unwelcome sulfuric notes; rotten wood, a touch of rubbing alcohol, the proverbial horseblanket. The flavor provides an interesting combination of gentle apple sweetness in the mid-sip with a dry tannic aspect later on. Wrapped around all of this are multiple layers of apple flavor: simple and light juice, musty cider, rich and somewhat sharp calvados. The combination is intriguing and far from straightforward. Mouthfeel is full without pushing over into sticky; mouth-filling carbonation is not too sharp; a bit more warmth on the back of the throat than one might expect at 6.9%. In the end I like this a lot, but Im not sure it has much on the better Washington ciders and it suffers all the more for its price point. A good reference but not a regular drinker. 

tl;dr summary: Complex BA cider bests its French competition.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

2444,"2012-06-09",3.4,"Poured from a refrigerated bottle into a belgian style glass. Pours a pale gold with a nice crisp white foam, which is more bubbly than anything, that quickly dissipates. The highlight of this cider for me was how well the carbonation kept several little streams of bubbles floating from the bottom of the glass to the top. It was like how when youre fishing and you sometimes see bubbles floating to the top of the water from a fish breathing. Enough on that, though. The smell was a floral bouquet of white wine alcohol presence, some light apple influences, and oak. I cant really pick up much on the calvados, unfortunately. Oak is the predominant characteristic on the tongue leaving a woody taste throughout the cider. This isnt really like any other cider Ive had, and I wouldnt necessarily recommend it to anybody, but I am happy I had the chance to try it.

2444,"2012-03-08",4.0,"0.75l corked bottle. A fantastic looking bottle this and already before popping the cork, Im almost in love with this cider just based on the looks of the bottle... Anyhow, the pour is making this fantastic fizzing sound. Really great sound - almost so great that the sound alone enough reason to buy a new bottle, but the white cider-head quickly fades into a thin and small islandy head. At first the aroma is quite sharp; a nice clear woody and farmy tone with a mix of yellow and green apples and lots of green apple zest! Also some mild tones of both sweetness and alcohol. Really nice. Its as expected lively big-bubbly carbonated and it feels surprisingly medium-bodied. Lots of both acidic and sweet apples with tones of fresh farm. The flavors changes come what character when you get more than half way down the bottle. It gets more both acidic, sweet and concentrated. It ends with a small subtle alcohol tone and almost herbal finish. Beautiful cider. 20.02.2012","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Keep your eyes away from this bottle, that cork hit my ceiling with a rare violence
In short: A pleasant cider with an old wood barrel and farmhouse character.  Nice.
How: Bottle 750ml, corked & caged.  Apples harvested in 2008, bottled in 2009  6.9% abv.  Consumed when between 1 and 2 year of age
The look:  Cloudy yellow blonde body topped by a tiny white ring of foam
In long: The abv was 6.9% and not 5.5% as currently listed on ratebeer, and I dont understand why there is currently a separate entry for the 2006 vintage because it is 7.5%, both entries should probably be merged.  NOW ON TO THE CIDER: The nose on this thing is honestly one of the most crazy thing I have ever smelled.  This is like walking in an old dank cellar with a lot of old moist barrels.  Fantastic nose really.  Taste is a bit of a letdown compared to the complexity of the nose.  concentrate apple juice, honeyed bread, brandy, tart green apples, a LOT of wood barrels, barnyard notes, some mead, moderately sweet, lots of small tickling bubbles and something a little cheesy in the yeastiness.  A little alcohol bite despite the low abv.  I liked this cider, but to be honest I am not very familiar with farmhouse ciders so I may be easily impressionable.  Everybody is ignorant, just on different subjects.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Sweet with an obvious calvados syrupy note. Slightly chewy with some stewed apple, dries out very nicely with some acidity too, but less than suggested in the nose. Some spices - cinnamon, vanilla - and alcohol at the end. Wood creeps in after a while. Seemed overcarbonated and too sweet at first, but pineapple and wood grew to check the sweetness although the lemon disappears completely. Good, complex cider that doesnt quite live up to its aroma.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

Super refreshing - pithy sourness with enough sweetness to balance.  Musty and spicy qualities in the finish.  Really smooth and its amazing how much clean apple flavor there is in the finish.

A very fine edge of bubbly foam defines itself atop the flute.  Light cascades of carbonation bubbles stream their way to the surface as if this were a fine champagne.  Barely noticeable, tiny particles of sediment float amongst the bubbles.  The aroma is of well aged apples, calavados musk, funky wood and earthy notes.  A touch of dry cinnamon and nutmeg add a spicy depth.  The flavor is dry and crisp, as it should be, with tart green and sweet red apples showing strong.  Musty wood is a nice, complimentary flavor.  The calvados is up front, obvious, and pleasing.  Semi-dry and medium bodied, this cider sports a moderately lively mouthfeel.  This is a very pleasing concoction.

The aroma became yeasty as the taste did and the appearance clouded.  Great mouthfeel from the dryness & astringency.

The calvados hints pop through on the finish, giving this cider a distinctively aperitif like finish.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"

Yellow hazy body with a rocky white head and only patchy, fast lacing.  Beautiful bretty, perfumey funk aroma.  A pleasure just to sit and take in through the nose.  Somewhat plain, gentle pear and apple cidery sweetness with some faint, dusty funk and foggy, soft cheese-like flavors.  Great green olive finish with all the fixins of haunting olive skins, oil, and stemmy goodness, a really good dryness.  Extremely long-lasting finish with the olives, terrifically interesting for what it is.  I just wish the cider flavors before the finish were more compelling to take this to another level.  Really excellent, nonetheless.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

This was my first cider and I truly didnt know what to expect... well...ummm WOW! This cider poured a light yellow golden color with a small dissipating head. Aroma is total funky barnyardiness..predominantly apple, funky cheeses, yeastiness, lemon, wonderful sourness...one of the  most perfect aromas I could have hoped for. The flavor is all green apples with tingling carbonation glancing over the tongue with a hint of pears and breadiness. Wonderful long-lasting mouthfeel, medium bodied, tart and crisp finish...wonderfully crisp! The tart crispiness couldnt have been better...this was a masterpiece and a marvel of an aroma.

2444,"2005-01-05",3.2,"Pours a hazy apple cider golden color, it is completely flat, so does not have a head of any sort.  The aroma is dominated by strongly of fresh cut, sweet apples, almost even a concentrated apple note (perhaps from the Calvados).  The taste is quite sweet, and tastes of unfermented apple juice, plus hints of oak in the finish.  There is only a hint of wild fermentation funk here, and I am quite disappointed.  I was expecting something much more wild and complex.  As it warms up it gains a hint of funkiness, and a bit of tartness in the finish.  If you like the New Glarus Fruit beers, then this is right up your alley, I prefer a bit more dryness and a bit more complexity.  This is tasty enough, it is just that the sweetness drowns out the other flavors.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Nice, full sweet apple flavor with a vinous character, rounded out by woody flavors imparted by cask aging.  Woody finish that dries up the remnant apple sugars.  Its strange how apple beers can approach this flavor so closely.  Very tasty and addictive...but at $10.99/bottle, this wont be a common sip.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

Mildly hazy blonde color with lots of chunks floating.  Had a very fizzy and very quickly dissipating white head.  Start is mildly sweet, turning quite carbonated and tart in the middle.

Strong apple flavor with more wood and vanilla and more wood and so much apple and honey and wood; crisp, bright.  So much wood it almost gets intrusive, but such a strong apple presence and some brandy notes on finish mellow and help balance the stuff.  Lingering sweet wood and more brandy.  Excellent.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

Barnyard and oaken apples aromas. I do catch a bit of key lime as well in the nose. Actually fairly thick and slightly oily on the palate, which surprises me with all the bubbles cascading upward. Lots  of apple flavors as expected with light sweetness carried away by apple skin dryness and a lightly acidic finish.

The aroma is of apples, wood, clover, and perhaps some wilderness happiness.  Aroma is a real winner with this one.  The flavor is sweet, apples, a touch sour, perhaps some cask notes, a bit of wild yeast, and quite nice.  It is almost like a mixture between a Lambic and some very nice Cider.  The body is still and almost astringent as it cleans the palate.  It is amazing how something could be so sweet, yet so dry at the same time.  Overall, sublime.

HUGE aroma of sweet fruit.  Reading other ratings, I see lots of comments about the watermellon aroma.  That sounds right, if watermellon could be a little tart or sour.  Absolutly delicious with plenty of upfront sweetness and a bit of geuze sourness on the finish.  Very dry finish.  So I guess it starts off like watermellon and finishes like a pear.  Best cider I have ever had.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","shadey"
2444,"2004-11-23",3.9,"Vintage 2003.  When I caught the first whiff, I immediately reacted that it was ""watermelon and urine"", and later I got the dimensions that approached a more lambic-like quality, which is not uncommon in the realm of fine ciders.  It is this that puts it in a class much more like English cask ciders than American mass-produced bullshit ciders.  Small floaties, hazy yellow with a light foam.  The flavors have a big apple note (obviously) with a lot of complexity and a big sweetness carrying through the finish.  I found myself a bit critical of that sweetness because it takes away the zing of a good dry cider.  It was a bit disappointing at that level, especially after enjoying the aroma so much.

Pour is a non-event, with a typical looking cider as the result.  Then comes the aroma...leather and band-aid predominate.  Apples dont appear when poured cold...once warmed the apple is mild in the aroma, and moderate in the flavor.  Still, the flavor is largely that of a medium-bodied red wine.  The palate is the most compelling element, as there is a real evolution that goes from dry and crisp, to round and sweet as it sits on your tongue.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","skaughty"

Very estery, absolutely hidden alcohol. Complex and impressive and just very different from any other cider Ive had obviously. On the tongue, the peach and pear flavors still accompany the apples, but theres a big wood-barrel counterpart which is perhaps a bit overwhelming. I absolutely love the christmas tree feeling it gave me (christmas flavors from the light barnyardy touch and) In this regard, I cant wait to try the regular Dupont cider. Weird mouthfeel evolution. At first, its rather thick, sticky, extremely sweet, sugar cane like, but it somehow gets a bit astringent toward the end.

I get apples (tart and sweet), vinegar, horseblanket, fried eggs, cask wood among other things. Hazy straw-peach color with practically no head save for a little fizziness.   Moderately sweet, lightly acidic flavor becomes a moderately sweet, lightly acidic finish.  Most of the aroma notes come through into the flavor, but the apples are dominant.  The funk is really secondary to the apples which is probably for the best.  Medium body, velvety texture, lively (but non intrusive) carbonation, drying finish.
