Its heavy in chocolate and coffee, along with milder amounts of vanilla, licorice, and a slight caramel. The taste is sweet and bitter, and its fairly heavy in both.

467,"2017-05-17",4.5,"Les japonais savent donc également réaliser des stouts. En intégrant directement des grains de café torréfié dans la recette, les arômes de café sont dailleurs bien présents en complément darômes de chocolat (malt choco utilisé) et de fruits (houblons aromatiques Kent Goldings et Chinook) donnant une belle complexité. Côté intensité, petite déception surtout sur le final qui verra les différents arômes sestomper.pour laisser principalement lamertume en bouche.EN verre, la robe de cette Espresso Stout est brun foncé et opaque (quasi noir). Leffervescence, peu marquée et avec de très fines bulles ne permet quà une très faible mousse beige dapparaître à la surface. Le nez est puissant, complexe et sur une belle alliance entre café, chocolat, mélasse et malt torréfié. A la dégustation, lattaque montre également une belle complexité, sur le café en principal, mais finement enrichi par un chocolat doux et des notes fruitées. Celle-ci est souple, avec cependant des arômes peu intenses qui montent alors en puissance, crescendo, avec une deuxième bouche plus présente, sur le malt avec des arômes de chocolat, caramel et de fruits rouges et surtout parfaitement complétée par une arrière bouche présentant une belle amertume et de des notes de café expresso pur de très bonnes factures. A noter le bon choix de houblons, Chinook et Kent Goldings, donnant cette fraîcheur agréable en alliance aux notes de café et ce petit côté fruité conférant de la complexité à la bière. LIBU à 36 est bien pensé, donnant du peps sans être agressif. La troisième bouche est par contre relativement linéaire avec malheureusement une intensité aromatique décroissant, avant un final moyennement long, présentant des notes de café pas assez brillantes et qui laissent la place à une amertume herbacée provenant du Chinook. Le sucre quant à lui est très bien dosé, mais je me pose la question de lalcool, qui à 7 % Abv aurait pu être légèrement poussé.

Some vanilla, cardboard, alcohol (8, because actually not picking up coffee). My goodness, the taste is super rich: thick gooey chocolate fudge up front thats really slow to fade, mildly bitter coffee finish with some alcohol (9).

Podsumowanie:

Mój pierwszy w życiu kontakt z japońskim craftem.
Od razu sięgnąłem po piwo z najwyższej półki.
Jest to w tej chwili piwo No 1 na świecie w japońskim piwowarstwie rzemieślniczym.
Smak jest głęboki, gładki, kremowy, palony z silnymi wyznacznikami w podtaci świeżej kawy espresso, gorzkiej czekolady, owoców (śliwki, wiśnie), a także karmelu i wanilli.
Mały minus dla browaru za zbyt wysokie wysycenie, przez które piwo sprawia wrażenie lekko zapychającego.

Bardzo unikatowy charakter Hitachino Nest Espresso Stout wynika z faktu, że Browar Kiuchi Brewery używał receptury Russian Imperial Stouta jako bazy do tego piwa.

Zgadzam się z tym w 100% - gdyby zwiększyć trochę ekstrakt i moc procentów piwo spokojnie mogło by być lekkim RIS-em.

467,"2015-01-26",3.8,"June 28th, 2013 - Hitachino has been fighting against the current in Japans pale lager soaked market for quite a few years now. The beer scene is changing, in Tokyo and elsewhere, but as it does so I believe Hitachino deserves regularly accolades for paving the way and holding fast when Japanese brewing legislation made it difficult to brew something with a little flavor invested in the recipe. This dark, rich looking bear guards itself from the atmosphere with a large, inch thick dome of bubbles, which release a perfume that is potent and rich with a dairy creaminess and low, shy chocolate darkness. The flavor abounds with espresso flavor, though its not at all bitter - unlike the real deal, which I still delightedly pucker through. The sparks of flavor resembling dark chocolate cacao nibs are good, too, creating an overall deep, dark beer that would be well served alongside select kinds of Japanese cuisine: anything barbecued or sauced, or any meal accompanied by a lovely Japanese snowfall.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Dark, creamy head drops slowly, leaves a thin film and some lacing, then vanishes. Nose is a very deep mix of dark chocolate, cocoa and well-roasted coffee. The roastiness recalls black bread crust. Mild acidity and maybe even some wild berries. Taste begins with a milky sweet chocolate, then a more dark bitter chocolate, whereas in the finish its got a good hoppy bitterness. Palate dry and roasty bitter with a small but prickly carbonation. Alcohol hidden. Overall a very nice, sweet and chocolaty - maybe even overly so - Stout.

Aroma af espressokaffe, lidt kælder, lidt læder og røg, men ikke specielt kraftig og karakteristisk udover kaffenoterne. Måske lidt fjern mørk chokolade. 
Smag byder til gengæld på ""rigtig"" kaffestout. Let sur, middel bitterhed og let til middel sødme. God fyldig krop og en god lidt sticky konsistens. Smagen sidder fint i mundvigene, selvom øllet afrundes lidt pludseligt. Veltilpasset kuldioxid uden at øllet føles flat.

467,"2014-02-03",3.9,"Aroma - malts are chocolate, coffee, roasty, alcohol, tobacco, and dark fruits (pruins). There is an oily note about the hops that are present.
Appearance - the color is black, the liquid opaque, the head a very small white head that quickly settles to a halo
Taste - the beer has sweetness, but is further on the roasted bitterness. The overwhelming property is bitter coffee, notably (espresso). Deep seated below the roast is some dark chocolate. 
Palate - the body is full, the textue slick and thick, the carbonation is stout appropriate; the finish bitter on the sides of the tongue and roast on the tops of the tongue.

Looks: Clear, deep cola blackish brown colour; Razor thin head and soapy beige foam which fades in 20 seconds; Very small sticky lacing and slight carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant roasted malt, with nice dark coffee, double cream, sugar, light chocolate, burnt toffee and moderate grass. Coffee nose get stronger and nicer with further sips.

Taste: Medium savory sweet dark roast malt, with a strong and very nice aftertaste of ice mocca. Wow! In between are strong espresso, burnt toffee, milk chocolate, liquorices, smoke, cream, dry biscuits, lime and pretty strong grassy hops. 

Body: Mid to light, with slick and very creamy palate.

Mouth Feel:Creamy and multi-layered, with very good roasty malt followed by good dose of café style espresso - bitter but nice - then a mix of smoke, chocolate and toffee, and rounded up with a fat slap of cool ice mocca. Excellent!

Hoppiness: good grass nose, strong lime nice grass hop taste, and just-right bitterness and memorable astringency for lasting finish.

After Taste: Quite dry; quite easy and creamy to mouth.


Comments: This one excels in many ways - consistent espresso aroma and taste, creamy mouth feel, smoky and malty to name but a few - most important for me, however, is that incredible refreshing ice mocca after taste which make me feel something really special.

467,"2013-05-19",4.2,"Appearance: Oily, dark black-brown with a thick coffee-crema coloured head. Head lasts for a good amount of time, and leaves sticky lacing down the glass. 

Aroma: A shot of coffee straight up, followed by some dark chocolate, vanilla, and burnt caramel.

Taste: The first thing that I could taste was a strong, almost creamy, bitterness that quickly dissipated into smooth burnt-caramel / brown-sugar and roasted malt. A very deep and complex palate, but without any of the usual lingering bitterness that espresso stouts often have. This is potentially the best espresso stout that I have tasted yet!

Mouthfeel: Creamy and balanced, with carbonation that matches the style well. Possibly slightly thinner than an Imperial Stout should be, but only if you are thinking about it.

Overall: This is probably the best espresso stout that I have tasted. Where most others leave a lingering sharpness or bitterness on the tongue, this one is very smooth and only traces of espresso remain after swallowing. Creamy and rich, like a good espresso should be, it is quite morish and is one that I will definitely repurchase and introduce to others.","AUSTRALIA","Machalel"

467,"2013-02-25",3.6,"Ive had plenty of coffee stouts, but I cant recall ever having one claiming to be an espresso stout per se. I usually like coffee stouts, so Hitachino Nest Espresso Stout sounded really intriguing. Unfortunately it didnt deliver much in the way of any coffee character and instead drank like a decent Russian Imperial Stout (which is the base style). 

I poured an 11.2oz bottle into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Dark opaque black body, no carbonation or sediment visible. Forms a large, dark tan, foamy/soapy head which retains and laces well.

Smell: Reminiscent of a ""foreign extra stout"" with notes of black licorice and some dairy. Slight roasty notes but nothing overtly coffee-smelling. Mild overall.

Taste: To be fair, I should disclaim this review by mentioning I was probably drinking an old bottle. Though I havent been able to find a credible source on how to decipher the date on it. An old bottle would probably account for the lack of coffee presence in this beer. Much like the nose theres an FES character to this beer. Black licorice, some currants or dark berries and maybe even a hint of sour grape are quite prominent through the first half. Theres a dry bitterness at the apex which has the bitterness of black coffee, but not the taste. Theres also a distinct tang or metallic off-flavor on the finish and in the aftertaste. Its a noticeable, but tolerable flaw. In the end what youre left with is a pretty standard and enjoyable FES-style brew and thats satisfactory.

Drinkability: Since Hitachino Nest Espresso Stout isnt all that intense of a beer its quite easy to drink. The mouthfeel is a little thin, on the calmer, more tepid end, and it goes down quite smooth. There is a dry bitter aftertaste, though, which might be attributed to the use of espresso beans in the boil. The 7.5% ABV is not noticeable at all as it drinks like something much smaller.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

The aroma is of espresso beans and dark chocolate. There is a distinct burnt smell. The coffee notes smell like a fresh espresso.

The taste is of strong and old coffee. The freshness you would hope for in the espresso flavor is lacking. Something is off about it (a bit of research has shown me this is probably because they add espresso beans directly to the boil). There is a nice taste of dark chocolate and roasted malts. There are not hints of hops in the beer.

The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety with gentle carbonation. The mouthfeel was one of the more impressive parts of this beer.

When I saw this one on tap locally, I had to go get me some. It didnt disappoint, with a foamy tan head adorning a dark body. Tons of coffee on the nose. It has some coffee ground characteristics, but it integrates so well into the roasty malt that it doesnt detract too much. The taste is--wow. Big, full roast flavors with lots of coffee that has just enough bitterness. Some sweet milkiness, chocolate, and Irish Cream are playing around in there, too. Smooth and velvety, with enough body to make it interesting. This is world-class, and I now expect nothing less from Hitachino.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

This beer has a very smooth and velvety body, which is actually the first thing I notice.  Starts a bit sweet, but not too sweet with significant espresso and coffee flavors coming through.

467,"2009-11-22",3.9,"Beautiful black pour, brown head, small but attractive. Aroma holds coffee, cream, sweet chocolate, caramel, roasted malt- really solid aroma. Flavor is also excellent; lots of coffee and roasted malt, along with caramel and cream and chocolate. Flavor notes are similar to the aroma, but hit in a different order; coffee is robust at the front and the bitter roast complements it well, then the sweet aspects come through closer to the finish. Palate is very full for a regular stout, and glides across the tongue beautifully. Really nice brew, particularly for a Japanese brewerys efforts on such a good style.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

467,"2009-11-11",4.6,"THOUGHTS: Almost mocha like. Incredible beer. I will buy this again if I can find it. Not super complex, but the flavors and aromas are perfect. Almost like a coffee drink instead of a beer. The best Asian beer I think Ive had so far and one of the best stouts overall. I recommend it highly.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark brown that was nearly black in the glass with slight red highlights and a small tan head that mostly diminished, but left good lacing. The aroma was heavy coffee and slightly less dark chocolate. The initial flavor was sweet and slightly sour; while the finish was sweet, a little sour and fairly bitter with a fairly duration, but consisting almost only of coffee bean. There was coffee, chocolate, fresh ground coffee, coffee beans, hints of vanilla, slight dark fruit, but mostly coffee bean, and roasted malt. There was also some bitter and sort of sour coffee. The overall flavor was more coffee bean than the actual coffee. The medium to full body was a little oily, yet creamy with very fizzy and tingly carbonation and a slightly chalky and lightly alcoholic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

Beer had oxidation and tons of flavors of metallic ice cubes and bread yeast.

467,"2009-09-14",2.9,"12oz bottle. Pours a black body with a two-finger width, dark brown, foamy and rocky head that fizzed out of the bottle upon opening and left a foamy lacing. Aroma is sour dark fruits, a light woody chocolate, and barely a hint of roasty coffee. Flavor is a little better with a distinguished roasty coffee. Starts with a sour cherry, dark fruit, light maltiness with some milky chocolate and acidity. Roasty coffees throughout with a blackberry acidity. Finishes with a chocolate, acidic berry roast-coffee with a bit of a burnt taste. Dry with an acidic roast, berry chocolate coffee aftertaste. Light to medium bodied with a higher level of carbonation. Overall, Ive come to expect the acidic taste in most of the Japanese beers I try. This is no different. A nicer, fuller flavor with plenty of roasty coffee, but Im still not digging the berry acidity taste that these beers keep offering. I like my American stouts.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Head is average size, frothy/fizzy, light brown with fair lacing and is almost fully diminishing. color is very dark brown. Flavor starts lightly sweet and moderately acidic, then the long finish is moderately acidic, heavily bitter and a little sour. Palate is medium to full, oily, with a soft carbonation and finishes chalky, lighty astringent and very dry, like chewing on fine coffee grounds.

467,"2009-09-01",3.7,"Pours black as night with a 3 finger, very creamy, burnt sienna head that has great retention, but becomes alot chunkier over time and leaves some nice lacing. Aroma is roast, milk chocolate, lots of espresso, vanilla, hot cocoa, tree bark and some ethanol. Flavor is roast, stale coffee, more tree bark like tartness, cocoa powder, light caramel, vanilla, havarti cheese, light dark fruit notes. Finishes with roast, char, espresso, pretty strong bitter hops and cocoa powder fade. Palate is creamy and a little slick all the way up the the finish where it dries out quite a bit really suddenly, which I dont find to be the most pleasant. Overall I think this brew could cut back on the bitter hops and chocolate a bit and get rid of the odd, tart flavors, they dont really work well with this stuff, however weak they are. That being said, I still really enjoyed this stout, I really think it would be absolutely phenomenal if the above changes were made though.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

Pours a near black opaque pour with moderate darker brown head that laces ok, dies to a decent layer eventually. Aromas are interesting, a touch sour with coffee and chocolate, lactose, with some lighter roasty character but a strange almost sourness comes out on the nose. Almost, cheesy? Initial is creamy, a bit of vanilla and lactose stand behind espresso, coffee grounds, and dark chocolate that bitter well. Roasty, but still smooth. A strange lactose feel comes in, a bit sour almost but moving to almost a custard creamy vanilla that tempers and balances the roasted malts.

<b>In long: </b>Nose is roasted with some coffee beans.  Body is pleasantly full, creamy yet roasted.  For an Espresso stout the taste is not really dominated by coffee.  A ton of dark malts, chocolate and cacao, espresso, roasted coffee beans, a light astringency (lemony hops?) in the finish increases drinkability.

Nose reminds of Founders, vegetal bean deluxe, some tobacco and smoke, and yet theres also this odd raisin/burnt sugar scent. Flavor carries more tobacco and coffee, and probably vanilla. As it warms, vanilla and chocolate are well-incorporated, so its never singular and over-bitter. Moderate sized body, rather creamy. It doesnt go as far overboard with the coffee and thus allows room for other stuff, and so I think I prefer it to Mikkellers and Founders.

467,"2008-10-20",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 1, 2013 11.2oz from Sams, Durham. Very appealing aroma, initially strong roasts that (to me) specifically recalled Bells Java. But theres a softness to this brew, almost a lactic, sweet stout quality that makes this one sort of a hybrid. Sweet stout and chocolate malts, with intensely bitter espresso, dry but not too burnt, which is quite nice and lets the finest qualities of the bean itself come through. Substantial body, smooth mouthfeel. A good one.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
467,"2008-10-19",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
This Stout’s lush mouthfeel expresses roasted caramel maltiness and lenient coffee in a chewy and lightly bitter vehicle.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-Thick foam covers the pitch darkness.
-This bottle feels a tad old, which may have affected the coffee aroma somewhat.
-The roasted caramel takes on pumpernickel and molasses allusions as well.
-Its rich body is one of its best features.
-Some roasted malt bitterness finishes each sip.

The body is nice and chewy.  I actually sliced a piece off for my wife to try.  The taste is....oh never, mind, it’s espresso too.

Chocolate, creamy lactic milk taste, brown sugar. A touch of refreshing sourness, and a touch of vanilla. Maybe a touch of aroma hops as well? Perfectly balanced. Great bitterness, decent sweetness.

Accomplished coffee stout.

I like:
Aromatic, ashey and solidly roasted ale whose alcohol remains hidden. Medium-full bodied, though rather highly carbonated èa la Belgian stout. A malt extraction feature where sweetness is constantly kept at bay by the competent roastiness.

467,"2008-08-15",3.6,"I am happy to say that something decent in the brewing world has finally come out of Japan. The beer poured wonderfully. Little bit of a chocolate head action going on. The beer seem to be pretty thick on its way in the glass, and the beer is also very dark. I think this is a good looking beer. The head could be a bit darker, but still nice. Big chocolate nose on this sucker. Also, there is a nice subtle espresso (I guess)/coffee aroma. Very nice smelling beer. There is a slight roast aroma, but the chocolate and coffee are more pronounced. The beer has a weird flavor. It has the coffee and the chocolate, and even a little roast in the flavor, but these flavors are seemingly mild, but also they are not. Little too carbonated if you ask me. This over-carbonation steals away from the flavor. If the mouthfeel weren’t so bubbly then I would probably be able to taste the flavors a bit more.

Considering this probably came from Japan on a slow boat the espresso/coffee aroma is amazingly fresh and concentrated. I get some earthy soil and old tree bark notes, but they actually compliment the aroma rather than detract. Soot and charcoal also show up and again it smells very right in this beer. The body is full on black and holds a two finger thick mocha head that is quite lasting. The first sip is ash, dark fruit and chocolate. The coffee notes are much less pronounced in the flavor, though clearly still present. The middle gets almost chocolate covered cherry-like.

A bit of plummy sweetness, soft cocoa and a rich roastiness.  Flavour is quite sweet but this is balanced by roast behind all of the espresso.  Sweet and lightly plummy.

Black in color with eternal dark tan head.  Head is so long lasting and thick - it almost appears ""chunky"".  Slight roasted burning malt smell and a very very light coffee smell.

467,"2008-02-16",3.5,"Pours with a frothy, initially two-finger thick, chocolate cream colored head.  The beer is quite black and opaque in color.  The aroma has huge, dark roast, espresso aromatics to it.  Noticed aromas of burnt berry notes, charcoal, dark chocolate, burnt toast and a middle that is made up of sweet, malty chocolate candy like notes.  At times the aroma can be quite rich and satisfying, but at others the roast character is a bit overwhelming and tends to make this seem a bit thin, sharp and burnt.

Very thick bodied and sweet, this is much more of a meal than I was expecting.  Through the middle the thick, sweet, malt flavors do a good job of balancing the roast & espresso notes.  The burnt malt and espresso malt notes are found in the long finish were they slightly dry out the up front sweetness, but there is also a distinct, lingering note that tastes like burnt blueberries.  The sweet notes accent a rich chocolate middle, sweet coffee cream flavors and a blackened toffee flavor.  The body of this thing really is quite creamy, rich, thick and viscous; I cant remember a beer of this strength that is as thick as this brew.

An interesting beer, while the flavor was quite sweet, it was much more in balance than the aroma was.  The huge, dark malt sweetness was needed to balance out the aggressive roast grain and espresso notes.  The aroma is a bit too dominated by the roast aromatics.  Actually based on the aroma I was expecting the flavor to be overly burnt and acidic, quite happily this is not.  The most interesting thing about this beer is that lingering, fruit flavor in the far finish that is a mix of blueberries and tropical fruit.  More than likely this last is from the espresso beans.

There are some notes of bittersweet chocolate as well.  The flavor is dense with coffee, roasted malts, and bitter chocolate (almost ike unsweetened Bakers Chocolate).  It is also dry and earthy with some old, used coffee ground type flavor coming through just before the bitter, dark chocolate finish.

This is without a doubt the most intensely coffeed-out brew I have ever some across.  Any other scents or aromas that might be present are crushed by the massive avalanche of sharp, biting espresso.  A heaping helping of sweet, malty sugar has been added to make this concoction drinkable, which causes it to sit very heavy on the stomach.  Still, its bitter as hell, despite the sweeteners.  Finishes roasty, with a slight sour tickle in the back of the throat.  Just a hair shy of full bodied.

Medium to thick mouthfeel pretty full bodied, kinda gritty feeling, but I might have been imagining that.  I really thought I would like this more, as it sounds so good.  However, its merely okay.

467,"2007-11-20",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2010 Bottle. Pours rather dark with a small tan head. This certainly smells like a cup of joe.  Roasty coffee predominantly in the nose with a backdrop of malts. Mouthfeel seems a little thinner than Id like, but its not problematic. The coffee flavor here is certainly strong, but I get residual, milky sweetness as well. No other roast seems to be imparted on my palate other than the distinct coffee flavor, which really doesnt remind me much of espresso. Id say Expedition stout tastes more like espresso than this does. This beer has more of a lighter roasted coffee bean feel to it, with more sharp acidity and less smoke and less caramelized qualities.  Im a little biased on beers like this since I enjoy a good cup of java so much. This is not subtle in its use of coffee, but it works pretty darn well. I could stand a stronger, smokier, ashier feel, but this is pretty good.

Bottle from some liquor store in Gatlinburg. I wanted to try this one again as I remember liking it quite well but noticing my original rating did not reflect that. The verdict: I bumped up my rating significantly and was nitpicking way too much in my original tasting of this beer. I mustve been in a foul mood or something because this is a solid stout through and through. Plenty of coffee is in the aroma and the flavor in a clean and solid transposition. Still, mocha and barley come through to round things out well. This is one of the better renditions of a coffee stout, something I really enjoy anyway. Im still baffled as to why their lacto stout is so bad, given the quality of the espresso stout.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

467,"2007-11-20",3.8,"A thick, stiff foamy head is slow to build and slow to die away. Lumpy and tan. The aroma is distinctly roasty, but its not obviously a coffee beer. The coffee is balanced and blends well with the rest of the beer instead of standing out and being featured. This also avoids the ashy flavors that many coffee stouts suffer from. Dry and tasty.

Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately bitter, slightly husky. Medium body, creamy texture, lively/soft carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Big aroma of cold, stale coffee grounds and celery...highly vegetal.  Ok balance but a shade too tart for my tastes, and somewhat husky finish.  Great appearance and mouthfeel, though.

467,"2007-11-15",3.4,"Bottle.  Pours dark brown/black with dark tan head. Some mile lacing is evident.  Aroma is interestingly a mix of coffee, oak wood, and vanilla.  Very intriguing.  First sip.  Wow, chcolate and coffee hit with gusto.  The wood kicks in almost as fast and lasts throughout, almost too much, killing the coffee and chocolate flavors.  Continuing to drink, the wood flavors subside to blend in nicely with the rest of the flavors and balance out.  Feeling is medium.  The ending is acidic but the chocolate and coffee are very enjoyable as an aftertaste. Overall a very good brew, if it wasnt for the first shock feeling like i just put a piece of oak in my mouth to suck on, it would be even better.","Watertown, Wisconsin, USA","ubamartian"
467,"2007-11-15",3.6,"Bottle. Pours amber black with pretty tall beige head. The aroma is full of obvious coffee, but it combines with an interesting bourbon-like woody vanilla tone and some chocolate to make it quite pleasant smelling. The flavor isnt as obnoxious about the coffee tones, though it is still quite distinct. Chocolate and wood notes keep it together quite well. It gets pretty acidic toward the finish, but in a refreshing way, with some oak and berry notes. I must say, I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Yum.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"
467,"2007-11-13",4.2,"Bottle into mug, purchased at Frugal MacDougals,  Nashville.  Nice looking stout, with a sizeable medium brown and creamy head over opaque ruby black beer.  Rich dry coffee ground aroma punctuated by burnt wood qualities.  Wow, the coffee in the flavor hits right away, right when it hits the tip of the tongue, before the flare-up of carbonation even has a chance to foam in the mouth.  This is true to its name: it even as the acidic roast aftertaste of Lavazza on the sides.  Besides the espresso, this has a light caramelly sweetness and malt character that rides the foamy carbonation and leaves just a little bit of sweetness for the finish.  Wonderful.  I dont know how a beer of this ilk could taste better.  Its not as complex as the recent spate of ""breakfast"" stouts, but as a straightforward coffee stout, this is top-tier; this is maybe the highest score I could see myself giving for a beer of this type.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Flavor is very similar, would have liked a bit more chocolate though in this part of the beer. Espresso is very powerful, wonderfully done. Creamy palate, medium bodied.

The usual strong coffee tones of parsley, green pepper (jalapenos) and gravel are all present. The flavour has a bit more complex malt composition with clearer chocolate notes but the coffee is still dominant. Some milk in the middle and the finish holds some dark fruit notes of raisins and figs. Hints of gravel. Light to medium bitter with a dry ending and some sour notes. Medium bodied.

Flavor is strong espresso coffee with hints of milk chocolate.  Burnt malts also take over late in the drink. Leaves a bitter, nutty aftertaste that really didnt jive with me.

Quite acidic from the coffee and dark malts. Roasted malts, burnt almonds and dark chocolate covered espresso beans all in the flavors. The high acidity effects both the feel and the flavor and knocks them each down a touch. Finish returns to some sweeter malt and some fig flavors. Linger is dry and has just a touch of charcoal.

Theres a great interplay between the salty, bright roast of the malt and the acidic, fruity sweetness of the coffees higher essences. Resplendent. Theres some dust off of the grounds, and a bit of the syrupy sticky resin that comes from a pot of Turkish coffee, heavily seasoned with Turbinado. In the middle salty sea grasses and drying oak. Man, this is good. Finishes on a light crisp note of mint chocolate and leaf. Bright, friendly and percolating. Body is near perfection for the style. Not overly heavy, instead carrying the flavors on just the right amount of sugar and totally undetectable alcohol. If you love coffee, youll love this beer.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
467,"2007-09-14",3.7,"From the bottle this poured an inky brown/black that was topped by a heavy lacing, thick & creamy light brown head.  The aroma is chocolatey espresso with a quiet pine hopping.  Creamy mouthfeel.  It tasted of espresso, chopped nuts, chocolate, [pine, and a drop of alcohol.  Nice blending of flavors.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp?

Flavor is similar, but with an acrid smokiness.  A little too astringent.  This is a good beer, but I have no idea why its a 3.9.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","nhorween"

Appears a near black, dark brown with a clumpy, light tan head that fades into a mild film and cap. Spotty lacing is left around the glass.
Smell is of coffee grounds, caramel, nuts, vanilla, cocoa, mocha, and roasted malt.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a bitter, roasted wood-like flavor coming through.
Mouthfeel is slightly tart, nutty, and dry.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"
467,"2007-09-03",3.7,"Bottle from SL, highly anticipated based on slobs reviewing this before me as it sat in my fridge for quite a while. Pour was deep black, slow developing tan-chocolate head, but it thinned to a circlular ring quickly although retained itself as such quite well (interesting). Lacing was weak. The aroma was rich dry coffee, a touch of chocolate, really quite simple. The flavor started out a bit bitter, disappointingly so, bitter rough coffee. However, temperature was absolutely critical on this one, with warming immense improvements, bitterness less prominent yet not subtle, quality of the coffee flavors started to work, chocolate playing a nice subtle supporting role. Definitely doesnt approach a sweet coffee stout, yet the dry bitterness (turned more gentle with warmer temps) does seem to work well. I tend to like the Breakfast Stout on up in terms of sweetness, so this is a notch below (or more in appearance), yet pretty nice, nonetheless. Mouthfeel is much lighter than those two, silky, slightly acidic, quite drinkable for 7.5% ABV.","","User37895"

467,"2007-09-01",4.4,"Black body with an orange head. The aroma is very strong coffee with some nice fresh cut grass. There is also a little bit of caramel. The taste has some rich notes of espresso with some cream. There is also some hints of lactose, but maybe that is my imagination. A rich, creamy body. Hitachino nails another winner. I would buy more of their beers if they were a little cheaper.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

467,"2007-08-24",4.3,"11.2 oz bottle from Greens on Ponce.  I was more than pleasantly surprised by this one.  A tremendous coffee aroma, tar-black color, and, of course, a BIG coffee/expresso flavor.  Alcohol is very well hidden and palate is incredibly smooth for a big stout like this.  Man, I could have one of these at breakfast every morning!  Its that good.  Highly recommend it.","Vinton, Virginia, USA","Delsym"
467,"2007-08-23",4.4,"Bottle from State Line.  Big, big espresso nose.  High praise coming: one of the top two or three coffee stout noses Ive sampled, and probably the closest to actual espresso before taking on a more chocolatey tone.  Opaque pitch pour with a dark brown head, soapy and foamy and excited.  Initial taste is pure espresso - less bitter than the actual stuff, but the ring of it is the same.  Roast, chocolate, and even the dregs at the bottom of the tiny cup, with lesser contributing notes of vanilla and faint bourbon.  Bittersweet and burned, big league taste in session form (7.5% excluded).  Alcohol is very well integrated and non-intrusive.  Velveteen feel and a medium, still thickish body.  Aftertaste is dry and slightly woody.  Clean and really yummy!  Ive liked this brewery for some time, and this is another treasure.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
467,"2007-08-22",3.8,"11.2oz bottle, no date from Johns Grocery.  Almost black with a 1/2 finger tan head, fades to a ring before long.  Lots of coffee (plus the acidity that comes with it), roasted malts and chocolate (both milk and dark).  A touch of salty soy sauce was in there as well. The flavor was quite roasty with a fair amount of acidity again, some dark and sweet milk chocolate and anise following through to a bitter chocolatey dry finish.  Alcohol was present, but never to the point of Medium creamy body with moderate carbonation.  This wasnt ungodly complex, but what was there is very good.

467,"2007-08-18",4.1,"Pours black with a tan head that lasted.  Aroma was definitely heavy on coffee, with some hints of dark chocolate and toasted walnut coming through as well.  Flavor was an inital blast of both dark chocolate and dark roasted coffee, with a subtle hint of vanilla, which then yielded to a long lasting roasted coffee finish, a very good beer.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
467,"2007-08-17",3.7,"Black pour, slightly opaque around the edges with a nice sized, creamy light brown head.  Roasted coffee aroma.  Thick, full bodied and creamy mouthfeel.  Definitely a strong coffee stout.  Primarily roasted coffee, espresso, nuttiness and woodsy/oak undertones.  Long, bitter finish.  Alcohol well hidden.  Pretty good, but I think a bit overrated.

467,"2007-08-15",3.9,"New arrival at Johns Grocery in Iowa City. 330 ml bottle served at cellar temperature. Poured an opaque black color. Head was thick and cocoa colored with good retention and lacing. I didnt detect more than subdued coffee in the aroma. Smelled more like milk chocolate to me. There was also an occasional whiff of green chili pepper. Perhaps my olfactory lobe is still overwhelmed with glee from the Ølfabrikken porter I tried a few minutes ago. Sweet and chocolatey with coffee coming out more in the flavor. There was moderate roasty bitterness throughout which strengthened toward the end and lingered with a distinct coffee aftertaste. Good beer.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"

As far as the taste goes, there is no surprise, it is mainly just very potent coffee.  There is also a little chocolate and very little bitterness.  Good mouthfeel, just the right amount of cabonation.  At the end, the flavor of coffee (again is strongest), chocolate and maybe a little vanilla lingers forever.

Froth reduces to a thick, sticky, creamy lace. The aroma alone is worth buying this brew. Heavy, heavy, heavy espreso. Its so heavily roasted it smells like chipotle peppers hot off the grill. I really have to say WOW! at this point. LOL. Full nectar w/ creamy residual effers. Awsome! Im amazd at this flavor profile. This brew excedes my expectations. Its not sweet at all. HUGE roasted espresso flavors dominate like the tripods in War of the Worlds. Big balancing malts provide the life sustaining backbone to push this brew into overdrive and through the stratosphere. The finish is long and lasts forever w/ perfect bittering. Overall: no words can describe the emotional experience this brew evokes.

467,"2007-08-10",3.7,"Appearance: Pours a pitch black body with a full, rich tan-colored head. Alright, this looks pretty solid. 

Smell: A very aromatic, expressive nose of heavily roasted coffee beans. While there is a bit of roasted malts and dark, dark chocolate, its mostly all cold coffee.

Taste: Powerful coffee taste through and through. Only a teensy bit of malty sweetness manages to get past it as does a very faint spiciness. The finish is packed with roasty bitterness and lingers incessantly.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Smooth, nearly oily mouthfeel. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: Good for you, Hitachino. Espresso Stout is a beer that deserves polite, though not particularly raucous applause. Lets keep our heads, folks.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

467,"2007-08-04",4.1,"Rating #100.  Wanted to do something big for the milestone, but instead of raiding my Trappist reserves, I decided to go with a beer that had few ratings, and belonged to a style that I enjoyed.  Pours a pitch black hue with a very small tan head.  Giant aroma, highlighted by roasted coffee beans and a sweet malt that reminded me a bit of the Lacto Stout.  Bittersweet chocolate and dark, roasted coffee dominate the palate as the beer is consumed.  Not too thick, easily enjoyable.  A great beer, but just lacks enough complexity to give Founders Breakfast/Ky. Breakfast Stouts a run.  Avoid, so I can buy more!","Mechanicsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","f351c4v"
