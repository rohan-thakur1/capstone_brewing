740,"2016-09-17",4.1,"12 oz. looks like it may have been bottled 07 25 16. Reddish-copper with a thin film of foam. Nose of spicy whole grain bread, toffee and a jot of fish sauce. Tastes of earthy toast, citrus zest, resin and toffee. Medium-plus body has smooth low-medium carbonation and a big healthy dose of rye and hop to counter the rich malt. Very nice.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
740,"2015-10-15",3.7,"12 oz bottle of an unfiltered IPA (not a red ale) ""aggressively hopped with ... Citra & Amarillo hops"". ""90 IBU""

Im not sure how the formulation differs from their Hi-Pitch India Pale Ale, which I had just yesterday, but this is clearly different. The Lion Tamer (""Red"" not part of the current labeling) is a bit more bitter, has a darker and redder body, and is markedly more hoppy, especially in the nose. Altogether, it is as different as one might expect from an entirely different brewer. Both, however, have a similar and very good mouthfeel, with ample but soft carbonation, a medium body, and light dryness.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

740,"2014-08-31",3.3,"Out of a bottle this pours a amber color with a light white head. Very complex flavors with rye being the leader. Tastes of toasted grains, bread and straw. Very bitter finish that leaves you really wanting another sip!","North Carolina, USA","Lutz2jm"
740,"2014-08-30",3.8,"Half pour at Foggy Mountain Brewpub. Beautiful appearance- rich copper color with generous, thick white head. Decent legs. Nose is full of pine and citrus and caramel malts- taste follows. Finishes on the bitter side and rye is there, but could even be more pronounced for me. Somewhat slick/oily mouthfeel in a very satisfying way. Does not drink like the 7% or 90IBUs it has- really well done. One of my favorites from these guys.","","woodychevy"

740,"2013-08-05",3.6,"10 oz. pour at the brewery. This is murky brown color with a small head. The aroma is nicely hoppy and grassy with thick rye and caramel. Good hop use in the flavor as well. It stays grassy and citrusy balanced by the dry rye spiciness and sweeter suggestions of toffee. It gets pretty sticky after a few sips. Pretty good brew.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
