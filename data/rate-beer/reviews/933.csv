933,"2013-08-10",3.1,"At the brewery. Pours slight hazy copper with small off white head. Light spice in the aroma and some faint malts. Flavor is unexpected. Sour apples and sweet caramel malts meld into a light flavor and mouthfeel. Adequate carbonation. Strange sourness here. At best, interesting. At worst, meh.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"

933,"2013-08-09",3.6,"Agreed, loving the name of this brew. It had an attractive hazy brown color to it with a bone-white head. Aromas were full of fresh bread, soft hops and some grapefruit. Medium bodied and slightly hoppy, the finish was crisp like a lager with delightful hay and bread undertones. Very good beer here.","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"
