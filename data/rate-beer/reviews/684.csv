684,"2016-10-11",4.0,"Draught at Churchkey, Washington DC. Pours a deep ruby, with a small light tan head, which lasts well and leaves decent lacing. Savoury, meaty notes, light herbal and grassy hops and sweeter syrupy notes make up the aroma. Light grassy hops give way to toffee and mocha. Meaty, savoury notes lead into the finish, which is smooth and satisfying. A very pleasant beer indeed.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"
684,"2016-05-30",3.8,"Pours hazy brown with a minimal ring of head. Aroma is dark and fruity with toffee character. Very rich and sweet with prune flavored predominating. Crisp but buttery on the palate.

684,"2012-04-25",3.7,"Originally reviewed: 10/31/09. Pretty excited to see a few bottles of this hit some local stores recently. This seems to be one of the more elusive offerings from Highland. 

Poured into my pint glass. Pours a very dark tawny brown with a thick tan head on top. Retains fairly well and it leaves plenty of sticky lace in its wake. Smells of caramel, candy, and some dark fruits. 

Theres a good amount of body to this. It borders on the heavy side. Carbonation level is moderate. Flavors of toffee, plum, pumpernickel bread, and has a pleasant mild bitterness from the hops. This is very much a malt-forward beer and I like it. Recommend.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

684,"2011-06-01",3.4,"Poured into my recently purchased Highlands pint glass. 

4.5 A: Clear deep amber brown color. Two fingers of tan creamy/frothy head with very good retention and a good amount of lacing. Good here.

4.5 S: Grainy malts with ample amounts of caramel and toffee. A decent toastiness with some roastiness and hints of chocolate. Lastly, the thing that sets this apart is a pleasant herbalness. Im not sure what heather smells like, but I think this might be it.

3.5 T: Taste is good, but it really doesnt compare to the appearance or nose. Lots of toastiness with a strangely noticeable burnt flavor. Grainy and bready malts. Again a good amount of toffee and caramel, but not much sweetness overall, at least not for the style. Also a reasonably noticeable bitterness. Whether this comes mainly from the hops or the roasted malts is up for question.

3.5 M: Medium to heavier medium body. A bit lighter than I like for the style. Good moderate carbonation. Could be creamier, but good smoothness.

3.5 D: Not a bad beer, but I expected this style to be perfected by THIS brewery. Anyway, worth a drink if you stumble upon it.

684,"2011-05-08",3.8,"I opened the bottle and poured into my nonic pint. A beautiful, brilliant dark mahogany. Decently sized tan head rests up on top. It takes a bit longer to subside, but when the creamy goodness does fall, it leaves ample lacing on the glass. Almost like shaving cream. The smell on this thing is definitely malty. Almost smells like wort it is so malty. There is some roasted notes and a bit of a smokiness to it. A slightly nutty aroma as well. No hop aroma. As if I thought there would actually be one in a Scotch ale. Smells very good. The guy I traded with is right so far.

 Big nutty taste. A bit of tobacco as well. And, of course, malt. Tons of malt. Roasted malt, nutty malt, smoky malt. Its all there. There is a sweetness from all that malt that is played against the dryness very well. And a dried dark fruit, mostly raisins, taste that is very well placed. There is a slight bitterness, but Im sure that is from the roasted grains that were probably used in the making of this. Again, no hops are showing up in the flavor or aftertaste. And, again, not very surprising as that isnt what this style is all about. There is also a slight taste of spices in there. I cant really place them, and they are very subtle, if they are even there at all. My mind could be playing tricks on me. Geto Boyz!!!","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"
684,"2011-05-07",4.0,"Darker malts and higher hops make for a Scotch Ale that, as the kids at Burger King say, rules your face.  The malts are the stars of the show, roasty and full of deep caramel, yet the hops trim up the fat, preventing the brew from growing saccharine-- you end up thinking of Tasgall as a brown ale in a kilt.

Served in a tulip glass. Pours a moderate brown color with a bit of a light tan head, though not much lacing. The nose is brown sugar, some toasted malt, and not too much else. The taste is about the same and ends up being quite bland. Theres some semi-sweet malt and a bit of toffee. A bit of alcohol in the feel and a decent body. Well made, but not all that great.

Recieved this in a trade with brentk56, thanks a lot Brent! Tasgall pours the darkest of reds bordering on bordering on black when no backlit. Mahogany highlights shine when held to the light and make for a good looking beer. A one + finger ecru head grew on the pour and faded to a solid cap leaving sheet lacing down the glass. An excellent looking brew!

The nose seems to be a little on the faint side whats there is certainly good though. Faint dark chocolate and a mild hazelnut combine over the top of a brown sugar malty base. Theres a decent amount of roastiness in there which makes up the majority of the aroma. The more it warms the more peat smokiness comes forward. If the smell was a little more bold this would be excellent, the way it is its still good.

Flavor starts off with a hit of bakers chocolate and that peat smokiness. While the chocolate fades the peat wafts in and out of roasty malts, a sprinkling of brown sugar, a bit of the nuttiness, some dark fruit sweetness (prune and fig), and the faintest hint of citrus from the hopping. The chocolate makes its appearance on the backend but more in the form of dark then bakers. This here is a good beer.

The mouthfeel is a little lighter then expected but actually fits very well for this particular beer. Body is medium and moves at a decent pace keeping the flavors evolving.

Highly drinkable for such a high abv beer. The constant changing of flavor and the moderate body keep the glass tilted.

Ive become a big fan of Highlands beer. Every one Ive sampled have been very good, this is no exception. I would pick this up often if it was available in IL. Thanks for the taste Brent.

Taste: nectar of the gods, basically. Coffee, dark chocolate, and sorghum.
Palate: perfect in every way.

The aroma shows big time nougat, scorched caramel, smoked peat, and chocolate.  Moderate piney hops show on a deep inhale, but this one seems to be all about the malts.  Flavors are similar, and expertly blended.  Smoked peat dominates.  Burnt caramel, chocolate and nougat add depth and character, while resinous pine hops lend good balance.  This one is delicious.

684,"2007-10-24",4.2,"Soft mahogany brown, fairly thick, with a nice thick capping of lightly sandy browned foam about a finger high in girth. Stays lightly present on top with a milky skim and lots of sheeting lace sticks well across the glass. 

Aroma is a wee light for a wee heavy with some roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit sweetness, and some dark brown sugar. Its seemingly more like a big chocolatey porter for a nose. But whats there is pleasant, just not in porportion to what it could be for Wee. 

Taste is much, much better however, again, closing in on a porter-like character with fairly big roasted malt flavors and lots of chocolate tones. Nice additional notes tend to sneak in with some brown sugar, darker caramel sugars, fudge, coffee, and a touch of dark fruityness of raisins and figs. There is only the smideonyiest of smidgeons to peat or smoke wrapped in the chocolate late in the finish. Flavors last for great length and make for a very nice tasting experience. Keeper of a finish, wow. It lays out a thick layer of the roast and chocolate for everything else to land on. 

The body is just above medium, nearly full, with lightly chewy acpects and heavy silken fudgeyness and chocolate silk pie creamyness. The roasted chocolate notes add nice feathery touches of both roasted chocolate bitterness and dryness to equal the delicate softness as it fades into the finish where it lasts and lasts and lasts with tone and flavor.

Flavor is smoke, charred wood, espresso with cream, metallic-tinged molasses, maybe some cocoa. After half a glass, the smokiness fades and the bitter grassy finish becomes more noticeable.

684,"2007-09-01",4.1,"Wow, does this look great. A magnificently retained beige head, creamy and mid-sized, sits atop a totally nearly opaque, very thick looking deep chestnut body with crimson/mahogany underlying. The appearance is immaculate, staring into it is like looking into the mash tun while its being brewed. The nose is strinking, chocolate malt piling out first like there just isnt enough room in the glass to hold it any longer. Moderate peated malt follows, complete with mild smoke notes and light peppery spice. Also present are caramel, dry toffee, cherries, aged Dominican rum, toasted grain and oily nuts. Alcohol is almost entirely masked. Chocolate is foremost in the flavor as well, followed succinctly by caramel, nut oils and ancient peat. Sweetness is medium and masterful for this style and particularly for this recipe, which seems to pay homage to faraway origins and remains fresh and inventive. The chocolate note is marvelous, neither bitter nor too sweet, but full and rich. Bitterness is low, spiciness low to mild, acidity very low but presented in such a way that sweets are dispersed evenly across the tongue. This provides a very full bodied mouthfeel and accelerates the involvement in a velvety texture. Carbonation is low(in feeling, most must have faded into the formation of the head), the mouthfeel is very smooth and rewarding. I do think if this were any thicker it would seem too syrupy but its just great as is. The finish is sweet and caramel-infused, light smoke and peaty spice lingering for a long while. A wonderful example of the style with no flaws and a superb display of Highlands ability across the style spectrum.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Smell: Mm-mmm! A good, solid roasted malt aroma with a background of earthy hops.

Taste: An envigorating upfront roasted malt surge. Theres also a toothsome sweetness about it, and thats entirely a good thing. More hopped than other scotch ales Ive had, but the hopping is still quite light, and only helps to round out the malt flavors. The hops follow through in the warm, lingering finish.

Roasty and somewhat unclean toasty flavor, really bugs me.  Prunes raisins, diacetyl, with a really roasty toasty aftertaste.  Not just too much for this style, but unclean in any style I think.

684,"2007-04-10",3.8,"Tasgall Ale pours a deep brown color and initially has a dense and creamy dark beige head that leaves thins lacing marks after each drink.  Sweet, chewy caramel with some roasted malt undertones waft from the glass as the aroma reaches my nose.  This is followed by a rich, malty flavor prominently exhibits chocolate and caramel.  A trace of char/charcoal is also detectable from the roasted barley which is a nice little bonus.  The slightly escalated level of hops make a minor appearance in the finish as the mild bitterness they lend balances well with the roasted coffee-like and lightly charred finish.  The alcohol (8.0%) is well buried in the flavor, but it definitely sneaks up on you later on!  The carbonation level is moderate and is comprised of very small bubbles creating a smooth, easy to drink beer with a nearly full body and slight chewy and sticky characteristics.  This is a very good Scotch Ale.  The extra touch of bitterness really rounds out this beer nicely.

684,"2006-10-08",3.4,"Any first impressions?
-A veil of foam rests atop the dark red.
-Beany maltiness and earthy caramel herald sweet simplicity.
-Its creamy caramel maltiness is definitely my favorite feature, helped by meditative carbonation.
-Sweet maltiness doesnt evolve into complexity, but manages to grab the attention of the malt lover.

What if you dig deeper?
-Some roastiness is found amongst the earthy soil.
-Supporting hop bitterness tickles the back end, but can easily be forgotten.
-Sweet maltiness develops light fruitiness, as raisins or dates.
-This is a very comfortable scotch ale which lacks the wit and intricacies of Corne de Brume or Alesmith Wee Heavy (for example), but which remains an enjoyable strong brew for malt heads.

684,"2006-10-01",3.9,"22 oz bottle (thanks to acertain!) into a Snifter style glass.  Pours a deep ruby red brown color with a fairly foamy tanned head...the brew looks heavily carbonated.  The aroma is a blast of huge carmalized and roasted malts with hints of chocolate and bittered hops thrown in the mix.  A tiny bit of alcohol is hidden in the nose very well as well.  Just a tiny hint to let you know its there - but nothing overpowering.  When this one hits the toungue at first a lovely and sweet carmalized malt swoops over the palate, which slowly (with huge, dense bubbles dancing over the tongue) progresses into a roasted grain and hopped game, the two with equal balance, but both trying to take over.  In there somewhere as the sip goes into the throat is a well done chocolate taste that gives in to an also well done alcohol singe that will leave the palate with a highly complex aftertaste.  This one has a thick and chewy body throughout the whole thing.  Im really beginning to enjoy Scotch style ales more and more - especially when theyre done as well as this!

684,"2006-09-10",4.1,"Bomber courtesy of Ross, thank you! Scotch ales are amongst my least understood style of beer. Often I get confused between a ""scotch ale"" and a ""Scottish"" ale. My understanding of the style ""scotch ale"" is a malt oriented beer with strong leaning towards scotches. Since hops never did flourish in Scotland, but grains did (and still do), Scottish brewers have been aiming at pefecting heavily malted, sweet, and smokey beers using ingredients that are readily available to them. This one is brewed in North Carolina, which is thousands of miles from Scotland, but whats clear is that Highland has done their homework. This beer is the deepest amber known to man. It pours almost still, with just a modest ring of beige foam. This beer transports you to a cloudy day in Scotland almost instantly. Youre sitting on your porch.You can smell the chimney smoke of your neighbours home, the single malt scotch that perhaps your father is enjoying while sitting in his chair inside. The fresh peat and wet wood of the nearby forest, where you used to play as a child. Your mother is just finishing cooking up dinner, and while youre not sure what shes made, you can smell the burnt sugars and figs of whatever it is. You close your eyes, your mouth waters, and you think of all these aromas you are smelling. Could there be something that tastes exactly how it smells..........suddenly your not in Scotland anymore.......but youve got a bottle of Highlands Tasgall ale in front of you, and almost instantly youre not surprised.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"

684,"2006-03-06",4.0,"This beer is a deep, dark, opaque, amber-tinged brown color.  It is topped by a four-finger thick, amber-hued tan head that is mostly frothy, but a little creamy in consistency.  The aroma is rich with a mix of fruit and malt; I get notes of fig, rich toffee, hints of salty-chewy malt, concentrated raisins, condensed toasted grain, and a touch of lightly roasted coffee.  The aroma is quite enjoyable; rich and concentrated, which makes for an intriguing nose.

A solid, thick mouthfeel is only partially offset by an ample carbonation that seems a bit out of place in a beer like this.  Luckily a quick swirl and the carbonation is gone; I much prefer more carbonation than less, as I can always get rid of the former.  Ah yes, it is much creamier with less carbonation, and it still has just a touch of prickly carbonation.  This is a malt lovers dream and exactly what I was in the mood for right now.  I get notes of just barely sweet caramel, rich toffee, ample toasted grain, hints of chocolate and something good that I can only describe as a mix of dust from freshly crushed biscuit and melanoid malts.  Underneath all of this malt is something unexpected.  It is hops of course, subtly at first in the background, but here the whole time.  Supporting the huge malt notes, the hops supply a substantial bitterness from start to finish.  They also supply some fruit character, which amplifies the fruit notes from the malt; I get notes of figs and raisins (from the malt), moving to a currant/ berry component that is contributed by the hops.  The hops also bring a touch of spiciness and a hint of herbal character as well.

This beer is definitely hitting the spot; rich, chewy, but not at all cloying, with a surprising depth of hop character, but only if you look for it underneath all that malt character.  There is perhaps a bit of hot alcohol, at times, in the finish, but nothing too detracting.  As the beer warms up, it becomes even maltier and richer; quite nice, yet always with that off-setting bitterness, which, just keeps the malt in check, well makes a valiant attempt to anyway.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Mostly clear, with small, infrequent bubbles creating a moderate amount of light beige head with fair retention, but little to no lacing.  The nose shows silky, milk chocolate sweetness complemented by light bready brown malt notes, a touch of light hazelnuts and even some mild wood smoke.  Dry dark fruits are not so much pungent/tart as they are lightly fruity and mildly acidic.  Aroma strength is quite high as well.  The flavor is steeped in chocolate, with a touch of sweet raisins, rich caramel and brown sugar.  Crusty, dry brown bread and some green, floral and juicy hops add a drying balance.  Some cinnamon and pepper-like ntoes seem out of place for a scotch ale, as its not quite fully clean when I think it should be, but no DMS that I have found in other Highland beers.

Stacks and stacks of everchanging malt flavors. Muted phenols fuse with just enough fluffiness to complement the slight tackiness. Artfully placed powdery malt textures softly dust the palate with a cocoa-laced dryness and enhance the lusher malt elements. Very juicy, as well.

The body looked almost like molten Hersheys chocolate syrup, due to its dark brown color, and opacity.  The head was rather small at first, and then wend down in a hurry.  The wispy spider web lacing left however was quite good.

The nose was very malty, with an elegant peat accent.  Toffee, chocolate, and coffee aromas filled the nostrils with each breath.  Floral hops were there to brighten things up a little bit.  The taste was just what the aromas had been proclaiming in advance.  Sweet, smoky, and robustly malty, this was undoubtedly Scottish in the flavor profile, but with a little more bitter and citric hop flavor coming through, thanks to being brewed in the Appalachian highlands instead.

I loved the way this beer felt on my tongue.  The body was thick enough to be coating, but not so stout to be chewy.  The velvety smooth swallows had enough of a prickly hop and alcohol bite to them to keep things interesting, but not so much that beer felt dry or astringent.  If there is such a thing as perfect balance in mouthfeel, this one had achieved it.  The aftertaste was more bitter than sweet, which served the purpose of drawing me in to take the next sip.  Drinkability was much better that I was thinking it was going to be.

What a great leap forward for North Carolina!  Welcome, northern neighbors to the wider world of beer.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

Thanks Blackie.","Rochester, New York, USA","JahNoth"

Toasty, chocolatey aroma, with definite roasted malt character.  Dark fruit appears in the body (cherries, berries?), in addition to heavy toasts, chocolate, and roasted malts.  Just the right touch of sweetness, reminding me in some ways of Bells Double Cream Stout (a favorite).  A very good Scotch Ale, and it is a departure, but a very good one.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
684,"2005-12-19",4.0,"Deep, background brown with some safire translucency when put to light.  Tiny, faint tan galaxy formation for the head.  Milk chocolate introduces the tamed nose, with peat, barley bags, Cocoa Puffs cereal and butterscotch serving as its brethren.  Flavor whomp antecedes the otherwise mild aroma.  Chocolate toffee and an evident scotch booze meld together to put on a sweet malt clinic and a prime example of how good a scotch ale can bee.  Spicy peppered brown bread at a fairly formidable degree.  Brown sugar sweetness intermingling with subtle pumpernickel and rye.  Sweet chocolate covered pecans and an admirable, top-shelf single malt scotch, and a finish trailing with a modest twang of spicy butterscotch.  Big thanks to Silphium for sharing!","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
684,"2005-12-18",4.0,"Dark bown pour and a medium tan head that laces pretty well. Aroma is earthy, slilghtly smoky, and with a touch of bread. Smooth, medium mouthfeel, and a light, tingly carbonation, perhaps a little too much. Roasted barley and spicy hops lead to a surprisingly medium dry finish with a trace of alcohol noted. Very fine. The best from Highland that Ive tasted. Nice to see my home state brewers getting it right.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"

Nice Scotch flavor, some peat, coffee, and toffee.  Significant hoppiness mid swallow that leads to a well balanced finish with chocolate notes and alcohol warmth.  Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, leading to a slightly syrupy finish.  Nice take on a Scotch Ale, increased hoppiness noted, but it seems to fit in really well with this beer.

Malty aroma with a touch of raisin sweetness. Dark amber/red at the base of the glass and black toward the top. Two finger thick tan head.

Aromas of roasty malt, chocoff, some nuts, prunes, and brown sugar hit me, leading to the flavors of roast malt, with some brown sugar, anise, prunes, and some almonds.

684,"2005-11-12",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2005 Bottled version. This is officially the first bottled high gravity beer from North Carolina that Ive had. Mostly clear brown color with a nice thick tan head. Very malty aroma with a healthy amount of caramel. There is a very nice hop presence in this beer that compliments the brown sugar and raisin flavors very nicely. A very enjoyable beer and Im extremely excited that NC brewers finally have the opportunity to make this type of thing.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"
684,"2005-11-01",3.6,"Draft, Great Decatur Beerfest.  Clear brown.  Caramel molasses sweet malt aroma and some peat to it.  Fairly large caramel malty flavors and some fruity raisin notes.  Alcohol was upfront and peppery.","Norcross, Georgia, USA","beeryum"
684,"2005-11-01",4.0,"22 oz bottle, snifter.  Deep and mostly clear brown-garnet-ruby hue with an initially huge, creamy, tan head.  The head is slowly diminishing and leaves behing spots of lacing and a thin sheet of fine bubbles of the beer.  First impression is of strong and sweet malts in the vein of caramel, toffee, and raisins.  Light chocolate, red grapes, peat, and an earthy hop presence as well.  The house aroma of Highland is unmistakeable and perhaps well described as mocha and light dust.  Coffee, walnuts and pure, dark, bready malts are apparent as it warms.  Theres a lot going on in the aroma and its well integrated without being muddled.  Starts with a robust malt sweetness and pleasingly non-existant acidity.  A slight alcohol tinge, but more of the warming rather than bitting variety.  Backend is flush with more malt sweetness and mild noble hop bitterness.  Medium to full bodied, with a creamy texture, and soft carbonation.  Im a fan of scotch ales in general and this is both a good example and not.  Its a really damn tasty interpretation, Im having fun drinking this, but its like a scotch ale meets an alt meets a porter.  Good stuff, good stuff.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

684,"2005-10-23",4.0,"Dark brown body with good carbonation. Good, malty aroma with a touch of alcohol. The flavor is full of caramel and toffee maltiness. The ""increased hop level"" is still mild compared to the malty rampage, and the bitterness and aroma lent by the hops is just barely more of a contribution than what it provided by the alcohol. Very drinkable given its size.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
