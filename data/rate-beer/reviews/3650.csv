3650,"2017-06-09",4.0,"Sampled in a glass poured from a bottle, 
this ale had a dark brown murky pour and gave a light tan colored lasting head of bubbles that had a yellow tint to them, there was nice spots and small fingers of lacing on the glass, 

the nose was malty and had aromas of caramel, a little dark fruit that resembled raisin and fig, some alcohol esters, faint earth notes, 
caramel candy and dark sugar sweetness, 

the flavors were malty, intense toasted malt with caramel and a little toffee, and toasted sweet bread, 
the finish had a light alcohol bitterness with malt and sweetness following, 

the mouth feel was pretty full and layered the tongue, it was a little creamy and had soft to average carbonation, faint warmth with each sip, 

the nose was very malty, lots of caramel and caramel like notes, toffee and faint dark fruit, 
the flavor was similar with a light alcohol bitterness and warmth on the mouth, 
this beer would be a good sipper on a cold evening.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

3650,"2016-09-07",4.7,"Bottled: 02/27/14. Sampled: 02/28/16

Appearance: Dark, cloudy brown with amber highlights; thin beige head. There are huge chunks of yeast sediment at the end of the beer! The total amount is equivalent to what youd expect from Belgian ales.
Smell: Hella malts and even more dark fruits; doesnt change much after warming up.
Taste: Starts off with subtle, creamy malts before developing into a bold, sweet middle thats filled with dark fruits, caramel, toffee, & chocolates. The finish is reserved for a soft hoppy flavor thats prolonged with warm alcohol. Once warm, all the sweetness gets a bump and the alcohol certainly intensifies as well; it becomes very much like a sherry wine after some time in the glass.
Texture: Smooth, full-bodied, no carb, dry finish.
Drinkability: Delicious and absolutely wonder. This is a malt & sugar bomb. The alcohol is strong enough sustain some age. Oh, and share this with a friend!

Additional thoughts:
Overall tastes remind me of a doppelsticke (strong altbier) from Germany. So malty, sweet, & boozy with the benefits of age thrown in there. Also comparable to strong winter ales from Belgian breweries like Scaldis & Corsendonk.","California, USA","beer_queue"

3650,"2015-02-08",3.7,"July 10th, 2013 - I had the pleasure of enjoying this beauty at the brewery itself - a dark, sweet sultry beer which is RIGHT inside of Alesmiths bailiwick. I trust these guys to do dark beers well, and they follow through with their Old Ale. Im covering both versions in this review: a draft and a cask. Both smelled similarly, with a dark, clove riddled scent. The flavor on the draft version is chocolatey, malty, boozey and coated in molasses - like when sugar on a rich, dark chocolate bar begins to crystallize. Its the pure essence of dark and sweet. The cask smells much like the draft, but the flavor is remarkably different. Here the palate is obviously flatter, and strikes out on a less sweet and sugary path, tasting more of teriyaki and tempura sauces with a savory quality that complements the sweet. Both are excellent beers, and excellent contributions to the tap list.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Pours a very dark brown color with a fairly large head for the style. Bubbly tan head with a good cap and collar throughout. The nose has a subtle sweetness with a bit of fruit and some caramel plus brown sugar. Slight amount of booze there as well. The taste is a bit more plain and quite mellow. Booze comes back again. There is a slight brown-sugar sweetness there and mild fruits throughout. This is good, but not the caliber I expect from AleSmith. The feel consists of a medium body with light carbonation. This is pretty drinkable for now, but it seems like it needs more time to mellow out a bit.

3650,"2011-01-28",4.6,"True to its name, the Alesmith Decadence is a conversation between the Baroque and the Gothic. It transports one to a time in which Handel reigned supreme and Hildegaard of Bingen was not far behind. This is a prude beer as it gives no head, or not quite enough to get your engine a-running. That being said, this beer is quite promiscuous; youre just another notch on its proverbial belt. What it lacks in prudence it more than makes up for in acumen. The smell is of lavender, yellow roses, and charred Yugoslavian horned melon. One can see ones own past, present, and future upon gazing into her spiraling depths - an oracle, of sorts. It lavishes the tongue in a style reminiscent of the fresh milk of the renowned Northern Flemish steer. And the taste? Sublime: hints of blue grapes, smoked caramel, non-pareils, ecstasy, candied chestnuts, beer, and Latvian leeks. In a word: not bad. This beer is more fit to bathe in than to sup. Yet sup I will, I shall - nay, I must. And oh, how I shall sup!","Connecticut, USA","kyedumo"

Nice smells of candy, grapes, cognac and barleywine. The flavor was toffee, caramel, really nice. I will say this is better barrel-aged because it adds a boozy, bourbon-vanilla but still the regular version is an excellent barleywine/old ale and the 11% ABV is completely hidden.

3650,"2008-12-23",3.3,"UPDATED: AUG 18, 2015 2005 Bottle aged approximately one year.Raw, fresh and messy in the nose, it certainly has that unpasteurized, unfiltered feel to it that is so appealing about alesmith.  Unfortunately, the hops are decidedly obnoxious and burst forth with cherry, lychee, grapefruit and orange peel notes, dominating the aroma and limiting the malt presence to a sugary chocolate-meets-caramelized raisin.  The flavor, then, is not surprisingly heavy on the hops and Im amazed at how bitter and bold they are after a year in the bottle.  Oranges and ruby red grapefruit dominate the opening, with a wash of toffee in the middle that is in turn enveloped by staunch bitterness and alcohol on the end.  Low carbonation, and fat malts lead to a typical hop lovers mess but as usual, I dont approve.  Would be more interested to try a bottle with 3 years of age on it now.  Interesting, anyways, and wholesome, but too messy for me.2010 Decadence bottle drunk 8/14/15.Well, the hops certainly werent a problem this time and as far as old ales go, it does have some enjoyable malt flavors of toffee, caramel, plums, raisins, vanilla and the alcohol somewhat dries it out.

Pours with a dark amber hue that sit belows a small light brown head that is mostly diminishing. 
Aroma is of dark fruits, berries, molasses, caramel, and alcohol.

3650,"2008-12-18",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 29, 2010 2005 Version : Bottle thanks to Sam at Stuffed Sandwiches for what I consider a steal at 17 dollars.  Pours with a light brown bubbly head and a murky dark amber body with some yeasties. Acceptable lacing, but nothing special, but good for an 11 percent 4 year old beer. Aroma of dark fruits, berries, chocolate caramel and a slight vinous note. Very decadent. Taste is caramel, berries, toffee, dried and dark fruits with a vinous and yeasty note. Currants and raisins dominate as it warms. Syrupy and creamy mouthfeel that completely coats while the alcohol warms you. Bubbles were in the background and didnt detract from the amazing drinking experience. 948516:4.2
2010 version: Bottle (($12.99). Pours with a medium sized tan head over a hazed deep brown body. Aromas of strong brown sugar, molasses and caramel. Rich, decadent and deep, light dark fruits. I am opening this a bit cold, so it might need to warm a bit to give me its full bouquet, but I can tell you, even cold it smells fantastic!. Toffee! Some anise, cola, sarsaparilla, chocolate. Taste is rich, cola, chocolate, toffee, light burnt caramel. Quite a lot of kettle caramelization. Burnt toffee, molasses, awesomeness! Big bodied, but creamy and smooth. Excellent.

3650,"2008-10-31",4.5,"25 oz bottle, consumed Aug 2008.  Pours a beautiful clear amber to dark copper body with a small fizzy beige head that faded to a thin ring.  Lotsa carbonation visible.  The nose is richly malty with dark caramel, burnt toffee, cocoa, figs, and marzipan.  Some very light sherry like oxidation, and a touch of alcohol.  Reminds me in alot of ways of aged North Coast Old Stock.  The flavor reminds me of NC Old Stock as well.  Big rich and deep toffee and caramel maltiness with perfect attenuation, it’s not cloying or tiring on the palate at all.  I really love the aged character of this, it has really mellowed and smoothed out incredibly from when it was fresh and rather hot.  The alcohol is reallty minimally noticable.  Finishes with a little cocoa and fig fruitiness, maybe even a touch of coffee.  The feel of it is just so smooth and easy drinking it’s extremely hard to believe that this is 10% ABV.  Sometimes I’m a big stickler for carbonation and the soft gentle nature of this suits it well.  I had to break out an 04 NC Old Stock to drink side by side with this, and while the OS is a bit darker and has a bit more toffee, the comparison has some validity.  Wish I had more of these to cellar.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

750 ml bottle shared by Indra. Pour is a slight haze golden orange cordovan with a smallish light tan head. Head breaks down to bigger bubbles. Aroma of dusty earthy hazelnut maltiness, some floral, some light oxidation way in the back. Behind all of this is some dry fruit which shows some mild cherry sweetness. Taste is mild soft caramel sweetness, the hazelnut, and followed by some resin earthiness.  It amazingly seems to have a mild resin hop bitterness. The oxidation is present, but works really nicely to meld and smooth out the flavors. Palate is medium to heavy, coats the mouth a bit, then transitions to be dry and leafy in the finish.

Rating #800 - Sitting in the cellar for a special occasion I decided to crack this open for a milestone.  It seems to be at a nice age for drinking.  If you have a bottle on hand I would try to drink it within the next six months.  While it is still a bit warm some of the flavors are beginning to mellow.
Aroma / Appearance - There was no head despite a fairly aggressive attempt to create one while swirling.  The deep red body was mellow and created a sticky line of lacing around the top of the glass.  The nose of caramel, cedar and cherry syrup reminded me of an aged barleywine.  Very thick it caught in the nose and lingered.
Flavor / Palate - The thick warm mouthfeel could have been toned back a little bit but the 11% alcohol is not over the top.  Molasses, caramel and resin crawled across the tongue towards the throat.  The wet finish highlights the conversion to chocolaty resin.  With a little more time this would not be as enjoyable; Im glad to have opened it when I did.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3650,"2007-12-14",3.5,"Sampled December 2007
A vigorous pour produces a fat, one-finger thick, amber tinged tan colored head.  The beer sits in my glass a dark amber hued, brown color, but shows an almost brilliantly clear, cranberry color when held up to the light.  The carbonation is visually slight, with only a few lonely bubbles working there way through the glass at a time.  The aroma has quite a dusty malt character to it, with lots of toasted grain notes and browned artisanal bread crust aromatics.  It still has a sweet smelling character to it, which definitely accentuates fruit notes of berries and perhaps some raisin like aromas.  The hot alcohol that was in this beer when I first had it seems to have toned down significantly as it just plays a role in the background; it produces some aromatics notes that make me think of molasses rum.  The aroma has a bit too much of a grain husk like sharpness to it, but it still has vastly improved.

Sweet and viscous feeling, this beer definitely has a creamy mouthfeel to it.  The slight carbonation adds just a touch of a sparkle towards the finish.  Dark, toasted malt flavors play a big role here; sharp, roast grain husk notes, toasted bread flavors, something that almost seems wood like at times.  This is still a bit hot in the finish, the alcohol definitely supplies ample warming character here, which isnt actually all that bad on this uncharacteristically cold, AZ night.  Slightly fruity, though not as much as the aroma would have suggested, flavors of raisins, a touch of berry notes and at times a hint of cherry.  These notes are joined by complimentary flavors reminiscent of toffee, a hint of vanilla and molasses.  The alcohol, along with the fruit notes provides something like the finish of a brandy.  A solid, yet initially unnoticed because of all of the malt sweetness, bitterness is found in the finish, it lingers a bit and slowly wins out over the malt sugars.  Most definitely a chewy, sipping beer; thick and rich, a beer to be savored slowly over an evening in front of the fire.

This has definitely vastly improved ; initially it was something I would only just want to drink a full glass of.  It still has a ways to go though, and I still think that it will improve for at least another year, if not even significantly longer.  The beer still needs to soften up a bit, and a bit of oxidation should add some needed complexity.

Sampled October, 2005
6/4/6/4/12 total of 3.2
Pours a clear rich amber color and is topped by a frothy amber tan colored head.  The aroma is fruity and malty; a mix of sticky toffee, cherry, and sharp alcohol.  The aroma seems a bit too strongly towards the alcohol side of the spectrum, at least initially.

The taste is quite sweet and full in the palate, and the finish has a strong, hot alcohol note to it.  In the finish is also a roasted astringency that has notes of coffee.  As my palate becomes used to it the beer loses its initial sticky sweetness; it still tastes strongly of caramel and toffee but becomes a bit more richer.  This beer is definitely on the young side, in fact this needs at least 6 months, but probably more like 2 years before it comes into its own.  This beer actually has quite a bit of potential, but I wish that the brewery had brewed this two years earlier for this 10 year anniversary.  I expect my ratings for this to go up as time passes.

3650,"2007-03-08",4.5,"Bottle from silphium (he provided me one to actually drink to go with the one I got myself that Ive been hoarding for nearly 1.5 years already). Aroma is a beautiful mixture of ripe fruit and interesting vegetables, not vegetal but highlighting such things as beets, hearts of palm, red pepper, orange, lilac, lime, and fresh tea leaf. Flavor is non-aggressive, very mellow molasses, brown sugar characteristics but not that sweet, rum, toffee, tobacco. Incredibly well balanced and extremely drinkable, this beer has aged in a way other beers can only dream of. Though not huge like typical RB top 100s, the complexity and craft in this beer are outstanding, and deserves to be in a class with the best out there. It is truly rare that one can sip an 11% beer so elegant and enjoyable.

Burnished bronze-gold with copper-mahogany highlights and the full color spectrum in between as it thins out to the edge.  Very low carbonation at this age.  Roasted malt aromas caramel sweetness with vanilla and oak gives way to a multi-dimensional flavor profile with many layers of malted grain, roast, sweetness, aging characteristics (maderization, etc.), and an incredibly long, full chromatic toffee finish.

3650,"2006-09-22",3.7,"This was a unique beer, and was not what I was expecting. When cold, the smell and taste were very bourbonesque, tasting as though it had just come from the barrel, but as the beer warmed up, it became sweet and malty, similar to their Grand Cru offering, but not nearly as overwhelming. The beer poured a dark, malty, murky caramel color with a small off-white head. Aroma started off as being very full of alcohol, but became much sweeter and caramel-like as it warmed up. Taste was very similar, very malty, with a nice but not overpowering taste of alcohol in the finish.

The sweetness, fruit notes, caramel, and other flavors come to the fore.  The finish lingers pleasantly as the warmth hits your stomache.

Its my 600th rate. The ratebeerian who sent me this beer just celebrated his first anniversary for a wedding that I was the best man at, a year ago. Today is the first day of August, marking the autumnal swing of the avian world, where birds begin to head south. Friday, its my birthday. So this Anniversary Ale, of epic celebratory proportions is the perfect choice to mark all these occasions! I undress the bottle of its gold foil crown and pop the top. A light psst, then the silky pour into a goblet. Immeadiately, rich aged brandy soaked fruits tickle my nostrils. Theres incredible maturity in those alcohol tones, from aged bourbon black cake to maciated figs in cognac. Exotic dessert spices dance on the surface and waft gently up the nose. Pineapple, pound cake and a whole slew of indescribable nuanced characters erupt from the snifter. The pour is a fiery core of mostly clear ruby-hued liquors, with golden-orange fringes, a light carbonation, a fine mist of yeast particles across the beer and a lacy edge of tawny head. On the tounge, a elicitation of the aroma, with perky pineapple candies, rich creamed malts, replete with a touch of Marakesh spice and squeezed raisin juice. The alcohols unleash a fiery blast of warmth into the humours, but Im not taken aback, only encouraged and pleased with the gentle heat and the sophistication it brings. In the middle, these fires meld with a tart candied lemon rind and the whole wash of sugary and creamy malt characters, in a heavenly blend of various sugars and grains. This is heavly refined. In the backend, theres a light bite of British hop bite, but only so much to create balance, without overpowering what an Old Ale should be. Damn, I love balance. Here, Im not taken aback by the lack of carbonation, or the alcoholic fury. This beer is worthy to be something to celebrate with any time. Later, Ill use it as a deglazing liquid for butter sauteed nectarines and rain","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

3650,"2006-05-14",3.2,"UPDATED: JUL 23, 2013 RERATE 7/23/2013. Its been years since Ive had this and I still do not see how this is rated so highly. Reading my old review is interesting in that this doesnt come off as alcoholic at all, its very nicely balanced. However, its just an 11% beer with not much going on. 6/4/6/4/12. Probably the most overrated Alesmith beer there is. 


I opened this out of paranoia. Thats gotta be a first. Im going on a plane tomorrow, and a case of Alesmith I had sent back with someone else had a bottle break. I evenlucked out and got an inspection paper. Since Ill never get this one again and I because as a white male I might quality as a terrorist, I decided to open it. Poured a murky dark amber body with a fairly large head. Although, I did pour this like a complete jackass since the glass Im using holds over 1L. The first scent of the aroma says hello, Im at least 10% abv. And.. it is. Aroma is like an Imperial Strong English Ale. Alcohol, caramel, some darker fruits, minor hops, and probably more. Came off with a fairly sweet but alcoholic finish. I think their championship yeast strain helped save this one from complete disaster. If I find another bottle Ill age it 5 or so years and see what happens. But, it was still better than the last Decadence I had... Weyerbachers.","California, USA","ABUSEDGOAT"

3650,"2006-04-25",4.3,"Chestnut-hued, under tight, tan top.

Earthy, nutty aroma, caramel flavor, mixed with spice and fruit esters. A heady, burgundy-esque blend. Noice.

Delectable and deep at once, a bold entry on the palate, hanging full with weighty flavors. Sticks long on the tastebuds, rolls around with imperious aplomb, a brilliant mix of delicious malt, and just enough hops. Lip-smacking delight.

11%? I can feel it coming on...this is a fine, fine barleywine that will put an excellent close to the day. Half the bottle left...means Im gonna feel twice as good when its time to hit the hay.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
3650,"2006-04-22",4.2,"From Bottle.  Fiery up-north late night summer sunset spalsh into the snifter glass along with a delicate layer of beige head.  Deliciously sweet aromas of white grape, tons of strawberry, and some creamy raspberry sherbet.  Sweet tropical layers of pineapple and mango pile on with the vinous qualities of a well-crafted muscat.  Milky, creamy mouthfeel that brings a flourish of darker ripened fruits.  Initially, some spiced fig, dried apricots, and green raisin.  Secondly, some white pepper, honey, and a bitter hoppiness of sticky red pine sap.  Final smack of a sticky, oaky, caramelly whiskey.  This beer is amazing in the way its able to bring many of my favorite things together into a neat little package.    It has the vinous qualities of a fine dessert wine, the depth of an elegant dinner - I can imagine a sweet honey bourbon glaze resting on top of a grilled pork tenderloin, and the Friday night nightcap of a tongue tingling, mouth watering, neat single malt scotch whiskey.  A fitting name for an expertly crafted, favorably complex brew.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
3650,"2006-04-20",4.0,"04.20.06  750ml bottle.  After having a few samples over the last six months or so, Im ready to give it a go.  Thanks to sprinkle, I think, for supplying the bottle.  Pretty pour on this stuff, its ruby brown with teakwood highlights and the slowly fading khaki head leaves sturdy islands of lace.  Aroma is now spot on what I most crave in big old ales and english-type barley wines - its full of rummy raisins, melting brown sugar in an iron pot, the slightest of brine, and a damp autumn waft through the woodshed rafters with the seasons slight dust and molding bark.   Okay, that may have been over the line, but the smell is damn fine.  The anticipation is of a sweet and full brew with touches of mineral and a finish of old wet wood.  In fact, the beer does not disappoint.  Sherry and wood port notes bloom across the palate in the warmth of potent alcohol, which has finally retreated from its youthful power play.  Entrancing stuff, and entirely intoxicating.  The finish comes around slowly, and its dry, maybe too dry as temps rise, but a bounty of dried fruits temper what could be unpleasant and further mask any alcoholic unpleasantness.  The body never gets around to the thick and really full feeling that Id hoped for, and in fact seems at times at odds with the drying finish.  Its good, but I think it might still get better.","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

3650,"2006-04-09",4.4,"For my first rating after a long hiatus, I wanted something a little out of the ordinary, so I opted for a bottle of Alesmith Decadence that I have had aging for over a year.  Poured it into my snifter with no head at all, a deep mahogany/ruby coloring, and very clear when held up to the light.  The aroma was sweet, vinuous, resiny, with just a hint of alcohol.  Initial sip was sweet, with mildly spicey afternotes and just a hint of alcohol burn.  Not at all grainy or overbearing, and just enough hop presence to keep it from being cloyingly sweet.  Overall  a very pleasant drink for a chilly spring evening, preferrably shared with good company since it is rather potent and comes in a 750ml champagne bottle sizing.","Portland, Oregon, USA","AxeMaster221"

Body is medium with touches of thinness showing at times, probably my biggest knock against this beer.  A bit boozy also at nine months of age.

The nose has an old ale quality for sure with a cellared oxidition on top of grassy (and just a bit of pine) hops and carmelized maltings. Some nice prune, plum, and vinous notes before a woody cask like vapor dances about, a little Funnel spice as well to be found.
The taste starts slightly twangy with a underdeveloped fruit and bitter qualty over a aged grainy and herbal malt base.  It wants to be vinous and rich but still has not the time to achieve the level needed to be great...LET THIS AGE SOME MORE IF YOU GOT ONE LEFT. The alcohol presence is still to much at the forefront to enjoy all the sublime flavors found within. The yeast still has not seem to fully finish to job. You can tell there is another level to this beer yet to come about and when it does this will be classic IMO. Oh, back to the tasting, there is a peppery finish that I like.

Hard to pin the mouthfeel down - its in turns thick, creamy, alcoholic and bitter.

Tastes sweet and malty with some raisin and prune elements.  Alcohol presence makes it a bit hot.  Needs another year to settle down a bit.  Ill probably revisit this one again next year to see how the alcohols doing.  Mouthfeel is thick and oily, but the finish isnt quite there.  Not as balanced as Im used to.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
3650,"2005-12-17",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2007 My bottle.  Sampled at the MKE YeHA!  Approximately on 12/17/2005.  Pours to a red-mahogany body with a slick white head.

Jasons bottle on 03/27/2007.  A delight.  The alcohol has mellowed significantly.  Rich malts, random spices, light anise, aged barley.  mmmm.  Rich full bodied palate that is approaching perfect.

Pours a thick woody-brown with a heavy aroma of raisin, yeast, and a touch of strawberry.  Taste is a bit underwhelming considering the strong aroma, but it still packs a punch.

Moderately hazy garnet-amber body with a strong, fairly large, creamy off-yellow head.  Starts quite sweet.  Almost cloying.  Tons of caramel and toffee sugars are present here.  Light toastiness, and some cereal, too.  Becomes a little warming at the end, but ethanol is still hid well.  A bit of a bitter ethanolic finish, though.  Some fleeting butterscotch, too.

So it pours a dark red with a thin cream head.  Aroma has some roasty malt and chocolate with a decent presence of some berry and dark fruit.  There is a nice balance in this beers aroma.  There is a pretty decent hop presence towards the end of this beer, but it comes off after a good malt sweetness that keeps that together.  I got a small aftertaste of yeast and fruity sugar feel after the hops fade and the alcohol presence fades.

3650,"2005-11-29",4.8,"UPDATED: DEC 5, 2005 I was hesitant to open the bottle I had just purchased, because Id been forewarned about its youth....I expected some real alcohol heat, along with a fading head, and a too sharp flavor profile over all...boy, was I surprised!

TTHe nose, and the palate pretty much fell into alignment...there was a HUGE aroma, replete with dates, figs, prunes, butterscotch, chocolate, mandarin orange slices, and even a touch of anise lurking in the background.

The flavor was similar, augmented by the AMAZING mouthfeel, which was velvety, and silky, and served as a beautiful conveyor of all those rich, ripe, and luscious flavors...this ale may age really well, but believe me, it is READY to drink right now...incredible balance for the amount of malt and hops employed in the brew kettle...there is a definite hoppy finish that goies on and on, but it is so interwoven with the malt that it is almost impossible to determine where the malt ends, and the hops begin.

Yes, there is definitely aging room for this sophisticated behemoth,,,there is still a bit of excess heat from the alcohol, and the flavors could stand a bit more melding, but over all, this is my FAVORITE Alesmith brew...lots of sophistication, but just as much OOMPH to balance that off.

The nose is nearly undecernable with notes of bready yeast, candied cherries, burnt sugar, a red wine reduction and some buttery toffee.  The complexities continue as this beast explodes on the tongue.  The mouthfeel is still highly alcoholic but far more subdued than when I had a fresh bottle years ago.  The roasted malts taste warm and faintly sour, and the sweet toffee flavors meld with dried dark fruit notes and a vineous, again almost sour, background.

3650,"2005-11-09",3.4,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2006 The Lure:Muted maltiness proffers roastiness and alcohol to support the grapey fruitiness. Aromas are joined with diplomacy, but a firm hand is put upon them, and they cannot express themselves as theyd like.

The Festivities:Firey alcohol plagues the frail body and frightens the tongue at the onset. Roasted malt aptly leads into bitterness, and manages to get along with the many berries. This is either too young and underdeveloped, or it does not possess the wealth and depth such a massive ale deserves. Ill have to wait and see.

Seems to have a juvenile quality. After the first few sips this is going to be a long and tedious journey. Heavy malt flavors are quickly taken over by fruit and alcohol. Light pepper and mild acidic finish. Actually the further I get with this one the more I am coming to grips with it. This is a very legitimate old ale. Yes, it is strong and foreboding,  Yes it is sweet and oily, yes it is malty and fruity. Flavors run from dried figs to sweet sherry. Some nuts and spices are thrown into the mix. If anything, this is overhopped and much to young. But age will heal these wound. I started not thinking I would enjoy this one and have come to agreement with it that I see the merits of the present and look forward to the future (maybe 3 to 5 years should be good).

3650,"2005-10-11",4.1,"Number 1,000.  Beautiful safire hue and mostly translucent in appearance with a variable head ranging from bubble cloisters in the beginning to a thin layer of tan fizzles on other pours.  Aroma is ripe with intricacy, calling on amaretto, akin to Disaronno, and a hearty fruit profile consisting of figs, dried apricot chews, maraschino cherries, golden raisins and a generate of melding squished plums with red grapes.  Honeyed caskets and caramelized pecans sweetly echo in the nose as well.  First dactylic sensation to register is the palate positioning - oily, like a custom wax mold in the mouth.  Flavor ensues with a heavy suckle sense (honey, rose) in cohorts with the anticipated amaretto, along with cedar, liquefied brown sugar and black cherries.  Buttery pralines come in, projecting a character trait of being rolled around in brown sugar and basking in brandy for some time.  Alcohol is discernable but not a hindrance.  Malt driven, no question about it, with the mouth feel headlining the bill of this 10-year anniversary arrangement.  Finishes with a sweet and somber caramel sense that transitions to a lasting memory of cherry cordials pumped with liqueur.

Strong concentrated malt aromas immediately remind of desserty flavours, the likes of chocolate, caramel and herbed cereals. Fitting figgy fruits are quickly put down by the stronger fuelic earthiness, leaning onto tobacco territory. Faint smokiness turns chalky as the moderately astringent hops kick in.

3650,"2005-09-03",4.0,"(Draft and Cask: AleSmith Brewing Company, Liars’ Club, & O’Brien’s in San Diego, CA) I’ve now had this beer on three occasions -- twice on draft and once on cask -- and while it’s clear that this is a beer meant to be enjoyed after a year or so of aging, I’m putting up a review now to show the progress this beer will make over time.  It’s big, malty, sweet and very caramely, kind of like a Scotch ale, but also shows a fairly strong bitterness and some spiciness so that the beer isn’t just a sugar bomb.  The problem the kegs are showing is the alcohol.  It’s very evident, even a bit overwhelming, and this beer clearly need aging to smooth that out.  Also, the alcohol is pleasant when the beer is cold, but as it warms up, that’s when the alcohol really takes hold.  Malt and sweet caramel in the nose, but again, lots of alcohol.  Full bodied and heavy, but not syrupy, thanks to the ample hops.  Beautiful ruddy brown color is fairly clear in appearance.  Light tan head fades to a small ring, leaving only a few traces of lace.  Solid, but too hot unless you drink it cold.  Until I had it on cask, I was prepared to give this only a 3.6.Now, on cask, I think we can begin to see where this beer will be heading as it ages.  The alcohol is still fairly pronounced, but not quite to the point of being overwhelming.  It also seems more hoppy.  I couldn’t taste hops in the draft version, but on cask, I actually can taste hops.  I presume that, too, will mellow out over time.  But I think the cask version is much better, more enjoyable, more ""ready"", and so my ratings numbers are based on this.  Anyway, this is in no way a final review of this beer.  And those who acquire a bottle should resist the urge to be among the first to rate this very young beer and exercise patience for they will be rewarded handsomely.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
3650,"2005-09-03",4.2,"I find this a very interesting beer.  the aroma to me smells like baileys irish cream, and vanilla mixed together.  Its very pleasant actually.the pour is good, its a nice rich amber, the only thing bad I can say is that my bottle wasnt too carbonated, but honestly I dont get too many Alesmith beers that are.  Thankfully I dont think this affects the flavor which is very different and more interesting then the rest of the Alesmith line up.  Its got a solid old ale taste to it, but theres a bit of an english twist to it with a solid almost vanilla like warming aftertaste thats very enjoyable.  Its been mentioned before that this will be money in a year or so and I totally agree.  Also, Ive had this on cask twice and it is amazing, I think as of this posting there is only one cask of this beer left.  It is well worth it to get a pint of that.
