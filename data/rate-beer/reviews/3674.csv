I¬íve enjoyed this previously and was sorry to see it leave as a seasonal, but with the current proliferation of porters, stouts and darker strong seasonal ales, this one seems now to get lost in a tsunami of newer and better brews. It¬ís still fine, quite malt heavy and hop bitter as well. Not well rounded, however, and despite the ABV, it tastes like an over the top porter. Possibly I just don¬ít understand what an old ale is, or possibly that¬ís just some vague delineation describing brews that don¬ít really fit conveniently into any more well known category.

3674,"2014-12-17",3.9,"Old Ale is not a style many breweries are doing as they were traditionally made (i.e. actually aging beer for a significant period of time). Most breweries just brew a barleywine ad call it an old ale, but in the case of Great Divide Hibernation Ale, it appears to be a traditional brew (according to BJCP guidelines, that is). It¬ís a good beer to drink to appreciate that dedication to classic brewing techniques, and it¬ís also a good beer to drink because it¬ís a good beer.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 8/27/14 and cost $2.99 ($0.25 per ounce).

Appearance: Dark reddish/brown hue with sediment particles in suspension. Pours to a two-finger, off-white, foamy head which laces and retains well.

Smell: Sweet confectionary aromas, especially chocolate and toffee, but with a strong dark malt base. Some dark fruit notes as well. 

Taste: It¬ís no surprise that the malts are the stars of the show here. Rich sweetness right away in the form of dark fruit notes, similar to that of a barleywine. A general m√©lange of cherry, fig and raisin as well as distinct syrupy flavors of toffee and chocolate-covered burnt toast. What¬ís curious is there¬ís actually quite a strong hop presence in the form of flavor and bitterness. I get light citrus flavors, but a fairly strong dry bitterness. There¬ís also some tanginess most likely due to oxidation (though this is normal). The alcohol imparts a warming sensation and accentuates the confectionery flavors but creating a slight vanilla character. Overall, it¬ís a tasty brew and a great example of how this style can be done today.

Drinkability: With a soft mouthfeel and smooth texture, Great Divide Hibernation Ale is quite pleasing to drink. Plenty of body and raw weight at 8.7% ABV, though there¬ís no abrasive heat from the alcohol. A slight lingering dryness on the tongue. It works well as a sipper.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

A: Pours a deep ruby brown, forming a relatively thin pale white head that recedes quickly to a ring. Holding the beer to daylight reveals an exceptionally clear red-brown brew with decent streams of carbonation from the bottom. Lacing is persistent, if a tad patchy.

S: Toasted, warm caramel-toffee malts, with the smells of warm peat moss and damp potting soil mixed in as well. There¬ís a tinge of smoke, and some shadows of dark fruit.

T: At the start, this was smoky, earthen, and definitely peaty, a bitter brew to drink. There was sweetness present, but entirely subsumed by the soil, bark, and ashes, with something of a black licorice tinge to the finish. As it warms, the bitterness fades to allow more of a balance with the sweeter, breadier malts - entirely my fault, I should have started this one out warmer. Caramel and toffee play off of the smoky earthiness, and allow some faint undertones of dried dark fruit to skitter about the distant reaches of the palate. There¬ís also more of a light coffee note to the finish.

Aroma: There is this amazing coffee aroma that leaps from the glass. It smells fantastic. A slight note of charcoal on the nose as well.

Taste: It starts out with a rich coffee and a bit of wood flavor, touched by a slight burnt note and bitterness at the back. It finishes very clean, leaving just a bit of coffee on the tongue.

3674,"2014-10-02",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 11-13-13-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance ¬ñ The beer pours a brownish mahogany color with hints of ruby red seen shining through when held up to the light. Upon pouring there is a small tan colored head that fades relatively rapidly, leaving some foamy islands on the surface of the beer and a foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell ¬ñ The aroma is big and malty with lots of sweetness. The matiness is a very nice combination of toasted malt, chocolate, and a more brown bread like smell. Mixed with these aromas are the sweet, which are heaviest of a toffee and caramel smell with other sweeter smells of molasses and candied sugar. Rounding out the sweet and malty smells are some aromas of spice accompanied by a bit of vanilla and some earthy and herbal smells as well as a little bit of a woody smell. 

 Taste ¬ñ The taste starts out with a roasted malt flavor melding with some flavors of chocolate and caramel. The caramel flavors become more buttery as the taste moves on to the middle, taking on a more toffee like flavor. The chocolate flavor fades some from the tongue being replaced by flavors of coffee. With the coffee so too comes some molasses and brown sugar flavors as well as a bit of spice. Other flavors of an earthy hop and a bit of herb also come to the tongue, which when combined with the coffee, brings a bit of bitterness to the taste, unfortunately taking away from the wonderfully drinkable sweet and malty flavors a bit. With a little bit of warming booziness coming to the tongue at the very end, one is left with a slightly bitter, malty and still fairly sweet taste to linger on the tongue. 

 Mouthfeel ¬ñ The body of the beer is thick in the front of the taste with it becoming more average more toward the back-end with a carbonation level that on the average side. While rather nice overall, a thicker body through the taste would have been slightly nicer for the sweet and malt, potentially holding them up in flavor to the end of the taste. 

 Overall ¬ñ For the most part it was a very nice drinking Old Ale with an amazing aroma, and a good set of sweet and malty flavors. A little less bitterness may have suited the style and my preferences a bit more, but overall it was a very nice drinking beer.","","Darkmagus82"

3674,"2014-01-04",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 24, 2015 12 oz bottle poured into brandy snifter. It starts out with the sweet smell of vanilla and chocolate, with a touch of butterscotch, with perhaps a note of earthiness to it. As the head recedes, the aroma morphs into something more similar to ripe, tart dark red cherries with some woody notes (maybe some raisin in there too?). A deep, dark cranberry coloring to the beer stands out (although it¬ís probably more mahogany, but the fluorescent lighting is playing tricks on me) with a tan head that sits atop the beer as a moderate to thin film with some sparse lacing. A moderate sweet-tartness is most noticeable, in moderate amounts, with some light toasty, woody notes. After a little time, some hop bitterness pokes through along with a touch of sour cherry. An average amount of carbonation keeps the beer relatively medium to light bodied, although it definitely has a slightly syrupy quality to it. There¬ís a mild aftertaste consisting mainly of toasted malt with some dark chocolate and floral notes. By mid-glass, this taste changes into a smooth caramel with some light spice - the floral notes are still present. There¬ís a pleasant warming quality to this beer at the finish.

One year later, this same batch take on more roasted notes of coffee, raisin, and cacao with some port wine alcohol, a hint of ginerbread, and grapes late. The color of the beer is now an oily dark caramel brown color with noticeable sediment floating within. The head thins out a bit with just a thin soapy ring and a wispy surface. The body gains some weight to it as the slick and slightly sticky beer is more full bodied with toasted notes and flavors of cacao. There¬ís an earthiness as well as a touch of a metallic and burnt characters and a hint of gingerbread. It finishes with a port wine warmth and a clean resin licorice spiciness. The aftertaste is astringent and slightly metallic with note of spice, dark chocolate, dark cherries, and nuts.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

An extremely dark mahogany body flashes an occasional cherry highlight, capped by a 1.5"" creamy khaki head with a frothy crown which dissipates within a couple minutes leaving a solid ring and dense smooth lacing fading to several erratic peninsulas and islands, each vintage offering a slightly shorter, more delicate head

2013 Bottled OCT 18 2013
Dark caramel, chocolate, and pecan pie accented with coffee and lightly tart baked apple, all meshing to suggest waves of dates, the creamy medium body presents a strong additional layer of roast which resonates and dries to create deeper dried dark fruit characteristics with hints of ash

2012 Bottled AUG 31 2012
Cherry and prune juice, berry nuances, fig, caramel chocolate pie, hints of peach cobbler, fruity sweet on a smoother, cleaner palate with a fairly nondescript finish, lightly colored fruit characteristics resonate, moving back to the 2013 vintage reveals amplified coffee aromatics

2011 Bottled AUG 31 2011
Subdued dark fruit characteristics with an earthy influence, baked yellow apples, integrated, subdued components with slightly spicy yeast esters on a silky smooth, almost syrupy medium palate, as the subtle flavors resonate and build, english tea and bland muffins come to mind, the roast quality from the fresh batch returns, very earthy and subtle compared to latest vintages

2010 Bottled NOV 24 2010
Overripe light fruit and toffee initially flood the senses, blending into a flash of white wine nuances, settling on brown sugar honey drizzled melon with peach accents on a smooth medium body, working back through the aromas of all four vintages, the fresh batch comes off as pungent coffee, fruity, overripe, caramel or toffee embossed aromatics are represented in the middle vintages, and the eldest¬ís matured sweet honey and brown sugar layer is unique

Appearance: The body is clear with a deep garnet hue, such a nice color! the head is short and short lived, settling into a full tan coating with a creamy ring.
Aroma: The aroma is smokey, sort of like a cigar, very earthy, dry roast, sweet caramel and some cocoa. The aroma is bold and dry and slightly appealing.
Taste: Boy this is interesting, the intro is mildly sweet with some cocoa and caramel, smoke overlies it by the mid-taste though providing a flavor of just puffing a cigar. The cigar flavor is persistent with cocoa becoming more prominent, matching the cigar flavor, by the finish with a very slight fig flavor. The finish is dry and lingers of smoke, roasted coffee and roasted peanuts.
Palate: Full bodied with some bitey carbonation, I expected something more syrupy.

3674,"2013-01-17",3.5,"Aged 2 years, 3 months (2010 vintage): Wow, there was alot of yeast (and/or other beer stuffs) sediment that poured out of the bottle.  I¬ím having to let the glass sit for a while just so I can get it to settle so I don¬ít get a mouthful of it.  After letting it settle, it now looks like the caked dust you¬íd find on computer fan blades or outside neglected air conditioning filters.  It¬ís dark brown in color, very muddy in appearance, with an off-white head.  Despite how ugly this beer is, it smells great!  It reminds me of sweet, sticky maple syrup, raisins, and spiced cake.  The flavor tastes so much like fresh, unfermented wort from partially roasted malts that it¬ís easy to forget you¬íre drinking an Old Ale, let alone anything fermented.  It has become very soft and dull with a pasty smoothness that seems to be all thanks to the heavy suspension of caked matter that¬ís formed over the years.  As the supernate forms, the body almost begins to turn a garnet color.  It¬ís definitely interesting, but I think two-plus years is a little too much for this beer.  My advice: drink before two.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

3674,"2012-10-30",4.1,"(bottle)  Pours a clear crimson color with a thin off-white head that retains and leaves quite a bit of lacing.  Aroma holds a pleasant scent of peanut brittle, prunes, light orange zest, and dark chocolate.  I¬ím not smelling it so much in this bottle, but it other bottles I¬íve had there¬ís been a vegetal scent of celery, so this bottle is much better.  There¬ís also a bit of nuttiness that¬ís independent of the brittle that takes on the scent of hazelnuts.  Maybe some light mocha.  Flavor holds plenty more of the brittle character, with strong toffee to back it up.  A bit of dark fruit like plum flashes in on the mid.  The finish dries out on a slight toasty and roasty note, with some light roasted coffee, roasted nuts, and the ever so faint bitterness of hops at the very end.  Mouthfeel is full and carbonation is mellow.  The 8% never makes its presence known.

Smell of dark chocolate, roasted malts and coffee beans, all blending together to produce an interesting and well balance aroma.

Tasted of slightly burnt brown sugar on toast, with plums on top. Coffee appears in the aftertaste and the alcohol could be felt lerking in the background all the time. The hops also come into play, along with a peat fire type of infusion.

Dark fruit aroma, molasses, spice, a bit of chocolate. Good amount of hops balance the malt out perfectly and add a super-pleasant crisp english-style bitterness that works perfectly. It¬ís an old ale that IPA-lovers will appreciate. Great palate - lighter, crisp carbonation, not syrupy or oily at all (some appreciated dryness actually).

Ar- This is a very well toasted and even slightly roasted malty beer treat. The aromas of caramel, toffee via with a hint of almost cocoa notes. The hops kick up a floral notes for me. The alcohol is definately in the nose. Perhaps I am just wishing but this beer smells like a bourbon treatment would be supreme. 

Ap- The body of the beer is coppery red coloration. The head is a thin coppery tinged biege coloration. The head resolves quickly but lots of foam marks the beers rapid passage from my glass.

T- Very nice pine infused toasted nutty caramel malty treat. The alcohol is a bit hot in the flavor but I am liking it. Again tempted to give this a tiny bourbon hit. 

P- The body of the beer is full and the carbonation level is low but works well with the beers character. The alcohol is a bit hot and brings the palate down from a 4. I am wondering what a few months to a year would do to this beer?

O- The enjoyment factor is high for this malty treat. If the alcohol was tamed a little this beer would be a big treat. I am curious enough to get a sixer and set back for a cellar nap.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AverageMan"

It is strong, dark but not roasty like a stout or porter and the malts are pushed up in front of the hops. It¬ís color is a nice, deep read, almost purple. The head fades quickly but does leave a few spots of lace. A rum raisin sweetness dominates the nose, along w/ some toasted biscuity malts. Flavor is rather more dry than you¬íd expect from the nose, which lends drinkability. Still, this beer is hefty and thick w/ very mild carbonation. It¬ís a bit boozy which works in this case.

Nose: oh how I love English style Barleywines and old ales¬Ö melted chocolate and fudge; like walking into a chocolate shop where the air is thoroughly permeated with all the goodness inside. Vanilla flitters to and fro. Dark fruits are a faint whisper in the back along with some black cherries. Chocolate dominates, joining the dark fruits for some chocolate covered dates and figs, dried please.

Palate: first quaff and I am right back in chocolate heaven. Burnt essence underneath with the dryness of charred wood and burnt black chocolates. Marshmallows roast while the top of my tongue has a light dry chalkiness to it; dry old ash. Wood lingers along the side of my tongue. Raisins, prunes, cherry stones all lurk underneath for a sturdy pedestal upon which all things chocolate stand. Little to no spice, though warmth does slowly curl her fingers around my chest.

3674,"2010-11-03",3.7,"This 12 oz bottle of the 2010 vintage (no cellaring) poured a deep red into my snifter, raising a one-finger head that seemed substantial for an old ale. This, along with the lacing that followed, suggested that this was not a typical ""drinks like a meal"" barleywine-ish ale. The nose bore this out, with distinct hop notes weaving their way among the expected molasses and cigar aromas. The flavor followed suit, leaving an overall effect halfway between an old ale and some of the American Strong Ales such as Red Rocket or Yakima Twilight. Due to its similarity to those ASAs, this is more of a drinker than a sipper. In other words, it is pretty close to the perfect old ale for someone like me who isn¬ít always crazy about the style.","Athens, Georgia, USA","bjt512"

Clear reddish brown with a small off-white head that leaves a ring of lacings.

The smell is very malty with pleasant hoppy undertones. Notes of caramel, sweet fruits, powdered chocolate and rye bread.

The flavor is sweet and malty. Rich caramel flavors, chocolate and toffee. Perhaps a toasty note and a hint of coffee. Very muted hop aromas. The finish is warming with a touch of alcohol, rye bread and some bitterness. The taste gets blurry and too sweet after a while in the glass.

Mouthfeel is rich and creamy. Full bodied but really smooth. A touch of alcohol warmth on the finish.

3674,"2009-11-29",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2012 It poured a very dark golden liquid with a small beige foam that left a nice lacing.

It had a very malty smell, similar to how it smells when you open a bag of freshly ground malts just before a brewing.

It had a smooth mouthfeel with a thick body. It had a very malty taste, just like voert before you boil it. Very sweet rich malty flavour. It had some alcoholic warmth but no real alcohol taste.

It isn¬ít very christmasy but I really enjoyed it. I¬íve never actually tried a beer that was this malty before.","√ñrebro, SWEDEN","olsvammel"
3674,"2009-11-27",4.0,"It has a sweet but potent aroma up front. The brew pours with a medium frothy head and has a beautiful dark chestnut color. It tastes like a strong ale for sure - rife packing a punch to you with some maltiness and vague hops for a nice balance.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"

Short head if given a little time to warm. Still, the nose is expressive. Really malty with a hint of hops. Caramel, soy, dark chocolate, slightly doughy and a tinge barnyard. The hops are floral and green. Quite complex. Medium+ body, prickly carbonation, s-thicky texure. Ultra-long sticky bitter and roasty finish. Some oil and alcohol is present. Nice. Let this warm some.","Portland, Oregon, USA","cmonster"
3674,"2009-11-25",3.8,"Pours a clear dark ruby copper brown with beige head.  Aroma is resiny hops, some fruit, chocolate and carmel.   Taste starts with sweet malt - caramel, chocolate, toasty - changing to citrusy fruit and finishing with piney bitterness.  Average carbonation and a lighter body than you¬íd expect from the flavor and abv.  Quite flavorful and drinkable.  I¬íd probably like it even more with a bit more age on it (bottled Nov. 5, tasted Nov. 25).","Washington, USA","Totochtin"

3674,"2009-11-24",3.3,"355 ml bottle, courtesy of Cardinal Pub & Bar, Stavanger. ABV is 8.7%. Beautiful clear and deep copper to mahogany coloured beer, big off-white to beige head. Strong malty aroma with distinct notes of caramel and bakery. The flavour has loads of malty sweetness and caramel, maybe too much caramel for my taste. Noticeable hoppy bitterness in the finish, also notes of burnt bread crumbs. Not entirely balanced in my book, but an interesting beer all the same.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"
3674,"2009-11-22",4.6,"I anticipate this beer every year.  This is one of the best yet.  Higher ABV makes this a real bang for the buck.  Very roasty and malty for an old ale, but nonetheless perfect.  Hops mingle in and out to try and tame the malt. Can¬ít wait to try this one in a year or two.  A must have for beer lovers of all types.","cleveland, Ohio, USA","beeratarian"
3674,"2009-11-22",3.4,"Location: 12 oz bottle from Gilly¬ís, 11/22/09 (2009 Bottle, 8.7%)


Aroma: Aroma of caramel, bread, nuts, brown sugar, toffee, dark fruits, light alcohol, light smoke, light earth

Appearance: Pours a clear ruby-brown color with a thin off-white head, light lace

Flavor: Taste is medium sweet and highly malty, similar to the notes that exist in the nose

Palate: Medium-soft carbonation, medium-full body, an interesting mouthfeel

Overall Impression: 
This makes for a pretty good beer.  A nice old ale with some interesting flavors and characteristics.  Another good brew from Great Divide, I¬ím glad to see these guys are becoming more available around here, as they make some quality stuff.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

3674,"2009-11-18",4.3,"Poured from bottle into Snifter.

Relatively dark reddish-brown that glows ruby red in the light. Minimal head but leaves light lacing lines.

Aroma of brown sugar, toffee, cherry, dark fruit, English hop spiciness and alcohol; the English hops become more apparent as it sits in the glass.

Complex malt profile that seems both sweet and dry at the same time. Hard for me to separate the individual flavors, but cherry and caramelized sugars appear to be in the mix, with notes of bitter chocolate, peat and a stale mustiness. The English hop spiciness/bitterness is apparent throughout, especially at the finish. However, it does grow more malty and deep as it warms.

Low carbonation, full body, with a mostly dry (and warming) finish.

Very nice example of an Old Ale which begs to be sipped. However, I feel like I enjoyed it a little more less year when it was a little lower in alcohol and the malts seemed to be richer in comparison to the spicy hops. Not sure if the beer or my palate is different. Either way, still a great beer.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"
3674,"2009-11-17",4.3,"Dark ruby tinged amber liquid. Decent head which has good retention and some pretty good lacing.

Big, dark roasted coffee hits first. Strong, sweet maltiness follows. Hints of chocolate ice cream. Slight vanilla caramel notes. Good dark fruit presence. Tobacco notes.
Nose is quite complex and inviting.

Like a chocolate coffee malt. Hefty roasted malt backbone. Sweet caramel/brown sugar notes. Hints of espresso. Nice dark fruit presence, here. Good yeast presence. Slight oakiness.

Very nice and silky smooth. Great carbonation level.

Tasty, tasty, and quite drinkable. Many more of these shall be consumed, now that they are readily available to me.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","coldmeat23"

3674,"2009-11-13",3.0,"Tasted blind.  Pretty copper/ruby body, reasonable off-white head.  Nose is dusty chocolate, not quite grapes, not quite raisins.  Rich caramel maltiness.

3674,"2009-11-08",3.9,"Aroma  is very big on malt. Similar to a scotch ale, with lots of oak and smokiness. No real presence of hops.

Pours a 2 finger tan head, body is dark brown. Head retention and lacing are barely above average

Flavor  is similar to the smell but better. The smoke comes out more and there is a bit of vanilla which could pass as the oak aged version. There is an aftertaste of warming alcohol that isnt too overpowering but is nice for this style. Hops come in and out and balance nicely with the sweetness of the malt

Mouth feel is good. Carbonation is a bit on the aggressive side but body has some substance to balance things. 

Overall it is pretty good. For such a high abv beer its somewhat session able. Great beer for cold nights, definitely a malt bomb, sweet, smoky, and just enough bitterness. Another very good beer from Great Divide.","Colorado, USA","Angelmonster"

Pours a really nice deep copper with a huge billowy beige head that shows excellent retention and lacing.  Really good looking beer here.

The aroma is very sweet with lots of caramel malts and toffee.  Some brown sugar and dark fruits mix in as well as a hint of chocolate.

The taste is excellent with the typical old ale tastes coming out, namely caramel malts, toffee and dark fruit.  But there is also plenty of chocolate and brown sugar, and maybe some hops though I think they¬íve probably faded over the last year.

The mouthfeel is pretty full bodied for the style with good soft carbonation.  Sticky sweet overall feel.

Sometimes people go too sweet and cloying with this style but GD is getting it right! Finishes really clean with a perfect level of bitter on the back of the mouth. The 8.7% ABV is very well hidden and you could easily get yourself in trouble with this one if you start pounding too fast.

3674,"2009-09-01",4.3,"I have been cellaring this beer for a year now all because of the aged sample I had at last year¬ís GABF. The first sniff at the bottle is candied chocolate. The beer is so dark red in color it is almost brown but when held to the light it reveals itself. Nice, pillowy, khaki-colored head. The smell holds true with a sweet, full chocolate, tootsie roll and candy aroma, with slight alcohol fumes in the back; it smells fantastic! The taste is malty, cocoa powder but does not quite match the smell, which is good in my opinion. The alcohol is hiding and the mouthfeel is neither thick nor thin. I am still undecided as to whether or not I should buy more for cellaring this year since I still have several 2006 bottles. This is a very malty beer and good for a cold day such as today. I¬ím surprised this is not in bombers or four packs but I am not going to complain because a sixer for $8 is a very good value. Drinkability suffers a little as I did not want another.

3674,"2009-02-16",3.6,"12 oz bottle enjoyed while catching up with all my ratings from my amazing ""Birthday Weekend"" (Feb 14th) planned by my wonderful girlfriend. After a long day of cleaning, cellaring all of my haul from Wisco, and getting errands done, I found this at the back of the fridge. 12 oz. bottle from the Binny¬ís Singles Rack (Orland Park, IL). Pours an iced tea reddish copper with big tannish bubbly head that begins to dissipate. Aromas are brown sugar and molasses, some light chocolate, tobacco, nuttiness, and some light booziness. The aroma reminds me of a nice desserty bread or cake. Initial is heavy on malts as some bitterness comes in on the end. Brown sugar and cakey biscuity malts come in strong with a touch of caramel, chocolate, and coffee evident. Alcohol is well hidden, as it smelled stronger than it tasted. Smooth. Good body, but nothing overly heavy or hard to quaff. Head dissipates down to a small layer, and the bitterness starts to come in fuller. Very malty, but I was not dissappointed. I just personally have a hard time loving ASAs. Still, a very nice brew.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

3674,"2009-02-14",3.7,"Bottle into red wine glass.

Pours a dark reddish brown, murky, with a thin, soapy off-white head.

Nose is loaded with cocoa mixed with a caramel sweetness. Fruity esthers and some boozey alcohol almost run wild. Nice nose, very intense, but very new too. Put a little age on this one to refine it a bit and I think it¬íd take it to a whole new level.

Taste has lots of cocoa, a bit of brown sugar, and a leafy hop presence - almost vegetal. Seriously, it¬ís like someone chucked in a dry leaf towards the finish. Some warming alcohol on the finish.

As the beer warmed from cellar to room temperature, the leafy hop presence receded and left an earthy bitterness instead. Still a bit leafy, green, vegetal, but no longer dominatingly so. Much more palatable, though this is still a beer that would come into its own with some time in the cellar.

Mouthfeel is fluffy, a bit creamy, lively, and a bit syrupy.

I could pick out some characteristics that were similar to a bock though... some light chocolate hints with nut and dark fruit. I was very surprised by this ale...

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, dark, brownish amber to mahogany with an average, off-white head that kept a thin sheet and left fair lacing. The aroma was light to moderate caramel, light to moderate citrus hops, raisin, prune, maple syrup, vanilla, alcohol, dark fruit and when cooler a little chocolate. The flavor started sweet and a little bitter, and finished acidic and a little bitter with a long duration. There was slight chocolate, caramel malt, maple syrup, citrus hops, alcohol, and at the very end pine hops.

ABV, Volume & Calories: 8.1 % in 12 fl oz. estimated at 200 C
Purchased at: Canal¬ís Lawrenceville, NJ for $1.83

Aroma: caramel, syrup and roasted malts. Some pepper, spice, and citrus.

Visuals: Beautiful packaging, recently redesigned cohesive brand from Great Divide.  It does the beer within the bottles justice. The ruby mahogany body is deep and contemplative. hard to see through, but clear rather than hazy. Thin tan head is long lasting, lace is intricate and shows this brew¬ís freshness.

Taste: Well balanced flavor starts with roasted malt, follows with a rush of crispness from carbonation, and finishes long with a dark roasty deliciousness. Sugar overtones, followed quickly by a light sourness. Easily drinkable. Alcohol is quiet and well hidden.

Palate:  Smooth, crisp, drying, and long fantastic finish add up to a wonderful session brew, despite the high ABV, so beware!

Overall: A beautiful, enticing, delicious beer, affordable, from a great brewer, and entices the senses. I¬íll have it again, for sure.

Really quite dry,  chalky coca powder, nutmeg, lightly caramelized malts, a touch of roasted malts, some woodiness, and a nice laid-back piney hop bite.  Super smooth and soft, the flavors are so well in-tune with each other while completely disguising the alcohol.  Quick chocolate nutmeg finish.  This is fantastic.  Another example of how a beer¬ís sum can be greater than its parts in this relatively simple beer.  I don¬ít see this getting any better with age, its flavors are already pretty mellowed and the strong hops add greatly to gentle malts.

There is milk chocolate, malt and some light brown sugar to begin.  This transitions into more fruity character and hops, nhounderpinned by delicious woody flavors.

Toffee, brown sugar, hop and caramel and christmas pudding dance around to the beat laid down by the grassy/hay-like hops. A very light touch of cardboard that doesn¬ít seem wrong. A very nicely balanced aroma. The balance in flavors is a little skewed towards the hops but by no means off kilter. Dark roasted cocoa beans, big malt, and a big grassy hop kick.

3674,"2008-01-15",3.6,"12 oz. bottle - 2007 vintage.  Aroma is full of roasted malt, chocolate, toffee sweetness, and slight tinge of EtOH.  Pours a solidly deep brown, close to mahogany, with 2-3 fingers of creamy tan crown, decent retention and some fingery lacing.  Flavour has a huge malt backbone, lots of burnt and roasted goodness, with a prominent hop bitterness arising through the taste.  There is also a spice complex that causes a very pleasant and smooth finish, lots of cinnamon, mace, and nutmeg.  It is medium-bodied with low-to-moderate carbonation, the perfect amount of effervescence to allow the spice notes to come through.  An EtOH warming comes up the throat after the taste as finished, enhancing the spice aftertaste - quite pleasant, especially for a winter beer.  Overall a fantastic beer, very drinkable.  The flavour isn¬ít very complex - very straightforward but this is a case where simpler is better.  I can¬ít wait to cellar a few bottles of this and taste it next year and the year after that.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","marksahara"

3674,"2007-12-08",4.0,"12 ounce bottle.  Hibernation Ale easily makes it onto my list of favorite ales.  First, it is beautiful to look at.  It has a rich, ruby color.  It has a frothy, off-white head that stays around for quite some time and leaves intricate lacing in its wake.  The body is clear and sparkles with excellent carbonation.  Drinking it in the Trappist glass suggested by RateBeer.com seems to greatly highlight its visual attributes.

The aroma is of heavy malts, with molasses at the forefront.  Dark fruits of plum, prune, and a hint of cherry are also present, as well as a spiciness.  The flavor follows suit.  It is a well-balanced blend of malts and hops, sweet and bitter, although there is a presence of slightly too much alcohol and a slight burnt wood flavor that are the only faults.  But, the spices, which I cannot quite place help to alleviate some of that harshness.  The body is good in the mouth and on the tongue.  A nice warming quality is bolstered by the vibrant carbonation.  I would have to agree with others that this would be a good candidate for the beer cellar.  Another year or two would diminish some of the minor alcohol and burnt wood imperfections and make the rest of the great flavors really shine.","Washington, USA","troysworktable"

On the palate, the biscuit malt explodes with roasty undertones, fruity alcohol warmth, finishing towards a more understated minty hop resin than I remember it being.  Initially syrupy on the palate, it clears almost too well, leaving only the faint mintiness and rather strong yeast dryness.  Has definitely mellowed over the past year, quite beneficially, as the hops are pleasantly present but the rich chewy malts dominate the profile.  A pretty good example of the underrepresented style of Old Ales in America.","USA","ElGaucho56"

I get a bit of fruit off the aroma; first impression is that it bears considerable resemblance to Victory Old Horizontal or one of Dogfish Head¬ís barlewines (Immort Ale and/or Olde School).  Not as rich and thick in body or flavor, though.  Maybe more like North Coast Old Stock Ale (also 3.5) with a bit of added spiciness.

Thanks to Tom (CaptainCougar) for sending this as a bonus in a trade a few months ago.  It was really good even though for some reason I was thinking it would be a barleywine.  For a two year old beer it has held up well and I imagine it could take another year or two without any problems.  I¬ím unlikely to pick up another bottle simply due to the sheer volume of other things in my queue but if you get the chance to try this it is worthwhile.
Aroma / Appearance - The flat deep brown body had a very short lived head and minimal carbonation.  The nose was caramel, black cherries, cooled sun tea and black licorice.  There were some hops evident but they were old from age.  As it oxidizes the nose begins to lighten up.
Flavor / Palate - Chewy toffee, molasses and alcohol are succeeded by a dry papery aftertaste.  For an 8% ABV beer it was very drinkable.  The middle of the bottle reminded me of carbonated iced tea with a handful of pop rocks tossed in for extra measure.  The finish was bitter and lingered on the back of the throat.  This isn¬ít too bad though I would like to have compared a fresh bottle to see how it has aged.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

2006 Bottling
Poured with a very dark red body that I¬ím unable to see through. A 1-finger head formed briefly before falling to a creamy swirl of a cap. When held to the light the body turns firey red with clumps of slowly rising carbonation bubbles. Looks flavor packed. It¬ís tempting me.

The smell comes through with big caramel. As a matter of fact it brings to mind caramel apples. Theres some mustiness and dampness that compliments things nicely. Hops come through at the finish but are mild. Pine needles and a splash of citrus.As it warms it takes on a boozy character.

The taste is deep and rich. Like a winter seasonal should be. The big caramel carries over from the smell and is balanced nicely with a solid citrus hoppy goodness.There¬ís toasted grain coming through mid-palate and a faint hit of the mustiness. A spicy alcohol character finishes things off on the swallow. As this beer warms the flavors get more complex. I don¬ít get much hop bitterness but I can sense my tongue going a little numb. That¬ís pretty unique. Nicely done.

Mouthfeel is good for a high abv beer. Medium bodied with mild carbonation so the beer just makes its way slowly over the tongue. Theres a nice creaminess for the body. It¬ís in no way viscous like a lot of other beers of this strength are. The alcohol gives a nice warmth, especially as this beer warms.

The drinkability is good for a stronger beer. The body has a lot to do with this. I don¬ít think it would be so easy going down during the summer months but when it¬ís cold out Hibernation is hard to beat.

Overall this is one of my preferred winter seasonals. I try and have it on hand if I spot it around here. Very well made beer and something to look forward to every winter. The next step for me will be aging some for next winter.

Too often the strong ales can¬ít cover the amount of alky present. Pours ruby brown transparent red in my steeler stein.  Very little brown head that fades rapidly.  Has a rather sweet aroma in the background that is typical of a strong ale. Nice stream of carbonation each time you take a sip.  The flavor is overwhelming with alcohol.  Like most beers with a high alky content it is a bit ruff and unrefined. Carbonation on the tongue is below average and this stuff leaves a lasting bitterness on the palate that just will not go away.  You know you were drinking something offensive when you down this brew. I¬ím not sure how somebody could rate this so high and then turn around and slam the average cheap american malt liquor, they fall in the same flavor class.  Will not buy again, way too much for my girlie taste buds. Bitter beer lover probably think this is great stuff.  Finish is lingering astringent and medicine like.

Pours a dark red-tinged brown with a one finger tan head, that slowly recedes to a thick cap. The subsequent lacing is thick, completely coating the inside of the glass.

Smell; at first the aroma starts out with coffee and a little bit of piney hops. Then it becomes chocolate, mixed with spices and fruits. This is one beer I could just sit as smell for a long time, very nice.

Taste; as with the smell, the flavor starts out with coffee and then turns to chocolate covered, rum soaked cherries.

Chocolate is evident, as is floral to herbal hops and caramel, somewhat.  Toasty.  This is full in the mouth, creamy, with nice viscosity.  Really rough going down.  Not a smooth beer by any stretch.  Not bad in and of itself, but I feel like there are too many strong flavors in this and they aren¬ít complementary.  Big rich sweet complex malt, everything from chocolate and caramel and toasty roast.  The alcohol is enormous here too.  This is a beer that drinks like a poorly constructed 8.1 ABV drink, I¬íve had beers with nearly double the ABV where the alcohol was less noticable.  Big hops too.  Floral, grapefruit, and resin all really present.  Not a terribly clean beer.  Chocolate finish with alcohol and vanilla cream.  The aftertaste is overpowered with alcohol and dominated by brash hops and roasted malt.  I just didn¬ít care for this beer too much overall.

I had know problem pouring the first half vigorously enough to gurgle it, making sure that I had 1-1.5 inches of thick foamy head.  Aroma in this fresh bottle is much different than when I had my last bottle in July.  Very hoppy: lots of grass, herb and vegetable qualities, like this beer was plucked fresh from the garden.  Underneath that, some mild plum, and caramel notes.  Tastes smacks you kindly with some toast, caramel, toffee and roast elements all at once.  There¬ís still that pervasive veggie-hop flavor to it as well.  Finishes roasty, and pleasently bitter, almost smokey.  I can still breath that hoppy taste, which I know will disappear from this beer by July.  I¬íve always loved this beer.

3674,"2006-11-08",3.1,"New seasonal intake at the Systembolaget in Sweden

Appearance: Chestnut brown with appealing tan marshmellow head that lasted.

Aroma: Wow there¬ís a lot going on here. Definate liquorice, roasted malt, wonderful floral hops and caramalised sugar. Brown Ale meets American IPA.

Flavour: And here¬ís where it started to go wrong for me. A very chewy malt backbone to this beer, unfortunately complemented by a beef stock cube/meaty flavour I found hard to deal with. Would be a good beer to marinade meat for a BBQ.

Palate: Strangely soft, with a kiss (alright, more like a snog) of alcohol and slightly oily from the malt. Tounge-curly hop at the end, but it¬ís the whiskyish residual alcohol heat that marks this beer down for me.

Overall: A complex and powerful beer, but not one I¬ím going to rush back to. As refreshing as a run up stairs, and the lingering raw spirit taste is a turn-off for me.

The taste is a bit acrid and I wonder if it¬ís because the beer is Ice cold. Me thinks this beer would taste a lot more bodied and less Hopfensive if it were a bit warmer, but none-the-les, a developed ber with strong malts, masked alcohol and a ripping hop sense.

3674,"2006-01-18",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 17, 2007 When it comes to winter warmers, not much takes precedent over Great Divide¬ís cautiously sweet Hibernation Ale.  This winter marked the first set of cold months since I hurdled over the 21 years age requirement, so I was looking forward to finding a good belly warmer and settling with it for the cold days to come.  What I found was neither a normal stout, or a disappointingly thin ¬ìwinter ale¬î.  At last, a winter seasonal apposite to a blizzarding day!  Only one other beer I had through November and December contends with Hibernation Ale (that being Hitachino New Year¬ís Ale).  The clear but furious glowing coal red colored ale floats beneath a dark custard head, intimating the details of the taste with a tempting smell of roasted malts and chocolate without the cloying bitter qualities.  The taste is surprisingly sweet; enough to satiate my youthful palate but not so light that it doesn¬ít kindle a glowing warmth in my stomach.  Also, the 8.1% ABV makes me a bit drowsy, so I¬ím prepared to settle into a deep chair for a brief respite from waking, cold hours.  Alongside the comforting textures and taste I can understand why they call this Hibernation Ale; a hearty beer with an alluring taste and a soporific finish.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

One of the more complex aromas I have had the privledge to enjoy. Texture is slightly chewy. Flavor is chocolate, caramel, heavily toasted, roast, even woody. There are some hops in the end, but the sweet malts balance it very well. No bitterness in this one. Decently carbonated. Bought one 12oz for $1.59 to try. I feel cheated I didn¬ít buy more of this gem.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","eboats"
3674,"2005-12-11",4.0,"2005 bottle. An attractive deep burgundy-amber color with a dense, frothy head. Nose was a bit subtle, but aromas of caramel, toasted malt, wood, chocolate and faint hops were present. Full, chewy mouthfeel with a smooth restrained carbonation level. Initial flavors of dark dried fruits, nuts, roasted malts and a pleasant musty earthiness prevail.  Alcohol warms things up nicely combined with a moderate hop bitterness to finish things off. Gotta enjoy this one in the cellar temp ranges of 55-60* to really get the full enjoyment. Another tasty offering from GD.  A super Winter Warmer.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

3674,"2005-12-03",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 4, 2005 Pours with a frothy amber-tan colored head that is a finger and a half thick.  The beer is a deep amber color that shows a brilliantly clear deep ruby color when held up to the light.  The aroma is quite malty with notes of caramel and toffee up front moving to a dry lightly roasted note and a bit of burnt grain astringency.  The finish reminds me of toasty brown ale.  Perhaps there is a bit of cherry like fruit character as well, but this is fairly subdued.

The beer has a medium full heft to it, but does not really coat the mouth to much.  The beer is lightly sweet with notes of toffee and a light molasses.  The finish is a mix of toasted malt notes, a bit of coffee, and a roast grain character that also includes a hint of burnt grain astringency.  There is a combination of flavors that make me think of Rum; a combination of the sweet malt notes and the slight alcohol heat in the finish.

This beer is actually quite nice, not very many breweries do a English style Old Ales.  The malt character is refreshingly unhoppy, and makes for a great sipping beer.  This will age pretty well, and I think I will have to pick up a couple bottles for next years holiday season.

The body was clear, and the head creamy, one finger thick, and beige in color, and lots of lace, too. The earthy sweet aroma was that of chocolate, hazelnuts, and toffee, all standard fare for a Strong or Old Ale. The taste was sweet and mellow, with a brown sugar and vanilla flavor up front, a hint of mocha, which was followed by a nutty character. The hops were more noticeable with the classic Great Divide flair, and added an extra layer of citric and leafy complexity.

Taste has length with a long dark malt detainment of indifferent blackenedness. Caramel smooth underneath. Slight roast and heat attached sweetness trailing on and on to where smidgeons, as the aroma eluded to, of chocolate, plum, and cherry play its small part. Dark and peculiar. Bitterness holds off til late with a leafy roasted hop sap. Orange laced acids feather at the tonsils. It has a broad range of length, substantially so, but a bigger energy and character was needed to boost it to the next level of greatness for me. 

Perhaps here is where the problem lies as its body is a bit low and not as full or bold as I thought it was gonna be based off its aroma. A somewhat weaker medium body makes it seem solitary and conserved. Carbonation is nice. Solid smoothness with just the right amount of give for the style, aptly rough enough in areas, and the right amount of hints to the alcohol. One nice aspect of the Hibernation is its gradual warming feel that slips across your memory as you decide to open another. That, I liked.

So, as it goes, this brew is not fully impressionable but has that satisfyingly casual appeal that makes for a nice experience and keeps a favorably easy drinkability to its disposition worthy of Great Divides¬í reputation.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Flavor was very sweet of caramel hops and dried fruits (cherry?) and minimal hop flavor though the bitterness was quite pronounced.  I¬íve found this true of most American strong ales: lots of bitterness but little hop flavor.  Mouthfeel was full bodied and thick and smooth but a tad bit overcarbonated.

3674,"2004-11-15",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 28, 2005 RERATE 11/28/05: The 2005 version of this beer is even better than last year¬ís.  There¬ís more depth to the brew and I¬ím getting more rich chocolate and toffee tastes.  The palate is also more full.  Great Divide deserves a compliment for improving an already good beer. 

Watch out, this stuff will ""gitcha"".  Aroma is complex with plenty of nuttiness.  Pours a cloudy dark brown with reddish tint.  Nice, long-lasting tan head.  Big malt in the initial taste followed by aromatic spiciness & fruitiness.  There¬ís an alcoholic tang in the background.  Some nice spicy hops in the finish.  Not a weak-kneed beer by any means.

Big dark yellow head.  Bottle conditioned.  Aroma was so good, I couldnt even wait until the beer warmed before trying it.  Smells of spices, but mainly from hops and yeast, with some lighter sweet malts.  Flavor is big with some cherry and other ripe fruit flavors, english style yeast and hops.  Woody oak flavors meet crisp hops and plenty of nice english toffee and light chocolate.  Very complex, approaching the grandeur of the Fullers Vintage line.  Only setback was a slightly acidic astringency on the finish which seems to be found in most of these American ESAs.  However, here it is much less apparent.  Body is slightly less full and flavors are not as deep as Fullers Vintage Ales, but the fact that this beer actually comes close is impressive.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Hints of wood and a light caramel sweetness, sherry notes, roastiness, and fruitiness as it warms.  Odd, but there's a sharp acidic sourness in the initial sip, as well a malty sweetness and hop flavor.  It is well balanced and has chocolate malt up front and gets a little sweeter as it warms, but that sourness just won't go away. Fruitiness creeps into the finish and has a hop aftertaste.  Sourness is still there!  Medium fuller body with low carbonation with an acidic bite on the tongue which I just don't get; alcohol is hidden very well.  There's a light astringency, but it should mellow with some aging.  I'm not quite sure where that sourness is coming from.  It's not a dark grain sourness, it's more like a lactic acid sourness that just doesn't belong.  It takes away from an otherwise seemingly good beer.  I've also had this one last year...didn't rate it...but I don't remember the sourness.  I'll chalk this up to a bad bottle since I seem to be in the minority here and I'll re rate at a later time and bottle.","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","kujo9"

A hint of fusel alcohol, a bit of bubble gum, sweet malt, caramel, fresh and inviting, a real pleasure to sniff this one, start is sweet malt, the top middling in feel. Finish is perky in its acidity, the hops straight forward in their spicy bite, dry and a real treat. A bit of alcohol warming as it hits the tummy, a fine beer at any rate.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

3674,"2003-03-20",3.1,"Strong and acrid aroma.  Floral hints also lead out.  Very bitter and sweet beer.  Beautiful dark ruby color with a nice head.  Not my favorite barley wine, but a memorable one for the power and tang of the flavor.","Westerville, Ohio, USA","Panzuriel"

3674,"2003-02-27",2.6,"I opened it, I poured it, I brought the glass to my nose, I sipped it. and .....big deal.  Ended up power chugging this one.  I'm sure my rating will suck as compared to the average but who cares.  I'm glad I had only one to drink because well I really didn't want to have to think of finishing the remaining five.  If your still reading at this point, here is what my final thoughts are.  Don't waste your time with this one, not as bold and assertive as the caption on the bottle says.","Sharon, Wisconsin, USA","awaller05"
3674,"2003-02-05",4.0,"Hibernation reminds me of 3 Floyds Behemoth(which I think I need to rerate down).  It is not as syrupy as Behemoth.  It has a nice balance of malty sweetness and hops bitterness.  Alcohol is not noticeable.  Pours a little cloudy.  Aroma of hops. Great Barley.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"

3674,"2003-01-02",3.9,"I thought this was going to be a honey flavored ale due to the big yellow script on the label.  I was very surprised when my first sip was packed with grainy malts and a big fistfull of hops!!!!  This is a fine ale that also has a bit more alcohol than it hints of.  Nicely complex for a beer that I decided to gulp down right out of the bottle!  2002 version.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
3674,"2003-01-02",4.2,"aah, at last, a huge winter beer capable of warming even my stoney and jaded palate (i¬íve tasted too few of the highest rated ones and a spate of the wimpish wannabes).  decants a deep rosy amber like red x-mas lights seen through the squinted eyes of a beautiful beer buzz; tresses of silky foam. aroma of very lightly scorched wood and brown sugar made incendiary with plenty of alcohol.  taste of bourbon malts, lightly smoky, allowing only a bread-like sweetness.  ultra-soft bristles of carbonation airlift spruce cone hoppiness way to the back.  this gorgeous beer kissed me like she meant it--at midnight, 2003.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

3674,"2002-12-12",3.2,"A beer that doesn¬ít know what it wants to be.  I think you could classify this one a number of ways.  First observation, both in color and flavors, is the dark, very malty tenor of it all.  Aroma definitely of an English strong ale, as promised, then roasted flavors, sticky sweet, passing into the hoppy phase, the grapefruit phase, the warming strong ale phase, then the IPA bitter phase.  All over the map.  It¬ís good, especially the malts, but it leaves me unsettled.  Some nice parts, but I can¬ít stomach sweet sour bitterness.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
3674,"2002-12-09",4.1,"Rerate:  This got a bit better after sitting in stores for a couple months.  Much smoother with spices and hints of spruce and pine.

3674,"2002-12-08",4.0,"A great beer from a very good brewer. Pours like mollasess. Thick rocky head. Hoppy in the 60 IBU area. Very pronounced. Abv is perfecrt; while not absent it does not dominate. Very malty with a due amount of sweetness. A great warmer.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","erway"

It has the smell and crispness of a pale ale, but has interesting hints of chocolate in the flavor.  Not all that complex but still interesting and tasty.  I rather enjoyed my bottle.","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"
3674,"2002-11-19",3.6,"One of the better warmers of the year so far - if not for the grapfruity aspect that ecrvich spoke of, this one would be over 4.0.","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"

3674,"2002-11-04",2.5,"UPDATED: DEC 13, 2014 Bottle (Nov 17, 2014 batch). Head is initially small, frothy, light brown, fully diminishing. Body is dark amber to medium brown. Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, cookie), lightly to moderately hoppy (resin, grapefruit), with a note of brown sugar, hint of shrimp paste. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter, slightly unclean. Medium to full body, syrupy texture, soft carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.

A very simplistic, overly syrupy rendition. Aroma is kind of dull and pretty much just sugars (strange rotted fish odor way in the background too).  Mouthfeel is weird, very thick and syrupy-sticky, hard to enjoy.  Extremely sweet without much to balance, again making it very hard to drink much. Surprisingly bad for this brewery.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

3674,"2002-10-28",4.0,"2002 - deeep dark ruby red color.  nice head and lacing.  Thick body - it even looked like the bubbles had a hard time rising to the top.  At first taste, it seemed a bit overly ""fruity"" - raison/berry flavors.  Improved and mellowed as it warmed - some dark chocolate.  mostly dry finish.  Had a few and the higher alc % started kickin in.....sneaky.","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
3674,"2002-09-12",4.1,"Nice one here.  ¬í99 sample. Some fruit tones in the nose along with some brown sugar.  This has pretty good body that is a bit covered up with a high level of carbonation. Not what I¬íd describe as a ¬íhoppy¬í beer but there is an enjoyable bitterness on the back end of this that tells you to slow down, sit back and savour this. Nicely balanced. I will be adding this to my ¬íwinter brew¬í list.","Michigan, USA","softale"
3674,"2002-08-14",4.5,"Excellent. Pours out to a dark brown with a tan head. Initial smell is that of plums. Taste is malty and rich with enough alcohol present to let you know its there, but blended in well. A fine winter-style offering that was enjoyed on an August night.

3674,"2002-06-28",3.6,"Malty, strong, with a bit of bittersweet chocolate in there.  Hoppy finish, but not too much so.  It tasted like several beers mixed together, actually, and doesn¬ít really even imitate the other English strong ales I¬íve tried, which is a good thing for the most part.  Quite roasty, toasty malt compliments the rest of the tastes and produces a very good beer.  I didn¬ít realize this was 8.1 percent ABV, so it must have been well-hidden.  A nice brew!","Sherman, Texas, USA","unixweb"

A month or two ago this would have been fine fireside, nodding ale - now its lively alcohol presence and malty power announce an end to Hibernation.  Love the ominous rumble of the closing hops!
