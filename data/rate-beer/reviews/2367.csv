2367,"2017-05-24",4.0,"Bottle to becher pint glass, the appearance was a ruddy burnt amber color with a minimal white foamy head that fell off at a slow pace. Some stringy lace.
The aroma had a clean smooth sweet caramel/toffee malt base rolling over some citrusy sweet and bitter hops. Light earthiness and a little bit of roasted to sweet nuts amplify the overall enjoyment of the nose.
The flavor had the sweetness up front of the prior mentioned aromas to collide with the roastiness and a subtle herbal to floral smooth sweet contour. Aftertaste mixed the caramel/toffee malts with the hops pretty nice. Finish was clean, smooth and sweet.
The palate was medium bodied with a pretty good sessionability about it. Carbonation and ABV felt as projected by the brewer.
Overall, pretty damn nice beer by not a cheap brewery, but hey the second bottle I was able to get of this I had with a grilled bacon and parmesan cheese sandwich and well, I have to admit, that was one hell of a pairing!","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Pours deep copper to red. Little to no head but some carbonation evident while drinking.

Aroma is very pleasant. Just a medium hop smell.

Taste is about what you'd expect, and as described. Citrus-y hops and caramel-y malt. You get some oak-y vanilla from the 25% aged part but nothing overwhelming or any obvious alcohol burn. Pretty consistent taste all the way through the drink. Hops without being overbearing. 

Not very much like other Bruery's I've had but pretty tasty.



Palate is basically light.

2367,"2014-02-19",3.3,"On cask @ The Bruery. Clear amber pour with a finger of off-white head. Really nutty, bready malt nose. Some light fruit esters, floral hops, earth, and tea. Slight herbaceous quality and orange oil. Flavor is pleasantly sweet with lots of caramel and toasted bread. Bitter finish of tea, woody herbs, and chalk. Theres a hint of citrus and lots of earthy hops. Earlier Rating: 10/9/2010 Total Score: 3.7A: The pour is an opaque copper color with a fluffy off-white head that settles down to a thin layer.

S: Sweet candi sugar (a theme with Goose Islands Belgian styles), caramel, and bread in the grain/sugar department. Some subtle, but at the same time obviously present, spices. I seem to get some nutmeg and allspice, as well as some slightly grassy hops.

T: The spices are more noticeable on the front end of the palate than they were in the nose. Bready malts and some definite sugar notes, but not exactly cloying. A light caramel note and some hints of strawberry and sweet citrus.

M: The body is medium with a somewhat low carbonation for a Belgian style beer, but not dangerously so.

D: I was hoping for a bit more from this beer. It was good, certainly, but for a beer that is talked about so much, I found it to be a bit uninteresting.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

2367,"2013-09-29",3.3,"The beer is well carbonated, and produces a three-finger thick, pale tan colored head that leaves a fair amount of lacing on the sides of the glass as it slowly recedes. The beer is quite red in color, and shows a clear, amber color. The beer is quite nicely integrated between the hops and oak; aromas of vanilla meld with citrusy hop notes, and woody oak flavors mix with the pine / herbal hop notes. Caramelized malt notes, and as the beer warms up notes oftobacco, touches of cedar, and a definite oak-laden woodiness. and the spicy hop character that gets quite a bit more vibrant.

Definitelya bit over-carbonated, some quick swirls of the glass releases the carbonation though. Lots of caramel flavors support the dominant hop character, which is more herbal than fruity. This has a nice bitterness to it from the hops and this is also accentuated by the astringent oak that lightly peppers the finish. The body has a viscosity to it, and some heft to it, but it remains fairly drinkable. Flavors of pine, berry leaning citrus notes, touches of grapefruit, tongue numbing menthol, lightly toasted sweet brown cracker notes, and touches of spicy grain character.

Pretty nice, the malt character, hops, and oak do play together pretty well here. It does seem to be missing a bit of a punchy, juicy hop character.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Lots of fruity, floral and herbal hops with a light pine. Lemons, pineapples, grapefruits, melons, and some sweeter oranges. Hops mix nicely with a good amount of toffee, a growing vanilla, a light oak, a touch of biscuit, and a bit of a rye spiciness. Flavor is fruity with a good amount of vanilla and grainy malts up front. A mellow oak comes in before the hops really kick in and the bitterness grows. Toffee, a light biscuit, a touch of caramel, and some more rye spiciness mixes with florals, herbal hops, and a light pine. Lemons, grapefruit, and a light orange grows towards the end along with the vanilla where this finishes dry with a bready-toffee and moderate, spicy floral bitterness.

Pours a dark amber-red color with a really nice light tan head and quite a bit of lacing as it goes down. The nose brings a fair amount of citrus and pine hops plus a bit of oak and some sweet amber malt. The taste brings more of the same with a fairly-strong oak presence plus some citrus and pine hops. Body is medium with a slight bitterness. Overall, a decent beer but a bit time and the flavors and scents never really seemed to pop or meld. Hopefully The Bruery will stray out toward styles like this more often, as this was a step in a positive direction.

Aromas are a healthy dose of citrusy hops, lemons and grapefruit, florals, faint pine, with a touch of melon, moving into toffee, oranges, a touch of spiciness. Initial is really crazy, a blast of vanilla beans up front which mellows the initial hop onslaught, a growing bitter hop bite, lemons and florals, grass, touches of grapefruit. Some toffee, biscuits, and toast, the vanilla really sticks on the initial moving into decent florals, bitterness into the finish. Lingering touches of spicy and mellow vanilla envelopes the palate, kills away the big hop bitterness, cool and sweet. Into the backend, more soapy and floral bitterness comes out, touches of more mellow orange, some earthy maltiness, toast, biscuits, lingering toffee into the end of the middle. Finish is orange and lemon, decent bitterness, lingering vanilla, touches of spice. Really interesting, the vanilla transforms the beer, but not for worse.

How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed fresh 2 months after bottling.  Bottle sent to me by kegbear, thanks a lot Craig.
The look: Partly dark golden body topped by a rocky medium beige head with good retention
In long: Strong hoppy nose blending fresh oranges, other citrus fruits and freshly cut wood.  Taste has plenty of citrus fruits (oranges and grapefruits mainly) swimming on a rich but not too sweet caramelized malt backbone.  Some orange peels, some freshly cut oak, some pine needles.  An overall light spicy sensation that seems to be coming from the wood.  This beer is very sharp and bright.  It probably has to do with the oak but everything seems to come out very bright.

The aroma is nice and hoppy, but not too much so.  Caramel, oak, red berries, and earthy and citrusy hops.

The flavor is similar.  The malt has the right about of sweetness.  A great fruitiness comes through - maybe red currants?  Theres a nice caramel malty backbone with mild oak, grapefruity and floral hop notes.

Medium-plus bodied with average carbonation and a pretty nice mouthfeel.

An enjoyable one to drink overall.  If youre going to classify this as an amber ale, its really the class of the style.

Taste: Sweetish flavors of caramel and candy made from orange blossom honey. Touch of apricot. In creaks a spicy, zesty, earthy toasted oak wood character, lightly tannic, and yielding a very small, very distant hint of vanilla. Citrusy, lightly floral hops with a modest amount of bitterness. Preserved oakiness on the drying, fruity finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

2367,"2010-11-07",4.0,"Bought a growler of this for football this Sunday. Smells great, hints of orange and vanilla, but really complex. Goes down very smooth (relatively low ABV for the Bruery), but the taste is a little thin -- which is close to the only flaw in this brew. This is far from an ambitious drink, but agreeable and should go great with a variety of meals.","California, USA","Luckyhank"
2367,"2010-11-05",3.6,"On tap at the La Jolla Brewhouse as Ex-Loakal. Pours cloudy red with a big offwhite head that leaves good lace. Smells like a red. Sweet malts and fruity hops with some mellow earth. Tastes like a red. Fruity and hoppy with some sweet malts. I dont get much wood at all. Little bit of alcohol, thats about it. Medium body, good carbonation.","San Diego, California, USA","doubleo"

2367,"2010-11-03",4.1,"This is one of the best of the year for me.  Smell of fresh cut wood and fruit in the aroma.  Spicy character with medium hop bitterness and a lovely note of wine in the mix.  Hazy red/brown in color.  The lable does not lie.  75% red ale and 25% aged.  Works very well together.","Glendale, California, USA","beersearcher"
2367,"2010-10-31",4.2,"Had on tap at Black Tuesday release party, and my favorite beer of the night. Poured a medium hazy amber color, nose was ripe with citrus hops, caramel, and vanilla. Taste was very complex, light caramel, vanilla, oak, grapefruit, orange zest, just an amazing beer with many layers and still extremely drinkable.","San Diego, California, USA","tokyogoat"
2367,"2010-10-25",4.0,"Appearance: Pours a vibrant amber with a small tight head.

Aroma: Faint sugar sweetness (brown sugar or rock candy sugar perhaps) and oak barrel.

Taste:  The first thing I noticed was oak. A little woody. Then a layer of sweetness that I found in the nose, rock candy sugar, maybe some spicy cinnamon candy as well. The beer finished with a nice punch of spicy hops. Between the hops and oak, I was pretty amazed. As noted by The Bruery, this is their first beer not using their proprietary yeast strain. Not mad at all about that.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, high carbonation, and a little bit sticky.

Overall: Something I could drink all day. I like a spicy hoppy red, and the oak put it over the top for me.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"
2367,"2010-10-23",3.7,"750 mL bottle purchased at Bruery Provisions in Orange, CA.
Sipped out of Bruery tulip.
Pours nice opaque dark amber color.  
Impressive Belgian lace for an amber, definitely above average.  
Head retention duration was above average with clusters forming and maintained until glass finished.
Outstanding aroma. Toffee is definitely pronounced. Sweet caramel-y deliciousness. Subtle hints of oak present with somewhat more subtle vanilla discernible. 
Quite hoppy for an amber. Perhaps the base beer is similar to Alesmiths Halloween seasonal beer, Evil Dead Red, in terms of hoppiness and ABV (6.66% vs 6.9%), though, overall, Loakal Red is a much more complex beer, especially given that a portion of it is barrel aged.
Given Bruerys focus on Belgian style ales, expected more Belgian/yeasty taste, perhaps like a Rare Vos by Ommegang. However, the hop character definitely overpowered any potential yeasty flavor(s) that may have been present.
Slightly hoppier than I would have preferred though overall an amazing ale, with especially outstanding aroma.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"
2367,"2010-10-19",3.8,"On tap. Pours with a clear amber body with an off-white head that lasts and leaves good lacing. The aroma is great with notes of honey, dry grain, vanilla, rye, tannins, subtle fruit notes and a decent amount of hoppiness. Flavors are fruity, grainy, dry, and bitter. Some raspberry preserve, oak and tea. A well done beer. Lively bubbles and dry.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
