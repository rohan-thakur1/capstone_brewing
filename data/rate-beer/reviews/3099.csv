3099,"2012-12-03",4.3,"My particular dread--the vivid possibility that left me staring at tree shadows on the bedroom ceiling night after night--was having to lie in a small tent, alone in an inky wilderness, listening to a foraging bear outside and wondering what its intentions were. I was especially riveted by an amateur photograph in Herreros book, taken late at night by a camper with a flash at a campground out West. The photograph caught four black bears as they puzzled over a suspended food bag. The bears were clearly startled but not remotely alarmed by the flash. It was not the size or demeanor of the bears that troubled me--they looked almost comically non aggressive, like four guys who had gotten a Frisbee caught up a tree--but their numbers. Up to that moment it had not occurred to me that bears might prowl in parties. What on earth would I do if four bears came into my camp? Why, I would die, of course. Literally shit myself lifeless. I would blow my sphincter out my backside like one of those unrolling paper streamers you get at childrens parties--I daresay it would even give a merry toot--and bleed to a messy death in my sleeping bag.

4.0 A: Black color. Two fingers of tan head with good retention and touches of lacing.

4.5 T: Again, a lot of the smoke is gone, but the underlying porter is still mighty tasty. Lots of coffee again, burnt toast, dark roasted malts. Smoke is still there and supplements rather than stealing the show. Touch of plum fruitiness, but overall rather dry. Well done.

4.0 M: Medium body. Decently creamy, good carbonation, super smooth. Soft lasting burntness on the finish.

3099,"2010-12-01",3.8,"In short: A sessionnable chocolaty smoked beer.  Very nice beer
How: Bottle, flip-top 1L.  Consumed relatively fresh a few months after purchase.  Tasting session with Montreal crew.
The look: Dark brown body topped by a medium beige head
In long: Nose is moderately smoky (between smoked ham and smoked wood) with notes of fresh toasted cookies.  Taste is chocolaty (milk chocolate bar), smoke, some caramel, woody hops, very light fruity notes.  The body is very creamy.  With that chocolaty creamy body it felt like eating an Oreo bar around a campfire.  This beer is far from intense, this is actually something that can be drank by the pint.  This is good stuff.  If you are an auto-mechanic from New-Jersey whose family have been New-Jersey auto-mechanics for six generations, then I recommend that you make the drive to Pittsburgh, buy this beer and bring it to a tasting.

3099,"2010-09-29",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Dark chocolate, roasted cereals, peppery hops and fruity smoke coalesce in this very complex and pleasantly quaffable Smoked Porter.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the brownish black.
-Raisiny fruitiness seeps from the light caramel sweetness underneath.
-The smoke character is prevalent in the aroma, but it never becomes too intense in the flavor profile.
-The soft carbonation makes this even more drinkable.

3099,"2009-04-24",4.1,"Courtesy of Beerman6686, thanks again Dan. Pours deep dark brown with thin tan head. The aroma is sweet molasses, some burnt malts, a nice level of smokiness, a bit of char and a sense of bacon. The taste starts with a pleasing pulse of smoke and a touch of bacon. It then moves into burnt notes and sweet caramel. Very even smooth flavors leaving burnt malts and modest smoke to linger deep into the after taste.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Pours dark mahogany out of the bottle and looks almost completely black in the glass.  The head is small but hangs around for a while and leaves bits of lacing.

The aroma is definitely that of a smoked beer but its not overpowering.  There are plenty of sweet malt aromas to balance the smoke, whose presence is more like smoked hickory chips than meats.  Toasted character in the nose

The taste seems a little smokier than the aroma to me and leaves a very dry, smoky finish that lingers for a while after each sip.  There are the dark malts in the background but the smoke in the taste seems a little more like smoked meat, especially sausage, than the aroma.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation and very dry in the finish.

This is a goodgreat smoked beer with a smoked character that doesnt overpower and is complimented by the sweet malts.  Extremely drinkable for the style.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Smoke is forward, in a very nice pork fat, smoked meat, and chewy maple character. This is how smoke should be done in a beer. Much more like one of the german staples than a smoked porter like Alaskan. Delicate perfumy wood smoke, with bits of bark, boughs and buds. The body is much thinner than I would like and it ends a little needlessly bitter.

Flavor is where the ""porter"" shows, mainly roast malt, dark chocolate, and coffee, only slight smoke,very creamy but not nearly as aggressive as the nose.

3099,"2009-02-03",4.1,"A solid pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a fat-two-finger thick, lightly browned, dark tan colored head.  The beer is a black color with a touch of rich brown to it and is almost opaque except for a few ruby flashes of color if held up directly to the light.  The aroma is a satisfying mix of smoke, toasted malt and dry biscuit-like aromatics.  Towards the finish is noticeable some light, roasted grain notes that add some coffee like aromatics.  I cant get over how rich and malt the nose is; the smoke is here and ample, but it melds with and even accentuates the rich, dark malt character that is naturally here in the nose.  This has quite an enticing nose to it.

Somewhat light bodied up front, the beer picks up a touch of heft to it in the middle, but still remains a beer to be quaffed.  The beer starts out a little colder than I might have liked (probably close to 40°F / 4.5°C), but it is still quite flavorful.  Up front this has a rich chocolate note to it that quickly takes on a combination of rich smokiness and substantial toasted malt character.  Rich browned malt character and the savory smoke character combine to make this quite a meal despite not being overly heavy.  This does pick up some creamy texture as the beer warms up.  Each sip finishes with the roasted malt character coming through; it adds a touch of burnt acidity that dries things out just a bit as well as some black coffee like roast character and a burnt graininess.  There is a touch of fruitiness here, that is at times quite noticeable, but at others not so much; this reminds me a bit of burnt, sweet plums or burnt raisins.  The roast character adds a bit of burnt-bitterness to this beer, but there is also a pine-like hop bitterness to this beer.  As the beer warms up the texture just gets richer, more full-bodied, but still is quite drinkable.

This is a great beer to drink a liter bottle of.  I cant be happier with the two beers I have had from East End and to be honest I dont see how they can get any better than this (someone prove me wrong).  Just a great beer; full of flavor, yet quaffable enough to enjoy a couple glass over an evening.  The smoke really is at a perfect level here, tons of rich malt character is still able to come through, while the smoke character just boosts the flavor and richness of this beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

There is a very nice smoke aroma to this beer, backed by a bit of chocolate malt.  The smoke shows up slightly in the flavor, only problem is that thats about it.  This beer is not very complex, but does have a nice sweet and roasty malt character, just not enough to compete with the smoke.  The mouthfeel is too thin, it was almost watery.

The aroma is interesting and faithful. It slowly glugs out of the bottle with a gentle slow pour. This is a very opaque dark brownish black liquid. The flavor is very complex and burned earth. It is as if somebody got a spatchula and scraped out some of the inside of an old J&L steel mills smokestack and mixed it into this glass. This appears to have a rather high alky content. A real mouth coating experience. Inspiring festive nighttime in a bottle. Annoying and irritating in its own mild special way.   Taste reminds me of one of my favorite sweet stouts, but a little more offensive. More carbonation than I expected out of a growler.

The flavor is roasty rauchy dark malt, some brown sugar, molasses, figs, and slight nuts.  Despite the rauchiness, there is some malty sweetness here.  The palate is medium, and seems to water out a bit throughout the repours (and the 1 L bottle took me two repours to finish).  Overall, this is a very unique style.
