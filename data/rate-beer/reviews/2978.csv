As much as I LOVE Three Floyds...my god this one kinda sucked....but it was fun to pay $5/pint for it!","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","wickster"
2978,"2006-05-24",2.7,"On tap at the brewpub.  Some people have been slamming this but I thought it was ironic that one of the best breweries in the world makes what most people would consider the worst style of beer and then name it after a blaxploitation film.  What you would expect?  No head.  Macro color.  No lacing.  No taste. Just bland adjunt beer.  I loved it for what it was.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","screigh"
2978,"2006-05-16",3.1,"not my style but for a malt liquor it was not bad.strong and very carbonated.it was a good try at a malt liqour and i have friends who will like this.me i like the more hop up 3fff.CHEERS.","Kissimmee, Florida, USA","railcat1"
2978,"2006-05-05",2.9,"So, they make a malt liquor.  And its not bad.  A deep amber body rests under a foamy white head.  The aroma is Illini Super Sweet mixed with malt and hops (oh what a surprise).  Medium to full body with lively carbonation.  The corn in the flavor was sort of like a roasted corn.  Not bad but certainly not the high point of Dark Lord Day.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
2978,"2006-05-01",3.5,"Draught at 3Fs brewpub. The low ratings here reveal the style bias pervasive on this site. Make no mistake, this is an outstanding malt liquor (or bock, if you prefer), one that I enjoyed even more than my recollection of DFHs Liquor de Malt. Not much in the way of aroma. Yellow body to moderate gold. Fizzy, white head. Not much lace and average sized head. Very strong alcohol profile, despite ""only"" being 7%. Some pepper on the tongue. Lots of flavor. Very good.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
2978,"2006-05-01",3.2,"Draft... DLD06... Clear, deep yellow lager with a mid-sized, creamy, white head. Malty aroma with notes of apricot and toffee. The mostly balanced, alcoholic  flavor holds hints of corn and dry grain. Full-bodied and fizzy. Finishes lightly sweet and lightly bitter.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
2978,"2006-05-01",3.0,"Out of a paper bag with MIBRomeo while walking the mean streets of Munster.  (Hard to take this one seriously.)  Transparent and paling bronze in color with a creamy whitish-grey head thats pocked with pinholes aplenty.  Pineapple aroma meets lemon-glazed tamales, along with citric hop accentuations, herbal corn flakes, peach fuzz, lavender and freesia.  Hard to know which way this one was going to go based on its inability to frighten me in any of its powerful wafts, but we soon found out.  Cool substances hark a corny lager persona from the get-go.  Hop bite is more accentuated by the superjuiced alcohol quotient.  Loose flavor fall-off, ringing with musky cologne, corn husks, pils malt and tarnished, sucked-up and spit out turnips.  Corn meal and malt-o-meal become more enhanced as it grows a degree warmer.  The ""serve cold thesis"" couldnt be more true and more of a warning.  Corn flakes, liquefied, then peppered and scraped out of aluminum tins keep gaining momentum.  Near the end, its downright hot.  I now know the meaning of ethanol burn and how it feels gestationally.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

2978,"2006-05-01",3.0,"On tap during DL day. Poured with a white head and a medium colored gold body. The aroma was bread with some almonds. I was surprised to get very litte of the sweet corn smell. The taste taste was slight corn with ham and some peanuts. Good for the style.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
2978,"2006-04-30",2.0,"One of the softest malt liquors that Ive ever drunk, yet still having that somewhat stale, sweet corn odor that weve come to expectfrom such a brew.  Same with the flavor.  The heavy fuel aroma and harsh alcohol burn werent present.  Worth drinking once.<font size=-4>From the brewpub at the <a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/events-detail.asp?eve Lord Release - Three Floyds, Munster, IN - 04/29/2006<font size=-1>","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
2978,"2006-04-30",2.4,"Obviously a small-batch spoof of the style in general.   Sweet corn adjunct all the way, a flavor that  not even these guys could save with an unstylistic high dose of hops.  Good for a laugh but thats about all.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","RAYBOY01"
2978,"2006-04-23",2.8,"Darker than most malt liquors.  This is gross, slightly hoppy and alcoholic.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"
2978,"2006-04-23",2.1,"draft at the brewpub - but i hated it and asked for a different beer.  awful.  fruity flavor, but it just tastes bad.  kinda watered down.  kinda gawdy horrible sweetness.  yuck.","chicago, Illinois, USA","sersdf"
2978,"2006-04-23",3.6,"Draft at Floyds. Frankly, calling this a malt liquor and brewing it with corn does not put it on the same stage with a Steel Reserve, Its much better than that. In an English pint glass, it shows a copper-amber color with a slight, clingy head. Plenty of corn an alcohol in the nose. I did find something in the taste to reming me of a Colt .45. Solid malts, and yes, plenty of fermented corn, but without cloying sweetness of alcohol fusels. True to its Floyd-ness, there lots of hops here, but just the noble bittering hops to keep the sweetness in check. A chewy body that gets sweeter after all as I go further down the glass.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
2978,"2006-03-20",2.8,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2007 This has got to be some kind of sick joke.  There are exactly 2 malt liquors made that I will bring my self to try.  This one the the one DFH does.  Hazy yellow/orange.  This one is sweet and sweet, with some sweet at the end.  There are some sweet hops that manage to come off sweet as well.  Full bodied.  I found this one hard to finish.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
2978,"2006-03-19",3.3,"Ha! Im thinking this is the same groovy, corn harshy malt liquor from Piece.  Always more fun to order it first to kick start the round of drinking.  I must admit, I liked it better covered up by the little paper bags, but the pizza here is better than the pizza there (matters what kind of pizza Im hungry for). Big alcohol fumes, corny sweet taste. Some toastiness and dryness at the finish...ok, now Im ready for a Dreadnaught...","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
2978,"2006-03-11",3.4,"Super amped up malt liquor.  This aint your store bought variety.  Really sweet like candy corn I guess, but with more of a corn oil taste.  Big and chewy texture.  There was this stinginess carbination quality to it.  Hops are there to give it some character.  Id actually drink this beer on a regular basis.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
2978,"2006-02-26",3.0,"Oh boy its Malt Liquor kids. No matter what I tried to tell myself I couldnt get past the fact that lurking under all the other flavors of this was that same syrupy corn taste that you find in any malt liquor. Had some hops fighting a losing battle with everything else, but it was certainly the best malt liquor Ive had. For whatever that statement is worth.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
