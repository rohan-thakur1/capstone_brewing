Well conditioned, minute carbonation raises a compact, tight pad of white atop a radiant, deep, ruddy copper body. The head holds to lace a fine weave. And that is where it ended for me! Strawberry, pear and lychee sits awkwardly aside notes of fresh crushed raw peanuts,  damp, spent grain, rusted car body and treated pine. And further down the hill.... Very woody on the palate, tannic with a taste reminiscent of choking on peanut husks. Frothy and foamy mouthfeel. Body is quite light, ends quite gammy, slick and lasting. Muddled toffee, burnt caramel and burnt toasted bread otherwise dominates, but it seems watery and desperate for definition. The fruit esters of the aroma have been made redundant.

Upon tasting it has a wonderful ful-bodied mouthfeel. A million bubbles burst when I swirl this around my mouth.

Many will like this typically eccentric take on a strong ale from the Yeasties, but I think this is one where their love of complex malt didnt meet my own desire for hoppiness.  There is a bit of bitterness within here, but for my taste buds I think the style needs more.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","buzz_and_hum"

... you know that slightly floral aromatic hard-to-pin-down flavour that really good prosciutti has... thats what I mean!

1325,"2011-04-10",4.1,"I consider this to be a Scottish ""wee heavy"" and I havent had one of those for years, certainly not outside Scotland. Beautiful old gold going on tawny colour. Rich deep palate, definitely sweet, but stopped from being cloying by a slight burnt caramel edge which sharpens it up. Excellent example of a rare style.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","mgbridges"
