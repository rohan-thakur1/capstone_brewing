4039,"2017-02-26",4.1,"Keg at the brewery taproom. Pours unclear yellow-gold with a light, foamy white head. The nose has massive dank hop character, tropical fruits, cat piss. Medium sweet flavour, nicely dry but also dank, with notes of melon, grapefruit, peach. Light to medium bodied with fine to average carbonation. Lightly resinous on the finish, with more dry and pithy citrus, pee, melon, grapefruit. Outstanding.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

4039,"2016-11-10",3.8,"Draft pour on tap at the brewery tap room (San Francisco, CA). Pours a hazy pineapple juice pour, glowing and murky, frothy whitish head atop sits around, filmy with good ringer atop that laces well. Aromas are a bit bitter, earthy, floral with some white grape, melon, bready malts as it settles. Initial is lighter bodied, a nice fruity melon flavor with some tropical wafts, cereal grainy and dry appeal. Some citric flashes, more florals, a kiss of tropical fruit. The green fruity melon up front tapers off as we press on but certainly leaves an impression. A bit earthy, mineral bitter appeal on we round the corner. Mellow tropical and melon flavors, sufficient bitterness and cleaner malt elements. A bit bready, subtle fruity nectar, bitterness as we round it all out. A more mellow nose, solid pour, flavors that pop up front tapering to a more bitter backend and finish. Nice stuff.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

4039,"2016-04-11",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2016 Poured from a 22 oz bomber; I?m so happy they are bottling now. Aroma is very hop forward with a medium light malt backbone with cracker and biscuit as well as some bready yeast notes. Lots of melon and tropical fruit with some dank resin notes. Light white wine and stone fruit notes. Pours a very cloudy, murky, pale yellow straw color with a medium sized, moderately thick white head that shows good retention as it slowly recedes. Medium high lacing and small legs. Flavor is slightly sweet with a dry finish. Moderately strong cracker and biscuit malt notes with some bready yeast characteristics. Medium to medium high bitterness. Lots of melon, mango, guava and other tropical fruit. Some light onion dank notes with hints of citrus. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Overall, I love nelson sauvin hops and while this isn?t the greatest exhibition of them it?s still a great pale ale. Nice malt backbone that adds some character, especially in the flavor.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

4039,"2016-04-06",5.0,"Like attracts like is a rule of thumb in organic chemistry. Dishwashing detergents for cleaning greasy plates are a classic example. Cellarmaker often uses the same aroma hop both in the kettle for bittering and in cold tanks for flavoring, even when they arent classified as dual purpose like Nelson Sauvin. My speculation is that essential oils from the aroma hops in the kettle ""prime the pump"" for better extraction of the essential oils of the aroma hops in the cold tanks. But what do I know? I know that the fruity/floral flavors in the April 2016 batch of Mt. Nelson have tremendous resonance (thunder thiols?), based on my ""beer belch"" test.

An exceptional example of a single hop Nelson pale. Taste is heavier than most pales, so much in fact it could pass for an IPA. Heavy notes of straw, barnyard, and tropical fruit on the nose.
