1257,"2017-06-19",3.7,"11.2floz bottle, BBD: 10.22.2017, paid about $2.50 for a single that I poured into a pint glass. It is good to get fresh Fullers, and finding their beers has gotten tougher over the years. Excellent copper/amber color and one finger of head retaining its character as it settles to a solid covering. As expected the nose is of buttery-caramel. Ill rate this a couple tenths higher than I would an Americanized version, since it is traditional, and getting a traditional American brewed ESB is very difficult. Palate is medium, has soft carbonation, and tastes like toasted bread without burnt flavors, light caramel, and some lactic acidity that hampers the flavor profile. A pretty good pub worthy ale.","","balloonbuffoon"

Bottle, 500 ml. Pours clear deep reddish amber with a finger of dense, off-white head which dissipates into a thin sheen. Thick lacing and lots of small bubbles visible. Glowing! Aroma is rich, sweet, malty and fruity but also comes off as fairly fresh and light. Theres a lot of marmalade or candied orange up front, edges of citrus and maybe a touch of apple juice, a light yet hearty honey and biscuit malt backbone, bit of golden syrup making an appearence maybe and a whiff of clove. Fresh, grassy hops emerge as it warms. Very well balanced aroma! Taste is sweet and fruity to begin with with more citrus, apple and now blood orange, joined by light caramel malts which merge into biscuit and slightly cakey notes. Finish is long, dry, peppery and mildly bitter. Medium body and super smooth on the palate with a touch of tingly carb to boost the refereshment factor. Fairly light and refreshing AND rich and subtle at the same time, so good for winter or summer, rain or shine! Really cant fault this much; what a phenomenal beer.","Kent, ENGLAND","Cybion"

Was left over from a New Years Eve party. Had a bottle with a friend and actually liked it. Gave it a 3.75 on Untappd, but think it will be higher here. Surprised I had never reviewed it. I guess Im not exactly and expert with this style, so will go into it with an open mouth.

Poured a light amber clear color with two fingers of off-white frothy head. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Average spotty lacing. Average retention. (Sight - 3.75)

Smelled caramel, toffee, earthy floral, plum, spoiled dark fruits, unsweetened iced tea and rye spices. (Smell - 4.25)

1257,"2015-06-02",4.6,"BBD 8/3/15. Pours a clear amber with a slight garnet cast. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

Rich world class complex nose of citrus hops (orange), herbal hops (coupled with an airy spice note), huge caramel malt and the classic mineral water. As it warms, a touch of diacetyl (butter) is noticed.

Medium bodied with a silky smooth texture that approaches creamy. Soft, but perfect, carbonation that releases an effervescent undercurrent from the middle on. 

The flavor profile is world class and is the standard to which others are judged. It is intense, complex and balanced to perfection. Some ESBs take the bitterness too far, this one takes it to perfection. It begins with a wave of sweet citrus (mostly orange), but no hint of rind. Then the other hop aspects (earthy, with only a hint of being dank) appear. Underneath is a rich malt base of caramel and light crystal that balances to perfection. The middle is mildly bitter, but he bitterness is smooth and retains its varied flavor components along with a hint of toffee. The finish is where the classic mineral aspects of the water shine and add the final layer of complexity. The finish is a slow fade of mineral sweetness with just a touch of bitterness.

1257,"2015-03-27",3.6,"Very sparse head. Color is amber but more orange to it than a pure amber. Very clear (free of haze or particles).
Aroma is interesting - orange aromas, caramel/butterscotch, a bit of bread.
Taste is mildly sweet with a fairly low level of bitterness.
Medium body; texture unremarkable; carbonation just a tad low; finish is fairly long, with carbonation, sweetness and lingering bread and orange. Alcohol is low to medium, at least by craft beer standards.

In summary, I really like the unusual orange aromas, with interest added by the caramel and bread notes. For my taste, it is a little on the thin side and not super complex, which suppressed my rating a bit. However it is a fairly unique and quite interesting beer that I would recommend and will enjoy again.","Michigan, USA","smroush"

Wonderful bitter, even considering this was the USA import version rather than the cask version. Very nice malty finish with some hops presence.

OCZY : piwo jest kompletnie przejrzyste o kolorze złocistego bursztynu. Piana jest mala i szybko znika całkowicie. 

NOS : piwo pachnie karmelem, lekko podpalanym. Do tego toffi, francuskie ciasto, herbatniki, czarna herbata, bezy, kwiaty, miód, troszeczkę banana i wiśni. Po wstrząśnięciu alkoholowy aromat przypomina porto. Można również wyczuć czerwone jabłka. 

USTA : piwo jest mało gazowane o konsystencji wody z sokiem. 
Ogólnie piwo jest średnio słodkie o nutach słodowych podobnych do mało słodkiego herbatnika. Delikatnie kwaśnieje (bardzo delikatnie) i uwalniając nuty owocowe i tarty, delikatnie nasiąkniętej alkoholem. Piwo ma delikatna gorycz która przypomina zarazem zioła, skórkę pomarańcza, przypalone ciasto jest delikatnie alkoholowa. Jest to piwo gdzie smaki są tak wyważone, że mam problemy się dosadnie określić. Posmak jest lekko palony jak mocno zarumieniony gofr z miodem. 

ODCZUCIA : łatwe w piciu i nawet orzeźwiające. Po prawie wypitej butelce czuje piekący posmak chmielu, którego obecność w pierwszym łyku nie zapowiadała takich niespodzianek. Z tego piwa będę przede wszystkim pamiętał balans. Potworny balans, który wprowadził spore zamieszanie bo piwo na pierwszy rzut nie wydaje się takie kompleksowe.

1257,"2014-08-13",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2016  
 Served on tap in a pint glass
  Appearance  The beer is served a deep golden amber color with a tiny head of white foam.  The head fades very fast leaving just a trace of lace on the sides of the glass.
   Smell  The aroma of the brew is fantastic.  It is heavy of a caramel and toffee sweetness along with a nice bready smell.  Along with these aromas are some earthy and floral hop smells as well as some lighter nutty and slightly doughy aromas.
   Taste- The taste begins sweet caramel and toffee flavor mixed with a slightly buttery doughy taste.  As the taste advances the doughiness takes on more of a bready flavor as a little bit of graininess and nuttiness works its way on the tongue.  All the while the hop that were detected in the nose starts to become evident adding a nice lighter earthy and floral flavor to the beer.  The hops increase toward the end of the taste, but never become too potent, and end up leaving one, with a rather smooth caramel and balanced taste to linger on the tongue.
   Mouthfeel  The body of the brew is on the slightly thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is rather low.  For the rich caramel and bready tastes matched with the lighter earthy and floral hop, the feel is fantastic and makes for a smooth and creamy easy drinking brew.
  Overall  This is a very nice ESB I have to say.  It is balanced very well and has some very rich and smooth flavors.  I can see as to why Fullers ESB is thought of as a representative of the ESB.","","Darkmagus82"

1257,"2014-07-18",4.4,"Nice reddish brown, with a head that fades away pretty soon.

Big, malty aroma with caramel and cereal notes, add some orange zest. On the nose its a bit roasty and closed in, but I feel the beer really opens up once it hits the mouth (maybe becaues I have a cold). 

Now the complexity really reveals itself as the cereal tone of the malt is balanced by layer after layer of fudgy caramel and rich chocolate, and the slight orange zest blossoms into a spectrum of citrus, with lemon peel and grapefruit.

The taste is fairly bitter but well-balanced, with a slight sweetness. Just the way I want it with this sort of beer.

The body is full and creamy, with a lovely fizziness that dissipates just a little bit too quickly, just like the foam. Nice, dry, long finish.

This was poured into a pint glass. 
The appearance was a ruddy burnt amber to orange to reddish color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within less than a minute leaving some light foamy lacing that trickled down the glass. 
The smell had a sweet malty base grabbing some earthy figs to jump into a gentle light nutty to caramel maltiness. 
The taste had a really nice sweet nutty to caramel flavoring with a quick dry finish. 
On the palate, this one sat right at a medium on the body. The carbonation was somewhat sharp but still let in a great creamy smoothness to grace my tongue. 
Overall, I say this was one fine ESB more than worthy to have again. This one defines the style.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Just enough bitterness to give it a nice kick, but still goes down smooth and fast! One comment I will make is I find this ESB slightly inconsistent, I come across more slightly off (but still very drinkable) bottles of this as I do with any other ESBs. For this reason its not worthy of getting a grade in the 90s. On saying that, its still one of the first beers that land in my basket when Im beer shopping.","","karmagarda"

1257,"2013-04-20",2.0,"500ml bottle bought at CitySuper in New Town Plaza, Shatin.
Clear amber  colour; Two finger head and crumpety off-white foam which last for 1 minutes; Small but sticky lacing with notable carbonation;
Aroma of sweet malt, red fruit, orange, light caramel, herbs and grass; Mild and light sweet taste of malt, with bread, biscuits, plus light dose of toffee, grapefruit and orange, and grassy hops; Medium body, slick and quite oily palate; Hoppiness, be that aroma or taste, is really light, not expressive at all. You can taste the grapefruit and FEEL the bitterness, but its in such a light dose its nowhere near the potency and freshness of American craft brew. Hoppy finish is underwhelming; Pretty dry after taste, very easy to mouth.

Comments: This beer may be the pioneer of Bitter style back then, but compare to other good Bitters, Blonde Ale, or even other Fullers standout lineups, this one is flat and uninspiring, with taste and feel like a very average Bitter.

1257,"2013-03-13",3.9,"Reviewed 3/11/13. 
11.2 oz bottle into a nonic pint glass.

A: Pours a clear copper color. The head is a one finger offwhite shade. It slowly fades to a thin film, and leaves some (not much) lacing on the glass. Generally, an attractive beer.

S: At first, I notice rich caramel, brown sugar, and earthy hops. Then the aroma permutes into something wonderfully fruity. I really enjoy the cherry, apple, and grape esters this provides. I mean, really, REALLY enjoy them, even if they dont come across terribly strongly.

T: Taste-wise, Im not a fan of the style; but this one works quite well. Vaguely sweet caramel maltiness provides the backbone, supported by an initial hit of tart, fruity esters. Drying hops and faint diacetyl finish this one off. If anything, its gorgeously balanced, with just a suggestion of depth to keep it interesting. Didnt live up to the aroma, however.

M: Dry and crisp, though some toffee flavors linger on the palate somewhat. Carbonation could be upped a hair to make it cleaner, though - given the way the complex flavors shift on the aftertaste, Ill call it a wash. This one is easy to drink.

O: Id say its the best ESB Ive ever had, even with the qualifiers of A) the style doesnt tickle my fancy, and B) I havent had enough good offerings of the style for it to tickle my fancy in the first place. Out of personal preference, Id much rather have their London Porter; but just in terms of objective quality, theyre at the same level.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

T-- Malt, carmel and a little bit of hops to this and pretty straight forward. Does have a bit of a watery taste but not that serious an issue. Does get better warmer but the watery taste is still there.

M-- Finishes dry with a little bit of sweetness. Light bodied and very little carbonation. Has a creamy feel in the mouth as well.

D-- Not bad, but not mindblowing either. Maybe I like other ESBs more. Very drinkable and quite sessionable. Balance is excellent. In some ways feels and tastes lighter than the 5.9% listed.

Hoppy aroma with spruce, flowers, some herbs and a little resin. As delicious as an IPA, but lighter. The aroma of the malt also appears with some honey and caramel, but the hops are stonger, although it makes the beer richer and more complex. Light bitter taste, because of the hops.

1257,"2012-03-13",2.7,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/30/2011.  Poured from an 11.2 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

The beer itself is a light transparent caramel color with an amber tint and a few spots of pink where the light shines through the glass. A rocky off-white head gets to medium height with an aggressive pour, fading to a small cap for the duration. 

Sweetness is the most prominent scent in an underwhelming nose. Light bready malt has a caramel candy sweetness. A bit of a nutty aroma sand earthy hops sneak into my nostrils as well.

The flavor also starts sweet. Toasted malt bring some caramel flavor with it, and then some lightly bitter earthy hops present a long, flat bitterness for the second half of each sip. The finish is a bit bitter. 

The carbonation is mostly creamy with just a bit of a crisp bite. I would say smooth, but lack of character or watery might be more accurate. The body drinks on the light side of medium. A bit of oily residue is left behind my lips after the sip.

This is an easy beer to drink, and it would be a good beer to have in hand while involved in a good conversation that required little attention be paid to the beer. With a thorough analysis, however, it is a bit uninspiring. If this is the model for all ESBs, they should stop brewing this style.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

With a small malty background and a bitterness thats light to medium from start to middle. Ends abruptly and for good reason: drinkability. And drinkability is what drives this, with the low alcohol, mild and unobtrusive aroma to the low carbonation and accessible bitterness. Its pretty good in that sense. But I cant help but feel bored and feel like Id rather drink something more flavourfull in lower quantities. A more distinctive hop profile would do.

Aroma is lots of caramel malts with some little licorice thrown in. Hops seems to be on the grassy/resin side. Good, but not exactly groundbreaking, either (7).
Taste is pretty much caramel malts with a pretty good (if somewhat some) hop kick. Some coffee and pepper as well. Kinda more complex than what the aroma suggested (7+)
Mouthfeel is a bit watery. Carbonation is extremely low, but thats not much of a problem (for the style... I think). A bit astringent, however. (3)
Overall... Well, its supposed to be the queen of ESBs, and, well, its a pretty good beer.

Flavor is similar and has this thing where I almost think its sweet, but not really, and ah, there it is, lurking behind some gentle bitterness and a hint of tang to keep it lively.

Full flavour, body and everything you want. Citrus peel, spice, pepper, wine gums, jersey caramel are all present in a firm, silky body. If there was one beer that I would like to be buried with in the forlorn off-chance that theres life after death and I can take it with me...

1257,"2011-08-02",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2014 Bottle with a best before of 05.08.11 into a Chimay Trappist glass. 

Aroma: Surprisingly complex, and quite reminiscent of a 26 year old Trappistes Rochefort 8 I recently had, though nowhere near as intense. Malty, some citric sourness, slight rotten fruit, almonds, quite estery, some evidence of candied sugar/toffee. Its also got an odd solventy/alcoholic/wooden smell to it.

Appearance: A pour that would make a Belgian flare up only produced minimal head. Crystal clear burnt amber color. 

Taste: Burnt wood, black coffee, some toffee sweetness, but it lacks flavour and theres an odd taste in this beer I cant put my finger on...again, much like the old Rochefort and it really feels like its missing something.

Palate: Watery, carbonation is missing, alcohol present and is much more solvent like than usual. Astringent.

Overall: This bottle is clearly past its prime and has gone ""bad"", but offers insight on how the actual product should be. Interesting experience and I will re-rate a fresh bottle...should be much better then and I honestly didnt think this would be any good in the first place!

Re-Rate on Jan. 3/13

Aroma: Same as before except the weird old Rochefort smell is gone and in its place the orange and cherry mentioned in the description. A lot less sour than I remember and certainly more caramel/toffee notes. Interesting.

Appearance: Same. 

Taste: Full of toffee flavour, rich malts, less black coffee and burnt wood than the previous IIRC. The sourness is a lot less in this too. For some reason this has some ""digestive"" cookie notes too. Up from 5 to 7.

Palate: Quite smooth, very quaffable, CO2 minimal but that makes it easier to taste the beer. Not super complex but still interesting and man is is drinkable! Up from 2 to 3.

Overall: Much better than the last one, this is a fine brew.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","RD400F"
1257,"2011-08-01",3.8,"Bottle (500ml): A strong mixture of caramel & toffee works well together & is quickly followed up by some nice earthy malts & a biscuit like smell. The beer is a very sweet smelling one but at the same time isnt too sugary.

Dark orange/amber in colour, perfectly still & quite clear with a foamy white head that is about a finger width high. This eventually settles after a minute or two, down to a thin soap lacing.

Very much like the smell with a toffee taste dominating along with more earthy malts & hops. As expected it is quite sweet with hints of fruits & nice bite at the end.

Medium bodied & silky smooth with excellent carbonation; an excellent beer & goes down so easily.

A very pleasant & enjoyable beer with a beautiful sweet toffee taste that is backed up by hints of fruits & earthy malts throughout. It is very well balanced with no flavour overpowering another & goes down easily.

The flavor is light caramel and a little bit of butter (diacetyl perhaps? in this case I guess it is in the right context). There is a faint grassy hop note and an overall interesting creamy texture, thanks largely to the low carbonation and the diacetyl. The maltiness fades to a somewhat drier finish with notes of earth and wood.

1257,"2010-10-03",3.7,"Rating #427, can from Ingerlis  

A darker beer than I had expected, but by being light brown and having a small unstable head it doesnt give more than an average introduction. Aroma is somewhat better with cocoa, sweet caramel and a bit of a flowery nose. More malty flavor than expected, and this is all in all mostly marked by caramel, flowers and a bit of berries that reminds me of Batemans Rosey Nosey. Spicyness is more obvious towards the finish, which is not as bitter hopped as expected, but a bit alcoholic. This doesnt disturb the beer but underlines it characteristics, so as a resumé this is actually a very pleasent expierience and a rather balanced brew. A bit acridness can be found, though, but together with other elements of the beer, that seems almost invisible. Palate is soft and the beer is creamy. Nice one.","Nysted, DENMARK","flemmingwillum"

11.2 ounce bottle.  Pours a bright orange, sort of the color of fresh rust, with a sturdy foam head that pocks the longer it sits there.  Lacing can best be described as average.  Doesnt stick around long.  Aroma catches you off guard - its almost sweet.  Smells a bit like freshly baked french bread.  Malt, followed up by an interesting green apple / apple cider type character.  Huh.  Wasnt expecting that at all.  Medium body, heavier than the aroma would lead you to believe, with a good level of bitterness in the finish.  Guess they dont call it an ESB for nothing.  Flavor is pretty damn impressive.  Complex malt washes over the mouth first before giving way to a refreshing green apple (looks like thats what I was smelling) hop finish.  Malt character makes the beer almost sweet, but it never heads into that syrupy area so many others find themselves.  Further drinking yields this pleasant earthiness.  Mouthfeel is thick and bready.  Wow.  After just a few tastes I can appreciate why this brew is considered the prototype against which all other ESBs are measured.

CYBI just did this and London Pride (which Ive had several times since finding RB) and well, I just had to give it another shot.   This is substantial malty stuff, and it really doesnt surprise me that a few hundred American breweries have copied and bastardized it.   The beer pours a medium-dark amber color, clear (filtered), and has a lasting medium white head.   The aroma is a blend of toasty malt, rich caramel, and dark dried fruit.   I know that they dry hop this, but with only a month to go before this bottles best-by date, theyve pretty much dropped out of the nose.   The flavor has a big rich caramel character and a fat toasty, nutty pale ale malt base.   Hops give a light tangy, spicy flavor and medium bitterness that lasts into the finish.   Medium-fruity on the yeast side, but nothing destinct, and leaves a nice residual maltiness.   Full in the mouth with medium but smooth carbonation.   Definitely a full, malty beer with just enough hop balance to remain drinkable.   Not overly sweet, but with a nice rich caramel character.

Overall fantastic, will strive to achieve this in my own brews.","Little Rock, Arkansas, USA","moseefus"
1257,"2010-07-10",2.9,"330ml bottle. Looks great, pouring a clear ruby amber, with a sizeable head. The nose is a curious mix of citrus and sweet malt. The initial hops are mainly of the resin variety, and come across as unpleasantly oily on the palate. The finish is nice enough, with a few caramel malt notes, but it is a bit too watery. All in all this is a passable beer that is let down by its palate. Not as good as I was expecting, and a fairly average bitter all up.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"
1257,"2010-07-08",4.0,"Pours darker than expected: a transparent cedar red. Dominant and powerful honey and caramel aroma with hints of cherry and whiskey.

Rich body verging on syrupy is lightened a little by substantial carbonation. Taste has big but gentle buttery toffee sweetness with hints of darker sugars. Also old oranges, cardamom, white pepper. Lots of nice flavours but it doesnt seem alive and lacks depth. Lingering finish of fruit and mild bitterness. The last time I had this beer it was on cask in Chiswick - oddly this is better than I remember it from then.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
1257,"2010-06-27",3.2,"Pours an reddish amber with a loose off white head which lows into a thin lacing that lasts for most of the drink.  Aroma is marmalade and caramel, dusty hops and a bit of a biscuit scent; there is some honey and some spiciness.  Taste is big marmalade maltiness, a sweet bittering, Christmas pudding, and just a tad of the hops.  There is something like lemon grass in here too.  Mouth feel is pleasant, creamy and full with a nice low carbonation.  There is a good finish to this beer, with the hops finding their place and the bittering cleaning the palate.  At ABV 5.9% Id say this is a good beer served below cool on warm days, and served above cool on cold ones.  A balanced all rounder.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","theSlipperyPen"

With half the bottle gone, Im getting baby scotch notes. Bottle conditioned comfort should be the tagline on this lovely little guy. Not something that is brilliant or vehemently challenging, Fullers ESB is a relaxing beer that stuns with its silky mellowness.

Palate is medium bodied and malt driven with a very nice caramel tinged floral dry hop bitterness in the finish. Immensely smooth and drinkable with the ABV well hidden. An excellent ESB and rather under-rated on this site in my opinion. I have been on a tour of the Fullers brewery in West London (highly recommended by the way) and can attest to the care and attention they put into brewing their beers. For instance, they insist that every publican who sells their cask conditioned beers is certified in cellaring and handling real ales. Regular inspections are undertaken by the brewery to uphold standards. The best pubs are awarded a Masters of Cellaring - something to bare in mind when you are next out drinking in London.","FNQ, Australia, ","floydian1"

1257,"2009-09-25",3.4,"500. These square-shouldered Fullers bottles look great. Homebrew would look great in them, too, if I had the patience to collect enough of them to bottle a batch in em. But I dont think my love for Fullers, outside of the 1845 and the London Porter, goes that far. This one pours a crystal clear medium amber, maybe a little closer to a dark amber. Sweet bready malt nose; gingerbready and a bit molassesy. Smells like a sweet brown bread youd serve with a stew. Bodys a bit watery and light, very little carb showing. No doubt this is rather in the style tradition for many devoted fans, but it seems rather indifferently presented compared to the full-bodied ales with spectacular, picture-perfect aspects that have proliferated in the last 20-30 years. Very cookie-ish mid-palate with raisins, caramel, a bit of toffee, and some molasses. Definitely too sweet for me to session, and, given my sweet tooth, thats going some.

Maybe someone had a BBQ going...strange indeed. It was pork with some sort of orange sauce - no question about the cooked meat. Note that this was not a strong dominating aroma in any sense, but there hiding. Taste was way more bitter that I figured it would be or that I could remember from the last time I had this.

Aroma: Malts are the expected tea biscuit, but with a little something else that reminds me of graham cracker pie crust; hops are jammy and have a touch of spice. Appearance: Has a rich copper colour with soft carbonation holding up a foamy tan head that settles into a sticky, patchy skin. Flavour: A rich toffee/biscuit maltiness initially with a growing orange marmalade-like hop presence; the finish is spicy, lightly bitter and mostly dry. Palate: Full body, sticky texture, very soft carbonation, bitter finish. Overall: From the bottle, when fresh, this is still a pretty stellar beer; from the keg its so often old and lifeless.

Sampling notes:
Served slightly chilled in goblet.
Pours a picture perfect clean reddish-bronze body with a dense, rocky, pesistant beige cap.
Malt dominated the nose; typical crystal, nuts and toffee, hops are very well entwind, bold earthy spice, bitter orange marmalade, grass and leaf, slightly woody even but not in the pine/cedar sense of American hops.
Body is rich and full, smooth and creamy with a soft carbonation reminisant of a cask poured pint. Bitterness is apparent early on but always integrated with the malt sweetness.
Once again, the flavour screams excellent balance; burnt toffee maltiness, bit of smoke possible, bitter orange and lemon rind, tabbacco leaf, unripe plums. 
Im really just throwing out ideas that come to my mind as I sip this, close my eyes, and just ponder what exactly it is that this beer reminds me of...maybe ill never figure it out! And maybe there lies the intriguing and alluring nature of fine ales such as this. Incrediably drinkable but richly complex, a winning combination in my books!","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

1257,"2008-09-13",3.8,"Appearance is a clear orange to amber hue, head is a huge mass of effervescent foam that mostly sustains, great lacing all over.

Smell is moderate caramel and toasted malts intermixed with fruits, toffee, and light sugar sweetness.

Taste is mostly toast and roast malts, the toffee comes in midway as does slight caramel and bittering hops, finishes dry and malty with a hint of alcohol.

Mouthfeel is light-to-medium bodied, thin and watery texture, mild carbonation.

This is an amazing beer and what I would hold to be an exemplar of the ESB style, alcohol is well-masked and this is well in the the session range.","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"

Aroma of butterscotch, and some very faint grainy malt.  Taste is more the grainy malt than the butterscotch sweetness, but they are both present.  There is also a nice mineral component, as well as the familiar Fullers yeast taste.  I thought this would be a wreck from the nose, but the taste was quite pleasant.

I returned from picking tomatoes and beans from the garden to witness the 22 pound cat on the counter next to my beer with a wet paw.  Fuzzy was busy licking his paw clean as I was finally able to quaff my first taste.  A bit of cat fur aside this was just what I needed last night.  A bold yet reserved beer.  Sure the hops are there in abundance but they still don’t smack you in the face twice and then ask if you want some more zestiness.  This beer stoicly looks at you and says ""Yes?

The nose is of fruity, bready malt backed by grassy, earthy and lightly spicy hops. Light to medium-bodied and creamy with a flinty, mildly dry finish and a touch of hop bitterness to cap things off. Toasty, fruity malt up front, it transitions to a lightly dry finish featuring lightly spicy and earthy hops. The aftertaste lingers just slightly bitter and flinty. This is a very nice session brew, and at 5.9% ABV, what a happy session it could be. Certainly among the best ESBs that Ive sampled, I can see why it has spawned a steady stream of imitators.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

Flavor: caramel malts start, some sweet but not sickly and ephemeral. Quickly dominated for the fruitiness similar to peaches and apricots jam. Some nutty.   A complex, with medium intensity, nice, some astringent and lasting dryness for the variety of hops, with some stone-peaches reminiscences. Chamomile and red-tea notes.

I now understand the potential of an ESB, and what it should truly represent. If, as their label boasts, Fullers have given us the ""original"" ESB, then we are presented with a case of the source never being outstripped by its scions. This beer is incredibly more refined and well-rounded than any American ESB Ive ever had, all of which usually seem (by comparison) to be overly hoppy and bitter simply for the sake of the hops and bitterness. Fullers, on the other hand, utilises the hops and bitterness to a complete-picture end: it gives them a purpose, and a meaning, and has something to say with them. I drank this with an amazing pork tenderloin dish at The Purple Onion Café in Saluda, NC, and the pairing was spot-on.","Tryon, North Carolina, USA","Perm"

1257,"2007-10-02",2.7,"I had never drank that before going to the UK and have not even drank it in the UK. It is now, today, a few weeks after being back that I try this classic for the first time. In the imperial pint, it settles bright and clear amber, rather carbonated and feeding a lasting off-white cover. Slightly vegetal smelling like a beer brewed with adjuncts and then pasteurized. It also seems to be the victim of a light oxidation beginning as the palate feels a bit wet paper reminiscent. The active carbonation accentuates the moderate minerality and gives a kick to a dryness that needed it since the beer is generally quite malt-focused. Toasty maltiness mostly, never venturing into fruitiness, but hinting at a nut or two. Very grainy nature as well and climbing to rum suggestion in its exagerated alcoholic strength, something that many British beers have problems with concealing. Not a bad beer, but not a very good example of a british bitter, the freshness to cask-conditioning is clearly missing.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

The flavours are excellently balanced with a nice hoppiness and maltiness, sweetness and bitterness complementing each other well.  It has a tasty richness and faint floral element, caramel, bread, fruit, nuts, pine and citrus.

Otherwise, It was very handsome: a rich copper-amber color, with streams of small bubbles in the body. It said ""drink me."" The aroma was smoky and a little chocolate-like. Palate fine, not too watery at all. A very rich, bitter flavor, with a strong but not overpowering kick and just the right amount of hops. The tail was bitter and smoky but quite good. I loved this.

""You smell so good"" I heard myself moan. Whats that scent? Apricots, orange blossom and roses? Summer flowers sprinkled with an evening shower? She smelt so sweet, like a toffee apple at the county fair. 
In the dull night of the bar she radiated with a deep copper glow. Glinting. Luminescent.
Her taste was deep, sensual and sweet. Caramel, toffee, nectarine, orange marmalade and raisin danced over by tongue. It was the fullness of the embrace that sustained me. So very complex - she was subconsciously urging me on for more.

1257,"2007-03-19",2.0,"On tap at the Sharp Edge Creekhouse in Pgh, thanks mtoast!  When this is poured into my glass it appears a little darker than your typical pale yellow American lager. It has a big white head full of creamy small and medium size bubbles. The aroma is typical beery yeast but it is just barely there and I also smell something sweet in the background. The feel of this beer is little carbonation even though there are plenty of bubbles streaming within. As an old classic, I was expecting something more in the flavors, seems to be your wonted brew.  I cant seem to find anything really enjoyable about this except that it is a beer. There is very nice lacing on the side of the glass as I drink it down. Average ESB flavors. The finish is that of a medium ale, medium lingering bitterness. Overall this is OK for an ESB but again I was really expecting something special, no pun intended, for such a popular classic beer. No quite as special as Great Divide Hotshot ESB, Stouts Scarlet Lady and Yards Extra Special but on par with Redhook, Speckled Hen, Bass and Whitbread.

1257,"2007-01-14",3.4,"Red and black label, 1 pt. 0.9 fl oz., best by 12-Feb-07.  A brisk pour into a tulip glass yields a crystal clear reddish copper beer, with a one finger, rapidly diminishing head of coarse bubbles.  
The initial aroma is spicy and yeasty, fading quickly with the head to a sweet malty aroma with a suble fruitiness, and then toasted maltiness.  Medium bodied with a subtle but adequate level of carbonation.  There is a definite malty character, accented by a a light roasted caramel note.  A sharp bitter note quickly and briefly strikes, then changes to a dry, edgy, almost acrid bitterness that lasts  just long enough to make me want to repeast the experience with another swallow.  A modest lacing is left on the glass.  I find this a solid and interesting beer, perhaps not one that Ill be racing out to re-purchase, but certainly nothing I would turn down.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Sombeast"

Starts cloyingly sweet and grows gradually bitter (sounds like a lot of grad students I know).  Sweetish caramel with light, generally indistinct fruitiness, though I am pulling out some green apple.  Yeah, Ill go with honey-laced apple cider.  Malty with a nice, unexpected bit of spice in the aftertaste.   Occasionally chewy with a bit of dark earthiness.  They get a good, complex effect out of this hop combination, and a great balance.

(well, I thought I did anyway =P) I figure Ill try something new even though I dont generally enjoy ESBs. Glad I did, this was a pleasant surprise. Its pretty rich for the style; it packs chewy toffee into the flavor yet remains very evenly bodied and doesnt become too sticky or cloying. The hops are great: not too huge (which wouldnt necessarily be bad) but they do add a good twinge to the sweet malty notes. This finishes soft and semi juicy. I could taste a few resemblances between this and their porter.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Appearance: Pours a nice coppery color with red hues. 3 finger tan head. Nice lacing.

Smell: Very sweet and fruity. Some jolly rancher candy and some butteryness in the nose.

Taste: Straightforward and very quaffable. This beer is a pleasure to drink but somehow seemed to be less complex than the on I had on tap at Quips. Toffee malts and gentle English hops make it a decently balanced beer leaning to the sweet side.

Mouthfeel: Medium body, sharp around the edges but remarkable smooth and slightly slick. The finish has a small bite before the mild wave of dry and the mild wave of sweet wash over the palate.

Drinkability: On tap or in the bottle this is one of the easiest drinking beers I have come across. Well done Fullers!

1257,"2006-08-29",3.6,"Bottle. Pours an inviting frothy, bubbly pale tan head that lasted about 1/2 way through the session - pretty good. Deep amber and clear - presentation is perfect for style. Faint malt with butterscotch nose, fruity esters, no hop bouqet. Dissapointing here - expected a floral hop presentation. Flavour is dominated by a rich, malty, borderline caramel sweetness with a distinct dryness from plenty of bittering hops. Again lacking floral or grassy hop complexity that would have taken it to the next level. Touch of caramel in the finish. A well done beer with a malt emphasis and clean bitterness but considering it is the benchmark for the style I am disappointed in the lack of hop character.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","brewgirlca"

The aromas are great. The initial impression is big and fruity, biscuity malts with a note of what Ive been conditioned to think is piney hops. Turns out, its all just honey imparted by the house yeast. This is a very distinctive, sharp aroma.

The flavor is a bit more relaxed. Theres a really nice bitterness with this beer. Its a tad on the strong side for the style, but easy to drink nonetheless. Medium-full bodied with a finish that reminds of mineral water. No worry, this is excellent! Best of style? Ratebeer has it #11, but only 4 legits above it.

The flavors one up the aroma, by avoiding the grape more so.  Big sweet and round malt.  A slight slight roast, definite caramel, rounded out with light floral traditional English hops.  Provides that slight upfront bitterness, mellows out, and then comesback at the end with a bit of alcohol.

Certainly one of the best brews Ive had in awhile -- and it damn well ought to be, at $11 per six-pack!

Speaking of, the finish has caramel and slightly floral bitterness, but it doesnt last too long. Im getting more and more caramel in the aroma and flavor as it warms. Bitterness seems to be increasing as well, but not as much. That slightly metallic/alcohol note is constantly hiding in the background, though it mixes with the other flavors to fool you into thinking it is, in fact, nuttiness.  The only flat out disappointing thing about this beer is the feel, with is too thin (skim milk), and in my opinion, has too much carbonation. Over all, I can see why this is so popular.

The aroma is spicy and herbal with notes of caramel and toffee.  The taste is lightly sweet up front with a toffee maltiness to it.  Interestingly enough this beer seems to be more balanced towards the malt than the London Pride I just had (perhaps this is palate fatigue).  There is a nice fruitiness that compliments the toffee & caramel maltiness; much of the fruitiness is from the slightly citrusy, lemon-like hops with perhaps some hints of currants.  The beers finish is nicely bitter with a lingering herbal hop note.  This is quite tasty, but not as flavorful and hoppy as I remember it being.

1257,"2004-12-29",4.8,"DRAFT: Deep, deep gold in color with a well-sustained, off-white head.  Aroma is distinctly Fullers (more so than the London Pride) with a very solid but elegant caramel malt character and a good dose of Goldings in the aroma.  Sweet, rich almost burnt caramel malt complements the hops and yeast character and finishes the beer into one of the most delicately flavorful and integrated malt and hop finishes in the world.  This beer traverses complexity.  You can actually have several taste sensations at the same time that are separate on the palate or you can absorb it as one great tapestry.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","AlchemistZ"

Toasted malt, sweet toffee and burnt sugar nose with light melon and berry esters and husky, grassy hops. Woody and nutty in the mouth with a mix of brine, tart bitter hops and fruit conserve, mingled with the malts and lightly roasted grains of this reasonably balanced, zesty bitter. Medium-light bodied and spritzy in carbonation it has a flavour all to its own getting away from the standard pub bitters. Finishes off with a long bitter and toffee malt swallow.

1257,"2004-11-28",2.9,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2006 Bottle. Filtered. 5.9% abv.
 Jan, 2003 It starts promising - quite fruity and nutty, but soon fades.  Darkish with some gentle hop bite, but the crude sugar malt tastes too false. [2.6]
 April, 2004: Head to Head with Badgers <a href=Beer-Ratings.asp?BeerID=1013&FanOfID=4383> (2nd place) . The dark amber colour  of a traditional bitter. Creamy toffee malt. Soft mouthfeel - quite pleasant. Hops build into the finish. Quite dusty and earthy. Leaves a good flavour in the mouth. Needs to be served a little cold to get the full toffee flavour. This hasnt fully grabbed me, but its a decent ale. It gets better the more you think about it. [3.1]
 Sept, 2004: The Big Face Off. <a href=Beer-Ratings.asp?BeerID=24312&FanOfID=4383&gt Empire; <a href=Beer-Ratings.asp?BeerID=132&FanOfID=4383>N Brown; <a href=Beer-Ratings.asp?BeerID=34610&FanOfID=4383&gt Ruin; <a href=Beer-Ratings.asp?BeerID=365&FanOfID=4383>S Nevada; and <a href=Beer-Ratings.asp?BeerID=618&FanOfID=4383>H Devil.  4th place. Aroma was quite busy with little features: anchovies, beef, tomatoes soaked in olive oil and vinegar, tobacco, cardboard, coal-tar soap, dark berries, chocolate, staleness. But the whole is less than the parts, and the whole thing is predominantly stale beer even though the BBE is 10 months away. Taste is sweetish up front. Creamy toffee. Metallic, jagged carbonation. Without the carbonation the beer is quite light and watery; bland and lacking in flavours compared with the others. There is, however, an attractive tree bark finish with hints of licorice. [2.9]
Feb, 2005: This beer has to be drunk cold from the fridge to mask the stale flavours. And even then it cant quite hide them. Toffee sweet with sherry stale hops. There are people who actually like this beer bottled - and good luck to them. But to suggest  that such an obviously  pasteurised beer is top quality is to completely misunderstand the whole nature of quality beer. [2.4]
May, 2006 Blind tasting: Strongish. Hoppy. Malty. Smooth toffee. Creamy. Very nice. 
My main complaints about this bottled ESB have centered on the stale notes and the pasteurising process - yet, due to the strength, I didnt pick that up on the blind tasting. Trying it again knowing what Im drinking Im becoming more and more aware of the strong, but stale hops, and the clean and slightly candied malt. Is it prejudice, or an educated focus? [3.0]
Dec, 2006. Blind tasting with Strong Suffolk, Riggwelter and Old Peculier. Last place. Glowing orange amber. Soft vanishing carbonation. Aroma is jam and vanilla ice-cream, pale biscuit, faint chocolate and even fainter herbal citrus. The flavour is somewhat muddled. Some fudge, damp leaves, toffee, a confused bitterness which lingers in the finish. Lack of clarity - the general muddled nature of this beer lets it down.

Clear orange color with a dense white head fed by very good carbonation (especially for an English ale.) Full bodied and full of fruit, caramel and a floral flavor that is reinforced by the aroma while drinking it. A bit of ligering bitterness at the end.

Not nearly as good out of the bottle as it is on tap - indeed, if the draft version was rated separately as it is with some beers it would approach a 5.0! Bottled version has a somewhat faint though pleasant doughy, floral aroma. Thick-bubbled head dissipates quickly but leaves ample lacing. Flavor is quite malty with a touch of cinnamon/cloves and a great hoppy kick in the aftertaste. Still worth the $3.49 for the bottled version, but would like to see the on-tap, unpasteurized version rated separately.

Deep amber, with a thick, light tan head.   Somewhat dark, yet transparent. The aroma is quite full. Slightly caramel like malts and a bit of fruit that Im not sure of.

Balance is what hits first when sampled. The fullness of the palate is very appropriate to the fullness of flavour and the hopping is refreshingly bitter, yet harmonizing well with the malts.

Very nice maltiness, with restrained sweetness. The hoppiness is very appealing to me, but surprises me by reminding me of American brews, a bit like an IPA tamed. Very much what I was hoping for.

Strangely, the hoppiness is very up front, and actually mixes it with the malts in the aftertaste. This might be a top session and great with a lot of foods.

Muddled aroma has an earthy theme and allows me to catch glimpses of damp linen, pepper, light toffee, peaches and tea.  Sometimes it gets a bit salty or catty.  Semi-sweet flavour is softly salty, finishing fruity with peaches and a floral bitterness.  Light tea astringency builds from the first sip.  Medium bodied, watery texture, moderate carbonation...flimsy.  Soft, without intrigue.  

50 cL bottle, pint glass, 50 degrees.  Finally!  The local stores have started carrying this again!  Very large, rocky, frothy, well lasting off-white head is on a clear red-amber body.  Cookie, caramel malt; mostly flowery, but a little piney hops.  Aroma is pretty simple, but quite inviting.  Oh...now thats tasty.  Definitely a malt dominant ESB.  Moderately sweet, lightly bitter flavor becomes a moderately sweet, moderately bitter finish.  No acidity.  Great creamy body, medium weight, soft carbonation.  A highly drinkable ESB.  The bottom line is: I didnt know it until now, but when I thought of what a great pint of ale should taste like, it was this beer.

There's alot of bitterness to this and alot of punch. Very indicitive to the style. This can be a very drinkable beer but the 5.9% sneaks up on you soon after taking many swigs.

This is one of the more bitter ESB’s that I have indulged in; nonetheless, it has medium body, small fizzy head, amber color, heavy hopped aroma, and a dry finish.

Hops are much more evident on the tounge than in the nose. The initial sweetness is quickly subdued by the bitterness of the hops.

The taste was all malt upfront, with heavy emphasis on the carbonation attacking the palate. Very clean finishing however, as most English beers i have found are. Its only in the aftertaste that the true effect of those bittering hops arises. Its actually a very subtle bitterness, highly subdued by the malty content. All i could really pick up were those damn Goldings hops which are everywhere these days. Mildly dry aftertaste but not overdone in any respect.

If you let a wine bottle get warm it is known that the wine is damaged. Due to the fact wine is higher alcohol than beer makes it travel easier and more stable than beer. So why dont beer importers take the same care to handle beer like wine. Because it would cost them money and you would have to pay more. So that is why europeans drink beer made in there hometowns.

super hoppiness (Extra Special BITTER).   This brew pours a clear brownish orange.  The
fully lasting huge creamy off-white head is exceptional with excellent lacing.  The subtle
and balanced nose speaks of toasted cereal, caramel, flowers, perfume, herbs, spruce,
lemon/lime, dough, earth, pear, ginger, and other spices.  The moderate flavor is crisp,
clean, fresh, complex and well balanced.  The long finish is fruity (raisins & dates), flowery, and bitter.

1257,"2001-09-21",4.0,"A well-crafted bitter. Not my favorite style of beer, but of the bunch this is one of my favorytes. A very smooth, clean flavor. Not as hoppy as one would expect.","Canton, Michigan, USA","johnson2020"

1257,"2001-09-19",3.6,"Clear copper color,short-lived head, not a real assertive nose, some malt, some hops.Mmmmm, good. As soon as its in your mouth, the hoppy bitterness is detected, slightly malty,light-medium bodied, finishes witha  bit of lingering bitterness but clean for the most part..this is a nice brew...drinkable...memorble? Ask me in a month..","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
1257,"2001-09-13",4.3,"Excellent brew.  Superb out of the tap, very much like its more successful and palatable UK brother, London Pride.  Drink cool, not cold, to appreciate the flavor.","Katy, Texas, USA","CourageBest"
1257,"2001-09-10",3.6,"Fine beer.  This is probably the ultimate pub beer.  Always good & even better on tap.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","JessterCPA"
1257,"2001-09-05",4.3,"I sorta consider this the archtypical ESB by which to judge all others. Is that too extreme?","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"
1257,"2001-08-25",4.0,"Real good stuff. Strong malt flavor gives way to a whole world of tastes. I get a strong--get this--sense of strawberry icecream on the palate. Very enjoyable, even out of a bottle that was dated best by May 1999 (gotta stop going to that store).","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
1257,"2001-08-24",4.5,"One of the Great Classic Strong Bitters. Phenomenally hoppy aftertaste, esp. when well matured. Avoid the Keg bottled version. It is a very poor shadow of the proper stuff(if you have to drink bottled Fullers try 1845)","London, ","carsten99"
1257,"2001-08-23",2.5,"Near well balanced with the significant bitter besting a heap of malt. This is the opposite of a bright beer with all the flavors reduced to hues. Some oxidation.  Ill look for this on cask next time Im across the pond.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
1257,"2001-08-17",4.0,"There is no reason to be scared away by the bitter designation; this is a wholly satisfying beer, flavorful but not *too* intense, and a perfect introduction to the ESB style.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","baseballguy"
1257,"2001-08-10",5.0,"The best beer I have ever had","Athens, Ohio, USA","Ageers99"
1257,"2001-07-24",3.8,"A very nice ESB. Not overpowering as many bitter ales can be. Copper color, with a light head. Slight sweet smell. Starts out very mild and a slight bitterness builds with warmth. Slightly bland with a light to medium mouthfeel. Very pleasant, yet subdued earthy/malty flavor. Would probably accompany food well.","Philadelphia, USA","fishman"
1257,"2001-07-23",3.6,"Beautiful, dark amber color.  Smooth head with slight lacing. This beer is devoid of sweetness, with a bitter finish that had a strong presence in the back of the throat.  Very little hop flavoring with a grainy, slightly alcoholic aroma.   A pleasant drinking experience.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"

1257,"2001-06-25",4.0,"A classic ale, nice taut head, rich amber appearance smooth and slightly buttery taste with a perfectly balanced hop finish.  A beer to be savored.","Palm Beach Gardens, FL, Florida, USA","blatz"
1257,"2001-06-14",4.2,"Fullers ESB is a classic full-bodied British ale.  A great hearty beer to be drunk with good friends and lots of good food.  A favorite of mine.","Rutland, Vermont, USA","canary dog"
1257,"2001-05-23",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 9, 2004 Rich fruity-malt mixed with nuttiness. Hops and slight bitterness, provide a little tang in the finish as well as a pepper spiciness in the aftertaste.","California, USA","BeerLimey"
1257,"2001-05-13",3.5,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2004 Bottle.  Toasty caramel malt aroma, accented by a fair amount of spicy, herbal and lightly fruity hop.  Medium-dark copper color, clear, with a fine, subsiding head.  Flavor has a pleasant balance of biscuity, toasty, sweet maltiness and the fruity, lightly bitter and spicy hops.  Palate is effervescent and lightly creamy, body is medium-full.  Easily quaffed.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
1257,"2001-03-10",5.0,"This is the best ESB Ive ever had.  Ive had a lot of ESB, but none can compare to the hoppiness and aroma that this beer has, almost a religious experience.  From the 1st to the last sip it remained powerful, almost like it was bottle conditioned, where some beers get that flat taste at the end, Fullers stayed true to itself.  I hear its even better on tap if you get the chance to get it.","Portsmouth, New Hampshire, USA","rosebud"
1257,"2001-03-08",2.8,"If anything a great looking ale. Thick and flat all the way.Assertiveness a bit too much. I was hopping for a lot more.","Lancaster, California, USA","weeicemon"

1257,"2001-01-05",4.1,"Often referred to as the benchmark of the ESB style and deservedly so. A very delicate and floral nose and flavor, yet maintains a strong level of intensity. You know youre drinking a high quality beer. Toasted bread and toffee like malt flavor dominates with the aromatic hops appropriately making their presence known. Not to be missed!","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"
1257,"2000-11-29",4.1,"This is the type of beer that sort of defines beer for me.  I mean, its not trying to be anything else...its just a straight up, mellow, smooth, malty yet hoppy brew.  Very well done.  One of my favorites for sure.","Sandy, Utah, USA","opiate"
1257,"2000-11-24",3.3,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2005 The bottled ESB is almost bland...certainly when compared to American ales.  Vaguely toasty and dry.  The keg version is a little more complex, with the goldings and crystal malt showing through a bit more.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1257,"2000-10-18",4.3,"Delicious. The best bitter that I have had.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","beergirl99"

This is just a great bitter.  Nice rich
