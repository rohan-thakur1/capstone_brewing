Nose is yeasty Harveys: mushroom, rhubarb, fruity, then toffee and caramel, nutty and earthy. Its all in the yeast.

1295,"2013-04-29",3.4,"Cask conditioned	handpump	Market Porter	London	22/04/13.  A mahogany coloured beer with an off-white bubbly head.  Harveys mineral notes with a fruity sweetness.  Medicinal notes,  Not got the bosy Id like but has the Harveys house funk.  Good enough but not a World beater.","Wootton, Northampton, Northamptonshire, ENGLAND","maeib"
1295,"2011-05-07",3.5,"Cask (handpump) at Egham Beer Festival on 23 April 2011. Good rich amber colour -not sure Id call it ruby. Harveys are not always known for piling in the aromatic hops but dont seem to have stinted here. As well as a firm earthy hop presence, theres also a fair amount of sappy, grassy hop character and maybe a light, floral note too. More on the palate than in the aroma. Malt backup if fruity and vaguely nutty. Well balanced, satisfying and very drinkable. Very well put together indeed.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

1295,"2010-05-02",3.7,"Cask at the Royal Oak, Borough, 28th April 2010. I thought Id missed this but Frank at the Royal Oak kindly poured me the best measure he could manage from the end of the barrel. Slightly reddish copper, rather than a full on ruby colour. No head on this sample and there were bits of vegetation floating in it, so I knew I wasnt tasting it at its best to say the least! The nose is sweet and fruity with jam notes. Definitely dryer and heavier than the Sussex Best with the marmalade bite coming through at the finish. In good condition, I can see that this would have been something really special and Im gutted I hadnt been paying more attention to their Twitter and website! Im crossing my fingers that they chose to brew it again next year.","Los Angeles, California, USA","Ethereal"
1295,"2010-04-27",4.1,"A Mes rate. Cask at the Royal Oak.Well following Ians excited text while we were supping keg Abstrakt at the Pony, I knew I had to try this. Where better than in this fantastic Harveys boozer. This was certainly worth the travel. Glorious light mahogany colour with a decent off white. Amazing jam and marmalade aroma with a generous hoppy topping. The flavour is just as special. Imagine a dry hopped Sussex. A beautifully dry hopped Sussex. Not too much, but enough to make it very assertive. Gloriously full and fruity. Plenty of the house bretty character. Stunning finish. Just stunning. Grass and citrus and big fruity madness. An absolute cracker.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
1295,"2010-04-23",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 23, 2011 Cask handpull at The Pilot, Maidstone.  Whilst the rest of the London crew were enjoying the BrewDog Abstrakt event, I was in Maidstone being totally blown away.  This cask had been on for 4 days, so could have been in better condition, hence the 3 for palate but the sweet malts are great.  But the best thing is the dry hopping which gives it a really sharp full hoppy green English hop finish.  So arresting.  Stunnhing.  Even if it is 4 days old, you cant kill the brilliance of this beer.  Utter amazing.  Re-rate Cask handpull at Egham spring festival 2011.   Still hoppy still drinkable as hell just one of my favourite beers.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
