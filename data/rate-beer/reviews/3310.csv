3310,"2014-11-21",4.4,"Multiple pours from the lagering tanks at Beim Gloser, six weeks matured: Deep rusty-orange with some haze. Fat, dense, and creamy cap of froth. Expressive notes of plum jam, sulfur, molasses, rich breadcrust and minerals leap from the glass. Underlying phenols, cookie, honey, haylike pils malt and vibrant Spalt. Notably ""farmy"" as well. Quite rustic with pistachiolike, candyish yeast. Initial sip unleashes a brisk mineralic potency softened by toffee- and breadcrust-laced melanoidins. Remarkable rich-and-bitter interplay gains more depth as deep-seated black-licorice echoes the earthy hop spice. Captivatingly characterful fusion of zippy minerals and biting sulfur. Deeply nutty edges of toast and an ongoing minerally vivacity vitalize the beefy and starchy malt, which drips with sappy and ""meaty"" molasses. ""Long-boil"" maltiness is staggeringly complex, revealing a pastrylike richness alongside a strikingly ""farmy"" quality akin to hay dust. Augmentation of juicy marmalade and residual sugars complement the resoundingly malty base. Lemony acids and bitter fennel seed hoppiness perfectly offset the sweetness. Lusciously malty finish is replete with hearty melanodins, yet the high attenuation yields a snappy cleanness which is further enhanced by a seamless integration of minerals, hop oils, and woody hop spice. Big time terroir character throughout. Without question, one of the earthiest and most breadcrust-rich zoiglbiers in existence. An awe-inspiring creation that showcases a level of purity, honesty, and attention to detail which is an increasingly rare occurrence in much of todays industrialized system. 100% biologique, to boot, which further reflects Martins uncompromising ideals when it comes to brewing. Heck of a beer.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
3310,"2014-09-06",4.5,"From the maturation tanks at Beim Gloser, 6 weeks old. Dark amber-brown body with a creamy off-white head.
Stunning shape. Toasty, nutty, minerallic, rich and savory in the mouth, the aroma and flavor not unlike the crackling burnt edges of artisan bread. Smacking mineral acidity. Flour / bakery / dough / baked crust impression. Frothy, clean, rich, natural carbonation, beefy caramelized malt mouth feel. Peppery, earthy hops. An absolute gem.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

3310,"2006-12-16",3.9,"Draught, at Beim Gloser in Windischeschenbach, October 2006, but fermented at Beim Binner. Hazy amber, thin lasting white head and gentle condition. Gentle spicy peppery nose with touches of yeast and a pleasant underlying caramel maltiness, slight fruitness in the mouth with a balancing dry yeast chalkiness and a sweet toffee note developing with time. Lingering sweet finish with a gentle dry chalky bitterness. Sweeter and darker than the Zoigl from Neuhaus.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
