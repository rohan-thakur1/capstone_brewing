3679,"2016-12-23",3.8,"Shared 750 ml. bottle poured to snifters, showing a darkest brown color with some ruby highlighting at the stem, with a presentable layer of tan foam, and dots & dashes of lacing. The nose was malty, with lurking, barleywine-like alcohol, some roastiness, nuttiness, and dark fruit. Medium+ bodied, with fair carbonation, the taste was similar, with amped sweetness that revealed notes as caramel, brown sugar, barrel induced vanilla, and a bit of maple. Thinned a bit in texture, but supplied a good deal of warmth.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
3679,"2016-11-01",4.1,"Pours a slightly darker golden brown than the 6 month, with less head. Aroma of more vanilla and booze from the bourbon, still the same caramel sweetness. Taste follows, big on the barrel, big on the booze, wow. Cool to do these side by side.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"
3679,"2016-09-19",4.2,"Draft at the Bruery. Aroma of raisin, ripe fruit, bourbon vanilla and hazelnut. Flavor has bourbon, hazelnuts, vanilla, oak, caramel, ripe red fruit and a long finish. Softer than 6 and somewhat better.","NETHERLANDS","MarcoDL"
3679,"2016-06-10",4.2,"From notes. Enjoyed at a little get together at Dougs house on June 08 with Travis and Chris also in attendance. 750 mL bottle opened by Chris. Nothing like a night cap of the Bruery in traditional fashion. The pour is a darker brown color, with hints of light red shining through and a tiny ring of light khaki colored head. I can smell the booze as my glass is being poured. I dont even need to bring it in. The aroma, aside from the booziness, is very complex and good. There is a nice dark fruit blast right up front. The malts come in with a sweeter chocolate and a light caramel right after that. There is a nice lingering vanilla, and decent oakiness before the bourbon and booze control the finish. The flavor is very similar. There is a strong sweet caramel and chocolate malt up front that slowly makes its way through dark fruits and a hint of vanilla before finishing awfully hot and boozy. The complexity is what I really like. Its a little boozy, yes, but its very good. The mouth feel is a little thin and light for a beer of this magnitude. The carbonation is soft, but it just lets the booze dominate and the thinness is very apparent. The aftertaste is sweet malts with a hint of vanilla and a lingering booze.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3679,"2016-01-17",4.4,"750ml bottle pours a dark brown color with a bit of head. Nice balance of the bourbon with toffee and brown sugar. The toffee is more pronounced than the Chronology 6. Richer bourbon flavor. And alcohol not so hot.","California, USA","Bule"
3679,"2016-01-13",3.8,"Bottle. Actually enjoyed this more than the 6-month, which is interesting because I thought that one was almost too heavy on the barrel character. Nevertheless, this beer seems to have more tobacco and cocoa, and less fruitiness. Barrel notes are still huge, but sugar is lower and the overall drinkabilty is improved.","","PartyFowle"
3679,"2015-12-23",4.1,"Had 6 a while back in bottles, and 12 & 18 side by side at The Bruery. Differences enough to notice for sure, but not necessarily score them different (theyre all 4.1 or so).
Similarities in base beer to their AV beer. Barrel is sweet with vanilla and toffee. Theres a bit of a surprising depth in the 18 that wasnt in the 6 or 12, even though they are all what I refer to as diabetes beers. Good bordering on great sippers.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

S- Booze. Booze. And more booze. It stings! Beyond that: Brown apples, raisin bread, vanilla, caramel, anise, cola, bananas and some astringent. 

M- medium to full tacky body with a scent burn. Mild carb.

T- caramel and toffee notes are strong with some peanut brittle. Bruised apples. Middle starts to snow more bourbon, vanilla and plastic Easter chocolate. A light balsamic. Ending is all bitterness and burning. Dry grasses and a little lemon. Some zinc and seltzer.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"

3679,"2015-08-29",3.5,"On tap @ The Bruery. The turbid, lowly carbonated darkish/chestnut colored beer youd expect. Its got a huge barrel character, which isnt surprising either. Lots of bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Sweet maple syrup, caramel, and brown sugar. Lots of dark fruit and some notes of chocolate as well.
