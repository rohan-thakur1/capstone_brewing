3552,"2016-06-21",3.9,"32oz growler in a teku. Pours golden with a small, white head. Aroma of tartness/sourness, some pale malts, light salt, light oak, and some citrusy notes. Flavor of a nice tartness, but a little light and maybe just a hint too much salt. Still nice and refreshing and would like to have this readily available.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"

3552,"2016-06-13",3.7,"On draft at Tired Hands Fermentaria. The pour is a little clear. Its a golden yellow with a thick cap of white head that falls down to a hefty collar and light film. The aroma is good. Tart and juicy with a bit of saltiness that I like. There is a little oakiness present and a tart citrus on the back end. It smells pretty damn good. The flavor is interesting. The salt is perfectly balanced, which is hard to do. There is an initial tartness on this, and then it morphs into a sweet fruitiness. The mouth feel is good. Its just thick enough with a brighter carbonation that just rounds it out beautifully. The aftertaste is sweeter fruit and a strange malt that kind of creeps in. Its really good, and borderline spectacular.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
