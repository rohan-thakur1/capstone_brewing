4050,"2017-06-14",3.7,"Draught at Casa Verde, 5/24/17.Clear, blonde-maize-golden body with a hint of ruddy orange and a medium-sized, white head that fades quickly to cover. Little bit of chill haze, but clear, for the most part.Esters rise up quickly and initially it¬ís very yeast-driven and fruity. Not overly sharp, anyways and not mixing with alcohol. Light juiciness in the form of kumquat, nectarine and ripe apricot with a bit of spicy pineapple perking things up considerably. Not intensely aromatic, but what¬ís there is quite nice (it was also served in a shaker at a Mexican restaurant). Clean.Very fruity in flavor, as well; tons of juicy yellow fruits with a prominent, fresh pineapple-like character. Good maltiness to the texture and quite dry, as Pipeworks is, thankfully. Honey from the malt balances pretty easily. Bitterness lingers on the finish and turns a touch piney and astringent with a bit of alcohol/sharp ester in the mix. Other than that, this is quite nice. Reminds me quite a bit of Zombie Dust, though not as intensely aromatic and clean and crisp as that one.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

4050,"2016-12-14",4.0,"4 pack of cans from Peak Liquor. Packaged on November 16, 2016. It¬ís a pretty clear beer with just a touch of hop haze in the body. Golden in color and with clingy lacing on the glass. Aroma is very fresh, genuine, and assertive. Notes of grapefruit, papaya, orange are here. The body is full enough, but dry and crisp. Not a whole lot of malt character, maybe slightly nutty and bready, hard to tell through the giant hop flavor. Caramel does finally become tastefully apparent halfway through. The finish really brings out some marmalade while grapefruit and tropical fruit notes are persistent. Just a great beer all around. I¬ím not buying the American pale ale nomenclature, though.

Analizando el aspecto de esta cerveza nos encontramos con una corona de espuma delgada, de perlas medianas, muy cristalinas y una retenci√≥n considerable, actividad de carbonataci√≥n tambien bastante visible, el color de este liquido es un amarillo pajizo no muy com√∫n en este estilo, ya que la mayor√≠a presentas colores dorados claros a intensos, aun asi esta dentro del est√°ndar seg√∫n el BJCP, tiene un cuerpo bien nutrido que ya deja marca en el vaso pero no llega a ser pleno.
El aroma es b√°sicamente a toronja, mucha toronja presente cualidad dada por los l√∫pulos americanos, que en este caso el fabricante indica que solo se utilizaron dos el muy famoso Mozaic y Amarillo, se entiende por que sus aromas iniciales son fuertemente cargados a los c√≠tricos, tambien se puede percibir cascara de naranja, pi√±a en menor grado, pasto reci√©n cortado y un ligero dulzor que apenas se asoma por encima del car√°cter del l√∫pulo, su aroma es muy agresivo para una APA y desde que se destapa la lata llegan todos los aromas antes descritos.
El sabor es bastante fuerte, podr√≠an decirme que es una IPA por el buen contenido de amargor y lo creer√≠a, hay mucho car√°cter a toronja, lima, cascara de naranja, en general c√≠tricos muy fuertes, algunas notas herbales, el dulzor si esta presente y si equilibra el amargor, deja una textura resinosa en las mejillas y es muy seca de principio a fin, definitivamente no es una APA para todos los paladares, a mi en lo personal como consumidor de IPA¬ís me agrado bastante, es una Pale Ale muy fuerte que sale de lo convencional y esa sequedad y retrogusto persistente obligan a beberla toda, muy buena cerveza para los que pueden tolerar el amargor y los que gustan de notas c√≠tricas en las cervezas.","MEXICO","Yased"

The flavor profile is quite outstanding. It begins with mosaic hops. The flavors of the nose are there in a blended fashion, but pine/spruce dominates the profile. Grapefruit arrives after the burst of pine/spruce then slowly the tropicals emerge underneath. The middle brings a balanced bitterness that is a blend of grapefruit rind and spruce.

The aroma is sweet bready malt with a little fruit and a bunch of resiny spicy piney hops.

The flavor is sweet brady malt with fruit and a big resiny piney spicy hop finish with good bitterness. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with smooth carbonation.

4050,"2015-12-13",3.7,"Can¬Ö Pours hazy and yellow with a mid-sized, flimsy, white head that diminishes to a small, tight, white collar. The aroma features a medley of citrus and tropical fruits ¬ñ pineapple, grapefruit, honeydew, cantaloupe, mango, passionfruit and honeybell orange with a rumor of muskiness. Silly good. Medium-bodied with jazzy carbonation. The flavor is bright, juicy and fruity. This is a fruit salad of a beer with a nice touch of citrus zest-like bitterness. The bitterness is not at all overbearing. Short, crisp, grassy finish. Dries out a smidge. Wow, finally, someone-somewhere  understands the beauty of balance in a hoppy beer.

Taste is of sweet tropical fruits, mango, pineapple, light pine and some crackery malts. Light to medium bodied with a touch of alcohol. Finishes well blended between sweet and bitter, leaning to the tropical sweet side a touch. This would be very sessionable, but by default, that means it is not too distinctive.

4050,"2015-10-28",3.9,"Citrusy grapefruit hop aroma with a bit of a dank piney hop finish. Taste is full and malty with a nice grapefruit tropical citrus hop forward and a bit of a dry piney finish. Malty but not sticky at all, almost on the light side but with tons of flavor. Balanced and drinkable. Maybe more on the hoppy and dry side than malty but still nicely balanced. Bit of a lemongrass medicinal hop finish that detracts a bit but still a very nice beer.

4050,"2015-02-02",3.6,"Draft on tap at Binnmys Lincoln Park Tasting Room (Chicago, IL). Excited to try an Pipeworks beer with a real ABV. Pours a gently hazed golden amber hue, a gentle dulled fiery glow throughout with subtle haze, frothy whitish head atop stays as a decent ringer, frothy filmy layer with good lacing offered. Aromas show some distinct tropical fruit and kiwi, touches of citrus, florals. Firmer hop slant but not overly resinous, a good cool fruity
vibe grows with grapefruit, guava and tropical elements hitting well. Some bread, cereal grains and florals. Initial is lighter end of the fold in body, cleaner fermentation allows some decent citric and bitter hops to show up. Kiwi, guava and touches of lemon hit the palate. Some gentle florals grow quickly, firmer bitterness rolling into the backend and finish, dank diesel, citric and fruity bitterness grow. A gentle spice, cleaner body really let¬ís these hops triumph, firm Mosaic and some dank hoppy tropical slants take but don¬ít really offer the girth and potency I was expecting. More dank diesel mixes with guava and Mosaic. Finish is bitter, a bit dank and earthy. Decent florals, earth. The hop profile here seems a bit off, I dig the flavors but then it doesn¬ít necessarily follow through for my own tastes as we finish up, diesel laden and dank. While I think the malt base is a killer, mellow and clean offering the hops offer some potency and juicy life up front and trail off a bit as we start to move on. Gets a bit messy back there. Still a very nice offering, a bit soapy and floral. Solid offering, would like to see them narrow in the hops before canning.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
4050,"2015-01-31",3.4,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2015 Draft. Hops are oily and diesel heavy. Malt bill is very simple, seemingly 2row and some crystal malt but very pale and more in the hop water type of beer. I didn¬ít find this beer bitter enough for the alcohol and sweetness level but that¬ís just me - An APA at IPA strength that wasn¬ít very balanced. So clear and crisp. Fermentation was super clean. Just doesn¬ít smell or taste particularly good. Mosaic Promise destroys this. Hopefully they can do some tweaking before this hits canning production. Or not, everyone¬ís going to love it either way.  3.3

Can, the hop use seems to have been tweaked and it¬ís a much smoother / cleaner mosaic character, balance is there now as it doesn¬ít seem too sweet at all. However, the mosaic character has a good dose of that diesel thingy, bit oniony as well, all contributing to a dirty/astringent finish which was the main problem with the draft/beta version. Another issue I have with it still is a personal thing that I don¬ít care for hop water beers. The mosaic hop is so load that it needs balance with a richer base malt. Hence why mosaic promise is so good and is a character you can¬ít get with generic 2 row malts. 3.4","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
