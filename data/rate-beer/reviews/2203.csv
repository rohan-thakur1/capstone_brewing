2203,"2016-10-16",3.1,"Draught pint at The Looking Glass in Janesville, WI, October 12th. Poured a dark somewhat brackish amber with minimal head, though some could be created with a bit of swirling...at first almost not aroma to be ascertained, just a dry husky leaf-like character; with several minutes a bit of caramel malt does come through and some resin...much the same experience in the mouth, with just a dry, dusky and bitter nothingess, but again it improves fairly dramatically with a few minutes sitting, and just enough sweetness comes out, and the ending dryness becomes less harsh. Medium-bodied, fairly strong carbonation. One of the better arguments Ive experienced recently for not serving too cold, this I would have rated in the low 2s after the first couple of sips, but it became quite drinkable (if not among my favorites in the style by any means) in 15 minutes.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

Original Rating (3.5):This is a decent Oktoberfest thats quite drinkable at the expensive of being a little light on flavor. It is a clear orange color w/ a small white head. Its nose is nice and malt--mostly caramel--w/ a hint of floral hops. Taste is on the light side but w/ a similar and pleasant balance of malt and hops as is in the nose. This is a medium bodied beer, just slightly sweet w/ fine but vigorous carbonation. It finishes crisply w/ some lemon zest and sugar lingering on the tongue. This is actually on the strong side for an Oktoberfest, Id say, but it drinks like a much lighter beer, which is a nice change of pace for a style that is frequently oversweet and heavy.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

There is kind of a burnt caramel smell there too. Nice. Immediately the beer has a strong toffee, burnt brown sugar, caramel flavor. There is a lot of big bread flavors..something like a dark rye and a grassiness as well. The beer sticks around on your tongue and roof of your mouth for a while isnt too heavy.

Nice citrusy, kind of mango-y hop nose, some tropical fruit. Faint, but there, along with the caramel malt. Medium body, smooth crisp lighter carbonation. Lightly dry finish. Head fades to nothing. Moderate bitter taste, minimal sweet. Light spice. Hoppy for an oktoberfest, but I like it. 7/2/6/4/13Rerate, 9/16/15: 12oz can, filled 8/05/2015, labeled 5.7%. Mildly hazy amber orange red color. Thin off-white head, leaving decent reaches of lace. Maltier, caramel, and nuttiness, and a bit of vegetable. Moderate sweet taste, light to moderate bitter. Bit of a peppery hop on the end, but not nearly as hoppy as I remember. Medium-plus body. Smooth, kind of soft, lighter carbonation. Mild slick finish. Decent american oktoberfest.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"

2203,"2012-10-20",3.4,"22 oz. bottle served in a mug. Seems pretty appropriate for the beer. 

A: Pours a clear copper color with a one finger height of solid off-white foam forming on the pour. The retention is awesome and it slowly recedes down the the glass leaving some sticky sheets of lace.

S: Lagery yeast and pale malts. A slight dose of caramel with subtle spices. There is a mild hop backing to it, but its far in the periphery. 

T: Caramel and pale malts with a slight spiced backing. Light green hops with some lager yeast and malty sweetness. The finish is clean with a light hint sweetness.

M: Medium bodied with a medium carbonation. Clean finish.

O: A very solid representation of the style, but it doesnt wow me. Very solid malty sweetness and the light hop backing adds another depth of flavor. At 4.99 this a great value and would buy again if i was in the right setting.

Pretty clear bronze color with a smallish white head and some lacing.  Taste is where it really shines.  Lots of caramel, toffee, bread, and some other spices that I couldnt quite put my finger on, but where tasty and unique.  Maybe some coriander and even some other stuff comes through as it warms a bit in your glass.  I will definitely buy more of this and savor it through October.

A light toast with some more floral and fruity hops before this finishes with a light, but defined crisp bitterness that provides a solid balance and light dryness.

Pours a translucent amber/golden brown in color with a small white head. Nose is a solid traditional marzen, there is toasted malt and some breadiness. There is also faint hops and some light spice. The flavor is a little hoppier than I would typically prefer, but it doesnt really detract from the beer. In addition to noble hops, I get toasted malt, some honey, and light spice. Light to medium mouthfeel, light carbonation, no booziness, and a moderate finish. Pretty solid domestic interpretation of a marzen, I will gladly grab another bottle or two of this to enjoy during football season. Great value at $5 for a 22 oz.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"

2203,"2010-10-10",3.5,"Draft on tap at the brewpub during Oktoberfest at Revolution (Chicago, IL). Pours a decent copper hue, some fire to it, a light haze, with a moderate offwhite head atop that dies to a thicker film, laces small. Aromas are bready malts, biscuits, a touch of sweeter toffee. Faint spiciness and a touch of floral hopping. Initial is bready and biscuity malts, a touch of sweeter malts behind, a light floral hopping with a touch of spice. Light dryness into the finish, lingering bready and biscuity malts. Spice really never gets to what Id like it, as it falls back to a bit more bland than Im used to.
