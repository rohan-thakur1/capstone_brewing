Poured a golden, pale, clear color with two fingers of frothy, white head. A few noticeable bubble marks coming up from the bottom of the glass. Average amount of uneven, foamy lacing on the sides of the glass. Above average retention on the top all the way down. (Sight - 3.75)

Smelled a pleasant whiff of sharp red grapefruit, Citra, Amarillo, resin, tangerine, floral, tropical, mango, pineapple, spicy Simcoe and caramel. Reminding me a lot of a Duet or a Keene Idea. (Smell - 4.63)

Taste followed the nose, although not quite as potent. Definitely an Alpine beer, reminding me of some Keene Idea, Duet, San Diego Surprise and Nelson. Got Citra, Amarillo, floral, grapefruit, tangerine rind, rye, light resin, orange zest, tropical, pineapple, caramel and buttery malts. (Taste - 4.25)

Light body. Thin-to-oily texture. Average carbonation. Long, floral finish. (Feel - 4.00)

This was an awesome session IPA, definitely the best one Ive ever had. Great for August and very good for any time. Loved it. (Overall - 4.25)
