1920,"2014-10-05",2.9,"""pretty good floral hoppy aroma on this otherwise average pale ale. light and refreshing, but not too complex, decent malt balance. maybe just a little light on the palate, but nice and fresh on tap.""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
1920,"2014-05-15",3.7,"Excellent pale ale! The Full Moon poured a light amber color with an off-white, sticky, lacing head. This beer is extremely delicious and well-rounded. I tasted lots of dry and floral hops, balanced nicely with some slightly sweet and bready malts. The finish was spicy and bitter, as well. This is a very smooth and drinkable session beer.","Pottstown, Pennsylvania, USA","obxdude10"
1920,"2014-02-09",3.5,"Always a go too beer at the moon, well balanced, the citrus hop to light color malt ratio is spot on, drink many..","Milltown, New Jersey, USA","10Mary5"
1920,"2013-06-20",3.4,"Tap. Pours clear orange with a medium, fizzy white head, medium retention with good lacing. Aroma is pine and citrus hops with biscuit malt. Flavor is moderate hops and bitterness with supporting malt and a dry finish. Medium body and medium carbonation.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"

Flavor of bready and caramel malt with a soapy, floral finish. A little sweet, could stand to be drier but otherwise its tasty with emphasis on floral/perfumy/fruity hops.

1920,"2012-02-24",3.6,"poured from tap at harvest moon into a pint glass. Pours a solid orange color with a nice, but short, head. 

Forward with noticeable hops along with aromas of florals, citrus and oranges. Good complexity, but lacking some depth

medium/full bodied with a very smooth feel. Nice flavors of citrus, oranges and hops

This comes off as more of an IPA than a Pale Ale. A very good beer on the whole though","","Newk"
1920,"2010-07-11",3.1,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a moderate amber-henna-copper, fairly clear and with an off-white head. Flavors are crisp and reasonable. Some juicy hops, only slightly isovaleric and cheesy. Malts are okay, but for me, too heavy on the caramel malt. Alcohols are clean. This fine, but nothing particularly notable, really. Just kind of a middle and average pint of ""ale"", which I guess is what English Pale Ale and this beer are shooting for.  A little too sweet. Continued mediocrity.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1920,"2010-03-14",3.2,"Draft. Pours golden amber with a thin white head. Sweet malty aroma with light floral and citric hops. Well balanced flavor with sweet malt, floral hops, and some lighter citric notes. Pretty good and definitely drinkable.","La Mesa, California, USA","blipp"
1920,"2009-02-27",3.1,"Tap @ the brewpub.    The beer was copper colored with a light haze and almost white head.  the aroma and flavor were matching.  Light amount of citrus and grapefruit with a malty base.  Pretty basic.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
1920,"2008-12-27",3.3,"Poured an amber color with a small, off white head that left light lacing on the glass.  Aroma of citrus fruits, floral hops, caramel malts, and a bit of toast.  Taste of light pine, citrus fruits, caramel, and a lightly bitter finish.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
1920,"2008-06-16",3.1,"Draft, at the bar.   A solid Pale Ale, good hop character and none of the soapy taste often found in this style.  Poured sonewht cloudy, though thats not an issue with me (highly hopped beers in these environments are often cloudy).  A bit more age on it may help the overall palate, but its damned good as it is.  A solid beer.","New Jersey, USA","peepthesot"
1920,"2008-05-28",3.5,"Draft sample at brewpub.  Pours copper with white head.  Nose is floral hops and caramel.  Good lacing for a draft sample.  No wonder this is top rated.  Great hop/malt balance, maybe a bit too sweet, but not really, hops are floral and slightly earthy.  Great session beer.  Would drink a lot of it.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","dpjuart"
1920,"2007-08-03",2.3,"A reddish colored pale ale?  I honestly had to ask the bartender if I wasnt served their Irish Red by mistake.  The flavors were mild and the mouthfeel was on the thinner side of the spectrum.  Carbonation wasnt high enough for my tastes, and neither was the hop presence, although the aroma was originally leading me to believe differently.  If youre thinking that I wasnt really impressed with this, youd be correct.  Id still think I was served the Irish Red by mistake, but the barkeep gave me a sample and that was even more mundane.","New Jersey, USA","HoppityHop"
1920,"2007-04-26",3.2,"Dark gold and clear. The hops were the first thing I noticed, but it is a Pale Ale and is true to style. The malt comes in well to balance and remain in the aftertaste.","Verona, New York, USA","Grandpa"
1920,"2007-04-16",3.7,"Clear dark orange, creamy white head.  Nose held notes of toasted caramel, light grapefruit and tangerine.  Well balanced flavors of citrus and earthy hops that lie on a toasted caramel backbone.  Medium bodied, soft carbonation, bittersweet finish.  Quite drinkable...","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"
1920,"2006-12-23",3.2,"Lightly hazed amber body with off-white head.  Aroma is medium sweet, floral/grapefruit, melon, light caramel.  Taste is medium sweet, grapefruit/earthy, melon.  Fairly dry.  Light-medium body, light resin.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
1920,"2006-12-05",3.7,"Hazy copper with no head.  Fairly hoppy aroma.  Excellent hop taste and balance.  This tastes more like an IPA.","Peoples Republic of Athens, Ohio, USA","dkoonce"
1920,"2006-12-01",3.4,"Sampler.  Pours a lightly hazy golden amber with a smaller bubbly white head that left some lacing.  Aroma of citrus hops, pretty up front Cascade aroma with a nicely rounded carmel malt backbone.  Flavor of grapefruit and pine followed by a malty grain and cereal presence and some caramel.  Closer to an American Pale Ale than and English in my opinion.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
1920,"2006-07-22",3.5,"sampler.  Aroma is pretty big for a pale ale, floral hops galore.  Taste is nice and malty with a good balance of hops.  Another good beer from Harvest Moon.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
1920,"2006-05-18",3.2,"Pours translucent amber. Faint floral hop and toasted malt aroma. Initial malt flavor of caramel with some citrus notes. Mildy bitter finish, with some british characteristics. Mouthfeel is a tad thin, but this was good enough to warrant a second.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"
1920,"2006-04-02",3.5,"Tap at the brew pub.  Yellow/golden color with a thick and foamy white head.  Head stayed thick throughout.  Hints of casade hops, caramel, citrus and graitfruit.  Taste was quite smooth with the caramel and casade hops coming through nicely.  This was a pretty solid Pale Ale that I would have again.","Princeton, New Jersey, USA","wnhay"

1920,"2006-01-31",3.8,"Deep gold with decent head that gradually winds down. The hops and malt flavors complement each other without overpowering the palate. Kind of reminds me of the first Sierra Nevada I had when i gave up the big corp beers after college.","USA","bfl13"

1920,"2005-03-21",3.2,"Mild, nondescript malts.  Biscuit middle, slightly piney/citric end.  Drinkable, but doesnt mesh that well.  Resin/biscuit flavors are not in agreement.","Pennsylvania, USA","Probiere"

1920,"2004-09-11",4.0,"Tap at the brewpub. Golden clear, white head. FRESH Cascade? hop aroma. Im pretty sure that that is what was used in this latest batch, anyway. Nice sweet malt balanced by fresh hops. Every brewpub should make a pale ale with hops that are this fresh. Very enjoyable session brew.","Good Beer Bar Deprived, New Jersey, USA","MaiBockAddict"
1920,"2004-05-26",3.3,"Not a big Pale ale, but had a nice balance in malt/hops ratio.  Aroma is primarily hops, but with a malty finish.  Pour had minimal head when it arrived at our table.  Good session beer.","Eastampton, New Jersey, USA","Cornboy"
1920,"2003-09-02",3.3,"This brew is a solid amber color with a medium thin off-white head. Thin lacing. The aroma is lightly floral hops. Medium-bodied with a decent level of hops throughout, as well as a little fruit and malt. The finish is not too bitter but still manages to be somewhat interesting.
