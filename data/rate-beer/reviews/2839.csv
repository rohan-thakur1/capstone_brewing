Pours a lovely hazed copper with a solid quilt of soapy light yellow foam. Smells of plenty of resiny and grapefruity hops with a slight lagered, english malt background. Taste is more malty than I had anticipated and the hops are present, albeit reserved with a very crisp and easy feel. The malt seems slightly oxidized, which would be better complimented with a few more late hop additions. Medium bodied with liberal carb and a slightly slick finish. I like this beer overall, although I dont think it meets the usual standards of the RR lexicon of beers. I would drink this with a simple meal like barley soup.

2839,"2013-10-24",3.6,"Bottle dated 08302013.
Aroma has a nice, sweet, pilsner graininess to it. Very faint esters and sulfur, no diacetyl or hop aroma. 
Pours a slightly cloudy golden color with a moderately thick white head that recedes somewhat quickly but leaves behind moderately large amounts of lacing. No legs. 
Flavor is full of sweet pilsner malt flavor. Moderate bitterness but light spicy hop flavor. Light fruit esters and very faint diacetyl. Slight sulfur note in the finish. Some lingering bitterness notes in the finish as well as some spicy hop notes. 
Mouthfeel is medium light to light bodied with moderate carbonation; very crisp, dry finish. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a nice fresh flavorful pilsner. At almost 2 months old the beer still tastes young with a nice assertive bitterness that helps accentuate the dry finish. I like it but the bitterness is probably a bit strong for the style.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

The beer is mostly clear, with only a mild haze, and appears a light yellow color. The head is insubstantial, measuring less than a quarter inch, even after agitation. Minimal lacing. 

I like the aroma. Bready and malty. Smells like a lager. Nice sourdough bread scents.

Thirst quenching, refreshing, easy to drink. Lots of flavor in a low alcohol, sessionable beer. Malty, with only a subtle sweetness that sneaks in, adding s little something to the bready, lager flavors.

Thin body, but not too. Goes down easy. No trace of alcohol.

Overall, I would like a keg of this at my house next summer.

T - Starts out with some light citrus with some grain and corn. Through the middle, some malt comes through with some yeast esters and a bit of bread. The finish is a mix bread, grain, light citrus, and a touch of earthy hop.

M - Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth and very crisp and refreshing.

D - Very drinkable. Very nice session ale. It is fairly light bodied but does not feel overly empty or watery.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"

Finally, this DRINKS not too unlike a macro, but with a much more finessed balance -- subtly fruity, simply malty, and refreshing.  (#4432, 1/7/2012)","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"

Dry, lightly toasty, husky nose, ton of citrus with a lightly woody sage spice that pulls malt back in, very integrated,  soft with complimentary grass, dry earthy hops. Flavor is doughy malt, lightly dusty with more grain, faintest honey and hop bitterness but right amount, never masking, malt a bit dustier than pilsner but softness is sublime. I would bathe in this.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

2839,"2011-12-12",3.8,"500mL thanks to OaklandBrewer. The pour is a light, crystal clear straw with a thick, white head. Nice retention. Nose is fresh dough, grass, noble hops, biscuity malt. Taste is rich pilsener like dough, biscuit, fresh lemongrass. Extremely soft and sessionable with excellent quenching malt characteristics. Even some herbal hops and sage character. Great stuff, a total surprise that I was expecting to be a stale, cheesy hop bomb. What a treat!","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
2839,"2011-12-11",4.2,"Very lovely herbal hop nose, light doughy malt. The taste is lightly sweet and moderately bitter,  tons of awesome hoppiness,  the malt is doughy and soft.

Aroma is a bit stinky and grassy with a touch of green apple and peach. grassy and slightly bitter flavor with a dry, bready pale malt base. Finishes with lingering grassy bitterness. Seemed a little harsh on the palate at first, like a little too much tannin or acid, but I got used to it. Continental blond ale? Almost lagerish, really. Not bad but not worth the same price as a bottle of Pliny or Pig.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Not overly hoppy, which is good, as the wine grape flavor is definjtely present. Chardonnay perhaps?

2839,"2011-10-30",4.0,"500mL bottle shared at a tasting.  They made it clear this beer should not be aged (why anyone would want to in the first place is silly).  Color is pale clear yellow, very pale.  Has a nice large head.  Aroma is netral hops, maybe a bit apple like and some cut grass.  Flavor is very easy on the palate.  Its very dry and has a soft bitter kick at the end of the throat.  Clean, crisp, and a good hop bitterness.  I really liked it, 8 dollars a sixer would be sweet for this beer.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

The aroma is rather grassy and hoppy with a bready malt base.  The flavor is like a hoppy lager, with pale malt and some graininess and grassy and floral hop notes.  Medium-light body, rather crisp and refreshing.  A good beer if not as exciting as Vinnies other offerings.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

2839,"2011-10-06",3.5,"Bottle thanks to Baker, thanks again! Pour is clear golden with a thin white head.  Aroma is slightly off with notes of funk, fruit, light cookie malt, and distant hints of noble hops.  Really kind of smells like a slightly funky pilsner. Flavor is faint biscuit malt, light notes of hay and grass, and a faintly bready finish with a very light floral hop note. I guess this cannot be called a pilsner because it uses ale yeast, but it is as close as you can get. A very subtle citrusy note does play into the finish as it warms. Crisp and easy to drink. Really grew on me the more I drank it. This would be a great beer to mass produce.  Its got character but you could still sell gallons of it at a baseball game. Im sure that is not the goal of RR, just pointing that out.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"

Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a crisp, smooth mouthfeel. Very nice session beer. However, this seemed way more like a lager than an ale.

Pours a clear straw color with a single-finger white head that went down to a collar fairly-quickly, leaving a bit of lacing behind. The nose carried some light grain and faint floral hops. Really delicate, and getting a bit more pronounced as it warmed. The flavor was nice, striking a nuanced blend between mostly-floral hops and a bit of light pilsner malt.

S: A light citrus note up front, but it fades away surprisingly quickly.  The bulk of the aroma comes in the form of pale malt with a bit of a cracker note to it.  Light lemon zest and grass notes on the back end.

T: The flavor is quite light.  Bread and cracker malt flavors with some floral hops and a light grass.  Very soft bitterness on the finish with some hints of citrus zest throughout the sip.

M: Light bodied with a medium level of carbonation.

2839,"2011-08-27",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2011 500mL bottle, purchased at RR. Im actually kind of skeptical this is an ale at this point (the power of suggestion is strong, and theres a mild fruitiness in here, but the nose is clean and the overall texture and limited ester profile is closer to the HUGE Large Pils...; I dont think they lagered either of these very much, if this is a lager.) Anywho. Pours a deep golden color with some modest haze; small creamy, fine-bubbled off-white head. Crisp, bready and doughy aroma, with a modest mineral and citrus hop profile; predominantly Pils malt and light hopping; generally clean, if a touch of fruitiness that might not be coming from the yeast. Medium body; medium-high carbonation. Lots of toasty Pils malt here, it seems: crisp, bready, doughy, with a nice core bitterness (mineral with edges of citrus); not quite as delicious as the HUGE Large, but plenty of similarities there and both are hugely drinkable. Still having mixed opinions on the yeast, but theres a lightly sulfury note in the nose thats pushing me even more towards lager yeast. It kind of doesnt matter, but youd think one would be able to easily make that distinction; less so with a healthy dose of hops and seemingly minimal filtering and brief lagering time. Thats my guess. Tasty regardless. Medium-length finish: toasty, bready, nicely dry. UPDATE: Vinnie said mixed ale yeast, fermented on the cooler side.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
