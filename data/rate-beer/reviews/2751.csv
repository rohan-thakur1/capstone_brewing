2751,"2012-01-18",3.0,"Draft at the brewpub, Summer 2011.  The pour yields a lightly hazy reddish amber body with a tall, foamy, beige tinted head.  Lasting a good while, the head slowly gives way to thick, broken walls of lacing.  Aromas are based in moderately caramelized cereal grain, touching on some mineral character, and showing just a flash of floral hoppiness.  The flavor offers up a surprising bit of crisp acidity that cuts through the caramel sugars and cereal, allowing for the floral hops to press forward and assert themselves a bit more.  On the palate, a light to moderate body sports lively carbonation and the aforementioned acidic crispness on the finish.  Still, theres really not a ton going on here.  Its a decent amber lager, but it pales in comparison to others within the region.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

2751,"2011-05-16",3.8,"Pours a bright orange with a big white head and some lace. The aroma is earthy and mildly malty with some nice spicy hoppiness and some rose like floral character. The flavor is bursting with bright maltiness and there is an underbelly of earthy bitterness throughout. The horehound note shows up nicely in this which makes me think Marzen. The spiciness of the hops seems to intensify as the glass goes down. The mouthfeel is a little bit sharp but also a tad thin. Very nice lager beer indeed.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

How: Tap at brewpub (Klásterní Pivovar Strahov, Prague)
The look: Partly cloudy dark-golden body with a large off-white head
To me a typical Czech Polotmavé (Czech Amber Lagers) is: Hay and biscuit wrapped in caramel.  Very light fruity notes with no specific fruits giving the impression of slightly fruity caramel.  Moderately sweet.  Sweetness is well balanced by dry grassy hops.  Body is smooth.  Medium carbonation.
This one: As above but with less caramel and more Saaz hopping than average for the style making it feel halfway between a Svelté (Czech Pilsner) and a Polotmavé.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

I hadn't reckoned on a microbrewery, but here it was. The advertising board outside said light, amber or dark, as per the standard Czech notation, but it did also say 12, 13 or 14%, rather than the usual symbol for degrees... Now thinking of Belgium, and being in a monastery brewery, I wondered what I was letting myself in for when I ordered an Amber, especially given I still had lots of walking to do in the day! When it arrived it looked like a Rogue beer, deep toffee colour, with a massive, fluffy, beige head. Sweet and biscuity aroma. Sweet and balanced through most of the swig, becoming stronger and more herbal on the finish.
