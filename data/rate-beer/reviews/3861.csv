3861,"2017-06-02",4.3,"This beer has such a strange relationship with my palate. It tastes disgusting at first but its so refreshing and I keep drinking it,the after taste it the only bad part but if you keep drinking it,then its delicious. The only unpleasant part about it is the one second after taste, I eventually got used to it but I still know that I dont like it. Everything else about it is great and I understand that the after taste is part of the overall beer and it wouldnt work without it. This is one of my favorite beers and most definitely my favorite IPA. IPAs are cool right now,so everyone is making crappy IPAs to fit in, but this is an IPA done right and I feel that it has been crafted with passion.","","Besh"

3861,"2017-03-20",5.0,"Pour: Golden orange amber. Head is a creamy white with beautiful lacing. It looks like your grandmothers doily.

Bouquet: Clementine citrus, raw sugar, piney, and floral hops.

The Sip: Toasted malt notes start off and fade into the hops. These herbal and floral hops spring up through the malt notes and burst citrus onto the scene. There is a nice hop bitterness which cleanses the palate of the malt makes Sculpin very well balance. Sculpin reminds me of apricot jam, orange-marmalade, light creamy malts. Toasted bread. Deep resin.

Mouth-Feel: Small, sharp carbonation. Medium body. Tart pucker on finish.

Overall: Exceptional. An intensely complex IPA. Flavor notes are deeply layered, and very well balanced.

Looks: Clear golden orange colour; One-quarter finger head with soapy white foam which fades in 15 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with active carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant Ale malt, with apricots, strong mangoes, peaches, candied fruits, grapefruit pulps, floral nectar, sugar, pine, resins, spices, biscuits, lemon peel and grass. Very subtle! 

Taste: Close to medium sweet Ale malt, with grapefruits, light candied fruits, floral, fructose, pine, fair resins, strong herbs, spices, dry biscuits, lime, strong bitter hops and strong fresh grass.

Body: Mid to full body; Thick, creamy and oozy palate.

Mouth Feel: Full Ale maltyness in a thick background, rich and very smooth. Strong but subtle hops with moderate grapefruits and touches of candied fruits, very grassy herbs, pine and light ooze. Flowery with fair fructose sweetness. Biscuity with lime to round. Very balanced and nice!

Hoppiness: Apricots, mangoes, peaches, candied fruits, grapefruits, floral nectar, pine, resins, spices, lemon peel and grass in nose. Citrus, light candied fruits, floral, pine, ooze, strong herbs, spices, lime, and fresh grass in taste; Bitterness is quite strong for a lasting, mid to high astringent bitter sweet malty finish.

After taste: Fairly dry. Citrusy, herbal and nice strong bitter to mouth.

Comments:This one is strongly hopped for sure, but what is so good about it is the subtely in both aroma and taste - the yellow and citrus fruityness is juicy, with with well-noted pine and resins but never over the top. Very herbal grassy but the bitterness is mild and, breezy and refreshing. Its sweetness is fruity not sugary. I can go on, but you get the picture: this is a very well-balanced west coast IPA.

Bouquet: Clementine citrus, raw sugar, piney, and floral hops.

The Sip: Toasted malt notes start off and fade into the hops. These herbal and floral hops spring up through the malt notes and burst citrus onto the scene. There is a nice hop bitterness which cleanses the palate of the malt makes Sculpin very well balance. Sculpin reminds me of apricot jam, orange-marmalade, light creamy malts. Toasted bread. Deep resin.

Mouth-Feel: Small, sharp carbonation. Medium body. Tart pucker on finish.

Nose has beautiful flavors of fresh yellow grapefruit peel.  This is not just the zest, but the entire peel with  the tartness of the zest with the more organic sweetness of the white rind.  There are some nice sweet deep roasted malt aromas coming off this thing as well.  Finally, there are some nice pine and fresh grassy aroma notes as well.  There is a molasses sweetness to the nose as well.  Very Very Very pleasing!

Mouthfeel is soapy, sudsy and very very well represented by roasty malty flavors, with graham cracker fullness, caramel sweetness and a roasted hazelnut nuttiness.  There is even a brief pecan butteriness if youre not distracted by the hops

The hops are resinous, piney and pronounced.  You get the same taste experience chawing on a fresh yellow grapefruit peel. Just so so so beautiful.

Intense and powerful hoppy aroma, a real hop perfume. Notes of grapefruit, ice-cream bean, lemongrass, cedar, green apples, rose apple, pine cones and even basil. Really great, purely hoppy. Taste is very bitter, intense and bold without being a hop-juice. Herbal bitterness leaves some space for soft to mild fruit tartness to be perceivable. An all hop brew, with barely any malty hints. I can say, in a hop-head mood, I love it and see little ground to improve it, but its not the pinnacle of complexity. Medium body and carbonation. Very very drinkable and admirably brewed.

3861,"2015-08-01",4.4,"During my random down time beeresearch I noticed that the last IPA rating I did (La Cumbre), allowed it to leapfrog in the ratings over this locally available beer, that much to my surprise i havent rated. To be honest, Im not sure if Ive even ever had it before. I always have jumped at the opportunity to get the grapefruit and habenero, but this one always slipped through the cracks I guess. Who watches the sequels, but never bothers with the original? Apparently I do. The originals are always better right? I havent seen The Godfather in a while. Or was that the one exception? Oh yeah, the beer. 12 oz can purchased entirely for the comparison, and to give it the chance to earn its spot back. I have no doubts, because these guys dont really miss with their beer often. Pours a fizzy golden color with a huge sea foam head. Aroma has a huge splash of grapefruit and citrus, from a distance. Kinda filled the area, which was very nice. Very nice grapefruit, and orange fruit fronted flavor with an excellent hop character throughout. Long cool, lemon citrus like finish. Fantastic IPA to say the least. Another that deserves the hype that surrounds it. It almost seems to me like the sculpin has as much grapefruit as the grapefruit version does. Would love to compare side by side.

Smells of biscuity malts, with a hoppiness featuring a grassy dankness as well as an orange ripeness. While the hops are beautifully well pronounced on the nose, they blend well into the malts with a note of lemon zest standing out from that mixture. 

Drinks outstandingly soft, with a well integrated aqueous note, perfectly covered by pungent hops, creating a fantastic refreshment.

Begins with bready malts, together with a short appearing coppery note, integrated into the overall taste by sun-bathed, sweet oranges. They introduce an exuberant fruit note to the palate, covered by dry, bitter lemon, pushed by a slightly metallic carbonation. Finishes with luscious lemon rind, leafes, a sparkly burn and a dried orange.

Convinces by a world-class balance between sweeter malts and distinct hops, which blend marvelously well together. The hops provide an awesome flavor profile, around which the flavors are successfully build, exhibiting a great depth","GERMANY","aleigator"

3861,"2015-07-12",4.1,"One Ive been waiting to try for some time. News of a fresh batch hitting Perth and off I go! At just on cool and into a snifter it goes. Hazy, deep orange with a radiance that is embellished by the first sun weve seen here in weeks. Head is a soapy mess of white that daubs a thick lace. Nose is on the drier side initially just ceding pine and resin but then from out the blue comes soft and rounded, ripe tropical fruits like guava and mango, honeydew and cantaloupe. There is a touch of banana in there too to make it seemingly sticky. On the palate it is delicate, quaint, and almost mysterious. Softly spoken but there is ample going on. Supple fruit like the nose placed at intricate intervals on the palate so that it pops just enough to keep you guessing. There is a touch of honey upfront, clean, amongst some biscuity malt. No interest in offering up the alcohol it drinks like a 4.0 per center. Creamy in mouthfeel with a resinous, fruity aftertaste that lasts. Bitterness matches the fruit and balances the malt. As it warms there is a fruity sweetness that lasts and contrasts the resin and pine of the nose. This is just simple session stuff.

Maussa pihkaisuus jatkuu, mutta nyt rinnalle tulee puumaisuutta, hedelmää ei ole. Keksiyyttäkin löytyy hieman, tällä kertaa se ei ole vohvelimaisuuden kaltaista vaan viljaisempaa. Suutuntumassa katkero puree vielä jonkin verran ja muuten tuntuma on äärimmäisen kuiva, kuten kuuluukin. Hieno ja monipuolinen tuoksu maun ollessa suoraviivaisempi.

Aromas of wet Spring grass, grapefruit zest,artichokes, damp newspaper, and krill oil.

Smell is sweet and faintly bitter. Palate has slightly unripe mango, apricot, orange and grapefruit peel, something not quite pine (kumquat?). A bit of tropical/berry sweetness and pale malt in the middle. On the finish, moderate-high citrus pith bitterness, astringent, a hint of grain the only real flaw for me.

Taste: Light bready malt that quickly turns to sharp bitterness and dank, resinous, earthy hop flavors. Grapefruit and grassiness is there, but very low. 
Mouthfeel: Light to medium body with a medium-high carbonation
Finish: Seems to balance well on the finish, with only a slight lingering bitterness. It does leave a sticky resin on the tongue. 
Overall: Well done west coast IPA that has a great aroma, with a dominant hop bitterness that doesnt overpower thru the finish. Fairly light malt base that lets the hops shine but still remains balanced.","","TH28"

Have been waiting to try this for ages, as their Big Eye IPA is both a regular and a big fave of mine. The aroma is exquisite, with lots of caramel malt and fruity, piney hops. In the mouth, theres a big caramel malt backbone with some toffee, masses of tropical, stone fruit and citrus fruit (mango, peach, apricot, mandarin, grapefruit), marmalade, and big dry resiny hops. The palate is a little syrupy with average carbonation. This is a truly wonderful IPA which is difficult to fault. To me, its only subtly different to Big Eye - a little sweeter, smoother and ever so slightly less aggressive. Perhaps a touch more enjoyable, but only just. Rating 4.5

Re-rate on 22/8/2016 (355ml bottle). Certainly a top flight IPA, but on revisiting after drinking lots of Big Eye, Ive  concluded that I actually prefer the latter.

There is a lot of tropical fruits and a malty hop presence. The pineapple and tangerine really pop through, but it's not overly done. The maltiness is a little surprising here. The flavor is much more malt forward than I was expecting. The fruits and hoppiness are really relaxed, letting the malts control it. There is a light bitterness on the back end. The mouth feel is really good. The carbonation is a little light, so it does fall off of the palate pretty quick. The aftertaste is really malty and dank, not really bright and hoppy as I would like to see. Not bad by any means, but it could be better, for sure

3861,"2014-11-27",4.5,"This is a great beer if you like something between an IPA or double IPA style. It is fresh, crisp and fully hopped. This beer is less malty than some of my favorites. Funny thing is that it did not taste terribly strong either, but at 7% it is definitely an IPA but perhaps shy of some double IPAs. I have no criticism. The high attenuation of this brew lends itself to higher alcohol than an IPA, but less sweet and malty product than many IPA or doubles. It seems to cleanse my palate rather than saturate and overwhelm it with sticky sweet nectar. It is very good. I dont think it deserves a 100 rating, but beauty is in the taste buds of the beholder. Ive recently rated the Odell Myrcenary Double (9%) and Green Flash W Coast IPA (7%), which Ive recently loved. This double is definitely not as sweet or sticky as another favorite, Great Divides Titan IPA (7%). Several Mid American IPAs Ive tried in Kansas and Nebraska lately have had off flavors that I believe may have resulted from wimpy to nasty tasting hopping. I keep finding myself returning to Rocky Mountain and West Coast ales that satisfy. This is a top IPA in my book, but one possessing a lower residual gravity and malty character.

Rated this side-by-side with the Big Eye IPA, which is also 7.0% and in the same style. The differences are significant, however...this has almost no aroma, which is strange for an American IPA, but its much better balanced in the mouth. Big Eye is an abrasive, astringent, crude west-coast resin bomb, whereas this is more British-styled, like a really high-ABV Bitter. It would be well enough if this was 4.0%, since it would be usable as a mindless session beer...but with all this booze and the lack of an enticing nose, its not really suited for either sipping or quaffing. So, pretty much the same score as Big Eye but for different reasons.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

 Poured from the bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance- The beer pours an orange-amber color with a one finger foamy white head. The head fades over a moderate level of time leaving a very persistent foam on the top of the brew as well as some foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is rather sweet with lots of tropical fruits of mango, pineapple, and tangerine, accompanied by some caramel sweetness as well. With these aromas is a lighter hop aroma of grapefruit and a little bit of pine.

 Taste  The taste begins with a lighter sweet flavor of tangerine and tropical fruits mixed with a cracker and biscuit flavor. The biscuit and cracker create a base for the brew, lasting throughout the entire taste. The tangerine and tropical sweetness fades however, leaving a much drier taste at the end. Initially the taste is smoother with only a little hop bitterness of a more grassy and grapefruit nature. As the taste moves on, and the sweetness fades, the hop gets more bitter as other hop flavors of a pine nature joining in. The grassy and pine flavors take on the bulk of the hop flavor as they increase to the end, leaving a rather bitter and dry flavor on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average side in its thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is rather average. The mouthfeel is rather nice for the crisper and drier flavors of the brew all while keeping the hop flavors well supported.

 Overall Starts out sweeter and finishes a bit drier and more bitter. A rather tasty IPA.","","Darkmagus82"

Immediately I smell tropical fruit aromas as I pour. Upon further inspection I can detect bright mango, pineapple, and bubblegum. Real nice and fruity. When finally tasting the beer I first note an immediate piney hop bitterness that is quickly met with the tropical flavors detected in the aroma. The resinous qualities of this beer come back just as quickly as they faded and mix with a somewhat restrained caramel malt. Very nice.

Chewy texture, good weight on the palate yet without alluding to its abv, carbonation is soft and creamy.
Palate hits hard with plenty of resiny hops, bitter citrus, green stonefruits and woody spice.

3861,"2014-07-23",4.1,"{from notes based on a growler consumed Feb. 2012).
Pours an orange-amber with a very slight haze and a smallish off-white head. 

Exceptionally fruity aroma, featuring oranges and other citrus fruits. Some caramel here too. In fact, the aroma seems markedly sweet. Still, this much hop aroma can indicate a rather bitter brew; such is not the case here. The flavor is actually rather tame for style since theres plenty of sweet malt to partially counter the hop bitterness. No question, however, that this leans to the bitter side, as it should, and eventually one is left with an aftertaste consisting of hoppy, grapefruit bitterness. The premier feature of this IPA, however, is the powerfully fruity aroma and flavor. This actually tastes like it was somehow made with a citrus punch featuring tangerines. [Citra hops?] 

M: very smooth; medium body; light harshness/bite from 7% ABV which is otherwise not evident in tasting. 

O: an outstanding IPA for those who, like me, are particularly fond of a citrusy IPA.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

Resin is upfront and then various fruits evident. Complex - with a 4 or five citrus (after the hop resin) then tropical flavors - most obvious being passion-fruit, giving way to some subtle flavors further down the track (with of course some bitternessity!). I dont normally comment on Mouth feel - because it normally feels like there is just some beer in my mouth - but this I get - the tight little bubbles I mentioned earlier - give this a lightness on the tongue - and the beer dissolves quickly on the back of this - leaving the above tastes to linger.

Smell: There is a bid hop presence here with loads of citrusy and piney hop notes.
Taste / Palate: The first few sips I mostly got loads of pine like and some citrusy grapefruit and lemon rind flavor notes. As I drank on and the beer warms more peach like fruit notes and maltiness comes out. The finish is all hop bitterness which lingers for some time.

Hoppy taste, very bitter from the very first sip all the way to the aftertaste, lots of pine, orange peel, citrus, tropical fruits on the finish, kumquats, fresh grass.

3861,"2014-06-10",4.9,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2015 Hell yeah. Ballast Points ale tastes every bit as aggressive as a West Coast IPA should, yet it has more balance than some of its peers. The aromas and flavors meld together with pine, spruce, grapefruit, resin, and the subtle juiciness of overripe tropical fruits. The balance between malts and hops is fantastic. You get just a hint of biscuit taste among the bitterness. Theres also a note of earthy, grassy sweetness.

Taste is more apricot, a touch of citrus and some soft caramel malt. Grapefruit-rind bitterness creeps forward and punctuates the moreish medium-bitter finish. 

My only small qualm is the palate. It feels slightly diluted. Perhaps carbonation needs better integration. My preference is for more creamy IPAs but the filp-side is this mouth-feel suits a more refreshing feel.

I don't find this beer to be outstanding in any one area, and yet it is very good in all areas. The balance of citrus and sweet, with bitterness and malty dryness is fantastic. The beer is not heavy but does have a thickness towards the end, as the grapefruit-rind bitterness sneaks out and spreads into a thin, yet ever-present layer of ending flavor.

Light honeyed maltiness sits in the background and the beer is clean and free of alcohol vapors. Aroma strength is high and eminently sniffable.The flavor, however, is where it shines even more. That same unique yellow fruits-meets-light citrus, with a strong, but not overwhelming bitterness and quite a bit of maltiness to balance. The peach-apricot flavor slowly turns in to the citrus-pine flavor, and not until the end, which I thought was the best part of the beer. Plus, the hop flavor is very very rich and fresh. Mouthfeel is probably the weakest link. Although its substantially malty, the lack of bottle conditioning makes it a touch watery/loose. Still, a phenomenal beer when you thought its all been done in the IPA category. 8/3/9/4/18Fresh on draught, late 2013Hmmm, Ive had this two or three times now, looking for the experience of having the original batches but it keeps coming up very short. Of course, hop availability changes, and even moreso, hop quality varies from year to year, but these drafts didnt seem any where near what it used to be. Lots more piney bitterness, not overwhelming, but still quite forceful. Too much sweetness and actually too much body. Just seems like a forceful, classless double IPA with tons of malt and hop acid. Sharp and biting on the finish, with some alcohol sting/burn, as well. Still some traces of the peachy-apricot notes, but nothing like I remember.

3861,"2014-02-04",4.5,"Pours a golden honey color with a frothy cream-colored head. Nice retention and great lacing. Aroma is apricot, pineapple, honey, peach, tangerine, and floral notes; a pleasant aroma thats very inviting. This beer is very crisp and refreshing. Flavor starts off with nice sweet citrusy notes, tangerine, mango, and pineapple, followed up by the perfect amount of hoppiness and spice as it lingers on the tongue. This is as perfectly balanced an IPA Ive ever had. Mouthfeel is thinner than youd expect for an IPA with this flavor profile. Usually they are a little on the thicker and more syrupy side. This one isnt, and thats not a bad thing at all. Its perfectly carbonated and the thinner mouthfeel just adds to the experience as its plays off that crisp and refreshing aspect of the beer that makes it a homerun in the aroma and flavor department. Overall this might very well be the best IPA Ive ever tried. Its different than I expected, but in a very good way. I love this beer. If you like IPAs, this is a must buy.","Georgia, USA","dunn4040"

A - Brassy golden body, crystal clear, firm 2 finger off-white head. Textbook retention and lacing showing off.

S - Awesome bouquet of citrus aroma. Grapefruit, apricot, spicy, light bready malt. Yeast comes out more as it sets. The aroma is spot on. A harmonious balance of hops, yeast and malt.

T - Spicy grapefruit bitterness right off the top. Bright and clean. Sweet and bitter grapefruit flesh morphs into resinous grapefruit rind bitterness toward the end. Citrus, pineapple, and, stone unripened stone fruit dominate the palate. It has a simple sweetness that plays off the hops wonderfully. Semi grainy malts add just enough backbone to support the strong citrus hops. Finishes crisp and clean with a long bitter aftertaste.

M - Medium full body, low to medium carbonation, smooth with a very clean finish.

This might be the best IPA Ive had to date. It is clean, precise, and executed almost flawlessly. Its bursting with hop flavor and bitterness without being over the top which is hard to come by. The layering of flavors are very impressive. As of right now this is my favorite IPA to date. This 6pack was 15.99 but worth every penny.

3861,"2013-10-05",4.3,"Canned 6/26/13 and picked up at The Beer Temple in Chicago. Oh, how Im looking forward to this...

Appearance: Pours with a massive four finger soapy head that stays for quite awhile. Sculpin has a pretty clear light amber color. The lacing is fantastic. Excellent looking IPA.

Smell: Grass and peaches are the two things that I get most. There is also a slight citrus note in there as well. Really does smell nice.

Taste: Quite a lot like the aroma, really. Kind of tastes like a ripe peach at first, and the medium feel of Sculpin gives that impression even more. Theres then a bitterness on the middle of the tongue, with a sticky, dry, piney and bitter finish. The aftertaste is just lingering pine and peach bitterness that I love. Sculpins an excellent name for this IPA, especially as it warms up. After being out for about ten minutes, the bitterness intensifies, and the alcohol becomes traceable. 

Canned and put onto my tastebuds here in Michigan just 12 days later. A six-pack ran me $14 or $15, which is definitely kind of steep (considering I can get a sixer of Two Hearted for $10), but this has an excellent bitter pine and peach flavor that I thoroughly enjoy.

3861,"2013-09-23",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2015 Update:  First time out of a can.  Should be pretty fresh - just hit Rum River today.  No doubt this is a quality IPA, but I had it slightly overrated.  Aroma is solid before the head fades, but that goes quick.  -1 Aroma, -1 Appearance, -2 overall.  

Update:  The middle is a bitterness that you have to endure just slightly to make it to the more mellow aftertaste.  Aroma is where this beer shines.  Taste is very good but doesnt quite live up.  Clean, sharp, crisp, bitter hops with a sugar cookie kind of sweetness to the malts, both in aroma and up-front taste.  No date on bottles, and I hate docking points when I dont know the freshness.  This bottle is fresh from a new liquor store, so I feel OK with the re-rate.
On tap @ Muddy Pig. Pours a clear light amber with lasting ring of head and awesome lacing. Aroma is off the charts with grapefruit, mango, and pineapple. Taste is citrus with some pine, and very low on malt. This is crisp and bitter, a pure and simple IPA with an insanely smooth palate.   Furious has a bit more malt balance, but stays more aggressive with a sharper, meatier bitterness at the expense of a little smoothness.  Sculpin has a clean and pure malt-less bitterness that allows the hops to stand alone, all while somehow staying medium-bodied and smooth.

3861,"2013-09-06",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 18, 2013 Poured from a 12oz bottle to a tulip. Truly from the time you open the bottle Sculpin reveals itself as something special. The aroma bursts forth from the tulip. Citrus and stone fruit come to the fore. The earthy hops and even a tinge of cat pee funk linger underneath. Intriguing, this is absolutely one of the best smelling IPAS out there. The appearance is beautiful in its simplicity and clarity. Pours like a medium colored lager with a minimumal white head. The carbonation is light. The taste is an explosion of strong grapefruit and lemony citrus hops. The front of the tongue is awash in juicy hop flavor and bitterness. A mild  rock candy like sweetness hits in mid swallow before the bitterness returns on the finish. Yowza!  This brew really is a marvel! It is well deserved of the accolades heaped upon it. One nosing, one sip and one swallow and youll know youre in for a game changer. Im editing this review to reflect that in my area (Twin Cities) I can find this right at $9.99 a six pack. Ive seen several post that call Sculpin pricey but here at least its the same as other staples in my rotation such as Bells Two Hearted, or Odells and cheaper per ounce than Stone IPA or Surly Furious.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","TheMaha"

It consists of grapefruit, peach, pineapple, mango, apricot, with some mild pine notes. All impressions are balanced very well. The taste contains much more citrus fruits than your typical IPA. Many of the initial impressions remain, especially grapefruit, peach, and apricot. The pine still balances things out and is noticed more at the end. There is a very good, bitter hoppy kick that this one delivers. Strong and lingering aftertaste is mostly pine with some more mild citrus.

It has a bitter finish when compared to Pliny the Elder and Lagunitas beers (which I also had tonight).

3861,"2013-06-10",4.2,"12 ounce bottle divided into tulip glasses. Im glad to see this distributed in the Chicago market in the past few weeks. Its the gold standard, in my mind, for the single ipa style. Ive benefitted from a fresh bottle, less than a month old, so the hops were at their juicy finest. Slightly herbaceous and veggie in character, and those hops pair up deliciously in a non-citrus sort of way. Medium bodied, ruby red, good amount of bubble and foam presence.  At 7% abv, theyve crafted a finely balanced ipa that you can drink without knocking out your senses nor your tastebuds. If you havent tried this one, its worth hunting down.","Illinois, USA","brian60625"

Peaches too.  The malt is really captivating me and I love malt.  Taste is scrumptious. It drinks light and fruity and like iced tea.  Body is supple but not biting, carbonation is ample but soft.  The malt is so smooth and offers plenty of bread and a little cracker.  It doesnt outshine the hops though which remain delicate as the fruit takes over the palate. Its juicy and sweet.   It isnt too oily or resinous but it has a good bitter and it its almost dry but not quite.  It has perfect balance and it isnt too sweet and the bitter isnt all there is.

3861,"2013-05-08",3.8,"A great straw colored IPA with thin and quickly dissipating head.

Nose and flavor do not disappoint with great hoppy bite in some of the more floral hop varieties.

Malts still come through cleanly, making this a great drinkable beer, but perhaps lacks some of the depth or interest of other iPAs.  Nonetheless, Ballast Point has a great brew here with durability through the seasons, with enough character for fall and a clean and effervescent mouthfeel to deliver through the summer.  Cheers!

I was so excited to try this beer! Great ratings.... picture of a sculpin (my wife totally takes care of them at the aquarium!) IPA, Ballast Point!!! But this beer was pretty disappointing. It wasnt bad but it wasnt good either. A little uncontrolled... doesnt bring anything special to the table. The Big Eye IPA and the Calico Amber were way way better.

It is somewhat well balanced, it has very low malt undertones, almost so little malt its undetectable. The first taste you notice is the bite of the almost overpowering hops, for such a low alcohol content ipa, after holding it in your mouth a second or two you will get a slight tropical fruity flavor followed by a finishing note of pine. Dont get me wrong this isnt a bad beer but there are definitely better and this one is not worth the money at 15 bucks a sixer. Im not a beer connoisseur I just like good strong ipas and imperials that taste good and get me drunk. For me taste comes first but I usually wont buy it unless it has a abv of 8.0 or higher. If u want a beer like that try Lagunitas Maximus ipa, Flying Dog El Dorado, or possibly Mission brewery shipwrecked double ipa. All good solid ipas with high abv.

3861,"2013-02-27",4.8,"Bottle pour into a tulip. When I find a good highly rated IPA that I havent ever had I try to compare it to the best IPA I know I can find. Today its Sculpin vs. Bells Two Hearted poured into identical glasses. I am a huuugggeee fan of two hearted so this is going to be a tough one, but here goes. Aroma: I gotta say sculpin wins on this one, helluva good tropical fruit aroma. Two hearted has the classic hop aroma, but sculpin is more nuanced, fruity and more tropical than most. I also have to give the appearance category to sculpin. Pours a good 1 inch head that sticks around. Its a clearer golden than two hearted with nice lacing that sticks to the side of the glass. Taste: Two hearted is so balanced piney and citrus, thats what I love about it, but the sculpin is so tropical. Ton of pineapple and mango, damn good too. These are so different in taste. Sculpin reminds me quite a bit of Shlafly Tasmanian almost in that pineapple mango. Each has its merits, and because they are so different the taste between these two is a toss up. I sat them both to warm up a bit, they were a touch too cold, but after waiting 20 minutes the tastes are better on both- but still a tie. I call tie on taste category. Overall: geez, two hearted has met its match. Even though sculpin won in aroma and appearance I think I have to call tie, but that is saying something huge(I have done the compare ratings with two hearted coming out on top over Racer 5, GD Titan, Stone IPA, Loose Cannon Hop3, Rogue Yellow Snow, Founders Centennial, 60 minute, etc.) They are very different. albeit American IPAs. If you like pine and citrus two hearted is a god that will never disappoint. Sculpin is more interesting and may be the best IPA I have ever had that is heavy handed on the tropical flavors (other than Bells hopslam). You cant go wrong with either of these. Unbelievable ale, I just wish it wasnt quite so expensive. Two hearted is a bit cheaper around me (DC area) so Ill stick with that, but Sculpin will be a nice treat from now on. Well done Ballast Point.","","neontb"

Appearance: Pay attention other breweries, this is exactly how an IPA should look.

The retention is average, but it settles into a creamy thick coating.
Aroma: Hops, hops, hops. The aroma is dominated by the hops, but hints only slightly at bitterness. The aroma is strong of oranges and grapefruit in good balance.
Taste: This is balanced beautifully, the malts are mild on the intro and provide a pleasant backing for the flavorful orange hops with mild grapefruit bitterness. The flavor lingers for a bit of oranges then grapefruit.

3861,"2013-01-09",4.2,"Now THIS is an IPA.  Ive had this both bottled and on tap, and I think I prefer it on tap.  It pours a clear, golden orange color with a light, dense, white head that leaves some pretty sticky lacing.  The nose is fantastic.  Barley, caramel malts, and robust, sweet, piney hops all surface in the aroma, making for one of the best-balanced noses of any IPA I can think of.  As crisp as the hops are in this, it as an incredibly smooth moth feel - so smooth that its hard to sufficiently describe.  The potency of the hops really control the palate of the beer, but are extremely well-balanced with the caramel malts.  Sweet and slightly fruity, dried apricots are the fist thing that come to mind, yet the fruitiness of the beer is only obvious if you search it out.  This is an extremely fine-tuned beer.  It has a grainy sweet finish with a hop presence that echoes the delightful experience you taste as it enters the mouth.  Its like the flavor persists into the finish as-is.  This is surely one of the best IPAs ever.  Smooth, supple, sweet (but not too sweet), hoppy (but not bitter), and with absolutely no jagged edges.

Faint tropcial fruit in the flavor balanced with pine and earthy hops. Caramel is quite prominent with lots of wood.

Clear brilliant oranges under a slightly off-white head which fades slowly and purposefully into a thin collar bordering a soft blanket. Lovely layers of lace linger and remain mostly undisturbed with a few teasatory swirls.

Nose:
Massive grapefruit, key lime, and lemon esters abound  take whole fruits, cut, peel, squeeze, enjoy. Grapefruit is the dominant citrus which directs and carries the key lime and lemon. Pine needles and fir trees underneath. Whisper of mint leaf in the back. Crunchy white table crackers. Dew-dropped freshly mown grass as far as the nose can smell in-between row after row of citrus trees equally dew-dropped with fruit hanging low.

Palate:
Grapefruit abounds  pink, white, and yellow  fresh, tart, sweet, and bright. Mint, fir trees, and pine needles in the finish. Bracing parching cleansing finish. Cut dew-dropped green grass. Closing the eyes I envision myself amidst rows of citrus trees hanging heavy and damp forests of vivid green fir and pine trees. Crisp, clean, and brilliant. Rind lingers atop my tongue after each swallow.

Id drunk many a glass of Sculpin from Ballast Point before I realized I had yet to take tasting notes. Oops. Guess Ill just have to suffer through another glass, and so I did and here we are now.

Update 5/6/13: I found a bottle marked ""Enjoy By 4/20/13"", indicating that as of today, it was bottled about 135 days ago. Figured it would be a good experiment. At this age, the citrus has dropped off considerably. The hop flavors are very hollow and papery with only some minor resinous pine and some dry bitterness left.

Taste is fabulous mix of bright crisp hops, citrus and apricots. Neither sweet or dry, and one of the easiest to drink IPAs I have tried. Good thing it is light on alcohol (for an IPA that is). Perfect amount of fizz to go with the fresh flavors and aroma. Overall a delicious beer perfect for late afternoon relaxin'!

Drunk on 10-12-12, reviewed from notes

A: Golden-copper yellow. Great white head lasts for the duration of the beer.

N: Oh Lord in Heaven. Pineapple, mango, citrus, mandarin orange. This is like walking around a fruit stand.  Some pine. This nose goes on forever.

T: As fruity as the nose is, the body is equally piney and earthy. Very, very bitter and dry. A little pineapple, but this is an overwhelming spruce bomb. Some bready/biscuity notes and malt. Quite the dichotomy.

M: Palate is dry to the point where its like a hop covered with spikes and razors. Fair amount of alcohol.  

O: The epitome of the West Coast IPA. Dry, scraping, and lacking in most of the malt needed to balance out the hops. If only the dry hopping lasted throughout the body, this might be my first perfect 5.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

Poured from bomber into snifter

A: Pours a nice clear golden apple color with a light peach 1.5 finger head. Great retention on this brew. An incredible net-like lace follows me down the glass. 

S: Nice light citrus hops, sweet honey, floral hops as well. 

T: Very sweet flowers with a light citrus hoppy note. Just a tad bitter on the backend but mellows back to a nice sweet oak. 

M: Light bodied, incredibly smooth and a nice light carbonation as well. Leaves a nice sweet and bitter taste.

3861,"2012-08-25",3.5,"22 oz bottle poured into a tumbler pint glass. Best by date is 09/07/12, so this should be nice and (relatively) fresh...

A: Pours a lightly cloudy golden amber color with light carbonation. The head is a nicely frothy two finger offwhite head with excellent retention and texture. Leaves a nice ring of lacing, and is a generally beautiful beer.

S: Nicely tropical, with notes of mango, apricot, and passion fruit. A little bit of the malt backbone pops up here, too. Nice smelling, but not quite as boldly aromatic as I was expecting.

T: Much like the nose, strong tropical fruits (mango, grapefruit rind, and apricot) open things up, and stay there throughout the flavor progression. Aside from the citric notes, this is also very piny (and almost peppery) in its hop composition, especially on the finish. The malt backbone is just there - all it does is provide a neutral canvas while giving a nice balance. I like the complexity of the hop character, but this isnt the end all be all I was expecting it to be. Its still a good IPA, though.

M: Very dry and very oily. Its a rather coarse and prickly beer in general; a little more smoothness would be incredibly welcome. While the coarse, well carbonated character gives it nice drinkability, it means its a little harsh going down.

O: Its a good IPA. Its a very good IPA. But its NOT the masterpiece I hoped it would be. I feel like its too resinous and dry to truly belong in the elite tier.

3861,"2012-07-31",3.4,"Interesting beer. Thought I should try this as I like more balanced IPAs that have the malt backbone to support the hops.

The pour looked great, clear amber/copper color with white head and smelt strongly of malts, maybe a hint of piney hops in the nose, but mostly the caramel & breadiness of the malts broke through. Slight hint of grapefruit in the nose, but not as much as I would have liked.

Taste wise it wasnt at all what I was expecting, strong malt-forward beer here that had a strong caramel and breadiness/yeast like flavor with the grapefruit noticeable, but not dominate. For an IPA I was baffled as to how the hops had fallen to the back in this beer.

Mouthfeel is great, its a very drinkable beer thats very smooth, almost no bitterness to this beer, probably due to the lack of dominant hops. Light carbonation.

All-in-all a good solid beer, but not at all what I expected in a balanced IPA. Most of the time I think IPAs as overly hopped up and never would have figured thered be an IPA that was overly malted up.","Denver, Colorado, USA","prosper0"

Appearance: Pours orange in color with pretty good clarity.  Theres a touch of haze, but this ones fairly clear.  Off-white head stood about a finger tall initially, but has settled to a thin and spotty layer after only a few minutes.  Theres some lacing being left behind with each sip.

Aroma: A good mix of citrus and pine in the aroma.  Im definitely getting orange and grapefruit, but Im also detecting a touch of blue spruce if you will.  Very appealing to say the least.

Taste: The bitterness jumps in the drivers seat right from the get-go.  After that, the citrus and pine carry over from the aroma and take hold of your palate.  Theres a touch of sweetness towards the middle, and its needed!  Bitter hops linger on through the finish and LONG after the swallow.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with an aggressive bitterness and moderate carbonation.

Overall: A  top 10 IPA .....hands down.

Moreys Bottom Line:  As I mentioned, this beer is one of the few IPAs that Ive had that combines both citrus and pine, which makes it somewhat unique in my opinion.

Pineapples, big tropical fruits, mango, apricot, florals, resiny pines, and a light caramel malt sweetness to balance, but allows the hops to shine. Flavor isnt as complex, but really solid. Tropical fruits, peach, grapefruit, and a light melon with some florals and moderately resiny pines. The hops are balanced nicely with a slightly grainy, lightly sweetened pale malt as well as a light caramel that stays in the background for the most part. Finishes dry with a nice, fruity, slightly sweet hopping that leaves a medium, resiny and piney, floral bitterness as well as a light malt backing to balance. Lengthy aftertaste following a light-medium body and a moderate carbonation. Overall, a really nice IPA that Ive been waiting to try for quite some time. The aroma is great and the flavor is solid as well. Tons of hops with a malt backing that allows the hop complexity to dominate, but provides just enough balance and keeps this very easy drinking. Love the tropical fruits in this one. Excellent IPA.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Beer smell like funky pine hops and not much else. Smells fine for an IPA.

Spicy, citrus and pine hops. Beer is not dry but rather wet. Almost no aftertaste. The hops cover you mouth. Second taste oranges, pine, lemon, some sweetness, a very good tasting beer.

Sculpin pours a slightly hazy golden color, with a huge foamy white head. Nice retention, stays with the beer the whole way, along with some sticky lace.

Great floral hoppy smell, some cooling pine, and a splash of juicy citurs as well. 

The taste starts with a candy sweet bready malt, quickly taken over by the robust hop bill. Floral, pine, and apricot and mango citrus. The pine almost turns into a cool mint flavor. Finishes slightly bitter.

The simcoe hops help to provide a cooling sensation on the tongue, with the dry hopping providing a tingling sensation on the tongue. Good, crisp, slightly creamy carbonation with a slightly above medium body. Finishes pretty clean.

Nose is tropical fruits (apricot, mango), citrus and grapefruit with a very strong hop presence. Hard to tell, but maybe cascade, amarillo, some nelson sauvin? I dont know, but its definitely rich, fruity hops. Flavour is immediately bitter with a nice pungent quality. The bitterness increases through the sip until gently settling into a long and very enjoyable finish that mellows out but stays with you for a long time.

3861,"2012-02-14",3.2,"This was my first time ordering online and none of the hop forward beers I purchased came with any dates that I could tell, disappointing. This one is over the hill.

Nice golden pear tone, thinner head that recedes to a minimal cap but then retains throughout

Nose is a bit subdued, mostly citrus but truly difficult to discern, I have an easier time smelling the glass that I poured it into.

The character isnt nearly as muted as I wouldve guessed by the smell - all that citrus - tangerine, grapefruit, abstract bitter... clearly outdated though.

Mouthfeel is thinner than I wouldve expected but seems appropriate for this particular brew, carbonation is still spot on.

3861,"2011-10-04",3.1,"Ported from BA.

Appearance:
Lots of foamy white head, almost 3 fingers of it. The beer itself is more of a golden yellow honey color. It has some slight haze to it, but that might be from the low temperature.

Smell:
Piney and lemony. What we have here is a bottle of Pinesol, no doubt. Some apricot also comes in, which is a pretty nice little change from the usual grapefruit flavors weve been seeing lately.

Taste:
Wow, WAY drier than what I was expecting from the smell. On top of that, its extremely piney. The bottle mentions several fruits, but if theyre in there, they cant stand up to the crazy amount of pine in this thing. Theres a good amount of bitterness sticking around too.

Mouthfeel:
A light body that really sticks to you. Theres something kind of syrupy about it actually.

Overall:
Solid, but not as well balanced as Id like. Definitely has a high drinkability, and it might be a good introductory IPA due to its light body and non-overwhelming bitterness. Would I have another? Maybe. Would I buy another bomber? Probably not.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

3861,"2011-08-22",3.9,"This is a tremendous little IPA from BP. One I didnt know much about prior to the GBBF 11. Pours very pale golden, looks like a blond beer. Nice one finger bright whit head with average retention and decent lacing. Aroma is pretty knock out stuff, big tropical aromas of passion fruit and mango with a heavy resinous and slightly spicy character, real earthy in the background, but very fruity at the same time. Nice touch of a honeyed note to keep a balance to the earthy hop/tropical hops. Flavour is so incredibly crisp for the style, I was expecting mouth coating San Diego style IPA, but no, its almost Pilsner in feel but with massive flavour, Incredibly crisp and refreshing, it opens with citrus and peach, moves to a slightly honeyed cereal note in the mids and out of nowhere comes some note worthy bitterness which takes you in to a great highly aromatic finish with grapefruit bitterness, orange, perfume and highly floral notes. Oddly enough the characteristic I love most about this is also the only gripe Id have: I want more body, but yet at the same time Im blown away by the crisp drinkablity of the beer, so do I need more body? It just drinks like it were 4.5-5% rather than 7% Its a real master class in how to make a light crisp and ultimately highly refreshing IPA but pack in as much flavour without it becoming cloying or oily.

3861,"2011-08-17",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 22, 2013 Served on cask at Als of Hampden into a nonic pint. This was the fuggle dry hopped version.


A - Pours a deep, hazy, copper orange with a small one finger white head that leaves light, sticky, lacing down the glass.


S - HUGE hope aroma. Hints of grapefruit, tangerine, and other pungent tropical fruits. A slightly sweet aroma from the malt is a welcome addition to all those hops. One of the best smelling IPAs I have ever had.


T - Starts out sticky sweet thanks to the roasted malt but that gives way quickly to the HUGE amounts of hops. Hops are similar to the nose with grapefruit coming thru more than the others. The grassy hops are not as pungent as in the nose but are still plenty strong. An absolutely amazing cask offering from Ballast Point. How can I drink normal sculpin after having all of these cask versions?


M - Fairly smooth feel with medium-light body and flavor with moderate carbonation. It hides the 7% very well but the big bitterness takes its tole.


O - Really incredible version of Sculpin. I could drink this every day for the rest of my life and be very happy. I have now had four different versions of cask Sculpin and this was my favorite, narrowly beating out the simcoe version.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

It pours a lightish gold with a frothy white head. There is some decent lacing as it recedes. 

The smell is nicely hopped. It is mostly pineapple and generic like smarties or something.

The flavor is really nice. It tastes like it gets way too much hype though. It has a clear cut bitterness which is great but it is the support act that isnt as great as I was hoping. There is some tropical fruit backing, but I want more.

Overall though it is a solid IPA.

New bottle best by 9/13, Crustal clear appearance. Aroma is citrus, pineapple, caramel, bready malt, some spice. Flavor is round, fruity, citrus, nice pine, very good bready malt base.

Pours lightly hazy golden amber with a three finger fluffy white head that holds a great cap and leaves nice spotty lacing.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a bit oily, medium carbonation.

An excellent IPA for sure although the hype train leaves a tad bit to be desired, particularly in the aroma department.  Im stoked to finally get a chance to try Sculpin and while it may not be quite everything I had hoped it is still a fantastic IPA and one I would seek out again.","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"
3861,"2011-08-04",4.1,"I split a 22oz bomber with a friend and poured it into an English nonic pint glass.Appearance: Bright, slightly hazy apricot or banana skin hue. Some carbonation visible. Forms an average size, eggshell colored frothy head. Excellent retention and lacing. Smell: A clean, bright, strong aroma of citrus fruits, tropical juice and flowers. Taste: If I was a little less ethical Id copy and paste my description of Stones Ruination IPA because that beer and the Sculpin IPA are extremely similar in their taste. It begins with a sharp, dry bitterness quickly followed by a sweet, rich and refreshing juice-like taste. Just like the nose, tropical fruits and citrus create for a mélange of acidic tartness and juicy sweetness. Orange and an orange sherbet-like flavor are very prominent throughout the palate. The beer finishes with an even strong burst of dry bitterness than it begins with. This is easily tolerable, but the intensity does wear down the palate a bit.Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with plenty of hop energy. More tepid than carbonated. Drinkability: What prevents Sculpin IPA from being a perfect beer, in my mind, is the fact its a challenge to drink. The massive hops create for plenty of flavor, but they also account for a sharp bitterness and an aftertaste that grows a little more dry and cloying with each sip. Theres a lot of energy and weight to this beer considering its only 7% ABV. Ideally, a great beer to have with food, although one serving in and of itself is more than satisfying.Overall, Ballast Point Sculpin IPA is a embodies the West Coast double IPA style and reminds me why I dig beers like this so much.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

3861,"2011-04-03",4.6,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2011 Bomber my bro brought back from his 24 hour FLA trip - thanks for sharing, ck1!  Pours a pale orange/brown with some foaminess.  Very nice lacing.  Aroma is massive fruity hops -- melon, grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple -- with some pine.  Taste actually matches the aroma well; sweet fresh fruit, pine, and some bitterness.  Somewhat sticky.  For as hoppy as it presents, and as understated as the malt presence is, it does not come across as one-dimensional.  Finishes long and leaves the great sweetness/bitterness mix.  This is one terrific brew!  Re-Rate 6/4/2011.  10.4.10.4.18.  Bomber was the last of my ""smuggled from FLA"" brews.  Pretty much same notes as before - perhaps the best combination citrus fruity/piney aroma I have ever had.  Terrific flavor combination with good blend of citrus fruit, pine and stickiness.  Finishes solidly with a sweet/bitter blend.  And very drinkable!  Are you kidding me??

3861,"2011-04-01",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 18, 2014 A: Bright orange/amber body... has a radioactive glow to it, which might scare some people but ill take it as the mark of greatness... the head is a flawless 3/4 inch fluffy white cap... good retention while leaving moderate lacing on the glass (perhaps the only ""flaw"" in this beer)

S: Heaping citric hops bombard the nose, if i didnt know any better id think i was drinking an immaculate mixed drink on the shores of tahiti on a cloudless day... that being said it was dark, gloomy, rainy Philadelphia... ah, spring in Philly... back to the beer... The hops take on a dynamic character, layering bright blast of grapefuit, mango, peach, apricot, orange, passion fruit ... its like drinking a Jackson Pollock painting

T: If there was an ideal citrus IPA flavor profile, this is it. Like the nose, the fruit flavored bitterness is relentless. There is enough here to explore for days. Almost no alcohol presence, and a nice, subtle sweet malt backbone keeps this beer from becoming juice.

M: Smooth, crisp finish. Refreshing. Nice bitter bite. Ideal carbonation.

O: Im mesmerized by this beer. While its not Pliny the Younger.... this beer is right there and NEEDS to be respected as such. If it wasnt for a law school final that I need to prepare for, I would have stayed all night. Im serious... I would have been at the bar from 5pm til they carted me out drinking this gem.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

4.5 A: Hazy yellow orange color. Two fingers of thick creamy off-white head. Average retention for most of the head, but the last 1/8 inch or so sticks around for a long time. Tons of uniform lacing down the whole glass.

5.0 S: Wow! This isnt the strongest smelling DIPA Ive had (its up there), but it is the most harmonious mixture of citrus Ive ever experienced. Pineapple and mango are the most intense, followed by orange, tangerine, and grapefruit. Touch of pine underneath with some floral hops in there as well.

3.5 T: The taste is a bit disappointing after the nose. Bitterness is there, but there isnt nearly as much fruitiness to balance it out. Still, there is some pineapple and some lemon. Theres more pine and grapefruit than in the nose.

3.0 M: Lighter medium body, but it strangely lays heavy on the tongue. Could be a lot creamier. Id also like a heavier body. Good moderate carbonation.

3.5 D: Pretty good, but one of the reason I really like DIPAs are for the awesome creamy mouthfeels. Still, Im glad this comes to Pittsburgh from time to time.

The Sturdy hop character is sublimely countered by a slightly burned and sugared backbone and fruited green apple slightly sparklingly sour echo, which gradually yeilds a lingering and lasting bittering dusty twinge tract down the center of the mouth.  An outstanding brew, with an incredible aroma and impressive depth and character.","Miami, Florida, USA","cbeers21"

Aroma of light but grassy hops, malt, a ton of citrus and a touch of white pepper. Medium-bodied; Strong hops at first that fade from grassy, herbal notes to a slightly piney and a touch resiny at the finish. Aftertaste is a bit bitter from the hops, but relatively mild compared to the style. Overall, a solid IPA, but nothing amazing, but thats perhaps because I kept this one for a few months after purchasing it - letting the hops lose their edge.

My last great bottle of beer from Ballast Point was Dorado, which to this day is one of my all-time favorite IIPAs.  Thi is an equally amazing, incredibly tasty beer that deserves to be considered, in my mind, one of the great IPAs Ive ever had.  Like Dorado, this tropical fruit in the aroma and flavor is simply amazing.  Its aromatherapy for beer lovers.  The mangos and pineapple juice go so well with he rose petals, and lemony zing.  The flavor is simply  homerun.  Multiple waves of juicy hop goodness...apricot, peaches, citrus, candy-like malts...some crazy pepper-like notes get picked up and grass clippings but wow.

A: Pours a copper orange with white head. Decent amount of lacing as it goes down.

S: Plenty of tropical fruits and citrus; there is a lot going on in the hop bill here.

T: Much along the same lines as the smell, although the hops arent quite as strong as I was hoping, and I know that this was the freshest batch, so I feel like I was missing something, but it was the first beer of the night for me, so I dont think there was anything interfering.

M: Right in the range for the style, helping it to drink quite well.

D: Very drinkable. This is where it might have helped that the hop bill wasnt too strong in the taste. Good brew all around, and Im looking forward to trying it again.

Not bad, but this is so oriented on citric hop notes that the flavors probably are harmed a bit by bottling and travel across the US.  Still nice.

12 oz draft at City Beer in San Francisco. Pour is a hazed orange golden with a well formed one inch off white head. The head is lasting, and leaves behind great lacing.  Pretty beer.  Aroma is all hops, dank pine citrus and full of resin. Fresh, also some balance provided by biscuit malt. The taste is initially the big, fresh hops, lingering with a pleasant dry bitterness. The biscuit malt of the nose gives it a nice body and balances. Palate is medium to full bodied, with lowish carbonation and the clean dry finish. A really nice IPA, happy to have it tried it on draft. (8,5,9,5,17 - 4.4)","Kansas, USA","theisti"

Very consistent, right now Im drinking this on a nightly basis. This is pretty much IPA perfection, and is pretty much everything I want in an IPA. Decidedly better in bottle than on tap. Unfortunately I cant find it in bottle anywhere other than Julios Liquors. Will stock up soon for the summer before going back home, thinking ~20 bottles, ~$200, hope that will be enough.

Clear amber; medium frothy white head; appetizing appearance. Incredible aroma, lots of grapefruit, passionfruit. Easy to gulp down; medium bitterness, white grapefruit, slightly powdery texture. On the dry side but carrying a lot of flavor. This hits you in the same way that peeling a grapefruit releases its aromatics. Exceptional IPA.

3861,"2010-06-13",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2014 My Bottom Line:
This artful India Pale Ale organizes sandy, citrusy hops and polished honeyed malts into a colourful array of aromas and flavors until a wooden, resinous hop bitterness rises like the dawn upon the back of the palate.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A layer of foam decorates the nearly translucent blond. 
-The softly effervescent mouthfeel works wonderfully with the healthy body. 
-This is very drinkable for 7% abv. 
-The flavour profile is multifaceted and firm while never being boisterous. Just beautiful. 
-Those lemony tips help the impression of quaffability.

The two guys who came up with the recipe were actually there at the time.  Poured a golden / light orange color, thick head, with clean lacing.

3861,"2010-05-24",4.7,"Ive had this beer multiple times in bottle, on cask and draft and am finally getting around to reviewing it.

Pours a dark golden tangerine/orange color with bright golden yellowish orange hues when held to a light source and a large 2.5 finger frothy, soapy white head. Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a thick lasting cap that leaves chunks of soapy lacing in its wake.

Uber-fresh luscious hop aroma that is bursting with sweet tropical and citrus fruit notes. There is also a slight dry earthy pine/spruce character in the nose along with subtle alcohol sweetness and perfect malt balance. The maltiness is there with some slightly toasty biscuit and graham cracker but the nose on this beer is all about the hops.

Medium bodied but on the lighter end with a slightly chewy hop forward presence that lingers over the subtle malt backbone into a sweet yet dry finish. Again, the flavor of this beer is dominated by insanely fresh delicious hops that give off a slight dry bitterness and a huge tropical/citrus fruit notes. Lots of mango, pineapple, orange and lemon peel and grapefruit. Theres also a slightly lactic creaminess that adds to the beers complexity and makes it incredibly smooth and quaffable. The malt backbone is subtle and slightly toasty with hints of caramel, biscuit and graham cracker. Perfectly balanced with sweet fruit, dry bitter hop and subtle malt flavors bouncing off of each other. I cant say enough about this beer. One of my favorites of all time and highly recommended!","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
3861,"2010-05-23",4.1,"I drank Alpha King for the first time earlier today, and this beer is eerily similar, but to me it is a decent bit inferior in quality.  It starts with a rather boring appearance, a golden color verging slightly into orange territory but with a head that fades quickly and leaves little or no lacing.  The nose is of similar quality to AK, with mango absolutely jumping out and a slight note of pineapple juice acidity.  The taste is good, but not as pleasant as that of Alpha King, being less varied in its fruity flavors and also shockingly bitter.  I appreciate some bitterness in my beers; Pliny the Elder is probably my favorite beer for drinking in a session, but Sculpin is a bit less graceful than that beer and takes a hit because of it.  The palate is nice, with a medium body and decent malt smoothness mostly on the front end.  Overall, Sculpin is a really, really good beer.  A 4.1 makes this very clear.  But I do wonder if I would have like this beer a lot more with just a slightly lower IBU level.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"
3861,"2010-05-23",4.1,"Appearance: Slightly cloudy, more towards golden than orange, with a 1 finger white crown that shows some retention and lacing. This looks like my kind of IPA!

Smell: Not the most pungent IPA, but still a fairly impressive array of grapefruit citrus notes and floral hop notes over a pale malt.

Taste: Grapefruit and a slight pine note coupled with grass. Nice amount of hop bitterness without much astringency!

Mouthfeel: Im not sure on this one. Its a touch chewy, seems a touch undercarbonated, but is fairly spot on.

Drinkability: Fantastic for a brew with so much hop goodness.

T- Pink grapefruit, orange and citrus upfront with a substantial caramel malt backbone. The finish is all spicy hops as a big spicy hop bitterness blends with spicy hop flavors. At first the bitterness seems almost overbearing and prickly but after a few sips the spiciness really comes through more than the bitterness.

P- Medium to high tingly carbonation and a medium-to light weight, full quite oily, smooth body.

Ive heard people talking this one up for years, and Ive always written it of as some combination of hyperbole and homerism --- man was I wrong! This is the first IPA Ive ever encountered that can stand up shoulder to shoulder with Pliny the Elder and not have a thing to apologize for. Indeed, this one is very much in the PtE vein (or vice versa; I dont know which came first). The nose is outrageous, absolutely enormous floral, fruity, mango dry hopped delight. The flavor is tons of pineapple, ample citrus, never too much resin, just splendid. The malts stay in the background but thats entirely appropriate for the light-toned IPA styling; its all about the spendid fruity hop aromas and flavors. What a brilliant beer!

Huge fruit aroma, citrusy hops, melon, lychee, and other tropical fruits, though mostly grapefruit, or, to be more precise, Buntan, which is a Japanese grapefruit-like citrus. Aroma is close to that of the inner peels. Sweet, fruity flavora bit candyish, actually, with buntan, zest, melon and pineapple. Very much like a sorbet or a fruit salad that has had grapefruit juice poured all over it. A slightly comical beerin a good way. One of the most fun beers I have had in a long while.

I got huge aromas of citrus fruits and flowery grasses coming off the nose of this one. It was really a pleasant aroma not harsh like some IPAs it did add a lot to the experience. The flavor defiantly was a west coast take on a IPA very hop forward. There is also enough sweetness form the malts to keep this brew from being one of those one dimensional brews. It had a light to medium feel to it with good carbonation.

3861,"2010-02-05",3.7,"Enjoyed via draft in a whiskey snifter.  The beer pours a slightly-darker-than-medium amber color with a moderate white head.  The nose brings the expected strong character of west coast hops, with what seems to be an especially enthusiastic nod to Cascade, Amarillo, and perhaps just a bit of Simcoe.  Hops overwhelm malt in the nose, and no discernable sweetness is noticeable in the nose.  The palate is full without being cloying and bitter without being puckering.  The aforementioned hops make their presence known in the apparoach, followed by a very nice note of hop resin on the tongue.  Malt character is perceptable, but is pretty thoroughly muddled by lingering hop flavor.  Sweetness is mild but pleasant.  The finish is clean and semi-sweet.  Overall, this is a tremendous beer; one that belies a relatively light abv with heavy flavor and enough finesse to keep from being a cloying bully on the palate.  Quite good.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

So much pineapple and mango notes, tangerines, and then some nicely bitter grapefruit and pine needles in the background with some cotton candy and caramel. The flavor has a bit of an added grassy hoppiness, and the tropical flavors dont quite jump out at me as much as they had in the aroma. The cotton candy and caramel malts meld with the hops very well in that I get ""sweet hops""--I dont get this very often in beers and I think its great.

3861,"2010-01-10",4.0,"Yellow, almost straw-colored (great to see an IPA of this magnitude thats actually a pale ale). A rather thin white head settles in a moderate pace.

Massive hop aromas in the nose. Plenty of exotic fruits, but not so dominated by grapefruits as many other hop forward beers are. Instead here are generous amounts of mango and passion fruits (along with the grapefruit of course). Here is also a very pleasant smell of elder flowers. Some pine needles and hop resins. Biscuity malts are present as well.

The taste replicates the smell with very fresh hop flavors all around. Exotic fruits (grapefruit, mango, passion fruit) mix with elder flowers and hop resins. A semi-sweet crisp and biscuity malty backbone. The finish is really bitter with notes of pine-needles and, citric notes and grassy hop notes.

Medium to semi-full body, nice sticky mouthfeel. Crisp carbonation.

This is a great IPA with a massive and very tasty hop profile. Still, it manages to stay very balanced. The malts are almost perfectly suited for the hop centered flavors.

3861,"2009-10-20",4.6,"Here is yet another big IPA that Ive been waiting (semi-patientingly) to sample.  I finally got my chance at the Craft Ale House, and it did not disappoint.  The unique trait I found with this beer was the oddly light body.  I was not expecting this beer to go down so similarly like iced tea or Kool-Aid.  The body was amazingly light, and was completely unexpected.  That characteristic makes this IPA a little more dangerous than others.  I think I could sit at the bar or at home and drink one of these right after another.  And that could lead to some qusi-undesired results.  The beer pours a light golden color.  It sports a white head that laces around the glass the entire way down to the bottom.  The nose has that West Coast IPA feeling, with lots of hops, grapefruit, pine and hop resin.  The flavors are well-balanced and extremely delicious, with a ton of crisp and floral hops and notes of grass, grapefruit, lemon zest, earth, light bread and a good balance of light malt.  The finish really stings the palate, with crisp hop character.  This is one outstanding IPA.  I wish this was more widely available here in southeastern PA.

The hops are different, but it reminds me of Pliny the Elder in that respect.  I was inspired to try them side by side and theyre quite similar beers, both magnificent.  Sculpin is clean and strong.  The mouthfeel is quite dry with lots of pleasant bitterness and no alcohol.

Initial is medium bodied, even keeled wih a good hopping of citrus, florals, and tropical fruits, the malt body isnt overbearing and a carmel bomb, but still packs a good balanced bitterness. Tropical mango always wins points with me in an IPA, with a touch of soapiness, good citrus to boot.

I think mango is the strongest scent followed by passion fruit, peaches, lemon and orange zest, floral hops, and a slight pine bitterness as well.

The flavor profile is loaded with citrus fruits with grapefruit and tangerines being very dominant followed up with only a slight touch of caramel malt. The hops are extremely fresh and vibrant on this offering. The malt is only barely noticeable, but somehow supports the hops beautifully.

Aroma is stellar, which is floral hops and exotic fruits (tangerine, mango, apricot). Lighter side of medium bodied with carbonation somewhere between medium and soft. The malt profile is very pale, pretty much to the point where the hops dominate the flavor. The hop profile more fruity than bitter, with pleasant notes of peach, orange, and pineapple. Good attenuation to compliment the fruit notes. Finish has moderate herbal spicy bitterness with toffee, but you can tell this is starting to go downhill.

Pine, peach, apricot, and mango are just HUGE in the nose.   The flavor has the same gigantic juicey hops but a relatively low bitterness that perfectly balances the bone dry malt.   Speaking of malt flavor, youd struggle to pick out much if anything through the hop juice.   Medium, almost light bodied with medium carbonation.   This is really a hop paradise on tap.   I had a bottle a couple days after sampling it on tap, and while excellent (maybe a 4.2) it didnt quite live up to sucking this nectar right out of the brewerys tap.

Aromas are simply lovely... a nice mix of citrus and tropical fruit:  lemon and mango come to mind, but it seems a little like cheating using descriptors from the description.  I can also pick up a little grapefruit and just a hint of pine in there.  Flavor is simply fantastic!  A lovely mix of the elements from the nose, but even more full than I would have guessed.  This is a fairly interesting IPA in that the fruit flavors seem to be much more tropical and sweet than citrus.  Still, they are well balanced and the malt stays away from the cloying sweetness.

I only let this sit for a week before I could resist the urge to open it.  West Coast IPAs seem to lose something even when chilled and I wanted the best experience possible.  I dont know how much this costs in California but if it were regularly accessible I may just buy it on a semi-regular basis.

Aroma / Appearance - The transparent golden body and stark white head formed a picturesque decoration on the coffee table.  Bright and grassy, the nose was fruity with the main aspect being canned mandarin oranges.

Flavor / Palate - The hoppy bite grabs you from the first sip and is consistent throughout.  A mixture of grass, pine needles, flower petals, and citrus it sits nicely on the tongue.  Despite being 7% ABV this was not tough to polish off as spring transitioned to summer.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3861,"2009-05-08",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 10, 2009 Bomber poured into a very clean snifter, slightly chilled.  Slightly tarnished brass color with streams of healthy bubbles and a casual white cap.  Very tropical nose, maybe I hould have an umbrella?  Mango, passion fruit, and tangello juice dominate the stage as a sweet grain peeks out from behind the curtain. Palate actually begins dry and bitter, like the skin of stone fruit.  The teeth continue to drive into the meat  and hop flavor resonates. The grain seems to well up from a terra haut of lush malt and adds an incredible balance to what looks like a hop bomb.  This beer drips the sweet smells and warmth of a brewery with refreshments at the end of the tour.  A round hop lingers in room but doesnt f%&k with the thermostat.  As good as they come. 

Re-rate, 8-10.  The numbers stay the same.  I will say that the nose has turned the volume down with a few months in the bottle. No worries, this is still an intense experience.  Last time I was obviously overwhelmed by the nose and entry.  The palate is very interesting.  This IPA finishes with some subtlety.  Carbonation finishes smooth and the hops linger like a recessing tide.  Very clean, with just the spice elements of the hops lingering.  Interesting.  This must be a seriously dry hopped beer.","Charleston, USA","Bigsilky"

3861,"2009-05-05",4.6,"22oz bottle courtesy of a trade with KingG, thanks! I always take a sniff off the bottle before pouring and this smells great! The color is a dark, but transparent, yellow and the head is full, sticky and firm. The aroma is pure West Coast IPA, piney, fruity, citrus, very nice. The flavor is a very green, almost vegetal hop flavor. There are also melon-rind notes which remind me of the Dorado DIPA. It does not quite live up to the aroma but it is still tasty. The mouthfeel is decent and the drinkability is good. Overall, this is a good West Coast IPA but I prefer the Big Eye from Ballast Point.

update 12/30/08 most recent batch

This is a very good IPA. I dont really taste the vegetal I got last time, just fruity, dank IPA. This is much better than Dorado or Big Eye. Friends said it was like Green Flash westcoast meets odell IPA. Awesome.

Color is a bright golden hue, transparent, with a slight tinge of orange.  Head is white and frothy rich, thick, meringue-like and jiggles when nudged.  Head recedes to a thinner, but long lasting lace and Belgian lace surrounds the inside of my glass as this one goes down.

Nose is full of bright citrus and citrusy black tea aromas.  Im leaning towards tangerine and peaches with that black tea component, and a slight suggestion of biscuits.

Sharp on the palate right away, but not an overwhelming in your face hop presence.  Its big but not an assault like some APAs can offer.

3861,"2009-01-03",3.4,"Pours with a frothy, two finger thick, pale, tan tinged, off-white colored head.  The beer is a clear amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, bright copper hue when held up to the light.  The aroma certainly hits the spot for any hop lover with a melange of herbaceous, spicy, fruity, citrusy and yes even dank hop character.  Malt, I don’t know much about that, though I am sure there might be a hint in the aroma some where, right now I am focusing on the hop aromatics that the malt character is supporting.  Vibrant lychee, ripe tangelo peal and bitter grapefruit oil round out the fruity hop aromatics, but in the deep draughts of the aroma it is the herbal hop components that reign.  There are turpene rich hop notes, a slight grassy edge, perhaps a hint of chive, but what really jumps out is the essential ""hemp"" oil components; sticky, dank, resinous, slightly rosemary like, touches of pine tar and a spiciness that almost make my nose itch.  Definitely a hop heads beer by the nose.

Lightly sweet up front and then a bracing, richly herbal, bitterness grabs hold of the tongue; this never recedes either as the bitterness lingers on in the palate after the beer has left my mouth.  The hop flavors have a fruity, almost oily character that is sensed as a backdrop to the other flavors; tropical fruit, lychee and bitter orange peel.  The flavor profile is dominated though by the herbal hop components.  Pepper, amply spicy, a touch of sharp rosemary, green turpenes and of course it has a biting, dank, ""hemp"" oil green flavor to it that lingers on with the bitterness in the finish.  This is definitely an aggressively hoppy beer, this can be nice, but somehow this beer seems a bit too one-dimensional, even for a overly hoppy IPA.  There is a soft supporting malt character that brings a hint of sweetness as well as a touch of cracker light malt to the flavor, it also supplies a medium’ish body to this brew.

A bit too herbal focused to be great for me; I prefer a nice balance of tropical fruit notes as well as the sticky herbal hop character (the aroma is a bit more balanced than the flavor, though still not quite enough).  Still this certainly has appeased my hop fix for the evening.

From a firkin. Oh boy. This knocked me over at the Bella Vista Grand reopening in October in Philadelphia. Those 2 oz samples were like little tiny bricks sealing me in to a personal twiddly state.

How: Bottles, tap, many times, many places.
The look: Partly cloudy glowing orange topped by a small white head
In long: Ultra-hoppy orangy nose.  Pillowy well-malted body.  Malt sweetness has sponge cake flavour and mouthfeel.  Enormous amount of hops.  Next to the sponge-cake maltiness I had orange peels dipped in caramel, cedar, dried bananas, honey, some pineapples and some sponge cake.  Pillowy body with a soft-medium carbonation.  That dry cedar flavour fit so well in there.  This is not a simple hop-juice IPA, this is rich, complex yet highly refreshing.  Simply put this is one of the best small IPA Ive ever had.

This is probably my favorite IPA and I’ve only had it twice. It poured a nice thick off white head and it has a beautiful golden color. The smell is just exceptional, above and beyond any other IPA I have ever had. Smells floral, grassy, piney, grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. Just all sorts of things going on in the smell and this translates directly into the taste. It tastes nice and hoppy, similar to the smell, and it also has a nice malty sweetness then a lingering, pleasant bitterness at the end. The mouthfeel is pretty good and the drinkability is amazing.

3861,"2008-06-25",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2008 Overall an exceptional beer. Very unassuming given the competition out there in CA and this style. Really seaking out more and more of the Ballast Point seasonal / rare beers has become an addiction. This was widely available, but very very quickly dissapeared, though lost forever. Very lucky that a friend had some extra bottles that got ""lost"" for me to have the opportunity to purchase again. Will drink 1 more soon, and keep the other 2 for the next several years.

Has more oil and orange flavors than other IPAs. Complexity of hops thru the finish is what makes this stand out. I can now see why you would ever want to buy a case of a craft beer after this experience. Usually you want to move onto the next one, here you want to come back again and again.

Re-tasted again last night...
This beer continues to WOW me. The smell is mesmorizing. The hops perfume are very complex and creamy on the nose. Intense and balanced. Great mid and finish also but the star is the nose.

3861,"2008-06-17",3.9,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle; vibrant orange lightly hazed.  Furiously bright mandarin and sweet garlic clove nose; sunspots of brilliant tropical flourishes and a dank bed of florals, needles, and cannabis.  Sunny and smooth, with balanced bittersweetness; a really ebullient and unrestrained hop presentation.  Flavor is big and citrusy, almost so bright and tangy as to be sweet with orange and pineapple sugary acidity.  Lemongrass and caramelly dough bring it back.  Pine-like and grassy aromatic bitterness coats the mouth slowly; commanding and firm, but never aggressive and always careful.  Honey sesame seeds, sweet pine wood, and pastry crusts lend dryness and chewiness; full, almost heavy palate is very resinous and rich, which is my only issue with the beer, really.  Id really love it to retain this punchy, perfectly balanced bittersweetness and dry texture while weighing a little less.  Finishes with caramel, tropical fruit, and floral sweetness, lightly dry.

Some sweetness emerged toward the end and balanced out the bitterness to some degree. Body was on the lighter end of the spectrum without being thin/watery. Hop flavors including the likes of citrus (grapefruit and orange rind) and pine were present throughout.

Initial blast of resiny hops with major citrus aromas of grapefruit and lemon. This is what an IPA should smell like.

Recieved this in a great box courtesy of errantnight, thanks again Derek! Oh, wow! As soon as I cracked this open I took whiff and I can tell Im going to be in for a treat but before I get to the nose let me explain the pour. Sculpin empties the bomber a moderately hazed golden with bursts of carbonation screaming to the surface. The clean white head grew to two + fingers on the pour and eventually fell to one fingers worth of dense creaminess. 

Now, What first caught my attention and has been on my mind ever since popping the top, the wonderful nose. Theres a small pale maltiness coming through way, way in back. The good stuff? Huge notes of apricot, tangerine, and a big freshly broken pine neddle hoppiness throughout. Ballast Point did an unbelievable job with the hop additions. Its reminiscent of the hopping I find in Dreadnaught and blows my mind that a brewer can get such vivid, delicious aromas from the little cones.

The flavor doesnt quite live up to the nose but that would be near impossible. The taste is softer than expected with a dominant apricot hoppiness upfront followed by the pinyness on the finish. A little sweet in the middle but damn, that apricot is vivid and delicious. This really is a great IPA. 

The mouthfeel is spot on. Solid carbonation awakens the tongue for the moderate bitterness present from mid-palate to the finish. The body is medium but the carbonation helps it glide through without a problem. 

I wouldnt have a problem drinking this beer all night. If Sculpin was available in my area it would be purchased by the forklift and drank just as quickly.

Ballast Point hit a homerun with Sculpin. A really great IPA with a hop profile that is very rarely found except in the most delicious of the style. Ballast Point makes some great beers and this may be the best Ive tried from them yet. A new favorite!

The aroma has a bountiful amount of tropical and piney hops along with some sweey bready malts and a hint of hop spice. The taste is nicely balanced between crisp citric hops and mild pale and caramel malting. The finish displays a light spicy note and some metallic tones. The mouth feel is sprite and crisp, very refreshing and drinkable. Yet another winning IPA from the SoCal area. Mikey Likey, get ya some before they are all gone.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
3861,"2008-04-18",4.3,"22. Thanks, Foolish_Mortal! BPs usual cool label happening, thats for sure. Pours a crystal clear, coppery medium amber with a towering, sudsy white head and plenty of lace down the side. Rich orange and mango nose...soooo citric and hop-oily. Creamy medium body with soft carb. Piney bitterness starts to emerge out of the mid-palate, under a lovely soft and sweet wash of peach, mango, apricot, and orange. Mild, crackery, piney finish. Delicious, sweet, and refreshing. Awesome IPA.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
3861,"2008-04-18",3.5,"Thanks to Crosling for sharing this beer.  Poured a clear golden color with a fluffy white head.  Aroma of sweet, piny hops with some tart citrus and leafiness.  Light malt upon entry leads directly into a piny, resiny hop hit with some nice citrus character and fresh, green hops on the finish.  Smooth on the palate, but a hint thin.  Overall, nice, basic IPA that has to be fresh to enjoy.","Aurora, Colorado, USA","BlackForestCO"
3861,"2008-04-17",4.2,"Bottle thanks to miketd - Nice looking golden color with a larger than average white head.  Aroma has an abundance of citrus and tropical fruits with some floral hoppiness in there too.  Flavor is a smooth and sweet mix of citra-floral-summer fruit flavored hops with some sugar and light malt.  Good mouthfeel with a light sting - really nice work from these guys.  This was really good - the best Ballast Point Ive had yet.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"
3861,"2008-04-17",3.3,"Pure west coast hops in the nose.  Authentic and just how an IPA should be.  Very vibrant.  Color is a very light gold, with ample foam.  Flavor, however, is a bit of a letdown.  Doesnt have a lot of malt depth.  The hops arnt as vibrant as Id like.  Needs more bitterness.  Still high quality, but just not as hoppy as Id like.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
3861,"2008-04-15",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2008 A hoppy light floral aroma thats not that strong. First sip - whew! Thats a double IPA! The meat of the beer isnt as agressive as the head or the first sip but it has a nice finish and when you want something with a kick this is it.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","dwyerpg"
3861,"2008-04-15",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 19, 2012 22oz from South Bay. Wow, this is yet another killer IPA from San Diego. Is there any doubt remaining that this area owns this style? I love the pale orange pour, slightly cloudy, with a big foamberg of a head. Big aroma of juicy hops, heavy on the tropical fruit for sure. I was skeptical reading about notes of mango, but nope, theyre in there. Not as sticky and resinous as the Dorado, but as rich and satisfying in its way - more quaffable, the fruit and hops practically sing. If theres a breakfast stout, can we call this a breakfast IPA?","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

3861,"2008-04-12",3.5,"Its upsetting they discontinued the Dorado.  This is essentially the single version of that...Damn hop shortage.  Id say pretty good nose of pineapple grapefruit, as usual.

3861,"2008-04-12",4.6,"Bottle from naven.  Oh no.  I knew I was in for it when I popped the top.  Pure, huge, fresh grapefruit and peach aroma.  Perfect aroma.  Beautiful pour with great lacing.  Add this to my list of beers Id have to have if deserted on an island.  This is perfection in a glass.  Flavor is pure hops without being overpowering.  Possibly the best iipa or IPA Ive tried.  The best use of hops for bittering and flavoring that Ive ever witnessed.  I think I might cry.","Freeport, Georgia, USA","jimbowood"
3861,"2008-04-09",4.2,"22oz bottle, no date from Holiday Wine Cellar.  Clear medium orange with a 1 1/2 finger slightly yellowish white head with good retention.  Wow, the tropical fruit aromas that I get from this beer are nothing short of awesome.  So much pineapple and mango notes, tangerines, and then some nicely bitter grapefruit and pine needles in the background with some cotton candy and caramel.  The flavor has a bit of an added grassy hoppiness, and the tropical flavors dont quite jump out at me as much as they had in the aroma.  The cotton candy and caramel malts meld with the hops very well in that I get ""sweet hops""--I dont get this very often in beers and I think its great.  Semi-dry finish with bitterness peaking around a 3.  Light to medium body with the same for carbonation.  An excellent IPA--hopefully they start bottling this year round--especially since they halted production on their Dorado.  Also, I may like this one more than Two Hearted, though my rating doesnt reflect it.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

The flavor is pretty big on the hops as expected, with a decent malt presence for some balance.  Definitely a little more piney than fruity, although there was some grapefruit in there as well.  Very good IPA, almost felt like a double to me.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"

The aroma is rich and pungent with big citrus notes, mandarin oranges in particular, this nose had a Pavlovian effect on me in which I broke out into a drool. A perfect ten in aroma! The taste is centered on the various fruits listed in the description with a big focus on sweetened pink grapefruit flavor and a bit of pine. The mouthfeel is silky smooth and the carbonation is light. The finish is long and lightly biter with lingering pineapple. Overall: this is a great IPA, one that elevates the art of brewing. Highly recommended.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"

Pours clear straw colored gold with a small white head and intricate lacing. Incredibe aroma, one of the best smelling beers Ive had the pleasure of drinking. This thing is packed with mango, pineapple and grapefruit smells with a piney note. The taste is strong on the citrus with grapefruit and pineapple coming through the strongest on the finish. Not overly bitter but its definitely an IPA. Again not my style but this is a very impressive IPA.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
3861,"2008-03-27",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2009 Very dank and aromatic IPA. First thing after popping the bottle is the aroma - it just comes at you. You could smell this beer across a room - and thats a good thing. Full of rich hop character, very piney and resinous as well as citrusey. Reminds me of Blind Pig. Flavor is sweetness that slowly recedes, with a bitter note that sticks around. Not much aftertaste, but thats OK. Once again, BP makes another great beer!

SECOND REFLECTION: This is one amazing beer. Right now, I will change it to be above Blind Pig.","San Ramon, California, USA","Taverner"
3861,"2008-03-26",4.2,"My 100th IPA rating!  WooHoo!  22 oz bottle, via trade.  Pours a clear dark straw gold body with a nice big foamy white head that left lots of intricate lacing.  Wow!  The nose on this is just killer.  So bright and fresh smelling, the hops are bursting with fruit aromas of tangerine, apricots, and peach.  Minimal malt in the nose, but thats just fine by me.  It just smells so simple and yet so complex at the same time.  The flavor is really interesting as well, theres so much hoppiness, but the bitterness is really minimal, making it incredibly easy to drink.  So much mango and dried apricot on the finish, yet the low bitterness makes it fade fairly quickly that you want another sip right away.  The malt is so subtle and secondary that it really showcases the hops well.   Mouthfeel is lighter bodied with a bit of doughy stickiness on the finish.  The carbonation really brings out the hops as well, firm and fizzy, but its really fine.  Overall, this was one of the best IPAs that Ive had in a long time!  Im glad that I tried this so fresh though, cause I think that this will lose alot of its beauty pretty quick.  Fantastic stuff!","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
3861,"2008-03-24",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2009 Bomber. This is a fantastic IPA. Pours very clear and has the citrus aroma in spades. White peach, grapefruit, lemon, honey.

3861,"2008-03-10",4.0,"Another San Diego IPA home run.  Poured from an ultra-fresh bomber. This one pours a clear orange-gold.  A small, foamy, off-white head leaves random spots and snakes of lacing on the glass.  Aromas are fresh and well balanced.  Big notes of freshly sliced oranges, tangerines, peaches, and apricots rendezvous with bitter pine resin and hints of green grass, all over lightly sweet toffee malts and dry grains.  The flavors just pop with bright citrus and stinging, bitter resin.  The grass component is very green, helping to wipe the palate clean of sharp hop residue.  Finishing bittersweet, with hints of butterscotch, this is a very satisfying brew.  Medium-full bodied, the palate gets just a bit sticky after a few glasses.  Awesome stuff from a great IPA master!","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

I love the way these flavors come together as noted in the first sip. The taste is crisp with semi bitter grapefruit hops and more like orange juice. The malts take a back seat to the hops but make a notable appearance bringing the bitter grapefruit citrus hoppiness closer to more like sweet orange juice.

I also got a little bit of graininess and some caramel malt. Pretty good. At this time during the night I was also pretty fucked up after many big beers.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"

3861,"2007-06-04",3.6,"Cask Pull at the PP Real Ale Fest.  Mostly transparent, gentle golden color with an even layer of white soapy head.  Lots of grapefruit and piney hop resins in the nose, creating the initial impression of a big hop monster.  Some light lemony and gentle bready malts back it up some, along with a touch of tropical pineapple spiciness.  Light bodied, mild carbonation.  A bit thinner and less bold than expected, especially considering the nose.  The malt character doesnt seem to stand up to the hop promise too well, leaving behind an herbal crispness in the wake of a bland, grainy cracker-ish malt base.  Perhaps the cask accentuates some of the malt weaknesses or fails to highlight some of the sharp hop characters without the prickling carbonation - these are the thoughts Im left pondering.  Not a bad beer by any means, but I just feel it would be a better cask beer with some more malt complexity.  Finish is dry, clean, and refreshing with a lingering herbal piney hop smack.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
3861,"2007-06-03",4.2,"Fresh from the brewery. Its a heavy looking brass color with a stiff layer of white head. The initial aroma is pure citrus and hop but a more detailed scent of grapefruit and fresh pine will shine through. The flavor is a strong delivery of citrus and piney hops with just the lightest dabble of grainy malt. This ipa sure does pack a punch which makes me wonder what the alcohol percent is. Also, I didnt think this Sculpin IPA was very far off from Ballast Points el Dorado double IPA. I think the logo of this sculpin ipa was real cool too.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

In the past year or two I feel I have been hit over the head w/ 100+ ibu beers.  OK, we get it.

3861,"2006-11-02",2.9,"UPDATED: NOV 3, 2006 Draft: Peach in color with a yellow cast. Stiff and fluffy white foam clings with each sip. Delicate aroma of grassy hops, honeysuckle, tangerine, and lime. Hint of doughy yeast. Carbonation is airy and slightly chalky. Dustily crackery malt dryness neutralizes the initial burst of juicy peach and orangey hops. Notes of popcorn exude as the huskiness/graininess and doughy yeast steadily grow and overshadow the vibrant hops. Flash of peachy acidity refreshes, though it hampers the body. Clean but understated grassy bitterness tickles the palate, but the crackery malt persists. Finishes dully bitter and dryly chalky, but persistently crunchy with malt, as the blandness continues with merely a hint of tangy tangerine. Has a decent aroma, but it could stand to be less doughy. As far as flavor and texture go, its far too grainy and theres nowhere near enough hop flavor or bitterness to combat it. Pretty simple and boring.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3861,"2005-09-03",3.8,"22-Aug-05 (Draft: Ballast Point Brewing Co. in San Diego, CA) Even with this tiny sample glass that Ballast Point uses, lots of grapefruit is blasting my nostrils, and the flavor is strong grapefruit too, but not overly bitter.  Nice pale malt body is somewhat sweet and provides a soft-spoken base for the hops to work off.  With the eight (or so) hops used in this IPA, it has a complex hoppiness, and that complexity is plainly illustrated when this beer is compared side-by-side with Big Eye IPA.  In addition to grapefruit, the bright hops flavors take on an herbal and tea aspects as well, something I dont get with the Big Eye.  And Big Eye is a much maltier and balanced IPA than North Star, which shows more fruitiness and orange citrus.  Yellow in color, fully clear, with an off-white head.  I definitely prefer this to Big Eye, but apparently North Star will be draft only, and will not be a regular offering.28-Aug-05 (Draft: Liars Club in San Diego, CA) Okay, I can actually sample this beer in a REAL glass.  And wow, this is one of the best smelling IPAs Ive ever experienced.  Orange citrus, pine and fresh passion fruit like you wouldnt believe, but youve had to have eaten fresh passion fruit out of the shell.  The flavor is similar, tons of passion fruit and pine and citrus.  Moderately bitter and hoppy, but the malt is light and barely perceptible.  Medium bodied, clean and crisp from start to finish.  Medium gold color.  The off-white head pours to half-an-inch in height, settles to a rim, and leaves minimal lacing.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
