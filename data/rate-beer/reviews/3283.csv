3283,"2015-06-28",4.3,"2013 bottle, served in tulip glass. Pours intense amber with medium white frothy head. Smells similar to those caramel-ish IPAs, which is interesting. The flavour is way more malty and fruity than the aroma, sweet but not cloying at all. After a few minutes, one starts to get a permanent bitter sensation on the palate, definitely very pleasant. Medium mouthfeel, perfect carbonation. Dont know if its because of the aging, but thats really great.","Barcelona, CATALONIA, ","Acid303"

3283,"2013-06-07",3.9,"Misty reddish brown body with beige creamy head. Big aroma, packing foresty hops together with a biscuit and bready maltyness. Pungent ale yeast to go with this. Triple on steroids and only not too sweet because of big hop additions. Characteristic De Molen yet still Belgian style yeast and palate profile. Goes towards some of De Molens maltier IPAs or better yet towards their barley wines yet less smooth, sweet and alcohol. Yes, it is a mix between styles and has lots of its wown character, but without looking into the beer world extremes Im sure it wont be highly regarded in the end. I do.

3283,"2013-04-03",2.9,"Bottle:
Medium sized, vast but with regular speed changing, creamy beige colored foamy head on top of a hazy warm orange to wam red colored beer.
Aroma has a lot of fruity hop aromas like a dipa: citrus, apricot, peach and mango. But if this dominates the aroma, say with a 60%, the other 40% is mostly alcohol with some sprinkles of grains and yeast.
Flavours of plant extracts, green grass, pretty strong chalk and old wood toast, alcohol (light hint of warmth and spice but mostly its a clean alcohol taste), yeast and some hints of fruit like peach and apricot. 
Damn that alcohol burn... Pfff
Aftertaste is a mix of alcohol and some warmth, chalk, wood aged fruit extracts with some yeast.
Low to medium carbo, soft yet spicy mouthfeel, more than a medium and close to fuller body and a bit of a watery texture.
Aroma is ok, taste is less ok-->bit unbalanced with strange ingredients and that alcohol bite.
I could not finish it...","Best of E-Town mit 2 Brauhausen, NETHERLANDS","Countbeer"

Wow, taste is something different than I expected. Sweet fruitiness, some roasty caramel, quite some alcohol burn. I cant really point out the yeast-species (despite being probably belgian), because of all kinds of other flavors, which at times clash a bit.
