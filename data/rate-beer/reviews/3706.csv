3706,"2017-04-11",4.0,"I bought this bottle in the hipercoop in Kriens. I drank it tonight at home, relax, tired after our slavery work of this sad word of neoliberalism, happy to dream a little, to read Zola or Hannah Arendt and to avoid this poor T.V and happy to drink this beer with a nice sweetness side, giving to me the time to contemplate the nature. The body is like an Irish ale, copper and brown color, normal carbonation, thin and white foam. The taste is well balanced, a bit watery, pleasant side of vanilla, toffee, malty but not bready like a lager, some hop, a bit crispy but the sensation is in the mouth pleasant, next pint please!!!!","Lausanne/Sevilla/Lima, SWITZERLAND","caribou43"
