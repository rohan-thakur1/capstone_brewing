This hopfenweizen has all a hopfenweizen should have.
Hazy apricot yellow colour with rich foam. Intense 뇮reen hop nose with tropical fruits along with tinny phenols with notes of cloves and white pepper. Mouthfeel is medium to full-bodied and soft leaning towards oily and the flavour profile presents a great balance of banana esters, hefeweizen-yeast and new world hops. Amazing how all these three can be so prominent at the same time. I like the fact that it뇹 not overcarbonated. Bitterness is medium. A tad too much yeast perhaps making the flavours less clear but that뇹 nothing to go uff da about. Great beer!","G칬teborg, SWEDEN","rickgordon"

Taste is slightly malty, slightly bitter, estery, fruity and floral with wheat crackers, unripe banana, chives, freshly cut grass, pine needles, gooseberries, cloves, unripe mango, unripe pineapple and orange zest. Mouthfeel is soft, dry, astringent and light to medium bodied.

Bit green in the hop profile with prominent chives. Possibly too fresh... Will revisit...Re-rate! Sampled several times since the first rating.
