Hope the beer stands up to being a little under-fresh. 

It is nearly midnight and Ive been in the garden all day grafting, my garden looks a picture and Im thirsty, this is the beer Ive choosen to quench my thirst! Slotted into the fridge early evening, so the review is of a cooled rather than cold Oldgott.

Poured in one, into my huge Judas tulip glass. The bottle opened with a resounding crack and poured a cloudy orange, dirty dull amber colour. On top of the body sat a full, well formed white foaming head. The head did fall away, but lacing and some foam was still there at the end.

Aroma is Belgian to my nose, a sweet and sour mix with yeast and spices trying to grab your nasal hairs.

Sour, like a lambic, is it off or should it taste like this? I think the vinegar fly might have got in my bottle.

Only 5.2%ABV, but the sourness masks even that lowly strenght, strange, wierd and not very friendly in my opinion.

Not what I was expecting, reasons? Maybe the date, maybe the bottle is off, maybe not cold enough, maybe I should have poured it more sedately, but this beer was a let down (and not cheap, even at its brewpub).","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

The aroma is based in sweet, honeyed cereal grain malt, touching also on toasted bread, cracker, dry grass, and bitter florals.  For me, the cereal is overly assertive and kind of stale.  The flavor is equally unimpressive, again based in dry cereal grain, drinking stale (even though I know its not).  Bitter grasses and heavy cereal outweigh tertiary bread character.  Meh.  The palate drinks heavier than it should, laden with excessive sugars that the moderate carbonation cannot overcome.  The grassy, grainy, cereal-heavy finish is long and unpleasant.

This beer was so overwhelmed by diacetyl that it tasted like a liquid butterscotch candy without the sugar.   Extremely disappointing, given the high quality of all other beers in Prague.

I cant believe anyone could review this beer and not notice this massive flaw.   I asked the bartender if it was a bad batch, but apparently it always tastes this way.   Buttered popcorn is great, but not in beer.    If you want a test beer to see what diacetyl (and the failure to aerate your wort before piching yeast), this is the one.","USA","Peej"

I will state that it was ok at the brewpub but other than a semi watery body and looking pretty in the glass  with a nice head, it was average at best.  I suppose that it doesnt age gently in the tanks there and is quite delicate in that respect.  The bottle I brought home and was shared with sloth ended up killing the lawn where it was dumped since it had soured and gotten funky.

In short: An amazing woody pilsner.  Different and trully excellent.
How: Tap at brewpub (U Medvídků, Prague)
The look: Partly cloudy golden copper body with a large creamy beige head
In long: Nose and taste are not intense but really out of this world.  Oak and wood very present and harmoniously tied to the various smooth fruity flavours of tropical fruits, citrus and even strawberries.  This is the closest thing (the only thing) I found in Czech Republic that had a similar flavour profile as the Unfiltered un-pasteurized aged in wooden barrel Pilsner Urquell that we get at the end of the Pilsner brewery tour.  This one was a bit sweeter with more caramel and bigger fruit profile but not enchanting.  How can a brewery make such amazing beers on tap and such terrible bottles.

Unbelievably bad.  Heres the story.  First they brought me the wrong thing, a mug of draught Budvar.  Took 10-15 minutes to get them to take that off the table and bring the Medvicku bottle.  Poured it and bang, instant whiff of vinegar.  Got the waiter over (who at this point was probably already irritated) and asked if it smelled normal to him.  He actually drank some out of my glass, said it was fine.  He got his manager to come over, also said it was fine.  Ok, ok, its fine, Im sorry.  Vinegar is normal for this beer apparently.  I didnt drink more than a few sips, paid, and bought the X33 from the desk on the way out...and found it was almost as terrible when I got back to the hotel.  Sure, its possible I lucked upon two bad batches of two different beers, but I still dont like those odds.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

2762,"2006-02-28",3.2,"On tap in U Medvidku Praha: Hazy, amber coloured, creamy, quite stable off-white head; sweet-malty nose with a heavy herbal, almost medical hoppiness; moderate bitter, only faint sweetish flavour, quite light-bodied; rather dry, hoppy finish. Pleasant and hoppy, a bit too slim......................","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"
2762,"2005-08-07",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 24, 2008 On tap at the brewpub in 2005:

The Lure:Took about 10 minutes to pour, so obviously a sumptuous head was served atop. Smooth caramel dripping onto the shy hops. Great malt display, but somewhat linear to my nostrils. 

The Festivities:Luscious extraction of round maltiness, where caramel, faint butterscotch, and sly mineral notes dabble with the soft, low carbonation. A whispering hop tinge is swiftly washed away by the malts. Very well executed technically, but ultimately a little boring to me in its one and only direction.

Transcendence:Morning toast; sustaining and easy.

On tap at the brewpub in 2008:
A stupendous fruity caramel maltiness benefited from perfectly integrated wooden, herbal hop notes which so efficiently teamed up with the oaken barrel flavors. Its superb body, immense drinkability and inherent complexity made for a most smashing Polotmavé. 4.2/5","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
