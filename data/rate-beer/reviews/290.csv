290,"2016-11-06",4.5,"Yields a completely hazed yellow-golden mango pulp color with a fluffy, stable white head.

Smells of a very intriguing hop plethora, with just the lightest note of cakey malts, perfectly complimenting to the orange quality of the hops. Also packs lime zest, wet grass a hint of dried blueberries and fresh fallen leaves.

Has a fantastic smooth, fuller bodied mouthfeel with a lively finish, never loosing any of its softness on the tongue. While turning remarkably dry, especially during the finish, the beer stays in perfect balance throughout, due to light white bread malts.

Shines from the very first moment by its world class mouthfeel, which is incredibly creamy and soft, slowly inviting fruity hops to the palate. Lemon pulp, orange peel and some unripe mango get amped up by a pleasant, adapting onion sharpness and soothing wet grass. Its only indication that this is an 8 abv beer is its doughy malt balance, which gets recognizable by rounding out the hop melange, providing just a hint of sweet maltiness - the beer drinks incredibly easy. Looses its fruitiness during late mid palate, slowly getting replaced by more silkness and an intense, long lasting lemon and leaf dryness, producing a short, earthy ginger peak. 

Very impressive double ipa, gaining much of its greatness from the incredibly silk mouthfeel, while its perfectly hop composition does the rest. Awesome how this develops on the palate, turns from fruity to herbal to dry - always soothed by soft malts, very well pronounced and clean.","GERMANY","aleigator"

A really well made DIPA. It goes to show you, though, how far the style has come that this no longer stands out in the field of amazing hop bombs that are out there. The hops are well used and theres a great interplay of flavor from the dry hops with a stronger-than-expected hop bitterness at the back of the palate. The malt profile is light and rightfully focuses on the hop characteristics. A great IPA that you should try if you get the chance, just dont be surprised if it reminds you of some of your favorite local DIPAs.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

In the same ballpark as Legitimacy, though this one is stickier, danker and, if less bright and lively, more powerful and yet calm. Malts are wrapped around the hops ever-so-gently for balance, and whlie there are touches of pine here and there, its never a major problem. Succulent conifer, spicy spruce, dry black cherry-meets-white grapefruit...the list goes on and its a complex, enjoyable and very aromatic ode to the hop. Little if any alcohol noted.Dry in the mouth, with tangy grapefruit, more dank, wet, floral bud-like notes and spicy, moderately to heavily bitter acids on the end. The mouthfeel is as creamy as they come for an IPA, with moderate to low carbonation and plentiful stickiness. I could do with a touch less pine/grapefruit tanginess and a bit more dryness/crispness on the end, from the malts, but otherwise, this is sublime stuff and a very easy to drink DIPA given all of the citrus and such.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Wow, hops. A great citrus hop aroma, backed up by a hint of sweetness. Smells pretty damn good. A lot like the smell, but in three distinct stages. An initial great citrus hop flavor, but it seems to be gone by the time I get the taste of the malt. Caramel malt and a bit of sweetness, almost independent of the hops. Then the malt sweetness fades, yielding a bitterness in the finish. None of the flavors seem to flow together. The odd distinction of flavors takes away. It makes it feel thick at points and thin at others. Strange. I originally rated this in 2011 and gave it a 4.1, back when I thought every beer was a 4+.

290,"2014-08-22",4.0,"This is one of the out of the blue beer moments for me. My wife works for a large company and has someone working under her that has talked about untapped and good beer in the past and she had shared that I was into that stuff. He went to Hill Farmstead this past week and returned with a growler of Abner and two cans of Heady Topper for me as a gift. Holy cow beer jackpot! Pour has a sunset orange color and a thin coating of white head. Interesting that there is some heavy chunks of hop looking sediment at the bottom of the growler. Aroma has bright bold hops, resins, dry citrus rind, pine, wet hop flowers, and a poke of alcohol. Mouth feel is medium without crushing you with hop bitterness and there is a gentle carbonation. Flavor again is clearly a hop showcase, resins, citrus, pine, and a dry finish. There is a bit of sweetness to the malt that cuts into the hops smoothing out the whole thing. This is a refreshing treat because the bitterness is well under control and there is no onions in the hop profile at all. Nice and drinkable for a double and there are not many that can make that claim. As I continue to drink the growler it really strikes me that the malt side is equally as important as the hops and both are allowed to shine through.","Connecticut, USA","blklab2007"

290,"2013-06-28",4.7,"I poured a 750ml growler into a tulip glass (thanks Jon, for the bottle!). Im not sure of the date of the bottle. It cost $12 ($0.47 per ounce).

Appearance: Bright pale orange/dark yellow hue. Extremely hazy. Forms a large, white, frothy head which laces and retains very well.

Smell: A wonderful, pungent nose of tropical fruits (guava, passion fruit, mango) and citrus (grapefruit and tangerine). Some pine and flowers as well.

Taste: Its hard for me to even begin to review beers like this. Hill Farmstead has been so hyped up by the fanboys that I figured theres no way any brewery could live up to such acclaim. Well I cant speak for the entire brewery, but I do have to admit that ""Abner"" is definitely a top notch double IPA. Its exactly what I look for in beers of the style: intoxicating aroma; a delicious, well-balanced palette; and its highly drinkable. 

This could easily be confused for a San Diego brew as it has all the makings of a Stone or Ballast Point brew. Theres a delectable juicy flavor that starts things off: grapefruit, guava, passion fruit, et al, are all present immediately. Theres a slight sweetness and an almost juice-like taste across the tongue. Its actually quite refreshing for a moment there, that is until the bitterness comes in. Its not quite as aggressive as some others of the style, though its noticeably strong for sure. I get a garlic and onion taste at the apex, though theyre quickly chased away by dry bitterness. Theres a slight spiciness on the finish, but it fades away and leaves a nondescript aftertaste of hop bitterness. 

I have to say I was extremely pleased with this beer, though its taste is a bit familiar. There are comparable alternatives sitting on shelves of beer stores nationwide, but being able to experience this rare opportunity was a pleasant surprise and worth the money.

Drinkability: Hill Farmstead Abner drinks the way a double IPA should. Its got the crispness of a standard IPA, but with a slightly thicker, softer texture. Its quite comfortable in the mouth and goes down super smooth. Sure, the hops do linger and dry out the palate, but thats to be expected from this type of beer. At 8.2% ABV its definitely a strong, robust beer all around, but theres no alcohol taste or warmth to be found anywhere. I had no trouble drinking the entire bottle myself.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Big tropical fruit nose; even more than Society and Solitude #3 had, whiffs of mango, papaya, orange peel, and even some lemon.  Quite herbal with also a touch of grass.  The color is a hazy rusty gold with a thin off-white head settling on top.  This is a very clean hoppy Double IPA.  Its floral, herbal, with some light sweet malt, and very tropical tasting; pineapple, mango, grapefruit, and a touch of coconut make for a very tasty hop bomb.  The bitterness is assertive but far from abrasive.  Some sticky alcohol heat does show in the finish but that comes with making an 8% hoppy beer.  Its really quite refreshing and easy to drink.

290,"2012-05-12",4.4,"Served in a goblet at Canal St, Reading.

Pours a cloudy, glowing peachy amber with a thick creamy white head. Average retention and abundant streaks of sticky lacing. 

Aroma is a little disappointing. Abundant resin and citrus hops dominate; more sweet than bitter. Pleasant, but a little one dimensional.

Body is thicker side of medium, chewy and smooth with strong carbonation. Flavor adds more complexity than the nose with a mild peach sweetness on the front of the palate with grapefruit and citrus resiny bitterness on the back. Throughout there is a light lemon rind, grass and strong bready malt flavors balancing the hops. At colder temperatures this reminded me of something like Ruination, but as this warmed it turned into a unique beast of an IIPA. This was maltier than some other hop bomb IIPAs; combined with the lower alcohol and unique peach flavors this is highly drinkable and recommended.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","yourefragile"

A - Pours a hazy orangish/red, a fingers-worth of off-white head, spotty lacing, and a thin cap.

290,"2012-03-12",3.8,"From notes.  First reviewed 9/28/2011.  Poured from a 64 oz. growler into a tulip. Thanks to idrinkgas for sending this over.

Out of the growler, my pour has a nice creamy froth of a white head above a cloudy tangerine beer. Pretty nice retention from a growler.

Some lightly sweet crackery malt wafts into my nose first, but the aroma is full of hops. Floral, some grassy, lots of grapefruit, and a bit of spicy pine. Very nice.

A good amount of biscuity malt does its best to stand up to the hops, but fairly quickly the tidal wave of hops wins. A balanced hop presence - grapefruit citrus, some grass, and some prickly pine. The finish is fairly clean.

Abner has a balanced full body, a little bit of booze. Smooth, creamy carbonation. Lightly grainy, not much hop oil left on the tongue after each sip.

This is a well made, balanced, hop bomb. Very good, I have no qualms about finishing a decent portion of this growler.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

poured from growler into a Sam Adams glass

Nose: strong floral hops with a bit of sweet alcohol
Appearance: Thin head that dissapates quicky, beautiful cloudy golden in color
Taste: I can find nothing wrong with this beer.  Potent hoppy grapefruit with a very nice, lasting, slightly bitter finish.  No floral or sweet notes as I noticed in the smell, but just perfect.  Finished the 750ml growler over a three day period and found it more pleasurable with each pour.  On day 2 and 3 I had it in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass, and I think that made it even better as the aromas came out a bit more.

One last note, on day three I followed my last Abner with my 2nd-ever Heddy Topper.  Both beers weigh in at 8%+ APV with no inidication of being this strong, and both are wonderful, but for my money, Abner wins this head-to-head Vermont competition :)","Maine, USA","jmilo64"

Beer is mildly hazy, orangish in color and has a wispy head that leaves some lacing, carbonation moderate to low.

Aroma is nice and piny with a little citrus in there as well, no malt. So far so good.

I like this beer too. Thinner than Kryptonite but not watery, the bitterness is spot on, no malt up front with a nice palate of great great pine, earth and citrus hops. Most drinkable out fo the bunch for sure.

290,"2012-02-24",4.8,"As soon I popped the top on this growler I was attacked with a huge hoppy presence.  Grapefruit is huge!  Citrus isnt lagging far behind and a piney aroma brings up the rear.  I could of sat there all night long just taking in the aroma of this beer.  Amazing!

Now a lot of the time iyoull hear me say something like The taste doesnt match the aroma  Not here.  I think the taste is actually better than the aroma.  The hop profile here isnt clean.  Instead its a deep hop aroma.  Its hard to explain other than say its a dank and dirty and its just over the top fantastic.  Huge amount of grapefruit, citrus, and pine.  It just sits there, lingers  There seems to be some other tropical fruits mixed in there but the grapefruit and citrus take frontstage and run away with the show.  You can tell this beer is dry hopped big time.  It just sits in the mouth.  Theres a slight bitterness to it that comes in about half way and lingers just a tad on the aftertaste.  Everything about this beer just worked for me.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, chewy, and leaves a bit of a dryness on the palette.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","drunkenpolack"

A - Pours hazy orange with a small half finger tall white head leaving small wisps of lacing down the glass.

S - Smells of citric hops, grapefruit, pine, bready malt, and a touch of caramel sweetness. The nose was good but when you have a Double Citra sitting right beside it there really isnt much of a comparison. Still very nice tho.

T - Starts off with a nice grapefruit kick quickly giving way to a mix of light citric hops, caramel sweetness and some dry chewiness. Very nice overall balance throughout. Finish is a touch dry with some lingering hop bitterness. Pretty good but not as good as the other hoppy HF beers.

M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Slick, chewy, feel with plenty of lingering hop bitterness in the finish.

O - I enjoyed this one quite a bit but when you compare it to the other hoppy Hill Farmstead beers it is clearly fourth or fifth best. Not knocking it one bit as it is still an awesome beer, just not as good as some of the other HF hoppy beers.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

290,"2011-12-05",4.2,"Poured into a snifter. Thanks to CharlieMurphy for this.

4.0 A: Opaque medium orange color. Just under two fingers of creamy white head. Retention is about average and a small ring of lacing is left.

4.5 S: Nose on this is wonderful! Tons of tropical fruits. Mango, pineapple, papaya, and orange in descending order. Grapefruit and pine to a lesser extent. Despite the haziness, there is little in terms of yeast and is super clean overall. Malts are negligible save for a touch of neutral sweetness.

4.5 T: Taste is as good as the nose. There are a lot of DIPAs that are jampacked with fruitiness in the nose that doesnt also occupy the taste, but this isnt one of them. Ample amounts of mango, orange, and pineapple. A little less papaya. The grapefruit and pine are much more pronounced. Again, some balancing neutral malt sweetness and surpringly clean. Bitterness starts out quite soft, but progresses to mild-moderate halfway into the glass.

4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Moderately creamy. Good here.

4.5 D: Hill Farmstead has to be one of the best breweries in the world. Everything they make is great. After having another killer DIPA, its safe to say that theres no question that they know what to do with hops. Solid brew all around.

The nose is very interesting; raw, earthy bursts of citrus and simcoe, some herbal tea notes, pine. The flavor is unconventional in some ways, and considering the number of India Pale Ales, that is difficult. A smooth rich citrus flavor, very light bitterness initially, orange peel, some resin, lemons. Finishes very smooth with lingering bitterness just like an orange peel. This beer is only lacking a robust palate which certainly could be from the transportation to Utah. It has a earthy unique flavor which is simple and yet awesome.

290,"2011-02-06",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2012 My Bottom Line:
Citrusy, floral hops and lean straw-like cereals evolve in a soft mouthfeel, leading to levelled piney bitterness for a paradoxically easygoing, intense Double IPA.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy veil of foam laces around the hazy blond.
-Every ingredient is expressed clearly and harmoniously. This is very drinkable too for a Double IPA, especially if you compare it to Lawsons (excellent) Double Sunshine and Hopzilla, which are brasher in the finish.
-The soft, natural carbonation and svelte mouthfeel make for optimal drinkability, which is very dangerous at this abv!
-Shaun is one of those brewers which make you realize how disappointing most brewers can be. Plain evil, I say. ;)

290,"2010-12-10",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2013 In short: A vibrant fruity and floral hop bomb.  Great IIPA.
How: Tap at the brewery
The look: Partly cloudy shining golden body topped by a large off-white head with good retention a leaving plenty of lacings.  Perfect look.
In long: Nose is vibrant with fruity hops (tropical fruits) and a strong floral character.  Taste is mostly about the hops.  The malt backbone is solid enough to support this hop monster but the crisp toasted bready malts with a bit of caramel play second violin to the hops.  Assertive hopping that is both refreshing (tropical fruits), floral and with a resinous edge that takes the bitterness level to the medium-high range.  Long sticky hops resin after-taste.  This beer was described by the brewer as an Imperial Edward (their basic APA).  As much as I like Abner, and IT IS excellent, I still slightly prefer the highly sessionnable Edward.

If more brewers took chances in the brewing process they might be able to achieve a beer like this instead of throwing a bunch of junk in the pot and saying wow look at our double mumbo jumbo bad ass triple hoppy blah blah blah IPA.  Shaun Hill is cranking out beer that is totally unhooked.  The guy is competing with himself right now.  People whine about the price.  They should drink something else if they arent willing to pay an extra buck for something outstanding that doesnt match their expectations of what lazy brewers have set as the standard American Double IPA.","St. Johnsbury, Vermont, USA","mariano42"
290,"2010-07-14",3.8,"Growler shared by ygtbsm94 on 6/6/10: Pours a transparent bright bronze with a spotty-lacing off-white head.  Has a fresh resiny grapefruity hoppy nose with some sweet pale malty undertones.  Starts with good fullness and rich sweet caramel malty nose with a resiny grapefruity hoppy flavor and bitter balance toward a drier bittersweet finish.  A pretty nice double IPA.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
290,"2010-07-10",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 20, 2010 Re-rate 101020. ­On tap at Brewery.
Appearance : Hazy yellow with a creamy head. Lots of lacing.

Aroma : Intense fruity and leafy hops. Nice mangos and passion fruits. Fresh apricots/peaches. 

Taste : Fruity and leafy with notes of mangos and a bit of white sugar. Intense hops. Finish is a bit warm with intense hops. A tiny bit mineral also.

Overall : This has nothing to do with the one I had at Farmhouse (see rating below). Nose is very intense with awesome fruity notes. Taste has intense green and leafy hops. Very fresh. Rather drinkable even if a tiny bit hot on the finish. Another great beer from Shaun that Im glad I could re-rate !


On tap at Farmhouse Tap and Grill.
Appearance : Nice clear amber with no head.

Aroma : Very VERY peachy, very fruity with lots of mangos.

Taste : Fruity peaches and mangos. Quite hoppy but not very bitter. Palate is dead flat.

Overall : Nice fruits (a bit too much maybe) but carbonation is way too soft. Looks like my glass stayed in the fridge all night. Rather unidimensional, fruits and not much else. I think the beer had something wrong, Id be glad to give it another chance...","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"
290,"2010-07-10",3.9,"Nice full body once its poured with a fluffy head. Aroma is sweet, hoppy, rich, caramel, juicy hops and resin. Flavor is big, juicy, some caramel and rich full malt body with lots of hops. Citrus and pine hops but not overly bitter. Alcohol seems to be well hidden too.","Kingston, New York, USA","yobdoog"
290,"2010-07-09",4.4,"Thanks to weearenot3.6 for sharing.  Pours a lightly hazy golden orange with a medium bubbly creamy white head.  Aroma of pine resin, orange, tea and light caramel.  Flavor was very resiny, grapefruit, pine, tea, nice and dry, bitterness was there but so smooth.  I would have called this one Lebron though.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
290,"2010-07-08",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 9, 2011 Poured a medium and clear amber color with a smaller sized head. Aromas of floral hops, skunky weed, and some lighter fruitiness. Tastes of floral, citrus, and some caramel.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"

290,"2010-07-01",4.1,"Shenandoah Throwdown, growler, thanks peregrinari.   Another delicious one from Hillstead.  I found this one to be a little sweeter and heavier than the citra, but still very well made and delicious.  Alcohol well hidden.  Very tasty, Id love to try it on cask.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
290,"2010-06-29",4.0,"Orange-brown pour with a thin white head.  Lots of piny herbal hops on the nose.  Good balanced dry pine flavor with strong malt notes.  Herbal hops with notes of pine and grapefruit.  Very bitter.  Excellent IPA.","Seattle, Washington, USA","EricE"
290,"2010-06-23",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 9, 2011 On tap at Farmhouse Tap and Grill in Burlington. Hazy copper pour, 1 finger semi-dense white head. Aroma is absolutely packed with pine and spruce notes, with citrus, floral, and dank grass notes forming a strong background- even from the nose, one can tell this is an absolute resin bomb. Flavor is similar, though the citric sweetness comes out a bit more prominently to balance the heavy bitterness beautifully. Palate is awesome; incredibly crisp and drinkable for an 8.2 percent DIPA that is super dank. Still has that big body, but glides down so smoothly. The mouthfeel puts this beer in the top echelon for the style. Awesome.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
290,"2010-06-21",3.9,"Plenty of citrus, pine, herbal and floral hop character in the nose along with deep malt sweetness.  Beautifully clear, dark orange-golden body is topped by a decent white head that lasts well and sticks to the sides of the glass.  Strong bitterness hits the tongue first with a follow through of very sweet malts chased by grapefruit, orange, floral and pinelike hop flavours in succession.  Medium full body with moderate to strong carbonation that keeps it from becoming too sticky.  Sampled on tap at the brewery.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
290,"2010-06-08",3.6,"Sampled at DC Epic Sour Tasting 2010.  Pours a crystal clear, orange amber with a thin, creamy white head.  Nice aroma, oranges, caramel, flowers, pine, candy.  Flavor is bitter, lemons, grapefruit, white pepper, light candy.  Full bodied, bitter and a touch salty.  The bitterness is the star here and theres enough light sweetness to keep it from being overpowering.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
290,"2010-06-07",3.7,"UPDATED: NOV 22, 2011 Growler courtesy of ygtbsm94. Pours a clear light orange with a thin, white head that leaves no lace. Aroma is dank fresh hop, bright citrus, passionfruit. Taste is dry overall with massive resinous hops. Really insanely hop-forward and lacking complexity. 6/7/2010 8/3/7/4/14=3.6Growler thanks to oteyj. Pours a glowing, deep, muddy orange- hazy. Medium, off-white head. Webby, bigger lace. Nose is sugary apricot, vanilla, jackfruit, pineapple, sugary braised kumquat. Moves to sugar artificial orange Gatorade powder with meaty melon characters. Taste is bright, astringent, quite tart/acidic and big lemon. Grapefruit sections. Lacks finesse. Way too rip your head off for me. 11/22/2011 8/4/7/4/14=3.7","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

290,"2010-05-31",4.4,"Pouring at the opening of Hill Farmstead.  Had this both on draught and cask and while the draught was good, the cask was just phenomal and I went back to it 4 or 5 times once it was tapped.  Just great stuff.  Pours a nice clear amber on draft, and a little more haze on the cask version, big creamy white head.  Large pine and soft citrus, which on cask is just blown away by the dripping passion fruit and piles of tropical fruit.  Medium bodied, smooth malt.  Cask picks up a light sweetness with some pineapple tones.  Smooth long grapefruit finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
290,"2010-05-30",5.0,"[Various cask samples] Hazy to cloudy dark golden color with a medium sized, white head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of pine, citrus, grass, grapefruit, tropical fruits, toast, and herb-like qualities.  Taste was resiny with pine, orange, citrus fruits, grassy, with light earthiness, and a bitter hop finish.  This one will put you in another world.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
