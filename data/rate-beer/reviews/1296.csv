The taste is balanced between citrus/grassy hop bitterness and a sweet biscuity malt. The palate is average. Not bad, better than average but not great.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
1296,"2011-09-15",3.6,"Draft Mostly clear burnt-orange ale with a small, creamy, off-white head. Decent retention. The aroma is both toasty and biscuity. Medium to full-bodied with a 2%-milk mouthfeel and lively carbonation. The flavor is medium to heavily bitter with an undertone of toasted barley. Finishes crisp and bitter. Holy shit a bitter that is actually bitter! More like a highly hopped American brown ale.Very nice.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
1296,"2011-09-12",4.1,"Review from notes at Cigar Citys taproom on 9/9/11 for Firkin Friday. 

Draft poured into a 4 oz. sampler glass.

Appearance: Poured a medium caramel brown with golden highlights. Nice lacing.

Smell: Sweet malt with a touch of bitter hops.

Taste: Grassy hops up front followed by lightly roasted malt in the middle before ending with a nice bitter finish. Aftertaste is bitter as well. Very nice flavor.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied with a decent amount of carbonation.

Drinkability: Very good drinkability. You could drink several. Goes down smooth.

Overall: Good beer overall. One of the better ESBs Ive had (while I havent had a ton, I know this one is good). Worth trying.","Fort Myers, Florida, USA","adam42381"

The aroma picked up soft redder fruits and caramel with earthy and floral accents.. soft, fairly supple, and pleasant.  The flavor found similar stuff.. redder fruit, caramel, and honeysuckle at the core.. fresh earth and floral bitterness around (moderate at most).. finished dry and just a little bitter.. well-balanced.  Light-medium bodied and quite dry on the palate.. OK mouthfeel.. I could drink a whole lot, but since there are like 20 new stouts here, I wont.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

1296,"2011-06-05",3.6,"Poured up on tap at Cigar City Brewing Tap room with deep clear copper body and off white head. The modest aroma offers up some sweet light skin like fruity esters, some roasted malts and wet hop spiciness. The taste enters pretty crisp and fresh with apricot and cherry like fruity esters mingling with fresh spicy hoppiness, a bit of lemon and then a modest level of roasted malts. The taste seems to dry out a tad into the finish.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

The aroma shows caramel, toasted almond, light citrus, and even some pine.  Flavors follow, offering a nice balance of sweet caramel/doughy malt and fruity hops to go with a toasty element.

Nose is nondescript but small cinnamon and herbal spice can be coaxed. Taste is spicy rye, nutty bitter (not hoppy biter but more like gruit bitters such as twigs and forest articles). Earthy, piney, and guit-like bitter. Interesting.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
