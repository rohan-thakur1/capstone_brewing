Wygląda jak widać :P Nie ma się co tu nad tym rozwodzić. Piana opada szybko i nic z niej nie zostaje, no ale umówmy się, nie o pianę w tym piwie chodzi. 

Zapach słodkiego wina, suszone śliwki, daktyle, generalnie suszone ciemne owoce, aż momentami wrażenie lekkiej wędzonki od tych suszonych owoców, lekki zapach wina z czarnych porzeczek, słodycz, trochę opiekanych zapachów, lekkie belgijsko-fenolowe przyprawy, ale naprawdę lekkie. Bardzo bogaty aromat. 

W smaku równie bogate. Typowy Quad w stronę suszonych owoców, przypraw jest mniej, ale wyczuwalne. Słodkie, ale nie bardzo pełne. Lekkie posmaki winne również obecne. Trochę opiekania i tej wędzonki od suszonych owoców. Wysycenie nie za wysokie. Ogólnie petarda.

Looks: Opague Cola brown colour with a thin layer of yeast sediments; Very thin head with residual light beige foam which fades in 15 seconds. Fair sticky lacing with near zero carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant dark malt, with strong barrel, red wine, vanilla, strong caramel, sticky toffee, dark fruits, dark chocolate, coffee, cream, sugar, spices, strong Bel yeast, biscuits, lemon and light grass. Complex and nice!

Taste: Strong sweet dark malt, with caramel, dark fruits, light toffee, strong alcohol, red wine, barrel, red fruits, coffee, nice syrup, spices, strong Bel yeast, lime cordial, close to medium bitter hops and grass.

Body: Full body. Very slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Fairly good dark maltyness in a slightly thick ground. Slick and very nice sugar syrup hits first, followed by layers of red wine, caramel, coffee, red fruits, strong booze, dark fruits and spices spinning around. Lime cordial to round, complex and really nice!

Booze: the 10% is slightly warming even in sips, but combined with the tasty syrup and red wine barrel almost perfectly. Treat it with respect and youll have a neat session!

Hoppiness: Lemon and light grassin nose. Lime cordial and grass in taste; Bitterness is mostly from liquorices for a lasting, close to mid astringent sweet malty finish.

After Taste: Slightly dry. Vinous and sweet boozy to mouth.

Comments: This one is just as strong and dark as most Struise Ales, with a remarkably red winey character to grace its complex aroma and taste. Its also strongly sweet but in a very pleasant way, work so well with toffee and chocolate-like dark maltyness. Definitely a cellar material for better tasting with age.

2325,"2016-03-19",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2016 New Struise quadrupel named after a Thelonious Monk jazz standard - and when Urbain does a new quad, the beer geek world knows about it, as this beer has been receiving tons of attention lately. Medium thick, pale yellowish beige, lightly lacing, moussy head dissipating in the middle but otherwise well retaining; burgundy robe with wine red hue, hazy, very dark but still translucent. Rich bouquet of everything a good quadrupel (or abt) should offer: a ton of brown sugar, toffee, ripe banana (but not in the bubblegum way), cherry bonbons, maple syrup, cashew nuts, ruby port, some subtle vanilla, something vaguely soapy (lavender almost), candied fig, honey-glazed spare ribs, marzipan, toasted bread, chamomille, something subtly meaty, hint liquorish candy, cake dough, pear, brown rum, unmistakable fresh paint solvents but well hidden in all these other odours, lovely whiff of oak bringing it all together without becoming too intrusive but gaining strength as it warms up (and so does the meaty factor, by the way). Quite heavy onset of overripe peach, fig and dried banana with a lot of candi sugar sweetness on top but a deep basic sourishness for balance as well, though the sweetness dominates, along with unmistakably meaty umami flavors. Soft carbo, big and thick but soft and fluffy mouthfeel, bit resinous; thick layer of sweet caramelly and bittersweet toasted maltiness ensues, while the initial dark sugar and beautifully restrained fruit sweetness continue, all leading to a very satisfying, rich finish, malt and brown sugar sweet with becoming cloying, as this sweetness is balanced by a late, earthy, lightly peppery hop bitterness, a drying oaky effect which remains subtle and discreet, and the expected glow of warming, yet non-astringent, rum-like alcohol. It is good to see that Struise has reconnected with its own past in searching for the perfect quadrupel - after a whole bunch of Pannepot variations, this one is indeed a bit different, more straightforward perhaps, and definitely sweeter. One for those who like their quads sweet and opulent - I can recommend this to e.g. adepts of Rochefort 10 and the like. Interesting, overpowering beer, Struise did it again, though to me it does not quite reach the levels of the best of the Pannepot family. Still, Id sure like to see what becomes of this after five years of cellaring, must prove really interesting...","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

2325,"2016-03-07",3.4,"Vintage 2013. Thanks kajser! Shared with him, ogivlado and franski. Murky brown body, creamy thick tan head. small but somewhat lasting. Interesting aroma, lovely caramel note, sweet and fruity, red grapes maybe, full and nice, just a tad maybe sour, but mostly sweetish. Taste... hmmm... dry caramel, fig jam, dry, a touch of meaty yeastiness. Nice fruity touch, but the rest is just undifined dry caramel. Not that moreish, made worse than the dry finish and aftertaste.","Split / Zagreb, CROATIA","Marko"

2325,"2016-02-28",4.7,"Donkerbruin bier met mokkakleurige schuimkraag die snel wegebt en waar bijna niks van overblijft. Complex aroma en smaak. Hout, vineus, druiven, bessen, beetje rook, (pure) chocolade, lichte caramel. Héél licht zuurtje. Heel erg smaakvol bier die je gerust even mag laten rondgaan in de mond. Wat een smaak !!! Blijft lekker plakken in de mond en geeft een lichte tinteling. Alweer een topcreatie van de (voor mij persoonlijk dan) beste brouwers van de wereld !!","Terneuzen, NETHERLANDS","vincentvega72"

2325,"2016-02-27",4.4,"Fles gekocht bij Vinotake in Waalwijk, nieuw bier van Struise, uitgeschonken in origineel 33 cl. struise bierglas. Diepe donkerbruine kleur, met een fraaie donkerrode gloed. De schuimkraag is medium hoog beige, en trekt zich geleidelijk terug, waarna het typische fijne Struise schuim overblijft. De aromas zijn fruitig en vineus. Met tonen van; rode wijn, fruitigheid van zwarte kersen, rode bessen en licht rokerige houtachtige notities. Het smaakpallet is complex, in een combinatie van karamel zoetheid, gedrenkt in licht zurige rode wijn notities. Fruitige wijn tonen van rood fruit als bessen en kersen, aangevuld met meer aardse en kruidige tonen van chocolade, vanille en licht rokerige hout tannines. De carbonatie is zacht, met een licht rokerige afdronk. Absoluut weer een geslaagd bier deze Blue Monk, typische signatuur van Struise.
