982,"2016-06-20",4.1,"Draft at Gollem in Antwerp during their American weekend. Very thick, lacing, coarse, snow white head over a cloudy, deep peach blonde beer. Aroma of ripe pink grapefruit, moldy lemon, papaja, dough, honey liqueur, strawberry, ripe banana, mango, butter, green plum. Fruity onset, mango, banana, peach, softish carbo, sourish kiwi-like undercurrent, smooth, slick and fluffy malt body, sweetish, honeyish and a tad caramelly while the fruitiness goes on on top of it, yeasty touch in the end paired with a New World hop character, less bittering than aromatic with retronasal orange, pine and grapefruit effects. Could be regarded as a ""Belgian IPA"", which was apparently the intention, the name referring to the Van Eecke classic which is otherwise very different altogether. One for those who have no problems with Belgian yeast traits mingling with New World hop fragrance so I can imagine a concept like this will divide opinions, but in my case: very enjoyable, rich and fun beer to drink.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Aroma of fresh grassy and herbal hops, yeast, pepper, herbs, barnyardie funk and some nice mellow malt - very nice and complex. Medium-bodied; Strong dry and grassy hop flavours up front with some mellow yeast, a touch of light earthy malt and a bit of biscuits tucked inside some herbs. Aftertaste shows a very light and herbal note, some light hop bitterness, but mainly a dry, airy and subtle flavour - nothing overwhelming and nothing too great, actually. Overall, a decent beer, but not showing enough complexity on the finish to be great - the smell is there and complex, but dies after the nose. After sampling too many good belgies in ~2 weeks in Belgium, being home for less than a week made me underappreciate this beer - its good, but simply doesnt compare with real belgies.

Aroma: The nose is clean and hoppy, with some grass, Saison yeast, lemon, and earth

Appearance: It pours a hazed golden-orange color with a huge froth of lacy, off-white head

Flavor: It has light sweetness, lots of grass, spice, and earth, and a light-medium bitter hoppiness

Palate: The body is medium, it has a lively carbonation, feels a touch slick, and has a bit of dryness

Overall Impression: 
This was the first beer Ive tried from Perennial, and I actually quite liked what they did here.  Its almost like an Pale Ale-Saison mixture, but not exactly.  It has a Belgian feel for sure.  I dont know how to classify this, so Belgian Ale seems perfect.  Its a little overly carbonated, which hurts the drinkability a bit, but overall, its really quite enjoyable.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

982,"2012-06-05",3.5,"Draft at Fountainhead and also a bottle from a friend. Pours a deep gold, slight haze. Nose is pils sweet, odd spicy hops from the tap, much better structured from the bottle. Sort of disjointed overall. On tasting, medium bitterness with a distinct pilsner malt sweetness that betrays the balance. The yeast character is nice, moderate spicy notes that work with the hops. Not a bad beer but the draft was just a bit messy. Good from the bottle.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"

982,"2012-05-21",3.4,"On tap at Fountainhead (Chicago, IL). Pours a rich touch dulled golden orange hue, darker with firm haze, healthy glow on the edges. A big cakey offwhite head sits atop, cakes and stays quite large, small lacing overall. Aromas are gentle spicy yeast, mellow pepper, and oranges. Some dry florals and earthy hops, touches of citrus. Mellow bready malts, some more orange, and yeasty life. A firm spice mellow dryness grows. Initial is medium bodied, a firm body with firm sweetness coming in, oranges and dry florals, gentle citrusy hop. Rich yeast, sweeter bready and gentle honey malt influence. Middle offers gentle dryness, richer yeast and fruity malt elements of pear, apple, and citrus. Sweeter middle trails off into a touch of a sticky backend, lacking dryness or refinement. Meh.. A bit sweet for my tastes","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
982,"2012-03-29",3.9,"750 from Wine and Cheese place. Very nice saison/Belgian style that balances the yeast really well. A faint banana yeasty aroma topped with a well balanced yeasty body.

982,"2012-01-28",4.1,"Tasted at the 2012 St. Louis Centennial Beer Festival from magnum bottle into sampler glass. Poured a nice, cloudy, orange-amber color with fluffy off-white foam and good Belgian lace. Strong, sophisticated aroma hops with hints of malt, bread, toast, biscuits, crackers. Hints of apricot, banana, bubblegum, black pepper and clove from Belgian yeast. Light body despite the slightly elevated alcohol percentage, lending an overall dry, ""digestive"" finish. A delicious style, a worthy (albeit inexplicably more expensive) clone of Popperings Hommelbier.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"

982,"2011-11-09",3.7,"Capped 750 from Wine & Cheese in Clayton, MO. Pours hazy dark orange gold with a creamy white head. Aroma is hop with an earthy undertone. Quite promising. Med plus body. Flavor is a little citrus sour, followed by some really earthy hops and yeast/spice notes. Though I guess the earthy is also from the yeast based on the description. If the hops arent earthy tho, Im not sure what they are. Pretty good bitter! Each quaff is a pleasure to both the nose and the mouth. This is pretty good ale.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
