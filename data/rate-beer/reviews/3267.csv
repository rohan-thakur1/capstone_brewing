3267,"2017-06-19",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 20, 2017 Head is uncontrollable, recommend 45 * 10 degree pour if you can on the safe side. Herby light bodied tripel, akin to Karmeliet, big bouquet a bit simplistic compared to the eminent exemplars of the style. I like the location of the moment on the sweetness - sourness - bitterness plane though. A bit citrusy. Hard to complain but hard to extol.","POLAND","ironcontra"
3267,"2017-06-19",1.5,"Bottle - poured with abig white long lasting head, showinf and tasting of some heavy carbonation. It's a blond beer that I found to have a bland boring initial taste, followed yt a funky long unpleasant ending. Not for me!
The alcohol definitely hits hard at 8.5%ABV, but IMHO it's not a pleasant experience and I'd avoid it in future if it was offerered to me free

Palate is fairly pleasant and is both slightly oily and slightly dry. Taste is fresh like spring water, fruity and slightly fermented.

3267,"2017-02-17",4.5,"Voici un bière digne de la tradition brassicole belge. Cette triple ronde, équilibrée et élégante sur des saveurs fruités et à lamertume saillante est une belle réussite de la brasserie Saint Feuillien. Avec un final dune plus grande longueur et des arômes sur des variations un peu plus complexes, cette triple aurait fait partie des très grandes bières dabbaye. En verre, belle prestance avec un blond or limpide (EBC aux alentours de 17) surmonté dune mousse crémeuse, abondante de trois centimètres dépaisseur (initialement saffaissant ensuite quelque peu). Son effervescence est marquée avec une multitude de bulles (diamètre moyen). Le nez est dune intensité moyenne, présente, en compléments des arômes de céréales et de coriandre, des notes fruitées prédominantes. Pomme, poire, pêche, citron....une véritable corbeille de fruits! A la dégustation, lattaque est fraîche, la base aromatique sur les céréales est complétée par une amertume déjà présente, des notes citronnées et une pointe épicée de girofle. Très agréable entrée en matière! La deuxième bouche sadoucit et se densifie. La présence du malt se fait plus marquée avec des arômes fruités de pomme, de pêche relevée dune point poivrée. Lamertume se positionne alors parfaitement, donnant de la fraîcheur à la bière avec une arrière bouche restant sur le malt et les fruits jaunes. Lintensité est bien pensée (EBU de 30) et léquilibre avec lalcool (titrage alcoolique de 8,5 % Abv ) et le sucre maîtrisée. La corpulence est quant à elle moyenne mais suffisante (une densité plus dense laurait rendu très certainement écurante). Lensemble se laisse boire très facilement. Le final laisse alors sexprimer davantage la puissance. Celui-ci est cependant toujours bien intégré et laisse se développer des arômes de guenièvre et des notes poivrées. La longueur, acceptable aurait tout de même pu être plus long et plus brillant afin de trancher davantage par rapport à la base de dégustation, plus douce. Mais ne boudons pas notre plaisir, et laissons nous charmer la rondeur des formes de cette belle.","FRANCE","jybi"

3267,"2015-10-27",3.8,"8.5%ABV. Tripel.

Poured out of the bottle a dirty cloudy yellow amber color. 10ºSRM.

Nose as nice clean light wheaty and malty flavors. Nothing much more beyond that. There is bread dough, whispering about carbs and yeast. There is a clean alcoholic nose as well. I suppose you really shouldnt be asking for more from a well-brewed traditional Belgian tripel. The whole craft beer revolution has brought with it the expectation of something interesting, intriguing or shocking in terms of aroma that we tend to forget the basics and what that means when these foundational principles of brewing are adhered to and produce an ale that really hasnt changed very much in 5 or 6 centuries.

Mouthfeel is aggressively carbonated. This rides on a palate that has all the right malt flavors of graham cracker, wheat toast, barley loaves, caramel with a nice roasty palate of fresh loaves of cracked barley bread. There are bitter hops signaling the end of the palate and encouraging you to take another sip. There is a slightly atypical heaviness to the palate, almost umami, that you definitely dont get off of other tripels like a Karmeliet for example.

Finish is predictaly alcoholic, bitter and brief. There is an aftertaste of what might be considered to be formic acid, the same tangy lightly earthy and claylike flavor note that you get from bitig the butt off a tropical red ant. Slightly longer and more cloying than would be considered proper in todays ""craft"" palate, but then again, Im pretty sure the fine folks at St Feuillens dont reallly care since what theyre selling is whats been done the same way since forever...

3267,"2015-01-01",3.6,"330ml bottle bought at BeYUMMIs booth at HKCEC in Wan Chai during The 12th Hong Kong Food Festival.
Looks: Cloudy hazy straw golden colour with some dirt-like yeast sediments; Two finger head with lasting, crumpety white foams; Moderate sticky lacing and quite fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and sweet malt, with strong pineapple, banana, vanilla, honey, sugar, caramel, raisins, white bread, strong Bel yeast and light lemon. Very pleasing to the nose!

Taste: Medium sweet malt, with light metallic, caramel, light toffee, raisins, light dark fruit esters, molasses, alcohol, light biscuits, Bel yeast, lime, quite strong bitter grassy hops and light grass.

Body: Full body, slick and quite thick palate.

Mouth Feel: Good maltyness but not that rich, body seems a little light despite the thickness. Very strong alcohol undertone throughout but not that boozy. Good caramel but fruity ester is not as vibrant as the aroma. Sweetness works with the booze, not so strong but omnipresent to the tongue. Strong hop dominates. Pretty good!

Hoppiness: Light lemon and some honey floral in nose. Lime and hoppy grass in taste. Bitterness is solid, true to the style, with strong liquorices impression for a lasting, quite strong astringent finish.

After Taste: Slightly dry after taste. Very hoppy and bitter sweet to mouth.

Comments: The one is on my hunting list for quite a while, and I never expected to pick it up at local food fair, so I better start the new year with this unexpected found. Turns out its excellent sweet fruity aroma covers up the rather thin and boozy body. The ester is a slight low but its hoppy to the core like a good Tripel should.

3267,"2014-10-15",3.8,"Transfer from BA review on 4-13-14-

 Served on tap in a chalice glass

 Appearance  The beer is served a amber color with a one finger head of pure white foam. The head fades rather fast, leaving a lighter level of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is light overall with the heaviest of the smells being that of a yeasty and biscuit like aroma. Along with these aromas are some smells of a more floral and spicy nature with the spice being mainly of a clove and coriander.

 Taste  The taste begins with a biscuit malt flavor mixed with a light level of yeastiness and spice. The spice is mainly of a coriander and clove nature with these flavors later being accentuated by some other spice flavors of a pepper and floral spice nature. Flavors of a more citrus nature come to the tongue as the taste advances with orange and tangerine coming to the tongue. Some floral and grassy hops come to the tongue more toward the end of the taste along with some flavors of banana and bubblegum, with the mix of flavors in the end, creating a moderately sweet, but very easy going smooth Belgian flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the medium side for a triple with a carbonation level that is on the slightly lower side. A slightly higher carbonation level may have been slightly better for the fruit flavors of the brew, but overall the feel was rather decent for the style.

 Overall  A very easy drinking triple that hides the alcohol very well. Very inoffensive and rather refreshing and quite drinkable in light of its 8.5% abv. Nothing overly exceptional, but still rather enjoyable. A very neutral Belgian triple.","","Darkmagus82"

Sehr schön süffig. 
Im Hauptteil kommt zu dem cremig-vollmundigen Aroma eine gut dosierte Süße hinzu, wie von überreifen Pfirsichen oder Honigmelonen. 
Im Nachgeschmack sticht der schon erwähnte scharfe Ton deutlich heraus, ansonsten ist er schön rund mir cremig-süßem, langen Nachgeschmack. 
Für meinen Geschmack allerdings einen Tick zu süß. 
Herbe ist kaum wahrnehmbar, höchstens ganz hinten im Nachgeschmack, wo das Bier noch einen kleinen Tick ins Muffige abrutscht. 
--> Sehr interessant!

3267,"2013-02-07",4.9,"St Feuillen triple, un grand travail de cote parce que la brasserie est une habituée 
des hautes performances... La triple dans ce sens doit occuper une place à part,
puisquelle doit être au faîte de la catégorie des blondes...
Voyons dabord sa force : 8,5 % abv, on est au seuil du bon niveau pour la triple.
Couleur jaune foncé, un peu abricot.
Clarté limpide (quand elle est bue jeune), qui a tendance à devenir voilée avec 
lâge, parce quelle reste très vivante à louverture, et donc la levure se mélange
dans ce cas quelque peu à la bière.
Les bulles sont donc nombreuses et quelquefois en rafale dans le verre.
La mousse blanche est épaisse, aérée dans le verre, crémeuse en haut.
Les arômes sont dorge et de fruits mûrs lorsquelle est jeune, et passent à la date 
et au pruneau plus âgée.
La texture est crémeuse et douce.
La 1ère gorgée donne à la fois des céréales et des épices, avec des notes de girofle,
citron, arrière-bouche sur lorge.
La 2ème donne des notes dabricot et une pointe danis étoilé pour la bière jeune,
qui évolue sur un beau relief céréales/fruits mûrs et figues pour la bière âgée.
La 3ème donne déjà en étant jeune de la figue avec une pointe de genièvre,
et on passe à une complexité supérieure avec lâge.
La longueur est belle. La levure souple. La finale douce. Lalcool prenant.
Très belle bière du niveau abbaye clairement, avec un petit côté amer qui
désoiffe, mais les degrés alcooliques sont bien là et donc on est en face dune bière 
sérieuse.
Manque juste une finale brillante, pour briller dun cinq...","BELGIUM","corkyrory66"

The flavor profile is bready malts, caramel, mild funk, florals, spiciness, and some more of the belgian side ; there are some light fruits, peaches and grass. This is an interesting one that really grows, thanks to a unique yeast","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

3267,"2012-02-29",4.3,"Une belle grosse bouteille payée 9.40$.  Je mattarde sur son étiquette et je peux lire que la maison suggère de la consommer avant le 5 avril 2013.  Petit fait cocasse, la vitamine C figure parmi les ingrédients.  Amusant comme tout.  Bon, je termine ce monologue qui ne mène à rien et je mattaque à ce premier verre qui fait très belle figure.  Dans mon fidèle et magnifique verre «Avec les Bons Vux», le liquide dévoile une robe dorée qui est surmontée dune superbe tête blanche.  Une tête mousseuse qui persiste et qui laisse une fine dentelle sur la paroi du verre.  La première chose qui me saute au nez est la très belle présence des épices.  Le girofle me semble bien évident.  Il sinsère ici dans des parfums qui sont explosifs et révélateurs dune très belle complexité : la coriandre et lanis étoilé (五香粉) semblent aussi bien vouloir soffrir avec parcimonie.  Le bouquet fruité qui monte en fines vapeurs est tout aussi intéressant : le nez saiguise sur des fruits tranchants et acidulés.  Quant à la base maltée, elle joue la carte de la bruyante discrétion.  Ni trop fort ni trop faible, le malt se couvre dune fine couche mielleuse qui semble bien connaître son rôle.  Le spectacle continue avec les houblons.  Épicées, mentholées et florales sont autant de caractéristiques qui se collent aux cultivars utilisés dans lélaboration de cette sublime concoction.  Une leçon de maître, véritablement.  Et une fois le pif rassasié, ce sont les papilles qui participent à lévénement.  Des notes citronnées qui attaquent la bouche.  Une présence épicée avec des houblons qui détonnent.  Un blitz contrôlé de notes amères sur la langue.  Des fleurs gigantesques et des herbes.  Une impression en bouche qui est colossale.  Un corps sculptural, féminin, aguichant.  Des bulles qui sont actives, une totale maîtrise du mouvement.  Une texture légèrement huileuse, frivole et accaparante.  Un dernier acte déroutant pour les sens.  Une sonate de houblons et de notes amères.  Une levure qui apporte ses plus beaux moments.  Une grande beauté sans doute capable de réécrire la définition du style.  Pour moi, tout simplement merveilleux.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

3267,"2011-02-26",3.3,"Pours a cloudy straw (dont know why amber was mentioned down below, never saw an amber triple yet). Huge white head that falls very quickly. No lacing left on glass.
Smells of spices and alcohol. Lot of alcohol in the nose. And the spice from a couple sniffs smells of anise. Almost like someone slipped some absinthe into my beer glass.
Little bit of the absinthe flavor up front, to include the alcohol content taste. A little peppery and maybe some coriander taste. When I first started drinking it it was mostly pepper I was tasting, now its the licorice/absinthe flavor finished off by the alcohol.
Coats the tongue with a slick oil like substance that seems to remind you that you just drank absinthe, except you didnt. And the alcohol kind of thins it out a bit. And its not that strong. Its not bad though, just strange.
Not horrible, but I definitely could only drink this one. Maybe if I didnt let it warm up over the course of 20 minutes it would have fared better. I might come back to this one again, but there are way too many beers to drink over here.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"

The aroma sports a nice and spicy yeast profile, notes of lemonpeel, grassy hops, and white pepper showing atop a malt base of sweet, doughy bread and honey sweetened grain.  Flavors follow suit, well balanced and certainly dried out with age, with the lightly sweet bread grain being countered with coriander, lemonpepper, green grass, and various light fruits.

3267,"2008-07-19",3.8,"Bright and golden like acacia honey, this brews lively carbonation exhales a fluffy long-lasting white head. Potently aromatic like many tripels, St Feuilliens take suggests the usual blend of sweet grains and classic overtones of bubble gum, soapy banana and pineapple esters. Unmistakable coconut shavings, biscuits, lemon peel and waxy honey present the certain idiosyncrasies of this beer. Deeper investigation yields hints of green mint, leather, cigar smoke and white grapes. An undeniably attractive though almost cloying aroma. Fluffy and ripe, the mouthfeel follows were the nose left off, starting sharp with citrus tones and quickly moving to spices and bubble gum. Ample grains carry a satisfying and balancing dryness as the finish leans towards a slightly herbaceous tone of basil and pepper. The alcohol isnt felt until a lingering heat warms the back of the tongue. Initially this seems to be a rather formulaic brew, but as the glass warms up the spice profile becomes especially intriguing, suggesting clove, black pepper and slightly musty peach flavor. St Feuillien has crafted a dynamic and enjoyable tripel that definitely ranks on the higher end of the style. (19/06/2007)","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

3267,"2008-03-19",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2014 330ml bottle (Cracked Kettle, Amsterdam) (6:4:8:4:16=3.8)
Slightly hazy gold, persistent creamy head. Aroma packed with dry and sharp hoppiness but caressed with a another delicious spicy tang, and banana hints, from the yeast. Soft but sharp palate - sharpness both from the pleasant carbonation and from immediately bitter hops. The yeasty taste accompanies the malt to provide notes which are almost liquoricey, and which waft peppery fumes up the nose. Alcohol aids that wafting, but doesnt impose itself. Powerful, but oh-so-subtle; complex and ever changing, ever developing. At risk of redundancy - great stuff, my kind of tripel, excellent! Well done!
Rerate: 330ml bottle (Koht, Tallinn) (7:4:8:4:15=3.7)
Lovely light aroma, light grains, sharp and uplifting. Alas near the bottom of the glass theres some alcohol too. Lovely hazy gold, persistent tight white head. Gloriously rereshing light palate. Gentle grains, and beautiful honey, so gentle, lovely and crisp and refreshing. Again this is what I like about belgian tripels. Understated, but delicious.

Spicy and yeasty aroma leading to the drier side of the spectrum of fresh Seville oranges, orange-peels, immature Kaiser pears, white pepper, grassy noble hops and all-spice with a sweet firm undertone of English marmalade too balance things out. Full, spicy, fruity and fresh flavour of orange-peels, fresh-baked white bread, white pepper and grassy herbal hops. Medium-bodied with a rather sparkling mouthfeel.

3267,"2008-03-10",4.1,"Not a pretender; instead a defender of the faith of textbook brewing consistency.  A great ""everyday"" Belgian Ale, exhibiting food-friendly, non-obtrusive flavors thanks to secondary bottle fermentation.  Yeast is present, yet not dominant, a great introductory Belgian to turn on the uninitiated.  Exceptional even-keeled mouthfeel as it cascades down the palate with conviction.

3267,"2007-07-13",2.5,"On tap at the Sharp Edge Bistro. I am very glad to have had the chance to taste this stuff. Pour is very similar to the appearance of ubiquitous pale yellow american lager. Perhaps a little hazy, but just barely. Constant micro bubbles rising within tho the initial palate is rather flat. Aroma is gentle sweet flowers with a hint of candy. Taste this and your mouth gets coated on the inside. There is a warm feeling all over. Very refined. The alky content is not readily apparent but it is there. There is an initial slight alky hit but that is immediately taken over by the sweet complexities of this brew. These hgih class brews really put the micro brews to shame. Comes across a little winelike, but civilized. Nice lacing. Never know this was a trippel, smooth and easy to drink. Each sip gives you a gentle love tap nudge on the shoulder that this is +8%. Then it goes away and hides. Finish again is winelike but the alky nudge is gone before you swallow.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

Raucous sweet malt aroma escapes the confines of the glass, a prelude to a nose of alcohol, candy sugar, generous malts and peppery fruits. Flavor is much the same, now hops are showing thier face, along with some tart caramel. Alcohol is very warm but not offensive, meshing quite well with the spiciness and sweetness. Palate was medium to full and the body seemed very well rounded and expressive for this style. Finishes on the dry side with a lingering white pepper component.

3267,"2006-05-23",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2009 In short: A tasty and crisp tripel with an intense dry noble hopping.  One of the best tripel out there.  Underrated.
How: Bottle 750ml/330 many times.  This re-write for a fresh (about 6 months) 750ml bottle.
The look: Partly cloudy golden body topped by medium white head leaving good lacing
In long: Nose is fruity, grassy and spicy.  A rather complex taste.  Main attractions are the fruity yeast (not focussing on any particular fruit), nice mix of spices (again with a lot more than just the usual coriander) and a whole lot of dry noble hops.  Just citrusy enough to give it a pleasant refreshing tartness.  Body feels full rich and crisp at the same time.  Finish is very sharp (almost aggressive) and dry.  With some age on it the finish becomes less sharp/dry and the fruity flavours take more room.  I prefer fresh.  9% abv very well hidden.  One of the best Tripel out there.  I buy these this beer in large quanitities.  Even bought a full 24 not so long ago.

Maybe I was expecting something else from this ale, thus I think my drinking was a bit biased with this one.  It was a tasty beverage, but I think it was a little too light for what I like.

Palate is lively with plenty of co2, medium bodied, lightly creamy, yet crisp.  Looks like a tripel, smells like a tripel, tastes like a tripel   I enjoyed this beer, yet did not fall in love as I was expecting.

3267,"2004-11-10",3.4,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2007 Bottle @ Belgian Beer Fest 11/04.  Knew I had to try this one, as Ive read all the good reviews and wanted to see for myself.  Pours a rather pale yellow, with light golds.  Small amount of haziness, with some deeper bright gold hues.  Small white head.  Aroma seems pretty straightforward, light citrus, almonds, light spicing and hopping.  Little yeast and alcohol presence.  Flavor is very unique.  Ah, so this is what sets this one apart.  Its like a trippel with tons of unusual spicing.  The spice erupts right away on the palate and then fades leaving you with a good yeasty, lightly malted trippel.  The palate being sufficiently dried out from the spice, the yeast is quite noticeable and the light honey-almond malt only sneaks in a bit.  Very unusual.  Perhaps a bit too much astringency.  I would like a bit more malt to back up the hops and spices.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Flavor somewhat bland but with some intense fruity gushes, and a sweet-and-sour complexity going down.

And, that taste? Divine! Utterly lovely, light, buouyant, with a dazzling hop prominence at first, and a good touch of graininess in the texture. Sweet, light, and scrumptious, and the sugar starts to take prominence here in the middle.

Then sitting at an antique table under a low spreading european oak with fine cheeses and a basket of fresh eggs in a straw ladden basket. Drab colors, flagstone and ivy.

Carbonation a little too lively for my taste, giving a slightly hard edge to an otherwise fairly smooth palate. Alcohol is smooth, only making a warming presence in the finish and on the swallow. Soft spicy flavours typical of a triple. Slight lingering hops and yeast leaving a pleasant bitterness in the mouth. Not a knock out beer, but certainly more than acceptable.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"
3267,"2004-01-31",4.5,"750 ml. brown Belgian bottle. Corked and caged. Lot number 130343. No freshness date seen. A loud ""POP"" releases the cork from the bottle, and also the genie within. Poured out a deep straw yellow, with a huge white, meringue-like head. It stuck around until the bottom of the glass, leaving a ridiculous lacing and a thick matting on top of the beer.
Aromas are of fresh cut hay, Belgian yeast, slight alcohols, lactic wheat tang, pineapples, fresh fruit, and slight hops notes as well.
Tastes are of fruits of every description, strong maltiness noted as well. The flavors dance on your tongue, tempting you to try just a little more. Thanks, I will.
Mouthfeel is rich and creamy, in part due to the high level of carbonation. Thick texture, slightly chewy even. Almost a meal in a glass.
Dangerously drinkable. Alcohol is well hidden, but warming upon impact in the stomach. I put away an entire 750 ml. bottle in one sitting, and I sat. And sat. And sat some more.
Great beer overall. Well worth the effort to seek it out.","","Cobra"

As beer warms the bitterness diminishes somewhat, greatly improving the overall experience.  Slightly sweet, candi sugar flavors.  Light body with a refreshing effect on the palate. Long spicy finish.   NOTE: I HAVE SEVERAL 750ml BOTTLES FOR TRADE IF INTERESTED.","Roanoke, Virginia, USA","beerstop"
3267,"2002-03-09",4.4,"The hoppiest triple Ive yet had. Piney, citrusy aroma and taste. The aroma also had substantial yeast and malt components, and was spectacular. Long spicy finish. The commercial description This beer has a white, smooth and very compact head is right on!","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
3267,"2002-02-10",4.2,"Delicious tripel. Firm head. Golden color. Spicy aroma and flavor. Resisting palate.","Bunnik/Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","caesar"
3267,"2002-01-03",4.6,"This is the kind of triple I like. Lively, complex, and not overly sweet. A true classic!","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
3267,"2001-12-25",4.1,"It has a beautiful head and a nice lace, the colour is cloudy blond. The aroma is fresh, pleasant and floral. It is complex, spicy, slightly tart, well-balanced. It has a long spicy aftertaste.","SWITZERLAND","Rutzicka"
3267,"2001-12-21",3.7,"Snow-white foam of fading consistancy over a limpid golden brew with lazy flight of bubbles looking like inverse snowfall.
Lively fruity and hoppy aroma, alas without ultimate complexity nor distinction.
Foams well in the mouth, refreshing, and leaving a dry hoppy taste, without particular intensity.  Long and slightly dry and bitter aftertaste.
Another quality beer from this excellent producer, in spite of which the penultimate Trappists are not quite reached.","Sterrebeek, BELGIUM","Belgik"
3267,"2001-07-02",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 25, 2005 light hazy blond colour, fine and firm head, apple and bready aroma, notes of honey, sweet and full-bodied, light bitterness, bready and fruity finish (orange zest) with some reidual sweetness - a beauty","Bienne, SWITZERLAND","Bov"
3267,"2001-02-21",5.0,"These beers deserve alot more credit than they get.  Another great beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","MonkeyProver99"
