1480,"2015-10-21",4.0,"On tap at Tumans in Chicago. I cant believe they gave me a whole pint of this stuff! Aroma is strong chocolate and malt. Flavor is a good balance of juicy slightly tart fruit, vanilla, and whisky barrel flavors. Barrel flavor isnt overwhelming as Traverse City Whisky is a fairly mild whisky and I dont think this beer was aged too long. I think thats a good thing though because I think a porter like this would easily overwhelmed and I like that you can still taste the base beer because it is a very good base beer.","Illinois, USA","drdisque"
1480,"2015-10-04",4.2,"Aroma is barrel, roasted malt, chocolate. Appearance is dark brown, light brown head. Taste is roasted malt, barrel, very nice. Mouthfeel is lovely, thick and nice carbonation. Overall, this is very very good.","Dearborn, Michigan, USA","ebone1988"
1480,"2015-10-03",4.3,"Draft - 9oz pour turned out to be a 16oz pour - whoops. Nose is vanilla, oak, bourbon, weed (some dude near me), and fuzzy memories of being at Dark Lord. Sip ads roast, booze, more wood, chocolate and lactose. Incredibly smooth and easy to drink. Danj-juh-russ. A treat considering this place just ran out of the mango habanero. Gums are going numb. Fantastic! Chewy. Whiskey dominates but the chocolate puts up a great fight. Great balance in the flavors. I see a rum barrel version imminently made.","Taylor Mill, Kentucky, USA","Chudwick"
1480,"2015-09-29",3.9,"Draft at Flannys during a Bells tap takeover. Pungent aroma of very sweet whiskey with a sharp fresh oak tone  that woodiness increases to the point of dominance. Minor grassy note with hints of dark cherries and prunes. Pours glossy black with a swiftly disappearing khaki head. What a lovely complex and balanced taste: sweet and boozy whiskey blends with vanilla, charred barley, bakers chocolate, a slightly overpowering dry cedar-oaky finish. Proper body for a porter. The wood characteristics are a bit overt but otherwise it is quite enjoyable.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
1480,"2015-09-12",4.2,"Draft to snifter at the Eccentric Cafe. Looks good; a slightly transparent dark cola with beige head that steadily dissipates into lacing. Smells great! Malty with notes of chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and oak alongside a nicely balanced mild to moderate cherry presence. Tastes like it smells, but not quite as rich and balanced, with a fairly smooth medium full-bodied mouthfeel thats slightly warming and pleasant for the abv. Smells better than it tastes, but great beer nonetheless.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
1480,"2015-09-12",4.2,"On tap: The aroma consists of moderate chocolate, vanilla, coconut, whiskey, and a touch of molasses. Its a dark brown with some faint orange highlights and a small beige head that fades to a thick ring. The flavor starts with moderate chocolate, caramel, and a touch if molasses. The finish has roasted malt, vanilla, coconut, and whiskey. Its medium-full bodied with mild carbonation and a somewhat oily mouthfeel.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
1480,"2015-09-12",4.4,"Tap at bells, what a fantastic beer, aroma is whiskey, chocolate, vanilla, and some sweet fruits. Taste is big whiskey, chocolate, vanilla, sweet fruits, and some subtle spices. World class

1480,"2015-09-09",4.1,"From notes. Enjoyed at the MGB Summer Beer Fest. Oh man, this was one I was looking forward to! The pour is a thinner looking dark brown with a thin film of khaki head that dissipates quickly. The aroma is really boozy. Behind that, its really good. There is a great oak and a strong vanilla carrying it. There is a light roast and some basic chocolate before the whiskey presents itself on the back end. The barrel really carries this, as youd imagine. The flavor is much of the same. There is a wonderful oak and vanilla. The chocolate and a light roast take a back seat, and the whiskey really comes through on the back end. The mouth feel is excellent. Its quite thick and viscous with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly chocolatey, roasty, boozy aftertaste.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
1480,"2015-09-01",4.1,"Draft. Poured black color with an average frothy brown head that mostly lasted with fair lacing. Moderate to heavy roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, wood, and dark alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. Medium to heavy roasted malt and alcohol flavor with a medium to heavy sweet smooth alcohol burn finish of moderate to long duration. This is a standout beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"

1480,"2015-08-09",4.4,"On tap a tMaduro pre 2015 GTMW event, one of the best beers we had all weekend and it was at our first stop! Pours a very dark brown almost black with a brown head and sticky lacing, the aroma is full of chocolate, roast and a good mixture of vanilla with a hint of whiskey, the flavor is full of vanilla and chocolate with the barrel showing in the finish, completely hides the abv, so good.","Quad Cities, Illinois, USA","cbfobes"
1480,"2015-08-08",4.1,"Draft to snifter pour opaque black with thin tan head. Nose sweet malt, light whiskey, some dark fruit and light roast. Nose is a little muted compared to the flavors. Taste super sweet, almost Karo syrup sweet, but nice. Some dark fruit and then hot chocolate. Barrel adds nice complexity instead of overpowering. More sweet and light roast in the finish.","Loveland, Ohio, USA","drsordr"

1480,"2015-06-24",4.2,"Live Rate,
Deal w/ it


Pours basically black with a small but well retained head & some decent lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is loads of dark fruit & bourbon. Its got a nice bit of chocolate & roast with a noticeable enough booziness.

The flavor is pleasantly sweet with a nice coconut,
dark chocolate & roasty bitterness for balance. There is a great vanilla & bourbon element to it thats not totally overbearing. 

The mouthfeel is huge & palate coating but the bitterness lends a nice zippiness that works well in tandem with the thickness of it all.
 Gracious this is fantastic.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
1480,"2015-06-16",4.6,"On tap at Eccentric. Dark brown body with incredible aromas of vanilla, chocolate and a whiff of whiskey. The whiskey presence is muted enough (in the nose and on the palate) to make this one about the complexity of the wonderful milk chocolate and vanilla of the base beer. This is one that should be bottled and sent directly to my house!!!","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"
