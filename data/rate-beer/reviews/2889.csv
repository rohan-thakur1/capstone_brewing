2889,"2017-04-29",3.8,"Dark amber pour with perhaps some reddish tint. Cloudy with a quick, bubbly white foam. Rich, vinegary nose with some earthy yeast (brett) notes around the edges. Earthy, vinous flavors in the middle pick up some (rather muted) malt. The spices, green apple notes and citrus bitterness gives the flavors depth. The flavor is tart, but not as tart as the nose. Medium to light body with restrained fizz. The finish is not as dry as the nose might suggest. The pinot noir barrels give it an earthy depth that takes it to the (relatively) less dry end of the saison spectrum. The 8% ABV makes it more of a super saison and matches the complexity of the flavors. (Batch 24 December 2015)","Pennsylvania, USA","PanMarek"
2889,"2017-04-23",3.9,"Purchased in Montpelier, Vermont. Pours a cleaner golden colour with beautiful carbonation. Gets hazier at every pour. White creamy head, very good retention and some nice lacing. Earthy funky aromas from the Bretts. The yeast shows up with time, adding some balance of sweetness. Hints of roses and cherries. The taste is surprisingly bitter. Was not excepting this for a Saison, but here it is. Some of the orange notes lingers. Some much going on, hard to get the oak barrels used in this one. The nose gets a little more bitter as the beer gets completely cloudy. Quite a unique Saison which is nice to share and sip.","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"

2889,"2016-12-12",4.6,"Love Buzz is the kind of funky beauty IÂ’ve come to expect from Anchorage. It pours light amber - the subtle reddish tint evidently comes from the rose petals used in this brew. Floral, woodsy, vinous, and yeasty aromas. Flavor is deeply complex with bready and earthy yeast, rose, wine tannins, spices, a slight cheesiness, and zesty fruit. Moderately lively feel and quite a bit of bitterness (redolent of fruit pith) for a Saison. The musty elements will be difficult for the uninitiated, but if you believe that rot can be gorgeous, this will exceed your expectations.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Flavor has peppery saison yeast, mild tang of mandarin orange, and a background woodsy vinous element. Body is medium, fuller than most Saisons, probably due to Alcohol and barrel aging.

2889,"2016-02-05",4.1,"Bottle, shared by me... in my dining room... just now.
On all accounts this is an old bottle. I had to dig through Facebook to see the picture of the bottle lineup from when I first got this. I donÂ’t know why itÂ’s taken me so long to open it, but the picture was from April of 2013, which puts this at three years old... maybe a touch younger. 
IÂ’ve had the beer since then, and itÂ’s a beer I like, but this rating is going off this dust bottle from my basement. 

Pours a bright orange with a huge head and nice lacing on the glass.

Goodness this smells good, lime zest, dusty attic & wet limestone basement... very nicely funky and earthy with some barnyard stuff... but impossibly bright for the age. 

The flavor is dry and tart... itÂ’s got a really nice depth of rich wine like oak and fruit character. There is some lemon zest, there is some light citrus peel bitterness... there is a little bit of apple... zippy and bright, wow. 

The palate is remarkably lively & sharp.

I was really pleased to find this. IÂ’m a substantial Anchorage fan, and a huge saison enthusiast. LetÂ’s just say it doesnÂ’t disappoint. Murky yellow-brown pour with rich orange highlighting. The nose is that distinctively Anchorage thing in which the garlic/onion/tropical fruit of new school hops merge into something that totally transcends my usual garlic sensitivity and comes of as absolutely enticing, white grapefruit and lemon and maybe a bit of pepper. The flavor is gently tart, not at all a sour ale but rather the tart style of saison, recalling Jolly Pumpkin at its best but more subtle, lemon and blood orange atop pepper and prominent (but never overdone) pinot grapes, layered with a well-integrated perfume that never comes of as gimmick or additive but rather emanates from the core of the beer. ItÂ’s beautiful. I donÂ’t usually spend 15-16 dollars per bottle these days, but this is one of the rare few not only worth trying at that price point, but worth revisiting as soon as possible. IÂ’ll be on the look out.

This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a ruddy orange to brown color with a one finger white foamy head that dissipated within about less than a minute. Semi-thick but lightly coating the sides of the glass is an ample amount of lacing.
The smell was quite floral with a bitter to sour lemon to orange aroma that was quite invasive.
The taste was bitter, tart and sour and semi - dry and vinous all around.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a decent sessionability about it. For a saison, the carbonation seemed appropriate for the style. Despite having a semi-floral aftertaste, the finish is so dry - wow, its dry.

I knew right away I liked it but I just have to keep inhaling away to try and figure out what I smell. This beer sets the standard for complex aromas. Its sort of perfume, candy, a touch of brett hiding in the back, slightly earthy, slight touch of alcohol. After reading the bottle it came to me. ItÂ’s the rose hips.

2889,"2013-07-17",4.2,"Batch 1
Aroma has huge amounts of pineapple, but also some light pepper, coriander and clove phenolics. There is also a bit of a spicy floral aroma. Light fruity esters along with low oak notes. 
Pours a cloudy, dark golden orange with a big, faintly off white, pillowy head with moderate retention. Lacing is moderate and legs small. 
Flavor has a hint of sweet malt left to it, but it is otherwise Brett, phenolics and oak. The pineapple is in the flavor but not as dominant as the aroma. Nice phenolic notes with pepper, clove and an herbal, floral note. You can taste the high mineral content of the water which accentuates the moderate bitterness. Lingering spice in the finish. The finish also has a real floral quality to it. Only light oak and tannins present as the flavor is dominated by phenolics and a floral note. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low acidic astringency with medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall a very nice beer but the time has taken away some of the character that I am sure was present like the orange peel. The grapefruit has really come out though in the aroma as this beer develops more Brett character. Not as much wine influence as I would have expected.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Aroma of grapefruit and orange citrus, bretty funk, oak, wine, plenty of strong florals, spices, and sweet malts. The flavor starts and finishes with abundant floral notes, with grapefruit, oak, bretty funk, stone fruit, spices, and some sweet and bready malts. But the florals and grapefruit dominate here. Long, lingering bitterness from those two. Medium-bodied, with medium carbonation.

The finish is clean and pleasantly tart.  This is somewhere between a saison and a sour.  One of the best examples of barrel aging I have tried.

2889,"2012-10-29",3.6,"Batch #1, August 2011; Sampled October 2012
A steady pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a four-finger thick, pale tan colored head; it leaves lots of thick lacing clumped to the sides of my glass as it falls with lots of craggy nooks and structures. The beer is a murky, amber hue that shows a light hazed, pale amber hue when held up to the light. The aroma is lightly tart, definitively funky, phenolic, slightly medicinal, and it has a solid, grassy and cracker like malt character in the finish. This has a lightly herbal hoppiness to it that plays a supporting role in the nose. There are notes of musty white pepper notes, lots of spicy floral notes.

My first sip is dry tasting, a bit effervescent, slightly tart, with a cracker like malty finish and lots of general spiciness. There seems to be a bit of firm, astringent, spicy oak and a rounded woody flavor that pervades throughout the flavor profile. Spicy floral notes are a mix of pepper, carnation, nasturtium petals, and a touch of clove. A firm, musty, musky, phenolic Brettanomyces note perfumes this beer, though it is still smooth enough that it doesnÂ’t dominate the flavor profile here. A soft citrus character starts to come out as the beer warms and provides notes of Meyer lemon zest, a touch of tangerine zest, and maybe some tropical fruit like notes that just peak through in the finish. Nice and light bodied like a good Saison should be, in fact it is even on the light side for a Saison of this strength; making for a dangerously quaffable brew.

Not bad, but not as good as I was hoping either; I wonder if a fresher sample would be more to my liking. Still this is a more than serviceable Saison & I still want to try everything by this brewer that I can.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2889,"2012-10-03",4.2,"Sour aromas of tart red fruit, apple cider vinegar, citrus, herbs, must, old charred wood, and mild cheese, first awaken your senses. In the mouth, the beer has a tart, refreshing quality that makes your mouth salivate.. Definitely some sourness and Brett influence going on, without losing the core Belgium yeast quality. Complex layers of florals, spices, yeast, citrus and tart red fruit, linger on the palate. Definitely a touch on the funky/earthy side overall. A dry finish of herbs and savory nuances leaves a slightly bitter impression each sip. I can see how some might compare this to wine, though it tends to remind me more of apple vinegar mixed with herbs, citrus and flowers, creating a a complex beverage, that is hard to define. Definitely a geek beer, I can't say this beer is for everyone. You must enjoy sour beers to even begin to appreciate this.

2889,"2012-06-18",3.3,"Hmmm... my bottle must have had something a bit off.  Heard nothing but good about this and it is nice but there is some odd, medicinal, almost metallic thing going on.  Plenty of oak and brett, pinot is present but behind the scenes.  Maybe the brett just went too wild in this bottle, i dunno, it doesnÂ’t really taste like a brett bomb.  Palate is lively and finishes dry- almost everything about this beer is right except i just canÂ’t get past that almost chemical weirdness.  Ended up blending it with a bottle of Allagash Interlude, which worked well.  Muted the medicine and perked up the Interlude, which was a bit too still after 3+ years.  Still not a bad beer at all, even with that odd flavor mixing in.","Missouri, USA","mbsmith"
2889,"2012-06-15",4.4,"A - Orange rust color with a decent head that lasted the hole way and left lovely lacing all the way down the glass.
S - BRETT!!! but not all brett, lots of sour funk reminiscent of a light gueuze, Floural hints all over the place and orange oil. It is fantastic
T - More brett than anything else but not to say there is not a small floural hint with orange zest and funk in the backround. A decent ammount of Earth in the back-end lending it to classic Saison flavors. NOT as wonderful as the aroma but that just means great as opposed to AMAZING!
M - light bodied with soft but effervescent carbonation. A bit harsh to begin with but mellows quickly.

How: Bottle 750ml, a few times.  This bottle consumed 4 months after bottling, bought in a store and also received from TURDFERGUSON
The look: Cloudy amber body topped by a large off-white head with good retention
In long: Nose is bursting with musty brett over fresh apricots and freshly cut oak.  For the wild beer lover this aroma is borderline hypnotizing.  Taste is very wild/bretty with horse blanket and kind of other stuff synonymous with rustic-wild.  A smooth body with soggy bready malts and soft cookies.  Fresh apricots, some white grapes, fresh pineapples, fresh pine-tree, garden flowers.  There is a very mild sourness, a moderate tannins presence and a medium piney/fruity bitterness with resinous undertones.  But mostly the beer is just crazy wild.  Wicked beer.

2889,"2012-02-20",4.2,"750ml bottle.  Fruity, sweet and lightly winey aroma, some red grape, yeast funk, horseblanket, must and straw, with lighter touches of berry, oak, faintly peppery spice, light sweetness and some herbal, green, floral notes.  Lots going on here to start, for sure.  Cloudy orange in color with a foamy, sticky, uneven head and voluminous lacing.  Flavor is surprisingly sweet and fruity, only lightly funked out and Bretty, more berryish and stone fruit character throughout, faint Pinot touches, vanilla, oak and earthiness late, certainly not much in the way of bitterness to speak of although there is a very faint tartness late.  Gently bubbly mouthfeel, perhaps a bit of a syrupy feel, body is medium-full.   Very unusual and very nice.  While this was certainly enjoyable, it was a pretty recent bottling, and if I had two of them, I would be very interested to see what impact a year or so of cellar aging would have -- it seems fairly obvious that the existing sweetness may be meant to simply feed the Brett and provide some dryness and more prominent farminess, while still allowing for some residual sweetness to provide the framework.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"

Aroma: The nose has some floral notes, citrus, herbs, spice, brett yeast, oak, and some red wine

This is another great brew from Anchorage.  It has a wonderful complexity to it.  This is a really interesting offering, and you can really feel all of the different components that went into this one.

The taste is similar tot he nose, with the Brett present, nicely accenting the citrus grapefruit hop notes, and the earthy toasted malt which carries some sweetness that was not noticeable in the nose.

2889,"2011-12-07",4.2,"Bottle.  Pours a rusty brown color with a thick lasting head on top.  Some decent lacing sticks to the sides of the glass the whole way through.  The aroma, surprisingly, is somewhat reminiscent of the Bitter Monk Belgian I had not too long ago from these guys.  Lots of french oak and wine character.  IÂ’m picking up a lot of white grape though, not unlike a scent found in something aged in chardonnay.  Citrus peel, flowers, lavender, and funky ""wild"" yeast join in to a really nice scent.  Smells a touch more hoppy too than expected but IÂ’ve got no issue with that.  The flavors are lightly spiced with lavender and chamomile.  Again, thereÂ’s lots of oak and wine here.  Pinot Noir is red, right?  For some reason this smells and tastes like itÂ’s been aged in white wine.  ThatÂ’s not a bad thing, just an observation.  I actually think more of a more berry flavor wouldnÂ’t work as well in this.  The finish shows bitter citrus hops with some notes of resin too.  The 8% doesnÂ’t completely hide but this is very drinkable and doesnÂ’t have any of that overly sweet, tangy, and alcoholic flavors often found in higher abv Saisons.  ItÂ’s an interesting take on a Saison but is complex, drinkable, and very tasty.  I would have never guessed this beforehand but I like the Bitter Monk more than this.  Regardless, this is a great beer and I am really impressed by this new brewery.  I canÂ’t wait to try their next offerings!","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

2889,"2011-12-05",3.8,"Bottle.

Head is initially large, frothy, rocky, white, fully lasting.
Body is hazy light amber, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is moderately malty (toasted grain), moderately hoppy (resin, grapefruit), lightly to moderately yeasty (cobwebs, barnyard), with notes of alcohol, menthol, gum, lemon zest, oak, sour apple, band-aid, pepper.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately acidic, moderately to heavily bitter.

Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

A difficult beer to rate, since itÂ’s not really a saison (too big and boozy), and IÂ’m also not fond of raw/green hop odor.  But then again it doesnÂ’t fail the style in the other usual ways, so itÂ’s not too hard to mostly forgive its New World aggressiveness.  Think of this more like an Americanized tripel, but one thatÂ’s dry and yeasty like it should be, not syrupy sweet and banana-heavy like most American examples.  A ""super saison"" if you prefer, but IÂ’ve never liked that term for the same reason ""Imperial mild"" is silly.  Credit to the aroma for sure, itÂ’s complex and rustic...wild, woody, and quite enjoyable other than the crude hop stink (the aroma could easily score a nine if only the hops were less brutish).  I would have guessed white wine barrels, though...I get absolutely none of the usual pinot noir fruit character like strawberry, raspberry, cranberry, etc.  And thankfully the added spices are difficult to pick out, even though thereÂ’s a vague sense that itÂ’s not adjunct-free.  Very dry in the mouth despite having plenty of starting sweetness...itÂ’s big, but at least the finish is clean and bitter.  Very noticeable alcohol burn, but not out of the norm for being 8%.  Overall I like it quite well as a Belgian-styled strong ale, but I am naturally disappointed that it isnÂ’t a saison. Also, the fact that this is $16 means I will never buy another bottle (Saison Dupont is almost half that, as one example...I realize this is barrel aged, but would I rather drink Dupont regardless of price? definitely).  ItÂ’s obvious the brewer has it in him to make a decent straight-up saison, though, and I hope he does so one day (and prices it more properly).","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

I could imagine this beer being equally tasty in a different, less earthy and funky way without the B. brux, and possibly more quaffable, but itÂ’s great as is. Passion fruit and complex citrus notes emerge with greater presence as it warms. All the intermingling flavours and aromas are delicately balanced, yet the overall network of zesty citrus, peppercorn, funk, oak and saison yeast filth is one of tremendous intensity. The finish is slightly astringent, though this is characteristic of the blend of stains employed and only adds to the dryness of the finish, making the beer effectively more quenching and sessionable (if only I could afford this as an everyday session ale *sigh*). The mouthfeel is velvety, even moreso as it warms, with lively carbonation and a long duration. If only all things to come from Alaska were this awesome.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Drink4Satan"

2889,"2011-11-21",4.1,"750ml big thanks to pintplease.
Appearance : Hazy pale amber with big foamy and creamy head. Lots of lacing.

Aroma : Big brett with nice spices and wood. Very nice fruity notes. Light citrusy and light leathery notes. Nice herbal hops.

Palate : Carbonation is very soft. A little bit too soft for me especially near the end of the glass.

Taste : Lots of brett with spices. Big fruity brett on finish with leather and wood. Barnyard. Very fruity, nice hops. Nice herbal notes. Light tropical fruits. Finish is a bit sticky and resinous.

Overall : Wow what an elegant beer. Very complex, very nicely balanced. Awesome brett profile with great hops. Very cohesive, nothing is overpowering. Very dry and rather drinkable at first. At the end it got a bit too much with the hops and the big brett. I think the lack of carbonation made it a bit cloying after half the bottle (we were two on it). Still an amazing beer. Really complex, really well made. IÂ’m impressed.","QuÃ©bec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"
2889,"2011-11-18",3.8,"Bottle. Moderate aromas all around, with malt notes of grain and straw, flowers for the hops, barnyard and musty for the yeast, and background notes of grape, wood, berry and a huge mix of spices like allspice, cardamom, mace and cinnamon. Head is huge, creamy turing rocky, mostly white with excellent lacing and is mostly lasting. Color is hazy yet sparkling amber. Flavor starts lightly sweet and lightly to moderately acidic, then finishes lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter and sour. Palate is on the lighter side of medium, slippery, with a lively carbonation and has a lightly astringent finish. Great aromas and great balance in this Saison, and the barrrel aging is very noticable.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"

2889,"2011-11-09",4.0,"Bottle.  Starts with a gorgeous pour...hazed dirty orange color with thick, dense, and quite lacy cream colored head.  Nose is quite nice as well...really get the pinot barrel influence coming through here..grapey and a bit earthy over some saison/belgiany yeast tones.  Flavors bring forth a lot of the pinot grapey/oaky nuances and combine them with a nice, spicy yeast character and a relaxingly crisp saison-esque, spritzy body.  Remarkably light and refreshing for something boasting 8% alcohol. Whatever spices were used certainly do not come forth very strong or overpowering, which in my opinion, is a great thing.  The brett is subtle but you can tell itÂ’s really helping bringing out that oaky vinous quality.  IÂ’ve heard all the hype of these guys and to be honest, iÂ’m starting to recognize that itÂ’s well deserved.  These guys are definitely a solid addition to the craft beer world.  Nicely done....canÂ’t wait to try more from them.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
2889,"2011-11-09",4.3,"My Bottom Line :  
This bountiful Wild SaisonÂ’s floral intricacies lean into tropical fruitiness and pine-y brettanomyces, while oak tannins tag along the enjoyable dryness. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A sheet of foam crowns the misty pale amber.
-This rivals some of Jolly PumpkinÂ’s best efforts, execution-wise, for a Wild Ale.
-Effervescence could have been higher for such a brew. Although that would have made it dangerously easy to forget about the alcohol touch.
-The flavor profile is highly cohesive even with all the variables in play. Great complexity and harmony.
-The resinous hop bitterness is well levelled with the rest of the brewÂ’s moderately high intensity.
-I canÂ’t really perceive the Pinot Noir signature in here, but the oaken sagacity is perceivable.

2889,"2011-11-09",2.9,"750ml bottle purchased at The Davis Beer Shoppe.  Wow, the aroma on this is really buggy with tart hints of brett and likely some pedio, too.  Some sour green apple hints, and maybe some light oakiness in the nose.  Underneath all of this, there is a stale urine character, which is a bit off-putting.  Mostly opaque honey-colored body with a large, off-yellow head that leaves decent lacing behind.  Starts pretty harsh and tart, with some bitter olive juice characteristics.  The softens just a little bit towards the middle, and a scant amount of spiciness presents itself along with some yeast esters.  Finishes bitter and dry.  Imagine eating a mouthful of cheap pimento olives that are just a little sour, and you have this beer.  Not sure why this is considered a saison on this site, when itÂ’s clearly a wild ale with saison as a base beer.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

2889,"2011-10-31",4.0,"Batch 1, August 2011. 

Pours a completely opaque, dark golden orange color with a frothy, pillowy 2.5 finger white head that has very good retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap. Streaks and splotches of soapy lacing left behind. 

Earthy, slightly funky aroma with lots of barn/farmhouse character along with some prominent brett and zesty spice. ThereÂ’s also some sweet fruit notes but the barrel presence is subtle. Musty bretty funk compliments the saison yeast nicely. Hints of eatery fruits and bready yeast along with some pepper and coriander. IÂ’m picking up a vinous presence that compliments the eatery fruit presence. Subtle earthy oak with hints of cherry, strawberries, grape and other dark fruit. Very complex nose but could use a bit more barrel in the nose. 

Medium bodied but on the fuller end with a slight creamy texture that is countered by the funky/sour character. Lots of musty funk/dry brett flavor that melds with the saison/farmhouse yeast pretty well. Slightly puckering but more dry and funky than tart. Much more so than I expected resulting in a dryness that is exaggerated by the berrel notes. Dry toasted oak with a faint vinous red wine character that gives off hints of grape, strawberry and other dark fruits. Pretty complex but the funk/brett donates slightly overpowering the eatery fruit notes and Pinot noir elements. Pretty good with a well masked ABV but could use bit more balance. IÂ’m glad I got to try this one and am looking forward to sampling more from this brewery.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
2889,"2011-10-31",3.6,"Bottle; Pour is murky golden with an above average off white head in this glass - retention rate is average I suppose - with some light lacing present as well. This is an interesting brew - but IÂ’ll be frank - I was expecting more. The nose is spicy / peppery, with an earthy character from the oak - while providing some saison notes of lemongrass and mild belgian yeast. The flavor profile has more of the fruity citrus notes - leading into heavy spices and oak, while a certain sweetness comes into play that I didnÂ’t pull from the nose. The brett did honestly hit me fairly heavily out of the gate, but I felt like I adjusted to it fairly well going forward. This one finishes quite dry - so I suppose there is a lot of elements here; the brett being the big one - yet it doesnÂ’t feel quite balanced - by my estimation.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

2889,"2011-10-27",4.0,"750ml bottle.  Pours a hazy, dusky, deep burnt orange amber color with a thick, stubborn head of spongy, beige tinted froth.  Slowly, the foam settles to a thin, swirly film with a pronounced edge.  Thick, hard, sticky cobweb lacing coats  early the wntire glass.  After warming up a bit, gorgeous aromas of dusty, peppery, earthen brett and dried pineapple flesh are met with old oak and mild red grape tannins.  Hints of tart cherry skin emerge from the Pinot-soaked depths.  Bready, caramelized Malta are honey-kissed but well attenuated, providing an ample, softly biscuity backdrop for the zesty, floral Belgian yeast and earthy brett.  The more it warms, the more vinous it becomes.  At times it reminds me of SupplicationÂ’s big, bretty, much less sour cousin.  The flavor tows a similar line, earthy as hell and very spicy and peppery.  I detect hints of rose hips and hibiscus flower in the prominent yeast profile.  Malts are dry, toasted, and crackery, hinting also at very well attenuated biscuit.  A grassy-floral hop bite is more prominent than the nose suggests.  Vinous character is toned down, as is the oak, in comparison with the nose.  The palate is weighty, yet dry, enlivened by zippy, almost stinging carbonation.  Bitter botanicals and floral hops intensify greatly on the finish, lingering well after the swallow.  Overall, itÂ’s a damn fine beer.  IÂ’d like to see things toned down a bit almost across the board (alcohol, brett, spice, hops), which would make it a bit more palatable and allow the Pinot Noir flavors to shine a bit more.  IÂ’m splitting hairs now, of course.  Great brew.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Tastesnof tart cherries, Pinot noir aging comes thriught, pepper, grass, and floral notes. Lively carbonation and quick drying on palate although flavor lingers.  Reall really good.","New York, USA","Jow"
2889,"2011-09-26",4.6,"750 c&c from The Davis Beer Shoppe in Davis, CA. This place has lots of good beer!!! Pours hazy dark amber with a frothy/foamy off-white head. Aroma through the foam is celery and very mucky barnyard. Followed by fruity perfume? Med + body. Flavor is celery, barnyard, red wine, funk, barnyard, yeast/spice, oak, French shoes(:)) This is fruity, juicy funky stuff. This is rich vinosity hitting farm yard. My mouth tingles. My nose rejoices. Where do these guys come from?","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
2889,"2011-09-25",3.8,"750ml bottle, purchased at Pangaea in Sacramento. Pours a murky, dark orange-brown color; fine-bubbled light-tan head with solid retention and lacing. Lots of red berries, vanilla, light citrus notes, and a mild brettiness; lightly funky and fruity and creamy. Medium body; medium-high carbonation; light red wine notes, creamy texture, a modestly developed brett character thatÂ’s more lime and crackery than overt tartness; nice heavily berry character with very light tannins, almonds, a touch coarse but damn tasty. Medium finish: bretty, crackery, some lasting berry notes.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
2889,"2011-09-23",4.3,"Bottle (Batch #1, August 2011). Pours with a hazy, deepish gold body with a large and lasting, fluffy off-white head. Great lace. Aromas amazingly good! Right off the bat: fresh tangerine/grapefruit juice. Good acidity, a little funk, red wine, tropical fruit hop notes, CITRA! Smells a little bit like Le Terroir with the hop and funk note. Sweet, perfume, floral, estery. Light bready malt. Very fragrant, pineapple. Amazing! Flavors are funky as well, juicy, oak, barrel, red wine, fruit,  floral, a bit grassy. A touch grainy, bready and straw like. Surprisingly bitter (both hop and tannin). Nice tropical fruit, grassy hop notes, some pepper, rich yet delicate, lots of nice tropical brett C esters. Lingering, slightly acidic stonefruit. Blown away, this is OUTSTANDING! Lively, playful carbonation, lingering funk, nice tannin, lightly warming, creamy bubbles. Balanced and complex.

This might be one of my new favorite breweries.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
2889,"2011-09-16",4.1,"Pour amber with a light reddish/orange hue and a good sized off-white pillowy head.  The aroma has lots of peach, tartness, peppery spice, floral powderiness, hints of pinot noir and earthy saison yeast. Very pleasant aroma.  Medium / light crisp body thatÂ’s a bit rough with lightly sharp carbonation.  Starts with much more of the pinot noir barrel aging right off the bat.  All of the aroma traits are there with a earthy/woody abrasiveness that works great for the beer.  The finish is very dry and flowery with lots of barrel notes and a lasting crisp peppercorn flavor sticking to the tongue.  Another great beer from Anchorage.  They are two for two now & canÂ’t wait to see whatÂ’s next.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
2889,"2011-09-03",3.9,"Bottle shared at The BeerMongers...  Poured golden with a white-ish head.  Pinot wine-like oak and Brett on the nose.  Spices really shined in the initial flavors with the peppercorns being most notable. Some vinous wine-like characters and musky Brett yeast and esters. A little bit of bitter rind and citrus characters too.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"
