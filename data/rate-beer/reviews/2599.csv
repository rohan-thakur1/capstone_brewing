Dark mahogany with modest, tan head / Rich nose of roast coffee and chocolate / Light to medium body, moderately tart with just a hint of sugar, and excellent balance and dry finish / Deep flavors of bittersweet chocolate, dark roast coffee, and hazelnuts, with notes of oatmeal and caramel / An elegant, chocolately, sour; but, not really fair to compare this to a Belgian sour since this is not made with brettanomyces.  Spoke to the brewer and he thought this beer would be better classified as a ""traditional ale"", and I agree although, appreciated on its own merits, its a pretty fine sour.  Would love to see more of this style.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jstraw"

2599,"2012-05-26",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 28, 2012 Sampler, guest tap @ the GI Clyborn location.  Color is dark brown.  Moldy cobwebby aroma with faint cherry pit and some roast.  It is akin to a Flanders but even tamer and the roast is novel (light roast).  Flavor has more sour cherry flavor covered in roast. Interesting and very quaffable. Would love to buy this in a 10 dollar sixer. But roast and sour a bit weird.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Brewed by Against the Grain, I knew this would not let me down after a trip
on the train to Local Option for an evening nightcap. Despite a price tag that
was a bit high I enjoyed this solid, sessionable beer with plenty of unique
character. Hopefully more regional breweries try their hand at this somewhat
different style.

Aroma / Appearance - The deep black body rolled around like
waves on a choppy sea. Fluid and soft the nose is standard for the style.
Sour coffee, malt, and rye drive a profile which is right on par with
expectations. My first thought is a Snickers bar dipped in espresso grounds.

Flavor / Palate - Gentle and soft, the mouthfeel is not as
intense as expected. A mix of coffee, plums, and sour mash play against each
in a competition to see which can last the longest. Eventually it transitions
to a burnt chocolately finish with a tart bite. Just thinking about this makes
me want to seek out another pint.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
2599,"2012-05-19",3.5,"Pours a very deep brown, almost black, with a tan head.  Aroma is sour, consisting of apple, cherry, and lemon.  Sour taste continues, without the first fruit aroma impressions.  What really remains is the sour apple, of course.  Very sour, bitter aftertaste.  I love this style, but it is not among my favorites for the fact that I believe this is a bit more watery than others.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"
2599,"2012-05-19",3.5,"Draft on tap at Local Option Salad Days event (Chicago, IL). Quick stop in to rate this bad boy too. Pours a rich deeper brown hue, firm haze in the body, some touches of brownish amber glow on the bottom and edges. A cakey beige head sticks around, laces ok. Sticks around well, pretty. Aromas are some stark gentle wild yeast elements, gentle brett, lacto, and some dry toasty malts. Mellow red fruit, more biscuit, gentle yogurt and cobwebs. A bit vague. Initial is lighter end of medium bodied offering some gentle dark fruit, touches of tartness, cherry, some mellow toast, biscuits, dry elements. Gentle bretty funk and dryness, darker biscuity malts. Middle shows a more impressive cherry element, lacto sharp tartness, mellow dryness, touches of biscuit, toast, and bready malts. The cherry kinda comes into its own in the middle. Backend offers yogurt, dryness, touches of prickly tartness, yeasty elements. A gentle carbonation, some toast and biscuits, grainy malts, and touches of earth. Mellow wild yeast beer. Solid.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2599,"2012-05-10",3.7,"Enjoyed on tap at the Local option, with the brewers, the owner.  Several samples of a Flanders Red I realize there really isnt any cherry here, and my palate can walk out scott-free. Coffee! aroma, brown colour, lacey, creamy. I am told only 2 brewers in the USA do this, and I am told from my fellow raters, that someone tried it at a one off cask fest in Ontario.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"

Murky dark brown with light tab head. Aromas of chocolate, plum, light funk, and a bit of a metallic note. Flavors of chocolate, light toast, some bread, plum, cherry, dark fruits, and nice tartness. Mouthfeel is a little soft, but overall I thought this worked.","Mount Prospect, Illinois, USA","msante79"
2599,"2012-04-27",3.7,"On tap at fountainhead. Interesting blackish brown thin fan head. Nose is dark fruits, roasted malts, cherry cola. Interesting grape soda carbonation and sourness with mild chocolate notes. Complex to say the least and I think it works.
