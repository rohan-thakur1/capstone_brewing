2552,"2017-04-14",1.1,"Comment un brasseur comme Brewdog peut-il se compromettre dans une bière sans alcool ???
Deux explications : le business .. ou la science-fiction, sur la planète ""nanny state"".
En loccurrence, on sest quand même cassé le cul chez Brewdog pour mettre 5 houblons dans 0,5 % abv  il faut être fort !! Nous sommes donc avec une ""alcohol free hoppy ale"", houblonnée en amarillo, centennial, columbus, cascade, simcoe, plus un dry hopping en amarillo et centennial ..
Excusez du peu et de linconséquence ... Niveau ebu de 45.
Mon exemplaire était à 8 mois avant date, tout frais, avec son étiquette vert émeraude.
Couleur candi brun, caramel foncé, à la clarté nette.
Bulles très grosses, sur les parois.
Mousse beige clair, soyeuse, stable à 3 mm.
Arômes de houblon américain, pamplemousse, lichee, pointe de griotte, fruit de la passion, pointe
deau de rose.
1ère bouche très effacée, triste, où les impressions du nez seffacent comme une étoile filante.
Texture aqueuse.
Arrière-bouche courte, mais qui laisse un peu damertume de parade.
2ème où on passe sur une petite citronnade, avec limpression dune radler.
Arrière-bouche qui séteint sans autre formalité.
La longueur améliore un rien lamertume, mais sans aucun accompagnement fruité.
Jambes à flocons moyens, collantes aux parois.
Alcool : tiens, si je vous dis quil est inefficient, vous ne me croirez pas !!
Finale entre amertume et panaché. 
CONCLUSION : il est dabord bien triste de voir ce genre de réalisation chez un bon brasseur,
il est ensuite inconcevable dans gaspiller dans un tel cadre de lamarillo !!
Moi qui suit contre ce gaspillage, jai été servi un maximum ..

2552,"2017-03-20",0.8,"La curiosité peut nous amener à faire des choses étranges....comme pousser un amateur de bière à tester une bière sans alcool (ou quasiment sans alcool). Mais il faut dire que laffiche était alléchante : un brasseur de renom : Brewdog, plusieurs houblons dans la recette : Centennial, Amarillo Columbus, Cascade et Simcoe et utilisation de Dry Hopping en Centennial et Amarillo. En verre, le bel ambré couleur merisier, dune parfaite limpidité (EBC aux environs de 32) est encourageant. Leffervescence, pas très poussée et sur des bulles de gros diamètres donne naissance à une mousse se stabilisant à 5 minimètres dépaisseur : tout à fait honorable. Le nez surprend alors;, dune symphonie aromatique de toute beauté donnant beaucoup despoirs. Fruits exotiques, pamplemousse, litchi, griottes et rose sassemblent dans une parfaite harmonie. On ne peut alors que se presser den arriver à la première gorgée devant tant de promesses....Et plus importante est alors la déception pour une dégustation plate, quasiment sans saveur. Lattaque est aqueuse sur de très faibles notes de litchi et de fruits exotiques. Seul larrière bouche arrive à sauver du naufrage présentant une touche légèrement amère houblonnée. La deuxième bouche nous enfonce un peu plus. Celle-ci perd encore du volume (et oui, cela est possible) sur des arômes insipides. La troisième bouche présente heureusement une légère amertume. Celle ci est cependant sans arôme, sur une ligne purement amère. LIBU présentée à 45 laisse perplexe, le ressenti étant bien moindre (provenant très certainement de labsence darômes). De façon surprenante cependant, la sensation damertume augmente très légèrement au cours de la dégustation (jai bien indiqué très légèrement!). Le sucre est quant à lui peu présent et aurait finalement peut être gagné à être poussé. Nous en arrivons donc au final, court, avec une amertume retombant très vite. Je me pose donc deux questions. Quel est lintérêt pour Brewdog de commercialiser un tel produit et de gâcher du houblon pour un tel résultat? Si vous insistez vraiment, mettez tout de même un sirop de votre choix pour agrémenter cette bière.","FRANCE","jybi"

2552,"2017-03-15",3.3,"The beer looks very nice. The looks are quite normal for a hoppy ale. The color of the beer is a rather reddish amber. The beer is very clear. On top of the beer a slightly off white layer of soft but rough foam is formed. The bulk of the foam collapses quickly, leaving a thin drape. A lot of foam sticks to the edges of the glass. Not bad.
The smell of the beer is American Pale Ale like. You dont smell that the beer is almost alcohol free. And despite the low amount of malts, I do smell a malty base, giving the beer some sweeter touches and a tiny tastiness. On top of this, there are delicious hop aromas. I smell New World hops, with aromas of pine and some citrus aromas. Not bad. It is a tiny bit more shallow than full beers, but it is not bad. 
The taste of the beer is also nice. It is a bit shallow. The hops are a bit less flavourful and also the malts are a bit weak. The beer does have a strong bitterness though. It the end there is a remarkable savoury thingy going on. But for a low alcohol beer, not bad. 
The palate is average. Rather low body, a bit thin texture, and medium to high carbonation. The finish has a nice bitterness. It misses some alcohol, which is very logical, because it just isnt there.","Capelle aan den IJssel, NETHERLANDS","Gangstergafje"

Patchy lacing and a small amount of carb visible. Aroma is lightly sweet with a fair amount of citrus-y, grassy, resinous hops, and an ever so slight roasty earten bitter edge. Taste is more or less 100% bitter, grassy hops. Grainy, earthen, slightly medicinal edge to the taste, bit of iodine almost. Dead leaves, bark. Almost completely empty of malt obviously but theres the tiniest hint of creamy sweetness. Finish is bone dry with astringent rubbery bitterness lasting ages. Body is light, texture is watery, carbonation is light, basically feels like drinking sparkling water as expected.

Appearance: head dissipates quickly, pours a dark copper / light brown colour.
Taste: decently bitter, with just a hint of malts to make it taste like beer. Plenty of hops: orange rind, grapefruit, some fruit juice. This is really out of balance in the way that hops win 5-0 against malts in it. Somewhat acidic but not sour (again, must be the hops with no malts to mask). Dry finish.
Palate: very thin. If this could be made a bit thicker without being sweeter it would come across a more alcoholic beer. Hardly surprising giving the 0.5% abv. Carbonation is fairly high. 
Overall: as far as alcohol free beers go, this is probably the best one around. Its pleasant to drink and hoppy, but could do with a bit more body. Its nearly ""carbonated hop juice"".","Cardiff, WALES","JKaranka"

2552,"2016-04-08",2.7,"UPDATED: JUL 5, 2016 After that infamous battle about making the strongest beer in the world, our friends of BrewDog apparently took it the other way and produced this hypo-alcoholic ISA. Pours a weird brownish, mahogany-hued copper colour, clear with no visible sparkling at all, under a thick, moussy, off-white, dense but slowly breaking head. Aroma of juniper berries, spruce shoots, dried grapefruit peel, some dried tomato, roasted peanuts, rainwater, caramel, raw spinach, dried mediterranean herbs. Clean, fairly neutral onset, dominated by some kind of basic sourishness with way too low - if any at all - sweet fruitiness for balance, soft carbo, thin and watery mouthfeel as can be expected from a beer of this ABV, nutty and toasted malts but in a watery environment, dryish finish with some retronasal dried grapefruit peel tendencies as well as a weak, watered-down peppery hops hint. Obviously a beer of this weakness will never produce a malt body thick and solid enough to counter for this amount of hops: this is an understatement of a session IPA, rich enough in terms of aroma alone, but somehow the complete lack of (malty) body makes this taste like (lightly) sparkling water hopped with some overly fragrant American piney hop variety. The hops dominate against almost nothing - needless to say, this table beer is completely out of balance. My guess is that this would have been a lot better if the hop dosis would have been toned down a bit - agreed it would have been a lot more boring, but at least I would not have been left with the feeling I just drank heavily American hopped water... Good for the tick but this irritates me probably more than anything else I ever had from this hyped brewery - move on to the next.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Good effort to brew a low alcohol beer with at least SOME taste to it (Becks Blue, Im looking squarely in your direction), but it just seems to fall a bit flat. A shame from an otherwise great brewer.","","ElectroMod"

Amber in colour wi a dark white frothy head. Noses mainly of citrus and floral hops with a hint of bready malts. The texture is soft and clearly the hop flavours are predominant. Interesting since most beers in this ABV range have a focus on the malt. The taste is light sweet and bitter and the hop predominates which makes the body very light.

Hopped up to begin with along with some floral notes and a touch of tea which I wasnt expecting. It is quite strong at points and there is some background pine and a bit of grapefruit.

Bland right at the start with touches of hops and pine but these are pretty minimal. There is a lot of bitter that follows this and again some floral notes but thats about it really. Not a great taste and in fact barely drinkable.

Started out really well and I was beginning to think there was actually a low alcohol beer out there that would be able to compete with some pretty good pale ales however the second I took a taste of it I knew that wasnt the case. A pretty poor beer, up there with the worst if taken on taste alone.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

Wow, right out of the bottle, huge piny nose with the dank and lots of very pronounced earthy and forresty notes, heavy citrus (grapefruit) and cracker.  A ton of resin and oil.  Deep amber pour with a delicate but rocky tan head.  Taste is extremely bitter, not a stretch to say its the bitterest beer Ive had, pound for pound, and at first I had doubts about finishing it.  Body is lightish and extremely dry, has a scratch grainy quality, and the bitterness in the aftertaste reminds much more of brutal espresso aftertaste, maybe a little mocha.  Lightly metallic but with nice woody overtones and light papery undertones (theres absolutely no doubt that Centennial and Simcoe were heavily used here, and Id guess Amarillo for the dank).  Tongue stripping and a little rubbery.  If anything, this proves there are significant benefits to balance.  I wonder if Id like this more if Id been a smoker, or if theyd added some lactose, or if Ill come around after some more experience; its not extreme to the point where Id dare someone to drink it for the look on their face, its just in that gimmick territory where theres no desire to repeat even a few ounces.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

7 Lovely hoppy aroma, fruity and crisp.
3 Clear reddy orange, small head
6- Fairly simple hop-oriented taste, barky bitterness, some sweet fleshy fruits, some flap-jacky malts.
3- Thin and watery, palate, crisp carbonation (how can they get that without force carbonating, Im sure 0.5% isnt enough fermentation to get much CO2 into the beer?) Finish is a bit metallic, some iron definitely, spoiling the show. Possibly because of the levels of hopping, the hoppy finish is a bit muddled. 5 characterful hop varieties do _not_ make a beer 5 times characterful, if anything you end up with something that has less character. (C.f. everything louder than everything else.)
10 Before opening, because I abhor the media-whoring BrewDog do, I wanted to hate this. On pouring, and smelling the hoppy vapours I changed my mind and I wanted to like this. Alas on tasting it couldnt deliver what the aroma promised, so was a little disappointed. I suspect Ive been a little generous with the points,in truth.

Very thin body, semi-smooth mouthfeel. Medium amount of carbonation.
Comment:

What an interesting beer!  It shocked me with its big fluffy foam and appealing ruby liquid. I could smell it as I was pouring it and it had the smell that would make most IPAs green with envy. However that was the best part of this beer. The taste is basically hoppy water with little to no malt to support it. But that is to be expected by this kind of beer. However I cant help but wonder if there isnt a way to add more body without increasing the level of alcohol. Definitely something to consider for an experimental brew some time in the future.

Anyway back to this beer. I have to say its a very nice low alcohol beer, I would definitely buy it again if I wanted to stay sober. Might be a good choice if I ever have to be the driver.","Örebro, SWEDEN","olsvammel"

After a while the slightly toffee-ish malts appear and gives a sort of balance to it, and a faint roasted note too. Its quite thin on the palate, but not really thin. Nicely carbonated too. Theres lots of tropical fruits and green pine cones in the flavor, enough bitterness to provide great drinkability, and also some bready, caramel malts and a little roasted touch. The finish has pine cones and a pleasant bitterness, the malts left in the background. It drinks better than the 1.1% edition, and is equally damn good for a beer at this strenght, would have been fun having them side by side.

My initial feeling is that it is more drinkable than the 1.1% old version (will do a side-by-side taste soon and will probably re-rate the old one) and if you want the hops of an APA on a school night, then it definitely does the job.
