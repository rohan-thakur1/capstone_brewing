1383,"2016-11-04",3.6,"Aroma is a hint of smoke, grain and grass. Pours a clear dark brown color with a lasting foamy tan head. A full bodied feel with a taste of smoked malt and unsweetened chocolate with a light bitter finish. A very drinkable beer.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","Luvystypotables"
1383,"2014-11-15",3.5,"Poured from bottle. Roasty and nutty aromas. Taste is slightly bitter. Medium body with bitter aftertaste. Interesting combination of lager and a dark beer.","Halifax, Nova Scotia, CANADA","DomD"
1383,"2014-11-08",4.1,"Pours a beautiful ruby brown with a big off white head. Aroma is of liquorice, roasted malts, raisins, and leather. Tastes of smoke, chocolate, liquorice, and leather, but all of it light. Has a medium body and average carbonation and is quite smooth and quaffable for how dark it is. I do believe the beer outdoes the event it was brewed for.","Stratford, Prince Edward Island, CANADA","Hidden_Pooch"
1383,"2014-11-05",3.6,"This beer of the night looks just divine, a huge pillowy tan head that sticks around and leaves a lace magnificent, all atop a dark rusty brown body. Style-wise it is sort of confusing. Its fairly hoppy, herbal and piney with some light spiciness. There are also potent notes of coffee, chocolate and dark fruitcake tartness. Its sort of like a CDA/Pale Lager/Dunkel hybrid. Overall, though a bit muddled, this is a solidly enjoyable dark brew. I do wish the mouthfeel was a wee bit thicker.","Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, CANADA","BrewGoblin"
1383,"2013-09-23",3.4,"500ml bottle into a pint glass. Pours gorgeously with a deep mahogany/garnet colour with light lacing to the edges of the glass. Roasty malty nose, with a slightly smoky (almost burnt rubber?) flavour. Lively carbonation on the tongue. Slight dark chocolate finish. Kind of a lingering, somewhat nutty after-taste.","Nova Scotia, CANADA","plaugher"
1383,"2012-12-24",3.9,"Bottle thanks to gethinbeer. Deep brown pour with a thick, creamy tan head. The aroma is very clean with a soft dark chocolate and roasted coffee aroma. A touch of brown malt and a bit of soft roast as well. Palate is soft and creamy but with a nice assertive roastiness. Clean dark chocolate on the finish. Lovely brew, really. More schwarzbier than dunkel - but it kind of skirts the edge a bit.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
1383,"2012-11-04",3.4,"lively carbonation, clear brown colour. aromas of light roast, malted and a sweet chocolate note. slight burnt toast flavour, medium bodied and a bitter finish and oily texture.","Canadiana, Ontario, CANADA","Bendrixian"
1383,"2012-10-30",3.7,"Roasty malt aroma, clear dark appearance with a thin tan head. Light - med. body, lightly hopped, lively carbonation. Pleasant malty taste with notes of chocolate and slighter notes of nuts. Nice lager.","Nova Scotia, CANADA","Cellar_dweller"
1383,"2012-10-14",4.1,"Lovely dark amber colour with frothy white head. Aroma of roasted crystal malts. Roasted malt flavour with chocolate. Hop bitterness. Toasty bitter finish. Very nice, quaffable beer.","Nova Scotia, CANADA","Gethinbeer"
1383,"2012-10-05",3.1,"500ml bottle. Pours a very deep mahogany with average tan head that leaves a little lace down the glass. Chocolate and nuts on the nose. Lightly bitter with a mostly nutty roasted flavour that finishes with a bit of dark chocolate.","Halifax, Nova Scotia, CANADA","Atheist_Peace"
