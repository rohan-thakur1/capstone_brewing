It has a nice oily texture in the mouth and its just about average on the carbonation. Creamy almost in the mouth. Sweet citrussy. White sugar, some needles, a little oaky mouthdrying thing.

3278,"2016-01-29",4.1,"On tap at The Reservoir, Waterbury, VT, this was poured into a tulip.
The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with a bar pours kind of slim little head, quickly dissipates and leaves barely any lacing.
The smell started off with boozy bourbon sweetness running into the normal qualities of a Tripel or in this case Curieux and then as it warms, the coffee comes out nice and sweet. The differences of the sweet coffee (cold pressing) to the tripel qualities of iced apples and sweet breadiness really come together well and make it a really nice aroma.
The taste was moderately sweet through the Curieux qualities. Bourbon sits back a bit more in the flavor and gives off a slight sweet blend in the aftertaste. Semi-sticky finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a medium on the body with a nice semi-smooth feel to it. I think that cold pressed coffee was a great idea as it really felt great all around.

3278,"2014-04-04",4.1,"On tap at Joe Canals West Deptford.
Appearance: Milky hazy orange amber body with a short white head that quickly dissipates.
Aroma: The aroma is very odd, vanilla creamer, roasted peanuts, hints of coffee, and a touch of bourbon.
Taste: Bourbon runs mildly through a creamy slightly fruit tripel. Vanilla works through it with banana leading to a heavily creamer coffee/roasted peanut finish. The finish lingers a touch of booze with bourbon. Its an odd mix, but it works.
Palate: Creamy with moderate carbonation.
Overall: This is excellently executed despite being an odd concept. This is balanced through the flavors nicely and despite some of them not being common together it works.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

3278,"2014-03-19",3.9,"Draught at Publick House, 3/14/14Looks like Curieux, that is to say, bright golden with a hint of amber and a fluffy, well-retained head.Soft coffee in the nose still allows light peach/apricot esters and bourbon notes in. Almost a light vanilla-chocolate interplay and quite light on the alcohol. Fairly strong aroma and Im glad Im just smelling espresso....Deceptively beer-like in flavor. You certainly get the coffee up front, clean, lightly bitter and with plenty of vanilla flavor. However, malt kicks in, adding light sweetness with a touch of biscuity malt. Some lightly acidic notes along with yeast esters begin to give an almost citric-like impression as the bourbon and coffee sit somewhat dryly on the finish. Actually liked this a lot more than Curieux (which I dont care for much at all, thanks to the heavy bourbon), as the coffee blotted out some of the heavy bourbon character, added a silky-slickness to the texture and seemed to be in balance. Of course, you certainly lose a fair amount of the Belgian nature of the beer, but for what it is, I think it works fine.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Appearance: Heavily hazed, darkened gold body with a nearly white head, just shy of a full inch.

Smell: My stars! Certainly a stronger coffee aroma than I had anticipated, delightfully roasty, nutty. Undertone of gently sweet-scented bourbon notes. Faintly fruity, with a bit of lemon, leaving little of the original tripel to recognize.

Taste: Sweetish flavor of roasted coffee beans -- it really does have a surprising depth of coffee in the taste. No, really, it does! Caramel, vanilla, and wooden bourbon accents follow. Then, way waaaay back is the original Allagash Tripel. Ultra faint citrus. Sweetish, coffee finish with a sliver of bourbon and a slight, warming alcohol quality.
