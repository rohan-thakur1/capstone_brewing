Pours a glowing, golden color with a bubbly, immediately vanishing white head, which leaves back tiny bubbles at the edge of the glass, wrapped up by fluffy lacing.

On the nose, the beer offers well pronounced apple peel, accompanied by a distinct funkiness and old leather. Tomato bush blends into earthy, dusty malts, accompanied by even more dried garden herbs, leading to a very organcic, leafy impression, coated up by moldy funk. Tree bark becomes visible amongst this aroma profile, lending the beer additional earthiness, creating a very versatile, intriguing nose.

Has a lower carbonation with an almost biting lemon sourness, while finishing more on soft mineralic stone qualities with a very pleasant mouthfeel after the initial punch.

Begins with an aqueous note, joined by intense, but fruity, lemon, balanced by stale, dusty earth defined malts. Lemon stampedes over the tongue in an uncomprimising fashion, clashing at the back end of the palate and dissipates, while leaving back a trail of juicy lime pulp, very earthy, old rock sugar and forest earth. The taste remains focused on the multifaceted lemon, which also lends a nice dryness to the finish, softened by a mineralic aqueous note and a vinegar sourness.

Overall a very tart, fruit focussed Gueuze, while its sourness seems to evolve completely from the fruits, as it isnt overpowering any of the other flavors, but adds to their complexity, and therefore remains its natural appearance.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Low carbonation but what the heck do you expect with a beer this old. Truly a beer I will remember for ages. Huge thanks for sharing. 1988 bottle with Frank, and Bill last week.

377,"2012-09-13",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 4, 2012 9/13/12
Had kept this one for probably 6 months and was ready for it.  Cracked after a meal.

Pours a dark orange.  Wasnt a lot of pop from the cork, so makes sense not a lot of bubble.  Slight lace on top.

Smell is funk, sour, wet wool, and fruity.  I typically love the smell, but perhaps the lactic acid is a touch over the top for my liking 

Taste is puckering, fruity sourness.  Youd think the brett would be more over the top given the nose, but it isnt which is a good thing IMHO.  Its a sipper though.  The follow-through is the best part of it.  Really pleasant tasty sour follows through to the end, leaving just a bit of lingering flavor.  This is why I drink this beer.

Still a newb in this style, but mouthfeel leaves a little to be desired.  More carbonation would satisfy, of course.  Left it on its side in wine fridge for 6 months, perhaps should have stored upright.  Still enjoyed and will revisit.

The beer is hazy and light orange hued, with an inch of white head that fades to nothing after a few moments. The aroma is of authentic Belgian gueuze: funk, straw, farmyard, light citrus. The taste is very pleasant, with a subtle biting sharpness in the finish. The acetic feel in the back end is more prominent here than in some of my favorite gueuzes. Overall, a solid example of the style, and definitely worth a try.

A - Pours murky golden yellow with a nice one finger tall white head, quickly dissipating down to a small ring around the outside of the glass, leaving light trails of lace down parts of the glass.

S - Smells of the typical barnyard funk, light sourness, wet leather, lemon and some damp basement must. I prefer a little more fruitiness in my gueuze nose but this one was still pretty good.

T - Starts off with quite a bit of lactic sourness but it fades rather quickly leaving hints of musty earth, barnyard funk, leather and a bit of lemon twang. The flavors work really well together and it was very easy to drink. Finish is pretty dry, lingering on the pallet for quite awhile after consumption.

M - Slick feel like the others but the flavors are more mild, helping keep everything in check. Still a little light on the carbonation but it isnt as big of a deal as with the other two.

O - The best of the bunch for sure. Where the Kriek and Raspberry fail, this one excels. Tone down the overly aggressive sourness and this one could be great. As it stands now, a solid gueuze that is definitely worth the lower than average price tag.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

A pretty good gueuze.  Edit: 750ml bottle.  Pours hazy golden/amber.  Aroma of sourness and funkiness, light oak, some light malts.  Flavor a great blend. Average texture for the style.

377,"2012-03-03",3.9,"Bottled, unknown vintage.  Poured apple juice golden with just some wisps of white head.  The aroma picked up juicy and tart lighter fruit skins and vinegar paired with some horse blankets and damp earth.. mildly assertive, and just interesting enough.  The flavor opened acidic with lemon rind, apricot skins, and vinegar taking a layer off of the tongue.. aged oak joined in a similar vein on the middle.. fruity meat and musty barn deeper down.. finished sour and refreshing.

This beer brings some serious funk, along with a little junk in the trunk to go with it.  Pours a cloudy gold with no head to speak of.  Nose is funky, sour, barnyard, crotch cheese and citrus.  I really like the crotch cheese note - it reminds me of a girl I knew in college.  (As a side note, this girls nickname was ""Chicken wing"".  Pronounced Chick-En-Waaaang.  Not because of anything special she did with chicken wings, no - because her naughty bits smelled faintly of the blue cheese that often accompanies chicken wings.

Interesting note....the bottles were shipped on their sides interlocking with each other. There was zero wrap or protection around them. Scary!

A - A nice copper apple juice colored body. Small white head which settled into some edging. I was able to get a crystal clear pour and swirled the last ounce or so into a snifter.

S - Very funky and brett forward. Sour apples and lemon peel, hay, grass, yeast, and a strong funky burn. Towards the end there is a slightly off-putting fecal/chemical aroma.

T - Super tart and acidic. Ripe sour green apples and lemon juice. Funky hay and barnyard flavors. This is rather intense and harsh, which I personally enjoy. You can feel your taste buds being obliterated, but that taste and tartness keeps me coming back for more. Really great balance between fruit and funk. The mouth feel is crisp and lively, but the finish is really intense and biting.

O - This is a very acidic and intense gueze. Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen both bring the funk, but they do so in a much classier and elegant way. Perhaps its due to its freshness, but this is extremely tart and acidic at this point. Load of sour apple and lemons. Im sure with some more age it smooths out a bit into something that can compete with the big guys. A fantastic beer.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

It smells of fermented peaches, has some funk but what I would describe as a lot, and also features a mild tartness, and light alcohol. The flavors are much better than in my first gueuze experience. You actually get some fruit. It instantly bites your tongue with peach skin like tartness. Its almost the perfect amount of sour. It has light funk and wasnt heavy on sediment whatsoever. Perhaps the biggest difference is the mouthfeel. It has a nice crisp bite to it. I really like it. Im glad I tried this so it gives me better prospective on the style.

Lemon (heavy, heavy citrus) behind the metal and mixing with some barnyard.  Saliva production activated in earnest.  Touches of wood and wheat, touch of spice, aftertaste is akin to a sour Wit but with woody dryness and a lingering fruitiness.  Full body, bone dry, refreshing.

I immediately smell peach and brettanomyces funk while Im still pouring; a closer whiff reveals a deep fruitiness with peach, citrus, pear, strawberry, and sour grapes, along with lots of dank musty cellar character, a touch of oak, and young cheese. The flavor is assertively tart with a nice edgy acidity. A mild fruitiness is quite obvious, something like store-bought fruit cocktail, but without the gross syrup. The finish is more musty than sour, with a dank farm/hay quality. It lingers into the aftertaste as the fruitiness and acidity fade. The aftertaste is like a young creamy cheese, maybe along the lines of camambert. quite a satisfying gueuze.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

A distinct funky brett and barnyard dominance with secondary lemons, rubber, lemonade, lactic acid, bread dough and flaked wheat. Potent on the nose, warmth brings out straw and bigger citrusy sour fruit elements, some crab apple, and pineapple. Initial is lighter bodied, sharper sour fruits and lemons mingle with wet oak, lactic acid and yogurt, bread dough moving into a smaller funky brett presence than the nose let on.

Appearance:  Golden, straw-colored appearance.  Slight head that dissipated quickly.  Little to no lacing, drinking out of a snifter.
Taste:  Extremely sour and funky.  I can pick up notes of fruit but not much sweetness from them.  The sour/tartness here reminds me of the sourness that comes from a warhead (candy).
Mouthfeel:  Very sharp, crisp, and carbonated.  This beer has a fizzling effect on my tongue and a puckering effect on my cheeks.

377,"2011-03-16",4.1,"375ml green corked and caged bottle. I honestly cant figure out the vintage.

IT pours a honey gold, a very nice color with a fizzy soapy white head that leaves walls of lacing all the way around the glass.

Off the bat it is noticeable tart in the smell. After the initial sour cringe it is nicely subtle with a few different scents in play. It has mostly an acidic smell with lemons and vinegar, but there is a noticeable funky must to it that may remind one of an old closet or an open field that has been inhabited by cattle. There is just a bit of grain in the smell along with some very faint vanilla notes.

The flavor continues with the tartness, though it is more in the mid-palate than up front or in the aftertaste. It has almost a lemony plastic flavor to it at first, which I found odd, but after a few more sips the plastic fades and the acidic lemon stays. There is an adequate amount of malt present in the flavor. It is a dry beer but there a thick enough mouthfeel to give the slightest bit of caramel characteristics to the malt bill. It also has an almost tea-like characteristic. Some oxidized green apple comes through as it warms. It is a very clean tasting Gueuze, though there is some funk, it just seems that even though it is wild, it is also quite symmetrical.

A very nice beer.

Awesome cheesy, briny, funky, sweaty nose. Just spot on geuze. Taste is very sour, full of acedic acid, white sushi vinegar, wet leather, spicy oak. It is so sour that it will make you sweat. The briny cheese character feels like youve had ocean water go up your nose and it clears out your sinuses rather forcefully. After a full 750 of this (no one in my group would touch this thing), it becomes pretty lacerative on the palate. But this would happen to just about anyone that tries to put down a 750mL sour bomb like this by themselves. Sometimes I wish it were more subtle and bretty like some Cantillon offerings.

Rerate 9/26/11- on cask at Pizzeria Paradiso in Dupont. Such a mindblowingly insane experience the second time around. Hugely sour, way more intense than the bottle version that I had, and also had some really intense peaty wood presence; I truly couldnt figure this out.

Very light on the acetic, but loads of lactic acid, gives a hint of puckering fruity sweetness mid after the tart assault and before the dry finish.

Pretty rtame for the style but still plenty flavorful. Not as funky earthy or acidic as i expected but still enough of the sour tartness and barnyard funk to make it epsecially mouthwatering. Slightly oak with a perfect amount of tart sournes that balances out the sweet estery golden fruit notes. Creamy medium body which again is unusual for the style with a lactic funk. Subtle malty backbone which is more pronounced than most examples of the style.

When I bought this, the guy behind the counter said, ""Just so you know--this isnt a sweet lambic."" Bless your heart kid, I know. Shiny gold pour, good persistent white head. Oh wow, what a beautiful aroma. The cool earthy smell of walking through a field of tall grass on an early fall morning. Fresh cracked black pepper, preserved lemons, a whole lumberyard full of old wood, and tingling on the edges, a cheerful little candied apple note. Flavor is bracing lemon sourness, full and pleasing but by no means the enamel dissolving acid bombs of some of Cantillons more aggressive blends. Enthusiastic and all-together pleasing, wool and gentle oak notes. I try to restrain evil-genius-type laughter as I survey the 2/3s of a bottle still remaining after typing out this rating. Mine!

Nicely aggressive acidity attacks the under-tongue (just like a gueuze should).  Finish is bretty funk with lingering juicy fruitiness and a thin layer of confectioners sugar sweetness, and the acidity still attacking the glands in waves.

377,"2009-04-07",3.6,"375ml bottle. Pours a crystal clear, bright orange body with lots of initial rising carbonation. Thin, fizzy, loud, white head that leaves a good amount of runny, soapy lacing. Aroma is sweet and sour fruits (apples and grapefruits mostly), acidic vinegar, dry wood, and champagne. Very strong. I dont get the cheese that some others have noted, but I am a novice when it comes to this style. Flavor is initially sour, but really mellows out and shows a light maltiness through the finish. Lots of citric flavors up front that diminish smoothly into the finish, but remain present. Theres an ever present tartness that Im liking because it never gets lip smacking tart. A light woody note at first and a subtle drying finish. The lingering flavor is a mix between an earthy funk and sour tart. Palate is light to medium and surprisingly has a flat carbonation. Overall, Im not very experienced with rating this style of beer, but this one seems to be pretty flavorful and well balanced. It stays sweet and equally sour without ever leaning too much towards one or the other. A good introduction.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Sampling Notes:
Served chilled in pilsner glass.
Decent pop upon uncorking, pours a hazy gold body with a bit of white foam that eventually dies down into a dense ring.
Vinegary nose, gets right up into the nostrils, some oakiness and sherry-nuances come with it, big minerally saltiness, sour/fermenting apple and lemon.
Plenty of acetic acidity on the tongue, goes hand-in-hand with the lively carbonation and light body for a serious mouth puckering sensation.
Balsamic vinegar aplenty on the body, green apple, soggy wood, sour grapes, grapefruit with an underlying grainy, honey sweetness adding a small bit of balance.
Doesnt seem as complex as previous ones, still amazing and a journey within itself, but somehow not as refined and coherent...if that makes any sense!

Citrus, mainly lemon and grapefruit, apple, vinegar, and barnyard notes all interact seamlessly on the palate. Flavor is tart, but not as much as I expected from the aroma. Long, dry, fairly sour finish.   Delicious and incredibly drinkable.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","kkearn"
377,"2008-08-27",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2010 Bottle. Pours a hazy weird off-yellow with a pillowing white head. I can smell this stuff as soon as I pop the cork. Not for the faint of heart, this beer is seriously sour. Putting my nose to the snifter is more intense than putting my nose directly to a jug of vinegar. Intensity aside, this has a fantastic array of wild, funky aromas: cheese, hay, goats, lemon, serious malt vinegar. The spritzy mouthfeel does well to compliment the tartness of the flavor. Its no surprise when the puckering onslaught hits my palate. It moves through some layers, starting with the sharp vinegar character and moving towards a wild, tart funk. This never becomes sweet or forgiving. I dont get much bottom end in this one. Props for its unabashed use of bacterial quality. This is one of the most aggressive of all soured beer Ive encountered.

Bottle at the Map Room. Hanssens remains one of my favorite Lambics, especially the gueuze. It is one of the most potently sour examples of the style and still retains complexity and cleanliness. Plenty of fruity notes and oak are present in the aroma along with the rich vinegar-type sourness. The palate is medium and the flavor makes for a wonderful sipper. Grass, fruits and all kinds of wooden complexity mingle with the potent tartness. Delicious.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Poured a cloudy yellow color, leaves a light lacing around the glass. Smell was sour and funky, definate barnyard smell. Taste was sour and reminded me of a horse in a barn eating rotten fruit. Average carbonation and light bodied. I couldn’t drink all of mine, I just didn’t care for it. 

Additional info: I’m sure this is spot on for the style, but this was my first try at the style. I didn’t seem to care for Oud Bruin’s the first time I tried them, but I love them now. So even though this won’t be given high scores from me, I definately think it’s worth trying and I will be trying it again, hopefully enjoying then.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

377,"2008-06-13",4.1,"Clean dandelion hued pour and a rim of whitish that hollows out an attractive, coincidentally perfect imprinted ring in the center into the surface center.  Minerally bitterness and lemon zest in a sharp, lightly cheesy and unusually polished aroma; there isnt much dirtiness or animals-on-the-farm feeling, but the yeasty presence is dusty and brisk enough to maintain the right aura.  A green apple and guava-like sunny sweetness lends some easy, likable fruitiness which provides some depth, although I usually prefer this quality as a startling afterthought to the elusive funkiness, which in this example just isnt all there.  Still lovely.

Flavor is hugely acidic, punchy, and musty; a whiff of aged balsamic settles in a dust on a gorgeous tropical fruitiness of pineapple and golden kiwi.  These fruit flavors are really rushed to the front by the beers palpable acidity.  Lightly wooden bitterness and then more fruit and tang; apricot, orange peel, and pickled ginger.  Mid palate is suddenly, alarmingly struck with an outhouse and wet hay funkiness that makes me shiver and pucker; the experiential aspect it seemed to lack earlier makes a glorious, confronting appearance. 

Medium body is sparkly but soft; finishes with a heated, spicy sourness of lemon juice and cayenne pepper, that calms itself slowly into a vanilla-tinted appley tartness.  Still some minerals hanging around.  

A persistently classical feeling about this fine gueuze is probably its finest quality.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Been sitting on a small 2007 bottle for a few years. Wanted to see what this behaved like at 5 years. Totally worth saving and totally worth opening. Dammit this is stellar.

Its almost equivalent to licking a fresh cut lemon and chasing it with a shot of apricot nectar and grapefruit juice.  The citrus notes are bold, as is the funky barnyard yeast.

Looks like a cloudy american lager or darker wheat.  Really nice creamy carbonation. Oh my, what a taste impact!  Not girlie sweet in any way though wonderfully  tart.

Hanssens is really up there because of the no-nonsense lip-pickering madness they produce, and their deceptive simplicity. This has got all that lemony, acidic bracing sourness in the finish, with just enough pedio that you know its  there but really have to look for it because it is buried deep beneath that horse blanket. And its got so much more than that. Its got that leathery ""horseblanket"" aroma, which is deep and evocative and heavy on the soul. Drinking this beer is like making love in the hay. Its raw, a little rough around the edges, smelly, and fun. Scrumptious and appealing on many levels.  It tastes really alive. Accessible and not shy: in your face, and not ashamed of it.

Flavors of apricot, tart apple, and peach skin immediately greet the tastebuds, and the beer suddenly switches to the more acidic lemon, oak, and brett within the mid-palate.

Not mouth puckering, and has a sugary flavor, but it is quite dry.  The flavor doesnt seem quite as complex as the aroma, and the aftertaste is tart and earthy.  Light acetic flavor but its not strong, and adds to the complexity of flavors.  High level of carbonation, lighter body, and dry m/f.  Im still not a big fan of lambics... AKA sour beers.

High carbonation is displayed on the palate and by fierce jet-streams that rocket upward to the head. Huge, cloying body.

Gueuze is an acquired taste, and few drinkers enjoy their initiation to this style.

The flavor almost hints at some grape juice sweetness but pulls back before it can actually happen.  This is pretty tart and tangy, though not the most sour gueuze Ive ever encountered (not that Ive had that many).  The flavor pulls back on the funkiness a tad bit and some moderately bitter earthiness shows up just before the dry finish. The oaky quality isnt quite as noticeable as is in some brews.  Light to moderate carbonation, medium bodied.  Very good, I have a feeling some cheeses would go great with this (dont ask me what kind).","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

This one was the final beer of the evening (okay, so we moved on to Celebration after this..) but after talking it up to my family about the experience in drinking a gueuze, they were ready. Aroma was funky with green apples, hay, funk, leather and cheese. I did find this much more fruity than expected. Appearance was hazy with a yellowish/orange color, normal head. Flavors were acidic, tart, fruity, funky, and leather all wrapped around a citric lemony background. No sweetness here with a nice dry finish.

I am not joking when I say nothing has changed from a tasting 2 years ago. Still mega intense with massive licks of salt, acid, sour apricots, murky old grape fruits. Lots of complexity and acid to burn (and it does burn!). This is a 3yr beer that needs another 5 years in the cellar before approaching. Feels more rough than previous tastings. Points as per the Nov 2008 tasting.
November 2008 (BB 8/2027)
Real deal gueuze and its great to see them in Australia. Apricot orange in colour with a slightly murky overlay. Nose is kinda mild in terms of fruit lift but the insensity from the sour gueuze fruits and salt gives the senses a whack. Nice grapey / winery notes as well. Whacked again in the palate with a big olive / salty / sour kick. Acid drives a lingering finish with a touch of burn and plenty of bubbles keeps the beer dancing nicely. As powerful as any gueuze getting around right now.
March 2007 (3.9)
More serious gueze. Quite similar to the Boon but probably ups the intensity. Plenty of sour grapes and piercing tartness, both to smell and taste. Some lemon and citrus comes through later, as well as some serious Burgundian pinot fruit aromas (Jancis would be impressed!). Acidity gives a slightly hot, rusty finish. Great aparitif alternative to sparkling wine.","Phuket, THAILAND","Stew41"

Color is a darkish yellow...almost an amber color.  For someone accustomed to other (dare I say more conventional) beer styles, it seems a bit dull versus a sparkling Pilsner Urquell, but not uninviting.

The smell of this is powerful.  I pick up a fruity citrusness, something like lemon-lime soda.

377,"2006-01-23",3.6,"Sampled from two different bottles in a gueuze tasting. 
Just above average of the gueuze I had so far. As many other gueuze, the aroma is not very evocative being barnyard/horseblanket, citrus/apple. Both poured dark orange and hopefully hazy. The sample from the first bottle (A) was surprisingly sweet, much more then the second one B). The body was also different, (A) being lighter the (B). Eventhough they were kind of funky, the dustiness is disappointing in (A) but wonderful in (B) just like astringency. There is an apparent signature; but evidently, this gueuze is very different from a bottle to another. Since I cant make a distinction between the two bottles (theyre identical) the rating is therefore an average.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Siroy"

Intense flavors that are similar to the aroma.  Very sour, but not palate-crushingly sour like Cantillion Gueuze.  Very dry, vinous finish.  Stank yet refreshing.

But this beer was definitly fantastic.  Nice apple/fruit aroma and taste.  Sour to a near perfect point, and actually funky.  Wasnt sure what that meant until I was fully indulged in this brew.  Same thing goes for cobwebs, basement, barnyard, and leather all notes previously mentioned that nearly turned me off to this beer.  But actually its all there and makes for a hell of a beer.

377,"2004-10-25",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 28, 2006 Cloudy golden-orange. Gentle white ring. Gueuzes scent can be smelled from far. Probably the most expressive cheese aromas Ive experienced. Incredibly funky, horsey, sweaty, leathery, plastic-like even. Cider, basement, cobwebs notes etc. Superb yeast development. Fairly adequate malt base reminds of honey hence its not all about sourness. Truly a top echelon gueuze that does everything right and more. One Id keep a stash of, this and cuvée rené. Dry oaky palate with loads of yeast complexities. Cider like dryness develops toward the acidic funky finish. FUNKY. I love it. Medium to full body, low-medium carbonation. How can you not admire a product that presents all those flavors that would be considered of in basically almost any other style with such gracious eccentricity and agility is something I cant understand. Underated.  Ive come to realize that this is one very irregular lambic. Where some bottles have been the funkiest gueuze examples Ive had, others seem middle of the pack, so I have to reconsider my previous stamement, but Im leaving the score of my first experiences.

Nose is distinctively less bretty than many gueuzes Ive had the opportunity to try. Hot bacon and pork products are present though not as overpowering as say Girardin black or cantillon vignerrone. Musky fruit, crackling bacon A very simple yet pleasing aroma. Flavors are round for a gueuze. Lots of fruitiness. Leather and horseblanket play pattycake with a mellow fruity ale yeast that isnt overpowering but isnt letting go either. Distincitively mellow for a gueuze. Could be slightly ""hotter"" with bretts but will definitely do. Afterpalate of a very mellow merlot.

The sourness is all encompising, but is quite nice. Quite acidic, it reminds me of vinegar. There is a faint smoky bite on the front end. I like everything about this except this weird taste that I cannot describe on the backend.","Carrollton, Texas, USA","Lumpy"
377,"2004-10-07",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 21, 2006 Undated bottle.  Without reading or remembering anything about this beer, Im excited to give a completely unbiased review (except that gueuzes are my favorite beer, ahem).  Pours a golden straw color, slight rusty yellow/coppers.  Little head retention, quite bubbly.  Relatively small amount of sediment, but still enough to please me.  Aroma is quite unique.  Very acidic, reminds me of pear skin, grape skin and sour lemon.  Almost like unripe limes.  Yes, I do believe unripe lime is it here.
Nowhere near as much horseblanket, funk, cheese(dont even really smell any cheesey bacteria) as say Cuvee Rene or Drie Font.  Thats ok though, to each lambic his own and Im just happy that its got its own character. 
Flavor is tart at the beginning, with light light citrus, good full yeastiness and some sour lemon and grapefruit.  On the end, this stuff gets really good; that unripe lime flavor, sour pear skin, orange peel, a bit of sweet malt (nowhere near as sweet as 3F) and even a hint of hops, perhaps?  Another unique characterisitic of this one was the oily, leathery, acidic grapeskin quality coming on at the start and again on the finish.
Body is medium-full, with a soft but ever-present carbonation that gives the tartness a nudge in the right direction.  As it breathes, gains almost a light creamy sweetness on the end, though only in passing.  Lots of lemon-lime-pear lingers on the finish, with light yeast as well.  Outstanding and quite a good balance.  I prefer the extra bacterial, ultra funky, barnyard lambics and saisons, but this one was magnificent in its own right.  To be constructive, this one was a bit lighter bodied than the others Ive tried, though the flavor was so eminently quaffable.Another (likely 2003) bottle (beige label, purple lettering) consumed Summer 05 at Sunset Grille.  Just about as good as it gets for a gueuze.  I can see now why this is regarded so highly by many.  The aroma is just something else!  Pure horseshit, wet barnyard notes.  Wow, nice and strong.  Flavor is cheesy, heavily funky and only moderately sour.  The only moderate amount of sourness is probably further attractive to those who desire a more balanced acidity/sourness.  Juicy apples are quite present as well.  Wonderfully round and creamy texture with very tight carbonation.  Undated bottle consumed 11/05, label pictured at left.  Yep, fascinating again, though not quite as funky.  Obviously older and more mellowed out, but still quite cheesy and appley.  Perfect texture/carbonation again.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Aroma of sweaty socks, pearskin, and general sourness.  The taste is very harsh and challenging at first like pickling vinegar and very sour lemons.  It then mellows out into a clean crisp fruity (but again) sour drink.

I cannot say how many Gueuze reviews I have read here and have seen the ubiquitous ""barnyard, but without the shit"" and ""lots of stinky cheese"" type aroma comments, but that matches this brew's character perfectly. The flavor of this one is big and complex, lingering almost like a slow motion replay that is trying to figure out if that darned puck crossed the line or not. Starts malty, then explodes with that Jolly Rancher sweet and sour type candi flavor. The palate is creamy and smooth, and just mashes the senses into a pulp.

377,"2004-01-25",4.0,"UPDATED: NOV 14, 2004 Thanks to thedm and hotstuff for ""sharing"" this bottle with me, even if they both poured it.  Hazy yellow orange color with almost no head.  Very much a citric acid aroma, not unlike lemons and grapefruit.  The flavor reminded me of a sourball I used to get as a kid.  However, this is much better.  Much like an extremely sour lemondae.

377,"2004-01-10",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 19, 2013 Hazy orange, decent head to start but subsequently faded with each pour into nothingness.  Aroma was almost pure funk, a latrine on a hot summer day, and a touch of apple.  Almost off-putting, and I even like this quality in a gueuze.  Flavors matched the aroma, along with the predictable sourness, added horseblanket and barnyard flavors.  A challenging, 12 round main event of a beer.  Cant believe Im saying this, but I would have liked a little less funk.  RERATE:  From Slutfest - Horseblanket, lemon, cheddar.  Flavors match, with an almost rich horse note.

At first pour, it was clear and golden with a huge head that faded quickly, like champagne; in the second pour -- with the sediment -- it was cloudy and orangey. Bright, effervescent and champagne-like mouthfeel. Very tart and sour with some nice and yeasty aromas (earthy and a little musty). Other notes of gum-numbing vinegar (acetic).

Flavors of dry oak, dry aged cheese, dry sour apples, dry grape skins and a hint of malt sweetness in the linger. Just a refreshing monster of a gueuze.

The aroma was very strong, and not too pleasant (though I did get used to it). Head is white and creamy. Body is a rich gold with a little haziness in it. Initial taste: WOW. Its taste was completely unexpected. Tastes like lemon champagne or something. Initial flavor is very much like sour lemons (as opposed to the sweet ones).

Smells tart like vinegar but also smells like a burning rubber tire. The taste is definitely tart but with some over ripened fruit, hay, barnyard and basement all vying for first place on your tongue.

The flavor starts out subtle, but then quickly attacks with an earthy vengeance and finishes tart like a fresh lemon.  Yes, you can taste the years of maturity in the ecosystem that surrounds the cooling ships for the sources of this blend of old and new.  As it warms, there is more of an earthy punch right in the middle; it does not hold back.  It is quite fascinating; makes me want to take some organic chemistry classes.  Overall, this is very good.

377,"2003-08-26",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2005 First gueuze here, bare with me on this. Given that I love sour tastes, this seems like a style for me. I have no idea how this stacks up against other gueuzes, obviously. Aroma of apple, moldy cheese, sweatsocks, ripe farms. Heres some obvious comments: sour champagne taste with dry finish. I found it tough to tease out more complex flavors, so a rerate may be in order. It seems to me that gueuzes are just inherently complex anyways. Very nice.

377,"2003-07-24",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 3, 2013 Consistently the most balanced of the Gueuzes.  Has a wonderful subtle (for a gueuze) citrusy acidity.  Quite complex, with changing notes of barnyard, oak, and a funky mushroom type flavor.  The beer is quite dry, but still has a subtle sweetness that adds to the overall aroma.  Musty and sour, with hints of enteric.  At first it is sourly citrusy, then the mustiness and enteric comes through. There is almost a hint of orange in the taste.  It finishes with a bit of astringency (think of black tea).
2012 Vintage; Sampled April 2013
4.2, 8/5/8/4/17
A steady pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a finger and a half thick, pale tan colored head. The beer is a bright amber hue that shows a absolutely brilliantly clear, bright, almost metallic copper hue when held up to the light. Ah, the aroma is funky, woody, tart, and musky, just like a really good Gueuze should be. Specific aromatics of urea, musty oak wood notes, light oak spice, lactic tartness, musky barnyard notes, sweat stained leathery notes, musty medicinal notes, a supporting but wholesome grain character, rounded pale-toasted oak and malt, and there is a soft, supporting, ripe fruitiness that suggests of floral apples, perhaps a touch of musky melon, and perhaps something a bit more like starfruit, in addition to a solid grapefruit like aroma. As the beer warms there is perhaps a hint of acetone, and a suggestion of spicy acetic acid.

Bitingly sour up front (puckeringly so), though not really in hard-Lambic territory. The middle has a full, rounded, slightly astringent oak woodiness to it and the finish has a phenolic, funky, musky and tart character to it. Up front there are lots of urea like flavors, perhaps a hint of acetic acidity that adds some spiciness and piquancy, but doesnt overwhelm the beer, and most dominantly, a biting lactic acidity. The middle and finish sees a supporting fruit character that has hints of apples, and perhaps some tart melon notes, but definitely some sour grapefruit notes (that is a touch more noticeable than it was in the aroma). This has the required body that a good Gueuze needs; it has way more texture than a beer this dry should have, with the lactic character contributing a slickness and the oak providing a tannic structure, but this beer is still quite quaffable. The combination of the oak and piquant acidity almost contributes a woody peppery character to this beer. The funkiness here is quite appreciated, and it plays a supporting role, though is quite noticeable if you pay a little attention; earthy, musty, definitely has an aged-sweat / animal-muskiness to it, lots of soft phenolics, just an ample Brettanomyces signature.

This is on the sour side of the Gueuzes that I have had recently, I wouldnt quite call it a hard-Lambic, but maybe my palate has adjusted. I really like the complexity that this beer has; in addition, the slight acetic edge doesnt detract from the beer, as it is just a suggestion at this point; anymore and it would be too much. Perhaps noot quite at the same level as the 2012 batches from Tilquin (damn close to this one) and Girardin, but it is handily better than the De Cam from the same year. In the end this is another fantastic Gueuze, that I really dont get to drink enough of.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Good carbonation, white head but immediately gone. Fully hazy orange-amber. Very outspoken horseblanket and citrus in the nose. Grapefruit peel, lactic acid, wet oak. Tart but not really sour. Great! Just a lactic-lemony rind around a full mouthfeel - hinting at impossible maltsweet. Aroma's of ""speculoos"", wood, tannine. Sharper finish. Refreshing, but not light bodied. Great as expected.

The head is easy forming but not impossible to keep under control. It lasts amazingingly well and sheets the glass beautifully. The aroma is not overly funky. I pick up more fresh fruit than horse blanket, but there's enough there to make me think of being outside while eating peaches and smelling the earthiness from my parent's garden on one side and a different type of earthiness from the horse pasture on the other. A little rotting wood (actually not a bad smell, it's omnipresent during any walk through the woods). The flavor is bright and very tart. There's juicy fruit gum backed by an apricot smoothie and organges - clementines maybe. The tartness makes this refreshing but at the same time slows you down while drinking. It's almost like it's forcing you to relax and enjoy it.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

377,"2003-01-26",1.1,"They made me drink it so I'm going to rate it.  I think its important for the truely complicated beer styles to have the opposition speak just to warn those who may not understand that this is really challanging to drink.  This stuff smells like old horse blankets.  I felt a painful pinching in my cheeks when I drank it (that I am re-living as I type this).  All I taste is sour.  Just insipid.  Pungent and the only ""fruity"" I get is grapefruit rinds off last year's compost pile.  It is palate killing evil.  And I try.  I am getting better and one day hope to see what you all get out of this style, but for now, be warned.  Try it if you must, but for God's sake, have a glass of water handy.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
377,"2003-01-20",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2003 Pours a sort of hazy orange/straw color with a white head.  The aroma is intense.  Cheese, hay, mold, must.  Insanely dry in the mouth.  Your whole throat puckers and tingles.  It starts like liquid hay and moves to tart fruit and must, mold, leather and barnyard.  Really nice, but borders on too much.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
377,"2003-01-05",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 4, 2005 Head is initially average sized, fizzy, white, mostly diminishing. Body
is hazy light amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is heavily yeasty (horseblanket, barnyard, leather, cobwebs, cheese), lightly hoppy
(grass, lemon), with notes of white grapes, cask wood, sour apple, olives, and all that is wild and funky. Flavor is moderately sweet, heavily acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, heavily
acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively to fizzy carbonation,
lightly astringent. Possibly the wildest gueuze still made today...loads and loads of horse/stable/cobwebs/etc. aroma, just overflowing with rough-and-tumble rustic yeasty charm.  Doesnt have the elegance and finesse of Girardin Black, but good grief what it makes up for in sheer balls-to-the-wall arrogance!  And ends up being virtually equivalent in rating for its over-the-top uniqueness.  This has always been the most distinctive and unusual gueuze for me, and this re-rate proves no different.  Monumental if you can handle a walk on the *really* WILD side. Draw-dropping balance in the mouth that makes it nearly impossible to stop drinking. I really need to pump up my cellar with this stuff, as it never disappoints.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
377,"2002-12-24",4.4,"Hardcore stinky lambic, very balsamic salad dressing flavour, very satisfying, up there for sure. Dickcheese? ecz? WTF? Beautiful, slightly tart, very fn refreshing. Complex. Thanks mum!","Copenhagen, DENMARK","duff"
377,"2002-12-21",4.2,"Rerate: 12/21/2002: Second and third helpings have revealed what a wonderful, consistently great gueze this is. Dry, sour, woody, hint of grape skins and cherry. Original: 8/04/2002: Definite wood flavor...it stands out. I like it. Almost orange in color, this is a very nice lambic. Body is nice...not as thin as some.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

377,"2002-12-01",3.6,"Very sour, pungent nose like old leaves. Let this breath a little. Hazy gold color and tight bubbles in the head. The taste is vinous and puckers the mouth. Sharp and bitter end. Definitely challenging but worth the effort to acquire a taste for it.","GERMANY","pivo"
377,"2002-11-22",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 20, 2004 very little head on this murky orange monster..filling the air with cheesy foot fungus among us..onslaught of sourness followed by some sweetness surrounded by sweat and barnyard toe cheese..pretty flat..not as good as the beersel gueuze I had last night but..oh well  Re-rate: Much better experience.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
377,"2002-11-07",4.6,"aroma of used cricket pads, mothballs and apple cider. but its bark is worse than its bite. tasted of hak sauerkraut, capers, tomato leaves and apple peel and a lot more. amazingly full and complex. just the thing for a late summers afternoon","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
377,"2002-11-04",4.2,"Chill hazed copper-gold appearance with an, at first, billowing, then thin off-white head. This is a very effervescent beer. Aromas that conjure up thoughts of hay, sawdust, horse manure and a damp and dark basement. Some hints of lemon mixed in to that melting pot of aromas as well. The first sip hits with a stong acidic feel and a nagging bitterness that tugs on the sides of ones tongue. Noticeable flavor of Granny Smith Apples as well. Rather tart finish as well. This is a wonderful beer for lovers of the lambic style though if you are looking to try a lambic for the first time you may want to look elsewhere first. Otherwise you may really be turned off by this truly unique style.","Medford, New Jersey, USA","jcalbi"

377,"2002-10-21",3.8,"2000 VERSION: Nice and musty for being so young!  Cheeses and seeds of some sort in the nose.  Earthy tastes with the sourness already finding its place in the mix.  Several more years in the cellar could prove this to be a giant among the other gueuzes.  A nice high score for such a young gueuze.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
377,"2002-09-20",4.0,"Ok, my first real gueuze.  Translucent body with an attractive maize color.  Fizzy white head, sticks around mostly.  Quite the olfactory experience.  Very woody, with tobacco notes, sweat, clover, and grapey acidity.  Also a bit musty / leathery, which reminds me of Orval.  I could really get into this farmhouse character that Im encountering more often.  Lightly sweet, then sour, although I expected more mouth puckering.  Strong oakiness, with light fruit.  The finish is sometimes is salty, sometimes bitter like a grapefruit rind.  Mouthfeel is lean, but somehow it coats my teeth and gums like maple syrup.  The dryness as it warms is really lovely.  Frankly, Im astounded.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
377,"2002-09-14",4.4,"right up there in gueuzeland with girardin. scary dickcheese smells, follwed by far less scary flavours that are really complex, really sour but smooth and fruity at the same time. really full and juicy in the mouth. beautifully offensive","Adelaide, AUSTRALIA","eczematic"
377,"2002-09-10",2.9,"I have been deflowered ... and I am not sure if I like it one bit.  My very first gueuze.  Everything Ive been reading is true.  Smelly feet, soured cheese, hay, ropiness, sour, acidic.  I am not ready, I think to embrace this style.  I am giving it a decent rating solely because it matches the criteria of everything I have read a gueuze is supposed to be.  Much like my unending distaste for fresh tomatoes, I expect that I will try this style once a year and hope someday to like it.","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Inveigler"
377,"2002-09-08",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 22, 2003 Extremely firm woody aroma alongside mushy canned peas, persimmon, gun powder, iron, ancient library, and mild floral tones.  Assertive carbonation.  Palate is bone-dry with a puckering edge.  Finishes peachish, astringent, and dry.  Flavors are very well matched with  the aroma.  My favorite of the Gueuze family.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
377,"2002-08-18",3.9,"I enjoyed this so much that I had to go get another bottle immediately.  It took me a moment to realize that I was smelling the homeland of this beer in it.  Like everyone else has said it has an aroma of wet hay and barns, but in an extremely good way.  The aroma definitely lets you know that it will be nice and sour.  the flavor is very busy, nice and acidic and sour with good fruitiness tied in with the wood that it was aged in.  light to medium body.  finishes long, dry and clean with just a bit of tartness left to make you remember the glory of this beer.","San Diego, California, USA","akinm"
377,"2002-08-07",3.8,"aroma of aged, runny cheese, barn; taste very sour, no sweetness, dry, extremely acetic - I wanted to finish it , but the heartburn wouldnt allow it.  A good beer, but not for me.","Fargo, North Dakota, USA","mikenodak"

377,"2002-06-17",4.5,"Brutally sour, even more so than Lindemans Cuvee Renee. Has a strong smell of stable, wet grass and horseshit.. it puts your mind right in the Belgian countryside.. As one recovers from the initial blast of sourness, you can feel the oak it was aged in, as well as sour green apples, plus a bunch of other strange, intriguing flavors. Head was massive but short-lived. Lace was consistent. A very classy gueuze, definitely one Ill have in my fridge often. And at 7 bucks for the big bottle, not a bad deal.","Virginia, USA","FlemishChar"
377,"2002-06-15",4.0,"CLear, bright yellowed golden. Minimal head and lace. Nose of grapes,champagne, barn,lemon and some subtle floral notes. Very bright tasting and bursting with sour apple, lemony-lime flavor, and hints of wood. The body is thin to medium and has a grainy feel and taste which is very enjoyable. Very rounded and refreshing.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
377,"2002-06-14",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 4, 2003 In a side-by-side tasteoff with Lindeman's Cuvee Rene, this beer lacked the complexity to come out on top, though it's still a fantastic gueuze.  The aroma is a bit odd and it reminds me of sour wine, toecheese and gym socks - truly funky!  In fact, try to hold your breath as you drink this one - you'll thank me.  As for the taste, it's clearly a quality brew from true artisans and should be drunk by someone mindful of the craft that goes into making this, otherwise all they'll notice is the sourness (which, of course, is supposed to be there!).  Not enough going on.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
