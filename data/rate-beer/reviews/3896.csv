3896,"2015-08-06",4.2,"Bottle via a friend who went to the quarterly release, thanks Larry! Pours an amazingly dark purple to black with a crazy pink head. De Garde continues to amaze me with the limited beers of theirs in terms of the presentation alone. Aroma is a jammy raspberry with slight corporate sweetness. Taste is a great vanilla raspberry pie with a moderate sour presence. The sour on this was not at all over the top but based on how much fruit there was this would have been upped a bit if the sourness was lowered and the fruit was allowed to dominate more. New Glarus VSB but more sour.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"

Nice tart pucker. It tastes a lot like the Purple version.
