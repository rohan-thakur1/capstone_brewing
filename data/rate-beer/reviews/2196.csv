2196,"2015-10-30",4.2,"Tasted blind: This is really an excellent festbier. Its cloudy orange amber w/ a foamy head. Its got a big floral hop nose. Its nice and bitter, dry and slightly fruity. Id say this is not perfectly style but its delicious so thats good enough for this guy.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
2196,"2015-10-05",3.2,"In a flight at Hackneys Printers Row. Crackery, toasty malt. A bit earthy. Herbal dry finish. Pretty dry for the style.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","scarletfire65"
2196,"2014-12-29",3.6,"Bottle. Pour is hazy dark amber/orange with a small white head. Aroma and flavor of pale malt, biscuit, slight citrus, spice, and rye bread. Finish is malty and spicy.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Dfonorow"
2196,"2014-11-20",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
Bright herbal hops and biscuity cereals share the stage, as toastiness and bitterness slowly establish themselves on the palate. This is one fine lager, folks.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the shiny red.
-Hops possess the amazing ability to go beyond herbaceousness and explore oranges and cinnamon angles.
-Effervescence is soft, which leaves plenty of room for the delicate flavors to shine.
-Drinkability is very high, as the mouthfeel is crisp.
-This may be hoppier than your average German-made Festbier, but it works amazingly well here.

2196,"2014-11-17",3.6,"A reddish copper lager with a thick frothy mocha head. In aroma, crisp biscuit malt with herbaceous grassy hops, light lemony notes, light mineral notes, nice. In mouth, nice crisp fruity biscuit malt with grassy hops, light grapefruit, nice herbaceous character, well done. Bottle at Revolution Milwaukee location.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
2196,"2014-10-21",3.3,"Bottle, shared around the table at Revolution Brewpub. Compared to Revolutions Oktoberfest on tap, this had less malt impact and a drier finish. Still a nice fall dark lager, and kudos for cool label art.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
2196,"2014-09-30",3.4,"22oz bomber poured into a shaker. The aroma is a strong combination of dough, hay, and barnyard aromas with a light spice undertone. Theres also a notable grain quality with some orange zest late. A faint cat pee aroma looms in and out throughout the drink. It pours a slightly hazy amber orange with a frothy, soft, off-white head that leaves some puffy lace on the glass. A good, thick, puffy head is retained with puffy / chunky islands floating on its surface. The taste is a medium bitter with a medium light sweetness. The oily and sticky beer has a medium body with a light prickly carbonation. Theres noticeable bread toast and roasted grains on the mouth with some cereal qualities as well. It finishes with a grainy and grassy touch as well as a hint of orange peel - all of which have a mellow lingering in the aftertaste. Its slightly dry with a touch of astringency.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

2196,"2013-10-15",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2015 Howler from the brewery. I was sure it said something about it being a rye lager. It certainly seemed like it had that spicy rye taste and a reddish brown color. Slightly cloudy beer. Very good. Serving: Tap","Chicago, Illinois, USA","rubbishystuff"

2196,"2012-12-12",3.6,"5 ounce taster at the Half Acre tap room.  I normally dont like Oktoberfests, but this one pleased me. It was a rosy golden color, no head and no lacing.  Aroma was hops and malts.  Taste had a certain I dont know what...salami?  And I hadnt consumed salami prior to trying it, in case youre wondering.  Also in there was cereal, subdued grain, hops and a very mild dose of sweetness.  I liked the hop presence that balanced out the sweetness with some bitterness.  Medium bodied and minimal carbonation.  In all, a very nice lager from an ale-centric brewer.","Illinois, USA","brian60625"
2196,"2012-11-05",3.8,"Draft at Half Acre. Pours a deep near amber with an offwhite head. The nose is pretty clean. Spicy and grainy for sure, some herbal and grassy hops come through as well. A touch of sourdough in the nose as well. On tasting, crisp, medium-high bitterness. Robust rye note, grainy and fruity. Clean and earthy, pretty interesting overall and worth trying.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
2196,"2011-11-15",3.1,"This poured a somewhat hazy orange color with a beige head. Aroma was mainly light caramel and pale malt, light hops too. Flavor was nice blaance between grassy hops and semi sweet malt. A good example of the style.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerman6686"
2196,"2011-11-12",3.5,"tap at marias.     notes of rusty doughy earth, touch of carmalized sugar, walnuts, and some pleasant grassy bitterness for balance.  nice.","pouring bus, New Brunswick, CANADA","SrSilliGose"
2196,"2011-11-03",3.6,"Clean malt aromas with a hint of toast.  Maybe a touch of esters, but it could be my imagination.  The small head quickly recedes to the sidelines revealing a dark, burnt orange beer underneath.  Malt dominates for sure, but it has more hop character than I am used to for the style.  This one starts out sweet and cuddly but gradually matures to a dry and pleasing end like a relationship between two old friends.  A welcome change to some of the more cloying Oktoberfests from many American craft brewers.  Full bodied with moderate carbonation, this well balanced Oktoberfest is very comforting on a wet, cold day.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","GlassBrass440"
2196,"2011-10-31",3.5,"64 oz growler purchased at the brewery (Chicago, IL) on Saturday. Opened for Halloween. Pours a rich glowing copper hue, reddish orange glow and edges with touches of haze, crisp brownish darkness in parts. Big cakey tannish brown head cakes and laces well. Aromas are crisp toffee, toast, and biscuits. Munich malts, a touch of nuttiness, more dry toast, and floral and earthy hops with just a touch of spice. Initial is lighter end of medium bodied, offering biscuits and toast up front, bread, a touch of nuttiness moving into caramel and toffee sweetness touches dancing. Dry toast with some mellow sweetness, moving into a dry floral and earthy hop finish of a decent bitterness. Some faint spice, with good flavors and drinkability. Sufficient dryness with touches of sweetness dancing and giving it just a touch of body. Finish shows some more munich, dry and lightly sweet malts, decent hopping, touches of spicy bread yeast. Pretty nice fall drinker, smooth lager with good flavors yet a nice drinkability. Fresh, inviting. Pretty nice lager by the guys at Half Acre.. But its no Zucker! Gorgeous beer is gorgeous though.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2196,"2011-10-31",3.8,"Multiple pours during the Half Acre Saturday tour. Great session brew. Poured dark amber hue with a moderate off-white head that diminshed slowly with good lacing. Roasted sweet aroma. Medium body. Good well balanced flavor with a dry smooth long finish.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","hombrepalo"
2196,"2011-10-28",3.6,"64 oz. growler from the Half Acre tap room.  Pours a deep reddish orange with a medium eggshell colored head.  Aroma of caramel, nuts, some bready and crackery malts.   Flavor is bold for a marzen.  Nice and crisp.  Strong malty presence, and a fair amount of bitterness keeping the sweetness at bay.  Very full-bodied.  Finishes on a leafy-hop note.  This is a very nice Marzen.  Its definitely outside Half Acres comfort zone but they did a good job with it.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
