1223,"2011-10-14",3.2,"In short: A sweet sticky dark beer.  Good but nothing special.
How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed approximately 6 months after first bottle rating.  Bottle sent to me by Sherm1016, thanks a lot Todd
The look: Near black body topped by a very small dark beige head
In long: Nose is mostly liquorice, figs a bit of rubber and also some dark hard candies.  Taste is very straightforward, fruit cake with an extra of dates and figs, chalky yeast, soy sauce, caramel.  Very cake-like maltiness, a bit oily, a bit sticky.  This is a very sticky sweet beer, I know many doppelbocks are, but this one just didnt have the complexity and richness to match its sweetness.  I drank a full bottle but I was really happy to move to something else once the bottle was finished.  Also I like to pretend this beer was made in my honor.  Creepy, Creeper.

1223,"2011-04-21",3.8,"Bottle purchased at the brewery over Christmas and shared at a recent tasting. Served in a snifter.

Pours a dark chestnut brown with a pretty good tan head. After the initial pour, the head dies down somewhat quickly but leaves some nice lacing and eventually settles into a moderately-thick collar. The nose is really quite sweet straight from the start with some really nice notes of chocolate, dark fruits, and toffee. The taste follows along this path, though isnt quite as sweet or complex as the nose. Very smooth. Good light chocolate notes and a bit of caramelized dates. Medium body with good carbonation. A nice example of the style.

3.5 A: Pours black. About three fingers of creamy light brown head with below average retention and just a small ring of lacing.

3.5 S: Good amount of roastiness in this with semi-sweet chocolate making a big appearance as well. Some faint caramel, but overall fairly dry. Malts can be described as grainy, if anything. Grassy hoppiness Not bad, but needs some strength.

4.0 T: Unlike the nose, the taste is big and bold. Roasted malts, milk chocolate, medium roast coffee each exhibit plenty of force. Secondarily, there is a touch of smoke, some lactose-like sourishness, caramel, and dark fruits. Again, grassy hops. Pretty good, borderline 4.5.

4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Creamy, but could be more so and super smooth.

4.0 D: This is a pretty good beer and is basically an imperial stout brewed with lager yeast. Good taste, no off-flavors, and highly drinkable.

Malty, sweet, and doppelbock-like flavors with nice sweet, nutty characteristics...very malty beer but hides the alcohol quite well, at least a lot better than the nose led on...though it kind of presents itself in the very late finish/aftertaste where the nutty bitterness and alcohol are all thats left.  Lots of nutty brittle flavors though...and a punch of two of some malty sweetness.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"

Some roasty elements to the aroma.  Flavor is similar with some strong flavors of malt, dark fruits and maybe even a twinge of smoke.

Graham crackers, fudge and dark chocolate. A sticky and cloying body with the tart taking a backseat. Such a pleasant drink! Absolutely perfect seasonal drinking with its crisp body and smooth flavors. It has both a chill and a warming tingling effervescence. As it warms, the raisins and chocolate flaovrs become more apparent. Theres a nice nuttiness and maple sugar sweetness that is off set by the bitter citrus and mild smokiness. Nice and toasty.

Full and roasty, full bodied for a lager and nice fruit notes. Pretty awesome beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"

Rich malty nose, heavy roast, chocolate, toffee, bread, and ample dark fruity esters.  Full chewy body with a slippery mouth feel and ample carbonation.  Flavor wise, this beer as with most FFF beers suffers from a major identity crisis but in a very good way.  Theres enough roast and coffee notes that blind I would probably call this a stout but I still get that ripe dark fruit presence that I get from Doppelbocks, actually, blind I would probably think this was a European stout.  Interesting beer a kind of roasted, chocolaty, Doppelbock.","Tampa, Florida, USA","HOPSHUNTER"

This brew is indeed hard to describe - to me it feels like one part stout, one part doppelbock with a heavier stout element comparatively. Aroma is indeed doppelbock - reminds me of the andechser actually - a certain sweetness that is hard to describe. Mouthfeel is a little chewy - flavors are bittersweet, almost tangy german elements combined with stout characters of oatmeal and perhaps a little chocolate. Finishes a little bitter, and the abv seems to be masked fairly well.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
