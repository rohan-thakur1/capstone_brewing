2067,"2015-08-31",3.5,"Draft at the brewery, served in a flight. Pours a hazy gold color with a moderate white head that settles into a ring and film while lacing the glass. Notes of wood chips, toasted sugar, lemon peel, coriander, barnyard and cobweb sort of dusty dry funk, and what must be grains of paradise - sort of a light peppery spice. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a dry mouthfeel. Interesting beer. Has a chance to become really interesting with a brett treatment; I could see some layers of complexity developing there.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
