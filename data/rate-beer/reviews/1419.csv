1419,"2017-01-11",4.1,"Can from PhillyCraft. Thanks Vin! It pours a lightly hazed deep orange/amber color with a frothy, off white head. The aroma has lots of toasted malt with hints of berries and pineapple. Very light hints of caramel and dank. The flavor is rich and toasted with some pineapple, light currants, hints of nuts and toast. It has a nice bitter earthy/dank finish. Lots of flavor packed into this one, though well balanced. Soft mouth feel. This kind of reminds me of some of the old school 3 Floyds beers from back in the day. Killer stuff.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
