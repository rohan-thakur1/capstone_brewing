2488,"2017-06-12",3.5,"Pours a light yellow golden straw color with two finger of fluffy white foam. Nose is fresh wheat, soft citrus, lemon peel and a trace of floral fieldgrass. Palate follows with focused grain, bitter citrus pith, dusty funk and a refreshingly aggressive carbonation. Kind of taste like Florence parti-gyle. Easy drinker.","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"

2488,"2017-04-28",3.7,"750 ml bottle to snifter (bottled 09/29/2016 and shared with the Mrs.). Looks good for the style; a hazy lemon with fluffy fizzy white head. Smells solid; a nice mild blend of citrus, yeast, and funk. Tastes like it smells, but more citrusy, with a pleasant medium light-bodied mouthfeel thats mildly tart and acidic from the citrus presence. A great example of the style.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"

2488,"2017-04-26",3.7,"750ml bottle purchased at Hill Farmstead. Pours bright yellow, slight haze with a big frothy white head leaving big lacing. Smells sweet citrus, some oak, fresh lemon zest and a little yeasty. Tastes of sweet bitter lemon. Some oak and yeasty bacteria. Very light and crisp. A slight harsh bitter finish to it. Tart and sour vinegar on the back of the mouth. Light mouthfeel. Lasting aftertaste. Good but not great. Im a little disappointed by this one. I expected more.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Sudz4Dayz"
2488,"2017-04-17",3.9,"My Bottom Line:
Citrusy and quenching, this light Saison focuses on its acidity and dryness to offer a summer-y experience.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slim veil of foam clings to the misty yellowish white.
-Carbonation is soft and prickly.
-Flavor profile has the usual white grape and citrus fruitiness from HF Saisons.
-This is not far from a Berliner Weisse either with its delicate lactic tartness.

2488,"2017-04-15",3.6,"750 ml Bottle, batch 2. The aroma is lemons, dusty yeast, hint of Bactria. Light body. Lemonaide mixed with musty yeast. Has a certain peppery hint in the finish.

2488,"2017-03-25",3.9,"Got in a BIF from Roguer. 750 ml bottle into signature tulip glass, bottled on 9/29/2016. Pours hazy pale golden/straw color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of lightly tart lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange peel, pear, apple, peppercorn, hay, straw, floral, grass, wheat, cracker, white bread, light musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Nice and pleasant aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, grapefruit juice/zest, and light-moderate pale malt notes; with solid strength. Taste of big lightly tart lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange peel, pear, apple, peppercorn, hay, straw, floral, grass, wheat, cracker, white bread, light musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Light-moderate yeast spiciness; light tangy wheat and grapefruit tartness on the finish. Lingering notes of lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange peel, pear, apple, peppercorn, hay, straw, floral, grass, wheat, cracker, white bread, light musty funk, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Very nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, grapefruit juice/zest, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/tart/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from yeast spiciness and carbonation, increasing through the glass. Medium-high carbonation and light-medium body; with a very smooth, fairly crisp/grainy, and slightly acidic/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is nice. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 3.2%. Overall this is a very nice fruited session saison. All around nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, grapefruit juice/zest, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink. This doesnt really do proper justice to the radler style, as there isnt enough grapefruit tartness/acidity; but it was still very enjoyable as a saison.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

2488,"2017-01-31",3.6,"Bottle... Pours hazy and light yellow with a small, frothy, white head thats gone faster than you can say quick. The aroma features loads of citrus fruit  mostly grapefruit and tangerine  accompanied by low levels of citric acid and breadiness. Also, lightly peppery hops play along nicely with the wheats graininess and breadiness. Light-bodied with airy carbonation. The flavor is both citric and citrusy with enough yeasty and hoppy bitterness to totally balance things out. Crisp, lightly tart, watery finish.

2488,"2016-01-08",4.1,"A beautiful, funky, tiny beer. Theres a lot of complex aromas and flavors in this, which is particularly surprising given the extremely low ABV. Barnyard funk and citrus flavors mixed with oak are the initial impressions, and the flavor is more of the same. The addition of lactose gives it a unique full mouthfeel that you really dont expect in this kind of beer. Ive heard other people describe it as gushing; it was opened behind the bar for me so I didnt get a chance to see, but it did take about 2 minutes to pour after opening and had a huge head, so I wouldnt be surprised if it had gushed.

2488,"2015-12-10",3.4,"À Hill Farmstead. Mega gusher à louverture. Le liquide qui mest délicatement servi est jaune paille, mousseux, mais tel un feu de paille, cette mousse qui paraissais généreuse lors du service sestompe plutôt rapidement pour se réduire en un simple tapis blanc. Nez frais de pelures de citrons et dune acidité propre aux style farmstead. Jolie présence de levures sauvages, mais manque de complexité et de profondeur en général. En bouche le liquide est plus que léger. Dabord cette pétillance démesurée à la manière dun vin mousseux. Les saveurs sont malheureusement atténuées et obstruées par cette tempête bouillonnante. Lécorce de citron parvient à se frayer un chemin, mais les autres saveurs, funky et houblonnées, tombent un peu à plat malgré des efforts évidents de leur part. Pas mauvaise, mais loin dêtre très bonne.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

Great fruity nose and mouth, great dry finish that makes it want more and more. Even though this is quite lactic and tart, its really eaay to drink. Not watery at all even though its low abv.

2488,"2015-11-28",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2016 375ML Bottle at Hill Farmstead. I think on-site pricing is $16.50 but the beer will be sold to-go at some point. Split 2 ways.

A - This beer is incredibly aggressive. HF Staff did a great job of popping the cap and pouring the beer immediately. Basically poured as all foam and then finally turned into this milky yellow color with lots of haze and a 5 finger fluffy white head. If you end up getting a bottle, expect it to gush. 

S - Smells like a lemon and lime juice Berliner with cheeee and sourdough bread. 

T - Lime and lemon with pineapple and kiwi taste. Insanely light and juicy. You can drink this so easily dry mouthfeel with table sugar finish. 

M - Great mouthfeel. Sparkling water, Creamy with a lot of juiciness. Has an Orangina type of mouthfeel.

O - I think if I had a magnum of this, I could just chug the magnum, feel nothing and not have to pace myself. I drank my bottle pretty much instantly even while trying to be careful and savor it. Its a fantastic beer but at 3.2%, more akin to fruit juice. 

Update. Modifying my rating from a 4.2 to a 3.5. Batch 1 of this was a 375 and it appears theres a second batch in 750ML bottles released last week at Hill Farmstead. I first had a 375ML bottle on-site the end of November 2015. August of 2015, took a few to go. No tartness, little lime juice, very wheat heavy mouthfeel is thin and bland. No clue what happened to this beer.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
