746,"2017-06-09",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 10, 2017 Bottle from Alko, Helsinki. Pours hazy amber with a medium-sized white head. The aroma features citrusy and tropical fruitiness, berries and pronounced spiciness; seems high on hops and yeast. Taste is light to medium sweet and light bitter; hoppy flavours are strong with chacteristically Sorach Ace-like elements like berries prominent with floral hoppiness and a touch spiciness. Rich set of flavours, also some crispness adding bite. Strong fruitiness includes tropical fruits such as mango and peach. The palate is medium to full bodied and smooth in texture. Nice surprise: original but still very balanced.","Helsinki, FINLAND","Marstonlad"

The Sorachi Ace hops are quite powerful in the aroma and there is also a slight earthy/oaky character. Im assuming this is from the hops as well. Pretty intersting.

The flavor has a lot more complexity than I was expecting. That same dank/citrus hop note along with a stronger note of oak and vanilla; almost like this was wood aged. Not clean at all like a pilsner but more like an aged ale. Moderate bitterness and a pretty clean finish.

Overall, this is a very intersting beer. The wood/vanilla notes are unique and I love Sorachi Ace hops. A different, but well put together beer.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

746,"2013-07-27",4.5,"550 ml bottle bought at The Bottle Shop in Sai Kung.
Look: Translucent golden honey orange colour with flaky yeast sediments; Half finger head and white foam which lasts about 20 seconds; Small sticky lacing with small fizzy carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and fruity, which can be smelt a feet away, inc. light fresh grapefruit, lemon, pineapple, jackfruit, light floral, light honey, and light malt.

Taste: Nice light sweet taste of mid to light malt, with strong dill, light grapefruit, light bread, citrus / lime and creeping grass.

Body: Medium body, quite thick and rich palate.

Mouth Feel: Slightly resembles Fullers English Strong Ales, with low key, light but tasty lager malt and some bready character. Like it already! Sorachi Ace also contributes expressive herbal dill, and some good low grapefruit in a soft carbonated, very relaxing feel. 

Hoppiness: Sorachi Ace works like a T - damn refreshing and fleshy grapefruit plus assorted tropical fruits for nose, nice herbal dill, low-key grapefruit and moderate citrus for taste, and a slowly creeping bitterness which becomes prominent with further sips and ends with nice grassy finish.

After Taste: Slightly dry, very easy and refreshing to mouth.

Comments: This one has all the feel of a typically good Fullers ESAs, but it has all the nice features as advertised: Kaneko Golden malt is uniquely low key and tasty, and the Sorachi Aces fruitiness nose and nice dill taste is clearly expressed here. If anyone thinks Strong Pale / IPL are just crappy Euro macros, have a taste of this and youll find there are indeed greener pastures out there. Highly recommended!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

746,"2012-07-22",4.0,"Veiled golden pour topped by a creamy and sticky white head. It makes for an attractive appearance. On the nose, a herbal (sage, dill?), tea-like hop character with a zesty lemon connotation that is both forward and well integrated to the ensemble. Entering the mouth, a fairly simple, yet impressive malt impression hits the palate, akin to the best 100% pils malt lagers or pure Marris Otter English ales. That special Japan barley, whether Im swallowed by marketing or genuinely touched, impresses me with its delicate tannic qualities, pure barley flavours and soft cerealic chewiness. Hay-like and raw cookie dough impressions accompany this stunner nicely as this lager shows bready flavours that remind of high-fermented Belgian yeast strains. Good dosage between sugars and dryness permits a creamy, unagressive carbonation full of soft large bubbles. The hop are never stealing the show here, just adding the required refreshment in that mountain of barley. Thats a neat beer, never feeling as strong as 6.5% with very well extracted flavours that never try to reach extremes.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

746,"2012-05-09",3.8,"Draught at Izakaya, Dublin. Hazy golden pour with thin white head. Aroma full of lemongrass, lemon peel, fresh herbs,very light and sweet biscuity malt. Taste is full of the Sorachi Ace hop flavours - that zingy, herby lemon note is unmistakable; a tasty light biscuity malt profile really does let the hop do its work, and a Belgian-like yeast complexity comes through near the finish, ending with a satisfyingly bitter, but very dry, citrus bite.

746,"2012-01-25",3.0,"An interesting style, bottom fermented lager that focuses on traditional native ingredients. The nose comes up with a little brettonemyces and damp beaver pelt that conjours visions of grassy native wildlands. This folows through with cherry bottle caps (candy), and sweet sweat in the background, hiding like an asp on snake wacking day. The palate is linear with the structure and really highlights the Sorachi Ace hops, with lemongrass, powdered sugar and coriander. The Nipponia finished a little short and flat which is a shame, though this may be more on the age of the product than a technical fault of the batch.

Nose is insane: zesty orange, melon, pineapple, ultra bright and juicy with no muting sweetness, wood and pepper, high attenuation but bit of sweetness in soft pale grains. Flavor a bit letdown by comparison, not as bright as tipopills or husky as braumeister. Bit doughy, sorachi brightness accented by minor effervescent low-bubbled carbonation, quite oily actually. Flavor gains some grain and bitterness in finish, nice contrast with softly peppery here qualities, very complex and incredibly lasting.

746,"2011-10-26",4.4,"Tap at Churchkey. Rich golden color with relatively good head retention. I honestly dont remember the appearance that much because of the incredible aroma and taste that followed. I blacked out. The aroma is like the best spring bouquet of flowers. My notes say something along the lines of ""if you give this to a girl she will  have your baby."" Its just a delicious pinapple, coconut, floral explosion of awesome. Seriously. The taste does justice to the aroma. Very similar with that pinapple, floral, coconut in there, but with an added hoppy bitterness that ensures the beer is not too sweet. Excellent. Palate is a bit oily and again, that oily hoppy bitterness is what balances the beer. This is a gem.","Oceanside, California, USA","biggirlpanties"
746,"2011-10-26",4.4,"Tap at Churchkey. The pour is a clear orange with a small, white head. Thin, white layer sticks around for a moment. Pretty unassuming pour. Nose....uhh what is this? Big mango explosion with pineapple, coconut, and mandarin orange. Very rich and meaty fruits like jackfruit and mango flesh. As it warms it moves to nectar, honey, floral bouquet that is really something to cherish. Taste is extremely oily and rich...has a silky near butterscotch palate where you are really looking for diacetyl but there is none to be found. Rather it is ultra quenching and perfect in the palate like coconut oil cut by mandarin orange acidity. Almost faux oily richness. Really a superlative palate. I have a ton of notes here just trying to spit off the things that come to mind: mint, Spring day, nectar oil. This is incredible.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

The nose is absolutely gorgeous; notes of nectar fruit including mango, pineapple, and melon abound, along with light herbal and grassy hops.

746,"2011-10-05",4.0,"Draft at Redlight Redlight. No more than a couple weeks in the States, at most.  The pour yields a beautiful milky-golden body strewn with effervescing, champagne-like bubbles.  An off-white eggshell head sits squat at the surface, dense, smooth, and foamy.  Slowly subsiding to a thin film, the head leaves a thick ring of micro-mesh lace all over the glass.  The nose is gorgeous, showing a very lightly toasted, ultra-clean bread malt base, peppered with bright floral hops, clean grasses, and slightly twangy lager yeast.  A kiss of blonde honey provides some additional sweetness. Flavors follow suit, coming across fresh, clean, hoppy, and bready.  Light grain meets softly sweet bread dough, crisp grass, and mild citrus. Yeast plays a huge role, as it does in all top lagers. In this instance, it is creamy and doughy, zippy and peppery. The palate is substantive, layered with ample sugars, yet it is delicately aerated with lively bubbles, making it entirely quaffable. Damn fine stuff here. Miles better than the ale yeast version.

It is a bit astringent with some herbal and floral touches - I cant tell exactly what is in here, but it all adds up to a tasty and complex beer.
