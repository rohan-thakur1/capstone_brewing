4054,"2015-12-12",4.1,"On tap at the brewery. Pours a hazed glowing gold with a medium sized white head. Citrus and fresh green apple peel, soft hay. Medium bodied, delicate citrus, with some fleshy melon and a hint of butternut squash sweetness. Finishes with some lingering fruit and a bit of sweetness, juicy melon, watermelon rind, and hay. Easy, clean, beautiful. Gorgeous.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

Flavor has more prominent melons, watermelon in particular. Light sweet, light bitter, juicy, a bit vegetal, lots of melon. Medium body.

4054,"2014-08-31",4.1,"Served on-tap at the pub.


A - Pours hazy yellow with a nice creamy one finger tall white head, slowly dissipating down to a thin film, leaving sticky rings of lace on the sides of the glass.


S - Smells of strong fresh cut grass, tropical fruit zest, pine resin and some bready oats.


T - Starts off with the strong fresh grass and pine resin hops quickly being joined by the fruity zest, chewy oats and a touch of sweetness. Finish is quite dry from the hop bitterness, lingering long after the finish.


M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, bitter feel as most Tired Hands IPAs are.


O - A very nice fresh hop IPA. It has all of the flavors I look for in an IPA and the smooth feel makes it very easy to consume.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

4054,"2013-08-19",4.0,"On tap at Tired Hands. Hazy orange with a persistent white head. Nose is grass, honey, citrus peel and pineapple. Creamy medium body with a lingering buzz. Taste is grass, grapefruit, pine and big watermelon; i wasnt expecting that. The fruity sweetness subsides getting bitter and bready. Best watermelon brew ive had even if it has no watermelon.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"

4054,"2013-08-18",4.4,"Pours a hazy yellow/orange with a medium white head. Aroma is loaded with fresh melony hops and a touch of that tired hands rindyness. Flavor follows suit...really showcases that melon note. Mouthfeel is light and the finish stays with the rind and melon and a touch of grass...awesome beer!","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"
4054,"2013-08-18",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 20, 2013 On tap at the brewpub, pours hazy golden, tiny bubbled medium head, awesome lacing. Notes of dry and bitter fresh hops, watermelon sour patch slices, watermelon jolly rancher, juicy hop, cantaloupe, grapefruit and tang. So much watermelon candy in this sessionable pale. Re-rate: Went back a couple days later before this beauty kicked. Cant get over how dead on the watermelon flavor is. Incredible","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
4054,"2013-08-18",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2013 Clear golden orange body, medium sized white head, spotty lacing. Wet hops are driving a melon-forward profile with some citrus, grass and floral notes.
