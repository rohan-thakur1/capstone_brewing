4583,"2013-08-28",3.6,"$10.49/750mL, no date from Olive Tree Market in OB a week ago. Happy to see a new Upright beer, not happy at the price. My label states 4.5% ABV.

4583,"2013-07-11",3.3,"Pours a pale shade of yellow. Quite cloudy. The head is big and fizzy. It dissipates pretty quickly, despite its aggressive beginnings. No lacing. The aroma is light and lemony. Theres a bit of coriander and some wheat, but its quite mild. The beer is very dry, and Im only picking up light spicing in the taste. Lemons, peppercorn, mild wheat spice. Theres a touch of malt sweetness to it, but its largely lacking in grain flavor. Orange peel is probably in there. Light, grassy hops. Mouthfeel is effervescent. Carbonation is pretty high. Very light on the palate. Quite crisp. I appreciate the thought of doing a straightforward, low abv witbier, but this beer just lacks the fresh grain flavors and enticing spices of better versions of the style.

4583,"2012-04-18",3.4,"In short: A spicy witbier with a relatively strong tartness.  Above average for the style
How: Bottle 750ml.  Consumed approximately 2 months after purchase.  Bottle forwarded to me by mcberko, thanks a lot Matt
The look: Moderately cloudy blonde body topped by a short lived white head
In long: Nose is very wheaty with usual coriander, some orange peels and perfumed notes that fresh wild flowers.  Taste is again very wheaty and with a much stronger tartness than in most Belgian wits.  Also spiciness, mangos, coriander, doughy yeast, orange peels and flowers.  Also tiny bit of dusty attic giving the beer a subtle rustic character.  The body felt very light and the carbonation was a little too soft.  But I enjoyed the fun tartness and the flowers sensation.  A good witbier, but really not mindblowing.

4583,"2011-09-04",4.0,"This pours a clear golden color with a big fluffy white head.  The second pour was hazy as hell though, even trying to pour slowly leaving the yeast.  The aroma is lemon, wheat, yeast, barnyard funk, very light spice, hay.  Its very nice.  The flavors are light and fruity with a gentle palate cleansing tartness.  Fairly dry and a touch woody, almost a little like a white wine character.  No real funky flavors here where I thought that was presented in the aroma.  Its very refreshing and drinkable and the dry clean tart flavors really make me crave another sip.  There is some very light spice, showing as a little peppery.  But its easy to miss and I find I like it that way versus the over-spiced American Wits and Saisons where the spice notes are the main flavor.  This is a really nice light summer beer.

Yes, it has mostly the same ingredients: wheat, coriander and orange peel, but it is more fruity and tart. Upright has a way of twisting beer styles to make the brew more interesting.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
4583,"2011-06-09",3.8,"A solid pour produces a fat, two-finger thick, pale, off-white colored head.  The beer is a pale honey / straw color that shows a richly hazed, yellow straw color when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of earthy, slihglty grassy coriander, with touches of orange zest, dusty cracker like malt, freshly threshed pale grain (along with the dried straw like character).  There is a faint touch of tartness to the finish that is perhaps accentuated by the hints of orange zest.  I really like the slightly musty, expressive, sunny grain character that this beer has.  As my nose adjusts to it, there also seems to be a light tartness to this brew.

This has a zippy carbonation to it that pairs nicely with a nicely tart finish; it is much more tart than I was expecting & I am quite pleasantly surprised.  The tartness pairs nicely with the light orange zest flavor that is in the finish.  There some straw like pale grain character here as well as a touch of pale-wheat-cracker-like grain notes.  This is very light bodied and refreshing (the tartness helps with this last), but it also isnt overly thin or watery.  There is a touch of mustiness here, though not as much as in the nose, but overall the tartness coupled with the hay-like grain character makes this seem clean and refreshing.  There is an earthy, somewhat herbaceous, coriander character that forms a nice supporting backbone to the more prominent flavors already mentioned.

I am quite pleased that this is a Wit with some nice tartness to it; it is definitely the way I have come to prefer my Wits.  It has even got me a bit more excited about the tart Wit that I am just about ready to bottle up of my own.  This is eminently quaffable and a great Wit.  The more I get into this, the more I am enjoying this beer.  The fact that the tartness is pretty clean, is actually quite nice; there isnt any real funk here, which would actually overwhelm the flavors of this beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4583,"2010-05-05",3.6,"750ml, first bottled batch.  Pours a hazy, pale golden color with a tall but quickly collapsing head of pure white foam.  Tissue-thin, translucent sheets of lacing slowly break down to tiny, scattered spots.  The aroma shows bright, clean, creamy lemon chiffon, with a distinctly Belgian, lightly bready yeast profile. Coriander is present, but is thankfully kept at bay, while lemon peel proves bold and a hint of flaked oats shine through.  Flavors are spot on, again showing a clean, lightly sweet, fresh grain malt base. Candied lemon peel offers a crisp acidity to balance out the malt.  Theres a dash of slightly peppery, floral hops, with a dry, almost flakey yeast profile.  The palate, while far from full, picks up a bit of substance from what seems like oats or some other grain.  Moderate to lively carbonation is apprpriate for the style.  Wits dont often impress, but this one does just that.  Nice effort.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"
