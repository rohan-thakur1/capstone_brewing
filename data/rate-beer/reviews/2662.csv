2662,"2017-04-22",4.0,"The aroma on this sucker exudes oak and candied figs, followed by a bit of cocoa, red fruit, and alcohol. 
Pours a muddy brown coffee color with a slight tan ring of a head.
Taste is initially quite hoppy, lots of fruit, oak tannins, candied figs, and finishes with a bit of alcoholic burn.
A bit cloying and alcoholic on the palate, but the slight sourness of the red fruit acts as a bit of a foil.
Yummy!","Kirkwood, Missouri, USA","xmarcnolanx"

Pale beige, bubbly, loose, quickly disappearing head, warm dark bronze colour with mahogany brown hue, hazy. Strong aroma of sour cherries, wet oak wood, sweet sherry, dried plum, wet leather, vanilla, horse steak. Sweet candied fig in the mouth paired with sour blackberry and indeed sour cherry tartness contrasting with the sweetness, dried meat-like umami accent, bit leathery, slick and rather viscous, full mouthfeel, thick toffeeish malt body with the meaty umami, sour fruits and residual sweetness all playing on top of it, quite a lot of brown rum-like alcohol in the end, long and dry but nothing too astringent, lingering fruit tartness and dryness of woody tannins.

The aged 2012 was the best experience by far, so this rating is based on that. Raspberry-ruby shade of red with a brown opaqueness towards the center; barely any head at all. Just a few stray bubbles. Aroma is a nice mix between classic Hair of the Dog Old Ale & a fruity barley wine. Sticky brown sugar, molasses, oak, black cherry, pungent bourbon, mild vinousness, a touch of oxidation, a little bit of smoke, & some robust earthiness. Nice berry flavor on the palate, too, with a large fruit presence that never seems too out of plate (i.e., never too sweet or too tart, given the style). Heavy black cherry, plum, dates, backed up with big notes of boozy wood, sticky toffee & caramel, syrupy molasses, leather, & a touch of vanilla. Heavy body, coats the entirety of your palate with each sip. The first bottle of 2012 was quite smoky, which was a nice element, but it overpowered the cherries a little. The aged bottle had a much more well integrated smoke character & was surprisingly the most cherry-heavy of all the bottles.

2662,"2014-07-01",4.1,"Bottle via trade. 2014 bottle. Pour is absolutely still. Aroma is a sweet, fruity, leathery, vinous, vanilla, and cherry symphony. No alcohol or off aromas noted. No head, deep, intriguing brown with red highlights and some alcohol legs on top. Taste is initially a sugary sweetness, likely due to residual sweetness and unfermented bottling sugars. After that the cherry and fruitiness takes over with some vanilla and a light booziness. Malt flavors are dried fruit, slightly leathery with an almost tobacco note. Finish is semi sweet and clean with very little alcohol noted. A truly delectable dessert beer. Reminiscent of a Utopias type of beer but with a more fruit forward component and no alcohol present until you feel the effects of it. Im not sure carbonation would enhance this beer much.

After maybe an hour out of the fridge this comes to cellar temperature and pours near black and relatively still into my tulip glass, with a small tan head. The bourbon is right forward in the aroma, along with syrupy cherry. Tobacco and raisins. Smoke and corkboard. Sherry and peat. Intriguing, if a bit in-your-face. But the flavor is very sweet. Robitussin-drenched chocolate cake. Raisins and sherry.  Just a hint of peat late. Palate is sticky and heavy. I had high expectations, and Im hugely let down. This is basically a mess.

The flavors are not only rich and intense, but also well-melded.  The aroma recalls Kuhnhenn Raspberry Truffle or whatever that beer was.

Rich and sweet feel. Low carbonation and big full feel. Big time dessert beer and just a slow sipper needed by a fireplace. Wonderful beer","AUSTRALIA","fletchfighters"

2662,"2013-12-20",4.2,"2011 bottle, purchased recently from the Wurst Place. Ive had the 2012 several times at HOTD, but never rated it because Ive always enjoyed it with my wife and never wanted to make the effort to take notes. Its her favorite HOTD beer by far, and one of mine as well, so it seems silly I havent rated it. Im starting with tonight, but I expect its one Ill come back to. Anyway, onto the beer talk ... 
Appearance: Pours dark mahogany meets ruby. The red qualities are really only seen around the edges. Completely still with no head whatsoever. Aroma: Adam + cherries + wood. Dont mean to be flippant, but -- leather, dark cherries, vanilla, chocolate, roast, tobacco, smoke, wood. Really beautiful aroma. Palate: completely flat, but this still works. My wife commented ""its like drinking a viscous, delicious wine,"" and I agree. Full body, silky, viscous texture, long finish. Taste: Sweet cherries (+ rest of the notes from aroma -- they come in waves) with just the tiniest amount of bitterness at the end to draw it to a close and bring it together excellently instead of turning out like complex cough syrup. Overall: Damn, I love this beer. Even completely flat I love this beer. Permanently ISO cherry adam.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"

S: Great mix of smells on the nose. You can pick out the leathery and sweet malts from the Adam, the bourbon barrel with some oak, bourbon and a light caramel note, and finally the sweetness and fruitiness from the cherries.

T: The taste is even better. Cherry sweetness up front with some smooth oak and bourbon with a nice twinge of leather. Notes of vanilla and sherry with a heavy, bready malt note reminiscent of regular Adam.

M: Medium bodied trending towards the heavier side with a sticky and oily mouthfeel. Medium low carbonation with sweet and leathery finish.

O: Simply delicious. Everything works in perfect harmony and Adam as the base is the perfect vessel for the barrel aging and the cherry sweetness.

2662,"2013-02-13",4.2,"2012 Vintage
Aroma is full of rich malts with a pleasing cherry note throughout. Goose Island should take note - this cherry isn't at all medicinal. Lots of chocolate and light oak notes compliment. A light toast character with some pleasing oxidation notes. More oak as it warms. 
Pours a dark brown that isn't quite black with a thin tan head that quickly recedes to the edges. No lacing with medium sized legs. 
Flavor is very sweet with lots of chocolate and cherry. It tastes like melted chocolate covered tart cherries. Mid palate there is a nice roast character and some light oak notes. Light bitterness. The same oxidation that helps the aroma adds a slightly off putting finish. Light to moderate astringency. Some alcohol in the finish as it warns. 
Mouthfeel is full bodied with low but present carbonation. Astringency is moderate as is alcohol warmth. 
Overall this aroma is great but the finishing note in the flavor leaves a lot to be desired. I think I prefer these beers with a bit of age. The oak mellows as does the finishing note.

2662,"2012-09-08",4.2,"12oz. Bottle 2009 Vintage. Pours an almost black color with ruby shades and no head at all. Fantastic nose lets you know that this one is special. Soft bourbon aroma with the usual melted caramel and vanilla notes along with some faint cherry.  The taste is where this beer really shines. Subtle, layered and complex with bits of black cherry, molasses, vanilla beans and burnt candy sugar.  Sweet, but not cloying with an impressive depth and unbelievably smooth mouthfeel.  This beer floats on the palate without being thin or watery, just feels like a perfect combination of soft and decadent.  Carbonation is minimal which helps showcase the maltiness.  A touch of booze still comes through on the back end, but gives it a warming feel and is not at all distracting.  Really an impressive beer, although the cherries popped more when the beer was a little younger.  A definite winner!","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"

2662,"2012-08-12",2.9,"Appearance: Pours out a very dark brown body (though some reddish hints at the far edges) with a few bubbles that never quite form a head.

Smell: Earthy-scented, oxidized, and boozy are my main impressions joined by empty, lacking notes of spiced, brown sugar mixed cherries and soiled, more-than-musty wood.

Taste: Starts sweet, then traipses off towards a muddied earthiness, a dash of soy atop crushed sourish, tangy black cherries, and some solvent alcoholic heat. Oxidized malts. Rank wood. Modest phenolic smokiness. Near-flat, sweet, cherryish finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Very little carbonation present.

Overall: Im sorely disappointed here. I was really expecting quite a bit more, instead, its muddled, lacking, and rather non-cohesive.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

The beer is a dark ruby hue with minimal head and fair lacing. The aroma is fantastic, with scents of cherries, booze, tobacco, brown sugar. Fabulous. The taste is quite wonderful as well. Sweet, but not overly so. Alcohol content is impressively well hidden. Delicious. Would be easy to drink in large quantities. Terrific beer. Highly recommended.

The beer pours a dark brown color, with an obvious cherry tint and an actual cherry glow, although there is no head whatsoever. 

The aroma is full of strong sweet cherry, some plum, fig, and raisin as well. Some general tart sweetness and a bit of tart cherry in the background.

A bit of toffee and caramel malt go along with sweet cherries and a bit of molasses up front. Nicely blended dark fruits - plums, figs, raisins, and red grapes all blend together well. The finish is a soft caramel malt sweetness. The flavor could have been finished off better.

The mouthfeel is is the downfall of this beer. No carbonation really causes the flavors to stick together and clump on the tongue. It feels heavier than it should. Sticky.

Pours a dark ruby brown hue, almost opaque with a touch of reddish brown glow on the edges. No real carbonation whatsoever, as some loose bubbles die to a nonexistent head. Aromas are quite rich, offering loads of toffee and oak, vanilla, spice. Caramel, biscuits, touches of toast, dark fruit offering of raisins and black cherries. More oak, a waft of heat, and more oak, gentle spirit. Fairly sweet slanted. Initial is fuller bodied, offering slick sticky malts up front, biscuits and caramel, toast, bread, gentle oak and vanilla tannins, moving into a middle of decadent black cherries, touches of dark fruit plum and raisin. More vanilla, oak, sweet sticky malts and a gentle yeasty spice. The cherry and dark fruit element grows, fairly strong though not medicinal. Some dry cocoa and vinous qualities as it warms more. Fairly complex as it goes. Some powerful flavors, gentle barrel flavor grows into the back as it finishes and warms a bit more. A touch buttery and quite oaky, lots of cherry, touch of dryness, heat, and spice linger on the finish. Not bad, a touch nutty, sticky yet silky. Pretty pleasant, lack of carbonation causes a lesser experience due to low mouthfeel. A bit dissappointed in this, but the problems seem to spawn from the carbonation issues.. Not the beer itself. Still a pretty solid beer despite the issue, but I can imagine some carbonation boosting this bad boy several points.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

2662,"2011-11-29",3.9,"In short: An oaky tart and tannic dark ale full of dark cherries.  Very good
How: Bottle 12oz.  Vintage 2008 (aged in Bourbon + Sherry barrels) + 2009 (aged in Elijah Craig Bourbon barrels).  Consumed when almost 3 years and 2 years of age.  2008 vintage sent to me by after4ever and 2009 vintage sent to me by brewolf, thanks a lot guys!
The look: Dark burgundy body topped by a beige ring of foam
In long, 2008 vintage - (8-3-8-2-16) (3.9): Nose has lots of dried dark fruits, a slice of raisin pie, a strong oak barrels presence.  The blend of bourbon and sherry barrels worked well on this vintage and the beer did smell like yet another bourbon barrel aged beer.  It was very oaky, no doubt, but I would not have guessed what type of barrels, I could have believed wine barrels.  Taste has more dark cherries than expected (a whole lot of it actually) with also raisins, sherry, oak barrels, pie crust, tobacco, earth, chocolate cake, woody red wine, medium tannins presence.  A bit tart and very astringent in the finish.  Full viscous body with minimal carbonation.  Hard to believe that this is a 13%+ beer.  I can only imagine how great this beer could be with a proper carbonation.
In long, 2009 vintage - (7-3-7-2-13) (3.2): Less tart cherries, more sweetness apparent, less complex fruitiness, move straightforward bourbon barrels instead of vinous oak, as little carbonation as the 2008.  2008 wins easily.
In conclusion:  I dont think Ill give this beer another try considering it is pricey, hard to come by and some bottles can be so-so.  Maybe the 2008 is much better than the 2009 vintage, maybe I got a good 2008 bottle or a bad 2009 bottle, I dont know, it left me wondering if I am a lucky man or an unlucky man, like when my wife makes an extra effort to cook me a special dinner.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The beer pours a very dark brownish-red color with a tan head. The aroma is full of cherries and roasted malt, with a little bit of soy mixed in.

2662,"2011-09-10",2.8,"Almost no head remains on the coffee coloured lifeless pour. Toasty, well developes malts as usual from HOTD with powdery chocolate, gentle woodsy smoke and burnt sugar notions. Surprisingly roasty. The bourbon is not overpowering, but obviously contributes to the rather stale, digestive character with wanted oxidation albeit probably exagerated as this stage since the bottle has a good 2 years on it. Very warming and sweet even though the alcohol is not overwhelming. The cherries remain well integrated all throughout, peaking towards the finish where they seem soaked in alcohol. There seems to be little tartness to those cherries though. Weird beer, impeccable malt extraction and complexity. It seems roastier than Adam and more alcoholic (which it is) and sweet, that blend and the timid acidity making it far less drinkable and certainly less lively than its brother. Huge beer, fitting RBs general tastes, but that high a score is certainly surprising to me, especially as a man whos usually sold in advance to HOTD, but this time finding little beeriness/drinkability in there, so much that after a few sips, I felt like drinking something else.

Pours a dark cola brown with absolutely no head. In fact, one can locate and count a handful of straggling bubbles, but thats all. Ive had old ales that have been much more to look at than this one.

Port-like nose: sweet-dark fruit, chocolate and bourbon, some, but not much, dark cherries on the end. Hotter than I expected in the nose, but rich and appetizing. Sweet and nutty, some oakiness, and a good bit of heavy-on-the-vanilla bourbon. I only really pick up on the dark cherries on the finish, which are nice, but a little drowned out by the bourbon, in my opinion. 

We tried this next to Adam, and I was a bit taken aback by how much Adam is drowned out by the oak. The tobacco, earthiness, along with the smoke, is absent here, which is a bit disappointing. This is still a wonderful, viscous dessert-like beer, resplendent with caramelized dark fruitiness, but it lacks something (besides carbonation) in the finesse category. Still a fine beer.","North Carolina, USA","Verecund"

T: Very similar to the nose with the cherry a bit more muted and the sherry flavors really coming to the front.

Big body on soft carbonation... a dry woodiness comes into play mid-palate through the finish. Nice transition from sweet/chocolate notes in the front to bitter tight tannins in the back. A nice take on Adam that leaves the original character and adds some other nuances to make things interesting. Controlled and damn tasty.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"

Stellar aroma of spicey barley wine, bourbon, cherry, sweet malt, leather, muffled holiday spices - a symphonic aroma and among the very best Ive been fortunate to have under my nose.

Gorgeous fruit character presents itself anew with each sip. I do not get a lot of specifically cherry  notes, but the fruit character is quite nice.

2662,"2010-07-05",3.8,"12 oz bottle - 

Aroma - the wood dominated the nose and was quite an example to show someone what the effect of barrel aging has on beer.  Subtle cherry aroma, light toasted bread, molasses and toffee with some vanilla/whiskey really struggling to come out.

Appearance - beautiful cherrywood brownish/purple-red body with a scant 1/4"" off-white head.  

Tatste - the cherry/whiskey/wood combo was quite pleasing, the suprise of finding an actual cherry in the beer was kinda cool.  Alcohol was present, and it did kinda remind me of someone dumping a shot of whiskey into my beer, but it was still enjoyable.

Palate - smooth on the palate, slighty hot from the alcohol, carbonation with this was extremely low

12 oz. bottle; little to now carbonation with trace bubbles forming along the edge; bourbon, cherries, oak and chocolate on the nose; more of a fruity sweetness on the nose; drinks thin and flat with the lack of carbonation muting the depth of flavor and complexity; very sweet with much more bourbon; very little tartness and more of a candy cherry flavor; peat not as noticeable here either; more cherries and more rich bourbon, but I found the 08 much more enjoyable and complete; hopeful that this will carbonate and grow over time; now drinking next to batch 76 regular adam  obviously more rich and complex in terms of flavor profile and depth; Im digging the heavy bourbon here as opposed to the cherries

2662,"2010-04-09",4.1,"2008 bottle consumed 4/9/10.  Pours a deep brown practically black with barely any head.   Aroma of sherry, vanilla, some light bourbon, chocolate, smoke.   the sherry, oak, and vanilla mixture give the beer port-like nose.  Flavor is a soft, velvety bourbon, mouth warming booze, and chocolate covered cherries.  Carbonation is quite low.   


Not as smokey as regular adam and some of the dark fruit seems masked by the barrel notes.  Some of my favorite qualities of regular adam are the smoke and dark fruit, so this is somewhat disappointing.  The aging in the sherry and bourbon barrels, however, add a whole new dimension to this beer and really transform it into something completely different.  The booze in the beer is definitely not overwhelming and I dont believe it takes a way from the beer in a significant way, but if you have a bottle, Id recommend holding onto it for a bit longer.  Seems like this could benefit from a bit more time in the cellar.  Great beer though, would be curious to try the 2009.

The bourbon and cherries take a sophisticated, well balanced beer to the next level with smoothness, a touch of bourbon booziness, a bit more sweetness, a tang of black cherries, but all put together perfectly.  Ok, I am biased, I loved Cherry Coke when I was a kid. This is the adult, hyped up, supped up version that has none of the cloyingness or sickley sweetness.  I could drink this all night. Amazing. Amazing.","Tokyo, JAPAN","TimE"

A brownish, murky amber colour. Difficult to get any head on this, but a small, creamy, beige film head does appear. Aroma has loads of oak, viniousness, very light fruitiness, fat toasted caramel, very slight vanilla and more prominent sherry notes. Medium carbonation, small bubbles, impressive dry mouthfeel, just so incredibly velvety. Flavour has that Adam toasted caramel elegance, mixed wonderfully by near-perfect barrel-aging. Sherry sweetness, cherry tartness abound, dancing along my tastebuds, toasted, roasted, chocolate. The cherries are extremely subdued, but probably they are the ingredient that makes it all come together so amazingly well. Really impressive beer.

Flavor is a nice balance of sweet and tart, with underlying roasted malt flavors from regular Adam, as well as a complex dark fruit character, with tart black cherries, dried plums, red wine, and berries.  Vanilla, oak, sherry, and bourbon are all also in there.  Not too much booze, although it is definitely there.  It is interesting that this was aged in sherry barrels, since that is a flavor that is often considered a bad thing as it can denote oxidation.

Appears to be black, but closer inspection reveals it to be very dark brown with a dark ruby tint. Pours with a totally minimal head. No retention. Pretty good lacing, suprisingly.

Smells like Adam, only better. Nose is of huge cherry notes mixed with a bourbon-like backbone. Good oak presence. Big caramel malt notes. Lots of dark fruits mix with molasses notes. Hints of vanilla, smoke, dark chocolate and butterey biscuits. Very slight booziness. 
Quite a complex nose. It smells like dessert.

Taste is quite complex, also. Cherries and lots of other dark fruits, right out in front. Good bourbon notes mixed in. Lots of smoke, leather, and hints of oak. Dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel, molasses, and brown sugar. The sherry barrel aging comes through in the finish.

Mouthfeel is okay. This is a thick, viscous brew. The lack of any real carbonation hurts this one and leaves it overly syrupy.

The saddest part is that this is my only bottle of this. I wish that I had several others so that I could lay them down for awhile and see how they progress.
This is a beer with an amazing level of smells and flavors. The lack of carbonation really leaves it too syrupy, which costs it points.

Bottle:  The aroma has lots of bourbon and vanilla notes, along with light smoke, wood, and faint cherry.  It pours a dark brown with some red highlights when held to the light.  It has a small off-white head that quickly fades to a thin sing around the edges of the glass.  The flavor starts with dark fruits and chocolate.  The finish has light notes of bourbon, vanilla, and cherry.  Medium-full bodied with minimal carbonation and a slick mouthfeel.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

2662,"2009-06-23",4.1,"Bottle. My initial thought was that you cant improve upon Adam. I think that thought was validated by this beer. It has the depth and complexity to match anything in the style, but it doesnt match the subtle depth of the original brew. Nose is bourbon/oak and cherries, caramel, chocolate, mild leather. Deep amber-brown pour. Flavor is again dominated by oak and tart cherry, which is phenomenal but overwhelms the immense complexity of Adam. The oak seems to imply more alcohol than is present. Overall this is a wonderful beer but the overshadowing of its base detracts from the impression.","Austin, Texas, USA","slimchill"

2662,"2009-05-25",3.9,"Bottle thanks to miketd, an outright gift!Purple-brown, small beige head. Nose has a lot and is very coherent: cherry, chocolate, alcohol, and minor roast malt all set against the more vanilla-like bourbon and fruiter sherry, both of which bring a rich, weather-aged wood, like an old roller coaster. Unofortuntately, warmth brings a lot of alcohol to drown out some of the complexity. Warming notes of caramel, faint smoke, chocolate, and vaguely peaty bourbon dwarf the initial fruit flavor. Significant bourbon and cherry in the moderate finish, a little too much alcohol just like a young Adam and a little too thin. Still, this is built on Adam, and Adam is amazing, so its damn hard to go wrong. That this experience is due solely to Mikes generosity makes it even more enjoyable.

Bourbon-forward and not particularly well integrated, the flavor features the same notes found on the nose: wood, bourbon, cherry, dark fruit; pretty boozy.

2662,"2009-05-03",3.4,"Sampled March 2009
A careful, but solid pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip glass produces a frothy, half-finger thick, fairly quickly disappearing, lightly browned, dark tan colored head. The beer is quite dark, with a concentrated brown, approaching black color, when held up to the light beer shows some flashes of ruby, but is mostly opaque in its darkness. The aroma smells of spicy Bourbon, but has an earthy malt character to it that moves into a rich note in the finish that is a bit like prunes or perhaps even some sherry like notes. There is enough noticeable alcohol in the nose that it warms my nose upon a deep draught of the aroma. The malt character here is pretty complex, though in some ways subtle; toasted malt notes, spicy grain, a hint of salty smokiness, something a bit like carbonized fruit (though without the acrid notes, or even the burnt char character). There is some woody oak character here, as well as some spicy barrel character, soft vanillin notes and even a touch of toasted coconut; overall the barrel notes are pretty well integrated and dont overwhelm the rest of the aromatic notes. I definitely dont smell any cherry like notes here though.

This beer is lightly sweet, though it has more of a rich maltiness than actual sweetness. The beer finishes with a peat derived, salty, earthy smokiness that lingers on in the finish along with a sherryd prune character (prune without much sweetness though). This is only lightly carbonated; it has just a prickle of carbonation as it rolls across the tongue. The beer isnt overly viscous, though it certainly has some body to it, and it has a certain soft creamy texture to it. Behind the smokiness in the finish are some dark malt notes that suggest hints of tar, a bit of roasted coffee notes and a rich roasted caramel note (not burnt, but rich with lots of Maillard browning flavors). This definitely has a spiciness from the barrel aging process and the alcohol also provides a bit of heat. There is a touch of tartness to the finish; is this where the otherwise absent cherry character comes in?

I am not quite too sure about the cherry part of this beer, there is a general fruity richness, but certainly not anything I can identify as cherry specific. This could use a bit more texture and heft, a bit more residual malt character in the body would help to smooth out the warm / boozy alcohol and spicy barrel notes. Seems to lack a bit of finesse and the flavors / aromas are not quite as integrates as one might hope. Still this is certainly a tasty beer and I like how the background sherry notes add a lot of richness to this beer. The smoky peat character also adds a lot of background complexity to this beer.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2662,"2009-05-02",3.9,"12 oz bottle 2008 edition thanks to footbalm. I really anticipated this brew because the regular Adam is simply amazing. Pours a very dark brown color with a medium white and light pink head. The aroma is very complex; sweet nutty notes, fruit, woody bourbon, lots of wood and light cherries. The flavor is very interesting; bourbon, dark cherries, vanilla, the finish washes rich chocolate and caramel over your palate. Very distinct from Adam, but great in its own right. Nice and very complex.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
2662,"2009-05-01",3.6,"A gift from Tim, thanks a lot.  The pour makes the head just fuzzy, not real substance to it.  As expected it fades quickly and leads to a halo lacing. The head is tan colored with a pink hue to it.  Body is a dark cola brown color and also has a bit of a pink hue to it.  It is too dark to see through.  Aroma is very grainy, almost buckwheat-like (I like that), with plenty of alcohol to it and a cherry aspect. Flavor is more dominated by the cherry aspect and as a consequence makes the flavor seem thin.  This is conjunction with the extended barrel aging which thins it out as well. And as expected the alcohol is there as well.  The buckwheat aspect is last to come appear, which is a shame because that is my favorite part.  Its a bit too light bodied for such a strong beer.  I would like more heft to the body and less heat in general and I prefer the regular version so much more.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
2662,"2009-04-30",4.5,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a Delirium Tremens Snifter. 

Appearance - A semi-aggressive pour gives me close to no head, just a ring of large bubbles around the edge. This one is a very dark brown color. Has some lighter brownish red tinge around the top when viewed up against some light. Has some legs on it when swirled, very good looking brew.

Smell - Wow, you better be a cherry lover to like this smell. Right when I popped this one open I could smell the tart cherries creeping up into my nose. It smells awesome, much stronger than the Bells Cherry Stout I had last night. Smells like there might be some vanilla in there, is that bourbon? Some chocolate there as well. Wow, massive oaky smell after a swirl in the glass, very strong!

Taste - First sip is a good one. It is still too cold, so I will be letting this one sit for a little while, but first sip reveals a lot of the same in the smell. Very strong oak taste, cherries are a lot more subdued than I thought they would be (probably will be more pronounced after it warms up). I can definitely taste the smokiness of the original Adam in this one. The bourbon is starting to come out in full stride. This beer is almost stout-like in taste. Cherries actually become less and less noticeable as it warms up, a little disappointing for me. 

Mouthfeel - Great thickness too it. This is not too thick nor is it too thin. A lot like normal Adam but this one feels like there is a little more there. I almost expected it to be thicker by the legs this beer has, but nevertheless not at all disappointing. Very coating and just beautiful feeling.

Drinkability - First couple sips are easy to go down. This becomes a little less drinkable as it warms up. The bourbon almost becomes a little overbearing, nothing like GIBCS though. Still a great beer and definitely will be enjoying these through the years. Cant wait to see what it is like with some more years on it.","Salem, Oregon, USA","josephselander"

Oak, vanilla, and tart cherries round out the smells. The flavors are just as complex as dark chocolate and toasted caramel form the malt base. A lot of oak and vanilla show through with the roast and tart cherries adding a fruity character. The bourbon seems to tie everything together with great balance as it is not overdone at all.

Tons of medicinal cherry and bourbon and roast in the flavor.  Lots of bombastic elements.  Hugely sweet often in a wooden, spirit-like way.  No tannins, but some acerbic fruit character, similar to a stem-like quality.  Hot and messy most of the way through;  though it kind of cleans itself up somewhat as it gets some air, it doesnt really recover; massive roasts, sweet fruit, and thick alcohol, unequivocally competing and not not yet in harmony.

Flavor is the same, with regular Adam detectable under the oak and cherry and vanilla components.  The body is a little flat, this could use more carbonation.  Sweet though not sticky or cloying.  I find the regular Adam to be a more complex and nuanced beer.  While the cherry and wood create a nice new marriage of flavor I dont think it improves upon the original.  Though this is a nice change of pace and Im glad it was made.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

The mixture of bourbon, cherry, vanilla, and oak was very dynamic.  Killer nose on this.  The flavor was equally impressive.  Lots of sweet bourbon and oak arise, with the cherries coming through in the finish.  Really complex and interesting, I can sip on this puppy all the time.

2662,"2009-03-12",3.9,"Bottle courtesy of the generous Reino poured into a tulip.

Pours dark reddish brown out of the bottle before settling in almost completely black in the glass.  There is a small tan head on top that Im convinced has hints of purple in it.

The aroma is big and is an interesting mix of cherries, caramel malt, toffee, chocolate and booze.  Theres certainly a sweet woody character to the nose with lots molasses sweetness in the background to balance it out.

The taste does follow the nose pretty closely with a massive caramel malt base underpinning everything else.  There are sweet cherries, chocolate and dark fruit.  The finish has plenty of bourbon and is quite dry with a woody wine-like finish.

The mouthfeel is fairly full-bodied and very sticky sweet.  The wood imparts a bit of dryness that balances the massive sweetness.

Another great beer from HotD and while this doesnt quite stack up to the original Adam for me, the twists definitely make for a unique and tasty brew.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Aroma consisted of strong bourbon and fruit juice.  A lot of dark malt notes in the initial flavors with a big alcohol punch.  The cherries didnt show through until the finish as they were a sweet counterpart to the bitter alcohol.  Also a little bit of cocoa notes aided with masking the bitter bourbon-esq alcohol flavors.  As it warmed the flavors had become a little more like red wine.  An incredible beer.","Portland, Oregon, USA","boFNjackson"

What I have from my notes: Pours a deep brown color with a black center and mahogany edges. A light tan ring of carbonation coats the glass. Aroma is chocolate malts, earthy but restrained oak tones, and a sweet fruity element from the cherries. Smooth, easily-transitioned flavor of dark chocolate, tobacco, light leather and a sweet, mildly tart cherry finish. Both barrels lend a bit of character; I thought the Sherry was a bit more prominent. Very smooth on the palate. Overall, very good, but it will never stack up to the original Adam from the Wood.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"

What an amazing beer.
Pours dark ruby with a thinly disappearing mahogany head.
Aroma is just of pure enjoyment. Loaded with cherries and a strong bourbon and sherry that engulfs the nose with a good alcohol presence.
Taste is full flavor cherry and sherry barrels with some bourbon and faint vanilla.
There is a substantial amount of alcohol heat that covers the palate. Overly sweet with a very faint tart finish coupled with notes of malts/caramel.

2662,"2009-02-01",4.3,"12oz bottle, year made 2008--thanks to acrdz for the trade.  Let us see how one of my favorite aged beers does with bourbon and cherries.  A vigorous pour yields a tiny beige ring that faded to a about 12 even tinier bubbles--oh, and the body is a deep deep brown.  Bourbon, cherries, and raisins right up front--not GI BCS bourbony though, thankfully.  I like the interplay with the tangy cherries, sweet vanilla and bourbon, lightly sweet raisins, and then the dry wood and sweet molasses.  There is also some light salty smoked meats and tobacco as it warmed--theres the Adam I love!  Flavor had stronger tobacco and added leather notes--though not bretty leather--and the cherries dont really come through until towards the finish, and theyre a fair amount less tart than the aroma led on.  The bourbon in the flavor is more of a complement than a showcased characteristic, which makes me happy.  Some alcohol is noticeable in the dry finish, with bitterness peaking around a 2-3.  Full body smooth with almost no carbonation, which is probably my only complaint with this beer.  Either this is underrated (even at a solid 4), or Im just a sucker for anything Adam.  Would like to get more of this one.  AND--the cap was on correctly, which makes me want to add a couple points to the score, but then I realize that being a commercial brewery you shouldnt have crooked caps to begin with!","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

This gushed despite being properly chilled which is always a disappointment with expensive beers but I didnt lose much. It looks nice, dark black-brown, no head, red edges. It smells like wood, barrels, liquor, alcohol, very interesting. The flavor has a leather quality that I get from regular Adam, the slightest touch of tartness but I couldnt pinpoint it as a cherry flavor. This was pretty good but Im not sure Id pick this up again given the price and the fact that I just prefer Fred and Doggie Claws over Adam as a rule. I do have one bottle left to cellar so well see how that goes.

2662,"2009-01-19",4.5,"#1600.  12oz. bottle from the winter 2008 dock sale.  Pours absolutely pitch black at the center, with the faintest possible shimmer of mahogany at the far edge.  A large, foamy tan head settles slowly to a thin but solid layer, with a thick, bubbly gathering around the rim.  Sudsy lace breaks, mico-spots drying towards the top of the swirl, with the remainder of the wash slowly meandering back into the black abyss beneath.  In short, This stuff looks downright menacing.The aroma puts on quite a show.  Dark, syrupy chocolate and smoked cocoa nibs are first to greet the nose.  Darkly scorched caramel lends another layer, while heaps of earthy roast keep the sweetness check.  Oak, vanilla, and fresh, sweet-tart black cherries complete the rich, decadent symphony of scents.Flavors are even more complex.  Bold, dark chocolate and burnt caramel again lay the primary malt base.  Loads of vanilla and oak show throughout, tying in notes of mocha and espresso.  Fresh figs add a dark earthiness to the fruit profile, while cherries add a sherry-like quality.  Sour mash Kentucky bourbon just send things over the top, yet somehow a tremendous sense of balance and integration is maintained.Thick and nearly full bodied, light carbonation lends a silky, velvety, almost creamy mouthfeel.  Alcohol forces this one a little to the warm side, which makes for perhaps the only detractor to an otherwise fantastic palate. This is simply a fantastic creation, and one that must be slowly sipped and contemplated to be fully enjoyed.  Im dying to have another, but that will have to wait for an appropriate occasion.

Pours out a dark brown color with absolutely zero head.  Was hoping it wasnt a bad bottle.  Smell is full of bourbon and some sweet cherry / sherry flavors.  All of this infused with the typical dark fruit aroma that Adam usually brings.  Taste is what threw me off; I was expecting something sweet but what I got was a large amount of bourbon and a little bit of dark cherries floating in the mix.  Strange but still I kept drinking.  By the end of the bottle this stuff was really good.  But the initial impressions are that it needs to age for a long time.

Alcohol is there and boosted by the bourbon. The palate is full and thick with a low level of carbonation, the alcohol does become a bit warm and the barrels add a tannic character that detracts a bit. I was very impressed with this young but would definitely love to try it with some age as all it needs now is time to mellow and come into its own.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
2662,"2009-01-02",3.5,"12oz from a gentleman on BA - thanks, Rick! As a big fan of regular Adam I’d been looking forward to this beer quite a bit. It gets off to a promising start. While the dank, yeasty, currant-ish pour is quite still, that kind of body seems to suit the quality of a HotD wood-aged beer, as if something from the 14th century had been unearthed. The nose is strongly redolent of ripe cherries, and really appetizing. The mouthfeel is a bit slick and syrupy though. And as the beer warms up, the bourbon seems to overpower some of the finer elements of the base Adam - its spiciness, its rich blend of tobacco and malt and molasses - and leave an indistinct boozy flavor where previously there was a complex blend of malts, earthen flavors, spices, and bitter herbs. Still enjoyable, and I’m glad to have tried it, but I’m underwhelmed.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
2662,"2008-12-31",3.6,"12 oz bottle.  Dark purple brown; gives up some tan edging after a stiff pour.  Nose is tar, tobacco and molasses.  As it warms chocolate, cherry and sherry.  Silky mouthfeel but lack of carb leaves it a bit oily.  Taste is bourbon, bittersweet chocolate and earthy sour cherry.  Long dry finish with licorice, oak and alcohol.  Certainly a lot going on but too much barrel and not enough cherry for me.  Aging might help to blend the flavors.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
2662,"2008-12-31",4.3,"Thanks Beerlando!  Dark chocolate cherry color.  Smells is strong with alcohol, chocolate and bitter fruits.  Taste is woody, slightly smokey and full of chocolate and cherries.  Lots of flavors, great balance.  Great beer.","Orlando, Florida, USA","GodOfThunder"

2662,"2008-12-27",3.7,"12oz. bottle served in a snifter. Bottle conditioned. 2008 vintage. Poured brown with hints of red. Not a lot of carbonation, what head there is quickly dissipates. Great aroma with bourbon, vanilla, oak, fruit, and a hint of alcohol. Full bodied, but the lack of carbonation made it a bit syrupy. Very rich, complex malt profile. More oak and chocolate. Lots of vanilla from the oak. Long woody finish. A bit of tart cherry flavor, but not a lot. The lack of carbonation really diminished the beer to me.","De Soto, Kansas, USA","HomeBrewHawk"
2662,"2008-12-25",3.7,"Shared at miketds tasting

**Summary** - Thanks to mike for sharing this beer.  I was not expecting it to appear though I suppose I should not be surprised given the quality of his cellar.  This was opened towards the end of the night as we wound down.

**Aroma / Appearance** - Dense clear lacing reveal that this is a pretty intense beer.  Black and fluid it looks somewhat like regular Adam but is unique.  Cherry, coffee, malt, and chocolate create a profile that has less wood than I would expect.  Otherwise it was exactly as I imagined.

**Flavor / Palate** - Cherry, black coffee and then the warmth of the alcohol crawl across the tongue.  Until the finish it is satisfying and fun.  My only complaint is the point where it becomes a bit cloying.  Better than regular Adam I might seek out more of the ""Of the Wood"" releases as time permits.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
2662,"2008-12-23",4.0,"UPDATED: MAY 1, 2009 12 oz bottle generously given to me by acrdz.  Bottle opens with only a soft whisper.  Pour is a murky deep brown, with ruby highlights.  Only a very small off white head is visible on the pour, which falls fast.  Aroma jumps out of the glass with cooking brown sugar, dark cherry fruits with the wood and Bourbon behind.  This is a big nose, alcohol is present put not distracting.  The taste is much more about the wood, it takes the lead with cherry following soon behind.  Very much a dark, black cherry taste.  With the wood and the fruit, I really got a wine taste from this one.  The Black Cherry gives a bit of a sour edge which really complements the wood nicely.  The Bourbon appears mid palate and is very mild and refined.  Palate is medium to heavy, coats the mouth and has almost no carbonation.  Alcohol is barely present (only a pleasant warming in the after taste), which is actually quite remarkable given the ABV and barrel aging.  The sweetness, wood, and alcohol are all really nicely balanced in this one.  Mike, absolutely incredible of you to hand this one to me last week.  Avery was fun, but this is the highlight of meeting up with you!","Kansas, USA","theisti"

Notes of bourbon and sherry up front, lightly woody, dark chocolate, light smoke and vanilla.  Next to regular adam i thought this was  great spin and well refined or maybe the cask aging helped to attenuate the beer more.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
2662,"2008-12-19",3.7,"Bottle courtesy of WeeheavySD.  Thanks Jon.  Even as Im typing this Im not sure how Im going to rate this one.  There are many great qualities to highlight here.  Excellant example of barrel aging as the barrel wasnt predominant.  Very mild cherry flavor is present.  Mixed background of sherry and bourbon which is more dominant in the nose.  At the same time it tastes a little bland and I feel could be a little sweeter for more balance.  Im noting that the cherries fade as the beer warms.  Towards the end of the glass it feels like the flavor has overstayed its welcome and gets a little overbearing. Im going to have to rerate this one later down the road.","Livingston, New Jersey, USA","BrianK"
2662,"2008-12-17",3.3,"Major gusher.  Quickly diminishing thin foam, brown body.  Poor appearance.  Nose has some character to it, with a touch of smoke, black cherries and sherry notes.

2662,"2008-12-16",3.8,"12oz bottle. Pours murky, dark red/brown with a thin off white head, good lace. Smells very sweet and malty with lots of caramel, very complex. Light fruit and chocolate with a little bit of booze and barrel in the nose as well. Tastes malty and sweet with solid cherry flavors and some sweet bourbon and wood notes. I did not get much from the sherry, maybe some balance to the sweetness from the bourbon barrels. Lots of booze flavors throughout but they add nicely to the complexity. Not a ton of cherry flavor. Full body, subdued carbonation.","San Diego, California, USA","doubleo"
2662,"2008-12-15",4.2,"12oz bottle acquired in a couple trades. Poured a dark black color, with brown edges, and a smaller sized red tinted, off whtie head. Aromas of dark-black cherries, wood, sherry, and light bourbon. I would say the woodiness dominates the aromas with the black cherries coming in a close second. Tastes of black cherries, sherry, wood, chocolate, vanilla, and caramel. Sweet if a very light tart finish. More sweet and the tartness dissapeared as soon as I detected it. Light to medium alcohol in the finish.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
2662,"2008-12-15",3.0,"For being called CHERRY Adam from the Wood I am quite dissappointed with this beer.  Poured nearly flat, looks exactly like regular Adam, a rich, almost smokey aroma that masks all of the other aromas and flavors.  If this would have been called Smoked Adam, this would be a delightful beer, but I got absolutely NO cherries at all.  Thanks to miketd for sharing.","The Land of Milk and Honey, Ohio, USA","Cliff"
2662,"2008-12-14",2.9,"Pours basically black with no lasting head whatsoever.  Just some beige bubbles kicked up from the pour, but not a real head.  Smell is smooth and rich bourbon and oak, mainly and is quite nice.  Taste is a touch tart and perhaps fruity, but not cherries per se, and of course some bourbon and definite wood character.  Tart fruity malt flavor but only a very faint actual cherry flavor, even when looking for it.  Some very light alcohol in the flavor and its a touch warming.  Beer is flat after 5 minutes in the glass which kills the beer for me, and once again another overpriced and over hyped HOTD beer with a huge bottling flaw...   At about 15 dollars for a 12 ounce bottle plus shipping this is ridiculous.  This is not something I would buy again if it were 3 bucks.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

2662,"2008-12-11",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2010 UPDATED RATING: I just pulled an 08 from the cellar and this one has actually improved to my tastes. The flavors have melded to create better harmony on the palate, and does not finish as hot.  OLD RATING: Bottle courtesy of Ross via his connection in Portland. Many thanks to all who got this shit to my door. Pours a deep dark brown, with no head. Aroma is very nice, like black cherry and red wine. Rich and full bodied with very little carbonation. Flavor is pretty complex here. Black cherry and merlot dominates the flavor, but I get accents of chocolate, vanilla, sherry,  and hops. Finish is a tad hot, with lots of oak and cherry pit, as well as some acidity. This is at its best toward room temp. Good, but needs some more time in the bottle. Not as good as Adam. 3.9","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"
2662,"2008-12-08",4.2,"Sampled on 12/5/08. A big thanks to WeeHeavySD for sharing this one  at the 2008 San Diego Strong Ale Fest. The traditional Ale pours a dark black color from a 12oz bottle. Small sized white foamy head. The aroma is cherry, malts, dark fruits and oak. A medium bodied ale. The malts are caramel and sweet. The hops are floral. The cheery flavor is sort of subtle, but very intense and focused. Nice smooth finish. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
2662,"2008-12-07",3.8,"12oz Bottle. Aroma comes barreling out in mostly heavy roast malt alcohols. Sweet and a touch syrupy. However, some really interesting red character starts to blend in. Kirsch, tamarind, and light nutmeg. A faint waft of smoke. I can tell there is a tart edge in there somewhere. Pours a red mahogany, with a brown fringe and a swirl in tan. Low carbonation. Flavor is complex and hot, hot, hot. Woah. Is this pure brandy? Honestly, I do not get a hell of a lot of black cherry. In my opinion, black cherry is not the best cherry for beer. I do get a load of bourbon heat. There is a firm run of oak tannins and then some of the deeper roast and caramel of the base Adam. Big, bold, and brash. I can see the extreme beer community really getting lit up about this. One redeeming factor is that I do not feel like I am eating a handful of Black Forest chocolate cake. It is not too dense. I get the feeling that the black cherry liquids thinned out an otherwise sweet beast. The barrel, cherry and age are all brought together well and the beer does not feel disparate, but it is just a little too angry and hot for me. Thanks Darrell for the hook up!","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
2662,"2008-12-06",3.6,"Bottle from acrdz. Huge thanks for this. Ive been desperately wanting the love this the entire time its been in my glass, desperately wanting it to reveal itself. I poured it fridge temp and hoped itd come into its own as it warmed and breathed. While its gotten better, it hasnt become the mindblowing beer Id hoped. Oh well. There is a definite sherry presence in the nose, with a lot of alcohol burn, some chocolate and coffee and malt. Its complex but its not too special. The flavor is chewy and sweet, woody with only a touch of cherry, mostly some scotch and nut and oxidation. Again, complex but not desirable. This went down easy, maybe too easy.

2662,"2008-12-05",4.7,"Bottle provided to me by my main man in SD, Jon, much thanks&#033; Very dark and almost imperial stout like in appearance topped by a small but lasting frothy head and spotty lace. oily legs as well. The nose detects massive bourbon and sherry cask conditioning, vanilla, oak, grapes, dates, heavy ripened cherries, bittersweet bakers chocolate, smoke and peat, leather and tar, EXTREMELY over-the-top and wonderful. The taste has a hard time matching the nose but damn well tried. BIG HUGE MALT and twangy fruits reign throughout. Oak, vanilla, chocolate, and smoke add an excellent depth of palate. Such an earthy finish that words escape me... mineral, wood, herbs, fire, leather, pipe tobacco.. oh heck yes pipe tobacco, and even a h9int of pine cone. The mouth feel is very oily, lush and warming. A massive winter warmer for sure. WOW, I am just floored by this beer, among the finest of the year. Complex and huge displays a carnival of aromas and flavors.

2662,"2008-11-28",4.1,"12oz bottle, purchased @ HOTD.  Thanks, Alan!  Pours a very dark, murky, slightly violet-tinted black color; some viscosity; light tan head with fine-bubbled lacing.  Lots of dried dark fruits, fruit leather, and pitty raspberry / raisin / date notes in the aroma; tons of fruit leather and very dark, viscous fruitiness; very soft presence.  Full, heavily viscous mouthfeel: presence of warming alcohol, alongside tons of mouthcoating dried dark fruits (dates, raisins, black cherries), fruit leather, tobacco, and light sherry notes (reasonably softly presented); so much going on in this beer, so much to enjoy, and reasonably soft edges throughout aside from the slight presence of overt alcohol; another gorgeous beer from HOTD.  This should age beautifully, like everything else.  Lengthy finish: fruit leather, tobacco, and dried dark fruits; some chocolate and well-roasted coffee notes appear at the far end; very nicely roasted, with toasty maltiness.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
2662,"2008-11-26",4.1,"12oz. bottle, with thanks to LilBeerDoctor.  Pours blackish brown, with ruby highlights and a minimal bubbly pinkish white head that quickly
settles to a ring, minimal lacing.  Aroma is fresh cherry, blackberry, light oak, milk chocolate and a bit of whiskey. Flavor is more fresh cherry mixed with other dark fruits, oak, and as it warms more chocolate comes out as well.  Less dimension than the regular Adam, and really an entirely different beer, but nicely done just the same, and of course some age will no doubt make it even more interesting.  Thanks Margaret!","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"
2662,"2008-11-20",3.4,"Bottle.  Pours black with absolutely no head just bubbles.  Aroma of bourbon initially followed by chocolate and sweet cherries.  Flavor is also initially bourbony and quite warming.  Later, some sourness/tartness that seems to come from the cherries and woody notes make their appearances.  The bourbon is a bit on the strong side and does overpower the other flavors of the beer.  I wish that the cherry flavor was more prominent.  An interesting experiment, but bourbon-barrel aging doesn’t improve everything.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LilBeerDoctor"

Fairly flat pour. Very dark ebony brown with red hues towards the edges. Faint beige head, thing ring around the top. Oily flat body, lots of cherry and smoke coming through. Hints of burnt chocolate and sherry, lightly tart in the finish. Enjoyable now, but I think this will greatly improve in time.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
2662,"2008-11-16",2.7,"UPDATED: DEC 6, 2014 Faint hiss when opened.  A strong and tall pour yields a medium sized dark brown head.  Body is deep brown with hints of muddy purple.  Impenetrable.  Rich toffee, chocolate and tart cherries first noticed.  Wood character is soft but present without question.  Wafting alcohol and bitter, creamed black cherries play around with dark chocolate, cocoa, caramelized plums, etc.  Lovely and wonderful in every aspect.  Rich, viscous, smooth and thick on the palate, decadent cherry chocolate syrup on the middle of the palate turns to a rough, tannic bitterness on the back end.  Explosive is a good word to use. Entirely distinct from both Adam and Adam from the Wood.  One of the best new beers of the year.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
2662,"2008-09-16",4.7,"UPDATED: NOV 21, 2008 So most needed re-rate or real rate, since the version I had was in the barrel for only about 4 months compared to this 15 month version.  12oz bottle from the brewery release, one of the ones that came back with me on the plane.  Pours dakr purplish black with a thin tan head that has faded a bit to a tan ring.  The nose is really quite excellent, a blend of sherry, cherries, bourbon a touch of oak, and a tart sweetness.  Taste is excellent, rich sweet cherry notes that provide an excellent balance for the flavor of the adam, this is as Mike said a completely different beer from both Adam and Adam from the wood.  The taste and mouth feel are very vinious there is a big winelike quality here, that evokes the oak in the beer as well.  Every sip I seem to get a little bit of something different.  All in all this is excellent and the mouth feel is heavenly, its an amazing beer with a lot of flavor, and character, I can’t wait to see what happens to this over time.

Big thanks to Alan for letting me taste this one. It’s aged Hair of the Dog from the Wood with cherries added to the brew. It sits in bourbon barrels waiting to be bottled in November 2008.
Amber/brown colored brew. Bourbon, oak and wood in the aroma. And cherries ofcourse. Sweet maltiness too. Dark fruits, chocolate, sweet cherries, bourbon and a bit dry hoppy flavor. Interesting and very enjoyable. It’s a bit raw in the taste, will probably get a lot smoother when aged some more. Still it’s now pretty slick, round and smooth. I hope I will get a bottle of it too.","Zeist, NETHERLANDS","NoiZe"
