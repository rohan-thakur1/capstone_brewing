4529,"2013-03-11",4.7,"My Bottom Line:
This amazingly drinkable Svetly Vycepni develops spicy hop flavors and delicate hay and honeyed malts in an ever-so-cushiony mouthfeel made for endless sessions or refined food pairings. A masterpiece.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sturdy cake icing-like head of foam rests atop the perfect golden shine.
-Execution is superb ; every flavor is clearly expressed and of the same moderate intensity.
-Mouthfeel is unbelievably engaging. Pillowy AND quenching. A rare treat.
-This is not the kind of brew which will wow people for its intensity, or for its unique profile. It is simply the quintessence of Svetly Vycepni. Pure and honest ingredients in the cushiest of mouthfeels.
