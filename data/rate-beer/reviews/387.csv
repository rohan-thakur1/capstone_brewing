387,"2014-04-02",3.2,"Tap at moto-i , 2oz pour which is plenty for me, I definitely am getting the white pepper and green apple, though its a weird combo and im still finding some anise type flavor in there too, interesting mix at 18%","North Ridgeville, Ohio, USA","jmikolich"

387,"2013-02-23",3.2,"On tap in Minneapolis.  I think Ive been drinking really bad sake my whole life - this set me straight.","Minnesota, USA","mnmike"
387,"2012-04-01",3.3,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2014 Tap at moto-i. Almost clear pour. Nose and taste is rice, apple, and the alcohol is present but doesnt suggest 18%. Enjoyable.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
387,"2011-03-23",3.3,"Bottle @ moto-i. Slight yellow, off white appearance. Sweet, flour-like vinous nose. Dry, light apple, light banana, rice vinous flavor.  This is my first sake rating (and tasting) and it was pretty enjoyable.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
387,"2010-08-20",3.2,"~2 oz pour on draft at the Sake Brewpub in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Pour is clear, almost crystal though some very, very faint yellow does show.  Aroma is rice, touch of vanilla sweetness and a bit of floral.  Taste is the touch of sweetness at first, which moves smoothly to the rice.  The finish lingers nicely with floral berries.  Palate is medium bodied, hot and dry.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
387,"2009-06-01",3.3,"On tap at the brewpub on 05/31/2009. Very lightly hazy clear body with light but thick legs. Light rice and alcohol aroma. Light rice flavor with some vanilla and alcohol. Medium body with no carbonation.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","maniac"
387,"2009-01-12",3.7,"Sampler @ the Sake brewhouse. Clear as water.  Aroma is very strong alcoholic berries.  Mouthfeel a bit grainier than expected, felt a bit more like a distilled spirit.  Taste had some white tea and berry aspects.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
387,"2008-10-28",4.0,"On draught at the sake brewhouse in uptown, Minneapolis, MN. Pours a still, nearly clear sake with a drop of golden blonde with a clear disk top. Glass side leaves some excellent tear legs from its high alcohol level. Aroma of koji, a slight apple, almond, and just barely a hint of butter. Taste is full bodied, a slight buttery texture with flavors of light apple, marzipan, and a hint of pear as it comes to room temperature. Finish has a light floral and pear aftertaste with dry white pepper character that clears way for a strong alcohol presence. It’s strong alcohol, full body texture and a smooth floral character makes this one stand out compared to most other full cask strength genshu. Well Done!","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
387,"2008-10-28",3.2,"The strongest of the lot.  Clean alcoholic aroma with faint mold.  Mostly koji on the flavor with an incredibly smooth body considering the strong alcohol aroma.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
387,"2008-10-28",3.1,"Clear.  Honestly, no aroma whatsoever.  A very light taste of mold.  Quite a clean, pure alcohol flavor with minimal burn.  I’m impressed this did not taste like rocket fuel.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
