648,"2017-06-14",4.1,"Half pint at Jack Greene, Hobart. Black beer, creamy tan head, smells like expensive chocolate. Excellent body, viscous, luscious, smooth. Taste is drinking chocolate. Finish is more chocolate with touches of toffee. This is gorgeous sticky goodness and not as sweet (cocoa notes balance it out) as I have described it. Tasty, moreish, great fun beer.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","TedE"
648,"2017-04-05",4.2,"Poured from 750 ml bottle. Considerable head and foam retention. A decadent assault of cacao and vanilla on the nose. The hazelnut and milky velvet sublime taste in the mouth was discernable. 

An amazing belgian chocolate ale for dessert that will never fail to impress.","asuncion, PARAGUAY","nicolasgoddone"

648,"2017-01-19",3.2,"Poured with a ginormous tanned head requiring a couple of minutes to settle. Thick, black body with no light coming through the glass at all. Nice cacao whiffs. 
Deceptively subtle mouth feel, Im going through patterns of like and dislike between early sips. Settling on like. After a heavy period on barrel aged imperial stouts, the drink is now becoming a refreshing, lighter change.","","Devonbung"
648,"2016-12-19",3.1,"From a 750ml bottle on 19/12/2016. Pours close to black with evidence of yeast floaties, and a big, bubbly, uneven head. The nose is pleasant enough - suite strong chocolate notes, along with some caramel. Taste wise, theres lots of sweet chocolate and praline, which is greeted by an odd, slightly sour lemony bitterness.Medium bodied with lively carbonation. I didnt exactly love the imperial version of this, and this is not nearly as good. Interesting but a bit cloying and artificial tasting. I do have a sweet tooth when is comes to beers but this is not one Ill revisit.","Canberra, AUSTRALIA","Maris"
648,"2016-05-17",3.6,"On tap at Mrs Parma, pours black with a small tan head. Aroma is complex, with notes of vanilla, chocolate, and Belgian yeast - tastes just like pralines n cream. Flavour is along the same lines, with vanilla, cocoa and Belgian yeast. Tastes just like pralines n cream ice cream. Really nice dessert.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
648,"2016-04-16",3.4,"As per other comments, the beer is a bit of a gusher. Sweet, nutty aroma, pour is dark brown with tan head. Flavor is chocolate, nut and a hint of vanilla. Good, but one glass is sufficient.","Bentleigh, AUSTRALIA","Dredd"

648,"2016-03-05",4.4,"A fantastic beer to pair with dessert. They have balanced the chocolate and hazelnuts into the beer nicely making you wonder if these are malts or additions. Not sickly sweet. Malty with enough hops to not loose balance but a residual smokiness/chocolate from the cacao. This beer is really elegant and you will love sipping on this.","AUSTRALIA","Scotchy"
648,"2016-03-04",4.0,"750ml bottled shared with desert. Pours a rich dark chocolate brown with a nice dark tan head of creamy foam. The aroma is lovely, strong hazelnut, clear vanilla and chocolate. Similar to an oatmeal stout overall. The flavour is divine, just like a Belgian chocolate, the aroma matched in the taste. The body is a little light for me, not quite velvety with the level of carbonation and not as decadent and heavy as the flavour leads you to want. It has a good stout dryness to balance out the sweet notes. Sipped, but sipped enthusiastically. Great stuff overall. The imperial version must be superb.","Osaka, JAPAN","mrjez"

648,"2016-01-08",4.4,"A 750ml bottle with an enjoy before date of 17th December 2015 (so drank a little late, but Im not so worried for this style). Poured into a snifter glass. It poured a clear dark brown colour with an amber hue and a fluffy but thin half finger tanned head that didnt retain too well but left nice spotty lacing. Aromas were a very nice sweet hazelnut and chocolate with a hint of brown sugar. Taste was much like that aroma, and was like a tasty chocolate hazelnut cake. Light to mid body with light carbonation. Overall, this surprised me a lot. A very tasty beer that could replace dessert yet surprisingly not too sweet for me (and there are a lot of beers that I find too sweet). I would definitely buy this again.","Hong Kong, HONG KONG","davidezdonz"

648,"2015-09-19",3.8,"Didnt have the overcarbonation that some people have spoken of. The bottle I had was a little under carbonated if anything and quite syrupy. Fantastic nose, chocolate, vanilla, are prominent. Rich chocolaty taste that is also a little sweet but not overly so. I think it could have used a little more carbonation, but overall a different beer that is full of taste, aroma and would make a great desert beer.  ---Rated via Beer Buddy for Android","","Marc280"

648,"2015-06-22",3.4,"750ml bottle. Loses several points for its volcanic eruption of foam emerging from the bottle on opening that persisted for a couple of minutes.

648,"2015-03-17",3.7,"750mL bottle from Slowbeer. BB 30th Sept 2015
Missed out on this one at GABS last year - finally got my filthy mitts on a bottle!
Top notch looking stout - creamy tan head atop a near-opaque deepest darkest brown body.
Aroma is somewhat restrained - sweet milk chocolate, burnt toast, toasted hazelnut & Nutella, touch of latte & black fruits.
Body is bigger than expected, smooth, velvety bolstered by subdued carbonation. Has a slightly lingering chalky dryness associated with lactose.
Palate starts sweet, without being cloying - chocolate cake, toasted hazelnut, cola, roast malt char, slight sort of earthy plummy note. Restrained bitterness, some acrid roast astringency cuts through, drying finish.
Very tasty no doubt, just enough ""stoutiness"" to cut though the flavourings and to make it a more serious (and drinkable) beer.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

648,"2015-01-11",4.4,"Is exactly what you suspect you might get. Starts with a note of unwrapping a chocolate bar. Tastes like a fusion of beer and a hot chocolate on a ski resort. Its the sort of beer Id have around a fire playing backgammon. Delicious!","Highfields, AUSTRALIA","CraigH13"
648,"2015-01-10",3.8,"Bottle with Patrick. Very dark brown to black with a large, creamy tan head. The aroma is great with lots of dark chocolate and hazelnuts working wonderfully together.

I can understand why this was the 2014 GABS winner. An absolute dessert of a beer if Ive ever seen one. Its sweet, very vanilla forward, creme brulee-like, very nutty, milk chocolate, dusty cocoa, chocolate yoghurt. A whirlpool of flavours which balance perfectly in the aroma. Taste is like is dry cocoa up front before the vanilla swings in adding quite a fair bit of sweetness, although balanced well enough that it isnt over the top. Absolute milky chocolate, almost white chocolate in its creaminess, with a fair whack of hazelnuts. Forrero Rocher is bang on, cheers Kayne.

Very silky, getting towards ingratiatingly so. Rich and milk sweet with lots of chocolate and vanilla, less obvious hazelnut than in the aroma. A bit earthy and with a touch of sourness as well as sweetness that I sometimes get from milk. Dries out slightly at the end. Vanilla finish with modest bitterness that builds a little.
