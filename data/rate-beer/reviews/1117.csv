1117,"2016-11-04",4.5,"Draught at Row 34, 10/28/16. Nothing like a 3.5% fruity Florida Weisse on draught on a damp, cold, Fall Boston day....Thoroughly hazy maize-golden body shows a small, off white head of modest to low retention.Tropical fruits galore in the nose focusing quite heavily on the passion fruit which adds the most balancing acidity and funky, earthy, tart notes. Lime, guava, mango, pineapple; the gangs all here and with a VERY high aromatic strength. Light lactic acid, wheat-like biscuity/cracker character and tart, tropical juice linger on the clean, alcohol-free finish.Juicy and soft in the mouth, its amazing to me how far beer has come. On one hand, I question why Im not just having a glass of tropical fruit juice, but on the other, it would be hard to find such an unfiltered, tart, fresh, spectacularly-flavored glass of juice anywhere except in your own kitchen with a juice machine. Add to that the lovely wheat softness and dryness and the fact that the senses scream ""THIS IS ALSO BEER"" and I guess you have your answer. Just stupidly drinkable and enjoyable regardless of your thoughts on Florida Weisses. It really is as good as the hype and I hope to try the dragon fruit berliner soon.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1117,"2015-12-24",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2016 Bottle courtesy of Ryan at the Lambic Cave, November 14th, 2015. Worth noting, the original batches of Miami Madness at CCHD, FitR, and the Berliner Bashes, were one of the best beers Ive ever experienced, and a clear 5.0/5.0. Really happy to be able to try these again - and especially curious to try the bottle format, and of course under Wakefields new system. Pours a bright hazy golden body with thin white lacing. Looks materially different than the first few batches - which essentially poured like deep, thick pineapple/orange juice. Nose is straight passionfruit - and a bit juicier than the DFPF offering. Mouthfeel is tart and fruity with the passionfruit perfectly pronounced alongside additional tropical notes of pineapple, mango and guava. RERATE:: Both at GABF 2015 and 2016. Similar to DFPF, these tasted way better kegged than bottle conditioned. Both GABF experiences were much closer to my original memory of drinking these beers during the original Berliner Bash days.

Aromas of mango and guava, followed by passion fruit and under-ripe pineapple. Light wheat, light musty basement/cobweb and a light peachy yeast/lacto. Taste is a medley...more like wave after wave...of huge guava, mango and passion fruit. Each fruit giving its little burst of flavor. The lacto brings an assertive tartness to the fruity sweetness. Pretty damn harmonious! The mid-palate is full of fruit punch before the finish provides a very clean sour note.

Pours a hazy straw yellow hue, natural applesauce and shandy color with firm haziness, still a pleasant brighter glow throughh all that. Hazy brighter white head atop is sizable, pleasant, thicker ringer laces well enough. Aromas show a melange of guava and starfruit, touches of tropical essence, grapefruit and kiwi. Some nice potent fruit life. Initial is lighter bodied, distinct tropical guava appeal is tart, green and fruity. A jab of pineapple, starfruit and pineapple. Nice tartness up front tapers out a bit as we progress. Some gentle bready malts, yogurt and straw, citric acidity is pleasant and enjoyable. That guava really stands with me though, a jab of subtle passionfruit, lacking the all out sweetness of say a mango or papaya. Dry, sour and lactic finish with good flavors. Not quite as bright as I remember a few years back offhand but I think thats a good thing, allowing Stush to stand up a little better with on point sourness, not as much residual fruit sweetness.

Highly drinkable. A very nice beer.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
1117,"2015-10-04",3.7,"Tap at Route CBC. It pours super cloudy creamy gold with a small white head. The nose is initially quite subdued - musty, funky, cheesecake, stone fruits, apricot, bread and barnyard, but it opens up as it warms - pineapple, passion fruit, guava, banana and bubblegum. The taste is crisp, crazy tart, lots of sherbet, lemonade, good mouth-pucker, mild acidity, apricot, peach, passion fruit, pine apple and fruit cocktail with a dry, fruity finish. Light -medium body and fine, prickly carbonation. It certainly grew on me. Plenty of flavour for the abv. Good.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"

1117,"2015-10-02",5.0,"Pours like a hazy light yellow-orange color, initial taste is extremely sour and citrus like but quickly evolves to a bitter while in mouth and the after taste and finish leaves a nice balance of malt and good as if the prior tastes and notes never happened. While the flavor is tart on the tongue and becomes sour I used to generally feel I wanted a malty, grain like taste when I had a beer , otherwise Id have a juice drink, the after taste comes in to give you just that. Rarely have I had a beer or any drink or food that can have different notes so distinct all in one sample and transition from each so well despite each being different. Not usually a fan Sours but this Beirliner is crafted so well I was taken aback an impressed so much I had to rate it and share. After having this beer I feel it is the benchmark for a Sour or Beirliner.","Coral Springs, Florida, USA","CAMILO4891"
1117,"2015-09-27",4.7,"Pours a cloudy straw like color. Aromas of tropical fruit. Initial fruit juice that quickly disappears to a slightly sour taste. Amazing beer!","Arizona, USA","kcorum10"
1117,"2015-09-24",4.8,"From notes. Enjoyed on September 19 at Travis house. 750 mL bottle shared by Mike. Damn! This thing is amazing. The pour is a bright cloudy yellow. You can still see through, but its not clear. There is a nice white head that falls to a collar leaving a couple wisps of lace. The aroma is awesome. A blast of tropical fruits all up in your grill. Mango, pineapple, guava, passionfruit... Theyre all here. There is a nice light tart crispness that is unlike any other Berliner Ive had before. Its amazing. The flavors are just as good as the aromas, if not a little better. Its so crisp and clean. The bright fruits are very prominent with a great subtle tartness that you just cant beat. The mouth feel is crisp and light with a nice bubbly carbonation and a lingeringly smooth beautiful fruit. First J. Wakefield beer, but holy damn, theyre onto something.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

1117,"2015-09-16",4.4,"On tap at the Brewery. Milky pale yellow pour with a fluffy white head. Tart lemon bouquet. Tart but not overly sour with big citrus notes. Guava and mango backbeats. The perfect summer drink. Low ABV, big bold mouthfeel, and a full body. Another stunner from Jonathan!!!","Florida, USA","50belair"
1117,"2015-09-06",4.4,"Draft at JW Brewing. Pours a very cloudy pale yellow color that is topped by a thin layer of off white foam at the head. The aroma shows a melody of tropical fruit up front with tart guava, passion fruit, banana, and mango that is balanced out by the lactic sourness and grainy wheat from the base Berliner. The flavor follows with lots of tropical fruit sweetness with mango and passion fruit most noticeable along with some tart guava. The sweetness gets washed away from the grainy wheat, lactic sourness, and some minerals from the base beer. The base beer Stush is spot on with the wheat, sourness, minerals and the overall flavor. Medium bodied with soft carbonation and pleasing tartness that leads to a lengthy tropical fruit finish. Just delicious stuff that I could drink a ton of on a hot day. Amazing beer. Wakefield kills it with the fruited Berliners.","Windermere, Florida, USA","juiceisloose"
1117,"2015-09-03",4.0,"Draft at the brewery - Pours a cloudy orange/yellow. Nose is guava, slightly tart. Taste is more guava, slight passionfruit. Light tartness, pretty easy going down.","Port St. Lucie, Florida, USA","biggsbowler"
1117,"2015-08-30",3.5,"On tap at MD release. Pours a cloudy slightly dark yellow that hints on being brownish which is kinda strange. Aroma up front is super sweet tropical fruit. A little dirty, overripe, and musty tropical fruit thing going on. Extremely sweet on the tongue then a rush of sourness wipes that away. A touch grainy end palate. Ends up with an odd water profile that kind of reminds me of water from a rubber hose. Overall a nice take on this rush of berliners with fruit that seems to be happening all over right now. Really would like to mess around with making cocktails out of this to add more than just he sweet/sour elements.","@ $13.99, Iowa, USA","DietPepsican"

Sour passionfruit and a mineral finish. Light and well carbonated. Different from how I remember it, but nice.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
