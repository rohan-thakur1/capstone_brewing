2026,"2017-05-02",3.8,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance was a deep brown color with a fingers worth of light off white foamy head that fell off at a good pace. Mild stringy lace.
The aroma had some roasted nuts, light toast, cocoa powder, light earthiness. Some grassy hops.
The flavor blended the sweet to the roast and followed into the aftertaste pretty nice. Quick malty and roasty finish.
The feel was centered around a medium body with a fine sessionability about it. Gets somewhat creamy along my tongue. ABV might have been a bit high for the style but still gets it done just right - good job to the brewers.
Overall, pretty well done brown ale worthy of having again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
2026,"2017-02-22",4.0,"On tap, Ginger Man Boston. Deep dark brown colour, white head. Nice one this, strong malty flavours, some toasty and slightly roasty with hints of toffee and a bitterness too. Brown malt. Large hop bitterness, spicy, not too much fruit, good balance with malts. Very nice.","Greater London, ENGLAND","JorgeLee"
2026,"2016-09-22",3.7,"16 oz. can thanks to Willrunforbeer for the share. Fresh canning date of: 8-26-16. Aroma shows roasted nuts, peanut shells, and deep grain. Appearance of a deep brown, with light white head lacing the glass. 
Taste of roasted nuts, mild toast, cocoa, and some earthiness. Palate has a medium body, creamy texture, soft carbonation, and toasty. Gosh damn, for a brown ale this is really a standout. Very finely constructed.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

2026,"2015-03-14",3.3,"On tap. Felt like this drank more like a stout than a brown ale. Semi creamy texture. Slightly sweet flavor with a fairly pronounced roasted quality. Decent beer, but would not but again.","New Jersey, USA","demannu"

2026,"2014-11-30",3.6,"Purchased from Carriagetown earlier today. $8.00 for the 650 mL bottle. To red wine glass, it pours a mahogany-tinted reddish dark brown with which a trim beige ringed head 1 pinky nail in length stood. Aromas of autumnal leaves, chestnuts, flaked barley, biscuit malt, wet newspaper, bird feed, California yeast, pumpernickel, and American noble hops. Tastes the same with the addition of roasted bananas, minerals, and leather. I wish the nuttiness had been stronger, but overall this is a cunningly solid brown ale. Damn, New England has been killing it in the brown ale category in the last few years.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
2026,"2014-08-03",3.4,"Location: 22 oz bottle from Buy Rite, 8/3/14


Aroma: The nose is burnt malts mostly, some coffee, nuts, and some burnt toast

Appearance: It pours a dark brown color with a thin beige head and sheeting steaks of lace

Flavor: The flavor is dry and roasty, unsweetened coffee, and some burnt toast flavors

Palate: The body is medium, clean and smooth, with a dry, burnt kind of finish on the mouth

Overall Impression: 
This is a pretty solid beer.  I didnt mind the burnt toast flavor that comes through on the finish, but it sort of flushes everything from the early part of the palate out, which does take away from the overall performance of the beer.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
2026,"2014-05-05",3.6,"Strong coffee nose, especially for an ABA. Cloudy brown, slippery medium tan head. Pecan and coffee flavor, more of the former. Cola also present, little hop presence. A bit of sugar cane sweetness.","Staunton, Virginia, USA","obguthr"

Full body, well rounded mouthfeel, assertive roast flavors. Balanced, good length, bitter but flavorful finish. 
Bitter, not very dry, acidity not evident but not flat. 
Intense, good quality, lingering coffee flavor. 
Delicious and apprropriate to all ends of the meal.

2026,"2013-12-17",3.8,"Bomber. Pour is murky dark brown with a medium light tan head. Smell is roasted nuts, caramel, hops. Taste is deep roast with caramel, toasted almonds, bakers chocolate and cascade. Very dry finish, I like that it isn't overly sweet. Pretty good.

2026,"2013-11-29",4.0,"Rich, malty aroma with roast coffee, chocolate, wood, and nuts. Flavor is surprisingly smooth given the big aroma, malty and bittersweet. I didnt detect a lot of alcohol in the finish, just some nice roast coffee bitterness. Overall a really good beer for a cold fall day. First beer Ive tried from this brewer, and I will try more.","Taunton, Massachusetts, USA","annunz123"
2026,"2013-10-15",3.9,"Poured from 22 oz. bottle. 

Opaque, very dark brown with a 2-finger tan head and excellent lacing. 

Aroma of roasted coffee, chocolate, tons of hazelnuts, toast, a hint of Mandarin orange and maybe other very mild hoppy elements. 

Taste of chocolate, sweet roasted malt, slightly bitter roasted coffee, hazelnuts , peanut butter cups, molasses, toast and mild citrus. 

Medium/full body and medium carbonation. 

This is one over-the-top brown ale. There is nothing subtle here except the hops.

2026,"2013-09-04",3.6,"Bottle. Pours a dark brown body with a nice one inch frothy dark brown head that had nice retention. The nose is really nutty and chocolaty with an undercurrent of earthiness and caramel. Minimal hops on the nose, but the malt is so intense its probably hard for any to make it past. The flavor is very nutty as well, hard to believe that all this flavor comes from just the malt. A nice mix between the residual sweetness and slightly husky and earthy malt. Theres a light hop bitterness on the back end, but theres not much. Medium bodied and almost chewy in texture with just a bit too much frothy carbonation. Pretty nice Brown, but I could maybe do with a little less alcohol in here.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
2026,"2013-08-13",4.0,"Brune opaque tirant sur le noir, avec un bon col de mousse, elle présente des notes de noisettes, de chocolat au lait et de diverses céréales rôties. En bouche, le mélange de houblons vient ajouter une pointe damertume à un breuvage rond et bien malté, offrant des saveurs de noisettes grillées, de chocolat amer, et en fin de compte assez peu de sucres. Savoureuse, plutôt puissante, elle est veloutée et agréable. Une brown ale américaine relativement accessible mais sans compromis.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","lesifflebiere"
