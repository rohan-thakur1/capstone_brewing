[ Bottle ][ blomster ][ 33cl ][ Pizza Poy Snifter ][ Trade ][ 2/24/14 ]
>> Thank you Christer for this rarity. Was expecting this one to be good- it was beyond excellent. Soft carbonation generates a low, but tight reddish mocha head on inkier black ruby to ink. Nose generates the best aged Bells Expedition with cinnamon graham cracker, light vanilla, thicker Mexican chocolate disc, black cherry pie. Taste is dark chocolate with black cherry flambee, cinnamon graham cracker, 70% cacao Mexican chocolate disc, mild pepper spice. Palate is similar to drinking chocolate with crunchy cocoa nibs. Decadent but not sweet at all, rather perfectly balanced and has a transcendental quality that makes me not treat this like an Imperial Stout as hops and roast as not crucial elements here. Body isnt too heavy either. For any im-porter lover out there, this is a rarity worth seeking out.

Pours thick and syrupy pitch black with a massive 2 inch light brown head with a lengthy retention - probably one of the best looking beers Ive had for a long while. Sweetish chocolate aroma combined with licorice overpowers the roastiness in the nose yet maintains a certain freshness. Solid body, incredibly velvety smooth mouthfeel. Again the roast is downplayed leaving room for sweet chocolate, vanilla, raisins in rum and then also some lovely aromatic hops that prevents this from ever getting cloying in spite of a low bitterness. Incredibly smooth and well balanced. 130212","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"
