2680,"2017-04-11",4.2,"Bottle shared by alexsdad06. Poured a black color with an average froth tan head that lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted chocolate malt, caramel, dark fruit and alcohol aroma. Medium to heavy sweet toasted dark chocolate malt flavor with a heavy complex sweet and small alcohol bite finish of long duration. Full body with a smooth texture and flat carbonation. This is a standout beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"

2680,"2017-03-05",4.3,"From notes. Enjoyed at a tasting at Abus house on February 22. 12 oz bottle, blend 6. The pour is a heavy dark black with a thin darker tan head that falls slowly to a thin ring, leaving no lace. The aroma is incredible. There is a big bourbon up front and a lot of dark fruits. There is a raisin, plum, molasses, heavy darker chocolate, light brandy, lots of woodiness. Its just so complex. There is a lot of caramel and toffee that comes rolling in about half way through. The flavor is just as good. There is a little more subtle oak from the bourbon and brandy, but the dark fruits explode. There is a heavy chocolate and caramel that goes with it. Its sweet molasses, dark fruits, charred oak, and a hint of bourbon and brandy. This is just phenomenal. The mouth feel is a little lighter. There is a nice soft carbonation and a lingeringly charred oak, molasses, and dark fruit heaviness that lingers and lingers. This is freaking fantastic!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
2680,"2017-03-01",4.3,"Motor oil Black.
I wont be able to do the complexity of this big complex beer justice here. Apple brandy and bourbon in equal measure, chocolate covered raisins, lighter vanilla, dark malts and fruit, toffee. Just about rivals Firestones aV ales.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

2680,"2017-02-22",4.3,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 12/19/2016. Pours opaque dark brown/black color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of huge milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, fudge, vanilla, brown sugar, coffee, bourbon, brandy, toasted oak, brown bread, and nuttiness; with light smoke, molasses, raisin, plum, fig, date, apple, licorice, tobacco, herbal, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, bourbon/brandy barrels, and light-moderate fruity yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of huge milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, fudge, vanilla, brown sugar, coffee, bourbon, brandy, toasted oak, brown bread, and nuttiness; with light smoke, molasses, raisin, plum, fig, date, apple, licorice, tobacco, herbal, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light roast bitterness and bourbon/brandy/oak spice on the finish. Lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, caramel, toffee, fudge, vanilla, brown sugar, coffee, bourbon, brandy, toasted oak, brown bread, nuttiness, light dark fruit/smoke, herbal, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, bourbon/brandy barrels, and light-moderate fruity yeast flavors; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Minimal dryness. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/silky, fairly grainy, and slightly sticky/chalky mouthfeel that is great. Mildly warming alcohol for 12.2%, with zero barrel booziness. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged blended strong ale! All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, bourbon/brandy barrels, and light-moderate fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to drink for the big ABV. Amazing integration and balance of the barrels and the 4 style flavors. All have distinct presence in the finished beer. Great barrel presence without being boozy or overly tannic/drying. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

2680,"2017-02-10",3.3,"Smell is pretty boozy heavy on the bourbon. Appearance is motor oil and flat mouthfeel and taste are where it is at though finishes with throat burn. Thick lush feel. Molasses taste along with bourbon then finishes sticky sweet. Not my thing.","Rochester, New York, USA","jb"
2680,"2017-02-03",4.1,"Poured from a 12 oz bottle. 
Aroma is rich and malty. Chocolate and toffee dominate with some lighter nut, caramel and toasted bread notes. Light tobacco and leather. Some light alcohol spice. Medium dark fruit notes with raisin, plum and prune. Hints of sherry. 
Pours black with a medium large, thick, mocha head that exhibits really good retention as it recedes to a small, thin creamy film that lingers. Light lacing and fairly long legs. 
Flavor is very sweet with lots of chocolate and some lighter toffee and caramel. Light roast, nuts and tobacco. Some medium light dark fruit notes with raisin, plum and prune. Low bitterness and light alcohol spice. Barrels add some light sherry notes, some vanilla and coconut and nice oak notes. Hints of bourbon. 
Mouthfeel is full bodied and slightly silky with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a tasty beer. Lots of nice barrel characteristics that work well with the malt profile. I think the flavor is a bit better than the aroma though as the barrels really come through nicely in the flavor and the malt profile is a bit more pronounced.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

2680,"2017-01-30",3.8,"12 oz. bottle. Pours black with almost no head. Smells of strong brandy and oak. Lots of fudgy chocolate. A little nutty. Tastes of chocolate. Bourbon. Brandy is still present and pretty strong in the back end, but not as dominant as it is in the nose. Woody with a lot of brandy in the finish. Heavy. Pretty good.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
