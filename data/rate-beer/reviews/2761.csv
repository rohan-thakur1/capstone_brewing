Elle ne sent pas très fort, mais en sefforçant, on parvient à sentir du malt et des bonbons fruités. Elle a un goût dune bière ambrée, cest-à-dire, de malt, de caramel avec un côté métallique. Mais en même temps, cest plutôt atypique, comme si cétait des particularités en parallèle. Cest suret et âcre. (872-241013)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","AlainG"
