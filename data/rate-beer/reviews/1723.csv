Bananna, clove, lemony citrus and yeast nose with a taste to match. Not my usual cup of tea, but when in Rome (or a German Brewery)!

Aroma of wheat and yeast with a little fruitiness. Flavors or banana, clove, and spiciness. Isnt this what a German Wheat is all about? VERY SOLID INDEED!!!!","Centerville, Ohio, USA","clingman71"

1723,"2007-03-06",3.7,"3/06/2007 at Hofbrauhaus Newport...   Golden orange color, cloudy.  Lasting, foamy, large off-white head.  Aroma of banana and clove.  Flavors of wheat malt, banana, and subtle clove.  Nicely balanced between the malt, esters, and spice.  Medium-full body with a bit of heft to the smooth and creamy mouthfeel.  A really good hefe, but maybe a bit too restrained (but well balanced overall).  Well-rounded beer; very nicely crafted.  This is my favorite of the Hofbrauhaus Newport beers that Ive had so far...

1723,"2007-01-03",3.4,"Pours golden and hazy with a mostly receding white head. Aroma of sweet banana, and spicy yeast. Taste is lightly sweet, banana, but the esters are restrained and balanced by the wheat and a bit of clove. Mouthfeel is medium with lively carbonation. Good, but a bit grainy and wheaty, and not enough esters.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","TheBeerOrg"
1723,"2006-09-03",3.6,"Draft at the brewhaus. Pours a nice cloudy golden orange with a pillowy white head. Nice banana clove esters in the aroma. Nice mouthfeel for a hefe. Flavor of wheat malt, yeast, and a mild notes of clove. Nice clean zesty finish. Very solid, best beer of the night. To make this great in my book, it just needs a little more boldness in the flavor and finish, and a bit more sweetness. Just a personal though. I would have no problem drinking this again.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"
1723,"2006-08-21",3.4,"Draught at the brewery.  Has a proper hefeweizen appearance:  soft and cloudy yellow colored body with a tall white head.  Sour esters in the nose, with some celery and lactic notes.  Funky sour cheese and banana flavors abound in this hefeweizen, and it actually tastes a little strange compared to style definitions.  Not the classic German hefeweizen, but still tasty and certainly drinkable.  Funky is a good word for this beer.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1723,"2006-08-20",3.8,"Properly cloudy with a tall dense white head.
The nose is vibrantly full of clove at first then smooth banana. Just the right amount of malt sweetness before a tasty wheat tang in the finish. Full bodied and filling. One of the better Hefes Ive had recently.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"
1723,"2006-06-20",4.1,"Tap. Clouded yellow with a thick lasting head. Uh-oh, Ive been spotted, some guy just came over to the bar and introduced himself, he saw my gabf shirt and my fat ass sitting here reading a book and scribbling notes, and thought I was a brewer, I told him, no just a beer geek, I think he put it all together, that I was taking notes on the beer, not the book (I was doing both, Michael Marshall Smith writes some great lines that I do note down in the other section of my notebook) he tries to lead me toward the darker beers, saying the dunkel, which I just had is the best, Im disagreeing, this right here is just what I need after a few hours in the sun. I should have written his name down, damnnit! Aroma of burnt matches and warm lemon juice that made my mouth water a bit. Wow, this is exactly what I needed to quench that rawness in me for a bit. Nice wheat flavor that is sweet and satisfying. Light banana bread flavor is great. Slick clean finish that left sweet banana behind and an assload of clove.

1723,"2005-11-27",3.6,"I wont bore you with the usual descriptions of flavor, appearance, and nuance this go around.  Suffice to say that this is a quality south German Weizen not unlike what we import in bottles and drink with regularity in the US.  It has the expected balance between yeast and spice that we expect.  The difference here is, it is fresh at the brewery in Newport.  Brewed the same as the facility in Munchen.  An excellent representation of the style, and as good or better than most American offerings.  In the summer I could have drank three liters!  Very refreshing.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"

1723,"2005-09-17",4.1,"I was really impressed by this wheat style german brew. smelled strong of florals, and citrusy. It had a very orange, citrus color too. Im not dissapointed in the taste at all. Not to much wheat in the taste. Mostly sweet and simple, but not overpowering with sweetness. Medium-bodied. I loved this beer. The best german wheat ive had yet. I would definitely recommend to others.","Covington, Kentucky, USA","bethmatt0421"

1723,"2003-10-06",3.4,"I ordered this without the lemon wedge at the Hofbrauhaus in Newport.  I think it is a little odd that the HB brand concept chose Newport KY for a franchise, but who am I?  Back to the beer.  Very cloudy butterscotch color with a rocky white head and a strong yeast nose.  Some clove sharpness with a tangy citrus bight and an almost lactic acidity.  Finish was of yeast and wet cardboard.  I'd get the dunkel instead.","St. Marys, Ohio, USA","jsquire"
