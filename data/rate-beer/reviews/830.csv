830,"2016-07-03",3.2,"(50 cl bottle from the brewery; Batch #1375; BBD: July 2017) Poured at fridge temperature into a small Chios Brewery pilsener glass reveals a cloudy amber with two fingers of fluffy white head. The head fades somewhat but stays around leaving lace. Aroma is subdued sodapop, straw, grass and citrus fruit. Not terribly exciting. Oily texture, medium carbonation, medium to light body and a lingering, grassy finish. Flavour has a mild bitterness and a little counterbalancing sweetness. Decent beer but I find it difficult to appreciate the 뇯opforward pilseners in general.","DENMARK","humlelala"
