1364,"2016-03-28",4.3,"Deep garnet with a beige and voluminously foamy head which lasts well and gives the beer a lighter feeling. Aroma is caramelised toffee, with maybe a slightly nutty backdrop which almost exactly mimics the taste. A slight amount of bitterness to counteract the sweet caramel taste and a perfectly gauged mouthfeel to complement both the level of carbonation and the ABV. A very easy drinking and (relatively) low ABV beer to enjoy all night. Nothing spectacular but sometimes you just fancy a very well executed and balanced low ABV beer and at this Hot Rocks excels.","West Midlands, ENGLAND","ABT_S54"

Smelled roasty malts up front. Also chocolate, caramel, toffee and nuts. Reminded me a bit of a Newcastle. 

Tasted similar to the nose with roasty malts and nutty malts coming through the most. Also caramel, toffee and chocolate with some bitterness on the tongue after. 

Medium body. Creamy-to-sticky texture. Average carbonation. Bitter finish. 

I probably gave this beer a bit better rating than I should have. It definitely had its moments.","","User134089"

1364,"2012-03-15",3.5,"Bottle conditioned 22 oz in pint glass. 
Aroma. Very malty with burnt nose. 
Appearance. Quite dark red/brown color with pale foam. What little light makes it through shows a clear beer. Decent attempt at lacing. 
Taste is very clean, almost simple malt on the front, but the finish is brûlée all the way. Unnoticeable hop. Alcohol warms the back palate and throat. Very malty for a lager, but it IS a dunkel. As it warms the alcohol is most evident character, and that's at only 6.5% ABV. 
Mouth feel is a bit over-carbonated for such a caramel malt forward beer. Reduced carbonation reveals creamy textures. 
Overall. A fun drink with the dark burnt maltiness and minimal astringency with a clean lager yeast profile.

1364,"2012-03-13",3.9,"A - Pours a dark black with a hint of red and a finger of frothy khaki colored head. The head fades down very slowly leaving behind some nice lace.

S - The aroma is a mix of roasted chocolate and caramel malts with a touch of burnt malt and some dark fruit with some earthy hops and bit of lager yeast.

T - Starts off with a mix of roasted chocolate and caramel malts with some earthy hops and light bitterness. Through the middle some more burnt malt and lager yeast flavor comes through. The finish is a mix of roasted chocolate malt, lager yeast, and earthy hops.

M - Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth with a roasted, dry, and lightly sweet finish.

D - Very drinkable. Feels smooth with a nice roasted dryness that balanced the hop and other flavors nicely.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"

A nice nose that is rich sweet malt often noted in brown ales.  A bit of chocolate.  The flavor begins with that cocoa and that stays consistent.  Just a hint of fruit and very soft hops are tasted.  The finish is bitter hops.  My single complaint is that the 6.5% ABV seems bigger and is too prominent in the flavor.

_________________________________________ to jdubfl for the extra.

Pours into my large dimpled mug a decently dark brown with orangeish hues on the edges. The head is large and off-white. 

The smell is medicinally hoppy with some nice malt character. 

The mouthfeel is noticeably watery, which is a downer. The beer tastes alright though, not much like a Euro Dark lager though. It is almost like a porter meets bock. The chocolate malt is pretty evident as is the caramel.

It is ok, not true to style at all but not bad.

1364,"2010-10-23",3.4,"The label says this is a collaboration with Bend Brewing, but it is under just the Port imprint. I like the hot rocks technique.

They are the people who invented saunas after all - they like taking rocks and heating them until they are glowing red.  Very dark pour.  Lightly metallic aroma.

(Had to share this one, it is so good.) Pours a deep cola brown with a faint ring of light tan foam and no lacing. One bottle had the sediments disturbed, resulting in a muddy appearance and a not entirely pleasant shift in flavors. Watch out for that. Let this one settle. Aroma is light rye toast and toffee. Taste favors the flash fired malts with a slight hint of charcoal, Asam tea, dried apricots, black cherries, and a mild hop bitterness. The finish is somewhat dry. A very satisfying and tasty lager.","Austin, Texas, USA","ManvsCity"
1364,"2010-08-16",3.6,"This is an interesting beer if not for the flavor, for the process they used. Id be interested to know how much of the dark color comes from caramelization from using the red hot rocks to boil and how much comes from the malt bill itself. Regardless, it is a pretty garnet color w/ only a small head of tight white bubbles. The nose is sweetened coffee and a bit of toffee. This is sort of porter-like, I think Id classify it as a schwartzbier though it is a bit strong alcohol-wise for that so perhaps it is more of a bock beer. Flavor is again some very nice roasted grain notes combined w/ coffee and caramel sweetness and the yeast character is very clean so as not to distract from this. This beer is medium bodied, which works, but the carbonation is just a bit too prickly. It would be better, in my estimation, if it were either lighter bodied or if the carbonation was a bit finer. Still, this is a lovely beer that does have its interesting qualities aside from the process used to create it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

1364,"2010-03-10",3.8,"22oz bottle. Pours a brown-amber colored body with a finger-width, creamy, tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is medium sweet with some floral fruits, hazelnut caramels, roasty cereal grains, and a brown malt earthiness. Flavor is similar. Some initial floral fruits quickly transition into a nutty, cocoa, caramel malt sweetness with a bit of a cereal grain feel. A clean roastiness comes out towards the end as well as some chocolate and a bit of a grassy hop. Finishes dry with a balanced maltiness and roasty, light bitterness. Aftertaste lingers for a lengthy duration after a medium body that feels watery at times, but works well. Very smooth and clean with a soft carbonation. Overall, a pretty cool beer. Not what I expected from the label, but the blend of caramel, cocoa, roast, and hops made this very enjoyable. I liked this one a lot.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

1364,"2010-01-18",3.6,"Bottle from Kris Wines, shared with MesandSim and suesbeerblog. Pours a russet brown with a thin but lasting beige head, not quite the pale golden lager I was expecting. Has a sweet and malty nose, slightly earthy. Taste is similar, grainy, nutty, toasty malts and some caramel sweetness, kinda reminded me of a Belgian dubbel in a way. Theres a smokey, mineral element which one can only assume is a result of the unique brewing process, or possibly a little peated malt added for effect? None the less, it does the job. Ends with a subtle hoppage in the finish but falls a bit thin on the palate for my liking, however, thats just me being picky.

Pours a dark nearly opaque brown, a bit reddish on the edges with decent offqhite head that dies to a decent film, laces ok enough. Aromas are a bit of a sweet maltiness, a touch of brown sugar and light caramel candies. Bit of toast and nuts, coupled with faint vanilla sweetness and chocolate, more on the softer side than bitter. Initial is decent bodied, toasty and smoothed out with a nice creaminess. Vanilla, chocolate, caramel, and a good nuttiness round out the base flavors, moving to a light brown sugar, touch of roast and decent bitterness on the backend. The roast and bitterness stay on the palate well, as this beer should be a bit lighter than expected, but still packs pretty good flavor for just a dunkel. The sweetness isnt cloying, as roast and toast with pretty good hoppiness come in to balance. I liked this beer for what it was, and only qualm may have been that the bitterness and roast on the finish, although enjoyable, could have been smoothed out a bit for a more sessionable experience.

1364,"2009-08-12",3.4,"My Bottom Line:
Smoky dark chocolate is found within roasted and toasted cereals, leading to a levelled bitterness of roasted malts and wooden hops.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam covers the dark mahogany.
-An intrusive vegetal character was kind of bothersome.
-This is very drinkable throughout; the mouthfeel is conducive to taking large gulps.
-I really like the flavors that come from the grain bill here.

1364,"2009-07-22",3.5,"In short: A lot of creamy brown cereals, almonds and notes of black pepper.  Nice brew that stands out in the USA market.
How: Bottle 22oz.  Sent to me as a bonus by toncatcher.  Thanks a lot Dennis
The look: Partly cloudy brown body topped by a small beige head
In long: The nose has a lot of this big brown stuff.  Unmistakably lager and this beer is not lacking is the cereals department.  Also quite spicy on the nose.  In mouth the beer is lively and the carbonation is a bit aggressive.  The first flavour that came to me was spicy roasted almonds.  Strong notes of black pepper.  If black pepper is not used in this beer than it is one of the most peppery unpeppered beer Ive had.  A lot of chewy cereals with round and smooth caramel.  Whole-wheat bread and almond cake sensation.  A little brown sugar but overall really not too sweet.  This is a rather pleasant beer in a style that is under-represented in North-America.  I just read the ratebeer description here that says that this beer is a collaboration of Tomme Arthur and Tonya Something of Something Brewing.  Good for them.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

1364,"2009-07-17",3.5,"Pours clear dark brown with a 3 finger creamy tan head that has great retention and leaves nice lacing for about half of the glass. Aroma is mild coffee, planty hops, wheat bread, a little caramel and just a hint of roast, doughy right bread, aroma is overall pretty weak though. Flavor is coffee, roast, bittersweet chocolate, burnt sugar, light bitter hops, planty hops, a little straw, roasted mixed nuts, fresh wheat grain and toasted white bread. Finish is planty hops, chocolate, bitter hops, white bread and a nice, crisp lager yeast fade. Palate is medium to light bodied with a very active, but not too sharp carbonation, creamy entry and neutral, but fizzy finish. Good stuff overall. Seems like they just took a stout recipe, threw in some german hops and lagered it. Its alot less sweet, more bitter and more roasty than any dunkel I can remember having.

A little caramelized sugar and even a hint of smoke.  Finishes very crisp with a nice balancing hop bitterness that keeps it from getting too sweet.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a bit of stickiness and a good bit of fizzy effervescent carbonation.

Very malty overall, with a rich sweetness that makes it drink like a bigger bock beer than it is.   I would almost call it a doppelbock in the malt department, but the steinbier thing has given it a malt profile that is truly unique and intriguing.   Dark red-brown in color with a thick light beige head that leaves a lasting slick after a few minutes.   The aroma is sweet and malty with a smooth lager character, caramel, burnt sugars, licorice, and light smoke.   The flavor is squarely malt driven and sweet with caramel, some chocolate, burnt marshmallows, dried fruit, light smoke, and a light spicy hop bitterness.   Medium-full bodied with medium-low carbonation.   I liked this beer because of the cool malty flavors, but couldnt help but with it was a little drier or hoppier for balance.

1364,"2009-05-24",3.6,"A vigorous pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces an almost three-finger thick, amber tinged, tan colored head.  The beer is a dark amber, brown color that shows a clearish, bright cherry hue when held up to the light.  The aroma has a full, malty, caramelized (very much so actually) note that is quite a bit more distinct than I was expecting.  This has an almost fruity caramel not to it that sort of reminds me of something like cotton-candy or marshmallows.  There is a backdrop of toasty, bread-crust like and biscuit leaning maltiness.

This has quite a spicy, herbal hop note to it along with a clean, biting bitterness.  The malt, while distinct, is almost secondary to the hop character; this is quite a departure from the nose.  The beer might be a bit too cold (the low to mid 40s), but when warmed it becomes more creamy in texture.  This is still quite hoppy though, but that fruity-caramel / caramelized cotton candy note becomes more noticeable in the flavor.  The beer almost has a sort of roasted character to it; it is a touch sharp, with a faint hint of roasted character, even a touch of coffee like notes, but not really roasted.  This definitely has a toasted malt edge to it that picks up lots of biscuit character in the finish.

In the end this is quite malt focused, even if I cant quite decide if the initial hop focus in the flavor was distracting or intriguing.  This is quite a tasty beer and the unique notes, presumably from the stoning process, makes this that much more interesting to try.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
1364,"2009-05-22",3.8,"Bottle. Pours deep ruby brown, slight head. Aroma is mild caramel, lightly sweet, some minor spicy notes. Flavor is wonderful. Rich caramel flavors, mild touches of roastiness, some slight burnt malt flavors, not too sweet, lightly bitter earthy hops. Malt flavors have rawness and depth. Mild bitterness and roasty flavors lingering in the background. I seriously love this beer. A very complex lager, reminiscent of traditional old world central and eastern European styles. Wish there were more out there like this.","San Francisco, California, USA","asedzie"
1364,"2009-05-20",2.9,"Bomber. Pours a dark, lightly hazy mahogany color. Chestnut tinted translucency shows when the beer is backlit. A medium sized, foamy, khaki colored head settles to a splotchy film with a substantial edge. A soapy wash mostly rejoins the body, just a few spots remaining behind, holding on for dear life. The nose hints at a mild infection, estery yeast and hints of band-aid mucking up a pretty nice mix of underlying chocolate malt, dark fruit, and hazelnut. Hints of earthy hops nearly get lost in the plasticy scent. Flavors show the infection as well, band-aid overtones fouling an otherwise tasty mix of dry cocoa, vanilla, dark caramel, and nuts. Medium-light in body, overly carbonated,  and too dry for the style, even the palate feels the ill effects of this brews disappointing condition. Its still drinkable, as the infe tion hasnt fully taken over, but it is still a letdown. Too bad, because this seems like it cold be a top tier dunkel.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Overall, some really nice things going on in this one with the mild malt richness, the hazelnut notes are amazing, and nice initial palate, not to mention a head that lasts for a lager.  But the light chalkiness and mineral note at the end create only a good beer, not great.  Still, very nice for a dunkel and certainly very drinkable.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"
1364,"2009-05-07",2.8,"From a 22oz Bottle.  Mostly transparent, mahagony brown body with a finger of small bubbled, fizzy ivory foam.  Clean, malty aromas of toasted bread and a hint of raisin fruits.  Moderate melanoidin character with some fainter caramel notes.  Medium light bodied, moderately carbonated mouthfeel with a soft, malty texture.  Flavors of bread crust and a slight raisiny sweetness up front, but it gives way to a harsh, chalky, minerally dryness mid-palate.  The hop bitterness is accentuated by an upleasant minerally harshness that interupts the malt character that seemed very inviting from the nose.  Finishes dry, with the unpleasant minerally bitterness lingering on the palate.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Hazy, thick very opaque dark brown color, thin light tan head that clears quickly to a thin layer.  Thick, chewy, semi sweet malty nose- notes of caramel, toffee, toasted dark bread.

Tons of malt- heavy on the bittersweet dark fruit, molasses, pumpernickel and dark bread, and some grainy yeast notes, and some faint hints of liquid smoke.

Pours cola colored brown with small head that disappears completely within moments.  Nose is weak to nonexistent, with a suggestion of musty caramel.

Its watery, with not much exciting going on.","Glendale, Arizona, USA","yemenmocha"
