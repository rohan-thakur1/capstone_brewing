3695,"2016-02-03",4.4,"On tap @ Csakajósör - Slightly hazy, deep reddish amber colour, large, stable beige head, fine lacing. Hoppy and toffee nose with some lemon zest, biscuit, touch of honey. Taste is syrupy sweet with a lot of caramel, dried fruits, peach, grapefruit and decent citrussy and resinous hop bitterness. Medium body and carbonation, sticky mouthfeel, long bitter finish. Excellent IPA with astonishing amounts of hops, signature brew.","Budapest, HUNGARY","pityu"

3695,"2014-12-04",4.2,"On tap. Deep amber body, white head. Both the aroma and the taste have huge citrusy notes, pine, caramel and some toast. The aftertaste is a bit more piney than what the aroma suggests. I cant really get the maple syrup, but I dont mind, its still awesome.","Budapest, HUNGARY","kapusil"
