Trying a faro on draft gives me a different perspective on this elusive style. ts not something I would choose to drink all the time. However it does let you do a side by side comparison with the ""before"" and ""after"" effects of aging (plus a generous helping of sugar).

Aroma / Appearance - The caramel bronze base retains no head and hardly any carbonation. Oaky sweet candy bars rise in the air like the tasting room of a sweet shop. The sourness is present but at this point very muted.

Flavor / Palate - Malted iced tea with a scoop of pure sugar remind me of Southern iced tea. This is almost as cloying as a Lindemans ""lambic"" minus the fruity aspects. One sample was enough for me before moving on to some of the finished products.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The flavor is very lemony, but also earthy and the sugar seems to be of a sort of brown varietal. This is not overly sweet but does the sweet and sour balancing act about as well as any other Faro I had in Belgium. At no point did it seem cloying or oversweet and it allowed for the earthiness of the lambic to play in as much as the sugar.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

Mildly sweet candi sugar aroma, tempering but not elimination the lactic acid tartness. Flavor retains some of the tartness, but sugar definitely is the primary flavor.

2008-03-05. Dark headless amber body is mostly still. Aroma is mild, hints at the juicy fruitiness of the flavour, overall it is a bit to subtle to dissect right now.  Flavour has an interesting fruit character, tangy apple juice, light sourness. Interestingly the sourness becomes the most sharp in the aftertaste and the finish. Lightly musty malts make occasional interjections. Fairly well balanced, it has few flavours that stick out but what is there is well blended and balanced. Juicy apples return, somewhat sweeter this time. Different somehow than the other faros that I have had on this trip,better blended, less of the musty lambic character. Surprisingly not sour for Cantillon! But of course as soon as I wrote that down I got a brief sharp lemon seed sour note that mellows quickly. (7+) The sourness seems to increase with the speed of consumption, particularly near the end of the glass. A slow sipper would this find it much milder than a faster drinker. Average palate is still, and suits the beer nicely. Greater carbonation might lighten the palate to its detriment.

The alcohol content is so low it makes it easy to drink, and they are excellent summer heat or daytime drinking beers. The same is also true because the faro is relatively sweet. Very drinkable.

2237,"2004-10-04",3.3,"Faro truly is an aquired taste. A taste that I have yet to aquire. Faro is unblended lambic in which caramel and candy sugar is added during bottling time. I believe that Cantillon uses 1 1/2 year old lambic when making this one. I sampled this at Spinnekopke in Brussels, Belgium. 

Brown.

Sugars overpowering the ""lambicness"" in the nose. 

Flat (to style). Overwhelming sweetness. I expected sweet, but not this sweet. The style, at this point, is not for me. Still though, with the rarity of this beer these days, I think Ill try it again the next chance I get.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
2237,"2004-07-14",4.7,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2012 The below sensorial experiences describe the beer as it was served in different locations (unfortunately missing Moeder Lambic St. Gilles in 2009). But it would not be enough to describe additional factors: its my beer to go when sitting at Moeder Lambic, its one of the most drinkable beers I know, its light and refreshing, it offers layers of complexity. As a Faro, it couldnt get better.2011-09-21, at Moeder Lambic, Fontainas, 8-5-8-4-16=41The keg of Faro is supplied directly by CantillonThe aroma seems to highlight cellar smells this time, cheesy, feety. The mouthfeel is smooth, the balance of sweetness and acidity (mild) is perfect, the cellar and Brett character is elegant and wonderful; there is a light touch of lemon; pleasant fruity astringency in the final. Excellent.2011-09-04, at Moeder Lambic, Fontainas, 7-5-8-4-15=39Cloudy dark amber color, with a giant creamy head. Aroma of malt, of old, maybe some dust, and brown sugar. Sweetish mouthfeel, but it doesnt cover the character from the Gueuze. Its not the first time I had a Faro at Moeder Lambic, and its always good.2004-06-12, just prepared this morning by Jean at the brewery, with a 1½ year old lambic and sugar, 8-4-7-4-14=37Hazy dark amber color. Nice aroma, reminiscent of vin cuit (apples and pears cooked for a looong time), and caramel. Very sweet, covering pretty much the sourness; easily (dangerously) drinkable!","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

2237,"2004-06-09",4.2,"Sampled from a bottle blended two days earlier at the brewery and brought home to Denmark by my Cantillon supplier Jacob Lövenlund - Thanks a lot :-) Pour an unclear brown beer with a red gleam and no head. Little sourness in the aroma but sweet and sugary in the middle. Quite mild. Flavor is sweet, dry and woody with obvious notes of grapefruit and brown sugar. Nice sourness from the wild fermentation behind the sweetness. Reminds me of a Flemish Sour Ale, just sweeter. An excellent and very complex beer and a great surprise, I didnt think Faro could be so tasty...!!","Brooklyn, Alabama, USA","Jeppe"
2237,"2004-04-06",3.9,"Made the night before, sampled at the Cantillon Open Brewing Day March 2004. Deep amber, no head or condition. Sweet caramel and tart lambic notes in the nose. Manages a good balance of caramel sweetnes and dry woody tartness in the mouth, without overstratching itself either way. Long refreshing sweet finish with a faintly lambic dryness. A good way to start the day.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
2237,"2004-03-28",4.1,"Brown/orange coloured. This is by far the best faro I have had. It is not as cloyingly sweet and unbalanced as they most often are. Flavour of grapes and grapefruit with a little sugar. Very well balanced and pleasant.","København, DENMARK","Hildigöltur"
2237,"2004-03-13",3.3,"The aroma is very sour. The color is dark orange and it has no head. The flavor is sweet and sour of grapefruit and with a dry woody end - a lovely flavor. The best Faro I have tried.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
2237,"2003-08-13",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 27, 2010 Sampled July 2010 at Cantillon
The beer arrives with a hazy, amber gold color and some large bubbled, pale looking foam that is wispy and clings to the inner ring of my glass.  This smells of juice somehow; a mix of pineapple, grapefruit and perhaps even a touch of apple juices are each noticeable.  The Lambic funkiness contributes notes of urea, and an earthy mustiness, while the finish smells of fresh cut wood, and a spiciness as well as something that reminds me of musty cork.

As a Faro should, the beer tastes fairly sweet and it even tastes of pineapple juice and a touch of grapefruit.  This last is not as noticeable as the Faro is only lightly tart at this point.  There is not quite enough lactic tartness to really cut through / balance the sweetness, but there is definitely some tartness to this beer.  Musty cork flavors, ro more likely oaky notes add a touch of bit to help balance out the sweetness and there is some spicy oak character here as well.  The body makes this light and quaffable, despite the sweetness that has been added.

This has quite a mellow sweetness for a Faro; it manages to be quite nicely balanced and is definitely very tasty.  The light sweetness brings out a refreshing quality that is different from the same character that one sees in a dry Lambic.  I would prefer more acidity to this brew, but I am really finding the ample fruitiness here to be quite interesting and enjoyable.
Sampled at Cantillon 2001
3.9 8/4/8/4/15
This strangely enough tasted similar to a lightly sweetened herbal tea.  Quite flat, a bit astringent, and with a  pleasing herbal and flowery character to it.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
2237,"2003-07-02",3.0,"This is a true Faro, that is, not available in bottles, though a guided tour (4 E$ with 3 lambic samples) of the brewery will give you the opportunity to try this one.  They add brown sugar to a 1.5 year old unblended lambic.  The harsh Cantillon Gueuze makes for an interesting base and the added sweetness helps smooth out the rough edges of the base lambic.","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","dhurtubise"
2237,"2003-04-13",3.9,"Hazy gold - apricot colour. Slight head, transparant-white. Nose of raisins, grape, sugar, benzene, sulphur. Taste gives raisins again, sweet muscat wine, sugary retronasal. Slick, oily mouthfeel; thick bodied because of the syrup. Nice balance between the sweetness and the lambic tartness. If I have to drink sweet beer, I want this.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
2237,"2003-01-05",3.8,"Draught. Murky light brown. Aroma is moderately yeasty (barnyard), lightly malty (light bread), with notes of peach and brown sugar. Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic. Medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation. Not surprisingly one of the better balanced Cantillons turns out to be the sugared one.  Whereas many faros are syrupy sweet messes, this turns out to still be sour enough to resemble true lambic.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2237,"2002-12-08",4.0,"Sampled draught at Akkurat, Stockholm, Sweden.
Dark orange, hazy. Fruity lactic vinegar aroma. Complex with balanced acidity. Usually faro is just sweet and dumbed down. but Cantillon is so sour to start with that their faro is like other traditional brouwers lambic. Really good!","Tyresö, SWEDEN","omhper"
