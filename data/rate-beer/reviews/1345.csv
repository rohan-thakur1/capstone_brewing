1345,"2012-03-01",3.3,"Tap. Light to moderate malt notes of roasted and caramel, light herbs and cooked orange for the hops, faint dough for the yeast, with hints of brown sugar and wood. Head is average size, frothy, off-white with fair lacing and is moslty diminishing. Color is muddy reddish brown. Flavor starts faintly sweet and lightly acidic, then finishes lightly acidic. Palate is light to medium, watery with a lively carbonation and a lightly drying finish. A well made beer, fits the Scottish Ale style, but flavor just lacks in this type of beer.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"
1345,"2011-08-22",3.8,"Tap at brewpub.  Very tasty 3,9% abv ale.  I didnt have many beers of that style but the rich malty flavors, with just distant and loveable sweeter notes, are really surprising.  The delicate and delightful floral and peppery hopping seemed very refined.  Ouf...  Them...  Again.  God!","Terrebonne, Quebec, CANADA","bedainedebiere"

1345,"2009-08-26",3.4,"Draught.  At Dieu du Ciel during Mondial 2009 - day 1.  Cloudy amber with a diminishing foamy/creamy beige head.  Simple aroma, light cereal grain and sweet caramel malt, a little floral, if not perfumey.  The taste is less sweet, a little dry herbal bitterness balances it out nicely, hardly any alcohol presence at all.  Sticky, light, weakly carbonated mouthfeel, quick-finishing, leaves a slightly earthy aftertaste - would be easier to drink in quantity than most of the Scottish Ales I have tried.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

1345,"2008-06-09",3.5,"In short: A richly malted earthy original Scottish Ale.  
How: Tap at brewpub
The look: Cloudy dark ruby body with a medium beige head
In long: Interesting malt bill with a graham cookies and rye bread flavour.  Some dried fruits in caramel.  Even a little side of fruit salad with a light cherry sourness.   I particularly enjoyed the earthy notes, birch trees and tree bark flavours.  It was my second First Communion and I really enjoyed both of them.  This last one was a really satisfying pint of beer and the first one was even more fun with the farts noises on the wooden church bench.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
