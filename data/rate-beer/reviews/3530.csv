3530,"2016-12-09",3.8,"Dark ruby color withh a small head. Aroma of cocoa. Dark caramel, berry, and cocoa flavor. Light earthy hop. Dry as a bone. Medium bosy.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
3530,"2016-10-23",3.7,"Draft pour on tap at Shorts East Side (Iowa City, IA). Pours a nice deeper brownish ruby hue, a decent haziness, remarkable darker glow throughout with frothy tannish head atop that stays as a solid layer, nice lacing and retention. Aromas are a bit toasty, carmelized, and almost roasty. Initial is dry, bitter, with subtle darker malt middle. Bready, biscuity, with subtle oat and dry grainy appeal. Decent bitterness, fairly crushable darker Mild drinks really nice. Some brown malt flourishes, nutty and carmelized, subtle oatmeal cookie crunch. Backend and finish really smooth, dry, tasty stuff. A really pleasant Mild with a dark touch, harkening back to memories of Surlys original Mild. Delicious.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3530,"2016-08-05",1.9,"I could not finish the sampler glasses of the Workmans Comp (or the nitrus added version) from what was probably the first batch of this beer offered for sale. My impression was ""musty"" or ""moldy"".. Certainly tainted with undesirable characteristics. 

I was flabberghasted when about 8 to 10 months later, this same beer won a gold as some beer tasting event.

I have since sampled (and even finished one glass) of what I will call the new Workmans Comp. While it is better, it is still far from being a good beer. No biscuit, no toffee, no coffee, no silky mouthfeel. Often tends to run toward that musty taste that was so prominent in the first batch. I have since run into at least two other beer products from this brewer where the musty taste was prominent making me think that the brewer cant tell the difference, or believes this is a good taste to have.

I will not drink it again.","Cedar Rapids, Iowa, USA","Beertender001"
3530,"2016-08-04",3.3,"I like to thank every American brewery that %ttempts a Mild Ale. Its a great style. I wish it werent as heavy as it is--the best milds are mid-3% abv, not mid-4%--but all the same, they extract some rich flavors out of a fairly light beer. Light brown color. Good roasted aroma, moderate bitterness, chocolate resonances. Decent. (on tap at Newbo market, Cedar Rapids, IA)","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
3530,"2016-06-07",3.5,"On tap at El Bait Shop, Des Moines. Comes reddish brown with a decent off-white head. Aroma of malt , chocolate, and coffee. Taste is similar. Found it very easy to drink. Sessionable.","Lansing, Kansas, USA","RobertDale"
3530,"2016-02-01",3.8,"Poured on tap. Dark amber and walnut brown with thin white head. Aroma has a wonderful burnt toffee and nuttiness quality. Caramel, coffee, and chocolate flavors shine nicely with some faint earthy and grass in the finish. Delicious beer on a winters day.","Iowa, USA","DuchessOfIowa"
3530,"2015-11-27",4.3,"Tap at Chameleons in Mt. Vernon. Deep Brown colored body with a yellowish tan head. Nose of lightly toasted coffee and a little bit of dough. There is also milk chocolate. Flavors of milk chocolate mixed with smoked black tea are present. There is also a sweetish pancake fnish. Overall this is very all solid smooth and well made.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"
3530,"2015-11-14",3.6,"Sampled from the tap at El Bait Shop. Pours a near clear amber brown with a light brown head that dissipates to the edges and laces. Aroma has light roasted malts with bread and slightly dark grains supporting. Flavor has light roasted and dark grains with a bit of coffee underlying.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"

3530,"2014-12-21",2.8,"Growler from the brewer (thanks Chris). I found it to be like a mediocre homebrew--that kind of sour, not everything is clean perhaps, flavor.","Mount Vernon, Iowa, USA","GJF"
3530,"2014-09-16",3.8,"On Draught
Pours a very dark red with a good head and decent lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is mildly sweet with a light caramel and toffee thing happening. Its got some decent roast to it too, almost like a light roasted coffee thing happening. 

The flavor is malt forward with a nice mild blanking bitterness. The roastiness is nice in a sort of nutty, sort of coffee kind of way. The beer is mildly sweet with a light chocolate character. 

I dig it a lot & I cant wait to try other stuff from these fine folks.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
3530,"2014-08-21",3.9,"Draft at brewery. Pours clear red-brown (""thats garnet"" my wife informs me. ""Wtf is garnet?"" She holds the glass to the light, taps it and says ""this is.""). On the nose this reminds me of a mild porter, but in my mouth is an explosion of berries and toffee. Like a cobbler. My kind of beer - sessionable, interesting, tasty. I mention berries to my wife and she looks at me like Im crazy, so maybe it is mostly biscuit and toffee to most palates, but whatever. Light body, smooth texture. Overall: one of the best milds Ive had - really enjoyed this. Ordering a pint of this once my ticking is done for the night.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
