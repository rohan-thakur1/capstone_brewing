Dont let the price deceive you on this oneit is one of (if not the) cheapest ice ciders in the storethis is a cider of exemplary quality that can go toe-to-toe with cryo-concentrated ice ciders.

Thick body, a bit lacking in flavor up front, with grape skins, apple sauce, spice, hibiscus, and pomegranate in the mid-palate and finish. Excellent balance and easily drinkable.

142,"2006-04-01",3.7,"From taking to the rep, this is made with Spartanand Liberty apples. Golden coloured, with with pleasant spiced apple sauce qualities. Sweet apple juice in mouth, with warming alcohol. Quaint and decent. At Salon des Vins et Spiritueux de Montréal, March 25 2006.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Lubiere"
142,"2006-03-24",3.8,"Bu au Salin du vin de Montréal 06., bien que jai une bouteille de 375 ml. Bonne arome de pomme frais, un peu sucré et elle ne goût pas aussi fort qindiqué.","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","Quevillon"
142,"2005-08-23",4.0,"Bottle.  Light golden yellow in colour, some alcohol legs on the glass.  The aroma was of sugar glazed apple pie, cloves, cinnamon, slightly sweet with some alcohol coming through.  The flavour was more or less the same as the aroma alongs with some nuts and pie crust, some alcohol.  Sweet mouthfeel, warming feeling.  Finishes with a lingering apple sweetness, slightly tart.  Quite nice.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","radiomgb"
142,"2005-06-10",3.8,"Sampled at le Mondial de la bière 2005. Sweet aroma and flavor of baked apples, maybe apple sauce too. Its sweet but not cloying. Liquorous texture. Good stuff.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","beerbuzzmontreal"
142,"2005-06-06",3.8,"Bright clear golden yellow, moderate viscosity factor. Ripened apple flesh nose with more alcohol than most melting with the dry, almost nutty component. The lightest sour touch ensures minimal drinkability while the apples take on the palate, bold, flavorful, alcoholic and skinny. Good example.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
142,"2005-05-22",4.3,"Gorgeous clear gold with soft rosey-pink shine; no head of course. Soft, delicate apple smell, interspecked with alcohol and an aroma of peach skin. Sweetish, faint mint and sage flavours, obvious apple, and mild touch of bitterish-sourish-tart, but all quite subdued. Explosive MF, titillating and velvety at the same time. Respectable alcohol impression. This is absolutely great, and yet at the opposite end of my usual favoured cider (West-country and South-Wales farmyard ciders). Its delicate and powerful at the same time. Lubière, merci, this is just great.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
142,"2005-05-16",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 21, 2005 From a flashy yellow-gold emerges apples sitting on hay...Sweetness is not overdone for this ice cider, but the mouthfeel is still agreeably full...Alcohol is well-contained, and does not splash in the end, thankfully...Well-balanced sweetness and alcohol, and beautiful apple peel flavors offering a mature tart zing underneath...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
142,"2004-06-12",3.6,"Clean, fresh, sweet apples. Late summer in the orchard. Bees buzz around. Clear golden sweet, mildly alcoholic. Very tasty dessert cider. Bottle (sampled at Mondial 2004).","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
142,"2004-02-01",3.5,"(375ml bottle) Interesting take-off on the Ice Wine industry - using other fruit to produce a sweeter and more fortified beverage. Pours a deeper apple juice colour and a light motor oil consistency. Nose of sweet apples, pear, honey and slight white wine. Initial sweetness and slight alcohol gives way to a mild, tart finish. Delicious and agreeable. Pairs nicely with a strong cheddar cheese.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
