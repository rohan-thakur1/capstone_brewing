Deep reddish-brown with a small off-white head leaving some lacing. Aroma is nothing to be surprised of when you know Pannepot and Pannepeut. This one might have a bit more of a raisins presence. Theres also the usual Pannepot Belgiumness, perfect spices mix, molasses, dried fruits, banana notes and a bit of alcohol. Taste is also raisins forward - not cloying though - with medium sweetness, a bit of alcohol heat, nice spicy mix, molasses and dried fruits. Medium ti full body. Moderate to medium carbonation.

2339,"2015-04-12",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2015 Limited edition of Pannepot in 75 cl bottles, with no sugar or yeast added for refermentation. Very dark mahogany colour, nearly black, under a creamy, dense, yellowish light beige, stable head; looks more or less the same as the regular Pannepot. Very pleasant and complex aroma of caramel, fried egg, beef, hazelnuts, bourbon, coriander, sherry, thyme, cold coffee touch, bayleaf, cinnamon. Soft sweetish onset, dried fruits, soft carbonation, full and creamy mouthfeel, caramelly and lightly nutty maltiness, more fluffy and perhaps somewhat thinner body than the regular, dry spicy effect of the used coriander seed and (more subtly) cinnamon and thyme; spicy hop accent in the finish along with warming, bourbon-like alcohol, a lot of lingering nutty maltiness and the drying, resinous coriander effect persisting as well. Has a strikingly stronger, beefy and meaty protein character than the regular, so I guess one can argue this has evolved into a different beer with its own character, making it all the more interesting. Held its own well in a comparative tasting with different vintages of the regular Pannepot - in fact, three out of the five tasters (including myself) even slightly preferred this over the regular.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
