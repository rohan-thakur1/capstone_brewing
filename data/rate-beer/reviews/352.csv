352,"2017-06-15",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 17, 2017 37,5 cl bottle, served in a tumbler. Vintage: 2015/2016. Poured clear golden amber with a small half finger off white head. Loads of carbonation in glass. Aroma: barnyard, goat, blue cheese, citrus, menure, basement, leather, hay, rotten leaves in the autumn woods. Taste: sour but not overwhelming, citrus, oak, dry vinous tannine, granny smith apples, tart, vinegar, bitter, blue cheese, barnyard, clove, earth, cherries, leather, ginger. Very complex with a very sweet explosion of different tastes going on every time when you sip it. Love it how you can still taste the oak barrels and the bitterness in this piece of art, very champagne-like. I am drinking this how it is supposed to be drunk, at room temperature and loving every divine sip of it. Medium body with a long dry and sour bittersweet finish.

This brew from Tilquin is sinfully drinkable. Gold color and a frothy, white head. Aroma is equally champagne-like with bright yeast esters, sour apple, and stone fruit. Flavor is damn cider-like (just more sour) with more subtle notes of grape must, citrus, barnyard, and wood. Finish is long and dry. This brew lands a perfect balance between massively funky and beautifully approachable.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Pouring a light honey gold with a sense head of foam that lasts for ages.

This Geuze from an underrated and quite new blenderie that is growing in popularity has an intensely funky aroma: earthy with a lightly peppery lemon tartness.

Its got an insanely soft rounded mouthfeel very nice. 

The taste is acidic, cork, light must/funk, lemon drops, a bit salty. Really interesting stuff that I think would go great with a salad or seafood.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
352,"2016-02-23",4.9,"37,5 cl bottle. The labelling is very classy. Nice pop at the opening! Golden hazy pour with quite a thick head but like any gueuze, short lasting. Aroma is funky and zesty lemons, apples, light vinegar. There is a massive gunflint mineral aroma that I have not yet found on any other gueuze (it is not as present in Boon, Cantillon, Lindemans, 3 Fonteinen lambics which are used to make this). It is rather sweet for a gueuze, very round and balanced. Dry and sour finish, but very harmonic. The palate is very full with lots of very thin bubbles. Overall it is highly drinkable and incredibly tasty! I only leave one point just in case I find any beer better than this!","Rennes, FRANCE","ChtiBreizh"

A hint of oaky and woody notes as well. Lactic upfront, slightly astringent and then pretty damn tart. Im not sure if the correct word is tart or sour, but it feels more tart to me. Nice zinginess on the palate, making it relatively easy to drink. Solid and spot on dryness. The aftertaste really linger forever. Fruity, slightly puckering and tart.

But he persisted and see, here was the first result, since May 2011, a geuze initially only made with Lindemans, Boon and Cantillon lambics. Cream white, stable head, hazy orange blonde colour. The aroma has all the funkiness, esteriness and complexity you would expect from a true geuze, with hay, gooseberry, wood, green apple, wine vinegar, sweat, sour cream, barnyard... Mellow fresh sour taste with refreshing lemon touch, quite soft mouthfeel with less sharp carbonation than usual for the style, tart, complex enough and finishing long and dry with woody hints.

352,"2014-10-13",3.5,"BE CAREFUL WHEN OPENING THIS! I untwisted the cage and set it on my desk. Before I could even touch the cork, it shot off with a loud POP and hit my ceiling.

This is a review of the 2013-2014 bottle.

Appearance: Hazy darker shade of orange with a light white film of bubbles on the surface. No lacing.

Smell: I get this odd smell of popcorn. It is followed by a familiar musty cellar smell. Kudos for having something new...never smelled popcorn in beer before.

Taste: Strong sour apple flavor, like green Jolly Ranchers. Quickly this is taken over by funky old house...if that were a flavor. Then I get some of the popcorn.

Mouthfeel: Very dry and tart feeling. A sipper. 

Overall: Its a very good Gueuze that already tastes like it has a good deal of age on it. While its possible to drink it fresh, It has a ""best before"" date of 08/01/2024 on the bottle. I will revisit this beer somewhere down the line when it has aged out some more. That ""popcorn"" flavor and aroma is very strange. It doesnt taste bad, it just tastes odd.

Juicy, tart, sharp flavor. Watermelon, golden kiwi. Hard water minerals and soft limestone gravel. Gorgeous balance and subtlety. Bitter, whitish wooden notes become apparent with time. There is no stark, violent action to this one, but the quiet elegance of its bright fruit and cloudy funk is sufficient for an impressive experience.

Puckering palate whisks away moisture but is not overpoweringly sour. The mid to late palate has a mild hollowness to it. The finish shows high acidity with pineapple, lactic acid, goat cheese.

OK, I figured Id do this one a precursor to the Quetsche, and kinda forgot that I had reviewed it before. But its so good, theres not much harm in me reviewing it again!

Im fairly convinced I can smell and taste the Cantillon lambic component in this.

Dosent seem any stronger than your average 5% gueuze, which is nice.I cant even imagine starting a Belgian lambic brewery and this being your first offering. Classy and very authentically done.

Aromas of big lemon/lime zest, green apple, pear, white grape, oak, clove, hay, straw, grass, leather, pepper, white vinegar, musty funk, and yeast earthiness.

Moderate earthy/fruity tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon/lime zest, green apple, pear, white grape, hay, straw, grass, oak, clove, pepper, leather, musty funk, white vinegar, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Incredible complexity and balance of fruity/funk yeast oak barrel flavors; with a great balance of malt/acidity with zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very crisp, smooth, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish.

352,"2013-12-17",3.6,"I had this on draught while in Brussels, it was fantastic.
Vintage 2010-2011

Pours a murky golden with a withering finger of white foam. The beer is not much to look at. Smells good and funky with lemon, manure, grass, vitamin, and some hints of peppery sharpness. Smells like its gonna be tart!

Tart with lemons, and some baking soda character. Nice and dry with a mouth watering finish. Sharp carbonation brings out the lemony sourness and the remaining effervescence leaves a nice medicinal flavor mixed with a good funk. A little much on the alka-seltzer quality at times for me. 

Overall a good beer, better when I was in Brussels at a bar (but what beer isnt?). I am hesitant to purchase again given the price tag. Maybe grab a bottle and do a good sized gueuze tasting here in a few. Maybe a couple for the cellar, see how they mature.

The flavor is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately to heavily acidic. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, dry, long finish with light bitterness. Surely a new favorite among Lambics.

Lots of musty fruit - apples, berries, grapes. Medium vinegar and oak. Taste is sour lemons upfront, then some fruity malt flavor and back to more sourness that follows through into a long-lasting finish. Fairly dry. Solid pucker. Nice tannic oak flavor. Mouthfeel is a light sparkle on top of a relatively full body for a lambic. This is an excellent beer, and its wonderful to have another traditional lambic brewer available in local stores.

352,"2013-01-22",4.1,"Reviewed 12/31/2012. Thanks to Momar42 for all three gueuzes (and the kriek surprise afterwards!) This was part of the gueuze showdown, pitting Tilquins gueuze against the juggernaut duo known as Cantillon Gueuze and Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze. Part of a 750mL bottle poured into a Cantillon tulip. Notes from last nights Skins/Cowboys game.

A: Pours a cloudy dark amber color. The head is a one finger white shade, with the best texture and retention of the three.

S: Tons of tartness, a lesser white wine-esque fruitiness, and some buried earthy funk. The most seemingly sour of the three.

T: First thing that comes through initially is the combination of pear/apple esters and white wine tartness. The tart sourness breaks through more aggressively through the midtaste, while the finish is mild brett funk. Out of the three, this was the most sour, the least earthy - and the least subtle. Certainly a nice beer, however.

M: Super dry and puckering. Lots of carbonation, too. It lacks the delicate touch of the Cantiloon/3F gueuzes, though its softer than, say, a run of the mill Flemish red.

O: Its a nice sour ale. I wouldnt call it beginner friendly at all, though, due to the tartness. I would point fans of Flanders sours to this one, however. Shame it had compete against the two titans of the style - even though it came in third in the gueuze showdown, I reckon it would be superior to any other gueuze on the market (not from Cantiloon or 3F, that is).","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Fucky with lemony vinegar,  something that instantly reminds me of what I smell at the Yoga Loft - some soothing yet slightly pungent herbal fumes, orange oil from a freshly twisted rind, earthen dankness like the corners of an old rotting farm house. A sit gives it some borderline floralness. Very tasty and thankfully not brutally harsh... maybe another day. Drying and mouthwatering with some punishing vinegar mouth bath, medium cheese stuff, lemon, tart, dry grass, brett (I bet Im the only one to discover this....), it is possible there is a berry touch.. possibly.

A monster of an Oude Gueuze, ive been drinking liters of this one and fall in love again every time.
Bottle (37.5cl) @ Fermento beer shop, Roma Via Tigré very similar to the 75cl bottle, but with clearer appearence (strange for an oude gueuze) and with less pronounced yeast and brett notes, the yeast deposit was really smaller than the bigger bottle and the overall balance was less pleasurable but still a very good beer.

Managed to have this in June 2011 (when it was fresh, good but way underdone) in Sept 2011 (when it had turned to a strong sour gueuze) and in May 2012 when it had matured into a smooth complex sour. Hazy orange pour with a fizzy white head. Body is improved by the fact that it is unfiltered. Tastes of multiple fruits such as peach, cherry, orange, apricot, apple, grapefruit and red raspberry. End result is a well blended very sour gueuze. Smooth in flavor, though the sour bite remains strong through the finish. After a year of this first vintage it still has a lot of character and should continue to age well. Update: Having the 2011 once again in November 2012. Big difference this time.

352,"2012-04-09",4.0,"(Une belle bouteille de 75 cl, à consommer de préférence avant le 22 janvier 2021) Je suis à verser le premier verre de ce liquide à la robe dorée/orangée et je mattarde un instant au texte de létiquette.  On peut y lire : «La Gueuze Tilquin à lancienne est issue de lassemblage de lambics de 1, 2 er 3 ans mûris en fûts de chêne.  Non filtrée et non pasteurisée, elle est refermentée en bouteille.  Les lambics employés ont été brassés par les brasseries Boon, Lindemans, Girardin et Cantillon.»  Prometteur!  Donc, sur cette robe, une tête qui est a priori énorme et qui semble bien vouloir résister un instant.  Un regard qui permet aussi de constater le fort déplacement des bulles.  Une belle et bonne effervescence, quoi.  Au nez, les parfums sont bien cohésifs sans être expansifs : il y a une légère poussière et certainement un boisé avec des effluves de cuir et des citrons qui saccordent sur le même pas et qui ne tombent jamais dans lexcès.  Au niveau des saveurs, lassemblage des lambics est tout de même gentil pour mes papilles.  Il y a des notes fruitées surettes et acides.  Il y a des microbes et un goût de bois touché par les aléas de lhumidité.  Il y a des notes qui ne sont jamais trop intenses et jamais vinaigrées.  En bouche, cest un liquide qui étonne avec un corps de moyenne densité.  Il y a un apport de bulles qui est juste.  La texture est légèrement huileuse.  Japprécie cet état de fait.  En finale, une tempête asséchante, toute en équilibre avec une complexité certaine.  Facile à boire.  Peut-être un peu trop!","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

In short: A classy, dry and complex citrusy Gueuze that is not too intensely sour/acidic.  Wow!
How: Bottle 750ml.  One of the early bottling from 2011 (1 year + 2 year lambic).  Consumed when approximately 8 months of age
The look: Cloudy blonde body topped by a persistent small white head
In long: Nose is not the most intense but it is all I want from a Gueuze aroma, barnyard, rustic, funk, horse blanket.  Aroma does not indicates much acidity or sourness.  Taste offers a lot of funk and citrus fruits, plenty of hay, grapefruits and lemons acidity, barnyard.  Very dry.  Very classy, mass-market friendly because not too sour or acidic and also very complex to satisfy the Gueuze connoisseur.  As a lambic drinker I used to prefer the most intense examples of the style, but as years pass I am more and more drawn to more classy and easy to drink offerings of the style like this one.  This is clearly one of the top gueuze out there.  A friend proposed to have a blind tasting, but whats the point really, Im sure I would prefer the more tender Stevie Wonder over Andrea Bocelli","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Appearance is a hazy orange with a small white head. Good head retention but no lacing.

Aroma is funky barnyard but there is also some citrus in there notably lemon, orange, and raspberry. There is also a touch of oak.

Taste is quite a bit more citrusy than some of the other gueuzes I have tried. Orange and raspberry are there almost on a level playing field with the barnyard notes. A dry oakiness comes in strong on the finish. Tartness is quite prevalent throughout imparting a lemony character. Finish is dry but not quite as dry and clean as I would have liked.

A soft pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a voluminous, quickly overflowing, four-finger thick, pale tan colored head; this leaves some light, layered lacing on the sides of my glass as it slowly subsides. The beer is a nice amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, bright, pale-amber tinged, full gold color when held up to the light. The aroma has a certain cider like note to it, this is backed by a solid lactic tartness, lots of woody mushroom notes, earthy oak character, a soft musky / sweaty character, piquant urea, some toasted oak notes, a nutty dried straw aroma, and then a solid fruit character in the finish again that also has some pear like notes to it. The aroma is quite complex, with a definite piquancy to it.

My first sip is effervescent, tart, oaky, slightly astringent, and then with a more biting sourness in the finish. The body has some lactic slickness and tannic structure to it, but is well balanced by the bubbly carbonation; it is really hard to find fault with the body, lots of carbonation (which I like in a Gueuze), with ample body for a beer this dry, yet still eminently quaffable. The finish is phenolic, perhaps a hint of medicinal notes, lots of grassy / dried-hay flavors, and a certain bitterness and oaky spiciness is also here. The malt character accentuates the straw like notes, but also provides a rounded wheat-cracker / rustic-white-bread-crumb like character in the middle of each sip. Quite musky, with plastic overtones, perhaps, with lots of sort of medicinal mushroom like flavors, . This does have quite a chewy, oak stave, woody flavor to it; perhaps a bit more than some Lambics, but it is clearly only playing a supporting role here; I wonder if it has to do with the newness of the barrels that this new Gueuze blender is having to use. This has a firmness to it somehow that is accentuated by a mineral, perhaps slightly metallic character, and these get mixed in with a cider like flavor that shows perhaps a touch of oxidation; the oxidation also adds a slightly nutty overtone to the malt / grain character here. Speaking of fruit, there are also some light grapefruit like notes, and at times, perhaps a touch of pear like notes.

I was expecting this to be a significant let down after the fantastic Girardin Black Label that I had last night, but this is certainly holding its own; not as funky, but perfectly complex and actually a bit more balanced than the latter. This is a big improvement over the first vintage (with only two years of Lambic blended) that I had; much more complex, balanced, and characterful, in fact it makes me realize that I over-inflated the previous vintage, but I excuse myself for that one, since I was so excited about there being a new Gueuze blender in town. With the slightly darker coloring, and the slight cider like notes, it seems that this has seen  a bit more oxidation during aging than most modern Gueuze manufacturers, but it is well in line with what I have had in previous years, and luckily is only a light touch; I wonder if it will have any implication on the aging potential of these beers, only one way to find out. I really love Gueuze, that is all.

As I pop the cork off this best by 10/02/2021 375ml bottle I get a waft of raspberries.  A steady pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a two finger thick, somewhat creamy textured, pale tan colored head.  The beer is a pale amber color that shows a bright, clear, orange-tinted, gold hue when held up to the light.  The aroma smells of lactic acid, grapefruit and a touch of cider that is backed by an ample funkiness that provides mushroom notes, phenolic funkiness, fruity oak character, dry woody spicy notes, perhaps a hint of clove even.  The nose has a bright fruitiness to it that makes this distinct compared to other Gueuzes; this adds a nice note and at times I would swear there are some raspberries here.  The nose is quite nice, dry and appetizing smelling, but with a fair amount of complexity; as one should expect of a Gueuze.

The beer has bright sourness to it that manages to be quite in control and suggests at notes of grapefruit.  This is backed by a funkiness that wasnt quite as pronounced as it was in the nose.  There is a fruitiness here in the flavor that again reminds me of raspberries; this might be accentuated by a touch of acetic character that isnt really at flavor threshold levels.  This has a dryness to it that is accentuated by some oak derived astringency and some phenolic character. The body of this beer is just about perfect for a Gueuze, light and refreshing, but with that characteristic slickness and texture to it that keeps this a long way from being watery.  The oak character seems to be a touch spicier and astringent than is usual for a Gueuze; given that this is a new Gueuze blender and that the barrels were newly sourced, that is not at all surprising.  As the beer warms up the woody character / oak gets more distinct and, along with the funkiness, makes me think of woody mushrooms.  The acidity also gets a bit more pronounced, almost sharp, though not quite harsh.

This is a damn good Gueuze already, I cant wait to have one that is a proper blend of 3, 2 and 1 year old Lambics. This definitely has me excited as this particular blend shows a lot of potential; it could use a more muted oak profile and the acidity might be a bit more rounded, but I really like the fruitiness and the funkiness, and even the oak and acidity.  I cant wait to get more vintages of this.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The nose is really yummy but not super complex. Some wood as well. A touch of flowers, dry cracker-like malt, mint and sulfur. The flavor is dry and medium to heavily acidic. Tones of citrus, super dry apple cider, brett, cracker like malt and light wood. Maybe a bit milky. The mouthfeel is tart a fairly tight with a light to medium carbonation.

352,"2011-12-05",4.4,"My Bottom Line :  
Citrus fruit imbued with lactic suggestions pierce this Gueuzes attic dustiness, as fine cereals ride an ebullient effervescence. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A white head of foam floats atop the hazy golden amber.
-This was much more elegant than the Gueuze which preceded it, the HORAL Mega-Blend.
-The mouthfeel was as tight as the best Drie Fonteinens. Damn, this is an impressive beginning!
-Sourness is about as intense as Drie Fonteinen as well. Even if the flavor profile is as classy and cohesive as they come, the pungency of the sourness makes this a sipper (this is much more intense than a Boon Oude Gueuze, for example, which I consider to be beautifully drinkable).

375 ml bottle from Ohtsuki. Nice leather, lemon, slight soap, dust nose. Well integrated. Bright deepngolden, very effervescent, tall, fine head. Well sour flavor, lemony, with leather, salt, and dust. Very crisp and tasty, with quite a bit of sweetness in there as well, but a dry, bitter finish. Straightforward and good. Not the most complex gueuze maybe, but very nice. Very well carbonated.      
Bottle at Chrisos shared by Chriso, 2011. Pretty peach orange to pink color with lace. Huge tangy lemon and lmon zest nose. Yeah! Sweet-and-sour flavor, quite sweet and fruity, actually, maybe too much so, with restrained sourness and reasonably complex. 8/3/7/4/15","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"

The nose is farmyard, lemon, lime and sour green apple. The taste is sour green apple, lemon, lime, pear, ripe sweet red apple, peach and wood, with a dry, tart finish. Great balance and very, very drinkable. Ticks all the boxes this one does. I wouldnt have a problem polishing off a few bottles of this by myself.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"

Full-bodied with a dry mouthfeel and laid-back carbonation. The flavor is fruity and barnyardy. Sour for sure, but yeasty bitterness nearly balances things out.

352,"2011-07-28",3.9,"Always nice to see a new Oude Geuze (a bit of an internal contradiction there). Tilquin is good already, but should improve, since this is an Oude Geuze based only on young and 2 year old lambic. Pierre told me that he had to do this to start getting some of his investments back. Next year however, he WILL be using 3 year old lambic as well, namely the lambic from Cantillon. This first version DOES NOT contain lambic from Cantillon (sorry to all that included notes on the distinguished Cantilon flavours etc :-p) . Still a good Oude Geuze though... even now! nice and mals, just flows inside... mmmm","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","rotjoch"

Palate was medium bodied and a little bit dry with medium carbonation. Flavours were sourness, grapefruit, fruitiness, wood and bitterness. Aftertaste was sour, woody and fruity. A very good mixture of lambics from four sources letting their styles to show and still being original. I hope to be able to try more.","Helsinki, FINLAND","mjs"
352,"2011-07-18",4.1,"750 ml bottle shared at Kans. Thanks! Pours a murky golden orange pour, a frothy bright white head, glowing and well hazed with a good ring, laces ok. Aromas are fresh citrusy oranges, lemons, and vibrant pineapple. Some melon, bread, and dough. Some dry florals are mellow, soft cheese, yogurt. Some light brettiness, some wet oak. Young, gentle funk compliments a vibrant fruity element. Initial is lighter bodied preaching sour lemons and grapefruit, pineapples, and grass. Bread, with soft cheese and yogurt, a touch of a sharp cheesiness cuts in, faint metal, growing citrus and moderate sour fruit element. Its sour, but not acidic, with a good fruity explosion. I dig this, a big fruity sour element, not moving into acidic instead throwing grapefruit, melons, lemons, and good growing sourness, fruit, with a touch of mango, more pineapple really asserts itself. Really nice, some prickly carbonation, jabs of acidity, growing sourness. Mmmmmm. Funk is light, soft, gentle, with just a touch of oak. Some soft cheese and yogurt, playing second fiddle to the fruity sourness for sure. Really nice, wins me over.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

352,"2011-06-27",4.0,"Bottle thanks to bu11zeye. Rating #5100. Marked as best before 11/12/2020. Pours with a hazy golden body with a small white head that fades to a ring and lingers around the side of the glass. Aromas are huge, very funky (a complex and deep funk), white wine, brett, oak. Some horseblanket, honey, esters and florals. Very complex. Flavors are again, complex. Funk, musty, dried stone fruits, lively, bright. Rich wood notes, horseblanket, honeysuckle with balancing tannins. White wine vinous notes. Lively bubbles with decent acidity, bright, and dry. A very nice new Gueuze from a new blender. Leans a bit to the funk side of things over the sharper acidity of a Cantillon or 3Font. A bit like 1882, but clearly its own. Very nice!","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
352,"2011-06-26",4.1,"Short-lived, just off-white head over dullish orange-ochre, well-carbonated gueuze. Citrussy, farmyard odour, flowery as dried flowers or helicrysum; generally quite Cantillon-like, sour apples, touch of sulphur. Very citrussy taste again, lemony; lipsmacking sour flavour. Again quite Cantillon-character, but it lacks a bit of depth, seemingly falling a bit dead. Sandcookies retronasal, before the citrussy acidity takes over the aftertaste. Farmyard, flowery touches and soldatenkoeken. Very refreshing, light, totally overattenuated, quite dry. A bit more ripening, a bit more applied blending, and this becomes a top-gueuze. Im sure it will, but I would diminish the amount of Cantillon lambic a bit, and use more oude lambik.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

Il est rare dassister à la naissance dune nouvelle gueuzerie, encore plus rare quand cette dernière est à côté de chez soi.
Cest donc heureux que jouvris cette bouteille.
La couleur est dorée laissant séchapper un tourbillon de bulles qui viennent percer la surface dun col blanc soyeux.
Au nez, je retrouve là toute la complexité dune gueuze artisanale, offrant ici un côté de moisi/renfermé avec une touche fruitée mais aussi une signature qui rappelle la Cantillon pour tout ceux qui en on déjà bu ou se sont déjà promenés à Cantillon.
En bouche, on retrouve ce palais de chêne donnant un fini boisé avec une certaine acidité allant vers différentes agrumes. Là aussi jidentifie encore Cantillon pour une bière qui donne un palais sec et laisse une effervescence qui vient chatouiller le palais.
Une très bonne gueuze, et qui demande à être revisitée dans le futur voire aussi à ouvrir une bouteille dans qcq années pour voir comment cette dernière aura évoluer.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
352,"2011-06-13",4.3,"375mL thanks to Travlr. The pour is a hazy, glowing light orange. A thick, dense, off-white head erupts with excellent retention for gueuze. Nose is obviously Cantillon house funk (part of this blend) with sharp grapefruit and lemon peel, peach fruit leather, sweet ruby red grapefruit fleshy pulp. Very fresh, tropical, awesome nose. Reminds me of Girardin and Cantillon blended. Taste is quenching grapefruit, fresh and pulpy grapefruit juice, bitter citrus. Very zippy and fresh with loads of tropical notes and peach. Really superb. Hilariously on target for a first batch. A new geuze blender with some mad talent.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Pretty cloudy light orange beer, practically no head. Aroma: lemons and lime, typical bretta nose, basement. MF: little carbon, medium body.

352,"2011-06-03",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2013 750 ml bottle opened at the US debut in Philadelphia at Monks Cafe - June 2011.
A: Hazy golden-wheat colored body.  Lively off-white head forms upon pouring.  Sticks around for a minute or two, leaving behind spotty lacing in the glass.
S: On the cleaner end of the gueuze spectrum.  A soft lemon citric aroma is central here.  My palate recognizes it as quintessential Girardin (which is one of the lambics blended into this).  Ever so slight mustyness.  
T: Like the nose, lemon-citrus dominates.  There is also a bit of sharper acidity which Id guess comes from the Cantillon lambic.  I found this to be decently complex.  Some constructive criticism would want a bit more earthiness.
M: Moderate effervescence.  Light to medium bodied.  Restrained sourness in the finish.  Acidity wasnt crazy.
O: I liked this.  Id put its flavor profile somewhere between Girardin and Cantillon, and while it could use more complexity, I think subsequent batches (or some age) will treat this well.  Hopefully it comes into the US market at a good price... cause Id gladly toss this into my normal line up with Cantillon, Drie Fonteinen, De Cam, and Girardin.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

352,"2011-05-28",3.3,"I had this beer at the opening day of this new geuze blender. It is great to see that geuze beer is getting increasingly popular, and new blender evolve. Beer pours a nice golden color with a fluffy head. Smell is moderately funk, with hay and some citrus. Taste is a bit sour with a bitter finish. I miss the taste layers in this one. Overall a nice try, but this beer lacks complexity. Cannot stand up to the world class blends of Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen yet, but maybe that is because this geuze is only a blend of two years. I will closely follow their new releases next year, when they will blend 3 years of lambic for the first time. Really hope that that will improve the complexity and quality.","Beersel, BELGIUM","fewa"
