1898,"2013-08-18",3.6,"Draft at Flying Saucer The bartender told me this was a Glold Medal beer at the recent competitions. The English Pale Ale pours a deep clear amber with creamy white head. The aroma was of pine resin and earthy. The taste was of resin and fresh citrus. This was an awesome beer that was a joy from beginning to end. The medium body ale had average to high carbonation. Homer recommended this ale. The finish was a winner with lingering bitterness and resin.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","Foxbush"
1898,"2013-08-10",3.5,"Good hoppy version of an EPA. Piney hop aroma at the start. Brown copper color with a nice white head. This was pretty fresh from the growler I picked up earlier in the day so it had a clean crisp palate. Average weight and carbonation. The hops addition took away some of the mellowness I find with most EPAs. Good balance with the hops and malts just not as traditional.","The Colony, Texas, USA","kevinator"

1898,"2013-07-24",3.0,"Carmely, toffee brown color. White, oily head. Smells like... cant smell much, maybe a little wood and metal, or maybe thats whats on my brain. The bite is strong and the flavor bitter toffee and caramel. Could have been a decent bitter except the abv is way to high to enjoy this in any sort of non-alcoholic way. At least its bitter. That bite is just a bit stiff. Complexity is what its got going for it.","austin, Texas, USA","kidmartinek"
