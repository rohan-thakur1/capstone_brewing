1166,"2017-05-30",4.8,"Tasted from can. Pours a murky orange with thick white head. Aroma is tropical fruits with some grapefruit. Extremely well balanced. Excellent tasting that goes down way too easy. Huge tropical fruit flavor with mango, papaya, pineapple and also some tangerine. Incredible imperial IPA.

1166,"2017-04-01",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 16, 2017 3/23/17 can. Pours murky light peach with a white head. Drinking this right after a fresh Tired Hands Grassman can. Nose is sweaty, musty with lots of Tree House fruits and a familiar house yeast. Soft raspberry / chocolate notes emerge. Mouth is really nice, lots of overripe fruits (peach, pear, mango) and a nice musty kick that I also got in Grassman. I suppose there are hops on the finish but they serve only to wash away the big fruit and yeast notes. Soft mouthfeel. Really good, as I expected. I usually like Tree House more than Tired Hands but IMO Grassman is a touch better than this.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
1166,"2017-03-31",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2017 Canned 03/23/17. Tropical Earthquake. Big thanks to the gf for picking this one up! Pours very hazy orange golden glow, like grapefruit juice. Aroma is insane. White peach, mango, grapefruit, tangerine, peach. Maybe a tiny bit dank as it warms. Reminds me of the first time I had haze. Perfect Aroma. Flavor is white peach, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit rind, some bitterness in the finish. Unreal.","New York, USA","SG111"

The nose shows a mix of mango, peaches, and light citric notes of grapefruit. 

The palate is highly carbonated and medium bodied. Flavors of juicy mango and peaches with a light citric edge of grapefruit. Grapefruit bitterness on the finish followed by a longer resurgence of grapefruit pith and zestiness. Refreshing and very fruit forward.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

1166,"2016-10-15",4.4,"Growler from the source. Cloudy opaque yellow/orange pour with a big white head. Big tropical fruit bouquet. The tropical fruits smash you in face right out of the gate then give way to bitter piney/resiny hop notes. Plenty of caramel malt backbeats to keep the balance in check. Peach and apricot undercurrents. Really good mouthfeel and body. This is delicious and dangerous at 8.6%....","Florida, USA","50belair"
1166,"2016-10-12",4.9,"Huge thank you to Mark for sharing this treat.

Hazy, juicy body with a half inch of head. The aroma is spectacular, offering a bouquet of tropical fruits and fresh hop. Cantaloupe, pineapple, orange, grapefruit. Sweetness perfectly melding with bitterness. Crushable. Amazing. I dont know how this beer can improve. In regards to IPAs, Tree House reigns supreme.","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"

1166,"2016-09-25",4.1,"Name is totally accurate. This pours a thick, orangey-peach color, with minimal head. Looks like a glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice. Aroma is full of tropical fruit notes--mango, peach, etc. Flavor is strongly citrus and tropical fruit. with some sweetness and just a touch of hop bite. Very nice beer.","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"
1166,"2016-09-23",4.9,"Another bucket list beer for me that Im happy to have shared at a tasting! Again, as with KJ, Im rating this higher than the regular Haze, but Id take the regular any day with this one near impossible to get and on the same level. Copying my notes from the regular with tiny tweaks as this was pretty much the same. Can. Pours a bright cloudy yellow orange with a sudsy white head. Aroma of citrus, pine, hop oils, pungent and dank. Flavor has juicy grapefruit and orange, peach, pine, light onion hints, pine notes, bitterness. Medium to full body, sticky and thicker texture, tiny notes of alcohol creeped in on the palate to finish. Very similar to the regular, but the aroma and flavor on this were more amped up and in your face. Probably a perfect 5 beer for me, but the alcohol on the end made me knock it down slightly, plus it was at a month old when we tried it. Would love a fresh batch to try within a week sometime, but Ill settle for this as it was still amazing!","Jamestown, New York, USA","bigda83"
1166,"2016-09-06",4.1,"Growler. Thanks, E&M! What a hell of a nice treat. Wish I had brought a couple more cool things to the tasting. Pours a murky bright orange with a dense and creamy whitish head. Big intense grapefruit and soft pineapple nose. Creamy medium body with soft carb, almost silky. Lightly toasted caramel under a big blast of grapefruit and pineapple on the mid palate. Hides the alcohol well. Long sweet finish.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

1166,"2016-08-04",3.5,"Can @ Monkish. As with Haze, a milky orange beer with white foam. This one isnt quite as enjoyable as regular Haze, in my opinion. Its a little more sweet and caramel forward and also has a more pronounced resinous and pithy bitterness. Still has some nice peach, grapefruit, orange, and dried pineapple hop character, though. Its fine enough, but not great.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

Can: The aroma consists of huge tropical fruits with some very mild citrus. It pours a a cloudy dull golden-orange with a small white head that fades to a minimal film outlined by a very thin ring. The flavor starts with moderate tropical fruits, pineapple, and mango. The finish has light-moderate grapefruit and a touch of lemon peel. Its light-medium bodied with mild carbonation and a soft mouthfeel.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
1166,"2016-06-15",4.7,"Hazy yellow-orange color, small off-white head. Potent aroma of sweet, ripe tropical fruits (melon, cantaloupe, pineapple, papaya, orange), and honey. Very good blend of bitter and sweet flavors. Delicate carb, body is almost light despite being a DIPA, and smooth. Finish is mild to moderate bitterness.","California, USA","Ataraxia"
1166,"2016-06-02",4.4,"16 oz can. The pour is a wonderful Tree House juicy orange chunky pour with a nice thick white head and a great lace that clings to the glass. The aroma is great. The juiciness and bright bitter hop really dominate this. Its not as profound as other Tree House specials. Its great still. Juicy and bright and lightly bitter. The flavor is excellent. Its bright and juicy with a lovely bitterness. The hop just takes over the first bit and then the juice controls the back end. The mouth feel is excellent. Thick and juicy with a light carbonation and a nice crispness on the finish. This is a damn good beer! Thank god for Tree House.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
1166,"2016-05-12",4.1,"Fresh growler at a bottle share. This has all of the ""Tree House style"" -- the silky-sweetness of the base beer, the juicy aroma hops, and the low bitterness -- but seriously amplified. I thought I was eating overly ripe fruit and getting diabetes (in a good way). Seriously intense, but also a seriously good drink.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
1166,"2016-04-21",5.0,"Another fantastic beer from tree house, cant compete with green perhaps, but Absolutely great. Pineapple aroma, then grapefruit, some mango, a lot of tropical Juice, then Lemon. Hazy golden, orange, with white head. A lot of pineapple on the first, mango, stright after the malt background arrives a grapefruite backbone, some lemony, zest bitterness, a lot of citrus presence, some citrus sourness. Very complex and brilliant beer. Sticky on the palate, you cant taste the abv. Medium body ed, creamy mouthfeel.","ITALY","Fashawn"
1166,"2016-03-15",4.3,"growler thanks to Kyle, you are hitting the upper limit of the alcohol for IPAs, moderate sweetness and might bitterness is still behind the hop flavor. Yhank you treehouse for knowing how to make a DIPA. Maybe 3 other breweries can.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
1166,"2016-03-11",4.0,"Canned 2/18/16, drunk 3/10/16, thanks to Blisscent.A huge wallop of grapefruit and pineapple hits the nose upon cracking the can. Pours a very hazy, deep golden-bronze color with a medium-sized white head that shows moderate to moderately-strong retention.Big pineapple and orange rind in the nose slowly allow lighter mango and meyer lemon notes to unfold. Almost doughy maltiness in the background shows plenty of bread and light honey. Limes and grapefruits linger on the end, with no alcohol or flaw.Lightly earthy, with a strong spiciness not found in the nose, perhaps the bitterness kicking in. Its definitely more bitter than your average juice bomb, though this is not really a juice bomb, being much more given to dry pineapple and strong citrus character. Dry, but with the always wonderful carbonation/texture of Tree House. With warming/breathing, it lightens up somewhat and the bitterness gets soaked up by more malt being perceived. Lightly dank, earthy flavors abound but the signature grapefruit and pineapple still remain. Alcohol is well-concealed, though it has a bit of a drying effect on the beer and does contribute some light sharpness. Pretty much exactly Trilliums double dry hopped Summer Street, which is a well-made beer, as well, though very challenging for me to drink. I much prefer the non-bitter juice bombs.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1166,"2016-03-03",4.2,"Poured from can into a tulip: Compared heads up to regular Haze. It took me 10 sips of each to be able to tell the difference. There is slightly more pineapple flavor in Very Hazy once it warms up, thats it, not worth the effort to obtain it much like Very Green. Like Haze, its still an awesome beer. Pours hazy golden with a one finger head. Pineapple / tropical explosion in the nose, taste is more of the same with very little booze considering the ABV and no bitterness at all. Its like drinking juice.","Willington, Connecticut, USA","bellco33"
1166,"2016-02-25",4.1,"Growler. Pours a hazy orange with mediun frothy white head that lasts. The aroma is strong pine, dank, tropical fruit. Medium mouth, pineapple, mango, dank, juicy, light bitterness, very nice.","Houston, Texas, USA","djd07"
1166,"2016-02-22",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2016 Beer consumed side by side with haze. Barely discernable difference and really not worth any additional effort or price over haze. That being said its still great. Hazy peach color with white lasting head. Aroma is grapefruit, papaya, light onion, pear, and soft bready malts. Taste is mild booze and some sweetness. Overall great as usual.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"
