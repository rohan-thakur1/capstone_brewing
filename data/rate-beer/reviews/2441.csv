2441,"2016-05-02",3.8,"Bottle... Pours clear and yellow with no head and nearly no legs. The aroma is a perfect blend of fresh Red Delicious, Macintosh and lightly pungent apples that have been cut in halves and laid out on someones back porch for 12 hours on a hot August day. Full-bodied with a thick, velvety mouthfeel and minimal carbonation. The flavor is quite tart, to the point that the acidity becomes a bit overbearing. Still luxurious and highly enjoyable nonetheless. Bottle courtesy of darkguardian!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

2441,"2016-02-20",4.0,"Sample at the tasting room. Clear gold pour. Aroma is rich, nice candied apple, caramel, vanilla, light volatile alcohol, definitely pick up a touch of spirit in the nose. Taste is sweet, very light acidity, nice mellow vanilla oak flavor, mild distilled alcohol warmth, I like how well it goes together without the alcohol overpowering the (excellent!) base cider. Palate is full bodied with a somewhat drier feeling finish than the regular heirloom, I feel the spirit contributes to this a lot. Tasty.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

2441,"2015-12-28",3.8,"375 mL bottle. Clear golden body. Smells of sharply acidic apples. Taste is immensely tart up front. Really intense. Sweetness takes over in the back end, which it really needs. I appreciate the tartness up front, but its really intense and definitely needs the sweetness the cut it down a bit.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

>>> A unique and enjoyable brandy barrel-aged ice cider that turned out to be a bit boozy but is still well balanced by a sharp acidity and interesting oak and barrels features.

-  Bright golden with orangey tints leaving nice sticky legs on the glass. 
-  Overripe apples combine with caramel, brandy, oak and wood spiciness for a complex flavor profile. 
-  Despite an average ABV for an ice cider, this one is a bit boozy because of the brandy barrel-aging. Not to the point of being harsh though and I think the brandy barrel features still brought more positive than negative aspects to this ice cider. 
-  Acidity is sharp and that was needed to bring some balance to an ice cider where the alcohol (and to a lesser extent the sweetness) are more present than in your usual ice cider. 
-  Body is full. Mouthfeel is liquorous and a bit oily. Warming and a tiny bit hot finish. Mouth coating sweetness is cut by a sharp acidity nicely. 
-  Its far from the level of their Northern Spy in terms of the uniqueness character brought by the barrels to the Ice Cider, but its still a pretty fun, tasty and unique experience.
