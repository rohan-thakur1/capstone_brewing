It poured out of a wooden cask via gravity feed into 0.2l tall straight sided glass with crystal clear gold body and tall white head with spotty clingy lacing. The modest aroma is soft, inviting and delivering crisp fresh spicy hops, a bit of earthy hops and faint grainy malts in the background. The taste unloads first a pleasing fresh spicy hoppiness. It then quickly picks up smooth and nourishing fresh grainy malts and then some floral hops in a supporting role. It remains crisp and fresh into the finish. This is scratching me right where I itch. It leaves a pleasing spicy hoppiness and a fading grainy maltiness deep into the after taste.

213,"2011-07-10",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2011 My Bottom Line :  
Cushiony pils malts develop honeyed angles to envelop this masterful Kölschs herbal hops, as minute banana esters add depth to an already evocative quaff. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A healthy head of foam laces endlessly atop the clear golden. 
-The fluffy natural carbonation and lean residual sugars make for great drinkability. A veritable pillow of a mouthfeel.
-The herbal hop finish is levelled with the rest of the brews moderate intensity. 
-Malts also offer cracker-like flavors.
-This one looked and felt like it was more loosely filtered than other Kölsches in town. In any case, the yeast seemed to play a bigger role in the aroma and flavor profile.

Great Kölsch. Very well-balanced and elegant. Some hops in the finish. Crisp and pleasant brew.","Copenhagen K, DENMARK","Mads Langtved"
213,"2006-02-11",2.9,"A hazy orange beer with a small lazing white head. The aroma is sweet with notes of caramel and malt. The flavor is sweet and very crisp with notes of caramel and malt, leading to a dry bitter end. A very refreshing Kölsch.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
213,"2005-11-22",4.3,"A bit different from the typical Kölsch: maltier, hoppier, less dry. Color 9 EBC, bitterness about 30. The tastiest of all Kölsches; the least typical. Good food at the brewery and their Altstadt tap as well.","New York, USA","lovibond"
213,"2005-10-31",3.5,"Draught at Die Hausbruaerie Paffgen, Koln, 20cl x many, Filtered. What to rate really, yes this is the best Kolsch I tasted throughout an extended weekend in Cologne and yes it  was spritzy, pale, light, particularly bitter but with fruity top notes and dry, but this is not what Kolsch is about really. The experience of Paffgen is the beer hall, the noise, the buzz and this has everything you need. Constantly topped up fresh beer with just enough alcohol to keep hings relaxed. Great beer in a great place, good enough for me.","Banbury, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","imdownthepub"
213,"2005-09-21",4.0,"Rating #2500 and last beer of GBBF 2005! Grainy cereal malt in the clean fresh, lightly fruity aroma.  Clear golden body is topped by a creamy, off-white, fine bubbled head that lasts and laces.  Grainy cereal malts with some fruitiness and herbal, grassy, lightly spicy hop flavour.  Light refreshing body with lively, prickly effervescence.  On tap at GBBF 2005.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
213,"2005-04-17",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 8, 2012 Served right from the wooden cask in the brewery tap: Pale golden colour; clear; thin foamy white head; slight fruity and hoppy nose; light bodied, but robust and not watery at all; the slight initial maltyness ends in a long lasting hoppy finish. Tends a bit towards the Pils-style; not so fruity as it could be expected from a top-fermented brew.
Note: This excellent Koelsch is only available at three places in Cologne: Brewery Tap, Max Stark and Päffgen (Salzgasse); the nostalgic Lommerzheim closed in 2004 ! Lommerzheim opened again in 2008, a great place to sample this great Kølsch","Bochum, Porúří, GERMANY","pivnizub"

213,"2005-03-15",4.6,"My favorite domestic Kölsch because of its hoppy style. Lightly malted, crispy and wholehearted (as a Kölsch can be).  It is normally only available in wooden casks in a few pubs in Cologne (Hausbrauerei Päffgen, Brauhaus Salzgasse, Lommerzheim and Max Stark), but at Max Stark I have seen swing top bottles of Päffgen Kölsch a few weeks ago.","Ottobrunn, GERMANY","MoritzF"

213,"2004-12-14",3.6,"draught   Golden, totally clear; creamy yellowish super-dense head leaving good lace. Freshly ground greenmalt, bit of grassy to hay-ish nose. Sweet excellent pale malts, finish is clear-hoppy. Sweetness restrained by the perfect quality hops, giving low, but affirmative bitterness. Light bodied but nowhere empty, certain slickness. My brewing companion tells me this is the hardest style to brew. Im not surprised. Here, they do it to perfection.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
213,"2004-12-06",3.5,"From a wooden barrel at the brewery tap in Köln, and also at the excellent Lommerzheim. Gold, good lasting white head and gentle natural condition. Subdued maltiness in the nose, Sweet malt initially in the mouth with a developing fruity berry note and some tinny hoppiness. Smooth, hop bitter finish with some gentle malt.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
213,"2004-08-24",3.9,"This was one of the best I tried in Koln a few years ago, a cut above Fruh in quality.  Despite a good wheaty tang, and a refreshingly balanced hop character, what really shines in the subtle yeasty/ale character missing in some of the larger brewpubs offerings.   It was a rainy and cold day when I visited and had a lovely bowl of cream of white asparagus soup to take the chill off.  The pub location closest to the Dom seemed a little standoffish of outsiders, but was cosy and had the feel of a real local place.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","Northernbrewer"
213,"2004-07-07",2.9,"Light fruity hops, with good wheaty notes, some malts. Light vinegar. Dark golden clear with thin white lacing head. Watery with medium carbonation. Starts with light acidity, wheat, and malt. Finish is more acidic, with dull bitterness. Finish is light bitter. After has light bitter, dry astringency. Think lines were fouled.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"
