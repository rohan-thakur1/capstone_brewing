670,"2017-03-28",4.0,"Bottle... This beer rocks! Clear dark-copper pour with no head. The luxuriant aroma features caramel, toasted nuts, port, dustiness and a small splash of bourbon. Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and jazzy. The flavor is moderately sweet and lightly vinous - singed caramel and a splash of port with a boozy, bourbony, discreetly bitter finish. This world-class bottle of beer was generously shared by biggsbowler!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

670,"2016-06-27",4.5,"Taps coffee brown with a thin but serviceable buff head. Aroma offers a bold chord of roasted malt, vanilla, bourbon-infused oak, toffee and quality coffee notes. Will make any stoutie go totally Pavlov! Flavor delivers bourbon, woody, vanilla, roast malt and toffee tones. Mouthfeel features firm body and lively fizz. Get a cup of the Creature from this Black Lagoon.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
670,"2016-06-16",3.4,"Bottle @ The Greenwald Residence. Thanks, Jake. Murky brown color with no foam. Big time bourbon and vanilla on the nose. A good bit of caramel, some toffee, and dark fruit. Maybe a little bit of wood spice and tannins on the finish. Theres a definite boozy heat to it. Decent amount of milk chocolate as well. A little intense, but its okay.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
670,"2016-03-07",3.8,"650 mL bottle. Deep amber body. Smell has lots of bourbon. Strong oak. Caramel and butterscotch. Taste has butterscotch, dark fruits, oak, booze. Bitter roasted malts and some chocolate. Bourbony finish. Heavy and sweet, but almost worth the sugar and alcohol.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
670,"2016-03-07",4.0,"Bottle generously shared by Randall. Brown pour with no real head. Sweet caramel aromas. Interesting with loads of caramel, butterscotch, oak, and bourbon notes. It doesnt have that wacky cola flavor I find so off putting. God body and mouthfeel.","Florida, USA","50belair"
670,"2016-02-15",4.5,"Bomber - Best new beer I have had in a long time. It helps that I love the style but this BAWH is rivaled by only one or two others. Complex flavors of wood, smoke, bourbon, cola, sweet malts, and maybe even a hint of peat and vanilla. Thick on the palate. So glad I was able to pick up a few extra bombers. Well done.","California, USA","48FanInCali"

Id be lying if I said I came to the North Park Rip Current tasting room for any other reason than this beer. Yeah, really wanted to review In the Curl (I demoted it), but this was why I made Friday afternoon my day. This was so important that I even dropped my 8-oz. minimum (sometimes drop to six ounces anyway) for reviewing a beer. High expectations for this one would be the understatement of the new year for me. 

Poured a mahogany color with one finger of khaki, white head when I got it. Minimal lacing on the sides of the glass. Minimal retention. (Sight - 3.75)

Smelled plum, dark raspberry, bourbon barrel, fairly boozy, scotch, butterscotch, roasted caramel and toffee. (Smell - 4.25)

First thought on the taste was wow. Thinking The Bruery. Boozy, but not overwhelming. Bourbon, bourbon barrel, dark fruits - plums, raspberries and cherries - toffee, caramel, scotch and butterscotch. (Taste - 4.75)

Medium-to-full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, warming finish. (Feel - 5.00)

This was just an awesome bourbon barrel-aged beer. In heaven. Kind of literally (queue Warrants Heaven.) (Overall - 4.75)

670,"2015-12-27",4.4,"Pours reddish copper with a one finger tan head with nice lacing. Aroma is of dark fruits, bourbon, wood, sweet malts, butterscotch, vanilla, toffee, caramel, and just a little booze. Taste is about the same as the aroma. Has a medium-full body with a creamy, slightly oily mouthfeel and a mostly sweet, semi warming, long finish. Overall, a very tasty and complex beer that incrediblely hides its extreme abv very well.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","skmikeg"
