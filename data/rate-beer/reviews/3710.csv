Not bad, for the style. The whiskey barrel ageing adds some pleasant note to a style that I usually find to be fairly boring. (13/20)

Arômes de pain grillé et de sucre dorge, avec de la réglisse rouge, et petits fruits rouges (cerise, fraise). Davantage en arrière-plan, on note des effluves boisés et de vanille, avec un certain houblon herbacé et végétal (branchage, feuillage). Enfin, on peut déceler par moment des odeurs de caramel, de noisette, de grain rôti, de poivre et dalcool. Nez bien intéressant, belle complexité, bonne intensité. En bouche, pétillement plutôt faible sur la langue, mais onctuosité bien élevée au palais, cest rond, moelleux, soyeux et velouté. Au goût, entrée maltée de pain grillé et sucre dorge, avec une bonne dose de réglisse rouge et de fruits rouges, et quelques notes de caramel, de noisette, et même de chocolat brun par moment. Une bonne saveur boisée accompagne ce malt avant de dominer une finale au cours de laquelle se pointe également un léger goût alcoolisé (whiskey?) ainsi quun bon sucre résiduel. Bière principalement sucrée, amertume légère en fin de bouche, houblon très peu goûteux et probablement principalement végétal (branchage). Par moment, il me semble déceler de subtiles saveurs de fumée, de tourbe et de vanille, provenant vraisemblablement du vieillissement partiel en fût de whiskey. Bière particulièrement sucrée, mais personnellement jaime beaucoup ça, excellente intégration des différentes saveurs entre elles, complexité très élevée et bonne intensité.

Enfin, rien dans les arômes qui annonce une révolution de ce style insignifiant.  Quelques gorgées plus loin, des malts grillés et des malts grillés avec des malts grillés et une légère astringence boisée et poivrée.  La présence de ce fantôme apporte-t-elle une réelle profondeur?  Je ne pense pas et, à bien y réfléchir, je souhaite afficher mon indifférence face à cette proposition plutôt insipide.  En bouche, une sensation ordinaire.  Le corps de Patrick est plutôt mince.  Son pétillement est efficace et sa texture presque huileuse.  Sa finale apporte certainement une impression boisée qui relève davantage dune eau-de-vie brune bon marché que dune liqueur maltée de grande qualité.  En conclusion, je me permets de croire que cette bière nest pas catastrophique.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
3710,"2013-03-17",3.3,"600 mL bottle. Pours a red copper with a soapy beige head. Aromas of malt, caramel, oak and estery hop.  Medium bodied with high carbonation. Malt forward and rich.","Mississauga, Ontario, CANADA","shaynsawchuk"
3710,"2013-03-17",3.7,"600 mL bottle.  Copper in colour with a small off-white head.  The whiskey barrel adds a nice subtle touch at the end of the flavour, that really makes this beer stand out.  Very clean.  Nice body for the style.  One of the strongest offerings from Beaus thus far, and one of the best Irish Reds Ive ever tried.","Cavan Monaghan, Ontario, CANADA","TheJester"
3710,"2013-03-15",3.7,"Bottle 1799 from 2012 release.  Thanks to Jay for the bottle.  This was not planned to be aged a year, we just did not meet up for over a year!  A lovely house warming present.  Also nice to have a couple of days before St Patricks Day and after a month without beer.  And my son Patrick just turned 2 as well.  And this is rating #2800!  Ok, with all of that out of the way here goes.  Red tinted orange/brown, very little head - what is there looks creamy.  Aroma is nice - sweet vanilla, wood, and some fruit as well.  Taste - pretty interesting.  Light fruity hops present, quite light bodied with a nice carbonated mouthfeel - was expecting thick, but this is quite drinkable right off the bat.  Sweetness of vanilla comes in in the second half.  Some alcohol present at the end of the sweet linger, but not really there - which is impressive as it could overwhelm on this body.  Nice toasty malt taste overall with just a hint of whiskey as well.  Innis and Gunn could learn a thing or two from these folks on how to balance a barrel with a lighter bodied beer.  I quite enjoyed it.  Looking forward to comparing it to this years bottle as well, which my buddy Colin picked up for me (thanks!).  Nice job Beaus and a good choice for rating 2800 - I slowly lurch towards 3000 - should be there by 2015 :) .","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
3710,"2013-03-09",3.2,"Thanks for bringing an older Wild Oats Series back. Pours a clean dark amber colour with lots of active, tiny bubble, carbonation. Warm frothy cap goes down slowly with minimal lacing. Aromas are a mix of hop and malts with notes of spices. The same can be found in the taste, with the malt winning the war in the finish, and lingering a bit longer than the spicy hop. Not seeing any sing of the ""aged in oak"". Not one of my favorite styles anyways. Still, well-brewed overall.","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"
3710,"2013-03-07",3.1,"Bottle - pours a hazed reddish-amber with a 1 finger white cap. Aroma is caramely with some toastiness.

Well enough made but too sweet for my tastes.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"
3710,"2013-03-02",3.2,"Clear amber coloured pour with a thick white head. The nose is lightly sweet with a touch of vanilla and some toasted barley. That odd sort of slick sweetness that I find typifies Irish ales (and is why I generally dont like them). A little bit of light fruitiness and a touch of black pepper. A touch of sweet estery character (green apple and some berry). There is a little bit of nuttiness as well. It doesnt quite come together for me","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
3710,"2013-03-02",3.0,"600ml bottle from the lcbo. more beaus trickery, very poor example of an irish ale. no rich maltiness, very bland in both aroma and flavour. no sign of the 1/8th barrel aging. deep orange, not even red. pretty much just all around lies. oh and $8 for the bottle. why did i buy this? the beer itself doesnt taste bad and really doesnt have any brewing flaws, its just not to style and the description on the bottle doesnt match the beer inside it. overall this is a bland 6.7% english strong, drinkable for the weight but dissapointing overall.","Cambridge, Ontario, CANADA","barncatmatt"
3710,"2013-03-01",3.4,"On tap at the Cloak and Dagger in Toronto, served in a tulip. Pours clear reddish amber with a moderate beige head that remains and leaves a small amount of lace. On the nose, there are notes of caramel, brown sugar, grass and flowers. The flavour is moderately sweet with caramel, honey, flowers and a touch of hops. The finish is moderate in length and lightly hoppy. On the palate, it is light-medium in body with a smooth, creamy texture. Overall, a decent red ale with a nice hoppy note. 2013-03-01","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"
3710,"2013-03-01",3.4,"Bottle from the LCBO, this beer pours a deep rich ruby red with a fantastic huge puffy head that lasts. The aroma is of smoked wood, vanilla, roasted malts, arrow root cookie, cereal, and some toffee. My initial reaction was that this beer is very creamy. After drinking more of it, the creaminess gave way to a slick oily texture in the mouth. 

Tasting notes include sweet rich malts, coffee, banana, and alcohol. This beer is  very mildly hopped, and leaves a lingering black liquorice taste in the mouth. The beer is a little thin in the palate, almost one dimensional. However, overall it is quite enjoyable.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","Canmoore"

Cloudy red/brown/amber with moderate creamy head. Big malt in the aroma. Taste is kind of like a slightly weaker Scotch Ale, touch of mild earthy bitterness on the finish after a caramel malt. Hints of the wood and alcohol. Body is creamy. Overall, I rather enjoyed this one. Taste and body were nice and full.","Saint John, New Brunswick, CANADA","HeistAlmighty"

3710,"2012-06-23",4.0,"Ruby red bordering on brown, small beige head. Big bready, doughy sweet chewy malts. This is bordering doppelbock territory. As soon as the big malts die down, there is a nice shot of roasted nuts, and some herbal woodiness. Body is a little thick, and the carb is a tad low, but im not surprised. The finish is nutty, roasty, and sweet. Its all wrapped in a sweet woody, malty blanket, quite nice!","Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, CANADA","robinvboyer"
