486,"2017-04-30",3.8,"Une bière noire, avec une fine ligne de mousse, ainsi quune petite effervescence. Au nez, le café est bien présent, un peu comme avec la péché classique, avec un certain arôme de chocolat qui sajoute au goût.

Le café est présent, avec le gout de grain frais qui apporte de la profondeur à cette amertume, de même quun peu de chocolat en finale.

486,"2017-04-17",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Roasty coffee beans are perfectly integrated in this cushy Stout, giving off tiramisu impressions and just enough bitterness to balance out the few sugars.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the blackened brown.
-This one feels drier than Péché Mortel, and as such is more drinkable.
-This must be excellent on nitrogen.
-Dark malts and the coffee treatment are harmonious, to say the least.

Bref : Bien quelle nait rien dextravagant, cette bière est une belle réussite sans faux-pas. On a des éléments de la signature de la Péché Mortel bien présents : le café, lamertume, la sécheresse, laspect crémeux. Par contre, rien de surprenant à constater que le malt présente moins de profondeur et que le corps est aminci.

Of course there are exceptions, but when you go from 9.5% down to 6%, youve got my attention.Dark mahogany-to-ebony body shows moderate clarity and is topped by a tan head that shows moderate retention.Light coffee, tons of vanilla, soft, earthy, lightly bitter roast and big chocolate flavors all signify the base beers charm, but theres no punch on the end whatsoever. It just tapers off in to dry chocolate, light raisin-vanilla and bready malts.But for the less syrupy/rich flavor and thicker texture, its hard to tell the two apart. This does a wonderful job of taking out the intense bitterness, chocolate-vanilla richness and light alcohol overtones while still preserving a very flavorful coffee stout.

Or je lève mon chapeau aux brasseurs qui savent nous surprendre et nous faire redécouvrir cette bière que nous croyons connaître par coeur! La Péché Véniel est légère et coiffée dune mousse crémeuse des plus alléchantes! Un stout quon déguste dabord avec les yeux. En bouche, la bière manque un peu de rondeur, mais bon ça reste un stout et tout le défi est là : ne pas sattendre à une Péché Mortel. En ce sens, rien de négatif, cest en fait une belle surprise. Lalcool est parfaitement camouflé par les riches arômes de grains de café rôtis qui volent la vedette. La finale est longue, légère et désaltérante. Parfaite à lapéro! Merci DDC pour cet autre magnifique produit!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

486,"2015-03-15",3.8,"Drank on tap (14 oz) at the Montreal brewpub on March 15, 2015. Black, big head (nitro). Sweet coffee aroma, light sour red fruit notes. It taste like Péché Mortel, but without the strong alcohol notes, light coffee bitterness. Its Péché Mortel Light!","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","Quevillon"
486,"2015-03-09",4.1,"En fût à LAutre Oeil (Gatineau, QC). Robe noire, opaque et sans effervescence. Col crémeux beige et dûrable. Arôme malté/houblonné bien équilibré. On décèle des nuances de café, de cacao et de bois. Son goût parfaitement équilibré est caractérisé par une texture douce et des notes de café torréfié, de bois et de sucre brun. Belle finale amère/grillée. Fantastique!","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
486,"2015-03-07",3.6,"Spuytin Duyvil, Brooklyn tap: Pours black with a beige head. Aroma is coffee and tons of it, chocolate, but really moatly coffee. Taste is a whole lot of coffee... Coffee grounds mostly... Some chocolate tinge in there for sure. Pretty light bodied it seems. Pretty heavy aftertaste. Good.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
486,"2015-03-05",3.7,"Exceptional as expected. Clean, light, sweet. Seems thin. Creamy berries with earth , ash , and coffee. I want to say more but I got three more versions to go through.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","Cirrhosis"
486,"2015-03-04",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 29, 2016 2015 version : On tap at Le Cactus (Péché Day 2015). Pitch black with a small bubbly beige head and little lacing. Aroma is of strong coffee presence along herbal notes, light caramel and hints of chocolate. Taste is of strong coffee, light caramel presence, herbal presence, light chocolate and light to moderate coffee bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the amount of coffee theres in there. Lingering coffee finish. It feels like theres a much coffee as in the regular version, but the lack of body makes it much more difficult for the beer to handle it. Lack of balance. Decent stout. 7-3-7-3-14 = 3.4

2016 version : On tap at Griendel (Péché Day 2016). Black with a creamy beige head, good retention, leaving some lacing. Much more balanced than last year version. Theres nice notes of vanilla alongside coffee presence - which is toned down and more in line with the body / abv of the beer this year - roasted malts and caramel. Palate is nearly a perfect 5 this year as its super smooth all along. Silky. This years version is mightily drinkable for a stout while still super flavorful. Very good. 8-4-8-4-16 = 4.0","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

486,"2015-03-01",3.8,"Pitch black. Very minimal head. Has an intense cream coffee aroma with walnut, chestnut and vanilla. Just so much coffee taste. Intense roasted taste very smooth. Loads of bakers chocolate. Almost no sweetness at all. More like a porter than stout","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

Aroma is chocolate and roasted grains with some coffee notes. Taste is a chocolate malty sweetness with a roasted grain and coffee bitterness. Medium bodied with modest carbonation.

486,"2015-03-01",3.8,"Dans un verre de 8 onces sur la rue Laurier. Belle tête dense et crémeuse. Corps noir comme il se doit. Au nez, leffet du café mélangé avec des notes plus douces de caramel est tout simplement appétissant. Jaime la justesse du produit. La première gorgée et les suivantes révèlent beaucoup de café mais aussi une petite acidité qui tente de machaler. Heureusement, des notes sucrées arrivent à me les faire bien oublier. En bouche, cest un peu mince mais très réussi. Japprécie ce conditionnement qui rend le liquide bien crémeux. En finale, ça dégage une belle amertume qui rend lappareil bien digeste et, par surcroît, facile à boire.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
