3671,"2017-02-10",3.4,"375 ml bottle. The beer is a nice deep mahogany color. Maybe a bit cloudy but hard to tell. Small beige-ish head, a bit fizzy. Tons of sherry barrel flavor. It pretty much overwhelms the other flavors. Big vinous notes with a good deal of spice. Lots of oak. Some caramel, molasses. It seems like theres a nice toasty malt base but its a bit hard to find underneath the sherry barrel. Fairly sweet but that spicy, oaky, grapey action is the main star in the taste, as well. Its hard to stay entirely away from harsher territory with all of that barrel, but its mostly managed here. Pretty smooth, at least relatively to the flavor. Oak bitterness in the finish. Medium body.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
