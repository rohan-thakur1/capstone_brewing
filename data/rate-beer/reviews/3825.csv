3825,"2015-07-13",3.5,"Bottle (Nov 2014 bottling).
Head is initially very small, frothy, white, fully diminishing.
Body is medium yellow.
Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), lightly yeasty (cobwebs, barnyard), with notes of sour apple, oak, lemon juice, band-aid.
Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.
Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic.
Kind of a generic wild/sour ale, but either way its a fun, clean, nicely made brewski.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3825,"2015-07-13",3.5,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2015 500ml bottle November 2014 batch, semi-blind rating. Hazy gold with a short and fine-bubbled white head. First impression of the aroma is bacteria / wild yeast blend (brett / must / cobwebs), hops as lemons, apricots, malt as hay and faint toast, with a strange note of cucumber. Medium bodied, lightly sweet, tart and acidic and sour with citric lemon juice. Fluffy carbonation gives way to sharp acids and faint oak and bitter green apples. Begins to smell like lemon or orange bitters in the way of a cocktail, I would believe they put lemon oil or zest in this since it seems to emerge with warmth, but theres also maybe some alcohol giving it a rye whiskey resemblance. Dried pineapple pieces, maybe some coconut shaving impression I get from the oak, which is nicely minimal. All around solid wild yeast Belgian-ish beer, and blind I would peg this for a Sour/Wild rather than Saison.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

3825,"2015-04-28",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 10, 2015 Pour is transparent golden amber with a medium amount of tight white head and some retention. Nose is super bright, tons of tangerine, lightly tart, soft peppery saison yeast, and light oakiness. Flavor is also extremely bright, not quite as deep or integrated as the nose. The fruity tangerines are the most dominant flavor, light oakiness, still some saison yeast, gently tart finish. Everything isnt quite as pulled together as the nose but the elements are still there. Body is light, a touch syrupy, soft carb, dry finish.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","cpetrone84"

3825,"2015-03-04",4.0,"500 ml. bottle from PhillyCraft. Thanks Vin! It pours a hazy orange/gold color with a decent off white head. Lots of streaming bubbles. The aroma is very nice with tangerine citrus, lemony citric tartness, subtle oak, funk and light shortbread cookie sweetness. The flavor is very fruity with more citrus tangerine, lemon along with peach, pluot, pomelo and hints of grape. Nice mild brett phenolics in the finish along with more citrus sour. The body is rather big for a beer like this, with more very light shortbread cookie like malts. The oak is tasted along with more fruity sweet/tart in the finish. No acetic acid or any other major off flavors. I really liked this one. A bit thicker bodied than other sour Saisons, but the flavors were spot on.

Incredibly oaky nose dominated by vanilla and wood chips, lightly pungent skunky hops, bits of hay and cracker. Very harmonious, balanced, and nuanced in the same way as Dochter Seizoen. Flavor disappointing by comparison. First 1/3 of bottle very citric, thin lemon juice, faint brett and eggshell mid that grows as you go deeper into the bottle. Reminiscent of a dry riesling and HF Serrasin but even less sweet. Filmy on the tongue, too slick in the lightly bitter, grassy finish. No dregs in the end, oily, most astringent brett moments but also dustiest/rounded flavor and brightest carbonation, prickly whereas first 2/3 of bottle was slick. No diacetyl issues, no butter hints at all despite huge oak and vanilla presence. Another winner from PAs best saison brewery.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"
