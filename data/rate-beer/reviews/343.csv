There is a great citrusy acidity to it and the signature Cantillon funk. I like the sweetness of the cognac barrel throughout. The light grape must is nice as well. The flavor is nice and acidic. There is a great sourness and a light funk. The cognac and grape just go so well together. Its balanced, tart, crisp, and fantastic.

Slightly hazy yellow. No head. Not completely lifeless, but not a lot going on.

Fruity sweet aroma. Some oak and lactic lemony acids. Wheat and some grassiness.

Taste is sour, but the oaky vanilla flavor moderates it. Very oaky, really. Some fruitiness I cant put my finger on. I guess thats the cognac barrel, but Im no expert on cognac. Grainy in the finish.

Lucky enough to score a bottle of this last year on a trip to Brussels, I have been eagerly waiting for a chance to open it ever since. Rating number 3,000 seemed as good a reason as any so while the palates were still fresh I shared one at a recent tasting. In hindsight I do wish that I could have split it with more folks who helped me reach the milestone because this world class release sets the bar high even for Cantillon. Hopefully folks like b3shine, ContemplateBeer, tastybeer, hezron, malachi, 1FastSti, Ughsmash, miketd, leaparsons, chriso, Travlr, and all those other people I have shared beers with over the years get a shot at this if theyve not already stored a case in the cellar.

Aroma / Appearance - A golden flat base lacks much, if any, carbonation. Typical of an old lambic it pours with no head. Cognac and lemons grace the air with a smooth vinegary finish that is not nearly as intense as originally expected.

Flavor / Palate - Cognac and lemons provide all the depth this gem requires. The light smooth mouthfeel finishes with a tart kick. A long lasting finish reminds one of a great bottle of vintage cognac pulled from a dusty cellar. I wish I had another bottle to share with people down the road because this is an experience that everyone should get at least once during their rating careers.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

343,"2014-07-12",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2014 One of the uncompromising and creative Cantillon lambics, matured on cognac barrels for 2 years and named after the brewerys geographic coordinates. Yellow-white, creamy, thinnish but very stable head, like the classic Cantillon Gueuze, colour also identical to the Gueuze (old gold with the typical champenoise sparkling); aroma breathes Cantillon in all respects, with its characteristic impressions of wet hay, lemon juice, rancid butter, dry sherry and sour, unripe berries, but in comparison with the standard Gueuze less citric acid and more woody, more mature as it were, with a very subtle, but still recognisable cognac flavour; this is reflected in the taste, which attacks less agressively than the Gueuze (as in: less citric acid), softer, more rounded maltiness, green apple and grapefruit, sharply tingling carbonasition as in any good geuze, aftertaste woody and dry, although seemingly less bitter than the Gueuze, with again that subtle, almost vague hint of cognac. An interesting experiment and a subtle variation on the geuze theme - and considering the limitations of the genre in terms of production, any authentic and uncompromised variation in geuze is welcome to me.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

The taste, again, was more just a slightly funky beer with some fruity qualities, which are nice. My only knock on this beer is that it just wasnt sour enough.

UPDATE: I tried it again at Cantillon on April 18th 2014. We decanted it for 1 hour in a jar before drinking it and it makes all the difference. Wow! Now we can feel the cognac in this one, in both the nose and the aroma. Way more complex this way and you even get a little more warming presence in the mouthfeel.

Hazy yellow color, some subtle lacing and some subtle half inch head. Thicker ABV legs with this though. 
Nose is apple, pear, citrus, and after a bit oak and cognac. More muddled and heavy than the lower ABV Cantillon offerings. 
Taste is a lot of oak, cognac, wine, apple, pear and citrus. More like a wooded fume blanc with the amount of oak and fruit. Very vinous character. 
Feel is much more about the barrel. Oaked fruit, slightly heavy and a lot less carbonation than others. Nice but possible too heavy and not as lifted. Fun to try but was a bit meh about it","AUSTRALIA","fletchfighters"

S: Lemony with a sweet cognac backing. Oak with a slight sourness to it. A little acetone as well. Slightly acidic as well.

A lightly carbonated that caresses the palate at the same time as the cognac flavors remain in the finish indefinitely.

I have also tasted the ""regular"" 50N4E which is also a fantastic beer but it has a prickly taste that I do not agree with, this is probably the cognac. still a great beer though! but it feels young, too young for its own good. (havent had the 2007 50N4E!","Stockholm, SWEDEN","Ludvig"

Its not a lot, but more than any other lambic Ive had.  The initial taste has a light sweetness with a decent tartness.  There is some funky oak, a bit of brandy, and some mushroom.

343,"2012-08-16",4.6,"Bottle shared by nerd. Thanks Michael!

The beer is slightly translucent and golden hued, with about a quarter inch of white, foamy head. Ah...the aroma. Cantillon has done it again, and I already know I am in for a treat. The nose brings big gueuze scents, classic Cantillon funk, straw, hay, light citrus. The flavor is phenomenal. I love what the cognac barrel has done here. The feel on the palate is just a bit fuller than the normal gueuze, with added complexity and depth from the cognac barrels. 

This is the second amazing cognac barrel-aged brew I have had this year. Im not necessarily a big fan of cognac, per se, but apparently, when done right, it can really invigorate a beer and add a wealth of complexity and flavor.

Flavor is pretty heavy cognac and then it falls back onto the gueuze. The acidity is pretty sharp. Mouthfeel is light and carbonation is low, some light heat from the cognac.

light hazed gold body with a small white head. mild but pleasant floral soap and fruit ester nose (peaches, mandarin orange, white grape) with mild acids. white grape juice flavor more so than cognac and oak, both light. light cork noticed throughout. sweetened tropical / pear juice with touches of apple and strawberry, all perfumed. oily and waxy texture, medium-thin body. seems a bit faded but its still pleasantly acidic and nuanced, though at this point its not the most complex cantillon ive had and not as good as my memory from 2008. second pour is much more expressive and more doughy, more minerallic and musty and complex, with soft touches of tart and dry raspberry and strawberry once again, but the cognac barrel is still largely muted.

Clear yellow pour with just a little bit of haze.  Wine grape, hay and pear nose, prickly, tart, spritzy, lively and festive.

Pours a nice red-orange color with some bright highlights when held up to the light. A thin white head graces the top along with a few bubbles around the edges. The nose comes at you with an incredible amount of funk--horse blanket, barnyard, wet leather, diapers, hay--whatever you want to call it, its there in abundance. Along for the ride are nice lactic notes with a slight acetic undertow. The cognac contributes a nice subtlety along with the oak. In the end, though, this is all about the funk.

The taste delivers at the same level with strong barnyard funk coming out strong straight out of the gate. There is a boozy cognac presence that really accentuates the sour components of this brew in what is just a fantastic job of blending and aging. I love the feel and the finish is superb. Thanks again to Eric for really going above and beyond, opening some world-class brews that I thought I would have to wait awhile to try, let alone having a single generous BA open them all in one night.

A: Dark golden body with hints of orange.  Slightly hazy.  Centimeter thick head on first pour which quickly evaporated into a spotty skim.  A stray wisp of foam here and there on the glass.
S: One of the more earthy-funky offerings Ive had to date from Cantillon.  Nice musty oak, wet straw, with some lemon cutting through the funk.  The cognac barrels add a bit of their character to the aroma.  Very nice.
T: The flavor profile carries the funk quite well.  One can imagine what the corner of a barn might be like on a damp, cool morning.  A bit of tartness comes in to complement the funk and must.  Cognac also lends just a hint of sweetness to the mix.
M: Medium bodied with a nice smooth effervesence.  Tartness and acidity are present but doesnt reach the extremity that Cantillon can reach with age.  
O: Drinking very well.  The flavor and aroma were quite complex and pleasing, perhaps just lacking a little bit more assertiveness.

Firm white head. Nose is sweet and sour, some grapey cognac notes and some horseblanket, farm, straw and a bit of tropical funk.

Cognac barrels, huh. Having never had cognac, 50N by 4E is my only point of reference. Cognac is apparently a puckering, lambic-like beverage with wild yeast byproducts. No wonder Cantillon decided to age one of their beers in these barrels.

Ah. Wikipedia tells me that cognac is made from distilled wine. But there isnt much grape or spirit flavor here.

There are white peaches and pear skins, though. Plus the yellow woodsorrel present in most of Cantillons catalog. And like their other lambics, 50N by 4E is moderately carbonated, generous with its wood, and pleasantly rank. But whats this in the finish, heat? In a lambic? Maybe some of that cognac rubbed off after all.","The Court of the Crimson King, California, USA","afrantzell"

343,"2010-07-25",3.8,"Sampled at the RBSG Summer Grand Tasting (Grand Rapids, MI). Pours a lightly hazed crisp darker gold, a small whitish ring on the edges, laces small. Aromas are rich sour lemons, lactic acid, a touch of booziness, warm oak and vanilla tannins, funky brett, fairly strong. Initial is mellower, a touch of honey, light lemony acidity, decent brett, wet oak. The cognac does shine through a bit, light, a touch hot. Acidity grows, lactic, lemons, lighter brett. A very nice lambic, a little too in your face for my liking, florals dandelions. Needs a touch more something, as it thinned out a bit. A mixed bag of tricks that I admittedly, did not love. Still, a very good beer overall, just not my preference from them. I need more lactic acidty and citrus and less seemingly boozy geuze and woodiness.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
343,"2010-06-10",3.7,"In short: A smooth straightforward dry woody lambic that feels more like an unblended than a Gueuze
How: Bottle 750ml at Delirium Café, Brussels
The look: Cloudy blonde body topped by a small off-white head
In long: Nose is moderately funky (a lot less than a regular Cantillon Gueuze for instance) with dusty notes.  Taste is dry, a bit funky, some sour green and red apples, dry wood, sawdust.  I did get a lot of wood but no cognac flavor in the beer.  Carbonation is sparse.  The beer is medium dry and the acidity/sourness level is rather low for the style.  The beer is very easy to drink but also very simple.  I found the first half of the bottle rather boring but things got a bit more interesting when the yeast joined in the party in the second half.  This beer resembles very much the unblended Cantillon Oude Lambik that I had a day or two before, only more woody.  Even the carbonation was similar to the Oude Lambik.  Does not resemble their Gueuze at all.  Ratebeer says this is a Gueuze but I strongly suspect that this is an unblended Oude Lambik aged in barrels.  IMHO the current high ratings are all because of rarity.  One of my least favorite Cantillon bottle.  Im going against the hype and Im trading my bottles.  Funny that they named the beer after the coordinates of their brewery.  I dont know what my longitude is, but I think I know my latitude.

343,"2010-04-29",4.7,"2007 Vintage. The cork eases out, perfectly spongy & in tact with a muted pop.. immediately the aroma of funk starts to emanate. Poured into gueuze tumblers with a robust, seafoam-like head with lingering retention. Nose is musty & bretty, reminiscent of a horse stable on a cool summer night. The bacteria has a pronounced and complex flavor, followed by the subtle undertone of cognac. The lambic essence is so deep and rich, the effort is perfectly executed with a touch of warmth on the back end.The barnyard resonance transcends into faint booziness, which could almost be confused as lingering oak from the barrel. If you observe closely, theres really something more here. The small nuances are what really puts this in distant perspective with other Cantillon Gueuze of the same vintage...made from the same loom, but certainly a different fabric.

Almost like something that came out of an urn. Nose is really complex, with not just the usual layers of funk and horseblanket but the distinctiveness of a very subtle cognac. Tastes quite ripe to start, almost like bakers yeast and grass or something, but over time a weirdly lactic taste emerges alongside the moderate heat from the cognac.

Orange-like fruitiness with hints of grapes in the nose. Some vinegar and tart apples. Plenty of funky notes - horse blanket, barn and wet hay. Some interesting notes of phenolic alcohol tickles the nose, might this be the cognac barrels revealing their presence? All in all, a very nice smell.

Its very easy to drink, considering that this is a beer from Cantillon. Tart citric notes and a nice wheat character up front in the mouth. Earth, yeast and grass are present, but rather restrained. Plenty of funky notes - horse blanket, wet dog and a hint of aged cheese. Some vinegar and some tart notes. In the mouth, there is really nothing extraordinary about this beer, but upon swallowing it truly excels. A wonderful mix of cognac and green apples appear, and it is really a fantastic taste. The taste of cognac is subtle but distinct, slightly phenolic with notes of oak barrel, raisins and butterscotch. Slightly boozy for just a hint of a second, and this is actually a pleasant experience during these circumstances. Then comes the apples with their wonderfully tart character. The finish is really long.

Medium carbonation, medium body with a smooth texture. Semi-dry finish.

I really like this one. A fantastic lambic with a rather unique character due to the cognac flavor. The cognac delivers a very sophisticated edge to the beer. Among the best beer Ive had from this fantastic brewery.

Rich if light caramel with a small light head. Splendid Cantillon aroma: tart leather and light wood. Cognac is understated but definitely there. An early grape sweetness from the cognac, tart apricots in the middle, dry cedar close. This is not one of the more powerfully sour Cantillons, and the funk is somehow restrained as well, dialed in both by the house character and by the addition of the cognac which slightly sweetens, deepens, and mellows the whole concoction. The result is a very accessible beer and also a spendid one; the cognac is subtle and well-integrated, not a BA-showoff in the least. Beautiful.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

343,"2009-04-04",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Dusty lambic funk massages this Lambics citrusy sourness, while white wine sweetness relaxes into a nearly oily sipper of a mouthfeel.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam surrounds the hazy blond.
-This does not taste like a lambic blend (so does not recall a Gueuze), but is rather redolent of a single lambic batch.
-This is sweeter than the usual Cantillon lambic, but balance is still achieved.
-Carbonation is quite low.

Notes of hay, dry grass and wild yeast funk go nicely with sour fruits and a subtle oak barrel finish. Not overly tart on the palate, but it delivers a pleasing amount of sourness.

A musty and barnyard yeasty nose along with notes of lemon and apricot, pipe tobacco, peat and minerals, and perhaps a touch of sweet liquor.

Final Impression: While really did not find much ado about Cognac, there does appear to be a roundness and uniqueness with this Lambic not normally found within the genre.

The pour yielded a nice hazy golden straw color, decent initial head, thinned to a ring, spotty if any lacing. The aroma was funky tart apples, grapes, and lemons, light leathery elements. The flavor was so excellent, this thing just melded together nicely, remained pleasantly drinkable (I even said it came across as a gueuze, so smooth, no idea that was the classification here). Wonderful notes of leather and the tartness worked for me, and this finished with a very mildly sweet touch in the finish. No, the sweetness wouldn’t be perceivable to the novice, but for a Cantillon brew, this had a very nice mild-balanced (for a lambic) finish, that was very pleasant. A solid and stellar brew, glad I was able to share with those that didn’t get the bottle. If only I had some more? Mouthfeel was spritzy, slightly less carbonated than other gueze brews, but moreso than a standard flat/still type lambic. Is this my favorite Cantillon? I think perhaps so.","","User37895"

343,"2008-09-01",4.1,"Murky golden yellow in colour with a thin quickly dissipating white coloured head, light lacing.

Tame by Cantillon standers, the barrel aging might have had something to do with this.  A very easy drinking Gueuze but I still prefer my Cantillons with a bit more oomph.

Mainly clear orange-yellow color, no head. Tropical fruits/apricot/peach and light tartness in the nose - not really cognac found here, but clearly unusual aroma for Cantillon gueuze.

343,"2008-05-09",4.0,"2007 cork Date; Sampled May 2008
Only lightly carbonated as a partially vigorous pour only produces a finger-thick, pale, barely off-white colored head.  The beer is a light honey color that shows a lightly hazed, golden-copper color when held up to the light.  The aroma smells sour of course, but has surprising backdrop of fruitiness to it; it smells of lightly, but distinctly of currants and berry-like notes in addition to more typical notes of tart apple, perhaps light pear and sour grapefruit.  Quite mellow barnyard aromatics, with some light mustiness and a touch of horse blanket.

Nicely sour tasting, but with more oak influence than one typically finds in Lambic.  The oak contributes more towards the end and finish of each sip with a spicy-oak component, a tannic woodiness and something a bit like warming alcohol (is that the cognac influence).  Tart fruit notes of sour grapefruit, green apple and not quite ripe, tart pears and not quite ripe chardonnay grapes.  This is exceedingly quaffable, my 750ml bottle of this is just easily disappearing down my throat; while light, the oak definitely gives this a structure and tannic texture.  The light, yet soft prickle of carbonation keeps this from being airy (like many a highly carbonated Gueuze).  Not as funky as many, still has a lasting, deep sourness, but also has an interesting, damp mustiness a slightly phenolic-cotton ball notes.

As the beer warms up and loses its carbonation a bit the unripe, green fruitiness becomes a bit more noticeable. Interestingly, besides a little warmth and the more noticeable oak notes, the Cognac seems to produce a chardonnay wine like flavor that is more fruity than anything, but has touches of flint to it.  The warming alcohol, Cognac influence becomes more noticeable too, with the vapors influencing the nasal passages during each sip.  Some tropical fruit influences even seem to take hold towards the end of this 750ml bottle; star fruit, and something vaguely like guava / papaya.  The nose has definitely picked up some warming alcohol notes as well as a touch of buttery oak and even a funky, sort of cheesy fruitiness.  The fruitiness even seems to accentuate a perception of sweetness, that just kisses the palate.

I am really surprised how mellow the barrel character is here, the cognac must have stripped out a lot of those oak flavors.  This is a very well balanced beer; the barrel plays a significant supporting role here, sourness of course takes the lead, but not excessively so (this is not as hard as some Cantillons) and the funk is definitely a supporting character.  I like that this was lightly carbonated, given that this is not a blended beer I was expecting a much flatter experience, but the soft carbonation definitely adds a nice touch to the texture.  Quite the tasty beer, I certainly wouldnt mind having a lot more of this in my cellar.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

343,"2008-04-20",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2010 From miketd and recently also shared by Maxxdaddy, thank to everyone.  The color seems a little bit more orange-ish than usual., has no head but a ring lacing.  At first I notice a difference compared to the regular, does not seem, to be as acidic in the nose (still strong though), a bit of leafy oak coming through (again different).  I get a bit of ""heat"" on the nose, not that I can directly call it a cognac aroma though.  Some marmalade sourness and sweet-less fruit.  taste is so subdued for Cantillon (almost at the Loerik level right now).  Not at all as mouth puckering as most Cantillon.  I get a good amount of earthy sourness but finishes only medium acidic (as opposed to a total onslaught).  So easy to drink for such a sour brew. The barrel has really tamed this puppy.750mL cap and cork (which was slimy and smelled weird), Rodenbach GC smaller tulip.Matt shared this recently and it isnt doing well, its very un-gueze-esque and a vegetal aroma, lifeless.  it has even a little bit of sweetness in the flavor, some light oxidation, and super weird in general.

343,"2007-04-26",4.2,"From a 750mL Bottle.  Slightly hazy, pale golden pour with a thin layer of wispy white head.  Mostly still, but some pale color is reformed with excitation.  A little bit of grassy herbal chracter freshens up a dry chardonnay tannin bouqet thats garnished with some sugar cane husks.  Refreshingly clean acidic characters.  Cognac is well hidden in the aroma, which seems like a wonderful thing for this fresh and earthy  incense.  Lightly bodied, gently carbonated mouthfeel with a prickling palate that uses the acidity of the wild yeasts to supplement the light carbonation.  Clean and acidic with a fantastically light body that keeps from getting excessively dry.  More acidic flavors of lightly musted leather and pinot grigio tannins.  Not really getting a whole lot of cognac characters, but at this point Im glad - the clean and resfreshingly sour light fruits are a masterpiece in and of themselves.  I generally hate cognac, but I love this beer.  Thanks for sharing, Chris!","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
343,"2007-03-31",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2007 Aroma comes forth as some strong apple sauce in a hazlenut pie. Not particularly unique, however expressive and glowing, with all the wonderful worlds that wild fermentation creates, however finding a little bit of glowing crispness now. Pours with middle deep gold and a touch of haze. Flavor lands amongst fall leave, bright woody grain and a bowl of Mississippi cotton. White grape juice brings up the background of the palate. Breathing, this beer yield the true meaning of the barrel, in that, to me, I cannot really taste the barrel or the cognac in the beer, itself with their respective individual notes or characters. Instead, I can sense, deeply, that the barrel and the cognac has made this a better lambic, my mellowing, melding and bringing a new sense to an old favorite. Masterful and bold. A treat to try and my favorite of the night. Beer parts with a wisp of fresh pink grapefruit and a branch of a cherry tree. Thanks to whomever provided this fantastic beer.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

343,"2005-12-01",3.5,"Bottle, at the London gathering, November 2005. For the very reason that Silk found this beer far more palatable than most lambics, I found this less appealing. A Cantillon wouldnt be a Cantillon without lots of lemony tartness, but its much more mellow than the norm. I never thought Id use a word like smooth in relation to a Cantillon but Im almost tempted to here. It also had less funky farmyard goings on than its brothers. And, as usual when a beer is advertised has having something added, I didnt really pick up the brandy. Its still a good beer in my book but its not the wild child that other Cantillons are.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

I thought that I had got this beer wrong as my original notes say ""sweet acidity,"" which makes no logical sense.  However, having mulled this over with Silk, we agreed that it does have a sweet and sour mix going on in the mouth.  Some stewed apple/lemon flavour.  Bit of farmyard funk on the nose.  Good pure lemon juice finish. 4.3/5  Bottle at brewery.  Hazy gold, ring of white bubbles, woody cognac toffee aroma,   Earty on aorma, you can still smell the barrel.  Wow, the cognac adds a touch of sweetness.  Nougat on aroma.  Like a dry dessert wine.  Wow, speechless, I am without speech.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

A Cantillon that is balanced. And boy, how wonderful this is. The missing link - the harmony and interest and, yes, complexity, that comes from opposing notes of sour/dry and sweet. Damp straw. Some sharpness, yet softly enveloped. Mmmm. Note of thanks to Harrisoni for persuading me to try this.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

343,"2005-08-08",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 10, 2005 Huge thanks to Eyedrinkale.  I still cant believe I got the chance to try this one.Bottled 2004 says the cork but Im not sure which batch it was.Shared this with EDA on 8/5/05.  Pour is darker than usual for a cantillon lambic, quite hazy as well.  Its got sort of a very ripe orange-peach color, but also a tinge of kiwi-skin (sort of a drab brownish-olive-orange).  In the aroma, there are all sorts of funky things to be found.  Moldy barns, wet, farmy hay and sour acids.  Lactic notes, but a good hint of something sweet as well.  Really quite strong and forceful, though I cant say I find anything in the aroma that would suggest cognac.  The flavor begins with a huge sourness and tons of acid.  Its got a big body, full of light malt (light and moderately sugary/sweet), abundant wheat and dry, earthy notes.  Lots of bacteria in this stuff, its all over the place, from cheesy, to farmy and then on to musty.  Really pleasing, and just the slightest hint of effervescence to tickle the throat as it glides down.  In wonderful condition.  The finish shows a touch of sugariness, then a dry, almost peaty/smoke note with sharp alcohol, but it is quite faint and I can barely make the connection with cognac when trying.  I would never notice cognac having tasted this blind.  Tartness really grows and a pleasant wet woodiness sits in.  Unlike the Cantillon Gueuze, with much more focus on earthy/woody notes and much more of a lean towards tartness than sourness, as Jeppe points out.  I also found the body bigger, more sweet (which was a really enjoyable, as you dont get that much in Cantillon) and just more rounded and drinkable.  Kind of like the dark saison of lambics.  A great example, really puts the 2003 bottles of Grand Bruocsela to shame, IMHO.  I dont know about that cognac though, must have disappeared with the aging.  Thanks again, Mike!","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
