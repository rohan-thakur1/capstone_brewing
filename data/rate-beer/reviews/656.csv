656,"2017-06-18",4.4,"0.355l bottle thanks to Cristobal37. Vintage 2015. Hazy dark ruby body with an orangish light brown head. Aroma of whiskey, vanilla, raisins, wood, cloves and burnt sugar. Taste of toast, whiskey, raisins, chocolate, wood and a nice amount of floral hops. Great beer.","Budapest, HUNGARY","kapusil"
656,"2017-06-17",4.3,"12 ounce bottle into snifter, bottled on 9/22/2016. Pours hazy very dark reddish brown color with a 1-2 finger dense and rocky light khaki head with awesome retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, and date; with lighter notes of chocolate, leather, tobacco, smoke, herbal, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready/light roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and fruity yeast notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, brown bread, raisin, plum, fig, cherry, and date; with lighter notes of chocolate, leather, tobacco, smoke, herbal, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness. Light herbal bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, brown bread, leather, tobacco, light smoke, herbal, and yeast/oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and fruity yeast flavors; with a great malt/bitter/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light dryness from bitter/spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/silky, and lightly sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is great. Minimal warming alcohol for 11.2%, with no barrel booziness. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged scotch ale. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready/light roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
656,"2017-06-16",4.3,"Bottle, 355 ml. Pours dark reddish-brown, very cloudy, thin sheen of soapy light tan head, patchy lacing, no visible carb.

Taste is sweet, malty, cakey, with dried fruits, muscavado sugar, candied orange, blood orange around the edges, dark chocolate, cinnamon, dark caramel malts, very rich.

Light on the alcohol and nicely malty yet not overly so/cloying. Not much oxidation, if any, either, which is surprising, given this is 18 months old. Light brown bread, bits of fig and date-like notes, though this is pretty low on the fruitiness/English aspects, overall.In the mouth its nicely attenuated though still provides ample malt texture as well as notes of caramel, toffee, fig, date, vanilla and honey. The barrel adds spicy whiskey, very dry prunes and lots of pepper character which balances the malt character nicely. Low carbonation, fairly engaging with very low alcohol for this high an abv. Some warmth and light esters, but otherwise well-controlled. Good expression/flavor on the barrel-aging and thankfully the beer is pretty well-attenuated.  I think a lot of this has come from letting the beer sit.  Its still a bit devoid of overall personality and retains some alcohol and sharpness (inevitable at this level of abv), as well as being a bit dominant in the barrel character.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

656,"2017-01-26",4.1,"355 ml bottle at abv 11.1% bought at HK Brewcraft in central.
Looks: Clear, deep burgundy colour; Less than one-quarter finger head with residual soapy light beige foam which fades in 15 seconds; Very good sticky lacing with near zero carbonation.

Aroma: Very fragrant and intense Bourbon which can be smelt as soon as it was popped, with dark malt, strong vanilla, strong oak barrel, liquorices, strong caramel and toffee, steamed crab meat, strong roasted barley, dark fruits, light butter scotch, strong brown sugar and light grass. Wow! 

Taste: Strong sweet full dark malt, with strong roastyness, strong smooth vanilla, Bourbon, strong liquorices, strong caramel, toffee, strong oak barrel, dark fruits, floral, sugar, strong spices, biscuits, lemon, strong bitter hops and grass. Excellent!

Body: Full body. Very slick and oily palate.

Mouth Feel: Full dark malt in a thick and quite oily background. Fine oak barrels with incredibly silky vanilla, strong but nice Bourbon with sharp liquorices, complemented by good roastyness, strong caramel, dark fruits, floral and strong spices. Sugary but balanced the strong booze pretty well. Biscuity with strong lemon to round. Complex and nice!

Alcohol: the 11% booze seems daunting with that sake-like stream crab aroma. It still means business in taste but the hard liquor element is somewhat mellowed by smooth vanilla to grind out any harshness. Great stuff! 

Hoppiness: Light grass in nose. Floral, strong spices, lemon and grass in taste; Bitterness - liquorices and hops - is strong and shrap for a lasting, high astringent sweet boozy malty finish.

After taste: Fairly dry. Sweet bitter and very boozy to mouth.

Comments: A powered-up version of Dirty Bastard, this ones barrels enhance the Ale with smooth, lively vanilla and tasty oaks. Bourbon is assertive but not as overbearing as most barreled Ales. Fruity, spicy and malty at all fronts, a great sipper for cold winter nights. Cheers!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

Had been wanting to try this one for a long time. Finally saw it in stores for the first time at Bine & Vine. Wanted to get just a 12-oz. bottle, but they only had them in 4-packs. Ended up pulling the trigger for $14.99, picking up the last one. The label says it all - Scotch-Style Aged in Oak Bourbon Barrels.

Poured a dark brown-to-light-black color with two fingers of khaki-tan frothy head. A few bubble streams coming up at various points on the glass. World-class spiderweb foamy lacing. Excellent retention. (Sight - 4.50)

Smelled a mix of boozy bourbon and deep oaky notes. Wow, very appealing. Digging deeper got vanilla, caramel, toffee, leathery tobacco, raisins, dates, oak chips, cocoa, sticky dark fruits and Whoppers candy. Cooled down on the nose as it went down. Really had me wanting to try it. (Smell - 4.50) 

Tasted very similar to the nose, but maybe not quite as good. Getting woody oak chips, smooth bourbon, subdued vanilla, raisins, dates, some earthy tobacco, cocoa, bitter dark chocolate, roasty malts, more dark fruits (plum?), caramel malts, touch of brown sugar, still getting Whoppers candy, maybe the malted chocolate, and toasted toffee. Wow, feeling that 11.2 pct. warming down my stomach. This is wonderful. (Taste - 4.25)

Taste is similarly sweet with caramel & dark fruit combo upon arrival (raisins, black grapes, candied cherries, figs). Solid malt middle with some earthy, soft smoky, and spicy notes to make the flavors close to a fruit pastry. Finishes with a balanced showing off its boozy strength and bourbon barrel characters (vanilla & roasted nuts). The end notes stand out over time. Smooth texture & a heavy body; no carbonation, dry finish, & astringent with booze after it warms up. Complex and delicious, one of the best to come out of Founders for sure.

Its got nearly no head and a dark brown body with flecks of ruby. A few bubbles and a ring around the surface show the only signs of life.

Smells of Bourbon and lots of it. When its cold, it only smells of bourbon and charred oak. As it warms, it smells significantly better. The malt character comes through as caramel and burnt sugar. 

Bourbon and oak again in the flavor. Bitterness, too. Maybe from the oak or maybe from the hops, not sure. Again, the malt profile doesnt shine until it warms. When it does, its a lot of rich sugars. Not complex, but good.

Hot for sure. You taste all of the 10.2%. The carbonation keeps it from being syrupy. Still slow drinking from the booze.

 Data butelkowania:  24.09.2015 
 Kolor:  Brązowy z rubinowymi refleksami pod światło. Piwo jest czyściutkie jak łza.
 Piana:  Żółto-kremowa, delikatna, ciężka do obserwacji, ponieważ szybko ulatni się.
Przy przechylaniu szkła pozostają liczne smugi na ściankach.
Piana kurczy się do smukłego kożuszka.
Przez cały czas degustacji pojawiają się jej ślady na szkle. 
 Zapach: Potężna, gigantyczna nuta wanili z lekkim kokosem w tle. Wanilia wydaje się początkowo być wszechobecna i przykrywać swoim aromatem piwo bazowe.
Po chwilowym zaklimatyzowaniu się kubków smakowych powoli do nosa zaczynają docierać kolejne składowe takie jak: karmel, toffi, nuty przypieczonego chleba, ciasteczek z kawałkami karmelu, czy ciastek Piegusek z cząstkami czekolady.
Aromat jest wybitnie słodowy i bardzo głęboki.
Piwo pachnie jak słodki deser polany karmelem! 
 Smak: Bardzo podobnie jak w aromacie. Niekończąca się eksplozja wanilii, nuty dębowej beczki, orzechów, toffi i ciemnego pieczywa.
Dalej odrobina ciemnych owoców: suszone śliwki i rodzynki.
Można też odnieść wrażenie, że pojawia się sugestia słodów palonych.
Ogromna porcja karmelu wspaniale komponuje się z wanilią tworząc wrażenie słodkiego płynnego deseru. Goryczka jest średniej maści, jest krótka i tylko delikatnie poszczypuje w język. Finisz jest słodko-gorzki. Zero posmaków alkoholowych. Delikatne rozgrzewanie balansuje słodową słodycz. 
Faktura pełna, ale nie ulepkowata. Piwo jest gęste, zbite i oleiste. Idelany balans poszczególnych składowych.
Wzorowe Scotch Ale, bez najmniejszych wątpliwości. 
 Wysycenie:  Średnie.
 Podsumowanie:  

Najlepsze Scotch Ale jakie miałem okazję pić w swoim życiu. 

Piwo jest po ponad rocznym leżakowaniu. Dało to wszechobecne, GIGANTYCZNE (muszę to podkreślić) nuty wanilii, mokrego drewna, dębiny i dosłownie szczyptę kokosu.
Wanilia chwilami dominuje piwo bazowe, ale w żadnym wypadku mi to nie przeszkadza.
Backwoods Bastards jest zdecydownie piwem słodowym z akcentami: ciemnych owoców (śliwki, rodzynki), toffi, ciemnego pieczywa, delikatnymi słodami palonymi.
Karmel jest pierwszym po wanilii i dębinie najmocniej wyczuwalnym składnikiem.
Arcymistrzowskie ukrycie prawie 12% alkoholu.
Bogate smakowo i zapachowo o solidnej pełnej fakturze.

Pamiętam, że zapłaciłem za to piwo w UK £5.7, przy obecnym kursie funta koszt jednej buteleczki wychodzi poniżej 30 zł.
Piwo zdecydowanie warte jest znacznie wyższej ceny.","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

Rich deep sweet and melting on the tongue is a good way to describe how this tastes. Its thick and oily, a tad sticky as well in the mouth while its gently carbonated with those small prickling bubbles. There is a good amount of burned caramelly sugars, a malt toffee sweetness with tones of both coffee, vanilla, a ton of bourbon, nut essens and rye bread.

656,"2015-12-21",4.6,"Scotch Ales tend to be big, but Founders Backwoods Bastard may be the biggest of them all. Weighing in at 11.6% ABV (the 2015 edition, that is) and aged in bourbon barrels; its safe to say this is a beastly brew. Though for such a behemoth, its remarkably tame. The palette is delicious and the deliver is smooth and warming. In a world obsessed with imperial stouts and IPAs, this is a hidden gem in your beer store.

I poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. It was bottled on 9/26/15 and cost $4.39 ($0.37 per ounce).

Appearance: Gorgeous cherry red hue; looks almost like red wine. Body is fairly clear but dark. Initially pours to a large, dark tan, foamy head but it mostly fades and leaves only minor lacing.

Smell: Lovely sweetness of maraschino cherries and bourbon. Theres a strong malt presence as well. Alcohol is noticeable, but not distracting.

Taste: Every once in a while Ill have a beer from a style I dont usually think of as being among my favorites and itll amaze me. This is one of those beers. The palette is simply delicious: sweet to be sure, but nothing artificial or even remotely cloying about it. Much like the nose, the taste is largely dark fruit: rum-soaked raisin, cherries and figs along with confectionery sweetness of caramel and toffee. The bourbon emerges on the finish in the form of both a sweet, oaky, vanilla sensation as well as alcohol. Though not especially bitter, it doesnt come off as unbalanced or hot. This may be the best Scotch Ale Ive ever had, though it might also be considered an Old Ale since its aged in bourbon barrels. Perhaps its the best of both worlds?

Drinkability: Theres no such thing as cold winters night here in Florida, but Founders Backwoods Bastard definitely is the kind of brew Id recommend for an evening of staying in. The 11.6% ABV potency is apparent, but subtle enough that its part of the natural presentation of the brew. Warm to be sure with a lingering sensation in the throat after the first few swigs. It eventually becomes a smooth, thick, and surprisingly clean-finishing sipper. I couldve drank an entire bomber of this solo. Dont pair this with anything  drink it on a clean palate and savor it.

Appearance: Both a deep amber red/ brown, with minimal khaki foam head. 2015 version is almost perfectly clear, while the 2014 is noticeably murky and cloudy. 
Aroma: 2014: Rich oak and cherry dominate, with smoky tobacco and a touch of vanilla. 2015: A strong woody oak aroma with high vanilla and smoky notes. The cherry and tobacco notes picked up on the aged 2014 not present in the fresh 2015 version. 
Taste: 2014: Rich maltiness with strong cherrywood flavor, giving way to a distinct coconut and vanilla. Bitterness barely there. 2015: A strong punch of fresh oak wood and vanilla, with those flavors much stronger than the 2014 version.

Mouthfeel: 2014: Medium body with light creaminess and low carbonation and a touch of alcohol warmth. 2015: Medium body with a more syrupy character than 2014. Missing 2014 creaminess. Carbonation low, with a similar alcohol warmth. 
Finish: 2014: Leaves a malty finish with lingering cherry and coconut. 2015: Very malty on the finish with a lingering vanilla bean flavor. 
Overall: Cant go wrong with either, both are amazing, but I prefer the 2014 aged version to the fresh 2015. 2014 has developed a softer melding of all the rich scotch ale and oak barrel flavors, with the development of dark fruit, cherry, coconut, and tobacco notes not found in the 2015. 2015 has a much sharper taste profile with fresh woody and strong vanilla that are present but subdued in the 2014 version. My advice, this is beer that is definitely better with some age on it.","","TH28"

If you open this fresh I feel like the bourbon will help balance this. Right now this is crazy sweet. Almost to the point of cloying but not quite. I guess I needed to have a fresh sample and then a year old vintage. Right this second the dark fruit over powers the bourbon and gives this a ""barley wine "" like flavor. But dont get me wrong... This is still wonderful. Bourbon and sweetness provides a ton of flavor. Another big plus in this brew is the alcohol is totally hidden.

(recently tried Brewfist Spaghetti Western Grappa Barrel, and I believe that the aging had opposite effect on Brewfist beer, making it worse). A bit of good old ethanol and Vana Tallinn in the taste - actually, if you take any local Estonian porter, and drink it together you will have somewhat remotely similar feeling. Medium bodied, slick and gently carbonated. Does goes quite flat by the end of glass. Some moldy aftertaste in the last sips (lets assume it is aging). A perfect brew nonetheless.

The taste is a medium-high sweet with a medium bitterness. The texture is viscous and sticky with a soft, fuzzy carbonation. The full malt body is filled out by notes of cherry, caramel, and oak with an earthy, ashy, and lightly spicy finish all with a light touch of alcohol warmth. The aftertaste starts of strong, but fades quickly, and cleans up nicely, echoing notes of caramel and oak, with an earthy character to it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Rich and deep aroma just a like its promised in the splash page for the brew, lots of malt and some chocolate cherry like character with obvious oak and bourbon.

Smooth on the palate with light effervescence that does build slightly. Magical, peaty character well in balance with malts.

While this is a sipper at 10%+ ABV I could definitely enjoy this (very slowly) all night.

656,"2014-11-11",4.6,"12 oz bottle, poured into a nonic pint at room temperature.

A: Pours looking very similar to Coke. Once in the glass, it becomes a deep, clear hickory brown with a ruddy tint. The head is thin and dissipates swiftly, leaving an off-white ring around the edge of the glass. What lacing forms, forms to stay.

S: Bourbon swirls up out of the glass, and its a bourbon type that has oak, vanilla, almonds, walnuts, and some spices I cant pick out along. I half wonder if theyre using barrels from the Heaven Hill or Buffalo Trace distilleries. Underneath the liquor smells, theres caramel and toffee, dancing around the edges.

T: This tastes of yes and victory, with hints of expletive and invective. Sweet toffee-caramel malt swirls in across the palate, bringing with it the vanilla and nuttiness from the nose, before a warm, boozy glow washes through the background with the wooden and spice notes. Theres a hint of bourbon warmth as it goes down, and the finish is pure oak-vanilla-booze. Theres just enough of an earthy tinge throughout to be noticeable.

M: Creamy, full, and rich, without a surfeit of carbonation to distract one from the abundant flavors.

O: I am a fan of bourbon, and a fan of the Dirty Bastard - as such, this makes for quite a beer for me. This 2014 bottle is the first time Ive had the pleasure of tasting this since a Founders tap takeover at Fries Cafe around 2011 or so, and that may well be too long a span to go without this in my life.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Vanilla bourbon flavors are molded into a lascivious mouthfeel heated up by alcohol heat and lingering wood.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam decorates the darkest ruby.
-The mouthfeel is rich, yes, but the supple carbonation makes it become an elegant dessert.
-The flavor profile is rather linear. Malts arent as deep as I like in this style (overtaken by the barrel treatment, probably?)
-Licorice-like sugared fruitiness appears after a while.

656,"2014-05-19",3.8,"Transfer from BA review from 2-7-12 

Poured from bottle into tulip shaped glass

Appearance  Pours a mahogany-deep red color. There is a very mild off white head formed upon pouring with only a bit of lacing upon the heads dissipation. 

Smell  Sweeter aromas first meet the nose of dark fruits mixed with a little bit of caramel. A slight amount of bourbon works its way in the middle with a little bit of alcohol mixing with the bourbon and fruit; rounding out the smell profile at the very end.

Taste  Up front a nice complex dark fruit flavor, composed mainly of a cherry base (yet mixed in with some prune and raisin as well), is mixed with a slight amount of caramel malt flavor. There is an ever so slight bourbon that works its way into the taste profile. The alcohol then comes into play and mixing with the light bourbon and finishes out the taste profile. A nice flavor but a bit lacking in the barrel flavor that I desire.

Mouthfeel  For the high abv of the brew it is quite thin in body. The carbonation is just right, and this combined with the thinner body make it easy to drink. The one thing that holds one back, however, from downing this beer, is the slight tingle one gets from the alcohol, which helps keep you in check. Actually it all works together surprisingly well.

Overall - It is a good beer, but in some ways unbalanced for its style in my mind (i.e. thin body and lack of great bourbon flavor vs. its high abv and alcohol flavor). Good, but not great.","","Darkmagus82"

Smooth bourbon taste (without any boozy heat) and heavy oak are the dominant flavors early, with the typical scotch ale notes of light caramel and toasted malt in the background. The dry woody tone grows midway through the brew, and is joined by a flour-heavy, raw dough flavor, and a hint of peanut butter and raspberries. The beer is pretty darn close to still and oxidation is fairly apparent throughout. I think this one is a bit past its prime.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"

Smells like an open cigar box, and much more barrel than in last year's batch. Can't get over how different this is from the 2012. Oaky, mild boozy sweetness, plenty of bourbon character, quick tinge from the alcohol at the end. Improves significantly as it warms.

656,"2013-12-04",4.6,"Had this last year and remembered loving it. Poured into a snifter..
A: Oaky. Boozy. Molasis note. yes..... not bad but not very complex.
A: Pours decently thick especially watching the bubbles rise. Little head. Nice semi transparent brown color.
T: First thought is something like oh my god this is amazing. As the beer finishes the thought continues only more so. If ever a beer was a 10 in taste this is it. Molasses sweetness. Dates. Alcohol cuts through but is more warming and surprising that aggressive. Oaky. Boozy. Finish has a huge bit of malt which is crazy for a beer this strong. Goes down with almost a brandy-like warmth. Just insane. yeah theres some carmel in there as well when the beer warms.
P: Feels smooth on the palate. Carbonation is on the money. Flavor development is also amazing. Goes through many different stages. As mentioned before the alcohol cuts though but not in a bad way, more to remind you that its there.

This beer is simply amazing. The tastes is complex, the palate is great. The weird thing is it doesnt smell that great. Oak and boozy are really the big smell notes. But this one hits where it counts: a must try. (How can it be an overall 20 when the smell is a 7? IDK the sum of the parts is less than the whole?)","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Jamesthebrit"

656,"2013-11-01",4.5,"On draft at Founders. Pours into a snifter with a gorgeous ruby color. The thin head dissipates quickly and leaves minimal lacing. The aroma is gorgeous. There are some hints of licorice and dark fruits, but the caramel, hints of vanilla, and the bourbon mixes delightfully. The flavor is equally as good. A prefect maltiness, with the caramel and the bourbon meshing into the fruitiness. This is substantially better than the first one I'd tried. Amazing.

656,"2013-11-01",4.5,"12 oz. bottle poured into a snifter. Appearance is a hazy ruby-brown color, much like cola. Aroma is incredibly rich malts, caramel, dark fruits (plums and raisins), toffee, warm booze, and a hint of vanilla. There arent enough words to describe how rich this smells. At first, the taste is similar to the scent, but less rich and with more prominent vanilla. However, the aftertaste is very much smooth, warm bourbon and vanilla. That lingering aftertaste is just incredible. Its definitely a sipper, though. I didnt know what to expect from Founders on this one, but Im not disappointed.","Lansing, Michigan, USA","marv3mania"

Earthy grain and dark fruit. This beer has every malt sweetness on the nose. Caramel, toffee, sugar. Fragrant vanilla and dark fruits. The taste is charming. Smooth and creamy body that boasts a sweet richness. The fruits are dried dates, raisins and figs. The vanilla adds smoothness and the bourbon enhances the lush sweetness. It finishes dry and pleasantly boozy. Has an earthy peat character underneath that offsets all the sweetness so it is not cloying.

It has an amazingly delicious nose of dark, sweet fruits (figs, maybe dates) and perfect malty brown malts. Godly aroma. its really delectable in the mouth, sweet and darkly fruity with notes of wood and Scotland. Its almost like candy, but more like candied fruit. Apples maybe. pears maybe. Figs and dates definitely.
An amazing beer. And the finish is just enough of a tease that you really have to watch yourself when you drink this. Its like candy for burly Scotsmen. And my belly.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

656,"2013-09-09",4.0,"On-tap at the World Expo of Beer in Frankenmuth, Michigan.

Appearance: Darkness. A few bubbles on top, no lacing, and just a pitch black beer -- about what I expected this beer to look like.

Smell: Huge scotch and oak aromas... maybe some dark sort of chocolate malt notes, but mainly oaky scotch.

Taste: A couple people I was with claimed it tasted like liquid smoke and dumped it out, but I quite enjoyed this one -- it tastes almost exactly like it smells. It drinks almost like straight scotch with some warming on the finish, but there isnt a HUGE alcohol sort of flavor. The finish is also woody with some dark chocolate and malt to round it all out.

656,"2013-06-14",4.8,"Founders Backwards Bastard, aged 6 months in my fridge (yes, I am drinking it fresh), 10.2% ABV, a 12oz bottle and poured into a snifter glass.
Appearance: Poured deep ruby brown with a very little head and lacing.
Smell:  Sweet caramel and smoky malt with a hint of vanilla, no pronounced hop presence, no obvious off flavors.
Taste:  Candied dates and baking chocolate.  There is also a spicy and earthy aftertaste that I attribute to the oak bourbon barrels used in the aging process and the 50 IBUs of hop flavor.
Mouth feel:  Medium to full body and low carbonation.  The bitter sweetness clings to the upper palette.  There is definitely an umami effect as I keep running my tongue along my upper palette.  Also a nice warming alcohol finish.
Overall: Founders has been making great beer for over 20 years.  Backwards Bastard is an amazingly subtle yet complex beer.  You will find the flavor change with each sip as the beer warms and the taste lingers.  You can drink this with almost any rich food and meal course; from roasted garlic Portobello mushrooms, to a medium-rare rib eye, or a flourless chocolate raspberry cake.  But why wait for the food.

She changes personalities as she warms up. Bourbon up front, vanilla and oak. Caramel notes, but a well balanced sweetness. For such a big beer its relatively medium bodied.

656,"2013-01-18",4.0,"Aroma is dominated by rich caramel notes, both light and dark caramel. There is also some toffee and a light chocolate aroma. Aroma has above amount of vanilla with some oak present as well. No hop aroma. Low to medium, but clean alcohol aroma. Some carmelized fig and raisin notes as well. Also some dark cherry notes if you take a deep breath. 
Pours a dark brown with some ruby highlights on the edges. A thin, dark tan head recedes fairly quickly leaving a film on the edges. Light lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is similar to the aroma. Lots of sweet caramel of varying darkness. Light toffee and chocolate notes as well as a faint smokiness. The flavor has more oak than the aroma but the vanilla is still present as well. Some raisin notes and carmelized fruit. No hop flavor but moderate bitterness. A medium amount of alcohol and low oak character in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodies with medium low carbonation. Alcohol warmth is moderate and astringency is low. 
Overall this is a very good beer. I am enjoying it more than I remembered liking it. The complex caramel character works nicely with the oak and vanilla notes from the barrel.

A: Pours a deep chestnut brown--very formidable looking. Very marginal lacing.

T: My first impression is that isnt as sweet as I would have believed. It is more woody bourbony than anything. There is bitterness but it is only to tamp the more agressive aspects of this beer. As it warms, it gets more assertively smoky and also picks up a meaty aspect. Overall, I dig this beer. However, I believe it is toned down from last year. It could do with a bit more complexity.

656,"2012-12-14",3.7,"This beloved beer, is one that I have had a very good number of times by way of small 1 to 3oz samples served on draught at the bar where I work. The reason why Ive tried it so many times is because honestly Im a little amazed that what Im tasting when I take a sample of it could ever be a beer rated within the 99th percentile on Ratebeer. To put it shortly Ive been up till this point wholly unimpressed with my encounters with this beer.
When I spotted single bottles for sale at a local liquor shop I decided that perhaps Im drinking too little of the beer, too fast, and at too low a temperature... perhaps the 3oz taster glass is a poor receptacle for the beer.... So I sank the $3.50 so that at the very least I could drive the nail into the coffin and proclaim that I never want to drink the beer again, or adversely find that through serving the beer the beer properly in a tulip glass, at a cellar temperature, and with enough volume to wrap my head around any before missed subtitles that I may experience what so many others seem to love about this beer. 

The color of the beer is really quite beautiful, a very deep reddish orange, the head is small, but well retained. 
 
I will admit that the aroma is inviting and far more pronounced at the higher serving temperature. Initially out of the bottle rich woody, boozy, and vanilla bourbon notes were dominant. But while the glass sits these notes become more subdued (although they never go away). The beer is sweet and boozy smelling with cherries, toffee, and toasted nuts. 

My goodness the flavor of this beer is a different animal from the bottle at cellar temperature. Far less brash with much more character. Yes it is still a tad on the sweet and boozy side for what I generally prefer, but the beer is still nice. Vanilla, whiskey, mild spice, dark sweet cherries, woodiness, red apple skins, and light smoke are enjoyable and satisfying notes. There is something familiar about the beer that I cant put my finger on, but I think it might be akin to cavendish tobacco. 

The beer is too sweet and boozy for me to really love, but its weird... I like some beers that are sweeter and/or boozier than this one. The other elements... while good, are maybe not fantastic enough to overly wow me, but I must say I do enjoy the beer, and propa serving technique meant the world for the aroma and flavor of this beer. 

I admit, I understand the appeal now... and this makes for a fantastic nightcap.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

656,"2012-12-06",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 19, 2015 Update: Dec 2015
I dont know if they have changed anything from earlier years, but this is working much more beautifully for me now. Gorgeous stewed dates, prunes, caramel, licorice, vanilla, and a beautifully spicy, boozy woody edge in the aroma translate into sumptuously caramely, fruity, vanilla-oaky goodness in the mouth. Sweet malty and fruity flavors are rounded out by the wood, for a slightly acidic, boozy, earthy, spicy, dry finale. Beautiful and much more balanced than I remembered it being.

Original rating (Dec 2011 and Dec 2012): 7/4/8/4/14
It pours a deep, translucent mahogany without much of a head  only a thin bone-colored foam shows up momentarily and quickly dissipates. The aroma is caramel, vanilla, brown sugar, licorice and wood sustained by a strong backbone of ethanol. Its super boozy, to say the least. Silky mouthfeel with minimal carbonation. The taste is mainly caramel, brown sugar, and malted grain up front, with a dry, earthy, woody scotch aftertaste. It greets the stomach with soothing warmth.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

I was in a beer store and in a hurry. I rarely spend half this much on beer, so I guess the label got me. Lesson learned. Bottle. Deep brown body with a little garnet at the edges. There is a thin light tan head. The nose has some strong caramel and marshmellow candy. There is also a bit of bourbon and vanilla sweetness. This has a slight hint of wood. Otherwise, it is candy sweet. The taste is woody boozy caramel and leather. There is also a hint of hay in the finish. A little dusty. A warming boozy brew that is like sugared up scotch and wood. The barrel aging dominates and that is not a good thing. Wow, this is an overpriced mess. I guess its for the scotch ale lovers and those that love barrel aging regardless of the results. A purchase I immediately regretted and tasting did not change my attitude.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

Now that said thats exactly what philosophy I stick too. However, as much of a pain in the ass it was to find , the reviews of the Bastard made me curious. So foregoing against my better nature I was in the right place at the right time and was able to procure a couple of 4 packs. Well hell, I admit it is pretty damn good.

Backwoods Bastard pours a dark cherry brown color; there is a nice tint where the light sneaks through in the edge of the glass.  A bit of sediment gradually sinks to the bottom of the glass, and there is not much head to speak of on top.

Bourbon definitely comes through in the aroma.  Bourbon and oak coat a very malty base beer.  Caramel, maple, and smooth grains provide the base aroma.  

The flavor is strong, smooth, and reminds me of a bourbon barrel old ale (in a good way).  The bourbon is noticeable first, with sweet caramel, raisins, with a bit of molasses, peat, cocoa powder, and hazelnut as well.

The body is full and rich, with carbonation on the low side.  There is a very light alcohol burn on my tongue and in my throat, but I expect this in a 10% Wee Heavy.  There is a little bit of oily residue behind my lips after each sip.

A - Pours a dark red/brown body that almost appears purple. This particular bottle is chill hazed with some floating protein particles. Ive had many bottles of this batch that were crystal clear though. Three fingers worth of tan foam fades away into a patchy cap with attractive silky bubbles. Sticky lacing with modest retention.

S - Such an amazing and inviting aroma. Gobs of rich and sweet english toffee with layers of vanilla, butterscotch, and oak. Brown sugar drenched raisins. Such a fantastic bourbon presence. 

T - Sweet toffee malts. Rich brown sugar and dates. Smooth bourbon with a noticeable but pleasant alcohol burn. Finishes with some butterscotch, vanilla oak and a touch of peat. Excellent.

Game over. Now, I pine for the day that I can ""happen upon"" the KBS or CBS, or make a pilgrimage to the brewery. And, Ill have the beercation, soon.

S: 5.0. Where has this taste been all of my life? I was weaned on Jack Daniels and have recently found Makers Mark to be the ultimate in a good drink. But, to find a beer that provides the bourbon taste without being too boozy or too pretentuous? This changed everything.

T: 5.0. Everything that I look for in a superior taste ... with each sip, I would pause my conversation, say ""wow"" and then relax for a moment. 

M 4.0. The taste the experience and the flavor made the mouthfeel darn near perfec.

Smells of caramel, chocolate, oak, licorice, molasses. This is a full nose for sure. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy, almost chewable. Yet there was a slight crispness to it. Flavor is of syrup, booze, some woodsy notes, and big bourbon smack. This wasnt what I expected at all. Way too boozy and thick for my liking. Interesting beer.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"
656,"2012-04-19",4.0,"This beer has the pure aroma of bourbon.  Smells fantastic!  Pours a deep brown/amber... almost matches the color of the bottle perfectly.  Very little to no head, just a touch around the edge of the glass.  Bourbon is apparent at first sip.  Alcohol is mostly covered up, but a bit of heat does come through.  A tiny bit of sweetness is in no way overwhelming and balances nicely with a bit of hops that comes through on the back.  Has a wood-like taste that is pleasant.  Overall a great sipper, very delicious.  Its a little bit ale and a little bit stout-like.","West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA","Jayklew"

The taste was a scotch alcohol assault similar to the scent. However, a sweet, cream and caramel persisted that reminded me of those cow tail candies gas stations all seem to sell (which I liked).

With two of these in the cellar I was glad to open one now and save the other for later. This is a very strong beer with lots of depth. Id expect nothing less from a quality brewery like Founders. While I would not go out of my way to get more once they gone I also would consider picking up another if it was on the shelf.

Aroma / Appearance - The dense head collapses over time into a yellowed paper crust. Slick spindly legs also provide depth for the ruby red body. The nose contains strong vanilla, malt balls, wood ready for the final clear coat, and a definite base of ethanol. It is strong but not of character for a 10% ABV release.

Flavor / Palate - Creamy from start to finish the mouthfeel is thick. The bitter base holds up vanilla, oak, and rosy floral aspects. Warm with an alcoholic aftertaste this feels like the amped up Scotch ale it is. Unless you have a reason not to take your time and savor a well rounded beer from one of Americas best breweries.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Appearance a dirty ruby / brown with a very thin white head that rims around the glass.

656,"2011-11-07",3.4,"This beer served chilled in a shaker pint.

Ar- The beer smells really good; however it falls just shy of fantastic. Nice earthy peat notes compete with vanilla oak bourbon, sweet smoked caramel nicely toasted and roasted malt. 

Ap- The body of the beer is mahogany. The head of the beer is shortly lived resolving to a ring of foam.

T- The beer is sweet caramel, toasted and roasted malts a flash of smoke and peat. The alcohol is a bit spicey. This beer is really nice but again just short of fantastic. 

P- The body is a little thinner than I want. The carbonation levels help this beer to be smooth and slick. Alchol is a bit player. Oddly enough I think this could be ramped up a bit more. I think  a bit more bourbonesque feel would be nice.

656,"2011-10-26",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2013 Reviewed on November 25, 2012, new review reflects score
Bottled October 8, 2012.
Appearance: The body is a clear mahogany with no head at all.
Aroma: This is very complex with oak, vanilla, dark cherries, and bourbon. I love the aroma here.
Taste: This is balanced absolutely beautifully with like smoke, oak, bourbon, dark cherries, light bourbon, and some earthy notes and peat on the finish. This is great and wonderfully complex.
Palate: Thick and syrupy with light carbonation.
Overall: This is not only an excellent beer, but it is priced very well. I dont think that theres a better value in bourbon barrel aged beers, if there is Id like to see it! This is wonderfully complex with a lot to pick apart.

Cellar Review: Bottled October 5, 2013 (10 months old).
Appearance: The body is a beautiful garnet with great clarity. The head is short and doesnt last very long. The tan coating is sparse with a thin ring.
Aroma: The aroma is huge vanilla with oak, and a touch of bourbon backing on the initial sip. Upon swirling smoke and cherries are noticed with sweet malts that remind me of toffee.
Taste: The intro is strong of black cherry, fig and hints of smoke. Vanilla and watery bourbon are noticeable from the mid-taste to the finish. The finish lingers a bit of oak and is a touch dry. This drinks like complex, but watery bourbon.
Palate: Thick with light carbonation.
Overall: Time hasnt done anything good to this. I wont age this again, it drinks about perfectly fresh.

656,"2011-04-09",4.3,"Got this in a trade with Baltimorebeerguy. Ive been wanting to try it for a while, as I work my way through the wee heavys. Hard to find around here.

Aggressive pour into a pint glass. 2 finger head that drips down beautfiully with complex, syrupy lacing.

Stays firm after a few minutes. Pits and valleys. Dark copper, auburn, mahogany color. Slightly cloudy. Aroma weighs heavily on the bourbon side. Nothing Scotchy here. Getting vanilla and burnt sugar.

Let warm for 5 minutes.

Hit with the bourbon boozines right off the bat. Sticky, toffee, vanilla, malty, chewy creamy,

Nothing wrong with that, I like many bourbon beers. But it seems that when you age things in b. barrels, it either marries up to the style of brew, or it doesnt. When it does, youve got amazing things like Goose Island Rare stout. When it doesnt, you get things like Kentucky Bourbon Ale that just taste like you poured bourbon in with the original beer.

This one is somewhere in between. Yeah, Im getting the malty, dark ale feel but it doesnt really say Scotch Ale to me a whole lot.

It IS delicious though and my only complaint is a slightly dry, phenolic finish. Im not grabbing this when I want a Scotch Ale, but its a wonderful sipper when you want that Bourbon feel but dont want the heaviness of a stout.","Pennsylvania, USA","radioscooter"
656,"2011-03-30",4.0,"12oz bottle poured into my Darkness glass...A ruby copper, murky ugly. Little carbonation, only about half a finger rises later, falls quick, and only has a very thin film.

Vanilla really shows off as it warms...The taste is really mostly smooth bourbon with lots of vanilla, oak shows off as well. This is really good, however on the finish there is a scotch note that I dont like. Starts to kill the drinkability.

I really enjoy this except for a split second on the finish. A non heavy handed barrel aged that displays mostly the bourbon but very enjoyable and drinkable.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

Boozy, this one may take several sips, but as it warms the character of this brew shines through.  Great beer to end the night with.","","Johnsense"
656,"2011-03-17",4.3,"A - Pours a fairly clear deep red-brown color (mahogany) with a finger of off-white head. The head faded fairly quickly to a nice ring on the glass and laced very nicely.

S - Very powerful and deep smokey (bourbon) aroma. Also some sweet elements from vanilla and carmel notes. There is also booze in the nose. Excellent aroma.

T - Starts off with some sweet carmel malts and a touch of the smokiness building in the background. Also the vanilla is also mixed in. In the middle the smoky flavor really jumps out. The finish has some more of the smokey/bourbon taste, the sweet malts, some dark fruit flavors, and some booze flavor, which all blend together and linger for a while. Excellent balance in the flavor.

M - Medium to medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Almost a bit think and creamy without being too viscous. The smokiness really coasts the mouth well. There is some nice alcohol sting on the tongue also.

D - Fairly drinkable. Knocking in at a relatively high 10.20 % abv, this is a fairly heavy beer and is best sipped. That being said, the booze flavors stay in check for high level and the flavor is just amazingly well balanced and complex. Excellent beer.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"
656,"2011-03-16",4.3,"Pours a brownish, dark maroon color.  An off white, very light tan head that was relatively small and it didnt have much retention.  Might be because of the high ABV of this beer.  Left some traces of lacing.  The beer is predominately cloudy with some burnt orange highlights at the bottom.  The aroma clearly had the characteristics of bourbon whiskey.  A nice ""woody"" note also.  This brew had a very pleasant burnt sugar, toffee, caramel malt smell.  Maybe even a small touch of chocolate.  It smells a little like those candy brown sugar ""haystacks.""  Sorghum even.  Very complex and balanced.  The flavor revealed the bourbon whiskey once again, but it also had a brown sugar taste that gave it some sweetness.  I swear it seems like Im getting a slight touch of an orange slice taste.  Small smattering of bitterness.  Again, well balanced and complex.  Medium/full mouthfeel with a significant alcohol burn and warmth.  Leaves a tremendous amount on the palate.  Well after the sip the flavor remains.  Its smoother than one might think and it is nicely dry all the way through.  This beer is very, very nice.  Lots of kick and a wonderful aroma and taste and mouthfeel.  Most definitely a beer for sipping.  The alcohol is prevelant, but it is surprisingly not distracting.  Its noticeable in the mouthfeel, but its not unbearable.  After one of these I would more than likely be done.  Not from lack of enjoyment, but lack of alcohol tolerance.","Kentucky, USA","Shrews629"
656,"2011-03-14",4.5,"12 oz brown stubby bottle. 2010 vintage.

It pours an extremely deep and dark plum color. Just sitting there it looks black. The head is thick and tightly foamed and has a bit of creaminess. It is off-white and sticks for a nice while before receding with some nice lacing.

The bourbon and oak dominate the smell, though you can smell traces of the scotch ale underneath. It has a subtle fruitiness that provides a bit of freshness to the tried and true bourbon oak scent.

The flavor is very smooth and nice. It has a rich flavor of buttery toffee that meshes very nicely with the bourbon. There are notes of vanilla and milk chocolate caramel as well. The 50 IBUs are nice and keep this one pretty balanced. The bitterness is slightly tannic with a good deal of woodiness, hops, and a slight roasty bitterness. the fruitiness isnt as pronounced in the taste, but there is a nice bit of prune underneath it all that adds an extra layer of depth.

The mouthfeel is rich and full-bodied with an exquisite carbonation. It has an alcohoic punch but it isnt overt.

After having Dirty Bastard I didnt think this one would be this good, but this is exquisite.

656,"2010-05-09",4.5,"He appeared in my glass dressed in rich murky browns, much like old musty wood that has seen many years of luscious bourbon aging in her round depths. A small head immediately fades into a khaki ringlet while a splotchy film tries and fails to cover her surface. A few swirls produce a decent showing of lace, but even better, a huge belch of bourbony proportions.


Mm bourbon. A moment please Thank you. Ok, and now we return to our regularly scheduled program.


Wood and spice, cinnamon and nutmeg specifically, are followed by candy apples, plums, raisins, and even more bourbon. Did I mention there is lots of bourbon in this beer? A flourish of vanilla extract and root leads into a warm tickle at the back of my nose right before I wrap thirsty lips around her liquid bounty. My first impression is of how well balanced his palate is. Bourbon sweetness and warmth is immediately evident, but not overpowering. Vanilla, cinnamon, and dry wood mingle atop giddy tastebuds, lingering long after each quaff. As he warms, the dryness spreads warm tendrils throughout my body, and each quaff is a soothing repeat of the last. Not as complex as some bourbon barrel aged ales, the apples, prunes, and raisins flitter in and out, weaving a dark fruit delight with apply sass throughout his palate. Exquisite, and even better, sessionable. Ill take another one, please.


Founders, how I love thee, why arent you in Florida? Just remembering this beer is making me thirsty. Just as with all Founders beers, should you stumble across this particular option, take home a sixer, or 12pack. Why err on the side of less when you could take home more.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Flavor is strong with alcohol, but it remains smooth and very drinkable (minimal burn). Flavor is pretty sweet; vanilla, caramel, wood, bourbon.","Washington DC, USA","brigg"
656,"2010-04-26",4.4,"A- Body appears to be a dark brown color. Pours with a minimal <1/2 finger head that immediately fades to a very thin collar and no lacing is left behind in the glass. When held up to the light one can see that this is actually.

S- Sweet bourbon with an alcohol burn on the nostrils balances well with the dark malt profile offered by this Scottish ale. Sweet, like molasses and a chocolate presence added with bourbon sweetness and burn. Nice..

T-Upfront is a bit of roasted (but not quite bitter) malt that offsets the sweet caramel and bourbon flavors going on. The finish adds a touch of dark chocolate to what is already going on along with a bourbon alcohol burn. The bitterness is very well hidden the entire way through and the character of this beer is complex, slightly sweet, and very warm.

P- Low to medium carbonation and a body made up mostly of somewhat thick, very smooth, caramel and dark malt. Goes down very easily.

O- The more I acquaint myself to them the more I am loving Scotch Ales. This is a darn good one. The bourbon is a perfect compliment to this beer and I think its great. The alcohol is definitely not hidden...but it is not obnoxious either. Wonderful and definitely my favorite Founders brew! IMO, it easily Trumps Breakfast Stout and KBS. Wasnt expecting this to be so good!

Thicker mouthfeel, moderate carbonation, slightly oily, has a hit of alcohol but not as much as youd expect with the ABV.

2010 bottle, tasted moments after hitting 55F

Pours incredibly deep ruby, practically chocolate.  Highly active carbonation but only a moderate head, tons of gorgeous actively bubbling lacing though.  The nose is almost all bourbon, and a little hot, with the familiar notes of Dirty Bastard playing in the distant background.  Super-creamy, a little oily, solid hints of bitter in the back of the palate to counter-balance a lot of sweet bourbon and malt on the front.  Whisky burn is quite present on the finish.

Aroma is bursting with woody bourbon and vanilla. Once this starts warming up, medium sweet caramels and toffees come in. Some dark fruits as well. Flavor is similar and solid. Lots of vanilla and bourbon, but lots of balancing malts. Caramels and toffees, some fruit, and a light spicing before this finishes with a touch of chocolate and dries with a woody, earthy finish. The hops are somewhat muted by everything else going on, but they offer a light bitterness. Rich malts and plenty of vanilla-bourbon in a long aftertaste. Body is full and smooth with just a touch of soft carbonation. Overall, this was nice. Lots of bourbon and caramel with the vanilla adding a really pleasant sweetness. The woodiness doesnt dry this too much and leaves the body full and smooth. This is clearly dominated by the barrel aging, but it has other things going on that make it quite enjoyable. Good stuff.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Its just really strong in the vanilla and oak. The palate is good, works well. Lots of additional oak and vanilla with a pleasing biscuity finish.

Following these into the flavor was some moderate hop bitterness and hints of dark and dry bakers chocolate. Full bodied and a real treat on tap since many places in the area only offered bottles.

In the mouth it is less impressive, giving off too much alcohol (not particularly warming) with a relatively blah malt foundation supplemented by the bourbon & wood dimensions.  It strikes me that this is a fairly ""pure"" exercise in taking a plain beer and giving it a dose of bourbon barrels, which isnt bad at all, but it is fairly plain or unidimensional.  Ten years ago this would have been a revolution; now it is just a beer some people might like, and others might find it a big crass.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

Mouthfeel is full and carbonation is smooth finishing with some smoke and oak which is very dry.  Really good stuff.

Cloudy dark reddish-brown with minimal head and spotty lacing. However, the thin head actually lasts; not often the case with high abv beers.

The taste is very similar to the smell but sweeter, with strong notes of vanilla, oak, cherry, peat, as well as toffee and dark fruit.

Low carbonation and quite warming. While certainly not light in body, it is lighter than expected.

656,"2009-08-22",4.2,"Picked up in a trade with the Beer Sommelier. 12 oz. 2008 bottle. Nice dark brown with a nice thin off-white head. Best scotch ale I have seen to date! Aromatic bourbon and wood aroma; nice aroma! A nice sublte sweet, dare I say almost chocolate sweet, aroma. Smells like an fin smore! Very nice aroma I must say! Not overly pungent, but just so damn smooth of a nose. Nice vanilla-sweet flavor. Has a nice bourbon finish. PilsnerPeter below my rating said this had a graham cracker aroma, well I am tasting that in the flavor. This would be perfect with dessert, even though I dont care for matching beer with foods, I would rather just drink the damn beer! Nice sweet caramel flavor as well. This beer is very good, and very nuanced in terms of flavor and aroma. Not a VERY creamy beer, but this thing is pretty smooth. Alcohol is welll hideen, although there is a slight bite at the end. I am happy I traded for this, seeing that this beer is just a superiour scotch ale. Nice bourbon touches throughout the drinking experience, which I love.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

656,"2009-08-05",4.0,"Draught. I was told this was a barrel aged version but I surmise from the description that thats the norm. The body was dark brown almost ash colored with a decent tan head that produced nice lacing. Aroma was initially mellifluous, some vanilla, strong bourbon oak, caramel, a little dark chocolate or coffee roast, and a sweet spicy perhaps even slightly peaty finish alongside alcohol. The flavor was even better; chocolate syrup, caramel, bourbon oak, light vanilla, lightly rooty and spicy, and the wood and alcohol finished out strong. Palate was thick and smooth and slightly numbing.","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","Jsawyer"
656,"2009-07-31",4.1,"08 sample thanks to Ben @ crown #6. Pours dark golden, scotch-like. Nose is slight roasted malt, bourbon, some vanilla. Taste is an excellent complexion, very good bourbon component that doesnt overpower, slightly sweet, smooth and a little caramel/nut. Finish is a bit sticky, and aftertaste is wonderful bourbon with a touch of alcohol, not too much in any way. Wonderful beer, glad I got to try!","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","awiseman01"
656,"2009-07-25",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2013 11/15/2007:  Founders Backwoods Bastard has sweet caramel and chocolate in the arom with faint bourbon and quite a bit of vanilla in the aroma.  The beer has a clear, dark brown color topped with a thin layer of dissipating foam.  The flavor has heavily caramelized malt and chocolate, dry woody notes, bourbon, and plnty of vanilla.  There are traces of chocolate in the finish and the alcohol is reserved.  This beer is full-bodied, yet smooth and lightly creamy on the palate.  It does look quite thick though!  Overall this is a fantastic scotch ale and much better than the regular Dirty Bastard Scotch Ale.

2007 Vintage
6/10/2010:  Founders Backwoods Bastard (Ale aged in oak bourbon barrels)...  Aroma:  Amazing blend of vanilla, boubon, sherry, syrupy malt, hint of barrel char.  Appearance:  Good pop when opening; orange/golden brown color; clean; beige crown that quickly gathers on the pour and the fades away to the edges...  Flavor:  Delicious, intense, smooth, rich, sugary caramel maltiness; vanilla; charred oak; dry bourbon with just a bit of bite and bitterness in the finish.  Palate:  Medium-bodied; quite smooth; slightly mellow mouthfeel with just the right tingle of carbonation.  Overall:  Still damn good; more dry (compared to when its fresh and young) with lots of bourbon coming through.

Flavour matches up well, same as above, with a really good full-mouthfeel, and a touch of maple which wasnt present in the aroma. Absolutely delicious.

The aroma consists of a lot of caramel malt, a lot of bourbon and alcohol, and some light smoke in the background. As the beer warmed, I could smell some dried fruit also. My first sip of this beer had a huge alcohol warming. It also consisted of caramel and roasted malts, light bourbon, and some dark dried fruit.

656,"2009-04-27",3.9,"12 oz bottle courtesy of TheEpeeist. Wonderful. Pours a thicker brownish rusty amber, with small tannish head that laces some and sticks around. Aromas are similar to the original, pushing caramel and vanilla over light roast, toffee and biscuits, with light peat and moving to some nice oak that accentuates these flavors well, pushing more oak and vanilla and bourbon. Exciting. Initial is full bodied, picking up more oak and bourbon up front, trailing into vanilla and caramel with toffee and biscuits, light peat and smoke. A bit of warmth, but pretty smooth overall. A bit of bitterness on the backend balances, and oak and vanilla with caramel and bourbon seem to leave an impressive aftertaste with that touch of warmth. Good body, strong. Cheers!","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Great aroma - lots of bourbon, tons of alcohol, but smokey woody sweet scotch ale lingers underneath as well.  First sip is almost overwhelming - huge alcohol and huge bourbon.  But the Scotch Ale shines through again - this is why you need a big solid beer when you do this bourbon stuff - great smokey and woody notes, huge alcohol and by the end the huge bourbon is balanced really well.

Smells mostly of boozy bourbon wood, without much else going on in the nose.
Flavor tends towards being a bit one-dimensional, but not bad.  Flavor is dominated by the wood and bourbon notes.  Booze is contained, but the woody notes run wild in the flavor.  Beneath that, some notes of tart apples and belgian quad-ish dark fruits.

656,"2009-02-16",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2009 Beautiful appearance, dark mahogany reddish color; this wispy head. Bourbonish nose, wood. Bourbonish flavor, rubber, barrel, medium sweetness, actually reminds me of some sherried single malt scotches. A lot of body without feeling too thick, slight alcohol warmth, perfectly carbonated. Just rough enough around the edges to keep me interested. Actually its this semi-bitter earthy core that holds this beer together. Not terribly complex but tasty, well made, and interesting. Its official, Founders is my favorite American brewery. I wish I was a better writer / beer drinker so that I could do this beer justice. I say that to myself after every great beer that I cant describe. Damn, this really hit the spot. I would totally drink another one if I didnt know this is (likely) my only 4 pack for the rest of the year and that its $4 a bottle.

Edit: Okay I ended up drinking a second bottle. This is such an easy drinker I could have gone for a third, but that would be my last bottle for the year, so Im saving it for another time. A few hours later, no headache, no stomachache, this beer just made me doze off to sleep for an evening nap and I woke up feeling great. What a great beer. I cant wait to get some more next year.","Medford, Massachusetts, USA","minch25"

The beer is a dark plum / dark amber color that shows a lightly hazy, cranberry red hue when held up to the light. At the first, the aroma is a nice mix between rich malt notes and oak aromatics.  However the flavour is slightly more complex than the aroma, with a dry astringency in addition to the sweet vanilla Bourbon. Sweet butterscotch, oak, and bakers chocolate as well. Slightly thin feel, with some harsh boozy fire midway through.  This is not a bad brew, but the bourbon character is a bit much, especially as the beer warms up a bit.

A light sweet peaty note that just kisses the deeper caramel and heavily toasted malts.  Very rich and malty smokiness with an intense nuttiness.  Loads of what seems like kettle caramelization.  Rich and sweet flavour but there is also loads of peppery ethanolic heat on the back of the palate.  Its plenty tasty in small doses, but even 10 oz seems like a little bit too much for one serving.  Intensely sweet.

Notes of dark fruit, caramel, rye, wood, hops,mild bourbon. Flavor lays down a thick layer of alcohol and caramel, also tasted, some toffee, vanilla, brown sugar, and some more alcohol.  Because of extra alcohol here, I would expect this to be more cloying and sweet but it is not.  A dry, peaty finish which I can respect.  Most scotch ales finish way too sweet for me.

This years bottle list the alcohol at 10.2%, I think 9.2% would be better, a bit too much of alcohol that seems to take away from the enjoyment of the drink, I think less bourbon alcohol flavor would help me enjoy the Scotch part of this drink, I found a variance in the alcohol aroma and flavor between the four bottles in the single four pack I bought, I liked the bottle with the least bit of bourbon influence, if you like bourbon infused alcohol Scotch Ale then you will like this, a bit too much bourbon alcohol aroma and flavor for me to really enjoy the drink.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"

Like the aroma, the beer is whiskey dominated throughout but the chocolate grows along with the temperature.  Feel is creamy but just a bit thin.  It also provides some zing on the tongue and whiskey can be felt, especially in the back of the tongue.  Whiskey lovers will enjoy this beer because that is what dominates both aroma and flavor.

The taste follows the aroma fairly closely with the exception of a very slight hop presence up front before giving way to the massive bourbon and caramel malt backbone. There is plenty of vanilla as well and the oak really comes out in the finish and lingers for a while between sips.

The aroma was all bourbon, vanilla, very faint oak. Did I mention the bourbon? Roasty and smoke notes fill in slightly on the flavor, but this was pretty hot and full of bourbon (even some maple) to the point that it wasn’t pleasant combined with an astringency that was unwelcomed.

Bright, but not hot or overly alcoholic. A bit of soap and oak. Thats nice. Pours an evenly toned ruddy brown, 40% opaque. Silky, long lace of pale khaki film. Flavor is a dense, sweetened cream mingled with bourbon straight from the glass. Carbonation parses out some caramels, oak tannins, and maple-like residuals. Surprisingly light and not densely sweet, but the alcohol from the bourbon really dominates the profile. Not unlike that more abominable Imperial Stout. Theres a nice leafy hop backdrop to the beer that settles the alcohols. Malt complexity is average and I would have expected more caramel density, but I appreciate that lack of cloying sweetness. And interesting bourbon rendition. I think this would be more interesting blended back with the straight Bastard, around 40%. Refined and mature.

More please!","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","Soonah"
656,"2008-02-15",3.2,"A slightly vigorous pour produces only enough head to cover the beer for a half second, what is there is a amber tinged tan color.  The beer is a dark plum / dark amber color that shows a lightly hazy, cranberry red hue when held up to the light.  At the first, the aroma is a nice mix between rich malt notes and oak aromatics.  Deeper inspection yields much the same with competing aromas of ripe, bright, concentrated berry notes, some spicy bourbon, soft butterscotch, a touch of molasses, deeply caramelized malt, lightly toasted grain and browned biscuits.

Somewhat sweet, though this beer drinks much richer than the sweetness would suggest.  The body of this beer is downright chewy, viscous and mouth-coating.  Flavors of berries, hugely caramelized grain and a rich malt character slowly yield to spicy, oak and Bourbon influenced flavors that linger on in the finish.  The buttery notes from the oak and Bourbon character really shows through in the finish and it adds a nice compliment to the up front malt focus of this beer.  Peppery oak and a bit of hot boozy Bourbon notes provides a sharpness, almost harshness as the beer warms up a bit.

I really like that the malt character plays a slightly bigger role in the flavor profile than the bourbon barrel does; this keeps the integrity of the rich, Scotch ale style, but with an offsetting bourbon component that helps to offset / balance the thick malt character of this brew.  Having said that, bourbon barrel aged beers seem to be a bit hard for me to get behind; there is something about the Bourbon notes that add a harshness the beers aged in the barrels that just doesnt quite work for me.  As the beer warms up from its initial 50°F / 10°C it picks up more of the sharp, hot, Bourbon flavors which pull this away from being balanced.  This is not a bad brew, but the Bourbon character is a bit much, especially as the beer warms up a bit.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

656,"2008-01-19",3.7,"Bottles thanks to a couple fine folks!  Poured deep, plummy caramel.. a little on the thicker side, with a nice, but short-lived cap of yellowy-beige head.  The aroma was quite delightful, with hefty doses of barrel influence, but somewhat repressed Scotch Ale.. vanilla and sweet bourbon sugars first and foremost with warm drawn caramel and dark fruits accented by smoke behind.. really enjoyed it!  The flavor had the same caramel and vanilla from the barrel on the sweet core, with rougher oak graininess and sweet bourbon all around the edges.. very sweet overall with good, but not great balance.. sharper bourbon and more vanilla leave quite an impression on the finish.  Medium-bodied or a little thicker on the palate with moderate carbonation.. a little too much barrel influence, and a touch too sharp for my liking on the back.  Overall a very good beer.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

656,"2008-01-04",3.6,"Bottle from Santa.  Poured a deep dark copper color with a short-lived head.  The aroma is bourbon-dominated, with some background malty character and vanilla as well.  The taste is mostly bourbon again atop the heavy maltiness one expects from a Scotch Ale.  A good deal of a nice oakiness in the finish along with some heat.  Melikes the Scotch ale for its simple and earthy display of subtle tastes like malt and peat, and here, these qualities are overpowered by bourbon.  The bourbon flavors mask the Scotch character and therefore the whole point.","Florida, USA","JMFG"

The aroma is malty, as a Scotch should be, with a big bourbon overtone, woodsy vanilla, cola and root beer scents.  Im not picking up any of the peat that I expected, but thats no big deal, really.  Wood flavors play a big role here, as the oak bourbon barrels have certainly made their contribution to this brew.  Vanilla plays a big role, as do the massive dark caramel malts.

Full-bodied with a slick, oily mouthfeel and lively carbonation. Moderate malt sweetness is well-balanced by sufficient alcohol and hop bitterness.

Backwoods Bastard pours a fairly clear burnt caramel that glows ruby when backlit. There are some tiny suspended particles of protein. A one-plus ecru head rose as I poured and eventually faded to a creamy crown leaving some big sticky patches as I drink.

Sweet caramel and toffee come through nicely in the aroma. Smooth notes of vanilla and oak glide through flawlessly. While there is a touch of smokey bourbon its in the background and only works to compliment the other aromas. This stuff smells exceptional!

Flavor walks right along with the aroma. All the flavors meld seamlessly to create an excellent Wee heavy. Caramel and toffee are the base of this beer but the real highlight is the vanilla and oak from the barrel aging. There is a hint of alcohol in the flavor that wasnt there in the aroma. This knocks down the score a notch.

The body is on the heavier side of medium although feels thick and creamy on the tongue. Velvety smooth as it glides along. Id venture to guess the barrel aging makes the body as velvety as it is.

This beer is very easy to sip. Its cold outside, theres football on tv and this is the beer Id most like to be drinking right now. Hits the spot.

I dont think this needs to be said but this is another great beer from Founders. Theyve really opened things up this year with all the new bottled releases. A great beer from one of the best breweries in the country.

Fruit flavors in dark cherry pit and currant syrup; nothing too cloying or too crisp.  Pleasantly smooth, erudite, and stunningly composed thickness of palate; while all its dark sweetness could render it either abrasively sugary or slick with alcoholic spirit imitation, it does neither.

I would like a little more of this flavor to offset the burbon a little more but I would still have to say this is the best oak burbon beer Ive ever had.  Good job Founders.  Thanks to Vinnys beer store who gave me this 12oz beauty on the house, check him out in Cleveland.  Pretty solid selection.","Port Clinton, Ohio, USA","grandridge"

Pencil shavings and rubber erasures reach the nose shaft first, followed more enthusiastically by bourbon, talc and a chocolate toffee powder composite. Flavor livens up to the bourbon delivery and leaves a fair share to the imagination. Rye and toffee get infused with graham crackers to produce a scotchy substance.

Poured a dark, deep blackish brown with a nice foamy, creamy head, just a tasty looking appearance.

Aromas of roasted grains, chocolate, caramel, smoky peat, the alcohol meshes with the bourbon barrel vanilla, and dark fruity esters.

Good, smooth moderate carbonation and a malty crisp, dryish, slick, velvety full bodied mouthfeel.

Delicious roasted malt taste, chocolate, butterscotch toffee, a nice soft smoky peat, raisin fruitiness, vanilla and molasses, towards the end the bourbon barrel flavors combines with the alcohol to provide a smooth warmth in the back of the palate, and a dry roasted malty finish.

An exceptional smooth sipper, the taste coats the mouth and makes you want more and more, one of the best brews Ive tasted from Founders, a must try.","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"
656,"2007-03-13",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2008 Draft at 2007 MBG winter fest.  Deep dark brown color, with small diminishing head.  Flavor is bourbon, some dark fruits, caramel and malt, peat, picks up hints of vanilla from the barrel.  big and tasty.  Would like to try this one again.   Ive heard rumors that they might bottle this, would definitely like to see how it ages.

Re rate.  Tried this out of the bottle and it was incredibly woody.  Not nearly as good.  first time: 4.4
Last time 3.9","Holt, Michigan, USA","masonjer"

656,"2007-03-02",3.9,"Draft at 2007 Michigan BGWF. Poured dark brown color with a moderate light brown head that diminished slowly with good lacing.  Good caramel toasted malt aroma. Medium  to full body with a smooth texture. Good well balanced bourbon and tart fruit malty flavor with a moderate smooth balanced finish of moderate duration. Good brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"

Flavor is peat, bourbon, sweet malt, hint of oak, vanilla, toffee, dried fruit.   Palate is medium bodied, mildly carbonated, sweet silky smooth finish.

656,"2007-02-23",4.2,"On Tap at a special tapping at Landmark In Milwuakee.Aroma was somewhat subtle,dark Scottish carmels and just a touch of the whiskey, wow,nothing subtle about the taste,big bold smooth sweet bourbon,mixed with carmel,toffee, and hints of dark fruit, the silky palate is wonderful. As good as any barrel aged Ive had","Muskego, Wisconsin, USA","brewblackhole"
656,"2007-02-18",3.8,"On tap at the brewery. Deep ruddy orange-brown body, medium tan head. Potent aroma with sweet caramels, dark fruit, oak, and hot alcohol. Dense, heavy body with strong barrel flavors, but not overwhelming the malt slurry. Reminded me of a caramel apple in a way, or an apple cider on steroids. Heavy toasts and caramel, touches of smoke too. Sharp alcohol notes, too. We have a winner.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
656,"2007-02-12",3.6,"EBF 2007: Hazy deep amber in color not much head. Aroma, dark fruits, some molasses, a bit peaty, not much of the barrel on the aroma. Flavor, sweet, with some heat on it, oak, some caramel, and a fruitiness to it. It wasnt bad, but I dont think it holds a candle to that other barrel aged brew that they have.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
656,"2007-02-11",3.7,"EBF 2007 - another bourbon-aged beer from Founders?  sure, why not - and this one actually turned out pretty well - unlike many bourbon-aged beers, this one isnt as sweet and boozy (unlike the previous rating - maybe I am wrong, but this was only the third beer I had that night) - the barrel adds a nice compliment to the smokey flavors already present in the beer, combining with the bourbon and malt to make the beer taste similar to very peaty scotch at times - some plum and other dark fruit at the back end - very well-executed.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
656,"2007-02-07",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 20, 2007 this is a oak-aged version of their Dirty Bastard...on tap at the brewery...deep chesnut body with minimal head...nice oaky/bourbon aroma, large in caramels and spicy hops...flavor is very similar to the aroma, and is a tad too boozy (heavy in the bourbon, heavy in the sugars)...could use a little less aging or a little less bourbon additive (whatever is the case)...outside of that, this was very good; another good one from Founders","Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA","badnewsbeers"
