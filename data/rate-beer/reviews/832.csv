832,"2017-01-22",3.4,"Can. Cloudy straw colour with frothy white head that quickly dissipates. Tropical fruit bomb aroma, with a touch of grass and background malt. The flavour profile belies the aroma, with a spicy, dry and bitter front palate. There's a touch of passionfruit towards the finish and a small amount of malt adds some balance. The champagne yeast is indiscernible and the spicy, bitter hops overpower. The heavy ABV rears its head towards the end of the glass. Over carbonated.

Hoppiness: Strong passion fruits, raw grapes, yellow fruits, notes of grapefruits, floral, and lemon in nose. Light passion fruits, molasses, strong lemon and sharp grass I taste; Bitterness is intense but pleasant for a lasting, high astringent bitter-sweet finish.

832,"2015-08-26",3.5,"Bottle shared by esp0r november 29th 2014. Golden body with a thick white head. Aroma is sweet orange jam with a slight alcohol burn, taste is floral with earthy hops, pineapple and herbs. Grassy aftertaste with a high bitterness.","NORWAY","daje"
832,"2015-08-09",3.8,"Color: Straw yellow with lasting white foam.
Aroma: Pungent and moderately funky passion fruit, white grapefruit and yeast.
Palate: Very fine soft, carbonated attack
Flavor: Fine bubbly, passion fruit and grain. Finishes with a pungent passion fruit and white grapefruit rind that gains intensity as does a lingering grass and pine bitterness that overtakes the grapefruit bitterness.

832,"2015-07-06",3.8,"From Bottle Shop, drank after HKUST visit. Beautiful bright hazy golden pour with big fluffy white head and foamy legs. Smells of Nelson Sauvin hop - plenty of grape as well as mango and peach, woody. Biscuity lightly spiced malt too. Taste is wood chip floral hop, dry grape and mineral. Body is smooth, very fine carbonation (from the champagne yeast). Very interesting, fine and refreshing. Slick, fruity (grape + citrus), woody, fizzy.","HONG KONG","CacheManyHose"
832,"2015-07-06",3.8,"Bottle from Bottle Shop at home. Bright golden slightly hazy translucent pour with foamy white head. Vertical strips of bubbles like champagne. Looks great. Aroma is fresh crisp pilsner hoppiness. Taste is really clean - fresh hoppiness, smooth slightly sweet malts, crisp champagne carbonation. Lingering pilsner bitterness. The best version of what I'd imagined/hoped after reading the description. Would definitely get again.","HONG KONG","HKdIPA"
832,"2015-07-03",3.5,"Bottle. Pours hazy yellow with a white head. Aroma of floral notes, white wine, fruitiness and yeast. Flavor is sweet and fruity with some white wine, malt and tropical fruits. Medium body, average carbonation.","Kristiansand, NORWAY","Geokkjer"

832,"2015-01-30",3.8,"Pours a mostly clear light gold with pillowy white head. Big hop aroma, while very pleasant, overshadows the pils malts. Catty hops, rather than tropical fruits as on the label. Crisp, bitter hop flavor. Ahh, here are the tropical fruits: mango. Along with some grapefruit zest and pith. Dry finish with a lingering bitterness. This could get me to the ballet.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","GlassBrass440"
832,"2015-01-04",2.8,"Bottle. Pours a slightly hazy yellow body with a medium creamy white head. Nose is grass, kiwi, grapefruit, straw, citric peel and hints of catty herbs, pale malts and tomato plant. Taste is dry citric peel tones, champagne yeast, pale malts, catty herbs, mild red fruits and hints of resin and straw. Medium body, crisp and dry finish. A bit too much on the bitter side for me; the citric-pale malts-champagne yeast combination doesnt really work on my palate and the Nelson hop additions does nothing to relieve the feeling. I can see where this beer wants to go, but I dont want to follow.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

832,"2014-12-27",3.4,"It is what it is really. Yellow gold in colour with a tinge of haze and a coarse white head. A nose full of lime and yellow grapefruit peel with just a hint of sour juiciness reflected in the flavour. Its a tasty, elegant thing with some real steel to its flavour. Some real tartness there, like the tears of a failed ballerina.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"

832,"2014-08-15",3.4,"Aroma of grapefruit and ice wine grapes, lime rind, with a squirt of skunk. Flavour is hoppy bitter, a bit grassy, but still balanced with the same fruits as on the aroma (except the mustelid). Very creamy palate, nice for this lager. Nothing too exciting about the appearance, lemony gold with a creamy white head. Really much better than the average lager. I could drink more of this.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"
832,"2014-07-31",3.4,"Went into this without reading description. Obvious skanky nelson Sauvin on the nose. Pale light base malt colouring. Pillowy foamy white head. Flavour is similar to nose enjoyable, boozy. Small amount of bitterness. Almost Saison like but without the spice. A beautiful well crafted beer, but I could really only drink the one and saviour that flavour.","Palmerston North, NEW ZEALAND","BungEye"
832,"2014-05-30",3.8,"Clear highly carbonated poor with fizzy white head. Pungent hops from start to Finnish. Tropical passion fruit - great kiwi hop flavour. Nice difference the highly hoped lager from the ale was that it seemed light not overly filling then again might have just been because it was the first beer of the day.","NEW ZEALAND","Rangi"
832,"2014-05-15",3.5,"Pours a golden straw color with foamy off white head. Nose is approachable. Floral, some passionfruit, slightly spicy phenolic aroma, a tiny bit of orange marmalade. Flavor is pretty similar. Passionfruit, a little spice, slightly sweet marmalade note, lightl bitter finish. Very focussed, with a light body, fine carbonation and moderately long finish. The yeast character in this is really the star. The phenols and the slightly marmaladey sweet note taste very Belgian and they make this much more than a premium lager. Interesting for sure.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Niksko"

832,"2014-01-06",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 18, 2016 Restrained tropical fruit aroma in a golden pour. An excellent lager that would make an ale drinker happy. Clean taste somehow remains complex (and that is not the brew talking). Probably better than my initial rating indicates - will endeavour to try again and update as required.","Wellington, NEW ZEALAND","beer-yum"
832,"2013-12-28",3.6,"An unfiltered, sparkling, strong golden lager which has undergone secondary fermentation with Champagne yeast. From the bright tank it was highly gassy with a billowy white head. Champagne yeast is immediately evident with a strong calcium minerality and bright phenol profile, its airy, dusty, earthy but clean with developing floral perfume character. Wonderfully clean with high carbonation, soft malt texture, medium sweetness, medium bitterness with a rich, filling mouth feel.  Nelson hops giving it that obligatory Sauvignon Blanc fruitiness with softer touches of dried grass and herbs. Well-made and interesting but novel; likable in small amounts.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
832,"2013-10-27",4.2,"Nice colour and aroma, head retention is decent. Flavour has hints of tropical fruit, particularly pineapple. Palate is quite dry but has a lovely fizz. Overall a very nice drop.","","majormax"
832,"2013-10-19",3.8,"Delicious. From the aroma you know exactly what youre getting. Floral, spicy, lemon, grapefruit, grass, hay. Hop-forward with a nice clean bitterness, this delicious fact does tend to emphasize the light(-ish) lager body. A little under-carbonated, maybe. Maybe.

Great noble hops edge and a steely-ness that cuts right through. I might actually be enjoying this lager!","Perth, AUSTRALIA","Hop_Hedonist"
832,"2013-04-27",3.5,"I like this more than I thought I would,. There is a goodly hoppiness that does not carry a rough finish. Its light and carries its flavours well.  Im enjoying so much more than I thought I would. Compared to other commercial lagers this is a head and shoulders above that.  As it warms though the hops take control and it moves away from being a premium lager, to a strong hopped beer. A bit good, but not a bit great","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","Pdubyah"
832,"2013-04-25",3.4,"UPDATED: OCT 11, 2015 Delicate like a ballet dancer this lager has a nice sweet hopped nose.  Pours a pale colour and unfortunately is lacking in depth on the palate.  The flavours are there but it just feels a little thin and watery. Overall 3.1

RERATE: Heard reports this beer has been on the improve and looks like they were right. Flavours are more persistent and not as sweet as before","NEW ZEALAND","omega"
