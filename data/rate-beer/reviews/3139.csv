The pour is a clear golden ruby color with a thin ring of egg shell colored head and no lace as it vanishes. The aroma is spectacular. The jamminess of the raspberry is killer. Its deep, fruity, light wine barrel and tartness. The fruit is just so damn huge. I love it. Its a lightly tarter Framboos 11. The flavor is great. So jammy and fruity and tart. The wine takes just a little away from this and lets the oakiness rise up. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a softer carbonation and great fruitiness out the back end. Fuck me.

Taste is damn near perfection; tons of sour raspberry fills each sip and is somewhat tamed by the oak.

Une belle bière surette à la framboise, jolie, bien balancée, et qui enfin ne porte pas cette Signature Wicked Weed sucrée qui me déplaît depuis le début de ce tasting. Bel équilibre entre le fruit, un funk léger et un crops qui lest tout autant. Beaucoup de framboises, de minuscules pépins de ce fruit des champs, une belle petite acidité dun filet de citron versé sur les fruits. Surette sans être véritablement acide. On est loin dune bière complexe, mais egalemt dune bière mal faite.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

3139,"2016-06-25",4.1,"Appearance: Arrived a deep red appearance with a scant, near white layer of froth. Very slim coating of lacing.

Smell: A scent packed with them berries, and one, thankfully, that is alive with its inherent fruitiness without leeching in any of those often and unwelcome medicinal notes.

Taste: Raspberries and a crackling, pucker-inducing tartness threaded with the vinous red wine fruitiness. Very small hint of barrel. Cleanly funky. Longly tart, juicy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Moderate carbonation.

Overall: I liked this one plenty. While, sure, it didnt display the widest range of complexities, what was there was pretty damn tasty.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
