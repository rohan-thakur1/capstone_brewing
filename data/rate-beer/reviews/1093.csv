1093,"2017-05-04",3.6,"Cask samples and halfpint @Middle Farm, April 2017. - Naturally sweet stewed pear and drier pear skin aroma made palatable by a semidry touch of wildness and a touch of sweet elderflower syrup, giving it an instant elderflower cordial taste and mouthfeel that worked a treat on this warm spring day. Blossomy elderflower working in accord with the alchohol which remains well hidden and even still a touch watery. Nice peary pun, too. - The Sweet Kentish terroir version of Cantillon Mamouche?","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

1093,"2009-02-11",3.0,"A Mes rate. Bag in a box at Chelmsford Winter Beer Festival. A pale cleanish yellow (I kid you not...) The aroma is pretty awful and in all honesty smells a bit of poo. The flavour is a dramatic improvement. Really tasty medium sweet pear with a dry fruity finish. A reasonable perry, shame about the aroma.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

1093,"2006-12-22",3.0,"From the barrel, at Reading Beer Festival, April 2006. Hazy straw colour with an apricot tinge - typical perry appearance. Straightforward and fruity. Not too much farmyard or tannins in evidence, although this is a Kentish perry so probably not made entirely from traditional perry pears.
