2845,"2016-07-07",3.1,"330ml can from Hay Deli, Hay on Way. A week out of date. Pours hazy pale yellow, big fluffy white head. Aroma is grassy lemon citrus. Taste follows. I imagine the hops used will have faded somewhat, it does taste like somethings lacking behind all that bitterness. Like Kenny says, it doesnt really taste like a pils but for it is its nice.","Shrewsbury, Shropshire, ENGLAND","minutemat"
