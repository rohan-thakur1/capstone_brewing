3903,"2016-06-22",4.3,"Bottle thanks to Bobby! Shared 6/10/16.So much De Garde! Couldnt be happier. Lovely cranberry-to-plum colored body shows a fair amount of haziness and a medium-sized, violet-flecked, off-white head that shows moderate retention.Berries, soft oak and light brett acids all rise up powerfully out of the glass. Another massive, well-done fruit nose from the seemingly masters of the game. Its neither jammy, syrupy, overbearing nor too intense (somehow its infinitely sniffable and still enjoyable, despite being so full) and theres room left (lightly) for some wheat and light wood behind it.Strong berry flavors assemble with wood tannins, soft wheat and light vanilla flavors leading to a fairly acidic finish with tons of wonderfully attenuated, dry, luscious berry notes. Its amazing how well the fruit flavor is preserved given how highly attenuated these beers are. Salinity, wood tannin and some bacterial acids all join in on the finish to deepen complexity. Tightly carbonated and with no alcohol or flaw.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3903,"2016-06-16",4.5,"Bottle. Deep purple color with a rose colored head. Big fruity Tart nose, so jammy and pulpy. Flavor is sharp, lots of fruit as well but this time it sits backseat to the tartness which is surprisingly well tamed for a dG. Pretty damn awesome beer.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
