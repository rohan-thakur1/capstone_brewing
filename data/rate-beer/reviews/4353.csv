4353,"2004-12-20",4.4,"Bottle. The colour is clear dark brown with a small tint of red. The pale beige foam is finger thick with a small crater.

The smell is explicit Jämtlands Bryggeri with lots of aroma hops. Otherwise, it is quite bitter, but there are also some roasted malts, dried apricots, oranges, and a delicate sour chemical hint. 

The carbonation is pleasant and fresh with small bubbles.

The taste is loaded with a balance of sweetness and a grand bitterness. There are some flavours of roasted malt, dried fruits (apples, apricots, raisins). The bitterness is quite complex. I noted that I couldnt even trace any alcohol, which is quite impressing at 6.5%. If I should try to summon this well crafted taste, it would be something like A straightforward and very skilful winter brew.  The long and pleasant aftertaste got lots of aroma and bitter hops, mixed with some slowly developing citric notes.

Oh yes, you have probably already guessed it: Jämtlands Bryggeri has won my testing of all available Swedish Christmas beers. No one should be surprised, really: This is the perfect way to end a hard Christmas day.","Linköping, SWEDEN","bark"
