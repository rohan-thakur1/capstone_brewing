3568,"2017-05-21",3.8,"Tap at roosevelts tulsa. Orange pour, thin white head. Aroma is tart, lightly funky, faint citrus and grain. Taste is great, nicely tart citrus, a bit of salinity, really nice! Mouth puckering, but not in. Bad way. Really a great beer. Well done.","Houston, Texas, USA","DrunkSanta410"
3568,"2016-08-28",3.9,"Bottle.

A- Subtle orange, citrus, tart, sour, salty, subtle coriander.

A- Orange color, cloudy liquid, white head.

T- Subtle orange, tart, salty, refreshing.

P- Light body, average texture, medium carbonation, slightly tart finish.

O- All in all this is a mighty fine brew. Good for breakfast too as an orange juice substitute on a warm weather day. Not a ton of orange in it but enough to make it interesting.","Ravenna, Nebraska, USA","HuskerTan"
3568,"2016-08-01",3.3,"750 mL bottle. The top of the bottle shattered upon opening, so to safely drink the bottle took some doing. Filtered through an unbleached coffee filter into a Pyrex measuring glass. As a result, there is no head. Smells of orange and wheat, but mostly orange. Tastes of orange. Orange peel and oil, like a muddled orange peel. Wheat and a little mineral flavor. Light with low carbonation, surely from the pouring process. Kinda nice, but not exceptional and it took a great deal of effort to try it.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
3568,"2016-08-01",3.8,"750 ml bottle from Craft Beer Cellar-Clayton. Shared with my visiting family while eating dinner outside on my deck. Pours a hazy dull gold with a small white head that settles into a ring and eventually nothing. The aroma starts with more orange and lemon and salty zest, but eventually becomes more muddled and wheaty and doughy, with just the faintest hint of plastic as the glass empties. The flavor is really nice and well-balanced: orange and lemon and lime citrus, salty dough, wheat, straw, and light yogurt. Medium-bodied, with low to moderate carbonation and a tart, wheaty mouthfeel. Surprising heft. Really tasty and satisfying. Ill have to stock up on more Crane next time Im home. This was a nice introduction.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3568,"2016-07-04",3.7,"Bottle; Pour is murky light / medium gold - a modest white head appears but disappears fairly quickly into this glass.The nose is citrus zest... floral notes - its subdued , really. The flavor profile is clean. Orange juice , coriander spice and salty brine - It finishes both dry and with a touch of lactic. Theres an inherent  sessionable feeling here - Im impressed by this one , overall.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
3568,"2016-06-17",4.0,"750ml bottle. 3/8/16 bottle date. Appearance: Cloudy pale golden, with a white head that dissipates quickly. Appears to have strong carbonation. 
Aroma: Strong, distinct orange citrus with a light lactic acid and coriander
Taste: Wow. Light, orange citrus and malt sweetness that aggressively turns to a sharp acidic sour. Just a touch of salty coriander and orange peel on the finish. Quite a bit of complexity for the style. Combination of orange peel and high acidity is reminiscent of a fresh lemon. 
Mouthfeel: Light bodied with a high carbonation. 
Finish: Lingering sharp lactic acid and orange peel. 
Overall: Best gose Ive had by far, mainly because I prefer the higher acidity versions of the style. May be too acidic for style, but has an amazing complexity of orange peel, coriander, and acidity that isnt found in most fairly one dimensional Goses. Highly recommend this one for sour fans.","","TH28"

3568,"2016-04-21",3.8,"The beer pours lightly hazy orange with very little head. The aroma has salt, minerals, orange and is very bright. It has a light crisp body with s light amount of carbonation. The taste has a lot more sourness thats on the citric side, but the brightness of the orange and salt is still there. There is also some floral notes. The finish is crisp and refreshing with more juiciness. Solid.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
3568,"2016-04-16",3.9,"Poured from a bottle. 
Aroma is rather orange forward with a strong juiciness and some light wheat notes. Light acidity in the aroma. 
Pours slightly hazy, with a golden orange color and a small, thin, white head that recedes immediately to the edges where it lingers for a bit. No lacing or legs. 
Flavor has a medium light sweetness with a dry finish. Lots of orange notes with some medium light saltiness. Light grain notes. Hints of phenolics. 
Mouthfeel is medium light bodied with medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a pretty nice orange gose. Lots of orange flavors and aromas. Nice saltiness without being too assertive. Fairly dry. Another nice beer from Crane.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

3568,"2016-01-12",4.2,"This is truly a phenomenal Gose...probably the best I have had of the style. Dangerously refreshing, the orange is up front and authentic. There is a malt background but the citrus is the star and it takes the stage in a well deserved way. I could drink these all day in the summer...and winter...and spring and fall as well.","Lees Summit, Missouri, USA","agrumke"
3568,"2015-12-29",4.0,"Hazed orange body, becomes completely opaque with the yeast addition. Thin foam layer, spotty lace. 
Aroma is juicy and tart, full of fresh orange zest and crisp acidity.
Taste packs a puckering sour punch and juicy orange flavor, sort of like a sour mimosa.
Light to medium bodied and somewhat yeasty. Crisp and clean with a mild salinity and nicely dry finish.
Great first impression from these guys, and Im eager to drink it again. Looking forward to trying the rest of their lineup.","RIP Johnnies, Chicago, Illinois, USA","emerge077"

3568,"2015-12-28",3.9,"750 ml bottle purchased at Ranchmart Wine and Spirits in Leawood, Kansas. 11 5 2015 on the label affixed to the top of the cap. The pour is a cloudy yellow orange with a 1 inch white head that is foamy and falls fast. The aroma is fresh mandarin orange fruit, soft tartness and salt towards the back. All aromas are soft, natural and well integrated. The taste is the salt tartness up front, then moves to the full fresh orange flavor and shows grass and coriander in the back. The palate is light bodied with soft carbonation and a clean tart orange fruit finish. Crisp, clean and nice.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
