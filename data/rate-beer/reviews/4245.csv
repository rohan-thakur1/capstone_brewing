The flavor is heavily sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Full body, creamy/thick texture, soft carbonation, long finish with light to moderate bitterness, moderately alcoholic. Definately a nice surprise. Superior in each aspect: inviting appearence, powerful but not overwhelming aroma, with a balancing acidity and a great, creamy mouthfeel.

I bet if I went back knowing cherries were used I would notice it more.

4245,"2011-11-05",3.7,"Bottle. A black one, with a reddish tint. Theres a reddish touch the head as well, its dense, fingerthick and brown. Some vanilla in the aroma, also a hint of cherries, with roasted malts, coffee, chocolate and a hint of caramel. Unusual flavor for an imperial stout, but the added vanilla and cherries gives it a nice and interesting touch. Some bitterness towards the end. Full-bodied, smooth and lighlty warming. I like it, its unusual, but tasteful. 111105","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

4245,"2011-11-05",3.5,"Bottle. Pours black with a khaki head. Aroma is complex and a bit weird, but interesting; tart and roasted with notes of dark fruit and diarrhea (!) - but in a good way. As it warms, the latter subsides and gives way to notes of chocolate and sweet liquorice. Flavour is dusty with sweet malt, chocolate, spicy notes and an alcohol burn. Tart, ashy, dry, sweet roasted finish. Overall it walks a thin line between a complete clash of notes and being well-balanced; its interesting and pretty good, but doesnt go all the way. Also, rather cloying in the long run. 05.11.11.","Frederikssund, DENMARK","NosirIwont"

En knaldsort skabelse med brunt soft. Duften er kaffe og chokolade; kirsebær-smagen skinner ikke igennem før smagen hvor den efterlader en sursød bismag i det kaffeprægede landskab. Tyk og cremet indtryk. Lækker.","Nysted, DENMARK","flemmingwillum"
4245,"2011-10-31",4.0,"Bottle. Pours jet black with a medium creamy dense brown head. The aroma is hard roasted malt, chocolate, light coffee, vanilla and sweet cherries. The flavour is bit sour at first. Then comes the hard roasted malt and the vanilla and chocolate and it ends up with a cherries sour note.","Helsinge, DENMARK","Plovmand"
4245,"2011-10-30",3.6,"50 cL bottle. Pours dark brown to black with a small tan head. Aroma is dark roasted malt, mixed vanilla and just a hint of cherry. Cherry becomes more distinct for each sip of the beer and becomes somewhat disconnected from the rest of the beer. The dark malt and vanilla seems to stick well together - although a bit too vanilla. Strangely it somewhat works together yet for the most as three disconnected flavours: dark malt, cherry and vanilla.","Copenhagen O, DENMARK","yespr"

Pours completely black with a small, creamy, pinkish beige head. Aroma is sweet, chocolate, cherries. Medium carbonation, fine dry and light tartish mouthfeel. Flavour has chocolate, light coffee, mild fruit. Lingering dry, mild acidic and fairly bitter finish. A very nice fruit/stout combo.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"
4245,"2011-10-29",3.6,"Bottle, 50 cl. Pours pitch black with a nice mocha brown head. Aroma has a lot of cherries and christmas spices - especially cinnamon. Behind that notes of chocolate and vanilla mostly, but also caramel and roasted malts. But pretty dominated by cherries and christmasness. The taste is kinda weird. It has the sour cherries up front, but also another type of red berries, more specifically red currants, which has some astringency that also shows in the beer. Im surprised in how not roasted this beer is. The cherries make it rather fresh, but also christmas spices dominate the taste. A hint of sweet chocolate in the finish, but the finish is mainly focused on the astringency and spiciness from the cherries. Surprisingly quaffable for a 11% beer, but it gets a bit much.","Copenhagen (formerly Aalborg), DENMARK","phredrik"
