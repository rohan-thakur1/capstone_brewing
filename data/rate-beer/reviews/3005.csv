3005,"2013-06-25",3.6,"At the brewery sample 
This is clear brew with slight luminus tint. Bolder yet with refinement level you wont find in your typical bottle of generic sake. There is alcohol heat but goes so well with coconut water like mid softness. Hnted with rose and hibiscus. Levels above sake wise I had in past.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"
3005,"2012-10-21",3.3,"Bottle, pours a clear, aroma is ricy and fruity, a bit of a pear kind of taste with a ricy finish, overall this one was decent","Ontario, CANADA","Ontbeertaster"
3005,"2012-09-08",3.5,"It pours clear with a bit of a champagne tint. The aroma has notes of: almonds, alcohol (heavy), rice-husks (sweet rice), and slight resin. The taste is medium sweet that finishes medium-heavy tart and slightly astringent (but pleasant); there are notes of: almonds, pine-nuts, rice-pudding, alcohol, slight smokiness, and papaya. The palate is full-bodied, slight viscosity, and a long nutty finish. Overall, a really nice sake, lacks a little complexity.","Ontario, CANADA","chris__hartley"
3005,"2012-06-20",3.6,"Clear.  It has a little koji on the nose.  The genshu is stronger and woodier than the other regular ones.  Earthy.  Lip-smacking finish.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
3005,"2012-05-29",3.4,"At brewery. Clear. Aroma of koji, coconut, Asian pear, palate is young and lively with underripe pear. Not my favorite of the pack but quality.

3005,"2011-06-28",3.5,"Pale straw but with a slightly darker tint than the regular nama nama. More full bodied with a rich sort of unctuous palate. Similar ester profile but a bit richer on the palate. The alcohol has a bit of bite on the palate but the peppery aroma is somewhat less than in regular. A bit of acidity as well - lends an almost umami-like savoury character to the product.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
