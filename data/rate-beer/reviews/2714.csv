2714,"2016-01-03",3.9,"5%ABV. Pilsner. 

Tapped out a slightly hazy gold. 5ºSRM.

Nose has some nice bright citrus aromas of grapefruit and lemons. There is a fresh pine scent as well. There is an invitingly sweet aroma of fresh ripe yellow pineapple. 

Mouthfeel is sudsy. Palate is beery with a light wheaty sweetness leavened by the body of raw dough and wheat flour. There is a nice wonder bread like fullness to the body which is medium. There is some very pleasant residual malt sweetness at the end of the palate. Overall keeps to the promise of being a pils, drinks with a full-bodied palate, but without the overly sour or floury body of a wit or a wheat beer and with just enough hop presence. 

Finish is hoppy and clean. A very nicely crafted pils. Right next to Lagunitas this is my favorite.

2714,"2015-10-07",3.5,"Bottle BBE: 28 Aug 2016. Cellar temp. Pours a slightly hazy, pale amber body with a medium, lasting, loose, frothy white head. Very hop forward for a lager, with medium intensity citrus, herbs, nettles and a little pepper. Nicely balanced to taste, with a medium-light heather honey sweetness firmly underlined by a medium, crisp bitterness. Theres a bit of body, probably light medium, with a gently coarse texture. Carbonation is high-medium and the finish is honeyed and sweet with a slight alcohol astringency. Lacking the subtlety of a classic pilsner, but well-balanced nonetheless.
