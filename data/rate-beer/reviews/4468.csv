4468,"2009-04-25",4.0,"Growler, thanks to WeeHeavySD for sharing! Pours a deep reddish-brown with an off-white head. Big aroma, of malt, dark fruits, baked goods, and sugar. Sharp and sweet taste, of malt, figs, dates, brown sugar, baked goods. Lingering sweet sharpness. Strange, but very tasty.","San Diego, California, USA","dalekliz"
4468,"2009-04-11",4.1,"Growler courtesy of the thick freak himself, Charles.  Thanks for picking this up for me.  A Growler of an Eisbock, that sounds nice 11% abv also nice.  Hard as hell to open, ah I perserver.  Pours deep amberish purple wiht a small head.  Nose is sweet rich malty and full of dark fruit.  Taste is sweet malty and fruity.  Damn tasty and damn smooth.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
4468,"2008-02-22",4.1,"This was tasty @ Winterfest.  Dark amber color with sweet malt and molasses on the nose and some of that ""chilled"" character I expect in Eisbocks.  Similar flavor with a strong alcoholic finish.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
4468,"2008-02-11",4.0,"Finally got to try some Mister Spock Eisbock, and it better be a lot better than that Romulan Ale I had at the Star Trek Experience in Las Vegas last summer! On draught during the Winterfest 2008 in downtown St. Paul, Minnesota. Pours a dark reddish amber brew with a a creamy off-white head that has some good retention and some spotty lacing. Aroma of dark malt, molasses, some caramel, dark rum, and a touch of cherry. Taste is full bodied, high alcohol character with flavors of molasses, rum, some caramel malt, cherries and a touch of vanilla. Finish is strong alcohol presence with a caramel and cherry aftertaste that slowly dissipates clean. As Mr. Spock would put it, ""Fascinating.""","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
4468,"2007-11-18",3.8,"On tap at the 2007 GTMW: Transparent copper mahogany with a frothy small-bubbled wispy-lacing dark tan head.  Sweet rich dark caramely German malty aroma has some light fruity notes.  Body starts sweet and caramely malty with some earthy bitter notes toward a warming finish.  A pretty decent eisbock.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
4468,"2007-08-14",4.0,"GTMW. Ive been looking forward to this one as Im a fan of eisbocks, although good ones are difficult to find. This did not disappoint. Notes of vanilla, caramel, cherry, and peach lead into a sticky palate with a dark rum finish. Well crafted and enjoyable. A nice change of pace from some of the super hoppy beers that were around that day.","Illinois, USA","Philip"
4468,"2007-08-13",3.7,"On tap at GTMW, and Ive been looking for this one for a while!  Poured a surprisingly clear deep caramel with a yellowy-beige head.  The aroma picked up sweet, tasty caramels with supple darker fruit as well.. warm and inviting.  The flavor picked up more of the dark fruit than the nose.. rum-laden with toasty caramel farther down.. warm, alcohol-accented herbal hoppage on the bitter finish.. couple medicinal notes detracted a bit.  Heavily-bodied and bitter throughout.. just OK balance and feel on the finish.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
4468,"2007-03-25",4.2,"cereal, chocolate, citrus, red, clear, tan foam, medium sweetness, lightly bitter, heavy cloying sweetness, medium body, sticky, This beer was so interesting, i do not know how to explain, if you ever have a chance to drink it, do not pass it up.","Hibbing, Minnesota, USA","RJBennett"
4468,"2007-02-10",4.2,"Dark, bit red, at first glance Id thought theyd given me an imperial stout by mistake.  Very malty and fruity, lots of candied raisins, sugars, plums, nuts, and a bit of chocolate.  Really, really rich stuff, would be nice to drink by the fire.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
4468,"2007-01-21",3.9,"Winterfest 2007.  One of the better offerings there and Im glad I sampled this.  Malt heavy brew including caramel toffee, dark fruit, rum, vanilla.  Nice sipper indeed.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
4468,"2006-12-19",4.4,"GTM 06. Draught. Not much aroma. A little bit malty, hint of strong alcohol, little bit of fruit. Dark, ruby reddish. Mostly opaque body. Nice red hue. Small tan head. Heavy alcohol. Wow this is good. Cant imagine a better flavor from this beer. Probably the best Fitgers beer Ive had. They need to bring this back because this brew could put them on the map. I only wish I had rated this sooner to help bring it out of obscurity.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
4468,"2006-10-11",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 17, 2010 GTMW 06. Dark amber/brown with wispy tan head. The nose is rum, raisins, caramel and toffee. The flavor is raisins, prunes, toffee and nutmeg. Full, sticky body with soft carbonation.","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"
4468,"2006-08-15",4.8,"Best of Show - tap @ GTMW 2006.  Semi-hazed and chestnut in color with amber edges when held to light.  Dusty, shadows of grey maintain the head.  Aroma is supremely inundated by prunes dancing with aged concord, along with blackberry and mince meat pie dressings.  Caramel courses through the nose carefully so as to not disturb the work of art in the aromatic making.  Sweet, thick cacophony rings with flavors of pecans, caramelized chocolate chews and nutty utterances.  Profound dusted nut wake is chock full of flavor with concentrated cocoa batter turning it up another couple notches.  Full-bodied, with a liquid pool persona seeping with maple, caramel and fanatic chocolate complexities, setting a new standard for American-based eisbocks.  Gentle carbonation meets a Frangelico liquor stream and cant be blown off its course toward near perfection.  Goddamn.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
4468,"2006-08-13",4.2,"GTMW 2006.  The beer pours to a creamy body with a nice mahogany/garnet color.  Lasting tan head.  The aroma is sweet strawberries, concentrated grains, light chocolate.  Nice roast.  The flavor is sweet strawberries, nice barley, sweet profile.  Nice creamy texture.  Smooth.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
4468,"2006-08-13",3.9,"deep maroon color full tan well laced head.  Sweet aroma very light carmels some barley & roast malts.  Full creamy paolate.  Wheat sweet syruppy malts a bit of tartness some light burnt malt in the finish and notes of alcohol  Very good.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
4468,"2006-04-01",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2007 10oz Pour.  Reddish Coloring with White Ring.  Agreeably an Aroma Similiar to Rubbing Alcohol on the Nose.  I was Preparing Myself for a Flavor Attack and Instead the Body of the Beer Seemed Almost Wispy...Smooth and Almost Creamy...A Dense Fog of Alcohol Seemed to Carry the Flavor in and Out of My Taste Buds Making it Truly Hard to Discern What This Brew Was.  Toasted Nuttiness, Light Spice and Fruit...and an Undeniable Dominance of Harsh Alcohol... Heres Hoping the Aging Tones it Down a Bit.   Kudos for Having an Eisbock in Either Case.

Rerated March 07: Brown Color with Red Hue..Light Tan Ring.  Deep, Lightly Syrapy Malt and Alc. Warming Aroma.  Sweet Syrapy Malts...Potent, Yet Held in Check..Some Rye, Dried Fruit, Dried Fig.  Bittering Hops Balance This Big Brew Out in the Aftertaste.. Much Better Overall Than The First Years Batch.  Alcohol Hits More Like a Spirit Than a Beer, but Much More Balanced and Refined in Presence the Raw Force of Last Years Batch.","Minnesota, USA","robertsreality"
4468,"2006-03-17",3.7,"UPDATED: MAR 21, 2007 ORIGINAL (3/17/06). Aroma of phenolic bitter hazlenuts, with a dash of Frangelico and my grandmothers alcoholic bourbon breath. Strong. A hint of bananas and papayas. Pour of reddish amber, with a thin rim of ivory. Flavor is a wicked, crushing flaming hot alcohol, mixed with burnt pecans and ground peanut skins. Bitter as it could be. Alcoholic to a death defying level. Ive had 100 proof vodkas smoother than this beer. Scortches the tounge. Smoothness? This beer needs time. Id say give it four or five years, at a minimum, taste and see. Then maybe give it a few more. It does have potential to say the least. I did enjoy the opportunity to try this now, so I can see what an aged version is like in the next couple of years.
RETASTE (3/19/07). On tap at the brewpub. Ruby pour, sticky tan rim. Aroma crisp of nuts galore in all types and well roasted and oiled. Biting with alcohol. Flavor carries a tremendous wallop of oak and nut characters, amalgamating into a symphony of malt characters, that blends with chocolate and coffee. Light ruby fruits. Still bitingly harsh in the alcohol and tough to take down. I would still love to try an aged version.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
