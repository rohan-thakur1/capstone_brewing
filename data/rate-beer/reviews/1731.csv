1731,"2016-06-20",3.1,"Bottle. Pours a cloudy orange body under a frothy one finger white head that faded to a wispy film. The nose is fruity and estery with a light banana and clove note. Not a ton of yeastiness in the aroma. The flavor is similar to the aroma, lighter banana, but heavier on the clove, especially on the finish. Medium bodied and just a little clingy with fizzy active carbonation. Meh, this is decent, but not a great example of the style in the traditional sense.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
1731,"2014-08-23",3.8,"DATE REVIEWED: August 21, 2014... GLASSWARE: Weihenstaphaner weizen... OCCASION: catching up on some DVRs...APPEARANCE: dark copper body; very little effervescence; snow white head settles quickly to a sudsy, thin consistency; no lacing... AROMA: warm banana and aromatic bubblegum, with a hoppy citrus dimension; secondary scents like pepper and vanilla can be detected ... PALATE: intriguing balance of soft and strong--smooth mouthfeel but slightly heavier at the throat--revealing an ale character... TASTE: rather nondescript flavor, with lemon hints late and bubblegum, mint and grass--some malty sweetness too...OVERALL: bought as a bomber from the brewery itself, this brew compliments the humid August night well; an easy-drinking, tasty beer that I will seek out when returning to State College next summer....","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"
1731,"2014-06-12",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 4-30-12 - 
Served on tap in a pint glass

Appearance  Served a super hazy orange color with a nice billowy white head. The head faded relatively fast to give only a light amount of lacing.

Smell  Big aromas of yeast and a wheat-bready smell are most dominant. There are also some nice aromas of orange, lemon, banana, and a little bit of spiciness mixed within.

Taste  The taste has a very pleasing wheat backbone. The wheat bread taste is initially complemented with a good dose of yeast cake and some spice. The taste starts out more on the maltier side, but as the taste advances it sweetens as more citrus orange and lemon come to the forefront. Other fruit flavors of banana develop more toward the end. The spiciness intensifies again at the end and when mixed with the sweeter fruit flavors leaves a spicy sweet taste on the tongue.

Mouthfeel  Medium to just a bit above medium in body thickness with a slightly higher than average level of carbonation. The lighter body and the higher carbonation complement the style well and make it a very drinkable brew.

Overall  A wonderfully flavorful session brew. This is one I think Ottos should put on their permanent roaster.","","Darkmagus82"

Tastes of cloves, pepper, banana, wheat, artificial sweetener, fruit, and some bubblegum.  Light to medium body.  Thin, watery texture.  Average to lively carbonation.

1731,"2008-06-28",4.2,"A full flavour hefeweizen.  Thick mouthfeel and full of bannana flavour and aroma.  If you like your hefe bannana like, this one is one to have. Great carbonation.  A fruit shake with thick head and lace.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
1731,"2007-11-12",4.0,"8/18/07 - Sampler at pub.  Good hefe nose, banana and clove.  Same with the taste.  Banana and clove explode in your mouth.  Can tell its very fresh.  Nice lacing, even after sitting in a sampler glass for a while.  Probably one of the best hefes Ive had.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","dpjuart"

1731,"2007-09-10",3.4,"Day-old growler.  Pours a cloudy, honey-orange color; white head with fine-bubbled lacing.  Vanilla and bananas in the aroma; creamy, with some cloves present.  Medium mouthfeel: chewy, creamy, banana-first rendition of a hefe; dry clove presense appears mid-palate, with a soft (slightly flabby) texture throughout; ends with bananas and light cloves.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
1731,"2007-08-24",3.5,"On tap at the brewpub. Aroma yields a particularly chemical nose, with perky clove candy, rich fruity blossoms and nips of floor cleaning solution and band aids. A bit lively for me, but nice to see a strong aroma. Pours a clouded sunset orange, leaning toward and artificial shade of the color. Velvet foam sidles down the glass and forms into a vacuous pool. Flavor speaks of richness, but finds balance in a tart, wheat soda. Theres a bubbly tingle that blends with a the curt acidity in the beer, keeping this one a little more towards a sipper. Reaching out for hops, I find only peach nectar and light spice in the smack. I figured something was off, but I enjoyed the lactic tang in wheat. It came out as confused but still drinkable and not nasty.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
1731,"2006-09-26",3.6,"I am a bit of a wheat fan so I was a bit biased in favor of this one. Sampled on draft at the brewery this beer poured a bright golden color with a medium sized white head. The aroma is wheaty and grainy with light spicy and fruity undertones. The flavor is yeasty and bready with a nice mix of citrus and bubblegum. The body is surprisingly thick. A nice hefe.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"
1731,"2006-08-21",2.3,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2009 Draught at the brewery.  Back on in May 2007, and this most recent batch is kind of bad.  Lactic infection tasting, couldnt finish a pint it was so moldy, very young and not completely fermented, really too full of brewers yeast.  Not good.  Heres my review for the 2006 batch: cloudy thick-looking orange and dark yellow colored body, with a small white head.  Frothy, creamy smooth texture.  Lightly spicy banana esters as well.  Lightly bready as well.  Sour lemon and peach flavors are present, with some chewy and creamy peach rind and yeast flavors.  Good, but lacking a depth of complexity.  More peach in the nose than bananas, actually, which is kind of nice.  Palate is moderately syrupy and peppery.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1731,"2006-05-11",3.1,"Draft.
Little aroma.
Cloudy look, typical hefeweizen. Taste is pretty decent and goes down smooth. Goes good with food.","Easton, Pennsylvania, USA","jason"
1731,"2005-06-09",4.0,"Amber Marigold color that is slightly cloudy.  Medium head that dissipates quite quickly and leaves little lacing on the glass.  Bitter taste in the spirit of a hefe with a palette of little floral spicing, tart and semi-dry with a hint of sweetness.  Nose is of tart grapes, a white zinfindale?  Mouth feel is smooth and rich, but a little dry.  Very Drinkable.  Defiantly an excellent brew, topples last years showing.  I cant wait to try this years Belgian Wit.","State College, Pennsylvania, USA","DunmoreDrinker"

Light sweetness and yeasty/wheaty. Banana bubblegum notes. Light bitter sweet finish and after. A refreshing German wheat. Spicy notes in the after.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"
