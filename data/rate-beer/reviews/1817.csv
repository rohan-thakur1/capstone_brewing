Aroma of roasted and burnt malt, moderate smoke, spent coffee grounds, ash, dark bread, slight bakers chocolate core, a little liquorice, only slightly sweet from the malt core. Flavour is slightly more sweet but still dominated by impressive layers of roasted and burnt malts, ashy, somewhat smoky, bitter black coffee, some dried fruit, liquorice, a bit of dark caramel, earth, and fairly substantial liquorice that builds into the finish. Combined with burnt malt and coffee grounds, it makes for a dry bitter finish with lingering smoke. Medium bodied with slightly above average but smooth carb.

1817,"2016-08-18",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 5, 2016 I just realized Ive never rated this beer despite it being the beer Ive had the most of besides Grøn Tuborg/Carlsberg HOF being served at concerts, sport events and other places. When going out for beer, dice and games on small bars, I always try to find a bar with this beer and can drink this all night. An absolute favourite of mine and along with Orval it ranks so very high in drinkability and cravings. I often find myself wanting this. I may not be an alcoholic, but this beer gets me d*mn close! My rating is of course influenced by my feelings for this beer and the well known characteristics. I actually own an example of this from when Urban used to brew it. I have a few samples left from when Peter did the first experiments put out to locals and selected beer aficionados around 2005, where he used ale yeast. Ive shared this with other Ratebeerians, as I had the fortune of getting a crate of this along with crates of two other experiments. 

Bottle. Pours black with a dense, light brown head. Lovely aroma of tar, smoke, licorice. chocolate, plumbs and roasted malt. Flavour is moderately sweet at first with smoke, roasted malt and licorice taking over ending in a burned bitter finish with the trace of smoke still present in the alcoholic warmth going down. Lovely stuff. Thanks, Peter for getting this beer right and making it part of my beer drinking habits for 20-25 years.

And dont bother to eat, as it fills you with its immensely rich taste of smoke, liquorice, tarred ropes, bitterness and just plain ""blackness"". Not for the faint at heart, but so rewarding when you have the energy to tackle it - especially on a cold winters day.

1817,"2013-11-29",4.7,"Bottle, from Sjøbeck Øl & Vand, thanks to Hanne for accommodating. For a dark beer lover, this was an absolutely thrilling experience. The aroma was initially quite leathery and alcohol pungent, like a rough Imperial Stout, but it soon broke down into coffee and metal notes. Not aluminium or tin. I am talking good old black, rusty cast iron. Old ploughing disks or cast iron coffee mills. Actually, theres a farming core to the scent, like from a traditional coffee farm in South America, where the berries (not beans, please) are selected through water canals. Past that phase of pure enjoyment of the nose, I must say that this is another thick oily black Danish Baltic Porter, only dark brown in the edges as it pours, with a lovely light brown head. The flavours invade the tasting buds like a pillaging horde. The liquorice and the salt! Very salty beer. Absolutely lovely, with molasses, nuts and dark chocolates, but it is the salty liquorice that stand out, like a good oyster stout, like it has been brewed with salted almonds. That salty bitterness, not too roasty, not too herbal, and it lingers on the palate for an incredible long time. There was so much coffee in the nose, but hardly on the flavour, which is good in my opinion. This is a full-body oily, chalky, creamy beauty that is among the best beers I have ever had. Theres no stopping for the hurdles of getting more bottles of this wonder from across the world.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"

Taste is dry, roasty, lots of dark chocolate and dark bread crust. Cant really pick out the licorice here. Finishes maybe just a little on the dry side, some deeper malt flavors might round out the taste a bit. Mouthfeel is spot-on, smooth and velvety and very full.

1817,"2011-03-04",3.0,"I bought the beer in a local supermarket (Super Brugsen), and the price was only 9 kr, which is around 1 euro. pr. 33 cl. bottle. I love porters and stouts, but didnt have high expectations. However:

The beer looks really good. It has a nice head, which fades pretty fast (typically ""bottlestyle""). 

The foam is beige and has a very intense smokey scent. 

The dark, almost black beer (not good lighting conditions) looks great. 

The taste is awesome. The carbon-stingyness is pretty noticeble, almost like a lager. The beer is easy to get down, yet very intense. Almost salty - liqourice, smoke and hops. The taste is fresh at first, then evolves into the smokey, spicey tones, and after the shochwave has settlet it slowly fades out but stays with you for at least 10 minutes. 
This beer has personality, it is not anonymous, and would be easy to distinguish from fellow porters. It can be explored, let me put it like that. 

All in all a very good beer, especially compared to the price. I can do nothing but recommend it. Even if it doesnt fall in your taste it is well worth the money.","DENMARK","DeuxExCorpus"

The nose is quite strong. There are hints of licorice, smoke, roasted malts, chocolate and a pinch of coffee.

The flavors follows the taste with thick malty flavors of coffee, roasted malt, hint of licorice, some fruitiness, cocoa, and a hit of sugar. The alcohol is pretty unnoticeable. The mouthfeel is thick and lightly carbonated.

This is a very good beer. It is highly unique for the baltic porter style, it is more of an american styled porter. It is sweet and decadent but perhaps not so much as the common baltic porter. But it is a nice balanced imperial style porter worth picking up.

How: Bottle 330ml.  A few times.  This rating for a relatively fresh bottle (4 months after purchase) sent to me by HogtownHarry.  Thanks a lot Harry
The look: Black body topped by a medium beige head
In long: The nose is superb on this one.  Some kind of smoky chocolate cake aroma.  Taste is black cake malts (very cake), milk chocolate, some red apples, smoke, cacao, coconut, caramel, green grass.  The roastiness level is in the medium-high range and it makes the beer feel quite dry although I could sense that it is actually quite sweet.  A little tartness.  Something pleasantly strange about the yeast signature here, almost feels like a rustic Saison yeast. Body is full and the carbonation is a bit aggressive which lightens the beer out.  This is scarily easy to drink.  Id go as far as to say that this is very much sessionnable.  An outstanding black beer (smoked? stout? porter? whatever).  I drank this beer while watching Dancing With The Stars on my iPad, wearing my designer Gucci shoes and my tight purple shirt.

Ive never actually tasted leather, so I sometimes feel a bit stupid using it as a taste reference - but its the closest thing I get.

Definitely a pretty, yet fairly mean looking porter. Licorice is definitely evident in the aroma, as the herbal liquor notes are hard to miss. Smoked wood and light ham are also there, as well as some malted black grains, light peppery spices, and some earth. With an aroma like that, you would normally expect some fairly intense flavors, but the opposite is the case here. This a very smooth, and mellow tasting beer for the most part. There is just the slightest twinge of booze right in the finish. Herbal liquor and smoked grains do play a part, but not nearly as big as in the aroma as the malt mostly take over. Dark malted grains, bittersweet fruit candy, mellow earth, and also some slightly funky peppercorn notes.

Pours very dark brown, medium thickness, with a good tan head that leaves a foamy cap and a lot of nice lacing.  Aroma is roasted malts, dark fruits, some light sourness or is that soy sauce?  Licorice is plentiful, some chocolate, coffee, a bit of smoke.  Flavor is roasted malts, licorice, chocolate, coffee, somewhat acidic and astringent on the finish, more so toward the bottom of the glass.  Mouthfeel is full, creamy, with a fair amount of prickly carbonation.  While still no Sinebrychoff, this does benefit from a warmer serving temp like the Koff does.  Much better this second time around.
Original review Dec 17, 2009.
Pours dark brown with a small beige head that reduces to a ring.  Tiny bit of lacing.  Aroma is licorice, roasted malt, light coffee, light smoke.  Flavor is more licorice, a little chocolate and coffee.  Finish picks up some smoked meat notes as I work down the glass.  Body is on the thin side, low carbonation.  OK.

Medium-bodied; Roasty flavour up front with a good pit fruit taste coupled with coffee and burnt sugars. Aftertaste shows a lot of malt, roasty and toasted oats, alcohol and quite a bit of anise and fennel tastes.

1817,"2009-08-30",3.9,"01.07.09 dated bottle. Pours black with thin mahogany highlights when held to light and a creamy, 1 finger tan head that fades to a thick skim and ring fairly quick and holds there, leaving some parse lacing. Aroma is roast, bitter chocolate, smoke, burning wet leaves, leathery tannin notes, and some slight basement and wet forest funk. More vinous qualities come out as it warms. Flavor is roast, smoke, oak, dry licorice notes, char, some dried dark fruit notes, bittersweet chocolate and what seems like an errant pine note near the finish. Finishes roast, char, wet leaves, charred wood, bitter hops, and bitter dark chocolate. Palate is medium bodied, dry throughout, with a light-yet pretty sharp carbonation and a dry, bordering on astringent finish. This stuff took a bit to grow on me, not so much that it improves as it warms, but that I really had to get my head around what was going on here. This is a very interesting brew, it reminds me of a good aged porter or stout gone right, still I found some aromas and flavors to be a little at odds with me loving this brew to death. Certainly I am picking nits here, as this is a fantastic brew, that just made it all the more frustrating as I think with a little more sweetness and a little less tannins(?) and astringency this could be mindblowing. I will definitely have to pick this up again when I can.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

Halfway between the smell of backyard grilling inferno and the smell of branding cattle. There is a little chocolate sweetness buried under all the meat, but it competes in vain for attention. Flavor is more meat and char, a bit of milk chocolate. A decidedly mixed set of characteristics borne along in a very soft and appealing full palate. As a pairing to steaks ""grilled"" by being subjected to a three foot column of flames, this might be perfect.

Toward midway an assertive rauch-ness surfaces bringing with it notes of smoke, charred wood embers and a touch of band aid to go along with spice and black licorice.

The nose shows a strong smoky and gamey overtone, with biting, dusty brett notes lending an ""ancient"" sort of feel. Underlying malts are comprised of ultra-dry, dark cocoa and traces of dried caramel. Burnt licorice and pepper notes lend spicy complexity. Flavors are equally impressive, rich and ultra roasty, with a decadent dark cocoa base being accompanied by a myriad of earthy, dusty, bretty notes and a strong overtone of old oak. The palate is substantial, semi-lively, and bone dry, with an obvious brett feel that lingers long and bitter.

Black, brief fizzy tan head. Aromatic chocolatey and burnt aroma, not huge, but most pleasing. Quite lively carbonation. Richly roasted malts come to the fore, but leave a quite potent acrid one-two of hops and burnt malts on the palate. Decent residual sweetness, but as the fruitier vapours rise up your nose you realise it’s alcohol that’s carrying them there. Quite a smack in the chops, but not entirely unsophisticated. Needs to lose some fizz and thicken up a bit, then tone down the charcoal to get really big points off me. Probably better draught.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"

1817,"2007-08-16",3.8,"Bottle from Engelsmann drunk on 6/28/07Nice fluffy brown-tinted-beige head atop a glowing, ruby-amber body with low carbonation and a high clarity.  Head eventually recedes to cover, leaving light lacing.Dates, hazelnuts, marzipan, toffee, brown sugar!!  Wow, this is some decadent stuff, but at least quite complex.  Liqueur-like alcohol warmth mixes with the sweet, above-mentioned notes, while a profound toffee maltiness soothes the nose.  Towards the end, I get an interesting note of bitter orange peel or resin, that seems to sit on the back of a lightly smokey, moderately roasty note.  However, it ends decidedly more clean and sweet, with vanilla and brown sugar mixing together and tapering off in a toffee laden finale.  Medium strength of aroma, no flaws.  Interesting and like many of these cult beers, the complexity/originality of it is its strong point.Raisins and toffee keep things sweet as I take a sip, while the smokiness comes out even moreso in the flavor.  Really unique, lovely mix of dry woodsmoke, alcohol warmth and sort of a rum raisin note, for lack of a better descriptor.  Top this off with some brown sugar, a very soothing, malty texture and medium-low carbonation that stays out of the way, and youve got yourself an excellent sweet sipper.  Vanilla and oily prune-like vinousness dance about on the finish as well, and the smoke is done tantalizingly tastefully.  Dosent blow you out of the water, but keeps you wanting another sip.  On the sweet side, of course, but dosent bludgeon you with crude sugars or a syrupy body (though with warming and breathing, the creaminess does begin to get a bit heavy).  Dosent seem like much of a baltic porter to me.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1817,"2007-06-13",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 28, 2007 Medium sized creamy head, tan with white remnants. Light, soft looking lacing. The body is a sensuous shade of dark auburn brown with shimmering blood red peeking out from deep within. The head diminishes somewhat, leaving fat groups of bubbles at the edge - the clusters resemble an outline of flower petals around the visible body. What a shocking aroma! Moderate smoke entanged with heavily roasted grains, Dutch chocolate and bristling with caramel and aniseed. Alcohol is well concealed thus far. Starfruit, raisin bread and peanut butter make flighty appearances. This is utterly complex and certifiably one-of-a-kind. Smoke in the nose is reminiscent of the effect of running a beer through lines that accomodated a rauchbier not long ago, such as the residual effect noticed all too easily (and to my delight) in Schlenkerla Helles. A marvelous addition to most any roasty beer, certainly permissible in this scenario. Flavor is chock full of the aforementioned components, but the center of attention is the roast and smoke one-two punch. Bitterness is mild to moderate, sweetness about the same. Alcohol is still fairly well masked. The last part of each sip gives me a feeling that resembles just melted chocolate gliding slowly down my throat. The finish is very smooth, leaving behind a lightly smoky and heavily roasty and chocolatey blend, as well as lingering hints of vanilla and scorched earth. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, velvety, but unleashes crushing malt and the palate is overall very affable. Carbonation is medium but remains soft and enhances the drinkability. An absolutely wonderful treat. This will remain a sought after beer for me. A few more should do.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

1817,"2007-04-14",3.6,"Pours dark with a copper head from the bottle-even though I brought it back from DK a couple of months ago. Smells great and looks great too. 
There are some hints of coffee, licorice, and smokiness in the smell-but it isnt overpowering at all. I think that it drinks relatively smooth for a beer with an ABV this high, but it isnt for the faint of heart as it is a porter (or Double Brown Stout according to the label.) I could drink these all night as they arent too filling initially, but you do feel the ABV a bit after drinking it so watch out!

1817,"2007-02-01",4.4,"Im lucky that this world class beer is available in many of the restaurants and inns around here, where the alternative is a more or less boring pale lager (Im allergic to wine). The first time I had it - I was terrified! But later when I started to appreciate the stouts, it soon became one of the favourites. The body is pitch black and the head is huge, creamy and dark nougat brown. The aroma has notes of smoke, tar and licorice and the mouthfeel is oily. The flavour has a lot of bitter chocolate and licorice, but it also has notes of coffee, smoke, roasted malt and a lot more. Its like this beer is an on-going experience, I find new sides of it every time I drink it. Sometimes it feels rough and raw - and sometimes its like smooth and fine velvet.

Pours a deep brown wiith a one finger brown/tan head.  Aroma is fairly smoky with some anise, followed by some roasty malts and a vinous and raisiny character.  There is also a tinge of saltiness and acidity.  Flavor is the same with the smoke dominating.  I did get a little vanilla in one of the swallows, though I didnt notice anise any more.  I would say this medium bodied, though it seems a bit watery.  I know this doesnt really make sense, but this is how I feel.

1817,"2006-12-15",4.1,"I like the new Danish microbrews, but you are not to laugh of the old danish breweries either. There are some real goodies between; for example this Limfjords Porter named after a beautiful Danish inlet. The head of this beer is big and beige, and diminishes slowly. Its colour is completely black. The aroma is very smoky with coffee beans, a lot of roasted malts and a little sourishness too, which I think is rather typical for Thisted Bryghus beers. The flavor is smoky with obvious coffee and liquorice and a constant bitterness from both malts and hops. In the aftertaste this dry beer becomes very bitter from the hops, and has a lot of smoke and liquorice. The body is just perfect for the beer, and it is very creamy. Maybe this beer is not brewed with the same care as Ølfabrikken Gammel Ekstra Porter, and maybe there are not used as big amount of ingredients, but the smoky flavor makes it at least as interesting, if not more.","Nysted, DENMARK","flemmingwillum"

Smoky tobacco prevails more in flavor with a bit of singed ash tree and charcoal traces.  Dry, smoky flair weaves between milk chocolate and bittersweet bricks.  Hint of sulfur arises but is bested by roasted pecans frolicking in cocoa dust.  French roast grinds scatter with mocha beans and then get whammed by a hammer.

Opened as the night was winding down, this was a nice treat.  I havent had

   put into this one.  Thanks to StewartOfGondor, who I believe was the one
   responsible for bringing it.  If not, let me know who it was and I will
   update the rating.
Aroma / Appearance - Smoke, cocoa powder and ritz crackers were the
   main players in this nose.  It looked almost like flat Pepsi, though there
   may have been something going on in the body.  It was very dark soaking up
   all light, thus making it impossible to tell for sure.  The lacing and head
   were both a dirty mocha color.
Flavor / Palate - Butter, coffee, smoke and butterscotch came across
   the first two sips.  Next was a chocolately taste that reminded me of the
   high end chocolates you can buy at a grocery store; not quite boutique but
   not the waxy cheap stuff either.  Very solid and enjoyable until the end

Smoky, ashy aroma is a mix of BBQ and cigarette butts. Roasty malts beneath that, but I dont really get any coffee, chocolate, raisin, prune or licorice. Body is deep black with a bubbly but fluffy two finger thick mocha head. Fore is a bit watery. Not thin just not flavorful. Bitter and burnt malts follow and bring some welcome flavor that includes esspresso and bakers chocolate. very charred and burnt like firewood-in the finish. Different, but not something Im enamored with.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"

Not sure how old it was, there were no indications of date. It poured an almost clear, dark brown body, with a minimal head, actually next to none. There were chocolate, licorice, dried fruits, some smoke and a touch of oxidation in the aroma, the kind of aroma one could sniff for minute after minute.

1817,"2004-11-21",4.1,"Dark ruby. Light chestnut foam yields sticky, snowflake lace patterns. Abundant notes of nougat, roasted wood, coal, and smoke permeate the nose. Lightly vinous with fruitcake, molasses, and black currant hints. Tightly carbonated. Somewhat airy. Slightly smoky and rich with a buttered caramel and soft, rounded roasted malt mesh. Roastiness slowly tapers off, giving way to charred wood notes. Highly attenuated, but perfectly sweet, with touches of mocha, vanilla, and bittersweet chocolate. Minimal oxidation offsets some of the sweetness. Light breath of wintergreen-accented alcohol discharges a delicately spicy anise ester, which intensifies the multilayered earthy malts. Relentless char astringency dries it out, backed with a hint of tar, while pummeling the dark fruit nuances in the finish. Aside from the lightly oxidized aroma and flavor, this should only improve as it ages. Already decadent, though, as is. Thanks, Dixen!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Sort of like the (in my opinion) Dark Lord of the Baltic Porter appearance world.  The aroma is incredibly strong and almost too much.  Super strong roasted malt aroma with bread turned charcoal, fresh ground coffee beans, intense smoke,  light notes of dark chocolate and a touch the aforementioned licorice.  Thick and full in the mouth, this is a creamy dream of a beer.  Incredibly malty with great roasted bitterness that just dominates the flavor.  The previously too-intense smoke comes to be a nice compliment to the insane malts.  A hint of chocolate and caramel sweetness moves to the forefront in the middle before embracing it's ultimate role as submissive to the massive malts.

1817,"2002-12-11",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2003 A heavy mouthful from one of Denmark's few independent regional breweries, which I'm always happy to support every summer. A nice region with nice people who make several acceptable beers - this is their very best one. However, I have to admit that Gamle Carlsberg Imperial Stout Porter is slightly better. Rerate: Characterized as a 'double brown stout' by the brewery, this stout/porter (in Denmark that's more or less the same thing) is really so different from Gamle Carlsberg Imperial Stout Porter that it's a bit unfair to compare the two. The smoked flavour is really something out of the ordinary. I've never had a rauchbier (*I have now!), but I guess this one has some elements in common with that style (* smoky, but not smoked meat, T.G.). I highly recommend a sample of Limfjords-Porter! Rerate 2: Hey, this beer grows on you! Black (okay, extremely dark brown) as the deadliest of sins, moderate thick tan head, aroma and flavour of tar, resin and midsummer bonfires. Overwhelming smoked bitterness. Tastes like it's been stored in a Viking ship through seven battles and a round-the-world tour. Simply outstanding.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"
