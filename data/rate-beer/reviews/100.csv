100,"2017-01-17",4.6,"Bottle in Seattle. Rainy night tasting. Huge thanks to Laurence for finding a bottle of this for me. A fantastic treat, tried immediately after the Premiere. Gorgeous dark cognac orange pour. Still, heavy body. Fascinating red apple aroma, exoticly fresh and lightly tropical. A hint of alcohol. First sip: wow. So rich and astoundingly delicious. Apple umami. Creamy, swirling sweet syrup. A touch of spice from alcohol, which perfumes everything. Complex, deep apple notes that I didnt know existed in nature. Treacle, nut-apricot turkish delight, honey depth. Sweet without being overbearing. A lightly toasted tobacco edge, much darker notes than the Premiere. This just makes me think of Turkey for some reason. Delicious treat.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
100,"2017-01-17",4.6,"Bottle poured, with much thanks to luttonm for the share. Such a treat to try an ice cider like this. Quintessential, or at least up there with the others that are. Dark copper pour. Pear, caramel apple, brown sugar, sweet, and bold. Flavor is all the same, and perfectly put together. Pear fruit seems to come out for me, but blended nicely with a caramel apple, and soft apple spice. A full array of spiced fruit seem to go into this cider. Nectar seems to be the most fitting word that I can pull out of this description. Delicious, and deserves all the respect it gets. Loved it.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"

Obtained in a trade with tom10101. Thanks! 2009 vintage. Very, very beautiful looking 500 ml. bottle @ home. 15 cl. pour. Freshly opened bottle. Bottle says that it can be kept for 9 months after opening. This one pours quite dark, copper apple juice, darker orange copper, oily rim sticks to the glass on top. Smells of Sirop de Liège, very thick and concentrated apple syrup on top, warming, some Eau-de-vie, wood tannins, vanilla, very clean, high quality alcohol, camomile, lemon essential oil, quite oily, very thick. Taste is quite reminiscent of Sirop de Liège, warming, lingering alcohol, wine tannins, thick caramelized sugar, syrupy thick apple juice, thick maple, touch agave, honey, lemon essential oil, lemon peel, esotheric oils, warming Eau-de-vie, wine tannins, wood vanilla, thick decandent. Very oily and sticky feel to it, slightly watery as well, strangely enough. Tried it woth chilled & room temperature and preferred it greatly at room temperature, this was something else all right. Very unique, rich and decadent. I have a big sweet tooth and I already found 15 cl. to be overkill frankly. Fascinating. ///////////////////// Took another small pour day after opening the bottle.

The alcohol is smoothly integrated into the background, giving a nice even heat that mixes well with brown liquor type flavors. The intense sweetness, thin body, and complex alcohol heat position this is as a weird cider/wine/liquor hybrid. Really opened my eyes to what a cider could be.

100,"2013-10-12",4.7,"Aroma is totally different from the previous 2 ciders. Definitely more of a non apple fruit character with strawberries being very prevalent. There is still a strong apple character though. 
Pours a clear copper amber with ruby highlights. No bubbles or head so no lacing. Medium size legs. 
Flavor is also different than the previous two with a lot more non-apple fruit characters including strawberry. Some light spice and moderate red apple notes. Faint hint of alcohol in the finish. More complex arrangement of flavors than in the previous two ciders. Still very sweet.
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with low to no carbonation. No astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall an amazingly complex ice cider. Its amazing how much non apple character was achieved from the apples with great strawberry and spice notes. Very sweet but it finishes so smooth. This is seriously good stuff.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Closer and deeper inhale reveals intense, deep, rich apple that is the essence of apple, like Eves apple, more apply than apple itself. Proto-apple, apple in Platos Form of apple. Flavor makes eyes roll to back of head from intense delight. Sweetness on the level of a Turkish baklava, unabashed, unrelenting, and unapologetic. Honey married to sweet crisp apples, like pink lady, and underlying currents of jam. After the diabetic coma comes a splash of acidity complements of Mother Apple that rescues the mouth from becoming bogged down but which tortures with its insistence on more (when there is none!). Moderately complex, fully accessible. I dont understand it and wont try, its meant to be enjoyed.

First tried this as Frimas from Joe McPhee at the RBSG 2010 Grand Tasting. It was so damn good in my tiny sample that I had to go and get a bottle via trade with cfrancis.

Poured out a lovely gold elixir that slid out of the bottle. Wide, slow sexy legs melt back into the silky concoction. The aroma is freaking succulent and drool inducing. Endless apples, none with a sour hint, deep sweetness that amazes, the faintest of alcohol, pure heaven - I do not know what else to say about the aroma - it is not complex aside from the depth of the apple goodness - simple wonderful. The taste is unreal. Satisfying to no end. Sweet apple fruit, thick sugar goodness, hint of alcohol and a tart bite that comes in near the end and then sneaks away until the next sip. Very rich and maybe a wood character but Im only half convinced at that claim. Ooozes across my palate and sticks to everything leaving a velvety coating that can be worn down by sucking - and even that is something to look forward to. This is an impeccable delight.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Nous pouvons goûter le gingembre, la pomme cuite, le caramel, le sucre de canne et le sel et oui le sel. Une jouissance à chaque gorgée: de la rondeur, de lépaisseur, de lalcool bien camouflé, du huilleux et surtout de la finesse.

Some alcohol, flowers and honey as well. A bit of swiss cheese or jarlsberg yeastiness might be there as well. Taste is soo sweet, and concertated apples, so amazing, tons of caramel over the 60+ second duration. Mouthfeel is super syrupy, with tons of alcohol, sticky like honey.

Ok you piss taking set of bastards (Tom & Sim) I mean candy apple. Lashings of custard. This is, as Tom describes, like apple pie and custard without the pastry. Big tarty apple bite with plenty of sharp acidty that rather than lingering in the background is brought rushing to the front carried by the alcohol.

The sweetness becomes a bit cloying after a while, and the alcohol presence is strong. It is still delicious, with a supernaturally thick body, delicious apple and grape sugar. There is a touch of acidity early in the sip, with a bit of cookie and cake later. Apples taste is very young, green, not the old, rich apple Ive noticed in Neige and other frozen-juice ice ciders. I couldnt possibly deny the greatness of this beverage, but truth to be told, its not one meant for even moderately large quantities of drinking.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

The aroma is that of pure apple essence, as condensed and concentrated as can possibly be.  It can only be described as the freshest apple juice you have ever encountered, painstakingly reduced to the nth degree.  The flavor is inconceivably perfect, like a million fresh apples that have been crushed in the dead of winter, in the middle of the unadulterated wilderness, and somehow crammed into a tiny package.  A thick, oily body glides over the tongue, effortlessly delivering the sweet apple goodness to each and every corner of the mouth.

100,"2007-12-12",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2009 In short: THE mother of all (ice) ciders.
How: Many times.  Lately I had the three Face Cachée de la Pomme classics (Neige, Neige Éternelle and Frimas) side by side at Montreals Flaveurs, Bières and Caprice Festival 2007.
The look: Stale orange body with no head
In long: The most easily drinkable (dangerously drinkable) of the Face Cachée lineup.  Flavour is concentrated apple juice (as opposed to the apple skins taste of the Neige) and adds touches of apricot.  A bit more syrupy than the others with more of an marmalade/applesauce flavour.  Amazing full and smooth mouthfeel.  Wonderful stuff.  But $50/375ml, ouch!  Oh man one day Id like to get hammered on that stuff.  Some say I have a drinking problem.

Apricot, puree, high-brix honey, molasses, maple, fresh figs, black cherry pit notes in moderation, mild spiciness, white flowers undefined, vanilla, the mildest lavender essence, clove liqueur all hold my attention as long as they please. This aroma is pure, it is dew-scented, it is utterly magnificent. In the flavor, at first, medium-high acidity seems out of place and overdrawn. Sweetness is very high but its not as intense as expected, actually less than the Neige ice cider from the same ciderie, mostly due to relatively high acidity. Bold tropical fruit notes now include pineapple and mango, as well as lesser kiwi. Notes of woodgrain trickle in and back out again. The finish is smooth, sweet, lightly acidic, enduring and succulent. The mouthfeel is extremely full bodied, viscous, sticky, syrupy and sugary. Alcohol is incredibly well concealed throughout this entire experience. A masterpiece.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Wafting from the glass is a symphony of apples, honey, apricots and more apples.  Hints of Keifer lime leaves finish the assault.  The flavor is an intensity the likes of which I have never experienced.  Concentrated apple essence, hints of apricots and slight notes of tropical fruits.  There is an acidity that pulls everything together.  As close to perfection as I think I will ever see.  Re-rated 10-18-09

100,"2007-05-05",4.5,"5/4/07.  Poured out of 375 mL bottle, obtained in a trade with Olivier_MTL on RateBeer 12/3/05.  2003 Vintage.  Pours a deep amber-gold color with good clarity and a bold, beautiful depth of autumn color.  The oily legs on this cider are much broader and slower than those of its brother, the Neige-- tilt the glass and there are times that the high edge of residue takes literally several minutes to droop, like the wax from a freshly-lit candle.  The aroma here is much richer and more succulent also-- some overripe apples and fresh apple sauce (complete with cinnamon accompaniment), as well as soft caramel and a captivating, warming, sweet-liqueur aura.  First taste is decadently sweet with a lightly leathery, lightly waxy tart apple outline.  The finish drops most of the soft tartness that balanced the initial taste and leaves a homemade soft-and-syrupy cinnamon apples and a slight apple pie doughy flavor.  Some zesty alcohol rounds out the mouthfeel, sort of a funny way to balance the gripping sweetness.  This is even more indulgent than its companion, lacking most of the tartness of crisp fresh apples but replacing it with an intoxicating medley of apple desserts that rival the best restaurant creations Ive ever sampled.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

The taste is apple juice, sticky sweet -to the point of almost being tart-apples.  I think I wrote very sweet about three times in my notes.  Its packing enough sweetness that I dont find it enjoyable.  Full bodied, quite syrupy on the tongue, finishes with mild alcohol effervescence.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

The aroma has...apple?...hah...but almost something like pear and plastic as well, definitely intense and fresh, some spice.  Very sweet.  So sweet you just have to confront it and either embrace it or tolerate it.  And I love sweet drinks like port.  For all of its sweetness, the palate is thick but not sticky, somehow.  How does this make me rethink ciders?  It eliminates a lot of the sourness and acidity associated with good quality ciders (esp. English ciders, e.g.)--it is obviously a distant stylistic cousin to English farmhouse cider--while retaining and concentrating the flavors.  But I wish it didnt have to bring the sugars to such concentrations.  Clear but a still yellow appearance.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

Could have been from the wooden barrel. Excellent balance of sweet and tart. Lots of full apple flavour but deep with peach and stewed ripe fruit. Traces of vanilla bounce around.

You better believe I remember the rest, though.A warm-toned honey and apricot colored cider, with some gleaming copper and brass, and darker caramel shades in the middle.  Legs are left in response to swirling the thick, limpid, liquid.  Aroma of cinnamon, cloves, sweet apple skins and pulp, rich butter pie-crust with freshly baked, warm apples and a glass of brandy.  Vanilla and almonds in there as well.  Flavor is explosive, complex and just stupefying.  Rich cinnamon-flavored iced cream, with warm cointreau-soaked apples atop.  Brandy, luscious caramel and full, sweet red apples, never syrupy or cloying.  Powerful finish is warming, well-spiced of clove, allspice, oranges and vanilla.  Body is gentle yet strong, very impressive and easy to sip. Finish does not ""make you pay for it"" by dousing you with alcohol.  Tremendously balanced and just pure flavor from start to finish.  As David says, this one is seemingly perfect in its own right, and takes the route of the wonderfully balanced, full bodied, strong and complex Belgian Strong Ale, whereas a perfect 5 in my book would also be an ultra funky farmhouse cider, for which I have more preference.  This is incredible though.  Glad we discovered it.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Strong applesauce aroma, even more decadent than the pomelle I believe if less powerful and alcoholic. Elegant whole apples, juicy like no other. Red apples, pears, pancakes, toasty, baked nature. Greenish toward the end as it develops the mildest acidity. Incredibly controlled flavours. In mouth, this is one of those sensory overloads, immediate and cutting, one that makes you forget the world exists and take everyone of your concerns away to leave only you, your bubble, the glass, the cider and an ecstatic moment, one that cuts a bit short as you realise youre holding a pen and must express your emotions one way or another. Thickest applesauce palate, as thick as a JW Lees, the dark lord of ciders if you will, cinnamon undertones, slick, only slightly boozy goodness. Almost fuelic and in a good way this time. Greenish tea finish, long and powerful. Utter apple decadence, I cant imagine cider getting any better except for a most funky example that Ive yet to encounter, so this might well be higher rated for me one day as I try more.

100,"2005-02-13",4.6,"Sampled the 2003 Vintage at the cider house.  A bit more dark and caramel coloured than Neige, its viscous and oily and coated the tulip-shaped tasting glass well.  Aroma starts off with a little oak, then a few alcoholic fumes, but not overpowering at all, then comes the fruit salad: lychee, passion fruit, mangoes, and then finishes off with a smell of freshly chopped mushrooms.  Insane.  This elixir tastes like liquid apple pie.  Soft notes of caramel, it feels powerful in your mouth but comes down smoother than silk.  It has a residual sweetness that cancels out any apparent acidity and doesnt give you that ""too much sugar in my bloodstream"" feeling a lot of dessert wines can give you.
