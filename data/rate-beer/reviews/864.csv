864,"2013-06-22",3.5,"Small black bottle with a yellow lettering. Really cool bottle. Poured into a 4 ounce snifter. Pours a pale yellow, nearly the color of water. The aroma has some sweet rice and honey qualities to it. Tastes sweet as well. Not really one to drink mass quantities of, but still fairly pleasant. Much better than I expected.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
864,"2013-03-23",4.0,"750 ml bottle purchase at Michaels in Riverhead.  As an aside, I really like the bottle design, both the shape and the graphics.  Pours clear with some slight interference when looking through the glass.  Pleasant aroma with some very noticeable alcohol vapors along with some rice and a bit of vanilla. The flavor is fruity with some rice and definitely a bit of vanilla.  Very lovely.  Texturally, this sake is like silk on the palate.  A bit boozy but at 18% abv not unexpected and it does not interfere with the enjoyment of this sake.  I could drink this regularly.  Excellent!","Laurel, New York, USA","beerbill"
864,"2013-03-13",3.6,"First Sake rating...Pours a crystal clear very pale yellow...nice legs on the glass.  Aroma of mild tropical fruit and vanilla...rice vinegar...boozy.  Flavor is boozy and rice forward...just a touch of tropical fruit in there.  Mouthfeel is just a bit oily and the finish is boozy rice and warming.","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"
864,"2013-03-10",4.0,"clear as water. very smooth full body.

aroma: a touch of acidity (faint rice-wine vinegar), bitter yeast character (like butternut squash skin); and subtle but enticing esters of bubble gum, banana, grape, and pear. alcohol is surprisingly faint.

taste: sweet nutty rice, more yeast character, smooth alcohol, mild acidity that pops the fruitiness in the middle, and a nice grainy rice note just going into the finish.

soft and smooth. complex, yet subtly so. very nice.","Sanford, Florida, USA","SanfordBrewer"

864,"2013-02-19",3.4,"Nearly clear with no head.  The aroma is strong and the alcohol is evident, but not abrasive.  Dangerously easy to consume; I can sense the alcohol level is high, but it sips very easily.  Dry and soft, potent and refreshing.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
864,"2013-02-13",3.8,"Pours perfectly clear with a very pale yellow color. 

The aroma is fairly boozy, but has lots of strawberry and pair. The rice note is very faint in the aroma.

The flavor is fruity and floral, a bit boozy but complex as well. This is on the sweet end as far as most of the more serious Sakes Ive tried... There is some mild vanilla and a general absence of rice character. 

All around very enjoyable.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
864,"2013-01-12",3.8,"Pours pale yellow-tinged clear body, nice legs. The aroma is pears, melon and coconut. I dont get as much alcohol as I expect with 18%, and no fusil. The flavor is sweet, smooth, complex, and follows the aroma pretty closely. The palate is warming, which makes it a nice sipper for a January afternoon.","Kirkland, Washington, USA","bitbucket"
864,"2013-01-09",3.6,"Bottle. Pours clear with a faint tinge of yellow. Aroma is coconut, almond, a bit of fruit. Flavor is about the same, plus alcohol, lightly sweet, a lot of warming from the alcohol. Light bodied. Nice enough, I guess.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
864,"2012-09-22",2.9,"THOUGHTS: This style must just not be my cup of tea, because I saw that this is one of the top sakes in this style, but it seemed like jet furl to me at first. Then it started to grow on me a little. And then I chilled it some more and it started to become somewhat nice, but still probably not something I would ever drink again.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured clear, lightest possible yellow that was just a hair above being called clear. It also had no head, but it did have beautiful legs. The aroma was alcohol, vanilla, banana, coconut, pineapple, other light fruits and an odd hint of coffee. The initial flavor was slight to lightly sweet and moderately alcoholic; while the finish was lightly sweet, slightly acidic and light to moderately alcoholic with a short duration. There was alcohol, light fruits, white grapes, coconut, vanilla, pineapple, pear, more alcohol and the slightest hint of coffee. The medium to full body was a bit syrupy but also oily and then rather dry; and flat with a heavy to harshly alcoholic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"
864,"2012-08-28",3.3,"Enjoyed this at Hulas in Monterey. $21 for the bottle and enjoyed in shot glasses but sipped. Its a lot of volume for one person.

Slight brown appearance. Nice clarity. 
Nothing in the nose. Maybe almonds and booziness
Very sweet. Very much a toasty profile. Hints of vanilla and spices. Sweet finish.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
864,"2012-04-17",3.7,"Grabbed a bottle because while no good place to beer to go getting quality sake isnt a problem.  Pours light clear yellow.  Nice semi sweet floral nose.  Tastes of flowers, peach, vanilla, and alcohol.  Warming finish.  Very nice and I didnt know Americans even made sake.","New York, USA","Jow"
864,"2012-01-10",3.5,"Bottle.

No head (still).
Body is very light yellow.

Aroma is light notes of autumn leaves / twigs, mold, alcohol, pear/apple skin, melon rind, grain.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.

Medium body, watery/silky texture, no carbonation, moderately alcoholic, lightly astringent.

Quite pleasant.  Mild aroma, but clean and attractive, fruity and autumnal with very little rice glue rawness.  Same goes for the mouth experience...silky, balanced, clean, with just enough tannic grip.  A touch boozy, but less so than expected.  Not earth shaking, but definitely delightful.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
864,"2011-12-02",3.7,"Sweet sleek black bottle.  Pours clear with a yellow gold tone.  Soft sweet rice on the nose, floral and melon notes, and a touch of caramel.   Medium bodied, a light bit of alcohol with a touch of isopropyl to it as well.  Warms up big time, but at 18% I guess thats somewhat understandable.  Supple caramel and warm toast, soft melon.  Warm lingering alcohol on the finish with some more sweetness.  Rather nice.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
864,"2011-06-25",3.2,"Gift from SJ. A thick oily pour with an aroma of coconut and fruits.

864,"2011-04-13",4.3,"My first domestic sake.  My first Genshu.  Unique 750mL bottle.  Pours clear and oily, amazing leggings.   
Aromas of mostly apple juice, vanilla, some grain, loads of alcohol.  sweet scent.   
Flavor is clean, fusel, bright, nice rice wine character.  Soft burn as it makes its way down.  A touch of nutty flavors, soft rice, vanilla, light leather and fruit.  

This has become my favorite style of the Sakés because of this one bottle.   JOY!

864,"2010-01-20",3.4,"Bottle thanks to the Jolly Beer Wench.  Pours almost entirely clear though a little off-white.  Pungent and boozy upfront with hints of apple.  A very nice robust nose.  The flavor is good and smooth but lacking in complexity.  Easy to drink with a very nice almost creamy mouth feel.  I like it, but Ive definitely had better.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Teege"

864,"2009-07-31",3.6,"Pale yellow tinted body that leaves only a little bit of legs when swirled. The nose is sweet and fruity with some notes of peaches and coconuts. There is also a light tropical hint with the fruity character. I find the body to be a little thick with strong coconut and peach flavors. There is a nice alcohol burn in the finish, but it is not unpleasant. Fairly light overall with only a little bit of wood that mostly comes through in the lingering finish. I sampled a few times both room temperature and cooled. I liked it both ways, but preferred it cool.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

864,"2009-06-08",3.6,"Pretty much water white.  Aroma is a bit tight, just a bit of melon.  Flavor is quite powerful.  Tons of cantaloupe and banana.  Full, thick mouthfeel.  This stands up to spicier fare.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","RCL"
864,"2009-05-14",3.8,"Why is this under SakeOne when its blatently momokawa as it says on the bottle and Momokawa has like 6 or 7 other sake entrys and this ""sakeOne Corporation"" has none and it says nothing about  sakeone corporation on the bottle.  Whatever, ill just keep quiet about the gross mismanagement of this database.  Anyway, the nose on this monster was quite nice, actually..a thick blanket of vanilla pudding with stepped on bananas, caramel, white chocolate, and a little thai sticky rice and mango dessert.  The appearance was still and clear...there isnt variance enough in sake appearance to necessitate a scale of 5, but I must deal with the stupid crap Im dealt with.  Pretty clean and smooth on the tongue yet superbly thick mouthfeel.  Theres some sweet backing but nothing cloying, theres a funky bitter finish that could be a little less intrusive...the flavors in the middle are somewhat vegital like squash/pumpkin with a coating of licorice and medicine.  Its quite interesting really and a departure from the overly fruit/melon/coconut nuances were used to, though there are subtle notes of such here as well.  I quite like it indeed.","San Diego, California, USA","DaSilky1"
864,"2009-03-13",3.6,"Very good sake.   Poured a nice yellowish-white hue.  Aroma had a good alcohol kick and some fruits and cucumber.

864,"2008-12-30",3.4,"Bottle. Slightly off-white tinge to this clear sake with very well etched legs. Sweet and very strong in alcohol, burning nose strong. Sweet fruits, coconut, vanilla, banana, almond and a touch of koji. Taste is nice and sweet with a burn that goes up to your olfactories. Notes of vanilla, honeysuckle and coconut. Burns quite a bit more than the last Genshu I had.  Not well balanced at all. Alcohol is not well hidden and it burns on every sip, but it is still good tasting. Very warming and syrupy.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

Nicely complex and marvelous.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
864,"2007-07-20",3.5,"Bottled thanks to Chuck!  Poured absolutely water clear with no bubbles present... lovely, very long legs to it.  Aroma was of lighter fruits (mango, pear, and coconut jump out at me).. some darker alcohol notes lurk beneath.  Flavor begins with pears, like the nose, opening into much warmer alcohol and milled rice notes.. finishing with sticky rice and some more fruit.. very smooth throughout, and not nearly as warm at the finish as expected.  Very low if any carbonation on the palate and moderately warm.  Left an enjoyable impression through the finish.  Very good stuff.  Thanks Chuck!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

Very easy to drink and quite nice.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
864,"2007-02-07",3.7,"Very pale yellow clear liquid. Very tall thin legs. Rice milk, glue, raw coconut, hazelnuts, maple sap, and over-ripe pears in the aromas. This is some clean stuff. Again coconut milk with a light wood sap hint. Finish has a mild vanilla twist. Strong, but not foreboding. Quite relaxing and mellow, in an odd sort of way. Somewhat plastic resin resin linger. I like, in a strange way.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
864,"2005-12-28",3.6,"A faint haze, like a clear day after a strorm in a spacious area. Faint egg-shell white, not quite pure clear.  Nice oily legs. The nose is full, rich and complex. Sweet fruits, light paper, some alcohol, lightly minerally, not earthy but lightly dusty; clean and herbal with just a touch of koji. The flavor has a strong thick bite; lightly earthy and strong with some alcohol; earthy. The finish isnt very lively but it is buttery with plenty of umami. Distinctively American, not in the fact that its brash, but just that theres hardly any American kuras so you can learn the house flavor of all of them very easily. Good considering the alcohol. I want to use some japanese terms to describe this to get a better feel for them: Fukurami ga ii, Marumi ga aru, Omoi.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
