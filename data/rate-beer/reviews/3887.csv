3887,"2017-06-19",4.0,"Can (473 ml), shared by JulienHuxley. Cloudy-milky with a small white head, moderate retention, leaving little lacing. Aroma is of dank hops, fruity hops, herbal notes and mild spiciness. Taste is dank, fruity and herbal with mild spicy notes and piney notes. Medium-light body. Moderate carbonation. Dank finish. Easy drinking, nice dankness, light and quenching.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
3887,"2017-06-16",4.2,"Pours a very hazy, light yellow, not unlike peach juice. Minimal, quickly dissipating head. Aroma includes citrus and tropical fruits. Flavor is marked by a definite citrus character, along with pine/spruce hoppiness. Soft mouthfeel with a rather bitter finish. The usual high-standard IPA from these guys.","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"
3887,"2017-06-09",4.4,"Can. Milky bright orange pour with little head. Aroma is super juicy, dank, oniony hop juice, delicious. Taste is juicy, super dank. Palate is med bodied, creamy, low carb. Delicious.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
3887,"2017-06-05",4.4,"Poured from can dated 5/25/17 thanks AirforceHops hazy grapefruit juice with with a thin head. Aromas of mango peach apricot pale.malt and grape. Taste is amazing and a juice bomb well balanced in all aspects. No flaws nice mouthfeel and texture. I could drink this all the time.","Middleton, Massachusetts, USA","Chalumeaux"
3887,"2017-06-04",4.5,"16 oz. can. Purchased at Canton Location. Bright murky yellow in appearance with suspended particles in the liquid. I let this sit on my kitchen table a tad before I started drinking. Aroma is a mega ton of apricot, peach and light mango. 
The flavor shows me just as much fruit as the aroma shows. The addition of massive white grape and pale malt. The juicy character is insane. Just as good if not better than the base Stillings St. Bitterness is low, juicy texture that turns into a dry finish. Nice soft mouthfeel (that I expect from this Brewer). Everything I look for in a New England IPA? And quite honestly one of the best ones Ive had from this Brewer. (Or any other place for that matter) This is my favorite beer so far in 2017.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3887,"2017-06-03",4.0,"can shared poured almost a grapefruit juice color cloudy with nice white head and well the aroma was grapefruit deluxe...I could have been happy just sniffing the glass. the flavor though came through nice and hoppy and grapefruit citrus flavor medium body. very well balanced and delicious.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","tmongoose"
3887,"2017-05-30",3.9,"Canned 05/17. Pours hazy yellow, white head. Aroma is mango, papaya, orange, dank, herbal and spicy, sort of a resinous quality, but a pronounced spice character. Honeydew is quite prominent too. Flavor is spice, orange, pineapple, grapefruit, pine, honeydew. Dry finish. Solid. Quite a bitter piney finish. A little overly effervescent for me but still quite good.","New York, USA","SG111"
3887,"2017-05-08",4.1,"Canned 3/28, drunk 4/1 and on draught at Worden Hall, 4/19 and Lulus 4/23/17.Missed the first batch (early February, I think), so I was glad they released another pretty shortly thereafter. Heavily hazy, bordering on soupy, pale, flaxen-gold body is topped by a large, white head showing moderately-strong retention.Very understated nose, yet theres no lack of white grape, limestone, leafy, spicy, green, dank character and of course, a good dose of juicy, tropical fruits (though Nelson is much lighter/less intense in this aspect). Bare cracker and biscuit malts behind do not interrupt the hops at all and this one, unlike the last few batches of the regular Stillings, doesnt seem to have any of the heavy, heavy cherry-alcohol ester (for lack of a better description). What it does have, is a very easygoing, dry character that takes a good deal of warming and breathing to really emerge. If you just crack a can of this out of the fridge and start drinking, youre going to completely miss what this beer (this hop, really) is all about.Dry, of course, in the mouth, but nonetheless juicy, with pineapple, nectarine and white grape, as well as light honey and cracker from the malt helping to balance and add texture. Soft wheat and malt sugars with a tight carbonation help it go down smoothly and crisply. Tons of mineral character, white wine and even a touch of passion fruit-like character. Low on bitterness, no resin, alcohol or flaw. Nothing may ever be as good as the aroma on the first batch of the regular Stillings, but this one is a close second as far as the other batches of Stillings and DDH Stillings that Ive had.Also of note, this was considerably better three weeks later on draught than it was freshly canned.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3887,"2017-05-04",4.1,"Can, by way of a trade. Super hazy, slightly murky, dark orange colour. Thin, bubbly, off white head. Nose has a load of mango and passion fruit. Creamy malts. Citric rind and zest. Some stone fruit. Some woody mint. Taste is zesty and pithy, citric bitter. A little earthy and dry. Really lively and crisp on the palate. Sharp citric twang. Finishes long, clean, zesty and pithy bitter. Great stuff. Fairly low on the juice, but its crisp, and clean as a whistle.","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"
3887,"2017-04-21",3.8,"Can. Pours cloudy yellow-orange, medium off-white head, dissipates to a ring with decent lacing. Aroma is melons, limes, grass, pineappple. Flavor is light sweet, light plus bitter, grassy, a hint of dank perfume. Medium body, soft mouthfeel. Nice, but not the best of Trilliums offerings","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
3887,"2017-04-21",3.9,"Can from CBC Belmont. Opaque pinkish orange with head that fizzes away quickly. Dank mango and orange grapefruit aroma with raw dough and spice. Orange toffee doughy mango pineapple medium light sweetness. Light citrus bitterness in fairly dry fruity finish. Medium light extremely doughy body low carbo since a lot fizzed away with the head. Nice flavor if you like orange/grapefruit juice, which I do. Im still not sold on the whole fully opaque doughy IPA.","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
3887,"2017-04-19",4.1,"A humbly amazing New England DIPA, exhibiting flavors of brittled German lavender, butter lettuce, white grapiness, guava zest, just-ripe tangerine peels, poppy seeds, wheat germ, and corn stalks.  Ends florally; spearmint, elderflowers, cotton, and minerally-apparent cucumber water highly vocal upon its everlasting finish.  So far my favorite Trillium street-based street IPA.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
3887,"2017-04-13",3.8,"fresh can. Extremely murky faint yellow. Aroma has tropical fruits galore, some stone fruit, onion notes.

3887,"2017-04-09",4.0,"Very cloudy, pale yellow, light white head. Slightly sweet lemon citrus nose, some fruitiness. Pine. Zippy bitterness. Dry. Light body, long finish. Quite effervescent. Lightly oily. Great.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","markducommun"
3887,"2017-04-07",4.1,"Ah! In all fairness this can is three months old but hanging out in the back of the fridge the while time. Alas. A rating today would deem a fresh can for revision. Here goes though...What a hazy golden appearance with white foam and some lacing. Nice!
Aroma of melon and grape. Thats not much though but considering I let this one tarry too long...
Soft, creamy, luscious full bodied mouthfeel. Enjoyable experience.

It was a substitute for a DDH Fort Point 
and Im glad it made it from Beantown.

3887,"2017-02-02",3.3,"Can thanks to Homer321, thanks Sean! Pours the requisite? hazy orange with next to no head. Aroma is grassy and mildly citrus. Taste is muted grass and hop pellets that have molded. Meh, but not horrible.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"
3887,"2017-01-31",4.1,"16 oz. can from Homer321 - thanks again, Sean! Pours a super hazy dull fruit juice color with a small white head that settles into a ring and thin island of film, while leaving some light trailing lace in the glass. Yeah, its juicy, with citrus, pineapple, melon, fresh herbs - like hop pellets in the aroma with all the juice - along with lemongrass, pale and sweet bready malts. Light-medium bodied, with a bitter, zesty, somewhat fruity mouthfeel - albeit not as juicy as other hazy IPAs, which is fine - and minimal carbonation. Light bitterness lingers toward the front of the palate. A little drying on the palate, too. Another tasty, interesting IPA from these guys.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3887,"2017-01-23",4.2,"Can from Nate. Thanks! This one pours a cloudy yellow color with a whit head. The aroma has some noticeable dank and lighter notes of orange and passionfruit. The flavor follows suit with some nice herbal dank, lemon, lime and passionfruit. I kinda liked the duo of CTZ and Nelson in this one. A bit different than the other fruit bombs Ive had from these guys.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3887,"2017-01-22",4.0,"Can, ultra hazy golden orange with a medium head. Notes of tangerine, sweaty nelson funk, bright citrus, and overripe pineapple. Medium bodied with a cheesy dank finish. I would have thought Nelson and Columbus together would be too much on the herbal butthole scale, but this one wasnt too bad.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
3887,"2017-01-19",2.7,"Can from a trade. Nose is dank, zest, light butter. lots of hops for sure. murky, oatmeal, hazy dark yellow pour with a small white head. Taste is grapey and grassy and unbalanced. This has got to be one of the least pleasant beers I have had from trillium. Completely unbalanced and just a mess of hop grassiness and bordering astringency with no semblance of any bright hop flavor, just muddles ofmess.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
3887,"2017-01-19",4.5,"UPDATED: JAN 24, 2017 Hazy no see thru orange.
Just when I start to think a sameness is creeping in, and yet another Trillium IPA wont really be that good, they Nelson the shot out of one. Slightly more bitter and stanky than some of the juice bombs, but still juicy af! Orange and pineapple, like and bitter sweet tropical fruit. Awesome every sip!
2nd time even better - one of only a handful of IPAs I have at 4.5 out of well over a thousand.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
3887,"2017-01-10",3.7,"Pours hazy orange tinged gold into a snifter. Bright white head with medium retention recedes to hug rim leaving scant sheets. Orange, tangerine and mango aromas.
