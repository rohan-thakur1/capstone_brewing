1888,"2014-12-19",4.3,"I decree this an amazing British ale. Suffering from piney ipa overload this will go into high rotation. Caramel but without the sweetness.

1888,"2014-12-18",3.5,"473ml can from the brewery. Everything is English except the yeast. A nice flavourful session beer but lacks true English character that the yeast would bring.","Cambridge, Ontario, CANADA","barncatmatt"
1888,"2014-12-07",4.2,"On tap at the Arrow & Loon.

Appearance: Pours a medium brown with a bit of head.

Aroma: Mainly pine and the aroma is quite strong.

Flavours: Pine, grapefruit and other citrus.

Mouthfeel: Smooth with mild carbonation.

Overall: Being an English Pale Ale, I was expecting the hops to be more subdued in this one. However, they were really in your face. I really liked this one and found that it came across more like a full-fledged IPA than an English Pale Ale.","Ontario, CANADA","HopsandBolts"

Aroma has notes of bread and caramel, floral hops, and tropical fruits. 
Taste is a balanced bitter with solid floral and tropical notes and a mild, herbal aftertaste.
Low-medium body and, like most cask beers, a low carbonation. Clean and refreshing in the mouth.
Overall nice. Lots of fruity notes in both the aroma and taste. Not typical at all. Would get again to mix it up. Cheers!","Barrie, Ontario, CANADA","sudomorph"
1888,"2013-07-08",3.7,"2013/07/08 - Pours a cloudy, burnt orange colour, with a frothy, off whose head that reduces quickly, but laces nicely. Aroma is toasted malts, biscuit and citrus hops (lemon and grapefruit). Taste is toasted malts as caramel up front with a citrus, hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is medium sticky, with a good amount of carbonation and a finish that is somehow juicy and slightly bitter at the same time. Really enjoying the Tank Ten Series.

Smell is definite English hops, floral and slight fruit, that mixes well with a bit of roast malt. Palate is medium bodied with good carbonation.

Jan 26 2015 - second rating.  I forgot I tried this before and resisted buying it because it was an English Ale.  Probably was good but wouldnt be my first choice of style - I would expect that bready, caramel taste from that style.

The taste follows - weak, almost watery faintly sweet grain backbone, but mostly dry (as in dry-hopped?) leafy herbal bitterness up-front, no alcohol detected, mildly carbonated, but decent for cask, and a surprisingly long dry finish - Never hits in-your-face bitterness, but its probably more bitter than your average beer drinker would care for - me, I will have it again first chance I get - if I found a good pub in London (England) with this on, I would be a happy clam after endless rounds of sweet, faintly floral ESBs and bitters.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
