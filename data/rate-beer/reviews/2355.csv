Heavy aroma of malts, caramel, orange, pine, bread, hops and citrus.

Further scents of juicy navel orange, tangerine, and perhaps lychee fruit as well are perceived. This is a citrus explosion. The underlying malts mixed with the citrus hops throw off a bit of an iced tea vibe as well. The flavor is heavier on the malt than expected, with some sweet caramel coming through pretty strong that is coupled with a bready component that when combined is propelled into sweet roll harbor. After rolling out of sweet roll harbor the flavor turns hard to starboard and is awash in an orange juice wake. Post orange juice turns to resinous and tea-like hops that clean up the sweetness quite well. Could be a lingering prune note in the far finish. Mouthfeel is medium and carb is dialed in.

2355,"2014-01-03",3.7,"Tops Tempe bottle. Halloween beer in January thats no worse for the wear. Not sure where the exact dividing line is between amber ale and American strong ale but this must be straddling the line. Huge hop flavor that pairs well with the caramel malts. Strong resinous bitterness with a long finish. Very nice.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BelgianBeerGal"
2355,"2014-01-03",4.0,"650 mL bottle. The hazy brown colour is not so pretty, but it has a nice brown head to it.

2355,"2013-12-07",3.2,"I was a bit let down by this one. It is clearly similar to the Bloddy Valentine series; heavy bittering hops, big bittering character, with a strong malt backbone to match. Its just not as fragrant and its body feels less consistent than MBV. Hop flavor is rather flat, and uninteresting. Carbonation is standard for AleSmith, and everything else is just okay, but underneath the standard set by an otherwise exceptional brewery.","Loa Angeles, Alabama, USA","dansac"

2355,"2013-11-26",4.2,"Very dark burgundy pour. Some red highlights. Full khaki head. Juicy fruity hop aroma typical of Alesmiths hoppy beers. Cherry and seems to be the pineapple signature of citra, but Im not sure of that. Flavor is surprisingly balanced. First thing I actually notice is the silky smooth, lush palate. Malt is rich and complex. Straddles the line between chocolatey dark flavors and bright juicy red fruit. The finish is where the tropical fruit flavors are allowed to show up. Bitterness is quite mild, but balance is well maintained. Very tasty and enjoyable. I always feel like its cheating when an amber/red ale is overly hopped to the pointt that it doesnt really fit the style. This one has the malt to back it up and really feel like it should just be categorized as an American Strong Ale.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"

As drinkable as it is characterful, this cousin of Arrogant Bastard delights with its able juxtaposition of coniferous hoppiness and fruit jam-laced caramel, leading to a toasty and earthy second half.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam covers the deep red sheen.
-The mouthfeel is slender and cuddly, which helps drinkability greatly.
-The flavor profile is balanced.
-Alesmith can do no wrong, it seems.

2355,"2013-04-03",3.5,"UPDATED: NOV 12, 2016 October 2nd, 2014 - With Halloween around the corner its time for the Fall beers, typically ushered i with pumpkin ales and all kinds of other vegetal and spice ales. But Alesmith decorates differently, with a scary bottle and a spicy, tangy brew. The aroma is rusty, with a little bit of craft glue and cinnamon, all scents I associate heavily with preparation for the 31st. And, as if switching from preparation to Hallows Eve itself, the flavor has more chocolate, akin to the loot Id take home shortly before midnight at the end of this month. Theres a slight tang to it, and an earthiness rooted in cumin, giving both bright and bass-deep notes, covering a whole gamut of tastes. 

September 23rd, 2011 - I honestly cant remember the context or setting in which I tried AleSmiths Evil Dead Redemption, but I must have been hurried. My notes are short, curt, and actually, unsatisfying. According to my perfunctory and lazy scribblings, the tasting profile for this brew could be best summed up by referring to the ubiquitous Arrogant Bastard - a beer born just up the road in Escondido. That would imply that the Evil Dead Red is a fully flavored, hoppy and alcoholic brew that packs a wallop. I believe it. AleSmith never goes short on flavor, and if this brew is a clone of Arrogant Bastard, well, thats alright with me. (7/3/7/3/14/3.4)","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

The aroma picked up sweet, yet roasty caramel, nutty, and molasses notes, topped by a hefty dose of fruity hops and lesser pine & citrus.. just the faintest hint of peaty smoke too.. balance was spot-on.  The flavor found nutty and biscuity malts at the core, with additional layers of sweet caramel, vanilla, and molasses.. again the hop bill held up well, providing fruity and grainy earthy bitterness around.. some black peppery notes joined earthy bitterness and biscuity/nutty malts on the somewhat quick, dry finish.

Aroma is fairly hoppy with citrus and lemon notes, with sticky roasted caramel, touches of coffee and oak. A really nice aroma, but Im sure the hops shine through even more when fresh. Flavor is rich with toasted malts, deep caramel, fair amount of citrusy hops. Finish is mildly bitter but balanced with some residual sweetness. Palate is fairly thick.

2355,"2010-02-21",3.8,"A: The pour is what you would expect, a clear amber color with an emphasis on the red tones. A thin layer of off-white foam sits on top.

S: A great citrus aroma is the first thing I notice. A good amount of grapefruit and pine from the hops and a fairly well balanced amount of caramel and malt sweetness.

T: The taste is very similar to the nose. There is a nice citrus hop bite on the front, followed by a slight bit of caramel and toffee sweetness in the middle. The sip finishes with a rather pleasant bitterness.

M: Nothing spectacular in terms of body or carbonation, but certainly works well for the beer. Medium in body and carbonation.

It starts with a nice level of bitterness that gradually fades as the malt kicks in, though a little bitterness remains into the finish.  Ive already described this beer as ""earthy"" and somehow this makes it a great seasonal brew.  As with most all Alesmith beers, everything is balanced to near perfection here.

2355,"2005-06-17",3.8,"This beer has a frothy light tan head that sits atop a deep amber colored beer that is quite clear.  The aroma is fortifingly hoppy with notes of pine, grapefruit and a nice herbal note.  Oh yes this is packed with hops, bracingly bitter from the get go.  I get notes of orange peel in the finish as well.  There is some sweet malt here as well, but it is almost drowned out by the pure hoppiness of this beer.  The hops are quite refreshing though, after a night of hopless beer sampling.  This beer has lots of herbal hop notes to it, there is citrus character here as well, but it really is most evident in the finish once the malt sweetness is finally able to assert itself.  I get notes of candied orange in the finish, this beer is almost abusively bitter, yet it is still quite appetizing.  My only complaint, this beer could use a bit more malt complexity to stand up to the hop onslaught.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Now, to drink away...
Brash, fresh, tasty mouthfeel, soon subsiding, but a blast while it lasts. Dark fruit, and raw hops, again. Juicy cherry and berry, with a solid net of malt beneath, though not really felt through the flavor. About medium in body, with a soft, fruity finish. The appeal here, though, is all up front in this great buzz of tasty hoppiness that blazes across the palate. Not like any other red ale Ive encountered before, way tastier than any of them, more heavy on the hops than the malt...one of a kind, here, no surprise from Alesmith.

Great dark red, mahogany color.  thin brown head that disapears fairly swiftly.  very well balanced between the sweet malt and the hops.  these guys are hopheads but this time the hops are not so much for bittering as they are for flavoring and aroma.  another masterpiece!","San Diego, California, USA","akinm"

The beer as it sets in the glass a deep sanguineous color with a stupendous creamy light tan head that last for a week, well almost, the lace a thick and sticky sheet to obfuscate the glass. Nose is cotton candy like in sweetness, nice aroma of hops, clean and fresh to the senses, start is sweet, decent malt presence and the top middling in feel. Finish is strict in its acidity with the hops pleasantly spicy and the dry aftertaste lingers long on the palate.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
