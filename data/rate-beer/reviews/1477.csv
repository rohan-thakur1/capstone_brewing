1477,"2017-06-05",4.1,"Bottled 17-11-14. Thanks to wombat23. Pours dark brown from the bottle and leaves a thin, tan head that soon fades. Aroma is a non-traditional mix of soy sauce, cherry cough drop, light chocolate. Taste is bittersweet, turning dryer and slightly bitterer and a touch salty in the finish. A crazy mix of flavors - cherry, aniseed, soy sauce, Apfelschnaps. Body is medium rather than full, with a very soft carbonation. Finishes warm, but the alcohol remains hidden. Overall a unique beer. While it sometimes threatened to taste more like a medicine than a beer, it never actually took that last step. Absolutely deadly in quantity.

1477,"2017-04-16",4.6,"Qui dit de Molen, dit bière de qualité. Cette Tsarina Esra ne fait pas exception tant le travail sur le malt est exceptionnel pour une Imperial Porter sur la douceur avec un sucre bien présent qui en cache ses 11 % Abv et ses 93 dEBU. Malheureusement, celle-ci pêche par une effervescence très peu marquée pour un plaisir forcément atténué. Certains pourront être également décontenancés par une bière où tout est poussé quasi à lextrême, malt, alcool, sucre et amertume. Il ny a que peu de brasserie capable de tenir un équilibre ténu, et De Molen en fait parti. En verre cette incroyable bièreest dun noir total (EBC de 395), quasiment sans effervescence et donc sans aucune mousse à sa surface. Le nez, de façon déconcertante nest pas très intense, même sil présente une complexité intéressante alliant pruneaux, café, réglisse à des notes épicées et fraîche provenant du houblon. Lattaque, par contre, se porte demblée sur une intensité gustative très élevée avec une très belle alliance malt/houblon et des arômes principalement tournés vers le caramel et le chocolat,subtilement épicé (expression du Premiant, en complément du Sladek, plus doux). La deuxième bouche se tourne davantage sur le malt torréfié et des arômes de chocolat plus marqués auxquels viennent sajouter des notes fumées appréciables. Larrière bouche, sur le pruneau et la réglisse présente une amertume plus marquée. La corpulence est quant à elle excellente aidée notamment pas un sucre très présent, couvrant totalement lalcool à de 11 % Abv et lamertume, avec un ressenti moindre que les 93 dEBU affichés. Ainsi lamertume prenant place en troisième bouche nest pas saillante, mais plutôt en rondeur sur des notes épicées. On soriente alors sur un final, long, présentant des arômes de café aux accents épicées. Une bière donc incroyable, sur des expressions à la mesure de sa démesure.","FRANCE","jybi"

1477,"2017-01-17",4.0,"Bardzo ładnie wygląda Tsarina Esra. Piwo jest ciemnobrunatne, w szkle wręcz czarne, przy tym nieprzejrzyste. Piana jest beżowa, zbudowana z drobnych oczek, kremowa, długo się utrzymująca, ładnie zdobiąca ścianki szkła piękną koronką i pozostawiającą kożuszek na powierzchni. W aromacie pierwsze skrzypce gra kawa i gorzka czekolada, trufle, praliny czekoladowe, lekka nutka alkoholu, ale raczej szlachetnego, przyjemnego, coś jakby likierowa. Gdzieś w tle kręci się także nutka śliwkowa. Bardzo dobrze, choć jak dla mnie bez ""efektu wow!"". W smaku jednak ten efekt już jak najbardziej występuje! Od razu zwraca uwagę wyraźna paloność połączona z potężną czekoladowością, która objawia się mocą gorzkiej czekolady, która to dominuje to piwo. Jest bardzo słodko, przy tym nie ulepkowato. Na finiszu wjeżdża wyraźna, wysoka palono-ziołowa goryczka, która sprawia, że chce się brać kolejne łyki, przez co Tsarina Esra jest ekstremalnie pijalna jak na swe parametry. Alkohol, którego jest ponad 10%, jest bardzo dobrze ukryty, czuć go jedynie po lekkim rozgrzewaniu w przełyku. Niskie wysycenie przypomina o tym, że to jednak piwo degustacyjne, mimo że tak lekko wchodzi. Bardzo dobre piwo, De Molen znany z tego, że wie jak się zabrać za mocne piwa, pokazuje klasę i mimo, że piwo jest zaledwie 3 miesiące po rozlewie i ma jeszcze... 25 lat do upływu terminu ważności, to jest idealne do picia już teraz, zdecydowanie nie potrzebuje leżakowania.","Poznań, POLAND","p5ychol"

Piana: Nie jest zbyt wysoka, ale te dwa, trzy centymetry wystarczą w zupełności.
Szumowina ma kolor cappuccino i gęstą konsystencje.
Piana jest drobnooczkowa i pomimo, że nie jest czapowata pozostawia niezłe wąsy piwne. 
Zapach: WoW! Ależ ten zapach jest wielowymiarowy! Za każdym razem jak wącham to piwo czuje coś nowego.

Niesamowite piwo! <br/<

Wysycenie: Bliskie zera. 
Podsumowanie:  

Kolejna petarda od De Molena. Tak na prawdę uważam ich za jeden z najbardziej solidnych browarów w Europie. Nie piłem jeszcze nigdy złego ich piwa, ba nie piłem nawet przeciętnego!
Tsarina Esra jest Imperialnym Porterem.
Chociaż jak twierdzą piwowarowie to jest ich interpretacja mocniejszej wersji Porteru Bałtyckiego.
Porównywalne jest do Imperialnego Stouta, lecz bez palonych akcentów.

Carycy Esra niczego nie brakuje. Jest piwem kompletnym od A do Z w swoim stylu. Jedyną kosmetyczną poprawką mogłoby być nadanie mu większej pełni.
Poza tym zarówno smak, jak i aromat jest godny mistrzów.
Wyliczając bez końca niezliczone składowe skupię się tylko na kilku: czekolada, śliwki, czereśnie, toffi, cukier trzcinowy.
Alkohol doskonale schowany, lekkość i kremowość tworzą idealny obrazek.

Aroma:

Starts medium sweet with malts, caramel, dark fruit, liquorice and chocolate; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts, smoke and hops.

Deep dark brown coloured body with a touch of clear golden brown coming through the sides, all with a very thin, fast-dying tan head. Aroma of oak, vanilla, alcohol, roasted malt, earth, raisins and bunches of caramelised sugars and pit fruits. Full-bodied; Rich roasted malt flavours with pit fruits, earth, vanilla, bourbon and maple syrup noticeable - pungent and very well-rounded. Aftertaste shows a good robust malt flavour with some anise, nutmeg, earth, smoke and even a bit of pungent yeast flavours coupled with a solid sweet finish from the pit fruits and caramel - very nice, as expected.

Tömött, nehéz illatokkal mutatkozik be a pörkölés során előálló valamennyi létező aromával és egy masszív rumos kávés, vaníliás öntettel. Kissé átlátszó, kevésbé testes főzeteket idéző színe legnagyobb meglepetésünkre egy haraphatóan testes, krémesen lágy szénsavtartalommal megélénkített, fahordóban érlelt kávéturmix benyomását kelti, majd további képzavarokhoz alapot kínálva egy istállós jegyekkel megbolondított, túlsúlyos sour ale és feszes imperial stout házasságának gyümölcse kel életre. Ennyire izgalmas porterrel még nemigen találkoztam, bár ez esetben talán még kevésbé érzem sajátomnak a stout és a porter imperial jellegének megkülönböztetésére vonatkozó képességet. Egyszerre komor, sült húsos és egyéb szaftos-ételes, valamint likőrös, diófagylalt-szerű, alkoholos-tejkészítményes sörkülönlegesség, amiért igazán megéri pénzt áldozni.","HUNGARY","adster"

Complex, very liquorice-like onset with even some saltiness only adding more complexity, low carbo, very thick, resinous and oily mouthfeel, profound nutty, caramelly and chocolatey maltiness, dry spiciness, intense roasted bitterness in the finish with a smoky, tobacco-like quality, again that subtle saltiness, strong gin-like warming alcohol but nowhere astringent, very mouth-filling.  Great beer and exemplary for the imperial porter style certainly within Europe.

Heavy dark fruits with sharp vanilla, chocolate, liquorice as it warms. Some odd black cherry tones which work nicely.  Taste showcases the dark fruits, coats the palate in milk chocolate.

1477,"2013-04-06",3.8,"Pours black with some dark brown just barely showing on the edges. Small-ish mocha-colored head with lots of fine bubbles. Its actually a pretty decent head for the abv. The aroma has a lot of tasty milk chocolate but seems a bit simple otherwise. Theres a lactic edge with a whole bunch of cocoa, so basically milk chocolate. Theres a definite caramel malt backbone and a bit of fruitiness to the beer, but its buried in chocolate. A very light touch of booze. Theres probably a light mineral-ish hop flavor, as well, but its not easy to pick out. The taste is sweet, and while theres a bit more depth, the beer is still on the simple side here, as well. Lots of milk chocolate but a bit more malt and hop complexity, particularly in the finish. Its not quite roasty, but theres a darkly toasty malt flavor in there. The milk chocolate sweetness just doesnt relent, though. Mouthfeel is smooth and full. Very good. This is a nice beer, but I was hoping for more. I tried the recent Evil Twin stout and porter brewed at De Molen, and they were great. So, I guess I had my hopes up for this beer and a couple others.

smell: Roasted malts together with some sour dried red fruity malts. Dark caramel & chocolate sweetness. Coffee as well. 

taste: Quite amazing. First you get sweet & sour dried fruits, like black currant, vigs and plum. Then there is some sweet, smokey, dark caramel followed by roasted coffee flavors. Slightly bitter, but quite mellow for a proper porter. Then as a finish it all seems to come together. You still get the hint of sour, dark dried fruits, the sweet caramel and a bit of coffee. The coffee and caramel fade over time, leaving quite clearly the vigs/plum taste behind. Lovely. 

mouthfeel: delicious. Creamy, round and full, but with a proper carbonation kick.

overall: Im tending to give this one a 5 actually. But usually i only get there after i had a few. This is the one id go back to the brewery for so far, after bringing back a whole case of ""The Molen"" bears last time as tasters. Its quite alcohol heavy, but you dont get none of that when drinking (after maybe ;)). It has such a great flavor balance. I like porters, but most of the time they are just a touch off balance. Its too bitter, too milky or whatever. This one seems to do everything right. Highly advised!

EDIT: got some new ones last week, but somehow seems to taste quite different this time. Maybe its because they need longer cellar time, but these werent nearly as good.","NETHERLANDS","Xstream"

The aroma is very rich, with chocolate, leather; then some tobacco and very light phenol. The texture is rather oily, but the chocolate flavor is excellent, with moderate residual sweetness, some leather, some liquorice, and mild woody astringency in the end; quite bold bitterness too. With some carbonation, this beer must be splendid.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

The beer itself is nearly black with a tightly wound tan froth that exists mostly as a cap on top of the beer.

The aroma is not that appealing.  Dark chocolate, molasses, and some bitter coffee notes provide the nice part of the aroma, but licorice and earthy hops are less interesting, and there is a metallic copper smell that hovers above everything else.

The flavor is slightly better.  There are no noticeable metallic notes in the flavor, leaving dark chocolate, roasted malt, smoke molasses to provide a nice front, with licorice and a moderate earthy hop finish.  The flavor is a bit strange as well, and it is not something I really enjoyed.

The beer feels fine on my palate.  It is full, rich, chewy, and smooth, with a medium carbonation for the style.  It is a little bit dry and smoky up front, and the earthy hops, coffee, and licorice, provide a kind of acrid, dry bitterness.

The look: Black body topped by a very short-lived beige head.
In long: Nose is plain big fat dark malts with moderate roastiness.  Taste is grainy burnt malts, cocoa powder, burnt black cake, some tar notes, old coffee filter.  Nothing fruity in this beer.  The carbonation was a bit too relaxed but thats probably because of the age of the beer.  I wanted to drink it side-by-side with a bottle of the Reserva version and I probably waited a bit too long.  Finish is surprisingly dry with the roastiness and coffee notes taking over.

The Tsarina really doesnt stand out in the sea of typical roasted big black beers, it is generic but nonetheless enjoyable.  Glad I was able to try it.

The palate is soft and super easy to drink.  Id have never guess so high an ABV the alcohol fermented so cleanly.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"

Pouring virtually black and glossy at first glance, a backlight reveals a slight copperish sheen at the far edges.  A small outer ring of fat, clear bubbles outlined in brown is all that shows at the head.  Leaving behind a slight brown stain, a dense wash creeps down the glass, but leaves no lacing.  The nose indicates darkly roasted grain and concentrated chocolate syrup, with deeper reflections of burnt caramel, stewed raisins, molasses, and aged figs.  Theres a good amount of earthen hoppiness in there as well.  Flavors follow suit, again quite rich with dark chocolate, caramel, and molasses notes, yet sufficiently rounded out with burnt grain roast, bitter, earthen hops, and even a touch of espresso that emerges on the finish.  Lightly carbonated and slick, the palate sports ample heft, but some alcoholic heat seems to thin it out a bit, keeping it from being overly syrupy.  Damn good brew.

1477,"2010-07-01",4.4,"Well, I finaly get to try an old friend again, and this time I can actually rate it. This is a small 18cl bottle bottle 0591 of 1320 bottled 14th Jan 2009. So its got a good 18months of bottle age to it. Pours out nice and oily coating the glass like a slick as it goes, then suddenly, like the H%V 666 a tight mocha head pops up out of nowhere to create what can only be described as, a perfect picture of a beer. Solid black body with brown/red hues at the edge of the glass and a dense tan/beige-brown head satnding a finger high - great conditioning. The first aroma that hits me, oddly enough, is Cointreau - it has without a doubt an orange liqueur aroma to it, brandy, orange and chocolate. Its a strange attack of bitter and tart notes. Behind this lies barley, toasted malt, chocolate, coffee and rustique mellow yeast/bread branyard characteristics. The Flavour is spot on for me. Simply put, it is impecabely well balanced - it verges on being too good to be true, totaly poised from first sip to finish. First up is more of this crazy chocolate orange, folowed by great fruity hops, then theres some good mineral notes in the midal, which turn quickly to earth. Also in the mids, there is a curious, but very pleasant fleating lager element, probably created by the aromatics pf the Saaz hops, and a light caramel malt flavour that wafts around. Finish has an element of smokiness to it, seems at first to be a little abrupt, but then a subtle finish continues on with superb length ad growing intesity. All the way through this beer displays elegance and melowness in abundance, which is neatley balnced by a curious fruit tartness which creeps in from time to time to add balance and keep the beer from ever getting to cloying.

Vintage 2009 - Drank 2010.

A - Deep brown, not quite black. Small creamy beige head, that settles pretty fast with a bit of lacing left.

S - A lot of dark roasted malts and barley. A good amount of bittersweet chocolate, some coffee, and some dark fruit. Also a bit of molasses and brown sugar.

T - A lot of those dark, roasted malts are the initial flavor and provides a base for the drink. Some bitter roasted taste, chocolate, and coffee then come in, along with a bit of tobacco. Then dark fruit starts to make a greater presences (raisin and date) along with some molasses. Starts bitter and then eases into a bit more sweeter taste. Alcohol taste is present throughout.

M - Medium to full body that is creamy and a bit chewy. Low carbonation. Also fairly slick.

D - Strong flavors, high ABV, and low carbonation dont help the drinkability. I wouldnt mind drinking one at another time, but definitely not more than one in a night.

The beer pours pretty much visually flat, though it does muster a large bubbled ring of froth around the edges.  The beer is a tar black / concentrated brown color that is pretty darn opaque when held up to the light.  The nose smells of umami laden rich malt, hints of teraki, savory roasted grain, a touch of peanuts, toasted hazelnuts, toasted whole grain bread crust, espresso accented dark chocolate.  The finish sees a bit of alcohol warming that evokes thoughts of Bourbon.  Oxidation definitely is playing a rounding role here in the aroma, but it seems to only be contributing in positive ways up to this point.  It is really interesting how nutty the aroma is, this mixes quite well with the rich malt and roast grain notes.

My first sip sees me noticing that the beer is sweet, viscous, yet somehow thin due to the lack of carbonation.  This also has a touch of weird, almost rubbery, burnt vegetal note to the finish that is a bit distracting in my first sip.  Flavors of molasses, dark chocolate, and burnt brown sugar up front are followed by interesting leather notes, touches of tar, a bitterness from both burnt grain and hops.  In the far finish there is a touch of chalkiness, but the bitter roast grain husk flavors linger on the tongue without being overly astringent.  Some oxidation adds some burnt sherry notes, a background richness and roundness to the malt as well as a subtle nuttiness to the finish that in combination with some of the chocolate flavors makes me think a little bit of nutella (but without the aggressive hazelnut flavor).  Despite the light body (much of which is likely due to the lack of carbonation), this is most definitely a sipping brew and somehow it also has a thickness to it

An interesting beer that I could wish had a touch of light carbonation, but really still drinks pretty well without it.  I am not sure if this will actually make 25 years, but it has lasted the past two pretty well.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

1477,"2009-10-08",3.8,"330mL bottle, 2007 vintage #172, courtesy of fonefan poured into a tulip.

The top comes off with hardly a sound and an aggressive pour produces a smattering of big tan bubbles on top of an opaque deep brown body.  There is no retention or lacing to speak of.

The nose is boozier than I was expecting with a port character that comes out from the very beginning.  There are tons of dark roasted malts, coffee and bakers chocolate underneath the booze.  There is an interesting mix of tobacco and leather that comes out as it warms.

The taste really explodes with the first sip.  There is an ashy burnt malt and tobacco presence to start things off, but it gives way to some espresso and dark chocolate malts in the middle.  The finish gets slightly sweeter with some molasses before the big dry finish kicks in.

The mouthfeel is super slick aned smooth with almost non-existent carbonation.  The finish is ash-like in its dryness which I dont often get in a beer.

This is an excellent beer that I think would be absolutely world class if it had a shade more carbonation.  As it is, the look and feel take a hit from the complete lack of carbonation.  The nose and taste are exceptional with tons of complexity and all kinds of different flavors coming out.  Interesting and tasty.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

1477,"2008-04-12",3.2,"My Bottom Line:
The controlled sweetness of aniseed and vanilla swims in warming alcohol until an abrasive finishing bitterness provides plenty of roastiness and hoppiness for this atypical Baltic Porter.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A ring of foam barely surrounds the brown-sleeved black; even if I swirled the beer in the glass, it could not muster any decent head.
-The aroma was not really inviiting (nor intense); I really had to dig into it to find a few objects of interest.
-The mouthfeel is slick and rather loose, not helped by the nearly dormant carbonation.
-That spicy sweetness is almost minty at times.
-There arent too many residual sugars in here, which is nice, but I didnt find lots of mindblowing maltiness either. The body is rather slender for a beer this size.
-This tasted like it needed a lot more time to become more cohesive.

1477,"2008-04-06",4.2,"Bottle thanks to kramer17801. Aroma is a really intense, complex individual character. Theres an interesting depth that comes as unique, bready mature yeast character, but nothing bad. Its just so fragrant, delicate and nuanced. Mature, chocolately, bright and crisp. It has that extra edge of something I can explain that puts it in an upper echelon of unique quality. I think the high level of hopping contributes to the beauty of the aroma, but it melds really well. Pours a dense oily black, with very little head. Flavor continues in the vein of the nose. Theres some warm spiced bread, dark fruit jams, then a good run of chocolate and coffee. Immeadiately, Im reminded of Mikkeller X Imperial Stout, for having the faintest edge of funk. Dense, nutty and sweet. Im not overwhelmed by stickiness or alcohol, which makes this really special. Theres distinct fresh roast character that originates from Cashews, toasted breads, and caramel. Finishes clean and long drawing. I could sip this for hours. Dense and packed with flavor.

Charred and toasted grains in the finish.  Im not blown away, but overall its a really good beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"

1477,"2008-04-05",4.1,"12oz bottle, courtesy of kramer17801.  Thanks, Jason!  Pours an oily, dark chocolate color; solid viscosity; mostly headless.  Gorgeous aroma: oily peanuts, roasted malts, a touch of salt, and maple syrup in the aroma; all beautifully integrated; loads of roasted chocolate and salty/sweet oiliness.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: lots of oily peanuts, roasted / charred malts, and lots of dense, gooey chocolate; minimal carbonation; loads of dark chocolate, dried fruits, and chewy, oily peanuts; nice citrus and general bittering hops to balance things out; very oily, very full of chocolate; impressively dense, with very little alcohol showing through.  Lengthy finish, showing oily chocolate, cocoa, and plenty of nuts and peanuts; cocoa and dry toasted grains.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

1477,"2008-04-05",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2009 330ml bottle shared by kramer17801.  Pours a dark brown with little to no head.  Sticky sweet nose of motor oil, some smoke, some rich, sticky malt, a lack of overbearing hops, which is really nice.  Sticky, smooth, sweet, rich, decadent chocolate and syrupy malty goodness along with some moderately strong alcohol which adds to the whole experience.  Rich, sticky, sweet up front, drying into the finish.  Really well made, the sweetness thats found in most Dutch beer is certainly there, and it works really well.

Black color, not totally opaque, with no head and just a bit of brown foam. Strong aroma of dark chocolate, some espresso notes, a bit of licorice, a bit of hops and faint hints of alcohol. Flavor starts sweet with malt, chocolate, caramel and a bit of dark fruits and finishes with a strong hops and roasty bitterness. Full-bodied and syrupy, maybe even a bit like melted chocolate.

1477,"2008-03-30",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2016 Thanks Jan (from De Bierkoning) for hand delivering this Bottle #101. What an amazing porter; aroma was roasted malt with slight Smokey flavors, strong licorice, more alcohol aroma as it warmed.  I had plenty of frothy brown head after the initial pour. Taste was outstanding for this porter; full-bodied with plenty of bitter chocolate, coffee, slight tobacco flavor with an oily feel; very drinkable considering how high the alcohol level. Cant wait to get some more of this stuff!","Blacksburg, Virginia, USA","ygtbsm94"
1477,"2008-03-27",4.1,"12oz bottle #224 from kramer17801. Very lucky to get this without having to spend a fortune trading overseas.  High fill bottle.  No pop when the cap was removed.  I was told this leads to undercarbonation (as this beer was flat) in naturally carbonated beers, and also prevents mellowing with age, which would be desirable in this beer.  Pours thick and black with a heavy body.   Aroma is powerful despite the lack of carbonation.  Lots malty notes with figs and prunes abounding.  As strong as the aroma is, it pales in comparison to the first sip:  Like soaking a leather belt in pipe tobacco and prune juice, then chewing on the belt.  Flavors abound.  Actually pretty nice and fun to drink.  I wish the carbonation level was higher and it had another 6 months of age, or put into a barrel or something.  Mega-potential. 4.1-4.2.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"

1477,"2008-03-23",4.2,"Bottle #27.  Poured opaque black with a bronze edge and legs but no head.  The aroma is of roasted malt and bitter dark chocolate.  Notes of unsmoked cigar as well.  Roasted malt and more dark chocolate make up the flavor.  The choclate starts to  turn to a milk style toward the finish.  Bitterness on the dry finish.  Full creamy body.  Some chest warmth is provided.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
1477,"2008-03-23",4.3,"Appearance: Lazily pours out an opaque, inky black body. No amount of swirling, shaking, or verbal abuse can raise a bubble of carbonation from its depths.

Smell: Roasted malt aroma with notes of barley, bakers chocolate, and licorice liqueur. 

Taste: Richly roasty and certainly sweet. Hint of scorched grains. A taste reminiscient of bitter herbs and wood run loose amongst the other tastes of chocolate, licorice, molasses. A bit of smoke on the long bittersweet finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium body that takes on an oily feel due to the absence of carbonation.

Drinkability: All in all, it really is a fine beer.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
1477,"2008-03-22",4.3,"Bottle #40 thanks to jbrus via kramer17801:  Pours an opaque oily black with a thin ring of light tan bubbles.  Complex aroma of dark chocolate, mint, tobacco and earthy smoky peat.  Body starts fairly rich, but quite still, with a good amount of dark caramel and chocolate sweetness and a touch of light fruity ester complexity.  Has some peaty smoky flavor toward a slightly drier and warming bittersweet finish with lingering smoke and dark chocolate.  Leafy tobacco notes come through more as it warms.  Very complex throughout and would be great with a little more carbonation.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

1477,"2008-03-10",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2008 A Mes rate: Bottle thrust into my hands by a very generous Dutch bloke as I was leaving Zythos and I just couldnt wait and opened it on the train on the way back to Antwerp.Black colour with a short lived tan head. A huge slug of liquorice in the aroma with some damn fine sweet malt and heavy but lovely spice. Big but tolerable alcohol in the flavour with possibly the best liquorice flavours I have experienced in a beer. Thick chewy malt and not much of the 93.5 EBUs on show until a bit of bitterness towards the end. The finish has UNREAL length that just goes on and on and develops in an amazing fashion. It lingers for so long eventually maturing into some fresh unbrewed malt. Its like experiencing a growth of many differing vintages all in one go. This one is all about the finish and I love it.

Pours almost black with almost no head. Aroma is complex and powerful. Lots of coffee, roasted malts, light chocolate. Very low carbonation, making it very oily. Falvour is sweet, vinious, coffee, light smokiness. Fabolous aftertaste, where the 11 % come to the fore without ever being alcoholic - which is quite an achievement.

1477,"2008-02-04",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 30, 2008 On tap @ the brewery, Bottle @ Home. Aroma has roast, coffee, chocolate, some raisin. Black coloured with a huge creamy, beige-brown head. The bottled version had much less head and it had larger bubbles. Its taste is sweet with a strong bitterness working its way towards the finish. It has chocolate, coffee, licorice.  Very oily texture, much more like the scandinavian and american imperial stout brews. Very well balanced and smooth beer. But I guess it can use a little more complexity. The beer is still very young, and a little more aging will provide this complexity I think. To be rerated. 
Rerate, previous rating 4.1. Aroma is a mixture of dried fruits, some licorice, bitter chocolate and some wine. Taste is quite on the sweet side with a lingering coffee/chocolate bitterness. Thick mouthfeel, but a dry aftertaste. Good beer.","Baarn, NETHERLANDS","skortila"

1477,"2008-01-22",4.6,"Tap & bottle at the brewery. A wonderful beer with a brave plot which has been technically executed very well. Has the aroma of milk chocolate, a blend of varnish and liquors, raisins, vanilla and light cinnamon. Malty and yeasty aromas (dough) are light at first, yet get progressively stronger as the brew heats up. The malts are more intense in the bottled version. A jolt of coffee powder, cassis, cured leaves and dried twigs in the flavor  all oiled by varnish. Large, frothy luminescent-brown head. Too dense to leave any lace in the tap version: slips down the glass walls under its own weight. The lace is perfect in the bottled version. Feels pleasant oily, smooth. A slightly drying mouthfeel in the finish.","Den Bosch, NETHERLANDS","Savad"
1477,"2008-01-22",4.3,"UPDATED: JUL 24, 2009 Bottle. Almost black and opague. Intense aroma of chocolate, licorice, mocha and dried fruit. Full bodied, thick mouthfeel. Very intense malty flavor with pepper, licorice, plums, dried fruit, mocha and porto. The alcohol is there, but very well hidden. Already an excellent beer, that will need a lot of time to fully develop its total potential and reveal its full beauty. Like a teenage girl with her beauty still in the bud, that can do a 500 pounds leg press. A quite memorable beer.

Second batch, from tap: more chocolate and dried fruit, less licorice as the first batch. Immensely malty, amazingly good. The rating is fully deserved.
