1777,"2016-02-22",3.3,"2/19/16 Chicago ($5 16 oz draft pour into stein at Goose Island Clybourn Brew Pub). Dark brown clear pour, minimal carbonation and head. Minimal aroma. Hops and wheat taste, clean crisp easy drinking. Good offering.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","dukeandduke"
1777,"2014-08-28",3.2,"Draft Brewery Clybourn (Old Notes)-Pours amber with an off white head. Aroma of hops and malt. Taste of the same. This light bodied brew is well balanced and goes down smooth.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","Headbanger"
1777,"2012-04-02",3.4,"Draft at Clybourn. Pours a deep amber with an offwhite head. The nose is toasty and somewhat sweet, light caramel notes and some soft hopping. Kind of odd for a true Vienna. On tasting, the caramel sweetness just doesnt work for me. Toasty malts and again, soft hopping character but just not quite right. Without the caramel malt, this would be a much better beer. As it stands, just decent. Some mild astringency is also noted.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
1777,"2012-03-24",3.1,"Draught at Goose Island. Clear deep red/brown - white head. Sweetness. Roasted notes. Grassy. Nice malty. Hay. Straw. Light hoppy. Ok.","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Theis"
1777,"2012-03-15",3.3,"Flight on tap at the Clybourn brewpub (Chicago, IL). Pours a rich copper, deep reddish copper glow with a touch of faint haze. A frothy offwhite layer is smallish, laces ok overall. Aromas are biscuity and toffee, gentle toast and florals meet. A gentle hopping with sticky and spicy elements. Initial is medium bodied, a bit of girth, offering sweet toffee and biscuits, caramel. Bread, toast, touches of spice and a dry earthy hop character into the middle. A touch of dried fruit, orange. More dryness picks up, a decent dry hop, earthy elements linger with some sticky girthy malt qualities. An odd Vienna, a bit big, but tasty.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
1777,"2010-02-28",2.5,"Draft.  Pours an amber body with an off white head.  Sweet corny adjuncts with a light grain, and dry and light cereal grains.  Finish is like the powder from a box of cheerios soaked in newspaper.  Eh.","Exit 15W, New Jersey, USA","Rciesla"
1777,"2010-02-25",3.6,"Tap at BT for the GI event.  Pours a slight hazed amber - pretty dark almost woody- thinning off white head.  Aroma at first (when cold) is sharp crystal and harsh caramel malts upfront with some light herbal hops and vegetal notes, but as it warms, some nice biscuit and toasty malts come through with a more floral easy going hop note.  Flavor was similar- but as it warmed definitely gets nice biscuit toast, munich, and bready malts which were pretty nice, also get a slight fruitiness with some cherry skin and cherry juice and fruit look hints.  Starts off a bit questionable, but gets better as it warms.  Nice.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"
1777,"2009-08-22",3.2,"Bottle opened by WeeHeavySD.  Thanks!  Amber color.  Some vegetal aroma.  Easy to drink.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"
1777,"2009-06-01",2.5,"Bottle.  Pours clear amber with an average, frothy, off-white head, lasting with good lacing.  Aroma is average malt (hay, straw, cereal), light hop (grass), average yeast (sweat) with notes of sour apple, dust, and corn husk.  Light bodied, thin texture, average carbonation, and a metallic finish.  Average duration, light sweetness, acidity, and bitterness.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
1777,"2009-05-04",3.5,"750ml from chicagodori shared with wetherel and my girlfriend cyn.  Pours orange with a tan head.  Nose is sweet with floral notes.  Taste is sweet and crisp and all in all decent.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"

1777,"2009-02-04",3.5,"Working my way through the 20th anniversary collection. 750 bottle pours a dark amber with an off white head. Aroma is grainy with some citrus. Traste is slightly bready, good amount of caramel malts coming through. A slightly bitter hop finish.","St Louis, Missouri, USA","BrewCzar"
1777,"2008-04-27",3.5,"Still had this beer on tap...I ended up at the Goose Island Wrigley after going to DarkLord day so I was going on about 13 hours of drinking at this point (I did sneak a nap in).  Pours amber with a thin off white head.  Nice sweet malt with a balanced bitter finish.  It was a solid beer, kind of surprised that they only make it once a year, I could see it being a good one in a regular rotation.","","User29624"
1777,"2008-02-14",3.3,"Illinois (of which Chicago/Cook County is begrudgingly a part) is tauted as ""The Land of Lincoln,"" and so Goose Island brews this Vienna (didnt know it was Abes style) every February in honor of his brithday... and I wish him a happy one (if dead folk still celebrate such occasions) one day late.  ""Happy B-Day, Abraham! ""Not a bad lager, pouring a slightly hazed amber body with an ample head.  Doesnt last long.  It has an aroma of toasted grains accompanied by a caramel sweetness and a balancing earthy bitterness.  It tastes bready, still carrying the caramel, and has a smoothly intensifying floral/earthy bitterness that lingers long throughout the finish.  Not bad.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? Island - Clybourn, Chicago, IL<font size=-1>","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
1777,"2008-01-26",3.8,"Listed as Goose Island Lager on the menu, this was clearly a Vienna though. Pour was full amber, short of copper, off-white head, solid lacing. The aroma was bready caramel, some toasted notes. The flavor followed suit and finished with a nice light dryness, steering clear of the sticky sweetness that tends to hit this style. Very nicely done brew, GI the star of IL brewing.","","User37895"
1777,"2006-02-18",3.6,"Man, I was surprised at how hoppy this beer was.  Nice rounded and balance flavor typical of a great lager.  Full bodied, but drinkable.  Excellent beer.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"
1777,"2006-02-18",3.5,"well, one things for sure: its a goose island.  this was actually a very good beer.  i was surprised since i dont really associate goose island with lagers.  but it worked.  great with the beer nachos","chicago, Illinois, USA","sersdf"
1777,"2006-02-17",3.3,"On tap at GI Clybourn.  Poured a hazy auburn with a light off-white head.  Lightly-roasted caramel, toffee, and a hint of crisp fruit in the nose.  The same lightly-roasted caramel, toffee, and a light astringency in the flavor.  Medium-bodied and very smooth on the palate... well-balanced.  This was a tasty, easy-drinkin lager.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1777,"2005-03-06",3.7,"Slightly hazy amber body with red streaks and a fluffly, off-white head.  Clean, malty nose of caramel, toasted grains, grassy, earthy hops and a touch of oily nuts.  The body is smooth and moderate in heft, really enjoyable and thirst-quenching.  The flavors lean toward the malty side, with bits of crisp hops near the end to balance and keep from cloying.  The finish is elegant and smooth, long and satisfying.  I came into this session expecting the worst, but thats why I keep coming back to Goose Island:  just when you think youre getting a stinker, they make a solid, tasty beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
1777,"2005-02-25",3.2,"Draft at Clybourn: Coppery hue with a frothy white head and good lace. The aroma has notes of vanilla, caramel apple, buttered bread, aromatic hops, and a sublime hint of whipping cream. The taste starts a bit lactic and equally sweet with just a dash of crisp fruitness found under it all. I got some vanilla snap and malted milk ball undertone and a smooth subdued bitterness upon the finish. The taste was smooth, perhaps too much and it got a bit boring midway through the glass. Okay overall and didnt clash with my food.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
1777,"2005-02-23",3.4,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2006 Draught, Clybourn brewpub: clear, red-orange bronze; wisps of a white froth.  Moderate Saaz-esk hops blend with a deep malt backbone  refreshingly different.  Served extra cold, this one took some time to open up, but lightly toasted caramel malts are present throughout with a darker, slightly sour malt coming through in the end.  A nice go at the style, but Gooses cask conditioned ales are superior still...strangely enough this doesnt taste pretentious...hmmmm","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
1777,"2004-03-09",2.9,"Chicago Real Ale Fest draft inside the brewery.  This glass of beer contained a very small head of fine to medium sized off-white colored mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a good lace that quickly dissipated.  The body was uncarbonated transparent and brown colored.  The aroma was mildly malty with some brown beer notes.  The mouth feel was smooth and malty from start to finish.  The flavor was malty and very slightly bitter.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
