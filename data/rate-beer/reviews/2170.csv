The quality of this product varies a lot, depending not only on the batch quality, as it is exceptionally sensitive to at what point you drink it and how its been handled. The one Im having is really pea/asparagus- tainted, yeasty with some phenolic/bad alcohol vibes. Under that a really musty ripe banana, sweet malts, juniper. Its hard to rate something this volatile, but this is what I feel about this one. Ill probably average it out when I get a better sample to try.","FINLAND","jookos"

2170,"2013-03-06",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2016 Bottle from Alko Arkadia, Helsinki. Pours hazy brown with no head at all. The aroma is pretty unique among beers; it is full of overripe banana, spicy notes of juniper and sweet maltiness. Taste is heavily sweet with the flavours of banana, juniper and fudge appearing. Sweetness lingers until finish; no hoppy bitterness at all. The palate is medium to full bodied, low in carbonation and sticky. Alcohol warms but doesnt appear in the taste which makes this deceptively easy to drink. Sahti isnt the most complex of beers but definitely one of the most interesting  the antithesis of commercial bulk beers. This stronger version of Finlandia Sahti is the one I prefer.","Helsinki, FINLAND","Marstonlad"

Flavor is fine, obviously unpasteurized, sourish, with caramel and bread malt dominating along with tart yeast components. Very thick in body, you can actually chew it. Long, sourish yeasty finish.

2170,"2007-05-17",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 13, 2015 Draught (St. Urhos, Helsinki, Sahti Days 2007)
Classic Sahti, almost defining the style. Medium dark murky brown or caramel colour, completely flat, as expected. Huge wafts of bananas and malty goodness on the nose, all delivered to the tongue. Slightly oily, sharp junipery bittern details on a sticky toffee-sweet malt canvas. Better than the  weak 8% version. They are in fact the same brew, they are simply tapped off the brewing vessel at different points.

2170,"2006-10-03",3.7,"Check my rating of the 8% version. Iäm comparing this one to it. This one has a more distinct aroma, much more clear and strict.

2170,"2006-02-19",3.7,"750 ml bottle, shared by DarkElf - thanks for the opportunity on this one!  Pours murky dark amber with a thin white head.  Aroma of slightly underripe banana, honey, notes of spring flowers and maple, with a faint hint of turpentine.  Sweet, yet unripe fruit in the flavor, again with the greenish banana, sour apple, tart and tannic as well,  definite alcohol presence in the first sips, then faded into the background as it sat.  Medum body with some sediment and particulate matter, gentle carbonation.  Very interesting and complex brew.","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"
2170,"2006-02-08",3.5,"(750 ml bottle: Obtained in trade with bogdi1, thanks Juha!, and shared with SDbruboy) Ideally, I would have had a bottle of the regular Finlandia Sahti to do a side-by-side comparison, but alas, that couldnt be arranged.  But I do remember the near euphoria I experienced drinking the standard Sahti, and unfortunately, the Strong Sahti isnt quite measuring up.  The aroma is of green bananas and bubblegum, fairly sour but with a hint of sweetness.  But the flavor is very complex and quite a challenge for me to discern all that is going on here considering my limited exposure to these unusual flavors.  Green bananas again, lots of spice and bubblegum, quite fruity, moderately tart and citric, light sweetness in the background.  Theres a noticeable bitterness in the finish which I could do without, and though the alcohol is hidden for the most part, it is perceptible and a slight distraction for me with this style.  I dont want to taste alcohol, I want to just immerse myself in the glorious beverage that is Sahti.  The palate is light-medium in body, lightly carbonated, tart and acidic, and quite refreshing.  Plenty of sediment in the bottle, so the beer pours a dark, murky amber.  The small head is mostly just a sheen, but leaves spots of lace all over the glass.  Still quite an enjoyable treat, but I definitely like Finlandias standard Sahti better.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

2170,"2005-10-17",4.1,"At the LCRBM (Kulminator Antwerp). Very very hazy dirty soft orange coloured beer with small yellowish head. Smell of this very original beer is a little strange. It is lactic, it reminds to fresh youghurt flowers, it also has this fresh cheesy yeastyness and has hints of slight oxidized mash (purée) of stone fruit like apricots, peaches, bergamots and mirabels. All these items together have the smell of a baby who just puked up his fruit porridge (please dont get me wrong) this is not negative at all. The taste is super refreshing and perfect in balance (sweet and sour). It has this fine slight sweet malty caracter, it also has touches of cheesecake (kwarktaart) and the fruity aspect is just so vived and crisp. This beer has touches of mango chutny, renette apples, mild spices and the interior of a barn in the Alps. Great stuff, I guess im a Sahti fan !
