3516,"2017-03-06",2.9,"500ml bulkybuddel bb06/2017, ta BeardedAvenger. Mild Martha paired with mampf-minded Marieke. - ""Bottle conditioned"" seems to be a much more fickle creature in mild UK ales than in sturdy Belgians...this one seems to have turned intransit: where i suspect were lush, cushiony dark malts and prune-jammed dark bread, now the leavened brown bread in decomposition back on its way to sourdough and autumn foliage: reminded me a lot of Struise Rosse in fizzy disembodied mouthfeel and autumnal tartness. - Keeping this neutral rating, as it is within BB date, as a placeholder until another domestic sample or the cask version comes my way...","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"

Dark ruby red body with a good solid head of tan coloured foam on both half pint glasses.

Malty molasses rule the nose and taste: you can choose the flavours from caramel to toffee via chocolate and coffee with some peat bog notes thrown in for good measure. Interesting and a fine Mild to boot. The alcohol level is high for a Mild, which might have helped with the body depth and richness of flavours.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"

3516,"2011-10-29",4.0,"Deepest, darkest brown in the glass, nudging black, and opaque from the quickly dispersed yeast pack. Not much life on the pour, a thin, loose sudsy tan pad forms but is shortlived. The aroma is well pronounced; dusty, heavily earthy like damp topsoil with a lot of dark chocolate, Vegemite and treacle, and a hint of caramelised plums. Starts off sweet in the mouth with toffee and deep caramel, and a flavour reminiscent of chocolate icecream before drying out somewhat in the back. Thick with complex malt  there is burnt sugar, dust and smoke, twiggy bark and musty hop tones in and around the swallow keeping it from becoming sweetly biased. Nice length, very smooth finish has it all just linger in the mouth and aftertaste. Alcohol is evident, strange for a Mild, but compliments it well. Body is lighter than expected and it is very soft in the mouth, only a little evident spritziness of carbonation. This is a fantastic Mild, certainly has all the boxes ticked. Lovely stuff!

Very thin head, just enough big bubbles to cover half the surface. Very dark brown. Aroma of smoke, brown sugar and wood. Tastes like the scents. Woody sweetness upfront morphs into some strong smoke by the finish. Chewy. A Brown with some interesting light complexity.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"

3516,"2005-10-12",3.8,"Bottle
Roasted caramel, chocolate and berrylike aroma, fizzlesticks. Red chestnut, foamy lacing amber head - pretty.
Initially quite fizzy - need to beat the co2 out. Hereafter sweet honeyish, earthy/minerally and roasted coffee notes with a distinct fruity afterplay. Body feels light - probably due to carbonation.
Must be the most interresting mild to date :-)","Garching b. München, GERMANY","jonas"

3516,"2003-07-17",3.6,"Bottle conditioned. Almost jet black with odd glints of red/brown. Good but shortlived creamy beige head and moderate condition. Enticing roast barley and chocolate aromas, with a suggestion of coffee. Roast barley is more dominant than the choc in the mouth, and the coffee disappears, with a slight fruitiness developing. Finish is long and fruity with a hint of berries and chocolate powder.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
