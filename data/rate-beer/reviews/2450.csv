2450,"2016-09-06",4.1,"Tasting at Matts, vintage 2011, 9% ABVGolden color. Had it side to side with their regular Ice Cider, this has more class and elegance; it has a good flavor of caramelized apples, higher acidity, and nice astringency in the end. Very good.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

2450,"2016-01-21",4.1,"375mL bottle, pours a hazy dull bronze with a tiny white head. Aroma is much more complex than the regular, with caramel apples, treacle toffee, and brown sugar. Flavour is along the same lines, with caramel apples, treacle toffee, and medium sweetness. Complex and wonderfully decadent. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

2450,"2015-12-07",3.9,"Un liquide doré, lumineux et dégoulinant. Un nez de pommes mûres, acides et cuites avec des effluves florales ensuite. Un goût acide et sucré où la pommes se manifeste dune façon ou dune autre. Une texture soyeuse qui laisse un arrière-goût suret sur la langue. Quelque chose qui semble poivré au détour dune gorgée. Récolte 2011 Version à 9% (1674-061215)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","AlainG"
2450,"2015-11-29",3.9,"2015-11-20. Crisp dark golden yellow/amber body is effectively headless, light syrupy legs. 3+ Aroma has fruity apple character, very lightly earthy. Flavour is quite sweet up front, very light acidity, light undertones of apple skins/seeds pop up in the finish and aftertaste but dont linger. Fruity apple throughout. smooth full bodied palate, no carbonation. 3+ Less robust than some other ice ciders but quite tasty nonetheless. 7/4/8/4/16-17 Bottle purchased at Mondial de Cidre 2015, Montreal.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
2450,"2015-11-08",4.0,"Recolte 2011 375ml bottle. Thanks to ineedbeer. The cider is a deeper amber color than the regular version but still a fairly light amber color. Its clear and has no bubbles. Looks to have some body to it. Pretty alright legs on the glass when you swirl it. Compared to the regular version, the Reserve has more of that caramel apple pie flavor. Its sweet but theres more depth to the sweetness. Apple goodness on top of brown sugar, toffee, vanilla. Taste is still quite sweet but again I get more depth, more caramel, more rich, buttery pie flavor. Long, full finish. The regular version washes out a bit in the end, while this maintains its depth and complexity. Full, round body. Good stuff.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
2450,"2015-11-08",4.1,"Poured from a 2011 harvest bottle courtesy of tom10101. Aroma has a nice rich apple note with a large caramel and honey character. Some spice as well as light oak. Like an apple pie. Pours a clear, brilliant gold with no head or lacing. Moderately long legs. Flavor is moderately sweet with a nice, rich apple note. Caramel, candi sugar and honey also present. Some light spice notes with lingering apple and caramel. Light oak notes. A much better finish than the regular version. Mouthfeel is nice and silky with a bit of stickiness on the lips. Low astringnecy and low alcohol warmth. Overall, this is much better than the regular version. Richer apple and sugar notes add a more depth. A bit fuller mouthfeel as well.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
2450,"2015-09-10",3.8,"Pours a clear light copper with some really thin legs. Nose is of slightly brown apples, oak and light alcohol. Taste is moderately sweet with a good sharp acidity. Almost feels citric at times. Apples of course, but also some brown sugar. Body is medium and mouthfeel a little juicier and light than your usual ice cider. Sticky on the lips. Pretty good but maybe lacking a little ""oomph!"" for me to be considered great.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"
2450,"2015-08-27",4.1,"Sample. Clear copper coloured pour. Aroma of rich caramelized apple, fried fruits, nice apple pie spiciness, light oak. Taste is rich, nice and sweet, lots of caramelized notes, light spice, quite desserty and warming. Palate is rich, nice full body. Tasty stuff.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
2450,"2015-08-12",3.6,"Belle robe cuivrée. Longues jambes. Arômes: chêne toasté, fleurs dalcool, pommes un peu perdues.

2450,"2015-08-11",4.3,"sample. clear bright burnt orange with some sexy legs. baked buttery apple pie, lots of spices - cinnamon, nutmeg, usual suspects; wood; calvados, brandy-like red fruitiness - raspberries, wild berry jam, sweet red apples - hint of acidity. flat carbonation, medium to full body - oily and syrupy; sweet and woody-spicy finish. totally different than unoaked version - both as singular and enjoyed them as much for their qualities.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","czar"
2450,"2015-08-04",3.9,"How: 2 oz sample from bottle (375 ml) at home. 2010 vintage. Side by side with the 2012 vintage of their regular ice cider. 

>>> A tasty ice cider with nice oak features, but lacking a bit of depth to be among ""la crème de la crème"". 

+  Amber color leaving nice legs on the glass 
+  Theres nice oak features, especially in the taste that combine pretty well with the spiciness 
+  Its not too heavy for an oak aged ice cider 
−  It doesnt have the depth of the best oak aged ice ciders or the brightness of some ciders like the Cidre de Glace 2012 from the same cidery 
−  The tropical fruits present in their Cidre de Glace 2012 are there a bit in this one too, but subdued 
○  Its more oak forward than La Face Caché Neige Réserve, which is probably the most known oak aged ice cider.

Flavors:  Brown sugar, moderate spiciness, wood, apples, tropical fruits (mild)","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
2450,"2014-02-19",4.0,"Bottle sampled at Mondial 2014 with Linh, Minh and Angela. Pours a deep amber body. Aroma is sweet apple, light cinnamon, rich caramel and honey. Mouthfeel is a bit richer than the standard ice cider offering from Coteau Rougemont. Additional notes of caramel and very faint maple. Great.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
2450,"2012-02-14",3.7,"Pouring at the Mondial.  Pours a clear gold.  Caramel on the nose.  A touch empty, spicy and warm.  Caramel and sugared apples.  Apple juice on the finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
