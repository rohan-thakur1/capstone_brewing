The modest aroma offers up tropical fruity hop notes, apricot and ripe red apple.

825,"2013-04-18",3.0,"Hazy, medium amber body with a frothy, off-white head with average lifetime, ok lacing. Strong and sweet aroma with very overripe tropical fruits, almost fermented fruits, mainly grapefruit and pineapple. It lacks the crispiness and freshness that a pilsener should have, this is too overly sweet and too overripe fruity. The taste is moderate sweet and moderate to heavy bitter. The very overripe fruits dominate the moderate flavours, the tropical feel is a bit reduced compared to the aroma, the flavour is mostly overripe grapefruit. I definitely disagree with the commercial description of this one, this is not crisp at all! The body is medium to full, the texture is oily and the carbonation is too soft. The alcohol is not very well integrated. Despite all my complaints its a tasty brew, especially if you dont mind fermented fruits.

825,"2012-10-17",3.6,"12 oz. bottle, pours a hazy golden orange with a medium white head. Aroma of citrusy, grassy hops, some very feint hints of the kiwi, and some bready / cereal malt backing. Flavour is very hoppy, with a fantastic bite of grassy hops, some citrus, some dry bready malt backing but very restrained - pretty much no hint of the kiwi. Very hoppy bite that dominates this impie pils. Almost difficult to drink due to the intense hoppy bite that is a bit rough, but very fun to drink and enjoyable.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

Aroma is mainly hoppy, smells a lot like kiwi, grapefruit and orange, very fresh and zesty, a bit of basic malts, a small alcohol presence, high gravity lager feel to it, which isn't favorable to my superior palate. Taste is very similar, lots of hoppiness, kiwi and citrus feeling and the alcohol is never too far away. Tasty, but make this with american ale yeast, and you have a lovely IPA, which is what this beer is achin' to be.","Copenhagen (formerly Aalborg), DENMARK","phredrik"
