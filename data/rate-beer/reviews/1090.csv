1090,"2012-07-06",3.8,"Cask at Magpie & Crown, London. Pours a hazy, grapefruit pink with a faint cream. Tangy, almost sour pear nose. Flavor is medium to big sweet, fairly tangy with lots of residual, straight sugar and ripe pears. Medium bodied with fine carbonation. Sweet, sticky finish with plenty more tangy pear and heavy sugars. Its a very sweet perry, but this tangy, borderline sour edge cuts into it just barely enough to make it more palatable. This beverage is quite full of character. I like it.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

1090,"2011-10-26",3.1,"Bottle at Fin & Lozs tasting with Jan, Charlotte, Craig, Stella & kids consumed Saturday 22.10.11 I picked this up at the Hop Pocket, Bishops Frome, Herefordshire, summer 2011   This is essentially a watered down version of a standard Gwatkin perry (in my opinion) but it is better than expected even if some of the lovely juicy fruitiness and zappiness has now sadly departed, not bad and easy drinking.
