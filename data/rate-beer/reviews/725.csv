The aroma was rye and toffee. The vinous mouth feel was tingly at the start and at the finish with a lingering vinous aftertaste. The nice flavor contained notes of mild pepper toffee mild hops and rye. A decent one that I would consider drinking again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

725,"2015-10-13",3.5,"Bière dégustée en compagnie de Marco. Tout est étonnant dans cette bière, à débuter par cette mousse formée de gigantesques bulles (ressemblantes à du caviar de saumon mais blanches) situées sur les parois de mon verre. Au centre de la surface, rien. Très étrange. Nez on ne peut plus chargé et confus: du rye à la pelletée, des bonbons, une banane, de lalcool en bonne quantité et un semblant de cerise. Ça sent un amalgame dingrédients qui nont pas lhabitude de se côtoyer. En bouche le malt remet tous ces ingrédients à lordre et impose une discipline bienheureuse. Sinvitent à la fête une poignée dépices et de la baie de genièvre. Les saveurs et arômes sont tellement éparses et incongrues que je pourrais passer une journée entière à boire cette bière, si ce navait pas été de ses 10% qui auraient rapidement eu raison de moi. Non, impossible de se tanner de ces saveurs à la fois chaotiques et organisées. Nous avons tenté daccompagner cette bière de différentes bouchées. Avec de la pomme, une quantité importante de sel emplissait la bouche. Ça ne convenait pas. Avec des quartiers de tomates, nous étions cette fois en proie à un déluge dépices. Trop intense. Le haricot de saison neutralise la bière. Pour terminer, une cuillerée de miel. Avec ce dernier accompagnement, lensemble goûtait la cannelle. lexpérience aurait été très intéressante avec des baklavas que nous navions malheureusement pas sous la main.

725,"2015-04-26",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 19, 2016 I have two different tastings for this ale, separated by more than a year even though both bottles were bought at the same moment. So, the first one has the beer fresh and the second one has it cellared. Lets go. 1st TASTING (FRESH): Pours dark reddish brown, with rocky tan head.
Aroma is high: cedar, camphor, caramel, vanilla, honey.
Taste is incredibly bitter, unbalanced and harsh, with an aftertaste in which camphor obliterates everything else.
Maybe itll improve letting it rest in the bottle for a year or more, now is too aggressive. 2nd TASTING (CELLARED MORE THAN ONE YEAR): Pours reddish brown with sticky persistent grayish head. Intense aromas of resin, pine cone, raisins, chocolate, sandalwood, bilberry, hazelnut, smoke, prunes... Allow me to catch my breath and continue: scents of dates, figs, honey, pie, sweet orange, red apple, caramel, Lea & Perrins sauce... Loads and loads of different aromas. Taste is complex, balanced, displaying a nice acidity and a slightly bitter finish. Great. SUMMING UP: Not an ale to be drunk at once, but for patient people who would wait at least one year. I still think itd be even better if cellared longer, even more than two years. Maybe Ill find one in Kulminator next decade and then Ill tell you, because I have no more bottles in my cellar.","Madrid, SPAIN","huineman"

725,"2015-02-04",3.4,"750 mL bottle from the LCBO, served in a branded stem glass. Pours clear reddish amber with a moderate beige head that fades to a thin remnant and leaves a small amount of fine lace. The nose has big notes of pepper, bread, toffee and toasted malts, along with pine, grass and a touch of cedar. The flavour begins with a mild toffee sweetness up front with notes of bread and caramel. Through the middle, it acquires a subtle but growing piney hop bitterness with peppery notes. Cedar becomes more prominent towards the finish. Spicy rye is present throughout. The finish is long and peppery with a subtle woody quality. On the palate it is medium in body with a milky texture and average carbonation. Overall, an acceptable strong rye ale with an extra dose of complexity from the cedar. Unfortunately, the base beer is rather simple for the ABV and the rye is a bit too dominant. Matador 1.0 was miles ahead of this version, and the brewers would be well served to return to that formulation. 2015-02-04","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"
725,"2015-01-31",5.0,"Sublime. The rye and cedar commingle into a single beautiful note to support a perfect maltiness. Hallertauer is ever-so-gentle in the nose. The perfect winter warmer. My first ever 5 all around rating!","Canton, Yukon, CANADA","_Philomath"

725,"2015-01-22",3.3,"Bottle from the brewery. Dark amber pour with an almost non-existent head. Nose is toffee and rye with definite cedar backing. Lightly sweet with lots of spice. Medium full oily body with almost no carbonation (thinking this bottle has gone flat) With the lack of carbonation and the high alcohol content this is more like a rye whiskey than a beer.","Newmarket, Ontario, CANADA","jksipa"
725,"2015-01-15",4.0,"Pour: a very dark brown/amber but still very clear and clean looking, had about 2 fingers of THICK white head that dissipated slowly.


Smell: Has a sweet butterscotch/caramel smell with a hint of wood almost exactly like the smell of the inside of a cigar box. 

Taste: A very sweet blast of a slightly bitter smokey maple butterscotch/ flavor with a smooth woody aftertaste, can definitely taste the cloves and a hint of vanilla. 

Thoughts: The first thing I thought of when I tasted this was of a maple ice wine I enjoy it is VERY sweet tasting beer with a very unique flavor for a beer Ive not tasted anywhere else, however I found I really only enjoyed the first half of the glass because it was so sweet I almost didnt want to finish it. Most definitely not a beer you would want to get drunk from but like a sweet ice wine I think it would be a very nice desert beer served in a MUCH smaller portion. 

Endorsement: I would recommend to a friend but would recommend to split the bottle between two or possibly even three people, very much too sweet to drink 750ml of.","","zeruulln"

725,"2014-07-14",3.8,"(On tap at Brydens, July 12 2014) Pours a very hazy dark copper with a thick whitish head that lingered with lace. Aroma has lots of fresh cut cedar plank, pepper, sweet toffee, dried red fruit and just a little bit of rye spice. On the palate its quite sweet with toffee and molasses, lots of fresh cedar which together with the rye gives an earthy, foresty character. Peppery and a little herbal with some fruity notes. The wood is particularly persistent in the finish alongside the sweet core, and theres a bit of bitterness and alcohol heat which do serve to dry the beer out and give a bit of hop character to match that earthy, peppery wood. Medium-full bodied with soft carb and a reasonably restrained alcohol heat. I thought this was a bit too sweet for me, and the cedar is interesting but still quite bright. The stronger hop character of the first Matador kept it in check more than in this one. Perhaps this needs to be treated more like a barley wine and aged for a bit to dry out and integrate? I thought it was good, but not mind-blowing, as rich as it is.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"
725,"2014-07-12",4.1,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 2/18/2014. Pours crystal clear reddish copper color with a 2 finger dense light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big caramel, toast, molasses, brown sugar, brown bread, rye, cedar, vanilla, toffee, herbal, grass, light pepper, and toast/cedar earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/rye malt, earthy hops, and cedar wood notes; with good strength. Taste of big caramel, toast, molasses, brown sugar, brown bread, rye, cedar, vanilla, toffee, herbal, grass, light pepper, and toast/cedar earthiness. Slight earthy spice on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toast, molasses, brown sugar, brown bread, rye, cedar, vanilla, toffee, herbal, grass, light pepper, and toast/cedar earthiness on the finish for a while. Damn nice complexity and balance of dark/rye malt, earthy hops, and cedar wood flavors; with great robustness and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth and fairly slick/creamy mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is well hidden with only a slight warming present after the finish. Overall this is a great wood aged rye beer. All around great complexity and balance of dark/rye malt, cedar wood, and earthy hop flavors; and extremely smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

725,"2014-06-08",3.8,"Very deep dark brown pour with a persistent thin head. Some ruby coloured highlights. The nose is very peppery initially. Lots of cedar and peppery notes along with a bit of toffee and soft sweet molasses in addition to some soft fruity notes on the back. There are some dried fruit character along with a fairly intense sweetness. Its got some definite booziness and the cedar doesnt quite last through to the finish (although there is a touch of earthiness on the finish that helps to cut the sweetnesss a bit). The rye character is barely detectable but is there just as a suggestion adding some complexity to the cedar character. I think Id like to see it with some age on it to see if it could dry out a bit. Its actually a pretty pleasant brew - I much prefer this series of experiments over the cloying chocolate flavoured brews. Very intense.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

Tastes of caramel, toffee, molasses, with some very subtle hints of spicy pepper. More malty than I expected.
Overall the Flying Monkeys hit at least a triple if not a home run with this one. Solid craftsmanship, in this way above average craft brew. So glad I picked up 3 tall boxes at the Beer Store.
