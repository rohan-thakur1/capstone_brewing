96,"2017-03-11",3.2,"Tap at Brickhouse. Massive gingerbread pumpkin pie aroma. Some roasty chocolate tones underneath, smells like a pumpkin stout. Creamy, lifeless body, undercarbonated. Kind of a diabetes sugar bomb, quite overbearing for the ABV. The flavors are OK, just lack the body and depth of a great beer. Like a really poorly made Southern Tier beer, no offense to ST. So dependent on the barrel it is sad.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
96,"2017-02-10",4.1,"Bottle... This beer rocks!... Pours clear and black with ruby highlights and a small, creamy, mushroom-colored head. The aroma is a medley of winter spices, brownie brittle, brown sugar and caramel. Full-bodied and creamy with lazy carbonation. The flavor features sweet caramel, winter spices and bourbon without much booziness or alcohol heat. Loads of bourbon in the finish, but the alcohol is in no way overbearing. The delicious spices slowly fade. This world-class beer was shared with the south Florida crew by newcigarz!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

96,"2016-10-21",4.4,"Bottle. Dark brown pour, ring of lasting lacing/carbonation on the glass. Aroma is well balanced notes of cloves and cinnamon. Flavor also couldnt be balanced better; good meld of everything (plums, ginger, cloves) and finished with some good hints of bourbon and alcohol warmth (without being overpowering). Ginger generally ruins beer in my opinion, but it worked here without overshadowing everything else going on.

96,"2016-10-18",4.0,"Pours dark brown with a thin beige head. The aroma is potent, and dominated b pumpkin and cinnamon. I find nutmeg and a very healthy amount of vanilla, along with spices and cloves as well. Its different and interesting how this all fits together. The taste finds a heavy cinnamon and vanilla with some bourbon complimenting these. There is some maple syrup sweetness in here, minor pumpkin and spices, with some nutmeg rounding this one out. The aftertaste has long and lingering bourbon vanilla flavors. Medium bodied, with a kind of oily texture, and average in carbonation.

I notice its sitting darker in the glass more so than most pumpkin beers. A change for once, I think. A couple of bites of prime rib sets me right. I need some sugar to balance out the salt. Boozy, sweet coconut, brown sugar, molasses, cinnamon, nutmeg, and some gourd are all there. Im too confused by the nuances. Maybe this is a fitting beer for tonight; thick and syrupy beers are plaguing me these days. I sit back and I wonder if its all too much. I think it is.

96,"2015-12-06",4.4,"22 ounce bottle into tulip glass; no bottle dating, assumed to be a 2015 vintage. Pours clear nearly opaque very dark brown color with a 1 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of huge caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, vanilla, gingerbread, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, raisin, fig, apple, toasted oak, bourbon, coconut, light herbal, and oak/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, pumpkin spices, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, vanilla, gingerbread, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, raisin, fig, apple, toasted oak, bourbon, coconut, light herbal, and oak/toasted earthiness. Light bourbon/oak spiciness and earthy spice bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, vanilla, gingerbread, nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, raisin fig, apple, oak, bourbon, coconut, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, pumpkin spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/oak/spice balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly slick/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible barrel aged imperial spiced brown ale style. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/bready malt, pumpkin spices, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth and easy to sip on for the ABV. An insanely amazing offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

96,"2015-11-29",3.6,"650 ml bottle

Discovered a few months ago on a trip to Minneapolis and back, I grabbed this with few expectations. Thankfully it met them all and even managed to sneak in a few surprises. A robust seasonal that should be good well into the long winter, this release demonstrates why Central Waters is a strong contender in Wisconsins crowded brewing scene.

Aroma / Appearance - An inky murky black base retains a cream colored head that looks a bit like peeling birch. Vanilla, pumpkin spices, bourbon, and chocolate velvet cake lend the air of a Thanksgiving dessert table.

Flavor / Palate - The full bodied creaminess promises a rich texture that delivers from start to finish. Nutmeg, cinnamon, and earthy squash give the seasonal pumpkin aspects you come to expect. The finish of truffle and oak is less anticipated though no less enjoyable. This might be one of the best pumpkin seasonals that Ive tried from the state though I have yet to sample New Glarus attempt.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
96,"2015-11-27",3.6,"Bomber. A big golden brown head. Dark brown and opaque beer. First sniff is booze and big spices behind that. Bourbon and pumpkin. The foam finally settled enough to get a sip and that brings an extreme pumpkin beer. A lot of stuff is going on here. Bourbon, alcohol, wood, char, nutmeg, allspice, pumpkin, vanilla, etc. Some interesting fruit notes, too. Raisins, dates, etc. Toffee and cinnamon, too. This might try to do too much but it works pretty well. The feel is rich and just a little powdery.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"

Aroma of pumpkin spices, nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger, along with plenty of vanilla and some bourbon. The taste has well integrated flavors of cinnamon, nutmeg and a hint of ginger with some sweetness up front. Taste of vanilla softens the spice flavors and you also get coconut that fades into light bourbon and some wood and roast flavors in the aftertaste. Finishes dry with some roast and wood. Semi creamy mouthfeel with a medium/full body and medium/high carbonation. Enjoyed this more than I expected. Wonderful barrel character and the spices weren’t overpowering. Very well integrated flavors.

96,"2014-11-26",2.6,"(bottle) Pours black with a medium tan head. Thought this was going to be orange, so the color is a surprise. Aroma leads off with a spice bomb that is actually quite pleasant nosewise. I think the nutmegs taking center stage here, but its closely followed by cinnamon and clove, with the clove flaring above the fray from time to time. Ginger shows with some warming. Smells a lot like spiced applesauce with shades of masala chai. Pretty sure theres no pumpkin in this as Im not picking up that baked pumpkin vibe I normally get in beers brewed with pumpkin, but it certainly fits under the ubiquitous ""Pumpkin Spice"" banner in spades. Fruitwise, its more appley than anything. Flavor continues the apple vibe and approaches Jolly Rancher Green Apple territory. This is not a good place to be. Based on these scents and tastes, and given the fact that it feels like Ive placed Pop Rocks in my mouth after taking each sip (due to the vigorous carb), Id imagine this here beer is barreling (pun intended) down the road towards full-blown infection. Aside from this glaring flaw, theres a chocolate component which reminds me of Hersheys syrup, and the crap candy vibes in the flavor are one too many here. Stewed tomatoes.  Stone ground mustard. Could be shades of barrel, but its really hard to tell. Lingering spice/chocolate finish. Beyond spritzy carb. and a medium mouthfeel.

96,"2014-11-02",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 20, 2016 Dark brown with tannish head. A good bourbon and spiced aroma. Solid dark fruit, nutmeg, cinnamon, vanilla, raisin flavor. Full body. Pretty good fall beer ---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone 
Update 2016: continues to be a dependably amazing autumn beer year after year. I look forward to it now. Really complex, and just hits every note of fall you can think of. Maple, pumpkin, spices, the barrel aging is not over the top.and the sweetness is kept in check","Wisconsin, USA","akoeninger"
