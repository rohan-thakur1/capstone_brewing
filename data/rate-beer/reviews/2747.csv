Earthy nutty flavour to go with the hoppy blond beer.  Yes a kind of brazil nut quality to it.  Hops are fine.  Very good bitterness on the finish.  Good character.  Yes a very decent blond.  Not much Belgianness to it though I thought. Id happily have this again for the hoppy finish.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"

2747,"2012-04-10",3.8,"Smooth milky pouring with a lavish white bouffant of a head. Deep rooted hop chute manages to escape from the earthly yellow, almost mucky cream body. Tender hop zest squeezes onto an initial palate of light graininess with a cracker wheatbread in bite. Pasting of the Belgian cultivation follows but is cut short by an unripened fruit rind sook. Compelled to add I enjoyed this linger see-saw to the dregs. A really simple yet elegant beer with striking features where I want it most.

2747,"2012-03-19",3.7,"UPDATED: AUG 2, 2012 Bottle at the brewery. Thanks, Gary! A much better experience than the first time I tried this beer. The tang is gone, and theres a wonderful hop bite to the beer now. Many of the same, good characteristics are still here. Very well-made brew. (3.7)Bottle at home in London. Pours clear, pale yellow-gold, highly effervescent, with a creamy, white head. Aroma has some sugary dough, pale malt, straw. The flavor certainly is sharp, though not in a terribly good way. Theres an almost sour tinge to the flavor. Light sweet, some doughy malts, hay. Yeah, theres definitely something a little peculiar. Light to medium bodied with average carbonation. Crisp, biting finish with more of that tangy, lightly sour citrus, mild dough, faint straw bitterness. Yeah, not too impressed by this one; Im really hoping this tang is unintentional.

2747,"2012-02-19",3.8,"Not Redchurchs best work, but a decent take on a Belgian style.  Hazy light amber color.  Aroma is inviting, a bit earthy with some funky yeast.  The taste underperforms, there is a lack of bite in the hops and the watery finish is an unfortunate coda to the experience.  Still, better than average and a good beer for such a young brewery.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","ads135"
2747,"2012-02-16",3.5,"Bottle from Peoples Supermarket. Colour is hazy caramel amber. Nose is nice grainy husky barley malt, bit of yeast sourness, some dry hay grassy notes and touch of sweet caramel. Taste is malty, hop bitter ale which is not far from being a late or light saisonr, but has a hoppier maltier fuller flavoured taste. Finish has quite a sour/bitter bite like a saison.Balance between sweetness and bitterness is excellent on the finish. Interesting and nice. Body is medium and crisp but touch of oiliness.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","EdKing"
