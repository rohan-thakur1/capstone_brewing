Smells of spicy licorice, rustic bread, dried plums and bakers chocolate. This forms a very intriguing, well balanced and complex nose, relying on a rich, diverse maltiness. Honey and toasted hazelnuts, together with just a dry whiff complete the aromas in this, hinting to a well brewed, tasty beer.

Has a soft, vivid carbonation, showcasing a medium bodied beer, which puts its focus on the malts theoughout, while producing an amazing depth of flavors, soothed by a nice whipped cream fluffiness.

Tastes of milk chocolate, caramel, rustic bread crust, old pepper hulls, earth and marzipan. Awesomly complex, sweet but with an earthen balance to it, which makes it possible for the flavors to develop flawlessly, enriched by the soft carbonation, which lets the beer glide gently over the tongue. Licorice sets in after the swallow with a short Coca-Cola like sweet peak, immediately toned down by bakers chocolate, a prominent and sudden dryness and rustic bread. 
The finish provides another reference to the supersoft mouthfeel with a sparkly carbonation hint in it, gently complimenting to earth and toffee - rustic and well-rounded.

Awesome Bock - rustic, sweet, malty, earthy with an intriguing depth of flavors to it, which tend to benefit from each other the whole time. There is even a short, warming peak to be found, hinting to the bigger body of the beer and its purpose of being a very drinkable, unique winter warmer.","GERMANY","aleigator"

2468,"2016-02-19",4.0,"500ml bottle. No discernible date. Appearance: Deep brown with ruby red tint and a thick khaki head that lingers. 
Aroma: Raisin, cherry, fig, toasted bread, and a touch of alcohol. 
Taste: Rich malt sweetness, toasted bread prominent, with a strong dark fruit flavor reminiscent of plum and dark cherry. Moderate bitterness enough to balance the rich malt. 
Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy body with some creaminess for the style, moderate carbonation, and a hint of alcohol on the swallow. 
Finish: Toasted bread lingers long after the swallow with a touch of fruit. 
Overall: On the low end of a Doppelbock intensity scale, closer to a traditional bock in that respect. However, the rich dark fruit aroma in flavor more in line with Doppelbock. Either way, an outstanding beer. Complex aroma and flavor profile, balancing the toasted bread Munich malt character with well developed fruitiness of plums, cherries, and raisins.","","TH28"

2468,"2012-05-05",3.1,"Clear, dark brown body with a red tint, topped by a light-brown, creamy head that is short-lived and ends up as a thin film and some residue at the walls. The lightly roasted aroma is faint and not that exciting, although its pleasant enough. Caramel, dark bread and a vinous touch. There are also some almost rotten notes buried deep down in the mix. However, when put where its supposed to be, i.e. in my mouth, this beer is much more interesting! True to the style the taste is moderate to heavy sweet. A moderate to light bitterness makes sure that the beer never feels too cloyingly sweet. Dark, sweet caramel is the backbone of the flavour profile, also toasted notes, dark dried fruits and again this vinous feel. The body is medium to full and the texture is pleasantly oily with a fitting soft carbonation, but an ever-present and annoying metallic feel partially destroys the otherwise pleasant mouthfeel. A decent beer with nice flavours, but a bit uninspiring aroma and too much metal.

Pretty complex on just the malt alone: grainy, huge melanoidin, bready, munich malt richness, dark fruit, plums, figs, caramelization, raisins, and a hint of spice (hops?). Nothing else; very clean beer. Flavors are deep, rich melanoidin and lots of kettle caramelization. Flan, molasses, bready, grainy, brown sugar. Leans on the slightly sweet side, but very balanced. Rich, dark fruits, raisins and almonds. Still quite drinkable. Fresh and delicious! Slightly bitter balance if any leaning is found. Creamy mouthfeel, light carbonation. Some warming.

It pours a great color, a dark brownish0red with a huge fluffy tannish off-white head that sticks around and leaves some nice lacing.

The smell on this one is great, you can smell it from a long distance away. When you get up close to it you get a bready, roasty, carmally scent that just beckons you to chug. Fresh doppelbock just smells beautiful.

The flavor is right on. It is perhaps a bit roastier than most but that is what makes it unique. Big dark bready flavors meld with a caramel sweetness and a hint of bitterness.

Pours a dark ruby red/chestnut brown color with mahogany edges when held to a light and a two finger frothy, light beige head. Decent retention, slowly fading into a lasting ring that leaves sporadic spots of lacing behind.

Roasted malt aroma with hints of chocolate, hazelnut and toffee as well as some subtle spice and earthy hops. Slightly chalky smelling and the earthy hop presence balanced out the sweeter/roastier notes in the nose.

Medium bodied and fuller than expected with a good balance of bitter roasted malt and sweeter chocolate flavor. Dry and roasted up front with hints of dark chocolate, hazelnut, caramel and toffee. Theres also some faint hop bitterness that compliments the roasted character. Some nice bready yeast underneath adding to the body and a ton of chocolate sweetness make this beer very quaffable.

Great malt presence all around. The flavor ramps things up with a bit of extra sugar sweetness and strong, dark caramel. A bit of an earthy presence in the dry finish. Slight bit of dark fruits there as well. Good medium body with lower levels of carbonation. Quite drinkable.

2468,"2010-12-22",4.1,"500 ml, BB date reads 17.March2011, into tulip. Pours opaque yet clear dark brown body with ruby shining at the edges, overlain by creamy, beige head with good retention that clings to the walls. The nose is very rich malty sweetness with melanoidin-toasty qualities, strong fruitiness of plums, prunes and raisins brought by malts rather than yeast-derived esters, some caramel and noticeable alcohol penetrating through the thick malty body. Rich malt flavor with melanoidin-toasty character, caramel, dark fruits and roasty notes that, together with light hoppy bitterness, balance out the malty sweetness. There is is a distinctive spicy touch in both aroma and flavor profile, probably originating from the noble hops used. Medium to full bodied beer with moderate to fine carbonation, somewhat sticky, verging on being syrupy coats the lips with a film of sweet residues.

Candy sugar continues as you drink through the head but soon changes into lovely chocolatey malts, mixed with some treacle, cough mixture and liquorice.  A growing German grassy hop bitterness fails to sit well with the sweet rich initial flavours, and you realise why these hops helped a golden pilsener culture take off in Germany & Bohemia - they simply dont work as well with dark malts.

Very dark brown, with a good tan colored head. Aroma of strong roasted malt, with caramel and cookies. Tastes a bit sweet, but with good hop balance, caramel and a bit of coffee as well.

Gyönyörű sötét szín, finom hab, és visszafogottan dús szénsav. Az íze akár az illata. A várt nádcukros édesség keveredik a egy száraz füstösséggel.

A - Deep amber brown with some orange hues as well. Average sized, creamy and foamy light beige head that disappears fast and leaves little lacing left.

2468,"2009-09-13",3.8,"Bottle and served in snifter, next to Kaufbeuren Buronator Doppelbock, Allgäuer Cambonator Doppelbock, and Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock (the baseline bier):  App: All three had a mahogany hue with the Buroator and Asam bocks displaying a bit more reddish highlights as well as a darker more tannish creamy head and better lacing. Cambonator gets the lowest score of 3, the others 4 each.  Aroma: Buronator, heavy caramel malt, bready and alcohol, some prune and fig along with a touch of peaty like smoke, brilliant. The Cambonator displays a walnut tone long with caramel, brown sugar and grape juice, interesting. The Asam bock has the weakest nose of the three with notes of caramel, wood, tobacco, grains, and a hint of raisin.  Taste: Rich and sweet caramel malt is front and center as expected in all three biers as is a hint of molasses. The differences are found with the undertones: Buronator has a figgy and roasty tone along with a dash of mineral water. It seems despite the heavy malt to be the most balanced of the three. The Cambonator has a very slight acidity (again grape juice) and some ashy notes. The Asam has more of a bakers chocolate tone and is more earthy and tobacco like, the most complex of the three.  Mouthfeel: Buronator, creamy and lively, Cambonator, lively and oily, a bit thinner, Asam lush and heavy, dry mineral finish.  Overall: While all three are well done and similar in the basics, the difference of enjoyment and complexity gives Buronator a slight advantage over Asam Bock with the Allgauer Cambonator my least favorite. This is interesting since the Buronator has the lowest ratebeer score of the three. Now when compared to the standard bearer of the style, and Ayinger Celebrator Doppelbock ( 4.2), I found both the Buronator and Asam close companions but still a second cousin, The Cambonator was not even in the same zip code.  Ahhh, the wonders of the horizontal tasting.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
2468,"2009-09-10",4.0,"Poured from the bottle into a pint glass to drink.  The beer had a somewhat clear dark amber-brown color with a creamy-foamy light tan head, which had moderate retention and cling.  The beer had rich caramel malt aromas with floral and fruit aromas, some raisin and a bit of earthy hops.  The beer had a sweet fruity taste with a bit of grainy bitterness to complement it.  It was slightly creamy with average to light carbonation and a wet body with a good, clingy mouthfeel.  A high quality beer, very much enjoyed.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Derek881"

Pours a very dark, almost clear, red with a thick creamy light tan froth with some lacing, settlings into lovely super fine bubbles.  Aroma is super fruity, like a fruit-snack/gummy-bear, rich grainy malts, lots of malt flour, very light chocolate, touch of grass 6.5.  Mmmmm the flavor is wunderbar, endlessly malty, loads of grainy malt flour, some faint bitterness that adds dimension, bitter chocolate and malt flour, like drinking rye bread, fantastic 8.5.  Flavor brings huge nostalgia of when my grandfather used to make me chocolate malts as a kid.  It isnt rich but perfectly sweet.  Long lingering chalky bitterness. No hint of any alcohol, well just enough to warm the flavor.

Only a little disappointing in its lack of punch. Hints of dark fruits and nicely toasty bread. Flavor starts with a very rich toffee and sweet malts. Gains a very nice fruity edge that gives it a superb balance to the nutty and woody character. Finishes with a very rich and fulfilling character. Just tasted some walnut or almond fresh nut lingering. Really nice all around flavor from start to finish. Medium to full body and a rich carbonation.

The beer pours out a beautiful mahogany brown color, creamy 2"" thick light tan head.  The body looks almost purple if you stare at it long enough.

2468,"2009-04-04",3.9,"500ml bottle. BB 30 06 09.
Deep bronze body with ruby highlights. Thick tan head sits atop, leaving a spiderweb of lace in its wake.
Oxidised malt aroma, but not in a bad way. Toffee, mollasses, burnt nuts, cocoa, dried fruit, spice, over-cooked meat...if that makes sense!
Richly textured body, creamy carbonation, bit of dryness toward the finish yet a sweetness still remains.
The beer really opens up especially on the body. Plenty of big rich malt characters of toffee, chocolate and nut, yet nothing remotely roasty. Going further are complex notes of raisin, sultana, prune, smoke, wood, earthy spice, bread, subtle herbs. Finishes dry, with a slightly odd bitterness and lingering note of cocoa.
Yum, I do love a good bock. Such a simple and easy drinking beer on the surface, yet complexities seem to form on their own accord amongst the rich malt and alcohol. Lovely.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

2468,"2008-04-10",4.0,"16.9 ounce bottle.  This was a  new style for me, and a great introduction to it.  The pour delivered a beautiful brick red body surrounded by an orange aura and capped with a light tan head.  The body was clear and spots of light lacing clung to the glass. 

The nose was an initial scent of toasted wheat bread.  Other aromas were of alcohol, simmering meat, and prune, with an extremely faint bark presence, perhaps alder.

The flavors allowed this lager to really shine.  It started with a light sweetness that became slightly drier as it sat in the mouth.  This sweetness then dryness, accompanied by light but lively carbonation, really gave the tongue a full workout.  There was an alcohol presence that was subtle rather than overpowering.  The primary flavor was of stew meat, which, as the lager warmed in the glass, tended toward increasing nuttiness.

A little bit of alcohol is evident, but not as much as I was fearing. its extremely well integrated actually. Theres an undertone of tinny hops that is mild buy keeps this sweet brew from being cloying, which speaks volumes of the quality of this brewers abilities.

Below is old commentary, from 2002 and updated 2006, explaining why I rated this a 4.9 out of 5, making it -- at the time -- the best doppelbock Ive ever had.  In its original manifestation, this was the beer that started me onto beer fandom.  I liked it so much that I even went through the trouble of taking and providing the picture of the beer that you see to your left.  Any chance Id get (and that was rare), Id stock up on this.
Now, I am very disappointed that since that time, this brewer must have changed its recipe, because -- while a nice, solid, creamy German doppelbock -- it simply doesnt live up to its old name.  Theres really nothing any more that sets this apart from a number of others of its style.  Before, it was about as dark a Celebrator; now its just the same old dark reddish-brown that youd get with the Salvators and Optimators of 3.7 territory.  Gone are the intoxicating aroma, the brown sugar, the banana bread.  The only improvement was a solid head.
Selling out for the bottom line is inexplixable coming from monks.  So . . . why?
______________________

Original comments:
Well, I can finally get around to offering some substantive praise for this beer.  First things, though: this is a first-rate beer.  I know, anything in the top 50 beers in the world is first-rate stuff, but this is top-notch stuff even amongst those beers I already considered first-rate.  It was my first true introduction to how first-rate beers can be, and Im pleased at how well it has stood up to repeated tastings.

For the substantive part: We get a Doppelbock aroma worthy of the name: a strong hint of the roasty/toasty chocolate-coffee taste to come.  The appearance is a dark ruby, nearly black, though a head that reduces to about 5% of the initial size (but I can excuse this beer for that).  In the taste, you have the aforementioned character, with wonderful malty character well-balanced by a hop sharpness, giving way to a full, roasty finish.  (Hows this for a surprise twist: Banana-bread never tasted so fun. :-)  As different as it may be from the Celebrator, I cant say that either is clearly better, so I frankly dont see what merits giving the Celebrator a 2/10 point edge over this.  This is as close to pure liquid enjoyment as any good beer afficionado would find, even if not flawless (but no beer is, in my experience).  Even given its place in the top-50, its underrated relative to the other brews appearing there, so I really do wonder whether those giving this anything lower than a 4/5 really realize how special this beer is, and how enjoyable a beer can be.  (Maybe if malty sweetness in a beer just isnt your thing...)

In short: a first-rate beer and arguably the best of its style;  given its $2.50 or so price in a 16-oz. bottle vs. nearly $3 for a 12-oz. bottle of the Celebrator, its not a difficult choice for me to prefer this.  Where I can find it, itll remain plentifully-stocked in my fridge.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

Body is surprisingly and comically light, even watery, but quite soft and smooth, and the flavors dont reduce; beautiful malt (almost too much) and cocoa overtones, more regular caramel in the middle, earth and even dirt; fruit confined more to estery fumes.  The alcohol is integrated but there are wisps here and there of rough rocketeering, the classy kind though, as is sometimes found in the lowered-numbered Rocheforts (even the yeast/ester profile is compatible, though subdued).

Good palate, but no real complexity, in my opinion.  I should say that on the label was printed the numbers ""09.01.01""  Perhaps this sample is four years old.

Strong, almost concentrated, malty and fruity nose with rich chocolate, plums, light vinous notes and a little liquorice. So thick and treacly in the mouth, very light in carbonation and made more intense by the strong concentrated flavours. Prunes, raisins and sultanas, toffee and toasted malt, and a dry vinous back that blends into a roasted malt swallow that lingers between each slow sip. Quite sweet without becoming cloying, it had a lot of fruit in the mouth once it warmed a little and really belied its almost modest alcohol level.

Re-rate.  Neat to see what you think of a beer over a year alter, when your palette has changed.

Strong aromas of hazel nut brittle, fruit preserves and a hint of cinnamon. Starts very rich...silky-oily mouth feel with a massive malt wallop...sweetness pervades in the rich malty body with distinct notes of burnt toffee, some berry and spice mingled with the very rich malts ( the hops at this point sit in the background preventing this from tasting overly sweet). The finish is beautifully lazy as the big malts and sweet spiciness mutate on the tongue to a more complex mix and the hops make this a semi sweet finish like raw bakers chocolate with fruit and nuts in it.. then the lingering after taste leaves the metallic hops on the back of your tongue to mingle with a detectable ""warming"".

Looks almost like a stout, though I can see the brownish head from the underside. Big aroma of molasses, malt, and... blueberries, it seems, or maybe canteloupe. Taste has an up front bitterness that calls a stout to mind again, but then is replaced by roasted malt sweetness, lager yeast, woodiness and another fruit overtone.

2468,"2003-12-22",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2004 Took on parallel with Celebrator. Aroma of the weltenburger is pretty much owned by celebrators. Lighter than expected, but still doppelbock-ish, corpulent malt with notes of ashes and smoke. On the appearance side, its brown with ruby reflects and pretty much comparable to Ayingers. In mouth, were dealing with vinous chocolate and vanilla. Its the malt fest, beware! Very sweet, but restrained by underexpressed smoke. Medium-full body. Very good, but my malt-head was expecting more and this was definitely not up to celebrator in my book, it could only dream of approaching ayingers labyrinth of scents.  Almost a year later. This bottle furnished far smaller head, not keeping up despite a straight pour. The aroma was expressively malty once again. Lots of nutty and pear nuances. Bold earthiness manages to contain the lips-sticking moderately thick palate by a hair. Peaty finish, woody, quite rich, but I dont seem to enjoy that as much as I used to..

My expectations were too high.  The aroma is indeed a wonder, with strong fruit essences, particularly plum, in addition to a good stock of caramel with a hint of licorice.  The mouthfeel is nice, slightly frothy with carbonation but rich texture.  The flavor produced something that I found uncomfortable, hinted at in the aroma but stronger on tasting--a candy/caramel flavor that also carries a lingering bitterness, plus some saltiness.  The alcohol is well hidden.  Very enjoyable, no doubt, but short of greatness.

To begin with this thing looks and smells beautiful - it rolls out a huge shiny satiny darkness with embered tones and is redolent with rich shoe polish and molasses, some whiskeylike edges. Not quite so gorgeous in flavor, some lingering sours there, but mostly beautiful - dark sugars (molasses and maple, anise, a bittergrit nutmeggy edge to close.

The aroma is quite earthy, like charred toffee, also dried tinder wood.  The malt flavors are terrific, although a bit more subdued than expected.  Balanced nearly to perfection by a dry, lightly bitter flourish.  Im afraid that any dopplebock I drink for the rest of my life will have to stand up to Celebrator (unless I find Andescher), and this one doesnt cut it.  Not quite, but not too far off either.  Very different in many aspects, and excellent in its own right.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
2468,"2002-12-19",4.2,"Very thick, foamy, cascading head; dark thick viscous body.  Nose is almost pure molasses, with a hint of brandy for good measure; flavor continues the sugary dark molasses theme, but adds smokiness and a hint of sourdough; super-malty and slightly pungeant.  Mouthfeel could be a hint thicker, but its awfully creamy and delicious; finishes rather dry for a doppel.
