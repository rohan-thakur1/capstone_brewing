A clear favorite around the house I was only able to try one of these before the six pack had disappeared.  robust, well balanced, and ideal example of a weissbier this was just the ticket after a busy day. It reminds me that from time to time it is wise to revisit old breweries instead of chasing the latest and greatest. Otherwise you may just miss hidden gems.

Aroma / Appearance - Bubbly golden fluid poured lazily into the shaker glass. A clean white head looked as it had been run through a washing machine with ample bleach. Delicate and soft it almost seems like it will falls apart just from a wrong glance. Lemons, orange peels, citrus, and tart yeast give this a summery feel. Well balanced no one aspect dominates the overall experience.

Flavor / Palate - Lemons bubble across the palate with ease. Refreshing and dry the yeasty bite first parches before rewetting the throat. The only flaw is a little nitpick - this does get thin from time to time. However with all that it has going for it I wont criticize it too harshly. Trying to make this bigger and bolder would ruin what is a good summer lawn beer.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3.0 A: Cloudy darkish yellow color. I guess I didnt give it enough of a twirl as there is some yeast clumps at the bottom of the glass. Two fingers of frothy white head. Most of it falls quickly, but the last 1/4 inch is stalwart. Leaves behind only a touch of lacing.

5.0 S: What a lovely aroma! Pleasant throughtout with a neutral wheat backbone and spicy yeastiness. Theres plenty of banana phenols and, lemon zest, and peppery yeastiness.

3.0 T: Unfortunately, the taste doesnt measure up to the nose. In fact, its rather bland. The wheat comes through, but theres a lack of other flavors than youd come to expect. The spicy peppery yeast is gone. No hints of banana, straw, or lemon zest. Too bad.

3.5 M: Light body. Good full carbonation. No flaws, but just average.

Appearance: Served to my end of the bar a clearish, light gold body with a small, white head.

Smell: A nose smelling predominately of husky, grainy wheat malt and cloves paired with lighter, though noted sniffs of lemon and Noble hops.

Taste: A start of anticipated tangy wheat malt with an integrated lemon citrus character and slight sweetness. Enter the cracked cloves which really push aside the other tastes. A light backing of Noble hops provides an additional spiciness and light bitterness. As it warms, the lemon flavor increases slightly. Finishes dry with a final mix of malted wheat and cracked cloves.

S- Lots of citrus upfront with a big peppery spice essence. Big yeasty and banana smell in the background.

T- Lots of peppery spice upfront with accents of citrus and bubblegum. Firm yeasty backbone. The finish is a combination of citrus and bitter hops and comes off a little bit acidic. Sweet bready yeast along with a residual spiciness linger. I just love this spiciness in a hefe.

P- High carbonation and sweet, smooth yeasty body with just the right amount of thickness.

O- This is a great job by Victory. Great interpretation of a German Hefe. This is a great and drinkable summer beer. Its too bad I didnt pick it up until after the release of all the Oktoberfests. Will stock up on plenty of this next year.

The flavor starts sweet and malty and wheaty - delicious. Some spice and fruit (clove phenols, banana esters) come in faintly at mid-palate - but not overwhelming. They are a wonderful complement to the wheaty and malty character of the beer. The finish is crisp and incredibly refreshing with a touch of noble hop bitterness and a slight tang from the blend of hops, phenols, and sweet malts.

The mouth-feel is very crisp, very refreshing but perhaps a little over-carbonated.

Loads of vanilla and clove aromas (somewhat sugar cookie-like), with the more fruity banana and citrus notes bringing up the rear. In the mouth the vanilla and clove lead the way again, but the fruit centred follow-up is a bit more complex, with some darker spice notes coming into play.

Flavor is a reduced yeast product showing, with esters, classic hefe notes, and a smattering of random hop and malt notes, pale and relatively clean. A bit skunky, tints of DMS and mouthwash. Lightly chewy resin hops back out the driveway. Body ebbs thin, but the curt chemical profile defies the naming of heavily drinkable. Mediocre at best.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

The flavors of the malt and the yeast just never cease to impress me.  A nice yeast and malt taste that just knocks my tastebuds out with the citrus taste. The yeast is very distinct in this beer.

This had deeper spiced notes, second most robust in our little taste, with added emphasis on the citrusy, floral notes. Great balance here of cloves, banana, wheat crackers. Lots of subtle nuances in the flavor as well. This leans more towards a grassy, slightly green take on the style. Its a nice beer with a well rounded flavor profile. The finish is reasonably tart with a lemon seed aspect. I enjoyed the transition over my palate from juicier flavors to the drying finish.

Pure note of bubblegum emerges fairly late, but hangs around long enough to help pillar the body. Quite juicy and quenching with a pleasant unripe pear acidity and a hint of green banana as well. Malt, however, is grainy and thus fails to impart any significant depth or anything for the subtler flavors to latch onto. Harsh minerals lend a firm bitterness late which compounds the graininess. Wheat-derived starches develop as it warms, and contribute a nutty sweetness. Finishes soft and slickly fruity with green raisin and delicate banana notions, but rather short in length with lingering chalky yeast.

RERATE: (4/2007) Beautifully hypnotizing pour grabs your attention with those yeast clouds spinning around, lovely. Starts off clear pale yellow then goes cloudy. Has a very thin ring around the inside of the glass for a head. Been a while since I had a good wheat and this has been long awaited. Light citrusy aroma is unique and attractive. The taste and feel of this beer is way above average. Delicious lemony taste that tingles with each sip. Cannot detect any hints of bitterness, just plain well behaved. Lovable, delicious and almost refined. Overall I would like to drink this again. The finish leaves you wanting more.  Interesting mild linger than lets you know you had refreshment.

Ample carbonation to display, but thats about it. The aroma was highly phenolic, clove spices and even pepper in there, yet a plastic type scent present as well. Without taking a sip, this wasnt off to a great start. Flavor was pretty solid, a substantial wheat base covered with citrus zing and twang with a nice twangy and clovey finish. Bananas were present at the right level, but behind the cloves and wheat, especially as this thing warmed (cloves took over then). Mouthfeel was zingy from the flavor and carbonation, which certainly kept the buds stimulated. Along with the clear appearance knock, I wanted more in my mouth, bigger body. Would like to head back to this on draft one day. Cant believe this is the first time Ive hit this beer.","","User37895"

Delectable buttery croissants meet cloves to spice up the flavor while lemons are equally prominent, singly serving as a brightening component.  Recession is all banana corn flakes.  The flavor, which was initially right on,  is now more or less a standardized hefe formula.  Fizzy, spawning and light-bodied with encapsulating, champagne-esque effervescence.  Corn Chex signals the finish, along with a touch of peppered spicing and biscuit batter.  Not the best hefe, but still, its virtually impossible to go wrong when drinking Victory.

Its a very pale wheat beer, straw in color and fully cloudy.  The head is a snow white color, and though it only rose to maybe half an inch in height, its settled at a quarter inch and refuses to subside to filminess.  However, Im noticing that the head does not stick to the glass at all, but slides down easily.  The nose is solid spice/clove and light banana, plus a bit of citrus and wheat in there too.  The wheat and lemony citrus are more evident in the initial flavor than they were in the nose, but trail off a bit in the finish.  Inversely, the banana and clove start off somewhat subtle but continue on into the finish without dropping off.  But I think the problem is that the overall flavor is a bit shy.  I dont need it to kick me hard in the groin or anything, but I just want this to be a little more assertive.  Body is light-medium and carbonation is gentle on the palate.

Taste is a citrus/lemon/bready wheat up front, but theres no tart or bitter taste to it.  Immediately after the first flavors hit the mouth, some notes of yeast, corriander and banana come through with some retronasal lightly spicy hops and cloves.

Victorys version is much lighter on the banana and clove than a typical German hefeweizen, such as Franziskaner, or even a lot of American examples, like DeGroens.
