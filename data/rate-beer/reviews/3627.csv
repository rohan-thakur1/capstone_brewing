Impressions: Supposedly this is a Dutch interpretation of the English bitter style (the label says ""American bitter-ish""). I find few connections, except in the after taste.

Has that unmistakable Belgian yeast character (sharp, floral, sweet, loaded with esters), cereal grain and fresh pungent floral bitterness - maybe not quite balanced, but interesting as hell (8-). Taste follows - less malt sweetness, just slightly raw graininess, extra bitterness, a little cat and resin which was not in the aroma - an oddball.

How: Bottle 330ml.  Consumed 9 months after bottling date unfortunately hard to get De Molen beers fresher than this over here
The look: Cloudy dark blonde body topped by a large white head with good retention
In long: The hoppy nose is bright, very floral, lemongrass, yellowed grass and dried lemon zest.  Interesting.  Taste is a bead of neutral bready pale malts, fluffy yeast that does not take too much room and a bright crisp hopping.  Hops are lemony, grassy, floral, spicy and a bit topical/citrus fruits.  Finish is moderately bitter, a bit tart and a bit acidic.  This beer is very refreshing and absolutely sessionable.  This is again a bottle conditioned yeasty European IPA except that in this case it doesnt turn into a muddy yeast soup and the beer remains crisp and fun.  I liked that beer more than I thought I would, a pleasant surprise.  Its amazing how an surprisingly good beer can cheer me up.  I thin I know the solution to cure sadness: it is good beer.  And I also know the solution for world hunger: it is food.  Anybody else has complex social-economic problems to solve?","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Its fresh and delicate with floral notes, citrus, grassiness and is nicely balnced, though it does suffer from being a bit watery in the mids to finish, as in actually tasting water and also it just seems to lack any depth. I know De Molen can produce well flavoured beers at lower abv, look at Engels for instance. This just doesnt succeed in the same way. Sure on a hot day this would go down a treat as a cold beer to glug, but other than that theres not a whole lot going on. De Molen rock as brewery and I love that Menno experiments, sometimes you just have to the the rough with the smooth.","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"
