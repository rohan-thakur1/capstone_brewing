2297,"2017-04-16",4.5,"While Im still new to Sierra Nevadas Ovila Series, Ive been very impressed by these offerings. This brew has the humble good looks of a brown abbey ale. Rich dessert-like aromas - candied fruit and toasted sugar - with light spiciness. Malty chocolate flavor with some molasses and Port wine character. Theres a great deal of cherry but you also pick up on other dark pitted fruits as well. Velvety softness on the palate. Its highly complex yet cohesive, just like every Belgian-style ale should be.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Pours deep brown hue with a small tan fizzy head and no lacing. nose has accentuated coca, dark fruits and some cherry sweetness. Flavors really show the coca and cherry notes. not overly that complex but more a tasty fruit beer than anything. Short finish with some lingering cherry sweetness. not much to write about here.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"

A- Bland, bready, subtle dark fruit.

A- Copper color, clear liquid, tan head.

T- Malty, candy, sweet.

P- Medium body, average texture, average carbonation, bland finish.

O- Not a lot of flavor. Cherry is very minimal and really just tastes like they left out all flavor.","Ravenna, Nebraska, USA","HuskerTan"
2297,"2016-12-25",3.6,"750ml shared by Anndiesel. Deep brown-burgundy body. Foamy beige head. Rather big and doughy, not sure the cherries are a logical addition at all, they sort of conflict with the deep fruity yeast esters that are already there. Easy on the palate. but just doesnt work for me flavorwise. Searching, and missing. Overall such a quality product that it works out, but it certainly doesnt make me think that cherries and quad are a good combination.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"

2297,"2016-12-03",4.1,"From bottle in Belgian ale glass. Pours reddish brown with foamy head and malty aroma punctuated by cherries. The malt sweetness and chocolate overtones work well with cherry tartness on the palate. A nice rich quad.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","ANZUShophunter"
2297,"2016-11-27",4.1,"750 ml bottle shared. The beer is a dark brown with a beige head of foam. The aroma has sweet molasses, a fruity note, and some belgian funk to it. The beer stays sweet and gets a little bit boozy. It has a bit of a chocolate covered cherry thing going on, although the cherry itself is not all that evident. Subtle, perhaps. Huge body and moderate carbonation. Pretty good beer overall.I really enjoyed it.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"

2297,"2016-11-09",3.8,"2016/11/09 - Pours a hazy dark brown colour with a foamy, khaki head that slowly reduces and leaves ample, sticky lacing. Aroma is brown sugar, toffee, Belgian yeast, chocolate, cherries and tobacco. Taste is dark chocolate and cherries, with a toffee backbone, Belgian yeast and hints of licorice, tobacco and booze. Odds hints of glue in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is full and sticky with smooth carbonation and a dry, bittersweet, moderately warming finish. I didn't enjoy this quite as much as the quad with plumbs, but this is still pretty damn enjoyable.

2297,"2016-09-23",3.5,"The bottle I had said ALC of 9.2 rather than rating above at 10.2. Smooth mouth feel. Malty aroma with slight cherry nose. ALC level evident, but not over the top with a pronounced malty sweetness and a slight bitter cherry taste. Finishes quickly with a lingering bitter cocoa taste. Enjoyed more as a sipping beer as it warms.","Woodbury, Minnesota, USA","flatearthman"

2297,"2016-09-18",3.8,"Bottle, 9.2% ABV. Very dark red brown with a beige head thats soon a good coat. Aroma of brown sugar, cherries, (erm) paint, raisins, a little chocolate. Medium to full bodied, carbonation is on the low side. Sweet with more (milk) chocolate than caramel or dried fruit. Cherries are a lightening touch rather than a flavour completely integrated in the beer - which works quite well in this instance. Bitterness creeps up a bit and combines with some stemmy notes nicely at the end. In two minds about this - does it carry the alcohol with aplomb or is there not enough depth and grunt to justify its strength? About 70/30, I guess.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"

2297,"2016-07-29",4.2,"Bottle from Greenslopes Cellars 230716. The one thing that I didnt realise about this beer until after I drank it was the high alcohol content as it hides the alcohol really well. Glad I shared this bottle. Reddish brown colour with a swirl of foam sprayed across the surface. Cherries, raisins and chocolate are all there in the aroma and the beer warms, or maybe that should be numbs, the mouth as you drink it. Bought this a part of a mixed 3 pack.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"

2297,"2016-07-01",4.3,"From the corked, caged 750 ml. bottle. The pour is dark amber with ruby red hues glistening in the light. Quick lasting off-white head. Big aroma of Belgian sweetness, black licorice, candied sugar, a touch of chocolate, and low to no hop profile. The cherries are muted in the aroma. The body is medium to full. There is a slight tartness in the taste probably due to the cherries but otherwise it has all the roasted malt goodness of a typical Quad. Booze is buried.","Allenstown, New Hampshire, USA","puboflyons"
2297,"2016-06-29",3.8,"Shared 750 ml. 2016 bottle poured to a snifter displaying a fairly clear, mahogany hue, with a presentable layer of tan head foam, and spots & streaks of lacing. The nose was sweet, plum, prune, cherry, and cocoa. Medium bodied, with fair carbonation, the taste was similar notes, continued sweetness, some additional, light treacle, a bit of tannic astringency, and a comfortable booziness to complement. Nice, but I think a little cellaring might have uncovered even more complexity.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
2297,"2016-06-24",3.7,"750 ml. corked and caged bottle. Pours a medium light, tiny bubbled, light beige head, over a clear brown (SRM 25) body......nose is cocoa, chocolate, light cherry, no hops, malts and cherry are dominant....taste is moderately to heavy sweet, with cherry, chocolate, hints of plum, no phenolics, mild herbal hop notes, balance to the malts and cherry.....mouth feel, medium sticky body, alcohol warmth present, carbonation makes for light acid and creaminess. This is a very pleasant, easy drinking beer. It is not a very good quad as it is simple in both aroma and taste, and the reason is the added cherry. A bit lighter quantity of cherry would improve.

2297,"2016-06-17",4.0,"Bomber sampled at catch 22 bottle share! Pours a deep brownish red with bubbly off-white head that leaves moderate lace. Aroma of large amounts of dark fruit, nice mild Belgian esters, and sweet maltiness. Taste follows, big on the fruitiness and esters, booze is there but not over the top. Solid fruited Belgian.","Marietta, Georgia, USA","jbruner"
2297,"2016-06-14",3.6,"750 ml bottle from Malt Traders (part of 3 pack). Strong aroma of cherries. Taste reminds me of an ale with cherries added. Cocoa in the background adds a nice depth of flavour. The mouth feel is more like a cream ale than a Belgian, which leaves me a bit disappointed. I really like the fermentation that the Belgian yeasts produce.

2297,"2016-05-23",3.7,"On tap @ Torpedo Room. Dark brown/mahogany pour with some murkiness to it. Theres a nice dark fruit character all the way throughout here. Good cherry, raisin, and plum. Some dark caramel, brown sugar, and molasses, too. Its certainly sweet, but theres enough of a tannin and tang from the fruit that balances it out...though not completely. Good chocolate and just a touch of bitterness. Solid quad.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2297,"2016-05-14",4.2,"750 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 2/17/2016. Pours crystal clear very dark reddish brown color with a 1 finger dense and rocky tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, brown bread, toasted biscuit, cocoa, peppercorn, light banana/bubblegum, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, cherries, and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, brown bread, toasted biscuit, cocoa, peppercorn, light banana/bubblegum, herbal, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Light-moderate peppery yeast spiciness and slight fruit tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, plum, cherry, fig, date, apple, caramel, brown sugar, toffee, molasses, brown bread, toasted biscuit, cocoa, peppercorn, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, cherries, and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from yeast spiciness as well. Medium carbonation and medium-full body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy, and lightly slick/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding fruited quadrupel style! All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, cherries, and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

2297,"2016-04-30",3.7,"Poured from a 750 ml C&C bottle. 
Aroma is fruity with a lot of cherry character as well as some bubblegum and stone fruit from the esters. Some light raisin and fig notes. Moderately strong malt notes with dark caramel and toffee. Lighter toasted bread with a touch of roast and burnt sugar. 
Pours a dark brown with some reddish hues and a medium large, thick, tan head that shows really nice retention as it slowly recedes. Light lacing and medium legs. 
Flavor is fairly sweet with some moderately strong cherry notes. Lots of caramel and lighter toffee notes. Hints of chocolate and roast with some light burnt sugar and toasted bread. Light raisin, plum and prune notes. Lingering dark candi sugar. Medium bitterness with a hint of alcohol. As it warms there is more chocolate and cherry. Some medium light esters. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium carbonation and a fairly dry finish. Light astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, a nice beer but Im not amazed by it either. It seemed to finish too dry and dark for a quad and overwhelmed the yeast characteristics.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Nose is banana nut bread, clove, dates, dark toffee and a bit of cherry since Im looking for it. Flavors are the same, plus some cherry cola and bubblegum after a while. Finish has just enough hints of ash, roast, soy and prickly green herb to provide a balance. Heavy body is smooth with low-medium carbonation and definitely leans to the chewy dessert side of the beer spectrum.

The taste is sweet, spicy, and tart at the near same time. The cocoa and dark pitted fruit catch my immediate attention whilst the cherry tartness struggles to catch up. Mild clove adds to that ""genuine"" Belgian taste. Sweet comes from the cocoa and what Id describe as candi sugar.
