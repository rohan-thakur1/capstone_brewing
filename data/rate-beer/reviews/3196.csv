3196,"2016-04-19",3.5,"Pours a pale golden yellow without much of a foam head. Aroma is grassy, fruity, and bread malts. Flavor is sweet fruit and some bread malts. Has a light, well-carbonated body. A nice, refreshingly light offering that stands well above commercial pale lagers.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","chucklemation"
3196,"2015-07-06",3.4,"Poured a golden color from the can with aromas of grass, light sweetness, bread and some light herbs. Flavors were the same, nice breadiness to it with some grassy hops, decent and refreshing in the heat. A great lawn mowing beer.","Florida, USA","burg326"

Starts moderately sweet with pilsner malt, biscuit, and some neutral fruity character. Very mild hops, with light orange blossom. Finish is sweet and smooth, with light sweet after.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"
3196,"2014-09-05",3.2,"Can. Clear bright gold pour with a small head that fades to a nice ring. Aroma is sweet pale malt with some light lemon peel and herbs. Tastes like sweet crackers, lemon, herbs, and hay. A bit sweet but very easy to drink. Nice pale lager.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
3196,"2014-07-21",3.8,"This one pours from the can into a pale transparent golden color. Thin foamy head that dissipates quickly. A slight wheaty grass smell. A very refreshing and crisp taste. An earthy fresh taste. A nice lemon drop flavor. Great level of carbonation. Very drinkable. A slight dry finish. Also with the low ABV you can definitely put these down all day. This one is great right from the can while sitting outside. A great summer beer.","Michigan, USA","SpongeRuiner"
3196,"2014-06-28",3.2,"Can. Gold with a small, white head. Sweet hay and sugar. Surprisingly sweet and light.","Michigan, USA","Mittenator"
3196,"2014-06-17",3.1,"16 ounce can into lager glass; no canning date, but is a recent release. Pours fairly crystal clear bright gold color with a small fairly dense white head with decent retention, that reduces to a slight lace cap. Minimal lacing on the glass, with a moderate amount of carbonation retaining the thin cap. Aromas of light lemon zest, pear, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Ok aromas with well balanced pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester notes; with poor strength. Taste of slight lemon zest, pear, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness. Zero bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of light lemon, pear, cracker, bread, herbal, grass, and yeast earthiness on the finish for a short bit. Decent robustness and solid balance of pale malt, earthy hop, and yeast ester flavors; with no cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and light body; with a very smooth and crisp mouthfeel that is good. Alcohol is well hidden with no warming present after the finish as expected for 4.5%. Overall this is a mediocre pale lager. Pilsner malt character is extremely light and there really isnt a whole lot of flavor. A very crisp, clean, and smooth drinking offering. Not bad.","Michigan, USA","superspak"
