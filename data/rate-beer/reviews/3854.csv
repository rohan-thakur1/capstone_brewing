3854,"2017-05-05",4.0,"16 oz. can from seeswo - thanks again, Chris! Pours a really hazy goldenrod with a finger of white head that eventually settles into an uneven ring and a bit of film while leaving plenty of lace in the glass. It starts off muddled initially, fruity and doughy and without much hop character coming through. Then as it opens up, a good Simcoe-Columbus bitterness comes through, giving off the aforementioned fruits (pineapple, citrus, mango, and melon), with pine, grass, florals, and some underlying sweet malts. Medium-bodied, with a fruity, bitter mouthfeel and moderate carbonation. Really nice.

3854,"2016-05-25",4.1,"Fresh bottle, courtesy of Chris. These ""Street"" beers from Trillium are great ways to really get to know a specific hop, which means that the ""Double Dry Hopped"" versions are even more pungent. IÂ’ve never had a more powerful blast of Simcoe in my life! This is all about the hops, and they are earthy, grassy, a little piney, resiny, and slightly citrusy. ItÂ’s not a full-on juice bomb like Fort Point or Congress Street, but itÂ’s a great showcase of Simcoe hops.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

3854,"2016-05-18",4.1,"Tasted on 5/18/16 from a capped 750mL bottle, big thanks to Drews for sharing! Pours cloudy pale orange with an average, sticky white head that leaves average lace. The nose is full of orange, pineapple, and light hint of pome fruit, with a bit of pine and light malt. The flavor is very nicely bitter, more tropical fruit than the nose with a little less citrus, still an interesting apple note, with just enough malt to tie everything together. The body is medium, a bit sticky, with average carbonation and a long lightly bitter, apple, and tropical fruit finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

3854,"2015-08-30",4.0,"32oz growler filled 8/13/15, drunk 8/30/15.Large white head slowly fades to cover atop a moderatly-to-highly hazy, but not milkshake-like body that is a deep golden with some bright tangerine/orange hues.Nicely elegant as the regular summer street, with that tell-tale juicy/fuzzy tangerine and lime hop character mixing with soft honey-like malts. Clean, fresh house yeast, bits of baked bread and nectarines emerge as well. No alcohol, no flaws. Maybe a touch juicier/fruitier than the regular version, but very similar, obviously.Sleek carbonation spreads lime, lemon, honey and nectarine flavors about as watermelon, and very juicy, overripened ruby red grapefruit flavors emerge on the finish. Good attenuation, but dextrinous as well, giving the beer a medium-full body. Some light pine resin builds up on the finish, but isnÂ’t problematic and is easily balanced by the malt. Actually helps clear the palate, as well.Certainly donÂ’t understand how I found the regular version to punchy/acidic. Well, the punchiness, I get; obviously that beer was too young compared with this beer which had more time to age on the dry hops and clean itself up. Still, I wouldnt have expected all of that resin/acidity to have diminished so much. This is really nice and even though itÂ’s still a bit challenging for me (despite the balance, itÂ’s definitely quite hoppy and not short on bitterness, as well, itÂ’s big and malty, despite the good attenuation). CanÂ’t deny the enjoyable lime-melon-nectarine thing going on. Even the light pine on the end is kind of fun. CanÂ’t believe I just said that. Also, the beer is in immaculate condition, as is always so impressive about TrilliumÂ’s beers.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3854,"2015-08-26",4.5,"The fresh hop flavors that run from mango to pineapple and from overly sweet and ripe to sappy, acidic not-quite-ripe creates an amazing hop complexity that reminds me of the first time I drank Three Floyds Dreadnaught in the 90Â’s or the first time having Pliny on tap in mid 00Â’s. Not an assault on the palate, but a mind blowing circus of everything from blood orange or grapefruit to sticky pine sap. 7.2% with a malt profile thatÂ’s sweet and bready if you can even take your mind off of the hops.
