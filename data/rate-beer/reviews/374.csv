Tapped out Amber. 10ºSRM.

Nose has acetic, lemon juice, white wine aromas.

Mouthfeel is juicy. Palate has some nice wheat malt flavors of wheat flour, raw dough. Other flavors for this one are a ton of white wine flavors and grappa like tannin finish. There is a brief fruitiness that evaporates into a dry, dusty, woody palate. Dry and very pleasing. Tartness is there but a lot less aggressive than some other lambics in the Spontan series, like the triple berry for example.

The aroma is very much like a proper gueuze, dominated up front by lots of wood, earthy forest floor Brett funk and medicinal herbs, overlaying a core that has sweet wine grape character from the barrels, pale pit fruits, and a slight lemony lactic note. On the palate it has a moderate level of sourness, the character of which is mixed lemon/yoghurt lactic and cider/white wine vinegar acetic. Acidity is balanced by a white grape and sweet wine core from the barrel, pears and under-ripe pale pit fruits. The finish is dry, very woody with a light earthy Brett funk. Moderate bodied with soft, effervescent carb. Its soft and rounded, perhaps verging on too round but the result is still elegant and very nice to drink.

Picked up last summer in Belgium I was finally able to share this great release with some other people in July. A fantastic gueuze has a different style than the Belgian versions yet still sparkles with a world class sourness. If these were not so expensive might buy them more often.

Aroma / Appearance - A transparent golden base shimmers with lively carbonation for company. A thin wisp of head curls around the edges. Sharp vinegar, acidic aspects, and sherry are tart on the nose. This feels a little heavy though overall it works well.

Flavor / Palate - Vinegar, sherry, and lactic acid are abrasive and refreshing at the same time. A sharp cheesy note carries to the vinegary finish. Like a champagne glass topped off by a splash of bourbon the sweetness, acidity, and texture are ideal. It would not be hard to drink a whole bottle in one sitting.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
374,"2014-08-04",4.2,"Doré, pâle et trouble, une mousse mince mais persistante apparaît lors du versement. Le côté funky de la bière est difficile à ignorer lorsquon y plonge le nez : cuir et écurie sont en vedettes. Des raisins blancs sont également de la partie, autant au nez quen bouche. Ainsi, on a limpression de boire un bon vin blanc ou un délicieux champagne tellement lacidité est prenante. Celle-ci contribue à activer le processus de soif de façon perpétuelle.

Wow, this is going to be a lot better than Spontanfrederiksdal...Looks like a lambic; bright golden body with plentiful carbonation and a medium white head that recedes fairly rapidly to cover. Perfectly clear.The strong oak and leather nose adds notes of band-aids and just a hint of burnt rubber a la Cantillon. Not too far off on many aspects of that one, with not quite the strength or purity of that one (touch of tin and rhubarb in this). Perfectly attenuated malt and no alcohol noted.Deliciously bretty in the flavor with more rubber, band aid and lime zest. Nicely carbonated with an effervescent but tight bubble and a supple wheat-like chewiness to the body. Some light bitterness up front seems to show light hoppiness but its consumed quickly by that tartness from the brett. No astringency or overdrying from the barrel and very light on any actual sauterne character. Like a 3F oude gueuze with a touch of Cantillon blended in.

374,"2013-07-26",4.2,"Pours a fairly pale yellow-orange color. Its somewhat cloudy, though I imagine careful bottle handling and pouring could render a clear glass. Medium white head. Pretty good bubblage for a sour. It smells like a gueuze, maybe somewhat young or, at least, from young barrels, but this is as close to lambic country as any non-lambic that Ive tried. Its delicate and complex with layers of funk and gentle acidity. It has the lambic mineral character, sulfur and iron. Mushrooms, wet hay, grass, mild vinous vinegar. If you gave me this glass blind, Id probably guess Drie Fonteinen or Girardin, based on the aroma. Knowing what it is, Im getting a bit more oak than Id expect from a lambic, but that could be bias creeping in. Lots of fruit - apricots, berries, peaches, lemons, limes, persimmons. I could smell this beer all day, which sounds kinda weird, admittedly. The taste starts with gentle fruity sweetness and very mild grain. Acidity creeps up slowly and the beer dries out completely by the finish. More lactic than acetic, but its a lambic-y mix. The finish has a lot of oak. Nice tannic hit aftertaste. Lots of lemons, funk, grass, earth. Some wine sweetness, which takes away a touch from its lambic-ness, but again, Im left wondering if Id notice it blind. Its light on the palate with a medium pucker that sorta sneaks up on you. The tannic oakiness is a bit bracing. This is simply delicious. I wish that American breweries would take note and start pushing domestic sours in this direction. I imagine getting lambic flavors right is rather hard, but its worth the effort. We need more lower abv, lambic-style sours.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
