54,"2016-12-08",4.2,"Hardywood continues to impress with barrel aging. This barrel aged version of Gingerbread Stout is complex, its spinning a lot of plates at once. But it doesnt drop a single one, and the show is glorious. This beer pours big and brown with average head. The aroma is just a series of clamoring nosegasms. Everything you might think could possibly be there is there in spades, with vanilla and ginger and spice and raisins all blending perfectly into that delicious stout malt base. The flavor manages to pack it all in there, keep the tones bright and distinct, and not lose a bit of it. This aint noise. This is music. At once there is a rush of bourbon barrel aging, cinnamon, candied fruit, candied nuts, and big, sweet malt. It never gets old. It never becomes cloying. Its crazy.

>>> A good barrel-aged spicy stout that, despite not being easy drinking even for the style, is rather cohesive and well ""balanced"". 

+  Spices, bourbon, caramel, and vanilla share the spotlight in a rather cohesive way 
+  The barrel treatment is well executed and not overwhelming 
−  Despite being rather well balanced, a flavor profile like this one make the beer cloying quickly 
−  Although its deeper and more complex than the regular version, it still only have an average body for the style

54,"2014-07-15",3.7,"750 ml bottle from RABinCO back when he was RABinVA - thanks again, Ryan! Pours a deep amber color with a small tan head. Lighter in color than the regular Gingerbread Stout. Notes of gingerbread, caramel, brown sugar, wood, earth, pepper, honey, vanilla, earth, and bourbon. But the bourbon is pretty light overall, just adds some sweetness to the regular one. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sweet, spicy, malty mouthfeel. Good treatment, but I just dont think the base beer is as strong as it should be.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

Aroma was some light spices, roasted and sweet malt characters, and what appears to be gingerbread, lots of boozy notes - oak barrel. Flavor is still strong with the holiday spices - lots of dried fruits, bourbon character is perhaps a bit subdued compared to fresh, but its still there. Lots of booze.

Not much of an aroma here. The barrel has stripped the beer of any gingerbread component and added virtually no bourbon character. Full-bodied and creamy with prickly carbonation.

54,"2014-01-12",4.3,"Location: 750 ml bottle from Pinsky, Thanks bud!, 1/12/13, 2013 Release


Aroma: The nose is bourbon over ginger bread cookies, roasted malt, molasses, and brown sugar

Appearance: A dark brown color, fairly thick pour, and a small ring of beige head with spotty lace

Flavor: The flavor is actually extremely well-balanced, the bourbon adds an excellent boozy component to the base beer that leans toward the sweet side, and the spice works nicely here too

Palate: The body is medium, leaning full, it smooth and almost silky, with a dry, bourbony finish

Overall Impression: 
This is excellent.  This base beer was really meant for the barrel treatment.  I love how the bourbon plays with the sweetness without overwhelming the underlying beer.  Truly a world-class offering.  Thanks again Pinsky!","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

While this is quite tasty, as with so many bourbon aged beers, I prefer the basic version.  however, I have been told that the bottled version of the bourbon GBS is the best, but i have yet to try it.  Pours a very dark black  with decent khaki head. Not quite as sweet as the base beer. Earthy, smokey, and not as gingery. Smoother than the original.  Very VERY good.   EDIT:  Finally had it in the bottle.  Its even better than on draft.  A truly amazing brew. EDIT: 2014 bottle release had noticeably less ""bourbon"" character, and much more notes of vanilla and coconut.
