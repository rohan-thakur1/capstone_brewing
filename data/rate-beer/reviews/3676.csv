Finishes with a sweet, vinous, woody, light bitterness. Lovely.","Sheffield, South Yorkshire, ENGLAND","Garrold"

3676,"2016-09-10",4.0,"Bottle from Cornelius. Pours dark brown with beige head. Nose is dried fruits, raisins, notes of red wine, sherry, light roast, sweet red fruits. Very tempting if vinous notes do not scare you. Taste follows nose albeit does not get all the way there. Dates, dried fruits, sherry and vinous notes, warming alcohol, light chocolate. Good balance, complex yet easy to drink. I like what the barrel does here but not all will - vinous notes are quite dominant. Excellent beer and sold without premium ""barrel price"".","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","nihtila"
