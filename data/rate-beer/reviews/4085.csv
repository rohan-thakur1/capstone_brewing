Age is 5 months. Smells a bit like pumpkin and brown sugar. Apple and plum taste. Banana. Very much a lot of nice flavors. An excellent jonge lambiek","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
4085,"2015-01-26",3.8,"On draught at In de verzekering. Nice white foamy head, good retention. Hazy yellow golden pour, somewhat murky. I got lime, earth, citric acid and vinegar in the after. Medium sour but full bodied mouth feel. Loved the grainyness, peppery hints and brett flavour.","BELGIUM","Beerconnaiseur"
4085,"2014-10-21",3.1,"Timmermanss unblended lambic, tasted at a Weekend der Spontane Gisting years ago; rooty, earthy, quite rough lambic, sharpish and lemony, a tad wry in the finish but complex and funky as to be expected from the genre. In comparison with Girardin, Cantillon, or Lindemans lambics, I found this one to be a bit unrefined - but Im a lambic lover, so glad I tasted this anyway.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
4085,"2014-07-13",3.6,"(Backlog) at spontaneous fermentation. (3 months) very hazy light golden pour, still. Aroma similar to a witte. Tart, lactic, fruit and leather flavors.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
4085,"2014-06-07",4.6,"2011. Invecchiata tre anni. Acidità tagliente, astringenza che avvolge il palato intrecciandosi con note leggermente floreali e citriche. Leffetto sul palato, almeno per chi piaciono le acide, è quasi divino. Buonissima! Tutta unaltra cosa rispetto alle altre Timmermans che ho assaggiato!!","","Buongiorgio00"
4085,"2014-05-26",3.6,"Cask @ In de Verzekering tegen de Grote Dorst. Hazy yellow with no head and no lacing. Aroma is really citric and lemony with floral presence, grains cheesy notes, nice funk and wood. Taste is lemony and citric, very tart with light floral notes, wood, hay and vinegar. Light body, Soft carbonation. Dry and mouth puckering. Even in a blind tasting, it would be easily recognizable that its the Timmermans lambic I think. Tasty, but not one I would drink gallons of. Taste side by side with the Girardin Oude Lambik and they couldnt be much more different.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
4085,"2014-05-26",3.6,"On cask at Grote Dorst. Hazy yellow pour with thin white head. Aroma is quite potent, very distinctly citric, lemony aromas, light graininess, fresh pie dough. Taste is quite tart, lemony, light flouriness. Palate is dry with light carbonation. Actually reminded them of their oud gueuze, similar level of acidity. A bit too potent, but still quite nice.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"

APPEARANCE: light clouded blond beer, nice stable white head? This is a lambic right?
NOSE: nice sourness, little lactic, fruity, grains.
TASTE: nice and sour, sourness spreads all around your mouth! fruity, some peaches. Very nice Lambic!","Gent, BELGIUM","PriorL"
4085,"2013-08-24",3.9,"Enjoyed at the 4de Gents Bierfestival, 2013. This seems to be in that 6 to 12 month age where the appearance is more of a Jonge Lombik so Ill put the rating here.
The sample was tapped out of a beer engine and delivering a hazy deep gold body that supports a semi loose near white head of foam. The aroma offers up soured citrus, slightly moldy grapefruit, sweaty socks and a bit of vinegar. The taste is crisp and heads quickly into puckering tartness. I get lemon and grapefruit and then some soft faintly sweetened vinegar notes. This ends dry and moderately tart. Cool experience.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Quite brilliant. I really love this stuff.

4085,"2013-02-03",4.3,"Apparently cask from a wooden barrel? Sampled @ Brugs Bier Festival 2013. Apparently brewed by a new brewer  one that Uli was quite exited about  things apparently bound to change. Hazy golden, typical bubbles but more than usually. Sour lemon in the nose, very sour lemon sorbet, tad watery with lots of lemon acidity, almost touch added, finding bad similarity with their Oude Geuze, very light flowers. Taste is lemon acidity, almost added, sour lemon sorbet thing, sour apples, served too cold, way too, light flowers, reasonable, lightly lactic sour Obviously flat, light touch watery, Simple but enjoyable, eases the thirst, very easy to seasion a lot, yes this would easy do the trick. Many would probably find this too easy. #25 Unblended Lambic.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

Lovely golden yellowish colour, very acid nose, but in the tastte there was still fruityness, grainyness, and dryness too, which kept very long.
