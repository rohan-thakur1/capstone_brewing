233,"2016-07-14",3.5,"A crisp herbal aroma and cereal maltiness, with just a hint of fruity and tart. Enjoyed more than expected.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
233,"2016-06-08",3.3,"Bottle. Pours a clear golden color with a foamy head. Aroma of citrus, light fruit and herbal. Taste of citrus, light fruit and trace of malt sweetness. Nice bitterness and a clean finish. Light body, crisp and quite refreshing. Nice beer but a tad much on the citrus.","St. Charles, Missouri, USA","Bif"
233,"2016-05-18",2.6,"11th May 2016, 22oz bottle shared with my wife while on holiday in California. Poured into Corsendonk badged stemmed tulip glasses. Cloudy body, dirty orange in colour with a full white head. Half Kolsch, half Wheat beer is where my thoughts went as we sniffed and sipped this beer in the warm afternoon sun. Refreshing and different, not sure I could have had the whole 22ozs though.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"
233,"2016-03-23",4.1,"Wow damn solid, old world herbal earth and pepper, lightly creamy edge, crisp body, low ester, really good.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
233,"2015-10-27",3.4,"Draft. Clear bright golden yellow with a small white head. Grassy cereal aroma. Flavor is light, dry, tart, somewhat grassy. Light bodied and drinkable. Pretty good kolsch.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
233,"2015-09-03",4.0,"Great for our fricking hot desert zone. This is a light beer yes crystal clear and fuzzy yes. But something so much more that a bud or coors...it is called malts my friends. Not big dark malts just perfect amount of light malts for flavor and then quaffffffff.","Yucca valley, California, USA","Low69caprice"
233,"2015-06-10",4.1,"Excellent example of a Kolsche. Crystal clear great carbonation. Noble hop aroma slightly bitter taste super dry crisp finish.","Palm desert, California, USA","Ratpatrol1019"
233,"2015-05-05",3.3,"Pretty good. Sticks it on the style points. Easy to drink and totally what I was expecting. Not normally a kölsch fan, but this satisfies.","La Mesa, California, USA","Bartzilla"
233,"2015-05-02",3.7,"Love the name of this. OK, my bar is set pretty high for Kolsch. Hmm. Here we go. The 22oz bomber pours with a slightly hazy deep gold body that supports a dirty white head of foam. The aroma offers up a bit of fruity esters, malts, vague mineral to earthy spicy hoppiness and then a mild breadiness in there somewhere too. The taste turns this in the right direction. It has fairly crisp punchy hops that come across as bitter noble hops that have a floral to an earthy spicy to a thin lime like sensation to them. Behind the hops lurk mild malts that have a slight cracker sensation. This is tasting pretty Kolsch-y. I like the light non sweet body and crisp hops. Solid.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
233,"2015-04-08",3.2,"Bottle at home. Pours lightly hazy pale orange with a medium, frothy off-white head, short retention with spare lacing. Aroma is Pils and pale malt, light earthy and spicy hops. Flavor is crisp malt, light earthy and spicy hops and bitterness with a dry finish. Light body and moderate carbonation.","Escondido, California, USA","BeerandBlues2"
233,"2015-04-06",4.2,"WONDERFUL Kolsch. Seriously. Incredibly flavorful. A slight sweetness. You cant go wrong with this one *for the style*.","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","mikedR"
233,"2015-01-01",3.0,"Poured from a bottle it is a clear golden with a big white head. The aroma is pineapple and the taste is a slight bitter taste of malt","mclean, Virginia, USA","Westchesterco"
233,"2015-01-01",3.0,"From a 22 oz bottle shared at home on New Years day. Pours a clear gold with a white head. Bready nose. Flavors of biscuit. Crisp finish.","Jackson Hole/McLean, Virginia, USA","Iphonephan"
233,"2015-01-01",3.0,"Bottle. Golden beer with a big cream head. Light lemony citrus aroma with light hay. Malt and light grain flavor with lemony citrus. Medium bodied. Malt and light grain lingers with light lemony citrus.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
233,"2014-08-19",3.4,"Bottle. Probably not super fresh considering where I grabbed it from. I had it on tap this spring and remember liking it more. Pours a clear straw with some head. Aroma gives you grains with faint hop presence, taste is moderately bitter, finish is dry. Pretty good but again, remember liking it more on tap... I think the hops have faded a bit.","Valley Village, California, USA","Ontape"
233,"2014-07-16",3.6,"Bomber from Capitol Beer in Sacramento, CA. Pours light gold with a slight white head. Smells sort of bready and mildly white berry. Med body or nearly. Flavor is rather spicy, and floral/white berry. Followed by some bread. It is crisp and clean. But its a bit like someone poured a little Fume Blanc into the beer. If this was a blind taste, Id probably think it was a pretty good pale lager.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
233,"2014-07-13",3.4,"On tap @ Coachella Valley Brewing. Clear golden pour with a tall white head. Nose is nice and bready, though a touch grainy. Some floral hops, straw, and a touch of cracker. Slight grassy hop note to the flavor. More bitter than Id prefer, but good bread and grain sweetness. A hint of apple, some cracker, and maybe a bit of popcorn. Light floral hops. Probably my favorite of their beers during my visit.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
233,"2014-07-06",4.5,"This was a great beer to sip on in the 110 degree heat of Palm Desert. Will definitely have some with me by the pool on my next trip to the desert.","","marnie417"

233,"2014-05-16",3.4,"22 oz. bottle. It pours a yellow color with a small white head. The aroma is white crackers and lightly floral, noble hops. Very clean and balanced. The flavor is a bit more citrusy with more florals and light bready/cracker malts. It has a clean and dry floral finish. A very pleasant and somewhat traditional Kolsch.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
