A: Dark red with a firm creme color head.

T: Very bitter, even astringent, with some backing malt. 

M: Medium body, alcohol burn, crisp carbonation.

O: Not sure about this one. Its more like a Double Red than a Vienna. Got away from them a bit - might have to re-review with a different batch.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"
1735,"2015-12-29",2.4,"22 ounce bottle purchased at The Davis Beer Shoppe. The aroma on this is a very pleasant, sweet, floral aroma with caramel maltiness. The hops really unleash a very nice floral bouquet. So quaffable. Transparent amber-colored body with a medium, light orange head. Good lacing, but the head is a little weak. Starts with a hoppy, bitter, astringent earthy hop explosion. This is super bitter and harsh. Theres very little malt character here to back up the really heavy medicinal hop bitterness. Super dry. A severe disappointment.","Woodland, California, USA","DYCSoccer17"

1735,"2012-12-22",4.3,"In short: An exemplary golden lager with a freshness sensation that you dont expect from a bottled lager.  Excellent.
How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed fresh a few days after receiving it from mcberko, thanks a lot Matt.
The look: Clear golden-amber body topped by a medium off-white head with medium retention.
In long: Aroma is discreet but very inviting when you bury your nose in a full pint.  A toasted cereals freshness and also a freshness in the yeasty esters that I cannot put into words.  Taste is expressive toasted cereals with just enough caramel, leafy hops, toasted bread crust, soft freshly baked cookies, some homemade iced-tea, dry tree leafs, grassy notes.  A dry and refreshing finish.  A full body that feels light.  A beer with expressive sweet flavors but never actually tastes sweet.  A freshness sensation that I normally only experience in brewpubs.  Kick-ass Vienna that at times tasted a bit like a dunkel.  Superb session beer that is really a standout in North-America where beers like this one are occasionally brewed in brewpubs but almost never bottled.  This might be one of my rating ever, yesterday was dec 21 2012 and apparently lots of people are afraid the world is ending in 2012 because the Mayan calendar ends in 2012, well, I dont wanna freak everybody out but my desk calendar also ends in 2012.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

1735,"2008-10-16",3.5,"Deep copper with a smooth off-white head. Nutty caramel up front, smooth with a medium bitter finish and some fruitiness. The hops don’t come through as much as the bobtoberfest, but the malts give that nice warming feel that I got out of it. Another solid offering of theirs.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
1735,"2008-10-12",3.7,"22 oz bottle courtesy of DA.  Pour is ruby brown, hazy with a 1/2 inch off white head.    Fair amount of lacing left behind.  Aroma of sweet dark fruit and brown sugar caramel sweetness. Taste is mostly the caramel maltiness, though is drier and earthier than the nose would have suggested.  There really is quite a bit of flavor and complexity in this.  Like the Heater Allen Pils, it is pretty simple and straight forward and complex at the same time.  Palate is thin to medium, very drinkable.  This would be a very nice winter session beer.  Really impressed with this brewery.  Thanks for sending this my way Derek!","Kansas, USA","theisti"
