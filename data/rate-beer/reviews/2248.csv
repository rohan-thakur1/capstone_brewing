Clear amber colour; Half finger head and soapy off-white foam which fades in 30 seconds; Fair sticky lacing with quite fizzy small carbonation; Fragrant aroma of rich malt, with strong yoghurt tartness, red wine, light sherry, liquorices, cherry, hint of vinegar, candi sugar and light bread; Strong sweet taste of malt, with moderate wine vinegar, shades of red wine, light red fruits, carbo, sugar, light bread, light lemon and light grass; Close to light body. Thin and slightly slick palate; Mouth feel is malty in fairly watery background, dominated by light wine vinegar and pleasing, candi sugar sweetness. Light red fruit with hints of wine and light liquorices. Light lemon to round. Simple and kinda okay Hoppiness is no nose, with light lemon and light grass in taste. Bitterness is from liquorices for an abrupt, light astringent sweet malty finish; Slightly dry after taste. Sweet and very easy to mouth.

Pours an amber color with a big off white head that fizzes out like soda pop but remains atop the beer in a generally wispy fashion for quite some time.

The aroma is strikingly funky and pungent, lots of lemonpeel, and only a faint caramel, but as the glass sits it gets less pungent and more sugary smelling. 

The flavor is sort of akin to caramel syrup. Some grassiness and mild tartness but must of the character of the lambic has been replaced by toffee and caramel. 

By aroma alone this could have been my favorite Faro but the flavor was so one dimensional and focused more on the candi sugar, either way I feel like Id try it again if I got a chance.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

The taste is much too sweet for me: you nearly only taste the sugar candy, with the lambic only lightly on the background. The beer evolves to a caramel taste. But as this sweet taste is typical for Faro, and because it doesnt taste artificially sweet, this beer just gets away with it.
