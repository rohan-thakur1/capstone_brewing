There is a strong honey sweetness and lots of dark fruits. Its got a strange herbal aspect to it that Im not crazy about. The flavor is much of the same. The sweetness and the honey really work with the dark fruits. Its got a little zing of herbalness and a touch of honey. The mouth feel is light and clean with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly malty with a dark fruit and honey note on the back end. The sweetness of the fruits is strange. Not the best beer, thats for sure.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

2593,"2017-04-16",4.2,"While you can only guess at the true authenticity of the origins of a beer like Midas Touch, theres no denying how fun it is to try Traditional beer styles. As the name suggests, Midas Touch is gold-colored. As you might expect for a beer brewed with malt, grape must, and honey, Midas Touch ends up tasting like a mix of beer, wine, and mead. Its fruity, semi-sweet, and a bit spicy. I couldnt tell if the latter taste was from the hops or from the added spices. In any case, this is a refreshing brew that drinks easy and finishes bone dry. If Egyptian beer was truly like this, being paid with beer wouldnt have been a bad deal.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Overall, this one was interesting, particularly historically, but its not something I would want to drink regularly and am honestly glad I got it at a bar as opposed to a 4 or 6 pack cause it was good as a one off, but isnt something I would favor typically.

Interesting nose with both beer and mead qualities. Notes of barley malt, honey and grapes.

Light medium body with a somewhat smooth texture. Normal carbonation with just a touch of effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the finish.

The flavor profile is surprising. I was expecting much more of a honey influence. It begins with a mish mash of flavors at a reasonable intensity level that reminds me of a bitter white wine. Grapes are noted, but the main flavor component is a medicinal note that comes in the middle and lingers through the finish. Towards the finish, you detect a soft honey sweetness in the background, but not enough to provide balance. The finish is slightly dry and the medicinal off flavor lingers.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

Belga élesztő és marcipán, cseppnyi alkohol aromái ezek, mely összhatás egyébként már meglehetősen ismerős lehet számunkra belga sörös tapasztalataink alapján. Testes, markánsan édes ital képét vetítik előre, ami az első korty után rögtön beigazolódni is látszik azzal a toldalékkal, amit a komlós utóíz hiánya, illetve a végső fázisként előálló szakasz virágmézhez hasonló jellemvonása okoz. A komló jelenlétét ez esetben eredménytelenül kutatjuk, annál intenzívebb viszont az ennek megszokott helyét időben megelőző ízhatás. Némi fűszerezettséget is felfedezni vélhetünk, mely ez esetben a leírás szerint a sáfrány kellene, hogy legyen. Alkoholos jellege idővel egyre inkább előtérbe kerül, így téve még inkább likőrössé az egyébként is desszertszerű főzetet.

2593,"2014-05-20",3.7,"Transfer from BA review on 2-27-12 - 
Poured from bottle into tulip shaped glass
Appearance  Pours an orange-golden color with a little bit of haze. Upon pouring there is a very light white head. The head fades to give a moderate amount of lacing.

Smell  The nose is heavy in grape aromas up front. There is the light biscuit smell mixed with a little bit of sweetness in the middle of the smell. At the end, some alcohol and a floral like aroma (hard to place) work their way in to round out the smell.

Taste  There is a dry malty flavor up front. The grape flavor then comes more prominent and begins to overshadow the malt. There is a light bit of honey sweetness with the grape flavor; very light and subtle, yet compliments the grape quite nicely actually. Toward the end of the taste, just as was detected in the nose, the alcohol comes to the scene. The alcohol mixed with the grape leave a rather odd aftertaste in the mouth, not awful, but not the best either. Overall it had a taste like a kind of bready-white wine.

Mouthfeel  The feel of the brew is quite nice. It is on the creamier side which allows it linger on the tongue. At the beginning of drinking the brew the carbonation level is a bit too high, but when left to sit for a bit, it diminished and created a lightly carbonated brew that when mixed with the thick body gave the tongue quite a nice experience.

Overall The feel of the beer was fantastic, but the taste was a bit unbalanced. In the beginning it tastes more like a beer that then seems to turn into a boozy wine. It has some very nice individual characteristics yet the transitions of them from one to another dont really make for a smooth drinking experience.","","Darkmagus82"

Pours a golden amber with very little head. I wont go into the ancient history"" of the recipe of this ale since I wasnt around when it was supposedly originated and wouldnt have a clue on how to compare the two. The aroma is sweet and reminds me of some type of Belgium ale. The taste is also sweet with a hint of some spices(?) that dont overwhelm the sweetness but does seem to diminish it a bit. This is a smooth beer and goes down easy. I think this is a really good ale and one for people that think Belgiums are too sweet..

Bitter and subdued at first but with a bit of effort the background sweetness, grapes and honey come through stronger thankfully. There is plenty of spice, some of which seems to linger a bit and this is followed by a solid malt smell and some caramel too.

2593,"2013-11-03",4.2,"355 ml. bottle obtained in a trade with Ibrew2or3. Thx! Drank 1/3 of the bottle. Shared the remainder with multiple people. Pours a clear golden with an off-white head that manifests itself mainly as bubbles on the sides. Smells sweet, main component is white (Muscat) grapes here with some honey & saffron, sweet spices, some yeast, not bad. Taste is pretty heavy on the white (Muscat) grapes which is the main flavour here, some honey & lighter saffron in the back, getting some lighter hops here as well, bitter yeast, touch herbal in the back, floral & slightly worming. Nice but nothing about this really pops. I expected more given the story, concept, ingredients etc. Nothing wrong with this but as most DFH beers, this doesnt really fulfil the promise made by the concept.

2593,"2013-09-30",3.2,"12 oz. bottle from January 2013. Pours filtered golden, thin white short lived wispy head with a bit if lacing. Smell is Chardonnay, sweet malt, honey, clove, a touch of spice, some alcohol. Taste is as advertised, sweet with the honey, tart with the white grapes and a low carbonated beer mouthfeel. Alcohol bite is tamed, and is more consistent with a wine than a beer. Basically a mead/ wine/ beer which is what it is meant to be. Not sure if this style totally succeeds from a beer perspective, and is not exactly my cup if tea, but it is different and quite refreshing. I like that DFH always seeks to set the standard for beers outside the box, and this is another example even if it isn't their best effort.

2593,"2013-09-09",3.4,"Served on-tap at Terrys Terrace at a pretty pricey $8.50 a pint.

Appearance: Not much to it -- a pretty light color with basically no head -- lacing is almost completely non-existent, though its what I expected. Meh.

Smell: I dont usually get much on aroma in most beers (especially out of a shaker pint), so its hard for me to give specifics, but I really just got a lot of herbal grapes without much else.

Taste/feel: Quite a bit like the smell ... but its not as nice on the taste buds. Truthfully, an odd beer. Like I said, I DO have a minor cold, but I can still taste mostly fine. It just tastes like grape juice with herbs for the most part. Thats just not my bag. I dont get much malt tastes specifically, just a lot of the fruitiness and sweetness. Its drinkable for sure, and the alcohol is COMPLETELY unnoticeable, but I dont think Id try it again. The feel is solid with a nice carbonation, but its never harsh, so the beer goes down easily.

Midas Touch is a beer Ive been interested in trying, so Im glad to have had it, but its just too much for me.. I find that it almost drinks like a high ABV wine cooler. Drinkable, yes, worth the price, hell no. Of course, thats just one guys opinion. If youre a wine drinker, youd enjoy this one quite a bit.

2593,"2013-05-24",3.0,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a mostly clear straw color. The head is a one finger white shade. Its texture isnt particularly appealing, and the rest of the brew isnt particularly attractive, either.

S: Lets see, on the nose we have honey, grape, grains, mild diacetyl, and an herbal component. Not all of it comes together successfully - in a way, the aroma smacks of a white wine meeting a malt liquor by way of a car crash. Interesting if nothing else.

T: Sweeter than the nose indicated. An initial quality of honey and grape sweetness is the first flavor noted, slightly drying out to a grainy midtaste and finish. Saffron notes mildly augment things throughout. The whole ""malt liquor-cum-white wine via car crash"" descriptor I threw out before suits the flavor profile perfectly; its a combination that sounds horrid, but the end result is only rather blah.

M: A bit heavy on the tongue, aided by its initial sweetness. It becomes very dry past the midtaste, and actually very easy to drink. Carbonation is mostly covered up by the syrupy qualities.

O: Why the disparity between the smell/taste and overall scores? This is a simple example of a brew greater than the sum of its parts. My initial opinion of the aroma and flavor profile isnt particularly positive - and yet, the whole thing kind of works after several sips. Im not sure if its because the dry finish gives it great drinkability for 9% or what not, but it ends up being pretty decent. I can see wine drinkers enjoying this a lot.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

An off-centered beer for sure. This blurs the line between beer, champagne and wine, but that was what the brewers intended. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and it has a great story behind it.

Based on the description I was bracing for something overly spiced and more like a kitchen-lab experiment than a drinkable ale. I was wrong. Pours with little to no head, and in a dark golden shade. It looks as special as the bottle suggests. The aroma is heavy on grapes and a strongly inviting sweet wood underpins the boozy feeling on the nose. The taste is pleasantly balanced with liquorice just slightly at the forefront of a bold, sharp, and warming mouth-feel. Whats left on the roof of the mouth brings us full circle to the grapes.

I had a four year old sample of this brew served by Sam Calagione in 2006. I remember liking it much more than the fresh version, so I bought a four pack and cellared it for just shy of four years.

A: Midas Touch appears golden and hazy with an 1/8"" of head that leaves some faint lacing in its wake.

S: Grapes, grape juice with an assortment of spices.

T: I believe the sweetness has mellowed, and the beer has a subdued alcohol presence. The taste is tannic and / or of alcoholic grape juice. Four years of aging has created a smoother, more mellow version of the beer.

M: Having benefited from time in the cellar, the alcohol presence is muted. The beer is medium-thin in body, with a present sweetness.

D: A fun, unique and interesting beer. Kudos to Dogfish Head for pushing the limits. I wouldnt want more than a few ounces of this. Midas Touch is an intriguing brew, and worth a try.

Smells of candy sugar, plump juicy sultanas and of a dozen kinds of juicy lollies from a jar. This smells incredibly pleasant. While not complex (or too complex for my appreciation) this smells just gorgeous. The flavour is richer and puts me in mind of a cross between a late harvest wine and a lighter kind of Pinot Noir. Then it becomes that candy store sweetness again; rich and mellow, golden and honeyed. This beer is remarkable, one of those ones that you sit and think about, drawing a dozen conclusions before taking your next sip and changing you mind all over again.

2593,"2012-02-22",3.2,"From notes.  First reviewed 8/5/2009.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

Midas Touch pours a transparent light golden color with an off-white head that bubbles for a second before slowly fading. This definitely elicits thoughts of what I think mead would look like, but the soft color and lack of residual lace is simply not very impressive.

Honey, light fruits, particularly grapes, along with a balanced spice palette that includes cloves and all spice give this a mild, herbal aroma.

The flavor introduces itself with crisp grapes, some mild spiciness, and of course, honey. The malt flavor takes more of a backseat to the main flavors. Alcohol permeates the taste through most of each sip. A slight bite at the end of the sip, but the aftertaste is still sweet, and the alcohol presence remains apparent as it slides down my throat.

A light, smooth feel with little carbonation. Alcohol definitely warms the mouth.

The sweetness mostly hides the strength of the alcohol. Still, I could only drink about two before I would start to lose interest in the honey flavor, and any delusions about drinking any more are crushed by the 9% ABV.

2593,"2012-01-13",4.2,"The Dogfish Midas Touch is a brew Ive had a few times, but finally sat down with the intention to review. Supposedly the recipe for the Midas Touch came from the oldest know fermented beverage. The concept of this recipe comes from analysis of drinking vessels in the tomb of King Midas, nearly 3,000 years old! 

The Dogfish Midas Touch pours from a 12oz bottle a dark golden-amber color, with just a touch of cloudiness. The head is very, very mild, and only reappears after some vigorous swirling in the glass. What foam does arise is nearly bone-white in color. At nearly 10% abv, Im not surprised by the head, or lack thereof. 

Aromas of the Midas Touch are complex and nearly baffling. Fresh out of the bottle, Im getting a touch of honey and mild spices. As the brew warms closer to room temperature, notes of florals, white grapes, herbs, and even a little noble rot (botrytis for you non-wine lovers). 

Taking a sip, wow, thats different! Not because its super weird, but because its so drinkable. Im getting hints on the palate of the honey, the alcohol, and some white grapes. But, all the flavors meld together quite well. Balanced, and subtle, each unique flavor compliments the others nicely.

The dough flavor starts things off, then there is some sweet fruit flavors followed by a bitter spciy finish(saffron?) that sticks on your tongue. Some nice honey notes throughout.

2593,"2011-10-19",2.6,"Bottle, out of a snifter.
Nose: perm solution, burnt hair....a friend suggested the smell of a conk, the old school black mens lye-straightened hairstyle.  I have never smelled this, but it sounds about right for whats going on here.  Definite corn aromas, but more dried corn kernels than the canned corn I usually get from dimethyl.  Floral notes, quite clovery mead reminiscent, but just an undertone to the other nasty smells.
Mouth: surprisingly not bad considering the nose.  A bit sweet, but not too syrupy in texture.  A bit boozy, but more of a vodka fume than offensively so (and actually pretty restrained for Dogfish Head).  Nice distinctive grapey flavor that screams Muscat, more honey/clover/mead, a bit of bready maltiness, and a tiny touch of spice--like the zip of paprika.  If anything, the body is a shade thin, but Id rather that than the alternative.  Pleasant carbonation.
Its an interesting blend of things you dont normally see together and it could be a lot worse than it is.  That said, I didnt finish the one bottle I opened, and its definitely not worth anywhere near $12/4pack!","denver, Colorado, USA","ephemeral8"

Luckily the flavor is more interesting and complex, and tastes pretty good. I definitely taste the muscat grapes, there is also honey, but I dont taste any IPA type hops, this is all about the malty sweetness, which isnt a bad thing, but dont say it will please the IPA drinker, because there is very little hops.

The flavour is moderately sweet throughout with a citric accent and plenty of honey. There are also floral notes and grapes and an acidic bite that complements the sweet notes. The finish is long and floral with spice. On the palate, it is light-medium in body with a slightly dry texture and soft carbonation.

Complex flavor; I notice the Chardonnay like grape profile the most.  The honey comes through as it lingers in the taste buds.  It has a dryness much like a wine.  Has a sweetness that Im sure is due to a healthy pitch of saffron.  The carbonation is lively and tongue tingling.  I give this beer extra props for being so different.  A wonderful ancient recipe.

It had a sweet smell like grapes and honey but was also floral. I was also able to smell the malts adding a bready component to it. The complexity of the aroma is mirrored in the flavor.

Aroma: The nose is very potent with a brisk white wine note.  It reminds me of Riunite table white. 
Appearance: It pours an opaque but nice amber orange.  A brief foamy off-white head appears but quickly disappears.  Its very effervescent. 
Taste: Sickeningly sweet with way too much honey and white grape juice.  There is a touch of malt and yeast in there too.  I cant pick up on the saffron.  I understand this is supposed to be a historical brew, but it is way too sweet for my taste. 
Palate: Medium body that feels heavier due to all the sugar.  It has a lower than average amount of carbonation (it all jumped out in the beginning) but what is there is prickly and aggressive.  The finish is very sweet and kind of lingers on the tongue.

2593,"2010-09-14",3.8,"On tap at the DFH brewpub. Golden color with a thinnish white head. Aroma mainly of white grapes and sweeter malts. Not much of a hop presence up front. Taste is very sweet at first but settles down after a few sips. Almost like a sparking white grape juice. Also getting some honey flavors, with just a hint of what I later discovered was the saffron. Alcohol barely noticeable at all. Slightly oily texture but overall very drinkable.

2593,"2010-09-03",3.0,"Aroma is fairly mild. Reminds me of a nice lager. Honey is present. Some grain, or corn. Reminds me of tamales? You can smell that this is a high alcohol beer. Appearance is orange apricot color with large dense white head. Large bubbles. Crystal clear. Very pretty and unique color. Taste is very interesting. Reminds me of a strong AIPA without the hops, mixed with a mead... with just a hint of grape flavor. It is a little hot like a wine and some of the meads I have tasted. Letting it sit on the tongue assures you that there is barley in this as you can taste the grain. Honey lingers as well. Palate is medium full. Kinda syrupy. Flavor that lingers is lager beer. Overall this is enjoyable and unique. Not as unique as I was expecting, but unique in that there are many hard to place flavors Im not used to having together.

2593,"2010-08-16",3.5,"Draft @ Als of Hampden, PA - This one really threw me for a loop...even though I typically love DFH offerings, I wasnt expecting much here for some reason.  At first glance, I see a honey-colored crystal clear brew with no head, save for the line of bubbles around half the edge of the glass. Aromas are a sweet and sour mix of white table wine and sourdough bread. It is soft on the nose. Its thick bodied and syrupy, dry from the honey, and a bit tannic. The carbonation is soft and fluffy. There seems to be much more honey than barley here. Id perhaps describe this as a spiced mead. The aftertaste is of grape must. It has a fair amount of sweetness, as others have noted, but not too much for the heavy bodied, well bittered ale to balance out. Id probably try this one again.","Gardners, Pennsylvania, USA","99beerman"

The age (13 months) may have muted the carbonation somewhat, as the pour left a golden and obviously unfiltered body with a minimal and quickly-dissipating head. Then again, that could just result from the high alcohol and sugar contents. Regardless, the aromas and flavors have mellowed nicely with time, leaving the strong scent of fine pinot grigio in the nose, a palate of smooth honey, and a lingering aftertaste of alcohol burn, tart green grape, and a hint of pale malt.

Feel is a bit bubbly. Its fizzy and thick. Its a choker-downer, like a saison. Quite thick and strong. Big, sour/tart film. Its a fascinating brew, really. Complex, overwhelming. One and Im done.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

The aromas are very different for a beer as its more close to Chardonnay. The flavors are a little light but grapes really hold up the end of the bargain with a honey malt balance, slight alcoholic ester but still well hidden, slight cereal grain.

2593,"2010-05-05",1.0,"There is a shotgun-like spattering of different flavors going on here. I dare say that the beers most overwhelming taste, however, is that of liquid Tylenol. I have the feeling that if you crushed Ibuprofen in your palm, threw it into a glass of champagne, then pinched your nose and shot the stuff down your gullet, it would have the same effect.

A+ for effort.","Birmingham, Alabama, USA","Gustav1996"
2593,"2010-05-01",4.7,"Aroma: The aroma of this ale is extremely complex; hints of a vinous grape character and honey are the first to blast upon the scene, followed by a floral bouquet of bright, springtime smells which hints very delicately at a bready malt undertone.
Appearance: As always, this ale was poured vigorously and the head rose to begin with, and quickly faded. The beer does retain a light but foamy lace afterward which is nice. The color is a slightly murky amber/orange color rather than golden, but I doubt they had filtration in 4000 b.c.
Taste: Im not sure what a 6000 year old beer is supposed to taste like, so I will enjoy the taste of this beverage for its own sake. The ale starts with a citrus punch and with very present waves of honey flavor throughout. This sweet delight, finishes with honey and spice. Theres only a hint of hop spice which I imagine is only there to balance an almost candy-like sweetness. Theres a wheat quality to this beer which lends itself with the grape character to feeling very wine like. A complex ale fit for a king.
Palate: Rich, rich, rich with wild and interchanging textures of acidity and sweetness which swirl around teasing you into trying to figure out whats really happening in this ale. The heavy sugar sweet character is not overwhelming though and finally the 9% abv. is deceptively hidden in the body and drink-ability of this ale.
Overall: I really appreciate a brewer with guts. Its pretty easy (for a professional brewer) to come up with and IPA, brown, amber, stout, etc. These all have been done and done again but Dogfish Head takes the daring step to take what amounts to a list of chemicals with an approximation of flavor and creates a rich, very decadent and complex ale that strives to break the mold and become a thing unto itself. Cheers to imagination and guts!","USA","Bludwig"
2593,"2010-04-22",4.3,"I had this on-tap at DFH brewings & eats last week.

A- Body is a nearly see-through champagne color with many bubbles that stick to the side of the glass. The head is foamy, white and smooth an was served to me at 1.5-2 fingers. It faded to a nice eggshell and retained that perfectly all the way down. Very little lacing was left behind in the glass.

S- The grapes come through as the most dominant in the nose. The scent is not too dry or too sweet. Hints of saffron and honey come through as well.

T- The initial flavor that comes through is a touch of honey with a dry fruity background and a pale malt base. The saffron kicks in for the finish for a nice touch while the other flavors strengthen and a quite boozy background kicks in. The whole flavor is mild but definitely not boring.

P- The mouthfeel is smooth and light with a spritzy carbonation.

O- This one is really a lot like a champagne. The mild flavor makes it quite drinkable, epically on a hot summer day. You can taste the alcohol a little bit more than I prefer but it is still very good. It was nice to try a beer as different as this one.

Serving type: on-tap

2593,"2010-03-29",3.1,"Light golden beer with little head but plenty of carbonation. The nose is honey, spices and grape. The taste is stronger on the barley with a lot of sweet grape following it. Theres enough spice and malt to balance things out for most of my way through the bottle but not quite enough. The sweetness lingers a bit, like drinking too much Welchs white grape juice. I used to love that stuff, but the flavor defines the term cloying. While Welchs is an over-comparison on my part, the grape flavoring needs to be toned down. The mouthfeel is fine but gets a little sticky, or that could be a flashback to my brown bag lunches in grade school.  It did not take me long to be ready to be done with the lingering sweetness. Its not a bad beer, particularly for the variety, and I wouldnt turn down a free one, but I wont be paying 35 cents an ounce for it again.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

A - Slightly hazy saffron golden orange. Decent sized white creamy head.

S - A lot of grape and honey. Also a good deal of spice and floral smell.

T - Lots of honey and semi-acidic grapes. Decent amount of malt present. A variety of spices dance around along with some floral and herbal taste. Sweet wine-like taste with the spices giving it a bit of a kick. Alcohol taste is present but not overly so.

M - Medium starting to go toward full body and moderate carbonation. Sticky feeling and flavors.

D - Not great. Definitely a beer to sip. Lots of spiced taste and fairly sweet and sticky hold it back from being a drinkable beer.

Tastes of honey and sweet maltiness. Light notes of sweet grapes. (Slight warming affect, but Im not sure if that is the alcohol content or the saffron. Does saffron do that? It doesnt FEEL like alcohol heat.) Nicely floral tasting with a tiny bit of hidden hops on the back end.

Feels good in the mouth, but it is perhaps a bit too thin. A bit more carbonation might help it, possibly.

A very easy drinking beer. Due to its sweetness and 9% alcohol content, it probably wouldnt lend itself to drinking more than one or two in a sitting.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","coldmeat23"

Alcohol-driven, slightly cakey aroma very much like a boozy English Barley wine of the Gold Label variety; notes of grass, almond, Special Brew, cherry Palinka...malty, caramelised, alcoholic. Mingles agreeably with the stench of Octos nail polish. Im warming to it. Flour, grass, lemon and honey like a pils or Oktoberfest. Opens with green apple, almond, nougat, honey..Some orange rind as it warms. Would never have picked out the Muscat grapes blind, but then I know next to fuck all about wine. Getting plenty of cherry and almond, wrapped up in a rich, Custard Cream-accented maltiness sticking around long after the swallow. Could be the honey, a much-abused substance in brewing, but here integrated to maximum effect. Sweet, biscuity and warming. Zero hop presence for a big US beer, itself something of a virtue. A little tangerine and lychee on the burp. Sort of like an English GA reduction, with the hops turned right down low. DFH really seem to get the malt.

Honey is pervasive in the initial flavor, and it is frighteningly watery, at first.  Then the white wine-like qualities kick in and things get interesting.  In fact, this is like a boozy white wine with body and mouthfeel.  Some ale-like malt and funk kick in in the palate, though seemingly at random, but that just keeps things interesting.  Alcohol is pourly hidden, but only somewhat astringent.  I understand why MrBunn didnt like this beer, hes not a liquor drinker and so this wouldnt appeal to him in any way.  For me, it is an interesting variation and departure.

Definitely the muscat grapes and honey. Carbonated Mead was my first thought after swallow#1 - the honey and booze were right there. The next few sips served up a really strange flavor that Id never tasted in beer before. Pungent and slightly off notes of earth and rotted vegetable. After finally reading the entire description and opening a bottle of saffron to compare - that was it. Saffron should be kept to Paella instead of beer, I think.

Again, the list of things in this beer is intresting and unique. But it just does not work. You have sweetness combating sourness the whole time your trying to pick up on other undertones.

I got nothing unique from the nose, it was simply that of a basic lager....hardly the rich blend I expected. Was this really 9% abv? We would see... The mouth was overly sweet with no distinction between the honey and grapes, it more resembled caramel additive, and the 9% abv was all but hidden.

Color: Gold with orange tint

Aroma: Initially smelled like dilute bleach possibly from a tidy, Japanese airport restroom. This eventually blew off and showed mineral, soft ripe pear,and oxidized notes that reminded me of some European white wines.

Flavor: Light honey, mineral, ripe citrus, a hint of dried nectarine. These flavors continued on the finish which lasted for 25-30 seconds.

Comment: Aged 1-2 years. Possibly like some kind of Belgium beer? Very wine-like. Good balance and mouth feel. 


Day 2
Color: Gold with orange tint
Aroma: Honey, floral notes, muscat grape juice, slightly oxidized

Flavor: Barley malt is more apparent on the 2nd day. Pear, peach, honeyed apricot, ripe orange and oxidized notes.

Taste is a tiny sour and tart bite. As uncomplicated as it sounds, it is actually very flavorful, just not for me. Surprisingly non-hoppy compared to most DFH stuff.

Mouthfeel is a high point, carbonation is medium and spot on, and the body is light.

2593,"2009-07-18",3.5,"Well, the first time I had this was at the Freakin Frog in Vegas during the epic night of a zillion beer and the awakening of my scotch addiction - some day Ill find that review...
Poured out a clear, gold brew with a decent white cap with good staying power and thin ropy lacing. The aroma is where this beer earns its stripes - kinda seems like a lager, which is a bit of a put off until a second later when the subtle tendrils of complexity hook into your nose and pull your face inside your glass to inhale over and over again. Since I dont know what Muscat grapes smell like I can only assume that I am smelling them. Every smell I take makes my mouth water. Definitely similarities to a cheaper Chardonnay (good in here), honey, flowers, peaches, thicker honey now. As it warms it gets a thicker aroma - excellent! The taste also has awaken a bit more now that Ive let this sit for an extended period of time. Thick. Odd honey/spicy/alcohol mix that sometimes grips me and other times turns me away. More wine here - no real similarities to anything Im familiar with, light chewy malts... Im losing my will to continue on with analyzing this flavour - coming across as some weird Belgian strong ale / strong lager blend. Thick mouth feel, lingering alcohol sucks but its blended with some bitterness (weird mix in this case). Finishes. This could really do without this 9% power. Looks like Im about as impressed as I was the time in Vegas where I way overspent to get this.

2593,"2009-07-17",3.5,"The Head Report by Beer:30

Thursday July 16th 2009

We poured this golden nectar at the recommended cellar temperature of about 50 degrees.  As the fermented libation fell into the glass the eyes is drawn to the bright but not overwhelming dark straw color.  It is a clear beer, which was of a little surprise to Doug, since he didnt think they had filtering devices in the realm of ancient brewers.

All of our scoring is based on a scale of 1 to 5 pints!

Appearance:  (Doug 4 pints, David 4 pints)

Dark straw in color, very clear, and minimal to diminishing head.  The pour is heavy but smooth from this 9% beer.

Aroma:  (Doug 4 pints, David 3.5 pints)

Off the bat David detected a mild to moderate alcohol nose.  Dougs aroma note is more of a slight spiced with clove and very slight fruity bread hints.

Taste:  (Doug 3.5 pints, David 3.5 pints)

Doug was able to detect the alcohol notes the David suggested off the nose.  Both raters felt that taste left us with some confusion as to what this beer is trying to be.  This is a very complex beer on the pallet.  Although for being as high in ABV as it is the alcohol is not overpowering on the complexities on your pallet.

Mouthfeel:  (Doug 4.5 pints, David 4.5 pints)

Doug and David both agreed this was the best component to this beer.  Wonderful and full mouthfeel.  Carbonation was wonderful, not to overpowering but not dished either.  With as much fermentable sugars that are/were in this beer during brewing Dogfish head did a masterful job of balancing carbonation in this high gravity brew.  This beer starts moderately heavy on the pallet but is so smooth like 18 year old scotch there is a sense of drinking something crafted and cared for.  Bravo Dogfish Head.

The Verdict: (Doug 3.5 pints, David 3.5 pints)

The fellas agreed again.  Dogfish head is a great brewer of beers but the alcohol notes detected by David and the overly complex pallet by Doug brought the Beer:30 scoring on this beer down.

Diminishing the Head:  Dogfish Heads Midas Touch is a big beer no doubt about it and being that its in the spiced and specialty category anyones ratings are completely subjective.  Beer:30 recommends that you get your hands on a bottle and try it.  We wouldnt recommend a 6 pack to try.  Find a good bottle house that will allow you to buy individual bottles.  Both Beer Advocate and Rate Beer have resources to find retailers in your area.

Keep on pourin

Some sweetness on the nose, perhaps some honey and then a bit of a grape note. Has a sweet flavor akin to grape juice, that I assume is from the muscat grapes and a healthy dose of two row barley.  Perhaps a little too sweet. Carbonation is light and the palate is sturdy on the tongue without being too much like maple syrup.   Finishes with a dry, spicy saffron note.

We both got some notes of malt, as well as some notes that one would associate with a good Reisling or Chardonnay.  On the palate, the beer is initially pretty sweet, almost tasting like a mead.  It has beer characteristics from the malt and hops, but also has a lot of winey notes; again making it hard to pick out distinct tastes.  As there is some notes of honey, one gets the sense that an artisanal form of honey was used, thereby leaving some aromas and flavors.  The finish is pretty much in the middle between sweet and dry.  

In the end, I love the creativity, the ability to hide 9%abv in a very drinkable beer, and the complexity of flavors.  However, I was just as mystified by the flavors after finishing the beer as I was when I openned the bottle.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

2593,"2008-11-20",3.8,"Pours a clear golden color with little head and no lacing to speak of.

Smell is of honey, grapes, and alcohol.

Taste is initially honey followed by a bitter herbal flavor and a strong alcohol bite. The finish is a nice blend of all of these flavors with the added hint of vinous grapes. Clear and distinct stages and a nice blend in the end.

The mouthfeel was surprisingly lite and the carbonation was a bit heavy but did not take anything away.

At 9% this is still a very drinkable brew. The alcohol is very present, but I think that adds to its depth. Nice drinking overall. Very different and definitely worth trying at least once.

Flavor is slightly sweet honey, bready malts, white wine (particularly in the finish).

The pale orange pour wasnt especially appetizing  in fact it looked a little dingy. But thats not a major knock. The aroma was very woody, and I wondered if this might simply be another oak-dominated beer. But the flavors are marvelous, with the grapes emerging perfectly in unison with the barrel flavors.

I can’t figure out whether I like it or not. On second thought I don’t think I’d have another. I’m not really big on the taste, it reminds me of something that had the sugar removed from it.

The flavor was slightly focused on a honey-barley flavor, with some fruit and floral components.  Having had mead in Prague, this beer was a fair reminder of that flavor.  A slightly cloudy straw-amber color with a smaller, foamy white head with moderate retention.  Wet and full on the palate with good fizz and carbonation going down; a drying finishing effect.

Undertones of sweet white wine, and very light carbonation which added a great touch to this excellent beer. No real hop pressence, more barley and malt. Very easy to drink dominated by brightness and sweetness. This was really different than any I have ever tried.

I couldnt tell whether I liked the taste or hated it at first - it does taste like a beer with some wine poured in. The grapes are still readily apparent, and the mouthfeel is sticky sweet, with a good alcohol burn, tamed only by the sweetness.

2593,"2008-08-04",3.9,"I have been wanting to try the Midas Touch from Dogfish Head brewery ever since I read about it in a magazine a year or so ago. With thanks to the sister and my late birthday present, I now get to partake of this exquisite and rather historical ale.

Midas Touch pours orange amber into my goblet, leaving a thin golden head which fades into a light ring around my glass. Clearer than I was expecting, I lift the glass for my first expectant quaff. In the nose I detect sweet amber honey essences, some herbs and almost over-ripe melon ~ cantaloupe or honeydew comes to mind. Wet and sticky, Midas Touch is very viscous and honeyish in mouthfeel and texture. Sweet and refreshing much like her honey nose and palate, she coats my mouth, leaving a pleasant sticky sweet feeling. Midas Touch warms beautifully, bringing even more of her lush herbal sweet and melon character to the forefront of my enjoyment. While she has a high ABV of 9%, Midas Touch doesn’t overwhelm and leaves pleasant warmth which lingers like a fire on a cool winter’s night. Nearing the end of my glass, I am reminded of a beautiful summers day, a cool breeze in the shade, me sitting in a chair soaking in the sun and the view as the aromas of growth and life and spring abound in my glass and my mouth. Sweet, succulent, smooth and full of honey, melon, and mild herbal essence. Midas Touch is truly worthy of a King.

Initially, I was a bit leery of Midas Touch. Sure, it had good reviews and had the gimmick shtick to go along with it, but that can sometimes spell beer disaster. Thankfully, Sam Calagione and the folks over at Dogfish Head know exactly what they are doing and have blessed the 21st century with a historical brewing masterpiece, Midas Touch. I am sure even King Midas would be proud.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Very full-boddied and heavy, yet very mild and tame. Sweetness that lasts for a very long time. Overall quite good! Strange, but I’d drink another one!","San Diego, California, USA","enginaaron"
2593,"2008-07-08",3.2,"Another of those unlike-anything-I’ve-ever-tasted beers from Dogfish Head.  Refreshing, crisp, but it’s difficult to tell if I’m drinking a copper ale or a white wine.  Still, tasty, and no indication of a 9 ABV.","Colorado, USA","That1Guy"
2593,"2008-07-06",3.5,"UPDATED: AUG 15, 2009 Bottle thanks to Woodsman52.  A very unique brew, but what else would you expect from Dogfish Head.  Hazy golden orange color with a white head.  Aroma is sweet, fruity, and some indistinguishable spiciness.  Has a mysterious flavor, with sweet grapes (similar to wine) and yeast.  I cant quite pick up on all of the subtle ingredients, but thats part of the fun.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Bigmmartin"

2593,"2008-07-01",3.7,"Small white head. Cloudy orange colored. Aroma is very similar to a Belgian style. Body is somewhat thick. Alcohol and honey tones in flavor. Saffron has a very unique charactor and is not overly noticeable in this. Nicely warming in the aftertaste with a definite wine character along with it.. They don’t list yeast amongst their ingredients so I’m assuming maybe they’re using the wild yeast from either the skins of the muscat grapes or from that residue found in King Midas’ tomb, they mention. I’ve been waiting for over THREE years for my friend to bring me some back from DC. Glad he was able to finally. I’d buy this again.Now I hear DFH is coming to California.

2593,"2008-06-26",3.7,"what an interesting beer.  aroma was grainy with a semi-dry white wine aroma at about the same intensity.  floral aromas as well.  pours dark golden in color and is brilliant in terms of clarity.  flavor was very nice, but I guess slightly weird.  grains and grapes meet pretty harmoniously, a mix of a blonde ale and a reisling.  medium full mouthfeel.  alcohol is well hidden.  A enjoyable change of pace from standard beers.","Shippensburg, Pennsylvania, USA","jehoey"

2593,"2008-06-19",3.4,"bottle.  aroma strongly of honey with grain malt, and an interesting spice scent, but that description doesnt do it justice, very interesting.  Tiny head on the pour, goes to nothing quickly, golden-blond color, little carbonation.  Lots of honey in the taste to start with a sweet grain malt, then more honey, green olives?, lingering with a taste in between the start and finish, lots of honey with a little something else (saffron?), smooth the whole way, thick, clingy mouth feel.   Very happy to have tried this ""beer"", weird at first, but i like it more and more as i drink it.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","Ceebs25"

I had to come back and re-rate this and give it a good rating the first time i tried this it was soured. I love this ale and i love finding it in stores when it comes out!","Paducah, Kentucky, USA","dalepryor"
2593,"2008-06-18",3.3,"A traditional ale based on an ancient Egyptian recipe that lands ""somewhere between a beer, wine and mead"". The end result is as bewildering as that description, but its refreshing to sample a beer that breaks new ground. Or rather, very old ground. Intense syrupy gold colour with barely a shimmer of suds. Fascinating aroma of competing odours - golden syrup, burnt matchsticks, pistachios and turpentine woodiness. Oily body, sweet and sticky. Mead-like flavours of honey, cinnamon, oak and thick sugars. Good bitterness. It would help if I liked honey more, because it stamps all over this like Godzilla. Hot but balanced. Not my cup of elixir but theres much to appreciate here. (Bottle courtesy of Linc at Sullys 2007 Xmas RB gathering. Thanks fellas.)","Blue Mountains, AUSTRALIA","highlandlad"
2593,"2008-06-17",3.4,"Bottle.  Aroma has notes of muscat wine, honey, caramel.  Golden honey hue with no head and no lace.  Flavor is mead, sweet dessert wine, and 7up.  Palate is almost lively but not soft.  A nice dessert brew with a cool story.","Saginaw, Michigan, USA","polomagnifico"

Hides the ABV well.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","DocHop"

2593,"2008-06-03",3.2,"Finally a Dogfish Head beer.  Just came to San Francisco & I am glad to find it.  Pours a crisp golden yellow with nice carbonation, almost spritzy.  Aroma is mildly pleasant with subtle malt and honey notes.  The muscat grape is only a hint.  I am glad it is not all about the grape.  Rich mouth feel with the grape & honey hitting the palate at once.  Saffron is apparent but again not a punch in the face.  Perhaps it would be more digestible with a lower finishing gravity, however at 9% it hides it strength well.  As it warms however, the grape really comes to the forefront of the beer.  I find that this takes away form the beer itself.  I would have preferred the malts to take over rather than the fruit.  Overall, a very nice surprise.  I am very happy to finally have it on the west coast.","Sonoma, California, USA","bumpskier"

2593,"2008-05-31",4.7,"A very nice ale with a small head that laces the glass. The aroma is flowery with barley and honey and a hint of saffron. It has so much flavor!

2593,"2008-05-31",3.8,"12oz bottle. Pours golden orange with a fluffy white head that around for a bit, some lace. Smells crisp malty and sweet.

Pours a very nice looking deep clear gold with white head, minimal retention. Not much aroma in here, but has nice slight notes of grape, malt, alcohol. Flavor is very suprising, strong grape, light honey, semi sweet with alcohol that is well hidden, the saffron does a nice bitering job with this combination.

The concept behind this beer is really interesting -- its enough incentive to make me want to try it. Definitely reminds me of a mead - but has some beer-like characteristics too.

At first whif, the nose is a bit Pilsner like, but upon deeper inhale, you pick up the honey and slight biscuit. The flavor is lively and complex, with a subtle bitterness leading the way, followed by a honey sweetness mid and muscat finish. Great on a California 100+ degree day, even though it is 9%!

I had this one with a cheese course of Petit Munster (stinky French cheese) and Smokey Blue cheese from the Pacific Northwest (Oregon, I believe) and had a blast with it. Even if youre not a fan of stinky cheese (what we used to call Fumundah cheese), you have to respect the wonderful balance and pairing this beer creates with it. Given the opportunity, Id do it all over again. It would also go solidly with Brie, and not-too-spicy curry dishes as well.","Tryon, North Carolina, USA","Perm"
2593,"2008-04-27",3.0,"The beer pours a bright yellow gold. The clarity is very good. The fizzy head is crisp and white but doesnt hang around and leaves weak legs.  The nose of the beer is light with a hints of citrus, sweet fruit mixed with yeast. The front of the beer is very sweet with notes of honey and a under tone of a fine dessert wine. The beer finishes with a very abrupt saffron that doesnt last. This beer reminds me more of a fine dessert wine more then a beer. The mouth feel is that of wine with a nice roundness and slightly oily feeling.","Sugarland, Texas, USA","texasbartender"
2593,"2008-04-27",3.6,"Poured into a snifter. Golden orange with a one-finger white head that dissipates quickly, leaving no lacing.

Grapey aroma with some obvious honey. Also a touch of the earthy pungency of a czech pilsener.

Flavor is initially reminiscent of a German lager as far as the malt base goes. The grapes meld into this maltiness seamlessly, and the honey provides a dry sweetness. This had the potential to be cloying, overly grapey, or overly honeyed, but Im impressed and surprised at DFHs tact in keeping this experimental beer pretty drinkable. That said, the flavor isnt all that great hedonically.

Mouthfeel is pretty good. Carbonation is a bit low, but the body is nice and full and theres really no booze in the flavor. Interesting beer, but not great.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

A bit liquer like. The flavour is very, very sweet and spicy with much honey and ginger. Just a trace of hop and alcohol is present, but not disturbing. Medium to full body, lively carbonation, long sweet finish with light bitterness. Not bad and original, but a bit sticky and too sweet and honeyish for my palate.","Firenze, ITALY","Slayer85"

There is a strong sweetness that is surprisingly well balanced by the other ingredients.The malt character is famiiar to beer expectations, but the overall structure is different due to there being no hops.

The mouthfeel is somewhat too sticky and sweet for my taste, but some will enjoy it.  This beer almost tastes more like a white wine than in does beer.

Definitely a unique brew that is worth trying, though for some it might be a bit too sweet or soft. For me though I really liked it and would go for it again.

Mildly alcoholic with a fruity hair spray coating.  Finishes on a slow settling of sweetness.  This smacks of steamed carrots and brown sugar with floral blossoms.  Dry when its all finally done.

2593,"2007-08-13",3.1,"Pours a nice golden with minimal lasting white head.  Smell is a slightly grainy honey sweet smell as it opens up a bit.  Also a twinge of something else, which I think is the grapes.  Kind of a slight wine like aroma to it as well, but something I cant quite pinpoint for sure, but I dont notice the saffron...  A bit unusual.  Wow, taste is quite sweet, but not at all what I expected...  Honey is prevalent, a grain taste as well, but almost none of the 9% alcohol is there which is a huge plus.  Has a bit of a white wine crossed with a sweet beer feel to it.  Very unique for sure, and not as crazy and undrinkable as I feared it might be.  Although it is a sipper beer, rather than a session type. Its still a bit sweet, but I kind of like it...","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"

2593,"2007-07-27",3.6,"Bottle from Corral Liquors in Granite City, IL. Pours a sparkling amber-orange with a small, fizzy, white head that diminishes to a thin cap. The aroma is of sparkling white grape juice, honey, straw and a hint of spice (not distinguishable as saffron). Very different. Medium-bodied and lively with a slightly chalky and dry finish. Tight, effervescent, spicy grapes and honey ending in a quick, dry finish. Interesting and quite different from any other beer that Ive tried. If I had to describe what it most resembles, Id have to say that it tastes like a blend of a light chardonnay, mead and a Belgian tripel.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

2593,"2007-07-18",3.4,"Thanks to my cousin for pointing this out to me. Deep, clear golden color with a head that disappears within the first minute, leaving only a small ring of froth around the rim and a cluster of tiny bubbles in the middle. Nose is dominated by a powerful pairing of spice (saffron, Im assuming) and honey, as well as some alcohol. My tongue is greeted by a light, sweet grape flavor like white wine (my brother is a wine guy, so from sampling some of his here and there, I think I can relate it to that). An ever-present herbal spice begins here and finds its place in all parts of the taste. Right on the heels of the grapes is a buttery, honey fullness that fills the mouth, and the experience ends with a spicy, tangy, slightly bitter warmth at the back of the mouth. Aftertaste is steadily fading buttery honey and spice. Mouthfeel was medium and oily with plenty of carbonation and tingling. Ill be honest in saying that I dont like honey beers (though Ive never tried a true mead) and I dont usually love beers that incorporate a great deal of spice; however, as I drink this now, Im experiencing a change of heart. This isnt that bad, and I sort of like it (which is as close as Im going to get).","High Point, North Carolina, USA","NCsparkster"

Decided jjpm74s gathering would be the best time to try it out, worried though how it stood up. Cork popped off with lots of force and the cork was a bit warped.  Poured dark golden/slightly orange, extremely murky, with a small head.  Aroma is mead-like with good earthy sweetness.  There is some alcohol in there, still lively and light aged maltiness (cardboard). Taste is similar but the age seems to have set in a bit more here with a real emptiness at the end of the flavor.

2593,"2007-05-13",3.2,"12 oz bottle from Jimbowood, I think.   Nice golden color..... Slight aroma of corn sweetners and wine.  Flavor is super sweet, with a touch of bitterness from the grapes.  Very boozey.    Better than most of the Dogfish Head beers, but that aint saying much.  Props to them for being experimental, but dammit, I just want a beer I can enjoy.........keep your grapes and saffron and witch hazel or whatever else you put in this......just make a tasty beer.","Poway, California, USA","Naven"
2593,"2007-05-12",3.6,"I will say they continue to raise the bar on going out there.  This beer pours light tan with serious notes of grapes.

2593,"2007-05-12",3.3,"Poured light golden color out of the bottle with very light head.  The head left very quickly without a trace. Smells like beer, but has a lot of different hints to it. There is definitely some fruit and some raisin. It smells a little like a mixed jam, but not as sweet. This beer has a lot of flavor concentration. It is both sweet and bitter at the same time. I can definitely taste the honey and the saffron. It has good flavor, but I dont know that I could drink more than one of these in a sitting.","Bozeman, Montana, USA","natejgood"
2593,"2007-05-09",3.1,"12oz bottle into pint glass. Pours regal, rich, crystal clear golden color, with a minimal, disappearing white head. Continual rising bubbles reminiscent of champagne. Aroma of stale beer and sweet wine. Tastes like what it is - a hybrid. Blended so as to ping back and forth between beer and wine flavors.  Earthy herbaceousness from the saffron, juicy grapiness from the grapes. The honey seems to hold things together, and adds a touch of pleasant sweetness. The more I drink it, the more winey it tastes. Unique, but not as utterly strange as I was expecting or hoping for. Well done for what it is, I guess, and its pretty easy to drink...one. Alcohol warmth. Trying to remember if this is like a wine cooler. Not sure. A novelty and maybe something for the ladies, just not my cup of wierd.","Duluth, Georgia, USA","jcp23"

2593,"2007-05-04",3.9,"Pours a brilliant gold with a very thin white head that disappears quickly into a very tiny dots on the surface and a slight bead of white around the edge of the glass. The aroma is very fruity - like cider or fermented pears, white grape juice, and a good bit of alcohol. There is a slight acidic astringency in the aroma, too, as well as a touch of sweet honey. The flavor is quite crisp from the carbonation and the bite of alcohol. The tip of the tongue detects some acidity and some bitterness, but mostly a nice blend of malts and mead. The middle of the tongue picks up a good bit of body in the texture, more sweet malts and honey, and some fruit. My palate is not familiar with saffron, so that could be what I taste - but I would characterize it as a very interesting bitterness that is also fruity and floral. But perhaps that is from the muscat grapes, too. The finish is a little dry with an after-taste of honey and alcohol. Overall, a very pleasant experiement - but Im afraid its not as drinkable as the other Dogfish Head I picked up on the same day (the Raison DEtre).","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

DFH certainly gets creativity style points, though the Russian judge was particulaly harsh in scoring the technical aspects of the program.

A little frothiness and syrupy on the mouth with a slight carbonated ending.  While this beer is not for me, it does have a very interesting complex taste.

The saffron was fairly evident too. Lack of head took points off the appearance athough the sparkling clear golden color was quite impressive. Flavor was moderately sweet and lightly bitter to start and it was lightly acidic in the finish.

Fruity earthy-sweet aroma, perfumey, with notes of honey and orange, hawaiian bread and butter.  Flavor is sweet and dry, I get the comparison to a chardonnay, as its fruity, yet a bit tart, earthy and buttery with a pleasant bitter/astringent finish.  Medium to full body and creamy smooth carbonation.  Very interesting and quite tasty ale.","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"

The flavor is rather like a cross between a white wine and a dryish mead, but there is some beery malt taste as well. There are hints of honey and more than hints of a variety of spices I have difficulty identifying. Very unusual for a beer; more like a wine/mead cross with hints of beer, but quite complex and rather good.","Falmouth, Cornwall, ENGLAND","Delirium"

Surprisingly agressive taste... sweet and with hints of honey.  I can definitely see the similarities to a mead.  Peach and a little grape towards the finish.  Sweet, sticky finish.  Strong, but not so much as to be distracting.  Defintely out of the ordinary and I like it a lot!","oxford, Georgia, USA","Hangover"
2593,"2007-04-05",3.1,"UPDATED: SEP 12, 2008 Clear golden-burnt orange with medium head that lingers some. Aroma is white winish, grape alcohol, with some honeyed malt cereal, almost corn and lagerish. Initial taste does seem like a mix of a Dutch lager and a sweet white wine. Nice smooth palate is light-medium. Didnt really like at first, I think mainly due to the aroma, but the more I taste, the better it gets. Honey seems to be more present in a delicate aftertaste, along with some slight floral hops. Alcohol is smooth but present. Not an everyday beer (or wine?) but a nice change of pace.

2593,"2007-03-30",3.8,"Copper body. Diminutive light beige/off-white head. A thin veil of lacing prohibits a clear picture of the pretty colors. This really does have a distinguished look about it. Tempting aroma is incredibly sweet, with notes of honey, buttery white wine-washed oak barrels, lightly toasted grains that come in the form of sweet malts and Muscadine grapes. Flavor is incredibly sweet and approaches cloying, thankfully never bridging the gap between drinkable and sickening. Heavy maltiness in mid-mouthfeel. Finishes moderately tart with lingering bitterness. Palate is thick and moderately syrupy, very low acidity, warming. More tartness in the finish and greater carbonation would ring in a drastic improvement in drinkability. A very interesting and pretty tasty beer.

The aroma is interesting musty, almost meady, honey-laced and thick.  As I sip this, I am intrigued by this barrier-breaker ... its alcohol warmth reminds me of ice wine ... its got a big malty undercurrent that almost tastes like a big, thick malt liquor ... and it leaves a sweet honey-like glaze on my tongue like mead.  Interesting to be sure, but doesnt make me want to plop down $8 for a bottle again.  Id rather get a 4-pack of the 90-minute IPA.  Wonder how well Dogfish could do making a regular ol lager.

Flavor is heavy on the alcohol, with grapes and honey in the middle and finish, respectively. Palate is smooth but heavy, with some slight cloying from the honey at the finish.

The head settled down to a steady layer of foam, with a good deal of lacing.  The smell of the also seemed inspired by Belgian styles, as there was the noticeable saffron and spice presence, followed by the muscat grape smell, which is not too different than candi sugar.   The taste was sweet and light, which was different than most Belgians which generally tend to be a lot drier.  I could taste the sweet honey and white grapes, sense the floral delicateness of the saffron, and got a little hint of citric sourness at the back end of each sip.  Alcohol was evident in a warmth, but not abrasive.  Mouthfeel was light but sticky.  Different than most beers, but not as different as I was initially anticipating.

Aroma of sweet malt (probably due to the honey) is interesting and quite intriguing. Taste is very sweet with a champagne like feel with lots of fine bubbles. While this beer was quite sweet I never thought it was exceedingly so. The presence of Muscat grapes were well balance with the malt and the honey.

Medium, viscous mouthfeel: nice vinous character, honey and overripe grapes; chewy orange hop character underneath; light carbonation.  Reminds me more of a Muscat dAsti (obviously) or a Viognier wine moreso than Chardonnay, but in any event it finds a pleasant place for itself between beer and wine, and better composed than Chateau Jiahu.

This has got to taste better than that old horizontal I just rated. 12 oz brown bottle.  Pop the lid to observe an odd sour aroma. It also has the smell of saffron, I guessnever smelled saffron before.  Pour is orangy yellow in my stein and it is perfectly clear, no haze what so ever.  Kind of reminds me of a yuengling original lager. This beer has a taste that just cannot be enjoyed tho it is very different with lots of personality.  Reminds me a bit of King Lager with its industrialized behavior. I dont really see what is so midas about it. This is very unrefined and one must taste it to actually experience something so different in the beer arena. The only other traditioanal ale Ive had is poor Richards spruce by yards.  It tasted a little better but it was totally different than the flavor of this stuff.  Yes this tastes like a stronger King lager.  Same irascible aftertaste.  Will not buy this again.  Finish is not too bitter but it is something I dont look forward too after each gulp. In general, just plain old ruff stuff.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

Very light on the palate, this reminds me a little of a barleywine, but much lighter and less taste of alcohol, and a little of a chardonnay.  Fruity taste to be sure, quite an interesting taste.

The sour plays up again, it goes away, some sort of breadiness, then the dryness alternates with that light sweetness. The alcohol is noticeable.

2593,"2006-12-18",3.1,"Bottle. Lord, its been far too long since I even had a sip of beer. Im fighting some DTs to open up this one. I was afraid that my thoughts would be biased due to the overwhelming joy of finally sipping on sweet beer once again. However, the immediate first impression is not the best from this one.  I was expecting a dark, semi roasty, spiced ale, but truthfully, I never  know what DFH will come up with next.  The brew itself is gold and easily seen through while a bubbly white head floats on top. The aroma is slightly vegetal with a hint of corny pale lager type sweetness which made me slightly sad, but its not too bad all in all. A bit of dry, yeastiness comes out and adds a sweet, complex note. Hints of white wine and honey are noticed in the nose as well. Hm. The flavor is really not bad, I guess. Its much thinner than I was hoping, but does have a pleasing vinous honey finish that reminds me of a good mead. The alcohol is very well hidden. Slight earthiness and spiced bread round things out. Right before the lingering, pleasing mead-like qualities is a short phase that reminds me of a yellow lager but gets lost in the more exotic flavors. This is an interesting brew, but probably not one that I would get again. It fits well in DFHs catalogue of eccentric and unique brews. I could respect a more positive opinion of this, but I suppose it didnt quite cater to my personal tastes.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Still, far too fruity for me, even with the distinct barley aftertaste.  It had the distinct grape and honey flavor, which is not what I look for in a beer.  I dislike fruity beers.  Not as sweet as mead, not as fruity as wine, not bitter and hoppy enough to be a beer.  Felt like it didnt know what it wanted to be.

2593,"2006-10-22",3.7,"Oddly enough, this beer pours a GOLD color :)  Has a small head that sticks around for only about half the duration.  Aroma definitely has a honey presence, and some grapes along with a fruity tanginess.  It does remind me of mead.  Taste includes the same qualities, but with a deep caramel maltiness.  Finshes like brown sugar.  Definitely sweet, but not as extreme as some.  I started to eventually detect a wheat aroma in my nose after tasting.  Hmm.  I couldnt help but feel like this beer was missing an element (probably what hops are for) but that would miss the point of this beers agenda.

This started of a little sweeter than expected but as it warmed above 55 degrees it began to taste a little dryer and the alcohol became more prominent.

2593,"2006-08-03",3.6,"Appearance: This beer pours a golden orange, coopery color with a small - one pinky finger head. Clear. Highly carbonated. No Lacing. 

Smell: Very hidden subtle aroma. Sweet malts, honey and fruits, like grapes, show up more and more as the beer warms.

Taste: Very straight foreword. For a spiced beer it is NOT very spicy (which I am not complaining about because I dont like overkill but it was surprising). Simply sweet and malty. Hints of spices but overall very gentle to the palate.

Mouthfeel: Smooth. Thick and a bit sticky up front with a dry finish. Until it finishes warming to room temperature, then it is all sweet and smooth. ABV is completely hidden.

Drinkability: Truth is, I started drinking this beer, had about 2/3rds of it and set it aside. When I cam back to it, completely warmed to room temp, it was better than when I left it. IMO. I think the drinkability cold was a 3.5 and warm was a 4.5 so I suggest letting this one warm up.

Sharp and aggressive. The astringent pucker of grape sugar with a little bit of honey sweetness leads the attack. It leaves the mouth almost chalked (sepulchral?).

Springtime bouquet of ripened pear, canned apple sauce, honeydew, and green melon rind.  A thick, syrupy, vinous muscato blends with the light fruit perfumes quite well.  Thick, syrupy texture with only a small bit of sparkling effervescence dancing on the tongue.  A pleasant apple tartness leaps out right away, followed quickly by an oaky sweet pinot grigio.

As I sipped it further, I appreciated the hidden alcohol, the grape flavor beneath it hidden in the finish and the smooth sparkley palatte. This beer is a testament to the diversity of beer and how it can have flavors which diverge in numerous directions.

The flavor is equally complex: at first theres this bolus of sweet honey, then theres a strong muscatine grape flavor finally followed by a mild hop finish.

2593,"2006-02-11",3.3,"UPDATED: SEP 29, 2007 Beers with a touch of archaic tradition have always been alluring to me.  That, and to see one linked to a Hellenistic tradition makes for a shiningly unique beer.  As I understand it, Midas Touch was at least partially inspired, if not entirely, by the remnants of some dead royal fellows mug.  And that noble is none other than the fabled king of carats Midas himself.  The poor sot, as the story goes, was caught up in trying to feed himself, but kept turning his delicious repast into inedible, golden delights.  But it appears he was well provided for in the afterlife, outside of fiction and myth, that is.  If I were a member of an ancient civilizations royal council Id hardly think to put a mug of beer in my lieges coffin, but thanks to the stupendous ingenuity of one funereal attendant it happened.  After the archaeologists lifted the crypt cup from the earth they passed it along to experts who picked apart the blend of ingredients that would have made for Midas choice of drink.  And then Dogfish Head took up the Herculean job of reproducing it, all despite the potential set backs and the financial risk.  Although I dont appreciate the beer on the same level as our kingly posthumous host, I do appreciate Dogfish Heads mirthful twist on brewing.  The first pour of Midas Touch is an unexpected shock: it is by far the flattest beer Ive ever had.  No carbonation at all.  However, when I think about it, this is expected.  I doubt Midas had any contraption to fill a drink with fizz, and I also doubt anyone would be dumb enough to blow air through a straw into a keg for a good 3 months just to carbonate his majestys beer.  Corollary to the flatness is the lack of any head.  Indeed, the Midas Touch is as still and lifeless as a frozen lake on the Siberian Steppes.  Even so, the glacially still top faintly exudes an aroma of burnt honey, some light, bitter berries and a wee bit of toastiness.  And, unlike some mountebank beers I can think of, this is exactly what the beer tastes like, with the burnt honey sensation wresting control from the other flavors.  Overall a simple beer, from an era where beer had to be simple by the simple fact of missing some simple elements we simply take for granted today.  I do think its somewhat of a harsh drink, which may make it apt for the ruling monarch to have to give him a little gristle and toughness when the opulence of the royal life begins to soften him.  But the best quality of the beer here isnt actually the beer, but its origins.  Any inquisitive mind, whether it be scientific, historic, political, anthropological or sociological can find something to appreciate in downing a beer similar to, if not exactly like, the same brew that this heralded king of avarice and greed had.  Let us hope Midas Touch does not confer the same curse it is named after.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Theres also a bit of melon rind that comes forth and dominates the finish. A very complex ale. I can really distinguish the usage of muscato grapes. It gives it a melony character.

2593,"2006-01-28",3.8,"Man what an interesting beer. I became intrigued with it when I first read ""Brewing Up a Business"" and Sam talked about it there. Its fascinating. It has a Golden/Orange color, with a slight white head. Aroma is very familiar to white grape juice. Flavor is dry, grape, and spicy. Easily Id serve this to a winelover/beerhater and get them to change their mind.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","alaskanwarren"
2593,"2006-01-28",4.7,"Did beer really taste like this 2,700 years ago? If it did, I can tell you from drinking my first Phrygian cocktail 2,700 years later, it is great stuff. Dogfish head brews this special beer with malted barley, muscat grapes, and honey. I do not believe that they use hops in this beer, or if they do, hops are used only to balance the sweetness. This is a very sweet, and rich brew that I was very impressed with. For lack of a better word, it has the ""Midas Touch"". 

Midas Touch Golden Elixir pours to a beautiful, deep golden color with a slight white head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose on this beer is wonderful. Sweet aromas of malt and honey pair with a slight vinous note, and a back drop of peppery alcohol. The palate is rich and full, lots of sweet malt flavors, a touch of grape sweetness, and a pronounced honey character that is so delicious. This beer finishes with more honey/sweet malt flavors, and warms to a soothing burn. At 9% abv, this is a potent brew that is remarkably drinkable. 

It was pure bliss drinking this golden elixir, a beer fit for a king. This beer is packaged in a beautiful clear glass corked 750 ml bottle. It goes for about $12 a bottle, but for a beer as intriguing as this, I say it is well worth the money. It is also available in 12 oz 4 packs that go for about $9, and of course can be found on draught at the brewpub in Rehobeth Beach, DE. A wonderful sweet and honeyish beer that can stand alone, sip and savor this one folks, this is ""liquid gold"".","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Smell; this has a very vinous smell, that Im sure is from the grapes that this was brewed with. Theres also some some sweet malts and honey.

Taste; the honey and the grapes really stand out, and makes for a very sweet drink. Ive had saffron before, and I can detect a small amount in the taste, as well as a slight alcohol burn. This tastes more like a champagne, or sweet wine, than it does a beer to me. Given that, its still not bad, and is definitely one of the more unique beers that Ive had.

Definitely does taste like a mix between ale and white wine.  Not the best flavor in the world, but for such an experimental recipe, its pretty damn good.  The palate is medium bodied and smooth, with slightly bitter finish and an aftertaste that has a hint of vanilla.  Most of the overall points I give to this are for creativity.

You say Im biased when rating this beer, due to my experience last weekend, I will hear nothing of the such.  After a little calming down, there seems to be elegant notes of double bubble in the aroma of this beer.  Wooow! I havent even put this elixir to my lips yet and there is so much to say.  After a little more time and some more claming down, the first tastes of the beer offers over carbonation and a lingering acidic sweetness that seems out of place, but does slightly out way its counter part the ""Durango Ice"".  This consumer will admit to enjoy the delicate sweetness and white grape essence that lingers in the finish.  The body flows medium/thin with some residual sticky sweetness left on the lips and mouth.  The places this beer have taken me, its amazing, to swill and beyond.  P.S.

As expected, this beer proved particularly bizzare. Very different honey profile with several herbs lurking beneath the surface - the saffron comes across as something like jasmine or lavendar.  The ommision of a bittering agent occasionally proves slightly unsettling, the finish seems to be slightly unpleasant - sweet and just bizarre. Props for invention however.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"
2593,"2005-09-14",4.1,"This beer comes out of the bottle in your face.  The first swig is heavy, overpowering, sweet.  Other than the honey sweetness, the first thing I recognized with the muscat grapes.  I know that in Florida, at least, the muscat grape is an integral part of wine making.  It has its own sweet and dry qualities.  Once youve tried muscat juice straight up or wine derived from this grape you should have a decent sense of what to expect.  This is especially true on how this drink finishes: very mellow, a little sweet and a little dry, which is all in all a nice balance.  If this is what people used to drink back in the gold old days, then they were having a pretty good time.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Fantomas23"

Slightly hazed golden pour with only a trace of a white head, no activity.  Aroma is spicy and rich with honey, graham cracker, cinnamon, and some musty old grapes.  The yeast is bold and doughy and reminds me a bit of the Au Courrant in the way it blends with the grapes; this is not a bad thing as it seems to add a certain buttery-oak quality that I quite like.    The beer, despite a still appearance, is light and vibrant on the palate; the beer never becomes thick or cloying, it dances from salty up front to a tart-bitter finish.  Flavors of yesterdays wine reduced and spiced in the pan, fragrant even after the swallow.  Lingering sweetness of honeyed cereal.

Because it uses muscat grapes which are used for white wine and combines it with a belgian tasting yeast and malt,  you get an oak taste while eliminating the excessive sweet and sour taste of wine.  The grape, hops, malt, and yeast round out the beer giving the drinker the great sweetness of wine and the crisp bitterness of a malty ale.

Midas Touch is also very sweet and loaded with fruitiness but it is definitely ale.  Pours bright brassy gold with a fluffy head which quickly faded leaving some nice lacing behind.  Aroma was dominated by fruit esters, particularly blueberry, honey, sweet wine, yeast and malt.  Taste was a nice juxtaposition of sweet berries, toasty malt, and a good hop kick.  Whereas the malzbier was just syrupy sweet while this is a truly complex ale, slighty herbal but mostly sweet dextrose from the malt and a good bitter hop finish.  Dont think the saffron contributed.  This is refreshing and would go nice with a light desert as a digestif.","Toledo, Ohio, USA","noelcb"

The tail though has  a slight bitterness (not too bitter, but not as smooth for my own personal taste.)  This is hard to get a hold of.  I  heard that the taste of this one was actually made as a recreation of the mead that was found in King Midas goblet.

With sparse, yet steady rising bubbles. Head is white to slightly off-white. Starts out small and morphs into a ring around the edge of the glass. Very little lace. I immediately taste the saffron that is advertised on the bottle and am vindicated for identifying its taste in a select few other brews. Knowing the composition of this brew; white Muscat grapes, honey and saffron, delights my taste buds more than it they would have been otherwise. A little undercarbonated. I am very surprised that this is a 9% brew. Where my previous brew of the evening, Dark Horse Double Crooked IPA, tasted all and more of its 13.5%, this tastes much less than 9%. Its a nice brew, and one that I might have appreciated more not having preceded it with a Double IPA. I could seee this as a pretty good transitional brew for somebody who likes sweet malt brews.

2593,"2005-04-06",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2005 Deep golden honey and orange-toned body with abundant suspended particulates, visible viscosity, and a minimal white head that was reluctant to stand and faded fast. Interesting organic aroma of sweet, rich honey with floral and herbal notes. The nose has a quality that reminds me of poached pears. Initially comes across as very sweet, but some firm acidity and a subtle, but sharp bite of spice dries it out to a degree. Has some qualities of a bold white wine and a nice belly burn. Silky smooth fullness on the tongue, like warm syrup. An interesting and novel sipper. Amazingly, the distinct Dogfish Head signature still comes through. I would enjoy revisiting this from time to time, but the bottom-line is that, 9 times out of 10, Id rather drink a good mead than this. Still, I commend Dogfish Head for making this.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"

Ive had this a couple of times before and have finally decided to rate it.  Let the taste hit various parts of the tongue.  I get barley/grains at the back of the tongue.  Some sort of weird sweetness at the front.  Honey?  But from what flowers?  The aroma had kind of a heather honey scent.  I dont know what white Muscat grapes taste like...  saffron, hmm.

The ABV is well-hidden.  There was something about the beer that made me want to break out the swiss cheese -- it really made a good compliment, in a microbial extravaganza.

2593,"2005-03-03",3.9,"(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with shadey, thanks Shane!) There’s a lot of interesting stuff going on in this beer.  The beer starts off like a light barleywine, sweet and fruity, shows some maltiness like a doppelbock, and finally finishes like an Ethiopian honey wine.  I definitely taste the muscat grapes, but while I like dessert wines made from muscat grapes, they are possibly my least favorite of the dessert wines.  It’s all relative, of course!  I get some tartness overall, as well as a gentle, lingering bitterness in the finish as well.  The sweetness is a bit cloying after awhile, and the palate is a bit flat, but it has a very full and coating mouthfeel, so the overall palate resembles an inexpensive, one-dimensional dessert wine (i.e., lacking the balancing tartness).  The nose is like a sweet, lightly malty barleywine, but with honey.  Bright amber color, with a slightly hazy appearance.  Pours with pretty much no head, with just a thin rim of tiny bubbles forming around the edge of the glass.  This is certainly an interesting beer, quite enjoyable, but as much as I enjoy sweet alcoholic beverages like barleywines, dessert wines, ports and sweet sherries, I don’t think I could drink more than one bottle of this in an evening.  The finish needs a bit of tartness to balance the cloying sweetness to be able to drink multiple bottles in one sitting.  I think I’ll bring a bottle of this to my next wine tasting and see what my fellow wine enthusiasts think.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Easy to pick out the grapes in this one.   The first Dogfish Head that I havent flipped over. If all ancient ales were of this nature, Id have drank a lot less beer had I lived in those times.

Palate is a bit thin yet crisp. Again, its like a carbonated Chardonnay. Overall, its definately worth a try as its different from most anything else youve had. This will never be a ""go to"" beer for me, but its a great change of pace.

Before even reading the label, I told the bartender that this tasted like Scuppernong grapes (also known as Muscadine), a big fat grape with a huge seed grown around here - sure enough, the label says it is made with Muscat grapes which Im sure somewhere down the line is a third cousin or something in the grape family. 9% ABV is tasted and felt, not distracting. Some hints of honey in there as well. Mouthfeel is thick, oily and creamy with some warming alcohol notes. A different brew, something you would expect from DFH.

This definitely goes from good to exceptionally good as it increases in temperature. You get a whole new taste with the complexities of sweet and sour from the grapes, the subtle alcohols and their syrupy dryness. The sticky mouthfeel of the honey is very pleasant. Long lasting thick sticky mouthfeel. This almost has some serious mead like qualities to it. Very sweet, sticky and sour...but not overly so.... theres somethiong about the sticky honey here that just keeps me coming back for more.

Aromas are of grapes, saffron, floral honey, slight malts, and alcohol. No hops aromas here gang. Flavors are of white grape juice, honey, and spices. Warming to the stomach when swallowed. Aromatic and very complex. The honey notes are pronounced and make up the bulk of flavors, along with the grape juice. Sweet, but not cloying. The extended aging of this sample has provided a depth of character that can not be achieved in a fresh sample. The flavors have melded and become a total greater than the sum of its parts. It is truly a beverage to savor, and also to age. I believe an even more extended aging period would do wonders for this beer. Thick mouthfeel and sweet character make for an interesting experience. Im glad I aged this one for a year.","","Cobra"

Nice golden color with a thick head that slowly dissipated, then coated the glass as I drank.  A winey taste, probably cause of the grapes n honey.  Not sure what the saffron did, except add color.  (Usually, it only appears on southern styled rice in my home.)  Syrupy.  Malt comes through.  Nice flavor.

The alcohol and grapes come on halfway through taking away some of the sweetness, but certainly not dulling the flavor.  Very warming, strong and IMO, good.

Big surprise, let's see what else is in here.  A sweet but firm biscuit taste and also a lot of grapes (again, big surprise).  I know nothing about varietals, but this is a very juicy beer.

Aroma is pleasant sweetish honey but perhaps a little faint and in IMHO the weakest feature of this beer. Palate is medium bodied and really smooth and low carb considering the ongoing visible carbonation.  Flavours are clearly fresh honey based with added interesting woody vinous overripe white grape yeastiness. With all these sweet flavour contributors this beer still generates plenty of balancing dryness. Superb alcohol masking only really evident from the ear afterglow. OK - it maybe brewed to impress the Chardonnay set and the commercial description of being based on something found in a tomb is corny to to say the least, but being a lover of sweet fortified wines this one really struck a chord with my sweet wine tooth.

2593,"2004-04-18",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2004 This beer is produced based on ingredients found in an ancient tomb. A couple things though: ancient beer wasn't carbonated (this wasn't begun until sometime in the 1800's), nor did they have Thermos mugs to keep it cool. Therefore, in rating this beer I did what in other cases would be unthinkable: I poured most of it into a glass and let it sit overnight at 80 degrees fahrenheit such that it lost the carbonation and was in a form more analogous to how beer would have been drunk in 700 b.c. The result was surprising -- compared to drinking it cold out of a newly opened bottle, the warmed, tempered form was quite thirst-quenching on a hot humid day, as opposed to a weird, cloying grittiness in drinking it straight out of a cold bottle. The brew possesses the color of the honey used in its manufacture. It's aroma is powerful -- it really seems like something based in antiquity. Even more than in its cold form, the taste of the alcohol was barely noticeable in the warm form; yet its extremely smooth, watery texture is balanced by an extreme herbal complexity. If you've had this cold, I'd highly recommend trying it warmed without carbonation. UPDATE: Even more strongly, I would recommend this outfit make a version of this without carbonation; most of us have had plain soda water and realize that the carbon itself imparts a great effect on overall flavor, even if it's lost its fizz - in seeking a more definite realism, the taste of a carbonated beverage is quite incompatible with production methods of that era.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","BeerAteHer"

Alcohol is numbing on the tongue, full bodied w/ low carbonation, and very smooth.  Lacks a little complexity and malt character IMHO for a big beer, but very tasty and drinkable.

Aromas of acid, grape, wine, musty, sweet, and malt are all in here.  It is a bit sweeter in the taste than the aroma suggests.  There is no balancing bitterness that one usually finds in a beer, Fruity, but more like fresh grapes than wine.  The malt comes through towards the end of each sip but it is in this beer.  I cannot say that I am able to pick up any of the delicate honey character, it probably contributes to the sweetness but the other flavors dominate.  This beer has a good fresh grape character to it which makes it quite pleasant to drink.  There is a soft acidity here (perhaps grape derived), but it is not quite enough to balance out the sweetness.  Perhaps there is a bit of stale malt flavors in the finish.

Pours orangey color, rather clear, a fairly big white head that collapses entirely and fades away rapdily.  Aroma was very mead-like, honey everywhere.  Taste was bizarre, one of the few DFH beers where you could really pinpoint most of the ingredients.  Up front the flavor is almost like a beer mixed with some white wine notes.  This rapidly descends into the mead flavor, quite sweet.  At the end, the saffron comes in rather strongly, leaving that sort of haunting, full flavor that saffron does with rice in a top-notch paella.  Really weird to have a beer ""hopped"" with saffron.

But upon opening it is when it really starts to shows off. Color is a hazy dark yellow with a light orangy gold tone to it. Recieved a big bubbly off-white head of foam that faded pretty quickly leaving amazing stitching of lace all over the glass. Smell is much that of wine, chardonnay maybe, with lots of white grapes, a bit musty in a earthy undertone and just lots of fruity sweetness and a touch of honey. Taste is mild sweetness of grapes, wine-like in character, good fruity sweet tartness that grabs nicely and is easy to handle with a nice ""touch "" of honey and some alcohol pops out in the finish. Feel is pretty full, a bit dull of sweet tartness and carbonation is leveled out some.

Nose: very spicey - possibly saffron, but also coriander, gingerbread, galangaroot, Szechuan pepper (='Farchiew powder').
Taste: very spicey again, spicey-bitterish and sweet at the same time. Definitely gingerish or galanga-ish taste. Also taste of gingerbread-preserved orange (peel?). No flavour of grapes detectable in this bottle. Very remarkably NO difference in taste and aftertaste; no specific retronasal aromas.
Mouthfeel: thinner than ABV and composition would suggest. This beer is quite refreshing, which is possibly its main surprise. Alcohol is however very detectable in finish.

The off-white small head is frothy and recedes in short order.  King Midas must have been a bitch, because the brew is sweeter than anything I have sampled to date.  However, much to the credit of the brewer, much depth and complexity is present and pronounced.  The long deep, spicy, and sour finish is tainted with alcohol sweetness.  The medium body is creamy and lively.  The finish feels very alcoholic and slightly sticky.  I feel like I did after tasting my first (and to date still the best) Dortmunder (from Great Lakes Brewing).  I experienced an explosion of flavor unlike anything I have previously had.

Not bad but an odd combination.  A little too much going on here.  Smells of alcohol and honey, tastes of beer up front with saffron and alcohol following into tart grapey aftertaste.  Dry finish, not much of a head, which you might expect of a concotion of this nature.  I agree with scrawfis, it is not bad in small quantities but a whole bottle could prove taxing.

The honey aroma is pleasant, and it comes through in the flavor a bit.  There isn't quite enough going on in this beer to hide the alcohol well, so it still retains that antiseptic quality, despite its sweeter undertones.  Not terrible, but not great either.  [Re-rate, original 3.2]  I don't know if anything has changed since last I had this (besides the bottling), but I like it much better now.  The sweet, mead-ish qualities are evident - the alcohol is perfectly masked now, and the muscat grapes really come through in the flavor, as well as in intense grainy flavor in the finish, along with the saffron surging through at the very end - this is a great and original beer from a great and original brewery.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

2593,"2002-08-21",3.9,"The alcohol comes through on this as does the honey and muscat, i couldnt quite pick up the saffron, even though Im not sure i could if it were more pronounced anyway.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","dirtymike"
2593,"2002-07-29",4.4,"Nice honey and floral nose, alcohol. Golden honey color with little head but a bit of lacing. A champagne fizziness - light and vibrant. Medium-light body with an alcohol burn. Tastes of honey and beeswax. Sweet and alcoholic, herbs. Complex and vapory. Pleasing after of beeswax and bread. Really like this beer.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"

2593,"2002-07-15",3.2,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2003 Head is initially small, fizzy, white, fully diminishing. Body is dark yellow. Aroma is moderately malty (cookie,
light bread), with notes of apple, grape, apricot, and honey. Flavor is heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is
moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Medium body, syrupy
texture, lively carbonation, lightly alcoholic. Interesting/different,
nice fruity aroma, but a little too syrupy sweet to be drinkable.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2593,"2002-07-14",3.6,"Cloudy golden. Medium head with little retention. A very cidery, tripel-like aroma. The flavor is very complex. Cidery, spicy, sweet with honey, a bit of a winey feel to the body. However, I occasionally get this strange burst of sweatsocks in the flavor. Now I cant say Ive ever eaten sweatsocks but I imagine thats what the flavor would taste like. A very intersting beer from by far the worlds most intresting brewery.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Jake Barnes"

2593,"2002-07-04",3.7,"very intresting. white grapes definatly make there preasance known and dominate the flavor. however the barley and honey can still be tasted. very dry aftertaste. very much like a wine with a dry after taste but also very much like an ale in the initial tase. all in all this is pretty good","Ohio, USA","gerdy555"
2593,"2002-07-03",4.4,"I am pleased. More meadish in the nose, some plums -- this is very different. Some mild cider hues, delicate, remarkably clean, soft and round. Pretty floral aromas. More vinous at 56.5°F. Commands attention though its an easy drinker.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
2593,"2002-07-01",4.4,"Walk like an egyptian.  This is one crazy drink.  Representing tastes of muscat grapes, grain and wheat give this ale a plum wine smell and a light mead taste.  Good stuff for an ale that is older than your mummy (ouch).","San Francisco, California, USA","MrDick"
2593,"2002-07-01",4.5,"Very interesting. Sort of a dry, extremely vinous flavor, with fewer rough edges than I had expected. It wouldnt surprise me if the original funerary beer had a more funky lambic-like yeast; nevertheless this is a superb beverage, well worth seeking out on its inherent merits in addition to the hstorical connection.","Schnecksville, Pennsylvania, USA","Admiral"
2593,"2002-07-01",2.3,"UPDATED: JAN 11, 2004 Pours a clear orange color, with a small head.  Aroma much like a fruity barleywine.  The taste is complex and sweet with a light fruity/honey mixed in with the spices.  High ABV is noticeable after swallowing.  While unique and interesting, this isn't something that I would go back to. The 750ML bottle is just too big, personally I would have been happier if this came in 7OZ bottles.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"

2593,"2002-06-20",3.2,"This brew, part of a fine trade with High Gravity, is most remarkable for how evenly it distributes its triumvirate.  It is not hard to pick up maltiness, honey sweetness, and the muscatel.  Myself, I wish they had gone for a dryer effect - the best meads IMO, are those with the taste of honey but little to none of the sweetness, and though there is a touch of dry stab at close, the brew is dominated by heavier, sweeter action, like the sweet drowsiness of a humid June day as the cottonwood seeds float languidly down.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"

2593,"2002-06-15",3.5,"Very sweet: the grapes and honey dominate. Noticeable alcohol presence, but not offensively so. According to an article I read about the inspiration for this, um, beverage, there were 100 gallons of (something like) this and 100 iron cups at King Midass funeral. My, they must have been wasted.","Buffalo, New York, USA","estoppel"

2593,"2002-06-02",3.5,"Sweet and tangy.  Can taste the honey and get a sense of grapes.  Dark gold to copper in color with a small head.  Dogfish has a real original here.","Virginia, USA","PTomkinson"
2593,"2002-05-26",3.9,"copper colour with a thin head that left a surprising amount of lace.
grapes are apparent in the nose along with citrus and some spice notes. interesting taste  very light yet with lots of subtleties - a cross between a saison and a belgian strong ale.
the honey gives this a slightly sweet syrupy flavour  but it has enough fruit and spicing to make it an easy drink
smooth creamy body and a long lsting aftertaste.
would make a great desert beer.","Bombay, INDIA","ravidesai"

Made me remember a time when I got sick off a bottle of Maddog when I was 16...not a good memory.  I dont think this is a mead and it certainly will NOT intrigue a Chardonnay or IPA drinker.  The worst Dogfish has to offer.","Roanoke, Virginia, USA","beerstop"
2593,"2002-04-25",4.1,"Like many things from DFH, I have no idea how they thought this one up.  Very interesting.  From the description, was expecting a wine-like beverage; poured to a golden, hazy yellow with a good head, looking like a pils or lighter ale.  Very wine-like flavors, but a strong, nutty undercurrent runs through this one.  I rarely enjoy honey in brews, but the chardonnay-like qualities of this one made the sweetness quite pleasant.  Im starting to believe the people at Dogfish Head are absolutely insane, but in a good way.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"

2593,"2002-03-17",3.1,"Quite possibly a glimpse into what was being drank 2,700 years ago... very interesting in that respect. Sudzy white head, hazy amber color. Wine-like nose. Starts chewy, soft & smooth - heavy on the tongue. Finishes spikey and tingly, with a wine-like dryness. Saffron is delicately in the background. Only some mild bitterness. Some alcohol detected - after a few sips - in the background; nice and warming, masked well. For more information on the background of this beer, check out All About Beer Vol. 22 No. 1 of March 2001. But I feel sorry for people in those days - sans hops! I could never get into a virtually hopless beer. And it was difficult to rate this beer per style. As a Mead, possibly, but its really Ancient. Who knows... maybe they had a style for it called Akynayooboo... for all we know.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
2593,"2002-02-18",4.8,"Very tasty.  Part Belgian blonde ale, part Ethiopian honey wine, and part chardonnay.  I drank it at about 45 degrees, and it worked well.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","booyaatribe"
2593,"2001-12-03",2.9,"In keeping with DFH tradition, this was very unique.  For starters, I chilled it too long - which turned out to be a good thing.  The first sip was incredibly winey, similar to an inexpensive semi-dry Chardonnay with the aroma to match.  As it warmed slighty, mead aromas and flavors became more prominent.  It finished a bit like a bock and was vaguely reminescent of Sam Adams Winter Lager, only not quite as tasty.  Again, this was very unique and Im happy I experienced it, but I would not buy it again.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

Grapes are difinetely present, but so is a nice spiciness I guess from the saffron. The head was thick but dissipated quickly. We drank it at around 60*F and I copuld tell that this benefited it greatly. I would drink this again in a heartbeat just to be able to ponder all the different flavors.","Richardson, Texas, USA","legion242"

I had the corked version which seemed creamier and the same size bottle with a cap that was not as creamy.  I dont think a cork would influence it that much since it isnt bottle conditioned and they were probably from the same batch.  I dont know, but I did taste a difference.  Winey, appetizing and enjoyable with a good friend or a Johhny Cash CD.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

2593,"2001-10-31",4.1,"Cold it had a definite grape flavor with noticeable honey notes and some saffron flavor as well. Bubbly, which kept the sweetness and ABV from overwhelming. Nice creamy head with loads of Brussels lace. The flavor was outstanding and reminded me of 3 Monts, in body and flavor. It was creamier and a little sweeter once warm but I thoroughly enjoyed every drop of this liquid gold. Nicely done.","Connecticut, USA","VENOM"

2593,"2001-09-22",4.0,"Putting the ridiculous legend of this beer aside, on its own, this is still rather good.  The appropriate adjective to describe each of this beers qualities is sweet.  Flavors consist of candy cherry and honey, with a complimentary grape tartness.  Golden blond with a persistent white head, the aroma also consists of sweet grape and cherry with a sweet, malt and subtle yeast finish.  While the story might intrigue you, the quality will entice you.  Can Dogfish Head do any wrong?","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
2593,"2001-09-11",4.2,"Since i love sweet things this beer actually appealed to me.  Very strong, sweet honey flavor as well as a tangy grape taste. Packs a punch but is worthwile to split a large bottle with a friend, which i did not do. By the end of the bottle, as it warmed a fair amount, the sweet taste became a little too overpowering for my palate.","Jeannette, Pennsylvania, USA","dolemike1"
2593,"2001-09-10",3.5,"Interesting.    The aroma was very fragrant and filled the room upon opening the attractive bottle.   It had the perfume of fruit .   The beer poured producing a robust thick head with soon dissipated into a clingy lace.    The color was amber leaning toward yellow.  The taste was very complex.   Hints of grapes were definately present , hence the description by others as being whiney.    This beer was on the sweet end.   It was unusual in that the hops were missing yet the saffron provided a unique spicy twist.    A notable effort and  worth a try for those wishing to sample a really unique concoction.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","lizziesage"
