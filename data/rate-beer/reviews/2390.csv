2390,"2016-03-20",3.7,"Aroma like a super classical imperial ipa. Very hoppy very malty. Cant feel the red part of it. It is amber color, hazy. In taste is much worse than in aroma. It feels flat and quite boring. There is red part of it, its a bit caramel front, but thats quite all. After few more sips its starting to be quite like in aroma. Medium mouthfeel, perfect level of carbonation. Its ok, but must admit - I was expecting much more.","Poznan, POLAND","adasko"

Caramel is there but melds with dried apricots, lychees, kumquat. Pine tingles underneath. Some pepper. Dries out a bit with creeping bitterness, just a little heat at the end.

2390,"2014-07-11",4.2,"At just on cool and into a snifter it pours with little oomph and settles headless bar a few yellow islands of suds. Oily legs grip the glass as it is swirled about. Body is almost still; a mistily hazy tawny copper in colour. Big, bold hops on the nose. Resinous, sappy, whole pine-forest that oozes with so much candied citrus, camphor, eucalypt and rose water musk - divine! Big bodied, meaty and chunky malt driven start with a powerful punch of resinous, herbaceous hops in the back. Piney, twiggy, bitter end before a lengthy, HOT alcohol finish that ties in nicely. Bitter, weedy, rose musk linger on the palate offsets the sweetness of crystal and toasted malts, and the juicy, grapefruit and orange esters that come through. Quite oily in the finish; with a peppery carbonation that manages to lift it. This is a monster of a beer. Hard hitting and full, but oh so balanced and in line as to be sessionable and approachable. I love it. Pour me another!! (33cL, BB 18/08/14, The Liquor Shed, Jandakot)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"
2390,"2014-06-13",3.7,"Bottle from Mane Liquor. Pours dirty amber with a beige head. Nose is full of sweet tropical fruits, especially lychee and pine with heavy apricot. Great malt backing here without overpowering the tropical hops. Heaps of lychee and grassy hops with mild pineapple. Very fruit driven stuff with a nice caramel dose behind it all. Aggressively sweet but balanced well. I like it","Perth, AUSTRALIA","maneliquor"

2390,"2013-06-30",3.3,"A reasonably Light Amber Ale, mid-range cloudiness giving the impression of fullness which is always appealing. Taste wise was a little bit of a let-down compared to the look of the beer. I thought it would be a little bit more of a mouthful, but still a very nice ale. Quite dry with the bitterness aftertaste not lasting too long, but with s good smell through the nose once swallowed.
The head resided quite quickly so not too gaseous.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","NLawrence03"
2390,"2013-06-25",3.7,"Lord knows I love an amber ale. This one tended to the darker side becoming almost tawny in appearance with a minimal head from gas pourage. Would I wouldnt give to have had this a bit warmer on handpull. The smell of this beer was fairly restrained, given the serving temperature, but discernible was spruce and resin, chipped redwood and peachy tart. Those flavours were abundant too in a fullish sort of body with tingly mouthfeel. The bitterness wasnt overwhelming but was definitely there giving the impression of a silky, elegant but chewable beer. Lovely. Just lovely.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"
