1273,"2015-03-10",3.5,"On tap poured into a shaker. The aroma is caramel and bread. It pours an oily, orange copper color with a gelatin soft, off white head retaining a thin ring and light, dusty surface that leaves a good sheet lace. The beer is lightly bitter with a rich medium sweet. The beer is syrupy, but thinnish, and smooth, with a soft, creamy carbonation. The medium body is bready and citrusy with undertones of caramel. It finishes with citrus and toffee leaving a waxy, astringent aftertaste thats bitter with bread crust and citrus peel.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"
1273,"2015-03-08",2.9,"On tap at the downtown brewpub. Clear golden with nice off-white head. Aroma is grain, light body, medium carbonation, and sparse small-bubble lacing. Taste is light grain with light hop backbone.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"
1273,"2013-03-01",4.6,"I dont even like the style...but this is fantastic. Granted it is a very Americanized version of the British style, but I feel it has finally been done right.","","bobark"
1273,"2012-06-25",3.6,"Poured on draft. Hazy gold to copper color with a sticky white head of foam. Aroma is a a nice mix of citrus fruity bitterness, and a caramel  malt backbone. Taste is mildly earthily bitter. Not bad.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
1273,"2011-03-06",2.5,"On tap at Barleys Ale House #1, Columbus OH, on 12 March 2010. Amber colour. No head. Very little condition. Sweetish. Lots of caramel malt character. Also had some sour notes and a little toilet cleaner / bleach. Not very impressed. A bit sickly. I wonder whether this was a bit stale as other reviews seem very positive. In fact, although I didnt note it at the time I suspect this was actually from a cask that was past its best. Will try again if I ever get back to Barleys.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"
1273,"2010-04-13",3.3,"On tap at the Alehouse. Pours a clear reddish copper with a medium beige head. Light aroma of English malt and dank earthy hop. English malt flavor with caramel and a semi-bitter finish.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
1273,"2008-10-06",3.2,"Objectively speaking:
An alright ESB which I was sure I had mistaken for another when I saw this was one of the USA’s ahemm... the world’s highest rated.

I like:
I must say it was possibly the finest glass I had at Barley’s number 1. Nize hazy orange looks. Fitting very lightly carbonated texture. Good balance between sweetness and dryness.

I dislike:
Quite one-dimensional, soft and citrusy flavours (think orange) with gentle earthiness from the English hops. Juicy, yet with fair growing bitterness. Quite fresh, but not particularly inspiring, lacking any real fruity developments and avoiding the whole toasty range.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

1273,"2008-03-03",4.0,"Cask, alehouse.  Pours a deep amber color with a nice compact, cask-aled white head.  Aroma is fruity, floral hops perfectly integrated with a nice deep maltiness underneath.  Everything about this beer is nicely balanced, including the aroma.  Taste is sweet yet bitter, fruity and hoppy though strongly malty.  Very nice creamy mouthfeel.  Drinkability is extremely high - I could drink this all night.  The cask fits this beer extremely well.  Great.","Portland, Oregon, USA","DrHomolka"

Well balanced flavor of malt and hops with a medium bittersweet finish of moderate duration. This is a standout ESB brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"

1273,"2006-04-25",3.6,"Sampled from a growler shared by kp: Lightly sweet grainy caramel malty aroma has some light floral English hoppiness and mild peat.  Pours a clear effervescent light copper bronze with a nicely-lacing frothy white head.  Body starts with a grainy earthy toasted malty sweetness nicely-balanced with a floral English hoppy bitterness.  A nice, true to style ESB.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
1273,"2006-03-21",3.7,"Growler @ KPs Cellar.  Poured a clear copper color with a medium off-white head.  Aroma of caramel, toffee, and light earthy hop on the back.  Notes of apple flesh when it browns.  The flavor is sweet and malty at the start and gives up some fruit in the middle.  Pleasant long bitter finish.  Light-medium bodied.  I would have to say this is a pretty good beer.  Especially since I dont care for this style much.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
1273,"2006-02-18",3.8,"Had this from the firkin last night.  Nose of alcohol, medicine & spice.  Floral and resinous tones also accompanied fruity and caramel tones as brew warms.  Pours a hazy medium amber not unlike iced tea.  No head.  Exceptional balance and complexity.  A near perfect cornucopia of palatable pleasure.  The medium creamy body is very silky.  Very well done.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"
1273,"2005-07-18",3.9,"On tap at Alehouse #1 - Pours copper with a decent offwhite head.  Nice aroma of hops and caramel malts.  Nice and hoppy upfront lends way to the sweet caramel malts behind it.  On the palate this is medium bodied and smooth and buttery on the tongue and a nice balanced brew.  Very tasty and worth trying.","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"

1273,"2004-07-20",3.4,"Fruity sweet malty aroma in this deep orange/red brew.  Colors nice, but very little head and lacing.

1273,"2003-11-19",3.9,"On tap: Amber hue with a small frothy head and some lace. Aroma hints of fruit (cherry and apple), aromatic hops, hint of pine, and nutty malts. The taste had a real nice fruity character with good balance of malts and traditional hops. Mild bitter finish with a buttery and creamy mouthfeel, a touch dry. This is a top-notch ESB, easy to drink yet complex enough for the beergeek.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Robert Burns Dinner &
Robert Burns Scottish Export Ale Tapping Jan 25th. Named after the brewmaster at Barley's Smokehouse, you have to be pretty sure of the quality of something to name it after yourself. This is a very good ESB. Dark orangish-brown with a medium off-white head and some lacing. Aroma of floral hops with a little sweet malt thrown in for balance. Flavor is nicely bitter with a great sweet touch at the end. I'm sorry I went so long without trying this.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

1273,"2002-11-12",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2003 This is the ESB that got me addicted to ESB's!
Re-Rate from Robert Burns Dinner
This has been picked to go to Chicago. Good choice.
Pours a dark golgen color with a thin white head. Some lacing.
Smells very floral. Lots of delicate hops in the nose.
Malt backbone really shines through in the taste. Hops counters the maltiness very well. The best their ESB has been so far...
Smooth but a bit too fizzy.
Going to bump my original 'Overall' from 17 to 18.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bender"

It is a deep amber color with a nice fragrance to it. Not much of a head. Nice finish to this beer. A slight astringent aftertaste to this brew which is good for this style.","Ohio, USA","Gunshy"
