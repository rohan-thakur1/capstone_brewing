Jag har så många öl att betygsätta avyer en stor åldrig öldrinkning med min goda vän Jesse, att jag inte har tid att betygsätta alla dessa och i många fall hade för öl att minnas storheten i dessa öl. Till ära för mitt svenska arv, jag skickar detta på svenska för alla recensioner från den dagen. Tack Gud för god öl !!

654,"2017-04-28",3.9,"0.75l bottle shared with The Tasting Crew. Been looking forward to this one. It pours a deep dark brown, near black body in the glass and it has a medium sized slowly sidesticking an islandy beige head. Lovely nose. Woody and vanilla infused for sure. I get chocolate, some dark sweetness soaked rum raisins. Malt spicy drops. Cinnamon spicy almost and traces of whisky. Smells really good. It tastes quite good, I have to say. More woody and vanilla infused in the taste actually. Feels thick and oily on the mouthfeel and the about average on the carbonation. A little chocolate with dark caramel and dry licorice.

654,"2015-06-17",4.0,"September 12th, 2013 - The Wee Heavy occupies a wee space in my heart. AleSmith sometimes feels like the last tattered bastion for dark brews in San Diego. When I heard they brewed a batch in bourbon barrels, I knew I need to try a sip, or ideally more than just a sip. Its like seeking medicine after weeks and months of IPAs, hoping to slake my thirst for the deep, dark stuff. The bourbon aged version of the Wee Heavy is about on par with the original in appearance. It looks like a cloudy soda, with big, frog-eye bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass near the top. But the aroma makes it clear that this is not the same beer as before. Immediately I recognize (compelled to recognize) that this is punchy brew, strong and heavily laced with bourbon notes. Its tough, redolent, but not too sharp or raw. Theres refinement in there, like the $30 plus bottles one buys to impress a father figure. Also in there are notes of old houses, old furniture, wood, and malt. Theres beer in there, but its staring back at me with a heavy, leather and antique mask. The body is sudsy and medium in weight - not too sharp, not too loud. It takes awhile for the booze to settle in, and once it does, those bourbon notes dominate. But then subtler tastes of Scotch and peat mingle with the bourbon, creating a new and intoxicating harmony. When the dark malty notes pike on, this beer turns into a warm, smoothing and relaxing brew, delivering heady and aged alcoholic notes all the way to a low grumbling and murmuring aftertaste. Its a decidedly different beer than the raw Wee Heavy, but well worth the expense. All thats left is finding a cabin in the forest to pair this with.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining a thin cap. Aromas of big caramel, toast, toffee, brown sugar, raisin, prune, fig, date, licorice, light chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, light butterscotch/coconut/leather, and toast/oaky earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. A fair amount of noticeable alcohol, but subsides as it reaches room temperatures. Taste of big caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, raisin, plum, fig, date, licorice, light chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, light butterscotch/coconut/leather, and toast/oaky earthiness. Light amount of tannic oak bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, raisin, plum, licorice, light chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, oak, light butterscotch/coconut/leather and oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a great malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very smooth and moderately creamy/slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an awesome barrel aged scotch ale style. All around great complexity and balance of dark/bready malt, fruity yeast, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

The biggest complaint I have about this is that the booze dominates the base beer and I miss the subtleness of smokiness, peatiness, and caramelization from a scotch ale.

Anyway, appearance: similar in color, but somewhat darker head that dissipates quickly to no head. Aroma: rather similar, but with lots of vanilla and bourbon. The few hops that were present are now stale/old, but in a good way. More dark fruits as well. So basically more of everything except hops and toast. A bit sweeter. Palate: wow, even smoother than the original, which is impressive. Smooth and sexy with medium-full body and gentle carbonation. More raisins, plums, and just keeps getting better and better throughout the glass. I would have missed out on a lot of this if I just had 4oz I think.

On the palate, it is medium-full in body with a smooth creamy texture and soft carbonation. Overall this is an amazing and truly exceptional beer. The most complex, elegant scotch ale on the market. Elegant, perfect, balanced, complex. Wow. 2013-07-25","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"

654,"2013-11-25",4.2,"Aged 3 years (2010 vintage): This awesome concoction of yumminess is dark brown in color with a small, medium-brown colored head, a little thin in appearance. The aroma is nice and very soft, almost reminiscent of cherries. It smells much like a thinned out (or aged) Wee Heavy with some cherries sticking their heads out from beneath the surface. A good level of potent alcohol is present, but its not overpowering. The flavor will knock your socks off. Its sweet and fruity with an almost tart character. Its amazingly enjoyable, really super fruity, but with some respectable hair on its chest. Its quite delicious with definite currants, cherries, and alcohol flavors, with some peat character surfacing after a while. It ends with a glorious, tart, fruity finish. This is fantastic.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

654,"2011-12-15",4.3,"750 ml bottle from lushawn as a wedding gift- thanks, Shawn! Bottle #552/972. 2009 vintage. Those facts were apparently written in ballpoint pen. This is the last of the four bottles Shawn gave us for the wedding, sadly. But its a big one! Pours a deep, dark brown color, hazy and opaque in the center but clear amber on the edges, with almost no head, just a small brown ring. Aroma of bourbon, caramel, vanilla, and oak make their way through the complex Wee Heavy base of dark and dried fruits, toasted, dark, and sweet malts, and some of that Scotchy, peaty earthiness. The flavor actually shows more of the dark fruits than the nose, along with peat, caramel and toasted malts, chocolate, oak, and as it warms more bourbon, vanilla, and toffee. Medium-bodied, definitely thinner than the Wee Heavy, with low carbonation and a rich, fruity mouthfeel that becomes sweeter and stickier on the finish. Really awesome BA version of one of my favorite Wee Heavy beers. AleSmith knows how to do barrels, thats for sure.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

Flavor is less harsh and reminds me a bit of what I love from the regular Wee Heavy: notes of rum, caramelized sugar, and toffee. Nice flavor notes are somewhat ruined by a syrupy booze finish. Some nice rum and caramel notes in the finish are masked by harsh alcohol burn, and the sweetness itself goes over the top. I know Im in the minority, but for me this is a prime example of barrel aging ruining a perfectly phenomenal beer. I mean, I love Alesmith Wee Heavy.

Well integrated Barrel character in this one. Pours a chocolately brown with a tan creamy head. Nose is light vanilla and cocoa with a fullness to it. Not roast so much as really good chocolate. Clean. Bourbon is subdued overall. On taste, it seems to have lost a touch of the creaminess that has been replaced by an almost savory tobacco quality.

A strong ABV element comes into play with wet oak, big vanilla tannins. Hot and sweet, but dried out by the barrel a bit, hot and loaded with barrel tannins. Into the end, more red fruit, caramel, vanilla. Big wet oak and some hot spirit, some more cellar time could do it some good. But overall, a strong and assertive beer.

Pours a moderately-dark brown color with a single-finger tan head and a bit of light lacing and a thin collar. Nose brings quite a bit of caramel, barrel character, dark fruits, and some more bourbon. A bit of booze, though its quite welcome in the state its in.

Flavor is really quite exceptional with a really nice barrel character. Really smooth and mellow. Beautiful warmth in the finish coming from the alcohol. Slight sweetness comes alongside the dark fruit character. Medium body and quite complex. Good carbonation. Ive been waiting quite a long time to try this one, and it certainly was not a disappointment.

654,"2011-03-31",4.3,"Bottle shared by Brad at a recent tasting, 2006 vintge. About 250 of these were bottled, Im super honored to get a pour of this. Beer is dark brown and pretty hazy with a thin off white / tan head of small and medium bubbles. Agitation coaxes a decent head out of the beer but it does not have good staying power, minimal lacing.

Aroma is very bourbon filled. Its sweet and has some herbal spice to it but mostly liquor. Smells awesome honestly, exactly what I hoped it would smell like.

Beer is medium bodied and really creamy. There is minimal peat in the mid-palate and rounds out nicely to finish the beer. The lead off is a little sweet and very bourbon-y. It is not very hot, just a nice beer all around. The flavors walk that line between tasting like liquor and being liquor. I would have more of this if that were possible. As it is now Ill just have to lean on my memory.

Tastes great with a velvet feel in the mouth.  In a blind tasting I would really have no idea that this is a scotch ale because the bourbon and oak completely dominates the flavor profile.  But it doesnt matter because the beer is so well done and ridiculously smooth.

Taste has similarities to the original but it is much heavier on the mouth and the lack of carbonation only decreases the enjoyment for me.  Bottle lists ABV at 9.5% versus the 9.0% of the original which I find impossible to believe.   I am a little concerned that even after sitting in the bottle for 7 months before the release the carbonation has not come up.

654,"2011-01-13",4.0,"Bottle, thx for sharing tarheels. Pours dark brown with virtually no head (Probably because the bottle is 5+ years old). Aroma of bourbon, butterscotch, sweet malt, vanilla. Flavor is very bourbon heavy, maple syrup, vanilla. Lost a bit of body over the years but very drinkable and goes down easy with no booziness. I wouldnt say its necessarily better than regular Wee Heavy, just different, but in a good way. Great dessert beer.","Indiana, USA","tastybeer"
654,"2011-01-10",4.0,"UPDATED: JUL 18, 2011 750mL gold foil bottle #213/222 2005 bottling released 2007 thanks to GCurlow. Pours a relatively still, clear, deep ruby brune. Really no head but some yellow bubbles escape. Swirling the glass, you get no glass staining like a sugar bomb but you are rewarded with some decent looking legs. Aroma is superlative bourbon pretty much: straight butterscotch, caramel, ultra rich toffee, vanilla, bourbon soaked cherries, black cherries, cocoa butter, Frangelico hazelnut liquor. I mean you could just smell this beer for a few hours. The taste is wickedly smooth with signs that it was once hot as a mofo seeing this is now almost six years old. Spicy and sweet dichotomy: tiramisu, chocolate ganache, vanilla ice cream, hazelnut gelato. A soft, warming sensation creeps upon you with subtle timidity. The only beer to compare this to is really CCB BA Big Sound. This is darker, softer, so much more vanilla and robustness. There is a spicy, sweet component, a slight maple syrup component and ever so light tartness. As it warms (Ive been savoring it for an hour) there is smooth caramel, cafe latte, rich and palatable coffee, mocha, astringent and dry coffee beans. But the palate isnt quite there. The body is a little thin being robbed of carbonation. The taste not as robust and rip your head off as the normal Wee Heavy. What is the best Scotch Ale in the world has been robbed of mouthfeel and bite but gained aroma and dessert, port like vinous character. It is a treat worth savoring but I cant say I like it better than its little brother. 1/10/2011 9/4/8/4/15=4.0750mL 2009 ed thanks to peteinSD. The pour is not looking so hot- really needs coaxing to generate a thin, tan head. Otherwise you are going to just get bubbles. Not really a problem for this barrel aged beer. Nose is rich buttery bourbon, coconut, cinnamon raisin cake, cinnamon schnapps. Not as wildly exquisite as the 2007 bottle. Tate is a little too much black cherry soda for me, very sweet and malty as expected with some saving grace in the form of velvety chocolate cake, cinnamon chocolate ganache. Mild spicy alcohol. Beautiful for what it is, a sweet coconut raisin dessert beer. Needs to be savored. 7/17/2011 8/3/8/5/16=4.0","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

654,"2010-06-30",4.1,"Appearance: 2006 vintage, bottle 63 of 254, drank side by side with the 06 barrel-aged Old Numbskull. Dark ruddy brown in color, opaque except for some slight transparency around the edges. A thin tan head forms from a vigorous pour, settling quickly to a ring. This is slightly more carbonated than the barrel-aged Old Numbskull, but its by no means bubbly.

Smell: Rich and malty with a big oak barrel presence. Nutty, toasty, semi-sweet. Hints of vanilla and figs. This has a cleaner aroma than the barrel-aged Old Numbskull.

Taste & mouthfeel: Chewy toasted malt, tobacco and earth, chocolate and vanilla, huge oak flavor but not overtly bourbony. Malty, but drier than I was expecting. This is a mellow beer to begin with, but barrel aging has smoothed it out even more. No heat whatsoever despite the high ABV, and the low carbonation makes for a silky mouthfeel.

654,"2010-01-01",3.9,"In short: A fruity whisky with some port wine.  Very good but totally different (and inferior) to the regular version.
How: Bottle 750ml.  2005 release, bottle 210/222.  Consumed when about 3 year of age.  Sent to me by WeeHeavySD, thanks a lot Jon.
The look: Dark purple body (weird color) with almost no head
In long: Pleasant nose blending dark fruits with lots of bourbon.  Really smells like a fruity whisky.  Taste is single malt whisky, dark fruits juice, port wine and a lot of sweetness.   Body is syrupy and rather lifeless.  Just for fun (and because I like to do that type of things) I had a full bottle of the regular Wee Heavy and a bottle of this Barrel Aged version side-by-side.  This is actually a pretty damn good sweet sipper but it just doesnt compare to the regular AleSmith Wee Heavy which is one of my favourite Scotch Ale.  This is an original sipper, something I would gladly drink on occasion if I could by it at a normal price at a store.

654,"2009-12-03",3.6,"750ml bottle. 2006 # 182/254. Man... when I opened this one up, the aroma was all solvent, chemical and harsh alcohol. Brutal. Let it sit for about an hour and things have toned down... a bit. Lots of bourbon, vanilla extract, charred caramel. Plenty of wet wood. But still, there is a harsh chemical aspect to the aroma. Especially isovaleric acid upon warming. Stinky sock crossed with wood tannin. Bizarre and slightly off-putting. The cap popped off without a hiss at all. A vigorous pour yields a nearly still beer. Dark, dark cola brown with a thin ring of khaki around the edge of the glass. Thankfully, the beer doesnt taste as bad as it smells, though it lacks in complexity. The flavor is really dominated by the barrel aging. And not necessarily bourbon, per se, just lots and lots of wood presence. Dry oak, vanilla and coconut extract. Dry toffee, bitter bakers chocolate.  Really lacks the chewy, malty, smoky complexity of the regular, non BA offering. Not a whole lot to say. It doesnt taste bad at all, just lacks something. Medium bodied on the tongue. Firm texture. Fairly lively carbonation despite the near lifeless pour. Dry throughout the palate especially on the finish. 
Honestly, a big disappointment. I love the regular AS WH, and I was convinced that this one would rise to the top of my BA AS ratings, but the absolute chemical aspect of the nose and the lack of complexity on the palate really let me down. Its not a bad beer by any stretch... Maybe just not suited for aging. Perhaps the fresher BA bottles are the ones to drink. Oh well... Thanks Marc!","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"

The flavor is very similar, deeply malty and brimming with dark fruit, with a soft bourbon overtone that isnt overbearing.  The oak influence is quite apparent, and theres a hint of lightly tart bugginess that just seems to work well here.

A: Pours a murky amber hue with a small offwhite head. Very little retention and no real lace.

S: Wonderful barrelific aromas. Tons of fresh oak, vanilla, and wafty booze. Subtle smoky aromas hide beneath with brown sugar coated dark fruits.

T: Alesmith knows how to barrel age beers. As we all know the base beer for this one is world class to start with. The great part is the base beer is still there. Wonderful sweet malt, caramel, brown sugar, and toffee can all be picked out. The barrel does push it to another level though. The way the oak, vanilla, and booze seem to meld into the base beer is perfect.

Pours a deep, clear copper with a very fleeting, bubbly tan head that dissipated immediately and left no lacing.

The aroma is very good with more bourbon than I was expecting.  However, even with the big bourbon presence, there are plenty of signs of the underlying beer with caramel, toffee and lots of dark fruits.

The taste has a huge bourbon sting up front and in the finish.  In between there is the sweetness of caramel, toffee, raisins and some brown sugar.  The bourbon starts to meld much more smoothly with the flavor as this warms and adds plenty of oak and vanilla from the wood as well.

The mouthfeel is very slick with minimal carbonation.  The barrel presence is very evident, both with the boozy burn and the dryness of the finish.

This is a very boozy Scotch ale that will be tasty for those folks who really like a bourbon-heavy taste.  Another world class brew from Alesmith.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

Aroma is simply phenomenal. Notes of bourbon, vanilla, wood, peat, very light alcohol, slight smokiness, burnt toffee, some dark fruit and the slightest hint of some butter. The aroma is just so complex and all the aromas are blending together wonderfully. The body is smooth but rather thin and the carbonation is starting to fade just a bit despite the decent looking head and forces me to bump this one down a point. Flavors of peat, wood, vanilla, slight bourbon, and a sweetness of what I imagine artificial brown sugar would taste like. Overall an excellent beer to be sipping on as I toast in the birth of my first daughter, after all both of our last names are from our Scottish ancestory!!","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"
654,"2009-05-12",4.5,"Bottle 156 (I think) out of 200some. Bottle says 2006. This is one crazy beast. Absolutely, 100% no head, despite my efforts. Pours a dark red/brown. Has the clarity of pond water. On the surface the aroma is that of a nice woody single malt scotch, without brutal alcoholic assault on my senses. She is still a little rough around the edges, but nevertheless, Im enchanted. As it warms, other aromas come out more-maple candy, hint of butterscotch, and caramel/toffee sweetness akin to its non-barrel aged brethren. Palate is silky silky smooth, maybe a touch of slickness from some diacetyl. Carbonation level is just about right. The flavor goes through so many stages its hard to quantify or qualify. Starts out woody, melds into savory chocolate with a little bit of dark fruit (plum,currant, maybe anise), maple candy, and caramel/toffee sweetness. Finishes remarkably dry with a surprising amount of bitterness and maybe even some earthy hop business and very slight metallic twang. But soon, this finish dissolves as the malt reconquers my tongue coming with tons of savory chocolate and of course caramel/toffee sweetness. Finally the wood comes back in to smooth things out wonderfully. The hop bitterness and metallic twang do hang around for this, but only in a back seat role. Theres a bit of warming alcohol, but really the perfect amount. Let it also be noted that upon first sniff I thought the barrel aging was going to be over powering and the beer would not be so good. I was wrong.","Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA","ketchepillar"
654,"2009-05-12",4.3,"2006 bottle.  This is a really weird beer.  It looks a bit very muddy swamp water with no head and overall little carbonation.  It somehow makes me just want to drink it more though.  The aroma is a brown sugar, caramel, and then some bourbon.  Flavor is really sweet and quite complex.  It starts off with a bit of a wood character, evolves into a caramel/brown sugar sweetness and finishes with a lingering bit of alcohol, but nothing like the crazy BA beers that leave a burning in the back of your throat.  And even after that remnants of plum and fruit lingers.  Its a really weird beer, but it is a really nice and complex one.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","hillfiiiiire"
654,"2009-05-12",4.1,"2006. Murky brown pour with no head. Aroma of bourbon, wood and vanilla and chocolate covered raisins. The flavor is good, but what bumps it up to a 9 is its complexity. It takes almost a full 10 seconds for every aspect of the flavor to appear. First plum, brown sugar and grape, then bourbon, wood and vanilla, then finally a ridiculously sweet caramel/raisin finish. Smooth, relatively full mouthfeel with little carbonation. Mild alcohol presence. The way the flavor in this beer develops on your tongue is just awesome.

Aroma is deep and complex with lots of wood, bourbon and brown sugar on top of rum, molasses, booze, toffee, caramel, peat and overall slightly burnt earthiness. Mouthfeel is very lightly fizzy but actually a bit flat. This feels thinner than I believe the regular Wee Heavy was. Fairly sticky. Flavor is initially lots of big strong port and wood. Then there are notes of rum, molasses, bourbon, tar, peat, toffee and caramel. Some chocolate even develops in the finish as it gets deeper in the bottle. Lots of alcohol presence without feeling ""hot"".  I think the best flavor was at the bottom of the bottle (i.e., less alcohol? and perhaps thicker and maltier). A nice bitter bite  closes it out as it warms/ gets deeper in bottle. This is a big, interesting, complex beer but I think Id still go the Duck-Rabbit for my personal choice of a Wee Heavy.","Boothbay, Maine, USA","porterhouse"

654,"2009-02-18",4.0,"2006 vintage released in 08, bottle 253/254. The first thing I thought when I smelled the open bottle was bourbon. The beer pours a nice brown color and I am pretty sure it looks like the regular wee heavy but Ive only had that once. The aromas from the glass seem to be mostly vanilla and bourbon. The taste is pretty good, licorice, vanilla, nutty,fruits different than I remember the regular version but a hint of smoke and peat which I couldnt detect in the regular version. The alcohol is definitely present in this beer. This is a good beer but really only a twist to a beer that was already good to start with. I would definitely purchase this again if I ever had a chance. Damn you Alesmith!!!

654,"2008-09-15",3.9,"After saving this bottle for an unspecified occasion, I was moved to open it in tribute to Richard Wright, the remarkable keyboardist whose contributions to the music of Pink Floyd cannot be under-emphasized. And if you must ask, yes I did pour some of this precious liquid out. I only wish the beer itself lived up to the moment, let alone its momentous hype. 2005 bottle, numbered 40/222. Opened with just a whisper of a pop behind the crown, revealing its lack of carbonation. Nose was dominated by oaky vanilla whiskey. There is brown sugar and caramel in the background.  Color was a darkish cola brown, no head, no effervescence. Palate reveals only a light tingle of carbonation. Flavor was also dominated by the whiskey barrel contributions. Generally sweet, with a rounded mouthfeel, there’s a touch of bruised pear, acrid prune and raisin juice approaching the finish, which is strongly tannic with a near over-bearing alcoholic bite. Mouthfeel generally very full. I like the general theme behind it, and the intoxicating fun of it, but I’ve had a few barrel aged beers that exceed this one by some measure.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

The drunkenness hits fast, and in this case its not really worth it. I mean, really, this is pure bourbon. The normal Wee Heavy is no doubt one of my favorite beers, nearly perfect every time, but this has just been ruined by the barrels. Hell, I dont even taste oak in it, just a harsh, boozy mess.

I also get soft caramel candy and faint peaty earthiness. YUM!! The taste starts with an explosion of flavors that seem to hit all at once with wood, booze, wood, creamy caramel candy, and then more caramel, peat and even more caramel goodness. Wow. Everything seems pretty well balanced allowing for a nice woody, slightly sweet yet drying booze sensation as well as great notes of creamy caramel, peat and earthiness from the base beer.

I got it from a source I trust to have stored it properly. Im wondering if maybe this bottle happened to be capped by the same machine that capped their IPA in the last year or so and did not make a tight seal. I am sure there are posts here on RB about all that mess. Pours a dark caramelly brown, with barely enough bubbles to cover the top of the beer in the glass. Beautiful smells of bourbon and wood and vanilla. Alcohol as well. Tastes just as good as it smells. Bourbon and dark fruits up front, caramel and alcohol on the finish. As many other reviewers have said, the Wee Heavy base is pretty well covered by the flavors from the barrel.
Thick and full palate. I am very sad that the carbonation is gone. With even a minimal amount of carbonation this brew would have been perfect in this category. Even though its flat, this brew is the second best barrel aged beer that I have ever had. Behind only the BA Decadence.","San Diego, California, USA","doubleo"

654,"2008-01-09",3.5,"2005 Bottle 80 / 222, Sampled January 2008
This is the barrel aged beer of Alesmiths that I have wanted to try most.  As I pop the cap only a touch of gas escapes.  A vigorous pour cant do much but summon a thin, very large bubbled, bit of froth that doesnt completely cover the top of the beer.  The beer itself is a dark, brownish-amber color and shows an opaque, hazy, dark ruby / deep red color when held up to the light.  Aromas of Bourbon are quite apparent as I pour this brew; upon further inspection the Bourbon is still the most noticed part of the aroma.  Aromatic notes of vanillin, butterscotch, spicy oak and alcohol, almost a cola like barrel / malt note and a rich, deeply caramelized character that is contributed by both the bourbon barrel char and the malt are all evident in the nose.  Underneath these notes is a deep, if subtle, dark, caramelized fruit character that just sort of melts into the buttery oak and vanillin notes.  Despite being so Bourbon barrel dominated the aroma is actually quite smooth and seemingly well integrated; it does not come off as boozy in the least.

Very lightly carbonated, but not flat, the beer is fairly sweet up front.  This rich, sweetness makes me think of a vanilla infused dark fruit compote made up of raisins, prunes, figs, berries and a light cherry note.  Through the middle the beer starts to pick up a bit more of the Bourbon and barrel notes, which, by the time the beer has left my mouth, have become a dominating, spicy mix of warm Bourbon, piquantly spicy oak, a touch of salty peat, lightly phenolic smoke and alcohol.  This lingering flavor doesnt quite disappear until one takes another sip and lets the beer rest on the tongue to soak in the concentrated, rich, sweet malt and caramelized notes.  Rich caramel malts, flavors of melted brown sugar and dark toffee add to the complexity here.  Thick and chewy, the beer rests on the palate with a slightly sticky heft that is just barely offset by the minimal carbonation; the beer has about the same level of carbonation of a draught real ale, which actually sort of works with this beer as much of the chewy, rich malt notes are offset by the spicy oak / bourbon notes.  Sometimes with the minimal carbonation it can even seem a bit thin, but ultimately the texture of this beer is just quite nice.

I must admit that I like the regular version of this beer a bit better, but that is typically the case for me.  I just think that this one is holding up a bit better than most do as the base beer really is such a malty, monster of a beer (though you lose that with the bourbon barrel character layered on top of it).  My biggest complaint is the lack of substantial carbonation, a light-medium level of carbonation would be perfect, though it does still do well with the low level that it does have.  I really like how complex & integrated the barrel character is here, somehow, though it is the dominant note, it does not overwhelm my palate, and it is not too hot and one dimensional.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

654,"2007-11-15",4.1,"2005. Number 16 of 222. The pour from the bottle is a criminally dark mahogany with plum hues, very oily and visibly thinner and more viscous than the unaltered predecessor. Very low carbonation holds no hope of forming a head, but ultra-compact groups of tiny bubbles rest peacefully at the edge of the glass. Bourbon is evident as soon as the cap falls from the bottle, but the impact from the glass, sitting far across the table, is profound and more bountiful than expected. As the glass is drawn to the nose, a multitude of forceful and lighter but striking aromas glide forward from the top of the vessel to the depths of the nose and throat. Stronger and more forward nuances include plums, chocolate, caramel malts, sherried oxidative slivers, roasted grains, bourbon (including oak, vanilla, charred wood), raisins, molasses. Milder scents of smoke, peated malt, blackberry, varied dark red-skinned fruits and tar complete the parade. This is about what I expected. Thus far, it is very strong, relentless and lacks elegance. Nonetheless, its intriguing and challenging, not to mention it wreaks havoc on senses eagerly awaiting a good throttling. A descending alcoholic burn opens the nasal cavities and is a steadfast implication of the near-overwhelming flavor that follows. The first sip is roaring with bourbon, but closely followed by a webbed structure unlikely to be encountered in almost any other brewers works. Notes of sherry, from oxidation, are lessened as chocolate notes and stewing caramel lash out. Peat notes and smoke share an increased portion of the playbill, now arranged in a compact but straightforward display of spice and fervor. The flavor is immediately warming, a confrontation that arrives unexpectedly. Moderate roasted malt resides within this waming assault, unleashing tannic undertones and more vanilla and bourbon character than the nose. Sweetness is very high and bodes well for the very full body and low carbonation. There is low bitterness and barely any acidity present, furthering the dessert stylings of this ultra-dense concoction. The finish is hot and abrasive but satisfying too. An absolutely monstrous beer from an absolutely terrific brewery, but I cant think of another beer thats so good thats also so potent and warming. One to share.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

This poured a deep, cloudy, almost murky, dark brownish maroon, with a very small, bubbly light tan head.  The bubbles hugged the egdes of the glass and left small swirls on the cap.  Big caramel, bourbon, toffee, some dark fruit, and roasted malts all come together to form an enticing aroma that just sticks in the nose.  The bourbon certainly isnt overpowering and seems to be somewhat balanced well with the other aromas.  Cant wait to try a sip.  The flavor is lightly carbonated, almost certainly from the barrel aging, but still enough to give the mouthfeel some tingle.  The bourbon is quite pronounced in the flavor, moreso than in the nose.  Huge caramel characters, some vanilla, maybe a little oak, and light chocolate all seem to tag-team with the bourbon.  The finish is a little bit roasty and very full-bodied.  The aftertaste has a light little bitterness to it, with a big bourbon presence and a lot of caramel and vanilla flavors as well.

The flavor is a smack down of heavy malts, over-ripened fruits (mostly plums) and a peat overload at first. The midsection is mostly a mixture of sugar smack cereal and pumpernickel breads before the on rush of barrel comes crashing down on the finish, woody and boozy. A true palate overload and oh so enjoyable. The mouth feel is lush and sticky, aggressive alcohol bite cleanse the palate nicely. A wonderful work of art and much more enjoyable than the first try which I did not even bother to rate cause I thought my palate and nose was wasted.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
654,"2007-06-22",4.3,"Bottle 44/234.  I shared this with Sean and Craig sometime ago, and just now found the rating on my laptop.  Notes are from sometime in March...Pours out a dark brown color with a small tan head on it.  The aroma is very powerful and full of rich wood characters, some slight hints of bourbon, alot of peaty malt smells here too.  Taste is fruity, rich, full of sweet sugars and slight hints of bourbon.  These guys do not over do the bourbon barrel that so many brewers tend to just ruin beer with.  This is a perfect example of a barrel aged beer.  Overall this is the best scotch ale I have ever drank, and I do not imagine one being able to top this.  Great beer.  Thanks so much Sean.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"

3/10/2007:  AleSmith Barrel-Aged Wee Heavy is dark reddish-amber in color with a frothy, bubbly crown that leaves some lacing on the glass.  The aroma is very port-like with sweet vineous notes of cherry and oak.  The flavor is very malty (caramel) and fruity (i.e. dark fruits, dates, cherry) with some whiskey alcohol and barrel flavors (vanilla) as well.  The finish is slightly more dry than the rest of the flavor and the alcohol is quite warming.  This beer is full-bodied and is so smooth and mellow going down.  Very nice.  The AleSmith Barrel Aged Wee Heavy is SO much better than the regular AleSmith Wee Heavy (which I didnt care for much even though I love Scotch Ales and AleSmith).

654,"2007-03-30",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2007 Boy, this bottle has quite a story behind it. 

PART ONE: I had bought Droopy49 a Mephistopheles and a Dreadnaught. He was going to go beer hunting an find something for me. What does he get? This bottle...PERSONALLY SIGNED TO ME BY PETER! Juan, you are DA MAN!. 
PART TWO: I get a room at the Hilton for the Knoxville Tasting. I share the room with Shigadeyo and Ross because I am a nice guy. All three of us had worked out trades to be delivered in person. One bottle I was supposed to trade with Ross was the regular Ale Smith Wee Heavy. In a hurry, I accidentally grabbed the BA version going out the door. After the tasting, we were finalizing our trade at the room when I noticed that I brought the BA Wee Heavy. Like hell I was going to trade that to Ross for 6 Duck Rabbit Impys. Needless to say, Ross and Craig really wanted me to open the bottle and were giving me shit. It was late and I told them to STFU and go to bed. But Ross threatened to teabag me while I was sleeping, if I did not open it. So  I caved and opened the bottle. 
THE RATING: Bottle 44/234. Pours deep brown/ garnet with almost no head. Nice aroma of vanilla, cherries, raisen, caramel, and faint nuts. Initial flavor of caramel, dark fruits, and brown sugar. Middle has some very moderate notes of oak, joined by some faint chocolate. Smooth malty finish with the alcohol very well hidden. I was expecting lots more bourbon and oak, but the barrel aging really just blended into the beer. I would say it added more vanilla and sweetness as opposed to smoke,wood, or char flavors, which this one could have used more of. Perhaps this one mellowed a bit., because I did not pick up a ton of bourbon. Still, a very nice beer. I wish I had more detailed notes, but I was in no condition to rate based on my barely legible notes. Many thanks to Droopy49 for getting this rare treat for me.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"

Sampled on 8/2/06: Pours a transparent dark copper mahogany with a thin, wispy ring of off-white head.  Very nice, sweet complex bourbon oak and caramel malty aroma with a touch of peat.  Well-balanced and inviting.  Body starts with a good viscous dark caramel maltiness and a hint of milk chocolate before a very warming, lingering sweet complex maltiness.  Has a nice brown sugar character throughout and a touch of raisins.

Ive been saving this hordeing it since the 2006 release waiting patiently to drink it.  Bottl 43/234.  Consumed with my brother on 3/4/07.  Pours dark black brown with a whirly island of thin head with a ring of bubbles.  The smell is malty and sweet with a heck of a lot of Alchol in the nose, the bourbon is there fully.  The nose also has some notes of raisans and feels slightly like a BW.  Ive some how put off drinking this for a really long time, dont know why.  The taste is huge, sweet and malty, with a mollasses feel though it feels slightly thin in the mouth.  The palate is nice, but not as stellar as Id expected.

Slightly buttery, woody, smokey and eventually hinting at anise. Stays multidimensional through and through and luckily not all in sweetness. Shows mellow leafy tones toward the finish. Quite complex, already feeling a bit old with rounded aged iberic alcohols oxidation. It seems obvious as an afterthought that bourbon would work fairly well with a scotch ale, they both push a (albeit different) peaty and earthy character forth. Almost surprisingly, the alcohol character is unobstrusive at first, naturally pairing with the bourbon laden aroma and systematically warming, while letting the flavors lead in mouth. As it warms, its apparently growing stronger as well and I enjoy it a bit less. Medium body, soft carbonation, rather professional. Thank you marcus!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

654,"2006-06-23",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 5, 2013 Any first impressions?
-A ring of foam decorates the glowing ruby.
-Vanilla and bourbon alcohol fly out of the glass in perfect unison with the wealthy scotch ale personality.
-Plentiful berries and grapes diversify the vanilla bourbon, as the caramel sweetness deepens the lip-smacking experience.
-The mouthfeel is as classy and silky as most Alesmiths, yet the alcohol makes it feel sturdy.

What if you dig deeper?
-Some roastiness rides the alcohol warmth.
-Port wine and star anise allusions titillate the complexity-seeking tastebuds.
-The never-heavy body is lightened by the alcohol and the subtle supporting hop bitterness.
-Yet another potent, dignified, well-crafted barrel-aged strong ale from a fantastic brewery.

654,"2006-06-03",4.1,"(Bottle 75 cl) Pours a clear orangey brown with a very limited head. Aroma of raisins and bourbon - a very distinctive and pleasant aroma that is. Good, full body, slightly tart with massive alcohol. Notes of dried fruit - raisins in particular - raisins soaked in rum, or rather Bourbon as the oak and vanilla really shines through. Lots of roasted malt. Subdued bitterness. A lovely brew. 020606","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"
654,"2006-06-03",4.2,"Bottle #199. The color is deep red with a slight hazy hanging in the beer and with no head. The aroma is very sweet and very malty with strong notes of caramel, but also with signs of the alcohol. The flavor contains strong notes of wood and alcohol, combined with notes of caramel and vanilla, as well as light notes of whiskey. The alcohol tickles the tongue while drinking, and mouthfeel is thick.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

Malts are dark fruits and sweet, Lots of subtle oak and bourbon flavors.  Hints of caramel and sweet. There was some butterscotch but it disappeared after a little while. There is some peat and smoke as well Very full, creamy, and smooth mouthfeel. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet with a touch of bourbon.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
654,"2006-05-25",4.5,"A hazy brown beer with and aroma of brown sugar and bourbon. A sweet rich taste of sweet fruit and alcohol. A hugh palate and taste that almost overwhelms your taste buds. More than most beers its flavor continues to bloom as it warms. has excellent carbonation and mouth feel.  I think my favorite of Noogfest. Thanks John C.","decatur, Tennessee, USA","decaturstevo"
654,"2006-05-24",3.7,"Poured a hazy brown color with a thin off-white head.  I started out very sad when all I got at first was butterscotch.  I put my glass down for a little while to come back to it and happily it faded mostly away.  Next came woody notes with a good bit of vanilla and some bourbon.  Much better.  The flavor pretty much started with the bourbon and some vanillathen on to sweet malt.  It finished up semi-dry.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
654,"2006-05-22",3.5,"Sampled at Noogfest-II.  Thanks to John, I think.  Dark opaque chestnut color.  The aroma was very strange.  I swear that this smelled like cheese (mozzarella in brine).  Though I also noted oak and brown sugar.  Heavy aroma but the cheese thing was just too much for me.  Well mellowed alcohol (bourbon) with oak, brown sugar, light smoke, and lightly sweet dark fruit.  Overall a combination of flavors I might usually like, though not as much as I thought this time around.  Very creamy body, slick and lasting.  Overall, I was disappointed.  This was the one that I thought would be a real stand out for me and it was just OK.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"
654,"2006-05-22",4.5,"A brown appearance with virtualy no head. The aroma is filled with chocolate and whiskey. The flavor was somewhat sour and nutty with some chocoate, raisins, vanilla, and of course a lot of whiskey showing up. Pretty awesome, thanks JohnC.","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
654,"2006-05-22",4.5,"If I were male, I swear I would get an erection from the aroma.  I was afraid  I would be disappointed by this beer, and it wasnt even close.  Aroma is butterscotch, bourbon, with some fruity hints.  Flavor is much the same with an amazingly creamy, smooth mouthfeel.  some age on this puppy and it will by far be the best scotch ale ive ever had.","Marietta, Ohio, USA","LilKem"

654,"2006-05-11",3.9,"Thanks to Hopscotch for sharing this at
the Dark Lord party and to Sprinkle for trading it to him. Nose was loaded with butterscotch and vanilla. The BA-ing was not overdone it simply added to the delightfullness of this brew.

654,"2006-05-07",4.5,"Unless the bourbon from the BOURBON BARRELS equates to too hot than Im not sure about this beer being too hot .  Anyways  pour is darkish brown with minimal head.   Nose is big on bourbon....Let me rant a little..... this bourbon barrel thing yeah its new, but its basically a new style no?  So why not just get used to the idea that its a style unto its own and stop complaining hoping the style .   Pour is deep mahogony with lite off white head.    Nose is brilliant vanilla, bourbon, with a great maltiness coming through to really top thing off nicely.   Flavor really takes on the bourboness and hard core vanilla.   I do wish I had more of this to age and feel out over the years, but by no means do I feel its too hot to drink now.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","Dough77"
654,"2006-05-05",5.0,"Bottled 2004, number 28/234. This dark brown ale poured with a nice tan head that dissipated quickly, eliciting a very malty aroma. There is a distinct alcohol note to the already smoky flavor that leaves a bourbon taste on the tongue.  I light up a Trinidad Fundadore and view my spring garden in a California back yard, with magpies and jays seeking worms. I listen to Yusef Lateef screaming his life into ""Like It Is."" This is a definition of the essence of life!  Possible the best beer I have had.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
654,"2006-05-02",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2007 Bottle #17... DLD06.... This beer rocks!... Lightly hazy, caramel-colored ale with a small, fizzy, off-white head. The aroma is a wonderful blend of chocolate, coconut, oak, vanilla and sourmash. This bottles still a little hot. Lots of bourbon, caramel, dark fruit and chocolate in the flavor. Full-bodied and silky with lively carbonation. Finishes bourbony, malty and bone-dry. Given a choice, I would have layed this one down for a while, but I had to share it with my ""drinking buddies"" at the Hampton tasting. Another world class beer from Peter! Thanks goes out to sprinkle for the trade.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
654,"2006-05-01",3.6,"UPDATED: AUG 31, 2008 I got another chance to try this, and while it is much better than I remember my first sample of this was, I still think they screwed up a good by by putting it in that barrel.  I bumped the aroma up 2 pts and the overall up 2 pts.

Sampled at the Dark Lord/Hampton Inn tasting 06.  Many thank yous to hopscotch for sharing this much sought after treat.  Looks kinds of watery in the glass, but beautifly colored with browns and yellows.  This beer is still overwhelmed with bourbon.  Aroma, taste, palate, you name it, theres bourbon.  All of the typical bourbon barrel character is there: vanilla, oak, some smoke.  Some trace nuttyness and caramel can be detacted, but for a beer that was released with some age already on it, it is still way too hot.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"
654,"2006-04-30",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2014 Poured a hazy copper color with a small, light tan head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of strong bourbon, some vanilla, peat smoked malts, with caramel and a fair amount of alcohol.  Taste was also strong and really bourbony.  More nuts and roast, with vanilla, and light caramel.","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
654,"2006-04-30",4.4,"Bottle shared by hopscotch at Hampton Inn tasting post Dark Lord

After taking a short break so my nose and palate functioned again, I tackled this beast.  Hints of bourbon, vanilla, oak chips and malt combined to remind me of a wet fall day.  The body was a deep autumnal red, almost caramel color.  After admiring my small sample for a little bit, I took a sip to find similar items in the taste that presented themselves earlier.  There was vanilla, bourbon, cherries, dried oak chips and a creamy texture holding it all together.  The finish was a little bitter but still quite good as the union of tones slowly melted away in my mouth.  Thanks again for sharing hopscotch!","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
654,"2006-04-30",3.6,"Bottle:  Courtesy of Hopscotch at the Hampton Inn Tasting (Saturday).  Huge bourbon aroma with moderate vanilla.  Just the slightest hints of caramel sneak past all the bourbon.  Pours a transparent orangish-brown with a small off-white head.  Loaded with bourbon up front with vanilla, the slightest touch of caramel, and alcohol finish.  Outside the faint caramel that I can barely detect in the aroma and flavor, there is very little evidence of the base beer here.  While I find that I do like it solely because on the fact that I like the bourbon and vanilla flavors, theres just not enough base beer presence.  Another overdone bourbon barrel aged beer.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
654,"2006-04-11",4.4,"I had to rate it... bottle 217/234.  Pours a clear, dark brown color with a reddish small but sticky head and decent amount of stringy looking lacing.  Aroma is heavy with bourbon and smooth caramel, rich but very enjoyable on the nose.  Flavor is very similar with lots of bourbon and oak coming through.  Finishes with strong caramel and slight hints of alcohol.  Very smooth but heavy on the palate, kind of coats the mouth.  This is a very good beer that will be great as it ages.  You can always count on Alesmith for consistent top-notch beer!!","San Diego, California, USA","zug4abby"

Picked this up yesterday at Alesmith. Pours a hazy reddish brown with a minimal head. The aroma has some bourbon notes. The flavor is sweet. The maltiness of the scotch ale goes great w/ the bourbon influence. 

It goes down dangerously smoothly. Another great beer from Peter Z. and the crew at Alesmith.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
