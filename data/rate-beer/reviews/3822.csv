3822,"2014-10-01",4.3,"> Fresh, highly carbonated, no acid, Brett focused Orval clone 
[ Bottle ][ 500mL ][ MrChopin ][ Birthday Gift ][ Reidel Vinum XL Pinot Noir ][ 10.1.14 ]
>> Thank you Kevin! Extremely high carbonation, even with a tepid pour the head generated is absolutely insane. Murky, hazy deep orange glow. Nose is a crazy saison/lambic blend with something like Orval dregs mixed in with house yeast. There is quite a bit of blood orange and moldy red grapefruit. White pepper, tamarind, red bean. Taste is very light and refreshing, albeit a bit drained and a bit over carbonated. In the back is some light acid, but mostly this is a Brett saison with essentially no sourness. Still, no flaws and it is definitely a highly achieving funky barrel aged saison. With the lighter, drained, highly carbonated mouthfeel but obvious leafy hop character, I have to make a comparison here to Orval. It is scarily similar actually.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
