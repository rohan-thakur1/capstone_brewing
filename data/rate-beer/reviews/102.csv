102,"2016-01-20",4.3,"Corked bottle, Millesime 2010Light amber color. Deep aroma of caramel and concentrated apple juice, lively. Very sweet, yet not too syrupy; concentrated apple juice dominates the flavor, a bit of caramel, with a high degree of acidity, and ending like a good caramelized tarte tatin. Components are getting stronger, for a bold and long final.Less complex than the best ones, but still wonderful.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"

Nose is super complex, with caramelized apple, treacle toffee, almond essence, and low-medium sweetness for an ice cider. Flavour is super complex as well, with notes of almond, caramel, treacle toffee and brown sugar. Fair amount of alcohol heat that is well-situated, with medium sweetness. Elegant and complex. Phenomenal stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
102,"2015-12-02",4.3,"Bottle - Cooked apple and some peel with some interesting stone fruit. Clear gold. Such wonderful tropical notes and only the lightest amount of cooked apple. Brilliantly unique and different with little apple.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"

102,"2015-08-05",4.5,"Généreuse dégustation sur place. Quel endroit magnifique et tout un accueil de cette dame passionnée et, bien évidement, fière de ses produits. Version 2010 en premier lieu. Magnifique robe dorée ou presque orangée. Somptueuses traces de la viscosité du liquide sur mon verre. Richissimes parfums de compote fruitée avec des ananas, des pommes, des poires, des pêches et autres fruits qui méchappent. Beau coussin sucré, rembourré par le caramel, le miel et la vanille sur un alcool qui possède une personnalité boisée. Sur les papilles, cest la fête. Une confiture de fruits chargée par les sucres, timidement bordé par une belle acidité et révélatrice dun séjour en barrique. Au palais, je perçois un corps bien rond avec une texture presque sirupeuse et légèrement collante. En finale, les fruits sont explosifs, jouant les cartes du sucre et de lacidité dune main de maître. Fantastique création. (Vintage 2010 : 10/4/9/4/18). Vintage 2011 en deuxième service. Encore une fois, généreux verre servi sur place : il faut le souligner. Donc, au nez, arômes boisés avec un alcool plus visible. Au goût, saveurs plus sèches, plus vives en alcool, en acidité et en notes boisées. Très bon mais moins décadent que la version 2010.

102,"2015-07-09",4.2,"2 oz sample, 2010 vintage. Deep clear amber pour.

102,"2015-07-03",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 6, 2015 Sample at the cidery and 2 oz sample from bottle (375 ml) at home. 2010 harvest. 

Appearance: Deep orangey-golden wih impressive legs. 

Aroma: Nice fruity mix of pears, cooked apples and apricots along mild spiciness, light smokey presence, brown sugar and a touch of alcohol.

Taste: Very sweet with a nice acidic presence to balance the sweetness, both caramel and brown sugar, cooked apples, pears, iodine notes, oak, tobacco notes, light spiciness, a touch of alcohol and mild apricots presence... extremely complex! 

Palate: Full body. Thick and syrupy mouthfeel. A bit oily as well. Fruity finish with a pleasant warming presence and mouth coating sweetness (but again, well balanced by the acidity). 

Overall: World-class Ice Cider! Unique because of the mild and really well integrated smokey presence. Incredibly complex with a nice fruity touch (and not only apples, but pears and apricots) and superb balance. A masterpiece! 

Note: I also sampled the 11 harvest at the cidery side-by-side with the 10 and while it was still pretty good it was nowhere nearly as complex and unique as the 10.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
102,"2015-03-07",4.3,"Bottle thanks to GT, 2010 vintage. Pours a clear deep golden color. Youthful nose of fresh pear and apple, going to a sugared apple slice and apricot jam. The palate is elegant without being overweight, no yeast funk that I find to be present in many cidre de glace. Flavors of golden apples, apricot, acid, light oak, and hints of sweet spice. Outstanding.","CA to VA, California, USA","wutangfinancial"
102,"2015-03-04",4.3,"Shared with GT2 on my birthday weekend in SB. Purchased originally at Cidrerie Minot- this was a crazy ice cider that we sampled so we got a 2010 vintage to go. Clear light orange in the matching stemware. Apple danish/strudel dessert aroma. Thick, sweet apple pie in the beginning with crisp, firm tartness to balance. Complex blend of sweet and sour play. Sipper...easy drinking dessert cider.","Oceanside, California, USA","biggirlpanties"

>> Minot des Glaces, Vintage 2010. When we sampled this ice cider at the cidrerie, the sample was Maderized and savory. Really odd, but we liked it. It was from an already opened bottle. This fresh bottle was nothing like that, for the better probably. Pours a deep crystal clear orange pour. Big legs. Nose is salty baked apple pie, mild red apple, crisp and fresh. Taste is outstanding- sweet, salty, sour, mild tannic oak balance. Neutral all around and refreshing, never sticky. Ridiculous that it is 5 years old. The front palate is more on the sweet side, but the balance between tannin, acid, and salt makes this an incredible dessert cider.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Some apple, vanilla, and a touch of stone fruit preserves. Intense. There is a great sweetness of jammy cooked strawberry and apple. Cotton candy, vanilla, and caramel apple. Light, but sufficient, acidity. Solid. One of the standouts.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with notes of bright dank fruits, sweet pie, baked apple crisp. Sweet sugar on the palate throughout.

102,"2014-12-14",4.7,"Ce cidre de glace me semble plus foncé que que certains, mais cest tout aussi lumineux. De bonnes grosses pommes bien mûres et bien froides avec des parfums floraux assez charmants. Les saveurs sont apportées par une texture suave et langoureuse qui imprègne la bouche de particularités aussi intenses que diverses. On y retrouve la pomme dans toute sa splendeur et de plusieurs variétés.. Un léger picotement bien agréable, des pointes poivrées, des moments surets et acidulés qui sallongent en arrière-goût nous rappellent que nous avons la confirmation quon déguste un produit des plus fins et réussis.
