2189,"2016-11-04",3.5,"They only called this a festbier to be cute but its still good, Im just mad about it. Its copper colored w/ a foamy head. Aroma is big lemony hops up front but there is just a touch of Grape Nuts malt character underneath it. I like the combo in the nose but it seems to clash a little when you taste it. This is full bodied and a touch sweet but there is a good solid whack of bitterness to balance to everything works out pretty well. This isnt a perfect beer but I cant say I mind drinking it much.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

2189,"2016-10-14",3.4,"16 oz. can, sent for review. A nice light amber pour under a sudsy head. Theres a spicy rye smell to the nose, and the hop seems more of an English earthy note with a bit of Noble hop, perhaps because the rye and the color give it a hint of a Newcastle. Taste carries on the rye spiciness, but also seems to carry some smoothness as if theres oatmeal in the mix, too. Thought htis is only a minor variation on a solid, malty Oktoberfest.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

2189,"2016-09-05",4.5,"Surly makes it quite clear that this Oktoberfest is their own interpretation of the style instead of a classic fest bier, and thats a beautiful thing. The dark orange color is a bit lighter than the copper shade of most fest lagers. Aroma is perfect; maybe not strictly for an Oktoberfest, but for me. Spicy rye, floral and piney hops. Interestingly, flavor does seem more traditional. Grassy rye, biscuit malt, and mildly herbaceous, tea-like hops. Medium-bodied and crisp. Delicious.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

There is bread, caramel, nuts, and some spicy undertones. Some rye comes through more at the end, with a light, though fairly long lasting aftertaste.

2189,"2014-09-07",3.7,"Got this in a recent BIF package. 16oz can poured into a standard pint.


A - Pours deep amber with a strong one finger off white head, dissipating to a light film, leaving a web of lacing down the glass.


S - Crisp citric hop aroma with plenty of breadiness from the chewy malt. Some spiciness from the rye is an unexpected twist but goes very well with the other aromas. Good balance of spice, hops, and yeast.


T - This one is quite hoppy for being a bavarian type lager. Hops are citrusy and powerful but never really take over the beer. Plenty of breadiness from the cereal malt and some lingering spice from the rye help round this one into one crazy lager. Quite complex yet tasty to say the least.


M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. An almost creamy feel with a strong bready finish. The huge amounts of chewy malt become overpowering over the period of the can.


D - Decently high. I liked this one but the over the top chewiness got to me over the course of time. It was still very nice. I cant wait to try some of the other surly beers.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

Taste comes on smooth and builds through finish and aftertaste. Contrary to the above, this is the best Surly I have ever had. However, I am disappointed by the hoppiness of what is supposed to be more malt, less hop. Aroma and color are better than the taste.

The smell on this beer wont blow you away.  Like in the Bitter Brewer up above I was first hit with a toasty or roasty malt aroma mixed in with small amount of citrus.  But as this beer sits for a bit the Rye really picks up and drowns everything out. 

Taste is really nice and if I had to drink another lager today I might just pick this one up.  The rye is spicy and gives a nice bit of rawness to the brew.  The citrus and other fruit once in a while peaks its way through the rye.  The beer finishes off with a slight hop bitterness that sits on the tongue.

3.0 A: Pours a slightly hazy orange amber color. Dont know if this beer is a bit past its prime, but the one finger of soda like white head falls at breakneck speed and leaves small dots of lacing randomly.

4.0 S: Interesting. The only thing that is oktoberfest-ish about this beer is the yeast. No graininess to be found. Rather, its full of herbal hops with earthy rye. Sweet caramel malts mixed in for good measure.

3.5 T: Again, not much festiness in here. The yeast is appropriate, but thats it. I would call this a Rye AP Lager. Herbal and spicy hops. Rye comes through well again with some crystal malts. Not to style, but certainly not bad.

2189,"2010-12-22",3.8,"From notes:

Pours a slightly hazy golden orange/amber color with a 1.5 finger frothy, pillowy yellowish head that has great retention, only slowly fading to a lasting cap. Sporadic sloches of soapy lacing left behind.

Citrus hop aroma with hints of pine and citrus fuit balanced out by some sweet caramel malt.

Very hoppy for the style with a bitter piney hop blast up front which is balanced by a nice caramel malt backbone. Im also picking up slight hints of rye. The hops give off hints f pineapple, grapefruit and lemon peel. There is a slight lactic creaminess that alng with the malt prfile make this beer extremely smoky and quaffable.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

A: pours an orangish copper with an off white head.

2189,"2010-11-22",2.5,"A: The pour is a fairly opaque dark amber/light brown color with fairly minimal head formation.

S: Theres a really weird aroma to this beer...some nutshells along with peanut butter. A mild breadiness as well as some misplaced acidity. The one redeeming factor is the touch of earthy hops that comes in toward the back end.

T: Lightly bready with a fruit character (white grapes?) that doesnt really seem to belong. Again, mildly acidic with some faint nuttiness. Really all over the place.

M: The body is medium with the carbonation fitting the same description.

And they didnt. This one poured a hazy amber with a small white head. Light lemon, light malt, and some almost tropical fruity hop notes dominate the nose. Well-balanced and delicate. Taste is smooth and lightly hopped. Theres sweet malt without being overbearing or cloying. I think smooth is the word of the day for this beer. It went down terribly quick even though I was trying to savor it and the way the flavors integrate mean there are no rough edges that need smoothing. I would really like a 4-pack of this when it comes out.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

S- Caramel malt, citrusy hops, and a touch of rye.

T- Upfront is a pretty big citrus hop flavor with a rich O-fest nutty, caramely malt backbone. The finish is a bit bitter with the rye and hops coming through a bit more but the bitterness fades quickly and leaves behind highlights of the wonderful initial flavor.

P-Wonderful, smooth, light, slightly oily body with medium to high carbonation.

O- This is a great collaboration of rye, hoppy, and o-fest. Great flavors and lager quaffability. Reminds me a little bit of great lakes Elliot Ness. Well done overall and something I would like to trade for next time it comes around.

Pours a near transparent orangey fiery amber, well carbonated, with a decent bright white head that dies to a decent film, light lacing. Aromas are a well hopped malty brew, english malts, biscuity and caramel, bready, with light spice, and a pretty good floral hopping. Not bad, different. Malt profile takes on a good Oktoberfest feel, bready, biscuity, caramel, spicey with a good green hop feel, fairly floral and grassy, this works well. Spice takes a backseat to hops, but the malty bready appeal is there, spice is sufficient and not over the top. Lighter on the palate, with good bittering hop and a touch of mellow smokey rye towards the back end. Quite tasty, a bit underbodied but very sessionable. This is a very good beer, a beer I could drink often.

Sure, theres a bundle of caramel, toffee and toasty notes, but also a decent bit of lactic acidity and a heaping helping of piney, grapefruity hops.

Pours an orange color without much of a head.  Smell is malty and fruity, with a huge dose of fresh smelling hops.  The smell I think is what makes this beer seem better than it may be.

Theres a kiss of rye-flavored honey, some deeper Munich malts, a fairly quiet yeast flourish, and some tart, sweet hop sugars. This is good, but its a little bland, even for an Octoberfest for me.

Pours a dark, clear amber with tons of bubbles rising to the top feeding a cream-colored head that lingers for a long time leaving generous lacing.

The aroma is much hoppier than I expected with both citrus hops and some more earthy grassy hops as well.  There is a bready malt aroma and a hint of rye, but just a hint.

The taste leans more on the earthy hops with a bitter kick up front before giving way to the bready malts.  The rye actually comes out more as it warms and is most evident in the finish.

The mouthfeel is super creamy but with lots of carbonation.  Fairly heavy for the style, but very much to my liking!

2189,"2007-12-28",3.7,"Despite being around for a couple years, I still cant quite help getting a kick out of it every time I pop the tab of a canned craft-brew.  The beer pours with a lightly hazy, reddish amber color and is topped by a frothy, initially two-finger thick, light tan colored, textured head that is creamy enough to leave a layered lacing pattern on the sides of my glass as I slowly consume the beer.  Spicy notes of grain and hop mix wonderfully in the aroma; slightly grassy, definite earthy rye spice aromatics as well as an herbal, candied lemon zest & currant hop character.  Toasty malt notes and a touch of caramelized grain sugars enter in towards the finished spurring the imagination towards thoughts of brown sugar crusted, marmalade coated, toasted, organic, artisinal bread that has been crushed into an aromatic powder.  Quite an interesting aroma; very enticing, entirely engaging and hearty enough to be a harvest time tipple.

Well carbonated, which combines with a sharp hop character that is both herb focused and lemon zest like.  Grassy hop notes combine with a soft, yet gripping, bitterness in the finish.  The rye does not add a whole lot to the flavor, but does seem to contribute a grassy slightly spicy note that lingers long after a sip has past down my throat.  The rye does seem to contribute to the body of the brew as this has a definite viscous heft to it without being cloying.  Grassy flavors, touches of currants and a certain menthol like note all seem to be part of the hop profile.

The grassy hop character seems to grow a bit as the beer warms up a bit, coupled with a sort of pine / menthol note (but not in the typical American hop way), this becomes the dominant, though not quite defining, characteristic of this brew.  If you hadnt guessed this really is quite hoppy, definitely a hop dominated brew; sort of like a cross between an IPA and a malty Oktoberfest.  Quite tasty, a really enjoyable brew and I am glad they did not brew another typical Oktoberfest (while I do enjoy a well crafted traditional one, truly great ones are few and far between).  Perhaps my only complaint is that the hops get in the way of really noticing the rye character.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Taste is nice, and mildish aside from a decent dose of grassy hopping and a nice bitterness level.  Easy on the malt, and not a sweet or tart oktoberfest like Im used to but more mildly sharp and zesty, perhaps from the Crystal Rye.

2189,"2007-12-08",3.5,"16 oz. can. Strong, clean, yeasty smell. Herbs and spices (oregano, tyme, chives, cilantro) dominate the unique aroma. Smells like a lager version of a Christmas ale. Pours a mostly clear copper color with just a touch of haze. Large amount of fluffy, uneven, yellow-tinted, cream/light tan head. Produces thick lacing. Very nice, clean appearance. Hops dominate the flavor to a remarkably high degree. All of the spices present in the aroma also appear in the flavor. Bitter. A touch of citrus, especially grapefruit. A bit of underlying floral sweetness, but, for the most part, the malts are subdued. Dried leaf flavor that makes the beer taste like autumn. That presumably derives from the dry-hopping process. Dry finish. Long, herbal, bitter aftertaste. Light body. Oaty softness in the palate, but that probably results from the water used rather than actual oats. Interesting palate effects, but it is so soft and light that it feels insubstantial in the mouth. SurlyFest is not as malt-forward and far hoppier than a traditional Oktoberfestbier. Thats okay with me, as Im not a big marzen fan. This is probably my least favorite Surly product, but it fits well within their modus operandi of brewing unique, style-bending beers.

2189,"2007-10-24",4.3,"drank a ton of this stuff on tap last year and never got around to reviewing. Now that its canned, I may consume it within the comforts of home and the computer.
Brilliant orange color, very shiny with a halo of yellow nearer the bottom and edges. Firmly stacked foam of spongy looking consistancy lathers up to a decent height of nearly two inches. Dwindles down slowly to let loose a pattern of thin inky strings across the glass as its consumed.

Aroma is much like other O-fests with a nice firm realm of maltyness creating a sweet soft doughyness and a puff of dark grassyness and whole grains can be easily detected within. Very well-balanced aroma and well placed on the nose with good strength.

Taste is a broadly detailed malt brigade of heavy toasted malty sweetness, doughy, crisp with a spectacular grassy grab at the midway point which then goes all hoppy and drys off the palate with a subtle ease and tone that is incredibly delightful and inviting with grass, toast, and whole grain nuttyness. Quite complexingly subtle and straight up damn yummy.

Feel is about medium with a certain crispness to its malty body. For surely clean and easy. Has a creamy stained under carraige but stays mostly toasted and drys into the finish with a lushfully charming and soothing softness and cleanness with a willingness to venture more.

Drinkable and then some. Enough said. Damn solid O-fest by Surly! Grab your lederhosen, a big Ol mug, pour a bunch of this in, and sing yourself a song until you fall asleep and do it again.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Overall this seems like a blend of a well-hopped APA and a rye-Oktoberfest. Definitely a unique brew and one that is worth trying if you get the chance. Thanks for sharing this one with us, Tim","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

2189,"2007-10-14",3.5,"16oz. can.  Nicely aromatic, full and well-hopped with notes of flowers, dried leaves, fresh wood, earth, pine, orange and candyish brown sugar, some light biscuity maltiness here as well.  Translucent light-medium orange amber color with a lasting, ivory head.  Flavor is nicely balanced between the nutty, toasty, light caramel malt sweetness and rather substantial hop bitterness, and features suggestions of citrus, pine, and a pleasant spiciness courtesy of the rye.  Finishes fairly dry and crisp, some lingering hop resins here.  Nicely active, clean mouthfeel with a light-medium body.  Certainly not what one typically sees from this style, but is nicely flavorful and pretty interesting stuff.  Cheers to theisti!","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
2189,"2007-10-14",3.4,"Copper color nice tan well laced head.  Very hoppy aroma, not recognized but some sweet grains.  Avg pal.  Grainy well hopped grass finish some caramel.  not like any okt Ive ever had but not bad.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
2189,"2007-10-14",3.5,"16oz can from theisti. Aroma is melanoidins, caramel, and floral, mildly spicy hops. Copper colored with a two fingered head and active carbonation. Initial taste is earthy, spicy rye followed by a huge rush of bitterness, bread crust, more earthiness, and some caramel. It certainly is an interesting beer, I got two and I drank one yesterday at a football game (out of the can) and this one today the proper way. The malt bill is unique, to be sure, the rye gives it a lot of the earthiness and spiciness you might from the traditional hops used in a Märzen, but the American hops give it a distinct flavor. It is a nice drinking beer, but I would like it to be a touch maltier. All in all a tasty beer, but I hope that next years version retains the general idea (rye, american hops and lots of them) but approaches it in a general direction.   Brewers notes for the 2007 version  Brewed with Vienna,Pilsen and Rye malts.German Lager yeast.Kettle and dry hopped with Sterling.

Pours amber/brown with a foamy dense cream colored head.  Left behind some nice lace.
Killer aroma.  Not really an oktoberfest aroma, but really interesting.  Theres the rye, that I feel is the upfront character.  Then there a pronounce grassy dry hop character.
Okay, Im on the fence with the flavor.  The rye and all the hops are confusing.  I know.  Thats the point.  Rye chracater abounds.  Sort of an aggressive noble hops flavor and brash bitterness.  Things seem to blend and present themselves better at warmer temps.
The palate is right on.  Medium body on the full side of medium.  Lively but not aggressive carbonation.  Dry finish.
The RB description states that this beer was made with Summit.  I have read in places that that wast the 06 version.  The 07 version was made with Sterling hops.  I would suspect that these hops would lend completly differenct character to the beer.  Anyway, what we have here is another original and interesting beer from our friends at Surly.","Greenfield, Indiana, USA","tjthresh"

2189,"2007-10-04",2.4,"16 fl. oz. can, pours a coppery orange with bubbly yellow-white head.  Sour, citrus and hop aromas.  Mostly hoppy taste with some slight caramel/citrus flavors.  Hop flavors tend to dominate the light body and palate.  A little too sour and bitter for my tastes.  Dry finish with an aftertaste that has a medicine (aspirin/astringent) tone.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","zeke626"
2189,"2007-10-01",3.4,"Clear medium amber-red with a medium-dense light tan head.  The aroma is somewhat off--there is some hops character there but it is surmounted by a combination of grain and lager fermentation aromas that initially form something off-putting.  Beyond that, the flavor is crisp with nice grain notes--rye--hops bitterness, a hint of fruitiness, and some lager yeast notes.  The body is light but has good presence and finishes pleasantly bitter and dry.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"
2189,"2007-09-25",3.5,"Very interesting rendition here.  Not unlike Surly to push the style designations, this tastes like no other Octoberfest Ive ever had.  Perfume, grass, citrus, and mango aromas.  Some grape? in the flavor.  Hoppy profile along with a tinge of rye.  Ill say it again, very interesting.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
2189,"2007-09-24",3.8,"Deep, clear foxy colour, with fluffy, off-white head. Absolutely beautiful C-hops, but mildly dosed, very aromatic, dry hopbales and ending in a meaty, even fishy ester. Bitterish and none-too-sweet caramel. Rather well balanced. Nettlecheese and hops (hopscheese?). I wonder where/if the rye contributes. Slight slickness, dry finish.

Aroma of piney Summit hops (almost more/like Cascade), with caramel malt, some sweet honeydew, and a touch of yeast. Taste is lightly carbonated, medium bodied, with a decent bitter caramel flavor. Finish is more bitter than the normal sweet after taste that oktoberfest brews have. But then again, this is Surly! Yah, dis goot-en hoppy!","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

Not my favorite Surly, but nice nonetheless.","Farewell Minny; Hello Puyallup, Washington, USA","joebrew"

Pours a nice, rich amber with a thin white head. Toasty malt, with a hint of rye, some yeasty dryness and loads of hops on the palate. Medium to full bodied with a burst of grassy hops on the finish. By far, the most unique Oktfest Ive ever tasted. Definitely brewed outside the style bounds. Another winner from Surly.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
2189,"2007-09-12",4.4,"Enjoyed at Stubs.For those who dont like hops, dont drink this beer, it is Surly for god sakes, so what do you expect? Easily the best octoberfest beer i have ever had. Ultra hoppy with a nice rye flavor in there for sure. This is certainlly like no other o fest around, and if your a style geek you probably wont like it as its brewed quite a bit outside the ol lines, just the way i like it.

2189,"2007-09-11",3.0,"(on-tap at the Surlyfest Premier at Stub and Herbs) Poured amber with an off-white head.  Aroma was pretty mellow, but mainly consisted of hops, much like the taste.

Hazy, samll-bubbled amber body with a small lasting white foamy head and a bit of lace....smelly, pungent hoppy nose, a bit farmy and leafy with just a trace of smoky/toasty malt lurking....smooth, light apple-cherry notes amidst toasty malt in the moderately sweet, full and slightly sticky body....how they can call this an Oktoberfest I dont know, certainly if rating this to style or as a judge it wouldnt fare well, but judged for just what it is, well its a pretty nice IPA/German lager mix.

2189,"2006-10-01",2.5,"Orange colour, more to the red side of things. There was a nice big head on it, and it lasted for quite a while. The aroma was pretty typical of a marzen, but lacked the familiar malty and somewhat spicey profile. The first sip was quite surprising, filled with hops. Mostly bitter, with some grapefruit qualities. I didnt get much else out of the flavour on this, despite the feeling there was more hiding in there.","Mayer, Minnesota, USA","hellomynameis"
2189,"2006-09-25",4.2,"Bryant Lake Bowl on tap. Out-frikkin-standing. The hops in this were alive and intensly aromatic. The malt body was true to style but thicker than your traditional marzen. Im not a style stickler and have appreciated when brewers like FFF and Surly brew outside of the normal boundaries. I would much rather have this in my stein than anything they would serve in Munich. This is more balanced than the Furious and my favorite so far from these guys.","Mt Kisco, New York, USA","Brewso"
2189,"2006-09-12",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 18, 2006 TennisJoel and I were out for some tennis and beer tonight, and the last stop is Pigfoots place, the Blue Nile.  Al always has some good things on tap.  Little did these two conservatives know that tonight was some sort of party for a Democrat Congressional candidate.  I was afraid the television camera would find me there.  Anyway.  This is a good beer but the least impressive I have tasted form Surly, and I only say that because they have set a high bar for themselves.  This beer has a powerful hop aroma, rather than the light Octobery aroma I expect from a marzen.   The beer is red, and has a large, lacing white head that does last a long time. Flavor is almost all hops, with very light malt, the opposite of what I expect from an Octoberfest.  I like Surly and have yet to have a bad beer from them.  But this beer is predictable however, and it is time for these guys to branch out into something that does not leave a hop burn.  Good work, but go for more guys.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
2189,"2006-09-11",4.1,"Reviewed from a sample bottle provided by the brewers prior to release. SurlyFest is their take on an Oktoberfest, but, like most of their offerings, isnt likely to satisfy style sticklers. Single-hopped, with Summit, and dry-hopped, using German malt and Crystal Rye. 40 IBUs, between 5 and 6% abv. One single batch brewed, lagered for about 3 months.

Dark orange color, fairly hazed, with a fine slice of bubbly white froth above.

Malty aroma, light fruit, some pumpkin, vegetal, grassy, ...an intriquing blend. Smells like an O-fest, for sure, but doesnt hit me with hops like I anticipated. But definitely hoppier than than the normal Marzen.

Taste: crisp, smooth, slightly sweet, well-balanced, streams through the senses with ease, without being the least bit light bodied or thin. Just delicious. Eternally tasty. Brilliant flavor. Just shines. My vocabulary and sense perception fails me. This is quite a new thing on the tongue and a real, true delight for the tastebuds. Hops really hang in there in the finish, staying on the palate for a spell like a good pale ale or IPA would. A refreshing switch-up for a malty lager!

In other words, I like it! Cant wait to try it fresh off the tap.
Another excellent entry in the growing line of Surliness. Well done, guys!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
