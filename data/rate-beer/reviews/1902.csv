1902,"2017-02-18",3.6,"Poured into an English pint glass, the appearance was a ruddy burnt orange to amber color with a fingers worth of white foamy head that dissipated at a nice pace. Sly sticky lace.
The aroma had some semi-sweet bready to biscuity malts with a mild soapiness. Grassy and earthy hop bitterness. 
The flavor stays true to the aroma, semi-sweet with a subtle bitterness. Mild flowing hops to malts aftertaste with the same sort of finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a good sessionable sort of feel. Carbonation felt fine. ABV felt appropriate.
Overall, this was definitely an English pale ale throughout and I could see myself coming back to if I could get it again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

 Served on tap in an imperial pint glass

 Appearance  The beer is served an orange amber colored brew with tons of tiny carbonation bubbles seen streaming up through the body of the beer. Floating atop the beer was a one finger pure white and foamy head that faded rather fast. Once largely faded, there was a persistent film and a good deal of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is sweet of a citrus smell with lots of tangerine and orange and a nice sweet tropical fruit and apricot smell as well. Mixed with these aromas is a little bit of a malty smell as well as some piney and floral aromas.

 Taste  The taste begins with a biscuit and cracker taste mixed with a moderate dose of caramel sweetness. As the taste moves forward the sweeter taste profile changes becoming less caramel like, but more sweet fruit like with flavors of tangerine and pineapple dominating. Mixed with the bready flavors that are initially present is a light citrus hop taste of a grapefruit nature which creates a base for the brew. While the hop is light at first overall, toward the end it gets quite a bit more intense as the grapefruit is joined by other hop flavors of a floral and earthy nature. The transitions of the sweet flavors and the presence of the more potent earthy hop flavor that develops on the tongue at the finish, ends up leaving a moderately earthy bitter and smoother malty flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is average in terms of its thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is, as would have been expected from the appearance, composed of tiny carbonation bubbles. Overall the medium bodied nature mixed with the moderate but peppery carbonation were nice for maintaining a more refreshing and easy drinking brew all the while still allowing all the nice hoppy flavors time to be fully appreciated by the tongue. 

 Overall  A rather tasty and smooth tasting brew with a very nice but still quite drinkable level of hop. Overall it is a rather balanced brew and a treat to drink.","","Darkmagus82"

1902,"2012-03-20",3.2,"18-Mar-12 (22-oz bottle)This is a very tasty, easy to drink beer.

The nose is malty, toasty, slightly caramely, and grassy, with toffee, yeasty fruitiness, and a touch of earth.  The malty character is most prominent in the flavor, where its lightly sweet, caramely, and fairly toasty with a modest flavor of toffee.  Gently bitter hops add a flavors of tea, grass, and hay, and its slightly fruity in flavor as well.  Medium in weight and the medium carbonation is very smooth and creamy.

1902,"2011-11-29",2.8,"This beer really riled me up. As a beer itself, I found this to be cloying, even sickly sweet, with a thick body approaching a DIPA that itself could have been pleasing but not given the level of sweetness. The volume of the ingredients (malts and hops) is admirable, and the hops were perfume-like from the moment I popped the top, but it didnt integrate with the malts. And then I read the label, which expands on how this is an English-style beer. Uh-huh. I really dont see it. It hearkens a bit to the golden summer ale, but not to the English strong ales, which usually dont provide the kind of sweetness or bracing hoppiness. It just doesnt work, and it doesnt fit my sense of what this beer should be given that it has this label. So thats a double fault. Bottle.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

1902,"2010-11-15",3.1,"Copper orange with a fluffy head of pith, lace sticks to the sides of my glass before receding into a thick blanket of bubbly foam. Betcha didnt think Id get that all in one sentence, huh? Hah! Now, back to the beer. Her nose is right out of the forests of Boulder if I do say so myself. Pine needles and air heavy with wet pine and forestry esters meet and greet with generous aplomb. Underneath is the dry woodiness of bark followed by the sticky sappy bounty found within. Orange and mango skin provides some nice tropical bitterness to remind us that hops arent all about the evergreen, nosiree. Make no doubt though; pine is still the main star of my snuffing and now quaffing show. Crisp with a touch of orange sweetness which greets first and then steps aside for pine, fir, and trees ohmy. Pine bark mingles with the orange skin while sticky sap and piney resins gleefully coat my lips and gently braise the top of my tongue while orange and mango is a gentle river of sweetness underneath. Quaff and repeat, and I dont mind if I do.


Boulder may have skiing going for it, but personally, Id be going for the beer. Sure, you might find me playing out in the snow, brew in hand, but dont expect these feet to ever see any kind of skis, boards, or whatnot.

1902,"2010-10-05",3.3,"12 oz. bottle, dated 09/01/2010 and consumed a month later on 10/05/2010.  Pouring a very slightly hazy, dusky, rust-orange amber color, the body supports a small, frothy, cream tinted head.  Settling to a patchy film, the crown leaves dense, tattered bands of hard lacing all around the glass.  The nose is hopped at American IPA levels, sporting juicy grapefruit peel, orange pith, and lemon zest, along with some dank grass and some very earthy, dusty floral notes.  Underlying malts are biscuit driven in the English pale style, also suggesting day old bread.  The more it warms, the more dry, dank, and grassy it gets, even showing some cannabis notes.  Flavors are similar, showing some sweet caramel and biscuit up front, but quickly turning aggressively bitter, biting with very peppery, earthy flower and grass notes, with lemon peel coming through to a lesser extent.  Dank hops linger for a long while after the finish.  The palate is substantial in body, sticky with malty sugars and under carbinated, drinking kind of heavy for what it is. Alcohol is too prominent.  I like alot of what this beer has to offer, but it has its fair share of flaws as well.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

1902,"2009-11-07",3.4,"Enjoyed from a 12oz bottle in a pub glass.  The beer pours a light amber color, the classic hue of an English pale ale.  The nose brings a refreshing character of west coast citrusy hops, with an especially prevalent note of Casecade.  The palate starts bitter up front, lending a note of grapefruit and a slight touch of resin.  However, the beer appears to have been left to dry hop for too long, as there is a grassy character that begins near the mid-palate, and that detracts considerably from the rest of the flavors that are otherwise quite good.  Notes of crystal malt come through subtley in the mid-palate to finish, as does an earthy set of esters from the English yeast strain.  Overall, nicely subtle and promising, both in terms of its English and American characteristics, however, in need of some refinement.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

OK I do not prefer english style hopped ales but I figured since it was being recommended I would give it a shot

Looks - its a hazy, cloudy yyellowish orange. Almost looks like a lass of piss after a heavy drinking night.

Aroma - I get some grapefruit, but primarily orange and tangerine nose on this. Its also really mild nose.

Mouthfeel - medium bodied, light citrus upfront then the little bit of bitter that it has comes through on the back end.

Drinkability - This beer is a descent beer which I think it may fall under a more hoppy beer than a regular english style ipa would. the ibus I am sure is up there with a strong pale ale or ipa.
I am glad I got a chance to try this beer,

I was expecting something of a hop bomb actually, if the abv were a bit lower, Id call this an very good (and underrated) English session, with just enough nuance to be called classy.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
1902,"2008-06-25",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 16, 2008 Very fragrant, reminiscent of the aroma of a Double IPA or a fresh-hop harvest ale.  Flavor has sweetness and body is much like a sticky resinous hop-bombing IxPA.  The hop character is very played up in pretty much every aspect except for flavor, which is medium-strong-hoppy by mainstream standards.  Definitely worth coming back to, especially at the modest price.  I recommend this, and the RB average has dropped the ball on this somewhat.  Something of this quality would get around a 3.7 RB average in a true, fair blind tasting.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

1902,"2008-05-23",2.9,"A simple beer, and likely enough for avowed hop heads.  I am less convinced, though the stores price makes it a certain acquisition.  The pour quickly produces a lumpy though thin and light head.  The body is a cloudy amber - a standard paint job in the beer world.  The aroma certainly elicits hops - fresh hops, too.  Actually, imagine that when you win the big game, instead of having a barrel of gatorade dumped on you, its a barrel of freshly harvested hops.  Not bad for most, but very bad for those of us that find purified hop astringency to be less than pleasant.  Tongue wrenching.  This hops is solidly dedicated to that bitter aspect, no counterbalanced grain of sugar here.  Nosing around the flavor one can find a slight nuttiness, and maybe a whisper of honey, but one wrong move and BOOM, like a landmine you hit another patch of spicy hops.  What I found most interesting was that, under these circumstances I typically associate the hops bitterness with grapefruit.  But even that, the fruit, seems to have been forcibly stripped and tossed away, again leaving only the essence of hops bitterness.  It would be magical if it werent so difficult to drink.  Drink at a snails pace, or be ready for taste bud restorative surgery.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

1902,"2008-05-02",2.8,"Pours with a frothy, initially fat-two-finger thick, light tan colored head into my 25cl tulip glass.  The beer is a lightly hazy, ruddy amber color, but shows a bright, almost clear, copper color when held up to the light.  The aroma is much more malt focused than I was expecting; ample notes of sweet caramelized malt, toasted bread notes, a biscuit maltiness and a sweet grain cookie character are all quite prominent.  This does have some hop character, it just plays a secondary role to the malt; hop driven aromas of currants, a rich earthy spiciness and a light resinous hop character all seem to accentuate the malt character more than jumping out on their own.  This has quite a pleasant aroma, it is just surprisingly malt focused for a beer with the word hop on so prominent a display on its label.

Sweet malt character is the first thing I notice in my first sip, but this is fairly light bodied, though it does have a slightly sticky malt texture to it.  The hops kick in with a resinous, herbal hop flavor and persistent, lightly astringent bitterness.  The hops play more of a role in the flavor than they did in the aroma, but they are still second fiddle to the ample, sticky malt character.  The sweet malt and hop character combines to create a jam-like, berry flavor here.  I do like the finish of this brew as the hop character gets a bit herbal, with a nice floral accent & light bitterness that helps to wash the mouth of the excessive crystal malt.  It is only an attempt, as the hop character really doesnt have a chance of standing up to the malt here; caramelized malt sugars, ample biscuit-like flavors and an astringent grain husk edge that though light, just adds to the crystal malt domination.

The crystal malt notes play a bit too big of a role here, they completely overwhelm the aroma and even make a significant attempt at washing out the flavor of this brew.  Really not all that bad, but if you are sensitive to excessive crystal malt usage this may be a little too much.  Strangely, though the aroma is much more malt dominated than the flavor, it is the flavor where the malt just becomes too excessive.

According to the label, they consulted one of Charlie Papazians favorite English IPA recipes, ""gave it (their) own twist and (they were) over the moon with the results.""

The aroma was quite enjoyable.. strong alcohol-fueled herbal undertones with toffee, floral, and lighter fruity notes above.. caramel shows up and builds with warmth.  The flavor was a bit brash.. sharper boozy notes get in the way of the nice bready grains, and they amplify the strong herbal, floral, and fruity hops a bit too much.. really bitter and boozy in the end.. not bad, just unbalanced.  Thicker-bodied and sharp on the palate with a tacky, bitter finish.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1902,"2007-11-17",2.9,"bomber. pours copper/amber. minimal head.  im not sure of the hops used, but they seem fresh, though the aromatics are a bit less than par.  it smells like hop resin, sour citrus,  and candied lemon peel.   the taste is a bit spicy, slightly bitter, and nuances of pine and cedar.  still a bit of that sour citrus candy in the taste.  finishes fairly smooth, nothing lingering.  its very easy to drink.  i should have bought another one.","Murfreesboro, Tennessee, USA","andyhite"

The aroma is of pungent floral hops that are strong enough to put out real floral hop spiciness. It also leans toward smelling wet hopped too. I cant pick up any malts hiding behind the hop bouquet. The taste starts with pine and floral hop bitterness. It may not be pine creating the extra bite to the bitterness but rather an intense floral spicy hop bitterness. Nicely done too. Other big floral hop beers Ive had dont have manage to create the balance with the aid of this unique bitter hop spice kick. Once the whole hop experience has wrapped around the tongue a few times a rich pale and slightly grainy maltiness comes to the surface to squelch out the hops.

1902,"2007-06-10",3.5,"Bottle from Kingdom Liquors Brandon, Fl. Pours a clear copper with a small but lasting white head that leaves good lacing. Aroma of floral and earthy hops with a nice light malty sweetness. Taste is the same as aroma with a nice earthy hop flavor. Medium thin mouth feel with a well balanced bitterness. Very good.","Florida, USA","afterglow"
1902,"2007-06-07",3.9,"Well I liked this quite a bit, it reminds me some of Rogue Brutal Bitter, which I like. Anyway, the nose was hop dominated, initially lemon-citrus focused, with hints of pine, but it became more floral. If Im not crazy, these were Goldings hops in large quantity. Touches of biscuit hiding beneath it.  Towards the darker side of amber, full head. Flavor was crisp and very clean, it may be in English in inspiration, but this was an american yeast. Caramel and biscuit malts, resiny and floral hops. Finish was balanced. Palate was medium. Not sure of the strength, but this bomber went down easy and fast, and I could feel a little something when I was done.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
1902,"2007-05-28",3.5,"Bomber poured a clear amber with a small lasting light amber head. Aromas of carmel, biscuit, citrus, earthiness and light pine. Palate was light bodied and crisp yet smooth. Flavors of carmel, earthiness and citrus with a crisp lingering moderatly bitter finish.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
1902,"2007-05-22",2.8,"Clear and light copper-amber. Thin, patchy head. Decent lace. Somewhat rich texture; fitting carbonation level. Didnt really care for the malt flavors much. Made me think of alcohol-soaked grains, bread crust and peanut shells. Hops were like resinous spruce tips. Citrus aromas circled within my olfactories. Not necessarily a bad beer, but it didnt mesh with what I like.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
1902,"2007-05-21",3.5,"Hmm, I had a different experience then those below. Strong hop nose, pine resin and citrus. Malts were toasty and provided a nice warm melted caramel flavor that meshed well with the bready english malts. Not balanced, but probably never tried to be, but a unique flavor for what could have been just another IIPA.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
1902,"2007-05-13",1.8,"Bottled. Beer is clear, medium amber with a moderately sized, white, frothy head. Diminshes mostly.<P>
The aroma is a pop in the nose. Hoppy with aggressive moderate notes of pine and resin (in that order), repellant rotting grass clippings, hay, lighter notes of grapefruit oil; Glimmers of light notes of malt (toasted grain and caramel) escape from underneath.<P>
The flavor is moderately sweet, lightly bitter, lightly acidic with a long, lightly bittersweet, trace acidic finish. Rotten, dirty notes in the rets.<P>
The body is light, the texture is watery and the carbonation is lively.<P>","Boulder, Colorado, USA","luckygirl"
1902,"2007-05-13",2.2,"UPDATED: NOV 10, 2007 Bottle. Head is initially small, frothy, off-white, mostly diminishing. Body is medium amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain, husks), moderately hoppy (resin), lightly yeasty (dough), with light notes of cat urine and vegetables. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter, unclean. Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation.  Got a very chemically/vegetal sample the first time (from bomber) and promised myself Id give it another chance (this time from a 12oz).  It still does have some of the same problems, but it isnt as overwhelming this time.  The Pine Sol -like hop aroma dosent help though, nor does the husky/grainy character. Not a very good beer, but certainly not as bad as the first sample.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
