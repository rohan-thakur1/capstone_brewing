2192,"2016-12-07",2.5,"Keg at the brewery, 8/20/16. Clear copper, thin head, poor retention. Aroma of toffee, caramel, molasses. The taste is caramel toffee, bitter hops. Medium bodied.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
2192,"2016-09-03",2.6,"Draft. Amber pour, it is on the thin end of an oktoberfest, caramally, not too malt heavy which is nice but it isnt that great.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
2192,"2011-09-03",2.9,"Tap at the brewpub. Clear amber pour with a small white head. Smells like an alt - some bread/caramel with slight hop. Semi-creamy palate. Caramel and bread taste.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"
2192,"2011-08-26",3.0,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear amber with a white head that dissipate yo the edges and remains thin. Aroma has sweet grains with a bit of bread and a bit of sweet fruit. Flavor stats with sweet with grains and hay with some caramel in the finish.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
2192,"2011-05-14",2.3,"On tap at Rowlands Calumet Brewery.  Clear amber with a thin beige head.  Aroma of caramel, toffee, toasted malt, swamp water and mild butter.  I clean my palate between each beer and yet the buttery diacetyl seems to keep coming back beer after beer.  This one just tasted wrong with butter, light caramel and something else strange, perhaps infection.  I see all the good ratings for their beers and know better days for Rowlands once existed.  Unfortunately, I did not get to try their beers ""back in the day"".","Oak Creek, Wisconsin, USA","esjaygee"
2192,"2010-08-30",2.7,"On tap at the brewpub, pours a clear deep scarlet with little head.  Aroma is of wort, taste is of malty wort with a semi-bitter finish.  Not a huge fan, but not bad.","Annandale, Virginia, USA","Scubatrip"
2192,"2010-05-23",2.9,"On tap at WI Microbrewers Fest.  Pale orange in color.  Mostly caramel malts in the aroma.  Very little hop aroma.  Taste again is mostly malts that lack impact.  Very little on the bitterness end.  I love a good Oktoberfest, unfortunately, this is not it.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
2192,"2010-01-13",1.7,"Thanks to Hopscotch for this growler. Unfortunatelty, its a big butter bomb. Nice dark gold pour. Aroma is a big fatty stick of butter. Taste is pretty bad, too. I know it could be better, Ill have to wait for a fresh growler.","Orlando, Florida, USA","dchmela"
2192,"2009-07-26",3.5,"Growler fill from the brewpub - Overall a fine beer and one that I could drink a decent amount of. Pours dark amber with a small cream-colored head. The aroma is sweet caramelly malt, and the flavor is the same. Its weird though--while the flavor is sweet, its not syrupy or cloying. Its a bit grainy too, and the finish doesnt hang around too long. Id like to try this one again, though it might be awhile til Im through Chilton again.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
2192,"2008-09-15",3.4,"Growler courtesy of Skyview.  Copper color with a medium head.  Light, buttery aroma.  Extremely earthy taste.  Strong grain, a little corn and some mushroom.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
2192,"2008-08-19",3.2,"I liked it, but like many of the beers I tasted at Rowlands, i feel they innacuratrely represent their styles. Clear dark reddish colour, medium sized tan head. Aroma is stern, dark fruit and carmel. Subtle caramel and bread in the taste. soft sweet lightly carbonated mouth feel. Slightly watery in the finish.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","phishpond417"
2192,"2007-11-21",4.1,"One of the better Marzens Ive had, and especially good for a craft brewery.  From the tap at the brewery.  Pours a nice clear orange-amber color, with a darkish head.  Light and sweet, with just a hint of caramel malts.  Not overpowering on the caramel like lots of (too many) Marzens.  Very good!","Appleton, Wisconsin, USA","prosqtor"

2192,"2007-05-01",3.7,"Thank you skyview for sharing once again.  Nice malty nose on a light colored beer.  Heavy malty beer with faint hint of raisins.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
2192,"2007-04-28",3.6,"My thanks to Skyview. Light and malty, and a good change of pace after a night of heavy beers.  This is standard, it doesnt push any limits, but pulls off the style very well with great balance, rich malt, and a heavy palate, but still very drinkable.  Brown color, and well carbonated.  Served from a growler.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
2192,"2007-04-17",3.9,"Fourth stop during Wisconsin Trip #2 and one of 11 brews offered at this small town brewpub at any time. This brew pours a clear dark amber with a white head and good lacing. Aroma has sweet hops, roasted chestnuts, caramel, and roasted barley malt. Taste is smooth, fruity and creamy. Alcohol seem a little high, but that is all part of the characteristics of a good Oktoberfest. Surpisingly, this Oktoberfest is still on tap at the brewery well into April 07.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
2192,"2006-09-29",4.5,"Got a growler and headed up to the Door for a weekend of camping in Peninsula St Park.  That growler tasted mighty fine by a late summer fire.  Nice dark amber-brown.  Huge frothy head aroma of chestnuts, oak, persimmons, with a sprightly  phenolic zip.  A wee heavy for the style, but pushes the envelope enough to make it memorable.    Very round and happy in the mourh.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","jewedekind"
2192,"2006-05-02",4.0,"tap at the brewpub. poured a nice dark amber with a white head. malt nose. so sweet and good. the sweetness embraces my tongue. caramel notes that were great.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
2192,"2005-12-24",3.8,"Growler.  Poured a clear medium amber with a short white head.  Sweet caramel, toffee, spices, and fresh floral hoppage abound in the aroma... which becomes more nutty and roasty as the brew warms.  Hoppy bitterness first finds the tongue, followed by lots of caramel and toffee maltage.  Finish was sweet and dry, carrying through some bitterness and toffee.  Lower-carbonation and medium-bodied... smooth and deliberate across the tongue, surrounded by the well-placed floral.  Very good stuff.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
2192,"2005-10-11",3.4,"A nice fest.  Slightly maltier than most.  Easy going down.  Just what a fest should be.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","BCAR"
2192,"2005-08-09",3.5,"Slightly nutty, malty aroma.  Nicely malted flavor, has a decent kick of stemmy hops to boot.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
2192,"2005-08-06",3.3,"The beer has a bronzed brown body.  Toasted grains dominate the aroma.  This is the strongest flavored beers of the amber beers they have.  Marzen flavor.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
2192,"2005-06-26",3.6,"Chestnut amber in color with a creamy gray head.  Caramel leads the aroma, accompanied by some peanut shells and a sweet, distant caramel chocolate chew scent.  Overall, aroma is fairly reserved.  Nutty and sweet in flavor.  A careful balancing act is taking place here, but I feel the malts prevailing as they should.  Gainy, newly harvested wheat, some peat and light tan leather.  Traces of butterscotch and almonds linger in the background.  Sweet, nutty finish brings us back full circle.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
2192,"2005-05-22",3.2,"Very light flavor, but some good balance to it. Slightly orange caramel flavor. Pretty good flavor, just dont like the lack of it.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"
2192,"2005-04-10",3.6,"On tap at the brewery.  Darker amber color with a small light brown head and good lacing.  Aroma of wet raisins and some alcohol.  Flavor is a sweet licorice, raisin and toffee.   Interesting,  Ive never had an oktoberfest like this.  Medium palate.","Viroqua, Wisconsin, USA","hezron"

2192,"2003-04-28",3.4,"definately very respectable for the style, but there are better out there.  This one was way more malty than most, which is a kind of cool twist on this style.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
2192,"2003-03-09",3.3,"I wish that Bob hadn't pointed out the diacetyl flavors that are his trademark. A touch spicy but not a lot. After he did, many tasted very similar. Somewhere in between the Nut Brown and the Rye.","Roeland Park, Kansas, USA","cb"
2192,"2003-01-04",3.0,"Toffee?  Caramel?  Butterscotch doesnt seem quite right, Sean, but there sure is a blast of sweet malt in this beer.  Unsettling.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","brownalegirl"
2192,"2003-01-04",3.3,"Wow.  This thing is butterscotched to all hell - a malty monster of a fest with enough butterscotch candy intensity to rival the taste of Arcadias Whitsun.  It does eventually get around to some spicier, hoppier action, but is really so crazy sweet you need some good substantial brats and kraut to accompany.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
2192,"2002-12-29",4.0,"Nice fall orange color with a creamy head, erratic lace.  Fresh Baked bread & some caramelized malts.  Hints of vanilla & nuts.  As all of Bobs beers theres that great creamy mouthfeel and caramely sweet taste.  Hopped a bit more than the others, hints of spices and more bitter.  I love the balance.  Sweetened even more as it warmed.   My favorite Octoberfest so far.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","GermanBrews76"
2192,"2002-12-29",3.7,"Not only do I get to try a pile of Calumets, I get to add one!  Bobs winter seasonal is a spicy, nutty medium-brown lager with a great caramel/cinnamon/clove aroma and some good pie/nut flavors; finish is long and complex and surprisingly bitter.  One of Calumets best.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
2192,"2002-11-03",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2003 Very similar in character to the Dark...loads of sweet malt, fruity and tangy, with intriguing spice and sourness.  Mildly astringent with a solid hop presence.  This is much different than a typical, German-style marzen, and I'd agree it's more of a Vienna lager.  Still, a very well crafted and tasty beer.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
2192,"2002-10-21",4.2,"Great Festbier.  Sweet and malty with enough hops to fit the style.  Nice medium brown color and off-white head.  Good complexity and a smooth finish make this one of Calumets better beers.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
2192,"2002-05-10",3.8,"A nice lighter fest beer.  Munich malt dominates. More of a vienna style.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

2192,"2001-04-18",4.4,"Oktoberfest is Oktoberfest, but hot damn is this one 1/2 gallon jug to be savored and respected.  A very well-rounded amber brew.  The very slight hop prescence during the gulp gets amplified as the beer is swallowed, followed by a fruity, almost tangy aftertaste.  The nut prescence is apparent throughout the gulp.  Once again, Rowlands Calumet micro-brews stand up to most","Wisconsin, USA","Got Stout?"
2192,"2001-04-05",4.5,"A very good beer.  The brilliant amber color is very appealing, and it tastes excellent.  Everyone from Chilton should try it.  By the way, are you actually ever going to try it thealcoholic or did you just rate it to screw up the average.","Wisconsin, USA","The Friar99"

2192,"2001-03-26",4.6,"This beer makes me think of nuts.
The kind you eat.  Its color
is red to brown, it sort of tastes
like hickory nuts, and the after taste
is nuts and leaves you wanting more
nuts.  This is a good beer, but not
as good as Calumet Dark.
Love those 1/2 gallon jugs.","Whitewater, Wisconsin, USA","Blatz King"
