Clear pale blond beer, creamy small aery white head, unstable, non adhesive. Aroma: bit fruity, spicy, bit dry, funky touch. MF: soft carbon, medium body. Taste: pretty bitter, lemon rind, some grapefruit, funky touch. Aftertaste: lemon rind, funky, very soft, nice but not very complex. Very curious about how an Ohio brewery exposes their wort to the wild yeast and bacteria (not bacterias) from the Senne Valley.

It is slightly grainy--corn specifically--w/ subdued tartness for the style. I am not getting much funk or phenolics just straight acidity. Its lightly sweet, medium bodied w/ mild carbonation. There is some flight fruit character and maybe just a touch of bitterness in the finish.

4080,"2015-05-05",2.2,"Poured into a tulip. 2012 vintage. Like the Rivertown Gueuze I had a little while ago, the cap came off of this way, way, way too easily. While this beer may have been flat anyway, the gueuze should not have been.

3.5 A: Mildly hazed orange brown color. No head.

3.5 S: The nose on this is sharp and acidic. Loads of lactic acid with plenty of acetic underneath. Tangy and fruity with peach and apple. Melon and some vinous notes underneath. Hay and dry woody funkiness, but it doesnt hold a candle up to the acid. Oak without much tannic astringency.

1.75 T: Wow. On the pucker-scale, this one shoots right past mouth-puckering and straight to ass-puckering. Most of the time, the first sip makes a sour beer seem more sour than it is. Your palate needs a couple sips to acclimate back to sours. This beer does not apply. Its fully unbalanced with bracing acidity and unrelenting intensity. I can feel my tooth enamel dripping down my esophagus. If you can taste anything past the acid, you might say this beer is tangy and fruity. Again apple, peach, and vinous fruitiness. Hay and oaky woodiness. Its so damn sour that I cant keep it in my mouth long enough to discern any other flavors.

3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Not really any carbonation. Drinks like a thick water, which is a nice mouthfeel for a lambic.

1.5 D: If Im dead tomorrow then its probably because I finished the bottle by myself. Wholly undrinkable, even for the most seasoned lambic drinkers. Im not a sour noob, so Im not overreacting. This may be even less balanced that the Cantillon Kriek I had a while back. Brace yourselves, acid is coming.","Pennsylvania, USA","DavoleBomb"

4080,"2013-04-23",3.5,"750ml bottle, 2010 vintage. Been holding onto this one for a year or two. When I removed the wrapping from the top, I was surprised to find how saturated the cork was. Actually, it was the wettest cork ever. Broke in half as I pulled it out, and not in a dry way. Really wet and squishy, so strange. When I finally got the second half of the cork out, it made a loud pop, and gushed a bit. Head eventually fades to nothing, though. Medium-plus body, lighter, soft carbonation, more dry texture. Aroma is kind of just like wet laundry, or wet socks. Flavor is a lot better than the aroma, though. Oaky, tart, woody aroma. Kind of musty, but not in a bad way. Actually, the smell gets a lot more tolerable after it sits for a bit, and I take a few sips, getting used to it. Ive never had a beer from the unblended lambic style before, so Ive got no reference to compare this to... It seems like something might be off here (especially considering the state of the cork), but I cant say for sure.

Taste as with most lambics is a trait that comes after aroma and mouthfeel, specifically tartness.  Yes there is flavor, a mild citrus and bread, but the initial tartness shocks the taste buds and the dry finish completes the process.

The beer is really hazy and yellow hued, with a thin, white head. The aroma is really nice, with an authentic Belgian lambic vibe. Funky citrus, yeast, hay, straw.

The bottle says ""award winning"" but I cant figure out what competition this may have been victorious at. As a beer it isnt all that bad. As a lambic it falls completely short of expectations. Ive had berliner weisses with more sourness.

Aroma / Appearance - Strike one is the huge cascade of gushing foam that not only wasted the top few ounces but sucked all the yeast residue into the body. Instead of a clear orange what was poured into peoples glasses was a cloudy orange. White wine, vinegar, sweat socks, and lemon rinds are spot on for a lambic ... yet it still feels lacking. Maybe it is the overall mildness.

Flavor / Palate - Sour lemons, citrus, vinegar, and cheap white wine blend into a smooth easy to drink experience. The finish is a bit dry but lacks the true sourness that came from a Cantillon someone opened next. I would probably have finished the bottle if this were my choice for the night but neither do I regret the fact that about a third was left at the end of the tasting.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Tastes minerally and lactic tarte initially with some dry peachy hints and a floral finish.  Very drinkable.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"
4080,"2011-06-17",3.9,"Very relaxed and mellow. The malt still shines in this lambic. Notes of light white sugar and soft malt. Lighter acidity than expected. Only complaint is the massive amount of yeast that stirs so easily. If you dont pour this entire beer all at once it is just yeastville to the extreme. Very delicious. Oh, be careful with that cork...","Ohio, USA","cracklefish"
4080,"2011-06-11",3.7,"750 ml capped and corked bottle, 2010 vintage.  Served in a flute, the beer pours a hazy straw gold color with about a half inch white head.  Head retention is decent, and theres a small amount of lacing.  Aroma is lemon peel, oak, and some funk.  Its a nice but light aroma.  The brew tastes like tart apples, pears, lemon peel, vinegar, and some funk.  Nice lingering tart finish.  Mouthfeel/body is light/medium and its well carbonated.  I think this is a good brew, Id buy this again in the future.  Definitely worth a try.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

4080,"2011-05-21",4.0,"When I heard about this beer I thought it had to have been a mistake by the brewery that they tried to market as a lambic. Although all the rivertown beers I have tried have all been very good, none of them were very bold. This beer is a legit american style sour ale. It had a very nice acidic nose and flavor. It was very drinkable for the style and probably the biggest surprise I have had this year.","columbus, Ohio, USA","bgburdman9"
4080,"2011-05-14",3.5,"Reviewing this beer as an American Wild, not as a traditional lambic, as it would not stack up nearly as well when compared against Cantillon, 3F, etc.

Thanks to Eric for opening this bottle. Served in a Bruery tulip.

Pours a light straw-yellow color with a mild white head. The nose brings some light cheese and funk with a bit of acidity. The taste starts like a berliner with some mild grain and wheat plus a touch of acidity. Some mild peach and apricot character there. Light body and mild tartness with low carbonation. The nose brings some bready yeast as it warms. Mild acid in the finish. A really nice attempt and a solidly-drinkable brew, especially on a pretty warm evening.

4080,"2011-05-07",4.0,"Bottle at Troys.  2010. Hazy straw yellow with minimal head.  Tart, musty, dirty blanket, earthy aroma.  Great level of sour in this one.  Puckering but not over powering.  Grainy, straw flavors with apple cider and perhaps a light yeasty presence.  Very nice.  Quenching, light body.  Id drink this any time.  Finally!  Cinncinatti makes something good!","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

Sour lemon flavor a bit of maltiness and a sour vinegar finish thats rather thin. Way better than I was expecting from a brewery Ive never heard of, but could use some work on the body.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
