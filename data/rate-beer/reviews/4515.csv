4515,"2017-04-19",3.6,"Draft in a chalice glass. Appears pale gold with a dingy white head. Aroma is pretty good, although Id describe it as being a mixture of straw, lemon zest, and mildew. This beer finds a good balance between old and new world, where there is base of grainy/pale/cereal malt flavor intertwining with lemon rind. Its light, yet flavorful. A decent ber that veers from tradition moderately.","","balloonbuffoon"

Hard to pin down, this release mixes a little Old World with new in a blend that sparkles. Whatever is going on here defies categorization. If more breweries attempt anything similar I would certainly love to try them for comparisons sake.

Aroma / Appearance - Golden carbonated body bubbles with a crisp white head the color of bleached towels. Lemons, starchy yeast, and bright open hops float upwards with a focus on the citrusy feel of spring.

Flavor / Palate - A fresh feeling pilsener sparkles and immediately provides refreshment. An easy drinking body flows freely from start to finish. The dry finish then kicks it up a notch making me wish I had more than just a four once pour. With so many options in the local market it still manages to carve out a niche that makes it memorable.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
4515,"2015-06-19",4.0,"Can shared by jackl, 6/3/15. Hazy yellow, large foamy white head, good retention. Aroma of noble, grassy hops, pale malt. The taste is doughy malt, apples, noble hops. Medium bodied, well balanced, crisp, refreshing.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
4515,"2015-05-26",3.4,"Draught at the very nice, modern but charming and thoughtful brewpub, followed by a can two weeks later. Clear straw. Generous malt base makes for a sweet, round... not quite sugary, but almost borderline pilsner with a snappy, juicy fruity, citrusy, tropical hop presence whose deployment is kept aback by the strong maltiness, but whose soft, aromatic forward, neither resinous nor rough profile maintain a very high drinkability. Limited bitterness in spite of the high hop presence, they seem mostly the aromatic kind which enhances drinkability, but makes the chubby malts even more proeminent. It remains a highly drinkable offering, perhaps not as innovative as it claims to be and not quite up there with the likes of Jacks Abby, but at less than $2 a can, its a really good buy.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
4515,"2015-05-08",3.2,"This is a nice beer, though the branding/description is way too ambitious (there are 2000+ brewers in the U.S. now, and a good many of them are trying to brew interesting things....) Youve got here a solid pilsner on the sweeter side, and mild hopping that gives it a robustness but nothing akin to an American hop-influenced beer, of most any style. Still, fine, reasonably easy drinking. (on tap, Grand Central, St. Paul)","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

4515,"2014-12-19",3.7,"(can) Pours a clear golden color with a medium white head that really settles down quickly. Interesting aroma here. Theres some lemon, pizza crust, garden veggie dip, and a vague, unidentifiable citrusy component (well it could be clementine or tangerine). It also seems to try to be grassy, but doesnt quite make it. Little spiciness to the hops as well. Flavor is well composed, with some cracker (intensifying in the finish), light sweetness, citrus juice, little pine-like hit, and a fairly intense herbal spiciness that is matched up with a dry, crackery finish. Hints of mineral water as well. Mouthfeel is light and carb is right on. Overall this is a very solid pils that Ill gladly buy again when I get an occasional craving for the style.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

Aroma of noble grassy hops, golden grain malt, crystal, and a touch of lager yeast. Taste is medium bodied, citrus/grassy hop bitterness with some golden grain malt, field weed and a touch of fruit.

4515,"2014-07-26",4.2,"Clear metallic yellow. Orange marmalade, regal noble hops and ebullient tropical hops in the nose. Underlying crackery malt, black and white peppercorns. Grass clippings, farm, silage. True pils with extra, lovely stuff.
Tasting this is like being in the field, breathing in its rustic layers of old leaves and dry herbs. So crisp, and gently dusted with citrus pith. Apricot flesh and clementine are also lightly present, totally sufficient to supply a tantalizing juiciness against the dry grass and the buttery biscuit pils malt.
High carb snapping with bitterness makes for a taut, clear texture. This is nothing short of excellent; alive and authentic in every shade of its character.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"
4515,"2014-07-24",3.8,"4 or 5 oz. pour as part of a three-beer flight, on tap at the brewerys taproom. Consumed on 7-23-14. Pours a hazy, pale gold/straw with nearly white head. Looks good. Strong, floral, citric smell features grapefruit, orange, and lemon scents. Dry, citric flavor that reminds me of Victory Prima Pils in that it is a good pilsner using American hops. Pleasant, dry finish and aftertaste. Light body. Crisp and lively in the palate. Refreshing. Overall this is a really good pilsner that is worth seeking out. I could just as easily have given this a 4 as a 3.8, but I am trying to be tougher in my ratings.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
