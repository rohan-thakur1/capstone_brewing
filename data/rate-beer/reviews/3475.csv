Aroma is coffee and some slight grassy and seeds notes. Taste is coffee, vanilla, roasted malt, some bourbon notes and booziness. Same aftertaste. This is a very good beer, but bourbon notes are almost hidden by the coffee ones, which are overwhelmed in this beer in my opinion. I would prefer more balance between coffee and bourbon.

2017-03-13. 341 ml bottle (thx, Eric D.!). Bottled 2016-11-07. Aroma is lots of fruits and burnt bourbon barrel notes. Taste is the same with some bourbon, coffee, and chocolate notes. Quite hot and a little bit harsh. Burnt barrel, coffee, and chocolate aftertaste. Too much barrel character that dominates everywhere. Again not balanced variant, but it seems a little better than the previous one. Though, rating is same.

3475,"2016-07-30",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 17, 2016 Notes et commentaires basés sur une bière jeune de 5 mois. 
Apparence : Noire, beau col brun crémeux, rétention intéressante, dentelle qui saccroche, carbonatation plus faible. 
Nez : Café, chocolat, traces dalcool. 
Goût : Café, malt rôti, bois alcoolisé piquant important au début, satténue par la suite, amertume moyenne, peu ou pas sucrée, vanille, chocolat amer, voire poudre de cacao. Finale amère et boisée. 
Sensation : Corps moyen-plus, crémeuse, effervescence faible, longue finale sèche, réconfortante. 
Bref : Arômes du café et du malt très bien intégrés, lamertume est bien présente, mais juste là pour équilibrer, pour soutenir ces arômes grillés, torréfiés. Le vieillissement en fut apporte des notes très boisés, alcoolisées dans la même veine. Une fois de plus, lintégration et léquilibre sont au rendez-vous. Une BA Stout plutôt sèche qui ne tombe pas dans le sucre décadent et dans le dessert. Bravo!","Quebec, CANADA","Adamsville"

Brune foncée, qui oscille presque sur le noir, col est épais et crémeux nettement plus axé sur le moka que les autres versions offertes ce jour.
Arôme est intense et offre là une superbe palette deffluves toutes plus intenses les unes que les autres. Un Bourbon digne de ce nom savamment bien mis à profit, au contraire de nombreuses autres bières, avec une intensité olfactive au niveau du café sans pareil. Rétro ajoute une note de vanille presque de noix de coco. Le café est en retrait mais tjrs aussi bien utilisé.
Palais est tout aussi exceptionnel, le Bourbon est puissant sans verser dans le surfait. Retrouve un profil onctueux qui alterne entre douceur vanillée-boisée du chêne américain et un malt renforcé, chocolaté, pointe caramel avec un fini réchauffant des quais 10%.

Arômes de grains de café, vanille, bourbon, bois et toffee. En bouche, le bourbon est bien présent. On perçoit également du bois humide, café, chocolat au lait et de légères notes épicées venant de lalcool. La texture est douce, soyeuse et crémeuse. le corps est bien rond et procure une belle chaleur. Complexe et parfaitement balancée. Le fort goût de café présent dans la version originale est ici beaucoup plus subtil. La finale est longue et moyennement sucrée.

3475,"2015-04-19",5.0,"Bottle about 1 and a half years old from the November 2013. The smell is great, lots of bourbon, oak, coffee and chocolate. This beer is soo smooth, the texture is just perfect, full body, light carbonation, it just flows on your tongue. I love the original Péché Mortel, but the bourbon barrel gives it an additional complexity which is, in my opinion, very beneficial. Bourbon and oak flavours blend gracefully with the coffee. Along with those dominating flavours, I taste some slight chocolate notes, toastiness, sweet but not as much as other big bba imperial stouts that Ive had. The finaly is light warming alcohol with a mild coffee bitterness, and again, not too swee. The finish is dryer than one might expect. This is one of, if not, my favourite beer from any Quebec brewery. This beer is not too big, but just perfectly balanced and smooth. It gets to me every time, love it!","Quebec, CANADA","jonabea"
3475,"2015-04-18",5.0,"Tirée de la réserve spéciale 2013, la Péché Mortel bourbon figure parmi les chefs de file en matière de savoir-faire brassicole québécois. Il ne sagit pas simplement dune grande bière de dégustation, mais dun Phare en matière didentité et de raffinement.
Liquide Noire et habillé dune étiquette rouge. Minuit sonne - le Diable se réveille. Je pourrais passer des heures à contempler la robe noire et impénétrable de cet envoûtant liquide. La tête de la bière se dissipe rapidement, laissant ce dernier à vif et naffichant quun film huileux, témoignage du temps qui passe.
Nul besoin nest dapprocher le verre de mes frémissantes narines pour en respirer les arômes. Je suis, à distance, hypnotisé par ces grains de café rôtis et suis immédiatement plongé dans un rêve où je cuisine ces fameux grains sur un poêle à bois dans une vieille grange de campagne. Le bois - ce bois suintant le bourbon américain doù émanent des arômes de vanille et de tabac.Inutile de tenter de résister plus longuement... La force dattraction de ce trou noir est trop grande. Le liquide frémit au bord de mes lèvres brûlantes. Ce dernier nest pas encore dans ma bouche que je le goûte déjà. Les arômes dun riche café méditerranéen menvahissent avec une puissante douceur auxquelles je suis immédiatement soumis. Une main de fer dans un gant de velours. La chaleur, le corps, la finesse et lautorité de cette bière forment un quatuor orchestral des plus homogènes. Rien nest manquant et rien nest trop présent. Léquilibre est absolu et dune longueur en bouche quasi éternelle, laissant sur mon palais admiratif, le souvenir dune Grande Histoire dAmour...","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

3475,"2015-01-09",4.3,"341ml bottle with much thanks to mcberko. Labeled as 2013. Pours lovely opaque black with a short-lived tan head that dissipates to leave behind a ring of fine bubbles and some irregular lacing. Aroma is lovely -- milk chocolate and vanilla comes first, followed by a small dose of well-roasted coffee, and finishing with blackberries and dark fruit. Really impressive, balanced, inviting nose. Taste: Coffee is much more prominent in the mouth, but still wonderful balanced. Layers of chocolate, coffee, dark fruit, vanilla, and roast. There is sweetness, but instead of the syrupy heavy-handed sweetness Ive come to expect in barrel-aged stouts, the sweetness here is ... deeper, subtler, more nuanced, and balanced nice roast, bitter finish. The result is a taste that is rich, but comes across neither as overly sweet nor particularly bitter. So yeah, I basically just used a lot of words to reiterate ""balanced,"" which Id already said. Expert wordsmith I am. Finishes somewhat dry with warming alcohol in my belly (and on my tongue, now that I can step back and am not so enamored with the rest).

Chocolate and coffee, lots of boozy bourbon and wood, vanilla, dark fruit, molasses and caramel, roasted grain/burnt toast and a bit of smoke.

A - Pours pitch black with a small half finger tall tan head, quickly dissipating down to a thin film, leaving no lace at all on the glass. Rather dead if Im honest.


S - Smells of deeply roasted coffee, oak, vanilla, chocolate, caramel, dark roasted malt, warm bourbon booze. Still has quite a bit of coffee for its overall age, pretty impressive aroma.


T - Starts off with a mild coating sweetness - mainly the chocolate, vanilla and fresh toffee - quickly being joined by the warm bourbon, woody oak and plenty of dark roast. Finish is pretty dry thanks to all the roast and booze, lingering long after the finish.


M - Heavy body with moderate to low carbonation. This is definitely a big beer but the feel kind of got away from it. If it could be bumped up a bit this one would be money.


O - I had wanted to try this one for awhile and I am glad I finally got to try it. It still packs plenty of the base flavors and the bourbon is a complement rather than the star, as it always should be. I would love to have this again.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

3475,"2014-05-11",4.3,"Bière noire comme la nuit, aucune lumière ne peut la traverser, parfaite opacité, effervescence difficile à observer, mais qui semble moyenne, surmontée dun col presque aussi brun que la bouteille doù il provient, moyennement large, mais très dense, mousseux, collant et persistant. Arômes dominants de torréfaction, de boisé et dalcool. Beaucoup de café, expresso, léger chocolat noir, fût de bois, bourbon, fumée, tourbe, léger vanille. Je crois également déceler une odeur de pâtisserie, ou de levure à pain. Beau nez, belle intensité, bonne complexité. En bouche, pétillement presque inexistant, mais breuvage très lourd, très onctueux. Cest soyeux, moelleux et velouté au palais! Au goût, je suis dabord fort étonné par la douceur de cette bière par rapport à la Péché Mortel de base, une bière que je trouve passablement «agressive». Plus chocolatée quau nez, ça fait très café-dessert avec des saveurs évidente de bourbon, de boisé, de fumée et de vanille, le tout semblant être enrobé dune riche pâtisserie. Contrairement à la Péché Mortel de base, presque aucune amertume, pas de saveurs de brûlés, excellente intégration des saveurs entre elles. Bien intense en bouche, belle complexité, excellente bière, bel «upgrade» par rapport à la version de base.","Longueuil, Quebec, CANADA","pumpkinhead2"

In other words, a lovely aroma with lovely coffee. Very smooth bourbon character lending some warmth, backed with moderate oak & vanillin from the barrel. Bourbon is quite tame on the palate... Lots of oily coffee, a little ashy bitterness leading into a bigger, creamy sweetness. Roasted malts, chocolate, wood, & very timid booziness.

Thanks to MartinT for sharing this at a tasting at the Craft Beer Company in Clerkenwell. One of the clear stars of the night I knew it would be excellent because it is based on an already world class beer. There was no disappointment either. Im not sure of the availability of this one but if I ever have friends going to Montreal I am going to ask them to pick some up.

Aroma / Appearance - The oily black base has been enhanced by aging in bourbon barrels. The sticky tan head and legs are like sheets of dirty ice sliding down the sides of a car window. Chocolate, plums, coffee, and traces of vanilla balance out a rich bouquet. The booziness is evident yet does not come across as distracting at all.

Flavor / Palate - Silky smooth and smoky, the first sip reveals a creamy rich body. Chocolate, plums, anise, and coffee alternate for main focus in a deep and flavorful blend. The barrel aging is evident yet does not ruin a solid beer with overly vanilla or oaky notes. This feels less like a money grab and more like an attempt to play with the evolving trends of the brewing culture.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Served side by side with the standard Péché Mortel.

The beer is dark brown with a small, beige head that leaves almost no lacing on the snifter. The dominant aromas are oak and bourbon, followed by a roasty, coffee presence. The flavor follows suit. The delectable coffee character I enjoy so much in the standard version is a bit overrun by the dominant bourbon barrel flavors. That said, this is still a very tasty beer. A nice, warming finish shows a bit of the alcohol. While this was most definitely a nice treat, I would have to give the nod to the plain ol Péché Mortel.

3475,"2012-12-19",4.1,"Thanks goes to Mike for the brew. Apologies goes to those who may have wanted in - Im out of beers and Ive had a heroin itch to drink this sucker. Poured out a beer that was contained within the bottle that I opened. LOL - First line of BlackIPAs review = gold. Heavy coffee aroma, a not-quite-thick aroma of coffee nearing a filter smell or whatever - which is not saying anything bad. Saying something bad would be like this: this stank reminds me of my junk after I popped out of pink socking a tranny. Unfortunately that wasnt the case or didnt happen - take your pick... dark choco, thick dark lightly smoky salt on a very gentle soft long smelling around the rim... soothing vanilla, the colour purple, no smoke now, anaheim peppers.. that seems pretty odd but I cant quite shake that thought. As it warms the chocolate softens into a darker borderline milk version - no lactose thoughts.All of that needs to be mined out of the coffee/ choco shell. The taste is superb with a mild burn which bits and never lasts but the heaviness of the flavours do. Choco, licorice (its there somewhere), a well blended mess of the choco, heavy non-sweet roast, coffee thing. Vanilla, I was going to say zero fruit but I may have forced myself to consider something orange. Sucking on my teeth is interesting and I cannot quite figure out the flavour aside from the bacteria poop from a day of ignoring brushing. This is not overly complex but its 4 knuckles of a full fist of flavour. Ashy. I have killer breath now. HIghly enjoyable beer that could be a sipper or a full out get drunk on multiple beer chugfest. The subtle aromas are the clear winner of this beer. This is better than the regular version but Im not about to compare grades. I like it cuz its not all about being bluntly barrel aged.

Toward the end, a hint of coffee turns into bitter coffee grounds, which I could really do without, but this finishes the sip.

The body is a little bit lighter than what I would ideally want from a 9.5% bourbon barrel stout.  There is a noticeable dry nature to this beer from the barrel, especially compared to the base beer.  The coffee imparts a somewhat acrid mouthfeel as well, and it is grainy throughout.

I would have expected barrel aging Péché Mortel would have made a great beer even better, but it simply is not the case.  I would rather have the regular version, and it is conveniently much easier to come by as well.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

3475,"2012-07-29",4.5,"I received a 2010 vintage 341ml bottle in a trade with a blogger in Quebec (thanks, Marc!). I poured it into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Black as night body with a brown, soapy head which is fairly quick to dissipate, but does leave a bit of lacing and never completely evaporates.

Smell: Black licorice and black coffee dominate the nose. Interesting synergy of sweetness and bitterness. A hint of bourbon sweetness and smoke as well.

Taste: A lot of craft beer enthusiasts hate the ""trend"" of bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts. But if the result is a beer that tastes this great I dont see a problem. I liked but didnt love the original Dieu Du Ciel Peche Mortel, but now its at least a candidate for conversation for contention with Hall of Famers like Founders KBS and Firestone Walker Parabola. Massive coffee flavor and accompanying bitterness right from the start, plus an underlying taste of black licorice which imparts both a confectionary sweetness and a touch of astringency. Dark chocolate begins to emerge after a few sips and becomes so prominent that the beer would be better classified as a mocha stout than a coffee stout.

The bourbon character is noticeable, though. Theres a subtle vanilla flavor that emerges on the second half along with a burst of straight up boozy heat and rubbing alcohol taste right as it finishes. You can call it distracting,  but Id consider it part of the character (its easily tolerated). The aftertaste contains a faint coffee bitterness and a slightly sticky/cloying black licorice taste. But despite all that its actually relatively clean considering whats in the beer. A delicious and impressive palate all around - but Im not quite sure it was worth the equivalent of $33 I spent on it in an international trade.

Drinkability: Any barrel aged imperial stout is something to handle with care, and while Dieu Du Ciel Peche Mortel Bourbon Barrel Aged is far from the strongest beer Ive ever had at 9.5% ABV, its still quite strong after two years in the bottle. Theres definitely a noticeable alcohol presence in the palate and an accompanying warmth in the throat after each swig. The carbonation is low enough to make it go down smooth, but its far from tepid, too. A fantastic beer  for a special occasion considering how rare and expensive it is.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
3475,"2012-07-27",3.8,"Thanks to Tommy for sending a bottle my way!  Pours out a fairly viscous, deep dark brown with decent tan foam.  Aroma on this beer is quite nice - tons of fresh bitter coffee, a touch of vanilla and bourbon, and some rich chocolate malt.  Flavor is not quite as nice as the aroma indicates - still lots of coffee, but its a touch weaker and more bitter than in the regular peche.  The barrel characteristic is subtle, but noticible.  The flavor has all the right pieces, but for whatever reason doesnt come together as well as in my favorite BA coffee stouts (bourbon county, KBS).

First thing noticeable on the nose is the strong coffee, which havent been muted by the barrels. Then some woody oak presence, slightly smoky / peaty notes and then the bourbon. Flavour reveals a complex bourbony-heavy body, though not too overbearing to diminish the base beers complexity. The coffee notes are still certainly present, followed by bourbon notes, wood, and loads of alcohol. The aftertaste is dominating the barrels, with a noticeably burning alcohol sensation.

Rating #3800 ... they seem to be coming slower and slower these days:  I just want to DRINK beer, it seems.  My notes were somewhat sparse on this one, and they concentrated on the mouthfeel, which was magnificent:  The aroma and taste were classic Peche M (deep roast, espresso, herbal bitterness, lactic tartness, alcohol, anise yadda yadda yadda) overlaid powerfully but not overwhelmingly with astringent dry vanilla/oak bourbon - it impartly a slipperly astringent slickness to an already memorable palate - I remember it sliding down wickedly easy, but it was a sipper for sure;  I took my time, and not just because I was approaching burn-out after two days of festival drinking, a huge plate of poutine, and a annoying long walk/cab ride to find Brouhaha.

3475,"2009-06-25",4.7,"In short: Our beloved roasted Péché Mortel with a moderate barrel character adding some complexity
How: Tap at Brouhaha, Montreal
The look: Black body topped by a small long-lasting tan head
In long: Weve all know the regular Péché Mortel so Im just gonna describe how this one differs from the original.  A little less roasted, roasted coffee beans almost as present, the powdery cacao/chocolate of the regular are more regular black chocolate in the barrel age, some woody notes not present in the original, subtle vanilla touch added, is a little more round and a little less roasted, a little more boozy than the original.  Overall the differences between the regular Péché Mortel and this Bourbon Barrel aged are not flagrant.  This is not like the Speedway Stout and the very different over-barrel-aged disappointing BA Speedway.  With the Péché Mortel the barrel presence is moderate and the most of the original beer character remain in the Barrel Aged version.  The regular remains more drinkable because of its dryer, more roasted and less boozy character.  However what this Bourbon Barrel Age loses in drinkability it gains in complexity and this what makes it imho a slightly superior beer over the original.  The regular Péché Mortel remains one of the favourite Imperial Stout, probably in my top-10.  But this Bourbon Barrel Péché Mortel is now my #3 Imperial Stout behind the Expedition and the Darkness.  Ive had many glasses (too many) of this fantastic beer at Brouhaha anniversary party.   You may hear a story from that night of me dancing on a table on a Abba wearing only my socks and with my Tommy Hilfiger underwear on my head.  This story is false.  They were Calvin Klein.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

3475,"2009-06-16",4.7,"Thanks to Mark at Brouhaha in Montreal- got the last 2 glasses out of the barrel with oteyj. Beautiful pitch black pour with a small creamy tan head. Aroma is fantastic- holds lots of coffee, cream and roasted malt, like the original Peche Mortel, but the bourbon presence is evident, along with a touch of vanilla sweetness. Flavor is wondrous: starts with heavy coffee, bitter chocolate, and immense amounts of cream. The bourbon comes in at the finish, with a fiery but smooth burn. Malt character is excellent; complex and rich. Palate is epic, creamy, thick, and full, and the alcohol is perfectly placed on the tongue. Vanilla and caramel mixes with the bourbon to create an entire second tier to the flavor that pairs extraordinarily well with the first tier of cream, coffee, and chocolate. Unbelievable brew, one of my favorites of all time.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
3475,"2009-06-16",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 24, 2009 On tap at Brouhaha. Poured into a tulip. Jet black pour with a beautiful tight tan foam. I literally got one of the last pints from the keg (Thanks Mark!), but the head was excellent regardless. Aroma is bursting with coffee and vanilla. Slight bourbon notes evident, but nearly slip under the radar. Imparts the perfect amount; not too strong or overly boozy, but certainly noticeable and welcome. Dark chocolate and cream sneak in as well to form an excellently rounded and multi-faceted malt character. Flavor is a blast off coffee, dark chocolate, and bitter roasted malt. Again, bourbon is noticeable in the finish and lingers making its present known ever so slightly. Boozyness makes itself slightly more up front than other Peches Ive had, though I dont think the ABV is any higher. Again, this facet is welcomed. Palate has a heavenly creamy texture that is extremely viscous, but surprisingly drinkable. I could have sessioned this if there was any more left, but alas... Incredible well put together and masterfully balanced. An exquisite quaff indeed.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"

This beer is everything Peche was with a litte more - it is seems to be fuller bodied and the mouthfeel is perfect.  Honestly, after having Beach Geek Brunch last month and now this, I would be hard pressed to choose between the two.  I did not find this to be too much by the end - in fact, I had a second glass.

3475,"2009-06-09",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 14, 2012 2012-06-08. Black body with a very nice brown head. Big sweet bourbony aroma, sweet vanilla, muted dark malt. 7++ Flavour is similarly quite bourbony, sweet dark malt. Vanilla bourbon character lingers long into the aftertaste. Bitterness grows and is a bit sharp in the finish by the end of the glass. I dont really get much coffee character out of it. Smooth full bodied palate. 4++ Pretty solid, bourbon character is just a bit too strong for me, but it maintains the richness of Peche. Blend this 3:1 with regular Peche or Deese Nocturne and I think it would be amazing. The previous sample I had of this was clearly misrepresented (perhaps just an aged version of Peche?), as the bourbon character here is orders of magnitude greater than what I was served before.  8/5/7+/5/15-16 On tap at DDC, Montreal
2009-06-06. Black body with a huge creamy brown head. Massive coffee aroma, fresh coffee dominates over pretty much everything else but its nice somehow, even as a non-coffee drinker. (8+) Flavour is also coffee dominant, dry bitterness it actually seems like a lot more coffee and more bitter than I recall it being before. Light boozy undertones at times. Touch of wood? Not much, it might even be my imagination really. Coffee is rich but starts to be a bit much by the bottom of the glass. (8+) Smooth medium to full body is very smooth but feels less like it is on nitro than usual. (Im curious to know how it was being served.) (4+) Very good even for a non-coffee drinker like myself. I didnt really notice a lot of oak influence on it to be honest, but then I was kind of excited to try it, perhaps I finished it before it warmed up enough to truly reveal itself. Good stuff however you look at it.  8/5/8/4/18 On tap at the brewpub, Montreal","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
3475,"2009-06-06",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2017 My Bottom Line:
Péché Mortels usual rich tiramisu coffee cake nose is now rendered more complex by well integrated droplets of silky vanilla and oaken alcohol for a masterful, if not serious, sipper of an Imperial Stout.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy veil of foam lingers atop the jet black.
-The body is sooo luxurious (yet not obese).
-The subtle fruitiness of the vanilla bourbon notes is cleverly blended into the base beer. The barrel aging job (and the subsequent blending) was expertly done.
-While I like to think that the regular Péché Mortel is actually quite drinkable when on nitroed tap, I wouldnt be able to say the same for this one. This barrel-aged version is for meditative drinking only. And so, it might even bring spiritual ecstacy as well...Its that good.
