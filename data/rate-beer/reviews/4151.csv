Full-bodied with a slick mouthfeel and an inkling of carbonation. The flavor is moderately sweet and lightly tart, accompanied by big-time berry fruitiness. This is basically the same as the still version, but has far less methanol in the nose. World class mead here!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

4151,"2015-02-21",3.6,"Looks like slightly effervescent red wine. 
Very berry, as expected given the 15% berry content. Sweet but not cloying. Exceptional fruit flavor. Sparkling version is subtley but notably better than the still version. The feel is better although the sweetness, which was marginally too high in the still version, seems just a touch higher here. Again, the berry flavor is the strong point.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"

Taste is light raspberry tartness followed by a burst of juicy berries mixed in some honey sweetness, finshes slightly dry with a sweet red wine like aftertaste, carbonation is minimal but there. This is world class stuff.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","kbudd19"
4151,"2015-02-13",4.2,"Big thanks to Dak for sending me this gem. Sharing it with a few people - slightly regretting that decision as this really is wonderful. Deep hazy purple. So thick that the clear bottle is also stained purple. Jammy honey floral nose. Fruit explosion, dry honey finish. Some alcohol heat on the finish as well.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
4151,"2014-05-25",4.2,"Disclaimer -- this carbonated version arrived with some loss in the bottle due to outgassing in transit. That said, There was still plenty of carbonation in both bottles, although one needed a couple of days to recover from the wine shock. Therefore, my rating is likely lower than it could be -- will re-rate when Im able to try locally or get a capped bottle shipped instead of a swing top.

This is a variant of batch two of Superstitions Marion Berry mead. Batch one was released in spring of 2013, and it was a tremendous mead. Superstition set the bar even higher for this batch, and they delivered.

The mead pours dark purple, with some translucence -- shocks people with preconceived notions of mead being, well, honey-colored. Welcome to the world of melomels...The aroma hits you as soon as you pop the top. It wafted throughout the kitchen -- everyone at our tasting turned to see where the jammy smell was coming from. Taste delivers on the smell...huge amounts of balanced tart/sweet dark fruit, complimented by the carbonation. The finish lingers for a long time before falling off and inviting you to take another sip -- quaffability is definitely enhanced by the carbonation, as you can end up drinking it really fast -- its that good.

Last years Marion still mead was my favorite from Superstition -- this years ups the ante. An exceptional effort from the team.","New York, USA","tchaos"
4151,"2014-04-20",5.0,"Honey wine fermented with a blend of Honey wine fermented with a blend of Marion berries, raspberries, and blueberries. This is a sparkling version of the Marion berry. The bubbliness makes all the flavors just pop. Deep dark purple color. Sweet berry flavor. Perfect mead","Alabama, USA","thebitterendaz"
4151,"2014-04-15",4.2,"Bottle share courtesy of Dak, thanks! It pours with a deep dark purple to rosy red body. Nice. The aroma offers up rich berry notes, some earthy berry and a bit of sweet red grapes. The taste begins with rich sweet currant like berry notes that ramp right into a pretty rich nectar like sensation. As this moves to midway more and more slick sweet rich honey notes murmur to the surface. To balance out the rich sweetness are shards of tannin like fruit skin tartness that adds just the right amount of balance. Yum. This ends with a modest dryness that tempts you into another sip. Yes!","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4151,"2014-04-14",4.2,"Pours a reddish/purple color with nice berry aroma a flavor on the honey back bone. This one is carbonated and it gives a nice fizzy sensation on the tongue that the other meads lack. I enjoyed this variant better than than the uncarbonated one. Another success for SM!","Arizona, USA","kcorum10"

4151,"2014-04-12",3.8,"Live rate! Bottle generously shared by daknole. Surprising pop even when re-opened. Deep burgundy pour that fades around the edges, but with nice legs. Smells of mixed, but predominately rasp, berries from a distance. Tart front of the palate that sweetens on the finish. Juicy and crisp.","Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","nbutler11"
4151,"2014-03-10",4.5,"Pours a deep purple red. The aroma is dripping with berry. It reminds me of walking into my grandmothers kitchen when she was canning jellies and jams. The flavor is no less spectacular. Loads of raspberry and blueberry, deep and earthy. Sweet and tart with a backing honey sweetness that keeps a perfect balance...nice. The mead is just so rich and smooth. There is a light zippy carbonation which helps to obtain maximum enjoyment. Without a doubt a world class mead.","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
