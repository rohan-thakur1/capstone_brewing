3276,"2016-06-17",3.8,"Location: 16 oz can purchased at the tap room
Appearance: Darker Brown. Finger of darker tan foam. 
Nose: Bourbon evocative hints of oak, caramel and vanilla. Bits of typical Belgian fruit aromas, stone fruits. 
Taste: as youd imagine a barrel aged tripel to come out, but very awesome. Sweeter fruit malt flavors backed and blending well with traditional bourbon oak and vanilla. Very tasty
Body: medium and smooth. 
Parting thoughts: A very nice beer. very costly. Worth it. label art is amazing.","Westerville, Ohio, USA","Panzuriel"
3276,"2016-05-09",3.8,"Sample at The Ohio Taproom during the ""Dayton Tap Takeover"" event on 04/21/2016. Dark brown color with a medium beige head that recedes gradually to a film. Small patches of lacing. Aroma of bourbon, coffee and yeast. Medium to full body with flavors of oaky bourbon, earthy yeast, coffee and malt. The finish is oaky and roasty with a bourbon and malt aftertaste. Pretty good overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
3276,"2016-04-03",3.8,"Draft to taster at cappys pour opaque dark brown with thin tan head. Nose boozy, vanilla Bourbon, sweet malt. Taste start with Bourbon, then some weedy green flavors, light bitter, then vanilla and red fruit in the finish. Finishes nice, but a little rough up front.","Loveland, Ohio, USA","drsordr"
3276,"2016-03-20",3.9,"16 ounce can. Boozier than 9% in taste. Sweet bourbon and coffee. No real carbonation. Medium mouthfeel. Nice.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
3276,"2016-03-16",3.6,"Draft at The Brass Tap - U Square, served in a flight. Pours a deep hazy brown color, kind of clear mahogany at the bottom, where the glass is slimmest, with a small khaki head that settles into a thin ring that leaves heavy lace in the glass. Notes of vanilla, cocoa, brown sugar, oak, tobacco, soy, and bourbon. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a rich, coating mouthfeel thats sweet but hits the umami receptors while tamping down on the richness of the base. Like their other barrel-aged stuff, it leaves a bit to be desired and things dont meld together as youd hope. But theres plenty of intrigue here.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3276,"2016-03-05",4.1,"16 ounce can, canned on 02/09/16. Served in a tulip, the beer pours a very dark brown color with about an inch tan head Head retention and lacing are both decent enough. Aroma is nice, the brew smells like chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla, bourbon, coffee, and some dark fruit. Taste is similar to the aroma, but with the addition of some woodiness, banana, sweet spiciness and roasted malt. Seems more stout-like to me than a tripel, but Im not complaining. Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its creamy and a little coating with low/moderate carbonation. I think its a good overall brew, glad I picked up this one! $17.99 a 2-pack.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
3276,"2016-03-02",4.0,"Draft to taster at Dutchs. Looks good for the style; a lightly translucent dark cola with beige head at dissipates into thin lacing pretty quickly. Smells good too; chocolate, coffee, oak, and roast with a decadent malt backbone. Tastes like it smells with a bit of yeast and honey as well. Less coffee roast, but still good. Mouthfeel is medium full-bodied. A BIG step up from the base that redefines a Tripels capacitities.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
3276,"2016-02-28",3.9,"Draft to taster at the Madtree Winter Bonanza. Pours dark brown to black in color with a small to medium sized beige head. The aroma and flavor have an interesting blend of increased coffee and dark chocolate, bourbon, wood, with more traditional tripel notes like, banana, citrus, sweet malts, honey, brown sugar, and Belgian yeast. I liked it, but Im still not sure about the $18+ dollar price tag for a 2 pack of 16 oz cans from an up and coming brewery. I am glad I got this as a sample.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
3276,"2016-02-24",4.1,"At warped wing. Poured in a snifter. Rich thick creamy mouthfeel. Immediate mild/ dark chocolate with a hint of a coffee finish. (Side by side comparison with regular Pirogue- barrel aged is thicker and creamier and more coffee taste)

3276,"2016-02-13",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 16, 2016 On tap at the MadTree Winter Bonanza. Dark brown, near-black color. Minimal ring of white head. Moderate to bigger btitter taste, light to moderate sweet, some nice alcohol warmth. Dark chocolate, touch of coffee, little bit of belgian-style banana and spice that works well with the rest, and bourbon that adds heat and charred oak character. A bit hot, but tasty stuff overall. I think I prefer the regular Pirogue, more balanced, this has heat. Nice to sip on, though. 8/3/8/4/16 Update, 2/16/16: 16oz can, dated 2/09/16. Black color. An aggressive pour yielded a nice bubbly brown head, leaving plenty bits of lace. Awesome dark chocolate, good touch of coffee. Mild to moderate roast, nice bit of banana again in there, mild spice. Good bourbon barrel heat to it, a bit aggressive, but works nicely with the base beer. Nice mild chewiness to the texture, sort of silky, creamy texture. Kind of bigger body. Feels similar to a good imperial porter. Light, kind of crisp carbonation. Mild slick texture. Moderate to bigger sweet taste, but not cloying nor sugary at all. Light to moderate bitter, and a noticable alcohol warmth on the finish that is actually pretty fun here. Really nice stuff. Probably best to split the can, but I wanted to indulge as I contemplated.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
3276,"2016-02-09",4.0,"Poured cloudy brown color with a large frothy off-white head that lasted with excellent lacing. Complex wood, dark malt and alcohol aroma. Medium to full body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy dark  sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet finish of moderate duration with a small alcohol bite. This is a complex standout beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3276,"2016-01-31",4.1,"Draft, the beer is a darker brown to black with a khaki head of foam. In the aroma I get raisin and toffee. Big booze character as well. I get some cheesecake nuances as well. Big body and medium carbonation. Very good.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
