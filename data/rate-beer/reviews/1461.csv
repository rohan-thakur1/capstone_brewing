A lot of dark chocolate flavors up front. Intensely sweet in the beginning but transitions into a sharp, bold coffee note/espresso for the development. The strong espresso sticks around all the way into the finish but is accompanied by some creamy vanilla and a bit of warming alcohol as well. As it warms up, theres a raw sugary sweetness that comes through, which is also followed by a strong taste of alcohol as you can expect from a brew of this strength. The espresso notes are still there, but the vanilla seems to have disappeared. The mixture of strong coffee & alcohol really makes it tastes like a shot of espresso mixed with a shot of vodka.
M: Very full-bodied with low carbonation; the finish is bone dry; booze warmth throughout. The coffee/espresso is really prominent in this porter!!

I dont know why the differences between the two tastings were so big. The sweet taste that the vanilla added in the 650ml bottle was gone. Now the taste is full of bitter coffe. Dont get me wrong, this beer is still great, but it feels like something is amiss. Did they change the recipe? Another type of coffee maybe? Finish is a bit too bitter.

Otherwise it is still great. Heavy roasted malt base with chocolate, coffee and a hint of vanilla. Long finish. Warming, beautiful Imperial Porter.","Mora, SWEDEN","OminouSC2"

Significantly roastier flavor than aroma, dark-roast coffee and dark chocolate up front, roasty malted barley in the middle with lingering chocolate bitterness and vanilla bean on the finish. Full-bodied and creamy, to all outward appearances the carbonation should be more than sufficient, but the mouthfeel still seems heavy and flat for this type of beer. Would benefit from more carbonation or more vanilla. A nice looking beer and fairly textbook example of a roasty stout.

An excellent imperial porter with a strong alcohol kick & lots of flavour, particularly at the end when a warming alcohol kick came through. Well-balanced with nice coffee & vanilla flavours on top of the dark malts & roasted flavours, it was an outstanding beer & one of the better porters Ive tried so far, although Orkney Porter probably still comes out on top.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

Flavors are delicious, a mix of roasted barley with a good bit of dark fruity sweetness, and a moderately carbonated and bitter finish.

1461,"2016-01-23",4.4,"Excellent brew. Very dark brown almost black coffee color with a nice foam head that is tannish orange. The aroma is strong coffee and rye bread with a subtle hoppy whiff. The initial taste is hoppy coffee with a pleasant bitter bite. As it sits in the mouth it gets smooth with a barely sweet toffee taste mixed with dark malt and hops with vanilla espresso. Its complex with different taste, but they mingle exceptionally well. The aftertaste returns to a more bitter roasted hop essence with a tinge of creamed coffee.

Delightful aroma: mocha, cappuccino, dark chocolate, cured meat, wet leather, dates, wet peppercorns, black olives, gingerbread, indeed vanilla but subtly so, dried grapefruit peel, hint of marmelade, cocoa, kahlua, dry sherry, sharp and stimulating accents of burnt wood, toasted bread, pipe tobacco, cinnamon, candied figs, baked banana sweetness piercing through everywhere. Candied sweet onset, raisins and dates all around, banana, but kept in place with restraining sourish and (especially) umami accents, the latter not becoming too overpowering but just adding a subtle seaweed- or mushroom-like complexity to the whole, tangy and noble, with a soft, gentle carbonation just fit for this style; vanilla sweetness suddenly pops up and accompanies the deep, thick, oily maltiness filling the mouth with well-dosed caramelly, nutty and toasted flavours before plunging into a rich and creamy chocolateness which leaves a bittersweet coating in the back of the mouth and throat, further dried by peppery, spicy, tangy hops; needless to say, a black, roasted coffee bitterness manifests itself in that phase and keeps lingering far beyond, but one can feel it is from pure coffee rather than from thick roasted barley, as would be the case in the average imperial stout. There is a glow of warming alcohol in the end, but only gently so, and for a 10% ABV beer the alcohol remains remarkably well camouflaged. An almost dame blanche-like sensation remained with me for a long time.  I need to get more Ballast Point beers: they are always right on the money. I love imperial porters and frankly, I did not expect this to be anything less than a masterpiece in its style. And they nailed it.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

1461,"2015-05-15",4.0,"12oz bottle into tulip. Minneapolis. 

Pretty nice looking beer. Dark chocolate brown, black basically, dark tan head.

As advertised, aroma is heavy on vanilla and coffee. Roasted barley is heavy. There are some fairly strong fruit notes in the back, which are a little outputting for me. 

Taste is pretty strong, especially for a porter. Sweetness dominates. 

Body is medium-strong. Soft carbonation. Very long finish. 

Overall, this is a well made beer, but wouldnt buy again. The aroma is really nice, but the fruit notes are just too strong. It would be so nice without them. The coffee and vanilla are strong (and great).","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","ChrisSc"

Very nicely balanced sweet strong milky coffee with mild vanilla. Were it not for the carbonation, you might be able to convince somebody in a blind taste test they were drinking iced café au lait. Yes, it really is dominated by the coffee to that extent - and thats not even close to being a criticism.

This is a deep brown beer w/ a long-lasting foamy brown head. The vanilla is used really well in this beer. It is very apparent but not overwhelming and its presence serves to highlight a bunch of minor players typically present in roasty ales that are normally only supporting rolls. It brings out the chocolate from the coffee and roasted grains and also a nice cherry and cinnamon note presumably from the yeast or maybe hops--not that I have any way of knowing. This is a rich and creamy brew w/ a flavor profile which implies sweetness w/o the beer itself being all heavy and sticky. The coffee is really well done too w/ good, solid flavor but no harsh, ashy old day old coffee notes.

1461,"2014-12-17",4.2,"22oz bottle poured into a cervoise. The aroma is initially fresh coffee beans which turn towards a roasted coffee / mocha character. This is followed by briefly by fresh baked chocolate chip cookies with a notable vanilla and caramel characters. The coffee beans come back later as a secondary note to the vanilla and caramel. It pours a dark, opaque blackish color with hints of oily, burnt caramel around the edges, and is topped by a brown-orange frothy head that retains a thick ring and big, poofy island, as well as an abundant, dense lacing. The taste is a medium high sweet and medium high bitterness, nearly balanced, but its definitely a stronger bitter. The slick and thick texture has a creamy carbonation with a touch of prickliness. The full body starts out with smooth syrupy caramel flavored with vanilla. Then some cookie-like sugariness comes through and it finishes with espresso bitterness and a woody, gritty quality. The coffee character lingers, turning more towards coffee grounds, with hints of vanilla coming in and out.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

1461,"2014-11-19",4.7,"Pours dark as a starless night with an excellent massive head. Lacing and retention are also excellent. Nice nose of sweet dark chocolate over coffee with strong vanilla notes. Medium body with a slick texture that has creamy aspects, but is not quite there. Above average carbonation with effervescence present from the middle on. The flavor profile is simply a masterpiece - intense, complex and balanced. It begins with a rush of sweet dark chocolate that highlights the vanilla aspects but also has a distinctive caramel presence. As the sweetness fades, coffee becomes evident and the vanilla becomes more note like and the caramel is most noted. The middle is the only detection of roast I encountered, and it is buttressed by hop flavor (rind like) and bitterness. A combination of alcohol, hops and coffee yield a nice puckering effect. The finish is quite smooth and lingers with an abundance of all the previous flavors. It is the most complex finish Ive had the privilege to experience. The finish is where the 10% alcohol becomes evident as a very slight nice burn at the back of the throat. This one is World Class, the best porter Ive ever had and its rating is second to only FBS.

1461,"2014-10-26",4.1,"22 oz bottle, poured into a snifter at approximately 45 degrees F.

A: Pours a deep, dark brown, verging on black. Once in the glass, no light whatsoever filters through the brew - it almost seems as though light rays that stray too close are sucked in and absorbed. A thick, fluffy dark tan head forms and hangs around for a while, slowly dying down to a cap and ring which leave clumps of lacing on the glass.

S: The aroma opens with dark, dark, dark roasted grain, not unlike burned bread, wreathed through with black coffee-espresso to form a miasma of the color black. Underlying that is a sort of earthen bitterness.

T: Oh, that thick, heavy, blunt, blackened roasted grain! The flavor opens with a veritable club of blackened, burned bread and grain, with traces of smoke and char. Unfiltered dark roast coffee takes not merely center stage, but also left, right, and the orchestral pit at times. There are notes to the flavor quite reminiscent of burnt firewood or campfire ashes, mixed with the scorched earth from the bottom of a firepit dug in the deep woods. Vanilla is hinted at, bringing no sweetness along with it whatsoever, not unlike sipping extract right from the bottle. Alcohol heat comes in during the bitter, slightly astringent finish.

M: Thin, far thinner than one might expect for a brew this heavy, dark, flavorful, and high ABV. It verges on watery at times as it moves across the palate.

O: While Id have preferred a little more malt sweetness to come through the blackened flavorstorm, and a little more body and heft to the feel, this is definitely a tasty example of an imperial porter!","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

1461,"2014-10-05",4.4,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a beautifully deep brown-nearly black color with a huge billowy brown colored head. The head just sits there and persists, very slowly fading over time to leave one fantastic level of streaky lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  Oh man there is a whole lotta coffee in this smell. A huge coffee aroma greets the nose with it being accompanied by tons of vanilla and caramel sweetness. Along with these aromas are some very nice roasted malt smells as well as a moderate presence of a cocoa smell. A little bit of a woody aroma and a decent showing of a boozy smell round out the aroma profile, creating a rather sweet, dark and warming smell overall. Quite delicious smelling.
 Taste  The taste begins with tons of dark roasted malt and a sweeter coffee flavor. The sweeter nature of the brew is of a vanilla and caramel nature with just a hint of chocolate mixed within. The sweeter vanilla and caramel actually pick it up as the taste moves onto the end with the vanilla getting quite strong at the end. All the while the coffee also steps it up getting even stronger in flavor toward the end of the taste, and bringing with it a little bit of a more roasted and some more bitter flavors. While the nose displayed quite a boozy nature the taste did not display as much just giving some hints of alcohol. In the end with the mix of flavors one is left with a sweeter and rather coffee heavy roasted flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the average to slightly thinner side for a 10 % brew with a carbonation level that is on the average side. Overall the feel was rather fitting as it prevented both the boozy flavors and coffee flavors from becoming too overpowering, but while still providing the base for all the complex flavors to be appropriately appreciated.
 Overall  This is a nice coffee lovers imperial porter. Big on coffee with a nice blend of roast, coffee, sweet, and booze. A very nice one to try if you get a chance.","","Darkmagus82"

1461,"2014-01-22",3.3,"Bomber. Nose is full of fresh coffee, chocolate, and strong vanilla, and on the latter point a little medicinal but natural. Pours dark brown with a light brown head. Taste is perhaps strongest on the vanilla, actually somewhat overdone to my taste, with a coffee and vanilla liqueur base, plenty of warmth in the chest, some roast and chocolate with caramel and malty undertones. The coffee seems very more orange-handled diner than gourmet, and the nice prickling from the extended hopping contributes too little to compensate. Light and pleasant acidity, low bitterness, and probably a bit too sweet for me to finish the whole bomber, but the alcohol is well-claimed and the syrupy medium-full body is appropriate for character. Well-executed and clean, but I dont like the recipe or conception.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

Poured into a tulip. Appearance is deep opaque black with a tall tan head that eaves some patches of lace. We debated which aromas/flavors might have faded in aging and were pleasantly surprised immediately after we started. Aroma is coffee-powered with roast malt, some cocoa, and vanilla (which we though may have faded most, but was still holding its own). No astringency or strong booziness to indicate the 10% abv. Taste is off the charts, like a delicately carbonated vanilla frappuccino.

Taste follows the nose with strong coffee flavors upfront followed but a slightly bitter finish.

However, as the beer warmed up, it started to reveal itself. The vanilla became quite prominent and added an enjoyable, sweet counterbalance to the coffee.

A: Pours a dark, brown ale. single finger latte head falls quickly leaving a fine velvet sheet. Little lacing.
S: Plenty of coffee. Sharp alcoholic nose. A little overbearing with the coffee and alcohol. 
T: Once the beer hits the mouth, its all vanilla. Such a severe transition from coffee to vanilla, man I dont really dig this. Okay, a little bit later and the coffee is starting to balance out the vanilla sweetness a bit. Roasty background.
M: Thick with low carbonation. Sticky.
D: This is a big beer. I will finish the bottle, but I will never seek this out again.

1461,"2013-12-04",4.0,"Bomber. 2013 bottling. Nearly black pour, with a creamy tan head; nice lacing. Overt aromas of espresso, with layers of vanilla extract and bakers coco. Once settled, the carbonation gives a soft, creamy, full mouthfeel, with an overall medium weight on the palate. 10% very well concealed. Similar flavors of vanilla cream, coco powder and creamy espresso coat the palate... Kinda like espresso poured over vanilla ice cream, with a drizzle of chocolate. Flavors of dry, bitter coffee and dark chocolate cling to the palate. Well defined, if not a bit one dimensional.. Though still good stuff. Definitely need to be in the mood for a coffee or mocha to fully enjoy. A little more weight and concentration would take this to the next level.. Though I'm not complaining. Solid.

Creamy vanilla, chocolate and coffee whip up a memorable piece of cake.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam sits atop the blackness.
-These super-sweet dessert-like concoctions can only work if theyre impeccable, and this one is.
-Coffee and roasted malts add welcoming depth away from the sweetness spectrum.
-Carbonation was pleasantly fluffy.

Typical appearance of a dark, yummy porter style.
A pleasing, warm alcohol aroma, woody smoke, cinnamon, bittersweet chocolate. I really am not getting any coffee hints, but the vanilla comes through with the alcohol....interesting.
Taste is slightly more hoppy than some other porters, but good.
Definitely some more alcohol on the finish, along with some tootsie roll sweet chocolate flavors.
This was an interesting Imperial Porter....at first, I wasnt to sure about it...just didnt quite seem to be all there, a bit off kilter maybe.
As I sat, enjoyed and rated, it became more enjoyable.
My suspicion is that this needs to be served at a bit warmer temp than some other porters for a full experience.

I really wanted it to be a little more vanilla-forward than it is, but then again thats asking for perfection. Its a fantastic beer as it is, and Im glad it finally got to Texas.

The taste starts out in that same vanilla and coffee indulgent half, and then the booze takes over. This is definitely an imperial that let's you know you're drinking it. The booze is overwhelming on the back end, and that booziness is what hangs around. If they could make the vanilla and coffee linger and cover the booze, this would be a 5, or damn close.

Seems strange to be in Santa Barbara yesterday and then buy Ballast Point today, but what a delight that they are now available in Seattle. A vigorous pour into my duvel tulip yields an inky black topped with a vigorous brown head. Nose of vanilla and cocoa, light touch of ash and chocolate cake, the vinous notes of a porter rather than a stout. Intense, intense flavors: black coffee and vanilla, mocha midrange, the vinousness from the aroma, bitter coffee and very very late a mint tic-tac close. A hint of soy sauce as it warms to room temperature. Alcohol is well hidden -- Id have guessed 8% rather than 10%, full but not thick in body, a bit of warmth late.

Bold flavors but everything gets a fair shake. Mouthfeel is slightly thin when compared to similar beers. This gives founders breakfast stout a run for its money.","South Euclid, Ohio, USA","DoublEE"

1461,"2013-06-26",4.0,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. 

Coffee Vanilla Imperial Porter comes out of the bottle looking dark and brooding. The beer itself pours a dark obsidian color. The head starts as a dark tan foam, bubbling up through the beer and rising up the glass. The foam eventually rises a few inches to reach the top of the glass. A slow recession leaves plenty of lace sticking to the glass.

The aroma provides a blast of roasted malt notes and deep, full coffee. There is a little bit of bitter dark chocolate in the back, but the aroma is mainly a blast of roasted malt and bitter coffee.

My first impression is that this beer is big, bold, and makes no apologies for being so. Dark roasted malt has hints of smoke and dark chocolate. A jolt of vanilla breaks up the bitter transition from fully roasted malt to intense coffee. The coffee starts strong, with the bitterness coming after. With each sip the cumulative bitterness grows, reminding me of just how intense of a beer this is.

Perhaps it is some kind of magic trick, but this beer does not drink like it has 10% alcohol. There is almost no alcohol present in the taste; it is only noticeable in a slight tingle on my tongue and gums. There is a great creamy nature to the carbonation, more so that the beer. If anything, the flaw with this beer is how light the body feels compared to the robustness of the flavor and carbonation. There is a little bit of bitter and sweet sticky residue left on my lips.

This is truly a great beer and may be the best porter I have had so far. The combination of flavors and level of intensity really do it for me.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Pours dense pitch black color with a 1 finger dense dark tan head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers.  Light spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass.  Aromas of big vanilla, cream, milk chocolate, caramel, toffee, coffee, light roasted malt, and dark bread.  Incredible aromas with great balance and complexity of dark malt and sweet vanilla notes.  Taste of milk chocolate, vanilla, cream, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, light char, toast, floral, and light pine.  Lingering notes of vanilla, milk chocolate, cream, roasted malt, caramel, coffee, light char, toast, dark bread, floral, and light pine on the finish for a while.  Fantastic balance and complexity of roasted and sweet creamy vanilla malty flavor; with a good malt/bitterness balance and zero cloying sweetness present after the finish.  Medium carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is great.  Alcohol is very well hidden with only a small warming noticed after the finish.

Not as overwhelming with espresso as the fragrance suggests, the flavors are more extensive. Chocolate covered raisin melts into creme de cassis and dark raspberry liqueur. Bitter baking chocolate provides a good balance to an otherwise decadent draught.

Chewy and mouth-filling, the palate is more akin to taking a bite of German chocolate cake than drinking.","Orange, California, USA","Jonathan_E"

1461,"2013-01-23",3.7,"Type: 22-oz. bomber 
Glass: Oversized wine glass 
From: Holiday Wine Cellar in Escondido, Calif.
Price: $9.99 
Purchased: Dec. 27, 2012
Consumed: Jan. 23, 2013
Misc.: Enjoy by 12/10/13

Poured a black color with two fingers of bubbly tan head. Lots of thick, sporadic, foamy lacing on the sides. Good retention on the top.

Smelled very bitter coffee malts up front. Also strong notes of toffee, caramel and dark chocolate, and a light whiff of vanilla.

Tasted a smoother, milder version of the smell. Got bitter coffee malts, dark chocolate, Oreo cookie, smoky fire, roasty malts and burnt toast. Alcohol is well hidden. Nowhere near as good as the smell.

Full body. Slick-to-thick texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth finish. Got better as it went down. Toffee and caramel really come through, and even got some light vanilla notes late. 

I have to say I was a bit disappointed. I saved this beer for the longest out of any of the others I purchased on Dec. 27. Good, but not great.","","User134089"
1461,"2013-01-22",4.1,"Dark brown in color with rich brown tan head... Aroma of chocolate malts and coffee... Flavor is intensely rich, tons of chocolate notes with a finish of coffee bitterness... Superb beer","California, USA","baraciisch"
1461,"2013-01-22",3.7,"Reviewed 12/31/2012. Thanks to Momar42 for the bottle share! Part of a 22 oz bottle poured into a Hunahpus snifter. Notes from last nights Skins/Cowboys game.

A: Pours a nicely opaque black color. The head is a one finger offwhite color with decent levels of lacing on the glass.

S: Lots of vanilla to start off - and Im impressed by how naturally it comes off, as well. After that comes a moderate coffee profile...and then after that, tons of chocolaty dark (not necessarily roasted) malts. Not the greatest aroma ever, but I really like how it evolves in its layering.

T: The very first sip is a little harsh with vanilla, though it will smooth out after a few more sips. I really enjoy the layering of the flavors; first vanilla, than subtle mocha coffee, and finally a chocolate and licorice finish. Theres a vegetal component in there that I feel harms the balance. Quite good, apart from the overboard vanilla bittersweetness - but some aging will tone it down nicely.

M: The finish is pure sticky, wet sweetness, which fits what this tries to accomplish as a dessert beer. I could do without the slight sugar burn, though. In general, its lighter in texture and more sharply carbonated than a typical imperial stout - but its best feature is how superbly the alcohol is hidden. I didnt get a look at the ABV on the bottle, but I could easily guess it to be 5.5% rather than 10%.

O: I hope it was just palate fatigue from drinking a quartet of sours before hand, because this was a bit of a letdown. Regardless, this a damn solid dessert beer that can become a really great one after the vanilla fades some. This wipes the floor with certain vanilla porters that will remain nameless, at least.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"
1461,"2013-01-21",4.5,"Poured into a snifter out of a 22oz bomber.

Pours pitch black and reminds me of used motor oil. Not much in the way of a head but the wisps of lacing left on the sides of the glass is truly impressive considering the abv.

The aroma is extremely pleasant and soft. Dark roast coffee and some light hints of caramel. The vanilla is there but it is very subtle, much more so than any other vanilla flavored beer I have had before. Dark chocolate is also mixed in. Sort of reminds me of a mocha coffee drink.

The flavor is even more impressive and substantial than the aroma. The vanilla is extremely subtle and well-integrated becoming most apparent immediately after the sip. Dark roast coffee and vanilla quickly followed by a shot of caramel. Bitterness reminiscent of dark chocolate and espresso followed then by more vanilla and moderate sweetness. Mouthfeeel is on the sticky side and there is a little bit of tannic bitterness on the roof of the mouth.

Overall, an extremely well done coffee vanilla porter. For once the vanilla is not overdone and is perfectly integrated. A sipper for sure but perfect for the cold winter months and one to savor over the course of an evening.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

1461,"2013-01-09",4.3,"What a beautiful beer!  Theres something about a beer poured into a short glass.  If not the ""small packages carry big punches"" factor, theres also, simply, how good it looks in the glass.  This is a very dark, almost black beer with a thin, dense cream/light-brown colored head.  The aroma is of roasted malts, with sweet coffee and fresh cocoa, but much more dense and concentrated than what youd expect from your everyday porter or stout.  Where this impresses is in the mouth.  Its not only smooth and silky, but also offers a warm, dessert-like sweetness that Ive never experienced before.  Theres something about it thats a cross between Belgian candi sugar, chocolate, and peppers.  In fact, its very reminiscent of mole sauce.  Theres a smoothness in the body that makes the roasted and chocolate sweetness palatable, but keeps it sharp.  I dont think Ive ever had an imperial porter so smooth and (extremely) tasty with hardly any obviousness of an alcohol presence.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

Mouth-filling flavor delights the palate with roast malt, chocolate, nutty, vanilla, coffee and caramel tones with more than a hint of bitter, woody hops. Each sip seems to be subtly different. Its a little like drinking cold quality coffee that has a kick like an angry mule. Smooth, rich texture has a firm tingle that persists; finish is smoky, hoppy and a little chocolate-sweet.

A: Pours a very dark brown, almost black with a wonderful bubble dark brown head. Leaves some wonderful sheet lace behind with some bubbles trying to to keep the head afloat.

S: Big dark coffee beans. Roasted to the point where its almost slighty burnt and bitter, but in a good way. Some slight dark chocolate notes are present as well.

T: Big coffee right up front. That same REALLY toasted flavor is even more present, but after the initial assault on the taste buds it makes way for some light sweet chocolate and vanilla. Im also picking up a burnt sugar/caramel flavoring as well.

M: Medium to heavy bodied, almost chewy in nature. Leaves a great roasted coffee bean flavor with a mild sweetness on the tongue. Leaves an oily feeling on the palate which is highly enjoyable as it allows the taste to linger LONG after Ive swallowed this black gold.

O: Im becoming more and more a fan of brews with heavy coffee flavorings and this might be one of favorites. Its not as balanced as others Ive had, but its still a wonderfully crafted brew and I would LOVE to try this on draft.

Needed to tone down early amateur rating of 5.0 !!!

Still a solid imperial, lots of coffee and tempered well with roasted notes, drinks way under the ABV.

RR to 4.4.

Poured from a 22oz/650ml bottle into a growler (drank Apr12) , thanks to Bruce for packing this in his case and shifting it 6,000 miles for me!!!

Looks a real treat - pours a rich black with a decent beige/tan head after a straight glass/vigourous pour into a Belgian snifter. Head thins after a minute but retains. Lots of lacing above the beer line.

Served at room temperature.

Great smelling beer - coffee hits you immediately and when you withdraw your nose and savour the full spectrum you get the vanilla breaching through, sweet chocolate and malts.

Everything I want from an Imperial Porter in the taste! Chocolate, coffee, sweet and roasted malts and a decent hunk of vanilla in there. Ive had a few vanilla porters where you just dont get that V hit, but here you have no choice !!! A well balanced beer packing flavours and strength but disguising them all well.

The mouthfeel is perfection for a beer of this ilk. Full bodied with a little carbonation, every mouthful makes you return.

One of the best beers Ive had and in my favourite style - the all 5 rating is a real one off but for me this is how it should be as it is right up there for me!!!","Hazlemere, the lower Xhitlerns, Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Theydon_Bois"
1461,"2012-08-02",4.0,"This bottle was a gift from drabmuh. Thanks Matt!

A: A flawless appearance. The beer is jet black and completely opaque. There is a dense, thick, foamy head of a dark tan color. The head retention is great and the glass is coated in lacing.

S: Fresh coffee beans. I am a coffee drinker, and I appreciate the aroma of fresh coffee. We are off to a great start with this beer. Also noted are scents of roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, and alcohol.

T: The beer tastes great. The coffee is more present than the vanilla. The beer leads off with coffee and segues to vanilla and chocolate intertwined in roasted malt. Very impressive. As good as it is, I wish Ballast Point would use authentic vanilla instead of natural flavors. This beer is so close to being amazing. Its the little things that often make the biggest difference.

M: The beer is very flavorful and smooth. The 10% alcohol is disguised very well. Its creamy and thick, with the perfect carbonation level.

D: Its so good, Im drinking it too fast, but not as fast as last time (see notes). This stuff can catch up to you quickly. I thoroughly enjoy this beer. Im taking down the bomber by myself tonight, as I have been really looking forward to a good night to enjoy it, but honestly, its probably best shared a few ways.

Note: Chugging this beer midway through an epic tasting can lead to immediate and irreversible intoxication (even if your friend grills you chicken in the middle of the night) and palate wrecking, causing the imbiber to not be able to differentiate Kate the Great from Alpha Kong. Seriously.

Opening one of two bottles on a quiet evening I found myself faced with a solid imperial porter. The next one may not last long as I continue to whittle down the cellar to a more manageable size. If Ballast Point were available locally I might purchase some other releases from time to time.

Aroma / Appearance - The inky black base slinks into the glass along with a soft cocoa head. Hops, sweet cocoa powder, coffee, and a generous cup of genuine hot chocolate simmer below the surface. Topping it all is a generous dollop of whipped cream.

Flavor / Palate - Subdued hops are probably a result of waiting a few months to open this. The cocoa and black coffee emerge over time. A dash of malt highlights the smooth dry finish. This is a well rounded and robust release that deserves the respect it seems to be getting.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1461,"2012-03-05",4.6,"A lot of beer nerds, myself included, hate how imperial beers tend to be the highest rated brews across the board. Well, the fact is beers can do so much more with more energy and Ballast Point Victory at Sea is proof positive of that. A regular porter tends to be a very direct, mild beer - but what happens when you crank up the voltage? You get a very flavor, complex, robust beer thats really a fun and interesting drinking experience.

I received a 22oz bottle from a friend in San Diego (thanks, Ryan!). I split it with a friend. We each poured it into tulip glasses.

Appearance: Pitch black body with no other colors showing at all. Forms a fairly large, dark khaki creamy/foamy head which retains and laces very well for such a big beer.

Smell: Huge vanilla, chocolate, and coffee notes. Very sweet aroma to be sure, buy with traditional porter notes at the base.

Taste: I love it when beers not only taste great but keep changing up their palate throughout the drinking process. Ballast Point Victory at Sea starts out with a prominent, slightly dry bitterness. Then it turns on a dime into a melange of sweet, syrupy flavors. Iced coffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon and dark chocolate all show up in various stages of the second half. The beer finishes with a strong coffee and slightly roasted malt finale. Its a perfect balance of confectionary sweetness and coffee and hop bitterness. 

As I drink on the palate continues to evolve. Coffee actually takes a back seat to the vanilla and woody flavors. Its not too far removed from rum. These flavors eventually are then superseded by a strong dark chocolate sweetness with slight coffee bitterness. Its all very delectable, especially as a liquid dessert (which is how we drank it). 

Drinkability: Since Ballast Point Victory at Sea is a porter its not surprising it has a smooth, velvety texture and a body thats not quite as sticky and syrupy as its 10% ABV composure might have you believe.  There is no alcohol presence in this brew at all, not even a gentle warmth (although it might explain the rum and woody bourbon cask-like flavors). The only problem? It actually finishes a little too clean! No residual drying effect despite the prominent coffee and dark chocolate bitterness. Thats a flaw I can easily tolerate, though.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
1461,"2012-03-04",3.8,"Pours a deep dark bown, nearly black, but thinner than it would seem it should be.  There is a small amount of dark tan head that sticks around throughout the drink.

Really tasty stuff.","Bloomfield, New Jersey, USA","dogfishho"

1461,"2012-01-01",4.0,"A porter stronger than most. The flavor really comes out as it gets closer to room temperature. I know this is obvious due to the high abv but the flavor change is even more dramatic than with other strong porters. This beer is smooth considering its high gravity origins. The coffee and vanilla bean add to the flavor. They add to the smoothness and a little complexity. However being a high priced beer it must pass a little extra scrutiny to justify the extra dollars. Well if all that extra cash was for the vanilla and coffee Ild say leave it out. Its good and while the taste is complex it seems to be missing something.","","rangerbeer"

So.

Poured into a NoVA Beerfest tasting glass, because I can.

The smell comes out of the bottle as vanilla and coffee. From the glass, vanilla and cocoa. This is a recipe for a beer that panders to me.

Appearance: Dark with very little head, which was slightly off-white. Dark means mostly opaque by the way.

Taste: Oh dang. Vanilla, some coffee, but whats also apparent is the hops bitterness, which I wasnt expecting. Huh. A slight roastiness comes through, which fades into an absolutely amazing cocoa/vanilla dream.
As for the palate, I actually took another sip of this one just so I could feel it again. Its smooth, medium/light carbonation, and a roast cocoa taste that just lingers forever.

Overall, I have to say this is probably the 2nd best beer Ive had in the last 4 or so months. Wonderful!","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

Vanilla is distinct, but in the background; also some light tinges of alcohol.  It also has some caramelly and brown sugar aromas with a touch of espresso and burnt character.  Very smooth and creamy mouthfeel and flavor up front, which leads to a dry and roasted, almost burnt flavor at the finish and aftertaste, but it is restrained from being overly acrid.  Toasted and roasted flavor with caramel and vanilla mid palate.  Very clean fermentatoin for the most part.  A touch of dark fruit character from a bit of age, not from the fermentation process.  The finish is dry from the combination of perceived bitterness and dark malt character.  The mouthfeel starts out smooth and creamy, but finishes on the dry side from malts and alcohol, which is very well hidden.  Fuller medium body; lower medium level of carbonation.

1461,"2011-02-23",3.5,"Obviously an extremely good beer but not to my taste - the vanilla charicter seemed a little overwhelming which made it seem slightly artifical and the chocolate was too sweet for the beer to be ballanced.","Havelock North, NEW ZEALAND","grapengrain"
1461,"2011-02-19",4.2,"Poured into a pint glass. Big thanks to Khazadum for this. 

4.0 A: Pours a black color. Two fingers of light brown creamy/frothy hybrid head. Average retention and some lacing. Good enough.

4.5 S: Not surprisingly the strongest aromas are coffee and vanilla. Sweetness gives the illusion of coffee with cream. Plenty of toastiness, with some roastiness as well, some grainy malts, semisweet chocolate, and caramel. Very nice.

4.5 T: Tastes a lot like the nose which is a cup of strong coffee with vanilla cream. The bitterness seems to come from mostly the coffee and its moderate strength at best. Again, roasty and toasty, grainy, caramel and toffee, and quite tasty. Booze is hidden well.

4.5 M: Heavier medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Super creamy and smooth. Nearly perfect. 

5.0 D: This one drinks well from start to finish. Flavor is great as is the mouthfeel and this doenst seem like its 10%. Good beer overall and easily the best Ive had from BP. Sculpin doesnt even come close.

1461,"2011-02-03",4.3,"Poured stout black into my tulip glass with a dark khaki head with a thin lacing.   The smell is amazing, up front loads of coffee, chocolate roasted malts, and a subtle vanilla.   Cant stop inhaling it to the point some almost went up my nose.  Id like to chop it up and take one Steve-o style but my better judgement got the best of me this time.  Its a sneaky beer in my eyes it tastes exactly how it smells and in that order.  Its a silky smooth texture with great after taste with a slight hint of alcohol (but barely).   Definitely not sludge like a stout but delightful feel for a porter.  This is an awesome beer and only wish they would they would release one with real vanilla bean and not just flavoring and set it in bourbon barrels for a few months.  Then it would be the perfect imperial porter in my eyes.

1461,"2010-12-29",3.2,"In short: An over-the-top vanilla and cacao lovefest.  Good but a bit too much
How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed when about 1 year of old.  Sent to me by nbutler11.  Thanks a lot Nick.
The look: Near black body topped by a small tan head
In long: Intense nose of cacao, vanilla and burnt malts.  That nose is really intense.  Taste is even more intense, too much so.  A ton of vanilla, a lot of cacao, caramel, roastiness, marshmallows, a cup black coffee, dark liquorice, booze.  Alcohol is rather apparent.  For the first half of my bottle I thought this beer was very good.  But during the second half of the bottle the vanilla and marshmallows were getting a bit too much for me.  Cloyingly sweet too.  I am no wimp and I can (and do) drink bombers of big imperial stouts on a regular basis.  Dark Lord at 15%?  Bring it on baby.  But the Victory At Sea is a beer that can only be enjoyed in small quantities.  And because of that my score is not very high.

1461,"2010-12-07",3.5,"22oz bottle, purchased at Papago Brewing. Pours a deep, cola-brown color with a reddish tinge; slight, fine-bubbled, light-tan head with decent lacing and retention. Solid, chocolatey and dark roasted malts in the aroma; light notes of ash and bitter chocolate; some modest red fruit notes; basic, but solid and enjoyable imperial stout aroma. Medium-full body; modest carbonation; minimal alcohol showing through, well-integrated as a vinous component; lots of darker chocolate and roasted malts, cola and some modest touches of caramel and hints of a burnt malt character; overall, not a particularly effusive imperial stout (nothing compared to something like 50/50 Totality or even Rasputin), but still pretty enjoyable and neither acrid nor overly burnt. Maybe a touch too much roasted bitterness for the amount of flavor, and there is a bit of warming alcohol as this warms. Lasting finish of burnt and roasted malts, milk and dark chocolate; lingering roasted / bitter ending to this.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

1461,"2010-11-11",3.8,"Picked up a bomber bottle at Spirits of St. Germain in La Jolla, California, and tasted it from a snifter.  It pours a very dark and murky brown.  Head is tan, and fairly thin and short-lived for me.  Smells and tastes like a coffee shop, and I mean that in a good way.  The sweet, roasted coffee aroma is huge...coffee dominates the taste at first as well, but is soon complemented by the vanilla and chocolate flavors, and a nice maltiness.  Theres also a raisin-like dark fruit flavor that enters to accompany the lingering, mild bitterness of the finish.  Its medium-bodied, and fairly lightly carbonated--this gives it a somewhat velvety feel, but I wonder if my particular bottle might be slightly less carbonated that its supposed to be (this might explain the thinness of the head as well).  Regardless, Victory at Sea is very good overall; especially good after a light meal or when the weather starts to turn colder.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","StormCoat"
1461,"2010-11-04",4.4,"Found at Albertsons in San Diego.  Roasted coffee and chocolate waft off this black beer with a dense, tan, persistent head.  Rich milk and dark chocolate creaminess hit you on the first sip followed by light vanilla flavor and sweetness, and then a deep roasted/charred malt flavor.  Beautiful, well balanced bitterness follows up, probably both from hops and from the dark roasted malt.   Even through this heaviness, theres a fresh grain husk flavor that comes through and makes what could be an over the top dark beer surprisingly refreshing.   It says 10% ABV, but it sure doesnt show it and goes down smooth as silk.  Comparable to Old Rasputin with a coffee/vanilla flavor thrown in.

Appearance: Pours black with a minimal khaki crown that shows little retention or lace.

Smell: Wow this is one lovely smelling brew! Loads of coffee and vanilla over a nicely roasted malt. Some chocolate makes an appearance but its more of a supporting role.

Taste: Very good blend of coffee, vanilla, roasted malt, and chocolate. So close to a 5.0

Black with a pale beige head. Small lacings.

The aroma is quite intense with notes of vanilla and coffee, and surprisingly much malty fudge. 

The flavor cranks it up a notch. Its full-bodied and nicely carbonated, and up front there is lots of smooth sweet vanilla and fudge. Then, dry coffee and roasted malts kick in along with some chocolate, leading the way to a bitter finish of roasted malts, coffee and vanilla. An eventful flavor profile and quite full of character, but to much sweet vanilla for me. Almost reminds me of overly sweet liqueurs associated with ladies way older than me.","Malme, SWEDEN","ricke"

M: A rather full body and smooth mouthfeel. The carbonation is low to moderate, which helps out the aforementioned feel on the tongue.

T-The initial flavor is subtle and offers a subtle vanilla sweetness with a touch of dark malt backbone. The finish is full of vanilla sweetness with some coffee undertones-but then just as the sweetness almost becomes too much a moderate roasted malt bitterness comes through to balance all the flavors. The slightest alcohol heat can be detected as well.

The beer pours black with a medium tan head. There is nice carbonation as it rises about 3 fingers of creamy head. It lasts a couple minutes and has great lacing that sticks from the top of the glass to the beer.

The aroma is medium, mostly roasted coffee, but not overpowering. In the middle you get the glimpse of vanilla, lake a cappucino. Wish it was a little more dominant. 

The taste is good, but way to overpowered with coffee from start to finish with a bitter roast finish. I want the vanilla to come out to play more, along with some other complexity please?

Not inky though with some mahogany around the edges, which I guess is an argument for it being a porter (whatever that means).   The aroma is great, with lots of coffee and maybe even more vanilla; almost like a mocha with a shot of vanilla syrup.   Im having Starbucks flashbacks, and I like it.   Plenty of milk chocolate as well, and the vanilla aids in the impression of an immense sweetness.   Did I already mention the vanilla?   I got more coffee at first, but the vanilla is really coming out over time.   Forty-five minutes in the glass, and this begins to resemble vanilla extract.   I love that stuff.   The flavor is sweet, but not thick or sticky (wait, thats a mouthfeel).   Coffee, poser dark chocolate, and lots of vanilla.   Fresh coffee, which is always a nice touch.   Just enough bitterness to balance the sweet, and no astringency or discomfort.   Medium-full body with carbonation that falls somewhere between medium and low.   Just a hint of alcohol warmth in the finish, but very integrated and smooth for a ten percent beer.   Leans more heavily on the coffee, and especially the vanilla, than I was expecting, but this is fantastic stuff.   A true dessert drink,  (or morning depending on how you roll, and I do have a slight caffein buzz) but one that is not overly sweet or thick.   I could drink a fair bit of this, with alcohol being a welcome limiting factor before any abrasive flavor characteristics.   Ballast Point just nailed in on this one: full of flavor, yet balanced and super drinkable.   The vanilla is almost silly at times, but I love the stuff and it really works with the rest of the beer.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Sweet chocolate malty aroma with a very nice roasty character and subtle vanilla. These combined aroma produce a tootsie roll like chocolate coffee scent that is mouthwatering. The roasted coffee bean presence becomes more prominent when it warms. Subtle hops become evident beneath the lactic, silky chocolate notes. Very complex aroma, hopefully the flavor lives up to it.

Chewy silky malt dominated full body with a huge roasted coffee bean presence. Lots of silky chocolate malt and some subtle mellow vanilla notes but the flavor is a bit overpowered by the very intensely strong deep roasted coffee, espresso bean. Hints of oatmeal, toffee, very burnt toast and licorice with a nice dry bitter hop character in the finish. I cant overemphasize how much of a strong burnt/roasted coffee presence there is. Its a bit too harsh for me and extremely bitter, taking away from the silky chocolate and vanilla notes that I liked so much. Alcohol heat mid-palate that becomes stronger at the end of the swallow and produces some warmth in the finish. Pretty complex but a bit one dimensional for me.

1461,"2009-07-25",3.7,"7/23/2009:  Ballast Point Victory at Sea Coffee Vanilla Imperial Porter has semi-sweet chocolate, hints of espresso, and plenty of vanilla in its aroma.  Its appearance is near black in tolor with a tan-colored head that deposits ring-like lacing on the glass.  The flavor consists of dark malts, hints of chocolate, strong acidic coffee, and loads of vanilla bean.  Mocha comes through in the finish.  To be honest, the vanilla is a bit overpowering as it is not balanced by any of the other flavors.  To make matters worse, this medium-bodied beer feels a bit thin.  Is this a good beer?  Yes, but I dont think its anywhere near being great for me.  I didnt like it nearly as much as the majority of the recent ratings or as much as those who sampled it with me...

Taste: Dark, roasted malt flavor with a double shot of espresso, chocolate, and reasonably strong, smooth accents of vanilla beans. Subtly sweet.

Pours viscous dark brown with a small but resilient brown head.  Aroma is of very sweet dark chocolate, cocoa powder, and coffee.  Similar, but less sweet to Southern Tiers Mokah.  Upon sipping, one is greeted with a chewy, full-bodied mouthfeel, prickled slightly by carbonation.  This beer also leans primarily chocolate-sweet, especially inially.  The mid-palate brings in toasted coffee to the mix.  The finish is full, yet with an interesting dryness.  Some mildly coffee-bitter notes emerge as well, but not enough to override the sweetness of this brew.  Interesting, very flavorful, and ultimately successful.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"

Cacao, dried fig, tobacco and lots of smoke...taste reminded me a little bit of Back Flag (another pirate/ship oriented moniker).

The nose is a great mix of dark-roast coffee, roast, chocolate malt, a little alcohol, and just a little vanilla.  The flavor is much heavier on the vanilla than the aroma would suggest.  A little too heavy even, it makes me think Im taking a shot of vanilla extract.  The coffee and roast are still there in force, but the vanilla is just really overbearing.  Finishes with a bit of astringency and a shot of alcohol warmth.  Medium to full bodied with a nice creamy texture and soft gentle carbonation.  Overall, this just missed the mark for my tastes.

The flavors are sweet and decked with a rich roasted malt and coffee profile. There are also is a notice of vanilla lurking in the background of all the richness of the malts as well as hint of chocolate syrup.

1461,"2009-05-16",3.7,"Sampled April 2009
A vigorous pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a dense, creamy, darkly browned crown of froth that rises three fingers in height.  The head leaves copious amounts of dense lace on the sides of my glass as it slowly subsides.  The beer is almost pure black in color, but does have a touch of brown to it.  When held up to the light the beer shows just a touch of an amber hue to it around the edges, but I wouldnt really say that it is passing any light through.  The aroma has the coffee leading off along with roasted malt notes, but it has a soft backdrop of vanilla that becomes more noticeable the longer I spend smelling the aroma (though it never goes beyond subtle).  The vanilla accentuates a solid dark chocolate aromatic note here and it also helps to soften the sharp, roasted grain and coffee notes.  The nose  has quite a rich, satisfying, even satiating quality to it.

As the beer hits my tongue I notice that it has a rich, satisfying heft to it, though it is not quite as heavy as the nose might have suggested; it is still a sipping beer though.  Vanilla flavors accentuate a malt sweetness as well as a dark chocolate flavor.  Bitter, roasted coffee flavors are found in the finish and can get a touch acrid at times.  The bitterness from the dark malt and coffee flavors really lingers on in the finish.

This beer has a nice balance to it, between the vanilla notes and sweetness up front and the roasted, biting notes towards the finish, but it can seem a little simplistic at times.  The vanilla really helps this beer shine; the roast malt and coffee notes would be too aggressive, too acrid and too bitter without the vanilla.  This is definitely a nice after dinner sipping brew and I find that I am quite enjoying it.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The palate is just medium heavy. The ashy, burned coffee flavor is great, but why is there so much vanilla? Its a very sweet, vanilla/sugar powder note and it is so sticky it subtracts from the beer. It gets pretty overwhelming after a bomber for sure.

1461,"2009-04-18",4.0,"Pours a black espresso with chestnut tinges around the edges.  Light tan head is a little on the short side with large, loose bubbles.  Coffee nose is ultra-prevalent on this one.  Its almost a one-sided affair until your nose down in it.  Fresh ground espresso, bitter sweet chocolate, a nice clean roastiness, smoke and a hint of sweetness.  Enticing.  I dont detect much in the way of obvious vanilla, but the  overall aroma is explosive.  Flavor is not complex but is very bold.   The dark roasty coffee notes are hot on this one and again take the forefront.  Semi-sweet chocolate, scorched caramel, toasted walnuts, and smoke all jump out in the middle of the palate.  The finish is bitter initially but quickly checked by a backlash of sugars.  Vanilla is definitely subtle but leaves its presence on the finish.  I feel its not so much of a flavor component as it is used to  amplify  the sweetness of the residual sugars and balance out the bitterness.  Wonderful medium-densie body.

Flavor is much the same, but the coffee shows through even more - kept light on the palate by the vanilla.

Turns out Jesse is the roaster at Caffe Calabria (only a half block from Toronado - gotta love North Park) which provided the coffee for this beer.  He explained the details of how Ballast brewed with the coffee he provided.  Anyway, I liked the beer so much that I had to get a growler fill at the Scripps Ranch location.  

Pours an almost pitch black with 3/4 inch of tan-colored head.  Nose is more cocoa powder than coffee.  The taste starts with chocolate then moves into the coffee -- a nice roasted coffee flavor that is balanced well, not too strong.  Slightly bitter in the finish.  This is a very big beer at 12% but the alcohol is hidden well.

Though the oak/bourbon nuances add more power to the aroma, it still comes off as smooth and rather soothing for its strength.  Maybe a touch too much on the coffee, but it is a coffee imperial porter, afterall.  Alcohol is only glimpsed briefly, after warming.Buttertoffee and strong vanilla immediately give way to a cocoa dryness, ripe with bitter coffee notes, and chocolate covered prunes/raisins.  Some said smoke was apparent, but I seemed to get more of a salty roast-like quality, with black malt bitterness and moderate oakiness.  Very soft texture, overall, however, with low carbonation.  Big pale malt backbone goes the distance and makes for a supple palate without becoming cloying.  Coffee seems, again, a bit too strong and dry, but not glaringly so, I guess.  Alcohol well-concealed with no flaws.  A nutty character either coming from the yeast or neutral tannins, adds a bit of chewiness to the texture.  Glad to have one of their beers on draught, as I was less than impressed with their bottles.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

1461,"2007-02-14",4.3,"Wow...this is one big, wild, quite sweet, espresso coffee Imperial Porter.  Yabba dabba doo!!  Drinking it fresh on tap now at OBriens in San Diego.  Im not a huge chocolate fan, but Im wanting a chocolate or vanilla dessert with this...anything chocolate...ice cream, cake, mousse, maybe something coconut or mango...maybe some water!!  Wow...this is a big and distinct monster of an Imperial Porter.  Would be fascinating to try it aged 6 or 18 months.  Black color, small head, aroma of a sweet espresso.  Im gonna be flying soon...gotta go!!","LA, California, USA","DenverLogan"
1461,"2007-02-11",4.7,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2007 Holy Java!  I can taste the coffee in my colon!  Its like a coffee enema.  Its like Starbucks and Anna Nicole Smith rolled into one.  Coffee aroma and flavor was off the hook.  When it came to the flavor it was chocolate too.  This Black beer didnt have much head after being drawn from OBriens but I didnt hold that against it.    What a great beer.  Wonderful.  Is this considered Baltic Porter or does Porter cover it....
Anyway, what a great beer!  Did I already say that?  Huh must be the 12%... I asked the server for cream and sugar and a cardboard sleeve.  I guess I will be here instead of Starbucks tomorrow morning.  What a great   Beer.","Santee/San Diego, California, USA","fordest"
1461,"2007-02-07",4.5,"On tap and growler from the brewery.  Totally HUGE porter with volumes of Caffe Calabria coffee to eloquently mask the 12% alcohol offering.  Drinks almost like an iced coffee but with the exact opposite effect, if taken in large doses, as I tend to.  The perfect marriage of coffee and ale.  Dark, inviting, delicious. This ale should, obviously, go into steady rotation. Limited supply, so hurry up!","La Mesa, California, USA","Bartzilla"
