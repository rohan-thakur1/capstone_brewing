361,"2017-06-10",3.8,"375ml bottle from Cornelius. 2015 vintage. Pours clear golden orange, almost still, but with a thin ring of white head. Cider-sharp aromas, bread crusts and pear. Slight funk and sweat. Taste is light sour, light orange, faint acetic, rough pear cider vibe again. Lactic acid too. Complex sweet and sour tastes... not clashing exactly, but neither are they in perfect harmony. Still, an interesting beer.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","allmyvinyl"
361,"2017-05-13",4.3,"The luierik or doesjel version of 3Fs Golden Blend, meaning a Golden Blend in which the spontaneous refermentation in the bottle moves forward too late and too slowly, resulting in an undercarbonated geuze and therefore not fulfilling the local consumers expectations of a traditional geuze (traditionally speaking, that is). Never noticed this one existed, honestly, must have confused it with the regular Doesjel, so I ordered it at 3Fs Lambik-O-Droom today, where it was obviously served as properly, carefully and professionally as one can imagine. Loose, bubbly head, requiring forcing to develop but settling into an irregular, snow white rim, eventually retaining quite well but not to the same degree as a succeeded geuze; hazy peach blonde robe with deep and warm orange hue. Aroma has a striking and unexpected, but very inviting tendency of freshly baked bread, refreshened by soft but very outspoken lemon rind, unripe yellow plum, raw rhubarb, dry sherry, wet wood, bread crumbs returning, vaguer hints of stale sweat, kimchi, wet wood, dusty old horse stable. Estery onset but seemingly a tad cleaner than the full-fledged version, lots of unripe stonefruit, unripe gooseberries, wry grape peel, hard pear and a touch of bitter oranges, evidently softly carbonated but not entirely flat like a straight lambic, feeling a bit vinous; bready basis but less so than expected based on the nose, wheaty breadiness too, supporting a long-stretched, drying lactic tartness and a thin but incentive lemony acidity, helping in thoroughly drying the palate. The estery fruitiness seems to become more explicit towards the finish with even a nectarine-like accent in the end, surrounded by Bretty funkiness (though again subduedly so), a lot of wet wood tannins and sherry-ish impressions. I know that the producers consider this type of undercarbonated and under-refermented geuzes a technical failure (and they are right), but this one is still in its very nature an intelligent and delicate blend of great lambics - granted that it hasnt reached the astonishing complexity of the eventual Golden Blend (which is physically the exact same beer), but it still boasts an impressive degree of complexity and personality and I for one thoroughly enjoyed it, especially considering its natural habitat in which I tasted it, of course.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

361,"2016-08-31",4.4,"2012 375mL bottle drunk 8/25/16.Large white head shows good carbonation atop a clear, bright flaxen-gold body.Soft oak tones intertwine deftly with plentiful brett fruitiness, as easygoing lactic notes enter the mix as well. Graceful aging, hints of honey-like malt and cream-of-wheat character deepen the elegance as well as providing a good backbone. Beautifully balanced, attractive nose eminently invites sniffing, with the brett expression just about as perfect as one can imagine, full of horse blanket, guava, lime, light band aid and leather. Bright and clean with no alcohol or flaw.Fantastic in the mouth, as expected, as well. Tight carbonation belies the name, as big bursts of juicy fruit and lip-smakcing sourness coat the palate. Great texture, with a nearly chewy, wheat-laden body that shows good dryness and yet still ample maltiness. Leather, lime, guava and other various tropical fruits linger long, with mild to moderate lactic character and soft, woody, oak tannins. Amazing stuff, and very, very different than the 2011 Golden Blend (non doesjel version).

361,"2016-08-17",3.9,"375 mL bottle. Bottle dated 4/13/2012. Originally reviewed 5/12/2013.

Deep orange. The faintest well up of bubbles at the end. Very thin collar, but no head.

Aroma is trademark Drie Fonteinen sharp oak, white pepper, and some funk. Very malty smelling, too. Doesnt smell that acidic. Still kinda lemony with lots of white wine notes.

Dynamic flavor. Starts off with a bright lemony tartness. Then some sweetness, like a light caramel. Builds into a sharp oak flavor which peaks before leaving off with a grassy herbal character and a hay grain flavor.

Nearly flat. Just a slight hint of carbonation. Not all that sour by gueuze standards.

Upwelling fruits in the beginning, with a very smooth mouthfeel, backed up by musty yeast. Then, sour tartness brings a new layer to the beer, without rolling over the established smoothness. Due to the lack of carbonation in this one, it becomes a little heavier on the palate, and therefore does not get distracted by metallic carbonation. This leaves the attention on the acidic sourness, mingled with grainy malt and oaken notes, which lingers on the palate in a gentle, fruity way for a long time. Also a slight sweetness is recognizable, in a soft, wine-like fashion, which gets washed away, as the lemon zest orientated aftertaste begins to dry out the palate. The sourness nontheless is pleasant on the tongue and well balanced throughout, as it leaven space for impressive sour and bitter notes.","GERMANY","aleigator"

The third beer of the flight transitioned from southern Europe back to the home of the lambic. A reminder of why 3 Fonteinen remains one of the masters of the style, this world class experience tickles the palate and makes you wish that you could somehow get more after the final drop is poured.

Aroma / Appearance - A transparent body the color of rose gold sparkles and shimmers with no carbonation to speak of. Lemons dipped in a blue cheese sauce smell like some sort of funky champagne gone wrong. Musty chocolate bars left in an abandoned library complete the experience.

Flavor / Palate - Tart blue cheese, lemon wedges, and dusty fruit keep the palate alert sip after sip. A flat uncarbonated texture winds its way to a clean finish of flat Sprite, almonds, cheese, and horse blanket. Everything works together to prevent any one aspect getting out of hand. Whether you drink it now or save it for a special occasion the experience should be top notch.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

A very good still gueuze. (Doesjel"" means sleepy - as in, it hasnt been awoken by carbonation, geddit?) Because of the lack of carbonation, it comes across very similar to an unblended lambic, but this is in fact a blend of one, two, three, and four year-old lambics. (Really more like a tart uncarbonated white wine than most beers one could name.) The absence of carbonation means you can sip this for a long time, appreciating the changes in flavour as it warms and opens up. A lot of fun, and definitely worth trying for a sour aficionado, but not as good as the carbonated versions - I find the carbonation adds some texture and even some flavour, really livening it up and bringing it to the next level.

361,"2014-08-19",3.9,"2012 bottle (375ml). Flat orange, zero head, lightest carb. Peach, citrus, light grapefruit and decent funk on the nose; good peppery spice note in there, fairly musty. Taste gives good lemon rind and fairly acidic citrus juice, peaches in there sweetening it up. Waxy lemon comes in along with the funk; medium sourness - not a tongue stripper, citric acidity and funk laid on in a subtle way. Musty spice and peach linger alongside the lemony funk.

361,"2014-08-09",4.0,"Sampled April 2014
A steady pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a faint ring of a head that is a pale, off-white colored head. The aroma is musty, woody, and quite funky with an off fermented fruit like character, and a musky dank foot like character; really this smells like the rind of a funky, earthy, wildly fermented cheese. This is one of the more funky Lambics that I have had, not to mention the fact that this is from 3 Fonteinen. Up front there is a sharpness that is a mix of lactic acid, cat urine, sharp hay like notes, and an oak like spiciness.

My first sip is lightly carbonated, with a nice lactic tartness to it, but is not nearly as sour as I might have expected. The finish has a lingering grapefruit like character to it, as well as a sharp, grassy, cat urine leaning, nicely biting, slightly astringent, perhaps woody character. Musty, sort of mushroom leaning, earthy woody notes, as well as dank in an earthy, damp, cellar like manner. The body is nice and light, and makes this entirely too quaffable, but it still has some viscosity to it such that it is not overly thin; the lactic acid definitely helps with this, as does the oak astringency. The oak character provides a light spiciness here that takes on a bit of clean, white pepper like character.

As with most Lambics, a 375ml bottle of this is not nearly sufficient; this is quite tasty, and I really like how funky this is, quite a bit more so than the usual 3 Fonteinen, though the aroma is more funky than the flavor.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

361,"2014-05-07",3.9,"Bought this one in Cali on my cross country road trip, felt like the right time to give it a go.


A - Pours clear golden yellow with a small film of white head, quickly dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving no lace on the sides of the glass. It was dead flat almost instantly.


S - Smells of woody oak barrel, earthen minerals, light lactic sourness, bit of tart fruit zest and the typical fonteinen barnyard funk. Smells pretty similar to the base beer.


T - Starts off with the strong oak barrel character and minerals quickly being joined by the fruit, sourness and fonteinen funk. Finish is woody with some mild funk, not lingering for very long after the finish. Tastes just like regular Doesjel with some extra barrel tossed in on top.


M - Medium body with low carbonation. Smooth, woody feel with very little sourness. This one is a bit all over the place. I like the flavor but the carb does it no favors.


O - Nothing overly amazing at the moment but it has potential for the future. The wood is pretty strong right now but it should round out with some time. I will have to get a few more of these and stash them away.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

361,"2013-12-21",4.7,"#3100 beer. # 60 Geuze. #25 3 Fonteinen beer. Sampled @ the brewery shop, courtesy of Armand himself. Thx! 375 ml. bottle @ home. Picked up from the same shop. Corked & caged as usual with the top of the bottle covered with foil much like bottles of Cava. The foil is black silver as far as colours go. Bottled on 13/04/2012 this bottle has already been around for some 20 months, a sufficient age for consumption to begin I would say. It pours a candy sugar orange, a shade darker than you would expect. Hazier as well than you would expect, I am the one to blame for that. As I was told at the shop you are advised to let this one rest upright for 3 days prior to drinking in order for all residues to sufficiently settle down. If you are a good boy unlike me and you follow this advice you should obtain a much clearer beer than I did. Once poured into my 3 Fonteinen ""wine"" glass a small and white head does form but only for a brief second as it quickly collapses to a tiny island in the middle of your glass. Some minor lacing does remain afterwards for some time like its ghost coming back to haunt you. Nose is all soft and musty like damned earth in a mushroom cave. Sourdough bread and a freshly opened pack of champignons, though not the mushrooms themselves so much as the earth that is stuck to them. Hay and white pepper. Mellow and round as well something ancient to it, society minus humans style. Taste is mellow mandarin juice mixed with candy sugar, this slides down just like water. So incredibly juicy and fruity and the finish carries old rotting wooden door in the middle of the forest type of bitterness. Pungent pepper and faint hay go hand in hand plus a dash of the good old champignon cave earth. Flat and easier to drink than water. Some minor carbonation is present right after opening, luckily it vanishes quickly all the same. I have had some variable experiences with 3F Doesjels with some of them underperforming and others blowing me away. This one is no different, the one I had at the store was nice but felt a bit like ancient lambic that has lost some of its prowess and didnt feel like worthy of continues nocturnal visitations. The bottle that I got at home was stellar so what give here? Is all of this just a lottery and you have to just hope that you win the jackpot? Or did the fact that I drank mine at home with the sediment poured in (once again, against advice, sorry) & the fact that I drank mine quite cold, much colder than most would dare I am willing to bet? This could be, the striking contrast in flavours felt more than a bit too much to suggest those being the reasons. The one I had at home drank like water or tea in my case or mater (). I am willing to be that if you age this one for many years more, say six or seven that it will taste similar to how Blauw tasted like when I had it not that terribly long ago. Obviously you are gambling here, get a bottle like the one I had at the store and you will totally miss the mark. The Doesjel comes and goes as (s)he or it pleases. And oh yeah, 4.6 for the one at the store and a high 4.8 for the one at home. 4.7 on average.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
