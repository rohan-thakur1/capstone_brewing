I first tried this on cask at the Tigh an Truish Inn, on the Isle of Seil, a few years ago, but have only just got around to rating it. Clear, dark mahogany. Pours good, creamy, light brown head, with fine bubbles, lasting very well. Light carbonation. Aroma - Spicy, sweet toffeeish malt and satisfying, intensely berryish, tangy hops, with some warm, herbiness and a bit metallic. Taste - Mid dry. Intense herby, berry flavoured hops; almost slightly sour medicinal herby taste, which balances out well with the slightly sweet, toffeeish, dark malts and complements the dry finish well. Some slight cola spice & fruit sweetness. Dry, mid-bitter finish, with some slight lingering, pleasant herby & berry fruit hop flavours. A touch of metallic aftertaste too, though. Mid body for the style, bit creamy, bit astringent. A distinctive dark ale, with warm, satisfying flavours and a refreshing, crisp finish. Still good, but its definitely much better on cask, in an old Inn, on a tiny, rocky Scottish island that sticks out into the Atlantic.","Essex, ENGLAND","essexcalf"

3519,"2011-06-12",3.4,"Verre de dégustation, dune bouteille, au Mondial 2011. Arômes de malt légèrement caramélisé. On note aussi une touche de fruits mûrs et un léger houblon fruité. Robe cuivrée et limpide, légère dentelle et effervescence moyenne. Très délicate en bouche, on remarque un léger malt fruité et chocolaté, présentant même des angles boisés et fumés. Très belle texture en bouche et caractère de fermentation très propre (on dirait presque une lager). Finale présentant une délicate amertume houblonnée. Très agréable.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MJGG"
3519,"2011-06-09",3.7,"My Bottom Line:
Toasted malts are balanced out by herbal hops and their bitterness in this prickly and hugely satisfying Mild Ale.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the russet brown.
-Light caramel undertones are perfectly harmonious with the rest of the flavor profile.
-The bitter hop finish is also nicely dry.
-Some nutty angles are also tasted. Nice malt complexity for such an easygoing brew.
-Hops dont take center stage in this one, but do contribute from aroma to finish.
-These guys obviously know how to bottle properly. Every bottled brew Ive had from them so far has been as pleasant as their cask ales.
