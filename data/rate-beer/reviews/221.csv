221,"2016-04-06",3.8,"Can. Pours a clear gold body under a one finger fizzy white head that left some nice lace. The nose is clean bready malt with a light citrusy hoppiness, very delicate. The flavor is pretty solid, clean bready malt with a nice bright hoppiness and the perfect amount of bitterness on the finish. With the fairly heavy hoppiness in this, it closely resembles a Pils, but the softness and slight fruitiness separates it. Light bodied and very soft on the palate with soft fizzy carbonation. Pretty tasty stuff, much better than expected.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"
221,"2016-03-27",3.6,"Draft at the brewpub. Pale gold in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas are of grainy pilsner malt, white grape skin, and herbal hops. Flavors are of very clean (ie: not fruity) with more pronounced pilsner malt and a solid dose of herbal hops. Light bodied with a mineral finish. Perhaps the hoppies kolsch Ive had. Good stuff.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
221,"2016-03-23",3.4,"Can from World Beer Market (Sake no Taniguchi). Light bready and citrus nose, with hay, grass. Thin pale straw color, filmy head.

221,"2016-01-27",3.5,"Maui Brewing's Kihei Kölsch 5.2%

I've gotta say my first impression is that this looks like a pretty kölsch-a matte gold with a soapy white head of foam.

The aroma is sweet light crackery malts and lemons.

Effervescent carbonation and light body with a dry finish.

The taste is soda bread, bitter lemon hop notes and a dry bready finish.

Maybe a bit too lemon forward but a cut above most US Kölschs I've had.

Slightly cloudy yellow golden color with a small white head. 
Grassy hops, mild tartness and some sweet maltiness in the aroma.

221,"2015-10-09",3.1,"appearance: bright yellow, thick, foamy, bright white head shrinking to a thick collar; decent lacing.  aroma: big bright nose full of grassy, floral, piney hops, light citrus.  taste: surprisingly bitter up front, with floral and piney hops, some citrus, then a hint of honey and a little grass.  finish: a little malt comes out at the end, but mainly lingering floral bitterness and some aspirin. notes: Didnt care for this one overmuch. Felt almost more like a Belgian-style IPA than a true kolsch. Flavors and aroma were overly-hopped for the style, and the finish was astringent and slightly medicinal. Needed a much more delicate hand with the hopping and a slightly firmer malt body to stay true to the style in my mind. Not a bad beer per se, just not what I was hoping for.","Maryland, USA","JDBaker11058"

Head is initially average sized, frothy, white, mostly diminishing.
Body is light to medium yellow.

Aroma is lightly malty (toasted grain), moderately hoppy (herbs), with a light note of DMS.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation.

Surprisingly decent showing from Maui Brewing, who almost always scores in the 2s. Crisp, assertively bitter flavor balance and fluffy mouthfeel make it a joy to quaff, and the head retention is quite good as well. Aroma is simple but the hops are bright...only downside is a fleeting minor veggie note, but it only peeks out occasionally so it doesnt ruin the show. Fairly solid, especially for a style most American breweries screw up.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Light esters and dough. The flavor is a little too heavy on the grass and butter for me. It does have a pleasant sweetness of bread and pale malts, but too much bitterness on the finish.
