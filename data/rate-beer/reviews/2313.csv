Sweet honey, black berry alcohol and sugary notes. Medium carbonation and medium thick palate. Flavor is heavy sweet followed by spicy and burnt bitterness. Aftertaste is sweet and alcoholic.

Not (only) 9 % abv, but 9,5  a little bit better !!
Pour le reste une superbe étiquette (avec dans la version 75 cl, un cordon rouge 
amplement mérité, nous allons le vérifier).
Couleur roux acajou translucide de toute beauté.
Clarté absolument nette, comme une source pure au milieu du cresson.
Bulles splendides en colonne centrale dans un geyser torsadé qui les projette
par milliers jusquen haut de la coupe. Sublime.
Mousse beige moyen superbe, à la texture crémeuse, qui vient couvrir le breuvage
comme la dentelle sur lautel. Merveilleux.
Arômes de fruits mûrs, chocolat noir, café suprême, cognac vieux, whisky speyside
de 25 ans, pointe darmagnac 30 ans Laubade.
1ère bouche à la texture veloutée et la merveilleuse entame sur les fruits mûrs, 
avec une pointe de noisette, amandes et tabac brun.
Arrière-bouche très longue avec du bois de fût, pointe de muscade fine.
2ème bouche sur ensemble magnifique de saveurs très complexes comprenant
fruits, bois, céréales, et les épices des dieux (uniquement pour ceux qui boivent
en leur compagnie).
Arrière-bouche assez longue pour faire le tour de France en 5 minutes.
3ème bouche qui nous dit que la bière est un bien triste mot pour qualifier ce
breuvage divin. Ou que les mots sont bien insignifiants dans leur pouvoir à 
transcire les sensations. Je vous laisse choisir  Arrière-bouche avec 
bois, fruits, fleurs, agrumes, haies vives, malt puissant, épices, alcools nobles, etc etc.
La longueur nous installe dans un rocking chair pour regarder les rocky mountains
et rêver à la grande aventure en dansant avec les loups...
Nous sommes devant le nectar du grand sachem...
La levure est dune noblesse à toute épreuve, fine, épanouie. Cest la squaw de cette bière.
Lalcool fait un travail gigantesque sur le sentier de la guerre, il soutient toutes les
étapes de la dégustation comme le ferait le guerrier indien ayant grimé sa figure.
La finale est dun gigantisme dans le développement des saveurs. On est abasourdi
par tant de splendeurs, un peu comme devant le Taj Mahal. Rien ne nous semble
plus beau que les impressions quasi mystiques de cette bière.



CONCLUSION : une bière strictement inouïe, qui livre tout ce quelle a dans le 
ventre pour le mettre dans notre ventre à nous !! Un délice pur, un nectar du grand
manitou  Merci à the rocky abbey pour nous faire toucher le paradis en présence
des dieux, tout en invoquant le totem pour nous délivrer (sans jeu de mots)
dautres aussi bonnes bouteilles. Pour mon 500ème rate, je donnerai donc 555 sur 
100 à cette merveille. (Score que jai déjà donné ailleurs, mais il faut chercher,
cela se mérite!!!). Et si vous ouvrez bien les yeux, vous verrez que le site donne pour cette
bière un scoring de 100/100, ce qui est déjà un premier signe de sa valeur

Soft nuances of chocolate malts and some dark candied sugar. Im a bit surprised that it smelled like this to be honest, but I like the rough earthy cellar aromas. Brings back memories. Oh, it has that light as a cloud mouthfeel. Its really fluffy in texture and the carbonation is above average. Hmm.. Its melting on the tongue this. Lots of sweetness in this.

Now.... with that out of the way. This is an otherwise incredible beer.

Aroma is prunes, raisins, caramel, toffee, figs, dates. Biblical if you catch my drift.

Palate is a perfect, just thick enough for the flavors and just thin enough to not become cloying.
Overall, this is a great find. It seems to exist as proof positive that all of the ""appearance is proof of a well made beer"" yahoos are wrong. This is an amazing beer that is ugly as sin. Find it, buy it, put a blindfold on if you have to , and drink it.","California, USA","dukeredhair"

After the wait, what greeted my nostrils was dried apricots, bready yeast, caramels, peaches, and cherries.  Its as if everytime I sniff, a different stone fruit scent appears.   Flavor is pretty much directly aligned with whats contained in the aroma, with the sweet peach showing up more predominately, and its also matched with some toffee and raisin.

Eventually the head reduces but sustains with excellent lacing.  Aroma reveals a soft tartness, cherry, caramelized sugar, honey glazed pears, dried fruits, and is ever evolving as it warms, becoming sweeter and bringing out more honey, toffee, and fig.  Highly carbonated feel hides the fullness of the body, making it seem medium bodied, although I suspect its quite heavy.  Flavor includes chocolate covered cherry, caramel.  I guess if I think about it I can see the almonds too.  Overall pretty outstanding, very complex, and very enjoyable.

Pours a moderate caramel-red color with loads and loads of floaties. Bit of a light tan head that goes away fairly quickly and doesnt leave behind much lacing. The nose has some dark fruits and a bit of sweet malt. Some dark sugar there and a bit of yeast. The flavor is along the same lines. Its nice and smooth, but there isnt much complexity to it, especially considering its age. Feel is medium with low carbonation. Somewhat chewy, adding a breadiness to the flavor. Pretty good, but not earth shattering.

Pleasantly mild, slight vinous taste. Palate is a bit grainy. Vinous front palate, caramel maltyness mid palate, and lots of grain and cereal on back of palate. Generally, a bit sweet.

Mouth feel is creamy with a somewhat grainy texture to finish. 

Was somewhat surprised when read on back of bottle abv is 9.5%  alcohol covered up quite well. 

Had a glass of Triple Imperiale by this brewery on draft at Blind Lady Ale House yesterday (NYE), which was absolutely phenomenal with its tart and fruity taste as well as its very similar color (ie, instead of golden like most triples), so had high expectations for this beer. Unfortunately, expectations only partially met. Though enjoyable, liked the Triple Imperiale much more.","San Diego, California, USA","AHTOH"

I tried this beer on December 15, 2010 at ""Smokeless Joes"" in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  The beer poured a translucent reddish-brown (when held to the light) with a huge genrous foamy light brown head that lasted long after the beer did.  The aroma was dark caramel malt, candy sugar, plums, and yeast.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied with ample carbonation.  The flavour was sweet malt, candy sugar, yeast, dark fruit.....and a nice bitter finish.  An excellent beer.","Milton, Ontario, CANADA","cyrenaica"

The flavor is equally complex with lots of sweet fruity maltiness, cherry, caramel, with a hint of oxidation.

Potent and complex nose of numerous fruits, fresh baked bread, and pepper.  Taste is similar to the nose with a spicy, peppery bite up front that stays to form the finish.  In ""the middle"" as the beer passes over the tongue, you get a rapid avalanche of grape, citrus, raisins, cherries, caramel, Ritz crackers and bread.

Flavor is similar to the aroma but doesnt have a lot of depth. The chunks are strange to get around, but to me, thats where the flavor is. Incredibly easy to drink and the alcohol is very well hidden. Impressively, this is not syrupy like many others. Much easier to drink.","Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, USA","basewars"

Flavor: Despite the floaters, this tasted fine.  Caramel and toffee up front with dark fruits in the finish.  Chocolate also appears after a few seconds.

Very evocative aroma of apricot, Hawaian bread.
Creamy expansive mouthfeel. Very smooth. Slight bitter nutty finish.
Tastes very similar to the Brune, but definitely missing something special that puts that one way over the top. Well, this is just one bottle, so perhaps subsequent bottles will be even better. Off topic, but I always wonder if the fluctuating temperature in my apartment hurts the beers. I like this a lot. In my mind, Abbaye des Rocs is definitely one of the truly distinctive Belgian brewers. Extreme globules of coagulated proteins(?) in the end of the bottle. I picked some out and am literally staring at a solid chunk about 1cm on my finger. Siick... (eats it) tastes like a solidified version of the beer itself, very gross but cool at the same time.

2313,"2008-06-04",4.2,"bottle, and a bit of a gusher.  pours with a thick fizzy tan head that quickly fades to a moderately thick foamy tan head.  pretty clear amber, except for the giant chunks of floaties just zooming around in the glass.  brilliant vinous smell, with all sorts of crazy spicy fruit esters coming out:  apples, pears, cherries, tangerines?, apricots?, raisins, maybe a bit of grapefruit.  i swear every time i smell it, i pick out a different note, and i dont have to hold it anywhere near my nose to get a good whiff.  all this is piloted by a solid brown sugar/caramel malt scent.  the same caramel malt dominates, and gains a bit of a nutty flavor as well, and is backed up by another bucket of spicy fruit esters, with raisins taking the lead, backed up by a nice cherry note, with dozens of others mingling in the background.  fairly sweet finish, with a very subtle tartness, and a barely perceptible bitter tingle.  relatively full-bodied, with a sort of thick, creamy mouthfeel that doesnt seem like carbonation has much part in (it does, but the bubbles are so small they go almost unnoticed).  this is some seriously good shit.  incredibly complex smell, great flavor, one of my favorites.  chewing on chunks of yeast might turn off some people, though.","pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","hiddenvariable"
2313,"2008-06-01",3.9,"Pours a light brown with an unbelievable amount of sediment and a good, thick beige head. No kidding - there were dark spots on top of the head where it actually held up some of the sediment as it poured. Smells like a dream. Sweet and tart fruits - apples, plums, golden raisins, figs and a bit of not-quite-ripe strawberry. Yeast, light malts (much like light molasses), and baking spices - cloves and allspice. One last thing in the aroma that took a while to pick out - honest to God, it smells a bit like one of those strawberry shortcake ice cream bars. Flavor isnt quite as complex as the nose. The yeast comes through heavily (could have guessed from the floaties), and its a little more tart than sweet. The darker of the fruits still show through, and the taste does round out as it warms, adding toasted almonds (they were right on about that). This one is fantastically complex - the best Ive had from Abbaye des Rocs.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"

Also notes of toffee, grain, and mild sour notes, orange and chocolate, brown sugar. Mild spicy notes of what appears as coriander, cinnamon.

Clearly infected but I like Saisons so Ill say this is actually pretty good considering.

Smell is sort of candy sweetness with some fruitty aromas also, Some darker scents possibly roasted malt or nuts maybe, an almost honey sweetness with a slight alcohol astringency.

Leaned a little too much on the candy sweetness and tartness for me, and just lacked the superb balance that Iove about the brune.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Pours a darkish golden color with spritzy head that stuck around surprisingly well, suspended bubbles, and the infamous and somewhat off-putting suspended sediment. First thing that hit me in the aroma was tangerines, and certainly very fruity overall including apple and pear. Flavor was similarly fruity, had some semi-sour grapes, butterscotch, increasing spices present as it warmed. Mouthfeel was for the most part light and spritzy as from the head, until the bottom of the glass when it became...chunky. Ill give it a pass on that though. Overall a very good beer once you get past that sediment that I mention here a third time. Didnt make me say WOW, but did make me say Mmm, tasty!","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
2313,"2008-01-26",4.4,"The cap shoots off, nearly embedding itself in the ceiling. 
Carbonation ominously rises towards the top of the bottle, so I must pour quickly into my snifter. Auburn body is home to a bazillion floaty yeast particles. Head is tan and sticky. Great retention with some Belgian lacing.

Nose consists of mostly dark fruits but theres some citrus tartness there too.

Taste has a huge dried apricot character, with hints of cherry, canned peach, pepper, caramel. Very sweet and rich.

Full body, perfect carbonation. The yeast is a little too much though. Texture was almost smoothie-like, which is not particularly appetizing in a beer. Finish is less sticky than youd expect from such a sweet beer.

Drinkability is similarly hindered by the yeast coagulations. Great tasting beer, but hard to get through.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

I thought I was going to love it, being one of the highest rated belgians available, but it tasted like it had a slight skunk to it. Ive never tasted a beer that had such a dissonant taste/flavor respect. It smells wonderful, like sour lime juice, apples, and biscuits. But the taste is all yeasty. All yeasty with the alcohol churning the yeast to an undesirable overwhelming yeast bomb. The sugars are nice and arrive just in time to save the beer and turn it into a nice finisher.","Maryland, USA","Skeegle"

The particulates are large and dense, very similar to lots of pulp style orange juice. From the pour the nose is very floral, resembling more of rose petals, sweet malts, citrus fruits and mild caramel also play into the background character of this aroma. The overall aroma is vibrant and enticing for the taste to come.  Initial taste is very complex, hands down. Liquid candy pours over the mouth, sweet malts render, powered sugar is also apparent. The fruits are the next level of taste along with fig & other dried fruits and mild cocoa.  As the beer warmed the taste changed into more of a bakery cookie & pastry distinctiveness. The palate finishes strong as the intial taste, there is no stopping it now. Finishing with a syrupy sweet malts, cocoa, fruits and mild bitterness. Dry & chalky. Palate duration is good. Some lacing of the glass, good head retention and to mention absolutely remarkable particulates like no other. Medium body. Alcohol is well masked and this brew a delightful experience.","Norwood, Massachusetts, USA","Alldaydrinker"

As you drink it the flavor is so complex that your  taste buds go crazy.

The nose is a complex bouquet of light and red fruits, including pear, apple, grapes, plums, cherries and a slew of other fruits I cant identify. Floral tones are jump out too. There is definitely an aroma of hoeny and caramel behind it too, as advertised. As it warms a buttery presence accompanies the other scents. The flavour is like candy, with overripe fruits, almost like caramel apples, with some molasses on the finish. There are no metallic, plasticy or astringent notes to be detected, just intense malt sweetness. As it warms, the depth of the malty flavours increases, with cookie-like flavours.

Lesser almond, red grape, peach, white pepper.  Sediment-rich deep red, somewhat brown body with a huuuge, fluffy, rocky, lacing tanned head.  Gorgeous!  Extremely complex taste begins up front with the blend of spices, somewhat sweet initially but morphs eventually into a dry and gentle mid-body with a gentle, dry, very slightly warming aftertaste.  Same notes as in the aroma, including strong cherry and yeast, but with the addition of honey/meadish notes.  Balanced, smooth, and soft, a masterwork of beer-making.  Refreshing and dangerously drinkable - go slow, young man! and enjoy this with time, though it is by no means a sipper; alcohol is very well-hidden and the medium body is reminiscent of a good session.

After getting the bottle to settle down and poured  it and saw all sorts of suspended particles (I got nervous so I checked RB and saw that I had nothing to fear), along with the funky chunks of yeast wastes.  The beer is a pleasant carmel brown color, it has a very complex flavor; I noticed carmel, malt, a little bit o hops and, a wee bit of fruit.  They beer finishes pretty clean and really compliments the wine cheese spead my wife got at Cheese Haven in Port Clinton, Ohio.  Try this beer and if you can do it with good cheese, highly recommended.  This beer would have gotten a higher rating if it were not for those funky particles, but for the experience of drinking it I wont complain.","Somewhere in, Ohio, USA","dankman"

It is sweet and contains aged caramel malt, cherry, vanilla, apple, caramel, and aged/dried fruit (apricots!).  The flavor is deep and also complex with lots of sweet fruity maltiness, cherry, caramel/carmelized sugar, and has a hint of oxidation.

Theres lemon zest, light Italian flat leaf parsley, and glowing brandy. Figs and walnuts pop in. Alcohols warms and carries a delicate bouquet to the nostrils.

Best before 2007

As with other Des Rocs ales the Grand Cru pours loaded with big heavy protein chunks. They break up somewhat but are still thick. The body of this beer would look amazing if not for the floaties. Glowing ruby body with a 1+ finger loose ivory head one the pour. Head fades to a thick half finger cap. Leaves spotty lacing.

Smell is absolutely packed with different aromas. Sweet doughy malts combine with spicy alcohol up front. Brown sugar and dark fruits show up halfway through. Cherries, plums, and figs. The backend brings powdered sugar, nutmeg, and a faint spicy hoppiness. The longer your nose stays in the beer the more the aroma changes.

Flavor is a little of a let down after the wonderful aromas. Much like the smell doughy malts kick things off. Mid palate a some of the darker fruits that were mentioned in the smell hit the tastebuds. There is also, a very mild metallic twang every now and then. Not bad but not an improvement either. The swallow brings brown sugar, slight alcohol warmth, and a mild floral hoppiness. This beer gets much better as it warms. 

Medium body with a coating mouthfeel. Slightly sticky. The mouthfeel is good but I just dont like getting one of those bigger protein chunks. 

Good flavor and a wonderful aroma help this beer go down pretty easy. To me it seems like it would be more appropriate for cooler weather instead of a hot night like tonight.

Another tasty treat from Des Rocs. My only complaint of their beers are the huge amount of chunky settlement. Des Rocs beers are excellent but if the sediment was taken a little better care of they would be world class.

Floral/herbal mintiness with tropical notes of pineapple and ginger.  Warming intensifies the spice and herbal character, bringing out more mint, flowers and tropical fruit.  The aroma and flavour are really incredible.  The only drawback to this beer is the gelatinous chunks that are not only ugly but can actually be felt in the mouth, reminding me of those tapioca balls in bubble tea.

This bottle started to explode foam all over the place as soon as i cracked the cap off so i had to rush to get the remainder into the glass without over pouring its content. Still created huge foaming in the glass but died in a matter of seconds like some chemistry reaction with oxygen being the instigator. Strong aroma of yeast and spice and the ale looks like a murky light colored brown. The drink is very subdued and has lost its potential carbonation and has gone flat.  Very sweet, however, with the same taste of the Abbaye des Rocs Triple Impériale.

I enjoyed this beer a lot so please dont think I am saying otherwise. I also must say that this beer was one of the creamiest I have tried thus far. This beer was ridiculously smooth, and creamy. I have yet to try a beer that tops this palate.

Fruity, almost sour flavor, but balanced with sweeter malts and caramel. Some hops came through. Very complex, kind of dry, with a light mouthfeel.

Creamy and smooth in the mouth, and though this bottle was a gusher, theres no fizziness here.  Its as though the brew has enough viscosity to contain the bubbles.  The flavors are fanstastically big and malty.  Again, more like a barleywine than most Belgians, though I see how this could bleed into quad territory.  Big caramel malt and light fruit, with some stronger cherry notes.  A bit of sherry and portiness here, but less so than the more prominent chocolate and creaminess.  A bit of that Belgian funk to remind you of where its coming from.  Well balanced fruit with malt.  Alcohol is barely perceptible.

Smell; tons of dark fruits, with cherries, plums, dates, apples and bits of citrus. Brown sugar and cinnamon come through along with some spices I cant quite place. This one smells really damn good.

Taste: sweet toffee and brown sugar hit me up front, as well as cocoa and sugar cookies. The fruits filll out the middle with apples, plums, cherries and apricots. The finish is slightly nutty and yeasty, with a mild peppery spiciness, and just some hints of alcohol. The flavor is just what you would expect following the aroma, just wonderful. Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied, and so drinkable that...damnit whered my beer go?","Where the hell am I?, Nebraska, USA","RedHaze"
2313,"2007-01-13",4.9,"Pours a ruby brown, topped by at least 2"" of soft and fluffy beige foam. Good head retention and very nice lacing. Lots (I mean whole lots) of dark brown yeast floaties swimming around. They never seem to settle (maybe I drink too fast?)...

Aroma of caramel and chocolate covered raisins with faint cherry. A bready and yeasty aroma comes out as it warms. 

Wow - what an incredible mix of flavor. Malty - caramel, dark honey, and toffee. Fruity - fig, date, dark sweet cherry, plum, and tart gooseberry. The fruitiness becomes even more pronounced and complex as it warms. Spicy - dry spiciness in the finish with nutmeg, vanilla, and a hint of bread yeast. Anything else - why yes - how about a little bit of warming and soothing rum? Absolutely delicious.

Great rich mouthfeel - yet exceptionally smooth and maybe the softest beer ever. Lots and lots of very gentle carbonation.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"

2313,"2007-01-05",3.8,"11.2 oz bottle with what appears to be a mostly illegible best before 08 date, served in a Chimay goblet.  

Fruity aroma with background hints of yeast, alcohol and caramel malt.  Reddish brown in color, fairly clear, with a 1/2 finger, long-lasting, light tan head.  Many fine floaters are swimming merrily about - perhaps the reslt of hand-warming an over-chilled bottle.  First take on the flavor is that it is rich and zingy, complex, and rapidly evolving.  Mouthfeel is of rough cream, followed by rich hop flavor notes, background malty flavor notes, followed by a dry finish.  I can feel the alcoholic warming in the back of my throat and belly almost immediately.

Nose is pungent and fruity; raisins, caramelized cherries, sweet honey, plums, and apricots.  Flavor matches nicely; plums, apricots, caramelized cherries, raisin, faint Belgian chocolate, molasses, maybe some ginger in there too.  Bitterness is minimal but keeps from being cloyingly sweet.  Palate is nearly full, creamy and almost chewy, and more than soft; alcohol is very well hidden, maybe too hidden for a Belgian strong.  Finishes long and sweet with mild bitterness and a nutty character.

Well, Im buying everything the brewers selling in the commercial description, and this beers been rated almost 500 times as of tonight, but it would be shoddy not to at least try to find some fresh language to describe what this one has to offer. Fantastic beer. Pours dark brown, almost mahogany. Slightly geysery--you have just enough time to throw away the cap and the foil before a few timid bubbles start to peer over the mouth of the bottle. Nice thick moussy tan head, no lace, but the head sure does stick around. Whats to add to the description? The nose of cherries, raisins, peaches, dried fruit, honey, and caramel is there. Its all beautifully combined, theres no careless overemphasis on any one note. Cherry, caramel, chocolate, almonds, molasses...they describe the palate as well as anything I could offer. The mouthfeels gorgeous: coming up on thick, coming up on fizzy, but really just nice and velvety and satisfying. Everything about this beers lovely. Would dearly love to see it on draft around here somewhere.

Is ths normal?
Now on to the beer itself, the aroma is great!  Aroma of sugar soaked cherries and peaches, other sweets, more fruits, almost candied sweet smell.  I really like this!  On to the taste, a lot of yeasty flavors come through...or wait maybe that is the chunks of yeast and sedment that I actually feel going down as I drink this.  Maybe this one needed to go through a strainer...Anyways back to the taste, there is defintely some hints of the sweet cherries and peache flavors that I picked up in the smell, along with some carmel sweetness.  Boy looking back over this it sounds like nothing but sweetness going on, but there is a nice dry finish to it...maybe from the yeast contribution.  Overall a pretty good beer, I wouuld like to get a hold of another bottle to see if there is any drastic difference in the amount of sediment...I cant get over it!!!!","Green, Ohio, USA","LeopoldStoch"

Very dried fruit like aromas, dried apricot, prunes, sweet gooseberry, and a touch of ginger/coriander thrown in.

Drank this at room temp and the flavor was big and dry, pruney dried fruits with lots of honey and alcohol, vinous notes and molasses in the dry finish.

Even some vigorous swirling couldnt deflate it.  Flavor:  Malt jumps out first.  Nice flavors of caramel and toffee with a strong bready flavor.  Lots of cherry and plum notes shining through.

After letting this one sit for a while to contain the floating particles, I
   popped it open on a cool Friday night.  It certainly was satisfying despite
   the excessive foam upon opening and the resulting mess of yeast chunks.  If
   you want to try it, go ahead and get the 750ml bottle which should be only
   a little more - otherwise like me youll regret running out after only one
   glass.
Aroma / Appearance - A rich mixture of caramel, chocolate dipped
   honeycrisp apples, malt, pears and dusty old books played with my nose.
   The body was a dark burgandy color with lots of carbonation.  I could feel
   the pressure as it opened; in fact I had to back off to keep it from forcing
   the last half of the bottlecap from flying off.  A tan one-finger head sat
   on top, covering the floating yeast chunks.
Flavor / Palate - Drinking this was a great experience.  Apples,
   molasses, honey, caramel, bittersweet chocolate and ripe bananas all blended
   together into a pleasing smooth impression.  Next came brown sugar, melons and
   then the background malts.  The final few sips were like drinking liquid wheat
   bread.  Overall the alcohol was well balanced but came forward towards the
   end.  The sourness at the end was a nice suprise.  Given the price of a 750
   ml bottle, I will definitely be using this to introduce people to the world
   of craft beer.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Pours reddish-brown with some sediment; the nose offers a lucious aroma of golden raisins, candied pear, papaya, persimmon, and woody dried apricots.
The flavor is...wow. The flavor is marvelously complex and ever-shifting through each sip. Off the top, Im tasting the caramel and raisins and fruits (especially peach in the flavor)  as expected from the aroma, but Im also getting a strong black peppercorns and licorice, Im getting red cherries and a hint of vanilla, and there is a corky, woody dryness long into the late side of the finish. No sign whatsoever of the 9.5% alcohol; this one sips like a 6.5% beer.

This is a spendid beer, certainly a sweet beer, perhaps just a tad thin on the mouth, but outrageously good. Its just superb. It does best close to room temperature; starting at cellar temperature and letting it warm from there is certainly fine; no need to refrigerate. 9/5/9/4/18=4.5

2006 bottle (330 ml) sampled Jan 30th 2008  I bet I rated this one a bit too high and had planned to re-rate tonight on the heals of a Bernardus 12. But instead I get a huge gusher. Infected aroma and flavor. Yuck; down the drain. For now Ill knock one point off of the overall for quality control, this being the second time such has happened to me with these, and wait for a clean bottle to re-rate.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

MURKY, light, reddish brown with moussy, tan head that dissipates to medium thick film (but lasts nicely through the glass).  Definitely better than it looks, this beer is nutty up front with some, complex fruity flavors as well.  Yeasty, but not quite astringent from yeast flavors.  Some definite milk-chocolate notes.  A minor lactic acidity is lurking back there too.  Slightly bitter on the back end with yeast astringency more noticable.  Full bodied.  Caramel notes in the finish and final aromas.  Very nice.","USA","smcd"

Sugary and cola and pruney aromatic notes.  Full and lively body.  Granted, its only a half percent lower in alcohol than the triple, the alcohol note is much more subtle.

Not wanting to waste it, I had to lick it off the counter top, but didnt trust licking the floor. After I got things under control, this one poured a muddy brown, with impressive tan head that mostly diminished but left behind nice lace rings.

2313,"2005-10-01",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 17, 2005 Pours a dense copper sprinkled with yeast flakes and capped of a fizzy beige head that convolutes into a cappuccino swirl. The nose is sweet and wet reminding of luscious fruits like pinneaple, orange and pear. Some honey appears, but has a fresh flowery quality, almost like nectar, maybe honeysuckle. Malts provide balance with lots of roasted caramel and a hint of dry chocolate. The velvety coffee, banana and apple sauce flavors that rise initially complement the rich creamy texture. Thin lacing covers all edges of the glass as you degust every sip of this brew. Some sweet spices such as cinnamon make a light appearance before the dry grapefruit finish. A little metallic in the aftertaste but delicious and unique in its style.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"
2313,"2005-09-29",4.4,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2007 When I went on my most recent beer browsing I brought along my French friend who has extensive experience with Belgian beers.  The trip was nothing special, though he was happy to see that my local liquor store had a nice selection of local micros and the occasional rare European beer.  We walked for awhile, taking a few notes, then all of a sudden he gasped, spun on his heels and pressed his face against the glass.  His eyes starting dilating and his language reverted back to French, sputtering non-sensical eau and ou syllables.  There was, he said, a gem of unbelievable value in that refrigerator, which happened to be the Grand Cru.  Waving goodbye to financial moderation we bought a four pack and took it back home in the shadows of the night so no envious beer fans would hijack our vehicle and make off with our pricey elixir.
	Perhaps elixir isnt the best word.  Elixir sounds like a clarified, purified extract of ancient magic, which this beer comes close to.  But its actually very cloudy.  In fact, it looks like a hazy smoke drifting inside the liquid bottle.  The color looks like a special copper, perhaps a metallurgists alloid, but the shading lends itself more to the burning smoke analogy.  The aroma lacks the scent of smoke the image suggests, but it contains all the usual apple and banana that I like to find in Belgian strong ales.  Most unique was an overpowering (and very welcome) smell of fresh, wet flowers.  Putting my nose to the glass rim felt like stepping into a small flower shop.  Being a fan of peanut butter in its myriad forms I was also pleased by Grand Crus peanuty scent, though it was an after thought compared to the other aromatic compounds.  
	To Americans there is a great deal of mysticism associated with cloistered little stone buildings hiding in the grassy corners of Europe, but they seem so well hidden.  The Abbay de Rocs Grand Cru doesnt hide its origins, but proudly displays its place of birth on the label with an endearing drawing of three sunlit abbey windows.  The photograph of the brewery on RateBeer.com confirms the castle-like architecture, and above all the taste affirms the skill and craft practiced behind those granite walls.  Its a fairly dry beer, as my experience with Belgian Strong ales go, with a lot of grape leading the pack of flavors.  We must also take time for a courteous obeisance to the carbonation, which has found its perfect level within the beer.  There is also just enough alcohol to wave at as you walk by; a nice departure from beers where the alcohol taste runs out the door and slams your head into the ground until you bleed to death.  At higher temperatures the beer takes on more vegetable tones, almost with a salty character, but soon reverts back to apple sauce.  Overall the taste mellows, but stays intact.  This beer never sings louder than beautiful.

January 14th, Logans Grand Cru Tasting  3 years or older Abbaye de Rocs Grand Cru.  Aroma was wood, raisin, pine, gin, alcohol, grapes and fig.  Mouthfeel had good weight.  Taste was alcohol, pine, more tree bark, burnt wood, burnt caramel, graham cracker and licorice.  Sticky.  Brasserie de Rocs Vintage had a similar smell, but the mouth feel was lighter with more caramel and hops and less burnt wood.  Aftertaste is more hollow and peripheral.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

2313,"2005-09-18",4.7,"Pours a splendid brown, hazy, with a massive billowy head, lots of floaties, and great lace.  Aroma is full by dark fruits.  Cherry dominates, some apricot, raisen,  apple, and berry (rasberry?) form a splendid bouquet.  Flavor is great as well.  Initially toasty and a bit salty, becoming very sweet and tart, a port wine flavor, cherries, toffee, wood notes, citrus, dry bitter hops, and a long apricot finish.  Alcohol makes its presence known, though actually helps balance the sweet undertones.  An incredibly rich and complex beer.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sethdude"

Reddish brown and cloudy with a thick off white head that lasts and lasts. Very spicey aroma with tons of dried fruit and currants while backed by a sweet lingering finish. Carries on some in the flavor where you get a wonderful balance of sweet and sour fruits, exotic spices, a warming alcohol sensation, and plenty of nuts to balance it all out. It is extremely fizzy which Im not usually fond of but it works here. Wonderful stuff.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"
2313,"2005-09-08",4.5,"Pours brown and chunky, though less so than their Brune in both departments. A large pearl head leaves some lacing. When looking for effervescence (impossible in so murky a beer), I noticed that the chunks move about in some seemingly choreographed dance of deliciousness. Aroma of raisins, chocolate, leather, honey, fruits both dark and light, licorice. The flavor is, in a word, elegant. The commercial description says something about cherries dipped in caramel, and I sort of agree. Im also getting that chocolate, honey, and a bit of the leather. Some nutty notes, as well. The finish is dry, but a sweetness creeps back in a couple seconds after the swallow. Id venture to say that its better than the Brune, which I though was the final word in Belgian Strongs. This one is a bit sweeter up front and a bit longer-lasting on the finish.","Winchester, Virginia, USA","jmuhops"

The strong melanoidin from the aroma does not become an overly spicy flavour, as expected, but a gentle cerealy pumpernickel wich combines nicely with sweet caramel and dried apricots.   Also, there was less woody bitterness than the aroma suggested, but a detectible amount, nonetheless.  A little more bitterness or sourness would have been welcome in this very sweet brew.

I tasted a slightly burnt spiced flavor-laden beer with cinnamon-like fruit tones and sweet hops. The finish was not too dry and has a touch of vanilla in there. What I like most is that it is very complex yet not saucy in its flavor like other Grand Cru beers Ive sampled.

Sweet and spicy, but I get bits of many other Belgians I have had in the flavor. Nothing really radically different like say an Orval. Still you yearn to sip it again.

Aroma is underwhelming, pick up faint notes of caramel and molasses. Smooth flavor, pick up hints of molasses, caramel, candied sugar, but not too pronounced. Very smooth drinking, but nothing that jumps out ant you and says wow! Good thick mouthfeel. A very good Belgian, but a tad overrated in my opinion.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"

2313,"2005-05-10",4.4,"My first top 50 beer in awhile, and Im pretty stoked.  Pours hazy orange/dark straw with big off-white head and a lot of carbonation.  I cannot give a 5 for appearance.  The aroma is caramel bready malt, fruit (cherries, figs, prunes), toffee, cabernet.  Tastes malty, fruity, with finishing smooth crispness, fruity nuts, and some hoppy dryness.  Very complex with a variety of fruit flavors at mid palate and the finish.  Gains caramel, almond, and fruity hints as it warms, and it is exceptionally smooth and velvety....no harshness at all....silky.  I came into this sampling expecting to be let down, and I was WRONG!  Unlike our current president, I have the integrity and testicular fortitude to admit when I am wrong.  This beer is excellent, and a standout.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
2313,"2005-05-07",4.6,"This came in a green 750ml bottle. The body was a deep brown with reddish highlights and a giant fluffy off white head peaking over the top of the glass. As this was consumed sticky rings of lacing were left hung around the glass. Very good head retention as even the last sips had a nice covering of the fluffy head still floating. The smell was sweet with a slight spice to it as well as strong fruit notes. The taste started off with a fruity caramel sweetness that mingled with a bit of spice and yeast flavors. Not overly sweet but just right, the aftertaste is a bit tart as well. Very good taste with a lot of things going on that I will have to have this again to pick up on more of them. This almost has a full body but just falls short not that it hurts it in any way, and its very rich and creamy on the tongue.

Pours brown with an almost reddish tint; the head is full and cream colored. Plenty of floaties in the glass.  Nice aroma while just pouring into the glass. Nice, sweet aroma of brown sugar, raisins, green apples?, caramel, and milk chocolate? The taste is caramel and milk chocolate initially, then some dark fruits. The finish is spicy and slightly hoppy and it keeps a sweetish beer from being too sweet. The body is full. It is very good, but I feel it lacks a bit of depth with the flavor after that incredible quad-like nose. Thanks BuckNaked. ADDITIONAL: The flavor is better now at 64.5°. I would have thought that would have been too warm, but the flavor is a bit more complex at warmer temps, the alcohol is more noticeable too, but certainly not in a detracting way.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Yes, there are copious amounts of fruity notes beyond that, but it really does smell like iced tea.  Flavor has a slight crisp flavor at first, but it does smooth over to real subtle blend of fruits.  Quite a complex beer, and a very drinkable one as well.","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"

This beer resembles red wine a bit more.  The look is somewhat similar to the St. Bernardus 12.  The aroma is wonderful consisting of caramel, fruits which include cherries and raisins, chocolate and quite a bit of wine.  I would say that wine is the dominant factor in the aroma.  The taste is fantastic.  If this were my favorite style the taste would get a 10.  Its still great though so Ill give it a 9.  There is a lot of wine mixed with peach, cherry, caramel, chocolate and almond.  The finish is one of the best ever.  Extra flavors come in plus the wine flavor becomes more apparent.

I didnt really know about it then, and the tapper was actually a hand written note over somebody elses tap handle, so my impression was that it might be a home brew. Anyway, not having had a large enough sample size the first time, I bought a bottle recently. I had a preconceived notion that it would be overly carbonated, thin and tinny. None of these were the case. Rich, molasses, Beligian aroma with a good alcohol presence. Sweet. Some olfactory notes similar to a German weissbier. Excellent aroma. Dark, reddish amber in color with a huge, billowy, off-white head. Excellent lace. Tons of large chunky particalia, which may have been exasserbated by my having stored the large bottle on its side in my fridge. The particalia was a little scary, as most of the time I have drunk something with floaties like this it was bad. Not this time. Although I could occasionally feel the floaties pass my lips, which was a little ishy, once in my mouth, that sensation was lost. Caramel notes pervade on the tongue. Softly carbonated. Good alcohol presence, but doesnt taste anything close to its 10%. Very drinkable and perfectly balanced. Outstanding.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"

2313,"2004-07-31",4.5,"I was pretty excited to try this one for my 200th beer (okay, 202 if I could only remember the names of those other 2 beers).  Its tough to beat the appearance of a good Belgian ale, and thats no exception here.  Poured a ruby/amber/brown color, lots of medium sized yeast particles floating towards the bottom of the glass, with a large frothy mocha/tan colored head.  The head eventually shrank to about 1/8"" creamy layer covering the beer.  Towards the end of the glass the head thinned, but was still there.  Aroma: This beer has one of the best aromas of anything Ive sampled to date.  Its big and not holding back with notes of yeast, sweet malts, honey, carrot, pepper, anise, pears, apples, plums, raisins, and even a little bit of caramel and chocolate.  This is worth buying just for the nose.  Flavor: The taste is big and hearty with hints of pear, plum, raisin, carrot, pepper.  Theres plenty of malt backing to this beer which adds sweetness and somewhat of a syrupy feel to this beer. This malt is equally balanced by a moderate well-rounded hop bitterness that manages not to drown out any of the other flavors.   But it doesnt stop there.  You can also treat your taste buds to sweet chocolate, yeast, coriander, orange, and toffee.  Finishes slightly sweet, mildly acidic, and moderately bitter.  Also noteworthy is how well this beer hides the 10% alcohol.  I could tell that the content was up there, but I didnt get overwhelmed with an alcohol taste at any point while drinking this beer.  You need to try this beer if you havent already because it truly is great.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

Malty front, some pepper and big alcohol immediately.  Sort of shocking spiciness for this style of beer.  Sharp bitterness comes in the middle.  Cobwebby, dry, musty, and yet still quite rich.

2313,"2004-06-08",4.3,"Happy Birthday to me (a special bottle to celebrate my 33rd birthday).  It poured lovely--deep lovely brown/amber/caramel/wood color with a wonderful, dense, off-white lacing that lasted a long time.  Only a particularly large number of yeast chunks was a bit off-putting.  The aroma is complex and intriguing--raisin, ginger ale, cream soda, citrus (orange), clove, ginger, nutmeg, bubblegum, and more.  There isnt that much alcohol to be detected in the aroma and flavor, according to my tastebuds, except a slight effervescence into the nose.  The flavor goes well with a chocolate brownie, or so my wife reported to me from the glass-full I shared with her (its a big bottle afterall and I was in a sharing mood after she made a nice birthday dinner of sausages with onion gravy made of Fullers London Porter instead of red wine).  The flavor is slightly more subtle, not as big, with my most noteworthy impression being how the beer faded from flavors into effects, with a bit of a bitter astringence in the mid-palate in a nice way.  I do see the fig and cherry flavors in particular, which others have noted.  The palate is lovely--a well-supported mass of malts with a lilting and frothing carbonation that keeps going and going.  Overall very satisfying and a very easy drinking Belgian.

2313,"2004-05-02",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 23, 2005 The 750 ml. green bottle was distinguished looking with a cap underlain by a cork.  The cork was very large and broke my corkscrew from its handle while trying to pull it out. A trusty pair of pliers was able to extricate them anyway.  The beer, when poured in the goblet, displayed a deep red color with a 1 ½ inch tall, off-white head, and a fine onrush of bubbles underneath.  The smell is reminiscent of raisins, cherries, plums, and hay.  The taste is also quite fruity with notes of apples, cherries, rum-raisins, as well as some vanilla, and chocolate.   There is also some hoppy dryness in there.  The mouthfeel is buttery smooth, and rich.  The 10 percent by volume alcohol is very well covered.  I was expecting this brew to be a lot more complex, but this turned out to be quite one-dimensional.  May be a few more years on the remaining bottle will eat up more of the residual sugars and generate some complexity.
Update:  The beer is now available in 330 ml. four packs in Georgia, so I decided to try it again (since I had traded away that other 750 ml. bottle picked up in Chattanooga).  Either the beer was more fresh, or my palette had evolved, but gone was the cloying sweetness that bothered me so much last time.  Instead this bottle displayed a perfect balance between sweet, spicy, tart, yeasty, and bitter flavors. 9.5% ABV was not evident anywhere in the taste.  I certainly enjoyed it a lot better this time.  And the heady carbonation, and the resulting full burps were an outstanding finishing touch.  And there was no way to sip this one.  It just begged to be quaffed.  Liquid Crack.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
2313,"2004-05-02",4.0,"Well-rounded brew showing typical Belgian malt blending expertise. Pours a good, clean head and shows the natural rust color of the malts. Nice lacing and well-carbonated. Pleasant, soft aroma. Fruity, applespice sweetness dominates the flavor (as with any brew at 10% alcohol) but definitely not ""sugary"". Perhaps could use just a little more hops added to round it off. Still highly recommended and a good deal at under $8 for a 750 ml bottle. Goes good with a meal; beer like this can be saved for at least a couple of sittings -- no need to finish it all at once.","St. Paul, Minnesota, USA","BeerAteHer"
2313,"2004-04-27",4.2,"Big thanks to jcalabre for this very special brew. Displays beautiful color in the glass, yeasty sweet fruity spicy signature aroma drifts out to entice. As noted by most, this is a complex flavor array, best enjoyed by slowly savoring in the proper glassware. After a bit of tang, the flavors settle into a full but smooth texture and satisfying finish. With all that is going on, cherries & honey & caramel & yeast & nuts & on & on, it is balanced to perfection and hardly shows it's 10%.

2313,"2004-04-12",5.0,"POP!
The cork is off, there's no turning back, in we go...A lovely, hazy tumult of deep auburn colored brew pours into my glass, joined by a Brobdignagian layer of fizzy, creamy, off-orange foam. Looks good so far, I'm tingling so far.
Aroma: lemon...biscuits...orange...must...sour...but sweet...cinnamon...a spiced lemon cookie, to wrap it succinctly. Nice. Lively, luscious, in an utterly other realm than any other beer I've ever sniffed.
Taste...Good Idea, let's!
Oh, it's happening again! A shockwave of pleasure engulfs and enwraps my body and all the senses. Certainly very winey in flavor, but uniquely beery, too! Softly peppery, deep in dark fruit (besides grape, we wander among fields of cherries, berries, melons), it's a grand melange, a masterful marriage of flavors. There's something uplifting here, something that sets my soul free, something that happens in few brews, and you know it when you feel it, and it's happening now! Something ancient exists in this, a collection of metaphysical passages through the centuries. It feels light at times, deep at others, citric for a stage, then a touch woody, even oaky, showing some malt, as if peeking through peepholes in a glimpse through time itself. 
If my remarks seem grandiose, forgive this foolish ale imbiber, for there's simply no better way to transmit the feelings this glorious brew delivers than to let imagination soar, and transplant the sensations into corresponding comments that may seem at times beyond the ordinary. So be it, for this beer is...I'm still drinking, it's still changing, tasting sweeter now, with a sharp candyish feel, still an underlying layer of tart. The tongue dances and darts, utterly delighted by the play it encounters from this frisky brew. 
Sweet, deep, dark, toffee-ish, completely original, a meal in a bottle, a dream trapped under a cork, ...

The flavor is a very well rounded and smooth mélange of dried fruit, sherry, caramel, and some hop oils.  I say rounded in the sense that there is nothing cutting that grabs you and makes you take note.  The thing I really notice about this one is just how smooth and coordinated it tastes.  The palate is also smooth, rounded, and coating, but not sticky.  Overall, this is a very well designed brew.  Thanks to Slikwily for this!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"

Sweet aroma of vanilla, rum, bubble gum, cherries, caramel malt, yeast, candy sugar, maple, flowers, and wet grass. Wow. Basically I can smell most things that I can think of here. Big malty flavor but less sweet than expected. Has some leathery bitterness and a turpentine fusel alcohol quality that reminds me of Orval. Freaking delicious though. Nice long finish.

2313,"2004-03-07",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 15, 2010 Cheers to you Matta for this succulent appetizer!Appearance is a murky brown, even more so when pouring the immense amount of yeast into the chalice (which helped a lot to release the subtleties of the awesome aroma). It seems paler than the regular abbaye des rocs. Relatively high apparent carbonation level, huge head with irregular bubbles, but quite spectacular. It slowly fades away, but still sticks to the glass. Aroma is very complex if not too intense. This is ultimate belgian goodness and balance between brown sugar malt sweetness and yeast funkiness. Ultra-complex fruity profile (berries, cherries, plums, pears, apples), very spicy also (sage, parsley, cinnamon cake). Thats all great by itself, but what makes the aroma truly unique is how it combines the above flavours with the belgian farmhouse character from the yeast which lends it a unique hay-ish and floral side that I love, almost a Fantome. The taste also contains this good dose of funk and spicy unexplainable weirdness, wet fieldish hay drying under the sun, pepper grains, basil, thyme? full of subtleties and perhaps the apotheosis of a spiced belgian strong dark ales with masterfully hidden alcohol, very sweet, bready and yeasty with a creamy, silky crème caramel medium-full body. Plain delicious and worthy of world-class status.  Lowering from 4.6 to 4.2. One of my favourite brown strong Belgian ales, but this is a style I enjoy far less than I used to.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

2313,"2004-01-17",4.2,"Cork Reads: 065/759976     ** I don’t know what the hell that means, batch #?
Exceptionally effervescent! Pours a large rocky camel colored head that sits atop a beautiful fizzy mahogany body, extreme sheets of lacing cover the sides of the glass. The nose is pungent with apples, plums, caramel, toffee, peach plum apricot, it’s ridiculous all the fruit I find in this brew! 
 The flavor has a slightly tart yeasty, balsamic vinegar quality, although it is overall sweet. Notes of molasses, dates, apple and apricot continue to stand out, although I also hit on some woodsy oak and cedar notes. Mentions of cigar; a Claro or Colorado Claro wrap are present. Very complex and fruity, a different yeasty quality than I am accustom to.
 The palate is quite sticky, not thin at all. The finish is certainly warming but pleasant as the sweetness shows, yet the 10% abv is well rounded.
 I should mention that I had this particular bottle aging for about 6 months and previous to that it was found dusty in a dark corner at a store. I would suspect that this beer has been bottled for a couple years now. But it was far superior to the Abbay des Rocs Amber Ale!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

Muddy, dark reddish-brown with very little head.  Lots of particles and a ""serious"" but appealing look.  Delicious aroma of spicy malt and candi sugar, hints of fruitiness-- dark cherry-- and caramel.  Initial taste is lightly sweet with bitterness of hops and spices.  Definitely a Belgian brown ale.  Nice, full body, very smooth texture with tingling, numbing bitterness spreading throughout the mouth.  Finish has a bitter, glowing bright hum with dark dirty malt and hops, as well as a tremendous, mouth-watering complexity.  Very smooth and long finish with a slight sweetness creeping in late on.

2313,"2003-12-31",4.8,"750 ml green bottle. Crowned & corked. 2003 batch. Poured out a murky, burnt orange color, with an enormous tan head. It slowly faded back to a thick mat of lace on top of the beer, and clung desperately to the sides of the glass. Yeasty islands appear as the head slowly slides back to reveal a wonderful aroma. Smells of fresh cut hay, bready yeast, lots of citrus happening here also. Aromas of candi sugar, corriander & other exotic Indian ocean spices as well. Lemon peel, orange zest, fresh squeezed grapefruits round out the citrus components of this nectar. Strong malts in the taste as well as a zingy hops bite. This has got to be one of the best Abbey beers I've ever had. Different character than Westvleteren Abt 12, but special in it's own way anyway. Words fail me as I sip & enjoy this truly exquisite finely crafted beer.
A great beer to end 2003 with, if I do say so myself.","","Cobra"
2313,"2003-12-28",4.8,"UPDATED: DEC 29, 2003 First rate pour of light brownish leather settling as a dark caramel brown with a slender reddish tone, dusky thick and opaque with tons of yeasties suspended within the murk. Head grows tall and fast of tannish fluff to a fine velvety smoothness becoming rocky and crusty as it begins to melt down which takes a good amount of time before finally a full haze on top and thickly fluffed collar sticks around the edge. Lacing is in sparitic globbuels. 

Aroma is appetizing and soft with spices; delicate and easeful with a sufficient showing of lemon tea cookies and lemon and orange zest with small notes of giniger and cinnamon. Has some notions of dark caramel surfacing from underneath on big wiffs plus some yeast, phenolic, and warm alcoholic notes. More of the yeast and phenols come through as it warms, big time.

Taste is very complex and incerdibly inticing. Whew, what a mouthfull of things going on here. Simply amazing and fine with nothing to overpowering really other then the alcohol hitting fast as it goes down very nicely with a smooth zesty fullness that begins to make your head swoon just after half a glass and there's yet a whole nother serving in that 750ml bottle yet to come, oh boy...a long night ahead. Flavors are quick to enter with sharpening tones of citrus zest from lemon and orange with some light pineapple, white grapes, dulled grapefruit, and sweet mango inscribed within the mix along with small added notes of yeasty spicyness with kinda of a peppery, clove, nutmeg, citrus peel zest thing. Lots of zest! Lots of softened spicyness. And what makes it even more remarkable is there seems to be a very nice dark malty sweetness of toffee/caramel that kinda keeps those spices from getting out of control and too strong. Beautiful medley of flavors that intermingle and dance with each other in perfect harmony. Full bodied feel with a bit of sharpness and yeastyness that takes away just a nudge for me, but not by much. So goes the feel so goes the drinkability, in most cases anyways, and it does with me with this, by just another nudge mainly due to the untraceable alcoholic effect this has and smallish sharp tone of zest and yeast.

2313,"2003-10-27",4.3,"Pours with a thick tannish head.  A beautiful deep garnet color with a slight chill haze to it.  This beer smells fruity (apricot being the most predominant aroma, followed by orange).  There is a certain candy sweet aroma as well, maybe a hint of butterscotch.  This beer has an outstanding aroma and I could just sniff it for ages.  As I sniff it the head has barely lost its 2 inch thickness, it is well carbonated.  There is a bit of maltiness in the aroma as well.  It is definitely well carbonated tasting as well.  It is lightly sweet, with a fruitiness that was promised in the nose.  There is both a candied apricot and orange flavor here.  There is also a slight sense of the alcohol in this one.  The taste doesn't quite live up to the aroma but this beer still need to warm up a bit.  I detect a hint of astringency in the finish, there seems to be some nice Belgian yeast fermentation byproducts here as well.  The beer has some slight Belgian lacing in evidence as I slowly work my way to the bottom of the glass.  As it warms up the beer becomes softer, though the alcohol is still evident.  Becomes sweeter and maltier.  the beer color clears up a bit as it warms too, it displays some nice orange hues as it is held up to the light.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

It poured a medium sized tan head that contained fine-small sized bubbles that was mostly diminishing. The body was carbonated, there was floating particles observed and the body was hazy with a copper hue. The nose was malty, caramel, sweet, and had various fruit notes to it. The flavor was a bit bitter, acidic, caramel, some alcohol notes, and a bit tart/tangy. The palate was smooth and light-medium bodied. This beer had excellent lacing to it.

Somewhat of an oak aged taste that is woody and nutty with hints of fruits like raisins and dates predominantly.  As it begins to warm, black and bing cherries start to surface, along with carmelized brown sugar followed by an almost coffee cake like essence.  A  creamy ring of froth and lacing around the edge like a cup of Jamaican Blue Mountain.

Heavily sweet flavor, moderately sweet and lightly bitter finish.  Medium body has a creamy texture and lively carbonation.  The carbonation doesn't interfere with the creaminess, amazingly.

Firt sip is fruity and yeasty, some sours collide with rich, ripe nectarine and pear.  Malty in the middle with that tangy cherry taste holding on.  Slightly hoppy and nutty at the end.

My god, it's a spot on match to one of the worst homebrews I ever concocted, a misguided attempt at making an English ""ordinary,"" with Fuggles as the sole hop variety used.

This gem pours the color of a fine cognac. The smallish sparkling head only partially destroys this illusion, as the immense, yeasty aromatics that are first released have an aged, oaky, brandish quality. Upon further inspection, there is a fruity, very malty predominance...yes, this is a beer.

Its a sweet nectar, with hints of Vernor's ginger ale (vanilla/ginger), dried fruits, and a twist of pepper. As it warms, I find English strong ale elements, due to the nearly cloying sugar and malt combo. And, there's enough hops in there to cleanse the palate between each sip and add an herbal touch.

Re-rate:  This beer is exceptional.  The silky smooth head retains very nicely.  Still tastes like chocolate covered oranges.  This is on another level.  It also tastes like a fruit cake in a way.  Cherries, nuts, bread, molasses.  This one has many many flavors.  It just doesnt quit.

ReRerate 050505:  Best before 2007:  Reminds me I have to get Vertical Epic today.  Its been a while since I had a good bottle of this.  I had a bad bottle recently from Mesa Liquor.  Ive had many bad bottles from there, so beware.  This bottle came from Holiday Wine cellar where they store their beer right.  Aroma is very distinct.  It has a alcohol, cherry, and sweet malt.  Too many complexities for me to describe.  I taste plum, date, chocolate, oranges, and as it warms, green apples.  Mouthfeel is awesome.  Head retention and lacing are excellent.  One of my favorites.","Fallbrook, California, USA","Kasteelfreak"
2313,"2003-01-13",4.5,"This one pours a clear, dark amber color with a big, off-white head. The head lingers for quite some time.

2313,"2002-12-23",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 3, 2003 This is the best belgian ale I've tried in a long time.  A moderate head that becomes a light lacing sits atop a dark ruby beer that looks quite inviting.  There is a cornucopia of fruit going on in the aroma, which makes the salivary glands work extra hard before you even sip.  There is so much going on in the flavor: cherries, raisins, caramel, honey...everything the commericial description claims and more.  And the finish, my oh my, chocolate covered cherries dance across the palate for a considerable amount of time.  For comparison, this is much like Trois Pistoles, but with more body, and a substantial malt charactaristic that is quite pleasant.  An outstanding beer!","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

Alcohol is a little evident at first but then disappears as soon as the sweet, fruity cherry and peach flavors merging with chocolate, yeast, caramel, honey and brandy take over.

The aroma: Heavily malty, moderately yeasty and just a hint of light perfume from the hops. Hints of fruits not yet discovered, cereal grain, and bread dough. Although the very high ABV is expertly hidden, it does work its way  through to the nose.
Appearance: A sparkling amber hue. The medium sized frothy head is khaki with very good lacing. Mostly lasting.
Flavor: Very malty. Slightly sweet & sour (chinese, anyone?). Curious spiciness. Once again, although the high ABV is well disquised, a warm, smooth alcohol flavor comes through.
Palate: Medium bodied. Lively carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. Long, dry finish with a lingering hint of clover.
Great, complex Belgian ale! Westy 8 might be the only Belgian ale that Ive enjoyed more at this point. Cant wait to try other beers from this brewery.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

Head is initially large, creamy, light brown, fully lasting. Body is hazy medium to dark amber, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (cookie, caramel, roasted nuts), lightly hoppy (flowers, apricot), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with light notes of toffee, plum, orange peel, raisin, candy sugar.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.

Medium body, watery/velvety/creamy texture, lively/soft carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.

9.5%, seriously???  Tastes like 6 or 7%...hardly any throat burn at all. Pleasant aroma, although just a tad subdued to garner an 8 (Id give a 7.5 if I could).  Similarly in the mouth its pretty mild.  If everything about it were just cranked up another notch it would be a 4+ brew.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2313,"2002-07-15",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 4, 2005 2002 bottleExtremely meaty, like going to a rain forest and having some papayas, guavas, oranges, passion fruit, malted barley (ok so thats not much of a rain forest item) and some roasted monkey meat with a really rich barbecue sauce.  This beer had a dark, almost purple-orange appearance. Wonderful body on this beer as well.On draught, 6/8/2005 at Redbones.  Pretty fantastic to see this stuff on draught here.  Man, my old reviews are bad.  Roasted monkey meat???  What?  Anyways, this was sweet, velvety and richly malted, with prunes, raisins, light chocolate and a hint of vinousness.  Yeast is strong and chewy.  Dry spicing on the end, seems to give some respite from the maltiness.  Low carbonation.  Aroma of nutmeg, caramelized sugar, earthy yeast, thick doughy malt and soft, cherries soaked in cointreau.  Dry Belgian chocolate as well.  Great stuff, perfect mouthfeel.  My sample seemed a tad bit loose on the end.On draught at Redbones, July 2005  Hazy brownish-raisin with some light tan notes and darker mahogany hues swirling about.  The head is small, but well-retained and a light, tan-oatmeal color.  Very fine bubbles rise in the glass, on the edges.  Aroma has delectable brown sugar, raisins, caramel and a beautiful yeast, characteristic of this brewery (I think thats the key to these guys success, their incredible trappist-like yeast).  The flavor brings forth succulent notes of dates, figs, raisins, toffee and brown sugar, with lightly tart fruitiness on the finish and a dry, almost wood-like note.  Alcohol is not present here and the body is big but fluffy.  Its decadent but its not, somehow.  Like falling back in to a plush, silk and down bed.  Yeast caresses the palate and sticks to the sides of the mouth, with light chocolate and more dry roastiness or woodiness.  Hints of vanilla and creme brulee on the end.  Tiny bubbles pack in the mouth and tickle the tongue.  The carbonation is low but scintillating.  Ah, what a wonderful beer.  Score is for this rating (I didnt have a clue what I was talking about in my previous review).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Spicey aftertaste like (melon) citron or something, lingering tart & hops flavor.  Theres a note of a vegetable-y taste/aftertaste in there -- like sprouts or pinto beans or something.
