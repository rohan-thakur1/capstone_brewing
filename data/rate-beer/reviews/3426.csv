3426,"2015-02-02",3.9,"375 ml bottle courtesy of my 2014 Reserve Membership. Assist via Mr. Nielsen. T. Hanks. Pours a darker and well hazed ominous hue, midnight hues shows purple and black, brownish with a touch of brownish berry glow on the edges. A frothy larger lighter brown head atop stays as a firm layer, good retention and lacing make this fairly appealing. Aromas throw lactic life, firmer yogurty and citric sourness meet pulpy and tart blackberry, yogurt and a bit of toastiness. Touches of biscuit, earth, firm sourness meets a bit of carmelized malts, gentle spice, subtle whiskey and tannic oak meet firmer lactic smack with a gentle funky kick. The blackberry is seedy, juicy, some good sour life cuts through that darker malt base with gentle funk, yogurt, firmer lactic sour twang. Initial is firmly sour, a bit lactic kickk up front is citric, yogurty and twangy. The blackberry, gentle dark fruit stabs in quickly. Seedy and pulpy fresh blackberry, thicket and tartness mix with some toastiness, caramel, a bit of biscuit. Gentle vanilla waft with firm sourness throughout, never getting harsh or acedic but more aggressive and enjoyable than Id expect from a darker sour. Firm lactic sourness, citric and biting, lemon and pulpy blackberry, seedy with some berry lemonade like life. A bit toasty, biscuity jab, subtle oak and whiskey flavors (not hot) into the backend fights its way through a bit, gentle spice, toast and funky yeast as it warms. However the sourness still proves the pace setter here, the dominant element that really offers some firm life on the palate. While the nose certainly fades a bit and shows more of the darker malt play beneath, the beer itself delivers some potent sourness, firm lactic life and a firm but not overdone blackberry addition. Fresh, seedy, nice funk and good lactic kick gives some good play. Finish is a bit yogurty, lactic and gentle toasty malt lingers on, a touch of vanilla, funk. More restrained oak influence compliments well from middle on without spirit or heat. Nice stuff overall with a more mellow nose, great pour and hues, head retention. Flavors and sourness work well for my palate. Tasty.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

3426,"2014-06-07",3.9,"Draft at the Source. Pours a dark black color with a very thin tan head. Strong, blackberry presence and yeast. Nice, blackberry taste with a sour finish. Once again a great sour from Crookef Stave.","Newport Beach, California, USA","haddon90"
3426,"2014-04-09",3.9,"UPDATED: SEP 22, 2015 On tap at Hops & Pie. Deep, dark red appearance with a fully diminishing head. Aroma of blackberries, dark fruit, funky yeast, light oak and a touch of vanilla. Similar flavor, fruity, tart and mildly sour. Nicely done.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
3426,"2014-03-05",4.3,"375 bottle shared with Rob. Has a nice purple tinted body with a small, light white head that fades quickly. The blackberry and cherry jam aroma are right up front with a sweetness you can really breath in. Flavors are fruit forward (dark berries and brett, with some lactic, earthy funk notes) -then finishes less sweet than I anticipated with more plum, raisin and soft tartness instead on the back end. The perfect amount of sour. Nicely fruited and less carbonated than Raspberry DO. Quite nice stuff...a must try. Another winner from Chad and the crew....","Denver, Colorado, USA","Doodler"
