964,"2016-06-19",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
A complex interplay of cereals, esters (bananas, pears), phenols and herbal hops is taken into earthiness and subtle bitterness.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sizeable head of foam tops the misty straw gold.
-Drinkability is relatively high.
-The nose has a lot going on.
-The yeast character behaves in a unique fashion in the presence of this grain bill. This brew might even have terroir. It doesnt recall anything I know, flavor and aroma-wise.

There is a nice lemongrassiness to this that is really good. It keeps me interested. The traditional maltiness and spice of a Belgian are there, but the lemongrass keeps it interesting.

964,"2016-05-24",3.8,"Bottled 3/24/16 and drunk 5/12/16 and again 5/22/16.Lovely copper appearance shows good clarity, as would be expected. Lighter golden and deeper amber tints are visible, with a big, off-white head atop showing strong retention.Lush, estery nose provides all sorts of various fruits; apple, pear, strawberry and so forth. Theres a deep cereal/grain character that is both clean and wonderfully well-developed. Wheat bread, biscuit, very light raisin and notes of that nature, mix with the esters pretty harmoniously adding a more earthy character to the light fruits. Not hugely phenolic, but with herbal/peppery hops to that end, which are reserved but still aromatic, leading to an earthy, lightly herbal finish replete with hints of floral notes. No alcohol noted.At first I dont notice it, but as Chris points out, this is actually fairly bitter in flavor. Certainly not overly so, but its a good complement to all of the malty notes, which provide only light to moderate sweetness, being well-attenuated. Herbs, floral notes and more earthy/grainy malts on the end, with ample, tight carbonation and a medium-soft, malty-to-grainy texture overall with no alcohol or flaw. More citrus character emerging as it warms and breathes, but I dont think it ever runs rampant and keeps the beer crisp and refreshing in the face of all of the malt/wheat/oat character.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

This was poured into a tulip. 
The appearance was a hazy burnt orange color with a slim bar pours kind of white head. Moderate rimmed/ringy lacing clings to the glass. 
The smell had some sweet Belgian sugars up front. Light lemon - semi-sweet, some orange peel, light spice - coriander.
The taste was sweet backed up nicely by the coriander. Slight Belgian sweet malty aftertaste. Quick semi-sweet to dry finish. 
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a nice sipping quality about it. Carbonation felt light allowing some stickiness but nothing overbearing. 
Overall, really nice Belgian Strong pale ale. Id have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
