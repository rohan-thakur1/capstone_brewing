Hazy dark brown with light tanned head. Aroma is dark fruits, alcohol, marzipan. Taste is licorice, dark fruits, alcohol. I always preferred Pannepeut more than Pannepot and I think its the same with the reserva. Not my favorite Struise but again a very good one.","BELGIUM","Bierridder_S"

2345,"2015-03-08",4.2,"Draft sample @ ACBF 2015. 
Ambrée, col beige, doré au verre. Malté gardant cette approche très belge et un profil Struise. Sucré moyen avec cette impression de sous-bois, feuillu. Pointe dépice et fine note de levure. Une version solide mais un cran en dessous de loriginale. Lajout et murissage en fut de Bourbon confère à cette bière une autre dimension qui se marie parfaitement au caractère très belge de cette bière notamment dans lusage des malts et du sucre candis.. Cest par ailleurs une sorte de hit or miss avec le programme de barrique de Struise, dans ce dernier cas, la bière est une réussite.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
