2958,"2015-09-15",3.5,"Sample at the brewpub during the Bottle Release on 08/28/2015. The beer pours a clear golden color with a medium white head that burns away steadily to a wispy film. Spotty lacing. Aroma of malt, caramel and fruit. Medium body with flavors of caramel malt, corn and fruit. The finish is sweet with a grainy malt aftertaste. Decent overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

2958,"2015-09-06",2.5,"Growler share thanks to Homer321. Sweet, malty, aroma with some butter character. Slightly hazy, darker yellow. More sweet, malty, corny, light buttery character, slick mouthfeel.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","DrewFace"
2958,"2015-09-02",3.7,"Peter killing it with the courtesy toss. Quart bootle close enough to a 40 for a florida homer I suppose. Pours gold like all beer and even has a small white head. Very light bubbles for the style. Clean though. Vibrant lemon/lime components with muted honey and cereal...just a touch bready. Just a touch. Minimal perceived bitterness with prickly tight carbonation. Im not going to act like this isnt a touch sweet. I even have some coconut creeping in as this goes on. Orange rind. Pipe tobacco. Vanilla and graham cracker round out in the finish. Slick, easy to drink, and quite tasty. this is pretty darn good.","@ $13.99, Iowa, USA","DietPepsican"
2958,"2015-09-01",3.5,"Draft at the Public House. Pours a clear, pale bright gold with a white head that settles small and uneven and lasts for quite some time. Pretty sweet, but without any boozy forwardness, and surprisingly balanced. Notes of cereal, pale, and bready malts, straw, sugars, and a hint of muddled fruit. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a smooth, sweet mouthfeel. Totally lacks harshness, which is neate. The ABV is sneaky here, big time. DrSilverworm and I talked about pricing for this one, and what would make sense for a 40 oz. package. Kind of a fun thought. We thought $6-$7 would be about right. Bums wouldnt buy it and college bros wouldnt, either, but true malt liquor aficionados would.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2958,"2015-08-30",3.4,"Poured into a sampler glass on draft. Beautiful clear gold amber with small head. Aroma is caramel malts, corn and butter, with silage grains. Tastes like caramel toffee, corn and butter, and some booze. Thick mouth, big booze flavor. But not really my cup of tea...ehh or beer.","Boca Raton, Florida, USA","Fritz123"
2958,"2015-08-30",3.6,"5oz on tap at Jackie-Os. Some corn, and that classic strong adjunct lager malt liquor mildly fruity funk character... But without the bite! No harshness nor roughness. Hides the alcohol pretty well. Drinks like 7% to me. Only thing giving it away is the slightly bigger body. Medium to bigger body, smooth, kind of crisp, lighter carbonation. Moderate-plus sweet taste, light bitter. Surprisingly mild alcohol. Clear golden color. Ring of white head. Loose bits of lace. Pretty impressive, tasty malt liquour. I really could drink this all day. $6-7 for a 40oz would be cool to see...","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
2958,"2015-08-28",3.4,"Draft to 5 oz taster at Jackie os. Pours a clear golden color with a small off white head. The aroma and flavor have sweet malts, sweet corn, caramel, a hint of booze that some of the bigger beers didnt have, some fruity notes come through, mild bitterness to the finish, better than most malt liquors, but....","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
2958,"2015-08-22",3.2,"Draft pour at the source. The beer is a clear gold with a white head of foam. The aroma is sweet and corny and has some white rice character to it. There is a hint at some bitterness in here as well, bit it has big competition with the boozy heat to even try to come through. Bigger body and medium carbonation. Not bad, really. I would want a binch of this though.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
2958,"2015-08-05",3.3,"Pint at the brewpub on 8/3/15. Clear gold pour with a medium white head. Aroma of sweet malt, light caramel and fruit. Sweet malt and light berry flavor before a sweet finish.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
