1289,"2017-02-02",3.3,"Voici une étude archéologique de chez Brussels Beer Project. Brasser un bière à partir de pain est une idée originale, reprenant le temps où les pains dorge étaient émiettés, mouillés pour être laissés fermenter pendant plusieurs jours avant que la pâte obtenue soit pétrie et égouttée pour obtenir du zythum ou curmi. Mais au final, lajout de pain ne laisse pas ressortir de caractéristique réellement atypique et il en ressort une bière plutôt agréable jouant principalement sur lamertume. De robe, cette Babylone est ambrée (utilisation de malt cara 90, 160 notamment), partiellement voilée (EBC de 38) et surmontée dune mousse blanc cassé crémeuse dun centimètre et demi. Le nez se porte principalement sur le pamplemousse, le fruit de la passion et le résineux. On se rapproche grandement de certaines IPA. Lattaque, souple, se porte essentiellement sur le malt avec des arômes prépondérants de caramel suivis de notes de fruits de la passion et de poivre.La deuxième bouche est de façon surprenant neutre et douce avec une arrière bouche sur le malt cara. Est ce là lexpression du pain? Cest possible mais on est alors heureux de larrivée de lamertume sur une belle intensité (IBU de 55) qui se pare darôme de résineux avec lutilisation dun triptyque East Kent Glodings, Crystal et Chinook. En parallèle larrière bouche gagne en profondeur sur des arômes de caramel mais également de tabac blond. Le final dune bonne longueur, gagnera en amertume, franche, mais qui en devient trop amère en fin de bouche, déstabilisant lensemble (utilisation dun houblonnage à cru pour le Chinook). Les 7 % Abv sont quant à eux plutôt bien utilisés. En conclusion même si cette Babylone est plutôt agréable, elle fait preuve de trop dhétérogénéité et finalement doriginalité même.","FRANCE","jybi"

I like the idea of brewing a beer with bread a lot and therefore was excited to taste it, also because so far, Ive never tasted a Kvass or other bread-fermented drinks. This beer is quite a nice Bitter, although at the verge of being overly sweet. Lots of sweet orange and caramel malts in taste, nice bready baseline. Didnt like its smell, however: a sweet dankness, with cooked citrus peel and a touch of old bergamotte oil gave me bad associations of old wet flowers. Could also be loads of Chinook hop oils.

1289,"2015-10-23",3.8,"One of BBPs staple beers, apparently made with fermented bread and three less common hop varieties (at least in Belgium).  Light gushing but nothing unmanageable. Fairly thick and dense, moussy, light greyish white, stable head over a lightly hazy, deep warm amber coloured beer with strong fizz and tiny yeast bits divided over the liquid. Aroma of dried orange peel, roasted chestnuts, pine resin, field flowers, dates, white pepper, some fermenting peach, freshly baked brown bread, fried mushrooms with brown sugar, black tea, cake, earth, some FFF (freshly fermented farmland). Dried fruits in the onset, hints of blueberries, pear and pineapple but rather restrained, with spicy hop bitterness immediately apparent - surprisingly early in the palate, usually an omen of much more hops to come. Smooth bready and nutty malts in the middle, sufficient body, and indeed the hoppiness goes into overdrive quickly, reaching its zenith in the finish, where it dries mouth and throat alike with a strong, peppery, leafy, crispy, resinous, herbal bitterness lasting for a long time and providing hayish and floral retronasal effects, but most of all a strong pine effect typical for Chinook.  A resinous coating of bitterness lasts after the final sip.  If ESB was the intention (though this is not mentioned on the label!), then this is acceptable to me: it has some of the looks, dryness, crispness and mild, restrained fruitiness of indeed Fullers ESB and its congeners, though the hop bitterness is clearly far above average even for the style - unambiguously pointing in the direction of IPA - and there clearly are some wild estery fermentation aromas I would associate with Belgian ale rather than English ale. Regardless of style, this is another of BBPs interesting additions to the Belgian beer landscape, showcasing the three hop varieties used.  As for the Mesopotamian connection: nobody knows precisely what those beers tasted like and hops werent even used yet at the time.  Merely a general, symbolical tribute to the origins of beer, if you will - goes well with a prayer to Ninkasi, perhaps, but other than that, this has little to do with the beers from Antiquity, I think.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

This beer is named after Babylon due to the fact part of the mash is replaced with bread just like in the Ancient Middle East where these earliest beers were drunk through a straw. This unusual mash is combined with US hops giving this deep reddish-orange beer a hugely resinous & citrusy aroma. Sharply carbonated on a med-light body with a dry finish that puts it squarely into IPA territory. The taste is quite interesting you get a nutty caramel toasted biscuits sweetness from the bread and a big brash pine & citrus rind from the hops. Very cool stuff. For hop heads but with a historical twist.

1289,"2015-04-09",3.1,"Bottle @ home. Aroma is fruity and floral hops, light malty note, hint of caramel and liquorice. Flavour is bitter, with liquorice, burned caramel andbready notes. Could use more flavour from hops, but I like the idea.","Den Haag, NETHERLANDS","dEnk"
1289,"2015-04-05",3.6,"Word of caution, there seems to be two batches going about. One labeled bread bitter and one ale bitter which seems to be a bad batch which the good folks at BBP still thought would be wise to put on the market. Luckily, I landed a good version. Bouteille 33cl de Malt Attacks, BB 04/03/2017.
De couleur ambrée, sur un léger trouble, col épais crémeux beige.
Arôme au bouquet prenant de grains concassés, notamment dune fini pain/bready dough assez plaisant. Le tout est ponctué par un houblonné tout aussi agréable et qui procure des effluves de pin avec un ajout plus noble des EKG.
Palais au profil tirant sur les houblons avec un agréable citronné caractéristique de lEKG et du Chinook pour les notes de pin/résineux et un léger fruité agrumes de pamplemousse. Ces dernières se prêtent subtilement bien au caractère épais de la bière dont le côté grains est bien présent et le renforcé de malt apporte une certaine prestance du pain ainsi quune note caramel/grillée. 

Au niveau du style, on penche plus sur une sorte dhybride IPA belge que sur une bitter. Dailleurs cette appellation de bread bitter ne veut rien dire dans létat actuel de cette bière qui na danglais que le houblon EKG.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
1289,"2015-04-02",2.3,"Pours a slightly cloudy, brown beer and a medium, fine beige head.
Smells hoppy, malty.
Tastes bitter.
Leaves a malty and hop bitter palate.
Mouth feel is big, the alcohol is subtle.
Not my favorite.","Oostakker, BELGIUM","domienS"

1289,"2015-03-24",3.6,"Ambrée foncée, effervescence faible, col blanc cassé de bonne tenue. Plutôt maltée rôtie en entrée mais les houblons simposent ensuite assez rapidement pour donner une amertume florale, légèrement épicée et pour le moins persistante.","Brussels, BELGIUM","EddyBeer1"
1289,"2015-03-20",3.5,"Clear deep amber-copper colour with a smooth off white head and good lacings. On the nose aromas of spruce/pine and toast is predominant, yet subtle notes of earthyness, floral-hay notes arise. Somewhat effervescent with a spicy touch, lightly slick texture and a medium-full body. A light fruity sweetness builds into a well pronounced cereal-malt body which develops and brings out a solid toast like bitterness supported by its hops. Long lasting finish. Harmonic and interesting concept! Good stuff.","LUXEMBOURG","McWorta"
