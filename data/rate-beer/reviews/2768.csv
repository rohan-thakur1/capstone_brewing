2768,"2012-03-07",4.1,"Draught at the brewpub in Autumn, 2009: Apricot with a golden sheen. Staggering nose of pound cake, nuts, toasted straw, fresh bread, biscuity malt and an appetizing whiff of peppery and grassy hops. Firm and snug carbonation. Remarkably clean and rich with an utterly  divine display of malt purity ranging from sweet bread and pound cake to cookie and nuts. Staunch mineralic clasp magnifies the already amazingly polished nature. Hops flourish in the background as the profoundly intricate malt medley continues to elegantly grace the palate. Minerals continually scrub the tongue while the resoundingly deep pillow-soft malt glides over with a sublimely textured dextrinous caress. Dab of kettle caramelization gorgeously bolsters the already sturdy bready malt core.  Closes malt-driven with a dazzling  array of cookie and biscuit alongside echoes of hay and characterful yeast.  The water quality here is truly divine, and this is easily some of the cleanest malt Ive ever encountered. Exemplary balance, to boot. A very special Vienna lager.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
2768,"2009-10-19",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 13, 2013 draft at the Svaty Florian in Loket.  caramel brown and clear with a dense, long-lasting, fine-bubbled off-white head.  rich and aromatic munich-type maltiness with a bounty of freshly toasted bread, biscuits, sweet toffee and caramel and nutty accents of almond and amaretto. dense, frothy and full carbonation with amazingly malt heft. touches of spices and dried gras noble hops and a distinct apple cake finish make this one dance.  superbly soft and creamy malt throughout. just lovely.  four years later and this remains the best polotmavy Ive ever had.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
2768,"2009-08-12",2.6,"Draft at the brewpub. A hazy amber beer with a lazing off-white head. The aroma has notes of butter, malt, and straw. The flavor is sweet with notes of butter, malt, caramel, and straw, leading to a dry straw finish. The body is light.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
2768,"2009-08-10",3.4,"Draught at the brewpub. A cloudy amber with a foamy off-white head. A sweet biscuity malt nose. A good bittersweet palate, well balanced between the malt and citrus hops.","Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","TheGrandMaster"

2768,"2008-04-07",3.7,"Back from a Czech Republic pub-crawl this is part of my express ratings for the typical Světlý 11°- (Czech light Pils), Světlý 12°+ (Czech Pils), Polotmavý (Czech Amber Lagers) and Tmavý (Czech Black Lagers).  Non-typical beers will receive personalized descriptions after the express ratings.-------- />
How: Tap at brewpub (Minipivovar Loket, Loket, Czech Republic)
The look: Dark amber body with a large creamy beige head
To me a typical Czech Polotmavé (Czech Amber Lagers) is: Hay and biscuit wrapped in caramel.  Very light fruity notes with no specific fruits giving the impression of slightly fruity caramel.  Moderately sweet.  Sweetness is well balanced by dry grassy hops.  Body is smooth.  Medium carbonation.
This one: As above but a bit more roasted and more dry grassy hops than average.  A superior Polotmavé.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
2768,"2008-04-07",3.7,"En fût. Pinte dégustée directement à la brasserie. Arôme: Odeur de caramel avec une très légère pointe de vinaigre balsamique. Apparance: La couleur est ambrée foncée voilée. Présence dun moyen col mousseux et dune fine dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Goût de céréale et de caramel avec une pointe dhoublon. Longue durée de larrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture légèrement onctueuse. Faible effervescence en bouche. Présence de caramel en arrière goût. (Rating #1567)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","TaktikMTL"
2768,"2008-03-24",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Delicate caramel maltiness envelops the herbal, grassy hops of this full-bodied yet quenching Polotmavé Lezak.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-The usual mountain of foam rises atop the hazy dark amber.
-The malt and hop tandem build lightly earthy notes.
-The aroma ably announces what is to come in the flavor profile.
-A marvelous equilibrium reigns throughout; all flavors work as one.

2768,"2007-03-01",3.4,"on tap at the hotel ferdinand in loket. the only beer they seemed to have and we were the only customers they seemed to have. quite a healthy shade of amber with a light haze suggesting it was unfiltered. loads of lacing from the everlasting head. nutshell aroma with traces of caramel. reasonably sweet and toffeed with some roasted hay character and a lightly bitter finish. not exactly mind-blowing but a pretty good afternoon beer to have only a block or 2 from the amazing loket castle","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
