4473,"2017-03-16",3.9,"Light brown colour. Viscous. No head, obviously, after a couple rounds of freezing. Aroma is sort of a maple-soy glaze situation, but also with some deep oxidation and a light alcohol sting. Soft, sweet, the saltier soy sauce accent isnt great here, but the woody character and richer sugars (maple syrup, toffee)...a deep rich stewed fruitiness as well, with alcohol/brandy notes. This is a tasty, rich eisbock.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
4473,"2017-03-04",4.1,"From a micro growler (thx, Alex!). Pours a dark brown with no head. Aroma is damn complex with woody, dark cherry, oak, bourbon, chocolate, and liquorice notes. Very boozy. Almost zero carbonation. Taste is woody, very sweet, moderately sour, dark fruits, port notes, some chocolate. Quite harsh, though. Very interesting stuff, looooong seeeeeeeeeper, hehe.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","beerplace"

4473,"2016-02-20",3.8,"Bottle share from Jeremy. Strongest beer Ive had yet. Cant get past the alcohol, but there is good taste and body on this, once you get past the ABV. And as proven, it will flame ....","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"

4473,"2015-12-31",4.1,"Bottle. Dark brown pour with no head. Aroma is caramel, bread, dark fruit, a subtle tartness. Taste is subtly tart and sour, some nice caramel, bread and dark fruit, complex and delicious. One of the best beers I've tried with crazy high ABV.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","ljthiessen"
4473,"2015-12-29",3.6,"Massive beast of a beer, as could be expected. Tangy citrus and caramel. Amber pour. Sweet and boozy finish. Tap at brewery.","Washington D.C., Washington DC, USA","solidfunk"
4473,"2015-12-11",3.8,"Draft - Dark, syrupy and almost medicinal. Clear dark brown. Sweet, dark, touch of ammonia and medicinal notes that coat the throat. Like so many of these beers a sticky liqueur.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
4473,"2015-12-08",4.2,"On tap at Storm, pours a deep dark mahogany with essentially no head. Aroma is rich as hell, with loads of brandy and sherry like liqueur, with dark fruits, a touch of and alcohol - though doesnt actually burnt that much at all. Flavour is supremely complex, with notes of liqueur, dark fruits, a little caramel and then comes the massive alcohol burn. Wouldnt have guessed this was a Flanders Red at the base, as there is no sourness. While it burns, its still rather drinkable for what it is. The sweetness is moderate and partly masked by the heat. Complex as hell and a delight to sip. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
4473,"2015-12-06",4.1,"From the breweryDark chestnut color, it has a minimal carbonation, not enough to produce any head. The aroma is strong, at first it reminds of English Barley Wines, such as the Thomas Hardys Ale, later it has notes of raisins and nuts, and alcohol. Full bodied, sweet, and immediately boozy; nice malt flavor, some caramel, and a strong concentrate berry juice too; it doesnt have the Parmigiano Reggiano negative feeling of other iced beers, but it ends with a mild dusty note; the oak barrel is not evident.A bit expensive (40$ for half litre), but undoubtedly very interesting; and rather pleasant as sipper.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
