2852,"2017-05-27",4.5,"I bought this back in 2005 from The Belgian Shop.

This pours from 12oz bottle( stamped date of 07 06 08) a deep brown that you just cant see through, ok, Ill say murky. The head takes up about 20% of my New Belgium goblet and is an off white and is thick and billowy that I imagine myself being able to a take a bite out of it and it would be chewy. Also, theres a few sprinkles on the top of the head from the sediment.

The smell has a realy dark fruity nose to it, raisin-prine-plum-fig, along with some chocolate, yeast, coffee, and yeah, a bit of the alcohol.

The taste on first sip has the dark fruits at center stage. Subtly sweet portions of plum, raisin, fig, some dark cherry, a touch of chocolate and cofee(and I do mean just a touch) and a slight bitterness in the form of some citrus near the tail end of the sip and it carries on right through the finish where I also get some of the alcohol that warms the throat during the swallow. This is so darn complex that I fear my words will not do it justice but hey, Im doing the best I can. ;^)

Ok, Im about 2/3rds of the way through my glass and the chocolate is a bit more pronounced now and that simply adds to how silky smooth the mouthfeel is. And look at all that sticky lacing on the sides of my glass!

This is the second of my bottles Ive tasted(the last one was shortly after I received them) and Im as impressed now as I was then....a 2 year span. 

Bottom line: Yeah, I spent a few bucks to get my bottles of Westvletern 12(and 8) and I could have bought lots of other beers for the cost but, I feel that the money was spent well. Ive had other quadrupels before and I liked them. Im partial to the style. Is this the best example of the style that Ive had to date? You darn tootin. Is it because of the scarcity factor? No. Its because my palate tells me that it is *that* damn good. Complexity in the taste? This has it. Complexity that has all the flavours working in harmony? This has it. A great looking appearance in a glass? This has it. A nose that keeps you sniffing before every sip? This has it. A mouthfeel that is both silky smooth and chewy at the same time? This comes very close. Drinkability that goes through the roof? Just about. So, would I buy some again? At current prices?(US$18 per bottle plus shipping from Belgium) Maybe, but if it was as ""easily"" available as other examples of the style, Id buy it by the case.","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"

Im looking forward to searching some more out on my visit next month. I might even take a trip to the abbey if possible.","Mesa, Arizona, USA","AZBierLover"

Pours very dark with a thick, stable light-beige top.
Aroma is splendid! It feels like it almost fills up my entire room with christmas spices, nuts, honey, chocolate, rasins, dried fruits and yeast. Aroma has also a hint of freshly baked dark bread in it.
Taste is vey complex, the first sip felt really intense with yeast, alchol, bread, caramel and malt. Then the taste starts to build and change and turns into an explosion if different ejoyable tastes - honey, roasted bread, honey, beeswax, pepper, cardamum... It is hard to describe, one just has to taste it. It feels really smooth and velvety actually.
It is funny as I felt alcohol in the first sip but later the taste of alcohol is almost completely gone - it is really well masked, it feels almost like a light beer.
Aftertaste has almost everything nice in it, also a hint of hoppy bitterness. And I can feel very nice alcoholic warmth in the back of my throat and in my stomach.

Color marrón oscuro, casi negro, opaco, con reflejos rojizos, y capa de espuma de un blanco amarronado de dos dedos de grosor (retención decente, burbujas amplias). Bastante cuerpo. Carbonatación media y visualmente preciosa (tres o cuatro cascadas de burbujas en sentido inverso). El aroma no me interesa lo más mínimo (frutal, caramelo, un toque de alcohol estilo perfume). Textura algo efervescente en boca. El sabor es predominantemente dulce (en boca), con presencia de frutas y caramelo. Final amargo que mejora el conjunto y buena dosis alcohólica final (calienta mucho la garganta, sobre todo en los primeros tragos, pero no es un alcohol que moleste o esté excesivamente presente).

Whilst the rumours that the bernardus recipe is identical to this beer may be true, the fact is that there is definitely something different in the process. For starters, they look different. The bernardus has patchy tan head whereas the westy has pillowy white head. The bernardus has more spice on the nose whereas the westy has exactly what you expect from the westmalle yeast; caramel, dark fruits, raisins, clove and a hint of banana. This is noticeably more balanced than the bernardus. Very easy drinking. Certainly one of the best beers in the world. However, try it side by side with the rochefort 10 and there is no comparison. Rochefort has a better aroma and flavour. This is deservedly known as one of the best quads in the world, but Rochefort is noticeably better in my personal opinion.

W barwie, czarne z ciemnobrązowymi refleksami, nieprzejrzyste acz klarowne 
Zapach tworzą nuty szlachetnego alkoholu i ciemnych owoców: daktyle, ciemnie winogrona 
Smak jest wielowymiarowy i złożony, niemniej zbalansowany: daktyle, rodzynki, figi, przypieczony karmel, winogrona, nuta szlachetnego alkoholu, porto. Jest tego naprawdę dużo. Średnia wytrawność, goryczka raczej niska, alkohol (10,2% ABV) wyczuwalna tylko w przełyku, przyjemna. Wysycenie niskie (co jak na piwo Belgijskie powinno dziwić), jednak robi to dobrze temu piwu - odczucie w ustach jest silniejsze i klarowniejsze.
Czy najlepsze piwo na świecie? Ciężko powiedzieć, z pewnością jednak najlepsze piwo trapistów i jedno z lepszych belgijskich albo nawet i na świecie.

Im sure I can just copy and paste what I had for the Bernardus Abt 12 in here, with minor modifications that probably have to do much more with the momentum, temperature, age of bottle, than with a true difference between these beers. Perhaps the greatest difference is the more pungent aroma of alcohol in this one, while the Bernardus seemed to be mellower. This is a reasonably fresh one, maximum 6 months old. This dark amber beer has those fruits in the cellar holding the main backbone of the aroma and taste. Alcohol on the aroma to start with, stronger, with freshly tanned leather and an explosion of apples, plums, peaches and apricots, old books and wooden crates, wicker baskets and dusty curtains, dark empty wine bottles and firewood, both on the aroma and flavours. Its all so round and timeless, with sweet malts, vanilla and yeastroasted almondswine pruneshoney, tobacco leaves  wow!

My take it on it is this: its a really, really, good Belgian strong ale. If youre a serious IPA drinker, calling this the best beer in the world would be like trying to explain to a classical music aficionado why Kanye West deserved a Grammy. For me, I thought it had an amazing apple-ness to it, enough toast/bread notes to subdue the sweetness, and a bit of an alcohol edge. Its extremely flavorful and it sticks around, laces the glass, and all those things youd want to see in a great beer. Best Ive ever had? Unsure. Worth hunting for the taste? Sure, why not.

Cherry and strong roasted caramel notes are present, and so is something sweeter, maybe fig, and peanut butter too!

2852,"2016-08-02",4.5,"4500th review! 330 ml bottle into chalice, bottled on 4/20/2014. Pours clear deep ruby red/brownish color with a 1 finger dense khaki head with great retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, light red grape, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, light leather, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with awesome complexity and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, light red grape, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, light leather, and yeast/toasted earthiness. Moderate peppery yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, cherry, fig, date, apple, peppercorn, brown sugar, brown bread, toasted biscuit, nuttiness, herbal, tobacco, and yeast/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible compelxity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/spiciness balance, and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from yeast spiciness as well. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, fairly creamy/bready, and lightly crisp/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is amazing. Alcohol is very well hidden with a only a light warmth present after the finish. Overall this is an insane quadrupel style. All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. Very similar to Abt 12; but this one had more nutty/biscuity malt complexity and a better mouthfeel. A highly amazing offering all around, as I had hoped for.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

To be absolutely honest here, Ive had this beer exactly 3 times, and the last time I took notes and rated it was September of 2014... Ive had a hell of a damn year and a half, so this seems like a lifetime ago, but hey... lets finally enter the damn rating. 



The beer pours a hazy dark brown with a good big head and nice lacing on the glass.

The aroma is all manor of plum and brown sugar with some light spice, some booze, a good healthy nuttiness, a teensy bit of roastiness and some light pear. 

The flavor is enjoyably spicy with some well managed booziness and a bit of grape character. Yeah it got the cool pear on plum thing with the mild nuttiness, which is really where its @ with Quad. Its got light chocolate, and a particular je ne sais quoin that even a skeptic (like myself) cannot deny. 
It is a great beer that Ive put too much of a fuss over in the past, in fact its about #3 for me from the 3 beers Ive had from this particular brewery, but yes, its essentially ""worth the fuss""","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

10.2%ABV. Abt/Quadrupel. 

Poured out of the bottle a dark amber brown, 28ºSRM.

Nose has berries and cherries. Pleasant rich alcoholic sweetness of rum raisins. Faint yeasty aroma with formic tartness on the nose. Subtle spice like cinnamon.

Mouthfeel is alcoholic and syrupy. There is adequate carbonation which is balances out the palate very nicely. Palate is ponderous with dark roasty flavors up front: espresso, dark chocolate, almost burnt barley toast, there is just enough breadth in the palate for an umami component to suggest burnt char siew ends. The middle of the palate is nicely rounded and endowed with fruity flavors: ripe dark cherries, honey plums, dates, prunes and stewed fruit. Because of the residual from the front of the palate, you get the impression of cherry liqueur dark chocolate candies. The palate is surprisingly light riding on a whisky smoky, alcoholic palate. No cloying sweetness. All the carbs in this this have been turned to beautiful aromatic alcohol.

Finish is clean without the expected cloy. 

Overall impression. Dangerously approachable. Quickly kicks you in the ass.

2852,"2016-01-22",4.6,"0,33lt bottle @ Valentin - Curious Bierkniepe, Volos, Greece
Very nice quadrupel, but the hype is more than the beer itself - maybe the difficulties to get this beer help to that a lot.
Anyway, it IS very good - complex, deep, with long aftertaste. I think though similar to the Rochefort 10, just with a fuller body, it;s more thick. The foam will last not long, the smell is like a wine, sweet malt and a bit alcohol. The taste has also the great malt as well some bitterness (had an aged one too, there you get less carbonation and more, deeper sweetness, very nice). Aftertaste is long. Better at about 15 degrees Celsius.

2852,"2016-01-16",2.4,"Because of the standing of this beer, I was expecting something great or at least really good. But as with most top 10 or top 50 RB beers, this was simply another let down after tasting more than 4500 other beers, I know there are so many other great tasting beers out there that Im not sure how this gets to the top of the list, perhaps the difficulty in acquiring it comes into play? I am finally beginning to realize that I must not like really good beer, go figger. From a bottle this beer poured a darker brew but not real dark, more of a lighter brown. Had a decent head that faded rapidly to a thin creamy foam which provided nice lacing. Initial taste impression was strong yet smooth and somewhat civilized and this is nothing out of the ordinary for many lower rated beers. Warming sensations as it transversed my mouth to the gullet. Some unexpected bitterness in the session, I thought it could have a few more manners. However, for 10% it did not provide an alky impact that was in yer face, tho it certainly was apparent and somewhat volatile on the olfactory -I guess that was a good thing. Flavors were simply alky laced old country trappest beer, nothing more. Decent co2, but not half the effect of a good Orval. The finish was the kind of feeling that you get when you drink a medium good trippel or even a misbehaved dubbel. So, overall, another letdown. I waited 10 years to try this and the build up to this nights tasting was not worth it but I was finally glad to get this off my bucket list. If you want a good quad experience, Sierra Nevada Ovila Quad is much better than this brew, JMHO. Quite a letdown.

2852,"2016-01-13",4.3,"Uno al afrontar esta cerveza, debe dejar atrás todas las expectativas que trae. Que sea calificada como muchos como la mejor cerveza del mundo juega en su contra, y puede que en la de quien la pruebe, aguándole un poco la experiencia. Es una cerveza que basa su mito en la poca disponibilidad y en su precio derivado de ello, acompañado de la calidad y delicadeza y complejidad de una Trappense. ¿Si es la mejor Trappense? es muy posible, para gustos colores. Para mi la Westmalle dubbel sería la Trappense que le recomendaría a un amigo por la relación calidad precio.
En definitiva, la Westvleteren XII se diferencia poco en calidad a sus hermanas Trappenses (como Rochefort o Westmalle), aunque seguramente se trate de la mejor de ellas, según mi opinión personal, pero el mayor esfuerzo para adquirirla, no compensará al bebedor normal.
En cuanto a sus notas de cata, sorprende su gran equilibrio de sabores, no destacando ninguna por encima de las demás. Su característico dulzor, en ningún momento llega a empalagar, y pese a su alta graduación no se nota ningún regusto alcohólico.","Santiago de Compostela, SPAIN","ferrinche"

Pours a very murky, dirty brown color. Head is tan and 1/4th of an inch. Sediment is very evident throughout tasting. Head retention and lacing were above average. 

Smell is big on dried and candied fruits, dates, figs, even some apricot. Belgian rock candy is also very present. Slight soy sauce is there, hops are not, and alcohol is definitely there.

Taste is heavy on caramelized sugar, dates, and figs. Burnt malt is also apparent, with belgian yeast/ witch hazel also present. Hops arent present but alcohol flavor is high. 

Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Head retention added slightly to the substance of the beer.

It took me just shy of seven years here on RateBeer to get to 1000 ratings, so why not make it what is still rated as the best beer in the world? Bottle from the ""brick"" that Westvleteren made available by the monks on 12.12.12, purchased at Holiday Wine Cellar where Mark graciously held one of the bricks for me while I was out of town on business ($84.99 for six-pack ""brick"" with two glasses). My firstborn child was born on 10.28.2012 and I assume that this was packaged around the same time as his birth...will save and age a couple of the bottles for sharing with him on his 18th or 21st birthday (previously drank two bottles so I still have three left). POURS a deep brown hue with red/purple/garnet highlights and two fingers of loud fizzy beige foam that reduced to one finger but holds. AROMA is quite complex with various notes of raisins and other dried/candied fruit (cherries, figs, dates), tawny port, buttery caramel, honey, Belgian yeast, and mild Christmas spicing. FLAVOR is equally complex with notes of port wine, dark grapes, thick toffee, molasses, overripe dark fruit, sweet dark berries, nutty malts, dry oak, and hints of chocolate and dry spice. Flavor definitely becomes richer as it warms...each sip reveals a different nuance than the previous one. Odd that such a high ABV beer has such big carbonation, but it adds to the mouthfeel and perception of flavor. The high alcohol is utterly concealed and it is not too heavy on the palate, making this a very easy quaff. Amazing that this much flavor and complexity can be coaxed from the basic beer ingredients (plus candi sugar) alone without barrel aging...though I think my own three years of cellar aging has helped. An absolutely amazing beer, and I am looking forward to more years on RateBeer as well as sharing this with my son in another 1.5 decades down the line.

2852,"2015-12-13",4.0,"Bottle (BB 01.10.18). So its finally time to taste the #1 beer here. Im really excited! The current average score is a phenomenal 4.44, but will it live up to the massive hype? Lets see. Pours a dark brown body with a medium tall beige head. Aroma has some fresh dark bread, Belgian yeast, ripe grapes, prunes. Hoppiness is dry and earthy. Taste is very smooth, theres caramel, prunes, a bready note here and there. Grapey notes emerge occasionally. Finish adds something mildly nutty. The alcohol is generally smooth and presents itself as a warm afterglow. In comparison to other Trappist beers, I think taste-wise its actually closest to an aged bottle of Rochefort 8. I dont see too big similarities with St. Bernardus Abt 12, which is the beer that gets compared to this one the most. The only thing in common seems to be the nutty aftertaste. In comparison to Rochefort 10, its smoother and more easily drinkable but the level of complexity is not quite up there. So my favourite Trappist after Orval remains Rochefort 10. This one deserves a solid ""4"" but not much more. It is a great beer but certainly not the best beer in the world and not even the best Trappist.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","thirstyrabbit"

2852,"2015-10-28",4.5,"Yet another classic milestone type beer on a not so milestone event. Im very okay with this type of living. Im not sure what was more difficult. Obtaining a bottle of this, or mastering the pronunciation of the brewery. I really wanted to save this for my 1838th rating (matching the year the historic brewery first opened), but thats a tough waiting game to play, and I cant hold a backlog for more than a few days. I wish I could have tried this in a blind situation, to know for sure if this is as incredible as it seems. One thing that is for certain, upon pouring this, my first thought was ""this is a beautiful beer."" Best by 9/30/2018, so according to my researched math, this is pretty damn fresh. Shipped to me with prompt and precision by Beer of Belgium. Thanks guys! Ill contact you guys again for sure. Pours a dark, ruby, dusty brown color with a swirl of tan active fizz head. Its hard to put a hyped beer like this into words, when Ive been dying with curiosity on the subject for as long as Ive enjoyed beer. Tried my best to pour this at the proper cellar temp. I feel like I got it as close as its gonna get. Sweet plum like aroma. Flavor is very complex with raisin, smooth semi sweet. Rum like hints throughout. Oakey. Has a very nice warming palate that gets better and better. By far the smoothest, finest drinking quad Ive ever had. In a style that is always a rough go for me, this is a masterpiece for sure. I would very much enjoy an opportunity to open one of these on random special occasions. This beer is not perfect to me, but damn is it good.

2852,"2015-10-26",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2016 Bottle at Sin & Redemption in Toronto. The bottle was CAD 22, which makes  15.2 - for comparison, at Get Well they said it was CAD 40! No info about bottling date or BB. (Edit: ah, that was on the cap... didnt get to see that!)

Poured carefully into a Duvel chalice. Dark, murky, coppery brownish colour with a thin layer of light beigeish head that seems to be thickening as the bubbles rise in the middle. Looks really funny and entertaining. It really is increasing rather than decreasing - WTF? How is this possible?! .... Massive amounts of bits n pieces floating around. The head retains until the very end. The aroma strikes at first as brandy-like, but not at all overly so (its rather cold at the moment), its malty and plummy, nutty. Estery fruitiness, a bit of old basement dust and rotten apples. As it warms, I even get some chocolate. The first sip leaves a lip-shaped hole in the foam. Its really sweet, caramelly, jammy, it fills the mouth the moment you touch it with your tongue. No alcohol felt, but I love how it maintains its brandy- or cognac-like character I got in the aroma. The carbonation is active, body full. Really nice soothing warmth in the throat, nearing heat really. The alcohol stays out of sight, only appearing as this increasing warmth in the throat. Its got that same problem I have with strong, caramel-forward beers - even if theyre excellent at first, they later (half-way through) begin to aqcuire a metallic taste and shallow mouthfeel. Maybe its the palate-numbing alcohol? All in all I must say, it lives up to the hype. Loved it. I really did.

The moment I arrived back home, I learned they now sell it in many places in Tallinn. Damn it. At least the bottle I had was way cheaper.

Edit: another try, a while later. Got a bottle from Uba ja Humal in Tallinn, for  17-18. BB 11.03.2018. The head is much less as entertaining as it was when I last (first) had it. Massive bits still floating... Even though Ive had it sit still in the fridge for months... The head retains but only as an uneven film. Lace? Somewhat. Aroma and flavour still similar to what Ive written above. But seems boozier than before. Less as interesting. Wouldnt rate it as high now... Damn. What the hell, was the initial 4.3 really because of the hype? Or is my palate that much numbed? (Currently my 3rd beer of the night.) Pretty harsh on the palate too - thin and very active carbonation... Hm.

I gave it 5/5 appearance last time, that must have been for the entertaining head, but now, goddamn, it doesnt look good! Lowering from 5 to 3. Palate goes from 4 to 3... And aroma from 9 to 8.

Trappist Westvleteren 12  bottling date 02.12.2014  Best Before 02.12.2017

Appearance: Dark brown, almost black, slightly off white head. Excellent head retention. Head is very creamy and made up of tightly packed bubbles. Some lacing that has dried out on side of glass as I am taking my time to drink this thick, sticky brew.

Aroma: Port wine and malt.

Taste: Brown bread. Long lasting sweet, malty Horlicks aftertaste. All bran with warm milk taste is quite strong. Port in the middle. What really stands out is just how long the taste lasts after swallowing.

Overall: I was extremely tired when reviewing this and unfortunately was unable to pick out the aromas as I would have liked. Will revisit. Prefer this over the Rochefort 10 that I had last night, but this is a little older and IF the Rochefort 10 is anything like the 8, it tastes much better with a little longer behind it, once the yeast has settled down.","Bern, SWITZERLAND","MrDell"

Caramel, dark fruits, and figs accompany a brilliant butterscotch. There is a little bit of an apple cider finish to it, which is way too smooth.

Palate is loads bigger than 8, with deeply intense notes of dark fruit - figs, dates, raisinated grapes - toffee, molasses, cinnamon, clove, allspice, pecan. Middle onwards the beer dries out and spices and nuts become more prominent along with stone minerality. Bitterness in the finish from moderate roast counteracts the complex fruit flavours and harmonizes with the spicebox character. Mouthfeel is medium full, creamy soft carb, no alcohol. As expected, a lot of the same touchstones of flavour as the 8, but more intense and richer. Feels much better in the mouth.

Thanks to my little brother for picking it up at Johns Grocery for me, and thanks to pepsican for packing it up and shipping it here.

Plums, dark fruit, toffee, bread, dough, molasses, and grape. Intoxicating. Pretty much everything I could hope for in a quad. Despite being nearly 3 years old now, it doesnt strike me as ""old"" -- still vibrant with no perceptible cardboard (well, maybe just a bit right down at the end if Im looking extra hard for it). Taste follows, with rich delectable molasses sweetness that is still nowhere near cloying. Alcohol is clearly present, but not harsh. Palate: full body, silky luxurious texture, soft-to-average carbonation. Overall: Most of the 6-pack is gone now -- shared with friends or given as gifts.

Aroma:

Medium/heavy aroma of malts, caramel, Belgian yeast, wood, dark fruit, bread and roasted malts.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. So extremely balanced, that it is by far the best aspect of this beer. It creates an outstanding flavour and an even better palate.

Taste: surprisingly strong alcohol flavor up front followed by fruit (raisin and plums) and lingering sweetness

Palate: smooth despite the alcohol, creamy even.

Overall: Spectacular beer! Second, in my opinion, only to Rochefort 8. I am partial to Belgian Strong ales so this one was certainly worth the hype and the cost.","Brookline, Massachusetts, USA","gdierksen"

2852,"2015-03-23",4.9,"When I heard about how highly regarded this beer was, my first thought was ""bah!"". Living in Amsterdam, I decided to seek out a place that carries them, and managed to find a small local dealer selling them at €16 per 12 oz. bottle. 

Pricey, yes. But the beer is Truly an astounding one. The color appears dark-brownish at first, but when held to the light, presents a deep reddish-gold. The head was tan colored, almost brown. Aroma was alright, but the taste is where it's at.

For an 11%, the taste is incredibly smooth. For how rich of a flavor, it's surprising drinkable. If it wasn't so rare and expensive Id be buying this beer regularly! I got hints of citrus, chocolate, coffee, and even caramel. Carbonation was perfect. 

It's a funny thing drinking this beer, you really do enjoy it, but end up drinking it so fast that you are wanting another! My only regret staring into my empty glass that's coated with the savory foam, is that I didn't buy another. 

10/10. I won't say it's the best beer ever, because that's just assuming everyone ha the same preferences. But I will say that it is truly, honestly, well balanced. It's the beer that I'd love to serve at a party, because anyone drinking it would love the smooth, easy-going-yet-complex flavor out of it. Simpletons can enjoy it, and the most-dedicated beer lovers will have no quarrel with siting down with a bottle of this. 

The monks at Westvleteren know what their doing. I'm glad that they are non-profit. It makes this beer special, and drinking it reminds you that they care about quality above all. ""Quantity"" in their lexicon is simply stating ""greed"", and this rare treat for me is worth remembering. 

I would like to get drunk with those monks.","","S_jenk"

Between my brother and and I we think we can taste fig, caramel, and light vanilla, can barely taste the alcohol, light light bitter end. Creamy and well carbed.

2852,"2015-03-13",4.8,"UPDATED: MAR 15, 2015 Uitgeschonken in Westvleteren bokaal, zalig aroma van rozijnen, vers brood, noten en chocolade. Diepe donkerbruine kleur met zachte rode gloed, met beige schuimkraag die terugzakt tot lage kring van schuim. De smaak is zeer complex, en zacht. Je proeft tonen van karamel, honing, rozijnen, vijgen, pruimen, vers brood en banket. Verder ook cacao, als in Belgische pralines, met hazelnoot, ook nog zachte specerijen als kaneel en kardemom. Deze trappist is natuurlijk zeer gewild en zeldzaam, en ook terecht in mijn optiek. Het is een buitengewoon mooi en gebalanceerd bier. Er zitten ook zoete tonen in van gedroogd fruit en karamel, droge tonen van de specerijen en een perfecte bittere finish door de gebruikte hopsoorten. Het mondgevoel geeft een mooie carbonatie door en een zacht bitter smaakpallet in de afdronk. Naarmate het bier opwarmt komt de alcohol steeds nadrukkelijker naar voren, maar de balans blijft perfect. De afdronk is lang en zacht bitter. Is het dan de beste Trappist? Naar mijn idee wel, maar de Rochefort 10 doet er weinig voor onder. Dit geldt ook voor het abdij bier Sint Bernardus Abt. 12 die ook heel dichtbij deze smaakbeleving komt. Deze ga ik zo proeven ter vergelijking. Verder zeer veel respect voor de monniken van Westvleteren, voor dit uitzonderlijk Belgisch biergenot, wat met toewijding en geduld wordt gebrouwen.

Vergelijk Westvleteren 12 en Sint Bernardus Abt 12: De bieren lijken op elkaar, maar de Westvleteren heeft een verfijnder aroma dan de Sint Bernardus, ook iets zachter van smaak en iets verfijnder en subtieler qua complexiteit en smaaklagen.Toch net iets lekkerder. De Sint Bernardus is iets scherper en kruidiger, maar komt toch heel dichtbij betreft smaak en aroma. Een goedkoper maar toch volwaardig alternatief. Beide bieren zijn uitstekende quadrupels en van een zeer hoog niveau, maar de Westvleteren heeft mijn voorkeur, door het meer verfijnde aroma en smaakpallet. De gebruikte gist is toch verschillend. Deze bieren horen beide tot de beste Belgische bieren die er zijn. Maar de Westvleteren 12 is onovertroffen.","Waalwijk, NETHERLANDS","Batavi"

Intense and robust aroma: cherry infused with red wine, sangria/gluhwein, parsnip, cassis, old sunflower oil (deep fryer oil), hairspray lacing. SB is sweeter: chocolate, prunes, some basement funk. Westvleteren wins. On to the taste: overwhelmingly robust and intense experience. Cherry and wine combo returns, dark raisins and chocolate in the development, sour high with perfect aftertaste (sweet, hint of chocolate). Nice warm alcohol feeling in the mouth. SB: a more mellow version of the Westvleteren with hints of vanilla and a creamy lacing. Less powerful, but really close. Westvleteren wins. Overall, Westvleteren is the more robust and developed version of the two; it tastes a little better and is definitely more pronounced.

The palate is fully carbonated and light bodied. Flavors show a perfectly balanced sweetness in caramel and dried fruit with a gently warming alcoholic spice throughout. Personally, having both an aged and a fresh bottle, this is the stage that perfectly showcases why the Westvleteren 12 holds the craft beer crown. Sweetness at the perfect balance, good body to maintain a great mouthfeel, perfect carbonation from the re-fermentation in bottle, and alcohol sufficiently calm to give a gentle rather than vigorous warmth.","Washington DC, USA","jc1762"

I try to find something but they seem like the same drink. I look for small differences in e.g. carbonation or bitterness but no. Perhaps this is a milimeter more bitter than Rochefort, but still very close.

Elle se verse dune manière admirable en laissant une mousse qui séteint assez rapidement et de façon constante. Au nez cest très chargé! Fruits foncés et cassonade dominent la dance. Mais ce qui me marque le plus, cest que malgré la grande et puissante complexité au niveau des odeurs, elle nest pas ""too much"", elle arrive à demeurer dans une zone agréable et cest un exploit avec tout ce quelle fait jaillir. En bouche, légèrement plus mince que je ne laurait souhaitée, mais je me rappelle rapidement quil sagit dune bière à 10.2%... Elle se débrouille plutôt bien finalement!

Aroma immediately gives candied sugar and dark fruits, forest strawberry, but also a maltiness there. The maltiness doesnt go away, cant be unseen now... Taste is rich, candied sugary, dark fruits, spices. Finish is heavy and sweet, with a nice hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel is extremely crispy-foamy. Spices, berries maybe, sugar Liquorice and a bit boozy. More balanced than the Rochefort 10, but not as balanced as Bernardus. Interesting that these three Champions League beers of the Quadrupel style are all so different in their characteristics. A superb beer, but this maltiness in the aroma... Besides that, a fantastic brew, but really not worth the hassle to get it. A good choice for the 100th brewery Im rating :)

2852,"2014-11-16",4.7,"UPDATED: MAY 29, 2015 Well, here it is then, one of the worlds very best beers according to this very site. I have been familiar with it for many a year and enjoyed it many times but it wasnt till the Flemish media made a hype out of it, following its election as best beer on this site, that every beer drinker in the country and abroad wanted to get his hands on it - prompting the monks at the Sint-Sixtus abbey to change their ways, introducing a reservation system and reducing the amount of crates per car (as the only official way to buy it, is driving to the abbey to pick it up). In other words: thanks to Ratebeer, it is even harder now for me to obtain it than it already was before (thank you, Ratebeer...). Anyway, for this rating I dug a 1,5 year old sample from the cellar and taste it at cellar temperature. It pours a deep, dark, brownish purple, clear at first but hazy with deposit, under a thin but remarkably stable, light yellowish beige, sticky, moussy head. The aroma is powerful, complexely perfumed and simply stunning: all kinds of noble sweetness and spiciness are blended into one mouth-watering bouquet I could sniff for hours; impressions of marzipan, old port wine and madera, candied orange, banana liqueur, milk chocolate, apple cake, walnuts, brown bread, vanilla, overripe pears and plums, cinnamon, sweet cherries, cognac, mint, cocoa powder, butterscotch, raisins and something vaguely earthy, only adding subtlety and complexity. In the mouth, candied and overripe fruits abound, sourish and sweetish both in a delicate and gentle way, banana, blue grapes, plums, pears, passion fruit and of course dark candi syrup, over a profound, fluffy, somewhat fatty malt sweet backbone, caramelly, nutty, chocolatey, with a delicately tingling carbonation adding a slight sourishness; towards the end, yeasty spiciness comes up retronasally, leafy and peppery hop bitterness and warming, liqueurish and brandy-like alcohol put everything into utter balance. Assessing whether this is the worlds best beer or not is irrelevant to me: I have always regarded this as the top abt-style beer in Belgium, a landmark on the Belgian beer map, with a delicacy and refinement seldomly seen. I tasted this younger and much older and even at 8 years of age, it was still a heavenly experience, on a par with the worlds best wines or single malts. Keep in mind, though, that the balancing, earthy and leafy hop bitterness declines throughout the years, causing the fruity and candi-ish sweetness to become more pronounced; yet after many years of cellaring, it also maderizes beautifully. I prefer this at 1 or 2 years of age but this is pure personal taste. In all: the best of the abts to me and one of the best Belgian ales, that much is clear. The fact that it is hard to get, probably added to its sheer mythical status, but I must admit that even for me - living in Flanders - the excitement of booking a couple of crates and driving to the far-out Westvleteren monastery to get my hands on them does add to the experience. Inspiring, appetizing, satisfying, this is indeed a classic in every sense of the word.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Intense musky earthy aroma, with strong hints of dried fruits, nuts, caramel, licorice, cereal and alcohol. Medium to heavy bodied with moderate carbonation. Robust and heavy, with a strong bitter and alcohol character. A formidable brew, Ive had beers with twice the ABV that seemed nowhere near as heavy nor complex as this. Its just so rich and heavy. A special beer, it definitely exceeds every Belgian beer Ive ever had in every aspect. Though modern American beer make its heyday same a long time ago.","Mexico City, MEXICO","Sdaniel90"

2852,"2014-10-24",4.6,"Bottle from Alko Arkadia, Helsinki (bought 8/2013). A dark brown color with a medium-sized, dense and very well lasting head. The aroma shows the worth of this masterpiece: it offers varied, rich fruitiness with a central theme of ripe apple, and also berries, floral notes and spices. Taste is sweet and spicy and rich and long. Long, slightly sour finish. Ripe apple and berries create a refined, wine-like impression. Full-bodied, extremely smooth palate with a low carbonation. Refined, multidimensional, potent yet somehow also very subtle, civilized - and not in any way overrated. As close to a perfect beer as possible.

The complexity of smell and taste is insane here. Started drinking when it was still a slight bit too cold, but as it warmed up the focus shifted a lot allowing me to pick out a load of notes which changing intensity. 
The variety and depth is mind-boggling; from cognac to plums, over cloves and burned muscavado sugar up to dried bitter orange peel and drops of fresh grape juice, to a good cigar, and much more. 
On the minus side I had hoped for a fuller mouthfeel and the last bit in the Glass got unpleasantly bitter, though pouring fresh is a remedy there.

2852,"2014-10-05",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2016 ""i was not expecting this to be the best beer ive ever had (although i held out a glimmer of hope it would be) but i did have high expectations, and realistically hoped it would be the best belgian ive had. not even close to the best of the night, as we revisited the 2007 Pannepot that kicked this beers arse. I cant help but think the rarity/legend of this beer has contributed a little or more to the 4.5+ AVERAGE score, but its #1-2 on another site as well, so that doesnt account for THAT many high scores. To the review (expectations aside) poured fairly clean (no sludge on the bottle rim or massive floaties like in some other belgians with a touch of age on em). ruby/dark brew with some fizzy tan head. mouthfeel was pretty smooth. good body, but a little over carbonated. aroma was doughey and yeasty...sourdough bread, which was different, but not necessarily in a good way. aroma was plum, fig, fruits, yeast, more dough. smooth again, and hid the alcohol well, but this beer did nothing to stand out. All 3 Rochefort beers are better, as are the few Struisse beers Ive had. I dont know what the fuss is about. Maybe if Im in Belgium one day Ill get to have it fresh, but Im not dropping more money on this to ship a bottle. In fact, Im selling my second bottle (which wed planned to drink, except that it was not worth what i can get for it). Disappointment for sure. Pannepot rocks. October 2013: From the gift pack release...much deeper, more fruit, less breadiness (which wasnt all that impressive). If Id rated just this batch, it would likely be a 4.3. Still not the best. but much much better. Not aure of age/transport on the first one, but that can be said about a TON of aother beers too that were better than the original 3.7.

2852,"2014-08-23",5.0,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2014 Inutile dirlo...questa birra è veramente un capolavoro!!! Il colore è mogano scuro. La schiuma è fitta, abbondante, mediamente persistente (anche se ne rimane sempre qualche millimetro per tutta la bevuta) e dal colore marroncino chiaro un po dorato. Al naso si percepiscono soprattutto sentori vinosi, da vino liquoroso (quali Marsala e Porto). Ma è in bocca che esplode in tutta la sua bellezza. Caramello, maltato, frutta scura (come prugne), ciliegie (sia fresche che sotto spirito), e soprattutto un buonissimo liquoroso che ricorda, come si sentiva anche al naso, il Marsala e il Porto. Finale leggermente amarognolo. Corpo decisamente strutturato. Carbonizzazione bassa, se bevuta alla temperatura giusta, sui 12 gradi. Se più fredda, la carbonizzazione è eccessiva e non si sentono bene né tutti gli aromi né i sapori. Lasciata nel bicchiere, lascia esplodere tutti i suoi sapori. Possiamo dire che ogni sorso è una scoperta, non annoia mai con il passare delle bevute. Fama veramente meritatissima. Unica birra trappista ad essere fatta, per quanto ne sappia, unicamente dai monaci. Il loro motto è: ""facciamo birra per vivere e non viviamo per fare birra"". Il non essere attaccati al guadagno, ma alla qualità, rende questa birra un prodotto veramente eccezionale. Una parola sullannoso confronto con la Rochefort 10, la mia birra preferita.

2852,"2014-08-15",4.6,"A kezdeti benyomások egy vulkanikus erejű habkitörést követően fogalmazódhattak meg bennem, melyek közül elsőként mennyeien krémes, tejszínes aromáját említeném egy lágyan pirított, mogyorós-diós-mandulás vonallal. Páratlanul sima és visszafogott, mégis összetéveszthetetlenül egyedi. És amikor krémességet említek, azt szó szerint kell érteni. Ha valaki csak könyvekben találkozott volna még e fogalommal, tökéletesebb szemléltetés egy korty Westvleterennél nem is létezik. Szétolvad a szánkban, lágyan elterül, szinte betapasztja a szájüreg minden egyes négyzetmilliméterét. Egy rakás alkotóelem jelenlétét véljük felfedezni, a szokásos trappista összetevők mindegyikét: diófélék, datolya, szilva, mézes harapnivalók és krémlikőr éreztetik hatásukat, az eredmény azonban lenyűgözően egyedi. Valahogy egyik fázis során sem érzünk előretörő komponenst, kitüremkedő ízjegyeket, annyira szorosan kötődik egymáshoz minden egyes molekulája a sörnek, hogy az egyes kortyok hatása minden alkalommal szinte előélet nélkül és a halványulás érzetét mellőzve, egyből a lényegre térve tör elő, pár másodperces jelenéseket idézve elő a varázslatból. Mintha minden ital legjavát ötvözték volna egyetlen palackban, az alkohol, mint közös nevező remekül elrejtett ereje, a likőrök gyümölcsös krémessége, a maláta teltsége egyszerre lép a színre, majd még mielőtt megfejthetnénk, megfoghatatlan összetettségbe burkolózik. Ezen ismertető után felesleges lenne tagadni az iránta kialakult csodálatomat, melyet nem elsősorban újszerű, soha nem tapasztalt ízek parádés felvonultatása, semmint inkább a nagybetűs harmónia titokzatos létrejötte eredményez.","HUNGARY","adster"

2852,"2014-08-12",3.9,"Managed to try two separate bottles, one from a promotional six pack but close to use by date, the other probably brewed this year. There were of course massive difference, the older one having lost its carbonation massively and while much sweeter at first, didnt have the pleasant aftertaste of the fresher bottle, which my ratings are based on. Having done the Belgium 6 abbey trip, this was of course a big must try, since the others I had all had before. Given its lofty rating on this site, I was at first a little disappointed, with the initial flavour quite mild compared to Rochefort 10 or Chimay blue, but it does maintain the flavour in your mouth and the sweetness comes through slowly. Like most Belgians strong caramel flavour with nice balance of light bitterness. Still, prefer the Rochefort and the Chimay triples but thats just my preference.

2852,"2014-06-18",4.7,"Third time drinking, first time reviewed. Won in an online competition (RRP AU$80). No date printed on the cap (?!). Poured in a Westmalle chalice. Had been in the fridge 15 minutes. 

Pours with a big, fat uneven head that hangs around for a couple of minutes. Typical dirty quad look. 

Smells of plums and brandy, brown sugar, Trappist yeast. All the classics. The typical quad smell. Most similar to Rochefort's red wine barrel qualities, but you can definitely smell the St Bernardus relationship. 

Starting to warm up as I sip it... Wow. My mouth is so full I feel like I'm almost having an allergic reaction. This is without a doubt the most complex beer I have ever had. The first time I ever tried it, I picked up on the fact that it had not just Rochefort's dark fruits, but also it's own sweet berry fruits too - baked together in a dry, yeasty brown sugar cocoa and raisin cake. ...and the flavour develops every few minutes as it warms. A third of the way in and I'm getting sweet, bitey Lambrusco at the front of my mouth and a wave of brown sugar raisins coming backwards over the tongue. I think it's still a little young though, hard to tell without a date. 

The mouthfeel is huge. Beautiful carbonation and alcohol warmth that carries the sweetness without St Bernardus' drier, doughier feel. 

Don't ever let anyone tell you St Bernardus is 'the same' (I've been to both the St Bernardus brewery and In de Vrede twice!). If anything, it's closer to Rochefort 10. At the end of the day though, it's just a beer and your glass will eventually be empty. Definitely the best quad, but Pannepot and Rochefort are essentials too. St Bernardus comes after this (in spite of the similarities - it still uses St Sixtus yeast, but Westvletern moved to Westmalle yeast in 1992 when the contract arrangement ended - somehow it makes a world of difference). Save up your money and go to Belgium. If you can't make it to In de Vrede it would be well worth paying €10-15 for on the grey market.

Full bodied, creamy texture, average carbonation (which is nice on this level of abv%). The bittersweet proportion, and an incredible overall balance are this beer real qualities.

Not the most intense but great quality aroma, showing notes of cherries, chocolate ribs, wood, liquorice, spirit character like sherry, dried sweet fruits like figs and almonds (sicilian Avola variety) some yeast and spices like cinnamon. In mouth, carbonation is lively and body is oily. Rich complex flavors take all of your senses, remaining balanced at the same time. Sweetness and tartness come first with malt, dark sugar, fine dark chocolate, red fruits, marsala wine, some green apple, then leaves a long toasted bitter and sweet finish and a lasting alcohol warmth. But I could say much more, the depth of this beer never seems to end. Leaves you ""wow"" and sad when you empty your glass, dreaming of having another one right by St. Sixtus abbey.

2852,"2014-05-15",5.0,"11.2 oz bottle. From notes taken at the St. Sixtus Abdij, June 7, 2007. This was a truly overwhelming experience, to have this beer (as well as the 8 and Blond) at the source. It ranks as one of the more memorable moments of my life, and I would encourage any and all to experience it for themselves.

This beer was poured for me at the restaurant In de Vrede, in the shadow of the Abdij itself. The beer is a dark opaque brown with a lasting pillowy off-white head that left ample lacing. The aroma is simple but complex: malt and dark, sweet fruits. The flavor is truly something to behold, and words are difficult to come by to describe the perfection. Notes of caramel, malt, spice, slight chocolate all combine to form the perfect beer. As the beer warms, each sip is a new revelation. As often as I have tried to rate this beer, the right words do not avail themselves. I am reminded of the film ""Contact"" where the protagonist agonizes over the fact that they did not send a poet through the wormhole. This beer is something that must be experienced firsthand. My highest rating I can possibly offer.","","RussianDragon"

Ive tried it on its own, and alongside 4 year aged St.B12. The four bottles of Westy 12 Ive tried are all fairly fresh, less than 18 months old to the best of my knowledge. Admittedly this is not my favourite style, but even with that concession I must say that this beer was excellent, but not anywhere near top-10 for me. The aged St.B12 was preferable to all present during a masked tasting, showing greater nuances and complexity, a rounder profile, and a less boozy finish.

Theres absolutely /something/ here that makes it really good - even better than the St. Bernardus abt 12 (imho), but as with Westvleteren 8 I cant - in good conscience - give it full marks because I feel its so damn overrated. But there is no doubt that it IS a REALLY good beer. But then I do love quadrupels. All in all I would like to have it more often than Im ready to pay for.

Aroma - the aroma is just as potent and complex as the taste - the aroma is comprised of alcohol, fig, raisins, anise, vanilla, and honey
Appearance - body color is a dark puce; the liquid is almost totally opaque with constant nucleation; the head starts about 1"" and beige, it does eventually settle but bubbles continue to set up from the nucleation there also remains a foam on the top of the body. Very impressive looking.
Taste - Wow that is very complex; its on the sweet spectrum - flavors include dark fruits - figs, plum, raisins, caramelized sugar, honey, spices to include vanilla and a few more. There is also the alcohol quality
Palate - body is medium; texture is slick; the carbonation is very lively; the finish has a lingering effect of alcohol and caramelized sugar bitterness, the length is long, and quite pleasant.

Is it the best beer Ive had? Well, its pretty damn impressive! I am glad Ive had it. Ive had other beers that have had huge hype. It lives up to the hype. I rated it as fair as I could. Its really good. Will it change your life, no. Are other beers better? I think thats really up to you, and what your into. I judged it on its merits. I meets all the criteria. I will also say, that some beers can meet the rating criteria, but arent enjoyable, that isnt the case here. It measures up and is excessively enjoyable. It is a classic.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"
2852,"2014-03-02",4.0,"Dit was de tweede keer dat ik de Westvleteren 12 heb gedronken. De eerste keer dateerde nog van een tijd dat ik nog niet zo kritisch bezig was met het proeven van bieren. Dat dit bier internationaal vermaard is, eigenlijk alleen positieve beoordelingen krijgt mede met het exclusieve karakter maakte dat de verwachtingen hoog gespannen waren. Wat ik me uit de eerdere degustatie herinner is dat het me toen meer dan gemiddeld was bevallen.Het aroma is zacht en herbergt toetsen van kandij, noten en mokka. Het is een subtiel aroma, maar zeer uitnodigend.Het uiterlijk is diep donker met een gezonde glans. Het koolzuur komt maar beperkt vrij en kleeft niet tegen het glas. Toch vormt het bier en mooie volle en dichte schuimkraag met een mokka kleur.De smaak vult de verwachtingen op basis van het uitzicht en het aroma volledig in. Het bier smaakt zacht bitterzoet met toetsen van chocolade en mokka. Het mondgevoel is veruit het beste aan dit bier, licht sprankelend, toch verfrissend maar met een ongelofelijke afdronk die je doet verlangen naar de volgende slok.Algemeen is dit bier dus en absolute winner MAAR wat mij betreft zijn er waarschijnlijk couranter verkrijgbare bieren die vooral qua smaak en aroma zeker een evenwaardig alternatief kunnen bieden.

En bovenal, het zou het beste bier in de wereld zijn. Klopt dit ? Ja en neen. Is moeilijk te zeggen aangezien er zoveel soorten verschillende bieren zijn. Je hebt de blonde bieren (tripels), de amberkleurige bieren, zoete bieren, zure bieren, bieren die gerijpt zijn op eiken vaten e.d. dat het moeilijk is om slechts één bier als beste van de wereld te beschouwen. Laat ik vooropstellen dat de Westvleteren 12 inderdaad een goddelijk brouwsel is, het is alsof een engeltje op je tong plast. De smaak is rijk, vol van smaak, je proeft o.a.toffee, kandijsuiker, donker brood, peperkoek en dit bier heeft een heerlijke zachte afdronk, ondanks het hoge alcoholpercentage. Maar als je geen liefhebber bent van donkere bieren, zal je dit bier nooit het lekkerste van de wereld vinden, wat de mensen ook mogen zeggen of schrijven. En ik denk ook dat dit bier als beste wordt beschouwd door zijn exclusiviteit. De hype wordt een beetje gecreëerd in die mate dat je jezelf als bevoorrecht gaat beschouwen als je er één mag drinken. En dat je het bier wel MOET lekker vinden.

Whenever eating at McDonalds, I stuff my belly with fries, a quarterpounder and some ""healthy"" beverage. After doing that I feel the same after drinking one or more Westvleteren. Ofcourse the balance of this beer is almost, almost beyond anything. But not beyond everything!
Eating McDonalds will stuff you instantly, and that is what Westvleteren 12 does for me. The taste is just too much, too impressive to enjoy, My favourite is, and always will be a different beer, and I have tasted them just as much I can tell you. Saturisation is what I think of when I drink a Westvleteren, freedom is what I think of when drinking a Rochefort, or an aged Orval. The aroma is too freaking much, just like drinking a Maggi bottle in comparisment.
Drinking one now, I have never left beers unfinnished, but I think the Westvleteren are champions at my home. I just brought back a crate, half of them are left with a quarter of a bottle. Got back two crates, again, but what a freaking hoax. The blond is okay, but I know better ones, the eight is doable, but not something to kill an elf for.

A classy complex brew.","Amersfoort, NETHERLANDS","DwarfeD"
2852,"2014-01-25",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2014 330ml bottle, poured into a Wesvleteren XII tasting goblet. Appearance is opaque dark mahogany colored with a thick medium sized tan head with good retention, that when reduced left some lacing. Aroma of caramel, prunes, raisins and spices. Flavour of caramel, prunes, raisins, dates, toffee, spices, honey. Taste is light-medium sweet and medium bitter. Palate is full bodied, somewhat oily texture, average carbonation and long finish. Westvleteren XII is an interesting beer with very complex flavours. But a surprisingly noticeable warming bite from the alcohol, therefore unlike most other Trappist Quadrupels like Chimay Blue and Rochefort 10 that pairs well with certain meat dishes and cheese, Westvleteren XII is best enjoyed just on its own.","Vallentuna, SWEDEN","SamTheBarrel"

Aromas of ripe dark fruits, chocolate and a bit of alcohol. The taste is really special. It has a really soft taste, it has a really complex taste. Chocolate, a bit of alcohol, and a taste that reminds me of Dr. Pepper soft drink. Also a taste which reminds me of mint, but I?m not sure. The beer is sweet, with a bit of bitterness in the aftertaste. It is really good and delicious! The mouthfeel is good, with good carbonation which is not too heavy and not too flat. The beer has a full body. It leaves an enjoyable warm feeling in your mouth and throath. But if I am fair, this is not the best beer I?ve ever tasted. For me, it is not the best beer in the world. It is not worth the ?9.50 that I paid for this bottle. You pay more for the hype. But still, this beer is really good.

Flavor of huge bread crust, dried stale bread, slight hot higher alcohol on the exhale. Figs and slightly sweet bit of raisin. Hints of old hay/grass. Less sweet and caramelly than St Bernardus and Rochefort (did a side-by-side with s.b. 12) Shares Rocheforts breadcrust without the dates/caramel. A very clean flavor - must have good water...

2852,"2013-12-25",5.0,"Rated on Boxing Day, 26/12/13 as ""Christmas 2013 Belgian Quads Parallel Tasting"" - Part 3 of 3

330 ml bottle (bottling date: 27/01/12). Thank you, Monna!

Preparation: bottle maintained at ambient temperature of 10°C - 12°C overnight; Popped at 13.1°C (within recommended temperature range) onto the Chimay chalice.

Looks: Cloudy hazy dark mahogany colour with chunks of dirt-like yeast sediments; Three finger head and beautiful, lasting light beige foam with a thin head that refuses to go away! Excellent sticky lacing with bubbly small carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant light alcohol, sugar and vanilla, with nicely-woven light plum, raisin, wood, musty cellar, Port wine, red wine, Bel yeast and malt. New aromas continue to evolve as beer warms. Amazing!

Taste: A great combination of flavours, started out with light but nice alcohol and sugar, then followed by freshy plum, raisins, light roastiness and nuts, wood, caramel, rum, light banana, light toffee, light cream, herbs, faint liquorices, shades of lime and faint grass. Yum!

Body: Medium. Slick and pretty creamy palate.

Mouth Feel: a subtle combination of tastes - intense and fleshy dark fruits, winey cellar (lovely!), nutty roastyness close to fresh toast, wood barrel, caramel, banana and cream. All in fairly light touch but together they works so well, very seductive to mind!

Booze and Sweetness: The 10.2% abv is its strongest suit - strong but absolutely not screaming at all. It stays silent for a good 20 minutes or so, the standard sign of a good brew. Subtle winey aroma with nice soft rum taste. How pleasing. :) Sweetness is also very restrained, just the right amount to complement the booze and give the beer some nice support. Very good!

Hoppiness: Not all that complex. Faint grassy nose; Herbs, thin liquorices and grass for taste. Some faint bitterness in the background but at this level, in reality its the lasting, tasty woody cellar-like sweet booze finish to round things up.

After Taste: Wet, Nicely sweet boozy and creamy to mouth.

Comments: Finally! I am fortunate enough to obtain the legend, AND choose the perfect moment to enjoy it and pit with the closest rivals, Sint Bernardus 12 and Rochefort 10. 

As a Trappist beer, this is low-key and unassuming on the outside, but full of subtlety within. Its Darwinian aroma completely won my heart, and the taste, through in light touch and not the blow my mind to the 4th dimension type, is extremely well-presented to back up the beautiful aromas. Impressive in a very subtle way. This is seduction at its best! ;)

THE TRIUMVIRATE VERDICT:
These three Quads evolved in quite different paths so the judgment is surely subjective. Anyway, this is my two cents:

Westvletreten XII:
- Subtlety is the key.
- Fantastic Darwinian aroma of cellar and wine.
- Excellent rum booze and sweetness.
- amazing taste variety for a Quad, all in right amount to impress.
In Short: the best of all three.

Sint Bernardus 12:
- Nice extension of strong Belgian Dark and more!
- Fragrant aroma and rich taste varieties. Richer than Westvelteren XII but with lesser romance. Big and hearty.
- Strong booze and nice sweetness, especially the bourbon!
In short: a close second to Westvleteren XII, slightly less subtle but undeniably nice!

Rochefort Trappist 10:
- Hard hitting whiskey and brandy is the key. 
- Head is flat, taste variety is rather limited of the three Quads.
In short: My least favorite. A hard liquor disguises as Trappist beer.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

A: Pours a dark mahogany ale with decent clarity. Single finger of fine and dense burnt latte head falls over the course of several minutes to a quilt of the same. Spotty lacing.

S: Butter, grahams, toffee, caramel, cream, hints of muscat grapes. Some dark fruits. 

T: See above, then specifically highlight figs, prunes, fired sugarcane. Good.

M: Medium to heavy with lower carb. Slicks on the finish.

O: This beer is good. Obviously well crafted. Multilayered and complex. Unfortunately, I disagree it stands up to Rochefort 10, oddly, given the last review I did of that beer. I will have to review it again, as I tasted tonight side by side this beer and found it in the forefront.

Taste: Dark and dry fruits again, mostly figs, raisins, small spike of higher alcohols. Smooth, creamy, caramel, toffee and cappuccino medium sweetness. Light brandy notes but not overwhelming. There is also some very subtle cellar funk. Ends with a good mix of light sour and malty aftertaste.

Pours a dark brown color out of the bottle. Lots of carbonation. The smell is great, and the taste measures up. This is a very complex beer. I believe the balance and complexity make this unique. At first you think it's just another quad, but as you drink it and it warms up, you start to realize there are nuances there that aren't in other beers. Of course it has a similar taste profile to the other Trappist belguims: the dark fruit, Belgium sugar with a malty caramel taste, etc. but the balance is perfect: not too much sugar; not too much malt; not too much hops; not too much alcohol; everything works together, and it takes a moment to realize how well it pulls this off.

Flasche vor 1½ Jahren direkt am Kloster gekauft, seit dem kühl im Keller gelagert. 
Direkter ""Gegentest"" mit dem Rochefort 10. 

Der Antrunk ist recht herb mit süßlich-malziger Note, leichte Anklänge an dunkles Obst. 
Im Hauptteil setzt sich dieses dunkle Obst fort, allerdings dabei schon fast klebrig süß, der Grundton einer herben Malzigkeit prägt sich weiter aus. 

Der Nachgeschmack dieses Bieres ist lang anhaltend, durch eine deutlich Süße geprägt, der Alkohol ist nicht zu schmecken - faszinierend bei 10,2%. 
Allerdings finden sich kaum Aromen - die dunklen Früchte treten hinter der süß-herben Note zurück, die stark an Oettinger Malzbier in etwas gehaltvoller erinnert. 

--> Ein durchaus leckeres Bier, von dem ich allerdings total enttäuscht bin. Das Rochefort 10 (überall in Belgien ohne Probleme für 1,50 - 2 zu bekommen) ist um Längen besser und wesentlich aromatischer!!! 
--> Westvleteren 12 ist für mich absolut überbewertet - wenn ich nochmal an der Belgischen Küste Urlaub mache, bringe ich mir wieder eine Kiste mit - aber mehr Aufwand lohnt bei diesem Bier m.E. nicht!

Incredibly rich flavor with heavy bready malt (almost like a märzen) being the dominant tone early, along with some raisin, a touch of brown sugar, and a surprising bit of almost spicy, boozy heat. As it warms, the breadiness takes a back seat to a sweeter Belgian yeast/candi sugar note. Its not as complex as past bottles, but still quite layered.

Sweet almost fruity aroma, a little more tannish head on the Westvletern, almost prune like aroma, definitely can appreciate a little more candi sugar and maple syrup on the westvletern... St bernardus is a little more subtle in its nose, not as aromatic, yet still slightly sweet... Both colors are nearly identical, deep brown caramel... Alcohol content is more apparent in the Westvletern, not outrageously sweet as I expected, but pleasant, not overpowering... Leaves a nice slightly yeasty finish on the palate, very nice and well balanced... St Bernardus is slightly sweeter which conceals the ABV better and slightly less bitter and yeasty on finish, however the Westvletern may be more complex... Both amazing beers

First sniff from the bottle and this is surprisingly beery and malt grainy. Not the overpowering hit of alcoholic complexity I was expecting. Pours dark reddish brown, with some nice reddish clarity in the glass. Thin off white bubbly head. First full on aroma is very malty. Caramel, ripe fruit, particularly a banana estery aroma, dark rye bread. Lots of banana and caramel, ripe plums. Taste is tangy and estery, but surprisingly quaffable and drinkable. Its caramel, banana estery, some light dark fruit, plums and a bit of brandy or cognac alcoholic kick on the finish, with some of that black rye bread. Texture is medium, not heavy really, and its quite sticky and sweet. Its less complex and heavy than Rochefort 10, but way more drinkable IMHO. I really like it. Could knock one of these back every day. 17.01.14 - comparison with St. Bernardus Abt 12. The Westy is definitely maltier and dryer compared to the fruit of the St. B. and the Westy 12 has a beautiful malty banana nose, which out-rates the St B. The Westy 12 although more subtle does have a bigger alcoholic kick than the St B though.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","EdKing"

2852,"2013-08-14",4.6,"(Rating #500) - On ne devient pas la meilleure bière au monde par auto-proclamation, juste parce quon le décide. On obtient ce statut par lapprobation générale. Carlsberg se targue dêtre «probablement la meilleure bière au monde», mais quen est-il dans les faits? Budweiser, «King of beers»... dans quel putain de royaume? La Westvleteren 12 est la meilleure bière au monde parce que des gens lont bue et quils lont vraiment aimée. Il y a peut-être leffet de rareté qui ajoute à laura mythique de cette bière, mais son couronnement naurait jamais eu lieu si le produit nétait pas exceptionnel. Et justement, il est exceptionnel  thats it! Pourquoi? Comment? Je ne sais pas. Chose sûre, je me ferai un devoir de vous décrire du mieux que je peux chacune des gorgées de la bouteille que je viens douvrir. 1) Sentiment envoûtant de sécheresse; cest à la fois sucré et amer. 2) Un peu de mélasse par-ci, un peu dalcool par là. Le bal est ouvert! 3) Une autre lampée  plus copieuse  pour goûter le grain franc qui donne un corps de déesse à cette bière. 4) Et on recommence avec des saveurs légèrement boisées, peut-être un peu vineuse sur les flancs quand on sy attarde. 5) Oui, du porto! Il y a définitivement des airs de famille entre un bon porto et cette Trappiste. 6) Sans commentaire... Jai pris cette sixième gorgée sans réfléchir, ne serait-ce que pour prendre le temps den profiter un peu. 7) Mes papilles sont saturées par lalcool et les sensations volatiles. Ma langue est engourdie par lélan émotif des saveurs à fleur de peau. 8-9) Une gorgée double pour tenter de goûter davantage, plus égoïstement, ce qui pourrait difficilement être plus intense. En bouche, des impressions de sirop dérable me titillent. 10) Je renifle mon verre avant dattaquer cette dixième. Des effluves dalcool contre-attaquent, comme pour me dire «calme tes nerfs buddy! Tu ne peux pas boire pas Westvleteren 12 en 10 minutes sous prétexte que tas envie décrire un texte de merde et aller te coucher par la suite. Tu vas la laisser se réchauffer un peu et prendre le temps de la laisser mûrir sur ton bureau». Et puisque jécoute la bière quand elle me parle (ça narrive pas souvent), je vais fermer ma gueule sur cette gorgée sensationnelle (oui, sensationnelle!). 11) Jai pris la onzième gorgée en écrivant sans même prêter attention. Je devrais consulter! 12) Je viens doffrir une lampée à ma douce en lui disant «tiens, goûte à la meilleure bière au monde». Puisquelle venait de bouffer de la pâte à biscuits, elle a trouvé que cétait boisé et alcoolisé, mais très peu sucré. La leçon du jour : ne vous empiffrez pas de pâte à biscuits avant de décapsuler une Westy; vous passeriez alors à côté de sa merveilleuse rondeur sucrée qui nous rend complètement fou. 13) Puisque le chiffre 13 porte malheur, jai versé cette gorgée dans la gamelle du chat. Depuis ce temps, son ronron est beaucoup moins grinçant. 14) Mon palais retrouve sa forme, je dénote une certaine acidité et des notes plus torréfiées. 15) Je fais tourner le doux liquide dans ma bouche et il caresse mes joues, ma langue, mon palais, mes gencives. Mon dentiste ma dit de ne pas trop laisser les liquides longtemps dans ma bouche, que ce nétait pas bon pour mes dents. O.K. mec, mais je bois une Westvleteren 12! Je ne vais quand même pas lavaler tout rond sans la laisser magacer les capteurs. No way! Sil insiste, je téléphone à lAssociation Dentaire Canadienne pour lui coller un grief! 16) Ce que je notais comme des saveurs de mélasse lors des premiers contacts se sont transformées en caramel, avec un peu de chocolat en périphérie. Cest magique! 17) Lalcool (10.2%) prend tout de même beaucoup de place dans cette bière. Ce nest pas un point négatif; juste un constat. Ici, lalcool ne semble pas amplifier ou porter les saveurs, il trouve sa place dans les méandres vacants. On goûte le sucre, puis lalcool, dans une alternance effrénée, comme une danse avec un tempo imposé par lurgence de finir le verre. 18) Je constate pour la première fois que la bière est pétillante. Pas énormément, mais tout de même un peu. Comme si les bulles étaient enfouies sous le lot des saveurs et quelles resurgissaient à la dernière minute pour nous donner un «kick». 19) Le fond du verre est visible. Jen suis presque nerveux. 20) Ça yest, le verre est vide! Jai pris ma dernière gorgée avec un biscuit que ma tendre moitié vient de cuisiner (les mêmes biscuits desquels elle avait tiré la pâte quelle avait en bouche lors de la douzième gorgée). Cest vrai que le côté sucré sefface, mais lamertume est mise en relief pour la première fois et ça donne une nouvelle dimension au produit. Je suis très heureux davoir tenté le coup. Et plus encore davoir bu une autre Westvleteren 12. Je ne sais pas sil sagit réellement de la meilleure bière au monde (qui suis-je, anyway, pour dire quune bière est la meilleure sur la planète?), mais je suis prêt à affirmer quelle est excellente. Dailleurs, jespère ne jamais marrêter à dire quune bière est la meilleure... LA MEILLEURE E-V-E-R! Si ce jour arrive, jaurai limpression davoir atteint la fin de ma quête. Jaurai le feeling davoir plafonné. Que mes prochaines dégustations seront vaines. Il y a tellement de découvertes à faire et le terrain me semble infini. Jusquà maintenant, cest cet horizon qui sétend à perte de vue qui me plaît, qui me garde en haleine. Je viens de boire une Westvleteren 12 et jai passé une belle soirée... Il sagissait de mon 500e commentaire sur RateBeer et cest tout ce que jai à dire pour linstant...","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","BiereLuc"

Very well-balanced aroma. Taste is moderately sweet, little bitter, little sour, very little salty. Staggeringly well-balanced taste.

Pours a dark red with a creamy head. Big aromas of cherry, fig, honey, Belgian sugars, dark fruit and bread. Flavors of dark fruits, cherry, Belgian sugars, slight alcohol (and in the nose), honey, and bread. Medium to high sweet. Leaves almost no aftertaste, very clean. Perhaps a tad bit over rated, but deserving a high rating for what goes into it. For the 40$ price tag per bottle, it was only worth for my wedding, otherwise, Id say it is worth 10$ per bottle.

About the beer; managed to get a bottle on the black market on holiday in Brugge. Also got the 8 and the blond, the 8 was great. The 12 was quite fizzy. The high alcohol content is noticeable, but not in a good. Sharp boozy notes dominates the taste.

The initial flavor was moderately sweet, lightly acidic and slightly bitter; while the finish was heavily sweet, slightly sour and lightly bitter with a long duration. There was dark fruit, brown sugar, caramel, figs, plum, prune, date, raisin, spicy and dusty yeast, hints of cocoa, candy sugar, slightly hops and something almost slightly off, cola, and vanilla.

The bottle leaves no information but the bottlecap so I had no idea of what to expect. The foam is not very stable and the CO2 is well present but not too much. Just enough actually.
Taste is deep and full with a very nice bitterness. Not sweet, just right. I couldnt taste alcohol, thats fine. The smell is spicy.

Alcohol is just barely noticed and I am very surprised to see how much is in here. Some brown sugar. This is so smooth and is just obviously well brewed and then some. The best beer in the world? A difficult question. But the fact that these monks have been brewing this for so long before craft beer became cool definitely has to count for something.

2852,"2013-06-13",4.2,"Rating #2000. 330ml brown bottle - a gift from verticalbaconstrips the night of RBAG 1. Im not really sure how old it is, or how it was acquired, Ive had it for over a year now. The cap has a date of 24.09.13. Brown pour, orangey highlights, hazy, some sediment. Dark beige head that fades to a small tight bubbled cap, some creamy edges and ok lacing. Nose has rich plummy fruit notes, sort of winey, a bit of rich alcohol, chocolate. Taste has chocolate malts, toffee, and dark fruit (plum and black cherries, raisin), a bit of late bitterness and some alcohol. Aftertaste has light hops, rich chocolate and toffee malts, lingering dark fruit notes. A lot drier than I was expecting. Mid to full body with pretty active carbonation. Overall, the Westy expresses everything I would like to see in the abt/quad style, it certainly stands up to, but does not surpass my favourites in this style.

2852,"2013-06-13",4.6,"As an american who has wanted to taste this beer for some time, I found myself lucky to have recent moved only a few hours drive from Westvleteren.  I recently made the trip and bought several gift packs of XII and also sampled in the cafe.  If you love this style, the XII is a real treat.  This strong has an extremely pleasing bitterness with chocolate and burnt sugar flavors -  it is complex, and, depending on the day, i would also say marzipan, caramel and citrus as well overtones as well.  I think that the key to enjoying this beer is to drink it at the right temperature.  I store at approx. 50-60 degrees and put in the fridge for 20 min. before drinking to settle the yeast.  If you drink immediately after opening, the taste is much more sharp.  I like to leave it to sit for 20-25 minutes, at which time I do believe this is a very close to perfect brew!  Highly recommended if you like the style.  On a side note, I also love the Rochefort 10 and put it on par w/ the Westvleteren, absolutely.  They are equally amazing.","Luxembourg, LUXEMBOURG","Lux8"

Medium/full body, thick oily texture, medium carbonation. Finishes light dry and bitter with fruit notes and light alcohol.","DENMARK","SlackerMads"
2852,"2013-03-23",4.4,"From bottle. Pours ruby brown with not as much head as I was expecting. Smells earthy, fig, peppery, spice with some alcohol burn even on the nose. No hop aroma noticeable. Amazingly Smooth mouthfeel with a very pleasant coating of the palette and only a slight alcohol burn going down. Have to reiterate the smoothness here. Only traces of bitterness, dark soda bread, leather, and then a earthy umami finish. This is not as mindblowing tasty as I thought it would be but I will say that is the most complex without being so aggressive beer I have tried to date. Thanks to Greg & Mara S. for sharing!!!

The best thing about this beer is the balance. I dont think it can be beaten. However (and this might sound blasphemus) i expected more from the taste. Similar to the Westy 8 its got that musty earthy taste but more sweetness and richness. Like Abt 12 but this is better.

Couple of centimeters of head which endures.  Smell - old ale, sweet and inviting.  Taste starts slightly sharp, there are stages in the flavour which intensifies.  Brandy/whisky notes.  Rounded flavour.  Alcohol is well hidden.  Spice, mustiness and spirits.  Nice beer.  (3.7)
Oct 2014 - Bottle, over 2 years old.  Dark red, quite clear, sparkling, big foamy off-white head endures, leaves sparse lacing.  Aroma is very malty, lots of green apple, some cherry, christmas pudding.  Body is medium, touch of carbonation, pretty foamy, tingly on the tongue.  Taste has lots of strong malt, soft apple, some butter, touch of spicy alcohol but pretty smooth drinking. (3.8)
Jan 2015 - Bottle, Dec 2013 vintage.  Very dark red brown, very big foamy beige head.  Aroma is biscuity and sweet.  Body is medium, foamy, low carb.  Taste is sweet pungent toffee malt, lots of spice, tangy rhubarb, gluey. Bigger flavour than the last couple of bottles. (3.6)
Feb 2016 - Vintage Oct 2012.  Taste is raisins, cherry cola, peppery spice, some dry booze, wood, aged malts, some tawny port.  I mean, this is a good and interesting beer.  But I really cant say its one of the best in the world. (3.7)","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"
2852,"2013-03-20",3.8,"12 ounce bottle by way of the American distribution series in 2012.  Moderately foggy brown with white foam on top, heavy bubble action that pops the top off the bottle. Aroma is hot and boozy, cinnamon, brown sugar, woodsy. Taste is primarily dry fruit, raisins, prunes, more of that liquor warmth, spice, sweet like a hot toddy.  Light side of medium in body, carbonation sizzle is striking.  Overall, this was a very good beer and a shining example of old, European brewing traditions. Once the printing press gave those monks some freetime, they did a knockup job with beverage technologies! It still compares to the best beers out there, all while tasting like an old world, medieval recipe. Its subdued and relaxing. However, it did not knock my socks off.  In a blind tasting, Id probably give it an A-. Part of the fun with any beer, though, is the story behind it and Westie XIIs history is beer folklore.","Illinois, USA","brian60625"

2852,"2013-02-19",4.7,"11.2oz Bottle. The pour was a medium/dark murky brown with a small (less than 1 finger) light brown fizzy head that reduced down to a thin film and small collar, which lasted throughout and had excellent sheeting of lacing.

The aroma was of a sweet dark bread malt and a bold doughy Belgian yeast with notes of toffee, chocolate, coffee, banana, dark fruit (plums, figs and dates) and a light alcohol presence.

The taste was a smooth malty sweet with just a touch of toffee and chocolate along with a nice mild roastiness early on, and then progressed with a somewhat intense yeast presence building up to a bold fruitiness and a mild alcohol ending. The flavor lasted an average duration following the swallow, and had a yeasty fruity alcohol taste that was left behind to settle in on the taste buds and lingered for a while longer.

Mouthfeel was just under medium in body with a texture that was smooth and creamy yet dry and slightly oily along with a carbonation that was tad prickly.

Overall this is a beer that comes with quite a hype, now I can say it most definitely lives up to it. It has a superb balance of flavors that I have yet to experience in any other beer. Yes, by far this is the best beer I have ever tasted. Thank God I was able to get my hands on some, for the monastery has said it will not be available again here in the US for at least 25 years (2037)...

2852,"2013-02-08",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2014 2013/01/24 - At Le Select Bistro, Toronto. Pours a typical dark brown/reddish Trappist beer color, with a thin off white head. Suspended particulate visible throughout. Aroma is yeast, banana, malts, lots of dark fruits and slight booze. Reminds me of port or pomegranate juice. Taste is sweet malts, lots of dark fruits (juice like) with a smooth warming boozy aftertaste. Has a medium to thick mouthfeel, with a nice carbonation. Incredibly smooth given the ABV. Fantastic beer. Is this the best beer in the world?? Perhaps.

Beautifully balanced between the fruity, sugary flavours from the malts, a slight hop bitterness and the hiding of almost any trace of alcohol.

Flavors are moderately sweet and lightly acidic to start, then finishes lightly sweet and acidic and lightly to moderately bitter.

2852,"2013-02-03",4.8,"I have had the luxury of having tasted several of varying ages and it is by far the most ""alive"" beer I have tasted.

When me and a couple of friends went to the abbey to collect our cases of XII we drank one in the pub across the street. It was full of various fruity flavors, a bit citrussy, raisins and plums, with a distinct bitterness which immediately reminded me of ""poperings hommelbier"" which comes from the same region and uses local westflanders hops. I rated it a personal top 5 beer straight away. But more striking was the feeling that this was a young beer that could get even better over time.

The second time I have had a taste was at a friends place who had a bottles which he had laying around in his cellar for 9 years, and a bottle which he had for 5 years. The oldest bottle was bad, it was unpleasantly acidic, it had no other flavors and we didnt even finish it. The 5 year old bottle was more interesting. It was already starting to get a bit acidic, but not disturbingly, the fruity flavors where much less strong and the palate was definitely much less. Like an aged film-diva. But at this age it still beats much of what is out there 

A few weeks ago I opened my last bottle of the case I got two years ago. And in my opinion the beer was at its best. All the promises the young beer had made came true. The fruity flavors where even more deep and complex, the bitterness had become more subtle, as had the sweetness. At this maturity level this truly is the best beer in the world.

There are only two beers that can compare to this beer: the Rochefort 10 and the Chimay Bleu. The Rochefort is an incredible beer (personal top5) but it is a bit les dynamic in aging. The Chimay is a personal favorite as well, with a promise of aging well, but I still have to try one that has matured. So far, this is the absolute best!","NETHERLANDS","lu_tze"

2852,"2013-01-14",4.9,"So this is it. Arguably the best beer in the ratebeer world, if not the world. This was a treat and consumed with my best man a few days after my wedding. I was wondering if this was the product of hype or something genuinely good; an internet sensation but an olfactory anomaly? I opened, I sniffed, I swirled I enjoyed and I was wowed. It has been the most remarkable couple of days.
The colour was a deep ruby, close to mahogany. It had an enduring cream coloured head that left a spiderweb of lace down the glass. I was impressed by the evident carbonation and how it was clear, not opaque.  I sniffed and then snorted. It was nearly ten minutes before I realised I had not tasted. I smelled currants, rhubarb, licorice, allpsice, candisugar, glace fruits, oranges, grapefruit, banana, guava, cinnamon, cardamon, dates, marshmallow, cassia, fruitbread, plums, damson jam, choclate dust, molasses and treacle. It evolved. It wasnt just one smell, it was a changing amorphous cloud of thousands of aromas.
I took a draught and was immediately wowed by the mouthfeel of a creamy, bubbly sweet and desserty body that was powdery as well. It had flavours that were vinous - red and desserty with nods to port, marsala and madeira. It had all the aromas evident in the flavour and all the changes that the aroma underwent, It was sweet and then sour and then dry. There was no immediate clash of flavours but it wasnt restrained: it was full of intrigue.
I had to ask myself, is this my favourite beer, or is it my most remarkable beer? I found that while this is my most remarkable beer, my favourites make up a long list that include this. The number one may change due to time, place and circumstance, and this will always be on that list. This will always be the most remarkable.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Jimthechap"

Smelled sour fruit up, followed by a sweet tarty flavor. Got green apple and kiwi. Also some malt backbone to it, mainly toasty caramel and toffee. Some light chocolate, too? Got better as I sat and smelled it.

Tasted similar to the nose. Just so damn smooth. Definitely could taste the alcohol up front. Some cloves, which I didnt get in the smell. Got the green apple and tartness. Also light hints of caramel, honey

Medium body. Thin texture. Soft (below average) carbonation. Long, smooth finish.

An obviously fantastic beer. Like Frank the Tank in Old School said, Once it hits your lips, its so good. One of the smoothest beers Ive ever tried.","","User134089"

Very small tannish head, nice alcohol legs but no lacing really, careful not to disturb the sediment at the bottom of the bottle. Bottle was served straight from cellar, it felt about 55-60 as the crow flies so to speak. Nose was estery, figs, jam, and maple syrup, and also 100 things I couldnt put my finger on.

Pours of muddy, dirty dark brown with a proper beige head.
Aroma is excellent, quite intense, with huge fruity character, mostly plums and those kinds of fruits.
Taste is epic, super rich and fruity - raisins, plums, pears, apricots and much more! Could feel candy sugar and syrup notes as well  
Aftertaste has a huge alcohol wave, which is a bit disappointing.

2852,"2012-12-25",4.4,"11.2oz bottled Feb 10, 2012.  XII version from the US gift set.  Served at cellar temperature.  Enjoyed on Christmas Day 2012.

Pours clear dark brown with red highlights and an active one finger light tan head that recedes to a small cap, but doesnt leave much lacing.  (not much room for lacing in the tiny Westy XII glass included with the set).

Aroma is dark fruits, cherries, alcohol, belgian yeast, bread, brown sugar, red wine characteristics.  Good to very good strength.  This glass isnt very good for capturing aromas...will try second half pour in a snifter or tulip.

Flavor is big overripe dark fruits, cherries, figs, plums, belgian yeast, rich bread, toward the finish some chocolate notes come up and more really dark fruits such as raisins, dates and figs, brown sugar.  Some alcohol burn in the middle and finish, but not too bad.  Moderate sweetness.  Extremely complex.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, sharp, fizzy carbonation, somewhat sticky.  As it warms to room temp the mouthfeel completely changes, much more full bodied, super creamy, soft carbonation, wonderful.

My Christmas treat!  This has always been way high on my wants, but never had much chance to try this...heard about the gift sets coming to the US and even then it was dicey whether I could procure one...lucked out and so glad I did!

Dark fruit, raisins, chocolate, spice in the nose. Nice light mild bitter taste, light spice. Sort of a light body, very smooth and easy to drink, no viscosity, no bite, just a nice comforting warmth. Some people say ""just get a St. Bernardus 12 and its basically the same thing"".

2852,"2012-12-18",4.4,"Bottle from 12-12-12 distribution. Pours a ruby-brown color with a fair amount of light brown, frothy head. Aroma is dried fruits: cherry, raisin, date, and maybe some fresh fruit like apple and pear. Also get some mild spiciness and yeast. Taste is a rush of sweet, sour and bitter simultaneously. In the mouth, the aroma is more complex-- Im getting rich dark malt, the fruitiness again, buttery caramel, vanilla, wood, citrus, and alcohol. Mouthfeel is lighter than expected-- I am used to a characteristic syrupy feel with Belgian strong ales. Carbonation is lively, also a feature Im not used to with this style. Finish is short, with just a hint of bitterness.

Comparing this to other beers of the same style and caliber, Westy 12 is exceptionally smooth. The flavors seem more complex and better balanced than the St Bernardus and Rochefort quadruples Ive had. Not sure if these qualities are enough to garner the title of ""best beer in the world"", but its damn good, and Im glad I secretly slipped out of work on 12-12-12 to pick up a brick at Binnys. :)","Chicago, Illinois, USA","sigh_borg"
2852,"2012-12-18",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 19, 2012 A bottle from the gift pack served in the Westy glass.  Westvleteren XII has a moderate tab head that never really disappears and leaves great lacing rings.  The nose is foremost fruitiness, ripe red grape skins, peaches, with even more ---  figs, raisins, dates, cherry, chocolate and molasses.

The body is very full, and the mouthfeel very smooth and at the same time lively with many tiny bubbles. The flavor is extraordinarily complex with everything you get in the aroma, with the addition of nuts like hazelnut, walnut, and pecan. and ripe fruits like plums and cherry.  The finish shows spices such as cloves, cinnamon and pepper. The alcohol is present but unlike many high alcohol beers adds to the character.

Saint Bernardus Abt 12 and Chimay have been my favorite Belgian beers for years, but I can say without hesitation that Westvleteren XII tops them both.  Is it the best beer in the world?   I can sure see why it gets that reputation.  It is truly sublime.

Aroma: Winey dark fruits with a touch of vanilla.
Appearance: Deep ruby amber color with slight off white head.  Lacing is minimal but the foam lasts for some time.
Taste: Two flavors hit straight away, port and booze.  The sugary coating on the lips indicates that the with out the high alcohol to cleanse the palate this would be nothing more than a sugar bomb.
Overall: Truly a world class beer that pure attention to detail.  These Trappist monks have shown me they are in a league all their own.

2852,"2012-12-14",4.3,"Bottle in cafe In De Vrede across the road from the abbey. Had to let it warm up a bit since it is served straight from the fridge. Aroma is banana, toffee apple and bubblegum, but a touch of alcohol vapour comes off unpleasantly too. Appearance is a deep brown colour, nice tan head, with a touch of lace. Taste is where its at with this beer. Toffee and toffee apple, grapes, caramel but slightly alcoholic in the mouth which taints what would otherwise have been perfect! Palate is pleasant, slightly thick with toffee, but again, tainted by an alcoholic feel, especially in back of mouth. Overall a great beer, but could be better as the alcolhic attributes ruined what would be much nicer otherwise. A touch too raw at this age I think, could always do with 6 months or so in a cellar.

Oh oh - what am I getting myself into?  Aroma is, well wonderful. Notes of dried fruit, toffee, raisin, fig, light spice and red wine all intertwine. Flavor is even more complex and nuanced, with all of the above plus strong notes of a good port wine. Medium sweet and no real bitterness. Very low carbonation, but that does not detract from the rich, creamy mouthfeel. ABV very well masked, coming through at the end as a bit of warming in the throat. Worth the hype on this one.

Quite carbonated, but by tiny pleasant bubbles.","Prague, CZECH REPUBLIC","omikr0n"
2852,"2012-12-01",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 6, 2014 Been drinking this since 1999, before the hype. Since then tasting old and new batches, preferably the aged ones. Not going to talk about pour, colour or on sight characteristics, but will concentrate on aroma and taste. This beer evolves in a unique way and is always an olfactory discovery.

Capsule date 03.09.11 - batch from 3 september 2008. Aroma is an intense round and full bodied melasse experience. Pours flakey yeast that settles to the bottom quickly. Olfactory bliss : Over ripe dates and figs, the distinct sugar cane aroma most WVs have comes out intensely! Dark bastard sugar, boozy (rum; in analogy with the sugar cane), slight malt and minimal oxidation : iron. Taste is viscose sugar cane, raisin bread, chocolate, caramel and again the dates and melasse.

Other tastings : bottled in 1978, 1985-87-89, 1993-94; 1996, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2009 and recently last week in 2012 + fresh batches.

2002 : About the older batches ; one of the smoothest brown beers around, when left untouched for months or years. Extremely well developed aromas. 

Chestnut brown. Aroma shows alcohol, wood, hint of smoke. Flavour notes highlight raisin bread, deep fruitiness (apricot). Long, sweet, silky malts in the finish, with dates and light bready notes.

Fresh batch june 2014 : pours a dark brown with beautiful head and lacing. Almsot like a matured 8 month viscose. Hops are balanced, need to settle but already promisingly soft and potent. Malt, candi sugar, hidden hop spice in the background... mostly dont notice this hint in other brews...  Visual : no visible yeast flakes in the residue pour. Tastes like a very promising batch.","BELGIUM","Beerconnaiseur"
2852,"2012-11-30",4.0,"Bottle split into tasting glasses. Murky brown with a generous fizzy head. Aroma is lighter than I had envisioned. Fruity and bread dough.

2852,"2012-11-24",4.8,"UPDATED: JUL 28, 2013 Tasted side-by-side with St. Bernardus ABT 12, which is supposedly a near-clone.  Purchased on eBay, shipped direct from Brussels from the limited release gift pack with glasses.  Extremely expensive, but a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.  Enjoyed on December 25, 2011.  Color is dark brown, slight reddish tinge, almost opaque.  Half a finger of head retreated quickly to leave minimal ring of lacing.  Nose is incredible - chocolate, espresso, roasted hazelnuts, spice - maybe even cinnamon??  First taste was surprising.  Lots of carbonation, dried fruit, raisins and dark cherries.  Many hop notes - piney ,a bit earthy.  Strange, nearly sweet flavor presents at the end of each swallow.  Almost a smokey, charcoal with a hint of maple syrup!?  Molasses!  Alcohol nearly missing escept in the after taste, where a pleasant warm burn is felt.

Compared to the St. Bernardus, I found it to be more yeasty and complex, with more carbonation and a more robust mouthfeel too.

UPDATE July 28, 2013.  Ive been saving these bottles and slowly drinking one at a time since December 25, 2011.  Cracked open the fourth from this batch today, and it has aged extremely well.  Poured with less head than the first bottle two years ago, but the mouthfeel is still extremely carbonated.  All of the original flavors are still here in full force, with a nice added smokiness.  Still a phenomenal beer.","California, USA","jdavidh"
2852,"2012-11-24",4.5,"11.2oz bottle from richdorchak, thanks for each of the vintages Rich! 15.06.14 stamped on the cap (bottled on June 15, 2011). Pours a rich and glowing, dark brown-amber colored body with an inch thick, dense, frothy and creamy, beige head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is incredible. Plums, raisins, rich caramels, bread, chocolate, dried prunes, alcohol, peppery yeast, and a few licorice notes. Flavor is similar. Bready plums and raisins, deep caramels, chocolate overtones, peppery yeast, light alcohol notes, and licorice. Finishes smooth, lightly bitter and spicy, lightly sweetened, and lightly warmed by alcohol. Lengthy aftertaste following a medium-full body and a soft, moderately lively carbonation. Overall, I went into this with high expectations and it certainly did not let me down. An absolutely outstanding beer. The aroma is sensational; so rich, fruity, spicy, and complex. The flavor is perfectly balanced for the size and complexity and each nuance seems to change with every sip. My favorite of the vintages was this one aged for about a year and a half. 
15.12.12 stamped on the cap (bottled on December 15, 2009). Less fruity throughout, but more tart plums. The malts have definitely smoothed out and there is a bit more of a chocolate essence with a slightly richer and deeper caramel. A few more banana notes, less yeasty and spicy, but still clearly present and nicely balanced. Alcohol notes are still there, but much less so than the newer bottle. Finishes more smooth with a lightly bitter and spicy, somewhat tart plum that leaves a lengthy aftertaste with some yeast sticking out nicely. Overall, I like the smoothed out version of this, but I like the fresher bottle better. The malts are really nice on this and the spices arent as intense. Not as fruity, but more tart. Still excellent and my second favorite of the three vintages we tried. 
21.04.12 stamped on the cap (bottled on April 21, 2009). A bit more chocolate on this version with much deeper and richer caramels. The spices seem to come out a bit more than the second bottle we tried with more yeast and a few tobacco notes. Less tart and fruity, but really nice raisins, prunes, and deep plums. No hints of alcohol and still phenomenal. My third favorite of the three we tried.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

appearance:
a beautiful dark mahogany color, deep brown, a rich and creamy foam, color slightly caramelized. In the glass, good effervescence, fine and persistent perlage is, spirals lens coils of very fine bubbles.

odor:
There are many notes that blend together in a complex smell where they condense aromatic fragrance and spicy, ripe fruit, plums, figs, raisins, lightly toasted malt, sugar candy, nuts, alcohol present but not intrusive, and a final cocoa and licorice.

taste:
Full flavored, rich, with a surprisingly soft and slender body, despite the strong alcohol. The mixture of flavors is at the top: the yeast, the bitterness of hops pale, slightly astringent red fruit. The lingering finish flows on velvet, a carpet of softness and delicacy, with a sensation of heat and light malt sweetness of toffee and chocolate. Simply a masterpiece.

Very very happy to have found this, I grabbed it and couldnt believe I found it since the packaging is pretty minimalist.  Appearance is decadent, a very very dark coffee brown with a rather thick consistency and a very abundant, frothy off white head that doesnt want to go anywhere.  Aroma is something I havent experienced before, it almost has a dough-like smell with notes of pepper, dark fruit notes, raisins, an amalgamation of multiple complex ingredients.  Taste is unbelievable.  There is not a bad thing about this beer.  It starts off with a sweet plum / raisin flavor, and finishes with a lively burn that gives an eye-opening sensation.  The mouthfeel is pretty thick and oily, the alcohol blends in nicely but lets itself known.  The only drawback Id say about this is that I cant get it readily.

Its got a similar breadiness to the #8 with notes of plum and red grape. Thats a nice combination, but it doesnt pack much punch here. On the tongue its all about malty yeastiness with a fine flavour profile of currants, cherries and spiced orange peel. Palate-wise I cant argue: its more or less spot-on. I cant help feeling disappointed though. It has all the qualities Ive come to expect from Westvleterens other two beers but falls well short of living up to the hype.

M: Slightly prickly carbonation with a nice and smooth medium body. There is some slight chew to it as well. Sweet and doughy on the finish.

O: While this was good Id rather spring for a Rochefort 10 anyday. It didnt have enough burnt sugar and caramelization for me.

2852,"2012-10-14",4.7,"Had this during a blind taste test with St. Bernardus with the hopes of not getting caught up in the hype. I then chose what I believed to be the best between the two. The taste between the two was identical with plums, brown sugar, and citrus all being the most prevelant. I ended up choosing glass 2 (revealed as Westvleteren) to be the winner due to how much more intense all the flavors and smells were. In short, they are identical except Westvleteren is WAY more intense on all levels which in my mind makes it one of the top beers in the world.","GERMANY","mcdav2154"

Half a finger of head settling to a lingering lace.  Had this cold straight from the fridge to experience the changes as it warmed up in the hand.  When still quite cold, flavours are subdued and shy, only faint notes overpowered by the alcohol, but as it warmed up every sip became different.  Dates and raisins and spices, vanilla and biscuit all matured and became much more pronounced by the end when the beer had very nearly reached room temperature, all of it warmed pleasantly by the alcohol.  Long, enjoyable finish that made my slow, hour-long sampling of the bottle very much worth it.  A very good beer, but I feel it is outclassed by my favourites Gulden Draak and Unibroues La Fin du Monde.

Le aspettative per questa birra erano davvero elevata, del resto se il popolo della birra la acclama in questo modo, ci sarà un motivo no? la birra si presenta in questa bottiglia che sa di mistero,data la sua difficile reperibilità, fortunatamente mi è stata regalata,quindi cè stato ancora più gusto nel testarla. devo dire che le critiche sono davvero azzeccatissime, la birra si presenta estremamente scura con riflessi bruni. Laroma è favoloso: predomina il malto, con sentori floreali, di caramello, malto tostato mentre il luppolo ha una rilevanza minore se non assente. lunica pecca è che la birra è troppo carbonata,ma basta versarla in un determinato modo ed ""abituarsi"" come al solito,che questo problema è bello che evitato. Il primo sorso mi ha colpito, come tutte le trappiste mi lascia perplesso: frizzante,molto potente, poco gustoso. Come già detto basta aspettare qualche sorsata che la birra si rivela a se per quello che è effettivamente: una bomba! il gusto rispecchia laroma, molto dolce e piacevole la componente maltata, con un tripudio di sapori che insieme la rendono davvero unica. finale lungo, dolce con un finale leggermente luppolato. che dire...unica..! grazie a gaetano per lassaggio!

riassaggiata un versione ""tutta per me"".. conservata gelosamente per una settimana nel frigo e gustata lentamente..bruna/scura con schiuma a grana fine non molto spessa ma che persiste (ovviamente), molto nolto torbida con tanti lieviti in sospensione..aroma sicuramente alcolico,di lieviti e di frutta matura sotto spirito,cacao,uovo,caramello..gusto SPETTACOLARE!!!! tutte le componenti aromatiche elevate allennesima potenza! carbonazione media,scende giù con una facilità disarmante..lalcool si sente anche nel gusto ma è avvolto dagli altri aromi a formare un qualcosa di sensazionale..estremamente corposa e palato molto persistente! il luppolo?non pervenuto! ma va bene,benissimo così..da questo stile sicuramente mi aspettavo un qualcosa di simile alle altre trappiste e bene o male ci va vicina..ma ha una marcia in più, a partire dalla potenza di tutte le componenti degustative,passando per il gusto particolare (differente dalle TOP trappiste rochefort,chimay) e finendo per la rarità, elemento sicuramente responsabile del rilascio di serotonina che sta avvenendo dentro il mio corpo :) cheers!","ITALY","zaf"

2012 bottle tasting in 2015... Tons of raisin, brown bread. Alcohol is incredibly well hidden. So smooth. Some rum Flavours. Bottle from 2005 (10 years old): so smooth. Nose very syrupy.

Spice is the first thing that hits me on the nose. Theres a cola nut aroma as well as stewed fruit.  I keep thinking fig for some reason as well. **NOTE** I immediately came back to up the score after I let this warm up to near room temperature which really lets the nose come out. Reminds me a lot of bourbon and coke with some added spice and fruit in the mouth. Mild sweetness on the palate thats tempered by the alcohol. Finishes a little warm.

2852,"2012-08-28",3.8,"Alright, this is my first Quad i have tried... and prob not a good one to start with, but here goes nothing. Bought in a gift set at Calgary co-op liquor (comes with a nice glass). Pours a dark chocolate brown, thick head which lasts, than turns into a nice thin head which retains throughout the drinking experience. Aroma is faint at first, but grows as the beer is warmed. The beer smells of rich chocolate malts and earthy yeast with a heavy alcohol odour. Taste is sweet with a lot of alcohol, which develops into a chocolate after-taste. The beer changes flavours depending on where it is on the tongue, close to the tip it gives grape esters and a touch of fruitiness. Toward the back of the mouth you get more of a rich chocolate taste. This beer has a good complexity but was not quite as good as the hype. I fear that some of the flavours may have been dulled on the trip across the pond, or this special edition box set release to raise money for the monasteries  is not quite up to par.

Pours a sedimented medium brown that re-radiates light faintly.  A tight soapy tan head starts large, diminishes but stays with almost no lace.  The aroma is spectacular--complex and dynamic.  It starts a bit tight and hot but opens up on top of a deep fairly fresh sweet raisin bread and yeast backbone.  Aromas of vanilla, pepper, apples and orchard fruit esters unfold. There are hints or burnt caramel, burnt orange and hot pepper dark chocolate.  The flavor is very sweet but balanced by a surprisingly amount of spice and bitterness that lasts.  The mouthfeel starts super soft, velvety, lively; tends a bit yeasty and oak tight on the sides; then ends with a tickle on the back of my tongue and throat.  Sugars on the tongue and lips along with the yeast sediment continue to work and work.  Best beer in the world...arguable.  It is certainly in a rarefied league.

now, about the 6 year old version . wel, THIS is complex. it drinks easy, but has a certain specialty about it. not overwhelming like craft beer, not in your face, but more background. you can taste the authenticness in this one. its a very good beer, but is it the best beer in the world ? deffinetley not. its woth the effort trying it once in your life, but the fuzz ends there. btw this is onley worth drinking if its 6 year. otherwise, take a sint bernardus abt 12 !","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"

2852,"2012-07-30",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 30, 2014 Beer bought at In de Vrede café by the brewery. Pours dirty brown with a thick head that settles into a nice lasting layer for the reminder of the session. Its not a looker, this beer, but the dirty brown color lives up to the rustic feeling of this legendary beer, and the nice beige layer of foam pulls up the appearance average.  The aroma is burnt and dried fruit, discrete at first but as the temp goes up it delivers more lovely scents. The taste is as rustic as the looks, caramel, chocolate, bitterness, fruit and alcohol. Long aftertaste. Compared to the other trappist beers, this one is the least accessible. Having brewed myself, it is impressive how a beer this high in alcohol can remain dry and sweet at the same time, though. The balance in the mouth is perfect, so is the carbonation.  Its a rustic but quite perfect beer of its kind. Hyped up, perhaps, but for a reason too I believe.

Update: Same batch, two years later. Aroma has faded into more of an unpleasant vegetable smell. Taste is still rustic and powerful. The bitterness is surprisingly still just as strong. Proof: the beer can be stored for years.","SWEDEN","PalCabral"

2852,"2012-07-27",4.0,"500th review, and the last time I make a big deal about it. Done in a blind tasting with Rochefort 10, St Bernardus 12, and Achel Bruin.

Poured into a Duvel tulip, hazy brown with a small off white head. Smell is tart fruit, cherry, plum, pretty strong flavors. Taste is rich fig, smoke, oak/nut, a bit of alcohol heat. Medium body and mouthfeel. It is bold up front, pretty balanced, but the attraction is mostly in the smell. 

It gets better as it warms, almost a marshmallow taste, Belgian Candi Sugar, prune and red fruit comes out. Very rich and complex, but it still has that alcohol bite and doesnt go down as smooth as some of the others.

Overall a great beer, but my friend rated it as the lowest (a step below the 2/3) and I put it as third (4th being Rochefort). Different tastes for different people, but I say there is a lot of hype to this one.

2852,"2012-07-04",4.2,"330 ML bottle, much thanks goes to Adam Jackson for the opportunity!  2011 vintage. Served at cellar temp. Pours a deep ruby color. Small off- white head hugs the tulip which leaves retention.  Pleasing nose. Belgian yeast, spice and grape nuances. The flavor mirrors the aroma. Malty. Sweet but not overly sweet. Plum notes. Balanced to perfection. 
 For me, it is kind of like a beer / wine Hybrid. The grape flavor is like a finely smashed grape. Mouthfeel is smooth, creamy, silky and full, without being chewy. Finish lingers, like a warm, red wine. Full without being offensive or giving you a heavy feeling.  The Abv, isnt real noticeable, except for the mild warming feelings after the sip. I took my time drinking this, trying to really savor it. That in itself was hard to do, since the ABV was hidden with the best of them. Drinks like a standard 5 or 6%.  I dont drink many Quads, so its hard to compare vs. any that I have sampled.  However, I now understand why so much hype is generated over this beer. It really is top notch, anyway you decide to dissect it. The ABV is noticeable after I completed the glass. Is this the best in the world?. ?. ? Everyone has an option.

2852,"2012-06-02",5.0,"Attention!  Saint des saints...
Nous sommes au sommet des sommets, sur lHimalaya de la bière...
Ceci ne peut être décrit avec des mots ordinaires, on est confus devant
tant de beautés et de profondeurs.
Nous devons dabord présenter notre révérence devant le jugement de Dieu.
Cette bière a été élue, non pas par des belges, mais par des juges de la
planète entière, comme meilleure bière du monde, et ceci à plusieurs reprises.
Ceci impressionne, même pour un belge, habitué, il faut le dire, à de belles
dégustations... Et pourtant, en ce qui me concerne, javais coté cette bière
au top des bières belges, bien avant ses accessits et la reconnaissance 
quelle a eue à léchelle internationale....
Il faut dire que labbaye elle-même a aidé à la considérer comme une bière
dexception, tout simplement en réduisant la production et la distribution,
comme les vins rares qui réduisent fortement la production de la vigne...
et sont produits à échelle quasi confidentielle.
Donc produit rare, difficile à obtenir, un rien mystérieux, ou très mystérieux,
si vous préférez, et vous obtenez la bonne recette pour faire une bière de 
grand mérite, au moins au début de la dégustation...
Arômes superbes de porto, pruneaux et noix du Périgord.
Première bouche unique dampleur et de profondeur........
La suite relève de la symphonie, et je dirais bien plus, de la symphonie 
enchantée. Les sens ne peuvent même pas suivre ce qui est livré par ce
liquide divin. On utilise des mots qui remplirait un dictionnaire...
Mais les mots sont même pauvres par rapport aux impressions.
Donc on est dans lindicible. Nous sommes au sommet de lart, à
la perfection du genre, au bonheur absolu, comme dans lHimalaya avec
la lumière, le soleil et les dieux. On est à vrai dire dans la plénitude...
Et pour conclure, nous relèverons ce mot unique du bon moine de
Westvleteren, à qui on parlait du titre de meilleure bière du monde,
qui entre nous ferait du plus petit brasseur un Napoléon maître du 
monde...  mais pour notre moine, a seulement provoqué la réponse
suivante : « Noublions pas que ce nest quand même que de la bière »....
On en tombe sur le cul... pour les siècles des siècles. Amen.

It was livelier than I imagined it would be, pours the darkest amber with a good, long-lasting head. The aroma is both sweet and earthy, of the forest floor. The taste is suggestive of all those delicious dark things - caramel, raisins, muscovado, coffee, nuts. There is more than a little spice. Occasionally a fleeting suggestion of brandy. The finish is dry and lasts beautifully. Its certainly one of the best beers Ive tasted and, for me, edges out the Rochefort 10 for depth and gravitas.","Greater Manchester, ENGLAND","TripleTipple"
2852,"2012-05-31",3.4,"I dont enjoy being the contrarian, but...Pours with a big, lasting head, nice aroma of complex malt with the usual goods notes of dates, raisin, vanilla, bread. The taste is what I would expect from a Belgian quad, nicely matching the aroma in the various flavor notes. Unexpectedly, this is not as malty and intense as I would have thought. The good complex flavors are there, but they are more subtle than expected. Drier than I expected too. Prominent alcohol in the middle and in the finish, more than expected. Definitely more hop bitterness in the finish that most in this style. Overall, I do think this is more balanced than what I am used to, and thats fine, but more different than substantially better than some of the other great beers in this style. I do not find this to be as renowned as its made out to be, but its a good one for sure.

2852,"2012-05-24",4.6,"Serving: Bottle courtesy of Robert.  Big thanks to Robert for hooking me up with this hard to get brew.  It pours a cloudy brown with a pretty decent tan head.  The nose is a potent mix of spiced bread, vanilla, yeast, dried fruit, and brown sugar.  The flavor mirrors the nose with the yeast, dried fruit, and light brown sugar as the dominant flavors.  The spice, light wood, and bitterness add just enough balance.  What really struck me was the mouthfeel.  Light to medium bodied do in part to the combination of high alcohol and abundant carbonation, but it works well.  The finish is amazingly dry and the alcohol is all but undetectable at 10.2%.  I can certainly see why this brew is so highly rated.  My first thought after finishing it was ""I can drink this all day.""  Truly outstanding.  Tasted side by side with a Roch 10 and a St. B 12.  The St. B 12 was a distant third, but the 10 held up well in comparison.  With some age on it, I would put a Roch 10 neck and neck with this brew, but right now I have to give a slight edge to this one.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

2852,"2012-04-10",4.3,"13 Oct 2011: Finaly got round to opening a bottle of this stuff (had 5 bottles for a number of years), lets see what all the fuss is about.

Poured into a Westvleteren chalice, it looked fairly limp compared to its 8% brother, wispy head on top of a moody looking dark browny/red body. I tried not to let any sediment out the bottle, but a little managed to leap past me into the chalice, Ill drink the remainder of the bottle (a fifth) with most of the sediment at the end of the review. I am reviewing live as I drink this evening.

The nose is rich red fruits, dried on a bed of dark chocolate and aged with fine English Oak, this is a smell not to mess with.

The taste is fantastic, add some carbonisation and a heap of alcohol to the aforementioned aromas and youre half way there: I found a gargantuan amount of flavours and I now see why beery people clamour for this brew so much. Sweeter than I thought it would be (shared half a glass at the brewery bar when I bought the beer, dont remember the sweetness), but that doesnt detract from the tasting Im currently having, which Im really enjoying.

Very sweet taste and a slight bitterness in the finish. Complex and extremely well balanced flavours with all the components from the aroma, and in addition I get some Amaretto-like almond/marzipan notes. The alcohol is much better integrated in this brew than it is in e.g. the Rochefort 10. The mouthfeel is incredibly smooth. A wonderful beer, but is it the best in the world? Im not quite sure about that, but I guess the only way to find out is to shell out for another bottle.

2852,"2012-04-05",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 30, 2012 A friend sent me a 6-pack of these in the new ""USA Distributed Brick Packaging"" Im going to get another 24 of them while in Belgium next month but couldnt help but try one of these the day it arrived via mail. Best by 03.08.14. Taken out of my cellar at 59 Degrees F and poured into a Chimay Chalice. 

A - Poured a cloudy dark brown into the glass. Produced a 2-finger coffee colored head that subsided to a half finger almost immediately and was gone after 2 minutes. Theres still some head lacing around the edges and center of the glass. In the glass, the beer is a nice deep dark brown like cedar wood color with a lot of cloudiness to it. Very complex in appearances but standard to most Belgian Quads like Chimay Blue or St. Bernardus 12.

S - This is the standard Belgian Quad scent youd expect. Great bready and earthy yeast make up a great deal of the scent. Smells like a bakery. The dark fruits like figs and prunes make up the rest. Theres this different musty smell that I dont get from other quads. Smells like an old cellar or attic full of old photos and clothing. Theres also a slight bit of sweetness from brown sugar or maybe its just the dark fruit sugars that Im getting.

T - Wow. Incredibly sweet! Far more sweet than I was expecting and unlike any other Belgian quad Ive ever had. The sweetness and malts are almost borderline very watered down whiskey. Theres a burn that starts on the roof of my mouth and goes down my chest. Not expecting that at all. I get this syrupy sweetness that youd get from a flat pepsi and brown sugars. The standard quad bready yeast and dark fruits are there but masked by this overly sweet overly boozy feeling that really hit me in the face! Another sip and its still hitting me in the face. Insanely strong.

M - 90% carbonation on a single mouth swish. The booziness of this beer stays around long after youve swallowed. Its so insistent that you almost want to grab a glass of water to drink it down. Very very strong. Heavy bodied beer for sure.

O - Ive heard the arguments that Westy12 compares to Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus 12 in almost every way and those beers are fare more easy to find. I disagree. This beer is more sweet and more boozy than those beers in every way. I almost dont want to rate this beer and I promise to re-rate it after I go to the St. Sixtus Abbey in May to pickup my 2 cases of beer and have a glass that was brewed fresh. I feel like this bottle was very off for being the best beer in the world. I disagree and Belgian Quads are my favorite beer-style.  This was a great quad but not #1.

UPDATE: I opened a 2006 bottle given to me by tderoeck. Best by 2011. Cellared in Belgium then shipped overseas via Belgium Post to my house. Stuck in the cellar at 62 degrees F. Poured at 4 ounces into a Duvel Tulip with friends. Appearance has gown hazy musty dark brown. Basically, looks more like bath-water than the Westy I had in April. Smell. More dark fruits, Mustier, dustier just sort of attic smell like old clothing. The taste is meh. Its still Westy 12 but less unique, less enjoyable and a very high metallic finish.

The fresher beers was quite different from the one sampled before, and much better in my opinion. Pours deep copper, not much sediment, looks almost filtered. About 10 mm of very frizzy, light brown head. Chocolate, caramel, some yeast, banana, esters, alcohol, cherry, red fruit, plum and some wort nose. I actually like to serve this a tad cold, as it changes aroma and character as it gets warmer. Mostly sweet, with a little hint of bitterness which is just right. Warming mouth feel, but not to much. Very frizzy and stingy carbonation, which I like in quads. Medium and very drinkable body! Aromas (this list could go on for ever, very complex beer!): Candy, cherry, brown chocolate (as in not the bitter cocoa type), leather, sugar, candy sugar, caramel, crackers, some alcohol, some yeast, banana, some malt, very slight hint of wort (fresh beer, mind you), actually a hint of licorice, some dry nut flavour, bubblegum. Candy and cherry are strong aromas. I never thought I would give this score, but I cant find anything to deduct from this beers rating.

2852,"2012-03-15",3.8,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/18/2012.  Poured from a 33 cl botlte into a Westvleteren chalice. There is no more recognizable unmarked bottle in all the land. Best by 09.03.12.

My pour has a dark caramel brown color with a slight ruby tint, mostly opaque but transparent in the edges. Only a small off-white cap forms on the initial pour, and this fades to a few spotty islands remain, along with a fair amount of particulate, even with a gentle pour.

The aroma is full, deep, and smooth. Brown sugar, toasted bread, caramel, raisins, figs, plums, cinnamon, Belgian yeasty spice all combine to form a nuanced and complex aroma.

Especially as it warms up, the flavor is pretty fantastic. Brown sugar blends with toasted bread, caramel, and some nutmeg, cinnamon and general yeasty spice. Raisins, plums, and dark cherries come in as the body turns from medium / full to medium / light. Right at the end, just a bit of ethyl alcohol comes in, along with some red wine vinegar acidity. The carbonation starts on the light side, and it is practically flat by the time the beer is through. It is creamy and smooth, while still a bit grainy. Medium to full body.

The aroma is a vast canvas of intense Belgian yeasts, sweetness, brown sugars, caramel, plum, raisin, Danish breads, malty depth, cereals and gentle hops. It is very hard to pinpoint all of the various areas of this beer because of its complex structure. I never seem to get that big creamy tan head like I have seen on many pictures of this, I usually get a relatively thin tan head which seems to soon release into a fine skimming on top of the deep brown chocolate brew. The flavour is insane, extremely complex! There are brown sugars, Belgian yeasts, leather, sweet Danish breads, caramelled cereal malts, balanced fruits like plums, raisins and apricot. Great lasting flavour of dough and malty cereals also eventually you notice a gentle warmth on the throat though without even tasting any hint of alcohol, it could be passed off as a 6% beer because it is so gentle! Supple smooth buttery texture with a full body and suitably gentle carbonation. So much to talk about in this beer, very complex but very gentle and light without sacrificing any rich flavours you would expect naturally.

The four of us participating all exclaimed something when smelling the (unbeknownst to us) Westy for the first time.

Surprisingly strong caramel character too with a more tame spiciness than the others.  As stated, we all agreed that this was the best aroma of the bunch.

Extremely complex flavor without an over-reliance on the styles traditional spice characteristics.  Tons of caramel (again) atop a really interesting flavor profile.  Bready.  Significantly more interesting than the others.  Finishes slightly sweet with lingering caramel amidst the boozy warmth.

2852,"2012-02-01",4.9,"Bottle at Amundsen Bryggeri & Spiseri, Oslo. Served in a Trappistes Rochefort chalice. Deep amber colour. Small light beige head that turns into stable foam islands. Its probably hard to rate this beer in an unbiased way, considering the status and hype surrounding it. First impressions are not overwhelming - to me this is not an OMG, fantastic brew. It has a complex, quite alcoholic nose, but also rather restrained. With the first sip, however, I start to realize the greatness. It probably has all aroma elements that I have ever tasted in beers (except smoke and barnyard). Theres caramel, herbs, dried figs, raisins, fruits of all kinds (grapefruit, orange, banana, pear), resin, licorice. And its all in perfect balance, so perfect and complex that its hard to discern individual aroma elements. It starts off quite sweet, then a wave of herbal bitterness, and finally a mildly bittersweet finish. The alcohol is noticeable, but blends in like in a fine sherry. The body is full, yet the mouthfeel is surprisingly fluffy, making it easily drinkable without being light or watery whatsoever.

Palate is a bit sticky, some alcohol, creamy but stil very fine tuned. Tastes of oranges, some pepper, belgian yeast. Stickier than I thought it would be but still very interesting.

2852,"2012-01-25",4.9,"Finally tried it!!!  I have 6 bottles I brought back from Belgium last year.  I was stoked to break down and open one.  I have had their Westie 8&10. So this was magical.  I know this beer really is hyped up, but other than the appearance it is flawless to me.  The color is brownish/amber in the light and no real head to speak of from my bottle, a little foam on top.  Taste is alcohol ester, bread, cereal, spices, candy sugars, brandywine, amazing.  Great mouthfeel and palate isnt saturated but leaves a little to remember.  Great aroma of grain, clean carpet, fresh bread and there is a little monk sweat I detected! YUM!  Anyway fantastic beer, it really is a privelage to enjoy this beer.

2852,"2012-01-25",4.7,"4/27/09 - Updating due to a recent tasting. My gf got me a bottle for my bday (yes, Im lucky I know) and we shared it last night. It was even better than I remembered it.

---

Poured into a Rochefort Trappist chalice

A: Initially this pours a murky, sediment filled brown color but after drinking 1/2 of it, you can see ruby highlights throughout. thick creamy off white almond colored head. Unfortunately this didnt leave very much lacing at all.

UPDATE: There was barely any sediment in this bottle. It poured a beautiful, clear (until the very last ounce) brown/ruby color. The last little bit was a bit muddy but to be expected, I think. Head formation was decent and lacing was pretty much non-existent. Rating bumped to 4.5.

S: soon as the cap was popped off the scent of strong sweet fruit filled the air. Theres a medium heavy malting, brown sugar, deep dark fruits, cherries mostly and its slightly alcoholic. Smells like a combo of berry pie and caramel.

UPDATE: This smelled amazing and as described above. I bumped my rating to 5.0.

T&M: very smooth taste, medium bodied beer which is perfect for the style. sweet and malted, lots of fruits on the palate but so much complexity that its hard to pinpoint what flavors Im experiencing. Non noticeable bitterness or hop flavor. Needless to say this feels and tastes great! The only thing Im not too keen on is the ""bits"" of sediment that get stuck between your teeth as youre nearing the end of the bottle. I could do without that.

UPDATE: Similar to above minus the ""bits"" of sediment. This was clearly a higher quality beer, one that was most likely not aged for as long or aged under better environmental conditions. Taste rating bumped to a solid 5.0! Def worth it! Cant really find a flaw in the mouthfeel either - 5.0 too.

D: Pretty high ABV thats masked almost completely. Great sweet, fruity taste, if it werent for the carbonation Id think I was drinking some kind of concentrated berry juice.

Overall impressions: This is one of the most sought after, legendary beers. Given its availability, it makes it that much more precious and highly coveted. While it is a great beer, and a fine example of the style, dare I say that I think its slightly overrated and that there are better examples of the style available closer to home, namely Rochefort 10 and St Bernadus Abt 12.

2852,"2012-01-23",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 27, 2013 At the start - smells bready/yeasty, with fruit and alcohol -- very good.

It is THAT good - nearly perfection. The hype is real. If I have any knock against it, its that it is a slight touch on the sweet side... but its taste is so complex, that characteristic is forgivable.

Taste is long and rich, toasted caramel and dark roasted malt, wonderfully balanced and complex.  Not as smooth as the Westvleteren 8 but only due to the darker roast taste, which it coupled with the deeper caramel sweetness gives the 12 more complexity.  The sweet, roasty caramel taste lingers long after the sip.  A truly excellent beer, worthy of being considered the best in the world.","","dzimm27"

The taste is quite sweet, but still well balanced. 
This hides the alcohol very well, with only a slight warming feeling in the mouth.

I noticed that, as I was leaving, he immediarely replaced the single bottle that was ""on display,"" and that I took, with another. Pours purple-caramel with a whitish coarse head.

Fast schwarzes Bier mit feiner Crema. Ein leicht hefiger Grundton mit fruchtigem Aroma nach Pflaume. Schön vollmundiger Antrunk und für 10,2% Alk. sensationell unspritig. Geschmacklich startet das Westvleteren recht süßmalzig, geht dann zügig über in diese pflaumige Fruchtigkeit. Der lange Abgang ist herb und leicht nachbitternd wie ein lang gelagerter Armagnac. Ein absolut fantastatisches Bier! Die Frage, ob es nun ""das Beste"" der Welt ist, kann man getrost dahingestellt lassen, denn für höchst subjektiven Geschmack gibt es eben keine objektiven Kriterien. In meiner persönlichen Top Ten gehört dieses Westvleteren 12 auf jeden Fall und in die ganz enge Auswahl für eine einsame Insel. Was dieses Bier so gegenüber den anderen Trappisten auszeichnet ist nicht seine Aromenvielfalt oder seine Stärke, das haben die meisten anderen Trappisten auch zu bieten. Nein, hier ist es die wohl am besten gelungene Gesamtkomposition, alles ist wunderbar aufeinander abgestimmt, ausbalanciert und braucht keine Jahre der Lagerung, um schon jetzt ein tolles Bier zu sein. Absolut beeindruckend!

Well, here goes nothing. I had this alongside a Trappistes Rochefort 10. We would have done a St. Bernardus Abt 12 if we had one on hand, but sadly not.Anyway, this poured a medium dark brown color with virtually no head whatsoever.

2852,"2011-12-23",3.6,"Best by 2013. Opening this alleged masterpiece while watching Die Hard. Good movie. As with a lot of other Belgian beers, this was a gusher. Luckily I was quick with the glass and only lost a bit of the beer. Because the yeast was unsettled with the gushing, the pour is murky and flakey, and the head was soapy and dissipating. The aroma is in yo face with yeast and esters. Notes of chocolate, tobacco, dark fruits, dark sugar, toasted nuts. As it is swirled notes of toffy and caramel occur. Also a rather strong oxidized impression which is off, and notes of alcohol. The aroma is actually very nice, is has some nice subtle elegances. The taste starts off with heavy yeasty and estery sweetness, figs, dates, port like in the sweetness, chocolate and cocoa. At first the carbonation was almost excessive, and that combined with the high esters made a very harsh mouthfeel. As it warms and the carbonation dissipates, it gets more pleasant - but nothing like what I expected from reading other reviews.

A - Great dark brown body that allows a bit of light to pass through. There is a little bit of sediment that settled at the bottom of the glass. Fantastic off white/light khaki head that sticks around forever. Really creamy and tight bubbling with some moderate lacing and retention. 

S - Loads of dark candied/caramelized fruits. Figs, prunes, plums, raisins etc. This is followed by a great spice note and some light yeast and alcohol. Extremely well balanced.

T - Follows the nose. Candied dark fruits, caramel, and then the spices. The aftertaste is of Belgian yeast. The flavor is so well balanced and delicious. I could down pint after pint of this stuff. The alcohol is not noticeable at all.

M - Creamy, medium mouth feel with just the right amount of carbonation. It coats your mouth but doesnt stick around for too long. Fantastic.

With that said, Im not completely convinced its any better than Rochefort 10 or even St. Bernardus.  I dont know, its definitely not worse though.  Distribution is a factor.

Its an amazing taste - sour, sweet, and bitter all in the same sip at different intervals.  Theres a world of taste too complex for me to judge properly after one try.  The real problem is, where do you go from here?  Once youve tasted the best beer in the world, will reality begin to dull?

It is a good beer, really good beer and worth its hype, but to be honest I have tasted several other beers that I think have a more refined taste, mouthfeel, smell and aftertaste than this one. Still this one is good!
Though the Rochefort 10 is another damn good beer, maybe even better in my opinion.
Well I enjoyed drinking this and back then, many years ago, when I drank my first one, and there was a hype about this beer already, I know I could die happy, having tasted them all.
-----
Had this beer some times again, which didnt taste as remarkable as it did in the beginning. And had it during a blind tasting it became 3rd.
So I have to shave the number a bit thinner.
Combining all moments I drank this beer itll become a 4 I guess... Decent...

Spicy, yeasty aroma with tons of vinous dark fruits, peppers and earthy hops. Very complex, medium sweet taste with lots of plums, grapes, raisins, figs, dates and dark cherries. This is supplemented by nice, roasted malts with notes of chocolate and caramel and subtle pines. This beers aroma and taste is exceptional. Full bodied with a perfect balance of sweet, vinous dark fruits, yeasts, spices, earthy hops, roasted malts and sweet notes of alcohol. Soft carbonation. Lots of peppers and coriander that lingers throughout over the complex body into a sweet, yet dry finish. This is quickly followed by a delicious dark fruit presence with hints of plums, grapes, dark cherries, figs and raisins. Fuller bodied than other beers in the style with a slightly roasted character with hints of chocolate, toffee and caramel.

2852,"2011-10-18",4.6,"UPDATED: SEP 10, 2016 I just posted some comments on Reddit, this is what I wrote:Saturday night at my brother?s house, we start with a Pliny the Elder, kill some time talking, and then to the main event.He brings out a Westvleteren 12 with no sticker, plain brown bottle, some letters stand out from the neck of the bottle and only the cap informs that this indeed is the famous beer; unopened, we let it rest for 10 minutes, to let it raise its temperature slightly.My control beer, from memory, is a St. Bernardus Abt 12 which in my opinion is the best beer I have tried: complex, sweet, fruity, toasty, aromatic, just wonderful!I pour, slowly into Chimay chalices, and see how a perfect brown sugar colored foam develops on top, crowning a dark molasses colored liquid. The aromas, are muted, the taste is amazing, crazy good, similar to the St. Bernardus, but slightly more controlled, I feel it has no edges, it is more composed. But, weren?t they supposed to be like twins? Same recipe, yeast, water!To me, it tasted restrained, perhaps I could not appreciate the highest ranked of beers, I felt guilty: In my mind, the St. B was better, tasted courageous, like tradition, like a great beer: what Aragorn toasts and drinks with when in the company of great men!W 12 is great, but perhaps the hype led me to expect something far better in orders of magnitude that what I had in my hand? Is it really 20 or 30 times much better than a New Belgium Abbey Ale or a Malheur 10? Is it that the beer cognoscenti tout it as The Pinnacle of Greatness, knowing that this beer is almost impossible to obtain for an ordinary citizen, and thus will remain as a barrier of entry into their beer tasting club? Or maybe it is like the story about the tulips in the Netherlands.I feel disappointed, just have to figure out if with the hype or myself.","USA","Lacho"

Leaves a small but very creamy beige head. Oily lacing trickles down th glass. Lighter in colour than I was expecting. My nose is completely saturated in aromas of plum and grapes with and an underriding sweetness behind it all. Reminds me of a sweet, freshly cut piece of christmas fruit cake - lots of dark fruits and a sweet vanilla tone. The mass amounts of fruit come through in the taste. Lots of plum, raisins and grapes. Reminds me a little bit of this sparkling grape juice I used to have when I was younger. Grape undertones are very prominant. Quite a heavy, vanilla escence-like sweetness throughout the brew. Mouth feel is medium with soft carbonation. The sweetness lingered on forever. I did think the mouth feel could have been a little more full but at 12% it drank closer to a 5% beer.

Wow, this beer lives up to the hype for me. I dont think Ive ever had a beer this complex. Those Belgians are onto something here and very well might have a future in brewing.

The appearance is typical for most quads Ive had. Maybe a bit lighter but nice and almost clear. The thin white heads fades fairly quickly. Very little lacing.

The nose is outstanding. A little sweet but more than anything plums and grapes. Really surprised how much fruit Im getting on the noise. Maybe some faint vanilla and bitter orange. 

For being two years old its still fairly warm but not overbearing. I know its a high ABV by the taste but its doesnt knock me over either.Actually the warmness doesnt come into play until the finish. The taste is self is a nice and balanced sweetness in combination with some plums and vanilla. 

The mouth feel is great. The carbonation is low to medium and doesnt not put off any of the sharpness some over carbonated beers tends to do.

2852,"2011-09-28",4.3,"Had this once before, when I was only starting to like proper beer. Dark beer, not entirely opaque, hint of copper in the colour, nice off white head. Aroma is certainly the best in all of Belgium, dryer and less alcohol/raisins than some of its peers (for instance St. Bernardus 12, which some say is pretty much the same beer - it isnt). Especially the roasted, nutty flavour is something I have not found this much in other Abts. Also has a hint of licorice, unusual for Belgian dark beers. The dried fruit is very subtle. Actualy, the whole beer is much more subtle than I remembered it to be, and it is certainly a fantastic beer. 

What I dont like: it has too much carbonation, which just ruins the palate for me, which I remembered to be much fuller and oilier. Maybe I had a better bottle last time.

Anyway, certainly something special, but you dont miss much if you go for the (almost) equally fantastic Chimay Bleu or Choufe NIce, which are much, much easier to get.","Utrecht, NETHERLANDS","floris87"

You have to actively look for the alcohol to find it. It is balanced and exquisite, far more so, in my opinion, than the considerably sweeter, boozier, and darker Rochefort 10. I prefer the Extra 8 nose, however, because it is slightly grainier, citrusier, and less sweet. The taste is fantastic as well, with the same notes from the nose, making for a mostly sweet impression, with some bitter from the hops and some sour as well. The elegant hops are more obvious here than in the aroma. Theres also a slightly bitter alcohol note, more perceivable on the tongue than on the nose, but it actually complements it, as opposed to spoiling it. The palate feel is full and exquisite, very creamy, even a bit sticky, and elegantly carbonated.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

This gem pours a murky, swampy brown with slight reddish and purple edge accents. Head was bubbly beige and held for quite a while.

The smell is a buffet of ripe purple fruits: plums, currants, raisins and black cherries. Distinct Belgian yeastiness adds that desired bread nose.

Taste is very complex...really the epitome of quad brew flavour profile, dark fruits, cherries, some pepper and amazing cloves. That bready yeast profile is nicely integrated and somewhat subdued. Wonderful experience - even if expensive.

The mouthfeel is absurdly smooth, I didnt notice an strong alcohol in the taste but that first sip did warm me up.

2852,"2011-08-23",3.9,"Bottle courtesy of James and Streets. Shared with those two and Andy. Pour is muddy brown with spotty sediment. Whispy head. Aroma is apple/citrus/acid and Robitussum (??).

2852,"2011-08-23",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2015 So, my initial rating of this beer is below. It came out to a 4.3 total. I have since tried this beer around 10 times, and never thought that it stood up to that original rating. It has ranged from thinner in body with more light cola flavor to sweeter, almost syrupy. At the end of the day, this beer is inconsistent, and that is a quality that does not deserve a 4.3 rating, so the numbers have been updated to reflect my more recent experiences with this beer.


Tasted on 8/22/11 from a 330mL bottle obtained in a trade. Pours hazy dark brown with orange and red tints, a very thin and a bubbly tan head that recedes rather quickly to nothing.  The nose is super complex with tons of lightly burnt brown sugar and caramel malt, a whole bunch of fruity fig, raisin, date, and molasses, with just hints of bitterness and some alcoholic heat. The flavor is lightly sweet with all of the same caramel, burnt brown sugar, fig, raisin, date, toffee, and molasses detected on the nose with an added lightly green hops note.  The body is full and oily with light carbonation and long fruity caramel, toffee, and lightly bitter burnt finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
2852,"2011-08-18",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 25, 2012 Wow, I almost feel like a heretic... How do you rate a legend? Its almost impossible, isnt it? Lets deal with the basics first: dark brown pour with a medium - smaller than I would have expected - tan head. Aroma is unlike anything else Ive had. Not even like a typical Abt. Theres a lot of sugar of course, and dark fruit, but the yeast is present in a way I havent experienced elsewhere. This also carries through to the taste, which has the same balanced yeasty sweetness. The complexity lies here: plums, raisins, dark fruits, roasty and bready malts and of course brown sugar. The alcohol comes through a bit as the beer warms up but as with any good belgian beer, never becomes too much in your face. Body is surprisingly light, as is the carbonation, but the lingering aftertaste is LONG and one of the best Ive ever had. Thats a memory that will stay with me for a very, very long time. This might not fully match the hype for me, but overall its still among the best Ive ever had and the second best Belgian after Rochefort 10.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Ktwse"
2852,"2011-08-17",4.6,"Ah, one of the belgian beer worlds great achievements. Pours a fairly dark brown with a moderate off-white head. Nose isnt terribly potent but enormously rich, with lots of sugar, bread, belgian yeast, and lighter hints of raisins and alcohol. Flavor blossoms complexly and in a perfectly balanaced manner, with all of the brown sugars, fruits, yeast, and grains youd expect to flow through a good Abt. Alcohol is in the flavor but does not detract. Sticky, sweet, and lovely finish. One of the best ales Ive ever had and worth every penny of the $45 I had to pay to try it.","Washington DC, USA","caralkaline87"
2852,"2011-08-17",4.7,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2011 Pours a beautiful dark brown with a white head on it. A little fizzy actually. The nose is gorgeous wheat bread, yeast, malts, and toasted sugars. The mouthfeel is nice and creamy, but it is a little over-carbonated and has a fizzy feel on your tongue that irritates me when Im letting it sit to get the flavor. The flavor is very complex, so much going on. You get the initial hit of dark malts, and then flavors of wood, caramel, wheat bread, dried fruits, and then finishes with a nice touch of raw sugar. Brilliant effort. The taste hangs around and it sticks to your mouth for a while. I am tasting this one for days. Holy cow. This one had a lot of hype, and it certainly didnt disappoint. It was well worth the $40, but Ill probably end up getting my second highest rated beer for $6 a bottle on a more regular basis! :) Such a pleasure to try this one.","San Diego, California, USA","tool2scream"

2852,"2011-08-13",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2013 THE beer. Finally got another one in a recent trade. I decided to open it with a friend of mine and tonight just happened to be that night. Bottle poured into a chalice.


A - Pours murky brown with a start white one and a half finger head leaving small wisps of lacing down the glass.


S - Smells of dark fruits; like figs, prunes, and raisins; mixes with the sweet malt, chewy belgian yeast, and some damp earth. The alcohol creeps in as it comes to room temperature. 


T - Starts off with a sweet mix of dark fruits and candied sugar slowly giving way a mix of bready malts, spicy belgian yeast, caramel, toffee, molasses, and some chocolatey sweetness. The alcohol begins to rear its head as the ale comes to room temperature, drying the pallet. The finish is a mix of sugary sweetness and light heat from the alcohol. Amazingly balanced overall. 


M - Medium-Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. So damn smooth with a little bit of chewiness. The alcohol does become a bit tiresome over the course of the glass.


O - This is still one of my favorite beers of all time. From the dark, complex, flavors to the soft, velvety, feel you would be hard pressed to find a better quad. I cant wait for my next encounter with this amazing beer.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

2852,"2011-06-17",5.0,"UPDATED: DEC 2, 2014 Bottle into a Westmalle chalice...

Aroma: Dried fruits, alcohol, toffee, coffee, dough, yeast, dark chocolate, fresh pastries and wine!? Yeah, wine. The aroma overall is very floral. St. Bernardus has the basics down but this is a little different.
 
Appearance: Black as the LA midnight sky, like Rochefort 10. OK, maybe not, but it is a dark red with a cream colored head thats very dense with fine bubbles. I can guarantee its plenty hazy with all the crap that poured out of the bottle at the end! 5/5 cause of the crap that came out which would put most people off. 

Taste: Taste is similar to the aroma. Get a bad one and you might think its just average. Get a good one and you will be blown away. Crapshoot! Price you pay for not buying it at the abbey....?

Palate: Thick, oily, very creamy. The carbonation is intense but also very fine, and what I mean by that is that its like fine grit sandpaper in comparison, to say, a cola which would be much more coarse. Balanced well, alcohol is well hidden.

Overall: If you want to know what I think about the hype...read the W8 review. Its fantastic but, BUT, keep in mind its not magic in a bottle....only beer! 

Dec. 2/14, another rate but of the XII gift bottle with a BB date of 27.03.15......

Aroma is very vinous, lots of sour, almost rotten fruit which doesnt sound all that appealing but its backed by sweet aromas as well as some coffee and chocolate. Fresh baked brownies/cake as well. I swear this beer has one of the best aromas out there, it constantly confuses and humbles me and its what I strive for in my homebrews. 

Appearance at this point is a transparent dark red with a small off white foam that gradually diminishes. Im sure I can make it plenty cloudy if I poured with more vigor. 

Taste...quite sweet and savory backed with a bit of sour. Quite like eating a really good christmas cake with some chocolate. It certainly doesnt taste like a beer. Lots of vinous notes. Kinda has an old book/dusty taste. Sounds greasy but it really makes this beer that much more. 

Palate is phenomenal, I want to guzzle this glass down but its my last bottle...the mouthfeel is quite good, carbonation isnt as high as most Belgian beers but the beer is very smooth at this point. Super drinkable. 

Overall...the bottle I had before this wasnt very good and I was led to believe this bottle Im having now wasnt worth keeping. Oops. Im somewhat angry I cant get this as easily as Trappistes Rochefort but what can you do? If one of the monks from Westvleteren is reading this, Id be very grateful to get your beer, even if it was limited. 

An ideal world is a cellar constantly stocked with Westvleteren and Trappistes Rochefort along with a cute chick to serve me a bottle whenever I wanted and then leave me alone to enjoy the beer.

T: Oh my word! This is far more than I expected. Big bread and fruit just like the smell. There are definitely some spices, not sure what it is though? Not getting much alcohol but this bottle has a little age on it. More robust flavors of bread and plum arise as it warms. Fantastic.

Head is firm, soapy like and stays on during the entire drinking expierence (wich lasted over an hour in my case) The only thing that was a bit disapointing was the aroma. It was great, really great, but not what I expected. And since I dont like giving perfect scores, I call that the only tiny, wee, minor flaw in Westvleteren 12.","Den Haag, NETHERLANDS","MrHangover"

Aroma is of brown sugar, yeast, and molasses with some hints of dark fruit -- a bit of malt, not a lot of spice. Foams in the mouth initially, then smooth into the finish. Not thick -- feels very light, like floating on air. Taste is quite elevating -- some brown sugar, alcohol (which gives rise to a very noticeable warming sensation), yeast, malt, dark fruits, caramel, and some maple syrup. Also some spice, though not much. There is a slight bitter note that comes out in some layers, which is usually complemented by brown sugar, but there is one layer in which the bitter is slightly overpowering for a brief time. The flavor is very intense yet smooth. Overall, predominantly malty with a bit of caramel, brown sugar, hops, and slight spice.

2852,"2011-04-28",4.6,"Bottle from 2005.  An excellent brew that lives up to the hype.  Very much like its slightly lower gravity cousin, the extra 8, but obviously just a hair bigger.  Im not sure, but it tastes like the same recipe, just a little more of everything.  I actually found the 8 to be just a hair better, as the hops were a little more perceptible and cut the sweetness just a bit which I liked.

This beer comes in which an instant rush of fruit and spice.  Cloves, coriander and cardamom with bubblegum and bananas.  Hint of smoky, roasted nuts.  Slight tannic quality.

Little to no head.  Probably from the extended aging.  What little there was left a remarkable lace.  The yeast formed about an inch thick cake on the bottom, and the pour was quite clear as a result.  I drank half, then poured some of the yeast into the next half, because I like the associated change in taste.  Of course, after adding the yeast the clear brown became completely opaque.  The yeast lent a breadiness to the beer that I found quite favorable.

Very drinkable for such a big beer.  With all the malt sweetness, it has no perceptible alcohol.  Mouthfeel is rich, thick, almost viscous.  

Overall an excellent beer, this and the 8 are the number 1 and 1B beers in the world, in my opinion, and definitely one should not miss out on any chance to try this.","","alexjucla"

Tasted blind alongside St. Bernardus 12 & Rochefort. Despite not having had Westy in over a year & not drinking the others too often, took me about 20 sec. to tell which is which, surprisingly easy. Rochefort is crazily richer than Westy 12  12 is mellower, improved with age, quite good actually but the hype killing my buzz a bit, very interesting almost spice-like notes going on here, nice caramel, toffee & sugar etc. quite lovely but the hype makes it impossible for me to truly love this beer. Plus Rochefort 10 has much more going on & is sold @ the supermarket. Yes the hype is a bit too much with far too many people over the years having told me either that this is the greatest thing ever or talking to me about how this was voted best beer in the world, etc. or going on about how it tastes exactly like Leffe, the assumption that I simply have to love this is just a bit too much for me blah blah I have been hearing this crap since I was 15 years old. Maybe should up score from 4.6 to 4.7 but I will leave this one for now. //// Tried a 10 year bottle of this one again, pretty nice subtleties here, not incredible but incredible shape for a 10 yr old beer, liked it quite a bit, not the elixir of gold that people keep telling me that this is //////////// 2010 Vintage. 33 cl. bottle @ home. Re-rate. Copper, reddish dark brown with a creamy, small, beige, off-white head. Nose simple, mellow oxidation, heavy on candy sugar, brown sugar, syrup, light liquorish, spices, faint molasses, smell is mellow & not in your face. Taste is slightly oxidized, heavy on candy sugar, pancake sugar & brown sugar, dominate all, chestnuts, spices, light liquorish, leaves, touch spices, lots of nuts, hint lavender, oily, warming, Very nicely warming but not boozy like a fresh one. Very BE profile, dominant with sugar, its okay but lots of Belgians pack so much more than this. Oily, light oxidized body, slick. Good brew but there is better, similar in Belgium, overrated due to the perfect mix of rare but obtainable. Changing the score from 4.6 to 4.6 & that is overrating it but I have to keep the prev. scores in mind. I suppose my disappointment has something has something to do with it being #1 in the world. I suppose it is never going to happen that everyone will agree all at once about something. /////////////////// Tried another one, now idea of age, tasted a bit like a superior Westmalle Dubbel which sort of makes sense I suppose. Much fuller & richer. Very solid but costly, this was one of the label-less brewery bottles. Keeping the old score. //////////////// Also dont see any notes for the 1979 St. Bernardus brewed version which I tried. For that one, too much oxidation, the 1979 8 tasted really good but this one was too far gone for me. Definitely not as bad as it could have been, not very impressive either. ////////////////// 17.12.2008 Vintage, my last one remaining from the brick. Dark mahogany, touch ruby, small beige head. Smells like metallic syrup, sherry, coca-cola, vinous oxidation. Taste is liquorish, vinous & sherry oxidation, syrupy, vinous notes are quite interesting, thick leaves, herbs, touch coca-cola, caramelized cherry, faint bark. Fuller, slightly oxidising body. This is quite an interesting oxidation profile, I wouldnt really call it top or anything, this is past prime most likely. I would be more exited about this if it werent for the hype that this beer has. This is quite an interesting oxidation profile even if it doesnt feel prime anymore. Intriguing beer, I have attributed its popularity always partially to its ability to age well.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

2852,"2011-03-07",4.1,"Poured into a Kasteel goblet. Thanks to onedropsoup for this. I think this might be from 2009 due to the dateless cap.

The first (and only other) time I tried this beer I was at a tasting and had several brews before getting to this one. Boy was that a mistake. I couldnt smell or taste much of anything. Anyway, this time I get to fully enjoy it.

4.0 A: Pours a ruddy dark brown color. Initially, it poured fairly clear, but toward the end of the bottle, clumpy sediment started accompanying the liquid. Two fingers of mainly frothy beige head with slightly better than average retention and a formitable ring of lacing.

4.5 S: This is quite a complex brew! Surprisingly nutty, this is by far the nuttiest quad Ive ever stumbled upon. Dry as well (I suppose thats expected from the candi sugar). Earthy and musty, and toasty like there is lots of brown malt. Only moderately spicy and nothing really stands out in this regard (maybe white pepper). Fig, tobacco, and pear brandy fruitiness. Ovaltine-like chocolate and just a touch of booze. This is very nice, but Id prefer if it had some more power.

4.5 T: Not as complex as the nose, but much stronger flavors. Foremost there is brown sugar, caramel, tobacco, and molasses. Booze soaked figs, raisins, and prunes. Raw cacoa powder, nutty, and toasty. Peppery and to a lesser extent, clove, spiciness. Again, earthy and musty. Pretty damn good here too.

4.5 M: Light to lighter medium body. Carbonation is in perfect amounts with a good spritzy quality to it. Good amount of creaminess and super smooth with a touch of warmth on the finish.

4.5 D: I suppose this does live up to the hype. Its an excellent brew, but Im not so sure that its that much better that easier to get examples. Still, quite a brew!

Spicy, estery aroma with lots of vinous dark fruit, zesty pepper and earthy hops. Very complex nose with lots of plum, grape, raisin, fig, date and dark cherry. This is complimented by a nice roasted malt presence with hints of chocolate and caramel and subtle earthy pine. Peppery with coriander and cardamom as well as hints of yeast/bread, phenol and licorice. This beer smells exceptional.

Medium bodied with a perfect balance of sweet, vinous dark fruit, eatery yeast, zesty spice, earthy hops, roasted malt and sweet alcohol. Soft carbonation up front with a heavy spice profile. Lots of zesty pepper and coriander that lingers throughout over the complex body into a sweet yet dry finish. This is quickly countered by a delicious dark fruit presence with hints of plum, grape, dark cherry, fig and raisin. The sweetness from the yeast is complimented perfectly by a prominent malt character. Fuller bodied than other beers in the style with a slightly roasted character giving off hints of chocolate, toffee and caramel. In addition to all of these flavors, there is a subtle earthy hop presence that adds more depth, balance and complexity. Its not overpowering, providing just enough bitterness to balance things out a bit.

This beer is dangerously drinkable at 10.2%.

Overall, this beer incredibly complex, delicious and extremely quaffable. The best example of the style that Ive tried and one of the best beers Ive ever drank.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Pours a super syrupy brown with nearly zero head on a careful pour. Smells very bready along with nuts and dark fruit. The taste is delicate brown sugar malt with several layers of sweetness.

The taste.. It is THAT good - nearly perfection.  The hype is real.  If I have any knock against it, its that it is a slight touch on the sweet side... but its taste is so complex, that characteristic is forgivable.

2852,"2011-02-04",4.7,"Drink by date of 9/3/2005 date on the cap. Pours a dark brown, lots of carbonation and thin quick fading off-white head. Aroma started to emanate out of the bottle as soon as the seal was broken on the cap. Aroma is very complex with a strong estery nose composed of a mild banana presence, a mild toasted malt and caramel sweetness, lots of Belgian candy sugar sweetness, very low liquorish and raisin with an almost cookie like finish to the nose. Flavor is fantastic! Strong candy sweetness up front with a mild smooth toasted malt in the middle. Light notes of banana and a complex estery flavor are also in there. Smooth brown sugar, light raisin with a very long lasting combo of caramel and sugar finish. Body is pretty heavy and holds a lot of residual sugar feeling. Carbonation is very high and keeps the brew pretty lively. Overall - first and foremost I have to say thanks to JMerritt for this brew. I did have some reservations in trying this beer as it comes with such lofty expectations that I thought it would be difficult for the beer to meet what I have read and heard. It definitely did not disappoint. The quality and attention to details form Westvleteren shows. Aromas dont overpower but do give the brew a very intense quality not seen in too many beers. The flavor is complex, well balanced and provides a full range of tastes throughout th drink. Just an awesome  beer and one I will look forward to having again at some point this lifetime.

Very nice nose with pound cake, lots of plum, light molasses, blackberry, light tea leaf notes, nutmeg and mace, dark chocolate, fig, and sweet caramel; similar to the Rochefort 10.  Interesting flavor with so much malt richness and some fruitiness to match but a distinct bitterness far in the background; very fig- and plum-like, chocolate brownie, blackberry, spicy nutmeg and mace, still the molasses, tea leaves and faint twig bring just enough deceptive bitterness, and just a faint Colombian coffee hint in there.  The palate is nearly full, lightly chewy, round and velvety, drying, and soft to lively.  The finish is still mostly sweet with chocolate, some plum left, spicy nutmeg still, and the tea leaf bitterness lingering.  It really was worth the wait, received this complimentary from Beer Planet in Belgium for ordering 25 beers online.  Started very similar to the Roch 10 but the subtle bitter notes were amazing addition to a very rich and fruity style.  The dryness seemed to thin the palate just a hair and the complexity was amazing but not unparalleled.

2852,"2010-11-13",4.8,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2010 Transcription of an old BA review from 03-24-2010, with scores adjusted to RB scale. Will re-rate...someday.

The review comprises notes from separate tastings of two different vintages. Scores are for vintage 2008.

Vintage 08:
The review is based on notes taken in fall/winter 2009.
Yellow capped ascetic bottle with best before date 03.12.2011. Considering that Westveleteren 12 beers are bottled 3 years prior to expiration date the beer is vintage 2008. The pour into St. Bernardus goblet gives muddy rusty - mahogany brown nectar with light tan bubbly head fading into an island of agglomerated bubbles. Aromas of sour cherries, berries, figs & raisins, touch of cocoa, breeze of red wine. The flavor profile is nutty-cocoaish with over-ripened figs, rummy with sweet malt base balanced by mild hoppy bitterness prolonged into lingering subtle bitter aftertaste. Silky smooth and creamy with alcohol unbelievably well hidden the roughly one year old beer is fruitier, with more expressed vinousness and less hoppy character than fresh one. 10 4 10 5 19 = 4.8

Vintage 89
I was told the bottle is 89 vintage therefore 21 yrs old although this cannot be verified as Westvleteren bottles didnt always have BBE date on their crowns. However, the 11% ABV imprinted on the cap indicates this was a pre-1999 bottling. Between 1999 and 2002 the alcohol content of Westvleteren 12 has been gradually reduced from 11% to the current level of 10,2%. Diminishing of ABV was necessary to facilitate the brewing process as high levels of alcohol are more likely to kill the yeast. To the beer.
Into Westvleteren chalice. Clear coppery-mahogany brown body lacking any head apart from short lived bubbly island floating on the surface. In over two decades of aging the beer has undergone a complete transformation from quad to fortified wine or even liqueur: at this stage is highly viscous, alcoholic, sweet and abounds in fruity esters.
Palpable aromas of strongly fortified, port-like wine, intense sugary sweetness, plums, dried fruits represented by prunes, sour cherries , figs and rum soaked raisins. Clear presence of alcohol which is well incorporated into the whole. Each aroma listed reincarnates itself in the flavor department that perfectly matches the nose.The mouthfeel of warming and liqueurish brew is syrupy but not in a sickly manner, with zero carbonation. Im pouring the beer carefully to keep the black slush at the bottom. Even so the last pour is hazy due to the raised yeasty sediment which adds some spiciness and in contrary with beliefs does not ruin the beer. Fully mature Westvleteren 12 is great, although does not have much in common with what I see as a beer.  10 2 10 5 18 = 4,5","SLOVENIA","EvilBuddha"
2852,"2010-11-11",4.7,"11.2 oz. bottle 500th ranking- $42.99 a bottle- This was part of a Trappist vertical, in order I drank Chimay blue first followed by Rochefort Trappistes 8 and 10 then followed by St. Bernardus abt. 12 and now this. To explain further The Chimay was the biggest disappointment, it was obviously good, but the worst of the first four, the Rochefort beers were just as good as the first time I tried them, but was expecting that the St. Bernardus would be better, it wasnt, both Rocheforts are a prime example of what a Trappist beer should taste like, so the big question, is the Westvleteren the king kong of the Trappist world.- Westvleteren 12- Pours a ruby murky red with a nice bone white head that recedes to a collar, lacework is good, aroma is stifled cherries and Belgian yeast . The flavor is less tart than the St. Bernardus and smoother than the Chimay, and less alcoholic than the Rochefort 10 and Chimay. The taste is mellow, creamy, flavorful, alcohol well hidden, it is hard to find anything wrong with this beer. Is this the best beer Ive ever had, probably not, but it comes close, very close, I would say it is in my top five, maybe even top three. In closing, Every beer in my vertical tonight had a flaw in it except this one, I do believe that it lives up to the hype. But it is not worth $42.99 a bottle.","Idaho, USA","Beerdrinker79"
2852,"2010-11-02",4.3,"Ölen är ganska stärk i doften, alkoholprocenten är välrepresenterad, men inte på ett negativt sätt.
Det doftar fantastisk gott av kola, jäst och lite söta mörka frukter.

Smaken är stor av söta plommon, lite russin och choklad. Tycker även jag hittar toner av vanilj.
Eftersmaken är mycket rund och välbalanserad, och ligger i länge, länge.

Ja, god är den verkligen, men är den värdens bästa? Nja, inte i min värden.
Faktisk så är det så att jag tyckte den nästa ölen vi provade var bättre faktisk mycket bättre, så Westvleteren 12 får bara en fyra av mig, men en god fyra","SWEDEN","SirLimpsalot"
2852,"2010-11-01",4.7,"Many, MANY thanks to Ben for sharing one of these with me.  If you like beer you will like this, its awesome.  SOOOOOOOO many flavors and high abv, yet so dirnkable.  Fruit, malt, a little hop, chocolate, alcohol, its all in there.  And it really tastes great.  If you ever liked a beer, you will like this.

I think the yeast must be a lot of what makes it unique.  Its got the most bizarre carbonation, and its fantastic.  Every time you take a sip it bubbles up and almost tickles you, then as soon as thats over you set the glass down and it looks like champagne.  Weird and awesome.

Get one if you can, I was lucky I didnt have to go all the way to the monastery!","Bethesda, Maryland, USA","dbarnold"
2852,"2010-10-30",4.8,"To finish a great day and evening of few nice beers after sauna, why not crack one of these, too. Pours murky mahogany brown into my Trappist glass with some sediment. Nice brown small bubbly head. Aroma is very nice with alcohol, malts, fidges, raisins, dades and sweet caramel but not as full bodied as I had expected. Flavor then. Wow, aroma was a bit ""low"" but the taste! Full bodied fruity and sweet, not too much though but just enough and a little bit more. Very lean mouth feel, you feel the alcohol but as a complementary part of the flavor and round enjoyable maltyness. Fantastic good! Palate feel is perfect blend of acidyness and sweetness, truly full bodied and creamy. Finish is amazingl; first alcohol and sweet fruityness turning into great bitter bite which lasts so long.","SWEDEN","tkrjukoff"
2852,"2010-10-29",4.3,"For my 500th ranking, I chose the one and only Westvleteren 12. This is also beer #2 in my Trappist tasting tonight. Will it live up to the hype? Thats why Im drinking Rochefort 10 right beside it and will be drinking three more Trappist beers afterward. Then Ill be able to decide if it truly is the greatest beer in the world. 33 cl botle poured into Trappist glass. Pours a murky brownish orange with a nice bone-white head that retains itself for a long time; when it collapses, it leaves a fine blanket of foam and some nice lace. Not nearly as much sediment as the Rochefort. Better looking than the other beer. Aroma is spicy, bananas, ripe plums, earth, cooked black beans, some funk. Equal in the aroma department to the Rochefort, but they are very different. Taste is sweet with no bitterness (towards the end of the bottle a little bitterness shows up in the finish); almost Eisbock sweet. Some apple pie in the flavor. Crisper than the Rochefort; meaty. Body is full; carbonation is soft; mouthfeel is creamy. Overall, better than the Rochefort. Although a fine beer, Ive had way better. I think it is hyped up a bit.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"
2852,"2010-10-25",4.5,"Aroma:Malt and grapes. Nice sweet aroma.

Appearance:Brown in color, nice head thats ecru in color.

Taste:Caramel and Malt, wine notes. The aftertaste leaves some leather, earthy notes.

Palate:Medium to thick in body. Hot alcohol, a little astringency, great carbonation.

Overall:Its a really easily drinkable, flavorful, complex, and smooth beer.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","fear025"
2852,"2010-10-20",4.4,"FINALLY!
Only took 800...or so...beers to get my filthy mits on a bottle of this. Was fortunate enough to share it with a mate, whose parents got a gift pack with 2 glasses and a bottle from a shop near the monastry itself. Needless to say, its been long anticipated!
Im presented with a hazy mahogany brown beer. The inch or so of head is very dense, slightly beige, clinging on tightly to the glass on its descent.
The nose is quite intense and complex; dried apricots, raisin, fig, brown sugar, grain husk, undertones of chocolate, clove and peppery spice.
Relatively low carbonation for a Belgian. Very creamy on the palate, excellent weight; not too heavy, well balanced, certainly not much indication of that abv.
Deeply complex, and id say, unique flavour; rich dried fruits prominant with dates, figs, apricots, sultanas, prunes. There also seems to be a fair bit of hop flavour to it with some floral notes, and earthy spice and vanilla. Malts play their hand in amongst the lengthy palate with chocolate, bread and burnt caramels lingering. Bitterness higher than I was expecting, certainly enough to balance out the sweetness.

Well worth the wait; definately one of those beers the more you look, the more you see; an experience for the tastebuds. I think my only objection is it is not nearly as smooth and luscious, and wickedly rich, as its Rochefort counterpart, which will remain my favourite, for now. Amazing beer, regardless.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"
2852,"2010-10-17",4.8,"My 1000th rate. Bottle via trade with phaleslu, thanks again Peter!!! Pours murky brown with a 1-2 finger, creamy light tan head that has excellent retention and leaves awesome lacing. Aroma is dark fruit, candi sugar, earth, mild chocolate, woody vinous notes, dark caramel, nutty notes and a touch of roast. Flavor is dark fruit, chocolate, earth, candi sugar, woody vinous notes a touch of maple, husky grain, rich caramel syrup, toasted grain, and... I ran out of beer to keep up, delicious and ridiculously complex. Palate is medium to heavy bodied, creamy throughout and has a strong, yet soft carbonation.

2852,"2010-10-16",4.2,"A bottle I received from the generous Bert in a beer trade. When opening the box of goodies the last one I pulled out was the Westy 12 and I was completely floored. I enjoyed this one with company for a special occasion. It poured a dark hazy brown with a medium tan head that simmered down to a thin film. The aroma was sweet, dark malt fruit shine. I think raisins was the only flavor I could pick out, though it was much thinner than I expected. Fine perfect bitterness in the finish. There is nothing wrong here that I can see. It is not my favorite style of beer but Im hard pressed to find anything wrong with it at all. Bert you are the man!!! Thank you! (months later)","Jersey Shore, New Jersey, USA","Bonster"

Unique and wonderful aroma with dough, spice, sugar, caramel, dark raisin, and some more subtle smells I cannot place.  Smells very inviting.

Let down? That didnt happen.
A: Medium dark brown with decent head. 
S: From the moment the bottle was cracked open...the aroma was so strong, it filled the room and made my mouth start watering. Very strong Belgian strong dark ale/quad smell. Lots of dark sweet malts and fruits. A slight wine smell on the backside.
T: Just like the smell. Very complex. Tons of dark overripe fruits, sugars, slight booze, smooth.

Would like to try a full 330ml bottle.","HORNSBY, AUSTRALIA","rbichy"
2852,"2010-10-04",4.1,"Bottle from bierkoning, thanks man. Pours a dark reddish brown, a thin offwhite head fades fairly quickly. I served this pretty cold, so at first the aroma was kind of mellow. Vineous, grapes, some bready yeast, dark fruits like figs and pruns. Some vanilla and wood. The problem was that when it heated up close to room temp, it still didnt go all boom with aroma or flavour. What happened was that the alcohol started to show way more, and it was a bit sharp in the finish. As most strong belgians, this is overcarbonated in my opinion. Still, this is a good beer. Would like to try more times to see if my bottle was a bit off.","Årnes, NORWAY","Kestral"

2852,"2010-09-22",3.8,"Bottle from a great BA digita7693. Cap 16.2.13
bottle share with a good friend that is a home brewer and great BA as well.

Pours like a carbonation bomb. I hate waiting 5 minutes and pouring 5 times in order to try a beer. But oh well, looks good otherwise. Pours a dark burnt amber color (once it settles and I can actually see color) 
Smells of figs and Belgian Yeast, slight flowery aroma, and also a bit wine-like. 

Taste, well this is where it gets interesting. I didnt get much out of it when it was cold so I let it sit a while. The warmer it got the more figs came out of it. The alcohol is VERY well hidden. cant detect much alcohol at all. The flavors do dance around on the palate, and is very complex as well. not sure if they blend all that well, or that this is really worth the hype, but it is a good beer. Still way too carbonated for me, and the entire time I was drinking this I was swirling it out. mouthfeel is diminished because of that, but again, as I got down to the end, and it was warmer and less carbonated it got much better. I am not a huge fan of working my beer as I drink it, but so be it.
Not AWESOME, but it was good. i wouldnt go out of my way to try it again, but am glad I did drink into the hype machine at least once, and have another in the cellar to age and review again. But as many have said, St. B 12 isnt that too far off if not better.","Oregon, USA","crusianbeer"
2852,"2010-09-20",4.2,"Certain products and certain pieces of art have a reputation for such amazing feats of greatness that their reputation is hegemonic. I could write an entire dissertation analyzing whether such reputations are due to authentic reaction and therefore deserved, or due to word-of-mouth hyperbole (especially in the era of the internet). I could also make the argument that the title of ""the best beer ever"" is an impossibility since that title implies some kind of measurable output and a place in a factual hierarchy of quality. But the method used to judge how ""good"" a beer is is based on personal taste, not any kind of mathematical, observable performance output. If beer could be judged using a scientific process, we could simply devise a formula and plug in the numbers - in essence discounting personal taste and the notion of a beer critic would be arbitrary.So while I scoff at the notion of the ""best"" beer or the existence of a hierarchy of beer quality as a matter of fact (rather than as a matter of opinion), I still want to try beers with good reputations to experience and judge them for myself. And what better beer to do this with than Westvleteren 12 - a Trappist beer brewed by monks and sold exclusively at the monastery in Belgium. Its roundly regarded as ""The Greatest Beer in the World"" among the craft beer enthusiast community. Now that Ive had the opportunity to try it myself I can understand why some would give it that title. And while I do think its an excellent beer, its not the greatest beer Ive ever had.APPEARANCE AND AROMAI drank this beer twice - the first time I split an 11.2oz bottle with two friends. The second time I poured a bottle into a Trappist chalice. The beer looks more like red wine with a dark brown, extremely hazy body with a slightly ruby red hue. It forms a surprisingly large, frothy, beige head which never completely dissipates and leaves gorgeous lacing on the glass. The aroma is also wine-like, although many Belgian ""strong dark ales"" or ""quadruples"" tend to have this scent. Its mostly dark fruit with red grape, plum, and cherry dominating the nose with some ribbon candy notes too. Theres a perfume aroma of lavender and flowers with an underlying presence of strong alcohol.TASTEIve often found that the more highly-acclaimed a beer is, the more complex its palate. Belgian beers, especially Trappist brews, are known for being so complex that each sip is different than the one before it. Perhaps the best way to describe the taste of Westvleteren 12 would be to simply list adjectives: red wine; oak; Macintosh apple; cherry; vanilla; caramel; dark chocolate; fig; plum; bread, and alcohol.While I would say this beer is indeed very tasty and appealing, its not to the point of being absolutely delicious. The palate is not quite as intense as youd expect. The flavors begin to light up your palate as soon as they touch it with the aforementioned dark fruit flavors. The middle is noticeably dry with a slight chalky taste of malts and a touch of sourness. The finish is a surprise, though, with rich caramel and dark chocolate sweetness followed by a bitter aftertaste that lingers shortly.Westvleteren 12 is definitely tasty and complex, but as impressive as it may be, this is still not the most delectable palate Ive ever encountered. The intensity seems a little lower than it should be, with the alcohol taking some attention away from the palate. DRINKABILITYOne of the reasons Ive been slow to warm up to Belgian beers is due to their spastic mouthfeel. I was pleasantly surprised by the gentleness by which Westvleteren 12 crossed my palate. There was no peppery sensation, so the beer was quite smooth going down. However, there is a definite presence of alcohol to cause for some heat in the throat and a dry aftertaste. This is a beer youll drink in sips anyway, since youll want to savor the experience.At 10.2% ABV, this beer should be handled with kid gloves. The monks did an outstanding job of making such a weighty beer so palatable, but after one full serving I could tell I had drank a potent beer. FINAL THOUGHTSIts nice to have finally experienced Westvleteren 12 for myself, even if it did cost quite a bit to acquire. And while I enjoyed it a lot, I dont quite understand how it got the reputation of being the best of the best. If this beer were as common as other Trappist beers like Chimay, Orval, Westmalle, Rochefort, etc. it would simply be regarded as ""another excellent Belgian beer"" - which it what it is.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZKF1kX3CUQ","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
2852,"2010-09-19",4.3,"Pours a  raisin color that is surprisingly not overly dark, and it has an inviting, creamy head on top. The aroma is an intriguing combination of fresh, juicy grapes along with raisins, prunes, and yeast. The flavor is likewise interesting and complex, albeit restrained, with a subtle combination of plums, raisins, brown sugar, and a muddled assortment of other flavors that together create a delicate, dry, fruity sweetness. The super-fine carbonation tries to cover the alcohol, but the booze still shines through a little more than I expected.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","devilben02"
2852,"2010-09-19",4.4,"Bottle. Date on the cap of 08.01.11, so bottled in 2008 I believe. Pours a hazed deep mahagony reddish brown color with a slighlty off white head. Some sediment evident in the glass. A solid mix of aromas in the nose including fruit like raisins, spice, and alcohol. Also get plums in the nose. Medium mouthfeel with some carbonation that dances across the tongue. Dark fruits and subtle sweetness dominate the flavor. Some evidence of the alcohol in the taste. Pretty smooth and exceptional tasting. Other flavors that I can pick out include molasses and caramel. Nice sweetness left in the mouth after your drink.
So, how does the ""#1"" beer in the world rate? Its hard to imagine how any such beer can be #1 for me. This is a great, very smooth drinking, well made beer for sure. The fact that you can only get it from the monastery has to come into effect in where it is on the list.

The head was diffuse but present and the carbonation was slow but steady, continuously replenishing the thin head. The smell was amazing. Beautiful yeasty and sweet smell. The taste and mouthfeel were out of this world. It was smooth, I could have drank the whole thing in a few minutes but I savored it for as long as possible. Taste was sweet and pleasant.

2852,"2010-08-22",4.3,"An excellent beer, though sort of a letdown considering the monstrous hype.  Without a doubt, no beer is hyped more than Westy 12.  Ill eventually try a whole bottle and revisit this rating, but splitting one with a few others was enough for now.  Pours dark brown with ruby highlights with a great, creamy, beige head.  Great looking beer.  Aroma is weaker than expected, but it could have been the relatively small pour.  Very fruity with some bready malt notes, a bit of Belgian earth and a hint of booze.  I usually prefer earthier Belgians and was surprised by the fruitiness, but its still quite good, probably one of the best fruity malt notes Ive had, particularly in the taste.  The beers taste is intensely likable.  Its of balanced sweetness with lots of fruity Belgian yeast notes.  Mouthfeel is quite smooth.  Overall, Westy 12 is an excellent beer and I can see why its consensus rating is so high.  However, I wonder how many people would really call it their all-time favorite, particularly with similar and nearly as good beers easily available.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
2852,"2010-08-21",4.8,"Westy 12 Review


The Westvletren 12 is my 500th beer.  And it marks my passage from beer drinker to beer appreciator.  I am thirsty for more.

I chose the Westy to mark a half-thousand beers consumed not only because it is an excellent and well-regarded beer.  It is symbolic.  More than a sample of a precise chemical craft, or brewing, the Westy represents the origins of my beer hobby, and the evolution of my palate and my interest in the field of beer.  Above all, this particular bottle was a gift from the very person who introduced me to beer.  It is a gesture that I took his invitation to heart, and have faithfully pursued the hobby well after we parted to different parts of the globe.  And it is a mark of my respect for his patience in enduring my initial skepticism, callousness and thick-headedness when it came to drinking beer and taking notes.  I owe him a great debt, and I honor that debt by drinking his beer.

I took great care and attached great ceremony to reviewing the Westvleteren.  Ambient noise and smells were minimized.  Paper and pen were placed nearby, ready to receive observations and hastily scrawled epiphanies.  I cleared my head of distractions (there are many) and focused exclusively on this laughably humble bottle and its innards.  I girded myself for my Westvleteren 12.

The pour is pretty standard, even mundane.  It kicks up a light brown head, little to no lacing, and aside from a few flecks of yeast in the last droplets to fall from the bottles mouth, I have no physical evidence that this beer will be a milestone in my beer drinking career.  That evidence appears in the aroma.  I am stricken with childhood memories of happy Colorado Christmases, as an intoxicating blend of vanilla, oak, ribeye steaks, fig, and a touch of chocolate fill my nose.  It is incredible, and it is here that I first get a taste of what all the praise, writing and hype is about.  The Westy isnt hype at all.  It is credibly amazing, and deservedly loved.  And the taste fits the Quad. style Ive come to love so much.  It is big and rich, barreling onto the tongue with the same aromatic flavors that caused me to reel in my chair.  A few seconds later this boldness attenuates, exposing an undercurrent of fig and a deep, sweet red wine flavor.  And then again, moments later this layer of flavor recedes to expose a tertiary layer of molasses, oak, smoked wood and a parmesan cheese like umami.  To be short, there are three distinct layers of flavors, each of them characteristically delicious, and each a little quieter than the last.  That final touch of umami savoriness is practically a whisper, but you can still make out the words.

With all these flavors in a single beer there is a very real threat that the flavors may become crowded and muddled.  This is not the case.  The Westvleteren 12 delivers these flavors in stages, and on a perfect palate.  The beer is thick, but not syrupy, and it textures the flavors without warping them.  It is a crowd of luminaries, each in perfect concordance with the others, a kind of harmony of brilliance without egos to interfere.

By the very end of the beer I am questioning whether this is actually a Quadrupel.  It has all the basic qualities of a Belgian Strong Ale according to my taste buds, and possibly according to a rigid style guide.  But I think the Belgian Strong Ale tag might be slightly too tight on a beer like this.  The Westvletren is an expression of a style, and a permutation so fantastically brewed that it almost breaks from tradition.  These breaks are sometimes called revolutions, which would be the highest form of irony for the Westys brewers who are steeped in tradition themselves.  But they are also steeped in this beer, and they must know that what they do, they do very well.  This level of brewing is intentional, and it shows.  One need only look at the lines of avid drinkers banging on the monasterys doors to understand that there must be some authentic draw to this beer.  And now I finally realize it through a few intense sips. Ive extended a dimension of my understanding of beer and the craft beer world with one bottle of a highly-esteemed brew.  This really is a fantastic hobby.

I had this ""young"" with a 2013 ""best by"" date. 12-oz bottle poured into a chalice. Poured a ruddy-red tinged, dark brown. A moderately aggressive pour yielded a huge three-finger white head. It settled to 1/2 which lasted throughout. I sipped this beer and there was that fluffy head at the very last sip. The nose was coffee, caramel, plums, lemon, clove, and chocolate. The taste? My goodness...dark, sweet fruit (plums, grapes) with some chocolate at the start and some spices. Belgian (bready) yeasts were evident. The finish moved to dry and even a little bitter, providing a wonderful, complex and balanced evolution. Mouthfeel was thick without being syrupy. Carbonation was surprisingly high, but seemed to fit. Its hard not to gush but this is just an amazing beer. I wanted to find fault with it but could not.

T: Much like the nose, there are lots of subtle undercurrents of various dark fruits. Figs, raisins and cherries are prominent. Somewhat less sugar and caramel than is represented in the nose. The grape skin quality has trickled off and been replaced with a more boozier flavor. As the beer warms the flavors really pop out.

2852,"2010-06-30",4.2,"Appearance: Dark brown, slightly translucent around the edges. Pours with a 2-inch head that eventually settles to a quarter-inch. Very good head retention, a trait Ive noticed amongst most Trappist beers. 

Aroma: Dark dried fruits, figs, candi sugar, slight alcohol. Very aromatic. 

Taste & texture: Very fruity initially, though not overly sweet. Takes on a rum cake quality toward the middle. The finish leans more on the dry, herbal and hoppy side, though it retains a trace of sweetness. 

Notes: I compared this side-by-side with St. Bernardus Abt 12, and while quite similar, I slightly prefer this. I found it more aromatic and slightly more balanced. In contrast, St. Bernardus is a bit more dry and bitter in finish, though both beers are excellent. While I approached this with as much cynicism as I could muster, it really is great, and largely worthy of the praise it receives.

2852,"2010-06-29",4.8,"In De Vrede. Westvleteren Abdij St. Sixtus.  June 2010.  I drank this beer at the cafe at the abbey itself in Belgium.  No doubt that the surroundings influenced my impression of the beer.  If you are planning a trip to Belgium, be warned that this place is TOUGH to get to without a car.  There are no buses or trains that go directly to the abbey, and a 10 km walk from Poperinge almost thwarted my efforts... but I made it, tired and thirsty, to the cafe In De Vrede!

A. The beer came to me poured, although still from a bottle (unlike some other Trappist ales, that can be found on tap).  It maintained a head, light tan, and darker than that of the 8.  Small bits of sediment could be seen bouncing off the bottom of the glass as it bubbled (which it did with fervor).  The beer was served with the only real label-the cap.  (the picture on ratebeer.com is a post-sale label, not from the abbey)

S. The nose of this beer is strong, but not over-powering.  More depth than the 8, with more intense, not really even hints, of prunes, raisins, fermented fruits and brandy.  Underneath the formidable scents of fruit, there is a musty, woody, base.  All of this clears out of the nose and leaves hints of grassy smells, likely from the hops, used almost exclusively for preservation.

T. The initial sip instantly reveals sweetness and dark fruit flavors uncommon even among Belgian beers.  It is big, simply put.  Overwhelming flavors of syrup and brown sugar, balanced by fermented cherries and bourbon.  There is definitely heat from the alcohol, but the taste and smell are not invaded by this characteristic too much.  More subtle flavors come through after the initial shock wears off.  Wood, a little spice (grains of paradise? nutmeg?), and a clean dryness finish the flavor off.

M.  Bubbles all over my tongue swept the thickness of the beer away well.  I was plagued with the ""scrubbing bubbles"" image as i tried to sift through the carbonation to pin the taste and viscosity of the beer down.  It was difficult to do, but the beer has a syrupy consistency that is still not as thick as the flavor would suggest.  Fun, tough to grasp, and playful, the mouth feel may have been the best part!

D.  Surprisingly refreshing and fleeting, this beer was great, even on a hot and sunny Belgian afternoon.  The alcohol is 10.2%, but it did not feel anything like that (until i stood up).  It was easy to drink and doesnt want to quit, which must make it especially difficult for the monks to drink only one!  

I finished it with a dish of chocolate ice cream made at the abbey, and they paired wonderfully.  The dryness on the back end really stood out against the hedonistic sugar and cream in the dessert.  It would be perfectly at home with anything from beef stew, to grilled and saucy meat, to sweet desserts of chocolate or fruit.  A versatile and edgy beer, given the mystery surrounding it and the age of the brewing tradition from whence it comes.

Not my favorite beer, but worth a trip to its home.  Definitely in my top 10!","denver, Colorado, USA","Broke4Beer"
2852,"2010-06-28",4.1,"Pours brown/red with a tan head. Aroma is unremarkable. Mainly candi sugar, some dark fruits and a bit of mustiness.

That said, I did love this beer and it stood up very well against tough competition, and it may have been the best smelling Belgian ale Ive come across with tons of fruit and wine-like characteristics. Its delicious flavors were not as sweet as the aroma indicated and only improved as it warmed and flattened out. My only knock on this beer was how hot it finished.

2852,"2010-06-07",4.7,"Notes from a tasting in 10/08

Bottle ordered and consumed at In De Vrede, the abbey cafe.

Poured in to a Westvleteren goblet, opaque brown with a frothy tan head that left fine lace on the glass. Lots of dark fruit in the nose, ripe currant, dark cherries, run-soaked raisins...yes, it smells boozy. Some breadiness too.

In the mouth, the first thing you notice is the alcohol. Having this beer fresh, at the source, has its advantages and its drawbacks and the heat of this beer when so young is one of the drawbacks. But once you get past the alcohol up front, there is a wonder of flavors. A rich maltiness, velvety smooth and all the dark fruit comes through. Raisin, currant, plum and dark cherry, underpinned with sweet spice, a breadiness and sweet finish that is promptly made clean by the strong alcohol. A velvety mouthfeel though. Its pretty damn good.

The beer started out dry and ended up sweet, there was a good carbonation but not overwhelming.  Overall an excellent beer!

The brew has a slight amount of carbonation and leaves very good lacing when the head disappears. The aroma is extremely complex and quite sweet. Included in it is notes of plums, raisins, white wine, and a little bit of hops/spice. The taste is magical - dark fruits, light fruits, sweet malts, and a slight hoppy backbone.

It has a smooth, mellow fruitiness in its rather complex aroma. but there is also a hint of cough medicine (that I also found in an aged Rochefort 10, though much stronger in that one) that I find a little bit disturbing.

Dark, deep coppery brown color and poured with a long-staying slightly tan head.

Toffee; flavor that reminds me of a melted/reduced cane sugar; pruney and raisiny and deeply maltly. Medium MF, with a nice bubbly carbonation presence. Really coats the entirity of the mouth. Pretty insane drinkability for a quad, though it is definitely a sipper. The intriquing flavors and sweetness definitely piqued my interest and was curious to see how the brew changed as it warmed. Overall, again very glad to have tried this brew and it is indeed wonderful stuff. The flavors and warming touch of booze really provided a pleasant experience.

2852,"2010-04-27",4.9,"500th rating. Bottle cap date-15.12.12. Consumed March 2010. A murky brown beer with an amazing looking head that very slowly dissipates. I mean this head has the longest retention that I have ever seen. It took about 10 minutes for it to settle down to drink it, but the whole time it was in the glass it kept a 1 inch layer of foam. Perfection? Maybe. The aroma was like baked crusty bread, dark fruits, nuts, dash of chocolate and was quite hoppy. The taste was peppery, more baked bread, lots of nuts, raisins, other dark fruits, yeast, wood, banana and the 10% ABV is absolutely hidden. What I find so great about this beer is the fact that it is so big and has a lot of layers of flavors yet it is extremely drinkable. I hear others mention that Rochefort 10 and Bernardus 12 are just as good. But the difference between Westy and those beers is this is so much more drinkable. This has all those flavors that those beers have and more but goes down way smoother than those other fine beers. I was surprised at how hoppy it was also. I had another bottle of Westy with a different date stamped on it that was not quite as complex as this so thats what is stopping me from giving it a perfect score. I will revisit the other bottles that I have and if they age for the better then perfect 5.","San Antonio, Texas, USA","Hopper"
2852,"2010-04-26",4.7,"Review #500. Received from Raznug for as a BA Secret Santa Gift! Thought it would be appropriate to review the #1 rated beer in the world with this landmark review. Poured into my Chimay Chalice.

A- Body is a very hazy dark brown color. Pours with a minimally creamy off white head. Head subsides to a thick half-moon collar with no collar around half of it and an eggshell creamy remnants of the head in the center. When held up to the light one can see the thick, dynamic cloudiness of this brew.

S- The overall impression of the nose is slightly sweet. Raisins, figs, root beer, cola, grapes, plums are mostly upfront and have a background of slightly spicy Belgian yeast and a very subtle, sneaky alcohol background.

T-The initial flavors are exquisite and balanced. A perfect bland of spicy Belgian yeast, fig, malt, and and dark fruits such as sweet raisins and slightly tart plum mix perfectly and give off a root beer and cola-like flavor. The spicy yeast comes through a little more for the finish as well as a slight bitter alcohol bite. The flavor then turns around and ends with a sweet fruity note. A slight essence of spicy Belgian yeast lingers. Flavor is wonderful and complex.

P-Medium carbonation and wonderfully smooth and creamy body. Yeasty and smooth but with a touch of alcohol astringency.

O-This is a wonderful quadruple and it was truly and honor to try it. As far as pure drinkability is concerned; it is definitely a slow sipper. This, and other good examples of the style, IMO,are meant to be slipped slowly as you contemplate the complexity of what was produced. The ABV is quite noticeable and if you dont take your time with this brew you surely wont get a chance to appreciate it. Due to its $ and availability, its a beer that was definitely worth it for the first try/review but I will reserve obtaining it again for a VERY special occasion. A bit overrated (Its hard to be a perfect beer across the board)-but still an excellent, stand-out, well put together brew.

In the mouth is initially malt leading into deep, sweet fruit and some chocolate with sweet caramel on the back end and some alcohol on the swallow. After adding the yeast sediment the fruit character is more pronounced with a bit more sweetness. The yeast gives an earthy character in the back of the mouth throughout.

2852,"2010-04-07",4.2,"First tasted 2009-06-06 at In de Vrede at St. Sixtus Abbey, but this rating is based on a bottle I picked up at Bier Tempel in Brussels. 330 mL bottle, expiry 2011-01-22, served in a branded Trappist glass. Pours clear red-brown with a moderate, frothy tan head and large clumps of sediment. Head has good retention and great lace. Aromas of honey, yeast, chocolate, tobacco, plum, raisin, pepper and spice. Flavour is honey sweet toasted malts throughout. Against this background, flavours of pepper and spice evolve and develop. The finish is long and lingering, spicy with a hint of nut. The 10.2% ABV is well-concealed, but it peeks through in the finish. As the glass warms, alcohol becomes more prominent and the aromas become more vinous. Medium in body, with an ultra-smooth, creamy texture that is ever so slightly sticky. Carbonation is average. So, does this beer match its hype? Westvleteren 12 is clearly incredibly well made. It is complex and subtle, and perfect for moments of deep introspection. For me, the real question is how it stacks up against its younger brother, Westvleteren 8. The 12 is sweeter, smoother and more alcoholic, but also lighter in body. Both are complex and malty, with the 8 more nutty and the 12 more vinous. Both are excellent brews, but I prefer the 8 by the slightest of margins. 2010-04-07","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"

2852,"2010-03-21",4.6,"Review #600. Bottle brought back from Belgium by my wife - thanks Bryna! Served in a Westvleteren goblet. Best before February 10th, 2011, so roughly two years old.

A - Thank god! After the flat bottle I had in Toronto I was worried. The cap comes off with a hiss and a touch of gunsmoke. Pours with a voluminous two fingers of dark tan foam (impressive for a goblet!), that dissipates quite slowly and leaves glass-coating lacing and a thick cap. The body is a nearly opaque dark plum color.

S - The smell literally explodes out of the glass, with an initial wave of dark fruits and berries. Plums, prunes, raisins, black cherries - theyre all here. Theres some vinous red wine notes that emerge, along with a touch of sweet tobacco, apples, and nuts. Theres a caramel malt backbone that ties things together, but stays in the periphery. As it warms a touch of booze peeks through to remind you that this is for sipping.

T - The taste is very grape-forward, with notes of port, red wine, dark fruits, rum-cake, and caramel. Its not as saccharine as Rochefort 10, as its balanced by a dryish and slightly woody finish. While the taste isnt quite as complex as the nose, the alcohol is better hidden.

M - The body is chewy and viscous, without becoming heavy or syrupy. Carbonation is present, but soft. Finishes surprisingly dry with only mild residual stickiness. Not much in the way of alcohol heat at all. Its everything Id want in a quad, and maybe even a bit more.

D - So, is it the best beer in the world? Probably not, but its a superb one nonetheless. Its shockingly drinkable for a 10.2% quad, and I could actually have more than one of these without feeling diabetic too. Theres been a lot written about this beer, and Im not sure theres much I can add - its excellent, highly recommended, and worthy of the acclaim that has been heaped upon it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","MasterSki"

Carbonation is high at the pour, but levels off to a far lower level during the beers consumption.  The nose brings really rich characters of raisons, prunes, figs, and Munich/Special ""B"" malt richness.  Absent are the grainy and tropical fruit notes present in so many versions of the style.  Absolutely wonderful.  The palate is full without being thick, and brings a complexity that make competitors like Rochefort 10 and St. Bernardus Abt. 12 seem one-sided in comparison.  Similar notes as found in the nose, with the addition of a few that are hard to place a finger on, as well as just the right note of depth-adding alcohol.

Pours a hazy dark brown with a very thick foamy off-white head with some lacing. Aroma is delicate at first but needs some time to bloom. Vero complex with bread, licorice, spices, grass, wood, some smoke and sugar. Amazing flavor that is a roller coaster from bitter to sweet back to bitter with all the aromas bouncing happily around. Extremely pleasant mouthfeel with lively carbonation and a very creamy texture. Well worth its first place on here.","Den Haag, NETHERLANDS","Vaiz"

Tried the Blonde and 8 first (expecting the 8 to be my favorite of all three) and was a little disappointed. This, though... this is something else entirely. Almost tastes marshmallow-y. Dont eat this with something overwhelming - something bready would be perfect (I had a sandwich at In de Vrede). Its not like the other top-rated beers, in that none of the tastes are overpowering.

There was also a thin white coat over the brew with patches of spices. Mild spicy nose with some nuts and alcohol in the background. The taste was very nutty with some bitterness in the back. The alcohol is always present, but dissapears slowly. Some dark fruit and notes of coffee in the aftertaste. Smooth and creamy mouthfeel.

Well it wouldnt be Number 1 on RB if it didnt seriously kick ass, and this undoubtedly does that - in abundance.  Dense vivid dark brown colour with a liberal tan cuff. The nose makes you sit up and take notice from the off, and it kicks in that you have something pretty special sitting in your glass. Forest pine, dark fruit, marzipan, booze, malt, spices. Breath deeeeeply and inhale its a 10 - no dizzle. Slides down wonderfully well - warming with a gently prickly alco-burn that soothes like a warm blanket on a cold night.

Pours very deep brown almost black looking in the glass with a thin tan head that leaves some nice bubbles and a faint protective layer. Really wants to lace well. Aroma is outstanding. Loads of rum raisin, malaga gelato, light cognac, dates, figs, mulled apple cider. Whoa. Taste is similar: tons of gourmet dark fruits, cognac, milk chocolate, ganache, chocolate mousse, mulled red wine. A little warming from the 10%. This is seriously good. Beautiful creamy, rich palate. Just destroys all other Trappist beers. Especially St. Bernardus 12. 2/10/2010 94/9/5/17=4.4330mL 2007 ed thanks to Travlr. The pour is perfection: massive, thick, pillowy cinnamon tan head erupts with precision and towers out of the Westvleteren trappist chalice perfect poise rising straight out of the glass but not toppling over like a miracle. Massive retention and sheety, full lacing. Nose is rich milk chocolate, cinnamon, dates and figs. Taste is ultra rich milk chocolate, cinnamon apple butter, raspberry compote and ganache. Mild spicy calvados adds alcohol warm and sharpness. Effervescent carbonation and present hoppiness cut the sweetness. Very rich and aerated palate. Insanely easy to drink with less dark fruit character compared to St Bernardus 12 and more cinnamon, chocolate, and apple brandy. Awesome. 7/17/2011 8/5/9/5/17=4.4","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

Unfortunately the reprieve was not deserved, as the second tasting was much of the same. Lots of caramelised sugar in the aroma, along with wet bread, and some methanol. In the mouth it is sweet, along with tart fruit, and oranges. The heat from the alcohol comes a bit later, and then a dryness in the finish.

There are so many tastes in this beer, but all the credits certainly go to the fanstastic pallet which brings one taste after another to the foreground.

2852,"2010-01-31",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 18, 2016 Describing all the tastes that you get when you absorbing this beer is almost not possible. There are so many tastes mixed all together to a very nice beer. Even the looks are great with foam that looks like a cloud and stays for a very long time. Maybe a bit over-sweet fruity, but good moderated spices, and some nice caramel touch makes this one very drinkeable.

Edit: blindtasted on 8 july 2010 with St. Bernardus 12 (both about 9 months old). Taste was close, something different inside, but I should give both same points. Also for the looks. But the smell of the B. was slightly better in my opinion. Westy lost that battle with the smallest difference. 

Edit: Retasted both blind after 2.5 years aging. The Westy is better, but just sligthly. A bit more sweetness and taste getting trough. Its not that easy anymore to blindtaste wich one is wich beer.

Edit retasted at 31/1/2011 a bottle from 2004, more then 6 years old. Very soft fruits, raisins and prunes, spiced, light yeasty. Nice fruited. This beer can age even some more I think. Had to give it some better score after re-tasting multiple aged bottles for sure. Let them rest for a while! Retasted a bottle of 17 years old. Even this one is holding up very nice.

2852,"2010-01-25",4.6,"Oh the infamous Westvleteren 12, what to say, what to say. 
I think it goes without saying that anytime a beer geek gets a chance to try a one of these larger than life beers, its a momentous occasion to say the least. The fact that my awesome girlfriend bought this for me for Christmas off ebay, and i am drinking it in celebration of my 24th birthday kind of adds to just how kick @$$ this day is for me. It also helps that this beer actually lives up to its reputation. 
Alright, so, the beer.
Pours a dark, dirty brown with a cloudy white head. The aroma is big on black currents (wicked!), burnt sugar, raisin, licorice, red wine, cherry, and some nuttiness to round things off....amazing. The flavour totally ruins this for me, really, I cant afford to even buy one of these, but I feel like I can never drink any other beer again. Starts out big on the black currents (wicked!!), some molasses, licorice, cherry, some roasitness, ends with more black currents (wicked!!!), and more licorice. Pretty much whats in the smell is in the taste. Truly legendary stuff. Surprisingly dry finish, lightly bitter, really works. Foamy mouthfeel. Hands down one of the best beers Ive ever had. 
That being said, I would say if you have the spare cash to blow, its worth it to pay the ridiculous price on ebay to try this beer. After youve tryd it though, Its not really worth the ridiculous price anymore, it would make much more sense to buy the almost as good rochefort 10, if you can.","Guelph, CANADA","wilderthanyou"
2852,"2010-01-24",4.8,"The aroma is of sweet candy sugar; syrupy with a subtle spiciness.  Incredible off-white head - its thick and pillowy (reminds me of the foam on a root beer float.

It starts moderately sweet then gets very roasty/malty with an earthy hoppiness and a nice touch of alcohol and spice tones.  Very smooth.  The flavors coat the mouth and throat and just linger ""forever"".  This beer was unexpectedly (but pleasantly) complex and hoppy; just excellent.

The taste is intensely candy sugar sweet at first and mellows as it moves back until you get some dark bread, yeast, citrus, and floral tastes.  It finishes drier than you would predict and also has a thinner mouth feel than other quads.  Its a very nice beer but I think that the Trappistes Rochefort 10 has a better flavor (although this one has a better aroma).  I have not done a side by side and they have a lot in common - but the 10 has a better balance for me with a more refined malt character that does not overpower.","Pennsylvania, USA","fogdoctor"

While the Westy Blonde and Extra 8 poured huge heads that almost escaped the glass, this one poured a 1/4"" head of foam, which has now disappated to just a bubbly ring, visually like cola soda. Color of body is dark brown. Aroma of dark chocolate with some brown sugars. Also a smooth backbone of dark malts. No real hop aromatics at all. Very raisiny flavor. Full mouthfeel. Carbonation can also be felt in the mouth. Interestingly, of the three this one didnt have any sediment in the bottle, while there was sludge on the bottom of the lighter beers.

2852,"2009-12-26",4.7,"UPDATED: JUN 23, 2010 Another unbelievable birthday present from jblauvs; Ive been looking for this beer since I first knew what good beer was. Pours an incredibly dark plum/brown with a super thick beige head. Aroma is out of this world- massive amounts of raisin, cherry, plum, date, almond, caramel, vanilla, and other dark fruits. Alcohol is beautifully manifested in sweet and bready concept, like a rum raisin flavor. Flavor is also extraordinary; dark fruit is abound, with lots of plum, molasses, caramel, and raisin, but there is also a beautiful note of sweet nuts, like almond paste. The alcohol mixes in and is definitely present, but doesnt detract from the flavor in any way. The palate also conveys this complexity; the sweetness is thick on the tongue, but the booze adds a nice dry aspect as the flavor progresses into the later stages. This is the epitome of a quad; I am absolutely blown away. Top 3, maybe the best, of my beer tasting career so far. 

Second tasting 6/23/10 with sflpunk, side by side with Rochefort 10, St. Bernardus 12, and Konigshoeven Quad. Still amazing, but props to my fellow taster for noticing other good notes of leather and some bitterness that I missed the first time around.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
2852,"2009-12-26",4.6,"Massive thanks to jblauvs and fonefan. Pours extremely dark brown with a huge fluffy beige head. Aroma is bursting with amazing amounts and arrangements of dark fruit: Raisin, cherry, fig, date, grape, cranberry, plum, and port wine. Further malt character presents in the form of caramel, toffee, and molasses. Yeast character is bready biscuit dough. The malt character is some of the most complex and pronounced that Ive ever smelled. Flavor explodes with sweet vinous molasses and caramel. Dates, plum, fig, and all sorts of grape... theyre delicious and I love em! Nearly every possible malt incarnation is covered. Booze is barely noticeable due to the gratuitous sweet malt profile, but adds another dimension of its own. Palate is amazingly rich, creamy, velvety, rich, and chewy. The finish, is warming, combining alcohol dryness with sugar smacking sweetness. Im speechless.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"

Poured in trappist glass a murky brown with a pretty thin white head.  Immediately smacking you in the face is an aroma of dark fruits - grapes, figs, plums, and most of all, dates.  I didnt get much malt  but there was definitely a bit of spices in there.  Taste was about the same.  Huge dark fruit explosion.  Dates were the prevailing fruit taste in the beer.  It was smooth and had a pretty dry finish.  The alcohol came through on the palate but not in a bad way.  What an awesome brew.  I wish I had a case of this.

Nice lacing.  Not much to the aroma.  Esters, light spice, and a hint of perfume.  Flavor is lightly sweetened fruity esters and light brown sugar.  The alcohol is notiveable in the finish.  Medium body.  What I like the about this beer is that its not yeasty like so many Belgian ales.  With that said, this beer is nowhere close to being a top 50 beer for me.

Complexity is the key with this puppy, its got cocoa, dark fruits like figs and dates, and carmel but none overpowers the other.  The scent of this beer will forever be ingrained in my brain.  Pours a nice dark brown with a thin head that swirls and lingers.  Taste is also extremely complex....glad I waited to get a number of beers under my belt before diving into this.  There is toffee, caramel, a bit of tobacco, a bit of dark fruits, an amazing yeast strain flavor and once again no one dominates the rest.

2852,"2009-12-04",4.5,"MY 1000TH RATING!
Location: 33 ml bottle from NickD717 via trade, 12/4/09 


Aroma: This one has quite the nose, really complex, its got lots of complex fruitiness (plum, apple, raisin), and lots of other stuff too, some caramel, chocolate, pepper, and alcohol.  Id keep going but I think that gives the general gist.  

Appearance: The pour is a hazy brownish color with a slight red hue, just a couple of bubble around the edge of the glass (perhaps due to the bottle getting flattened)

Flavor: Taste is more then moderately sweet, a nice big flavorful beer for sure.  You can really feel all of those different components that make up the nose.

Palate: Its hard for me to give a great judgment of the palate due to the beer being quite flat, but it does have a very nice mouthfeel and a semi-full body

Overall Impression: 
So the hype is here for sure, and I couldnt help but save this one to be number 1000.  Thanks to Nick for hooking me up with this rare treat!  You were correct my friend, the bottle does appear to have gotten a little flat, but all the wonderful components seem to have survived.  When I opened this bottle, zero choirs began singing, my life didnt change, and I didnt find the meaning of life, but I did find one heck of a beer.  One of the more complex and enjoyable beverages I have ever had the privilege of enjoying.  Anyway, Im excited this was the beer I used to mark off my 1000 rating on Ratebeer.com.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

2852,"2009-12-01",4.4,"11.2 ounce bottle, brewed in 2009.  Pours mahogany, semi-cloudy, with a medium tan head that leaves only a little bit behind.  Awesome aroma of dark fruits (plum, date, raisin, fig), caramel, malts, spices, and faint alcohol.  The flavor lives up to the nose, with the same dark fruits, caramel, and malts, as well as mild spices, nuts, wood, and warming alcohol.  Medium bodied, really smooth, and alcohol is pretty subdued for being 10%.  Its hard to find flaws in this one- maybe the body is thin for the style, and the color isnt the most beautiful shade of mahogany.  But those are just tiny observations that mean virtually nothing compared to this beer as a whole.  I never thought this could live up to the hype, but it absolutely satisfied all expectations.

2852,"2009-11-28",4.2,"Bottle from BelgianBeerGal - thanks Amy! So this was probably the first beer that I was almost nervous to drink. Ok, not nervous, but I was very aware that this is the holy grail of beers and I really wanted to do it justice. Because of the hype I wanted to make sure I didnt overrate or underrate it--just drink it and give an honest opinion. Contrary to popular belief, angels didnt sing and monks didnt chant upon opening the bottle. I poured it into a Duvel tulip, and it formed a nice foamy tan head above a cloudy caramel brown pour. The nose was a little sharper than I expected (though it is 10.2%) with bready cherries and a bit of sharp booze. The taste, however, was fantastic, complex and lasting. Its yeasty sweet bread on one sip, syrupy, caramel sweetness the next. Tried to pick out what I was tasting, but it was hard. Found some cinnamon, honey, faint chocolate, and some lingering yeasty breadiness after the sip was long down my throat. Its smooth as hell, pretty chewy, and just coats the glass. Theres a touch of sharpness on the finish, but that doesnt detract too much. While it wasnt a religious experience, it was a fine beer that Id love to lay down for a couple years.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

In the mouth: bread, caramel, light cherry, finishing into darkchocolate/coffee, nuts. A perfect level of carbonation leaves the mouth warm and tingly. Not sweet, not bitter...excellent balance.

The sweet maltiness of the initial nose gives way to a dry grain flavor that becomes the flavor of dates and currents (my wife identified the currents). The next taste is cherry hints and chocolate, and the finish remains dry and clean. This beer is true and complex, dynamic and a very happy experience.

2852,"2009-11-01",4.4,"Appearance: A deep reddish brown color, nearly opaque. A nice looking beige head of about 3 cm with good retention leaves plenty of lacings.

Smell: A deep and rich smell. Plenty of fruity aromas (cherries, plums, overripe strawberries), raisins, wet wood. The malty backbone is thick and ""dark"" and is accompanied by a prominent spicy aroma. A hint of yeast. The alcohol is noticeable, but very integrated with the rest of the aromas. A great smell.

Taste: The taste is nothing but fantastic. A noble and rich malty backbone and semi-sweet cherries converge with a prominent, but not very strong, taste of alcohol. At this point, the beer is quite reminiscent of a fine liqueur. Hints of chocolate and coffee. Raisins adds another sweet component. Earthy yeast and spices balance the massive sweetness. Faint nutty aromas, and perhaps just a minimal hint of tartness. In the finish, the alcohol is very noticeable and has a sweet and warming character. But the alcohol is very well integrated and suits the beer nicely. The finish is slightly bitter with notes of spices, iron and grass.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied with a velvety smooth texture. The rather high level of carbonation is well suited for the overall character.

Drinkability: What to say about this legendary brew? Well, I think its almost as good as its reputation say it is. Its just unbelievably tasty with an impressive complex character. This one comes really close to perfection.

Bottle code said 23.06 which we looked up and I believe it was a 2007 batch.  Cola brown with a tiny lace and tiny ring.  The nose was musty and sweet.  Sweet tea and cola or something.  Interestingly, although the head was tiny, carbonation fizzed on the side of the glass when tilted, and it was super fizzy carbonated in the mouth.  I dont recall having that happen with any other beer.  The taste has the same effect as the nose, but with a lot more going on.  Sweet, to sharp bitter, then finally a pungent funkiness.

Aromas are a nice warming sweetness, caramel and toffee, a touch of toastiness, nuts, dried fruits, raisins, a touch of marmalade and candied fruit that contribute to the sweetness, Belgian yeasty spice, candy sugars, a touch of anise hidden underneath, a warming alcohol feel, biscuits, maybe a faint touch of cough syrup. Initial is lighter on the palate than expected, nothing overbearing or cloying, a nice sweetness and warming alcohol lightly dance on the back of the throat, caramel and toffee, Belgian candy sugars, raisins, prunes, cherry cough syrup, a touch of chocolate lingers underneath with a touch of anise and Nyquil. The yeasty spice is lighter than anticipated, instead taking on a more dominant fruitiness, medicinal quaiities. Warming, a touch of vanilla, this beer is more subtle as you move on, and the strength lies in the fact that there is nothing cloying about it, despite possibly being led to believe it would be so on aroma. I had a bit higher hopes for this, but it is still a top shelf beer, winning points for me for not being a cloying mess. Cheers.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2852,"2009-10-05",4.1,"A very complex and wonderful nose of dough, plums, chocolate and alcohol. Taste is of nuts, raisins, dried fruit, yeast, sugars and marzipan. Finish is pretty alcoholic. Maybe I should have aged this a bit longer - sampled young this is a good abt, reminicent of the 8, but the alcohol and the marzipan takes over too much (much like the young quad from La Trappe). For now, I have to say that the 8 is better.","SWEDEN","LanceUppercut"
2852,"2009-10-04",4.3,"Strong notes of biscuit, dates, prunes, and candied concord grapes ... there is also a strange spiciness that I cannot place.  Deep golden brown body with slight, eggshell head.  Nose is unveiled in the taste, but also brings fruity esters and that ephemeral phantom spiciness that is so intriguing.  Sublimely smooth and perfect for savoring.  Surely a fantastic brew, and undoubtedly one of the best quads out there.  Although the ghost-spice entices unequivocally, and in the understanding that I may induce grief amongst my brew-brethren ... I do believe I might have to prefer a St. Bernardus 12 for my go to quad.  True brew enthusiasts must try this one, it is a gem of the brewing art!","Wilderness, WA, USA, ","brewolf"

2852,"2009-09-16",5.0,"Acquired this legendary beer on eBay. 
I cannot go into detail on just how great this brew is, as words do not seem to do it proper justice.

In my opinion it was simply awesome - in the original, undiluted sense of the word. It left me pondering which little details would refine a beer to this level, the myriads of processes behind its making, and its journey from the abbey to my apartment in Bergen, Norway. 

The Westvleteren 12 is so balanced and fine-tuned that a traditional dissecting analysis of its contents seems only to disenchant the entirety of the tasting experience. Thus, I can only describe it in the ways of an entity, a combination of flavor, aroma and palate so tightly interwoven that it seemed to represent a different tactile sense altogether. The only keyword that has stuck in my mind in hindsight is: honey. And I like honey a lot. Particularly when it seems to have been gathered on clouds by angelic bees, sifted with stardust and filtered through the Pearly Gates themselves.

Am I going over the top here? Indeed. But it feel sooo goood to find a beer worth doing it for. Much praise goes out to the monks of Westvleteren Abdij St. Sixtus; you do seem to have attained a closeness to the Divine after all.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

Poured this glass while watching Craig Ferguson to add to the awesomeness. Smells of the most perfect grapes. A nice thick scent that is fruity and sweet. Nice! Tastes of about the greatest Welchs grape juice I have ever had. Not bitter but beautiful. Fair amount of raisins with a finish of satisfaction. There is not much more that can be better about this.

While this is a very good beer, its not the best Ive ever had -- in fact, I preferred the 8 even more!

Dark brown murky pour with light edges.  Thin cream-colored head fought hard to stay alive after a year-long journey from the brewery to the Midwest.  Lots of fruit in the nose, from bright green apples to dark plums and some fig, tons of a caramel, and a whiff of booze.  Flavor is incredibly sweet, with raw sugar overpowering the nice caramel and toffee undertones.  This sugary sweetness is absent from the 8 and made it a better beer in my eyes.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","bblack99"

The alcohol is well hidden in the aroma. Nice pungent fruit aroma. Nice candy/fruit taste. Very smooth. The carbonation is not ridiculous; for this reason I give this beer a perfect palate score of 5. I am telling you one of the smoothest beers I have tried. Very nice dark fruit flavor. Fig taste with some yeast, and sugar sweetness. Very nice brew. I thought this beer might have been overrated, but I must say the score is quite in-line with its rating.

Appearance : Clear dark amber with big foamy off-white head. Some lacing.

Aroma : Big rich nutty notes with red fruits. Great belgian yeast. Light raisins, Light chocolate, light hops. Utterly complex and elegant. Light banana bread notes maybe.. first time I get this I think...

Palate : Carbonation is very fluffy and lively. Never agressive and gets smooth when you swallow.

Taste : Nutty and yeasty. Great fruity notes with light caramel. Finish is rather bitter with nice alcohol warmth. Finish is quite nutty with bitter hops, light chocolate, light caramel, lots of yeast. Brown sugar. Light raisins maybe. Light banana bread on finish.

Overall : Wow this is so complex and so elegant. Mouthfeel is perfect. I think head retention was slightly better on my last bottles. I really dont think theres another Belgian brown ale like this one. So complex, so mellow, so elegant. Its my third bottle and I still think this is the best of the style. I really dont think Rochefort 10 or St-Bernardus 12 is better than this. Rating stays the same... damn this is good.

Bottle from a random restaurant in Belgium and from Cafe in De Vrede. Pours deep mahogany with a creamy expresso like head. Great lacing and very long head retention. Aroma is red fruits, hints of nuts, raisins, vanilla, oak and dried prunes. Taste is a tiny bit bitter with a spicy ending. Hints of red fruits, vanilla, cherries, chocolate and some hops but really in the background only. Some nuts also. Finish is dry and sweet at the same time. Quite warm but not much considering the alcohol. The first few sips were a bit disappointing (considering its reputation) but it became really complex and delightful after. Carbonation is interesting. It is quite fuzzy with lots of small bubbles that tickles the back on the tongue. Very complex and balanced brew. Slightly better than Rochefort 10 and 8 to me.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

Deep dark, dark brown with a mesmerizing tan head. Full of inviting little floaties. Aroma is really really telling that this is no ordinary beer - well accented raisns, figs, charred peaches and spices galore. 

Flavor is where the beer stands above. Mild, somehow dry (?), but with well-rounded elements of everything in the nose. Raisin and leathery fruit come to mind, and the flavor lingers on the finish. Each sip followed by a berath of air brings a little different take on the flavor spectrum, and not a bad note among them. This is just flat-out one of the most gloriously complex brews out there.

Concord grape, cola nut, plum.  The beers not cold, maybe 50 degrees.  Some dark raisin, but nothing unique and nothing in the way of pinnacle.  And the sip.  Dark cherry, damp dust, raspberry syrup, and alcohol fuel.  Ive had a few moments where a single beer has changed the way i look at beer as a whole and I was expecting this beer to do that again.  Fireworks.  Its not fair to the monks.  But I really think that in a blind taste test I would feel the same way.  Nearly sticky, not as hot as the 8.  Im so thrilled to finally be drinking this.  Its a goal I didnt know I had until I started goofing around on this great website.  Thanks to Ratebeer Ive become aware of this beer and received a bottle from my Secret Santa.

2852,"2009-07-09",4.4,"Reviewed on 3/9/2009...

BBD is 12.02.11 (2/12/2011 for us Yanks). 33cl bottle into St. Bernies chalice. Out of fridge for about 10-15 minutes and breathing a few more minutes before pouring. I wanted to let it breathe a bit longer but I pop the cap and its happy to see me as it slowly froths above the top of the bottle so I pour a little bit into the chalice. The foam keeps coming so I get the rest in there.

The pour as mentioned is extremely well-carbonated and yields a slightly murky raisin brown. Active carbonation yields a 1/2-finger head in the chalice; it dissipates but leaves a wispy ginger-colored film resembling a solid Kosher rye.

Whoooaaa, camel...first impression is clove, ginger and rum raisin ice cream. The beautiful bride notices prunes and a bit of chocolate...shes spot on. Prunes definitely abound; theres a dark leather scent...even a bit of soapy plums. Very complex with a mild to moderate booziness thats carrying ginger notes and aided by the solid carbonation.

Im getting a little bit of floral soapy notes at first, followed by mild gingerbread, a little clove and then some raisins. Its amazing what 5 more minutes of warmth does for this. The floral soap veneer thankfully burns away and were back in solid Quad ground. The leathery fruitcake spices, the deep dark dried plums, dates and chocolate covered cherries bring this another level of complexity. Surprisingly austere on the finish...much more dry than expected. As the BB indicated earlier, mild baking/bittersweet chocolate emerges with warmth. Prunes, too. Still, a tad of lingering floral soapiness.

For some reason I expected a big mild spice and raisin bomb. Im really surprised at the pleasant dryness of this offering. The construction is so well-done that theres not a lot of mess left behind. The excited carbonation may indicate that the yeast in this deal may have eaten everything they could wrap their cells around. Still, that floral soapiness still lingers.

Maybe its the thought of enjoying this for the very first time but this dows go down very quickly. It definitely takes a while for that one off-flavor - the floral soap - to burn off its weirdness. Note no real mention of booziness on the taste or palate profile - after the initial rum raisin ice cream scent it simply isnt an issue. My guess is that I should probably invest in a case of this some day to evaluate over time because merely one bottle isnt enough. With many extreme offerings the flavors and notions are in your face so that theres no mistake. This treasure is definitely more subtle and takes a little more time to figure out. Great, complex construction.","Massachusetts, USA","FlyingTaco"

2852,"2009-07-07",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 13, 2009 A great big thank you to Adrian for opening a bottle of this.  I was very excited about finally trying this brew, which has achieved near legendary status.  And I must say that it is very good, but not one of the best things I have had, and definitely not worth the exorbitant prices some people are asking for it, or the #1 rating it gets in some polls. It could be that the bottle we had was a little dated, since it was from 5 years ago, but Adrian says there was nothing wrong with it.  Wonderful aroma of blossoms, plus some tang and malty sweetness.  The aroma was something special, and  the best thing about it, i.m.o.  Dark pour with a little foam.  Plain bottle.  The taste was surprisingly sweet, with a sugary, dried fruit flavor dominating, along with some cola, clove, and cinnamon.  There were some tingly hops in the finish, but this creamy, sweet ale was very much a dessert treat type of beverage.  Good, but overrated.   I am not sure what makes people think it is so superior to other fine Belgian ales.","USA","Slipstream"

This is my 400th review.  I tried this beer on June 25, 2009 at Cafe Volo in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.  Several Toronto beer bars have banded together to get several cases and sell it - and I grabbed the chance.  The beer poured an opaque dark brown with an off white head...not near as dark as the St. Bernardus or Rochefort quads.  The aroma knocked my socks off....fresh figs and plums, with warm yeast and sweet malt.  More than satisfying.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied, with mild carbonation - yet a bit thinner than other quads.  The flavour again was quite complex and full of flavours when compared to St. Bernardus, and didnt have the alcohol taste and feel I get with the Rochefort.  The bitter aftertaste was even pleasant after the sweet malt and fruit tones.   On aroma and taste alone, this is the best beer I have ever had.  Im knocking off points for appearance and mouthfeel as the beer was lighter than I was expecting.","Milton, Ontario, CANADA","cyrenaica"

2852,"2009-06-28",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2011 It poured a dark liquid with some tones of red and brown. The foam was small and left no lacing. After a closer inspection I also noticed that there where some yeast in the liquid.

It had an aroma of chocolate and something fruity, some red berries and something else which I couldnt distinguish. It was also spicey with some alcohol that was fairly well hidden.

The first sip was very fizzy. So fizzy in fact that I didnt sense any flavor at all. After waiting a bit and let the fizzyness reside a bit I started to get a better grasp of the beer and it improved allot. The flavor had nuts, chocolate and red berries. It was not as intence as Westvleteren 8 a bit smoother but I actually prefered the roughness and spices in the 8.  It was all very round and well balanced with a warm alcoholic finish.

Just found this review. Dated late June 07.
Thx Brad for coughing up the dough for this... part of the Rochefort 10, Westy 12, St. B 12, Chimay Blue cellared blind tasting night.
In 2007 this bottle was aged apx 1.25 years in the Beerium as I had a purchace date of May 26, 2006.
Poured out a thick, cloudy dark brown with an incredible amount of fine and blobby sediment and a one finger thick tan cap. Excellent wide ropy lacing (it does disappear after awhile), retention at a thin surface cover. The aroma is awesome and never weakens throughout the tasting. A bit sweet, nice mild spice (main characteristic), slight caramel and dark fruit. Extremely well balanced but not overly complex. Touch of earth? The flavour is very well blended which has made it hard to distinguish standout tastes. Very soft yeast, absolutely no alcohol, mild mild plum, slight chocolate?, minor pepper, notable malt taste, slight peppermint / spearmint ??? Ill correct myself as Ive now noticed the alcohol. Man, this stuff is softer than fresh, supple kittens that have just learned to walk. A perfect amount of super soft carbonation, medium bodied. There is a back of the mouth bitterness that is very mild. The after taste is slight spice and a hint of alcohol. Excellence in a bottle.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

A bitter malty taste with subtle sweetness. Quite refreshing with a mellow, warm subtly alcoholic aftertaste. There are hints of all kinds of things in the beer, but its less subtle and well balanced than the Westvleteren 8","NETHERLANDS","Bosskie"

2852,"2009-06-20",4.4,"Murky brown, deeply fruity ale has overlying rough & bucolic character. Very textural with surprisingly grippy palate from the assertive hop bitterness, almost grainy malts and a touch of alcohol. Underlying sweet silky deep fruit adds countering smoothness - and solid weight. LOTS of additions in this brew. So many flavors, wine fruit java-roast honey and spice. This beer is fairly big and makes itself FELT - in ways reminding me equally of barley wine and porto, but that doesnt really say it. Acceptably tough and demanding, while also soothing - will need to enjoy more samples when I travel locally in the region. Much less smooth than St. Bernardus Abt, this (Feb 2008 bottle) Westvleteren Abt is no doubt as variable as Rochefort but experience will tell me more.

Honestly the smell is what i really noticed at first and set it apart from the St. Bernadus. Very dark of course it is a quad with sediment. Flavor was fantastic cannot describe it really so many raisin, dark fruit flavors, cherry and others cannot describe in detail sorry. At first it was a bit too cold so there was a slight alcohol finish, but as it warmed no detection of any alcohol and just great feel overall while drinking. Overall a great ale id put it up against 1st in a blind taste test with a St. Bernardus 12 and i will. My recomendations drink it at a little below room temperature 70 degrees IMO.","Arizona, USA","a061183"
2852,"2009-06-16",4.3,"Was planning on ageing this for awhile but something inside just told me to drink it tonight during a nice summer thunder storm. Poured a smooth brown and settled into a darker shade of deep dark brown in the glass. The head was foamy and thick and held an almost indigo hue. As I polished off the pour, the sweet smell hit me...raisins and rum mostly. Tasting this behemoth was a stage-by-stage event that involved multiple phases and finishes. Stage 1: Lots of raisins on the taste buds, some alcohol presence felt as my whole tongue kinda tingled upon the first sips...felt really good. Finish was very rounded, slightly hoppy, and so smooth and balanced. Stage 2: As it warmed up, that alcohol became far more evident in the taste...almost canceling out all of the raisin aspects from before and introducing some kind of medicine-like feel...not unpleasant...but reminded me of vodka with its icy, somewhat metallic tone. At this point in time, the smell seemed sweeter and made me think of cotton candy and the finish had quite a burn to it. Stage 3; That burning sensation has tapered off a bit but still noticing mostly alcohol in the finish; although the balance remains stable. Stage 4: Im thinking of port now, some smoke and a slightly toasted flavour that is difficult to pinpoint. Some fruity aspects coming out to me now also...apricot, apples, grapes. Stage 5: Coming near to the end of the glass now...sad to say. More of a distinct bitter sweetness coming through in the taste...brown sugar, cloves, spice, and cinnamon. But those elements are kind of attempting to cut through that thick hazy alcohol wall and not always making it. There is a sort of tar-like flavour that I am detecting along with orange peel and a burnt coffee zest. As I downed the final drop, it kind of sent a slight shiver through my body. The monks done good again. Bottom line: an interesting beer for sure, not sure how often I could truly drink these and seems like something I could enjoy more in the dead of winter...especially around Christmas/New Years Eve. Festive, complex, and comes across more like a Belgian Barleywine than anything else. So glad I could drink this. Will try and keep my patience and age the next one properly and compare.","JAPAN","buzzoven"

2852,"2009-06-08",4.4,"After a year in my fridge, after a few near misses with this rolling out of my fridge, after staring at it for hours on end it is time to crack the westy 12 that I picked up from e-bay for a ungodly price ( cue dramatic music ). Me and beercronic finally decided it was time to drink the westies, but first we put it up against the St. Bernardus Abt 12, Rochefort 10, and Chimay blue, in a blind tasting battle royal. But doing it blind made for some interesting results ( cue suspenseful music ). It turns out for me anyway that the westy came in daed last in this blind tasting, not to say it was a bad beer but compared to the rest especially the Rochefort 10 it fell short. But enough of this on the review. Beer poured a dark, dark brown and had a minimal head just a skiff floated on top, and when I got close to the bottom of the bottle feta cheese looking chunks where plopping down in to the lake of beer. Aroma was very tasty, earth, floral notes, toffee and some very noticeable alcohol, the alcohol fit in very nicely into the aroma giving it a pleasant warming quality. Taste was yummy warm and cozy, lots of dark toffee malts, nice floral notes, warm alcohol and a nice spicy presence. Banana became more aggressive in the taste the longer I drank what made the beer smoother and took some of the edge off the alc. This beer tasted way more simple then I ever imagined it would, not nearly as complex as the Rochefort 10 but still very interesting to drink. I dont think this beer lived up to its legend that it has, dont get me wrong this is still one of the best beers in the world but I do not believe it is the best. Ill give that honor to Rochefort 10. On a side note to this story as me and beercronic where attempting to do this review I was cooking supper and forced into my bed room due to the insane Caribbean jerk chicken smell coming from the bbq, and then chased out of there into the hallway of my condo building when the three heads of garlic I was using to make homemade garlic bread started to melt are faces off.

2852,"2009-05-12",4.5,"Bottle from padrefan98, thanks a million Jon for the number one rated beer on the planet. Pours a solid dark brown with lighter brown edges and some visible floaties but due to the darkness of the body they are only visible on the outer edges. Average size foamy white head that leaves a sheet of lace on the backside of my Ommegang gold rimmed chalice. Aroma is loaded with fruit notes, dark plums, banana, plum, prunes, raisins, vanilla, slight alcohol notes, dark sweet bread, and butter soaked brown sugar. Flavor is sweet with notes of fruit, especially raisin, plum, toffee, molassess, brown bread, alcohol, Flavor was close to a 10 but the alcohol on the backend was just a little to obvious.

This beer easily has the most intoxicating aroma of any beer Ive ever had next to Dirty Horse and Gales Prize Old Ale.  Deeply rich aromatic figs, dates, fatty nuts, intense plum, light brown sugar, ending a touch bitter, I could smell this beer for weeks.   Pours a slightly murky purple amber that I remember being much darker in Belgium, very fine thin white froth on top.  This beer is pretty amazing, dark and bitter yet sweet and very easy to drink.  Tastes of bitter fruit skins, sweet molasses and very nutty, vaguely burnt brown sugar, noticeable yeastiness, plums.   Medium bodied with a medium/full mouthful, much softer carbonation than the fresh bottles I had in Belgium.  Yum.  Candied figs with great bitterness.  10.4.10.4.19 4/14/09.

The aroma is very enticing and shows hints of caramel soaked raisins, figs, and plums along with notes of cocoa, vanilla, and cream. The flavor follows with the caramel and dark fruits up front, but are then complimented perfectly by the raisins, vanilla, and rum flavors. The alcohol is slightly noticeable with a sweet warming on the back end. Medium to full bodied with a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel that feels like heaven on the tongue.

T: In one word Complex. There is so much going on here yet it seems to be so minimal. Fruit, Dark candied sugar, and earth all compete with each other to come to the forefront. None are too forward though, they are meshed together in such a perfect way. This beer is like the most wonderufl Port Wine I have ever dreamed of consuming. All of this despite the fact that you would never know this tips the charts at over 10% APV May God Bless the Monks of Westvleteren.

D: Lets be real. This is to be consumed one Chalice at a time. Cost and rareness of this beer make it a real treat to consume.

For my notes, this tastes very very similar to st bernardus 12 maybe minus some of the cola / dr. pepper tones, so i dont see where people get off saying this is way better.

The aroma is somewhat fruity (cooked apple) and dry with a sweet, but not over-powering maltiness (not really caramel or toffee).  To be honest, the aroma leads me to believe that this bottle is slightly oxidized, but that might be okay...  Interesting.  The flavor is both dry, but sweet and both fruity (raisin, date?) and moderately malty.  Interesting sugary flavors, berry-like, and moderately malty.  There is an interesting spicy quality in the finish that is similar to that of a Pils.  Sightly dry finish.  The alcohol is there, but is not overly obvious.  The body is medium-light, with a medium to high level of carbonation.  This is good, but I think I am lacking the necessary palate to truly enjoy this beer...

So, in those unusual surroundings, I poured myself a glass. It is dark and thick. Its flavour is immense. Very complicated. It goes one way, then another, then another, as it slips down your throat, all good. Its hard to describe the flavour. The closest thing I could think of was jagermeister.

The malty chocolate notes are the first thing that takes my taste buds on a ride along with some of the deep fruit notes I got in the aroma as well.

Appearance: Dark brown color. Great head, beige, rocky, with good adherence at glass and very lasting.
Aroma: complex-ripe fruity aroma, several fruits in my nose like, plums, cherries, prunes, figs..... Underlying caramel notes, vinous and with reminiscences of tart and marmalade.
Flavor: vinous profile and caramel malts in the start, that vinous touch never disappear and remember me a carmenere and, perhaps, a sweet rose. The fruitiness is even more complex that in the nose with the same reminiscences as well of cassis, blackberries and semi-fermented red apples. Woody touches and a very slight hot note similar to chocolaty tobacco. A lot of secondary notes like marmalade, roasted sugar, vanilla and lightly is possible to feel the hops given even more balance.
Palate: medium to full body; semi-oily and silky texture. Low carbonation.

An immediate rich, bready aroma wafts from my glass as I pour this beer.  This beer is topped by a light brown head that sits atop a brown beer.  There are notes of sherry, plum, and raisin (though the raisin is definitely the most dominant aroma) in the nose.  The beer smells sweet & rich as well.  Well the taste is fairly rich & sweet; there is lots of fig and plum notes, which are joined by a woodiness that is in the taste as well.  This beer was an awesome way to finish my great dinner at the Hop Leaf.  There is an astringent complexity to this beer that just brings it to a whole other level, and there is a slightly musty character that integrates well with the rest of the flavors.  I can fully understand why many consider this a world class beer.  I really like how this beer is quite fruity in both the aroma and in the taste.  The alcohol is very well hidden here, I cant really detect it at all.  The rich sweetness is very conducive to being an after dinner drink.  This beer is like a rich, dark, sweet traditional German bread.  What makes this beer so good is that it is extremely well integrated; absolutely world class.

A vigorous pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a two-finger thick, creamy, tan colored head.  The beer is a dark, concentrated amber color that when held up to the light shows that I poured quite a bit of the sediment from the bottom of the bottle into my glass, but is also a hazy, bright cherry color.  The aroma smells of spices and fruit with a rich, caramelized maltiness to the finish.  Aromas of fig cake, brandy soaked fruit cake, some marzipan, clove, dried cherries, white pepper, candied ginger form the bright aromatic notes.  There is a nice backbone here of must and damp earth, as well as some toasted malt character that provides a biscuit malt aromatics.  Some higher alcohols provide a bit of spiciness as well as some warming character to the tail end of each draught of the nose.  This has quite a rich nose to it, both the fruit and spices accentuate the perceived sweetness of the aroma.

Up front this beer is a bit lighter than I expected, as it rolls across my tongue though it starts to pick up a viscous richness and heft, though it still maintains the drinkability that I like to have in a strong Belgian ale.  The beer has a definite sweetness (though not as much as the aroma might have suggested), but finishes with a spiciness that helps to dry the palate out.  The beer is a bit carbonated still after the vigorous pour and it provides a prickly carbonation as it rolls across the tongue.  fruit notes of prunes, musty figs and raisin are brought out by a touch of tartness as well as the sweetness in this beer.  There is a definite mustiness to this beer, it is oxidation character that it has picked up over the years, and it mixes nicely with the spiciness in the finish.  Speaking of which, the spiciness provides notes similar to white pepper, clove, a nutmeg like bite, some woody ginger and a touch of menthol in the long finish as well as some bitter cocoa.  This definitely gets more complex as it warms up from the high 40°F (~8°C) that it started out at.  The alcohol in the finish combines with the fruitiness to reminds me of Brandy.

Well I had a bug dive bomb this beer, so it must have though there was something worth drinking in my glass (one of my dogs got a tasty, Westy soaked morsel because of that).  While this beer is quite good, I am quite disappointed in some ways.  I havent had this in a couple years, and I am thinking I need to try a fresher version to see if it is more like my memory of having this in Belgium and at the Hop Leaf (where I had it last).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2852,"2009-01-29",5.0,"UPDATED: APR 15, 2009 After the primarily overripe banana flavor of Rochefort, and the many comparisons Ive heard between it and Westvleteren 12, I wasnt sure what to expect--a distant relative, a first cousin, or a twin. After my tasting, I think only a fairly young and unrefined beer-tasting palate would judge RF10 and WV12 identical--each hit my mouth with very different flavors. Met some nice fellow Americans in Belgium at the abbey today picking up their orders around 3PM; wish we couldve hung out. Exclusive rep of the beer didnt mean much to me compared to the simple friendliness of the seller and overall good spirit around the Vleteren area, but I think the rep is absolutely deserved. Nose is similar to Kasteel bruin, and both beers are sweet, but the flavor of Westvleteren is oh so much riper and deeper than nearly any beer Ive had... leather, vanilla, burnt caramel, licorice, slight butter, faint coffee, soft cinnamon spice and figs and apricot, with some smoky oak. I could swear I even taste a hint of caramelized witloof, that bizarre and wild acquired-taste vegetable which is the signature of Belgium. (Discounting brussel sprouts, which I really cant stand.) Mouthfeel is marvelous; so velvety and rich that its like butterscotchy liquid angora. The dark anise aftertaste is almost not bitter at all, yet it dances a waltz with your tongue long after youre finished. The moment my glass was empty I was dying for another. The only other beer I can think of thats as complex as this is the far more bitter Storm King Stout, from Victory. So what is the best beer in the world? Youll really have to try all the best-rated ones to answer the question of what suits your personal preferences the best, but Westvleteren 12 is truly marvelous, and definitely worth the test if you can get your hands on it.

Nice.  The flavor starts with brown sugar but becomes tons of dark fruit like dates (strongest) and prunes.  Its sweet but just enough to make the light residual sugar shine. It is in no way cloying.  A touch of yeast in the finish.  Mouth feel has plenty of carbonation but it is also oily.

hazy auburn brown pour with a monstrous tan head. cinnamon cream colored yeast hits last and creates little designs in the fluff.

very vinous aroma changes every time i go back for another sniff... white wine, brown sugar, milk chocolate, malt powder and vanilla all show up. 

the palate is quite spicy and has a ton of yeasty bitterness... earthy, woody, real maple syrup, concentrated malt powder and lots of chocolate chip cookie dough flavors. pleasant perfume before the dry spicy finish. it*s only mildly sweet though dry at the same time. medium body seems a bit thin considering how much is going on, the abv% and how NOT sweet it is. creamy texture is rich in the mouth but not heavy.

i really enjoy the balance, alcohol and complexity yet the sugar level is kept low making it crazy easy to drink and enjoy. sure it smells alright and tastes ok... but it*s the whole package that makes it great! now i*m ranting and at a loss for words...

Blind tasting (alongside St. Bernardus Abt, Rochefort 8 and 10, and Chimay Blue)
Deep reddy brown, creamy beige head. Grainy aroma, not as sweet as other dark trappists. Maybe it is even dry and a little woody. Soft carbonation, velvetty in the mouth. Some warming alcohol. Almondy bent, and the bitterness appears to come from the almonds. Some graininess and almost huskiness in the body, and liquorice too. Lovely hops in the finish. Adding the yeast, the liquorice builds, and over time the lovely buddy hops come over more.
3.9, but came equal 4th (with St. Bernardus Abt) out of the 5. Yes, this is a fantastic beer, but looking at most peoples comments, their numbers are complete bull inflated purely by the rarity of the brew, and by the fact that they already know in advance what the beer is.

Pours a hazy brown color with a wicked complex aroma of dark fruit, cinnamon, spice, apple, malt, candy sugar, and yeast presence. Flavor is very similar with a nice lively sugary finish.

Thanks to cigarcitybrew. Finally, got to taste enough of the holy grail of all beers to write a review. Does it really live up to its name.
It is a great beer, none the less, I would not give it the credit of being the end all be all of all Trappist beers. However, it does deserve a high spot on the podium of wonderfully crafted beers.
Pours dark brownish with white head.
Aroma is delightfully fruity reminded me of the crisp fresh apples and yeast.

A complex vinous character with hints of spice adds even more depth. Medium to full body and medium carbonation, slightly syrupy, but rich and creamy, lingering pleasantly on the palate. Flavor reflects the vinous aroma with dark fruity sweetness dominating. A very gentle spicy bitterness arrives late in the game, but still balances well.

2852,"2008-10-23",5.0,"This beer has a sterling reputation, which I assumed was unearned.  Its not.  Granted much of its cache is due to its scarcity, but that doesnt change the fact that it is world-class.

Body was a dark red-brown with creamy white head with great staying power.  Aroma was earthy, raisin-y, and distinctly cereal-y, but in a good way.  The cereal-y of this and the other Westvleteren beers I tried had this underlying aroma that reminded me of the boiling mash smell that permeates the brewery when a boil is going on.  Flavor is a bit like baking bread (that same malt-mash flavor) with raisins and a touch of sweetness and a noticeable alcohol tinge.  Very balanced.  At the top of the page, my notes say ’Honestly, this is perfect.’

2852,"2008-10-18",4.8,"With great anticipation I poured the beer from the bottle into a trappist glass.  The aroma was a highly complex blend of deep and dark fruit scents.  The most noticeable notes were those of raisin, plums, prunes, and some other figs.  There was also a hoppy component, with some citrus tones, including a touch of grapefruit, and a grainy-earthy hop part; maybe a bit of wheat, and late-emerging toffee notes.  The beer had a rich, dark brown color, with the slightest tint of dark copper.  The head was a bubbly-foamy off-white/light tan color with a very big size initially.  It lost its big head in the beginning, but leveled off to maintain a thin layer on top of the beer, with creamy edges., which remained until the end of the beer and left a lot of clingy foam on the glass.  I was worried I might be disappointed going in for the first sip, but far from it... the flavor explodes in the mouth almost immediately.  The first flavor to hit the mouth is probably the raisin-plum taste, with some sweetness, folllowed by a good bit of sour-bitterness.  As it warmed a bit, some of the grainy-earthy flavors came forward; there was also a toffee malt effect in the taste.  The beer has a hugely lively fizz feel along with the flavors, and leaves the mouth feeling full from even the smallest sip.  It has a thick, lasting effect, and the alcohol content pokes through from time to time.  The body was smooth and wet, yet still left the mouth feeling slightly dry.  Before having this beer, and even in the first moments, I was worried that it would not live up to the hype... but it did.  While the aroma and appearance were great (especially the retention of the cling and head), it was the flavor and palate feel that truly separate this beer from the pack.  I have never experienced such a burst of flavor coupled with a majestic palate feel before.  To date, this beer is the best that I have ever had, and in my opinion, deserves its status.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Derek881"

Poured a rich, dark brown color into a chalice. However, when the light hit it just right, it had a deep ruby/garnet glow. Wasn’t a huge head, but stayed around for a while. Also, we were sharing this among several people, so pouring this bottle into multiple glasses may have affected the head size as well.

Aromas were good, but nothing really stood out. Rather fruity, like plums and brown sugar, with some sweetness as well.

The taste was excellent. Lots of dark fruits, honey, some spice, and also a bit of alcohol bitterness.

Mouthfeel was exceptiona, like drinking velvet. Just a tingle of carbonation to keep the palate fresh.

2852,"2008-10-02",5.0,"Bottle at Kulminator in Antwerp. It’s been a few months, but this beer stayed with me. Thought I would never find this bar, but a local took me after Holland beat France in Euro 2008. To the beer. Pours a very rich mahogany-brown with a yellow-beige head that lacks no staying power. Lacing was fantastic, but no better than the 8. Nose was of earthy fruits, figs, prune and raisins. Akin to a fine port but so much better. Flavor starts with rich fruit and spice with noticeable yeast. I paid a little extra for the 2006, so the alcohol settled a bit in the finish, but it was still there. This was my first experience with a Westy (We had the 8 too) but it met all of my expectations, and considering the setting, it has been the finest beer experience of my life to date.","Costa Mesa, California, USA","Moosington"

Dark fruity aromas, candi sugar, and a cool alcohol bite in the nostrils.  Heavy bodied smooth on the tongue and cool tingling carbonation.  Amazing dried fruits has a tart maltiness and even a pretty good hop/bitter malt bite.  This potion envelops the tongue and will linger forever.

2852,"2008-09-29",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2010 Aroma is wildly delicious - sweet figs in honey, toffee, an immediately noticeable vinous presence, rum sugars, candied dates.  A rich, fresh maple syrup is announced.  Pour is deep chestnut brown with a small, cobwebby beige head.  A highly-anticipated first sip.  This has the round, chewy malt of St. Bernardus 12, but has a richer fruit presence and is more refined.  Creamy, wonderful mouthfeel.  Just beautifully balanced and well-crafted.  As with Rochefort, an impression of overripe banana makes itself known.  This is fucking amazing.  A brilliant spicy note, like cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom swirl about the dark fruits and rich, deep alcoholic sugars.  I dont know if Ive ever enjoyed a bottle of beer this much.  If my tooth wasnt hurting I probably would have enjoyed it even more.  Thanks Brad, I owe you.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
2852,"2008-09-27",4.5,"A very dark brown pour, with a touch of ruby highlights. Surprisingly dark, moreso than I was expecting. A two finger head, pale tan / offwhite, nice and sticky, good retention. I was quite pleasantly surprised by the size of the head on here, especially considering the ABV. 

A ton of dark fruit, sweet candi sugar scents, almost caramel like, too. A smoky, and woody quality, kinda oak like. 

Sugary dark fruit... A very notable raisin, fig, and date flavour. A warm, alcohol flavour... A little sweet, a little tart, a little peppery/spicy. A nice earthiness, smokiness, leather and tobacco. A lot going on, and beautifully balanced. Certainly my favourite of the trappists, and a very fine abbey ale. 

Big, rich, and round feel. A nice, fizzle of carbonation over the tongue, swirled through the mouth, and easing to soft and smooth on the finish, leaving the warmth and rich flavour on the finish.

An excellent beer, and unfortunate to only have one bottle. It drinks incredibly smooth and soft, with an excellent sense of satisfaction after a glass. It has certainly secured a place among the best of the best, and well worth seeking out to try.

2852,"2008-09-16",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 16, 2009 Drinking at my home, in a Trappist Westvleteren goblet. Both the beer and goblet were purchased a De Bierkonig in Amsterdam.
Nice smell. A little bit of natural vanilla and some figs. Its a very sweet smell. It gives you a good clue as to the sweet taste that is to come.
Not too hard hitting like some of the other stronger Belgians out there. Im suprised this is as drinkable as it is. I could drink a few of these. 
The carbonation is nice and bubbly, but fades rather quickly. The immediate taste is of sugary figs. It leaves almost a licorice aftertaste behind, that sticks around for a couple minutes after each sip. 
It is a very complex, and very sweet, flavor without being too hard on the palate.

I bought three of these at my local dormitory beersale (its an excellent beersale for a dormitory), and tasted them with two friends. Ill still say my favourite beer is Mikkeller Jackie Brown, and my friends are both still  bigger fans of Ølfabrikkens Sortøl. Yes, the aroma is very good, spicy and fruity, but Ive smelled better beers. The appearance is beautifully dark brown-coloured, but I had expected a better head from this best-rated beer. The flavor is absolutely fine; the best Quadrupel Ive tasted (though not so many), the hops is as obvious as it should be, and the alcohol is surprisingly well-balanced. The palate is close to perfect, but thats exactly it! Id expected the entire beer to be close to perfect. Not boring at all, its an eminent beer.

2852,"2008-09-14",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2010 Vintage 2002. It pours a dark brown beer with a small beige head. Good head retention. The nose is of walnuts, alcohol, grapes, wood, candy and seaweed accompanied by a huge amount of malt. Very strong. Faintly smoky with a light acidity. Complex taste. Slightly salty. Beautiful lacework. Woody. Full bodied. A lot of warming alcohol. Sweet syrupy. Molasses and rum. Hints of aniseed, raspberries, walnuts, seaweed, fennel and licorice accompanied by a huge amount of malt. Smooth mouthfeel. Perfectly balanced. Grapes and honey sneaking in. Medicinal. Alcohol showing up with the swallow. Smoky. Low bitterness and hop profile. More honey appearing after a few sips. Not much carbonation. The finish is oaky with alcohol, hints of aniseed, quite a lot of blueberries and licorice. Some residual sweetness lingering for quite a while with some reminiscent aniseed, heather and dates. Extremely complex, exclusive and unique. A great beer, but definitely far from being the best beer I have sampled, it clearly does not transcend all the others. I personally definitely prefer other trappist beers. Thanks a lot Bov for giving me this Westvleteren. Will rerate soon hopefully. Okay: Here we go: Honey, earthy hops and almonds in the nose. Grainy. Apples in the taste which I dont really like. Overrated! Much to generous with my initial rating. Still staying with the bogus score.

This relatively fresh bottle from this year pours a lovely rich muddy, thick, dark brown color with a nice beige head.  Smell is wonderful and of raisins and dark brown sugariness.  Taste is oatmeal cookies, raisin, with light hoppiness mixed in, and a slight yeasty sweetness.  Very balanced still and not too malty at all.  Very balanced and a fantastic beer.

2852,"2008-09-10",4.8,"Cap dated 29-04-06: I had intended to not drink this until I found another, but that may be awhile. Besides, this is my 100th beer reviewed. 

Into the requisite tulip it goes, with some effort needed to coax a slight foam, I wouldn’t even call it head. When held to a light source, the body is a beautiful cherry amber, clear save for a small number of floaties. The nose is a luscious blend of dark, dried fruits, and some wood. 

The taste is completely blended, there are no layers of individual flavors. The initial flavor is kind of sweet up front, but quickly begins to dry out. The woody, or perhaps leathery, character appears, and then a faint bitterness, as if from hops. The mouthfeel is barely carbonated, but silky smooth, and heavy. I drank three of these the last night of Marvin’s rule over Chalkies. It is to him that I owe many thanks for this bottle. 

I think that in Europe, the second number of the date represents the year, rather than the third, as in America. And I seem to remember reading in one of the forums that Westvleteran 12 is bottled three years before the date on the cap. As good as this was, I would like to try a slightly fresher sample. And my two cents is that this is head and shoulders above all other Quads, Trappists definitely included.

The aroma is rounded out with some big, bready yeasty aromas atop a fine malty base. Truly a magnificent aroma. In flavor, sweet dates, bready yeasts, spicy hops and surprisingly had a bitter finish.

2852,"2008-09-04",4.8,"A rich earthy brown, she pours delectably into my glass, a goblet of course. A generous body, she is a deep earthy brown leaving no room for light to peek through. Thick and luscious in my glass with a nice tight, tan head which fades into a light ring around my glass. Much yeast in the nose with fruits such as prune, fig, and raisin. Westy is thick, heavy, and meaty in my mouth. A light touch of effervescent which I find is typical or bottle fermented Belgian Ales, and I love it. The palate is sweet and yeasty and a blend of darkish fruits like the prune, fig, and raisin I got in the nose. The whole flavor profile seems to settle right on the center of my tongue, lingering with a hint of dryness. Like a good Belgian, Westy warms beautifully, bringing out even more of the tangy yeasty sour goodness. Westy 12 finishes beautifully, much to my sadness, because I really didn’t want this wonderful Belgian beer to end. A true Trappist quadrupel, bless those monks.

For a high ABV, Westy 12 is very drinkable, and I could easily put a couple of these away, maybe with some yummy gourmet cheeses n smoked salmon. I have had a few ""religious experiences"" over the last few years of my beer geekdom, and Trappist Westvleteren 12 is definitely one of those.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

Nicely packed carbonation bubbles stream up the side of the glass. Aroma has a strong caramel malt sweetness, candy sugar, raisin, plums, and cherries all combined together, yet no one overpowering. Reminds me of a nice cognac where you just sit and savor the complexity of the aroma. Nice creamy body. Taste is thick and malty with lots of dark fruit notes, cherry, candy sugar.

Bottle served slightly chilled in my favorite chalice. The pour produced a good two fingers worth of Brown head that goes to a great lace. The body was brown to a dark red in color 

The nose has tons of Malts and dark fruits It is a little less Intense than expected But it may be just reality catching up to expectation. There was a hint of spice and alcohol as well as it warms.

Flavors of sweet dark fruits filled my mouth raisins figs and such. As it warms more of the alcohol is present in its bite but so does the spiciness in the flavor as well .Great mouthfeel and perfect carbonation for its style

For this holy grail of all brews this was a pleasure to drink, highly drinkable. The rarity of this brew aside. I do think it is close to a few of the other Belgian Quads I have tried St. Bernardus comes to mind. Dont get me wrong this brew was better balanced in the flavor department but I think if it comes down to it St. Bernardus is a close second.

Then again, the actual beer could never match up to its rep. Even as a Belgian Quad, I’ve ended up being more excited about Delerium Tremens or Atomium. Or maybe a family gathering is a little too stressful to actually enjoy a beer. I will say: Beautiful smooth brown pour with a short head. Smell of figs, raisins and Belgian brown sugar (not too much of the latter). Taste bring out those fruits, with the added sensation of fruit leather and Belgian malts. What I realize is that this is not a great ""extreme"" beer: there is nothing going over the top for the sake of bragging rights. No, the Trappist brothers were never into that. What I have instead is a well-practiced beer that balances in almost every respect instead of overwhelming the senses.

But the most dominating smell from the beer were the dark fruits: the raisins and a sour tasting plum. The beer also had a very strong alcohol taste.
The initial flavor was moderately sweet and the finish was lightly bitter with lots of alcohol - pretty clean tasting towards the end. 
The beginning of the beer is light to the palate and ends medium to full with a syrupy texture. The carbonation is lively.
What a great beer!!!!!!!","Beverly Hills, California, USA","m4rest88"

2852,"2008-08-04",3.9,"11.2oz bottle, bottled 20.04.07--thanks to henrikb for this!  My first rating in my new podunk town!  Clear ruby brown with some chunky sediment and a one finger fading beige head down to a thin ring.  Why doesnt this look more impressive?  Figs, raisins, and sweet slightly scorched caramel lead the aroma.  Vanilla, Belgian yeast, and chocolate covered cherries come next.  Flavor has the chocolate covered cherries (with the syrup and white sugary filling) coming stronger, and the alcohol blends well with this clear into the semi-dry slightly chalky finish, with bitterness peaking around a 2 to 3.  Backing up a bit, the addition of a hint of leather makes its way into the flavor. Fairly vinous and figgy again as well.  Full body with prickly low carbonation.

2852,"2008-07-18",4.7,"So this is THE big one... ahem. Pours dark ruby/brown with billowy off-white head. I dont normally mention lacing, but this leaves loads of it all over the glass, kind of like abstract art that draws in yet another sense. Im trying to find something consistent in the nose, but there isnt one single element: loads of raisins and raspberries, then peaches, then smoky Rodenbach-esque fruit sour refreshment, then malts that remind of bread and brown sugar, then a warm alcohol that gives it an incredible depth and weight. Moving on before it evaporates... The flavor is very similar to the nose, a little more bread and dark fruit. The alcohol is really minor but begins to emerge with warmth, as do some sticky bitterness and salt. The beer is effortless in its glide and soooo smooth given the weight. The Rochefort 10 is a messy sledgehammer by comparison, but it seems unfair to place Rochefort up against this giant... are they really the same style?

Smell is a little lighter than I expected, but still plenty of dark fruits and spices, with a little bit of a sour smell detected. Taste was much of the same, didn’t really detect any sourness that I found in the nose, also I couldn’t detect the alcohol. Even with my expectations of this beer being very complex, it still caught me a bit offguard, it was very nice, nearly perfect. Medium bodied, with a light to medium amount of carbonation; it was smooth with a slightly dry finish to it. Drinkability was incredible, alcohol was not to be found and it seemed to go down just as easy as a 3.2% cask ale, I had to hold myself back from drinking this too fast. The best beer in the world?

Bottle courtesy of Shyam.  33cl bottle has no label, engraved in the glass is the word ""Trappist"", otherwise the only identifying mark would be the bottle cap.  Pours a deep, cloudy, nearly opaque nut brown with a head that was initially foamy and active, and settled to a healthy, creamy, tan ring with tight bubbles.  The aroma is mild, all things considered, but if you search you can sense the complexity.  Theres a deep, sugary malt presence, yeast, grain, bread dough, raisins, dried fruits, dates, figs and a touch of lemon grass.  The aroma is good, the flavor is truly remarkable: brown sugar, chewy bread dough, raisins, grapes, butterscotch, cookies, biscuits, Belgian candy, coffee with cream, cane sugar, a little bit of earthy spice and a little bit of mild milk chocolate.  Buttery and soft on the palate makes this so easy to drink with the kind of lingering sweetness that could make it a session beer.  What a session that would be.  Very well balanced and the consistency of the beer is probably a reflection of the care taken when making it.

Always though I would be then nervous or fascinated, but at the moment I took it as a normal beer, like every other, sincerely, without any biases. Even didnt expect too much from it, maybe of bad biometeorological situation :) Allright, lets head to the beer! I got a 0.33 l bottle from belgianshop.com. It Poured just a bit hazy dark brown body with medium bigger brownish head. Strong, impressive aroma, yeasty with dark fruits (berries, plums, ) caramel. Some orange peel as well, with caramel and chocolate. Wow, cant stand to try it now! At the first sip it seemed a bit light, bittersour caramel and some alcohol, but nice. After two or three its complexity started to show up, probably as the palate gets used to. Yeasty fruits with malty caramel produce some nice flavors, ranged from chocolate filled with blueberries to irish coffee, as alcohol is also felt a bit. Very nice, but not near perfect, somehow leaves a feeling alcohol is hidden in a bit wrong, unbalanced and I would deer to say cheapish way. Finish is very pleasant, very sweet, caramel and plum dominated. I am constantly bothered by that strange bitterness from the flavor, but otherwise would be perfect beer.

2852,"2008-05-19",4.8,"Bottle, HUGE thanks to Dough77 for sending this guy my way. Ive been saving this for my college graduation, and Im glad I let it sit for a few months before cracking it.

The aroma is so interesting - doughy, yeasty, picking up some raisin notes too. To be honest, it smelled like bread, or pizza dough (in a good way). Absolutely delicious flavor. Lots of fruit: raisin, lightly roasted coffee, some caramel, honey, and vinuous notes too. Beautiful lingering malty finish, perfect body. The alcohol is there, but just serves to warm the throat on the way down.

I was a little nervous before opening this one because I was afraid that it wouldnt live up to the hype. Fortunately, it definitely did. Its a unique and incredibly complex beer -- Im glad to have finally tried it.","New Jersey, USA","mcferc4"

This thing is like drinking pure nectar!  Figs, licorice, chocolate, raisins, and maybe a slight bit of coffee and thats just the beginning.  There are so much more complex flavors to this thing!  It is ever so slightly sweet and it lingers forever...  I now understand why they call this the holy grail of beers!  The abv in this beer is very well hidden.  You could drink a few of these things without realizing how much youve had!  What else can I say, Everyone needs to get one at least once in their life!  Only wish I had more...

Addendum: Same day I went to the Kulminator and had a bottle of 12, with the yellow cap, from 2004. Completely different from the one described above. The aroma was totally dominated by malts, cloves and spiced fruit.  The fruitiness - mainly cherry-  was still there in the flavors but malts were more prominent.

S- Smell is amazing. Deep dark fruits, raisins, hints of plum, with a deep yeasty earthiness that is hard to describe. boozy.

T- Taste is extremely balanced and minimal yet overflowing with complexity. Starts off just as in the nose with deep dark fruits, moves into a bit of an acidic bite which mingles with a hop bitterness joined with a spicy flavor. There is a deep breadiness all the way through and booziness at the end which tops it off perfectly.

M- Thick, low on carbonation and fairly dry. Lingers on the palate for a while.

D- I wanted to dislike this beer, I really really did. I told myself I would rate it like any other and try to play down the hype but it just didnt work.

This is my first taste of Westy and was an admittedly small sample in a wee wine sample glass. There was also some question as to the authenticity of the bottle as JerC remembers some discrepancies from previous samples.

At any rate, It poured a lovely dark almost roasted coffee brown with a moderate head. There was a very malty aroma with just the finest hint of chocolate coming through at the end. I was very disappointed in the degree to which the alcohol cut through the beer though. I got a faint hint of anise floating around somewhere in the background but it almost tasted like someone had spilled cheap vodka in my beer.

Flavor: Oh, good lord. I didnt think it could really live up to the hype. i was dead wrong. As you take a sip the fluffy head coats your tongue, then the beer pours over that coating and just envelopes your mouth. Absolutely amazing flavor.. Roasted hits about halway through a sip... its a smoky roast flavor in a way. Very hard to describe. Bitter dark chocolate, residual sweetness, sweet dark cherries... not sensing any tart.

Holy shit this beer is amazing... the flavor is so complex. its really hard to describe. Im actually getting some hop bitterness, but no flavor or aroma from the hops. 

As the beer is warming, theres a vast array of new flavors blooming. In the front is white and red raisons. Bubblegum? ... good lord. I think Im gonna keep all 30 beers.

I found it a bit thinner than Id anticipated, I guess a byproduct of aging.  Of particular note there was little to no head here.  But the aroma, full of grapey fruitiness, promised something special.  And indeed the rich plum, fig, raisin character was especially enjoyable.  Smooth and clean.  I think this beer does benefit from its own mythology and lack of availability, but it is quite good.  (#3358, 3/28/2008)","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
2852,"2008-03-28",4.8,"UPDATED: OCT 8, 2010 Rating #100!  Cap: 20.11.10  -  I debated whether #100 was a worthy milestone for a Westy 12, but I couldnt wait any longer damn it! I took over almost an hour and half to savor this little beauty.  

Aroma:
Nose is figs, raisins, sugary candy, toffee and a touch of cherries.

Appearance:
Pours a cloudy caramel color with some floaters.  2 finger beige head initially that fades into a constant 2 cm topper.  Lots of carbonation, though not much lacing.  The head just slides off the glass.

Flavor: 
This one is complex to say the least.  Vanilla, dried dark fruits, caramelized sugar, bready yeast, all spice.  Wow  it keeps changing like a Willy Wonka Gobstopper.  A little hoppy alcohol burn in the finish to level out the sweetness.

Palate: 
Creamy bubbly/tingly mouth feel.  Coats your entire mouth like latex paint.

Overall: 
An excellent complex Belgian. You could take a day trying to figure out the different flavors as it warms up.  A notch or two above Rochefort 10 in my opinion, but with the availability of the latter, Ill most likely stick with it rather than mail order from Belgium again.  However, it certainly is worthy of its legendary status and a must try on your list.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","Sparky"
2852,"2008-03-28",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 8, 2010 This one really lives up to its hype. I have tasted 1, 2 and 3 year old version, and the last one (vintage 2004, sampled in 2007) just knocked me complety over. It is muddy brown with a lot of sediment, and has a fantastic aroma of berries, overripes fruits, toffee and caramel. The flavours are everything at once: sweet like caramel, fruity bitter and complex spicy. Finally the palette has a history of its own, being creamy and full bodied with a lively but refined carbonation and a finish that makes you wanna fill out the application form for the trappist monastary. Heavenly silence should be the canonized words for such a grand experience.","Odense, DENMARK","Blom"

Flavor was a great balance between its fruit like sweetness and a malt backbone.  I found the flavor to be really complex.  It had a nice full mouth feel, seem to coat the palate.

Appearance: Pours a nice and clear brown color with a 1.5 finger tan head. Slightly red around the edges. There is a little bit of lacing on my snifter. This looks very similar to the Abt12.

Aroma: Starts with some dark fruits, nice malts and a slight alcohol burn. This is followed by dark fruits, figs, roasted malts, and slight cherry. The aroma is more pronounced as it warms. Very nice. Lets see how it tastes.

Flavor: The tastes are similar to the aroma, but not as noticable. Cherry and dark fruits from the start followed by warming alcohol and some spicy hops. There is a nice malt background that balances all these flavors.

Palate: The dark fruit and malt flavors hang for a bit. This is pretty creamy and goes down very smooth for 10.2%. I wish I had more than one bottle of this because I could easily drink a few of these.

Overall. This finished behind the Rochefort 10 and slightly above the Abt 12 and Chimay Blue. Another truely a world-class beer (as were the others).

We were looking through some stuff in his cellar, and I have to talk him out of opening a Kentucky Breakfast Stout, I tell him I have one that we can drink, and we should try something I dont have.  As I am messing around by the beers, he pulls something out and pops it before I even know what it is.  What is it?  A damn Westy 12...Wow, thanks man.  Poured a deep brown-amber color with a moderate beige head that eventually settles to a ring.  Sweet, fruity figs, brown sugar, and yeastiness on the aroma.  Sweet, malty entry with undertones of fig and other dark fruits (plum) that leads into a yeasty, dry finish.  Smooth, full mouthfeel.  Really an excellent beer.

Beautiful burgundy with a rich tan head. Super sweet and complex flavor, with hints of dough, cake, and dark fruits (prunes, dates, cherries). Very creamy and full, just a tad cloying. World class for sure, but tends to be over-hyped a bit. Is it the limited availability that gives this one its huge reputation? Or is it the taste?

Mildly tannic but sweet, almost port-esque.  Taste is insane.  Fruity notes play with the tongue offering up intertwining hints of cherry, grape, raisin and plum which compliment the caramel and toffee of the malt.

I think my beers have seen better days. Poured a bit cold-could be an issue. Small flat head and very dark brown-almost opaque. Nose is a bit alcoholly, chocolates, caramel.  Thick, syrupy mouth. Alcohol is present but tons of syrup, chocolate, raisins, prune. The flavors stick to the palate as the warmth creates more flavoring.  Still, I would believe this is a beer best drank fresh at the brewery (or across the street).  The 8 was almost perfect.  I didnt have the 12 because I had a case in the trunk of my car.

The flavor is just as complex as the smell. Plum, rum, chocolate, fresh bread, grape, pepper, vanilla, again I cant possibly do this justice. Unrivaled.

My final beer at the end of an intense day, and I wasnt taking notes, but Ill try to remember my impressions. I do remember what I thought of it in comparison to some other beers that Ive had, so thats largely where the rating comes from. My most memorable impression of it is its light body compared to other beers of the same and similar styles, yet its ability nonetheless to maintain its complexity. Definitely some molasses coffee notes, I got some honey notes as well amidst the more typical vinous dark fruit body. Im not sure if I would say the beer is overrated, if I was just expecting too much, if it was the end-of-day placement, or if my preference for brews not afraid to be bold at every turn results in this below-average rating.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

2852,"2008-01-14",4.6,"I found this beer for sale at OBriens, with a hefty price tag for a 12 oz.  Still, it was cheaper than a ticket to Belgium and I wasnt about to pass up the top rated beer in the world.  Pours murky brown with a big tan head that stays around for a while.  Pleasantly sweet aroma of cherries, prunes, brown sugar, licorice, bread dough, oak, and  yeast.  Unbeleivably light mouthfeel.  Its like the beer hovers on your tongue.  Amazing taste.  It mimics the aroma quite well, with an intriguing combination of tastes.  I had the same problem as others: it was very, very difficult to pin down specific flavors.  It was almost as if the beer was blending and mixing while in your mouth.  Sweet, sour, spice, and fruit were in constant motion and made up a beer that is almost undescribably good.  It was well worth its price.","San Diego, California, USA","trokini"

Poured a dark murky brown into my St. Bernardus glass.  On first sip the beer is way to cold.  Still I pick up big dark fruit flavors, lots of prune juice soaked bread, with a finish that is lasting and perfect.  Upon warming it really opens up.  The flavors up front get bigger without losing the perfect balance and the finish lasts longer.  The balance is near perfect, with a complexity I have rarely seen in such a smooth and soft beer.

Re-rate:  Had another bottle of this last night.  I thought I might be able to rate this better without so much initial hype as the first time.  Still an awesome beer, lot to be said for the subtleties.  Also, one of the best beers I have had at room temperature.  Still, not quite as impressed on this second go.

2852,"2008-01-08",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 16, 2010 RERATE- bottle at In De Vrede. Has a hot, praline-nutty, cherry liqueur chocolate character, with less body, less complexity and more alcohol than I remember. Dumbed-down a notch?. Not my favourite beer in the world anymore- 848417. 


Fresh bottle bought at St. Sixtus, 29/12/07. Tasted of nothing but vague roasty/hoppy bitterness at In De Vrede owing to the flu, but back home its easy to see why this is currently revered as planet Earths no.#1 rated. Pours stouty mahogany with reddish edges against the light, and an irregular beige head. Aroma sharp, bready, yeasty and smothered with prunes, hazelnut, chocolate, dark spicy fruit and a touch of liquorice. Again, a slightly sulphurous note leaning towards living English bitter (Badger, Marstons, Wadworths?). Smells alive, beery and like its just been drawn from a cask. Impossible to sniff without salivating. Flavour easily the sweetest of the Holy Trinity, thick with toffee, milk chocolate and burnt sugar, but also intense charred malt (or at least the impression of it), 70% cocoa bitterness and a closing sting of bitter, bitter hops. Theres also sweet nutty malt like the 8, prunes and even suggestions of glace cherry or strawberry. The deliciousness of this beer lies in an intense bittersweetness thats uncomplicated, but difficult to pin down. Light but persuasive on the palate, with gentle coaxing alcohol and above everything, a nutty chocolate malt smoothness I dont want to end. Im not saying its the Greatest Beer in the World (Ive sampled to date), but its in the top one. 949419.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"

Pours very dark burgundy with a small head and great lacing.  Flavor is dark fruits quickly followed by spicy yeast.  Damn thats so flavorful and so smooth.  A nice malty finish that lingers forever.  Sip and sit as to not waste any of it.  Palate is sticky, yet very smooth especially for 10.2%.

2852,"2008-01-01",4.2,"(First off I must thank IMTheOptimator for this most generous gift.  I waited a long time to finally enjoy this bottle)  Big bready malty flavor.  Has that same fruit/candy quality that I found in the 8, but not in nearly the same intensity.  Has this been lost somewhat with age?  Cherry and dark fruits like plum and dates are all over the place.  Cinnamon is prevalent as well.  Alcohol warming is there, but the taste of alcohol is prefectly masked.  I like the westy yeast, especially compared to other belgian style strong ale yeasts.  It gives a nice floral estery profile.  The mixture of sweetness and dry maltiness is strange.  I keep thinking of rye bread.  The palate has no flaws.  Nice carbonation level aiding a dense, but somehow also light mouthfeel.  The real strength of this beer, though, is the complexity.  It doesnt pop like the 8 does, but does manage to combine bread, fruit, spice and even cocoa, blending them all together into a beautiful boquet.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"

Very effervescent, with rich wine-like nose with hints of molasses, bakers chocolate, and sweet fruity liqueur. On the palate, smooth but a little thin, tasting like a nice aged port with added barrel character, along with a sort of grape jelly note i remember from the 8, for which this is most definitely the more adult version.  A lovely long finish, melding through many different stages from winter spices to delicate candi sugar sweetness to a final delicate tingle of herbal hop bitterness.  Best beer in the world?

Quite complex on the  tongue. Dry, but lighter bodied red wine (Pinot?).  Dough.  Yeast.  Dried figs and plums.  Young port.  Some cinnamon spice. Wow. Im stuck as to  how vinous this is.

Simply tremendous flavor. So rich and complex..alcohol is subdued to a point that you can hardly notice it. So many others have described its multitude of characteristics in near perfection, so Ill spare you the details. Truly exceptional mouthfeel..silky smooth and delicious. As drinkable as any beer. This really leaves you wanting more..its a good thing this stuff isnt widely available, because Id be happy but poor.

2852,"2007-12-09",5.0,"Ive had quite a few different beers already but Ive waited for the King of Beers to make my first rating on the site. 
I can just say... stunning beer... a present of mother nature, heaven in you mouth. Its incredible how you can play with elements of nature to make such a delicious liquid.
One thing that suprises me is that its not that different from the St-Bernardus Abt 12, which has been my favourite beer until now. I cant say which of the two is the best... they are both just perfect brews, both better then the Rochefort 10 in my opinion. Ill have this as much as I can!","Belgium, BELGIUM","nondeduvel"
2852,"2007-12-04",4.7,"Today is my birthday, and my present to myself is to open a bottle of Westvleteren 12. Its pretty green though, about 4 months old at this point based on a best buy date of 10/11/09 (converted to american format). I poured a bottle into a chimay glass. 

It pours a very dark brown. It isnt black, but light barely penetrates. There is a nice mocha colored head that hangs around for a while and laces nicely down the glass leaving patches of foam on the surface of the beer. 

The aroma is great. It has a raisin and rich toffee aroma with a malty background. It is very sweet and there is another aroma on top of the raisins I cant quite place that might be caramelized brown sugar.

I have heard so much about this beer that I almost though it would fall short of my expectations. Fortunately, that was not the case. This is a great beer. The first thing that hits me is the insane level of smoothness and creaminess. For a Belgian Quad, it is ridiculous. In no way can I detect any of the 10.2% alcohol in this beer. I dont consider myself a good enough beer taster to break down all the flavors in this, but I get a pretty strong chocolate flavor and a bit of spiciness as well.

The feeling of this beer is great. It has great body, but not as heavy as a stout would be. I would consider it to be medium bodied but the complexity adds so much to the mouthfeel.

In case you couldnt figure it out from the rest of the review, the drinkability is extremely high. Im gonna have to start calling in all my favors from friends with belgian contacts.","Troy, New York, USA","drseamus"
2852,"2007-12-04",4.5,"At Gollem, Amsterdam, 12-2-07.   Dark brown, beige head, lace.   Looks perfect in its own chalice, very elegant.   My first impression of the aroma is lots of yeast; very bready and doughy.   Then prunes, dates, and pure malt; not overly sweet, and very intricate.   the flavor is bready as well; plenty of spice and dried fruit, but not sugary., and surprisingly not as sweet as the other abts Ive had.   No alcohol flavor.   The palate is very smooth and full, almost perfect.   Goes down cleanly with a finish that leaves a pleasant but not overly sweet taste in your mouth for quite a while.   I knew that they would have this when I was planning my trip to Amsterdam, but I was almost in disbelief until I actually ordered it and forked over the twelve euros.   It was served out of the cellar, like the St. Bernardus 12 that I had the nigh before, and that temperature perfectly complimented its flavors.   As the last of the top three abts to have rated, in comparison I would say that westy is by far the most drinkable and balanced.   I think that Rochefort has more complexities in the aroma, which I really like, but it can be  too rich and alcoholic.   St Bernardus  is about the same in intensity as westy, but lacks the powerful yeastiness and complexity of flavor.   Price wise, is it three times better than St Bernardus?   No way, and I know Ill be lucky to get another one any time soon, which I guess is part of the mystique.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Lots of yeast in the bottle (more than one centimetre). Made a tight but not too big creamy head. Aroma of brown sugar, port, chocolate (this one was more vinous with liquorice).

The aroma is really quite refined, with caramel apples mostly, some faint roastiness, noticeable sugar, and some slight clovey yeast notes. The flavor is incredibly harmonious. It begins with an edgy, roasty acidity with a few burnt notes. But it quickly softens and becomes more like caramel. I even detect a slightly oaty taste in there. I gets a little more tart again toward the finish, but also takes on a sort of bitter chocolate tone, with plenty of clove and maybe allspice. The aftertaste is warm but not distinctly alcoholic.

The overall taste is fruity, perhaps raisins or prunes with a sweeter strawberry. But the fruity taste is also combined with hops and some spices. Awesome. No need to say anything but top notch.

The quality is very noticeable for sure. I need to try this a few more times to generate a true opinion. Very nice.

It came to us in a glass and the appearance was mind blowing. It was fairly dark and super murky and the head was light tan and creamy and THICK, but thin maybe 1 inch. Frothy would not be a word I would use to describe it.  It was perfect through nearly every phase. The aroma was clean and clear and I easily detected hints of dried fruits perhaps prunes or raisins and roasted malts. I would have expected the flavor to be more sweet compared to that of the aroma, however the first sip was incredibly smooth and sophisticated with not even a note of extra sweetness. It was perfect I tell you! After 2 of them I must admit I was feeling happy. Has a wonderful mouthfeel perhaps the best, however I can not give it a perfect rating because another Trappist brew I tried, ""Orval"" wins(according to me) in flavor.

Pours a dark, murky brown body that lets just the slightest bit of light shine through.  A large, frothy, cream colored head settles to a thin but dense blanket of foam.  Random patches of microfilm lace are strewn about the glass.  The nose is intensely aromatic, and almost indescribably inviting.  Sweet caramel meets rum soaked figs, prunes, and raisons.  Scents of root beer, maple, cocoa, heavy cream, and Tahitian vanilla beans foreshadow the decadent flavors that are surely to follow.  The flavor is just downright epic.  Its sweet up front, with caramel and maple showing strong.  It then transitions seamlessly to the complimentary flavors of figs, raisons, and vanilla.  Surprisingly bitter floral hops tickle the roof of the mouth on the back end, providing punch and balance.  The body is medium-full, with a smooth, creamy mouthfeel that ends up just a bit too sticky.  Sweet and sour dry fruits linger on the palate for ages.

The sampled beer had been stored for a couple of years and it really was worth it: carbonation at its right level and a deeper tone in the flavor. No alcohol taste only a warm feeling!

Many similarities between the 3.  Westy is a little darker than the Berny.  Berny has a little more banana aroma.  Westy aroma gets nicer as it warms up, revealing more malty aromas. Westy a bit more cloudy.  Dark brown color.  A little more carbonation in the Berny.  Berny had a best by date of May, 3rd, 2012.  Westy had no date.  I cant help but think the Westy is young.  It almost reminds me of a slightly aged St. Bernardus.  This is the second time Ive had Westy 12.  The first was with Jon (WeeHeavySD) at OBriens Trappist Ale tasting.  I remember the Westy being spectacular, and probably much older...something like 4-6 years old.  This time it was just good, much less than my expectations.  Must rerate again someday.

Like so many others on the site, this was the one beer I had been most expectant to try.  Pour is deep brown, some ruby highlights, though pretty much no light escapes through.  Head is a rocky tan - off white 1 1/2 inch head.  Very nice to look at in a chalice.  Aroma is pretty big, consisting primarily of roasted malt, dried fruit (primarily raisins), and tobacco.  Initial taste of raisins, prunes, earthiness that all come at you in layer upon layer of taste.  Finish features some yeastiness.  Flavor is very long, intense, yet somehow blended and subdued at the same time.  I certainly understand the contradiction in the remark, but the flavor really did come big (initially), yet blended and subdued at the same time (as the beer opened up).  Hard to explain.  Very much coats the mouth.  Similar to the Westy Blond, this one needs to be tasted to be understood.  Certainly a world class beer and a world class beer tasting experience.

What can I say that hasnt been said? Lovely...and now I can dream about trying a bottle with some age on it. From everything I can taste in this beer now, that would be divine. 

Oct 08. Roughly year-old bottle. Yep. It rocks. 4.3 at least. Mmmmm...mmm.

Nov 09. Older bottle, best by 23.04.11 on the cap. Splendid, splendid beer. Mulled cider with raisins initially, later a surprising intensity of cherry juice.  This is a 4.5, not a 4.3. Ill bump to 4.4. 
Oct 13. 2005 bottle. Pours deep cloudy brown into my St. Bernardus chalice. Short-lived off-white head. Nose is spicy; flavor is perfection. So smooth at this age with microcarbonation, beautiful sweetness, zero sign of the alcohol. This one ages like a beauty. Compared to the St. Bernardus SE I had a few days ago, this is sweeter and smoother, overall more enjoyable. Rochefort 10 (a few weeks later) is absolutely no contest. Definitely a 4.5. Probably a 4.6. 

Nov 14. 2009 bottle (no collar on the glass). Softer and more subtle than I remember, but not kicking you in the teeth with the first sip can be a very good thing. As I make my way through the bottle the caramels and raisin and yeasts offer everything one could want in a dessert beer. 
Nov 15 Head to head with a 9-year-old St. Bernardus 12 SE. Spicier, very tasty, probably better one sip at a time. But it loses overall; the Bernardus SE is smoother, creamier, and more rewarding at the scale of a full glass. Splendid stuff.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"

Its got a little spice and brown sugar, and malt.  Amazing.  Just amazing.","Beech Grove, Indiana, USA","ebarnes"
2852,"2007-09-19",4.8,"Rating #500.  Bottle.  Pours a dark brown, about the color of darkly stained walnut.  Head is about two fingers of frothy tan.  Lacing begins right after pour.  Aromas are of raisins, soil, wet leather, chestnuts and dates.  Flavor is incredible, but it takes a second to blossom after each sip.  At first, my thought was, this is it, but it kept developing in different directions.  Starts off with a brown sugar and malt presence, and it finishes on a very similar note.  Between these bookends, however, it heads down fruit paths that remind me of dates, plums and raisins, before going back to a brown sugar finish.  The liquid is fairly thin... I noticed it when I was pouring... but the mouthfeel is anything but.  Big body and big flavor with a nice alcoholic warmth and just a touch of a bite.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

Previous Rating: 9/15/2007 Bottle, from Aarhus. Deep brown, just a bit of glow around the edges. Rough bubbles settle into fine sticky tan. Leathery tobacco, raisin-heavy Christmas pudding, mineral wind off the ocean. Flavor is raisiny port, molasses, rum, licorice, ink. Carbonation level is toward the full side, but not aggressive. Lingering treacle note. Lives up to the hype, but doesnt necessarily push past it. 8/5/7/5 17","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"
2852,"2007-09-12",4.8,"Celebrating a big day with a big beer.  Top 1% with a 100%.  It poured a dark and cloudy chestnut brown with a light tan head.  Complex carbonation giving obvious life to the goblet.  Spicy, nutty, rich malt, plum, orange, cherry aroma.  Robust flavor of dark plum and berry.  Sugar and something slightly anise as well.  Coffee and chocolate flavors presented themselves later in the tasting.  This beer will move on you...a complex dance of flavors with every sip.  The six pack was a Fathers Day gift and Im anxious for another reason to open a bottle.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","Harsebrau"
2852,"2007-09-12",4.1,"Pour was a super dark brown with some dark red and copper highlights.  The head was borderline tan with slight retention and little if any lacing.  This beer showed incredible depth and complexity in terms of aroma.  The first rush is malt, chocolate and licorice.  As it opened up aromas of fig, cherry, yeast and spice came into play.  Later into the beer I got brown sugar and grape soda.  The flavor was equally complex, seemingly having shifted gears each time I took a drink.  The initial flavor is a fairly straightforward blend of chocolate, malt and dried dark fruits.  As it progresses more tart fruits come into play like cherry and raspberry.  Yeast is noted as well.  Then I got a very distinct flavor of grape soda.  Not grapes, but purple, fizzy grape soda.  The mouthfeel was very nice and the alcohol was completely hidden.  A whirling dervish of a beer.  One whos ever changing aroma and flavors give it an extra point or two in my rating, even if I didnt think it was one of my favorite beers ever.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","Soonah"
2852,"2007-09-12",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2007 Bottle. Nose is deep. Lots of sweet malt character, very similar aroma to the Bernardus 12. Fig up front, spice; a touch of sourness; and some hop aroma. Other fruits, possibly pear, and a faint hint of chocolate. Very dark brown, near black. Swirly head with small tight bubbles around the edge. The flavor and palate are astounding. The beer is heavy and thick, bordering on syrupy, but so utterly smooth. The finish is crisp and slightly spicey, taking the edge off such a sweet beer. The alcohol is strong, but balanced, reminiscent of a good bourbon. Strong dark fruit flavors with oak and chocolate. I understand why this beer is so highly regarded, but there is possibly too much alcohol presence.","Austin, Texas, USA","slimchill"

The flavor is out of this world - a phenomenally rich malt body and flavor.  Incredibly smooth finish.  The finish is akin to that of fine aged scotch - where there is no alcohol burn, just a smooth experience from the time it hits your lips until you finish your last sip.

2852,"2007-08-28",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 14, 2007 Very excited to try this one out.  Perhaps I was a bit too excited as I may have poured too hurriedly into my chimay goblet and this resulted in a dissapointing, smaller head than expected. However, (very) fortunately I have a few more of these to pour with a good deal of prudence. Despite this minor pouring setback the brew had a beautiful chestnut brown color, and still a fair head with nice lacing.  The aromas sweeping off of the glass were fantastic and complex.  Mocha, nutty currant, figs yeast, wheat, cherry, berry aromas emerged and evolved throughout the session.  The body of this brew is simply perfect, with a velvety smooth texture and light warming sensation down the throat.  The flavors evolved tremendously while drinking and each sip seemed different than the previous.  Coffee/toffee charateristics emerged first quickly devloping soft and subtle spice flavors, yeilding hints of clove.  The fruit flavors were always present but evolved from berry, plum to earthy to some surprisingly acidic sour apple tastes, and again back to chocolate covered raspberries and a distant woody smokiness.  Over the hour and a half or so I spent enjoying this the flavors and aromas took me to such different levels that I had to respect this beers fine character.  While its reputation had filled me with certain expectations,  this beer certainly deserves its reputation and delivered  becuase of its layered complexity and incredible structure.","Miami, Florida, USA","cbeers21"

A 330ml bottle was bought at Plan B in Copenhagen in early August 07 and enjoyed at home in Tromsø some weeks later. Thanks to the guy at Plan B who in fact made some efforts to trace down a bottle on my request - great service. The elegant cap of the bottle is dated 01.11.2008. Served at cellar temperature.The first pour gives a brilliant clear mahogany coloured body topped by a creamy, beige head leaving fragile lacing on the glass. The second pour, with the sediments, reveals an opague chestnut body. Aromatic nuances of dark bread, malts and raisin - however, the smell gives an impression of being a bit closed. Delicious in taste with delightful and robust malty depths followed by flourish prunes, then both dates and plums come to support added by dark candy sugar. The best part is maybe the lingering, lovely finish of bitter dark malts, herbs and spices. Developing and changing mouthfeel. Perfect balance of bitterness and sweetness. Full bodied, but not cloying, and therefore very, very moreish. I will be hunting high and low for another bottle of this great stuff (25.08.2007).","Tromsø, NORWAY","Rune"

2852,"2007-08-10",4.5,"Wonderful treat brought back from Europe by a friend.  Aroma was subtly spicy with a sense of malty sweetness and hints of candy sugar.  Light character of dried cherries perceived upon initial pour, faded into spicier notes when the beer warmed.  Appearence was a hazy dark brown with some burgandy highlights.  Very little carbonation and very thin head (may have been too cold on initial pour) but what head there was had a medium tan color.  Flavor profile was dynamic.  When cool, the flavors were dominated by rich maltiness, some plum/ raisin hints of characteristic belgian yeast.  As it warmed, the sugars became balanced by the phenolics from the yeast and the maltiness diminished.  Mouthfeel was rich and full, despite low carbonation.  Significant levels of residual sugars combined with what seemed like a wheat character to create a silkiness that was quite enjoyable.  Overall, a great beer, one Im happy I enjoyed!

This was my first, and more than likely last, experience with Westy 12.

I can already sense an assertive aroma just from popping open the cap. A pour into the snifter reveals a dark cloudy burgundy with a tall head. The head is firm and defined with cascades beneath it as I swirl. Lacing is clingy and dense. The aroma is excellent with assertive floral sweetness and spiced notes. I pick up cardamom, earth, baking chocolate, cloves, honey, molasses, pineapple; I just cant dissect it thoroughly enough, yet perfect balance is maintained. This is actually lighter on the palate than I was expecting, though its still very full bodied and creamy. Id say Rocheforts offering is a little more dense. The alcohol comes through, but its not bad. The finish is drying with dark fruits throughout. A thin sweetness akin to honey balances things out. Each sip is a journey starting with the more acidic notes of plums and spices, fading into a semi-sweet territory like molasses, cherries, white wine, licorice, and lingering on a tangy, zesty flavor before my tongue is left with sensations of earth, honey, figs, and other fruits. This is easily one of my favorite Belgian brews with its sophisticated flavor profile, immaculate balance, and assertive palate.  I dont know if it lives up to 100% of its hype or the fact that its so hard to get (especially since a couple of other delicious quads are a bit more handy), but it is seriously a very damned good beer.

2852,"2007-07-25",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2010 Wow.  Thanks to Dan for the sharing of the bottle first and foremost.  
Did a blind tasting next to Bernardus 12.  
At first, I could not taste a difference, but after a few tastes the balance and the bright fruitness made this beer stand out so much that there was not even a question as to what beer was which (besides carbonation and color issues, which made it even easier to tell).
There was a very soft head to the beer.  A slight nuttiness in the aroma and an estery fruitness that was completely pleasant, if a little understated.  The taste was first of bright fruit, then of chocolate, and then, and then and then... this beer is deeply complex, but so simply complex that it is difficult to really get everything with a small sample, or even one beer.  
There was a slight, pleasant oxidation of the beer.  And the palate lingers in a honeysuckle sweet remembrance that is at once a jubilant thing  for the experience of having this beer yet is      depressing because I know that it will be a long time before I enjoy this beer again.
The hype, for me, is validated.  Is it the best beer in the world, probably not.  It is damn close though, if only because it reminds me of the first time that I had expedition stout; a time when my favorite beer was McEwans Scotch Ale (and I had not even found ratebeer yet), and my first taste of Traquair Jacobite Ale.  This beer makes me really appreciate and love beer.

2852,"2007-07-17",4.3,"A deep and opaque garnet shade.  Aroma of raspberries, port, and a pecan-pumpkin bread.  Chocolate shavings and a dry cabernet.  Tastes of a dark and ancient fruit reduction.  A deep Malbec wine leaning toward cinnamon.  Dark chocolate cookies thick with rum.  Lighter moments of bananas and clementines.  The citrus punch resonates in the mouth after swallowing, slowly giving way to a visceral pulse of warm breath, though the alcohol is hidden.  Finishes with an expansive echo of honey, strawberry and dark spice.  Palate is at once delicate as a flower and forceful as fire.  This one reaches right to the heart in a valiant effort to seize it.  Brilliant and undeniable.  Thanks Keith!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

2852,"2007-07-13",5.0,"A truly remarkable beer and the best I have ever tried.  The color is a rich reddish amber-brown with a thick, creamy, rocky, tight-nit, beige head.  Head duration is nearly fully lasting with Belgian lacing.  Malt is the dominate aroma with bread, toffee, and a hint of roast.  In the background are sublte hints of orange, pear, cherries, dates, a touch of smoke, and a bit yeasty.  The flavor is a symphony of tastes.  Sweet malt greets the palate but is tempered with the hop bitterness and a slight touch of fruit.  The finish leaves a hovering of maltiness on the palate that gently fades away.  I highly recommend that everyone try this at least once.  Without a doubt this is the best and worth the wait until I got to my 1000 rating.","USA","ehhdayton"

2852,"2007-07-09",4.9,"So, to be honest, I have sat at 99 beers rated for the last three weeks almost entirely in part because I havent known which beer I could, should, or would rate for my historic 100th beer.  As trivial as this may sound, it has played on my mind quite a bit.
First off I thought, pick the beer that you first drank and loved as a teenager.  Then I proceeded to, pick the most Canadian beer (me being Canadian and all).  Then I moved to the thinking, ""this is ridiculous, pick any beer you get your hands"".  Then, nothing.  As such, I have been sitting on the verge of the 100 beer club since early June (almost 1 month ago).  
Enter my backyard neighbour, a fun-loving American chap with a Belgian wife, whom I just got to know over the last few weeks when we have shared a couple of wheat beers, and a couple of whites.  Well, low and behold to my shocking surprise, Jim pipes up and tells me that he has 2 bottles of Westvleteren 12 sitting at his apartment waiting for a special occasion.  I told him, ""Jim, I am told the day you open a Westvleteren 12 is the special occasion.  Everything else is trivial"".  
Blah, blah, blah, the sappy story ends with Jim cracking open the beers and passing me the glass.  
The rest is history, just as people describe.  This is truly the most unbelievable beer I have ever tasted, and makes me want to re-rate the last 99 beers and knock them down a point or two.  
How in the names of all things holy did these monks pack 10.2% alcohol into this beer?  If you are lucky enough to drink it, then you will know what I am talking about.
Jim, my neighbour and friend, bottoms up.  You the man.  
Cheers.","Whitmore Lake, Michigan, USA","Dezzilu"

Appearance is a reddish ruby-brown, with a tan head.  Aroma is sweet and slightly fruity, with many flavors vying for attention.  The beer is incredibly complex, but subtly so, with the flavors almost dancing across your tongue.  You get spicy, woody, earthy, and fruity notes, all in such a short period of time.

2852,"2007-06-15",4.6,"My heartfelt thanks to Arun for treating me with this pricey beer. 10 euros for a 30 cl bottle is too steep for stingy me. The taste is almost worth it. We compared the 2006 11% Gouden Carollus Cuvee van de Kaiser and the Rochefort Trappistes 10. This was a night to remember indeed. My preference is still the Cuvee van de Kaiser. Nevertheless, the monks at the Abbey do produce an incredibly superb beer. It is a real pity that it is so expensive and difficult to find. The high level of alcohol is unnoticeable. It is a very subtle and smooth beer with several flavors tightly knit together. Sweet but only mildly bitter. The foretaste is a disappointment. (Hmmm, it isnt that good.) Then the full flavor kicks in. It is delightful. This is surprisingly smooth, not at all what I expected. Each sip is to be savored for several seconds. The aftertaste is likewise very subtle as different flavors melt away. It does not coat the mouth and throat in the way that the Cuvee does. The range or spectrum of flavor is not as wide. Yet it does not disappoint at all -except maybe the wallet.","Den Haag, NETHERLANDS","rjglory"
2852,"2007-06-11",4.9,"UPDATED: MAY 4, 2008 Rerate: 1996 bottle, courtesy Papsoe, shared with folks at Oldsmar Tap House. Pours a cloudy murky caramel color. Lots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is full of delicious aroma and some butterscotch and gorgeous, nostril-filling fruity esters. Divine. Flavor is chock full of gorgeous, mouth-savoring notes, including caramel, dark candy, plum, rich fruits, brown sugar...amazing. Extremely drinkable and as good as a beer as Ive ever had. We had it side by side with an 07 Westy 12, and this one destroyed the latter. Amazing.

Huge thanks to my dear friend peabody for this one. Looks beautiful. The smell doesnt hit me as well as the Westy 8. The taste is amazing and so smooth for a 10% beer. Best in the world? Tough call. I think I like the Westy 8 more. Still, a fantastic brew here.","Tampa, Florida, USA","gunhaver"

2852,"2007-05-30",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 17, 2008 Indeed, the best Belgian brew I have ever tried. Worthy of the #1 beer in the world status. Opened my bottle with jarpag after sampling his 05 bottle in celebration of college graduation. My bottle is from mid-late 05.  Poured a deep mohogany color with a small beige head that cascaded around its edges and good lacing throughout a whole Trappist glass. Then came the aroma....wow! Blew me away with thick notes of Belgian yeast, malt, banana, raisin, dark fruits and raspberry! Flavor was similar to the aroma, but soooo incredibly complex. Each sip was a new experience, and the palate was unique all its own. Plum, raisin, candy sugar, more banana and pear. Perfect -a mouthfeel that is nearly un-describable, so velvety smooth and numbing in the mouth, it keeps the wonderful flavor on the back of the tongue forever.

The Westy was sooooo wonderful in the mouth.  So rich, smooth, velvety, complex and soft.  I wanted to take a bite out of the side of my cheek and lips after swallowing.  The carbonation was so elegant and perfect - hard to describe its superiority - it needs a 6 out of 5 for palate.

Palate was medium to full bodied, softly carbonated, creamy and slightly alcoholic.

The nose is just unbelievable.  Plum, butterscotch, caramel, butter, every dark sweet scent perfectly ripened, very pleasurable.  Appearance is really dense, but not too much sediment. Not like the Brune from Abbayes des Rocs we drank right beforehand.  Westy is finely filtered, but still dense.  
Flavor slight burn when it was cold, but the cold sharpness really faded into pure smooth silky goodness about 10 minutes into it.  It has an amazing fully loaded body, so many textures and contours.  The flavor was the most complex Ive had.  Cherry, maple, nutmeg, chocolate, but not too sweet like a grand cru, and again, amazingly clear flavors with such a high alcohol %.  
Bottom line, this is the most skilled brew Ive had to date, Im being as objective as I can as so many people feel the same way I do.  Knowing the monks dont mass produce it despite the demand only increases its succulence.  Its made with care, dedication, appreciation, and profound skill.

Wholesome and rich, with a sweet chocolate/cotton candy aroma.  You can taste the ripe fruit and alcohol, and you notice the setery taste on the top of the mouth.  If I can do this justice, I would say that it tasted similar to a chocolate covered cordial cherry (real one, not those boxed types).

2852,"2007-04-26",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2007  Rating #1000   I did a side by side between an approx. 5 year old bottle (labeled at 10.6%) and a 6 month old bottle (labeled at 10.2%).  I will give the beginning stats on the five year old and then the traits / differences of the 6 month old.   The  five year old  bottle had a minor ""pfft"" when the cap came off.  Poured with the color of brown sugar with a nice beige head that was very respectable for the age.  The aroma is full and open with plums, raspberries, brown sugar, thick caramel, earthy malt, red wine notes, buttered toffee, raisins and more - there is something new with each wiff.  Full body thats thick and velvety smooth with some incredibly soft carbonation.  The flavor starts with brown sugar, Belgium earthiness, plums, raisins & smooth rich toffee-like earthiness.  The finish adds some spice and a surprising sharpness and some astringency.  As it warms the raspberry aspect comes out more and the finish loses some of the sharpness and becomes more lush and adds dark cherry, brown sugar and caramel. (9/4/9/4/18/4.4)    The  six month  version pour deep mahogany  with a dense tan head - everything darker than the older version.  The aroma has cola, brown sugar and other flavors of the aged version, but all of the favors are more subdued and sharper.  There is less earthiness, but more fruit.  More brown sugar and caramel earthiness as it warms, but nothing like the aged bottle.  The flavors are much tighter and hidden, the five yar was significantly more lush and opened up.  Medium / full body with fairly sharp carbonation.  The taste is more sharp with earthiness, very dark caramel, coriander and pepper.  The finish gets quite sharp with anise and  pepper.  As it warms it opens up more, but nowhere near where the aged version was from the beginning. (8/5/8/4/17/4.2)   Overall, it is well worth aging the beer.  Ive held onto the aged beer for years and it was worth it.  Big thumbs up  for this exceptional beer, but if you have the patience with a fresh bottle it is advised to give this a bit of time to age.  The rating numbers are for the older version as it was quite a bit better.  I forgot to add on the original rating a big thanks to  mkofron  and  mad_scotsman  for the hook-up on the fresh bottle.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
2852,"2007-04-26",4.7,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2008 Bottle at t Waagstuk, Antwerp. Pours a deep, deep brown bordering on black with a dense and foamy one-finger off-white, bordering on tan head.  Nose is complex and distinctive.  Dusty and earthy notes are heavy, as well as dark pit fruits that round into a nice fruity sweetness.  Also significant yeast presence here, in the form of some interesting esters.  Well balanced between an overarching sweetness and a subdued, massively complex and inviting stable of other elements.  Taste does not disappoint:  the epitome of the sweet/savory interplay that I find in a lot of really well crafted brews.  Dark pit fruits in prunes and plums, caramel, hints of milk chocolate. Slight, complexity-adding yeast funk. Finish is short and sweet, after just a dash of mild alcohol.  The lack of alcohol presence in this beer is really to be marveled at.  Palate is so incredibly sexy:  stunningly smooth and velvety on the tongue, this is the ultimate in sipper beers.  Searched far and wide for this and it definitely did not disappoint. Easily the best Ive ever had - 4.7 may as well be a 5 for me, considering how conservative I am in my ratings.

Update: had the opportunity to try a 25 year old (1983) vintage bottle of this at Ebenezers in Lovell, Maine. It held up - mouthfeel a little lighter, taste definitely sweeter and noticeably complex.  Estery, spicy notes faded and more caramel and chocolate came up front.  Aged quite well.  Rating still based on fresh bottle.","Ithaca, New York, USA","dmradus"

Aroma is sweet, but not cloying, with very present raisins, oak, and belgian yeast. Flavor is much more impressive than the Westy 8, with caramel, brown sugar, dark fruit, and a light alcohol presence all forming a quite wonderful brew. The creamy mouthfeel is probably the highlight of this very complex belgian quad, really explaining why it is so highly rated.

Not quite as complex as I expected.  Flavor is similar to aroma with very sweet dark fruits highlighting the campaign. I can honestly say that I have not had a beer quite like this before, however it is not my favorite beer in the world either. Didnt taste any chocolate, surprisingly.

When I finally did take a sip, my mouth was assaulted with a huge array of flavors: fruits, candy, chocolate, nuts. Sticky, creamy, warming mouthfeel. Flavors are so intense and complex, cannot wait to try this one again, if I should ever have the opportunity. Swirling around in the glass, the beer leaves a thick coating on every inch it touches. Warming finish with a nice hint of the alcohol that is present. One of the few things in life that lives up to the immense hype that has been placed upon it.

The smell is a fantastic malt aroma, along with different kinds of sweet fruit.  The flavor hits as soon as it enters the mouth.  The velvety caramel complex flavor with little to medium carbonation is something to savor.  All these flavors throughout tasting are just incredible.  Complex flavor that stays balanced all the way through, but keeps changing as the beer warms.  Its amazing how this beer keeps its complexity and taste throughout the duration of tasting.

Its almost black, and the head is moderate. The aroma is wonderfully complex, it has notes of malt, figs, fruit, oak and hops. The flavour is sweetish and very complex, and in my mouth the dominant notes are malt, figs and other dark fruits, caramel, nuts, basement, earth and hops. The hops are very aromatic and gives a very nice bitterness, that is very unlike to other Belgian beers I have tasted. Its an incredible beer!","Thisted, DENMARK","Maria"
2852,"2007-02-01",4.7,"330ml bottle. Dark red, brown body with a nice creamy head. Both aroma an flavor is complex. Sweet malty, slightly roasted warming alcoholic, dry fruit, spicy and a nice amount of hops. Its a world-class beer and difficult to come up with something new to say. I believe true beer lovers have Westvleteren very high up on their top list. I have had the pleasure of sampling this beer and the 12 a few times during the years. Sometimes I have rated the 8 above the 12 and vice versa. Finally I had the chance to compare them at the same time, and I must admit that the 12 are just a bit better. Its easy to notice the family likeness of these and natural to compare them. The 12 is the big brother, has a little bit extra of everything, and still so delicate balanced. Nothing is dominating in any direction. This beer is close to perfect and still have the quality of offering the drinker a different experience depending on the situation.","Kristiansand, NORWAY","Beer5000"
2852,"2007-01-31",4.6,"(Bottle, Man in the Moon, Stockholm) Dark brown colour with ruby notes, foamy off-white head leaving very little lacing. Fruity and spicy nose with dried fruit (raisins, figs), spices (cinnamon?), marzipan and hints of fresh berries (raspberries, strawberries) coming through after a while. Malty, fruity taste, slightly roasted with dried fruit (figs, raisins), spices and bittersweet notes of cold coffee and liquorice coming through in the long and spicy finish. Alcohol giving it some sweetness, but still very well balanced, and a chewy, fiery mouthfeel. What can be said about this beer has probably already been said, so I can just certify that this is quite a lovely brew, or rather a masterpiece.

The color was a reddish brown with some sediment evident even though I tried to leave most of the year in the bottle. The nose offers a sweet character that reminds me of caramel and butterscotch.

What a beer, the best I´ve ever had.

A redbrown beer with a huge and long lasting palebrown head.

Aromas dominated by dried fruits especially prunes and plums. Very nice, but mayby there could be a little more to the aroma (when speaking of the perfect beer)

Taste Is fantastic, thick flowing and fills the mouth with sweetness agian taste of prunes and plums. Very long and warming finish. You don´t feel the alcohol at all.

2852,"2007-01-21",4.7,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2009 Rating #600 - It took me awhile to get a hold of this one, but Ive had it twice now so I can try to do the rating justice.  It pours dark reddish-brown with a medium, enduring head that laces nicely.  The aroma is yeast, spices, and rather tart dark fruits.  The flavor has yeast and malts accented by slightly sour dark fruit flavors and some pleasant spiciness (coriander?).  Full bodied and lively on the palate, this brew finishes dry and mildly hoppy with some alcohol noticeable.  This is a really great beer.  I have to say though that I think I like the Rochefort 10 a little bit more.  
(Lastest bottle, 9/21/07, I couldnt stop smelling this beer, so Im bumping the aroma to 10.  Its really amazingly fruity with berries joining the malt and yeast.)

Additional notes from 12/7/09 alongside a Rochefort 10 - Dark fruits in the aroma include cherries and figs, especially the cherries.  The myriad flavors including the aforementioned dark fruits, the malt, the spice, and more in this beer are just perfectly balanced.  What an enjoyable drinking experience.  Bumping overall to 19.  In the side by side I give it the edge over the Rochefort 10.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"

2852,"2007-01-17",5.0,"My 100th rating!!!!!!!  Ah, what a sweet treat this one turned out to be.  Ive studied trappist beers for the better part of two years now and this was the crown jewel of all my efforts at researching this epic brew.  Ive sampled this on two separate occasions just to reinforce my thoughts.  Plus, with all the hype I attempted to be as objective as possible.  However, this is one of those rare experiences where it certainly lived up to my expectations.  Simply put, this is a beer of legendary proportions.  

Pours typical of most trappist quads with a nice fluffy head and good lacing.  The essence of dark plums, raisons and dates drift into my nose.  Further exploration detects the esters of a masterpiece of fermentation along with the dark candi syrup which this is a hallmark of.  Taking the first sip brings wave after wave of deep layers of complexity that forms a tapestry of flavours the likes of which I havent experienced before.  Deep levels of caramelization that waltz in and out of your senses along with the delicate essences of northern european hops that masterfully balance out the candied sugars that are intertwined.  The body is matched perfectly for this style as you are allowed to taste the delicate nuances the monks introduced and not bombarded with an over-the-top chewy mess as other inferior attempts have tried to do.  The finish itself is an experience that leaves you wanting to step away from the glass for awhile just to enjoy the afterglow of an almost orgiastic feast of the senses.  A whole additional layer of caramelization sets in with a warmth of light alcohol making its presence known.  Perfectly hidden only to escape at the proper moment to leave you wondering how such a brew came to be so well done.  Minutes pass as the finish lingers in your mouth and I wonder how long I can prolong this experience.  There, it slowly passes and I find myself newly enlightened by a masterpiece of the brewing world.","Grafton, Wisconsin, USA","Ofortuna"

2852,"2007-01-14",5.0,"Pours a deep brown color, with brick red hues when held to the light. Half an inch of smooth and creamy tan foam tops it off. Thick sheets of foamy lace. Belgian chocolate, fruit, yeast, and alcohol in the nose.

First sip - oh my this is nice. Soft and smooth flavors of sweet plum, bread, earthy fig, rum, and mild chocolate dance and dance and dance. There’s a delicate but sharp tannin-like bitterness at mid sip that could be hops, or it could be bitter chocolate, or it could just be the alcohol. After a couple sips, I settle on alcohol as the cause, as its presence is sensed as a pleasant vaporous warmth in my throat, my lungs, my tongue, my sinuses… I’d certainly fail a breathalizer right now, and these were my first couple sips of the day. Now I lick my lips expecting alcohol, and instead get a yeasty bready flavor with some smooth Mackinac Island fudge.

Silky smooth mouthfeel - creamy, velvety, soft, luscious. Moderate carbonation, full body. Prolonged alcohol in the aftertaste. Becomes even more fruity and even spicy the deeper I dive into the bottle. This is like candy, very addictive.","Euphoria, Minnesota, USA","detroiter"

I found it at a small beer shop in Brugge and brought it back to the hotel.  My first sip made me a believer.  Its hard to know where the hype ends and the truth begins, but with this beer, I think the brewers have truly come up with something special.  I understand that St Bernardus is basically the same beer, but Ive had that beer on several occasions, and while I find it delicious, it has not quite impressed me in the same way as the original.","Washington, USA","Svejk"

The flavor is very nice with a silky soft alcohol burn accompanied by a nice toffee/caramel presence.  There is also hints of chocolate, raisens and a very subtle, almost islay scotch peaty character.

2852,"2007-01-11",5.0,"UPDATED: DEC 5, 2007 My bottle stated 11.2 ABV. Pours dark tawny mahogany w/ a medium sized semi creamy tan froth. Froth is spattered w/ tiny bubbles and reduces slowly to a fine lace and a dusty canopy. Aromas of bright, dusty, dried dark fruits w/ slight tart cherry (jolly rancher). Medium nectar w/ ample residual effers creats a creamy, velvety texture. I think the palate texture of this brew is what sets it apart. Its amazing that an ale can feel like that. Flavors are bold w/ a mild to moderate sweetness that is quickly balanced by a peach pit bittering componant. My first sip was pure bakers cocoa. Dark, bitter and chocolatey. Very nice! There is a defined alcohol presence in the flavor profile that really kicks in on the finish. This is not offensive to me at all. Dried dark fruits like black cherry, plumb, w/ slight fig and raisons. Meaty tropshire like a well marbled Porter House steak and leather. Other nuances of chewing tobacco and dark cakebread, bakers cocoa, molasses, red grapes w/ the seeds, and caramel apple. The Cocoa lasts throughout the whole sip to the finish. This is a very warming brew. I can feel my blood temp rising in my face about my ears. The finish is bittered better than moderate with that huge alcohol goins ons.

2852,"2007-01-04",4.6,"UPDATED: APR 26, 2007 Courtesy boboski.  Bottle from 2002.  Poured thickly into a trappist glass with an amalgam of various dark ruby-brown colors topped with a slow moving thin off-white head.  Aroma is apricot, plum, and a variety of spice notes that change by the minute.  A wonderful malt base aroma compliments along with the yeast.  The mouthfeel is absolutely perfect - medium in body with enough carbonation to further enhance the sensory intake of aroma and taste.  The taste is spicy and warm, has clove and fruit tastes that develop as it warms and the finish has a slight tart suggestion that lingers along with the warmth.  The alcohol presence is detectable only a bit after you sip.  Once I had a Rochefort 10, I somehow doubted that a Westy 12 could be better, but it is.  As a rater, you dont really know what the limits of aroma, taste, etc. are unitl theyre surpassed, and this one did for me in a couple categories.

Huge toffeeish notes, a sweet roasty almond character, sweet pastry doughyness, some spicyness evident of cloves and peppery alcohol warmth. Caramel undertones and a warming dry finish. In short its perfectly balanced, creamy, buttery and delicious. However, its not my #1 in the world. I think that there is such a thing as supply and demand.

2852,"2006-12-23",4.8,"2002. Last bottle ever sold at Knightly Spirits, Orlando, Florida. Complexity Ive never experienced in any type of beverage. Pours what seems to me a perfect head with beautiful retention and pretty lacing, but the taste and aroma are the only things Im concerned with. Beautiful ruby with swirling ruddy brown highlights. Aroma of raisins, prunes, white chocolate, heavy cream, red berries. Taste always seems different and constantly evolving, but never uninteresting. So full bodied and luxurious, to die for. Flavor near-perfectly balances malts and hops. While present, the hops only serve as an agent to add to the complexity, never overpowering, always intriguing. 

1975. At thirty years old, Im mortified that the first thing I nose is a slight tinge of oxidation once Ive poured it into the glass.

Thanks to Cougar for driving this up from Atlanta as well.  I was planning on saving it for rating #500 but it is hard to resist something like this placed in front of you, especially a five year old vintage (2001-07).  I guess Ill just have to try the new top beer instead.  After having it I can see how it stayed at the top so long.  This is complex, rich and very busy.  If you are ever in Belgium you must pick this up - while it is hard to justify at $25 a bottle it is a steal at $5.
Aroma / Appearance - Caramel, chocolate, vanilla, strawberries and cream create a rich tapestry of scents which blend together to form a very inviting aroma.  The body is a rusty brown color with lacing that leaves a history of the level as you sip.
Flavor / Palate - Caramel and chocolate greet the tongue on the first sip.  After that comes fresh Swiss chocolate dipped strawberries.  It might be a little alcoholic but it is well masked by everything that is going on.  Honey comes to the fore of a perfumy and sweet aftertaste.

had to go through alot to get one, but it was worth it

The head settled into a creamy foam, showing the most amazing lace patterns I have seen on a beer, I just sat and swirled it around the glass for a while, watching the webs of beer wind their way down the glass, I  would have given the beer 6/5 for appearance if I could. The aroma, strong, complex... raisons, smoke, nuts, sweet warmth, alcoholic spiciness, you cannot even begin to describe what comes through. The body is sweet, warm, sticky and smooth, so smooth... Delivering a list of flavours too long to mention, the hops are amazing, not too bitter, not too flavoursome, a little green and spicy perhaps. The malt profile is stunning, layer upon layer of complexity... you think, for example ""oh, its chocolate, there is more chocolate than anything else!"" then you have another sip, and  something different grabs you.

This beer has it all. It is very malty, the sweetness is perfect and the bitterings of the hops are very complex. Aftertaste is very long, alcohol is well integrated and hop bitters super complex.

2852,"2006-12-02",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 3, 2006 The bottle came to me in a trade from BA dogfooddog, and was unlabeled, with a yellow cap indicating a best before date of 08 04 08, making this a little over a year old.  As I poured into a tulip, the beer came out murky dark brown and had a two finger thick foamy head.  The aroma was spicy-sweet, with the smells of fresh hay, ripe cherries, chocolate, brown sugar, and apple skins detectable.  The taste was about as smooth as I have had in a beer of this strength.  Sweet tropical fruit and spiced bread like malts interplayed with earthy yeast and spicy hops, and everything was in perfect balance.  The beer was somehow robust and delicate at the same time.  At this young age the alcohol was evident, but only as soothing warmth.  The mouthfeel was oily smooth, and the beer went down very easily and left a sweet aftertaste.  Very fine beer indeed.

I decided to drink it side by side with a 2006 St. Bernardus Abt 12 for the sake of comparison.  The color of the two was almost the same but the St. Bernardus was much more carbonated.  It also smelled stronger, and had a distinctly sour note in the taste that was absent from the Westvleteren offering.  The Westvleteren was sweeter and smoother than the secular cousin.  Bottom line; cant go wrong with either of them.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
2852,"2006-12-01",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 17, 2007 Almost every month i get 2 crates.
My experience is that there are huge differences between batches. I suggest that people mention the bottledate. For example 01/07 and 03/07 are way below standard quality. (less carbonation and thus rather dull)
This beer is ... well... awesome good. But people who have diffuculties to find this beer should know that this resembles  the ""St bernardus Abt"". Watou made this beer under license from the end of WW2 until 1992.  There is however a difference between a westy of 6 months and a fresh one. 
Just recently the monks have limited the visits to 1 car a month. (I know people who managed to go there 5 times (x3 crates) since  14 october 2006), those crates were then exported immediatly. So it will be even harder to find  this beer in the future.

It is literally, never ending - chocolates, wood, tobaccos, creamy caramel, sweet cherries, it goes on and one.  Very slight trace of alcohol.  Fantastic.  Great lacing and creamy mouthfeel taboot.  The cherry note seems to take the forefront in the body - followed by smooth plum and banana notes.  The fruitiness lingers long into the finish, which is a bit hot.

2852,"2006-11-21",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 17, 2009 August 2006 Bottling (Tasted March 2009, 4.1) Ageing gracefully. Showed lots of powerful toffee, rum and raisen, not at all expected for a bottle with some age. Dried out a touch as the beer warmed up to reveal harder bitter chocolate notes. Even finishes a touch salty Structure is very much in tact although I think the fruit has dropped out a touch due to aging. (score is as per original tasting.
August 2006 Bottling (tasted October 2006)Ok  the big daddy! Thin creamy head breaks up after 15 minutes. Quite garnet / brown in colour, a little lighter than expected. Sweet malts on the nose show some toffee. The obvious flavour concentration never goes over the top.  Big mouthfeel. Whereas the 6 and 8 may have felt a little constrained the beer definitely drops all the shackles. Sweet malts, toffee, cooked sugar, aniseed  plenty happening. Palate structure is less impressive (all things relative), as it delivers the all flavours in a more what you see is what you get style (ie perhaps a little forced). Doesnt really have the obviously layers that a JW Lees Harvest Ale, or, dare I say, Redoak Baltic Porter, delivers. Notwithstanding, this is a great beer. e5.0 @ Afspanning t Waagstuk.

The flavor is even better than the aroma.  Dried friuts are present with spicy notes from the hops and alcohol.  everything is perfectly in balance in this beer.

I think this is a beer that beer lovers are afraid to rate honestly because they feel their other beer aficianados my have a more sofisticated palate than they have. My honest opinion is that this is one of the top belgian beers that I have tasted. Strangely it is so smooth that I can understand that some (including myself) can not express one defining characteristic to describe this beer. It is in the same class as St. Bernardus abt 12 and Rochefort 10. I still prefer the Rochefort. My recommendation is if you can try it at what you feel is a resonable price you should. However, for those that cant afford it or choose not to try this rare beer.... you shouldnt feel like you are left out of the ""beer club"". If you can try a St. Bernardus or Rochefort you are truly tasting beers in the same class that are as good or better depending on your taste.

2852,"2006-10-18",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 1, 2010 Complete re-write for a very fresh bottle
In short: A decadent Abt.  One of the best (if not THE best) of its kind.  Lives up to the hype.
How: Bottle 330ml at In de Vrede (pub in front of the Westvleteren abbey).  About two months old, bottling date on the cap. 
The look: Purple-brown body topped by a medium beige head with medium retention
In long: Intense aroma with earthy dark fruits, tobacco, chocolate and more. That beer has lots of great qualities but its body is my favourite of them all.  Big, rich, smooth, creamy, filling.  Swimming in this 5/5 body are a ton of malts and juicy leafy hops.  Flavors of dark fruits, toffee, milk chocolate, nuts, tobacco, wood, name it!  I was very surprised at how hoppy a fresh bottle is.  Lot and logs of juicy leafy hops with a medium slightly resinous bitterness.  Alcohol remains well hidden until a little bite at the end.  Totally decadent.  The sad part about being labelled the #1 beer in the world is that you cannot surpass the expectations. It is not my own #1 beer but it will always be in my top 50 nonetheless. It is sad to see that this wonderful beer is circulating a lot but mostly is borderline illegal ways.

The lady came over, I asked nervously ""Do you have any Westvleteren"" without answering she brought a laminated small sheet with a selection of Westvleteren beer back, I gave the others a knowing look and picked the 12. She slowly walked towards me with bottle and glass in hand, I licked my lips, this must have been how Bobby Moore felt when the queen presented him with the Jules Rimet Trophy, and like Bobby Moore I wiped my hands, though on my trousers not shorts and more through sweat than mud. the glass and beer were laid before me and it was expertly poured. I lifted it up and hark was that the voices of angels belting out Jerusalem? I cradled the glass whilst the others watched intently, slowly I lifted it up, the group on the other table were huddled like a group of Hyenas staring silently waiting for scaps, I fixed them a steely glance and they cowered back.

I thoroughly enjoyed that beer then and whilst it was young I think the 1998 Westy I had was even better that day.  The bottles that Ive had since then have all been young, fresh and a bit raw, even dare I say it harsh, the alcohol showing more and without the mellowness of age its just not the same beer.

I constantly wonder why, or how drunk I was to be online and felt it justifiable to spend 25$ for a bottle of this all the way from Belgium but when I look at the scarcity of it, the 1# rating, and what a change it was from other beers Ive tasted, Im kicking myself for not ordering more. This beer is at the top of its class, and rightfully so. There is so much going on in this beer its hard to describe. Every sip is different. Chocolate, raisons, and roasted caramel stood out most when I tasted it. Brilliant long lasting head, and gorgeous overall appearance. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on it.

Ive had it in my celler for quite some time and today I drunk it.

And what can I say? First of all, its good. Very good. These monastery guys really know whats beer all about. Fruity, dark flavour, its got it all. I understand why beer lovers really love and love and love this beer over and over again.

However, for me, its too much of everything. I loved to drink it, I loved to smell it, I loved to feel it, but I didnt love to feel its incredible taste. Not that it is not excellent (cause it is) not that it is not perfect (cause it probably is) but the hype is bigger than the beer from my point of view. It is objective fantastic, but subjective only GREAT.

I had problems finish it, probably mainly due to my love for not that complexe beers. 

Still, what can I say? Its what beers all about, but still too much of a really good thing. 

As you probably understand, the beer puts me in a total duality of a fantastic experience and a feeing of drinkability and enjoyment. It was like ""Shit, this beer is gooooood"" with a grimmy face.

While I cant say this is my personal favorite beer in the world, I certainly can agree that this may be the best crafted beer in the world, and so have no remorse giving it a big rating.

2852,"2006-10-03",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2007 Bottle 53F Trappist. Light banana aroma, with a touch of black licorice, a touch of chocolate. A very cloudy dark, dark brown color, with a tan head that lasts.  Heavy fusil tastes, very big tons of raisin, maybe dates too, finishes with warm bread plenty of alcohol as well, with a bit of corn flakes at the end. Sweet taste almost no  bitterness.  The date on it was 26.04.09 maybe I should have let it set for a year or two. That would have made for better balance.  Really big bananas and good bready malts.  I think I drank this bottle too soon. I should have given it a few more months or years, it tastes a lot like my homebrew and that really disturbs me. Good palate light but tons of carbonation. A good brew just consumed too soon, damn I have no patience.","oklahoma city, Oklahoma, USA","jetzler"
2852,"2006-10-02",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2006 Number 500. Cap dated 08-03-09. Ross generously gave this to me as a surprise on our first trade. I had been trying to get this for awhile. Thanks BP! Pours a muddy brown, murky with sediment, with a lasting creamy camel head. The aroma is not very aggressive on this bottle, which is faint sugary plums and cherry. I really expected more out of the aroma, along the lines of a Rochefort 10.  Creamy and slight evervescent mouthfeel. Initial flavor of yeast,  dried fruit...very earthy. In the middle I get some licorice and cinnamon. This transitions to a slight bitter and warming finish. I was expecting the alcohol to be hidden, it does come out in the finish.. As it warms, more brown sugar sweetness creeps out.  Great beer, no question. Worth the hype? Perhaps, but not in my book. Definitely not worth paying the absurd prices from  Belgianshopo or trading away your beer cellar. Get a Rochefort 10 or St Bernardus Abt 12 and keep the extra money. But thanks to Ross for giving me a chance to try the holy grail.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"

Aroma malt was clear caramel, bread. Some raisin and licorice like aroma. Notes of fig and plum as well. Amazingly complex aroma. Appearance was likewise incredible and very pleasing to have in the hand. Color was dark and yet golden like notes. Liquid was light sparkling, but very pleasing sparkling taste in mouth. Head was brownish. Flavor was heavy sweet but in a good way. Slightly bitter, but nothing overwhelming. Just enough to hold the sweet taste in balance. Sour flavour was very light. Maybe a bit of salty notes in the middle. Palate where the body was full full fulloverwhelmingly full and rich. Texture was thick and oily and creamy like. Carbonation is soft and the finish just levees you with the longest and greatest finishes ever. What a world class number one beer. This is why I drink beer; it can be such an amazing experience.

With such a high alcohol content, one would expect an overwhelming alcohol flavor, but it was masked as well as any beer Ive had.

2852,"2006-09-15",4.9,"This beer looked much like a cloudy root beer that picked up some straw towards the edges, but had a mossy green halo around the edges when held to the light. Also, there were a few flecks floating around. The dirty off white head looked a little like my carpet with uneven bubbles creating a pleasantly chaotic surface that didnt last for all that long.

Smelled of salty, flakey pastry that was creamy and doughy. Also included ideas of gooey cookie and/or bread dough with a sweet musky honey. Hell, it could even smell like baklava if you squinted right. Theres also some fruity notes of figs, cherries and plumbs. I was really astonished (as if I wasnt impressed by now) by the residual alcohol suggestion where my mind pointed out where the 10.2% should be, but my nose could only pick up its shadow. Very nice indeed. 

Tasted of creamy, milky caramel then picks up a pleasant tingly sensation that blossoms into an amazing syrup, peaches and pecans. Then there are also some playful light nips of hop that roll around my tongue, back and forth re-releasing little hints of a milky bread dough, honey and nuts in between the suppressive drops of dryness. Finishes like the pastry from the smell with some honey. As I exhale, I get an amplified, brilliant doughy yeast.

The mouth feel is light to medium and creamy with a brilliantly paired sandy feeling carbonation. Perfect!

When we left for dinner I couldnt help but order one of these with my meal. Pours a deep ruby brown colour with an off white foam of head. Earthy aroma with hints of rasin, brown sugar and spice. Complex with a cornucopia of flavours... berries, plums, rye bread, honey, malt and nuts. As sipped becomes sweet with a long spicy unoffensive yet bitter finish.

After losing one to Canada Customs in a trade, I wondered if Id ever get another shot at it, but thanks to a suggestion from Ross on a source, here it is. Dark ruby brown colour with an everlasting rocky, creamy, and rich tan head with lots of lacing. Dark fruit, chocolate covered cherries, brown sugar, toffee, orange peel, raisin, fig, and amber rum aroma. Brown sugar, toffee, and molasses flavours lead into dark chocolate, fruit, figs, raisins, and cherries which in turn give way to a light alcohol finish with more molasses, rum, and dark chocolate to top it off. Mouthfeel is remarkable  rich and full bodied yet soft and delicate, smooth and easy drinking yet substantial, warming but no sign of alcohol heat. Definitely worth the wait and a fitting tribute for my daughters 3 month birthday  one of these will hit the cellar to celebrate another one of her milestones 17-20 years down the road.

2852,"2006-09-02",4.9,"How do you review this beer? How do you rate a beer that many people believe to be the best beer in the world? With all the hype surrounding this beer and all the anticipation, (including the price tag), I had very high expectations. I was almost expecting to be disappointed as this beer has been pedestalled as ""the holy grail"" of beers. Truth is; it is deservingly in a league of its own. 

Appearance: Pours a deep brown color with a nice beige head that fades into a frothy cap and an attractive halo. It was surprising the head and lacing on a 10.2% ABV beer. 

Smell: The aroma is complex and sweet. Dark fruits like plums, figs and dates are all interwoven into a truly enticing aroma that smells only like Trappist Westvleteren 12 (Yellow Cap)! I was surprised at the amount of floral character this beer displayed.

Taste: The taste can only be described as tasting like Trappist Westvleteren 12 (Yellow Cap)! It is completely unique. There is a tartness surge on the front end, then a very mellow smooth silky vinous middle with caramel flavors that lead into what I might try to liken to figs and dates and toasted brown sugar malts; but it is really so well blended that is hard to isolate individual flavors. In the aftertaste, there is again a yeasty tart that maybe be similar to a splash of green apple, and a bit of alcohol warmth. I love the stinging character on the lips. It is not clear what causes that spicy stinging sensation (maybe the acidity) but it begs you to drink more. Truly though, I can only describe this as being in a league of its own!

Mouthfeel: Super freaking smooth and so creamy it is sinful! It is light and perfectly carbonated to be full and easy to drink at the same time.

Drinkability: Absolutely dangerous. I was pleased to share this beer with a couple of close friends, but I must say, a beer this big may never go down so easily! Is a $300 case out of the question? If it fits in your budget, absolutely go for it; you wont regret it. It goes down so dangerously easily its indescribable. Until next time someone shares a Westy 12 with me, I will keep a special place in my heart for this spectacular gem.

Hope this is helpful.

Grain, toasted chocolate toffee, vanilla, prunes, rasins, its definitely complex but I have to stick my nose in their a little to really get it.  Murky rasin brown in color, average off white head with lasting lacing.  Lightly sweet in flavor and finish, candi sugar, rasins, plums, cherries, oak, and the warmth of alcohol.

-------- Thanks to xnohatex for the sample straight from belgium bottled only about a month ago.  
Pours dark with a small off white head.  The aromas are very nicely balanced like everything else in this beer: plums, currants, raisins, brown sugar and dough.  At the first sip im struck: suprisingly medium to light body but a crazy amount of fizziness over the whole tongue.  The longer I hold it in my mouth, it almost becomes numb with the carbonation.  Drewbeerme described it as probably what it would be like to taste a little finger-lick of cocaine, i agreed.  Flavors followed with successive sips:  raisins, toffee, carmel, cinamon, oak, vanilla, clove, and alcohol all balanced so well (maybe even too balanced).  as the beer warmed it seemed to turn sweeter and the aromas and flavors turned more to chocolate and almond.  After a few sips of this i was suprised to feel heady very quickly.

Deep, caramel brown body with a long-lasting, creamy head.  The mellow malts and raisins slowly gave way to yeasty sweetness in the aroma.  I found this to be bright and lively on the tongue and warming in the throat.  The flavor was subtle and slightly tangy, with a tiny bit of barnyard in the finish??

Aroma is full of dark fruit like plum along with a hint of citrus. Theres quite a lot going on with the flavor in this one. Big fruity flavors mix with hints of almond and caramel. Tangy finish and warming alcohol. It may not be the best beer in the world but its damn close. If only this bottle was a 750mL.  I usually take some time drinking beers as big as this one but Ive noticed that I went through the first half of this one very quickly before forcing myself to savor the rest.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","Magjayran"
2852,"2006-07-26",3.5,"UPDATED: NOV 16, 2007 Smells of malts, faintly; has a peppery spice, like Westmalle Trippel, though less pronounced; very dark, rootbeer colored. Effervescence is standard for a Belgian Trappist ale. Maltiness approaching a German dopplebock. Everything is well balanced, reminding me of a smoothed out, more sophisticated version of Ayingers Celebrator Doppelbock. Sadly, theres no doubt in my mind that its overrated, due to its scarcity. It cost me 12 for one, small bottle in Brussels. After talking with the owner of Beer Mania, where I purchased it, he showed me a receipt of someone who ordered two bottles from London. The total cost was 193. Ridiculous!

Pours Dark with a two finger thick light tan head, that lasted until the last sip. The aroma is heavenly, belgian spices, yeast, citrus (orange peel), slight fruit, and alcohol. The flavor is ungodly, god damn smooth, spices, fruit, citrus, sweet, with a slight hoppy bitter finish.

2852,"2006-07-12",4.7,"Rating #2000... Another thank you to my GF for getting these for me.  Ive been staring at this bottle for six weeks, and now Im going to drink it... profound, no?  Hazy deep brown beer, orange highlights, yellow-tan head.  Very lacy and sticky.  Aroma of spices and mint over a massive malty aroma.  Orange rind, plums and dried cherries.  Beautiful rich spicy yeast with overtones of clove, cardamon and cinnamon.  flavour is amazing, sweet caramel, toast, and a rye-like mintiness up front with a lingering burnt sugar toastiness toward the end.  Fantastic jammy fruity flavour as well with plums, raisins, and dried cherries.  Honey dipped almonds.  Very warming finish.  Lingering sweet toastiness and clovey phenolics.  Lace sticks all over the chalice.  As it warms even more malty sweetness comes to the fore.  Lingering peppery flavour and herbal woodiness helps to counter all of the sweetness.  Brown sugar and toffee flavours are also noticible.  Luxurious palate, wheaty body.  I gave the top score to the Extra 8, but this is first rate.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
2852,"2006-07-10",4.2,"I want to say this beer is a victim of the hype, but then I look at all the top raters and all but one give it 4.4+, so then I feel a little stupid. I try another sip, try to dig deeper, but still come up blank. Great? Sure. World Class? Absolutely. Number 1??? But I digress...

For a start, let me say that this is my 500th rating, after a bit more than a year on the site; a milestone I thought I would never reach (I tend to get bored of things pretty quick), and certainly not this fast. Suddenly, 1000 seems very close. 

Only 20 ratings ago, I had no idea what I would choose for the big 500. Probably one the Speedways sitting in my basement. But, lo-and-behold, my fellow ratebeerian Hopscotch started a goofy contest which held the top prize of a Westy 12. #1. The Big Numero Uno. Hyped so fiercly that mail-order shops in Belgium manage to sell it for $25+ a bottle. Yikes! After all sorts of complications at the end of the contest, my hard work paid off (and believe me, looking through hundreds of pages of pictures of half-naked hot celebs to get a positive ID is HARD WORK!). Suddenly, #500 seemed like a clear choice (though I almost caved and drank it for #492 the day I got it).

Now, on to the beer. I couldnt have been more excited for this brew. The blank bottle and elegant cap just add to the allure. Of course... the best beer in the world is so small, odd, ridiculous, that it doesnt even have a label! I warmed the brew with my hands for a good 10 minutes, bringing it to around I believe 50F, popped it and poured it into my brand new, virgin Gouden Carolus challice. The pour was a beautiful thick brown, with a foamy biege head and enough solid crap to form a nice beige base. First smell was pretty bland, though as it warmed, I picked up strong bread (reminds me of Dulle Teve), cherry, fig, alcohol and chocolate. The flavor is more exciting, very smooth and relaxing, distinctly bready, with late licorice, more fig... and a big alcohol burn. Most mention that they see no alcohol, but I am getting quite a kick. I guess now would be the time to mention that this bottle is supposedly only 4 months old (feb 2006), if the article about a Westy vertical on this site is to believed -- the cap is dated 15.02.09. Many have said before that this beer is strongest after years in the cellar, and this tasting has lead me to believe that. Now I just need another bottle.

So, hyped or not?? Ill certainly throw it out there that I think your average beer taster wouldnt at all rate this higher than Roch 10, St.B 12, if it were a blind tasting, and provided they didnt already have the flavor profile locked in memory. Certainly, the three are distinct, but this just doesnt have the otherworldy prowess that its taken on on the site. So, yes, I think this beer has been hyped out of existence. Maybe for the truely discerning palates, it offers something above and beyond pretty much anything else out there. Or maybe, by the time its 3 or more years old, its developed in to the beast it is rumored to be. But, for now, well, its just another solid beer.

That, and I think Im going to cry, because my glass is nearly empty.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
2852,"2006-07-09",4.7,"Bottle: My second go round with this beer. And one that I absolutely refused to rate on memory. Pours a dark brown with a bit of haze, big off white head. Aroma was yeasty, floral, and fruity. Just a bit of alcohol was noticeable. Flavor, caramel, sweet and floral, with a beutiful fruity undertone to it. The finish is softly bitter with some more fruits. And just a touch of warming as it lingers in the mouth. Medium bodied with nice lacing.

While drinking this I couldnt stop grinning at how good this was. I had it once before about 8 months ago right as I was really getting started on this site. I loved it then. Some of the beers I had earlier on though just dont hold up anymore, but my god does this one keep its spot. If I could I would sip on this stuff for every waking moment, it is just so amazingly drinkable.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sliffy"
2852,"2006-07-09",3.7,"Poured with little head, murky brown. Has a spicy aroma with noticeable alcohol. I was kind of surprised by how prevalent the alcohol was in this beer. It really threw the balance off for me. Taste is good though- much more german hefe tasting than other belgians in that I detected clove spice and a bit of banana. Also plum/raisin and apple. Quite sweet, but spicy hop finish balances that nicely. Im glad that my friend was able to get one of these while studying in France.","minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","IPAndy"
2852,"2006-07-08",4.8,"UPDATED: OCT 24, 2008 Theres nothing supernatural about beer. You might say the monks of St. Sixtus harbor a metaphysical relationship through this beer, yet in itself it is but the sum of a very tangible - though nonetheless complex - brewing process. I suppose that may seem obvious, but I only fully understood the implications after drinking the Westvleteren 12. In some way I have always believed that one day I would drink a beer that couldnt be described in comparative terms, a beer that in the words of Hegel would aufheben. The reverie can never be utterly anulled, but certainly dimmed as it has by the disillusion of drinking such a strong candidate. Dont get me wrong, the Westvleteren Abt is an exceptional brew, but the fact that I can pinpoint its shifting nuances with precision leaves me with a sense of control that could not exist in my utopian nectar.


Westvleteren is no epigone and their Abt warrants careful scrutiny, beginning with its beautiful black velvet robe that radiates a clear crimson hue in the light. The praline pillow-like head evolves gracefully and slips through the lips with a delicate creamy touch. Wondrous scents of banana and dark sugars are immediately apparent. Rich caramel and molasses develop and with each sniff appears a refining shade: chocolate, coffee, fig, plum, red wine, licorice. The complexity is ever increasing and builds a rustic profile highlighted by hints of dust, soil, wood and apple that evolve with warming to reveal buttery raspberries, cinnamon, honey and progressively sweeter and fruitier tonalities. The first sip is equally enticing and coats the tongue in a slightly burnt chocolate bitterness that slowly unveils a sweet pear flavor, not unlike a bite of Poire Belle-Hélène. A soupçon of black pepper enhances the nutty coffee and dark malts which gradually smoothen to reveal raisins and cherries. The finish is surprisingly hoppy, far more than most Belgian brewers allow, but this touch is not unwelcome and adds a certain identity to an almost excessively well balanced beer. My specimen was just a few weeks old, but Ill be aging the rest of my bottles to observe this beers evolution. Perhaps its maturation will yield what I so deeply pursue.


Re-rate: As my bottles age I am beginning to understand the mystique behind Westvleteren’s Abt. Between three and five years of age this is a beer that truly radiates perfection. I had to increase my rating.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Its very dark and boozey, like a refined dessert where the sweetness is limited and balanced. It still has a nice light fruity quality over the tounge  with a good punch of booze in the middle with a fairly sweet finish.

The tastes were dark and interesting. I got a good bite when it first hit my mouth that gave way to a very strong herbal taste(almost tobacco). The finish was sweeter and smooth.

2852,"2006-06-02",4.7,"UPDATED: JUL 14, 2007 Re-rate, 7/07 in a horizontal alongisde St. Bernies 12 and Roche 10. Bottle courtesy fozapd/Scott, stamped 18.01.09, about 1.5yrs old. Pour was brownish with a tannish colored off-white head, not great retention, but not as week as the Westv 8 on the same night, yet inferior to both St Bs 12 and Roche 10. Aroma and flavor of caramel, brown sugar, choco, lingering spices, stronger version of 8. Alcohol more detectable than with the 8, liquor/scotch type flavors, is this bottle over-aged, not as rich as once remembered. Honestly, against the Roche 10 and St. B 12, this came in last. Numbers dropping a little, but still an average of my three experiences. Thanks, Scott, for contributing to this wonderful horizontal! Excellent stuff. Original ratings follow: Poured a nice medium brown with a huge head that laced superbly while drinking. Sedimentation was under control. Aroma was primarily bready, yeasty, spicey. The high ABV was barely noticeable in the flavor or aroma. Rich deep flavor, and distinct from the St. Bernies and Roche 10. There was a true beer barley and bready base coming through (ie. it didnt feel like they sugared this one up to the point of hiding the beerness... I dont know how to describe that). My first Quad Belgian, where not just the dark fruits, candy sugar, and spices come through, but some chocolate (slight burnt touch) was noticeable too. Definitely a peppery finish (on second tasting / re-rate, I didnt repeat this one). Immediate aftertaste was the candy sugar (a sweetness), which then turned to a surprising lowly hop bitterness after 10-15 seconds or so. Mouthfeel was carbonated and slightly less heavy than a stout. Very enjoyable, of course. Would love to put Roche 10, St. Bernies 12, and this one side by side one night and have at it. Thanks to E for the trade and Westy 12 experience. The re-rate was on a bottle (stamped 09.08.08) served at De Vrede across the street from the abbey.","","User37895"

A silky smooth beer that, despite its alcoholic depth, is more than drinkable.  I was expecting large hits of sweetness countered by larger doses of peppery burn.  I got neither.  It is a well-played balance of power between the two.  And neither struggles to dominate.  I suppose we could argue as to what makes the best beer in the world.  But why?  It might be something that hasnt been drunk yet.  So lets get working on that.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Fantomas23"

Pours a hazy dark chestnut red...if you hold it to the light you see some nice greens.  Big old belgian cream colored head with tons of lacing.  Aroma is very remiscent of St Bernard 12, except maybe a bit more balance.  Tons of dried plum and raisin...spice...vegetables...yeast...bread.  Flavor was incredibly balanced.  Im not going to trash it because it didnt quite live up to the best beer in the world, but I will say that out of all the trappist and BSAs Ive had, this one has got to be the biggest crowd pleaser.  Tons of rich dried fruit and candy sweetness to make it thoroughly enjoyable, enough belgian yeast to remind you that the brew you are drinking comes from a long line of tradition, and enough complex spice, bitterness, and veggie flavors to keep you thirsting for one more sip.  Mouthfeel is very smooth and similar to roch 10.  Now I cant say that it is worth all the trouble to acquire this beer over roch 10, bernard 12, or some of my other belgian friend, but if this were readily available...even at a similar price of $13+...I would no doubt stock up.

It gained some further depth of flavor aspects as it neared room temperature.  Mouthfeel is creamy and full-bodied with moderate carbonation.  My only negative critique is that there was a little too much alcohol flavor in the finish.  Not the best beer Ive ever had though.  I actually rated the 8 equal, and the Blonde just a tenth lower.

Its like wine, more than anything.

Mahogany under a huge off white head that slowly falls and leaves thick sheeted lace.

The aroma is an incredible mix of fresh bread dough made with cinnamon, raisins, dates and dark cherries with some peppery warmth from the alcohol. Brown sugar from the malts and suggestions of licorice and a sprinkling of powdered chalk. Wow!

Tastes malty upfront then fades into ripe dark fruits such as cherries, plums, and ripe red grapes all dipped in brown sugar. The middle brings a tart flavor followed by some more suggestions holiday fruit cake. Not the cheap fruit cake we all hate to recieve at Christmas but rather like the one made from scratch with a little apple liquer that has that yeasty just pulled from the oven flavor.

2852,"2006-03-06",4.5,"Bottled. Rating #500. Ive waited quite patiently for this one. It has been in my cellar since september, and I decided when I bought it that I should save it for rating #500. I think I have entered my 499 beers quite rapidly, just over six months, but the waiting has been way to long, and the beer has been staring at me every time I went to get another beer in the cellar. Now, as I am to open it, I am a little bit nervous. Its not my virgin-sample of a Westy 12, Ive had it two or three times before, I am just nervous that it might be bad in any way, or that I might get disappointed. After all, my taste-buds has evolved a little since my first rating. It has a BB date of 28.02.08, so it is ok in that way, hope it is in any other way too. Well, off goes the cap. The first aroma is very vinous and oaked. Then, when its poured, black currant, caramel, dried fruits, light alcohol, spices and a light yeastiness comes through. You dont get it much more complex than this. It looks gorgeous, dark reddish-brown and sparkling, and with some sediments if you prefer that. It has probably the most dense, lasting head that Ive seen so far, beige in color, and huge. The flavor is rich, with caramel, candi-sweetness, malt, spices, bitterness, cherry and alcohol. Too much alcohol, I think. There are lots of other beers masking the 10% ABV much better, but it is not an unpleasant alcohol-level. The body is full and it has a sweet and bitter finish that is quite long. The flavor and finish is rounded of as the beer warms up, and my starting temperature of 10°C was too cold, especially for the finish to step forward. It turned out I had no reason to be nervous, the beer probably deserves its first place on Ratebeer, but I expected that I could give it a higher score. A beer that matches aroma and flavor even better will hopefully come my way some day, and then maybe the perfect 5 will be given. (060306)","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

Amazing taste of cherry, chocolate and many other flavors, too complex to be able to identify.  If one can call any beer liquid silk this would be it.

(Bottled.  03/2006).  This batch seems ""green"".  Body is relatively thin compared to past experiences with this brew.  All the same major notes as described below but the body definitely seems thinner warranting a slight ""downgrade"" in the overall impression.
(Earlier notes)  Pours dark, dark brown. Complex aromas of dried fruits, nuts, and biscuits.  An intense flavor that emerges as it warms up.  A wonderful experience to be sure.  Vintages vary ... a ""4"" would be a ""4.5"" for some years and something less in others.","USA","smcd"

Many things in life do not come close to matching their ""hype"". Fortunately, I feel this one goes beyond the considerable buzz surrounding it.

Pours into my trappist glass a deep mahogany brownish red. Somewhat murky, a slight, off white head crowns the top, a foreshadow of the weblike dense lacing. Initially, the nose is rather vinous, like a medium red, with some cherry notes peeking through. As it warms, a far more complex aroma emerges. Notes of dark fruits - raisin and black cherries - shine through. The cornucopia of scents is almost overwhelming, too much going on to pinpoint all the complexities.

Finally, I lift the glass and draw my first sip. Light Muscatine grapes cascade across my tongue to start the show, followed by a textbook quad fruitiness, highlighted by black cherry, prune and some light molasses. All this flies by you as the finish approaches, a lovely sweet, slightly tart mildly dry epilogue.

All too soon, I see the tiny logo at the bottom of my glass, signaling the beginning of the end. Fully warmed, the alcohol becomes just slightly more apparent, and some of the initial winelike notes have faded to a warm, sweet end.

Aroma is a phenolic fruit and floral quality, with a hint of lavender and honeysuckle, with a strong fresh blast of raspberries, almost candied, with cream. Bottom, with yeast, has a more subdued and dusky aroma, with raisins, yeast and light hazlenut. Flavor is classic fruity quad, that as it warms develops into a much broader level of complexity. A real strong edge of fresh squeezed orange juice and a tinge of the fresh raspberrie continues. Dense flavor, with sweet candi sugars, warm yeast and a hint of lime peel and juniper berries. A good strong dose of abbeyian fruitcake on the backend, laced with silken chocolate swirls. A smack of rich mulled apple cider, with light spice. A hint of nutmeg. Its as delecate and deft as a rich creamy port sauce, over quickly seared kobe beef, with italian cherries in syrup. Mingled in is a hint of wild mushroom. All poured into a buttery crust of pastry. Palate is perfect and exquisite, dazzling the tounge, hiding any alcohol and carrying all these flavors most deftly. Obviously good. It held up to my expectations and deserves one of my Top 10 spots, but this beer is <i>perfect</i>. Its not startlingly different, just amazingly crafted.

2852,"2006-01-31",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 1, 2006 For my 100th rating on RB, Ive chose the emblematic Westy for the icon it represents. Considered by RBeerians aggregated opinions as being the best beer in the world.. to my experience, either Ive not developed my taste enough and Im no worthy of this beer or my expectations were simply unrealistic. Also, it could be because this beer its a little overrated being the best of the hardest world-renowned Trappist beers to get. 
Now why? Good question. I admit that the dark burgundy brown color with that fluffy/bubbly tan head, those very nice laces, hunks of yeast make it a definite 5 appearance: no question there. That extremely complex fruity nose going to an array of deep/rich fruits.. cherry, prunes, pears ..alcohol esters.. caramelized malts surrounded by a deep damp cellar impression, confirmed in the mouth while being rich, round, and long..

A very good beer but I havent had that woahh-hiii (© 2005, Yowie) impression that I was expecting like when I had the Cantillon gueuze 1996, the Speciaal Brouwsel 20.. or even the Orval and the Avec les bons voeux..

Odd. Might be because I had this beer alone at my place while I had most of the beers I rated so far with such nice people, intensifying the experience of every beer.. People like Rastacouere, MartinT, tiggmtl, Olivier_MTL and ClakVV among others that I dont have the chance to see as often. 

I have a few left and Ill give this beer another try..

This beer is one that should mellow even more with age but I actually prefered the fresher bottle I had about 2 years ago.

Im glad I waited, this beer is very deserving of the 1000th rating.  Pours a very very deep amber- mostly brown and moslty cloudy even when I left the dreggs in the bottle. A very large light beige head  is created upon the pour with a crapload of sticky lacing on the sides of the glass.  Aroma is truly unlike any other beer I have had- not even the St Bernardus can compare. Aroma of light earthy and spicy hints with light barnyard notes.  Next the fruity esters from the yeast come into play, and then finish with a crapload of sweet fruity malt- lots of caramel, chocolate, and special B.  Almost a musty hint in the end of the aroma as well.  Flavor is mostly sweet malt in the front with caramel chocolate malst in the middle- intermingling with hops and even a touch of tobacco.  Good hop bitterness in the end- almost an earthy-hop character.  Finishes a bit dry but still a lot of complex malt sweetness.  Full mouthfeel with a smooth finish.

2852,"2005-12-08",4.9,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2006 Ive tasted thousands of beers in the last 23 years,  and I have no doubt that this is the best Ive tried. I first tried it on the only sunny day in my tour of Belgium in 2000, sitting outside of Het Spannekopke restaurant (a must-try if in Brussels).  When the waiter came to check on us, he saw my smile and said ""I know,  I know...""  Since then Ive had it at home and at the Belgian beer festivals at Carlsbad Pizza Port. Most recently tried it alongside Rochefort 10 at home. Dark brown-burgundy in color, with a thick, rocky head. Very malty, but balanced with bitter notes of charcoal and a slight smokiness in addition to the hops. Gets better as it warms towards room temperature. Sweet toffee, molasses, and candy sugar flavors fill the palate.  A delight. (After rating, I went through and read the lowest ratings of this.  Several people mention the high cost.  When I bought it, both at the restaurant and at the bottle store, the price wasnt out of the ordinary for a trappist ale.  I suppose that, since 2000, the beer has grown so in reputation and popularity that it has risen in price.  A rare find, and hence, expensive, if these stories of its expense are to be believed.)","San Diego, California, USA","Kingsley"

Served at approximately 12 celsius in my Westvleteren goblet.  Poured a lively dark amber-brown with a decent off-white foamy head - the last 10% of the pour showed a fair bit of tiny black particles (tasty!).  Initial aroma pounded my hindbrain:  yeast; sweet dough, strong fruits, hint of wine, roast malt, roast nuts - more emerged as it opened, other fruits, caramel sweetness, earthy tones.  And oh, the flavour - all of the above, but with a restrained bitterness - alcohol & hops, perhaps? - keeping it in balance.  Each taste had a different mouthfeel as more and more elements vied for my attention - mouthfeel was full-bodied, not flat or carbonated - just complex.  Ultimately I have to rate this a 5.0 - its by far the best thing Ive ever tasted; while there have been a couple of imperial stouts that are up there, this is definitely the holy grail of beers.  My only regret making this my 500th rating is I cant ALSO make it my 1000th!  *note - re-rated down to 4.9 because on reflection I cant in good conscience claim anything is perfect - perfection is to be sought after, never attained.","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"

2852,"2005-10-19",4.3,"Bottle Inspection: Cap has a date, but I can only read the first two numbers: 11/08/? Cap is worn on one side and the bottle has the American label.

Aroma: Rich malt nose, hints of fruit, mainly fig, and a good dose of spicy alcohol.

Appearance: Clear tan amber glass with a good cover of off white head that lasted as a collar (impressive given the abv), but didnt lace. Last pour was murky with a fair amount of blackish sludge (you KNOW I drank it all). 

Flavor: Belgian yeast and dark fruit are the main flavors with a touch of almond liquor (Frangelica). There is a hint of the fresh Christmas present taste that I get from Rochefort 10 as well. A well put together taste overall and enjoyable.

Mouthfeel: Lighter than expected but silky smooth texture

Overall Impression: Impossible to be objective with this one. In some ways I was a touch disappointed. I imaged angels dancing on my tongue and some sort of beer epiphany that would allow me some sort of deep beer insight into the nature of things. 

Its just a beer. A good beer, heck, a Great Beer! But, beer. 

That said, it is massively drinkable and if the monks lived next door, Id drink this daily! Im not going to fly all the way to Belgium just to drink this though.

I did not take notes, didnt want to make the experience too much like work, or interrupt the far-reaching conversation. But enuff about me, on to the beer: Smelled a bit like apple cider, but more yeasty and dark. Palate was thick, tasted so complex I couldnt pick out any one predominant flavor, loved the sharpness contrasting with the sweetness. If there are hops in this beer, I missed em. I quite like hops, so its hard for me to score this as a 5, but thats splitting hairs with a beer this good.

I popped the cap on this one, and the beer immediately rose to the top and started pouring over the edge.  Not good!  I have to admit that the first thing I noticed about this was that the aroma was a little light.  I guess thats a result of heightened expectations.  Once it warmed up a bit, the aroma became divine.  Dark fruits (fig, prune, cherry), chocolate, toffee, licorice, cherry cordials and somewhat vinous.  Every sniff peeled back another layer.  As it reached room temp, the aroma became very thick and chewy, just like an impy stout.  After the first sip, I knew I was in for something extraordinary.  
Chocolate, raisin, fig, prune, cherry, licorice, subtle spices, toffee and even a small puff of smoke.  The finish was somewhat dry but very silky smooth.  I find it amazing that something so robust (as in the 10%) can be so delicate, but thats the nature of this one.  Its in perfect harmony with the world.","Windsor, Connecticut, USA","SwedeDog"

I had been looking for this beer for a while when I finally got hold of it.
Chocolaty dark and dim appearance w/ very little carbonation or head.

If one were rating in terms of complexity, this would have to make the top 10 beers of the world. It was an impressive blend of fruit notes such as peach and cherry combined with darker flavors of toffee and bourbon. I can see why this merits some hype, but its not my favorite in terms of flavor. Perhaps its the Belgian yeast that gave it the funkiness that just didnt do it for me. Still, for complexitys sake, I give this an A rating.""

So this is the almight Westy 12... Pours a bit (actually a lot) thinner than I expected... Dark mahogany tint with a thin head that clings nicely to the glass.  Aroma is cinnamon with a bit of toffee.  Palate is a bit thin, but the flavor makes up for it.  Raisin, yeast, toffee, caramel, and a tinge of vanilla round out the flavors.  Aftertaste is brief with a quick flurry of alcohol, but the latter leaves with a slight evanescence on the tongue.  Leaves the drinker wanting more.  RETASTE:0  Flavor is much more cohesive than last when I tasted it.  The raisin is less prominent, and there seems to be more malted chocolate in the drink.  A bit more bitter than last time, and that isnt necessarily a bad thing.  Still, for my money, Westy 8 blows this one away.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"

Sweet, but tempered caramel taste with  darkish brown murky color.  Extremely complex in flavor, nose and palate. It has a smatter of four or five styles of beer  (as far as alcohol, taste and bitterness and balance): smooth then spicey and sweet then bitter on the tail; well balanced with hidden alcohol.  I guess hundreds of years of perfected brewing and high standards will do that for a beer.  Hard to get a hold of and very expensive, but well worth the investment.  If you get a chance to go to Belgium I highly recommend you make the trek and by a few cases to bring home.  Heaven in a bottle.  The best balanced as far as alcohol and taste.

2852,"2005-06-29",4.1,"Rating #300
Well, the waiting is over and I finally allowed myself to drink one. Looked beautiful, with a rusty, caramel-red body under a  rocky, large-bubbled, khaki head. A lot of character-adding, chunky particulates as well. Aroma was potent and spicily malted, with dark fruits and apple amongst a myriad of others. Flavor was rich and explosively fruity with cherry and pear coming through after a highly sweet-malted start. Full-bodied with a great deal of alcohol to warm the stomach, throat and nose. Very good, but Id rather have a La Trappe Quad or a St. Bernardus 12... mainly due to Westys high cost and limited availabilty, but also because I feel that St. Bernardus is more flavorful & complex, and La Trappe is more user-friendly. To each their own.

2852,"2005-06-28",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2006 Saw all the talk about Westly 12 lately, so went to a rerate, just different year.  
2002 bottle- Many of the same characteristics Yeast, rum, figs, and raisins are there. Palate is incredibly smooth, very different from the 98 bottle, but also on the room temp side.  The complexity change alone as it warms is remarkable.  Truly sets the bar for all other beers. 

1998 bottle -

Careful pour, just enough for a small head which recedes slowly.  Dark brown with ruby hues. 
Aromas of nougat, sweet bread dough, rum, and figs. More complex every second, but cant hold off on my first sip.

Doughy, yeasty, the layers keep coming through.  Midway malt prominent with subtle hints of pastry and overripe prune.  Almost a bit cloying, my only complaint.  Carbonation is a bit on the low side which might explain the mouthfeel.

Finishes long.  Lingering toffe/doughy tastes coat your tongue just to tease you that its all gone...

2852,"2005-06-28",4.1,"Bottled.  Pours a deep, but penetrable, brown with red edges with a small white head that dropped quite fast.  Aroma was of candy and dried fruits: raisin, cherry, figs.  Some bready malt and caramel sweetness also came through in the nose.  Flavor was sweet of crystal malt and Belgian candy sugar, with tons of fruitiness and spice.  Hops were there for bittering but only bittering as I got none in the flavor.  Alcohol was more apparent than I think is reasonable, both upfront and in the warm finish.  Body was moderately thick and it went down smooth with slightly more carbonation than I would have liked.

2852,"2005-06-27",4.3,"Bottle 33cL.  I was sitting around at a tasting Sunday, when we were about to start up the main event (side by side Dark Lord vs. Speedway).  Glenn (a beeradvocate fellow) was about to leave after the imperial stout showdown, so he generously interrupted us and said, ""Hey, before we move on, is there anyone here who hasnt had Westy 12.""  A couple of us, myself included, replied, ""Why no, Glenn, why do you ask?""  At which point he proceeded to pull an unlabeled, yellow-capped bottle of this from his cooler, crack it and serve.  Helluva guy.  Dark brown pour, with little whilte head.  Aroma is initally alcohol dominant, but gives way quickly to immense amounts of dried fruits.  The yeast esters are just incredible -- cherries, dates, figs, but mainly raisins.  Spices come through, too.  Cloves and nutmeg mix in with the alcohol.  The flavor is equally complex and interesting.  Raisins dominate, but there are massive amounts of other dried fruits begging to be identified and savored.  Caramel malt is there in force as well.  Unfortunately the alcohol flavor is as strong as the alcohol smell -- it has to be looked past.  The mouthfeel is oily and thick, but the alcohol keeps it clean on the finish.  I docked its aroma and flavor for the over-present alcohol, and the overall simply because Im not sure it lived up to the incredible hype of the worlds best.  Incredible, absolutely.

2852,"2005-06-27",5.0,"UPDATED: MAR 31, 2009 (Bottle 33 cl) Dark brown with only a small beige head. Extremely complex with notes of plums, raisins and perhaps some chocolate as well. Starts sweetish but ends with a fig-like driness. Hops are present but only to balance things, they never dominate. Westvleteren 12 is a revelation, a truly heavenly experience - the kind of beer that explodes with flavours in your mouth giving you new impressions each and every time.

It is hard for me to discribe fully what this beer is like, The aroma is like, rich deep amazingness that is very similar to all the trapist ales, malt and sweet and dark fruits. Taste, mmmmmmmmmmmm, the taste. Rich sweet, fruits, citrus, rum and raisin, malt, alcohol, and about 40 other things ever second. However, i cant help but think its lacking something, more body i think. This is a very very good beer, your can drink a few of them too, if u can get them, unlike alot of quads. Pleased to have been given the opertunity to try it and will be aging the other 2 for a while, to see what goodness i can get out of that.

Aroma left nothing to be desired... dark fruits (plums, raisins), tannins, bread/yeast, spices..  The wonderful complexity makes the taste buds work overtime to appreciate this brew.  Starts vinous, and works through the yeast and spices to the raisins and honey as it makes its way to the throat.  Creamy & coated the mouth perfectly.

This is rather aromatic, but slightly subdued.  A tad fruitier than St. Bernardus 12.  Hazy cola-color with a long lasting creamy off-white head and nice lacing.  Starts vinous and sweet--almost like raisins and plums dipped in honey.  This gradually turns into a warm roasted flavor with hints of chocolate.

Sweet, overly ripe plums are the first thing I taste, followed by some pears and then hints of chocolate, nuts and even some spiciness.  A caramelized brown sugariness dominates the flavoring.  Just a touch of a bitter finish keeps this from being too sweet though.  The aftertaste is of raisins and nuts.  There is a strong warming alcohol presence throughout that only adds to the velvety smoothness.

Second drink brought on the plums, raisins and chocolate.  As I continue drinking I am noticing many different flavors such as caramel, burnt oak, yeast, nuts, cloves and much more that I cant Identify.. Medium mouthfeel with low carbonation and a medium alcohol burn.  I can say that this may be one of the most complex beers I have ever had. It may be a tie between this and orval.

2852,"2005-05-12",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 23, 2006 A Mes rate: 
This particular bottle was rated at Lowlander and that was also the place where I had my first bottle thanks to Duffs insitance. Aroma is vanilla, sugar and caramel with some chocolate and dark fruits. Red grapes and raisins too. Plus something that I can only describe as playdough. In fact it is reminiscent of all the best things you have ever sniffed at. Appearance is so very very close to perfection. Deep almost black mahogany red body and just the right amount of off white head and lace. Only reason it gets a 4 from me is that the head always dies just that little bit too soon but it is clearly the most inviting ""drink me I am gorgeous"" looking beer there is. Ok, what do I say about the flavour? Chocolate, cream, vanilla, raisins, pudding, a little biscuit, mazipan and just a touch of spice and malt. Finish is head and shoulders above everything else I have ever tried. I am not drunk, I will stand by this statement. A wonderful gentle warmth from the alcohol, more caramel (but more like toffee this time), just a dab of spice and also some cardboard and leather. Unbelievable length. Nothing has ever left me demanding another sip or being so sorrowful as you drain the last drops as this beer. On top of all this it gets you very very drunk indeed. I have been lucky enough to have had sessions on this and it is truely legendary. Nothing has ever satisfied me so consistently as this always does. Full bodied, superbly balanced, complex in every department. Think of a superlative and its in this drink somewhere. This is not hype it is every bit as good as they say.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

2852,"2005-05-01",4.8,"UPDATED: DEC 28, 2010 After walking by my secret stash of Westvleteren bottles for about a year, I figured this past Saturday was a good time to finally sit down and rate them.  Pours out brown with a small tan head that lingers throughout the tasting creating gentle patterns of lacing on the chalice.  Smell is of bananas, butterscotch, raisins, prunes,  and toffee.  Taste is of nuts, caramel, apples, celery and licorice.  Excellent mouthfeel with a great amount of carbonation despite the small head brought forth by the pour.  Each taste seems to linger in the mouth for an eternity.

1986 bottle sampled 2/1/07

Pours flat with only a sparse hint of bubbles one might find in a glass of wine.  Smells of alcohol, dark fruit, oak, leather, hints of vanilla.  Tastes of chewy toffee, caramel, bourbon, raisins, chocolate and oak.  No sherry notes to speak of which is a surprise and a testament to this beer.  Subtle elements of spice are present and with only a hint of warming alcohol, this is dangerously drinkable.  Finishes with some celery and lots of rich chocolate.  Palate is reminiscent of maple syrup and is rich and velvety.  This was a surprising treat, but as good as it is at 21, it is definitely past its prime and is best enjoyed at 1, 5 or even 10 years old.","Connecticut, USA","Cletus"

2852,"2005-04-30",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 3, 2005 #100 rating. Bottle at the Hop Leaf in Chicago after the Dark Lord release.  Poured into a tulip, a nice mahogany brown with an average size white head that lasted.  Yeasty sweet, fruity vinous raisin aroma which got more complex as it warmed.  Noticable alcohol in the aroma.  After 10 minutes, I finally decide to take a drink, this taste lasts for a while and changes as it goes down.  My first notes on the flavor say: Good beer.  Chewy goodness.  Then I try for a minute or two to figure out what Im tasting...stuff like vinous dates, brown sugar, and a bunch of other stuff I couldnt pick out because I decided to just sit back and enjoy it.

2852,"2005-04-29",4.3,"Thanks to Lachesis for sending this one to me from Belgium. Aged for six months after I received it. Poured muddy brown with a huge off white head. The head retention on this beer is quite ridiculous only to be out done by the lacing this brew leaves.  Heavily carbonated.  Aroma is a sweet, bread, banana pudding, yeast, and a combination of fruits. Has a thick silky mouthfeel that is quite superb. I am not even sure what exactly I tasted. There was just so much going on that it was difficult for me to isolate any one flavor. Definately spiced with a combination of cherry, grape, plum, apricot, banana, peach, berries, and bread. The spices keep the sweetness from overly dominating. There is a slight alcohol warming sensation in the finish, but it is hidden very well under the fruit attack. Will definately need more of this to figure it out.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","eboats"

rating and this did not dissapoint. Nothing less than perfection in every regard, its greatness goes well beyond my words. This and the Rochefort 10 have a unique silky mouthfeel which sets them apart from the rest, only the Westy 8 comes close.

The smell is dirt-like with hints of alcohol, raisin, yeast, and that Belgian horse-hair flavor common in many.  Flavor has some sweet dark candy sugar up front with a raisin/plum flavor coming in later. Very warming as the alcohol hits you pretty quick but is not overwhelming in the aftertaste as a sweetness re-enters. Some aging will do this beer well, but I am surprised by its world class rating since it doesnt seem as complex as the Westy 8.","New Lenox, Illinois, USA","HopsOrDie"

Hazy copper-brown color with a lively, fizzy, off-white and thin head.  Beautiful lacing as the experience progresses.  Aroma is chocolate, prunes, coriander, nutmeg and sugar-brazed walnuts.  Flavor?  Delicious.  Flavor was a rotating sequence of caramel, nuts and toffee.  Subtle carbonation and wonderful malt complexion.

I decided that i would wait to crack this beauty until i set a personal best in the pole vault.  well, friday i jumped 171"" and today i just finished my bottle of westy 12.  the cap was best by 10.03.07 meaning march 10, 2007 so, this was just over a year old.  this was amazing. It poured into my westy glass a pleasing brown, with lots of floaties and an ample sized head that fades a bit while a thin layer exists until the end leaving some nice lace on the sides of the glass.  the smell just said ""drink me"".  it was sweet and yeasty.  the first sip made me want to just suck down the entire glass, but i restrained myself and enjoyed the rest over the next 40 minutes.  the taste included a bread, candy, and fruit.  there was a distinct tartness in the middle and a nice bitterness toward the end rounding out all the wonderful flavors.  alcohol was not present hardly in the taste, but the warming in the finish was very welcome.  if you have not tried this yet, somehow acquire a bottle--mail order, trade, you should try this.  that being said, this may be the best beer i have tried to date.  not one that i would drink every day, too expensive now hard to get(and probably too heavy) to be a favorite, but this is so artful.  as satisfying as a 7 course meal.  i am glad that i got to try westy 12.  and i look forward to someday drinking a beer that will surpass this in quality if that is possible.","Saint Louis, Missouri, USA","SkyinBrian"
2852,"2005-04-23",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 6, 2006 Ill keep quiet as to where I actually got to sample this beer, as I dont want to get anyone in trouble, but it was very kind of the person to do so and I thank them for it. Poured a lovely dark brown with a small tan head.  Aroma of plum and spice - almost like a very nice warmed piece of plum cake - very unique and inviting.  The taste again was dominated by plum and spice - Im having a hard time describing it - it was very rich a dessert like, almost like a fine after dinner port.  The alcohol is very present but only adds to the overall taste.  This was truly a lovely beer, but only one I could have a sample of after dinner once in a while.

It definitely has a small batch, hand/craft-brewed taste.  Rich caramely alcohol on the nose which is repeated in the flavor along with dark, sweet fruits (figs, dates, and prunes).  Has a well-rounded and smooth mouth feel across its wide ranging flavor profile.  Very complex all around.  A very nice trappist ale with a homemade feel.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

Whatever the story of this ubiquitiously rare beer, its not pleasant to look at, a residue-filled, muddy brown with a white film for a head.  The aroma is darkly sweet, malt mashed with dark dry fruits, raisins and prunes and dates... and a lurking alcohol presence.  The taste is excellent - yeasty and fruity and toasty and laced with alcohol - sweet but well-balanced.  The finish is a long, dry alcoholic one.  I see that tradition seems to dictate that I rate this higher than I am today, but this is the best I can do despite the fame of this ale.

2852,"2005-04-13",4.8,"Beer 500. Pours a very cloudy, very yeasty dark brown, similar to the color of the bottle its been housed in.  When held to light some orange and red show.  Oodles of yeast.  Head is everlasting off-white froth that has dozens of bubbly strings rising from the sides of the glass.  Leaves an excellent lacing. When viewed from the side, the beer is like a starry night with particles floating and shooting all over the place. Quite unlike anything Ive ever seen. Smell is strong and wafts across the room all by itself.  Powerfully fragrant, exhibiting caramel, roasted malt, fresh prunes, dark grapes, slight chocolate and raisins all in perfect proportion.  Taste is well crafted and of perfect thickness and viscosity. Coats tongue long enough to leave behind flavors of roasted malt balanced with pit fruits. No misused or maligned flavors. Alcohol is recessed in taste for nearly 11% and does not bother the palate in any way.  This beer certainly has an excellent reputation that precedes it and admittedly that worried me about rating it. How do you rank something that is supposedly one of, if not THE greatest beers in the world. Well, after drinking it I have to say it is great and Ive never had a Belgian of better overall quality, taste, appearance and aroma. I cant say that it was spectacularly ground-breaking or that it reformed my impression of beer, but it did perform what it was supposed to for its style, and it did so magnificently.  For now, this beer is king.","Cochabamba, BOLIVIA","JonR888710"
2852,"2005-04-11",4.7,"Thanks to beerhandy I was finally able to try this one. I was not disappointed. It is neck and neck with the Rochefort 10. Thanks alot. I couldnt believe how fast that I got this.","USA","brkc"
2852,"2005-04-10",4.8,"So, the time has come. In approximately 14 hrs, my senior paper is due. I have 24 pages, no footnotes, intro, or conclusion. I should hit about 40 pages (including coversheet and bibliography). So, I sit down with the monster, the king, Westy 12. It pours a golden brown, settling to a deep brown-red in my glass, with a big offwhite head that is peppered with little yeast particles. The smell is intoxicating. Roasted coffee, toast, white wine, bread, fruit rollups. This is definitely 8s bigger brother. Very vinous nose. Taste is huge. Similar to Bernardus, but more going on. Its epic. Last night I was discussing how I wasnt sure that I really care for dark Belgians. This may be the exception that proves the rule. THe taste is very yeasty and fruity at the same time. I get wine at first, almost like bread soaked in wine. Through the middle and at the finish a pleasing bitterness comes through. In between the middle and finish, tamarind and unsweetened tea marry together to form one of the best tastes Ive gotten from Belgian. This is indescribable. This time, the beer begins sweet and moves into the tea flavor once again. The alcohol warms my insides. While this is not my favorite beer of all time, I cannot find anything within this beer that detracts. Is this perfection?","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"

Lovely aroma of dark dried fruits, brown kandij sugar, vintage fortified wine. Hints of oak, leather and mild spices. The medium sweet and complex flavour has also notes of dark dried fruits, oak, brown kandij sugar and mild spices, followed by fairly distinct hops. Best beer in the world? - dunno, but its a darn good one, thats for sure. Original rating: 330 ml bottle, bought at Pivni Galerie, Prague. Hazy dark reddish brown colour, enormous tan head. Lovely complex aroma of fruits, oak, leather and spices. Flavour is surprisingly bitter - hops of course, but also dead yeast cells? Leaves a not entirely pleasant bitter aftertaste on the back of my tongue. Elements of oak, caramel, toffee and spices. Warming mouthfeel, as expected.

2852,"2005-03-07",4.9,"Lost on my way through Belgium one clear, crisp, late winter evening, hope almost shattered, I stumbled across an aging man on the side of a dirt road. Cloaked, meditating, he weilded a glowing chalice, and muttered in a language I do not speak, but understood to mean, take this glowing chalice, and become one with our beer. I was nearly blinded by a glowing pillow of froth, and holding the glass to my nose, it became enshrouded in rings of trees bearing plums, burgundy grapes, hop bushes sprouting vanilla, strands of pale vienna malt, rum barrels and butterscotch. In a haze, I tipped the chalice to my lips, and a sea of velvet washed away first the tongue, then mouth, throat, stretching through to the soul. Vaguely I recall the monk gazing gleefully through my enraptured eyes, swept away by the 12, the most sacred of numbers, the 12 gods of Westvleteren. When I awoke in their humble monastery, a tinge of sorrow overcame me, for I may never experience joy this deep again. But I soon realized that I was fortunate to have had this experience at all, and was ready to continue the journey...

Flavour is sweet, very smooth and nicely carbonated you can hardly tell that it is 10%.

2852,"2005-01-19",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2007 #100, I got my crown! Thanks to JCapriotti and the Milwaukee RB action squad for this beer.  11.2oz. NB Worthy glass. 60°.  The beer fizzed out of the bottle when I popped the cap and continued to fizz slightly. Poured muddy chocolate brown with a 1/2"" off white head. As the head subsides, the foam rings the glass and shows the lacing that will steadily form throughout the drinking of this beer. Nose is yeasty, but hard to get much with the big foam head blocking the beer. When the head dies a bit, I got some cinnamon and spice hints along with the dominant yeast and malt. After 30 minutes the nose starts to blossom and smells like whole wheat pizza crust. The first sip tells me the beer is really ""full."" The beer has steady carbonation that makes it feel nice and the thickness of the beer coats. The taste is elaborate malts and yeast. Mildly sweet with citrus and estery notes as well as brown sugar, and nuts?. The beer is not sour, but sour enough to keep it from being ""sweet."" The flavors are complex, but restrained. It is not as ""flashy"" as some beers. It wants you to coax flavors and aroma out of it. The nose doesnt waft up and hit you while you are not paying attention; you have to get your nose into it to smell it. The flavor is the same way, it is restrained and ""it is what it is."" The beer is probably a good representation of the monks that created it, ""rich"", but you would never know it. The finish is initially sour then mellows out to a calming, complex, but understated finish.   RE-RATE  4/27/05 Bottle @ Hopleaf in a Westvleteren glass. Aroma is subtle. Spicy with bourbon? notes. The flavor is huge. Dark fruit, yeast, almost a caramelly flavor. The mouthfeel is absolutely amazing. The beer has the sweetness and flavor of a dubbel x2, hence the quad nomer? Raisins, plums, yum. Once again, it is very good, just too reserved. Very good beer. Scored the same.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Cap date 21/12/02 
This pours thick into the glass, producing an unusually large head considering the alcohol content of the beer. A few solids at the end of the pour. Slightly hazy reddish brown in color with a light mocha colored head.
Complex aroma, honey, brown sugar, dates, cherries all melded in malty madness.
The flavor follows the aromas, sweet and chewy with some alcohol that didnt fade as it warmed. I would probably drink more of the 8 if both were comparatively priced and easily available as the 8 hides its alcohol a touch better and still delivers that same flavor that the 12 provides. Both the Westvleteren 8 and 12 are my kind of Belgians and I must learn how to brew something like this.  A very tasty brew that is worth seeking out.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"

The nose was very fruity, with lots of sweet fig tones, and an almost appley, crisp aroma. There is a nice spiceyness as it warms as well. The flavor is awesome. Very mellow, wtih a spiceyness and an alcohol burst that play very well together. The flavor moves into the fig, and slightly bready notes, but also with a touch bitter on the finish.

As it warms, the alcohol really comes out, esp. on the finish. This is a very, very good beer by anyones standards. But, it is not perfect.

Aroma of brown sugar, caramel, dried fruit and vineous alcohol, along with cinnamon and a hint of banana. Sweet and full bodied flavour with brown sugar and dried fruit, vineous and slightly hot alcohol. Grassy hops, and a quite bitter finish


Original excited 2004 rating for 4.8: A cloudy to muddy dark red/ruby brown beer with very little head. What can I add about the aroma, that wasnt already said here? I picked up earth and plums at first and then so many other impressions that I couldnt pick them apart, but just sat and enjoyed. 
The flavour is quite sweet and malty, but balanced and very long lasting (the beer lasted an hour, the flavour lasted another hour). There is a lot of hops to balance, and a licorice dark malt note too that adds a dry finish. Round, pleasant mouthfeel with just noticable bubbles and an almost oily whisky like mouthfeel. Its just a wonderful drink and at risk of being Ratebeer conformist, Ill have to say that it earns the 20 overall score second to only Kaggen.","Odense, DENMARK","Christian"

I had to sit down when I smelled this beer.  Bananas, Apples, Candy, Malt, and Hops and Caramel are all very present.  The taste is spectacular, but just a bit too sweet.  The caramel, banana and wine taste are quite unique.  Just awesome. 
Re-rate: I was not quite as impressed this time.  This particular bottle was a bit one dimensional and I am not sure why.  It was still great, but I am beginning to think that there is a lack of consistency in this beer. Still a world class beer though.

Pours out a nice deep brown color with a decent sized white head. The aroma is amazing, with complex fruits and sweet spice. The taste is almost godly. There is such complexity I have no idea how they pull it off. It has a nice bananna flavor with other more subtle notes of spice, fruits and brown sugar, with slight yeast and a tiny little note of hops.

2852,"2004-10-11",4.6,"Poured reddish brown with a medium off-white head that left a lacing on the glass and film on the beer.  The smell is strong and enticing:  fruity red wine, with some spiciness.  I hypothesize that opening a bottle and leaving it in an unventilated room would have the same effect as putting up an air freshener or burning a scented candle.  The taste is extraordinarily complex and well-layered.  It starts off sweet with obvious fruit overtones.  In the mouth it gives way partially to some spiciness and a mild roasted flavor.  After swallowing it leaves a sticky sweet taste in the mouth that repeats on you long after youve finished it.  The alcohol warms the throat, but is exceptionally well-hidden in the taste of the beer.  Very smooth, amazingly drinkable, and undeniably enjoyable.  I will keep my other two bottles in my cellar a while longer to see what aging does to this fine brew.  Overall, I felt this beer lived up to the hype and then some.","Brookfield, Connecticut, USA","IMtheOptimator"

Very woody in flavor.  Soft on the palate with a good bit of malts, alcohol and more fruit.  Seems slightly off to me but I cant explain why.  Seems, dare I say, like a little plastic in there.  Still excellent flavor but not quite as complex as the aroma.  Alcohol kind of dominates the palate and may be killing some of the flavor.  Finish is warming and a little sweet.

Heavily aromatic, complex, winey nose of cherries, plums, currants, caramel and toffee.

Complex, melded flavor. Up front, the beer is lacking in my opinion but does possess notes of cherries and grapes. Mid-palate leans into a brandy-like sweetness, notes of caramel and pepper and finishes with hints of plums and berries. The alcohol is precisely hidden throughout the brew and it simply just doesnt show its potency. That being said, I truly dont find this beer to be all that flavorful and I never have.

A dry fruity caramel, whisky barrel flavored sweet coffee, vinous prunes, spices, banana. A bit of yeasties in the glass... hard to pick it out in the aroma/flavor though. Maybe its the slight dryness. Sticky mouthfeel... fizzy by the looks, but not so much in the feel (which is good). Warming in the belly... to be enjoyed slowly. Mmm.....

The bottle is dated ""11.06.06"" - was very carefull not to confuse 6 with 8, as 8 lacks a solid vertical line on the left side like the 6.  This beer pours (in Westvleteren glass) a dark, dark brown-red liquid with a generous one inch thick light caramel colored beige head that dissipates slowly, so slowly leaving a nice sized layer on top.  Aroma is of port wine, figs, grapes, plum, faint-pleasant alcohol, berries, dates, malt, yeast.  My mouth waters, but I cant tell if it is because of the aroma or simply the anticipation.  Flavor is of port wine, figs, all those things and more!!  I was expecting quite a bit from this beer - and it delivers.

Malty and lightly herbal aroma.  Much the same for flavor.  This run seems to be between my previous ratings, and closer to the first.  None of the typical yeast or herbal/spice character.  No hops, no nuts... sigh.  7/4/7/4/15 (3.7)

Re-Rate Jan 13, 2006: Many thanks to JK for sharing the holy grail.  Now my original rating was pretty down on this beer and though my opinion has gone up, I still do not think it is the ""end all be all"".  Still the same murky brown color with a thin tan head.  Aroma is outstanding.  A complex blend of herbs, spices and dark fruits.  The taste is great, yet subdued.  Velvety grape, sweet malt and Noble hops.  Very fine, but to compare with Rochefort 10, much of the taste is the same yet much more subtle.  While subtle can be a good thing, in this case, I think it robs the beer of true greatness.  8/4/7/4/17 (4.0)

Original rating Sept. 20, 2004: Pours a dark amber color with no head.  Looks beautiful, like a scotch or brandy!  Aroma is... a little bland.  Just a few hints of barley for the upcomming joy.  Oh well, first sip! ...  What?  Where the hell is the flavor?  This has mild hits of barley and malt with a bit of spice and bread, but barely recognizeable!  Dont get me wrong, this is a decent brew.  The best in the world?  Are you kidding me?  The monks who are bottling this bland beer and eventually peddling it to me at $8 a bottle are laughing all the way to the bank.  What a joke. 7/4/6/3/13 (3.3).","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"

This has been my holy grail of beers for over a year now. High expectations abound. Pours a deep red/brown color with no signs of co2 other than a nice large tan head. The head diminishes relatively quickly and leaves a nice creamy layer. Lace clings to the glass. The aroma is rich and earthy; malt and dried fruits, plums and spices. Hints of bubblegum and candy sugar. Flavor has a sweet start with quick effervescent spreading (rolling) of a dry metallic hop bite. Mouthfeel is full bodied, creamy and surprisingly effervescent.

Its a great trappist, just like most the other trappist - i could go on about the body, finish, aroma etc. but its all been said before. Its way overrated though - great beer, but not my favorite.","DENMARK","Hojou"
2852,"2004-08-08",4.2,"I finally found the westy 12, after searching for quite a while, where was it? a damn coffee shop! Anyway, quite an amazing brew, although not my all time favorite, still quite enjoyable. Dark red/brown color with a nice ivory head. Malty aroma with some nice spices, a bit of a wine like quality, and some wood smells to it. Taste was rich, complex, and malty with a strong sweetness like caramel. Some mild bitterness toward the end gave it a bit of balance and the overall smoothness of this brew was very impressive.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
2852,"2004-08-04",4.4,"This is not my style of beer and, for some perverse reason,  I wanted to dislike it, to be able to denigrate the icon of the beer world.  Aint gonna happen.  This was awesome.  When Andy (Landseer) presented me with the bottle, the absence of a label told me what was in store.  The coveted Westvleteren Abt 12.  It took me months just to learn how to pronounce the damned thing.  And here it was.  The beer that many consider the best on the planet.  And it would mark my 700th rating.  Poured out a hazy burgundy with a foamy, whipped cream-like beige head.  The nose was complex.  There was hints of berries, plums, spice, citrus, oak cask.  What else?  Who knows.  Something different for everyone.  It was smooth and creamy in the mouth.  Full and rich.  The warm feeling of alcohol as it went down.  That esophageal warmth.  Elixir.  The flavor was equally complex.  Vinous.  Spice and fruit and sweetness and candy and bread.  Each sip brought new discoveries.  As the last sip went down, the only thought was, ""Damn, I want more of this.""  And so now the quest to procure more.  For this opportunity, my thanks again to Andy.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
2852,"2004-08-02",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 9, 2005 Very dark and cloudy. Large, thick and light tan colored head. The aromas of peaches and alcohol were the first out of the bottle. Then, I detected notes of bitter-sweet chocolate and raisin bread. When you first take a drink, it is warm, spicy, fruity and sweet all at the same time. The flavors change with each drink as other world class beers that I have tried. Notes of apples and ginger are balanced with bread and a spicy, peppery finish. The alcohol is very well hidden. The aftertaste is also interesting with a little bubblegum and overripe banana. The aftertaste is strangely sour. I think that this detracts a little from an otherwise excellent brew. I would like to try a more aged example. I have had a more aged example and was not as impressed. Fruits and spicing are still detected, but the beer had also lost some body and life. Just the slightest hint of oxidation. I followed this with excellent St. Bernardus 12 this time, the Westy is still the superior beer.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

Should we expect it to be the best beer we have ever tasted?  Should we be over-critical expecting an experience to beat any other, thus meaning any imperfections will lower our markings?  I have tried to be fair to the beer in my points and my comments, but it is difficult.
The aroma is malty, fruity and cakey.  The appearance is a lovely dark nutty brown with a thick long-lasting tan coloured head and great lacing (Served in an Orval glass).  The taste is yeasty, thick, chewy alcoholic and very warming, and the aftertaste is very long-lasting.  I enjoyed the experience drinking what is obviously an excellent beer but didnt get any outstanding characteristics which are present in Rochefort 10.  Im not going to say the beer is overrated as that would be a criticism of my fellow raters, but I think Im fair in saying that for me the beer was only deserving of just over an overall 4.

When jercraigs invited a few of us over for tasting session, I figured that I would hit #500 that day, so I decided to bring this along to share the love. The question was: would this world-renowned beer reach our expectations? Colour is rich mahogany with a slight cloudiness and a prefect beige head. Aroma is full and appetizing with notes of sugar, raisins, molasses, cinnamon, plum pudding and gingerbread. Warm, full mouthfeel. The flavour is less complex than expected, but still remarkable in its balance and uniqueness, holding sweet fruity malts, worldly spices, and some hints of dark rye bread. In the end, it wasnt the brain-expanding experience that we were half-expecting, but it is still a world class beer, and easily in my personal top ten.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"

Sweet flavour, booze soaked dark fruit flavours are similar but more complex than in teh 8, and much more so than I remembered from previously samples of the 12. Sweet malt, muted caramel lingering boozy fruit. Aroma is alcohol, mild notes of the sweet sugary malt to come in the flavour.

The beer poured dirty brown with orange highlights and a thick, dissipating to medium, light tan head.  Nice aroma of bread, bread, more bread, prune, raisin, and alcohol, with a very perfumey, candylike feel.  Flavor let me down a bit, perhaps because it was minimally fruity.  Bread was predominant, with toasty and phenolic character, some prune (but not too much), and spice.  The alcohol burn was a bit too strong in the older bottle, while it was balanced better in the younger bottle.  Still, the alcohol did detract from the experience on the whole.  Its solid, but I prefer its sibling, Westy 8.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"

The resulting experience was worth the wait.  this beer poors a deep mahogany color toped by a nice and large light brown head.  The complexity of the beer first makes it presence known in the aroma with a malty and fruity nose present.  the tasting experience reveals a  cornucopia of flavors.  So many wonderful flavors are present that it is hard to single out any specific flavor for evaluation.  What a complex and wonderful beer.  I did get significant flavors of dried fruit (raisin, dates, plums etc) with some yeast (dough) present as well.  Nicely balanced as the moderately sweet initial taste is offset somewhat by an appropriate amount of hops.  Alcohol is definately present and adds a nice warming effect.

This simple little dark brown bottle, naked as a jay bird with no lable poured a very attractive clear mahogony brew (be careful however because if you get the yeast in the bottom itll change the opacity).  It had a light brown frothy head, like the foam on a good capaccino.  The smell blossoms as it warms like a bouquet of flowers opening in the morning sun (I know, cheesy metaphor, but this beer is the stuff poetry is made of).  The aroma had hints of caramel, roasted malt, perfume and herbs in the hops, a dough like yeast, and the darker fruits of plum, prunes and raisins.  Every taste bud was pleasurably engaged by the complex array of flavors.  A sweet caramel, roasted soy sauce, resin hops, richness of the darker fruits in the aroma, doughy yeast in every sip.  The Greeks would use this beer as the perfect example of the ""golden mean""  for it is very well balanced so no one flavor or smell was overwhelming.  There was a warming (yet not offensive) presence of alcohol in the smell, taste and palate.  This palate was just awsome.

Finally, I am able to taste this gem that Ive heard so much about.  What a wonderful sensation.  Such a smooth beer,  and there is a wonderful nuttiness to this beer coupled with some nicely roasted malt flavors.  All of this mixes with the strong fruit and chocolate mentioned with the aroma.  The beer finishes great as well.  The nutty taste is the last to leave the palate proceeded by an alcohol presence and the previous flavors mentioned.  I have to thank my buddy Mike who called me from World of Beer in Tampa and said ""Hey, Im at this huge beer store, do you want me to see if they have anything for you?""

Gingerbread, pastry, more fruitiness (dates, figs, plums) and big sweet dark malt flavours - caramel, toffee, chocolate with alcohol peering through the fog. Strong, dry, gently roasty finish.

Now, knowing what I know, having tasted what Ive tasted, never again will I have an Abbot Quadrupel, or any creamy dark beer for that matter, without subconsciously comparing it to ""Westy"" Westvleteren 12, and being slightly disappointed.  One gains, one loses, however; and having lost that beer drinking innocence, I have gained the appreciation of this fine specimen.  Malty and faintly acidic in the nose, it had a foamy, creamy and huge lightest-of-browns head with beautiful lacing and an amber red color in the bulb of the glass.  The taste was malty, chocolate milk at first, completely filling my mouth with flavor; the hops in the finish start very faint and somehow grow in intensity like the sun emerging over the horizon to attain a smooth, smoky quality, which fades into the twilight of a fond memory.  Its almost dry at the very end, and some of the citrus I smelled comes forward.  There is noticable alcohol, but its a big beer, so thats understandable.

Rating #500
 Pours with the darkest of crimson. The head is a substantially thick; a fluffy kaki cap with lacing that is plentiful, yet fine enough to adorn  Princesses wedding gown. 
 The aroma is far more fruity and less chocolaty than the Rochefort 10. Dark notes of plums, raisins, figs, prunes, apricots, sweet red apples, a note of banana. Wow, what a robust fruity complexity! 
The coco must have been hiding in the flavor, because thats where I found it! I totally pull out monstrous notes of Figs, Dates, and Prunes, a touch of that tart-ness that is mostly found in the prunes. There is a great depth of sinister malty complexity here. Toffees, caramels, and bakers chocolates to eternity! There is a great nutty complexity.. wooded cinders, a hint of smoke, and earthy notes of peat! The yeast brings a depth of pumpernickel.. this is very Remarkable! 

 The palate is lush and velvety near perfection I suppose.. Ill probably never actually know perfection; even if it were in front of my face. There is some spice in the finish, black peppercorn, with  undertones of clove Damn Westy 12 is very much praiseworthy of its high marks!","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"

After my fourth tasting in a year, I must downgrade this legendary beer. The consistency just isnt there.  Every time the rich cholocate is there.  Otherwise, the aroma goes from cobwebs to fresh brewed coffee depending on the bottle.
Surely handling has something to do with this inconsistency.  This inconsistency could be attributed to the volume of its complexity, with a new element shining through each time...I just dont really believe that.  Still a great beer...just not the best.

To celebrate my 33rd bithday, what else could I request...A 33cl bottle of Westy for my 133rd rating, of course!  Best By 25-Nov-05 (18 months old).  Id like to give all the alluring details, but this one was a *slight* dissapointment.  The aroma and appearance are second to none.  The flavor is not.  While all the complexities are present, roasted chocolate dominates, making this less than ideal for me.  The mouthfeel included noticable alcohol burn, without being creamy.  All of this seems to paint a grim picture, but really these are just gripes that make me belive this beer is a *tad* underwhelming compared to its reputation (and price).","Marietta, Georgia, USA","skaughty"
2852,"2004-05-14",4.8,"Bottle: Poured a deep ruby colored beer with a huge thick foamy dark white head with incredible retention (the head was still in place when drinking the last sip of this beer 30 minutes after the bottle had been opened). Carbonation is really good with lots of bubble at the bottom of the glass and some other ones sticking on the side of the glass. Aroma is comprised of light and sweet roastiness with a nice touch of spice but I could not detect any alcohol. Taste is an almost perfect mix between caramel malts, candi sugar and something else, which might be cinnamon. I was really glad that I could not taste the alcohol since it could have been quite harsh at 10.2%. Wow, what a beer. I originally thought that this might be a bit of an over hyped beer but Im glad to report that it lives up to all the praises.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
2852,"2004-05-12",4.3,"This was a total surprise rating.  I helped my professor bottle a batch of his homebrew and afterwards as were standing around talking he opens this and pours it round.  Zowie!  I actually have a bit of allergies left, so my nose is not as good as it should be.  Nevertheless, it smells like honeyed sweet-dough biscuits and cream, like raisins and apples and passion fruits, grapes and apricots.  Also alcohol.  The fruity smells were most apparent, I was hard pressed to get any non-ester malt smells.  Looks supremely confident of itself in its shimmering dark brown translucency.  Taste is like a sticky bun full of cinnamon, rum, apricots, dates.  Sweet muffin dough malts and just a little bit of yeastiness.  Finish is chewy and long.  This is way more complex than I was up for tonight, but I DO intend to try it again (har, har) and will probably adjust my description.  Only detriment was an apparent alcohol taste, but at least it wasnt harsh...it was warm and soothing, but it still tasted like ethanol.","Pennsylvania, USA","Probiere"

2852,"2004-05-08",5.0,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2015 Rerate 1/12/2007.  More complex than I remember it.  This bottle had an ""05"" on the cap; Im not sure if that is the ""best by"" date or not but if this was old, it has aged very well.  The alcohol is completely hidden.  The aroma is full with plums, oranges, sweet white wine.  Flavor is outstanding as well.  Lots of sweet malt, and more fruit.  There is a vinous quality, some yeast, wheat, fermenting fruits, apple.  Cloudy brown appearance, not much of a head and low carbonation.    When the bottle is held up to the light, I can see the sediment.  When in the glass it is too dark and murky to see any sediment.  Thick and heavy palate.  I had this bottle so long I almost didnt want to drink it, but Im happy a few other people had the opportunity to try it. -------- beer is too complex to do the rating justice from my first bottle.
Aromas of malt, coffee, tea, and flowers.  Dark brown, a huge white head, and brown sediment.  Flavors of coffee, malt, and an herbal taste.  Full bodied, but less so than I expected.  Very smooth and easy to drink; the high abv is not noticeable in the taste.

2852,"2004-05-02",4.5,"Now is the time. This is number 666, and what better beer than this to be rated on the devils number? I have had Duvel, as well as Lucifer. Old Nick doesnt make much of an appearance in these parts and so I am left to deal with this one. Why? Read most of the reviews and you will see that this is described as heavenly, as angels crying on the tongue, as a beer made in heaven, as a religious experience made holy by the dedicated men of the cloth who produce this unctuous brew. So I pour this into two small Chimay glasses, as this should rarely be a beer that is savoured on ones own. In fact my colleague in taste was one who is unique amongst the Ratebeer community. My 18 year old son, of legal age in these latitudes was the willing fellow supplicant in the search for the beer nirvana. Aware of the beers standing he treated it with reverence in a way that belies his youthful years. And so it came to pass. Said I, let us exorcise the demons so often worshipped when the meter ticks over to beer 666. Two pours were taken, the first without the sediment so that the rich and bright body of the beer could be noted. A deep and lustrous copper hue with creamy head presented itself. And then it was left to settle. For a respectful period of time. From the nose came a potpourri of flavours, plums, grapes and subtle hop aromas. The initial flavour to greet the tastembuds was the intense frutiness from the nose combined with an equally intense breadiness and clear alcoholic mouthfeel. To state it is warming is an understatment but to also state it is the most amazing beer ever is, regrettably, an overstatement. Hell, its great alright, but it just doesnt put my head into a 360 degree spin either. The devil is cast out, but there could be a chance of his return.

Deep, and heady, rich, full of fruit, grapes, raisins, plums, and spices, a very complex blend, soft, but sensual, deliriously so, and delicious, and the more I breathe it in, the more the flavors become pronounced, more is revealed here, pepper, anise, rich mollasses, rum, sweetness compounded by rich dark flavors...
Now to drink...I...um...serious contemplation is required, for I am seriously, honestly, taken aback by the force of, not only the alcoholic content, but the strong, full, bewitching flavor of this incredible ale! It staggers the senses!

No, I was actually intimidated. Not that I don't feel I know my beers, but when you stray from the overall opinion, not to mention the highly touted raters, you risk being ostracized. Been there, done that. At least I can say with conviction that I did indeed enjoy this. Rather incredible in so many aspects as has been noted in page after page of notes. But be it the lack of refinement of my pallet or ever continuing sinus problems, I did not get the awe inspiring complexity. What I did get is what had eluded me in other references, that being what ""tobacco"" means in flavor. I damn near felt that a Cohiba or even better Cuban cigar had been sent my way in liquid form. Throughout it became almost TOO much. At least it is extremely pleasant as there were the other flavors and sweetness of malt, etc. And I was sad as he glass neared being empty. Always a sign of a great beer when I stare at bottle and glass with sad puppy eyes whining so that some will reappear as I invert the bottle to let minuscule drops come ever slower so that I can pretend to be savoring the experience just a tad longer.

The beer is a dark auburn ale, with a good white head, a complex aroma from the head. The flavours start off powerfully malty balanced by Belgian hops(old, for preservative value) filling the palate with an explosion of flavour being followed by the lucious winey 'old beer' flavours lingering at the end.

The head was thin and a tan colour. Left a good lacing on the glass that was slightly slimey and stuff. The nose is sweet yeasty and malty, slight hints of fruit, maybe some cherry but I couldnt exactally pull it out. The taste was initially sweet and warm, followed my yeast slightly and some cream.

One recommendation, make sure you add some of the yeast, it gives the flavour an added dimension.  A deep chestnut brown brew with a very enticing aroma of liquorice, hops, rich maltiness and a very complex fruitiness thats hard to describe (for me!).  The flavour, for me at least, is the perfect mix of strength, poise, and elegance.  Full and malty yet not cloying.  Hoppy and bitter yet not astringent.  Fruity and complex yet not overpowering.  I could go on.  The alcohol is just about noticeable, but it hides it well like most Belgian beers, and the strong bitterness in the long finish balances the malty palate perfectly.

2852,"2004-03-26",4.6,"The Westy 12 pours a tawny brown and has some dirty brown sediment drippings towards the end of the pour. Settles super opaque as a rosey dark brown color with a finger high crown of dark ivory creamyness, fading evenly and slow to a hazey broken skim and a firm collar hugs the edge of the glass a good portion through the session. Lace quickly slips back in with minimal spots sticking.

Aroma is soft and yeilding, complexing and layered; at it sits a welcoming orangey fruit yeast tone releases over some really nice cookie sugars and waffer light chocolate. Deeper wiffs bring out some darker fruits within of raisin and fig with and soft dry woodish earthyness. Slight phenolic notes emerge here and there as it warms giving it a bit of spice and burn. There's more here then I can really put my nose too. Cocoa filled fruits and light spices is what I can figure. It's very appealing however way you smell it.

Taste has a refined roundness with an encompassing natural tasting softness of fruits, earth, yeast, spice, cocoa, and some slight roastyness. Its quite soft for what seems to be such a big beer. The flavors carry alot of the effects over from the aroma, lending a bit more dark fruits then the smell would lead you to believe is there and they're there in good stature. There's some artfully placed sweet malts throughout that bring out the darker fruits and sweetness bringing in raisin, fig, apple, and touches of banana, oh but there's a bit more that continues to ensue. There's delicately hidden melding of chocolate cookie sugars, bits of yeasty spices, and mild caramel. There's a milding woody earthyness that keeps a small drying presense throughout as well. Again, there's more here then a can put my mouth too and intermingles with the body and feel of the beer. Quite complex and full of softly spoken actions. Very enthusiatic and engrossing to say the least.

Feel is beyond words here. Wow! Amazingly full, yet calmingly smooth and fluffy with a heavenly fine carbonation that continues to give way to the flavors, never too sharp and never too distant. Well rounded, superbly soft, and exceptionally drinkable. Its nearly a meal! It doesn't seem to have 10.8% ABV, its masked very well. One isn't enough, not nearly enough. It's Loftly, noble, sublime, and wonderfully put together.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

2852,"2004-03-06",4.5,"3/6/04.  Poured out of 330 mL bottle, obtained in trade with Evan Ochsner, 2/19/04.  Bottle expiration 11/06/06.  Pours a deep, dark, rich amber brown-- some red edges and even a hint of deep purple.  Great, dark cream head that lingers in a thin, dense-but-rocky whisp very long; very, very good lacing.  Looks stately and just excellent, but I expected a little darker brown, murkier body.  This one looks a little young.  Nose is rich and decadent-- cake, raisins, a hint of peppery heat, and a touch of vinous sourness and sharp vanilla pungency.  Subtle chocolate notes, but I think this is still too young for that malt depth to be fully charged.  First sip reveals what it's all about-- very full-bodied with dense, creamy texture.  Peppery yeastiness and alcohol heat cannot be ignored, but it's balanced against a backdrop of swirling dark dried fruit and cake flavors.  Feels absolutely divine in the mouth.  I do feel that the flavors haven't really come into their own yet, as everything is a little too sharp.  Finish is very elegant, even despite the apparent harshness of the beer in its relative youth, but is a little too peppery for me-- seems like the yeast.  Also a touch of burnt malt flavors way in the back of the finish.  Immediately warming in the throat and a little bit prickly.  Tremendously long-lasting finish with bits of brown sugar and cake lending some of the big impressions.   Mouth-watering and complex, it reveals new layers and just tickles, teases, and toys with your senses-- once you think you have it pegged, you find something new inside.  Truly very good, very unique stuff, but I feel that the bottle I had needs to sit awhile to grow into a top 5 beer.  The appearance and mouthfeel are already there, but sadly, it needs to round out its maltiness quite a bit.  Still, a damn treat whenever I can get it.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

2852,"2004-03-01",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 7, 2004  Disclaimer, it is the first time I have this beer along with 6 other comparables, 5 of which are classified as ABTs and there's only one among the 6 that I've had before. Only one was not taken blind (ommegang three philosophers). So basically, I've taken the 5 following beers blind in the same session: rochefort 10 (only one I had before), westvleteren 12, st-bernardus 12, weyerbacher quad, gulden draak. All 5 were taken in a Chimay chalice  A deep chocolate body with a fully diminishing off-white head, initially well-laced. Bottle-conditionned, with some beige sediments at the bottom. Aroma is a nice blend of vanilla and chocolate (black, brown and white), milkshakish, slightly vinous. It didn't grab me particularly, but seriously, let this warm and this becomes a tremendously complex malt offering. Full-bodied, creamy with a good carbonation. Taste is loaded with dark fruits: blackberries, plums, dates. It's a complex caramel cream with a chocolate syrup, no it's a cake, it's a pudding with a little alcohol bite. Very complex with a well-expressed yeastiness. Definitely the most complex of the ABTs. It's delicious for sure, but doesn't strike to me as the best beer in the world. It's the best balanced of the big dark ABT trappist styles to my liking, but it's not necessarily the most intense, although such a refined aftertaste is hard to match. Maybe I will rate it higher in a future tasting. It sure held the competition in a blind tasting, so I know this is pure world-class stuff, I'll have to get into deeper analysis eventually and will definitely enjoy doing so.

2852,"2004-01-30",4.8,"My 100th rating, on my birthday, with a Westy 12.  What a good day.  Apperance is a murky dark ruby brown with a fair tan head.  Aroma is sweet & malty with some nice hints of fruit, plum and pear, yet it's some what earthy with that nice Belgian yeasty smell. Flavor is just an awsome explosion of complex tastes. Fruity, phenolic flavors with a nice malt backbone and some excellent toffeeish things happening.  Finish is great as the start. Alcohol warmth with a fizzy yet slighlty dry feel.  Just fantastic, best Belgian by far.","Hawley, Pennsylvania, USA","tidiaguy"
2852,"2004-01-28",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 30, 2004 I've been waiting for this for a long time, and finally got some thanks to The_Beer_God.  I hope that the beer can live up to the hype and my anticipation of trying it.  For starters, I love the humble, unlabeled bottle.  Pours a deep ruby with a big rocky tan head.  Aroma is not overpowering but very interesting.  Yeast, pepper, wood, and raisins are there.  Flavor is incredibly smooth, with little carbonation.  The initial taste is peppery, then a sweetness comes on which finishes in a warm dryness in the back of the mouth.  There is a distinct bread/yeast character.  Wow, I just keep noticing more as I drink.  After it's done, a hoppy bite develops.  This is a very subtle and enjoyable beer.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","desurfer"

For me, that sums up this beer nicely.  There's no question it's well made and really very good, so my comments are primarily directed toward this beer being ""the best.""  It's very nice, but lacks some special quality to make it ""the best"" to me.  Anyway, a nice dark burgundy color with lots of visible sediment and a somewhat thin light tan head start this highly anticipated brew.  The nose is light with lots of rich fruits.  I could swear there's a hint of chocolate raspberry truffles, as well as other fruits.  The flavor of this beer is also quite nice!  More dark fruits abound and a nicely balanced hop bitterness that begins subtly and ends magnificently as the beer fades into a vineous alcohol warmth.  I can certainly see why so many believe this to be the best beer in the world, and it certainly ranks among my favorites, ESPECIALLY among Belgians, but it still seems there's something missing to match all the hype.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","WabashMan"

Looking forward to next trying an aged version. Cinnamon and light pepper quality.  If this is the model Unibroue et al use they need to keep working to catch up.

2852,"2003-12-30",5.0,"what can I say about this beer that hasn't been said before?  plenty:

my first beer of the evening, alone at home.  I'd been looking forward to this for weeks.  I'd been saving it for quite some time and I was finally going to have my bottle of westy 12.  I opened the bottle and poured the beer into a glass.  the lights dimmed, ""that's funny..."" I thought and went up to check the light switch - nothing wrong.  I heard a voice from behind me, it said ""we've been expecting you jesse, you're late.""  I turned around and floating above the glass was a loaf of dark bread, a box of raisins, a bar of bakers chocolate, toffee, plums and apples dancing around a tree.  ""what the hell?!?""  I said.  then the loaf of bread punched me in the face and knocked me out.

when I came to I was in my chair, but not at home.  I looked around me and saw I was flying through a hazy brown  tunnel.  ""what's going on?"" I said to myself.  a voice that sounded powerful, yet soft said ""...we are westy...we mean you no harm...we only wish to show you something...""  we started moving faster and I shut my eyes, we seemed to go on forever, then suddenly we stopped and I heard loud music.  I opened my eyes and saw myself, sitting with a friend in a bar.  I was younger(and thinner).  I wondered where I was.  I looked around and realized I had gone back in time.  it was 1997 and I was in montreal for the jazz festival.  we were at the peel pub, I remember they had $5 pitchers between 3-7pm and my friend and I were starting a bit of a piss up before the night began.  ""what on earth am I being shown here?""  I thought to myself, then I heard my friend say ""my uncle said we should try this beer...""  I looked at what we ordered and it was blanche de chambly.  I heard my self say ""wow.  beer can actually taste good.""  I smiled as the words echoed in my mind.  I stood there looking at myself having a revelation.  everything faded to hazy brown one more time.

I woke up in my chair in my living room with an empty chalice in my hand and a warm feeling in my stomach.  this beer reminded me of why I fell in love with belgian beer, my first love.  totally worth all the hype and compliments it gets.  thanks westy.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mrkimchee"
2852,"2003-12-29",4.2,"Complex beer. I was hoping this would blow me away but it didn't. Still a good brew though. I was impressed by the complexity of the aroma and flavor. Creamy, spicy, and fruity in both the aroma and the flavor. Medium bodied and finished off well. Not the best in my opinion, but still really good.","Newport Beach, California, USA","haddon90"

I was surprised that is had a very small light beigish head, but I'm guessing it was knocked down by the alcohol;  the body is a nice even coppery brown color.  Wow!  What a plethora of aromas to be taken in all at once. ""Do you know what a plethora is?""  Malty, bready, yeasty, apple juice, raisins, a light malt whiskey, hints of buttery oak and caramel.  Plums and raisiny malt flavor start things off, then caramel and dates!  It's very well balanced with a malty finish;  the aftertaste is malty smooth with a light roastiness.  A little woody flavor and light hop flavor makes their way into the finish as well, as well as a hint of vanilla.  I'm still waiting for the alcohol to show up!  Very smooth mouthfeel, so smooth it's only lightly warming and has a full body with low carbonation.  Also probably another reason for no head.  Merry Christmas to me!!!!!  Again, thank you Slikwily for this phenomenal beer!  I think someone forgot to tell those monks to put alcohol in this because it is barely noticeable making this a very dangerously drinkable beer.

It is a very drinkable beer.","Silver Spring, Maryland, USA","jeffin7"
2852,"2003-12-21",3.9,"Oh, it was good.   Not the best I've had though.  Taste is a sweet assault of raisin/date/fig and other stuff, very complex.  Aftertaste is, oddly enough, kind of bitter.

Body is full, smooth and delicate on the tongue. Possibly the most smooth ale I've experienced. The flavor of this beer is also one to savor and combined with the aroma is one that's hard to beat. That's one thing about this ale I found most impressive. The in your face aroma with the flavor is an onslought of your senses. The malty caramel and fruit flavor leads to a gentle warming sensation towards the middle of the glass. I'm glad I finally had a chance to sample this wonder, but at a price of $13 a bottle it's one I won't enjoy often.

At first, she wasn't too impressed as the lager was too cold for the complex flavors to blossom.  I stole the glass from her unsuspecting hands and told her to wait - all her desires would be fulfilled in time.  Minutes passed, the sweet expectations driven by the site of the beads of sweat slowly dripping down the glass.  The lager warmed and she took another sip.  Her eyes widened.  Her mouth opened and words tumbled from her quivering lips.

2852,"2003-11-28",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 25, 2008 (2005 bottle sampled 12/2008) Aroma of raisins and dried plums, anise, saltiness. Salty-anisey flavor, lots of dried fruit, quite intense, sweetish maltiness, slight sourness, orange-peel and anise in the finish. Medium body, no alcohol presence.
(Bottled, BBE 09/2007, sampled Dec 27, 2005) Smooth, syrupy aroma of raisins and plums, plus anise hints. No alcohol. Very malty, syrupy, smooth-anisey flavor with soft, warming alcohol hints. Some sticky-sugary bitterness. Quite full-bodied, silky-smooth-carbonated palate. Already considerably better than the fresh (06/2008) bottle I compared this with. Will probably get much closer to 5 by more cellaring...
(Bottled, BBE 09/2007, sampled Dec 19, 2004, was 8-4-9-5-18=4.4) Dark reddish brown color with a medium, beige head. Slightly roasted, malty and alcoholic aroma with licorice and some coffee hints. Sweetish, malty and wineous flavor with some salty soy-sauce, fruit, anise and other herbs. Quite full-bodied, smooth and slightly alcoholic, very warming palate with a somewhat high, but balanced carbonation. A very nicely balanced, complex, but a bit alcoholic brew. A few years of maturing would probably do good for this one.
[Old re-rate Feb 4, 2004, was 3.7 before this] Dark drown color, no head. Wineous, a bit alcoholic cocoa aroma. Very full-bodied, wineous, peppery flavor with plenty of herbs (anise). Heavy stuff! Needs to mature more to soften the flavor, but very good anyway.","Helsinki, FINLAND","sayravai"

The alcohol is warming and as you get further down the glass you'll be finding yet another facet of this many splendored nectar. Variety of fruits and tastes to be discovered, among the dried fruits some chocolate. I'll need to rate this again to do it properly, but I'm hardly overrating it now!","Falun, SWEDEN","Kalli"

Ruby brown clear (until last pour) with small lacing off-white head. The best mouthfeel of any beer Ive had. Liquid velvet. Sweet & complex to start. Can taste most of the odors described above. Alcohol, too. Finish stays sweet but some mild hops introduce themselves for delicate bitterness that persists to the aftertaste. Leaves with nutty dry sweet-bitter.

I have spent a great deal of time ""tying one on"" achieving my goal and I would like to start my ratings today with the ratebeer king of beers.  Opening the westvleteren 12 was a treat.  Not an overpowering aroma as I anticipated however there was a strong smell of dates/raisins to me and a strong alcohol aroma.  The appearance was dark cloudy brown, with a thick light brown head that never died.  The taste is quite complex.  I taste the dried fruit and molassas. It is extremely silky on the tastebuds and has an outstanding burst of complex flavors.  It almost leaves you guessing.  I like that.  Outstanding on the palate, in a class of its own.  I can see how this beer is rated as one of the top dogs in the world.  As I finish the bottle, it gets even more enjoyable.  The only drawback is that the bottle ends to quickly to make a final analysis.  I look forward to purchasing another bottle and doing a rerate.","San Diego, California, USA","rogueman"

2852,"2003-11-01",4.9,"It is with much trepidation that I approach the throne of Westy 12.  Upon opening the bottle a lovely fruity aroma is released.  Nice head of varying sizes of bubbles.  The color is a deep red.  When held up to a light, it is a beautiful red glow with hints of yellow.  The aroma is of ripe fruits (pears, berries, apples, bannanas) and yeasty as well.  Now for the first sip.  Some vinous qualities in the finish, which are surprisingly pleasant.  Hoppy bitterness upfront with thick rich malts in the middle.  Bready yeastiness as well.  Plum flavor.  Notes of coffee and chocolate(!) as well.  I can see why some people say this beer is inconsistent, as every sip seems to taste a little bit different.  I think that what makes this beer is the malts.  They are so rich, and the texture is so smooth.  The aftertaste is a constantly changing array of flavors that lingers for 10 seconds.  I am very disappointed that my glass is almost empty because every sip reveals an amazing new aspect.

Then as you swallow it turns tails and you get a big wallop of wood and yeasty goodness.

Huge, mountain-shaped head, almost solid, leaving a fantastic lace over a deep garnet, hazy body. Lively carbonation, with a perlage of tiny bubbles all around the glass. A joy for the eyes. Caramel, ripe fruit, raisinis, brandy and something yeasty in the aroma. The taste is full, rich and balanced; gets dry and nearly bitter (almonds?) in the finish. Very long and hoppy aftertaste.

2852,"2003-09-30",4.8,"Like the commercial description indicates;I remember the rumours years ago that you had to go to the monestary in the middle of the Belgian countryside,to get their ales and that Westy 12 was only available on certain days.You would go to a window and pick them up in a wooden crate.By the time I was hooked on Belgians I found that some specialised beer stores like Belgian shop and De Bier Konning would make that trip for us.Now it's great yet kind of sad that this Holy grail of beers is so easy to obtain.Anyway back to the beer.Complex sweet sour orange spice,chocolate bread aroma with no alcohol.Dark chestnut appearance with perfect head and small white particles.Thick sweet fruity orange bitter spice, dark fruit flavor.Only a little old fashion bread flavor towards the finish combined with apricots.Lingering fruity aftertaste with very slight hops and no alcohol burn.Strange that the last time I tried this I remember it seemed more like a dark bread bomb.Succulent.","San Francisco, California, USA","mixamatt"

Nose and taste of dark malt, espresso, and floral hoppiness, with a huge finish.  Does a good job of hiding the taste of its high alcohol content.  Hard to find any fault with it at all.

Old rating, november 11, 2005:
Dark amber, nice brownish head. Now, this is a complex beer... Aroma brings alot, but the nutty  and malty touches came thorugh the most. Some dark chocolate, vinous, spice and peppery. Some hops, you name it, it was there.
Flavor is dry nutty and malty, spicy and peppery hoppy and from dark chocolate, even more nuts and malts. Some syrup and a pleasant finish. Incredibly complex and a very. very good beer. Oj, vad den var god...","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rlgk"
2852,"2003-09-21",4.8,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2005 My original glass was enjoyed on one of the most picture perfect days I can remember (4th July 2002): sunny, 70 degrees (F), nice breeze and I was sitting on the patio at the brew pub across the street from St. Sixtus. . . I remember the amazing fruity aromas and robust malt well.  I recently sampled another bottle and though the setting was as great, the flavours were just as amazing. . . the aroma has loads of different fruits: ripe pears, bananas, watermelon, and kiwi, as well as freshly cracked nuts, almonds, pecans and deep, full malt.  The body has light brown edges that get steadily darker and more red in the middle.  What little alcohol is present in the nose is also folded into the complex flavours and velvety palate.  Smooth chocolate, strawberries, toasted and buttered sourdough, this is truly a first rate beer!

11.2 oz bottle [22.05.05 on the cap, sampled 4th July 2005]: cloudy beechnut with a modest taupe cream that diminishes significantly, but never fully leavesThe palate is actually softer and smoother than I remember, I didnt think it could possibly get better!  The flavours a bit dark and more developed than the fresh sample: the alcohol has penetrated each ounce and helped spill more of the nuttiness and fruitiness throughout.  I have heard that it is best at 3 years, and after this experience I would tend to agree.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
2852,"2003-09-18",4.7,"Every drink of this brew brought with it new flavors.  From nuts to berries to spices, it never ran out.  The color seemed odd but that was most likely due to the lighting in the room.  I was sad to make it to the bottom of the glass.","Boise, Idaho, USA","bsour"

2852,"2003-09-09",4.9,"UPDATED: JUN 29, 2006 Well, I finally bought the true ""King"" of beers. 11.2 oz slender, tapered brown bottle. No freshness date seen, but none needed either. Poured out a dark, murky brown color, with hints of ruby around the edges. Had an enormous white head at first, but slid back to a yeasty island on top of the beer. When I poured this beer & got near the bottom of the bottle, I noticed big, brown chunks of yeast coming out, so I eased off on the pour. Aromas right off the bat are of brandy soaked raisins, plums, and other dried fruit. No hop aromas at all. All dried fruit, spices, and sweet caramel malts.
The aromas are very complex & change over time as the beer warms up. Tastes kind of strong at first, then the malts soothe the tongue from the bite of the spicy alcohol. Very malty, very well made beer overall. Finished with a warming effect, and a slight coating of the tongue. I truly wish I could afford more of this nectar.","","Cobra"

Alcohol is almost not apparent in the flavor, which is very balanced.  There is the first initial hop taste, then a very complex mouth feel.  There is a a bittersweet quality to this one for me however: I finally got to drink it, but I was supposed to drink it with my brother, who is now en route to China...","Lakewood, Ohio, USA","MAP"

Westy looked quiet decent with its creamy white head. Aroma -it reminded me of the bark from centuries old pine trees that grow south of Krotoszyn. Not a surprise to anyone that malt (roasted no to darkly) used was also one the best. Slightly sweet, and alcoholic in finish. If you think that Zywiec Porter with its 9.5 % was drinkable what a surprise was to see 10 % brew to be event smoother. Very clean, well executed, made beer.

2852,"2003-08-16",4.8,"i'm sure many of you must KNOW what i've gone through: i've fretted, worried and mooned over my bottle for months now; she came in the mail from england, just after three p.m. on the fourteenth of february. little westy weighed in two pounds four onces-- with all the frilly packaging. people said she looks like me, but they're just being nice, oh, she's just beautiful.  we'd been, you know-- trying --for years to get one, but no luck; we were just about to give up when this miracle happened. given up for adoption, the silktork agency paid to have her sent to me--and i'll love her as if i brewed her myself!  when we heard she was coming i got busy and fixed up the spare shelf in the refrigerator: painted it bottle brown with cute silly little monks dancing around.  brought her home from the mailbox and everyone was over and we had cake and took video and everything, gosh, and then put her in her little coverlet, checked the temperture, made it all snug-wuggy and cozy, i kissed the diminutive palm-tree on her cap, and closed the door...  and waited. for what, i don't know.  weeks went by.  sometimes i'd go out and just check on her, and stroke that darling little label-less brown glass cylinder.  i'd heft it like i was going to drink it, haw-haw like a pirate, and then feel guilty--(why?! oh, WHY?!?)--and i'd put her back down, smooth the covers and feel bad and maybe just go drink a bass or something.  i just couldn't bring myself to sully this magnificent bounty by sucking it's lifeblood and sending it through my carnal, undeserving and corpulent body!  but the moon was full, i was writhing and wincing like a werewolf tonight under the spell of that hypnotic  bottle.  i crept out to the fridge, trembling with nearly erotic anticipation and experiencing frightful inner-conflict.  but this time the bottle wasn't dormant, but standing and radiant, and then she spoke her first words: ""do me, stud!""  hallelujah! my time is at hand! this wanton extravagance blesses a snifter with oak-barrel ochre hues, ruddy at the core.  head was the buffy tan of sparrow down, thick as a queen's mattress and with lace billowing downward in the most regal self-assured gothic lacing.  jewels of yeast within the pour are practically as collectable as moon rocks-- so celebrated is this beer.  as each swirl writes a chapter of lacy elfin script, the nose speaks it's own tongue: alcohol and vanilla, vienna roast coffee, with caramel cream, dijon mustard, and the honied perfume of aphrodite's hair, drying on the bee-buzzing summer lawns of nirvana. at fifty cents a sip, i decided to name each sip after great heros of the bible, alphabetically.  from abraham through adam and onto amos, i was already slave-like to the spell, the apple-strudel spiciness had made me dizzy, while the bitterness had sculpted my tongue like a yielding slab of marble under the loving and deliberate blows of michalangelo's hammer.  sweet malts of fruit finally dominate an otherwise perfect balance; alcohol too well hidden because it was over too quickly.  i considered breaking the bottle to lick the damp insides of each shard.    yes, call me a cork in the current of peer-pressure, yet i fully and willingly succumb to the hype of my mentors, and hereby write my own hyperbole onto the tablet of ratebeer tasting. i must concur that the drink is in intimate proximity to perfection-- at least as far as we mortals are allowed to know.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

Various images come pop up in my head while drinking this.  I need about 20oz. more to decipher what's going on here.  Very worldly and mysterious.

The taste, quite surprisingly, is nothing like the nose of the beer.  I noted faint cherries, and silky chocolates.

2852,"2003-06-03",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 28, 2005 OK, here goes my crack at the number one rated beer on ratebeer.com on June 3rd of 2003. I held a special party for this one. I invited 3 friends and Hotstuff to join me in a little Westy 12 sampling party. Two showed up and the third gets his sample tomorrow as well as 2 other co-workers. My Rating: This brew poured a medium head of fine to medium sized light brown bubbles and a cloudy yeasty semi opaque dark brown beautiful body. The aroma was its weakest point as it was only a sweet mild malt aroma. I would have expected a stronger more pleasant aroma for a higher rating. It has a very complex flavor of roasted notes as well as spices and the taste that a high alcohol content brings to a great brew. It had a tingly mouth feel in its finish as well as an alcohol taste. This is truly a brew to sip and enjoy as long as you can make it last because you certainly cant get too many of these especially at $10 a bottle. This brew has to rate as one of the best beers available. It is truly a masterpiece! The high point of the tasting came from a younger gentleman who had never had a great beer before. He rated it as the best beer he had ever had. Who would have guessed! The low point of the evening was when the host offered up a couple of more beers after the Westys. Sorry to say, he had Miller lights in the fridge! Gag! The friends rated the brew as 8-3-10-4-16 and 6-5-9-5-19 per the RateBeer rating system.

Okay, I was a total newbie in Trappist beers when I sampled the WV12 a little more than a year ago. What will be my impression of this so called wonder, at this point?
At first my nose senses pepper and apples. Next smell evolves plum or prune. Another sniff and there is plum or prune. Yet another smell, and I sense chocolate. Hehe....
Flavour: Aah...this is a big beer! Must sip it very slowly, in order to catch all the delicat flavours. It's more than full-bodied, has chocolatey undertones plus that feel of exotic fruits(mostly lemon), much more pronounced than in Maredsous 8, which happens to be my favourite Belgo this(!) far. The body is also a bit oily(like Nils Oscar Julöl 2003) and unbelievably pleasant to gargle around with in the palate. What a beer, the texture is amazing! From an intellectual(common sense) point of vies this beer is perfect. But when giving the points, there is always the personal liking that has to be considered. Therefore it's only a ""17"". I love it. But there are beers that I love better.
Old rating gave  7/4/8/3/15. 
Nut brown color. Creamy off-white head. Fruity aroma with notes of vinegar, clove, raisins, dried fruit to name what I can interpret. My friend who got a sip from it claimed that ""This tastes like shit!""...well, I can't agree but since I'm not a fan of Belgo beer my rating is indeed generous.

2852,"2003-05-10",5.0,"The beer gods have smiled down upon this brewery.  Absolutely the most satisfying beer that I have ever tasted.  It pours a dark and murky brown with hints of red and an impressively large head that dies down quickly.  The aroma reminded me of a barley wine with a lot of fruity scents and a hint of alcohol (I'm not a fan of Barley Wines, so I was hesitant). The flavor was incredibly complex.  The flavor is so incredibly smooth that I was in shock (considering the aroma)  I think I notice a hint of chocolate in the taste as well as some different fruits and a couple spices.  The mouthfeel of this beer is extremely smooth and satisfying.  I could drink this beer all night long - although I'd probably not last more than three because of the alcohol.  Again, this is THE best beer I've ever had and I would recommend it to anyone regardless of the $8 per bottle price.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","clvand0"
2852,"2003-05-09",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 4, 2006 Aroma is of pears, spices, and alcohol. Apperance is brown with a ruby tint. Flavor could best be summarized in a 12 page essay after no less than 20 different samplings, but considering the limited space I will do a brief summary....Chocolate covered raisins, darker fruit is present maybe plums or dates, caramel, and other things I cant pick apart very easily. Its like trying to pick out every single instrument in a symphony. It goes down smooth with an alcohol warming effect. This would be an excellent way to warm up on a cold night. Palate is spicy, fruit filled, and tingly. Im a hophead by nature but for this style of beer, by god, you cant and wont go wrong. Go to whatever means to obtain this beer!","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"

2852,"2003-05-08",4.0,"Fantastic head, lacing, and carbonation.  Try as I might though, I had a lot of floaties in my glass.  Ambrosial aroma.  I think maybe the most complex smelling beer I have had.  However, the mouthfeel was desperately lacking with almost no body and a thin, feeble texture.  The flavor was vacuous compared to the aroma and nothing like I was expecting from this distinguished beer that does not live up to it's hype.  Try a Unibroue 11 or Epluche-Culotte instead.","Lancaster, California, USA","Sven"

Bready sweet body has some dark fruit complexity and crisp dry balance. Hides its alcohol well.  A nice beer, but I still prefer the Westy 8 or Rochefort 10.    

5/6/2003: Pours a murky dark brown with a thin, lightly lacing head.  Musty wood and malt aroma with notes of alcohol.  Light chocolate flavor with some caramel and a moderately bitter finish.  Silky, effervescent body terminates with a soft alcoholic burn.  This is a good Belgain ale, but I was not as impressed with it as its rating shows.  I guess you come to expect a lot out of the highest rated beer on the site.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

Really beautiful in the Trois Pistoles glass, I was content to sit and watch the swirling head and rising bubbles for awhile. There was no rush or expediency for me to taste. Mind-boggling amount of various flavors that constantly changed as the brew warmed to room temperature. The perfect amount of spicy richness in both the aroma and flavor. One that can only be described accurately to one wbo's enjoyed it before.

2852,"2003-03-22",4.8,"So I finally got my hands on a bottle of Westy 12 thanks to mwsf.  I finally get to see/taste/smell what everyone is talking about.  Creamy, slightly beige head.  The head takes a while to settle down.  Fairly aromatic, I can smell it and the glass is a couple of feet from my nose.  Sweet aroma, yeasty with hints of raisons.  The color is dark, like the cloth of a monks robe.  Lots of carbonation, but not huge bubbles, they are pretty small.   When this beer hits your tongue, you know something special is in your mouth.  Yeasty taste, but not as much as some of the other Belgians and Belgian Strongs I've had.  Delicate on the tongue.  The carbonation doesn't ruin it.  The alcohol is hardly evident.  This beer is numero uno for a reason.  I'll buy this every time I get a chance from now on.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AustinMilbarge"
2852,"2003-03-21",5.0,"You wanted the best, you've got the best...well this was the introduction of a great rock n' roll band, but it's perfect for this beer. Brown colour, thin head, but really lasting. Incredibly creamy texture. Raisins, strawberries and raspberries in the aroma, with some vanilla hints. The flavour is delicate, complex, really pleasant, it's difficult to describe all the sensations that this beers gives in your mouth: fruity (raspberries, apricots, peach, strawbeery, raisin), sweet (caramel and vanilla) with a touch of sourness. The finish is balanced between sweet and bitter flavours, with good coffee notes, very persistent in your mouth. This beer is perfectly balanced and you can't even fell the high ABV percentage. Westvleteren 12 is simply the best beer I've ever drunk in my life. I'd have never thought to give a ""5 out of 5"" percentage, but this beer really deserves this rating.

2852,"2003-03-06",4.7,"I loved this beer.  White rockey head that dissipated slowly until it was firm lacing across the top of the dark copper body and up the sides of the glass.  The aroma was pleasantly restrained, it made me work to name things in it.  A slight woodiness sneaks out behind bushels of sweet malts.  Esters and alcohol compliment the sweet maltyness with aromas of plums and raisins.  The moment this beer hits the taste buds life gets so much easier to deal with.  Full flavors develop over long periods of time, right through the swallow and keep going until the next sip.  Rich maltyness with plums, raisins, a hint of wood and some well controlled alcohol will swim through your mouth as this silky smooth full bodied delight goes down.  The finish is not so much a finish as an intermission because the flavors keep going with a slight acidic note to clean the palate.  please may i have another?","San Diego, California, USA","akinm"

Lots of malt, raisin and yeast in the nose. Very bread like smell. There is also a slight smokiness with the bread.
Holy esters! There is so much going on in the flavor.   A big kick of malt and hops is a given. Plums and raisins mixed with a ton of alcohol. There is a single malt scotch undertone too. Maybe it's the wood note others have tasted. Or it's more likely the dark candi sugar (if there is any...). I'm need to cellar a few and see what changes.
Very dry finish that almost leaves a chalk-like feeling on the tongue. Nicely carbonated at cellar temp.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bender"
2852,"2003-03-04",4.6,"Wow....and i do mean that with a wow!!!! Definitely worthy of the best beer on ratebeer distinction. Upon admiring our bottles for about a minute or two myself and akinm decided it was time for the opening. It poured a reddish brown cloudy color with spots of ruby and extremely noticeable yeasty deposits. It maintained a wonderful pearly white head which danced marvelous around the glass and had moderate head retention. The aroma was ALL OVER THE PLACE and as it warmed led to SOOOOO much more. Raisins were quite evident, plums and cherries..specifically plums were right there upfront. A Deep malty sweetness..some very old oak aged wood was apparent. I also got hints of a citric apricot or peach, with the ever so slightest hint of alcohol, 10.8% is hard to hide. The taste is unbelievable...only the second beer ive ever tasted that got more complex the more i tasted it. Plums were right there..raisins coating the back of the tongue, sweet sweet vanilla and complex malts caressing the sides of the tongue, oak and slight spicing give it an aged feel, with medium carbonation in the mouth. Something of a bittersweet citric orangey apricot that adds a minor and i mean minor but PERFECTLY balanced citric aspect to counteract the vanilla sweetness. This beer definitely got more pungent in every respect as it warmed, just wonderful in every respect of the word. Aftertaste is fairly dry, like chewing on a vanilla covered orange peel, or apricot skin..just magnificent. World class beer for sure, and a nice choice for beer 250, 1/4 way to 1000!!!","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"

Probably the best smelling brew I've encountered.  The  head appearance of the first bottle differed from the second.  The first poured from the bottle a cloudy dark walnut with a large amount of fixed particles and had a fully lasting light tan frothy/fluffy head with mediocre lacing.  The second had an off-white fluffy head that diminished quickly.  The overwhelming flavor is deep and pungent with a sweet start, warm middle and a balanced peppery finish that speaks of anise.  Again quite a bit going on here.  The heavy body is full, lively and dry.

Very noticeable milk chocolate.  Don’t know how to describe this.  Soft and luscious.  Like sucking on the world’s best candy with the lovely candy sugars.  Fruitiness is quite subtle, softer fruits like apricots and pears.  Incredibly long finish, a sweet, tart, sugary, fruity ghost that haunts the tongue for several wondrous minutes.  Best word for the palate is just soft.  I don’t drink it as much as it somehow deems me worthy of placing it in my mouth and it gently works its way around my tongue and down my throat.  Is it strange to be repeatedly thanking the bottle for allowing me to be near it?  The Westy didn’t taste in any way overcarbonated, but it acted like it in the bottle.  After pouring out several ounces into a glass, I put the bottle down.  A good ten minutes later I noticed foam coming out the bottle, slowly wandering its way upward.  Just damn lovely, no bones about it.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
2852,"2003-01-07",5.0,"UPDATED: NOV 23, 2007 Time for a treat !!!! Well deserved after my hard, but successful, phoning job to obtain some two crates of heavenly fresh Westy 12. Yes, the time is indeed right to celebrate.
And.....what is more appropriate than tasting my cellar remainings: In this case: A one year old Westvleteren 12 ! Well, I need to empty my remaining wooden crates of Westy 12 ASAP to bring back to the monks, do  I.
Jesus Christ, what a beer !!!! The ester aromas that escape the bottle, just after uncapping, are just phenomenal ! Nearly a miracle..... Flowery, banana, prunes, fruity, in one word: ""wow..........""
Amazing creamy foam. First being fullbodied, and later falling into a thin creamy layer, including some resistant carbonation bubbles. The layer stayed there till the end of my victory celebration. An excellent quality observation.
This Trappist beer has aged with alot of complexity results. The flowery perfumes, in combination with some subtile Port flavours, makes the beer tasting like an angel pissing on the top of your tongue. This is a TREAT guys !!!!
This brown nectar is very soft too, and amazingly creamy. Tasting gives an immediate strong hop (Poperinge) bitterness, but the candi sugar sweetness immediate balances this, to give something extremely delightful.
The alkohol is there, absolutely, and this just in the right measures....... 10.2 vol%. Taken with care !!!
Dont worry, you will definite get drunk after a couple, but dont worry, a hangover is un-existant !!!
The more I taste, the more tastes I define. The Westmalle yeast gives the beer something fresh and digestable. Also something soapy, hard to describe really.
After one year of ageing, I notice some huge sediment inside the bottle. Pouring gave those lumpy sediment particles. Yeast mixed with some protein floculations. No worry, this is not unhealthy. I drank(eat) everything till the ever last drop.....","BELGIUM","Trappistenbier"

I taste fruit flavors that are subdued, light flavors of raisin, banana, and plum. However, I do get a strange off flavor that tastes similar to plastic that I do not find favorable. The finish is good long and sweet, but does show some alcohol. This is the fourth time that I have sampled this beer and feel it does not live up to its hype.

Head is initially small, frothy/fizzy, light brown, fully diminishing.
Body is hazy medium to dark brown, bottle conditioned.

Aroma is moderately malty (caramel, milk chocolate, cookie), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with notes of raisin, date, orange peel, marshmallow, brown sugar, toffee, cinnamon.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter.

Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively/fizzy carbonation, moderately alcoholic.

The one Westy that Akkurat had truly FRESH bottles of (probably because short-sighted thrill-seekers only seek out the 12, even though the Blond might actually be the best of the lot), and frankly I dunno if Ive had a fresher bottle outside of the monastery cafe. This is no longer a style of beer I enjoy very much, but its still a very nice, very clean beer.  Boozy and very sweet, but balanced very well (surprisingly bitter for the style) in the finish to drink the whole bottle enjoyably. Rich dried dark fruits as expected in the nose, lots of raisin and date, and many layers beneath. Its hard to say what ""the best"" Trappist strong brown ale is, but its almost certainly this or Rochefort 10, although both are too fizzy, boozy, and sweet for my tastes.

Had it as vintage and had it fresh. My personal favourite is a 2 - 3 year old sample. Just when you look at it, youre in love. The colour is dark and brown with a huge foamy offwhite head. The aroma is fantastic. Ripe fruits, light liqourice, a bit of brown sugar, spice, a subtle sweetness. Flavour as well i out of this world. Smoth, balanced and pleasant. The ripe fruits (raisins and plums) is mingled with spices and the sugary notes. Has a slight touch of alcohol. The vintage samples is a bit more smooth than the fresh ones. Has a fantastic spicy warming end, that last forever. One of these in front of the fireplace with the one you love! Who could ask for more.","Søborg, DENMARK","madsberg"

Abundant spices and fruits (plums, grapes, port flavor) blend very well together.  My only problem with this beer is the floating sediment that is abundant.  The beer is a dark, cloudy and murky brew with chunks of yeast floating about.  Not a problem for me though.  The flavor is excellent.  The aroma also still has a very yeasty smell that is a little overpowering.","Garnet Valley, Pennsylvania, USA","ARMed"

2852,"2002-10-10",4.9,"I have had quite a few crates of this beer. The aroma and taste varies a bit with age. In the young ones you have an uncontrolled bitterness that shines through. With age it develops its taste: port wine, bread, old fruit, choclate, etc. Vintage bottles get a slight petroleum aroma/taste just like old Mosel wines. I think that older versions lose some sweetness. For young bottles, say up to 3-4 months I would probably not rate it more than 4.2. For the more matured it varies between this value up to religious expereience levels.","Mol, BELGIUM","Kåstå"

It  also has a very smooth and creamy mouthfeel.

It lacks a litle in color tone though. Overall it beats Rochefort 10 and anything else Ive tasted. If you havent already, then give this beer a try!","Charlottenlund, DENMARK","David"

Smelling the empty bottle, the diacetyls and acetyls come out. Continuously effervescing in the glass with flocculent yeast. It hides the high ABV content quite well -- until it lands you on your tail.  Woody, musty, dusty & aged tasting. Quick finish, and it tastes good off the moustache.

2852,"2002-09-04",4.3,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2009 I guess everything has already been said about this one. My humble opinion?The 12 is the best of the Westvleterens, in line with the 8 by flavour, but far more complex and substantially sweeter. A nice brew, but nevertheless imho not worthy of the title best beer in the world, but i guess scarcity has a lot to do with that title. However, ive never had a fairly aged sample yet, which might considerably enhance the flavour.","Bussum, NETHERLANDS","jerohen"
2852,"2002-09-03",4.3,"Definitely a beer for the nose. Out of the bottle, Im hit with the same cereal grainy, sweet corn aroma of the Westy 8. As the nice, sudsy head diminishes (remaining significant), the aroma opens up quite a bit, becoming perfumy, with a grape juice/young wine/ fruit punch/sangria -like quality. Not as cheap as it sounds, this is the fruitiest smelling, non-fruit beer Ive ever smelled, but it is robust and woody, rather than cloying and sweet. The taste of the beer is very sweet and smooth, with serious, but gentle carbonation. Sediment is very present and the beer is a cloudy brown color with a reddish cast.

The taste is out of this world.. complex yet unified.. tastes like brandy, plummish and rummy, sort of like raisins,  with an acidic, dryish finish. As it warms, chocolate and caramel become evident.

2852,"2002-08-26",4.5,"As I am rating this beer, sitting in front of my computer I have a bottle of it that I am drinking, obtained online from belgianshop.  The use-by date on the cap is 23.04.05 and Im thinking Ill age my other bottles to see how they develop over time.  Fantastic, perfect, sweet malty aroma.  Color is a nice medium amber and the head has a nice nutty color to it as well.  Flavor has a nice malt-hops balance with a little more to the hops side, and yet it seems as though the monks used almost mathematical precision to obtain this balance.  Hidden within the balance one could imagine almost an infinite variety of flavor undertones, and this is a very neat effect.  For this reason, I imagine that after aging, it will be quite incredible.  Fine carbonation adds a nice tickle to the tongue, but slightly less than in the 8 (which I preferred a bit over the 12).  At room temperature the flavor of alcohol is more present.  This is an incredibly great ale, however, I do think that it is developing a somewhat legendary status due to the fact that it is made by trappist monks and it is pretty rare.  It is really great stuff and Im glad I bought it but I think I will still be satisfied drinking my favorite american microbrews most of the time instead, and for a lot less cash.  If youre really into belgian trappists though, this is definitely the one for you.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","FastEddie"
2852,"2002-08-21",4.6,"As the number one beer, I had to see if it lived up to its name. I was not let down.

But this is the best belgian ive had yet. Figs are everywhere in this beer. In the aroma and the taste and finish. The taste begins like port, which port disgusts me, but it was soon replaced with figs and coffee, possibly some roasted flavors. But figs describes it best. Goes great with chocolate. As a rule Belgians go great with dessert. Not a beer to indulge excessively in. Also...the alcohol was hidden in a totally perfected execution of craftmanship. Worth 12 bucks a bottle?

2852,"2002-08-14",4.9,"12/8/02: Rated 6 Westy 12s ranging from 6 weeks to 6 years of bottling age - notes too detailed to summarize here. Hope to submit article to RB soon. Ratings range from 4.5 - 5/5. 

Rerate 7/25/02: Rated during dinner at a small Belgian canal lock-side cafe while having a meeting of our local beer club. I ended up having this beer by accident along with a desert of Belgian chocolate and vanilla icecream smothered in a rum and raisin and advocar topping. I have never thought of a Westy 12 as a desert beer but it went togther with this desert incredibly well. The rich festive complexity of the the Westy just cut through and complemented the sweetness of the icecream and topping like a hand going into silk glove. 
Yes its still deep murky red brown with fine bubbled medium size and lasting light beige head and makes a really delicate lace. Aromas are like all your Christmases at once - I could sniff this stuff for hours to try and work out whats there. I get dried concentrated fruits like apricot and raisins, sharper fruits like apples and green grapes, aromatic sugars like  karri honey and chocolate, port wine, spices and a light fruit yeast, and virtually no alcohol.  The big yeast aroma and flavour in this beer is somehow special in that it doesnt overpower everything like it does on some of the other stong Belgians. 
This is probably because there is so much variety and complexity of flavours that generally match the aromas in this beer. Really smooth, creamy and filling on the mouth/tongue. A slightly softer sweeter middle and a bigger bitter finish followed by a longer mellow bitter sweet chocolatey aftertaste. Still the best aftertaste of any beer Ive rated.

small head but never blew off the top.  The aroma is predominantly of
dark fruits and alcohol but builds to a stinging spicy fire in the nose
if you keep drawing it in. Wonderful.  A medium to full creamy smooth
body that tingles the palate with its spirits.  Everything about this

Initially it was strongly raisin, but then warmed to suggest plums, grape, and caramel like a toffee-coated apple.  I thought the alcohol was hidden rather well, considering, although it cant be ignored.  Not much head on mine.  Inside of bottle cap was strangly molded; oh well, I havent died yet.  I wouldnt say the flavor is quite as engaging as the aroma--very nice, to be sure, but a qualitatively different experience, sweet and malty.

I also had a Konigshoeven Quadrupel tonight, so I had a comparison (thats a 3.8 beer).  This is a great beer but still not the top of my tree.  The palate is very nicely frothy, exploding in the mouth.  The sugars are controlled and balanced by hops.

The top end toffee and molasses profile stands out from the get go.  Carmelization of the malt sugars carries in the nose like roasting a marshmallow on the campfire.

2852,"2002-06-19",4.6,"One of the best beers of my life. Although I originally had this at the little cafe across from the Abbey, I most recently tried this beer two weeks ago in a bar in Brussels. The bartender treated it as a religous thing, honoring me by letting me have a beer, not letting me pay for it (said he would not put it on the menu) and told me that people were not supposed to sell it by decree by the monks. I do love this beer, although I have had bottles from 3 different times and one of them the beer was horrible. I have been told it is best to age it three years, (by this bartender) and I have to admit this bottle was better then I remember from the abbey. It still has just a hint of an alchoholic aftertaste so I can not give it a 5 on palate. However, I would reccommend getting this if you have the chance.

2852,"2002-06-18",4.6,"Prelude: A pair of Westys, gifted to us by the inestimable PsychProf, a fine summer evening, our balcony, and Carolyns wonderful eggplant pasta in our bellies.  Could it be any better?

Appearance: Well, murky has been used by a bunch of you guys, but it might not go far enough.  This brew is loaded with heavy sedimant, to the point that it resembles a pond brimming with organic organisms - this thing looks ALIVE.  One thing I will say is that the delicate white bubbles holding the edges of the glass last through the entire drinking experience - the thing might look like a swamp creature, but the gentle effervescence lets you know its a quality brew.

Aroma: Ive already raved myself into nonsense about one aroma - Old Horizontals - this one is similar - a pungency that draws you into inhale after inhale.  Depth. Power. Grace.  Warm honeyed and gingered biscuits steaming on a plate ...

Flavor:  This is a radical adventure.  I swear that I got something different on every sip - the  chronicle begins with spices and nuts, moves definitely into big red grapes, hits bitter chocolate and maple sugar, and moves finally into breadier flavors as you hit more of the sediment at the bottom.  

Palate:  Seems much smoother and fresher than the 8 and despite the sweetness of the taste, never gets syrupy.

Overall: Is this the best beer in the world?  Well, it definitely is the best Belgian Ive ever had, one that is able to excite my sensibilities like the balrywines, old ales, imperial stouts that I tend to like better than belgians.  A brilliantly done beer to be sure.","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"

I recall the 2001 bottling being much better, but I may have been a callow taster then, unfit to criticize such a highly rated ale. This bottle has some fruitiness in the nose, with some grains, with a mild sourness. The body is fairly thin, with a sweet and sour grainy flavor. It lacks the rich chocolate and notable spice that the earlier bottling featured (although that may have been my imagination, given the super high rating on this site). It is, in fact, rather watery with a distinct alcohol note, with light amounts of chocolate; hardly inspiring. The earlier five bottles from this vintage were similarly unimpressive. I dont really even want to finish this, but it was very expensive so Ill try.

I am surprised by the thinness of the 1st few sips- this was one of the categories in which it did not get a full mark from me. Baileys? I appreciate the alcohol coming through at the 1/2 mark: a beer like this should show its strength at some point and it it shines through nicely. The licorice is mercifully gone. The bottle was for sure too small.

2852,"2002-02-26",4.8,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2013 Fresh, yeasty, fruity nose. Soft and smooth texture, like liquid mercury. Stong and warming. Spicy. A huge ball of flavor sat in the back of my throat. Very well-balanced and very intense. Wonderful beer. RERATE: On a recent trip to Belgium (Jan. 2013) I looked forward to revisiting this beer -- to see if it stood up to the hype. My conclusion: While it may not be the very best beer I have ever tasted, its definitely toward the top. Theres something about it ... it has amazing depth and complexity, but it doesnt smack you in the face with boldness. Its like a bunch of moderately bold flavors and aromas all hitting your olfactories at the same time, and they refuse to fade. Notes: Frothy, rocky, tightly packed, lasting head with sticky, intricate lace. Rich, vibrant, complex nose (tobacco, toast, roast). Myriad flavors -- vanilla, wood, brown sugar, fresh bread, banana, bubblegum, ... and on and on. Complex and full flavored, yet it has true finesse. Makes my tongue sing.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
2852,"2002-02-24",5.0,"My favorite beer of all time.  Extremely difficult to find outside of Belgium.  The first time I tasted it, I understood why the monks call it The Bread of Life.  Could easily sustain a person while fasting for whatever period of time, plus with the alcohol content, youd sleep through most anything!  This beer represents, in my opinion, what a Trappist strong ale should be.  High alcohol content is masked by an incredible malt taste with just the right amount of hopping to balance the sweetness.  A rare find, which makes the price tag worth it.","Delaware, USA","DeadTerry99"
2852,"2002-02-21",5.0,"I finally enjoyed one... What an intersting beer;  to many smells to recognize; sensory overload in a good way! Molasses, maple syrup and spice at first, then minty, then fruity.  Every sip tasted  and smelled different,  the head lasted forever as i savored this beer over about 30 minutes, letting it warm up to about 60 degrees before finishing it.  The alcohol is nicely hidden.  Not too heavy and as clear as a dark amber could be. This has to be the most intersting and peculiar beer Ive ever tried.  Its going to be tough saving my other bottle for too long...","dalton, Massachusetts, USA","garv"

2852,"2002-02-10",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2013 I am not an experienced beer drinker by any means. The good beers I have had have been limited to the imports I find at my local grocery store, mainly the Spaten Optimator and Franziskaner HefeWeisse. I read through most of the reviews here, and decided I had to try this beer. I looked in the yellow pages under beer and found only one store. Lucky for me it was close and carried ""the beer"". $11 is a lot for a beer, I dont know if any beer can be worth that much money, so perhaps that is its only drawback(although considering it lowers the demand, its a plus). The casheir warned me that this beer had a very alcoholic taste and suggested I try the Rochefort (10). Thus he planted a seed of doubt in my mind, but that did not deter me. I cant add to whats already been said here, only confirm it. I brought the Bottle home (from Beer Shack for those of you in Tampa) and read some of the reviews here(again) to prepare myself for the experience. Then w/o delay I poured it, still not knowing what to expect! It poured with a surprisingly light and abundant head, definitely not like any other head Ive seen. I took a sniff, to read these reviews is one thing to experience it is something else! Its wonderful! To complex to describe here. Ill stop at this point because anything I would say has already been said!","Tampa, Florida, USA","ethanol"

Give some to the one you love this Valentines day. And also, Im a bald-headed non smoker. Sure I cant pronounce it, but If the beer store has it, bring it on! Also, Im guessing that the name is in Waloon, the official language of Belgium. And I have had this stuff IN BELGIUM! So back off Snugglemittens!","Toledo, Ohio, USA","LuckeyHaskins99"

2852,"2002-01-21",4.3,"Much more refined than the 8 IMHO.  Many of the same flavors (plus many more), but they blend together much better in this brew.  Very smooth chocolate, malt, yeast, fruits, hops and other things throughout the very full flavor profile.  Alcohol is totally hidden.  Just a touch of sourness and some hop astringency in the finish.  Beautiful deep copper to brown color with an amazing off-white head.  So complex Ill have to drink it again to fully understand everything going on in here. Well worth the effort it takes to find this.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"

The carmel and chocolate notes are quite abundant, but no flavor overtakes the other.  At 10.8% you do not even notice any powerful alcohol aroma or flavor.  This is just the finest smoothest you will find.  P.S. if you see this, dont buy it, (It will leave more for me)","Southampton, Pennsylvania, USA","amx1970390"

Amazing aroma...grainy, nutty and fruity..like a nutrigran bar and reminicent of a berry flavored wine. Palate is too much for me to describe but i will give it a shot. Chewy maltiness, toasted grains, plums, berries, nuts, bitter chocolate, pear,sugary sweetness, yeast, bread and others things that I catch and I know the taste but it comes and goes soo quickly, its difficult to discern, almost like having the answer at the tip of your tounge but not quite able to retrieve it. Awesome body, semi bubbly and lively mouthfeel, very lush. The smoothness,class and depth of character this beer posesses is uncanny.  Alcohol is almost unnoticeable except it shows itself in the dry/sweet finish. (I feel the alcohol is far more noticeable in Rochefort 10)  Superb balance and brewing. A must try and definitley top of the line and well deserving of top rated beer of this sight.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"
