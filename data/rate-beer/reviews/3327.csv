Promises less mineral as expected, more sweet honey yoghurt and peach jam buttered bread in aroma, adding dry sweet bread malts, some fresh Hallertau hop herbals (some pollen). Nuances of hazelnut on 2nd tasting SO. Overall a bit too well-mannered and lieblich compared to its neighbours down the street, if subtle.","Belchium im Biersgau, GERMANY","bartlebier"
3327,"2014-09-06",4.2,"October 2009: Draft at Schoilmichl in Nuehaus, Tag der Kommunbrauer. Hazed golden body, rocky white head.
Zesty and effevescent. Peppery, sweet, honey malt, wheat, hay, dried hop cones. Bitter, juicy, carbonic. (3.4)

November 2012: Draft at Zum Waldhauser in Neustadt i.d. Waldnaab, as Waldhauser Zoigl. Hazy golden orange with a billowy head.
Aroma is juicy orange and lemon Noble hops. Juicy, slighly musty, quite rustic. Quenching acidity, satisfying sweetness, sulfuric-lemon focused with a savory dash of darker malt. Hoppy and bitter and quenching. (4.2)

August 2014: Draft at Schoilmichl in Nuehaus.
Sulfur, lemon, cheese rind, faint game-y skin sweat notes. Carbonic and sharp, minerallic and crunchy. Sweet pastry bread honey malt with bitter noble hops. Strongest mineral character of any Zoiglbier in my experience. (4.2)","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
3327,"2013-11-11",4.2,"Draught at the brewery during zoigltag in 2009 and again in 2011 at Zum Waldhauser in Neustadt (the latter being positively supreme to the 2009 batch): Dark yellow. Lathery eggshell froth holds beautifully. Sherbety aroma with plastery yeast, honeysuckle, lemon cake, piecrust, orange marmalade, peach cobbler. Creamy, soft and lush carbonation. Opens with a spicy, woody hop firmness yet with plenty of nectar to bring softness and depth to the sophisticated hoppiness. Hops continue in their richness as a dainty mint-leaf coarseness provides lovely contrast to the finespun nectars. Fleshy marmalade textures exude from the pronounced fruity esters which augment the core with considerable heft and succulence. Gracefully weightless malt embraces the tongue with its palate-nestling dextrinous grip and cookielike edge, yet retains its silky softness as well. Very delicate malt is accentuated by shades of citrus marmalade-kissed toasted bread. Flavor is densely lined with sweetish nectar-laden vibrancy. Finishes perfectly attenuated, dryly malty and dusty with notes of hay dust and a well-polished medley of ripe peach and fresh flowers. Those among us who appreciate delicateness and serious refinement will drool all over this. An exceptional zoiglbier, all around, and one I could quaff by the liter. No soured fruit characters or huskiness to be found, clean yeastiness (zero doughiness), and impeccable malt extraction which makes for a luxurious texture. Outstanding.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

This golden beer of high pils malt contents feels sharply grainy, crisp and quite well disposed in terms of maltiness, but this exuberance did not come without some considerable vegetal DMS tones.
