1234,"2017-05-28",3.7,"Bottle. Chocolate caramel malt and fresh hay aroma. Dark copper color with giant tan head. Moderately sweet chocolate caramel malt and moderately bitter, astringent green hay flavor. Good body. Decent, straight forward beer.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
1234,"2017-05-27",3.4,"Poured from Germanic brown liter bottle into pub glass, a clear reddish brown, no head. Malty, caramelly sticky-sweet, very spicy reminiscent of coriander, black pepper, clove and/or grains of paradise. Subtle noble hop balance with lots of residual sweetness in finish.Medium-heavy body, moderate carbonation, big mouthfeel. Described as a Belgian Dubbel with Zwickel lager yeast. Seemed more like a Unibroue Christmas brew than any kind of lager. Unusual, pretty tasty.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"
1234,"2017-05-15",3.9,"Draft at the Manchester brewpub. Dark, blackish-red. Interestingly light to drink despite a big, malty nose. Well rounded sugary malt base, but not obtuse. Good schtuff! (#6604, 5/15/2017)","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
1234,"2017-05-12",3.6,"500 ml bottle from phaleslu. Thanks! The beer is a clear amber with a beige head of foam. The aroma is doughy, spice, and grassy. Grainy and earthy taste. There is a nice spice, like maybe rye was involved. Big body and medium to high carbonation.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
1234,"2017-05-05",4.4,"Tap at Busters with commonshawn. As always this bar delivers an incredible beer list. Beautiful amber brown color with an off white head. Nose brings to mind Belgian dark fruits with a sugary lean. Taste is delicious. A sweetness coming through in the form of caramel and sugary, almost toffee. A solid representation of the style with a distinctive Belgian twist brought forth by the yeast. Drinkability is high despite an elevated ABV. Malty and, again, delicious. Hard to find a better doppelbock produced on American soil.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"
1234,"2017-05-05",4.4,"Tap at busters with commonmac. Light ruby brown with medium white head. Sugary nose. Taste is heavy yeast, some raisin. Really good. Full body, nice finish. Delicious .","Minnesota, USA","commonshawn"
1234,"2017-04-11",3.9,"Bottle from Sampler pack. Pours a deep reddish-Mahogany color with fair head. Aroma of dark fruit, caramel and nuttiness. Taste of dark fruit caramel, with spice in the background. Mild bitterness and a slightly sweet finish. Medium body, really smooth with no hint of the 9% ABV. Very enjoyable beer that goes down way too easy.","St. Charles, Missouri, USA","Bif"
1234,"2017-03-27",3.8,"16.9floz bottle purchased as part of UCBCs collaboration 8-pack for $17. Bottling date is present (sometimes they are not), 02.16.2017. Ive had this on draft once, and will look to have Ommegangs version too. The aroma is an alright combination of bubblegum and licorice. Dark-brown with red tints and a finger of beige head on the pour is how it appears. Well this is basically a cleaner version of Ommegangs Abbey Ale. Flavor melds well together consisting of toffee, licorice, and orange zest. A yummy beer that I cant classify. Its truly part Belgian and German inspired.","","balloonbuffoon"
1234,"2017-03-13",4.1,"Clear, deep mahogany-red pour with a tan head. The aroma has toasted caramel and nuts. It has a full body with smooth texture and average carbonation. The taste is sweet with a slightly roasted, alcohol warmth in the finish.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","Finhead"
1234,"2017-03-11",3.7,"Pint bottle that I got from a sampler pack. A bigger beige head falls steadily. The beer under is dark brown, clear, and has amber notes. An earthy and kind of funky nose. Dark fruit and cocoa. Flavor is toasty and roasty. Earthy and bitter. Wheat and yeast. Some cocoa and astringent notes. This is a rich beer with plenty of heavy sweetness. Dark fruit including raisin. Sharp bitterness is spicy. A hint of brett pops up unexpectedly. Chocolate syrup and heat. But I see the ABV and am surprised that it is so high. This is dangerously good.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
1234,"2017-03-11",3.8,"Pour is a dark brown with a large tan head. Aroma is a massive amount of brown sugar and plumbs. Flavor is some raw sugar, dark fruit, molasses and a bit of star anise. I kind of get some yeast esters that remind me of other Ommegang beers. This was a very flavorful dopplebock. Thick, sweet and lots of dark fruit.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
1234,"2017-03-11",3.9,"Pours a clear garnet/amber with a really full light orange/tan head. Aroma is maple syrup and orange zest. Taste is sweet caramel malt, buttered biscuits, and maple syrup. Mild hop bitterness at the close, but ABV remains hidden. Quite good.","OFallon, Illinois, USA","wxman"
1234,"2017-02-05",3.1,"Sample at Jack Browns. Caramel with fine head. Smells a little like sweet corn. Very sweet then a little sharply bitter.","Sandston, Virginia, USA","tia"
1234,"2017-01-04",4.0,"It pours deep clear bronze with a beige head. The aroma has nuttiness, raisins, caramel and lager smoothness. It has a ridiculously smooth and pretty light body with moderate semi sharp carbonation. The taste has the aroma notes along with licorice and spices. This drinks stupid easy for being 9%. Really good.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
1234,"2016-12-24",4.0,"Keg at Urban Chestnut Midtown, 12/17/16. Clear dark reddish brown, large creamy tan head, good retention. Aroma of raisin, caramel, earth. The taste is raisin, anise, caramel, plum. Medium bodied.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
