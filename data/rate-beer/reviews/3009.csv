3009,"2015-06-13",3.3,"Oh my, a Sake that isnt completely white as there is a small yellow tinge, how is this possible (joking.) Aroma of vanilla and almonds and the taste is the same with an alcoholic kick and the end. The nut flavor at the end balances this well. My favorite from this Sake brewer, but then again that is not saying much.

A bit different from most Sakes.","Fair Lawn, New Jersey, USA","KoRoBeNiKi"
3009,"2014-12-23",2.8,"Bottle. Clear extremely pale yellow color. Aroma has floral banana. Taste is fruity, light. Not bad.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
3009,"2013-08-17",1.6,"First sake. Poured from a cold bottle. Very clear liquid with a very subtle hint of yellow. Smells like fruit and plum. Slight grain flavor, plum and alcohol flavors. I dont have a base for rating, there for I will rate off of personal likes.","virginia beach, Virginia, USA","mike5326"
3009,"2013-08-16",1.8,"Pour is clear, still, and light yellow color. Warm rice aroma with alcohol. Flavor is slightly vegetal and warming alcohol.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","DrewFace"
3009,"2012-11-16",3.2,"Bottle.  Pours clear with a faint yellow tinge.  A bit of soft banana, warm rice.  Medium bodied, soft rice and a bit of isopropyl.  Warm and full of rice.   A touch of melon, a bit astringent.  Decent enough.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
3009,"2012-09-03",2.3,"Pours clear in color with just a touch of carbonation to it.  There is a strong anise aroma with some apple juice, vanilla, graham cracker, and butterscotch.  Its lightly fruity with some hints of green melon.  The flavor is quite off-putting to me.  Heavy butterscotch sweetness, alcohol, and melon.  Light vinegar on the finish.  Sort of a medicinal flavor all around.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3009,"2011-09-25",2.2,"Bottle 300 ml. A clear yellow colour with a no head. An aroma of melon and alcohol. The taste is light sweet. A medium body, oily texture, no carbonation and a long finish. Sorry but I do not really like Saké.","Uppsala, Sweden, SOUTH AFRICA","jolo"
3009,"2011-07-24",3.7,"180ml bottle - $6.00 at Kuroshio Sushi Bar and Grille in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours clear, pours still, baby.

Smell: Floral, rice-scented, boozy notes with some subtle sweet accents to it.

Taste: Sweetish upfront, with qualities of mashed flower petals and rice. Hint of sweet vanilla cupcakes. A drop of distilled fruitiness. Slightly boozy and warming, finishing out the same, with a slow fade out.

Mouthfeel: Light, cool, and easy on the tongue.

Overall: Not the best, certainly no, but fairly easy to drink.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
3009,"2011-07-20",2.1,"Colorless and smelled like watered down vodka. More specifically, musty like rain (in the best way possible). The taste was like rice vinegar with a slight gin taste that warmed the belly as it went down. Worth the price, just not that impressive of a sake at all.","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"
3009,"2010-03-30",2.2,"Bottle from BevMo in Pleasant Hill/Walnut Creek, CA. Pours clear with no carbonation. Pleasant melon type scent. Thick, medium body. A bit gluey. Flavor is clean. Fairly fresh. Something like melon is mostly what I get. Much more palatable than many.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
3009,"2009-10-18",2.9,"Bottle from Jungle Jim,s.

Served cold. Poured clear color with good legs. Light rice, melon and alcohol aroma. Light to medium body with a dry texture. Light green apple sweet flavor with a light sweet alcohol finish that was of short duration. 

Drinkable sake.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3009,"2009-06-15",2.7,"Somewhat soury rice aroma. Clear body still body. Thin body. Flavor leaning on the side of alcohol. Biggest thing this has going for it is that the filtering probably makes it a heck of a lot smoother than it would be if it wasnt.","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"
3009,"2009-04-22",2.9,"180 ml bottle. My first sake..Pours like stained water. Aroma is of rubbing alcohol grain and some pine. Taste is somewhat medicinal. Kind of sweet with notes of vanilla and rice. Finishes a bit harsh with a slight sour to it. Mouthfeel has a definite alcohol bite. Different.",", Michigan, USA","coyotehunter"
3009,"2009-03-02",3.2,"180 mL bottle from Kroger Rio Hill Charlottesville, VA.Pours a clear very pale cream color and thin looking. Aroma of rice, vanilla and banana. Taste is sweeter than expected and very strong... melon, spice, banana and a vegetal quality. Medium bodied.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"
3009,"2009-02-11",3.1,"$2.99 Bottle. Room temp. Pours with a slight yellow tinge, but still very close to water like. A bit of legs, but they are on the weak side. Aroma is strong koji, steamed rice, light alcohol, butter, lightly vegital with a bit of unripe green banana. Taste is very clean to watery with a soft and smooth koji presence. A light alcohol tinge. A bit of dust. Not much depth. A bit bitter and sour on the finish. Very light mouthfeel, very watery.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

3009,"2007-12-08",3.7,"This is actually very nice.. doesnt have that bothersome kick that some cheaper sakes can have... is sweet and mild, with some fruit, rice, vanilla flavours... had chilled.... some slight yellow in the colour... for the price, this stuff is real nice... and id say, a very good sake for people to get there feet wet... nama-tastic...

3009,"2007-10-02",3.5,"The was the first time that I have ever had Sake and I liked it a lot.  I had it in the ""cold"" version.  Fair colour and no head (duh, lol).  I tasted a little bit of chocolate in it but thats probably because I taste it in everything","Carrollton, Georgia, USA","Codythegreat"
3009,"2007-07-09",2.5,"Bottle from Williamsburg Pottery.  Very pale yellowish greenish tinted pour with no head to speak of.  The aroma was ricey, white grapey, and somewhat plummy, with a bit of yeast noted.  Tasted like a somewhat diluted low level chardonnay, with the white grapey and plum flavors noted, but they seemed pretty muted.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

3009,"2006-06-15",3.5,". . . and I can hear the beer purists gripe as I rate this.  180mL bottle.  With my rating (if it stays on average), this will become the number 1 rated namasaké.  Since I have no ochoko, this babys getting poured in my New Glarus giant shot glass sample thing.  Just a bit colder than room temp, this pours a crystal clear.  Aroma of some rice (duh) and melon, very sweet scents, and alcohol. Flavor: I do get some plum, very sweet up front,  alcohol very apparent, rice coming through a lot more in the finish.  Dry finish.  Very light bodied.  I hope my palette in sakes gets better as it did (hopefully) with the more beer I drank.  Pretty good, just difficult to discern all the flavors and whatnot.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
3009,"2006-05-30",3.0,"Theres a drop of dull yellow in this otherwise clear brew.  From the alcohol driven fumes, I get a nose of grass, rice, and freshly cut crookneck squash.  Theres more alcohol in the flavor as well as the addition of melons and other light fruits.  Nice low alcohol burn in the finish.<font size=-4><a href=http://www.ratebeer.com/Places/ShowPlace.asp? and Cheese by TCC, Plainfield, IL<font size=-1>","Oak Forest, Illinois, USA","Cornfield"
3009,"2006-03-17",2.7,"Bottle  Ive had tons of sake over the years, but this is my first rating of said beverage.  Pours dull and champagne yellow, no pizazz whatsoever.  Aroma is sweet rice vinegar with plum.  Flavor is toned down rice vinegar with peach, a hint of plum, and a bit of chardonnay.  Palate is thick and slick.  I guess its okay.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"
3009,"2006-03-16",3.0,"miss-placed rating!!!  It was my first sake ever, i enjoyed it warm.  It had a good alcohol presence with a sweet mix of rice and cucumbers.  Taste was of warm alcohol and rice with hints of fruit and vegatable. all around really smooth.  
hope this is the first of many.","New York, USA","crazyvin"
3009,"2006-01-26",3.6,"Ive never really been a Sake lover but I think Im becoming one. I tried this cold and I have to say that it was the best Sake Ive tried so far. The aroma is sweet and grainy with notes of alcohol, almost like that of a high alcohol ""plum wine"". Very pale, clear yellow color is appealing and perfectly suited to such a light tasting beverage. Flavors of rice, alcohol, plum, and bamboo are all well rounded throughout the palate. Starts off sweet and finishes easy. Overall, I think Im going to have to buy a Sake set now. This is a world that I need to explore in greater depth. I would definitely buy and enjoy this Sake again!","Sarasota, Florida, USA","DKlovesbeer"
3009,"2006-01-07",3.7,"Bottle.  Intense nose - rice, soy sauce, pine, wood.   Yellow tinged water appearance.  Sugar sweetness hits you immediately and last throughout with grainy rice, light soy, pine and mild alcohol burn coming in later.  Woody flavor last long after swallowing.   A very enjoyable drink - like it more than I would have thought.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
3009,"2005-10-23",3.4,"180mL Bottle: Tinge of yellow beige. Ive found out that I dont have an eye for the lighter of the clear colors, Id never make it in the Diamond industry. The nose has a bit of rice husk and active koji with butter soaked squash. Some light dust and hay along with a lick of ethanol. The flavor is rather smooth, only a touch of alcohol burn. Impressive considering the source. A little left of neutral on the mouthfeel with a creamy full bodied finish. Chewy and buttery. A good american attempt at the Namasake style.","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3009,"2005-07-15",3.4,"Bottle: Clear with just a subtle hint of yellow when held to the right light.  The aroma seems a bit stronger than most sake Ive tried, but without any hints of or burn from the alcohol.  Its got a ripe rice scent with some hints of shoe leather and sweet apple blossoms.  This seems to get in your face a bit more up front in the taste than other sake.  Im having difficulty placing my finger on flavors but Im getting: bitter fermented rice, corn on the cobb (not in an adjuct sort of way), pepper-coated apple, and a taste similar to when you rip a fresh young branch of a maple tree and chew on that.  The alcohol comes through a bit more in the flavor, but never in a bad way.  Finishes dry and spicy, leaving your mouth tingling with a long aftertaste.  Good stuff.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"
3009,"2004-03-13",3.2,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2005 Bottle.  Opens with a sweet ciderish vinegar.  Like they used some flavorful rice.  Big tart flavor as well.  Finish is dry and quite full.  Much better than Ozeki, quite powerful and a very full aroma.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
3009,"2004-02-14",3.1,"This thing was only $1.99 - I can't say much (obviously) about subtleties of the aroma or appearance (except that it didn't smell 15%). It also didn't taste that strong, but it was far sweeter than the other couple of sakes I've had - and maybe even nutty...? I liked it.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
