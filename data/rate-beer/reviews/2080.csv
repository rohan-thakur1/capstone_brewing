2080,"2017-06-08",3.7,"LIBF2017. Kolor slomkowo pomarańczowy, mętny. Piana biała, tworzy się właściwie w chwili nalewania, by momentalnie stopnieć do nieznacznego pierścienia.
Aromat wyróżnia słodowość i nuty miodowe. Wydaje sie być kwaśny i wytrawny. Brakuje deklarowanych nut ziemistych.
Smak podobnie słodowo miodowy ale nie słodki. Dalej mamy tutaj delikatną owocowość i akcenty ziołowe.","POLAND","PlutonowyMan"
2080,"2017-06-06",3.0,"750 ml. bottle sampled @ LIBF 2017. Thank you for sharing RB-InBev Belgian crew! Golden, hazy citrus with no head. Nose is dull BE esters, soap, almost vegetable. Bland overaly soapy BE esters brew, almost vegetable, near green. Just soap, empty, bland, very empty. Far weaker than the other Scratch beers at the festival. I love mushrooms & Chanterelle is a tasty one but so far I feel like the do not work in beer. Did they use raw ones, raw mushrooms arent something that is very pleasant to eat, might be the issue here. Base beer is a very weak Belgian styled brew as well.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
2080,"2017-06-05",3.6,"Bottle sample @ LIBF17, thanks to the RB-InBev Belgian crew for the share.
Dorée versant sur léger orange, col léger blanc.
Arôme est finement malté avec une empreinte belge niveau de la levure, rétro-nasal offre des effluves terreuse et un houblonné noble.
Palais est assez doux, malt, signature rappelant une levure belge, champignon perce en retrait contribuant, je suppose, à cet effet un peu terreux. Petite douceur résiduelle sur une fin de malt pils, froment de saison. Effet funk reste plutôt subtile et au final, le caractère champignon ne contribue pas trop au développement de la bière de par son aspect un peu umami.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
2080,"2017-06-04",3.5,"Clear golden colour with quick fading head. Aroma and flavour are predominantly malty and sweet. Theres maybe a slight earthiness in the finish. I wouldnt call it as mushroom though.","Breda, NETHERLANDS","mike_77"
2080,"2017-02-26",3.8,"Shared at gregwilsonstl house. It poured a golden color with a white head. The aroma was of bready malts, fruits and earthy notes. The taste was similar to the aroma with more malts, fruits, earth and of course mushrooms. Different but really good.","Wentzville, Missouri, USA","jandd1983"
2080,"2017-02-25",3.9,"Orange. I would not have guessed this was mushroom. It works really well. Light. Buttery. Tasted at my ""names and numbers"" share. Thx Dave.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","gregwilsonstl"

2080,"2016-12-31",3.5,"From notes. Enjoyed at a tasting at Joshs house in Windsor on 12/19. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a decent darker orange color with a thin light tan head and a good lace as it falls. The aroma is really strange. There is a spiciness and a strong earthiness going on. Its like a sweet yam with a light tartness on the back end. Its a mess. The floral hop notes dont really go with it at all. The flavor is similar. Its a strange combination of earthy malts and light spice to go with the yam sweetness in there and nothing really balances. Its a little more composed than the nose, but its interesting. The mouth feel is a little light and decently carbonated with a strange earthy finish. Its something else, thats for sure.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
2080,"2016-10-30",3.8,"Pour at Shelton Brothers. Orange in color with some light notes and I got apricot over mushroom.","Lexington, Kentucky, USA","drfabulous"
2080,"2016-10-11",3.5,"GABF 2016. Light copper orange. Nose is some yeast esters and spice, bready malts. Taste is off dry, with malty dark bready notes. Good bier de garde, but beyond maybe some light earthiness, really dont get what mushrooms might bring unlike the black trumpet version.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"

2080,"2015-03-07",3.9,"Sampled at Scratch 2nd Anniversary - Pours golden orange with an off-white head. The aroma has a citrus bite, biere de garde cellar must notes, powder, floral notes, perfume and some mushroom notes. It is medium bodied with some mild sharp carbonation. The flavor starts with bright citrus / berries, then toasty malt, caramel and cellar must. The finish is mustier and has some spice, pleasing richness and a bit of mushroom meatiness. Really nice.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
2080,"2015-03-07",3.9,"Sampled at Scratch Anniversary. Bright honey gold. Beautiful textured flavor. Fruit but so much more. Rich malts. The chantrelle works so well here. I am not even sure what that is but I llike it here. Herbal notes. An interesting bitterness that is earthy and, well, woodsy. Really good.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
