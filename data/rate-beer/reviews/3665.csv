3665,"2017-05-16",4.2,"Caught somewhere between an old ale and an imperial stout, Special Reserve offers up a huge swath of toffee and malt, yet couples it with a black-as-night roastiness, deep veins of bakers chocolate and coffee offsetting the sweetness. Candied black cherries round out the middle, and the finish has a pine-floral bitterness that meshes well with the lingering java notes. No trace of the 9% ABV. Deep chocolate-toffee aroma is almost visible, and the oily black pour seems both foreboding and decadent. Delicious.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

Pitch black, pours slowly & thick (like old engine oil :D ). Tan head is small but holds.
Aroma alludes blackness - blackened crust, burnt nuts, roast coffee & bitter chocolate, touch of orange, earthy hop.
Thick, lingering, oily, somewhat dense texture. Makes no qualms about being a potent brew yet not particularly boozy, rather dry overall.
Rather sweet upfront - burnt sugar, molasses, dark chocolate, espresso, burnt nuts - sort of stout like without being acrid - some dried & citrus fruit character on a long bitter finish.

3665,"2016-03-10",3.9,"Pouring a deep coffee bean brown, the garnet highlights glint with the lights in the room angling just right through the glass. The head is thick and chocolaty, a soft foam a finger deep atop the rich liquid.
- As I bring the glass closer, the roasted malts tease my olfactory senses with a robust aroma of dark roast coffee, baking chocolate and leather, the combination growing more complex as the beer warms in the snifter.
- The glass tipped; a first sip. The flavor is ash and coffee with the first taste, and I let the cool brew flow over the tip of my tongue into the warm, tender places underneath it. There is a tantalizing burn on the inside of my lips, under my tongue; the alcohol apparent but not overwhelming. The body is heavy, but not nearly as viscous as I was expecting, considering the comment on the bottle. Thick it is, however, and quite creamy once I get my mind past that bit of burn that seems to impart a more lively texture.
- Allowing this to warm a bit in the glass, the flavor blossoms with dark chocolate cherries, and my lips become sticky with each quaff. The brew thickens with the warmth of the room and becomes more of what I had anticipated; the leather, ash, coffee and fruity chocolate coalescing to deliver a delicious and palette pleasing beer.

Little dark figgy plums, a bit porty, mocha, treacle; grassy and spicy drying bitterness kicks in pretty early - lifts the sweetness away but its a bit soon. A little astringent at the end. Smells very fine and there are lots of good things happening, but the flavours dont have the room to move that they do in normal Old Engine Oil and its a mite over-hopped for me.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
3665,"2014-09-10",4.3,"Pours pitch black with a slight head that laces and retains less than normal. Light nose of chocolate, roast and dark fruit (dates, figs, raisins) with a touch of coffee over a light rich malt sweetness. Medium bodied with a very slick, approaching creamy, texture. Below normal carbonation with no effervescence on the finish. The excellent flavor profile is quite complex yet balanced. Alcohol is noticed on the first sip, but then becomes well hidden. It begins with a rush of dark chocolate sweetness and roast over a light coffee background, then the dark fruit flavors predominate the middle. The finish is a slow fade of the flavor profile where the spicy hops become evident and leaves a nice alcohol burn at the back of the throat.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

Aromat: ciemne pieczywo, lukrecja, kawa, czekolada, likier kawowy, suszona śliwka, dojrzałe wiśnie, wiśnie w czekoladzie i likierze. alkohol bardzo dobrze ułożony, nie czuć nut bimbrowych a jedynie lekko słodki aromat od alkoholu przywodzący na myśl likier. Jak na takie ABV to bardzo dobrze.
Smak: w smaku nieco inaczej niż w aromacie, alkohol zdecydowanie wyczuwalny, potęgujący sporą ziołową goryczkę. Jest paloność ale już nie tak intensywna jak w aromacie. Są smaki tostowe i wiśniowe ale coałość nie tak fajnie ułożona, zdecydowanie bardziej płaskie i alkoholowe. Jak na porter to za bardzo chmielone i goryczkowe.

Nose shows a bit boozy light dark malt.. not nearly as ""black"" as I would expect.. 

Flavor is more dark.. but odd. Something that I associate with fermented out molasses.. background char that is sweetened a bit by dark raisin... some pronounced cocoa with warmth.. Palate dies off pretty quickly.

Nice sweet milky chocolate front, definite vanilla, big ovaltine character, slight caramel. Very subtle roast flavours, not at all overpowering. Just a touch of booze on a dry earthy finish. This is lovely.","SCOTLAND","dantheman278"

3665,"2012-04-19",4.0,"Damn, actually quite good for a brewery Im not that familiar with, and judging by the number of ratings, not many in the ratebeer community are either.  Had their standard ""Old Engine Old"" and was quite pleased with it (3.9).  Sort of your standard imperial stout, but with a noticeable spicy hop presence that works well with a considerable roast of malt and coffee.  High ABV well hidden!  Glad I picked this one up for a not cheap $5 / 11.2 oz bottle.","San Diego, California, USA","matthewjk"
3665,"2012-04-09",4.7,"Aroma has notes of chocolate, roast coffee and caramel. It pours a deep sable with a thick tan head. Scrumptious flavor has chocolate, quality coffee and malt notes plus hints of licorice and caramel. Lip smacking! Thick, smooth mouthfeel has a good amount of fizz and leaves a smoky, slightly sweet finish. You dont have to be an engineer to appreciate this one.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
3665,"2012-04-07",4.3,"bottle.  velvety black with a small brown head.  char, tobacco, raisin, milk chocolate.  flavors has light smokey notes, and milk chocolate sweetness, and some dark fruity/tobacco notes around the corner.  blends bitter/ashy with sweet chocolate.  medium full body and smooth palate.  drinks really nice for 9%.  i like this even better than the original, which was also fantastic.","","SSSteve"
3665,"2012-04-06",3.5,"4/6/12. 11.2oz bottle. Deep brown pour with a small tan head that cuts in half, sticks, and laces in thick rings. Rich, complex aroma with roasted coffee, dark chocolate, dark fruits, and grains. Super sweet flavor, both chocolate and fruits, with more sweetness, a touch of coffee, and lingering, almost creamy sweetness. Not bad, but too sweet.","Georgia, USA","drowland"
3665,"2012-04-04",3.5,"Pizzeria Paradiso, Alexandria cask ($9): Pours a black colour with a sexy lookin creamy head. Aroma is coffee, chocolate, and way less hop and roasted malt forward than normal Engine Oil. Taste is surprisingly smooth. Nice chocolate and coffee notes mingled with that roasted malt feel. In honesty, this is not all that special, but it is quite good. Alcohol content is well covered. Easy drinking.","Nueva York, New York, USA","mansquito"
3665,"2012-03-26",3.3,"The Happy Gnome Firkin Fest, 12. From a firkin of course. Black and nearly still.  Thick palate.  Heavily roasted, nearly burnt, as the description says.  A hint of red meat, and a dry finish.  Well hopped, for the style.  Not their best, too much roasted character.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
3665,"2012-03-22",3.3,"Bottle. Pours brown black with a foamy khaki head that settles to a thin foamy film and shows some lacing. Aroma is muted peat and malt. Taste is creamy and smokey peat with a subtle sweetness of molasses and vanilla and finishes slightly bitter. Palate is full and creamy with a little stickiness that finishes dry and chalky.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"
3665,"2012-03-19",4.0,"Dark and syrupy pour....small copper toned head.  Aroma is roasted coffee and chocolate and those tastes come through as you drink it.  Over the palate, the roastiness continues.  Finish is a bit doughy and theres a slight hop bitterness at the end.  Nice drink.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","Heavyhitter"
3665,"2012-03-16",3.3,"330ml Bottle:  Aroma of malt, roasting, soy sauce, smoke, peat, burnt malt, and slight molasses.

3665,"2012-03-12",3.6,"cask @ redlight redlight.  Bitter coffee on the nose with a strong roasted malt aroma.  Pours black with an off white head.  Bitter roasted malts with coffee and bakers chocolate, hints of fruitiness in the middle that gets washed away with bitter hops and roasted barley.  Finishes with earthy coffee.  Very nice.","Orlando, Florida, USA","redlight"
3665,"2012-03-12",4.2,"Appearance: stout-like--near black, with a short, creamy, tan head and some light lace rings.   Aroma: chocolate, coffee, molasses, graham crackers, hint of raisins.   Taste: as the aroma indicated, with additional hints of anise, herbs, vanilla, cream, and a whisper of black pepper.   Finish: smooth and chocolatey, with lingering light, mellow hops and rich black malts.   Notes: Outstanding old ale.  I love the traditional Old Engine Oil, and this is even more flavorful, but smoother.  Couldnt believe this was 9% ABV.  I need to do a side-by-side with the regular Old Engine Oil.","Maryland, USA","JDBaker11058"
3665,"2012-03-11",3.5,"Black and murky, warm-brown crema head.  Aroma of coffee and muddy lake water, touch of pine sap.  hint of milk chocolate.  Dry earth.  Flavor is herbal grass, touch of roasted barley coupled with puckery hop bitterness.  Again, light muddy lakewater.  hint of bbq sauce.  Medium body, fine, prickly carbonation.  Good, not as intense as I was expecting.  Slight hint of medicinal herb comes through in the flavor now too.  I also got a touch of smoke near the end of the glass.  Nice beer, probably not worth the 6$ though.  Very complex for a 3.5.","Providence, Rhode Island, USA","PapaSkeetSkeet"

3665,"2012-02-28",4.2,"UPDATED: DEC 12, 2015 Fruit/candy sweetness and malts in aroma.  The flavor is caramel, fruit (a mix of sour and sweet) along with a good, complex malt backbone.  This had more fruit in the flavor than most old ales and made it unique.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
3665,"2012-02-25",3.7,"Ar: Dark caramel and molasses - a touch of moss, too.
Ap: Black and dense with very slight brown highlights on the edges - very small light mocha head that leaves just a touch of lacing.
T: Cocoa and raisins up front - burnt caramel, a bit vinous - medium bitterness that creeps up slowly - slightly savory on the finish, almost meaty, with some clean alcohol warmth, moss, and heavy dose of roast and dark fruit.
P: Medium-full body with medium-low carbonation - finish is medium-dry.
O: A spot-on old ale, really hits the spot on this cold February evening - complex and satisfying, with a nice interplay between the hops, alcohol, esters, and malt.","Plainfield, Vermont, USA","Jabic"

3665,"2012-02-03",3.6,"33cl bottle: Pours a mostly opaque black with mahogany edges and a thin-lacing froth of light tan head.  Has a lightly sweet and smoky peat nose with some dark chocolate notes.  Body starts with pretty good fullness and sweet dark malts with some phenolic roasted peat flavors and slightly grassy hop bitterness before a slightly drier finish.  Has decent complexity and smooths out as it warms up, but started with some metallic character.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3665,"2012-01-20",2.8,"On cask. Super dark brown pour with no head. Huge medicinal bandaid and nail polish remover in the nose lead to a flavor of roasted smokey malts, and bakers chocolate. Medium body with low carbonation and a chalky finish.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"

3665,"2012-01-12",4.0,"11.2 ounce bottle.  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with about an inch tan head.  Head retention is decent, and theres a lot of lacing left behind on the glass.  The brew smells like roasted malt, chocolate, coffee and some molasses.  It tastes like roasted malt, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, dark fruit and some burnt/charred malt.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit creamy and coating, and has a good amount of carbonation.  I cant tell this is a 9% ABV beer at all, the alcohol is hidden very well.  I think this is a good overall brew, Id certainly buy this again in the future.  Definitely worth trying!","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"
