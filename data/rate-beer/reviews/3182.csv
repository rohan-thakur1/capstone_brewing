3182,"2014-06-02",2.3,"w zapachu ryż, słodkie kwiaty i sporo alkoholu. dość przyjemny. kolor przejrzysty, jak lekko posłodzona woda. w smaku słodko, lekko kwiatowo, wyczuwalne nuty śliwki, ale dość mocno czuć alkohol. pozostawia lekko cierpkie uczucie w ustach. niezły stosunek ceny do jakości.","POLAND","czlowiekwiadro"
3182,"2014-01-03",2.7,"1.8 liter bottle, given as a gift, and opened about 10 months later. Nose of caramel, milk, yogurt, rice. Relatively unimpressive. Clear and light looking. Sweet, light caramel and rice, alcohol, some peach and melon. Simple but not bad. Body also fairly solid. Nothing special, but more drinkable than I expected.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
3182,"2011-07-30",2.8,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2014 I am not a sake maven, but I enjoy some from time to time.  I had this cold, since it was in July that I tried it.  Light, clear pour.  Fairly sugary sake, with some nice nutty & herbal notes.  Enjoyably warm on the palate while being a little cool on the tongue.  I had it again in 2013 - the junmai variety - warm this time.  I unexpectedly found a bottle at a liquor store in a Latino neighborhood and grabbed it.  Pretty dry, smooth, and sharp, with notes of burnt rice, mint, and juniper.  Not too sugary like some of the inexepensive California-made sakes have become.","USA","Slipstream"
3182,"2011-05-23",2.6,"Clear pour with a slightly thick appearance. Aroma is a bit musty with some overripe fruit and tart apple skins. Flavor is lightly fruity, banana melon and apples a bit of solvent and and earthy, musty, boozy finish. Palate is medium bodied, dry, but fairly smooth on the palate. Decent.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"
3182,"2010-12-07",3.3,"Bottle.  Pours a slightly yellow tinged clear water color. Sweet and somewhat buttery, with some floral isopropyl hints and some overripe melon.  Slight warm rice aromas.  Medium bodied but thins out a bit, sweet and warm old melons.  Warming alcohol on the finish with more sweet candy flavors.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
3182,"2008-10-31",3.1,"Clear.  Aroma of butter, rice and paper.  Light mold and floral taste.  Quite a sweet finish.  Not great, but a lot better than I was anticipating.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
3182,"2008-05-06",2.7,"300mL Bottle. Noses in a sharp, lightly acidic sulfur. Minerals. Pours a gasoline-color, with shiny opalescence. Flavor is a bit coarse, with some higher alcohols and nibble of plant material. Some cucumber and pear try to call through the rocket-fuel essence, but really this is just a little tough to swallow. Leaves some residual sugars on the palate. Not really that enjoyable.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
3182,"2008-01-02",2.3,"Bottle served hot: My first rating for Sake and I am definitely not a specialist. Very light taste of alcohol with some light rice notes. Body appears a bit thin and easier to drink that the last time I had some sake.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Boutip"
3182,"2007-12-30",1.8,"my first sake. not as smooth or light as i thought it would be. takes a while to get used to. its not horrible. But I wouldnt recommend it to a newbie, they might never try any sake again. Palidor19 got the description pretty accurate.","Ohio, USA","justinrobb"
3182,"2007-05-01",2.6,"Quite a harsher sake than what I am normally used too. The alcohol flavor is very present and the Rice is also apparent, strange funky after ending that hits you hard at the end.","Brandon, Florida, USA","Palidor19"
3182,"2007-05-01",2.1,"The aroma is strong with alcohol, rice, and wood. The appearance is clear with a slight yellow hue. The flavor is like the aroma but slightly sweet. The palate is thin but oily. Overall its a pretty average sake that is stronger when heated.","Tampa, Florida, USA","nick76"
3182,"2006-12-31",2.9,"Bottle at China Inn, Wichita, KS.  Pours a clear um, clear, with an aroma of striking alcohol and plumb.  The pleasantries end there... Grainy taste with the alcohol much too prominent.  Watery mouthfeel.  Ill pass next time.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"
3182,"2006-03-14",2.1,"Aroma was similar to dry white wine but with grainy accents, high alcohol easy to spot. Clear sake. Rather thin with out much depth, slightly grain, citric with cheap dry alcoholic finish. Poor.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"

3182,"2006-01-11",2.6,"Bottle.  Malty rice, soy and alcohol aroma.  Yellow tinged water appearance.  Light plum and rice malt flavor with a soy sauce and alcohol burn finish.  The flavor is much better than the aroma would lead you to believe.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
3182,"2006-01-07",2.0,"Bottle from LCBO- Crystal clear transparent. Mild fruit aroma sided with booze and chemicals. Poor vodka flavour, raw potatoes. Half cooked white rice. Burning finish. Not that great. Cam-pai!","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"
3182,"2005-11-04",1.9,"Pale, with harsh aroma. Cheap smelling. 
Way too piney, not fruity at all. Tastes like paint thinner.","Ucluelet, British Columbia, CANADA","natrat"
3182,"2005-10-10",2.1,"Clear as water.  A light fruit aroma.  Alcohol in the flavor as well as very light fruit. Harsh; at least to me, but also full bodied.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
3182,"2005-08-11",2.6,"Transparent. Chaud. Arômes de bananes dalcool et de poires. Saveurs de bananes, de poires, dananas, dalcool, de coconut, de pomme verte. En refroidissant, il devient très sucré. Trop probablement...","Saint-Ours, Quebec, CANADA","Miguel"
3182,"2005-04-29",2.5,"Bottle, from Sainsburys (14.5%). Almost clear except for a gentle lemony hint, no head or condition. Interesting milky melony spirity nose, full bodied in the mouth with alcoholic notes dominant. Some fruitiness with more hints of melon and low starch. Alcoholic and spicy finish.","Isle Of Beer, Lincolnshire, ENGLAND","rauchbier"
3182,"2005-03-28",2.6,"From a 750 ml bottle.  Very pale straw colour, as close to colourless a sake as Ive ever seen.  Aroma shows light tapioca, a hint of vanilla and a bit of charcoal.  Flavour is quite alcoholic, but there is a faint creamy flavour, and some light tapioca sweetness.  Surprisingly full-bodied.  A little bit fruity, with suggestions of pear and apricot.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
3182,"2004-11-15",1.6,"Strong alcoholic aroma with some light underlying sweetness and a hint of a smokey character. Appearance is similar to a very clear, pale white wine. Strong alcohol burn and simple sweetness mask a light bean-like flavour. Fairly thin. This was my first introduction to the world of Sake and paired fairly well with the sushi I was eating but all in all, Id not consider this a beverage that would stand alone. Bottle served hot at a local Sushi restaurant.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
3182,"2004-10-06",2.3,"UPDATED: OCT 26, 2004 180ml Bottle with the plastic Sake Cup on the top. A decent warmth and pear flavor to this sake, perfectly clear with a faint fruitiness to the rice aroma. Sweet and only a mild burn, a cheap sake but still a good deal for 3 bucks.","Washington, USA","beerinmarch"
3182,"2004-04-16",1.7,"(750ml bottle) Pours a slightly cloudy, pale yellow body. The nose reminds me of Bek Se Ju though more malted and less waterchestnuts. The burn on this is not pleasant. I think its less complex and lacks the layers of the 18% ABV - Tenzan Junmai Genshu. I definitely like the draft version more.","Victoria, British Columbia, CANADA","CapFlu"
3182,"2004-02-07",1.7,"Pale, pale yellow body.  Fairly malty and sticky aroma.  I agree with the alcohol statements.  It's not a great experience all around.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"
3182,"2004-02-07",1.6,"Almost totally clear, with a yellow-ish tint - the aroma reminds me of poor-quality scotch - flavor lacks complexity...no, that's an understatement, it doesn't really taste like much of anything - some sugar, grain, maybe a little honey - alcohol is extremely evident - seeing that this is a low end sake, I wasn't expecting much, and I can see how, if it's made right, this could be tasty stuff, I just didn't want to buy something expensive only to find out I really disliked sake - this is def. poor quality, but I'm sure that if I have some good stuff I will like it - this stuff, however, has a date with my sink drain.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
3182,"2004-01-31",1.9,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2004 Sugary pear aroma. Appearance has a yellow tint. Very sweet flavor with an alcohol burn. Little to be detected here just sugar water and alcohol. Even this low end class of sake has better examples based on my limited experience.","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
3182,"2004-01-28",1.4,"UPDATED: FEB 13, 2004 This is the yellowest thing since Bek Se Ju.  No wonder they put it in a reddish bottle.  I swear, it looks just like chardonnay.  Strong aroma of hazelnuts and creme liqueur.  Very rich, full mouthfeel that swishes around in your mouth like a brick.  Uncomplicated to say the least, and the alcohol burn is significant.  Drink at your own risk!","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
