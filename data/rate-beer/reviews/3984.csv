3984,"2017-05-23",4.0,"Pours black, bit hazy, with creamy light brown long lasting head. Aroma: moderate to low hop aroma with notes of stone fruits, pine, some citruses, supported - or better - overpowered by (dark) malts notes and mokka & espresso coffee. Flavour follows aroma: intense, rich mokka, espresso coffee, malts with notes of toasted toffee, chocolate and hop profile with notes of stone fruits, berry, citruses, pine. Theres some ashy notes, but they dont clash with hops. Hop bitterness is moderate medium, finish is slightly dry, with light roast charackter (without astringency!) and moderate to medium bitterness. Medium body, smooth texture, medium carbonation.

I couldnt decide what to pour it into, so chose a Chimay chalice in the end: it looked fine. Rich, deep foaming head of lovely tanned, creamy bubbles, sat on top of a jet black body, the creamy topping stayed around for the whole drink, shrinking in size, but staying the distance intact.

Intense bitter hop aroma somehow seeps through the creamy head, coffee smells within a malty base come later as the beer warms a little.

The taste is a coffee/chocolate infused bitter hop monster: dark Bourneville chocolate soaked in over roasted malts, deep and malty, yet with an overriding hop bitterness.

The huge blend of flavours almost hide the alcohol content, but not quiet.

Body is smooth and nearly creamy in nature, but its more robust than that and the hop content gives some nice rough edges and a final bite.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"
