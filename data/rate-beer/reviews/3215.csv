Pours with an over-sized frothy head over an amber body with coarse (artificial?) carbonation visible.
Aroma of earthy and fruity hops, with a more earthy and less fruity flavor. Bold and hop forward for style. Mild+ bitterness. 
Medium body and medium-high carbonation.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
3215,"2015-11-28",3.1,"Super refreshing and crisp with a nice lingering noble bitterness, light floral and citrus. Very easy going, full of grainy and crisp saaz hops. Very nicely done.","Alberta, CANADA","patricks110"

3215,"2015-09-27",3.1,"355ml can pours a darker golden color with a finger and a half of white head that settles quite quickly leaving only a few spots of lacing on the glass. Aroma is grassy with some citrus and cereal grains. Taste is a grassy and citrusy hop bitterness with a malty sweetness. Grainy mouth feel. Light bodied with average carbonation. A respectable brew that suits the style well, but nothing special.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
3215,"2015-09-26",3.6,"24K coloured Lager with a 2 finger head of foam, poured cold.

It smells grainy, malty, very light bitter note. The grain isnt all that strong so extra points for that.

Malty semi sweetness in the taste, light grain, an earthy type of hop bitterness with a mild spice character.

Exceptionally smooth with enough flavour to satisfy my taste buds, this is another delicious Lager from the gang at Orlison.","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"
3215,"2015-07-14",3.1,"Medium dark gold -(not pale) big foamy head. Aroma grain bin, ozone lemons citrus. tastes sweet, sacharine even, wheat tea. Not much hops at all. Sorta perfumy. Too sweet, too caramely.","Seattle, Alabama, USA","nealblind"
3215,"2015-05-16",3.6,"Clear copper with a lasting, firm white head. A bit of grain and sweet malt in the aroma with light earth, too. Medium, crisp body. Flavor is much like the aroma with a slight bitter finish. Not a flavor powerhouse by any stretch, but a rap solid warm weather brew. Refreshing.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"

Light honey sweetness, light fruitiness in the finish. Dont get any hops really. Just a very light bitterness. Nice, smooth, dry lager.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
3215,"2014-04-06",2.9,"16 oz can bought from ""lifesource"" in Salem.
$2.49
Pours a clear golden colour with a large thick and rocky white head.
Actually typical ""macro"" lager aromas..sweet malts ,paper and some bread.
Taste again like the usual industrial lagers but a tad sweeter and a lot cleaner..sweet honey and a touch of hop.
Plate is just fine for style light and drinkable.
Good clean American lager.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"

3215,"2013-10-21",3.4,"16oz prototype can. Not exactly pale. Between golden and amber. Great head and retention, but only weak malt aroma. Biscuity caramel, nuances of toastiness, and modest hop bitterness come out on the nose, and the hips follow through the creamy and clean finish. A wonderfully textured, surprisingly substantial ""pale"". Not my usual style but... definitely something Id like to have with food.","Spokane, Washington, USA","xenodius"
3215,"2013-06-21",2.4,"Draught at Northern Quest. Pours a crystal clear golden color with a moderate off-white head on it. Nose is pretty light, but with a faint whiff of a typical lager smell. Taste is has a little bit of corn in there with your typical lager taste. Nothing remarkable about this.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"
3215,"2011-07-09",3.9,"On tap at the Spokane Indians game last night. You never know when and where youre going to come across a beer youve never rated before! First things first: theres no way this is a pale lager. Whoever listed this on here doesnt know what theyre talking about. For one thing, its not pale. Its a deep gold to almost amber. It has an off-white, almost light-beige head. It leaves really nice lacework and has a head that takes awhile to recede. Name me one pale lager with those attributes. Similarily, the nose is nice and full of hops. Its a little piney, a little grainy. The taste is bittersweet with a somewhat bitter finish (not like IPA bitter, but definitely more bitter than any pale lager Ive ever had). It has a biscuity flavor.The carbonation is medium-high and the body is medium. At the time of drinking it, I thought it was a pale ale. I had never heard of this beer or brewery before seeing the tap handle, so I had no information on it. The guy pouring it told me they were out of Airway Heights and that was the only thing I learned about it. Ive since visited their website and found out that it is indeed a lager. If anything Id say its a premium lager, but most definitely not a pale lager. Beer Advocate has it listed as an American Amber/Red Lager, which doesnt seem very accurate either, but more on the mark than ""pale lager."" The beer it most resembles to me is Sam Adams Noble Pils, which is listed as a Bohemian Pilsner. Maybe thats the more accurate category for this beer. Okay, Im done.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"
3215,"2011-03-16",3.5,"Draft at ncbc. Pours a hazy medium amber with a nice sudsy white head. Plenty of stringy lace. Most gorgeous pale lager ever man. Mild nutty nose. Caramel, brown bread, peanuts, and a bit of grassy hop on the mid palate. Mild biscuity finish. Clean and easy drinking.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
3215,"2010-11-28",2.2,"Rich gold body with a lovely creamy, egg-nog colored head. Saaz hop nose, grassy, earthy. Saazy flavor, some sourdough and a touch of soap. Not my thing.","Seattle, Washington, USA","BillKismet"
