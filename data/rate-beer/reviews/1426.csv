1426,"2017-04-23",3.9,"Wow, cant recall the last time I had a beer from Vermont, also had not previously heard of a ""double altbier;"" regardless, this is a delicious super-malty brew, pours a rich slightly cloudy amber-brown color, cool caramel and brown sugar malt aroma. Medium-full bodied with a lot of texture, almost chewy like caramel toffee. Flavor is multiple layers of sweet malty and red fruit notes, reminiscent of a doppelbock.

1426,"2017-02-26",3.7,"While this isnt quite a barn burner, this is a very solid offering from Long Trail and the best beer of theirs that I have tried so far. It pours a nice rosy brown with a thick tan head. The taste is of a malty mouthfeel with chocolatey notes and a bit of a yakky baltic aftertaste. It goes down relatively easy, but sneaks up on you. Never really had an altbier consciously before, but this is basically a mid point between an amber ale and brown ale with a bit more alcoholic kick. Worth a shot if youre in the mood and like dark, malty brews. Otherwise, it is not a tragedy to miss out on this one.","New Haven, Connecticut, USA","meccahh69lol"

1426,"2016-10-17",3.0,"On tap at Quarry House Tavern in Silver Spring, MD. 

Clear, copper-orange with a small an off-white head and excellent lacing. 

Aroma of orange, caramel and honey. 

Taste of caramel, wood, orange, honey, alcohol and bitter resin with a bitter rotten fruit aftertaste. Very strange. There is a clash between the basic malt and fruit flavor and the weird aftertaste. 

Medium/full body and medium carbonation with a nice mouthfeel. 

There is much to like in this beer, but nearly as much to dislike. It's a pity about that aftertaste.

Appearance  The beer pours an amber color with a two finger off white head. The head fades over a moderate level of time to give a decent level of lacing. 

Smell  The aroma is bready and malty with some notes of caramel and some herbal hop. 

Taste  The taste begins with a lightly roasted and bready taste. Upfront there is a caramel taste that melds with the bready tastes well. Soon some bitter grapefruit and lemon hop flavors come to the tongue. Shortly after arriving these flavors seem to lose their strength. As the lemon and grapefruit dwindle a bitter herbal flavor comes to the tongue. This herbal flavor intensifies to the end where they combined with a light alcohol flavor to leave a malty and lightly bittered flavor on the tongue.

Mouthfeel  The mouthfeel is on the rather average side, but kind of thin for a 7.2 % abv brew. Its carbonation level was moderate and rather appropriate for the style.

Overall  It was a decent brew. It had some good malty flavors and a light herbal hop. Worth a try, but nothing that is super exceptional. A decent stronger Alt. style ale.","","Darkmagus82"

A: Pours a clear copper color. The head is a one finger off-white shade, and while its relatively creamy looking, it doesnt have the best retention.

S: The malt is typically toffee-forward, but with that faint German touch to it. Namely, stone fruits and just a hint of diacetyl. Theres a hop profile thats very mellow yet still noticeable. Not bad, not bad at all.

T: Loads of toffee start this one off. The flavor even gets faintly nutty at times, with some nice apricot notes right after the swallow. There does seem to be a touch of alcohol flavor (along with a faint burn) on the finish. I have to say that overall, the flavor profile isnt my cup of tea.

M: Its actually kind of coarse, and even slightly angular in feel. This helps to give it pretty good drinkability in spite of its maltiness. Carbonation is light, which somehow suits this one.

Lots of dark fruit including cherry, prune and plum. There is a moderate noble hop character as well as a moderate bitterness. Light alcohol spice in the finish. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied with medium low carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol heat.

The aroma is pretty roasty and malty with an earthy, bready and toffee thing going on. The taste of the beer is leaning more toward a peaty, malty sweetness that moves to a coffee type bitter finish. Not to say it tastes like coffee in any way, but rather it has the same type of finish that a coffee lends. Fairly complex. I didnt expect such things from an Altbier.

Sweet, lightly fruity, nutty and toasted malt aroma, with notes of brown and powdered sugar, caramel and bubblegum, some lighter suggestions of berry and spice as well.

Flavor is similarly dominated by malt and sweetness, more caramel/toffee to be found as well as a lighter bready character and some traces of earthy, herbal hop flavor and very mild bitterness, particularly at the finish.  Some lingering dried fruit and berry aspects very late.  For all of the sweetness, it does finish relatively clean, but certainly falls short of being able to be termed refreshing.

1426,"2010-03-17",4.0,"If you know me you know I prefer a hoppy beer to a malty one, but you should also know that I appreciate a tasty beer no matter which way it leans. Long Trail Double Bag is one of the maltiest beers Ive ever encountered and yet I found it very delectable. POUR, COLOR AND AROMAThe beer pours smoothly to a clear, dark amber color which is almost a shade of brown proper. The head is average-sized, off-white, and foamy. It dissolves rather quickly, but it does leave a little lacing on the glass. The scent is a strong mixture of malt, caramel and what I would call an autumn-like aroma of wet leaves and pumpkin [Im quite sure its made with neither!]TASTEI hate it when its not clear what style a beer belongs to since it makes it a bit more difficult to prepare my frame of reference. Long Trails website describes Double Bag as a Strong Dark Ale but the label says its a stickebier which is basically a strong altbier. Whatever the case may be, the fact remains this beer does seem to have some very Germanic roots.Upon taking my first taste the flavors of caramel, chocolate and toffee were immediately noticeable. I also noticed a light, but seeming varied palate of spices such as nutmeg and cinnamon. Taking all these flavors into consideration, its no wonder this beer reminded me so much of an Oktoberfest brew even though its of a completely different style.Regardless, the fact remains Double Bag is quite a tasty beer. Its sweet and sticky not unlike the Long Trail Ale, only with a richer, smoother flavor. There is no bitterness or dryness to the flavor here, just a strong, non-threatening, array of sweetness and taste.FINISHThe label says, The secret is that this brew is so smooth, youd never believe it has an alcohol content of 7.2!!! [sic]. When I read that I scoffed at the notion, but after a few swigs I found a truthiness in it. The alcohol is masked very well and is only noticeable in the finish. Otherwise, Double Bag has a thick, but extremely gentle mouthfeel that coats the entire mouth in flavor. For such an otherwise strong ale its amazing how drinker-friendly this beer really is.BODYFollowing the note on the beers smoothness, the label also advises, INDULGE IN MODERATION!!!!!! [sic]. I could see why they would make such a disclaimer since the taste and drinkability are so good that the icing on the cake is the surprising absence of a heavy body. Although I only drank one bottle of this beer, I didnt feel as if I had drunk anything at all. This is a session beer in disguise.FINAL THOUGHTSI have to admit I wasnt expecting much from a beer with a picture of two cows on the label (what IS the deal with that, anyway?). Still, Long Trail Double Bag was one of the nicer surprises in my beer-drinking experience and I wish I had more to appreciate. This would make a great inclusion in one of their mix packs since its superior to their otherwise average line of brews.

Received this is a recent trade with israel, thanks again! Long Trails Double Bag fills the glass a perfectly clear amber with orange highlights throughout the glass. Carbonation rises from all over the bottom of the glass. The off white head grew to two fingers on the pour and after a few drinks settled to a solid cap leaving chunky lace lines behind. This is a very good looking beer.

The first thing thats hits me in the aroma is the nuttiness from the malt. Theres a touch of floral hoppiness floating around in the background and a nice addition of caramel throughout that adds to the nuttiness. Theres a ghost like alcohol presence just sort of gliding through here and there.

The flavor follows the aroma fairly closely. A malt driven caramel and nuttiness lead the way allowing the floral hoppiness to rise and fall throughout. The hops even show a touch of citrus on the tongue. The alcohol is a little more pronounced in the flavor then the nose suggested but overall this is a good beer.

The mouthfeel of this beer is the standout point. Double Bag is luxuriously rich and creamy right off the bat. The body slides through without a problem. The only thing keeping this from getting a 5 is that it seems to get a little light in the back of the throat and a little heat is present.

This is an easy enough beer to drink. Its a good beer but just seems a little dull. I would happily drink a few in a sitting but the abv could catch up rather easy after a couple more.

This is a solid alt from Long Trail. Although alts really arent something I drink all that often this was an enjoyable beer. I wouldnt mind giving this another try if I had a couple more. Thanks again Israel.

In long: Nose of sweet red fruits, candies, crème-caramel and aromatic flowers.  Body is rather full and carbonation is comfortably relaxed.  A lot of dried fruits, citrus, some hard-candies and quite a bit of smooth caramel.  A hefty dose of floral hops really juice up the beer and distracts from the sweetness.  Very clean.

When drinking an alcoholic beverage, I kinda like to know it. That said, there is really nice complexity to this beer that goes beyond the fact that it packs a wallop. I very much enjoy it pre-dinner. Its rather on the rich side, with a nice caramelly sweetness, but not at all cloying.

The flavor is really pretty good.  Big sweet malt, rounded with hints of raspberry popping out.  Theres clearly some hops in here, lending that raspberry bit once again.  The finish is a bit tart, though its a burnt roasted malt sort of tartness.  Strange indeed The aftertaste is more of this burning.

1426,"2006-10-02",4.2,"Very clear lightened copper color with a big, bold ivory capping of frothy foam. Keeps its cap well throughout the seesion. Big patchy lacing sticks in place across the glass.

Aroma is of toasted grains and breads with a nice graasy undertone to it. Clean, crisp, inviting.

Taste is more of the same, nicely mild, wholesome, natural, and easy goin toasted tones of bread grains that drift long with grassy hopped undertones that add a unique leafy bitterness of fluffy pine to the finish. A very light and tender caramel sweetened warmth resides off to the side then brings up the rear after the finish to sit with a malty warming sensation in the back of the throat.

Feel is soft, smooth, semi-silky, and just above a medium body within a lower carbonation level and only the slight hoppy bitterness and the malty warmth adding to the supply of interest in texture and length.

Quite a drinkable treat. Smooth, mild, subtle, and warming with just that right kinda of balance and roundedness that makes for a good beer. Alt style, and the like. Good stuff.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

A slim nuttiness dances along and is joined by a pleasant roast aroma as the beer warms.  Hops are a smidge more than Id like, lending a distinctly brassy tinge to the aroma and flavor.  The fermentation might also be a bit high or the cold storage a tad short as there are some fruity esters (pear and apple, mainly) that I dont generally enjoy in an Altbier.  Theres a vibrant sweetness to this one and that blends quite well with the not-quite-thick oily smoothness of the body.

1426,"2006-01-28",4.7,"In keeping with the tradition of altbier from Dusseldorf, Long Trail decided in 1994, to brew up a stickebier or ""secret beer"" which is a bigger, stronger, rarer version of alt. Double Bag is a stickebier, or ""double alt"" that is a bigger, maltier, stronger version of Long Trail Ale. This beer was indeed a secret, much like the stickebiers of Dusseldorf, it could only be found on draught at the visitor center of the brewery. It was not advertised, and if you wanted it, you had to know the secret, and ask for it. But a beer this good can not stay a secret for long, and it got out of the double bag. So Long Trail decided to bottle this one, and make it availble year round. Long Trail Double Bag pours to a beautiful, bright, deep copper color with an off white head, and a moderate amount of carbonation. The nose is very malty, with aromas of sweet malt paired with some herbal hop aromas, and some estery fruit aromas. The body is slick on the tongue with lots of good caramel and toffee flavors with subtle flavors of estery fruit. Double Bag finishes with more big malty flavors up front, then ends with a wonderful, snappy, zesty burst of herbal/grassy hop bitterness. Double Bag comes in at 7.2% abv and is dangerously drinkable for a beer of this strength. 

I love this beer, and this beer style. Big malty character up front and a big burst of herbal hop bitterness in the finish. I think it is fantastic that a domestic brewery would do this very rare style of altbier. Double Bag is a very drinkable beer with lots of flavor, and would work well with hearty dishes. Match this one with some grilled bratwursts, or perhaps a classic German meal of saeurbraten, red cabbage, spatzel, and pumpernickel.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

An okay attempt at a ""double alt"", and I say that because compared to the Uerige Sticke that I also sampled this evening, this beer has a cheap tasting, sweet malt flavor, a moderate fruitiness, and a mildly bitter, but perfumy hop flavor.  Its certainly more flavorful than the regular Long Trail Ale, which is also an altbier, but as this beer proves, more flavor doesnt always mean more enjoyment.  The nose is sweet, malty and fruity.  Medium ""plus"" bodied, but that cheap, sugary sweetness just sits on the palate and becomes a bit cloying.  Dark amber in color and fully clear in appearance.

Clear garnet pour with ruby highlites under a thin tan head which dissapeared by the time I lifted the glass.  Very sweet aroma of malt, vanilla and overripe fruit.  This one explodes like a sweet malt bomb leaving little room for balancing flavors (such as hops, which were restrained to the point of being hidden).  I found the alcohol notes fairly obvious, though not unpleasant, leaving me with little doubt about this ales propensities for mischief.  Mouthfeel was quite thin and watery and finish very weak.  Overall, this beer would appeal to those who enjoy sweeter ales that lean decidedly towards the malty side of the spectrum.  Im also not certain this is an Alt - at least not a good example of the style.","Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA","GuilTTy"

Yeah, plenty, but you can't taste it. Soft, subtle, complex, yet such big maltiness. Easy to drink in the way that's it's just a great beer. Seriously underrated in my opinion.

Flavour has a lot of bitterness - woody - and dashes of caramel and breadcrusty malts.  The flavours are definitely not as bright as previous and the beer simply feels less alive as a consequence.  Alcohol hits late, as does a little brown sugar sweetness.  Not a bad beer, certainly respectable amongst the overall alt/amber field, but not a worldbeater either.  That was pretty much expected, though, as that first experience was so sublime.  Ar 6 Ap 3 F 7 P 3 O 14 = 3.3  Rating shown is aggregate of the two.

Deep amber; rich aroma with loads of malt, almonds, cashews, and hints of maple & bourbon; Huge malt palate - but with pleasing bitterness underneath flavours of plum, pear, rich caramel/toffee and earthy, toasted malts, mesquite smoke, more bourbon.  Finishes both sweet and earthy.  Very complex.  The best alt since Im Fuchschen. Ar 9 Ap 4 Fl 10 P 4 O 18 = 4.5","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"

1426,"2001-06-03",4.4,"Malty, candyish aroma.  Moderately full-bodied.  Thick, almost cloying lightly carmelized malt upfront.  Dries out in a BIG way by the end.  If this is how all Sticke beers taste, then Im getting my arse on a plane to Dusseldorf tomorrow, because this beer was flippin fantastic.  My thanks to Kaya161 for sending me this gem.","Sacramento, California, USA","Shadallion"
1426,"2000-11-30",3.7,"A very interesting brew. Ive not had many traditional Strong Ales such as this one in the past. Has a deep amber color; almost no head at all due to the low carbonation level for this style and the higher alcohol. The crystal malts dominate here with a sweet caramel flavor. Very smooth going down, but is a sipping beer to be served on the warmer side. The low CO2 level does make it seem a bit flat. Worth seeking out.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"
