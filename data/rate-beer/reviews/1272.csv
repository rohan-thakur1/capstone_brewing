1272,"2014-04-15",2.9,"12oz bottle into a pint glass.

Pours a hazy dark orange with quite a bit of sediment from the bottle making it into the glass. The saving grace is the thick, rocky head. Excellent retention and lacing.

Aroma is extremely fruity. Lots of orange with some grape and cherry as well. Maybe just a touch of biscuit but it is faint behind the fruit.

The taste has even more fruit. I know pretty much every Schlafly beer has this fruit note from what I assume to be the yeast but this is just a little overdone. Heavy dose of orange and cherry along the same lines as what is in the aroma. Lots of malt in the way of caramel and biscuit but it lends a bit too much sweetness. Mouthfeel is quite sweet and sticky.

Overall, this one just doesnt do it for me. Too much fruit and overly sticky make this a bit of a mess. Drinkability is very limited and it just doesnt seem that well put together. Ill pass next time.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

1272,"2014-01-09",2.9,"Bottle. Pours a clear copper body under a small fizzy off-white head that had pretty decent retention. The nose is pretty decent, rather hoppy for an ESB, some nice spicy rye, and some toasty malt. The flavor is pretty weird though, considering the style. Theres a lot of crystal malt sugariness to it that really dominates the flavor. Finishes with a touch of that rye spiciness you get in the nose, as well as just a touch of bitterness. The flavor is just too sweet and the toasty and dry malt I want in an ESB just isnt there. Light to medium bodied with fizzy carbonation and some lingering crystal malt sweetness.

1272,"2013-12-25",3.5,"The appearance of this beer combines a few intriguing elements: a cloudy orange color, a large off-white head, and fine-grain sediment. The aroma is reminiscent of caramel and bread malts fused with a hint of fruit, and the taste is an interesting blend of a mild sweetness and a slight sourness, leading to a nicely balanced beer.

1272,"2013-12-03",2.7,"In short: A muffled semi-hoppy amber ale lacking vivacity.
How: Bottle 12oz. Consumed as soon as we got it through private importation, but already 5 months after bottling date :(
The look: Slightly cloudy amber-orange body topped by a medium off-white head with medium retention leaving lots of lacings on the glass.
In long: Nose is dank and moist, like smelling leafy hops in a wet basement. In mouth the beer has a medium body, slightly oily mouthfeel and abundant carbonation. Taste is semi-toasted cereals, an awkward mix of caramel and marmalade, moldy fruits, soggy cookies, very dank hops. Overall this bottle was as far from bright and vibrant as a beer can get, everything here felt moldy, slightly rotten, dank. Not as bad my choice of words make it to be, but still a pretty lame experience. Might be because the bottle suffered from the private importation transit, it has to be. Not what I expect from an ESB, Schlafly may think I will believe this is an ESB because it is written ESB on the label but my mother didnt raise no fool (my father did while my mother ignored me because I was dumb)","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

1272,"2013-10-09",3.4,"A rather pale example, dark golden, covered by a light, lasting beige head. Tiny sediments settle at the bottom of the glass. Glorified esters and toasted, biscuity, caramelly malts which combine together in a sense of balance. Actually a bit lighter than I would have expected on the hop side where gently woodsy, earthy, orangey spicy hops do not quite egt over the appley, spicy, slightly sulphury even yeastiness which at times comprise a jammy fruity kick. Yet its dry/sweet balance is efficient, the initial biscuity sweetness burst being balanced by an earthy, smooth and clean bitterness to which the soft, but far from absent bubbles certainly contribute. Well, its good, but this was one of those beers, backs in the days, which used to be rated 3.8+ and was possibly even the top ESB on the site. Assuming it has not evolved, thats kinda mysterious (even though its scores have been on a downhill in recent years) as there are plenty of awesome examples (especially Yorks in my limited exposure) out there and I say that as a Schlafly fan who really appreciate their base beer portfolio, all clean and respectable, sometimes excellent straightforward recipes at very reasonable prices.

Palate : Average carbonation. Too strong for te style IMHO.

A - Pours a hazy amber, with 1 finger of yellow tinted meringue head. Very nice retention with below average lacing.

S - Bready, pureed peaches, caramel, honey sweet malt, hints of light lemon citrus.

T - Bready malts, light caramel, the peach fruit carries over from the aroma and melds very well with the soft bready malts. Theres notions of crisp lemon in there lightly cutting through the bready malt. Hops provide a tannin-like bitterness. Finishes bright and semi-dry.

M - Nice doughy texture, heavy side of medium, super soft carbonation, very nice texture.

1272,"2013-07-21",3.2,"My Bottom Line:
Orange confit and French toast allusions offer up a sweetish breakfast flavor profile, while biscuity undertones and earthy hops get together in the finish.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A healthy head of foam settles atop the misty orange.
-The mouthfeel is more carbonated than the average British brew (naturally carbonated, I mean).
-The overt yeastiness gets in the way of the malt and hop profile.
-This may be flavorful, but I am disappointed considering the high ratings for this one. If you like this, you have to go out to England since there are tons of brews with a similar flavor profile which are tighter and brighter.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a light to medium, orangey amber with an average to large, off-white head that kept a nice sheet and left good lacing. There were also tiny particles of a thick density floating in the body. The aroma had light caramel; moderate to heavy orangey hops; and other citrus fruits. The initial flavor was light to mod sweet and lightly acidic; while the finish was moderately sweet, moderately acidic; slightly bitter; and ever so slightly sour. There was a little caramel, tons of orange, spicy rye and other citrus.The slightly more than medium body was a little syrupy with fairly soft carbonation and a slightly metallic and ever so slightly astringent finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

This recipe gets the grainbill, color, gravity, and bittering units right, but the KIND of bitter is all wrong. I swear the hops were Cascade, which makes it taste 100% American, not English. This would be a fine American Amber Ale, just dont call it ESB. Tasted again in bottles on 12/26/2011 and my complaint stands: the hops were overwhelmingly American/grapefruity.

Smooth and rounded up front with an aggressive (for an ESB) resiny hop bite. A strange combination of a water-like mouthfeel but with a med-full body makes this very easy drinking. Light carbonation but it has a slight carbonic bite. Finish is semi-sweet with a medium bitterness. Pretty nice ESB.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
1272,"2007-12-13",3.7,"12oz bottle, courtesy of Gregis.  Thanks, Greg!  Pours a bright, clear yellowish-orange color; textured off-white head with good lacing.  Pleasant amounts of orange hops and toasty maltiness in the aroma; fruity, in an orange-infused way that makes me think of something from DFH; the English character doesnt make itself apparent at first.  Lively carbonation and soft, resiny hop character upfront; medium mouthfeel; oily orange and noble hops appear throughout, plenty of fruit, with a rye or grainy note appearing throughout; nothing rough, just well-balanced with an excellent upfront hop character.  Slightly mouthwatering and very fruity.  Dryness comes through in the finish, showing biscuity malts and minerals.  Tasty stuff.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

Whoa, surprisingly hoppy for an ESB, but the mildly sweet pale malt profile seems pretty timid in comparison.  I can really taste the grassy hops in this rather than just vague bitterness, though the level of bitterness isnt exactly shy here either.  Slightly grassy and grapefruity hops aroma.  Medium bodied, crisp and somewhat clean, pretty standard carbonation mouthfeel.  The beer is light amber in color with near perfect clarity.  The off-white head rises to almost an inch before settling down to a wide ring and leaving sporadic patchy lacing on the glass.  Overall, Im reminded of a very hoppy English ale rather than the American ESB I was expecting, though I would have known better had I read the label.  Its a pretty decent beer and the flavor of the bitter hops is pleasant, but for my tastes, theres far too little malt to keep the hops balanced.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Aroma is sweet, slightly stemmy hops (not very hoppy though). Kind of herbal I think, like the purple clover flowery things. 
That kind of carries over in to the taste. Flowery hops that fade into a soapy residue with a touch of sweetness.

Hops are floral and citrusy. Touch of rye and earthiness. This beer is sort of overbalanced towards the hops (lots of em) but there is a nice malt backbone as well. Nice beer. Malts are full and round. Finish is clean and sweet. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
1272,"2005-03-13",3.8,"This beer poured orange-amber with a slight haze, and small white foam.  Aroma is hoppy and bitter. Light malty front, with a hoppy middle, and bitter rye finish. I like it. This is one of my favorite hometown made beers.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","PhrankSlovacek"
1272,"2005-02-15",4.0,"Pours sparkly amber orange with a nice layer of cream-white head. Clean yeasty malt aromas, and minty, flowery hops. Very soft and pleasant. Beautifully layered flavors--nice bitter minty-lemon hops right off the bat, followed by a warming bready maltiness, and a nice yeasty finish. Soft clean palate. A terrific full-flavored ESB that rewards sipping, but is balanced enough to be very drinkable.","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"

Pours with a deep amber and slow, lazy bubbles. A huge white head tops it off. This could be because it was delivered today. The aroma is nice and malty with some notes of grass and cola. The taste is a nicely malty and roasted. Some notes of fresh soybeans. A weird sweet note in the background.  A fairly nice ESB, but not world class.

1272,"2004-02-13",3.5,"Bottled 11/26/03  Pours a slightly hazed amber with a creamy off-white head. The aroma is that of earthy and flowery hops with lots of sweet malt. The flavor is slight caramel then lots of flowery/fruity hops with medium to light bitterness. There are hints of rye but it is really very far back in the mix. The body is medium-full and seems to be substantiated a good bit by the rye. A good beer overall. Possibly misclassified as an ESB, seems more of an APA to me. It lacks the sweet cinnamon character I like in an ESB.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
1272,"2004-01-17",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 19, 2005 2003 bottle.  First off, thanks to Emily for sendin this gem as an extra.  Pours about as good as you can get without being bottle conditioned.  Good sized yellow-white head and a marvelous deep red-amber color.  Dirty brown and yellow waves as well, quite bright.  Smells very full and strong, lots of hops and a slightly spicy/peppery aroma.  Mellow and dry caramel as well.  Flavor is superb.  First off you get a great bitter hops flavor from some nice english-style hops.  On the background is a dry caramel-earthy/root flavor.  Almost tastes like there is some anise in there, but thats probably the rye.  Body is perfect and flavor is strangely subtle yet full, as a good bitter should be.  Beer definitely grows on you as you drink it and the aftertaste of sweet molasses/caramel and low acid hops is wonderful.  If this was bottle conditioned, this would be one of the best beers ever made.  I hope to test that theory at the brewery with the cask version.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1272,"2004-01-16",3.5,"Malty, nutty nose just like Avery ESB, with a similar utty malt flavor that has a surisingly long finish, sustained, and indeed urged on, by hop bitterness.

1272,"2003-12-13",4.1,"A very nice Winter offering. If it were darker I'd swear it was a PNW beer.

Pours an amber color with a respectable head and a very nice lace.

The scent is *very* hoppy, which explains in part my PNW comment. There's a nice malt component there as well.

Taste...hoppy for sure, with a citrus aftertaste. Far more malts than an IPA, of course, but not quite balanced enough for style (one of my favorites). There just doesn't seem to be enough meat to this. I think the hops would mellow and the beer become more complex with a few months aging.

Mouthfeel is good but just a bit thin for my preferences. Overall this is a very good winter beer.","Port Orchard, Washington, USA","Gromit"
1272,"2003-12-08",3.4,"Orangey-amber.  Hazy.  Wispy white head.   Chewy, caramelly earthiness and mango fruitiness in the aroma.

1272,"2003-12-02",4.2,"Bottle 

<P>

Brilliantly clear, vibrant pale amber with a foamy tan head that settles to a respectable cap with crazy lacing.  The aroma is well balanced between the leafy, floral hops and the malt which is bready, toffeeish, and nutty.  A bit of rye spiciness rounds it out, and adds some complexity.  The flavor starts out firmly bitter, and while the bitterness stays strong throughout, all of the malt complexities come out around the midway point.  Lots of toffee, toasted bread, and nuttiness form a wonderful backbone underneath the biting, floral hop bitterness and flavor, which combine with the rye for a spiciness which accentuates both the hops and malt.  Round and medium in body, with a lingering dryness from the rye on the finish.  Ends with a splash of hop flavor.  Overall, a fantastic ESB and a hearty winter brew that I look forward to every year.  Its worth noting that this is heavenly when cask-conditioned from Schlaflys hand pump.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MarkR"

It also shows incredible maltiness and freshness. Mine was bottled on 10/30/2002 and it might have well been yesterday. Deep tangy malt, huge hop presence everywhere, exceptional lacing and body, and a crisp sharpness that must be imparted by the rye (I'm guessing). Clean clear and wonderful and a great seasonal surprise sent by the St. Louie wunderkind -- btw, love the cat and the computer screen in the background.
