Aroma had some nice funky barnyard qualities. There was a mild hint of smoke and esters. Flavor was nice there was a slight tartness to it. Smoke was a surprising presence in the finish. Carbonation was perfect. Easy to drink.","New York, USA","crazyvin"
2561,"2013-10-08",4.2,"On tap @ Prohibition Pig (Waterbury). Slightly hazy bright golden with a small persistent white head and some lacing. Aroma is incredible and powerful with red wine (really present), brettanomyces, some fruity notes, light spices and oak tannins. Taste is slightly sweet and milder than aroma with a nice red wine touch, brettanomyces, oak tannins, light spicy notes and red fruits. Light to medium body. Lively carbonation at first that mostly stops after a few minutes. Tannic and winey mouthfeel. This beer is mostly defined by the barrel treatment as the Brunello is the main feature in the aroma and taste, but its so good that I cant give a lesser note. Quite drinkable despite the heavy wine presence. I loved it and even ordered a 2nd glass!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

2561,"2013-10-03",3.5,"Bottle, cheers Mr. Drake. The pours medium gold with a small head. The nose is that general farty yeasty funk that you get in every Stillwater beer. This isnt a great calling card, lads. The taste is nice rich, grape. Apple and honey. Lightly tart. More Stillwater house yeast character. Light body, moderate carbonation. Pretty tasty. Not bad.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
2561,"2013-09-30",4.0,"I was stunned when I saw this Brunello barrel aged ale was Golden. It felt natural to me that this would have been darker and I was glad to be proven wrong. Im very fond of Brunellos though and were it not for the hefty price tag, Id drink one every month. This hazy golden alternative comes with a robust white head and a powerful aroma. Pretty sharp barrel notes with stewed grapes, figs and just a general dark fruity depth accompanying tannic oak with a certain wild character, very phenolic anyway and toasty to the point of feeling spicily smokey. The beer below is spicy, pale, seemingly on the dry side, gently floral and not very malty save for now understated cereal notes. Effervescence is initially fairly vigorous in this relatively thin beer, but it does fade out after a few minutes to a level which showcases the soft tannins with greater interest. The barrel steals the show. Attractive and convincing, albeit stripping lots of character from the beer underneath. In other words, if this flavour profile were as ubiquitous as bourbon barrels are these days, Id probably go ""meh"", but its extremely rare, so I go ""how interesting"" and would be very curious to try a few more renditions before I grow tired and look for something more drinkable.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Big tangy nose; showing some vinous acidity as well as some tart basement funk and a little bit of pulpy vegetal wet leaves. This combination is far more appealing than words might suggest. Its a whole greater than the sum of its parts, to be sure, and very inviting in an overripe tree fruit sort of way. Creamy medium body with lively carb.

Nose is soft citrus acid, pleasant lemon and orange rind, a nice fresh cracked barley. Mouth is gently sweet orange rind upfront, very pleasant soft citric acids, soft grain throughout. I enjoy the barrel influence that is prominent but completely not wine like, rather oak and secondary yeast elements that really impart a nice citrus action.

Dry and slightly tart flavour with pineapple and grapefruit, and a faint yeasty touch. I could drink a lot of this, and often, if only it was available","Odense, DENMARK","Christian"

2561,"2012-02-20",3.4,"On tap. Pours a hazy golden with a creamy white head. Amazing Brett aroma - were talking Lambic territory here. The body is fairly light, some fruitiness, notes of dry white wine (yeah, WHITE!), baking yeast and a slight tartness. Subdued bitterness. Unlike in the normal Debauched the Brett has really built up wonderfully here, but the flavour is a bit of a let down after the very promising aroma. 170212","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"
2561,"2012-02-17",3.7,"Draft. A hazy golden beer with a thin lazing white head. The aroma has notes of brettanomyces, wood, wine, alcohol, and citrus fruits. The flavor is sweet with notes of grapes, brettanomyces, alcohol, over ripe fruis, juniper, and wood, leading to a tart and dry finish.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"

Funky, with a big heap of earthy brett.  Long brett and funk.  Wheat, with light malty backbone.  Softly floral and herbal notes accompany spicy acid on the finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
