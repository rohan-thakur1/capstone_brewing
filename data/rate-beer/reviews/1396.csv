1396,"2016-11-23",3.1,"Aroma - syrupy kind of malt, a little toast, a touch of roast, and some birch like quality.
Appearance - the body is a clean dark amber, with good nucleation. The head is 2"" and beige, and settles into a layer of filmy suds.
Taste - has a kind, slightly sweet syrupy malt. There is a slight toast and roast about the malt. There is a small hint of birch oil or sassafras, doubtful its in the batch, but it has that quality in place.
Palate - medium body, texture is velvety, the carbonation is average, the finish is slightly tannic.","Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, USA","DandyWolfFloyd"
1396,"2016-11-13",3.0,"Though with a slightly muted nose, the flavors are good, especially early on, when the maltiness stretches as far as caramel and chocolate, and it rounds into a solid breadiness. But the appearance signaled that it might be a bit flat (some early carbonation) and indeed, the palate just limped home rather disappointingly. O.k. enough in some ways, but nothing to recommend.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

1396,"2013-03-08",3.7,"Pours a deep reddish brown with a good long lasting head and nice lacing on the glass. 

The aroma is richly malty, very nutty, and lightly roasty. The beer is not overly sweet smelling and really very inviting. 

The flavor is nutty and not especially sweet but well within the sweetness level of the style, Im so used to Dunkel being on the edge of annoyingly sweet, and theyre many times really wonderful beers if they dont enter that territory, this one is on the drier side... so more to my taste for sure. There are some nice chocolate and roasty notes with most of the bitterness coming from a light herbal hoppiness. Very clean tasting, very well executed. 

Hopefully the style designation on this will get ironed out as this is not a  Dunkelweizen at all.... The commercial description tags it specifically as a Dunkel, which is what it is... and its a damn fine one at that.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

1396,"2013-01-16",3.5,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a clear, deep brown-amber colored body with a finger-width, creamy and frothy, light tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is nutty toffees with a light sweetness, some caramels, touches of toast, and a light herbal grass. Flavor is similar. Smooth, nutty toffees and caramels with a light sweetness up front before a touch of toast comes in with just a slight fruit note. Finishes clean and dry with a light grassy bitterness and a nice, clean malt backing. Fairly lengthy aftertaste following a smooth, medium body and a soft, moderate carbonation. Overall, a basic, but pretty well done Dunkel. Smooth, lightly sweetened malts with a touch of toast and a clean grassy bitterness. Very easy drinking. Nice beer.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
