2206,"2016-10-22",3.7,"Pours copper-amber with a one finger off white head with nice lacing. Aroma is of toasted bready malts, caramel, light grassy hops, some sweet malts, and toffee. Taste is similar the aroma with the addition of some sweet potato notes. Has a medium body with a semi creamy mouthfeel and a mostly sweet, medium finish. Overall, a very solid oktoberfest with a very unique flavor for the style.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","skmikeg"
2206,"2016-01-01",3.9,"Its pretty much what it says on the label, its a malty festbier with a hint of noticeably tuberish sweetness. Very solid beer.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"

2206,"2015-10-19",3.3,"On tap at Fermentaria. Poured a orangish amber color with a smaller sized head. Bread, caramel, and sweet potatoes. Not my favorite style, but not that bad too ...","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
2206,"2015-10-07",3.3,"Draft at Monks. Hazy orange amber. Soapy off-white head. Splashes of wet lace. Sweet potato Marzen. Bready caramel malts. Quite juicy for an Oktoberfest. Toasted Challah. Sage. Clove. Cinnamon. Lemongrass. Nice.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","NikkTwist"

The taste is sweet potato, apple, spice, caramel. Medium bodied, mild lingering bitterness, creamy. Nice.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Drake"

2206,"2014-10-12",3.7,"Draft. Orange pour with tan head. Light malty and other frut/veg aromas. Solid octoberfest with sweet potatoes.","Wayne, New Jersey, USA","vtafro"
2206,"2014-06-23",3.1,"On tap at Tired Hands.
Appearance: Light haze in the light copper body. Dense white head that dissipates into a thin coating.
Aroma: Mild aroma, hints of sweet malts and mild earthiness.
Taste: Mild intro that builds by the finish. Malty with some caramel, hints of overlying floral and toast notes. Lingers of toast.
Palate: Full-bodied, slimy texture, moderately carbonated.
Overall: Not a fan of this. The finish lingers and Im not fond of it.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"
2206,"2013-10-14",3.5,"on draft at brewery, oof, yup, a sweet potato oktoberfest. Add in a yam like sweetness to a sweetish beer. A for effort not for taste.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
2206,"2013-10-10",3.2,"Draft at the source, pours hazy golden copper with small non-lasting head but solid looking lace. Aromas and flavor of milk chocolate malt, bread, grain, vanilla bean, and vegetables. This one was a malt bomb and reaffirmed my strong dislike of German brews. Medium to full body with lighter carbonation.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
2206,"2013-10-07",3.5,"On tap at Tired Hands. Clear golden brown with a whitish head. Nose is toffee and slight sweet potato. Medium body with a tang finishing dry. Taste is caramel, pecan, green grass, yam and vanilla. The yam is a natural pairing with the Märzen; spices not required.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
2206,"2013-10-03",3.6,"Draft at the brewpub. Pours a hazy amber with medium beige head and some lace. Nose of bread, caramel, nut. Medium body with and nearly viscous, creamy mouthfeel. Sweet and malty with decent bitterness on the finish.","Pennsylvania, USA","tcane7"
2206,"2012-09-30",3.3,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2013 Medium orange-amber body, moderate off-white head, spotty lacing.  The nose smells a bit like a puff-pastry, with some bready malts and a little vegetal-earthy character.  Flavor is similar and ads a little more depth.  Not sure what I get is sweet potato, but there is some earthy-sweet malt here.  Medium bodied, mellow carbonation, light sweetness throughout the finish.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
2206,"2012-09-30",3.3,"Draft at the brewery with Ann, Pat and James. Pours a clear caramel with a white head. No aroma to speak of. Flavor is slightly burnt caramel with some rooty vegetal flavors. Very thin, flavor is subdued.","Ambler, Pennsylvania, USA","DeputyAndy"
2206,"2012-09-29",3.7,"Pours a orange, slightly hazy, white head with tight bubbles. Aroma is sweet, honey, bready, crackers, caramel. Taste is potatoskins, earthy, malty, toast, nice earthy hops. A more interesting oktoberfest offer than most other breweries for sure!","Linköping, SWEDEN","Tinco"
2206,"2012-09-29",3.6,"I was corrected twice about that name of this. Not uber, but tuber because of the yams- which played a minor role in the flavor. Starts very marzen like. I was told this wasnt at all like a marzen- cept it was. Bready, biscuit, toasted malts, earthy. Finishes much the same with just a light sweetness that probably comes from the sweet potato. Enjoyable. (Not sure why they were so against it being thought of as an Oktoberfest. that is exactly what it is)","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
2206,"2012-09-29",3.4,"Draft at tired hands with Dallas, Ann, and pat.  Pours a deep hazy amber with nice white lacing. Aroma is nothing, light malt. Mouthfeel is smooth medium to thin with notes of sweet, toasted malt. Very bland, but very well executed.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
2206,"2012-09-26",4.1,"Pours unclear orange amber with a creamy white head and fantastic lacing. The aroma brings sweet notes of the sweet potato, but not necessarilly aroma of the potato itself, a bit more citrusy. The flavor is similar, sweet orange notes on a velvety body bigger than any other beer of the same style that I have sampled. Some earthy bitter notes are on the backend as well.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
2206,"2012-09-23",3.0,"Tap at Tired Hands. Muddy opaque dark dark orange pour. Webby lace. Nose is pumpkin pie crust and heavy rustic grain. Cheese and nuts. Taste is lighter, small pumpkin, sugar, a bit of apple juice. Palate is bitter and a bit thin. Some small oil. A bit papery.

2206,"2012-09-22",4.1,"Pours a hazy orange/lt amber (just transferred though so i think it will clear up a good bit) with a creamy meidum white head...great lacing and retention.  Aroma has light caramel and toasty malts, dry leaves, and nice floral hoppiness...a bit like a harvest ale!  Flavor follows suit...just a touch of faint yeasty spice...nice sweet roast and great fresh floral hoppiness for balance.  Mouthfeel is medium/full and the finish is lightly hoppy/autumnal and dry.  Awesome!","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"
