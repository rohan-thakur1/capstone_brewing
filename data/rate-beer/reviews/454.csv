En bouche, le corps du liquide est bien structuré. La texture est veloutée et le pétillement contribue à la belle diffusion des saveurs.

Incredibly dimensional and forceful, especially for the ABV. Creamy thick body, soft carb. Sweet chocolate and bourbon up front, no habanero until the tingle at the finish.

After sampling the base stout I have to say that the barrel aging only really accentuates the spices and heat from the habaneros. The coffee bean is more noticeable in this version then the base stout. The barrel treatment is not really noticeable here but the spice sure come through! The warming after the sip is not from alcohol but rather the pepper. Mild traces of vanilla. Soft carbonation with a fuller body ton of flavor for a 6% stout! really damn nice.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

454,"2014-05-11",4.3,"From notes. 12 oz bottle shared at a tasting on 5 May. The pour is black with a dark khaki head and pretty much no lace here. The aroma is incredibly spicy. The nutmeg dominates on the front end and the cinnamon and pepper roll nicely through the middle with a light roasty character. The coffee isnt really present in the nose. The dominance is in the spices and not the pepper. The flavor is really good. The heat takes a back seat to the spices and allows them to meld with the coffee. The bourbon doesnt have a strong presence, but rather just adds a nice vanilla character and non-habanero related heat profile. Its really well done. The mouth feel is a touch thin, but there is a good carbonation that helps it feel a little thicker. The aftertaste is warm, spicy, and dry, lingering beautifully","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

454,"2014-04-17",4.1,"$3 single poured into Sam Adams Perfect Pint.

Appearance: Pours pitch black with a tan head than goes away quickly. Basically zero lacing. Looks decent. (3.5/5)

Smell: A lot like I remember the original smelling like, really, but a bit better. Quite a lot of cinnamon and nutmeg, but a lot of chocolate as well. Bits of coffee. I suppose theres a vanilla note as well, but the barrel isnt exactly obvious on the nose. (4.25/5)

Taste/feel: Better than the original Mayan Mocha, but not by a huge margin. What the barrels did to make this brew better was they made the habaneros a bit less hot, and added a soothing vanilla sort of flavor. COMPLEX. Cinnamon, nutmeg, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, a *slight* touch of habanero heat, and also a spruce tip sort of flavor as well. As it warms, a butterscotch aroma comes through. A peanut flavor on the aftertaste. Really just an insane sort of complexity for a 6% beer. I cant think of many beers that have a laundry list of flavors and aromas like this one. Mouth feel is a bummer, as BBAMM is much too thin. Carbonation is about medium. Nice overall. (4.25/5, 3.25/5)

I like the bourbon barrel version a good amount more than the original. It was 70 cents more, but thats nothing. Id definitely get this beer again, I just wish the feel was better.

454,"2014-02-11",3.9,"Bottle. I definitely liked this better than the non aged version. Heavy nutmeg but the vanilla notes from the bourbon temper the cinnamon. Enjoyable beer.","Michigan, USA","RespertFTW"

454,"2014-02-09",4.1,"UPDATED: NOV 13, 2014 Bottle: I originally had this on tap at HopCat last year... I liked it then, but I like it even more now. Review from the fresh bottle. Super dark pour, only the smallest hint of brown at the edges, topped with a foamy, light-tan cap that slowly settles to a collar. Aroma is super complex, lots of wonderful things going on. Bakers chocolate covered Cinnamon Toast Crunch with undercurrents wood, holiday spice, tingly pepper, & very timid bourbon. Vanilla graham crackers & the slightest hint of roasted coffee. The taste isnt as riveting as the nose, but its still pretty damn good & plenty complex. Lovely bittersweet chocolate up front, followed by notes of graham cracker, cinnamon bread, vanilla, wood, coffee grounds, clove & nutmeg, & a kick from the chilies in the finish. On tap, I thought this beer was a little too hot from the peppers... The heat is perfect here. Just a little chili flavor & a back-throat tingle lasting in the aftertaste.  This much aroma/flavor in a 6% ABV stout is already crazy... Slightly thin body, but at 6% ABV its hard to complain. The fact that this is 10$ for a 4-pack is even better. Super awesome beer.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
454,"2014-02-09",3.7,"Not as good as the non barrel aged version. Lots of chocolate and barely any bourbon.","Michigan, USA","HisBoyElroy"
454,"2014-02-09",4.0,"Black pour with thick tan head that dissipates. Big aroma of cinnamon, spices, and nutmeg. Taste is cinnamon, spice, coffee and chocolate with a slight bourbony hint. Pretty good stuff.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","fattybladdy"
454,"2014-02-08",3.7,"A big milk chocolate smell. The milk chocolate definitely carries over to the taste. The spice makes it appearance at the back end of the sip. Flavor dissipates quick and the spicy sticks around. Main flavors definitely being the milk chocolate, peppery spice, and a slight booziness. I think it would be better if it were balanced with a bit more chocolate and maybe a thicker more stout feel.","Michigan, USA","SpongeRuiner"
454,"2014-02-06",3.5,"Bottle. Near black with the dark tan head. Dark caramel and chocolate with lots of cinnamon. Getting a smooth texture and mouth feel from the barrel aging but not getting much bourbon.","Michigan, USA","Mittenator"
454,"2014-02-06",4.1,"Bottle. The pour is black with a little over carbonation. The aroma is more heat than bourbon, a nice mixture of heat, chocolate, and some spices. The taste is pretty much a perfect blend. The heat and bourbon are both hidden by each other in a good way. Coffee and chocolate also play out well. Only compliant is a little thin overall.

454,"2014-02-05",4.2,"Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate chocolate, cinnamon,vanilla, light nutmeg, and some faint pepper heat (it tastes more chili than habanero to me). There is some bourbon there if you search for it, but for the most part its buried behind all the chocolate, cinnamon, and vanilla. As it warms, the bourbon notes get a little stronger, but theyre still relatively mild. This really smells outstanding. It pours a dark brown with no transparency and a slight orange glow around the edges of the glass. It has a small and somewhat fizzy beige head that quickly fades to a very fine ring around the edges of the glass. The flavor starts with a moderate chocolate and light vanilla. The vanilla builds into the finish and mixes with light-moderate cinnamon, nutmeg, some light pepper heat that leaves a slight tingle on the tongue/back of the throat, and a touch of coffee The bourbon is there too, but like the aroma its very mild. It really mixes well and compliments the vanilla/spice/heat combo in the finish. Its medium bodied with carbonation thats a little more fizzy than I like in a Stout. Overall, a really nice barrel aged beer as the base beer still really shines through while the bourbon barrel adds a nice compliment.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
454,"2013-08-02",4.1,"Draft sample at MBGSF 2013. Poured dark brown color with an average frothy off-white head that mostly lasted with excellent lacing. Moderate to heavy toasted malt, hot spice and vanilla wood aroma. Medium to full body and a sticky texture and soft carbonation. Medium to heavy spice and vanilla wood sweet flavor with a medium to heavy sweet spice finish of moderate to long duration. Much better complex version of this beer.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
454,"2013-07-30",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2014 Sampled at the 2013 MBG Summer Festival. Awesome aroma, sweet iced mocha, cinnamon, nutmeg, oak, and vanilla. Taste has a stronger oak and bourbon presence than the aroma suggests. The base beer still comes through nicely though with the iced mocha and spices. Awesome mild chili pepper finish. Thin to medium body. Definitely one of my favorites of the day.

Re-rate from bottle 2/7/14 - This is different in the bottle than I remember from the sample I had on draft.  This stuff is awesome.  Big vanilla and oak flavor but the great iced mocha still comes through perfectly.  No booziness at all.  Still a little thin but this goes down easier than any BB beer Ive had.  So smooth, flavorful and easy to drink.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
454,"2013-07-22",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2014 Tap. Pours black with soft tan head. Big spicy vanilla nose. Taste is smooth thick spiced chocolate with a vanilla kiss damn good. (re rate from bottle)

pours black medium body with sexy tan head. big aroma of spice/vanilla and some chili heat. taste is lots of milky vanilla and slight slight oak. heat is hidden and i cant belive this is a low abv. If the body was thicker this would be a perfect 5","bloomfield, Michigan, USA","mikem409"
454,"2013-07-18",4.0,"Draft to taster at Odd Side. All barreled Mayan Mocha varietals have been bourbon barreled thus far, and this one used Woodford Reserve barrels. Looks good; a dark cola with thin beige lacing. Smells good too; dark malt, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, cinnamon, and pepper spice. Tastes like it smells with a nice, smooth mouthfeel. Good beer!","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
454,"2013-05-27",4.3,"Glass at Hop Cat on 3/29/13. Black pour with a medium tan head. Aroma of sweet chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and some roast. Malty and chocolatey flavor with cinnamon and pepper accents before a roasty finish. Very nice.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
454,"2013-02-26",4.3,"Caramel & bourbon on the nose.  Awesome flavor; even with a good amount of bourbon and pepper, its still smooth & creamy.  A touch less viscosity than Id like, but this beer greatly represent Odd Sides strength: light, thin, and somehow very flavorful stouts.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","gonzosauce"
