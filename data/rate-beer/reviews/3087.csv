3087,"2014-09-27",4.2,"""A big deal when it arrived in Reno a few weeks ago. I thought id missed my chance but found a bottle still on the shelf just the other day. Tried it that night. Immediate nostril-pleasing aroma of woodsy smoke. Upon further nose digging, some roast and choclate as well. Flavor adds a bit of bittering hops and the smoke aspect is done incredibly well here. Not subtle in the least, but not overblown either. Body and flavor are akin to an imperial porter-type ale. very very nice, if a little steep in price. Lou, youd love this!""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

3087,"2012-12-19",3.9,"Had on tap. 

Arrived a hazy dark brown with a thick tan head that seemed to last forever.

Aroma of lots of smoke along with bacon. Really smelled like a campfire that someone had thrown bacon on. There was some fruit coming through as well adding another element to the smoke.

The flavor was not as heavy on the smoke as I was expecting. Lots of caramel along with bacon nicely complimenting the smokiness. A nice fruit element as well lending a nice balance to everything. I kind of wish the smoke would have been a little more prominent.

Overall, a nice take on a smoked beer. I like the fruit and hop elements making this beer just a little bit different.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"
3087,"2012-12-06",3.8,"On draft at Churchkey in D.C.

The beer is chestnut brown with a filmy, khaki colored head. The head settles and holds around 1/8"" for the duration. The aroma is smoke, campfire, bacon, char. Very nice - a pleasure to inhale. As expected, a lot of smoke in the flavor. A pretty straightforward beer. The feel is thick, oily, and coats the palate. I enjoyed this and would certainly have it again.

The flavor is really quite a battle between the piney hops and the rauch malt up front, with a little Marzen like sweetness coming out towards the finish.

3087,"2012-02-08",4.2,"THOUGHTS: Wow. Very smokey. As smokey as a true German smoked. Plenty of pine, too. Hid alcohol fairly well. This takes smoked to another level with all of the hops. Probably the best smoked Ive had that wasnt from Germany. Definitely interesting. Incredible idea and great execution.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a medium to dark, reddish brown with an average, beige head that kept a thin sheet and left good lacing. The aroma had moderate molasses and caramel; heavy pine and resin hops; lighter citrus hops; smoke; toffee; brown sugar; the slightest hint of vinegar; barbecue sauce; and bacon. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and light to mod bitter; while the finish was mod to heavily sweet; ever so slightly sour and moderately bitter with a long duration. There was caramel, toffee, barbecue sauce, bacon, brown sugar, piney hops, come citrus hops, hints of chocolate, and some resinous hops.

Pours a very dark brown thats almost black with faint mahogany edges when held to a light source and a one finger light beige head. Decent retention only slowly fading into a lasting ring that leaves steaks and spots of lace behind.

Interesting aroma thats part smokey and part hoppy. Not nearly as smokey as I had hoped for unfortunately with subtle hints of charcoal, wood and BBQ. Theres some roasted dark malt notes but they arent burnt smelling along with some grassy pine. As it warms the smoke becomes more prominent but overall the nose is a bit of a disappointment for me.

Chewy full body with a blast of earthy hops that overpower the smoked malt notes and linger over the roasted body into a dry finish. Dry and bitter with hints of grass and pine along with subtle citrus fruit character. Underneath, the malt backbone is somewhat smokey but unfortunately this flavor is outshined by the bitterness. Faint smoked/roasted malt with hints of roast, dark chocolate, BBQ and ash. The smoke is most prominent in the finish but its kind of an afterthought. I wanted a smoke bomb but I got a hop overload.
