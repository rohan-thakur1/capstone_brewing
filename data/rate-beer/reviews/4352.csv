4352,"2013-04-03",3.7,"500ml bottle bought at CitySuper at New Town Plaza, Shatin;
Clear deep brownish red colour;  Explosive two and a half finger head and light beige foam which lasted for 2 minutes; Very good sticky lacing and notable carbonation; Very fragrant aroma of sweet malt, coffee, dark chocolate, toffee and hint of dark fruits. The coffee aroma can be smelt half a foot away from glass once poured; Light sweet taste of dark malt, with light coffee, strong nuts, burnt toast, light citrus and sharp grass; Mid to light body with crisp and quite oily palate, Taste profile reminiscent of a strongly hopped Dunkel, sweetness is near zero, coffee and toast like character fully wrapped in a very nutty, hoppy background. Hoppiness is expressive and nicely offset any remaining sweetness. Bitterness is mild and lasting astringency can be felt as a finish. Quite dry after taste, fairly easy to mouth.

Comments: I was expecting a red-fruit style English Ale, so I am genuinely surprised by its Brown Ale / Dunkel like character. I like it more with further sips, and my ideal Dunkel should taste like this brew: dark maltyness without sugary taste, light coffee character, strong nuttiness, and expressive but not domineering hoppiness. If you have one bad Dunkel / Dark Ale memory too many like me, then this one will help you wipe the slate clean. Worth having it again.","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"
4352,"2013-04-02",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2015 Served in a snifter, this Brown Ale pours a clear mahogany with a mostly short-lived tan head that manages to leave decent, spotty lacing. 

The rich aroma [8.5] is very appealing and promising, wit ample notes of dark fruits, toffee and roasted nuts. Hints of apples and woody hops. 

Taste: not what I expected from the nose.  The flavor is more malty with a darker roast and some burnt notes.  Bittersweet, with the bitterness dominating almost from the outset and leaving what I though was a slightly too bitter aftertaste. Those other aromas do appear, and include burnt toffee, toast, caramel, apples, a touch of smoke, dates and other vague dark fruits.  There are some earthy hop flavors in addition to the bitterness. 

M: medium-full body; very slightly astringent; medium carbonation.

O: Despite the comic marketing on the label, this is a serious beer worth seeking out if you like English style Brown Ales.

The sweetness changes from honey-sweet to a wide, open and mild chocolate sweetness. this dances with the bitterness that is mild but nicely uplifts the malt. The sourness is gentle but not weak; its lifts up its head nicely when you seem to forget it was there. The palate makes this work even better by having a medium body with a surprisingly thick, oily texture. the carbonation is spot on, keeping things alive but not overwhelming anything.

Flavour is quite malty and not as sweet, has notes of dark chocolate, cherries, cloves, anise and malt. Smooth, almost oily, mouthfeel with minimal carbonation and a fairly bitter finish.

4352,"2009-11-21",3.6,"THOUGHTS: It might have been a little skunked or at least a little past its prime. Not as flavorful as most old ales. A little thin too. Probably not skunked. Not the best old ale, but a nice beer.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, light to medium brown with dark amber highlights and an average to large, creamy, tan head that mostly diminished and left good lacing. The aroma was moderate to heavy dark bread and caramel malt; slight milk chocolate; light herbal hops; light to moderate earthy yeast; banana, a little sour fruit; and sugar water. The initial flavor was rather sweet, slightly sour and a little bitter; while the finish was sour and a little bitter with an average to long duration. There was caramel malt, a little maple syrup, fruit, yeast, metallic hops, sugar water, and a little herbal hops. It would have been cloying if not for the dry bitter finish. Nice balance. The nearly medium body was fairly oily and then dry with soft yet tingly carbonation and a moderate to heavily astringent and slightly chalky finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"
4352,"2009-11-16",3.4,"Creamy, tan head that is a little oily.  The retention was surprisingly short.  Beautiful mahogany color.

Aromas is a sweet malt.  On the initial taste, the malts were not as pronouced as expected, however the mid-palate carried strong, dark malts and dried raisins.  A lot going on in this beer through the mid-palate.

Bitterness really comes through on the finish, although the finish left quickly, leaving sweet tar flavor on the lips, and a tingly, viscous feeling.

Because of its style and origin, i would serve this with a hearty beef stew.","Redwood City, California, USA","Zymurgeist2"

Appearance: Brown with garnet highlights.  Foamy, light tan head.  Decent lacing left behind.

Palate: Smooth, medium-low carbonation with a medium mouthfeel.  Long, bitter and roasty finish.  This one had odd aftertaste that seemed to stick to my mouth.  Not exactly pleasant.

4352,"2009-08-18",3.4,"Bottle shared with funkybrewster.  Pours a glowing dark very rich red, but absolutely clear, with a tall thin airy foamy light beige froth.  Aroma is a mix of sweet and fruity and dark and roasty, some light butter, rich roasted coffee and chocolate.  Flavor leads with a nice alcohol and bitter combination smoothing into a glassy sweetness with subtle fruit and some light butter, finishes with an odd combo of bitter coffee, roasted malt and sweet fruits.  Rich and very bitter.  Seems like the bitterness is mostly attributed to the hard roasted malt even though there is a definite hop bite left in the the aftertaste.  Medium bodied, very smooth, glassy, softer sizzling carbonation adding some fluffiness.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","17thfloor"

Really strong dark roasted malts, nice character of raisins hiding behind a slight coffee and toast note. Flavor starts with a bit dark roasted malt, again some coffee beans and dark fruits provide a soft sweetness. Finishes with a much more aggressive bitterness and peppery quality that completely opposes the soft sweet middle. Medium body and a soft carbonation. Interesting old ale, very much based around those roasted malts rather than the dark fruits.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","FunkyBrewster"

4352,"2009-07-15",3.5,"Excellent first impressions on taste and aroma. Poured out a very nice looking crystal clear deep mahogany beer with a small white cap that leaves a bit of ropy lacing. There is still lots to love for aroma here but after letting it breathe for 10 minutes much of the early charm has hidden itself. Well defined roasted malts and nuts are the most forward but now its quickly joined by something that is reminiscent of sweat and corn. OK, Ive left it for 10 minutes more and things are slowly returning to Happyland. Background coffee, some fruit that seems to be raspberry in nature. I actually think the aromas I though sucked are actually tobacco related and now I accept it. The taste is still pretty fine though: good roast balanced nicely with perfectly strengthed bitterness, slight slight coffee, corn husks, interesting spice that comes out later, mild caramel. Well carbonated, good bitter finish with lingering dull malts. A lot of these would be nice. I did get bored after awhile though...","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

4352,"2009-06-13",3.3,"Another bottle of beer my Dad left at my house after his most recent visit.  And this one is....nice.  5.7% ABV is not an ABV appropriate for an old ale; to my mind this beer is more like a nice Bitter or maybe a really mild Scottish Ale.  Malty, coppery, with a touch of hop.

Color is dark, and head was plentiful at first but faded quickly.  Aroma was coppery maltiness, toffee-ish malt, and some light coffee roastiness.  Flavor is more of the same, and is pretty good.  This beer is a really nice balance of taste and drinkability, but the flavor, while pleasant, is mild and that mildness is a strike against it from my perspective.  Mouthfeel is substantial.

I liked this beer.  It isnt the RIS, DIPA, Tripel, Berlinerweisse, Flemish Sour or other big-flavor-packing style I usually favor, but it is still good.

However, then I finished it and really really wanted another, yet I couldnt explain why. Its dangerously drinkable for a beer of this strength.  

[18/1/2012 - re-rate, 500ml bottle from Maureen & Dave - cheers!] This was one of my very early rates, so I was glad to be given the opportunity to re-rate it (especially given the disparity between my low original rating and the site average).  It pours a chestnut brown with a moderate creamy head and fizz clinging to the sides of the glass.  As the appearance suggests, it is a little too fizzy in the mouth for the style.  Theres a vinous hint in the initial taste, followed by a little chocolate, but the whole thing is pervaded by the bitter metallic taste of over-enthusiastic pasteurisation.  A little dryness in the finish, but also a bit sticky. Still didnt like it, and this time I really didnt want another one.","Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","wheresthepath"

The taste is complex, and very nice. There are strong bitter hop flavors from the start. Im sure this isnt barell aged, becuase generally breweries boast that from the start, but there is a fantasic oaky flavor in this beer. Notes of coffee, cherries, and dried fruit follow through to the back of the tongue. For all of its flavor this beer is well rounded, but in no way is does it have a ""huge"" flavor, it would be very nice as a session beer.

The taste is a little earthy, chocolaty, caramelly malt, coffee, all mild, and toasty (not burnt), and some flowery, bitter hop character.  It is smooth with a sweet and bitter finish.  Its lively, complex, smooth, and tasty.","California, USA","Wulfstan"

Lace is very sticky and leaves a fragile pattern about an inch up the side.  ""Racing"" is deep, thick and slow.  Smell: piney hops sting, dark grains, butter, sweaty socks, steamy bathroom, and dust; a weird blend of appetizing with not-so-much.  Mouthfeel is very creamy, especially in the finish, which is buttery, bready, slightly banana and softly sweet (like lactose) over an incredibly subtle dry hoppiness that is mostly minty in character (with some ""stale"" coffee grounds in there, although better than that sounds); it lingers on the sides of the tongue after the bready flavor is gone.  Before the finish, the beer is a bit watery and the hops are metallic and thin; the malts lack character, lending only a flaccid sweetness in addition to their straightforward creamy, buttery banana taste.

Begins with a slightly creamy, slightly fluffy mouthfeel, gaining malt flavor as the medium body sets in.  Light fruit flavors of cherries and light milk chocolate make themselves known.  Finish gains some bitterness, and a touch of lemon merengue even.  Some brown sugar and a hint of roast are present on the very end and aftertaste.  Lightly astringent with a touch of thinning, but very clean and just sweet enough to be balanced.  The longer it warms, and the slower I drink it, as usual per the style, the more I get out of it.

4352,"2003-01-18",3.6,"great packaging, tho the name ""riggwelter"", which means something like a lame, retarded or palsied sheep, probably wouldn't occur to me as a great name for a good beer.  it's a ruddy chestnut color, like a drake cinnamon teal; a pug colored head is dwarfish but gets protective and swells when the beer is aggitated.  a big aroma of raw leathery malts and shoe polish, pumpkin-vanilla-caramels, wheat bread and alcohol.  whispering carbonation veils none of the choice bitters, as butterscotch coffee aspects, fortified with a hickory-lemon tart and tinny twang routs a mousy sweetness.  medium bodied, dry.  like a great lakes burning river with a british accent.  there's nothing lame about this old goat, tho it's too pricey to qualify as a great session ale.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

4352,"2002-12-20",4.0,"Bottle. Fine, beige head. This is an ebony, black coffee to amber colored ale. Syrupy 
aroma which reminds
me of brittle choclate & coffee cookies I had a while back. A snarling and barky ale, yet all smooth drinking with the proper glass. Avoid the nonick pint-glass and go for a 
snifter with a fat gut. Drinking with a snifter has, for me, taken away any tart aftertaste.
Drink on
an empty stomach while cooking and feel the blunt, pounding blow that gives right to the
monicker, ""Riggwelter"".
Not the Laphroaig of ales, but a good Friday-beer. A drink for decadents, swine and warriors.

I split this with friends and they all enjoyed it as much as I did.  One said it tasted nutty to him. I thought at times it was almost grassy or hay like.","Brantford, Ontario, CANADA","Cartoonkhaki"
4352,"2002-12-08",4.0,"I kind of like these English Strong Ales. I believe the last one I had was Coniston Old Man in Toronto with the First RB convention crew. This is quite similar...damn near smacks of those high-backed English chairs in red leather with the buttons in the upholstery, leather bound books in a musty, earthy library with some old guy (like Q [RIP] from the old Bond films) as the librarian. A small smoky fire crackles in the corner and it is humid and slightly cold, and youve got this concoction to keep you warm.

4352,"2002-10-29",3.5,"UPDATED: APR 8, 2009 Oct, 2002 Brewed by Paul Theakston, the black sheep of the Theakston brewing family, in the old Lightfoots brewery that the Theakston family had bought up and closed down many years earlier. Black Sheep beers are bold and uncompromising. 
This is a good dark brew. It has some of the dark twisted rooty taste of a stout, but with the sour fruit tang of a porter. A good old fashioned English ale. There is an interesting hop bitterness dancing around on an ever elusive malt body. There are chopped mixed nuts - some hazlenuts, some walnuts, some pecan - and assorted fruits - banana, fresh apple, grapes. There is toffee, caramel, licorice, some herbs and spices. There is enough going on to keep up interest to the end. And all this in a surprisingly refreshing body. The strength can quickly catch up with you - no wonder that damn sheep is rolling around cheerfully drunk! [3.4]

April, 2003 Compared with Bombardier. Dark hazelnut colour. Broken, thin, clinging nicotine cream head. Sweat yeast aroma - wet leather with a hint of cabbage and some creamy toffee. Quite complex and yielding. Stout like, roasty malt - burnt fruit cake. Fairly consistent, though occasionally a vanilla tone comes through. A dark, almost devilish beer - leaning in the roasty direction of a stout.  The strong dark flavours stand up well to the pasteurisation process.[3.5]
Dec, 2006 Blind tasting with Old Peculier, Strong Sufolk and ESB. 2nd place. Dark amber colour. Frothy carbonation - some long lasting cappuccino foam. Aroma is fridge ice, vanilla, coffee, roasted barley, rubbery plastic, raspberry jam and nappies. Noticeable bitterness - lingering after the finish. Roasted barley and English hops. Burnt chocolate. The bitterness makes this stand out. A tasty, strong English ale. [3.2]
