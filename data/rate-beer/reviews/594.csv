594,"2017-03-07",3.8,"I honestly hate this style as you get so much clove and banana out of many versions. That does not exist here very much. More malty and carbonated. very sweet malty light tropical notes. Thin heads that disappears.","Taft, Tennessee, USA","Itzjerm"
594,"2015-10-08",3.3,"Light, clear bronze. Belgian pale ale aroma - funky, candied. Tannic, sweet, mossy, lightly astringent. Between a pale and a dubbel. Slightly light body, banana esters. On tap, Rick Tanners.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","Aurelius"
594,"2015-04-12",3.8,"On tap. 
A well crafted dubbel that is on par with a good Belgian. 
Lacks the overly fruity or off tastes I find all too often in the aftertaste of dubbels.","South Carolina, USA","chinchill"
594,"2014-07-12",3.5,"Poured an amber color with aromas of bread, toast, malt, toffee and caramel. Flavors are the same malt and toffee with light caramel. Decent double overall, thanks John for bringing this growler back from Hotlanta.","Florida, USA","burg326"
594,"2013-09-22",4.0,"Draft. Murky amber brown color, large tan ice cream cone head. Aroma of lightly toasted brown bread. Taste is full bodied sweet brown bread with caramel, light toffee, burnt edges. Nice mouthfeel. Good stuff.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
594,"2013-08-07",4.3,"Tap at Cherry Street. Amber color. Well, tastes perfect. Very dry. Flavors of plum, current, raisin, and toasted grain. Smells of caramel malt and raisins. Very well done. One of the best Belgian Dubbels Ive had in awhile. (3782)","Georgia, USA","unclemattie"
594,"2013-06-08",4.4,"Pours an opaque cinnamon brown with a nice light tan head. Rich aroma has malty, caramel and banana notes. Malty flavor has banana, hoppy, caramel, and subtle woody tones, while the firm and fizzy texture rounds out a very pleasant beer-drinking experience. I hope that Cherry Street succeeds big time.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
594,"2013-04-23",3.3,"Draft.  Pours a almost clear amber with off thin white head.  Smell is fruity, spicy and sweet caramel.  Taste is lightly spicey, clove, get minor hints of banana, caramel, belgian yeast, sweet sugar residue, fruity.  Overall, pretty nice attempt  but perhaps lacks a bit of something to take it from being average.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","Westmeister"
594,"2013-04-11",3.5,"UPDATED: NOV 29, 2013 On tap at Rick Tanners. Brown, with a small, tan head. Dark fruits, caramel, oak, and vanilla. Very sweet flavor throughout. Light to medium body, silky, and a little thin. Overall, a fair attempt at a dubbel, but the flavor is too sweet, and the aroma lacks depth. Still, a good beer. 

On tap at the Georgia Pine. The lacing on the glass is thick. The aroma is interesting, but not terribly appealing. Currants, plums, and some anise combine to make a tar-like aroma that doesnt exactly draw you in. As it warms that aroma becomes more pleasant. Later into the drink, the candi sugar and yeasty notes of ripe bananas and bread dough come forward, turning this into a much more approachable and lovely beer. This is a good example of an American Dubbel, but still doesnt compare to the real thing.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","GTAEgeek"
594,"2013-04-08",3.4,"Appearance: Presents a delicately hazed, amber-tan body in color, with a slim, white head.

Smell: A scent of bready malts, a bit toasty, too, affixed to notes of cooked sugars, dried fruits, light spice, and soft alcohol wafts.

Taste: Bready malts, with a slight toasted grain quality to it. Taste of dark sugars, fairly sweet. The tangy currants are noted, playing alongside the yeast esters and alcohol, with additional hints of raisin and banana. Spicy phenolics giving a bit of green peppercorn. Minimal hop character and bitterness. Semi-dry, spicy, lightly warming finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.

Overall: Falls middle-of-the-road for me.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
