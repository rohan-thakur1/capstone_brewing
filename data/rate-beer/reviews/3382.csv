3382,"2015-04-26",3.7,"One of the beers with which this brewery is now resurrected and likely the first ISA in Belgium; I do find the name ""double session IPA"" a bit confusing, but according to the brewer, the ""double"" merely relates to the hops dosage. Sticky, yellowish white, creamy and very stable head, yellowish blonde colour, misty; aroma of tangelo, lemon zest, apple, white grape peel, tonic water, hay. Lightly sweetish onset, vividly fruity, rounded and supple, crisp and quenching, with a long, spicy and restrainedly citrussy hop bitter finish. Very refreshing, no off-flavours, this clearly has been thought out well, and acted out with care and knowledge.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
