2578,"2016-07-27",3.4,"The Scandinavian beer revolution does not neglect its own traditions, and many of these new craft breweries there come up with recreations of ancient Nordic ales regularly. This is one such example, though, as with the stories surrounding saison, I find it hard to imagine that a 6.5% ABV beer (or originally even 7%) would serve as a thirst quencher for landworkers during harvest, as the label claims... Thinnish, bubbly, off-white, regular head leaving a rim around the edge and some thin patches in the middle but eventually dissolving into completely nothing; almost clear amberish orange colour with a suspension of tiny yeast bits throughout, becoming a completely cloudy amber with sediment. Aroma of (mildly) smoked bacon, dried orange peel and bitter orange, freshly grated ginger, dried juniper berries, roasted peanuts, cigarette tobacco, chicken spices, curcuma, toasted bread, roasted bell pepper, clove-like phenols and a lot of them, faint strawberry sweetishness peeping through, horseradish. Fruity onset, dried peach, hints of redcurrant, mandarin and red apple, only very vaguely sweetish, more sourish, mineral accents here and there, softish carbo, supple and lean mouthfeel, spicy phenols showing up shyly at first but growing in strength later on. These impressions continue over a smooth nutty malt middle gaining a soft, toasted bittering edge in the end, while drying spiciness and hoppiness add more substantial bitterness, resulting in a medium long to long bitter finish, peppery and leafy with an earthy yeast quality accentuating it especially after adding the sediment; juniper berry- and vaguely clove-like spicy notes rise up retronasally but fortunately not in an obnoxious way. Label does not mention spices so I assume these effects are from a purely phenolic nature and indeed, it can easily be established that this is a very phenolic beer, albeit not unpleasantly so; it is, however, rather unusual and a bit untidy, with a deep hop bitterness and hop aromas almost reminiscent of the old English style IPA... Feels somewhat unbalanced; perhaps some more rounded malt sweetness could make it better, but then, who am I to judge how an ancient Norwegian thirst quencher should taste like... That being said, there is little or no reference on the label to actual historical sources, so I have a suspicion that this is only traditional ale by inspiration (and some extent of imagination), and not so much from a truly physical and technical point of view. Remains the question: is it a pleasant beer? It has a phenolic character which is all too strong for my personal liking and the deep hop bitterness could be better balanced or more elegantly put, but on the other hand, it has certain characteristics which remind me of Orval, and that works to its benefit, I guess, though it does not come close to that standard.  It does, however, speak for a Belgian, in some respects saison-like influence, bringing me back to my abovementioned point of this probably being not too authentically Scandinavian at all in terms of style and pedigree. Ill give it the benefit of the doubt.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

2578,"2012-09-27",4.0,"Gorgeous cloudy very dark golden pour topped by a dense, small-bubbled, meringue-like white head which remains thick and firm as sips go by. Another lovely and fairly unique ale from Haandbryggeriet. Has a garden quality to it (herbs, spices, green character, earthy, vegetal, tea leaves, flowers...) that reminds me of Terre Ferme from à lAbri de la Tempête, but this is a far maltier, relatively thick for its strenght ale with a leathery, smoked ham smokiness that is not subtle, yet does not dominate at all. Surprisingly, there is a lot of bubble activity in there, but those valliant bubbles are all soft and uniform, never giving a biting impression, rather cleansing up the palate between sips and cutting any hints at sugariness. Yet it does not feel all that dry either thanks to its chewy side. I find it impressive when I encounter a beer I find both quite thick and not very sweet at all. Akin to a very good multi-grain dense bread which feels nourishing in its multi-dimensional malt profile, but that you can easily eat several slices of without tiring yourself. A bit weird on the yeast profile which has a phenolic side that I dont find fitting with all the rest thats already going on. A zesty lemony/orangey hop bite concludes it all nicely. Unique and very satisfying.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Smoked ham, rosemary and straw flavors conjure up a memorable concoction, sealed by earthy hops and rustic yeast.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A veil of foam touches the cloudy amber.
-The prickly bubbles and crunchy cereals create a healthy mouthfeel. A more recent batch I had (July 2013 was too carbonated for my tastes though)
-Floral hops and rosemary team up to build a surprising freshness.
-Rosemary, smoke, rye and straw are all leveled.
-Looking forward to finding out if this is the type of brew traditional Norwegian homebrewers still brew today!

Sneaking a sip gave  me a blast of surprise. I had no idea this beer was killer smoky - I love beer surprises. I certainly cannot full that type of strength out of the aroma. Interesting aroma indeed: thick roast, minerally water, smouldering dry grass, some sort of potpourri mishmash of perfumy scents minus the lavender, some variant of caramel with a bit of earth. The fruitiness is apparently from produce brought from a distant planet - dont ask me how I know that or even how it gets here - just know that I tell the truth. Fascinating aroma. The flavours are equally interesting - what a wacky well put together beer. Somehow this is actually refreshing - Presario made me consider that after reading his review.

2578,"2011-05-28",3.6,"There are some really clever guys working at Haandbryggeriet. The name of this beer, the label and the flavours all bring back memories from my childhood summers, that were spent on a tiny farm in southern Norway. The aroma is fruity and yeasty, with a sweet honey note. I didnt get many farm associations when smelling the beer, but the flavours are all barn, hay, earth from the newly dug potatoes and even some smoke from the burning of dead leaves and grass. The taste is initially moderate to light sweet followed by an amazing mix of moderate bitterness and a pronounced moderate sourness, very nice! The liquid is hazy, dark amber, with an average off-white head that rather quickly reduces to a thin layer that leaves a fair amount of lacing. Medium body, dry texture, soft carbonation.

It pours a nice orange/red/amber copper color with a foamy, but sudsy off-white head that has some soapiness to it. It recedes slowly with some nice lacing.

The smell is lightly smoky but refreshing. It has notes of smoke but also some fruits like oxidized apple and candied orange peel. There is some spiciness from the yeast and the rye. Rounding it out is some caramel sweetness.

The flavor is a little less smoky and more of a funky and fruity beer. It has notes of wild yeast that add a bit of barnyard funk. It works nicely with the interesting malt bill.

Crystal clear colour, with thick bits of foam diminishing. Aroma is rich (overly) fruity, with smokey ashes and jelly-ish feel to it.

2578,"2010-11-15",3.0,"In short: A strange herbaceous ale.  Hard to rate
How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed soon after purchase but this was about 8 months after bottling date.  I dont expect to drinking mega-fresh Norwegian beers in North-America
The look: Clear dark golden body topped by a medium beige head
In long: Nose has a strong and strange floral/perfumed character.  Taste is equally off.  Harvest ales are a strange bunch, and this one is one the strangest of them all.  Some juniper berries, fresh green pine needles, red apples, spices, tea, glazed cinnamon bun, herbs.  Not sure what else to add, I seem to be picking up strange unrelated flavors in this one.  After a full bottle I still didnt if I liked it or not, so Im giving it my just ok rate of 3.0.  Funny thing is I found this beer in a case I brought back with me from a little road trip and I have no memory ever buying this.  Maybe I have a bad memory.

2578,"2010-10-25",3.7,"Speckled rusty-orange. Persistent off-white head. Polished yet equally rustic aroma of plum flesh and Juicy Fruit gum intertwined with biscuits, minerals, conifer tips/clove, hay dust, black pepper, dusty yeast, earthy malt, plaster, oats and smoke. Robustly phenolic as well, with sharp underlying notes of iron and fennel. Bottle-conditioned carbonation provides dense carbonation and a soft caress. Opens very delicately with a flawlessly balanced medley of smoked bread and palate-hugging haylike malt textures. Rustic notes are never far behind as the dusty yeast clings to the malt and raspy smoke while the crackling phenols provide balance. Succulent surge of fresh plum contributes ample brightness and depth to the core while sharp but clean alcohol augments the black-pepper snap and lightens the body by displacing some of the residual sugars. All the while the deep-seated malt remains steadfast in its immovable, albeit squeaky-clean, girth. A finishing flourish of alcohol and conifer tips yields faint astringency at the finish, though creamed coffee and assertive tobacco soften it nicely. Aside from the alcohol, which deadens some brightness and subtleties, this is quite good. Would love to see the alcohol brought down to around 5%.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Flavor is pronounced smoke, wood, malt, and some sort of herb that functions like hop to cut the sweet, but suggests fir twigs. I think these Norskis just grab whatevers growin nearby and toss it in. Works damn well too. Finishes smoky, mildly malty and something herby. Am wandering whether this is a gruit type. Their website doesnt indicate such, but see notes below from website.

A moderate head of dense, spongy, beige tinted foam is slow to recede, eventually forming a thin but lasting blanket with a solid rim.  Sudsy, spotty lacing mostly rejoins the body below.  The nose is quite unique, showing notes of smoke and earth amidst hints of green peas and days-old arugula, with a bevy of twiggy spice notes and an underlying base of caramelized and blonde sugars.  Flavors feature a faded, grassy hoppiness and notes of withered tea leaves, with a resounding smokiness and a slight caramel sweetness.  Theres definitely a canned English pea component that some hate, but I dont mind one bit.

Pours a deep, clear amber, extremely lively, with bubbles feeding a three inch creamy white head that shows excellent retention.  There is solid lacing on the way down.

The aroma is interesting, caramel sweetness with a lightly smoked character.  There are some spices and herbs, maybe juniper, and sweet fruits and hops.

The taste has an earthy hop kick up front with some sweet berries and apricots on a more heavily smoked malt backbone than the aroma suggest.  The finish has some sweetness and hops but its the interesting hickory smoked flavor that lingers on the palate after each sip.

The mouthfeel is medium bodied and moderately carbonated which seems to balance the smokiness very well.

Update 2010-09-11 - batch 286, brewed 2010-05-11, BB 2012-05-11. Beautiful nose, fills the room with strawberries. The aroma is sweet with a nice hint of malt, and a very very fruity aftertaste, red berries marching forward to take the stand. Sweet mama, oh yes. Less wood and pine this time, more berry sweetness. And good golly miss molly, this is just wonderful. Some woody earthy pine-ish aromas on the edges still, but tonight its the red berry strawberry-malt which makes me go mmmm! Letting it linger brings out a longlasting fruity malt aroma which is great. At the same time its a lot of citrus and spicy freshness here, which makes this a really well balanced, beautiful brew! I wouldnt mind using this as a thirst quencher!

 HB seems to have sorted out their carbonization problem as well, because this one is just as sparkly as I like it.

A beer that needs to be chilled or at cellar temp to be thoroughly enjoyed, not ice cold, as that wont reveal what it has to offer. Will definately have to buy more of this one. 100126","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"
2578,"2010-01-25",3.8,"500ml bottle. Dark orange colored body with firm off-white head. Floral malty with traces of roasted malt for both taste and aroma. Plenty of hoops in aroma as well. Nice bitter aftertaste.","Søgne, NORWAY","fobar"
2578,"2010-01-23",3.8,"500 ml bottle . Batch 254. Pours deep hazy dark orange with a big frothy tan head. Aroma of yeasty malt, apricots and dark sugar. Taste is sweet, but dark in a nice way, like dark chocolate caramel, nice bitter towards the end, i have never tasted anything like this, but its good, with its own character.","Sandnes, NORWAY","gunnar"
2578,"2010-01-22",3.5,"Bottle. Cloudy orange with a medium head. Hints of smoked malts in the nose as well as fruity hops. In the mouth smokiness is quite prevalent, but good hop bitterness and fruit makes it quite refreshing. Fizzy. Original.","Oslo, NORWAY","thebeertourist"
2578,"2010-01-17",3.5,"500 ml bottle. Dark golden to orange body with a fine, big, stable off-white head. Aroma is quite mild but very nice, some caramel/toffee, fruity like oranges, a little hint of honey and a pleasant acidic hint. Flavor is fruity like peaches, some caramel, a hint of honey, nice balanced bitterness  and a smooth fruity acidity in the finish. Medium body and an almost extreme quaffability factor here. This is a fine beer for refreshing with enough flavors to suit a few lighter dishes, well done again!","Kristiansand, NORWAY","Beer5000"
2578,"2010-01-15",3.3,"Its very nice to have Haandbryggeriet come up with a refreshing concept such as this one, since their performance has been varying a lot over the years in my opinion. This one delivers what it promises: an original, hoppy, floral, heystack-ish in-your-face-beer that really makes you feel as if you were just getting a break from the harsh harvest work on a traditional Norwegian farm. Not quite like any other beer out there, Hesjeøl gains quite a few points on originality despite the fact that Id probably not be very inclined to drink more than one bottle at any given time due - also due to its somewhat peculiar flavor. Nevertheless: thumbs up for Haandbryggeriet this time.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"
2578,"2010-01-12",3.7,"500 ml bottle, batch #240, from Vinmonopolet. ABV is 6.5%. Light brown hazy colour, big off-white head. Lovely aroma of fruity hops and orange peel, also notes of Belgian ale yeast and mild spices. The flavour is a bit too sweet for a beer for sweaty farm workers, but still good - also fruity, yeasty and spicy notes, hints of caramel, with a distinct hoppy bitterness and a hint of smoke in the finish.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"
2578,"2009-12-31",3.5,"330 ml draught at Håndverkerstuene. Dark reddish brown colour. Small off-white head.  Rich malty aroma with notes of leather and a light spicy hops. Light Belgian yeast aroma as well. Mellow velvety malt flavours. Low carbonation level, which I guess is caused by the kegs used. Could have used more carbonation to make it livelier. Something in between a saison and their Ardennes Blond. Nicely balanced beer, which I would think would go really well with food.","Oslo, NORWAY","Gr0ve"
2578,"2009-11-26",3.7,"Bottle at the brewery. Pours a hazy dark orange, 1 finger tan head. Aroma is dusty, funky, hay, belgian yeast, wheat, light fruits, apricots perhaps. Its fairly sweet, but has a nice refreshing semidry finish. Quite like a saison, and a very drinkable and good one at that. Carbonation was too lively, hopefully this will be toned down.","Årnes, NORWAY","Kestral"
2578,"2009-10-16",3.8,"Sampled at the brewery. A powered-up version of their Blondie. A dense offwhite head resting on an unclear, orangey to light amber colored body. Belgo-yeast up front,  slightly perfumed fruitiness with a sour touch. Some mild spices and a whiff of biscuity malts. Taste has a soft malt characther, slightly sweet, with notes of mild spices. A certain funky, acidulous fruitiness underneath. Quite filling. Smooth, almost creamy in the mouth. A very good one, high drinkability!","Oslo, NORWAY","OleR"
2578,"2009-10-16",3.7,"Tasting at the brewery, but this will be on general release.
Lovely barnyard aroma, saison-like. Brewed with 10% oats, and there is 25% smoked malt, too, but it blends in so well that there is no smoked character. Some Belgian yeast character. Very likeable, would be great with food.","Oslo, NORWAY","KnutAlbert"
