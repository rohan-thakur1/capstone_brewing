3712,"2017-04-17",2.9,"On tap at McFate, pours a clear copper golden with a small white head. Aroma brings out restrained toasted biscuity malt and a hint of dry caramel. Flavour is along the same lines, with bready malts and again a touch of dry caramel. Very malty and medium sweet on the finish. Decent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
3712,"2016-09-27",3.4,"Hazy deep amber red pour with small off white head. Aroma of malts, caramel, bready and slight hops. Taste of malts, bread dough, yeast, caramel and faint hops. Light bodied, medium carbonation, nicely balanced.","Calgary, CANADA","maley1"
3712,"2015-04-16",4.2,"Draft. Tawny copper, slightly hazy. Burnt orange at the edges. Thin, wispy head of sandy tan. A swirl sends sweet stuff to the nose first: caramel, sweet cherry, apple. Milk chocolate and toasted bread make up the back end. Roasty, nutty flavor. Walnuts, baked apples, subtle chocolate, maybe light roast coffee beans. Tangy caramelized sugars. Roasted cocoa lingers. Medium body, mild carbonation. The best Irish red Ive had -- it combines qualities of red and brown ales.","","PartyFowle"
3712,"2015-03-14",3.0,"On draft at the source. Killians coming at ya hot. Amber reddish pour with off white head. Caramel, grain, and light apple with a dry grainy element. Average for what it is.","Connecticut, USA","Reynolds314"

3712,"2015-02-18",3.4,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2015 great easy drinker. Very plain as it should be with some nuances of caramel and grains. Toasty and biscuity with some grassy hop. True to the style.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
3712,"2014-10-15",3.2,"Tap at the brewpub. The look is reddish in color, a beige colored head, and a slight haze. The smell is toast, burnt, malt, ash, and ok. The taste is fruit, caramel, toast, and grain.","Dallas, Texas, USA","travita"
3712,"2014-08-18",3.3,"On tap: The aroma consists of light fruit, caramel, and toasted nuts. Its a transparent dark amber with a small off-white head that quickly fades to a thin film outlined by a slightly thicker ring. There is some hints webbing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with light-moderate caramel and light fruit. The finish has light toasty notes with faint roasted nuts. Its light bodied with light-moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty standard Amber Ale.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
3712,"2014-06-11",3.5,"Pint at the brewery. Mild roasted malt and slight baked apples highlight the moderate aroma with some caramel. Pours a nice semi-hazy deep auburn with a cream-colored head. A sweet nutty tone is the prominent flavor early with a moderate chewy toffee note, mild whole-grain toast, and a medium earthy hoppiness. Medium body, spiced long finish. Solid brew.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"

3712,"2014-01-23",3.1,"Arrives from the tap with a thinish, tan colored head that quickly disappears. The beer is a deep red color that is a bit hazy when held up to the light and shows a gold tinged red / amber hue. The aroma smells like an Irish red; lowish hop character with a malt focus that leans towards caramel, touches of toffee, a bit of light caramelized fruitiness, as well as a light caramelized nutty note.

Lightly sweet up front, it gets more sweet with fruit and caramelized notes becoming more prominent as it slides across the tongue. Touches of sweet tea, caramelized crystal malt, light nutty notes, and a hint of toasted whole grain character. The hop character is quite light; this has a touch of bitterness to it, but barely there, with the sweet, caramelized malt dominating the hop / malt balance, and there is perhaps a hint of herbal hop character. The body has a nice chewiness to it for a beer of this strength.

Not bad, actually a fairly good take on the style. I am personally not really a huge fan of the style, but if you are then this is a well made one that you should try.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3712,"2013-06-12",3.6,"Tap sample. Poured reddish amber with an average frothy off-white head that lasted and produced excellent lacing. Moderate toasted sweet malt aroma. Medium to abundant body with a smooth texture and soft carbonation. Medium sweet bitters flavor with a sweet finish of moderate duration. This beer would go well with spicy pizza.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
3712,"2013-06-05",3.4,"Tap at the brewery. Rating #9. Nice amber/red color and a little dark with those colors with an off white head. Nice maltiness too it with a very light hop presence. Good stuff. (2773)","Redlands, by way of Wisconsin,, California, USA","Hophead22"
3712,"2013-06-02",2.8,"Nice red color, beyond that the accolades are hard to come by.  The beer was underattenuated and had a sweet syrupy homebrew tinge to it. Was also overly hopped for the style. Would have been better classified as an American Amber instead of an Irish Red.","USA","bigbeersrule"
3712,"2013-05-26",3.9,"Growler from Fate!  Deep ruby pour with hints of scarlet, crimson, and garnet at its core.  Milky eggshell head.  Loads of grapefruit, freshly baked biscuit, honey, toasted oats, and caramel.  Really complex for a style that rarely is.  Silky smooth mouthfeel.  Delicious!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
3712,"2013-05-22",3.2,"On tap at Fate. It pours with a clear copper body that supports an off white head of foam. The aroma offers up some sweetness from apples and raisins and a sense of sort of earthy malts. The taste has some malt roastiness and malt earthiness as well as a little bit of spiced red apple and raisins. Im not really feeling this one come together.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

3712,"2013-01-27",3.6,"Reddish pour, mostly a white colored head.  The beer has a really good hint of hops up front, a bit of citrus, some bready malt notes.   Pretty nice for a style that falls flat quite often.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
