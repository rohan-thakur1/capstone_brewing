A: Clear and yellow. There is a moderately sized head of white bubbles that leaves a small amount of lacing. Lots of bubbles emanating from the depths of the glass indicate a healthy level of carbonation.

S: Weak aroma overall with some subtle sweet malts.

T: Surprisingly, this is a decent beer. Its not that I dont have a healthy respect for Rogue Brewery, I just didnt expect a malt liquor to not be repulsive. Dads Little Helper has helped me to adjust my paradigm. Its sweet, but not nearly so much as many of the infamous, cheap malt liquors out there.

2988,"2012-07-21",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 23, 2012 I believe Rogue ceased production of Dads Little Helper Malt Liquor in 2010 or early 2011 - which would technically make this a vintage. I picked up a bottle at my beer store because it was half off. I was prepared for something nasty, but I was shocked when the beer was not only drinkable, but very enjoyable! Its nothing like a ""malt liquor"" in the least, but goes to show that any style can be brewed to taste great.

I poured a dusty 22oz bottle into a one liter boot stein.

Appearance: Rusty/dirty honey color; fine carbonation bubbles visible around the edges. Forms a large, white, frothy head which retains and laces wonderfully.

Smell: Initially a generic beer smell, but a closer inspection reveals a strong sweetness - especially of honey and some confectionary/syrupy notes.

Taste: Much like the nose, the palate begins with a honey and confectionary sweetness. A distinct maltiness with flavors of toffee and caramel - similar to that of an Oktoberfest or Marzen-style brew. Ive experienced these flavors in imperial helles bock, but nothing remotely close to this in a ""malt liquor."" Im not quite sure how or why Rogue gets away with classifying this beer as such. Perhaps its due to the use of flaked corn and a Czech pilsner yeast. Still, theres nothing about this that tastes foul, dirty or cheap like a 40oz youd buy from the corner store.

While not the best beer Ive ever had, I must admit that Dads Little Helper Malt Liquor is probably the most impressive. Not only because of the style but because of the age of my bottle. I genuinely enjoyed every sip and was surprised by how sweet the palate was. Very little bitterness, no alcohol presence in the palate, and a mostly clean aftertaste. 

Drinkability: Though technically a lager, Dads Little Helper Malt Liquor has the mouthfeel, body, and overall presence of an ale. The texture is somewhat watery, but certainly doesnt taste flat or mild. Its also not overly carbonated as it goes down remarkably smooth. I would be able to chug a beer boot of this without any problem. Theres a slightly chalky/dry aftertaste, but its easily tolerable. Allegedly 8% ABV, but youd never know because theres no booziness to the palate and it doesnt fill you up or overwhelm you either. If I had to chug 40oz of a malt liquor, Id make it this one for sure.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Aroma of creamed corn and grainy pale malts with alcohol and a little garbage juice to balance things out.  The flavor is just as unappetizing as the aroma.  Vile alcohol, grainy corn, and very little malt to speak of.  Not sure if there are any hops used in this at all.  Mouthfeel is super carbonated and fizzy with a watery texture.

Smell is anything but strong, but hints at cooked corn, grain, and a small bit of alcohol. Actually tastes good - bakers cocoa and caramel take their place with husky grain, cooked corn, and just a hint of the alcohol. Light bodied as expected, with moderate to full carbonation. All-in-all, not a bad beer. Not something Id get all the time, but for the style, its definitely one of the better ones (though not quite as good as DFH Liquor de Malt IMO) - reminds me of a tastier better-made version of Steel Reserve.","Derry, New Hampshire, USA","BigBen2120"

Remarkably sweet, reminding me of a fruit lambic, but without any of the lovely funk or tart acid that one would expect.  Still not an unpleasant flavor. But way too sweet.

It is slightly reminiscent of a beer infused cream soda or something...  Anyways, it is soft and smooth and very easy to drink.  It is definitely not a typical malt liquor!

Very clear dirty orange and a quick fizz head, this sucker keeps fizzing non stop. Zero head in seconds so it appears flat. Smells like your moms nailpolish, not mine. Malts. Sweaty and not good, but, compared to any other malt liquor out there (with the exception being Extra Old Stock) this might be the best smelling malt liquor around. Smells better and softer after a while. I can feel the headache comming already. Ive also been debating at what point Im going to sink this stuff. Strong lagers are never good unless you live inside a dumpster and youve found a small fortune of bent pennies and nickels in various parking lots and gutters. Taste is fairly clean, malty and a large ammount of noticable alcohol, but its still consummable without grimacing. Slightly sour yeast. Pretty straight forward. Mouthfeel is excellent. Light bodied, fairly smooth with a lack of overcarbonation (thank God), sour harsh bitter finish, but not in a bad way. Look, its Rogue so you expect quality and quality has been found here. This needs to be in 12 bottles though. No unwashed indian will steal 7.49$ to drink this. Theyd spend it on 3 or 4 cans of Olympia instead. Specially made for sofisticated alcoholics like us. Never again. If I want to drink to get drunk, Ill violate a bottle of La Fin Du Monde for the same price. If I was to compare this against other beers of its style, this may get five 10s, and normally I would and I probally should, but this is malt liquor - the toilet of the industry. So I cant.

Nice taste, good and refreshing, caramel malts and sweet hops comprise nearly all the taste.

Would the $6 bottle of Rogue be that much better than the $1.19 can?  It pours clear gold with a one finger white head and a sweet corn and malt aroma.  The taste is sweet malt with a touch of citrus fruit esters.  The malt liquor corn is in there too.  It’s light to medium bodied and finishes sweet with a touch of alcohol.  It’s drinkable and not bad.  I finished it, unlike the Hurricane.  So in conclusion, the Rogue malt liquor is, as one might expect, much better than the $1.19 can of Hurricane.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured clear, medium yellow (almost gold really) with nice carbonation and a small, white head that mostly diminished and left virtually no lacing. The aroma was moderate caramel malt, light grass hops and corn. The initial flavor was moderately sweet and lightly acidic; while the finish was moderate to heavily sweet, light to moderately acidic, lightly bitter and a little sour with an average duration. There was mostly caramel malt then a little grassy hops.

The corn actually has a nice fresh quality to it, not the sickly DMS trait.  The hops have this weird dusty/planty quality and dont really have any bright floral, herbal, or citrus qualities - just a dirty, planty bitterness.  Full bodied, sparkling carbonation with a sizzling prickle.  Heavy and sticky sweet, with flavors of corn syrup striking the palate immediately.  Rather hoppy, this beer develops a strong bitterness (for a malt liquor) toward the back end, but its certainly not a pleasant sensation.  The flavors are more of the stale planty bitterness found in the aroma.  I would actually prefer the hops to be dialed back a bit, allowing the clean malt flavors to come out a bit more.  More attenuation would also be beneficial.  With those tweaks, I think this could be a really tasty malt liquor.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Nearly flavorless... corn-heavy macrolager... a suggestion of floral/honey character. Overall sulphur/industrial chimney impression. Barely recognizable hop bitterness. Minimal carbonation contributes to a flabby, oily mouthfeel. Quality of the bottles contents are far outshadowed by the bottle itself. Overall, tastes like gummy, bile-soured hangover mouth.

Unfortunately it has that sicky sweet characteristic of mass malt liquors. Gee, but its sweet. On balance there are some bitter notes. The sweetness is a bit reminiscent of a Belgian ale. There is grape, and perhaps honey, but the effect is not what one would hope for in an ale. It gets credit for making malt liquor drinkable.

2988,"2007-07-09",2.7,"UPDATED: NOV 2, 2011 On tap at the mad Mexican in Robinson. As a father, I have plenty of  respect for the name of this brew. There has undoubtedly much  thought put into this brew and it is one of the most refined beers Ive the chance of tastin.  Malt liquor is a vile kenard for this brew. Surprising aroma of apples and berries. Looks like the every day pale yellow american lager beer. Initial flavor is rather astonishing!  Wine like, but not syrupy sweet, more like a quality aged wine. Very little detectable bitterness. No carbonation. Fruity yet not exceptionally sweet. At first this brew has an alky impact but that morphs into A more mild watered added wine finish. Hey, I think my taste buds are going numb! An interesting brew that makes me wonder if this is really a beer or not. As  a  lowly lager lover, this is just not quite the malt liquor style, Im sorry. If you like wine, give this a try. I am very glad to have had the chance to taste this beer. The waitress was very friendly. She commented that many lager drinkers dont care for  this brew. I am ashamed to name the other malt liquors Ive tried but let me tell you, this brew is in a class of its own and it is in no way associated or similar to those unmentionable unrefined brews.

2988,"2007-07-03",2.3,"22 oz bottle at pre-RBSG tasting
I brought this along because something compelled me to pick it up at Rileys on a recent trip.  Even at $2.99 it was probably overpriced but unfortunately you cant return beer just because it seemed like a bad thing to pick (if you could, there are any number of other beers that I might have done that with).  This is a malt liquor - you can say what you want about it but the result is the same.  The only difference between this and a 40 oz can is that this is ever so slightly more palateable.
Aroma / Appearance - What is there to say about something so simple?  Corn forms the base of the aroma which has a bit of an odd funk to it.  The clear transparent body hides nothing from sight.  Perhaps thats why people drink it out of a brown paper bag.  That way you dont have to see what it is you are trying to get down.
Flavor / Palate - Corn is the order of the day here.  Theres no complexity at all though it is suprisingly drinkable.  The alcohol is thinly disguised by the pseduo-malts but comes through in the end.  All I have to say is that if I were to open this by myself about 12 ounces would be going down the drain.  It isnt a drain pour due to lack of quality to style.  Its just that the style as a whole is one that doesnt deserve much attention.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

A nice, pleasant sweet malt liquor nose, Im impressed, the pilsener yeast really comes through, sweet pale malts with highlights of sweet corn, a good lemon honey fruitiness, traces of alcohol, not fusel or solvent, but a clear gin-like alcohol, overall, an appealing aroma for a malt liquor.

Good steady carbonation, not fizzy at all, and a sweetly crisp, dry, thin, for a malt liquor, silky smooth, none of the alcoholic roughness one expects with the style, light bodied mouthfeel, wins points with me.

Since I am no longer living in poverty, a member of the working poor, I am now part of the petty bourgeoisie, malt liquor has lost a lot of its appeal to me, but for the style, I found this to be quite enjoyable, easy to consume, lemon honey and sweet corn, thin, sweet pale malts that meshes well with the alcohol, providing a sugary warmth in the palate, none of that sickly sugary sweetness that a lot of malt liquors have, the hops are minimal, true to the style, and a dry, thin malty, lemony finish, a nice and clean finish, no alcoholic harshness, well done.","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"

Normally this style is known for being exceptionally disgusting, and generally an excuse to package jet fuel and sell it to junkies looking for a cheap drunk. Yes, malt liquor is generally shit beer. So was this any different? Did Rogue finally allow me to see this style in a different light? Yes and no. I would say that this beer was certainly well crafted in the sense that it didnt have any of the harsh alcohol and otherwise empty sugary palate that most have. The aroma wasnt off-putting either- - corn syrup and pear juice was a little odd, but not horrible. I didnt get any stinky sewage corn adjunct stench that a couple of other raters found. The flavour was mostly corn syrup malt, but there was an astringent bitterness in the finish that kept it from becoming cloying. The alcohol was barely evident in the palate. I didnt find this appalling as several other raters did, but neither did I enjoy it all that much. Definitely my least favourite of the Rogue range so far, and not one Id come back to.

Aroma is nearly non existent as it kinda stymies itself in a hovering pale sweetness of malt grain thats soft and bready and hard to get in the nose unless you wiff in big.

Taste is all solid malty smoothness, but not a whole lot of flavor really. Dulled...dulled some more and semi, lightly tanged and cloying malty breadish tones with a heavy buttered corn accent topping off the middle into the finish. Finish is quick but soft and creamy with a malty body and clean Maibock-like cloying sweetness that coats the mouth well. The Harrington malts are quite evident with that certain bready, doughy centeredness of paled, dull tang and soaking.

Feel is quite nice. Malt is king of this throne. Ruling with a steady hand of Harrington malt coating ever so smoothly with bready softness and sticky, cloying thickness thats not overbearing but definately pushing its borders with a clean slice of medium body and a fairly long rule of semi sweet, bready, tangaifingly broad scape of malty clean soothingness.

Might have made an interesting beer if the hops played a role.  However, in the tradition of a malt liquor, the hops are very subdued.  I cant even call this refreshing.  The heavy sweetness is just too much.  Not quite syrupy, but the mouthfeel is thick and heavy.  Maybe some honey.  alcohol is poking through, which is pathetic for a 7% beer.  Chances are I wont be able to finish this.  Probably one of the best malt liquors made, but that doesnt say much.  I feel bad giving this a terrible rating, since its not like Rogue screwed up.

A bit of sweetness and a decent bit of cardboard as well. A little bit of lemon to boot!  The palate is surpisingly creamy, easily the best part of the beer.  Im having a hard time finding the words to describe this beer, something I find odd given the amount of malt liquor Ive drank in the past...  Grainy, slightly sweet, with a bit of floral hops giving some balance.  And then there is the malt liquor tang accompanied by that slight taste of alcohol.

Well, I have this project of sampling any Rogue product I can get my hands on and using the bottles to create a nice montage in my kitchen since they have a nice thematic appearance.

Ive had some of which I could not even finish the bomber. I think this  particular ""beer"" may make me quite sad. I pour it directly and hurridly down into a two pint mug to stir up a head. and, lo, it does indeed create a rather frothy head atop the golden body.  Ah, the aroma of malt liquor. It does, however, seem like what malt liquor ought to smell like: creamed corn sweetness and some slightly bitter notes like corn husks. The nasty fuel notes are missing, at least in the aroma. Still, this does not exactly smell good.  Hm. This is quite well rounded for the style. Plenty of sugary sweetness and theres a strange papery note that sits in the background. Theres corn throughout  and the alcohol starts to come out in the finish. uh-oh theres the weird malt liquor off-flavor poking its head out. hm, the head is gone now too. Here comes some more bad news: I think Im tasting dirty armpits. This is going to be a chore to finish.All I can think about is the next beer I must drink to cover up this one. The lack of hoppiness really makes me crave an IIPA, but on the other hand, it seems an imperial stout would be the antithesis to this crap. anyway, I think Ill put this bottle up next to Shakespeare to keep him some company.

Smells of deep corn, grain, and hints of alcohol. A lot like a regular malt liquor, actually. No Rogue pacmanniness, or anything. Just cheap grain. 

Tastes pretty decent. Good pils grain up front, moving into a dry, sweet yeast in the middle which floats into a kettle corn kind of sweetness, ending on a solid dry cascade hop. The brew loses .5 due to an unfortunate chemical aftertaste--just like you get in Olde English or Mickeys!

2988,"2006-06-02",3.0,"Pours a golden yellow color. Aromas of corn, grains, and a little hops. Flavor is smooth grainy with a detectable hop presence, finishes with a sweetness and a little alcohol tingle.","Fort Walton Beach, Florida, USA","oldrtybastrd"
2988,"2006-06-01",2.7,"UPDATED: NOV 20, 2010 Had a bomber tonight and was fairly disappointed. Seems like craft breweries taking on malt liquor is a mini-craze right now, but Rogues doesnt hold a candle to some of the other offerings. Nice looking beer with a rich golden/copper color and marginal head. But while theres nothing too offensive about the aroma, it tastes thin and syrupy. Cant imagine going back to this.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"
2988,"2006-05-30",3.2,"Bomber, Noogfest, Hennepin glass.  Light golden hue with a slight chill haze and a small, frothy white head.  Standard malt liquor aromas of corn, fusels and sweet bread, but nothing sticks out sharply and nothing is really nasty (but still, not really good either).  Interesting that I can smell some spicy hops...thats a little bit out of style, heh.  Fairly sweet taste but never disgustingly so.  Some bananas find their way into the taste which was an interesting surprise.  Medium bodied with a slick texture and medium, but delicate, carbonation.  No alcohol detectible.  Hell, it may be a malt liquor but Id take its mouthfeel and slap it on any number of better beers that suffer from thin wateriness.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"
2988,"2006-05-30",2.8,"Market Square Liquors, Tallahassee, Fl. - 22 oz bomber. Dark golden pour, slight white head. Boozy, fruit salad-like aroma. Honey-sweet flavor with some cake mix bready sweetness. Slightly sticky mouthfeel for a malt liquor - missing that throat clencing dryness that malt liquors tend to have. Passable and the novelty is enjoyed and appreciated.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"
2988,"2006-05-30",3.2,"Shared a 22oz.-er with my Daddy.  Wasnt sure what to expect.  Its always fun when a craft brewery puts out a malt liquor.  This one definitely has a depth of flavor and aroma which you cant get from the likes of Mickeys, Schlitz, Colt 45, Evil Eye, or even Steel Reserve.  Then again, thats not saying a whole lot.  This is a really corny beer.  The body is honey-gold (a little bit darker than your average malt liquor), its got that syrupy mouthfeel.  And its a little on the sweet side, although a little bit of hoppiness and carbonation keeps things interesting.  Thisll be a good one to share with your dad whose beer tastes have perhaps been limited to the same three macro brewers for most of his drinking life.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Fish"
2988,"2006-05-28",2.3,"22 oz bottle. Clear dark golden color with bubbly white head. Toasty caramel nose with a touch of light skunky hops. Flavor is similar, but is also accented by corn and a splash of alcohol at the end. Not bad, but not my cup o tea.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"
2988,"2006-05-27",3.0,"22 oz. bottle.  A clear piss-yellow pour with a small and fizzy off-white head.  This beer features the crisp smell of corn with just a bit of caramel.  Thin and watery.  Goes down crisp.  Caramel starts things off and transitions to some grain and corniness.  Pretty sugary and syrupy sweet.  Good for a malt liquor, but why even bother?","Washington DC, USA","lamas"

Malty, sweet flavor, but spiced up decently with those crystal hops. Medium to full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and fizzy carbonation. Finishes sweet and alcoholic with mild bitterness. Good malt liquor. Why craft brewers do this style, I have no idea. I guess its fun for them. Why heavy metal bands do ballads, I have no idea. I guess its fun for them. Both disciplines do a really good job at the crossover attempt, putting full-time swill and ballad makers to shame. Yep, I guess thats fun.

Syrupy flavors. Best thing this had going was a velvety mouthfeel at times, with notes of marshmallow in a boozy finish. Burns a bit going down.

Oily, translucent gold with a touch of bubbling, smallish white fizzy head decays quickly into a thin ring....sweet corn syrup and pale malt aroma, no hint of hops but for faint fresh grassiness....thick, syrupy body with little alcohol apparency, not quite cloying when cold but certainly sticky when warmer....honey-sweet palate with faint dry hop hints, mild finishing bitterness, and noticeable clean malty character....no real off aromas or flavors, no metallic aftertaste; while not quite as enjoyable as the DFH rendition, this does help to prove that a ML can be drinkable, at least.

Palate: I think this is leaving me with the feeling I need to open another beer to actually taste something, theres nothing happening in this beer completely one dimensional!
Overall: An unbalanced beer, and in my opinion a less than adequate effort from John and company(Good thing theres plenty more Rogue to try!).","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","WBC"

A bit of malt is actually apparent underneath it though.  Fairly sweet, with a thin, cidery body.  The first few attempts where good breweries made malt liquors were pretty funny...now Im not sure sure that proving you can make something that tastes like ass is all that compelling.  Either way, its definitely authentic.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"
