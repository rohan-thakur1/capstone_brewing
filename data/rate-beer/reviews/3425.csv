3425,"2017-01-30",3.5,"Bottle from Turdferguson, dated 9.25.15, drunk 12/17/16.Dark auburn-chestnut with darker mahogany hues, a good clarity and a small, beige head atop flecked with pink, showing moderate retention for the style.Lots of acidity in the nose seems to come primarily from the critters. Brett fruitiness and tartness sits alongside a strong, warming acetic character providing cherry and vinegar, as oak notes deepen the complexity. Blackberry character has subsided somewhat, but still adds poignant acidity and fruitiness. Vanilla and caramel lie behind things, providing light balance. Some alcohol noted and overall quite intense, perhaps a bit aggressive.More given to softer wood tannins and malty caramel notes, with good attenuation but still a supple texture. The acidity builds up quickly though; as theres plenty of it. Fruit, critters, oak, red wine; its all here in force and comes off just a bit too punchy and acidic for my taste. I think with a little less acetic character and maybe a bit less astringency from the tannin, this would be significantly better. As is, I still enjoyed it, it just got too fatiguing by the middle to end.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
