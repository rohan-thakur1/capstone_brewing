3618,"2008-10-25",3.5,"Cask conditioned at The Woolpack, Banbury. Pale gold with white head. Ah, the old Goldings hop, perfumey, peachy, hop oily, all the typical Goldings adjectives were used in the Pub last night and yes they were spot on, the pub tasting sessions are getting pretty good. There is a slight sweetness to the beer, quite honeyed which took the edge off the hops for me, but still a pretty decent beer.","Banbury, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","imdownthepub"
3618,"2008-09-25",3.6,"On cask at The Rake (Borough).  Slightly hazy gold pour with a small frothy off-white head.  Pungent, slightly sour UK hop (now I’m entering this, I see it’s Styrian Goldings - cool, I thought it was Goldings) funk aroma, with a mild oaty grain backing it adequately.  The taste was quite acidic, but unlike the Dreadnought that preceded it, this one worked for me - enough malt profile to prevent me thinking even remotely that this might be a pint of dishwater.  Light bodied for all that, it had a still, slick, solidly acidic mouthfeel, with a long funky finish.  A good Goldings Golden!","Toronto (Harbourfront), Ontario, CANADA","HogTownHarry"
