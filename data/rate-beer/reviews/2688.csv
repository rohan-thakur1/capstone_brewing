2688,"2017-02-22",3.4,"[2/4/17] Draught/Bottle at Extreme Beer Fest in Boston. Dark brown. Bourbon, vanilla, fruits, sweet, malt, caramel, a bit of alcohol.","Tel Aviv, ISRAEL","DSG"
2688,"2017-02-21",3.6,"Poured into a snifter, the appearance was a semi-dark brown color with a little creamy colored head leaving some sticky lacing.
The aroma had some roast, berries, brown sugar and caramel/toffee malts.
The flavor copied the aroma pretty much spot on, leaning to the sweet side and adding some nuts. Subtle nutty to berry aftertaste hitting the finish, somewhat sticky, but slightly acceptable.
On the body, this one was medium bodied with a fair sessionability about it. Mild carbonation and the ABV felt good.
Overall, nicely done strong ale, but seemed to lean towards the English side more. Didnt seem like there were enough or even any hoppiness in the aroma and flavor to be an American styled one.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
2688,"2016-10-08",4.8,"Consistently one of my favorite beers since I first had it in 2009. The fruitiness of the berries excellently accents the malty and bourbony sweet/caramel notes. Wondrous.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"

2688,"2015-03-01",3.5,"Location: Bottle shared at Max and Andys Tasting, 2/28/15, Batch 1


Aroma: The aroma is bourbon, fruit, vanilla, and a bit of spice

Appearance: The pour is dark brown, and has a fairly small head

Flavor: The taste is pretty similar, lots of bourbon, a little fruit, and a little spice

Palate: The body is fairly full, with a good amount of heat still present considering the age

Overall Impression: 
This one seems to have pretty nicely actually. I was surprised that the heat wasnt more gone that it was. The fruitiness adds a nice component.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

2688,"2013-11-27",3.5,"750 purchased at the brewery. Poured into a Duvel tulip. Pours a purple brown color. Fantastic aroma. Mild funk mild bourbon mild berries. All melded together. Mouthfeel is very thin. Taste is very fruity. Bourbon is barely present which I like. Great melding of all flavors. I'd like to get a bit thicker mouthfeel and more Belgian flavor but very good overall.

2688,"2013-09-03",2.8,"Bottle. Pours a dark brown, sweet berries, very thin. Decent malts, some bourbon. Really didnt like this that much.","Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA","TheHOFF43"
2688,"2013-08-12",3.8,"Batch 4.
Aroma is fairly well balanced between dark malt, fruit and barrels. Malt is fairly toasty with some chocolate notes to it. Nice vinous fruit quality with berries and tart cherries. Medium light oak and bourbon notes. 
Pours a very dark brown, pretty much black with a mocha head of moderate size and thickness. The head quickly recedes to the edges where it lingers. 
Flavor is noticeably fruitier than the aroma and the malt note is more chocolatey than roasty. Starts with a slightly sweet but tart berry note with hints of cherries and plums. Moderate chocolate with light roast. Medium low bitterness with no hop flavor. Medium low bourbon and oak note. Moderate alcohol in finish with lingering berries and chocolate. 
Mouthfeel is medium full to full bodied with medium low carbonation. Low tannic astringency with medium alcohol warmth. This definitely has some higher alcohols to it. 
Overall a nice flavorful beer, but it is definitely a winter warmer and leaves you feeling flush. I think they did a great job balancing all the flavors from the fruit, malt and barrels. One thing I might note is that I dont get much yeast character, but Im not sure how much I was expecting.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
2688,"2013-08-02",3.8,"Batch 4
Tasted on 8/1/13 from a capped 750mL bottle obtained in a trade quite a while ago, this one has been in the cellar for a while. Pours an extremely dark, cloudy brown with an average light brown head that slowly recedes to an average collar of lace. The nose is dominated by vanilla, caramel, and toffee bourbon, with dark molasses, burnt brown sugar, some dark roast, and a nice fruity note. The flavor starts off with all of the dark roast up front, moving to the much more pronounced fruity flavor, and finishing with more of the bourbon and dark malt. The body is full with average, smooth carbonation, and a very long fruity and full of dark roast and bourbon finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
2688,"2013-01-09",3.8,"A defined bourbon scent, carmel malts, oak, and slight fruit scent. It has an even better taste. The bourbon blends well with the fruit flavor. I picked up on the sweet malts, berries, plums, and bourbon. The Nor Easter impacts the palate but leaves a pleasant refreshing and relaxing smooth finish.","Steubenville, Ohio, USA","Advocate_Ames"
2688,"2013-01-04",3.8,"Batch 5 Bottle; Pour is dark brown with ruby highlights into this glass - a modest khaki head initial, with average to poor retention and light lacing present. The nose is light bourbon barrel, berries, dark fruit, caramel, cocoa, and bread. The flavor profile is berry dominant initial, surprising actually. It does balance out a bit with dark malts, bread, bourbon notes, albeit lighter - the mouthfeel is smoother than expected for the style, and the abv is masked fairly well here. It loses something near the finish - but its a nice brew.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
2688,"2012-11-10",4.3,"A - Pours a dark black with just a hint of brown and a finger of frothy khaki colored head. The head fades down at a normal pace leaving behind some lacing.

S - Aroma is a mix of roasted caramel and chocolate malts, vanilla, oak, Bourbon, berries, dark fruit, a touch of spices, and some booze.

T - Starts off with some caramel and chocolate malts with some vanilla, dark fruit, and berries. Through the middle, the oak and Bourbon come through alongside some more berries and dark fruit and a touch of spices. The finish is a mix of sweet dark fruits and berries, vanilla, oak, Bourbon, caramel malts, a bit of spices, and some booze.

M - Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth with a sweet and warming finish.

D - Very drinkable. The bourbon adds some nice complexity around a bit malty base beer.","Waltham, Massachusetts, USA","ngeunit1"
2688,"2012-09-01",3.1,"Trade with Bobertkuekn. Black pour, thick, moderately high head, very nice lacing. Aroma is very light, and very reminiscent of a sour ale. Flavor is lightly sour, not sweet, relatively uncomplex, slightly vinous. Light mouthfeel, but not thin. The alcohol is completely hidden. Very hard to pin this beer down because it really is different from anything Ive had. Essentially it comes off as a light sour ale, with some subtle notes of wine and oak. Find very little if any bourbon in this. Rating is somewhat low, but I could see warming up to this over time. An interesting brew.","Bothell, Washington, USA","michaelinwa"
2688,"2012-08-22",3.8,"2010 Vintage. Enjoyed in a wine glass at near fridge temperature. 

A - No head at all. Murky plum brown with nice alcohol legs on the swirl. 

S - Raisins, figs, brown sugar and other very sweet dark fruits. Maybe dried figs is more close to what this smells like. Small maltiness but not a lot of bourbon as I would expect. 

T - Very malty up front. Sort of thick in the malt taste with the middle being the start of a box full of raisins. But theres this acetic funky lacto sort of taste in the center. Its unsuprising and not what I was expecting. Finish is oaky, hints of bourbon and some vanilla with a sweet departure of tastes.

M - 15% carbonation on the mouth swish, medium body and funky sweet solidly sippable drinkable finish.

O - This is a great beer. Enjoyable. Solid. Wishing there was a bit more carbonation.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
2688,"2012-08-19",3.6,"-- Poured a clear, nearly opaque dark brown. One finger to half finger of light brown head. Good head retention and good lacing associated with this as drinking. Lots of spotty lacing. 

S-- Did not expect tartness to this at all. Quite odd. Little bit of a sour/ tart smell to this. A bit like a sweet tart. Elderberry evident off the bat and in the back of the nose get touches of bourbon. Grape and bubble gum in the nose as well. 

T-- More sour and tartness. Grape, bubblegum, oak, bits of bourbon in the back but very soft. Thought a La Chouffe but a sour version of it. Interesting. 

M-- Light and bubbly, has a very clean, crisp and dry finish to this. Medium feel and medium carbonation. Pretty easy to drink really. Once got over the tart smell and taste a pretty easy beer to drink. Alcohol well hidden. 

O-- Not what I expected but good. Well hidden 12% beer. Rich and full but light. Am guessing the triple fermentation to that. Touches of grape and bourbon make this quite interesting to me.","AUSTRALIA","fletchfighters"
2688,"2012-07-14",3.7,"Batch 4 bottle from Josh - thanks!  Pours extremely dark brown (nearly black) with a dark tan head that fades out to a slick.  Aroma is sour fruit of some type up front with the bourbon and sweet malt, including raisin and perhaps some spice, toward the finish.  Taste is an interesting combination of sour (but not infected) fruit with heavier malt, spices, and a clean, but slightly biting bourbon character into the finish.  Mouthfeel is light and clean.  Nice beer.","San Diego, California, USA","peteinSD"

2688,"2012-02-03",3.8,"Nor Easter pours a little bit like a stout.  Its dark.  A very dark brown.  A nice frothy 2 finger head is poured and has nice retention.  Now I was expecting to get wowed by the smell of this beer for some reason.  The mixture that it says on the front of the bottle got me ready for something awesome.  Ale with elderberries aged in bourbon barrels.  Yum sounds fantastic but what I got was very muted.  The Elderberries gave off the biggest smell.  They were sweet.  But everything else like the ripe dark fruit, caramel, and bourbon was lingering there but just small.

Taste was more of the same for me.  Muted.  That doesnt mean it wasnt good though.  The bourbon woody flavor definitely came through more on the taste.  The berries are there and make for a kind of sour and bitter combination.  Under all of that caramel and dark fruits sit on the bottom.  Mouthfeel was really nice.  Thick and smooth.  Silky and sits in your mouth.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","drunkenpolack"

Poured into a tulip. Appearance is dark brown with a tan head and some light lacing. Nose is tart cherries, berries, oak, light vanilla, and some roast. Fairly complex but I think what I had was too young and hadnt quite integrated yet. The taste is similar with roast and tart fruits. Really nice feel with a bit of tart character and a good body. Drinks well now and this should age supremely.

2688,"2011-04-11",4.3,"750ml, just capped, batch no 4.  Nose has some mild Weizenbock notes under the heavy caramel and bourbon/oak/vanilla and alcohol.  Delicious milk chocolate, prunes, brown sugar and molasses.  Really great malt complexity up front, and one of the few big barrel-aged beers Ive had that really, really benefits from the process.  Pours dark mahogany with a rocky light brown head.  Taste is tart and low bittersweetness, dries out, but with sour/tartness remains much longer.  Berries override the mocha, Holunder over the vanilla, with dark cherries taking the lead.  Viscous, dense, creamy mouthfeel, something of a Rodenbach with a woodystrong ale.  Alcohol feels more like 8% than twelve, soft and complex malt with an underlying ripcurrent of roast and spices, lesser grape with raisins and slight must.  Winy, smooth medium-full body.  Just fantastic as a sipper, some very strong sour cherry/berry/fruits up front but undercut by a whole swath of balancers, sort of an upside-down take (with the sour prominent and the roast and barrel as milder accents) and all the more surprising for it.

4.5 A: Pretty damn close to black in color. Two fingers of super creamy tan head. Pretty good retention considering the ABV and lots of lacing. Very nice here.

4.5 S: Great balance among the components. Bourbon is right in my ideal strength level and complements the beer rather than dominating it. Bourbon lends a boozy, leather, vanilla, and oak component. The strange fruity smell must be the elderberries. Sweet caramel, toffee, plum, and dark cherry.

3.0 T: The taste is a big step down from the appearance and smell. Its really lacking depth at the malt level and the body is too light. Elderberry tartness is strong as is the bourbon components. The caramel and toffee are just about removed. This tastes like a watered down bourbon with elderberries added. Alcohol is extremely well hidden especially given the light body. Disappointing here.

3.0 M: Lightish body. Too damn light and really brought down the taste. Good moderate carbonation and somewhat creamy.

A-Body is an opaque dark brown hue. Pours with a 1/2 finger creamy off-white head-has good rentention the whole way through but little lacing left behind in the glass.

S-Elderberry, raisin, over-ripe plum, cinnamon sugar, nose is very dark- a hint of bourbon as well.

T- Cinnamon sugar is the most dominant upfront-a slight dried (dark) fruitiness comes through as well. Flavor is sweet and overripened-very similar to an RIS that focuses on dark fruit. Hints of anise and licorice are also noticable in the flavor. A slight alcohol heat lingers on the palate.

M- Medium-tingly carbonation with a quite thick heavy weight body.

D- This is much like an IRS that overemphasizes the dark fruity flavors. Overripened fruit everywhere- its thick, heavy, and wintery as well. What I do enjoy about it is the extra flavor of cinnamon sugar. Decent overall-but probably my least favorite of the captain lawrence lineup so far.

Nose is what I like..deep, somewhat sweet tartness from the elderberries, evident bourbon with soft vanilla edges, with cakey chocolate malt nose riding behind.  Somewhat tart, tannic, and vinous intro to flavors carrying along with it a bit of non-descript malt profile with maybe hints of chocolate and very slight whispers of charred wood.  Alcohol felt in the warmth but not tasted.  Grapey, vinous finish.  The mouthfeel has definite bourbon barrel influences as its rather soft, though its nicely accented by the delicate tartness of the fruit that combines with the oak influence to sour things up a little bit.  I think it could use with a more aggressive malt structure though...or something a little deeper, more chocolate, a heavier accent on the smoke maybe, even some more malt sweetness...but thats just nitpicking or trying to compare it to cuvee de tomme or something, which it isnt though it does remind me of cuvee a little bit.

Its almost a stout-sour hybrid without the potentially overwhelming qualities of either.

2688,"2010-01-20",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 21, 2010 Bottle shared after the Bruery Reserve Society Initiation.  Pours very dark brown with a small tan head and a little lacing.  Aroma is roasty and sour, with funk, dark fruit, and vanilla.  Flavor is also roasty and really tart, surprisingly.  Some nice complexity in there - some sweet caramel malt pokes through the tartness, and there are vinous notes, oak, vanilla, and coffee flavors in there.  12% ABV?  No way!  This does not have the syrupiness or the booziness that Id expect from a winter warmer of that strength.  Body is medium-full and fairly dry and acidic.  Got to give it a bump up on the palate for achieving that effect, since it seems like it would be tough to accomplish in a beer like this.  Overall, this is good despite the oddities to it.
EDIT: Had this again 2/21/2010.  Crazy beer that seems to have a lot of bottle-to-bottle variation.  This time it wasnt nearly as tart, but was very funky on the aroma, like feet.  Despite the inconsistency, I like this beer.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

2688,"2010-01-03",3.1,"I dont like the cold. I like even less the freezing horrid storms that Old Man Winter brings; the NorEaster. Once you know one, you love them no more, the frosty romanticism frozen solid in the pit of your stomach as fear, loathing, and gloom looms heavy upon your soul. Sunny Florida, replete with sandy beaches, skin-replenishing humidity, tiki bars, and surf is where life is truly at. Dont agree with me? I knew there was something wrong with you, but its ok. There is always hope. Whether they be honest fans of the crotchety ol NorEaster or just inserting a little tongue-in-cheek humor, Captain Lawrence Brewing out of Pleasantville, NY offers a Winter Warmer aptly named NorEaster. Maybe its a ward to warn off the real deal? Either way, it is hopefully far more enjoyable and much less dangerous than his bigger and badder brother.


His depths are stormy browns and blacks, swirling beneath patches of khaki clouds while a thick ring lingers. As the skies prepare to open up and rain hell and high water upon winters hapless denizens, the NorEaster Winter Warmer releases its own storm of candied fruit ala fruitcake, licorice root, fig, and dates, pits included of course. The pits offer a deep earthy nuttiness while alcohol offers an eye-opening slap right at the end. Im awake; really I am. The abrupt hit of alcohol heat also offers a compromise of sweet warmth which blends with a gruit of brown spices and wood. Certainly more inviting than his blustery brother, I dive deep in to the approaching storm and find a welcoming embrace of brown spices, figs, dates, and dry wood steeped in alcohol warmth while a pervading sweetness prevents her palate from completely poaching mine. Each quaff finishes with an assertive dryness, almost like a dry rub of brown spices, wood, and pits atop my tongue. The dark fruits are unfortunately much less prominent in the palate than they were in the nose, though there is a gentle undercurrent of dry European chocolates that were not present in the nose but are present in his palate. Are those red apples sprinkled with cinnamon? Before I have a chance to discern, they are gone. A few more quaffs, and there is nothing more to find. The NorEaster Winter Warmer from Captain Lawrence Brewing has blown through, blustered about, and then fizzled away.


Not too bad, but nothing ground-breaking or inspiring. Id certainly quaff another, but in the world of winter brews, he is like many of his fellow brothers and sisters of the winter storm.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

2688,"2009-02-03",4.5,"Style and Glass: American Strong; Trappist, Snifter
ABV, Volume & Calories: 12 % in 25.4 fl oz. estimated at 400 C
Purchased at: Joe Canals Lawrenceville, NJ for $14.49

Aroma: Very much the impression of bourbon or whiskey. Alcohol, smoke, and fire await. Like a fireplace going in the neighborhood on a cold winter night.

Visuals: Very nice packaging, tasteful, inviting. Thin white head hangs on indefinitely, over a dark black oily body. Lacing is intricate and sticky.

Taste: Like cough syrup  itll cure what ails you. Thick, sugary, with a surprising control of the 12% ABV. Warms immediately. Woody, oaky, and smoky. More of a smoked german sausage than italian or polish spicyness. Like biting into a cupcake  very thick. Tasty! Cherry, chocolate, and caramel.

Palate:  Warming throughout. Starts thick and dull, no crispness throughout, and not really looking for it. Middle is spongy and drying, and finishes long, smoky, and a little spicy.

Overall: Like other CLs Ive tried, this is very much about the smoke, and like others Ive tried, CL seems to do it right  not like eating a sausage, but it would compliment it very well. Delicious, expertly balanced, and neither cloying nor overpowering, which is astounding considering the ABV.

1/21/2009:  Nor Easter Winter Warmer has a nice, dark ruby-brown with a substantial, beige head.  The aroma is slightly oxidized, but has a really nice dark fruit and raisin aroma.  The flavor is great, but difficult to describe.  It isnt roasty, but has a unique dark fruitiness (black raspberry), is moderately sweet, and has a somewhat semi-sweet dark chocolateness to it.  The finish is slightly dry with some light woody/oak characteristics and just a hint of vanilla.  This beer has come together really well and is quite excellent.  It definitely has a dark flavor with plenty of berry characteristics.  There is also a good vanilla flavor.  I really like this beer.  It is quite unique and impressive.

The aroma really smells like bourbon soaked berries dipped in some chocolate.  It all melds together very well, with the bourbon not too overpowering in the nose.

Sweet dark chocolate and fruits dominate the front end of the taste, with the bourbon and oak presence really growing into a fairly dry finish.  The bourbon leaves a definite burn on the back of the throat as it goes down.

I was very suprised with the flavor because it had almost as much bourbon barrel flavor as Black OPS, and just like that beer it had a wonderful creamy malt base.

the aroma is full of bourbon barrel woodiness... its very smooth and pleasant. also noted are molasses, chocolate, caramelized sugar, vanilla, eucalyptus and mint. the palate is malty and sweet yet the sugar level is not an issue. lots of roasty malt in the flavor mixes with cocoa, dark raisins, fruity sourness, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla oakiness and just enough bourbon to make a difference. theres a mild bitterness on an otherwise smooth finish. as it warms it picks up a slight sourness which makes it more well balanced than it already was. medium body with a luscious mouth feel.

The nose is very strong with bourbon everywhere, with a faintly detectable fruitiness in there for good measure. Mouthfeel is full, a bit prickly, finishes slick. Huge notes of vanilla and bourbon tend to crowd out the other flavors that are there, particularly the berry.

2688,"2008-12-19",4.2,"Batch 2, aged for nearly a year.  Mahogany in color, with glints of chestnut at the edges, the body is topped with a swirly film and a minimal, micro-bubble edge.  Tiny, scattered spots of lacing mark the glass.  The aroma is rich and complex.  Semi-sweet cocoa and scorched caramel lay the malty groundwork, while smoked dark fruits, red berries, vanilla, toasted oak, and a kiss of sour mash bourbon finish things off.  Simply put, this brew smells divine.  Flavors are similar, dark fruits asserting themselves a bit more, perhaps.  Fig comes to the forefront, accompanied by the cocoa and caramel, while the berries take a turn towards sour.  Vanilla and Kentucky bourbon are subtly infused throughout.  Light carbonation makes for a silky, velvety body that drinks incredibly easily for a brew of this stature.  This is an outstanding beer, and one that I surely need to stock up on for the future.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

2688,"2008-09-13",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2009 Draught, vintage 2007. Pours opaque black, thin tan head. Nose is honestly all bourbon - heavy on oak, vanilla, alcohol. Taste is similar - the beer itself seems completely lost in the bourbon. Along with the bourbon, oak, and vanilla, you get a hint of roasty malt and the barest hint of cocoa and a dose of sharp alcohol, but nothing that pulls the beer out of the bourbon barrel. Not much in the way of subtlety here. 
7/4/6/3/15

Rerate, 08 vintage - numbers reflect this version. Still tons of bourbon, but complemented by a sweeter malt character, with more of a cocoa  and brown sugar presence underneath. Increase in score probably comes as much from freshness as anything, but the bourbon character and the beer itself both seem to be brighter and more clear in this version.

Notes of creamy chocolate, salt and sweet liquorice, brown sugar, molasses, dark cherries, sweet dark grapes, blue berries, wild strawberries, prunes, figs, rum raisins, vanilla, bourbon, butter, cardamom, mild nutmeg, mild white pepper and of course a touch of elderberries.

2688,"2008-04-29",4.1,"Bottle. Nearly the entire 750 in fact. Took me  2 1/2 hours. Wow. Aroma was relatively heavy on the bourbon, with lots of roasted malt as well, alcoholic/fruity sweetness, probably bourbon related, but of a different nature than straight bourbon. Flavor was super, super complex, largely as the bottle describes, with vinous notes from the elderberries, Belgian yeast notes sneaking in in the background, and a bourbon that added both sweet notes and dry notes at the same time. A truly unique brew that brought together so many different aspects of brewing and aging. Went from this utter complexity, to bourbon dominated, to roasted malt dominated over the course of 2 1/2 hours of drinking and warming. the elderberry notes as fruit faded after the initial burst, but the vinousness, and to an extent tartness, they added remained, to varying degrees, throughout. These notes also worked well with the woody notes, which I havent mentioned to this point, but surely if taken away, the beer would completely change. I must say even over 2 1/2 hours, the bottle has me rather buzzed, and clearly I was unable to keep comprehensive notes throughout. Overall, though, a brew whose excellence combined with uniqueness makes it a must try.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

My throat was warmed after just a few sips.  Unfortunately, this was too bourbon-dominated for my liking.

2688,"2008-02-20",4.2,"In short: A big, VERY BIG, fruity sticky monster of a digestive beer.  Excellent.
How: Bottle 750ml Batch #1 (1 year 3 months old) and Batch #2 (3 months old).  Tasting session with Montreal crew.
The look: Brown black body with a small tan head
In long: Big sticky body with just about all the dark fruits flavours you can think of and then some.  Plums, figs, prunes, blackberries, etc.  Also something that reminded me of concentrate grape juice before adding the four cans of water.  A light chocolate presence and some port wine notes.  Alcohol extremely well hidden.  Describing a beer by its dark fruity flavours makes it sounds like one among many but really theres something quite original and unique about the taste of this one that I cant put into words.  Batch #1 has a stronger barrel presence while Batch #2 has is more fruit focussed.  To me they were equally excellent.  It may only be on its second year but already the Nor Easter is one of the best winter traditions.  We need more winters and more Nor Easters.

2688,"2008-02-17",3.8,"Opaque dark brown pour with a certain reddish tint. not the most beautiful colour, more or less like liquid medjool dates. Quickly departing head. Enticing, rich, sugary, bourbony nose. Ive had the chance to try batch #2 quite a few times over the last few months and just yesterday, we compared #1 to #2. I must say I prefer the #2. The fruitiness was far more forward, vital, so was a certain smokiness. More or less, it felt both more complex and fresher. This brew plays two games at once: the one of decadence through sheer complexity and the one of incomprehension through unadulterated originality. Both batches are still relatively comparable and can be counted among todays most originals products on the planet. Flavours include, but are not limited to : blueberry, strawberry, fruit cake, prunes, chocolate, vanilla, cinnamon. The bourbon influence is indeed quite noticeable, but amidst the fruitiness, you lose most of the heavy alcohol/sticky corn notes. Its too juicy for that. Alcohol is indeed warming, but not favorising headaches. So, a very sweet brew indeed, but enough contemplative nuances to be appealing. As a late nightcap, its as fine as most top shelves beers. For a 12% behemoth, it remains rather drinkable, but frankly, I dont think I could drink a whole bottle even if I dedicated 3 hours to the task. Do I enjoy it? Yes, in the right context, but I dont feel a pull toward having another one the following day. Still, Im quite impressed by that product.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

2688,"2008-01-26",4.0,"Batch 2; Sampled January 2008
Pours with a frothy, initially three-finger thick, pale cocoa tinged, tan colored head that leaves some light lacing on the sides of the glass as it subsides.  The beer is quite opaque (even when held up to the light) and is pretty close to being black in color.  The aroma has a nice, concentrated fruit note to it that reminds me of rum soaked raisins, a bright, though dried berry note and a bit of estery banana.  Underneath this, and in fact contributing to the initially noticed rum note, is a noticeable barrel influence;  Aromas of vanillin, spicy wood, butterscotch-like oak and a finish of light bourbon notes are all noticeable, but at a really nice level.  Unlike so many Bourbon barrel aged beers the brewer has kept the barrel notes at a secondary, almost subtle level here, though it does contribute lots of aromatics to the nose of this brew.  Much of the fruitiness and some subtle spiciness (made more subtle by the more noticeable barrel notes) seems contributed by a Belgian-type yeast strain.

Sweet, fruity flavors greet my taste buds up front.  The beer is actually a bit lighter in heft than the fruitiness might suggest; this definitely is a rich sipping brew though.  A soft, almost velvety, creaminess accompanies the up front sweetness and continues to envelope the mouth as the beer passes through.  A light, tickle of carbonation provides some structure, but does not disrupt the creaminess.  Fruit flavors of prunes, raisins, and concentrated berries yield to soft oak notes of vanillin and buttery oak.  More towards the finish the spicy oak character and subtle Bourbon notes provide a bit of a bite and a touch of warming character.  For how dark this brew is, it has an awful small amount of roast character; it makes me wonder if much of the color came from the elderberries.  Still there is some roasty notes in the finish that contribute a touch of chalky, dark grain astringency, notes of deeply toasted bread crust and even some burnt grain acidity.  Perhaps a lot of the otherwise easily noticed dark grain character is just well balanced / hidden by the sweet fruit notes and barrel character.

Interestingly, when I suck in a lot of air after taking a sip I really get a strong, warming alcohol note, not unlike straight Bourbon.  As the brew warms up a bit (coinciding with my second pour of this brew) from its initial 60°F / 15°C, the oak character becomes more noticeable; strangely, or not so considering Bourbon gets most of its flavor from oak, the Bourbon character does not become more pronounced.  Still the barrel notes are held well in check by the other flavor notes that are happening in this beer.  Upon further reflection though, I think that it was the piquant sweetness that has become tempered, and not the jump in barrel flavors; the sweetness is not quit so much now, even if it was never cloying, instead the beer is much more integrated, mellow somehow and just plain harmonious.

What I really like about this brew is that the Bourbon barrel was really held in check; it provides noticeable character to both the aroma and flavor, but I dont feel like it drown out any of the base beers character (which is certainly the case with 90% of the barrel / oak beers being made right now).  The sweetness without the bourbon / oak character would more than likely be overwhelming and detracting, but as couple here with the Bourbon and oak notes it provides a nice balance that really keeps the barrel flavors from becoming too obtrusive and overwhelming.  This was a very good beer in the first, cooler pour, but once it warmed up it has become much more harmonious, more balanced and really just a great drinking experience; the fact that I drank a full 750ml bottle of this brew definitely improved the overall experience.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

2688,"2008-01-11",4.0,"Poured from a 750mL Bottle at the brewery. This is a preliminary review. Pours a maple and balsamic pan sauce, charged with an angry muddy sea form. Aroma confuses lightly with bold caramels, generic fruit and gobs of vinous quality. Flavor develops as very complex and fruity. Comes first as heavy in the caramel department, with unique strong syrups and sweetness. But, not too sweet. Just in that expressing alcohols, but not overwhelming the palate sweet. And speaking of alcohol, not so hot for twelve, which makes it real enjoyable. After moving out of maybe a confused dark sugar phase and behaving like something that reminisces of Lost Abbey Old Viscosity, this beer straggles from the pack by presenting a full profile of the bourbon barrel and the fruit, mingling together in unique union. Lots of berry and jam, but more directed towards the seeds and extraneous pulp, which is okay, because I wouldnt want a sweet, pie-heavy flavor to develop. Then the growling, mature oaky bourbon, but in no way overwhelming. Balance and dryness seem to be missing, but since Im not overwhelmed by alcohol and sweetness, so its alright.

Pours opaque, dark brown, with mahogany edging.
An aggresive pour releases barely any head, with only traces of medium to large bubbles of tan rising to the surface.
Aromatics are decidely bourbon-laced and boozy.
Bakers chocolate, dark fruit, and some light char step forward as it warms.
Mouthfeel is sticky, chewy, and lightly syrupy, with carbonation lacking.
The pallet is layered with ripe berries, whiskey, dark chocolate, and charred oak.
A complex and fruity vineousity lingers as the bourbon and mild smoke fade.
Finishes with plenty of warming alcohol, bourbon, and vanilla.

The juicy essence of the elderberries plays a complimentary role to the bold flavor profiles of bourbon and chocolate, and does not make the beer scream ""Im a fruit beer!"".
Im not really getting any Belgian character however, and if the carbonation was better, this beer  would be improved.

Retronasal coffee milk & fusels. Creamy texture at first, then in the end, it gets wry short of revolting. Theres something awkward about this beer(s).

This was about as close to wine as beer gets in my experience. I now understand the term vinous. This is a dark ale with a stout like color and consistency but with a belgian flavor that veers into dark red wine territory. Quite enjoyable but I think I would have appreciated it more if it wasnt 92 degrees outside.

The molten bourbon still dominates, perhaps a bit harshly, but it supports a colorful pallet.  Candied raisins, chocolate liqueur, mild licorice.

2688,"2007-06-10",3.4,"Thanks Todd for the chance to try these Captain Lawrence brews, I will be looking for more in the future. My #200 BIG BEER: Bottle and served in my Unibroue tulip: Pours a deep ruddy brown topped by a long lasting frothy tan head and excellent lacing. The nose displays a fruity element which I guess is the elderberry and some raisin and apple esters; a bourbon barrel influence (vanilla, oak, booze); hint of leather, tobacco and mocha malts vapours and even a note of peat-bog moss. The flavor profile starts with a quick punch of acidic and ripened fruits followed quickly by vanilla and toffee sweetness. The finish is sadly dominated by the alcoholic nature of the combination of bourbon barrel and base big beer. Just raw, hot and overwhelming to the point all finesse is lost. The mouth feel also suffers from powerful alcohol abuse, very dry on the finish,  peppery too. I would like to see what about 2 or 3 years of aging would do for this brew, for now I cant really recommend this beer unless to cellar.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Good traders, I guess! So here I am, having drank it the first day out of the barrels, finally opening a bottle and rating it months after others.

Bourbony peat aroma, blueberries and jam, slight saltiness. Im not getting much out of the aroma. Pours very very dark brown with almost no head. Chestnut and almond in the taste, bourbon and fruits, fairly complex and very big. A little too caramelly in the finish is kinda boring. Still very hot, though for 12% bourbon barrelled beer, thats hardly surprising. A fun beer, though I must admit I dont really regret trading away all but 2 of my bottles. Though this should age nicely, I dont see that much more interest developing over the years. Certainly doesnt hold a candle to the wine barrel Smoke from the Oak, or Cuvee de Castleton, in this reviewers humble opinion.","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

Additionally, a bit of smokiness or charred leaf, with some alcohol vapors stinging the nose.  Flavor initialy of prune, molasses, and alcohol, like a rum/brandy soaked Christmas pudding.

Well balanced and fairly complex, a nice brew thats more than the name winter warmer implies.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

2688,"2007-05-02",4.2,"Poured a very dark brown color with lighter rim and a small beige head.  The aroma is sweet, fruity, doughy, yeasty, and notes of bourbon.  All in great balance.  The flavor too was a perfect balance of fruity malt and bourbon.  great warmth.  Medium to full bodied.  The aroma had some tartness to it.","Nesconset, New York, USA","goldtwins"
2688,"2007-05-02",3.5,"(750ml bottle, thanks kmweaver) Medium tan head atop cola black body.  Aroma is medium sweet, vanilla/bourbon, oak, light blueberry, caramel.  Taste is moderately sweet, berry, caramel, some Bourbon.  Medium-full body, low carbonation.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2688,"2007-04-30",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 20, 2008 My Bottom Line:
Wise elderberry vinosity teams up with an equally sagacious bourbon/vanilla sweetness to render even more complexity and flavor to the chocolatey roastiness of this serene strong ale. Of the utmost class, this fascinating masterpiece of Scott Vassaros should get as much attention as Tomme Arthurs own heavenly creations. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A lasting sheet of foam garnishes the mauve blackness.
-Its fruitiness (elderberries, black grapes, blackberries, etc.) is simply sexy.
-Alcohol is always well hidden, while contributing to the soulwarming experience.
-Subtle leafy hops decorate the finish.
-This is so drinkable for a beer this size!
-The licorice and vanilla apport of the bourbon barrel is well placed.
-Batch #1 was as enthralling as Batch #2, even though the barrels have been changed. Mesmerizing.

Not one overpowers the other.  This is a slow sipper, as in hours, and in that regard I could not finish it.  I would want to share another bottle, and I would like to try it again.  Low carbonation, woody, quite complex, with a bit of sourness in the finish.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"

Flavor pulls out woody vanilla bourbon notes that lie on a bed of boozy berries.  Had a light bitterness rounding this off to keep the malt in check.  Full bodied, medium carbonation, warming finish.  Good stuff now, but age will really pull it together well.  Thanks for sharing Ken","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","scraff"

2688,"2007-04-27",3.9,"Good sized nice dense head of creamy and very fine bubbles.  Light brown in color and hangs around for a while.  Wow, potent aroma with lots of dark ripe fruit (cherry), vanilla, butterscotch, bourbon, sweet malts and caramel.  Very dark bown in color.  Rich and powerful flavor with a bourbon kick that is a little too noticable.  Needs a little more sticky malts to take up some of the alcohol.  VERY warming all the way down.  12% that kicks you in the butt!  Malty and sweet with more dark fruit (prunes) vanilla, butter and a dry and vinuous palate.  It is going to be tough to finish this bottle.  Finishes dry and very hot.  A pretty damn good brew.  Wonderful up front and needs to settle a bit and lose some of the alcohol prominence.","Robbinsville, New Jersey, USA","Dorwart"
2688,"2007-04-24",4.0,"On tap at Mugs. Dark brown, almost black in color with a medium sized tan head. Aroma of bourbon, vanilla, sweet malt, caramel and a vinous smell that most be the elderberries. Flavor starts of mildly sweet and malty with the bourbon coming on lightly along with some oak, vanilla and again that wine-like flavor that I will attribute to the elderberries. Very good and should be excellent after sitting in the bottle for a while.","Nutley, New Jersey, USA","jimmack"

Aromas are dark fruits, bourbon, what I guess are elderberries, yeasty, and brown sugary malt goodness. Flavor, especially as it warms, is very sweet with berries and bourbon leading the way, but overall very well balanced.  Thank you, ill have another!!","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"
2688,"2007-04-05",4.0,"Color is dark, reddish brown body with a dark, tan head.  The aroma is very plum and prune-filled, yet with a nice balance of sweet lactose and roasted, vanilla malts.  A little astringency in the nose as well.  iT is certainly warming, and it is very delicious.  Im not sure what to make fo the boisterous, bourbon-burning sensation in my throat - I wasnt quite expecting such a punch.  The flavor is good, though, filled with bourbon, yet it has a pleasant earthiness to it.  I would like to try this one in a few years, for sure.","Denver, Colorado, USA","apoptosis"

2688,"2007-04-01",4.4,"750ml bottle acquired in trade with jjpm74 (thanks!). Bottle labeled batch 1. Poured a dark, dark brown color with a large sized off white head. Aromas of wood, nuts, chocolate, roast, light vanilla, and a very light berry/fruitiness. Every once and a while, I also thought I was getting some pine. Tastes of bourbon, vanilla, dark fruits, brown sugar, and had an all around vinous characteristic as well. Alcohol well hidden (Im pretty sure Ill be feeling buzzed after drinking this one myself though!).","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"

2688,"2007-03-24",3.9,"UPDATED: MAR 2, 2011 Vertical tasting November 2010 - 
Batch 4 - Soft bourbon - lots of cocoa and bittersweet chocolate.  Softly herbal but the floral not is quite subdued.  Loads of bourbon and soft tartness.
Batch 3 - Oily and oaky but not all that bourbony.  A touch of barrel-aged wildness.  Softly sweet and a little bit fruity.  Oaky with a kiss of light peppery flavour.
Batch 2 - Softly sweet with a lot of dried raisin character.  Tartness with a little bit of dried fruit as well.  A touch of cherry and cocoa.  Mmmm - favourite of the lot.
Batch 1 - Deeply cocoaish on the nose.  Ethanol and a lot of cocoa as well.  Some plumminess.  Fairly oaky still although the oak is restrained.  Soft maltiness.  Its aging nicely.

750 ml bottle.  Batch 002.  Very dark black beer with a thick tan head.  Aroma is lovely.  Rich sweet aroma, spicy and lightly vineous.  A lot of dark maltiness, red wine and a bit of bourbony character.  A bit boozy, but the warmth really adds a lot of interesting back notes to the beer.  Lean body with a bit of soft dark chocolate.  Some molasses and some burnt sugar.  A little bit of woodiness.  I like this a whole lot more than I did the first time around.  Rich, complex and tasty.

Tap at Hop Devil Grill.  Very deep brown/black beer with a light tan head.  Aroma is deep and sweet, showing dark malts, cardamom, molasses and a touch of roastiness as well.  Light peppery booziness on the nose with clove and blackberry, but the body seems a little bit thin and its a bit too boozy for my tastes.  Quite light and peppery.  Probably my least favourite of the CL brews.  I suspect a year or so will improve this quite a bit.

2688,"2007-03-20",4.4,"Draft. Small, big bubbled head. Aroma is vineous and mostly bourbon. Theres a nice smoky flavor to go along with some vanilla. Theres a lot of grape in the flavor, maybe too much so. This stuff will age very gracefully. After reading the description, the flavor is elderberries, not grapes. Who knew? This is one kick ass brew though with plenty of punch.","Astoria, New York, USA","Eyedrinkale"
2688,"2007-03-16",4.0,"You know, Ive never really cared for anything this brewery has made. I mean, not bad.. but never even close to justifying the pricetag. Finally this is about to change. Cloudy dark brown with a moderate head, good lacing and retention. Aroma is bourbon and vanilla barrel with chocolate, darker fruits, caramel, enough hops to keep it from being overly sweet. Throw in those berries too. Heavy body, some alcohol in the finish but hard to imagine 12%. Elderberries (although I have no idea what one is, I can tell they give it a distinctive flavor..) really made this one interesting. Only real complaint is that bourbon is a little too much. Otherwise, really nice job keeping a big beer balanced and interesting. As Borat would say, ""Great success.""","California, USA","ABUSEDGOAT"
2688,"2007-03-16",4.1,"750.  Very dark brown in color with a very small tan head.  Aroma is huge notes of  chocolate, a moderate amount of dark fruit, and notes of oak, vanilla, and bourbon. Good amount of alcohol in the aroma also.  Taste is very full bodied, chocolate, elderberries/plums/raisins, light notes of pipe tobacco, vanilla, wood, with a moderate amount of alcohol and  fruit in the finish.  Really enjoyed this one for #900, and during a nor easter to boot, but some age will make this even better. This beer is still pretty green.","Largo, Florida, USA","hophead75"
2688,"2007-03-13",4.0,"Blackened purple with borders of chestnut. Creamy beige head quickly scatters, but remains tightly packed at the edges Jammy and vinous nose of blackcurrants, licorice and chocolate mousse. Whispers of iron, yogurt, charred wood, nougat and vanilla mirror one another in intensity. Trace presence of alcohol. Dense and lush carbonation. Bouncy nutty-oak lays the foundation that supports a tightly flavored and notably vinous mixture of mashed plums and mincemeat. Ensuing rush of clean alcohol and poignant, yet restrained, char gracefully penetrates the concentration of bright and supple fruitiness. Charred wood unites with the malts to generate a burnt fruitcake and chocolaty effect. Twang of leather and iron holds the sweetness at bay, as does the understated but well-defined char which bristles beneath the gooey residuals. Body is generously packed with polished hop flavors that coincide with the gently coarse bitterness which imparts ample body structure and helps lighten the thick yeast remnants.  Snug salty tannins and spicy char combat and enhance the beefy malts and perpetually-dense fruitiness. Resounding softness tempers the slight medicinal astringency. Finishes chewy and taffy-like, with a beautifully structured maltiness combined with a succulently-fresh fruit, peppery alcohol  and brightly estery accompaniment. Pretty impressive as is, but this ought to be mind-bogglingly good with a year or two of age on it. Thanks for the bottle, puzzl!","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Oaky and woody flavors balance well with the full malt and fruit flavors.  Tons of chocolate, some roast, light to moderate bourbon, slight oaky buttery wood and vanilla.

A slight underlying sweetness of raisins is present, yet a roastyness is evident throughout. Lots of boozeyness, slight burn on the throat.
