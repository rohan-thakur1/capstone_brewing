2423,"2015-06-22",4.2,"Sample from cparles, thanks! 

Appearance: Clear bright orange-golden with nice alcohol legs. 

Aroma: Toffee and molasses at first followed by bright apples, bright tropical fruits (papaya?) and a bit of alcohol. 

Taste: Wow! Its really sweet and quite tart as well. The toffee (rather than the usual brown sugar or caramel) combined to the papaya / tropical fruits produces a unique, complex and explosive mix. The caramelized apples are there as well helping the balance. Theres also some alcohol and a mild spiciness (cinnamon). 

Palate: Full body. Thick and oily. Warming finish with a nice tartness. Mouth coating sweetness. 

Overall: Big bold and decadent ice cider. Really sweet and quite tart with a rather unique flavor profile. Very tasty stuff. Among the best of the style. Loved it.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

2423,"2015-04-26",3.8,"2012 Vintage. 375mL bottle, pours a beautiful clear dark amber with a tiny head. Nose brings out loads of treacle toffee, caramel apple and brown sugar. Flavour is intensely sweet, with caramelized apples, candied sugar, and a subtle tartness. Much more sweet than most other ice ciders, entering cloying territory but not detracting. Also more tart than most ice ciders. But also very complex. A unique one for sure. Excellent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

2423,"2014-05-26",4.3,"Colour me speechless, what did just hit me? What kind of unearthly brew is this? A magnificent mix of apple cider, liqueur and dessert wine! It pours a beautiful, crystal clear orange body, this looks like the nectar of the Gods. No head. The aroma is strong, sweet and acidic and has some lovely notes of both fermented and fresh apples, and a nice whiff of alcohol in the back. The flavour is an everlasting intense overdose of concentrated pure apple, with subtle hints of vanilla in the back. Its incredible that a brew that mainly tastes apples still can be this complex and layered. The taste is heavy sweet and the sweetness is perfectly balanced by a light to moderate acidity. Full body, syrupy texture and no carbonation. Cider will never be the same again.
