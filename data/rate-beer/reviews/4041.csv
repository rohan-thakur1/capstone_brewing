Pours a slightly hazy, pale golden straw color with visible carbonation bubbling up and a two finger frothy white head.  Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap.  Large streaks and spots of soapy lacing left behind.

Delicate floral hop aroma that becomes more prominent as it warms.  Slight grassy/piny with subtle citrus and light fruit notes.  Hints of apple, pear, pineapple, grapefruit and lemon peel with a light biscuit malt backbone.   

Medium bodied with tight carbonation and a spicy, floral hop bite up front that provide some dry bitterness that lingers throughout.  This is countered mid-palate by pale malt, subtle citrus and some light fruit.  Bitter but not too much so with the perfect amount of dryness thats countered by bready yeast, biscuit and pale malt.  Im also picking up hints of straw, apple and pear.  Well balanced with great hop flavor making this beer very quaffable.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

4041,"2012-08-03",3.8,"Sampled at Blind Lady Ale House; July 2012
Arrives with an orange tinged, pale amber color that shows a brilliantly clear bright gold hue when held up to the light. The aroma is vibrantly hoppy with a huge tropical fruit focus that more than reminds me of candied peaches, lychee, ample guava, and tangelo zest. This is backed by a much softer, dank, herbaceous, perhaps even a touch woody hop character. The malt is quite subtle, and purely supporting with hints of hay and cracker.

The beer is quite light bodied, has a bit of prickly carbonation, but still has a touch of malt viscosity to it. Amply hoppy, this has quite a bit of hop bitterness to it, and the fruit character is quite a bit reduced compared to the nose due to the dryness of this beer. Still there is an herbaceious, essential citrus oil character here as well as some floral tropical fruit notes. Hints of pale malt dried straw and cracker are just noticeable, but clearly play a distant supporting role to the hops. The herbal hop character is perhaps dominant, a touch menthol, definitely pine like and perhaps a hint of dank hemp oil character; though this last is reduced from even the light touch that the nose had.

A more than nice Pale Ale, it could perhaps use a touch more body / residual sweetness, as this would accentuate more of the fruity hop flavors, but that would also ruin the incredible quaffability that this beer has.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

4041,"2012-07-15",4.1,"Pint at Urge. Pours a cloudy orange. The aroma is a blast of pure, wet hops. There are layers of grapefruit, lemon zest, pineapple and dankness. This is light bodied for as hoppy as it is. There isnt a real stickiness or heaviness, just a solid, huge wash of hops on the palate. More herbs and pineapple in the flavor. Very sessionable with its lighter mouthfeel and brilliant hop presence.  I could drink a lot of these.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

4041,"2012-07-14",3.7,"500ml bottle. thanks to baker. bottled date of 06262012.  pre-race beverage carbload... pours a slightly hazy, mostly transparent pale slightly darker than cider hue and topped with a medium soapy white head that gently recedes, leaving a frothy film around the edges... the aroma consists of a medium citrus focus adjoined by notes of grass.  pale biscuity malts provide a backbone but the hops play the dominant role.  a light perceived sense of bitterness offered by the grassy tones also take play... flavors are more of the same with crisp citrus overtones again meshing with an almost equal degree of grassiness.  clean crackery biscuity malt provides support.  the finish leaves a light bitter sensation on the palate that prolongs and extends after consumed.  light to medium bodied, more so the former, with crisp semi-lively carbonation.  would gladly have again.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"

Not a ton of pine, but plenty of grapefruit citrus.  The best part is the bitterness--there really isnt much.  Dry finish with bitterness peaking around a 3ish.

Medium to light bodied with a very oily, resinous, slick, beautiful palate. Flavor is ripe tangerine, clementine, mandarin orange and honeydew, with some amazing oniony, savory bite.

Nice lacing left behind as the beer drinks down.  The aroma is a blast of super fresh citrus, grapefruit and tangerine, and a great underlying resin character that really holds the aroma.  Bready toasted malt is present as well, also crazy fresh smelling.  The taste really balances the zip of the citrus hops with the dry body of the toasted malt.  The resin kicks in, and gives it an added ""dankness"" that really sets it apart from the IPA, that I tasted side by side.
