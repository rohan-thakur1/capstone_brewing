2333,"2017-06-18",4.0,"Gushing przy otwieraniu, piana średnio obfita, dość trwała, barwa rubinowa, lekko opalizująca. Aromat estrowy, głównie kandyzowane morele, suszone brzoskwinie, rodzynki, karmel, syrop klonowy, w tle przyprawy. W smaku podobnie, słodkie, wyklejające, dominują kandyzowane i suszone owoce oraz delikatnie pikantne fenole, w tle posmaki czerwonego wina, porto i ciasta drożdżowego. Goryczka nieduża ziołowo pestkowa, przyjemnie rozgrzewanie od alkoholu na finiszu. Wysycenie średnie, lepkie, gładkie, oleiste w odbiorze.

Dość klasyczne, ani ciemne ani jasne, BSA, kumulujące w sobie wszystko to, co charakterystyczne dla belgijskich drożdży i piw mocnych, aczkolwiek od AleSmith chciałoby się czegoś nieco ponad standard, zwłaszcza przy tej cenie za regularne piwo.","Kalisz, POLAND","alteregoo"

I scent toffee, spices and ripe fruit. With a drink I find red plum, strawberry jam, something yeasty and a mighty fine touch of bitterness throughout. The 10% abv is completely covered up.

Apparently hadnt had this before purchasing on a trip to AleSmith for Emilys birthday. Grabbed a 32-oz. growler for the festivities later, hoping I would get to review it. Liked it at first sip, giving it a 4.00 on Untappd. Reviewed it roughly six hours later.

Poured a copper amber clear color with two fingers of khaki white frothy head, which thinned out quickly. Decent amount of bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Decent watery lacing. Decent retention. (Sight - 3.75)

Smelled dark cherry candy, cloves, banana, purple grape, herbal, cherry cough medicine, raspberry and hints of wintry spices. (Smell - 4.00)

Lots of fruits on the tongue. Got cherry candy, followed by a splash of booze, feeling the warmth. Also cloves, plum and purple grape, ending with an abrupt finish. More prodding got me cherry jelly, a touch of banana, dark raisins, wintry spices (nutmeg, touch of cinnamon), Red Vine candy and peppery spices. (Taste - 4.25)

Medium body. Oily texture. Lively carbonation. Long, fruity finish (Feel - 4.25)

2333,"2016-12-25",4.3,"A 750, foiled only, bottling date smudged off (its at least new to this market). Nose fills the room with fruity esters, very Belgian, with searing phenols and a few burning fusels and dark caramel and plum. Really a gorgeous aroma. Pour a light chestnut that acquires fiery orange and scarlet tones under light, supports a foamy-rocky beige head with lace. Hot in the mouth but not too bad, much stronger are the black pepper and spice that scratch the tongue from front to back. Low bitterness a bit more medium after acclimation, bubblegum on the rise but still only to medium, little flits of pear and cherry, much more orange peel, lots of red berry, ester profile reminds of fresh Rochefort, bright and clear. Fine-grained light-medium carbonation.  Light-medium caramel, lightly sticky lips, fumes are appreciated and help conform to this catch-all style, overall medium body with a bit of fruitcake fullness now and then, and really pleasant burn that even picks up some mint.

Darker than expected with a clear amber body & medium sized creamy white head that holds.
Plenty of spicy, clovey, peppery phenolic character on the nose; pear esters, fragrant floral notes combining with toffee & toasty malts.
Full body, good creamy carbonation, doesnt give away too much of that big abv straight away.
Yeasty character takes hold again on the palate; white pepper, ripe pear and bananas, clove & cinnamon, bread dough, herbal hops with a backbone of pale toffee sweetness. Dry finish, moderate bitterness, a touch of booze warmth lingers.
Nice enough Belgian, not amongst the top of the style, but still darn nice.","Yarram, Vic, AUSTRALIA","Muggus69"

2333,"2014-07-17",3.8,"UPDATED: MAR 13, 2015 Luxury beer from this reputed American craft brewery, bottled in champagne bottles and apparently brewed with a Belgian trappist yeast strain. Dense, sticky, yellowish head over a warm bronze beer with a reddish glow, misty. Complexely perfumed with honey, apple sauce, apricot, tea leaves, candi sugar, hazelnuts, orange peel, plums, dried leaves, raisins, nutmeg. Sweet candi and fruity onset of which the candi syrup accent will guide you through the complete flavour trail; in the middle a big caramelly, nutty and honeyish maltiness, emphatic yeasty spiciness (there we have it) and a peppery hoppiness, which, in the end, gets the company of a warming alcohol effect reminiscent of amaretto and cognac, but not to a degree where it becomes disturbing. Great beer, just a little bit too cloying for me.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

La bouche est ravissante, douce, pleinement fruitée, bien maltée et chaude avec une subtile touche de bois vanillée.

Medium off dry slightly boozy body with a light carbonation. This is a very nice beer, it is really interesting in that it is a beer with high alcohol content and it is a Belgian Strong Ale, but while it is unmistakably both of those things it doesnt beat you senseless with either in any way. The alcohol, while noticeable, blends very well with other sensory aspects in the Aroma, Taste and Palate, and while the Belgian yeast leaves behind enough esters and phenolics to make its presence unmistakable, both chemical groups are mild enough to not overpower the surprisingly delicate balance of this masterfully brewed beer.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

Melanoid, prunes and plums come in with a bit of alcohol and licorice midway through. Long lingering sweet burnt sugar lingers long after every sip. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. Nice brew, I really enjoyed it.

3.0 A: Opaque medium brown color. Two fingers of fizzy beige head. Retention is below average and no lacing is left.

3.0 S: Brown sugar, caramel, and a rum soaked raisin type booziness. Fig and prune fruitiness. Some toastiness in there as well. Peppery spiciness. Light bready maltiness. The flavor profile looks better on paper than how it actually smells. The aromas dont balance each other out that well. Still, not bad.

2.5 T: This has mellowed to the point of being boring. Brown sugar and caramel are the strongest flavors. Almost tart fruitiness featuring dates, figs, and raisins. Light peppery spiciness. Booze is in check though.

2.5 M: Medium body. Carbonation level is right, but its a ""passive"" carbonation as opposed to the spritzy Belgain yeast carbonation that I like. Seems almost oily. Smooth though.

2.5 D: Didnt care for it fresh and I care for it even less with some age. Its not undrinkable, but its boring with a subpar mouthfeel.

Even further warming adds in the booze, and once this addition occurs, the Cold Duck and Concord grape scents morph into red wine territory.  Flavors of grape soda, strawberry, light raisin, sugary plums, with caramel and faint chocolate on the finish.  Cherries show up in abundance with further warming, and provide a slight tartness.

The yeast is extremely dominant at the nose and front of palate.  Its got a lot of carbonation as well, which I thought was kind of odd.

2333,"2010-06-29",3.7,"750mL from SouthBay, Pours a clear, deep red ruby with a towering yellow head that has absolutely insane retention and good to decent lacing. Holy beep. Nose at first is a sharp citric tartness, green apples, rich buttery caramel, mulled spice, mulled apple cider with whipped cream. Taste begins tart, dry, moves to caramel, spice, never moving to that characteristic sickly sweetness and old candy that plagues these dark fruit-forward Belgian strongs. But it does go a little papery, thin, cardboardy. Pretty yummy.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

The beer pours a hazy brown color with a white head. The aroma is sweet sugar with some vanilla and cherry notes.

2333,"2010-04-26",4.1,"A- Body is a very hazy translucent medium brown hue. Pours with a very large, foamy light tan colored head that is 3 fingers+. This subsides quickly to approximately 1 finger and has pretty good retention from there-although the 2nd pour produced much less and the head eventually faded completely leaving no lacing behind in the glass. Cloudiness is thick and somewhat dynamic with uniform translucency-but cloudiness whirls about the body. (Not going to dock for this since I have been milking this beer for 3 hours).

S- The nose is rich in dark fruit such as raisin and plum. Dark malt, a slight candi sugar sweetness, and a nice spicy yeast tone are also present along with a hint of phenols.

T-Upfront the flavors are a bit dry and fruity with some raisin coming through with a bit of a peppery spice accent. A hint of candi sugar also comes through as the brew first hits the tongue. A big bready, spicy yeast background is eminent behind this. The finish adds to the complexity with a bit of an alcohol heat and a more intensified spicy yeast presence. What liners is a bready, spicy yeast wrapped in a warm alcohol blanket.

P- Carbonation is tingly and high at first (especially when chilled) but mellows a bit to a nice medium carbonation when it warms a bit. Body is medium weight and very smooth and yeasty upfront but phenols can definitely be detected during the finish.

O- This is a very good beer and Alesmith is still yet to receive under a 4.0 from me. The ABV is present but gives more of a warmign effect than an astringency-and that is very good. Its a solid, wonderful beer all around and very complex. Not my favorite from this brewing co. (but hey it has very rough competition)-but this proves to be a wonderful representation of a BSDA and is solid all around. Alesmith is probably my favorite CA brewery. I need to make another trip to OH in order to pick up a 2nd Speedway to review (awesome but consumed during my reviewing break)...and I need to try other Alesmith Brews.

2333,"2009-08-16",3.6,"750 ml. bottle picked up at Johns Marketplace in Portland, Oregon. Not really much head on this one. I tried to agitate it and still it didnt produce that much head. Dark brown, fairly translucent. Not really what I was expecting in terms of appearance. Buttery toffee aroma? WTF? Slight nut aroma as well. Sweet aroma that is very subtle at first, but when it warms up it becomes fairly sweet smelling. An odd aroma that I wasnt expecting. Not overly pungent. Sweet beer with a fruit/roast/toffee flavor. The subtle roast comes in later, and allows the beer to finish well. Sweet flavor is nice, but this isnt what I was expecting out of a Belgian strong. Not as carbonated, which for me is nice. Overall, not a bad Belgian.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"

Not bad, but you can just tell its past its prime and not designed for aging.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"
2333,"2009-07-18",4.6,"To me AleSmith can be hit and miss.  I want to love everyone of their beers and I cannot say that I do.  The Grand Cru lifts the bar and holds it high.

I was a tad disappointed when I took the foil off and found a cap and not a cork, but from there on it was a pure delight.

This is a big beer from start to finish.  A dark amber slightly cloudy look with a thick and pale head leaves light lacing after every sip.

Vanilla and caramel aromas abound and the alcohol content is evident before it touches the lips.

Spicy yeast is the first flavor impression and it gives way to a slightly fruity and sweet caramel finish.

This is a medium body malty and low hop beer that at 10+% is a pure delight by any measure.

2333,"2009-07-12",3.4,"750mL bottle, 2006 vintage, courtesy of throwitallaway, poured into a snifter.

Pours with low carbonation out of the bottle - an aggressive pour producing a few big bubbles that recede immediately leaving the tiniest of rings around the glass.  Its a slightly hazy caramel brown with no lacing though the beer leaves some legs on the way down.

The aroma is sweet, with lots of brown sugar and caramel malts.  There is plenty of rum-soaked dark fruit, and possibly a bit of oxidation in the nose.

The taste has a sweet fruity kick up front with booze-soaked apricots and pears dominating.  The backbone is big on caramel malts and the finish is slightly oxidized and very dry with some cardboard in the aftertaste.

The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and super slick with very little carbonation.

This is a decent beer, though I think the oxidation and complete lack of carbonation has hurt it a bit.  The aroma and taste are still fairly good, but this particular bottle has seen better days.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"
2333,"2009-07-07",3.9,"Bottle from Peter at AleSmith, apparently from the original bottling, but the label was silk screened, so I have no idea.  In any case, this one pours a warm shade of amber with a pillowy tan head.  Smells of dark fruit, yeast, and booze -- all of which are mirrored in the flavor along with added notes of caramel and vanilla.  Nears a barleywine in flavor, particularly in the way the alcohol is featured.  I thought this had a couple years of age on it, but it certainly didnt taste that way.

2333,"2009-07-05",3.4,"This was the last beer of an evening of several pretty big beers (American Independence Day), and I have to say that I probably wouldve enjoyed it more had it been the first beer of the evening rather than the last.  It was certainly not bad, but not what I was expecting (a problem I would not have had if I read the bottle), but not a great night-cap for a hot evening spent outdoors.  Still, pretty good, and something Id be willing try again.

The body was a sort of muddy red-brown with very little head.  The description says it is ""crystal clear (when served properly)"" - Im dying to know what those conditions are!  I thought for some reason that flavor would be fruitier and lighter than it was; in actually it was a pretty heavy sweet cerealness with lots of biscuity character above it with some very sweet alcohol tang to it.  Mouthfeel was dry and warming, owing largely to the high ABV.

I wasnt a huge fan of this one, but given the circumstances, Id be willing to give it another try.

Light, sweet, and yet promisingly boozy.  Initial flavor is significantly more full and darker than the aroma let on.  Raisins, chocolate, vanilla extract (alcohol interference).  The initial tang really gets things off on the right foot though.  There isnt a ton of movement in the palate after that initial tangy flare which then fades to the to the aforementioned flavors.  Im not gettin the toasty flavor in the finish that the description offers up.  There are great beers, good beers, decent beers, acceptable beers, and unacceptable beers.  This one falls between great and good.  Mostly, I think, because the body and mouthfeel, for my taste, leave a bit to be desired.  Still, it is quite yummy.","San Diego, California, USA","gorditoabd"

Pours dark amber with a ruby hue.
No head developed, even with a stretch pour.
A thin ring of white lace ran around the edges of the glass with a few dots of lacework remaining.

Sweet malt, candied fruit, and caramel start the nose. Cherries, tangerines, grape jam, cloves, and rum follow through.

Medium bodied, slick, and slightly syrupy.
Low carbonation lends a light chew to the mouthfeel.

Ripe fruit, sweet malt, and rummy alcohol lead off the palate. Hints of Grand Marnier, red grapes, cherries, raisins, and ripe berries add plenty of depth.

Finishes with warming alcohol, a light peppery note on the throat, and plenty of lingering ripe fruit.

Three years on its side has really rounded this beer out. The spiciness when young has stepped back and allowed plenty of complex fruit to come forward.

2333,"2008-12-09",3.0,"I found this beer to be disappointing.  Totally by coincidence, I had this after Ale Asylum Grand Cru, and given my respect for AleSmith, I was shocked that it ""lost"" that comparison.  Both are malty versions of a belgian ale/dubbel, but the difference is that this is out of balance -- a cerealy malt dominates the subtler notes associated with a dubbel and candi sugar.  Some nice toasty, minty, vanilla notes almost get lost.","Hartland, Wisconsin, USA","Flyer"
2333,"2008-12-07",3.7,"75cl bottle.   Beautiful clear deep chestnut brown colored body.   The head is pretty weak, but Ill cut it some slack because the color is really perfect.   Wonderfully complex aroma of dark candi sugar, toffee, fruity notes of berries, and some cinnamon.   The flavor is sweet and is dominated by toffee, with some vanilla dried fruit as well.   I was looking for a little more balance and complexity, but it is still pretty nice.   Full, almost chewy body is a bit heavy, but the ample amount of silky carbonation lets it move over the tongue well enough to avoid any excessive, cloying stickiness.   Pretty nice beer, though missing some yeasty complexities that I look for in the style that would make it stand out.   At the premium price it commands, I probably wont be buying this in the future.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Pours a clear honey amber with a one finger frothy tan head that drifts down to a thin but complete cap, minimal spots of lacing.  Aroma is initially some of telltale that belgian yeast, with sweet spices, dark fruits, maybe some breadiness.  Flavor is a touch sweet, with more bready malts, ripe fruits, and light spice.

This is a beautiful beer. Nose is figs, white grapes, bit of yeast and sweet caramel malt then blend into a beautiful breadiness - clean and wonderfully crisp. Picks up some nutty cocoa notes as it warms. Flavor is equally fantastic - starts with a big hit of yeast, but then a big toasty sweet malt quality is folded into the massive vinous fruity notes - raisins and dates, slightly over-ripe apples, pears - it’s all there, along with a bit of spicy brown sugar sweetness. Finish is yeasty, rich with lingering fruit and doughy malt notes, and a vinous exhale. Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, smooth and a bit syrupy, full.

Quite vinious as well. Low carbonation, wonderful creamy mouthfeel. Flavour is lovely balanced even if it is quite vinious. Lots of overripe, dried fruits (raisins, plums) with some Belgian sugar.

Very sweet start that quickly turns tart. A fair amount of an apple cider flavor to it. A trace of pine or spice, a tinge of oak too. Very light and clean mouthfeel. A greatly delayed  alcohol warmth. Good in small doses.

Had a glass from a bottle of the 07 vintage at the OTM 1st anniversary AleSmith tasting. This particular batch is full of warm chocolate and a melted vanilla cream.

2333,"2008-10-08",3.9,"2006 vintage - Thank you Peter and Jessica.  Cloudy dark amber in color with a very slight off-white head--limited carbonation from the aging, but still enough to distribute the complex flavor profile delicately across the palate.  The aroma is filled with caramel malt, fruity fermentation esters, and alcohol all melded together by a velvety aged characteristic that enrobes everything.  The aroma characteristics flow directly onto the palate with the addition of well-constructed bitterness and some sweetness from malt and alcohol.  Restrained fermentation flavors provide harmonious counterpoints for the substantial maltiness in the big body.  Very well-constructed to have aged this long and still be so vibrant.  This is a really fun ""new-world"" Belgian-style ale.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

2333,"2008-08-26",3.7,"750ml from HiTime Wine. I don’t know what it is, but I’ve not had especially good luck with either the Horny Devil or the Grand Cru from Alesmith. Clearly the aim here is to produce a rich, wine-dark quad, and it’s clearly got the rich and complex aroma of that style. It’s complemented by some of the features of the original Decadence, too - toffee, chocolate, a hint of tobacco. But the problem I just can’t avoid is that it’s almost completely uncarbonated, resulting in a thin body that does the brew no service whatsoever. Still a very well crafted, complex, and flavorful beer, but not top shelf.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

The aroma is strikingly fruity, warm and caramely, with a distinct alcohol note noticeable underneath everything.  Much like an aged barleywine in the sweet caramel and fruit notes while laking much hoppiness.  The flavor is pleasant, not too syrupy, and lays down a nice layer of biscuity caramel and brown sugar, while a light bitterness develops.  A touch of maple can be seen toward the finish as well.  I expected more of a dominating sweetness to match the nose, but it seems very well balanced.  The body is medium to light, again, not what I expected, and much more palatable especially with the dry finish.  Very enjoyable.","Lexington Park, Maryland, USA","wickedpete"

2333,"2008-07-26",3.8,"750 ml bottle shared by theisti. Pours a hazy bronze with a creamy beige head that quickly reduces to a thin ring of bubbles clinging to the edge of the glass. The nose is of banana, toffee, apples, brown sugar & alcohol. (Aside from 3F’s Alpha Kong, I’ve never smelled a non-wheat beer that smells more like bananas than this one.) Medium-bodied and grainy with a mildly ""warm"" finish. The flavor is a boozy version of the nose. This is certainly a solid beer, but I guess after giving a 4+ rating to the seven Alesmith beers I’ve sampled prior to this one, I felt just a little ""let down"" by this beer.

The flavor had dark, vinous fruits, caramel, vanilla, and chocolate sweetness permeated by the spicy yeast that weaved in and out, leaving a trail of decadent darker spices.. finished stronger with vinous notes and aged caramel.

Super-clear!  Aroma was not very intense.  Although this might have had more to do with Pizza Port itself.  Initial flavor: alcohol and spice lingers on the pallet and in the sinus.  Starts off sweet but quickly becomes intense.  No real hoppy characteristic, but smooth and strong.  Undertones of green apples and cranberries.  The Caramel notes come out as it warms in your hand.  Overall, pretty good but not really my favorite to have with a salad or pizza.  Much better for dessert or smoking!  Worth the price though.","Orange, California, USA","chrisafari"

Orange peel, plums and dates, a nice mix of sweet and sour fruitiness. Spicy, herbal medicinal alcohol that has a low temperature warmth in the palate. Towards the end toasted almonds emerge in the taste, leaving a flavorful nuttiness in the aftertaste. I love the dry spicy, toasted finish this emits, conspicuous and lingering.

Excellent balance of tastes, the alcohol is very subtle, one of the smoothest sippers Ive had in awhile. I wish I had more bottles of this in my basement ""cellar"".","East Central, Georgia, USA","jpm30"

2333,"2007-09-04",4.0,"75 cL bottle from Servall (10% on the bottle). Post-99, as the gold medal is memorialized on the bottle. The aroma is dark, ripe stone fruit, but like overripe peach rather than plummy. The color is ripe reddish fruit flesh, and the head just went poof. Full bodied. Near creamy carbonation. Starts ripe stone fruit, almost toffee, definitely chocolate, maybe cherry skins. Vanilla is very low key, until the finish. The finish is relatively dry, fruity notes, but not a great deal of bitter. Maybe a bit of orange oil. Whatever it is, it is pretty complex. This was a dusty bottle, and the only Grand Cru left in the store. Besides that, it was at a ""sale price"". The bottle was red and gold, rather than gold. If anyone has an idea how old it was, please share. Im guessing 4-6 yrs. The palate is reminiscent of a mature Gales. And such a large bottle.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
2333,"2007-09-02",3.9,"750 ml bottle from brewery. Pours a slightly cloudy dark brown with a small off white head that fades quickly. Aroma was a bit weak with oranges and almonds. Flavor was complex with caramel, oranges, apricots, vanilla, butterscotch, walnuts and barley. Hops were well integrated and play an effective supporting role. Mouthfeel is creamy and silky with a slight film. Carbonation was a bit less than expected (I dont think the cap was tight enough, it came off easily with no bottle pressure noted). Finish is sweet, clean and medium in duration. Overall this   is a great beer.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"

Definitey a sweet, fruity, yeast aroma.  I can taste many different flavors, such as caramel malt, raisins, and dried fuit.  I am not finding the chocolate as the description states, but a can taste the vanilla, with other mild spices.  However, something is slighlty missing...maybe a bit rough around the edges?

2333,"2007-06-28",3.8,"Bottle, of recent days.  So this bottle is brown while others are green?  Anyway, pours a tan/ruby color with a rather small head.  Long lasting ring of foam on the second glass.  Aroma is sweet and fruity, but its a thoroughly malt covered fruit presence.  A nice mixture of cherries and pears with some cola and caramel thrown in.  The second glass with all the yeast poured in has a more balanced aroma with some light doughy malt hovering above the fruit and a slight raisin presence.  Taste is in a similar state of trying to balance the fruits with the earthy sweet malts.  Brown sugar hits the tongue first, but then the pears and cherries seems like theyre floating above that.  In the end, the flavor is tied in fairly well, and finishes with a stronger yeast based flavor (much better on the dreg pour).  Some grapes, and a bready spicy ""dubbel-like"" yeast flavor.  Then you get a nice dose of earthy buttery hops to finish things.  A bit of alcohol hitting the throat too.  I didnt get much hop flavor in the first glass, but its there in the second glass.  The beer felt kinda slick and slippery, though it was moderately carbonated.  Could have been creamier.  Good stuff overall, but I feel like theres something else that this beer should be doing.  You know, this reminded me a lot of Old Stock Ale actually, but with a Belgian yeast presence.  Interesting.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

Some Belgian yeast hint, which is smothered by alcohol. Sweet dark fruits of dates, raisins, but mainly a caramel sweetness is apparent, along with that alcohol. Mouthfeel is overly carbonated, bubbly with generous alcohol burn on the palate. Has a malty flavor. Sweet, boozey, esters. Syrupy fruityness. Some caramel apples, subtle spicyness of cinnamon, glazed figs. Has a light roastyness with plenty of alcohol. This stuff is somewhat simple, with an overall malty, boozey sweet profile, although it is still not bad. I just expect greater complexity in ""Grand Cru"" Belgian style ales. This stuff didnt develop anything with warmth, or later sips. If this stuff holds well with age, it may improve a bit. However, Im starting to notice that high alcohol content doesnt necessarily mean Ales will age well; Im guessing its other factors, like the yeast used.

2333,"2007-02-03",3.9,"The beer arrived in a handsome bomber, courtesy of BA dogfoodog.  After removing the gold foil, I was expecting to use the corkscrew, but the plain old crown cap made liberating the beer a much easier proposition.  I was also surprised by the green glass, which seems to be more of an exception for and American craft brewery use.  The Duvel tulip I had appointed for imbibing awaited, so without further looking, I poured the beer.  The body was Burgundy in color and quite clear.  There was very little head to start with, and it faded right away.  Despite the D etched at the bottom of the glass, there were no streamers, and the beer sat very still.

The smell was richly layered with dark malt goodness.  I could smell raisins, figs, red beets, and grapes.  The taste was pretty much the same, except some hop bitterness and oak wood like dryness became apparent at the end of each sip.  This and a hint of sourness kept the taste from being too sweet.  I was expecting a little more complexity from this beer, but overall this ended up being a little bit bland.  It was slippery and smooth on the tongue, and not as thick as I initially suspected.

Very sweet beer, but never is it too much, despite there being no bitterness to balance it out.  Definitely a lot of cherry and strawberry.  Just a hint of sourness in the finish, but nothing like I was expecting from the aroma.  Notable alcohol in the back.  Big chocolate flavor.  I cant pick out any hops flavor, but I have to assume that they were used skillfully to coax some more of that fantastic fruit flavor out of the beer.  Outstandingly smooth.  Retains some Belgian yeast character, but not enough to be overpowering like a Unibroue.  This allows it to be fantastically drinkable.  I can hardly put the glass down long enough to type.  Beautiful beer.  I would give anything to be able to craft something this spectacular.  I better post this before Im drunk.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"

I have been sitting on this for a special occasion.  That happens to be the Louisville Cardinals as 2007 Orange Bowl champions.  Nothing like a beer with a hint of oranges in it to celebrate the biggest victory in school history.  Thanks to whomever sent me this in a trade - it proves that Alesmith is among the best brewers in the country.
Aroma / Appearance - The deep caramel body left a thin to nonexistant head.  A clear stick lacing slid down the sides of the glasses leaving behind layers like beer strata.  A combination of cherries, caramel, orange liquer, chocolate and honey form a very inviting nose with slightly sweet impression.
Flavor / Palate - Chocolate dipped cherries fill the mouth after the first sip.  Next comes a blend of orange rinds, vanilla, honey and caramel.  The mouthfeel is very dense but flat.  A vinous aftertaste precedes a dry semisweet finish.  Only towards the very end does the almost 11% ABV alcohol make itself known.  Otherwise you could sip on this all night without noticing the effects.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

If there ever was a 10% ABV session beer this is the one! This is something I very seldom have experienced in the authentic Belgian ales!

Hoppiness is minimal.  Some vanilla and smoke is in there as well.  This subsides into a warm, alcoholic finish.

That would be fine if they didnt charge significantly more than the Belgium beers they aspire to be.  This pours deep bronze with a fizzy tan head.  The aroma has caramel malts, candi sugar, breadiness, raisins, figs and earthy.  Very full and rich and gives the impression the taste will be authentic Belgium tasting.  Medium body with an over abundance of carbonation.  Taste has earthy caramel, dark fruits and some biscuitiness.  They flavor come off just short of being from Belgium.

Pour was a dark brown, tiny head, and first sip made me think the bottle may be no good... not because it tasted bad or off, but because it was so different than I was expecting. I was thinking along traditional grand cru lines, pale with a big head, spicy and spritzy... this is anything but! Aroma is very hot, dark cherry characteristics, lemon, spices. In the mouth it is much more interesting, an intricate mesh of flavors, lots of spices, caramel, plum, licorice... even some steak/meat. Still very hot in the mouth, though overall the beer is very smooth, Im not sure more aging would do it well. With the oxidation and sherry notes Ive noticed, even, I think maybe this beer would just be drunk best fresh. I wish I knew when this bottle was actually produced!","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"
2333,"2006-11-11",3.8,"Complex and incredibly sweet beer. Cloudy reddish body with big-bubbled head. Something was off with the carbonation because there was little making an already sweet beer seem even sweeter. Strong nose of sweet sugar, cramel, alcohol, overripe fruit, especially plum, and a slight funky Band-Aid note. The flavor was sweet  fruits, plum, brown sugar, caramel with a warm, peppery alcohol finish. The palate was flat and slightly sticky. Despite its inadequate carbonation, this was still an excellent sipping beer.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","jcr"
2333,"2006-11-10",3.7,"Pours a deep cherry, almost brandy, color with a really bubbly head.  Seems this could have used a few more months to fully bottle condition.  The aroma really waifs out of the glass, almost like a fuel.  There is a definite alcohol heat in the nose, but it is paired with a plethora of fruity esthers and complex malts.  Deep fruits - plummy bananas and sweet cherries are a constant theme here.  The body is really sweet - caramelized fruits drenched in honey sweet.  This is a great dessert beer or fireside sipper but a little too sweet for mass consumption.","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

2333,"2006-10-26",3.8,"Another illustration of FlacoAltos philanthropy, and substantiation of AleSmiths talent, the Grand Cru was to me the real test of the admired brewery. My tendency towards Belgian styles conjures what Ive found to be an excellent examination of American zymology. Succeeding at the Imperial IPA, the task set by a Belgian ale is entirely different and its achievement shows to me versatility and nuance of quality. Poured, the head appeared as a layer of crème Anglaise, densely heaped above an opaque autumnal red body. Estery and spicy to the nose, the blend reveals banana and bubble gum, clove, cardamom, cinnamon and pepper. Reminiscent of a Tripel as a grainy corn aroma emerges, this Grand Cru elaborately joins a touch of Irish Cream to flowery peaches. The flavor takes on a slightly hoppy metallic tinge and spicy burn, suggesting an Americanized, or at least AleSmithized approach to the style. Dry coffee and chocolate malts are subdued but add nonetheless a weighty background to the sticky banana, cinnamon and clove combination. While the carbonation seems initially overwhelming, it slowly recedes to uncover a smooth and enjoyable texture. Overall, I was pleased by the effort, but it left me longing for more of that undefinable Belgian flair which seems so difficult to find elsewhere.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

2333,"2006-09-29",3.8,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2007 Bottle number two of the elusive AleSmith to come from Kepanos bountiful box of benison bliss is the Grand Cru.  Undeterred by the YuleSmith, which for disliking I am forever one of the fallen, I enthusiastically grabbed my glass and made for a dramatic pour.  There are few things in life that cant be tastefully improved with a bit of bravado.  This was actually a much more important drink than a simple AleSmith tasting.  There is no confusion about AleSmiths quality here  a session with AleSmith is a special session indeed.  But this was something of a practice round for the GABF.  It was training to make sure I could recognize quality where it was widely accepted to exist.  And I think, to that end, it was a success.  That, and it was a fine beer too.  The head was thick.  It may have been large or lumpy or bubbly, but at that moment I could only recognize it as thick, in the same way someone might name their new powerful piece of machinery Thick.  It was a foam that could flex muscle.  It was DENSE.  Colored like custard, it sat and grimaced like a retired bouncer, keeping guard above the pomegranate red beer below.  It was such a weighty top that it actually crushed itself, crackling like a bowl of Rice Krispies fresh with milk.  Though I was wholly entertained by the visual spectacle of the Grand Cru I was gently reminded there were other elements to be reviewed.  The smell, to which I may be unfairly harsh after being torn away from that glorious foamy toy, inspired a vicious hunger.  My gut wrenched and moaned as I took in the aromas of beef briscuit, salt, corn flour, Coca-cola, brown sugar, molasses and teriyaki.  It told the story of a dark, heavy meal of meat and sugar which, after my collegiate lunches of white rice and dinners of pasta seemed worlds away.  I took a taste, delving further into the liquidous feast, and found it to be low, slow and droopy like an old cowboys moustache.  Salty and dark, it tasted like a Strong Belgian Ale without any of the sugar or esters, relying on a soothing roasted coffee and stewed vegetable blend, leaving a lingering aftertaste of delicious malts.  Its a plainer beer while cold but warms up to the drinker with time.  If it is missing that sweet flavor profile, and if that seems like a travesty, I can find two reasons why its not.  First, it makes for a very mature beer that would go great with hearty meals in a way that beers with sweeter tones may not.  Second, it helps to single out the meatier parts of other Strong Belgian Ales by taking out an obfuscating element.  In other words, it trains a drinker to evaluate Belgians with more clarity to exercise better judgment in the future when really deep, complex and mind bending beers come to the tongue.  And since I was, in a way, prepping for the GABF the Grand Cru succeeded independently as a beer and as a means to improve my own tasting abilities.

2333,"2006-07-22",3.6,"Poured a semi-translucent brown with hints of amber and copper.  Surprisingly, the head was nearly non-existent.  The only evidence of carbonation came from a frothy white ring around the glass.  The aroma was nearly pure malt and brewers yeast followed by sweet hints of fruit.  I was somewhat unimpressed until I took my first sip.  The light carbonation lends to a light syrup-like consistency.  The flavor is well balanced with smoke, malt, yeast, nutty caramel and fruity tastes.  Light hop tastes produces just enough bitter taste to counteract the sweetness.  The high alcohol percentage is masked nicely.  An overall enjoyable beer despite its deceptive appearance.","Rhode Island, USA","estarrio"

My second attempt at the beer was from a 2003 bottle, and it was completely different.  The most notable difference was the presence of what seemed to be a nutty sherry-like quality.  Now this very well could have been an infection, but it blended with the beer very well.  The depth of flavor and character was quite exceptional.  Caramelized honey topped over light summer fruits, with vanilla and malt and a complex spiciness, and of course that wonderful nuttiness of pecans.

2333,"2006-06-07",3.3,"UPDATED: DEC 13, 2009 Re-rate, Dec. 2009: Stinking bottle about 2yrs old, and boy, this thing has fallen apart. So much for an ageable, beer, and like the Weizenbock and the Wee Heavy, a piece of junk from the original. Train wreck, oxidized, nasty maple-like and stale caramel malts. All bad. Re-rate: November 2006: The aroma started out some bananas during the pour, then strong cherries and then strong rum. Alcohol was really hot and strong, other caramel flavors, citrus, some oak underneath. I stand by my original ratings, bumping up only the appearance for the decent but not overly impressive head. Original rating: Hmmmm.... At the risk of being deemed a beer heretic, I gotta say, this is no where near top within the style, completely missing on multiple accounts, although not a bad beer overall. The appearance was typical in color, although the head was non-existent and the lacing lame. The aroma was somewhat vinous, a little bit of oak, and some coffee. The flavor was similar with cofee taking too large a role, especially within style. The dark fruits were lacking. The hops were too plentiful for a belgian strong ale. Additionally, the hops were of an American variety (Amarillo?) and out of line for the style. The mouthfeel was somewhat thin. I boo this beer, relative to its ratings. Boooo.

Such energetic little bubble burn their lives out quickly though leaving behind murky carmel colored sea of anticipation.  The aroma is a gift of breath from a dough boy who ate pears.  The first sip takes you by suprise: at first you think the beer is flat but a quick burst of carbonation sneaks down the middle of your tongue like a small child rushing between your feet unexpectedly.  A solid taste foundation of fermented fruit occupies the middle of the wagon train of taste.  Finally, bringing up the rear is a mouth-coating taste of acidic bile.

Sampled at the 4th Boulder Strong Ale Fest. Beer poured a clear, medium amber-brown color with a small, creamy/frothy, off-white, diminishing head. The aroma was moderately malty with notes of sweet toasted grain, cookie and caramel; hoppy with moderate notes of herbs; yeasty notes of moderate dough; miscellaneous scents included notes of light oak and vanilla and moderate amounts of sour green apple, spicy alcohol, honey. A hint of banana in the retros. The flavor was heavily sweet, moderately bitter with a light, sweet, mderately bitter, moderately tangy finish. Full and tasty. The body was medium, the texture was creamy, the carbonation was lively and the finish was lightly alcoholic. <P>

After 20 months of aging, omg.  Its like wine.  Rich, dark fruits; highly alcoholic; amazing aroma, like a sweet wine with beer characteristics.  Fantastic.  A little age shapes this stuff into something amazing.  All of the almost uncoordinated, sweet esters have united and matured into a fruity deliciousness that I had not anticipated: the fruits have darkened, and matured wonderfully.

Tap @ brewery.  This may be my first Grand Cru...  Reddish-amber with a tan head and good lacing.  Aroma is almost tropical with pineapple, clove, orange, alcohol, roastiness, banana--the esters are out of control.  Body is medium/full, light and creamy carbonation, dry, mouthwatering.  Alcoholic warmth is noticeable, malty sucker!  Caramel, fruits--banana, plumb, raisin, prune.  Roasty.

2333,"2006-02-19",4.2,"(Being starved for good beer, arjoseph fends off a particularly sharp withdrawl pang by retreating to his ""cellar"" to procure some long-saved bottle, and drinking it.)  2003 vintage.  75cl into Duvel tulip glass.  Thanks to cquiroga, as always, for a generous gift.  The pour produces a smallish-medium sized head of yellow brown-gray (""gray"" or ""grey""?  I never know) bubbles, some of which are dense and small and others (mostly in the center) are largish and soapy looking.  The head diminishes not instantly but quickly, leaving a ring of the soapy bubles on the edge.  Said bubles pop intermittently like an unenergetic witchs cauldron.  The head will revive if the beer is swirled, but it will diminish just as quickly.  Lacing is almost nonexistent, but where the foam does cling to the side, it does so in an archipelago of irregular islands of very dense, almost imperceptibly small bubbles.  The sub-surface ""racing"" is deep at first, and mildly energetic (by which I mean it doesnt race to the top, but doesnt rise sluggisly either).  Color is ruby brown with orange-yellow highlights, both glowing in the almost-transparent transluscency.  The aroma is strong; I can smell this thing almost immediately after the pour, even though my nose is at least a foot away from the glass (and two from the bottle).  The nose is burnt leaves, buttered saltine crackers, brown sugar, burnt caramel; I can smell lots of sweetness and musty malts.  This reminds me of autumn, like harvested corn in silos and sugars of various colors being baked in cookies and pies.  The taste is just as sweet and musty as the smell.  On the medium to full body, this might be considered syrupy by some, but I dont think it reaches that level on sweetness or thickness.  Flavors of candied apple and peach prop up buttery and sugary malts.  Right after the swallow, acid emerges in the form of overripe prunes and apricot, mellowing into a light meringue sweetness with a strong vanilla character.  About 5 seconds after the swallow, the finish kicks in: musty, burnt, almost smoky; the harvest impression of corn comes back (maybe even Indian maize); the alcohol wafts up the nose and adds an acrid bite.  Some kind of hops add to the acrid/musty bitterness, which lingers for minutes.  In all, this is a great beer.  I think the age might contribute to the character and potency of the finish; if it were a bit younger, the acrid and overripe qualities might not be so prevalent, which I think would make it better (but only marginally so).  In the end, I have no hyperbolic remarks (not even ""dope""), only deservedly high marks.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Hazy mahogany with not much effervescence and only a thin white ring for head.  Nice grainy barleywine aroma containing some almost sour banana and only a faint glimmer of hops.  Really only a little fruit and perhaps a touch of coffee.  Flavour=pure malt.  This beer is even sort of worty--could it possibly be under attenuated?  Or not yet fully conditioned?

Taste is darkly sweet and ripe with ample dark fruity flavors masked within a molasses tang. Has a partial smokey finish with regards to some vanilla, brown sugar, and licorice. Nice doughy center and creamy mouthfeel with a sweetly dark brigade behind it all keeping a fairly bold and dense action of flavors and bread doughy heft. Dark cherry hints and very light tobacco spices sweep off and on throughout the finishing areas as it floats away with one finely appealing dryness.

Mellow but stark and darkly set with sweet fruits and sugared breads. Age has suited this well. The feel is quite big still. Creamy medium/full tilted body with just a slight edge of warmth and alcoholic texture underneath. Bold, clean, and rightly set with dark fruity tang and sweetness. Nicely balanced.

Everything thats in big trappists is there.  Banana, clove, citrus, raisin, dates, figs, dried cherries.  In addition, there is a good amount of chocolate malt and some serious roast to it.

a nice copper color w/ a tall thick off white head w/ some nice lacing.  Smells of belgian yeast a light carmel malt and hint of vanilla.  Palate is lightly creamy a nice carbonation and a warming swallow.  Flavor can taste the alcohol as well as some sweet carmel malts a touch roasted w/ raisens.

Arômes pleinement caramel brûlé, toffee et mélasse sous une forte présence de levure rappelant la croûte de pain brun.  Superbement maltée en bouche, un peu de cacao et de noix grillées mais devenant rapidement unidimensionnelle.

2333,"2005-06-22",3.6,"2000 vintage corked bottle, generously provided by Odeed.  Shared with Olivier_MTL on 6/18/2005 post-ABF.This unfiltered creation pours a thick-looking mahogany and dark-chocolate brown, with some dark beige/brass tones on the edges, quite murky, even though I was careful not to disturb the yeast.  Head is a medium-tan, large initially, receding fairly rapidly to settle out at a retained covering.  Head is lightly fluffy, but has some large bubbles in it.  Lacing is left on the glass.  Aroma has a full sherry oxidation note, which I always seem to pick up first, followed by molasses, dry toffee, crusty brown bread, vanilla extract and a subtle but strong Belgian yeast which is both perfumey (though that is held in check by the strong sweetness) and spicy, of hazelnuts, clove, light orange-rind notes and possibly some small amounts of alcohol.  Flavor is very sweet, and richly malted.  The extraction is wonderful as I have come to expect from AleSmith.  Full toffee and marshmallows, with rich caramel and light chocolate.  There is definite warmth from a vanilla liqueur-like heat which provides both drying alcohol and spice notes.  Finish shows sherry, strong, oily vinous notes and bits of chocolate.  My sample certainly was medium-full to full-bodied on account of the huge maltiness.  Mouthfeel was slick, with low carbonation.  The biggest problem I had was the lack of complexity.  Aside from the caramel/toffee malt sweetness and spicy yeast and alcohol esters, there wasnt much else going on.  Its hard to believe this bottle would be passed its prime at only 5 years of age, so Im not really sure what the problem was.  To be fair, I think I should get a bottle of Abbaye Des Rocs Grand Cru and age that for some time and compare it to an aged bottle of this.  Still, as disappointed as I was, it was not a bad beer in the least.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Finish is dry with a lot of alcohol left over. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, lightly carbonated, very resilient as it hangs around with a nice balance of flavor after each sip.

The taste is sweet with a thick-mouth coating feel to it that is quite satiating.  The flavor is quite fruity, again I get notes of raisins as well as notes of prunes.

It looks similar to the Abbaye des Rocs Grand Cru.  The nose actually is not real strong.  I picked up dark fruits, caramel and brown sugar.  The taste had some chocolate, vanilla and cherry.

I was a bit aprehensive about the age of the beer, but Alesmith dude told me when I visited the brewery that it was still aging nicely.  He was correct.  Deep brown, with the slightest hint of ruby, light but persistent carbonation.  Aroma was faint, slight caramel and cherries, with some warming alcohol.  Caramel and a smoky, almost woodsy note are the predominate flavors.  In the background, vanilla, chocolate, and faint cherries make themselve known.  All in all, a tasty brew.  I could only have wished for a bit more body.  RERATE:  A decade later, this has finally hit distribution here in Virginia.  I rated this without looking back, and was shocked at the similarities between my fresh draft sample and my original rating of 10 years ago.  I dont even need to update the notes.  Although my numbers may have shifted, they still came out to the same in the end, so I just let it be.  Good stuff.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

Nice aroma dominated by malt and yeast, with some passion fruit. It was an amber, almost dark brown clear color with little head but good lacing. Flavor was very smooth considering the alcohol content; very warming but not too sharp. A little vinuous, something I like in a Belgian strong, along with vanilla and oak falvors.

Sour, musty fruit aroma with chocolate, spices (perhaps cinnamon?), toffee and lots of bready yeast.  The flavor was dominated by dark fruit and not-so-hidden alcohol, bready yeast flavors, toast and maybe a touch of apple.  Musty and rather sour, slightly sulfuric.

2333,"2004-11-07",4.9,"Bottle. 2000 Vintage. Drank 11/2004 
Okay, Ive had this beer before a few times and never got around to rating it. All of the times Ive had it before though the vintage was recent to the year I was drinking it, but then... I found the holy grail.  Its the end of 2004 when I am writing this and I am drinking a 2000 that I found at this ghetto liqour store, discounted to boot. There is little more to say other than this is perfect in every way. Soft on the palate with a gentle carbonation creating an ever-present off-white head. Subtle malty aroma with tons of fruit. Banana, Mandarin and dates, dough and cinnamon to boot. Flavor of all of the above. Absolutely sublime.","Lancaster, California, USA","Sven"

Incredible and an instant ""5"" at first taste. Round, very dynamic and very full-bodied. Front is mainly fruit, cherries, plums and dark grapes. In the backround a big caramel and nutty body of deep malt is present. On the finish is port wine and a spicy yeastiness.

The looks of it: rich ruby hue, opaque, slim, beigish sliver of foam.
The smell of it: port wine meets cognac, dark fruits meets a mature, well-mannered alcohol burn, sophisticated and almost sublime, a jammy medley of berries and booze.
The taste of it: surprisingly mellow and light on entering the tongue, satisfactorily full on the palate, merrily leaving its tracks all over the mouth, tingling the senses from the start. Very snappy, this, brimming over with tasty, cherry brandy flavor, figgy, bready, grapey. Sits prettily on the palate, spilling over with juicy, boozy goodness.

2333,"2004-09-11",3.7,"2003.  Deep, dark red with few tan bubbles leaving little head.  Intense aroma that is sweet, roasted and spicy.  Toasted bread, bittersweet chocolate, alcohol, plum, caramel, raisin, vanilla, molasses and probably a few others.  The body is not as full as I would expect from a 10.6% Belgian, but what is there is soft and fairly supple.  The flavor is enjoyable but not altogether mind-blowing.  Slightly sweet with tasty bits of fruit and malt.   There is some spice elements, though they are fairly subdued.  The roasted/toasted character is strong and fairly enjoyable.  It helps to balance the sweetness quite well.  The yeast element is good, but not quite as developed as I tend to enjoy.  Given a few more years, the AleSmith Belgian yeast may evolve into a truly brilliant strain.  Good, but Id like to see it in a couple more years.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

 Rating # 400
Vintage 2003   -   Pours with very little head; but a cream colored ring of frothy bubbles does rest atop the dark tawny mahogany body. The aroma is thick with sweet and fruity malts. Long intense notes of plums, apricots, toffee, caramel, and molasses come to light with each intoxicating breath. 
Deep woody oak notes are abundant in the flavor! Its slightly toasty, a small hint of smoky wood chips. Exceptionally fruity flavor; large submissions of dates, plums, caramelized & sautéed sweet red apples, large hints of brown sugar; but still, I pick up on that smoky fresh molasses presence! Some spicy notations as well; clove, sage, and black pepper are most noted. With the small exception of not being as sweet, this Grand Cru very much resembles an aged Port! Rather yeasty, but going with theme, its like a freshly baked pumpernickel bread yeastiness, toasty and refined. 
 The palate is full and syrupy, I would like more effervescence from this beer though. This Ale just seems a tad bit stagnant for its style, so a fractional loss of points here. The finish is warming, sticky, fruity, and sweet: its like a Christmas fruit basket of dried dates and apricots and figs.. all those delicious dark fruits.

Very creamy and soft, with vanilla-bourbon characteristics on the tongue, really almost as much a barley wine as a Belgian strong to my tongue.  Low carbonation and dry, quick finish.  A bit of a letdown, this was my first Alesmith; but really, its very good and I just had very high expectations.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
2333,"2004-02-16",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 17, 2004 2003: Cloudy deep brown body, small light brown film consisting of ultra-sticky tiny bubbles. Aroma is deep maltiness, fruity (raisin, prunes), chocolate, caramel, earthy, notes of dirt and alcohol. A bit of a let down on that department, not to intense nor complex, this could have been made by any belgian brewery. Taste gets a little more serious, tons of malt in there, smoky honey and maple, chocolate, caramel. A good earthy profile too accompanies the woody sphere. Quite complex with a very mild bitterness and an alcohol bite. Medium body, silky smooth, creamy. As this is my first Alesmith, it's definitely not up to my expectations from this highly acclaimed brewer which seemed (reading other reviews) to brew beers made just for me. It apparently is not the case, but I'll gladly give a try to their other products despite having to lay down 10$ on each of those big ones. CHeers Rodolito!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
2333,"2004-01-24",4.1,"(2003 Vintage) Pours a clear dark ruby with a minimal tan head. It clings to the glass not in typical beer fashion as lacing, but rather it exhibits legs like a big Cabernet. The aroma is sweet, caramel, and fruity. The flavor is also sweet caramel with some nutty/woody flavors developing mid-taste. The flavors mix and mingle in the mouth and keep exposing new dimensions of depth. The roasted malt flavor is the most surprising. The body is medium-full, almost creamy. The alcohol is hidden; the only noticeable effect is a slight numbness in the mouth. Overall an excellent Belgian style ale. This one should really cellar well and I will need to revisit it in a year or so. Yum.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"

Malts are fruity (bananas, peaches and raisins) bready and sweet. Very well balanced. Extremely smooth, nearly creamy taste. Touches of must and wood, vanilla and caramel. Some sherry and wine like characters are here as well. The 10% alcohol is very well hidden. Flavors of figs and plums come out as it warms, and I swear it get even smoother tasting. Nice beer.

Some clove. Fruits again, more banana.  Very creamy, but crisp. Thick body with a bit of an alcohol bite finishing it off. Definately warms you up a bit. Very nice Belgian though.

Initial aromas of blueberries and fruit, but as it warms the malt kicks in. Aromas of caramel, toffee and hint of alcohol. First sip reveals a smooth and refined brew. As this warms the flavors just keep coming. Light malt sweetness starts with rich flavors continuing throughout the quaff. Light bittersweet chocolate mixed with a cream caramel.

2333,"2004-01-02",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 7, 2004 1/2/04.  Poured out of 750 mL bottle, bought at A & J Liquor in Covina, CA 12/22/03.  2000 Vintage.  My first beer of the New Year, and I wanted to make it a special one.  This beer pours a dark resinous amber brown, mostly transparent body, with little head left in it.  Not much real lacing either, but the tiny outline on the edges of the glass struggles mightily to make lovely patterns of carbonation bubbles as you tilt the glass back and forth.  Even without much going on, it still looks pretty damn stately in the glass, and the body looks very full, lending a maple syrup appearance to the whole thing.  The aroma is fantastic-- a little bit of buttery sourness and fruit (certainly recalling the cidery, citrusy elements of other Belgian ales), resin, some rich caramel like an aged barley wine, and some drying vinous notes to go along with the subtle hints of dark unsweetened chocolate.  Delightful.  Initial taste reveals wonderfully (but unsurprisingly) full mouthfeel, silky smooth texture with a directness and crispness to everything that makes it all feel so carefully crafted and controlled.  The flavors are not that prominent immediately, so it requires a little concentration to pick out whats going on.  If you sit and savor the beer, though, its fantastic in its simplicity.  Only a hint of sourness, and then lightly toasted yeast, tingly malt like a doppelbock, an undercurrent of alcohol warmth, and some raisin.  I still get a little bit of the unsweetened chocolate, but its mostly disappeared behind the caramel and yeast.  Alternately dry and mouth-wateringly rich finish, with mostly a tangy resinous and raisiny trace, and the toastiness is lovely.  Reminds me of the aged Hair of the Dog Golden Rose and especially the aged Fred that I had a few months ago.  Very elegant, very delicious stuff.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

The commercial description states that it's ""like a fine wine"" and I can see that comparision. this had to have been one of the smoothest beers I've ever had.  It had a light amber/yellowish appearance.  I could detect the aroma of apples, lemon  and cinammon and almost like a warm apple cider kind of feeling to it.

2333,"2003-07-29",4.6,"Vintage 2000. Today was my lucky day. I'm always looking around for this fine ale.

As I move on aside, there she was, '00 Grand Cru. Even at the 00 price of 9.99. Anyhow, it has aged gracefully. Slightly passed it's prime but still  legendary. Nicely conditioned with lingering head. Clear, deep color. Alcohol dominates the aroma, but plenty of fruit .. raison, plum.

From what I can ascertain from the local package store is that there seems to be a labeling problem that is delaying its shipment to Arizona, and Im mad a hell and Im not going to take it anymore, guess I will just order a case via the internet and be damned the expense.

The pour a deep lucent brown with ruby highlights, the head behemothic in size, spumescent in texture and a winsome light tan color, the lace a velum like sheet to conceal the glass. The nose has a deep malt walnut like sweet aroma, rich and full, fresh a treat for the eye, nose and palate. Start is creamy rich and sweet, top is moderate to full in feel and the finish spiny in its acidity, vinous, hop spicy and desert bone dry aftertaste, a real Hoot in my books.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
