1306,"2016-03-16",4.3,"BOD 2/3/16. Dark brown cola like pour that is clear and turns a beautiful garnet under intense light. Outstanding head volume and retention, world class lacing.

Outstanding nose of toasted malt with subtle notes of char and smoke over a caramel substrate with a dark fruit element, probably plum.

Almost medium body with a very smooth texture that has creamy aspects. World class carbonation with a nice effervescent middle and a rollicking finely bubbled prickly finish that tickles the tongue.

The flavor profile is quite outstanding. Intensity is moderate, complexity is outstanding and balance is perfect. In short, this tastes great but doesnt hit you with in your face flavor intensity. This is a malt forward beer that begins toasty, progresses to a moderate sweetness with strong caramel notes and a subtle molasses aspect then flows to the middle. The middle delivers just enough bitterness to perfectly balance with a pine and roast character that delivers a touch a char and a dose of smoke. These flavors slowly fade into the malty finish that brings a slight dryness and a hint of plum. Alcohol remains completely covered and a nut character emerges during the fade which also brings the strongest molasses aspects.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

The flavors are just as good. It's sweet and carries a good scotch ale flavor. The dark fruits really pull this together a bit. There is a sweet malt, a light caramel, and just a hint of metallic sweetness. The mouth feel is excellent. There is a nice creaminess and a soft carbonation that helps not seem a little thicker.

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a deep brown-copper color with a tiny tan colored head. The head fades very fast, leaving some foam islands on the surface of the brew and a tiny bit of lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is big and sweet with tons of caramel, toffee, and chocolate. Along with these sweeter aromas is a rather decent showing of a lightly roasted bready smell as well as some smells of yeast. A very light hop aroma of an earthy nature is there as well rounding out the smell nicely.

 Taste  The taste begins with a big sweet caramel and toffee flavor mixed with a roasted brown bread taste. Soon after, flavors of chocolate and a bit of some darker fruits of plum and prune come to the tongue sweetening the brew even further. Some cola like tastes later join in as well but at a loss of some of the toffee, diminishing the more buttery smooth sugar flavors of the brew. Toward the end, some hop flavors of an earthy and grassy flavor, as well as a bit of a oaky flavor, come to the tongue. The combination of flavors that is left at the end of the taste ends up leaving a quite sweet, roasty and malty flavor to linger on the tongue. 

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the averages to slightly thicker side in terms of thickness and creaminess with a carbonation level that is average. The added thickness of the brew is nice for all the roasted and sweet flavors of the brew although a bit less carbonation may have helped accentuate these flavors even more. 

 Overall  This is a sweet and malty brew for sure. A fantastic beer for a nice fall or winter day. Lots of sweet sugary taste with a nice brown bread flavor.","","Darkmagus82"

Very unusual aroma for a Scottish: coffee, hazelnut, plums, and raisins. There is a surprising grape sweetness at the end. Really something.

The taste is nutty like a brown ale. It has more berry sweetness with a touch of breakfast blend coffee. There is a cigarette ash finish but I think its because maybe I had a cigarette recently.

There?s a subtle undertone of berries with a slight alcohol, or maybe cough syrup is more appropriate. As it warmed up and settled, I could also pick up a trace vanilla and floral quality to it. It pours a dark brownish-red body with a lightweight, fizzy dark tan head. There?s not much head, and it recedes quickly to a thin ring with a wispy film and it leaves very little lace. The taste is a medium / medium-high sweetness with a slight bitter touch at the finish. The body is a medium / medium full richness with an above average, soft carbonation that has an oily and slick texture. The mouth is mostly a juicy and fruity feel with some grass. The finish is a roasty grain with a resin texture. The mellow resin hangs around a bit for the aftertaste with some figs and candy grape (borderline grape cough syrup).

1306,"2013-10-11",3.8,"The beer pours a nice dark and syrupy ruby-brown with a little head of miniscule, light tan bubbles that fizzle away to the smallest of rings around the glass. In body, the beer is clean of particles, but dark and a little murky, like looking through a bottle of Aunt Jemimas syrup. On the nose, the beer smells richly of bready malts. Brown sugar-coated raisins mingle with soft peat smoke and light bacon scents atop the rich, caramel bread smell which gives this beers nose a backbone. There is a light touch of sweet alcohol, and definite rich biscuit, chocolate, and bread notes as the beer warms. On the tongue, this beer tastes richly sweet with malts. The beer finds balance through light bitter roast and light savory bacon flavors from the smoked malt. Ever-so-soft herbal hops also gently bitter the tongue beneath all of the other tastes, while slightly cloying alcohol does touch on the middle of the sip. On the tongue, the beer feels medium in body with a lightly chewy, yet velvety mouthfeel and a very soft carbonation and prickle on the tongue. As the beer warms, the mouthfeel seems to thin out a little, which is too bad. The flavor begins as sweet raisins and light bacon and peat smoke, slowly moving slightly towards a cider-like flavor and then swiftly to warm caramel bread with a touch of cola. Faint herbal bitterness can be sensed throughout the sip, and the beer finishes with a nice long touch of bacon-like flavors and a touch of chocolate and bread. The aftertaste lingers with smoke and caramel sweetness while the tongue feels oddly scraped and dry. Slight maple syrup flavors can also be sensed. Overall, this is a nice beer with great malty complexity and a terrific transition of flavor as the beer warms. The closer you get to room temperature the more maple syrup notes you get from the malt, but you also get a touch more the herbal hops. A beer to try for sure.","Beverly, Massachusetts, USA","msnelling09"

1306,"2013-01-13",3.9,"Bottle.  Pours translucent brown with red and orange highlights. Little to no head.  Very light smell of malt with some roasted characters and a slight sourness.  Taste is basically malt and hops.  A little roasty and a little bitter, in harmony.  Some bread and a little sweetness underneath.  Mouthfeel is medium with some slickness.  Not terribly complex but smooth and well balanced.  Makes a good casual drinking beer.  Very good.

1306,"2012-02-21",3.4,"UPDATED: MAR 1, 2012 From notes.  First reviewed 12/22/2008.  Poured from a bottle into a pint glass.

Robert The Bruce has a very deep coffee color, with a hint of cherry. A small head quickly recedes but leaves some small lacing on the glass.

The malt, which is heavily toasted, is the most obvious smell. It is smokey, with some light caramel and toffee notes.

Some nice smokey toffee notes lead out the flavor, with almost no fruit or alcohol present. A nice spiciness fills the middle of the sip, with a brief hop introduction, and then more malt at the end. 

This has a medium body, but the sweetness makes it feel heavier. Medium carbonation. Slightly chewy, due to the malt. 

Even with the heavier body, this is a reasonably drinkable ale. The balance of malt and hops, with the malt pushing ahead, allow it enough sweetness to drink one or two easily. After that, the sweetness catches up to it, and the heavier body is somewhat prohibitive.

On cask 2/1/2011.  Served from a gravity pour cask into a pint glass at Fountainhead. (6/3/7/4/15)

On cask, Robert the Bruce pours a dark walnut brown with a ruby tint throughout. This looks more transparent than I remember out of the bottle. A rocky tan head does not retain very well and leaves no lacing to speak of.

Overall it is fairly soft on the nose, with the various aromas blending together. Caramel malt, some dark and orchard fruits, lightly spiced, with soft earthy hops. 

The flavors smooth together, losing some of their crisp edges. Smooth caramel malt, with a hint of cocoa, raisins and plums all carry the load. A soft spice kick and a light finish of earthy hops and peat.

This drinks fairly light on cask. The feel is creamy, more from the beer than from the carbonation, which is obviously not present. 

This was very easy to put down. The carbonation was delicate and light, and the beer itself is solid.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

This beer is a display of fine toasted malts at their best. I would have rated it a little higher if it was in the 8%+ range of ABV, but I wouldnt hold that against it....its a near-perfectly concocted brew that is every-so-smooth to consume.","West Virginia, USA","bstroh707"
1306,"2011-12-07",3.7,"I received a 12oz bottle in a trade with a guy named Robert. I poured it into a tulip glass.

Appearance: Opaque maroon so dark it borders on black. Forms a large, tan, creamy head which retains and laces well.

Smell: Subdued nose of bready malt, dark fruits and a hint of smoke.

Taste: Robert The Bruce is a Scottish style ale, not to be confused with the stronger, more robust Scotch or ""Wee Heavy"" ales. Considering this is a Three Floyds beer, its surprising they didnt opt for the latter style. So what we have is a beer thats definitely tasty and well balanced, but seems like so much more could be done.

It begins with pretty big fruity/malty flavors - the same youd get in a Belgian dark ale, but without the actual Belgian quality. I notice a cherry sweetness and tartness is quite prominent, followed by a plum flesh. The back end is slightly bitter with bakers chocolate and toasted malt. The finish is slightly sweet, but leaves a clean aftertaste. A good palate as a whole, but its not amazing and unique like most beers from this brewery.

Mouthfeel: Thick, soft, wet, cold, low carbonation, creamy texture with a mostly clean aftertaste.

Drinkability: What Three Floyds Robert The Bruce lacks in energy is makes up for in drinkability. The thick density and creamy texture make it extremely smooth. The 7% ABV actually seems a little high as there doesnt seem to be a lot of energy or weight to this palate. This beer probably works better as a meal companion rather than a beverage on its own. Still, its not a challenge to drink at all and would make a good introduction to the Scottish style.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

1306,"2011-11-21",3.4,"The experience starts with bitter malt and a bit of peaty aroma.  As a Boilermaker, it saddens me to say that this is the perfect color of cream and crimson I have ever seen (such a shame from a Northern Indiana brewery).  The head requires a violent pour to generate and it doesnt last long before retreating to the sidelines.  Clean malt character on the tongue is punctuated by cherry candy, caramel, and a touch of toffee.  Sweet throughout and only slightly balanced by a low lying bitterness either from the roasted malts or hops.  A bit cloying at the end, but perhaps that is to be expected from the bigger Scottish ales.  The medium bodied and lightly carbonated beer goes down smooth but leaves behind a slightly sticky coating.  Quite a nice beer.  Well made - as I always expect from Three Floyds - but not as good as the Three Floyds obsessed raters would suggest.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","GlassBrass440"

1306,"2011-06-03",3.5,"UPDATED: SEP 23, 2012 My feelings about this beer are just as complex as the beer itself. It is really, really well brewed, with a perfect body and a lot of complexity in terms of aroma and the resulting flavors. There are plenty of chocolate and malts, which are decently roasted, with some hops as well. The result is a very sweet beer, perhaps too sweet for me, whose overall feel I could only describe as gingerbread-esque. I am not familiar enough with the style to assess whether Three Floyds nailed it or not (it would appear so, judging by the fact that its currently the top-rated beer on the style); Ill just say its a very well done brew, regardless of its intention, that is just not for me. Try it, though, because I can see how this is a malt-lovers (and, may I add, chocolate-lovers) delight, as FFF claims it is.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

Small amount of dark white head that dissipates quickly. Dark nut brown in color. 

Scent is very malty. Caramel and roasted nuts. Cant smell much from the hops on this one. Something else is there too. Maybe raisins...

Medium bodied with a creamy texture, overly fizzy carbonation and a slightly longer than average coffee finish.

The first sip bursts with complex malt flavors, and the chocolate makes an appearance.  A tiny hopy presence smooths out the chocolate up front and leads into more standard malts, as bread and caramel fill the palate next.

Flavors follow suit, with some of that tootsie roll character initially, but this is quickly edged out by the more dominant roasted peanut and caramel flavors.  The chocolate returns on the finish, but its far more dry here, with a possible hint of smoke as well.

The look: Clear light ruby-bown topped by an off-white ring of foam
In long: Light nose of fruity caramel.  Taste is straightforward caramel, toffee, dried fruits, milk chocolate, green peas (not unpleasant), tree roots.  The beer is sweet but doesnt feel heavy thanks to the woody hops that dry it out nicely.  Medium body and medium carbonation.  Name after a former King of Scotland, Englands northern suburb.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Dried fruit aroma - prunes, raisins, dates - chocolate, cherries, coffee. Flavor more of the same - this is definitely mellowed, but Ill rate the beer Im having, not the beer I think it is.

There isnt a hint of hop presence.  The flavor has a huge malt backbone, with just the right amount of carbonation.  Its got a great roasty profile, while remaining fairly sweet.

The aroma is delightful malt, butterscotch, malt, Borkum Riff, malt, chocolate, malt, a bit of hops. I dipped my nose into the froth trying to take it all in.  The first sip is a little death. Complex but satisfying flavors of roasted malt, butterscotch, coffee, cocoa, and a subtle smack of hops on the back of the tongue.  I should drink nothing but this stuff .

A foamy, medium sized caramel cream head, amber brown in color, medium appearing body, light carbonation.  A nice, smooth and good flavored feel with some minor carbonation.

I love FFF for adding hops to everything, especially the styles that generally dont have an abundance...like this one. They really make the boring styles something to behold. The flavor is similar to the aroma, but I get more of a light roasty chocolate than I did before sipping. A nice scotch flavor and lots of smooth English maltiness resembling ginger bread cookies.

The taste is sweet, malty and fruity as well. Some of the fruit seems to be hop derived, though the hops are fairly subtle here. There is a hint of roast malt in the finish, which adds a nice stylistic touch. This is quite a malty brew, with notes of caramelized malt, cherries, and raisins.

1306,"2008-11-27",3.8,"Admittedly, sometimes half the fun in discovering new beers is the names that they are given. Granted a name doesnt make a beer, but if it is enough to intrigue and catch my attention, it has a good chance of going home with me, for better or for worse. Vice versa, a plain and unassuming bottle of beer has just as much potential of grandeur as a funky bottle, but lets face it, we are a visual people and what catches our eye first is more likely to be our first consideration. While Robert the Bruce ~ Scottish Style Ale wasnt a beer I picked up myself, but instead one that was shared with me by a fellow beer geek and friend, I nonetheless love the name and find myself rolling the r’s and saying its name with a silly grin on my face. Im also easily amused, but that is beside the point. Scottish Style Ales are a newly budding love of mine so I look forward to seeing how Robert the Bruce fairs.Three Floyds Brewing is one of those elusive and magical breweries who craft mind-blowing beers but also play hard-to-get. Robert the Bruce poured an earthen amber with faint ruby-red hues glinting where the light shines through. A small head fades into miniscule puddles of foam and bubbles, though she does puff up rather nicely with a swirl or two. Her nose is light nibs of chocolate, sweet caramel and toffee with crisp apples and spice notes. Candy apples? Not as heavy as a scotch ale, I am pleasantly surprised by just how light and effervescent Robert the Bruce is. She practically explodes in my mouth with bubbly wonder. Clean with a sweet finish which leaves a thin film of caramel and toffee in my mouth. As she warms, her mouthfeel grows ever chewier with soft and warm doughy pie-crust notes while the apples and spice linger in the background. Pleasantly thick without being cloyingly sweet or overbearing, instead creating a well-balanced medley of caramel, toffee, apples and spice wrapped up in warm bread with pie-crust notes.Robert the Bruce was an excellent if not a bit different scotch ale, though my range of experience with this beer style is still rather limited. Hopefully it will continue to grow exponentially while at the same time I savor that which I have enjoyed. A good Scottish Style Ale from Three Floyds Brewing. Hopefully, I shall come across another bottle of Robert the Bruce so I can savor her kilted depths once more.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

1306,"2008-08-31",3.3,"UPDATED: SEP 1, 2008 roasted malt aroma borders on dark caramel but stays this side of the line.  color is dark for the style as well.  flavor is sweeter then expected, and lacks the alcoholic edge i expect from a scottish ale.  to its own merit, this also means its hiding its 7%+ very well.  roasted malts flavor border on brown ale-like, as i suspected from the nose.  lacks the hop sledgehammer id expect from FFF...hops are present enough to keep things balanced though.  i think i expect a slightly more syrupy mouthfeel, while this isnt totally straight in that regard, there is only but a touch of thickness available to the drinker.  i dont know that chocolate malts belong in a beer this style, while this is nearly a failure for a scotch ale, its a highly sessionable beer that goes down like a brown ale.  amongst all this, its interesting this is one of the handful of beers that FFF makes year round.","River Grove, Illinois, USA","satan165"

The beer tastes almost like a Belgian ale at times. Lightly dry aftertaste. Medium body. Crisp but low in carbonation. Easy to drink. Three Floyds Robert the Bruce is boring but not unpleasant.

1306,"2008-01-14",3.5,"My first Scottish Ale.  Pours a dark brown color that glows deep amber when backlit.  A small, dense, foamy, off-white head shows good retention and leaves behind small spots of lacing.  The aroma is very malty and fruity, with little hop character showing through.  Chocolate and caramel malts are accompanied by notes of figs, plums, and a dash of cream.  Vanilla and almonds emerge as the beer warms considerably.  Minimal floral hops complete the nose.  The flavor is very sweet, with malts obviously running the show here.  Caramel, figs, and chocolate covered raisons kick things off, followed by that same nutty, almond and vanilla component.  The medium body is just slightly syrupy and a tad bit over carbonated.  Some alcohol shows on the fleeting, dark fruity finish.  This feels like a cross between a nut brown ale and a dopplebock to me.  Interesting, though not overly impressive.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Nose is full of roasted barley and nutty caramel. Hardly any sweetness which I must say is surprising. Flavor is sweet and mellow with an almost creamy mouthfeel. Lots of malts going on here. Can taste the hops in the finish but they do not take over the beer like some from this brewery. This is my first rated scottish ale.

Similar in taste and style to the Germans,s malty Heller Bock.  This beer has an excellent aftertaste.  One of my favorite brews from Three Floyds.

1306,"2007-06-10",4.3,"Appearance: Pours out a clear dark mahogany body with a thin, tan-colored head that dissipated fairly quickly.

Smell: The aroma is dominated by a heavy, sweet maltiness, mostly caramel, but one can also find some chocolate and cookie crumbs in the scent, too. Also, theres some hints of smoke and spruce twigs.

Taste: A clean, smooth flavor of toffee with heavy notes of chocolate and bread crusts. As the beer warms, the sweetness takes on a nutty aspect akin to eating sugar-coated walnuts. A trace of floral hops streak across the tongue late in the taste. For all its initial sweetness, this beer does finish semi-dry with a slight bitterness.

Had this on tap at the Vintage Estate Wine & Beer in Boardman OH.  The pour is brownish and clear. Has a tan head that fades to a froth after a few moments. Very little aroma, cant smell barely anything but perhaps some raosty ness. The initial flavor impact is medium high bitterness.  Has a little carbonation. To an extent it is a bit malty roasted bitterness. There is a linger that hangs on the back of your throat after the initial swig. I cant get over the medicinal qualities of this brew. Strong, apparently high alky content from the flavors, alky is not well hidden. Not impressed. Overall, except for the bitter alky attributes, this beer is not tooooo bad.

Robert the Bruce poured a deep dark mahogany that was surprisingly clear when held to the light. Half-finger off white head that faded quickly to a thin consistent coating.

The smell is good although a little on the weak side. There is an abundance of toasted malt. This is followed up by some dark fruit with a touch of sweetness.

The taste comes out as a smooth toasted grain followed by a slightly bittersweet coffee. The bitterness fades but a small amount sticks around. This isnt one of the most complex beers Ive ever had but it is enjoyable.

Medium bodied and smooth. Leaves a nice little carbonation tingle on my tongue after the swallow.

Drinkability is good for a 7% brew, The smoothness and medium body lets you drink a few. The taste doesnt hurt either.

1306,"2007-02-08",4.7,"I didnt know what to expect from this one but I found out. The aroma is very mild; very. However when caught has a sour note to it. It pours into a glass a medium-dark golden orange with a good amount of head; almost none. The flavor is also mild but in a very good way. The taste is malty and crisp. The in mouth feel is more medium than heavy or light The finish is very smooth and lingering which is another good quality of it. Super slight chocolate undertones to balance the maltiness. Overall a super brew once again raising my hopes for DarkLord day. My palate accepts this brew with the full conviction of my rating but consider me as the X factor as I may have a slightly different taste for brews. 3Floyds has it going good! Also Im trying some right now but that is not the sole reason for this seemingly high score from me. It just fits my tastes.","Canton, Ohio, USA","KiDAcE"

When young, theres a bit too much of the candy sugar/imitation maple syrup character that often mars American scottish ales....but its not so strong here that it hides the wondefully natural caramel notes that are the highlight of this brew.

Creamy rich round malt, accented by a bit of earthy (smoke? nahh), and more hops than usual in the style.  Lightly fruity malty finish.  Creamy subdued balanced malty aftertaste.

Poured an opaque brown, but appeared reddish when I held it up to the light.  A small amount of tan head with limiting staying power.

The aroma was of first alcohol, then light hop-esters, and then caramel malt.  I was surprised the caramel smell wasnt more potent.

Flavor is of fairly light caramel-malt notes with some oakiness.

Carbonation was very fine, which is good, but I still felt the mouthfeel to be a bit thin.

This beer is very drinkable.  Im surprised its not bolder, given the other offerings from this brewery.  I found this beer to be pretty mild-mannered for a Three Floyds product.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

Flavor profile is similar, except the fruitness is less pronounced and the hops are more apparent.  There is a definite toasty, nutty flavor.  Finish lacks the complexity I hoped for, and its a bit watery.  Good carbonation.  Overall, a nice, drinkable beer, but not very complex.

It is moderately sweet, but mostly generic with just some darker/roasted malt in it.  The finish is chalky and has an almost unpleasant bitterness to it that doesnt fit with the beer.  Maybe thats just some of the peat-like characteristics coming through, but it still seems a bit off. This beer has a mild level of carbonation, a medium body, and is fairly smooth.

1306,"2006-09-30",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 13, 2007 Walking into the Great American Beer Festival for the first time had all the effect of walking into Imperial Rome.  It was bustling, loud, raucous, yet refined.  It was the pinnacle of beer civilization where tradesman from all over the land could gather and share the treasures they had made.  Though the drinkers were from all walks of life, they shared a common thread in their adoration of a good beer.  It was a concerted effort by an immensely eclectic group to enjoy beer  an event worthy of comparison to the rise and fall of the peoples of Campania.  It seems that in the dizzying glee of the moment leading up to that grand entrance I had forgotten to bring any navigational tools.  Before me were aisles and aisles thronged with semi-sober patrons, outnumbered only by the variety of beer, and I had no clue where to go or how to get there.  So I did what any good bard or merchant would do.  I wandered.  And the first booth of interest we came across was Three Floyds.  The line was blissfully short and the drinkers blissfully ignorant.  It was an ideal opportunity.  I ran up to the booth and saw four beers before me and, not knowing which to try first I asked.  The representative sighed and looked around and said Maybe the Bruce.  And what a fine beer to start the night with!  It has a strong name, a strong brewery behind it and I generally like Scottish styled beers.  However, the sickly orange light of the convention center kept me from seeing any color in the beer, and the tiny tasting glasses rebuffed the formation of any head.  Still, it appeared to be a mostly translucent head with a faded wood color and no head to speak of.  I wrapped my meager tasting glass around my nose like an oxygen mask and took in a beautiful blend of Scottish and sweet.  Peat and hearty vegetables like carrot, potato and yam blend with apples and the smell of a sugar glaze.  The taste, too, played true to Three Floyds reputation for quality by emphasizing its sweeter side with strong licorice tones.  The most amazing malts Ive ever tasted in a beer features prominently producing a lovely balance between the savory Scottish spirit of the beer and the less expected sweet bits.  Robert the Bruce in name and in taste was a fitting beer to start the festival with.  A fine way to acquaint myself with Three Floyds too.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

1306,"2006-07-11",4.0,"A tremendous beer done in a rather unique style. A reasonable amout of hoppiness, combined with caramel and multiple heavy fruits. Its spicy, yeasty flavor is quite impressive. The bitter aftertaste is welcoming and does not impede upon some of the more slight flavors.  It is certainly difficult to note the amount of alcohol in this beer. I find that this beer is best consumed near 45 degrees fahrenheit to ensure the consumer samples every aroma.","Fleetwood, Pennsylvania, USA","mhoster56"

Fairly tame aromas of roasted malts, dark chocolate, caramel and a touch of peat smoke. A pleasingly full, creamy mouthfeel is noted just being shy of oily. Well balanced and quite sweet flavors of dark chocolate, roasted malts, nuts, raisins along with some smokey wood undertones. Interestingly enough the finish demonstrates some mild hoppy bitterness unusual for the style, but seems to work fine. Cuts through any residual sweetness nicely. An admirable Scottish Ale, although a bit reserved.","St Augustine, Florida, USA","mike mcneil"

6-pack from the brewpub. Pours a cloudy dark copper with a small white head. The aroma is weird. Very, very juicy with hints of peach, orange, toffee, and miscellaneous fruit. This is not as hoppy as I recall, but it has been a great long while. It is still highly hoppy for the style. Palate is smooth with a flavor of cherry wood, peach, toffee, and vanilla.

Flavor, however, highlights a sweet coffee/chocolate flavor that is not heavy as in a stout or porter, but definitely present.

1306,"2005-08-06",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 1, 2006 On tap at the Blind Pig, Champaign, IL. This is one of my favorite Three Floyds brews given the hops isnt as ""prolific"" as it is in many of their other offerings. The malt and vanilla flavors, and what a wine drinker would refer to as ""toasty oak,"" blend nicely. I didnt pick up the chocolate noted in the description, so Ill be sure to look out for this next time. As a final comment, think this beer could be improved by upping the alcohol level a few percent. RERATE: I must be growing more generous in my days on this website. Increasing the overall by 2. This beer has emerged as my favorite Three Floyds beer. If given the choice, Id rather drink this than DL, although DL is a better constructed beer.","Illinois, USA","Philip"

Toasty flavor,  tingling effervescence on the tongue that seemed to mute the flavor somewhat.  Dominated with malt, very little hops.   I was hoping that the flavor would run more robust spicy dark malts in the forefront, but blended addition of pale malts seem to dominate.

Only a minute after Ive made myself comfortable a steaming cup of java and a delectable caramel and chocolate confectionary delight is set before me.

Some more spicyness - pure cinnamon, maybe, thats bark too. Finishes a bit metallic, the malts not resurfacing again. Thick, nearly viscous, not thin at all. Bit harsh aftertaste.

1306,"2005-01-25",3.8,"Deep scarlet brown color with a thin dark tan head that slips away leaving a light broken skim and thin collar. Lacing sticks in minimal thick strings.

Aroma is of maple syrup and deep dark caramel, nice deep sweetness to it but lacks a bit of strength. Notes of char or smoke leak out.

Taste has a premium maltyness to it engaging an interesting little play between sweet caramel and roasted grains with the roastyness winning out in most sips. Pale leafy hop notes and touches of char bring through to the finish in a well mannered disposition and placement that happens late across the back of the palate. I like that part alot, nice finisher.

Feel is a solid medium body maintaining a decent creamyness and malt laden thickness that moderately coats with a smooth left over oilyness. Finish is nice with a lingering char and leafy, deep pine hop tone.

A favorable beer that can be handled fairly easily, but after a couple it may start to effect the noggin as the 9% is hidden very well.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

The lacing is smooth and Slick with a mid-body and oily mouthfeel. bitter sweet chocolate after taste.  Caramel comes forward as do the hops as this warms.  The slightly higher 7% alcohol gives this and extra something, as does the adequate and not overpowering carbination. This is an amazing brew, being more of a malt guy, not a hop head.

1306,"2004-10-12",4.2,"Hazed brick. Fluffy, off-beige rocky foam. Gorgeous aroma of beet sugar, assorted berries, roasted hazelnuts, and unspent grains. Slightly nutty with cocoa-dusted malt hulls and some Crystal firmness. Puffy, yet perfectly creamy carbonation. Beefy malts immediately add girth to the already-puffy body. Malts turn immensely bready and gain more depth from the cane sugar and cocoa roughness. Minimal earthiness, other than a mild mossy twang, gives way to a glut of chocolate. Chocolate steadily richens, overriding the splash of plummy fruitiness, malt-enhancing acidity and oxidation, which accentuate every aspect of the malt. Remarkably fresh spent malt flavor and creamed coffee underpins the everlasting cocoa-dusted crushed grains flavor, which lasts well into the finish. Surprisingly tame hop profile for this brewery, which makes way for a flavorsome showcase of their complex, well-extracted, high-lovibond malts. And to boot, this is worlds better now that its bottle conditioned and no longer contract brewed in MN.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Tastes are mostly of malts, with chocolate espresso notes as well.
Yeasty to a fault, but a clear brew all the same. The flavors of the yeast are there, but none of the cloudiness associated with it.
Caramel candies and warming alcohols make up the remainder of the flavors. Very warming, slight, brief but fleeting hops bitterness at the very end of the beer. Finishes somewhat sweet, but well balanced. It could use a touch more hops, however, for the style.

I guess shipping can take its toll :P  Pours an elegant, crystal clear-but-dark brown that shines red when held up to light.  Very neat.  Aroma is very mild, but thats probably due to the utter lack of a head I got.    A vigorous swirl at half glass pulls up dates, chocolate, smoke and malt.  Nice.  Flavor is mellow and rich- chocolate again, malt, smoke, dark bread, caramel.  Again, its a bit flat, and   the finish seems to coat my mouth substantially.

1306,"2004-07-31",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2008 This one surprised me. Very pretty deep Bock-ish coloring. At first smell, like a Brown ale. First taste is the same. Once I get past the dark malts, the same hops that are used in the AK are used here, though to a lesser degree. This is how a dark malt based beer should taste. No weird grainy tastes, just the finer nuances of the malts, complemented with a luxurious hop complex. Simply wonderful.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"

Major thanks to TheBeerGod for sending me this brew not once but twice! The first bottle was murdered when it was violently pushed out of my closet by a bottle of DFH WWS. Mike caught wind of the tragedy and sent me a back up bottle,  Thanks Very Much, Bro! 
 Aged for 7 months.
Pours with a deep and rich cherry wood amber body. The head is a creamy tan cap that sits atop. Aroma is malty.. Full with  thick fruits and butterscotch and toffee. Notes of apple, pears, peaches, apricots, plums, figs, and a toasty toffee malt are in abundance here! A hint of coffee, lightly kilned chocolate malt adds some smokiness as well. Those toasted malts and ripened fruits are insanely delicious! Wow, the body is oily and buttery delectable and hospitable!

Slightly buttery up front, but a little disappointing in the mouth-feel body category. Head disappeared rapidly. Subtle raisin flavor. Back of the tongue bitterness. As this warms up, I get a better feel for the maltiness. This one really should be  slurped at room temperature.

Good creamy looking off-white head.  Aroma of roasted barley, caramel and light smokiness.  Flavor is immediately dry of roasted barley, medium dry chocolate malt and light hops in the background.  Heavy roast flavor really keeps this beer dry with the chocolate trying to add sweetness.  There is a decent complexity and you can really pick out the different malts, but I just wish it was a tad bit sweeter.  The beer was very clear and filtered which seemed to detract from the flavor.  No wateriness at all, and  a medium body.  Lots of bitterness on the finish emerges after warming.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Thick malty aroma; dark fruit masked by a slightly chocolaty and very light coffee malt.  Hop aroma seems to pick up as the glass warms. Has more hops in taste than aroma. The hops taste flowery... malt adds some caramel and raspberry esters. Somewhat creamy texture, but a bit of a carbonation burn.

Color is similar to before, very clear.  Fantastic light beige head and wonderful  lacing.  Aroma is getting a bit oxidized, actually a bit pleasant in that aspect.  Still richly malty, strange little bitter bite in the first few swallows, not really like a hop bitterness.  Tasty caramel behind the oxidation.

Aromas of dark fruit, malt, and a hint of alcohol waft from my glass.  The taste is sweet, malty and fruity as well.  Some of the fruit seems to be hop derived, though the hops are fairly subtle here.  There is a hint of roast malt in the finish, which adds a nice stylistic touch.  This is quite a malty brew, with notes of caramelized malt, cherries, and raisins.  This is most definitely a good straight forward example of a Scottish ale. Sampled draft at the BreweryAnother great interpretation of a traditional beer done by 3-Floyds.  Of course you can't expect 3-Floyds to leave well enough alone do you.  This beer is full bodied, malty, quite flavorful, with a bit of hop flavor.  Ah this is quite good.  Much more hop flavor than is typical, but quite subtle considering the overall malt character.

It's tasty enough but it lacks complexity and is a bit overly sweet for its thinnish texture. It just doesn't really grab my attention like I'd like it to.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Not anything like most other Scottish ales which I find too malty and sweet. This one is really quite nice in my opinion. Really fresh tasting.

It kinda looks like thick paint all swirled together on a palate where at points you see darker or redder and othes wher it isnt quite so clear what colour it is. The nose is sweet with a noticable amount of hops but still sort of sublte. In the taste there is definately malts and hops and feel of constant quilibrium. Medium sized head that fades but leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. Medium body. Overall, I was very impressed.

1306,"2003-09-09",4.0,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2005 Sweet, full, smooth, and delicious. That was my old rating and memories of drinking it from the Ulm bottles a way back when... (when I would drink rum with it, anyway) ... Anyway, I had one fresh from a tap at the brewery in Munster and it was a lot darker and maltier. It had more of a caramel/cocoa flavor and looked a lot darker as well. It definitely is better there. Also, I brought bottles from the brewery and it was actually different. Thats odd. The bottled beers seemed to be lacking the full punch in the mouth. Hmm. UPDATE: shared a couple pitchers with friends at the canopy club for the MMW show on november 13. excellent. a lot easier to go down. something was in the air, perhaps, but i never tasted robert the bruce as smooth and unoffensive as that. UPDATE: bottle... a little bit watery, but still excellent. mellow, grapefruit/floral punch that rides a creamy coffee/coco sweetness. its actually balanced nicely, despite a lack of something... finishes chalky? well, its a warmer. big, smooth, though i just want more. hmm. so, ill keep drinking. UPDATE 2/10/05: english pint / awesome, as usual. very smooth, very pretty (could be a little bit more active), very good flavor and aroma of caramel, toffee, and a little bit of hops. as exquisite as an afternoon tea yet the high alcohol still kicks me! uprated palate to cause an excellent score!","Petaluma, California, USA","steview"
1306,"2003-09-08",3.5,"I've been wanting to sample this one for some time.  Pours a dark ruby copper.  The dense tall off white head is mostly lasting with average lacing.  The nose is snickerdoodle cookies in a citrus grove, with spices one might find in a pumkin pie.  While evaluating the flavor it occurs to me that I don't have a fresh sample.  The balance is nice but it is kind of thin over all for the stlye.  Floral front is followed by a buttery middle and a peppery bitter finish.  The medium dry body is soft and finishes clean.  A good representation of the style, I'd like to re-rate a fresh sample.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"

1306,"2003-08-11",4.1,"Here's the backstory: We were on our way home from our first family vacation on North Carolina's Outer Banks. Through some freakish twist of fate, the hotel we'd booked for the night had rejected my checkcard despite plentiful funds, and visits to 5 local ATM's had only managed to net $20. So here I was, only $20 in hand, a half a tank of gas and a wife (Togbean) and 2 kids that needed a room for the night, dinner, and transportation from Maryland to Massachusetts the following day and with all this in mind, I bought a 6-pack of this beer. Priorities, people. Priorities. Hey, we can have family wire us some emergency cash in a few hours, but it's gonna be awhile before I see this beer in Massachusetts. But I showed restraint. There was a 6-pack of the Alpha King right next to this, and I passed. Now on to the rating!
This beer had a velvety light tan head. Mmmmmmm. Yummy yummy malty. Color like a good maple syrup. This beer politely askes permission to enter your mouth and is a perfect guest while visiting. The malts were deeply satisfying, and the hops were well balanced. The aroma, sadly, smells slightly sour. This was an important beer for me, as it helped me to really recognize a good malt flavor.","Belchertown, Massachusetts, USA","BtownBrewer"
1306,"2003-08-04",3.6,"On my afore mention trip to the Outer Banks, my husband 2 kids and I were on our way home, stoppe at the hotel in Maryland and they declined our card, couldn't even make a call to the bank to figure this one out on a Sat afternoon. After much scambling and a call to my moms, we were in our room calming the kids down. The husband headed out to the Super Wal-Mart passed on the way into town to write a check for some food and get some cash. On the way back he stopped to fill the gas tank and discovered that it was also a liquer store. Normally I would be piised that he spent, possibly, our only funds on BEER, but I've never been happier to see him walk in the door with a six pack. At the time, this was the best beer in the world and because it was in the right place at the right time it will always have place in my heart. It's a fine scottish ale. A step a bove the rest but not necissarily somethoing to write home to mamma about. I would drink it again any day.","Belchertown, Massachusetts, USA","TogBean"

(8/10/02) Light brown with healthy off-white head.  Sweet caramel aroma, with just a hint of hops sneaking in at the periphery.

Well balanced and relatively light on the tongue for a scottish ale.  Pretty good.

Very smooth and complex, I wish I had spent more time enjoying this and less time evaluating it.","Philadelphia, USA","Delbomber"
1306,"2001-06-10",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 30, 2003    A fantastic Scottish Ale... very malty with a strong carmel flavor. Loved it. Re-rate, 4/30: Had this one on hand pull for the first time ever and was truly impressed. Malty, malty, malty with notes of both dark malt (caramel, chocolate) as well as light grape/raisin notes. Amazingly soft mouth feel. Mildly hoppy, not terribly smokey. Fantastic for the style!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","fraternie"

1306,"2001-03-09",4.0,"Very smooth, quite drinkable.  Big malty caramel flavor that lasts from start to finish.  Mild hop flavor.  Proper carbonation (in my opinion) and a surprisingly clean finish for an ale.

Updated (5 minutes after the first rating) after realizing that this thing is 7.2% alcohol Id like to add that it amazingly smooth, the alcohol is not apparent at all.  Very nicely done.","Acworth, Georgia, USA","billb"
1306,"2000-12-12",4.1,"I agree with Oakes (on 2 points).
Yes, 3 Floyds does rule, and it
really is amazing that this Scottish
Ale had a firm hop bite and it 
seemed perfectly normal in this beer.
Still, plenty of malt body make this a
great Scottish ale with or without the hops.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
1306,"2000-11-17",3.8,"Three Floyds rules!  I just love how they can make a scottish ale this hoppy and still have you thinking that its true to style.  Or maybe its that youre too busy ordering another one to actually care.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
1306,"2000-11-14",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 20, 2004 The beer dispenses from the 12-ounce brown bottle a deep amber to almost brown color with a meaningful sized frothy head that slowly evaporates leaving a fine coating of lace upon the glass. Nose is sweet with malt, hints of hops and a bit of fusel alcohol, fresh and appealing, the start nicely malted and somewhat sweet, top is middling in feel to the palate. Finish is delightfully carbonated and the hops delectable in their spiciness, dry linger aftertaste, a fine drinking beer, just wish Three Floyds were more readily available here in Arizona.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"
