I was pretty excited to have this the same day it was canned. Taste the same as then, so I guess it doesnt need to be enjoyed right off the line. Hazy gold pour, thick sticky white head, great lacing. Aroma is big on tropical fruit -- I drank this with mango sticky rice from one of my old haunts in Ithaca, and theres totally something like a mango-melon marriage going on here. Hints of cat litter early on, but that gets swallowed up by the tropical cocktail. Moderate sweetness, very light bitterness - hazy juice ipa here for sure.

Flavor starts out with weak mango and pineapple. White bread, honey and maybe light grapefruit that lingers on the finish. Too malty to balance the hops, sweeter than I would have guessed. Carbonation is a bit over done with a lively feel. Body comes off a bit spritzy. The yeast seems tired and not developed. Have they pushed this yeast strain to the limit? Seems like Tree House now only wants to push out the beer because they cant keep up with production. Premature ejaculation.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

Ok, the name checks out (not that I thought it wouldnt).Lots of key lime, strong watermelon/honeydew and a big, honey-laden maltiness that easily balances things. Tangerine juice, mango and very light pineapple are all complemented by a fresh minerality that is a very pleasant house character of the yeast/water, just as it is with Hill. No resin, flaw, alcohol and a great balance between malt and hop with no resin. Good intensity to the nose, as well.Succulent malts are well-attenuated, and provide plentiful honey notes in concert with a tight carbonation. Pineapple, watermelon, lush vegetal greenery and light strawberry. Malts easily balance the relatively low bitterness and lime and pineapple linger pleasantly on the finish, with a touch of spiciness. Not really a standout in their insanely high quality arsenal, but I think thats much more about how high quality all of their beers are and less a comment on this particular one.

This was poured into a tulip.
The appearance lived up to its name, definitely orange haziness colored with a fingers worth of white foamy head that leveled off at a nice pace. Sly thin lacing forms around the sides evenly.
The aroma starts off with a bright and juicy orange juice, pulpy with big bitter balancing rind-like qualities. Sweet onion dankiness slides in for an extra ferocity of the aroma.
The flavor brings it all together bittersweet with a spectacular orange juice to sweet onion aftertaste. Excellent sweet to danky finish.

Some perfumy fruity hues, some very earthy almost dank hues. Very enjoyable nose. Taste is initially tropically fruity and hoppy with some resin and herbal notes developing. Dangerously drinkable at 8%. Mouthfeel is medium with low to medium carbonation. Aftertaste is citrusy initially, turning more towards a lingering darkness and finishes dry.

1186,"2016-05-24",4.5,"Au premier coup doeil, comme plusieurs produits issus de la même brasserie, la bière nest pas très appétissante. On reluque un liquide marécageux de couleur jaunâtre avec une petite mousse blanche qui laisse toutefois une fine dentelle derrière elle. Au niveau des autres sens par contre, cest magique. Des pêches, des ananas et dautres fruits tropicaux valsent dans les narines sans retenue. En bouche, cest tout aussi fruité as fuck avec un corps rondelet et un léger sucre résiduel qui naliène aucunement la ribambelle de fruits qui paradent sur le palais.

1186,"2015-11-21",3.4,"Milky pour yields a bright clementine, fully hazed appearance. Weedy, vegetal acridity in the early aroma; pulpy, dandelion glue, milkweed. Tropical fruits and pastry dough malts providing some calming sweetness, astringent green bitterness holding firm. It would seem to be violently rough, but its not, its just so grassy, so green. Moments of angel food cake and honeycomb become more common over time, theres enough balance here.

The flavor finds much of the same conflict, though leaning toward pulpy sweetness now and not so much to the pushy astringency. Unripe mango, sweet pine, white peach, green banana. Thin, sweet malts. The real issue might be the silty, mucky suspended yeast flavor; a mixture of wet clay, riverbed, chlorine. Mingling with the residual sugars, this sensation is extremely distracting, and very difficult to describe. 

Soft palate though highly carbonated, medium to heavy weight. Objectively desirable flavor and aroma components are undermined by the intangible mess of drinkability issues here; this is a prime example of the huge gap that exists between whats truly great and whats generally perceived to be great. Treehouse is a world-class brewery, but some of its offerings arent fun or easy to drink.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

1186,"2015-06-30",4.1,"Growler at home. Pours a murky, opaque apricot with a modest white head. Messy lacing coats the glass after a few sips. Citrus aroma--lots of orange, very fruity, a touch of passionfruit. Taste is siimilar; citrus, orange. An assertive bitterness. Soft, medium bodied, bitter finish.","Michigan, USA","Mr_Abner"
1186,"2015-06-19",3.8,"Pours golden hazy orange sunset with a sandy white head. Aroma brings a soft but prevalent hop oil with no bite and a touch of lime. The flavor brings tropical fruit and a juicy body, with the hop oil at the end for sure, but I dont love that ending the way I enjoy the beginning.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"

1186,"2014-10-05",4.2,"Growler cracked one day after filling. Pours hazy cantaloupe color with one finger of off-white head and great lacing. Aroma is sweet honey and melon with fragrant rose and lychee, and undercurrents of pine and dank marijuana. Taste is mega orange juice, grapefruit peel and candied melon, although more delicate and honeydew-like than cantaloupe. Some caramel malts. Clean, crisp finish of piney and woodsy hops with moderate booziness. Medium mouthfeel. Lingering bitterness. A bit aggressive and rough around the edges, but still really solid.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","dfroms"

1186,"2014-09-23",3.9,"Poured from growler into reservoir tip glass. Pours golden orange with a foamy white head. Aroma is all citrus, lots and lots of citrus. Taste is a citrus bomb with very little bite at the back end. Its very juicy, but somehow seems thinish. Its a good beer but not great. Light to medium body.","Willington, Connecticut, USA","bellco33"

1186,"2014-09-09",4.1,"Growler, pours hazy golden orange with nice medium sized white head. Aroma is amazing with grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, and orange sweat. Flavor was a little cheesy at first but as it warmed became more subtle and dank with orange, tropical hop, dank resinous. A little hot but not sweating it too much. Medium body. Paired with some silver haZe. Cheers","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"

Aroma of fruity and citrusy and floral hops, pale and caramel malts, and light dough. Flavor the same with a nice hoppiness. Average texture. A solid beer from Tree House. EDIT: April 2017.  Been a long time since Ive had this one.  Like almost all Tree House beers, it got better.  Its incredible how they just keep improving. 3.8 to 4.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
