Bottle: The aroma consists of light-moderate tropical fruits, citrus, lemon, faint dank hops, and grapefruit. It pours a hazy dull orange with a small white head that fades to a minimal film outlined by a thin soapy ring. The flavor starts with light tropical fruits and mild citrus.

Copper orange body with a half inch of head. Aromas include a bouquet of citrus and tropical fruits. Flavor is more of the same with pineapple, orange, mango, finishing with grapefruit zest.

3351,"2013-10-23",4.0,"In short: A aromatic citrusy hops fix at 3.5% abv!!! Thirst beer for the American hops lover.
How: Bottles 22oz, all consumed very fresh.
The look: Cloudy pale orange body topped by a medium white head with medium retention.
In long: The highly aromatic nose is bursting with citrusy hops (lots of lemons) as well as some flower petals. More aromatic hops in this baby than in most Double IPAs. Body has crisp crackery cereals, zero sweetness sensation, like some kind of crispy soda cracker. That backbone obviously makes the very bright hop bill shine. Lemon zest, white grapefruits, orange flesh, piney notes. Sharp bitterness of medium intensity. Extremely refreshing. Body is slender but never watery. This beer is crisper than crisp. Almost as good as their own Three Penny Especiale (a similar low-abv hoppy ale by Lawsons), although the fact that I had the Especiale on tap and Spring Fever from in bottle may have to do with me preferring the Especiale. Anyway, a wonderful lov abv hop fix. Loved that beer, Im glad I was able to have multiple Spring Fevers, maybe it is because of my weakened immune system, because of years of excessive drinking, Im no doctor.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Appearance : Clear pale yellow with small head.

Aroma : Big floral hops with light piny notes. Quite malty.

Taste : Malty with piny hops. Slightly resinous finish. Slightly oily and sticky hops. 

Palate : Average carbonation.

Overall : Interesting beer. Quite a lot of body. quite a lot of residual sweetness from the malt which is not a bad thing in such a light beer. Hop stickiness also adds some depth and some texture. Well balanced. Quite an interesting take at the low abv IPA.","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

3351,"2013-07-03",4.4,"I poured a 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. There was no freshness date. I bought it from a friend who traveled to the brewery (thanks, Jon!). 

Appearance: Dark orange or amber hue, almost brown. Hazy but translucent. Massive carbonation visible. Forms an average sized, white, frothy head which retains and laces well.

Smell: Strong, wonderful aroma of citrus fruit juice, especially orange. Minor pine notes as well.

Taste: Ive often scoffed at the notion of a ""session IPA"" or even when someone describes an IPA as ""sessionable."" Hops tend to be cloying, and you usually need a strong enough body to balance it out. To simply throw a bunch of hops into a sub 4% ABV beer would probably taste like hoppy water. I dont know how, but Lawsons Finest Liquids managed to figure out how to brew a beer with a genuine IPA taste, but keep the body amazingly light at only 3.8% ABV.

The beer begins on the milder side, with a gentle taste of citrus juice flavors. Theres a sweetness as well, but its restrained and not cloying. Reminds me of orange sherbet ice cream or some hard candy suckers. Theres a constant dry bitterness as well, but its not too intense until the beer reaches the apex, at which point the hops really come alive. The orange citrus and candy flavors become even stronger on the finish. This is a really delicious beer. Id drink it often if I could.

Drinkability: If you were to drink this beer blind you could easily peg it for a bigger brew. Ive had other beers of a comparable recipe whose bodies were thinner than this. While Lawsons Finest Spring Fever Session IPA is not exactly as hearty as an imperial stout, its just a bit bigger than youd think. The mouthfeel is fairly intense with a strong carbonation presence. Its easy to drink as it goes down smoothly. At only 3.8% ABV, this is most definitely a session beer, but even better than that - its a versatile beer. I could see this standing up to a lot of food, but just enjoying it on its own is satisfying enough.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Aroma brings out notes of pine, a little floral notes, and some soft biscuity malt. Flavour definitely isnt as hoppy as a normal strength IPA, with bitter herbal hops notes, a little citrus rind, and biscuity malts in the back. Quite astringent without being all that hoppy. Balanced well-enough, though definitely skewed towards the hops. Very easy to drink, but not the most interesting. Decent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

3351,"2013-05-15",3.5,"22 oz. bomber from PhillyCraft. Thanks again Vin! This one pours very pale yellow from the bottle, but has a nice golden color in the glass. A very fizzy white head settles rather quickly. The nose has some nice  green onion and pine notes with a touch of grapefruit in the background. Nice, but not as explosive as the Drakes Alpha Session that I matched it up against side by side. They actually both had a very similar aroma, just this one was more subdued. The flavor is very dry and hoppy with big time onion and pine, firm bitterness and just a hint of lightly grainy malt. I cant help but think of bong water when I drink this. Very nice and sessionable for sure, but I would have liked some more fruity hops to balance out the hop character a bit.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
