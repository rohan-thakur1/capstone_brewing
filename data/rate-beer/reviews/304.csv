Perfectly judged and all flavours complement each other whilst being powerful they are never overpowering.

Taste is everything the aroma was plus a little earthy nuttiness, bourbon heavy but not dominant. This was a loooong time whale and was not a let down.""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"

304,"2014-04-16",3.9,"2006 bottle, purchased at the brewery a long time ago when I had the time and money to chase down highly hyped special releases. I have to say, as I work my way through a collection of barrel aged beers, that, generally speaking, I dont think bourbon barrel aging is a good idea. Still, this beer handles it much better than most. Nice amber-brown color with almost no head - do brewers deliberately bottle their barrel aged beers to be flat, or are they just not able to nail the bottle conditioning? The aroma is overwhelmed by bourbon, but some nice caramel malts do make it through. The taste is more interesting than the smell, with a touch of acidity, some pleasant fruitiness/winey flavor and a restrained sweetness, not much hop flavor but enough bitterness to give it some grip. Its smooth and not overly heavy, with a full texture, but, and maybe Im missing the point of a high-gravity, barrel aged barley wine, I would like some bubbles. Alcohol is not prominent at all for a beer this big, and the bourbon does not overpower the taste the way it did the aroma. Its a warm, satisfying, well balanced beer, but personally, I prefer the beer without the barrel aging.","San Diego, California, USA","IEBAILI"

Aroma of hard candies (like the kind on the outside of candy apples), brown sugar, toffee, biscuits, a small bit of vanilla, oak, and some whiskey. Flavor is very similar to the regular version up front: hard candy, toffee, biscuity sweetness. But the finish provides something new: notes of vanilla, oak, and bourbon. The difference from the regular is rather subtle and maybe that's because this has been in the bottle for 2 years or so. Slick and thickish bodied, low carbonation, but not quite syrupy. This is a very good beer, but I must say, I am a bit disappointed at the lack of barrel influence here.

Flavor has significant bourbon, dark sticky toffee, chocolate-covered maraschino cherries, wet oak, and brown sugar.  There is still some hop-tinged flavors here, but the barrel is dominant.

How: Bottle 750ml.  2007 version released in 2009, bottle #88 of 449.  Consumed when a little over than 2 years of age.  Bottle sent to me by kegbear, thanks a million Craig
The look: Cloudy burgundy body topped by a small beige head
In long: Nose is only moderately bourbonny and with plenty of raisins and dark fruits.  This beer smells like a world-class Abt that would have been aged in bourbon barrels for a short period of time.  Just from the aroma I knew it was going to be something special.  Taste has lots of vanilla, raisins, dark fruits, earthy three roots, caramel, notes of milk chocolate, light scented notes similar to garden flowers.  Body is full and the carbonation is very lively and thats totally unexpected from a barrel aged big american beer.  Its hard to put into words why a beer like that works so well, listing a bunch of flavor elements doesnt do it justice and is almost meaningless.  Everything just worked perfectly in this beer.  I went through a full bottle and it was pure pleasure and I would have loved to drink a second bottle immediately, something I almost never say about a barrel aged big beer.  This was one of the greatest big beers Ive ever had, what else can compare?  I went to my PC to google ""greatest big beers"" but I googled ""greatest big boobs"".

304,"2011-04-27",3.8,"Served from a bottle at OTMs 1st Anniversary AleSmith tasting. 2004 vintage. The appearance is a mearky red hued brown. I got the bottle end of the bottle so it had a lot of the yeast in in. The aromas are malty with a oak edge. Caramel would be the most forward but not a sweet caramel. The flavors are similar with a really tasty malt profile, notes of caramel, grainy, brown sugar, not too much other fruit or distinct to me notes. The mouth is full bodied. Smooth, with a bit of chunkiness from the yeast. A really solid brew. Would love to try a touch fresher.","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"
304,"2011-04-20",3.7,"A: The pour is sort of a murky dark amber/copper color with a small khaki head.

S: Moderate amounts of bourbon hit the nose followed by some vanilla and brown sugar.  Plenty of caramel and toffee sweetness to go with it.  No real hop character left at this point.

T: Surprisingly restrained bourbon from an Alesmith barrel aged beer.  Vanilla, brown sugar, toffee, and bread, and yes, some bourbon too.  Perhaps a hint of chocolate, and definitely a bit oxidized.

M: Medium to full in body with a moderate carbonation.

O: Not as overwhelming as some of the other Alesmith barrel aged releases, but quite good, and significantly better than the previous times Ive had it.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

Rusty dark red amber hue with no head.  Flavor is very sweet and medium bitter.  Palate is full bodied and oily soft with a little alcohol burn and just like its base numbskull it is still kind of thin for a barely wine.  Overall a real interesting barley wine.  Fruity and not bitter at all.  Some oxidation but not nearly what there should be at this age.  The bourbon has relaxed a bit and blended very well with the sweet malt backbone.  The hops are mostly gone but the honey notes of the Numbskull are still there.  Overall a very sweet and complex beer that keeps getting better as it warms.

Not terribly bourbon-forward, however.  Also some caramel, sweet bread, and some brown sugar intermingling.  Mouthfeel is medium with low carbonation and a bit of booze in the finish.

Great vanilla bourbon notes, bread, and almond as well. Flavor has more great caramel, sweet oxidation, and dark fruit. Increased presence of sweet nuttiness, like marzipan. Some more orangy, fruity booze presence carries through both the flavor and palate, where the tongue is coated with silky alcohol, almost as if there are ""legs"" in your mouth.

304,"2011-01-17",4.6,"From notes:

2006 vintage. Huge thanks to BigFish for sending this years ago in one of my first trades.

Pours a very dark, murky chestnut brown color with a one finger off white head that quickly fades into a thin ring. Sporadic splotches of lacing left behind.

Slightly earthy, leathery malt aroma with hints of biscuit, caramel and toffee. This is accompanied by an amazing bourbon barrel character. Plenty of earthy oak with a healthy dose of bourbon/booze and a very prominent vanilla character in the nose.

Medium bodied with the perfect balance of earthy, leathery malt, caramel/toffee, alcohol sweetness, bourbon, oak and vanilla. Slight heat but overall the alcohol is excellently masked with subtle warmth in the finish. The malt profile is earthy/leathery yet sweet with hints of caramel, toffee and hazelnut. Theres some slight bitterness that adds balance and an incredible bourbon barrel presence. Earthy oak as well as a huge bourbon and vanilla character. I cant believe that Alesmith was able to create such a delicious bourbon flavor without it tasting like a hot, booze bomb. The ABV is incredibly well masked resulting in a delicious, extremely quaffable beer.

This is the best BA barleywine that Ive had to date and I wish I that I had more bottles.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

304,"2010-06-30",3.7,"Appearance: 06 vintage, bottle 92 of 208, enjoyed side by side with barrel-aged Wee Heavy. Turbid dark amber, semi-clear as it thins. No head, just a thin sheet of bubbles and a hint of carbonation. Not exactly what Id call a good looking beer, but its appropriate for the style.

Smell: Lots of musty barrel aroma upon first smell. After letting it breathe and warm up a bit the complexities start to come out: rich toffee and vanilla, bourbon barrel, iron, dates and a lingering hint of musty barrel. Very complex and interesting, but somewhat boozy, especially once it reaches room temperature.

Taste & mouthfeel: The taste closely mirrors the aroma. Dried fruit, toffee sweetness and boozy bourbon are most prevalent. Rich, but not actually extremely sweet - the oaky tannins do a lot to balance the flavor. The hoppiness of the regular Numbskull has completely subsided, though the barrel-aged version is both more mellow and complex. The mouthfeel is full and coating with little noticeable carbonation. A friend compared the texture to vintage port, and I think thats accurate. Alesmith did a good job minimizing oxidation, as theres barely a trace of it. The finish is long and semi-drying with a slight heat thats both fitting and pleasant.

A great beer overall, and Im very glad I had the chance to try it. Its not something Id reach for often, however.","California, USA","largadeer"

Quite boozy but soft on the palate.  I love regular Numbskull, its probably one of the few I compare all other barleywines to, so Im not surprised that this comes across as a great example of a bourbon aged barleywine.

304,"2009-10-20",4.1,"750mL bottle, 2004 vintage #75/240, courtesy of a very generous BA, poured into a snifter.

Pours a hazy amber brown with a surprisingly big cream-colored head that recedes slowly to a healthy collar and a little lacing.  It shows some legs clinging to the sides after each sip.

The aroma is excellent and well-balanced.  Its got the underlying BW character with the caramel malts, toffee and dark fruits coming out especially.  Its balanced perfectly with the wood and whiskey which brings a bit of vanilla sweetness to the aroma.  What sets it apart for me is the balance as the whiskey is not too overpowering.

The taste is just as good with the bourbon coming out a little more than in the aroma with the big sweet malts forming a solid backbone.  I do think the flavors are a little more watered down than I expected and thats probably just the age.

The mouthfeel is slick with a low carbonation and medium bodied.  Its probably thinned out a little bit over time honestly.

This is an excellent barleywine that was probably world class a year or two ago.  The flavors have mellowed out a bit and its extremely drinkable, but its probably lost a little complexity and body.  Still extremely good.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

I would really like to try another bottle because Im guessing this one isnt the best example of what they can do with this beer based on the other BA Alesmiths Ive had.","Bucks County, Pennsylvania, USA","JB175"

Superbly balanced, a lot more boozy than what the abv would have it.

This was fine, but it just seemed  a little overly boozy and woody and missing the complex caramel and vanilla flavors that the original holds up so well.  Sort of waxy and slightly unpleasant mouthfeel.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

The nose is potent, with the barrel characteristics immediately notable, but it doesnt seem too overwhelming. Initial vanilla flavors seem promising, but like others at the tasting I felt it didnt measure up to the regular version. Mouthfeel was a bit chalky, possibly some oxidation creeping in.

The aroma is forceful and complex, with dates, Madeira, caramel malt, and vanilla.  My first sip of this was almost overwhelming because it was so smooth and well presented.  Flavor has notes of vanilla, bourbon, floral hops, maple butter, and caramel.  This beer is silky smooth with substantial carbonation that balances out the sweet and hoppy flavors.

Pours with a large, creamy, off-white head over a chestnut body (clear on the first, and slightly opaque by the last pour). Legs run above the excellent lace. Head stays for the duration. Aroma is magnificent (""period"")! Brown sugar, bourbon, oak, vanilla, burnt flan, cotton candi, dark fruits, barrel, dates, char, raisins and maple. Very sweet. Taste is hoppy up front with tons upon tons of caramel and toffee with vanilla bourbon notes sneaking through. White oak, very smooth, pine molasses, marzipan, splinters, and a touch of alcohol in the very, very long aftertaste. Syrupy mouthfeel, light tingling bubbles. Warming. Extremely drinkable, but with enough complexity to remind you that this is a big time sipper.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

304,"2009-02-18",4.0,"2006 bottle #45/208. Looks just like the regular version, orange with minimal head. It smells boozy, whiskey, etc. The taste immediately revealed the difference between this and the
regular Old Numbskull, booze. It was as if the barrel-aging was fighting the original character of the beer with vanilla and booze. The beautiful, bitter hoppiness I have tasted in numbskull was defeated by brute strength. This was a nice complex beer but I feel like the barrel-aging obscures some of the best aspects of an already terrific beer.

304,"2009-02-07",3.9,"Bottle # 240/449 (2007). Special thanx to Joey for hooking me up and allowing me the chance to taste this rarity. Aroma is of sweet caramel and maple syrup as well as a faint scent of alcohol. The initial flavor is a tart and almost shock of sourness but then opens up to become a sweet malty blend that is strange compared to the pre barrel-aged version of this beer. In my opinion, this reminds me of a Sam Adams triple bock without the soy sauce flavor. The aging definitely morphed the profile of this beer into chewy and over sweetened malts. And lastly, the appearance is an opaque mahogany with a firm foam head.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"
304,"2009-02-06",4.3,"2007 bottle courtesy Daknole. This one poured a mahogany brown color with a small tan head that slowly fades to a thin film. Small spots of lacing surround the glass. The aroma is so inviting and just keeps coming at you with chocolate, caramel, cherries, and figs. Some oaky vanilla and bourbon undertones round out the nose. The flavor follows with the chocolate, caramel, and dark fruits all soaked into the bourbon with a nice vanilla flavor in the background. Just an amazing flavor that makes you want more and more. Medium-full bodied and very viscous and just smooth texture on the tongue. Subtle carbonations lends well to an all around great beer.

Smooth, moderately sweet entry with some caramel malt, hints of bourbon barrel oak, some vanilla, and a bit of honey that leads into a lightly bitter hoppiness paired with some drying oak and a faint fruitiness.

Notes of caramel, milk chocolate, figs and dates greet a smooth, vanilla laden, sweet bourbon overtone with open arms.  Flavors show notes of nougat, chocolate, caramel, toffee, dark fruits, and vanilla, all of which just soak up the bourbon kissed oak like a sponge.  The term milkshake would not be hyperbole when describing the mouthfeel, which is truly full and viscous, with the texture of liquid suede.

Aroma is an amazing mix of bourbon and malts; sweet vanilla honey, oaky tannins,  nutty, creamy/buttery, ripe pit fruit.  The aroma really reminds me of the 2003 Utopias I enjoyed over the course of the summer.   Flavor isn’t as good as the smell but still pretty good;  harsh oak at first before warming then some of the more subtle flavors begin to come out:  vanilla, fruit, alcohol, nuttiness.

304,"2008-09-03",4.2,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2009 Very very nice Barleywine, and the only one of the BA Alesmiths that I thought was *just* right. This one really is a winner. Everything you expect from Old Numbskull, with the addition of wood, vanilla, and bourbon. The wood and vanilla step up front, and the bourbon takes a backseat, which just adds to this brews complexity. Nice toffee and carmel notes, with some deep dark notes as well. Nice malt backbone and hop profile. This one is outstanding.","Indiana, USA","StFun"

The older version has a minor aroma, but it still has complexity of strong caramel and bourbon overtones.  The newer version has an alcohol aroma added and more brown sugar aromas.  Taste is unbelievable in both versions.  The older version had no carbonation.  That was a bit of a let down in a sense.  The younger version had a nice amount of carbonation.  The older version had a more caramel taste with bourbon and oak that you expect from an alesmith ba.  The younger version has more alcohol taste, more toffee, brown sugar, and is overall a better brew at this point.  Overall I enjoyed both brews.  I wouldn’t let this age more than a few years.  Its good now.  Don’t wait.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"

Fruity and berry-like with tones of cherries, prunes, figs, ripe mango, pineapple, banana and canned cocktail fruits like cherries, pears and peaches.

2002- Pours amber orange with some haze and a off white/pale yellow head. Aroma is stellar, which is full of sugary malts and super fruity. This starts off with a rich and sweet caramel maltiness and transitions to a  spicy bitterness mid palate. Finish is slightly hot and semi-dry with some of the wood coming out. Some peppery notes linger on the palate.  9-3-8-4-16.  2004- Believe it or not, the aroma is a tad less aggressive than the 2002, with a little less fruitiness and more cognac- esque. I found this one a little more boozy than the 02, with some vodka like fusels on the finish. 8-3-7-4-15. 2005- This was similar to the 2004, but I found this to have more butterscotch notes and a slightly thinner finish. 7-3-7-4-16.  2006- Aroma is similar to the 2002, but with less fruity esters and more brown sugar. This had the most residual sweetness of the vertical, however I found this to be a little green as well. Boozy like the 04. I think this one needs more time in the bottle to let the flavors meld and complexities come out. My least favorite of the vertical. 7-3-6-3-14. 

There was a regular Old Numbskull that went unopened at the tasting. Perhaps we should have thrown that into the mix. I am posting the rating of the 2002, since that was my favorite.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"

Appearance: Pours a clearish, deep copper-hued body thats completely still.

Smell: Heavy bourbon scent thats a real treat to get a snootful. Gobs of vanilla and caramel eliciting memories of caramel-coated vanilla cheesecake or maybe a good crusty creme brulee. Plus, some crushed up citrus-flavored cookies.

Taste: Luscious, sweet-tasting vanilla bean and caramel. Taste of oven-baked sugar cookies. Toasty wood character. Drop of orange oil. Hint of dried dark fruitiness. Slightly oxidized malts. Freshly shaved coconut. Sweet, warming finish.

This had me doing cartwheels. Coconut, chocolate, candy, thick sweet tarry malt and some very slight soy but its not putting me off any. Such incredible boozy barrelly notes that are surprisingly not overdone at all and just perfectly poised. Caramel, lovely sweetcorn, obvious brandy overtakes the bourbon easily. Damn, it really is all over the shop. Harmonious and seriously good. Very nutty in the mouth. Possibly a little too much alcohol showing with plenty of burn but it is one of those beers where it is enjoyable rather than being a problem. Caramel and chocolate echo the aroma really well. Not quite so good in the mouth as on the nose but still a challenging and complex brew. Its like drinking coconut butter and I loved every minute. Thick and tangy mouthfeel with such an amazing zip round the sides of the palate and a harsh but immensely satisfying sting right at the edges. A rare and very special treat.A measure of what a bloody marvelous guy Brad is. I did a bit of a trade with him at Zythos and in the weeks running up to the festival I pestered him constantly to try and get him to trade me this bottle. Eventually he comes back to me to say sorry but he just cant bring himself to part with it. Quite understandably. Then what does he do?

Pour was a murky sewer water dark brown with no head or movement. Taste was very tasty and sweet. Sticky dark malt and plum with raisin in the front. Strong hop bite with alcohol burn in the back. Not as oily as some barley wines and enough carbonation to keep me happy. Nicely done!","Moon Twp, suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","LinusStick"
304,"2008-01-26",3.6,"Thanks to Tyler for sharing this one.  It is good enough, but not as complicated as I expected.  The bourbon is mild, perhaps from aging, and that is the way I like it.

The flavor followed suit, some vanilla and raisiney notes, hops still making their presence known, though, piney/resinous aspects. Mouthfeel was amply carbonated considering the age, balancing anything sticky about this, as well as the slight bitter/hop presence.

Almonds, hazelnuts, toffeecake, and plenty of barrel in a fairly rough hewn and raw aroma; vanilla, quiet heat and a touch of vinegar.  Searing vanilla beans, pineapple, and tangy fruit juice in the massive and unforgiving bourbon flavor; the depth of malt here is thoroughly indecipherable under the pressure of so much grating sweetness.  Oily, but not especially heavy in the mouth; seems slightly thinned in a sense separate from the flat, milky texture.

Thanks to hezron for sharing this.  I can now understand why this is one of his favorite beers.  If only this was readily available Id buy another bottle in a heart beat.  As it is I was glad to have given it a try.  If this ever comes out again I will be doing everything I can to get another crack at it.
Aroma / Appearance - The half finger head was the color of old eggshells.  The copper body let the light trickle through slowly.  Oak and vanilla imparted from the barrel aging complemented the dark malts, chocolate an caramel well.  Old hops, as one would expect from a five year old beer, play against a fruity sweetness.  If I had to sum up the last part it reminds me of ice cream sprinkled with caramel sauce.
Flavor / Palate - Caramel, cherry pie filling and orange peel immediately hit the senses upon the first sip.  A strong bourbony presence is still obvious but not overwhelming.  Oak and custard play against the warmness left by a slight booziness.  The mouthfeel is as close to perfect as it gets - it does not stick in the mouth nor go immediately down the throat.  For reasons beyond rarity this is certainly a sipping beer that improves as it warms.  The finish of caramel and cherry licorice leaves one wanting more.  It was a sad realization when the bottle was empty.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Finishes equally mellow with citrus/berry, some residual hop flavor, raisins, rum, and not much bitterness at all.  Med/heavy body and perfectly low carbonation, but the flavor was too mellow for me.  Somehow it just didnt register in all parts of the mouth like a beer usually would.

Some vanilla and toffee as well, maybe some faint hops.  Citrusy.  Quite a bit of bourbon in the flavor, still a good deal of alcohol but not a bad amount- quite typical for Numbskull in general.  I get more toffee here than caramel, along with some fruityness.  Not at all bitter.  Very full and coating mouth feel, and as would be expected, low carbonation.

304,"2007-04-07",4.2,"25 oz bottle, via WeeHeavySD, 2004 vintage.  Pours a clear orangish copper under a creamy and slightly foamy one finger beige head.  Lots of heavy lacing left as it receded to a thin covering.  The nose is just wonderful.  The perfect amount of bourbon with a light oak and vanilla accent to the base beer.  The caramel and toffee of the regular version is still there, with a touch of alcohol and some light yeast.  The flavor is a little heavier than I expected with the bourbon, especially after the nose, and maybe a little too heavy.  Alot of bourbon and oak up front, covering up much of the caramel and toffee that I love about Old Numbskull.  Finishes with lots of oak tannins and a big alcohol burn that made my gumline tingle.  The warmer it got the more the toffee came out on the finish, but much less than the regular version.  Mouthfeel is very full bodied but doesnt seem as sticky and thick as the regular version.  Still quite mouthcoating on the finish even though the alcohol seems to thin it out some.  Moderate fizzy carbonation also keeps the stickiness in check.  Pretty good all around, but I think its maybe a little too heavy on the bourbon.  Given the choice between this and the regular version Id lean towards the regular because of its much higher drinkability.  In and of itself this is pretty damn great, however I cant help but rate it in comparison to the regular version.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Pleasant musky oak-pine flavour accompanied by thick, raisiny dark fruits. A bit sugary at moments but never syrupy or cloying. It’s also quite warming, which is to be expected, but I actually found it to be hot more often than not. The hop profile was quite interesting though considering it’s age, still plenty of citrus and pineyness. Solid.

Pineapple, apple, some juniper and plenty of spice. This aroma is near perfect and certainly worthy of a ten, so exciting. Reminds me of being in a big closet. Flavor is a real stunner as well. Vanilla and wood are towering, embracing. Caramel malt is of a perfect consistency and quantity. Touches of cocoa and marshmallow sneak in and out. Hops are shy but still noticeable, near the original dosing. A backnote of cinnamon and paprika round out this superbly flavored beer. Finishes spicy. Semi-dry with great bitterness brings me quickly back for more. Palate is thick, alcohol very warming. Big power and expression here, well done Alesmith.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Aromas of dark spice and musk mix in.  Thick syrupy palate.  The taste begins with a hop stab, but theres a bourbon character throughout thats not overwhelming.  Dark pit fruit and raisin in there as well.  An excellent brew.  Dark, musky, I felt like I should have been wearing a smoking jacket while drinking this.","Florida, USA","JMFG"

Boozy fruit nose, oranges, vanilla, plus all the othee ON scents.

Excellent.","Virginia Beach, USA","Immy"

Pours a clear, oily, reddish-amber appearance; minimal head formation, leaving a trail of off-white bubbles at the perimeter.  Generous, sweet-bourbon nose: very boozy, with hints of raisins and brown sugar, along with a minimal sour-mash tartness.  Layer upon layer of flavor: bourbon, hints of wood and oak, maple syrup and vanilla; like the most gentle, warming bourbon one could hope for.  Its almost hard to recognize the regular Old Numbskull underneath this, but i hardly miss it here.

304,"2006-11-30",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 15, 2007 Thanks to Naven for the bottle!  Very appreciated.  Now on to this beer.  Been meaning to put my rating in for this for quite some time now.  This beer smelled great with awesome fruits, oak, caramel malts, and BIG bourbon.  The appearance got pretty bad marks for the muddled rusty color with not much head to speak of what so ever.  Even being aged for 2 years didnt seem to do a whole lot for subduing the immense amount of booziness and alcohol in the flavors.  It was good, but for two years aged it was still so prominent that any thing else was hardly noticeable or masked by the alcohol.  A good beer, and great rare treat to have, and I am glad to of tried it...Thanks Naven! 


Rerate:  I shared this a while ago with Black95tt, MikeMcallister, and the Owner of Vintage Estates, Ron.  Still really got a lot of bourbon in the nose, but other things were alittle more noticeable and complex this time.  The flavors really seem to meld with the barrel aging a lot better the second time around on this beer.  Lots of sweet and smooth caramel malts, a little bit of bourbon, some toasted wood and oak, and several other subtleties.  Very enjoyable brew!  My rerate would bump up the palate a point from 3 to 4, and the flavors from a 7 to a 9.","Green, Ohio, USA","LeopoldStoch"
304,"2006-11-26",3.8,"From a 750mL Bottle.  Pours a relatively still, murky honey red color with a small trace of bubbly off-white head.  Lots of bourbon in the nose, bringing out shades of vanilla, caramel, and loads of oak.  Some light green raisins and bourbony pineapple provide a nice light fruity base.  Very woody and bourbon forward bouquet.  Medium bodied, relatively still mouthfeel.  Caramelly malts and some white vinous notes blend nicely with vanilla and oak. A second wave of flavor brings out some bitter hop notes, more dry oakiness and a touch of bourbony heat.  Not bad, but Im actually finding myself to prefer the richer fruit and hop characters of the standard Old Numbskull over the barrel aged version, which has more of a hot, oaky bias.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
304,"2006-11-26",3.9,"Rich bourbon cream aroma, resplendent with cherries, raisins, hints of milky chocolate and dark brown rum cooked with bananas. Ruby pour, with orange-yellow fringes. Hardly any head. Flavor is along the lines of the arom, with rich, creamy and almost oily sugar tannins, lots of tawny, pear, raisins and sweet cream vanilla, intended for oaky sugars. Quite light on the carbonation, which is a bummer. Theres a sweet tinge of euro-like hops along the backedge, but it makes the old hop presentation moan, as this is more subdued and to my liking. I enjoyed the light oxidization character of this beer, as truer to the plummy, raisin-like sweetness characters of the style, but without carbonation and some warmth noticeable from the barrel, I dont find this a phenomenal improvement over the straight version. However, I certainly do not believe this to be a top 50 beer.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

You see that picture of the bottle numbered #69/225 over there to the left of my rating? Thats that bottle that Enniskillen gave me about 2 years ago, and the one Im dinking right now! 

The beer pours a foggy dim amber body and a creamy ivory head. The aroma belches out the vinous implications of oak aging. Tons of lightly sour cherries, a tart hint of buttermilk, pulverized vanilla bean, candied sugars, and an immense fruitiness. 
The flavor is very fruity Loads of pear, red apple, plum, date, fig, prune, and cherry This is a freaking Holiday fruitcake dipped in bourbon! Ill tell ya Im grabbing a little buzz here as I finish this bottle up!

The aroma is vanilla, oak, bourbon with some sweet caramel malts barely coming through. Almost no hops in the nose. The palate is medium with subtle carbonation. Bourbon is heavy on the tongue when first sipping. In fact its almost overpowering at first, right up to the point you begin to swallow, ahhhh, there is the barleywine I remember.

The flavor is sweet and intense.  Its mellowed nicely in the barrel and is smooth instead of overly hot as many barley wines can be.  Theres very little carbonation on the palate and not much hops coming through.  The sweetness masks the 10% ABV and the warmth in the throat at the end is the only cue to its strength.

Aromas of oak, vanilla, some faint citrus orange that has been pulled from the original with age.   There is also a little faint caramel in the aroma as well.  Flavor is just plain beautiful.  Caramel, and toffee notes begin and are accented by some faint orange citrus flavors, nice oak, smooth vanilla, some raisins.  So complex it is tough to describe all of the flavor.. This is the smoothest barleywine that I have ever set my lips on..  The barrel takes all of the rugged hops from the original and replaces them with those vanilla and oak flavors that smooth the edges and make this so perfect to drink..

Highly complex aroma, richness, and bitterness with added bourbon and wood character from the barrel, along with vanilla, caramel, subtle red fruits, and style-appropriate oxidation.  The level of complexity here is beyond comparison.  Its like various layers of the beer are decomposing to form new flavors and aromas while at the same time revealing still more levels waiting beneath.

Nose is of oak and butterscotch.  Barleywine forwardness is mellowed and softened, nicely rounded by the aging its gone through.  Caramel and tawny notes, a beer you could slosh in your mouth for minutes before swallowing.

304,"2005-10-30",2.8,"2004 Vintage bottle, # 202/240, Sampled October 2005
It is with much anticipation that I open this baby up.  I really could not believe the news that I would be able to purchase this beer at my local bottle shop here in Tucson, AZ (thanks again LittleGuy).  It pours a deep amber color that when held up to the light shows a mostly brilliantly clear cherry red color.  The head is a frothy, creamy, rocky mix of textures and is a light amber to tan color.  As I pour this beer I get a big caramel maltiness coupled with a shot of Bourbon aromatics.  The oak is strongly evident in the nose; at first comes a tannic woody note that moves to notes of vanillin and finishes off with a strong note of buttery oak.  Underneath the wood character there is a hint of the former hop monster that this beer was: I get hints of floral pine, and remembrances of grapefruit long suppressed.  

The beer has no apparent sweetness to it (at least what could be there is drowned out by the other flavors).  The mouthfeel on this one is incredibly rich and smooth up front, creamy would be an apt description for this beer to be sure.  The taste actually has a bit of sourness to it, really just makes this beer slightly tart up front.  The tartness coupled with fruitiness, reminds me of tart plums and apples.  All of these are just peripheral flavors though; this beer is absolutely dominated by the oak character.  Throughout is a buttery oak note that is joined by notes of vanillin as well as a tannic woody astringency that reminds me black tea.  The finish is still quite hoppy though with a solid bitterness that tries to peak through the oak, but ultimately succumbs to the buttery oak notes which linger long after the beer has left my mouth.  Hints of this beers former glory surface from time to time; at times I get a faint trace of a sharp hop flavor that is a mix of citrus and herbs, but then it vanishes just as quickly as it was noticed.  At other times I get wisps of malt character (like notes of sweet caramel and rich toffee), but they too get quickly trampled by the Bourbon Barrel.

This beer has mostly become a vehicle for the barrel flavors, what flavors that do peak through from the Old Numbskull play a supporting role to mitigate / round-out the oak flavors.  I bet you a mixture of half fresh Numbskull and half this beer would be quite tasty, there would still be a big hop and malt presence to balance out the barrel contribution.  As this beer stands it does not have enough balance nor complexity to be great.  I have never been a fan of barrel aged beers for barrel aged beers sake; I really prefer a bold beer flavor with the supporting role being played by the barrel character.  In this case the barrel character plays the lead role, and somewhere down there in the supporting cast there is an aged version of Old Numbskull.

Shared with Eyedrinkale on 8/5/2005.Pours a thick, opaque, dark, dark brownish-black body, with a huge head formation, that is not that long-lasting, though there are bits of lacing down the glass.  Smells of rich, green, bitter, mega-hoppiness, thick, salty, bitter roast and dark chocolate.  Rich, heavy caramel sweetness.  The flavor, personified, is like a thick, hot, humid night with heavy, stifling air and no moonlight.  Good lord, this is one of the most powerful, richest, just all out massive beers Ive ever had.  Huge hops bitterness (and a weird dill-like note), salty, thick, rich black malts, massive caramel and bitter bakers chocolate.  The body is awesome, even at 3 years of age, it still shows no signs of aging, while the carbonation is low, with a creamy and sticky consistency (which really saves the palate score, as this stuff demonstrates no balance).  Alcohol is hidden as in regular Old Numbskull (seems to be variability on alcohol apparency looking at other ratings).  The barrel aging is not overdone, which is another impressive aspect.  Just enough to add some character without dominating the beer (though in actuality, it would take a lot to dominate this monster).What do I think???  I hate it and cant even drink my half of the bottle, but then, its no surprise, as this aint my thing.  Do I think its all hype?? No, not really hype as much as peoples preference for big, rich, hoppy beers.  And thats cool, this is a barleywine after all, as EDA says.

Big thanks to JohnC for this one!
Id love to do the BA version side by side with the regular, both are excellent Barleywines in any case.
Deep amber color with a small head typical of Barleywines.
Rich caramel aroma with a resiny hop note to it.
The alcohol comes through lightly in the flavor but is dominated by a rich smooth caramel and dark dried fruit blend of flavors. Very creamy and smooth palate.  Probably my favorite of the American Style Barleywines.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"

Dark ambery orangy color.  Lots of sweet malt aromas, with vanilla and oak.  Flavor was very well balanced.  Sweet caramelly maltiness and some nice fruit like maybe prunes.  Lots of vanilla and oak in the flavor too, but not anywhere close to overpowering.  This is one of the most in-balance oak-aged beers Ive had.  Very very impressive.","Norcross, Georgia, USA","beeryum"

Aroma was surprisingly hoppy for having this age, nice meld of earthiness and faint citrus, and decidedly alcohol driven.  Flavors were immense, complex, and balanced.  Earthy hops, toffee, caramel, and faint vanilla, some raisin and cherry fruit as well.  Bourbon was very faint, and completely integrated into the beer.  This is the way barrell aging should be done.  Fantastic.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

304,"2005-06-20",4.6,"UPDATED: SEP 21, 2008 Big thanks to whom ever was generous enough to break this out that the ‘Nooga fest.  I had stepped out for a moment and almost missed this exquisite treat.  Fortunately my wife snagged a taste for me (she’s the best!).  Bottle #26/225 (2002).  Looked a hazy amber color in my glass.  The aroma was caramel with toffee.  Sweet and inviting.  The flavor explodes with toffee, dark fruit, chocolate/coffee, and the bourbon barrel is barely noticable.  Very creamy texture anbd warm.  An absolute taste sensation.  It saddens me to know that I will likely never get my own bottle of this. 
Beer Cellar brought a 4-year vertical to Noog 4!  Could not even believe it.  2002, 2004, 2005, 2006.  General notes were that 2002 & 2004 were much lighter in color than the later years.  2002 & 2004 had enough years on them that they stole the show, with 2002 showing much fuller integraion of all flavors with caramel being the central flavor profile.  2004 was also well integrated but having a touch a chocolate not found in the 2002.  2005 was one of Jen’s favorite but I thought 2005 & 2006 needed more time int the bottle to get the ultra smooth flavors found in the oder bottles.  2006 was still very boozy and the wood was almost overpowering.  No change in score.  This stuff is awesome!","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"
304,"2005-06-19",4.4,"A reddish orange appearance with a minimal head. A whiskey and cherry aroma. This one is a little bit on the sweet side with some oak notes.

Reminds me specifically of a whisky Ive had before but I cant remember which (maybe I should rate them, no?  *snort*)  Heavily sweet, lightly acidic flavor becomes a moderately sweet, lightly acidic finish with moderate alcohol (warming, not hot).  Medium-full body, oily texture, soft carbonation.  The bottom line is: not quite as smokey as I would like and a little much alcohol even though its not a bad taste.  Still, damn good.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Opaquish medium amber in color with a persistant off-white head and fair lacing.  Pleasant woody and bourbon aroma which doesnt overpower the fruity and floral notes of the malt.  A bit of oxidation in the nose but it seems to blend in nicely.  Residual sugars are still present, a nice woody and slightly tannic profile does this BW justice.  Medium to full bodied, slightly drying.  A bit boozy.  Damn nice example of a barrel aged beer.","Alabama, USA","11026"

The aroma of this brew is complex and delicious, very fruity, plentiful malts, with scents of over-ripe apricot, orange and fig, along with pronounced oaky notes, hints of bourbon and an assertive turpentine and pine hop scent.  The alcohol becomes much more pronounced in the aroma as it warms becoming a predominant feature at room temp.  The flavor is rich and sweet with a huge fruity maltiness, more oak and bourbon, alcohol and the hops occuring as aged and candied grapefruit rind.  Mouthfeel is full and almost syrupy with a gently creamy carbonation.  Ive been saving this one for a while and its indeed, quite a treat!","San Diego, California, USA","SDbruboy"
304,"2005-06-11",4.3,"Bottle #92 provided to me by Joe and shared with Kuhnhenn shindig ratebeerians: Murky orange hue with a lasting small fizzy head and some lace. The aroma has salty and peaty notes, light oak, piney and spicy hops, clove, and wonderful oxidition and old ale esters. The taste starts with a big WOW of spicy and bitter characters supported by a moderate sugary and subdued oaky note.  A touch fruity, but more akin to orange zest than grapefruit. The finish has a bite of bitters, salt, and alcohol snap. The feel is oily and lush with enough power that you know its a Numbskull at heart. Worthy of its place among the panthon of world-class beers. Glad to have shared this, sadly it will not be with the RBSG gathering.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

Pours a cloudy amber with a small off-white head.  Lots of caramel up front.  Banana bread seems to be covered up by the bourbon and woodiness.  Hops are also rather subdued due to the barrel aging.  Not as present as the aroma suggests.  Bourbon is the strongest in the finish.  Flavor seems to show more signs of age than Id expected from a barley wine brewed two years ago.  Very nice.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"

Pours dark reddish/orange with no discernible head. The aroma is all barrel aged; bourbon, vanilla, lots of oak. The flavor is initially brown sugar, honey, and semi-sweet malt. The mid-taste is barrel-aged flavors and it is somewhat hot with some dark sugar tastes, but mostly barrel aging. I have only liked a few barrel aged beers, I find that the barrel aging takes over the flavor instead of complimenting it, this was no exception. Still a good beer, but I would probably rather have the non-BA version.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

304,"2005-06-01",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2005 I was pleasantly surprised when csbosox pulled out bottle 179 of 225. We agreed that the barrel aging was the dominant characteristic. The body poured a dark amber with a little bit of cloudiness. The aroma was the typical bourbon barrel aging with vanilla and oak. There was also roasted peanuts and a little citrus, but they were dominated by the barrel aging. I also detected a hint of cinnamon. The taste was sweet oranges with vanilla and a little salt. There is a coppery chocolate finish. The body is very thick and coats the mouth. This is slightly lactic. The entire package was underwhelming and comes together in a strange way. I tried this again, courtesy of MrFacto. I stand by my previous rating.","Urbandale, Iowa, USA","heemer77"

Aroma is quite woody, musty, decadent.  Theres certainly an AleSmith house character, Im starting to realize.  Velvet body is soft, smooth, and so so long on the palate.  Gorgeous.  Despite its age, this beer is still damned hot.  Lots of alcohol presence even though its not all that high of an ABV (10%); the alcohol does seem to be integral to the role that the wood has brought to the scene.  The extra smoothness of sweet cream and honey-butter that oak have brought to the table are kept in check by the peppery, numbing heat of the resurgent alcohol.  Flavors are full of brown sugar, some candied fig, light leafy bitterness.  I get something earthy, too, sort of detritus-ish, but that might be my imagination.  If nothing else, this beer deserves some bonus points just for being so interesting.  Thanks a million for sharing this one, Joe!","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

304,"2005-04-15",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 13, 2012 2004 version, shared with Larry Pitonka.  The nose seems very young, with semi-hot bourbon and some other sweet caramel and orange notes, but hidden well beneath the bourbon.  The texture is extremely smooth, echoing the comments of others about this beer.  Im really amazed at how they pulled this out so well.  Has an incredible finish, very long lasting with a smooth and sweet bourbon and butterscotch flavor, spicy and peppy on the tongue.  Just really magnificant.


2005 version, shared by kmweaver. Pours a muddy, ugly tawny brown color, with nearly no head whatsoever, no matter how vigorous you swirl.  Nose of detached, slightly oxidized cardboard, bourbon, wood and sticky old-ale-ish base malts.  Texture is bright, loose, and disjionted, nothing like the smoothness, richness and silkiness of the 2004.

Malty flavors with toffee, bourbon and plenty of alcohol.  The flavors are well balanced with the bourbon aspect but the alcohol stands out.

Whereas Numbskull has some absolutely lovely refined vanilla and hazelnut notes couched in a hop-monster frame--which would presumably benefit from some conventional cellaring--this barrel aged version evinces an extremely oaky profile, which runs roughshod over an otherwise fine brew.

304,"2005-03-05",4.5,"Bottle #61 of 225. Dark maroon color. Small sized white foamy head. Aroma is bready molasses sweet with a touch of oak and earth. A full-bodied barley wine. Malts are fruity (cherries, plums and raisins), brown sugar and bready. Hops are grapefruity and slightly piney. VERY smooth taste. You can notice the bourbon barrel flavors (and they are prevalent), but the aging seems to be most noticeable in the smoothness of this beer.  This is one mother of a smooth beer. Ever more complex than the non-barrel aged version. It has all the added complexities of the wood, oak bourbon stuff as well. Glad I have a few more that I can age a bit. Definitely a sipping beer.

Fresh aroma, surprisingly, sweet, moderated alcohol, a bit of chocolate, and a lot of things that I found harder to place than when I tasted it.  Hazy/opaque caramel brown.  First note of flavor is substantially of the bourbon, with prominent chocolate and licorice notes for me, plus some more subtle vanilla.  It flows nicely around the mouth, though not exceptionally richly.  There are a lot of qualities that remind me of a vintage English ale--and just as I was writing this, Tad mentioned the same thing out loud.

Nose barrel-esque, but doesnt overpower the beer, still get nice toffee, maple, and vanilla notes.  Same with the flavor, what we have here is a barrel-aged beer that actually tastes like a beer with some barrel character rather than like a beer thats had a shot of crappy bourbon dropped in it.  The toffee/butterscotch melds beautifully with the oak, still has hops, and the barrel character hangs around nicely.  This is how barrel aging should work.  It adds character to this beer rather than kills off the flavor of the original.  Nice stuff.","Eagan, Minnesota, USA","MilkmanDan"
304,"2005-02-07",4.4,"Bottle at jeffc666s Birthday Gathering. Courtesy of a trade with Enniskillen. Number 30 of 225. Clouded copper. Small tan head. Aroma is very oaky and laden with alcohol notes, hops, vanilla, and caramel. Light malty notes. Taste is hoppy but has a pleasant woody/oaky flavor, light smoked notes,alcohol, light sweet malts, caramel, fruit and vanilla. Some citrus notes hiding in there as well. Body is moderate with some alcohol warmth and semi-smoothness.  Finish is more oak with vanilla, alcohol notes, citrus, creamy malts, and fruit. Great beer!","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"

304,"2005-02-07",4.1,"Pours lightly hazy amber. Aroma is a blend of caramel, wood, and hops. Flavor is woody, caramel, with marshmellow. Excellent. Had this side by side with the original old numbskull, and this one stands heads and shoulders above it.","Silver Spring, Maryland, USA","jeffin7"
304,"2005-02-07",4.5,"Sampled at jeffc666s gathering, brought by The_Beer_God. Clear amber with an off white head. I dug the aroma on this; caramel with sherry and wood/oak. Taste also has notes of caramel and oak plus some pipe tobacco, toasty malt, some light brown sugar, toffee, cherry and pineapple. Very full, round and smooth on the palate. Overall, just awesome. Did a side by side vs. regular Old Numbskull and this one had more to offer.","Ashburn, Virginia, USA","jasonp"
304,"2005-02-06",4.0,"Bottle sampled at jeffc666s B-day gathering 2/6/05:  Thanks to The_Beer_God again for this one.  Hazy amber color, no head, small particles visable in my glass.  It was fun to drink this side by side with the regular old numbskull.  Overall I didnt like the barrel aged version  any better, though it was different.  The aroma has lots of wood, oak, toasted wood, alcohol, pear, apple, vanilla.  Flavor is salty, with pronounced wood notes, alcohol, port, cherries, sweet syrupy malts, apple, honey, and finishes with a mild nasal alcohol burn.  Quite dry and somewhat thin.  Very good, but definitely has a bit inflated rating.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"
304,"2005-02-06",4.0,"(Bottle #30 thanks for sharing Mike, The_Beer_God) Clear ruby body with a small tan head. The aroma is loade with oak, light alcohol, caramel, toffee, faint vanilla, and cream sherry. The flavor is toasty oak, sweet toffee and caramel, light bitterness and alcohol. Dry thinnish mouthfeel. Slighlty better than the regular ON, but not one of my favorite barleywines.","Fairfax, Virginia, USA","jeffc666"
304,"2005-02-06",4.3,"(Bottle 30, shared courtesy of The_Beer_God)  Cloudy copper body, off-white head.  Aroma is moderately sweet, vanilla/bourbon, oak, toffee.  Taste is moderately sweet, toffee, oak, fairly light bourbon.  Moderately full body.  The bourbon barrel definitely works well with the Old Numbskull, and a side-by-side leaves me feeling BAON is better than ON.  Somehow the taste shows more of the wood cask than the bourbon, definitely a positive.  I will enjoy opening other bottles of this later.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
304,"2005-01-30",2.5,"Bottle 212. Virtually no head. Body is hazy medium amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (caramel/molasses), trace hops (resin), with a strong note of sherry, notes of alcohol and cask wood. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly acidic. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly acidic, lightly bitter. Medium body, watery texture, soft carbonation, moderately alcoholic.  One of the bigger disappointments in the top 50 Ive experienced, but of course I usually hate oxidation and this is swimming with it.  Oddly, fresh off-the-shelf versions of the non-barreled Numbskull and some other Alesmith brews (Wee Heavy, Anvil) have also been quite oxidized and dull, so it seems to be becoming a brewery trait.  But apart from the oxidation, this was watery, rather thin and bland, and there just isnt much going on in the aroma.  It was a drain pour for me, to be perfectly honest.  Tastes like hype, with all due respect to the brewery.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
304,"2005-01-30",3.3,"UPDATED: FEB 15, 2005 Bottle # 212.  Very aromatic and the wood influence is unmistakable showing hints of oak, vanilla and bourbon along with the malt, which shows a bit of caramel and burnt toffee.  The excessive aromatic hops in the regular Old Numbskull has tamed to an almost undetectable level.  In the flavor, the hops have again tamed and the wood is clearly evident.  Notes of bourbon, oak, caramel and toffee with a touch of vanilla.  The body and texture is lacking.  This should have been aged in a wine barrel.  A bourbon barrel was not the proper vessel for this beer.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
304,"2005-01-30",4.1,"Pours with basically no head, a reddish, cloudy, rusty color. Big rich, sweet and bourbon aroma. Taste is a big bourbon and alcohol punch. Very smooth palate. Hoppy, but could use more hops. The alcohol is not at all hidden, and I think this takes away from the beer. Malt presence is there, but could come through a lot more. Still pretty good.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"
304,"2005-01-20",4.4,"Aroma is one of vanilla and bourbon both of which came out in the flavor along with some plum. Nice malt tone to it. Pleasant dry finish. Wonderful Beer.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PWalk"
304,"2005-01-18",4.2,"Light maroon and hazy with a fine bubbly light beige head that forms a thin film and a ring of fine bubbles.  Creamy bourbon aroma with raisin and banana...lots of bourbon with butterscotch notes.  Salty hops up front quickly giving way to a smooth, caramely, bourbon that compliments a sweet raisin-spicy malt.  The barrel aging really pacified the hops bitterness, working it in perfectly with the other flavours.  Way smoother than the non-barrel aged Old Numbskull.  Full body and light to medium carbonation.  A little warming from the alcohol.  Awesome.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

OK, heres a case where the barrel really does make a difference.  The regular ON is far too thin, overly bitter without supporting body...this has more head, seems thicker and deeper in the body just to look at, a good sign...oaky vanilla and whiskey dominate the nose, hops subdued...maltier and much fruitier (think fresh and dried plums, raisins, spiced apples), some lovely bourbon-vanilla, some heavy bitterness at the finish but this time there is enough sweetness and depth to support it.  World class?  Dunno, but its ok by me.  Thanks Alex for this rare treat!","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

304,"2005-01-17",4.5,"The Lure:A shining bourbon barrel gracefully rises from the earthy, muddy soil in which it had been maturing to reveal a bounty filled with candied fruit of all sorts, sprinkled with cocoa powder confetti.

The Festivities:This Holy Grail emerges from its slumber more patient, less hoppy and a more cohesive proponent of lifes ripeness. Liquorous candy bourbon politely yet amorously envelops the plethora of throbbing fruit as a yeastier and earthier ending canonizes that inspiring communion above.

304,"2005-01-17",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 23, 2009 Plums, raisins and tropical fruitiness hides beneath strong oak and bourbon aromas with heavy dark malts.  Opaque medium brown/tan with decent off-white head that recedes to thin cover and ring.  Sweet, nutty flavour has a strong alcoholic note to it.  Whisky and oak flavours are obvious and enjoyable.  Plenty of orange-citrus fruitiness and some pine-like hop spiciness.  Strong alcohol warming, soft palate and low carbonation.  Very enjoyable!  Bottle #38/225 enjoyed with asheft, beerbuzzmontreal, MartinT, muzzlehatch, Rastacouere and Yowie.  Thanks, Alex!  Resampled bottle 128/225 at the Fullers vertical tasting in early 2009 and found that it had gone downhill in a big way.  Alcohol and whisky were overwhelming and body had thinned considerably as carbonation had become very strong, prickly and short-lived.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
304,"2005-01-16",3.7,"UPDATED: JUL 26, 2005 Rubyish orange to medium brown, hazy. Good color really. A light off-white cover tops it all. Big peppermint bourbon aroma. The regular numbskull’s fruit salad (integrated melon, pineapple, cherry, banana, mango etc.) aroma is there, soaked in alcohol gently. Elegant woody riped fruits counter adequately the pencil shavings dryness emanating from those luckily subdued hops. I doubt I would enjoy the blend if hops were as straightforward as in the regular numbskull. Soft liquid caramel, subtle and smooth palate requires lips licking swiftly though it’s not cloying in a bad way. Very low carbonation contributes to the smooth feel. Full bodied, minty, earthy finish. Satisfying sipper from skilled craft brewers. Bourbon is the focus though, but the silky palate carries it well enough that it’s worth seeking even if you’re getting tired of those and I admire the retraint of those hops showing just a slight piney gap.  I don’t know if age would really help that one. It’s pretty well integrated as is, its alcohol components are warming and fitting the sipper state. I just don’t feel it’s a top 20 beer, nevermind THE best. I’m glad to see I enjoyed it as much as the regular though. The bourbon aging has worked very similarly with this than with speedway, but it feels globally oxidized... Thanks to asheft for sharing!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

Head is a thin grey-tan with only a light whisp lingering.  Great dark vanilla bean and bourbony aroma.  Big rich bourbon and light hop flavors with some subdued caramel and alcohol.  Gets much better as it warms, but Id say it needs a lot of time still.  Very nice hints of both vanilla extract and vanilla bean as well as some faint unsweetened chocolate.  Awesome dry finish but not enough melding of the alcohol with the bourbon subtlety and the vanilla.  Very good, but give her another 2 years and shell be awesome.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

Silky smooth mouthfeel, and I mean SMOOTH!..Rich, complex flavors showing notes of vanilla, licorice, bourbon, dried pineapple and apricot, chocolate, toasted marshmellow, and still evident hop bitterness.  The Barrel aging doesnt overwhelm you with bourbon notes, yet it smooths and mellows the beer significantly and adds vanilla and chocolate flavors to the beer that I dont remember being there before.
