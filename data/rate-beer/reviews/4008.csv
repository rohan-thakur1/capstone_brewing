4008,"2016-05-01",3.8,"Pours jet black. Aroma of funky brett, coffee and fresh hops. Flavour is not exactly spot on for a black IPA. It's more of a stout than an IPA that's for sure.

4008,"2016-03-12",4.2,"All the rage downunder are the black IPAs. This does not disappoint. Enough malt to balance out the aggressive fresh hoppiness. Not sweet or overly cloying. Very nice beer that will have you grabbing a second one to make sure.","AUSTRALIA","Scotchy"
4008,"2015-08-07",3.7,"Draught at Mikkeller Bangkok. Dark brown pour with a creamy biege head. The aroma has nice grapefruit and pine hop accents along with chocolate and roasted malt. The flavour is smooth roasted malts, light coffee, chocolate, and citrusy pine hops (orange and grapefruit). The dominant hop impression is of pine. I was hoping for a dark malts version of Hopwired, which it isnt. Its a lovely beer though.","Tasmania, ","wvhoran"
4008,"2015-05-29",4.4,"On tap @ Csakajósör - Clear, very dark brown colour with a massive creamy beige head. Nice tropical fruit and citrussy aromas by supposedly New Zealand hops.

4008,"2014-11-23",4.4,"Tap at Le Senk. Aroma fruity, resiny, cascadian. Light roasted. Clear very dark colour. Rather stable head. Taste is very hopforward, I instinctively licked my lip in search of a stray hop leaf in my mouth initially. Brutal flavour kick, bitterness is high, but palatable. Alcohol content is higher, but it does not show. Fruity, resiny, grassy hoppy flavours, seem American. The roastiness is almost completely hidden, I am not sure if I could identify it blindly through all the hops. Overall very nicely executed cascadian dark ale.","Bratislava, SLOVAK REPUBLIC","Gurthnar"
