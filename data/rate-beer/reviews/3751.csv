That there is more, and richer, malt, than in a normal weizen is quite apparent on this nose as well. Highly carbonated (as expected), sweet, with a fair bit of apple-pear, and a strong, vaguely bready malt base, though one with a touch of plasticy phenols as well.

3751,"2016-05-18",3.9,"Pours dirty orange from the bottle. The head is bubbly and rapidly collapses. Lots and lots of evident carbonation. The aroma is yeasty. Taste trends sour at the outset, with an underlying sweetness. The carbonation is quite aggressive on the palate during the first few sips, much more in line with a soda than a bock beer. Then the surprise. The palate settles down and the beer takes on a new depth. The sourness becomes less pervasive, and an apple pie sweetness takes over. The aroma also becomes more nuanced, an interesting mix of ripe banana and pear settles over the yeasty background. 
By the end of my bottle, about 25 minutes later, the palate was very nearly flat. The swings in the palate are disconcerting. Amazingly despite 7.1% there was no trace of alcohol, and not even much warmth.

3751,"2015-05-27",4.5,"Standard bottle, poured into a weizen glass at ~40 degrees F.

Appearance: Pours a deep honey gold, so cloudy one can barely make out the shadows of their fingers on the other side of the glass, and forms a pale just-off-white head which dies away rather quickly. Lacing is fairly pedestrian.

Smell: Not unlike a wheat field near a mixed orchard of banana and pear trees bursting with ripeness, with bush-sized clumps of coriander and clove dotting the landscape.

Taste: Starting cold, this is heavy with coriander, intensely orange and citric, with supporting buttresses of banana and bubblegum flavors. As it warms, the coriander recedes to being one of several small towers, alongside the banana and bubblegum, with notes of clove and faint pear. It still strikes me as almost more wit-like than hefe-like.

Mouthfeel: Light, lively, bubbly, and refreshing.

Overall: A darned good beer, if not quite up to the standard of their Brau Weisse for me. This feels less like a concentrated weissbier and more like a blend of one with a wit, but thats hardly a bad thing in my book!","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

3751,"2014-06-24",4.7,"Mmmmm...I am really looking forward to saying something about this beer. Mmmmm...sigh, here goes. 
I poured this into a weizen glass.
The appearance was a nice light hazy golden yellow to medium orange color, a perfect cloudiness all the way through. There was a nice two finger white foamy head that dissipated within about a minute and a half. There was a nice amount of semi - thick lacing trying to stick to the sides of the glass but they slide for the most part. 
The smell, hmmm...where do I start. Sigh, uh...just a pretty much close to perfect banana/yeasty breadiness with just a tad of slight clove and I think even just a nice little vanilla as well. 
The taste was once again extremely emphasized by all of the previously mentioned flavors and allowing a super nice sweet sticky blend to allocate itself onto the aftertaste and finish. 
On the palate, this one sits about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. The carbonation seems to be appropriately styled and lends a hand to letting a nice creaminess to run along my mouth and tongue.

Pours a couldy brownish-orange with a one finger fluffy white head. Great head retention but really no lacing at all.

Aroma is the usual banana and spice notes but there is an extra touch of citrus in there that I was not expecting. A touch of caramel in the nose helps mix things up a bit.

The flavor has strong bubblegum and banana notes with some caramel lingering underneath. There are more subtle hints of spices in the way of coriander and some orange peel but i believe it is from the yeast. Alcohol is completely hidden and other than a fuller mouthfeel, there is no way to tell that this is stronger than a typical hefe.

3751,"2013-01-13",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 7, 2013 Pours a hazy light orange with a nice big off white head and decent lacing.  Smell banana, clove, caramel apple as well as some wheat character.  Same in test with also a little spiciness and impression of funk.  Sweet, bordering on cloying but not quite.  Medium body with semi smooth mouthfeel.  Semi high carbonation.

Taste: Similar to the nose. Banana first, wheat, faint clove.

Summary: Another really well made beer from Ayinger.  I enjoy the weizen bocks too as they are slightly less sweet then a traditional hefeweizen, and the extra alcohol doesnt hurt.","Maryland, USA","jcos"

3751,"2013-01-02",3.3,"Poured from a bottle to try my first ""Weizen Bock."" Color is a yellowish straw like color. The haziness of the beer makes it look darker. Large off-white head that dissipated quickly. No real lacing. Aroma of yeast, bread, maybe fruity, towards bananas.  Taste is full and creamy, like a thicker hefeweizen. Has a banana taste to it, but slightly tart. Alchohol is also present in the smell and taste. The thickness makes sense now since it is a winter seasonal. 






Tastes like a thicker and boozier hefeweizen. Quite heavy on the malts and on the booze, with a wholesome mouthfeel that makes it a very nice drink on its own in the winter, very warming and wholesome. 

Overall a good beer, not the best of the style though.","Tennessee, USA","jhgrantjr"

Leuchtendes Orange mit schöner Schaumkrone. Stark würziges Aroma; primär nach Nelke und Steinobst (Aprikose?). Der Antrunk ist vollmundig und kraftvoll. Geschmacklich wiederum sehr würzig und sähmig nach Banane im Hintergrund. Das Weizenmalz entfaltet hier seine ganze Aromenfülle. Im Nachgeschmack kommt die Steinobstnote (vielleicht doch eher Pfirsich) toll heraus. Für einen Weizen-Bock von hervorragender Süffigkeit! Probieren ist Pflicht!

S: Banana, cloves, bubblegum, coriander, a little apple, and a very faint noble aspect. Nothing groundbreaking, but it works very well.

T: Very much like a quality hefe, but sweeter on the whole. The banana on the opening is quite strong, while it finishes with a solid tartness from the apple-esque flavor, combined with a bit of spiciness. Alcohol is hidden very well, almost perfectly in fact, making this one quite dangerous.

M: Carbonation is on the high side...make that on the very high side (deriving from its bock strength, perhaps?), but is helped quite a bit by a smooth, somewhat creamy body. Superbly refreshing.

O: My only complaint is that the sweetness wears on me a tad as I progress through the beer. Otherwise, it strikes me as a unique twist on the classic hefe, and along with its stupid drinkablilty factor, makes it one thats well worth diving into.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

Pours a very cloudy light golden color with a dense white head that sticks around for a bit. Some spotty lacing on the sides of the glass and a thick collar throughout.

Floral hop notes link up with faint clove and sweet bubblegum and curb the starchy wheat. Banana profile isnt overly vibrant, and the chalky yeast and plastic notes prolong the dullness. Fermented-wheat fruitiness harmonizes with a baked apple twang. Closes sufficiently sassy yet somewhat dull with a pear, putty, and mashed banana mixture.

Appearance: From the pour I got a tall three to four finger head of slow fading stiff foam over a cloudy flat tan/orange colored liquid. Lots of visible carbonation flows up to the head which also makes lots of slick lace patterns on the glass.

Smell: The nose is full of estery, fruity and bready yeast notes.

Taste/Palate: The flavor has loads of tasty wheat character. There is a semi-sweet mix of bread malt, tart wheat and hops with a twist of lemon and green banana peel. The finish leans more to the dry side with a very mild hop presence. Its palate feels lively and well carbonated with a firm medium body.

3751,"2011-02-21",4.1,"Got some of this from the. original import shipment, it seems like it is a Winter seasonal now judging by the label art. 7.1% alcohol, Im expecting a REA imperial Hefeweizen.

Pours into my non branded weizen glass with a huge white head. The head is kind of watery and doesnt for the big mounds of fluff like most weizens do. No lacing whatsoever. The beer is a hazy goldish with hints of orange Hefeweizen color with golden edges.

Smells pretty damn good for this style. You get the typical Hefeweizen notes like banana, wheat, and clove but with an infusion of black licorice and some other spice perhaps. You can even pick up the alcohol in the scent.

The taste is heavier and sweeter than a normal Hefeweizen. Has some lemon, clove, and banana in the taste along wiht osme creamy vanilla and black licorice in the finish. The yeast adds a nice tang to it aswell.

The carbonation is prickly and active, but not over the top, lending to a fair drinkability. The alcohol becomes more apparent as you go.

This is a great wheat beer for the Winter, proves you can have it year round for all those naysayers out there.

3751,"2011-02-17",3.6,"UPDATED: APR 27, 2016 My Bottom Line:
Heavy banana wheat bread flavors build this Weizenbocks thick signature, while alcohol and clove-y phenolics add depth. 

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy head of foam covers the dark, cloudy golden.
-The soft, natural carbonation is not able to alleviate the relative heft of the mouthfeel.
-The cereal sweetness is honeyed at times.
-This is one expressive yeast, folks.
-This is a good, hearty Weizenbock, but Id prefer better attenuation myself.

The classic wheat malt crispness shines through.  Mouthfeel is soft and full with a nice sparkle from the carbonation. Drinkability is almost TOO good for a beer with that packs a 7.1% abv punch.

3751,"2010-08-26",3.8,"A solid pour nets me a fluffy, four-finger thick head in my 25cl tulip glass that is a pale tan color.  The beer is a murky looking gold / amber color that shows  a deeply hazed, bright orange / straw color when held up to the light.  I wasnt expecting a Helles Weizen Bock, but I am quite happy to see one.  As I am pouring this characteristic aromas of clove and banana are quite noticeable.  A more focused inspection of the nose yields lots of banana backed by spicy clove notes in the finish as well as a touch of white pepper.  Underneath are aromas of grassy grain, a rustic grain character that reminds me of fresh crushed wheat, perhaps a touch of fruity apple notes.  This has a nice, characteristic aroma that I am definitely digging.

Somewhat dry tasting, at least I was expecting more sweetness in a Bock version, though there is a hint of complex wheat sweetness that is a suggestion towards the finish.  There is a nice bite to the finish that is a combination of spicy yeast character, hop bitterness and a carbonic bite.  This has a really nice grain flavor to it, chewy, rustic, a bit hay-like and lightly tart in its wheat character.  Soft flavors of banana, and perhaps even some sweet / tart green apple are noticeable here.  This has a nice lush texture to it, chewy, almost toothsome at times; I have had normal strength Hefes with this texture, but this is a bit chewy compared to most normal strength versions.  This beer is so drinkable though, my first pour of this disappears way faster than I was expecting it to.

This is a very tasty beer; it really hides its strength quite well, which is certainly dangerous in a 7.1% beer.  I really like how vibrant the traditional Hefeweizen character is here; it definitely seems like the character volume has been turned up a bit, which is really then only, subtle, sign that this is not a traditional strength Hefewiezen.  Very tasty and one that I am definitely enjoying, this must be an absolutely killer beer when it is fresh.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3751,"2010-04-11",3.8,"Enjoyed from a 16.9oz bottle in a whiskey snifter.  The beer pours a light amber color, with a sizable and fairly dense white head.  The nose brings a nicely complex combination of classic banana and clove hefeweizen esters, along with notes of Munich and perhaps rostmaltz.  The palate begins fairly fruity/estery, but refrains from being the sort of banana fruity bomb that typify so many American attempts at this and similar styles.  This transitions over to a nice depth of malt character, before ending with a slightly sweet and slightly estery (again, not over-the-top) finish.  Alcohol is extremely well hidden.  No hop bitterness or flavor is detectable.  Carbonation levels are perfect.  Overall, clearly one of the archetypes of the style.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

Over a bready/toasty bed, phenolic linens procure spicy, clovey, borderline medicinal aromatics while banana bread, apple flesh&rhubarb (without the tartness) and litchi fruitiness provide ample complexity. Highly carbonated on the tongue, its initially explosive bubbles settle to an intense, albeit lightening motion for its considerable malt base. Full toasty breadiness develops an obvious biscuit character as honeyed wheat evocates candied breakfast cereals. Despite its strong maltiness, the yeasty nature and refreshing wheat bill remove any suggestion that this is too sweet. It remains very drinkable from the first to last sip.

Some requisite clove and a touch of bubble gum.  Flavor has more of the big, rich wheat malt and some banana and spice.  Light, warming alcohol.  Less of the bubble gum, but bigger clove and hints of vanilla and cream.  Medium body is smooth and creamy with lively carbonation.  Big malt presence with just enough bitterness to balance and keep it from being overbearing.  Alcohol comes through in the finish, but isnt distracting.  Lingering spice.  Overall a super beer.

A relatively pale take on the style, though I suspect some munich malt got thrown in there, lending a deep bready and bready-crust maltiness that stands up to the alcohol and spicy banana.   Typical baked banana bread aroma with a dusting of clove.   They got a good attenuation in this though, which makes it quite drinkable, while still packing a lot of malt flavor in.   Yeasty and not really bitter at all, with ripe banana giving way to a generally clean finish.   Medium bodied with ample carbonation.   Very nice for a paler weizen bock, but I still miss the chocolate notes that you get in something like Aventinus.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Cloudy golden, thick firm lasting head, abundant streams of carbonation, some lacing. Flavor is of fresh underripe bananas. My experience with weizen beers is that they tend to taste more like overripe bananas, which makes this a little unusual. Not nearly as much clove on the palate as on the nose.

3751,"2010-01-25",3.9,"At first glimpse, this appears lighter than the typical Weizenbock. This brew is light peach in color and poured an overly luxurious cream head that filled 2/3 the glass. The invigorating presence of yeast and wheat swell the bouquet that has a complex medley of restrained phenols, including clove, banana, vanilla, and touches of uric acid. On the palate, this demonstrates a full bodied 1-2 of wheatiness and yeastiness with the complex presence of phenols again demonstrating moderations. Zesty flavors with mild clove and banana that increases at the sweet yeasty malt finish.

The flavor is spot on- massively bready with huge notes of lemon-orange citrus, nectar fruits, banana, clove, and a pleasant dry smacking characteristic which is presumably from the abv. The palate is medium bodied with the perfect effervescence- pillowy and caressing. The finish is semi dry, and wholly clean.","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"

Great bread and grain character, not in the bad way that those traits are often -- tastes like a beautifully homemade loaf. On top of that are beautiful citrus and tropical fruit notes, along with the aforementioned spices. Palate is full and flavorful, but still immensely drinkable -- Im having trouble not just throwing this down my gullet. This is an awesome weizen bock, and one of the better German beers Ive had.

3751,"2009-12-10",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 8, 2015 125h rating for this beer - my 19th Weizenbock and easily my favorite.  Bottle.  Ooooh baby!  Bottle itself hasnt even been recycled yet.  Nose is super malty, dry though, light brown sugar and light cloves.  Light golden body (surprisingly so) with visibly strong carbonation.  Head is a pillow, soft and densely bubbled.  Medium body, soft and smooth.  Taste of medium bananas, heavy bubblegum, seemingly a little candy sugar, indistinct berry.  Malt profile is gentle on the whole but theres a frisk side lurking under the surface.  Aftertaste is dry and pure honey-malty goodness.  Vanilla, cream, light meringue, light lemon zest.  Light and refreshing, no muddy or grainy malt, absolutely no sign of the strongish alcohol.  A pleasure to drink, and an extremely promising offering for a style that was leaking hope.  Manna, poetry, gift of the ancient eagle, stolen by Odin and given to man to reward his faith. [2009.12.10: 4.5]Another bottle, coincidentally almost on the sixth anniversary of my last.  Spice sets this apart from many other bocks, weizens, and weizenbocks, as does the great creamy-yeasty underpinning.  Fruit melds perfectly with citrus, perfect crispness and full of life.  Touch, oily-sticky, late-arriving grape, alcohol makes itself known (more like 9%!) but doesnt hurt.  Really strong, bright wheat.  Bubblegum getting a little out of control, but otherwise a killer!  And I like how this maintains identity as a supercharged HW rather than a mutt. [2015.12.08: 4.3]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

The finish is light-moderately spicy with some clove.  Its medium bodied and the carbonation is lively but never gets to the point of being prickly.

Flavor follows, one of the most banana tasting beers Ive every tried, sharp sweet banana taffy, with supporting nutty, yeasty and spicy notes, almost like the banana is perfectly framed by the subtleties.  Finishing more nutty and yeasty with a trailing off just a bit hot, lingering banana candy.  Medium bodied, fuller, thicker syrupy, sparkling carbonation helps relieve the viscosity.

Just a tad strange though, with a banana-pineapple-pepper taste - good, just hit me a bit odd. What I do have to really give this beer is its wonderful palate.

Visible carbonation bubbles bum-rush the surface of the beer.  The head just sticks around and around and around.  Some light passing through the beer but generally a medium clarity.  Aroma, aroma, aroma, what can I say about the aroma... its exactly what the Germans do best (no not kill), make beautiful and bountiful wheat beers.  Aroma is fully of grainy, brown banana smells.  Its wunderbar, love the esters, very well done, I could smell this for a while.  The grainy aspect and a very earthy type of banana ester versus an overly fruity one makes this very good aroma. Flavor is toned down dark banana esters as well.  A nice estery beer without being overly fruity.  A nicely fuller yet light mouthfeel really works well with the structure of the beer.   500mL bottle in a Blind Tiger Brewery weizen glass, was able to pour the whole bottle and still have room to spare.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

3751,"2007-10-16",4.8,"0.5L on draft at Ayingers Speis und Trank during 2007 Oktoberfest in Munich
When youre tired of the tents and fairgrounds of Oktoberfest and want to sit and savor some of the greatest liquids on Gods green Earth, walk through the Marienplatz and head to Speis und Trank.  This beer was 0.5L of heaven in a glass.  Truly a memorable dark wheat offering from one of the best brewers youll find (in my humble opinion, obviously).  Wonderful clove aromas augment a beautiful malt flavor that just seduces the front of your taste buds.  I believe that this beer went into a wooden barrel less than 24 hours before I drank it.  The freshness was that apparent.  This is a near-perfect brew, one that did not disappoint my lofty expectations for Ayinger.  On par for this style in quality as is Ayingers Celebrator for the doppelbock style.  Damn fine.","Lexington, Massachusetts, USA","mvcramer"
