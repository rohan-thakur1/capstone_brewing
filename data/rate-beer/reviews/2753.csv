2753,"2008-04-07",3.7,"Back from a Czech Republic pub-crawl this is part of my express ratings for the typical Světlý 11°- (Czech light Pils), Světlý 12°+ (Czech Pils), Polotmavý (Czech Amber Lagers) and Tmavý (Czech Black Lagers).  Non-typical beers will receive personalized descriptions after the express ratings.-------- />
How: Tap at brewpub (Pivovar Bata, Prague)
The look: Cloudy amber body with a large beige head
To me a typical Czech Polotmavé (Czech Amber Lagers) is: Hay and biscuit wrapped in caramel.  Very light fruity notes with no specific fruits giving the impression of slightly fruity caramel.  Moderately sweet.  Sweetness is well balanced by dry grassy hops.  Body is smooth.  Medium carbonation.
This one: As above with the dry grassy hops head-to-head with a surprising lemony tartness in the finish.  More refreshing but less involving.  Still very good.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
2753,"2008-03-31",4.0,"En fût. Pinte dégustée à la brasserie. Arôme: Odeur dhoublon et de malt légèrement caramélisé. Apparence: La couleur est ambrée légèrement voilée. Présence dun large col crémeux et dune large dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Léger goût de caramel. Durée moyenne de larrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une etxture légèrement crémeuse. Faible effervescence en bouche. Légère présence de caramel en arrière goût. (Rating #1532)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","TaktikMTL"
2753,"2008-03-24",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2008 My Bottom Line:
A caramel of cranberries develops quasi maple syrup trails as its luscious body slides down effortlessly. This highly talented Polotmavé is a feast for the malt lover.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A block of solid foam sits atop the hazy copper.
-That fruity caramel is complex and never too sweet; just expertly extracted.
-Subtle hop bitterness does not quite achieve balance, but I dont care in this case.
-The fruitiness ramifies into plums, cherries or cranberries as it moves across the tongue.
