1225,"2017-06-12",3.7,"A hazy dark brown Pour with a big tan head that settles quickly. The aroma is sour, not at all what I was expecting. The flavor is more what I was expecting. Oak and vanilla. Lots of dark fruit. The whiskey comes thru and the throat burns on the swallow. The finish had a bit of a bite yet it's quite mellow. Excellent

1225,"2016-05-05",3.7,"Bottle. Pours a clear dark amber body with a minimal fizzy head that vanished completely. The nose is just the right amount of boozy, just enough bourbon and alcohol to let you know its barrel aged. Some sweet toffee and caramel malt under the barrel. The flavor is a really nice balance between the sweet toffee and caramel malts and the bourbon flavor. For all the bourbon flavor, the alcohol isnt all that more prominent than the original version. Some lingering warmth on the finish along with a good bit of oakiness. Rather full bodied with a slight cling and slightly fizzy carbonation. Rather good stuff, glad to see this available without waiting in line anymore!","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate chocolate, light caramel, brown sugar, bourbon, oak, and a touch of mint. It pours a dark brown with some red transparency when held to the light. It has a small khaki head that quickly fades to a minimal film outlined by a thin ring. The flavor starts with moderate caramel, light chocolate, and brown sugar. There are some very faint roasty notes in the background. The finish has light-moderate vanilla, bourbon, faint oak, and a touch of mint.

1225,"2015-03-28",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 29, 2015 Bottle: Thanks, Chris. Lazy pour; cloudy dark brown with a mild ruby tint. Some mild tan foam quickly recedes to a ring. Really nice aroma of caramel candies, vanilla, light butterscotch, hints of wood, cocoa dust, a touch of prune, mild alcohol, & buttery toffee. Flavor is a bit more restrained, but has lots more woody barrel notes with a big tannin presence. Oaky staves wrapped in vanillin, mild molasses, & toffee, showing hints of anise, cocoa dust, & strong bourbon in the finish. Get a touch of prune & black cherry as it fades out, too. Body could be a little heftier, its a touch over-carbonated. But overall, a nice beer.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"

1225,"2013-02-08",4.3,"Just go try one already. I cant add anything new to review below. They pretty much summed it up. Im not going to bend your ear repeating the same stuff. The bourbon is more pronounced on the nose than the finish. Finish more woody and vanilla than bourbon. Barreling really calmed this beer down and cut down on the sweetness of the normal Troegenator. Try as hard as you can to let it warm up for 10-15 minutes first. You will be glad you did. So lucky to have this as my neighborhood brewery. Cheers","Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","mfaulke"
1225,"2013-01-30",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2014 A - Pours deep, dark brown with a small half finger tall off white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving little to no lace down the glass. Goes pretty dead about halfway through the glass.


S - Smells of rich bourbon, caramel, vanilla, toasted coconut, toffee, mildly toasted grains and a touch of booze. Very nice balance of aromas once the bourbon dies down a bit. 


T - Starts off with the typical troegenator flavors - toasted grain, caramel, toffee - quickly giving way to hints of coconut, vanilla and warm bourbon. The flavors work very well together and the booze is hidden fairly well, only really becoming assertive at the end of the glass. Finish is sweet with some nice booze burn, leaving the palate dried long after the finish.


M - Medium body with moderate to low carbonation. Smooth, sweet feel with some warm booze at the end of each sip. Like most fresh BA beers, the booze only really gets in the way at the end of the glass.


O - It is about time they do something like this. I was beginning to wonder if all of those barrels sitting back there were empty.....The bourbon works very well with the base beer, yet not overpowering it. Get it while you can, it will be gone before you know it.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
