3609,"2014-09-30",3.6,"Tap at FFF. Filtered copper-orange-brown body. Massive off-white/beige head. Smooth and easy, clean malt tones and a zesty hop balance. Rather plain and straightforward.

3609,"2014-04-26",3.5,"This one was not what I was expecting.... I mean 3 Floyds for an ESB, one expects an IPA or close to, right? I mean not the same malt profile, but a good hop profile? This was weak sauce in a way. In another way, very drinkable.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AndyReynolds"

3609,"2014-04-05",3.4,"Can, thanks to John (jmgreenuk) split at Colin and the Vikings ""pre"" tasting, Nol, Goteborg, Sweden 22/03/14. 
Very lightly hazed golden amber with a good sized off white head that thins then retains.
Nose is biscuit malt, caramel, tropical fruit notes, earthy hops, bitter orange.
Taste comprises caramel malt, tea bags, hops, bitter orange, light pine.
Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close.
Nice easy drinker, not true to style - usual We cant stop throwing hops at it US take on a British style, more like an APA than a bitter but decent none the less. This is why US brewers hit top 50 lists on British styles - they arent true to style simple !","Hazlemere, the lower Xhitlerns, Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Theydon_Bois"

The aroma offers up floral hops, grainy malts, doughy bread and a dash of lime. The taste starts with a nice lime and floral hop bite with a modest malty base that has some biscuit malt and light malt sweetness to it. This is pretty good stuff with plenty of balance and interest.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

3609,"2013-12-30",3.2,"Tall boy can thanks to DrewFace. Pours a clear red color with a large off white head. Nose is full of orange zest and light fruitiness. Taste is similar, kind of an orange juice note to it. No real malt flavor. Pretty tasty. Finishes with a bit of alcohol warming. Not very bitter and lacking in malt, but very quaffable as advertised.

Nose involves clean doughy yeast, light pine, sugar, fruit, and some herbal notes. Lightly sweet, fairly bitter. Light to medium bodied, fair carb, with a drying tea-leaf finish.

3609,"2013-12-06",3.6,"Pours a light amber color. Citrusy earthy hop aroma. Grainy, husky, malt character with some mild hop flavor. Not over the top as you expect from FFF.","Melbourne, Florida, USA","DrewFace"
3609,"2013-12-05",3.3,"Draft @ the 3 FFFs on 30 November, 2013. Got to say this is not a style I drink very often. 
Aroma of toffee type malt and old hops. Flavors again are toffee and old fruity hops. Dry malty body with plenty of bread and traces of nuts, with a fairly sweet finish that is balance by some light dry hopping. Im not really a lover of the style so I just dont have much to say other then I believe the brewers hit the mark they are after and it does resemble every Bitter I have ever tasted. Easy to drink with the low ABV, maybe my palate was off after all the other brew I sampled. I will give this the benefit of doubt. Perhaps a cask would give it more of an English feel and likeness.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
3609,"2013-12-04",3.9,"Tap @ the FFF brewpub, served in an Imperial pint glass: light amber or deep golden hue (take your pick) topped by a solid off-white head and very good lace. The aroma has notes of slightly herbal, grassy and peppery hop esters that also produced faint apple and pear notes. The malt is bready and grainy that props up the hops well. The taste is a smooth malty character but is not sweet, clean bready and biscuity quality that allows the hops some space to be noticed on the finish. Smart carbonation for the style, smooth and extremely sessionable. I liked this a lot, a nod to the genre but with just the right amount of American twist.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
3609,"2013-12-03",3.2,"Draft @ FFFs. Earthy caramel malt and subdued musty hops aroma. Clear amber with a moderate off-white head. Earthy caramel malt flavor. Body on the light side of medium, soft carbonation.","South Whitley, Indiana, USA","queenholly"
3609,"2013-12-02",2.9,"The beer appears transparent and light orange with an inch of sticky, off-white head. The aroma brings hops, biscuits, perhaps a touch of nectarines. The flavor has a candied orange / nectarine vibe that is clashin with the bitterness and malty body. A bit odd and off kilter. Not horrible, but not refreshing and quaffable either. Eh...","Washington DC, USA","Huhzubendah"
3609,"2013-11-30",3.4,"Enjoyed on tap at 3 Floyds in Munster, IN while eating with some friends for a birthday. Appearance is a bright orange amber with a thin white head.

3609,"2013-11-07",3.5,"Draft on tap Three Floyds Brewpub (Munster, IN). Nice to get a chance at this. Pours a deep copper red hue, no haze, transparent deep dark reddish copper hue, almost brownish chestnut glow and some lighter tea and slightly brighter life on the edges and bottom where the light catches it. A cakey tannish head atop offers some nice life, good layer remains and laces ok. Good stick around as a firm layer. Aromas show a gentle subtle sweetness, bread and gentle biscuity quality meet a firmer dry hopping, earthy and mellow florals hit the nose. Decent bitterness, alpha acids. Some mellow grapefruit rind sneaks in, some gentle juiciness, rind oils meet some lemon. Initial is fairly session worthy, a bit of girth in the body doesnt necessarily make it light, with some toastiness, distinct carmelized and caramel malt grips. Some gentle nuttiness meets some firm florals, gentle resiny dryness that hits the palate. Subtle grapefruit rind. A bit sweeter than anticipated. Middle is some gentle sun tea, biscuits, and gentle toffee. Some oranges, gentle grapefruit. The citrus element is there but gets chased away a bit. A touch more session worthy with a firm more dry hop bite into the backend, citrusy and floral jabs meet that biscuity and carmelized malt feel. Firmer florals, a bit more spritzy, lighter back here where this starts to earn its stripes so to speak, as a session worthy Bitter with a decent hop bite. Some bready malts, a bit lighter overall back here with some gentle dryness, florals and earth as just a subtle citrus element hangs on, dying out from the initial brunt we started to get. Some nice hop presence really hits at times, especially backend and finish as we settle in, let this one get accustomed to the palate. Really grows on me. A touch thicker than Id like as a sessioner at times but overall, the hop presence does eventually deliver. Solid. While I imagine this expertly constructed for what it is, the hop presence is pretty spot on, just perhaps a faint touch heavy on the body. That said, this is neat stuff, kinda like an American Bitter.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
3609,"2013-11-03",4.1,"Pours clear brown amber with off white head. Aroma is caramel toffee malts and a bit of pine hops. Very light body, super crisp and refreshing. Caramel and toffee malt flavors with a little bit of roast in there giving it a slight bitterness on the malt side. Little bit of pine bitterness on the hops side giving it a very sharp crisp flavor and texture which the active carbonation adds to. Also got a little bit of citrus hops to it and a tiny bit of sweetness. Not usually my favorite style but this is a pretty great session beer.","Iowa, USA","joshmcg000"

3609,"2013-10-30",3.9,"Crystal clear, dark amber pour with a 1 finger, creamy off white head that has great retention and leaves decent lacing. Aroma of caramel malt, crusty sweet white bread, earthy, planty and light citrus hops, a touch of tree fruit, lots of warm toastiness and hints of toffee. Flavor is very toasty, slightly nutty and sweet tree and figgy fruit up front, then some nice bready and earthy notes come in followed by dry roasted nuts, toffee, light grassy, fuggles like planty, citrus and pine notes. Light body with creamy entry, leading immediately to nicely dry feel, medium strength, blanketing carbonation. Pretty damn good. I could definitely wash down some fish and chips, or a nice pork tenderloin or burger with this stuff.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"
3609,"2013-10-30",3.8,"I rated this beer in my living room, from a well designed 16 oz. can and poured it into a pint glass. A rich aroma with a heavy earthy sent. I can keep my nose in this beer all day long. A wonderful flavor that lingers with you through out the drink. You can taste an explosion of roasted, caramelized malts in every sip. It isnt over powering on the bitterness, which is my only disappointment, but this isnt an ESB (Extra Special Bitter) It is an English-Style Bitter and Ive now learned the difference between the two :) I can enjoy this beer on a regular basis, great work guys, makes me proud to be a Hoosier!!!!","","navajojoe"
