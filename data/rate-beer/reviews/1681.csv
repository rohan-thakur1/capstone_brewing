Mediocre to solid coffee stout. Pleasant aroma, good flavour, decent body. Nothing stands out as being particularly great, but there are no obvious negatives, either. If that sounds like Im damning it with faint praise, well, maybe I am - it could certainly stand to be a bit bolder, particularly after the initial coffee hit subsides, and although the body is OK, it could be heavier.

1681,"2014-06-12",3.3,"September 9th, 2012 - Second to last on the taster tray at Coronado Brewery here is the Blue Bridge Coffee Stout. San Diego has a wonderful array of coffee roasters to choose from, though I dont know if any of them were picked for manufacture in this stout. If not, all the coffee notes are there, resoundingly sweet and bitter, though definitely more of a light roast flavor profile than French. The mid to after taste, though, is more of a stale coffee taste, and then in the very late after taste I get a sudden burst of rich, espresso flavor, with a puff of cocoa powder adding that complementary sweet and bitter. The aroma is more consistent and regular in the flavor, featuring a rich malted and chocolate milk smell, with a touch of hazelnut. This is a lighter coffee treatment than many other coffee stouts I have had, and overall good, though that background note of stale coffee that pokes its head here and there mars an otherwise tasty brew.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

1681,"2013-05-29",3.8,"Appearance:
Black with a thick crema hued head which slowly fades into a solid layer of crema that tries to crawl up the sides of my glass. Dense impenetrable darkness  more charcoal than motor oil. Visually appealing.

Nose:
Coffee! Roasted beans and instant coffee and cold press spent grind and burnt caramel, ohmy. Black chocolate flakes in the middle with a chocolate truffle powder dusting just for good measure. Delicate tobacco leaf notes on top are also dusted with truffle powder and finely ground coffee.

Palate:
Delicious! Medium weight with a soft chocolate cake mouthfeel. Coffee is front and center followed by a generous coating of chocolate. Fresh cold press coffee and burnt caramel crema in the back. Dark fruits along the sides, stones included for a touch of bitter nutty tannins. Tobacco oils underneath carry all the flavors from start to finish  subtle and never overpowers. The roasted coffee and unfettered cacao never stops. Black woods and black earth in the back.

Final Thoughts:
This is a stout that speaks of a different time and place which could either be an old café or even older black forests. With each quaff it was a sense of time and place and though I dont partake of coffee anymore, the Blue Bridge Coffee Stout would make a great breakfast imbibement. Cheers!

1681,"2013-03-11",3.3,"Appearance: average dark brown pour, with a thin, fizzy light tan head; the look does not inspire.   Aroma: big whiff of very dark roast coffee, approaching espresso, over a collection of dark malts, including chocolate and burnt pumpernickel.   Taste: dark and malty, with coffee (obviously), chocolate, a bit of smoke, toast, vanilla, and maybe some cinnamon.   Finish: surprisingly brief and clean for such a full-flavored beer, with only a bit of lingering roasty malts.   Notes: Many coffee stouts have an almost bright acidity that is pretty off-putting when not in balance.  This beer is loaded with coffee aromas and flavors, but somehow they are able to avoid falling into this trap.  While the palate was a little too light, and it wasnt much to look at, the flavor and aroma were special.","Maryland, USA","JDBaker11058"

Pronounced charred/roasted grain and coffee aromas that follow directly into the flavor.  The body is quite light for a stout and has a cola-like feel to it.   I think the coffee is partly responsible for the body being thinner and its not a bad thing, just strange for a stout.   Theres a real charred wood dryness in the flavor and the body.   Theres bitterness evident, but hard to tell if its from hops or the roasted malt.   Dark chocolate and bitter cocoa appear later in the taste and become more evident as the beer warms.   Finishes dry, thin and charred just like it started.   A good coffee stout that I think would benefit from some more body.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"
