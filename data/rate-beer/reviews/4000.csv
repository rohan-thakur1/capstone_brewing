4000,"2017-04-30",4.0,"This a DIY version, using the two cans to make a black and tan. It may have slightly more Yang (IPA) than Yin (Stout).

I tried to do the layering with the spoon but I dont have the right type of spoon so it never works out well. Blended, it is a dark, dark brown, nearly black.

Aroma isnt that strong, but 

Taste is chalky mocha coffee with a lovely piney finish on top. It is malt-forward but also not devoid of hop. The malts are burnt cookies. The malt comes out strong at the top, but later on, the hops take over, coating the palate with a very strong woody finish.

The feel is kind of sandpapery, smooth but also with a gritty texture. Its really a kind of wonderful beer, balancing the sweets and the bitters of both beers really well. Its an incredibly difficult dance but Yin/Yang does it right.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"
4000,"2017-04-23",4.4,"At Dans. Now Yin in its own right was great, but possibly a little too carbonated. Yang also great, possibly a little too sweet maybe. But Yin and Yang at one third / two thirds has created something even more special and the combination works so well. Deliciously smooth, with softer carbonation, and balanced sweetness. Lovely!","Ipswich, Suffolk, ENGLAND","Grumbo"
4000,"2017-04-05",4.1,"Oneness from duality. Giant hop monster makes sweet love to a delicious impy stout. Serenity in a pint glass. Good beer, in other words. Beautiful pour, dark and mysterious with a mighty head and voluminous lace. Aroma leans mostly stout, chocolate and coffee backed by light pine. Taste starts with a bold mocha sweetness, milk chocolate and espresso, with a growing bitter streak laced with pecan and pine and orange. Anise and raisin on the finish. No alcohol present despite the 10% ABV. Wonderful brew. Cant wait to try to the individual parts.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

4000,"2016-05-08",4.1,"330ml bottle from Beervana. Pours a deep black color with a medium light brown head that diminishes into a small film that lingers. Aroma is amazingly intense, a battle between the hops and the roasted malts without a clear winner. Huge hoppy notes of grapefruit, mango, citrus, pine and tangelo, battling the charry, licorice, molasses and dark espresso from the roasted grains. The ""middle of the road"" that summarizes the smell is a black olive character. Taste is bitter from two different angles, strong green/orange hoppy flavors and dark roasted coffee-ish notes. The result is a blend of incredible intensity. Ripe and rich flavors overwhelm the tastebuds. Delicious. Body is big and bold. Alcohol presence is well-concealed although the warming effect contributes nicely to the feeling of immensity. Low carbonation.

Pours a very dark brown with a huge fluffy khaki head with some lacing on da glass.

The aroma is mildly sweet with some chocolate and some herbal on fruity hop character. Its got a touch of booze & some prune...but its chill. 

The flavor is bitter enough to be labeled bracing but far from astringent, & sweet enough but far from unbalanced or cloying. Its certainly tipped towards the Hoppier end with a big fruity & leafy hop presence with a lingering herbal bitterness. In fact the bitterness seems decidedly more hop driven than malt driven... there is a decent enough bit of roast and even a lingering sort of espresso character to it. Its got some dark chocolate as well. Maybe because Im expecting the stout characteristics I dont mind them so much, but its funny... I normally reject big roastiness in a Black IPA (not to say that this is strictly such) but yeah somehow this seems to balance better than your typical roast heavy black IPA.

I never tried Yang, since...well...Danish IIPA, right? Gonna be a resin bomb. But I enjoyed Yin a fair bit so I figured Id see how this one fared. Its pretty much a resin bomb with a healthy dose of choco-roast aroma added. Fairly tart and astringent, with pretty aggressive bitterness, and not quite enough sweetness to balance all that. So its honestly fairly mediocre...drinkable but just not enough aromatic allure or drinkability to keep me interested. Looks nice enough though.

Above normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and more in the finish. The flavor profile is intense, quite complex and reasonably balanced. It begins with a burst of sweetness that rapidly fades into a blended bitterness of hops and roast. As the bitterness fades, grapefruit rind and pine hop flavors become dominant.

Medium carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, moderately sticky, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice Black and tan style.

4000,"2014-10-19",4.0,"Location: 50/50 mix of the 12 oz bottles from Superstar - Huntington, 10/19/14


Aroma: The aroma is roasted malt and some juicy hop, but the roast come through more

Appearance: Pours much like Yin, dark brown-black, with a small light brown head and spotty lace

Flavor: The flavor is sweeter than Yin, a little fruity, some dry roast, and a clean, hoppy finish

Palate: The body is medium-plus, smooth and creamy, very easy drinking considering the ABV

Overall Impression: 
I couldnt resit, the bottles want you to do it, it seemed like most of the rates on here are from mixing, and Im clearly easily susceptible to (imagined) peer pressure. Plus, I needed something to do, as there are only 3 games on in the 4:00 block today. This makes for a nice mix. Somehow the mix is sweeter than either of the beers. I cant explain that, but I swear its true. The Double IPA is a little too sweet, but the Imperial Stout is pretty dry, and thus, I like the Black & Tan even more so than the Black or the Tan separately, even though both are very good on their own.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

The aroma is really like a great black IPA. Malt sweetness still holds up through all of this. Looks just like a stout, with the only possible difference being a slightly lighter head (off-white rather than tan). The taste is spot on - a really well balanced black IPA that has slight hops up front and at the end with great roast and smoky flavor in between. Kind of reminds me of Wookey Jack, but I think its even better tasting. Palate is effervescent enough to be a good IPA yet slick enough to be a good stout. Very interesting.

4000,"2013-11-02",4.1,"UPDATED: FEB 27, 2015 Mixing the two Yin and Yang beers:

Great looking red-black with a thick head that separates into two layers: off-white cream and light brown. Crazy lacing. Smells more like the Yin IPA, no very strong aroma. Taste starts with roasty malts and a hint of fruits and ends in nice medium-bodied dry hoppiness. Nice execution of IPA + stout. 

The single Yin & Yang beer:

33% stout and 67% IPA - similar ratio to what I've found when tastes best when mixing the two beers. Great balance between dark roasted maltiness and bitterness. Boozy. Very good.","HONG KONG","CacheManyHose"

4000,"2013-09-17",3.8,"11.2 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a very dark burgundy color. The head is a fluffy looking two finger mocha shade. Im damn impressed by the retention and the lacing it leaves behind. Really damn impressed by the latter especially.

S: Ohmigawd, it smells like someone blended a DIPA and an imperial stout in the same bottle! Both roasted malts and chocolate exist alongside citrusy hops and a toffee-like sweetness. For the uninitiated, anyone whos ever had Storm King will know what to expect here - that quality of roasted tobacco is hard to shake, and I like it.

T: Flavor wise, this first seems to err closer to the DIPA side (Yang) for me. The palate is awakened by leather, candy, and citrusy hops at first, with exhales that are pretty much pure candy-coated hops. It builds a touch of roasted malt and chocolate on the back end, and the more thats sipped, the more this seems to layer itself well: a charred, smoky quality comes out as this sits in the glass. One of my friends likened this to a ""black barleywine"" and I can see where he was coming from. And even better, the alcohol is well hidden.

M: The feel isnt the creamiest: definitely more like the DIPA portion than the stout one. Even still, its mostly a sweet-finishing beer with just a welcome twinge of dryness right on the back of the palate. Theres a slight prick on the tongue to suggest a hint of heat, picking up ever-so-slightly as it warms up even further. Still, for 11.1%, it drinks rather easily.

O: This isnt the most harmonious blend Ive ever had. But it may as well be the most harmonious pre-made blend Ill likely have. As much as I enjoy this, Id personally rather just buy Yin and Yang separately. Despite my mild reservations, this one is still quite good.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

4000,"2013-05-14",3.2,"In short: A sweet and very bitter strong dark ale.  Very harsh and aggressive.  Just ok.
How: Bottle 330ml, consumed one month after purchase, however fresh a Danish beer is a Vermont store.
The look: Clear dark ruby body topped by a medium tan head.
In long: Nose is strangely fruity (breakfast dark grapejuice, baked berries), hops resin.  Taste is generously malted, quite toasted, crusty bread, a surprising strong rye-like flavor (although no mention this beer is a rye-based), caramel, baked berries and other baked fruits, pine-tree, sharp bitter grapefruits, lots of hop resin.  Very sharp bitterness of high intensity.  For an 11% beer I must say it doesnt feel too sweet nor is the alcohol too bothersome.  Not a bad beer at all, but a bit too brutal for its own good.

4000,"2013-03-26",4.1,"The concept of a black ale with lots of aroma hops is very appealing to me, but unfortunately I often find that BIPAs tend to be too dominated by the roasted, stoutish notes, or the hops are drowning all other elements. Neither is the case with the Yin & Yang, this is finally a perfectly balanced BIPA (at least aromawise)! The very strong aroma contains truckloads of elements from both camps, both roasted notes, thick chocolate and dark caramel, but also a perfect amount of hoppy fruity notes. As always I find it a bit hard to pinpoint the exact fruits in such a beer, but the aroma is definitely tropical. This is close to perfection! In the glass it is very dark brown with a large, frothy, very light-brown head that reduces to islands and a partially covering film in short time. The head still leaves a good amount of lacing on my snifter. The taste is moderate sweet with a lovely heavy bitter long-lasting finish. The strong flavours are roasted, with lots of chocolate, some coffee, resin and tropical fruits like peach. There are also some quite strong alcohol notes, in a perfect beer the alcohol should be a bit better integrated. Despite the obvious alcohol the mouthfeel is very pleasant, the body is close to full, the texture is oily and the carbonation is moderate. Probably the best BIPA Ive ever had!

4000,"2012-10-02",4.2,"12 oz. from Bottleworks. Opposing yet complimentary forces. This beer is a ridiculous interpretation of the black IPA style.

And the taste is outstanding.  That citrus thing hits you in the nose at the first sip, and then a chocolatey, malty, coffee flavor, followed by gigantic hops and a little bit of IPA heat.
