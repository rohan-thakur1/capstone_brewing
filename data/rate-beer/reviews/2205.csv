P: Medium-full body with medium-high carbonation; medium-dry finish.

Tastes like toasted bread, caramel, apricot, nuts, and spices. More full-bodied than some, yet exceptionally smooth. Hops are definitely muted here. This brew is about the 1,100 pounds of toasted malted barley that went into making it. There arent many American-made fest biers that can top this.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

2205,"2016-01-10",2.9,"12 oz bottle shared with ebone1988. This was an extra from a trade a while back and placed into Dumpster Box No. 1. The pour is a clear orange ruby color with a light tan head that falls to a collar, leaving a light soapy residue on the glass. The aroma is really sweet. There is the general spice and malt to it, and it smells like an Oktoberfest should. I'm not a big fan of them, but they have a familiar smell. Malty, metallic, and spicy. The flavor is much of the same. A plain sweet malt and not a whole lot else. The spiciness faded right out, leaving a sweet malt behind. Not bad. The mouth feel is just weird. Somewhat thick with a light carbonation and a quick fading finish. The sweetness is all that's there, but it doesn't last. Strange, but not awful.

2205,"2015-11-05",3.0,"12 oz bottle, poured into a nonic pint at ~40 degrees F.

A: Pours a crystal-clear orange-gold, much like a burnished copper. Forms a decent finger head of foam that seems just off-white with a hint of orange, and dissipates fairly quickly. Carbonation is visible as fairly large bubbles clinging to the bottom of the glass, occasionally shooting for the surface.

S: The aroma reminds me of a caramel biscuit with crumbled cracker topping. Some faint notes of spice and earth roll about in the scent as well.

T: The first sip opens almost exactly as the nose suggests, a blend of crackery and biscuity malt with some light caramel drizzle across the top. That is swiftly joined by a heavy dose of earthy, spicy hop presence, covering the malt presence with a thick layer of freshly turned soil from a field used to grow a mix of white, green, and black peppercorns. Said hop presence maintains all the way through the finish, where the malt returns to a little more prominence as a peppered biscuit, and into the aftertaste, where it lingers overlong.

M: This is a smooth, medium-carbonated, fairly thin-bodied beer. If it werent for the hop presence, I could probably crush them down quickly.

O: While I love a good märzen, particularly the Ayinger (ironic given where Dan Carey spent a few months apprenticing), I primarily love them for showcasing malt with minimal hop presence. This beer stands that relationship on its head for me, and comes very close to triggering my supertaster reaction to hop-forward beer. While I can still drink it, and even enjoy some aspects of it, it is pretty far from my favorite märzen. If youre following any of my reviews because youre also a supertaster, you may want to give this one a miss.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

Original(3.1): This one is a near miss in my opinion. It has a nice overall malt character but it strikes me as being a bit too sweet and sticky to be truly drinkable and that is what it needs to be to be a great example of this style.

The beer is a rich red-amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, amber-gold hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells sweet and fruity with berry like notes that are backed with toasted, slightly nutty notes, a touch of whole grain crackers, and just a deep maltiness that becomes more noticeable the longer you dig.

The beer is fairly dry tasting, with perhaps a hint of sweet maltiness towards the end that brings out a bit of berry character. A toasted whole grain cracker note, a touch of light nuttiness, and a straw like pale malt note. The hops are lightly herbal, and provide a bit of bitterness to the finish, and likely accentuate the light berry notes found in the finish. The body is fairly light, but has just enough heft to it to keep it interesting on the palate.

2205,"2011-02-20",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2016 Good attempt from NG. It did well at our Oktoberfest tasting (among 16 others). It is not an Oktoberfest though, more just like a light Dunkel bier, i guess maybe like the amber beers of Bamberg.

RERATE:
this is an okto i feel ive at least had once in most of th years in between this review. It landed in the middle of the pack when tasting 33 of them blind last year. First impression: I do not remember this beer being so light. This is way lighter than I remember it being. I swear it used to be waaay darker. This is a beutiful brew. The aroma is full-throttle. It starts with almsot a hint of smoke, intensley herbal and resinous noble hops, hint of vinegar on the nose, it is also fruity, almost figgy. Complex, bold, and non-traditional. The flavor is a suprise. This is nothing like what I remember this beer being. It is sweet, honey-like malt character, strawberry, lower bodied mouthfeel but a bit silky. Has a hint of diacetyl, comes of kind of zwickel-like with a minerally breadcrust finish. This is a surprise. This has to be a new recipe. A visceral and interesting deviation on the oktoberfestbier.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
2205,"2011-02-02",3.0,"12 oz bottle from Woodmans. I wanted something lighter after four hours digging my car out of the snow, because Id carbed up on pretzels & hamburgers today. And finding this Oktoberfest on the shelves in January will not help its rating. Indeed, I caught oxidation as soon as I pooped the cap, but it went away. Still a whiff of skunk in my glass, but also a nose full of Vienna and light barley. Appearance is a bit light for the style, but its a nice clear beer. Taste is nice and smooth, with spicy German hops being delivered through the bubbles. Not much else to add, I just followed all the way down my glass.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

Sweet lager-like aroma undistinguishable as an Oktoberfest vs. a regular lager.  The flavor is smooth and does not have the unpleasant bitterness that some lagers have.  Im not the best at describing this style of beer, and in fact most of the time I dont care for the style, but I will say this is certainly in the top tier of Marzen/Oktoberfest beers I have tried.","Raleigh, North Carolina, USA","zizzybalubba"

More sweet bread with some grainy toast and a lighter, sweet caramel. Flowery with some fruit and a light grassy hop. A pinch of butter, but not diacetyl. Finishes fairly sweet and bready with a light, floral fruity hoppiness thats somewhat dry. Medium length aftertaste following a light, crisp body and a moderately lively carbonation. Overall, I wasnt too impressed with this Oktoberfest. I was hoping for more out of New Glarus, but oh well.

Strangely sweet and grassy aroma, the malt profile seems way more in depth than just munich malt, some munich malt rich caramel sweetness, but also like a white wine tanginess.

Aroma: grain - honey - that wonderful scent you catch when your outside at an oktoberfest, a little bit slosh buzzed - its cool weather, the german polka starts and you take a swig and while your nose is in your cup it catches a sweet whiff of none other than the smell that you can come to associate only with this time of year, the good company, and being buzzed in October. 

Taste: grain, honey, hint of jasmine - smooth, hint of orange. 

Palate: light - smooth

Overall: I highly recommend as a lighter octoberfest - this aint the beer you have to commit thirty-forty minutes to drink.

The colour is a reddish orange and just looks gorgeous in a dim lit room. Oh my, this tastes better than I remember!

Pours a beautiful, crystal clear, amber color. Head retains well. Smell is slightly floral, biscuity, and a hint of a lager-like smell (light DMS?). Pretty balanced between the malt and the hops; seems to have a higher level of hop flavor and bitterness. I seem to remember a rich smell of fresh malt, similar to that at the brewery or when I’m homebrewing, this doesn’t seem to have it as much. Carbonation is medium and it’s medium bodied; sits pretty good on the tongue.

2205,"2007-11-20",3.6,"10/20/2007:  New Glarus Staghorn Octoberfest Beer is a wonderful, bright orange/pale amber color that is quite clear.  There is a moderate level of carbonation and a diminishing beige/ivory head.  The aroma has some sweet pale malt along with a nicely noticeable level of sugary caramel.  The flavor is strong and lightly roasted with a smooth caramel quality and a hint of nuts (pecan?) and freshly baked bread or something.  The finish is nicely mild with some lingering sweetness along with a traces of a delicate floral hoppiness and a weak coffee-like flavor.  The mouthfeel clean and smooth with a medium to medium-full body.  I personally think that this is a really good Octoberfest and probably one of the best Ive had this season.

After taking a sip, I have to say I was expecting a bit more hops. I wasnt thinking anything crazy, but this one seems to be focused more on the malty qualities and is on the sweeter side, sporting some candied attributes.  It has a faint hint at biscuits with a barely tart finish.  All right for an Oktoberfest, I suppose. I just cant get into the style.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Taste is medium bodied, plenty of carbonation with flavors of sweetened caramel, roasted nuts, some spiced apple and a touch of honey.

I knew this was coming out soon but it still caught me by surprise on a beer run.  I now have five more to enjoy for the next few months to tide me over until the new year.  The Organic Pale Ale (the winter release) sounds like it could be interesting but doesnt quite get my blood pumping.  This is one that has been around for a while and Im glad to see it back.  Its not the best Oktoberfest beer but it is certainly well made.
Aroma / Appearance - Lively carbonation percolates from the bottom of my sampler glass throughout the rusty brown body.  Malt and cherry extract are the key components of a relatively simple nose.  I wasnt expecting much from an Oktoberfest though.
Flavor / Palate - Nutty malts fade quickly into walnuts and then nothing.  The dry finish leaves one wanting more - I could have easily had two more over the rest of the evening.  It is perfect for a cool fall day sitting on a porch.  Easy to drink and affordable I think Dan Carey should keep this in the annual rotation.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
2205,"2007-09-14",3.6,"This marzen pours a deep copper color from a 12oz bottle. Small sized quickly dissipating white foamy head. Aroma is fruity and caramel. A medium to full bodied marzen. The malts are caramel and fruity and not very sweet. The hops are spicy and earthy. Nice balance. The carbonation is fairly lively, but its a whole bunch of small bubbles. Nice Oktoberfest beer, lots of flavor in this one. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is crisp and dry. Aftertaste is slightly spicy and bitter.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

A bit drier and less sweet than I had expected from the style -- a bit like a Vienna lager but fundamentally on target. Perfect hop balance -- that is, light application thereof as the style dictates. Not quite as flavorful as other examples of the style. Ive had better, both of the style and from New Glarus.

The main reason why Im not overly fond of this Oktoberfest is the sugary, perfumy character the flavor has.  Its moderately malty and caramely in the flavor, but the sweetness tastes sugary.  I discern very little in the way of classic hops or bitterness, but I do get a floral, perfumy flavor and aroma out of this.  The nose is also mildly toasty.  Medium bodied, but the palate just seems a bit watery, especially in the short-lived finish.  Dark amber color is nice.  Pours a medium size off-white head that settles to a thin layer.

2205,"2004-12-10",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 7, 2005 2004  bottle compliments of Footbalm.  I was very interested to try a non-fruit New Glarus, after being very disappointed by the Rasp. Tart.  Pours a clear lightly rusty yellow-copper, small white head, lightly fizzy and mostly dissipating.  Aroma of light roast, moderately dry caramel and some earthy yeast tones.  Flavor starts out with a wonderful, authentic munich malt, caramelly and coppery, with tame, but flavorful yeast notes.  Wonderful progression to the finish, via a spectacularly creamy, smooth body, medium to medium full.  Finish while showcasing the even, balanced malt flavor, has some bitter hops which, while not too bitter, really arent necessary.  This beer could just fade in to the distance with wonderful meaty yeast and malt, dry grainy caramel and hints of rum-raisin and sweet shortbread.  The hops really seem to break up a blissful finish, but I have also been very anti-hops lately, to be fair.  Superb stuff.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Fuzzy, tight spritz to the carbonation. Tangy Munich blankets the palate with notes of toffee and roast. Vaguely fruity with hints of toffeed apple and dates. Lushly malty and bready, yet beautifully dry and well-attenuated, with a pleasantly spicy hop spine and anise hints, which relentlessly hold the sweetness at bay. Grainy malt and gentle roast astringency punctuate the dry firmness of the body. Finishes shyly hoppy with lastingly rich  date and bready malt flavors. Rock solid Märzen that would be perfect with a touch more hops.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Id rate it lower but at least it has an assertive flavor.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","DavidP"
2205,"2004-11-26",3.6,"A dark amber color with a moderate head. The aroma is caramel and nuts. The flavor is very malty and somewhat sweet with a nice hazelnut, caramel, and apple flavor.

2205,"2004-11-08",3.5,"12 oz bottle: great pour: golden bubbles fall throughout the brightly bronzed body, full sandy coloured head forms on top.  Brisk, cane sugar aroma with a soft malt bill filled with sweet raisins, lush red apples, and toffee.  Rich, nutty malt flavours, but without too much depth.  Quick, sweet palate that is slightly grainy and toasted.  Not my favorite Oktoberfest flavour, but a great aroma and fairly decent overall.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"

Pretty good.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"

2205,"2004-09-05",3.9,"I actually went to the brewery in New Glarus Wisconsin and sampled this one at one of the local ""Swiss-Colony"" taverns in town. Very fresh-tasting beer with a nice aroma of roasted malt. The taste is very crisp and clean with a slight bitter, toasted-almond aftertaste. Makes for a great beer to drink in the late fall or early winter months.","Addison, Illinois, USA","wheatbeerboy"
2205,"2004-09-05",3.8,"Appearance: clear, bright red color, good, 1/4"" white head.
Subtle aromatics, malty, yes, but not scraming about it. Some fruit notes, a touch coppery, and a bit toasted. 
Taste: nice little hops up front, soon settling back, very tasty. Medium bodied, lingering finish. Quite a different Oktoberfest, goes farther in some ways than others, more restrained in other ways. Still, owns its own unique complexity, less overtly malty-sweet. A bit metallic in the taste, with a very subtle, snappy malty flavor, ultimately crisp and dry in the end.
Staghorn embodies a beautiful contradiction, a malty beer thats not treacly-sweet. In a class of its own.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

A small khaki colored head and little carbonation. A very malty nose and some old leaves. There is also some toffee. The taste is also sweet and malty.

However, as the beer warms it smells exactly like a bag of dry dog food. Mouthfeel is medium to full for this style. Taste is hoppy and a little watery slathered upon a rich, somewhat fruity, malt backbone. Aftertaste is dry and remniscent of soda water. Overall a decent marzen.","Cochabamba, BOLIVIA","JonR888710"

2205,"2003-09-22",4.3,"Solid darkish copper color with a small puffy off-white head that sticks around a while eventually fading to nothing as its consumed and leaves sheets of lace that dispear fast to stick in webby lines and spots. Wonderful toasted aroma on this, touch of caramel and light floral dried hops, very crisply toasted with a hint of ripe fruity-like sweetness reminescent of a sour bread dough. Really becomes a sniffer as it warms. Taste is a nice toasty, lightly sweet mix of maltyness, very solid through and through. Sweetness is strong but subdued in its presense over an amazing and great little toastyness, some thinner caramel sits in the back with some light herbal/floral dried hops setting up the finish to end with a nice mellow crispness and light lingering sweetness. Medium body feel, lightly creamy aspect and a lovely finish. A very nice O'fest beer that goes down with ease. A new favorite to keep around, top notch and a cut above alot of the mish-mashy O'fest brews that every brewery seems to make. This one is done right. Great job New Glarus!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

Some undertone of a lively acidic nature crept upon the palate. A touch of allspice upon the finish. A medium-bodied brew with a soft mouthfeel. Quaffable marzen that could use a very slight increase of (saaz) hops to add a crisp edge.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"

2205,"2001-11-13",3.4,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2016 (2016) First one of these Ive had in probably - 4 or 5 years at the least.  Poured at a bit above fridge temp into a New Glarus pils glass, and waited for a while for the bounteous white foam to die.  It leaves thick Escher-like lacing (does that make sense?  No?  too bad) above the clear amber body....big malty nose, surprisingly not that sweet but quite full with light caramel and a fair amount of toasted character...moderately sweet front, nicely balanced caramel malts and paler varieties along with a hint of smokiness and burnt quality, just a touch oily in the mouthfeel; some pepperiness to finish, a bit low on the carbonation scale for the style I think, which is fine as its not too thick and never syrupy.  Overall still a very solid rendition; original rate was 3.3 but I feel justified in a bump up of a point.


(2001)The nose is the best part of this, big, malty, vinous and almost bock-like.  Appearance is nice and orange, but with little head and seemingly thin.  Flavor confirms this; some good maltiness typical of the style, but little complexity or spiciness, little hops and somewhat bland on the finish.  Ok, but not up to the brewers high standards.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
