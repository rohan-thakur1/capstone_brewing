234,"2017-03-09",3.6,"clean. crisp. refreshing. effervescent. just enough hops and bitterness to move it past the domestic lager category. a great tasting light brew that wont weigh you down.","","crispaire"
234,"2016-12-17",3.0,"Can. Straw malt aroma with notes of grassy hops and some spicy yeast character. Pours clear pale golden colored with a thin white head that has poor retention and little lacing. Starts with crisp straw malt flavor with a little bit of yeasty spice. Finishes dry and fairly clean with grassy hops. Not the best Kölsch, but solid.","","zoucrew102"

234,"2016-05-21",3.4,"Uma das melhores Kölsch que tomei. Dourada com pouca formação de espuma, mas que persiste o tempo todo. Boa presença de lúpulo e malte, tudo muito equilibrado, cereais, fermento e um toque frutado.","","brewerale"
234,"2016-03-02",2.5,"Draught at Portland Craft, VancouverBlond color, slightly hazy. Light aroma of vegetables. Dry mouthfeel, some hay and malt flavor, robust bitterness for the style, but without the overall elegance expected from a Kölsch, so the result is pretty boring.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
234,"2015-12-24",3.6,"On tap at bier thirty. pours out a golden topped with a white head. nose is grain malts a little early grass hops. Taste is more of the grassy hops a nice grain malt to keep it together. A easy drinker and very enjoyable.","Boise, Idaho, USA","BuckeyeBoy"
234,"2015-12-24",3.5,"Draft at C Bar Portland. Bright gold, medium receding head. Strong initial sulfur and baking yeast smells mellow out to more benign straw and mango aromas. Utilitarian and balanced flavors of seltzer, quickbread, and mellow green herbs. Just a squidge more hop character could do wonders here.","Santa Rosa, California, USA","944play"
234,"2015-09-21",3.2,"Pours a finger of head on a hazy light straw body.
The aroma is honey and flowers, light but nice.
The taste has a solid bitterness, lemon mostly, followed by a lighter side.
The texture is crisp and fizzy.
The aroma is great.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"
234,"2015-08-22",3.9,"This was poured into a stange.
The appearance was a fairly clear golden orange color with a quickly dissipating head that dissipated fairly quickly. Lacing was few and far between.
The smell had some grainy/bready malts with a nice sweet grassy hop to it.
The taste had a nice sweet grainy/breadiness arranging around some light citrus characters. Lingering sweet bready aftertaste leads into the finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light on the body with a good sessionability about it. Carbonation runs fairly light and lets a nice smooth crisp sweetness on my tongue.
Overall, as a kolsch, it works. I cant find much fault with this one to style. A definite pleaser on the hot days.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
234,"2015-07-17",3.3,"Location: 12 oz can from Winooski Beverage, 7/17/15


Aroma: Aroma on the grainy side, some bread, pale malts, a bit of grassy hop, and some yeast

Appearance: Clear golden-orange color with a thin white head and strong, drippy lacing

Flavor: Malt forward, with some light pale malt sweetness, grassy bitterness, light spice

Palate: Light-medium body, drinks super easy, somewhat clean, and has average carbonation

Overall Impression: 
Solid enough, but it doesnt go beyond that for me. Not clean or flavorful enough to be a standout in the style.  I could see this being better super fresh, but I cant say what the age is on this can.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
234,"2015-06-18",3.5,"On tap at The Jupiter  Clear light golden, medium sized white head, good lacing. Aroma of cereal, hay and citrus. Flavor is bready, cereal, citrus and grainy

234,"2015-06-06",2.7,"Can from Medford TJs. Straw color with a slight hop aroma w/a thin white head. Bready, thin, crisp, overly hoppy flavor without the hallmark fruitiness found in a German Kolsch.I think this is brewed w/a neutral yeast vs. a Kolsch strain. Tastes much more like an American Blonde than a Kolsch.","","burleybrew"

234,"2015-04-08",3.7,"Slightly hazy golden with a thick white head. Lightly toasted malt with noticeable noble hops. Finishes with crisp and refreshing bitterness in the back of the throat.

234,"2015-02-16",3.3,"Tasty and smooth all round but it lacks the moreishness I love in a truly excellent Kolsch. It has a slick texture and quite lovely cereal flavors.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Alphadelic"
234,"2015-02-07",3.7,"Can (12 oz) bought @ Winooski Beverage Warehouse.

Appearance: Slightly hazy bright golden with a medium easy to revive white head and good lacing. 

Aroma: Not extremely hoppy, but still a tad too much for the style. Fresh cereals, herbal notes, citrus and biscuity notes.

Taste: Light to moderate sweetness, fresh cereals, herbal presence and decent malt backbone.

Palate: Light body. Medium carbonation. Clean. Crisp. Mild herbal finish. 

Overall: Good american version of a Kölsch. Despite the hops, its still not too far from the style. Quite tasty, drinkable and quenching. Good!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

234,"2014-12-26",3.6,"12 oz can poured. pours a cloudy golden color with a patchy white head. The description says it best, sometimes you just want a light, crisp beer. Thats exactly what this one is. One thing I have noticed with these guys so far, is that its no problem putting down a six pack of their stuff in a day, and this beer is no exception. Mild, wet, straw like aroma. Really easy grainy, straw flavors with a hint of citrus on the palate. I dont know. I like it. Another good one from these guys.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"

234,"2014-09-11",3.6,"Can at home in Salisbury, CT - picked up in VT. Pours perfectly clear yellow with a creamy, white head. The nose has some interesting melon and tangerine notes (atypical for a kolsch) along with background cereal. Light-medium sweet flavor with simple, lightly sugary white bread, cereal, faint bitter straw, a bit of citrusy tang. Light bodied with fine to average carbonation. Nicely balanced to finish, with some further cereal sweetness, straw, white bread, lemon rind. Basic but solid for the style.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

234,"2014-05-07",3.6,"Can. Pours a mostly clear golden color with a moderate white head on there. Nose is nice and crisp, with some grains coming through and just a hint of citrus to it. Taste is also very light and crisp, with just a hint of sweetness up front complemented with a hint of some subtle crisp sourness from the citrus. Really pleasant for the style.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"
234,"2014-04-15",3.3,"Can, a clear deep gold pour with a good half inch of foam that lingers and leaves lacing. Looks good. The nose is malty but with a substantial amount of fruitiness to it that gives me a graham & peach quality. The beers fairly light bodied with bit of a slick mouthfeel. The taste is kind of perfumey floral hops, grassy malts and a bitter bite near the end. Decent enough.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
234,"2014-02-24",3.3,"Can from The Bier Stein in Eugene. Grassy nose with some heavy bready notes and honey. Very light straw color, persistent carb, and a good head.

234,"2014-01-23",3.0,"On tap at St Augustines, pours a clear pale golden with a small beige head. Aroma is clean, bringing out notes of straw and grains. Flavour is clean and crisp enough, with notes of biscuity malt and grains. Pretty smooth-drinking kolsch, but as is typical for the style, nothing overly exciting. Well-executed nonetheless.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
234,"2014-01-13",2.9,"Slight head very yellow pour. Aroma of grain, eggs, skunk hops. Mid palate, less carb than it looks. Watery/dry with a slightly bitter finish not oversweet like many kolschs. Tastes of slight orange, wheat, bitter.","Seattle, Alabama, USA","nealblind"

Clear corn oil golden beer with a small white head..great lace.
Has a pleasing honey/nut aroma, some bread notes no real hop presence.
Very smooth yet low bitterness in the taste department, getting the barest touch of hop., touch o honey in the end..nice.
Very nice palate for such a low alcohol beer..not particularly well carbonated but goes down a treat.
Very drinkable beer..surely a high summer camping pick!","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"

234,"2013-11-27",3.8,"Solid kolsch. Light and crisp on the palate, but it has some surprisingly assertive flavors, especially for a 4.5-percent beer. Bready, cracker-like malt flavors. Mild, honey-like sweetness. Slightly fruity and tangy tartness. Hop bitterness is on the bold side, stylistically speaking, but I enjoyed it. Aromas of hay, grass and herbs in the background.
