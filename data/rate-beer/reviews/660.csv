660,"2010-02-15",4.1,"[Growler] from the brewery. Pours clear deep mahogany with a finger of khaki bubbles. Aroma is nice - dark fruits, plenty of caramel, light peat, and a hint of peppery alcohol. Mouthfeel is really nice and rich, super smooth, moderately sweet. There is more earthiness in the flavor than the aroma, and the fruitiness takes a bit of a backseat. Slightly oxidized, but the growler is a couple weeks old, so not too surprising, but it adds a nice touch of depth. Finish is lightly bitter and a touch astringent. Really nice wee heavy, definitely worth the ratings.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","MatSciGuy"

660,"2009-11-02",4.2,"On tap, 10oz pour into a Tulip Glass.

Dark red, no head or lacing at all. Fantastic color but lack of head lowers the score.

Aroma of peat, noticeable alcohol, malts, slight spiciness that seems almost Belgian.

Peat smoked malts, alcohol taste that increases as it warms. Pepper or clove (once again, Belgian-like). Towards the end of the glass, it really started to remind me of a Scotch Whisky.

Very low carbonation, thick, warming.

Very good late night sipping beer. The high alcohol (both in taste and in actuality) limits having another.

Overall, this really reminds me of their Hope and King Scotch Ale, just with much higher alcohol and a stronger peat presence.","Minnesota, USA","bsp77"

660,"2007-12-01",3.3,"UPDATED: MAR 30, 2015 Original rating 12-1-07: 10 oz. pour at the brewpub, as I joined with others from the Twin Cities crew during joets visit on 11-30-07. The aroma, which is not as strong as I hoped, features raisin and chocolate scents. Classic sweet barley wine aroma for the most part. Chalky, dry must smell that is not as unpleasant as it sounds but not particularly impressive either. Brown in color with an amber hue and a small amount of creamy, cream-colored head. Malt weetness and peat smoke smack the imbiber in the tongue on the first sip. Brown sugar, bourbon, and sweet corn from the malts. Lemon and tobacco dryness from the peat smoke. Dry, Scotch-like finish. Burnt grain / charred oak aftertaste. Heavy body. Smooth and oily in the palate. Tastes like a beer version of a peated bourbon (yes, bourbon, not Scotch, due to the heavy-bodied sweetness) or a lightly smoked barley wine. Town Hall Wee Heavy is unusual and unbalanced. Its also a bit cartoonish; it seems like a mockery or an exaggerated simplistic interpretation of the wee heavy style rather than something authentic. Im glad I tried it, but I must admit that I came away disappointed. 7/3/7/4/14. Updated rating 3-30-15: 5 oz. pour, on tap at the brewpub in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  Consumed on 3-28-15.  Pours an amber-tinted, maroon-like dark brown. Clear liquid. Long-lasting beige head. Looks good.  Bubblegum, plum, and golden raisin scents.  Pleasant enough but weak smell.  Flavors of plum with pit and prune juice. Toasted, borderline roasted, malt taste. Not offensive but not my favorite set of flavors. Dry and fruity finish.  Medium body.  Smooth in the palate.  Okay overall but not my kind of beer. 6/4/6/3/12. Combined rating 7/3/7/3/13.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Full bodied, creamy mouthfeel.  Sweet brown sugar flavors saturated with caramel and smoke.  Charred dark fruits and notes of mild chocolate come through as well.

Still pours a dark ruddy brown without much foam and no lacing, I think the aroma is milder than with the tap version. I taste a moderate caramel malt, with a nice smoky peat character as well. There is a little bit of molasses and a generous sweet vanilla flavor in there too. I dont notice any fruit or the alcohol bite this time.

Looks fierce. Peat is plentiful in a complex and straightforward aroma, along with wet grass, white chocolates, smoked malts, raisins, cherries and caramel. A ton of personality is bursting out as the libation warms. Flavor is in peak form and has more of the same elements. Smoke is lighter while peat and sweet dark fruit are noticeably thickened by a warming conglomeration and melding of flavors. The smokey malt is warming on an exceptionally creamy and full palate. This never feels thin or unexciting, an excellent and easy quaff. Finishes with dry smoke and spiciness, semi-sweet and lingering for an eternity, or until I caress my palate with more. Alcohol is barely noticeable. Excellent rendition, incredibly true to the style. There is just no way this could be mistaken for another style. I cant wait to have more.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Flavor is a surprisingly dry, smokey preserved fruit, with a lot of aromatic malt character. Theres a certain smokiness that jumps out at me right off the bat, but its ethereal and clean, as if from a luxury cigarette or something. A little woodsy and touch of peat. At first, Im really down about this beer. It seems too dry, too one dimensional. But, as I drink it grows on me. Im used the the coarse grainy sugars of the style, with a lot of residual caramelly sweetness. Instead, I have this really drinkable, refined beverage with all the subtle, yet unique and definable characters, that take time to grow on me. Gentle vinous notes ebb from the tide and leave a grapeskin and strawberry residue. Faint chocolate-mint character grows.  It took me a while to realize what a good beer this is. A lilting song of gentle warming smoke, dispersive sweet caramels and light husky phenols carol along in the night, with phenomenal drinkability and true uniqueness. Towards the end, the number closes with a cusp of minty dryness, for that longing hop balance. Nicely attenuated and any aging really melds this beer into a beauty.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

660,"2007-01-22",4.3,"Hand bottle courtesy of footbalm: Pours a barely transparent dark mahogany with a thin, froth of spotty-lacing tan head.  Aroma boasts lots of sweet caramel malt, nice peat and complex dark fruity notes.  Body starts with a full , sweet dark caramely maltiness with notes of butterscotch, dates, and dark cherries.  Finishes lighter in body and smooth, hiding the alcohol very well.  Great complexity and a unique brew, thanks Eric!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"

Aroma of peat, smoke, caramel, toffee, and a touch of cherry.  Flavor is big caramel malts, some smoke, slight chocolate, some cherry, and brief hops on the finish. Smooth and malty throughout.  Good full body with a warm finish.  A well done Scotch ale for sure..","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"
660,"2007-01-22",4.2,"12oz bottle, courtesy of hopscotch.  Thanks, Eric!  Pours a dark, dark cherry-cola appearance; light tan head with decent retention.  An excess of dried fruits, caramel, and butterscotch: awesome aroma.  Full, viscous mouthfeel: plenty of caramel, toffee, dried fruits, and roasted malts.  Ends in a long, sweet butterscotch and toffee finish.  Excellent.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

660,"2007-01-21",4.0,"Looked like Cherry Coca-cola in the glass.  The aroma was very malty and berry sweet.  Taste included the malt and berries but also with caramel and hops.

660,"2007-01-20",4.5,"A bullwinklian thanks to footbalm for this beer. Its malty, sweet, and it has almost an essence of strawberries to it. It was great. I really liked it. (hint if you want PP or lost abbey, this beer is trade bait).","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
660,"2007-01-20",4.3,"12 ounce handbottled sample from who else?  footbalm the king of Minnesota handbottlers-traders extraordinaire, sampled at roughly cellar temperature from a Dieu du Ciel! glass.  First I have a couple of confessions:  1) Ive been spurning trade offers, and not seeking any out myself for a while because Im too lazy, too disorganized, and have too much damn beer to drink already and 2) Ive always been a bit suspicious of the ""hand-bottled"" trades making the rounds....though Ill admit to having tried a couple, Ive never sought one out.  But this was Town Hall, a brewery I like a lot, from Minnesota, where I hope to live soon; this was a Scotch Ale, my favorite style and in fact the third-highest rated example (and I still want BA Alesmith WH bitches); and this was Footbalm, a wonderful gent if my hour or so spent with him is any indication, and a genius trader.  So I couldnt turn it down.  Thanks Eric!  Now on to the review:

A tiny bit of fizz as I pop the cap, good sign.....it pours translucent/near opaque dark chestnut-to-maple, with a smallish but lasting off-white head that slowly dies into a thickish lasting ring....the aroma is truly gorgeous, stunning, something I dream about:  gingerbread and maple and light smoky-peaty malts, molasses and raisins and a touch of whisky, just exactly what I want in a Scotch ale, deep and rich and decadent and oh I can only imagine what this is like in absolutely pristine condition....the velvety body belies the circumstances of a thousand mile journey and unplanned-for bottling and decanting, velvety-soft and again decadently rich and thick, with upfront port-wine sweetness mellowed by very bitter chocolate and heathery-peaty earthiness....at first I thought the roastiness a bit overdone, too charred and bitter it seemed, but after a couple of minutes it softens enough to become truly enjoyable, although there is a very faint flatness and chalkiness at the finish thats a slight detraction -- but only slight.  The more it warms, the more dried fruits and lightly sour cherry-wine notes show up; the complexity is wonderful, but the drinkability remains high.  I had expected this to be good, but it blows me away; one of the best few Ive had in the style and my new favorite from Town Hall.  Thanks again so much Eric!","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
660,"2007-01-19",4.1,"Handbottled courtesy of the amazing footbalm!  Poured a translucent, ruby-tinted deep brown with a light swirl of cinnamon head to cap it off.  Nose was a fascinating blend of smoked peat and charred dark fruits... slow-building molasses, apple peel, and a candy-like sweetness.  The flavor was complex almost to the point of being daunting... smoked chocolate and caramel give a first impression backed by sweet dark fruits and rather heavy peat... left a sticky molasses feel on the lips.  Heavier on the palate with some sharper boozy notes at the roof of the mouth.  Excellent brew!  Thanks Eric!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

660,"2007-01-16",3.9,"Chocolatey brown in color with some whiskey shaded tint at the bottom.  Aroma is like a chocolate covered clementine with a bit of scotchy booze underneath.  Tastes of apple peel, caramel, chardonnay-like bright fruits.  Deeply warming and almost too smug with sweetness.  But not quite.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

660,"2007-01-10",4.1,"Tap at the brew pub. Rich murky brownish brew with a ring of fine bubbles. Nose is heavy,hehehehe, with what almost seems like peat moss that is very close to a date plantation. A very nice brew indeed.Oh no, not a ort-like finish. Shit.","Western Minneapolis Suburbs, Minnesota, USA","footbalm"

This is very good.  Lives up to the hype its received.  Normally Im not a huge fan of scotch ales, but this one is exceptional for the style.  Someday, I will have to get my hands on the Alesmith version, to see how that stacks up.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"

Rich Malt and Raisin/Prune Notes..Wonderfully Balanced and Rich with a Nice Warming Effect.  Strong, Sturdy and Very Likeable.

660,"2005-02-08",4.1,"Cask at the brewpub.  Aroma of rich, sweet caramel and cinnamon.  The mouthfeel on this is divine and on cask there is no waiting for the warm up for the flavors to burst out.  It is one of the sweetest beers Ive tasted that does not become cloying.  The alcohol plays nicely to add a vaporous dimension of complexity to the candied malt.  Very easy to drink.","Mt Kisco, New York, USA","Brewso"
660,"2005-02-07",3.6,"Another growler from Phil.  Thanks.  This poured a nice deep dark chestnut brown with a frothy tan head.  Nose held hints of fruit, malt sweetness, caramel, molasses.  Good robust body and smooth feel on the palate.  The flavor was hints of dried fruit, malt, some spirits (bourbon? Scotch?), a little sweetness.  Very rewarding.  Good stuff.","Urbana, Illinois, USA","YourDarkLord"
660,"2005-02-05",4.1,"To be fair, the first glass of this I had was not too hot, but the next one from a growler and most recently on cask... oh damn!  Deep red color with a thin head.  Sweet malt aroma, but nothing too distinctive.  Pourful flavor of whisky, smoke and malt compounded with what I believe to be raisins and possibly dates.  Oh my crikey is this good stuff.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
660,"2005-01-30",4.4,"Perhaps the best beer Town Hall has made.  Light fruit aromas with malt, and a sweet aroma as well.  Very dark, almost black with no head.  Great flavor with much complexity.  It had some flavors of a Baltic porter and a pleasant lager taste.  More heavy fruit and sugar in the taste.  It seems like a beer one should sip, but it is so smooth it is easy to drink a lot of this.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
660,"2005-01-26",4.0,"On-Tap at the brewpub: 10 oz serving - 
Mega thick super dark brown with purpley edges and a loosely thinned off-white cap that just kinda murks around the edges. Glaring spotty lace eluding to the big malts used in this sucker.

Aroma is a whole melange of dark fruits dipped in caramel and molasses. Its not all the strong but it is one big medley of molasses, red apple, raisin, fig, and pruney stuff. Nice little lacing of good Ol alcohol whisps around at the nose hairs after each wiff.

Flavors are hardly any different then what youd expect after the aroma. Solid dark fruit and molasses tones with a darker caramel eluding around the corners. Sweet, soft, chewy, full, but nearly overly sweet too. It kinda balances out with a moderate, well placed, smokey peat and slight heat added in near the finish. It almost comes across as a big mess of malts but somehow it comes together to perform a song and dance across, and, all over the palate. Im thinking its like planned chaos for the mouth. Strangely good though.

The full, almost sticky body is quite nice. It really sits there a good while with a soft gentle yield of malty sweetness.

Another fine drinker by Hoops; it packs a bit of punch, although its barely noticeable, only later once the warmth starts hitting your head a little(even with the 10oz - which wasnt nearly enough, cuz it was gone in no time).","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"
660,"2005-01-23",3.7,"I was less overwhelmed by this brew compared to my fellow Minnesota compariots. Dont get me wrong, I thought it was very good, but perhaps not my favorite style. Like the commercial description says, ""while extremely sweet at first...,"" I thought it was overly sweet. And since I only had  a 3 oz sample, I didnt get to see if it mellowed later on. If this is still available on my next visit to TH, Ill give it another ride. Faint aroma, although I was battling a cold which may have affected my olfactory abilities. Very sweet and a solid alchohol profile.","Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA","ElGaucho"
660,"2005-01-23",4.7,"This was great, I mean really good. Awesome sweet taste filled with chocolate and toffee. It looks awesome with a terrific head. An inviting aroma begs you to drink this one.

660,"2005-01-23",4.7,"Caramel, candy, gritty roasty chocolate, and dark dark bagpipe-blowing goodness.  I thought this tasted like good candy, and thus have difficulty being objective about it as a beer.  I want to give it a five, but I feel that my sweet tooth is taking over.  I want to pour this on my cereal, and lick it out of my fiancees belly button.  I like it.

660,"2005-01-20",5.0,"For the style, I cant imagine what they could have done to improve it. Port, currants, raisins, a little cognac and good hefty body. The PERFECT January sipper.

Well, there you go, a perfect score. If they put it on cask, Ill wet myself, then give it a 6...in that order.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","BitterPoet"
660,"2005-01-20",4.4,"Dark plummy color, with cherry edges. largely opaque, with a thinnish, though durable tan head atop.
Roasty, bittersweet espresso in the aroma, quickly eclipsed by molasses and dates, a rich, sweetness,sticky, sappy (not in the sense of being maudlin or trite, but being like the leaking of a maple tree), and nearly indulgent, ...avoids resembling treacle, comes off sophisticated and very inviting.
The indulgence begins for real in the flavor, dark chocolate and toffee tones are felt foremost, carob, molasses, very full on the tongue, and tangy. This one washes luxuriously, almost sloppily around the mouth, but its a so delightfully pungent in taste, I take pleasure in the mess. The 8.5% abv shines a little half-way into the glass, but doesnt stick out too clumsily. The warming attributes are well-appreciated,and expertly timed. (Mid-January in Minneapolis...it gets a little cold, you know.) Whiskey tastes come to mind, a little cognac, but the real flavor is a cross between dark Jamaican rum and port wine.
This is so tasty...so very nice...there, Ive run out of things to say, and will simply state the obvious.
Due to its strength, this one is being served only in 10 ounce portions at the pub, yet here I sit at home with a whole growler to myself...how much damage can I do?
Just kidding, Ill cap the thing and dole out its goodness to stave off the chill and serve as reward for any accidental good I might do in the day.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"
