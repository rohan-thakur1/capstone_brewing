3393,"2015-01-26",4.1,"The beer is reddish brown in color. Small off white head. Big raspberry aroma. Mild funk and lemons. A little bit of vinegar. Medium tart. Big on raspberries. Some oak. Some stone fruit. A little stronger than Id like.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
3393,"2014-11-27",4.2,"A - the pour is a nice rosy copper mahogany with a small ring of off white head. S - the raspberries (both seedy and underripe and jammy) lead the way. Nice combo of an earthy, oaky, tannins, leathery, black cherries and currents red wine. Notes of red wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar and acrid sharp lemony notes. M - sour up front to a malt heavy full body. End is a quick sharp stinging vinegar to a sweet dry end. T - nice combo of framboise and sour brown. Seedy underripe raspberries and sweet jammy notes lead the taste. Palate is earthy buttery oaky tannin-y leathery tobacco currents black cherries red wine followed by vinegar and malts. Balsamic and ride wine vinegar blend with darker malty palate. End has a short sharp lemony acidity to assert dry fruitiness. O - super complex and probably the best sour brown I've had. An interesting departure from santes norm. A little less on the brown and acidity would have ruffled my skirt a little more, but I'm being picky because this is an great beer that I have to struggle to find fault. Not my favorite style but still spot on. 4.2","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
3393,"2014-10-16",4.7,"750ml bottle, reviewed from notes (5/31/14 and 9/7/14). Aroma is dominated by raspberry and blackberry jam with some kind of funky red-wine-vinous-oak tannin. There is an obvious malt presence to the tune of dark caramel and toasted bread as ineedbeer pointed out. The beer pours deep mahogany with big white head that turns into a ring and some carbonation spots on top of the liquid. Taste is up front sour raspberry, with faint caramel. The jam sweetness takes over mid-palate and really brings out ripe berries and light lemon/citrus. The body is medium-full with medium carbonation and a semi-dry, sour finish. After taste is seedy berry, bread crusts and oak spice. The beauty behind this beer is how jammy and sour it is without bringing out the syrup texture, or vinegar/acetic quality some misguided sours tend to have. Even with 3 months age on the bottle after first exposure the raspberry jam quality still held up, but with a more complex funk character. Beautiful beer. Perhaps my favorite Sante Adairius sour to date - which means I have to rate it higher than West Ashley.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
3393,"2014-10-12",4.2,"Aroma is rather fruity with quite a bit of raspberry character. Some light malt notes of caramel and toasted bread. Low acidity in the aroma. Some cherry and other berry notes. Pours a cloudy, burnt amber brown with a small, moderately thick, tan head with decent retention. Small lacing and faint legs. Flavor is very acidic with some nice berry, cherry and cassis notes. Light citrus notes and a touch of acetic character. Medium light bitterness and light oak notes. Light malt notes of toasted bread and dark caramel with faint chocolate. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol alcohol warmth. Overall, a pretty nice fruited sour beer. Lots of fruit notes in the aroma and decent notes in the flavor. Acidity is high but not over the top.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3393,"2014-09-29",4.3,"My 100th Sante rating! What a ludicrous array of sublime beers it has been. This is no exception, with the aroma bursting right out of the bottleneck. The purplish amber liquid emanates the essence of wild black raspberries and Concord grapes with a jammy end. Flavor emphasizes the raspberry, with the acidic bite of unripe Himalayan blackberries. Quite sour, mostly lactic plus a lemon juice intensity on the finish. All throughout, theres an understated malt note, like an unsweetened chocolate cake donut. Totally great!","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
3393,"2014-09-07",4.3,"Bottle, shared among friends, thanks! Pours cloudy reddish chestnut with a small tan head that dissipates quickly leaving good lacing. Aroma is very raspberry jammy, some faint funky notes, a bit of dark sugar, oak tannins. Flavor is kinda sweet and just a bit tart, lots and lots of raspberry in this one, jammy and yummy with a malty backbone with toffee and other dark sugars. A bit of funk for complexity, and definite vinous barrel notes present as well. Medium plus, creamy body. Very very good.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
