2906,"2016-07-03",3.8,"Draft at Arsenal Cider House in Pittsburgh. The sign says semi-sweet and thats exactly right. For a cider this is pretty good, not too sweet, dry and simple without any excess. High priced at $8 for a small plastic glass but I guess thats the norm these inflationary days.","Pennsylvania, USA","MarkSachon"
