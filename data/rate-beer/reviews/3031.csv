Palate...robust, taught and broad shouldered with great sweetness and dry, tannic oakiness. This one fumes with deep, dark dried fruits and heavy doses of whiskey.

3031,"2016-03-20",4.3,"Many thanks to my friend Matt for this great brew! Cheers buddy! Brew 1000 - 999e rating. Ce nest pas une effronterie, je les évalue dans lordre où nous les avons bues et ça tombe comme ça. Je retrouve dans cette splendide bière tout et exactement tout ce que jaime dun barley wine. Liqude ambré qui pourrait facilement passer pour un scotch lorsquil coule du goulot à mon verre. Parfaitement translucide, aux reflets caramélisés et doux. Aucune mousse et ce ma convient parfaitement ainsi. Le liquide me confronte et je suis entièrement à sa merci. Des arômes de caramel, de fruits noirs et de fleur doranger. Des arômes qui me rappellent quelque peu les pâtisseries libanaises - le baklava par exemple. Un douce liqueur me coule en bouche transportant avec lui des saveurs en accord avec les arômes. Je suis ici plutôt du côté des fruits noirs et encore une fois du caramel. Un gâteau au fruits au Cognac, sans les habituelles épices de Noël quon retrouve dans ce type de gâteau. Une texture amincie par la barrique dont la présence est évidente. Un pur délice qui coupe parfaitement entre les bières sûres et acidulées!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
3031,"2016-03-17",4.5,"RBWG16. Who brought this garbage? The bottle pours with a brown body that supports a light tan head. The aroma offers up all kinds of drool inducing caramel goodness, molasses and then slick sweet smelling malty yum. Oh yeah, this will do. Yes. The taste is similar with nectar sweet malts that have a slightly ripe cherry sensation in the background. There are loads of tasty residual sugars going on here that are caramel and molasses and a dash of toffee every now and then. This is working oh so well. Wow! Solid sipper that is at its peak right now. Oh my!","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

3031,"2016-02-22",4.8,"Rating #1,600. From notes. Enjoyed at the 3rd Annual Barleywine Tasting at Traviss house. 22 oz bottle. Arguably, this was the best of the night. The pour is a dark, dark brown with a little garnet shining into it. There is a thin darker tan head that falls to a collar leaving no lace at all. This one looks heavy. The aroma is really freaking good. There is a lot of dark fruits right up front to lead into a light vanilla and sweet brown sugar offering. There is a little caramel and a solid ring of bourbon. I think the only thing I could knock it on is that there is too much bourbon for the balance. The flavor is amazing. So layered and complex. There is a bourbon and vanilla up front, moving to a sweet sugar and dark fruits. There is a little light cherry mixed in as well. The mouth feel is awesome. Heavy and chewy with a soft, velvety carbonation, and a lingeringly sweet, vanilla bourbon finish. I wish this wasnt so hard to get. This thing is an absolute gem!","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
3031,"2016-02-18",4.2,"22, capped and waxed. Thank you so much, G, and happy 23 my man! Appreciate you sharing your presents. Pours a murky and very dark brown with a thin and creamy light tan head that fades pretty quickly. Big sweet nose, lots of molasses and nougat and vanilla and caramel. Thick heavy body with minimal carb. Nougat, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, molasses mid palate. Long sweet finish. Yeah, in a sense, its just another big BA BW that tastes like an excellent melted candy bar, but this one is really good-balanced, layered, approachable. Not at all refreshing, but very complex and interesting.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"

3031,"2016-01-28",4.2,"On tap @ Toronado Seattle. Stoked to finally try this! Pours thick oily brownish black with very thin oily mocha head. Aroma is big syrupy sweet roasty dark malt; tons of flavor here - notes of toffee, molasses, vanilla, bourbon. Taste is sticky sweet dark caramel malt; loads of vanilla, caramel, oaky barrel notes, molasses, sweet bourbon. Big abv is well hidden here, although the immense sweetness lets you known this is no average beer. Opens up a bit as it warms. Quite sweet and barrel-ly for a barleywine, which is a good thing. Flavor profile is similar to both B-bomb and KDS, I expected this to be considerably more bitter. Impressive brew. Honestly not much of a barleywine fan myself, but this is super approachable with huge flavors.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"

P: Syrupy with some bubbles and medium to heavy mouthfeel. O: This blew me away on the first sip. It does lean to the sweet side, but its not overly so.

3031,"2015-10-15",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 22, 2016 This may be the most astounding barleywine Ive ever tasted. A plethora of winy, red fruit skins, smooth bourbon, port/sherry, chocolate, prunes, molasses, raisins, vanilla, pecan pralines, rum balls, tobacco, toasted coconut and old leather. All these esters are rich, deep and very intense, while, simultaneously coating the palate in a gentle and refined way.
