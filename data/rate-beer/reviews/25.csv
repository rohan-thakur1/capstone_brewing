25,"2016-03-03",4.2,"BOD 2/12/16. Clear golden pour. Outstanding head volume, very good retention and outstanding lacing.

Outstanding nose of light lemon, a bit of zest, a hint of spice and a nice cracker biscuit base.

Light medium body that is smooth with a touch of oily slickness. World class carbonation with a burst of effervescence in the middle and a strong finely bubbled prickly punch in the finish.

The flavor profile is almost quite outstanding, but it lacks a bit of complexity. It begins with a burst of hop flavor that is mostly lemon with tropical notes (mango, passion fruit) underneath. The mild rind oriented bitterness in the middle is expertly balanced by a rising sweetness that makes the tropicals pop. As the sweetness ebbs, grainy wheat and biscuit are noted and provide a nice crispness. The finish is a slow fade of slightly sweet rind with impressive citrus notes.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

4.0 A: Clear golden yellow color. Two fingers of pillowy white head. Retention is very good and a finger of lacing is left.

4.5 S: This smells amazing. Fresh, resiny hoppiness smashes your senses. It really does smell like there are actual hops in the glass. Big citrus featuring lemon and lime. Neutral wheat and maybe the slightest touch of cat piss. Dank and stanky the way it should be. The only things missing are the wheat ale flavors. Theres nothing in terms of spiciness, banana, or bubblegum. Well, maybe there is, but its impossible to detect through the hops.

3.5 T: The taste is markedly less hoppy than the nose, but theres still quite a bit in there. Mild to moderate bitterness, citrusy lemon and grassy hoppiness. Neutral wheat with perhaps a touch peachy fruitiness. Its good, but neither the malts or hops are really impressive. 

3.5 M: Lighter medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Lacking some of the creamy chewiness that tends to come with wheat brews. The filtering of this brew may not have done it any favors.

3.5 D: Very strong start, but ultimately came up short where it counts. Its still a fine brew and the nose is amazing enough to revisit again and again.

25,"2015-11-27",4.0,"On draft at Three Floyds after the Bourbon County debacle in Chicago. The pour is a crystal clear gold color with a nice thin white head and a couple spots of lace as it falls to a nice collar. The aroma is really good. There is a nice floral hop dominance that really takes this up a notch. No wheat is present, and I'm okay with that. There is a nice citrus that carries itself out to the back end. The flavor is pretty good as well. There is a light citrus that lends itself throughout the flavor and a nice grassiness kind of takes over. The wheat does poke through on the back end and it takes a little away, but it is a wheat ale. The mouth feel is nice and well carbonated with a lingeringly light bitterness and a little wheat. It's good.

25,"2015-04-27",4.6,"First of all, let me preface this review by saying that this is hands down my favorite beer of all time, so Im a little biased. Ive been drinking it off and on for at least 8 years. This is the first bottle Ive been able to get my hands on for a year or two, so Im pretty excited. Bottle into my Spiegelau IPA glass. Big pillowy white head that leaves lots of lacing. Wheat malt is evident in the nose, fresh lemon zest, a little cut grass, a touch of citrus hops. Taste is magical. Its soft wheat, a bit of pale/bready malt, more juicy/ lemony hop, touch of bubblegum, finishes slightly sweet and slightly bitter, with just a touch of resin really late. Carbonation is medium, super smooth, light to medium body and soft mouthfeel. Not a hop monster, just a wonderful symphony of flavors.

The flavor is just as awesome as the aroma. There is more malt than I was expecting but it perfectly compliments the juiciness from the hops.

25,"2014-10-25",3.5,"Poured from bottle into a pint glass
 Appearance  The beer pours a clear orange-amber color with a nice two finger head of pure white foam. The foam fades slowly over time to leave a fantastic level of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.
 Smell  The aroma of the beer is heaviest of a wheaty smell mixed with a rather strong grapefruit and lemon smell. Along with these aromas are some light grassy aromas and a bit of grain as well.
 Taste- The taste begins very light and crisp with some wheat flavors mixed with a cracker base flavor as well as some tastes of a herbal hop upfront, which are rather light. As the taste advances a bit of a lemon and grapefruit hop flavor start developing on the tongue with them gaining strength as the taste advances further. In the end, the lighter wheat and cracker tastes grow just a bit stronger and join the hop and a little bit of grain to leave a rather crisp flavor to linger on the tongue.
 Mouthfeel  The body of the brew is quite light with a carbonation level that is rather average. For the mild flavors of the brew the thinner body creates a rather crisp brew overall, matching well the drier and lighter flavors nicely.
 Overall  Definitely not really a flavor powerhouse here, but really instead, a quite crisp and refreshing tasting brew. It has just enough herbal and grassy hop to give it life, but not too much to keep it from being refreshing.","","Darkmagus82"

Taste is hop-forward -- citrus, pine, with a light body, wheat that comes through more as it warms. Easy drinking, light body, heavily hop-forward. Doesnt really have a prominent wheat character. I imagine this is one of those beers that redefined styles a few years back -- very forward thinking and progressive, making an ipa wheat beer. As an IPA, its okay. As a wheat beer, its hard to even recognize it. As a pioneer, this could be an earth-shattering revelation.

25,"2014-02-18",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 14, 2014 Editing original rating. Last two batches of this that I have got have tasted and smelled different.

This was my first taste of Three Floyds beers over a year ago. Ive since been able to try five of their beers total and this is still one of my favorites. Its difficult to get ahold of their beers since Im in NY, but Ive gotten what I could. Its an amazing wheat beer with a summer feel, but Id drink it year round if I had the access. The aroma is incredible and the hops smell is of citrus and grass. Appearance is golden with some bubbles that come up the glass and a minimal head.

25,"2014-01-25",3.8,"Reviewed from notes. Picked up a sixpack as I drove through Indiana on my way out to Alaska last summer.
She pours a nice bright yet clear golden color and leaves the same colored body, however, its slightly hazy here and there, streams of carbonation are rising at a moderate pace, a one finger white foamy head lasts for about a minute before dieing, some moderate sticky lacing.
The smell has the hops up front, slightly citrusy, slightly grassy, and the wheat is very subdued.
The taste has a balanced sweet fruity grassy citrusy hops, wheat is once again very subdued, slight malty aftertaste, crisp dry finish.
The palate is about a light to medium, semi-sessionable. Carbonation is actually a lot smoother than most APWAs Ive had, actually, I would say this is quite impressive for me and for the style.
Overall, Ive had a fair amount of APWAs over the years, and I would say this is probably the smoothest one anyone could ever find; I would have this again, even though its a hoppier version of the style.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

Poured to NB globe.

A: Brass ale pours to single finger, bone white head which dissipates into blanket of fine bubbles. Near excellent clarity. Confluent columns of bubbles rise from the bottom. 

S: Lots of grapefruit, cotton candy, other citrus. Light, very light, resin. Light hint of grain and corn.

T: I cant recall having a wheat ale which actually accentuated the flavor of the wheat so well. Slightly sour, yeasty flavor, plenty of citrus rinds. Effervescent finish highlights the hops in the beer. 

M: light, yet tacky. High carbonation. Numbing and dry mouthfeel. 

D: Quite a drinkable beer. I wish it were hotter out, it would pair well with a warm day.

Gumballhead a little grapefruity nose. 80-Acre has a sweet nose. 
Gumballhead is a little piney and citrusy, with a hoppy bitter, dry finish that lingers. Medium carbonation. Gumballhead leaves a bigger, longer feel in the mouth. 
80-Acre is almost a light saison sweetness, followed by a little hoppy kick that then turns back to sweet for the finish. 
80-Acre is good, but Gumballhead remains my favorite!

Appearance: The body is crystal clear with an amber hue, a dense white head accompanies it for a moment before settling into a creamy coating.
Aroma: The aroma is slightly floral with orange and grapefruit with a mild sweetness of cotton candy.

Palate: Full-bodied and highly carbonated.

The beer is a light golden coppery color, allows light through fairly freely, and has a good amount of carbonation. The aroma is similar to that of an IPA, hoppy, citrusy, but with a sweeter fruity smell you typically dont get. The taste is extremely balanced; I change my mind as to whether its more sweet or bitter with each sip. I suppose its slightly hop forward however. Grapefruit, orange, and a light hint of caramel when the sweetness peaks. Light-medium body, eminently drinkable, and it leaves thick walls of lacing behind. Thoroughly enjoyable beer.","","Aurora21"

Light to medium body with a creamy, juicy entry, hugely blanketing moderate strength and fairly sharp carbonation and aforementioned acidic hop bite, fits the awesome fruity flavor profile extremely well.

Scent rocks. Such a tropical aroma, wonderfully accentuated by light green budding flowers.  Exciting scent that I cant say Ive encountered elsewhere.

Taste is also pretty unique; wonderful would be an understatement. Not generally a fan of wheat beers because of the sweetness and the unencumbered esters. There is practically nothing about the flavor of this beer that bothers me, which surprises me with a wheat.  Crisp and even lemony!

Mouthfeel is very mellow without abandoning any desired presence. Doesnt leave any lingering cotton on the sides of the tongue that less refined wheat beers seem to do. (I realize many wheat beer fans might not want the style so clean - but I personally prefer this approach.)

Smell: Just an awesome nose on this one. You get some wheat characteristics, but there are plenty of hops of the grapefruit variety.

Taste/feel: Its likely just because of the name, and I know Im drinking it, but I honestly feel like I get some bubblegum flavors out of this beer -- theres a lot of fruity hops at the front of the tongue, and then the wheat comes through on the finish. Maybe that bubblegum flavor is just the peach coming through, but I can pretend what I want! Anyway, just an awesomely refreshing beer without much bitterness.

It's a lite weight wheat beer. Not much cloudiness or thickness, but does retain the citrusy sweetness and some spiciness of a model wheat beer plus it has just enough hop fire and bitterness to give it an edge. Very drinkable; if it were not for the alcohol content; I'd drink a whole six pack on my own. Smelling this is reminiscent of opening a bag of gumballs, though not in a sick way. Love this beer!

25,"2012-12-27",4.2,"Reviewed 10/30/2012. Thanks to Momar42 for the bottle, and double thanks for providing me with my first Three Floyds beer!! About 6 oz poured into a pint glass.

A: Pours a golden yellow color with nice clarity - something Im not used to in wheat ales. The head is a one finger eggshell shade with some nice lacing down the glass.

S: Fairly tropical, with that distinctive Amarillo hop aroma. Tea leaves, mango, papaya, and grapefruit all come across, but perhaps not quite as vividly as I hoped. Still, it smells like it will be up my alley...

T: Much like the aroma, its hoppy; but with the focus on tropical fruits, rather than pine/herbal notes. Its very citrusy to start (like I expect out of a good IPA), but the wheat that comes through in the mid-taste smooths things out like a baws. What catches me off guard is the subtle complexity featured, transitioning from slightly sweet to slightly bitter in different stages (and this isnt even a full bottle!) Not quite as drinkable as expected, but surprisingly joyous to savor.

M: Slightly heavy in its texture, which is my only real beef here. Its dry, crisp, and drinkable, which is what I want out of my hoppy beers, with the strong carbonation I expect out of a wheat beer.

O: I normally dont like plain wheat ales, unless theyre hoppy. This fits said criteria nicely, so its plain to see that I enjoy this a whole lot. This was my first from FFF, and needless to say, it lived up to the hype for me.

Pours lightly hazy golden amber with a nice white head that retains extremely well and leaves a lot of sticky rings of lacing behind.

Aroma is quite fruity and citrusy with lemon, orange and grapefruit as well as pineapple, peaches and some banana.  Somewhat floral as well as some notes of yeast and bread.  Very good strength.

25,"2012-04-08",3.7,"I received a 12oz bottle in trade with a friend (thanks, Joe!). I poured it into a wheat beer glass.

Appearance: Banana skin-yellow hue, almost glowing. Surprisingly clear for a bottle-conditioned brew. Forms an average-sized, bright white, foamy head which retains and laces well.

Smell: Fresh oranges dominate the nose due to the Amarillo hops. Not much of anything else, though.

Taste: Three Floyds classifies ""Gumballhead"" as being a wheat beer of some sort, which is odd because it has few qualities I would associate with a beer of the general style. This is much more in the line of an American pale ale than anything wheaty. From beginning to end its lemony, zesty (almost peppery), hop flavor and accompanying bitterness. Theres a tingle across the tongue throughout the entire swig, so its quite energetic for such a relatively small brew.  It ends with a quick hop bite, a hint of chalky aftertaste, and then slowly fades away cleanly.

Whats remarkable is that considering how hop-forward this is for the style (and in general), its very refreshing. This would be an ideal summer beer, but has enough flavor to satisfy in any situation. My only complaint would be that its a one-dimensional palate. Id prefer some more familiar qualities of a wheat beer instead of something bordering on a pale ale. 

Drinkability: According to Three Floyds website, Gumballhead is 5.5% ABV and 35 IBUs. I can definitely see the potency as this beer has a thicker, longer-lasting, and energetic palate than your average pale wheat ale. Although the 35 IBUs actually seems a little low as this seems to have as much hop presence as many pale ales and single IPAs Ive tried. A smaller, lighter body would enable it to be a true session beer, but for now its just a tasty, enjoyable pale wheat ale that Id happily buy if I could get it.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

25,"2012-02-28",3.8,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/1/2010.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

Out of the bottle comes a clear straw yellow liquid with a mellow 2 cm white head. The cap slowly regresses, leaving just a thin film and a bit of lace. Large fizzy bubbles form on the bottom of the glass and rise up to sustain the head.

Very mellow wheat, some lemon and orange, and a blast of citrus and slightly herbal hops.

Three Floyds does a great job of just obliterating the Pale Wheat Ale category. When designing it, they must have decided to make a nice, relaxed pale wheat and right at the end added a truck load of Amarillo. Awesome. Some soft honey-like sweetness with a touch of citrus seem to come from the malt, but a ton of pineapple, mango, grapefruit, and herbal hops blast through and take control. Finishes clean and somewhat bitter.

The light feel is not something I would really have an issue with for this style, except that with the huge hoppy character to this beer warrants a slightly bigger body. Overall it feels crisp on the tongue, with a bit of oily hop residue as a contrast.

This is a lot better than most of the boring beers in the category, and is a great light change of pace from a great Three Floyds lineup.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Hop forward aroma. Assertive tropical fruit backed by pleasant citrus and soft floral aroma. Wheat malt backs and balances the hops. Less of a grainy aroma than many American Pale Wheats, there is a rather pleasant sweetness.

The hops are allowed to take center stage upfront. Sweet pineapple flavor leads followed by subtle grapefruit and a general citrus sweetness. The bitterness is rather low, though there is enough to provide balance. Soft malt sweetness rounds out behind. The soft wheat provides a nearly perfect combination for the fruity hop flavor.

The bodied falls on the lighter side of medium. Fairly crisp carbonation. Moderate but refreshing finish.

Beautiful full gold with great clarity and a small white head that doesnt last but laces up very well. Opens with the same bready and doughy malt character. Hop Flavors of citrus and resin slam into the middle and carry the fruity yeast notes well into the finish. Aftertaste is lightly sweet with plenty of fresh hop characters like herbal and orange. Body is medium with large bubble carbonation, no warmth or astringency and just a touch of creaminess. Delicious and one of my favorites.","Ohio, USA","cracklefish"
25,"2011-11-26",4.0,"Floral bouquet, odd for a wheat beer, lillies and rosehips discernible. Clear amber, medium head, nice lacing. Wheat and lilly flavor, tangy lemon. A hoppy american wheat, which is a stroke of genius, since the style lacks lack the fruity esters of the german hefes. I finally got my hands on a few of these, courtesy of some friends who made a pilgrimmage to 3Fs. It is well worth the wait.

Nose initially dank, lightly dusty and dirty with citrus and a strong wheat presence, reminiscent of a few New Glarus wheat beers. Flavor is a bit green at front, some paper in the finish, but likely my favorite FFF beer Ive tried in years, reminds of JP ES Bam (though of course not that bright) with the sparkling carbonation, grains swirling, and nice hop (though here more dank, expressive, forceful than ES).","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

Really hoppy-sweet nose-smell. Good, light crisp carbonation. Great, dry texture. Nice, juicy hop taste to the wheat, this could probably pass for a fresh-hop pale ale.

25,"2011-11-19",4.5,"Serving glass: Poured from bottle into Nonic Imperial Pint.

Appearance: Very cloudy straw-gold with medium-sized stark white cap. Slight lacing.

Aroma: Grapefruit, lemon zest and dried-out wheat. This is my third Three Floyds beer, and they all smell damn good.

Taste: Refreshing wheat malt body with very hoppy notes of grapefruit, lemon and even more tropical nuances. Some white pepper on the finish, but very little bitterness.

Palate: Moderately high carbonation with a light, crisp body. Finish is very dry and refreshing.

Overall: Wow, a Wheat beer that manages to be both hoppy and balanced. And unlike Lagunitas Little Sumpin Sumpin (which is really more of an IPA), I can actually tell this is a wheat beer.

A good friend of mine in NW Indiana uses a case of Gumballhead to successfully bribe his NW Chicago supplier of computer parts into better prices on his purchases.  So this beers reputation precedes my review.  Im a big Three Floyds fan, but would rather drink Alpha King at the same price.  Theres nothing wrong with Gumballhead, but it isnt quite as intense as their mainstream or seasonal pale ales.  I would never have guessed that this was a wheat beer if I hadnt read the label.  The aroma is full of pine and grapefruit.  It pours a mostly clear amber with a quickly vanishing small head.  Not a whole lot of carbonation, but a great hoppy taste, as expected from 3 Floyds.  Body is thinner than most other FFF brews, and the finish is short but pleasant.  Very drinkable and pleasant, but somewhat less than outrageous.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ccex"

Nose is pretty much just hops; amarillo, citrus, fruity, grapefruit, lemon, wheat, etc.  Taste is pretty much the same, huge hops for a wheat beer, not overly bitter, but big on citrus/mildly spicy, fresh, crisp, earthy hops with a discernible wheat edge.  This brew is super drinkable, flavorful, and fairly light in body/mouthfeel - the spicy/citrusy hop character is the most noticeable part of this, especially at the very end as the hops fruity taste linger in the aftertaste.

Kind of hard to take style into account here, as this is a very one of a kind beer!

Appearance- Golden in color with minimal head or lacing. Love the label!

Smell- The aroma is similar to an American Pale Ale, as there is a prominent citrus hop presence. 

Taste- I found this beer to be very balanced. The citrus hops flavor was very nicely complemented with the wheat malt flavor. 

Mouthfeel- Very light on the tongue. Nothing exceptional to note, but I could easily drink a growler of this over the course of a night.

Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a thin, fizzy half finger white head that immediately disappears leaving only the smallest spots of lacing.

Surprisingly hoppy aroma for the style with a prominent earthy pine presence as well as hints of citrus and tropical. Im picking up pine needle, grapefruit and lemon peel as well as some faint malt but not many characteristics of a wheat beer. Slight bread/yeast and citrus fruit but not much in the way of spice/clove. It smells great just not like a wheat beer.

Medium bodied with a good balance of earthy and citrus hops, crisp, light fruit, citrus peel and spice. There is some earthy pine needle and citrus/tropical fruit notes from the hops but it isnt as hop forward as the aroma suggests. The wheat beer characteristics are much more prevalent in the palate and flavor. Good balance of bread/yeast, citrus peel and clove notes.

Much more bitter than any wheat ale Ive ever encountered.  The generous amount of hops added to this brew makes it come off as more of a pale ale than a wheat ale.

25,"2010-06-29",3.7,"12 oz bottle from the brewery, served in a weizen glass. Pours clear yellow-golden with a small, rocky white head and a few small particles of sediment. The head fades quickly to a minimal cover but leaves some lace as it goes. The aroma has prominent notes of citrus along with some floral and fruity notes from Amarillo hops. There is also a touch of yeast and grass, with some wheat. The flavour starts with a restrained sweetness up front and develops a tangy acidity through the middle. Hops are present all the way through and these grow towards the finish. The finish is long with hops and citrus lingering on the palate. Palate is light-medium in body with a watery texture and lively carbonation. Overall, this is a very unconventional example of a wheat ale, but its very, very good. It is more assertive than most wheat beers and much more complex. I was disappointed with the initial appearance, but the aroma makes up for it. The Amarillo is a beautiful complement to the wheat. A great summertime patio beer for beer geeks. 2010-06-29","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neuromatt"

Golden orange with a small off-white head with good retention.

The aroma is all about fresh, slightly raw citric hops. Lovely lemon and grapefruit notes. Grass and resiny with notes of tobacco. Gentle wheat notes. The smell gets more blurry and round when the yeast goes in the glass. 

The flavor is actually much lighter than expected. Sweet caramel and hints of wheat. Grassy and citric hops, slightly less aromatic than in the smell. The finish is mildly bitter and a bit oily due to mellow carbonation. Ends mildly sweet with hints of grassy hops.

Moderate body.

For a wheat ale and considering the low ABV, this is quite impressive, and to be frank I think it is the first American style wheat beer Ive had that wasnt completely pointless. But more aroma hops would have made it more in line with the cocky exterior.","Malme, SWEDEN","ricke"

T- Some grapefruit flavor upfront with a small amount of yeast backbone. The taste gets really interesting for the finish where a big grapefruit juice flavor comes through along with a distinct sweet wheat flavor, a touch of pine, and a touch of bitterness. What lingers is some Citrus hop resin, some grapefruit and other citrus flavor, and a touch of sweet yeast.

Not a bad brew just lacking the impact I have come to expect from 3Fs brews.

Re-rate (3/29/2013):  First time I have had this fresh, believe it or not.  Usually cant count on whats on the shelf, but now that there is a lot of turnover of the product at my local liquor store...lets go!  Much fresher hop aroma with more of a sweet, floral pine and wheat malt aroma.  Flavor is wheat malt sweetness with light pine and citrus bitterness trailing to a lightly bitter and dry finish.

S: Things start to get much better in the aroma. A nice, bright citrus hop aroma with a fair amount of pine to go along with it. Not much malt or wheat to speak of in the nose.

T: Like the nose would indicate, a solid hop presence. The grapefruit is front and center with a mild pine on the finish. The malt and wheat provide a bit of sweetness in the middle of the tongue.

M: A light, crisp beer with fairly high carbonation.

25,"2010-02-19",4.4,"The aromas of this beer convinced my brother, strictly gluten-free, to break his diet for it.  Worth it?  I dont know, but this really is pretty excellent.  Pours surprisingly dark - a medium amber - and clear for a bottle-conditioned wheat beer.  Very little head.  Aromas of summer fruits - apricot and muscat grape - leap off the glass, and upon sipping floral hop aromas predominate.  This gives way to an almost IPA-like impression, a fairly malty flavor balanced by very American hops.  This is a hop-lovers wheat; the aromas are complex and magnificent.  But they do not overpower; the tastes of fruit and malt weave in and out of the swiftly-departing bitterness, creating a cohesive and melodious whole.  A superb wheat beer.","Michigan, USA","jodah52"

Pours a hazy gold colour with a two finger heads that disolves down to a thin film, leaves behind some nice lacing. The aroma is very hop forward, reminds me of a bit of southern tiers IPA, but a with a welcome element from the wheat. The flavour is also very hopped up, citrus, alot of lemon flavour in this beer, I agree with most when they say the hops are a little muted by the wheat, but im thinking this was intentional, if it was just straight up hoppy, itd be an IPA. The wheat does bring some flavour to the party, but its a little shy when held up against the life of the party (the hops), not exactly balanced, I agree with thirdeye, it could use a little malt backbone. Mouthfeel is a little thing, but I think the idea of this beer is flavour in harmony with drinkability, and they achieved that.

Theres a hint of grassiness in there too, but not much else. Its not complex, but thats okay--it smells delicious. The taste is interesting, kind of like NG Crackd Wheat, where youve got that APA/hefe hybrid. It falls a little short of CW, however, in that the two seem out of balance. The wheat overpowers the hops and really mute out the grapefruit, and the whole thing leaves a sour, funky finish and aftertaste. Its pretty light, though a bit syrupy. I could drink a 100 of these if not for the aftertaste and accompanying breath that would knock a moose over.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

Aroma is full of fresh citric hoppiness, with some grapefruit, lemon peel, and a subtle earthiness.  Further sniffs reveal some cheerios, mint, celery, and orange marmalade.  Taste has flavors of watered-down orange juice, some guava, and finishes out with flavors of breakfast cereal and orange marmalade.  In-between the orange and cereal is a brief hit of bitter hops that provides a nice tea-like astringency.  Aside from the nose, nothing really stands out here.

Smell is pretty straightforward. Grapefruit galore. In fact Ive never smelled a beer anything quite like this. Its good, refreshing, and straight up grapefruit. Not complex but solid. Maybe some spices here too. Taste is muted grapefruit compared to the smell. Its a wheaty beer compared to how pale and clear this one is, but it is a little fruity, definitely spicy, and nicely refreshing. Hops are present here too and nicely done.

This was one of the most straight-forward aggressive hop-fests Ive had in awhile, and considering that my most recent ratings were Double Bastard, 120 Minute, and Ruination, thats saying something. Id put it closest to Ruination, as there is almost no malty flavor to offset the hoppiness. Its decidedly uncomplex--very clear taste, cuts like a laser, and it goes down easily.

Flavor was slightly more prominently wheat, but also had a ton of tropical fruit flavor, with the pineapple and apricot and a lot of grapefruit as well.

Thanks to kseecs for sending this along with some other Three Floyds beers in a very recent trade.  Knowing that Gumballhead is at its best when fresh I did not hesitate to open it just as soon as it had settled a bit.  My reward was a fabulous sessionable IPA/wheat ale which is near the top of its class.

Aroma / Appearance - The foamy stark white body contrasted against the carbonated golden fluid beneath.  As it percolated upwards the bubbles released a blend of fresh pine, grapefruit, and malt.  Hoppy and strong I have always thought of this more as an IPA than a wheat ale.

Flavor / Palate - Fluid and smooth it tickles the tongue and throat before easing into the stomach.  As it makes its voyage it leaves a trail of calm bitterness that tastes like a blade of fresh grass.  Excellent all around I am glad that this is a regular release that has not lost anything over time.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Light wheaty notes, herbs, and clove, but the flavors are centered around citrus and a strong hoppy profile for whats supposed to be a Wheat.  Really solid stuff.

Tastes like gumballs with a heavy dose of amarillo hops and has a lemony citrus finish. Hardly bitter. This beer is a fine showcase for the flavor and aroma profile of amarillo hops.

25,"2009-01-20",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 17, 2009 12 oz bottle into pint glass, served at cellar temperature 50F.  Pretty weak clear light golden color with a big white creamy head that holds and laces well.  Where the hell is the wheat beer haze?  This thing is crystal clear.  The aroma is beautiful.  With a big whiff you get lots of amarillo hops with a faint hint of wheat.  But, when you sil your glass with a big head and sit it of the table, you pick up the more subtle aromas of cotton candy, yeast, and sweet fruit.  The flavor isnt as outgoing but still very nice.  Great hop character accompanied by a subdued wheat quality.  Superbly balanced.  One of the best session beers around (if only it were a bit cheaper this would be an easy regular).  Feels light on the palate but more textured than expected for such a light beer.  Soft medium carbonation - not overly carbonated like many wheats.  Overall: my glass is vanishing rapidly!!  Not a typical wheat (I certainly wouldnt have called it a wheat beer in a blind tasting), but yet another flawless offer from FFF.  I also love this label.

25,"2009-01-13",4.0,"UPDATED: SEP 15, 2010 Draught at Birreria Paradiso.   Opaque gold-amber with a small head that leaves just a bit of foam.   Straight grapefruit juice with all the pulp left in for the most part.   Big hops in the nose, with juicy grapefruit, orange, and some sharper pine sap.   considering that this keg must be left over from last summer, the hops are still pretty pungent.   The wheat base is a bit sweet and tangy, with a creamy texture.   Big hops in the finish, like orange-lemon-pine, perfect amount of bitterness, but then again I like bitterness.   Not exactly typical of the style, but then again, typically the style sucks.   Medium-light bodied with the yeast making it feel more substantial and smooth.   My only gripe is that the carbonation level is just a bit too low, probably also contributed to the lackluster head.   I wish there was a summer seasonal available in California that was this good!Rerate: Draught at Local Option.   Almost perfectly clear this time.   Filtered?   Seems like either that or the keg was disturbed the last time I had it.   Big orangey amarillo aroma.   This is the second al- amarillo beer of the day, and it works much better in this setting with a clean yeast, versus the hefe yeast that Goose Islands beer used.   Just kind of a bitter resiny fruit; very simple, straight-forward and drinkable.   Nice dryness but hint of wheat texture and sweetness as well.   Still great but definitely different than before.

Very smooth through the mouth with the hops and lemon intertwining perfectly.  Unlike most wheat beers which tend to be heavier on the lemon - Gumballhead throws some serious hops in the mix.

Taste is initially dominated by biscuit pale malts leading to lemon citrus hops, some bubblegum sweetness and syrupy fruits, finishes bitter and drying.

Mouthfeel is light-bodied, watery and thin texture, very high carbonation is almost distracting.

Subtle roastiness appears then fades almost instantly as the brew passes the tongue. Towards the finish, pine becomes a little more evident. The finish has some nice round, smooth citric notes that’s well complemented with a bready dryness and a light bitterness. This is very thirst quenching.

Very approachable and tasty.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","mcmd"
25,"2008-05-15",3.6,"Bottle from Eithcubes. Pours a fairly clear orange with a thin head. The aroma is mostly a rich hops and citrus, also some grains.

I enjoyed this one quite a bit.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"
25,"2008-05-14",3.4,"This one came in from Eithcubes. The lesson to be learned from this beer is that amarillo hops = bubblegum flavors/aromas. Getting more of an IPA than a wheat experience but I am not complaining. Clear golden orange color. Wheat style comes through faintly on the finish. A little banana and grain flavors there. Straight amarillo is a little one dimensional.  A good dimension but still one dimension.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"

Initial flavor has the presence of a wheat plus all the hops.  Balanced taste throughout, hoppiness overtakes at the end.  Moderate lacing, light to medium body, moderate carbonation, without any signs of alcohol.  Very drinkable, especially for hop heads or open minded fans of wheat beers.","Boardman, Ohio, USA","joekfsu"
25,"2008-05-03",3.6,"Pours a bright , slightly hazy golden with a very small white head that faded quickly but left a slight swirl of foam on top throughout.  Lacing was light to moderate.  The smell is surprisingly dominated by hops not wheat.  Major resiny pine scents and some lemony citrus aromas form an interesting mix with the sweet wheat.  The taste starts with a mild wheat sweetness which gives way almost immediately to a nice crisp hop bite dominated by citrus and pine.  The finish is very crisp with a slight hop bitterness balanced by a hint of the wheat.  Very crisp and highly carbonated with an overall moderate mouthfeel, heavier than I would expect in a wheat beer.  This one is seriously drinkable if not easily categorized.  As summer approaches here in Atlanta, this one would be a staple in the fridge if I had access to it.  Very refreshing.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

25,"2007-12-23",4.7,"Review from 2006.

Pours a very nice golden color with a nice pillowy head that leaves a wonderful lacing on the glass, clearer than most wheat style beers. Smell is hoppy, opens with a floral bouquet and finishes with citrus smells (orange, lemon) and even has some pine in there as well. Taste is glorious, I swear I tasted some banana and bubblegum before the hops takeover mid-drink and hit you with a refreshing citrus burst. Light to medium bodied with a medium carbonation, it really could not be improved on for the style. Drinkability, umm, yeah I could have this wherever, whenever and plenty of it.

Additional information: My bottle was refridgerated since its summer release, and is still this good now, thats just crazy, I was afraid to buy it at first because of how long it was sitting there, but Im so glad I did.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

Also has a light soapiness in the end.  Not bad.","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","Juelze"

25,"2007-12-18",4.0,"12oz bottle from unclejedi. Orange juice looking pour with a 2 finger thick, pillowy white head. HUGE grapefruit aroma, smells like a fleshy, perfectly ripe ruby red grapefruit. Havent encountered grapefruit to that degree in any other beer thus far. Also pick up hints of pineapple, sweet citrus candy and wheat, with a huge hop backing. The grapefruit is toned down quite a bit in the flavor, but still present, along with more sweet citrus and wheat, and tons of hops. Thin to medium bodied, nicely carbonated and feels perfect for the style as you drink it. Heavily astringent, but doesnt detract at all from the experience. Finish is medium in length, citrus and sugars followed by bittering hops. The aroma is just enormous and phenomenal, and the flavor lives up to that billing.

Small head that manages to stick around and laces fairly well. Aroma of hops, citrus, and some wheaty notes. Taste is wonderful. Hops and citrus with the wheat beer finish I truly enjoy. Hoppy cerealesque finish. Wheat and a lemony aftertaste that is a little candy-ish and sticks to the palate and is reminiscent of about 15-30 minutes after youve eaten some Lemonhead candies. A hoppy assertive wheat beer that is wonderfully done.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Im not one that has completely bought into the FFF craze so far, but this was a very enjoyable variation of a wheat, which is nice to see today!

Refreshing amounts of zesty citrus hops and fresh wheat and grassy notes in the aroma; oranges and lemon peel; quite nice nose.  Medium mouthfeel: husky wheat and cereal and fresh citrus (lemon and orange) hops upfront; carbonation is a bit spritzy; this tastes more like a very drinkable hybrid IPA/Belgian than any sort of wheat ale I can think of, although the wheatiness is certainly present; nice zing of citrus on the edges of the tongue; well-balanced.

25,"2007-07-17",4.0,"Bottle that mreusch brought back form Chicago. I can see why this is the #1 rated American Wheat. It is hands-down the best I have ever tasted and by a large margin. Pours a hazy gold with a frothy, white head. The nose is of grassy hops, wheat and a faint citrus. Light-bodied and thin with moderate carbonation, it finishes lightly bitter--rare for an American Wheat. The flavor is a sweet wheat with solid grassy and citrus hops. This is, by far, the hoppiest wheat that Ive ever sampled, but it is still quite well balanced. The Amarillos really dominate the character of this easy drinker, and it makes me wonder why more brewers havent tried to do something similar with a wheat.

I do believe that I have found a new summertime favorite beer.  A nice wheat with the patented Three Floyds twist.  It poured a nice light golden color with a short lived small head.

This is one of my favorite warm weather beers and Im finally getting around to reviewing it. So here it is.

Gumballhead poured a very nice slightly hazed golden. A quarter inch white head. All kinds of carbonation bubbles along the sides of my pint glass.

This beer smells great. So refreshing. Theres a tiny amount of malt but its mostly just citrus hops. Lemon mostly. Smells like candy. My mouth is watering and I cant wait to drink this up.

I get a mouthful of citrus right up front but is quickly balanced by by a slightly sweet wheat malt. Ends with more citrus(lemon) from the hops and the smallest amout of pine. A good bitterness lingers for a few seconds and vanishes. Theres enough hops to keep my mouth tingly until the next gulp though.

Mouthfeel is on the lighter side. Just the right amount of carbonation to keep things going and move the flavors around in your mouth.

Drinkability is way up there. Its so easy going down and it keeps you wanting more with the nice hop bite.

This beer must kick ass when its fresh and on tap in the summer.

Smell; mmm....hops, and lots of them for a wheat beer. Pine and citrus smells come floating out of my glass, as well as some mild hints of caramel malts. But where is the wheat in this wheat beer?

Taste; those piney and citric hops are right there in your face, but I like it. The sweet malts definitely make a nice appearance, once you let this warm up a bit. The wheat is more felt than tasted, and lightly at that, which gives this a close to medium bodied mouthfeel. This reminds me more of an APA or IPA than it did of a wheat beer, but despite the lack of any wheat flavors, I still like this offering from Three Floyds.

The beer pours a light orange and is lightly hazy.  There is a pretty plentiful amount of head, but its resiliency is limited.

Aroma is sweet and slightly citrus-y, but not too impressive. 

Taste is awesome!  This beer is fairly light for an APA, but very lively and citrusy.  It is bitter without being overpowering.  You could definitely enjoy several pints of this at a sitting and not feel like a Macys Day parade balloon.

The mouthfeel of this beer is great.  Is heavily carbonated with light, small bubbles, and is lighter than many other big-time APAs.  A very good beer that is worth picking up whenever you can find it.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","BeerBelcher"

25,"2006-10-25",3.1,"From 22oz Bottle.  Hazy, golden body with a light naval orange skin hue, topped with a fizzy, quickly dissipating head of banana creme.  Hoppy aroma of lemon zest, sweet orange pulp, and granny smith apple skins.  Some more mundane notes of under-ripe strawberry add a subtly floral-fruity underlayer.  Slightly syrupy, medium bodied, crisply carbonated mouthfeel.  Like the head, the carbonation fades quickly on the palate, leaving behind a watery, wheaty residue.  Unfortunately, this is the only stylistic hint I get from this beer.  Im left searching aimlessly for a glimpse of pheonlic yeast or hearty wheat character.  Instead, Im finding more of a pale ale thats complimented by a strange, creamy malt backing.  The hops are definitely too overpowering for me, as the west coast character even clashes a bit with the wheat bill on my palate.  In addition, the body is a bit on the heavy side to be considered refreshing.

25,"2006-07-10",2.6,"22 oz bottle.  I bought this beer mainly because my wife loves good American Wheat beers.

Keep in mind that my wife does NOT like IPAs.  To her, as well as my, dismay, we found that this beer was in fact a cloudy, wheaty-appearing IPA.  It is not a wheat beer as it is advertised.  I loved it becasue I love hops.  I rate this beer low because it isnt what it should be not becasue its bad - because its very good.

Bitterness is refreshing and not to overdone.  Very drinkable.  Also picking up flavors of pineapple, toffee, and leather.  Palate:  Good carbonation that lends to the refreshing nature of the beer.

Smells like marijuana, potpourri flowers, candy, hops, sugar, citrus fruits, and love. Everything good and sweet all come together is perfect, intense sinergy.

25,"2006-05-23",3.7,"Ok, I was a little curious as to what this was going to be like. Im not a fan of lighter/yellow beers, but alas, 3Fs comes through once again and defies what we all know as the American Wheat beer. Upon pouring, you really arent that impressed, looks a hair darker than macro. But upon placing your nose deep in the glass, you know that it is MUCH different. Amarillo hops blast you with zesty citrus smells. The aroma, as with most 3Fs brews, is nothing short of outstanding. Stick you nose in the glass long enough and you really can find some maltiness/grain, no really you can, I promise. Once you get past the wonderful aroma and you are ready to drink, you are equally impressed with the spicey wheat and malts. This brew is very well balanced. The aroma would have you believe that this is a hop monster, in fact it is not. It is perfectly balanced lending to an extremely drinkable, delicate treat. The mouth feel is just perfect. It is an extremely thirst quenching brew. Id rate this beer much higher, but it lacks the complexity that I prefer.

Only slightly hazy pour with very little head. I understand that the American Wheat style is supposed to be less spicy and more hoppy than its german counterpart but 3F blows this so out of proportion it becomes no different than a standard american IPA (or, well, APA, in 3Fs case). The wheat character is so suppressed it is basically unnoticable unless you were looking for it. I know you arent supposed to rate to style, and I usually dont, but this kinda pisses me off, especially since all the reviews below me are gushing about how this is basically such a great IPA. Isnt the whole purpose behind style percentiles to show people what the best in the style is, so we can actually have scales for styles whether people rate to them or not? Cause I can imagine many being pretty pissed off when they finally get their hands on the #1 American Wheat and find out it really isnt a wheat at all, its just a normal ol IPA.... *cough cough*","New York, New York, USA","puzzl"

Flavor starts briefly with a nice wheat taste.... and that is the only thing that resembles a wheat beer in Gumballhead for me.  The wheat is quickly swept to the side by floral hops with a hint of citrus.  There is a nice soft carbonation that enhances the flavors.  While there are lots of hops here it is soft on the palate and very easy drinking.  Im looking foward to having this one again.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

Strong hoppyness in the aroma, wheaty, juicey, with sweet maltyness also.

This is a great wheat beer!","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","tcruicks"
25,"2006-05-13",4.0,"Pours a half shade darker than macro yellow with a mediocre head and lotsa bubbles streaming to the top.  Worried?  Well, a little bit.  All I had to do to assuage my fears was put my nose over the glass.  In one word, this aroma is juicy.  Fantastic resinous tropical fruit peach scented hops.  If only all IPAs were this bold!  Theres a subtle light malty sweetness to fill out the aroma profile.  Great mouthfeel for a wheat or any other beer for that matter.  Creamy and smooth, foaming up on contact with the mouth.  Though this is a great beer in the aroma, it falters slightly in the taste, though perhaps only because the aroma  is so big.  The same juicy hops immediately attack.  You get that lovely grapefruit on the sides of the tongue taste from this beer, which I also enjoy.  The light sweet malt balances the big hops with some wheaty bread-like notes taking over in short order.  A lingering hoppy bitterness decays slowly in a very pleasant way.  Though this lacks complexity, I still enjoy this beer.  This is a wheat beer that defies convention.  Im really glad to see a wheat that doesnt taste of banana/cloves or have some silly fruit flavor.  Definitely my favorite wheat beer of all time.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

Intense (well, for a wheat beer) aroma of hops.  More complex in the mouth than I would have thought given the nose.  Hops mix with more typical fruity wheat flavors at the start (though the hops definitely dominate) and then finishes moderately bitter.  Clean and well-carbonated on the palate.

I dont care very much for most beers of this style, but the aroma is making me feel better about this brew. Its quite zesty, piny, and lemony like an IPA. The flavor is even better with plenty of bright lemon hoppiness balanced with a good caramel foundation. The wheat comes out in the finish with some bark and sweeter lemon notes which makes Gumballhead  truly interesting. wow. Lots of very true lemon taste here.  Easily my favorite American wheat or Hefeweizen thus far.

Six pack from the brewery. My latest visit to Chicago of course led to a good amount to consumption of FFF beers. I have to say, I was disappointed in Robert the Bruce and Alpha King. They didnt seem to live up to what my memory served me. Gumballhead, however, is as solid as ever.

Medium body that is velvety smooth. Big hop flavors of lemon and orange over a sweet caramel malt backbone. For a beer with so much hop aroma and flavor, the lack fo bitterness came as a surprise.

Perhaps this is due to age?  Smells tasty, nonetheless.  Mildly hazy honey color with a small whitish head.  Juicy orange hoppy start, turning quickly dry and grainy.  The wheat really comes through.  Finishes with more grapefruity bitter hopping.  This is about what I expected and believe it or not, it is quite comparable to Southern Tiers Hop Sun.

I have no doubt wheat is in there, and you do taste it a little at first, but this is essentially a forum for hops.

25,"2005-09-06",3.9,"(22 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with bkelley68, thanks Brian!) First off, an important point: I obtained this in a trade, and let it age for 13 months.  Not only has this beer held up well, it’s absolutely delicious!  A wheat beer, huh?  Uhm, okay, whatever you crazy dudes at Three Floyds say.  Technically, it may be a wheat beer, but it tastes much more like a lightly hoppy and very fruity American Pale Ale to me, with wheat being the underlying malt base.  Very fruity (apricot and pear), sweet, lemony, mildly hoppy tasting, moderately bitter, did I say fruity yet?  Wow, extremely fruity.  It was probably hoppier when fresh, but frankly, I wouldn’t want this to be any hoppier, so I think aging has helped that aspect for me.  Certain elements of this beer, mostly the fruits, are reminding me of a dessert wine (specifically, Raymond Eloquence), but obviously with considerably less sweetness and viscosity.  The nose is also very fruity, again reminding me of a fine dessert wine.  Body is medium, with a balanced and long-lasting palate.  Very easy to drink, but don’t confuse that with being light on flavor.  Very hazy, dark golden color, with a medium size white head that settles to a broken film.  However, lacing is solid, with large patches of foam covering the glass.  I’m no Three Floyds shill, but goddamn, this is really a delicious beer.  But to call this an American Wheat is rather misleading.  Or, I guess there’s a different perspective -- perhaps brewers of American Wheats should use this as their benchmark.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

I was sorely disappointed as this is an incredibly overrated beer.  Pours a slightly hazy light yellow with a big head that abandons with great haste, leaving odd spotted lace.  I guess the look of the lace should have scared me.  The nose is alarming... more hoppy than expected with very little spice or sweetness.  More of a raw hop aroma than I anticipated.  A little smell of lemon here too.  Flavor has a biting bitterness immediately evident followed by a musty gritty dirty flavor - this is not a nice taste at all.  It coats the tongue with a numbing bitter pasty taste and feel.  Not impressive.  The great lack of body and carbonation seals the deal on a crappy brew.  They havent even used a good wheat yeast.  I would consider this to be more like a pilsner.  I dont really like this one, if you havent figured that out.  I think that too many people fell in love with Three Floyds and thought that they had to rate this beer well.  I dont, and I wont.

Pours a crystal clear orangey copper with a frothy snow white head. Quite lacy. Smells of citrusy hops and lightly of sweet wheat malt.

Taste is basic but does it well. Delivers crisp what malt followed by huge amount of hops (amarillo according to the bottle) and some lemony flavor throughout. Three great tastes that taste great together. Crisp and bright mouthfeel. Tasty. I can see why this has such a following, especially for a summer beer.

With the name, I thought this beer had captured the bubblegum flavor of a true hefe and thats what they were pushing. Boy, was I wrong but still a great beer. Its almost as if they thought to themselves, ""Hey, its hard for us American brewers to make a true German style wheat so lets not try. Lets do something original.""

Excellent brew.","Levittown, Pennsylvania, USA","stegosaurus"
25,"2005-07-23",3.1,"I believe this beer is mislabled.  It should be classified as an IPA.  The label claims it is brewed with ""boat loads of Amarillo hops.""  Yes, I concur.  It is a very hoppy beer both in aroma and flavor.  If anyone is expecting this to be a dry wheat beer, they will be disappointed as I was.  Right out of the bottle, this one pours great - clear amber, lots of white head and decent lacing.  However, the aromatic hops take over from there.  There is a piney taste initially.  I could hardly taste any citrus, except when the flavor of bitter hops began to subside.  Even then, it was only a fleeting taste.  This has a slightly oily taste, but medium body.  Overall, its not a bad beer in any way, except I felt misled by the label.  Caveat emptor, I guess.","Joliet, Illinois, USA","Tubbfan"

Fruity aroma with plenty of sweet citrus, fresh biscuits and hops.  Superbly balanced and inviting combination of flavors which open with an IPA profile and finish with just a kiss of spicey, yeasty wheat.  Grapefruit, pine, malt, apricots, hops and a touch of spice.  Mouthfeel was full and satisfying with a moderate carbonation bite.  Finish was sweet, crisp, bitter and inviting of another long sip.  Its hard to call this a ""wheat"" ale because it lacks many of the hallmark notes of a traditional American Wheat but it also has much more flavor and complexity.

An average looking beer, with a typical amber body and a quick white head. But the aromas are what knock you on your ass, with a heavy dose of pine hops and ""new leather smell"". I thought that I might have gotten a mislabeled bottle (Alpha King?), but I later noticed the yeast which appeared as a few large chunks rather than as the cloudiness Id expected from a wheat. Damn good citrus bitter flavors and a dry, biting finish.

The Festivities:An assertive wheat bite surprises considering the hoppy proclivity of the aroma. Hops are subdued, and leave way to an earthy yeasty flavor which actually lifts the floral and lemony hop perfume. Not as bright as the aroma, but an agreeable summer pint.

25,"2005-04-06",2.3,"I picked up this gem at the Southport brewery.  I must say I was not prepared for the assault that would be released upon my palate when I took my first sip.  They call this beer GUMballhead for a reason ladies and gentlemen!  My palate sensed many different types of gum used in the brewery process.  I sensed with my super-nose that as many different gums where used to make this beer.  Upon first sip I was hit immediately with a taste of Wrigleys Big Red brand followed by a hint of Winterfresh.  As I continued to soak my advanced palate I sensed Trident and Bubblicious.  The last flavor I sensed was that of Bazooka.  Some of your palates might be confused when I tell you there is Bazooka in the mix.  Rest assured it is there, and the flavor lingers with you long after the bottle is finished.  I was confused why they did not get Bazooka Joe himself for the bottle label.  Instead they got some lame ass cat/cow/pig thing for the label.  Pretty damn disappointing on that note.  I wanted to see the loveable Bazooka Joe comic strips on each bottle.  You would think that Three Floyds would be able to shell out the cash to get good old Joe on each bottle considering there massive operation out of Munster, Indiana.  (I have been to the brewery quite amazing stuff!)  Anyways, back to the beer.  I believe in the future nobody will have to chew gum anymore.  This beer is so much like gum it will replace all chewable kinds.  If you like gum and you like getting drunk this beer is for you.  But if you still want the comics go with Bazooka Joe.

25,"2004-12-16",3.3,"I dont know that I was all that thrilled by this, which is not to say that I wasnt impressed by it, only that it hit me in odd ways.  First, for appearance there isnt anything too shocking going on--just a bit of simple white yeast floaties and a basically yellow body, not much head.  O.k., move on.  Appearance rarely makes or breaks a beer.  As I sat with Lumpy at my kitchen table, we both reacted at how clearly the hops leap out of this, strongly citrus, mostly grapefruit, and I had a sense of some anise later on.  The flavor had lots of citrus, too, of course, prompting comparisons with IPAs and APAs, but I found some bubblegum notes that tickled my fancy whenever I thought my tongue had latched onto it.  I couldnt hang on--it is difficult to hang onto anything with ones tongue, I guess.  Very dry, with a hint of pepper and tea leaves, and the hops are notable--I certainly cant pick out amarillo hops from a blind taste test but I am inclined to attribute much to their influence, especially some grassy strains.  I was most disappointed by the palate; for me it was too limp, though it had some moderate body.  I thought it really needed a carbonated life (not exactly fizz but at least something zingy).  Otherwise it was fine, but it just wasnt my cup of tea, I mean, glass of beer.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"

Slight haze from the yeast injection, but quite filtered other than that.  Aroma of light citrus, from the dominant amarillo hops.  Light nectarine, tangerine and honey notes as well as a dry wheatiness.  Flavor starts out with light grapefruit, sweet and succulent fresh hops, plenty of light malt sweetness.  Great amount of hard red wheat flavor on the finish, with tons of grassy tones.  The malt is tremendously well represented, creating a wonderful backbone to match the loads of amarillos in here.  Finish is wheaty, grassy and lightly bitter, mostly dry.  Medium to medium-full body, with some thinning as it warms.  Yeast apparency is very low and while everything else in this beer screams #1 american wheat beer Ive tried, ultimately Bells Oberon imparts an aggressive yeastiness that adds another layer of complexity, lacking in the gumbalhead.  Granted Oberon uses a German yeast, so it is a partially-unfair comparison.  But yeast or no yeast, the highly unfiltered nature of Oberon in the bottle puts it a notch above Gumbalhead.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Ooh...and ahh...a very nice taster. Sweet wheat front, dullest of dull lemon, floating grasses, great sugary return. Finishes with a slight hop drying of nonbittering pine and floral traits, left over sugars and fresh wheaty sweetness and dulled fruit drifting off. Rich, giving, smooth, and crisp, with just the right amount of everything. One well balanced and easy goin treat. I can see why gumball was intregated into the name as it has a candyish character about it.

Feel is of a perfectly drinkable medium body thats very well rounded in cabonation, smooth, lightly crisp while maintaining a certain thick and rich hold.

The flavor is a good amount of crisp wheatiness livened up with some grapefruit/juniper hops, making a very crisp, very refreshing brew. This is imminently drinkable.

Tastes like biting an orange. Very light on the tongue. Similar to drinking orange flavor soda water. There is also a little tropical note of pineapple. I get a little bit of almonds.

Had a wimpy little pfftt when opened. Poured out a golden straw color, with a volumous white head at first that quickly slid back to a more-than-decent lacing down the sides of my wheat beer glass.
Aromas are of lemon juice, very slight and weak maltiness, yeast, and a piney, resinous hoppiness as well. The Amarillo hops make this wheat beer stand out from any other Ive had so far. Tastes are of lemon zest, slight malts, and the famous Amarillo hops. Medium mouthfeel, not too thick or too thin. Finishes crisp and hoppy. A fair to decent wheat beer, but not worth all the hype put upon it. Not by a long stretch.","","Cobra"

Flavor is also quite IPA-ish, certainly loads of hops, some toasty malts at end, sweet and sticky.  Theres a bit more of a sweetness to it in the background than most IPAs, but this, while quite good, doesnt taste anything like a wheat beer.

The body is clear straw-colored with thin off-white head (OK, so there is a similarity!).

The flavor starts with the same elements as the aroma except for a dry, graininess at the finish.  I assume the husky finish is due to the wheat.

A blind taste would place this as a pale ale or maybe an IPA. A couple months of mellowing might bring out some malty/wheaty characteristics. Super hoppy beer for the summer that is lower in alcohol.

And the taste, holy crap is that stuff good. It's hop heavy with just tons of sweet smooth amarillos, but the balance is there most definitely. Citrus flavors move in and out on the tongue at different times.

Mouthfeel is creamy and smooth and that sets it head and shoulders above all the other American wheat beers.

I definitely know of no gumball that is quite so exquisite as this elixir.  This is a damn good Summer offering, certainly not a traditional wheat beer, but the wheat lightens this beer up and makes it a great summer refresher.

25,"2003-07-13",4.2,"UPDATED: AUG 16, 2004 2004 edition, Bottled. Bought a bomber bottle at the brewery, and it must have just come off the line. It pours with a big smell of fresh, green hops that just dazzles the nose. Foamy head more pilsner than wheat style. I think the smell helped overwhelm the grapefruit taste of the amarillo hops, because I couldn't find it easily. Maybe once it's sat for awhile, it will be closer to the way it tasted last year, but man, it's still great!
On tap, at the brewery, 2003. While my experience points are still low around here, I'll stick my neck out and say this is quite unlike any other beer out there. American Wheats are a little bland, unless they've been brewed with the spicy flavor of German wheats, but the Floyds never cared for following style. This has a big zesty wheat taste that I somehow guessed was North Dakota winter wheat, and Nick said I was right, but I don't know how I knew. Like with most 3F beers, there's a big smack in the face of hops, this one is all Amarillo, giving a different more orangey taste. Pleasing orange color, too.

The flavor is bold and perfectly balanced. Nicely bitter with heavy, damp straw.
Full-bodied with a syrupy/oily mouthfeel. Long, acrid, lightly bitter finish. Not my favorite style by a long shot, but a quality brew nonetheless!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
25,"2003-07-01",3.8,"Vegetable organic aroma (some carrot I found, oh yes!). Unique wheat. Very green and organic .Some spice, little malt and hops. Gets hopier with finish. Hard to rate because if its style. I liked it.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"
25,"2003-07-01",3.3,"On tap-3F Brewery. Darker yellow with thin head. Has a full hop aroma and is hoppy on the tongue. No noticeable wheatiness IMHO. Finishes slightly bitter.","Nolanville, USA","MrRomero"
25,"2003-06-30",3.7,"A super hoppy brew with light foam and a really nice, fresh (slightly cakey, sweet) aroma.  At the same time, it's tart but not bitter. The flavor is good, but seems short-lived. I'm not sure why it's called Gumballhead - must be an inside joke, since it's not at all candy.","Albion, Michigan, USA","hoppygrrrl"
25,"2003-06-30",3.4,"On tap @ the brewery, RBSG2003. Fresh and hoppy and ultra crisp - slightly fruity, not sweet, not bitter, quite good. Can't get the normal American Whet components because ofthe hopping, but I still liked it!","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
25,"2003-06-29",3.0,"UPDATED: AUG 14, 2004 Draft at the Brewery.  This brew pours a small head of fine to medium sized white bubbles and a weak whaet yellow body.  It had a mild malt-hop aroma.  Its flavor contained the typical 3 Floyds hop bite that is strong initailly yet softens in the finish.

Bottle:  This brew poured a small head of frothy finely sized mostly lasting bubbles that left behind a fair lacing.  The body was a carbonated transparent orange color with a few yeast particles floating in it.  The aroma was floral and hoppy.  The mouth feel was initially tingly with a hop presence and finished with a smooth hoppy aftertaste.  The flavor contained notes of hoops malt and mild caramel.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
25,"2003-06-29",3.7,"On tap at brewery. Medium yellow with an average sized rocky head, good lacing. Light to medium-bodied. Shocking aroma, very hoppy with hints of passion fruit, mint, orange, light molasses, and dough. Fruity and tart tasting, but still clean and refreshing. Lively and dry mouthfeel. A hop lovers wheat, nice summertime brew.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
25,"2003-06-27",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 27, 2004 ReRate-22 oz bomber-pours light orange with minimal white head.  Lots of hop aroma that smells like the best homebrewed pale ale.  lots of surupy sweet amarillo hops.  This is an awesome wheat beer!  This brew has the most robust palate for a wheat beer.  4.8%?  I  think this version is a little higher.  India Wheat beer?  I think so.  This one is even hoppier than i remember last years version.  My only gripe is that its filtered.....

Hmm, this is a pretty hoppy wheat beer, probably to hoppy for most.  The aroma is full of amarillo hops.  palate is full with hints of clove and orange, somewhat like that of oberon.  There is not much malt, but since when do wheat beers have malt?","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","Terminus"
25,"2003-06-14",3.6,"Two toned: light golden at the bottom turns a hazy golden orange/brown at the top.  A constant stream of bubbles raises from the bottom of my glass.  Large hoppy/grapefruit rind aroma - some nice sweetness as well.  Lots of orange and grapefruit flavours, very drinkable, but it is dominated by the hops. . . if you like that you'll enjoy this one.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
25,"2003-06-04",3.5,"Pours a clear golden hay color with a thin, persistent white head.  The aroma is of sweet hop juice, not too unlike AK or Dreadnaught.  The malt is incredibly subtle and light and doesn't really have much presense.  Especially considering the hops.  Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike it, but the malt doesn't move me and I don't think it's meant to.  This is an APA-lover/IPA-lover/Hophead wheat.  The hops aren't bitter, they just provide a nice flavor, which dominates the malt.  Refreshing and very drinkable.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
25,"2003-06-04",3.8,"Another great brew and we are beginning to expect nothing less.  Usual hop presence.  This beer reminds me of 1/3 Alpha King mixed with 2/3 Michelob wheat.  Very dry, refreshing and the hop is in the background.  This one is soon to be available in 22 oz bombers.","Bloomington, Illinois, USA","dlclark"
25,"2003-06-01",4.0,"funky nose, got me excited.  spicey piney, a bit musty, really crazy.   spicey the whole way with a bit of hops.  damn good","Anchorage, Alaska, USA","P-tor44"
25,"2003-05-27",3.6,"A nice combination of an apricotty, hoppy pale and a light summer American style wheat.  Not cloudy and thick or lemony like a German wheat, but clean and refreshing nonetheless!   The signature hoppiness that I love from 3F with the slight biscuity (but not drying) touch that must be the wheat.  I can't wait until we have some hot weather here, because this will be a perfect thirst quencher.","Crown Point, Indiana, USA","JoeM500"
25,"2003-05-19",3.5,"Pours to a small, frothy head that lingers in a laced whisp.  Color is light gold, slightly murky but not too actively carbonated.  Aroma is light, hoppy and somewhat sweet, (appropriately) like a spring blossom.  Taste is lightly sweet, lightly hoppy, very pleasant and refreshing.  Dull (meaning ""blunt"" or ""flat"" but not ""boring"") wheat taste with a touch of malt meets the sweetness and hops with a little bit of fruit; very welcome to find moderately strong hops with almost no bitterness.  Gumball?  A little bit, and the name only adds to this beer's charm.  Almost no alcohol flavor, which is not surprising.  Finish is more complex than average, but does not hold like one would hope.  Still, that only really encourages you to take another swig of this free-flowing goodness.  If it held a little longer and/or burst a little more with its flavor, this would be a real winner.  Good stuff, as it is.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"
25,"2003-05-10",3.7,"The aroma here is pure Three Floyds hopped up hop hop.  Floral, grapefruit, lemon.  The nose integrates well with the first sip and those are the major flavors that come through.  In the middle and end the wheat presents itself nicely.  An interesting take on the style.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
25,"2003-05-01",3.6,"Aroma is fruity--grapefruit and apricots. Color is quite orange, very clear. Was expecting this to be something in between SN's summer beer and Oberon--in other words drinkable but boring--but the hop kick really makes this one interesting. A somewhat musty wheat base is overlaid by a seriously bitter apricotty hop dosage. Finishes very dry, leaving you wanting more. Once again, 3F puts a unique spin on a style and pleases the palate.","St. Petersburg, Florida, USA","npdempse"
25,"2003-04-29",3.6,"On tap at FFF and Bone Dry. Golden orange color, good carbonation level, medium mouthfeel. Amarillo hop aroma hits immediately. Very citrusy first flavor, with nice sharp bite to follow. Could be hazier to indicate wheat. Wheat is subservient to the hoppiness...but what do you expect? IMO,at FFF it's this ""arrogance"" that keeps pushing the frontiers of flavor forward.","Highland, Indiana, USA","BATLMULLET"
25,"2003-04-27",3.5,"On tap at 3Floyds: Amber orange in color with a full short-lived eggshell head.  Big floral hoppy aroma, but what did you expect.  Smooth moderately bitter body with a dry piney finish.  Not like many American wheats I've had.  It's a decent beer, but I couldn't taste any wheat in it, and yes I'd also have to say it's over-hopped.  Reminds me too much of Alpha King.  I was hoping for a little more variety of Three Floyds brews.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
25,"2003-04-27",3.3,"On tap at brewery: I would definitely not guessed this an american wheat if Nick hadn't told me.  Amarillo hops just plain overdone and like many of their other beers, too many hops.  I found the malt in this beer being smothered by a high alpha acid hop.  A good beer, but just plain arrogance to keep hopping a style to death.","Washington DC, USA","jskendzel"
25,"2003-04-19",4.4,"Tated at the brewery. This beer deviates from the typical 3F's MO as it is heavy in hop flavor and aroma while light in the bitterness realm.  The amarillo hops provide a very floral and lemon zesty aroma with a similar flavor profile and a subtle grassy overtone.  The beer is light golden in color and has a nice head that maintains throughout the beer.  A very drinkable offering from the Floyds!","Palos Heights, Illinois, USA","EddieG"
