Gushed even after being chilled. luckily, we did not lose any volume. Its a very light yellow appearance with a little darker hues. 4+ finger head but mostly due to a quick pour reaction. The beer has no issue forming bubbles on the swish with sticky white head lacing. 

The aroma has a ton of the natural saison yeast strain notes like pepper, honey, cedar, pine and herbs. 

Really intense bitterness, almost no balance at all and overpowers the malt. Its not intense for double IPA territory but theres certainly this simcoe chinook taste with the herbal saison taste coming through in the finish.

988,"2014-04-14",3.1,"Those wild and hoppy beers are something. Knowingly using a load of aroma hops which are at their best within a few weeks and yet using a wild yeast strain whose repute need no longer be made, it takes time for it to thrive. So what can a poor drinker do if he wont buy a case to run a scientific experiment? Well, hell drink it when he buys it since he got no clue anyways as to when the beer was brewed nor packaged. With this murky blonde, it will appear that the hop has suffered more than the yeast in here, the latter appearing estery fruity, spicy and dusty also. Not particularly wild aroma, but interestingly, the floral and fruity, tropical hop profile intermingles with the yeast own fruitiness in what is probably not a very fresh beer, but manages to feel green anyhow. As the bitterness kicks in toward the end of every sip, an onion and chive-like vegetal feel fumbles with the tongue and detracts from the otherwise enjoyable flavour profile. Dry and gently mineral, assertively carbonated (albeit not the expanding, lovely Belgian type) its supporting pale malts are a pure flow-through, providing but a vehicle in which the hops and yeast reign supreme. As it warms up, it tends to complexify which is usually a trait I enjoy, but I cant say I found much cohesion in here, the dryness heading toward a graphite/pencil shavings borderline astringent direction while the initially spicy yeasty notes pick a smoky phenolic line. The bitterness becomes more clashing and somehow, the whole feels lesser than the sum of the parts. On my palate, not Stillwaters best effort.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

988,"2014-03-30",4.1,"On tap at Baileys Taproom, pours a cloudy yellow with a small white head. Aroma brings out loads of hempy hops, brett, and more weed. Flavour brings out lots of hempy hops, loads of brett, and floral hops. Exceptionally well-balanced - none of the base beer is recognizable at this point. Wonderful stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
988,"2014-03-26",3.7,"Bottle, 03/26/2014. Pours light golden orange, quite hazy, frothy white head with great retention and lacing. Aroma is yeast, grassy herbal bitterness and spice, lovely soft floral citrus, bubblegum, farmhouse character. Taste is fruity Belgian malt character, light lemon, other citrus hop notes with sharper spicy, grassy pine bitterness, funky dry finish, surely the brett coming out a bit. Medium light body, good carbonation. Bitterness kind of overpowering some of the nice hop elements for me, but otherwise nice saison.","New York, USA","jbeatty"

988,"2014-03-07",3.9,"Pours murky golden orange with a soapy white head. The aroma has pineapple, mango, lemony and herbal hop notes. There is some Belgian yeasty fruitiness in there as well and some pale malt hiding in the back. Very inviting aroma. It has a medium body that is on the lush side and has a nice bit of gentle flowing carbonation with a little bit of a bite to it. The flavor starts off very nice with some pine, citrus, tropical fruits from aroma and spicy hops. The Belgian aspect turns more to the earthy type of thing and there is a mineral aspect that integrates well. There is a touch of sweetness from the malt as well. The finish has a touch of sulfur and a nod towards the brett. Im sure the brett will take over and be more prominent down the line, but losing the hops in this might not be worth the trade off. Really well done.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
