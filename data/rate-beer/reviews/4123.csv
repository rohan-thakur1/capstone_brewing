4123,"2017-04-28",4.2,"Pours very dark red. Smell is intense, silky fruit. Like super intensified raspberry-sweetness, very complex and aged ( in a good way ) Taste is very full, sweet, boozy, extremely fruity. Raspberry in aspects, as well as notes of BlackBerry. no idea of how an actual Loganberry tastes like, but this def showcases a very nice flavor ! Perhaps a bit boozy though, but at 14 ABV that was to be expected.","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"

Raspberry, blackberry, red apple, old strawberry, grape most. Lemonade syrup. Very dense but the pure honey is missing a bit in the aroma, very much to the background. Big sweet, tart and dry bitter. Full body, no carbonation. Dry silky and fiercely powerful in aroma. Crazy fruity and dry tannin woody finish. Tongue scraping the bottom of a barrel.","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","sjogro"

Smells good too; top-tier honey alongside notes of raspberry, blueberry, and blackberry. Tastes like it smells, but even more robust, with a pleasantly tart and warming full-bodied mouthfeel.

4123,"2016-12-29",4.6,"Definitely a change of pace from most of the Schramms lineup. The loganberry imparts an earthy flavor that is markedly different from the usual sweet and tart offerings. Also a bit drier than the norm, but not nearly as dry as Black Heart.","","CountPrattula"
4123,"2016-12-29",4.6,"Classic Schramm fruit explosion. A slight tannic tartness. I feel like this will age beautifully and probably get even better similar to Black Heart.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","FrankHammer"

4123,"2016-10-14",4.2,"Leftovers from the Anniversary Party. Pour at the Meadery. The pour is a dark garnet color, with some excellent clarity and legs. The aroma is pretty good. There is a nice sweet berry up front. There is a little more of an alcohol to this than I would expect. The fruit is prominent and its lightly dry. The flavor is much of the same. Great fruitiness, moderate alcohol and a light dry sweetness. The mouth feel is a little thin. It doesnt have the traditional syrup feel to it. The alcohol peeks through a bit more and the aftertaste is dry and fruity. This is pretty good.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
4123,"2016-10-10",4.5,"Pours dark red wine-ish. no carb, no head. it is mead. nose is super rich black raspberries, somehow always the perfect blend between fruitiness and honey sweetness.

4123,"2015-05-22",4.5,"On tap at schramm. Pours a slightly opaque merlot. Aroma of deep, dark fruit. Taste is intense tart Berry, with exceptional balance and a lingering tart, mildly tannic finish. Medium body. Stellar melomel.","New York, USA","tchaos"
4123,"2015-04-30",4.7,"Tap at Schramms. Dark bloody red pour with a tinge of purple. Completely still. Incredible, rich aroma. Black currant, raspberry, earthy honey, and red grape skins. Tastes so rich and sweet but that gets cut by the moderate tartness. Just awesome. Medium to full body. Perfect, slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Tastes like a combo of Black Agnes and Raspberry to me which are two of my favs. This might actually be my favorite from Schramms yet. I really hope these small batches keep coming too.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
4123,"2015-04-29",4.2,"Tap at Schramms. Pours a dark dark red brightened a tad in the light. A few bubbles settle in. Really nice looking. A big dark berry aroma. A tart raspberry right upfront. Really really good. A tart tingle almost like its carbonated yet still soft. A tart and dry finish. Leaves a tingle on the whole mouthfeel. Quite different for me. Great stuff.","Michigan, USA","SpongeRuiner"
4123,"2015-04-26",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 30, 2015 Tap @ Schramms: Bloody purple and dark indigo color; leaves nice legs all over the glass. Huge aroma of tart & tangy blackberry, raspberry, sweet honey, earthy undertones, currant, perfume, & a slight warmth from the alcohol. The flavor... Wow. So damn juicy. Sweet blackberry, plums, raspberry, tart blackcurrant, maybe even a hint of cherry. Sweet up front, then a nice, blunting tartness evolves towards the back-end. Soft perfume & evergreen with a tangy berry flesh finish, almost seedy. Excellent. Ken & crew do it again.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
