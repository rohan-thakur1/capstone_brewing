This is like biting into a fully fresh, juicy peach. Residual sweetness coats the mouth.

4225,"2013-10-15",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 16, 2013 Growler, pour has a peach color but unfortunately there is no carboonation or head to it at all. This was sealed at the brewery with one of those plastic caps with a plastic cone looking thing inside and even with the sender doing a great tape job and everything it still leaked into the bag it came in. Unfortunate they use these crappy cheap caps on such nice beer. Aroma has loads of fresh peach, fruit sweetness, mango, mild underlying saison, and pear juice like in a fruit cocktail. Mouth feel is solid with great coating but there is no carbonation making it feel a bit thicker than it should. Flavor has peach puree, mangos, apricot, rich fruit sweetness, and a hint of yeast that came out towards the end. The fruit side of this is amazing it even gets the pulpy flesh of the fruit into the beer. Light tartness does start to come through once it is fully warmed with a nice lasting finish. This is really a big fruit beer and it is done very well. I am not going to ding the score because this was a shipped growler but how can these guys not know how bad those cheap plastic caps are?","Connecticut, USA","blklab2007"

A - Pours just like a fuzzy peach would look with a very small white head, dissipating down to a thin ring around the edge of the glass, leaving very little lace down the glass.

S - Smells of fresh, ripe peaches from start to finish. Hints of pale malt, spicy yeast and some light sugary sweetness round things out. This one is all about the peaches, making a bit one dimensional in the nose.

T - Starts off with a ton of juicy, ripe peaches that never really fade away. Hints of spicy yeast, pale malt, sugary sweetness and some orange marmalade. Balance of tart to sweet is pretty good from start to finish. Finish is sweet with some lingering dryness, not sticking around for very long.

M - Medium body with moderate to low carbonation. Smooth, sweet feel from start to finish. It goes a touch watery toward the end of the glass.

O - The two year wait was a grueling one but it was worth it, I could drink this beer all day. If you like peaches this is your beer. It is very easy to drink and packs a TON of flavor into a small package. Get some while you can!","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"
4225,"2012-09-23",4.2,"Draft and growler from the brewery. What an absurdly good fruit beer; having had this and their kriek, this little brewery in podunk PA is making some of the best non-sour fruit beer in the world, Id have to say. Cloudy (who wouldve guessed it) peach colored pour with minimal bubbly head. Nose and flavor both bring enticingly complex sweet stone fruit notes, not only the sweet nectary flesh, but also tart skin and pit, almost as if sucking on the pit after the last bite. Touches of bready character mixed in as well. Stunning stuff.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

4225,"2012-01-08",4.0,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2012 A: Peachy/orange/amber. Not surprising! No head, no signs of carbonation or lacing. 

S: Peach juice. Sweet honey. Nothing like farmhouse funk, but inviting nonetheless.

T: Much like the nose, this screams juice. Peach + a tart kick + yeast finish = delicious.

M: Juicy, thick, not much carbonation. Real sweet and tart on the tongue. Missing the dry refreshing quality of saison (although the sweet, juicy refreshing quality aint bad).

O: A unique and top notch brew.

4225,"2010-12-01",3.8,"Picked up a growler of this at Selins a few weeks back.

Pours a somewhat cloudy light apricot color with a white head. Smell is of sweet peaches, very reminiscent of a peach Jolly Rancher with a touch less sweetness. Somewhat one dimensional, but this is one of the things that they do best--great fruit beers that offer up exactly what their name tells you they will. Taste is similar to the nose, although the peach flavor is just a tad bit cloying in these concentrations without much else backing it up. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Very drinkable. Very nice and refreshing during the hotter months.

4225,"2009-10-26",4.2,"Huge thanks to FooFaa for sending such a rare treat my way. Growler poured into my DFH snifter produced a short lasting white head that faded away to nothing. The color of the brew was a wonderful hazy peach/orange.

The aroma of peach is right in your face as you bring the snifter to your mouth. As it warms the funk comes out in the smell as well. The flavor is really complex. Yes it fruity, of course its peach but the tartness of the saison adds a wonderful dimension to the brew. Keeping the sweetness of the peach at bay and making this brew an incredible drinking experience. The feel is my mouth is the light side of medium with a slight carbonation present. Crisp and clean would be a good way to sum it up. 

I will have no problem finishing this growler. The alcohol is light enough to drink a couple of these and it is tasty enough to want to. A great brew that I would love to have again.

Flavors are sweet and extremely fruity, with a very soft, fresh grain background allowing the sweet-tart peach to do dominate. Hints of tart bacteria from the peach skins creep in, intensifying on the semi-dry finish. Medium bodied and sweet, with delicate carbonation, it drinks almost too easily, save for a hint of stickiness. Im not usually a fan of sweet fruit beer, but this one is really well executed.

This is surprisingly very full bodied with a MASSIVE amount of sweet cirsp peach flavor that dominates throughout. The body is creamy and there are some funky tart earthy notes as ell as some peppery spice that provide a nice touch but this beer is all peach. Even though the peach flavor dominates, it is a very organic natural flavor and has none of the artificial syrupy sweetness that generally is found in fruit beers.
