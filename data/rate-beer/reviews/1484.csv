Medium bodied, the texture was a little watery, with soft carbonation, a conglomeration of the aroma notes with no one standing out, and a slightly tart edge to the finish.

Similar flavor. Tug of war between the coffee and cocoa mostly with chocolate in the background.

1484,"2013-02-27",4.2,"Aroma is dominated by freshly roasted coffee with a touch of roasted malt. As the beer warms the chocolate becomes more noticeable but it is a bit one dimensional towards the coffee. 
Pours a dark brown, but not black with light brown highlights on the edges. Light mocha colored head of moderate thickness that recedes steadily to the edges but lingers. Medium lacing with medium low legs. 
Flavor starts with some nice roast and chocolate with a solid coffee character. Mid palate the coffee hits strong but it fades towards the end and blends with a bitter chocolate note in the finish. The bitterness is moderate and the finish has a nice dark chocolate character. 
Mouthfeel is medium full bodied and creamy smooth with medium low carbonation. Low astringency with low alcohol warmth. This is a very smooth, easy drinking coffee porter. 
Overall this beer is very enjoyable. It has a really nice coffee flavor, though a bit strong in the aroma. The oatmeal really helps the creaminess of the mouthfeel.

Smells of nice dark, bold, roasted coffee. Almost an earthy quality to it, but basically like smelling fresh coffee beans. As it warms, get more vanilla qualities. Taste starts very much like it smells: a bold coffee bean flavor, along with tons of roasted qualities and a hefty amount of bitterness as well. Then in the middle, the oatmeal silkiness shows through and smooths it out, along with some sweet vanilla qualities. Then the finish is a nice medley of the bold, roasted coffee bean flavors and the sweet, creamy vanilla notes. Has a pretty full body with a creamy, sticky mouthfeel. Definitely has some porter qualities to it, but is on the verge of a stout. This is right up there with their dirty old man, which is my favorite porter.

The head above isnt there anymore, really...cept a few bubbles clinging to the side of the glass.  The nose reminded my of chocolate rumballs, with an evident layer of coffee, and even some oatmeal cookie.  Flavors combine all that in the nose atop a somewhat silky and oily body..the coffee is the strongest characteristic and seems to linger the longest, the oatmeal is still evident, its not all that sweet though...almost even a bit dry, though there is a chocolatly touch to the coffee entrails.  Carbonation is semi-low, bitterness more a side-effect of the coffee and roasty malts than from the hopping.  Alcohol nicely hidden.

Fantastic coffee stout ""porter"" whatever, doesnt taste like expensive coffee, just vividly translated fresh coffee, one cream and light sugar.  This beer is really up there with Kentucky Breakfast, Peche Mortel, and Beer Geek.  The after-taste is so authentic dinner the morning after going out.

The aroma is big on sweet dark malts and roasted coffee with some chocolate thrown in on top.  There are hints of dark fruit and molasses as well.

The taste is fairly sweet up front with some chocolate malts and that smooth oat flavor.  But the bitter coffee takes over after the sweetness leaving a lingering bitterness through the finish.  Complex and yummy.

Full of black coffee and chewy oatmeal. Some lovely wooden notes underneath too. The oats make it so rich and thick. The flavour is almost identical. Slight hints of alcohol showing and the coffee and oatmeal really go hand in hand with each other. Slight barrelly notes and some huge chalky bitter chocolate. When it all comes together it gives it a bourbon character which I’m sure becomes pretty fierce in the Over A Barrel version. The finish is a big assault of everything all at one settling on some luscious and lengthy American chocolate. Strange mouthfeel.

I can smell some vanilla and espresso before I even lift the glass; when I get it to my nose, I get a seriously heavy molasses aroma, minimal chocolate, some ashiness, and a hint of an herb Im having trouble placing (sage?). The flavor has obvious coffee right off... a slightly tart roast, probably a Latin American bean. That is followed by molasses, wood, and prune. A tiny hint of vanilla bounces around once in a while. There is some herbal bitterness that dries out the finish, and gives it a little bit of a whisky impression. Pretty good beer.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"

1484,"2008-02-16",4.1,"Bottle pours black with no head, just a small surface ring.  You can get a head out of this by spinning the beer around in a tulip.  It then produces a nice milk chocolate head that leaves lace spots.  The aroma is very roasted, almost charred, camp fire smoke, tobacco shop, bitter coffee, and bitter chocolate.  The flavor is coffee like, molasses, lactic, faint ale fruit characteristics, and obvious bitter chocolate.  The palate is velvet rich and coating.  There seems to be a lingering bitterness that does not distract - I am a coffee lover too.  More oatmeal characteristics as it warms.  Drink this cold to start, and take your time - as it warms you get so much more...  This is very good.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"

Flavor, on the other hand, was a real knock up in my rating. Still, silky pour with no head and barely any bubbles. Roasty milk chocolate aroma with lots of coffee and cream. Chewy palate that coats the tongue with malty mocha goodness and a lasting oatmeal presence with substantial hops to balance it out. Great mouthfeel!","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"

Maybe a little too much, but still delightful. Intense flavors of coffee, chocolate malts with just enough hops. Thick and rich is an understatement. This is like drinking a milkshake in a pint glass. Leaves you wanting another. This is one outstanding brew! Right up there with Founders Breakfast Stout as far as quality for the flavor profile.

Massive, slightly burnt, fresh ground coffee bean nose, chocolaty with something like a chocolate chip cookie dough aroma. Sweet coffee flavors, like someone put about a teaspoon too much sugar into your cuppa joe (at least for my coffee). Roasty and chocolaty, a hint of dough.

The aroma was baking chocolate, light smoke, some coffee and even some earthy dryness, perhaps it was the oatmeal?  The flavor had a pronounced lean towards the dry oatmeal and coffee, with the chocolate popping in occassionally to say hi.  The mouthfeel was nice enough but overall this beer doesnt keep pace with something like Breakfast Stout.  Above average, not great.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","Soonah"

The aroma shows rich, roasty coffee with cream, accompanied by chocolate malts and moderate, earthy hop bitterness.  The flavor follows suit, with coffee being the star attraction.  Im not a coffee lover, but this is an awesome brew.  Theres just enough chocolate sweetness to balance out the intensely roasty coffee profile.  The oatmeal element adds incredible smoothness and drinkability.  The medium-full mouthfeel is just a little over carbonated, with fizzy bubbles intensifying the bitter coffee finish.  Reminds me alot of Terrapin Wake-N-Bake, though note quite as huge.  Very solid brew.  Worthy of its lofty rating.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

I usually dont like oatmeal as an ingredient, but its musty funk is counterbalanced here by the ""imperial"" and coffee aspects, which are easily discernable.

The Devil Made Me Do It poured a black hole into my snifter. This beer does not let one bit of light shine through. I think its actually making the room darker. A 1 finger tan head formed and quickly fell to a thick ring of head with a floating island of chunk. Leaves chunky lacing after each sip. This is one of those beers that looks like itll be packed with flavor. 

This beer smells great. Mounds of the finest freshly ground coffee beans greet the nose. Roasted malts are there along with a shot of cream and 2 cubes of sugar. Smells like a quality freshly brewed cup of coffee.

Again, a freshly brewed cup of coffee as soon as this beer hits the tongue. Mild vanilla and cream add a nice sweetness that accompanies the coffee perfectly. Moderate coffee bitterness on the swallow thats always welcome.

Creamy mouthfeel from the addition of oatmeal. Actually has a little prickliness in there that awakens the tongue and really lets the flavors take hold.

This is a highly drinkable beer. I can see myself drinking this anytime of the day whether its with breakfast or after dinner.

Tyranena makes some great beers and this is no exception. A porter thats missing the porter aspect and filled with roasty delicious coffee.

Morning nose of sweet roasted espresso-like coffee and oatmeal waffles; some black malt, burnt chocolate cookies, and a tiny bit of peppery spice. Very attractive nose to this one.

Taste is refined within a terrific draw of pale black malt sweetness, whole grain cereal, and a lot of chocolate enduced coffee roastedness right upfront; then spent milk rounds off with a creamy center, and a lovely little hop note spicing up the back end with leftover returns of coffee and chocolate. The bitterness is perfectly fitting within the roasted character all the way through, which makes this one heavenly yummy treat and a great drinker. Nice mix of chocolate and coffee parts.

Body is mediumish to full with an extended creamyness that plays well with what roasted and bitter notes tend to keep on sticking on the palate. Chocolate milk spikes with a nice rounded coffee really takes the whole thing and puts it together once its sat a while. Which isnt long, cuz this stuff is a real treat to behold and drink down.

Some gentle swirling rejuvenates the creamy topping, but it dissipates more quickly than desired.  Tons of coffee in the aroma, which imparts a borderline smoky, ashy character.  A little bit of toasted oats and dark chocolate malt add a bit of enjoyable complexity, but the coffee mostly dominates.  Medium bodied, creamy carbonated mouthfeel.  Tons of coffee greets the palate, but it has a smooth flavor that doesnt present any harsh, bitter, tannic, or burned flavors that often accompany coffee additions.  Great silky texture.  The coffee flavors give way to some creamy dark chocolates and an almost milky flavor.  Long lasting finish of subtly smooth chocolate flavors.

The aroma has notes of coffee, burnt malts, some toasted bread, chocolate, oatmeal, and grassy hops. The taste pretty much follows suit with rich sweet flavors of pumpernickel bread and bittersweet mocha over an espresso and smoked ham. The finish is more smoke and coffee...on and on...leads to a mouth feel that is more akin to porter, thin and watery, not a noticeable amount of oats IMO.

The aroma is of heavily roasted coffee, bitter chocolate, burnt malt, oats, chalk, and a hint of alcohol.  Kinda like fresh espresso grounds.  The coffee, roast, and oatmeal really work well together.  Aggressive moderately bitter espresso smoothed out with the oats finishing with a slight burnt ashiness and a touch of sweetness.  Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with a smooth velvety texture and light fine carbonation.  This was very nice.  Similar in alot of ways to Meantime Coffee.

Tastes of vanilla, coffee (although not as strong as the aromas but definitely there), roast, burnt malts, oats, and chocolate.

1484,"2007-04-07",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 1, 2013 4/05/2007:  ""The Devil Made Me Do It"" is an ""Imperial Oatmeal Porter with Coffee Beans"" that is near glack in color, opaque, and has a brown crown.  It looks thick from based on the pour.  The aroma is expensive coffee with some rich chocolate around the edges.  Dark chocolate, coffee, mocha, and cream round out the rich and robust flavor.  The alcohol is well integrated into the overall flavor.  My wife really seemed to enjoy this beer as well.  She took three drinks one right after another (which is unheard of) and proclaimed ""This is really good!""  I had to take it away from her before she drank it all!  The body is full and quite thick.  It feels smooth and creamy in the mouth.  Overall, this is an excellent beer.  It can easily hold its own against the other great coffee and breakfast stouts out there.  Tyranena definitely knows how to make excellent, unique, and memorable brews.

12/07/2010:  Tyranena The Devil Made Me Do It! Coffee Imperial Oatmeal Porter...  Aroma:  Intense darkly roasted espresso with a smooth chocolate-y sweetness that takes off the coffee edge.  Appearance:  Murky, ultra-dark cola brown color; pours silky smooth without much carbonation; thin, but dense tan-colored crown.  Flavor:  Semi-sweet and dark chocolate with a slash of high-text espresso; nice roasty coffee bean and accompanying bitterness in the middle (similar to the experience of sucking on a dark-roasted coffee bean) that is tempered quite a bit by oatmeal; short, but bold finish with a nice lingering sweet coffee aftertaste; quite a bit of dark chocolate comes out as the beer warms.  Palate:  Full-bodied; oily and ultra smooth; milky texture, but doesnt feel heavy.  Overall:  DAMN GOOD and still holding well despite the age; an excellent example of how both a coffee beer and an oatmeal beer should be!

1484,"2007-04-06",3.5,"Aroma is great. Subtle coffee and oat characteristics that arent overbearing. Looks great with a slight tan head. Lacing all the way down, for what its worth. Flavor was good, and alcohol well-hidden, but was quite thin. Tasted like oatmeal and coffee soda. Hints of oaky vanilla and mild nuttiness are there, but are overshadowed by the coffee. Not a complaint, seeing as how I CRAVE coffee and the bottle describes this beer as such. Just a tad simplistic. Medium carbonation and silky smooth going down. Well-balanced, but a little weak for a beer rated so high, IMO. Very drinkable and enjoyable but not terribly complex. Would definitely drink this quite often if given the opportunity, but Ill settle for trading for it every now and again.","Blowing Rock, North Carolina, USA","BleacherBum"

First taste is of mayan chocolate.  The oatmeal comes very close to counteracting the astringency of the old coffee taste but fails at this.  Palate is like silk draped over a bed of nails.

I wish this was more than a special release.  This was probably the best BGW release to date; if I had the cellar room I would go buy another four pack to have some for the future.  Still, if they can make something this then I am pretty sure they can do it again.  If you happen to come across this be sure to snap it up.  This is one of those beers that will grab your attention and not let go until the bottle has been empty for fifteen minutes.
Aroma / Appearance - The black body was smothered by a one finger head the color of cardboard.  Thick sheets of lacing clung to the sides of my snifter as I took sips leaving behind a history of the levels.  The nose was very rich with a first impression of raisins and oatmeal.  Further reflection revealed straight black coffee, smoky bacon and dark rich chocolate.  A milky backbone holds it all together.
Flavor / Palate - The taste of fluid oatmeal coated my throat on the first sip along with straight black coffee.  Raisins, rich chocolate and oreos dipped in low fat milk form the second wave of flavors.  Leathery wood tastes come towards the middle with oats very strong throughout.  The finish of smoked bacon and malty coffee completes an excellent experience overall.  This reminds me of a hybrid baltic porter moreso than a straight porter.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1484,"2007-03-25",3.5,"Somewhat opaque dark brown pour, ruby highlights. Fully and quickly diminishing dark tan head. Leaves a beige ring at the edge of the glass. Minor lacing. Aroma is mostly coffee. I wouldnt go so far as to say this immediately feels one dimensional, but near overwhelming coffee certainly inhibits easy clarification and identification of subtle malt nuances. Some chocolate and moderate roastiness are noticeable, hazelnuts and a sour milk note on the back end as well. The coffee in the aroma does smell good. Quite a bit more balance comes in the flavor. Still very heavy coffee. The combination of that with big roasty chocolate tastes simulates an interesting peanut butter note. I feel like every sip taken brings me closer to being so awake my eyeballs dry out because Im too alert to blink. This would be fantastic at 9 a.m. in the board room. Finishes roasty and very dry with slight sugariness. Palate is bubbly, sticky, medium to full bodied, with a sweet/dry balance until a very dry climax at the bitter end.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Tyranena seems to have the most memorable and savory aromas that my nose has had the pleasure of inhaling.  If I keep sniffing this beer Im going to turn in the Afrin Man.   Taste does not disappoint with the coffee flavors forging ahead amongst all the flavors.  Im picking up some chocolate, milk sugars, roasted malt and a nice fruity, almost cherry like taste thats very subtle but shows up in the finish.

It will be interesting what some aging will do to it.","Eau Claire, Wisconsin, USA","buckybeer"
1484,"2007-02-20",3.8,"Low hiss as the cap comes off, pouring as translucent and mahogany, yet mostly opaque and chestnut black in the glass. A sparse tan moss head transforms into mocha edges and tan sawdust on top. Depth defying nose drums with espresso beans dipped in blackened, lactic dark chocolate. Campfires catch smores off guard and emanate an admirable sweet and burnt aromatic fulfillment. Unrefined bakers bricks and caramel scorched in the kettle pull up the rear. Heavy smashed mocha beans slow down in the mouth to a chewy, dark chocolate tune. Broiled fudge bake gets cemented with an espresso bottom. Charred oats meet singed smore sticks several moments after the marshmallow is lost, but the sweetness still retains a glimpse of the dark, Swiss chocolate filler. Balance favors the bean, but the burnt turtle fudge surrounding it gives enough caramel sweetness to keep it on kilter. Lactic, burnt café de cacao and dense chocolate mouse cling to classic coffee characteristics in the end.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"
1484,"2007-02-20",3.9,"The coffee is rough, raw, and uneven yet well mashed oatmeal adds silky smoothness. Hint of liccorice. More carbonation would help.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","chimpscampee"
1484,"2007-02-16",4.2,"Deep black with a thin tan film of a head.  Aroma is loaded with coffee and dark chocolate.  Flavor is lots more coffee with a bit of cereal sweetness, semi-sweet chocolate and a nice bitter hops bite.  The finish is long and roasty and stays with you for a while.  Heavy on the palate even with more carbonation than I expected, very satisfying.  The two best things to happen to Wisconsin micros is New Glarus unplugged series and Tyranenas brewers gone wild.","Wisconsin, USA","twindadplus2"
1484,"2007-02-14",3.7,"Near black color with a small lid of dark tan bubbles. Looks like a rather silky pour. First sniff certainly does not hold anything back, with big coffee, oatmeal and lightly burnt caramel. While I like coffee, I still have not hopped upon the coffee brew wagon. The aroma does settle to a thick espresso, but still I am not persuaded. Nice smooth feel that is a touch biting in the finish. Caramel malt, start with a abrupt change of pace when the coffee flavors hit mid sip. A return to dark and roasted malts in the finish and linger. For some reason I feel I just dumped some instant coffee into my oatmeal. Coffee and porter/stout lovers will likely rave about this one. For me, a fine brew, but once again, not my cup of joe.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"
1484,"2007-02-14",3.8,"12oz bottle i believe only a few weeks young. pours very dark with nice tan head. nose is gushing with stale coffee left cold over night and undertones of oatmeal. flavor notes of chocolate and oats that quickly evolves into a lot of stale coffee. youd think the taste the stale coffee wouldnt be good but it actually is! the coffee and hops provide quite a bit of bitterness too. mouthfeel is not very thick but full bodied. carbination is a tad high. alcohol is well hidden. this really is a tasty coffee porter but far from perfect.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
1484,"2007-02-14",4.1,"12 oz bottle sampled from drewbeerme.  The aroma is completely coffee, maybe theres a hint of malt in there but its almost all coffee and stale coffee left on the burner at that.  Mmm, I love it.  Coffee dominates the tongue as well but with some nice sweetness, milkyness, and a little chocolate.  Silky medium thick body, I can really taste and feel all the oats that went into it.  Very nice, Ill have to get some more of this and continue to rerate.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","holdenn"

1484,"2007-02-09",4.5,"Bottled.  Poured a lovely shade of extra-deep brown with an initial creamy cap of beige head that receded after a couple minutes.  Nose was heavy on the deeply-roasted, excellent coffee blend with sweeter milk chocolate appearing intermittently... coffee steals the show and is damn good!  The flavor department does the aroma justice!... with deeply-roasted coffee disseminating brilliantly across the palate.. and perfectly-aligned oat and milk chocolate sweetness to balance the coffee bitterness.. Slightly oily and heavier-bodied on the palate, with an ideal level of coffee bitterness and a satisfying warm finish.  As an added bonus, I could feel the caffeine kick in after a couple sips!  Magnificent!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1484,"2007-02-05",4.8,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2007 On Tap.  Dark color.  Smell of fresh coffee grounds,  spice, vanilla, malt, chocolate and hints of hops and caramel.  Taste of fresh roasted coffee.  I can actually taste two different coffee beans in my mouth with every sip.  Also can taste coco, malt, hops, milk, little bit of smoke, and hints of caramel.  Nice and creamy and warms your insides up.  Dry, sweet bitterness at the end. Can hardly taste the alcohol and its even better when its warms up.  I love the strong coffee smell and taste.  Much better than Bells Java and Founders Breakfast!  Great job Rob!","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","KingpinIPA"
1484,"2007-02-03",4.4,"From bottle obtained on tapping night. Aroma is a huge mist of coffee bean,somewhat different then other coffee brews,probaly due to use of exotic sumatra and Costa Rican coffee beans,aroma is enhanced with touchs of chocolate cake batter and charcoal,head is virtually non existant, taste is bitter bakers chocolate, vanilla, a touch of maple sweetness all masterly blended with a wonderful and unique coffee flavor,ends with a teasing mild hop finish. Carbonation is low but evident, which along with the oatmeal gives it a creamy slick finish. More medium then full bodied, so you could enjoy more then one at a sitting ;coffee seems to be the flavor of this winter,and this is one of the best.
