162,"2017-05-26",4.4,"Bottle from Consumers Beverage. This ones reputation precedes it. Excellent throughout. Near black pour with tight, creamy beige head, leaves rings of lacing all the way down.

162,"2017-05-07",4.0,"Was finally able to snag a bottle of this while on a recent trip up North, brought it home to SC and currently enjoying this outside on a beautiful cool spring afternoon. This exceptional rendition of a classic American porter pours a dark brown-black color with translucent highlights of ruby-brown, and has a bright off-white khaki head. Lots of foam and bubbles at the top but not as much lacing from this bottle. Regardless, this brew releases a fresh roasty chocolate malt aroma with notes of wood smoke and mocha. Flavor features a dark slightly smokey cocoa and coffee bean maltiness along with a mild but recognizable northwest hoppy bitterness, and finishes with a bittersweet dark chocolate taste. A hint of vanilla was also present. The hoppiness is clean and herbal, which distinguishes this from the more earthy hops of this brews London porter cousins. This beer has a surprisingly light-medium body given the complexity of the flavor, distinctly smooth and refreshing on the palate for a porter. A great example of balanced drinkability with complexity, light enough to drink casually but sophisticated enough to sip and savor. I would love to find this one again, would be a go-to porter for me if only there was the availability down south.","South Carolina, USA","eRock_2013"

Its well balanced, possesses simple complexity (oxymoron, yeah but its an apt description), and immensely flavorful and drinkable.

Conclusion: The old EF was smooth and drinkable with a subtle licorice note; 5.8% abv. Very nice! The new EF is a robust, roasted brew with a slight coffee note 6% abv. Very nicer!

162,"2015-04-22",3.9,"BBD 7/14/15. Pours a beautiful deep dark ruby that approaches black. Outstanding head volume and retention, world class lacing.

Rich nose of dark chocolate over a rich caramel malt base with a touch of roast.

Light medium body with a smooth texture that lacks creaminess. Above normal carbonation with a nice burst of effervescence in the middle and a prickly finish.

The flavor profile is less intense than expected, a bit complex and very well balanced. It begins with a slight bakers chocolate flavor that flows into a mild herbal bitterness in the middle. The richness of the nose never expresses itself. Roast appears in the middle - finish transition. Caramel never really becomes significant. The finish is a slow fade of roast and herbal hops.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

A: Pours a deep, dark brown, but clear enough to see through. What little head forms is thin and quickly dissipates, though the beer leaves nice lacing on the glass for a moment ere it slides back into the liquid. 

S: Slightly smoky dark roasted coffee and 90%+ dark chocolate riding a charred grain malt aroma, with some hints of sweetness around the edges.

T: Oh, thats malty. Dark, charred roasted grain, deliciously bitter, with the black roasted coffee and extra-dark chocolate notes clearly present. There are some hints of campfire smoke and cherry wood, or at least the flavor I get off of meat smoked over cherry wood. The finish is a deeply satisfying bitter roasted grain.

162,"2014-08-01",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 8-28-12 - 
 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  Served a deep brown color with a small off white head. The head fades rather fast to give only a light amount of lacing.

 Smell  The aroma is a wonderful mix of roasted malt and chocolate as well as a light caramel sweetness. With these aromas is a very light dark fruit aroma of plum and raisin as well. Overall the aroma is nice and sweet.

 Taste  The taste begins with nice roasted malt and some slightly bitter coffee notes. As the taste advances a sweeter chocolate flavor greets the tongue. The chocolate is soon complemented with some dark fruit as well as caramel flavors. These sweeter caramel and dark fruit flavors last to the end, but there they end up fading, resulting, in the end, a nice semi-sweet cocoa flavor that is left to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel The body of the brew was on the average to slightly above average side with a carbonation level that was on the slightly lower side. While the body was lighter then would have been nice for the roasty and cocoa flavors, the carbonation was right on par. While the body was lighter, when complemented with the carbonation and smooth flavors, it did make for a very easy drinking porter.

 Overall - A tasty brew with some nice roasty and chocolate flavors. Easy drinking and good.","","Darkmagus82"

Well, this beer pours with a great tan head, dark brown in color. When held up to a light I can barely see through it.
Good head rentention, very good actually and excellent lacing.
Rich malts provide a complex aroma. I can pick out cofee and espresso and chocolate from the roasted malts.
This porter is smooth and rich in flavor, what you smell is what you get baby.
Coffee and espresso up front with a nice chocolate finish.
A good cooking beer for stews and chili.

It has notes of caramel with a strong dark roasted malt presence that has a deep roasted espresso character. Its flavor has deep chocolate roasted malts with flavor notes of coffee and cream with bittersweet chocolate. The hops play well off the malt and further develop the bittersweet chocolaty flavors before slowly fading out into the finish. The palate is smooth, creamy and slightly slick with mild carbonation and a medium to full body. Outstanding.

162,"2014-06-05",4.3,"Oh good grief. Ive never rated this and Ive had this more than enough times in my life. Well, no time like the present to do this.
Almost always, this has been poured into a pint glass. I honestly cant think of anytime Ive ever had this in any other vessel.
The appearance was a nice dark brown close to black color with a nice tan/white one finger foamy white head. This head lasts for a good minute before it gently dies. Once it dies, theres a nice speckled lacing sticking finely to the glass.
The smell had a nice balanced allocation of coffee to chocolate malts, dry yet somewhat bitter and still even a decent sweetness all combining very nicely.
The taste was bitter, yet dry, still a decent sweet and bringing in a nice roasty sort of flavoring. The aftertaste was mainly a dry coffee with still a slight chocolate coming in. There was a nice dry finish.
On the palate, it sat about a light to medium in body with a decent sessionable quality about it. The carbonation finishes somewhat smooth surrounding my mouth and tongue.
Overall, I say this is an absolutely excellent American Porter, more than worthy of having again. Kudos to whoever lives in the distro for this excellent beer and kudos to Great Lakes for making an absolutely excellent brew.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

The coffee and bakers chocolate notes are apparent from the nose on this, and come right through from the first sip. There is a reassuringly medium body here - with appropriate carbonation.

162,"2014-01-09",3.7,"The beer pours a dark, coffee brown with a small head of medium sized, tan bubbles and a middling retention. In body, the beer appears clear but nearly opaque from its darkness, slight hints of ruby and garnet can be seen when held to the light, but no particles seem to be present. On the nose, the beer smells of toasted oatmeal bread, rich caramel sauce, soft burnt popcorn, and fresh coffee beans moving into instant coffee mix. Light dark chocolate can be sensed from time to time in the nose, but the overall impression is of instant coffee, toast, and caramel sauce. On the tongue, the beer tastes smoothly sweet with a nice roasted bitter finish. Just a touch of acidity and a little hop bitters can be sensed in the beer towards the finish. In flavor, the beer begins as burning caramel sauce, working into light roast coffee, caramel malt, and a touch of herbal bitter hops. Light burnt popcorn flavors can also be sensed. The finish is of a middling length and is herbal bitters mingling with burnt black malt, touches of coffee, and just a hint of dark chocolate. The aftertaste is nearly non-existent. In the mouth, the beer feel on the light side of full-bodied, with a very smooth, silky mouthfeel that is just gently chewy. Carbonation is middling with a soft prickly scrub on the palate. The mouth is left a little wet with saliva but only a soft astringency on the tongue, and little else. Overall, this is a nice porter. I could put a couple of these back on a cold winters day and be happy, and this would pair very nicely with a thick stew or shepherds pie. Its not my favorite in the style, honestly, but I think that is because it is so classically a porter that it doesnt stand out much to me.

Delicious! Its just as delectable in the mouth, with a complex, dark, charred wood-like flavor thats soft and a little reminiscent of cocoa powder mixed with coffee grounds. As complex and dark as it sounds, its very easy on the palate, well-dosed with alcohol and body to offer one of the most balanced, deep, and enjoyable standard porters out there. It finishes slightly dry, with coffee, cocoa powder, and something that reminds me of figs. This is really delightful and very well-done.","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

162,"2013-11-18",4.4,"Pours almost black but has an edge allows you to observe a crimson hue. The beer has impeccable clarity and when held to the light you can see the stream of bubbles rising in the center of the glass. Fat tan head of foam that falls well and leaves sheets of lace to fall back down into the beer as you drink. The suds refresh with each tip of the glass. 

Nose is brilliant. Sophisticated roasted malt. Blackened, bready, but not crusted or burned. Toasted perfectly smooth. It has a the light scent of creamy caramel. A light touch of brown sugar, bold espresso that is smoothed out by dark bittersweet chocolate. It has a cookie like dryness even on the nose and a light and delicate hop herbal. 

Taste is sensational. The malt rolls out of the glass, supple, creamy, like velvet. Soft and graceful. The caramel stays light and lightly sweet with a bit of nut to it and that sweet little bit of cream to fill up the palate. The coffee and the dark chocolate gives it oomf and a burly quality that is very dynamic. It finishes dry and with an endless grain. The hop herbal balances this perfectly for an aftertaste that is filled with soft dark bread. The body of the beer is medium and it approaches chewy but stays just shy of it. It has a little bit of thickness and it feels great on the palate. 

This beer has a radiant and strikingly handsome appearance. The nose is dapper and full of rich deep scents. The taste is smart and it dazzles with its depths and with its light sweetness. Engaging. Simply one of the best porters.","New York, USA","pinkie"

162,"2013-03-20",4.3,"Ordered on-tap at Olives in Roseville, MI.

Appearance: A pretty perfect looking porter. Pitch black color. A beautiful little head on it. Great lacing throughout the glass. 

Smell: Not bad, not great. I didnt get much. It sort of is similar to the taste, but more muted.

Taste: Easily the best porter Ive had. I havent had many, but I HAVE had Founders Porter, and this trumps that without question. Theres almost a slight earthy flavor upfront, with that great, to-be-expected coffee and chocolate flavor through the rest of the sip. Really great.

Mouthfeel: Probably because I had it on tap, but creamy and delicious, like a good porter should be.

Overall, one of the best beers Ive had, period. I drank this with FISH AND CHIPS and loved every last drop of it. Theres really nothing bad to be said about Edmund Fitzgerald, but it does have me wondering. Why does ""Great Lakes Brewing Company"" exist in OHIO when they have ONE Great Lake bordering their state? Also, the Edmund Fitzgerald sunk in Lake Superior -- a Great Lake nowhere near Ohio.

Equal portions of vanilla, chocolate, and coffee in the nose along with faint accents of dried fruit and toasted hazelnuts. Opaque brown-black under a lasting, thin, light brown cover. Grainy vanilla and mocha flavour with a prominent sweetness complemented by a sweet, warming alcohol. A dark chocolate bitterness is there but balance is toward the sweet. Toasted hazelnuts come in late and this complex, sweet and grainy brew finishes relatively dry. Seems way bigger than only 5.8% abv. Full body, medium carbonation, surprisingly clean finish.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","asheft"

A: Pours a dark brown body betrayed by its ruby red edges near the glass. It also features a three finger light mocha colored head with a nice frothy texture and spots of decent lacing.

S: Chocolate, roasted malt, dark fruit, coffee, brown sugar, and a touch of earth. Really fantastic; proof that an excellent smelling beer doesnt need to be in your face to impress.

T: This is a porter that eschews boldness for subtlety, and its all the better for it. An initial wave of chocolate hits the tongue, followed by notes of coffee, roast, smoke, raisin, hazelnut; while the finish sees a return of the coffee notes along with a slight noble hop component. Finish lasts a long time, as well. One of the more complex porters Ive had, yet all of the notes in the flavor profile are balanced with one another. Only real flaw is that mine was served a bit too warm, and it negatively affected the flavor slightly; course its not like it really matters...

Aroma is of bitter/semi-sweet chocolate with french roast coffee and toasted nut of some sort.  Maybe even a bit of maduro cigar.  Its robust but not overpowering.

Its a pretty dark brown beer.  Very little light comes through.  Starts with a brownish head that dissipates fast.  Very little but nice lacing.

Taste mirrors the aroma except its more bitter.  Besides the chocolate and coffee being the main tastes coming through, there definitely is a bit of toasted nut and maybe weirdly enough, even a bit of oyster.

Its medium bodied and has some decent carbonation.  It has a slightly more bitter finish than I am used to for a porter.

162,"2012-02-28",4.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 12/8/2010.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

Black mixed with walnut brown color with a ruby tint, not really much light escaping through here. A nice creamy tan head forms with the pour. 
The lace lingers a few centimeters above the beer level and inches its way down.

Milk chocolate, caramel, and roasted coffee dominate the nose.

 The milk creamy sweetness starts out the flavor by combining sweet caramel, a latte like espresso flavor, and some roasted malt. A kick of spice and herbal hops impart a light hoppy bite. The finish keeps a good part of the coffee, cream, and herbal hop flavors.

Creamy smoothness and carbonation with a full body. Although the start is very creamy, the feel becomes more dry toward the end.

mouthfeel. I think the reason it was more like cocoa powder then chocolate is because the beer seems a bit watery. Just goes down real easy, hard not to just make this dissapear in a quick few minutes. hankered down to let er warm a bit.

162,"2011-01-02",3.8,"Porters have always been safe bets for me, but none have really knocked my socks off. Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter, however, comes awfully close. This is a beer with the lighter body of a porter, but the robustness of a stout. APPEARANCE AND AROMAI poured a 12oz bottle into an English nonic pint glass. The body appears to be black, but is actually dark ruby red. It initially forms a generous, dark tan, soapy head - which dissipates slowly and leaves a little lacing on the glass.The aroma is quite inviting with roasted malts, coffee, dark chocolate, oatmeal, and what I like to call ""a dairy scent most stouts and porters seem to have.""TASTEBefore I came to appreciate craft beer and especially stouts and porters, I always found beers like this to have a ""cough medicine-like"" taste. Drinking Edmund Fitzgerald I can still find that flavor, but now I rather enjoy it. That taste is a combination of roasty malts and a sweetness of chocolate. Not that this is chocolate beer per se, but there definitely is a confectionary flavor to be found here.The first half of the beer is rather mild, but the second half is quite robust. Whereas most American porters tend to have just a hint of chocolate and coffee on the finish, they are very overt here. Theres not much bitterness to speak of, and certainly no lazy hops hanging around on my tongue afterwards. The coffee-like taste and bitterness is only momentary and the aftertaste is short and sweet (literally). However, this tidy finish is actually what prevents Ed Fitz from being a great beer since its so enjoyable while its in the mouth you want more.DRINKABILITYThe porter has been a ""working mans beer"" for centuries, and this beer definitely follows the mold. For such a seemingly strong palate, it has a very thin, light mouthfeel. It also seems to be more highly carbonated than most porters, to point of having a soda-like sensation. At 5.8% ABV, Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is something of an all-purpose beer. It would probably work best as a pub beverage, but I could see this pairing with meals that dont have a lot of spice. It would also work well as a session beer, or an after-dinner liquid dessert.FINAL THOUGHTSIve yet to encounter a porter I would consider an amazing beer, but Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald comes very close to that title. I enjoy its good taste, and the easy drinkability seals the deal. At $8.49 for a six-pack its also a fantastic bargain in the craft beer world and could entice some Joe and Jane Six Packs to give it a try.NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwYa5C6TSpE","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

162,"2010-07-09",4.2,"Over the past months, Great Lakes has skyrocketed to one of my favorite breweries. Everything that they make is just of an unbelievable quality. The Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is no exception. Its everything that a porter should be: dark, rich chocolaty sweetness with a bitter aftertaste akin to coffee. Its just an orgasmic explosion of all of my favorite flavors, and the key to Great Lakes success in their rendition of the porter is that they nail the balance of these flavors exquisitely. The first thing I notice when I sip one is that sweetly sparse flavor of dark chocolate, which quickly gives way to a bite of iced coffee. If you let a single swig go unaccompanied for too long, there is a twinge of unpleasant bitterness, but otherwise its titties in a bottle. The only better porters out there that Ive tried are Bells, and quite possibly Hoppys.","West Virginia, USA","FuryHUH"
162,"2010-07-07",3.2,"12 oz. bottle, consumed on 7-6-10. Sharp aroma of dark chocolate, roasted coffee been, crystalized brown sugar, caramel, and toffee. Pours a dark brown (though not as dark as somer porters) with a ruby hue. Clear liquid. Moderate amount of even, thin, beige/tan head. Produces good lacing. Dark roasted malts dominate the flavor. Some chocolate, but the coffee taste is too strong for me, someone who cant stand coffee. Milky taste develops eventually. Dry, bitter aftertaste. Light to medium body. Soft in the palate. Highly drinkable in terms of palate effects, though the sometimes unpleasant flavor doesnt help matters. Edmund Fitzgerald seems well made, but the problem for me is that its a porter (i.e., Im not a fan of the style). Oh well.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

162,"2010-05-23",3.8,"Appearance: Ruby highlights flow through a dark brown body with a light mocha head with fair retention and nice lacing.

Smell: what a nose...can you say coffee and chocolate all the way? well edmund fitzgerald porter can and does.

Taste: Lucuious tasting roasted malt, coffee, and chocolate blended to perfection. Really the best tasting porter I have had so far. Not overly bitter either which is nice. But of the bitterness that it does have, dont be fooled into thinking it all comes from the coffee / chocolate flavors. There is a definite hop bite in the finish which is really well done.

Mouthfeel: Actually a bit thin in my opinion but not to the point where it ruins the brew in any way. I just think this is an area for improvement.

Drinkability: excellent nose and taste combined with a slightly thin mouthfeel equals easy drinking!

Hats off to Great Lakes Brewing...

The subtle aroma has a nice variety of roasted malts and nuts, a indistinct hop presence, and minor mocha. Nothing mind blowing there, but still quite pleasant.

Again, nice  roasted malts mixed with nuts, caramel, light mocha, and a earthy hop. Even though theres not a lot of distinct hop qualities here, its still well balanced.

Palate: Medium-full bodied beer with a long finish, smooth

Overall Impression:
My first Great Lakes beer (but not my last...Thanks, Justin!)  This is a tasty beer for sure.  I like the addition of a bit more hops then are standard for this style to the traditional porter flavors that you find in this beer.  Nice amount of body, nice taste, nice from start to finish, a nice beer, that I think is rated very accurately.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

Smell is a good strong toffee scent, a light hint of chocolate, and a roasty coffee smell. Excactly what I want from this style.

Taste/Mouth - The beer is carbonated just right and meduim bodied, with the beer seemingly going through distinct phases of taste as it coats the palate. Opens up robust and roasty and then finishes with a creamy/coffee/chocolatey aftertaste.

Drinkability is very good. I dont see why this wouldnt be a perfect session beer.

There is also a bit of a hop flower presence in the aroma.

This ship smells of cocoa powder, coffee grounds, dark fruit and a definite hoppiness. Upon tasting its very light yet bold in flavor. Starts with dry cocoa powder, an oakiness follows and then malt.

162,"2009-08-04",3.9,"He poured deep brown-black into my glass and almost billowed over in a frothing explosion of dark tans and feisty bubbles. As he starts to settle into his new surroundings, deep amber sap can be seen glinting around the edges and bottom while his cover sticks like glue. Wafting my way are those oh-so decadent aromas of cocoa beans, coffee grinds fresh from the grinder, oak and smoke, nutmeg and cinnamon, maple drizzled raisin bread, dark chocolate powder, bakers chocolate, and chocolate covered coffee beans. Yeah, I think that covers everything; quite a bit to take in at once, but I am certainly not complaining. Judging from the plethora of dry aromas and oak, I expect a fairly dry palate and I am not disappointed. His body is rather light, balanced by a dry body of wood, powdered dark and bakers chocolates, and ground espresso. A faint smoky presence slowly permeates the palate and lingers in each breath. Balancing his dry personality is sweet maple drizzled atop warm raisin bread while cinnamon and nutmeg sprinkles give him spice. Crunchy, bitter and sweet chocolate covered coffee beans snap and pop atop my tastebuds as some licorice root compliments further notes of oak with the smoke continuing to subtly permeate. Lip-smacking, thirst-quenching, drool-inspiring quaffing ecstasy, I sadly bid farewell to Mr. Edmund Fitzgerald as we part ways with one last moment.


From the Dortmunder Gold to the Edmund Fitzgerald, Im not sure where I can go next, though I am sure it can only get better. Great Lakes, brew on for I shall continue to drink on and somewhere in-between, may we meet many more times.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

br />5/14/2009:  Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter has always come across as a very roasty and robust porter.  It drinks more like a full blown stout, but is quite good and very respectable nonetheless.  This beer is near black in color.  It has a medium-full body that provides some heft to support the roasty, bittersweet chocolate aroma and flavor.  There are even some notes of coffee and black barley.  Overall this is a well-crafted, robust porter that still stands up today with all of the the other new and extreme beers.

This is one damn fine beer, the first porter to compete with Anchor in my book. The beer pours with a tight small head and a hazy ruby color.

Rosy and dark brown pour with a small, fizzy, dark brown head that leaves quickly and remains slightly lacy. The aroma is heavily malt backed with some notes of roast, sweet and dark chocolate, and a bit of mocha. There is a presence of bittering hops too. Light bodied with a standard watery porter taste. Not complex at all. Roasty, chocolate, coffee...the usual. Slightly more bitter than most, leaving a nice and dry aftertaste that lingers for a decent amount of time.

It goes without saying that most of this seems like total bullshit.  Anyway, it had a near black pour with a minimal khaki brown head.  Aroma was all coffee and roasted malt.  The flavor was good but not too complex, mostly just coffee, burn malt, and smoke.  It was pretty drinkable, but not nearly as smooth as other porters I have had with higher abv.s.

162,"2008-06-17",4.0,"Poured from a 12 oz. bottle.  Greyish chocolate look.  Molasses, cola syrup, milk chocolate, vanilla aroma; all toasted malt and brown sugar and cookie dough, with a lick of basic sugary sweetness throughout.  Foundational, with no nuances, and firmly set.  Dry, full, polished porter flavors; crisp leafy bitterness and a firm bittersweet nuttiness that dries out the wet, molasses-soaked maltiness quite nicely.  Pear and apple skin mid palate offering the simplest of tart fruit flavor, wetting a bit with a juicy fig like sweetness in the mid palate; this in tandem with all that molasses and coke syrup sweetness tends to allow a cloying quality to peek through, but its tamed easily by meatiness, delicate brown spice, and calm bitterness.  Milky, medium body is very soft, with just the right feathery touch for a traditional porter; plenty of pale malt doughiness in a warm, generous finish.  Exemplary.

162,"2008-06-17",4.9,"Presentation: It was poured from a 12oz bottle into a pint glass. It appears dark and opaque. It has a dark black color with deep crimson highlights when held up to light. The head is tan, thick and foamy with good retention. Some light tan lace slowly sides down the glass, chasing the head, as I drink. The aroma is full and rich. It has notes of caramel with a strong dark roasted malt presence that has a deep roasted espresso character. Its flavor has deep chocolate roasted malts with flavor notes of coffee and cream with bittersweet chocolate. The hops play well off the malt and further develop the bittersweet chocolaty flavors before slowly fading out into the finish. The palate is smooth, creamy and slightly slick with mild carbonation and a medium to full body. Outstanding.

Deep chestnut brown with a small, creamy beige head, and smelling of sweet chocolate, roasted malt, and oreos, this could easily be confused with a stout.  The taste leans back toward a porter, though, with more sweetness and less roast than you find in most stouts.  The body is medium to full, and the carbonation is about where it should be.

162,"2008-04-26",4.0,"Poured into my awesome new Kuhnhenn pint glass, thanks adam!

A- Pours a deep mahogany color letting almost no light pass through. A small one finger head tops the beer however it stays there for quite a while.

S- Smell is predominately roasted malts, a bit of sweetness. Not the most aromatic brew but decent none the less.

T- This is what I think a porter should taste like. Roasted malt flavor which leads into slight hints of coffee with an underlying sweetness the fades to a touch of hop bitterness in the end. Not an extreme brew by any means just well balanced and easy drinking.

M- Medium viscosity with quite a bit of carbonation, makes for easy drinking.

D- Its great to see a top 100 beer that is not so extreme. Ive gotten tired of giant bash your face in stouts and imperial porters where I feel like ive been hit by a freight train after each sip. This is a welcome break from that complexity and just brings to the table a simple, good porter. Definitely an excellent session beer, I would not hesitate to seek this out again and again.","California, USA","Lothore"

Aromas of cocoa, freshly ground coffee, fruity and malty. Slightly reminiscent of graham crackers. 

Taste is exceptional, and definitely lives up to the reputation. Slightly sweet, with milk chocolate and cappucino dominating. Again, I am tasting some graham cracker maltiness and a slightly sour flavor as well, which balances the sweetness. And I almost forgot the hops hiding in the background which lend a fruity crispness to the beer. 

Mouthfeel is rich, creamy and has a nice, drying finish. Coffee flavors linger ever so slightly, encouraging you to have another sip. Flavors of dark chocolate remain in the mouth while you ponder how good this beer is. 

Highly drinkable. Goes down very easy, ABV is moderate, making this beer one that you could easily have several in a sitting.

I will definitely keep this around.","Huron, Tennessee, USA","Tilley4"

162,"2007-12-28",4.0,"UPDATED: JAN 23, 2008 12oz bottle shared with ealdent. Pours an opaque black with a medium-sized tan head. The aroma is roasty with lots of black patent malts - some chocolate mixed with some burnt toast. There are also hints of hops in the aroma. The flavor follows the nose: thick black malt character with lots of burnt and dark chocolate flavors. There is also a firm level of fruity, floral, bitter hops. The finish is full, roasty, and bittersweet. The mouthfeel is full in body and has just the right level of effervescence - not quite creamy, but suitably lightened. Overall, an extremely well-made robust porter.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Anymore, however, it seems to be lacking the fruit sweetness and complexity that I have grown so fond of.  It does have a nice medium mouthfeel and a refreshing amount of hops.  Certainly worth a try, especially with red meat.","Canton, Ohio, USA","TyRip"

The flavor isnt quite as impressive, but its appealing nonetheless.  I picked up burnt caramel and toasted grains in addition to the aforementioned mocha and piney hop elements.

Medium-heavy body, with medium carbonation. Starts with nice chocolate malted sweetness, bitter coffee and a hint of burnt grain. Good sweetness to it.

Nice tan-brown foamy head, that quickly receded into a foamy thin cap, left nice lacing.

Neither is overpowering, but pleasant and strong enough to make you want more.  A really nice balance.

162,"2007-07-23",3.4,"Mothers milk? No but close enough for a hot July day. 

Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald Porter is really much better chilled colder than the 55 degrees the brewer recommends. The aroma escapes and wreaks havoc the moment the bottle is opened. You either drink it or you know youll be sorry.

This is a full-bodied brew splashed upon the palate, smooth on the descent and it doesnt leave a lot of bad memories for your tongue to argue with afterwards. The bottle says bittersweet coffee-chocolate but theres no suspicion you are sipping a latte hybrid. Its beer, good and wholesome and far better than what we expected from this brewery.

Pillowy cookie dough head over a ruby tinged black beer.  At first sip, you know that this is a porter closer to the Baltic side of the spectrum than the English.  Feels like a cold slab of fizzy chocolatey flavor that saves most of its punch for the finish, which is very dry chocolate, wet coffee bitter that is crisp (not a warm immersive bitterness, but rather an aloof standoffish bitter).  The finish eventually fades into lactic sweetness.  Roasty aromas with some toasted malts.  Very well defined, a pleasure to drink.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

The aroma is filled with dark malts and just a touch of floral hops, it is rather mild especially compared to the flavor. Once you dig into this robust porter the flavor immediately grabs you. Malts o plenty round out the dominant flavor consisting of coffee, chocolate, and plenty of roasted malts. The floral hops become slightly more hidden beneath the intense flavor.

Edmund Fitzgerald poured black. When held to the light there was dark mahogany highlights around the glass and where the light was coming through. Very nice light brown microbubble 1+ finger head with some medium bubbles throughout. Big chunky lacing as I drink.

This beer smells amazing. A lot of toffee and freshly ground coffee beans. Absolutely delicious smelling!

The taste is very good as well. Tastes like it smells with toffee up front. A little coffee coming through and some roasted/burnt malt. It seems Im tasting a little nuttiness at the end.

The mouthfeel is perfect for this beer. Its medium-heavy bodied. A little chewy and coats the mouth nicely.

162,"2006-12-31",2.0,"Ive been looking forward to tasting this again because I think the last time I tasted it I was influenced by the ambient surroundings.  You know how that is, a beer can taste good just because you are enjoying yourself. I remember the last time I drank this, we successfully started a sportster that had sat in the garage for a decade and a half, it only took three kicks! This is a 12 oz brown bottle.  Upon opening, cannot detect much aroma.  Pours pretty dark in my poor steeler stein, but still not much aroma.  Wait, I think I detect a roasty aroma hint with yeast.  Has an alabaster head that rapidly goes away to leave a ring of small bubbles around the top of the liquid.  During the commencement of taste I sense roasty bitter malt.  The bitterness does not hang on like many stouts, but you can definitely tell its there.  GL is one of the few companies that state the perfect temperature for serving right on the label.  Yes, this is a porter but I think I have tasted better.  This is better than SA holiday, yards gen washington and JW dundees porter but it is not within the reach of yuenglings black and tan or michs new porter.

Medium bodied, lightly carbonated mouthfeel.  The flavors are much drier than the aroma suggests, and the body may be a touch thinned by age.

It has a rich roasty and sweet malt flavor. Slightly tart burnt malt hits almost midway and stays to the finish. I get some chocolate here too.

Pour creates a faily tight, 1/2"" tan head which disappointingly fades quickly to a thin web-like wisp. Pleasant, but quite restrained aromas of bakers chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, dried dark fruit and coffee beans. Found the palate to be leaning toward the thin side; just a tad watery. Flavor shows off a bit more intensity than the aroma did with semi-sweet rich notes of dark chocolate, French roast coffee, roasted malts and burnt caramel candy. Some faint hop flavors sneak in to invoke some slight bitterness to tame the sweetness. Overall a bit tame but very well balanced.

This is an outstanding beer, not because it has assembled within it amazing flavors, although it does, but because it is done so well. This exemplifies what a porter should taste ice, with the light coffee, dust, straw, and roast coming together perfectly, not flavor over compensating for the other.

Very roasty, but smooth, in the mouth.  Somewhat unique in that respect.  Roasted malts and hops play very well with a slight grassy hops.

These two forces roll over my tongue like the waves that sunk its namesake.  Cocoa, coffee, vanilla, and deep roasted malts are the most prevalent flavors.

162,"2006-06-08",4.3,"Thanks to doulos for this one. Enjoyable, but not all that memorable. A nice porter, greatest quality was its drinkability.... the smooth and relatively light mouthfeel (vs. many a stout or thick porter). Poured a mahoganey brown with a respectable initial head that sustained itself well and laced decently. The aroma was of coffee and some chocolate. The flavor was a nice balance of coffee, chocolate, light smokey-roastedness, some hops, and a somewhat overall sweetness. Nice job by GL, but if you cant get it in your area, no biggee. Re-rate on a fresher bottle: Mouthfeel was dead on, not as acidic and thin as my first tasting (nice and creamy, but not motor oil). Flavor was much richer in the coffee category and very nicely balanced with hops in the finish. Contrary to my first experience, Id recommend getting if you can, more memorable on second tasting (fresher bottle).","","User37895"

The finsh is mildly bitter and the roasty flavor lingers. The mouthfeel is full, but average for a porter.

Overall a good, good beer. The bottle said to drink it at 45* mine got better and better as the temperature crept up at about 55+ I thought it was at its best.

162,"2006-01-24",5.0,"One of my very favorite brewpubs is the Great Lakes Brewing Company, of Cleveland, OH. This is one brewpub I have made return trips to ever since that first trip back in 1994. At that time, Great Lakes didnt have a brewery, all their beers were brewed at the brewpub, and they were a very local beer. GLBC has enjoyed some growth, and their market has grown from its small Northern Ohio roots to a few Midwestern states. I love all of Great Lakes products, but one beer has a special place in my beer loving heart, and that is Edmund Fitzgerald Porter. This is a delicious, rich, robust porter just packed with flavors. Some robust porters border on being stouts, they are very roasty, coffeeish, and the flavors quite intense. Edmund Fitzgerald is an outstanding example of robust porter.

This beer pours to a deep brown/black, opaque color with a big, tan, creamy head, and a soft carbonation. The nose on this beer is fantastic. Very malty aromas of dark chocolate malts, roasted barley, and coffee marry with a back drop of citric, piney, hop aromatics. The palate is wonderful. More big chocolate malt flavors, coffee, a touch of vanilla, and more roast. Edmund Fitzgerald has a very muscular malt back bone, this beer isnt hefty, but has a big body for a porter. This beer finishes with more good dark malt up front, then finishes with a long, dry, citric hop bite that lingers. A robust, flavorful, and vibrant beer. Match this with a nice porterhouse steak and baked potato. This is a great desert beer as well, it would go well with a chocolate brownie sundae with vanilla ice cream.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"
162,"2006-01-23",4.3,"Obtained in a trade with beeryum. Dark ruby reddish brown with a medium tan head. Rich chocolate, mocha and hops in the nose. Wow, very bold and flavorful. Up front, the flavor has big notes of chocolate, coffee, ovaltine, roasted malt, a touch of charcoal, plenty of hops and rich caramel/toffee sweetness. Totally delicious. Perfect body for a porter; full, round and very creamy with lively carbonation (without being as thick as some stouts). Decent head retention, light lacing left on the glass.

Aroma is sweet malt, chocolate, mild coffee, cocoa, mocha latee and roasted components. It smells good but it seems held back. Just doesnt open up all the way. The body is dark brown to black with a slowly diminishing thumb thick tan head.
<P>
Fore is smooth and creamy with ample chocolate notes, but more coffee and roast than I recall from past samples. Gets slightly watery though the middle, but ends quite robust and roasty with coffee acidity and bitterness and a hint of Anchor Porter-like molasses and brown sugar. Definitely a better beer than I remember. Perhaps Id had old bottles before, but this beer is  better than my memories of it.

Original Rating 3.5:
<P>
Strong malty aroma with a touch of mocha. Deep black with a thin bubbly head. Sweet and approachable flavor palate, but I hate to say it I am not as impressed as I thought Id be. There is a wateryness to the flavor in the finish that is impossible not to notice. A very decent porter, but I think it is highly overrated. Just doesnt have enough ass to it. Needs a lot more roastiness and less chocolate creaminess.","New York, New York, USA","NYHarvey"
162,"2005-08-22",4.4,"Beautiful ... dark and deep with a towering tan top.  Nice big mocha aroma.  Well rounded chocolate flavors, lightly bittered, with a tinge of a nice coffee.  Damn, this is a great beer.","Yorktown, Virginia, USA","Braudog"
162,"2005-08-22",4.3,"Pours a nice deep black with just a glimmer of ruby when held up to the light. Nice layer of silky fine tan head that lasts and lasts, and adds a nice smoothness to your lips on each sip. Probably the most dense and pretty head Ive seen from a bottled beer. (Barring those gimmicky widget bottles.) Lovely dark set of smells--somewhere between flourless chocolate cake and a cup of fresh coffee. Nice full mouthfeel, much more substance than the ABV would lead you to expect. Soft coffee flavors, with just enough roast to balance the sweetness level. Nice hint of burnt toast in the finish to give each sip closure. The hops barely register in the taste. Kind of a surprise at 60 IBUs. Id be tempted to call this a stout rather than a porter--and an unusually well crafted stout at that. Stylistic vagaries aside, this is amazingly fine beer, beautiful to look at, and perfectly balanced. There are lots of much bigger beers with not nearly this much character. Bravo!","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"

162,"2005-08-05",3.8,"Pours black with a medium tan head. Aroma is a fresh roast, semisweet chocolate, and cinnamon (I always get cinnamon from hops trying to poke through a strong roast malt). Flavor is a bitter roast cut by a sweet chocolate, a slight ashy smokiness with a  hoppiness on finish that comes from no where.  Medium to full body. Very hardy porter very full and assertive flavor.","Silver Spring, Maryland, USA","jeffin7"
162,"2005-08-03",3.5,"Draft, at GLBC. Rats. I didnt take many notes on this because I thought Id already rated this. But anyway: A light hoppy smell, unusual to find in a dark beer. This was toward the end of my sampler tray, there was still a thin head that clung lacily to the glass. Roasts are just moderate, to keep this very smooth.

Alternately dry and sweet maltiness up front. Morphs into strong roasted coffee bean flavors. This is like porters greatest hits. Smoky, sweet, creamy and bitter. Coffee and chocolate and damn smooth. It has it all. Really like this creamy mouthfeel.

Next to the murphys that my friends had ordered this was a little darker, more transparent, it had a lighter, less gray head, with excellent retention.  Very roasty, I didnt get much chocolate, but a little bit of carmely sweetness.  Good body and depth, hop profile mixed in with the bitterness of the roasted malts to make it more balanced and seamless, rather than a roasty/nutty/hoppy contrasting flavour that the description would have me guess.  I would have preferred one more contrasting and progressive, but this smooth brew was very enjoyable anyway.","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","sandwichpants"

162,"2005-01-12",5.0,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2009 After drinking many more beers I have returned to change my rating to a 5.  This is simply my favorite beer and I cannot rate it any other way.  This beer is unlike any other.  Aroma is very strong, and complex: initially a dark bitter vanilla, then a rich roasted malt.  Extremely bitter.  Very hoppy, very roasted.  It has been one of my favourite beers since I first tried it, definitely my favourite porter, and has my favourite aroma of any beer.  But its not for everyone: this is an extreme beer; it packs a punch and can come across as a bit coarse, unrefined, or too powerful.  However, I want to emphasize that it is precisely this coarse and unrefined quality that I love about this beer.  It tastes raw, uncontrollable, bizarre, overpowering...and yet somehow oddly comforting, wholesome, and heartwarming all at the same time.  This is one beer that tastes twice as good on tap.  In the bottle, the roasted quality overpowers the rest of the beer; on tap, much more complex and balanced,  I would recommend for everyone to try this beer...it certainly is not going to be liked by everyone, but those who like it really seem to love it.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","cazort"

On to the specifics of my 2004 Edmund.  Pours a lovely dark brown to mahogany with some yellow hints (almost headed to amber but more yellow) at the fringe.  Slightly sweet aroma that reminds me of molasses, roasted malt and perhaps some piney hops deep down.  The flavor was roasted malt, slightly sweet and piney right off the bat.

162,"2004-12-30",4.1,"Color is very dark brown with deep dark ruby highlights, dark as the waves that split the Fitz. Pencil width high head of tannish tight creamy foam, steady and calm, leaving port steady as she goes, no ship sinks in this stuff. Spotty stringy lace sticking some and some losing hold and sinking into the darkness from which it came. 
Aroma is crispy, roasty, slightly sweet and dark burntness of malts and a faint noteable hop. 
Taste sails along in roastyness, smooth at first, then the waves begin to pick up with sweet tinglyness, darkening up, a surge of bitterness through hops and ends into a light lingering smokey feel, woody, coffeeish finish. Moderately dry port to starboard, through and through. Feel is full and heavy, proudly bittering dry right on into the depths of finishing. Much like the ship, this beer sets sail but sadly never ports again. A bit disappointed in this porter being a fan of the great lake and the story of the Fitz.

Sweet mocha roast in the aroma (8+) and again in the flavour  where is is moderately bitter. Coffee bean notes are cumulative, increasing as the glass goes on. Pleasant mild mocha roast lingers long into the finish and aftertaste. Creamy smooth average palate is undercarbonated, and might be more full bodied otherwise. (3 to 3+)

<P>December 2004. Bottle. Brown/ruby tinged black body with a moderate beige head. Very nice aroma of dark chocolate and a touch of roast.

162,"2004-10-12",4.3,"Appearance: solid brown body, with a lush, flowing head of tannish foam atop, though in a hurry to settle down.
Aroma: mild at first, creamy, with hints of nuts, vanilla, caramel, with slowly the better earmarks of a good porter emerging, and were getting the roasted coffee, getting roastier and bitterer as we go, and as it unfurls we can detect things weightier, headier, more thick and viscous: molasses, syrup, motor oil.
On first sip and gulp, I was magically lifted up and removed from the mundane and the everyday. Mouth-filling, rich, powerful, flavorful, and just plain FULL!
Nothing loose or limpid here! Bitterness is just so, and soon turns to the sweet. I dont know what exactly to liken it to, but it seems to tread a middle ground: no too bitter, not to smooth, juuust right!
One caveat: the carbonation feels a bit too cola-like, and that aint good, in my book.
Finish is fine and long-lasting, settles in to occupy the mouth and endear itself to all the senses. 
However, a certain heft is lacking in overall body and character, that I would expect, nay demand, out of any true Baltic porter. Needs more Oooom-pa-pa-mow,mow!, if you follow.
Still an excellent porter, and one which Id greatly appreciate more, if it were available in my environs.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

The nose and initial sip make you think this will be a very mild porter, but that moderately strong dark roasted flavor up front picks up steam in the rather bitter and dark roasted finish; Light, but noticeable sweetness, but somewhat dry on the palate; The beer becomes more coffee-like in both the flavor and nose as it warms to room temperature; Medium to full bodied, about average for the style, and definitely lighter on the palate than the thick, chewy porters; Moderately dark roasted nose; Deep brown color has a ruddy hue when held to the light; Tan head has solid retention and leaves a fairly dense blanket of lacing on the glass at first, but most of that lacing vanishes within a minute or two; Maybe not in the upper echelon of porters, but it's not too far behind","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

The aroma was lightly fruity and hoppy with a hint of chocolate. The texture was thin and a bit watery. The flavor was strong with hops and really lacking in malt. I think if I was trying this blindfolded I would have pegged it as an IPA given how much the hops dominate and the malt disappears.

Aroma dominated by a coffee-ish roasted malt character layered with dark chocolate, hint of vanilla, and a spicy hop nose.  Moderately sweet start-to-finish.  Some esteriness emerged mid-palate along with roasted malt and hop characters, both of which became more distinct towards the finish and nicely balanced the sweetness.  Moderately sharp astringency from the roasted malt was quite evident in the aftertaste along with a hop flavor that lingered.  Palate was medium bodied with a somewhat lively carbonation.

Aroma is of roast coffee, and lightly sweet, with a strong chocolate malt presence and a bit of astringent roast character, though this is fairly muted.  The light sweetness is here in the taste as well, though the dark malt character tends to mute it out.  Roast malt notes with hints of coffee and a good chocolate presence round out the middle of this beer.  Definitely a great example of a porter, the burnt malt character is fairly muted.  Does not have as much of an acrid burnt malt finish as some, it is fairly smooth and drinkable like a good porter should be.  The medium body helps the drinkability, though it has so much flavor packed in it I would not recommend pounding this one, nor would I want too as this beer is just too enjoyable.  This one is nice and creamy.  It has a bit too much burnt malt flavor, if the burnt character was balanced more towards the chocolate side of the spectrum this porter would be perfect.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

162,"2004-03-13",3.6,"Immediate sharp roasted flavor in the nose along with some caramel alchohol. A touch vinous and a tad thin. The flavor is true to the aroma with an even more powerful roasted character, although I still find it to be a bit thin for the ingredients seemingly present. Sour grains cut through the roastiness for a flavor that is rather appealing actually. Not a bad porter.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"

Big black malt flavors lending a fair amount of phenols, balanced with a dose of prunes, dry chocolate, and earthy English hops.  Finishes semi-dry with a continuous burnt malt, caramel, and dark fruit concotion.  The carbonation was overly prickly, making it more airy than fluffy.

Not enough of it there I guess. Has a smooth mouthfeel is pretty well balanced, having a nice bitter hops finish. Good blackberry notes throughout and a medium to light body.  I have heard that this beer was made with better quality in days gone by and it shows.  Just needs more of everything, the potential is there, a wonderful balance and good complex chocolate, dark fruit, and coffee aroma rounded out with hops.  The argument that porters should not be and were not stouts does not really hold in my mind here.  This beer just dosent have enough flavor even for a porter, to put it in the very top tier.  Great balance though I will reiterate. Nice dark complexion, with a bit of brownish beige head.  Good berry smell. Alcohol not detectable.

Real good hop bite in the flavor helps straighten you out. Everyday beer, challanging as hell, winter or summer.

The taste starts off rich, with a coffee-like (not as much as some others, but still there) and caramel/toffee mix of the malts. This is lightened up a bit by the ample hops.

162,"2002-05-16",3.5,"Glad I still had some of this still sitting around in the fridge to put to formal testing procedures someday.  Im having this right after I had a Smith oatmeal stout, and they pour and look exactly the same, whoda thunk it.  That meaning, black, with a tan head that recedes to near-nothingness pretty quickly.  Got a musty aroma in the bottle (sorry, my sense of smell seems to be limited enough that my best whiffs come from when the nectar is nestled in its glass cage), and little aroma detected after that.  Upon getting it into my mouth, I found it surprisingly bland and stale.  I remember this from previous tastings, so its not an abberation with this bottle, Im afraid.  That makes downing one of these especially hard, considering were already dealing with a Porter here.  I mean, I dont even know if I detect any of the stuff that other drinkers claim to get that is supposed to give it complexity.  Just a predominantly woody flavor and woody feeling sitting in the gut.  Not the only Porter thats done this to me, BTW.  I just remember the woodiness, primarly.  You definitely get a chocolatey bite in Anchor that you dont get in this.  Okay, Ive gone on long enough, the rest isnt notable enough to comment on so Ill leave it there.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"
