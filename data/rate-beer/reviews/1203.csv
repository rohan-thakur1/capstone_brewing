Appearance - the body is a hazy light sunglow. The head is white and around 1"", and fades into a ringed layer of filmy suds.
Taste - has a really citrus juiced hop presence, with a little spliced in pungent and floral hops. The citrus hops have notes of peach, mango, pineapple close to the rind, starfruit, and some light lemon. There is a slight caramel malt underneath, some flaked oat, and a little vanilla.

1203,"2016-10-19",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed this as part of the long-anticipated Toppling Goliath Brouhaha with Travis, Chris, Doug, and Ryan at Traviss house on September 24. 16 oz can I brought. The pour is a thick and chunky golden yellow with a thick white head. The aroma is juicy, full of tropical fruit and pine resin. There is a bit of a floral hop here that Im not too crazy about. The flavor is much of the same. An overload of juicy tropical fruits up front, a nice bitter pine resin, and a hint of floral hops on the finish. There is almost a hint of spicy grain to this one as well. The mouth feel is a little thicker than Id like to see with a nice carbonation and a lot of fruitiness on the back end. This is pretty good, though its not my favorite from Trillium.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
1203,"2016-10-13",4.5,"I have been waiting to try this one. Can poured into a snifter. Comes out a very hazy orange color with a thin layer of head that disappears quickly to the edge of the glass. The smell hits you quickly after opening the can, dank hops, ripe fruit, and spice. The flavor allows you to narrow down what you were smelling, some citrus fruit, melon, and peach jump out followed by some spicy floral bitterness. The feel is medium and crisp, not at all what the appearance makes you think but goes well with the flavor. This has a lot going on, all the hops add great characteristics and Im always a fan of the Nelson Sauvin. Seek this one out!","Brooklyn, New York, USA","meyers1023"

1203,"2016-01-08",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2017 Batch #1 bottled 12/17/15, drunk 1/3/15.Not completely clear, though a far, far cry from the normal Trillium soup appearance. The bottom of the bottle has zero sediment left behind despite a careful pour. Head is large, white and still shows strong retention, though maybe not quite the degree of the soupier versions.Nose shows bright citrus: tangerine, lemon, light ruby red grapefruit and definite hints of caramel malt and pine on the end. Some mosaic-like leafy/earthy qualities with nectarine and even a touch of light banana. Dont get much nelson sauvin, maybe a touch of grassiness and pear. Pleasant enough, though a bit unfocused and given over to the malt a bit much, like Scaled. Otherwise, clean, without any alcohol noted.Flavor is fairly bittersweet, with marmalade, orange rind, nectarine and plenty of earthiness. Light pine, nearly cakey sugars and moderate tropical fruits on the finish. Pretty strong on the mosaic, which is fine with me, though theres a lot of the mushy apricot quality that I dont love from that hop. Moderate bitterness, no real resin and pretty drinkable, with a soft, sweet, malty mouthfeel.Eh, its better than Scaled, but still leaves a lot to be desired on brightness and balance. Batch #2 is reported to be back on track with the soupiness, so as predicted, this high clarity phase was just working out the kinks. Will try to pick up and rate a batch 2 bottle.  7/4/7/3/14Canned 8/10/16, drunk 9/8/16.Well I didnt pick up batch 2 and Ive lost count of what this is (4 or 5 I believe), but Im glad I re-tried because it is just chalk full of Nelson goodness.  Love the galaxy and mosaic but I think Nelson is quickly becoming my favorite.  Big juice aromas and a dry, mineral-laden, gruner-like nelson character.  Awesome texture as usual, with great attenuation.  Another knockout and one Id be happy to drink any time.  8/5/8/4/16

Canned 3/29, drunk 4/1/17.Not quite as exciting and juicy as I recall and nowhere near the batch of DDH Scaled a month earlier.  Kind of Vicinity-like, which is to say quite good, but a little lacking in personality.  Lots of citrus, light juicy tangerine and dry pineapple.  Bigger than it needs to be and more bitter and grapecruit-laden as well.  Score is for this sample.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
1203,"2016-01-07",4.1,"Bottle. Pours very hazy orange, medium off white head, good lacing. Aroma is super piney, pot, stonefruit. Flavor is light sweet, light bitter, juicy and dank. Medium body. Tasty.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
1203,"2016-01-02",3.7,"Bottle - Galaxy, Mosaic, and Nelson Sauvin hops? Um, yes please! Pours hazy amber with a filmy off-white head. Nose is Juicy Fruit, dry white grape, dank green onion, and oodles of citrus. Next to no malt--just real light, crackery pale malt. Taste is a little sharper, with some booziness coming through the same hop profile thats on the taste. That takes away from it a bit--at 8% I didnt really expect that. Its medium-bodied, oily, with medium carbonation. Another really solid beer from Trillium.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
1203,"2015-12-28",4.2,"Bottle at home. As soon as I popped the cap it filled the room with a huge aroma of tropical hops -- this one is waves of orange and grapefruit. Surprisingly smooth and dry, but with a full-ish mouthfeel and that distinctive malt profile and hop character of Trillium beer. Excellent.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
1203,"2015-12-27",3.8,"Growler from Canton. Pours a super clear golden orange, thin white head. Aroma is grapefruit pith, pine, citrus, mango and star fruit. Flavor is gooey grapefruit and citrus, sweet malt, faint booze, pine. Full bodied, med sweet and fruity, light carb. More of a balanced clean and classic DIPA, no overwhelming elements.","New York, USA","drsandman"
