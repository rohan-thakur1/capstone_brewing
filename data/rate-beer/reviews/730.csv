730,"2016-05-12",3.7,"Draft at Zenos. Poured a dark ruby brown color with a small white head. Aroma was tasty rye spice, lots of citrus. Flavor was nice rye, citrus notes. Delicious!","Alexandria, Virginia, USA","radagast83"
730,"2014-05-17",4.1,"Transfer from BA - 

Poured from bottle into pint glass

Appearance - A very dark red color,almost brown. A off white head formed in pouring and faded fast giving way to some nice lacing.

Smell - Hops hit you up front. Citrus and pine really take hold. Can pick up a faint hint of caramel, but the hops really dominate.

Taste - Sweetness of caramel and malty bread like flavor hit the mouth right when the beer meets the tongue. This is quickly overshadowed (but in a pleasant way) by the hoppiness of the beer. The citrus hop flavor stands out, but a bit of the pine works in with the citrus. Very tasty.

Mouthfeel - I would say just about a perfect level of carbonation and a nice smooth body. This is one beer that is both easy and enjoyable to drink.

Overall - One of the best ryes I have ever had, and high on my overall list.","","Darkmagus82"

730,"2014-04-25",3.5,"Pours brown red with white head out of bottle from brewpub. Butterscotch and grainy nose with some fruity hops. A bit sweeter than expected for a rye, but the rye bread presence is there, along with some brown sugar and mild hop flavor, mild bitter.

730,"2013-12-03",4.1,"Bottle from Ottos. Pours chill hazy dark straw, looking ruddy medium brown through direct light, and a finger of uniform, creamy off-white head. Nose is heavy rye malt, caraway seed, brown sugar. The flavor is assertively, awesomely, and singularly rye, a lovely rye that permeates the palate and the senses. Some earthy and caraway seeds creep in at mid-palate, and late hops, but the rye rules here, and the rye rewards are ruthlessly refreshing, Ralphie.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"

730,"2013-10-25",4.0,"DATE TASTED: October 18, 2013 ... GLASSWARE: Howards Pub pint... OCCASION: another booty of beer for beating Ryan in fantasy baseball--prosit, friend!...

AROMA: bright rye scent reminiscent of vanilla and clove; some cinnamon and cookie dough as well; nicely complex..PALATE: full-bodied, big in the mouth and substantial in its aftertaste; nicely balanced...TASTE: an ale that retreats at its impact; actively citric at the throat but easy-drinking with a doughy exhale...OVERALL: a slap of something heavier hits at the glasss bottom; a winner in the sense that most pales occupy the same space on the tongue, while this beer--and Ottos is a great place to enjoy beer, BTW--engages in a slightly nuanced way with some extra ABV to boot...","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"
730,"2013-07-18",3.7,"Bottle during a Jackie Os bottle share (notes). Pours a clear amber color with a medium sized off white head. The aroma is spicy rye malts, crisp citrus with a hint of tropical fruit and some sweet notes. The flavor definitely favor the spicy rye, some sweetness early with more bitterness setting in late. Lightly toasted, caramel and some citrus hops.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"

730,"2013-05-26",3.7,"UPDATED: MAY 27, 2013 Poured a clear dark amber with a two finger white head.Smells like citrus and aromatic hops. A little caramel malt comes throughCitrus and a little earthy pine in the taste. Perfectly balanced.

730,"2013-05-01",3.8,"22 oz bottle.  Pours a clear bright copper body with a small fizzy white head that faded to a thin film.  Light visible carbonation.  The nose is very spicy with tons of rye malt and and a bright tropical fruit quality from the fairly heavy handed hoppiness.  Smells a lot like Nelson hops, but the label doesnt state what was used.  The flavor is an interesting mix of the rye and the fruity hops, the combo yields an almost papaya like flavor that is pretty interesting.  Theres very minimal bitterness to the hops, its all flavor.  A little bit of caramel sweetness makes it past the rye, but its not overly sweet.  Medium bodied with fizzy prickly carbonation.  Lingering tropical fruit notes that last forever.  Quite an interesting beer, I was not expecting the hop profile that I got with this beer.  I was expecting something very citrusy and resiny with lots of bitterness to enhance the rye, but its 180 from that.  Certainly a beer to seek out and give a try if you have the chance.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

If I had to sum this beer up I would call it a reuben in a glass. With the mixture of rye and other flavors playing against each other well I thought about trying to get myself a bomber to take home and share. If you are in State College be sure to not miss this gem.

Aroma / Appearance - The opaque body masks about a third of the light of the dark basement. Coppery bronze with a yellowed eggshell head it looks like brittle paper. Rye bread wrapped around a warm reuben sandwich makes the mouth water. The vague sweetness adds even more depth.

Flavor / Palate - A chewy pairing of rye and licorice tickle the palate. Black anise lingers in the back of the throat. Filling and robust it is a great local release. If I could have tried more beers in this vein over the few days in town it would not have been a waste.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

730,"2012-06-24",4.1,"Draft at Zenos. Pours dark brown with an inch of white foam that leaves some lacing in the glass. Big rye on the nose. I could smell this beer all day. Nice rye notes on the tongue as well but theres balance. Its not overpowering. Finishes clean. This beer is worth the trip alone.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
730,"2012-02-10",4.2,"Old Review from back in 2010 - Zenos Rye Ale pours a hazy dark amber color.  A huge fluffy head is poured initially but quickly calms down to the picture up above.  Spotty lacing throughout the glass.  The smell is definitely the smell of a fantastic IPA.  Nice caramel malt background, citrus with a slightly piney aroma.  Mixed in there is the spicy rye.  Its not huge at all.  Not like the latest rye beer I had, Founders Reds Rye PA.  This one just mixed in perfectly.  Lovely smell.  I couldnt take my nose away.

Taste is just fantastic.  I really hope Ottos eventually puts this out full time because as soon as I finished my glass I had thoughts of calling Jeff and asking him to get more.  Once again the rye is there but it just sits perfectly with every other ingredient.  Nothing really stands out.  Everything meshes together into an almost perfect taste.  Citrus, bready, caramel malt, and the spicy rye.  Fantastic IPA with a slight amount of rye and bitterness.   What makes it even better is the mouthfeel.  Its full, smooth, and really creamy.  Coats your mouth.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","drunkenpolack"

730,"2010-05-11",4.4,"On-tap at Zenos earlier this afternoon.

A- Body is a nearly transparent red/amber hue. Served with a 1/2 finger or so slightly rusty foamy head. Head fades to a thick collar but has great retention from there. Some lacing left behind in the glass.

S-Nice hoppy smell, lots of grapefruit and other citrus (lemon, orange) upfront but a good bready backbone with a hint of caramel.

T- Taste is similar to the smell. Nice hoppy flavor with a good dose of citrus hops upfront and a substantial bready rye and caramel malt backbone. Finish is more hoppy as the bitterness begins to kick in but a sweet breadiness lingers to balance out the bitterness.

P- Medium tingly carbonation and medium weight body that is full,smooth, and somewhat oily.

O- This is awesome and one of my favorite rye beers-2nd only to Cane & Ebel. Well put together and very drinkable-Id like to try other offerings from Ottos pub.

Serving type: on-tap

730,"2010-03-23",3.8,"On tap at Zenos. Pours a clear, red-orange colored body with a finger-width, frothy, white head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is solid. Citrusy florals and grass with a light rye, peppery spice. A bit oily and resiny with a light bready caramel. Flavor is nice. Lots of citrus grass with some resin and peppery rye. Plenty of fruity florals with a light, balancing malt. Finishes a bit resiny and oily with a good amount of bitterness and very crisp.

730,"2009-05-10",3.9,"On tap at Zenos. Nice hoppy aroma with some noble hops perhaps, musky rye grain. Fresh and grassy. Drak brown clear with mild haze and creamy light tan lacing head. Medium watery body with medium-high carbonation. Starts fairly dry and hoppy with light rye-wheat sweetness. Nutty hoppy finish with light bitter grassy after. Good rye flavor but not overly astringent. Good stuff.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Nate"

730,"2008-10-24",3.4,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2009 Draft at Zenos.  Mostly clear dark rusty copper.   Wet, sticky nose of oily old oranges and honey and with a small note of fresh, wet c-note hops.  Wet, oily texture, nice and calm and smooth. Rye character is moderate, some caramel and toffee, heavy toffee in fact. Mildly astringent and rough, but overall a nice beer.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
730,"2008-09-11",3.6,"On tap at Zeno’s Pub. Aroma is a rather juicy Cascade-like hop punch. Pours a darker copper-sienna, clear, with a rocky head in off-white. Flavor is crips. It’s almost like a hoppy Rye Octoberfest. The flavors are restricted to an American ale yeast profile, calm alcohols, and some faint rye bread. I never really get rye beers. They’re never that complex or different, just a bit spicy. A fair hand of hops here. Crisp. Balanced, with decent alcohols, sugar, yeast, hops and rye spice all combining nicely. What remains is a solid, sessionable ale.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
