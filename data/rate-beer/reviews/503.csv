503,"2016-12-31",4.1,"750 ml bottle, I think from Badger Spirits in Beloit, WI, about 3-4 months old, served a little below cellar temp in a New Glarus flute. Pours a cloudy rust-copper with a medium fizzy off-white head that dies away quickly, leaving thick crystalline lacing and a thin lasting ring...fruity, lightly honey-sweet aroma at first seems to be all cranberry, but the apple shows through with some time and perhaps the cherry as well, eventually; also a touch of flowers (lilac) and a bit of perfume - not quite as entrancing as some of this breweries other fruit beers and not, at least in this bottles case, quite as potent...but on the tongue it has the usual wonderful sweet-tart-acidic-fruity character as the Belgian Red and other masterpieces; this one is a little softer I think and less acidic, although the finish is fairly strong and theres a lasting cran-apple note that continues on for minutes after the last sip...strong effervescence, juicy texture that nonetheless offers plenty of pale malt - these things always do in the last judgment taste and feel like beer, and thats the great tribute to this brewery. Ive had this probably 6 or 8 times including a couple of times on tap, and this is probably the least impressive sample thus far, though still excellent. Draught renditions had a bit more carbonation and a bit more tartness and some lactic qualities which I like.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

503,"2016-07-24",4.2,"Bottle. Reddish copper color. Off white head. Aroma of advertised fruit - apple, cranberry, and cherry. Flavor more of the same, but beautifully balanced. No one flavor dominated. Pretty sweet but with a nice mellow tartness to balance it out. Medium to light body with medium carbonation. Has a sparkling wine quality. Super drinkable, but take your time and appreciate the complexity and craftsmanship. Nice beer for the style.

503,"2016-06-10",4.8,"Its pretty damn cool when some new friends surprise you with a bottle of New Glarus as you come through the door. Serendipity pours like the Ocean Spray grape/cranberry blend I like drinking for breakfast. Reddish-purple pour with a pinkish fizzy head. Hell, it even kind of smells like the Ocean Spray - both fruity sweet and tart aromatics. Flavor is a perfect blend of light sourness - not just from the cranberries but also from the apples and cherries. Just as the tartest aspects of each fruit have been captured, theres also the sweetest, starchiest characteristics. Refreshingly vinous and juicy. Phenomenal dessert in a glass. This left me in a happy stupor.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"
503,"2016-06-06",3.8,"Bottle drunk 5/30/16.Beautiful crimson-violet body is topped by a beige head that shows moderately-strong retention. Good clarity.Cherry-cranberry acidity in the nose smells quite authentic and is trailed by an almost granny smith-like appleskin note as well. A touch of medicinal character to the fruit but its not off-putting. Light wheat and biscuit behind it. Fruit really deepens in complexity as it warms and breathes with blueberry and grape-like notes emerging (despite none being used), as well as light vanilla and rich buttercream. No alcohol or flaws.Sweet and tart it has a nearly syrupy fructose character up front, with light cider qualities. Cherries come through the middle with strong cranberry tartness on the finish. Low but tight carbonation and just a touch of medicinal character with wheat, vanilla and honey notes adding a solid beer element and helping balance the sugar somewhat. After finding Red and Tart both just too sweet, I can finally say I enjoy this offering. Sure, Id still like a good deal less sweetness, but the strong tartness nearly balances here and the fruit flavors are quite enjoyable.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
503,"2016-05-29",4.1,"750 ml bottle shared with the wife (had this many times but never rated). Pours a clear dark reddish amber color with a medium sized off white head that hangs around. The aroma has an abundance of sweet and lightly tart fruit, cherry, apples, berries and sweet malts. The flavor has more of the same, cherries, some apple, cranberries, some skins, actually very similar to Belgian Red with less sweetness and just a touch of bitterness and fruit skins, very solid.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
503,"2016-03-12",3.8,"Sampled at the SCCCT event at Friendship Brewery. It poured a copper / red color with an off-white head. The aroma was of cherries, apples and some nuttiness.

503,"2016-02-23",4.5,"Poured into a snifter.

3.25 A: Clear cherry plum color. One finger of beige fizzy head that falls pretty quickly and leaves no lacing.

5.0 S: My goodness. Actually, holy shit. The fruits in this are incredible. All of them come through supremely strong. I cant decide whether the apple, cranberry, or cherry is most potent. Its like a cider mixed with a cherry wine and cranberry sauce except that they dont suffer from dilution. This might even smell better than its big sisters.

4.75 T: Like the nose, the fruit trio is incredible in the taste. Equal strength among them all. Powerful and delicious. Any semblance of the base beer is covered by the fruits. Just so damn good.

4.5 M: Medium body. Good spritzy moderate carbonation. This doesnt have the dense syrupy mouthfeel that the fruit twins have. Rather, this is more crisp and refreshing. Still very good.

5.0 D: Love it. I could drink a bottle everyday for a good month if I had the money and the beer.

Appearance: Pours a deep, rich mahogany red-brown, and forms a dense, fluffy multi-finger head of off-white foam that lasts and lasts. Lacing is off the hook.

Smell: Fruit greets the nose cheerily, a burst of cranberries and cherries, all just slightly sour. Beneath, tones of sweet red apple and caramel malt buttress and support the sour fruits.

Taste: Just a sublime fruit beer. This opens much like an apple juice made with gala and honeycrisp, which has had a significant amount of cherry-cranberry preserves dissolved in it. There are faint hints of tart sour to the fruit, and the barest whiff of farmland funk along for the ride. All of that dances atop a solid platform of sweet caramel malt flavor. The finish and aftertaste are a mix of the fruit juice and malt aspects. Sublime.

Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy, smooth, clingy, sticky, and yes - that bit of word salad adequately sums up the feel.

The aroma is straight up apple juice. Thats all there is; apple skins and juice. The flavor mimics it to a tee. It almost tastes like an apple juice cocktail, because there are other light fruit juices in it. I pick up a little bit of cranberry and a light cherry tartness.

Aroma is full of cherries and cranberries, with some apple and perhaps a bit of wood. Taste is much sweeter than I feared it would be, since the brewery called this a sour ale. Its more like a cranberry/cherry cider: crisp and sweet. Body is light to medium and a little viscous, but with lively carbonation. This one did not disappoint at all.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ccex"

Aroma has berry juice, hay, some cranberries and mild tartness. Flavour has cranberries, tartness, sweet cherries, some acidic tones and sweet berry juice tones.

503,"2015-03-11",4.3,"Bottle: Clean, slick ruby-tinted mahogany pour with great clarity. Foamy beige cap settles in on top to a chunky collar tracing the edges. Smells like someone stepped on a proximity mine at your local fruit market. Goddamn, son. The apples, the cherries, the cranberries. Theyre all there. You can identify every single one of them. So raw, so juicy, so sweet, so tart, so pure, so fruity. Flavor is a perfect mix of sweetness & tartness, as to not allow a single one of them to fatigue your palate too quickly. Apples up front are quickly followed by black cherry; juicy like juice, sweet like pie filling, & tart like fresh harvest. The back-end shows the most of that slightly acidic & bitter cranberry note, still tame & tempered well by the sweetness of the other fruits. Finishes right on the cusp of that sour/sweet line & before you know it, the fucken bottle is gone. Serendipity is the truth. Possibly the best true ""fruit beer"" I have had.

Une touche de vanille et des biscuits qui ne sont pas trop sucrés. Les arômes sont délicieux et sans artifices. Je pourrais même dire que cette représentation me semble assez exceptionnelle. Au goût, le mélange fruité est riche et profond. Beaucoup de cerises, de petits fruits sauvages et de fruits du verger saniment sur mes papilles et les rendent bien heureuses. Le côté acidulé de cet amalgame vitaminé est tout en justesse. En bouche, le liquide a un corps juteux. Le pétillement est bien ajusté. La texture est douce.

503,"2014-08-08",3.3,"The aroma is predominantly cranberry with apple undertones. Pours a clear red with a full light pink head. The flavor is very sweet, especially if there was a wild fermentation. The flavor starts with tart cranberries, then changes to apple cider, and finishes slightly tart with a hint of cherries. Very light and easy drinking. I was not expecting this much apple flavor to come through in a beer. If you like sweet fruit beers, you will probably enjoy this more then me.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","Nephilium"

A bit on the sweet side though, needed a little more dryness or bitterness maybe.

503,"2014-06-26",5.0,"First off- thanks to my friend John, a Wisconsin native, for picking up a bottle of this at some random truck stop on his way back to Kentucky. He always makes a point to bring back some beer, even when I dont ask. Appropriate that this beer is a ""happy accident,"" since my friend picked it up without knowing anything outside of New Glarus being a brewery I request beer from often. A happy accident, indeed. Aroma: As if this review hasnt went on long enough already- the apples remind me of a childhood aroma- an apple tree near my home growing up, which had this tart, but earthy scent. Ive smelled nothing like it as an adult, until now. Theres also some cherry and just a hint of cranberry. Appearance: Murky apple butter coloured pour with a foamy bone head that settles into a pronounced tuft. Flavor: Mostly wild, lightly tart apple up front with the majority of the cherry coming in toward the finish; cranberry stays on the periphery, quietly complementing the apple and cherry. Palate: Light body, slick texture, flat carbonation, lingering finish. Overall: Theres nothing Id change about this beer, and every drink of it was a reminder of its excellence. A beer worth seeking out.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"

503,"2014-05-30",3.5,"This is a cool brew. Rather than faking the funk and getting cherries from wherever the hell, New Glarus went old school and just used what was cheap and available. I am into it. This one seems to have more beer character than the other New Glarus fruit beers too, which are delicious but taste more like fruit flavored sodas to me. This is cloudy purplish red and headless after a minute or so. It is sweet, fruity and tart as you would expect but there is also something of a caramelly malt character to it, which adds the impression of full body. The finish is pretty long and sweet but there is a bit of tannins and acidity to balance. I dont like this stuff quite as much as most people seem to but I still enjoy it quite a lot. It is delicious after a fashion but these days my ideal fruit beer is a lot less fruit and a lot more beer than this is.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

The flavors are pretty much as expected at first: cherries, apple, cranberry, maybe even raspberry; definitely consistent with the description. Lightly tart and prickly in the mouth with lots of slick malt complexity which I think really separates a New Glarus fruit beer from many others. Then theres somewhat of a twist with soft chocolate character, giving it a chocolate covered cranberry or cherry taste. Definitely sweet stuff, of course. Is it as good as Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart? I dont know, maybe not but its right in line with both of those and probably better than Cranbic and Apple Ale.

Taste is unparalleled in the style....even among the other New Glarus fruit beers. This one stands out. Offering waves of complexity. Loads of tart fruits explode across my palate. A slightly fizzy mouthfeel gives me these candy soda sensations. Almost tasting like chewy sweetarts! Apple juice, cranberries, smashed cherries. Wow. Everytime I drink this, I love it more! I could go on.... The balance of the malts/yeast is so harmonious, you take it for granted. The common thread among these New Glarus beers, the yeast character is so unique and signature. Bubblegum sweetness with a light cereal grain balance to the ever so slight oak and vanilla. I feel like my vocabulary is lacking the verb-age to give this beer justice.

Pours a fairly clear pinkish amber color with a with a huge bubbly pink tinged head that persists forever. The aroma is sweet tart and fruity. Tart and sweet cherries with bits of brown sugar and a touch of apple cider and tart berries with a hint of vanilla and oak. The flavor is quite sweet but the tart and fruitiness from the berries and apples counter that nicely. Very subtle woody vanilla flavors round this one out nicely.

503,"2013-12-01",3.8,"No bottling information.
Appearance: The body is mildly hazy with a pink tinted red hue, sort of violet hued as well. The head is short and dense, but quickly becomes a foamy light tan coating. Sort of dish soapy.
Aroma: The aroma is huge and fruity. Immediately cranberry juice comes to mind and instantly creates a huge thirst. Green apples appear on second smell, coming off tart. On a third go I get bright cherries. The fruit medley is sublime, leaning tart and bright. Well done.
Taste: Oh boy this is like a carbonated juice. The intro is strong of sweet cherry and it lays a bold foundation with apples taking the second platform in strength. The cranberries are really downplayed, acting mostly to dry up the beer a bit as its a bit sweet. The flavors are mildly tart and the base is like syrupy juice. The flavor throughout is incredibly bold and the finish has a mild vinegar to it. This is pretty nice, but a bit thick.
Palate: Full-bodied, bordering on syrupy, with mild carbonation.
Overall: This is a pretty great beer, its like a grown up fruit punch. I find that its a bit too bold and syrupy in the flavor though, perhaps some more carbonation would help lighten that up. The vinegar on the finish is a nice touch though and I would love to try this with some salads with vinegar based dressings or cheesecake.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

503,"2013-08-31",3.2,"A steady pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a three-finger thick, pink tinged, tan colored head. The beer is a dark, concentrated plum-amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, cranberry-juice red hue when held up to the light. The aroma is fruity and sweet; candied cranberries, fruity sweet cherries, and flora apple notes also have a touch of fruit tartness to it. The aroma reminds me quite a bit of a some sort of cough syrup, or perhaps of some sort of syrup I should be using in a desert. I cant even pretend to smell anything of the base beer here.

Sweet with lots of prickly carbonation and predominantly fruity. The finish tastes characteristically of apples, while up front the cherry notes intermingle with a light cranberry character; the cherries also linger into the finish with a cherry skin fruitiness that lingers a bit on the palate. There is a touch of tartness here that helps to slightly temper the sweetness. At times the mix of fruit reminds me of childrens aspirin in the finish. The body is certainly a bit thick, it has a fullness to it that lingers a bit on the palate; definitely something to be sipped slowly. Once again the base beer is pretty much non-existent, perhaps a hint of maltiness, but I could very well be imagining it.

Nice as a desert, and in fairly small quantities, or if you have a serious sweet tooth. I honestly dont understand why this is ranked so highly compared to the fake, sweet, fruit Lambics out there; clean, candy sweet, and fruity, they are quite similar and can work in certain situations, though for my particular palate I wouldnt choose to drink these very often.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The cranberry tartness complexed with the imparted yeast acidity and tartness makes this beer very good. The finish to the beer has a strong apple juice quality in both flavor and texture. Body is light with some stickiness too it. The carbonation is very fine and lends a slight sharpness too it. Overall a very good beer. The sweetness is a bit on the strong side for one person to consume and I could see this being a fantastic beer in smaller doses as a dessert. The apple juice quality at the end of the flavor would my only knock as it doesnt seem to be transformed in the brewing process. Still a great beer.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"

A - Pours a clear dark red body with a fingers worth of purple stained foam. Leaves behind a patchy cap and some solid lacing with a swirl. Looks very juice like but with an excellent head.

S - Tart cranberries, ripe apples, some cinnamon spice from the cherries, and thats it. Ripe, fresh, and juicy are all terms that come to mind. This might blur the line between beer and fruit juice, but who cares when it smells this great.

T - Pleasantly tart cranberries, ripe apples, and some cherries and spice on the finish. Just a touch of malts can be found here but otherwise this is like drinking a sparkling cran-apple juice. Mouth feel is medium bodies with low carbonation. Im not sure if its detrimental or not but it does feel somewhat syrupy. That does make it a bit of a chore to drink solo but the flavor is so amazing that slowly sipping on it is somewhat welcomed.

Has a very fruity aroma; tart. Appealing yet it didnt prepare me for the magnificent taste.  The flavor is loaded with mixed fruit, with both cranberries and cherries evident.  Perfect TART/sweet balance.

Aroma is loads of fresh fruits, cherry and apple, some pie crust and graham cracker. Medium to slightly thinner bodied with average carbonation. Flavor is the same as the aroma with a great apple and cherry combo along with pie crust and a slight touch of cranberry. When it comes to fruit beers no one is even close to New Glarus.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

Smelled of apples and cranberries, and had an excellent fruity taste! Honestly the best beer I've had from NG, and one of the best beers I've ever had! Can't wait to get it again next fall!

A- A dark red colour, big head of foam that shrinks down quickly but leaves some nice lacing behind.

S- As soon as I popped the cap, the aromas literally permeated the area around me. Big green apples and sweet cherries every darn where...ooh..I am SO digging it. I could almost hover my nose over the glass for hours but...its time to take a sip or 2, eh?

T- Oh my! The apples and cherries are there as expected but better executed than even I expected(not my first venture into NG Fruit/Vegetable beers) and then Im hit with a mild cranberry tartness. Whoah, Nellie, this brew kills it!

Vibrant, wine-dark reddish pour with the same tight carbonation from NGs other fruit beers. Immediate impression on the nose is a pleasant rush of memory when encountering that deliciously distinctive oak quality Dan Carey gets with his fruit beers. Glorious mix of sweetness and tartness in the nose, deep ripe cherry, tart apple, and dried cran (the latter more prominent the further you linger over this beer). Taste is slightly more tart than sweet, though still exquisitely balanced. Hints of malts and fruitbread peek through, but its mostly just content to linger at the oaky intersection of these three fruits. A triumph.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Behold, Serendipity! A sour fruit beer that shows the skill of the brewmaster and also makes the beer drinker yearn for more from this great brewery (www.newglarusbrewing.com). While Spotted Cow seems to be the most recognizable of the brews that New Glarus produces, and it definitely has its place, they push out much more great beer than that. If youve never had their Double IPA, Raspberry Tart, Belgian Red, Black Top, Moon Man, Enigma and many more, its time to run up to Platteville or even head to Madison or New Glarus itself to check out more of their products.

Explosive cherry aroma with some sharp tartness to it, immediately similar to Jolly Ranchers. Flavor is revelatory, as is the case with most NG fruit beers. An absolute barrage of concentrated fruit madness. Cherries make up the major flavor component, candy-sweet but natural-tasting, with a base of ice cider apple flesh and a perfect cranberry bite on the finish, rounding out the immense sweetness with a divine tartness.

A constant tug of war emerges between the sweetness from the cherry and the sour from the apple/cranberry. The cranberry is most apparent in the finish. Oak makes a late appearance. It's not super apparent but it adds a nice layer to the complexity. Mouthfeel is full and carb is lively. This is an incredible brew.

If this is a temporary replacement for Belgian Red I hope that it sticks around a bit longer. This is right up there with Raspberry Tart as a world class sour fruit beer. Before it disappears from the shelves I am going to pick up a few more for the cellar.

Aroma / Appearance - A purplish red body shimmers and glows. The red edges give the color of a setting sun. Dirty white flecks of head and soft legs give it just the right amount of depth. Cranberries, apples, and cherry fruit pie sweeten the air like the judging table at a county fair.This is a blend of a candy store and an orchard.

Flavor / Palate - Cranberries and apples are sweet on the tip of the tongue. The tang that hangs in the back of the throat is like a sharp lemonade. From start to finish this is a great balance between sweet and sour. Until Belgian Red comes back this is a fine substitute.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

503,"2013-02-06",4.0,"Pours a deep red with minimal head after pouring. Smells of tart cherry and apple. Tastes almost the same as it smells. Drinks very similar to theBelgian Red and the apple in it does nicely too even it out.","Illinois, USA","Imperial_Scout"
503,"2013-02-05",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Portentous cranberries and Montmorency cherries leap from the glass, sticking to the palate even after just one sip.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A crown of foam circles the clear garnet.
-The flavor profile is in line with the powerful aroma.
-This tastes like a super fruity soda of the best kind. But it doesnt have the drinkability. 
-Cranberries dont have the appeal of raspberries or cherries in beer, imho. But this will definitely please all those looking for an intensely fruity experience.
-Mild acidity accompanies the sugars in the finish.

Poured a cherry amber color with no head and very little carbonation.  Flavor is sweet, mix of cherries, crab Apple, cranberries, and a slight sourness which reminds me of being a kid working on an Apple orchard drinking fermented Apple cider.

Pour yields a reddish-brown colored brew with a short fizzy head that recedes somewhat quickly. The nose carries a strong bit of cherry and cranberry as well as underlying earthiness. Some tartness coming through, as well as fruit skin. Flavor is moderately tart but has far too much underlying sweetness.

Cuivrée, col beige moyen.
Arôme est agréablement fruité avec un mélange distinct et perceptible de pomme, canneberge et cerise qui sentrechoquent pour un bouquet bien balancé. Pointe de malt et touche sucrée caramel le tout gardant un soupçon daigreur fruité.
Palais met bien en évidence les trois fruits énoncés sur létiquette. On ressent le côté râpeux de la pomme, et laigreur de la cerise et canneberge. Tout cela est accompagné dun malt subtile et une amertume houblonnée qui vient juste en retrait du profil des fruits. Malheureusement le tout conserve ce côté plus jus de fruits, limite du cidre.

The flavor is very fruity, with apples up front, and cherry/berry flavors at the end.  Its very similar to Belgian Red, but more complex.  The apples give it additional sweetness, but the cranberries add a tart flavor.  Sorry Belgian Red and Raspberry Tart, but this might just be my new favorite New Glarus fruit beer!

Flavour is wonderfully complex, with the various fruits blending so well together, featuring notes of cranberries and cherries upfront, with the apple further back. No tartness and the sweetness is very restrained. The carbonation is suitably lively, sort of like a spritzer, which almost gives it a hint of spiciness, but more so in the mouthfeel rather than in the flavours.

The aroma is ultra fruity with tart red apples coming through strongest followed by sweet cherries and hints of cranberry and vanillins from the oak. Very mild, almost imperceptible oak character. Not very tart either, just fruity. The flavor follows suit with more sweet cherry that balances out the strong apple notes better than in the aroma. The cranberry is there, but I would have liked it to be stronger with some mouthwatering sour pucker, but no dice. It seems to have a better mouthfeel than Belgian Red. Not too syrupy. I probably would not have guessed this was oak aged. The fruit character is brilliant though. Vintage New Glarus. This probably ranks just above Belgian Red and just behind Raspberry Tart for me.

Maybe a bit more cranberry and tart apple than the cherries.  I pronounced tartness to this beer.  Absolutely wonderful fruit beer, that I prefer to the Belgian Red.

Aroma is a rich, fruity amalgamation of cranberries, cherries, and apples, smells naturally sweet.  Taste is rather carbonated with sweetness from the cherries and tartness from the cranberries, starts off a little tart and finishes rather dry.

It has a medium / full body thats quite lush and has a nice amount of flowing sharp  carbonation.  The flavor starts with crisp fruitiness that balances well with the sweet and sour notes.

The aroma is sour cranberries, cherries, and subtle chocolate like a chocolate puffed rice with hazelnuts.  The flavor is mostly the same.  Sour cranberries and tart cherries up front that last for most of the life of the sip.  Then, near the end, it morphs into a light chocolate, puffed rice, and hazelnuts.

503,"2012-11-23",3.8,"750 ml bottle purchased at Woodmans Foods in Onalaska, Wisconsin.  The pour is a mostly clear reddish, auburn color with a one inch light tan head which fell fairly quickly.  The aroma is all fruit, a pleasant blend of cherry initially, tart green apple, and the cranberry below that.  As I get past the fruit, there is a soft oak, and a lightly spiced yeast.  Fresh fruit nose.  The taste is the big and bright fruitiness of the nose - especially the cherry and apple.  Cranberry lends some nice tartness to the back, though this is mostly about the big bright sweet fruit flavors.  The oak is only barely present, and the spice yeast of the nose makes an appearance briefly in the finish.  The palate is medium to light bodied, spritzy carbonation, and the lingering fruity tart yeast finish.  Very much a cousin of the Belgian Red, this is a nice Fruit Beer.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

The aroma has a nice cidery quality to it with fresh cut apples dominating and tart cherries coming through and then a sort of dark fruitiness from the cranberries that give it a chocolatey personality. This beer has a ton going on, and does it quite well. Taste is sweet, dark fruity sweetness. The wild fermentation actually contributes little in the way of tartness.

503,"2012-11-10",4.0,"750 ml bottle from Woodmans (Kenosha, WI). Shared with Jess before we decided how much to lug home. Pours a rich reddish rusty hue, some healthy berry notes. Cherries, cranberries, raspberry hues show mellow haze and darkness in the body. Rusty coppery glow and berry hues on the edges. A big frothy lightly tinged copper head sits atop, laces well and sits around for the duration, growing smaller but making its presence felt. Aromas are lush fruit, lots of tart and sweet cranberry, gentle harvest apple. Cherryskins, sweet fruit and tartness all envelope the senses. Richer lush nose of cranberry, cherry, and fruit. A touch of toasty malts, kiss of earthy brown malt, biscuit. Lots of fruit. Initial is medium bodied, lighter silky tapestry of cranberry, tart and sweeter intermingling, apples are tart and fruity, some cherryskins and tart cherry fruit into the backend. Overall, a melange of juicy fruit, tart and sweet elements playing off of each other well. Well carbonated, prickly with raspberries, seedy cherries. Touches of biscuity, earthy, gentle kiss of darker malt beneath really sneaks through at times, which is pleasant. Tart cranberries, cherries, apples. Toasty crisp malts into center, and that odd yet really welcome dash of cocoa or brown malt feel further back. Really well put together experience, lush fruit beer. Tart and sweet play off each other well. Quite fun. Some odes to Belgian Red with the backend from the cherry in my opinion, but malty bit and tart big cranberry and mellow apple elements show up and give some nice play. Really nice.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
503,"2012-11-09",4.2,"750mL bottle, courtesy of New Glarus. Thanks, folks! Pours a deep, clear burgundy, like Pinot Noir with a fine-bubbled, perfectly formed light-pink head; modest retention and nice lacing. Rich, ripe cherries and apple character in the nose, offering some of the vibrancy of both Belgian Red and Apple Ale; modest acidity and a very light tartness; theres also a very distinct note here that takes me back to childhood: a hint of Play-Doh, dead on, thats apparently quite a volatile aromatic, quickly disappearing after a minute in the glass; the aromas left behind are magnificent. Medium body; moderate, very fine CO2; a mouthwatering acidity and soft citric tartness. Theres a whole lot going on in this beer, and a further departure from Belgian Red and Apple Ale than the aroma might suggest: assertive acidity, cherry Jolly Ranchers, black cherries and apple juice... plus a light lemon-curd lactic tartness, almonds and (finally) even a toasty, lightly dry core that emerges with further almond on the finish. A more-than-worthy substitute for Belgian Red.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
503,"2012-11-09",4.7,"EXCELLENT beer!  Wonderful fruity aroma.  Effervescent head.  Multiple fruit flavors on the sides of the tongue.  Only negative is that its so effervescent, itll easily cause huge belches.  Youve been warned!","San Diego, California, USA","o_Merlin_o"
503,"2012-11-04",4.4,"Enjoyed via a bottle from Discount Liquor. Pours a reddish brown with a medium, lacy head. The smell is of sparkling cider and berries. The taste is effervescent and so sour that it is prickly on the tongue. It is like Enigma and Belgian Red had a baby...one of my favorites from New Glarus.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","rbfishstick"

503,"2012-11-04",3.7,"UPDATED: SEP 2, 2013 November 4, 2012 bottle from casanova. Brownish red pour with big head that faded quickly and spotty lacing. Cranberry, apple and sour cherry in the aroma. Taste was tart apple and cherry start and the cranberry came in the finish. Light and easy to drink.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
503,"2012-11-03",4.0,"This beer has a very fruity aroma and cherries really shine through.   Carbonation is mild and this beer goes down quite smooth. Certainly a sour beer with no bitter aftertaste. Better than any cherry lambric I've had.

503,"2012-11-02",4.3,"Wow, thanks for sharing this with us Mr. Unwin. Nose is big cherry and green apple aroma with a light tart note. If you took cherry cough medicine and green apple jolly ranchers and mixed them together, thats sorta what this would smell like. Very fruity. Pour is deep pink/red colored with a clear bubbly head that disappears. Taste is all fruit. Tons of cherry and apple flavors with a light tart aspect. Very sweet but not overly so for this type of brew. Insane flavors here. I could drink this stuff all day.","Florida, USA","OmegaX"
503,"2012-11-02",4.4,"Shared by the generous fella at the CCB tasting. The body has shades of red with yellow edges to it - very nice. It smelled like cherry candies and fresh sliced apples. The taste had a very nice mixture of tart cranberries, and sour cherries that was perfectly dry with the light carbonation. Vanilla, apples and oak are in the finish, and the sweetness gives a great balance. I didnt see this one coming, and it is just fucking fantastic.","Florida, USA","Chipalsa"

503,"2012-10-28",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2013 Bottle @ Armins bachelor party. Thanks Caleb! Pours a cloudy reddish appearance with a cream colored head. The nose really smelled like Juicy Juice or a Cran-Apple juice thats tart with notes of spice, yeast, tons of oak, rich fruits. The fruits are very bright, fresh, and delicious in the flavor with notes of oak, tart cherries, green apples, spices, and tartness. Would love to try this baby again.

503,"2012-10-28",3.9,"750 ml bottle.  Poiurs a deep reddish color with a small white head.  Aroma is mostly tart cherries with touches of cranberry and apple mixed in.  Flavor still has a big, beautiful cherry flavor but is a bit tarter, balances everything out quite a bit.  More apple and cranberry come out as it opens up a bit more.  Medium bodied, finishes on the tart end.  Lovely.  Beautiful beer from the master of fruit beers.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"

503,"2012-10-27",4.4,"Bottle at home with my wife. Appearance is a beautiful crimson color with a small white head that quickly dissipated. Sweet raspberries, cranberries, green apples, tart cherries, light spice, and blueberries in the aroma Awesome fruity smell! Taste is much the same, super fruity, bright berries, tart cherries, red grapes, light wood, spice, cranberries, and pomegranate ending with a lightly tart finish. Medium body with high carbonation. Like drinking cranberry juice mixed with freshly squeezed apples, balanced perfectly with spice and malt. If this is an accident I hope there are more ""disasters"" like this in the future. My god this was a delicious beer!!!","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
503,"2012-10-27",4.0,"750ml bottle from Discount in Waukesha. Pours a very clear reddish-brown with a white head. Nice streaky lacing. Aroma has nicely distinct cherry, cranberry and apple notes, with some wood. Taste is of sweet tart cranberry and sour cherry, with some subtle apple contributing smoothness. Light body. Very wine-ish or a richer, less carbonated wine cooler - but with more fruit presence. Finishes sweet and tart, and stays around for a while. Very nice!","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"
503,"2012-10-27",4.2,"UPDATED: NOV 1, 2012 Bottle. Pours clear reddish ruby amber with a medium beige head that dissipates with some lacing. Aroma is strong cherry, with granny apple notes as well. Flavor is the same, quite sweet with some compensating tartness (cherry sweet tarts). Very much a fruit forward beer, with wonderully defined cherry notes. Not your typical beer, but quite yummy nonetheless.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"

Rich cherry upfront with sweet apple in middle....and a hint of the cranberry at the end....almost like a dessert wine...too much of a sweet thing to do a session but a great treat!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","dwm1034"
503,"2012-10-25",4.6,"Pours a dark reddish amber with a tall, creamy beige head that has great retention and leaves decent lacing. Huge, fruity aroma, lots of cherry, a hint of cranberry, light sweet bread spice, a little oak, sweet biscuit, hints of cereal grain. Some apple comes out in the aroma as it warms and the spicy notes become a little more noticeable. Great cherry and light cranberry flavors and tartness up front, cereal, light herbal and sweet bread/pie spice come in shortly after, some nice woody oak there as well, as it warms the apple comes out some more and the tartness and acidity are somewhat stronger, with something of a lactic or acetic feel to the acidity when it warms more. Liight to medium body with a light, blanketing and somewhat sharp carbonation and somewhat creamy, slightly sticky feel, leading to a slightly more dry finish with an acidic tingle. Amazing, easily one of my favorite New Glarus beers and one of my favorite fruit beers, hopefully it has a decent shelf life, or they decide to make it a year round release.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"
503,"2012-10-25",4.5,"Pours dark amber / red with good sized white head. Aroma is tart cherry. Very tart, made me cringe on first drink, in a good way. the initial cherry and oak flavors give way to slight apple juice taste leaving a sweet taste linger in your mouth afterwards. Its got a little bt of sour funkyness to it also. The cranberrys are not very pronounced but they add a little bitterness. Very crisp and refreshing, with prety heavy carbonation, almost like drinking champagne. This is every bit as good the other 2 great year round fruit beers if not better. Pretty amazing.","Iowa, USA","joshmcg000"

Very sweet, as is the norm with New Glarus fruit beers. Bottle label had me expecting something a bit more on the sour side, but this is even better.

503,"2012-10-20",4.0,"Bottle; Pour is fairly clear golden amber, with ruby highlighting;  the fine bubbled head is on the whitish side. The nose is apple and cherry - perhaps a hint of cranberry. I have to say I was expecting a blend of the three - but this one feels like a new brew and works pretty harmoniously. I like the depth of character, sweet, tart, and the wheat comes through - theres less of the barrel treatment than I was expecting - but overall ; another fantastic fruit beer from New Glarus","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
503,"2012-10-20",4.3,"This is the best fruit beer I have had. Can really get the cranberry scent and some cherry/apple in the background. Taste is similar, has a nice smooth texture of juice. I hope this one sticks!

503,"2012-10-18",3.8,"Bottle pours a bright deep ruby/amber with a small pinkish khaki head. Aroma is heavy on cranberries at first with cherries slight apple and a mellow oak presence. Cranberries and cherries are balanced very nicely combining for an enjoyable tartness with sweetness from the apple and all ending on oak notes. This is very enjoyable but I have to say it tastes like what youd expect from mixing different NG fruit beers together. Specifically Apple Ale, Cranbic, and Belgian Red. Less unique then one would think, still tasty though.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
503,"2012-10-17",4.0,"Bottle, shared. Pours pretty clear, dark purple with slight rust highlights. Small, wispy head. Nose is fresh berries, apple, slight tart cherry. Taste is similar: a little tart, very clean, a touch sweet. The acidity of all three fruits blends nicely here, which is really the beers crowning achievement. I could drink this all the time.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","jlruthven"
503,"2012-10-16",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 17, 2012 Just happened to get in on a trade the day this was released. Awesome. Ruby pour with a very small white head. Aroma, JAM. Apple, cherry, raspberry, toffee. Flavor is bursting with sweet fruit, apple pie/fritter, caramel, toffee, apple skin, and oak (vanilla mainly). Slightly sour finish, juice like, prickly carbonation. The only down side is I wouldnt want more than a 4 oz pour of this. Between 4 people we didnt even finish the bottle. Ended up mixing some with some grapefruit juice and sparkling mineral water, which was amazing. Trying to drink a ton of this would be like trying to get full off of foie gras. Yeah, you probably can, but its much better in small portions. Its just too rich and jammy, but the 4.1 Im giving it is well deserved. If you like the NG fruit beers, Id say this is the best one Ive had.","@ $13.99, Iowa, USA","DietPepsican"
503,"2012-10-15",4.1,"750ml bottle.  Deep murky burgundy. Quick fading beige-red head, soda-like carbonation bubbles rising to the top.  Sweet sugary cherry-apple aroma.  Big fruity tones, very reminiscent of the Belgian Red, but with some cranberry tartness in their.  The flavor is immense.  A really enjoyable beverage, but a little overbearing in its sweetness... more juice than beer at times.  Purple sweet tarts all the way.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
503,"2012-10-15",4.2,"Bottle.  A deep purple red pour.  Aroma is tart cran-apple.  Slightly floral and fragrant.  Flavor is a tart, yet sweet mix of green apple, cranberry, raspberry, and towards the end, a little cherry.  Sweetness does trail off leaving behind light fruit, wheat malt and vanilla.  Palate pretty well cleaned off for the next sip.  Still, a bit sweet.  Not as good as what its replacing, but still good.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"

Happy accident indeed! New Glarus took the poor cherry crop in 2012 in stride and came up with a new delicious brew. Serendipity pours a burnt reddish color with a slightly pink head. The scent is still mostly cherries but is overall very fruity and sweet smelling giving it that classic sour ale smell. Taste is sweet and fruity with all the main elements (cherry, cranberry, and apple) evident in the mix. Added to the mix was the great decision to age this in oak to make this an interesting, fruity, and delicious sour ale that is supposedly only to be around until Jan 1 in place of their usual Belgian Red. Get it while you can folks!","Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA","Lemke10"
503,"2012-10-14",4.4,"Poured from bottle, pours a dark ruby red with an off white soapy head, aroma has a ton of apple to start off, some cherry and the cranberry really didnt come through on the nose, the flavor literally has all three fruits together, all the apple and cherry comes through on the front end with a finish of the cranberries, sweet on the front and tart and sour in the finish, I am going to buy a ton of this.","Quad Cities, Illinois, USA","cbfobes"

503,"2012-10-13",4.3,"Bottle - Pours deep brown with a hint of red and a thin off white head. Nose is really pungent fruitiness, cherry coming through strong, but with a touch of cranberry tartness. The apple finally comes through in the taste, sweet and crisp, with real strong cherry in the middle, and the cranberry tartness coming through on the finish. Real sweet like the Belgian Red, so youve got to know that coming into it, but this is fantastic.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

Complex and a very enjoyable beer!","Wisconsin, USA","GhostFace"

The fruit flavors are more complex than the other two.  If you like the other fruit beers from New Glarus, youll like this.  Another fantastic fruit beer.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","sherm1016"
