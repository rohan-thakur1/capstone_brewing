505,"2017-05-27",4.1,"Had this one several times. From 750 ml bomber, on draught at the brewery, several beer festival and now the Thumbprint Series. Pours a hazy deep red amber colored brew with a hot pink head that slowly dissipates and leaves behind some excellent lacing. Aroma of mostly strawberries, golden grain malt, floral hops and a hint of rhubarb. Taste is full bodied, fruity, lots of strawberry and rich golden grain malt and a hint of floral hops. Finish is quite sweet with more strawberry and a hint of rhubarb aftertaste followed by some mild bitterness. Though I detected more strawberry flavors in the Thumbprint Series version compared to the former 750ml bomber, its still an outstanding fruit beer.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"

Light sweet start that is quickly whisk away by tart rhubarb that is quite similar to tart cherries. Very light on the palate, which along with the tartness leaves the mouth watering.

505,"2016-10-21",3.3,"Poured from a 750 ml bottle. 
Aroma is fruity with a rhubarb and strawberry character. Moderately strong syrupy, honey notes with a touch of a wet cardboard character. More rhubarb than strawberry with a faint phenolic note. 
Pours a murky, light brown color with a bit of a tan hue and a medium sized, fairly thick, tan head that slowly recedes to thin film that lingers on the edges. Light lacing and no legs. 
Flavor is very sweet with some moderate honey, caramel and syrup notes. Moderate rhubarb notes with some lighter strawberry character. Some light phenolic notes. A touch of wet cardboard notes. Low bitterness. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, the age hasnt helped this beer, but I am not sure it was very good in the first place. The beer is very sweet with some moderate fruit notes. Moderate oxidation and sweet malt notes.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
505,"2016-10-11",3.7,"At Hopishops B.U.M.B. 2016, shared by 77ships, cheers! Lightly lacing, egg-white, moussy head, lightly hazy orangey blonde robe with warm amberish hue. Aroma breathes a ton of ripe, sweet strawberries, home made strawberry jam, rhubarb stewed with lots of white sugar to soften the tartness like my grandmother used to do, more subtle notes of marmelade, apple cake, vanilla, banana and white bread lurking underneath. Very emphatic sweet strawberry flavor and though sugary, still feeling natural, not cloying as in an industrial sweet fruit beer; the sourish rhubarb flavor sits underneath but its hard to spot and could have been more outspoken if only to provide balance against the sweetness. Medium carbo (could have been a bit fizzier for such a sweet dessert beer, to my taste at least), some soapy wheatiness and soft, fluffy breadiness provide an underlying structure that carries the artisanal strawberry jam sweetness onwards. Slight earthiness in the very end, with the sweetness sticking a little bit to the throat. Like many of these New Glarus fruit beers apparently, this is very sweet, but in an elegant, refined kind of way - comparing this and the others with cheap industrial sweet fruit beers would be a lot like comparing grandmothers sweet strawberry cake with sticky, plasticy, industrial strawberry-flavored candy. It know which of those two I would prefer.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

505,"2016-08-15",4.5,"Three bottles consumed over 2013-late 2015. Usually I had this in a NG flute; I think its good to start it out fairly cold, especially if youre going to do the whole bottle by yourself (which I did with 2 of them) over an evening. It poured a murky brick-red to muddy brown, with plenty of fizzy head that died off fairly quickly...nose is, as expected, strawberry-rhubard, duh! But of course as with other NG fruit beers, its so fresh, so bold, so aromatic that the whole room lights up and I cant do anything but keep smelling, keep nosing, keep loving...its a bit less sweet on both the nose and tongue than the Belgian Red generally is, Id say, but perhaps more sweet than the Raspberry Tart or Serendipity, but what really stands out special about this one in comparison to the other masterpieces is the malt extraction, this has a fullness and biscuit-pie crust malt that provides a fuller and less acidic body than Im used to, making it simultaneously more quaffable at once in a glass or two, but a bit tougher to consume when talking the whole bottle. Theres also snatches of vanilla and caramel in here, and a hint of lime. I probably liked this more than the bottles Ive had of Serendipity, though I had that on draught once and it was otherworldly; as it is, its just another ""typically"" great experience from the American master of fruit beers. Im sorry to say it looks as if this might be gone for good; its listed as such on the website, and the clerk at the brewery a couple of weeks ago told me he didnt think it was coming back. But one never knows - the Apple Ale was out of circulation for a few years at one point. Bring it back, Dan!","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"

505,"2014-09-13",4.3,"Courtesy of Todd! Man, this stuff looks like caramel in a glass, its awesome looking, with fine lacing bubbles to round it out. Funky/stewed berries and rhubarb, light caramel sweetness, comforting dessert in a glass. Biting on the tongue, theres a spicy tang throughout with mellow/fruity sweetness to even things out. As it warms notes of fresh strawberry in the aroma, a little bit of greenery as well. Creamy with a spikey carbonation makes for a playful experience, finishes with a very pleasant fruity/berry note that dries out quickly giving way to toast/wood that lingers. Very NG in execution, would be hard to mistake for another brewer though feels a little less serious than some of the others Ive had from them recently... a bit less focused and more fun.

New Glarus Brewing 
Fruit beer
4% ABV 

APPEARANCE: Poured a murky, muddy brown color. Very slight reddish/pink variations around the rim and sides of the glass. With the smallest halo of a head that just kinda lazily dissipated into nothingness. 

AROMA: As I was pouring the smell of fresh made strawberry jam came rushing up at me. I got my nose in it and it literally smells like pie, you get the internees strawberry with nice hints of rhubarb. Then the malty pie crust comes through. This is one of the most intense bouquets I've had on a beer in a while. 

TASTE: Like little tiny Keebler elves are baking a fresh pie in my mouth! That jammy, sweet strawberry is undeniable. Nice bit of tartness from the rhubarb, then those sweet malty aromas I got come in with a good balance. This beer taste so fresh and juicy, it is sweet but not overly or artifice sweet. 

MOUTHFEEL: Light body with a medium prickly carbonation. Slightly sticky mouthfeel I'm assuming from all the sugars in the fruit. There is a slight creaminess that really makes it drink nicely. 

OVERALL: This was such a treat to drink, really enjoyed it. The only thing that kinda threw me off was the odd murky color but that's really just nit picking. I'm excited to get into the rest of the new glarus line up and see how they stack up against each other. I really do feel that new glarus is on top of the fruit beer world.

505,"2014-05-02",3.8,"Majority pour from ""1 Pint 9 Fl. Oz."" (presumably 750 mL) bottle, consumed on 5-1-14. I must have had this beer in my beer fridge for 4 to 8 months. Tart, yeasty aroma features scents of strawberry (a very heavy scent, in fact), caramel, and milk chocolate. The smell is mostly nice, but it is simple, and Im not sure strawberry is the right fit for a beer (whereas cherry and raspberry work quite well). I dont explicitly get rhubarb in the aroma. Cloudy, hazy, opaque liquid is tan / light brown in color. Small to moderate amount of short-lasting beige head. Pleasing, unusual look. Tart flavor features lemon and caramel elements. Sweetness from the strawberry, but it is a generic fruit sweetness, not necessarily explicitly strawberry in flavor. Bread / muffin / bagel flavors. Unexpectedly an English-style barleywine-like or pumpkin beer effect. Again, in the flavor, I dont specifically get rhubarb, but I certainly get tartness that could originate from the rhubarb. I love the tartness. Im less keen on the sweetness. Astringency at the back of the tongue. Acidic bite in the palate. Lively, smooth, and oily. Full bodied and filling. Strawberry Rhubarb is not as amazing as Belgian Red, Raspberry Tart, or Serendipity, largely because strawberry as a fruit simply doesnt work particularly well as a brewing ingredient, but the beer is nonetheless quite tasty, enjoyable, and interesting.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

Little hazy copper coloured beer, small aery off-white big bubbled head, unstable, non adhesive.

Taste: lots of strawberry yoghurt, pretty sweet and sugary, little citric acidity. Aftertaste: lots of rhubarb jam and strawberry jam, strawberry yoghurt, sugary and sweet with a nice citric ending. Well, it tasted like real fruit, even if its cooked real fruit. But its too sweet and sugary for my liking. The citric acidity in the end cuts a little through that, so youre not left with a cloying sugary mouth feeling, but thats not enough for me.

Medium body, velvety/syrupy texture, average/lively carbonation, pretty long finish with light bitterness. An odd one, maybe because its my first attempt with a New Glarus fruit beer. I can say the aroma is outstanding, not complex and multi-dimensional, but simply 100% enjoyable. Pretty sweet taste, and strange, almost syrupy mouthfeel.

Bottle: The aroma consists of huge strawberries and little else. It pours a cloudy orangish-brown with a small off-white head that fades to a thin film outlined by a thicker ring. The flavor starts with moderate-heavy sweet strawberry. The finish has light tart strawberry and lemon. Its medium bodied mild with moderate carbonation.

505,"2013-09-20",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 11, 2014 Bottle: Thanks, Jeff! Muddled, swampy brown, almost completely opaque with barely a head; off white film. Aroma is deliciously fruity. Not sure what rhubarb smells like, but this is ""berry"" centric, with lots and lots of strawberry; light tartness and delicate residual sweetness. Taste is like juice; strawberry juice with light jam notes, sugary sweetness, and only the mildest tartness in the very back. Thin bodied, tight carbonation. Though far from my favorite NG fruit beer, still pretty solid all around.
Update: Bumping up my rating of this; more recent bottles that Ive opened have had a larger rhubarb character with the strawberry shifting towards more of an undercurrent/periphery role, essentially giving the beer a brighter, zesty tartness throughout & toning down the sweetness from the first, most fresh batches I had.

Not bad (I enjoyed it), but why package that in a 750er?! 25cl bottles would be the perfect size to split over dessert...","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","mathieuc"

Since this was available as a draft line I decided to give it a shot before delving into some of the local offerings. I am glad I did because both in the bottle and keg this is a delicious fruit beer. Nothing short of rhubarb pie in a glass it is a fine addition to the New Glarus family.

Aroma / Appearance - A reddish base looks like someone whipped up a bloody mary then tossed on a rich head. Strawberry rhubarb pie tickles the senses along with a very subtle sourness. This is almost like candy in a glass but unlike sweetened lambics works because it has no pretensions of being anything but.

Flavor / Palate - The strawberries and rhubarbs also are strong in each sip. A mild sour tang is more salty than vinegar. Far too easy to drink in just a couple of gulps this beer is fantastic from the time it gets to you to the last drop. If passing through Wisconsin pick up a couple.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Too good.","Florida, USA","OmegaX"
505,"2013-08-31",3.2,"A steady pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a two finger thick, light tan colored head that seems to be quite creamy textured; as I drink the beer it leaves quite a bit of layered lacing on the sides of my glass. The beer is a dark, plum-red color that shows a brilliantly clear, bright, gold-tinged, red hue when held up to the light. The nose smells brightly of strawberries, like a concentrate, coulis of strawberries. There is perhaps an earthiness here that suggests at the malt from the base beer here, and there is also a touch of tartness to the aroma.

As expected the beer is sweet, though not quite as cloying as I was dreading. The strawberry flavors play the dominant role in the flavor to, though it is not quite as dominant as it is in the nose. There is prickly carbonation to the beer, which helps to offset the richness of the body; this definitely sits on the palate quite a bit, it is quite chewy textured, but it is still drinkable enough. Trying to reach for a sense of the base beer here, it is quite hard though, perhaps a touch of almost nutty, malt character, though you really have to dig for this. The beer has a soft tartness to it that melds with the strawberry character; I dont really get a sense of the rhubarb, but that is always the case with this kind of combination.

In the same vein as the other Fruit beers from New Glarus, sweet, fruity, without much beer character to it. If that is what you are looking for these can definitely hit the spot, and can certainly be enjoyable as such.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Nice sweet, tart strawberry on the tongue with rhubarb coming through beautifully in the lingering aftertaste. Like drinking a strawberry-rhubarb pie beer. Light body, average carbonation.

In fact, exactly like that. Distant, vague maltiness. The flavor is more of the same. Amazing authentic fruit character almost syrupy but stopping just short of being too sweet and cloying. Typical New Glarus. This is probably the most authentic strawberry character Ive ever had in a beer.

A touch jammy but more tart, strikes quite the nice balance. Middle is a touch sweeter, some jam, brown malt middle, some gentle toastiness, earth, and biscuits. Jammy strawberry, seedy, less tart and a touch earthy. Backend is tart again, lemony, citrusy, strawberry lemonade. Almost a bit of acidity. Tart rhubarb, earth, a touch green and earthy. Dry and tart. Finish is tart, a touchs sticky. I must say, the body on this one is much lighter, more summery and crushable than the bit more brooding, cocoa and brown malt Serendipity. Tartness is at a good stronger level, lemony, tart, and just a touch sticky. I wouldnt say this particular beer is the most assertive or potent of the New Glarus fruit family, but its my favorite in flavor and palate. Nose could use a touch more intensity, its pretty nice as it settles but not as potent as some of the others. Very nice beer here.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
505,"2013-07-30",4.3,"Bottle. Pours is a murky red, nice head. Aroma is overwhelmingly strawberry. Flavor is strawberry, some tartness. Creamy, tart, fruity and awesome. Could ddrink this all day long.","Robbinsdale, Minnesota, USA","TheHOFF43"
505,"2013-07-30",4.3,"This pours a reddish amber color with a fluffy cream colored head. There is a very strong aroma of strawberries. The taste is a sweet clash of strawberries and rhubarb. It basically reminded me of a strawberry fruit roll-up from when I was a kid only in a beer form. I dont see this having quite the hype as Belgian Red, Raspberry Tart, or Serendipity but its still quite good.","Waukesha, Wisconsin, USA","Lemke10"
505,"2013-07-29",4.4,"From the bottle thanks to ElGaucho! Fantastic pour out of the bottle with a big foamy pink head on a ruby fill. The aroma is very fruity and you get a ton of strawberries, but there is a bit metal scent left that is unfortunate. Taste is big strawberry jam and finishes with a slight tartness from the rhubarb (and I almost want more sour! Overall, a killer beer!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","falco242"
505,"2013-07-28",3.9,"Bottle @ home shared by Jake. Bright red pour with minimal off-white head. Enormous strawberry jam nose. Sweet fruit, mild rhubarb, and light tartness. Tons and tons of strawberry flavor. Smuckers strawberry jam, slight rhubarb and bubblegum, and a subtle tartness.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
505,"2013-07-28",4.2,"Bottle thanks to khoffman43! Hazy reddish brown pour, small ring of medium carbonation and an aroma of fresh strawberries. Flavor is also nice strawberry, tempered by a little tart rhubarb and nice malt and a little biscuity. Really nice, hope to pick up another bottle or two of this if I can.","Eden Prairie, Minnesota, USA","DalzAle"
505,"2013-07-28",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 5, 2017 Muddy brown color. Aroma of strawberries and tart rhubarb. Thus is an amazingly good beer. Sour, tart, fruity. One of the best of the New Glarus fruit beers I have had. If you see it, this is a must buy.---Rated via Beer Buddy for iPhone re rate for 2017 release","Wisconsin, USA","akoeninger"
505,"2013-07-28",4.2,"Magic in a bottle Dan knows his way around fruit beers. Slightly hazy reddish brown pour with a big white head. Nose is like snorting strawberry rhubarb jam. Tart, yet tamed by the strawberry. Excellent beer - hope to see it every summer!","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
505,"2013-07-28",3.7,"Bottle. Pours muddy reddish brown, nice sudsy white head. Nose is juicy strawberry for days, a little tartness from the rhubarb, with a hint of lactic nature from the wild brown base. Follows the MO of the New Glarus beers: super fruity, a hint of sourness to prop it up. Creamy mouthfeel, like strawberry pie. Such a hard fruit to balance the sweetness of, and I feel like they mostly succeeded. Couldnt drink much though.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","jlruthven"
505,"2013-07-27",4.2,"750 ml bottle shared with the wife. Pours unclear dark amber brown with a tight foamy sudsy khaki head that slowly settles to sudsy film and subtle lacing. Aroma has noticeable strawberry and tart sour scents with malt and I get the scent of cherry chapstick. Taste is pure strawberries that are tart with malt and the rhubarb is not really present to me, but damn it tastes good! Palate is medium fizzy carbonation and finishes dry. Really nice fruit beer!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"
505,"2013-07-27",3.9,"Sample from a bomber from sherm1016. Thanks! Another fruit winner from New Glarus. Nose is the strawberry....but not too much. The rhubarb tart is in the taste and aftertaste. Not too sweet but definitely strawberry....wonderful on a steamy summer evening.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","dwm1034"

Tastes so sweet yet light and refreshing. The perfect amount of strawberry and rhubarb, without being overpowering. Crisp and refreshing.","Wisconsin, USA","MarinEvelyn"
505,"2013-07-26",3.8,"Pours hazy copper and red with some lacing white head. Aroma of sweet strawberry and tart rhubarb. Flavor is crisp sweet tart and finishes cleanly. Delicious tart beer. Wont quite call it a sour but overall delicious beer.","Madison, USA","jmcgavin12"
505,"2013-07-25",3.9,"Bottle : I enjoyed the green wax on this bottle for some reason (Red/Green Color Combination for the Strawberry/ Rhubarb) : Pour is hazy golden brown with amber highlights in this glass, while revealing a moderate off white head here with average retention and mild lacing present. But you know the program - I doubt the base beer varies from the others ; the moral of the story is that you have yet another incredible flavor profile thanks to the strawberry rhubarb combo. The nose was a stunner on this one ; the combo comes through quite nicely - its robust and clear. There is more depth, with a solid earthy, musty note present. Again, it has a champagne style mouthfeel in a way, with a very prevalant fruit presence, nice malty backbone, and a lingering finish. I felt like the nose was the highlight here, but it still drank quite nicely (And yes, Raspberry still ""wins"" in my book)","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
505,"2013-07-24",4.3,"750mL bottle. Poured clear medium raspberry with a pink-tinted head.. looked great! The aroma picked up semi-sweet strawberries paired with rhubarb and some funky, fruity yeast.. really nice strawberry and earthy character on the back of the nose.. tangy and engaging. The flavor opened with tart rhubarb and funky yeast, with strawberry seeds and light bready notes behind.. tart fruit skins, strawberry seeds, dry funk, and a kiss of champagne-like effervescence on the finish. Medium-bodied with high-ish carbonation on the palate.. moderate tartness-sourness the whole way.. dried out and was very refreshing on the finish.. great stuff!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
505,"2013-07-23",4.0,"Shared 750. Slightly hazy brown/orange with a hint of red. Absolutely intoxicating aroma of strawberries and cream. Tastes like strawberries with a little sour and zing. Another amazing fruit brew from NG.","Erin, Wisconsin, USA","demmbonz"
505,"2013-07-23",3.9,"Bottle. Pours to a hazy ruby brown body with a moderate foamy off-white head. The aroma is like a strawberry rhubarb pie and a light sour beer. The flavor is quite good. Definitely sweet strawberries, but it isnt sickly sweet. Theyre definitely balanced by a tart savory rhubarb and pie like component. Nearly like there is lactose sugar in this one to top it off with ""ice cream"". Very wholesome and like liquid pie. Rich palate, but not sickly sweet.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
505,"2013-07-23",3.4,"750-ml bottle from Tenutas, (quite) a step up from CVS. strawberry, balanced, not too tart, full body,","Illinois, USA","zebra"
505,"2013-07-21",3.5,"Orangish-brown pour with off-white head. Lots of carbonation. Nose is big, fresh, sweet strawberry and cream/vanilla, with a little tart rhubarb. Flavor sweet strawberry with softly tart rhubarb. Light vegetal/herbal notes from the rhubarb. Light, somewhat syrupy body. Fruit character is great, but too sweet. Not enough tart to balance. All-in-all another successful NG fruit beer, but best enjoyed in small quantities. Interesting to see what it would be like when the strawberry falls off a bit.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
505,"2013-07-20",3.7,"Bottle - Pours murky brown with a thin filmy light tan head. Nose is lots of fresh pie strawberries and pie filling, lighty soured malt, and a tiuch of tartness. Dont really get the rhubarb. Taste is a mix of strawberry sweetness and sour rhubarb, with the strawberry jelly of pie filling and a bit of crust. Finishes a bit sour and tart, but still pretty sweet. Soft and full in the mouth, with real nice carbonation. Not my favorite NG fruit beer, but its tasty.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
505,"2013-07-20",4.0,"750ml bottle from Brunos in Lake Geneva, split with the family. Pours a clear, reddish brown color with an off white head and some lacing. Aroma is fruity, strawberry. Medium on the palate with soft, creamy carbonation. Flavor is sweet, fruity, strawberry, light tartness, maybe some rhubarb, with a light strawberry finish. Reminds me of the Belgian Red moreso than the others. Another well made fruit beer from New Glarus.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","sherm1016"
505,"2013-07-19",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 25, 2013 Full disclosure: I fucking LOVE rhubarb, and strawberry rhubarb pie is probably my favorite dessert of all time, so I am predisposed to love this beer - pours a medium red with a light haze and a thick, soapy lace - nose of sweet, fresh strawberry character, along with a balancing acidity, both from the rhubarb and the fermentation - there is also a mild, somewhat wild kind of funk to it - very fresh, summery aroma that showcases the fruit well - low carbonation, but very full in the mouth - bracing acid up front is followed by an explosion of sweet strawberry on the palate - mild funkiness follows, finishing with the light tang of the rhubarb and some closing acidity (lactic, even a touch acetic) that lingers on the palate - I quite like this, but again, I had a bias coming in - mmmm.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
505,"2013-07-18",3.9,"Poured from green waxed dipped 750ml purchased from the hilltop brewery, pours a hazy reddish brown with a really thin off white head and just a little bit of lacing, the aroma is of really fresh sweet strawberries right away but it kind of fades away into a little funkiness as well, the flavor much like the aroma has a forward amount of fresh picked strawberries with the tartness of the rhubarb in the finish, the finish is pretty dry, the more it warms the more tart and sour it gets, really starts to open up once it sits there a little bit. All around its solid and enjoyable, doesnt really hold up to Serendipity but it sure is drinkable. Well done.","Quad Cities, Illinois, USA","cbfobes"
