3638,"2010-08-22",3.6,"A: The pour is a slightly cloudy, light amber color with a white head on top.

S: The nose blew me away; this might be an English style beer, but its all American hops. Lots of citrus hops (lemons, grapefruit, and tangerines?) with a hint of pine and perhaps even some pineapple notes. A light bready quality as you would certainly expect.

T: The flavor is similarly impressive. The bitterness provides a nice counterpoint to the bread and slightly sweet malt notes. The citrus flavors are once again intense and vibrant.

M: The body is maybe a little bit light, with a moderate to high level of carbonation.

D: This is just a very easy to drink and enjoy beer. Solid hop character thats not really accurate for the style, but tastes phenomenal.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

The flavor is dry and quaffable with medium hop bitterness and some toasty malt.   Light earthiness and clean fermentation.   A very sessionable pale ale, though not really enough malt or yeast character to be properly English style, and not hoppy enough to be anywhere near as good as Russian Rivers other pale ales.

The beer pours a crystal clear golden color with a one-finger white head.  Some lacing on the glass.

Nice aroma.  Earth and citrusy hops stand out most.  Some malty sweetness stands in the background, and there are some appleish light fruit notes.

A little restrained on the flavor compared to the other offerings from Russian River, but hey, its an English bitter, not an imperial IPA.  Slightly sweet malty notes - mostly pale malt, with only slight caramel - as well as earthy, herbal, and orangey hops.  Medium bitterness.  Balanced.

Clean and crisp on the palate.  Medium-light body with appropriate carbonation level.

Clearly expressed, earthy and floral hop aroma; an attendant, red apple-like fruitiness from the yeast; the malt core is really nicely dry and quiet here, contributing just a touch of biscuit-like maltiness; well-rounded, mineral-tinged, earthy hop aroma is key here. Medium-light body; medium-high carbonation; no alcohol, of course; a very light creaminess, and entirely non-astringent; moderate levels of acidity keep this strongly alive in the mouth; near-perfect texture in the mouth; medium-high levels of earthy and floral bitterness and flavor; a light biscuit-like maltiness; modest levels of an apple fruitiness; everything follows the aroma; perfectly well attenuated, and an ideal amount of heft in the mouthfeel for the flavor profile; this feels good to drink. Beautiful, crystal-clear presentation of well-rounded English hop character on a soft, biscuity base.
