Nice bourbon coconut vanilla nose on top of the hazelnutty base beer. This beer took to the barrel pretty well considering its only been in barrels less than two weeks, per bartender Abby. Flavor again has the bourbon, but in the fresher variety, which, to me, is usually perceived as hot or boozy (which isnt the case here), vs the old oxidized type a la LA Angels Share. Not boozy here at all. A little less coconut, still has vanilla and plenty of hazelnut and some chocolate notes. Semi-dry, bitterness peaked at a 2-3. Low smooth carbonation with a light to medium body. Did not disappoint.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
