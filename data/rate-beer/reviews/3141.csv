The pour is a hazy golden yellow with a thinner white head and some decent lace. The aroma is really interesting. There is a lot of peach and sour funkiness to it. At the same time, there is a lot of oak and a light grassiness on the back end. This is good, but I was hoping for a lot more. The flavor is a little better. There is a ton of peach. Light, tart, and sour peach with a decent barnyard funkiness to it and a dusty hay thing happening on the finish. The mouth feel is light and crisp with an effervescent carbonation and a lingeringly sour, peachy, sharp aftertaste.

Aroma has a rich tart/acidic peach with a funkiness backing. Flavor has lots of sour peach with a touch of lemon and light funk.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","deyholla"
3141,"2014-06-24",4.3,"And so for my 100th Missouri rate, in honor of the Ratebeer Summer Gathering 2014, with thanks to the good folks at Perennial & Side Projec, to Peter, Kier, Aaron, and Will. I present to you my interpretation of the scralled out chicken scratch notes I took while drinking this beer in the corner a barrel storage space. 

Pours a very hazy bright golden with a decent enough head. 

The aroma is deep funky with nice fruity & lemony notes. The beer has a nice fresh peachiness which somehow blends harmoniously with the barnyard funkiness and mustiness. 

The flavor is bracingly tart, its got white grape and peach fruity notes. The beer is nicely sour, perhaps on the high end of sour without going overboard and leaving out any vinegar like character. The oakiness is mild but well employed & the beer is all together a delightfully refreshing and complex beast. 

Fantastic.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"
3141,"2014-06-24",4.1,"Bottle @ Perennial. Hazy golden pour with a tall white head. Super fresh, juicy peach nose. Hints of lemon juice and green apple. Some light oak and white wine as well. The peach flavor is great, but the lactic sourness is just too aggressive to be a supremely crushable beer. A nice juicy fruit sort of tropical character and some nice grass and damp wood funk.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3141,"2014-06-23",4.0,"Sampled along the RBSG 2014 bus tour. Bottle at the brewery. Holy crazy sour and peach fruitiness in the nose. Amazing peach expression. Dry, tart, and fruity with some stone fruit (apricot) as well. Very puckering and that would be my only knock on this beer is that the acetic, chest burning sourness is a touch too much, but amazes me that there is so much peach despite this.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
3141,"2014-06-23",3.9,"Bottle - So much peach you can feel the fuzz. Hazy light yellow with a bubbly white head. Sour and tart peach with quite a bit of funk (I had the dregs). Great beer, but that much peach is too much for me.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
3141,"2014-06-21",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 1, 2014 Bottle @ Perennial during RBSG. Gusher. Pours a hazy light yellow appearance with a bubbly white head. A shit load of peaches / apricots in the nose. Funk, Brett, oak, and effervescence prevalent in the nose as well. This was pretty sour but didnt disintegrate my throat like an Upland sour, for instance. Plenty of funk, tropical fruits, pineapple, white grapes, vanilla and of course, peaches in the flavor. A bit of cheese as well. Loved the funk. Some found it one dimensional but I was thoroughly impressed with the beer. Very enjoyable. Update from Doodler bottle: top 10 ive ever had.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"

3141,"2014-05-25",4.1,"Bottle; Pour is slightly murky light golden with a spritzy, fine bubbled one finger white head into this glass - it retains well - with sticky lacing presence. The nose is a stunner in this glass - lemon cake, vinous notes, grass and light peppering spice, moving to a light fruits from the peach addition . The flavor profile reveals a more prototypical sour feeling out of the gate - that sweet tart lemon, with a puckering sweetness, peach moves to a lingering white wine, more grassy hops, with a very long finish that is nearly perfect for me - I feel like the nose has more depth, but the flavor profile was awesome as well.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

3141,"2014-04-23",4.2,"Pours lightly hazy yellow with a small white head that leaves quickly. The aroma has lots of peaches, swirls of vanilla, raw oakiness, bugginess, tart character and a nice juiciness to it. It has a medium / light body with lots of carbonation that does not interfere with the flavor. It starts off with sharp peach with a nice sour side that has some citrus and lactic sourness. There is also some vinegar and hints of the white wine although the barrel aspects on the aroma arent as prevalent in the taste. The finish has a burst of peach and lemon is very refreshing. There is no way Id guess this is 8% abv. Drinks as easily as the 5% sours and lambics. Very well done.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
3141,"2014-04-16",4.6,"375ml bottle shared by Cory last week, what a sweetheart!

Pours a golden yellow color, light eggshell head, thin ring around the glass and some wisps on top. Nose is peaches...not just peaches, but the most amazing peach note Ive ever smelled in a beer, no doubt. Along with the fresh peaches, theres a nice tart citrus acidity, oak, nice funkiness. Flavor is the perfect mix of tartness from the sour base with the most insane natural peach note Ive ever tasted. The barrel charter is light, good acidity without being over-the-top. Light body, soft carbonation thats just right, dry finish.

Probably the best American Wild Ive had in a couple of years and better than Yellow Bus (when it was fresh). Basically, the best peach-based sour Ive ever had and definitely the most memorable beer Ive had so far in 2014. Great work, Cory...believe the hype.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Sean9689"
3141,"2014-01-09",3.9,"Enjoyed at FOBAB 13 in Chicago. Pours a light yellow with white head. Smells of peach and funk. Taste is funk, tart acidity, and tons of peaches.

3141,"2013-11-19",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 3, 2014 Draft sample at FOBAB 2013. Pours a hazy peach color with a finger of frothy eggshell white head. Notes of peach, grapes, yogurt, cheese, wheat, dough oak, chardonnay, and plenty of funk. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a tart, vinous, funky mouthfeel. The peaches take a little bit to do their thing. But this was very nice once it opened up after a few minutes. Gold medal winner, too. Pretty neate. Re-Rate: Confirming earlier rating. Bottled one this time. Peachy and acidic. Really nice.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
3141,"2013-11-18",3.8,"On tap at FoBAB 2013 (Chicago, IL). Pours a nice dulled golden peachy hue, well hazed with dulled frothy whitish loose head atop. Dies down, laces ok. A bit dulled, the aromas throw some more impressive lactic acidity, subtle brett. Lemon and yogurt meet some spritzy sourness, white peach and some bread. Nice firmly assertive sour fruit vibe. Initial is a bit more full, grainy middle shows a medium body, some nice tart sour lemon up front dies out. Some oak, bready and grainy middle. The backend takes on a much more assertive sourness, lactic and white peach elements, yogurt and more lemon. Really nice backend lightens this up, completes this. Some firm sourness really grows back there, the peaches develop and really do there thing as we get further into the glass. A bigger pour is necessary for this one. A bit ugly on the pour, the nose is solid, but the backend and finish really take the cake here. As an aside here, I was surprised this won the Gold in Acedic Sour based on the competition I found. I easily thought the other Side Project sour was better than this today and while this beer certainly came on into the backend, the front was a bit dead. Maybe the judges had the keg at a different point than I did? I did share a pitcher with Cory when I first had this though. Still, a nice beer with a lot of potential as he possibly fine tunes the front and nose. Even with that disclaimer, I still gave it a pretty high score as its a very good beer.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
