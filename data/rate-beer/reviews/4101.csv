4101,"2011-08-27",3.9,"Bottle. Pours a clear copper color with a coastered white. Decent head retention. Some fruit in the nose, sweet, and nail polish acidic. Soft sweet start followed by a sour fruit flavor. Not as sour as the SF Wild #4 but probably more balanced. Light mouthfeel with carbonation. Winelike and dry. Overall, this is pretty tasty and decenly balanced.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"

4101,"2011-04-14",1.9,"Thanks to Alex for breaking this beer out and challenging my stomachs will to live. After this, Im certainly going to seek out #6 for an even better esophagus-eroding experience. Served in a Savor snifter.

Pours a peach-orange color without any head formation or lacing. Im guessing something lurking inside this brew killed all of those things. The nose is really, really, really pungent with strong notes of mustard and horseradish. Damn, this is sour. I swear I thought it was going to start making my nose bleed.

The flavor is just a potpourri of different acetic condiments with a lot of strong mustard coming initially and then finishing with a really large amount of vinegar-heavy ketchup. The feel is just ridiculously, over-the-top sour. Not bad in its own right, but it was accompanied by what was more of a hot-sauce presence in the finish. Drinkability was hard, as I really didnt enjoy the nose or flavor of this and the feel made my stomach churn, but I had a really good time drinking this and would do so again.

My favorite quite about this one goes out to Sean for describing this as smelling and tasting like ""nuclear armadillo hairs.""

4101,"2011-04-03",3.7,"A solid pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces a three-finger, glass filling, pale amber tinged head.  The beer is a full amber color that shows an almost brilliantly clear, red-plum color when held up to the light.  The aroma smells like a tart, floral, ripe red apple that has a back note of urea (like that found in a good Gueuze), woody mushroom notes play backdrop along with a touch of cracker like whole grain and a touch of mustiness. Unripened notes of startfruit start to come out after a short while and so does a hint of vegetal like character. 

The beer starts out light tart, but then the sourness starts to seep into the palate and by the time my first sip is done my mouth has been gripped by an aggressive, bracing, literally mouth-puckering sourness.  Interestingly enough, at this point at least (with the beer being on the cold side), the beer seems to be soured by lactic acid; the characteristic bite of acetic acid doesnt have nearly the hold on this beer that it has in many of the other Wild series of beers.  Ok, what else is here besides bombastic sourness; touches of floral apple character are noticeable, as the beer warms perhaps a touch of plastic like phenolics as well as a bright berry like fruitiness that is even more apparent if you lick your lips after a sip.  The spritzy carbonation also provides some carbonic bite to this beer (like it needed any more) which matches the light, but somewhat viscous (a lactic slickness perhaps) body that this beer has.  The oak was quite overwhelmed by the sourness at first, but as the beer warms up it at first starts to add a tannic astringency to the finish, then there is a soft, oral-nasal woodiness and perhaps a roundness that is not quite buttery oak.  This does have a certain piquancy to the finish that suggest at acetic acid, it becomes more noticeable as the beer warms, but it is never huge and aggressive enough to suggest that most of the sourness of this brew is from the lactic acidity.

 

I am quite happy that the lactic character is what supplies the gripping sourness as lactic acidity is always that much more smooth (even when aggressive like it is here) than acetic acid is.  This beer is quite nice, I was a bit scared after the #6, which was just way to acetic, but I am easily enjoying this beer; the acetic character here provides an added dimension beyond the bracing lactic tartness and helps to accentuate the fruitiness of this brew.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
4101,"2011-03-30",3.6,"Thanks to Alex for this...Pour a muddy orange with about a finger of white head...The aroma is really astringent here, it literally burns my nostril hairs if I keep it there long enough. Its buttery, burnt popcorn, rubber, very acidic. Unlike the 6 which I liked as a vinegar bomb this just wasnt right...The taste is quite sour, reminds me of a lighter version of the 6, I can see there is a progression of the sourness. Reminds me of vinegar and catchup, after talking a few drinks I feel like I just a huge basket of fish and chips. I like this type of sourness, would love to find out how they do this.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

4101,"2010-11-05",4.0,"Bottle Tower of Power Sour Hour Deel Twee This beer rocks! Mostly clear amber ale with a small, fizzy, white head. The bouquet consists of funky cheese, grilled sirloin tips and the fresh rubber soles on a recently purchased pair of sneakers. Medium to full-bodied with jazzy carbonation. The flavor is intensely sour and fruity  tropical mélange and a blend of peach and apricot. There is tasty malt sweetness, but it is so very out-trumped by the beers intense acidity. Even at room temperature, the outstanding flavor is as sour as all get-out with only a touch of malt sweetness. Finishes sour and lightly sweet.  Big-time kudos to Dstructo for sharing this world class wild ale!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
4101,"2010-10-30",2.5,"murky tan, creamy white head. Eggy eccentricity and some heavy acidity. More acetic in the flavor, heavy lemon, light sweat and stink, also light bitterness. Not much fruit or nuance, just more of that heavy, enamel stripping acidity, puckering and burning as it crawls down the throat. Not as painful as the #4, but still lacking drinkability and complexity. Personally cant stand the Santa Fe sours Ive had.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

4101,"2010-08-30",3.8,"22oz courtesy of ygtbsm94. Wow another knock out from Santa Fe. Appearance is certainly not unblended lambic: there is a massive geuze like head that towers high in the Cantillon tumbler above a cloudy deepish amber color. Aroma is malty, funky, cream of wheat, some vinaigrette, citrus fruits. Taste is a powerful acedic sour, Granny Smith apples, apple cider vinegar, full sour, almost spicy/prickly on the palate.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

The beer pours a yellow color with a white head. The aroma is lemons with some tartness and burnt popcorn notes. The flavor is sour lemons with some nice oak character. I also get some sour apples notes. This beer is very sour, though not quite as acidic as the Wild Ale. 4 from Santa Fe. Still I think this one was a little bit better since I got more flavors in addition to the sourness. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
