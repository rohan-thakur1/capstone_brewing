Fraaie licht troebele oranje kleur, met een sprankelende snel verdwijnende witte schuimkraag. Droge en frisse aroma's van sinaasappel, limoen, hooi, Brett gist, paardendeken, witte wijn, champagne. Zeer levendige carbonatie, zurige droge en vineuze smaak, haast champagne achtig. Met tonen van limoen, eikenhout, groene appels, gras, paardendeken en leer. Mooie complexe Geuze, behoorlijk zuur, maar ook zeer verfrissend, met een licht hopbitter smaak van grapefruit voor de balans in de afdronk. Een prachtig product, van Brouwerij F. Boon.

357,"2016-05-30",2.8,"750mL bottled 3/26/15, drunk 5/21/16.Large white head shows moderately-strong to strong retention atop a burnished copper-golden body. Why do Boons lambic have more color to them than 3F and Cantillon? Well, I know the answer, and I dont care for it.Cork, leather, must, MASSIVE green apple and white grape in the nose with damp hay and mold. Smells just like Boon Gueuze and that is to say, very underwhelming. Why do I want a noseful of cork and green apple? If I wanted to smell acetaldehyde, Id just buy a macro lager....Low on charm, it just smells old already, with none of the brighter, lighter, daintier brett and lacto notes of the better gueuzeries.Flavor follows, with ample, mostly engaging carbonation and a very mild saccharine character. Hay, wheat, cork, leather and more green apple. Just not something Id ever want to drink again given the far inferiority to almost all of the other lambic producers.  Barely cared to finish my small sample and certainly didnt want seconds, despite paying $20 for the bottle.Its nice that Boon produces a lot of lambic but hopefully with the upswing of lambic popularity, the lower quality producers start to get driven out (going to be a while before that happens, but one can hope).","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The cork explodes off the bottle in an ambitious attempt to obliterate your eyeball. You pour the beer into the glass - and if you drink gueuze out of the bottle you deserve to DIAF - and it makes a sound. The sound of bubbles popping livelily (word? dont care). Where do you rate the sound of a beer? This one gets a five, because its a rare non-quiet beer. Quiet is overrated.

357,"2016-04-10",3.9,"UPDATED: AUG 7, 2016 As Black Label, 14C. A loud pop but not a gusher. 2 inch head settles down to cm and lasts better than any geueze I can recall. Slightly hazy orange-gold. High bead. Aroma is fairly funky and has under-ripe white nectarines, lemon, damp laundry, hints of woody spices. 8 Quite fizzy. A bit much really, but it certainly makes the Champagne comparison work - dry, crackery, moussey texture. Crackers, nectarines. A fair bit of lemony sourness, apricots and their stones, moderate funk. Pretty elegant drop. [3.9]As yellow-labelled Boon / Mikkeller Oude Geuze Boon, Bone Dry Mikkeller Selection. Enthusiastic cork. Mild gusher. Clear gold with a white head that fades to a cm and then is gone. Vivid funky aroma with old lemon, the barn, under-ripe nectarines, apricots and their stones. Carbonation is high but not wildly excessive. Quite sour with lemons and spiced wood but with stone fruit in the background. Perhaps a little less intense than suggested by the aroma. Dry but not obviously notably so at the end. Leaving the score the same although its not as pretty. Bought this thinking it had been unaliased - nobody drinks even really good beer twice, right?

But hey I always thought my Uncle Alf was my grandfather, so go figure. Anyway a fitting beer to salute both gentlemen. Slight haze to a golden beer with a lasting white head. Clearly very high carbonation as the beer is still going crazy in my glass some minutes after pouring it. Classic Boon geuze aroma in that its so lovely. Sweeter than some, great funk, horse blanket and farmyard, some sour lemon. In the mouth its amazing. Effortless, yet the lemon curd, lemon meringue pie flavour makes you want to weep. Its stunning. The depth of the aroma, the beauty of the fruit in the mouth, I mean its frankly amazing. In 11 years this is one of the best beers Ive drunk. So well balanced, so drinkable and yet so cultivated. A little lemon yoghurt flavour. Finish has more sweet lemon and a little fizzy carbonation. I knew it would be good, and it is.

357,"2016-03-07",4.5,"Pours a hazy orange color, with a huge, white head, slowly fading to a still fizzy lacing. Beautiful beer, with its lacing coating the beers surface the whole time

Offers a flowery, mineral coated funkiness with lots of moldy earth, old leather and a nice, lemony tartness. Fruity lemon directly adds to the profound funky qualities, revealing yogurt, potato peel, and slightly fermented vegetables. Its mineralic note ties the aromas well together, creating an awesome, fruit topped, complex nose.

Has a lively, bubbly carbonation, which remains soft on the tongue. Finishes surprisingly clean, focussed on citrus, which unfolded a pungent funkiness on the palate before, and malts. Drinks very refreshing, while offering a great, sour complexity, which shines due to it balance, preventing it from becoming too acidic.

Soft earth, old oak, white lemon zest and a toffee note build the foundation of this. Wet grass, moldy woodbark and crisper turning citrus challenge silk yogurt, a stony mineralic quality and cream cheese together with old straw. Cheese turns stronger after the swallow while the beer shines as for its very soft mouthfeel, featuring grass, old leaves, tart lemon and toffee malts. This leads to a surprisingly clean finish, reviving its mineral quality from the nose together with a long lasting citrus tartness.

Wow, a true masterpiece, by far the best Gueuze by Boon Ive had so far. Its taste defining lemon tartness is really amped up, while getting wrapped up into wet leaves and a well accentuated funkiness, creating a nice balance. Its fantastic finish leaves me speechless, as it turns around the beers intense flavor profile so far, and replaces it with a simple but well working silkness, benefitting from the still recognizable lemon presence.","GERMANY","aleigator"

357,"2016-03-05",4.4,"Limited edition of Boon Oude Geuze almost entirely made with lambic that was brewed in Frank Boons new brewhouse. Cork popped out of the bottle with a very loud bang even before I was finished removing the muselet, but there is no gushing, just a cloud of vapor escaping from the neck - the genie is out of the bottle, lets say. Very loudly (as in: audibly from a distance) crackling, thick, egg-white, irregular head dissipating quickly, residing over a warm, lightly orangey old gold robe with vivid, champenoise sparkling and an equally divided haze of pale, tiny yeast bits. Musty aroma of all the good lambic qualities, all working well together: dusty cellar, unripe gooseberry, fermenting hay, very old dry white wine, mouldy lemon, damp earth, ureum (not in the least disturbing - in fact, integrated in the whole lambic funkiness as it should be), sour grapes, old cheese, yuzu, dried mushroom, straw, bread crumbs buried somewhere underneath, cava, old furniture, redcurrant and even something weirdly soapy every now and then (and its not the glass, for all clarity...), as well as a delicate hint of vanilla, which I suppose represents the oak tannins. Extremely crisp and spritzy onset, coarse, stinging carbonation, enlivening the palate immediately; citrus acidity comes up strongly, puckering a bit which I am not used to from Boon lambics, but softening after that; all kinds of sour fruit flavours abound, grapefruit, lime, gooseberry, unripe green plum, grape peel, persisting till deep into the throat. In the middle, a supple yet surprisingly filling backbone of soapy wheat and bready barley provide a firm structure; sour yoghurt-like lactic acidity lies underneath the crisp lemon acidity and dries the mouth. This drying effect is aided by the sharp carbonation and indeed, as is apparently the intention, this geuze ends extremely dry, more so than other Boon geuzes (and literally making my mouth water as a result), with a fairly strong drying wood effect and late, deep but very effectively bittering hops at the back. There is a glow of warming alcohol after all this, but it remains so subtle that it does not at all distract from the rest - intrusive alcohol flavour would obviously be a disaster in this case (or in all lambics, for that matter); instead, it adds body and a kind of creamy feeling in the end, which is unexpected but enjoyable enough. The late, earthy, old hop bitterness lasts for a long time but remains deaf, adding only bitterness in balance with the sourness, but no aroma, as is to be expected from a traditional lambic. The unmistakable leathery Brett flavour, present from the start, lingers in the mouth and nose after swallowing the last drop.  This is a great geuze, indeed different from most other Boon products in being notably drier, spritzier and a bit heavier on the tongue. Not one for beginners I think, but I would love to compare this with the regular oude geuze and the Mariage Parfait to see which one stands out - for the time being and to my personal taste, this is probably the most amazing Boon geuze I had so far.  The bottle was empty before I even noticed - fortunately I have a tendency to murder to dissect.  As for that Mikkeller version: I saw it sitting next to this one in the Struise shop in Bruges last week and hesitated to buy it - fortunately I didnt, since I meanwhile found out that both are actually the same.  Not sure what Mikkeller has to do with this geuze, but I dont see the point in using two different labels for it, I guess the Mikkeller version is intended for export to Denmark or something?","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Taste is a slight let down. It is very dry, very understated. Some funk, moderately tart and sour, slight white wine vinous, light apple.

As far the taste goes, it is impossible to get past the point of insanely big carbonation, truly excessive, ridiculously so, really over-carbonated, most carbonated drink (not just beer) I have possibly ever had, it makes it hard to drink & hard to even taste.
