Aroma is brett off the bat, very funky and barnyard, citrusy. The taste is brett, but with some spices, juniper is definitely there, want to say sage, but that is probably the juniper bush, it actually tastes like a dried up sage and or juniper bush i would imagine would taste like, the touch of smoke adds a ashy finish to the beer. Different and good, never heard of using a whole bush to brew beer, i wonder if they broke it up at all or just threw full bushes in the boil?","Idaho, USA","Beerdrinker79"

Yet another beer from Stillwater that has seemingly changed contracts, at least for the CO market (nothing about ""Import Series"" on my sample either).

The flavor still has a decent amount of juniper, but the flavor is much more dominated by the brett at this point. There might be a touch of smoke on the finish, but its pretty light.

I can tell by the nose that this is my kind of beer ! The palate follows the nose beautifully with nice complexity and balance between funky, rustic, fruity, spicy, refreshing, yet bold.  Getting a bit more sourness and juniper on the midpalate and a nice spicy smokey finish that lingers just enough to bring it back to its earthy existence !","Gray, Maine, USA","Lukaduke"

The head retention is excellent, and theres a good amount of lacing left on the glass.  Aroma is fruity and spicy, it smells like citrus (orange, lemon peel), bready malt/wheat, cloves, juniper, peppery spice and a little bit of funk.  Smells like a mix between a hefeweizen and a saison.  The brew tastes like peppery spice, orange and lemon peel, wheat, and a bit of an herbal/flowery flavor.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit creamy with high but soft carbonation.  I think this is a good overall brew, I think its worth a try.

Pours a hazy dark golden yelowish color with banana hues and a two finger frothy, pillowy white head that very slowly fades into a lasting cap. Streaks and spots of lace left behind.

Slightly earthy aroma with funky yeast and subtle musty Brett. The juniper is evident as well but doesnt overpower, letting the brett and saison yeast shine. Some bready yeast and light fruit notes in the nose. 

Medium bodied but on the fuller end with a nice creamy texture followed by subtle barnyard funk and musty Brett. Not overpowering or too dry. The saison elements are  still evident with bready yeast, grass, straw and light fruit especially apple and pear.  Juniper gives slight earthy, spicy character but doesnt overwhelm. Well balanced with the Brett adding a crisp, funky dryness that gives it depth and complexity. Pretty good saison thats easy to drink.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"
