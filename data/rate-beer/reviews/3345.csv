Sweet and juicy, orange-mango-papaa juice with a bit of malt. Like it, but does it taste like beer? Bit of cracker, honey, biscuit. Touch of hop spiciness and pepper. Very tasty, but A little too much just like fruit juice for me to really appreciate it. Quite sweet as well.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"

Flavors, again Mosaic, moderate bittering, some citrus, and some maltiness emerges from mid palate. Medium body.

Pours extremely milky orange with a long-sustaining bone white head with curtains of lace. Taste is lightly bitter with juicy citrus flavors. Carbonation seems soft.

3345,"2016-08-29",4.2,"32 oz crowler, filled at the brewery. Huge thanks to luttonm for handling the courier services on this one. I owe you! I was waiting to share this with somebody, but like many IPAs, I felt the clock was ticking in the crowler. Besides, after the first sip of this, I knew 32 oz would last me about an inning of the baseball game, especially if the Ms cant seem to record an out. The better the beer, the worse the game goes. Its a tough battle for me. Pours a shiny golden color with a lasting archipelago foam head. Im surprised this is a solitary Mosaic hopped beer. A much juicier, tropical fruit profile than I have picked up from other single hops of the same. I expected the juicy side of this based on the name, but that was before I knew anything really about it. First impression is an orange slices, super fruit constant. Orange juice like late mouthfeel. Makes me feel like this beer would go great for breakfast. I always preferred a juicy session IPA over a coffee beer when it comes time to drinking beer before the tap places open up. What a perfect fit to the category this one is. Second pint of this crowler was even better than the first. So much delicious fruity hop flavor that keeps you downing this beer. In no way does this taste like it is a session. It has a full IPA flavor and a good amount of bitterness throughout. So many things are right with this beer. Its a shame I havent been to Great Notion to try one of these fantastic beers on site. That being said, with this one beer, you have made a fan. Excellent stuff.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"

3345,"2016-08-09",3.7,"Crowler @ Monkish. Murky golden beer with a white head. With a name like this, I expected some serious juice. Instead, its more of just a kind of straightforward, ""traditional"" session IPA/pale ale thats ugly. Lots of citrus rind, some pine, a bit of dank, and herbs. Big time orange peel here. Moderate bitterness. Decent mouthfeel, at least. Has a bit of stone fruit and tropical fruit sweetness, too. Some notes of zesty citrus. Its a nice enough beer, but not anything groundbreaking.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

3345,"2016-07-12",3.3,"One I had said 6%. Not sure how that constitutes session. Maybe ask Chazz Cordova or Brent enloe. They could probably tell you. At least it's east coast style. Nose of pencil erasers and papaya, soft grain and white sugar. Pours hazy golden yellow white head. Flavors are mostly pencil erasers papaya and some juicy hops. Dry finish of rubber and dank. Lighter bodied than their others but the whole pencil eraser took away a pleasant experience otherwise.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"

3345,"2016-03-16",3.6,"On tap @ Great Notion. Pours heavily hazy golden yellow with thick lacy white head. Aroma is thin pale malt, big lemony citrus hops. Taste is nice lemon/orange citrus notes up front, grainy earthy malt lingers through the finish. This is close to escaping the session IPA curse, but shows a bit harsh through the finish. Not quite as good as Ripe or Juice Box, and hardly a season IPA in the usual sense of the word. Still, tasty beer.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"
