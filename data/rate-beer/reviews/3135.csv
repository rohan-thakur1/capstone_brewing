Smacked in my face with the tart raspberries, a bit of funk and wood, much sourness in an acetic kind of way. This is like I asked Crooked Stave to brew a beer with exactly the proper mix of ingredients that I wanted them to and they did it. Beer of 2017 for me? Perhaps.","Casper, Wyoming, USA","Bill Becker"
3135,"2017-06-18",3.7,"Une bière brune foncée, plutôt opaque avec des reflets rubis, sans grande carbonatation. Au nez, les framboises se manifestent bien avec avec un côté réglisse noire également. Les levures sauvages sont également bien présentes, rappelant en quelque sorte une oud bruin. En bouche, les framboises dominent franchement, avec une bonne effervescence ainsi quun goût chocolaté un peu surprenant. Il y a également un côté fort alcoolisé provenant du vieillissement en barriques. Difficile à boire, bière compliquée, complexe. La bière a une finale boisée et un peu amère, terminant le tout dune façon encore plus complexe.","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","LouisP"

The nose is a really interesting combination of dark roast and coffee, vanilla and cinnamon whiskey, and tart raspberry candy, with an added tart funk that contains both lemon and a hint of vinegar. The flavor is primarily sour, with all of the citrus, hint of vinegar, and tart raspberry up front, moving to some of the milk chocolate, vanilla, and cinnamon whiskey, along with the somewhat bitter roasted coffee on the back of the palate.

3135,"2016-08-22",4.6,"My Bottom Line:
Leather-bound raspberries envelop the palate with juiciness and sourness in this superbly flavorful creation.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slim ring of foam circles the darkened blood red.
-Mouthfeel is silky and juicy, though the intensity of the sourness decreases drinkability somewhat. Eat some creamy goat cheese with it and it all becomes heavenly.
-A touch of chocolate is imagined as well.
-The nose points to a sweeter beer (oaken vanilla notes), but the flavour profile and texture have nothing sweet to showcase. This is all about fruit, acidity and luxury.
-Body is very dry as well.
-Whisky blends in perfectly.
-Carbonation is practically absent, which takes this beer even closer to the world of wine.

3135,"2016-05-09",3.7,"Bottle from wchesser -- cheers! Dark sour complexity thats taken even further into strange territory by the raspberries. Its got a good amount of funk and acidic bite, and the berry fruitiness is definitely apparent. It tastes a bit like Nyquil, but very interesting, funky, probably organic Nyquil. If organic, funky Nyquil isnt a thing yet and you think it sounds good -- go buy some of this beer!","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"

3135,"2016-04-20",4.1,"Dark blackish purple with reddish violet head... Aroma of raspberry jam, roasted malts, dark fruits, acetic notes... Flavor is roasted malts, sour raspberries, leather... Raspberry notes overpower whiskey barrel aging, still present but much more subdued... Original a bit better, but still delicious

3135,"2016-04-05",3.9,"Appearance: pours with a small pink head that settles quickly, the beer is a very dark ruby color, almost black
Aroma: raspberry, egg, some warmth and some other aroma I can't put my finger on from the whisky is apparent, funk
Taste: very sour throughout, has a strong tartness as well, raspberry sweetness followed by the slightest hint of alcohol, wood
Palate: soft carbonation, leaves mouth dry, minimal tart aftertaste, medium to heavy mouthfeel 
Overall: this is quite interesting in both the aroma and the taste, but mostly the aroma, very sour, hides abv well
