Nose of caramel malts, vanilla, and floral hops. Medium plus body. Flavor is big on bourbon and the vanilla and the finish is citrus and floral. Excellent.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"

Taste was a mix of grain, bread, caramel, toffee, slight vanilla into some slight spice, finishing slightly watery, slightly sweet.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
2494,"2016-03-15",3.5,"16 oz. capped aluminum bottle from shrubber85- thanks again, Roger! 2015 vintage. Pours a deep but not opaque slightly browned mahogany with a small off-white head that fizzles into a ring and a film relatively quickly. Aroma of oak, toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, earth, vanilla, molasses, dried dark fruits, tobacco, and tea - doesnt really pop like youd expect, but has layers of unexpected depth. The flavor, though, doesnt deliver much - toffee, cola, wood, light bourbon warmth throughout, earth, tea, and dark fruits. Medium-plus bodied, with moderate carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Its good and smooth and nice to sip, but its too restrained to be truly memorable.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
2494,"2016-02-06",4.2,"Rating #1680 - #CBC2015 Beer 65 - Day 4 - Draught at one of the parking lot events. Rich blackbrown pour with a creamy tan head that bubbles away quickly. Aroma is roast malts, vanilla, hint of chocolate and weak coffee, mild nuttiness (almond). Mild carbonation, medium-heavy alcohol warmth, little yeasty whiff as well. Palate is more malt character, nutty, chocolatey, vanilla oakey Pappy textures shine through. Phenomenal.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","bulldogops"

2494,"2015-06-02",4.0,"Arizona Canned Beer Festival 2015. Bottle shaped can pours up with a clear brown body that supports a tan head. The aroma offers up big smooth bourbon sort of rum like notes flowing into coconut and mild sweet dark fruity esters. The taste is smooth and similar with soft brown sugar and prune sweetened bourbon and coconut. To midway it finds a faint vanilla sweetness to go along with all of the other sweet notes. Great sipper where the bourbon and booze have just enough sharpness to help cut into the sweetness to add a semblance of balance.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
2494,"2015-05-28",4.1,"Purchased 5/20/15 from Sun King - 16oz screwtop can poured into 3F Tetsu glass on 5/24/15. Clear ruby/brown pour with an off-white frothy head. Nearly all bourbon on the nose - some vanilla and toffee notes. A bit thinner than expected, but plenty of flavor - again, mostly bourbon with hints of the dopplebocks malts in the background. Very good beer - but the price made me feel like I was paying more for the Van Winkle name than Sun Kings side of the ledger. I wish they had amped up their Bock to stand up to the barrel more. Still - I strongly recommend trying this delicious brew.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","Overml01"

2494,"2015-05-16",3.8,"Can. Deep burgundy hue with a silly khaki head. Nice barrel aroma -- smooth vanilla and toasted coconut, toffee, raisin and fig. Earthy hops in the background. The harmonious blend carries into the flavor, where whiskey, wood, caramel, bubblegum and raisin blend. The flavors a little more muddled than the nose. Creamy medium body; high, pinching CO2. Tasty stuff -- might be the first barrel-aged canned beer Ive ever had.","","PartyFowle"
2494,"2015-04-30",3.5,"Draft to plastic cup at Sun King. Looks decent; a fairly transparent amberish brown with very thin off-white lacing. Good carbonation though. Smells good; a smooth blend of caramel, oak, vanilla, and mild bourbon. Tastes like it smells, but not as rich or robust. Mouthfeel is medium to medium full-bodied. Solid overall, but the taste of the beer is really underwhelming compared to the nose.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"

Lovely nose with dopplebock malty lager undertones with a sweet brown sugar and oak char tone with bourbon and pork and toast. Wonderful flavor of rich malty toasty dopplebock with bourbon, oak char, vanilla, brown sugar, and boozy toasted bread malts. Really swell and complimentary.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
2494,"2014-05-27",3.4,"60 ounce can, supplied by WillRunForBeer. Many thanks! Opened at his Merrimac flat. To fist-sized shot glass, it pours a chestnut-tinted light dark brown; only a line of suds shown on top. Aromas of dried cranberries, blackberry purée, muscovado sugar, tobacco, burnt cotton, and German yeast. Tastes the same with the addition of plums, sugarcane, and chalk.

2494,"2013-11-24",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 5, 2014 Can - Dark maple pour with thin white head. Nose of booze, malt, and light vanilla. Taste follows. Not sure if this style is conducive to barrel aging. It comes off so thin like Velvet Merkin, although it tastes much better than VM.

2494,"2013-11-18",3.8,"From picnic tap, to pitcher, to fest glass at FOBAB 2013, with a fairly clear, brownish amber color, and a modest, light tan layer as head foam. Bourbon throughout, but never hot. Toast, caramel sweetness, a touch of toffee, and barrel notes with some extracted vanilla, were noticeably present in both aroma & taste. A bit of hop bitterness still snuck in, while some dried fruit seemed to lend extra sweetness to the flavor. Smooth, maybe somewhere between medium & full bodied, but very tasty!

Herbal/grassy hoppy notes in the flavor that are fairly well masked by the delicious bourbon, caramel, and toffee flavors. Not something I would normally be attracted to, but Christ, this was fucken delicious.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"

2494,"2012-12-23",3.8,"Sample FOBAB 12 - Friend grabbed this one - didnt sound like my cup of tea, but what the hey - clear amber pour, not much of a head.  Aroma is inviting - roasty yet sweet with toffee, caramel, some booze, vanilla - pretty good overall.  Flavor is intriguing and somewhat light, but it works - oak is prevalent, roasted malt, coffee, toffee...lots of little things making a solid whole.
