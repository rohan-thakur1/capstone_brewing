 Kolor:  Ciemno brązowy, klarowny z rubinowymi refleksami. 
 Piana:  Kremowa, zbita, tworząca jedną warstwę.
Szybko kurczy się i zatrzymuje na poziomie 1 krótkiego krążka. Przy przechylaniu szkła widać trochę malunków na ściankach. 
 Zapach:  W aromacie czuć prażony jęczmień, gęstą czekoladę i ziarna kawy.
Nuty prażone przeplatają się z nutami palonymi.
Na zapleczu odrobina karmeli i cukru trzcinowego. 
 Smak:  W smaku mocno palone, wręcz popiołowe. Sporo ciemnych słodów i kwaskowatej kawy z mocnym finiszem.
Czekolady jest tylko minimum, odrobina ciemnych owoców i szczypta lukrecji.
Goryczka długa, ściągająca, drażniąca język.

 Podsumowanie:  

Imperial Stout ze szwedzkiego Browaru Nils Oscar to tak na prawdę FES.
Kiedyś piwo było wybierane najlepszym piwem na świecie w swoim stylu podczas World Beer Cup.
Dzisiaj jest cieniem swojego pierwowzoru.
Największa porażka jest okropnie wodnista tekstura, która w niczym nie przypomina topowych FES-ów.

But... it fades away really quick, and I dont get that much of after taste.

Dark, roasted malt notes and coffee followed by dark chocolate & fruits with some sweetness coming from them and some sugar. The aroma is verging on that of a foreign export stout.

Black with a tanned brown head that is thumb sized initially before settling as a thin lacing on the top of the beer.

Dark chocolate and dried fruits to begin, along with some coffee along this isnt as strong as I was expecting. There is some sweetness that follows this with some sugar, vanilla and caramel.

Medium and smooth with a great balance between the sweetness and the roasted bitterness. Carbonation is light-medium carbonation that is just about right. The alcohol is well hidden too.

A good stout that falls somewhere in between a traditional English one and a Russian imperial one yet also hints at a foreign export one in places.

3.0 A: Black color. Half a finger of frothy tan head. Retention is poor and just a tiny ring of lacing is left.

4.5 S: Like the coffee stout, this is wildly earthy. Mineral, mountain stream water, clay, general woodziness. Supple roast, subtle coffee, plenty of dark chocolate, a touch of caramel. Fairly dry, but not too dry. Really nice nose on this.

4.0 T: Pretty much like the nose, but it doesnt impress me as much. The flavors are less bold than the nose suggest. Still, its quite tasty. Mineral, mountain water, outdoors. Moderate roast, subtle coffee and chocolate, and a touch of caramel. Again mainly dry with just a touch of balancing sweetness.

Smooth, silky, creamy mouthfeel, with a slight milky aspect, full bodied but not as oily / thick as many imp. stouts.  Flavor is big on raisin and fig, with a roast chocolate aspect, and even apple / pear tones on the finish, which is long and ultimately ends on a subtly bitter roast.

dry and chalky. &nbsp Not as full in body or mouthfeel as other examples. &nbsp Could pass as a really robust porter, except for the fact that its really really roasty. &nbsp I tend to think Imperial Stouts as being a bit heavier, which

Flavor follows, very bright and fruity with balanced roast, acidity, chocolate maltiness.  Some chewy tootsie-roll doughy quality as well , soft round and fruity.  The hard-roast coffee acidity is perfect without any of the tannic bitterness.  Wonderful very slight rich alcohol warmth in the finish.

The bitterness in the finish is almost woodsy as opposed to straight roast. Very good drinking. To summarize, far from big and bold, this is a leaner more finessed take on the style, very well put together, and characterized by the subtleties of dark malts that typically gets lost in other examples.

1956,"2009-02-19",3.2,"Maybe the ""Imperial Stout"" in the name is throwing me off because this isnt working as well as id hoped.  Aroma is pretty good- smoky alcohol with a little chocolate sweetness.  It appears to be a little thin, especially the head, kind of like a flat Coca-Cola.  Flavor is just not all that special- dark malts, coffee, molasses, maybe some brown sugar sweetness- the smoke and graininess are working to make this stand out but it just falls short of my expectations.  The palate is decent but there is some thinness or something lacking.  I shouldnt be dogging this so much, its a solid beer, just not for $5.79.  I should also note that ive been sick so maybe that is influencing my judgment.

1956,"2009-02-05",4.0,"THOUGHTS: My first Swedish beer. A nice chocolaty beer. Definitely more of a foreign stout than an impy stout. Nice, but not the best foreign stout Ive ever had, I thought. But then, oops. It actually was nicer than I thought. I just had it a little too cold at first.
TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a clear, dark brown that was black in the glass and dark red when held to the light. It had an average tan head that mostly diminished and left good lacing. The aroma was moderate to heavy coffee, chocolate syrup and cocoa powder along with some dark, sour fruit. The flavor started sweet, lightly bitter and sour; and  finished sour and bitter with and average duration. There was both milk and dark chocolate, cocoa powder, and dark, slightly sour fruit, then a little bitter chocolate. The medium to full body was slightly oily, but also creamy with fizzy carbonation and a chalky and light to moderately astringent finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

I have been cellaring this for a few months.  Deciding now was as good a time as any to try one of my two bottles I cracked it open.  What I discovered was a solid imperial stout.  It may not be spectacular or as complex as the big boys but I can’t wait to see what a few years does to the other bottle.

Aroma / Appearance - A short lived ashen head decorated a deep black body that swirled gracefully around my snifter.  Without being oily a nice layer of lacing gave it some presence.  Peanut butter, coffee and smoke are the strongest players in the aroma.  Cherry, chocolate and dark malts assist in forming a rich dense but not cloying experience.

Flavor / Palate - The impression of strong black coffee shocked my tongue into paying closer attention.  Warm smoke, raspberries and dried expresso beans were next.  The third wave was chocolate and more coffee.  Lingering after the coffee the chocolate finish gave a nice closure to the taste.  While not my favorite imperial stout this was certainly well made and deserving of praise.  Give it a shot if you can track it down.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

A delicious result from 5 years of cellaring. Rating: 7-4-8-4-15-3.8. (081229)Bottle. It pours a lovely black body topped by a dense beige to tan head. Nice lacings too. The beer is more flavorful than I remember, and the aroma likewise. A bit thin though. Theres a lot of darkness in the aroma, with quite evident licorice, as well as roasted malt, coffee and chocolate. Good dash of sweetness too. It feels full-bodied at first sip, but it isnt so full. Quite stickysweet though, and not so dry, even though theres mocha, coffee and roasted malts. Some faint chocolate too. I would like more hoppy bitterness and some fruityness in the beer, as it is quite low on that. The alcohol can be detected, and gives a little warmth, but it sure isnt forcing itselves through. Its a surprisingly easy drinkable beer, but considering its 7% ABV, not a session beer. The sweetness of it also suggests its not a session beer, and its still a little weak if youre looking for a real treat by the fireplace in the winter, or as a nightcap on a hot summer evening. Guess that leaves it somewhere in the middle, not that I know what that would be. Maybe the last beer before leaving the pub? (080605)","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

1956,"2008-03-28",3.5,"A vigorous pour produces a fat-one-finger thick, frothy, lightly brown tinged, tan colored head.  The beer is near black, but shows flashes of brilliantly clear, deep ruby notes around the edges if held up directly to the light.  The aroma is somewhat rich with lots of dark malt character; aromas of chocolate, well toasted rich grain notes, a touch of dark roast coffee, a touch of charcoal, and some earthy, dusty burnt grain husk aromatics.  Underneath the dark malt is a touch of burnt fruit character reminiscent of overly broiled raisins and prunes.

Somewhat light feeling for an Imperial Stout, but well within character for a stout of 7% abv.  The beer is quite roast dominated with burnt malts providing both a touch of acidity and a palate coating, dry burnt character up front.  This palate coating burnt note is counter balanced and somewhat washed away by a sweetness that takes hold towards the middle into the finish and which provides flavors of burnt, sweet plums and roast raisins.  This has a fair amount of sweetness to it, especially as it warms up; the sweetness is perhaps not as rich and malty as I prefer in an Imperial Stout, but is instead more like a fruit-forward, clean sweetness.  This has a fairly low carbonation (thus the minimal head despite a vigorous pour), this makes this a bit smoother drinking.  The beer has a medium heft to it, enough to coat the palate just a bit, but not enough to keep this from being fairly drinkable.

As a contemporary Imperial Stout this seems quite week, but even ten years ago this was a decent strength version.  A tasty brew that seems a bit more like a strong stout.  I almost feel like I could quaff a couple pints of this brew, which says something both about the strength and the flavor of this brew.  Tasty!

Another (fairly) newly imported scandanavian brewery. Nils Oscars Imperial Stout produces a one finger tan head on an aggressive pour that fades rather quickly to a skimming with a thick ring. Leaves some respectable lacing on its way down. The head formed on top of a coal black body with faint mahogany highlights when directly backlit.

The smell right upfront is a nice deep roastiness. This lays down the foundation for an alcohol spiciness and a lactic quality. Im not sure what type of hops were used but I seem to pick up a touc hof pine toward the back. Smells good but a little on the faint side. Seems more along the lines of a few foreign stouts sampled in the past.

Flavor follows in stride with the aroma. Things start off with a rich roastiness that, although fades, is with you through the remainder. Mid-palate mild coffee with cream take hold and things end with a welcomed sweetness from the lactic quality. Again, the flavor is more reminiscent of foreign stouts sample in the past than most RISs Ive drank.

The mouthfeel is particularly nice. The body has some heft but isnt too big, which fits the smaler size of this beer. Smooth and slick with a creamy finish.

This is an easily approachable RIS that also keeps it easy drinking. The lower abv, for style, allows you to drink a couple in a sitting.

Another good Imperial Stout from Scandanavia. The flavors present and lower abv still bring to mind a foreign style stout but this is definately an enjoyable brew. Im anxious to try others from Nils Oscar.

Overall, this beer is a bit of a disappointment, and my second such disappointment in as many beers from Nils Oscar.  Flavor and nose do improve considerably with warming, though theyre still a tad thin.  This obviously rates well, so maybe this beers a hit-or-miss/year-to-year type brew that lacks consistency.  I dont know.  But it just doesnt cut it with the best imperial stouts, or even the second tier (very good) imperials.

1956,"2007-07-02",4.3,"2001. A very impressive parade from the glass reveals an oily, still well carbonated very dark brown body with chestnut and red hues. Just a touch of a tan head forms then quickly recedes, but its obviously adequately carbonated and very lively despite its advanced age. The aroma of dark fruits and aged malts is evident as soon as the bottle is opened. Present are notes of wonderful smoke that seems to ride forward in waves atop copious roasted grains. The combination of smokey and roasty grains create a meaty, beefy even, sensation. Dark fruits such as plums, prunes and raisins meld with anise and earthy vines. Caramel is present but reserved. Alcohol is almost unnoticeable. Chocolate notes, both bittersweet and dark and dry round out a stunning aroma, in just as good of shape as the appearance of the body. I still have yet to taste a beer from this brewery and Im wildly impressed already. The flavor is moderately smokey, moderately sweet, still very complex and has just hints of drying alcoholic bitterness. Sweetness from caramel flavors is fresh and riddled with spicy nuances. The mouthfeel has definitely taken a hit from the long slumber and thinned some, but is very smooth, complicated and just plain fun to drink. Carbonation is mild but spritzy and gives the flavor an upbeat tempo. The finish is a soft blend of caramel, chocolate and smoke, all lingering in unison and fading ever so softly away. An incredibly solid beer. Definitely on the small side for an imperial stout but a truly enjoyable beer. I had a great time sampling this and will certainly seek it out again.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Aroma has sharp salty soy notes, esspresso, dark chocolate, roasted notes and delicious fudge brownie kind of smell. Dark brown to black body with a quickly diminishing wispy mocha head. Very sharp and bitter in the fore, but it is a burnt bitter not a hoppy bitter. Lots of dark chocolate flavors that are both sweet and bitter. Its pretty thin on the palate, but the incredible intensity of flavor moderates that a little.

1956,"2004-06-09",3.5,"BB June 2008.  Thick, powerful garnet body with a fluffy, tan head.  Sweet, grainy malt aroma with chocolate, caramel, toasted grains, nuts and loaves of freshly baked bread.  There isnt much vinous character or even alcohol in the nose, but Im not too disappointed.  The body is smooth and very creamy, but not as big or rounded as one would like.  The flavors are enjoyable, but rather indicative of the aroma.  Nothing is big and overbearing as some Imperials are, but whats here is tasty and well balanced.  The problem is that some key elements are missing.  Being not as sweet in the malt, lacking the strong hops and without the vinous fruity character I cant help but feel a little let down.  Many thanks to Jeppe for sending this all the way from Denmark.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

1956,"2004-03-22",3.5,"Dark walnut with rusty edges. Very light. Persistently creamy tan ring. Meaty, roasty aroma with plenty of licorce and dark grapes. Subdued dried plum and caramel couple with substantial smoke and dark chocolate. Masked airiness flirts with the subtle charred malts and tar. Firm body. Minimal, soft carbonation. Earthy yeast backbone is swiftly quelled by the lightly acidic black malts and excessive roastiness. Wax and tingly licorice remain in the background. Finishes softly, filmy, and fairly vinous, yet with a sharp, lightly acrid black malt edge, which enriches the roastiness. Hints of leathery malts, cotton, caramel, and toast. Roasted barley, smoke, and black malts linger underneath the earthy, buttery yeast. Well-integrated roasted and charred malts, but rather simplistic. Overall,  the intense roastiness all-too abruptly shortens the finish and  pretty much overwhelms the mocha, caramel, rich malts, dark fruits, etc., which I happen to seek in this style. Solid and interesting, but its missing body and heft, in particular.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
