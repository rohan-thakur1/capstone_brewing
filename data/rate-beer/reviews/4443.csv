Czerwony kolor z piękno różową pianą. Piana okala całe szkło pozostawiając liczne wstęgi.
Aromat zdominowany przez kwaśne owoce. Czarna porzeczka, malina, lekka mineralność. W smaku sok z kwaśnych malin zmieszany z dżemem z porzeczek. W drugim rzucie delikatna stajnia i wiejskie klimaty. Pod spodem kapka drewna.
Umiarkowanie kwaśne, owocowe, super pijalne.
