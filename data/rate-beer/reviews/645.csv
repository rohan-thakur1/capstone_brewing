645,"2017-06-12",4.0,"Zwart bier met beige schuimkraag. Geur: chocolade en hazelnoten, precies vloeibare Nutella. Smaak: melkchocolade, hazelnoten en vanille. (pindanoten of niet, ik ruik en smaak hazelnoten). Licht volmondig, romig, glad. Matige koolzuurprikkel. Afdronk: iets kleverig, licht zoet, vanille en hazelnoten. Leuk bier!","BELGIUM","Hopverdju"
645,"2017-06-11",3.9,"Drank at VCBF 10-06-17. Has that typical sweetness of a milk sweet stout, with very nice peanut all the way through. Nice.","Nijmegen, NETHERLANDS","Maarten1993"

645,"2017-05-23",3.6,"Thick brown pour, tan head. Aroma is heavy with brown sugar and malts, but unfortunately there is a metallic quality to the nose as well. Flavor is mildly sweet with a medium body.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","weitz15"
645,"2017-04-14",3.8,"Black color with a tan head. Aroma contains some nuts, chocolate, vanilla, and a hint of coffee. Flavor is rather sweet with chocolate and vanilla dononating. Some bitterness in the finish. Overall too sweet to have many but tasty in small amounts.","Chattanooga, Tennessee, USA","Shag"
645,"2017-03-14",3.8,"Black pour with frothy tan head. Aroma is chocolate and roasty with a hinto candy vanilla. Flavor is large sweet chocolate/toffee, a toucho roasty, vanilla, coffee and a lite malt bitter. Medium full bodied and smooth. solid","decatur, Tennessee, USA","decaturstevo"
645,"2017-03-13",3.6,"Dessert beer, like a Reeses Cup with a layer of caramel between the peanut butter and chocolate. Pours ugly, reaching a suitable dark brown but offering little head and no lace. Aromas spot on: chocolate, vanilla and peanut butter. Taste is very, very sweet, milk chocolate and peanut butter with a vanilla-caramel backbone, roasted mocha notes playing around underneath but overshadowed by the candy bar leanings. Finishes sweet and slack, the texture a bit too weak for such a big sugary beer. Nice but a full pint seems a bit much to take.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"
645,"2017-01-24",4.0,"12 oz. bottled 12/16/2016. Black with a thin film of foam. Aroma is big with salty roasted peanuts and then mild notes of caramel and darkish chocolate. Flavor starts with the roasted peanuts and turns to a nice blend of peanut butter, caramel and a bit of milk chocolate. Finish has some vanilla and the long finish returns to the salty roasted peanut theme. Medium body is silky smooth with low-medium carbonation and a pretty good balance for a candy bar style brew.","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","nearbeer"
645,"2017-01-05",3.8,"Bottle. Pours black with a tan head that is barely there at all before it slips to a scum of foam.
The aroma is like sniffing the open end of the wrapper of a Reeses Cup.
Tastes like chocolate and peanut butter.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"
645,"2016-12-30",4.5,"Tap @ Mantra - Its a snickers bar in a beer, but its more delicate than that, the roasted peanuts are prominent, supported by sweet caramel and a vanilla finish. Fabulous!!","Virginia, USA","magsinva"
645,"2016-12-30",4.7,"Sampler from brewpub. Pours black with a khaki head. Leaves trace lacing in the glass. Smells like a candy bar. The vanilla, peanut, and the caramel all come through very nicely. Lovely balance between the milk stout base and the chocolate candy flavors. Finished clean. A fantastic beer. Deserves to be placed in the pantheon of milk stouts.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
