2021,"2017-03-30",3.7,"pint can courtesy of Buckeyeboy, cheers Jeremy !
Can # 546/750

brune, col épais crémeux café au lait.
Arôme est facilement noté sur leffet dérable - en sucre fermentescible? la vanille ajoute une pointe de douceur qui est assez dominante. Malt en rétro avec effet de crystal et pâle et qcq touches de chocolaté.
Palais est épais et donne de suite le ton avec ses 12%. petite touche résiduelle du sucre avec un effet de sirop dérable qui rajoute encore à cette effet de douceur tout en gardant le côté naturel de lérable.
Chocolaté noir assez plaisant avec un effet de poudre.
Petite amertume liée à ce chocolat arrive à percer avec en fin de bouche un autre ajout amer liée aux houblons - ces derniers sont dans une lignée américaine dagrumes. Les 12% sont clairement en avant et la vanille arrive en retrait - cette douceur est par ailleurs un peu de trop sur la fin surtout pour une cannette à boire seul. Retrouve une finalité des malts versant sur le chocolat, pâle et crystal.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

2021,"2017-03-25",4.0,"Im sure this will get reclassed to American Strong sooner or later at 12%.
Deep brown pour. Aroma and flavor are sweet. Some cocoa and vanilla up front, WAY less maple than good conduct showed. Despite that, still a very nice smooth big sipper.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
2021,"2017-03-19",3.5,"(Cannette provenant de la brasserie): Un ruisseau décadent de sirop dérable qui colle tout sur son passage. Cest également furieusement vanillé et la combinaison étourdi. Heureusement que les grains rôtis sont généreux, sinon le gâteau ne passerait pas dans la porte.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"

2021,"2017-02-18",4.1,"Draft at City Beer Store. The beer is dark brown with a small beige head. Some lacing. The aroma is overflowing with maple and vanilla. It smells like some sort of wonderful candy syrup thing. A touch of nuttiness and just a hint of cola. Tons of flavor. Quite sweet but it works for the beer and doesnt get cloying or anything. Lingering vanilla and maple - it just keeps going and going. Smooth, full mouthfeel. Coats the palate. Wonderful dessert beer.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

2021,"2017-01-10",3.8,"On tap at Beer Revolution. It pours a dark brown color with a khaki head. The aroma is extremely intense with dense chocolate, maple syrup and malted milkshake. Some strong vanilla notes too. The flavor is the same. Intense chocolate, vanilla, maple and nougat. Very sweet and a little smoky/roasted. The body is thick and lightly boozy. No off flavors, just a massive, sweet, boozy maple brown ale. A good sipper if you like this kind of beer.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
