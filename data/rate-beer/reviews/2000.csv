Having just recently tried their Hazelutely Choctabulous, I thought Id go back and re-review its 60% component, since the last time I tried it was more than three years ago, when frankly I didnt have the first clue what I was doing. And, not surprisingly, my score from back then was excessively high. Upon sober re-review, I conclude that this is slightly one-dimensional (all nut, all the time), slightly too sweet, and prone to a slight tendency to thinness in the finish. I can see how the addition of the Chocolate Stout (which I will be trying next) remediates those issues to make the Hazelutely Choctabulous as enjoyable as it is. (14/20)","CANADA","UXO"

Browar Rogue Ales z Newport w stanie Oregon specjalizuje się w warzeniu nowatorskich piw.
Piłem już kilka ich piw, wszystkie były wyborne, ale dopiero tym piwem skradli moje serce.
Śmiało mogę stwierdzić, że jest to jedno z najbardziej wyszukanych i nietuzinkowych piw jakie piłem.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, hazelnut and chocolate; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts.

This beer is rather intense, complex and balanced. Great flavour thanks to mixing hazelnuts with a Brown Ale. Feels like the base beer could have been more intense, but it is still fine for its abv. The aroma could have been stronger and the palate better though.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Aroma abounds with toasted malts; impressions of roasted pine nuts and chestnuts dominate, bark, autumn leaves, nutmeg, bitter honey, peanuts, burning wood, caramel, the kind of cocoa powder I used to make chocolate milk with as a child, biscuit, moccha, cardboard. Restrainedly sweetish onset, toasty, smooth and slick with rather thin body and lowish carbonation, nutty and slightly caramelly maltiness, somewhat resinous, peanut- and toasted bread-like till the very end, with some leafy hops adding a mild bitterness. Brown ales will never be my favorite style, but this is an enjoyable, straightforward example, with a pleasant sweet roasted nuttiness as its main theme, lasting for quite a long time after swallowing.

2000,"2015-01-18",3.7,"I keep telling myself that this is a brown ale and its really not going to be a viscous pour, so as dark as it is, Im not surprised when it flows out of the bottle at about the rate of an RC cola. (Dating myself?)
The liquid is a toasted honey-brown and light-bodied. It threatens to go over the top of the mug with a fat, delicate head that is so ambitious, I actually have to sip the foam down to a level that is compatible with a good photo. :-) Its gone in minutes, leaving only a thin stream of islands across the surface.
Head aside, the first drag demonstrates a fairly light-bodied beverage, nicely carbonated and tasting of slightly overdone chocolate chip cookies without the chips. A deep vanilla and toasted hazelnut make a play for my sweet tooth; silky warm malts seal the deal. Im hooked on this Rogue and am happily surprised by the tempting and creamy texture despite the lightness of the beer.

Instant full-wallop hazelnut concentrate in the nose, an immediate flashback to the 90s and its hazelnut-infused espresso shots with a generous helping brown sugar. Cherry Coke says Hi, wearing its glitzy shoulder pads. Taste is a supremacy of inferior Nutella spread and roasted hazelnuts ruining a palpably decent, if watery brown ale underneath, the delicate citrus zing of Saaz and Perle peeping gently from underneath the cheap nutty overload at the very end like the innocent glint in the eye of a shy first-time bukkake victim caught off guard in a cheap motel.

2000,"2014-06-12",3.2,"Transfer from BA review on 5-01-12- 
Poured from bottle into pint glass

Appearance  Pours a lighter brown color with a billowy tan head. The head has big carbonation bubbles entrapped within. These pop slowly overtime and leave a very nice level of lacing. 

Smell  Sweet aromas of brown sugar and molasses are quite strong. These are mixed with a malty breadlines and a hazelnut aroma. They all were in some ways not too complementary and instead seemed to be somewhat stale and artificial in nature.

Taste  A sweet brown sugar and roasted maltiness start the taste quite strong. These are soon meet with some of the hazelnut flavor and a sweeter molasses flavor that develop more toward the middle of the taste. The nuttiness intensifies as the taste advances more and is mixed with a lighter coffee flavor which dry the sweet flavor a bit at the end and leave a bitter sweet taste on the tongue which lingers a bit too long.

Mouthfeel Creamier then the average brew with a very medium level of carbonation. The creaminess suits the malty flavors well, but the carbonation sort of takes away from the flavors.

Overall  It was an alright brew. The flavors werent the greatest as some seemed a little bit artificial and the bitter and the sweet did not seem to meld very well.","","Darkmagus82"

Off-notes of wet cardboard & dry rot... What? Is this oxidized already? Hazelnut is more relevant on the palate... Hazelnut, cola, toffee, dry cocoa powder, & nuts, leading into a lasting woodsy & earthy finish. Im getting that weird, wet cardboard flavor & its really turning me off.

A: A fine dark brown color; Clear with a modest head. Head has only a short life.

It finishes with an extravagant roasted hazelnut and malt flavor, with hints of chocolate, oats, and spicy hops. Excellent bitter/sweet balance.

2000,"2014-02-15",4.3,"Reviewed from notes. Ive had this beer more than multiple times in my life.
The appearance is a dark brown colored body that leaves a nice one finger creamy tan lacing looking head. The body is totally too dark for any carbonation to be seen and a perfect super light foamy lacing is left.
The smell has hazelnuts and brown sugar up front with some malts in the background, reminds me a bit of beer bread.
The taste is the same as the smells coming through on my tongue with a bit more nuttiness.
On the palate, she sits about a medium, maybe closer to heavy, still has a good deal of sharpness on the tongue with a sticky aftertaste.

Translucent ruby brown colour; Very thin head and off-white foam which fades in 20 seconds; Small sticky lacing and notable slight carbonation; Aroma of chocolate, hazelnut, light roasted malt, nuts, molasses, light dark fruit and light cream; Mid to light sweet taste of light roasted malt, with light chocolate, cream, nuts, shades of dark fruits, light lemon and grass; Light body, watery palate; Taste profile is dominated by nutty, light roasted malt surrounded by light milk chocolate and hazelnuts. Some dark fruit taste shows up briefly, but otherwise pretty empty; Hoppiness is almost zero hop nose, adequate lime and grassy taste. Notable but fairly low bitterness for semi-finish; Wet after taste; Quite nutty and very easy to mouth.

Comments: This one is only half successful: it has the advertised hazelnut smell and taste, and a pretty nutty character. As a Brown Ale, though, its too watery, roasted malt is thin, too little cream and chocolate, and Perle / Sterling hoppiness is nowhere to be found. Feel like drinking a void. An ambitious Brown ended up with empty promises. Not again!","HONG KONG","GoufCustom"

2000,"2013-07-28",4.1,"A- Pours a partially hazy brown/coppery color and doesn't appear to have a whole ton of bubbly carbonation rising to the top. The head is somewhat disappointing though, as it is rather shallow to begin with and the tan colored foam disappears rather quickly into a skirmish of bubbly patchwork. The lacing is also not as good as I thought it would be, as some patchy clumps of head do cling to the side of my pint glass but slide right back into the brew. 

S- The aromas are quite nice, there being a noticeable rich malty scent with sweet cooked brown sugar mixed into the background. The hazelnut is there too, but it isn't the overpowering aroma that I thought there might be....just subtle essence! I also notice a slightly yeasty aroma the really helps smooth out any bitter notes that there are on the finish.

T- The flavors follow the aroma closely and very well! Again, rich caramel sweet malt is the dominant flavor with a hint of milk chocolate and toasted brown sugar. There is an Earthy nuttiness that compliments the sweetness overall on the palate and helps to add a mellow dryness to the beer. The finish is a blend of lingering hazelnut and bitter hops. Very nice indeed!

M- This has a very smooth character, with very creamy carbonation hitting the palate. This is a medium-full bodied beer and is probably one of the most well rounded beers a person will come across I believe! This really is a brown nectar and is like velvet desert on the palate!

D- Outside of the initial appearance, this beer has it all! It is full flavored and very well balanced with the hazelnut flavor at just the right amount, the alcohol is essentially non-existent, and is so sleek on the palate. I will most definitely purchase this again and highly recommend this beer! Rouge has put their spin on the brown ale style and more than hit a home run with this!

2000,"2013-07-27",3.4,"650ml bottle. Pours a clear deep copper, with a moderate off-white head, which lasts reasonably well but does not leave much lacing. Hazelnut, mild milk chocolate malt and light floral and fruity hops notes make up the aroma. Fruity, slightly spicy hops up front lead into a smooth praline-like blend of hazelnut and chocolate in the mid-palate. The hazelnut lasts into the finish, where it combines with more fruity hops. This is an interesting take on an English-style brown ale, and an enjoyable session ale.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","ComradeK"

Appearance: When I first cracked the bottle open, suds spewed everywhere as if I had popped champagne. Not a great first impression, but I quickly forgave it. I poured it in a glass and got a nice and creamy tan head, and a beer with a deep brown color. Nice.

Smell: Heavy malts, caramel, and obviously, hazelnut. Theres no hop presence in the smell or taste with this one, I can say that right now. Thats to be expected though.

Taste/feel: Its just what youd expect from a quality hazelnut flavored beer. It has a nice, deep, rich hazelnut and malt flavor. The aftertaste consists of coffee and maybe even some chocolate in the background. Pretty complex, and pretty damn delicious as well. The feel suits the beer well -- medium carbonation and feel, making this an easy drinking beer.

My taste buds liked Hazelnut Brown from Sam Adams, so I decided to try this one out, and I couldnt be happier with that choice ... suddenly one of my favorite beers.

2000,"2013-03-13",3.0,"Reviewed 2/20/13. 12 oz bottle into a nonic pint glass.

A: Pours a dark chestnut color. The head is a one finger light mocha shade featuring a good texture, but not much retention.

S: Strongly nutty - not just in terms of hazelnut, but other variants like almonds, walnuts, and pecans come through. Aromatically, its pretty much just peanut butter-esque with not much else to give any other depth. But that one note? Its extremely inviting and enjoyable.

T: Much sweeter than the aroma, and veering dangerously to artificial in terms of how it comes off. The flavor profile is hazelnut...and thats about it. Decidedly one note, and that solitary note has flaws to it. I dont hate it by any stretch, though.

M: The general texture is kind of thin and even insubstantial. Despite that, theres a lot of coarse finishing astringency that comes off slightly clashing with the sweetness and limp body. Hell, it even manages to be both watery AND sugary in its finish. Only thing it does right here is ease of drinkability.

O: Not particularly likable aside from the aroma; Im glad I only bought a single of these and wouldnt buy it again. Having said that, its a good choice for hazelnut lovers - because lets face it, the flavor is nothing BUT that. If this and Frangelic Mountain Brown have taught me anything, its that hazelnut beers give off great aromatic qualities...and not so great flavor profiles.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

2000,"2013-01-26",1.5,"Bottle for Ninas Edinburgh [260113]
Chestnut brown, clear, off white frothy head, good lacing
Aroma - Massive nut aroma with some sweet caramel malts underneath, its obviously a powerful essence added to the brew. OK initially then becomes unpleasant and awful
Taste - Smooth caramel malts with nut essence, dab of scorched  butter, powerful nut flavouring essence, has an artificial tinge. Get worse with the drinking - the underlying malty beer is pretty dull with the nut essence that gets more artificial. Gets undrinkable pretty quickly.
Palate - Soft carb, fairly thin for 6%. Finish is rapid, just left with a bit of that awful hazelnut linger.
Overall - Lots of people seem to love it. Well im in the minority that thinks its garbage. Another mans nectar is another ones poison. Only good point is the appearance in the glass. Straight down the sink.","Near Carrick-on-Shannon, IRELAND","stravale"

Head is fantastic, great lacing, deep reddish brown color.  To fit the Brown Ale style, in addition to being nutty and semi-sweet, its light-bodied without being watery - not weak at all.  Can either session or savor - exceptionally balanced.

Personally, I do not feel that the hazelnut flavor mates well with either a dry maltiness or the moderate-to-light hop bitterness which is present in this beer.

Dark brown cloudy pour with a light frothy head and minimal lacing. But hey who cares what it looks like, it's the taste that's all important and this beer delivers big time. The smooth malty caramel and nutty taste really hits you right in the face and there is a hint of coffee in the aftertaste too.

2000,"2012-04-24",3.7,"Bottle.  Porus an odd brown that at first seemed light and amber, then seemed reddish and now seems just kind of a muddy brown.  Head was pretty massive at first, but after a sip or two of sticking to my mustache seems to be behaving a little better and is nothing but lacing and a thin film of tan bubbles.  Aroma is definitely heavy with the nutty and earthy aromas.  I guess I would go so far as to say ""hazelnut,"" but it seems to be a little more of a generic nuttiness, with a decent amount of brown sugar sweetness peeking in on the party.  Flavor is a good mix of brown sugar sweetness, a little bit of grainy maltiness and that earthy and nutty edge.  Palate is a little odd... sometimes it seems full bodied and lovely, but then the next sip will seem a little thin and watery.  Its a common complaint of mine against Rogue, though, and Im wondering if it is the result of their house yeast strain or what.  Normally Im not a huge fan of brown ales, but this one is pretty decent.  Then again, maybe its just coz Im sitting here having a beer in the afternoon while Im not at work.

2000,"2012-02-22",4.1,"From notes.  First reviewed 3/14/2010.  Served on tap in a pint glass.

My pour of Rogue HazlelNut Brown has a deep, slightly cloudy burgundy color, with cherry changing to brown with the thickness of the glass. Soft off-white head lingers casually.

Strong, smooth, nutty aroma dominates the nose; roasted malt and vanilla also present.

There is a persistent, controlling hazelnut taste from start to finish. Caramel sweetness and a roasted malt flavor provide additional introductory stimulation, and some vanilla notes find their way into the flavor.

The very smooth taste is somewhat thrown off by the carbonation. It would be an improved with a creamier feel.

With a good level of complexity and balance, this is a great niche beer in the brown ale category. Definitely worth looking for on a regular basis.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"
2000,"2012-02-22",4.4,"A: A nice dark brown appearance. A thumbs width head first appeared that eventually dwindled down to small lacing on the surface.

S: Nutty, some toffee, some brown sugar.

T: A strong and bold hazelnut taste hits you upfront and stays with you throughout, but milds out as it goes along in a very positive way. The one complaint is that the flavor is definitely not organic, it comes from extract (think hazelnut drinks at Starbucks flavor), but until another beer produces a hazelnut brown ale with hazelnut beans I will always come back to this. The hazelnut definite dominates the flavor but hidden below is a brown sugary kind of undertone with just the slightest touch of some bitterness at the end.

P: A little too much carbonation, medium bodied.

O: One of my favorite beers and now that its offered in 6 packs make me a very happy person. It is a bit of a one dimensional beer, its definitely hazelnut-centric, but that one focus is done well and is of a flavor that I love.","","Denver2012"

Its the hops that makes this my favorite brown ale because it just helps balance out the malts; but its still a good malty beer overall.  This is also one of my favorite Rogue beers overall as well.  This would be good with cheese burger or a bbq pulled pork sandwich.","Dallas, Texas, USA","BeeRx"
2000,"2011-11-13",4.1,"Pours a brown-red with a nice thick head. Plenty of carbonation.  Smells of hops and malt. Slightly grassy as well. Plenty of roasted malt flavor, a moderate amount of sweetness that is like caramel and a touch of something darker like chocolate. Finish is similar but the hazelnut/nutty flavor lingers for a long time. Very balanced and mild. I think this beer would improve if they reduced the hops and let the nutty/toasty flavor ride through the finish.","San Francisco, California, USA","badhack"

Theres also something like a green hay flavor, perhaps hop derived, which is rather off putting.  Wonderfully weighted mouthfeel, perfect for the style, perfect carbonation.

There also is a hint of sweet grain. Full mouthfeel and carbonated. It leaves a tingle on your tongue in the finish which leaves your mouth watering for more.

2000,"2011-03-21",3.1,"651mL thanks to tastybeer. He brought it to share but we drank it without him. The pour is a hazy light brown/iced tea color with not much of a yellowish head. No retention. Aroma is heavy Frangelico and cranberry. Taste creates the illusion of something very rich within a thin, watery body: heavy hazelnut/Frangelico, cranberry, red velvet cake, but then there is lemon iced tea. Diacetyl actually comes through to create quite the thin yet buttery palate. I can see a lot of people loving this beer because it has a lot of flavor not seen in brown ales that blend nicely. But the base beer is your typical Rogue mediocrity. So interesting flavors? Yes. Brewing basics? No.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

A tremendous fragrance of a woody almond and walnut.  Traces of caramel add a touch of sweetness to the aroma.  This brew smells incredible.  I almost detect a brown sugar and hints of butter.  This is beautifully put together.  Full flavors of the roasted, toasted hazelnut and walnut.  Some suggestions of bitterness, but not intimidating.  Some slight warmth, but no real traces of alcohol.  Some touches of butter and caramel.  Properly balanced.  I even got some very faint chocolate.  Medium mouthfeel.  Smooth, slick and crisp.  Left proper amounts on the palate.  Not an over abundance, but nicely comfortable and mostly dry.  This is a pleasing and proper brown ale.  Wonderful aroma and flavor.  Very easy to drink.  It could be drunk year round.  The fragrance of this beer is the star of the show.  I kept sniffing it because it smelled so, so good.

2000,"2011-01-25",3.3,"Rogue HazelNut Brown Nectar (aka Bald Guy Brown) pours a hazy brown and develops a one finger foamy tan head. Retention was noticeably short and lacing was absent.

The aroma is dominated by hazelnut and general ""nutiness"". I pick up on a mild chocolate smell and a bit of brown sugar which is likely the sweetness from the malts coming through. It is not a very complex nose but it is well balanced.

The taste echoes the aroma and is also dominated by hazelnut with an understated chocolate flavor. The beer is very sweet (maybe too sweet for some tastes?). The taste is great but the sheer power of the hazelnut is distracting and makes isolating other flavors difficult. I found as the beer warmed slightly that the hazelnut became less overpowering. At this point the beer shined as more of a quality brown ale. 

The mouthfeel is creamy but with high carbonation. When holding the beer in the mouth longer to pick up on the flavors you get a pretty tingly tongue.

While it smells pretty good, theres something about it Im not really liking.  I think my nose is preparing me for a buttery taste.  Thankfully, there is no butter anywhere taste wise.  Cocoa, hazelnut, a strange faint taste of green beans, toasted bread.  Lots of toasty malt in the medium bitter finish.  Ive had this in the past, and I recall it having more flavour, but what Im drinking now is nothing to complain about.  I have been sitting on this bottle for a while though, so it could be its age coming through.  Decent stuff, and a fine effort.  (Let it breath/warm up.

S- Hazelnut overpowers the smell. Mild hints of caramel and chocolate malt hide in the background.

T- Flavor is much milder than the scent. Hazelnut is still upfront but smooth chocolate and caramel malts balance in the background. Finish is consistent with the initial flavor with everything becoming more subtle for the swallow.

P- Medium-low carbonation and medium weight body. Goes down like a nice English brown.

O- This is a nice offering from Rogue. A great twist on an English Brown Ale-the hazelnut character matches the mildness of the style to take it one step farther. One I will definitely have again.

Hazelnuts is what I smelled right from the start. Some caramel, brown sugar, a faint hint of dark fruit, and some floral notes in the background. Quite a mild aroma, even for a brown ale, but its pretty good still.

This beer has got a VERY pronounced hazelnut flavour, which is excellent and makes it stand out. Not very sweet, with some bitter-sweet chocolate and toffee notes. Very subtle dark fruit notes, and a touch of oatmeal (not sure why, but I could definitely taste it). Some bitter notes in the finish.

Medium-bodied. The carbonation was kind of crisp at first, but then it mellows down. Quite smooth, even creamy. No trace of alcohol (not surprisingly).

Aroma: Extremely enjoyable. Very nutty and sweet. The aroma is very basic. You know with out a doubt your in for a great beer.

Appearance: deep, rich brown. Clear and vivid. 

Flavor: This is it. This beer EXPLODES in the flavor department. Hazelnut is not an undertone. Hazelnut is the main act in this brew. Undertones include malt, coffee, toffee, maple, brown suger, pecan, walnut, and chocolate(almost like chocolate syrup). 

Palate: Very thin, but enjoyable. I would not want it any other way.

Overall Impression: This is my favorite beer. If I had the cash, this is all I would drink. I go thru about four large bottles a week. It is so damn tasty. Please!

2000,"2009-08-30",4.3,"Clear, bubbly brownish red appearance. Head fades quickly. More red than brown in the light.

A unique sugary sweet (but not at all cloying) brown aroma that is unlike any other brown Ive ever had. Its like cake and bready brown sugar with that dry hazelnut adding richness. Just tremendous; its a nutty, bready confection.

The taste is sweet, like real bready brown sugar. Grounded with sweet, bready yeast. Beautifully balanced between the sweet sugar and the nutty hazelnut. Hints of oatmeal and cocoa powder.

The feel is so dry and thick, like a light milkshake. Perfect consistency for this style. Its a great, sweet (but not saccharine) beer. Bready and confectionary. Wonderful and nutty.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"
2000,"2009-08-29",4.4,"22oz bottle. Pours dark amber brown with a beige head. Big hazelnut aroma. Flavor is dominated by caramel malt and hazelnut roast. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation.

2000,"2009-08-26",3.5,"Hmmm... I like Rogue... I like them a lot, but this is not their best effort, in my opinion. I am surprised by its 96 percent rating. Anyhow, it could look more enticing, small tan/brown head, nice colour though - pours a deep ruby red/light copper-brown. I could tell straight away that this beer was going to be lacking in body. The aroma is fair, woody, like damp forests, quite interesting, after that then theres yeast, light malts some chocolate. Flavour is OK, tastes a little false, not quite as pure as I was expecting, almost a little synthetic... lots of vanilla flavour, roasted malts but all in all its a bit thin and not massively complex. The palate is too carbonated. The basic problem with this beer is in its lack of body, it needs to be heavier and smoother. I cant taste the alcohol at all, but in this case Im not so sure thats a good thing, as what I taste more is wateriness... And the vanilla really has an additive quality to it which I dont appreciate, especially from a brewery of this quality. Not a total disappointment but I certainly expect more from these guys, and if this is your first Rogue beer then please dont judge them by this one, Ive had at least 5 or 6 of their beers previous to this and they have all been top notch. On the upside it is quite refreshing despite it being a brown ale. This is indeed a ""Rogue"" beer from the Rogue brewery.","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"
2000,"2009-08-26",2.7,"Served on tap into an imperial pint glass. Poured like a cheap cola, no head, highly carbonated, but overall watery. Nose was of that chalky trademark yeast, bleh.

Tasted like carbonated stool.","San Diego, California, USA","tokyogoat"

Nice to look at. Complex flavor with malty hints of hazelnut, nut, roast, choclate, cream, vanilla and oreo cookies. Heavily sweet but neither bitter not sour. Finish is sweet and short.

2000,"2009-08-20",2.8,"Serving: 22 oz. bottle.
Appearance: Deep amber brown with a large, foamy, tan head.  Decent head retention and lacing.
Aroma: Very nutty, a small metallic note, wood, a touch of soy, and of course hazelnuts.
Taste: More nuts, but completely lacking body.  A little cardboard and a slight tart note.  A little oxidized perhaps.  Not so good on the tongue.
Palate: Medium, smooth carbonation with a medium-light mouthfeel, watery mouthfeel.  Medium-short, nutty finish.
Overall: Lacks depth and flavor.  I am taking this with a grain of salt because I think this bottle may be a little oxidized.
Rebuy: Perhaps to test the oxidation theory, but otherwise no.","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"

Flavor is roast, toasted hazelnut, caramel, overdone toffee, chocolate liquer, a little grass and just a hint of tartness toward the finish. Palate is medium bodied, somewhere between creamy and syrupy texture and a neutral entry with a dry finish.

The use of hazelnut is quite excellent.  Hazelnuts can sometimes make things a little too sweet, but this isnt over hazelnutted.  A roasted aroma and roasted flavor (no doubt thanks to the Crystal malt/hazelnut combo) gives this an undertone of coffee.  Tasty!","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

Aroma was quite discrete, giving away not much of anything, at least to my untalented nose.  Taste was quite different, being that of a ""good brown ale"".  The mouthfeel was smooth, and there at the end, the hazlenuttiness(?) appeared.  Surely a grand aftertaste.  Certainly worth another visit.","Delta, British Columbia, CANADA","MrRoss"

Very tasty beer; coffee, milk chocolate with some very rich tasting malts makes this beer a pleasure to drink. I can even taste the hazel nut its not just a marketing gimmick, the beer leaves a nice bitter after taste. I also enjoy the fact the taste isnt to overpowering like some of the other Rogue brews.

2000,"2009-03-23",3.6,"Pours a red brown with a very thin film of a head and a slight yeast cloud to the beer.  Aroma is composed of a light chocolate malt scent with the rest of it being very nutty of Hazel nut.  Flavor is dominated by the nutty hazel nut flavor but there also resides a light, semi-watery flavor of chocolate malt and some Munich maltiness in the back.  The beer has a moderate carbonation and has very smooth flavors.Overall the beer is dominated by the nutty flavor but it remains very palatable and a very good semi-sweet, cookiesh beer.","Crystal Lake, Illinois, USA","Narnad"

2000,"2009-02-09",4.0,"A- Pours a nice dark brown with creamy light brown head that is small and mostly lasting, fair lacing that does not stick to the glass
S- Warm, delicious nose that is dominated by roasty and toasty malts, hazelnut tones (of course), as well as a hint of toffee and vanilla; truly an amazing and fun aroma that I feel exceeds most other brown ales
T- Not a disappointment as hazelnut maltiness is pervasive throughout, some mild bitterness intially that is followed by sweet chocolate, toffee, and coffee; duration is short and malty; no noticeable alcohol taste
M- Surprisingly underwhelming mouthfeel that is quite watery and light for this genre, soft carbonation; the gap in quality between taste and mouthfeel is surprising

2000,"2009-01-09",3.4,"UPDATED: SEP 19, 2010 In short: An intensely hazelnut flavoured brown ale.  Straight to the point.
How: Bottle 22oz, consumed fresh soon after purchase.
The look: Cloudy brown body topped by a medium beige head
In long: Nose of hazelnuts and milk chocolate.  Taste is more of the same.  The beer feels very creamy despite the very active carbonation.  Hazelnuts, milk chocolate, more hazelnuts, a touch of vanilla, more hazelnuts, some butter (peanut butter).  The beer sure aint complex but it is like nothing else.  A really fun beer but I wouldnt drink that all night long.  Lets just say that the first half of the bottle is a lot more fun than the second half.  A bit too sweet and that creamy/buttery sensation is a bit too much for a session beer.  As sweet and nutty as my aunt Alice.

I could sniff this all night and be content. Flavour is really big on the nutty aspects, with a touch of vanilla being a strong tag along to the whole party. Less barley flavour than I was hoping for after the aroma, but still some decent malts in there. Minor milk chocolate, as well as maybe some rye bread. Really not much hops to speak of, and usually Im very perceptive of Saaz.

2000,"2008-08-06",4.4,"For the Rogue in all of us.

Sounds like the story of my life, past, present, and future. Rogue always delivers an excellent brew, and the Hazelnut Brown Nectar is no exception. Available in a 22oz bomber, she quickly fills my glass to her very tip-top, but without overflowing.

Rich, dark brown with hints of amber showing through along the sides of the glass. A thick soft creamy head at least 2 fingers thick quickly forms, and then fades into a lush layer of creamy foam resting on top of the beer. Rich hazelnuts practically overflow from the glass and throughout the nose. Sweet malty caramel notes act as an accent to the intensely sweet roasted hazelnut aroma and palate. For such a succulently aromatic brew, the body and mouthfeel are very balanced. Neither too heavy nor too cloying. An excellent brown ale. The hazelnuts practically dance across my taste buds, sweet and nutty on the first number, then settling into a more mellow malty profile with a hint of hop bitterness in the finish. As she warms, along with the sweet roasted hazelnuts I detect a hint of oats/grain in the nose and the palate, mingling with the hazelnuts to bring an almost ""breakfast"" taste and aroma to the brew. I would attribute this to the oats aroma I detect. Even so, Hazelnut still goes down smooth and easy, leaving even less of a hop nip at the finish the further along in my glass I go. Fabulous.

Probably one of my favorite American brown ales, Rogue pulls off a stellar traditional and yet revolutionary interpretation of the English Brown Ale style. Easy to quaff, Ive had Rogue Hazelnut Brown Nectar both on draft and in the bottle and I can say that both stand proud.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

The taste is different than the smell lets on. Sweet, as was expected, but there is a strong nutty taste that hits from the second the brew touches your lips. It finishes very smooth and slightly bitter leaving hints of hazelnut taste on the pallet. It is carbonated fairly highly and I personally think this takes away from the mouthfeel. I would have enjoyed this style more with less carbonation but regardless, it was thick and smooth.

2000,"2008-03-18",3.8,"UPDATED: SEP 16, 2008 On tap at Plan B, W Hartford CT. Absolutely zero head on this one by the time it got to me, but I’m not much of a stickler for the appearance category unless it looks like piss. Aroma started off sort of juicy, grape-ish. A little later it reminded distinctly of strawberry-rhubarb pie, fruits and delectable, buttery crust included. This doughy, buttery pie-crustiness continued throughout the flavor with the fruits/general malty sweetness sort of switching off from time to time. I honestly don’t think I would be able to identify hazelnut if given a blind sampling of it, so maybe that turned into this pie crust I keep talking about. In any event, I thought this was very unique, and very nice if you’re in the mood for some smooth sweetness.8-4-8-4-16/4.0Rerate 9/16/08. Interesting. Was I served the wrong beer the first time? Was it just way too cold as all tap beers from that location are? Was I just an idiot? Hard to say, but my goodness, there are hazelnuts here, fresh, nature-filled, fleshy hazelnuts comprise the majority of the aroma. I could make arguments for some earth and a touch of spice, but really it’s all from the nuts. Flavor not quite as nutty, but a general nuttiness still plays a prominent role with some chocolatey notes and semi-roasted sweet malt coming through more. Finish actually goes back to that huge hazelnut though, right back where you started. Very tasty and uniquely nutty in my experience.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

Smell: Very nutty, nice hazelnut aroma with a little bit of caramel and chocolate.

Taste: Not sweet, not bitter.  What I got was a very mellow, creamy, nutty flavor, not strong at all. It reminds me of a hazelnut coffee with way too much cream so that a lot of the intense flavor is gone. Minuscule hop presence. Aftertaste is nutty then roasted coffee.
Flavor is good but if it packed the appeal of the smell it would be great.

Head is fizzy and off white and gone way too quick with no lacing. Color is brown (maybe thats where they got the name brown ale). Flavor starts lightly sweet and acidic then finishes lightly acidic and bitter. Palate is light to medium watery and a carbonation thats between lively and fizzy.

Flavor delivers exactly what I hoped!  Great carbonation and smooth mouthfeel, good sweet malt and hop that reminds me of Christmas in Germany... (It seems hazelnut is in everything christmas and not too much sweetness).  Really hits the nuttiness on the head.  Has a certain buttery creaminess that is very reminiscent of eating nuts and how the fat from the nuts coats ones palate.

2000,"2007-07-20",3.7,"Draft at the Downtown Broadway Brewhouse. Pours opaque brown with a small beige head. Aroma of hazelnut, malt, and cookie dough. Medium bodied with a light but subtle earthy texture. Initial flavor of vanilla, and hazelnut that transitions to more of a creme  and chocolate middle, with a hint of nuts. Not overly sweet, but enough to accent the flavors. Mild amount of bitterness  to bring it into balance on the finish. Nice beer.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","illinismitty"

2000,"2007-07-16",2.9,"I really had high hopes for this beer as it scored so highly in everything I have read about it.  Unfortunately this was a huge disappointment. 

When I saw it looked like root beer in the glass I should have stopped there.  The nose is nutty with a strong malt component.  Feels thin and over carbonated in the mouth.  The flavor coats your tongue in nuttiness and finishes strongly with a *blech* factor.

I will admit that I am a hop-head, and I was hard-pressed to find anything nice to say about this beer.  This one is definitely NOT for the hop lover.","Wyoming, Michigan, USA","Myfathersson"

Hazelnut is promenent (no surprise) but there were an array of lightly toasted malts, chocolate, almond, even peanut butter.  The flavor features hazelnut up front, but evolves toasted almond, chocolate flavors and finishes with a dry twinge which has echoes of mocha coffe and smoke.

Taste: Its delish! Malty sweet, with flavors of hazlenut, vanilla, and even coffee. The soft, floral hops are delicate and help to balance out the sweetness, though they remain light (and especially light for Rogue). Lastly, both chocolate and honey close out things. Finish is clean.

2000,"2007-05-06",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 25, 2008 Re-rate: After seeing this beer sit in my top 10 for over a year, I felt compelled to re-rate it. Given that my original score came during my first few weeks of rating, I felt fairly confident (after 800 other beers) that my original rating wouldnt hold up. I was right... It pours a clear mahogany with a creamy head which reduces to a thin cap. The nose is a roasted, slightly musty malty hazelnut. Light-bodied and creamy with a toasty finish. Sweet, toasted malt, hazelnut and toffee. This is not the amazing brew that I remember experiencing, but it is still a damned fine brown.
Original Rating from 5/6/07: Pours a dark murky brown with a medium, frothy, tan head. Aroma is of hazelnuts, toffee and raisins. It has a creamy, medium bodied and lively palate very satisfying. The taste is out of this world. Its like a warm hazelnut blanket for your tongue ending in a light hoppy finish. Lingering aftertaste is all malt. Im fairly confident that this isnt typical of the average brown ale, but if youre a fan of hazelnuts, who cares. This is, by far, one of my favorite beers. 7/4/10/5/19","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"

2000,"2007-04-28",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 10, 2007 Pours chocolate brown with a tan medium-sized head that lasts, leaving some crusty lace. Aroma is delicious dark fruit cake, brown sugar and slight chocolate. Oh man, the flavor is the same (but not too sweet) and balanced with some just-right bittering hop on the end. Great brown-sugary nasal aftertaste like a Rochefort 10 or Chimay Blue, but the slight sugar on the tongue is balanced out well and even ends on a dry and slight sour note. Palate is medium, dry and tingly.  I dont know (or care) if this really fits the ""style"", but it is unlike any brown I have had, and is more similar to some strong Belgians.

2000,"2007-04-14",3.8,"UPDATED: JUN 14, 2012 From a 22 oz bottle poured a deep and very clear red with a tan head that left almost no lacing.  Rich nose of hazelnuts, and malts. Some whiffs of fruit.  Mouthfeel is a a bit cloying.  Flavors are fairly complex, and after you get past the hazelnuts, which tends to dominate, you can detect chocolate, coffee, fruits, molasses, and the tiniest bit of hops.  Finish is a bit sweet.  Not your ordinary brown, and hard to rate in the category, but without concern for its type, it is an interesting brew, particularly if you like hazelnuts.

This is a re-rate after having this on Draft at the Local Beer Bar in Eureka, CA.  There is nothing like fresh draft to move a beer to the head of the class.

This aroma really doesnt com out until you let the beer a warm a bit. After that, you can smell nuts. The color is a dark brown, that looks really nice, and serves a Hazelnut beer right. I could taste the nutty flavor. It opens up in your mouth like crazy. This was the same experience I had with the chocolate stout. The flavor is impressive. I wouldnt say it is too sweet. I mean come on were talking about Hazelnut Ale here. The palate did not impress me. Rogue has the opportunity to make better beers that are full of flavor, yet I am constantly disappointed by the thin consistency of their beers. I must say though that Rogue often impresses me with their willingness to experiment with new flavors.

Rogues Hazelnut Nectar poured really attractive looking dark brown. Clear with rusty highlights when held to the light. Two finger creamy tan head. Light carbonation coming up from spots all over the glass.

Smells of dough, sweet malts and a touch of hazelnut. The more I take in the more I get chocolate and some vanilla even. Smells Good. Almost like a dessert. 

The taste really stands out. Theres a wonderful doughy quality followed by the hazelnut. There is an incredible smoothness with this beer. Really tastes good.

The mouthfeel, in my opinion, is perfect. Its a nice medium body. A little chewy and super smooth. Its like velvet in my mouth.

Drinkability is way up there on this one too. It would be extremely easy to sit back and enjoy a few of these with no problem at all.

Hazelnut Nectar is The best brown ale Ive ever had. Another great tasting exciting beer from Rogue.

The aroma seemed somewhat subdued, with slight nuttiness in the nose.  But the taste!  After letting it sit on my tongue for a second or two, I was hit with an enormous sweet hazelnut flavor; it was unreal.  Definitely the strongest flavor Ive experienced in a beer.  After the initial hazelnut punch, some coffee made an appearance on the back of my tongue.  The finish was smooth and malty.  Though Rogue suggests serving this beer with pork or beef, I must disagree.  I think this beer is too sweet to mesh well with dinner.  Id personally prefer it with dessert.

2000,"2006-11-14",3.4,"Pours a dark brown with red tendencies; head is fairly small and off-white with little lasting ability.  Fruitiness in the nose is noticible right away, with notes of hazlenut (obviously), toffee, choclate, and some dates and fig, as if from a Belgian dark.  Flavor is not quite the same, but chocloate dominates with toffee, hazlenut, date, and an earthy, root flavor; bitterness is low.  Palate is medium with moderate carbonation and a watery, slick feel.  Finishes earthy and chocolatey with dryness.  One of a kind brown ale with some intiguing qualities, especially the nose, nut the finish and lack of balance really kills it for me.  Plenty of charcter and better than most browns.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","talon1117"

2000,"2006-06-11",3.5,"Rogue is an interesting brewery, one that from my standpoint has always lurked in the shadow of brewers like Stone. For the first time, myself and my drinking partner GarrettB decided to tackle this uncharted territory, starting with the Brown Ale. The pour produced a dusty cola brown body that foams up and quickly reduces to a simple beige cap. Wonderful scents of my childhood are subtly laced together, sweet aromas of Nutella and nougat de Montélimar meld into a caramel cappuccino explosion. The combination is truly enticing and nostalgic to my nose. The flavor, however, is a bit disappointing: the caustic sensation of burnt toast dominates initially and merges with thin notes of caramel, honey, coffee and implied chocolate. The rich fragrances resign to a lucid, two-dimensional palate that lacks the depth it requires to support such substantial flavors. With an unimpressive watery and slightly bitter aftertaste, this brew seems to progresses to an increasingly unfinished state. Not far from a winner, but this Brown Ale requires just a bit more work for my taste.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

The nose is delicate (my allergy ridden sinuses couldnt pick anything up at first, though after blowing my nose...).  Milk chocolate, almost Nutella, given that distinct sweet hazelnut overtone.  Just a touch of flowers at the end, though given the big malt, I suppose some more hops wouldve been nice for balance... though I dont think that would be appropriate for a beer that smells like desert.  Though this is a great tasting beer, I was immediately wowed by the palate--silky smooth with the tiniest bubbles Ive ever encountered.  Just enough viscosity to remain a session ale.  This really nails the right mouthfeel for a brown, in my humble opinion.  This brew really continues to shine in the flavor department.  Huge malt, chocolatey and creamy sweet with just a hint of spicey hops at the end.  The finish is a bit toasty for a brown, but I cant say Im complaining!  The hazelnut isnt as obvious in the flavor, but it sneaks out in the lactic aftertaste.  This is one of the nicest session beers Ive consumed.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"

The nose on this beer is excellent with lots of fragrant hazelnut aroma, paired with nutty and sweet malt aroma. The palate is firm, with good sweet malt, and nutty malt flavors. This beer finishes, with more good sweet and nutty malt flavor up front, then ends sligjhtly cloying, with a very pleasing hazelnut flavor that lingers.

The aroma had a decided aroma of hazelnut, grassy hops and roasted malts. This one had a medium body with lively carbonation and a slightly thin texture although there was an alcohol warmth in the finish.

You think its gonna be sweet from the aroma and front end flavors but to my amazement it stays totally dry. This is a very interesting brew. The color is a rich brown with a splash of red creating a slightly tawnied blood hue. Pours a chocolate milk colored froth that hangs around for a while.

Could use a few bubbles to liven up the appearance but otherwise beautiful. Aroma is absolutely gorgeous: honey, hazelnut, toast, some coffee, butter note, background of raisins. Sweet. A feast for the nose! The flavor is comparatively indistinct.. I get coffee and a lot of toast with some assertive hop bitterness and muddled other flavors. Light alcohol (not unpleasant). Im not tasting any hazelnut. Doesnt feel like much in the mouth, thin and watery with no carbonation to speak of.. could definitely use more body, but quite drinkable at least. Id get this again just for the nose, though!","Berkeley, California, USA","ghorsche"

Prominent, flavorful nuttiness and roasted flavor with praline/pecan dominating. Hop bitterness is present yet gentle, not coming off as ""rancid"" as I have detected in other nut browns. Mildly syrupy body with an efferevescent tingle to enliven the flavors. Although on the lighter side, this is a nice ""dessert"" beer.

2000,"2006-03-18",3.9,"Tap.  Dark amber-mahogany in color with some cherry accents when put to candlelight.  A dime-sized bubbling grey sheaf is all the head that weve got.  Whole wheat bread and maple brown sugar sweetly waft up the nose, along with almond butter, sweet caramel ribbons and Honey Bunches of Oats with excessive maple syrup.  Sweet, nutty concoction that thrives on maple syrup out of oak vats begins the flavor regime.  Gentle, sweet slide that (rather than falling apart in the aftermath) thickens to impart a woodsy, tree bark and sweet honey roasted pecan characteristic.  Controlled carbonation breaks way for cocoa nut butter - Nutella style - likely a byproduct of the principle hazelnut contention.  Cookie crisp cereal and chocolate Honey Maid graham crackers reiterate a sweet, smooth spurge, and maple nut fudge prevails in its afterlife.  Possibly the best nut brown Ive ever had.","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

The aroma has that, but no overt coffee aroma. Flavor is mysteriously devoid of chocolate, but the coffee comes back, again not in the bitter form Im used to it from most stouts and porters. Hazelnut is right, along with some cream, nutmeg, natural sugar...somehow not-too-sweet caramel and toffee malts. The feel is only rivaled by the best made oatmeal porters and stouts.

Mine smelled not too great, a bit sour, perhaps it was old.  Flavour on the other hand was wonderful!  Nutty, chocolatey without straying too far from tasting ike beer, or becoming one or two dimensional.

2000,"2005-12-10",3.9,"(22 oz bottle: $4.29 at Hi-Time Wine Cellars in Costa Mesa, CA) Brown ales arent the most exciting of beers, but if youre gonna brew one, and youre the brewer for Rogue, you throw down the gauntlet and brew a kick ass brown.  This is an absolutely delicious nut brown ale with a very potent and sweet caramel flavor that tastes just like candy caramels.  And damn, it smells like caramel candies too!  Plenty of hazelnut , chocolate and honey in the flavor, and bitterness is very mild from start to finish.  Medium bodied, moderately carbonated, but it becomes a bit cloying now that Im polishing off the second half of this bomber.  Dark ruddy brown in color, clear in appearance, but too dark to see through.  Unfortunately, the dark tan head is bubbly and fizzy, so though it starts off at nearly an inch, it dissipates fairly rapidly down to a ring.  Yeah sure, it might be too sweet for some people, and it does seem pretty sugary sweet to me, but its just so damn tasty!  Easily my favorite brown ale.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Poured brown that when held up to the light amberish color shined through. Light brown head that didnt last to long. Aroma was of faint chocolate and fruits.

Smell was amazing, beery, but with a hazelnut ice cream smell. The taste is odd. Im not sure hazelnut matches the taste of hops very well. Definite caramel maltiness, not too sweet, and full mouthfeel with a hint of pleasant graininess. A bit of chocolate taste complements the filbert flavour, but the dessert taste wars with the spicy saaz hops, IMO.

The nose packs plenty of sweet, though roasty, hazelnut scents. Hazelnut is right up front in the flavor, but its adequately smoky to keep things from being annoyingly fake. Soy sauce, chocolate, and nuts make up the flavor basically. Its a shade too sweet to be completely exquisite, but when Im in the mood for a sweet beer, this does the trick. Again, plenty of smoky, semi-meaty flavors are present to keep this from being one dimensional or cloying. Its a nice beer.

Bomber at Pisa Pizza. Its been a while since Ive had this one. The nutty quality is more out of hand than I remember. Pure flavors of nuts are all over the place on this one. Its not bad, it actually imparts a nice roasty, chewy quality to the entire brew. Sometimes this walks the line of being too sweet, but its not bad. I often think of brown ales as having a nutty quality, this one takes it to the next level.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

And speaking of flavors. Rich toffee flavor with some good understated hop bitterness. Initially sweet, but with a dry, clean finish that keeps it from feeling sticky in the mouth. A very smooth, well-rounded beer.","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"

Strong hazelnut/chocolate/caramel flavour that goes down beautifully smooth and leaves a tart feeling on the sides of the tongue.

Taste is much like the smell. Roasted malt followed by overpowering taste of the hazelnut extract. Lightly sweet and lightly smoky. A surprising bitter hoppy finish with a lightly malty aftertaste on the tongue, then you are tasting the hazelnut again. Hints of nutty vanilla or almond too. For me, the strong hazelnut prevent it from being really drinkable but it is still very smooth. A complex and tasty brew.

I let the glass warm a little while reading some of the reviews here and I think that was wise.  This is bursting with goodness from a style that I usually find quite drab.  There is also malt and some roasted flavor and even some vanilla.  I think it is very balanced and while it isnt too thick it feels good in the mouth almost buttery.

Honey, maple and light caramel round out the flavor, with a finish of maple-cream butter and more chocolate malts.  Little hops apparency, just some earthiness.

2000,"2004-12-20",4.3,"Draft at the Rogue Public House in Portland.  First off, the color is stunning: a cloudy red-amber (almost cider-colored) with a nice beige-ish head.  The flavor is truly like nectar, starting malty-sweet and rounding out into a symphony of spice, nuttiness, some fruit and something else I couldnt quite figure out.  The palate isnt distinct, but is pleasant and delicious as it lingers.  One of my new favorite beers.","Portland, Oregon, USA","RogerBurks"

I was afraid of a very chemical nutty taste, and was very happy to discover that wasnt the case.

2000,"2004-11-26",2.4,"May, 2003: Big pint bottle. Newcastle Brown with some hazlenut syrup. Pleasant enough, but not a great beer. These Rogues have a reputation for being great beers - so far they have merely been acceptable. Im surprised that so many people I respect are giving this such praise. Obviously Im missing something. OK - attractive hazlenut colour, check. Slight raison and hazlenut aroma, check. Mouthfeel - light medium with small carbonation, check. Nothing special so far. Flavour dominated by a sort of hazlenut syrup with touches of vanilla and caramel, behind which - and not exactly well integrated - is a sort of nutty, rusty beer with some traces of hop bitterness that warms in the finish, but is marred by a metallic quality and a chemical hazlenut. Some chocolate late in the finish. A clumsy journey full of faults. Try as I might, I cant see this as even a good beer.","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"

I have a feeling that this will be a great one.  Cloudy and brown, with almost streaks going through it.  Nose of sweet toffee, vanilla - lots of vanilla and I guess some hazelnut as well.  Taste is like no other beer Ive ever had... nutty, honey, vanilla, semi sweet and great creamy fully body with a very light if any hop addition.  Being a hop-head, I am surprised at how much I love this brew.  It is simply a great beer.  I cant wait for another.","Sligo","pjk33"

Mouthfeel is on the thin side, but silky as well - a beautiful blend of maltiness and nutty flavour.  Not much hop presence until the end.  And then after that, you really get the hazelnut after youve put your glass down and contemplated.  I really enjoyed this brown ale - a little more body and it would be perfect for the style.

Had this at the Rogue pub in San Franciso in November 05 and loved it even more - it seemed to have much more body and was bursting with flavour - easily the best brown ale I have ever had and even better than the 4.1 bottle I originally rated.

It poured a thick, earthy brown with a short-lived head, emitting luscious scents of hazelnut, caramel, and vanilla.  The taste was a cascade of malty richness combining nuttiness, sweetness, and a buttery-smooth texture.  Not much in the way of hops, but the sensational flavors left nothing to be desired.

There are buttery hints, chocolate malt hints, hazelnut syrup in some sips.  Although this was creamy thoughout (but not thick), the only complaint is with the complexity seeming to come with bad blending and disparate sips.

The aroma was bursting with hazelnut and chocolatey malt. What a stimulation to my nose. 

The taste was definitely pleasurable to say the least! Its like drinking hazelnut pureed with dark chocolate. Carbonation was very light, which adds to the taste. I have a problem deciding which beer I like better, this or the chocolate stout. :-)

Taste is mildly roasty malt, coffee for sure...hazelnut coffee.  Some ripe fruit in the taste, but that's also very subtle.  Do I taste raw cookie dough and Bailey's?  This beer may be more complex than I can handle rating.  Wonderful!!  The finish is dry with only a slight back-of-the-tongue bitter.  Actually, the finish reminds me of room temperature coffee, too.  Great beer.  So much better than other brown ales I've had like Moose Drool and Newcastle (opposite ends of the brown ale spectrum).

Practically opaque red-brown color, quickly dissipating tan head.  Woody, grassy aroma.  Malty start, some of the hops in the middle, with the hazelnut flavor riding out the finish.  Sticky sweet residuals.  This beer is nicely smooth to drink, but it seems a bit one-dimensional, really only featuring the hazelnut extract.  I think I liked the aroma more than the flavor, actually.

Initial flavor is stunning. Deep, rich nuttiness plus a huge, complex malt character. Mild organic honey and molasses sweetness that builds and becomes a burnt sugar flavor after awhile. Aftertaste includes some delicate hop spice. This beer left me with a mixed impression, probably because I'm just not a big fan of Brown Ales. The artfulness of this beer is impressive but it left me with a mouth-coating staleness that I find in some Browns.

Taste is rockin' smooth of chocolate tones and hazelnuts, slightly roasty and a touch of quick sweetness. Nice airy nut-like dryness in the finish. Nice creamy medium body, way smooth, quite nice and easy, makes for excellent drinkin'. The only thing is that its over to fast, but man its good! Another top notcher by Rogue.
Morimoto version-
I couldn't tell much difference between this and the other hazelnut brew Rogue makes except it seems to have more extractness to it. Nice solid dark brown color with some dark orangey glowing edges, thin but firm creamy dark ivory head, faded off slowly, lace in small spots. Smell is light roasty chocolate and a big time hazelnut extractness to it, some wiffs have more hazelnut then others where others were nearly empty. Taste is about as smooth as the other hazelnut beer with some lightly favorable chocolate tones and hazelnuts, slightly roasty and a touch of quick sweetness. Nice airy nut-like dryness in the finish, yet stays sweet. Perhaps a bit too much in that regards. Again with some sips the extract is more evident then others. Seemingly off a bit comparingly to the original. Still, a nice creamy medium body encompasses it while it maintains an overall smoothness and drinkability.

2000,"2003-07-07",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 24, 2005 Dark brown body with a diminishing head.  Nutty malt aroma, light hops (herbs?), and moderate yeastiness (dough).  Sweetness throughout with a moderately bitter finish.  Oily to creamy mouthfeel and lively carbonation.  A little unbalanced to the sweet side.  Peppery saaz hops are detectable and do a good job of keeping the hazelnut sweetness under control.

Rerate 8/14/03.  Better than I originally gave it credit for (4.1).  Starting a little warmer (50 degrees F)than Im sure I had it last time, I noticed just how svelt this brew is.  Smooth, nutty, lightly tingling carbonation (maybe a little too much so), a good creamy mouthfeel, delicious chocolate malt, nice spicey Saaz kick without being overly hoppy.  The list goes on and on.  Using Saaz and Perle hops in this brew was absolutely genious, IMHO.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

It pisses me off that Rogue bottles the same beers under different names.  Morimoto had nothing to do with this beer whatsoever, unless he's been working at Rogue since they came out with the Hazelnut Brown Nectar.  Anyways, this is not as good as I remember.  Still has a good sweet hazelnut flavor, but their isn't much malty complexity.
Still a good, easy-drinking beer, so I'll let the mislabeling slide for this time.

Original Rating:
Robust sweet malty nose and medium to dark brown color.  Tastes like freshly cracked crystal malt stewing at mashing tempurature.

2000,"2003-01-30",3.1,"Well, I did my homework and this was the highest rated beer at Hopyard last nite. I did the cask IPA first (gotta do decent cask first, it's a religious thing) and then moved on to the big gun. I guess I'm not a hazelnut bear guy. This was the highest rating I could come up with and I hope it's at the end of a happy keg and tailing off or something because I was just NOT impressed. Yes, it's got good head and color and yes the feel is good, not great. But it tasted like someone had made a hazelnut beer by adding some commercial hazelnut extract like you do with coffee and it overbalanced the rest of the flavors in my (our) opinion. Had it been a bit more subtle and interacted in a more complex way with the malts, it would have been a different story but I couldn't pull the malts out in the mouth or the finish.

OK, I usually avoid reviewing beers that I've not tasted for five years, so I'll keep it short.
According to the members of ratebeer.com, this is the best brown ale in the world.
This accolade is no fluke.  It's easy to make a cloyingly sweet brown ale.
Rogue has managed to perfectly balance malt sweetness with just enough hop bitterness.
They also managed to squeeze a mind-boggling amount of complexity into a notoriously delicate (read: easy to screw up) beer style.

Pours out of the 22 oz bottle a very dark brown color with a great ruby red tinge. Head is a little small and dissipates quickly. Aroma has distinct brown sugar tones and a touch of hazelnut, and maybe a maple syrupy note in there too. Flavor is smooth all the way through. A bit of maltyness, no bitterness at all. Definitely sweet flavor, but just the right amount (not overly sweet or syrupy). Overall very delicious. I like brown ales, and this is the piece de resistance.","Salt Lake City, Utah, USA","JasonG"

There's a lot of good stuff here - buttery sweet hazelnut taste right up front; one reviewer compared this experience to imagining a bowl of toffee ice cream right in front of him, and I tend to agree.  Taste reminds me of a toasted caramel and it doesn't disappoint as the temperature rises - although I didn't give it much of a chance to rise as I guzzled it down.

You know how if you eat regular chocolate then have some dark chocolate, you notice the profound difference in the richness of the two.  Well, thats how this beer compares to just about every other beer Ive had.  I was imagining a bowl of toffee ice cream in front of me when I had this, and it made me wonder why bars dont serve ice cream.  In this case it seems like it would be a perfect match.  The aroma and taste are reminiscent of hazelnuts but also toffee, caramel, and Kahlua.  The body was medium and just about where it should have been for all the sweetness.

Certainly nutty, although I wasnt sure it was hazlenut as I know it, but rather something else...a bit of pistachio almost?  A certain unsatisfying substructure, a bit thin yet a bit fizzy.

The hops are surprisingly apparent (considering the IBU is only 33) and the malt is nice and mellow. The really cool thing about this beer though is the hazelnut extract. At first I was wondering where it was, but as the beer neared room temp it became increasingly apparent.

2000,"2002-06-08",4.8,"Perfection on draft. I would not make this my everyday brown ale -- thats Newcastle -- because I want the act of drinking it to retain a special aura. They are not kidding when they call Rogue Hazelnut a nectar (of the gods, as the rest of the phrase goes). 6/7/2002 update: Slightly less of a knock-out bottled (although still very impressive). Im taking the Overall Impression down a couple of notches because of that. But what beer isnt better on draft?","Green Bay, Wisconsin, USA","baseballguy"
2000,"2002-06-06",4.3,"bottle brown with garnet highlights,  dense tan head that would be at home atop any stout.  typical of a rogue, the aroma is almost visibly radiating with its masterful melange of malts. just to hazard an offbeat impression, id suggest it has a resemblance in bouquet to hot fudge on coffee ice cream.  once on the tongue that flavoring additive asserts itself, and while it does harmonize with the malt choir, it might be a shade too loud for people like me in the front row. as ive remarked about other skillfully orchestrated flavored beers, id love to taste this identical product without an ingredient which is probably more of a marketing device than a brewing refinement. that said, it works, its sweet and full bodied amid a creamy maple, desert beverage flavor. i concur that it warms charmingly, and the big bottle allows us that leisure. plenty of hop in the finish.  could be the perfect beer to accompany a fine cigar. maestro maier makes my life better.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"
2000,"2002-05-31",4.2,"Comment added yet again, 5/31: All that said, Ive got to downgrade it back to 4.2.  Love it, but isnt exactly quite as rich as Id really love it to be.

Comment added 5/16/02: This stuff has grown on me.  Love the stuff, and can hardly stop drinking it.  It kicks butt.  Makes me look forward with great anticipation putting it up against Boyne River Brown in a taste test.  Only question: will I possibly be sober by the end?

Orignal 1/25/02 comments, giving the beer a 4.2 rating:

I havent been a big fan of brown ales, but I bought this on the strength of Rogues reputation (with me, most importantly) for making quality brews, and as usual, Rogue doesnt disappoint.  I do like this one better than Newcastle and Sam Smiths.  Pretty mild taste- and aroma-wise, and tastes just how I think a brown ale should taste.  More richness comes out in the taste and aroma when it warms up, so for maximum effect and enjoyment, you should let this warm up from refrigerator temperature before you drink it.  (Myself, I enjoyed it more and more as it got warmer, so its a good lesson for next time I have one.)  Just a pleasant drink that goes down nice and smooth.  And quite nice was the fact that Rogue put this in a brown bottle rather than the clear ones.  No skunking much less any suspicious traces of it.  Newcastle and Sam Smith should take a hint.","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"
2000,"2002-05-28",4.3,"rerate 5/28/02: had to knock this a few points after experiencing the subtlety of Boyne River Brown. Oh. My. Deity. This beer just took Shakespeare off the top of my list. Nice hazelnut capuccino flavor. Definitely verges on being a porter. This is an excellent beer.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"
2000,"2002-05-25",4.3,"Dark brown color, nutty aroma. Flavor of nuts and vanilla. Pretty smooth and drinkable","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Darkover"

2000,"2002-05-22",3.6,"Well I love Brown Ales, but the Hazlenut flavor seems to cheapen the overall taste of ths beer.  Its kind of the same as flavored cigars and flavored coffee.  But I did find that the beer is quite refreshing and pairs really well with spicy mexican food!","Southampton, Pennsylvania, USA","amx1970390"

2000,"2002-05-07",4.0,"My new favourite Rogue.  Reminds me of a wonderful hazelnut-pecan pie.  Incredibly well done.  Brown ales are not usually my thing, but this is one exception I would like to keep stocked in my beer closet.","Pullman, Washington, USA","Merc"
2000,"2002-05-07",4.2,"another ingenius brew from Rogue.  Pours a deep ruby to brown shade.  Aroma is malty, vanilla and a nice hazelnut touch.  Full flavored, rich, creamy, roasted malt, nuts, honey, and a hazelnut flavors.  Wonderful soft palate, low carbonation, outstanding!","Pullman, Washington, USA","Gregory"
2000,"2002-05-02",3.8,"deep brown, tan foam. initial light molasses and woody notes. delicious... honey, vanilla, hazelnut, toffee with grainy tannic astringency.","Wilsonville, Oregon, USA","joet"
2000,"2002-04-24",4.5,"This brew pours a deep ruby brown.  The large tan head is creamy, frothy and very dense.  The head is mostly lasting and has good lacing.  The bold aroma is stellar.  When Im long dead and burning in hell, they are going to have me chained to the wall with one of these under my nose for me to whiff on for all eternity -with no hope of actually drinking it.  Hazelnuts dominate in addition to caramel, mild coffee, flowers, cheese, prunes, toffee, butterscotch, honey, and spices galore.  The flavor is also stellar.  It is warm, rich, complex, and very balanced.  Again hazelnuts dominate with coffee & toffee, spices, honey and some chocolate.  The long balanced finish is very clean.  The creamy body is medium to full with a very crisp fizzy carbonation that supplies plenty of bite.  This brew is almost porter speed.  Rogue Ales is quickly becoming my favorite Micro-Brewery.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"
2000,"2002-04-22",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 7, 2003 RE-RATE: Couldn't find this stuff again until I went to the Flying Saucer in Houston last weekend.  Loved it again, especially the smoky taste, and had to up it a little bit.  I also believe that this beer can bring you good luck.  ORIG RATING 4/22/02: 9-5-8-5-16: Incredible!!  How can a taste have such prominent hazelnut and honey without ruining it being beer?  By far the best nut brown I've ever had, I'm having another next time I'm out.  Toffe/caramel is also in the taste.  A complex blend of sweetness.  Nectar is a good word to describe it, too.  Okay, away from the incredible taste, it's also got a handsome brown color, and the nose is as good as how it is on your tongue.  Classic.","Mountain View, California, USA","AceOfHearts"
2000,"2002-04-22",4.6,"Holy smokes!  This ones a true champion.  Nutty, nutty.  Its got it all, folks.  Best nut brown.","Wheaton, Illinois, USA","AleHole99"
2000,"2002-04-20",3.5,"Quite impressive.  The hazelnut flavoring is present.  Sweet and malty.  As I recall, not to much hop presence.  My brother would enjoy this beer.","Virginia, USA","PTomkinson"
2000,"2002-03-28",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2003 Pours a dark brown color with a bit of orange.  Hazelnut aroma backed by sweet malts.  Firm bodied and ends sweet.  Hmmm...nutty and buttery.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
2000,"2002-03-22",3.9,"A very complex brew.  I got a lot out of this beer the more I drank it.  I tasted the nuttiness right off the bat, but the more I drank it, the more I got fruits and sweetness out of it.  The malts brought out a brown sugar taste...which balanced the hops nicely.  Very good beer to end the night with if you are on the town.","Katy, Texas, USA","Andrew196"
2000,"2002-03-21",3.8,"Fantastic beer.  Brillant aroma accompanied by beautiful color and wonderful taste.  Really appreciated how well the sweet yet measured hoppiness produced a wonderful flavor.  Neither overly sweet nor overly hoppy. Have been very impressed with Rouge beers so far.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","MMM...Beer"
2000,"2002-03-15",4.2,"Not the typically Rogue-ish hop fest you might expect. Incredibly decadent dark roasted chocolate, dry hazelnut, sweet toffeeish caramel. Even gained a slight port like character with food. May have lacked a little bitterness in the finish but did a great job without it. I have to say I loved this one.","California, USA","BeerLimey"

2000,"2002-01-04",3.6,"Best Brown I have tried so far.  Much more flavorful than Newcastle.  A little more hoppy than I expected, but I guess thats Rogue for you.  I agree with one poster that said it was a little thin on the palate (even though it poured thick), but it had enough going on that I still felt it deserved a 4 for palate.  Nice:)","Wilmar, Arkansas, USA","HarmonKill-a-Brew"
2000,"2001-12-23",4.0,"Well, Rogue left out the hops and bumped up the malt character on this one.  It makes for an incredibly rich, nutty and sweet brown.  Pleasant deep brown color with an eggshell head that didnt stick around.  Plenty of vanilla, toffee, sweet chocolate and subdued nuttiness in both aroma and flavor.  You could smell this one a mile away.  Starts very sweet and finishes a bit more subdued and refined.  Theres alot going on in this one.","Portsmouth, Virginia, USA","VA Homebrewer"
2000,"2001-12-21",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 28, 2003 The beer disembogues a transpicuous deep ruby color with a Bunyanesque sized head that is spumescent in texture and a beauteous tan color, as it ever so slowly transmogrifies the lace forms a thick and glutinous sheet to meld with the glass. A sweet nutlike malted aroma dominates hints of vanilla, quite fresh and clean, start quite sweet with the top a bit thin for my liking. Finish is moderate in carbonation with the hop personable in their spicy bite, quite dry with a lingering bittersweet flavor, drinkable as all Rogue beers are, but certainly not their best Whatever the name.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","Gusler"

2000,"2001-11-15",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 24, 2003 Deep red/brown.Pretty nice head and lace. Nice dessert-like aroma of chocolate and sweet hazelnut . Palate is full of sweet and roasted nuts mingling with a smooth malt profile. Body is a little thin but the finish is  rich,smooth hazelnut with a quick shot of hops at the end creating a little bit of dryness. Nice beer. Didnt think it was too sweet either.

2000,"2001-11-02",2.8,"sigh! alas....

my expectations were too high!

i was so excited to find a big bottle of this to try. but as has been the case with the other 2 rogues that ive tried, the hoopla was bigger than the actual beer.

i didnt get any sense of robust at all. it was sort of flat and thin, actually. 

very sweet, and it seems like there should have been something else to balance this sweetness out that just wasnt there.

i love hazelnut coffee, and i liked the aroma of this beer, but dang, i was disappointed with a rogue choice again! and i even let it warm up a bit as another reviewer suggested.

i actually liked the other two styles better than this one (mocha porter and shakespeare stout) even though they were so very hoppy.

my husband tasted this and his exact words were this beer rots.

i wouldnt go that far, but it certainly wasnt all that and a bag of chips as i was hoping it was going to be.","Florida, USA","delacerveza"

2000,"2001-07-10",4.3,"Best thing about this:  the head, beautiful in color and dissipates very slowly for the style.  Indicates higher-than-usual carb, which turns out to be right.

Chestnut brown, bright, thin head.  Aroma is mainly a toasty-roasty dark malt.  The flavour shows this as well, but brings in a sickly sweet artificial hazelnut element.
