2211,"2007-10-09",4.4,"KSBF 07 (this was brewed at the Newark location)  I think Justin is thier brewer there, and judging by this beer, he rocks.  This is the best Oktoberfest I have had this year, and maybe even better than Ramsteins.  Pours a nice clear orangy amber with nice subtle carbonation and a large frothy long lasting off white head- good lace.  Aroma is fresh baked bread, toasted malts, tons of light munich and vienna with light nuts and a subtle fresh floral hop touch.  Awesome full malty flavor with tons of toasted malts, light caramel flavor, but all munich and vienna- no sharp crystal malts used.  Good clean crisp finish with just a touch of hops in the end.  Smooth as hell.  One of the best beers at the fest by far.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","Dickinsonbeer"

Rich Vienna malt flavor with some good nutty and fruity depth.  Woody/earthy hops in the finish with moderate bitterness.  Moderately sweet, but not cloying.  Very sessionable.  One of the better Oktoberfests.  Not dull and trite like some.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"

Aroma of a grainy maltiness, toffee, caramel and a hint of citrus.  Flavor was also very grainy, cereal, nuts, caramel and some hints of hops to keep things interesting.  Nicely done Marzen.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
2211,"2006-06-07",3.6,"Poured an orange to light brown color with a very nice head that laced great. Excellent showing of carbonation rising to the surface through the translucent beer. The aroma was nil to nothing, very hard to pick up (even the breadiness that their description advertised). The flavor was nice and malty (definitely bready in flavor) with an underlying bitterness that helped keep the finish straight and balanced. Spices were lacking and there was a bubble gum aspect to the flavor up until the aftertaste, where it vanished. Mouthfeel was moderate bodied with definite carbonation. Biggest knock on this one was the absence of spicing in the flavor profile.","","User37895"

The taste and palate were very rich, firm, and complex, with hints of malt, toffee, caramel, nuts, and I swore I could taste a nutmeggy, pumpkin pie essence.  I took a growler of this and a growler of the Harvest Ale to go.  One of my top 20 marzens of all time.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
