404,"2015-10-03",3.6,"Draft at Arnolds, served in a pint glass. Pours a clear, bright gold with a small white head that settles into a ring and island of film, leaving spots of lace in the glass. Less sweet and more crisp and clean than other cream ales - straw, cereal, cracker, grass, mild peppery spice, cream, celery salt, and herbs. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a crisp, clean, not overly sweet mouthfeel. Good for the style, big time. Leave it to AleSmith.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

404,"2015-08-24",3.7,"Draught at Sunset Grille, 8/22/15.Clear blonde body is topped by a moderate amount of white head that fades to cover steadily.Light sourdough-like toasted malt, minerals, honeycream and just a touch of hay-like bitterness in the nose. Maybe not so cream ale-like but pleasant enough, with no flaws or alcohol.Some sweet malt notes up front are quickly dried out by a biscuity character that also has some light cereal flavors, very dry, grassy/hay-like bitterness and very minimal fruitiness. Lots of club soda-like notes, a very watery, light body which is quite enjoyable and no flaws nor fizziness. Pretty nice cream ale, not quite as well-constructed as the Medusa Luminary I just had, but very light, quite clean and drinkable, if a bit unremarkable.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

404,"2015-07-05",3.5,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2015 Taster at the brewery. Golden color with white ring. Fresh vegetables, fruity, clean, slightly bitter. Like a great Pilsener, just without the crispness from the carbonation. Whatever a Cream Ale is, this is fun and easy drinking.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","SinH4"
404,"2015-02-07",3.3,"July 10th, 2013 - The photo I took for this beer sample looks like a storm from the dust bowl. Light playing off the gas has turned into long-exposure star lines, and the brown soup is a fuzzy, degenerate block of color. However, the flavor is still there and described in legible characters: clean, crisp and fresh more like a pilsener, with meal-time tastes like vegetables and peas. The aroma also points to pilsners, with a snappy, clean scent, as well. Not ""creamy"", yet good.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

404,"2014-11-19",3.1,"On tap at The Hopping Pig in San Diego. Pours a light yellow with a thin white head. Very slight floral aroma. Follows through on the flavor. Not much there but a slight floral hint. This is an upscale lawnmower beer. Nice.

404,"2014-09-10",3.2,"""Definitely not a favorite style, but a favorite brewer, so there was hope of a style-redifing moment. Alas, it was not to be. Solid brew. Good for the style, but not enough to come near ANY of their other offerings. Light amber pour, aroma and flavor of hay and sweet malt. Feel thin and slightly creamy with a touch of lactose on the palate. Just pretty good. Was hoping for more.""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
404,"2014-08-22",3.9,"Draft at 38 Degrees. Brilliant clear golden with good lacing. Grassy, lemon, grain aroma. Subtle but nice. Great smooth restrained grain flavor, maybe a touch more hops than most cream ales. Crisp and refreshing mouthfeel with a good carb level. Really a standout in this boring style.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
404,"2013-11-13",3.0,"Draft at brewery. Pours clear and golden yellow with white head. Not much on the nose. Theres a corn sweetness on the tongue. Finishes clean. Its the best of a shit style. They probably made it for all the people who tag along with the beer geeks who ask for the closest thing to Coors Light.","Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, USA","DiarmaidBHK"
404,"2013-10-19",3.3,"UPDATED: AUG 31, 2014 Decent cream ale on tap at the brewery, not my favorite either, but drinkable and sweet. Gold pour, white head, some vanilla in taste and nose, okay.","Santa Monica, California, USA","DedicatedToFun"
404,"2013-09-22",3.6,"On tap @ AleSmith. Nice golden lemon color with a tightly packed ivory head. Citrus, lactose, creamsicle-like with a thick, coating texture and light carbonation. Not a huge fan of the style but this was tasty and highly drinkable.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
404,"2013-09-10",3.6,"On tap @ Alesmith. Pours golden yellow, with a thick eggshell white head. Smells like sweet malt, grassy hay, bread and a little musky hops. Taste is bread, wet hay, light malt and a little hops. This is a thin bodied carbonated beer. Reminds me more of a lager than a cream ale.","Arizona, USA","JBoan"
404,"2013-08-29",3.4,"Draft at Urge Gastropub. Crystal clear pale yellow, with a large sticky white head. Light sweetness, very crackery, grass, and light earthy hops. Very clean easy drinking.","San Diego, California, USA","JohnnyJ"
404,"2013-08-24",3.7,"Taster at the brewery. Pale gold color with a small white head that has fair retention. The nose was light and somewhat indistinct with hay and grass. The flavor was rather pleasant with hay, breads, gains, biscuit and a touch of vanilla. The palate was full and smooth with medium carbonation. Finishes medium in duration and dry. Overall: decent cream ale.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"

404,"2013-07-09",3.6,"On tap at The Hopping Pig - San Diego, CA. Light pale malt nose. Flavor is very easy going and lightly sweet. Clean and gentle. There are some deeper, slightly starchy qualities to the mid-palate, but on the whole, no surprise, AleSmith makes a cleanly, friendly, and fresh Cream Ale that goes down easy.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
404,"2013-07-06",3.2,"Tap at Pizza Port OB. Clear gold with a finger of white head, decent retention. A little corn in the aroma, more in the flavor. Also a decent carbonic bite as well. Maybe a touch of herbal hops, but very light. Semi-dry, bitterness peaked at a 2. Moderate carbonation with a light body. Would be a good lawnmower beer. Nothing wrong with it, but I prefer Spotted Cow. If I rated to style itd probably get a better review.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"
404,"2013-07-05",3.5,"Tap at The Salted Pig, Riverside CA. Clear, sparkling light golden with thicker white foam. Huge sheets of lacing. Nose brings sweet corn bread, butter, vanilla, white cake, shortbread. Intentional prohibition style DMS/creamed corn. Taste follows suit- sharper near malt liquor ""spike"" on the palate with corn bread, DMS. High, stinging carbonation. Good for style, sadly an inferior style.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
