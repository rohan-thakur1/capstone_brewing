752,"2012-06-22",2.9,"Poured from a bomber in a wide flute. Light golden color, though not transparent. Lots of bubbles and a nice inch plus of head.

Hops, citrus, mostly a grapefruit smell with a softer note at the end of honey. Smells great.

Bitter at first, bitter in the middle, slight rye spice in the middle but very faint. I was expecting more rye to come though in the taste. The hops are great... but I really wanted some rye.

Crisp and light with a moderate to high amount of carbonation. The level of carbonation is not good to this beer. Now halfway through the bottle the carbonation is really annoying. It is all I can think about, which is not what I want to be thinking about while drinking a beer.

752,"2012-03-29",3.6,"In short: A very straightforward honeyed rye beer.  I like rye beer.
How: Bottle 22oz, consumed fresh a few weeks after receiving it from TURDFERGUSON, thanks a lot Sam
The look: Almost clear dark blonde body topped by a very small white head
In long: Nose is unmistakably rye with a true rye bread aroma.  Taste is smooth and straight forward, this is a not very hoppy rye ale like a Founders Reds Rye, Bear Republic Hop Rod Rye or a Terrapin Rye Squared (to name a few well known ones).  This is a straightforward rye beer with a mild citrusy hopping. A bit of honey and some floral hops, smooth carbonation.  Overall this is as straightforward of a rye beer as one can imagine, except that it is a bit on the sweet side with a strong honey presence.  I liked it because I like rye beers but dont expect anything more than a beer that tastes like rye.

The beer pours a hazy golden color with a small head that leaves the glass lightly laced. 

The aroma is fruity with some lotion and soap up front and a caramel character that is verging on unpleasant but thankfully steers clear. This beer smells really nice and is generally all about fruit forward hops, the way I described it in my notes makes it sound like it smells awful, but it doesnt... its lotion-y, soapy, caramel-y, and fruity in the best ways possible... kinda weird. 

The flavor is mildly sweet with tons of peachy and apricot fruitiness. The beer is very hop forward but just mildly bitter, the bitterness thats there goes a long way in the balance of the beer.

The flavor is wonderfully balanced. The more of this I taste the more
I enjoy it. Everything is harmonious. Hops are prominent and refreshing
while the rye is spot on for a dryish, bready balance. Sweetwater
excels in the hoppy ways of American tradition and this is no exception.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
752,"2010-10-14",3.0,"Strange mix in this beer between the rye and the hops. It pours into a bubbly haze. The beer has a crisp and fizzy mouthfeel. I always like the rye flavor, which in  this is case s mixed with a lemon-bread flavor.","Georgia, USA","AR"
752,"2010-10-12",3.3,"22 from greens. Mostly grassy but kind of orange aroma. Flavor is grassy up front and then it fades into a bitterness that im not a big fan of. Has a bit to do with the rye and then the finishing hops combining into something that reminds me a little too much of chewing grass or pine cones. Everything up until this point in the drink though is pretty good and bordering on one of sweetwaters better offerings to date. Just that damn finish then screws it all up.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
752,"2010-10-05",3.9,"1 pt 6 oz bottle. Pours a somewhat hazy golden color with a small white head. It has a wonderful citrus hop aroma along with a rye aroma. This is a excellent beer.  It tastes of lemon and grapefruit up front followed by a hop bitterness and rye taste. The body is a bit thin.Its very refreshing. I would buy this one again.","Dacula, Georgia, USA","DarkSong"
752,"2010-10-02",3.7,"22oz bottle.  Golden amber color.  Aroma of heavy resin,  grapefruit, hop oil heaven.  Flavor of spicy bread, citrus rind.  Sticky malt, spicy pepper tingle, bitter hops.","Georgia, USA","unclemattie"
752,"2010-09-30",3.7,"22oz bottle, fresh.  Pours semi-hazy golden amber with a one finger white head that leaves a nice ring of lacing and holds a fair cap.  Aroma is pretty hoppy, a lot of citrus, oranges, pineapple, some rye underneath all the hops and a little bit of bread and yeast.  Flavor features a good deal of citrusy hops along with some spice from the rye, not complex, but quite tasty.  Medium bitterness and finishes very dry.  Quite crisp and refreshing.  Mouthfeel is thin to medium bodied, medium to high carbonation.  I came into this expecting a hopped-up rye beer and that is exactly what I got.  The rye takes a backseat to the citrus, but still manages to make its presence known.  Good stuff.  Wouldve been a great beer to enjoy on a hot summer day.","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"

752,"2010-09-27",3.8,"The cloudy golden yellow appearance, and the foamy head gave a lot a AIPA vibes, and the spicy-herbal hop smell that followed reinforced them.  Other than those hops, there was some toasted grain smell in the background, which I suspect was from the rye malt,  The taste was a lot less bitter than I expected, but that allowed a floral and slightly earthy tone to be established.  There was a simple sweetness to counterbalance this.  The finish was very spicy and short.  The beer felt very English to me due to the relatively straightforward construction with an emphasis on sessionability.  The light mouthfeel also seemed indicate that this was the intent all along.  Very quaffable on a summer night.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
752,"2010-09-24",3.3,"#7, bottle
Appearance:  Pours a cloudy amber gold with a sudsy small white head. Leaves behind webby lacing.

Aroma: Tangerine, pineapple and musty, rained on earth.

Taste: Right out of the gate, a large burst of hops, earthy malts, then the beer falls off a cliff into nothing. It amazes me how something that starts off at the gate so strong goes so quickly to nothing. My mouth is big, but not that big.

Mouthfeel: Thin, watery, modest carbonation.

Overall:  A bit thin for me. Great aroma and initial taste, but the beer leaves much to be desired all and all.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"
752,"2010-09-22",4.2,"22oz bomber. Pours cloudy golden orange with almost-greenish straw highlights and a white, fluffy head that leaves lace on the glass. Awesome hop nose - citrus and hints of spice - with a bready and lightly sweet malt aroma. Flavor starts malty and sweet with an influx of crisp grainy rye and citrusy juicy hops. Very rich, bready, toasty malt backbone with dry, citrusy, slightly grassy hop bitterness. Finish is dry and bitter but with a slowly growing wave of caramel on top of the bready malts. Mouthfeel is well-bubbled with a medium-full body that is both creamy and tickly. Overall, a fantastic IPA. Great hop character but with awesomely balanced malt character, too.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"
752,"2010-09-20",3.3,"Pours a clear golden color with a white head. Aroma is caramel, honey, rye, some citrus, and earthy. Flavor is caramel, toast, spicy rye, and a bitter earthy spicy finish.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","shp555"
752,"2010-09-19",3.5,"Pours a hazy golden orange with a small frothy white head that recedes to a soapy swirl on top with some stray lines of lacing along the sides.

Aroma is bright with lemon zest and grassy hops alongside the spicy rye.  Some bready malts in the nose as well, almost toasty.

The taste is spicier than the aroma, with the first taste being full of tingly, spicy rye malt character.  The hops are still there though, a mix of grassy floral hops and light citrusy grapefruit.

The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied and prickly with both hops and the rye.  There is a touch of creaminess from the rye, but it feels largely like an IPA.

This is slightly spicier version of Terrapins RyePA.  Very drinkable.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

752,"2010-09-17",3.7,"16 ounce pint - $4.75 at Taco Mac in Canton, Georgia.

Appearance: Lightly hazed, medium-toned copper body with a wee-sized, though persistent, white head.

Smell: Aroma of citrus-scented hops, zesty rye grains, and with a simple addition of pale malts and a backing of faint, faint floral accents.

Taste: Mild opening of pale malted barley with a touch of toastiness soon advances into a taste of zippy, piquant rye malt vaguely hinting at huskiness. Slightly citric white grapefruit with a modest, grassy herbaceousness providing an additional bit of spice. Moderate bitterness throughout. As it warms, a late-arriving reappearance of sweetness develops. Continued rye character on the light, drying finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-light body. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: The relatively light body aids the ease of drinkability. Overall, a decent, fitting beer for a worthy cause.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
752,"2010-09-16",3.8,"Bomber, $3.99 from Bullocks.  Hazy orange pour, almost opaque, nice looking white head.  Thick.  Aroma was of earthy hops, some citrus, pale malt and rye.  Flavors start off with some earthy characteristics, bready malts, rye, then some floral hops come in later, very dry.  Nice hoppy finish, smooth.  Mouthfeel was medium bodied, nice carbonation.  This was a nice earthy hopped up ale.  Good stuff, and brewed for a good cause.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","mixmasterob"
