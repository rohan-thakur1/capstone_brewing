4456,"2017-05-09",4.4,"750 ml bottle @ Radikal whale slaying, Thessaloniki. Thank you Eric! Hazy golden orange color with white to off white head. Yeasty and light malty aroma, funky, barnyard, dusty, grapes - vinous, floral notes, tart citrusy fruity, stone fruits too - peach. Light sweet and moderate acidic sour taste like aroma. Medium oily body with soft carbonation.","GREECE","rouhlas"
4456,"2017-04-23",4.1,"Pours hazy orange with a small white head. Aromas of white grapes, overripe peaches, cheesy funk, light vinegar, red apples, tannins. Taste is vinegary, green apple skin, green grapes, same overripe stone fruit, horsey funk, sweet oaky and tannic finish.","Aarhus N, DENMARK","Klimaet"
4456,"2017-04-17",3.3,"My Bottom Line:
Pink grapefruit stacked on hay in a musty basement; not the most evocative Fruit Lambic.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam dips into the misty blond.
-Acetone is perceived quite clearly after a couple of sips.
-Wheat stands out nicely through.
-The musty funk pervades the fruitiness and the white grapes do not succeed in standing out.

Bottle.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
4456,"2017-04-17",3.5,"Bottle shared, thanks Simon! Cloudy pale gold pour with thin white head. Aroma is funky, light acetic notes, grapefruit pulp, basement dusty aromas. Taste is acidic, slightly bitter, musty lambic. Palate is light bodied, dry with light carbonation. Good.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
4456,"2017-04-16",3.5,"Bottle (750 m) at tasting. Massive thanks to Simon for sharing! Hazy orangey-golden with a small bubbly white head, moderate retention, leaving little lacing. Aroma is dominated by some pretty intense funk and buttery oak, white grapes, moderate spiciness, light rotten notes and cobweb/basement notes. Taste is similar with strong funk and buttery oak with plenty of ""basement"" character, light mineral notes, white grapes and moderate spiciness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. Tannic mouthfeel. Funky finish. Its heavily funk and quite bold in the oak and ""butter"" department which makes this one rather unbalanced and somewhat uneasy to drink. Simon, who shared this bottle and had one recently at the brewery, told us that the other bottle he tried was much better than this one so hopefully I can try it again sometines in the future.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
4456,"2017-03-22",4.4,"March 18, 2017, Bottle at Cantillon, vintage 2009. 
Hazy orange with a small white head. Aroma is a great blend of fruit and funk with white grapes, earthy apricot skins, barnyard funk, some brett ripe fruit notes, damp woody cellar, minerals. 
Taste is soft sour, fruity and funky. Medium bodied, smooth carbonation. Finish is smooth sour with a dry feature, grape skins, unripe apricot, oak and mineral notes, funky barnyard and murky wood. 
Great one!","Stockholm, SWEDEN","hackobock"
4456,"2016-10-04",4.6,"bottle shared during zwanze day at cantillon, vintage 2009, prob. the most expensive bottle ive bought at cantillon. poured murky yellow to light golden with a white head. such a big amount of old funk, big old cellar notes, cowwebs, light grains, big tart vineous white wine notes, oak, big sour funk aftertaste, citrus, so much white grape notes after these years.","Alingsås, SWEDEN, SWEDEN","markextrae"

Pours a hazy, bright orange color with a tiny, bubbly film of lacing to it.

Smells of grassy, young grapes which got a nice floral quality, complimented by a faint wild honey note. Got a nice mushroom leaden funk foundation to it, with a hovering unripe berry tartness on top.

Lower carbonated, with a black pepper spiciness amongst a pungent wall of tartness, while drinking easy and pleasantly refreshing.

Got a dried red apple peel fruit note together with some rotten wood bark and soft grape peel. Turns very dry after this initial sweeter whiff, with a pungent, lemony tartness to it till the end, with some earth and dust cutting through.

Very nice, surprisingly sour with a nice, light bodied, soothing grape appearance.","GERMANY","aleigator"
4456,"2016-10-02",4.7,"Most of a 750 ml. bottle @ Cantillon. Pricey stuff but I do get them. Very hazy apricot peach, pretty big creamy head. Nose is huge dank barnyard funk, very funky but also mellow, dank, cellar, creamy barnyard funk, white grape & yeasty peach. Murky taste, very big on the barn & funk but mellow at the same, all flavours have run over into one another, lightly mineral, dank, big cellar fruit, easy murky apricot & vague funky grapes that are no longer all that clearly identifiable as grapes, yeasty, murky. Mellow, lovely funk, fruit has gone all barnyard & rustic. Murky & creamy body very nice funky treat.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
4456,"2016-09-30",4.2,"Pours unclear blonde, good white head. Smell is intense, rather Sharp, bit sour, some fruit . Taste is intense, huge funk ( biggest funk yet in a Cantillon ) dry, super oaky. The vintage ( 7 years ) definately shows ! Still fruity though. Very Nice !","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"

4456,"2016-09-08",4.1,"Bottle at the brewery. Really hazy peach color with a bit of white foam. Aroma has bee wax, some honey, wood and fermented fruits. Taste starts with sour grapes, slight honeycomb, hay and dusty wood. Really complex taste, overall a really nice lambic.","Timisoara, ROMANIA","ciocanelu"
