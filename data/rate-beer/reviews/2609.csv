2609,"2015-06-27",3.7,"0,5lt bottle @ Valentin - Curious Bierkneipe, Volos
Not very strong typical banana aroma, crystal clear appearance with typical a lot white head that remains, taste very carbonated (as it should be for the category) but not as swee(more sour) as a regular Weizen with yeast, again very lively in your mouth with a light-medium body and not very long aftertaste.
For the hot (greek summer) just the right Weizen option.","Volos, GREECE","WhatDaddy"

An enjoyable beer.","Corbett, Oregon, USA","Fatehunter"
2609,"2011-12-22",3.6,"train bottle.  surprisingly pleasant estery banana wheat citrus nose. medium-full body with frothy carbonation. I expected something worse, honestly. its a bit filmy and oily but the carbonation, body and yeast all work pretty well together. mild to medium strong peppery esters late. has some generic berry flavor but its nicely frothy and creamy, and doesnt seem stripped by filtration. give this to me blind in a mug and Id say its a hefeweizen and say i love it just as much.  makes me want to sample the Bischofshof hefeweizen.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

2609,"2004-03-13",3.1,"Quite deep old gold colour for a wheat beer. I get the bubblegum in the aroma too, but not unpleasant, with flowery peachy notes too. Flavour is tart and crisp, with a little underlying sweetness. Acidic finish and, yes, a metallic tang does appear in the aftertaste. Nonetheless, I quite enjoyed this - a pleasant refreshing drink.

2609,"2003-07-26",3.9,"strange cheesy aroma that could be mistaken for staleness (not a very fresh bottle). very salty and sour with plenty of alcohol peering through. very good for a kristall, less fruity than most weizens but with more of all the other flavours that you would expect to be in there","Plzen, CZECH REPUBLIC","motelpogo"
