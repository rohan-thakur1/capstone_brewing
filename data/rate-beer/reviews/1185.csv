1185,"2017-04-08",4.3,"Enjoy By 4/20/2017 - poured into IPA glass
Aroma: soft layers of citrus (lemon, lime, grapefruit), passion fruit and even guava. spicy, piney hop notes. these overwhelm any contribution from malt. but its fine.
Appearance: pours deep golden by definition with an inch thick perfectly white frothy head. This beer is crystal clear and displays excellent lacing. close to perfect.
Taste: following from the aroma, tropical fruits are all over, sweet slightly caramely malt flavors combined with full-on alpha acid attack bitterness which actually diminishes just slightly as beer warms. there is a faint alcohol warmth present which I dont remember detecting with previous versions.
Palate: medium/full body. oily, resiny texture, high/crisp carbonation and pronounced astringency. Finishes sweet-ish and long... almost intense levels of bitterness lingering...
Overall: not the most drinkable or best of the Enjoy Bys that Ive had. Pretty intense on the bittering but still a top notch DIPA. when you get compared to perfection... its a tough act to follow.","Miami, Florida, USA","Rumbero"

Anyway, it is just as good as I remembered. The dank stank it exudes is pungent and hoppy. It pours a luscious golden hue. The whole thing is a wonderful gnarl of resiny piney lemony grapefruity hoppy deliciousness that goes down pretty smooth and easy for 9.4% abv. Definitely one of the better beers Ive had from Stone, which is saying something. Good for waiting for weird Japanese RPGs to finish downloading and rocking out to some moderate volume jams from Fleetwood Mac all while you miss your special someone.","New Haven, Connecticut, USA","meccahh69lol"

Big, juicy-hop aroma of cannabis buds doused in tangerine and grapefruit. It sure is an American (double) IPA. As expected the palate consists of a medium-full feel with grapefruit and some pine. Finishes bitter and alcohol makes its presence known. Lets see how this holds up for a day with a wine preserver stopper, since this is a heavy brew. Ill throw this in with all the other good to very-good IPAs available, and taking space away from other styles on market shelves.","","balloonbuffoon"
1185,"2017-03-28",4.3,"Enjoy By 4.20.17. Massively pungent nose, grapefruit and pine and ganja wafting up from the pint, promising one hell of a green IPA. Looks nice as well, deep, glowing gold topped off by a healthy dollop of foam and ample lace. First sip: hops, hops, hops, juicy and piney and citric, orange-grapefruit and bitter lemon. After: grows unexpectedly sweet for a big Stone IPA, a giant caramel malt base playing off the varying hop flavors. Toasty on the back end, with a lingering pinecone bitterness, yet not palate-destroying in its longevity. Feels divine, not a trace of the 9.4% ABV, Dear lord, this beast is way, way too easy to drink. Trouble in a bottle. Delicious. I think Ill go enjoy some more.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

The aroma is quite magnificent and very enticing. The flavor matches the aroma. There is a bunch of malt flavoring hitting with the citrusy grapfefruits, hop resin, pine cones, and white bread.

No overt boozy character. 11/12APPEARANCE: Flame orange hue; fairly hazy but Co2 visible. Large bright white froth retains and laces extremely well. 3/3FLAVOR: Lightly sweet peach or other stone fruit (no pun intended) immediately. Citrusy hops follow with a slight orange juice flavor.

Couleur : Blonde, belle mousse au-dessus du liquide et une bonne effervescence pour couronner cette bière.

Arôme : Au nez, on distingue un houblon assez résineux, peut-être également assez floral. Un peu agrumé au nez également.

1185,"2016-04-08",4.9,"The beer poured a lovely shade of golden, with one a crystal clear body. The head was a little small, barely measuring at one finger thick. The aroma was very dank, smelling of grapefruit and pine resin. The taste was superlative. I was blown away by the assault of the dank piney and citric hops strong enough to strip teeth enamel. The hops were backed by simple pale malts that provided just a touch of sweetness. This was a sticky hop bomb, and coated my tongue, and throat going down, providing a long lingering hop aftertaste. The alcohol was well hidden, making this very drinkable despite the near double digit ABV. This is an essential beer if you are a hophead. I thought I had already reviewed it before now, but I was wrong about that. You can bet this is going to be a go to purchase for me from now on.

9.4%ABV. Double IPA.

Tapped out a rich cloudy light Amber. 9ºSRM.

Nose is pineapple. This would be bright yellow fleshed, sweet pineapple from the Philippines or Sarawak. There are the more traditional deScriptors of pine and resin. The nose also has a rich sour funk in the base notes of the aroma that are remiscent of the funk you appreciate in a cane sugar processing plant, where the raw cane liquor is being boiled down. This funkiness that you usually associate with humidity and heat is likely a function of the rich yeasty aroma which you get strongest near the bottom of your first pint. The nose is fresh and rich at the same time. 

Mouthfeel is soapy and sudsy and rich. Carbonation is pronounced and just right for such a richly endowed brew. Beautiful roast malt sweetness starting with a robust carbohydrate palate of cracked barley loaves, rough country rye bread, graham cracker pie crust, Animal Crackers, and while were on crackers, you also get some nice ginger snaps with both richness and that cute spiciness. There are more obvious caramel, toffee and roasted chestnut flavors. You get some nice bread like flavors like those coming out of a freshly baked crunchy chewy baguette. Some nice raw dough freshness in the palate as well. 

Hop flavors are pine, resin, hyssop, collard greens, kale, Dandelion green and arrowroot richness.

Finish is just herbaceous clean and with a hint of hyssop aggressiveness, but not outright aggression, more like knowing, nod of the head, raise of the eyebrow sort of passive aggression, my favorite kind!!

Goes on Favorites List!
Goes on All Time Favorites List!

1185,"2015-10-17",4.1,"Visual: Pours clear golden yellow with a smallish head, micro hazy retention, sticky micro lacing, lots of steady streams.

Nose: bursting fresh grapefruity citrus hops, like fresh picked, grassy (lvl-9)-pungency

Attack: whipped creamy-crisp, incoming citrus hops

Mid-palate: silky CO2, (lvl-4)-sweetness, (MAIN) orange-tangerine oils, toffee-citrus malts, grassy-resin

Finish: super-soft hopped bitter malty sharp finish.

Summary: You live for those moments when you taste something special, and this is something special. Extremely creamy silky mouthfeel, almost as if nitrogenated. Remarkably gradual hoppy bitterness, notice the stealth. Tons of hop oil. Also well-hidden ABV. Great IIPA.","","sulawang"

1185,"2015-10-15",4.0,"Poured from cool painted brown glass bottle into Spieglau IPA glass, a light orange amber colour, slight chill haze and suspended hop matter, with sudsy long-lasting white foam, lots of lace. Sturdy caramel-sweet maltbill holding up EXTREME hoppiness, truly one of the most intensely hoppy IPAs Ive ever tasted, even considering my own insane homebrew experiments. Quite a remarkable feat, so I can understand why they insist you drink it super fresh. Grapefruit, mango, peach, papaya, grassy, weedy, herbal, vegetal, basil, anise, black pepper, coriander, sawdust, earth, hot tomato garden, curry seasoning, foxy wine grapes, faint musk. Bewideringly complex. Severely bitter without becoming unpleasant. 13 different pungent hop varieties, added to the mash, early and late boil, whirlpool, and copious dry-hopping. The very definition of a hop bomb. At 9.4% abv, it is undeniably boozy, too much so for my taste, but (a) the alcoholic solvent aspect produces an interesting perfume effect, and (b) the beer is so unique and delicious in every other way, I cant really fault it. I think this is my first time tasting Delta and Helga hops. Of course its impossible to parse out individual varietal contributions in a nuclear explosion like this, but its still my nerdy fun fact for the day. Well-crafted, unique and audacious.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"

Bière possédant tous les attributs dune Impériale IPA traditionnelle. Un peu dalcool au nez mais aussi et surtout cette résine sapineuse qui à mon nez balaie toute autre forme de nuance. En me forçant, jai limpression dy déceler un fruit rouge. De la canneberge? Les saveurs très houblonnées de cette bière sont typiques de ces IIPA résineuses alors ce nest pas une grande nouveauté pour personne, mais jai plus quadoré lappariement avec ce plat scandinave de hareng cru - le maatges. Le hareng cru est laissé à pourrir et avant quil soit complètement impropre à la consommation, il est entièrement lavé et nettoyé des vers quil contient. Le poisson est servi ainsi, cru, sur un lit doignons avec pour seuls aromates, un peu de sel et un filet dhuile dolive.

Scivola dalla bottiglia al bicchiere senza paura, oro antico con qualche riflesso ambrato. Schiuma bianca e persistente, abbondante inizialmente ma poi compatta. Non scompare fino a fine bevuta. limpidissima, appena la schiuma si compatta lascia emergere un bouquet di odori non da ridere. Anans sulle prime, intenso e fresco. Ma anche pino, scorza darancia, qualche vegetale ed un po di pesca. Buonissima lintensità, forse si poteva essere un filo più puliti,ma è pura capziosità, un cavillo inutile. In bocca non si discosta molto dalla dolcezza pervenuta inizialmente al naso. Cè lananas, che lascia spazio ad un brevissimo intervallo di pane dolce. Il tempo di assestarsi e trovarsi un nuovo amaro, che è frutto di scorza di limone e darancia, leggeri sentori di pompelmo, che guidano ad un finale fatto di erba, di verde, un po di pino, nella maniera giusta, e larrivo della pesca che con un filo di dolcezza riequilibria lultima volta la giocata. Questo, forse, è laspetto più importante. In bocca nessun sapore eccede, sono tutti presenti e tutti giocano il loro ruolo. Perfetto, in equilibrio. Con il palato cè un feeling estremo, poi. La birra è leggermente oleosa ma liscissima, nessuna pesantezza. Il finale è amaro ma secco, estremamente secco. Questo permette alla pesca di riemergere e di non avvertire quasi mai lalcool che pure è abbastanza marcato. Una birra, insomma, sicuramente potente, fresca e decisamente buonissima.","ITALY","Fashawn"

1185,"2015-06-12",2.9,"My Bottom Line:
Harsh alcohol, medicinal lengths and plastic-like moments attack this Double IPAs floral and citrusy hops, bewildering the palate completely.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A veil of foam tops the translucent golden.
-The mouthfeel was lean and geared towards drinkability.
-However, the booming alcohol made this awful on the drinkability scale.
-I have no idea why this one got served... My palate was fresh as well, having just had a pint of their wonderful Go To IPA before it. Id like to fault myself here, but I dont see what I could have done wrong in this case.
-Will try it again since its gotten so many great ratings. Surely there must have been something awry with the glass, the tap line, something...

 Enjoy By 12.13.13 IPA (9 days to spare)

 Appearance  The beer pours a clear orange-amber color with a billowy two finger just off-white colored head. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading over time to leave a nice level of thick foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma is big and sweet with tons of tropical fruit aromas. Mango, papaya, and tangerine all make a strong sweet showing with some lighter hints of some pear and peach as well. Along with the sweeter fruit smells is a good level of hop aroma. A pine hop smell is the greatest, but other hop aromas of grapefruit and some grass are there as well, rounding out the overall hop aroma profile. With a hint of an alcohol smell mixed with the rest, the aroma is overall pleasantly fruity and hopped with a nice warming smell.

 Taste  The taste begins with the sweeter tropical fruit flavors that were detected in the nose, as well as a moderately strong presence of hop. The tropical fruits are heaviest of a tangerine sweetness, but contain nice notes of mango, pineapple, and papaya as well. The hop that begins the taste, is of a more pine like flavor, with it starting out on the lighter side and getting stronger as the flavor advances to the middle. Beyond these two flavor types, there is also a nice doughy flavor mixed in there as well, which with the sweeter tropics, creates an unchanging base for the hop profiles to evolve upon. While the pine hop grows stronger more toward the middle of the taste, it is joined by other hop flavors of an earthy and grapefruity nature. The pine then starts to fade ever so slightly with the grapefruit getting stronger and a little bit of a caramel sweetness sneaking onto the tongue toward the end. At the very end the earthy flavors along with a woodsy flavor really ramp up in the taste, and with the nice sweet and doughy backdrop and other hop flavors, end up leaving a rather pleasantly fruity and hopped flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is a bit on the lower side. The thick body is fantastic for accentuating the hop tastes on top of the sweeter tropical fruits and doughy flavors, with the lower carbonation only enhancing the feel of the thick body even more.

 Overall This was a very enjoyable IPA. Rather balanced for a stone brew in my opinion and not quite what I was anticipating. It blended a sweeter and thicker base with a nice hop profile, making for one very enjoyable sipper.","","Darkmagus82"

Poured from a 22.oz bottle into Portsmouth tulip glass.

The color is a deep darker orange with a finger of white head with some nice lacing left on the glass. There a cloudy look to this beer that blocks the light out a bit does have a slight yellowish hue in the margins.

The smell is very piney hops flavored bringing a spruce aroma. There is a saturated clementine aroma that brings a bright citrus aroma that is hard brings visions of pulp to mind.

The taste of this beer is citrus at first but as it goes toward the back of the younger it pastes a layer of pine flavor hops that have slight sting as the go down. A slight scrape of the tongue by the bitterness of the hops is felt but feels like a battle scar since there is also tinge of pleasure there as well. At the corners of the mouth there is a nice slight tangerine flavor that resides there for a short time.

The feel of this beer a has a nice fullness that feels like it surrounds the pallet but does not engulf the entire mouth. This feels like a big IPA but does not hit hard either but slips into a push into hops here, there, and everywhere.","Cumberland, Rhode Island, USA","Duhast500"

1185,"2014-07-16",4.5,"At home from a 22-oz. bottle, 07.04.14 edition (bottled on 05/28/14). Arrowine - the fantastic wine/beer/cheese shop in Arlington, VA - had this beer reduced from $8.99 to $6.99 due to it being past expiration. However, its still really tasty, as to be expected. Ive had this on draft in its youth, and am well aware it hasnt really aged all that much. In fact, Im loving it more now than ever. Consider it context influencing my rating...

Aroma: fresh grapefruit, juicy overripe pineapple, almost the sweet notes of durian (in a good way) - this is a classic California IPA! Hoppy and boozy, theres no mistaking what style this is.

Appearance: mellow gold, clear with gentle bubbles that keep things lively, fine white head.

Taste: well-balanced with the hops and sweetness to keep you going back for more, though may be missing a bit of the bite from it pushing a couple months in the bottle. Still, surprisingly easy to drink at 9.4% ABV.

Palate: full body, a bit oily in texture (no doubt thanks to the fresh hops), an average carbonation to keep things fresh, and a nice long finish thats quite satisfying.

Overall: this is a great beer, particularly yummy with the rotisserie chicken from neighboring Crisp & Juicy. Im awfully glad I bought two!","Washington DC, USA","b3playr"

1185,"2014-07-06",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 27, 2016 June 15th, 2014 - Another entry in the local favorite, the Stone Enjoy By series, imploring drinkers to drink often and drink early. This aureate beer teases the nose with an extremely fresh smell of pine, white grape juice, and that cottony, soft sweetness of a delicate angel food cake. The taste is mild at first, so much so that I am taken aback by the relative temerity of this brew. Is this truly Stone? To add to the shock, the flavor gets smoother as it warms, and as my palate acclimates, with a long, low mild aftertaste. This feels as foreign to Stone as humility, though some of the sugar profile from the apple, white grape juice and champagne is familiar. While it may not be true to form (a black sheep amongst demons) I think it is quite lovely, and invites slow sipping even if it isnt battering my tongue with a baseball bat wrapped in thorns and hop cones.

November 30th, 2012 - (3.8) Stones next iteration in the expiration series demands a pre-Christmas consumption. The color is the standard grain colored gold with a white head and a short statured head, and from this we catch touches of a bright and weedy smell. Grassy memories of soccer matches as a kid and clumsy face first tumbles into the turf are conjured here in the scent, with some spurts of pineapple juice, and even a bite or two of fresh, peppery mango. The flavor is milder than expected, given the nose, with a balanced mellowness. The intensity of the flavor is flat and predictable, consistent from beginning to end, but hoppy and well colored. Its that Stone hop profile thats practically Kochs signature, but it works well here, with all its marijuana and orange overtones, and once again, I am inclined to drinking this well before its date. 7/3/8/4/16

November 30th, 2012 (3.7) - Notes for the 12.21.12 batch. This is my first of many run-ins with the Stone Enjoy By brews, and it has all the marks of a Stone Brew, to be sure. The nose is filled with lemon, lemon feel, lemon zest, lemon grass and even the high, bright and unmistakeable sugary fingerprint of lemon pez. That is real lemon sugars with some flavor that comes a little closer to the HFCS variety, and lighter, airier touches of dandelion petals, too. Light and citrusy is the taste, with more lemon acidity than grapefruit acidity defining the taste, and the higher, blander sweetness of white sugar, with fewer but still noticeable chunks of dark maple syrup adding to the carousel of sweets. Overall, with the hops and sweets all roped together, this is a brew that is bright and cheery, with that distinctive Stone strength and robustness across the nose and palate.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

1185,"2014-07-02",3.5,"Whole lot of awesome hops packed into a fresh brew that isnt overly malted. However, the 9.4% abv gives it a real unnecessary booziness that takes away from the flavor. Could definitely stand to be a lower gravity beer and pack the same fresh hoppy punch.

It pours a clear yellow - copper color with a frothy and rocky white head. A thick, fluffy ring is retained along with a near solid surface coverage.

The oily slick texture is accompanied by a soft, but lightly prickly, carbonation. The medium full body finishes with a juicy citrus a pine.

1185,"2014-06-19",4.4,"THOUGHTS: Very nice and very fresh. Started off more citrus, grapefruit and pine, but it transitioned to a lot more tropical fruit as time passed and the beer warmed. The bitterness also intensified as it warmed. Hid alcohol decently for the high ABV. It was there but not unpleasant. Easy to drink. It went down easy for such a hoppy ale. Kept improving the warmer it became.
TECHNICAL: Drank Enjoy By 04-01-13 on 3/1/2013. Bottle. Poured a crystal clear, light to medium gold with an average, off-white head that kept a thin sheet and left good lacing. The aroma contained light caramel; heavy pine, resin, passion fruit, citrus and tropical fruit ( which became dominant by the end); light melon; and slight alcohol. The initial flavor was lightly sweet and moderately bitter; while the finish was moderately sweet and heavily to nearly harshly bitter with a long duration. There was caramel and then tons of hops, more and more hops as it warmed, tropical fruit, grapefruit, pineapple, pine, resinous hops, and even a little berry hops. Just all sorts of hops and lots of them all. THe medium body was oily and then dry with fizzy carbonation and a light alcoholic and slightly metallic finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

(5/5) Medium body and decent sustained carbonation, with an off-dry building bitter finish and a gentle warming. (5/5)

Dont tell me how to live my life, bottle! Even though this is ten days past the best by date, this is probably the the best Enjoy By Ive tried so far. This is pretty much the perfect DIPA - the flavours are a wonderfully balanced combination of all the best hop characteristics, with just enough sweetness to balance out the huge bitterness that comes out on the finish. And like prior vintages, the high ABV is hidden to a truly impressive degree. Literally the only thing in this brew that could be improved is the head retention and lacing, which is a pretty minor aesthetic consideration. (19/20)","CANADA","UXO"

1185,"2014-06-15",3.8,"I love the marketing concept for this stuff and it is a damn fine IIPA as well. Really, the only downside to it for hopheads is the appearance which is clear orange w/ a short lived head. And what kind of a hophead is going to be unable to look past a minor shortcoming in appearance? The nose on this is really unique. It sounds strange to describe but the hop character has an almost minty edge to it along w/ pine and peaches which I think of as being fairly standard. This is a lightly sweet beer with soft bitterness which helps the aromatics really shine in this case. The carbonation is mild and the texture is full and cottony. It finishes w/ a lingering touch of honey sweetness and some gentle resinous bitterness. This is a great IIPA and I heartily recommend it to fans of the style.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

1185,"2014-05-31",3.8,"4-20-14 Enjoy By

Appearance- fairly clear (a tad hazy), copper, orange hue. Appealing. 

Smell- excellent nose. Pine!!!! Some grass, too. Some floral notes to boot. 

Taste- big full wallop of resin (and that pine), lingers throughout. Bitter soon follows and strengthens at the end. Didnt note much of the citrus thing, unfortunately, compared to some the other reviews.

Mouthfeel- big, full, dry.

Overall- Im a sucker for Stone (love Ruination!), and easily fall prey to the ""enjoy by"" campaign, so Im a lock to try each offering. Not sure how long theyve been doing this (started last year, I think), but I really, really liked the one I had in 13. That said, Im glad I bought the 4-20-14. I ""enjoyed"" it, but wont be picking up another. A quality IPA, indeed, but not worth another round. Look forward to future offerings.

1185,"2014-04-26",4.3,"Presentation: 22 oz. brown bottle with the 05/16/14 ""Enjoy By"" date right on the label. Served in a Sam Adams pint glass.

Appearance: Perfect clear, bright, gold color. It develops a robust head that quickly goes away and leaves just a thin ring. The lacing is incredible, covering the whole glass and slowly sliding away.

Smell: Big citrus, hop aromas of pine, grapefruit and spices attack the nose. The smell is very good and very important to the overall experience. 

Taste: The citrusy grapefruit taste is right at the front along with some pine and spicy pepper notes. Theres also an alcohol sting at the end thanks to a 9.4% ABV that gets stronger and more noticeable as the beer warms.

Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Its smooth and very refreshing when cold. It only gets smoother as it warms up.

Overall: It was a big deal for Puerto Ricos craft beer scene getting this. Believe the hype, its simply incredible in every aspect. Hophead or not, you need to give this beer a try. It should be noted that in order for this beer to be enjoyed fully it should be had slowly. The taste and texture both change the warmer it gets.","San Juan, PUERTO RICO","VoodooBear"

A gorgeous golden color with a nice soft white head. Amazing flavor, complicated and simple at the same time, citrus, resin; grapefruit and sweeter? Something sweet...someone mentioned passionfruit. Perhaps. Amazing flavor, amazing experience, from the top of the bomber to the finish.

Enjoy By 10.31.14.  Bomber pour into a tulip.  Apricot brew covered in white foamy goodness. This round is another huge clock to the jawline, but this time the grapefruit is a monster, and those more subtle aromas are overpowered by a bitter, grassy resin.  The grapefruit winds around the base of my tongue with a medium body, drying my mouth and titillating my olfactories.  The experience is not unpleasant,  just obviously a different experience than the last one I had with Enjoy By.  The palate is sticky, dry and quite nice.  Cant wait to experience yet another bottling in the near future!

1185,"2014-04-17",4.3,"Bottled 1/10/14. Poured 2/3/14. I believe I paid $6.99 for the bomber.

Enjoy by 2.14.14

Appearance: Perfectly clear golden color. Two finger, slightly off-white head. Great lacing. Nice looking beer. 

Smell: Very fresh on the nose, as Id expect. The two dominant aromas I pull are pine and grapefruit. A sort of malty sweetness as well. Not exactly blowing my mind with a huge depth of interesting smells, but whats there is very nice.

Taste/feel: Quite nice. Like the smell in a lot of ways. A good bit of sweetness through most of the sip with a slight burn and bitterness on the finish. The flavor on the front is resinous, piney hops, with grapefruit and other citrus flavors meddling in the middle of the mouth, with that bit of a burn/bitterness at the end. Aftertaste is a sort of lemon zest bitterness with a caramel sweetness. I like it, but not its not blowing my socks off. Medium body. Medium carbonation, maybe a little high. Very drinkable. As the brew warms slightly, a sort of Summit hop flavor comes through (for those who dont know, a bit of an oniony flavor). It actually becomes pretty significant and it makes the brew a bit more interesting and causes it to stand out a little bit more than it otherwise would have. As it warms up even more, tropical fruit peeks through, as does the alcohol. Tastes almost like a completely different beer from when it was straight out of the fridge.

Enjoy Bys a brew Ive been wanting to get my hands on since I first heard about it. I missed out on the last batch that came to Michigan, but not this one. Grapefruit and pine dominate when its first out of the fridge, but then Summit hops (or ones similar) add a third dimension. This is a tasty one to crack open and spend an afternoon or evening with that also comes at a reasonable price. Its a beer Id recommend you seek out, but in a way, Im ALMOST disappointed? I decided to give it a 4.5 overall just because I love how the flavors change so much throughout the 22oz of beer.

1185,"2014-03-31",4.3,"Enjoy by 4/20/14. Clear light amber, golden, pour with a very nice head and long retention lacing. Nose of sweet citrus (mango, orange) over a light grapefruit and earthy dankness background. Light medium bodied with a slick texture. Normally carbonated with no effervescence on the finish. The flavor profile is a blend of hop flavors over a slight biscuit sweetness with a low level of bitterness. It begins with the sweet citrus flavors which are soon overpowered by the dank earthy hop components. While complex, the flavor is heavily ""dankcentric"" - lol. On the smooth finish, you get a bit of biscuit sweetness flowing into the dankcentric vortex coupled with a nice residual alcohol tingle at the back of the throat. An exceptional beer that those which wonder what dank means should try.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"
1185,"2014-03-30",5.0,"UPDATED: APR 12, 2014 Ive received some cool birthday presents in my life, but I cant recall receiving a gift that Ive loved as much as the green bottle that said Enjoy By 4.20.14 IPA. This is a beer that Ive wanted to have for a long-ass time. When the opportunity finally came along in the form of a belated present, I feared that it couldnt possibly live up to my expectations. Man, was I wrong. The first whiff of piney and citrusy hops was enough to make me fall in love. But I was just getting started. My tasting of Enjoy By IPA revealed woodsiness, grapefruit tartness, and a HUGE peppery spice. True to the West Coast fashion, Stone makes some aggressively-hopped ales. Enjoy By IPA has every bit of that manic power, yet, its smooth and reserved in a way that I couldnt have imagined. Dank and potent - yes. However, this beer isnt the least bit punishing. Its an amazing experience to have a beer thats been brewed to be enjoyed fresh. Thanks to the 4.20,14 release of this beer, Ill have another date to remember: 3.31.14. At this point in time, Enjoy By IPA is my favorite beer.","Lincoln, Nebraska, USA","MetalNHopHead"

Enjoy by 4-20-14 does not disappoint. Very long finish, especially along the sides & tip of my tongue. Aromatic piney resin aroma immediately on cracking open the bomber; for some reason it took me back to fall of 1969 in Austin Texas (a lifetime ago) and walking into a basement apartment somewhere near 38 & 1/2 St, meeting this giant gnome sitting atop dozens of bricks of pot. ""Wanna smoke some dope?"" said the caterpillar man. Made a definite impression. As I said a lifetime ago; also reminds me of an evening around the spring of 1968 passing through a frat party (?) where the 13th Floor Elevators were playing.

9.4% ABV

APPEARANCE: Poured a brilliant warm honey color, with a pillowy off white head. Head dissipated fairly quickly leaving nice lacing patterns. 

AROMA: If a grapefruit and a pine tree had a baby it's skin would smell like this! Lots of tropical fruits, mango, pineapple, guava. Sweet malts and a bit of herbal slices come through. 

TASTE: followed the nose incredibly well. Fruit comes out very nicely followed with sweet maltiness and then the hops hit you. They hit hard and in your face. Bitterness is very present but begins to mellow in a great biscuity flavor on the backend. 

MOUTHFEEL: medium plus on the carbonation, prickly and tingly in the tongue. Slightly oily with a medium body. This is almost to easy to drink. 

OVERALL: I myself am a big fan of Stone, this IPA gave me everything I look for in a solid west coast outing. Delicious grapefruit & pine bomb with high ABV and high IBU that is easy drinking.

1185,"2014-02-13",4.8,"Enjoy by 2/14/14. Bomber poured into Spiegelau IPA glass. Enticing full aroma of citrus, mango, and banana. Light orange color. Medium off-white head that lingers. Taste of citrus, a hint of pine, and resinous hops. Little to no alcohol on the finish. Full, smooth palate with only a touch of bitterness.

An amazing IPA that I feel lucky to have enjoyed.

1185,"2014-02-13",4.1,"Bottle of 2-14-14. Pours orange and gold with a very tight perfect off-white head. The aroma is grapefruit, pine, and tropical citrus fruits (pineapple, mango). The taste follows the aroma in layers. Medium crisp mouthfeel, smooth but just enough bite, signature stone. I love this series. This one is heavy on the tropical fruit all around. Awesome.

Flavor holds some crushed orange flavored vitamins, caramel covered orange peel, booze heat, grapefruit and pine.

Very strong, superb, highly appetizing aroma features peach, pine, cat urine (not in a bad way), rhubarb, raspberry, peaches and cream, and apricot scents. A bit vegetal and fruity/floral in the smell. Complex, strong, and wonderful aroma. One of the best smelling beers Ive ever encountered. Pours a clear, deep gold, the slightest bit orange. A ruby or copper hue. Shiny liquid. Small amount of beige head. Very appealing look. A little more interesting head would have earned the appearance a 5. Dry, hoppy taste features pine, lemon, lemon peel, orange, and apricot flavor elements. A sweet, creamy, sugary undertone. Shortbread cookie. A touch of alcohol in the taste. Spicy and bitingly dry finish. If I have any criticism of the flavor, it is that the beer may be a little too flavorful, if that is possible. Medium to heavy body. Crisp, quite lively, and a bit oily (in a good way) in the palate. Filling yet drinkable. Long, dry aftetaste that could stand to be even stronger. Superb palate effects. Stone Enjoy By 02.14.14 is a GREAT beer, one of the best I have ever had. I cant ask for much better than this. I am blown away. It really is awesome. I would buy a case if I could somehow preserve the flavor. I had high hopes, and this beer just trounced them. It is a brilliant and beautiful beer.

Rich hop aroma, sweet and floral, very floral, with touches of dankness, resin, pine, and grapefruit zest. Surprisingly sweet flavor, malt definitely coming through, some sweet caramel and doughiness, mild balancing hop bitterness definitely shows up, but could use more in my book to help cut the sweet. The hop character accentuates the sweetness in many ways. Some juicy fruit aspects (literally, not the chewing gum), with orange and grapefruit popping out as well as earthy, green hops, pine, more floral and sweet aspects.

This might be one of the best Stone beers to date for one reason - you never have to wonder how old the bottle youve purchased is no matter which store it was purchased at. Couple that with world class contents and an affordable price point and you might just have one of the best IPAs commercially available through most of the United States.

Aroma / Appearance - A bronze base glows as it absorbs the crisp white head. Resin, spruce, and the nose of a typical Stone IPA brighten the air like the smell of polished hardwood floors left to dry overnight.

Flavor / Palate - Lemons, orange slices, and spruce tickle the tongue and back of the throat. It slowly warms the throat after a few sips until it finishes strong. This is not a superaggressive imperial IPA by extreme standards. That makes it all the more better - you wont feel burned out after a glass or two. Id recommend everyone try this once.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1185,"2013-11-09",2.7,"Bomber via Lubiere (merci!), served cool in a tulip glass. 09-13-13 vintage.
App.: Hazy deep golden with a small white head.
 
Aroma: Strong dank, citrusy, cat pee hops, a bit of eucalyptus, green tea, minimal malt contribution, evolves into pine and green peppercorns, still seems fairly fresh, not really for me.
 
Palate: Medium+ body, fairly aggressive carbonation.
 
Flav.: Quite peppery, piney, some citrus, some cat pee, still some eucalyptus/medicinal herb, a little touch of malt character; sweet with big bitterness and a fairly long, pine/cat pee finish.

1185,"2013-10-09",4.7,"Enjoy by 11/12/13, purchased in Cincinatti, OH on first day of availability. Bottled 10/04/13 so 5 days ago. Nose on chilled freshly poured beer was pure dankness which I associate to simcoe based on some of my single hop simcoe homebrew experiments. As the beer warms the aromas explode open, I get orange peel, mango, grapefruit and pine resin, words cannot describe how amazing it smells. Taste is creamy, smooth, I get some slight alcohol on the finish but hidden very well for 9.4%. Beautiful light orange color. Light on IBUs, was expecting something closer to ruination at 100+, this seems less. 

For me this beer is all about the nose at the bottom of the glass as it has warmed, absolutely divine. Excellent beer, very happy I was able to buy an entire case of it!","BELGIUM","jdebonth"

1185,"2013-10-01",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2013 Enjoy by 10-25-13: This is not a delicate, refined or particularly academic DIPA. It is a raucous romp into hop domination. There is a nice base of malt but the hops are not restrained or balanced by this aspect. The hops are complex but the most interesting component is the dank of muscadine. In wine this flavor is called foxy and is not so highly esteemed. It is more appealing in beer, almost as much as in muscadine jelly. Ive had previous batches of this series, but this is the best yet. 

Enjoy By 12-13-13 This just keeps getting better.  Malt is still very strong but hops get the edge.  The balance between hop flavors and malt sweetness is deeper and more complex as hops seem a touch more expressive in this iteration.  I have been interested, now Im hooked.","","Lupulucid"

Pours a clear yellow, amber. Brilliant and has a fast falling head of white foam that leaves loose bubbles and a ring and cap . Film on top and great lace. 

Nose is pineapple and sweet from the ripe fruit. Dry pine needles and some grapefruit to be tart and to tease you a little. Omy. Theres not a lot of malt on the nose but what there is smells earthy and breaddy. Not too sweet just a breath of honey. Like if I leaned in close and then whispered the word ""sweet."" The real sweetness on this nose is from fruits and that excites. The hops are succulent even on the nose and floral. 

The taste is out of this world. Malt is lightly breaddy and flows like silk under the sweetness of the fruit. It doesnt offer too much and stays just behind the pine needles and the pineapple. Theres a little orange that comes forward as it warms. This beer is perfectly balanced and theres a nice dry bitter. Not loud, not tremendous, just right. The hops are plump and floral on the palate and juicy in and of themselves. If thats even possible. This has a fluffy malt character that is light as a feather and then theres resin and oil and pungent spice but not too awful much. Just enough. 

This beer is the reason you drink an IPA. Its bountiful in its hop character. Its decadent in its fruit sweetness. Its malt is superb and flows underneath it all to lead you to a spectacular bitter. Its pronounced but its not egregious. Its not heavy, its light. the mouthfeel is something you dont even think about until you are lost in the aftertaste. So glad I tired this. One of the best beers I have had this year.","New York, USA","pinkie"

A- it pours a crystal clear gold with a close to a 1 finger head of foam that seems to be shrinking slowly, leaving some lacing behind.

S- the aromas oozed out of the bottle when I popped the cap. Hoppy as all get out. Big grapefruit, decidedly bitter to the nth degree. Reminds me of a certain ""triple"" IPA, which shall remain nameless, that went above and beyond my comfort zone. This smells very oily with the hop presence..

T- laws yes..err...no. Its not at all like the other brew I didnt mention by name. Well, they are both VERY hoppy and bitter but this has an oily/fresh hop flavour that kills it. Light on the malt but not that light. Mid palate is where I notice it the most...a kind of earthy malt presence. 

The rest is all the best of what hops can bring to the table and I ""should"" know. I have had some of the best thanks to online orders, TRADES, and what I can find off the shelf locally.

1185,"2013-08-24",5.0,"A beer, I have been wanting to try...that doesn't come along so much anymore. I'm not saying it's hyped up but I love fresh IPA. The concept was something I fell in love with the date is 8/24/13 the bottle says to drink by 9/13/13. Look it's expressive in appearance, copper bright body almost an orange layered hue to the beer with cream almost white head forms thick. Fine speckled lacing I'm again in love, why does this have to be the beer, one which sells out quicker than stores can get it in. Aroma has bright grapefruit, citrus notes that expel any notion of less than fresh hops. It's actually an explosion of hops withheld in a room of fresh hops, earthy qualities are dumbed down by bright citrus. Each gulp goes down smoother than the next, beautiful beer I'm drinking each sip thinking where is the next drink coming from that's a strong hook that radio DJs look for in every overproduced song on the market. This is not overproduced it's just the best quality beer of every quality IPA you have ever tried. Slick oily mouthfeel leads to expressive carbonation levels soft and excellent between every twist and turn get me a case and I will drink it.

Poured a golden blonde liquid and was accompanied by an average sizing of white foam head. Aroma is completely dominated by fresh oily green hops that smell organically earthy of fruits and vegetables yet also musty. The flavor is even more vibrant than my nose led me to believe because of an intense level of bitterness that comes from some seriously oily hops.

This is quickly followed by a devastatingly bitter, tongue numbing bitterness with a delicious combination of grass, pine and grapefruit (all the greatest hits!). This is countered by a caramel malt sweetness that helps mellow the hops just enough to keep it from becoming ridiculous. That balance of sweet and bitter sticks to the tongue through the finish. I did miss my perfect window of 7/4/2013, but I cant imagine this being any better than it is.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"

Crystal clear light copper coloured body with a bit of gold noticeable and a thick, rich two centimtere tall off-white head. Aroma of fresh piney and grapefruity hops with tons of resin, alcohol and white grape notes. Full-bodied; Deep resinous, piney, bitter and assertive metallic note with a lighter malt backbone than expected, but way too much bitterness and alcohol notes. Aftertaste shows more pine sol cleanser than anything else and some decent flavours - but way too strong and not like a good IPA nor Imperial IPA at all.

1185,"2013-06-18",5.0,"UPDATED: JUN 26, 2013 What can I say?

Perfect Pilsner-like color* For those who would argue that it should be more appropriately copper colored...

*The first officially designated American craft brewed IPA was Grants, and it contained Pilsener malts of this golden hue.

The nose is an exquisite melange of  grapefruit, Mandarin orange, tangerine, pineapple, mango, peach, melon, kiwi, and lemon/lime.

The flavors follow suit, and the body is medium to full with just the right amount of malt backbone which is more of a textural thing, in this case, than a flavor enhancer. The hops are given free reign to truly shine here.

The balance is nearly flawless, right through the long, dry finish which is crisp, and remarkably refreshing.

Palate is perfect, not too heavy for this big beer and it feels much more quaff-abale than one would imagine. Overall, this was amazing when it was fresh. Probably 4.5+ especially on draft. It has faded just a little but what put me off the most was the very sharp bitter flavor, but even then it was still super drinkable.

1185,"2013-04-30",4.3,"Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip.

Enjoy By IPA pours a soft golden amber color.  It is quite transparent, with visible carbonation rising up from the bottom of my glass into a robust off-white cap.  This exhibits great head retention and leaves a few spiderwebs of lace down the sides of the glass.

The aroma is the strongest aspect of this beer.  Sweet and juicy mango and tropical fruit hop notes waft out of the glass first, with some candied grapefruit, dank, and pine notes coming through as well.

Even without seeing the label, it would be easy to tell that this is a Stone beer.  Brazenly hopped, there is still a great transition from sweet to hoppy, which is a progression that separates the best IPAs from the rest.  A bit of honey and caramel lead nicely into the caramelized grapefruit hop notes, with tons of mango, peach, apricot, pine, and herbal hop flavors as well.  The finish is bitter, but the flavors help to grow the bitterness over the course of the sip.

Stone also brews its beers with an understanding of keeping the ABV, flavor, and body all in line, and this is no exception.  A high ABV by IPA standards, the flavor really masks any suggestion of booziness, and the smooth body and creamy carbonation work to keep each sip fresh.  

With a robust addition of hops across a wide range of flavors, this is a great addition to the Stone family.  I also appreciate their effort to encourage hoppy beers to be labeled fresh for immediate consumption.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

Flavor profile is extremely hop-focused also, with more fresh pine, lemongrass, grapefruit, spice/pepper, herbal tones, even a touch of garlic, which is there, but mostly overridden by the blend of other flavors so it wasnt too offensive.

1185,"2013-04-17",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 28, 2016 7.4.16 batch.  This is consistently great beer.  Amazing appearance.  Stinging, raw, bold in both aroma and taste.  Guaranteed fresh.  Its not perfect, but its really good, and Ill settle for that.  
12.25.15 batch.  More fine-tuning.  This is great stuff.  I thought about a -1 overall, but I think its just because Im more familiar with it in 6-packs now that it doesnt blow my mind each time.  However, with how close this is to 10% and with no indication whatsoever, I cant knock it down.
7.4.15 batch, 8 days since bottling.  Still super good.  Aroma is dank and spicy with just the right touch of malt.  Big green bitterness.  Very nice!   +1 overall
2.14.15 batch, 6 days since bottling.  Just checking in.  This is still outstanding.  Sometimes edging on green and oniony, but if I see that flavor as part of a greater fresh bitterness, it puts it in the right light.  Only $6.99 a bomber these days.
7.04.14 batch, straight off the delivery truck, bottled just 6 days ago.  More of the same - lasting head, perfect lacing, fresh, raw, green, and dank in all aspects.  Truthfully, its a pretty intense flavor, yet inexplicably it retains a ton of drinkability.  Couldnt drink this every day, but a couple times a year its a fun experience.  
4.20.14 batch, bottled 13 days ago.  Pours a perfectly clear light amber with a foamy white head that lasts forever and leaves great lacing.  Aroma is dank and juicy with grass and pine resin.  This one is fresh and green, but not too raw at all if youre prepared for it.  Slight tomato vine in the aroma and taste, adding to the green vibe going on.  Perfect for what it sets out to accomplish.  +1 aroma.  This has been a consistently solid beer.   Sweet malts in the end keep it from getting too crazy.  Just a touch of alcohol to remind you this is a serious beer.  That said, if I was forced to chug a ~10%, this would be the one.  Easy drinking.   Super good.  10+5+9+4+17 = 4.6

9.13.13 batch, bottled 8 days ago.  Not sure what I was thinking calling this ""crazy high priced"" last time, since all of the Stone Imperial 22oz bottles are $9.99.  Aroma is super good with fresh piney and grassy hops exploding from the glass.  Taste is raw, green, dank, and resiny with pine and rind.  It will seem too raw at first, but it grows on you by the end of the bottle, and the tastes meld well together, with a good aftertaste.  Alcohol well-hidden and sneaky. 10+4+9+4+18=4.5

5.17.13 Batch - Pours much lighter than expected, a very pale light gold redeemed by lasting bubbles and great lacing.  Aroma is out of this world - fresh signature Stone hops with grapefruit and other citrus.  Taste is bitter from start to finish, with a slight reprieve as some malt comes through in the aftertaste.  No evidence of the ABV apart from a little warming.  Im glad to have tried this hyped beer, and overall its very good.  I bought this the day it arrived in MN, just 5 days after bottling.  Still, with how hard it will be to find in the future, and the crazy high price ($9.99 for a bomber), Ill be able to find better for less.  10+4+8+4+17=4.3","Minnesota, USA","Ericular"
1185,"2013-04-17",3.9,"UPDATED: APR 24, 2013 5.17.13 batch #MN. The first thing that I found to really love about this beer is the aroma. Mainly grapefruit with some other stone fruits in the background (lemon, & orange). Appearance is much lighter than I expected, goldenrod or pee is the best descriptor. Taste is were this goes downhill.... A lot of the normal IPA flavors and a heaping of straight bitterness. I dont actually find this balanced. It is bitter heavy. Many Minneapolis IPAs are better. Not really sure why the hype (oh wait, its an Apple mentality.) Palate is more thin that I like with a DIPA. It is missing a viscous feel. Overall, I can get much better cans of Furious, bottles of Saga, and Growlers of any local IPA that I would buy again before this. It is scary easy to drink though.... #enjoynomore

Absolutely wonderful taste. Mouthfeel is light. Gentle carbonation. Long-lasting hop finish. No booziness. This is an excellent DIPA.

Honestly to see all the hype I am disappointed in this beer. Dont get me wrong this is def a good beer, but Im not buying into this brewed to be extra fresh crap. The beer pours average, no exciting appearance, nothing special with the head. The aroma is quite unique though. It has the basics of a West Coast IPA but more, there seems to be tons of varieties of hops, very complex. This strong hop flavor makes you forget its over 9% abv. Although I appreciate all these hops, I feel like they could have been chosen differently to better compliment each other. All in all my opinion breaks down to this. Every other type of IPA I have had from Stone Brewing has been better than this beer, and they are all half the price. I was super excited to try this been and unfortunately I was disappointed. Save your money and buy the original Stone IPA, it is the better way to go.","","vicg12"

The taste is a deluge of complex hop flavors coating the tongue with sweet and bitter, fruity, orangey flavors. The different hop characters range from lightly citrusy, to understated piney notes, and evolve to a dark, ever-so-slightly funky barnyard earthiness. Incredible drinkability for an IIPA, with a lightly medium palate that seemingly only Stone has perfected. The liquid finishes with a sweet, delicate dryness that creates an almost dessert-like satisfaction in the mouth. The big 9.4% abv is absolutely undetectable on the palate, but evident in the head.

1185,"2013-03-23",4.6,"04.01.13 This is totally awesome. Big thanks to Rich who brought this over from California/Bay Area and thanks to Josh JLizard for hooking us all up together to share in these beery delights. This is such a treat for my UK palate, to be able to taste such a fresh IPA. This beer totally sings with hop goodness. No doubt many of you raters are from the US so are used to fresh if not super fresh IPAs but at best we here in the UK consider a month old as fresh what with lead times on orders etc. Anyhow, to Hoppopotamus in Santa Cruz, (no offence meant) but this beer is anything but nondescript in terms of Hop Aroma. The 04.01.13 stinks of quite possibly the most uniquely perfumed hop out there: Sorachi Ace. The tell tale signs are the waxy, jasmine and citrus notes you get. This may very well and most likely is a very well blended hop-bill, but Sorachi takes the lead as it tends to, as it has such a dominant aroma/flavour. Behind that there are classic aromas of sticky resin, lemon zest, lime skin, and rubber (in a good way) the faintest trace of cereal and honey and caramel. Flavour hits you with a bang, citrus flavours to the fore remind me of a combo of Sorachi and Centennial with huge waxy notes, giant citrus fruit, ripe lemons, ripe pink grapefruit, hints of mango sweetness - at once tropical but resinous, sweet but savoury. Grapefruit rind and lemon peel take you to the finish with herbal nuances, more jasmine tea and a wonderful creamy yet prickly mouth feel which keeps the beer lively and  hides the alcohol in masterful way. A real pleasure to drink. Eaten with home made Fajitas, Home made Guacamole & Habanero Hot Sauce. A real delight all round.","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"

1185,"2013-03-22",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2013 Bomber. Enjoy By 04.20.13. Drank on 3.22.13.  Thanks to Enoteca in Post Falls, ID for setting this aside! Pours a clear old gold with a long-sustaining off-white head with great retention; after it recedes, it leaves sheeting lace and a constant skiff of foam. Aroma is full of hallmark IPA notes: first off comes the catbox, then pine, then grapefruit--classic; Im also getting some not-as-common, but always welcome peach. Taste is bittersweet with lots of citrusy notes followed by pine; I also get some bready malt after it warms up a bit. What I taste is an IPA that still has its hop credentials firmly intact before the natural malt invasion that occurs with age inevitably takes place. This is a pure hop vehicle, the malt present but restrained. Too many times with this style, the malt overtakes the hops, due in most cases to age, leaving behind only a shadow of the original beers true potential. That isnt the case with Stones freshest of fresh hop ales. Hopheads have a nice beer to savor here. 4-20, the holiday celebrating Humulus lupulus cousin cannabis--this cant be a coincidence, considering this is one of the dankest beers Ive ever had.

Another fun Enjoy By date for the KC metro, definitely the eldest Enjoy By Ive cracked open, a big sweet tropical fruit layer welcomes me from ripping the cap to the initial nose in my TeKu, pineapple, pine, and white grape quickly steal the show with the same trend cascading into the flavor experience, to me what really sticks out on this batch versus the last two Ive consumed is how much more the alcohol is hidden and how much less sticky the palate is, a bit of a dank characteristic comes into play as this one warms into the lower 50s, very quaffable, clean and nicely refreshing, this batch seems most similar to the 12/21/12

1185,"2013-03-13",3.3,"Reviewed 3/10/13. 22 oz bottle into a Duvel tulip.

A: Pours a freaking gorgeous golden amber shade with perfect clarity. The head is a three finger white shade. Everything is good here - retention, texture, and the lacing down the glass. This beer makes Sofia Vergara look like a damn horse in comparison.

S: There is a distinct savory note from the hops that reminds me of onion/garlic. Otherwise, this one comes off as being bitter just from the nose alone; there is a lot of grapefruit peel, black pepper, mango, papaya, pine, and guava. It really smells damn great, but perhaps its not quite to my preference for an IPA.

T: At first, theres some slight maltiness (in an earthy expression) before it finishes both dry and bitter. Transitioning between the vaguely citrusy opening and piny, bitter ending is a strong midtaste of onion and garlic; I actually like this portion of the flavor profile the best. But the biggest problem here is how boozy this one seems. Maybe its some of the earthy and oniony qualities coming through on the back end, but theres a real distinct sharp heat to it that doesnt strike me as being hop-derived. Certainly it feels every bit its 9.4% ABV. To be fair, this note helps to rein in the bitterness somewhat, so its not all bad, I guess.

Ive got another one on standby that I plan to serve more chilled than this one - maybe this will tone down the booze some? Regardless, what a letdown.

M: Typical Stone IPA: bone-dry, clean, astringent, and bitter as fuck. Well, maybe not as fuck, but it does have a good lingering bite to it. Something like this should be spectacularly drinkable - thanks to all the poorly concealed alcohol I taste here, Im reduced to vegging over this one for a moderate length of time. Drinkability is actually okay because the general feel is quite good - but then again, I expected something fantastically chuggable.

O: I really thought this was going to be a world-class DIPA, but instead I find it kind of harsh and meh. I hate to say it, but this has nothing on some of the local DIPAs I can get fairly readily (Evolution Lot 6 DIPA and Troegs Perpetual IPA); and lets not talk about how badly Lagunitas Sucks pounds this one into submission. Absolutely worth trying, though - hell, I seem to be only one who doesnt love this. But Stone, unless the second bottle I drink manages to make me shit out rainbows and sunshine the way I expected this one to, you are back on my naughty list again.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

1185,"2013-03-10",4.5,"4.01.13. Finally man-handling a bottle solo so I can provide a proper review. 22 oz bomber into a thin tulip glass. Reviewed on 3/07/2013.

A - Crazy clear beer. Like ""the bottle looks like its filled with water"" clear. Beautiful golden amber body with some rising carbonation. Two to three fingers worth of fluffy off white foam which settles down quickly leaving behind some serious lacing with retention that will outlast the beer. Even swirling this beer is sexy as tons of rapid carbonation floods the surface of the beer right below the head. Im a sucker for unfiltered IPAs, but this is hands down the best looking filtered IPA I have ever seen. 

S - The hop bill is pretty insane and its very apparent. This is just a cluster fuck of hops varieties. Grapefruit, orange juice, pine, danky dank, peaches and a slight hint of savory onions. There really is a lot happening here, but the beauty of the beer is how damn fresh it is and each hop is in its glory here.

T - Despite an unbelievably complex and busy nose, the taste is actually rather straight forward. Bitter and juicy grapefruit, peaches, and a dash of pine. Very bitter finish with a light onion savoriness on the very tippy end. The bitterness does seem to wipe everything away and mute flavors out.

M - Thick and creamy with perfect carbonation. 

O - A pretty impressive and damn near perfect IPA with a wide array of hops on display. I love the idea behind the beer, I love how deadly serious Stone is about it, and I love that nose and flavor. Ill be salivating for each batch and I hope CT gets it again. I will say that I was a bit less impressed when having it on tap though.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

Poured into a pint glass out of a 22oz bomber.

Pours a clear light gold with just a tiny white head that quickly fades to a thin cap. Just a few chunks of lacing cling to the sides of the glass.

The aroma has a very pungent, almost oniony thing going on combined with some pine sap and a touch of tropical fruit. No malt to speak of as it is all hops here and they prove to be very mouth watering.

Lots of orange and pine in the flavor with just a touch of butterscotch. More earth and sap coming in towards the middle along with some tartness. There is a brief sweetness that appears but is then quickly ushered away by an extreme drying bitterness. Mouthfeel is somewhat silky but then finishes very dry which is impressive for a beer of this strength. Alcohol is completely hidden making this dangerously drinkable.

It is the 4/1/13 edition, in stock for one week only supposedly. Aroma of sharp bitter citrus peels, and yes the strength comes through in the nose. Has the yellow color of a nice lager. Wow, there is not going to be any malt in this one. Intense bitter citrus flavor, and the hops are so fresh that they maintain there own sweetness, which is good because theres nothing else here. So light its oddly drinkable, but will certainly cause some digestive issues later.

Pours a lighter golden orange with a slight haze. Moderate head and not all that impressive lacing. Still looks like I want to put it in my belly, though. Nose of orange, tangerine, grapefruit--fruit and rind. Pineapple and mango notes as well as a piney resin thing, almost slightly peppery. Those notes on the nose come out as an impressive bitterness on the tongue. A step slightly over the line for me in terms of bitterness... geez, never thought Id say I wish an IPA had a bit more malt balance. Anyway, still superb and quite lovely.

Appearance: Large, foamy white head.  Totally transparent medium gold.  Lots of visible carbonation.

Aroma: Tons of grapefruit augmented by melon, tangerine smells.  Juicy hop presence.  This is probably the single best smelling beer Ive ever encountered.

Taste: Piney, resiny hops up front that mellows to those juicy citrus hop notes (grapefruit, tangerine, some apricot) in the finish.  Not much in the name of malt presence to balance those hops out; this is definitely a hops only beer on my palate.  

Mouthfeel: Slight alcohol presence, very smooth feel in the mouth similar to a lower alcohol IPA (like a DFH 60 minute); this is a beer that could get me in trouble, for sure. Gets a little bit sticky as it warms up. 

Overall: This is a very tasty IPA, but I cant agree with the 100/A+ rating that Ive seen it getting online.  Id love to do a side-by-side comparison with regular Stone IPA or Ruination to see how it stands up.  My score is definitely influenced by the hype factor (negatively).  Its a great IPA, but it doesnt warrant the absolute fervor that surrounds it.

And my search has paid dividends in profound hoppiness. The second the cap comes off its hop intensity even a foot away from my nose. Loads of dank goodness onslaught my olfacroties. It has been ages since Ive experienced this. The flavor is a mouthful of hops with perfectly inoffensive malts serving merely as a canvas. The depth of the herbs, citrus is insane. 
Beautiful.

Another bomber of the Enjoy By 4-01-13. Let me tell you something, I love how Stone has overcome the foolishness of the Vertical Epic by embracing their true strength: fresh hoppy beers. Making a date stamp the literal title of this beer and prominently, boldly displaying it on the front of the bottle is a gimmick that I absolutely love. Stone has the IIPA prowess to back it up. SO much hop intensity is dripping off this beer. Endless dank herbal bite with a wash of citrus to back it up. Best hop showcase Ive had in a great while. I love it.

[Tap at Freshcraft of the 04.20.14]

Yep. This stuff is a fantastic showcase of hops. Its herbal, piney, citrusy. just all over the place. The body is pretty heavy and there is apparent malty sweetness that peeks out. I dont seem to recall noticing the malt or alcohol ""this much"" before. Thats not to say its in the way of the hop onslaught. Great IIPA.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

1185,"2013-03-04",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 20, 2013 Was lucky enough to have a faithful friend put one aside for me - this was the 4/1/13 version, 22 oz. 
Ive had most of the best double IPAs around, so my expectations were quite high. Not sure I like the sense of urgency marketing scheme, so hopefully that didnt affect my impressions. But they are:
Very good beer, all told. But not in my top five DIPAs. 
The color was a burnt amber, more akin to the Six Point Resin, so that is a plus. Carbonation and head were frothy and decent, but not as much so as the topper. The aroma was probably this beers best feature, nice development as it warmed up. The mouthfeel, medium, I could have used just a bit more froth. Taste was really crisp, nice flavor burst, but a tightly controlled balance, quite drier than I expected. 
Again, aside from marketing and cost, a very good beer, but at some point those factors have to be considered.
Hop Crisis, Topper, Resin, all better - even the Dogfish 90 is better and thats been largely unchanged for quite a while. 
If you can get one, great, you wont be disappointed - if not, dont buy into the hype. Theres bigger and better fish in the sea. 

4/20/13
This time for the 5/17/13 model.
Im not changing my numerical scores - but just add a quick note on this version. 
Another kingly gift from a friend. In my review of the 4/1/13 I was too ashamed to admit that I was visiting the cape and didnt have proper glassware - had to drink from a highball...
So this time Im at home and have dumped the contents into a nice tulip chalice. The carbonation is sluggish, a bit like a light snow in reverse. Color as noted above. Juicy lacing, with a couple of swishes it retains about a half cm on the surface with plenty of suds clinging to the sides above. Nose is again unreal for a hop fan, mouthfeel medium/heavy, but for my money the taste this time is a tad sweeter. I have to say this one wins out for me.","Deerfield, Massachusetts, USA","Belgian22"

Aroma is full of fruity hops. Grapefruit, orange, tangerine and lemon as well as tropical fruit, a bit of stone fruit and a touch of grape. Some light cracker notes and a hint of alcohol round out the aroma. 
Pours a very clear gold with a hint of copper with a thin white head that persists for a very long time. Small legs with some moderate lacing. 
Flavor is dominated by hops as well but there is a light cracker and biscuit background throughout thy even shows itself late palate. It is a very bitter beer but the bitterness is clean and not too astringent. The hop flavor is much more grapefruit forward with some hop resin in the finish. The tropical and stone fruit is still there but in smaller quantities. Finishes very dry with some alcohol spice. You can definitely taste the alcohol in the finish but it is clean. 
Mouthfeel is medium to medium light bodied with medium carbonation. Astringency is low but present and the alcohol warmth is moderate. 
Overall this is a very nice, fresh, dry IPA with a ton of hip character. I could nitpick the hop selection but it's refreshing for something to not be dominated by Citra. The hop character is a bit muddled though and I think I would prefer the flavor to be a bit fruitier. I like the light malt character and its ability to show without interfering.

1185,"2013-02-27",4.9,"On  tap at the daily growler in Upper Arlington Ohio.  Ive been away from here for quite a while now and in that time Ive become quite the hophead..  Ive tried lots of hoppy beers but this one made me come back and rate it.  And I must seriously say this is the closest thing to the perfect IPA that Ive had yet.  Beautiful Floral and Pine aroma blasts right out of the tulip glass that I chose to pour this into.  The color shows no haze a perfect amber with a good amount of carbonation rising to the top but not too much like some IPAs this one leaves an almost oily feel on your tongue.  I dont know how anyone finds alcohol in this one.  I would never believe this is almost 10% alcohol as it is beautifully balanced.  Silky smooth on the tongue with a nice dry finish yet that lingering sweetness from the malts clings as well.  This beer really is incredible and I am very very happy that I got to try it tonight...   Not only that but i have 64 oz of it to enjoy!!!  If you can get this beer I highly recommend you give it a try!","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"
1185,"2013-02-26",3.8,"A: A orange cop perish color. Half an inch head, with not much retention and what appears to be minimal lacing. 

S: Hop and citrus notes come first. Grapefruit and orange peel. A very sweet malty smell in the end. 

T: Hop notes are very strong up front, hops over power the citrus notes, which are hard to taste. Somewhat bitter in the end with some maltiness to it. 

M: A little bitter at first, but slowly subdues. Goes down pretty smooth. Not very heavy. 

O: Not a bad beer, but I enjoyed it more two months ago. Guess I should've enjoyed it by 12/21/12. Still enjoyed the hops and the great aroma.

Clear bright slight orange tint golden with 1 finger head on pour that falls rather quick to a ring and flabby bubbles.  Papaya, tropical/fruit punch hops, piney, as it warms, more garlic and green onion start to come out.  Crackery pale malt in there too, but this is a massive oily in your face hop nose.  The hop flavor is a bit more balanced/cohesive on the palate, but doesnt really fit what I like in a hop profile.

This drinks with a burning alpha acid character, nothing but pure slippery hops in their assault on my palate.

That being said, I was able to enjoy this on tap immediately after it went live. Both late summer and fall, as soon as the distributer delivered it. 
It was fucking delicious. Maybe I fell for the whole gimmick? I mean, come on... you gotta admit it was an advertising ploy.

1185,"2013-02-02",4.0,"A vigorous pour into my New Belgium globe glass produces a two-finger thick, pale, just tan head. The beer is a pale copper color that shows a brilliantly clear, rich, concentrated gold hue when held up to the light. As I pour this I get a vibrant aromatic note of mango and lychee. A deeper inspection of the nose yields notes of definite lychee, guava, a slightly metallic hop note, some dank herbal notes that lean toward hemp-oils, aromatic grainy smelling brown pepper, this last has a dried herbal, not quite woody, herbal edge to it that is almost savory in character.

Dominantly hoppy up front, the beer has a perceived sweetness from the ample, fruity hop character, but this dries out substantially into the spicy, hop driven and bitter finish. Flavors of bright lychee, kumquat, guava, bright tangelo zest, and a dank, herbaceous, almost woody hop character that gets very pepper in the finish. The beer has a biting bitterness that is not overly sharp, especially for an IPA; this last is of course relative to todays over-hopped IPAs. Woody, almost cedar like, hop notes add to the dankness and there is just a touch of garlic-chive like character, and a touch of a metallic like note. The body is nice and light, yet has some texture and weight to it; enough to carry the hops, but not so much as to keep this from being quaffable.

Quite a nice IPA, vibrantly fresh, fruity, herbal, tasty and one of the best IPAs from Stone yet. I really like the balance between the expressive fruit character and the peppery, herbaceous character.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

The flavors in the aroma follow through to the beer.  The aftertaste has a bitterness which is best described as the altoid peppermint bitterness.  I have never experienced a bitterness like that in the aftertaste.  It just lingers on the palate.  The bitterness is in perfect balance with the backbone of the beer.  It finishes nice and dry.  The alcohol is completely masked.  I really enjoyed this one.  Probably one of the best if not the best beer I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying.  Stone:  Keep making beer like this and you will reign supreme!

Bottle on 01/18/13, bottled on date is 01/11/13
First off, this bottle came into Flagstaff, AZ, where I had it, exactly 7 days after the bottles on date. That is no small feat when it comes to getting fresh beer in Flag. So, good for Stone and their distributors. I want to see more of that kind of dedication to freshness.

Pours a clean, clear, light gold color with a small ring of head. Might have been nice if this had had a little more head. Nose is fresh pine with some floral notes and a hint of mango. The taste has a lightly stanky pine bite to it that bursts with sweet, fresh floral and tropical fruit flavors. Sticky pine resin lingers on the tongue for a but afterwards. This beer reminds me a lot of a toned down Ruination Tenth Anniversary. It's almost like they squeezed all of the best aspects of that beer into a more quaffable package. It's nowhere near as stanky as Tenth was either which, in this case, is nice as it allows some of the subtler flavors to shine.","Flagstaff, Arizona, USA","AlexChillton"
1185,"2013-01-18",4.0,"Pours a fully transparent light orange with a thin head and nice lacing.  Aroma is, of course, dominated by hops, and I am picking up heavy tropical fruit and pine up front.  Flavor brings more bitterness, especially upfront, with a bit of booze.  Hops are abundant and hit a variety of notes - pine, tropical fruit, a little citrus, a bit of caramel malt underneath.  Finishes quite bitter and a just a bit harsh, which lowers the score on this otherwise highly enjoyable DIPA.  Definitely something for hop lovers to try if they can.","Seattle, Washington, USA","crackedmachine"

Aroma is loaded with earthy, piney, citrusy, danky, hops, but there is some caramel malt layered in there. 
Flavor is all about the hops. Floral shows up first, then come earth and pine fighting for dominance, then the citrusy goodness I love so much hanging around with some pepper waiting for the finish. Sweet caramel malt is there to provide balance.High ABV is hidden well, just a little heat evident after the beer has warmed.","Chandler, Arizona, USA","Padron4KM"

A big, bold, hop blend aroma fills the nostrils along with heavy floral notes and some citrus and slight tropical fruit tones. Incredible fresh hop taste but extremely smooth despite the bitterness with a hint of sweet bread for balance. The most remarkable point is how clean and crisp this was throughout for nose, taste, and palate. This is not a dank, chewy DIPA with a bitterness that lingers forever as if youre chewing on a hop cone. Do as Stone says and try one as fresh as possible.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"

But theyd only sell me two. Pours light amber gold with a creamy white head that laced a bit. Aroma is a sort of floral muted cat piss - which I take to be citrus. Med + body. Creamy/foamy carb. Flavor is definitely floral and citrus, over some rather low roast malt.  Malt is always their for support, but this is lightly astringent and mouthwateringly hoppy and bitter.

1185,"2013-01-18",4.6,"UPDATED: AUG 25, 2013 Poured (into a tulip) almost the color of a single malt with little head that quickly disappeared to nothing.  Nose was wonderful - citrus (especially orange and grapefruit) grass and some other herbs in the back.  Taste is, at first, pretty dry and bitter but quickly gives way to sweet citrus notes of lemon, mango and grapefruit. Finish brings in just enough malt to balance this nicely.  Alcohol warming is there as you would expect with the ABV, but not excessively.  Carbonation is fairly low but present nevertheless.  Mouthfeel is medium but doesnt present an overly cloying or sticky feel as you might expect.  All-in-all, this is a delicious west-coast style IPA I hope Stone shares again.
""Enjoyed"" from a bottle purchased from Pinocchios in Media and served in a snifter. Poured a light golden orange with a one-finger head which dissipated almost immediately to a thin coating. While there was light lacing, it marked the glass throughout. The nose was oranges, lemon, grapefruit, mango, and pine. The taste was wonderfully hop-centric, with oranges and lemon predominating but the malts in the background ALMOST come forward for balance. The finish was only slightly bitter, moderately dry and slick. Beer was medium in body and somewhat oily with nice carbonation.  None of these descriptors would necessarily suggest my conclusion that this was a GREAT DIPA.  I wasnt prepared for HOW good, given my previous experiences with Stones other Enjoy By offerings.

Really love this one-- my favorite Stone yet, by a good margin, and a notable IPA overall.

I know the whole marketing thing is ""freshness"" but if you would have handed this to be blind taste test, the first adjective out of my mouth would have been ""fresh.""  

Also ""clean""-- rarely have I tasted an IPA or I/DIPA that was as big as this, and still as well behaved. One sip and its throwing resiny peaches, gumballs and  grapefruit at you. . . and then upon swallowing a nice sweetness seeps in, and it fades pretty quickly.

Remarkable also for almost no nose.  Seriously, almost no smell whatsoever.  Which seems like a miss, but the taste makes it a mere curiosity.

1185,"2012-12-18",3.9,"In short: A monster fruity resinous golden IPA of superior quality.
How: Bottle 22oz, very fresh, batch By IPA 9.21.12 enjoyed on 9.2.12.  Bottle given to me in person by cstromberg57, thanks a lot Chris.
The look: Clear orange-golden body topped by a medium white head with medium retention and leaving lots of lacings on the glass.
In long: Nose is intensely citrusy hops (oranges and apricots coming out strong) with also some tropical fruits.  The fruity hops aroma is very bright and fresh but also rather resinous.  Taste has a lot of tasty crunchy caramelized malts upfront, a bit more residual sugars than I like in my hoppy beers, lots of dried fruits, big bold fruity-resinous hops with light piney notes.  High bitterness level that sticks to the back of the mouth.  Drinkability is not very high here, one bottle was enough for me even though Im a big hophead.  This monster hop-fix is the archetype of the more-is-better approach.  All beers like this should be enjoyed fresh, but I commend Stone for being so clear about the freshness of this particular beer.  I got this super fresh bottle from NH local cstromberg57 and then I enjoyed it the following day at my campground after a long day of hiking Mont Lafayette and other NH summits, because I have a life outside ratebeer, and having a life outside ratebeer is a great way to acquire new beers to rate on ratebeer.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Pours a crystal clear medium amber color with a decent sized white head that slowly dissipates to a cap. Citrus and pine fill the air as soon as I pop the cap on this one. Upon closer inspection my nostrils are delighted by hints of bread and caramel that have been devastated by an onslaught of hoppy goodness. Pepper and green onions mixed with grapefruit pine and resin round out the nose nicely. The flavor is a bit sweeter than I imagined based on the smell. Solid shot of caramel sweetness up front followed by a hint of alcohol and a smattering of pine citrus and onion. Medium body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet resinous mouthfeel.

1185,"2012-11-27",4.4,"Poured from a bottle into a tulip glass.
Aroma-Tropical fruits, Citrus, Grape fruit, and  Lots of Pine! Smell was great like DIPA should be.
Appearance-Light Amber color that was super clear no haze at all. Nice off white head with tight bubbles that dissipated quickly because of the higher ABV. Good amount of carbonation.
Taste-Begins with sweetness from then malts and bitterness from the hops. Not bad at all. I did not taste a lot alcohol but it was there towards the end. Not a lot of lingering aftertaste you get from most DIPA.
Palate- Carbonation was average and finish was bitter but in a good way.
Overall-Excellent brew from Stone get this if you can! Should pair nicely with food. Maybe some tacos. I would recommend this one to friend.","","ToastedMUFFiN1"

I was worried this might be another Wookey Jack pine-bomb, but thankfully, Stone balances the pine with delicious malts in the flavor department, and the palate/body are just perfect.  In-your-face hops for sure, but not one-dimensional by any means.  Kind of your classic strong DIPA in most ways, actually.  Ruination is much better, but this is by no means a bad DIPA.

This was tasty and enjoyable. A quality brew from Stone. Nothing too different from their current IPA offerings though. Probably one of the freshest tasting beers from a bottle. Seems more of a marketing endeavor. Very good beer but nothing Id write home about.

Then finishes dry with more tropical and citrus fruits, as well as some pine qualities. Very smooth and crisp finish that cleans the palate and makes you want to take another sip. Has a slight sweetness throughout, which complements the hop characters and gives the hop flavors almost a gummy bear-like taste. High medium, oily body. No alcohol detected at all.

The malts are fruity and sweet. The hops are grapefruity, citrusy and piney. Nice carbonation. This is still a big hoppy beer, but not as big hops as the 11/9/12 batch. The malts are very much more evident. I wonder what changed, was it me or was it the beer. I had this one on the last day, and I wonder if it was part of the reason.

Location: 22 oz bottle from Buy Rite, 9/6/13, Enjoy by 9/13/13


Aroma: The aroma is big on resin/pine hop goodness, with plenty of grapefruit and other fruit

Appearance: It pours a clear, bright orange color with a small white head and drippy lace

Flavor: The flavor is at its hoppy best, lots of pine/resiny bitterness, with a mild sweetness

Palate: The body is medium, it has a clean, sticky feel, soft carbonation, and a long, dry finish

Overall Impression: 
I think this one has to go down as the best of the batches that I have rated.  This beer was really at its hoppy prime in both aroma and flavor.  Im looking forward to drinking from the future batches, and I hope they are all this good.
4.3: 9/4/9/4/17 - This ended up being my highest score, so Ill reflect this one my tracked scoring.


Location: 22 oz bottle from Buy Rite, 5/13/13, Enjoy by 5/17/13


Aroma: It has a hoppy nose, with lots of tropical fruit (grapefruit, etc.) and plenty of pine/resin too

Appearance: Poured a completely clear orange color with a small white head and spotty lace

Flavor: Tastes lightly sweet, and medium-heavy bitter, similar to the nose component-wise

Palate: The body is medium-full with average carbonation, and a somewhat dry finish

Overall Impression: 
First off, Im a little surprised Buy Rite still had so many of these this weekend (they had a ton), considering how close we are to the giant date on the bottle, and it gives me some (additional) pause as to their (sometimes fairly dusty) bottle selection.  (Honestly, I was already feeling like they may be letting bottles sit too long, but this adds to my feeling.)  Anyway, I really felt like this one was 95% as good as the 2/15/13 version, but it wasnt quite there.  I even got a buttery hint here that Id never noticed in past version (rated or unrated).  The moral of the story seems to be that the further before the date it is drank (and also, for some reason, the further from NJ it is drank) the better.  
3.9:7/4/8/4/16 - Ill still leave the score with the highest rating I had, just because that is the kind of guy I am.

Appearance: Pours a clear gold color with a small bubbly white head and some scattered lace

Flavor: The flavor is clean and bitter with lots of dank, resiny hops, and a little grapefruit sweetness

Palate: The body is medium, it is sticky, the alcohol is really well-hidden, and it finishes rather dry

Overall Impression: 
I made the cutoff this time!  Thanks Kramer!  This one really is exactly what it is trying to be: a big, fresh, and resiny IIPA.  It doesnt apologize for being exactly that.  Really good stuff.  I enjoyed this one even more then 9/21/12.

Palate: The body is medium-full with average carbonation, and a somewhat dry finish

Overall Impression: 
We missed the cut-off date, oh well...From what I was told, this one had been in the fridge since purchase, so Im sure it was still pretty fresh.  Anyway, this is another very solid one (in a long line of very solid IPAs from Stone).

1185,"2012-08-26",4.4,"UPDATED: NOV 25, 2012 Clear golden orange with a small, sudsy white head. The aroma is super hoppy with lots of citrus, pine, and flowers. The flavor has a very oily, resinous quality to it, with a decent amount of sweetness. The hops are the star of the show. Strong bitter finish on the end, a tad warm. This reminds of super fresh Hop Stoopid or something along those lines. Perhaps hop extract is involved? In any case, very hoppy and therefore tasty.","Joliet, Illinois, USA","monkeychugg55"

On the palate, the first sips are a bit disappointing.  I didnt find it to be nearly as hoppy as the aroma would have indicated it would be.  However, a combination of some warming and some palate coating lead to a really interesting hop profile.  Very spicy with some of the florals in the background.  Juicy grapefruit.  The malts are really nicely sweet and bready with great balance.  The alcohol is also hidden incredibly well.  If you told me this one was 6% Id have no trouble believing you.

1185,"2012-08-25",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 1, 2013 Bottled on April 13, 2013, Enjoy by 5-17-2013.
Appearance: The body is clear with a beautiful golden amber hue, the head is short though even on a hard pour and the retention isnt very great either. The head settles into a frothy uneven coating.
Aroma: The aroma is strong of oranges, pine, grapefruit, and grass. The aroma is very resinous, a bit too much upon swirling.
Taste: This is a very hop forward beer, as to be expected, but surprisingly theres enough balance to keep this interesting. The malt base is outshined by a grapefruit, grassy, piney and spicy hop profile, but it provides a light sweetness, notably some caramel on the finish.
Palate: Medium bodied with lively carbonation.
Overall: This gets near the same ratings that the 9/21/2012 one gets. Its very similar from memory, but perhaps a tad more balanced. I dont love this, but its a good IPA and I see why people love it.

Bottled on 8-17-2012. Enjoy by 9-21-2012.

A: This is a pretty good looking IIPA, haze is minimal in the amber body as carbonation bubbles gently float towards the surface in every part of the beer. A thick and messy white head sits on top. This is how an IIPA should look.

S: Very pungent hop aroma that I can smell from near arms reach away. Putting the beer to my nose produces an intense aroma of hops hinting at spices, oranges and grapefruit providing a moderately bitter and moderately sweet aroma.  

T: The flavor is a bit bland up front, moderately sweet, but the grapefruit bitterness hits hard with a perfume like floral flavor at the end with a lingering spicy tingle down my throat. This isnt a huge hop-bomb, but it definitely caters to hop lovers more than the sweeter IIPA lovers.

M: Medium-thick bodied with soft carbonation. 

O: This is a West-coast IIPA through and through, the hops hit hard and do not disappoint. I personally prefer the sweeter IIPAs, but this is a good change of pace and I applaud Stone for providing such a fresh IIPA for us and making sure we drink it fresh.

1185,"2012-08-25",3.7,"Draft at The Blue Monkey Tavern in Merchantville, NJ. samples on 8.24.12. 

Pours a hazy golden orange color with tangerine edges and a one finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring.  Spotty lacing left behind. 

Dank and über fresh floral hop aroma with earthy pine needle and spicy, grassy hop notes countered by citrus and tropical fruit notes.  Really tropical with mango, papaya and pineapple along with orange peel, tangerine and curaçao.  Pale malts underneath with biscuit and grainy graham cracker. 

Chewy full body thats much heavier than anticipated.   Slightly hurts the drinkability.  Dry bitterness up front with dank, sticky hops that linger over sweeter notes and pale malt into a slightly dry finish.  Spicy hops, grass and earthy pine are slightly floral but countered by sweet fruit notes.  Not as tropical as nose suggests with some grapefruit, pineapple and orange peel.  Pale malt backbone is a bit stronger than I prefer with strong biscuit and graham cracker graininess toward the finish.  Also, theres a strong perfumy booziness that gives off some distracting sweetness toward finish.m ABV is decently masked for 9.4 but its still a bit strong for me taking away from the hops.  Overall, this beer has some nice hop flavors but needs more tropical/citrus fruit sweetness, a  lighter body and less booze.  Decent but nothing out of the ordinary.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

I was lucky to have it on tap at Eureka Burger Claremont last night. After having a Pliny and a Sculpin I had one of these and thought it stood up to both if not slightly above. I love the floral aroma and the dryness of this beer. Stone went a different direction with this one being it is not bitter like all of their other stuff. Great DIPA if you can find it.

1185,"2012-08-25",4.2,"Tap (Snifter) and Bottle (GI IPA Tulip): Pours a sunset amber hue with golden highlights topped by a lasting frothy head and left very good lace on the snifter but not as much from the tulip. The aroma has notes of mango, grapefruit, apricot, and berries esters along with a solid pine and earthy hops vapour. Some biscuity and caramel malt nose with a dash of mineral and flower beds. Most excellent aroma on tap (10) and very nice out of the bottle (8). Ill give it a 9 overall. The taste is bright citrus, some fleshy fruit, a hint of acidity along with a touch of hop spice, moderate pine and dank, and even a bit earthy. The malts are there but strictly a background player. A bit of alcohol sneaks up on you are awhile. The taste is pretty much the same tap and bottle. The mouth feel is more aggressive and lively via tap, really works to cleanse the palate(5). Not that the mouth feel is bad from bottle, just a bit more subdued which makes the alcohol more prevalent in bottled form (4). I will stick with a 4 rating here. Overall this is very nice beer and I must say I think I like this better than the 10th Ruination because it a tad closer to balance and far less dank.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
1185,"2012-08-24",3.7,"Good beer.  Its high point is hiding the high ABV extremely well.  Odd combo of peachy and piney.  Havent seen those two as an exclusive pair as far as I can remember.  Well attenuated for my taste, but peachy hop flavor isnt my favorite thing, always reminds me of diacetyl or a perceived thickness, I do however love pine, so thats a plus.

Medium bodied, earthy and sweet, toast and very thin caramel.  Lots af nice malt and toast.  Really easy drinking, big and hoppy.  Finishes up with some caramel, light malt and a very slow and gentle amount of bitterness.  The whole thing was sort of a decline from the amazing nose.

Dunno if they used it or not, but I cant taste it. Dry finish, bitterness peaked at a 4 with the aforementioned warming alcohol.

I had hoped my trajectory would take me past one of these beers, preferably on draft. So how lucky that I happened to notice it was on tap at Marias, right along the way home from the IIT campus. 
Draft IPA tulip, $6.
Smell is amazingly hoppy as one might expect mostly grass, with a little note of pine resin. Currently, the bartender has set a bottle of watermelon liqueur in front of me for mixing, and a patron next to me has been out dulling his senses with cigars. But yes, theres some citrus in the grapefruit family, too. Color is on the lighter side of an IPA, more gold than amber. Taste is an expected smackdown of hops that helps blow the memory of the cigar guy out of my olfactory. Hop smell stays strong through the glass. They also keep a big bitter aftertaste on the top part of my tongue that amplifies the malts more than they probably are. That is, a lighter malt as befits its color, with little caramel roast to it, just a small stage for the hops to work their magic. The alcohol shows up, with a warning that I might set that aerosol flavor spray the bartenders using on fire. Stays pretty bright in taste and texture. I;m still not feeling the octane internally, but its likely a good thing this is just a 12-ounce glass. Though the malts are light in color, they are definitely, um, making a statement. Any spills down the side of the glass get very sticky right away. A very complex hop bill sets this limited limited release aside from the others, and made me want to vote to make sure it comes back to Chicago on the next go-round.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"

1185,"2012-08-21",4.2,"Growler fill from brewery.  Pours from growler a very clear gold-orange hue with two fingers of fluffy and very white head with good retention.  Aroma of dank and resiny hops with lots of non-citrus tropical and stone fruit (peach, mango, mangosteen stand out) as well as some notes of white pepper.  Flavor predominately has fruity notes of tangerine, peach, and strawberry with some lesser ""traditional"" west coast DIPA elements of bitter citrus and pine.  The flavor has a later emerging lightly toasted caramel maltiness which adds good balance and a bit of sweetness.  I actually do not find this particularly bitter.  Medium body with a well-concealed 9.4%.  Having been to New Zealand a couple months ago and experiencing some of the great all-Kiwi hop IPAs there, I am pleased that Stone has opted to add the Motueka and Nelson Sauvin here...I like the more tropical fruit notes the Kiwi hops bring to the table.  Stone has certainly achieved what they set out to do here -- the hop elements of this beer come across super fresh with a zesty kick.  Though my rating is from the growler from the brewery, I am impressed with the lengths that Stone has gone to deliver this as fresh as physically possible to the public in SoCal, Chicago, and New Jersey...today is Tuesday and the beer was bottled only four days ago (and actually available on shelves yesterday, only three days after bottling).
