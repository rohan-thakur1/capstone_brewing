1918,"2012-12-28",3.1,"More of an IPA-style bitter, more carbonation than I expected. Okay copper body with little head, smooth finish, but its missing the proper bitter-ness of a proper English brew. Still all right.","Alberta, CANADA","DeanF"

1918,"2011-03-11",3.3,"Strong malt nose with plenty of lime/tangerine/bergamot in the nose. Clear brown body is topped by a finger of off-white head that recedes to a thin but lasting cover with some lace. Sweet and nutty malt flavours are joined by floral and citrus hops that provide medium off setting bitterness. Medium body is just a bit watery in texture with carbonation that just doesnt quite uplift it enough. Simple and pleasant enough but theres just something missing in the flavour. Sampled on tap at St. Augustines.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
