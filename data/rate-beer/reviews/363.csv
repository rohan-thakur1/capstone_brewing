363,"2017-04-29",4.1,"From notes. Enjoyed at Dougs house for the Whale Tasting and Poker Night, almost 18 months in planning. 500 mL bottle. The pour is a slightly cloudy golden yellow with a thin white head that leaves a little lace as it falls. The aroma is surprisingly lactic. There is a heavy citrus, both fruit flesh and zest with a nice sourness and a hint of oakiness. The flavor is much of the same. There is a light funkiness to it with the citrus about it and a light gueuze character. Its not too complex, but its slightly prevalent. The sourness is nice, but I think its a little more funky than I would like. The mouth feel is light and clean with a softer carbonation and a lingeringly funky citrus on the back end. This is pretty good, but just needs a touch of work.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

Many appropriate references to classic gueuze in this high quality American sour; buoyant stone fruit characteristics, sharp gravelly dryness, some oceanic brine action, balanced well and coalescing into a very convincing rendition. Highly attenuated body, feathery and crisp but fulsome. Its missing a certain intangible aliveness, the it factor of the great lambics, highly enjoyable regardless.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Nice bit of lemon citrus, great big oak. Moderate-plus sour taste, light sweet, mild dry. A wonderful, funky gueuze-style ale. This seems to be more with the gueuze flavor, than the typical gueuze sourness, which I dont mind at all. All of the 4 2015 R & D bottles I tried tonight... They were actually way less sour than I expected, judging from the wild blackberry sour that I will never forget.

-  Theres some herbal (almost vegetal) and mineral notes as secondary flavors. 
-  Well balanced, theres a nice acidic presence, but nothing harsh.

Pours a hazy golden bright hue, a touch of fiery orange, firmer whitish head atop is sizable, a nice firmer layer dies down quickly, a nice ringer sits atop, soapy with solid lacing throughout. Aromas are tart and lactic, stone fruit and straw meet yogurt, rustic grain and mellow tannic oak. Cobwebs, terroir funkiness meet some white grape, tart crab apple and a bit of fuzziness. Subtle melon, more grape and citric jabs. Initial is lighter in body, smoothed out fruit and melon, citrus and tart apple meet yogurt, earth and gentle straw and bready malts. Subtle grain, some punchy lactic life is a bit sour, white grape and a touch of lemon. Citric and lactic acidity melds into this one well. A bit dry, twangy. Light bodied, subtle carbonation that cuts through at times, at others the acidity rises up a bit and waves over the palate more firmly. A faint waft of pineapple, pear. A bit dry, subtle spice and oaky presence as we round the corner, touches of vanilla and tannic oak meet faint white wine, a bit more yogurt. Some funkiness, yeasty life. More yogurty and trailing fruit finish. A bit dry, lighter. I dig this. A nice blend, no element really every becomes too much or takes the lead, with a more tart, fruity nose that leads into a more expert integration, sour and fruity, yogurty twang with more of a tannic, subtle sweet trail out and young funk profile. Some slick sour lactic presence remains on the palate, a touch twangy/metallic. This one is ready to go right out of the gate.
