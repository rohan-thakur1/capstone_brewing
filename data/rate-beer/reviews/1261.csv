1261,"2015-10-10",4.0,"Draft at the brewery. Pour is deep caramel with a big eggshell colored head and great lacing. Big grassy, herbal hoppy, fresh baked bread, light caramel, somewhat earthy, and doughy aroma. Taste is herbal hoppy, grass, spicy hops, rye bread, fresh dough, caramel, and lightly toasty with a light bitter finish. Medium body with high carbonation. I could chug this stuff.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
1261,"2015-09-18",4.3,"On cask at Hogshead. Deep copper with a large off-white head. Aroma is of sticky caramel and toffee, pound cake, light bread dough, marzipan and light coconut. Taste is of rich toffee, caramel syrup, apple butter, and bread dough.","Arlington, Texas, USA","jkwalking05"
1261,"2015-09-18",3.6,"Tap. The look is reddish, off white head, and slightly cloudy. The smell is doughy, fruit, malt, rich, and good. The taste is similar, fruit, dough, yeast, good.","Dallas, Texas, USA","travita"
1261,"2015-04-06",3.2,"Clear beautiful dark Amber with a rocky light beige head. Musty English ale yeast Nose with a touch of mineral water and grassy hops and dirty toasted malt. Full body with some chewy toasted malt, stern grassy hoppy bitterness, bright and complex esb malt and some toast. Meh. Regular chin wag is better because I feel like it has some more complexity that this one is hiding underneath a more stern alcohol note. Though in the flavor I wouldnt say that alcohol is a primary flavor.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"
1261,"2014-10-31",3.5,"Caramel brown pour, white head. Smooth and creamy, lightly bitter, toasted grain, honey, doughy malts. Nice stuff.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
1261,"2014-09-29",3.7,"On cask at the brewery. Deep reddish amber appearance with a lacy, lasting tan head. Darker, mildly sweet malts balanced by a mild earthy hop bitterness. Notes of light caramel and light chocolate malt. Smooth and creamy feel with a medium body. Pretty tasty.","Denver, Colorado, USA","ajnepple"
1261,"2014-04-19",4.0,"Draft at the brewery - something that I have always loved about Hogsheads beer when it is at its best is how vibrant and expressive the malt character is and how well it plays with the earthy, musty English ale yeast - that quality is really on display here - lovely mix of dry, earthy, whiskey-like malte character, with a countering cherry sweetness, a mild mineral presence, and a musty yeast character - even on draft, I love this.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
1261,"2014-04-08",3.5,"5 oz sample draft at Colorado Plus in Wheat Ridge, Colorado. The pour is clear brown golden with not too much off white head. The aroma is sweet caramel malt, grass and some earth. The taste is a nice balance of crystal malt, soft honey sweetness and grassiness. The palate is medium bodied with soft carbonation and the lingering sweet earth. Nice.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
1261,"2014-03-28",3.7,"Very sweet, with nice malts. Towards the end it got a little overly sticky, but the flavor made up for it.

1261,"2013-04-07",4.3,"firkin dry-hopped with Simcoe.  beautiful and rich dark chestnut brown body with a thick fine-bubbled off-white head and slow-cascading edges. again Hogshead seems to use the simcoe hop well in their English-style beer - it lends a faint citrus and dried grass character to the malt aroma and flavor, which is a most intoxicating maris otter showcase. lot of nuts, toffee, baked bread, brown sugar sweet cookies and marzipan / almond pastry... even some of that brined maraschino cherry aroma and flavor that nearly translates into a sort of cognac and whiskey malt profile... and the body is succulent and beefy and perfectly-suited for the malt sweetness level.  very rich and full presence in the mouth; a pithy citrus bitterness; very clean yeast profile.  its not ""doubled up"" like American beer, dont be fooled.  its only in the low-6% ABV range; alcohol isnt apparent at all.  its just a magical play of malt and hops with a musty and rich English ale yeast lending a hand. this is easily the best thing Ive had from Hogshead in the last few months, and may rival some of my favorite early batches of Lake Lightning and Chin Wag.  applause.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
1261,"2013-04-07",4.3,"On cask at Hogshead poured a clear reddish brown with a lasting amber head. Aromas of carmel, earthiness, light grapefruit, light pine and light toffee. Palate was light to medium bodied and smooth with a dry finish. Flavors of carmel, earthiness, light pine, light toffee and light grapefruit zest with a smooth dry lingering carmel finish.","Arvada, Colorado, USA","Ratman197"
