Cloudy pale golden color with a small white head.
Very nice NZ hoppy aroma with some bitterness and fruity freshness. The flavor is strong bitterness, NZ hops, some balancing maltiness and some fruitiness. Nice. Tasty.","Tampere, FINLAND","rosenbergh"
803,"2017-01-20",3.6,"Bottle from Beer Gonzo. Milky golden body with a thick white head. Low carbonation. Faint lacing. Aroma of corn flakes, lemon zest and pineapple. Flavour of sponge cake, tinned oranges, green tea and hay. Medium body with a creamy texture. Soft fizz. Quite sweet but with interesting flavours.","Edinburgh, SCOTLAND","jamestulloch"
803,"2017-01-12",4.1,"Bottle at home thanks to Santa minutemat! A bit hazy golden with good sized white head. Lots of mango, pineapple and other tropical fruits. Almost like fruit juice. Theres also some dank marijuana (haze) with grass and herbs. Light creamy malts, slightly crisp at the same time which sounds weird but it works nice. Its about medium sweet and slightly lighter bitter in a grassy way. Could maybe be a touch more bitter to balance the sweetness though the bitterness gets more pronounced as the beer warms a bit. Over medium bodied with slight crisp finish. Very nice beer.","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","Maakun"
803,"2016-12-30",3.9,"20th December 2016Hazy yellowish gold beer, tidy pale cream colour head. Palate is airy, fairly dry and has good fine minerally carbonation. Nice malts, light and slightly bready in that Czech pils way. Touch of creamy sweetness. Tangy start to the hops and then good spicy grapefruit, soft skunk underneath. Touches of tangy orange and lemon. Light hop spicy finish. Comes together well in to a very good hoppy lager.",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"

Bittersweet citrus fruits, grapefruit, orange peel, sweet grain malts, soft carbonation, medium bodied, light alcohol in the finish, more bitter lemon.

803,"2016-11-30",4.0,"Phew. Imperial it is. Crisp dry and loads of fruits, resin and bitterness. Still recognizable as pilsner, but a long way from it and so much better.","NETHERLANDS","langeveld12"

803,"2016-10-20",3.7,"330ml bottle. Clear golden colour. White head. NZ hop flavoured aroma. White grape, pithy tangerine, tomato seed. Bitter taste with something vegetal lurking. Wouldnt guess the style if I didnt know. Nice effort.","Cheshire, ENGLAND","Nocturne"
803,"2016-10-05",4.2,"330ml bottle @ Chez Sophie, whilst listening to Black Cobra. Pours a misty gold, small white head. Aroma is fruity with apricots and mango. Taste continues with smooth fleshy exotic fruit, lime juice and some grapefruit bitterness. Has very little in the way of pilsner characteristics really. Similar to Damage Plans smooth fruity DIPA leanings. Very good.","Shrewsbury, Shropshire, ENGLAND","minutemat"
