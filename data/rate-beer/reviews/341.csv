341,"2017-06-14",3.9,"UPDATED: JUN 15, 2017 375 ml bottle, bb 14-03-2026, shared by Werckmeister, thanks!
Amber copper, clear body, with a small, frothy, off-white head. 
Aroma of barnyard, vinegar, red apples, wine, oak, some red berries, some citrus. 
Tastes quite similar, but with more acid, some unripe pears. 
Light, slick mouthfeel, with a moderate carbonation. 
Finishes acidic, dry, wooden, a bit vinous, fruity, with apples, pears, 

Very nice. I really like the nose, which is very elegant, despite the acidic notes. Taste has more of the vinegary sour notes, while Its also nice. Not my favourite Tilquin, but a very nice, characterful one.

Light-medium bodied, with a musty, funky, slightly acetic, and earthy mouthfeel. Another excellent offering from Tilquin.

Pours a pretty lightly hazy golden color with a nice head & good lacing on the glass.

The aroma is pungent and funky with lots of oak, but also a nice soft fruit character with a mild lemon and cherry aroma. Unique.

The flavor is similarly unique.... very very dry with a lot of lemony sourness... but also very earthy & honestly not dissimilar to a fruitiness one would come to expect from a Chablis or maybe a fruit forward Riesling. The oak & mild bitterness make this a very bold
Gueuze but the soft accents make it very special.

Pours an amber-orange color with almost no head, but a small, white, bubbly film at the rim of the glass.

My room is filled with funk and barnyard aromas even before I put my nose into the glass. Huge oak and dusty earth presence, which balances the prominent funk, consisting of old, dried orange, green apple peel and blue cheese. Mushroom, old cheese rind and wet hay enhance the complexity on the nose, alluding to a great tasting beer.

Has a lower carbonation, which perfectly highlights the multi layered taste in this, with a funk defined tartness, finished by a mineral dry note, while the mouthfeel remains pleasantly soft and refreshing.

Orange peel from the nose is present on the taste, blue cheese and old, moldy malts as well. Its heavier body gets reflected in those qualities, which are off the chain, truly intense with a lot of further reaching accompanying flavors. Offers a musty, fruity sweet malt foundation, which results into a tooth numbing, sour dryness. Finishes with mushrooms, even more blue cheese, a mineralic softness and a pungent, malt coated tartness, which lingers on the tongue for quite a while.

Fantastic beer, this one convinces for its rich funkiness and balance, providing a great complexity, with everything staying in perfect balance. Its oaken wood and malt backbone makes this unique, highlighting the funk in the most pleasant way.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Pours from the bottle with a thin pale tan head. Pale amber color. The aroma smells of musty mushrooms, musty, oak wood, a bit of urine even, a hint of cider, as well as some dried straw / weed, pale grain character and pale cracker notes. Basically this smells like a perfect Gueuze at this moment.

Aggressively sour, though not too bracingly, lots of musty notes, a bit of urine character, musky barnyard funky notes, and a finish that is woody, slightly astringent, and aged-hop bitter. A touch of cider character adds some fruitiness, and some tart, green, not quite ripe fruit notes. A touch of chemical character that is not quite plastic, not really cleaner, but subtly piquant.

Nose is surprisingly rich and fruity with notes of Asian pear, green apple, lemon, grapefruit, something like peach/apricot. Some acetone, lacto sourness with vinegar in support, a sweaty sort of funk. Wood is weaker than expected. Flavour is exceptionally fruity, quite sour with a real citrus edge, lactic at the start. Cider vinegar fills in for a more complex sourness. Apple and pear flesh up front too. Grape skin towards the finish with lots of oak, hay and light horseblanket. The puckering citrus and acidic notes remain all the way through and balance the tannic, astringent dryness from the wood. Feels fairly substantial for a gueuze, fullish of body and rich from wood and malt, but also still lively from fruitiness. Light carb. Great beer. Maybe it started as an accident but it ended as by far my favourite Tilquin, layered, balanced, full of flavour.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"

Aromas of big lemon, lime, grapefruit, orange peel, green apple, pear, white grape, white vinegar, pepper, leather, oak, wheat, cracker, hay, straw, grass, musty funk, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, oak barrel, and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength.

Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/funky/acidic yeast, oak, and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/tart/spiciness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately acidic, and lightly crisp/sticky mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warmth lingering after the finish.

OCZY : piwo ma kolor pomarańczowy, delikatnie opalizujący z widocznym nasyceniem. Piana piwa jest niewielka i mało trwała. 

NOS : z daleka piwo ma dosyć ""słodkawy"" aromat drewna i torfu. Zbliżając nos wyczuwam ewidentnie kwaskowate aromaty niedojrzałego jabłka, skórki cytrynowej. Aromaty nie są mocno intensywne. Po wstrząśnięciu piwo uderza w nos świeżym aromatem jabłka, moreli, nasion i oczywiście tarty. 

USTA : piwo ma spore nasycenie i jest średnio wodniste. 
Oczywiście głównym smakiem jest ściągająca kwaśność. Przypomina kwasek cytrynowy, który w posmaku jest na granicy octu. W posmaku występuje również cierpkość z nutami drewna. Alkohol jest słabo wyczuwalny. Nawet po kilku łykach nie ma saturacji kwaśnością. 

ODCZUCIA : bardzo łatwy w piciu z niebezpiecznie ukrytym alkoholem. Uwaga!

341,"2015-05-30",4.4,"Tilquins geuze but fermented a second time, resulting in a considerably higher ABV than usual for the style. Curious about this one... Beautiful, warm deep orangey colour (probably a tad darker than the regular, which may have to do with the higher ABV), misty with champenoise sparkles, under a medium, egg-white, moussy head with moderate retention. Musty and funky aroma of lemon, unsweetened yoghurt, dusty cellar, sulphur, wet cardboard, damp earth, ripe apricot, botanical roses, starfruit, dry sherry, hint of tobacco, hay, dried parsley and a subtle but clear animalistic smell of wet leather, stale sweat and even chicken broth, but fitting into the whole and in that sense not even disturbing, only adding lambic funkiness the way I like it. Taste starts with a vivid estery fruitiness of sour berries and unripe stonefruit mixed with a sharp lemon acidity, drying the mouth but tantalising the salivary glands; a dusty, powdery, almost starch-like mouthfeel appears as well, enlightened by the carbonation. The complete and pure lambic profile shines in all its glory: soft wheat sourishness, light bready malts in the background, all drenched in a complex play of sour and musty, with a leathery Brett effect in the finish, along with the expected persisting drying acidity, slightly bitter, earthy hops providing closure, and wood accents. The alcohol remains completely hidden. Bone dry (and therefore very appetizing!), full, completely satisfying geuze, perhaps a bit deeper than the regular version. Excellent.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

The flavor profile has a nice mouthfeel, with zesty lemon, woody notes, pepper, moving to feint apple, spent grain, with some funk presence. Its tangy, tart with cracker crust, and a touch of grapefruit as well. It finishes dry, naturally...

A - Very dark orange, 2 finger bubbly head that faded fast on a very clear pour of zero sediment. 

S - The nose is unlike any Gueuze Ive ever had. Kiwi, mango, tropical fruits, light blue cheese funk, a lot of oak but overall just a hugely bright acidic fruit forward nose. The nose itself is a perfect 10. 

T - The taste is also just as fruity as the nose. Its quite funky but nothing surprising for a 2011 bottling and the obvious addition of more oak is really pleasant and appreciated. I get lemon and lime zest but only faintly. Its as if they took an Oude Gueuze, added more tannic red wine elements and a touch of cognac and then threw in a ton of fruit adjuncts. 

M - Crisp and light, nothing too intense but it is far less carbonated than a standard Tilquin Gueuze but no way near flat. 

O - Very impressive beer. I want more and more of this and Pierre, please continue to make this if you can. Incredible beer.","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"

341,"2014-09-10",4.2,"Bouteille 37.5cl partagée avec Pierre. Beaucoup dattente pour cette Gueuze, surtout après en avoir débouchonné un bon millier. Cette dernière à lalcool plus relevé nen reste pas moins une autre belle production de Tilquin. La couleur reste fidèle à la gueuze de base avec un léger voile doré étant peut-être plus foncé. Un léger trouble est également présent. Le col est généreux, restant crémeux et soyeux dans un ton blanc voire blanc-cassé onctueux. La sursaturation nest plus quun mauvais souvenir, et le visuel est au rendez-vous. 
Au nez, je retrouve, ici encore, une gueuze très rafraichissante même en étant à 7.6%. Ce deuxième passage en fût de chêne nest que tout bénéficie. Des effluves boisées plus prononcées séchappent et offrent un subtil ajout de chêne qui oscille entre léger tanin et un rétro-nasal plus poussé du chêne sans que je puisse y détecter un semblant doxydation. 
Ce bonheur, gustatif, pour le décrire ainsi, se retrouve au niveau du palais qui nest également pas en reste. Cette fois-ci cest du côté du chêne que tout se joue. Je trouve cette deuxième mise en fût tout à lavantage du produit de base. Là où bons nombres de brasseries échouent. Le chêne est nettement plus en avant que sur la Gueuze à lAncienne mais sans être surfait. Le tout reste subtil tout en jouant sur le caractère sec, légèrement suret et effervescent de la gueuze qui est accompagné de pointes fruitées légèrement citronnée et de légers tanins qui accompagnent ce profil de chêne qui rajoute une dimension à la gueuze. A mettre en cave, comme la Gueuze Tilquin une bière qui pour moi gagne en maturité et complexité après une bonne année, voire deux, de cave.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
