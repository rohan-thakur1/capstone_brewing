Flavor is earthy yeast, with more pink bubblegum. A tart stone fruit on the back of the tongue: a plum, methinks. Slight cherry cough drop. Slight grassy complexion, but quickly gives way to a darker berry.

Feels bubbly and thick and effervescent. This is a wonderful gateway beer, especially for a red wine drinker. Its very pleasant, and not incredibly challenging. The yeast-tart balance is like a slow-dance.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

766,"2013-10-07",4.0,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 500ml bottle into a tall weizen glass. The label has a ""BEST BEFORE END"" date and no abv.

Appearance: The body has a brownish tan color with a very hazy or cloudy look. From the pour I got an average size off white head that slowly settles to a light ring of foam. Lacing is very slick and slides right down the glass as I drink leaving no traces behind.

Smell: It has a deep yeast and wheat character. Classic German notes of banana and clove come through with a heavy sweet wheat presence. Hops are very distant and are barely noticeable.

Taste/Palate: There are big banana notes with spicy clove on a solid bed of sweet/sour doughy bready maltiness. The hops are laid back and offer very little bitterness and just a slight touch of earthy/leafy character. The palate has an almost chewy slick or creamy feel with soft carbonation.

Notes: Overall its a good solid Dunkelweizen with all the good classic German flavors.","New York, USA","generallee08"

Appearance: Opaque brown body with a glowing ruby red aura. Forms a large, white, frothy barm which mostly dissipates and leaves only minor lacing. 

Smell: Mostly just banana, no spice notes. Also quite mild.

Taste: Im a big fan of wheat beers. It seems to me that theyre a hard style to get wrong. Even if you make one by the book it may be unoriginal, but itll be good. For some reason, Julius Echter Hefe-Weiss-Dunkel comes up a bit short. While not a bad beer at all, its a little too mild for its own good. 

The palette doesnt have a lot of distinctive character to it. Similar to most German wheat beers with the usual notes of banana and clove, but this time theyre mild and contained. I prefer cinnamon bread character from a dunkelweizen, but this one is just plain bready. Theres a faint sweet taste right as it finishes, but its not a beer that I would consider robust. Thankfully, theres no off flavors, and those that are present become more prominent as it warms. Maybe its just an old bottle, but the fact remains this is an okay beer at best.

Drinkability: I deliberately bought and drank Julius Echter Hefe-Weiss-Dunkel for its performance value. I had just come back from a long walk on a hot, humid day and this was the refresher I was seeking. It was comfortable in the mouth with noticeable carbonation, but with a smooth finish.

Aromas are feint. Tastes of citrus, banana, and corn. I wasn't expecting the corn smells or flavors. Relatively high carbonation and smooth palate makes it an easy drinking brew. Overall, I prefer the standard vs the dark. The aromas and flavors are there but more bland than I was expecting.

766,"2012-06-20",3.7,"Bottle at homebrew club. Pours a deep bronze with a big head. Nose is really nice. Light citrus and then a bunch of creamy banana and clove. Bready with a good wheat thing going on. Some cocoa in the nose as well. On tasting, creamy and full, good balance between the yeast and grain. Bready and full flavored. Really nice stuff.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
766,"2012-05-02",4.0,"Originally reviewed: 4/20/09. Pours a cloudy brown with a huge ivory head billowing forth. Great retention, but absolutely wanting of any lacing rings or sticky globs. Smells of nutmeg, banana, hints of clove, and bread. Very much a bready beer. 

Mouthfeel is a tad wet, but firm overall. Flavor was a little weaker than I was expecting, but good nonetheless. Some warm bready flavor with hints of brown sugar, slight fruitiness, and finishes sweet. Drinkability is high on this beer. There is nothing harsh here at all. Just a well-done Dunkel. Recommend.","Winston-Salem, North Carolina, USA","Onenote81"

766,"2011-04-20",4.0,"Presentation: It was poured from a brown 500ml bottle into a tall weizen glass. The label has a ""BEST BEFORE END"" date and no abv.

Appearance: The body has a brownish tan color with a very hazy or cloudy look. From the pour I got an average size off white head that slowly settles to a light ring of foam. Lacing is very slick and slides right down the glass as I drink leaving no traces behind.

Smell: It has a deep yeast and wheat character. Classic German notes of banana and clove come through with a heavy sweet wheat presence. Hops are very distant and are barely noticeable.

Taste/Palate: There are big banana notes with spicy clove on a solid bed of sweet/sour doughy bready maltiness. The hops are laid back and offer very little bitterness and just a slight touch of earthy/leafy character. The palate has an almost chewy slick or creamy feel with soft carbonation.

Notes: Overall its a good solid Dunkelweizen with all the good classic German flavors.","Alden, New York, USA","rampmaster"

766,"2010-10-22",3.1,"She pours with a soft foamy head draped in khakis and tans looking much like whipped coffee ice cream, another special childhood memory. Her body underneath resembles soft pumpernickel bread marked by a gentle haze that lets just enough light in to give her dark hues a pleasing glow. Bran muffins, cinnamon, bananas, clove, apricot, figs, and dark breads reach out to me from the safe confines of my hefeweizen glass. Red apple skins for a touch of bitterness before I am back in the lap of banana bread and clove luxury. Enough of this smelling stuff; Im parched. Sweeter than her nose let on, but considering the larger addition of darker malts, I am appropriately not surprised. Red apples, maple, and apricots dapple in the fruity side along with plump white raisins and dates. Her soft mouthfeel exudes cinnamon and brown sugar which lingers long after each generous quaff. There are sippers and then there are drinkers, the latter of which the Julius Echter Dunkel Hefeweizen definitely qualifies. Fresh banana slices lay atop banana bread warm from the oven. Clove subtly weaves in and out of each flavor and my glass empties far sooner than anticipated.


You would think that in the sunny state of Florida, hefeweizen would be a guaranteed crowd pleaser. Not so, unfortunately, and I find the ripe esters of banana and clove that makes a hefeweizen a hefeweizen to be the general offender. For anyone a bit unsure as to the beauty of a traditional German hefeweizen, maybe a dip into the dark side first will do the palate some good. If not, it just means more Julius Echter Dunkel Hefeweizen for me.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"

A bit of nutmeg and clove spice up front, no bitterness, a bit of fruit sweetness and an interesting metallic twing on the finish. Nothing special about the palate, hung around for a bit, a bit oily, with a thin carbonation.

766,"2010-08-18",3.7,"Serving:  500 ml. bottle from Wegmans Leesburg.
Aroma: Primarily yeasty nose with some dark fruit, pumpernickel, and spicy wheat notes. 
Appearance:  It pours a cloudy brownish red with a sizable foamy off-white head.  Good head retention and spotty lacing left behind.
Taste: The taste initially carries all the notes from the nose, but in a much lighter package than the nose belies.  A nice bit of bready malt with dark fruit notes, but the wheat lightens things up and dries them out quite a bit.  What you are left with is both quite tasty and very drinkable.
Palate: Light to medium body with average carbonation and a dry, fruity finish. 
Overall: An enjoyable change when you are looking for something lighter light a wheat, but with a darker malt profile.  A very nice brew and definitely recommended.

Large creamy cap with stings of lacing. Moderate malt body, crisp with a drawn out smoothness. Delicate and tantalizing to the palate. Flavor is a wonderful marriage of fresh wheat and port.

766,"2007-12-31",3.6,"Pours with a frothy, light tan colored, initially three finger thick head that sits on top of a dark, amber tinged, brown colored brew that shows a lightly hazy, rich, ruby hue when held up to the light.  Quite fruity smelling with notes of raisins, green grapes, and Macintosh apples.  Malt notes of toasted grain, browned bread crust and complex and rich malt notes are pretty noticeable if you dig a bit for them.  More typical Hefe Weizen aromas of banana and clove come in as a sort of backdrop or supporting role.  At times it almost smells a bit like vanilla poached apples.

Light, but chewy enough that it is not watery at all.  The beer is lightly sweet with flavors of vanilla, raisins, tart apples and some spicy clove notes.  The darker malt flavors really turn on in the finish were a nice toasted malt flavor is evident; lightly toasted whole grain bread, a hint of chocolate and browned / caramelized malt sugars.  As my palate gets used to the flavors notes of banana and even some vanilla flavors start to come out.  This has an appetizing tartness to it that really makes this beer quite drinkable as well as cutting through the malt to keep this quite drinkable.  The yeast pour softens the beer a bit, it becomes rounder and loses a spicy sharpness that was there before.

Another interesting beer from this brewery, this could perhaps be a touch more focused on the Dunkel grain notes, but it does contribute.  A refreshing, easy drinking version that really starts to open up once it becomes a bit warmer.

766,"2007-08-28",3.4,"This brew pours a hazed nut brown color w/ a full creamy froth. Head retention is superb. Residual lacing consists of a full downy canopy and is lasting. Aroma is earthy w/ well aged malts. Medium nectar w/ low volume effers soft as cotton. This is an old world style. Very rustic w/ aged malts and flavors of decayed dark fruits. Its mildly spiced w/ nuances of moist cakebread, raisin, plum, cocoa, and tobacco. The finish is long w/ a mild acidic souring to bitter.
