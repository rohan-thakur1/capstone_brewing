12 oz bottle poured into a pint glass
Pours very dark brown light barley penetrates but does show a slightly reddish hue. Head is light tan which falls to a ring.
I get dark bread, wheat, toasted malt, fruit and some molasses.
Sweet and fruity in flavor. I get prunes as well as the molasses malt with a little bit of spicy hops on the finish
Medium body and quite smooth with a little carbonation tingle.
This is a very nice wiesenbock - great for a cold weather drink. Has similarities to a dopplebock in its richness and fruitiness. Interesting take and delicious. Its hard to believe that its 9.5%!","Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, ENGLAND","ThirstyBird"

3753,"2013-01-03",3.7,"UPDATED: JAN 6, 2013 
Location: Draft at Texas Arizona, 1/3/13


Aroma: The nose has a lot going on, wheat, clove/winter spices, banana, and raisin to name a few

Appearance: Pours a dark amber-brown color with a soapy beige head and medium lace

Flavor: It is medium sweet, much like the nose, fairly complex, with lots of spice/clove flavors

Palate: It has a medium-plus body, a tingly feel, and average-plus carbonation

Overall Impression: 
This one was served way too cold, and really needed to warm up to develop, but thats not the beers fault.  Anyway, I thought this was quite solid, with a nice amount of complexity.  Good stuff.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

A - Pours deep, dark, brown with a small thin cap of off white head leaving little to no lacing down the glass.

S - Smells of dulled wheat, chocolate, banana, light spice, sweet toffee, and some dark fruits. Not as strong as I was expecting but still plenty going on. The booze is ever present, getting stronger as the beer comes to room temp.

T - Flavors are similar to the nose with plenty of chocolate, clove, dark fruits, tart cherries, and bready wheat. The booze is light at the beginning only getting stronger as it warms. Finish is a mix of chewy wheat and lingering sweetness. Good balance overall, just a touch too much booze.

M - Medium-Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Full, chewy, feel with plenty of dry lingering chewy sweetness. The booze is ever present.

O - Not so much. I thought this one was ok but not anything mind blowing. The combo of strong flavors and 11% ABV. really make this one hard to drink.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

Overall - Solid beer overall. Only being sold at the brewery this year and I got this bottle from a friend (Thanks Steve!) who attended the release party.

S- Cocoa and dark chocolate come through. Some alcohol esters behind and a strong aroma of sourdough bread.

T- Initial flavor is mostly of tart sourdough bread with a hint of fruits such as plum and prune. A hint of clove comes through for the finish as the tartness intensifies. Interestingly enough what lingers on the palate is a hint of what seems to be cocoa and sweet raisins.

P- Mild to moderate carbonation and medium weight body that is neither smooth or crass.

O- This is certainly and interesting beer that has been on my wants list for awhile now...and I am glad I have had the opportunity to finally try it! Definitely worth a try and I will have it again-if the opportunity arises.

3753,"2010-04-08",4.0,"Appearance: Served up an almost black body crowned with a tall, proud, lasting tan head.

Smell: Lightly roasty, chocolate-based aroma with notes of dark wheat malt, dark caramel, cracked cloves, and well-ripened dark fruits.

Taste: Mildly, modestly sweet taste of chocolate-coated roasted grains further brushed with a bit of caramel. Slight flourish of tangy malted wheat. Hint of spicy clove character and smoked mingled into the dark fruitiness reminiscent of prunes and black cherries. Very subtle bitterness. Picks up a bit more sweetness as you go.

Aroma speaks of umami, reduced hazlenut sauce, and soy. Dense and browned. Flavor is similar with a strong sugary side to things. This is damn near barbeque sauce. A puckery blend of raw apple cider, blackstrap molasses, black cherry juice, sassafras, mission fig pudding, and burnt caramel. Its got a decent flavor profile, but the melanoidins and glutamates are almost too concentrated and biting for me. it really resembles soy sauce in some way and starts to near Sam Adams Triple Bock.

3753,"2008-10-21",3.5,"Bottle courtesy of JB175. My first from the Garden State  thanks Jason!  Pours a murky reddish brown with an initial 3 finger fizzy tan head that fades fairly quick and zero lacing.  I didnt expect this one to be dark at all. Nose is sweet malt, dark fruits and light roasted coffee.  Taste is dark fruits, bitter dark chocolate and sour coffee grounds.    Theres definitely an alcohol burn in the finish as well.  Medium, semi-creamy and  prickly mouth feel.  Not bad  not what I expected at all, but a decent brew.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","Sparky"

3753,"2008-08-22",3.4,"Pours opaque mahogany with crimson edging. Barely a trace of spritzy head rose up before instantly dissapearing. Zero lacework or retention.

Aromatics are full-on malty, with a trace of chocolate and a good whiff of alcohol. Quite clean and caramel-stuffed.

On the thick side of medium bodied, sticky and slick. Low carbonation adds some cloyness.

Rich malt, caramel, and chocolate lead off the pallet. Alcohol follows through with some substantial warmth. A slight tang from the wheat but otherwise a very clean lager.

Finishes with lingering caramel, chocolate and some faint wet paper.

This one is tasting a bit stale, or maybe it was never too spectacular to begin with?
The lack of carbonation and poor retention is not a good sign, regardless.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","brewandbbq"
3753,"2008-08-14",3.3,"Pours a dark cola with a strong head that dissipates quickly. Aroma is very complex. Black pepper, cloves, allspice and some sweet malt. Taste is disappointing. I taste some smoke, a horse blanket aroma of dust and some sweet malt but very little in the way of wheat.  Perhaps it was the bottle. It wasnt one of my favorites. Ill try again and re-rate in the near future.","New York, USA","JCastner"

3753,"2008-07-05",4.4,"2005 Bottle. 

Pours out a very dark brown with dark red around the edges when held to light. Head was fairly big and a light tan color, retains well, but not as pillowy as one might expect. The smell is one that I’ve been waiting to experience, almost a revelation. It smells like a wonderful Christmas cookie. It’s like a chocolate dipped banana plum, mixed with caramel and molasses cookies. Taste begins with some plum and a bit of dark fruit, plenty of Christmas spices as well, then ends up having a hint of burnt caramel and just a touch of coffee-like roastiness. Carbonation is on the higher side with just a little bit less than medium body. Alcohol is very well hidden in this one. I’m going to see if I can’t get more of this so I can enjoy plenty of it during the next holiday season, although I’m sure this is great in any weather.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

3753,"2008-06-04",2.5,"12 fl. oz. bottle via sammy (thanks!), served at cellar temperature in a tulip glass.
App.:  Moderate cola, vanishing tan head, clear.
  
Aroma:  Lots of boozy currants, raisins, light coffee, milk chocolate, vanilla, minty herbals, some other dried fruits, a bit of wood and some light warm spices, some brown sugar and molasses.

Palate:  Medium+ body, fairly soft but present effervescence.
  
Flav.:  Some of the currants, clove and esters, a bit of wood and chocolate, a bit of molasses; quite tart...thats not right, is it?; a bit of mineral and coffee to finish.

3753,"2008-04-14",3.5,"Pours extremely dark, inky purple to virtually black in color.  A fizzy tan head disappears rapidly and leaves absolutely no lacing behind.  Dark, fruity aromas of fig, raison, and plum dominate the nose, with sugar glazed banana bread and cinnamon adding further richness.  Flavors again show alot of dark fruit, though things turn a bit more sour and tannic, almost vinous on certain spots of the tongue.  The back-and-forth play between sweet and sour is interesting, with sweet, dark fruits and caramel dominating the foreground, only to be overtaken and surpassed by sour grape and fermented figs in the aft.  Medium-plus bodied and lively carbonated, this brew finishes on the dry side.  Overall, a decent example of the style, but I tend to dig a fuller, bolder, less sour Weizen Bock.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Aroma of chocolate, vinous notes and slight wheat in the back ground. Thin watery mouthfeel with slight stingy carbonation that dances around on the back of my throat. Flavor starts off with lots of vinegar and vinous qualities but moves onto a slight bitersweet chocolate that turns into total chocolate on the aftertaste.

Bursting with sharp clove flavor and given to  heavy bubblegum sweetness with hints of seared purple onions, balsamic reduction, and powdery pepper.  Carbonation seems a bit reckless and impossible to restrain; medium bodied and irreparably sharp in the mouth.  Faint chocolate and hazelnut precede another whisk of brisk spice in the finish   .  The elements are definitely in place, but the final impression is lacking in some indescribeable way.

The aroma is fairly spicy, like one would expect from a weizen bock (I was immediately reminded of Aventinus). But strangely, the quality of the taste/palate was altogether different.

I got yeasty notes of banana and bubblegum next to dried fruits, a distinct Dr Pepper flavour, tobacco, black chocolate, distant berries (including blueberries!?) and a light roastiness.  Thats a lot of individual flavour elements but the beer doesnt feel all-over-the-place.  Many different spices too with black pepper being the dominant one.  Peppery hops finish.  Carbonation is too soft and thats too bad.  The body feels full yet kind of watery but thats probably because of the lacking carbonation.

There are so many flavors in this beer and they work so well with each other:  tastes of carmel, apple, malt, roast, little banana, and sweet fruit which is balanced by a smoky, but subtle finish.  I really had no idea what to expect when I bought this beer, but it was well worth it.  I think if this beer had more name recognition or wider distribution it would be rated higher.  I would recommend giving this beer a try.","Pennsylvania, USA","johnykat"
3753,"2007-03-17",3.8,"Smokey, roasted, fruity, chocolatey taste with a deep burgandy-brownish-black coloring.  Slight head and nicely done natural carbonation.  Doesnt taste much like a wheat beer, however it is very similar to Aventinus.  Ill give the nod to Ramstein for overall flavor and drinkability.  Alcohol is very well hidden within the malty taste.  Since the hops are pretty well buried, theres no real aftertaste to speak of........which makes it easy to drink another!  An excellent brew.","New Jersey, USA","HoppityHop"

Pours a dark, cloudy brown appearance; significant, light-tan head with great structure and retention - until it slowly disappears to almost nothing.  Lots of chewy banana bread and cloves in the aroma; hints of spiced nuts.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: malt-driven, chewy nougat and caramel character upfront, lots of bread and clove and yeast; hints of a citrus hoppiness underneath all that.  Medium finish, showing milk chocolate and a chalky dryness.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"

3753,"2007-01-29",4.6,"A: Im probably too much of a n00b to discern the difference, but this Weizenbock looks near-identical to all quality stouts Ive had. Which is to say, solidly black, with very little dark cream head and minimal lacing, if at all. Appealing at the very least.

S: At first you wonder where the aroma of this beer is at all, but a couple of good solid deep inhales reveal a tasteful, sweet scent beneath the obvious dessert flavors. The more I smell it, the better it gets, like a fresh piece of pie. Its fantastic.

T: Im not sure I can even review this beer unbiasedly (is that a word?), because its absolutely one of my favorites. Its uncharacteristically smooth for such a big beer, lots of bready, malted flavors. Every mouthful of this beer rewards with big flavors of mild milk chocolate, banana cream pie (I swear!), malted sugars and more. Its amazing.

M: So chewy, and so delicious, like a piece of white bread that has been sitting in a sugary chocolate concoction for the past 2 weeks. I almost want to freeze this and eat it with a spoon.

D: I only knocked this down a peg because its 9.50% ABV and it kicks my tail all over the room. Too bad because I often want to drink about 12 of them in a sitting. VERY drinkable, dangerously so.

Flavor is buttery smooth black wheat, with clove, more banana, yeast and an interesting bell pepper addition. Slightly soured finish, probably due to the age of the bottle, though that isnt indicated anywhere on the packaging, tisk tisk. Fantastic retention, I can rouse up a good head with a light swirl.

2004 bottling
Pours a mysterious stormy night black body with some crimson edges.  The head, a dark hue of tan, stands fine bubbled and tall. The aroma is a fruitcake of pit fruits and sweet breads, sweet breads as in the compound of grains, not the cooked innards of a wild animal. The flavor brings out beautiful contributions of raisins, coco, dates, fig, wild red cherries, toffee, vanilla, almond extracts This beer is amazingly complex and worthy of reflection!  This beer reminds me of a local desert Ive had a few times, Cognac Flambéd Banana Truffle the charred chocolaty crust overtop the sweet caramelized banana, surrounded by the sweet oaky bourbon like suggestions of Cognac.

3753,"2005-12-28",4.0,"As I pours this dark brew a fresh aroma of banana bread wafts to my nose.  The beer is topped by a frothy, one-finger thick, brown colored head that sits atop a dark, purplish-brown colored beer that might be more aptly described as black.  The aroma is fresh, with a nice wheat tartness, definite notes of clove, and a sweet plum like fruitiness.  As the beer warms it begins to pick up a soft note reminiscent of chocolate and a hint of roasted coffee beans.

The taste has a definite sweetness up front, but it is soft and reminds me of a just ripe plum.  As this beer moves to the finish it picks up tart wheat notes and a nice hint of coffee and roast grain.  The roasted note is what really lingers here, like a slightly astringent, burnt barley husk.  There is some spicy clove notes here as well as a hint of banana like notes.  This beer really has a nice fruit character to it; along with the sweet plum notes I also get notes of raisins, and notes reminiscent of fresh figs.  I really like how this seems to be light on the palate, yet still has a mouthcoating richness to it.  It is definitely not a light beer, but there is something about the creamy smoothness of this beer which gives it that sort of feel.

This beer is definitely quite nice, it strikes a good balance between rich flavors of fruit, spice and roast and still being quite quaffable.  The only drawback here is a slight, burnt grain astringency in the finish, and this is fairly subtle.

Holy Sh!#, I just looked at the alcohol content.  One thing I have got to say for this beer, I would never have guessed it was anywhere near 9% alcohol; it really hides it quite well.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

3753,"2005-11-09",4.3,"What an incredible story about this beer: For some reason that I cant even remember now, I placed this beer on my want list nearly 2 years ago. During that time I neither saw  or heard of the beer again thereafter. So imagine my suprise when my great friend Jeremy (jgb9348) found this beer for me, and even more amazing, got it for FREE. He was on a roadtrip in New England and found this at a store. The keeper said the beer had been there forever and that he wouldnt feel right charging Jer for it. So opening the bottle I had no idea what to expect. It pours the darkest black you will find for any beer of this style, and really for a stout I would consider this maximum dark. No light can penetrate. As one would expect from a beer with some age, there wasnt much of a head but with a hard pour I was able to get a decent one to show, with tan khaki bubbles and about 1/4 inch thickness. If the glass is moved at all, bubbles are generated and lace the glass with a dark brown color. Aroma is gorgeous with rich malt, blackberries,  blueberries, chocolate and roasted hops.Taste is amazing, showing a myriad of flavors, and really more appropriate for a sweet stout. Mouthfeel is medium thick, somewhat oily, and with perfect carbonation. Flavors include sweet berries, sweet/bitter chocolate, caramel, fruits (apple/pear). Aftertaste is warming alcohol, drying anise, wheat/oatmeal and blueberries. The dark fruits/berries are what really make me appreciative this beer. Very good, I cant even imagine how good it would be if it were a bit younger.","Cochabamba, BOLIVIA","JonR888710"
3753,"2005-10-14",4.1,"Courtesy of Mullman in trade. Pours murky dark brown with tiny sediment floaties, with no head. Aroma is chewy roasted malt, dark fruits and clove. Flavor is all over the place. Toffee, caramel, roasted grain, dark fruits, tiny bit of chocolate, and some yeasty bread. Great chewy, slightly oily palate. Looking at the glass it has residuel film coated everywhere. Alcohol is hidden better than any beer Ive had I believe. Very well done.","Lincoln Park, Michigan, USA","Styles"

A tasty brew.","Noblesville, Indiana, USA","MI2CA"
3753,"2005-09-21",3.8,"(12 oz bottle: Obtained in trade with MullMan, thanks Joe!) This is a winter wheat?  It pours as dark as a frickin porter!  But something bizarre has happened to this beer in just a few minutes.  Yeasties have now coagulated into hundreds of sizeable tan blobs, and they are suspended throughout the beer like a lab experiment in high school chemistry.  They are slowly settling to the bottom, but this is the craziest thing Ive ever seen with a beer.  Its cool to look at, but its also freaking me out a little.  It is so dense with this stuff that the carbonation bubbles are having a tough time weaving through the maze as they attempt to reach the surface.  It reminds me of a beer that is slightly frozen that its a slushee.  Anyway, the beer tastes and smells fine.  Well, actually, its better than fine, its great!  Sweet, loads of blackstrap molasses, strong dark malts and chocolate, dark fruits like prunes, very yeasty taste, kind of milky, and a fair amount of smoke on the back end.  Theres some wheat flavor here, but its kind of blotted out by the dark roasty malts.  As the beer warms, it tastes more and more like chocolate milk.  The nose is mostly roast, sweet chocolate and yeast.  Full bodied and dense, but not syrupy.  The mouthfeel is like someone added a thickening agent to my beer.  Dark brown color, obviously very cloudy and nearly opaque.  The small tan head didnt seem to last very long, but I was so enthralled the yeast blobs, I missed noting the head retention.  And interestingly enough, over time, all those yeast blobs have broken up, perhaps because the beer has warmed, or perhaps for some other reason, but with all that yeast ""dissolved"" into the liquid, it now has a milky appearance.  And the bottom of the bottle looks like Hersheys Syrup.  I gotta say, this is one of the most unique beer experiences of my rating career.  But I probably spent too much time on all the oddities, when I should have been enjoying the flavor, and make no mistake, this was a tasty brew, even it was a bit ""darker"" in flavor than authentic Weizen Bocks.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

There was no pop, no fizz and it poured with no head.  But, it did pour much darker than I had anticipated.  The aroma was light, some cloves, some grapes and pretty sweet.  At first sip, the flavor was pretty spicy (corriander and clove) and very vinous and astringent.  Grape and sweet malt presented itself as it warmed and the alcohol began to sit up.  It finishes dry and astringent.  My feeling is that the bottle wasnt infected, just oxidized.  Ill have to go back and rerate this one, probably in the winter months.

3753,"2005-05-15",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 7, 2008 Once again, kudos for Richlikebeer for this bottle which was very fresh and up to date. My response to this beer is ""interesting."" I detected black currant and a raison-like taste (could be a combo fo flavors interacting there). It seems spicy but a bit malty for a wheat lover like myself. The mix kind of put my head in a twirl, not that the high alcohol content struck me.  It looks good and the mouthfeel is awesome. The aroma wasnt very evident to me after I drank it. Before I drank it, it made me wonder where my taste buds were travelling to. I may have to try this again to see if I can acquire its taste.
Rerate: I was on drugs when I gave this a 3.2! The mix of wheats and cloves and chocolate make this a nice malty liquid treat. Think Schneider Aventinus with some extra spices and chocolate malts. But still a bit soapy and soda pop feel.","East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","JFURYCAT"

3753,"2005-02-24",3.9,"2004 bottle, second batch of the season, in an awesome trade with Maibockaddict.  Fabulous dark, caramel-brown color, muddy consistency, with plenty of sediment in the bottle.  Peppery carbonation at first, but allowing it to breath quickly solves that problem.  Tan head, lasting and lace-creating.  Aroma of clove cigarettes, banana, dark berries and light German hops.  Smells more like a hefe-weisse at first, but as it warms up and breathes more, some of the sweet caramel and raisin aroma is released.Flavor starts out with a rich toffee and caramel flavor, which is only lightly sweet.  Quickly transitions in to a more rounded wheat, sugar and chocolate mix with notes of ash and dry berry-skins as it finishes.  The more I drink, the more a distinct black currant flavor creeps in on my palate.  Towards the end of the bottle, I am marveling at how distinct, yet subtle it is.  Adds a light bitterness and slight astringency, which does not hurt the beer, but also adds a wondrous flavor.  I laughed when I read the commercial description, highly skeptical that there would be any real black currant flavor, but here it is.  Light clove and apple notes keep the sugars in check, while a faint dark chocolate adds great complexity.  Medium body and maybe a bit too much dryness  could be its only downfall, but I havent tried the other batch yet.  I cant detect the alcohol.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The fruit character is just splendid, chewy plums and fresh black berries. This is a garden Id like to possess.

3753,"2003-08-11",3.5,"2002? bottle. Head is initially small, frothy, brown, fully diminishing. Body is black (almost opaque), bottle conditioned. Aroma is lightly malty (caramel, toasted dark bread), lightly yeasty (cobwebs), with light notes of banana, clove, and dark brown sugar, hint of raisin. Flavor is heavily sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter. Medium to full body, watery/syrupy texture, lively carbonation. I think this is the '02 version, but the brewer doesn't mark the bottling year unfortunately.  The aroma is perhaps a little TOO subtle, but what is there is pleasant. The flavor profile is too syrupy sweet, but definitely rich. Overall I wouldn't call this world class. It's certainly no Aventinus.  But it's still quite good.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"

Still hides its alcohol well, but isnt quite as to style as the past version.  Many thanks to richlikebeer for the chance to try this again.

Compared to Aventinus, the Weizenbock style standard imho, this one is somewhat less effervescent, leans towards the bock more than the weizen, and thus possesses a fuller malt body and richer malt profile. I might prefer Aventinus for its heavily estery personality, and Belgian-like vivacity, but Ramsteins would be a better late-evening sipper than Aventinus. Both excellent beers, any way you like at them.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
