3971,"2016-12-31",3.5,"Bottle sample- pours a very dark chocolate colour with slight beige head. Nose- piney, chocolate, bourbon. Taste- initially get that black ipa character but hops quite muted. then comes sweet vanilla, toasted oak, faint star anise. Moderate body with boozy finish. very complex and not too sweet given the maple syrup barrel aging treatment. I likely would enjoy this more fresh to get the interplay of the hops and the barrel but still tasty with some age on it.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","oakbluff"

The palate is well carbonated and full bodied. Latte-like forward flavors with notes of maple syrup, vanilla, and a slight mint-like spiciness and a light hoppy bitterness on the finish.

Pronounced malt and maple on front, transitioning to flavors of slightly bitter, oak, coffee, chocolate. The sweet and bitter keeps it rounded and being a black ipa and not a stout brings different, less heavy mouthfeel. Different than expected. Id love more, better than kbs, but not quite cbs.

3971,"2016-04-14",3.8,"750 ml bottle for a steep price of $17.99. (the sticker was still on the bottle but I dont remember where I purchased it) Pitch black in color, lasting tan head with lacing. Aroma is layers of pine, chocolate, wood and burnt maple syrup. Even after sitting it shows quite a bit of strong pine. 
Flavor also reflects the bold pine that states; I am a black IPA, deal with it. Also shows maple syrup, burnt sugar, roast malts, and oak. The strong pine fights the sweet, bold stout like qualities. Alcohol level is mostly hidden in a thick / full body.

3971,"2016-03-20",4.1,"My Bottom Line:
This unique strong ale delights with a maple syrup signature deepening the relation between roasted malts and coniferous hops.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam sticks to the hazy deep brown.
-The sweetness has tons of personality, and it is perfectly balanced out by the chosen hops.
-I could easily see myself on a cool evening enjoying this near a campfire in the forest.
-This is a creative brew that showcases not only the brewers talent in the brewhouse, but also his sense of harmony.

3971,"2016-03-17",4.2,"Black pour with a frothy beige head. Aroma was a wonderful mix of piney hops, roasted malt, bourbon, vanilla and oak. Wild stuff. Flavors were oaky with lots of pine like, dank hops, more vanilla, big roasty malts, touch of sweetened coffee. Viscous mouthfeel with moderate carbonation, slick and oily. Slightly bittersweet finish. This came across almost as a big black hoppy barleywine. Similar to that SN a few years ago.

Had heard about this ever since Founders came to Southern California over the past few months, but had never seen it in stores or on tap. I knew of a few places that had the bottles, but they sold out quick. Luckily, my sister-in-law heard my wife talking about Founders and picked up the last two (hidden in the back) at Whole Foods in Manhattan Beach. I guess I never really saw what this actually was, but a black IPA aged in maple syrup bourbon barrels soundsinteresting?

Poured a dark brown, dark mahogany color with 3-to-4 fingers of khaki-tan, frothy head. Minimal wet spotty lacing. Below average retention. (Sight - 4.00)

Smelled a funky mix of hops and bourbon. Initially digging it. Can only point out Chinook but seem to be much more in there in terms of hops. Also got maple syrup, hints of molasses, licorice, oaky bourbon, caramel, toffee, slight booziness, butter pecan, creamy maple walnut ice cream, brown sugar and hazelnut. Interesting, but I like it. (Smell - 4.25)

Taste wasnt quite as good, but I got more definitive hops here. For hops I got Nugget, Dorado and Chinook. For the other stuff I got maple syrup, licorice, dark fruits - grape, plum and blackberries - molasses, toasted brown sugar, oaky bourbon, sugary caramel, sticky toffee, maple walnut ice cream and candied walnuts. (Taste - 3.75)

Medium body. Sticky texture. Lively carbonation. Long, boozy finish. (Feel - 4.00)

This was one of the most interesting beers Ive ever had. Still not sure if I liked it, loved it, properly rated it, overrated it or underrated it. (Taste - 4.00)

Flavors include (in no particular order): oak, bourbon, maple syrup, vanilla, toffee, cocoa, toasted coconut, raisins, dates, molasses. Since not a barrel-aged stout, the mouthfeel is not chewy, therefore easily quaffable. This black IPA is expertly balanced between sweet and bitter. The lingering prickly flavors from the six-hop flavor profile perfectly counter the forefront sweetness. Founders is an impressive brewery.

There is a light bitterness on the finish that conflicts with the sweet maple and malts. The flavor is a little messy. There is a sweet maple up front that blends well with a sweet malt before the bitterness hits. When it does toll through, it's almost out of place.

3971,"2015-12-22",3.2,"Location: 750 ml bottle from Hoboken Vine, 12/22/15


Aroma: The aroma is heavy on the bourbon, oak, and vanilla, didnt get much hop or maple syrup

Appearance: Pours a dark brown color with a creamy tan head and medium-heavy lace

Flavor: Flavor also comes through on the boozier and sweeter side of bourbon barrel beers

Palate: The body is fairly full, soft carbonation, a somewhat sticky feel, and a good bit of heat 

Overall Impression: 
Yeah, so first off theres nothing IPA about this beer, black or not.  I get that it spent some time in a barrel, but I dont even get old IPA hops here.  The alcohol and the barrel flavors in general dominated whatever lies underneath. Bit too hot right now as well. I would say this could use some time to mellow, but you cant mellow everything else while adding hops back...  

As I get closer to the end of the bottle and it warms to room temperature the maple comes out a bit and the heat fades a bit.  Its still lacking in hops and balance though, and the aroma is still overrun by the bourbon.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

3971,"2015-12-02",4.7,"Snifter. Aroma is hops, chocolate, and maple syrup, taste is sweet, but not nearly as sweet as other maple barrel aged beers, the hops balance this out much better! Heaven in a glass.","grand rapids, Michigan, USA","njager246"

Dark malts, coconut, dark chocolate, light bitter coffee grounds. Light lingering bourbon with a touch of maple and mint. Medium to full body. Somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Really good.

3971,"2015-11-30",4.1,"750ml bottle from BrookFalls - fresh. Whiskey. Caramel. Some citrus and maple syrup. Not as much of the ""ipa"" part in the flavor blend; the dark malts show mostly with the vanilla and the maple constantly peeking through. This likely should be aged as an impy stout, not drank fresh for the hop presence. Now to find another to cellar .... 15.8","Wisconsin, USA","AWISLguy"

3971,"2015-11-27",4.5,"There are evident similarities to CBS and where I thought the sweetness overpowered CBS this much hoppier roastier beer works much better. This beer is sweet. Very very sweet. On a level where the malty sweetness and the almost artificial swetness from the maple syrup mix together. Its a little blurry tasting. Like theres a lot going on. It doesnt make it bad, becaus everything it tries to do, it does so well.","","malkyore"

Bourbon and sweet maple syrup flavors with pine, vanilla, roasted malt, oak. Full body with moderate carbonation and a slick mouthfeel. Really nice.","Winter Springs, Florida, USA","smith4498"
3971,"2015-11-26",4.1,"The beer pours very dark with a good sized dense tab head. The aroma has herbal/piney hops, roasted malt, dark caramel, molasses, mild oak, sweetness and some bourbon. It has a medium/ full body with lots of fairly soft carbonation. The flavor starts with some roast, woody/piney/ herbal/citrus hops, raw oak, mild bourbon and traces of vanilla. The finish is pretty dry and shows a touch of maple. As it warms there is more vanilla, coconut, maple and bourbon barrel notes.  Somehow it masked the high alcohol very well.  Really nice","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
3971,"2015-11-26",4.4,"Bottle: The aroma moderate chocolate, lighter bourbon,coconut, maple syrup, vanilla, a hint of oak, and maybe some pine. It pours a dark brown with some faint orange highlights. It has a large beige head that settles to a thick soapy film. There is some spotty lacing left on the sides of the glass. The flavor starts with moderate chocolate with a touch of caramel. There is some faint roast in the back ground. The finish has bourbon, lighter maple syrup, coconut, vanilla, faint pine, and a touch of oak. Its medium bodied with mild carbonation. Im really digging this. This is probably the second best Backstage Series after CBS.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
