Nice spotty soapy lacing clings down the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Awesome appearance.

Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roast/bready malt and earthy hop notes; with great strength.

Outstanding complexity, robustness, and balance of roast/bready malt and earthy hop flavors; with a great roast/hop bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from roast and hop bitterness as well. Medium-high carbonation and medium body; with a very smooth, crisp, moderately creamy/bready, and sticky/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is nice.

Touch of spruce and general wood, light but very noble in the hop department, more dark bread with a light vein of caramel. Relatively dry when its all said and done, minimal alcohol and very crisp.  Its missing a deep malty center but is definitely what I call ""hard bop"" in its uncompromised, somewhat acrid roast and long aftertaste.

1374,"2015-12-08",4.1,"BB date of March 2016.
This was poured into a pilsener glass.
The appearance was a dark brown color with a rocky off white to almond two finger head. Lacing was semi-sticky and coating the glass somewhat in a glaze of rings.
The smell takes in roasted nuts, (I almost want to say almonds) with a subtle dry roasted cocoa beans. Light cake-like aroma to level out the aroma.
The taste was balanced between the sweet and the dry roastiness. Nuts, almonds, caramel, toffee and cocoa round out to warm on into the aftertaste. Theres a slight sticky finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a sessionability that makes me want to sip. Im sipping a lager, why yes I am. Damn right and you know, I realize theres nothing wrong with that.

The taste is some dark berries. There is a charcoal flavor, and a touch of leather. Just a touch of sugary black licorice. 

Feels very chalky and dry. This is a very nice dark lager. Reminds me of a smoky Schwartzbier.","Syracuse, New York, USA","williamherbert"

1374,"2015-11-04",3.5,"Bottle shared that pours a medium brown with long lasting tan head and decent lacing, in the nose you get roasted malts pils malt slight bitterness and hops. The flavor produced more of the same a good lager base with the pils malt but the extra layer of the roasted malts is actually quite good and does not over power other flavors. Strange style to begin with but still quite tasty.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","tmongoose"
