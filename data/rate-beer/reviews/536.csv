Delving deep in the cellar I came across this and decided to share it one evening. The bottle called it ""Rauch Geek"" but it was fairly apparent what to expect based on Mikkellers reputation. This one hits a home run and its only drawback is that it might break the budget to keep too much around.

Aroma / Appearance - A fluid black base builds from waves of icy legs. Smoky bacon bits, coffee, and dry bitterness engulf the air as if you were walking into a diner during the peak of breakfast. Dark fruits underscore the richness.

Flavor / Palate - Malty coffee, bacon soaked in ash, and more meatiness than any beer has the right to possess dominate the profile. The richness permeates the palate so well that it takes a long time to fade. If you are tired of super high gravity offerings or experimental sours track down a Beer Geek and find out for yourself why they remain one of the best in the world.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Aroma is intensely smokey even when cold. Notes of bacon, peat, roast beef, pork sausages, Wagyu jerky and beechwood. Secondary notes come from coffee, tabacco, cigar smoke, licorice and pure cacao. Smokiness dominates and overwhelms the rest though it still smells somewhat stouty. After warming, you get more coffee character. Fantastic! Taste is strong, bold and powerfully smokey. Roasty bitterness, with sweetness attenuated and replaced by loads of burnt flavors. Quite a lot of coffee flavors towards the finish. Some cacao and dark bitter chocolate nuances. Not extremely complex, but two-faced and characterful with the smoke-coffee combination. Smooth, creamy texture, big body. The oats are clear in the mouthfeel. Smokey aftertaste as its logical.

Rich and complex with hops definitely playing a key role here. The rich maltiness is balanced by it to give a rather bitter impression without being overly roasty. Malty side is more focused on smokiness, which in turn also is not overpowering, but soft. Easy drinking and well attenuated. The strange phenolish character is present also, may come from strange hops selection. Gives Demänovka impression, which is not something all would appreciate, but I do.

536,"2014-07-03",4.0,"Dark brown, almost black color, with a small beige-brown head. Aromas contain a lot of fresh crushed coffee beans, sweeter malts, bitter chocolate, cream and a decent amount of smoke.

Taste is defined by a solid bready malt foundation, which gets washed over by a creamy, smooth coffee bitterness. Malts then stay recognizable by turning a bit sweeter, giving the beer a fuller body. Medium carbonation is responsible for the coffee to rush down the throat rapidly, while leaving a trace of smoky, roasted bitterness on the palate. This beer is defined by an interesting interplay of very bitter coffee and smoked, toffeeish malts, finished by a long acrid finish. Smoke actually doesnt have the biggest influence on the palate, but it is recognizable in an enjoyable interaction with the malts, adding an unusal flavor to this great beer. Arguing from the perspective of loving a typical Bamberg smoked beer, this smoked stout entirely lacks the characteristic hints of saltiness. It is even more astonishing that it doesnt need those, because of the complex coffee flavor, which stays in balance due to the malty smokiness - enough complexity is established in a different way, than they do it in Bamberg. The coffee flavor of this beer might already be enough to make this great, as it is very smooth, almost creamy, intense flavoured, and changes its taste on the palate during the tasting process.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Later it becomes more dark malty, coffee, turfy, sweeter. Taste is light sweet with heavy bitter, dominant roast, coffee bitter, with elegant herbal tiny hops bite at the end. Aftertaste is gentle herbal hoppy. Interesting flavor, although not the best smoked I have tasted. Seems overloaded with dark malts, more reminds kind of stout/black ipa, just more bodied. So medium to full body, thick texture, soft carbonation, long lasting, bitter finish. Interesting brew cause of mix of many ingredients, but still flavor is too heavy bitter - it ruins other compounds.","Ogre, LATVIA","zenkis"

A rich oatmeal sweetness, lots of roasty malts, then a big punch of smoke that lingers on the palate until forever.

536,"2014-02-02",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 18, 2014 Bottle:  ""Rauch Geek Breakfast"". Black body, with only a mild trace of dark brown outlining the edges; topped with a leathery tan head, creamy & slow to dissipate completely. Aroma have obvious smoke, with a mild peat & meaty aspect, a little like cooked sausage (or bacon, I guess). Faint wood chips with a mild, underlying sweetness, a hint of bitter cocoa beans, & some burnt, roasted malt in the finish. The tastes takes on more of a charred, campfire-like smoke presence with a balancing dark chocolate sweetness. Roasted malts & burnt wood play a big role, leading into a lingering smoky & black coffee ground finish. Smooth, slick body, coats the palate in the aftertaste.

536,"2014-01-18",2.3,"Bottle.

Head is initially average sized, frothy, light brown, mostly lasting.
Body is opaque black (flashlight tested).

Aroma is moderately malty (roasted/burnt grain, stale/sour coffee grounds, chocolate), lightly hoppy (grapefruit, resin), with notes of red onion, lemon juice, and compost.

Flavor is moderately to heavily sweet, moderately to heavily acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, moderately to heavily acidic, moderately to heavily bitter, unclean.

Medium body, watery texture, lively carbonation, lightly to moderately alcoholic.

Quite frankly, this is horrid. Ive never understood the mass hysteria for Mikkeller products in general, but theyre usually at least average or so in quality. Not so here. This is acrid, dirty, and very sour. Smells a lot like compost/garbage with stale coffee grounds and onions featuring prominently in that heap of muck, all saturated with a liberal dose of lemon juice. And it should be no surprise that its just as unpleasant in the mouth as that sounds.

Aroma is very smoked, almost meaty :D You get some of the coffee and roasted characters too. Maybe a slight hint of sweet chocolate - but without a doubt - the thing you remember from this is the smoke and meat feel.
Taste is dominated just as much by smoke and meat flavors. It almost has this sour feel to it due to the intensity from these. Coffee is also present along with roasted characters as well.
Mouthfeel is not that big. A little on the bigger side of medium, and not that dry - rather smooth. I dont really feel the oatmeal, maybe it adds a faded sweetness to it, but not that much.

This beer appears a deep shade of black, with hints of brown only detectable at the crest when held up to the light. The beige head is surprisingly small and recedes quite rapidly, leaving only faint traces of lacing.

The beer has a nice flavor, with roasted and burnt malt taking center stage. The smoke flavor is a welcome addition, and integrated nicely. The body is medium-thin.

Taste of big dark chocolate, burnt wood, smoke, caramel, roasted malt, coffee, molasses, and herbal hops.  Light bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of chocolate, smoke, caramel, coffee, and roasted malt on the finish for a bit.  Nice balance of flavors without being too smokey.

The smoke flavor on the back of the palate that drifts up and overwhelms your senses is a bit much.  Far smokier than expected...even with a name like bacon.  The coffee flavors get lost mostly, offering some nice bitterness, but being overwhelmed by the smoke.  I think in their effort to go big, this got outta control.  Im usually okay with such things, but this doesnt really work.  Def. does not have the taste of fake / liquid smoke like some in this style.

536,"2012-03-01",3.3,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/20/2011.  Served on tap at Firkin in a snifter.

The appearance is pitch black all the way through. A creamy beige head arrives intact and slowly fades to a ring. Spots of lace decorate the glass.

Tons of smoke and tobacco, lots of espresso, both of which almost squeeze the roasted malt out of the aroma. A bit of dark fruits as it warms. My nose actually gets the sensation of cigarette smoke rising into it.

Roasted malt is the main flavor up front, quite dry, with almost no sweetness. A boiled off molasses taste, then tobacco and smoke. Lots of espresso throughout the sip. The finish is smokey with more espresso. A little too much smoke; I feel like I just smoked a cigarette while drinking a dopio espresso.

The mouthfeel is creamy, slightly drying, and medium carbonation. Full body.

536,"2011-09-26",4.2,"I poured a 500ml bottle into a tulip glass.Appearance: By far one of the blackest beers Ive ever seen. So dark this beer seems to eat light. Forms one of the darkest heads Ive ever seen: dark brown froth with tight density. Very good lacing and retention.Smell: The rauchbier component is very prominent in the nose with a lightly smoky, woody, almost permanent marker-like aroma. Bitter dark chocolate and deeply roasted malts are also quite strong - indicating this is going to be a robust stout.Taste: Smoked malts are generally used for lighter ales and lagers, but making a stout out of a rauchbier is unheard of. But then again, brewing unique, eccentric beers is what Mikkeller is known for and the Beer Geek Bacon is a good example of that. The first half of the palate is very traditional in the strong stout style. Sweet with a light chocolate milk/oatmeal taste. Then the beer changes on a dime into a smoky, dry, almost woody flavor. Reminds me of the smell of a carpenters shop of pine or balsa wood being heated. It transitions into a bitter dark chocolate taste - all of which blends very well together. It doesnt really taste like bacon per se, but the smokiness is enough to remind you of breakfast while camping. The aftertaste is of roasted malts and slightly dry, but never obnoxious.Mouthfeel: Thick, but not syrupy or overtly viscous. One of the softest, most comfortable beers I can recall - it nuzzles the tongue and throat all the way down. No alcohol presence whatsoever.Drinkability: The first few swigs of Mikkeller Beer Geek Bacon took some getting used to, but once I did it was smooth sailing all the way. The tasty palate and silky smooth texture combined with almost non-existent carbonation make this beer surprisingly quaffable. Im actually impressed so much could be done with 7.5% ABV and I cant help but think this could be brewed even stronger for more flavor without turning it into a sipper.Overall, this is a very interesting and fun beer to drink. Its a little pricey and hard to find, but I dont think youll be disappointed at all.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

536,"2011-08-15",3.6,"My Bottom Line :  
Phenolic, saline peat smoke nose sticks to roasted malts throughout this Smoked Stout, an intense flavor profile alleviated somewhat by fruitiness and excited effervescence. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A healthy head of foam tops the blackness. 
-Coffee flavors are found within the peat and straight roastiness.
-The frothy carbonation and residual sugars dont gel. Mouthfeel needs some tightening up. 
-The body is not too heavy, not too lean, quite drinkable. The same mouthfeel can be gotten from a 5% brew though...
-This is not as engaging as the ""regular"" Beer Geek Breakfast, imho.
-The potent roasted, peaty, hoppy bitterness becomes soy sauce-like in the aftertaste.

Almost black, its head is tan and enormous. Even the foam translates those odours as the mouth conveys slightly vegetal dark chocolate on top of it. Extremely tasty and exactly the flavours youd expect the concept to deliver. At the same time. not very complex, with almost no fruity complexities, but perhaps they would not really fit the ensemble. While it already does not feel very sweet with all that roast, the intense medium-bubbled carbonation, while not too biting, removes any sugar trace and may diminish the depth, making the focus geared towards roast. Not very diplomatic, but it knows what it wants and its a flavour profile I sometimes feel like having. Solid.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a dark, opaque black with a large, light brown head that mostly diminished, but kept a thick sheet and lft fair to good lacing. The aroma had light to moderate roasted malts, chocolate and coffee; light to moderate pine hops; smoked gouda; smoke: tar; burnt plastic; electrical fire and a little smoked meat. The initial flavor was light to somewhat sweet and lightly bitter; while the finish was somewhat to moderately sweet and moderately bitter with a long duration. There was chocolate, roasted malt, smoke, slight hops, oat, coffee, slight burnt plastic or electrical fire, a little caramel, and slight smoked meat and cheese (like smoke gouda).

I can see why they called this Beer Geek Bacon (my bottle said Rauch Geek Breakfast), the flavor reminds me a little of really smoky bacon that has been cooked a little longer than necessary. But what would be a burnt flavor for bacon works to this beers favor. My only complaint is that the body is a little thin, but the huge flavor largely makes up for it. Hard to pair with food, this seems like something to drink after dinner, even smoked meat could be overwhelmed by it.

536,"2011-05-29",4.0,"Bottle, fresh batch.  Labeled as ""Rauch Geek Breakfast"".  Served at cellar temperature.
Pours black with a large four finger brown head that holds up very well, eventually recedes to a good cap and leaves sheets of lacing behind.

Aroma is pretty intense smoke, a lot of ham, bacon and meat as well as a strong peat and campfire/charred wood/charcoal presence.  Even a bit of tire smoke from a burnout.  Interesting.  The smoke ultimately hides any of the coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt characteristics of the base beer.  Very good to excellent strength.

Flavor pretty much mirrors the nose, smoked meats, peat, campfire, charcoal and a hint of tire smoke.  The coffee and chocolate are more pronounced in the flavor, coming along in the finish, but the smoke still dominates.

Mouthfeel is medium-plus, creamy and smooth, medium, sometimes prickly carbonation.

Ive been venturing further into smoked beers and this one certainly doesnt disappoint in that aspect and is a unique take on the Beer Geek family.  However, the tire burnout aroma and taste are a bit off-putting but luckily it is a minor aspect of an otherwise fantastic brew.","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"

The flavor is subtle smoke and salted bacon on the front end (I swear, Im getting the lightest note of mint in there somewhere as well), with smoke becoming more pronounced through the middle.  This leads to bitter cocoa and caramel, red berry, and a charcoal/burnt meat finish.  Creamy, low carbonation, medium to full body, and dry.

Did I just smell old fashion  1980s arousal bug spray? Ugg, ACK, splaaaa!!! What did I just put in my mouth? So very oily tasting and feeling. I can taste burnt charcoal bacon that has absorbed all the fat in the frying pan but then that fell into my cup of yummy coffee. So I really dig the thick coffee flavor here but his oily tar like camp fire smoke isnt doing it for me. Strange Im not sure what to think, the coffee base is good, I think I can even handle the smoke, but this pungent oil/tar mixed with ash is killing this beer for me.

536,"2011-05-03",4.2,"holy fuck. thisll be my first post of a beer in quite possibly years. thanks to vertical bacon strips for this, and previous tastings of cellared and stellar, beers.

pouring into la fin du monde glass. first portion of the pour reveals an actual thick and meaty beer. likely im part to the ridiculous cap that follows. erp. theres a bit of chunky goodness that slops into the dense, tan cap. i take my time with this pour, to get almost all of the 50cl into the glass. even with a careful pour, the inverted nipple on a b-cup head (in proportion of glass opening of course) makes my dink-hole smile. im giggling like a school boy just looking at the beer.

i take a first taste just to make room for the last 2cl or so. beer is still a bit chilled, but i immediately taste the smoke. finishing off the pour, gives me a satisfaction as i see the crater in the middle of the cap.

i wait while the beer warms, and keep admiring the looks of the beer. a dense black body, with a deep tan cap that sticks. and sticks. and sticks. and keeps on sticking. thick cap just wont dissipate! once it eventually relaxes, it leaves a concavity that shows just how much it wants to stick to the glass.

the first smells at a cooler temp do reveal smoke and roasty goodness. gunna leave it for a bit.

more tastes once it gets to about 6 degrees im guessing, and i get a more intense smoke. not as much as i expected, but still better. i wait a couple more dozen minutes.

been a good chunk of airing now. with a quick smell, im immediately faced with blackened wood smell. but also reminds me of a meat chunk in my bbq that dropped into the flames 2 cookings ago, and is finally melting its buttery burnt smell into my nostrils and impregnating my present feast. after a swirl and more calm smell gives a similar creamery salted butter smell. definitely roasted coffee and slightly burnt chocolate smell up front. but also... raw prosciutto actually. very slight smokey saltiness. as i type this, i can smell the smoke sneaking its way to my face.

during this time, ive had more tastes. a light sweetness with mild bitterness. not as much as i expected. not sure what i was expecting, but the balance is nice. this compliments a creamy, full body mouthfeel. the mealiness of the beer now compliments the dense cap. but the mealiness isnt shunned. not a beer youre going to drink anything but slow, so its all gooood. no discernible aftertaste other than a slight smokiness that leaves the palate ready for another sip.

as i finish off this review, im taking a few last sips, and im pleased with this review. this is a great beer, and im thoroughly enjoying it. the ""meat"" of the beer and possible ""mealiness"" i got out of it was more apparent at optimal serving temps. following, left a well balanced and very palatable beer for a deep impy stout. think ill take me up on that! thanks to vertical bacon strips again!","British Columbia, CANADA","XaenDovet"

Nose is big fudgy chocolate, combined with (unsurprisingly) a huge smoke component. This strikes me as more of a cured ham aroma than a fresh bacon one, but the smoke component is lovely nonetheless. Flavours are much smokier off the bat than the nose would suggest - Big hickory smoke character, plus the big mocha-stout character coming up behind it. As a ""rauchbier"", it fails, but it was never intended to be that, as a ""Smoked Stout"", I cannot fathom it turning out any better. A big win in my book!","Lethbridge, Alberta, CANADA","Savvy1982"

Could they improve on the weasel? Yes they can!

A super black pour with a light tan head. About three fingers of really nice puffy head, great carbonation, decent lacing...The aroma is simply outstanding with great balance and complexity. Starts off nice and smokey but balanced by bacon and just the right amount of coffee to cut into the smoke and not let it dominate like most smoked beers...The taste is just awesome as well, there is only a smoke accent that goes along with the great coffee flavor of the normal version, then the smoke comes back for a smokey finish, a totaly ""backdraft"" of smoke.

How: Tap at Hill Farmstead Winter Gathering 2011
The look: Black body topped by a medium beige head with good retention
In long: Nose is very smoky, roasted, notes of espresso and yes some bacon.  Taste is roasted, plenty of caramel, usual coffee and black chocolate, earth, a lot of smoke, some beef jerky and yes some bacon.  Body is full and carbonation is lively.  Quite easy to drink actually.  I dont think it is because the name that I imagined the bacon taste.  I often find that some heavily smoked beers develop a bacon taste, but never to the extent of this beer.  Maybe they really used smoked bacon to make this beer.  That would be gross.

This is may be the most smoky beer I have ever tasted. It smells and tastes like sitting by the camp fire. I am instantly transported to the woods sitting around a camp fire enjoying the moon light. This is what beer geek bacon is doing for me. It is also very salty like a baltic porter. giving it that real bacon character. However, It has not lost the characteristics of the amazing stout on which it is based. The chocolate and coffee come through late in the palate lingering with the the smoke and salt. This is an amazing beer and very unique. I would be lying if I said I had not consider brewing a bacon flavoured beer myself.

536,"2011-03-10",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 19, 2013 500ml bottle labeled Rauch Geek Breakfast.

It pours into my snifter a thick dark absolute black with a foamy and glistening tan head. It is pretty basic, but also pretty nice to look at.

The smell is amazing. It has a thick coffee house scent over the top of deep and roasty malt scents. There is an abundance of sweet and dark chocolate in there as well. A bit of smoke can be smelled underneath. Again, it is pretty simple, each flavor can be picked out, it is very clean and precise.

The flavor packs a punch. Tons of coffee and roasty, smoky malts. It coats the tounge with flavor. The bitterness is up there, but overall it is in check. There is a wonderful sweetness underneath it all that keeps it all together. It has an alcohol presence for sure, but i isnt overpowering.

The mouthfeel is ultra thick and creamy. Perhaps too much so for my taste, though i may be in the minority here. The drinkability is surprising. I am quaffing this like nobodys business right now.

This is a powerful brew, and a delicious one at that.

I also made a burger to go with it, i caramelized some onions with some cane sugar, sherry, butter, olive oil, salt, pepper, and some bacon bits, mixed in some smoked mozzarella, then put a spoonful on an elk burger and covered that with a slice of smoked gouda. The flavor combo was out of this world.

The smoke isnt too heavy or meaty as others are, and blends nicely with the roast and cocoa. The aroma follows with the rich bittersweet cocoa and dark roasted espresso forming the base.

Everything from the Beer Geek Breakfast is present - coffee, chocolate, with a hint that there is smoked malt in here. I was expecting big smoke in this one, but it seems good to balance as a subtlety instead of throwing it in your face.
Chocolate, vanilla, little coffee, little smoke, and hops. Again the smoke is just right. While I was hoping for actual bacon in a beer labeled ""Beer Geek Bacon"" I cant say Im disappointed I didnt find chunks of bacon floating around.
Velvety smooth, with a hint of bitterness. The smoke doesnt stick around like a real rauchbier, and that is a good thing - sometimes. Carbonation thins it out enough and brings the bitterness from the hops to the tongue after you swallow.
Very drinkable if you dont mind sleeping in a little late. The smoke is just subdued enough that you forget it is a smoked beer. But after a bit you remember that it is a decently strong beer. Good for a cold winter night with a big steak - from the grill of course. Or a smoked salmon. Mmmm. Just wish it had actual bacon. Then I could have it for breakfast with some eggs.

7 Undeniably pleasant aroma - rich smoky malts, a touch on the wooly side rather than the bacony side. Coffee clear but not prominant.
4+ Black, dark head, a little fizzy and brief. Would have been a 5 were it not for the coffee killing the head retention.
7+ Stonking rich roasty taste, gentle coffee component, nicely balanced, but a little too dark and roasty, lacking the big quaffability of the weasel.
4+ Again, very full, but a touch on the sticky side. Pleasant carbonation. Finish on the burnt side of roast. Leaves the mouth and the lips coated with stickiness, not saying ""drink me Ill quench yout thirst"". Which is a shame, as it covers the 7.5% brilliantly.
15+ A whisker short of brilliance, this is just very good. Do pour carefully, as once you let the crud (bottom 10-15%) across, youre up for a much more slimy experience.

536,"2010-12-18",3.7,"Pours a deep, deep dark brown color that appears pitch black in the glass. Completely opaque without even the slightest hint of lighter color when held to a light source and a frothy three finger mocha colored head. Excellent retention, only slowly fading into a lasting cap that coats the glass with large chunks of soapy lacing.

Very smokey malt aroma with hints of silky chocolate malt, roasted coffee/espresso bean, oatmeal and burnt toast complimenting the usual smoke/rauchbier notes. Hints of campfire, butane, ash, charcoal and BBQ bacon. The smokiness in the aroma isnt as extreme as I had hoped but its still pretty intense.

Chewy medium body with a very bitter, roasty smoked malt flavor that dominates throughout into a long dry finish. This beer is also surprisingly hop forward adding to the roasty bitterness. Silky chocolate malt and a creamy lactic presence add balance to the smokiness. Im also picking up hints of oatmeal roasted coffee bean, burnt toast and toffee. Again, as in the aroma, its not as intensely smokey as I expected but the usual burnt malt, charcoal, bacon, BBQ and charred notes are still evident.

Overall, this beer is more well balanced than I prefer for this style but the surprising hop character is quite nice.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

A little intimidated prior to the first taste by how much smoke is in the aroma, but it actually doesnt affect the taste that much. The oats become more noticeable, the coffee is a bit more subtle, and the smoke is still there (but not too strong).

Coffee, roasted malt, and dark chocolate become much more pronounced. I get a bit of sweet chocolate cake in there, but the bitterness from the dark roast is delightful-- fantastic contrast.

As an oatmeal stout though its a fantastic beer in and of itself, so dont get me wrong.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"
536,"2010-10-14",3.8,"Serving: 600 ml. bottle from State Line Liquors. 
Aroma: The nose is a nice mix of smoke, nuts, a bit of band aid, peat, and a touch of ham. 
Appearance: It pours black with slight ruby highlights and a dense, tan head. 
Taste: The flavor is a nice mix of a dry stout and a smoked beer.  There are notes of black coffee, cigarette smoke, smoked ham, peat, and earth. 
Palate: It has a medium to rich body with lower than average carbonation and a lingering burnt and smokey finish. 
Overall: An outstanding example of a smoked beer with a twist.  Recommended!","Leesburg, Virginia, USA","Elwood"
536,"2010-10-13",3.0,"UPDATED: NOV 22, 2010 On tap @ Henrik, Bergen. Pours a black body with a light, foamy caramel head. Smell is leather, burnt toast and coffee, with hints of smoke. First sip: strong, almost astringent bitter burnt toasty notes, some hops in the background. Coffee and hints of smoke comes around in the aftertaste. A relatively light body heightens drinkability, but I miss the kind of roasty meat flavor that usually goes with a rauch; Im just not feeling it here. Wheres the bacon? The smoke and ashes? The cured meat or tobacco? On a second note: the tap at Henriks is probably a tad bit too cold; the beer does pick up in flavor after a while, but not quite enough. A bit of a disappointment really, I had high hopes for this one.","Bergen, NORWAY","ClubGonzo"

The beer pours an inky black color with a large tan head. 

The aroma is quite a bit of smoke, but I also get a lot of chocolate and roasted malt. I also get a little bit of coffee in the aroma, but it is hidden behind the other components. 

The flavor is very similar and just as complex. The smoke is the dominant flavor, with the coffee and heavily roasted malts also being main components. I get a little bit of chocolate, but not hear as much as in the aroma.

Appearance: Displays a heavy-looking black body on the underside of a two inch-high layer of dark tan foam.

Smell: Luscious nose suggestive of either Kahlua or Godiva liqueurs, with round notes of chocolate, chocolate, vanilla, and licorice. Sure, the smoke is registering, but, come on, wheres the smoked lardons, wheres the smoked salmon? I was told thered be lardons!

Taste: Brings to mind one of the Godiva chocolate liqueurs, with its tones of bittersweet chocolate, vanilla, and sweetened coffee. Slight drift of smoke character throughout, though still not the flood of bacon-like meatiness Id seen mentioned or had hoped for. Hints of powdered licorice root and dark fruits. Touch of underlying bitterness. More of that liqueur character for the long, chewy finish.

Mouthfeel: Full-bodied. Medium carbonation. Very soft and velvety on the tongue, like the texture of melted chocolate ice cream.

Drinkability: Personally, Id hoped for more smoke as it warmed, but no dice. Still, a tasty treat to sit with down at the pub.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

A - Very dark oily black color with a pretty large, very thick, extraordinarily creamy, sticky, pillowy, cafe colored head. Pretty good retention with a nice thick, very creamy, tight layer of lace.

S - Smells wonderful with with a nice smoked/bacony aroma with plenty of roasted chocolate malt. A touch of coffee, caramel and peat aromas as well, with the coffee coming out more toward the finish. Mouthwatering.

T - Similar to the nose, but with a bit less bacony flavor. Some roasted, smokey chocolate malt. Some peaty flavors come out toward the middle. Good amount of smokey flavor with some bacon/smoked meat but a bit more of a smoked wood flavor. Decent amount of black coffee comes out toward the finish. Slightly bitter taste as well.

M - Medium body with a pretty good level of carbonation. Pretty smooth and oily feel. A touch on the thin side for what I was expecting.

D - Pretty easy to drink beer with a good amount of smokey flavors, chocolate, roasted malt, and coffee. A little too smoked wood flavor for me, and if it was just a bit more bacony it would be great.

Notes: Pretty good beer. Like I said, I just wished it was a bit more bacon/meaty smoke flavor than smoked wood. Also the smokiness hides a bit of the chocolate and coffee and oat flavors as well.

536,"2010-09-08",4.0,"Bottle, labeled as Rauch Beer Geek for the U.S. market (damn regulators.....Beer Geek Bacon is so much better).  The look is spot on.  Black, opaque, and ominous, the body holds up a thick and creamy head of dark cafe mocha foam.  Ever so slowly, the foam recedes, leaving a fan coral pattern of hard lacing etched onto the glass as it settles to a perfectly swirled film with a neat edge.  Simply beautiful.  Likewise, the nose really sings, giving notes of dark roast Italian espresso, black chocolate of a very high cacao content, creamy oats, and a sweet, smooth smoke contingent.  It doesnt come off as salty as some rauchbiers do.  Theres a subtle touch of anise, which lends its signature, licorice-like sharpness.  It smells sweet, but is sufficiently balanced by the bitterness of the coffee roast.  Great aroma overall.  The flavors are pretty darn nice as well.  Rich, bittersweet cacao and ultra-roasty, dark espresso are the theme, just like in the regular Beer Geek Breakfast, but the smooth smoke lends a deeper, complimentary earthiness.  Theres a bit of burnt caramel sweetness in there for balance, else it would be overly roasted.  Mocha stands out the most on the lengthy finish.  Now, the palate isnt perfect.  In fact, if theres a weakness here, this is it.  Though its initially smooth and creamy, with a light but persistent carbonation and a bit of a whipped feel, it gets a little sticky and saccharine on the back end.  In fact, cloying sugars coat the lips well after the glass is finished.  Otherwise, this is a mighty fine smoked stout.  Theres alot going on, and it is quite decadent, but I easily finished a bottle by myself, and I cant say that about many big stouts these days.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Unfortunatley the opener took a glass chip into the beer, so I may have to forgo all the leas. Well it does smell like bacon and super smooth burnt malt. Full bodied with creamy/foamy carbonation. The flavor is like really smooth oatmeal stout, but with a strongly burnt aspect and a whole lot of bacon smoke. With time a lot of darker milk chocolate comes forth. This is one heck of a thing to drink. Brilliant. Aged in single malt casks might improve it. Or not. Finishes, smooth, bacony, somewhat chocolate and definitely bitter. Brilliant (redundancy).","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

Taste is pretty much the same as the aroma, its very smoky and roasty!  Theres also a good lingering smoky finish.  Although I think the aroma is smokier than the taste, this is still a pretty tasty brew.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its creamy and coating with low carbonation.

A black beer that leaves lacings on the glass. Aroma is smoke, coffee, hops and chocolate. Likewise is the flavours smoke, coffee, chocolate, light hops and sweet roasted malts. This version of beer geek manages to create a very fine balance between its elements. The smoke is powerful enough to be a main-element in the beer, but still it is subdued enough to not take over and outrule the other elements. The sweetness brings in a very pleasent touch to a stout I remember as being very hopped and a bit dry. The hops are distinct enough to make a solid impression in the finish, but still subdued enough to give space to the smoke. Palate is easily creamy, soft, and body is thick. A nice expierience.","Nysted, DENMARK","flemmingwillum"

I take this mildness as a good thing, though, as some smoke beers I find too ""out there,"" living in novelty beer land. This Mikkeller is quite drinkable. The body is medium and the carbonation light and smooth. Finishes with lingering dry roast notes and light saltiness. A good beer for sure.

536,"2010-07-20",4.1,"Bottle. Deep black pour with a good looking but fast disappearing dark brown head. Stunning looks. Aroma has a lot of rich espresso coffee, delicious chocolate. The smoke takes on a subtle role behind those two main scents and behind the smoke is dark caramel, berry notes and bacon along with sirupy chocolate. The taste has a lot of nice coffee on top. Behind that there is smoke, bitter chocolate, refreshing hops, chocolaty and caramely sweetness, a rather high bitterness consisting of bitter espresso notes along with hops. Notes of strong cocoa nibs and sweet tobacco. Vague salty and espresso bitter finish. Lacks a bit of sweetness in when below 12 degress celsius, but the aroma and the looks compensate for that. Rather light mouthfeel, medium body. I expected a punch in the smokey balls, but the smoke was very subtle and only a bit more tracable than in the regular BGB. The two are very alike.","Copenhagen (formerly Aalborg), DENMARK","phredrik"
536,"2010-07-17",4.2,"Bottle 50cl. Pours a pitch black with a impressive massive brown head - more brown than most I have ever seen - It have almost a grey glow. The nose are first of all smokey like long hung spanish ham. Then it is topped with caramel, chocolate and malty notes then blends perfectly with wooden (?), coffee and alcohol notes. The taste is surprisingly mild with a medium mouthfeel. A strong malty and hoppy bitterness with lots of smoke and touches of alcohol. I is definetly an ""adults-only"" beer with plenty of testoteron. Really a good masculin beer.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","lassem"

536,"2010-07-08",4.1,"Fad: Kulsort øl med et flot lysebrunt skumhoved. Duft af røg og brændte malte. Ikke så kraftig som jeg havde regnet med, men stadig lækker. Smagen er yderst velafbalanceret imellem røgen og den sædvanlige Beer Geek, dog er den en tand mere rund og mild end den normale. Dette er et stort plus i min bog. Dejlig øl.","Husum, DENMARK","Defreni"

536,"2010-07-02",4.0,"Bottle. It pours a pitch black body and a two-finger, creamy tan head that lasts. Its quite burnt on the nose, with a pleasant but a bit weak smoke aroma. Coffee, dark chocolate and licorice also blends in. Its full-bodied and smooth on the palate, dry yet with a malty sweetness. The flavor has the usual suspects, coffee, chocolate and some licorice, but its the burnt, lightly smoked flavors that makes it stand out in the crowd. In the very end theres a fine hoppy bitterness too, adding some extra to the experience. A really pleasant beer, and it goes well with breakfast. 100702","Kristiansand, NORWAY","yngwie"

Flavor is sweet, medium roasted malt, chocolate, dry fruit, liquorices and warming alcohol. Complex, smooth flavor with a long and quite bitter aftertaste together with roasted malt and warming alcohol. The roast and smoke flavor is very delicate integrated with the rest of the flavors, not to dominating but definitively present. Delicious, really tasty and still surprisingly easy to drink.","Kristiansand, NORWAY","Beer5000"
