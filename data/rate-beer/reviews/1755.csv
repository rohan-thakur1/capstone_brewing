1755,"2015-11-14",2.7,"Tap at Macs Industrial in a pint glass. Think frothy off white head thats sporting an impressive cling. Malty with a minor smoke element. Sweetness coming though in toffee and caramel. Mouthfeel is thicker than anticipated with much more of a lager base. Taste is definitely representing the amber style with heavy fall characteristics. End is mild but mostly malt notes. Pretty standard Schells fare.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","commonmac"

1755,"2015-07-29",3.5,"At All Pints North. I asked the brewer what style of beer this was, and suggested Vienna. he said it had too many hops for that. I think the Amber lager is a good label nonetheless. It is well hopped, but not like a well hopped pale lager, such as Arminius. The malt has a lightly roasted quality, and is on the dry side. Great palate.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
1755,"2015-07-15",3.1,"12 oz. bottle, consumed on 7-15-15. Pours a clear bronze to light amber with a moderate amount of cream to light taupe-colored head. Good lacing. Quite nice appearance. Pleasant, simple, mineral aroma features a dry caramel scent. Dry, cracker, soda water flavor. Smooth in the palate. Not as crisp as a lager should be. Very simple beer that did not elicit many notes from me. Its pleasant enough but not at all outstanding. Im not really understanding the early high ratings.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
1755,"2015-07-15",3.7,"(bottle) Pours a clear amber color with a nice medium off-white head that stays well. Aroma is composed of gummie bears and iced tea (in that order), along with a little prune vibe, toasty malt, and some candied apple. All of these scents are meshing, and theyre meshing quite well. Flavor is not as ""meshed"" as the aroma, but its still quite fine with a more prominent iced tea character, caramel, minerals, barley(?) towards the back that takes on a bit of a breakfast cereal finish (one of those no-frills, no sugar types) at the very end. A little hop sting here as well. Overall I had low expectations for this beer, but they were more than met and Ill even say were exceeded. Good on Schell for making this more than a run-of-the-mill beer.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
1755,"2015-07-15",3.8,"12oz bottle pours a bright clear Amber with a medium khaki head. Aroma lightly fruity hops, light resin, and dry caramel malt. Taste of dry earthy caramel and toffee malt, with a light hop fruitiness, hop bitterness well balanced with the malt, and light yeast. Im impressed for the style.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
1755,"2015-07-13",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 18, 2016 I am really loving this beer. I agree with the 1st reviewer it would appeal to APA drinkers. Since APA and Vienna Lagers are two of my favorite styles and Schells is one of my favorite brewerys I was excited about this one. Taste reminds me of Mirror Pond pale ale. Clean tropical hops, nice malt balance, drinks easy and is just delicious. Will be a regular for me.","Minneapolis, ","Obfuscate"
1755,"2015-07-02",3.7,"Bottle. First one to rate the new anniversary beer from my favorite regional brewery. Pours rich amber with off-white head. Good lasting rocky head Nose is surprisingly citrusy - with orange peel and some fresh hop resin notes. Flavor is quite simple and straightforward with no appreciable flaws. Single bready barley malt upfront meets afforementioned citrus hops with just a bit of sweetness in the middle. Finish is all citrusy hops with a touch of bitterness. A very good hoppy vienna that would greatly appeal to APA drinkers - a nice crossover but also just a very nice clean darkish lager in its own right. Ill have another.","San Francisco, California, USA","asedzie"
