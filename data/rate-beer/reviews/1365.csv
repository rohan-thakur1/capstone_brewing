1365,"2017-05-02",3.8,"Pours a dark brown with a thinner beige head. The aroma is good, but is a bit subdued. Its strong in caramel and rye, with bread, nuts, earthy malt, and a little licorice. The taste is kind of sweet, and it has just a hint of tartness initially. Strong similarities to the nose, this one is well balanced with caramel, earthy malt, and rye. The aftertaste is a nutty caramel that sticks with you for a good amount of time. Its light to medium in body, with a very smooth, almost creamy texture, and is a bit softer in carbonation. Extremely easy to drink, you get to appreciate this without being bludgeoned by any extreme impressions. I need more of these in my refrigerator.","Palatine, Illinois, USA","Scipio"
1365,"2016-08-28",3.0,"12 ounce bottle from House of Bottles in Marengo, IL, served at a bit below cellar temp in a Zwyiec lager glass. Gusher, I think probably the first one Ive had from this style. This was stored for the past week in (relative) coolness & darkness, and then refrigerated for a while, so...no date on the label by the way so no help there. Anyway, after several minutes the light tan foam subsides enough over the translucent dark maple body so that I can actually drink this...nose is all caramel to start, and caramel continues to dominate, though some toasty/smoky malts show up, along with a touch of licorice...body is fairly sweet throughout, brown sugar and burnt/toasted malts, lightly acidic after the midpoint, just a touch dry towards the finish...low to moderate carbonation, texture just verging on watery/thin. Been quite a while since Ive had a dunkel, so not sure what Im judging this on, but its all right if a bit too sweet for my taste in a lighter-bodied lager.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
1365,"2016-06-30",3.8,"Pours dark mahogany with a tan head. The aroma has smooth toasty rounded lager malt, nuttiness and some richness. It has a medium smooth body with very soft gentle carbonation. The taste is super rounded and smooth with walnuts, light rye, dry caramel and some lots of lager goodness. Great beer.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
1365,"2016-01-19",3.5,"Clear dark brown pour, minimal beige head, a little lacing. Nice aromas, rye, caraway and some malt. Tastes bready, rye is quite noticeable. Nice smooth finish, very smooth and drinkable. First beer from metropolitan, wont be the last, I like it.","McHenry County, Illinois, USA","mfhennig"
1365,"2015-12-14",3.9,"Pours jet black with khaki color head. Aroma is strong caramel with rye. Flavor is coffee with a bitter hops finish. Really nice surprise.","","Cousin_Larry"
1365,"2015-06-27",3.9,"12oz bottle. Im not a fan of rye, and am generally less than enthusiastic about Dunkels. They nail it here, though. The rye complements the deep brown chocolate notes very well. Perfect body, doughy and creamy. I really enjoy seeing lagers done well. Good stuff.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
1365,"2015-06-16",3.8,"Dark brown. Nose of clean biscuuty lager malt and nutty cocoa. Flavor is mild dark fruit with powdery roast and soft, nutty roast malt/cocoa. Real clean with lingering dark fruit and cocoa.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"

1365,"2015-05-19",3.7,"Bottle. Pours a deep chestnut brown, big creamy off-white head with exceptional retention and lacking. Nose is malt forward, roasted barley, pumpernickel bread, white pepper. Mouth is full bodied, nutty, some rue spice, roast, mild sweetness, caramel and light cocoa, toasted dark breadiness. Very nice dunkel from an underrated Chicago brewery. Prost!","Bridgeport, Chicago, Illinois, USA","ryecatcher"
1365,"2015-04-25",3.5,"12oz bottle. Pours dark reddish brown with a foamy beige head. Aroma is of malt, dark fruit, rye, and spice. Almost smells like a loaf of rye bread. Taste is of dark fruit, rye and malt. Has a fair amount of spiciness. Has a huge rye taste that underlies everything. Mouthfeel is medium and sticky, but drinks very easy. If you like rye, youll enjoy this beer.","Burbank, Illinois, USA","BeerBunker"
1365,"2014-11-02",3.3,"Pour on tap, hazy reddish brown with white head, aroma brought brown sugar, slight acidic malt, hints of dark fruit, rum soaked raisins, hints of spice, yeast. Taste is a mix of dark fruity notes, some caramel, toffee, hints of spice, yeast, touch of bread, finishing sweet, slightly spicy.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
1365,"2014-09-11",3.7,"Bottle from Binnys Mix-a-Six rack. Yeasty rye bread smell right under the cap. A little puff of foam peeps out of the top of the bottle before I pour it into my dimpled St. Pauli Girl glass. Opaque brown color, head just keeps kicking up as I pour a bit at a time. Taste has, first, suggestions of smoked or Scotch malt. Chewy dark bread, treacle, this kind of flavor brings out the alcohol no matter how much or how little is there. Still some yeast in the palate, so its not filtered too much. Rye spiciness is in moderation. A filling beer that would stand up to a broiled or stewed meat dish.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
1365,"2014-07-15",3.5,"Darker tan with hints of red, with a slight tan head. Fruity, grainy nose. Hay. Slightly bitter, some roasted notes, mostly sweet. Reasonably heavy, medium carbonation. Longish finish. Very nicely balanced.

1365,"2014-07-03",3.3,"I think of Metropolitan as being pretty traditional, which is part of why I like them, but this is a little bit unusual. Not only is rye not a standard malt for a dunkel, it is also way on the strong side, making this very much an Americanized take on the style. It is a very nice chestnut brown color and completely clear w/ just a little bit of head. Its nose has a bit of raisiny malt and a hint of floral hops. The taste is a bit on the sweet side and this is medium bodied w/ fairly creamy carbonation. It definitely seems a bit heavier than a standard dunkel, which it is so that makes sense. I was not so keen on this at first but by the end of the glass, it started taking on a nice malt depth with chocolate, dried cherry and toasted grain all forming a nice cushion of flavor. I think if this were brought down to five percent alcohol or so and was a little less sweet w/ the same malt character, it would be great but as it is, it is still pretty good.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"
1365,"2014-06-26",3.3,"Cool beer. Light brown. Smelled and tasted like rye bread with a nice chocolate spread. It worked for me some how. Medium bodied.","Georgia, USA","rdixon77"

1365,"2014-06-24",3.5,"Many thanks to Eugene for the bottle - dark ruby pour - moderate lace - nose is sweet toffee/caramelized sugars, raisin, dark breads (pumpernickel, rye), light hop presence - medium body, low carbonation, fairly creamy texture - flavor is quite sweet, heavy on dark malt richness, toffee - there is some balancing bitterness and spicy and toasty rye - flavors of dark bread - medium high sweetness lingers throughout, despite some bitterness and earthy/spicy rye that tries to balance - finish is a little thin - rye lingers long on the palate - fairly solid dunkel, despite the occasionally high sweetness - the addition of rye is a mixed bag, but adds some additional complexity.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
1365,"2014-06-14",3.6,"Bottle. Chocolate fudge, light smoke, and rye malt aroma. Dark chestnut with small head. Lightly sweet chocolate and mild rye bread malt flavor. Medium body. Pleasant.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"
1365,"2014-06-13",3.5,"Purchased at Bottles and Cans in Chicago, IL; enjoyed on a Friday afternoon prior to seeing Kids in the Hall! Appearance is a dark rubyish brown with a thin lightly white head that rims around the glass. Aroma of light nuts and caramel, definitely malty, light toffee as well. Taste goes down with a very light spice, more malty than anything else, overall pretty decent dark lager.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","andyhwcinc"
1365,"2014-06-05",3.3,"Sweet, rye bread hits you first in the aroma. Combined with sweet malt/molasses. Pours a deep brown, with a wall of a tan head that fades nicely. Nice rich sweet malt out the gate. Caramel and roasted malt comes though also. Rye comes in on the back end, with a bitterness that intensifies...but is not overbearing. Medium, slick body. Not bad.","Round Lake, Illinois, USA","sawbuck"
1365,"2014-05-27",3.8,"[Tap] Very dark brown pour with a large light brown head on top. Dry cocoa powder, caramel and toasted grains in the aroma. Spicy rye malt, molasses, toasted bread, light anise, toffee and faint earthy hoppiness in the taste. Full bodied and creamy for the style. Lingering toffee sweetness in the finish. A solid beer.","Illinois, USA","troyc"

1365,"2012-06-14",3.8,"Draft at Jerrys. Clear, dark amber with good, creamy, tan head / Sweet nose of dark fruit and cola / Medium body, lively carbonation, sweet and malty, somewhat syrupy, with modest hop balance and finish / Sweet, toasty flavors of chocolate, prune, plum, and caramel / This style is not for me, but I peg it to be a good representation of the style.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jstraw"
1365,"2012-06-14",3.5,"Draft at the Rev Party. Pours a deep, near black with a huge head. Nose is moderately grainy and spicy, hints of bread crust and Munich malt. Faint hop notes, but mostly just malt forward. Clean overall. On tasting, the rye adds a bit of grainy earthiness on top of the strong Munich malt character. Body is medium. Balanced overall. Decent beer.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
1365,"2012-06-07",3.8,"On tap at Brixies in Brookfield, IL., and dispensed to a shaker with a darkest brown, ruby highlighted color, a fingers width of moussy, off white/light tan head foam, and wavey cling to the lacing. The aroma was mellow grain, toastiness, almost roastiness, rich malt, and a hint of vanilla. A medium+ body, some creaminess to the mouthfeel, and moderate carbonation were appropriate to successfully project the decent melanoidin character, light hints of caramel, toffee, and molasses, the sense of some dark fruit sweetness, and a light, finishing dryness. I was happy to finally catch up with this brew after missing out at a few other establishments. Not at all disappointed, and well worth the search.","Lombard, Illinois, USA","tmoreau"
1365,"2012-05-18",3.7,"Draft on tap at Beer Under Glass 2012 (Chicago, IL). Pours a rich brownish pour, gentle faint haze and a glowing copper edges with glow. A big cakey beige head atop with solid lacing, sticks around well. Aromas are toasty and darker, faint cocoa, good biscuits, toast, and mellow toffee. Gentle mellow dryness, toast, and darker sweetness. Initial is lighter end of medium bodied offering firm toasty qualities, brown malts, earth, gentle cocoa. Some touches of molasses, toffee, and toast. Flavorful upfront, trailing into a mellow sweet middle still with some gentle caramel, toffee. A touch of stickiness on the palate, with mellow rye malts, some gentle spice and dryness. Really well balanced and integrated.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
