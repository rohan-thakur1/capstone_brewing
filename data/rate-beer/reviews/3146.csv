3146,"2015-11-20",4.0,"375 mL bottle, Originally reviewed 5/18/2015.

Deep purple. Lightly pink head. Very pretty beer.

Strong berry aroma. Wine barrel, too. Strong vinous notes.

Intense blackberry flavor. Equally strong is the red wine flavor with it. Quite sour, but not as sour as other Side Project sours, which I like.

Medium body. Medium carbonation. Hefty sourness.

Excellent fruit flavor, but the wine flavor is in equal proportion. Just about a tolerable amount of sourness.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

3146,"2015-05-25",3.3,"Tasting at MattsDark purple color with small pink head. Strong sour aroma, with deep fruity connotation, a bit sweaty, light acetone, a bit of fruit kernels. The acidity is so much that makes pure lemon juice easy to drink; there is some berry juice. Astringent final too, along with the acidity.Frankly excessive, ungraceful, Im not even sure this is nice to drink, but I got a small glass anyway.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
3146,"2015-05-24",4.0,"Dark red pour with a white head. The aroma is full of funky blackberries with some oak and woody character. The flavor is more of the same.

3146,"2015-05-20",3.7,"Bottle - Blackberry and light lacto funk. Deep purple with a light pink head. Acidic, blackberry, and crazy tartness. Fruit shines, but overwhelming tartness takes away from what could be great.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
3146,"2015-05-20",3.7,"375mL bottle, pours a dark red / maroon / brown with a small pinkish beige head. Aroma brings out dry wild pithy blackberries, with a touch of leather and oak. Flavour is complex, with notes of lactic acid and pithy blackberries upfront. Low-to-medium tartness with a little oak in there further on. The lactic quality is quite prominent. Overrated in my opinion. Its very nice for what it is, but not terribly complex or anything.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

3146,"2015-04-14",4.5,"Bottle sent to me during Free Beer Week by Keir. Thanks a million! Where to begin with this one? How about: ""Holy shit!"" This beer has it all going on for it. Really nice jammy blackberry notes all over the nose. Hints of oak waft out alongside a nice funky sour note. Taste is a journey from blackberry jam sweetness to blue cheese funk to wet oak to more dark fruits notes that provide a nice sour punch to it. Waves of flavors keep pouring out of this. The funky note is the peak in this beer and it is bookended by a sweet and sour harmony. Killer stuff, just killer.","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"

3146,"2015-02-20",4.3,"7000th rating. 375 ml bottle from Keir- thanks again, Keir! Pours a hazy berry juice-looking shade of violet with a small off-white head that has a little tint to it. Theres a lot of symmetry to the aroma and flavor here; notes of blackberry, yogurt, oak, rose petals, sugars, lactic acid, vanilla, dark cherry, and a squirt of lemon juice and red wine vinegar. Light-medium bodied, with moderate carbonation and a dry, tart, fruity, and barely biting mouthfeel. Excellent beer that lived up to the early buzz that has shaped its reputation.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

3146,"2015-02-17",4.1,"Tasted on 2/6/15 from a capped 375mL bottle, big thanks to Emily for sharing. Pours opaque dark beet red with a thick pink head that leaves thin, spotty lace. The nose is jammy brambly berry with some nice red wine vinegar, a light herbal note, and animal funk. The flavor is all about the bramble jam a hint more vanilla oak, very sour but balanced. The body is nearly full with lively carbonation, heavy tannin, and a long sour bramble finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
3146,"2015-02-16",4.4,"375ml bottle, thanks to phaleslu for sharing. Beautiful dark red color. Touch of blue/purple in there. Thin ring of off-white pinkish head. Love the seductive color. Fantastic blackberry and mild dark chocolate aroma in the nose, really love it. Mild oak and some grapefruit, touch of cream cheese. Wonderful bigger sour taste, really big... Close to the level of sourness in the Fencerow, which I loved. Light sweet taste. Big long tart aftertaste. Love it. Medium to bigger body. Kind of slick texture. Lighter carbonation. Fantastic, fantastic stuff. Im usually very reluctant to give that 18/20 away, but I have to give it here. Seems like a good bigger sweet aspect to the sourness, not as dry, provides a nice balance vs the Fencerow.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
3146,"2015-02-15",4.5,"Bottle courtesy of Joe, just like every other good beer I rate here. Poured to a Cantillon taster. Pours dark purple and slightly murkey with a beautiful bubbly pinkish purple head on top that fizzes away after a minute or two. Super funky aroma, with vinegar and barnyard, serious dry oakiness, and a bit of jammy berry. Flavor is very fruit forward with lots of jammy raspberries, but then the puckering sour hits your tongue and follows all the way down the throat. Acidic and lambic like, dry oak flavors, lacto like crazy, and finishes puckering and dry. Somehow the fruit still shines here, though. Dry, medium light bodied, with spritzy carbonation. This is good stuff for sure.","Florida, USA","BMMillsy"
3146,"2015-02-12",4.3,"Pours a deep dark red. Aroma of berries, lacto and funk. Taste is sour berries, so fruity, so sour. Phenomenal sour, great fruit presence","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","jcartamdg"

It has a medium / thin super crisp biting body with a bit of sharp carbonation. The flavor starts with lots of tart blackberry, lactic acid, lemon, red wine, sharp bugs and light vinegar.
