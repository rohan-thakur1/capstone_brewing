3992,"2017-06-04",4.0,"Aroma:

Medium aroma of malts, caramel, dark fruit, liquorice, tropical fruit, chocolate, roasted malts, hops and citrus.

Appearance:

Opaque dark brown/black beer with a slight/medium beige/brown head.

Taste/Palate:

Starts medium/heavy sweet with malts, caramel, dark fruit, liquorice, tropical fruit and chocolate; ends slightly bitter and dry with roasted malts, hops and citrus.

Overall:

This beer is intense, complex and balanced. Loads of tropical fruit and liquorice, with everything a black IPA needs. Perfect appearance and a great palate as well, but the aroma could have been stronger.","NETHERLANDS","MelvinKalksma"

Light black with a decent tan cap.

Taste comprises light charr, subtle roast, toffee, cocoa sprinkle, pine dusting.
Medium bodied, fine carbonation, semi drying close peppered with earthy hop bitterness.
Decent enough CDA but far from TOP 50 material for me.","Hazlemere, the lower Xhitlerns, Buckinghamshire, ENGLAND","Theydon_Bois"
3992,"2017-04-27",3.8,"Bottle. Pretty much black with a large light tan head. Spiced chocolate brioche aroma with floaty grapefruit and orange blossoms, some nectarine. Soft texture, medium bodied. Like a number other BIPAs I like, carbonation is on the low side of medium - it seems to bring out the chocolate whilst still giving the citrusy hops room to move. The chocolate, bread and caramel malty flavours are nice but maybe a bit simpler than suggested in the aroma - the rye doesnt get up to much really. Fairly bitter at a finish that dries out only a little. Floral and citrus notes linger.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","hawthorne00"
3992,"2017-04-22",4.3,"Como debería ser una black IPA con centeno, y punto! No estará de acuerdo el bjcp pero la presencia de notas tostadas y torrefactas, con un cuerpo sedoso y viscoso es lo que busco en el estilo. Sumado al centeno, su característica burbuja y su punto especiado, el cítrico del amarillo y nueva dosis especiada y resinosa del simcoe, el resultado es un paso te. Ahora ponlo en una botella guapa y de 50 CL y puedes ir a dormir tranquilo!","oviedo, SPAIN","eljebi"

3992,"2017-02-08",3.3,"500ml bottle at home bought at Beer Republic. No obvious BB date. almost black color, rather big coffee-colored head. smells earthy, grassy, licorice, light chocolate, bit soapy, some pines, rather lovely smell. full body, light carbonation, soft mouthfeel. tastes ash, bitter herbal, bit citric, bit old hoppy, dusty, some charcoal. finishes lightly bitter with notes of licorice, old hops and some charcoal. hmm, smell was quite nice, but taste has some problems, first, too light carbonation, which makes the beer unpleasant and boring to drink, then too much on the bitter charcoal / ashy side lacks some balance. Might be an issue with freshness, but since there is no BB date ... how should I know..","Vienna, AUSTRIA","Werckmeister"

3992,"2016-10-27",4.5,"Pours very dark brown with reddish hues. Great thick tan coloured creamy head which dissipates a little but remains throughout and leaves thick lacing on the glass. Aromas of roasted malt, vanilla, coffee and slight floral wafts as well. Thick luscious mouthfeel, initial sweet spice, black plumbs and bitter dark chocolate on the tongue. Hop resin then kicks in before the roasted malt takes its turn to take over proceedings. Very interesting complexity, finishes with a nice bitterness that I suspect is more from the malt rather than hops.

3992,"2015-12-18",4.3,"Bottle from Wine Emporium 181215. This is the type of beer that you can really get your teeth into. I can see where the midnight part fits into the name, with a reference on the label to Dexeys Midnight Runners but also the thick black colour of this beer is reminiscent of the witching hour on a moonless dark night. In the mouth this beer is smooth as silk with a combination of chocolate and malt aromas and flavours and fills the mouth with a creaminess that leads to a long finish. As always with Tuatara Brewing this beer comes in a bottle with the scaley ""skin"" of the tuatara, the reptile native to New Zealand that this brewery is named after.","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","mkel07"

3992,"2015-08-14",4.1,"This isnt so much a beer as a staple food. A kind of ploughmans lunch. But, lets face it, if ploughmen had this kind of lunch, wed all be ploughmen. Theres plenty of hoppiness in this ale, but the hops are not the star of the show, they are there to prise open the cracks and windows in what might otherwise be a solid, impenetrable wall of malt. The hops are there to let the (flavoured) air in. They open it up: I taste the hops, but then I am immediately dragged into to the delicious roasty/burnt/cured meat gritty malt that carries the hops. Delicious, warming, low-med bitterness, spicy black pepper at the end. Vitamin B for Africa. Cannot taste the 7.5% ABV. I really want another one.","North Shore, Auckland, NEW ZEALAND","DylansDad"
