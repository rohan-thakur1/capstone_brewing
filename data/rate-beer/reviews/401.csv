401,"2014-07-09",3.7,"In short: A caramelized and piney-resinous Cream Ale for the bitter IPA lover.
How: Tap at Vices. & Versa, Montreal. 
The look: Clear golden-orange body topped by a persistent medium creamy off-white head.
In long: The hop forward nose is mostly pine-tree, somewhat resinous, a tiny bit citrusy. In mouth the body is full with a typical cream ale foamy/creamy texture. Taste has nice crisp caramel, toasted crusty bread, a lot of pine tree, sticky hop resin. Nitro is not kind to hoppy beers and many Cream Ales end-up lacking bitterness, but it is not the case here, this is a very bitter beer. A good pint of beer I had directly at the brewery, and just so you know, Ive never been asked twice by the same person please watch my beer while I go to the bathroom.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Une large dentelle décore la paroi du verre.  Au nez, une salade fruitée sur des fleurs fraîches et des choses sucrées.  Sur les papilles, des houblons qui donnent des fruits et qui proposent une amertume contrôlée.  Des céréales qui caressent la langue.  En bouche, lhabituel travail de lazote.  En finale, des notes amères assez longues qui sont remplies par des fleurs et par des aiguilles de pin.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
401,"2012-09-11",3.2,"On tap at Vice et Versa, pours a hazy orangey amber with a small creamy beige head. Aroma of citrus and orange rinds, tropical fruity hops, some fungal qualities, and what seems to be a thick caramel malt backbone  seems more of an IPA (English style) than cream ale on the nose. Flavour definitely shows the hybrid style more so, with lots of creamsicle upfront, followed by some tropical fruity hops, ending with a significant pleasant astringency from the hops. Creamy, soft palate. Very well-constructed and highly drinkable.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
401,"2012-08-07",3.5,"My Bottom Line :  
Citrusy and floral hops thrive in this nitrogenated IPA, before light caramel malt are able to pierce the puffy mouthfeel created by the gas.

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A creamy head of foam covers the russet haze.
-The aroma could have been more engaging. Put their APAs nose on this one and youve got a winner.
-There is a subtle emptiness in the flavor profile before the resinous hop bitterness appears.
-The nitrogen content of this brew might be too high to let the malts and hops express themselves efficiently.
