305,"2017-05-15",4.8,"Bottle shared by John, thank you! Pour is one shade lighter than stout with almost no head - a thin ring of sporadic bubbles. Aroma is brown sugar, toffee, and vanilla with a light buttery nutty aroma. Huge and rich Favor is true with loads of sweet toffee malt and rich vanilla bourbon. Like liquid brown sugar aged in vanilla bourbon More please.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","beernbourbon"
305,"2017-04-26",3.9,"Blend 2. Super dark pour with light carbonation. Nose is heavily malty with raisin liqueur, a touch of smoke. Mouth is super malt-forward again with strong dark fruits (dates), lots of bourbon barrel, a bit of smoke. Rough and brash but good stuff.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","JAXSON"
305,"2017-04-12",4.5,"750 ml bottle shared by John - thanks a ton, John! Blend #2. Finally slaying this personal whale. Pours a cloudy browned amber with a small beige head that quickly settles into a ring. Oh man, this is so decadent. Massive barrel character here. Layers upon layers of sweet caramel, toffee, brown sugar, bourbon, oak, dried fruits, nuts, and vanilla. The oak has some char to it and the bourbon brings some warmth. Medium-plus bodied, with modest carbonation and a sweet, warming mouthfeel that soaks into the palate. Really digs in, but in a good way. This is a beast, but its absolutely delicious and immensely satisfying.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
305,"2017-03-21",4.1,"750 ml bottle to goblet (Blend #2). Been chasing this whale for awhile now, and am happy to have harpooned it. Looks solid; a murky brown with no visible carbonation. Smells great! Loads of chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and oak. Tastes like it smells, but less decadent, with a warming and pleasantly boozy full-bodied mouthfeel. A delicious sipper, but glad I didnt become a eunuch to get the tick.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"

305,"2017-01-08",4.2,"Bottle... This beer rocks! Pours cloudy and dark brown with a small, short-lived head. The aroma is a lush swirl of toastiness and roastiness with layers of caramel, maple syrup and demerara sugar. There are also big-time notes of dark rum and bourbon. Full-bodied with a thick mouthfeel and laid-back carbonation. The flavor is hearty and boozy, boasting raisins, brown sugar, caramel, dried plum and oceans of liquor in the warming, intoxicating finish. Many thanks to landhoney for providing this world-class beer!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

It has a full smooth rich body with some mild carbonation. The flavor starts with dark caramel, oak, bourbon, vanilla, dates figs, light sice and full rick malt. The finish has oak, spices, vanilla and huge richness. Like dessert in a glass.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

305,"2015-09-22",4.7,"Bottle. Dark brown pour with a fleeting off white head. Sweet caramel aromas. Big sweet caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, and chocolate highlights. Oak and booze copilots. Fantastic. Complex with a massive body. Truly this is an incredible beer.","Florida, USA","50belair"
305,"2015-09-21",4.3,"750 mL bottle poured into a snifter. Murky deep brown body with a small khaki head. Absurdly boozy aroma. Brown sugar, raisins, bourbon. Nutty and oaky. Taste is also extremely boozy. Bourbon and oak dominate. Nutty and caramel malts. Bitter. I expect a lot more sweetness. Its sweet, but not absurdly sweet. Heavy body. Medium carbonation. It gets pretty sweet as I drink it, but still really good. Well done.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
