1924,"2015-01-25",3.0,"(Draught at Chez Moeder Lambic Fontainas, Brussels, 25 Oct 2014) Golden colour with foamy, white head. Malty, slightly fruity nose with bread, grass, floral hops, citrus and grain. Malty taste with notes of bread, grass, floral hops, grainy malt and a balanced citric/floral bitterness. Light to medium body, quite dry. A bit unbalanced, the light malt structure doesnt really support the hops. Still, refreshing and quite enjoyable.","Hässelby, SWEDEN","Svesse"

1924,"2014-10-26",3.6,"Draft @ ML Fontainas.
Léger orangé, col blanc cassé peu tenace et laissant qcq bulles éparses.
Arôme au bouquet assez différent rappelant une sorte de grains fermentés, paille humide accompagnés de notes pains et un léger rétro-nasal fruité ici aussi assez anglais noble. 
Palais met demblée laccent sur un houblonné anglais proche du Fuggle et EKG sur des pointes maltées apportant également une bonne balance de Marris et un léger biscuité. Le tout garde des notes de moût qui me font penser au meert. Joserai maventurer à dire que cette version est plus agréable que de nombreuses bitter venant doutre-Manche.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
1924,"2014-10-25",3.3,"On tap @ Moeder Lambic Fontainas. Slightly hazy golden/amber with a medium bubbly white head and little lacing. Aroma is of light caramel, mineral notes and light herbal presence. Taste is very similar with a light earthy bitterness. Medium body. Moderate carbonation. Earthy finish. Its what you can expect from an average English Pale Ale. Not bad, but boring.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

1924,"2014-10-19",3.8,"25 cl. draft @ Chez Moeder Lambic Fontainas. Dark amber, big soapy, vanishing sparse bubbles head. Nose is soapy orange, light bitter metal. Soapy bitter orange, biscuit taste, very UK, oily, light grass finish, bergamot oil, orange peel. Low carbonation, almost cask body.
