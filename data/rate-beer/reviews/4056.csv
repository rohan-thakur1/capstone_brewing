Pours a bright golden color with a small but well retained white head & some lacing on the glass. 

I really dig the aroma on this one very aromatic, very hoppy, the hop character tends towards lots of mango & passionfruit... not a heck of a lot going on there outside the fruit forward hops... not a lot else needed though. 

The flavor is nice moderately bitter with a sort of layered hop thing going on the fruity aromatics from the aroma are certainly repeated in the taste, but to a less pungent degree add a bit of citrus rind & pineapple in there as well. However there is a bit of a woody earthiness to the hops as well... it has that sort of leafy character to it that you would expect from a English hop varietal. The malt is defiantly not buried here either and has a light toasty thing going on. The beer is basically dry but has a touch of malt sweetness up front.","Pouring Bus, Iowa, USA","CanIHave4Beers"

4056,"2014-02-14",3.7,"From notes. Bottle share courtesy of Bytemesis. Thank you! Complex.. Aromas of mango, pine and wood, with floral highlights and honeysuckle. Good up-front pop of aroma.. Unfortunately, mid-palate is a bit hollow.. Yet finish comes back to life with more tropical flavors, mango and resinous herbs. Enjoyable aroma. Happy to add my two cents about this unknown hop.

4056,"2014-02-13",4.0,"Bottle - Pours clear amber with a foamy off-white head. Nose is mango, papaya, and onion. Pungent on top of a mellow crackery malt base. Taste is mango and onion hops, a touch of citrus and pine in the background, and the same light malt base. Thick and fluffy--tastes a lot like pseudoSue.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"

[ Bottle ][ RBWG Afterparty Day 1 ][ 22oz ][ RBWG Globe ][ Free ][ 2/6/14 ]
>> Thank you NeilsenRatings for the wale. Full haze orange pour. Dank bizarre hop nose: bright Habanero, fresh yellow bell pepper, fresh garden, cilantro, mild apple. Taste is green bell pepper, cilantro, bright vegetables. Normally these descriptors would sound disgusting, but this beer is pulling it off. Whatever hops these are, they are totally whack .","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

4056,"2014-02-10",3.7,"Bomber thanks to Schlais. Pours clear light orange with a small head that fades quickly to a ring. Aroma is like dank Nelson hops with some onion. Tropical fruit, melon, grapes, onion, citrus. Taste has a light sweet and bitter balance. Fresh dank tropical hops mostly with some onion, white wine, kiwi, and spice. Fizzy and oily mouthfeel. Pretty good but the onion taste is a little strong here. And IÂ’m very surprised this is listed as an APA. Should definitely be an IPA.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"

4056,"2014-02-09",4.0,"Pours a nice golden color, 2 finger white fluffy head and sparkles int he glass. Aroma is of tropical fruits, pineapple, melon and some nice piney/earthy notes too. Taste is nice and balanced. Best of the XHops I have had yet. I like the floral/fruitiness of the hops, but this one has a nice bitter, soapy bite in the tail end. Rounds things out very nicely. The mouthfeel is very nicely balanced too. Not overly sticky or resinous, but definitely a juicy beer.","Buchanan, Michigan, USA","Clownoisseur"
4056,"2014-02-06",3.4,"22 oz bottle shared by NielsenRatings I think. Pours a slightly hazy dark golden color with a small white head.

4056,"2014-02-06",3.8,"Bottle with thanks to Pepsi! Pours crystal clear orange with a small off-white head and some lacing. Aroma is pine and spruce forward, like walking through an evergreen forest, complete with dank wet leaves. Flavor is lightly sweet and light bitter, dank, but not harsh.

4056,"2014-02-02",3.9,"22 oz bottle acquired in trade from my boy storminspank. Thanks, dude. First of the current set cracked. Pours a fairly well hazed golden orange hue, dulled darker middle, natural applesauce haziness with some orange and amber glow, dulled overall. A looser frothy whitish head atop stays as a filmy layer, sticks around with a thicker ring lacing atop. Aromas are citrusy, a bit earthy and touches of melon, white grape. Touch of gumball, tropical fruit. Bready, some florals and touch of soap. Melllow resiny hops, nice middling fruit quality, not vibrant but fairly complex. Initial is lighter end of the fold in body, gumball and tropical fruit hop flavors, some grapefruit, lemon, and melon touches. Florals, decent tom. Medium bitterness meets soap, bread and some earthiness. As we get further in, a firmer bitterness, distinct tropical fruit elements hit the palate. More fruity than mose of Toppling GoliathÂ’s hop offerings. Firm bitterness, dry florals, soap, and some Amarillo like qualities hanging on. Backend is touches of Galaxy, soap and fruit, touches of kiwi and tropical fruit. Fairly complex, good fruit flavor as we settle in. The bitterness and more floral/earth/leafy elements come and go in waves. Pretty solid stuff overall. ItÂ’s not overstated or vibrant, the nose is understated a touch until it settles then really comes around. The beer pours a bit hazy and dulled. But the beer really comes together well once you drink it. Fruity and fairly complex, that mellow malt body that doesnÂ’t intefere that TG has mastered so well. Tasty stuff. LetÂ’s see what the other ones offer.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
4056,"2014-02-02",3.8,"Bottle. Pours hazy gold with a medium, frothy white head, long retention with good lacing. Aroma is dank, earthy, and herbal hops, biscuit and honey malt with apricot esters.

4056,"2014-01-26",4.3,"Bomber thanks to joshmcg000. Hazy gold to orange pour with a 2 finger, creamy off white head that fades somewhat quickly to a skim. Aroma is loaded with tropical fruit, melon, some spicy stone fruit, a little citrus zest, biscuit and light fruity and spicy yeast notes. Flavor is again loaded with tropical fruit and melon, spicy, bitter stone fruit, light dry prairie grass and lots more floral notes than the aroma lets on. Aside from the hops thereÂ’s are some light biscuit, bready and mineral notes. Light to medium body with a slightly creamy entry, off dry finish and moderate, blanketing carbonation. Really, really fantastic.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"
4056,"2014-01-26",4.4,"Pours hazy gold Aroma is melon and tropical fruit. Taste is much the same as aroma.

4056,"2013-12-25",4.2,"22oz bomber. Unfiltered orange-tan body. Foamy, steady white head. Medium bodied, but with a massive solid hop bill. Dryish amarillo-ish strawy tones at first. Some orange, mellow tangerine, a hint of melon in the aroma. The tropical tones comes out the more you sip at it. Some pungent mango, guava, pink grapefruit start to show up. Pretty much all a beer enthusiast could ask for in a Pale Ale in late 2013. Clean malt backbone and a hefty new school hop barrage. Great stuff.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
4056,"2013-12-23",3.5,"Fine American Pale Ale, verging on IPA-like proportions. The nose is pine and grapefruit, but it also has a substantial orange-citrus note, and the orange grows stronger in the flavor, becoming marmelade. Average backbone, and a milder finish than expected. Decent. Bottle.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","Nuffield"
4056,"2013-12-22",4.3,"Aroma: huge charge of dank hops, lots of citrus and tropical fruit, very floral. Seems to have a good mix of Nelson and Galaxy character, melon, grapefruit, orange, some grapes. Light notes of malt and crackers.
Appearance: pours a fairly hazy light golden color, white head with decent retention, leaves spotty lacing.
Taste: great hop flavors - lots of ripe citrus and melon, some white grapes. Medium bitterness - nice amount for the style but not so much that itÂ’s distracting. Ripe oranges and tangerines, just tons of fruit character. Just a touch of sweetness in the finish, light malt flavors, nice balance.
Palate: light-medium body, medium carbonation, semi-dry finish.
Overall: really great APA, explodes with fruit character and fresh hops, hopefully this hop sticks around...","Iowa, USA","ekoerper"
