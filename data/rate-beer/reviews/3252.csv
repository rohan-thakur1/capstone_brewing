3252,"2017-04-13",3.8,"Refrigerated 75 cl brown bottle poured into a glass. Slightly hazy golden with small white head. Aroma is light bourbon, medium body, low carbonation, and little lacing. Taste is bourbon, candy, and fruit.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"
3252,"2016-01-22",4.3,"750 ml bottle into chalice, 2015 vintage bottling. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy orange/amber color with a 1 finger dense off white head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of big lemon, apricot, peach, pear, apple, white grape, orange peel, pepper, clove, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, and yeast/oak earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of fruity/spicy yeast, bourbon barrel, and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge lemon, apricot, peach, pear, apple, white grape, orange peel, pepper, clove, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, honey, candi sugar, bread, herbal, and yeast/oak earthiness. Good amount of bourbon/oak/yeast spiciness on the finish; with lingering notes of lemon, apricot, peach, pear, apple, white grape, orange peel, pepper, clove, vanilla, bourbon, toasted oak, honey, candi sugar, and yeast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, bourbon barrel, and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt and yeast/oak spiciness balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Moderate dryness from yeast/oak spiciness as well. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth and lightly slick/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is great. Alcohol is fairly well hidden with a light-moderate warmth lingering after the finish with zero booziness. Overall this is an incredible barrel aged tripel style. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/spicy yeast, bourbon barrel, and moderate pale malt flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. A highly enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

3252,"2014-05-27",4.3,"Sampled on draft at Hou Thou this beer poured a hazy caramel-amber color with a small foamy white head that left good lacing. The aroma was sweet honey, bourbon, coconut, bread and tropical fruits. The flavor was sweet with strong honey, candy sugar, bourbon, a noted boozy presence, tropical fruits and dried apricots. Tasted like a mix of rum cake and pineapple upsidedown cake. Long finish. Full bodied. Marvelous.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"
3252,"2014-05-05",2.2,"On tap at Heinens. Muddy dark orange amber with thin white ring. Woody herbal vanilla wafer gluey aroma. Very sweet raw spicy honey vanilla old boxed oranges with bitter herbal spicy overripe orangy finish. Thick and sticky slick. Definitely not what a tripel is meant to be. A gluey sticky mess.","Springfield, Vermont, USA","malrubius"
3252,"2013-12-10",3.9,"Aroma of vanilla, alcohol, and bourbon. Slightly hazy straw pour. Medium body, with a big mouthfeel. Definitely a sipper. Very nice.","Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, USA","icehawk"
3252,"2013-11-22",3.6,"Rating 999 had to make it special. Pours a hazy orange yellow. Aroma of orange and caramel. Taste is smooth and sweet up front with notes if vanilla followed by a tart bitterness that dries the taste and masks the ABV. In fact I only felt the strength after it hit my stomach.

3252,"2013-09-19",4.0,"Snifter at Jackie Os Public House on 9/12/13. Clear amber pour with a thick off-white head. Aroma of big bourbon, apple, banana and spice. Bourbon and vanilla oak flavor with some apple before a sweet banana finish. The barrel definitely calmed the banana some, and thats a good thing.","Capital City, Ohio, USA","JaBier"
3252,"2013-08-23",3.9,"Sample at Daily Growler. Pours a murky yellow-orange color with a thin white head that disappears quickly to a spotty outer ring. Small patches of lacing on the glass. Aroma of yeast, oak and fruit. Medium-bodied with flavors of ripe fruit, oaky vanilla and herbal yeast. Any bourbon is minimal. The finish is woody with a ripe fruit and yeast aftertaste. Pretty good overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
3252,"2013-08-20",4.1,"Draft at Eulogy. Very hazy amber with a frothy off-white head. Thick earthy honey sweet body with some vanilla bourbon notes lying subtly within. High ABV is well hidden. Very nicely balanced. No factor is overwhelming. Well done.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","NikkTwist"

3252,"2013-06-14",4.4,"On tap at Capones. Poured a golden color with a small sized off white head. Fruity, bourbon, vanilla, wood, oak, candi sugar, and some lighter spiciness. Sweeter but not cloying. Alcohol content well hidden. My favorite of the 7 Thirsty Dob beers I had that night - ordered a second one as my night cap and it sure did make me feel no more pain.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
3252,"2013-04-20",4.7,"Not my go to style but jumped at the chance since I love barrel aged beers. Absolutely delicious with that barrel flavor I was looking for and way beyond with a tense spice flavor. Had on tap at North High Brewing columbus.","Ohio, USA","greebr2003"
3252,"2013-04-05",4.0,"Draft. Now this is a tripel. Cloudy orange. Little head. Wow this is awesome. Nice smooth bourbon that covers up the things I usually dislike about Belgium yeast.

3252,"2013-04-03",3.6,"At Beer Study.  Very murky cloudy amber pour with creamy off white head.  Nose is very rich with wood and bourbon. Very heavy nose, singular.  Super bourbony flavor, vanilla, and wood.  Some fruity notes show.  Full and creamy palate. Warming finish.  A nice beer but really just a conduit for bourbon.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
3252,"2013-02-16",2.9,"This ale looked and smelled like a trippel, but its flavor was harsh and what few decent notes it possessed passed quickly.","Washington, USA","vectorborne5"
3252,"2013-02-08",3.3,"Tulip on tap at the Moerlein Lager House.. For $12, wow.. Clear orange color. Minimal white head. Little lace. Whiskey barrel evident in the nose, not much else otherwise. Bigger body. Soft lighter carbonation. Dry texture. Lemon zest in the taste, some vanilla. Light alcohol bite and little warmth in the finish. Long vanilla bourbon lightly oaky aftertaste is nice to savor. Nice to sip and try but not worth the cost. Does gets better as it sits, though","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
3252,"2013-02-03",2.8,"28th December 2011Hazy amber beer, tidy off white head. Light dry palate. Dry from the alcohol it feels like. Sweet malts with some vanilla oak but alcohol - whilst not too hot - really gets in the way. Dry finish. Okay in small doses.",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"

3252,"2012-04-30",4.4,"Growler fill. Yeah you knew this beer had to be good when both my wife and mother in law were screaming about it. I love tripels. Its sooooo sad to see them done almost universally as an afterthought or poorly. Yes there are some pretty good standards out there. But as a whole, the craft beer scene here in the USA doesnt make the style as well as say an IPA or Imp Stout. I digress. This beer was oozing so much complexity. Its hard to know where to start. Great aroma first and foremost. Lots of wood, tart fruit, spices, and whiskey. You could easily just sit and smell this beer all night. The palate was pretty hefty but not unwieldy.  Flavors rocked all over the map with fruit and bourbon leading the charge. The remarkable part was how little alcohol I actually tasted. The balance of the banana and apricot went perfectly with the wood and whiskey which happened to be broken up with citrus zest and coriander. It really just went on and on. Delectable beer. Even had enough carbonation day 2 to be quite an exciting drink the 2nd time around. High marks. Well done.","Brentwood, Tennessee, USA","MmmcKay"
3252,"2012-03-22",4.5,"Growler This beer rocks! Pours murky caramel with a small, fizzy, white head. The plush bouquet is a medley of fuzzy fruits, caramel, coconut and vanilla with a lovely splash of bourbon. Full-bodied with an oily mouthfeel and modest carbonation. The flavor is an interlaced bundle of caramel, toffee, bourbon, coconut and fallen fuzzy fruits. Finishes fruity, malty and warming. Jackie-Os Kentucky Monk really comes to mind here.  Apparently, I despise tripels, but love bourbon barrel-aged American attempts at the style.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
3252,"2012-03-13",4.5,"Bottle from Halftimebeverage.com  Delicious aromas erupt from the pour hinting of exotic flavors and subtle spices.  Barrel aging smooths the flavor over the tongue and into the belly without any harshness or bite.  You can savor the precipitates at the bottom of the glass as a sweet reward for selecting one of the best domestic Belgian Trippels youll find this side of the ocean.","Pennsylvania, USA","MarkSachon"
3252,"2011-12-09",4.4,"On tap at Thirsty Dog.  This beer is awesome.  Pours clear semi dark golden hue with thin off white head.  Aroma is bourbon, banana, clove, a touch of caramel and honey with some vanilla.  Medium mouthfeel.  The flavors meld together perfectly in this beer.  The beer components are cut through and balanced perfectly by the barrel aging here.  While the base beer is pretty rough around the edges and I find difficult to drink the barrel makes this a beautiful beer.  Bourbon, mostly bananas and caramel make this a real treat.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","fiver29"
3252,"2011-11-29",4.5,"Growler from the brewery 11-11  Cloudy, golden-brown color with a medium beige head.  Smelled delicious with a sweet, caramelly and Bananas Foster nose and hinting of vanilla, chocolate, cherry and coconut.  A sweet, bourbon, oaked, coconut milk and vanilla bean flavor atop orchard fruit and ripened bananas.  A great, full-flavored brew with added citrus hints.  Full body and medium- carbonation. My favorite BA Tripel thus far!",", Indiana, USA","FlandersNed"
