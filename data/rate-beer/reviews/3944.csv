3944,"2014-09-13",3.3,"Bottle at home. Pours golden with nose of sweet plums. Tastes of plum, rice, hint of apricot, and simple syrup. Not as thick and syrupy as some infused sakes go. Could be cleaner though.","New York, USA","Jow"

3944,"2012-01-15",3.1,"Bottle that we took to Andys New Years Eve party/tasting/Fluxx tournament.  Pours a clear yellow gold.  Smells a bit of salad dressing, savory and sweet.  Weird aromas.  Medium bodied, super sweet, toasty and warm, a touch of fruit.  Finishes with some lingering acidity and warmth.  Very odd.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

3944,"2010-04-02",3.4,"Bottled. A golden sake. The aroma has notes of plums, rice, and alcohol. The flavor is sweet with strong notes of fruits - plums and more on a back ground of rice and alcohol, leading to a fruity finish. Thanks yespr for sharing.","Citizen of the universe, DENMARK","Ungstrup"
3944,"2009-06-15",3.6,"Non-carbonated. Served chilled. Nice golden yellow color, like a white wine. Pleasing aroma with ever so slight pluminess to it. At first taste you clearly taste the sweetness of the plum extract, but it finishes with an unmistakable rice flavor to it. Body is nice. Not too thin, but not syrupy like some sakes can be. If it didnt have the rice aftertaste you might fool me into thinking this is a white wine w/plum in it. The first sake Ive had that Im likely to buy again!","Albany, California, USA","robertjm"
