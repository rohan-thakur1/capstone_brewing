2817,"2017-05-13",3.7,"On tap at the Redmond taproom Classic light pale golden. Mild lightly sweet and a fairly strong Pilsner noble hop bite. Clean dry finish .","Boise, Idaho, USA","IndianaRed"
2817,"2016-08-04",4.0,"got this super fresh directly from the brewer.  super bright yellow some bright white foam. Aroma grassy hops nutty grains. Super fresh, crisp crackers. Some rye like grain intensity. Very dry, almost resinous mouthfeel. lives up to the high rating.","Seattle, Alabama, USA","nealblind"
2817,"2015-06-12",3.5,"Draft pour at brewery, very lite golden pour, nice crisp flavor, really nice on a summer day. Not a huge fan of pilsner but I like this one.","Duvall, Washington, USA","tcon25"
2817,"2015-05-06",3.5,"650 ml bottle gifted by a buddy in a recent trip to the Seattle area. Clear gold color with thin head in proper glassware. Aroma is light honey like malt with a light grassy hop. 
The body is light with a higher carbonation level. Flavor starts with Pilsner malt sweetness, grain followed by the lightly grassy hop finish. The Saaz is fresh which makes all the difference in the world in this simple style. This beer has a nice clean finish and is very easy to drink. Nice example of the style.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
2817,"2014-09-01",3.0,"Bottle. Pours a mostly clear dark golden color with a fairly small white head on there. Nose has a lot of corn and hay in there for me. Taste is light and crisp, with a bit of corn coming off it. OK, but nothing all that special for me.","Snohomish, Washington, USA","maxwelldeux"
2817,"2014-08-31",3.4,"Bottle: &nbsp A very translucent straw, little head, lacing, and carbonation. &nbsp Very vibrant tho. &nbsp Big grassy nose, crackers, with some sweaty barnish notes. &nbsp Smooth on the tongue, grassy, nice balance, a touch of sweetness, almost crisp. &nbsp Very easy drinking. &nbsp Fairly full bodied for a Pils. &nbsp Wished it had a bit more sweetness zip at the finish, but as is its fairly damn good, and clean!","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
2817,"2014-05-19",4.2,"Im not a huge pilsner fan, but this one is solid for the style. Crisp and light, yet still quite flavorful. Thats usually the downfall of this style in my book -- not enough flavor. Here, its present.","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","mikedR"
2817,"2014-05-12",3.9,"22 oz bottle. Pours light with a grassy, slightly hoppy aroma. In my experience, a lot of pilsners dont have as much flavor as I had with this one. This being the case I really enjoyed this. Could potentially get me back in to the style. Bready flavor, with a little corn and some light hops. Very smooth refreshing beer to go with this nice sunny day. Great beer, get it while you can.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
2817,"2013-07-23",3.4,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2014 Tap at the brewery summer 2013. I came to this with hugely high hopes given the previous ratings, and the fact that its 85 degrees here in Seattle today, the cosmic equivalent of 99 in any other city in the country. Beautiful pour, gentle gold with a fluffy white head. But it comes off a bit thinner and more sour than Id expected, crackers through the middle, certainly very good but I dont get that Saaz snap that would put it anywhere near the 99th percentile for the style. 7/4/7/4/14=3.6

Revisit, growler 7/4/14.More biting hops and sticky alcohol, less grassy-refreshing than Id like. Id go more like 7/3/7/3/13=3.3 this time around. Ill split the difference.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
2817,"2013-07-05",3.8,"22. Pours a crystal clear lightly burnished medium gold with a loose and slightly creamy white head. Lots of lace. Big forward crackers and grass on the nose, forceful and dynamic to a degree too rarely seen among pilsners. Creamy light sparkling body, beautifully executed. Crackers and grass on the mid palate, just like you like to see. Nice dry finish.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
2817,"2013-06-23",3.5,"Bottle. Clear, pale, golden color with minimal head. Toast, biscuit, grass, and summer. Light carbonation, light body, smooth and refreshing. Crisp. Nice beer.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
2817,"2013-06-21",3.3,"Tenth rate. Lock this fucking thing in! Aroma of bread and cereal grain, a little sulfur, pepper, light grass, and earth. Pours golden like the fucking picture, thin head. Flavors of bread, sulfur, grain, a little pepper and a little grass, crisp, but with flabby carbonation. Not bad, but would definitely prefer a little more lively carbonation. Points for rareness and its awesome clientele and fanbase. Yay.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
2817,"2013-06-15",3.7,"Golden in color thin head with a good pils flavor and finish.  Nice hops crispness and dry finish.","Olympia, Washington, USA","BrewDad"
2817,"2012-07-29",4.2,"Very nice Pilsner.  Crisp and clean with a very nice hop character that leaves you wanting another taste.","Washington, USA","fognog"
2817,"2012-07-05",4.1,"On tap at the brewery, served in a tall footed pils glass.  Pours a brilliantly clear light straw color with effervescent bubbles climbing the nucleation points in the glass.  Thick foam, pure white and dense.  Strong pils malt aroma, biscuity and cracker-like, a bit of lager-like esthers that waft through the foamy cap.  Clean pilsner malt, rich and flavorful.  Smooth noble-like bitterness helps round out the sip.  Teeny bit of lemon-like citrus flavor comes through very cleanly.  Clean carbonation helps give a dry finish.  No off-flavors.  Would rate a bit higher but the body is a touch big.","Washington, USA","22415brewery"
2817,"2012-01-10",3.8,"22 oz bomber courtesy of bvc. Pour is a hazed yellow golden with a one inch clear white head. The head is quite full, falls slowly.  Aroma is soft bready toasted grain, along with bright floral and some grassy hay. The taste is bright grain, bready, balanced nicely with fresh floral hay.  Finishes with pleasant mineral earthiness. The palate is light to medium bodied, un filtered mouth feel, nice carbonation and a clean finish. Really liked this one, thanks Brandon.","Kansas, USA","theisti"
2817,"2010-09-11",4.1,"It would be hard to find a more perfect pilsner. Its not all that complex, as it probably shouldnt be for the style. Growler from the brewery pours a pure white head that leaves substantial, though fleeting lacing, above a golden body. The aroma reminds me of an alpine meadow spring bubbling up from the side of a trail just when you most need a cool fresh drink of water. Hints of wheat and lemons. Nicely carbonated, with flavors of sweet Texas grapefruit, biscuit, and maybe a dash of black pepper. Noticeably hop forward. Sparkly and tart finish leaves you wanting just one more glass. This is a real winner of a recipe. I cant wait to see how the guys tweak this one.","Austin, Texas, USA","ManvsCity"
2817,"2010-08-21",4.3,"This is a crystal clear golden lager with dense white head and nice lacey adherence to the glass. Great balance with a European hop profile. Crisp and refreshing, this pilsner has notes of fresh cut hay, black pepper and very subtle sweetness offset by pleasantly bittered hops.","Seattle, Washington, USA","WineBeerWA"
2817,"2010-07-22",4.2,"congrats karen. Gentle honey and soft dry grain. bright gold, stark white head and consistent steady cascade of carbonation. medium dryness, firm body, clean throughout with a balanced zesty crisp hoppy finish. I dont normally enjoy pils but I love this. love it.","Bothell, Washington, USA","scrizzz"
2817,"2010-07-21",3.9,"UPDATED: JUL 22, 2010 Growler from the brewery, drunk an hour after filling it.  Clear, light gold, bubbly pour with a big, lasting white head on it.  Aroma is light, with hay, dry herbal notes, a little pepper.  Lightly sweet malt body that tastes of grain, bread, and plain popcorn, finishing cleanly with hay, grass, pepper, earthiness.  Light, moderately carbonated body.  Im normally not a huge fan of pilsners, but this is pretty great to drink fresh in the warm weather.  Thumbs up.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Nena"
2817,"2010-07-20",3.6,"Draft at brewpub.  Pours a effervescent clear rich golden with tight white head and cascading lacing.  Hay, honey, peppery Nobel hops...very light and clean nose.  Crisp clean hay, grassy hops, peppery cracker, touches of honey sweetening.  Carbonation could use a touch more pressence, but this is very enjoyable with clean light flavor.","Washington, USA","bvc"
