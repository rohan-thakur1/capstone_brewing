Viscous, spicy, silky and smooth. Hoppy; balancing hop bitterness. Warming alcohol. Sweet-bitter roasty coffee and chocolate malty and fruity throughout. Complex. Lots of character.

3660,"2016-06-12",4.2,"APPEARANCE- Perfectly black with no head and no lacing. Very light brown color at the very edge of the thumbnail.
NOSE- STELLAR! Smells sweet and slightly boozy at the same time. Exactly as expected for a barrel aged and cellared beauty beer.
FLAVOR- first thing that hits me is its surprisingly thin. The nose is deceptive compared to the flavor. The flavor is distinctively stout, but significantly lighter in nature than youd expect for the way it smells and looks. Really good beer, however I was anticipating a much heavier beer.","Lee, Massachusetts, USA","bnokk"

3660,"2010-12-14",3.2,"2010-12-03. Viscous black body, near headless. 3+ Strong flavour of alcohol and whiskey is a bit off-putting. Nice malty base but the alcohol and whiskey really dominates the flavour profile. Aroma is similar, alcohol, whiskey, light barrel notes. 6+ Smooth medium bodied is accompanied by a mild alcohol burn throughout. Solid, its a bit disappointing.

3660,"2010-02-09",4.2,"A Mes rate. Cask at the Rake.Black brown, totally opaque, no head what-so-ever. It still looks pretty inviting though. Amazing aroma. A truck load of burnt caramel and chocolate, hints of vanilla and leather and a good 30 year vintage undertone. The flavour is full on creamy chocolate and whisky. The caramel and vanilla are there along with some dark fruit. Slight peaty hit in the finish and a good deal of the Highland Park showing through. Hints of seaweed and over ripe plum in the aftertaste. Actually, the aftertaste is what makes it. Its sublime. Amazing length and giving up more of everything it has to offer. Certainly better than the bottled version. Bloody excellent stuff. Really smooth and dare I say it, downable. Im really struggling to get this rate out quick enough.
