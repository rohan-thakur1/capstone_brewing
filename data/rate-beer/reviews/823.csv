823,"2011-10-29",3.5,"A: Pale yellow body. Crystal clear. Moderate sized white head. Nice and fluffy. Decent retention with some spotty lacing left on the sides of the glass.

S: Grassy, with some citrus and a subtle slightly sweet toasty malt base.

T: Very much like the nose, a toasted malt cracker like base is accentuated by a grassy - citrus bitterness. A little more hop flavor and depth would have done wonders here.

M: Light to medium bodied. Assertive carbonation. You can taste some booze through it all. Semi-dry finish. Not super refreshing, but a nice crispness is here.

O: A decent brew, but it doesnt quite capitalize on all that can be done within the style. The hoppiness isnt distinctive enough here. (review from 2010)","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

823,"2010-12-31",3.4,"Cloudy orange, smallish head. Sweet, fruity aroma. Flavor is not as sweet as the aroma suggests. Theres kind of a weird earthy flavor in there, as well. Its heavy, too.

Nose is honey, malt, hops, summer fruit, rain, and an odd clean smell.  Taste is very similar, but there is a delicious caramel apple flavor that rolls in to a fruity hop finish.

823,"2010-10-23",3.6,"Bomber from Sams, Durham. As much as I wanted to dislike this beer - not simply because of the brewers kinda sophomoric tendencies but because, of all the crappy 1980s shows to frost with faux irony, its gotta be THIS one? - I actually dug it. Pours a translucent deep gold with moderate carbonation. Very fruity nose, but hops fruity. Mouthfeel is a bit oily, and when the beer aspires most closely to bitters it can get oddly soapy. But yeah, its pretty good.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","JCB"

Head is large, frothy white with excellent creamy and thick lacing, and is mostly lasting. Color starts out hazy but clears up to be clear amber. Flavor starts moderately sweet and lightly acidic, then finishes lightly sweet and moderately bitter.

Grassy hop notes fill the nose with some bread notes and lots of banana.  Medium body with a general sweetness along with a generous earthy bitterness.  Really nice bitter finish with some more light fruit notes.  This is one hoppy Imperial Pils and drinks very well - however, it really doesnt feel like a 100 IBU beer.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","craftbeerdesign"
823,"2010-08-22",3.2,"A: The pour is a golden color with a slight haze and a big white head.

S: The nose is a nice mix of sweet, lightly bready, malt notes and earthy and herbal hops. The sweetness is really pronounced, though, and at times a bit sugary.

T: Plenty of sweetness on the tongue as well. Lots of honey like flavors, a bit of bread, and some soft bitterness. The hops tend to be a bit faint overall.

M: A fairly decent body for a pilsner, so there is certainly a bit of imperial nature there. Moderate carbonation to go along with it.

D: This one was just too sweet for me. It wasnt really all that bad, but I would have preferred a more noticeable hop aroma and flavor to balance out the sugar and malt flavor.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

823,"2010-08-08",3.5,"10 ounce goblet - $7.00 at Taco Mac in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Dispensed into a simple-looking, everyday goblet a near clear, light copper body with a finger of off-white head.

Smell: German malts in the aroma, primarily good ole pilsner, with some grainy hints and a touch of honey. Citrusy, spicy, mildly floral hops. A few traces of nose tingling alcohol.

Taste: Pilsner malts in the fore with a toasted barley character and sweet hints of honey bear-type honey and golden syrup. A shock of earthy, spicy hops, then a splash of neutral grain spirits, then a citric hoppiness and a solid dose of bitterness. Peppery alcohol tones precede the dry, weighty, bitter finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-plus, languid body. Medium carbonation.

Drinkability: So many amped up lagers these days, what gives? The alcoholic nature of the brew and the cumbersome body make it a task to finish, even at only ten ounces. Though, with more and more of these imperialized pilsners hitting the market, it is pretty much the norm for the style.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"
823,"2010-08-07",2.4,"Bottle thanks to AndyHazy gold pour, fluffy white head with scattered lacing. Watery grain nose of bubblegum, wheat, and corn, overly sweet and a bit.

Nose is bready malts and grassy hops... maybe a kiss of honey and some gentle banana notes as well.  Did I really just write ""gentle banana""???

823,"2010-07-31",3.4,"Pours a murky orange-straw into the glass, with a sudsy white head that reduces to a 1/4-inch ring leaving soapy lace.  The aromas are of cooking sweet yellow corn-on-the-cob and musty basement notes.  Flavors are similar, of definitive corn, but not in a macro way; more like canned yellow-white corn soaked in water.  Malts make their way in a bit, and the sugary sweetness of the corn turns directly into a lightly peppering hop finish.  The mouthfeel is syrupy, with integrated carbonation.  The corn can make this slightly cloying and sweet at times, and it is nowhere near a pils that I can taste (other than written ingredients), but is certainly an interesting brew to rate, and a rare style offering.  Not the greatest offering overall, but it definitely piqued my interest.","Swannanoa, North Carolina, USA","bubbleflubber"

823,"2010-07-22",3.8,"Pours an exceptionally clear golden amber with a creamy off-white head that leaves a bit of lacing on the way down.

The aroma is lightly sweet with toasted pale malts and some earthy and floral hops mixed in.  It seems a bit lighter and grainier than some of the crazy sweet IPs Ive smelled lately.

The taste is really nice and very well balanced for the style.  Its got the sweet malt backbone but doesnt get overly sweet.  There is a nice grassy hop character and a tingling spiciness on the tongue.

The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied for the style with good carbonation and not syrupy in the least.

Ive actually had a few different IPs lately and this one is probably the best.  It is undoubtedly the most drinkable as the sweetness isnt overdone and the hops are a major factor in the taste.  Well done Sweetwater.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

823,"2010-07-18",3.5,"Clear golden color with a quickly dissipating white head. Plenty o bubbles coming up through the glass. Bit of a c-hop citrus kind of aroma a little forward for an imperial pils but sticking to the brewers hop profile. A little candi sugar sweetness in the aroma as well.

A medium bodied drink that fades into a citrus hop mid palate drink and a nicely sweet finish.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"
823,"2010-07-15",3.2,"Bomber from Bruisin. Finally a pilsener with American hops thrown in! Great idea and so obviously Sweetwater. The pour is dark gold, light orange with a small head.  Aroma is kind of underwhelming for what I expected.  Perhaps some effective dry hopping would help out. The nose is a little grassy with a sour bread note and crackers. Id love more hops overall.  The flavor is very doughy and yeasty with a sour twang I associate with many lagers.  Its a little metallic but I do get some fair citrus notes around.  When it comes to anything with pils in the title, I need boatloads of hops and a crisp, dry finish. This was okay, I guess.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
823,"2010-07-14",3.9,"The body was clear, and was a shade of rich golden.  The beer formed a gigantic head in the Wei\zen glass upon pouring, and it took a few minutes to settle down to drinkable composition.  The smell was quite malty and reminded me of several beers with honey in them.  There was tinge of grassy hops in the smell as well.  The taste was soft and malty as suspected, with sweet honey like taste predominant, followed by a spicy and herbal bitter note.  The finish was dry and slightly vegetal. The body was very soft and smooth, making this quite easy to drink.  The bottle did say this was supposed to be 100 IBUs, but it never tasted all that bitter.  The alcohol was quite deceptive due to the easygoing nature of the experience.  I would have preferred this to be more overtly bitter, but it was a tasty affair as it was.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

823,"2010-07-07",3.6,"Very impressive craftmanship here. Im not saying this is the greatest beer ever. Im just saying that taking a pale lager to 9 percent is a really easy endeavor to really screw up and this is definitely not screwed up. The body is a rich gold with a very slight greenish cast that seems common in really good pilsners to me. The aroma suggests that the Sterling hops were more of a factor than the Cascades, although there is a slightly American quality to the hop bouquet. Nice straw malt like youd expect from a Pilsner, but sweeter than a pilsner should be. No off flavors. Perhaps a touch rich for session drinking, but actually a good attempt at a strong lager.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

Citrus hops start in the flavor, followed by some floral hops, pine, fruit, sweet malt in the middle and a strong bitter finish with a fair bit of heat from the alcohol, but the bitterness ultimately does win the battle.  Medium bodied, medium carbonation, somewhat sticky and syrupy.  A damned good Imperial Pils.  Havent had many from this style, definitely like this one better than Uber Pils.  Need to try Sam Adams Hallertau again when it comes out this year.","Ringgold/Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia, USA","elgiacomo"
823,"2010-07-02",3.7,"22 oz. bottle from Macs on West Peachtree. The head went from nice and fluffy to thin and wispy. The beer is transparent and has a decent looking copper color to it. I was going to pour this into a Terrapin glass, but that would addle my Terrapin shaker and I would be fucked and have nothing to live for. There seems to be a subtle mixture of light fruit, grass, and pilsner malts that Im smelling. Its not extremely pungent, but sufficient for the style. Im with Mr. SSSteve on this one, I dont think its coming close to 100 IBUs, but I will say there is a pleasant bitterness that lingers. Great pilsner taste that has a great depth to it. To me this beer has a light pine hop flavor with a light spicy kick to ""spice"" things up. The more I taste this the more my taste buds are shocked. Spicy qualities work well with the bitterness. Quite easy to drink, if you ask me. Overall, this is fairly good. The ""battle"" between Boom Shaka Lager and this will have to be decided by the masses. I will say that this has a lighter spicy kick to it, where Terrapin seems to weigh in more on the fruit. Slight presence of alcohol that warms me up. The texture is quite nice.","Portland (Sellhood), Oregon, USA","CheersMate"
823,"2010-07-02",3.4,"22oz bottle.  hazy gold under a medium sized, whipped, yellow/white head.  a peppery lager aroma with corn nachos main.  flavor is moderately sweet with liquid corn chips and a drop of perfume and pear.  the 9% is remarkably well hidden.  it drinks incredibly smooth.  100 ibus?? no way.","","SSSteve"
823,"2010-07-01",3.9,"Bomber from Greens on Ponce.  Poures clear and golden.  1/2 finger bright white head faded quickly.  Surprisingly left some nice lace on the glass.  Aroma is lots of bready malt and some hay.  The taste is quite a turnaround.  Starts off with some bread and quickly yields to some super smooth hop flavors.  Awesome finish.  Leaves a sticky hop prescence on the tounge that lasts.  Slick, smooth and full mouthfeel, nice carbonation.  Bitterness is there, nice and balancing.  Alcohol is nonexistent.  This stuff could lead to trouble.  Awesome stuff.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","mixmasterob"
823,"2010-07-01",4.1,"22oz bottle.Pours a pale yellow with a foamy white head.Nose is lemony with citrus hop aromas as well.Taste is crisp and bready up front with a huge hop backbone that finishes just bitter enough.This is a really good beer,perfect for the summer.The alcohol is pretty well masked making this a great sipper for sure.As the beer warms you feel every bit of the 100 IBUs...wow I really like this beer and its getting better as I make my way through it..","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","randy1301"
