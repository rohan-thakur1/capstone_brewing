The flavor is boozy and astringent at first. The mouthfeel is prickly and highly carbonated. The flavor has ripe apple, booze, a mild bitterness, and some liqueur-like caramel. It is decent the longer you sip, it reminds me of an amber ale that has sat for a bit, but the hotness makes me think it isnt that old. It is a pretty decent one in the flavor.

Pours a slightly hazed reddish-amber color with a huge, lasting, foamy white head.

The aroma is...brett?  Really?  Didnt expect that.  Besides that, there are floral hop notes and sweet hints of malt.

The flavor is definitely bretty and funky, slightly sour.  Not sure whether that was intended or not.  Besides that, there is caramel malt and a considerable hop bite that is herbal and ESB-like with some floral and grapefruit notes.  Alcohol is a little more assertive than it probably should be at 7.5%.  The finish is earthy and ever so slightly metallic.

Medium-bodied with some acidity on the palate and high carbonation from the infection and/or intentional addition of brett.

Taste is a floral caramel maltiness out of the gate, followed by sweet honey floral and then the straw earthiness of the Brett. Aftertaste features spicy clove, garlic and pepper.

4349,"2009-09-23",2.7,"I dont know, I guess when Im told Im about to drink an original recipe IPA I expect something less refined and more provincial. I wanted a stronger hop flavor, and an unbalanced malt character. You know, something imperfect, but perfect at the same time because you know they were tinkering with a new stye of ale: just trying to make it not spoil on the way to their imperial holdings. Overall Im not really impressed, and feel that Ive outgrown most British ales (with a few exceptions of course). It might also be a problem that Ive been living in the Pacific Northwest for the last five years and expect my IPAs to burn the skin off the inside of my mouth. Therein lies my bias. Ten years ago this might have been my favorite beer. 

That being said, the beer is beautiful to look at. Giant frothy head, and a dark amber color reminiscent of fall and German Hefs. For some reason Im also into how fizzy it is; again probably due to my overindulgence in thick, flat porters and heavy double IPAs. Right now though, Im enjoying it. Theres also a long spicy burn that coats your mouth, kinda like McDonalds french fries. Lardy? Can I really describe the mouthfeel as lardy? Why not. Sour beer fans might also find an appreciation of this brew. Normally not into sour beers, I like the long sour apple drag this beer has. Its weird, I like the beers aftertaste more than the initial forefront flavors. Weird.","Washington, USA","jamespgentry"
4349,"2009-08-31",4.3,"What would you say is the newest fad for American brewers?  I would say hoppy brett beers, I had a few at BCTC recently and GABF before that.  Unfortunately, they all suck.  The problem, they arent looking at the examples that are out there, like Orval or this beer.  Now I am not saying this beer and Orval are the same or even too similar but they are both able to combine hops and brett in a wonderful marriage, yet take different routes.  Unfortunately, the American brewers are taking the route off the end of the cliff. Now on with this beer...The beer pours with a beautiful thick, large, and frothy white head.  This sits atop a thick orange-golden-amber colored body.  The body is very hazy but yet some of the carbonation is visible. Light radiates but I cannot see through it completely.  A very pretty beer.  Aroma is strong on a mix of brett and hops and it works because both are well balanced.  It comes of as strong, herbal, tropical citrus fruit.  Thats the combination of that barnyard pineapple and a citrus and herbal hoppiness. Its strong and aggressive on the nose yet acceptable on the senses. There is an underlying biscuit aspect, even if it is a tropical biscuit, its still that English biscuit malt.  The flavor is an easy passing tropical fruitiness with a faintly lactic aftertaste.  A really easy drinking brewing full of flavor and character.  A lightly spritzy mouthfeel and effervesce make this beer flow away like the spirits.  Yet an underlying fruity lactic character remains for a long while like a ghoul haunting a house. If I pour the beer a little less than properly the head expands like a fat chick at a bon-bon convention. Lots of slurry at the bottom of the bottle representing the bottle conditioning. 500mL bottle poured into La Fin Du Monde tulip glass, no date.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

Looking back on my noted for Tickle Brain by this brewer, I got the same aroma for that beer as well. Maybe its the yeast? Very apple-fruit driven flavour as well, yeasty, vaguely spicy, bitter. Some fusels. Mouthfeel is very carbonated, such that it is as though youve gulped foam. Im waaaay against the grain on this one (92nd percentile for style?

4349,"2009-03-06",4.6,"Drinking regularly - Feb/March 2009.  Stunning ale that has it all.  Big creamy head, atop a hazy gold volcano, with complex perfumery of floral and fruit esters and spicy/grassy hops. Huge hop flavour, carried well by the soft malt sweetness and creamy mouthfeel. Bitter but balanced. A unique island of yeast-malt-hop complexity amongst a plethora of ""clean"" American style hoppy ales here in NZ.  Golden magic!

Orange-gold, nearly bright and lightly effervescent, with a just off-white head that thins and laces exquisitively.  Pungent perfumey nose: nectarine, old-style oranges, pollen and a touch of caramel. Sweet juicy malt up front; strong pollen-like yeast notes, quite minerally and fruity; then a stonefruit and orange tanginess that suggests a huge amount of dry hops; a little warming alcohol; strong bitterness with an iron-like intensity that lingers in the finish.

RERATE Rosetted bottle BB October 09. Sharp Bretty aroma of screaming juice, horse sweat, lily pollen and apricots; dung-dappled edginess and a sliver of Brie evoking De Ranke, Drie Fonteinen, Orval... interesting, and nothing like expected. Some serious funk and a little chlorine.TCP harshness in the first sips, rounding out with custard, apple and cinammon-like spice. Disinfectant, bread and Bazooka chews. Brassy deep gold with a billow of foam. The hops are a touch too astringent, the alcohol a notch too high but the lingering biscuit and yeast character is what really makes this an intriguing and Belgian-inflected IPA, with a nod toward Orval.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"

4349,"2006-09-02",3.6,"Murky yellow/dark yellow body with three or four finger thick white head.  Smells skunky initially (Which would make sense with the importing and the amount of hops...)  But seems to wear off (hopefully this one wont be skunked!), and theres a light sweet scent with a hint of hops... A little skunk in the taste.  Without the skunk, theres a fair bit of malt (fruitiness too perhaps?) with enough hops to balance it out.  While it would be so much better if it did not have that skunk factor, this would be far and away one of the best IPAs I have ever ever tried.  The non-skunked flavors are fantastic.   Thus I give it a higher rating than the product I have in front of me really earns, but probably lower than it would be fresh... If you can find this on tap or fresh somewhere, get it!

4349,"2006-01-25",4.8,"""The sun never sets on the Empire"". And indeed, in Britains Empire days, it never did, Britain had colonies that spanned the globe. India was one such colony. British troops stationed in India needed their daily beer, and the pale ales of Burton on Trent answered the call. But India was a long way from England, pale ale would spoil on that long sea voyage, and trips over land. What was a brewer to do? The answer? Take that famous Burton pale ale, brew it to a higher gravity giving it more alcohol, and add generous additions of hops to act as a preservative. This hoppy, potent brew becomes very popular among the British troops stationed in India, and a sub style of pale ale is born. This beer is now called India Pale Ale. 

The Burton Bridge Brewery, of Burton on Trent, in the village of Staffordshire, England brewes a historical version of India Pale Ale. Empire India Pale Ale attempts to simulate what this beer might have tasted like to one of those British troops. This beer is a very strong pale ale, with a really firm pale malt body, and a very aggressive hop character. This beer is a real ale it is conditioned for six months in the cask(the average length of the sea voyage), and then is bottle conditioned as well, with the addition of more yeast. This has to be the hoppiest British India Pale Ale, I belive I have ever tasted. It just explodes with British, EKG hop aromas and flavors. 

Empire India Pale Ale pours to a deep orange color with a rocky, thick white head, and a very lively carbonation. This beer is bottle conditioned, you have to pour carefully, you do not want to pour any of the yeast sediment in to your beer. The nose is the first thing that really impresses. I could literally smell the very fragrant floral hop character as I was pouring this beer. This beer is dry hopped by the bail loads. The nose is very aromatic with hop character, coupled with some pungent yeasty aromas as well. The palate is a very firm malt backbone, really nice biscuit like pale malt flavors mingle with some sweet caramel malt flavor. There is also a vinous character to this beer on the tongue, and again, a slight back drop of yeast flavor. This beer finishes with sweet maltiness up front, then dries with some really nice zesty hop bitterness, and a soothing, slightly warm alcohol burn. This beer weighs in at 7.5% avb, the proper strength of India Pale Ale.

An exceptional British tribute to what India Pale Ale must have really tasted like in the Empire days. This beer would be perfect match to spicy Indian fare, and would work really well with fish and chips. I was very impressed with this beer, hands down, the hoppiest BIPA I have ever tasted. The only knock on this beer is it is a bit pricey. This beer is imported by Beverage United, and I paid $4.99 for a 22 oz bottle. I think a beer as rare and special is worth it. Treat yourself to a taste of the Empire, and seek this beer out.","DC Metro Area, USA","TheBeerLover"

Citrusy on the tongue, tart with those generous drying out orange flavors. Funky (leather, hay) and delicious flavor development containing a warming kiss of alcohol as it warms. Ive never had something this uniquely yeasty from england. Moderately high carbonation, round powdery medium-full body. Quite salty toward the end.

Seemed much more sweet in the mouth, with the hop flavour obviously diminishing with age but still quite noticable, had developed something of a perfumed triple fruitiness as well.

4349,"2004-07-13",3.8,"Bottled.This was a strange brew indeed. I started out not liking it very much but enjoyed it quite a bit towards the end. Upon opening it was extremely carbonated and slowly gushed for 3 minutes before I decided to pour it.  The flavor, aroma, and texture were quite harsh and not at all pleasant (smelled like a dirty dishrag for one thing).  However once it warmed up and lost some carbonation its character changed and became quite pleasing, almost like a very mild and sweet lambic.  The following then is what I experienced and rated when the beer de-gassed for a bit and warmed up to 60F:  
No head and no lacing at all; nice hazy med-gold color.Aroma was sweet and fruity layered with a hint of bubblegum, a subtle oaky ""brettiness"", and a very present alcohol character. Off-dry, malty start; fruity mid-palate with some oakiness; finish was also off-dry with an assertive bitterness that carried into the aftertaste.  The aftertaste had an interesting dry, husky malt character, akin to having chewed on a few grains of barley malt.  Palate was med-full with a creamy, almost oily texture. So, to fully enjoy this beer I recommend letting it de-gas and warm up before drinking it.","San Francisco, California, USA","Flipbrewer"

Hazy pour of yellow-orange beer with an average sized white head. Bubblegum and honey in the aroma. Sweet malty flavor is sorely needing a dose of hops to bring it back into balance.

The pour is a little funny, it sounded like a soda pop all cracklin' and the head had tiny little bubles that fizzed for a bit. It called down and actually maintained some of the head quite well.

The aroma is sweet but sour fruits, sour cherries, apples, pears, and peaches (?).

Tastes like stewed cherries and apples with minimal spices mostly warm subdued fruit flavors. This to me, doesn't taste like a Pale Ale thats bigger with more hops it just tastes like a pale ale with different hops, it's not big at all.

Strong fruity (pear and apple), slightly tart aroma.  Medium bodied.  Very unique and interesting flavor.  Fruity and malty.","Virginia, USA","sntckr"
4349,"2003-03-21",3.2,"This iis the hoppiest IPA from Britain I've ever tasted. Resin hops and malt liquor alcohol flavors compete all the way. Big ass head can't wait to get out so open these in a safe place. Worth trying.","Da U.P. eh?, Michigan, USA","I.C.suds"

4349,"2003-02-18",2.2,"Best before 3-03. Orange colored, with bits of yeast floating through the beer. Aroma has apple, vanilla and oak and is slightly acidic. Malty flavor with hops and some apple. The alcohol is prominent and there is a rough vinegar-like sour edge to this beer. Maybe some wild yeast has spoiled the fun.","La Tropica, NETHERLANDS","bierkoning"
4349,"2003-02-12",2.6,"This thing came bursting out of the bottle! Nice hazy orange color with a massive white head. This beer does not seem to ressemble any IPA I've ever had. The aroma was fruity, sweet, yeasty, and with a bit of clove. The flavor was very sweet with a burning alcohol taste. The alcohol in this dominated everything else, and in my opinion, ruined this beer. I would never classify this as an IPA, but I don't really know what I would call it.","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"
4349,"2003-02-12",4.2,"This one pours a cloudy amber color with a small off-white head. Very strong aroma that is slightly sour, alcoholic, and malty with a hint of hops. Medium bodied with a very interesting flavor. It has a malty, bready flavor with a slight sourness and earthy hoppiness in the finish. It has some fruity yeast flavors to it as well. Quite an interesting beer, very complex and unlike any other IPA I have tried.","Greenville, South Carolina, USA","Uglyradio"

Very sour with a bitter metallic charactor.  Very acidic all the way through, medium bodied, balanced well.","Amherst, Massachusetts, USA","Hopistotle420"

Highly hopped, but with golding, which gives it a bitterness that is more like hay or grass(what I term earthy).  Good Brew.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"

4349,"2002-12-18",4.4,"Billowing dirty white foam erupts from the glass, turning chunky and sticky.  Highly perfumed aroma, wich also emits smelly hay, fresh flowers, musty wood, lemon, sweet tart, pepper, apricot, green onion, medicine, and leather.  Only the vaguest sign of a round hop charcacter underneathe the  Belgian funkiness.  Spritzy on the palate, and semi-full; slightly round.  Some  serious signs of craftsmanship in the flavor department, which exude intense medicinal notes, hint of wood,  melon, and apples.  Then comes, what seems like, a second finish, showing long notes of stinky malt and toasty bread.  Accompanying, is a fine dryness and a mildly aggressive acidic sharpness.  The finishing malt profile is exquisite.  Are these guys using open fermenters and bacteria, along with wood casks?  A masterpiece without question.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
4349,"2002-12-06",4.0,"Hazy light amber /orange. Huge big bubbled rocky head and somewhat sticky lace. Big aroma of funky horseblanket, slight cheese, citrus, malt, grassy/herbal hops and others. Almost medium bodied, moderate carbonation, big grassy/citrus hoppy flavors. Nice somewhat sweet malts riding in the backseat. Amazing sour yeast qualities mesh with the hops beautifully. Drying finish with a bit of alcohol poking through. Damn tasty, complex and reminicent of Orval. Unlike any IPA I ever had. Thank you ecrvich.","Hamburg, New York, USA","jayme9874"

4349,"2002-11-23",3.4,"Huge, foamy head. Big, yeasty nose. Sour, citric, and acidic aroma. Malt seems a little underbalanced behind the alcohol. Wet hay, bread dough, and green malt describes the flavor. Yeast is the star in this beer; everything else sits in the back seat -- on the hump. One of those love or hate beers... but I happen to be on the fence. Ha.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"

4349,"2002-11-06",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2016 Bottle. Head is initially huge, frothy/creamy, rocky, off-white, fully lasting. Body is hazy dark yellow to light amber, bottle conditioned. Aroma is moderately malty (toasted bread, cookie), moderately hoppy (apricot, grapefruit), moderately yeasty (barnyard, horseblanket, cobwebs), with notes of fruitcake, lemon peel, oak, grape, band-aid. Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Finish is lightly sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately to heavily bitter. Medium to full body, velvety texture, lively carbonation. Englands version of Orval, quite simply.  Bretty/farmy/oaky aroma, huge lasting head, lots of yeast character (yet balanced with the malt and hop notes), etc.  Complex and remarkably elegant for being so rustic. An amazing beer, truly. Have only had one ho-hum bottle in all the years Ive been sampling it (very young/fresh bottles may not have as much yeast-driven characters). An IPA that can age quite well.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
4349,"2002-10-29",3.2,"Sherbert aroma with a citric zing.  Quite a cloudy appearance with a short lasting head after the initial explosion out of the bottle.  The lemon flavour overpowers the bitterness.  Overall I was expecting better from the beer.","Leicestershire, ENGLAND","RichardGretton"
4349,"2002-10-09",3.8,"wowee - big strong hop punch in this one - quite startling!  Body is thick, some sweet, fruity malts.  Humongus head - could only pour it a little bit at a time.  Excellent!","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
4349,"2002-09-29",3.0,"UPDATED: JAN 7, 2004 Opening the bottle sent beer gushing all over the place.  I hate when that happens.  It's a miracle that my keyboard still works fine after having so much beer land in it.  Anyway...It looks nice with its lacy head and cloudy dark orange color, but I found it totally lacking in taste.  Maybe my bottle was old (but since they is no date on the bottle I don't know), but I got only a faint musty hops taste and aroma from it.  Nice creamy mouthfeel.","Manchester, New Hampshire, USA","Volgon"
4349,"2002-09-25",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2003 Mine is 4 months away from its best before date and it tastes like a traditional pale ale with grapefruit flavours - not much in the way of sweetness, but plenty in the way of bitter hops. A very lively beer (even though it had rested for a month it spilled over in a most spectacular fashion when opened), this is very refreshing and quite tasty. [3.2]   And again... Bottle Conditioned. Best Before May 2003 - that's 7 months ago. Rising foam as before. This had been kept upright in a cool place for a year. I had gently popped it into the fridge to lower the temperature - and it still foamed up. The head settles to a 1/2 inch thickness, and remains there like a foam mattress. Aroma is malty, musty, oaky, sweet, Belgian, a touch of chocolate, some oxidisation, woody - pleasantly attractive without being too seductive. It smells like a vintage ale. Mouthfeel is good - medium to full, but with just too much lively carbonation giving a harshness that is almost unpleasant, but not quite. Taste is very good. Dark tangy flavours. The malt shifts around, not quite settling on a readily identifiable flavour, though chocolate is the most urgent image. Cardboard is there as well, but not unpleasantly - more like a cookie cardboard than a damp, nasty cardboard. There is sweetness moving around amongst the bitterness. The carbonation prevents a detailed flavour journey, though when the final foamy bubbles have died away a lingering licorice is the reward. A very interesting, tasty and rewarding ale that obviously behaves differently depending on age and storage conditions. Though mine was clearly beyond the age at which the brewer felt comfortable, the aging had brought out soft, malty complexities not apparant in the younger version. I upped all points except palate - though I may have given the first sample too many points anyway (4). The more I drink this, the more I like it!","Southampton, United Kingdom, Hampshire, ENGLAND","SilkTork"
4349,"2002-08-07",4.1,"Excessive foam, slightly hazed orange body. Well conditioned with fine streams of carbonation. Aroma is malty, yeasty, spicy and fruity. Light unobtrusive carbonation, great smoothness. Great fruitiness: orange, peach, apricot, mostly from yeast while there is some bitter quenching citrus in the finish thats below the USIPA scale but balances perfectly. I noticed a few comments below that didnt like this. For me it was the rawness and yeastiness that make this truly original. Im always glad to find an IPA with a difference.","California, USA","BeerLimey"
4349,"2002-07-26",3.5,"Amber/Orange colour w/ a cork-like suspention. Massive head. Quite Fragrant, flowery, fruity (apples?), peppery, hopsack nose. Oilyt, resiny feel. Taste: Dry, warm (alcohol), spicy, leafy, orangy, developing dry, bitter finish. Not to chrisp or sharp.","Waterdown, Ontario, CANADA","joeycapps"
4349,"2002-07-15",2.7,"Rich fruity peachy and some grassy aromas.  Hazy gold-amber and large off-white bubbly head.  Sharp and acidic in the mouth, more peach fruit in the flavor.  Med bitter finish but not really strongly hopped at all.  Strong alcohol presence.  Messy.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"
4349,"2002-06-03",3.6,"This beer attacks your tongue with bubbles the second you try to take a sip.  Remarkable.  The head is foamy as hell - as if youd just put the beer in the Cuisinart.  A hop tour-de-force, this is.  The English chaps on the label are smiling like I was when I first tasted this.  A quirky surprise - not bad.  Reading the few bad reviews, I wonder why my experience was so different from theirs.  Mine wasnt sour at all or lacking in hops.  Discrepancies between beers is, in my mind, a sign of poor quality control.","New York, New York, USA","austinpowers"
4349,"2002-05-28",4.3,"One of my favorite IPAs.  Almost orange in color.  Hopsack aromas.  With strong spicy hops flavors of pepper and orange.  Caramel and pale malt flavors come through as the beer warms.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

Nice foamy head, beautiful taste with nice bubbles that lasted on the tongue, and what a great hoppy aroma.  At first I thought a little pricey, but it was worth every penny.  This beer has definitely gotten my interest renewed in IPAs.  Amazing that an English Ale can taste this good and hold its content from 1st sip to last.","Portsmouth, New Hampshire, USA","rosebud"
