767,"2016-02-04",3.9,"Bottle, almost opaque dark brown beer, nice cream colored head, some lace. Aroma dark malts, chocolate, cloves, dark fruit and honey. Taste is honey, dates, cloves, chocolate, fig, coconut. Palate is pretty light, carbonation average. Drinks a bit like a Baltic Porter. This all comes together with lots of flavor, not too sweet, and high drinkability. This is a winner!","Eagle River, Alaska, USA","furthur"

767,"2015-12-31",4.1,"While it looks like a Dunkelweizen, it tastes and smells just like a Hefeweizen. I love the clove/banana aroma and taste. Really nice job, John Marra!","","Cousin_Larry"
767,"2015-12-27",3.0,"Bottled. Poured coppery-amber with a short-lived head. The aroma picked up sweet banana and nutty notes with light accents of cocoa and vanilla. The flavor found semi-sweet cocoa, caramel, and overripe banana at the core with peppery notes and prickly carbonation around. Light-medium bodied and scratchy on the palate.. only OK feel.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
767,"2015-12-10",2.4,"Bot, somewhat difficult brew. Could use some manners. Youd never know this was dunk weiz unless I saw the label; was thinking a helles or something, but what do I know? Glad to see its dunkel weizen but was expecting something a little more civilized. Fairly mild but keeps a little kick in the alky. And yea I guess the wheat starts to come thru on the finish.","Beaver Valley, Beaver County, Pennsylvania, USA","cheap"

767,"2015-11-17",3.5,"Bottle pour into pint glass from Cigarette City, Seabrook, NH. Aroma is strong banana, fruity esters. Appearance is hazy reddish brown with nice sparkle, 1/2 finger-width head with poor persistence and minimal lacing. Taste is as aroma with some bread and cereal, late clove. Palate is light bodied with thin texture and lively carbonation (a bit too much of a zing to the tongue) and sweet fruity and slight cereal and clove finish. Overall, some nice flavors and aroma but not as complex as advertised. A little too carbonated.","Fremont, New Hampshire, USA","tfontana"

767,"2015-10-02",3.3,"Nice dark brown coloured body with a little muddy glow of brown and a nice two centimetre tall tan head. Aroma of yeast, wheat and sugars with a bit of fruit noticeable. Medium-bodied; Assertive malty flavours coupled with the pit fruits and a smooth caramel finish, still showing a lot of malt and earth. Aftertaste is robust with the yeast and wheat really noticeable, also with some pit fruits, some earth, some nuts and a touch of grapes. Aftertaste is nice and rich with the malt really the first thing that sticks around, but also showing a faint sweetness. Overall, a good beer, but perhaps not one of the best dunkelweizens out there - still a worthy shot and a good try all around.

Not much aroma. Taste is yeasty with just touch of sour and slight spicy notes. I didnt get the expected banana. Dark Night is not a bad take on a traditional German style.","Orlando, Florida, USA","sloshgator"
767,"2015-08-01",3.5,"Mixed sixer purchased at CBC, Portsmouth location. Dark mahogany color, slowly fading head on the liquid. Aroma is mild banana, clove, caramel.

767,"2015-07-26",4.0,"12 ounce bottle into weizen glass, best before 10/2015. Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red/brownish color with a 2 finger dense and fluffy off white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the head. Aromas of banana, bubblegum, clove, pear, apple, caramel, wheat, toast, brown bread, light chocolate/nuttiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of banana, bubblegum, clove, pear, apple, caramel, wheat, toast, brown bread, light chocolate/nuttiness, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Light herbal/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of banana, bubblegum, clove, caramel, wheat, toast, brown bread, light chocolate/nuttiness, and herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Damn nice complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; with a great malt/yeast spice balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth and fairly creamy/bready mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with zero warming present after the finish. Overall this is a damn nice dunkelweizen style. All around great complexity, robustness, and balance of fruity/earthy yeast and dark/bready malt flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink. A very enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

Appearance: Pours a clear, medium brown body with a small-sized, very short-lived, near white head.

Smell: Predominately toasty, just a tad nutty. Faint caramel, chocolate, though it comes out a bit more upon warmth. Minor spice element. Slight banana and a little dark fruitiness. 

Taste: A taste of toasted grain (a bit nutty), a thin, faint edge of roastiness with sweetish hints of caramel and cocoa. A modest pinch of spices, a bit of banana and raisin. Light hop character and supporting bitterness. Still a bit nutty on the lightly sweetish finish.
