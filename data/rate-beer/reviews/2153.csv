2153,"2017-05-13",4.6,"500ml bottle @ Bishops Arms, Örebro. Great pour, this is a looker! Deep amber, creamy tobacco stained white head, rich sticky lacing all around the glass. Smoky aroma, leather, oily tobacco, peat, herbs, deep old moisture forest moss, juniper, wet wood, bog myrtle, earthy and mushrooms. Velvety mouthfeel, full bodied, soft carbonation. Taste follows the aroma, this is one of a kind, perfect balance between all the complex flavors. Sweet malty, floral bitter, herbal and the smoke is perfectly lifting the taste and instead of dominating it. Pleasant floral bitter finish. Thanks for this!","Stockholm, SWEDEN","Turtles"

Taste is just peated oil, rosemary, peated hop oil, medicinal, chemical, almost vegetable, extremely weird. Body is hugely oily.

2153,"2017-03-04",3.7,"Small yellowish rim over clear red-copper beer. Intense spicy nose, shoepolish, juniperberry (probably the bog myrtle), and Rauchmalz. Nutty, spicy, cardamom, bit of sovent, spruce, caramel. Very complex, and the smoked malt helping again, without overpowering. Light to medium bodied, very long lasting flavours. Special. Here classified as ""smoked"" (which it is, no doubt), but IMHO, it is the spice, the Myrica Gale, as mentioned on the label, which explains the real complexity.","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
