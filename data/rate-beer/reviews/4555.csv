4555,"2011-02-23",3.5,"Sampled on tap at the brewpub (Minneapolis, MN). Pours a nice golden straw hue, faint haze, a small frothy brightish white head laces small, dies to a ring. Aromas are touches of grassy hops, soap, and grainy bready malts with grass. Initial is a bit sweet up front, bready and grainy malts. Touches of stinky yeasty pils malts, decent grassy and floral hops, bread, crackers, pale malts. Fairly clean, but the bitterness lingers on with a nice yeasty spice that dries out the palate. Not bad. Clean and bitter, lingering sweetness, fresh and spicy yeast do its job. A Pils with some life, fairly fresh, I could put back a few of these","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

4555,"2010-12-13",3.9,"Draft at Town Hall.  Filtered greenish yellow.  Steady white head.  Peppery hop aroma on top of a clean malt backbone.  Reclaiming all the good parts of a Pils .  Pretty big and bold, somewhere between a Bohemian Pils and an Imperial Pils.  Not at all sticky or sugary.  Impressive.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
4555,"2010-07-27",3.5,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2017 Original rating, 7-27-10: 16 oz. pour, on tap at the brewpub. Consumed on 7-26-10. Pours a clear, pale gold with a small to moderate amount of thick, off-white / eggshell head. Very Czech smell; spicy. Very dry, hoppy taste. Definitely a hops-forward pilsner atop a fruity malt background. Long, dry aftertaste. Sharp and lively in the palate. The limitations of the pilsner style make it difficult for an example to be spectacular, in my opinion, but it can be quite solid when done well, and Town Hall Saaz Pilsner is quite solid, having been done well. 7/3/7/4/14=>3.5. Re-rate, 3-28-10: 5 oz. pour, on tap at the brewpub in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Clear, pale brass. Small amount of beige head. Nice color. Weak aroma of apple. I love Saaz, but dont get enough of it in the smell. Floral, honey smell improves upon return. Pleasant, dry, hoppy flavor. Nice, dusty, chalky, bitter finish. This is how a pilsner should taste. Not overwhelming flavor but whats there is quite likable. Saaz is unmistakable in the taste. Lively and crisp in the palate. Medium body, surprisingly heavy for the ABV. East to drink and refreshing. Substantial and very good palate effects. An above average Czech pilsner. Authentic. 7/3/8/4/14=>3.6. Combined score: 7/3/7/4/14=>3.5.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"

4555,"2009-12-30",3.1,"Pours golden, with a nice lasting white head.  Aroma is grassy hops with a bit of lemon, and the taste is similar with a nice grassy hop style pilsner that rounds out with bready malt at the end.  A good pilsner.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
