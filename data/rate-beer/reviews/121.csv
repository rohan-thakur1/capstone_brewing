>> Pours a flat, crystal clear gold with weak legs. Nose is fresh apple, leaf, and earth. Dig deeper and it is fresh apple pie, farmhouse kitchen, hints of alcohol, iced cinnamon roll. In taste, it is off the bat a tad less viscous and slightly more acidic than its Quebecois cousins. But all the things that make ice cider amazing are here: crystalline sugar crunchy apple pie at the front of the tongue and a huge amount of green and yellow baked apple acidity in the back. Long, sour finish. Delicate but easy to love. Tannic apple skin and some wooliness come into play and add a third balancing acid to the mix: sweet, sour, and tannic/bitter. Perhaps a touch too wooly for me. Could easily be chugged if you were a multimillionaire and could stock your cellar with replacements.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
