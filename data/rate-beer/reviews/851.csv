851,"2016-10-26",3.2,"Bottle. It pours a clear, rich orange gold color with a nice foamy off white head. The aroma has spicy and earthy hops. Hints of sulfur and lightly toasted grainy malt. A little soap and minerals. The flavor is noticeably big and thick for the style. A little honey, bread, toast and grains with background notes of spicy hops. Not quite crisp enough even for an Imperial Pils.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
851,"2016-04-17",3.5,"Bomber. Caramel malt aroma with notes of citrus and piney hops. Pours golden yellow with a large off white head with excellent retention and some wispy lace. Starts with good caramel and toffee malt sweetness with a bit of a hop backbone. Finishes dry with citrus hops as well as bitter piney hops as well. Pretty nice imperial pils, though a bit heavy on the ABV.","","zoucrew102"
851,"2016-04-04",3.6,"Bottle.

A: Beautiful caramel color with a swathe of bubbles cutting through the body. Huge foamy white head.

N: Toffee, pine, coriander, earth, leafiness. Very floral with some underpinning minerality. Quite fruity, as well, with pineapple and grapefruit making their presence known.

T: Big sweet malt and corresponding big bitterness.

M: Medium body, very boozy, prickly carbonation. 

O: This is a potent Imperial Pils. Theres a lot going on here, while, at the same time, theres also a ton of alcohol detracting from the experience.","Portland, Oregon, USA","Sarlacc83"

851,"2016-03-30",3.6,"Draft tonight at GG Meridian, polished golden with a rocky white head... This is more of a Czech pils than the other with had a more American lean... Spicy hops with a nice clean graininess... Very drinkable, but the body seems a touch thick... Pretty proper throughout.","Boise, Idaho, USA","JohnGalt1"
851,"2016-03-05",3.2,"Kind of a basic pilsner, better than macro, caramel and wheat notes more strong, more bitter than most pilsner.","Portland, Oregon, USA","stchloe"

851,"2016-02-07",3.3,"Bottle from Albertsons. Clear, medium golden body with nice fluffy head. Grainy aroma, bread, slightly musty. Taste brings in the hops, evening out the malts, nice mild bite at finish. A pils with a little extra...","Boise, Idaho, USA","stevoj"

851,"2016-01-22",3.6,"12 oz bottle from a six pack bought from Trader Joe in Salem OR.
$8.79 (6).
Golden coloured beer..clear with a lovely thick and frothy eggshell white head.
Aroma is fresh caramel malts and a nice spicy hop in the back.
Extremely balanced tasty chewy caramel malts and a touch of hop finishes it off
Excellent mouth feel for style smooth and well carbonated sweet but dry in the end.
A very nice lager beer ..this seems like a slightly hoppy marzen to me.","Salem, Oregon, USA","Reid"
