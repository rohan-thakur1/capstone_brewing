Wow, these guys are just nailing the traditional styles. First, an amber that I actually enjoy, and now a mild thats actually interesting even though its got an ABV that you could feed to a kid. (Well, almost. If it were at the end of hectic day, maybe, and you just wanted a few minutes peace and quiet) Despite the fairly forbidding colour, this thing is mild and approachable, and I hesitate to even call the body medium. Gotta be one of the best milds Ive ever had. (15/20)","CANADA","UXO"

How: Bottle 500ml, purchased directly at the brewery and consumed fresh less than two weeks later.
The look: Clear very dark ruby body topped by a short-lived beige head
In long: Nose is slightly roasted with dark fruits and hints of black liquorice.  Taste is more of the same except with the dark fruits more upfront.  Ive had many 6% beers with a thinner more watery body than this beer, never would I have guessed I was drinking a 3.5% beer.  The beer actually feels sweet but not sugary/residual sweetness, I had the impression that a lot of fresh fruits were crammed in that bottle and I was getting natural fruit sweetness.  The body was so damn full that I was getting sticky black liquorice and even a little tar sensation.  Interesting and totally appropriate hopping with a tobacco-like signature provide an almost perfect balance.  Ive pub-crawled London England searching for a Mild Ale like this one without success.

The aroma is not strong but is pleasant with nutty and chocolatey tones to it.

Flavour and drinkability are this milds real strong point and why I enjoy it so much. It resembles almost a guiness in its delightful abundance of flavours that are present enough to make every sip enjoyable and yet light enough that you could almost wash the whole pint down in one shot if you wanted to. 

I would call it dangerously drinkable and tasty, but at 3.5 ABV you can actually enjoy a lot of these without regreting it too much.","CANADA","Geothermal"
3526,"2008-02-03",3.0,"Tap - Beer Bistro; Copper Brown body with a slight head, hmmm, fairly malt-toffee aroma; similar taste although with slightly plum finish, nothing special although in saying that, kudos for an Ontario brewer","Dublin, IRELAND","garthicus"
3526,"2008-01-15",4.0,"Sampled fresh from a growler purchased at the Brewery on 15/01/08. Deep mahogany body sits under a billowing froth of beige foam. Excellent head retention and minute lacing throughout the drinking experience. The aroma is initially roasted barley and burnt  malts. It is also quite toasty and nutty. Just a touch of vanilla extract and mineral. The flavour profile is surprisingly well rounded and full, but that just goes to show you that full flavoured beers dont have to be high in alcohol. This beer is quite full of sweet burnt malts, toasty barley, quite nutty, with a just enough of a hop presence to create a perfect balance. The finish is dry and lingering. Well done Grand River Brewing!","Hamilton, Ontario, CANADA","MrManning"
3526,"2007-11-21",3.8,"Draught. Copper dark mahogany body with a medium off-white creamy head.
Aroma is pretty solid - nutty creamy almond, some lingering toast and caramel...maybe vanilla too?
Flavour holds its own. Quite nice for 3.5% - nice malts, caramel, toast grain, and nuts. Ive enjoyed this numerous times!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mds"
3526,"2007-11-19",3.8,"Shared growler from brewery, served cold in a Stella chalice. NOV17/07.
App.:  Cola brown, rocky light tan head, clear.
  
Aroma:  Green vegetal herbs, background of dark malts, milk chocolate and nuts, some light coffee.
  
Palate:  Medium body, medium-full carbonation, slightly effervescent.
  
Flav.:  Malts come on first, earthy, herbal hops, sorta vinous, a touch nutty and a hint of cherries; off-dry with just a touch of bitterness and a little light coffee to finish.

Brilliant.","Nepean, Ontario, CANADA","probstblueribbon"
3526,"2007-11-17",4.1,"Sampled at cask days at Volo café.

Cola brown with a bit of red thrown in for good measure, it sported a nice frothy ring.

Roasted, caramel sweetness intertwined to give it an aroma similar to hoisin sauce. It absolutely floored me.

Light as a feather, totally dangerous to drink, the flavors are concentrated in the finish where a mild sweetness, similar to maple sap caress your taste buds and only the faintest kiss of hops pulls it all together. 

This is a good a reason to advocate for milds on cask as I have ever seen.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"
3526,"2007-11-15",3.9,"On tap at the Victory Cafe - came a clear dark chestnut shade with a small off-white head.  Very nice aroma of dark fruits and surprisingly a good amount of hops as well.  Flavour is a beautiful bouquet of currants, raisins, date, plum, fig and a nice good hop punch as well.  To get all this aroma and flavour into a beer this light is a masterful example of the brewing craft, and something rarely seen in these parts.  Bravo.  Grand River is a true gem of the Ontario craft scene.","Parkdale, Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","VeloVampire"
3526,"2007-11-03",3.6,"Brown in colour, small bubbly beige coloured head, no lacing.  The aroma is quite toasty, a surprising amount of malt, light toffee sweetness, some light chocolate.  The flavour is again quite toasty, mildly sweet, some fruit and light chocolate.  Very mild mouthfeel, light body, light carbonation.  Finishes quite mild, lightly sweet, lingering.  An excellent session ale for sure, this packs more flavour then some of the ""big"" beers out there.

Similar flavours as the aroma, but a bit less intense. Chocolate malt, muted nutty notes, very light bitterness throughout is just enough to provide a quaffable balance.

2008-04-20. A blend of the Mild and Plowmans prepared for Volos 20th Anniversary. Dark brown body with a nicely creamy fingers worth of beige head and impressive lacing on the glass. A beautiful pour for a cask! Hoppy green aroma is rather nice. (7+) Flavour has a pleasant light bitterness over a base that reflects the Milds contribution with light roasty malt notes. Smooth average plus palate. (3+) Pretty solid, and rather interesting but while the contrasts in the flavour add interest, they make me think Id prefer to have the base beers on their own.

Aroma is subtle at first, but after I let it warm up a bit, it really opened up - roasted malt, toasted nuts, a but of coffee. Soft mouthfeel. Flavour is very elegant and well-crafted, almost like a mild porter, with notes of roasted malt, coffee, chocolate, and dark fruit.

Flavour follows the aroma but is a little more subtle and has a very abrupt finish.  Still very tasty and incredibly easy to drink. Medium bodied.

 on the Milds! I cant wait to have many more pints of this!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","blankboy"
3526,"2007-08-12",4.0,"GROWLER.  
APPEARANCE:  Very nice Mahogany colour with a mocha head which is big and fizzy and very quick to disappear.
AROMA:  Very nice malt complexity but not overdriving.  Well received aromas of roast, mild chocolate and a touch of caramel sweetness and fruitiness.  The hop aroma was layed up in the back ground.  Just perfect for this style.
FLAVOR:  Wow!  Malt complexity is deep here.  There is a bit of everything that should be present in this style.  Mild chocolate, roast, caramel, fruitiness a touch of plumb.  Hop bitterness is low but balances beautifully with the malt characters.  
MOUTHFEEL:  Medium body with a slight astringency from the roast malt the drys this brew to a lovely closing.
OVERALL PERSONAL COMMENT:
This is a perfect example of and English Mild.  The only think I did not like about this beer was how quick the head disappeared.  This is definitly the best brew I have tasted from this brewery (out of the original four releases).  This beer has its direction.  Good work to the brewer.  I will be back for another.","Preston, Ontario, CANADA","BERNHARDT"
3526,"2007-08-12",3.8,"Several pints, Volo.  Dark brown, big white head.  I was surprised how dark this was.  Really nice aroma - lots of nuttiness and roast - very very nice.  Taste - wow, that is a heck of a lot of flavour for 3.5%!  Im not ignorant to the possibilities of a great mild, I lived in England for a bit and had some nice ones pre-ratebeer, but man, this one is right up there with the greats, so full of flavour - lots of nuttiness and roast again.  Nice roasty sweetness, mild hops in finish.  My only small complaint is that it finishes way too quickly - it really does just stop. But wow, what a great unique accomplishment for the Ontario market.  These guys really should be commended - this makes a perfect #1800 b/c it is a great Ontario brew by a brewery not afraid to take chances - kudos for breaking out of the too easy Ontario me too conservative slump.  And I also chose it for #1800 because it really does indicate where I am at a few years into ratebeer.  I started with Guinness and worked my way up to enjoying just about every style out there.  I love extreme beers but I also love session pints like this - it doesnt have to be one or the other which is something I wish some people would get straight.  Hopheads might complain this is too boring while session freaks rally against extreme hop beers like Ian Paisley screaming about  Catholics on July 12th.  Settle down guys, beers like these can happily co exist. Anyway, end essay, great beer.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
3526,"2007-08-11",3.0,"Pored from a fresh growler, we get a decent clear mahogany colored ale with a tight tan cap that lasts well enough.

Light toast and some roasted husk ""char"" in the nose, light hay-like hop tones.

Medium body, rocky, sharp mouth feel malty character with a mild astringency. Hard watter gives the hops more of a sharp edged ""bite"" than is common in most milds.

Malty-toasty in the front side then the bittering hops kick in and compliment the roasted barley char astringence leaving mild lightly dry, roasted finish....light metallic after taste.

Fairly true to style for a mild although I would like to see some fruity esters from better ale yeast in this brew, even though it is not necessary for style adhesion....which is a ""mild ale"" not ""traditional"".

Drinkable and clean...but just too much like the so so dark milds from F&M which I have never been partial to  Sorry to break up the love in but I was not overly impressed with this effort.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"
3526,"2007-08-08",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 6, 2011 1.9L growler straight from the brewery. Pours a dark red colour, with a huge head. The aroma is very nice, hoppy, almost like a pale ale, but with some decent malts in there too. The taste is hoppy upfront, then it eases off a bit with some sweet malts (very toffee like, almost a bit of coffee too), which eventually fade to a mildly bitter hoppy after taste. Its like a milder version of the Plowmans Ale, but dont think that that simple fact makes this beer any less drinkable and worth paying for. This has to be one of the most flavourful 3.5% beers available.","Margaritaville, Ontario, CANADA","JesseM"
