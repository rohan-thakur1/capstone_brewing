The taste has a nice mix of light dark roasted malts and caramel malts to go along with snippets of thin vague hoppiness, a dash of sweet dark fruity esters and then a mineral to earthy note joins in on toward the finish.

They got to go to the Andechs Monastery, but this was the next best thing for those of us that didnt go to Germany. The bottle had a May 2012 freshness date. Gorgeous brown in the glass with a nice tan foamy head. Light carbonation. A hint of sweet biscuity malt with a hint of caramel in the nose. Initial taste was incredibly smooth, balanced, a touch sweet (but definitely in balance), with a very subtle roast malt flavor--the classic ""Dunkel"" taste. What I didnt taste were any of the off flavors that sometimes accompany older, imported Germans (not referring to myself there). I see why they raved about the drinkability of the local beers on tap in country. They are incredibly fresh tasting and go down oh so easily. Looking forward to the other bottles in the selection.

Medium mouthfeel: solid amounts of caramel, light brown sugar notes, and that persistent smoked meat note appearing in the background; a touch of a metallic presence, but that quickly dissipates; a refreshing, lively, fully attenuated dunkel: this puts so many American renditions to shame; excellent, just not as dense or as savory as their doppelbock.

Bottle brown, 500 ml
Appearance: Pours reddish - brown, carbonation is mild to medium initially, body is perfectly clear, head is off - white, frothy, cappuccino like, initially medium, slowly decreasing to small, leaving good lacing. Very impressive and good looking beer.
Aroma: Aroma is strickingly similar to the previously tasted ’Andechser Dunkles Weissbier’ but deprived of wheat and banana accents. Instead of it the beer contains more roasted barley grains, easy noticable Munich malt, cappuccino accents, slight caramelly, the Dunkel - like aroma is nice, intensive and strickingly similar to previously tasted Bohemian Dunkels, gentle hoppy nose defining and rounding tha taste of flowery kind.
Flavour: Nice, focused, roasty, bitter and dry, slightly creamy, cappuccino, roasted barley grains, no hints of additional sugar like in one popular Polish Dunkel, some bitter touch of hops with herbal to flowery gentle hoppy aroma. Finish duration is long, even some smoky touch.
Palate: Body is medium, texture is rather dry, carbonation on palate is medium, finish feel is chalky.","Zawiercie/Sosnowiec, POLAND","sirPino"

Aroma is delicately composed of french silk pie with chocolate graham crust, stark chocolate toffee, flame licked tree bark, and turtle fudge frozen custard.  Flavor chimes in as lighter fairing.  Cocoa dusted, crushed graham crackers.  Silky chocolate trait folds back the fragile flavor layers.  Liquefied chocolate wafers emit a vibe akin to a touch of room temp hot chocolate, cooled at its warmest state with an ice cube or two and dulled it down by doing so.  Mildly roasted accents with circumstantial caramel drizzles.  Errs on the light side, gently tossing over the tongue with a moments respite at more concrete semi-chocolate characteristics.

1391,"2005-11-10",3.7,"500 ml bottle, bought in Bier Spezi Hamburg. ABV is 4.9%. Typical dunkel clear reddish brown colour, very good and lingering light tan head. Very nice aroma of moderately roasted malts, flaked nuts, caramel and bakery. Flavour is malty and nutty with notes of dark bread and caramel, not too sweet. German dunkels are not ""big"" beers, but are, when well made, a truly enjoyable drinking experience. This is one of them.","Tau, NORWAY","Sigmund"

1391,"2004-09-27",3.6,"Lightly roasty but generally sweet malty aroma with plenty of fruity esters (dates, berries, figs).Beautiful on first pour but head dies quickly. Clear amber-brown with off-white head that diminishes completely. Roasted malts and a fair bitterness are off-set by a surprising fruitiness. Body is quite light and carbonation is rather low. Roastiness and fruitiness both seem out of place in a dunkel to me, though this is quite tasty. Bottle enjoyed with MartinT and Rastacouere.","East York, Ontario, CANADA","tiggmtl"
1391,"2004-09-26",3.7,"Burgundy to orange coloured. Light 1cm off-white head. Tiny bubbles. Quite the truckload of malt in there! The lager light weight fights to offer more flavours than it has and almost succeeds. This is almost smoky, almost spicy, almost fruity. Almost hard to describe actually since unexpected flavours tha shouldnt necessarily be found in a dunkel seem to come up every sip. Blue grapes hints, berries etc.. Malt seems powdery to me on the tongue. Pleasant roastiness, cerealic, flake-like. Fairly long malty finish. Great flavour balance.
