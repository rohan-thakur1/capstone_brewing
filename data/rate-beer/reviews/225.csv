225,"2016-03-31",4.4,"Keg, can, many times, different places

Huge white lacing which is always prominent. Slightly hazy for the style but its a lot more hoppier than a traditional Kolsch. Its also unfilterred. What? Unfiltered Kolsch in London? Yep!

The great thing about this is because its brewed in London and I get it fresh it has no evidence of oxidisation or travelling and so many Kolschs cant stand up to export. There is no sulfur at all. 

Its an incredibly hoppy Kolsch with all the right fruity gentle yeast ester tones I love from Kolsch. I can quaff it back and enjoy. Its a session beer and a certain style which is definitely misunderstood or not valued enough on Rate Beer for me. 

Personally speaking this is exactly what London needs more of. Bravo.","Essex, ENGLAND","tdtm82"
225,"2016-03-31",4.0,"Can at home in London - sourced from Kris Wines. Pours perfectly clear yellow-gold, lightly effervescent, with a creamy, white head. The beer has a pleasant, biscuity aroma, with accents of dough, hay and lemon peel. Light to medium sweet flavour with continuing pale bread, light grain husk, more hay, impressions of citrus, faint bitter grass. Light bodied with average carbonation. Great balance on the finish, with clean biscuits and pale bread, some straw, light grass, lemon rind, hints of tangerine. Incredibly well balanced overall, and immensely drinkable. Im quite impressed by this one.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"

225,"2015-06-01",3.0,"40 Feet Brewery Larger, 4.8%, strohgelb trüb. Aroma nach Zitronenbrause und etwas Kräutern. Kaum wässrig, fest, mittlerer Körper. Antrunk Zitrone mit überlagernden Krautern, harzig. Hopfenbitter. Zur Mitte tritt die Fruchtigkeit zuruck, Bitterkeit bleibt. Im Abgang und Nachhall wieder etwas Zitrone neben deutlicher Hopfenbitterkeit. Gut.

Obwohl von der Brauerei so behauptet hat es wenig bis gar nichts mit einem Kölsch gemein. Eher ein English Pale Ale. 

Not really anything Kolsch-like!","Offenbach, GERMANY","sound67"
