2291,"2014-05-06",3.5,"On tap @ In De Wildeman - Im not sure why this has an entry separate from the ""regular"" Pannepeut. Plus: it was under pressure, so whats the ""real ale"" deal?  Dark brown color, quite clear. No head. Aromas: lots of fruit - sour & sweet, berries - sticky toffeecake, with additionally a little roast and slight bitterness retronasal. Flavor is sweet with a moderate bitter backbone. Medium bodied. Long finish, a bit roasted and lightly bitter. Nice enough.","Amsterdam, NETHERLANDS","PotjeBier"

This one seems to be OK.

2291,"2014-01-27",3.9,"18/I/14 - hand bottled a couple of hours before serving @ RBBWG III, my place - BB: n/a (2014-101) Thanks to Danko for sharing the bottle!
Clear purple brown beer, small aery irregular head, unstable, dissipates rather quickly. Aroma: bubble gum, bit fruity, sweet and sugary impressions. MF: no carbon, medium to full body. Taste: caramel, some chocolate, mocha, little bitter, grains, mocha, bit sweet. Aftertaste: pretty bitter and hoppy, more than I remember from the regular Pannepeut? Some caramel, bit fruity, malty sweetness, more caramel, but a dry ending as well. Did not get to try this version side by side, like I did the other Real Ale versions, but Im pretty sure I liked the regular Pannepeut better as well. So for me that makes 3-0 for originals vs real ales. :p","Gent, BELGIUM","tderoeck"
2291,"2014-01-20",3.6,"Sampler bouteille @ RBBWG III, thanks Danko.
Ambrée, col beige, doré au verre.
Malté gardant cette approche très belge et un profil Struise. Sucré moyen avec cette impression de sous-bois, feuillu. Pointe dépice et fine note de levure.
Une version solide mais un cran en dessous de loriginale. Je pense dailleurs que ce genre de bière se déguste mieux au calme en bouteille et à son aise.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
2291,"2014-01-19",4.4,"25 cl. hand bottle sampled @ RBBWG 2014. Courtesy of & thx! to Danko. Bottled shortly prior to consumption. Copper orange with no head. Nose is sweet & rich with caramel, toffee, brown sugar, cinnamon, sawdust, walnut, faint iron. Taste is sweet caramel, toffee, sweet spices, herbs, brown sugar, walnut, thick malty, touch leaves. Little in the way of carb. easy to drink. Whilst I felt that Black Albert & Cuvée Delphine didnt benefit from the treatment, this one did. Not the biggest one of the regular which is okay but I so much rather think regular Pannepot, this one beats the regular version in my opinion. Pretty solid, could prob. do a pint of this one.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"
