4149,"2016-08-20",3.8,"Bottle courtsy of rlgk. Pours tiny hazy deep red leaving some subtle legs on the glass with a swirl. Smell is heavy fruity with lightly floral honey, intense concentrated fresh strawberries, vanilla beans, moist soil and hints of alcohol. Taste is tiny sweet, slightly sour, fruity and tiny floral. Mouthfeel is soft, round, slightly dry, tiny tart, tiny astringent, tiny boozy and medium bodied. Finish is tiny sweet and tiny sour with light honey, freshly crushed strawberries, moist soil, alcohol and lemon peal. I expected something much sweeter but this is fairly dry. Heavy fresh strawberry character without the weirdness that usually comes with that berry. Drinkable!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"

4149,"2016-07-28",3.9,"June 2016 - Wax top bottle shared at The Watford Non-Beer Tasting, as Mabinogion Mead Hounds of Annwn, collab with Superstition. Very dark cherry red, hazy, opaque, foamy off-white head. Aroma is intense strawberry cheesecake, vanilla, jam tarts. Nice aroma. Body is smooth, oily, soft carbonation. Taste follows aroma and is strawberry cheesecake forward, with some rose wine, pomegranate and some booze showing up. A tasty mead without a doubt, and one of Mabinogions better efforts. I find these too sweet personally, but can see why people like them. (3.9)","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"

Medium bodied with a little carbonation. Drying finish, with further strawberry, relaxed honey sugars, raspberry, mild acidity. Really great stuff. Impressively dry.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Leighton"
4149,"2016-05-05",4.3,"Bottle pours with an amber body that has copper hues and holds up some nice legs. The aroma offers up honey sweetened berry and strawberry with a modest waxy honey comb sensation in there too. The taste delivers berry and strawberry with a modest tartness just as the honey sweetness ratchets up another notch. Behind those flavors is a faint waxy sensation and a slight sweet soft vanilla note. It ends on the dry side in spite of nectar sweet berry and honey going on. Wow, love this.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

4149,"2016-04-30",4.3,"Had this at a mead tasting, and was blown away with the nose, the flavor, and the overall experience. The label is pretty cool, too. I dont know much about this mead, but I want to learn more. I have to thank Dakine for sharing this delicious concoction with me, and I am happy to review it with you here on RateBeer. We tried over 50 new meads last night, and this was one of the best. Cheers!","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","rickyleepotts"
4149,"2016-04-29",3.9,"Bottle. Fresh strawberries from the garden dominate the aroma (reminds me of Straw Berry White) with mellow traces for vanilla beans. Pours dark pinkish copper. The initial sip features earthy strawberry (not as sweet as the nose suggests) with warm vanilla following before a floral and fruity dry finish. Theres a trace of another fruit floating beneath the other flavors, but its subtle enough that I cannot place it. Hints of roasted seeds pop up late. A solid collaboration.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"

4149,"2016-01-29",4.6,"Absolutely beautiful nose, strongly strawberry. Cant believe the colour!
Surprised by how dry it is, while still being quite honey sweet.","Herefordshire, ENGLAND","Tgn"
4149,"2016-01-28",3.7,"14% Version. Lovely, fairly strong strawberries and cream aroma like natural Campino - remember them? Theres a fairly boozy aroma coming out which isnt massively surprising given its strength but the slightly stronger Transformation to Eagle masked the alcohol much better lending to a more delicate overall feeling. The flavours here are more in your face so it is fitting that it be less delicate, although I do find the booziness a little overpowering. However, I expect this may vary from batch to batch. Colour is nice - a brownish red.
Flavour is sweet and fruity at first, leasing to an aged dark woody flavour and finishing with an aftertaste of matured fruit molasses as you might smoke in a shisha pipe but without the saltiness - really good. That alcohol edge could be cleaned up a bit but the flavours are lovely and the bright beginnings becoming more of a deep, darker array of flavours is a welcome journey. A tiny bit thinner than Id deem perfect but leaves a lovely sense of dryness after the initial sweetness which really complements the more complex woody flavours which it ends on. A fantastic creation with wonderful flavours but needs more refining, really just in terms of fermentation it seems to iron out some of that fairly dominant alcohol nose and flavour.","Bristol, Somerset, ENGLAND","leebotton"
4149,"2016-01-24",4.8,"Finally found this in Cardiff. Very experimental.

The nose is very strawberry strong and sweet, while the flavour is dry. The strawberry is strong but you can still taste the honey on your tongue afterwards.

Beautiful dark red in colour, love the label too!","Cardiff, WALES","Lovecrash42"
4149,"2016-01-06",4.7,"Honestly love this. The colour is impressive even when poured. Sits heavily on the tongue and the vanilla shines through the aftertaste. Smooth drinking for certain.","Manchester, ","Daifingua"
