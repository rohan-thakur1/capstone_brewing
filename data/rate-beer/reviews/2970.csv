2970,"2016-08-30",2.6,"1 finger head, leaves spotty lacing... the brew is clear golden.

Nose shows much more ""clean maltiness"" than I was expecting, not the hot malty/creamed corn aspect. some very background hoppiness with warmth.. maybe some grassy hops fit in there somewhere.

Flavor isnt ""exactly"" clean... Some DMS for sure, but not terrible... Clean enough that some EtOH shows as a little hotness and spiciness... Basically just fairly sweet malts with not enough hops to balance... drinkable and sorta approachable for a Craft Beer drinker looking to slum it for a while :-)

Body is pretty thick as expected... carbonation is light making it go down easier.

If given this in a blind tasting, I would guess it a dumbed-down Maibock that didnt quite get the right carbonation.","Boise, Idaho, USA","JohnGalt1"
2970,"2015-09-18",1.6,"Poured into a perfect pint.

3.0 A: Lightly hazed light orange color. One finger of frothy white head. Retention is worse than average and not much in terms of lacing.

3.0 S: Graininess, corn and more corn, and some breadiness. Not digging it. Light earthy hops.

1.5 T: The corn does not mix well with the hop bitterness at all. Perhaps this is why theres never any hops in malt liquor. Grain and breadiness.

3.5 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Light creaminess. Not bad here. 

2.0 D: Ehh, kinda sucks.

2970,"2013-02-05",4.2,"Very happy to have just purchased this beer from Gabriels in San Antonio!  I can already tell you that I am going to get more of this one just in case they run out!

Pours a nice clear tan color with slight orange notes.  Head and lacing werent bad at all.  

Aroma is already FAR beyond any malt liquor youve ever tried.  Its incredibly complex, assuming from the (probably generous amounts of) Hallertau hops.  Its not overpowering like an IPA, rather more delicate and subtle, but wonderful!  I get tons of herbal and grassy notes, a delicate peppery smell, and some fruitiness.  It would be impossible to categorize this as a malt liquor if this were blind and you were just going by aroma (and maybe taste, see next paragraph).

Flavor... again, WOW!  Very nice!  The peppery spiciness is more apparent now, as is the fruitiness.  Although its got some malt-liquor like properties (a little sweet corn, grainy notes, some light alcohol), its more between a strong dry pale ale and a very strong, hoppy lager.  

Body is dry and light, alcohol apparent on the backside, and overall just plain delicious.

Just amazing, great flavor, great aroma, great body, great job Full Sail!

2970,"2012-11-11",3.2,"Location: 22 oz bottle from Half Time, 11/11/12


Aroma: The nose is fairly light, quite malty and yeasty, with some clean hop notes as well

Appearance: This one pours a hazy golden-orange color with a small white head and no lace

Flavor: The taste is much like the nose, heavy malty, a little sweet, and a lightly hop presence

Palate: The body is light-medium, it has a decent feel, average carbonation, and a clean finish

Overall Impression: 
Overall, this one isnt too bad, especially considering the style.  It isnt going to blow anyone away from an awesomeness standpoint, but it is plenty drinkable and completely inoffensive.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
2970,"2012-11-07",2.6,"Bomber bottle from Central Market. A classy malt liquor, say it aint so. Fairly average look: golden color with a thin white head. Thin aroma of light grain, cardboard and sweetness. Flavor: tastes like a malt liquor but  not offensive or harsh...I suppose thats a compliment in this category. Fun beer.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BelgianBeerGal"
2970,"2012-11-07",2.8,"The aroma is corn, rice, adjuncts, booze.  The appearance is clear gold, effervescent, white head.  The flavor is corn sweetness, light noble hops, light booze burn. The finish is sweet, then a boozy, solvent like burn.  Medium in body, greasy mouthfeel.  Not bad.  I did this beer just to boost my ratings of malt liquors, and in that category, this beer is a strong performer.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"

2970,"2012-10-22",3.3,"Bomber from Total Wine in Sacramento, CA. Pours amber gold with a big frothy white head and champagne bubbles. Aroma is heavy malt with some noble/earthy hop. Med body. Frothy carb. Flavor is heavy malt, tends to be a bit heavy on sweet, but theres some earthy/herby hop that tends to cut that way down. It might fairly be described as trying to head towards dry, and there is some bitter. Way better that whats in most of those 24 oz cans.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"

2970,"2009-01-06",2.9,"UPDATED: JAN 9, 2009 I am rating this to style which is a true ghetto style malt liquor. Pours rich golden amber with a three finger white head. Some minor lacings. Aroma is cider and malts.
Taste is winey malty and lots of alcohol. Not too bad for a 8% malt. Very smooth for the style. I would suggest to the new brewer that he make a batch for the old school malt lovers at an abv of 5.5%. Then the flavors would be more in the foreground. For the high abv and the style it was really good. Hopheads should avoid at all costs. Drinkability: depends on how much alcohol you can tolerate.

Mostly clean, appropriately syrupy and thick, and overall pretty good for malt liquor, which means its just above drinkable overall.  Malt Liquor rating #10.
