2549,"2017-05-01",2.9,"(Bottle, from Bottl3.5hop, Stockholm) Pale amber colour with frothy, off-white head. Fruity, hoppy nose with notes of citrus, apricots, orange peel and some toast. Fruity, hoppy taste with citrus, mandarin, apricot marmalade, caramel and a balanced citric bitterness in the finish. Thin body, slightly hollow mouthfeel, a touch of sweetness. On the thin side, but fresh and tasty. Quite enjoyable.","Hässelby, SWEDEN","Svesse"
