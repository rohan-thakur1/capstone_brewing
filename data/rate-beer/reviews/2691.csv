2691,"2017-03-06",3.7,"Thanks to Brian for this treat! Liquide très sombre voire presque noir aux reflets roux et bruns. Une belle tête claire et floconneuse se forme lors du service et demeure en place un temps appréciable. Dominante du côté Barley Wine dans ce blend bien barriqué et dense. Arômes de malts chocolats, de biscuits chocolatés, de pain grillé, de caramel. Des arômes décadents et habituellement réconfortants qui ici me paraissent étonnamment froids et peu réconfortants. Saveurs très serrées de chocolat noir. Texture plutôt sèche qui manque donctuosité et de souplesse. Effervescence adéquate. Beaucoup de malts grillés et de barrique dalcool aux notes épicées. À la longue, un goût ferreux et métallique sinstalle à larrière de ma langue et me gêne. Possiblement que le blend 2 me conviendra davantage. À suivre très prochainement...","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"
2691,"2017-01-03",4.3,"A decadent blend of barrels, roasted malts, vanilla, oak and chocolate with s some light coffee notes for good measure. Dark brown pour, strong aroma and flavor. Smoother than blend 2.","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
2691,"2016-12-26",4.0,"500ml bottle from Healthy Spirits. Black and thick with a lasting tan head. Aroma is bourbon, toffee, dark berries, molasses, chocolate. Flavor is mildly sweet, nice bourbon, slightly bitter finish. Feel is fairly hot, but smooth, light carbonation. Good, in the same vein as Bourbon County, even reminiscent of 50/50 Eclipse.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
2691,"2016-09-24",4.0,"Glass: AleSmith Barrel-Aged Reserve snifter glass 
From: Saint Archer Brewing Company in San Diego, Calif.
Price: $12.99
Purchased: April 24, 2016
Consumed: Sept. 23, 2016
Reviewed as: American Strong Ale
Misc.: Black waxed on neck of bottle; Bottled in Jan. 2016 (educated guess)

Had this at their brewery on tap back in April and picked up a bottle. Wrote on Untappd then that it was, Hot and boozy. If it was bottled in January like I think it was, this should be close to being ready considering I age my stuff in a cabinet and not a cellar. Heres to hopefully a good one.

Poured an almost pitch black color with two fingers of frothy tan head. Very good lacing. Very good retention. (Sight - 4.00)

Smelled bourbon, chocolate, toffee and dark fruit, initially coming in hot, but mellowing out as it went down. Also milk chocolate, oaky notes, vanilla, cocoa nibs, hazelnut, roasty malts and some dark mocha notes. Reminding me slightly of AleSmiths Reforged, but maybe a tad darker. (Smell - 4.50)

Taste wasnt quite as good as the smell. Some more time on this would do wonders. Much darker than I would have thought, getting dark milk chocolate, hazelnut, boozy bourbon, dark cocoa nibs, dark fruits (plum?), oaky notes, vanilla, char wood, roasted toffee, a touch of dark tobacco and chocolate syrup. 12.5 pct. ABV is well hidden. (Taste - 4.00)

Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, warming finish. (Feel - 4.50)

Really liked this. Wouldve liked it more if I would have waited a few more months. (Overall - 4.25)

2691,"2016-03-25",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 25, 2017 From SF: once again first European to rate this-what a honour!
Pours black color, clear, with unstable light brown foamy head. Visually low carbonation. Aroma: prevails note of barley wine, supported with gentle note of imperial stout roadted and dark malts, bourbon barrel, oak, vanilla and dark fruits.
Flavor is practically the same: intense note of barley wine, then steps forward coffee note of porter and gentle roastiness of imperial stout. Bourbon alcohol warmth is gentle noticeable particullary in finish, but not in disturbing way..
Finish is sticky dry. Body is full, texture soft, carbonation is medium. Wow! They crank out damn good beer. My only regret is not getting one more bottle for aging!

This beer have practically nothing in common with american strong ale style, deScripted in BJCP:  for sure it would be more proper to categorize it as a Specialty wood-aged beer.","Bled/SF, ","klm1"
2691,"2016-03-19",3.6,"On tap @ Three Sheets. Very dark brown in color with a khaki head. The bourbon and barrel really dominate here. Its a little hot and boozy for my tastes, but it does have nice chocolate, vanilla, and coconut notes here. Some fruity date and black cherry, too. Quite sweet and sugary, particularly on the tongue. Theres a ton of caramel, brown sugar, and chocolate syrup. A little much, but some nice things here.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2691,"2016-03-03",4.2,"Aromas of massive barrel, chocolate, oak, ash, campfire, tobacco, dark fruits, dark malts, black licorice, charred dark malts and pecans. Pours dark as night with enormous lacing and almost no foam whatsoever. Taste is immense with complexity. Notes of barrel, wood, bourbon, chocolate, oak and burnt malt/wood come through first. Then, the beer delves into a plethora of different directions. Notes of cacao, chocolate, slick caramel, toffee, black licorice, thick chocolate, tree bark, dark chocolate, earth, dirt, fudge, and plenty of dark fruits dance around the palate. Finishes with intense earth and bourbon, oak, maple and leather from bourbon barrels. Alcohol is non existent on the palate. A+","Los Angeles, CA, California, USA","Thisis12ptfont"
