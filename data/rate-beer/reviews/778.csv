778,"2016-10-09",3.8,"Tap at Waseda Oktoberfest. Pours dark brown, nice foamy head. Aroma has some brown sugar, bit of yeast and very slight roast. Taste is sweetish, has some toffee and some weird fruity or gummy feel that I cannot really place but which feels pretty good. Some slight roast and burnt caramel with nuts. Aftertaste is surprisingly dry and with slight bitter feel. Pretty good, not too sour and has a good balance.","ESTONIA","jinroh"
778,"2016-05-14",3.6,"On tap at　Kyoto jibiiru 2016. Subtle banana notes, milk chocolate. Held its head high, and was delightfully creamy in the mouth. Good stuff.","Kyoto, JAPAN","Westkyoto77"
778,"2015-12-27",3.6,"A creamy,chocolaty,fruity,dunkelweizen. Definitely not your standard dunkelweizen and would probably only buy this again when I wanted something different from the ordinary.
Not bad.","JAPAN","left_bank"

778,"2014-05-04",3.4,"THe spritz and life of the classic weizen is replaced with a smokey, ashy, toffee and chocolate body. Fine, but I will do either their weizen or rauch dependant on mood, rather than this near amalgamation.","JAPAN","jonno"
778,"2014-04-24",3.6,"Bottle from Yamaoka. Pours almost black with ig off-white head. Aroma has burnt chocolate and banana. Chocolate flavour almost overpowers the weizen flavours but still very tasty.","Kyoto, JAPAN","GenkiGonzo"
778,"2014-04-11",3.4,"Bottle from Asahiya. Big round banana nose with some spicy fruitiness, light chocolate, and yeast. Cloudy dark brown, thick dark tan head. Smooth cocoa, light tangy prune, cake, biscuits. Medium body. Mild overall. Light flavors. The yeast is a bit much.","Hirakata, JAPAN","maekchu"
778,"2014-03-28",3.9,"Bottle from Asahiya. After trying a smoked weizen yesterday I figured Id give the Fujizakura schwartz weizen a try. Served in a weizen glass. A great dark brown almost black pour with a big head of beige foam & nice lacing. A good aroma of clove weizen spiciness with an underlying smooth chocolate. Medium bodied with a silky mouthfeel. The taste gives you the weizen one minute then roast chocolate the next. I think I could even imagine some notes of a banana dipped in chocolate! But in a totally good way, this is genre bending stuff. I really liked it.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KansaiBeerLvrs"
778,"2014-03-25",3.8,"Tap at Gar Eden. Very subtle. Milky choc overwhelms the weizen aspect. Aroma has some banana, and some in the taste, but choc sweetness dominates.","Tokyo, JAPAN","shoulderbroken"
778,"2014-03-22",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 6, 2014 Quite a creamy body, gentle flavor mix of milk chocolate and banana cake, clean finish. A smooth dunkelweizen without being outstanding, does have the usual Fujizakura clean and elegant character.","","biirusaikou"
778,"2014-03-20",3.6,"Tap at Molto. Quite black, very cloudy, with a tall head. Interesting if not lovely. Nose is typical sweet, creamy weizen with cocoa added. Banana and clove, rich wheat, apple, just a bit roasted. Full, creamy body. Well done, though still not as good as their light weizens.","Kyoto, JAPAN","KyotoLefty"
778,"2014-02-28",3.7,"Aroma: banana, pear, floral, wheat and milk chocolate
Flavor: apple/pear blend, milk chocolate, some banana appears after it warms a bit, coffee note, straw.
Comment: turns dry on the mid-palate and finishes dry. Lighter body with good flavor intensity.","Kobe, JAPAN","Wombata"
