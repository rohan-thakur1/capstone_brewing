   Aroma is malt and chocolate, auburn, tiny toffee head. Flavour is a beautiful coupling of malt and hops, achieving a fine chocolate happening. Light bodied, very well balanced, bitterness is something to behold. A meal in a glass, which is light yet satisfying. Great Session!","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DougShoemaker"

3494,"2010-05-15",4.3,"Cask conditioned at The Grapes, Oxford. Black with tan head, ruby hue. This could well be the best lower ABV mild I have had. Beautifully balanced between a rich fruity malt with a summer fruit character and a good level of hop for a little bite. Wow was all we could say when we first set into our pints. Im so glad I had this in great condition, fantastic stuff Otter.","Banbury, Oxfordshire, ENGLAND","imdownthepub"

A very nice looking beer, clear and a rich mahogany-brown shade. It has a thin white head which quickly disappears. Mild bitterness with undercurrents of sweetness. Clean on the palate.","Norfolk, ENGLAND","dynamiteninja"
3494,"2010-04-23",4.0,"A Mes rate. Cask at Baker Street Sporks.Dark mahogany but more brown than black and a very good off white head and lace. Plenty of condition in it. This is a bloody excellent mild. Light and fruity on the nose. Really good in the mouth. Hints of coffee and chocolate, roasty and toasty but its all just... erm... mild. Faint tartness and mineral notes that remind me of Harveys Sussex and thats nothing to complain about at all. Good earthy malt finish with something slightly herbal in it too. This is a little peach if you ask me. Throughly accessible, effotlessly drinkable and does everything it should do. Took me all of five minutes to down it. I didnt mean to, I just suddenly realised it was gone. Excellent stuff.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

3494,"2010-04-18",3.8,"Cask handpull at Westgate, JDW, Mass Spoon Rating.  Very dark brown with a thin dark beige head.  Ok, that is a good mild.  Very good dark malts, not overly roasty, more of a dark fruity mild.  Lovely roasty aroma, then some really good berry fruits in the mouth and then a juicy fruity finish.  Man this is good.  Shows you dont have to go extreme to make a really good beer.  Loved it.  The juiciness is outstanding.  Black cherry mostly.  Bit of blackberry.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
