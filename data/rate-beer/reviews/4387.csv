4387,"2016-05-12",3.0,"On tap at Burleigh Brewing, pours black with a reddish hue and a small tan head. Aroma brings out notes of coffee and dark dried fruits. Flavour is along the same lines, with dried fruits, like figs and dates, and moderate coffee notes. Medium roastiness and dark fruitiness. Decent.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
4387,"2015-10-10",2.4,"650ml bottle into pint glass. Coffee/chocolate nose, a little fruity sourness. Black beer with foamy white head. Medium body, light mouthfeel, a little zing on the tongue. Finish is all dry coffee notes, quite intense. The problem I have is I dont like the taste of coffee so although I appreciate the process and skill here Im not enjoying it. Just tastes like cold coffee to me.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","TedE"

4387,"2015-08-27",3.6,"I felt this beautiful coffee flavor would be better with a lighter flavored beer as the dark Guinness type of beer isnt something i would normally favor.. but i can taste the coffee though, so it was so unique and different!","Robina, AUSTRALIA","lbruce"
4387,"2015-06-06",3.3,"Tiramisu! Pours black with short lasting tan head. No coffee bouquet. First hit is bitter coffee but before you can react it is followed up by a creamy malty sweetness that balances it off. Creamy, sweet and coffee? Tiramisu!

4387,"2014-06-28",4.1,"(Bottle) Fantastic looking beer - Clear very dark, essentially black, with deep ruby red hints, and a dark thick head. Great aroma - black coffee, tobacco and hints of vanilla. Light body with gentle prickly carbonation. Great taste, but nothing like a lager. The taste is dominated by dark roast flavours which are present from the foretaste but steadily grow until they give a rich dark roast coffee bitter finish. Theres smoky notes throughout, and some gentle tangy fruitiness at the start. Overall a very unusual beer and one that works very well.","Sydney, AUSTRALIA","Pyobon"

4387,"2014-01-05",4.0,"Effervescent and dull black body. Tan head which dissipates leaving a healthy amount of lacing. The lager yeast leaves space for the bitter coffee to shine, which is phenomenal. Big roasted bill and a hint of dark choclate. Pretty thin malt character and a watered down finish.

4387,"2013-09-27",3.5,"650ml bottle.
Pours black with a finger of tan, large bubbled head.
Nose is really lovely, roasted coffee, and not much else. Maybe a hint of sweet malt.
Flavour is very coffee forward. Coffee throughout the palate, but a little bit of floral hops in the mid palate. Finish is slightly sweet with a great combination of fruity hop bitterness and coffee bitterness.
Medium bodied, with a sort of dry, tannic mouthfeel from the coffee. It also left some really zany lacing in my glass, sort of cloudy and murky with little spots of head.
Pretty enjoyable. The actual beer flavour is very clean, and it lets the coffee shine through. However I cant help but wonder whether this would have been better with a slightly more complex base beer.","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","Niksko"
4387,"2013-09-21",3.9,"Coffee-black pour with a yellow-white head. Moderate carbonation. Very strong coffee flavours as expected, however there is no overpowering bitterness that is usually associated with beers that have added coffee. Very light bodied, as it uses lager yeast that makes this beer perfect for the months between summer and winter, as it has qualities suitable for both .","Highton, AUSTRALIA","mattyhennessy"

4387,"2012-10-27",4.1,"A surprisingly good, deliciously meaty lager this one turned out to be. At just on cool a steady pour resulted in a black as black bodied beer lined with very fine carbonation. Tight, tidy and satin sheened tannish pad atop lasts the length. Aroma of Banksia, gum tree bark and smoked red wood, damp soil, oak, cocoa and freshly kilned coffee bean comes thick and fast. The persistent head adds a creaminess to the palate. Heavy smoky edge with a backbone of macchiato-like coffee flavours. At first simplistic but well presented. A touch of vanilla and bitter burnt berries linger long with the smoke. Assertively bitter but in complete balance. This is moorish stuff. Had the saliva glands just peaking; the olfactories working overtime. It is beautifully rounded, thick and full in body and silky smooth in feel. Lasting presence just tops it. I was confused  as style but geez this is good. Lovely!  (65cL, no date stamp, BWS Ellenbrook)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"
4387,"2012-10-24",3.5,"Pours a perfect velvety black with pale chocolate head. Aroma is sensational coffee and very robust. Flavour is a letdown. This should have been fermented with an ale yeast and made into a stout, but unfortunately it was lagered and lost a lot of the flavour that could have been. Still very enjoyable","Brisbane, AUSTRALIA","DeliriumT"
4387,"2012-09-16",3.3,"Pours a solid black with a large but diminishing ten head - hence the name I guess. Coffee and roasted malt are evident on the nose. Taste has more coffee, dark malt and a smoky note, followed by a metallic tang at the end. The body is rather lighter than I expected given the colour. Slightly unbalanced and a bit weird, but not too bad for all that.","Camp Hill, AUSTRALIA","Jado"
