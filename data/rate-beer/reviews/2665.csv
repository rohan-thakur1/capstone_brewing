2665,"2017-06-09",4.3,"750 ml bottle into snifter, bottled on 1/26/2017. Pours lightly hazy/cloudy very dark brown color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy light khaki head with good retention, that reduces to a thin cap that lingers. Light spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation retaining the cap. Aromas of huge caramel, toffee, milk chocolate, cocoa, brown sugar, vanilla, maple, molasses, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, brown bread, and nuttiness; with lighter notes of raisin, plum, fig, cherry, date, and roast/toast/oak earthiness. Lightly increasing booze in the aromas as it warms, but never overwhelming. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of dark/roast/bready malt, bourbon barrels, and light-moderate fruity yeast notes; with great strength. Taste of huge caramel, toffee, milk chocolate, cocoa, brown sugar, vanilla, maple, molasses, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, brown bread, and nuttiness; with lighter notes of raisin, plum, fig, cherry, date, and roast/toast/oak earthiness. Light roast bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness on the finish. Lingering notes of caramel, toffee, milk chocolate, cocoa, brown sugar, vanilla, maple, molasses, bourbon, toasted oak, coconut, brown bread, nuttiness, dark fruit, cherry, and roast/toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, bourbon barrels, and light-moderate fruity yeast flavors; with an awesome roasted bitter/sweet and bourbon/oak spiciness balance; and with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Slight dryness from roast bitterness and bourbon/oak spiciness, lightly increasing through the glass. Light-medium carbonation and fairly full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky, and slightly slick/sticky/chalky/tannic balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Mildly warming alcohol from 16.3%, with minimal barrel booziness. Overall this is an amazing barrel aged blended strong ale! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roast/bready malt, bourbon barrels, and light-moderate fruity yeast flavors; very smooth and dangerously easy to sip on for the huge ABV. More of an old ale on style, but still has nice levels of chocolaty roast presence. Perfect balance of barrels; adding plenty of complexity to the base blend, without being boozy or overly tannic. An insanely enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

The nice aroma was molasses brown malt dark malt and bourbon. The vinous mouth feel was weakly tingly at the start and at the finish with a mellow bourbon aftertaste. The nice flavor contained notes of molasses brown sugar sassafras bourbon brown malt and dark malt. Delicious and one I would certainly like to have again.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"

This was a 2012 vintage. The beer is great, his company, not so much. The pour is a dark brown with some ruby or dark red hues shining through. There is a small tan head roiling down with a little lace. The aroma is pretty fantastic. There is a ton of sweetness right up front, big sugar, molasses, caramel, and a surprising note of vanilla. There is a good chocolate malt and a nice dark fruit in there as well. There is a touch of heat, which is to be expected, but it balances very well. The flavor is much of the same. There is a little bit of sweet candy in here behind the sugar and molasses. The chocolate, vanilla, and caramel really play well together in a makeshift sundae in my mouth. The mouth feel is thick and creamy with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly sweet sugary finish. This one is excellent.

2665,"2016-02-06",4.3,"A 750 ml-es üvegek királya, a The Bruery főzde palackjainak mindegyike magán hordoz egyfajta elit-jelleget, az embernek ugyanis rendre olyan érzése támad az elegáns küllemű darabok láttán, hogy a bennük rejlő ital igazi különlegesség hordozója, olyan, melyre érdemes odafigyelni. Nem mondhatnám, hogy a márka főzeteinek legnagyobb ismerője vagyok, az eddigi tapasztalatok azonban megerősíteni látszanak az exkluzív jelleget a Bruery-sörök tekintetében, különösen ha egy díjnyertes elegy hordozója a főszereplő, mely nem akármilyen komponensekből állt elő, s amely alkoholfok tekintetében sem utolsó. Ez az american strong ale nem viccel, amikor intenzív jellegről, kiemelkedő tartalomról, makulátlan szerkezetről esik szó, egyszerűen lenyűgöző karakter tárul elénk a felnyitását követően. Illata marcipános, karamelles és vaníliás, sokszínűsége magával ragadó. A műfaj valamennyi sajátosságát megcsillantja, magán visel minden jegyet, amely egy hasonló kaliberű főzettől elvárható. Az american strong ale afféle iskolapéldája, amely anélkül vonultatja fel gigantikus arzenálját, hogy azok súlya alatt előbb-utóbb repedezni kezdenének az alapok, s fogyasztója számára megterhelővé válna a karakter. Itt ugyanis bár semmi esetre sem hétköznapi italról van szó, nem válik nyomasztóvá a különleges jelleg, a sokadik korty után sem állít kihívás elé a tartalom befogadása. A mondanivaló ugyanis tökéletesen lekerekített és fogyasztóbarát, az igényességre törekvés menthetetlenül kiütközik a szerkezeten. Bár a vanília, a fahordós-tölgyes jelleg, a karamella, a marcipános és likőrös jegyek, a fekete gyümölcsök hangulata nem a visszafogottság megtestesítői egy sör esetében, s ezen intenzív komponensek jelenléte a kezdeti lehengerlő hatást követően hamar átcsaphat csömörbe, a kiegyensúlyozottság foka, a tökéletesen alátámasztott test ez esetben gondoskodik a minőség folyamatos biztosításáról, az érdeklődés lankadatlanságáról, az izgalmak szüntelenségéről. S ahogyan az intenzív jelleg a kortyolása során mindvégig megmarad, olyannyira lapul meg a háttérben az alkoholfok cseppet sem elhanyagolható, mégis észrevétlenül munkálkodó mértéke.","HUNGARY","adster"

2665,"2015-11-15",3.8,"De Grote Black Tuesday Tasting: 13 Versions. For all versions: 750 ml. bottles sampled. 2011 Black Tasting (4.1/5) vs. 2013 Black Tuesday (4.3/5). Neither were gushers unlike the 2012 I tried once before. Both pour very dark brown with some black, virtually no head in both cases. Some lone bubbles with the 2011, nothing at all with the 2013. Alcohol is huge in both cases, a touch lower in the 2011, some light oxidation & varnish notes in the 2011, thick bourbon, mocha, Alcohol is even bigger in the nose with the 2013, harsh & brutal. Raw white spirit almost. More mocha, sweeter chocolates & very thick mocha in the nose in the 2013. 2011 carries some light oxidation in the taste, less raw, big burning alcohol in the finish but overall a bit muted, some weird notes here, leaves, varnish, touch oxidation, making this one the lesser one of the two. You also get hugely thick molasses, harsh bourbon, Body is low carbonation & molasses, pure syrup. Booze is huge, in the 2013, vodka, raw spirit, burns, the taste is niches, thick syrup, more cacao, chocolate, sweet cacao nibs, not getting oxidation here, molasses, chocolate syrup. Same thick molasses. Overall a fun beer due to its extremity but it is also bit of a caricature, too excessive. Overall I am not crazy about it but I do like but it far from all that impressive. Winefication I (4.2/5) + Winefication II (4.4/5) (obtained in a trade with AdamChandler. Thx!) side-by-side. Winefication I pours a very deep red Bordeaux, little bubbles. Nose is quite strange, the two components seem to clash a bit here, molasses, mocha, sweet, umami, big roasted oak, soy sauce with thick dry sweet red wine, odd. Taste is huge oak, massive roast, wine character dominates, this one is a bit hard to describe for me, raisins, huge dry strong boozy red wine with huge church incense taste, dry, red grape skins, touch plastic, fruit punch, Thick & dry. Very much a strong basic red wine with some components that clash a bit, interesting to say the least. Winefication II is hugely different, also massively wine-like but just a different wine. This one is a better wine, less conflict here just a supper thick wine. Pours a very dark red Bordeaux, little bubbles. Nose is light mocha but largely hugely vinous, lots of oak, dry red grapes. Taste is huge oak, lots of roast (very much as was the case with the I), lots of roasted barrel, interesting mix of licorices, wine leaves, wine ranks, red grape, huge dry red frape spins, light plastic, vinous, warming (strangely tasted about as strong as I despite the huge ABV difference),.. Very thick, weird, unique & interesting. Melange #1 (4.5/5).Very dark brown, solid mocha head. Nose is huge red wine, balsamic vinegar, very tart, puckering red fruit, Not getting any Black Tuesday here. Taste is puckering sour red grapes, wine, faint glue, balsamic vinegar, pomegranate, sour cherries, Very thick body & puckering. Lovely. Not getting any Black Tuesday here oddly & like it more than Oude Tart. Quite simple but also very nice. This should be the 3rd batch made. Melange #3 (3.8/5): Very dark brown with a deep red hue and no head. Nose is weird, almost a bit like Black Tuesday (dominates heavily) with something sourish (White Sap I suppose), glue, bourbon, heavy alcohol, glue, oak, lots of bourbon. Taste is weird, faintly sour vanilla, thick bourbon, boozy Black Tuesday, molasses, thick basic licorice, syrup, Thick, boozy. Strange mix. Doesnt fully work for me. Least favorite of the 13. Chocolate Rain 2013 (4.7/5): Very dark brown to black, only some bubbles as is usual. Nose is huge thick sweet mocha, milk chocolate, vanilla, sweet bourbon, thick candy, molasses, thick & sweet. Taste is huge vanilla, bourbon, warming, mocha, vanilla, cacao, sweet chocolate, molasses, thick, sweet. Awesome, this is the 3rd time I have this beer, still surprised by how well it really works. So much better than the base beer. Grey Monday (4.2/5): Black / brown, zero head as usual. Hugely alcoholic nose, syrup, mocha, molasses. Taste is hugely boozy, molasses, thick syrup, very straightforward & basic, mocha, exotic sugar. Very basic, body is alcohol & molasses. Second time I have this beer & I am still not getting the hazelnuts. This one is still a bit pointless for me. 2013 Mocha Wednesday (4.4/5): Black, dark brown with no head. Nose is weird charcoal, ashes, burned wood & hugely roasted espresso beans. Taste & smell carries so much more roast & coffee than I remember this one having. Taste is burned mocha, charred barrels, huge roasted espresso, molasses, charcoal, mocha, sugar & molasses sweetness in the back. Basic but nice, quite an interesting heavily roasted espresso tastes & charred barrels. Thick body as usual. Rum (4/5), Madeira (4.4/5) & Port BA (4.4/5) versions next to each other. First two look as expected, very dark brown, dash black with basically no head. Port one has very dark red hue. Rum is the least one, even less than the base beer. Kind of pointless since the rum is far too muted & doesnt seem to add much, the base beer sort of drowns it out. Nose is sweet booze, mocha, very basic, pretty much Black Tuesday without bourbon, more sugar. Taste is boozy overly syrupy, barrel, big oak, very alcoholic, basic brown sugar, candy, mocha, roast, brown sugar. Okay but less than regular Black Tuesday & clearly lesser than Madeira or Port. Madeira: nose is hugely sweet mocha, sweet sugar, light complimentary barrel, sweet light red wine, faint red fruits. Taste is hugely sweet, spirit, coated in oak, old strong wine, huge brown sugar, vinous alcohol, sugar, oak, molasses. Thick chewy. Works rather well. Better than regular Black Tuesday & prob. my fav. of these 3 (Rum, Madeira & Port). Hard to choose between this one & port. Port: nose is huge red wine, massively so with strong alcohol, candy & lots of barrel. Taste is huge port, red wine, booze, light molasses, plenty of barrel, roast, oak, light chocolate, thick. Quite interesting & nice, also better than the regular one for me. Final one: Black Tuesday Reserve (4.6/5). Usual appearance. Nose is huge bourbon, warming, toffee, molasses, bourbon, boozy but oddly less so than the regular one, this is one is much rounder, chocolate, caramel, fruity even. Taste is vanilla, huge mocha, chocolate, overripe fruit, molasses, cereal, sugar, warming, syrupy, finish is heavily booze but the booze is in the back here as opposed to everywhere in the regular, barrel, oak, cacao, mocha. So much rounder, richer. Way better than expected, nice surprise, very big beer.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

I can only imagine it made this incredible beer even more enjoyable. Pours a dark muddy brown color with a thin ring head. What a fun blend this is. Heavy raisin, toffee, oak, and spice aroma. Flavor has some vanilla, wood, toffee, and chocolate. So much going on here. Very complex, which is no surprise, considering its a blend of three beers that are plenty complex on there own. Has a bit of a lingering bourbon finish. Slightly cool, and boozy, though not off putting. I cant say that I absolutely love the flavor entirely, I am easily able to admire it.

Pours a deep burnished brown with faint ruby at the edges and a smallish tightly bubbled khaki head that slowly dissipates to a ring on top. The smell of bourbon and oak hit my nostrils as soon as I pop the cap off the top. Upon closer inspection I am greeted with light and brown sugars with a fair amount of dark pitted fruit and a hint of ethanol. the flavor is sweet up front with brown and syrupy sugar. Dark and light fruit come next along with a bit of vanilla and wood. The alcohol and bourbon come in next with a ferocity that wont quit. Long lingering tannic wood and alcohol burn long after the sweet liquid settles to the bottom floor. Medium to thick body with a light to moderate level of carbonation and a sweet harsh alcoholic mouthfeel. Nice sipper, but there is no denying the alcohol content of this one. This is tasty but it needs some time to settle down.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"

Broke this out of the cellar despite not drinking in January. The wax was a pain in the ass to remove as if Bruery didnt want me to try this delicious amazing beer.

Poured a minimal head that faded fast. Amber to brown hues, very clear. 

Nose is very much big vanilla and wheat wine sweetness. Lots of caramel / toffee on the nose.

Taste..wow. VERY sweet, very apparent bourbon booziness but not in a hot boozy alcohol well. just the taste with none of the boozy characters like burn that youd get from a 15%+ beer. Loads of caramel, oak and heavy bittersweet chocolate. Some figs and finish is vanilla bourbon.

The beer appears walnut brown with subtle burgundy highlights. Small off white head that leaves minimal lacing on the goblet.

Smell is phenomenal. Oak, vanilla, bourbon, malt, sugar cookies...wow...yes, please. 

Flavor = silky smooth. Staggering! What just happened?!? I am instantly convinced that I need to fill a portion of my cellar with this delectable concoction. Go Patrick! A vanilla and toffee bomb. Black Tuesday emerges more than the White Oak and Papier. Wonderfully complex and insanely delicious. Beautiful milk and dark chocolates. Likely the best strong ale I have ever had. 

Feel = give me more ASAP. Delicate and smooth. Hard to believe this is 15% abv. Lingering flavors of vanilla, bourbon and toffee.

Shocking. World class. So grateful to try it. My highest recommendation.

The beer pours a medium to dark brown color with some red highlights and a tan head. The aroma is extremely sweet. I get a ton of brown sugar and molasses notes, as well as some wood, maple and vanilla. Unfortunately the flavor is just as sweet as the aroma.

2665,"2012-09-28",4.7,"2011, Batch 2, 15% ABV, 750ml into a tulip glass. Huge thanks to Rempo!

A - Pours a murky dark brown body with a red tinge when held up to the light. Initial pour yields a nice one finger light tan head with large bubbles. Settles down quickly to a thick edging. Decent amount of lacing for this amount of abv. Sticky alcoholic legs that last forever.

S - Big in every way. Molasses, dark caramelized fruit, bitter chocolate, leather, and huge bourbon notes of vanilla and oak. Sweet and spicy with some robust and savory notes. This beer is just all over the place, a complete diabetic complexity. Its smells so damn tasty though. Ive had Cuir, and its very reminiscent of that but with more depth and a touch of stout notes. It does smell primarily like an old ale though.

T - The taste is also massive. Super syrupy malt sweetness. Caramelized dark fruit, molasses, toffee, maple, and smokey leather. Like the nose, this leans toward the anniversary beer more so than the Black Tuesday and White Oak. Bourbon barrel notes of oak and vanilla on the finish along with a huge yet pleasant alcohol burn. I get the slightest hint of chocolate and coffee on the end as well, but its all about the fruit here.

M - Thick, coating, chewy and syrupy. Medium level of carbonation. Huge booze warmth, but the thickness is really what holds back the drinkability. 15% is very well integrated though.

O - A huge beer of massive complexity. Ive only had Cuir on its own and I do detect a lot of those flavors. I was hoping for some more action from the Back Tuesday or the White Oak Sap. Its still an amazing beer and accomplishment though. The Bruery can work wonders with insanely high gravity thick brews. It lived up to my expectations for sure.","Connecticut, USA","davey101"

4.0 A: Black color in the glass, but it didnt look so dark during the pour. Oh well. Two fingers of beige frothy head. Retention is very good given the ABV, but nothing is left with regard to lacing.

4.5 S: Intensely sweet with huge dollops of caramel, toffee, and molasses. Lots of oak and vanilla in this. Leathery bourbon booziness. Fair amount of chocolate and dark fruits with emphasis on prune and fig. The aromas from the base beers blend quite well together. 

3.5 T: Again, intensely sweet. The decision to drink this alone was a bad one, but I will persist. Anyway, this reminds me a lot of straight up Black Tuesday in that the sweetness goes unchecked and the booze is almost as bad. However, both the sweetness and booze are a little lower in magnitude. Anyway, a lot of caramel, toffee, molasses again. Chocolate, fig, plum, prune, melon, vanilla, and oak. Leathery bourbon, brown sugar, butterscotch. Huge all around.

4.0 M: Syruppy heavy body. Good moderate carbonation. Velvety creaminess. The only problem is the amylase coagulation that is going on.

O - I have always enjoyed this one. It has all the flavors I enjoy and the blend works very well. This one is still a little too boozy, cant wait to drink the others in the future.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

2665,"2012-03-14",3.1,"2011 Release, Sampled March 2012
A soft pour into my small tulip glass produces a fat-two-finger thick, pale brown tinged, dirty tan colored head.  The ber is a concentrated brown / amber color that shows a brilliantly clear, cranberry-ruby hue when held up to the light. The aroma smells quite alcoholic, but has lots of other notes as well, but that is certainly prominent.  Notes of vanillin, toasted coconut, Sherry, lots of nut like notes, toasted caramel, sweet caramelized brown bread. The sherry character is actually quite striking, both the alcohol, the rich, sweet nutty notes and the oxidized malt contribute to this really smelling quite a bit like sherry. This definitely smells like desert in a glass.

As expected, from the nose, this beer is quite sweet; the sweetness seems a touch simplistic / sugary as opposed to really rich, concentrated malt like in character, by which I mean there seems to be a fair amount of residual, simple sugars left in this beer. The body is certainly viscous, but actually somehow seems light for a beer of this strength; much of the, perceived, lightness is likely contributed by the amply noticeable, warming and even hot, alcohol notes that play a prominent role in the flavor. Ample flavors of sweet coconut, vanillin, sugar coated / toasted nuts, sweet sherry, amaretto, and perhaps a touch of brandy like fruit character are noticeable. Woody oak, with a touch of astringency and some spiciness comes into and lingers through the finish; the alcohol also lends to the spiciness and heat in the finish. There is a definite fruitiness here as well, it is sort of evocative of prune juice, perhaps a touch of fig and raisin as well. Other flavors of maple syrup, toasted oak, brown sugar syrup, touches of roasted bitterness in the finish, and a toasted, brown bread note add some character. 

This is definitely a HOT beer, at this alcohol level that is not unexpected, but I cant say that I necessarily appreciate that either. The sweetness is also a bit too simplistic in this beer; I would have been more appreciative if the malt character was less simple sugar focused and had more of a dense, almost savory, concentrated malt character. Interestingly enough, given how hot this beer is, I dont get as much Bourbon character as I was expecting; more of the vanillin, spicy oak, and toasted oak come out individually rather than reminiscent of actual Bourbon. Not a bad beer if you are only having a couple ounces as a nightcap, but anything more for me is just a bit underwhelming (not complex enough in flavor) and overwhelming (in the hot alcohol and sugary sweetness) at the same time. I must say that I really like the oxidized malt character / sherry notes that are on display here (is this the anniversary old ale contribution), it really adds an extra dimension that keeps me much more interested than I otherwise would be. Drinkable and even enjoyable in small amounts if I am not critically evaluating the beer. Before cracking this beer, I had not reallized how strong it was going to be, I wish I had, as I would have planned to use the rest of the beer for cooking of some sort; I could imagine this being used quite well in a rum cake recipe, or even a dense fruit cake would likely be a perfect use (just make sure to reduce the level of sugar called out for in the recipe to account).  I am planning on this already with the bottle of Black Tuesday that I am opening; in fact I am almost more excited about the Imperial chocolate stout cake that I am going to make than actually drinking the beer :-).","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Oaky notes in the nose along with some roast, vanilla, with an odd mix of fruit notes. Not sure on the nose or not and if I like it. The taste to me is heavy on the Black Tuesday, either that of those flavors just dominate the whole thing. The blending works though I am enjoying this. What I would say is that on a day like this, trying so many great beers, this one sort of gets lost in the mix and doesnt stand out for me. Ill have to try it again on its own and re-rate I think.

A: Pours a very deep brown bordering on black with a fairly nice head and whisps of lacing as it goes down.

S: Quite sweet. Amazing how all the different components of the three beers come out. Can absolutely simultaneously sniff out the Black Tuesday, Papier, and White Oak, all of which are great beers in their own right.

T: Sweet, caramel malt alongside dark, roasted chocolate malt and a good dose of bourbon and oak. Surprisingly not hot at all in the flavor department; however, my nose feels the slightest alcohol burn after swallowing.

M: Thick and fairly chewy. Remarkable how little alcohol presence there is for a beer of this strength.

D: Only gets better as it warms up. Delicious all around. Great to savor its complexity throughout and keep discovering new flavors.

A - Pours a dark brown with tan head. Sits black in the glass with a spot or two of lace.

S - The is the best part of the beer. Bourbon, vanilla, caramel, alcohol, a little fig, and oh wait, another heaping of alcohol...

T - Considering this is a blend of three ridiculously big beers and then thrown in a barrel extra long, theres a little too much going on. Way too sweet, caramel, candi sugar, alcohol, molasses, candi sugar, alcohol, vanilla, candi sugar, oak, chocolate, and candi sugar.

M/D - This is a pure dessert beer. Low carbonation, a little thin, and only able to barely sip on.

The Bruery needs to invest in 25mL bottles for these ridiculous offerings they keep putting out. Its like an overpowering whiskey, it needs to be diluted so you can actually enjoy it.

Whoa, the aroma is big and crazy sweet.  Theres a dominant rum-soaked dark fruit sweetness with some toffee and molasses.  The other major aroma is the barrel which imparts a vanilla sweetness and bourbon on top of that.

The taste is more of the same but with a bit more of the bourbon coming out, especially in the finish which leaves an alcohol burn after each sip.  Of course, the sugary malts, dark fruits, chocolate and tobacco underpin the barrel.  Big flavors.

The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and seriously boozy on the palate with spicy oak as well.

Pours a ruddy dark coppery chestnut brown color which is completely opaque with a half finger dark tan head that quickly fades into a thin lasting ring.

Boozy bourbon aroma with lots of sweet alcohol along with caramel malt, toffee, chocolate and hazelnut. Theres also a bitnof dark fruit, most noticeably dRk cherry, plum, fig and raisin. At first it smelled a little bourbon heavy but becomes kore complex in the nose as it warms.

Slightly chewy medium body that is surprisingly spicy up front followed by sweet alcohol heat and bourbon that lingers throughout into a sweet and very hot finish.

Pours murky brown with beautiful tan head.  Surprisingly, great lacing throughout the glass.

Aroma was incredibly complex with the bourbon standing out alongside some coconut and other tropical fruity esters.  Strong molasses the whole time sipping, and then a very distinct oak nose as it warmed.

Flavor was fantastic with a deep rich caramel and molasses sweetness, balanced with the slightest hints of a roasted coffee finish.

Incredibly thick with smooth tiny carbonation.  At 17% this drank incredibly well, but you could feel the heat at the back of the throat, especially as it warmed.

2665,"2010-04-07",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 15, 2010 10oz pour at brasserie jo... Pours a dark and murky caramel raisin brown with a somewhat thin light beige head... Thick raisin and dark fruit aroma paired with a bourbon barrel and vanilla notes. Pretty smooth with a sweet profile... Flavors start off initially with a sweet dark fruit base which then evolve to a tangy type of finish which could be attributed to the wheat wine possibly.  Silky smooth mouthfeel with a bourbony smooth sweet brandy finish. Very similar to a port. Smooth.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
2665,"2010-04-06",4.1,"A: The pour is a slightly muddy dark brown color with a some reddish highlights and a thin layer of tan head.

S: The nose is quite sweet with plenty caramel and dark fruit notes with a touch of chocolate. The bourbon really comes through providing lots of vanilla and a bit of oak.

T: The flavor is quite sweet with the White Oak Sap really holding its own against the beast that is Black Tuesday. Between the White Oak Sap and Papier, the beer has quite a bit of sweet caramel and vanilla with just a touch of chocolate to it. Both the bourbon, and alcohol flavors come through, but even at such a high ABV, its not all that hot.

M: The body on this beer is massive, as you would expect from its components. Still, the low carbonation helps it from becoming too syrupy.

D: This beer is boozy and the flavor keeps you from forgetting it. However, its still quite easy to drink--dangerously, even. I cant wait for the bottles to come out.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
2665,"2010-03-21",4.0,"Had on tap at the Bruery March 20, 2010.  Very yummy beer, pours with very slight carbonation, no head, a few lingering bubbles around the edges.  Very dark brown, tan head, extreme lacing.  Smells of sugars, alcohol, molasses, vanilla, and bourbon.  Since its a combination of their Black Tuesday Imperial Stout and White Oak Sap and Papier, the flavors are very complex.  The initial hit is the strong tones of the Black Tuesday stout.  Lots of coffee and sugar - almost too sweet.  Hints of vanilla and cherries also find their way through.  Overall, a strong mixture of three awesome Bruery beers, but just a bit to sweet for me.","Orange, California, USA","Blake"

A:  Pours a nice amberish shade of brown with a nice sized off white head.  Nice retention and some lace left behind.

S:  Wow heaven in a bottle.  Lots of chocolate, dark fruit, and sweet molasses.  Notes of oak, vanilla, and a touch smoke from a chunk of burning oak.

T:  Nice mix of black cherry and dark fruit up front.  Chocolate and oak can be picked up along with dark brown sugar and molasses.  The level of oak and vanilla from the vanilla is absolutely perfect.  Can not pick up a bit of booze despite this one packing a huge punk at over 15% ABV.

The aroma is big ole bold holy shit! yummy with sticky ripe smashed plums and dates to go along with the ripest dark cherries, oak, and oak dustiness and a bit of heat. Wow! The taste is thick and chewy to start with maple syrup goodness and oak moving quickly into aged dark fruit notes like stewed raisins, plums, figs, dates and dark red cherry fruit meat. It gets slick with sludgy sweet malts to midway as maple syrup and caramel take over into the finish. This is good. I hope they can make more.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

Dried plums, cherries, and figs with lots of vanilla, bready caramels, chocolate, and a mixture of fruitcake-like fruits. Oh yea...bourbon and wood...Flavor is much of the same with a bit of a tootsie-roll taste. Chocolate, molasses, burnt caramels, wood, bourbon, dried fruits, and vanilla.

Full bodied and sticky with smooth carbonation.   For how big this is, it drinks very smoothly, a trait it shares with most of their big beers.   Still a bit too sweet for me to love.

The nose is a battle between the dark fruits and bourbon.  Stewed prunes, roast, vanilla, bourbon, raisins, a touch of alcohol, lots of complexity here.  Same with the flavor, sweet and raisiny with a roasty balance, noticeable but not overpowering alcohol, lots of vanilla, oak tannins, plum, and candied fruits.  Long lingering finish.  Mouthfeel is full and thick with light prickly carbonation that cuts the sticky texture some.  It does get a bit clingy on the finish.  This stuff was scary drinkable for this high of an ABV.  I had no idea when I started drinking this that it was 15%, I drank 2/3 of a growler before I looked here and saw it.  I dont remember deciding to go to bed that night!

Wafting. Pours a dark black-brown and a fringe in brown, not much head. Flavor is strong, strong. Theres a ton of fresh, bright bourbon, followed with a ton of oak char, heavy barrel and dry woody oak. Then a soft, potentially complex sugar develops. I cant draw much from it, because I feel the toothpick, dry-woody oak tannins really overriding the beer. Too much alcohol and just too strong. I cant get into any of the blended malt complexity with some much harsh, nasal-burning oak alcohols overriding. Not my favorite.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

Dark fruits.  Rich, but easy to drink.  The wheatwine part of the blend seems to really soften the body and mellow this rich, strong beer.  Way too easy to drink for 15%.

Intensely flavored, sweet beer with a bold alcohol presence and loads of bourbon, dark fruit, and fudgey chocolate.  Very sweet, with the dark malts lending a rich fudge-like quality as opposed to any noticeable roast.  Raisins and figs abound, lending a mild spiciness to the richness of the concentrated fruits.  The bourbon character is also pronounced, creating flavors dripping with caramel, vanilla, and an almost fennel-like oaky spice.  Heavy alcohol presence, although its soft and soothing and obviously an intended component of the brew.

Burnt wheat, backed dark fruits, molasses, a lot of alcohol, burnt sugar, vanilla, burnt wood and I could go on and on.  The beer is trying to pack too much in one glass.  It is extremely boozy.  Certainly not highly drinkable.  So roasted and alcoholised that I was getting a burnt plastic sensation.  This is a mix of three beers aged in beer barrel.
