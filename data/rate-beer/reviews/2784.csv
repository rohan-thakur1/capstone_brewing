2784,"2008-04-07",3.8,"Back from a Czech Republic pub-crawl this is part of my express ratings for the typical Světlý 11°- (Czech light Pils), Světlý 12°+ (Czech Pils), Polotmavý (Czech Amber Lagers) and Tmavý (Czech Black Lagers).  Non-typical beers will receive personalized descriptions after the express ratings.-------- />
How: Tap at brewpub (Modrá Hvězda, Dobřany, Czech Republic)
The look: Dark amber body with a large creamy beige head
To me a typical Czech Polotmavé (Czech Amber Lagers) is: Hay and biscuit wrapped in caramel.  Very light fruity notes with no specific fruits giving the impression of slightly fruity caramel.  Moderately sweet.  Sweetness is well balanced by dry grassy hops.  Body is smooth.  Medium carbonation.
This one: (Not officially a Polotmavý but it was one to me).  As above with everything pushed a bit further.  Deeper caramel, omnipresent fruity notes, stronger hop presence.  An Imperial Polotmavý?","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
2784,"2008-04-04",4.0,"En fût. Pinte dégustée directement à la brasserie. Arôme: Légère odeur de céréale grillée. Apparence: La couleur est ambrée foncée voilée. Présence dun large col mousseux et dune large dentelle sur le verre. Saveur: Goût de céréale avec une pointe de cerise et de chocolat. Durée moyenne de larrière goût. Palette: Le corps est moyen avec une texture huileuse. Faible effervescence en bouche. Arrière goût légèrement torréfié. (Rating #1661)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","TaktikMTL"
2784,"2008-03-25",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
This Dunkler Bock sends wondrously structured caramel and chocolate maltiness to dally with elevating herbal hops. Yet another fascinating strong lager from Modra Hvezda.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-That usual alluring Czech tower of foam bobs atop the black cherry cloudiness.
-The body on this one is gorgeously suave and rotund.
-Malt sweetness lasts long after the sip is finished.
-A cranberry-like fruitiness serves the malts very well.
