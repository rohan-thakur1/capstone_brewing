1199,"2015-10-23",4.3,"750mL bottled 10/14/15, drunk 10/22/15.Typical Trillium pour as far as great head retention, but not cloudy/murky and while still hazy, not intensely so (and I only let this fridge for a week. This thing would probably have cleared after a month or so).The nose wasnt all that promising from the get-go, though with warming and breathing, it seems to improve a bit on account of the maltiness edging out some of the tangy, slightly aspirin-like hoppiness/acidity. Otherwise, tons of honey, light whitebread dough, lilacs, honeysuckles and tangy, overripe tangerines and overripe white grapefruit. Quite a good strength of aroma with no alcohol. Too bad about the slight aspirin notes....Although theres just a pinch of tangy, punchy hop in the flavor, its by and large beautifully balanced and free from any resin, heavy citrus or pine. Incredibly creamy, soft and tightly carbonated texture with some latent maltiness but still well-attenuated. Light meyer lemon, spiciness, herbs and just pure late hopping flavors of tropical fruits without any resulting resin/acid burn whatsoever. The aroma not quite up to par, and I think Upper Case was a bit more explosively juicy. But this is definitely more dry/drinkable than that one, so its very close in my book. Regardless, its still a world class double IPA and good to see some breweries still can make an elegant, restrained double IPA.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

 Pours a big blonde peach hue with a big foamy long lasting head. Aroma of big potent juicy pineapple, grapefruit. Soft touch of lightly floral herbal catminte. Juicy passion fruit and orangepeel provide some pleasant tropical fruit balance. Hint of boost is noticeable, but enjoyed. Provides a fun extra dimension to the beer. Very light cateminte floral bitterness, bit in check for sure and enjoyed alongside the tropical fruitiness. Gonna say this is the best double IPA Ive ever had. Nice body. Pleasantly moderately dry.

1199,"2014-03-19",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 21, 2015 On tap in a tulip. Pours hazy golden with a lacy, white head. Aroma strong of citrusy and fruity and floral hops, plus light, crisp malts and hints of wheat. Flavor the same with a great blend. Smoother, lighter texture. A great double IPA - reminiscent of that one brewery in Greensboro, VT.  EDIT: December 2015.  4.2 -> 3.7 What the hell trillium?  Remember when your beefs were good? This is not good.  Transparent, boring, not hoppy, not good.","Connecticut, USA","jkwood04"
