Strong sour aroma with a heavy blueberry presence. Ive had lots of blueberry beers, brewing it myself too, and one thing common for all of them is that the blueberry aroma and taste is hard to capture in full.

Smells of sweet/tart fresh picked blueberries, the ever present Cantillon musty brewery funk, some mild lactic sourness, yogurt and finally some grains. Taste follows the same path with plenty of tart blueberries and lactic sourness up front followed closely by the must and finally the lightly chewy grains. Feel is slightly grainy quickly being enveloped by plenty of musty sourness and slight sweetness from the berries.

1108,"2016-02-11",3.6,"(15 cl pour from tap @ Himmeriget; 2015 vintage) Served at fridge temperature but left to sit in the glass for ten minutes to properly appreciate the aroma. Ive long abstained from imbibing this beverage knowing that I havent really developed a palate capable of appreciating spontaneously fermented beers that well. However, this offer was too good to pass on. The glass is a small footed tulip and the colour of the lambic is difficult to ascertain as the sun has set and we only have candlelights and weak spotlights by the bar. It does look like it has a Syrah-like reddish purplish hue with a little head that is somewhat lighter. As you tilt the glass the beverage seems to draw little curtains of lace. Good retention and regeneration. Aroma seems to be mostly funk at this point at least when contrasted with the Amorosa of similar vintage in the glass next to it. The funk seems to me to have soft notes of barnyard. On the palate the beverage strikes you as bone dry with a disciplined tart expression that seems rather clean and well-defined making it rather easy on the stomach. Carbonation doesnt seem to play much of a role here. Halfway through the glass and having swirled it once I manage to catch a hint of blueberry in the aroma but its elusive. To be honest 15 cl was the perfect amount for me. Enough to appreciate the experience while still leaving space to enjoy other beers.","DENMARK","humlelala"

Pours a dark purple, ember red color, with a dark pink, small head. The head collapses immediately to a glass coating sheet of lacing, revealing tiny bubbles at its edge.

The nose reveals a great blend of funky barnyard, dusty malts and unripe blueberry skin. Once the aromas open up, a ripe fruit tone becomes present, together with a mineralic quality, reminding of an actual fruit juice. Its tartness is present enough though, to prevent the beer from becoming jam sweet, also due to a light note of wood bark, wet spruces and leather.

Has a wonderful soft mouthfeel, while the beer reveals a lively, mineral accentuated carbonation, adding an utmost pleasant softness to its profound tartness.

Blueberries become visible in a prickly, unripe way and turn sweeter, once earthy malts wrap up the beers tart qualities. Berries dont get overly prominent on their own, but provide a great balance together with the present, pleasantly dry funkiness, ending with a ripe, wood accompanied, mellow sweetness. Its finish exhibits a great range of intense flavors working together with the fruits, consisting of lemon zest, a mineralic softness and a note of old, soft cheese, highlighted by the fantastic mouthfeel.

A great beer with an authentic, well integrated fruit character, which goes hand in hand with the typical Cantillon lambic sourness. Still, the most outstanding aspect of this beer is its phenomenal soft mouthfeel.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Some oak, must, light funk too but the berries are dominating which is great. Fine, relatively soft carbonation, quite some sweetness but all comes together well. Tasty and a lot better than I remember it. Still it is a bit too lemony sour for my taste, but the carbonation, mouthfeel and soft blueberry touch makes it an enjoyable drink.


Tried the 2014 edition a couple of weeks later. No lemony sourness and more dry which suits my taste better. Then again the berries had faded some, so not as much blueberry delight, so I guess the overall would be the same. Good beer.","DENMARK","SlackerMads"

Flavor is moderately acidic and slightly harsh. Moderate blueberry character. Light barnyard, earthy funk with a bit of oak. Light medicinal phenolic character. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium light carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, definitely one of my last favorite fried lambics. Blueberries just dont seem to work very well in beer and add an odd character to Brett funk. It does get better as my palate adjusts to the blueberry.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Very intense beer, you get that its a Cantillon right away, very fruity, but not overwhelmingly so - compared to for instance the Mikkeller double blueberry, which is more like a perfect blueberry drink of fruitiness.

1108,"2014-10-21",4.6,"Poured from the bottle into a tumbler glass at Øltibukken store in Copenhagen Denmark. Vintage 2014, 375ml bottle.

Big deep ruby red color like a gem. An absolute crystal clear gem, no hints of darker or lighter hues of different colors. Shines crystal clear. A faint pink head dissolves with a little bit of suds, but even manages some carbonation while in a simple conical tumbler. One of the most impressive colors on any beer I have ever seen. Doesnt get any better for a lambic.

Fascinating aroma. Bouquet fills with earth funky notes, slightly ashy but even more so with hints of garden mushroom and fresh tilled soil. Fruit angle is all over and surprisingly varied. Blueberries of course but also sour cherry, raspberry, even peach like fuzz which works out amazingly.

THe first sip is exquisite. While the fruit comes nicely with funky aromas, there is a great melding sweetness of balsamic vinegar to match. Its as if it is drizzled all over a salad bowl filled with fruits of cherry, blueberry and so forth. Great funk acid tones on this, with much of the earthy bouquet matching nicely. 

Everything is incredibly balanced with wild yeast taking the first notes, and fruit following with sweet acidic tones. Not quite Rodenbach sweetness but unique all its own. Extremely complex and balanced. The feel even for a lambic, does come off a little less impressive. Depth in malt even comes across light, but the flavors easily push through. Fun carbonation. Hinting at light seltzery qualities but never getting there from a large palate that is complex

What more needs to be said? A great lambic, probably the best blueberry beer of any style by far I have ever had. Not my favorite Cantillon, but does this get any better? No, unequivocally not even close.","","imbibehour"

Appearance - plum in colour with a creamy head that thins fairly quickly.
Nose - initially wild yeast dominates the fruit which is tight like a young red Burgundy wine. Returning after an hour, the blueberries are out in all their glory. 
Taste - again, initially this has dry leafy tannins like a young tannic wine. There is also high acidity. Youre required to search for the fruit. Then returning after an hour, the blueberry has taken centre stage and the tight tannins have relaxed while the tangy acidity is still there. 
Palate - initially a tight and tannic beer with high acidity. The texture is tight and the finish is long and dry. After breathing, the fruit comes forward.

Long lasting, though it leaves little lacing (if any) behind. Aroma is notably sour but not incredibly acetic to the nostrils. Jammy notes of blueberry & cherry, perhaps cherry even seeming stronger than blueberry. Tart, funky barnyard, LOTS of musty leather, notes of old, sopping wet corks left to rot & dry, an underpinning back-end lacto sourness, & plenty of damp wood left in the periphery. Taste, up-front, is full of pleasantly tart berry juice. Tart, but not overly sour. Being (relatively) fresh, however, this bottle is packed with fruit. Lovely blueberry, raspberry jam notes, also with big supporting notes of cherry & sour lemon. Mid-palate to finish shows more of the funky, complex side of the brew... Rotting wood, damp horseblanket, funky cheesecloth, & a finishing note of old leather. Gets more sour as it warms, bordering on puckering, but not quite there.

1108,"2013-01-29",3.6,"Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip.  2012 vintage.  From notes.

Blåbær has a blue violet hue and is moderately transparent around the edges.  There is not much carbonation and barely any head; there is just a small off-white cap.  

The main aroma is blueberries, although the smell is not that strong.  There are some tart and funky notes that give it a little more character.

The flavor reminds me more of tart blueberry skin than the whole fruit.  It has that kind of hollowed out flavor to it, like there should be a more robust fruit flavor.  Because of that, the flavor does not really change that much over the course of the sip and lacks much complexity.  The blueberry has just a touch of sweetness to go along with its moderate tartness.  There are some funky nots, and a bit of dry, oaky tannins to go along with the tartness.

The body is only somewhat sour and acidic.  The lack of sweetness or real punch, combined with the light carbonation, make it feel duller on the palate than it is, with a medium lambic body.  There is just a bit of dryness at the end of the sip.

The 11 emitted an exceptionally pungent aroma of fresh, juicy blueberries that would make most muffin aficionados jealous.  Its on the *very* short list of aromas that would get a 10/10 from me.  Taste was rather mild and boring, though.  Almost watery with barely any funk or tartness.

The 09 was exactly its opposite: nose lacked depth and pungency while the taste showed matured fruits, funk, classic Cantillon acidity, and an overall level of refinement that simply isnt in the fresher bottle.

Deep burgundy in color with slight tint of purplish ruby. Single (off-white) fingernail head on medium pour. Smells of lambic funk with notes of must, aged cheese, soft citrus, and very hidden blueberry notes. Taste follows the nose (blueberry is quite muffled). Disappointing considering fruit lambics are usually most enjoyable relatively fresh.

1108,"2012-10-20",3.6,"37.5cl 2012. Poors dark red. Foam disapears very quickly, lambic that is... Smell is very nice blueberry. Taste is average blueberry, other berries?, citric. A bit sweet and average acid. Its not a bad beer but for me this beer is overrated. There are many other Cantillons out there who are much less rare, take Mamouche for example. Many of the scores are due to the rarity I guess.","BELGIUM","tquest"

1108,"2012-08-31",4.2,"2009-2012 vertical, all 375 ml bottles. The 2009 pours haziest, and the beer gets both clearer and deeper in color as it goes from 2009 to 2012. Small ruby-tinted head on each, with 2012 disappearing relatively quickly. Aroma of blueberry, yogurt, oak, and earth; 2009 is the most sour, 2010 is the cleanest and best, with some rose petal notes, 2011 is the most vegetal and weakest, and 2012 is the sweetest (with vanilla) and fruitiest. The flavor has blueberry, leather, yogurt, wine, vanilla, and lactic acid; 2009 and 2010 are the most tart, but 10 is so, so clean. 11 is the least tart, most watery, and least carbonated, and 2012 is the sweetest and fruitiest and probably in the most need of age. 2010 is the clear winner and 2011 is the clear loser.

No head on the pour, but it is a beautiful deep purple red in color. It is slightly hazy in clarity, it looks stunning. For being a year old at this point, there is still quite a bit of blueberry in the nose, much more than I remember when I originally tried this last year. Plump blueberries and some yogurt character. Blueberry is a little more subdued in the flavor, but is still quite present. There is also lemon rind, oak, and a generous amount of funk. Light mouthfeel, good acidity, lower carbonation, and a moderate lingering finish. One of the better fruit lambics Cantillon makes, but in term of fruit lambics I think I still prefer Fou Foune, Saint Lamnivus, and Lou Pepe Kriek.","Illinois, USA","Dunt"

Batch 4.

A: This brew pours a stunning shade of deep blue, bordering on purple, with radiant crimson hues that give the beer a brilliant appearance. Sitting atop the liquid is a thick layer of lilac colored bubbles. The head retention is something to behold. I have never seen a head camp out for this duration of time, most especially on any Cantillon offering. Im not sure if its ever going to fade.

S: Distinctive and easily recognizable as Cantillon. Tart fruits and barnyard funk aromas. Its difficult to single out blueberries, though the overall aroma is fantastic.

T: Sour blueberries as fresh as they can be, balanced with enough tartness to make the beer utterly slammable. Wow. This beer is just phenomenal.

M: The feel is a bit on the thin side. If it was perhaps a tad thicker, maybe it could be even more tart and fruity?

Wild berries, ripe and unripe blueberries, slight horse blanket/barnyard, over ripe pears and some notes of the white stuff between the meat of a lemon and the peel. Really tasty and very well balanced.

1108,"2012-05-15",4.2,"There are many beers to tempt patrons on the Mikkeller Bars bottle list, but this one is right up there in the rarity stakes, so I decided to go for it. The barman wasnt sure if they had the smaller-sized bottle in stock but lo and behold he brought back an unlabelled 375ml bottle from the 2011 vintage. After halting a gush of foam the beer poured out a luscious red with a thin cap that stays for the duration. Already I could smell a mélange of blueberry, redcurrant and cherry, with a few oaky and medicinal notes too. As expected, its gorgeously lip-smacking and tart, but it doesnt go overboard. Its just perfect in this department. Oak barrel is there, smoothing out the sides. The pithy fruitiness really gets behind your teeth. No corner of your mouth is left unspared. 

Confession time: at first I found it hard not to be underwhelmed. Id heard the hype and perhaps it was no surprise that Blåbær didnt live up to it at first. But as the glass slowly emptied I found myself more and more taken in by this lambic. When there were only a few sips left I was near left near devastated!

Hints of leather and barnyard funk. Taste is tart, dry grape and barnyard funky tones with sour blueberry notes. Blueberry is present throughout the palate, with hints of zesty lemon and horseblanket towards the end. Absolutely awesome, and worth its hype without a doubt.

Wonderful blueberry notes and a grape blue color. Looks excellent. Taste is of sour funk and very sour blueberry. Not too much berry flavor in there but it does show a bit. The sour/tart is perfect and this is definitely a real treat. I think I was the only one freaking out about trying this. Everyone else was acting too cool and ""no big deal"" like. Simply awesome.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","alpar"
1108,"2012-02-02",4.7,"Cantillon Blabær Lambik pours cloudy purple and pink color.  Its a color Ive never seen in a beer before.  Beautiful.  Pink head laces the glass.  Right off the bat youll notice the fantastic aroma this beer gives off.  Oaky up front with a beautiful mixture of blueberry, leather, and funk.  The Vice Blogger thought it was one of the more sour noses and tastes he had ever had.  While I thought it was nice and sour and was actually pretty tame.  The taste is amazing.  The berries come out more here.  Everything is balanced perfectly.  Sourness, tartness, oak, funk.  Nothing got in the way of another ingredient.  The mouthfeel was one of the best qualities of this beer.  Smooth and velvety.  Medium bodied but more on the full side.","Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA","drunkenpolack"

The enticing aroma pops with tart blueberries, wood, funk and some earthy herbal notes.  I am ready for the first taste.  The flavor has the sour/tart blueberries as expected.  Additional flavors of wood, funk, earthy notes and some vinegar that all work together extremely well.  There is a moderate acidity throughout, but not enough to get in the way of an incredible experience.  Very drinkable for what it is.  With beers like this I still feel that I lack the vocabulary to fully do it justice.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"

The nose is full of burnt rubber barnyard funk, with a ton of fresh blueberry aroma and sour lemon acidity with just a bit of underlying vanilla oak treatment.  The flavor is tart and sour with a bunch of burnt rubber and earthy barnyard funk, but belongs to the fresh tart blueberries along with lemon acidity and a bit of oaky flavor as well.

Woderfully complex aroma: lots of berries and red fruits in general, hay, flowers. Lightly sweet, moderately acidic flavor, becomes moderately sour. Taste is really complex and fruity, but not sweet at all. Really sour, but still balanced thanks to the good amount of fruit presence. In the middle of the mouth, the fruity presence is typical berry tartness, with no specific reminescence of blueberris in particular if not told so. The aftertaste, though, is pure blueberries. Acidic, pretty dry finish. Medium body, lively carbonation.

Loaded with vinegar and candied sugar in the nose with a hint of tart blueberries.

Nose is straight up Cantillon funk, yogurt, sharp berry notes and a rustic barnyard note. On tasting, intensely sour and dry. Light bitterness and saify blueberry notes are in the background. The defining component in this is the dryness. The blueberry really is a subtle note, letting the lemony cantillon character dominate. Solid.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
1108,"2011-09-11",4.2,"Blåbær:
Doft: Det första som slår mig är hur mild och subtil blåbärsdoften är, den är inte lika in your face som körsbären från dess kriek eller hallonen från deras framboise. Ytterligare känner man, utöver den traditionella Cantillon-funken med sin halm och ladugård, en jordighet från blåbæren som framhäver en del alkohol, något som gjorde mig en aning förvånad. Det är inte ofta man känner alkohol i en Cantillon tycker jag.

Smak och munkänsla: Direkt känner man givetvis blåbären, mycket tydligare än i doften. Cantillonfunken jag nämnde ovan visar sig också tydligare. Därefter kommer en massa skogsbär tillsammans med lite pinje och jord i bakgrunden. Mild syra, vilket är att vänta med tanke på dess ringa ålder, med en nypa sötma som balanserar upp det hela riktigt fint. Ölen är torr och lätt och är varken komplicerad eller svårdrucken.

Utseende: 
Mörkröd/violett med en vackert rosa skum. Har inte druckit någon öl förut med den här färgen och måste säga att den är riktigt förtjusande.

Totalt: Blåbären gifter sig underbart med syran från ölen och den subtila sötman tillsammans med skogsbären gör att ölen blir en fröjd att dricka. Jag drack min första flaska Blåbær vid releasen i år och blev lätt besviken på smaken, men såhär i efterhand måste jag säga att min åsikt har skiftat. Blåbær förtjänar kanske inte all sin hype, men jag kommer garanterat köpa den nästa år trots dess höga pris, det, i alla fall, förtjänar den.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Pundarquartis"

I was fearful that I would drink it in one shot because the smell was that good. The taste was even better. Blueberries were present but not overpowering.

Im guessing that my review would be very high for an older bottle because this one just doesnt seem to have the tartness of other Cantillon and 3F fruit lambics, and more sour berry flavor would put this over the top.

Gunpowder smoke arise when releasing the cork and foam starts to build in the bottle. The beer is almost escaping on us. When poured into a glass the liquid appears deep red-purple coloured with a pink soft precautious head. Gentle aromas of blueberry soup, crushed blueberries with a light acidity to it. Softer then many other cantillons. A light sweetness, some black currant and fresh cranberries is also apparent in the nose. As the beer sits for a while more earthy lambic notes surface.
The taste is dominated by sour blueberries - What a surprise, huh?! A nice acidity, bitterness and sweetness mixes up and ties together in a wonderful way. This is what makes the beer so stunning. The body is light but the taste and flavour incredibility rich and intense, the soft carbonation does the trick and works well with the beer. Taste continues with notes of green apples, lime peel and more creamy blueberries. It coats my mouth and just doesnt go away, aftertaste is just as good as the rest of the beer.

1108,"2011-04-16",4.4,"Thank you Casey for this delicious treat. 2009 bottle. Well, there is no way that this beer could live up to the hype, so Im not setting up any expectations. Pours a dark, murky, red-purple with a thin, medium-fine rosy head. Huge barnyard aroma--damp hay, horseblanket, blue fruits--not blueberries expressly, thankfully. The flavor is quite sharp and sour, deliciously so, with a lot of the dark earthiness characteristic of Cantillon. The fruit characteristics come across quite strongly, unlike many other Cantillon fruit lambics in which the fruit is almost entirely fermented out.  Light, well-balanced body that conveys the dense flavor profile quite nimbly. Loved being able to try this, but probably wont be jumping through too many hoops to procure another bottle anytime soon.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

Beer is superbly pungent. Tons of sour coming through, acetic and lactic with some funky woodsiness that pulls the whole thing together. I could smell this all day long.

Beer is thin and light in body. Carbonation in the mouth props the body up a bit. Very sour and tart, good fruit character. I could session this all day long. Know where I can get a keg of this stuff? If I had to criticize it I would say it finishes too quickly due to the low body. I know lambics are suppose to attenuate out at a gravity near that of water, this one seemed thinner than others. If it had a little more to it, slightly more body, I feel the fruit would have popped more. Enough complaining though. This was the best lambic Ive ever had and would drink it again, buy it again, trade for it again, fly to Europe to buy a bottle.

1108,"2011-03-30",4.9,"From 11/05/10 notes. Had at a small tasting thanks to ygtbsm94; huge thanks to Brad for sharing this very sought after beer! Bottle is from Batch 3, 2007 Vintage.

a - Pours a reddish amber color with two inches of fluffy white head that has excellent rentention and leaves a little bit of lacing and light carbonation evident.

s - Smells of tart blueberry, sour fruits, brett, and oak. The blueberries arent overpowering, which makes it wonderful to smell and enjoy.

t - Tastes of blueberry, sour fruit, yeast, and brett. Hints of oak as well, but not as much as the smell. The tart blueberries come through a little more in the taste than the smell, but again, pretty amazing.

m - Medium body and low carbonation, very smooth and crazy drinkable. A little bit tart but not too lip puckering, which allows it be be drank easily. Perfect mouthfeel.

d - Wow, what an amazing beer. At 5% ABV, I feel like I could drink a whole bottle of this and still want more. Im not just marking this up due to rarity; this is one of the best beers Ive ever had and if you like blueberries as I do, youll love this one. We tried various sours at the tasting, including LeBleu and Crianza Helena and I enjoyed this one more than both of them; I came home the next day and immediately tried to trade for a bottle.

Crazy nose of hay and sourness makes you want to breath this down more than drink it. Creamy taste with funky sourness and a complex mixture of blueberries, funk, apricots and lemon zest. Beautifully balanced. Finish is dry and lactic. Glad to try, worth the hype.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Doodler"
1108,"2011-03-26",4.3,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2011 Ive had this several times now, 4 of the 6 batches. Batch 5 is by far the best if youre looking for blueberries. 

The beer pours a deep grape jelly colored purple with a nice medium pink head. The head rises about 3 fingers and is very creamy and soft with great retention and lace. Probably the best head Ive seen in a lambic. 

The aroma is medium with mostly tartness coming through, some horse blanket mostly. Its nice because you get the funkiness youre looking for but not so overpowering that you get tired of it. At the end you get a little sweetness, but not much blueberry. 

The taste is great, its super complex and well balanced. It starts soft and sweet and highly drinkable, towards the middle and end it evolves to have nice tartness. Once again, like the aroma it gets you the tartness you desire in drinking a lambic but not so overpowering that you cant drink a ton. At the end you finally get some blueberry mixed with a final tart goodbye.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

Aroma is just phenomenal: a raspberry and floral bouquet with notes of lemon and barnyard. Theres also a sting of acetone that is just enough to draw your attention without being off-putting. Flavor is immediately acidic but quickly followed by lavender, soap, cherry, and old cheesy funk. Lots of dry funk despite the sharp acidic quality that lingers.

Aroma had sourness, fruitiness and blueberries. Palate was medium bodied and quite fizzy with medium carbonation. Flavours were sourness, blueberries, fruitiness, tartness, mildly grapefruit and very low bitterness. Aftertaste was fruity, tart and sour. I didnt know what to expect when I opened this bottle. The high ratings I knew but that was all. The beer lacked tartness and sourness which I like in lambics and that made the taste a bit disappointing. Otherwise a nice brew.","Helsinki, FINLAND","mjs"

1108,"2011-02-26",4.1,"Deep violet murky beer with a small pale purple head that pretty much, surprisingly sticks around for a minute.
On first whiff, smells like the rest of Cantillons offerings. But coming back to it every now and then reveals a complex layering of other aromas. Little sweetness that is absent from others, little fruitiness (different fruitiness) than some more. Overall a pleasant fruit filled barn.
Sour up front, and sour in the back. Just like their other brews. The blueberry lends a very complex characteristic to this that is hard to put my finger, erm tongue, on. I like it though.
Same as the rest of the Cantillon brood. Little thinnish, the sourness sticks around between each sip. But not unpleasant whatsoever.
Very drinkable. I could quaff these all night if it werent for the sour barrage unleashed on my tongue. I like sour, but you can only drink so many in an evening before you tongue gets pickled.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"

1108,"2011-02-06",4.5,"375 ml bottle from Wavers. Thanks, Baker! Rating #2000, 2009 - Batch 4. Pours a wicked blueberry hue, purple red murky pour, rusty, dark with lighter notes, a huge cakey pink head sits atop, laces well and stays pretty big. Wine hued and murky, frankly quite gorgeous with a fluffy pink head that laces well. Aromas are amazingly sour, blueberries and funky bretty horseblanket, lemons, wet oak, bready malts come in behind with a spritzy nature, lactic acid. Horseblanket and bretty funk really start to assert itself, sour blueberries and lemons, dusty funk. Wet oak comes in stronger now as it warms a bit more. Initial is luscious blueberries, sourness dialed back a bit, lemons and wet oaky tannins make way into a bigger bretty funk, leather and horseblanket, hay and dust. Blueberries and berry back into the fold, juicy berries and sour juice, melons. Blueberry tannins, generic berry (raspberry in addition to blueberries), funk, dust, and oak. Really well crafted, not a sour bomb, bringing the funk power, but not losing its sour and juicy blueberry roots. It just keeps getting better further into it, warming a touch. Touches of yogurt and sour blueberries, blueberry tannins and oak lingering in the finish, funky brett sticks around on the palate, dry. Yogurt grows stronger. Good sour, funk, and flavors. Great drinkability, balance for a beer of its type. The acidity stays at bay a bit, but remains a nice sour kicker. A winner.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
1108,"2011-01-20",4.7,"UPDATED: MAY 15, 2011 2009 375ml bottle shared with Weisguy for a mini lambic tasting.
Served a bit too cold, but hey, its January in Michigan. Poured a blueberry pulp red with lots of purple and a nice frothy white head. Immediate smell is vinegar even after just uncapping! The nose definitely foreshadowed the taste as it packs a powerful acidic kick in the mouth. Bit of sparkling fruit soda mid-taste & on the palate, but very enjoyable. Tastes very similar to Cantillon Kriek and its hard to get much blueberry out of the beer until sampling the last 4 ounces of dregs/sediment. The surprising acidity of the beer (for a 2009) burns lightly on the finish. Extremely drinkable. 8/4/8/5/17

Pours a deeply purpled carmine. Theres a thin ring of lightly pink-hued head, but little lacing. 

Ripe, muddled blueberries and a minor funkiness that reminds me of blue cheese. As it opens, the soured blueberry character becomes more and more vibrant. 
Tart blueberries , some lactic acidity, and the tangy/sweet interplay of fresh black currants. The first sip was quite sour and masked some of the complexities lying underneath, which show their face as the beer warms. Sometimes the more complex something is, the more difficult it is to describe without appealing to more and more adjectives. Fewer is appropriate here: beautiful, wild berry flavor; ripe and almost-ripe blueberries; a soft mustiness.

1108,"2010-10-27",5.0,"375 bottle, batch 5, thanks to alfrantzell, a generous guy and great friend!

Well...what is there to say about this beer that hasnt already been said by one person or another?  The cork comes out with a slight pop, certainly not the great bang I was expecting, but nevertheless the beer is very properly carbonated.  The pour is a gorgeous violet hue.  The minute the bottle opened, I had a powerful rush of blueberries to the nostrils.  The beer has a wonderful lactic quality to it, slight barnyard funk, and a very, very minor touch of acetic acid.  Certainly, this nose is absolute perfection for a lambik, tart but not painfully so.  The mouthfeel is divine, not champagne-like but also nowhere near flat.  I used to prefer my lambik with a lot of carbonation, but this is just right.  Theres a light berry sweetness leading the rush of flavors.  The lactic tartness doesnt come in until the middle of the palate, giving the mind plenty of time to reflect on what its like to taste a delicious blueberry cheesecake slice.  The back of the palate is hit with the funk, the sour, and somehow, the lasting taste of blueberry.  In the end, I am left wondering what else a person could possibly want from this beer.  It perfectly melds rich and luscious fruit flavors with a tart but balanced palate, and it drinks really smoothly.  Cantillon has reached true beer nirvana, and Im grateful for the opportunity to drink such a (relatively) fresh and fine example.","Florida, USA","HonusWagner"

Ive never been able to smell a beer that clearly from that far away. Taste is sublime. Honestly, not really a fault. The blueberry is forefront, and its that real ""crushed them in my fingertips while stumbling on a blueberry patch in the woods"" taste, slight woodiness and then a fantastic tart, funkiness to finish.

Very sour aroma, but also a note of sweet black currant candies. The flavour is very sour and bone dry. I think the very sour taste overpowers the flavour compounds, that may be there.

A: pours an amazing deep purple, with a cream and purple colored small head. Able to see through the beer when held to the light.

S: smells of the distinct cantillon funk. Pure lambic all the way. Notes of lactic acid, freshly picked tart blueberries/raspberries. Musty wet hay, earthy horseblanket funk.

T: similar to the smell in that its cantillon all the way. Tart Blueberries, lacto, earthiness, light oak, tannic blueberry skins, very vinous and similar to red wine. Finishes nice and dry.

M: extremely drinkable. Not too berry sweet and not way too sour either. Great lively mouthfeel with perfect carbonation. Finishes crisp and dry with a great lingering tannic blueberry and sour lambic flavor.

1108,"2010-08-04",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 12, 2013 This is a stunningly good looking beer. It has a deep red/purple pour with a beautiful pink head. Possibly the best looking beer Ive ever seen. Aroma has a lot of the classic Cantillon tartness, lots of barnyard, horse blanket, fresh blueberries, strong oak notes, small hints of mint, forrest berries, yeast. I really love the berries in this one. The taste has a good deal of sourness, oak and yeast and of course, a lot of nice blueberries. There is a fantastic balance between the tartness from the yeast and the oak, and the fresh sweetness from the blueberries. As is warms, the beer gets more of the fruity notes, creating an even more sophisticated balance between sweet and sour. Dry finish along with a really nice carbonation level. This is truly a good beer.

Vintage 2007. Deep red pour. Aroma is not as fruity as the 10, more tart, a small amount of blueberries funny enough, lots of læder, barnyard, brett, horse, Torben, oak and vanilla. Taste is insanely tart and dry. Not much fruit or sweetness, just bone dry and tart. A decent oak quality. Maybe hints of blueberry, marzipan and vanilla. Doesnt have the balancing sweetness like the 2010.

Vintages 2011/2012 had these side-by-side in fall 2012, and the 2012 was without a doubt the best. Amazing fresh and sweet blueberry nose and velvety and sweet berry note that melded amazingly with the not so old lambic. The 2011 was very different in the base lambic, much more intensely barnyardy and bretty. The berries were more subdued, although still evident. The 2012 is by far the best vinage Ive had!","Copenhagen (formerly Aalborg), DENMARK","phredrik"

Up the stairs to the barrel room he scampers. The sound of a mallet. He reappears with a glass.

Its deep purple, lighter around the edges, and still. Blueberries, thick in flavor, yet dry and lightly tart. I believe this is for Batch 2 of 2010. Not yet sour or funky, but the taste finishes on a note of oak.

Despite the stillness, Blåbær is thicker than the still Rosé de Gambrinus I had next to it. In fact its almost creamy. This is already a knockout. I wouldnt have the patience to bottle this and then let it referment, but thats why he works for Cantillon and Im the one writing the review.","The Court of the Crimson King, California, USA","afrantzell"

Most unique looking beer Ive seen, a smooth maroon-purple color with a puffy strawberry milkshake head. Cantillon nose, lots of bright fruit and acidity with wheat and a bit of stable.The blueberry connects through the acidity and is reminiscent of berry-lambics, a framboise most so. Flavor is similar though a bit less complex, the blueberry a bit stronger and sweeter, rather skin-like, accented by how dry it is. The carbonation is soft enough to appreciate the berry sweetness in balance with the lambic base. Id prefer a bit more blueberry in the nose and more stable in the flavor, and on the whole, comes off as Cantillon does blueberry (unlike the Lamnivus).

A: Rich reddish-purple body with a lively, bubbly pink head. Held on for quite some time before receding. Never quite died down though. Nice sticky, spotty lacing.
S: Bold, sweet blueberries. Light funky-tartness. Subtle vinegar undertones.
T: Absolutely incredible. The blueberries here are very refined. In general they give off a slightly sweet character, but are deliciously tart and sour as well. There is a nice lambic acidity that contributes an earthy, vinegar funk to round out this delightful beverage.
M: Light bodied with a nice effervescent, yet restrained carbonation level. Smooth with a nice crisp dry finish. The only knock on this here is the blueberry sludge, which I am assuming is left over blueberry skins which settled into the last sip of the glass. Slightly off putting, but a marginal flaw at most.

1108,"2010-06-08",4.5,"UPDATED: FEB 2, 2016 Sampled at DC Epic Sour Tasting 2010.  So glad I got to try three different batches of this.  Batch 1 - The best, in my opinion.  Pours a totally clear, orange amber with a soft white head.  Nose is very musty, like a blueberry muffin thats molded over, grassy, farm, dust, spice, celery.  Flavor is nice, tart, sour, lemony, berry skins, grassy, hay, dusty, spices, white pepper.  Very puckering, full bodied, tart without being too acidic.  This is a total gueze and very nice.  Batch 2 - The first thing you notice is that the color is totally different.  This glass is a hazy purple, nearly opaque.  The aroma is more musty and has a lot more berry.  Flavor has TONS more berry, more funk but more acid too.  Almost jammy.  Plenty of Band Aid in both nose and flavor too.  Batch 3 - Crystal clear pink color.  Three batches, three totally different looks.  The flavor and nose are both weaker than batch 2 and batch 1 for that matter.  This is not nearly as funky as batch 2 either.  This was basically like drinking 3 different beers.  Im certainly not complaining though...*****Sampled the 2011 vintage in January 2016.  Nose you could smell all day long.

Super smooth on the palate although quite sour.  Definitely more geuze like than fruit lambic.  Excellent brew. 4.0      Batch 2 rating:  Thanks to tarheels86.  Totally different!  Deep ruby pour, slightly murky.  YOu can actually get blueberry in the nose.  Is much more acetic.  Very similar sour level to the cantillon kriek.  Really really nice sour.  Much more acetic and much more blueberry than the batch 1.  Very pleasant and drinkable. 4.4  Batch 3 rating:  thanks to ygtbsm94.  mellowed out.  Much better head and retention.  Definitely increased carbonation from batch 2, though softer mouthfeel, less blueberry, and less body.  3.9  Batch 5 rating bottle thanks to wavers1.  Poured a deep ruby with a light pink, thin head.  Nose is tart berry and apparent sourness.  If blind, I wouldnt have placed it as blueberry alone.  More mixed cherry/blackberry. Funk.  Taste was not as sour/funky as nose indicates, but very tasty and balanced.  Mouthfeel was smooth, not as tart, balanced between full berry flavor, tartness, and more berry.  Very berry.

750mL 2007-1 Batch 2 black foil courtesy of madsberg. This is a totally different lambic all together. This pours like a kriek that is on crack- straight up opaque purple with a billowing purple head that is insane. Blueberry seeds tumble into the champagne flute. Nose is full of band-aid, goes almost chemical, and has some baked cherry pie that comes through if you give it a chance. Taste is more acidic, full of sour cherries, blueberry skins. Way different. Blind tasting either batch 1 or batch 2 I would not put as a blueberry lambic. I would put batch 1 as unblended, and 2 as a kriek.

Blåbær (Im still not 100% sure how to say the name of this beer) pours a dark but fairly clear purplish color, really stunning, with a one-finger head that has pinkish hues. This is not the appearance I expected after having had other blueberry beers. I like it a lot.

Aroma is very nice, but not a standout for a Cantillon fruit lambic. Cantillons signature yeast is ever-present. Bretty funk and lactic notes as well as a substantial blueberry presence.

The flavor is intense sour blueberries (not too sour though) and a little funk. I got some grape flavors in there as well, and definitely some vinegar notes. I poured it out in 3 increments, and I feel like the flavor got more intense toward the bottom of the bottle.

The palate is somewhat typical for a Cantillon fruit lambic, which is to say its awesome. Theres really a great tingling that you get on the mouthfeel that almost chokes you up. That is a very good thing. Body is medium and mouthfeel is lively. Medium level of acidity for the style.

Very drinkable. I kept coming back for another sip, and my girlfriend, who I shared this with, had to get me to slow down so she could have some. What an excellent beer. I dont know if I could rank it over some of the Lou Pepe beers with age on them, but then again, this beer could probably be pretty damn incredible with age too. Looking forward to trying this one again.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"

1108,"2010-02-28",4.2,"This review is of a Batch 4 bottle (2009)

A: The pour is a fantastic looking deep purple color with a fluffy pink head on top.

S: The nose is certainly very fruity, but I dont necessarily detect a lot of blueberries. There are some great cherry, raspberry, and a mixture of other tart berries. There is also a lot of lactic tartness, but not as much in the way of funk or wood as you usually expect from Cantillon.

T: Like the nose, the fruit is really the star of the show in this beer. A mix of indistinguishable tart berries really hits you up front. The oak comes through a bit more in the flavor, but is not overpowering. While I had been noting a lack of blueberry flavor, they really come out on the finish.

M: The body is medium to full with a nice tingly carbonation on the tongue.

D: This is one of the most fruit forward lambics/wild ales Ive come across. I really enjoyed the balance of the fruit and the traditional funk and sourness.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

Slightly tart and very puckering with a lot of musty barnyard funk. Not very acidic with a lot of earthy oaky tannis. Lots of dark fruit notes that adds to the sweet vinous, vinegary character.

1108,"2010-01-11",4.5,"2009 vintage (batch 4)

A hazy reddish pink color with a small pink head that settles fairly quickly and leaves a ring of lacings.

The first thing to appear  in the smell is Cantillons funky house character of hay, earth and a hint of vinegar. Then, the fruit aromas appear - both tart green apples and ripe (almost overripe and fermenting) red apples, and fragile yet prominent notes of blueberries. Everything feels very rustic and genuine, no artificial fruit flavors in sight. Being a fruit lambic from Cantillon, the smell is very balanced and sober, not even close to harsh.

The taste showcases a flawless balance between tartness and sweetness, and again this beer feels relatively balanced and tidy. The sourness isnt as puckering as in some other beers from Cantillon. Instead it showcases an amazingly balanced complexity. The mild sweetness has a pleasant fruit character. Lots of aromas of apples, lemon peel and goose berries. Lots of blueberry flavors - but they are not overly prominent. At first, the blueberries has a somewhat sweet character and really give the beer a unique overall character. But heres lots of tartness going on which levels the sweetness, and in general the beer is quite sour. Hints of vinegar and lactic acid. Pleasant funky notes of wet hay, earth and brett. Hints of wheat. The finish has a very subtle grassy bitterness to it and nice oak barrel flavors. Hints of tart blueberries, minerals and funk lingers on in the mouth.

Moderate body and sparkling carbonation. Feels like a sparkling white wine in the mouth, but unfortunately the carbonation is slightly too exaggerated and it gets somewhat inharmonious. Dry finish.

A unique and really good beer. But some aspects of it arent as great as the overall character. It doesnt showcase the same ""in your face-attitude"" as some other beers from Cantillon. Instead, as noted above, its really well balanced and very complex. Despite its few kinks, a masterpiece.

---

Some brief notes about batch 5, released in the fall of 2009:

The same lovely color as batch 4. The smell is also very similar to the older batch, perhaps the blueberry aromas are slightly more prominent. The big difference lies in the mouthfeel and in the way the blueberries appear in the taste. The blueberries are slightly more pronounced, especially in the finish were they are very noticeable (and very tasty with a genuine and rustic character). This gives the beer a slightly new expression and I really enjoyed it. The level of carbonation is somewhat lower in this batch and the beers seems a little smoother. All in all, its still a great beer.

1108,"2010-01-03",4.1,"2009 bottle.  Pours a deep, opaque blood red with a really pretty cotton candy, rosy head that settled into a soapy haze.  So pretty.  Tart and acidic on the nose.  Has a soft element that I really liken to 3 Fonteinen Hommage at about 1 year.  Soft blueberries and raspberries.  Pretty meaty.  Soft and quite well integrated in the mouth.  Deep blueberry skins and stems abound.  A little foresty, pretty wild, quite rich.  Brett isnt huge though its quite sour and funky.

A - Pours purple/dark blue with a pink fluffy head. Lots of sticky lacing is left behind once the head dies down a bit. The look of this beer is unlike anything Ive ever seen...something to be seen, no doubt about it!

S - Blueberry funk/tart, mellow sweetness, and light acidic notes. Its hard to put into words the perfection of this blueberry lambic, so pardon me if I just comment how awesome it is by saying, ""its awesome"".

T - Well, what do you think it tastes like? Uh...blueberries? Yeah, Id say so. Sweet blueberries, sour blueberries, funky blueberries. However youd like your blueberries, this lambic dishes it out. A nice acidic bite but nothing too strong. This one stays pretty mellow when compared to the nose.

M - Light, nice fizzy carbonation that cover the palate well. This is a great beer to swish around on your mouth and enjoy slowly. A nice rich finish, that I really enjoy.

1108,"2009-11-04",4.4,"2009 bottle.  A rich, gorgeous velvet purple pour and a pillowy crown of pink.  Blasts of blueberries and funk in the nose; beneath, vanilla, gritty fruit sugars, and minerals are just little accents on this massive, jammy juiciness, so rich and compelling atop the intimidating funk of cantillon.


Taut, punchy flavor of lemons and blueberries, tannins and oranges; the blueberries are so palpable that much like the freshest fruit they bring out hints of other fruits buried inside; the funk is way underneath this and plays a perfect complimenting role, which is much better to me than the confronting role it plays in foufone or saint lamvinus, for this purpose at least.  Its detailed, not complicated, and the blueberries shine; lightly salty afterward.

Tight, full palate, brisk and puckering, giving an almost rich chocolate like blueberry flavor in the finish; intricate and impressively harmonious.  Ty knew how bad i wanted this, thanks a ton buddy!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Batch 2 - 2007 - 375ml

A - Wow, Ive never seen a beer this color... As I pour this deep purple lambic almost 2 fingers of pink stained tan head rises and settles after a few seconds.

S - The second I started pouring this I could smell the blueberries. When youre nose deep in the glass there is a strong acidity and a nice healthy funk, lovely barnyard and cheese.

T - Frickin awesome. Not the sourest Cantillon Ive had, but definitely packs a punch. It blend very well with the funk going on as well. The blueberries are also the most present out of Cantillon fruit lambic that Ive had. It might just be in my head but I swear the blueberries also add to the sourness, as if they were picked early.

M/D - This one was carbonated pretty well and probably one of the only things I could find I didnt like about, and I was trying pretty hard. 
Rarity and price aside, I could drink this any day of the year, I would just need 30 minutes to lose myself in it.

1108,"2009-08-14",4.3,"Review #1000.  I cant thank Jan enough for the opportunity to try this rarity, a 375mL bottle, 2007 vintage.

The cork came out with an impressive pop.  Pours a gorgeous hazy purplish red with a fizzy lavender head that recedes fairly quickly but does hang around as a cap for the duration.  Lacing is spotty.

The aroma is very interesting and the blueberries were evident right as I popped the cork and they seemed fairly sweet and sugary.  However, once in the glass the aroma become much more pungent and trademark Cantillon.  Its got the strong tart blueberries, a strong vinegar acidity and a healthy dose of funk.  A strong, complex and overall stunning nose.

The taste is more of the same with a strong vinegar presence up front with the blueberries coming in on the tart side of things.  There is a faint sweetness in there, but not nearly as sweet as that initial blueberry smell in the nose.  The finish is dry with lots of funk and lots of tart fruit.

The mouthfeel is spritzy with lots of carbonation and very dry and funky on the palate.

Well, Ive certainly been looking forward to this one and it didnt disappoint.  Its got lots of funk and vinegar but its much more balanced (for me) than some of the other Cantillons Ive had.  Wonderfully balanced and deserving of the praise.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

1108,"2009-07-18",4.3,"2007 Bottle, THANK YOU JAN & CHARLOTTE! Bright deep opaque magenta with fizzy head that does not last. Pure blueberry wafting from the bottle when the cork is popped but in the glass becomes less fruity and more about the Cantillon house character. Has a complex aroma of sour funk and blueberry jam spread on top of a nice slab of wood. Other organic smells also creep in, pineapple rind. Then tart, earthy, and phenolic aromas. The palate is fizzy and prickly. Wow, the beer is lip-puckeringly tart at first and was not noticing the blueberry either. As my palate attenuates it becomes very fruity as well as sour and the beer finishes dry and earthy. As it warms it becomes much more complex and much better as the flavors emerge. More and more drinkable too as the fruits and grains come out to add some sweetness. Lends itself to sipping and contemplation. Excellent.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"

1108,"2009-07-10",4.1,"2009 bottle, thanks to KimJohansen for trading me one of these from Denmark. Wish I knew this thing was going to explode all over my kitchen counter, losing the first half-glass. Appearance is deep ruby red, cloudy, with a fine pink bubbly head. Some dark sediment settles to the bottom. I got excited, waiting for a wonderful plethora of fruity blueberry and serious barnyard funk, yet was let down at first quaff. Just a bit less complex and robust than I thought. Nose starts with funky cheese, light horseblanket / must, and biscuit. Wheres the blueberry? Flavor finally delivers blueberry, some cherry and a light citric character. Very balanced with smooth transitions, but overall seems to lack depth. Palate is smooth, finishing mildly tart with spritzy carbonation. Overall, a great beer that is balanced and highly drinkable, but I was expecting much more from both the blueberry and the funk. Not much of a desire to go after it again.","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"
1108,"2009-07-09",4.0,"2009 vinage shared by Justin at the 6/27 Del Mar Doom.  Hmmmm, well, to start ... this thing blew up after opening.  Gusher x 10.   A gorgeous looking beer (I see this word a lot in its reviews, but its the most fitting) ... but the flavor is not nearly what I was expecting.  I couldnt pick out too much blueberry (very faint), nor much funk to speak of.  This actually fairly easy to drink w/ a quickly fading sour finish.  Wasnt stomach churning by any means.  Are the ratings rarity driven?  Is the 09 batch not up to par?  Granted, by rating will just about match the avg, but I guess I was expecting more?

1108,"2009-06-27",4.3,"750ml. 2009. Cold out of the fridge and this one is a gusher! Watch out! 
The first thing I notice about this beer is the absolutely striking appearance. Pours an absolutely gorgeous ruby pink with an amazingly frothy bright pink head. Aroma yields loads of Cantillon funk. Earthy minerals and gravel seem to override any essence of fruit. A big sniff yields just the smallest hint of tart, dried blueberry skin. Tart and acidic for sure. Earthy, funky, dirty and leathery despite all of the fruit. Cobwebby and slightly musty basement. Flavor actually shows the fruit more than the nose. A  most excellent melange of fruit, barrel and sour yeast. Not nearly as bracing in its sourness as Fou Foune or the Lou Pepes. Shows quite a bit of balance. Earthy, leafy and funky yet retains some of the blueberry skin tannins. Wonderful in its simplicity. Lush and amazingly creamy texture. Fully alive with flavor leading to a very pleasant acidity and a lightly tannic finish. Wow! Thanks a ton Nilkas! Beautiful beer all the way around.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"

A: Pours a nice deep berry red with a fizzy head with a pink tinge. Little retention and no lace.

S: Nice funky sour aroma. The berries are there but they are of the sour sort. 

T: Nice and acidic up front. The berries come out in the middle. They are in fact sour like early season strawberries with a blast of under ripe blueberries. Hints of citrus peek through along with the funky tartness found in all Cantillions.

The blueberry is not sweet, rather tannic and reminiscent of the skins. Not as citric as I expected. Very light and fluffy feel. Minerally upfront- quite fruity in the flavor. Way less tartness/sourness than I expected. Soft blueberry skins and mild lactic character are evident in the fluffy body. Light, fluffy, fruity and gentle. Not as wild nor sour as I expected it. Still its a great Lambic, but I want to try the older vintages now, which according to past ratings had less fruit presence and more lactic wildness.","Flushing, New York, USA","PilsnerPeter"

1108,"2009-01-04",4.3,"I’ve had this twice.  The rating is mostly from our ridiculous lambic tasting during GABF 2007; it has been adjusted based on a few sips I had at Alesmith during RBSG 2008 that were better than I remembered it being.  Mauve in the glass with a light pink head.  Smells mostly of gueuze acidity as all Cantillon lambics do.  My first sample wasn’t fruity in the smell at all, but the second sample was wonderfully full of fresh, warm blueberry goodness.  As with all Cantillon beers, the initial burst of acidity is golden.  Blueberry in the first sample was most noticeable as a burst in the beginning of the finish, but the berries rode the initial fizziness of carbonation in the second sample and were more apparent throughout.  The first sample was much earthier and more subtle.  Both were delicious, but in different ways.  I’d love to have more of this in the future.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Anyway, as I’ve said many times before, I am not Cantillon’s biggest fan as I don’t always find their beers very drinkable due to the higher acidity than in some of the other lambics.  However, some of them are good and I have Jeppe and he is a great guy, so it’s great that he got the chance to brew something there.  For me the overriding aroma was very farmyardy, especially smelling it straight from the bottle.  The fruit then comes through in the glass.

As soon as I popped the crown the cork began to magicly slowly rise as if it wanted to be set free.  No issues with foaming though.  Pours a beautiful shade of purple-pink with a small fizzy pink head that retained as a thin covering and a small ring.  Wow, the nose is just great, sour funky blueberries with lots of musty and woody notes.  A little bit of stinky cheese and yogurt like funkiness.  Bracingly tart and acidic, its hard believe that the 2005 vintage can get much more tart.  Theres an extremely authentic blueberry flavor that takes center stage even with all of the classic Cantillon house character.  The finish is just bone dry with lots of musty gueuze like notes of damp cellar and wood.  Though the blueberries are quite sour, theres just a little bit of sweetness up front that makes me think of chocolate covered blueberries.  Medium bodied and super dry with perfect pinpoint soft carbonation and a lingering acetic finish.  Overall, this beer was just excellent, the fruit was just so vibrant and fresh tasting.

Rating: 4.1 /8/4/8/4/18
A vigorous pour produces a very, large bubble consistency, initially fat-one-finger thick, pale off white colored head.  The beer is a ruddy, light plum color and shows a lightly hazy, pink-tinged, copper color when held up to the light.  The aroma is quite tart, with lactic notes up front and then butyric acid notes of Brett induced funk as a backdrop.  A fruit skin aromatic note seems just perceptible, with maybe some imagined berry notes.  Funk driven aromas of urea, funky-phenolics, damp horse blanket, some musty notes as well as some fruit-like acidity.  I definitely think that the blueberry still contributes to the nose, it is quite soft, and I wouldnt have noticed it if I didnt notice this was a blue-berry beer, but it definitely adds something.

Bracingly tart as expected from a Cantillon product.  As the head suggested this is only lightly carbonated, perhaps a touch more than a  cask conditioned, real ale; the carbonation adds a hint of liveliness and more a texture than anything.  The beer finishes with a touch of medicinal blue-berry character, though really the fruit character adds a slight roundness to the flavor that mellows the bracing sourness just a touch through the middle and finish of each sip.  The substantial tartness reminds me a bit of sour-grapefruit, though the sourness is by and large contributed by lactic acid.  Quite light, and if it wasnt so acidic it would be down right quaffable; this is even on the light side for a Lambic as it doesnt have an overly tannic structure to it that many have.

As the beer warms up the soft, non-specific, fruitiness becomes more noticeable.  It really helps to soften the acidity, though to be honest for a sour beer lover the acidity was not too much to begin with.  I could see many people having a hard time finishing a beer this sour.  Fairly funky, though not over the top like the sourness.  This has the requisite farmyard funk, some sweaty blanket notes and some wild mushroom character that provides a complexity boost behind the dominant sourness.

I believe this actually is a bit more sour than the Vintage 2007 version, but it also has less blueberry character, which makes the sourness a bit more pronounced.  And this is most definitely on the hard side for a Lambic and even for a Cantillon; luckily I really find a bracing acidity quite nice, despite that fact that I can feel a slight burn in my stomach.  I wonder how much this has changed since being bottled?  Ill never know, but I suspect the blueberry was just a bit more noticeable.  Very nice, I havent had a hard Lambic in a while & this one definitely fit the bill and tickled my fancy.
Vintage 2007; Sampled April 2008
Pours with a frothy, initially two-finger thick, purple-pink stained tan colored head.  The beer is a deep purple color, but shows a deeply hazy, plum-red color when held up to the light.  As I was pouring this beer a scent of blueberries was noticeable.  A closer inspection is much more accented towards the funky Lambic notes; lots of funky, phenolic, bandaid like aromatics, a definite acidity, ample butyric acid notes, musty cotton balls and cured leather.  Behind all of this is a subtle, yet zesty, berry character that is distinctly of sweet-ripe blueberries; the blueberry notes are almost more noticeable in the nose when you are not trying.

Bracingly tart, with a fantastic sourness that almost causes me to pucker.  I would swear that the ample sourness is magnified by tart fruit character, though it is mostly lactic in make up.  The finish has a mouth-coating tannic character to it that is deeply stained  with berry skin flavors.  The flavor of this beer is not quite as funky or phenolic as the nose suggested, but this is definitely on the funky side of the spectrum with light bandaid phenolics and moldy cotton ball notes.  The tannins, fruit and oak contribute a nice heft to the body of this brew though a zippy carbonation keeps this on the airy / light side; overall this is a beer to be quaffed in quantity, just like a Lambic should be.

As the beer warms up it picks up a bit more fullness and the acidity seems to mellow just a touch, becoming a bit more fruit accented, though still bracingly dry and tart.  I really like the tannic structure that this beer has, it gives it a texture that is quite akin to the feeling while drinking black tea; this somehow provides some balance to this beer.  My second pour seems to get just a touch of ripe-berry character to it, just enough to add an ephemeral touch of sweet fruit character without actually adding any sweetness.  This is just getting more and more drinkable, it didnt start out a slouch either, and I am suddenly left wondering what happened to my 750ml bottle & asking myself why I dont have more to drink right now.

Wow, this is supposed to be the less tart / funky of the two vintages; I cant imagine (or is it cant wait) the 2005 vintage I have waiting for me being more sour than this.  This is just quite funky right now, this definitely leans towards the hard side & I wonder how much of this has developed since bottling; especially since I see this as being less tart and more fruity than the 2005.  This is fairly fruity, but certainly not in a dominant fashion (even by authentic Lambic standards), the fruit seems to more contribute to the tartness and tannic qualities of this beer rather than the ripe berry notes one might expect in a beer described as fruity.  After having said all that, this is just a fantastic beer, as someone who really likes funky, sour beers and my fruit to be a supporting player, well this just hits the spot quite well.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

1108,"2008-01-09",4.0,"750mL bottle, 2007 vintage, courtesy of Papsoe.  Thanks, Henrik!  Pours a murky, red raspberry color with a grape tinge; fluffy pinkish head with medium-bubbled lacing.  Plenty of sweat, salt, horseblanket, and tart reddish fruit in the aroma; also an inky, pitty / vinegar note that adds something quite pleasant here; the blueberries finally come through at a distance.  Medium-to-full mouthfeel: nice tartness and red fruits / blueberries; a fair amount of fruit skins, pittiness, and deep inky fruit juice; some funk and horseblanket and lightly wooded; not a huge amount of fruit length on the palate; medium finish showing inky blueberries and tart citrus and fruit pits; a bit of bread and funk.","Petaluma, California, USA","kmweaver"
1108,"2008-01-09",4.0,"UPDATED: JUN 6, 2010 2007. Sample from kmweaver. Deep, dark red/maroon with a large reddish pink head, fading to a cover. Funky sour nose with band aid, light berry, horseblanket and cheese. The flavor is moderately sour, lightly sweet with berry, melon, lemon, lactic acid, leather and oak. Medium body is soft with moderate carbonation. Nose is disappointing, but everything else shines. 2005, opened on 6/6/10.  Big sour nose, the fruit is almost completely faded, cotton candy, lots of lemon. The taste is nicely sour, lots of fresh citrus, yogurt, cotton candy. Lovely stuff, but more of a straight lambic than a fruit lambic. 8/4/9/5/18 = 4.4  2007, black foil, batch 2, opened on 6/6/10. Totally different beer. Nose is much more fruity, but has a distinct band-aid note. Taste is slightly less sour than the 05, much more fruity, can get a decent amount of the blueberry, the citrus is completely covered up. Decent. 7/4/7/4/15 = 3.7.  2007, gold foil, batch 3, opened 6/6/10.  Ahh, awesome nose, unlike the previous, no band-aid here, can really pick up the fruit. Taste is decently sweet, moderately tart, isnt as ""hard core"" as the others, but quite delicious. Really an excellent beer. 9/4/8/4/17 = 4.2","Beltsville, Maryland, USA","ryan"

1108,"2008-01-06",4.0,"Bottle, with Fin, Loz and Traci at our Belgian Beer Tasting (Part II). Unclear burgundy blue/red, pink-ish tan head. Murky warm berry aroma, mint, cake, tom-cat walking upwind, and a bit of something that reminds me of the earthy oxidizing iron smell of an old farm tractor. Powerful mouth-drying tannins. Berry skins in an interesting dark way that makes me think of iron filings. A nice level of restrained tartness under the tannin. Interesting and very unique.

Im not really that familiar with bluberries and so i likened the aroma to that of brambles, it reminded me of one of those warm late summer early autumn days when out picking blackberries. The first sip just sucks every last bit of moisture out of your mouth almost like inserting a vacuum cleaner in their really quite a Wow never had a beer with such amazing tannin level.

1108,"2008-01-02",4.5,"A Mes & Sim rate: 37.5cl bottle at my sisters house in Manchester.First a little story. In May we went to the amazing Ølbutikken with Chris_O and David Rastacouere. Chris and David had already let Jeppe know they were coming so he had bottles of Blåbær waiting when they arrived. As I was unannounced there was none for me but I left with a promise from Jeppe that he would make sure I got a bottle at some point. A couple of months later I get a beermail from him saying he is sending me a bottle over with Jens Ungstrup who was attendding the excellent RBESG in Glasgow on the condition that we promised to drink it on a romantic night in with a fresh palate. Well it wasnt quite a romantic night in but we supped it in Manchester to celebrate the birth of my sisters little boy. Seemed a fitting tribute. It also seemed fitting that as our 3K was not far away we should hold back on the entry until now. This little bottle went from Brussels to Copenhagen to Glasgow to London to Manchester. I love ratebeer. Ok, enough waffle. The beer. Im a sucker for a nicely coloured beer and this one really hit the spot. A thick rich purple / pink colour with a really excellent lilac head. Mad looking but utterly gorgeous. Strange initial plastic note in the aroma quickly gives way to something that I can only descibe as a freshly bathed baby. Yes there is obviously some sweet / sour blueberry and light citric Cantillon wooden funk but its more restrained and delicate than most. I couldnt help but smile the first time I took a sniff. The very second it hits your tongue you are left in no doubt that this is special. It has such amazing body for a lambic. Much fuller than normal, I guess down to the blueberries and so much smoother also but there is still that prickle around the edges reminding you what this is. Big tarty sour lambic funk balances perfectly with sweet sugary fruit. Its like an ice dance routine carried out on your tongue with effortless grace and poise. Juicy and puckery with an amazing sherbert tartness. Elegant, almost mellow and incredibly refined. Outstanding length, it just goes on and on. The finish sends you on such a journey that you almost want to wait a while before taking another sip which is a really good thing as you dont want to rush something so rare. My only slight critisism would be that I feel there is just a little too much fruit and not enough tartness showing. One day I may be lucky enough to try the 2005 vintage... Its still bloody amazing beer however. The final journey the ""Mes and Sim"" labelled bottle made was to come home with us and take pride of place in the kitchen between the Aarmonnik and the Stille Nacht Reserva. A beer of noble charm and yet another thing for which we cannot thank Jeppe enough. You seriously kick ass mate.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"
1108,"2008-01-02",4.4,"Cloudy dark red pour with a medium, creamy, pink head. Superb aroma of blueberries with the assertive funky and acidic Cantillon signature.

Aroma gets your attention - funkdelicious, sour, tart, with a nice cherry/blueberry fruitiness.

Overall it is tart and even a tad flowery with just a hint of blueberry on the finish.

Succulent, blisteringly tart aroma, great bretty notes and a decent complexity. The greatness in the flavor, though. A huge tartness is accompanied by the lightest touch of sweetness from the blueberries, and all the wonderful fruity tastes they provide. A bit puckering in the finish, with a light butteriness that makes the beer just slide through the mouth. Tastes a lot like a blue warhead.

1108,"2007-11-21",4.7,"Wow, the Blueberry aromas are blowing out of the bottle as soon as it was popped  37,5cl 2007  Beautiful deep Danish mailbox red body with a huge fine bubbled dark pink head; Incredible nose that only has one small drawback and it is a very little lack of power, there where actually more aroma when the bottle was popped (the aroma is bigger then in almost every Geuze, I just expect a lot). What there is is great, deep, complex and incredibly balanced. Danish blueberry is not a powerful aromatic berry and I guess that is why it fits so well in the Geuze, the clear soft aroma of the blueberry meat meets the sharper fruity aromas of the geuze perfectly and the earthy aroma of the small flower at the tip of the blueberry meet the barrel aroma of the Geuze perfectly. Great choice of berry, great nose; The body is perfect, a little softer and fuller then the usual very sharp body of the geuze from Cantillon, it has a great big soft small bubbled carbonation and a very clear acid bite, both a little soft from the fruity blueberry but also citric sharp, perfect; It moves smoothly into a very long finish that starts with even more blueberry aromas then in the nose, strangely enough the blueberry skin is very present here, a very mellow acid bite moves along side a little sweetness into lots of late barrel and overripe apple aromas.

1108,"2007-11-20",4.0,"Dark magnificient purple-red colour, completely opaque, slightly fading white head leaving a gentle ring. Ive had this beer 4 times this past summer. I was less enthusiast 3 times, but found it very lovely indeed the fourth. One cant deny the subtlety and agility with which the fruit is integrated. Its firm citric smell hides the blueberries nicely.Frankly, I smell some berries, but Id be hard-pressed to name blueberries at this point. Meanwhile, the usual Cantillon shouting yeastiness seems less sharp than usually. The carbonation is fully there though, clenasing and pointy. Leafy, lemony palate with tight citrus acidity and soured hay. Tart blueberries can at times be mistaken from cranberries. Too tart to be juicy. Barny ending with pencil shavings astringency. Very sharp, but it fits. A wonderful experiment. Thanks Jeppe.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

The blueberry presence is evident on the nose and the funk and fruit aromas compliment each other exquisitely, and the same can be said for the taste.  The sourness is mild for a Cantillon, with the blueberry flavors coming out upon initial taste, but also appearing in the finish along with the sour.

Nice mouthfeel, lean, with controlled carbonation; the acidity level is moderate, the fuity presence is minimal (much less than required, and with poor, moldy character); what really stands out here is the chalky astringency.A good beer, but frankly I would always take a kriek over this one.2007-10-28, vintage 2007; 37.5cl bottle, corked, 8-5-8-4-16=41Huge foamy pink head that leaves below a cloudy ruby color, with a nitro-like effect. Excellent aroma, mixing in a perfect way the delicate cellar and sweat smell of a lambic with the fruits; citrus fruits too; later, the cellar and cobwebs aroma wins. Good mouthfeel, most of the carbonation is gone with the foam; the blueberry (with a flavor that is similar to the syrup, but not as much sweet) manages to cut most harsh sides of the lambic, and the result is a very vinous drink, with a limited sourness; its quite astringent as well.

This is one both capped and corked; as I remove the cap the cork explodes off the ceiling with a violence the likes of which Ive never seen, leaving a purple blueberry stain across the elegantly finished 16-foot ceiling of my hotel room.  Yet the beer doesnt gush out; rather it waits, restrained, for my pour and then sparkles vigorously in the glass, a not-even-so-large pink head atop a gorgeous, murky, hazy rose-purple like unfiltered cherry juice.

Even as I pour Im getting a vast rush of berries in the air. Its glorious, and as I dive my nose into the glass that thick Cantillon funk comes out, for all the world like horse-stable, that lovely woody vinegar, this time accented with berries, overripe blueberries with cherry and blackberry tones.   

The flavor is perfect. Glorious sour cherries atop that unmistakable Cantillon musk. Woody lemon acidity cut by luscious fruit. Perfectly dry. I try MartinTs pairing, or the closest I can muster in my hotel room: a 70% Valrhona chocolate bar and its divine. The chocolate is merely fine, but the sip of lambic afterward with the chocolate oils still on my palate....perfection.

Plastic pool toy with more red fruit tartaric acid quality- hints of blueberry but nothing like any other blueberry beer.  More tart citric, tartaric/malic and every kind of acid flavor- low on acedic.  More plastics and phenols flavrs, very tart, harsh and astringent finish with still a bit of sweetness left.

1108,"2007-09-16",4.0,"Celebration rating #9000. Bottled. Ive waited the longest time to rate this beer - first time I tried it was in January 2006 - thank Jeppe, but now the beer has been released and the occasion is right. I try the 2005 and 2007 vintages side by side.First impression is how much color it has lost from 2005 till now. The 2005 version is pinkish-orange with a slight haze and next to no head (2), while the 2007 is deep red and very hazy wiht a huge pinkish head (4). The aroma is much more alike for the two vintages; it is acidic with notes of brettanomyces, wood, stables, and berries, I find the aroma of the 2007 vintage a bit more powerful, but this is probably because of the head retention. The flavor is somewhat different - I find the biggest difference in the tartness, where the 2005 vintage is way tarter than the 2007 - and much tarter than I remember my sample from January 2006, but besides the tartness it has notes of berries - cant really tell that it is blueberries though, wood, vinegar, hay, and barnyard - in the 2005 also some notes of fruit vinegar and stronger in the wood.

1108,"2007-08-27",4.8,"UPDATED: NOV 23, 2007 In short: Fabulous intense and original fruit lambic (blueberries).  Second only to the 3 Fonteinen Framboss.
How: Box-sent-by-Rastacouere-from-Europe tasting session
The look:  Very cloudy dark-cherry body topped by a small dark-pink head.
In long:  From the nose you wouldnt think that this is just a blueberry lambic.  Fruit salad, blackberries, raspberries, grapes and blueberries meet the typical Cantillon lambic to create an intense and complex sharp fruity acidic aroma.  Taste is like the nose and then some.  Intensity-wise the fruits are nose to nose with the Cantillon lambic which is quite a exploit in itself.  Cake maltiness is unexpected and very pleasant from a fruit Cantillon.  Even though the beer was very sharp and dry I had all along an impression of dessert ice-cream.  I originally had it at 4.9 as my ultimate fruit-lambic but after drinking the 3 Fonteinen Framboos again I bumped it down to 4.8 as my #2 fruit-lambic.  Part of the beers sent home by rastacouere while touring Europe.  Its not that I dont like you David but by sending home beers like that Im not looking forward to your return.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1108,"2007-08-26",4.7,"Big thanks go to Rastacouere for sending over a bottle of this when he was in Denmark. 2006 vintage, bottled in 2007.

Gorgeous light purple, almost rosée colored brew topped by a pinkish head that was pretty generous for Lambic, let alone a Cantillon.

That telltale barnyard funky aroma was all wet hay and dirty stables, with a very assertive fruit character that oscillated between raspberries, rhubarb and strawberries.

Carbonation was not as prickly as other fruit lambic Ive tried, and the fruit is definately in the forefront here, and its all blueberry, but the kind that just a bit unripe, when theyre sort of greenish blue. I cant tell you if they were like that when they brewed this, but it certainly worked out extremely well. The acidity seemed somehow separated from the flavor, as if every sip came with two acts, the flavorful rush of fruit flavor, then acidity, that was drying and refreshing - sounds contradictory, but it isnt - but was at a very sustained level, not as massive and brutal as some of the other fruit lambics. It was probably one of the most balanced lambics Ive ever sampled. Lord knows people have tried and failed to make good blueberry Beers, but this style seems like a perfect fit. It went down insanely well, and was an absolute orgasmic match with trappist-made chocolate-dipped blueberries I just happened to have (its the season here in Quebec). This one is a masterpiece.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"
1108,"2007-08-25",4.4,"My Bottom Line:
Radiant blueberries are propelled further by the fervent Cantillon funk into this graceful realm where equilibrium and epicureanism join forces. Summits of complex fruitiness are reached, where soaring sourness and inherent sweetness are expertly juggled to the amazement of all tastebuds.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A pink-infused sheet of foam hangs atop the deep red iridescence.
-Blueberry juice and skin morph into cherry, blackberry, and even raspberry allusions in both the nose and flavor profile.
-The soft effervescence serves the fruity display and sour intensity quite well, making the interplay quite drinkable and classy.
-This was absurdly delicious with dark chocolate-covered blueberries; a very rare perfect beer and food pairing in my experience.
-The blueberry fruitiness is actually balanced with the lambic, which is a rare occurance in Cantillon fruit lambics, where the lambic character usually reigns.
-This beers only fault is that I wont be able to get much more for myself. Bastards. ;)

1108,"2007-08-24",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 28, 2007 2007 vintage. A thin, well-retained pink and cream tinted head forms from a delicate pour. The body is a clouded, opaque color trio of crimson, pink and violet. Very pretty, though the clouded nature prevents a glow that would warrant a perfect 5 for appearance. The aroma is a restrained variety of easily identifiable Cantillon-styled funk, aromatic compositions only available in a beer from this most incredible brewery. Heavy barnyard scents and mild tartness(refrained, but certainly readily evident) lead in the aroma. Blueberries follow, both dusty and just squeezed sweetness nuances. Various berries are next, as well as moderate yeast that seems to place the beers developmental timeline(relating to bottle conditioning and funky proliferations) and at just prior to the halfway point. The nose finishes with a gently rolling wet wood note, possibly traces of a sherry wash present. Poignant though it is, this is surely a slow maturation process that has many wondrous components yet to be unleashed. Acidity is apparent long before the first confirming sip. Alcohol is completely undetectable. This nose is absolutely incredible, really everything I had hoped for. A healthy dusting of berry aromas is neither overbearing nor too shy, just beautifully executed. The flavor is stunning. Acidity is mild to moderate, devilishly integrated into woody and fruity notes so that is merely a bold complimentary addition, never any sort of distraction or focal point - in short, it does its job well, nothing more and nothing less. Sweetness is mild, bitterness is light-mild. Varied berry tastes are the center of attention foremost, then Cantillons signature funk brings a complexity rarely seen into the picture, quickly assuming the role of placeholder for subtler tastes to play off of. The finish is lightly acidic and leaves a long-lingering berry and wood combination behind, that is accentuated rather replaced by funkiness. This is just absurdly drinkable, moreso than any Cantillon Ive encountered, more refreshing than any fruit lambic yet sampled. The palate is medium bodied, airy, with velvety, thick carbonation and a light sting from acids. Congratulations Jeppe and Jean-Pierre, this is a gorgeous work of art that will no doubt only improve with time. Well see - my cellar is loaded with it. Its wonderful to know that my confidence in this brewery has rewarded me with a dividend greater than I ever imagined. Bravo!","Alabama, USA","boboski"
1108,"2007-08-23",4.5,"UPDATED: DEC 6, 2011 Red with no head. The grapefruit/horseblanket aroma leaves no doubt that this is Cantillon. I dont pick up any blueberry in the aroma. Dry and tart, with a hint of berry flavour, but it feels very similar to a geueze. Not that I would ever turn down anything geueze-like from Cantillon!

Aged one year: 2008 re-rate of the 2007. The Cantillon aroma is clearly mixed with sweet blueberry notes. The flavour also has a tiny hint of fruity sweetness. Yummy.

Fresh 2009 vintage: Now has a nice pink head. There is blueberry in the aroma - something tells me that blueberry earthyness and cantillon funk match each other perfectly. Very juicy flavour, but still with full Cantillon character. Raised the rating from 4.3 to 4.5

Is very refreshing and balalanced. Was fortunate enough to visit Cantillon with Jeppe and Michael in march 2006 where this sample from the 1. batch was served. Really looking forward to taste it again.","Søborg, DENMARK","madsberg"
1108,"2007-05-27",4.3,"2006, bottled in 2007. Thanks Jeppe for the bottle, and to my colleague Jo for being the Copenhagen mule. Shared with JSturm.

6 oz. is not enough, and this beer can stand a lot of aging. I believe this is the first Cantillon I have sampled in the year of its bottling.

Unbelievably beautiful color, richer (the beer was not fully settled yet, after only a week in the cellar) than kreik, with a pronounced purple, bluish tint. Prickly nose of fruit; blueberry and acidic cherry. Sour, with a chalky, catchy dryness in the back of the throat. Lemon flavors could meld a lot better, become sweeter - and they will.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"
1108,"2007-05-03",4.5,"UPDATED: JUL 1, 2007 From a 375mL Bottle, 2007 Vintage.  Generously shared by Chris at the 2nd Woodshop Tasting.  Mostly transparent pour of an absolutely breathtaking ruddy-blue color of stained fingertips after a full day of blueberry picking.  A lovely layer of pink fizzy head rests elegantly on top.  This is easily a 6 for appearance.  Fantastic aroma of blueberry skins, but the fruity characters arent what dominates this beer.  Lots of tart fruity characters in the nose, not distinctly blueberry other than the tannin notes, but this merely serves as a garnish for the funky sourness to shine through.  Dry, tart pinot grigio grapes, a hint of red apple, and some musky lemon rinds.  Light bodied, gently carbonated mouthfeel.  Very interesting, although not as amazing as the aroma, in my opinion.  The blueberry rinds start out the flavors, but this quickly transitions to a funky, oaky, and peppery spicy finish like a wonderful gueze.  Actually, this beer reminds me very much of what Id expect from blending a fruit lambic with a gueze - it brings out the best of both worlds without being overbearing in either dimension.  Very balanced in fruit acidity and sour, barnyard funk.  Could use a little bit more carbonation to enhance the crisp acidity of the sour fruit notes, but this is only a minor complaint about an otherwise fanastic beer.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"
1108,"2007-04-30",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 1, 2007 2007 Another big thanks to Chris Q. (cquiroga) for sampling this at the Woodshop II tasting.

Wow. Great reddish blue color, with an excellent flavor of blueberries. the balance between the fruits sweetness and the tartness of the lambic is perfect. I would love to get  a full bottle of this.","Mission Viejo, California, USA","JohnC"
1108,"2007-03-21",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 1, 2007 2007.  Astounding color.  Deep magenta with a super dark pink head, with little pieces of blueberry particles in the head.  The beer clearly absorbed the color of the blueberries in a spectacular way.  Without question, the best looking Cantillon beer Ive seen.  

 

The aroma is prehaps the most disappointing aspect of the beer.  Its just not nearly as powerful as Id like.  That being said, its still nice.  

 

The flavor is absolutely incredible.  Of all the Cantillon beers Ive tried with fruit additions (cherries, raspberries, muscats grapes, red wine grapes, apricots, cranberries) the Danish blueberries in this beer is absolutely the best fruit addition.  After the mid-palate, the blueberries become dominant.  The fruit tastes lush, authentic and phenomenal.  Also, for a Cantillon its not intensely sour like Rose De Gambrinus or Fou Foune, but instead, very well balanced.  This is an incredible fruit lambic.  Would not be suprised at all to see this in the top 50 in a few months.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Crosling"
1108,"2007-02-17",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 1, 2007 Vintage 2007.Very nice looking beer with an intens cool red color and with a fine pinkish head that leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is one and all fresh red and blue berries, there a fine citrus accents, touches of old wood and some tones of full-cream youghurt with a blueberrie topping. Taste is outstanding and very clean. It has quite a bit of body and the balance is perfect. The beer is fleshy and the sourness is well present and so mellow.
Mouthfeel is silky for the style and the power of the ripe fruits is just so elegant and tastefull. What a fantastic beer !!!
Thanks Jeppe and thanks Mikkel for bringing it over.","St Idesbald, BELGIUM","lachesis"
1108,"2007-02-13",4.6,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2012  I am told this is the 2007 version  Superb cyclamen colour with a pink rim. Looks just - inviting... Apples, cyanide, overpowering fruit aroma, like a fresh fruit drink. Milder, softer fruit taste; full-fruity. Like a sourish old sherry, mixed with cider (there IS an apple-component in this one). Actually the real acidity is probably way higher than the sour impression - its just too fruity. Thank God. The kind of berry is unidentifyable. Well bodied, acidity nothwithstanding, not becoming thinnish. SUPERB! Great! Gawdelpus, can we get this at home, please!!!  Thanks a LOT to MIkkel! 

2011 batch Superb red purple head gone in secs. Deep purple/magenta beer. 5/5  Cuberdons , sweet berries and fruitconcentrate 7/10. Dry, tart, but nowhere exaggerated; in fact it is much less than the 2007 version. Lacks also some ""lambicness"", as the barnyard, horseblanket, ... features. 8/10 Tart, slight dry-our effect, cassis in the finish. 4/5 A lot less explosive, mind-blowing than the first version. 16/20","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"
