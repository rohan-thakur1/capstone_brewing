4493,"2016-12-29",3.6,"19th December 2016Level 42 bottleshare, Santa is flying past below! Clear deep amber beer, bubbly pale cream colour head. Tart fruits on the snout. Smooth palate, semi dry with modest fine carbonation. Some sour red/brown tart fruits and tangy red wine. Sweetish dessert wine changes the direction. Very mild brett. Tartish fruity finish. Doubt this tart turn was intended but it does no harm at all here.",", Essex, ENGLAND","madmitch76"
4493,"2016-12-28",3.8,"Bottle at level 42, cheers Kenny. It pour some deep reddish - brown with a small beige head. The aroma is rich, sweet, tangy, sweet vinous character, booze, fruit cake, oak and jammy fruits. The taste is crisp, tart, tangy, vinous, jammy berry, cranberry, salty, grape skin, lemon sherbet, treacle and oak. Full body, fine carbonation and oil mouth - feel. Slick and very fruity. Good fun and rather tasty overall.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"
4493,"2016-12-24",3.7,"December 2016 - Bottle share at 1 Canada Square. Thanks Ken! As Schneider Weisse Tap X Eisbock Barrique 2015, 12%. Dark brown, translucent, foamy tan head leaves dotted lacing. Aroma is varnish, oaky, some light vinegar. Body is smooth with soft carbonation. Taste is rich with some harsh alcohol and woody notes, red wine, almost a little acidic it seemed to me. A slow drinker but tasty. Could divide opinion due to some harsh flavours. (3.7)","Richmond, Greater London, ENGLAND","The_Osprey"
4493,"2016-12-21",4.1,"38cl bottle shared in CW. Many thanks to Ken for this one. It pours a clean copper color with a minimal bubble off white head. Aroma is tart sour with notes of macerated red berries and tart cherries, almonds, wood and vanilla. Taste has more acidic tart vinegar notes, red berries, tasty cherries, vanilla, bourbon and wood. Light to medium bodied with soft carbonation. Overall, very tasty although unlikely to be intended this way","Rimini, ITALY","teorn88"

4493,"2016-11-23",2.5,"And so it came to pass that six like minded people met on the 20th day of November in the year of 2016: those six people shared twenty five fine beers. This is one of those twenty five. Two 330ml bottles of this, so we all got a decent amount. I am no Eisbock expert, but this was the cloudiest, murkiest and dirtiest one I have seen so far. Obviously the barrel ageing had more than a flavouring and aroma hand in this brew. Dry red wine notes abound and this is very unbeer like to me. Certainly not my best beer of the session.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"
4493,"2016-11-21",3.3,"Stumpy little bottle @ Richs 7k tasting. Pours murky reddish amber, thin tan head. Aroma brings a vibrant pinot noir influence. Taste continues, perhaps a little too much. Seems this beer is all about the pinot noir barrel which overshadows the usual eisbock character. Wouldve preferred a more subtle integration.","Shrewsbury, Shropshire, ENGLAND","minutemat"

4493,"2016-10-27",3.1,"Ive got a stuffed up head so Im giving it the benefit of the doubt for aroma. Appearances hazy Brown and still. Flavors surprisingly mild multi slightly tart with a little bit of the red wine barrel. Body is ok, some alcoholic warmth. Not much reason to cellar it.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"
4493,"2016-04-25",3.7,"Huge thanks to Gene (Travlr) and Donnie (GenDV138) for helping me to land this rare beer. Bottle looks awesome. Beer in the glass brownish, no head. Intense alcoholic aroma. Starts fiery-alcoholic, sharp, warming. Fruity notes of berries, grapes, light sourish. Shows sides of a good dry red wine. Finish much more balanced, less sharp, some woody-malty notes. Still warming-alcoholic, but not too intense. Warming finish. But quite drinkable for its strength. Definetly a beer to enjoy.","GERMANY","kappldav123"
