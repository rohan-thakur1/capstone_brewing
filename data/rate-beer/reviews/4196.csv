Nota prensa,,,,,,,,,,,,
Producida por la compañía Plzeñský Prazdroj qur inició la fabricación de la cerveza Master en su sucursal de Velké Popovice en 2007, con el fin de enriquecer su oferta con algo especial. Comenzó a ofrecer entonces la cerveza Master tostada de 5,2 grados de alcohol y la negra de 7 vol, según recuerda Václav Berka, maestro cervecero.

?Ser aficionado a la cerveza no significa tomarse unos diez vasos de esa bebida. Hay que tener una cultura de tomar, e ingerir uno o dos vasos como máximo, para degustar la cerveza a fondo. Nosotros decidimos ofrecerle al cliente más exigente algo totalmente nuevo que, de seguro, no había probado todavía?, dijo Berka
El maestro cervecero señaló que la cerveza Master cuenta con una abundante espuma y un sabor muy diferente a las demás clases de cerveza fabricadas por Plzeñský Prazdroj. Este se debe a que, además del lúpulo de la región de ?atec que es de calidad superior, también se utiliza una malta de Baviera y, especialmente, una especie de malta caramelizada que le da a la cerveza un sabor a caramelo.

Hasta el presente Master es distribuida sólo en barriles y es ofrecida en unas mil cervecerías de la República Checa. Su venta se acompaña de un interesante ritual.
El ritual consiste en que en la cerveza se sumerge un pequeño pedazo de acero cirujano y, debido a la reacción química que ello provoca, ante los ojos del cliente se va creando sobre la copa una abundante, consistente a la vez que fina espuma en forma de flor. La espuma es tibia mientras que la cerveza es fría y esa combinación provoca una sensación especial en el paladar, por lo que el cliente vuelve a pedir otra cerveza Master?, afirma Berka.

En 2008, un año después de que se iniciara la venta de la cerveza en las cervecerías de la República Checa, ya se han vendido unos 9000 hectolitros. El sabor especial a caramelo de la Master es quizás la razón de que casi la mitad de sus consumidores sean mujeres. En vista del creciente interés, la compañía Plzeñský Prazdroj tiene previsto iniciar también su venta en botellas, se negocia asimismo la exportación a los países del norte europeo y a España.

4196,"2008-03-27",3.8,"My Bottom Line:
Cherry-filled chocolates morph into caramel in this slick and nourishing Czech Doppelbock.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam stays atop the copper-hued dark brown.
-Fruity tartness whispers by.
-After a bunch of quaffable Bohemian Pilseners, this may appear heftier than it actually is.
-Lightly toasted maltiness completes the complex grain bill.
-Some wooden hop bitterness attempts to dry out the back end.
