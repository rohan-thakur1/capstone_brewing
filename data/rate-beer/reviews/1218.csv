1218,"2016-02-25",2.7,"Bottle shared by TJ, 2009 vintage, on 2/20/16.Dark mahogany with cocoa overtones and very light magenta-violet tints against the light. Beige head is moderate-sized and slowly fades to cover.Huge brandy-like grape character is quite intense and joined by soy sauce-like oxidation. Fruitiness for days, but also a boatload of toffee and vanilla.Dark fruits again, with sweet, sugary toffee, light barrel tannin/wood and tons of oxidation. Light carbonation could stand to be a bit more tight, for sure, but its not flat at least. As well, the barrel notes arent overdone. But its just intense, intense prune, grape, blackberry, sugary toffee-vanilla and a massive oxidation lingering. Taking the oxidation out of the equation, this stuff would still be so intensely sweet/rich and probably more alcoholic, if younger, so Im not so sure age has really hurt it....Kind of odd its so oxidized given how resistant the regular stuff is. But maybe the barrel aging contributes to the quicker oxidation.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"
