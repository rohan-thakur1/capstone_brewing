4494,"2017-05-12",3.4,"Bottle. Pours clear amber minimum white head. Aroma: caramel, candy sugar, caramel candy, really sweet aroma with some bsourness-nostalgic (extra point). Taste: caramel, hay, brown sugar, etc sweet anyway. Aroma is better than taste. Up to medium body. Not for me but not bad.","Tartu, ESTONIA","VamboladeTolly"
4494,"2016-07-23",3.3,"Good eisbock. Caramelly flavours, light sweet aroma. Limited carbonation. Tickling aftertaste. Quite ok.","GERMANY","Tjeerd"
4494,"2016-01-08",4.2,"For the beer fan with an affinity for latvian brews, this might be the holy grail. Pours dark brown to black, opaque with a thin tan head subsiding quickly. Scent is dense bock malts and a unique yeast character. Mouthfeel is medium dense bock with a light grain character. Taste is a fantastic creamy bock, delicate and mature. Very impressed with the folks at Valmiermuiza on this one.","","Cokemonkey11"

Palate was full bodied and mildly warming with medium carbonation. Flavours were malts, molasses, bread, grass and bitterness. Aftertaste was malty and bitter. Nice malty brew.","Helsinki, FINLAND","mjs"

4494,"2014-12-31",3.7,"UPDATED: JUN 25, 2015 Vertical rate #1: 500ml bottle 371/830 batch 02 BB 2014/09/06, drunk 2014/12/31 (7+:4:7:4:15=3.7+) at 8%
Lovely sweet dark fruity aroma, raisins first, then loads of prunes. Beatiful smooth body, gentle carbonation. Lovely full sweet malty body, a little bit husky and earthy. So mellow. This is a barleywine more than anything else. Finish has nice dry undergrowthy and woody bitter hops. Very well attenuated, though, not sugary. Very nice woody finish. Damn good beer - makes an Englishman think of some of the better strong beers from back home.
Horizontal rate #2: 500ml bottle 337/940 batch 03 BB 2014/09/06, drunk 2014/12/31 (7:4:7+:4:15=3.7+) at 9%
Smells a little more oxidised, a little bit more toffee, less fruits, just a hint of alcohol. Just a touch darker too. Tastes fuller. Palate fuller too. Clearly the same general beer, but brewed with a higher OG, despite what the label said (16 plato). Possibly nuttier. Again, a storming beer. If I could have the aroma of the 8% and the taste of this one, thered be an extra point available.
All in all, the better heavy fruity aroma of the 8% doesnt last for ever, and the preferable taste of the 9% is the long-lasting winning feature. I traded my 8% for Annas 9% for the last few sips.
Rerate: 500ml bottle (Valmiermuiza Shop, Riga) Batch 4, bottle 2703/5480 at 8.8% (6:4:6:4:13=3.3)
Simple bocky malts in the aroma. Rich graininess, but its quite a lagery body. Does have some esters which are nice. Full palate, smooth, and with pleasant carbonation, but whats happened to the 3.7+ beers. Seems like expansion from a 500L run to a 3000L run hasnt done the quality any favours, alas.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","FatPhil"
4494,"2014-12-24",3.5,"50cl bottle (#199/830) brought at the brewery. Pours clear caramel to copper coloured with an off-white head. Malty and caramelly aroma with dark dried fruits and hints of dark fruits, toasted malt and alcohol. Fairly sweet and caramelly with vinous notes and not much bitterness. Balanced and tasty winter warmer with carbonation on the soft side.","Tallinn, ESTONIA","visionthing"

4494,"2014-09-07",3.4,"Quite intense malty background, light roasted, some caramel, pleasant fruitiness, berries, raisins, bit alco kick. Sweetish with some hints of sourness. Would be nice, but that combo of quite high carbo, noticeable alco gives too harsh mouth experience. Might be good after year in cellar","Rīga, LATVIA","Vells"
4494,"2014-08-20",2.7,"Im pleasant surprised to see that it is not under icebock category- cause it is not. 
Pours coppery reddish with beige, soapy top, fast one, minimal lasing. Aroma- pure malt bill, ambery, also adjuncts of not barley for me. Complex with hints of acid, sugary. Taste- weird, like VM gaiais version, sour-sweet sugary, palate- syrupy, sugary astringent. Warm alco, but not pungent, no fruity esters, no hops hints to me. Above medium body, avg carbo, syrupy textue. Will try this after some time and hope for some recipe improvements.","Ogre, LATVIA","zenkis"
