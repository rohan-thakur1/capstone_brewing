3206,"2017-04-22",3.2,"Une bière blonde à laspect bien tranquille, mais avec un petit ""nuage"" de particules en suspension. Mince, peu mousseuse, et au nez où les sucres, les raisins et la paille dominent. La bouche est disons fruitée, abricots et raisins, un peu de poire, le tout dans une minceur désaltérante. Les houblons sont plus aromatiques quamers, mais ils sont bien présents. Une bière de soif sans prétention, assez ordinaire sur le fond, mais avec quand même quelques ""plus"" qui lélèvent au-dessus de la masse commerciale. Intéressante.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","lesifflebiere"

3206,"2017-02-18",3.2,"Pours a clear light golden colour with a fizzy white head, average retention and a little foamy lacing. Grainy cereal malt aromas with mild pilsner-like hops. The taste has the cereal malt as well with the hops that greener grassy, but still light. Crisp mouthfeel with a little dryness. A decent lager that goes down nicely, and less aggressive in the darker cereal grain side of things for a Helles.","Cantley, Quebec, CANADA","Metalchopz"
3206,"2017-02-10",3.7,"473ml can from the lickbow. Clear golden pour, small white head. Very clean, crisp, and refreshing. Lots of nice cereals, and pale malts, hops are quite muted, but Im not gonna hold it against it. Clean finish, low bitterness. This is a wicked go to summer lawnmower beer. A pretty wicked pale lager. Clean, crisp, and satisfying. Great job!","Sturgeon Falls, Ontario, CANADA","robinvboyer"

3206,"2017-02-05",3.8,"Can from the LCBO. Clear and bright golden body with a snow white cap of foam. Perfectly on style aroma of sweet cereal grain and herbal/grassy hops, with a hint of lemon balm. Flavour follows with an expert balance of sweet grain and peppery herbs, again a bit of lemon balm, and a clean, dry finish. Body is crisp and clean on the palate. Excellent lager.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
3206,"2017-02-05",3.2,"473ml tallboy from LCBO. Pours a fairly big foamy bubbly white head but dissipates fairly quickly to a nice average size head. Has a a clear golden appearance. Patchy lacing. Aromas of grains, grassy hops. Flavours are mostly grainy malts, hints of grassy hops again and even hints of corn. Medium retention and average mouthfeel. Nothing exciting about this one, seems to usual and normal to distinguish from other lagers of similar taste. Still not bad just was expecting a bit more.","Winchester, Ontario, CANADA","AleRider78"
3206,"2017-02-04",3.2,"Tall can. Pours a clear, golden yellow with a finger of white head. Aroma has great notes of caramel, grain, and spicy/earthy, slightly floral hops. Taste is balanced and matches the aroma. Caramel, grains, and traditional hops with a clean ending. Medium body and carbonation. Clean in the mouth. Overall clean and refreshing. Non-offensive and able to be enjoyed by most. Very safe.","Barrie, Ontario, CANADA","sudomorph"

Quiet pour with moderate carbonation and an aroma of grainy mash, sulphur, and a bready undertone.The beer is gold in colour with a firm white head and good lace.The taste is a grainy malt start with sweet notes expanding into the middle.

3206,"2017-01-06",2.6,"Can from LCBO. 30 year anniversary, eh? Id rather be able to buy their imperial stout in stores again than this retro lager but let them do their anniversary dance. Somewhere beneath the sugar water malts & hint of hops extract theres an ok breadiness & vague pilsner like crunch. Buy really yeah this is the alternative from 30 years ago. This isnt my best review; this isnt their best beer.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Freaky_tiki"
