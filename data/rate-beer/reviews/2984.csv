2984,"2007-07-22",2.4,"On tap at the brewpub. Deep gold in color (unless you are looking just at the brown paper poke) with a small white head. This has the aroma of enantiomeric alpha-D-glucose and likely has plenty of it instead of malt. It produces the desired effect of corn grain ethanol in beer form. Not great, but good kitsch.","Omaha, Nebraska, USA","SledgeJr"
2984,"2007-07-12",3.6,"On tap @ the brewpub. Dark golden coloured with a medium sized head. Malty with notes of metal, fruit, bread, pines, alcohol and grains.","Copenhagen N, DENMARK","bager"
2984,"2007-05-29",2.5,"Chicago Trip. Monday 12:30+. On tap. The funnest beer I dont like. Tried for a malt liquor and succeeded. Supposedly the clientèle gets the joke and pints are served in a paper bag. Dont quite smell the gasoline but the taste is bang on. As it warms the gasoline comes through. Orange-copper.","Stampede City, Alberta, CANADA","presario"
2984,"2007-05-08",3.3,"On tap at Piece.. served in a fitting Piece-stamped brown paper bag.  Poured a clear, deep coppery-amber with lots of rising carbonation and a well-retained cap of off-white head.  The aroma was of sweet corn and caramel with some floral accents and something akin to Candi sugar.. peppery spices in there too.  The flavor was a sweet blend of grainy corn and alcohol with what felt like some sort of Belgian-inspired spicy yeast.. warm and peppery spices and booze at the back-end.. oddly arousing.  There were waves of sweetness and spiciness on the palate.. medium-bodied and almost syrupy.. grainy throughout.  Warm finish.

2984,"2007-05-05",2.7,"Pours an amber color with a white head.  Aroma is malty with some corn.  Flavor is malty, with some corn and a clean finish.  Goes pretty well with their pizza.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","shp555"
2984,"2007-05-03",2.4,"Draught, passed around the table by TheBeerCellar2 to myself, NachlamSie, and shp555. First of all, the damned thing comes in a pint glass in a paper bag with the Piece logo on it. Im giving bonus appearance points for presentation there. Past that, its definitely a malt likka. Lots of corn, but actually in a sort of fresh way. A weird sugariness fills up the mouth and gives it very round edges. Definitely nothing to be excited about, but it blows most other malt liquor out of the water.","Walland, Tennessee, USA","tronraner"
2984,"2007-05-03",2.3,"Draught courtesy of TheBeerCellar2 during my Dark Lord excursion. Well, I wasnt too excited about this one, but really curious. The pour is darker gold than most other malt liquors Ive seen. Pretty much what I would expect from the style, but surprisingly clean given the constraints of the style that usually spell disaster. To keep this beverage this crisp and relatively balanced while using corn, no hops, and a alcohol content at 8% is pretty impressive. There are flavors of corn, a little sucrose, slightly bitter malty flavors on the back of the palate. Probably not something I would drink again because it does have all the characteristics of a style that doesnt do it for me, but I was much happier with this than the one other premium malt liquor Ive tried.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
2984,"2004-12-08",3.0,"Draught, served in a pint glass surrounded by a small brown paper bag: dark golden appearance, with a thin white creamsmells absolutely like a malt liquor: sweet corn, honey, bready, malt filled alcohol and hay.   Sweet, alcohol malt flavour with a bit of tang.  The initial flavour is much better than the other malt liquors I have experienced and makes me wonder at the amount of few adjuncts used in the creation of this one: for the flavour is an even balance of sweet sticky malt and crisp hops; I didnt think it was allowed to use noticeable hops in a malt liquoranyway, the finish does remain true to the style with a sour malt twinge and a slightly foul hop aftertastebut this is one of the better tasting and easier drink malt liquors I have come across.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"
2984,"2004-12-06",3.3,"Pours a nice straw color with good head and some lacing. Nice and clean with a good alcohol burn.   Served in a pint glass with a paper bag with a Piece logo on it.   It is a good brew that will creep up on you if you dont watch out.  Its nice when a brewer brews something like this just for fun.","Portland, Oregon, USA","HumuloneRed"
2984,"2004-11-24",3.3,"From what the bartender said, this brew had 9.5% alcohol and it tasted every bit of it.  Malt taste was pretty good, fairly light with good carbonation.  The alcohol gave it a real kick from start to finish.  Each beer was served in a pint glass with a little paper bag around it.  Ive seen it done before, but still pretty fun.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","jaymobrown"
