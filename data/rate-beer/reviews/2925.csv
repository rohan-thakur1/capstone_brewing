2925,"2016-08-05",4.3,"Bottle shared with Paul, Max and Vinny. Pours a light golden body with no head or lace. Nose is soft apple sauce and maple. Mouthfeel nails a perfect balance of acidity and apple sweetness. Notes of delicious Motts apple juice with apple pie, apple sauce, maple and strawberry.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"
2925,"2016-07-31",4.2,"Dad shared juice box at Pauls, golden orange with lighter carbonation. Notes of Apple caramel, pear and strawberry butt pie, insanely smooth and rich at the same damn time and its even more dangerous than regular Neige offerings at the 6.9 percent. La Face makes some of the best liquids on the planet! Thanks Daddy","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","PhillyCraft"
2925,"2016-03-31",4.2,"Dun beau doré ayant de fines bulles figées, qui suivent le mouvement. Un nez de pommes fraîches, cuites et épicées, avec de fins parfums floraux. Saveurs de pommes acidulées, où le poivré et le sucré sunissent pour prendre le dessus, alors que lacidité du fruit revient en force pour engourdir un peu les mâchoires. Une impression de boire la pelure de la pomme. (1771-140316)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","AlainG"
2925,"2015-12-31",3.8,"Tasting at Matts, corked bottleMeasured Final Gravity: 1.050Skewed Refractometer Reading: 14.8°BGolden color. Deep warm aroma, like the warmth of the sun, fruits, candies, light mushroom. Sweet, lean, with a hint of stewed apples, light acidity, and light final astringency.Not complex, but still an excellent cider.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","fiulijn"
2925,"2015-08-26",3.6,"375mL bottle, pours a hazy golden with a few bubbles of white head. Aroma brings out notes of toffee, caramel, and medium-high residual brown sugar. Flavour is like a low ABV ice cider, with caramel, brown sugar and toffee. It doesnt have the depth, body or complexity of an ice cider, but its quite sweet and robust nonetheless. Very nice stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
2925,"2015-08-26",3.8,"Bottle - Nice cooked apples. Clear gold. More cooked apples, much like an ice cider, but not the depth nor mouthfeel. Nice, but if it is going to taste like an ice cider, I would rather have the ice cider.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
2925,"2015-08-21",3.6,"Une bouteille de 375 ml versée dans un seul verre. Une robe dorée qui scintille. Le nez propose les assises dun cidre de glace : pommes et poires confites, sucre brun et chair de fruits acidulés. Au goût, les fruits sont modérément doux avec une juteuse acidité qui sétire en fin de gorgée. Une pointe de vinaigre me titille la gorge et cela machale un peu. Le corps est légèrement liquoreux. Un bon cidre pour amateur de cidre de glace.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"
2925,"2015-06-24",4.1,"Sampler at Mondial de la Biere in Montreal. Deep golden body, no head. Aroma of fresh Cortland and Gala apples, pears, caramel. Taste pretty much the same, plus some light apple vinegar, sweet and syrupy, but still very light. Very nice indeed!","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","bunget"

Pours still blond with no head. Aroma is of apples, sugar, acidity. Taste is of apples, sugar, alcohol, very slight acidity. Palate: Medium-full bodied. No carbonation. Overall: Nice balance. Not too sweet nor cloying or heavy. A very nice evening sipper. Id drink this pretty cold.","Québec, Quebec, CANADA","Minderbinder"
2925,"2014-08-19",4.0,"Bottle (375 ml). Courtesy of Minderbinder, thanks! Bright light caramel/golden color with little legs. Aroma is not as sweet as Ice Cider (of course its not one), but otherwise its quite similar. Theres apples and pears notes along hints of caramel. Taste is quite fruity with apples, pears, light sweetness, hints of caramel and very light acidity. Medium body. Mellow. Soft, but still really tasty. Quite drinkable too, especially compared to Ice Ciders because of much lower sweetness level. Super enjoyable. A much welcomed addition to La Face Cachée portfolio!","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
