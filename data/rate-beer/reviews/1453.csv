However, when you sip the beer, the quite sour flavor with only the tiniest hint of sweet lets your tongue down; furthermore, the medium body, thick texture, sour finish, and average carbonation are merely average and are nothing to help this beer stand out as something great.","Columbia, Missouri, USA","EtTuCthulhu"

The flavor found toasted caramel, vanilla, and maple, with a touch of medicinal and herbal hops and peppery alcohol around.. finished sharp with tacky sugars and broken-down bitterness.

1453,"2011-11-18",3.6,"12oz bottle from The Beer Depot in Ann Arbor, MI. Pours a cloudy brown colored body with a finger-width, creamy, light brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves a nice lacing. Aroma is sweet caramel and toffee-bread with some melon fruits, a touch of honey, and a light roast. A hint of dark fruit, alcohol, and herbal hops. Flavor is similar. Sweeter caramel and toffee-bread up front with a nice dark fruit, melon, and light chocolate-molasses. A light roast comes in nicely at the end that blends well with the darker malt sweetness. Finishes sweet and malty with some chocolate and bready, toasty, caramel along with light-moderate roast, a light herbal hop bitterness, some dark fruits, and a light alcohol warmth. Lengthy aftertaste following a full, smooth body and a creamy, moderate carbonation. Overall, a solid beer. Fairly sweet and somewhat sticky, but well balanced with a nice, light roast and herbal hopping. Some dark fruits and bread as well as some melon fruits. A noticeable alcohol heat, but not so much that it distracts from the flavor. A big, malty, fairly well balanced beer that I liked.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"
1453,"2011-10-04",4.0,"Thanks Emma. Originally wrote this on BA.

Appearance:
Brown with some red around the edges. Held up to the light, its absolutely crimson. No visible carbonation, and just a white ring around the edges without a real head.

Smell:
Clean and boozy, with a very rich caramel smell. Sweet and malty with some slight banana aromas.

Taste:
Sweet like molasses or brown sugar, with lots of caramel malt. Not bitter in the least. Kind of boozy (at 10% its to be expected), with an aftertaste reminiscent of chocolate and cognac.

Mouthfeel:
Low carbonation and a full body. Slightly creamy.

Drinkability:
Reasonable. I find this to be really tasty. Its very flavorful, but also high in ABV. I got the bottle for free, so I cant say much about cost, but the beer itself is great overall, as long as it doesnt cost a fortune.","Northfield, Minnesota, USA","evanlarkin"

Head retention and lacing are both OK.  Aroma is bready malt, dark fruit, toffee, and some caramel.  I think the taste is similar to the aroma, but theres the addition of some booze, molasses, and a medicinal flavor that was noticable as the beer warmed up more.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, its slick and syrupy with a good amount of carbonation.  The more I drank of this, the less I liked it.

1453,"2011-03-28",3.4,"12oz. bottle.  Aroma of moderately toasted grains, caramel, golden raisin, red apple and light, grassy hop, along with some very definite alcohol in the background.  Murky medium amber-brown color, bottle was swirled and poured, since I have tried this previously both with the sediment and without and found I slightly prefer it with.  Ivory head fades very quickly.  Flavor is rather unusual, although I suppose it does come off exactly like an American-style Alt interpretation cranked up to nearly Double Imperial caliber, with sweet, lightly doughy and bready malts, showing caramel and faint dried fruit, combining with herbal, dried, grassy hop and finishing with a medicinal, alcoholic kick, dried apple flavor and slight peppery bitterness.  Warming, prickly mouthfeel, body is full, with a moderate amount of effervescence.  Fairly interesting stuff, although I agree it has some rough edges for sure.","Suburbia, Kansas, USA","Indra"
1453,"2011-02-22",3.1,"A bit cloying has to be the first word on this beer.  However, a beer with many redeemable qualities.  Im assuming caramel malts is what is the predominant malt.  Sweetness.  Sweetness.  Then some dry characteristics on finish.  Rating suffered due to turbidity and lack of balance.  I would have no problem drinking this heavy-hitter more often if it was more affordable.

The finish has a fusel alcohol presence that is way too hot, some stone fruit and a big medicinal taste.

The aroma is malty but shows the beers alcohol strength pretty boldly in a sort of high gravity malt liquor sort of way, but has some redeeming cherry and toasty notes. The flavor isnt nearly as rough as the aroma, actually not by a long shot. There is a lot of nice fruity maltiness to the beer exhibiting cherry and plum flavors along with a nice bit of bitterness and a mild enough sweetness that makes it hard to believe that its as big a beer as it is. The alcohol is pretty perfectly concealed but the beer has a pretty commanding presence on the palate.
