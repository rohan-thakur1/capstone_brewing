This one seems more stout based in the aroma which threw me off initially. Oatmeal sticks out, a dark berry base lurks, passion fruit, roast, almond, pine in secondary - yea - that is an awesome mix. Taste follows up but the oatmeal fades out a bit, pine, citrus, candy, excellent bitterness, honey, caramel, wants to have heat but doesnt, dirt, orange peel in large chunks and lightly chewed (edit - this made me larf on the reread). Wonderful mouth feel - soft and smooth like a drier stout, lengthy managable bitterness, good stuff. This is the first 12$ beer Ive bought in a very very long time and it was totally worth it.

Hooo, yeah! Ive never had a Black IPA like this before - its really more like a (very!) hoppy RIS, than any other Black IPA Ive had. Lots of big sweet malt character melds extremely well with boozy dark fruit and massive hoppy bitterness. I think every other Black IPA Ive ever had has focused on the IPA side of things, adding a dark roasted malt note as something of an afterthought, that doesnt fundamentally change the body or overall character. This, on the other hand, is the bastard child of a heavy and sweet Imperial Baltic Porter, and a hop bomb A/IPA - and speaking of bastards, theres more than a little hint of Stones Arrogant Bastard in here, too. This is some serious shit that I highly recommend. (17/20)","CANADA","UXO"

Bella schiuma fine, aderente e lenta a scendere, colore marrone scuro, aroma con note di caffè, caramello, resina di pino, note erbacee, al palato corpo avvolgente con bassa carbonazione, caffè tostato, cioccolata amara, caramello e malti tostati, una certa salinità, finale lungo e secco e amaro.

4004,"2012-01-30",4.3,"In short: A world-class by-the-book Black IPA.  That simple.  One of the best of its kind.
How: Bottle 500ml.  Consumed 2.5 years before expiration date (so probably relatively fresh)
The look: Dark brown body topped by a medium beige head
In long: Nose is uber-hoppy with a ton of juicy citrusy hops over a nice freshly baked black cake.  Taste is.  A solid malt backbone, roasted but not too roasted, chocolaty but not too chocolaty, thick but not syrupy, no alcohol presence, only a light sweetness sensation.  And then a truckload of hops that feel fresh and vibrant.  Citrusy, resinous, grassy, leafy.  Very tasty bitterness that never feels aggressive even thought its resinous character sticks to the back of the mouth for what seems like a full minute.  Drinks like a 5% session Black IPA.  Yep, a Black IPA lover wet-dream.  Probably in on of my personal top-5 Black IPA so far, exactly like I love them, its like this brewer read my mind to make this beer, but I hope nobody can actually read my mind, that would be embarrassing, with the midgets porn and all...","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

4004,"2011-10-04",4.2,"Bottle, vin-og-gaver.dk (via Garry Solway Cider Parsons). One of my favourite beers of recent times. Fantastic black IPA, deep ruby black, with a thick and foamy head, that stayed consistent throughout. Spicy hops, pungent pine aroma that gives a great bite on the tongue and a very full aftertaste. Plenty of blackcurrant and licquorice flavours give great contrast. This is a fine complex beer whose flavour really belies the ABV.","Carlisle, Cumbria, ENGLAND","RichardW"

4004,"2011-09-23",3.9,"My Bottom Line :  
Citrusy, leafy and earthy hops swim within toasted caramel and chocolate, while berry and flower incarnations create complexity. 

Further Personal Perceptions :  
-A slice of foam laces atop the brownish mahogany. 
-The soft effervescence and relatively lean body (for such a big brew) make this an easily approachable strong ale.
-Sometimes this feels like a cousin of the great SN Bigfoot.
-The nose is mostly leafy and does not exhibit the same diversity the flavor profile can offer.
-The piney, resinous hop bitterness is levelled with the brews medium-high intensity.
-Alcohol is nearly a no show, surely concealed by the generous hoppiness.

dark clody brown, large light brown smooth head. Looks very good.
super nice sweet and fresh flowery aroma, hoppy notes, not bitter, but dry, flowery, some citrus and pine, good balance, good sweet malty base that never gets in the way of the hops, but is a canvas to paint hoppy notes on. A hoppy aroma this good is usually only found in american microbrwes.
flavor is sweet malty, flowey bitterhoppy syruppy note that reminds me of licorice, notes of caramel and choclate add complexity, but the base flavor is sort of like an IPA, only a bit darker and with some roasted notes. Perhaps the beer is very slighly too sweet for my taste, but it is very tasty and i will miss it when the bottle is soon empty.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Pinball"

Brown, huge fluffy head that resides into something messy.
This really beats black IPAs.
It is more like a hoppy bock...

Very very hoppy, with a very full malty background.
I really prefer this to the more roasted black IPAs. I think the hoppy taste goes better with the rounded malty taste than the roasted. Just my opinion.

A brew like this makes me consider if Black IPA is my new favourite style instead of the beloved Imperial Stout. However, I have only had two Black IPAs, and I will have to try a few other before deciding this for good. With this, appearance is red-brown hazy and with a delicate head. Aroma is magnificent, malty, hoppy, and a lot of cascade - how do I describe this divine drink? Some chocolate are even to be smelled among all the other stuff, and the flavor repeats the pattern from the aroma just with a little candy-like touches to the cascade, and upon that a bunch of tobacco-associations from the hops. Compared to the other Black IPA I have had, Double Black IPA from Amager Bryghus, I must say that this is a notch better as it keeps it refreshing abilities. While Double Black IPA is a kind of a citric and hoppy stout-like beer, this is more like a delicate Imperial IPA with chocolate and malts in an amount that is unheard of. Fantastic, but still, a 4.6 as it is not as good as the Black Hole Imperial Stout from Mikkeller, that I have rated 4.7.","Nysted, DENMARK","flemmingwillum"
