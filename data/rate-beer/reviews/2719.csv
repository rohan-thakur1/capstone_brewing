2719,"2013-06-19",3.7,"5 ounce pour at the Half Acre tap room. Bubbly yellow-orange, white foam. Abundant tropical fruit aroma.  Crisp, light and refreshing mouthfeel. Tastes like fresh pineapple and grassy seasoning, mild and nonassertive. Overall, its a good one if your tastebuds are cooling off.  its probably a good fit for people who avoid loud beer styles or those in the mood for easy gulpin material.","Illinois, USA","brian60625"
2719,"2013-05-31",4.2,"Pours a mostly bright gold with a white head. Nose is strong citrus and resin. Low, tropical notes as well with guava. Crisp and clean. On tasting, medium bitterness, woody simcoe and balanced. Crisp and clean, bordering on IPA in a lot of ways. Really refreshing and well made.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
2719,"2013-05-21",4.1,"Howler, pours clear straw yellow with white head. Aroma has sulfur, pine, touch catty, and grapefruit. Flavors are minerally, sulfur, then a big simcoe character, piney, hop resin, grapefruit, and finishes with hint of lime. Malt base finishes with corn and doughy toasted malt. Crisp, bit spritzy on the throat. clean fermentation. Very dry. Really cool hoppy lager. Like a pilsner hopped with simcoe.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
2719,"2013-05-21",3.8,"This one is excellent. It is called a hoppy lager but is similar to an ipa.  Pours light yellow and goes down really smooth.

2719,"2013-05-19",3.8,"On tap at Half Acre, Golden pour, thin white head. Aroma of citrus hops, taste is lots of citrus, nice hop presence, dry finish.","Farmington, Minnesota, USA","XmnwildX12"
2719,"2013-05-18",3.5,"Draft on tap at the tap room (Chicago, IL). Pours a richly golden amber hue, some decent haze but near transparent. Good golden glow, touches of orange hit. A frothy whitish head atop dies to a good layer, laces ok. Aromas are a nice interesting bitter hop profile, preaching citrusy grapefruit, florals, some melon. Bready and cereal malts, pretty clean. The American hop profile does the lifting here. A touch of tropical fruit, citrus, florals. Initial is lighter end of the fold, a touch of girth in the middle. Firm resiny hops, some tropical elements, grapefruit and a gentle spiciness. Touches of bready and grainy malt. Middle is a touch more sweet, but more of a grainy/bready slant. American hops are creative, a bit of sweet melon and fruit as we round the corner. Tasty but a bit sweet back there. Some soapiness, florals, and fruit as we round the corner. Decent bitter hops, earth as we finish up, some cereal and bready grainy malts. A simple beer displays a tasty and more interesting fruity hop profile here. Solid Lager that offers that unique quality.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
2719,"2013-05-15",3.7,"Another crisp, dry Half Acre brew. In my mind, ""crisp and dry"" has become what they are all about. You could go more upscale and say ""clean and refreshingly bitter"". Whatever. Having a variety of 4-6% abv beers on tap that all have personalities of their own is awesome.

Stargrazer tastes like four percent abv, not six. Very drinkable in large amounts; Ive put away a 20oz pour in five minutes multiple times. Hey, I was thirsty. Multiple times.

Its more mild overall than the Lager, with less dry hop taste and less distinct malt taste than Pony. Its like a starter lager for people new to craft beer, which is how Ive been using it with my work friends -- who loved how dry and thirst-quenching it was. I prefer the Lager for October-April drinking, Pony for warmer weather. That said, Ive had A LOT of this in two weeks, so I guess I like it, too.

Very high overall rating because, though this brew doesnt excel in one particular category, it just works.","Illinois, USA","gregdafdxguy"
2719,"2013-05-11",3.9,"13oz pour at half acre. Musty tangerine and pineapple and light yeast aroma with pale grain husks throughout. Really liked the citrus aspects showcased while an apparent grassiness also exist amongst the aformentioned... Citrus tangerine hoppy flavor upfront, crisp and clean, while quickly followed up by more of a mildly sweet grain backing and finishing off with a light bitterness. More hops upfront with more of sweet grain lagery finish. Fresh and clean with an easy going lighter than medium body with a crisp carbonation. Would def have again in larger quantity.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","pantanap"
2719,"2013-05-04",3.8,"Growler from the Half Acre tap room.  Nice, hazed orange pour with a nice styrofoam white head.  Aroma of bright, herbal hops. Some orange and tangerine.  Flavor is crisp, refreshing.  Nice and delicious.  Light bodied, fresh and clean finish.  That is just awesome.","Lemont, Illinois, USA","HonkeyBra"
