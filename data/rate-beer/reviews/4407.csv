4407,"2016-09-06",3.0,"On tap @ Stone Corral. Very dark brown in color with a khaki head. Very assertive roast, some burnt toast, earthy hops, and caramel. Sort of a sweet black licorice candy thing, too. Maybe some green apple in there. Theres something off about it in general, unfortunately. Not a big fan.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

Big aroma of chocolate and toasted caramel malts with a low, earthy hop profile. The body is medium or better.

4407,"2016-04-05",4.2,"Smells of roasted barley a bit nutty bitter chocolate and finishes with a dark coffee. Really nice smooth silky black color. Taste starts with the roasted barley quickly changing to ccoo nibs and dark roasted coffee on the finish. Fullish body with spry carbonation which tend to linger on the tougue which I enjoyed very much. Great schwarzbier but only tried a couple so not sure if I have tried enough to say its the best but great brew reguardless.","milton, Vermont, USA","polo_marco"

4407,"2015-10-09",3.5,"Location: 22 oz bottle from Winooski Beverage, 10/9/15


Aroma: The aroma is grains and breads, somewhat roasty, earthy, and light chocolate

Appearance: Pours a dark brown color with bubbly brown head and some drippy lacework

Flavor: It tastes along the same lines, light sweet, light roast, and some light bitterness

Palate: The body is light-medium, decent mouthfeel, lively carbonation, and a mid-dry close

Overall Impression: 
Pretty solid beer.  Nothing amazing or special going on here, just a solid, decently flavorful, relatively drinkable offering.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
4407,"2015-09-28",3.6,"22oz bottle picked up while traveling in VT. Pours black with a tan head. Big roasted malt notes, slightly sweet and slightly burnt. Hints of coffee and chocolate. Bitter with a dry finish. Pretty good.",", Massachusetts, USA","BroSpud"
4407,"2015-09-13",3.5,"This was poured into a pilsener glass.
The appearance was a dark brown close to black color with a two finger off white to almost tan rocky head that dissipated within less than about thirty seconds. Barely any lacing stuck, it all slid into the beer.
The smell started off with some light dark fruits rolling into subtle roasty hints of coffee and a light cocoa.
The taste takes the previously mentioned flavors to combine sweet and nicely. Roastiness and bitterness of the coffee slides in to blend nicely. The aftertaste is semi-sweet, somewhat roasty and has a nice stickiness. The finish is quick and somewhat dry.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a somewhat sweet sticky sessionability to it. Carbonation seems to hit a tad harder than other schwarzbiers Ive had.
Overall, for the most part, its a good schwarzbier, carbonation might hit a bit harder than others of its style, but it mainly hits all of the points of the style. Maybe, it could have some breadiness in the flavor, that could help maybe a little bit.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
4407,"2015-08-30",3.2,"650 ml bottle purchased at Hunger Mountain Co Op. Thin lasting off white head sitting on top of dark brown/ somewhat black liquid. Aroma is light barley, weak roasted grains, hint of chocolate. 
Flavor has weak chocolate, notes of roasted grain, caramel. Notes of coca powder. Dry texture. The bitterness is very light and maybe a hint of coffee bean. I sure this fairs better on cask or draft because what is in front of me is lacking. Not as robust as others Ive sampled in this style. Drinkable just very mild overall.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
