NOSE : strong tart and burned caramel aromas. They escalate to brownie like and nutella. It has a sweet cheese with raisins and vanilla like aromas. While strongly shaken it reveals coffee and mountain honey notes.

Aftertaste is bitter chocolate and mud like. Flavors are rich with sweet molasses or maple syrup. Strong burned caramel and black chocolate. Fruits aromas are of dried raisins, plums and figs.

Deep brown-red colour, big off-white head with good retention and light lacing left on the glass.
Aroma is of sour red grapes, is this one infected too? I dont get any of the typical dubbel aromas.
Taste is also sour. I had troubles drinking this one, but after it warmed up, the sourness seems to retreat and both on the aroma and on the taste some roasted malts and light chocolate were traceable.
Medium bodied, good carbonation.

Interesting taste, malts dominate, semi-sweet like the aroma but with more coffee and chocolate than the toffee mentioned earlier. Not too sure where the alcohol is being hidden because this isnt a thick or heavy beer. It doesnt even seem to appear as the mouth dries and the hop content leaves a slightly bitter dark chocolate aftertaste in the mouth.

In long: Nose mixes fruits (berries and such) and a nutty character (chestnut mainly).  Body is very lively.  The refreshing fruity flavours of berries, light strawberries and even strawberries (!?) are smoothen down by creamy nutty flavours of peanuts, almonds and such.  Surprisingly refreshing with a nice raspberry/strawberry tartness.  Typical lively Belgian carbonation.  A very good beer but although nothing here that re-invents the wheel.
