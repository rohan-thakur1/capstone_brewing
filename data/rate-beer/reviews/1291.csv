1291,"2010-09-03",4.2,"Cask handpull, The Marble Arch, Manchester. Orange amber, slim white collar. Ripe, perfumed aroma falling off the branches with exotic pollen, red apple and jungle fruit. Shit, thats a 9. Now THIS is much more like it; beautiful stewed tea, ganja and pineapple; hints of countering biscuit and nuttiness. Generous mouthfeel thick with perfumed hop and malt-  big bitterness, but so well cushioned by tropical hop, mango and tomato vine. Thick like milkshake thick. Oh dear. Wow. Not sampled many UK cask beers this..dripping with hop. Its really is like sucking a hop. Or a bar of soap. In a good way. Almost out of the very top, top drawer.","NUNEATON, Warwickshire, ENGLAND","DruncanVeasey"

1291,"2010-05-30",4.6,"Tried this at the marble arch yesterday...as soon as i was handed this pint i realised id made a mistake....Its all well and good waiting for the doors to open at 12 like a proper alcy but this was first off and pretty warm...ah well i thought as i wandered back to my table thisll be the tester...will it taste good after who knows how long in the lines? I gave it a sniff and thought holy crap I gave it a taste and thought by jingos this is fantastic! yes ridiculously warm but easily still one of the best pints ive had all year! Drank it in about 15 minutes then switched to dobber...aarrgghh another warm one! am i the only person in this bar drinking the strong stuff at midday...apparently so...ahh well good times! I suppose i should be harsh in the rating given that it was warm but i say bollocks to that! After the dobber i popped round to 57 Thomas and had one on stillage...alright tasted two different ways in one day...tell you what my afternoon went fast after those three pints!","Bakewell, Derbyshire, ENGLAND","kempicus"
