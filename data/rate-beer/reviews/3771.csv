Strange brew to be honest, poured a lively dark brown with an off-white cap. Malty aroma with a fruity ester or two: I tried to find banana and vanilla (my go too Weiss bier aromas) but failed to find them, the maltiness being a little overpowering in the nose, plum and coffee notes as the beer warmed a little. The taste was also dark malt first in dominance with the wheat way back in the distance. The plums and coffee smells that arrived late in the nose come through in the taste a little stronger to add an extra dimension to the flavour.

3771,"2015-06-14",4.2,"Odkapslowanie kończy się wystrzałem jak z szampana, choć korka pod kapslem nie ma, nie ma też mowy o gaszingu (poza świetnym dymkiem wydobywającym się spod kapsla). Po przelaniu do szkła tworzy się beżowa, sycząca piana, średnio pęcherzykowa, dość szybko opadająca do obrączki. Barwa ciemno brązowa, mętna, nieprzejrzysta. W aromacie faktycznie doszukać się można nut porterowych - czekolada, kawa zbożowa, prażone ziarno, karmel, ale także piwa pszenicznego czy dunkela - delikatna kwaskowość pszeniczna, melanoidyny w postaci chleba razowego, suszone śliwki, rodzynki a nawet banan i zioła. Jest więc bogato i wielopłaszczyznowo. W smaku dzieje się dokładnie to samo - jest wyrazistość porteru i łagodność weizena, lekka słodycz kandyzowanych owoców, trufli i toffi miesza się z orzeźwiającą kwaskowatością skórki od chleba, pikantnością, winem domowym z głogu. Goryczka gorzkiej czekolady, pestek wiśni i przypraw jest znakomitą choć subtelną kontrą. W afterteasie rozgrzewający likier kakaowy i mus jabłkowy oraz odrobina pieprzu. Nagazowanie niewysokie, drobne, odczucie w ustach dość pełne. 
Niesamowita mieszanka dwóch zupełnie innych smaków i aromatów w przedziwny sposób współgra tu ze sobą tworząc świetnie skomponowany i ułożony trunek. Generalnie profil jest deserowy, ale dzięki orzeźwiającym cechom piw pszenicznych jest zdumiewająco pijalne.

3771,"2015-03-09",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Cherries, cloves and roasted cereals move into fruity acidity in this Weizenbock-like creation.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam tops the reddish brown.
-The wheat beer yeast is much more apparent than the Porter-like grain bill.
-Drinkability is still high.
-While this is a pleasant experiment, I would still go back to their regular offerings when looking for something in a Weissbierbrauerei portfolio.

3771,"2014-10-15",4.1,"Transfer from BA review on 4-13-14-

 Poured from bottle into a pint glass

 Appearance  The beer pours a nice dark brown color with a one finger head of a dark cream color. The head has a great level of retention, slowly fading to leave a ton of foamy lace on the sides of the glass.

 Smell  The aroma of the beer is strongest of a dark fruit smell s of a raisin, fig, and cherry nature mixed with plenty of chocolate aromas. Other fruity aromas of a lighter fruit nature are there as well with aromas of banana, pineapple, and papaya are there as well. These are mixed with a bit of a wheaty bread aroma and some booze, which combined with the other aromas to give a rather chocolate wheat fruitcake like smell. 

 Taste  The taste begins a rather decent showing for some darker fruit tastes with good dose of a wheat bread taste. Along with these flavors is a little bit of chocolate and a slight yeasty taste. As the flavor advances the wheat flavors increase in intensity with them being accompanied by an increase in the yeasty flavors as well. The chocolate flavors lose ground as the taste advances as darker fruit flavors of fig and raisin come to the tongue. Along with the increase in darker fruits, there is also a big development of some banana and lighter fruit flavors of a pineapple and papaya nature. With some light boozy flavors as well as a little bit of an earthy and hay like hop flavor coming to the tongue at the very end of the taste, one is left with a nice and smooth darker fruited wheat flavor to linger on the tongue..

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the higher side. The big carbonation is great for the weizen style of the brew, all while the thicker feel is rather nice for the darker flavors of the brew. Overall, it was very nicely done.

 Overall  This was a tasty and very easy drinking weizen. It has a nice blend of fruits, wheat and yeast to make for a nice clean and smooth drinking brew. A good one to try if you get the chance.","","Darkmagus82"

Nose is heavily phenolic, bubblegum pushing past clove and pairing with spicy notes, red berries -- an intense and pretty classic hot-fermented weizen character. Pours deep brown, opaque and yeasty with amber peaking out around the sides and bottom, aggressive carbonation, super-dense and rocky tan head. Taste semi-dry with strong tang, very mellow light body, soft and smooth and swirling. Doesnt seem nearly as effervescent in the mouth (actually closer to flat!  Shocking!), but the lips are sticky enough. Again, strong phenolic character, this time mingling and merging with strong (but not boozy) heat; the expected Porter notes (chocolate, light roast, bitterness) are faint, and its a bit more like a Brown Porter at that. Those red berries are very jammy, and my perceived sweet tooth is very interested. Really like the spice and theres some good malt development under the yeast. Insignificant hops. Honestly, I dont care if they call it a Porter-Weisse or a Weizenbock or whatever, I just wish all Dunkelweizen were like this, or at least used it as their base reference.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

Indeed a boldish combination, at least by denomination. Pours a murky but light hazelnut brown.

3771,"2014-01-24",4.0,"The best kind of experiments are those that seem wildly wrong at first, but end up being oh(!) so good. Luckily, Meine Porter Weisse falls into this category. Although its more porter than weisse--the beer has a dark mahogany, almost black shade and a porters familiar coffee and chocolate notes and flavors--hints of clove certify its weissbier half. The result is hearty yet smooth beer that belies its alcohol percentage and offers a new twist on the standard English porter.","","Eamber"

3771,"2014-01-16",4.4,"Reading the scientific details of this experiment is an interesting thing and will wake your interest, but you know nothing until youve tasted the astonishing result!

Combining the best of Schneiders wheat beer yin and some serious porter yang created something that is better than just the sum of both. 

Its a nearly black and slightly cloudly beer with a lively carbonation. Youll notice the typical chocolate and coffee aromas of a good porter at the same time youll have some subtle banana flavor on your nose.

The taste comes in waves of as if the two beer styles did not mix, but are filled into the bottle in layers. First youll notice the chocolate, caramel malt and coffee flavors of the porter. The next wave is even more refreshing and brings the flavors of hops and banana which are so typical for Schneiders beers. The finish is easy and rounds up the refreshing taste of the beer. Its actually so easy that after two of them youll be surprised by the alcohol content (7%) :)

No doubt this beer has been masterfully crafted and the result. Get this beer while it lasts (its limited!) to bridge the time gap until the next Tap X experiments outcome :).","Bavaria, GERMANY","bexxx"
3771,"2014-01-07",4.8,"From the English porter comes the dark brown, almost blackish color and also the mild roasting flavors, which remind me a bit of dark chocolate. Then the Bavarian Hefeweizen comes in with its fruity, spicy hints of raisins and nuts! A VERY SMOOTH, well-balanced beer with a VERY LIGHT, subtile aroma of hops leaves a dry- yet plesant mouthfeel. THIS BEER IS VERY DANGEROUS AS IT GOES DOWN SO, SO SMOOTH! I really couldnt notice the alcohol (7%) until it was already too late...Oh well, the night was pretty fun- as Im sure you could imagine!

They recommend pairing TAPX Meine Porter Weisse pairs with: hearty meats, all kinds of roasts, strong cheeses i.e. Gorgonzola, blue mold cheese, and/or desserts with hues of vanilla or nuts.

I havent tried any of those pairings yet but Im definitely looking forward to it! THIS BEER IS VERY LIMITED EDITION!!! So, if you are able to find one, then lucky you! 

Cheers!","GERMANY","Oktobrfestgirl"
