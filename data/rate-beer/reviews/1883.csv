1883,"2015-02-21",3.3,"*Old rating, best before 10.10.11.  Malzig-würziges Bier. Leicht süßlich und sehr süffig. Schöne Malzkomponenten, die den Alkohol verstecken. Eine passende leichte Herbe kommt hinzu, die mit dem Malz und der Süße gut harmoniert, Ein Hauch Alkohol ist zu schmecken. Lecker.","Wuppertal, GERMANY","Erzengel"
1883,"2014-02-10",3.2,"Ins Glas ergießt sich ein goldgelbes Bier mit geringer Schaumkrone. Geruch malzig, würzig, grasig, leicht alkoholisch. Geschmack sehr malzig, würzig, leicht süß alkoholisch.","P´Castle, GERMANY","Beerhunter111"
1883,"2013-04-29",3.4,"Ein gar nicht mal so schlechter Bock, der locker von der Hand. Malz dominiert mit einigen Nussaromen und ehe man sich versieht, hat man eine Flasche vernichtet, da der Alkohol hier nur in Nuancen zu schmecken ist. Gefaehrlich dazu, da man sich waehnt, man wuerde nur ein simples Dunkel trinken. Hat durchaus Aehnlichkeiten mit einem Weltenburger Barock Dunkel. Gut, einfach gut.","Wanne-Eickel, GERMANY","MichaelAwesome"
1883,"2013-04-29",3.2,"Six-pack. Clear light brown colour with steady head and medium to smooth body. Nose of strong malt. Taste of dark grains, strong alcohol, dark nuts, brown bread, cloves and light roast. Nice and easy to drink, quite quaffable but you must like malty beers to enjoy this one.","Reutlingen, GERMANY","McTapps"

1883,"2012-06-15",2.4,"Bottle by 09.09.12.  Nose is sweet and grainy, light bread crust and toffee.  Dulled orange body with a blink-and-you-miss it head.  Crisp medium body is metallic with some booze showing, low bitterness and not too sweet.  Warms the throat slightly, feeds the bacteria around the teeth, has some honey and earth.","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
1883,"2012-02-01",3.8,"Getreidiger Beginn, dezente Malznoten, untertönige Süße. Deutlich intensiver im Mittelteil, hier vereinen sich Malz und Getreidigkeit zu einer führenden Würze. So bleibt das Bier einige Zeit, rund, harmonisch, zum Ende steigt die Bitterkeit geringfügig. Gut! 8/12/11/12/12/12","Köln (Cologne), GERMANY","Koelschtrinker"

1883,"2011-06-09",3.4,"Lovely color, amber/brown, with ample carbonation and a dense initial head. Prototypical maibock aroma, earthy with molasses and leafy hops, slightly spicy - very fresh and very good. Flavor is so German, so natural, so earthy. Slight-to-moderate bitterness (leafy, organic, bitter greens) with some saltiness. Medium sweetness (molasses, iron). Palate almost to spritzy, but not quite. Defines Maibock to me.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

1883,"2011-04-26",3.5,"Tried to get this beer in Saxony without succes, finally found it in a Norma-market in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The bottle looks really good, beer in the glass also, deep golden, nice head. Spicy-grasy aroma. Starts intense spicy, some wheaty-grasy notes, soft touch of lemon. Finish well balanced, not as intense spicy as the beginning, very drinkable. Really good maibock!","GERMANY","kappldav123"
1883,"2011-04-18",3.6,"bottle from my local Norma supermarket. Accoding to what kappldav123 found out at the brewery, this Maibock is brewed to a different recipe than their regular Maibock. So this is not Einsiedler Maibock. It pours a clear, deep, deep golden colour with a orange glow, mid-sized off-white head. Aroma of caramel. Very full-bodied, intensive malty base with some lemony hops, hints of citrus fruit, as well as caramel and a touch of alcohol. Smooth carbonation, dangerously drinkable!","Down South, GERMANY","Quack-Duck"
