1981,"2014-08-21",3.8,"Transfer from BA review on 1-3-13-
 Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

 Appearance  Served a deep-deep brown nearly pitch black brew with a one finger cream colored head. The head had a decent retention fading over time to give a nice level of lacing on the sides of the glass.

 Smell- The aroma was an odd mix of roasted, sweet and slightly sea like smells. The sweeter smells were of a chocolate and caramel nature with the sea like smells being of a saltwater beach like aroma. While saltwater like, it was not unpleasant and it actually melded quite well with the sweet and roasted smells.

 Taste  The taste begins as most other stouts do, with a roasted malt and slightly sweet taste. The roasted flavors were a mix of toasted barely and some dark chocolate with the sweet being largely of a caramel nature. As the taste advanced however the roasted flavors begin to dwindle some with the sweet increasing slightly as a molasses and vanilla flavor come to the tongue. While this is occurring, there is also a more salty flavor developing in the taste. While light at first it gets stronger and stronger as the taste advances. In the end the sweet and salty tastes along with a nice roasted malt flavor have control over the tongue and leave a rather salty roasted flavor to linger on the tongue.

 Mouthfeel- The body of the brew was on the average side in terms of creaminess (maybe a little above) with a carbonation level that was average as well. Overall though I think the blend of medium body and medium carbonation suited the somewhat opposing (at least in feel) sweet and salty aspects of the brew against the roast flavors of the brew quite well.

 Overall- A rather tasty stout. Although it is not something I would take again and again due to the slightly more salty nature in the taste, it is a rather unique and different flavor to try. This is one I think people should experience I they get a chance.","","Darkmagus82"

1981,"2014-01-17",3.0,"Reviewed from notes. Consumed on 11/12/13.
She pours a nice brown and leaves the same colored body very close to black, one finger tan head that dies within about thirty seconds, lacing is clingy and starts to spider web about a minute
The smell has some dark malts, light cocoa and coffee-ish aromas play in the background.
The taste has some bitter yet malty, and slightly salty, thick malty and cocoa-like aftertaste, dry finish.
On the palate, she sits about a medium sort of body, only sessionable enough any English Stout can be - so not really, carbonation is fairly smooth and doesnt pound me as some English Stouts have in the past, I like it for the most part.
Overall, I havent had too many oyster stouts in my life time, and I say it again as I say for every oyster stout Ive had, ""wheres the oyster?"" Maybe I just dont get these things and am expecting too much as far as an oyster stout should go, Ill keep trying them and still would have this one again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
1981,"2014-01-13",3.7,"Can, courtesy of JStax  thanks! Pours a dark brown color with a thick ring of tan head. Rich nose of chocolate and roast. Its really quite decadent. Heavy roast and a dry bitterness take over in the taste. Coffee grounds come to mind, as well as bittersweet chocolate / bakers cocoa. A little sweetness before the dry bitter comes through, but this packs a decent punch. Smokey and ashes. Rather robust in fact. Good stuff.","Meridian, Idaho, USA","jake65"
1981,"2014-01-08",4.0,"12 ounce can from Hayduke that we had together over facebook chat. This beer pours like a cola. It has a nice big lighter shade of tan head. Carbonation slowly rises up the side of the glass. Thick lacing remains from where the head fell. Not sure what I smell here but it is interesting that there are no roasted notes. However, that is tasted. Chocolate leads along with vanilla. Something like rum in a chocolate covered candy. Just a hint of hops in the back. They bring bitterness and citrus but, again, just a bit. Perhaps some oyster in the finish. Also, the finish got a little powdery in the feel. This is a really easy beer to drink and at 7.9% ABV is dangerous!","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
1981,"2014-01-06",4.3,"Can from Sugaya, I just wrote a long detailed review only to have it get swallowed into a black hole... Simply put this beer is amazing, my first oyster stout which I had sitting in my fridge for months and simply put knocked my socks of. The kicker is it wasnt even that expensive. It has a dark cola pour with reddish tints which in the glass turns a dark opaque black with a thick tan head that quickly vanished but left behind good lacing. The mouthfeel is full & creamy while the nose has that indefinable port like aroma I associate with top quality stouts-someday I will pin that flavor down but today is not that day. The taste is cacao nibs, dark chocolate, roast coffee with a fantastic after taste of bitter chocolate that lingers.

Aroma is a combo of mostly sweet malt, a lighter bit of roast, and a hint of apple skin sharpness... possibly acetaldehyde? Very mild soy-sauce character with some warmth, almost brine-like in a way. Initial taste is some char, dark chocolate malts, roasted, and quite smoky. A brine aftertaste arises, a bit salty and seasoned like a musty sea deck - sounds off-putting, but it actually paired quite well with the smokiness of the beer. The liquid smoke flavor hung around until the very end, and an almost chipotle-like spice came out... Different, but pretty tasty. Medium-thick bodied, low carbonation.

Faint earthy & saltiness which must be the oysters - ironic that a shellfish from the ocean would supply earthiness. Medium to full bodied with faint alcohol.

Dark fruit comes in midway along with a little brine but you really have to dig for it. Vanilla comes in towards the finish along with a quite high slightly biting bitterness. The finish is fairly sticky with a breath of alcohol.

Overall, a nice oyster stout that is stronger than some of the others I have had. The oyster shells lend a bit of a unique character and a extra element to a really good stout.","Johnson City, Tennessee, USA","rangerred"

1981,"2012-12-31",3.8,"Can.  This is a rich and smooth stout with lots of roast and hop bitterness.  I looks great in a class with a nice head and deep black color.  The issue here is taste.  The oyster element - a faint brinyness only comes in the nose for me and the finish is slightly tinny.  Would be a 4+ if they sort that issue out.","Maputo, MOZAMBIQUE","Imaena"

The aroma was very mild with a briny chocolate scent. The beer had a good thicker body and a mild dark chocolate flavor. There was a slightly dry taste and some nice dark chocolate bitterness in the middle. The finish became slightly metallic and on the dry side with a bit of a salty brininess. Wish they would have brewed it with the oysters as well as the shells.","Florida, USA","gpekar"

1981,"2012-12-27",3.5,"On tap at Junlge Jims, Eastgate, OH. 

Pours very dark brown with a thin light  brown head. Aroma is surprisingly floral, earthy, some chocolate. It may be power of suggestion, but I also smell what seems to be some saltiness, like sea water. Taste is pretty mild, somewhat sweet; dark chocolate, floral, some smoke. There is again this odd sort of mineral quality, a bit saltwater like. Slick, oily mouth feel. Overall I found this mineral/salt quality odd but not necessarily unpleasant. However, I very much enjoyed the floral character of this beer. I also was a bit surprised to find that the shells only were used to make this beer, not the oyster meat. This would account for some of the mineral taste and the lack of a meatiness. I would drink this again, even for some of its peculiarities.","Highland Heights, Kentucky, USA","Chuckaduck"

12 oz can poured into a pint glass.

A: Pours a very dark red color. Its not very opaque considering its a nearly 8% stout. It also seems to feature somewhat strong carbonation if I look closely in the glass. The head is a weak looking one finger mocha color with low retention.

S: Seems to be a sweet stout, with primarily chocolate, hazelnut, and faint vanilla. The oysters come through quite well, as a sort of salty, mineraly aroma. Could be a bit less metallic, but thats just nitpicking.

T: Surprisingly, the flavor is sitting on the opposite end of the stout spectrum of the aroma, with tons of roasted malts, lactose cream, and coffee. It comes across as smoky at times, too. After the initial finish, the mineral profile comes through. The flavor has a bit too much metallic presence to be great, especially on the aftertaste. Really, it just doesnt work for me.

M: Tingly and astringent. It seems dry at first, but after a while, the charred, metallic aftertastes seemingly introduces a syrupy quality to the texture that Im not a fan of.

O: I like oysters. I love stouts. Sadly, I dont love this; even like is too strong of a word here. Just too disjointed for my tastes.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"
1981,"2012-12-27",3.8,"12 ounce can, canned on 11/19/12 (printed on bottom of can).  Served in a pint glass, the beer pours dark brown/black with a half inch tan head.  Head retention and lacing are both decent enough.  The brew smells like chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, and some oyster shell/brine.  I think the taste is pretty much just like the aroma, but the oyster shell/brine salty flavor is stronger in comparison.  Mouthfeel/body is medium, its a bit coating with a moderate amount of carbonation.  I think its a good overall brew, definitely worth a try if youve never had it before.  $8.99 a 4-pack.","Reynoldsburg, Ohio, USA","bluejacket74"

1981,"2012-12-24",3.4,"12 ounce can - $2.99 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a black body with a frothed, light tan-hued head. A little spittle of lace on the way down.

Smell: Soundly malty with notes of chocolate, roasted malt, and even a nice, nutty oat scent, with a far-off, skanky whiff of the sea.

Taste: Roast, bakers chocolate, caramel and an additional pinch of table sugar. Touch of nutty oats. Fairly sweet, really. Light dark fruitiness. Restrained hop character with enough bitterness to edge out the sweetness somewhat. A little bit of mineral, some saltiness from the brine quality. Roasty, chocolaty, lightly briny finish with still more of that sweetness.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium-light carbonation.

Overall: Shell done, 21st Amendment Brewery.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

1981,"2012-12-23",3.1,"12 ounce can from Whole Foods Market Charlottesville. Pours a clear dark brown color with a large foamy tan head. Good head retention. Aroma of intense chocolate ice cream, a mild bit of roast followed by a moderately briny finish. The taste is chocolate, roasted malts. a mild salty note and a hoppy finish. Not bad, but I think that the oysters meld better with a dry stout, and I find this one too sweet, and Im kinda disappointed they arent whole oysters.

Chocolate malt lends a sweetness that I think is a weird combo with the oyster. Light bit of alcohol.

1981,"2012-12-15",3.5,"Canned on November 19, 2012.
Appearance: The body is pitch black even through the edges with a thin tan head with poor retention. Minimal lacing and a light coating with a foamy ring.
Aroma: The aroma is restrained here, at first I could only smell a light dryness of brine, but theres sweet cocoa beneath. This is too bland to really be offensive or loved.
Taste: The intro and mid-taste is a bit bland with just some hints of cocoa, being a tad dry, the end introduces dark chocolate and a very light roasted profile on the finish with a clean bitterness balancing everything out.
Palate: Medium to thick with a syrupy texture and a light fizz.
Overall: This is a good stout that has good balance and nice subtle notes of flavor throughout. I enjoy this but I wouldnt buy it again, I do think its much better than my rating indicates though.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Taste with light chocolate, light smoke, relatively dry and quite smooth, can tell there are oats in here, smooth silken medium body and just a hint of them in the finish.  Touch of ash/acrid roast but for the most part this comes off quite repeatable, alcohol feels more like 4.8-5% rather than the whopping 7.9% the can suggests.  Light, nimble bitterness with timid support from the aroma/flavor hops.
