Slightly sour note of pineapple and warm yeasty bread reminded me of a very weak Belhaven 90/ aroma. Silky milk like texture to the mouthfeel and poor lacing. Dark malt complex gives fruit notes of damsons, dates and plump raisins. Again a weak Belhaven 90/ comes to mind. There is no treacle or toffee notes in this but a very slight roast malt note comes through. Hint of hops evident but is rather fleeting in the aftertaste as fruit note returns in the sweet malty finish with sultanas and vinous cask notes. Starts to run out of steam before the finishing line though. Would be interesting to see what this would be like if the ABV was given the full fat factor?
