This is an immensely flavorful, with a huge, jammy fruit flavor that is balanced nicely by the tangy tartness from the wild beer and a powerful, oaky dryness that lingers the whole way through.

3163,"2016-10-27",4.0,"From notes. Enjoyed at Corbets house during a tasting on October 24. 750 mL bottle. The pour is a dark purple ruby color with a lighter pink ring of head and no lace as it falls down. The aroma is very jammy. There is a ton of fruit happening that I like. Boysenberry and blackberry jump out, there is a light oaky funk, and a great tart sourness to it. The flavor is a little funkier than I would like, but the sour fruits are really controlling and nice. They get a little sweet on the finish, but its not terrible. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a great carbonation and a lightly sweet funky fruit on the back end. This is light, crisp, and clean. I like it.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
