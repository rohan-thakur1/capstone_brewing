724,"2017-04-19",4.8,"Almost a perfect IPA when you consider its a red rye IPA made with Mosaic hops, so I guess thats what gave it the really nice yet subtle aroma (aroma is the only feature I rated less then perfect). Else, it pored a beautiful ruby red gold color with a very healthy head and lacing. The aroma was subtle, that of an IPA, but with a twist, which Im sure the red rye and the Mosaic hops share a responsibility in. Considering these ingredients the taste is unique for an IPA, but world class in taste. Has an excellent, smooth feel on the palate. Overall, Id say its a perfect red rye IPA made from Mosaic hops. The aroma just needed greater strength.","Georgia, USA","Skallish"

Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy body for the style, with a moderate carbonation. 
Finish: Strong bitterness lingers, with a touch of dry roast 
Overall: A really well balanced IPA. Brilliant appearance and a complex aroma blends the malt backbone with a fresh grass and mango aroma. Rye and toasted maltiness balances the aggressive bitterness perfectly. Well done","","TH28"
724,"2017-01-30",3.9,"Bitter, resinous rye IPA, relying more on the piney and floral notes of the Mosaic to power the dry back end. Nice citric middle, though, one that balances out the IBUs and leads to a deliciously spicy rye fade. Caramel malt sweetness adds a nice padding, but the finish is pure hop vengeance.

724,"2016-05-25",3.7,"Im really diggin Mosaic hops this year, they seem to be in a lot of new IPAs and for good reason...they kick ass. The earthen, fresh hops sit well on a healthy bed of rye malt...crushed a 6 pk. of these in one night and could have had more. Tasty beer.","West Virginia, USA","WVHouseofBeer"
724,"2016-05-24",3.7,"L: Clear, rusty brownish red
S: Caramel-covered pineapple
T: The rye imparts a dry lightness and spicy cleanup. The Mosaic hops (HBC369) bring piny citrus up front and finishes with pleasant lemon zest. The caramel malt doesnt add a lot to the initial impression, but no doubt rounds out the bitterness of the hops and rye.
F: Dry, but not parching. Medium body with expected level of carbonation and lacing that seems to last for days.
O: Ive had some brutal ryes and this isnt one. It also isnt overcompensating with the crystal malt despite the prominent addition (45, 65, and 85). The palate stays dry without the compartmentalized sweetness that accompanies other heavier beers in the category (Hop Rod Rye).

724,"2016-01-14",3.9,"On tap, poured into an IPA glass. The aroma is a very distinct rye grain with undertones of caramel and nuts. It pours a clear, brilliant red brown, topped by an off white, big foamy head that has great retention and good sheet lace. The taste is a medium high sweet supported by a medium bitter. The texture is oily with a gritty fizz for carbonation, and a medium body. The flavor profile is initially caramel malt with some citrus up front and a finish thats clean and dry, with a resinous and grassy mouth feel, and rye grain flavor.

724,"2015-12-01",3.0,"Pours a very dark hazy copper color with mahogany edges and a half finger off-white head that slowly settles into a thin, lasting ring. Decent retention leaving sporadic streaks of lacing behind.

Slightly earthy floral hop aroma with spicy rye and a prominent sweet malt backbone. The peppery rye sweet malt presence unfortunately overpower the hops. Strong rye character along with caramel, toffee hazelnut and dark fruit sweetness. Subtle earthy pine character but there is also some citrus/topical fruit sweetness as it opens with hints of melon and grapefruit. Smells decent enough for a hoppy beer that focuses on a particular variety, but its too malty overshadowing the more interesting characteristics.

Chewy full body with a blast of dry, earthy hop bitterness that compliments the strong peppery rye flavors. The bitterness and peppery spice linger over the sweet malt backbone into a dry finish. Again, the rye and malts are prominent but they dont overwhelm the hop profile like in the nose. Plenty of dank resins, earthy pine and spruce tip along with subtle tropical fruit sweetness. A bit more grapefruit than in the arom as well as some tart citrus peel. Peppery rye is most prominent flavor lingering over a sweet caramel backbone with hints of toffee, toasted bread and hazelnut. Easy to drink with more hop character than expected but its still a bit one dimensional and overpowered by the rye and dark malt sweetness.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Very nice nose of tropical fruit (passion fruit, orange), orange rind and rye over a slight malt sweetness.

Medium bodied with a very smooth texture with a creamy aspect. Normal carbonation with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a nice prickly finish.

The flavor profile is intense, not complex and poorly balanced. The rye overpowers all other components. It begins with a few seconds of tropical hop flavor over a subtle sweetness that succumbs to a wave of rye. The rye wave continues through the lingering finish. The middle has a slight bitterness with rind notes.Earlier Rating: 3/14/2014 Total Score: 3.8Pours a beautiful clear amber with a very dark ruby background. However, the final pour from the bomber is almost opaque with flocculants. Full head and lacing that has very good retention. The nose is a bit subdued, but is toffee, caramel and biscuit over slight alcohol and dark fruit notes. The body is medium and somewhat slick with a normal level of carbonation. The flavor profile is complex, balanced and laid back - its there, but doesnt hit you in the face. This quite drinkable ale begins with the flavors of the nose then flows to the spice characteristics of the rye and mosaic hops. Bitterness is almost imperceptible, but of a citric nature.

The appearance was a semi-dark burnt red color with barely any head. Light strings of lacing stick and then slide into the body.
The aroma has a sharp resinous sounding slightly herbal and fruity, tending light rye notes.

On the palate, this one sits about a light to medium on the body giving off a fairly sharp carbonation as a good AIPA should. Sticky clinging harshness runs over my tongue.
Overall, to me, this was a well executed Rye IPA that I would love to have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"
724,"2015-03-21",3.7,"Wow, sweet, didnt look closely, thought this was just the canned version of their Mosaic Side Project (still not convinced its not, save the slightly lower gravity), which I loved, so I picked up a sixer.

724,"2014-12-30",3.4,"12 oz bottle into a pint glass.

A: Pours a semi-hazy copper color. The heads about a finger high, with a pale khaki shade. Its also wonderfully creamy, though retention isnt fantastic. Good lacing is left behind, though.

S: Immediately, I pick up hints of grapefruit and berry from the hops. The malt backbone is fairly evident with its healthy dose of toffee, caramel, and rye. Aromatically, its straight forward, but does a good job of showing off the rye, the Mosaic hops, and the red. Whatever that means.

T: It opens pretty malty, with toffee and rye notes intermingling with some piny dankness. Im not getting much grapefruit, but there is a subtle suggestion of berries near the back end. Similar to the nose, it doesnt really blow me away, but the balance is nice and the Mosaic usage is fairly evident.

M: Good crispness on the feel, and good body, too. Maybe a bit too much body for me, but thats nitpicking. It goes down - if not quite as effortlessly as I like - pretty easily. Carbonation is gentle.

O: Subjectively, Im not a fan of this style. Having said that, this IS a good example of a style Im not particularly fond of. Its well balanced and shows off its advertised components well.","Leonardtown, Maryland, USA","ThisWangsChung"

A nice release from a known brewery this was another generous find from a Florida trader. Proving that there is more to Georgia than just heat and humidity, it is one of those beers that I wish I could get locally. Maybe someday they will expand northwards into the Ohio market.

Aroma / Appearance - A deep maple base grows as the thick white head settles over time. Malt and caramel tease the senses with a chewy texture like a heady wine and chocolate coated red vines. Hanging in the air like a morning fog it sets itself apart from the start.

Flavor / Palate - Warm malts, iced tea, and loaves of rye bread fresh from the oven fill the mouth with flavor. Soothing hops carry effortlessly to the polished finish. It does get a bit heavy by the end but is never unmanageable. This is highly recommended for anybody in the right market who likes hop driven beers.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

A bit more earthiness comes out on the back end and it does have a fairly decent hop flavor but there is nothing about this that strikes me as particularly vibrant or spectacular tasting. There is also relatively nice malt presence w/ a bit of sweetness and toffee-like flavors. It is a bit thin across the palate w/ mild carbonation that doesnt really help matters.

724,"2013-04-16",3.9,"Location: 22 oz bottle from Giannone, 4/16/13


Aroma: The nose of this one is fairly hoppy, some citrus, pine/resin, spice, and some rye bread

Appearance: Pours a dark reddish/mahogany color with a small beige head and some spotty lace

Flavor: The rye certainly comes out more in the flavor, as the taste starts quite bready/malty, and then hops show up mid-palate and carry through to a finish that has more of a resiny bitterness

Palate: Medium bodied, has a bit of stickiness early, average carb, and a long, clean, dry finish

Overall Impression: 
I thought this was a pretty interesting beer.  It has a really very solid nose that is reminiscent of a many hoppy Reds.  The taste is a bit different, as the rye really comes out, and I also detected what I believe to be some small flaws, but overall the flavor works pretty well.

724,"2013-03-23",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 22, 2013 Deep cooper color, bordering on light brown, and the head was a bit small, being one to two fingers thick.  The smell was an aromatic mix of earthy and citric smells with whiff of resinousness.  The smell reminded most of ripening mangoes on beds of straw, and transported me back to summers in Mumbai.  The taste was very disappointing after that inviting burst of smells.  For some reason, there was too little hop flavor, bitter or otherwise, left in the taste.  There was a touch of citrus, and a hint of pine,but otherwise the taste was very dull compared to the smell.  There was some toasted rye flavors coming through, but I was hoping for a Mosaic hop showcase here, and I didnt get one.  The mouthfeel was soft, and medium thick, and the finish was smooth, and clean.  I was hoping for more.

Edit:

I tried another bomber again, and this one seems better than what I remember the beer to be.  There is a lot more tropical fruit in the flavor, and the hops dont appear quite as subdued as before.  There is also an excellent spicy note characteristic of rye.  I am going to up the scores accordingly.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"

724,"2013-03-16",3.3,"22 ounce bottle - $7.99 at Bullocks Wine & Spirits in Marietta, Georgia.

Appearance: Pours a likable, deep amber-hued body with a short (and short-lived), light beige head.

Smell: Slightly earthy, grassy with some citrus, stone fruit, and a hint of mint leaf atop the toasted malt and grainy rye with a thin, thin sliver of caramel.

Taste: Toasted malts edged by firm, crisp rye. The light initial caramel sweetness is soon eclipsed by the accumulating hop bitterness. Hops yield some competing tastes, tropical fruits bouncing against peach puree tripping over mint oil (though, its putting the notion of Orbits Tropical Remix gum in my head). Low grassy, earthiness. Moderate bitterness. Fruity, bitterish. minty-spicy finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation.
