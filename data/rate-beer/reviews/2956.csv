2956,"2017-06-08",3.6,"Pouring at Sierra Nevada Beer Camp 2016 in Boston. Pours a clear gold with a thin white head. Soft corn and cream on the nose. Medium bodied, grain, sweet and full of corn. Softly sweet with a light bitterness on the finish.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
2956,"2016-09-22",3.4,"On draft at Row 34, Portsmouth. We may have hit ""peak craft"", when theres now craft malt liquor, but who cares. Its sweet, surprisingly clean, and tastes like a generic corn lager with a little more hops, but itd go pretty well with a bbq or riding the rails.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
2956,"2016-09-21",3.5,"Draft. Clear golden color, fluffy white head. Aroma of cereal and light lemon. Taste starts sweet, lightly bready. OK.","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","Travlr"
2956,"2016-09-12",3.3,"Im not sure the world needs really good malt liquor but apparently thats what it has. Clear gold with minimal head. Sweet corn predominates but a nice bitter kick in the finish keeps things balanced.","Houston, Texas, USA","dfinney23"
2956,"2016-07-23",3.2,"Sampler at brewpub. Pours golden with a white head. Doesn't leave much lacing. Not a lot on the nose. Kind of sweet on the tongue though very crisp and refreshing as well. Finished clean with no bitter beer face and hides it's booze well. Certainly the best malt liquor I've ever had but given the shittiness of the style that ain't saying much.

The aroma and flavor have corn, sweet malts, mild floral notes, some alcohol, smooth, a splash of caramel, actually drinkable, not something I would repeat, but decent for what it is.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","alexsdad06"
2956,"2015-09-20",3.3,"Tap at Farmhouse Tap & Grill, VT. It pours lightly hazy golden - amber with a decent white head. The nose is soft, sweet, malty, sweetcorn, toasty grain, alcohol and bread. The taste is big alcohol boost upfront, corn, white bread, rubbing alcohol, cornbread, floral, spice, grass and some green vegetables with a warming, boosty finish. Medium body and fine carbonation. Pretty drinkable stuff, which gets ya boosted. Grade A malt liqueur fo sure.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"

Corny, boozy, doughy, some caramel, hints at Apple and grape drink. I kept forgetting what I had in my snifter and then took a big gulp and remembered. Awesome.","Georgia, USA","drowland"

The body is medium side with big corn finish. Dear lord, this is one bad ass malt liquor. Could be the smoothest I ever had. Could be the best ever... Perhaps I need to try more.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"

2956,"2015-05-30",4.0,"Draught at Foundry on Elm SmuttGash event, 5/28/15Light blonde ale with some brassy tinges and a good amount of white head. Clarity and retention are high.Malty in the nose with perfumey alcohol notes and soft, floral hops sitting lightly in the background. The sugars are fairly well-attenuated and Im not getting all that much corn; certainly wouldnt pick it out blind. I think a lot of people would judge this differently blind.The flavor is on the more dry side, though some sweetness certainly remains, mixing with alcohol to create a very floral, poignant, almost sharp note (biting in to a honeysuckle, lilacs, violets). Incredibly smooth, near silky texture with ample carbonation. Just like Liquor de Malt, proof that corn is not an inferior adjunct when used respectfully (more or less, like any other potential ingredient). Loved the stuff, woulda had another.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Light fizz with a medium feel and actually quite refreshing. Overall, this was better than what I was expecting and I thoroughly enjoyed the offering.","New Hampshire, USA","dpgjrnhcraftbrew"
2956,"2015-05-06",3.0,"Lovely capped quart bottle (bottled on 3/15/15) which I will be saving and reusing. Nose is lightly citric, sweet pale malt but thinned by corn. Very clear, very rich golden pour with abundant carbonation and a large, sudsy beige head. Malty, boozy taste lightly perfumed with hops, sweet with corn/adjunct, light spice. Creamy with a touch of corn, varied citrus, clean.  Only slightly crisp medium body, but the maltiness isnt undercut at all. But really, think gentle booze/warmth and perfume ... too classy for the paper bag!","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
