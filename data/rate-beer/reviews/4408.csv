The pour is a light black color, a bit thin as it pours with a thin bubbly collar and s couple soapy spots of lace. The aroma is a little roasty with a light chocolate and caramel and a lingeringly metallic finish. It definitely smells like its best days are behind it. There is a little smokiness on the back end and well see how it holds up. The flavor is pretty invisible. There is a light smoke and a light malt that comes with it, but there is hardly anything there. Its just missing anything else. The mouth feel is thinner and lackadaisically carbonated with a lingeringly smokey and slightly malty aftertaste. This is just iffy all the way.

This bier is the perfect combination of every thing I love about Stouts, Porters and Dark Ales and Lagers.  The only thing is it does not have much head retention which I find makes a bier more attractive to me.
I like it because it has low carbonation, and low but not missing hop flavor, (maybe dry hopped), also was the mellow coffee flavor and not a burnt coffee like in many Porters, Id have to say its a lower carbonated, fuller bodied Kona Pipeline Porter.","Chur, SWITZERLAND","Iheartdarkbier"

4408,"2012-01-22",3.4,"Bottle from Coop, also commonly available in Zurich bars.  Pours opaque with a creamy light-brown head.  Chocolate, molasses, and roasted malt aroma, similar flavor. Taste is lightly bitter chocolate and coffee.  Aftertaste also bitter, but very faint.  Light to medium body.  Alcohol is well-concealed.  This is a nice drinkable schwarzbier, but for me its too conservative in just about every dimension.  A bit more bitterness and body would go a long way.","","lundy"
