The aroma has notes of grassy and piney hops, hint of citrus fruits, caramel and biscuity malts, some minerals and earthy esters. The taste is equal smart with a more hop forward profile then often found within the genre (not to say it is very bitter, just more than normal and APAish like) with a mild grainy and bready background with a touch of hop spice upon the finish, consistent citric fruitiness throughout. The mouth feel is sprite and refreshing abit a tad chalky. Overall this is among the better examples of the style I have come across, that said it then is not really to style either.
