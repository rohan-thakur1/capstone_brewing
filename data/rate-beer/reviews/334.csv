334,"2017-06-10",5.0,"Got that one from Bierhandlung. Shared with Impuritylaw and bastarda. Thanks for sharing the time to drink this beautiful Gueuze with me. Score 5 seemes to be quite overrated but this was (just) perfect. Nothing to criticise except that the bottle was too small and that it seems to be rare. Extremely well balance acidity and light sweetness. Citrus fruits. Bit cheesy aromas. The balanced sourness reminds me of biting in half unripe stonefruits: neither too sweet to distract from subltle aromas nor to sour to make the fruit to hard or unenjoyable. I totally agree with bastardas notes: dextrose dust, freshly chopped wood and licorice.

334,"2017-04-17",3.5,"My Bottom Line:
Really dusty and sour, with a touch of Chardonnay-like butter, this Gueuze startles and satisfies, provided you take it slowly.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A slice of foam covers the misty blond.
-Oddly enough, hops pierce through the flavour profile with some greenness.
-The funk levels are higher than what I like in the style.
-Dry haystacks abound as well.
-This is quite complex, as is the usual 3Fonteinen, but it needs to mellow down a bit as far as I¬ím concerned.

334,"2016-09-15",4.6,"375mL bottled October 2015, drunk 9/9/16, compliments of Rich182. Cheers, mate!Cork flies out aggressively as soon as the cage is removed and the bottles threatens to gush but the foam stops right above the top of the bottle.....The beer itself is a clear, deep bronze, with a large, off-white head atop showing strong retention for the style. Nose is just WOW. Holy crap, this is intense and just so, so, so much expressive, developed brett. Light cellar/must adds depth and funk, with soft wheat/grain suggestions, and only a moderate dose of stronger lactic acids. Just a touch of green apple, may be the only single thing negative I can say about the otherwise stunning, perfect nose. The intensity is just off the charts, but it still maintains a good degree of elegance, as well, for a lambic that¬ís only sat in bottle for just under a year. Great minerality, good malt character and no overt oakiness. I love the sulphur-laden, massively funky Cantillon nose more than the next guy, but this is irresistible in its own right.The flavor delivers, as expected (though the nose sets a very high bar). Lots of brett, with very strong, expansive carbonation that benefits from decanting and breathing. Light maltiness, moreso than in most lambics I¬íve tried, but it works just fine and offsets the sourness, which is here quite well-controlled. Light horseblanket, some lime, guava, cellar must, mineral/limestone and red apple. Dare I say it¬ís kind of like a young Blauw....Lip-smacking acidity on the end is enjoyable and clears the way for each subsequent sip. Had this alongside A&T and though it¬ís quite an age difference, this is easily as good (or better?) than that one. I think this is excellent now and it seems almost impossible it will be anything but stunning for many years to come.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Kinda sweet and sour like a tangerine. Less funky and cheesy than the 2015. Medium low carbonation.

Aromas of barnyard funk, musky wet horseblanket, citrus zest, juicy red apple, faint notes of green banana & unripe apricot, wet earth, leather moist wood - rather complex. Fine perlage, tangy, mellow texture with a medium body. Very light sweetness upfront with a well balanced sourness & tartness waving over the palate with stone fruit flavours. Creates a slick backdrop with a tart bone dry finish. Excellent!","LUXEMBOURG","McWorta"
334,"2016-07-14",4.3,"375 ml bottle @ BBB. High pressure so be aware when opening. Pours hazy very tiny burnt orange with a frothy white head that leaves some sparse fluffy trace on the glass. Smell is fruity, musty and funky with sourdough crackers, grapefruit juice, lemon juice, green apples, hay, dry soil, leather, horse blanket, barnyard, cobwebs, minerals and lemon zest. Taste is sour, fruity, musty and funky. Mouthfeel is sparkling, dry, tart, tiny mouth-puckering and light to medium bodied. Finish is sour and nicely complex despite its young age. Heavy grapefruit with plenty of beautiful 3F cobweb funk. Lovely!","G√∂teborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"

334,"2016-07-03",4.1,"UPDATED: JAN 10, 2017 New 3F geuze, a tribute to both Armand Debelder and his father who taught him the art of assembling lambics - made with lambic exclusively brewed at 3 Fonteinen. From a 75 bottle from Hopduvel, thanks Jan for picking this up for me. Very violent gushing upon opening, alas... Very thick, towering high, lightly lacing, egg-white head, cloudy orange blonde robe with amberish hue. Strong aroma of fruity esters and restrained funkiness, with hints of overripe gooseberry, redcurrant, yellow plum, moldy lemon, sour yoghurt, dry sherry, fermenting oranges, raspberry vinegar, stale sweat, wry grape peel, wet wood, green kiwi, damp hay and - strangely and unfortunately - manure, which I never encountered in a lambic to this extent; luckily it remains subtle enough not to bother me the whole time. Crisp, spritzy onset with an overload of fruity esters, star fruit, green kiwi, sour berries, lively carbo but in a refined way (as in a prosecco), bready malt base and some soapy wheat underneath, lactic sourness throughout more so than sharp lemon or vinegar acidity, yoghurty, juicy finish with woody notes, retronasal Brett funkiness (horseblanket) and a drying tartness, a bit ¬ígreen¬í in some way as well. Unusual and clearly distinguished from other 3F geuzes, but the gushing and the manure accent prevent me from giving this a top score, I¬ím afraid. Clearly this bottle was too young as well, so I tasted this half a year later too from a 37.5 cl bottling and this one lost not only the manure- and green vegetable-like features of the young one, it also didn¬ít gush - and was clearly of a lot higher quality level.  My rating here is an average of both.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

334,"2016-07-02",5.0,"Pours a clouded vibrant orange pulp color, with a big, stable white head.

The funk in this is incredible. Reminds me of a fresh plowed field, elevating the term barnyard to a whole new level. This is more like visiting a rural landscape with animals and farmhouses at the side of the road after the fields got fertilized. The other thing which stands out is its huge lime crispness, which adds a baffling fruitiness to the nose. It corresponds perfectly with the funk, while opening up the aromas to hay, grass, damp old hops, terra cotta, creaky limbs and cream cheese. 

Higher carbonated than your usual Gueuze, still providing a very smooth, soft mouthfeel. A vivid mineralic quality cuts through, accompanied by a unique richness of flavors.

Tastes of lemon rind, producing a pungent sourness from first glance, old Brie, wet vaults and even more lemon. This is way fruitier than the regular Gueuze with a brighter flavor profile to it. Its stony effervescence blends into moldy, soothing malts with a natural sweet note to them, complimenting to the citrus by establishing an intriguing counterpart. Finishes very soft and balanced, with a slowly developing, dryness coated sourness from the back end, which produces a lemon pulp appearance, which sticks for quite a while.

This is it. They somehow managed to improve my favourite Gueuze. It appears to be even more powerful on the nose as well as on the palate than their regular Gueuze, while exhibiting the brewery¬ís typical world class mouthfeel. Its hard to imagine this with a few years on it.","GERMANY","aleigator"
334,"2016-07-02",4.8,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2016 (02.07.2016) 375 ml. bottle sampled @ Beerlovers Bar. Bottled 07.10.2015. Deep orange, a few bubbles rising, solid white head, small fine bubbles. Classical 3F appearance. Nose is bright 3F cellar funk that usually creeps in with more age, there is very bright fruit here, orange, lemon zest, mandarin, very lively beer, nice fruit. Taste & body are very lively, very high fine Champagne-like carbonation, high carbonation obscures the taste a bi, causing it to be a bit empty upfront, leading into orange, orange peel, mandarin, quite fruity & 3F cellar funk, burlap sack, classical 3F basement funk that you would usually associate with a slightly older 3F Geuze. 3F couldn¬ít make a bad geuze if they tried, this one is a bit young now, this should develop beautifully, scores should rise as this one will gain some age. Happy to see this one, gorgeous as one could expect, it will get richer in taste I feel with some age. (31.07.2016) 750 ml. bottle sampled thanks to Tinus. Good but carbonation here was insane & made it hard to drink. Cork hit the ceiling, too much. Keeping the old score.","Antwerpen, BELGIUM","77ships"

Taste is very different compared to the regular. Sweet fruits, green apples, cellar, horseblanket. Leading to an amazing smooth dry mouthfeel. Still very fresh, but allready amazing.

334,"2016-06-18",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 18, 2017 37.5 cl bottle from 07/10/2015 drank right after the release at home head to head with the latest batch of oude gueuze. BEWARE when opening this bottle as it¬ís extremely carbonated and as soon as the cage is loosened the cork and bottle will separate violently. I was prepared for this so I was trying to hold the cork but then the bottle almost shot away... 

Anyway, it pours hazy orange dark golden with big off white head that lasts for a while, unlike the Oude Gueuze where the head disappears immediately. Lots of lemon and green apple, cobwebs, funk, grassy, peach, kumquat, lemon peel, sour grains, mineral. It¬ís quite fruity, almost sharp, with soft green grass notes. Way less leaves and dank cellar funk than the regular gueuze, but I think I prefer this fruityness more. Over medium sour and light bitter. Medium bodied with lots of carbonation. Really good, the only downside is the seriously dangerous bottles. 

07-10-2015 small bottle drank 18th June 2017. Still very carbonated but at least it¬ís not a danger to the ceiling anymore... Very nice again, less green apple and lemon and more funk now. I think this is developing very nicely! Didn¬ít have a lot of this batch so should try and save some for later. Yum!","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","Maakun"

334,"2016-06-11",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 23, 2017 June 11, 2016: 37cl bottle. Hazy orange pour with a tall white head.

It has a fresh feeling (bottled 8 months ago), without too much cheese and barnyard funk. Dry finish, medium body with a moderate and very pleasant amount of sourness.

Nov 16, 2016: tried it again, the sharp freshness is gone, the sulphur greatly toned down, the beer is much smoother now. 

March 9, 2017: the taste has developed quite the peach/apricot/nectarine flavours, some overripe apple, all these on top of the previous notes of apple cider, barnyard funk, hay. Very carbonated, dry and dangerously easy to drink.","The Hague, NETHERLANDS","mariuspoenari"
