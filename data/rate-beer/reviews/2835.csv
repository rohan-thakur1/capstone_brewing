Więc tak. Barwa pomarańczowa, mętne. Piana wysoka, wolno opadająca, długo się utrzymuje tworząc wysepkę na środku pokala, znaczny lacing. Aromat słodowo-chmielowy, wyważony, dosyć intensywny. Czuć chlebek, trawę, jakby przyprawy, masło i cytrusowe chmiele. Nagazowanie średnie - może być. Pierwszy łyk to dosyć intensywne uczucie goryczki, które jednak szybko ginie przechodząc w przyprawowo-słodką końcówkę z lekko zostającymi cytrusami. Przejście pomiędzy smakami bardzo przyjemne.

The head was pretty marshmallowy but it was poured (or emptied briskly into an illfitting stein) at my behest by the bar staff. Bowled over by the initial taste of stern apricot or peach sweetness before a sweeping amount of pine dryness on the palate. The finish with a succulent dewey mouthfeel and hoppy tingle of a linger without any real bitterness that does little more than make you reach for the next swig.
Packing so much into every corner of the standard lager ABV is what makes this such an impressive beer, I cant imagine the quality of gear that goes into the brew for the end result. A phenomenal lager in every aspect.
