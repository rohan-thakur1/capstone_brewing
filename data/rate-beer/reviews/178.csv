Piana obfita (ledwo mieści się w szkle), drobnopęcherzykowa, koloru écru. Gęsto oblepia szkło w chwili opadania, po paru chwilach redukuje się do cienkiego kożuszka, do końca pozostaje małą wysepką i pierścieniem przy szkle. Lacing średni.

Aromat kakaowy, gorzkiej czekolady, w tle lekkie nuty palone.

Smak słodkawy, następnie suszonych, wędzonych śliwek oraz lekkie nuty kakaowe. Na finiszu lekka kwaskowatość i goryczka kawowa, która dobrze ukrywa alkohol. Piwo przywodzi na myśl delikatny likier kawowo-śliwkowy z palonymi nutami słodowymi.

178,"2017-05-13",4.3,"Dun brun foncé quasiment noir et parée dune fine mousse brune (ne nappant malheureusement pas entièrement la surface), cette Porter de la brasserie Nogne vous fera passer assurément passer une agréable soirée : bon équilibre amertume/sucre/alcool et arômes de café/chocolat agréables. Néanmoins, un final pas entièrement abouti et un manque de complexité lui portent préjudice pour une plénitude totale. Au nez, les arômes sont intenses, en premier lieu sur le café, puis le chocolat, le tout relevé par une pointe vanillée : très belle alliance sur un équilibre parfait. Lattaque, souple et soyeuse se présente cependant sur des arômes de café modérés qui ne sont que de simples murmures sur une belle mélodie de chocolat malté. La deuxième bouche gagne encore en douceur, davantage sur le malt, toujours sur le chocolat mais complété par des fruits confits. Larrière bouche qui se superpose et splendide, fraîche, houblonnée, sur des arômes de café francs, saillants. La corpulence est relativement bonne. La troisième bouche souvre alors sur une amertume fine tout en restant modérée (IBU de 30, utilisation de Centennial et Nothern Brewer, aromatiques), avant un final, modérément long, revenant sur des notes de café. Celui-ci manque cependant denvolée et ne permet pas de clore la dégustation de façon flamboyante. Peut être un petit manque sur lalcool à 7 % Abv qui jusquà présent jouait très bien son rôle à la fois dans le soutien aux arômes et à la structure. Le sucre de son côté est parfaitement dosé ainsi que léquilibre malt/houblon très bien trouvé. Le plaisir est néanmoins présent, pour une belle porter sans surprise mais bien réalisée.","FRANCE","jybi"

A gift left over from a previous tasting, the Nogne Porter has held up well for the couple of months that it lingered. That said, I would not try to cellar it for too long or the flavors are likely to break down. Drink it fresh and youll experience a nice European interpretation of the style.

Aroma / Appearance - A fluid black base creeps from bottle to glass with a lazy motion. Reddish edges and a smooth cocoa head add nice contrast. After just a few seconds little head remains. Raspberry, chocolate, coffee, and ash waft upwards with a focus.

Flavor / Palate - The bubbly mouthfeel tastes like a melted truffle reformed into a ball. Both sweet and dry, the texture transitions to a smoky finish. The coffee taste binds together the other flavors from the first sip to the final drop. An affordable import provided a good opportunity to reacquaint myself with Nognes skills.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Fantastic, very unexprected taste for a Porter. Fascinating interaction between bitter coffee and earthy, bready malts, coated up by sweet toffee hints. On top of that, there is a gentle smokiness wich adds a fantastic complexity to the beer, along with a chewy salt infusion. Those different tastes are in perfect balance, which leads to a enjoyable, complex, warm Porter with a soft, smooth mouthfeel.

On the nose, there are notes of roasted malts, molasses, chocolate, espresso and vanilla, along with and herby hoppy note. The flavour is dryish, with toasted malts, nuts, dark chocolate, espresso, dried fruit and a hint of anise; it is balanced with a slight earthy hoppiness. The finish is long, dry and chocolatey with a nice roasty, bitter quality. On the palate, it is medium-full in body, with a satiny texture and soft carbonation. Overall, this is a great porter.

178,"2013-02-09",4.4,"UPDATED: FEB 23, 2013 Black Metal and Black Beer: These are a few of my favourite Norwegian things. I have accused Nogne Ø of being artsy fartsy before, but how can I bear to taste this wonderful porter without bending my knees as if I was listening to a great satanic ode by a Black Metal band? First of all, the aroma. Black currant. Black also. A bit of a leathery (black olive) tone, but it is still sweet, ridiculously sweet, black currant. Dark brown as it pours and black on the glass, with a respectable tan head. This beer is a mouthful. How can they call it just a Porter? This is Baltic black gold! I know, I know, its North Sea, but ignore the geographic subtleties, as Baltic has more relevance in beer history.  Yes, chocolates, roasted malts, the berries, so many (Carpathian?) forest fruits, blah blah blah but it has this great petroleum touch to the tongue, and a high alcohol content that stirs the beer in your mouth, not too raw, but classy and perfectly aware of its surroundings. This beer is in control. Not as bleeding rare as Immortal, or rebellious as Emperor. Not overly sweetened as Enslaved, or too refined as Keep of Kalessin, but just the right balance between sheer blackness and the classy sweetness of the fruits. Yes, this is Dimmu Borgir. A sell out? Cmon, they just make good music as this is great beer. The porter doesnt go as far as playing with a symphony orchestra, but it stands in a podium of greatness, as DB does. If it wasnt for the bitterness of the price, Id have more of it, anytime.","Christchurch, NEW ZEALAND","Cantabrian"

The flavor hits like a proper English porter. The grain runs medium bodied with a nice soft dark chocolate and medium roast. The yeast imparts nice dark fruit flavors and the brew is hearty enough to be slightly warming without being boozy. Light bittering leaves an earthy nutty roasted grain lingering with just enough sweet fruitiness to brighten it and make it a function as a complete and well done beer.

Flavour is a muddled mess of all of the above with a surprising amount of carbonation. I get absolutely no dark fruit at all.

The aroma is discreet at first, but with gradually intensified characteristics of chocolate, coffee, nuts and nice, roasty toast from the malt. Possibly a hint of herbs coming through from the hops. The aroma evolves as the beer warms up in my glass.
The taste is a light sweetness that fades over into a medium smooth bitterness. The roasty aromas are really present when swallowing as well, leaving a long smooth finish.

This beer is fairly smooth which makes it an easy drinker. Though it came in a larger bottle, I didnt find it difficult to finish the bottle. Nice roasted characteristics come through in the flavor, but I wasnt overly impressed with the flavor on this one. There was a tangy sour-like note in the finish that was a little disappointing.

A newly poured porter must be one of the most beautiful sights on this planet, and the Nøgne Ø porter is no exception: a black body with a coca cola brownness at the edges, crowned by a large, dense light brown head. The head isnt as persistent as I would have wished for, it reduces to a thin layer with additional build-up at along the rim in a few minutes. The remains of the head nevertheless laces the glass until the brew is gone. The aroma is roasted with coffee, a hint of smoke and some liquorice. The taste is a fine mix of sweetness and a good bitter finish. The coffee is evident also in the flavours, along with raisins and alcohol. Medium body, smooth and creamy texture, soft to medium carbonation. Once again a very nice and good balanced beer from Nøgne Ø, but as is the case with all NØ beers Ive rated so far, everything is done by the book and there are no surprises.

Bottle, batch 261. Pours with a gigantic, brown, bubbly/rocky head! Very very dark, with a hint of nutty brown. The head is very firm, can grow well above the glass without spoiling out onto the table, and yields to nothing. E.g. tilting the glass has practically no impact on the head.
Great aroma, lots of chocolate/smoke/toast, reminds me of NØ Imperial Brown Ale, but slightly more bitter and more roasted. Very well balanced, with what I consider an appropriate amount of bitterness. Theres a hint of fruit, citrus and herbs on the edges, but the dark malts dominate. A dry, lingering aftertaste as the description says, with a nutty roundness. Gotta love that fruity, nutty, chocolaty malt aroma!

178,"2010-07-26",3.7,"10 ounce goblet - $9.00 at Taco Mac in Kennesaw, Georgia.

Appearance: Passed along to me a body colored black and topped off with a foamy, khaki-hued head.

Smell: Dark, particularly roasty maltiness yielding fragrant notes of conspicuously charred barley, espresso powder, smokey charcoal briquettes, prune juice, and black licorice, though only a hint of dark chocolate.

Taste: A start of pungent roasted grains, modestly sweet, and with tastes featuring bittersweet chocolate and rudely burnt coffee. Minor dark fruitiness. From top to bottom, its fairly roasty with a light astringency to it. The black jelly bean licorice character is building and becomes a bit tiring. Very small hint fo woodiness. Some hop bitterness and acidity showing on the otherwise roasty finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Reasonably smooth mouthfeel.

Drinkability: As with Korean cuisine, Im likin it, but Im just not lovin it. Still, Id say give it a try, as most everyone else seems to be diggin it.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

178,"2010-06-05",3.6,"Kind of a last minute decission to have this here brew. I just wanted something new and something to rate, raded the stash and saw this lurking, and thought why not. It may be 26 degrees C and humid, but Im no seasonal drinker. Anyhow, the beer: Pours very dark red/brown-black with a beige dese head, nice and creamy looking. The aroma is an interesting, but lovely blend of sweet and savoury characteristics. The first whiff reveals a dusty nose, but underneath you have aromas of salty black olives, blackberry and a sweetness I cant quite place, a lighter berry... perhaps cherry or raspberry. I have to add though, the aroma is not massively forthcoming, and seems a little subdued. The flavour is once again subtle, but consists of notes of darker chocolate, some coffee-ishness, dry dates, charcoal, ash and an earthiness not far off black olives, but also reminds me a little of burnt toast. The flavour succeeds in being neither sweet or bitter, its very well balanced, however, it is dry. The finish is a little abrupt leaving you with a slight warmth, fruit, cream and dust. Mouth feel is surprisingly creamy and soft, and also mid-full bodied, which I wasnt expecting as it looked a lot thinner when being poured, than it feels on the palate. At the end of the day, this is nothing radical, but it is a very well made Porter with everything you would expect from this type of beer brewed in Scandanavia; so whilst it hasnt rocked my world, its another big thumbs up for the Nogne Brewery and their skills.","Cambridgeshire, ENGLAND","Beeronaut"
178,"2010-05-19",4.2,"500mL Bottle, purchased at Wakefield Liquors - Wakefield, RI. Theres something about Nogne that always comes across as Boreal, coniferous, and juniper-like to me.

A dense brown-black pour with copious creamy tan head. Flavors are vibrant, prickly, and dense. Lots of robust roasted qualities and a flourishing hoppiness that mingles with an English yeast for a complex addition to the already deep maltiness. Clean, tight, concise and together.

I will of course never buy a second bottle because it is just to expensive but this was a pretty good American porter with a robust flavor.

178,"2009-09-23",3.8,"A: Dark brown with a red hue. Not much light penetration. Big fluffy tan to light brown head. Had to let the beer settle a bit to fill the glass.

S: Lots of roasted malt, some dark fruits like plum and dark cherries, a little hop bitterness, some coffee and bitter chocolate.

T: Just like the smell lots of roasted malt flavors like coffee and chocolate. Slight bitterness but didnt take away from the balance of the beer. A bit of fruit but not so significant. As I drank more I picked up a pleasant smokiness which complemented the roasty notes quite well.

M: At times the alcohol was more present. Quite thick but not overly stout. Good creamy texture.

D: With the heavy body/mouthful I could prob only drink one bomber of this. This it a beer thats good for drinking with a nice burger or steak and savor the roasty complexity of the beer.","New York, New York, USA","Bitzybrew"

Dumped out a massive brown crown even with a soft pour. Super dark brown brew.

The taste is more coffee than chocolate when warm but that flips after awhile. Good bitterness with a slight citrus and leafy hop taste. Some nutty taste as well. Not much else there but that is irrelevant cause its just so damn drinkable. Smooth and higher than mid bodied; finishes dry and bitter. Pretty good.

Malt character is very sweet, manifesting in the form of date, fig, raisin, molasses, and caramel. Coffee and chocolate also shine through to create a grandiose set of flavors.

178,"2008-04-21",3.4,"Hadnt really expected much with this and was really suprised to find out how dry the beer was. There was really very little sweetness left, just a lot of ashy/roasted notes that I didnt find all that enjoyable. The beer looked great though. A nice thick black liquid with a creamy tan foamy head. Aroma smelled a lot like coffee too, with some dark chocolate notes too. I know Im unabashed in my love of stouts, especially those on the sweeter side of things. This beer was clearly on the other end of the spectrum. But still, I did enjoy the beer and would get it again.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"
178,"2008-04-17",3.8,"50 cL bottle. Pours black with a dense light brown head. Roasted malt and chocolate aroma. Promise of a roasted and hops bitter flavour.

Super dark brown with lighter brown and ruby highlights on the peripheries.  The head was two-fingers or more tall and tan.  Clingy bits of lacing.  The aroma was roasted malt, chocolate, light licorice and even a little bit of spicy hops.  The flavor was heavy on the roasted malt and spice with chocolate and licorice nicely cutting through.  Fairly lively carbonation initially but that dissipated quickly.  The mouthfeel was fine, unremarkable.  A nice, roasty porter.","Tulsa, Oklahoma, USA","Soonah"

This has a myriad of small flavors. Every mouthful tastes different. Roasted malt is the main flavor but all the other stuff gets through. Has coffee, chocolate, hops, butter, some straw?berries, some liquorice, other things I have  trouble placing with my limited experience . Bitter finish that I love.

The palate is its downfall, but also makes it a fantastic beer to enjoy the great taste of a fine porter without having to nurse it and think about every little sip.  You can almost gulp this beer and still appreciate it.  Nose of chocolate covered raisins and a hint of yeastiness.  Flavor is big malts, and again, chocolate covered raisins.  Let me tell you, that flavor is fantastic in a porter.  Anyways, the downfall is that it is a little light on the tongue, and there is just a tiny hint of wateriness before the hops dry out the finish and round it out.

The flavor is a completely different story. The first sip told me I was going to like this beer, but as the first big mouthful roller over my tongue I am thinking more along the lines of love.

Nogne Porter pours the darkest of browns with very faint mahogany highlights when backlit. A two finger creamy tan head forms on the pour and as it slowly shrinks just gets creamier. Leaves spotty lacing.

Aroma is exactly what you would expect from a quality porter. Big chocolate notes hit you first and meld with mild day old coffee. Theres a quick flash of dark berries and mild vanilla. Quick wash of pine on the backend. Very solid enjoyable porter aromas.

Flavor is right in line with the aroma. Chocolate hits big upfront and fades to the background but lasts throughout. Mild spent coffee grounds show up mid palate. A quick berry sweetness hits before the balancing pine hoppiness comes along on the swallow leaving a mild lingering bitterness. Very nicely done. 

Mouthfeel is luxurious. Medium bodied with sluggish carbonation creates an extremely smooth velvety mouthfeel.

A good porter to drink the cold winter nights away. This glass is actually disappearing pretty quickly.

My first offering from Nogne and will not be my last. Good solid porter with spot on flavors and aromas. Great mouthfeel.

178,"2007-08-07",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 20, 2008 Rerate on 20.02.2008.  I enjoyed this beer a bit more this time around, but Ive been more hesitant with the high numbers as of late so I think Ill keep it where it is, numerically.  Im getting some vanilla-flavoured pipe tobacco and more cocoa powder than bar chocolate in this particular bottle.  The malts seem more expansive as well.  I ended up letting it sit for a while in my glass and that, of course, solved my carbonation complaint levelled in my earlier rating.  Anyway, I could still deal with it being a little less acidic, but Ill have no problems finishing this one.  50cl bottle, bbe 9/12/09.  Bottle, bbe 19.10.09.  Rich black hue with a tan, creamy head.  Fairly big aroma of chocolate, dates, raisins and espresso.  Too a lesser degree, elements of coffee liquor, caramel, anise and cinnamon.  Flavour begins moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly bitter and finishes moderately to lightly sweet, moderately acidic and moderately bitter.  The flavour has some very pronounced cola-like elements and is not quite as smooth (acidity) as I expected based on the aroma.  Medium-full body with an oily texture and lively carbonation.  I wish the carbonation was a tad softer as well.  Still, very solid.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

Again simple porter flavors, but the fact that nothing is amiss is a big bonus. Toasted malt mix with a light malt bitterness. Sweetness is heavy in the middle and actually lasts to the finish.

Robust, very dry roast flavor, strongly nutty with slight breadiness and hefty chocolate.  Faint tongue-prickling, probably from the Centennial.  Faint hint of salty licorice.  Smooth and silken, but very thin-bodied, almost watery at times.   Aftertaste is dry and slightly salty, lots of nutty roast and slight, dark warmth.

Pours deep black with a dark-tan head; the aroma is a lovely blendy of sweet light chocolate cake and coffee, some robust fruity (blackberry?) notes along with a definite vinous tinges. After the sweet aroma, the flavor is relatively dry and nicely balanced, hints of smoke, burnt coffee,  vinous whispers, a lovely dry finish. Mouthfeel is relatively light despite the 7%, making it lovely to sip without the bursting intensity of some stronger variants.

178,"2007-07-25",3.9,"From a 500mL Bottle.  Pours a mostly opaque, blackish brown color with some coppery highlights edging the glass.  A thick head of well sustaining charred foam floats easily on top.  Lots of soft, medium roasted coffee in the nose with a pleasant chocolate maltiness.  A hint of prune skins and toasted cashews, drizzled with some raspberry sauce; mostly though, its just a great chocolatey mocha coffee nose.  Not too bitter, roasty, or tannic.  Light to medium bodied, creamy carbonated mouthfeel.  Some nutty almond chocolate starts out the palate, meets some mild raisins halfway through, and finishes with a more bittersweet intensity highlighting coffee and dark chocolate liquore.  A smidgen of ash is left in the final smack.  Lots of good solid flavors without much residual sweetness, allowing the malt bill complexities to speak for themselves without any gimmicky coaxing.  It gets a little bit warm on the backend, but doesnt detract too much from the experience.  This is really one that I would classify as a stout, but they can call it whatever they want - at the end of the day, its still a pretty damn good beer.","Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, USA","awaisanen"

Pours the same still, but did need encouragement to form a head. Aroma still beautifully roasty and chocolatey. Wonderfully subtle roasty stout taste - its all there, but theres no punch in the face. Palate perhaps a little thinner than I remember, but still a full taste. Hops a bit drier, and letting the burntness of the roast come through a little more harshly than before. To put points on this, Id probably drop the aroma, taste, and overall by 1 which is a very healthy 3.9

178,"2007-06-24",4.0,"This bottle of Nøgne Ø Porter was picked up during my last visit to Greens.  When uncapped, the beer formed a rapidly rising head in the bottle, but the quickness of my hands avoided any spillage.  In my imperial pint glass, this formed a four finger tall beige head, which looked in stark contrast to the deep black color of the body.  The hefty roastiness of the aroma indicated that this was going to be forceful porter, the kind of drink the vikings would have enjoyed before going on a berserk raid in an alternate brewing universe.  Coffee and chocolate were everywhere in the nose.  The taste was sharp yet soft as the astringent taste and silky body rubbed shoulders in the same glass.  I did not get much of the dried fruit flavors that were mentioned on the back label, but coffee and toffee were definitely abundant.  Slight sourness in the aftertaste, and a hint of bitter cocoa lingered on.  Some brashness in the mouthfeel from the roast grain, but it was right at home in the style.

I would have given it a ""5"" for the initial look.. but a quick recession lost a point.  Even before this had a chance to breathe, I could tell that the aroma was fantastic!... dark and calculated deeply-roasted chocolate, singed molasses, and ample doses of fresh, medium-roasted coffee.. just drew me right in!  Flavor doesnt really skip a step.. well-roasted cocoa, semi-sweet, chocolate, and light espresso form a wonderful base that supports coffee bitterness along with some herbal and woodsy notes.. left a long finish with dueling sweet chocolate and coffee bitterness.. along with some random lactic notes.

178,"2007-05-02",4.2,"Pours a dark brown color with a brown head.  Probably the darkest head Ive seen on a porter.  Aroma is rich of roasted malts, chocolate, slight coffee, molasses, and just a very slight hint of alcohol.  Begins with a very strong roasted malt flavor with lots more coffee then the aroma led on to believe.  The roasted flavors give way to the sweeter flavors of molasses and dark fruit.  Has a pretty decent, slight bitterness on the finish that I was not expecting.  A very delicious porter.","Dayton, Ohio, USA","Lowe1983"
178,"2007-05-02",3.5,"Sampled April 2007
Pours with a three-finger thick, frothy, light brown colored head that dissipates fairly quickly, but ultimately retains a thin layer of foam on top of the beer.  The body is simply black in color.  The aroma has notes of dusty chocolate, roast coffee beans, a touch of burnt grain huskiness and lots of pronounced, dark-malt derived character.

The taste is sweet, yet still the body is fairly light.  It has a medium heft to it as it rests on the palate; it does not have the heft or rich feeling that I might have been expecting from the aroma.  Dusty chocolate flavors are noticeable up front and the finish has a distinct espresso character of burnt acidity, and a suite of roast coffee bean flavors.  The beer dries out considerably after the first few sips and it is not quite as rich as I was hoping.  Still this is a fairly tasty tipple; one which I am quite content to finish.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
178,"2007-05-02",3.8,"Bottle drunk on 4/27/07Gushing bottle eventually settles out to a medium clarity and a very deep, bakers chocolate brown.  Some burgundy highlights and a large, well-retained medium-tan head that laces well.Brown sugar and maple start things off sweet, but it only lasts a moment before dry chocolate and a plethora of prunes, raisins and figs add a delightful vinousness.  Some minimal coffee notes are found in a moderately strong roastiness, coupled with soft vanilla and other pale malt notes, sitting on the finish.  Very clean, but also very fresh and easily discernible as unpasteurized/unfiltered.  You gotta love the yeast these guys use.  It has a delicious earthiness and seems wonderfully English.  More berry-like vinousness/tartness emerges as it warms, but balancing this is a chewy, light fudge-like note.  Love the relative lack of ""hardness"" or breadiness in this one.  Aroma strength is medium-high to high, with no alcohol or flaws perceived.Soft and velvety, with ample malt body, the beer nonetheless remains much lighter in feel than the abv would suggest.  Sweet chocolate layered atop gooey toffee and caramel, with some dry roasted barley adding a bit of tannin.  Chocolate malt adds some light coffee hardness, which keeps the sweetness level balanced.  The main force is a deliciously fruity, vinous berry-and-prune flavor that brightens the beer considerably.  Natural carbonation is in moderate quantity, and though there is some chewiness from the malt, the beer remains very drinkable with no sign of its abv.  Hop bitterness is moderately apparent on the finish, with only a bit of floral-like flavors seen throughout.  Black malt flavors sit on the end: anise, very dry cocoa and some scorched maltiness.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

This beer is screaming that it is an imperial stout already.  Flavor has the malt/hop balance of an english brown porter with its seductive, soft palate and solid bitterness that promotes drinkability.  Good, dark fruit flavor combines with a touch of sweetness, some unroasty, dark malt flavors (this is good) and a smack of bitterness that shows itself profoundly then allows the yeast and malt to shine into a lengthy finish.

The look: Black body topped by a long-lasting small tan head leaving lots of lacings on the glass
In long: Nose is medium roasty and slightly chocolaty.  Black chocolaty cookies, dates and some black liquorice are the main flavours.  Far from an intense beer it is overall rather smooth.  The body is full and the mouthfeel is somewhat creamy and the finish is pretty dry because of the roast.  Gentle medium carbonation.  Nice by-the-number porter that only stands out because of a dryer than average mouthfeel.  Very little hops presence.  The only thing that may leave a bitter after-taste here is paying the high price-tag","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
178,"2007-03-19",3.2,"Bottle pours an opaque brown with a big light tan head.  Little lacing.  Basic roasted malt aroma.  Not very sweet, very dry, roast character lingers.  Good, not great.  Smooth medium body.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","kseecs16"
178,"2007-03-18",4.0,"Thick and black, billowy tan head.  Aromas of sharp cinnamon and cabernet, charcoal and coffee.  Many layers of complexity.  Tastes of mayan chocolate and roasted malt.

178,"2007-03-16",3.8,"Dark brown, nearly opaque, with a large, foamy tan head that shrinks to a small lace rather quickly - quite a bitter, dark roast coffee aroma, with notes of leather and tobacco, and background chocolate malt - creamy mouthfeel, with far less carbonation than the head suggests - leather and wood notes, dried cherries, quite an herbal hoppiness, and an undercurrent of sweet cream and espresso - some bright, berry-like fruitiness on the back end - a solid porter, but not one for the ages.","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"

Nøgne Ø Porter is a very, very dark brown beer that is extremely opaque.  The pour produces a compact, but dense tan head that seems to have a slight purple hue to it.  Coffee is prominate in the aroma with a hint of chocolate and ripened fruit.  The flavor is robust and quite complex as it shifts from coffee to bittersweet chocolate to dark, aged fruit.  A subtle anise flavor is also detectable after the temperature of the beer rises some.  The finish has a rich semi-sweet chocolate flavor with some roasted malt/coffee bitterness.  The body of this beer is full and the mouthfeel is creamy and smooth.  Nøgne Ø Porter is an very well made and well banaced beer that reminds me more of a stout than a porter...

50cl bottle at Bier Circus. Wow. What a head. Sim and I have just sat here watching it settle. It came out so thick it looked like you could stand things on top of it. So solid and creamy. Very similar to the Imperial Stout, just a little mellower. Looks better due to the head and easily worth a 5. Slight honey in the nose. Lots of coffee and dark creamy malt. Very definite cocoa.

The finish is shared masterly between hoppy bitterness and bitterness like that found in coffee. Medium duration, but the base flavor of the beer rests in the mouth for a long time.
