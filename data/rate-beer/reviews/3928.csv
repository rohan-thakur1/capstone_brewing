3928,"2017-04-28",4.3,"On tap @ Copenhagen Beer Celebration 2016. Looks really good this, a deep warm artificial almost red glowing colored one, blurry and on top a small pinkish head. Smells really good and not exactly what I was expecting. Its watermelon sweet and fresh, passion fruit and the surprise fennel! Anise fennel. Lovely mixture of tropical fruits, and its super fresh! Oh this is good stuff. Outs a smile on my face. Thin and oily in the mouth and its just below average on the carbonation level. Super fresh, fruity. Mango and sweet nectar. Passion fruit on steroids. Give me the keg please, want to have this again! 14.05.2016","Bergen, NORWAY","Palme"

Couleur cuivrée/orangée, col fin rosâtre.
Arôme est léger, axé passion qui est lélément principal avec un accompagnement léger de sour mash orienté malt. Le tout conserve un fruité tropical sapparentant aussi à la mangue et goyave.
Palais est axé sur le tropical plus quil ne lest sur un style Berliner. Retrouve les mêmes éléments que au nez, avec un ressenti suret plus prononcé mais qui reste plutôt discret au final.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"

3928,"2015-12-06",4.5,"Sampled (a few times) at The Festival 2015 with Vin. For me, the Passionate Beating was the stand-out offering at the entire festival. Pours a bright pinkish red body with soft white lace. I could smell the nose all day - super ripe passionfruit, mango/melon, pineapple puree and additional sour tropical fruits. Brings me back to the early days of the Florida Berliner Bash. Passionfruit dominates the palate, with juicy notes of tropical fruits, tart raspberry sorbet and a soft sourness that coates the palate. Incredible.","New York, New York, USA","jredmond"

I regret telling a few people at the festival about how good this was because after I did, the beer kicked within an hour thanks to untappd and all the bros at the event. Oh well, I still had 4-5 pours of this epic juice. Poured murky grapefruit color with small head. Notes are unreal with passionfruit puree, pineapple, kiwi, peach, more passionfruit and then some more passion. This is as good or better as old Funky Buddha berliners from 3-4 years ago.
