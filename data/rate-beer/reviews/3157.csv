3157,"2017-02-02",4.0,"From notes. Had at a tasting with the group at Eriks house on January 22. 750 mL bottle. This one is interesting. The pour is a nice cloudy golden yellow color with a thicker white head that froths down with a little lace. The aroma is bright and citrusy up front before rolling through a nice spiciness, more of a floral hop, and a bit of wet oak. Its pretty good. There is a hint of funk and a touch of metallic malt on the back end. The flavor is much of the same. The fruits are nice up front and its got a strong closing funkiness about it for a blonde. The spice grows as it warms, and its just a nicely balanced beer. The mouth feel is light and crisp with a delicate carbonation and a lingeringly citrusy oak finish. This is really nice. I had reserves at first, but its damn good.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

3157,"2016-06-22",4.2,"Bottle drunk 6/10/16.Gently hazy, blonde-copper body is topped by a small, but very dense, white head showing moderate retention.Almost gose-like in the nose, between the spices (which are moderately done), the natural salinity inherent in SAs beers and of course, the lactic acid. Some cream-of-wheat-like character lies behind it, with more minerality and gentle citrus-like acidity on the finish. Wine character is low, which is like, and the wood is soft and gentle here. No big buttery oak notes and no alcohol.Incredibly soft, nearly chewy texture thanks to, assumedly, wheat and barrel tannin. The spices and sour acids keep things dry and add crispness through the middle and on the finish. Santes house yeast has a wonderful almost chalky minerality to it, with light salt accents as well. Things seem a bit more sour/tart than Hill Farmsteads, which Im not as crazy about, but the classy house character is charming, nonetheless.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

3157,"2013-06-04",4.0,"Thanks to Dave for this bottle. Cloudy straw pour with a white head. Pronounced lactic/lemon tartness, some grass, light herbal notes, and stone fruits. A bit of wine, citrus, and oak, too. Theres a nice peach and apricot character to the flavor. Lemon, white wine, grass, and herbs. Hints of oak, citrus, and maybe some tart pear.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
3157,"2013-06-01",4.4,"750ml Bottle, thanks for sharing joet. Pours brassy-yellow and cloudy with plush quarter-inch white head. White grape juice aroma, with lots of pear juiciness and grapefruit pith flavors. Medium-lean with high carbonation. Refreshing and complex. Well-done Tim!",", California, USA","mpersinger"
3157,"2013-05-25",4.3,"750 ml bottle. It pours a nice orange color with a white head. The aroma is definitely tart with great notes of pineapple, grapefruit, mango with very light notes of brett and leather. Theres also some hints of vanilla from the barrel. Very bright fruit character and clean. The flavor is just the right amount of tart with bright grapefruit, apricot and mango notes followed by noticeable but balanced wine barrel and light hints of cheesy funk. Wow. This really is stellar stuff. The finish shows hints of spice, but I cant for the life of me figure out what they are. A touch of graham cracker in the finish. Amazing new beer from one of my new favorite brewers. On par with any of the Russian River sours Ive had.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
3157,"2013-05-20",4.3,"UPDATED: APR 3, 2014 A - pours hazy light golden with low white tight bubbled head. S - light vinegar and sulfur aromas of a barrel sour come on first. Yeast and citrus come on next, with the citrus holding through the end. Lemon zest, grapefruit and fresh orange. Light mineral water and malt end. M - nice tartness throughout. Bright crisp mf. Zippy carbonation. Lightly sweet with a dry pleasantly bitter end. T - the taste follows the nose without the sulfur. Simple acids, tart white grapes, tart lemon zest and fresh oranges throughout. Subtle spices and barrel notes on the palate. Lingering lightly tart, fresh oranges and yeast ending. O - fantastic tart smooth drinkable.","San Francisco, California, USA","deekyn"
3157,"2013-05-13",4.3,"Aroma is fruity and phenolic with a light acidity and funk. Low background malt character present as well. Fruit is pineapple, citrus and pear. Phenolics are a light peppercorn, coriander and some floral spice. Faint lactic acidity and light barnyard funk. 
Pours a cloudy yellow gold with a fairly thin white head that quickly recedes to the edges. No lacing and small legs. 
Flavor is similar to aroma but with a much higher tartness than the aroma suggests. Fairly fruity like the aroma but with more pineapple and citrus and less pear notes. The phenolics are there with a lot more floral notes, but the acidity does not allow them to assert themselves as much as in the aroma. Medium low vinous, white wine note mid palate and moderate bitterness. Finishes very dry. Only faint malt notes in the beginning. 
Mouth feel is medium bodied with medium to medium high carbonation. Low astringency and low alcohol warmth. Nice crisp refreshing beer. 
Overall another winner from Sante Adairius; I must really sound like a homer by now. Clean acidity, nice bright fruit notes and balanced spice aged nicely in a wine barrel - hard to go wrong with that combo.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"
3157,"2013-05-02",4.2,"Bottle shared at the brewery. Pours a deep gold with a resilient white head. Aroma is bright but funky with blue cheese-stuffed kumquats, lime pith, and a mild floral sweetness. Pleasant citric tartness, like dilute lemonade, with citrus rind, key lime, slight oakiness, and fresh grains. Dry and complex, dangerously drinkable. Wow!","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"
3157,"2013-04-24",4.6,"Wow! A refreshing, thirst quenching, mouthwatering stunner from SARA. Clean, yet funky and full of spice. A classic example of a sour, barrel aged blond. Subtle, yet complex layers of yeast, apple, pear, citrus, lactic nuances, buttery barrel, damp wood and spice. Perfectly balanced!!!! Suave, full, velvety mouthfeel. DRY, mouthwatering finish. Jolly Pumpkin-ish. Sooooooooo easy to drink. Lingering flavors of pear, citrus and yeasty goodness. Ummm.. Glad I didn't have to share this bottle!!! An archetypal sour barrel aged blond. Classic SARA! Cheers Tim!

3157,"2013-04-15",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 7, 2013 750ml bottled purchased at the brewery, split into tulips. Pours cloudy orange with a fizzy head that dissipated fairly quickly, with some bubbles clinging to the sides of the glass. Interesting aroma of Belgian yeast, pepper spice, cardamom, slight brett funk, mandarins, orange peel and oak. Small sharp acidic aroma at the end. Taste is actually pretty clean with no presence of barnyard funk that the aroma may suggest. Spice lingers on the tongue and ties into the bright citrus/orange peel flavors. Dry finish with medium carbonation. Nice full body with a clean and slightly tart finish. After the first few sips the finish started to take an interesting berliner style ""bready-ness."" Blast of creaminess with plenty of oaky red wine subtleties. Once it started to warm up the complexities of this beer really shined.","Oakland, California, USA","birdmachine"
