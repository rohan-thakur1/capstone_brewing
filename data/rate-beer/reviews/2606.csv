2606,"2017-05-28",3.8,"12 ounce bottle from Sledutah. thanks! The beer is a clear pale yellow with a white head of foam. Decent head retention. The aroma is grainy with hints of fruity esters. Notes of banana bread and coriander come through. Sweet and fruity. Fairly refreshing. Lighter in body with moderate carbonation and a slick mouthfeel.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"
2606,"2017-03-04",3.3,"12oz bottle pours with a crystal clear pure thin gold body that supported a brief near white head. The aroma offers up bananas, cloves, sweet malts, pears, honeydew melons, floral hops and a wheat sort of hay like sensation. The taste delivers a blend of pear and sweet apple, wheat, banana, some clove and then a modest degree of floral hops. Overall this is on the sweet side making it less sessionable than I would like. The wheat to almost cracker notes do help some but not enough.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

2606,"2016-10-22",3.6,"Bottle. Banana, clove, wheat malt, and straw aroma. Clear golden yellow with moderate head. Moderately sweet banana/orange, clove, wheat malt, and mildly bitter straw flavor.

2606,"2015-08-27",2.4,"I had this one in New Orleans. Its super light. Some lighter notes, hardly any spice or hops. Its certainly a social beer and light enough to where you could probably drink them throughout the day with out any issues.","Indianapolis, Indiana, USA","Block"

2606,"2015-06-24",3.5,"My main target for beer hunting this trip found at the Trolley Whole Foods. Pours out like a classic lager with a bubbly white head. Aroma of wheat, banana esters and lager yeast. Great malty flavor with a hint of noble hops and some citrus notes. Very pleasant.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BelgianBeerGal"

2606,"2015-05-25",3.4,"On tap, Squatters SLC airport. Pours a mostly clear yellow, decent head. Aroma of bananas, faint clove, wheat. Flavor matches. The wheat is subdued, as are the yeast notes. Not a bad example of the style actually, but, like most kirstallweizens, you are left really wishing you had tried the unfiltered original version.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

Not bad","Utah, USA","Sledutah"
2606,"2015-05-08",2.1,"Personally, I hate it, but it is a very unique beer. I am a fan of double IPAs which are on the other side of the universe. I hate the smell of this one, but Ive never smelt a beer even similar. The taste does not agree with me, but Ive never tasted anything g similar so it scores a 10 for unique, but I hate it.","","Leaflight24"
