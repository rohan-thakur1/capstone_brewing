2370,"2017-05-16",4.2,"Wow, this is one massive beer. Bottle at The Swan, Broadway UK. Pours gorgeous dark Ruby red with a medium white head that dissipates. Aroma is dominated by the (Citra?) hops but the dark malts come through as toffee and raisins. Taste is an explosion of flavor. Slightly sweet but enough bitterness to balance. Citrus and stone fruit as well as dried fruits and toffee fill the mouth. Moderate carbonation and reasonable alcohol give a good palate. An exceptional beer, well worth a try if you can find it.","Berwick Victoria, AUSTRALIA","aussiealchemist"

2370,"2017-03-14",3.7,"Botella en 99Cervezas. 
Vierte en un más que inesperado color castaño oscuro (para ser una IPA), más bien turbio. No obstante, después de un rato compruebo que se trataba de turbidez por frío y que una vez atemperada muestra una gran transparencia y brillo en un bonito color caramelo. Espuma media de color vainilla y persistencia media-baja. 
Intensidad media en nariz, predominando las notas de lúpulo por encima de cualquier otra cosa. También algo de queso viejo y pimienta blanca, provenientes en principio también del lúpulo. Complejidad media-baja. 
En boca tenemos más lúpulo, con matices más ricos que en nariz, pero dominando por supuesto el sabor amargo aunque con una base de dulce que lo equilibra bastante bien. Un sabor muy agradable y conseguido. 
La persistencia es media y en boca evoluciona hacia un amargor ligeramente astringente y algo ""polvoriento"" que te deja la lengua más bien seca y que parece provenir en realidad de la malta torrefacta. Aparecen aquí también notas ligeras de café e incluso, después de un rato, algo de regaliz. Es de cuerpo medio y textura acre al inicio y más bien sedosa al final. 
Una cerveza inesperada y difícil de catalogar. No es exactamente una IPA, ni una Amber Ale o Red IPA. Casi parece una Brown Ale con lúpulo a capazos. Una cerveza original, muy interesante y que considero totalmente recomendable probar si se tiene ocasión.","Valencia, SPAIN","JuanCC"

Aroma of pine resin, crystal malt but also a funky soy-y note. The balance is more pronounced in the taste: the redcurrant sweetness is tempered with the slightest souring note. An explosion of flavour in the long bittersweet finish with digestive biscuit, strawberry liquorice, and a touch of medicinal herb. Very well carbonated.

2370,"2017-01-20",3.8,"Rather more thick and full than I had expected - not that I object to such a thing, though I had hoped to be refreshed, as I often am by a red. The beautiful deep ruby of this beers body is as alluring as was promised, I cant take my eyes off it, and the gingery brick-red head on it is equally pretty. I dont get as much citrus on the nose as I would like, the aroma was almost floral, lavender, which was a surprise. A bit of grapefruit on the tip of the tongue, but most of the taste is crystal biscuit and a boozy malbec flavour, with a bit of rather fun watermelon.

2370,"2016-11-22",3.1,"Sortfarvet og ufiltreret Amber Ale med mindre moccafarvet skumtop på 1/2 cm, som svinder til kant og overflade. 
Indledningsvis en let frugtagtig aroma med noter af tørret frugt, såsom rosiner. Lidt citron-noter, men ikke specielt genkendelig og tydelig. Senere åbner der sig en bedre og mere tydelig aroma af malt og frugt. 
Ganske mørk smag af ristet malt og humlebitterhed. Indledningsvis med lette søde smagsnoter af frugt, hvorefter en middel til solid humlebitterhed overtager helt, og øllet fremstår noget ubalanceret. Aftempereringen gør dog kun godt for dette bryg, og balancen samt meningen med det hele fremstår tydeligere. 
Mundfølelsen er blød, og øllet karboneret under middel niveau. Konsistensen er olieret, afslutningen bitter, let tør og kort. 
Overall: Brygget mangler i starten balance IMO og virker ucharmerende med en ubehagelig bitterhedsdominans. Bliver dog mere rund og ganske ""spiselig"" med tiden, så skibet kommer i land.

Looks: Translucent deep copper brown colour with a layer of yeast sediments; One-quarter head and beige foam which fades in 30 seconds; Excellent sticky lacing with near zero carbonation.

Aroma: Fragrant amber malt, with strong grapefruit, shades of peaches, caramel, light toffee, light dark fruits, floral, molasses, pine, light resin, dry biscuits, yeast, strong lemon and very strong grass.

Taste: Close to medium sweet rich Amber malt, with grapefruits, caramel, burnt toast, tartness, light toffee, floral, fair molasses, pine, resin, spices, very dry biscuits, lemon, quite strong bitter hops and very strong grass. Very nice!

Body: Close to full body. Very slick palate.

Mouth Feel: Strong Amber maltyness in a solid and slick background with small degree of wheaty tartness. Loads of grapefruit bitter hops, combined well with burnt toast and caramel. Floral with fair molasses sweetness, distinctive resin ooze and pine. Very dry biscuity and yeasty with strong lemon to round. Sharp and colorful!

Hoppiness: Strong grapefruit, light peaches, floral, pine, light resin, strong lemon and strong grass in nose, same in taste with spices.
Bitterness is close to strong for a lasting, high astringent citrus malty finish.

After Taste: Very dry. Toasty fruity and strong bitter to mouth.

Pours a dark red, brownish color, with a huge orange-brown head. Awesome looking beer with an unusual color combination.

The nose offers an interesting interplay between lemon infused blood orange and biscuity, toffee topped malts. Results in a great aroma variety, ranging from a fresh, fruity bitterness to an earthy, sweetness. Its malt foundation grows more profound as the beer warms up, revealing a coppery hint in it.

Has a medium carbonation among a very soft mouthfeel with a surprisingly full and still refreshing appearance.

Hops are on the palate from first glance, revealing grassy qualities, coated up by earthy, slightly wooden malts. The hops grow more bitter, as lime gets present, as do the malts, exhibiting a gentle sweetness, due to toffee and a whiff of caramel. The sweetness gets perfectly adapted by the hops, producing a luscious fruitiness. The finish then reveals bakers chocolate among soft, earthy malts and dry, pleasantly bitter hops.

A pleasantly hoppy red Ipa, with a very well aligned malt and hop bill, featuring an unusual, dough malt profile. Hops gain the upper hand during the dry finish, while the malts are evolving the whole time, interacting perfectly with the them.","GERMANY","aleigator"

2370,"2013-04-19",3.5,"(on tap @ Mikkeller & Friends) I tried catching this at the CBC in Leather Lane last week but they were all sold out after the release party a few weeks ago and seemingly hadn't received any more. This one pours a semi-clear dark copper with little head and lace. Glass and serving do not lend themselves well to an attenpt at regenerating the head. Aroma is hoppy with notes of tropical fruits and sodapop. Oily texture, soft carbonation, full body with a lingering, moderately bitter finish. Flavour brings a more earthy, leafy, resiny bitterness to complement the more fruity nose. Interesting, pleasant and making you want to explore further.","DENMARK","humlelala"

2370,"2013-04-05",3.6,"Keg at CBC, Clerkenwell. This red IPA is the darkest red imaginable with a yellowish head on top. Fruity hops and caramel in the aroma are shadowed by hints of smoke and campfire. Very nice mouthfeel with a taste falling somewhere between a red and black IPA. First offering Ive had from them and based on this Ill have to try more.","Cheshire, ENGLAND","Nocturne"

Aroma is sweet base and loads of citrusy piney hops on top. Taste is similar with malt, toffee, lemon zest and pineapple. Overall, not entirely my style but quite tasty.","Rimini, ITALY","teorn88"

2370,"2013-03-13",3.5,"Keg @ CPK. The pours a dead still reddish brown. No head whatsoever. The nose is rich red berry, fruit compote. Nice sweet malts, some toffee, a bit of spruce and peppery hop. The taste is wonderfully balanced strawberry jam and sprucy, resinous hop bitterness. Inviting, sweet flavors. The mouthfeels a bit still and lethargic. This is definitely a bit undercarbonated. Overall, a really tasty beer thats nearly there. Looking forward to trying the next batch.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"
2370,"2013-03-10",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 26, 2015 Cask handpull at Craft Beer Co. Dark red brown. Thats a pretty decent beer. Love the malts and red fruits on this. Really good. Again needs a bit more carbonation good american red. Re rate on keg at The Berry Walmer. Flavour is quite outrageous.  I mean its served too cold but there is a plum thing going on that is remarkable.  A bit like Turkish Delight.  some chocolate.  Rather good.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
