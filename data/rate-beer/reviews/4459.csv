4459,"2016-09-14",3.6,"8.2%ABV. Lambic.

Tapped out dark purple. 38ÂºSRM.

Nose has the usual spontan aromas. Strong sweet fruity, blackcurrant jelly or juice aromas. Ribena comes to mind. There is a slightly sweet fruity dimension to the nose which is paired with a deeply wine-like aroma with vinegar, wood, stone dust.

Mouthfeel is unfiltered juice with a bit of fruity pulpy depth. Palate is a little unusual with a smoky, resinous, epoxy type flavors at first, but if you tease it out might be a combination of charred wood and liquid smoke and old hookah water (tobacco in water) and urea, coming on very strong and instantaneously on the palate at the same time as a very aggressive sour tartness, with all this on fumes of alcohol. Otherwise, the palate settles into a sullen vaguely fruity palate with a bitter that suggests tanins, raspberry seeds, chia seeds.

Finish is residual acidity with some bitter-tart tongue-fee that you get with fresh cranberry juice.

A very interesting taste experience.","SINGAPORE","drjoeng"
