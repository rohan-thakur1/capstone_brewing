814,"2017-03-06",3.7,"Pours clear solar yellow with a thick and fairly persistent porcelain head. Aroma delivers crisp pear and fresh malt tones plus a hint of hops. Flavor continues the aroma while taking everything, especially the hops, up a notch. Normally I dont think of pilsners - even Imperial ones - as bold, but this one is! Mouthfeel presents decent body and jazzy fizz. Capsize a glass - but if you get ""capsized,"" please call a ride.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
814,"2017-02-13",4.1,"Poured into a pilsener glass, the appearance was a hazy golden/yellow color with a fluffy white two fingered head that died off at a good pace. Stringy lacing.
The aroma gave way to some citrus pith, floral qualities, and some earthy to grassy tones.
The flavor had a fully crisp bitter hoppy taste pulling the citrus to the fresh leafiness and a touch of floral to resiny bitterness. Smooth balanced crisp sweet aftertaste and finish.
On the palate, this one sat about a light to almost medium on the body with a fair sessionability about it. Moderate carbonation. Appropriate feeling ABV.
Overall, super nice imperial pilsener that I would have again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

814,"2005-10-07",3.1,"(22 oz bottle: $3.80 at Liquid Solutions in Tigard, OR) 2004 series.  This smells wonderfully malty for a pilsener, even if its an Imperial version.  But the flavor is a bit too citrusy, somewhat tart, and just tastes a little ""old"".  But as the beer warms up, both the nose and flavor become more and more earthy, proving to me after the fact that this beer isnt much of a candidate for aging.  The body is medium, with light carbonation.  The orange-golden and somewhat hazy body is capped by a tall, very long-lasting, off-white head that never drops below a quarter inch.  And wow, large patches of dense foam cover the glass.  This wasnt bad, but its clearly past its prime.

814,"2005-04-27",3.3,"Bottle courtesy of Wohlfs. I am not a pilsner fan at all, but this is half way decent. Maybe because its not a true pilsner? Lots of floral hop aroma and a little skunk.

Aroma was predominantly sweet with some biscuit notes, also a bit of floral, perfumey notes.  Flavor is strong lager with similarities to some malt liquors I have tried.  Pretty tasty notes of biscuit, grain, and some bread.  Points off for the strongish alcoholic sense, even though it doesnt burn.  I think Double Pils is a failed concept.  The pilsner style is about purity, clean lines, and sublety all of which this beer flies in the face of.","Bedford, Texas, USA","TChrome"

Full bodied, yet crisp on the tounge, there is some grassiness mingling with the alcohol. A definite improvement over the Rogue I have tried, the only other imperial pils to meet my acquaintance. Big for the style, and hardly reminiscent of the pilsners I am accustomed to, this beer is nevertheless quite drinkable and easy to like.

The aroma has notes of grassy and floral hops with a sublime spicy character, some lime and orange notes, and a hint of biscuity malts. The taste starts fruity (mostly citric) and herbal and some malt background. A big dose a forceful bitters shine through and are very lively on the palate. The finish displays the same light spice found on the nose with a different, almost subdued lingering bitter quality. The feel is aggressive and lively but does finish with a papery dryness.

Seem too thick to the old nose. Sweet flavors abound. Floral/ herbal flavors mingle with dry malt and wood. Somewhat biting on the palate both from carbonation and light acid. Alcohol is perceived late in the quaff, but does not overpower. Not as clean as I would like a pils/lager. Very much like some of the strong European lager. I do notice a late malt linger that is very pleasant, but some times the pleasantries are to late to redeem previous thoughts. Thanks Derek.","Wauwatosa, USA","JPDIPSO"

Smells like...Oh, so good b-e-e-r: Malt-O-Meal with a shot of wheatgrass juice.

This puts my tastebuds on edge with an astringent bite, then ties them up with hop vines. Now the interrogation begins over-buttered scones. Theres plenty of dry humor, and bitter barbs. Its like talking to an ex-girlfriend whos hoppier now; shes making more money then you, she has a great new boyfriend, a nice car and house, (Is that a boob job?), and she still has that sharp sense of humor.

Big mouthfeel, full blast of tantalizing hops that sweetly ring the mouth, before drying out. This play on the palate returns in every sip , and before long the larger than average ABV starts to ring forward and rise above the flavor, projecting itself as a major player in the overall profile. Now, Im not sure why the meaning of this brews name escaped me so far, but I get it now!

It has the definate characteristics of both. Name a taste of either and it's there. Yes, I'm serious. The alcohol is not masked at all, though.

Sharp alcohol and medicine flavors that are highly unappealing;  In fact, it is very similar to cough syrup.  It even somehow manages to display what a horribly made beer this is by finishing both astringently and cloying.  Doesnt look, taste, or smell like a pilsner.  Bad bottle?

814,"2002-09-17",2.5,"I agree with ecrvich, and I quote sweaty yeast (and grapefruity hops) ruins the aroma and flavor alike.  Considering that I love a good pilsener, and also a strong beer, I had high hopes for this.  But it tastes amateur-ish, although this is a well established brewery. I paid good money for this, and feel ripped off.  It is cloying, and over-hopped, and basically, it sucks.  Another quote from an earlier review: about time someone made a lager that took the hop character to IPA levels.  WHY???? It tastes like an IPA, and a one-dimensional West Coast one at that.  Dont bother.  PS - I had to add the fact that almost all the people who rated this highly are from Oregon...","Loveland, Colorado, USA","Ringo"
814,"2002-09-16",4.1,"Full disclosure: Full Sails my fave brewery.  That said, Capsize is a must taste beer.  Perkeo below is right--it is the kind of beer Ive been hoping to see one day.  My sense is that the beer was more in keeping with the style than some of the other raters here: wonderfully crisp, backed by a luscious layer of malt, just ever so sweet in the finish.  Its a big boy, but not at all green and nicely balanced.  Good Stuff!","Portland, Oregon, USA","Troobie99"
814,"2002-09-03",2.5,"2002 bottle. Head is initially average sized, frothy, off-white, mostly
diminishing. Body is clear dark yellow. Aroma is moderately hoppy
(grapefruit), lightly malty (toasted light bread), moderately yeasty
(sweat, dough). Flavor is moderately sweet, moderately bitter,
moderately acidic. Finish is moderately bitter, moderately acidic,
lightly sweet. Medium to full body, creamy texture, lively carbonation,
lightly alcoholic, lightly astringent. Not impressed...sweaty yeast (and
grapefruity hops) ruins the aroma and flavor alike.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
814,"2002-09-01",4.0,"Malty and slightly estery aroma--warm, substantial and very pleasant...Color a rich orange-gold with fluffy head that stays ""busy""...Rich, well-balanced malt profile dominates the flavor spectrum, but hops chime in with a restrained but sharp supporting snap that lasts through the finish. Zesty Saaz spice is a welcome side sensation.  Body is satisfyingly full and its overall richness (along with healthy ABV) warms the soul as well as the body...So to those who lament the anemic character of too many pilseners: Take heart! A savior has arrived---although by all indications, for a limited time only...","Des Moines, Washington, USA","KingPinHead"
814,"2002-09-01",4.0,"Nice malty aroma, and a darker amber than the usual pilsner you see, with a white head, and nice lacing, thought the head diminished rather quickly.  Lots more flavor than their regular pilsner, with malt dominating, though the hops came in at the finish, with a slight bitter hint.    This was quite good, but is a Brewmasters Reserve limited release, so it wont be around long.","Portland, Oregon, USA","AxeMaster221"
814,"2002-08-19",3.7,"A huge step up from thier regular pilsner. This was full of taste, with nice ABV. Very spicy and dry. A fine beer.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","Murphy"
814,"2002-08-18",4.4,"never heard of a double pilsner before.  nice floral nose.  pale in color.  flavors are simple, but satisfying - malt and hops.  the zippy bitterness and relatively high alcohol content balance the moderatly thick malty body.  sort of like a cross between an IPA and ur-bock.  very good.  upgraded rating after my second bottle - excellent.","USA","rich42"
814,"2002-08-17",4.5,"Original rating was (accidentally) low on overall impression...Nose of wet (fresh) hops and malt. Its a mouthful, with IPA-like bitterness levels but the smoothness of a Maibock...about time someone made a lager that took the hop character to IPA levels. Tastes like domestic rather than Euromalt, which is really my only gripe...a fabulous drink!","Portland, Oregon, USA","Perkeo"
