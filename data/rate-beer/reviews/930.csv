930,"2015-04-20",3.6,"Had at the brewery months ago. Just getting around to checking in their beers. Poured an amber with a puffy eggshell head and decent lacing.

930,"2014-12-24",3.3,"Rated on 02-27-2013 at Fullsteam Brewery. This draft beer has a small beige head with a short retention, transparent amber body, very little carbonation, and a good amount of lacing adorns my glass. The aroma is lightly grainy, herbal, earthy hops, caramel, and bready. The flavor is light hop bitterness, light earthy hops, caramel, and bready. The mouthfeel is light carbonation and this beer is light-medium bodied. A very quaffable beer that is not overly hoppy tasting and is worth trying.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"

930,"2013-02-27",3.3,"This draft brew from the brewery poured a head of foamy finely sized white colored bubbles that were mostly lasting and left behind a transparent orange colored body and a good lacing. The mild aroma was malty. The mouth feel was tingly at the start and strongly tingly at the finish with a medium hoppy aftertaste. The mild flavor contained notes of mild caramel oak and hops.

930,"2011-06-28",3.5,"Pours a rich, deep amber color with a substantial, creamy, medium-tan head. The aroma is faint but pleasant, with a combination of cereal grains, a light woodsy mustiness, and a little caramel sweetness. The flavor is much more pronounced, with characteristics of sweet brown bread, a little butterscotch, and a nice pine and floral hop bitterness. The fine, light carbonation is active yet unobtrusive, but it allows the bready sweetness to linger a bit more than I would have liked.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","devilben02"

930,"2011-02-27",3.2,"On tap at Tylers in Durham, listed as ""Carolina Common.""  Pours clear golden-copper in color with a small whitish head and some lacing.  The aroma is decent, with biscuit malt evident, caramel, and herbal hop notes.  The flavor is more or less standard California Common, with caramel, biscuit, and earthy hops that lend some bitterness.  A bit sweet if anything.  Medium-bodied with average carbonation, the expected mouthfeel pretty much.  A good beer; certainly better than average for the style.","San Francisco, California, USA","nickd717"
930,"2011-02-16",3.8,"Growler shared by drabmuh at a recent tasting.

Pours a medium copper color with a nice off white head and a good deal of lacing down the side of my tulip. Nose is pretty faint, but brings forward some caramel malt as well as some slight herbal and floral hops. The taste takes it up a bit. The malt is the center of the show, but there are some faint hops making there way through, although not adding too much bitterness. Not particularly sweet. Moderate body with good carbonation. Drinkability was really nice, and I enjoyed the crispness of this one to start the tasting off.

Also of note was the growler glass itself, which was quite cool.

930,"2010-12-13",3.3,"Draft at the brewpub; JCB told us this was formerly known as the Carolina Common, which I think was a better (and probably more accurate) name.  Pours a clear copper color with a small white head.  Looks like the Schlafly Pi Common I had last month, and its nice to see more brewers taking a crack at the style that made Anchor famous.  Aroma of earthy hops, sweet malts, straw, leaves, and toast.  Flavor of sweet malts, sugar, earthy hops, straw, yeast, and wood.  Light-bodied, with sharp carbonation and a toasty mouthfeel.

930,"2010-10-16",3.4,"Interesting beer given I come from the land of Anchor California Common: San Francisco. ;-) Got this beer as a bonus from a trade. It was a bottle fill from a growler.

This is Fullsteams take on the Cal Common style using the same hops and (I strongly suspect) the same yeast. The Fullsteam version has a deeper, richer caramel malt character. Anchors version has more emphasis on the Northern Brewer hops and just enough malt to balance. 

Fullsteam also has more fermentation character. The Cal Common yeast is a hybrid: a lager strain selected to ferment at ale temps. As such, it likes to through more esters than a typical lager yeast mostly in the form of isoamyl acetate or banana. In Fullsteam, it yields an interesting aroma most reminiscent of banana bread. 

Aroma: Sweet banana bread with woody mustiness from the Northern Brewer hops.

Appearance: Light copper and mostly clear. Some fine suspension, but no chill haze. Thin white head the persists only along side of glass.

Taste: Initially malt forward, then quickly moves to a fairly bitter finish that is somewhat balanced by the malty caramel sweetness. The banana bread carries over into the flavor as well, but although quite unusual, is not unpleasant. The woody hop flavor adds a dimension that helps balance the caramel.

Palate: Medium body with mod/low carb. Smooth with no astringency.

Overall: An interesting take on a regional style. The additional caramel malt sweetness with the elevated fermentation character adds a dimension to the beer that takes it in a completely different direction than Anchors Steam Beer. Fairly firm bitterness but with some residual sweetness in the finish that competes for dominance. A good solid beer.","California, USA","TheRabidBrewer"

Luckily, Ethan was around and could get it.  Pours a relatively translucent golden amber with little a foamy white head that fades leaving a solid white lace around my fullsteam jar with a handle.  Carbonation seemed low on my first pour, but I got much more of a head (to begin with) and it feels more carbonated overall now.   Aroma of caramel malts, banana bread, light menthol, light hops.
