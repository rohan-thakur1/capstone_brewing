3496,"2017-05-22",4.1,"Cask half-pint at The Crown Inn, Oakengates on 28th Apr 2017. Most likely the beer of the festival for me, loved the richness and flavour. Black bodied, thin beige head. Loads going on in both the nose and taste: coffee, treacle, chocolate, singed toffee and a light piney bitterness. Not as sweet as my description may indicate, this was a well balanced and tasty Mild.","Shropshire, ENGLAND","BlackHaddock"
3496,"2016-12-15",3.7,"Cask. Intriguing aroma that modulates from smoked wood and toast to begin and then reveals coffee and chocolate malts. Impressive. Pours very dark brown with tan cream top and ruby notes. Taste is creamier than I was anticipating with caramel and coffee to the fore and thus sweet but the finish is more blended. It stays on the palate and could cloy but overall a fine mild and for my money the best of the Muirhouse range currently.","Nottingham, Nottinghamshire, ENGLAND","theprof"

Bittersweet initial taste, but you becomes aware of the sourness as the pint goes on. Almost Guinness-like. Bitter-sour finish with a grainy coffee taste.

3496,"2013-08-02",3.8,"On cask at the Derby Beer Festival

Since there was nothing good on in the local Derby bar I headed down the hallway to try a few Muirhouse beers. After sampling them I am convinced that they might be one of the better breweries at the festival. This mild is a good example - flavorful and rich without being so overwhelming it is no longer sessionable.

Aroma / Appearance - The reddish black base and thin layer of tan head rest in the glass peacefully. The lack of carbonation is no surprise given the cask treatment. Roasted coffee, bittersweet dark chocolate, and malts tickle the nose. This smells like the office coffee pot right after the last drop comes out of the percolator.

Flavor / Palate - Coffee, dark fruits, and chocolate rinse clean the palate and lay a foundation for enjoyment. The texture of slightly burnt toast carries into the dry finish. Tasting of one dollar coffee from the gas station it has this cheap feel that somehow works with the other elements. If I could only have tried one beer at the festival this would have been no letdown.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
