4136,"2017-02-20",4.3,"375ml bottle pours with a clear purple body that tosses up some nice legs. The aroma offers up sweet honey nuanced raspberry goodness with thin ripe cherry notes in the background as well as thin honey and honey comb waxiness. The taste delivers rich deep smooth honey sweetness and then a moment later rich nectar like honey sweetened raspberry fruity jamminess. To midway it picks up a mild raspberry tannin skin like note that doesnt do anything up against the smooth rich sweetness. Wow. This is money.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4136,"2017-02-08",4.6,"Bottle 163/224. Shared by my buddy Tommy on my birthday last year. Pours deep red. Nose is big and fruity--lots of raspberry and cherry juice with well balanced tart/sweet ratio. Flavor is similar; lots of raspberry, cherry, light honey, really well done. One of my faves from Schramms.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

Light raspberry, bilberry, blackberry and floral honey. Currants. Sweet, sour and fruity. Oily, viscous, round, tart mouth. Long tart raspberry, sweet cherry & honey finish. Insane berry character.

4136,"2016-12-29",4.8,"Pours a glorious dark red. Almost looks like blood lol. Smells like raspberry juice. The interplay between the cherries and the raspberries is superb. They are both in there and are both fighting for dominance. Just lovely.","Canton, Michigan, USA","lbnlaxer"
4136,"2016-12-28",4.5,"December 28, 2016. Bottle, courtesy of _angst_, thanks!

Clear reddish purple with some nice legs. Aroma is very fruity with a nice sweetness, lots of cherry juice, raspberries, some floral honey notes.
Taste is sweet, fruity and light tart. Full bodied, oily texture. Finish is sweet, light tart, lots of juicy berries, floral honey, light tartness. 
Amazing balance between the sweet honey, juicy berries and tart berries.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","hackobock"
4136,"2016-12-28",4.3,"Bottle. Clear red/ruby color. Fresh honey aroma, berries, raspberries, red currant notes. Great honey and red currant beer, raspberries, cherries, slightly spicy. Great stuff.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","rlgk"

4136,"2016-12-20",4.3,"Thick syrupy and delicious. Sweet, tart and loaded with cherry and raspberry flavors. Great stuff.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
4136,"2016-08-29",4.0,"375 mL bottle. Pours a deep reddish purple. Smells of strong and rich cherry and a sharp raspberry. Kinda odd, too. Like the cherries are spiced or something. Boozy, maybe thats it. Tastes of a rich dark cherry flavor and a hefty boozy bite. Sweet honey, of course. Raspberry is a secondary flavor, lends some sharpness and acidity. Heavy, sweet, and boozy. Different take than the other Schramms fruit monsters. Heavy cherry and a tart raspberry juxtaposition. Im still really enjoying this, but not to the awe-inspiring levels of Black Agnes or Heart of Darkness.","Florida, USA","ctipping"
4136,"2016-03-29",4.1,"375 bottle B1 38/224. Deep ruby red. Taste is cane sugar sweet cherry raspberry smoothie, with a thick port wine body. Hits you with intense flavor like a jolly rancher. The slightest touch of honey wine. As much as I like this stuff the rarity throws the price off. Taste wise this is on par with the raspberry and the statement but because its rare it is worth much more. Either way its delicious.","Illinois, USA","rxeight"
4136,"2016-01-17",4.8,"Pleasantly surprised, did not care for on tap as much as I normally do. Damn near perfect out of the bottle.","","Jb123"
4136,"2015-11-17",3.9,"dark cherry aroma and taste, moderate sweetness which is light for a mead. Very deep flavors of velvety dark cherries. Impressive.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
4136,"2015-11-14",4.5,"Nice dark cherry smell. Taste is super rich berries. Lots of cherries and red licorice. Medium body, no carbonation, and a slight alcohol tinge.","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BiiruBierBeer"
4136,"2015-10-30",4.1,"Bottle shared by Armin, thanks!! Beautiful red pour with purple hues. Boozy cherry and raspberry nose. Massive jammy fruit - both raspberry and cherry are there. Yummy.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","Bacterial"
4136,"2015-10-30",3.9,"Pour out of 375 mL bottle, clear dark red pour with no head, aroma brought big cherry, berry, some medicine, hints of vanilla, big honey, floral notes, hints of spice, cinnamon. Taste was a mix of dark cherry, berry, raspberry, hints of dark cherry, spice, hints of sweet honey, vanilla, slight floral honey, finishing fairly sweet, slightly spicy.","East Lansing, Michigan, USA","arminjewell"
4136,"2015-09-14",4.0,"Pours deep red. Aroma is cherry with notes of mixed berry. Flavor is full on cherry up front. Rich, sweet and deep with hints of tart and tang. The raspberry is there as well in a complimentary role. Rich and sweet with the honey showing through. Medium to full in body. Another awesome Schramm mead.","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
4136,"2015-08-03",4.2,"Finally got to try this one. Glass from the meadery. A deep Crimson color. Great fruit mix nose that goes right into the flavor. Very good.","Michigan, USA","SpongeRuiner"
4136,"2015-08-01",4.1,"Pour to stemmed wine glass at Schramms. Looks good; a still and slightly hazy black cherry. Smells good too; a nice, robust blend of cherry, raspberry, and honey. Tastes like it smells with a smooth medium full-bodied mouthfeel with a bit of tartness on the back end. Outstanding.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"
4136,"2015-07-18",4.2,"Color is a beautiful deep red and still. Aroma of cherries and honey. Taste is slightly tangy and crisp. Tart cherry and raspberry. Sweet thick mouth.","bloomfield, Michigan, USA","mikem409"
4136,"2015-05-29",4.1,"Tap at Schramms. Deep red pour, still. Big sweet cherry aroma with hints of berries, red wine, and light alcohol. Tastes moderately sweet with a nice tart raspberry finish. So smooth and syrupy. Full bodied. Interesting mix of The Statement and Raspberry. The sweet cherries over-power the raspberries for sure but you get just enough in the finish to notice them. I still prefer the Raspberry on its own for sure.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
4136,"2015-05-24",4.3,"On tap at the schmeadery. Pours a still, crystal ruby. Aroma of deep Berry and honey. Taste is a phenomenal balance of sweet raspberry and tart cherry and honey. Lingering sweet-tart finish. Medium body.","New York, USA","tchaos"
4136,"2013-12-22",4.0,"Solid mead blend of the statement And raspberry meads. Less medicinal that statement but sweeter that raspberry.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
4136,"2013-12-22",3.7,"Poured at Schramm's Mead. Poured clear pink red. Aroma of cherries but can defiantly get the fresh strawberries. Light tingle on the tongue. Tarter than the others with some astringency.","New York, New York, USA","charule"
4136,"2013-12-01",4.1,"UPDATED: AUG 5, 2015 Tap @ Schramms: Deep crimson red color with some darker mahogany highlights. Aroma is lovely with notes of spiced cinnamon apples, black cherry flesh, light raspberry, & mild, fragrant perfume. Somewhat jammy & very fresh with dense fruits & spices. Taste contains some sweet honey, light apples, & jammy cherry flesh. Not as much cinnamon/spice as the nose would indicate. Lighter notes of tart raspberry in the finish. Another very nice mead from Schramms.","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
