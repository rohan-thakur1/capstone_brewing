484,"2013-04-03",3.4,"UPDATED: APR 5, 2013 I am a bit embarrassed that this was my first trip over to the Wrecking Bar.  The ambiance was as good as described by friends, and thus, I was excited to give their beers a try.  This poured dark brown with a brown head.  If a good coffee stout is infused with shade grown fair trade, this was Maxwell House.  Light on flavor.  Might benefit from a bit more alcoholic punch.   I will give it another try in the future, but tonight it just wasnt my cup of tea (pun intended).  Draft - Wrecking Bar - Atlanta, GA","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","EricTeusink"
