2357,"2014-10-14",3.7,"February 17th, 2013 - I love a beer that has an unidentifiable style. It grapples with boundaries, pushing them and warping them, much to the benefit of the drinker. Under this category of outré brews is Alesmiths My Bloody Valentine - a departure from my favorite beers there which are decidedly dark and boozy. The smell is spicy, with lots of grape juice and grape Kool-Aid, old and dusty wood, clove, and a little juniper, with some brown sugar too. The flavor thunders with a heavier booziness than the smell portends. Caramel and dark sugars greet the tongue, heavy and callous, almost like a large, blundering stout. Add in raisin and fig, blackberry and a nice juniper dryness and you have a nice, dark mix of sweeter high notes and sluggish low notes, and a constant line of hops bitterness all the way through.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

That incident aside, lets now move on...! Pours a nice uhm, well, bloody brown/red with a substantial head which leaves heavy lacing on the glass.

I do have to say that the bottle was picked up last August, so that beer must have been brewed around December 2012...some aromas ought to have evolved. Taste is rather sugary, with the herbal hoppy bitterness balancing it off nicely. Mouthfeel is really nice; it has this slick texture that is usually found in higher abv brews.

2357,"2014-03-02",3.7,"Bottle; Pour is dark mahogany, with a one finger, fine bubbled khaki head this glass. Its not as nice looking as Evil Dead Red - whatever. The nose is caramel, biscuit notes, with a nice american hop profile, but theres a mineral presence as well here that takes it down a notch. Retention was fairly poor as well. Whatever. The flavor profile shines though, but Evil Dead Red is the king, if youre wondering. This one is sticky caramel buns, more minerals, pine and citrus notes, with some light fade near the finish. Its a proper amber, for sure, but Ive got Evil Dead Red on the brain.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

Wonderful nose of chocolate covered cherries and a sharp tartness of red fruity berry, atop a mildly bitter floral hop resin.

Very nice and interesting. Finishes with a light touch of chocolate.","Denver, Colorado, USA","onceblind"

The aroma offers up sweet malts, some sweet nuttiness and then a hoppy mix of black licorice, pine resin and floral hops. The taste is nice and rich with a pleasing malt to hop balance. It has slick sweet malts, some sweet nuttiness and then it gets into pine hop resin, bitter floral hops and some hoppy spicy dankness.

It has been a while since I visited an Alesmith rate. This looked like a good one given the time of year. A fine amber ale made the January snow melt away. If it comes around again in 2014 I would certainly pick it up or order a pint as a starter at the tasting room.

Aroma / Appearance - A ruby semitransparent base is trapped under an ivory ring of head. Musty cedar, almonds, and dry chocolate permeate the air with a soft feel. More malt driven than many West Coast amber ales it strikes a nice balance.

Flavor / Palate - Malt balls dipped in dry semisweet chocolate fill the mouth with a pleasant texture. Warming the palate after a few sips, it betrays that this is not a mild mannered sessionable amber ale. Sticking in the throat with a dry bitterness the outcome is a very well rounded release that shows all the hallmarks of a beer well worth the $8.99 price tag. If you see this on the shelves and want a change of pace from hop bombs or big imperial styles this fits the bill.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

The hops chime in with a gently citrusy, fairly juicy presence that closes on the leafiness that had first been noticed upon smelling. Clean and fairly easy to drink, becoming toastier and toastier as it warms, yet maintaining its bitter backbone in good proximity to keep the residual sugars at bay.

2357,"2013-04-15",3.7,"Aroma is fairly balanced between malt and hops. Malt character is very bready with some caramel notes. Hops are rather grapefruit forward with some resin and dankness. Not super fruity and more toasty than caramel. 
Pours a deep burnt amber bordering on light brown with a thick light tan head that slowly receded until a film is left on top and is a bit thicker on the edges. Medium lacing with medium legs. 
Flavor is very malt forward with notes of toasted bread and light chocolate being most prevalent. There is also some dark caramel flavors. The initial taste is similar to a tootsie roll mixed with toasted bread. Mid palate you get some resinous and dank hop notes but not much citrus, just faint grapefruit. The finish has more hop resin and very toasted, almost burnt bread. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodies with medium carbonation. Low to medium low astringency, some of which is from the hops. Low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, not a bad beer. The malt character tastes more like a brown ale than an amber or red ale and the hops character is fading leaving just the hop resin.

2357,"2013-04-06",3.6,"Great looking beer. Pours a deep maroon. Looks pretty transparent. No haze or lees apparent. Nice big head, light beige. Its a bit rocky but sticks around for a long time. The aroma is a mix of floral and bright citrus hop notes. Theres a little spruce to the beer, as well. Underneath the hops, some caramel and toastier malt flavors come through. The taste has good hop flavor, nice delicacy/complexity. The malt plays a larger role than in the aroma. Good depth from the darker malt. It almost has a light chocolate flavor. In both the aroma and taste, the beer just lacks somewhat in intensity for the abv. For a ~6.5% abv beer, I just want a bit more. Mouthfeel also doesnt really help, as it gets a bit watery in the middle. Still, its a good beer. I just wish there was a bit more to it.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"

Pours a darker than anticipated mostly opaque mahogany complexion, consistent throughout although a touch lighter at the edges and topped with a fluffy soapy medium tan head...

The hops become more vibrant after warming, some additional hints of pine, but still maintaining the balance with the grains... Biscuity caramel and toffee dark malt profile upfront with an adequately developed clean green piney citrusy hop backing component that barely plays second fiddle as the malts seem to be slightly favored overall. Semisweet on the frontend as well as through the middle but finishes with a mild bitter note.  Medium bodied or just shy thereof with a decent level of carbonation to go with the aforementioned.

Pours a blood red with a tan thick head that laces like crazy. taste is hops bitter IPA but then surprise bonus!!! caramel and chocolates on the back of the tongue.

Fresh pine and candied citrus notes greet the nose the second the cap pops off.  Smells good, especially if you like PNW hops.  Pours to a fluffy, off-white head on top of a ""beautiful crimson color""ed body. Clear.
Toasted malt flavors mix with tangy grapefruit and resin hop notes.  Its funny, I havent had an AleSmith beer in probably, wow......5 years??  They dont have the stuff on draught in Boston and if you only drink at bars (cut-out buying rare/expensive bottled beer for the past 5 years), you never get to drink it (and I cant open the old bottles I have because theyre worth more than my goddamned car now (just kidding, I dont have a car)).
Ahem, anyways, Ive never loved AleSmith for their hoppy offerings (crazy, Im sure) and this isnt really any different for me.  But the quality hasnt gone down, that I can tell.  Now that Ive lifted my ban on rare/expensive bottled beer, Speedway is high on my list to go try again.  Hopefully that stuff is as good as ever.
As a sidenote, the beer is filtered, which most beers that have to be shipped across the country in large number are.  I used to get pretty up-in arms about filtration, and while in a perfect world, beer should never be filtered, no matter the style, having a little more insight in to the industry allows you to appreciate that it is a necessity quite often.
So there ya go, I still enjoy going off on long tangents about nothing, in reviews.  While Ill probably never buy this again (nothing against the beer, just more a milestone (always like to try AleSmith beers that I havent before)), its nice to see this on the shelves in Boston.  And now for the numbers, which I have almost no interest in entering, for whatever reason.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The finish is equally hoppy and malty with a lingering bitterness. My kind of session beer overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

Wet dank hops with bitter hops on the back end. Nice carmel malts and a touch of candied sugar dance in and out with the hops. Just super, super hoppy. Very nice.","Indiana, USA","StFun"

Some co2 left in there, slight hiss upon opening surprisingly since about a 3rd of the bottle had escaped, leaked, evaporated or whatever.

Body is medium, a little flat on the palate, duh. Lightly oily and chewy. Well balanced flavors of malt and hops, piney, lightly grainy and bready with a bit of sweet caramel malts, orangey citrus notes also. Lasting hoppy malty finish kicked with a respectable hop bite.

A dense, foamy, cream colored head shows great retention and leaves thick, clumpy flares of ultra-sticky lacing behind.  The nose shows big pine resin hops and hints of citrus rind over a rich caramel and toasted biscuit malt, with faint hints of cocoa in the background.  Flavors are as pronounced as any amber you will ever find, yet astonishingly well balanced.  Substantial pine, citrus, and green floral hops add bitterness to counter the toasted caramel and cookie biscuit maltiness.  Medium bodied, smooth, and creamy up front, the finish lingers with dry, hoppy bitters.  This is a great, sessionable amber.

Aroma is darker than expected and this is explained in the flavor, which is Malt Central.  I detected only a slight hop profile that tasted like Christmas Tree and didnt do much to balance.  Has that bloody roundness of beef hearts, but not the flavor, just the full midpalate.  Much hoppier on cask.  Really odd beer for AleSmith.","Los Angeles, California, USA","ajm"

Appearance is a clear deep ruby amber hue with a decent amount of thin white head, moderate lacing.

Smell is sweet caramel malts mingling with green piney hops, tones of peat and wood.

Taste is dominated by caramel malts, sweet sugary peat malt, some grassy and pine hops come up, hints of vanilla, orange/citrus, and some oak chips, finishes sweet and drying.

Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, thick and smooth texture, moderate carbonation.

Drinkability is moderate, this is a well-balanced amber with plenty of flavor, definitely a lighter cousin of Evil Dead Red and Decadence, this is more reminiscent of PP Sharkbite in terms of a lower hop presence, definitely worth trying in honor of V-day!","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"

A thorough cookie dough malty base backs it up, along with a bit of english toffee.  Medium bodied, well carbonated, yet soft mouthfeel; rich and full malty texture that has some residual sweetness left, but is more of a doughy treat than a sticky mess.  The flavors are much more malt oriented than the bouquet led me to believe, bringing out more toffee and cookie dough flavors.  A hint of caramel and toasted biscuit, but not to the realm of roasty by any means.
