106,"2016-12-31",4.8,"Version à 11%. Ce cidre est dun brun cuivrée. Le nez est de caramel, de pomme-caramel, de pomme en cuisson. Tout ce qui tourne autour de ces deux éléments principaux. Ça sent bon! En bouche, cest aussi liquoreux quun Pineau des Charentes. La pomme a un second rôle dans cette espèce de concoction sirupeuse. Il y a une belle acidité qui titille la langue. Cest exquis, délicieux, cest très bon, sauf que, on a pas limpression dêtre en présence dun cidre. Récolte 2011 (2067-241216)","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","AlainG"

>>> A wonderful and unique ice cider that is extremely complex with a flavor profile very similar to some oxidized (on purpose) dessert wines. Amazing!

-  One of the darkest ice cider I have seen so far. Dark copper leaving long nice looking legs on the glass. 
-  Flavor profile is constructed around baked apples and everything else around is pushing to showcase it. 
-  Secondary flavors include well dosed spiciness (cinnamon mostly), bright red fruits notes, alcohol, and brown sugar. 
-  Its sweet, but it never gets cloying as the moderate acidity and the alcohol cut the sweetness effectively. 
-  Mouthfeel is really smooth and the mouth coating sweetness lingers for a while. 
-  Theres some oxidation / Madeira notes that are meant to be there and give this ice cider a unique profile.

Flavors:  Baked apples, cinnamon, brown sugar, oxidation notes, red fruits, alcohol, nuts, earthy notes, mild herbal presence.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

106,"2012-10-17",4.0,"«Loriginal»: une bouteille uniquement vendue sur place.  Un liquide cuivré qui nest pas filtré.  Un nez vraiment unique.  De vieilles pommes caramélisées et des pommes encore jeunes et vives.  Des notes doxydation.  Des notes de petits fruits macérés.  Une somme olfactive intéressante et qui incite mes lèvres à la précipitation.  Sur les papilles, encore une fois, diverses notes fruitées bien transformées par le temps.  Des sucres compexifiés: du caramel et son sucre brûlé, du miel et de la tire dérable.  Un alcool qui signale sa présence.  En bouche, un corps de moyenne densité et une texture qui présente une belle richesse.  Une finale sophistiquée qui comprend des pommes délicieuses avec une montagne sucrée et une certaine acidité qui finit par assécher ma bouche.  Certainement une dégustation unique.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

106,"2012-02-14",4.4,"Bottle of the 2008 vintage shared with my wife for Valentines Day.  Pours a clear tawny amber with golden ruby highlights.  Umami on the nose, rich and smooth caramel, some oxidization and age.  Quite different from most ice cider aromas, reminds me of a really good koshu we had at the 2010 RBSG, and also a bit like some old Madeira.  Velvety and smooth, big juicy apples, but theres also a hint of smoke. Chewy and thick, mouth puckering acidity, but not in a harsh way, but more of a tart green apple way.  Long lingering acidity.  Lovely and remarkably complex. The tartness sticks around for ages. So incredibly good.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

106,"2006-03-09",4.2,"Bought this right off of Christian Barthomeufs hands, hes sort of the forefather of Ice ciders, helping to develop both Face Cachée de la pomme and Domaine Pinnacle ice ciders, he finally scrounged up enough scratch to buy his own piece of land and make his own.  This was the grand finale of the ""lets piss off Clark"" tasting, but I think well end up pissing off Todd a bit more with this offering!  
Dark rich golden viscous hues, sort of like those hydrogenated palm or peanut oils.  This is a flat cider, so no bubbles or head whatsoever, and frankly it wouldnt be necessary.
Slow cooked apples, a soothing vanilla butterscotch, the alcohol feel is subtle, but gradualy picks up steam to develop interesting Calvados-like fusels.
The rich sweetness of the apple (Cortland or Spartan, not sure at all) grips you at first like getting a crate of them dumped right on your head.  The alcohol slowly creeps up next to smooth things over and dissolve some of the sugars, the finale being more a crisp, acidic tinge that is reminiscent of certain Normandy ciders, but only if you then kissed someone whos been licking on maple taffy all day.

Hes got all the basic aspects to make an upper-tier ice cider, give this guy a few years and hell really give you a Frimas-style knockout, yet for now hes still charging Neige prices.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

106,"2006-02-27",4.0,"Dark honey hue, still and oily looking though the legs are not as pronounced as many other ice ciders. Original aroma does not betray the extreme sweetness, rather hinting at orange tea, bee wax, concentrated strong apples to the point of feeling plasticy (more so because it takes into account the peel and a lot of derived alcohol than as an off-flavour). Complex in mouth if not one of the leaders in that department, it possesses enough acidity to balance the concentrated sugars, shaping into syrupy peachy, lip-smacking sweet kiss of growing apparent alcohol level. Phew, thanks Martin, a nice closure to a rough session. You will like this Todd!","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
