4497,"2012-09-15",3.2,"341mL Bottle - purchased at Depanneur Peluso - Montreal, QC. 2012. Nutty, slightly oxidized and almost hoppy aroma. Maybe Im just confusing the overall oxidation with oxidized hops. Must be that twist of cap. I have to ask though, how can a beer made this year be so noticely oxidized and old tasting? Im assuming it must be bulk aged. Oxidation can be occasionally endearing in a Barleywine or an Imperial Sout, but in this Eisbock, its just sad and wet cardboard. All that lovely malt development and crispness is handily defeated by tangy, dusty, faded oxygen-infused beer. Its kind of at a tipping point though, a few more months and this will be completely shot. Now the front end displays a brief whimper of caramels, toasted sugars, and brandy. I would like to know what this is like without oxidation.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"

4497,"2011-10-19",2.6,"Appearance: Pours an amber-brown body, good clarity, with no apparent head formation.

Smell: A simple, lightly scented trace of bready, caramelly malts, then, a bit of fruitiness and sniff of booze. Its just not particularly inviting or appealing. You just want to quietly, carefully pour it back into the bottle and dismiss it as you push it aside with your hand, moving on to something else. But, weve come this far, lets press on!

Taste: Well, huh, theres oddly very little flavor for a purported eisbock, though its no surprise after the underperforming aroma. A touch of toast, very mild, with faint hints of herbs, apricots, and tangelos. Drying, warm finish. Youre in and out in a flash, as theres not much going on in there.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Nil carbonation.

Overall: Unlike any eisbock Ive previously encountered, in that its totally lacking all the rich, complex maltiness and potent, pleasing flavors one would expect and hope for.

App.:  Very deep mahogany, clear, orange-tan head that dissipates fairly quickly.
  
Aroma:  Extremely fruity  huge mounds of raisins, figs and dates, some blueberries and other field berries, big, sticky molasses and brown sugar, very chewy and sweet (if an aroma can be chewy...), a bit like cola with some minty herbals, a touch nutty; this is a big beer.

Comments: A fun beer, a good malt monster by Quebec standards, but suffers a bit from the unavoidable comparison to the few other world-class examples.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

4497,"2007-04-08",3.3,"Bottle. Nice hazy ruby body topped with an average off-white foamy head. Good malty aroma with brown sugar notes. Alcohol is fairly well hidden. Its sweet and malty taste carries earthy and oaky hints. It ends with a bitter/sour finish. Without being an above-average Bock, this is a very drinkable beer.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
4497,"2007-04-01",3.0,"Bouteille. Arôme légèrement fumé et alcool, et plus fort un équilibre torréfié-caramel. Belle couleur rouge-cuivre, translucide, mousse qui disparait très rapidement. Goût de caramel très présent, lamertume suit de près et ensuite lalcool. Arrière-goût dalcool et damertume. Effervescence moyenne à faible, corps moyen à capiteux. Pour le prix je suis très déçu...(4.25$ pour 341ml ! )","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","Mart"
4497,"2007-03-26",3.0,"Bottle... Mostly clear ruby lager with a small, creamy, khaki head. Decent retention. Vinous, malty nose. The flavor is well-balanced, but unexciting. The alcohol is completely hidden somewhere within the glass. It feels like 9.4% ABV laying here by the pool, but doesnt at all taste like it. Unfortunately, the flavor is mostly nondescript... not unpleasant, but also not much of anything at all. Medium-bodied with lively carbonation. Tongue-numbing (local anesthetic-like), lightly bitter finish. Cheers to beerbuzzmontreal for shipping the bottle to Florida from the Great White North!","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"

Puts a dark chestnut brown lager in the chalice with ruby highlights. Hard pour puts a small 1 finger fine pored cap on the top..moderate lacing.

Aroma: Char, smoke, figs, cocoa and a wisp of fusil not overly pronounced.

Up front the big chewy cake like malts..gorgeous!!..like liquid Bundt..midpalate the wonderful Nobel variety hops show up to give that signature German herbal-woody balance to the malts...finish is long and wet...bready, chared astringency shows a bit, cocoa and woody hops..excellent finish. smooth and warming...alcohol hidden well in the profile. Decent drying in the after taste between the thick noble herbas and carred astringency of the patent malts. 

Well put together...tasteful, balanced, drinkable for a big beer but not over the top ans unbalanced like an extreme beer.

As eisbocks go this is very drinkable..not overly complex but has a character like a very mellow malty tripple bock with just enough herbal hopping to offset the big malts and keep sweetness out of the mix. 2 thumbs up!","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"
4497,"2007-03-20",3.1,"Bottle. Pour a clear red body and a dying white head. Complex but soft aroma of chocolate, caramel and toasted bread. Medium carbonation no alcohol, caramel taste but not much sweetness. Bitternes is proheminent.   Some vegetable(red peppers) notes in the finish. Quite refreshing.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","marcbé"

4497,"2007-03-11",3.6,"Bouteille de 341 ml, avec un taux de 9.4%. Couleur bourgogne foncé, pas de collet. Arome de petits pois mais le malte caramelisé le suit de très près. Goût de malte caramelisé légèrement camoufflé par lalcool, un peu fruité mais un arrière goût sec.","Boisbriand, Quebec, CANADA","Quevillon"

4497,"2005-01-15",3.4,"UPDATED: MAR 28, 2007 First batch, at the brewpub in 2005, weighing in at 8.5%abv.:
The Lure:On filtered copper and orange highlights rests a minimal but clinging head. Candied earth hints, toasted malt, minute yeast and a subtle mineral character all get along, but too discreetly.

The Festivities:Served way too cold (3-4 degrees Celsius?). Considerable caramel malt and a healthy earthy flesh are well-welded to a fine toasted malt bitterness with the help of an alcohol nibble. Aftertaste is light, body is medium-sized, nothing overwhelms and nothing much is memorable.

Transcendence:Recluse and thoughtful can be a let down when seeking pleasure.

First ever bottled batch, now called Congelator, weighing in at 9.4%abv.:
I dont know if its me, but the dark burgundy gown on this one is darker than what I remembered it to be. The round maltiness is definitely its best feature, with fruity caramel and bready notes quietly building into love handles. A hushed dryness from the supporting hops is felt. The shy nose doesnt announce the rich maltiness to come, which is disappointing. Alcohol is well-hidden for its size; this remains an enjoyable sipper within its style. Funnily enough, points are exactly the same as those of the glass I had at the brewpub two years ago.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","MartinT"
