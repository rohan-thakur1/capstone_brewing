Theres a prominent whiskey barrel presence in the aroma with subtle vanilla bean and a strong spicy rye character that overpowers the notes of the base beer. The barrel notes are really nice but thats all I can pick up until this beer warms up considerably. 

On the lighter end of medium body with a spicy whiskey barrel presence thats nicely integrated into the flavors of the base beer. The aroma is one dimensional but the flavor profile is a bit more complex. There is a lot of interesting barrel flavor with dry oak/charred wood, silky vanilla bean and toasted coconut along with spicy rye and boozy sweetness. Lots of alcohol/spirit flavor but theres little to no heat. The high ABV is nicely masked with a sweet malt backbone balancing out the rougher edges. Hints of caramel and toffee with faint hops and subtle dark fruit notes toward the finish.

698,"2015-02-13",3.1,"My Bottom Line:
This Barrel-Aged Scotch Ale is bothered by cardboard notes which surround caramel malts and the vanilla undercurrents offered by the oak.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A sheet of foam tops the turbid dark red.
-The flavor profile is unrefined.
-There is no date on the bottle, so I have no idea how old this is. But it is clearly past its peak, which is strange for such a strong brew bought in a good store.
-Carbonation is relatively low.

698,"2012-10-15",2.4,"Poured into a perfect pint.

3.0 A: Lightly hazed dark orange amber color. Not quite one finger of fizzy tan head. Retention is poor and no lacing is left.

3.0 S: Whiskey and its booziness from start to finish. Earth and mineral, leather, pie crust, slight tobacco, and plum fruitiness. Caramel and graininess from the base beer, but as far as Im concerned, the beer cant keep up with the barrel. Its not bad, but I prefer the barrel to be complementary and not the main focus.

3.0 T: Like the nose, this is all about the whiskey. Flavors mentioned above fit the bill for this section as well. The nose is mild to moderately boozy, but the alcohol is well hidden in the taste. Lots of whiskey flavors with caramel, toffee, and graininess from the base. Very faint smokiness that could come from either the beer or the whiskey.

2.5 M: Light to lighter medium body. Carbonation is on the lower side, but is okay. Too light and not creamy enough. Smooth though.

2.5 D: HF usually kills it, but this isnt very impressive. This would be a good whiskey mans beer, but it sure isnt a good beer mans beer.

698,"2012-09-21",4.7,"The whiskey barrel aging is evident before the first sip with a delightful aroma. Whiskey, vanilla, smoked peat blend extremely well. Some heat from the 8.2% ABV, but I dont think as much as the original version. Just as it should be with Scotch ales, there is little to no presence from the hops. A twinge of bitterness at the end is all that is noticeable. Incredibly smooth and really coats the mouth with a delicious layer of whiskey goodness.
