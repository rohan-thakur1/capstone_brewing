3367,"2017-03-21",4.0,"Robe blonde orangée, très limpide avant versement de la lie. Col de mousse blanc légèrement cassé, moyennement compact, stable, bonne tenue. Nez puissamment fruité, passion, mangue, résineux. Nez très gourmand, frais. Attaque vivement carbonatée, moins fruitée que le nez le suggère. Franche amertume des houblons européens en avant-plan. Les notes fruités se dévoilent plus discrètement, en filigrane sur un petit matelas biscuité. Texture huileuse, cours moyen, belle rondeur et longueur intéressante pour cette bière de soif. Lorgne franchement sur la session IPA, caractère affirmé pour une bière de soif à lamertume franche, mais maîtrisée.","Brussels, BELGIUM","SylvainCFC"
3367,"2017-01-29",3.7,"From La Ferme des Nauves :: Belgian IPA  >> Beau nez aromatique mais fluet aux senteurs de mandarine, de farine de grain de caramel, sur lie. Sa faible carbonation rélève bien le maltage doux légèrement caramélisé  biscuité aux saveurs d amaretti, et fruité à labricot. Les houblons, plus aromatiques quamérisant, rendent la gorgée grasse, quasi visqueuse: ce qui donne beaucoup de mâche à la dégustation. Finale houblonnée sur des notes dagrumes et de résine se finissant sur une sensation légèrement farineuse et sèche. Bien équilibrée et digestive. #381","Braine, BELGIUM","poech73"

3367,"2016-11-25",3.6,"I liked Tartarugas first, Super Fresca, quite a lot so Im curious to explore the new ones they have created this year. This is a session IPA (bottle from Beergium) with thick but regularly shaped, lightly lacing, off-white, moussy head with good retention (showing some gaps in the middle after a few minutes), crowning a hazy pale orange blonde beer with peachy hue and turbulent fizz. Pleasant and delicate aroma of grapefruit zest, kumquat, sweet onions, light pine resin, old orange juice, dried apricot, moist chicken spices, clove-like phenols, old bread crust, damp straw, dried field flowers and - alas - a (fortunately deeply buried) whiff of DMS (cooked green cabbage). Cleanly fruity onset, restrained hints of starfruit, tamarillo and orange with an early sign of grapefruit bitterness and a very thin but noticeable, green olive-like umami edge; fizzy carbonation but finely so, fit for this style, with a slightly souring, minerally effect. Smooth, supple body, on the thin side as can be expected from a beer below 5% ABV, grainy with a very light, softening caramelly accent, minerals continuing due to the strong carbonation, leading effortlessly to an aromatically hoppy finish, notably grapefruity with slight toasted onion-like (Simcoe) hints and a very faint whiff of orange (Cascade), but the sweet mango and passion fruit promised by the Mistral - a new Alsacian hop variety in the modern, international style - barely comes through; long-stretched, grapefruity and tonic water-like bitterness dries the back of the mouth. The DMS becomes a bit more apparent as the sediment is gradually added, and so do Belgian phenols. I am very sensitive to DMS and I dont think Belgian spicy yeast effects belong in an internationally oriented ISA, so Im afraid that no matter how much I wanted to believe in this, this does not quite achieve the same level of quality and refinement as its bigger sister. Of course, that does not take away the fact that this is a perfectly pleasant beer with a still a nice new hop profile and perfectly delivering hop bitterness for its style - I just expected it to be the best Belgian ISA so far, but it does not (yet) top Totems Cojico or even Brabants Origame 4 for me. Close contender, though, when considering the small pool of session IPAs in present-day Belgium.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"
