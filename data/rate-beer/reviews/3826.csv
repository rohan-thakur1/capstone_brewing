3826,"2016-04-30",4.1,"750 ml bottle to snifter. Looks good; a cloudy apricot with a big foamy eggshell head. Smells good too; loads of fruity hops alongside some oak and a nice tartness with a semi-sweet saison-like backbone. Some mild funk as it warms as well. Tastes like it smells with a pleasant medium-bodied mouthfeel. A well-balanced sour presence on the tongue as well. Really a dry-hopped sour, but great beer either way.","Indiana, USA","b3shine"

3826,"2015-11-12",5.0,"Ok, so ive been very lucky to have friends with access to lots of De Garde and have probably sampled well over 70 different bottles at this point. All of them have a degree of awesome, save 4-5 of them. But this one is just special. The mosaic in this beer provides the most incredible fruit character (peach, apricot, mango, passionfruit) that I have ever tasted in a beer sans-fruit. Just incredibly impressive. The funk/sour/tart level is perfect as well with a light acidity that works seamlessly with the fruity hops. I wish I had 10 more cases of this. This might be my #1 De Garde. Maybe not the most complex beer they make, but for my tastes, it is quite perfect. Thanks Tommy, Jack, Will, Steve, and others that have been so generous to share this one of a kind brewerys amazing beers with me.   P.S.  This aint no freaking saison now matter what.  But it is amazing.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","TURDFERGUSON"

3826,"2015-07-28",3.8,"How: Bottle (750 ml) at tasting. From Lurkaholic, thanks! 

>>> A good tart Saison bursting with Mosaic hops. 

+  Tons of mosaic hops, carried effectively by the sharp acidity 
+  This one isnt only plain acidic like most De Garde beers, its also nicely tart 
+  While its not really quenching like a good Saison should be, its rather easy drinking 
−  While the acidity of this one is bareable, its still a tad too much for my liking 
−  The Saison character is subdued, dont expect anything close to Saison Dupont here 
−  Poor head retention 
○  So far, I have been totally uninpressed by De Garde Bus / Imperial Bus, but their hoppy sours are usually good. The acidity (which is usually too much in their Berliner Weisse) is doing a very good job at carrying the hops aroma.

Compared to desay: nose is fruitier -- I get weeds, but I imagine theres also plenty of that tropical business I cant smell.

Bottle: The aroma consists of moderate tropical fruit, pineapple, orange, sweet tarts, and lemon. It pours a hazy.cloudy dull orange with a small white head that quickly fades to a minimal film outlined by a very fine ring. The flavor starts with moderate tart citrus, lighter pineapple, and tropical fruit. The finish has moderate tart lemon, faint lemon peel, and florals. Its light bodied with moderate spritzy carbonation. Overall, this is probably the best De Garde Ive had.","Rochester Hills, Michigan, USA","Pailhead"
