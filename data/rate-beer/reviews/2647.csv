2647,"2017-04-29",3.8,"Pours with an okay amount of white dense fluffly foam. Color is very attractive clear orange. Fresh and lightly fruity aroma has mango, some citrus, fresh hops, some sweet malt notes. Some alcohol aroma. The banana aroma is very underpronounced, which is probably a feature of filtered wheat beers. Palate is a bit dry, but the carbonation is okay. Taste is hoppy and reminds of watery pilsner more than a wheat beer. Compared to pilsners this beer is less hoppy and more malty and sweet though. The aroma is not complex, I mostly taste just hops (although the hoppiness of this is very good) and malts. There are some vanilla and chocolate notes ""in the middle"". Its surely a refreshing wheat beer and theres nothing wrong in it, but its perhaps a bit boring. Therefore its more suited for enjoying at a terrace, rather than as a complex beer sipped slowly in an armchair.","Jyväskylä, FINLAND","mviljamaa"

Nose is sweet like apple-cider, hints yeast and bread. (The wife thought it had hints of orange but that passed me by)
Mouthfeel moderate carbonation, delicate, a little thin yet leaving a light slickness. 
It's has restrained fresh flavours, upfront notes of white fruit followed by a hint of bitterness but right at the back very slight acerbic metallic taste.
Best description is it's a bottle of bubbly, a sparkling beer but needs to be more robust.

2647,"2014-01-29",3.1,"500ml Bottle from Tesco (£2.19):
Light with some wheat and faint grassy hops, almost coming across as a pale lager in places as apposed to a wheat beer. This soon passes with some citrus and light banana followed by some background malts and bread.

Clear amber to gold colour with a thumb sized head that is full of fairly large, rough looking bubbles that settle to a thing lacing on the top of the beer that starts to turn patchy.

Wheat, malts and banana start things off, with the latter coming through stronger than it did in the nose. There is some cloves, a light citrus taste and touches of bread too, plus some background fruits.

Lively with a fairly good balance and a medium body with a very slightly sticky mouthfeel. The beer was quite an easy one to drink although it did come across as a little bland in places.

Quite a strange beer initially and started almost like a pale lager with light malts and very faint grassy hops before the kristalweizen in it started to shine through.

Appearance: The body is clear, golden yellow in color and toped off with a tall loosely packed head. Most of the larger bubbles settle out quickly leaving a thin creamy covering. This holds on well and makes some slick lacing which slides right down the glass as I drink. 

Smell: Its nose is lighter than most wheat beers but offers some mild fruity wheat with light notes of clove, banana and hop spice. 

Taste/Palate: The flavor starts with a base of light grain and wheat mixed with mild notes of clove and fruity yeast. There is only a slight banana note and mild sweetness. Hops add a nice floral spice and crisp dryness to the neutral finish. On the tongue it has a fairly crisp light feel with balanced carbonation.

Appearance: The body is clear, golden yellow in color and toped off with a tall loosely packed head. Most of the larger bubbles settle out quickly leaving a thin creamy covering. This holds on well and makes some slick lacing which slides right down the glass as I drink. 

Smell: Its nose is lighter than most wheat beers but offers some mild fruity wheat with light notes of clove, banana and hop spice. 

Taste/Palate: The flavor starts with a base of light grain and wheat mixed with mild notes of clove and fruity yeast. There is only a slight banana note and mild sweetness.

Despite this being my rating #449, this is my first Kristallweizen so I have really nothing to compare it to. This is a medium golden beer with a high beautiful head, and it is actually fabulously inviting. Aroma is a dissapointment though, just grains, and I hope that this is just because it is an Erdinger. Taste is yeast, sweet, butter, sugar, straw, a bit wheat. A real quencher - I wish I had had it even cooler than already. Soft and creamy, quite like some of the wheat ales Ive had in the past.

To remove yeast and wheat protein in a process aimed only at making the beer clear - and thus looking more like a common, boring lager - seems like a bad idea to me. I get a lot of clove and banana in the nose, taste follows up in the same pattern but with an almost overwhelming clove dominance which pretty much ruins it for me. Watery mouthfeel. Its also very sweet, reminding me of some twisted form of ginger ale or something, and nowhere near the rich, wheaty, cloudy weissbier that I normally like so much. What a downer.

Taste is nicely sweet on the front of the tongue, with hops felt on the back. Opens with a bit of tartness. Maybe its the age of the bottle, but I dont get much weizen ester, perhaps a bit of clove toward the end.

I was very surprised at the head, I suppose I thought that the filtration would have a negative impact on it but it didnt at all.  Nice light crisp wheat aroma, a little bit of fruitiness, and some light vanilla.  Very light delicate and crisp flavor.  Not alot going on, but I guess that in some way thats the point.  Lightly sweet wheat with a little hay.  Mouthfeel is light bodied and thin with spritzy carbonation.  Quite refreshing and simple.  Nothing wrong with this guy, it does what it came to do.  Not a whole lot different from what many breweries pass off as an American Wheat.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Aroma was full of fruity esters, no yeast, and no spicing. Flavor was rather sweet, again, all fruity esters: apples, bananas, and pears with increasing temperature. The apples were overwhelming and this one notably lacked hefeweizen character with the filtering. Tasted almost like a golden belgian strong with no spicing. Mouthfeel was sticky, too sweet. Re-rate on draft, November 2006: Esters were more tame, this came across as a crisp pilsner type twist on a weizen based beer, good balance, a little dry, but again, crisp finish. Sure, it takes away the yeast and exciting thickness / cloudiness of a hefe, but it was a nice light beer to start the night, not nearly as fruity as from an imported bottle.

2647,"2006-04-18",3.7,"UPDATED: APR 24, 2006 Best Before 03-2006 bottle consumed on 4/13/06Filtered appearance boasts a large, yet manageable white head with a sparkling apple juice-golden colored body.  Head is well-retained, for the most part, eventually receding to cover, with light lacing.Nose smells of cereals, light white grains mainly, and some minor biscuity notes.  Not overly heavy on the banana or bubble gum and very low on clove and other spicy phenols, leading to a refreshingly simple, though moderately sweet (honey, dough) and a pinch of flowery hop notes thrown in.  No alcohol and low on the citrus esters as well.  The nose suggests, mainly, well-extracted and attenuated malts, with reserved yeast bi-products.The flavor is rather crisp up front, snappy carbonation seeing to that, with dry white grain notes, residual dextrin malts filling in slightly on the sides of the mouth.  Correct attenuation though, with just a hint of cideriness from the filtration and age, though hardly anything to complain about.  Warming allows some sweaty notes to emerge, could be old hops or lightly nutty/sourish malts.  Bananas, though dull, stick on the finish, with a bit of wateriness, but the carbonation holds up well, clearing the palate on the finish.  Low/mid gravity session, pale colored beer dont seem to suffer quite as much from filtration and this one is no exception.  I found myself expecting the worst but really not seeing too many negatives from the filtration.  Obviously mouthfeel could be more supple and there would be less wateriness and stale notes, but again, the otherwise well-extracted malts and clean yeast help mitigate this.  Though I have found Erdinger to be rather variable, so I must have got a bottle in great shape.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The aroma is lightly fruity but theres not much there to set the nostrils   twitching. Faint banana notes and bubblegum, perhaps some melon.

2647,"2005-08-23",2.5,"(500 ml bottle: $2.65) I bought this bottle on sale at a Japanese restaurant that had just taken over a German restaurant, so they were trying to unload the German beer and theres no telling how long this beer sat around (it was in a cooler, however).  Amazingly, its not all that bad.  Sweet on the tongue, with a mild bitterness and very little wheat malt flavor, this really comes across as just a basic lager to me.  The very slight cardboard flavor in the background isnt strong enough to be a distraction.  The nose is dry and very grassy, so the sweetness in the flavor really isnt reflected in the aroma.  Light to medium in body, theres enough sweetness that it stays on the palate for awhile.  Dark straw in color and slightly hazy, the steady, swift rush of carbonation bubbles helps keep the tall, bubbly, off-white head going strong throughout the session.  Lacing is sporadic, with some patches spread here and there around the glass.

Looks good on the pour, a clear light gold with a dense white head and plenty of life. On the nose while it is more attenuated in the phenols than you would expect from a hefe, there is plenty of ester (banana) there on top of a good malty foundation. The taste starts sweet and malty as expected, there is a very slight hint of the banana in the aroma, and it finishes with just the right amount of bitterness and a little toastiness. Although it is more subtle than you would expect from a hefe, this is more than made up for by the balance. The carbonation is much better than the hefe version as well, which improves the mouthfeel considerably.

Taste is similar but leans toward a European lager, oddly enough. Wheat, light fruit, straw, and some yasty notes. A bit disappointing. I rather enjoy their Hefeweizen, but this is a bit on the weak side. Body is medium with lots of bubbly carbonation. Finish is yeasty and wheaty with lighter fruit notes and some grass. Decent but poor compared to thier wheat and dunkel.","Newport News, Virginia, USA","TheBeerGod"
2647,"2003-04-11",2.4,"Clear golden body with big off-white head.  Aroma is lemony, some pear and a bit of banana.  Taste is mildly sweet wheat and apple, with some tartness.  Aftertaste is banana.  Watery palate.","Washington DC, USA","argo0"
2647,"2003-04-10",2.6,"UPDATED: JUL 31, 2016 Rerate from tap. Very light fruity, subtly hoppy aroma. Golden, a bit fizzy, medium light mouthfeel. Fairly light flavor, does not offend. Old Rating:Still yeasty aroma, togethor with a lemony nose.
Deep golden, light fluffy head.
Quite malty and full which goes well with the banana and vanilla tastenotes.
Most interresting kristallweizen so far.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","jonas"

This thin brew is held together by excessive bubbles... Maybe a nice apertif, 
before serving Walmart chips and dip. Erdinger Premium is better while costing 
the same. Typical orange, yellow lagerish color. If you want a beer with dinner,

Sweet at the start, the top is light, the finish still has a lot of sweetness, somewhat dry, lightly acidic, little hop presence, but all in all a drinkable beer, pretty middle of the road.

Little aromatic resemblance to a weiss, and not much flavor.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
2647,"2002-02-13",3.1,"Well, it looks like a lager (except the longer-lasting frothy head), smells something like a lager (muted fruit tones, but generally bitter aroma) and doesnt have the yeast. So, what to make of this beast? Well, for me it was fine, but Im sure weiss bier drinkers will claim sacrilege--the weiss has been surgically removed! The fruit taste  is there, but you have to work to savor it. But I still like it, and it tastes good. Not a memorable beer (I liked the Erdinger hefe-weizen better) but I wouldnt refuse it or knock it too much either.","Ontario, CANADA","Brian"
