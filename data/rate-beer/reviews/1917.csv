Quite hoppy to begin but this is where things started to turn for the worst, there was little else to keep me interested beyond this initial burst with the beer seeming quite flat &overly bitter with almost no sign of any carbonation.

A very good every day beer. Perfect to sit down with friends and enjoy a pint. Only big problem is that the taste varies from batch to batch. Sometimes its so good i would rate it even 17 or 18 out of 20 and sometimes tastes really shitty and not worth the 3 eur.","SLOVENIA","mlmuml"
