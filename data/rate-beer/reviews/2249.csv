2249,"2014-03-24",3.0,"Bottle at Delirium Brussels. It pours clear golden with a medium white head. The nose is sweet, tangy, apple, pear, ice tea and a touch of barnyard. The taste is tangy apple, pear, light acidic quality, barnyard, citrus peel and dried fruits (raisin etc) with a dry, tangy finish. Light-medium body and moderate carbonation. As faros go this aint too bad. As well as the sweet apple notes there is also light tartness and acidity. OK.","Croydon, Greater London, ENGLAND","Scopey"

2249,"2014-01-27",2.6,"37,5cl corked bottle, BB 02/05/14. Bought at the Tourist-Info in Brussels in November 2012  Fruity and tart in the nose, colour is reddish brown. The beer starts quite sweet. Tartness and horse blanket in the background. Highly drinkable. The mainpart is mild, smooth. Fruity woody hints together with a nice tart sourness and some horse blanket. Hints of sour apple juice. The aftertaste is long, woody, tart, sweet-sour, apples.  Nice Faro, but for me the 10% of apples in this beer is too dominant in taste. --> 9/12/8/9","Wuppertal, GERMANY","Erzengel"

2249,"2013-03-03",3.3,"Wow, fancy name (Brusselicious Lambicus). Bottle consumed at Delirium Café. The corked and caged green glass 37.5cl bottle poured out with a crystal clear copper body showing off gold edges and supporting a creamy white head of foam. The aroma offers up inviting funky barnyard that quickly mixes with sweet apple sauce and cereal graininess and coming off in a not too inviting way, that I cant really puts words to. Too contrived maybe. The taste begins with a quick little kick of sugar sweetness, apple sweetness and then heading into all too faint barnyard funkiness. It gets apple sugar sweet to midway and then a carbonation enhanced prickly dryness intercedes toward the finish. Decent but on the overly sweet side.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
2249,"2013-01-19",3.2,"375 ml bottle. 2012 vintage. BB 09/11/13. From finestshop.be.
Clear deep golden colour with tiny white head.
Aroma is rather sweet with sugar. Quite simple. 
Flavour is sugary sweetness, some fruitiness (apples and pears) and mild tartness. 
Even if this is very sweet I kind of like this. Its not mind blowing but pretty tasty anyway. Lots of pears in flavour.","Tampere, FINLAND","rosenbergh"
2249,"2012-10-06",3.4,"On tap at Delirium Tap House, Brussels.  Clear amber, headless.  Looks, smells and tastes rather like apple juice with a hint of lemon citrus and vanilla.  Perhaps some ice tea in there too.  Certainly nothing like you expect beer to taste.  Smooth and enjoyable though and some relief from the monster ABVs consumed over the last 48 hours.","Bromsgrove (via Leicester), Worcestershire, ENGLAND","foxo82"
