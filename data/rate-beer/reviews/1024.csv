1024,"2017-01-30",3.7,"On tap at Ratebeer Best. 
Aroma is interesting with some dark fruit and red wine notes: grapes, raisins, plums and prunes with hints of berry. Moderate chocolate notes with some light roast notes. Light bourbon and a bit of oak. 
Pours black with a medium small, thick, dark mocha head that recedes steadily to the edges where it lingers before disappearing. No lacing and moderately long legs. 
Flavor is similar to the aroma with a moderate fruit character including raisin, plum, prune and lighter berry notes. Moderate chocolate with medium light roast and hints of tobacco and ash. Medium bitterness. Light bourbon notes with a bit of oak. Some light alcohol spice. 
Mouthfeel is full bodied with medium carbonation. Low astringency and medium low alcohol warmth. 
Overall, not the beer I was expecting. The dark fruit was off-putting and the malt profile was a bit more muted and not as chocolate forward as I was hoping for.","Oakland, California, USA","ineedbeer"

Gold-waxed, 2014 vintage, 22 oz bottle shared by Doug. The pour on this is amazing. Dark black, thick as used oil, with a thin ring of dark brown head that fades slowly, leaving no lace. The aroma is excellent. There is a bouquet of heavy chocolate, sweet bourbon, fudge, a lovely roast, molasses, light vanilla, dark fruits Everything you want in a stout is here. Holy shit. This is just a little too forward with the bourbon. The flavor is just as incredible. The chocolate and molasses roll through a light sweet dark fruit, toasted oak, and light fudge on its way to a light vanilla finish. The bourbon presence is a little less than the nose, but its still here. The mouth feel is something else. Its heavy and thick with a soft carbonation and a lingeringly chocolate and vanilla fudgy bourbon aftertaste. This is one hell of a beer. Jesus.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"

1024,"2015-11-02",3.9,"Pours a thicker night black color, with no head at all.

Smells of scorched malts, smoothed by milk chocolate, dried raisins and rock sugar. Has a rich, wooden Bourbon quality, which blends perfectly into the malts, evoking a rich chocolate profile, with molasses and matured oak on top. Scorched qualities are quite apparent, together with the slightly spicy barrel foundation.

Has a very creamy mouthfeel, due to its non existing carbonation in combination with a big amount of whipped cream. 

Tastes of molasses from the very beginning, gently wrapped up by earth and profound malts, resulting in a balanced toffee impression. Bourbon gets then introduced by pleasant, hot oak, together with even more smoothing chocolate, this time heading into a bitter chocolate direction, reminding of alcoholic truffels. The bitterness from the chocolate turns more pungent during the finish, still soft on the palate due to the beers rich cream profile. Spicy bourbon completes the rich finish, accompanied by a dry touch, leaving the palate with a long lasting warmth, working its way slowly down the stomach.

The more the beer opens up, the more I like it, especially its finish is stellar, based on its smooth cream foundation, handling Bourbon, licorice and peaty, burned malts. Its slick licorice quality grows a bit too pungent though, amped up by the malts, resulting in a sweet sticky impression, which takes up a bit too much place on the palate.","GERMANY","aleigator"

>>>A massive, rich, complex and flawless Imperial Stout that is up there with the best but doesnt have the ""wow"" factor that come to be expected from such an hyped beer. 

+  Rich, deep and complex flavor profile
+  Balance is rather good for such a monster beer, the body is strong enough to support everything that is going on and the light soy sauce not only isnt disturbing but also gives the beer a light salty touch that help to ""lighten"" in a bit 
+  The palate is especially interesting with the full body, the oily, thick and rich mouthfeel, the mouth coating sweetness and the nice alcohol warmth in the finish along salty notes and wood spiciness 
○  While this beer is really good and on par or close with the best of the style (in fact, its really close to KBBS), it is not much different than so many very good american imperial stouts. For example, I thought the Barrel-Aged Vietnamese Speedway Stout that we had at the same tasting was much better.

1024,"2014-12-20",4.0,"(65 cl bottle courtesy of my beer saint Ryan, thanks a lot! 2013 vintage) Poured into a burgundy glass revealing pitch black body, with little to no head but a toffee rim along the side of the glass a bit like a monks hairdo. Swirling the glass leads to a little head about half a finger in height. Putting the glass at an angle reveals some fine, pearly, lace that slides down slowly. Aroma is surprisingly subdued, the initial impression being one of bourbon with an undercurrent of vanilla and syrup. Perhaps it will reveal more as it warms. Mouthfeel is oily, bordering on the creamy. Rather full-bodied and sweet without being cloying. I dont detect much carbonation, but some must be there for the head to regenerate. Flavour is predominently sweet with aroma notes and the alcohol is lethally well-marked, like an assassin. This somehow reminds me of the Funky Buddha Maple Bacon Coffee Porter except the coffee is less pronounced here.","DENMARK","humlelala"

Lots of milk chocolate upfront, creamy vanilla notes....coffee and some more coffee...what a harmony! These TG stouts have some signature sweetness that threads them all together. Maybe hints of maple syrup that permeate throughout? A medium-heavy mouthfeel that never becomes too much with the light carbonation...and just the right amount of sugars in this to cut the booze down.

Up front was enormous sweet chocolate ganache, mocha and sweet milk chocolate, vanilla, marzipan, nougat, and hints of marshmallow.

The barrell adds a subtle and measured amount of complexity and flavor to an already solidly smooth and delicious beer. Big chocolate malt flavors and sweetness. The aging gives you a nice vanilla and oak aroma. Not getting much of the coffee.

Aroma: thick soy, burnt sugars, and worn leather cohere nicely on the nose. Appearance: jet black with mocha colored foam rimming the surface. Taste: sweet raisins and bitter chocolate fade against a soft background of bourbon heat, sweet vanilla, bitter oak. Ends on a tangy/umami note. Palate: full bodied, thick and syrupy but with a surprising cola-like refreshing feel.","Alabama, USA","Dr_MedievAle"

1024,"2013-01-25",3.7,"Red Wax. Ink black beer, very thick-looking. Pours with very little head, even with a belgian pour. SMell is bourbon, crackers, fudge, port, coffee, vanilla, oak. Mouthfeel is thick.. Taste of soy sauce, burnt caramel, fudge, sugar, bourbon. It is pretty decent. A bit cloying at times.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
1024,"2012-12-17",3.8,"Bottle. Thanks to Bob for bringing this to try while we visited the brewpub! Pours a dark brown color with a slight tan head. Beer coats the glass leaving an iodine like color on the sides of the glass. Dark fruit notes in the nose with slight barrel. Molasses as well. Heavy mouthfeel. sweet dark fruit, brown sugar, slight coffee roast, and some barrel round out the flavor. Very smooth drinking. Pretty tasty and a cool ass bottle to boot.","North Carolina, USA","kbutler1"
1024,"2012-11-02",4.9,"UPDATED: JAN 8, 2013 Tap. Holy sh*t this is good. Pours opaque black with a medium deep brown head, creamy, some lacing. Aroma is chocolate, dark roasted malt, bourbon, coffee, quite intoxicating. Flavor its even better, quite sweet but not cloying, light coffee bitterness, wonderful balance between the bourbon and stout flavors, and completely masks its huge ABV even through the finish. Full bodied and silky.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
1024,"2012-08-19",4.4,"Enjoyed at GTMW 2012 from a friend met in line for the pouring of Morning Delight.  Pours a dark brown with a cream head. Smelled of chocolate and cream. Although this is a very big beer, it was smooth with cocoa and coffee flavors. Creamy aftertaste.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","rbfishstick"
1024,"2012-08-13",4.4,"Shared in line to Toppling Goliaths line at the GTMW.  This beer was fabulous.  Pitch black.  Chocolate, coffee, marshmallow, rye, and bourbon.  Delicious!  Wish I had another pour.  Awesome velvety caramelized mouthfeel.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"
1024,"2012-08-12",4.5,"Bottle as Dexters, pre-GTMW, huge thanks to Clark and the rest of the crew!  Poured inky black with a swirly dark beige head.  The aroma picked up rich chocolates, coffee, and molasses with plenty of roast to em.. subtle, complementary whiskey, black pepper, and oak accented.. rich and lovely.  The flavor found lightly-smoked dark chocolates, coffee, and maple at the core with tangy rye whiskey and oak accents.. a lot more oak and peppery whiskey over decadent malts on the long finish.  Heavy-bodied and syrupy on the palate.. buttery-smooth across the middle.. great balance.  This was most excellent!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
1024,"2012-08-12",4.0,"GTMW.  Thanks to Clark for breaking this open while I was in line.  Aroma is big with roasted malt, chocolate, brown sugar, vanilla, and marshmallow.  Light booze.  Flavor continues this theme with more roasted malt, sweet brown sugar, vanilla cream, and light whiskey/bourbon.  Roasted malt finish falls apart a bit with some acidic harshness from the coffee and a slight tinge of booze.  Big and thick on the palate.","Combined Locks, Wisconsin, USA","arkurzynski"
1024,"2012-08-10",3.8,"Bottle at Dexters Pub, pre-GTMW. Thanks to Bob for the honor of the first sample! Pours jet-black, like a mixture of week-old coffee and motor oil. Small ring of brown head. Nose is big whiskey characters, some anise, a bit of blackberry, sharp rye. Taste follows suit: big and boozy, with some licorice-infused dark chocolates, straight rye whiskey, dark fruits. Hot, oily finish. Incredibly brash, but quite the achievement.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","jlruthven"
1024,"2012-08-10",4.4,"Black pour small tan head just looks thick.  Aroma of whiskey chocolate butter more chocolate.  Huge thick mouth feel.  Flavor is chocolate whiskey butter oak and love.  This is phenominal.

1024,"2012-08-10",3.4,"Bottle at dexters. Pours jet Blake with small tan head. Aroma of dark candy sugar, molasses, candied raisins, and plums. Flavors is extremely sweet, molasses, cognac, raisins, Black cherries, caramel, coffee and subtle whiskey finish. Syrupy body. Really reminds of dark lord (when its without flaws and just a sweet brew)  and doesnt have a lot of barrel character. Pretty good and I could see sweet impy fans loving it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"
1024,"2012-07-07",4.0,"Poured an opaque black color with a brown head. Smelled of fresh date, molasses, chocolate liqueur, raisin, and anise. Full bodied and very sweet. Oily in the mouth with a light warming alcohol effect. Chocolate, anise, and dark fruit flavors. Very nice.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","GeneralGao"

1024,"2012-03-20",4.4,"22 ounce bottle courtesy of ekoerper, thanks a ton Ed!  Shared this with Preismj, following Hunahpu day, brought the bottle to the event to share, but not enough time to share with everyone due to the massive tap list.  Poured a dark slightly thick black color with a tan head.  Huge aromas of coffee, caramel, slight alcohol aroma, vanilla, and some sweet chocolate.  Flavors start out slightly bitter followed by some sweet caramel and chocolate, and then ends with a nice dose of booze in the aftertaste.  Wow, this beer was amazing, and for this to from the first bottling, I am impressed.  I am in debt to Ed for this one, he hooked me up.  Please send more!","Florida, USA","burg326"
1024,"2012-01-13",4.2,"Bottle.  Aroma: coffee, lots of caramel and chocolate, sweet and rich, a bit of an alcohol note but not terribly boozy, nice subtle whiskey/barrel character.  Pours thick as motor oil and inky black, a tan head barely breaks the surface from an aggressive pour and dissipates immediately.  Flavor: moderately high bitterness, big chewy malt character - plenty of caramel, chocolate, and roasty notes.  The barrel character is present but not overwhelming - there is a nice spicy whiskey touch to the beer.  Coffee flavors are subtle - I was hoping for more of that big espresso punch thats in the Mornin Delight, but it could be that the time in the barrel mellowed that out.  Fairly sweet finish but not cloying.  Very full body, thick and chewy, low-medium carbonation, nice smooth texture.  Very nice brew.","Iowa, USA","ekoerper"
