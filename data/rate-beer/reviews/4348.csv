4348,"2014-10-29",3.2,"I think I remember this beer being a thing. Like it was special and sought after or at least awaited by the beer geek crowd. This beer and the brewery have seem to be forgotten at this point. I picked up the beer for $1.75 for a 12oz bottle, seems like a fair price. Poured into a Blvd tulip glass. Color is dark ruby with a small head. The beer is clear but the dark color makes it look thick. Bottom of the bottle is crystal clear. To call this an English Strong Ale is a stretch, this would just be an American Strong as far as I am concerned. Its got a good deal of sweetness with lots of English tea and wet caramel biscuit. The biscuit becomes a bit burnty in the flavor as well. Lots of hops around but thankfully the bitterness is low (I loath caramel and high bitterness). This would have been very fun a decade ago.

My first impression on the aroma was green apple Jolly Ranchers (is this supposed to be ""Jolly Rancher Christmas Ale""?).. caramel and dark fruity sweetness join in.. just a touch of toffee.. but then it reverts to the candy.. bizarre!  The flavor began with a sweet and sour malty impression (brown sugar, caramel, and Jolly Ranchers) followed by some rough alcohol notes over raisins and more candy.. spicy, sweet, and warm notes on the sticky finish.. Im not sure what they were shooting for, but I wasnt feeling the heavy boozy candy.

The head is a light tan, although it mostly dissipates, leaving just a small remnant and some light lacing.

The smell is like that of a small cabin in the woods of the Pacific Northwest, stumbled upon after a walk in the rain, the fireplace heating the room and the logslight grains, caramel, light dough of baking bread, the scented woodiness of cedar.  The flavor follows suit, with a strong woody cedar flavor wrapped around a nutty, caramel base.  There is the flavor of lightly baked bread thrown in for good measure, which balances nicely against the malt and hops.

I had this with dark chocolate after dinner and the slight smoky flavor of the chocolate helped to draw out the cedar of Jolly Roger, for a great pairing of dessert and ale.  This could be a new Christmas tradition in the making.","Washington, USA","troysworktable"

4348,"2006-11-23",2.4,"Sadly, this local (Seattle) beer didnt finish highly in the Winter beer ratings my friends and I conducted. The metallic finish was the biggest problem. It starts off promisingly with a slightly sweet maltiness which gives way to a bit of hop bitterness. The aftertaste was a real turnoff though.","Seattle, Washington, USA","DrinkMoreBeer"

4348,"2006-06-17",3.7,"(12 oz bottle: Obtained 30-Nov-05 in trade with Larry Pitonka, thanks André!) Yo-Ho-Ho-ly Cow, this beer is terrific!  Right off the bat, the fruity, malty, sweet, caramel candy nose is amazing.  The candy-like, caramely maltiness carries through even more in the flavor.  Sugary and sweet (but in a quality way), a hint of butter, but balanced by a fair amount of bitter hops.  Im thinking this has a flavor profile similar to a British-style American barleywine without quite the same heaviness.  Definitely a full-bodied beer, even pushing close to the realm of syrupy.  I suppose this would seem cloying to many people, but I like dessert-like beers and wines, so Im fine with this.  Carbonation is mild.  The amber body seems hazy, but upon closer inspection, its haziness is from the small particles suspended in the beer.  Otherwise, the beer seems quite clear actually.  The small, off-white head settles to a thin ring, but not before depositing some patchy lacing near the the top of the glass.  A very solid offering that I wasnt expecting to like this much.  Will definitely have to seek out this brewery the next time Im in Seattle.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"

Sticky, not to say cloying and very badly... ""casked""??? A very poor show. They seem not to know how to handle this.

 Bottled, slightly aged, thanks to DonGS  Hazy red-foxy; rosy-amber head, small but dense, leaving some good rings.  4  Some malts in a cookie way; hops abundant all the same, and a pretty vinous character.  7  Definitely some oxydation, licorice, fruity taste - raspberry pour.  6  Despite its ABV, and malt toll, its a bit watery - the oxydation?  3  Good, but it suffered from its - relatively short - aging.  14 =  3.4","Ursel, BELGIUM","JorisPPattyn"

Pours a deep copper with a decent head. Aroma is a nice balance of warm malt, hops, and spice, but the flavor is decidedly sweet for my palate. The spice and roasted malts clash with a dose of hops that, in more modest company, would themselves pack a considerable blast. The mouthfeel is oily, sticky, and other than its density it hides its 9% very well. Not bad, but not a standout. 7/4/6/3/14=3.4

The aroma is full of whiskey, malt, cloves, earthiness, wood, bourbon and super sappiness. The flavor is much like a combination of sweetened wood and coca cola with undertones of cloves and cinnamon. After it warms a bit the vanilla in the finish also becomes a tad more pronounced. Mild levels of carbonation, somewhat prickling when cold and tongue coating in texture. Perhaps a touch of grainy roasted barley as well...strange.","Lynnwood, Washington, USA","DrunkAsASkunk"
