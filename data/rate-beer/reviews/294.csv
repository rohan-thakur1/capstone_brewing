Wet oak, dates, fig, plum, roasted nuttiness, coffe, vanilla and a splash of bourbon. Taste is just as good! Incredible balance of toffee, caramel, plum, fig with a medium-heavy body of deep roasted malts, tiny bitter hops, light coffee, leather, tobacco and earth.

Nose is sweet and very dark. Lots of dark leather and some fruity tobacco leaf. Complex dark fruit and a wonderful bitterness from earth, dark chocolate and alcohol. Figs and dates. Rich and fantastic balance considering all that is going on in this. This is quite sweet and toffee like at points, but the alcohol burn and bitterness counter very well.

XX is different in how it could almost pass as a beer of its own. The flavor is rich with caramel, chocolate, brown sugar, and booze. You dont get that juxtaposed sensation like you do with Collage 2, but this brew is no less vibrant and fascinating. While its certainly apparent theres some booze in here, this drinks remarkably easy for 13% and for being a mixture of 5 potent brews.

Had this about a week before and really liked it. Of course it was after flights at three breweries and a triple IPA. But then again all the Firestone Anniversary beers had been solid. Have high hopes for this one, hopefully in between 4.20 and 4.35.

Very dark in this place, but appeared to be dark-to-light black brown color with 2-to-3 fingers of khaki white head when I got it. Very light bubbles along the sides of the glass. Decent lacing. Decent retention. (Sight - 3.75)

Was getting wet dog to smart on the nose. Washed my hand thinking that maybe it was my hands after eating but it was still there. My wife got it too and I deemed it to be a dirty glass. I should have asked for a new one, but I didnt. Dug deep and got toffee, caramel, vanilla, oak, smooth bourbon and scotch like. Trying not to penalize the bad glass. (Smell - 4.00)

Got that Stickee Monkee on the tongue on the first taste. Also bitter milk chocolate, smooth oaky bourbon, vanilla, caramel, toffee, sticky molasses, toasted brown sugar, earthy leather and rather boozy, but in a good way. (Taste - 4.25)

Full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, warming finish. (Feel - 4.50)

Will definitely try to revisit this one once again. Still tasted very good. (Overall - 4.25)

294,"2016-12-18",4.3,"Boxed bomber. As typical with these FW Anniversary blends, I cant help but give the aroma a perfect score. Every year when I stick my nose into a glass of this, it raises up the most bigass shit-eating grin on my face. It says: this is the ultimate result of what beer can be when there are brewers as good as what FW has to offer behind the controls. It makes me positively giddy, every year. XX is no different. Aromas of chocolate, coconut, mild woodiness, raisins, toffee, vanilla, cashew brittle, and a faint sense of fermented grapes coalesce into the ultimate nose-wrecking symphony of pleasure. If I could fuck this beer without getting dirty looks, I would. Once again, as with previous vintages, the appearance is the beers biggest flaw, although Im absolutely positive that this is how they intended this beer to present itself, I cant help but think its an ugly beer. If it had a nice long-sustaining lacy mocha-colored head, Id be a lot happier. But, this is how it pours: a muddy brown hue that raises virtually no foam, let alone a proper head. Moving on to the taste, its sweet, never cloying, with flavors following the aroma, with some added licorice notes and some alcohol astringency that warms the throat all the way down to the gut. Carbonation is softer than I would like, mouthfeel is a bit sticky. Some more final thoughts before I get too drunk to type--its very alcoholic, not boozy in a cloying way, but I remember previous versions not being quite this astringent. I wish the carbonation was a bit higher. I think thats a part of what brought my taste score down from a 10. Overall, this years blend is absolutely delicious, but there have been better offerings in the series.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"

294,"2016-10-29",4.4,"Draft at Firestone XX Release Party. Nose is oaky vanilla, golden raisins, toffee, hints of bourbon and floral, with pumpernickel bread. Hazy light brown with a medium, lightly lacing beige head. Flavor is sweet and smooth, candisugar, fruity, hints of bourbon, but almost no alcohol warmth. Best version since the 13th in my opinion.","Bakersfield, California, USA","IrishBoy"
