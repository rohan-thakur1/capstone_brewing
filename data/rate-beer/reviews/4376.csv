4376,"2009-12-29",3.8,"Draft at OF.  Opaque black-brown color with an excessively large off-white head.  Smooth and chocolate centered, a very nice beer.  Lots of creamy chocolate flavor, with a very smooth body.  Easy drinking and full of flavor.  A great dark session beer.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","nuplastikk"
4376,"2009-12-28",2.5,"draft: dark black, frothy white head, aroma of malts, taste is sour, malty with a thin body, dont care for the lingering sourness from this one...edit: after reading the other ratings here I wonder if I was given the wrong beer or if there was a problem with the keg I was drinking from...","New York, New York, USA","bp"
4376,"2009-12-22",3.7,"On tap @ The Old Fashioned - Pours deep black with a small tan head. Not quite the total eclipse I was expecting, as you can see some light get through it at the edges of the glass, but dark nonetheless. There wasnt a ton on the nose, even as I let it sit for a bit. Its milky, with some sour malt and a little baking spice. Taste is nutty with some nice dryness. Bready, bitter malt on the finish, and smooth and velvety down the throat. Goes down real easy, but full enough to satisfy. Calumet continues to impress me.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
4376,"2008-03-27",3.9,"Thanks to skyview for sharing this dark pour.  Roasted malt aroma, slightly grainy in character.  Light mouthfeel with a roasted/burnt coffee malt flavor.","Roseville, Minnesota, USA","BDR"
4376,"2007-12-01",3.4,"Beer tasting at Cellars Lex/Larpenteur.  Thanks Bob (Skyview) for this treat!  Roasty notes and a nice flavor here.  Unfortunately the sample was served too cold and from a growler it was undercarbonated, which lessened the experience.  I think this would be a nice beer with the right conditions.  Glad I was able to sample.","Rochester, Minnesota, USA","tennisjoel"
4376,"2007-11-29",3.5,"UPDATED: NOV 30, 2007 Shared by Skyview.  A good schwarzbier.  Simple but good roasted aroma.  Flavor is like an oatmeal stout, with the roasted flavor the dominant character.  Rich malt, and oak in the aftertaste.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
4376,"2007-11-28",4.2,"A growler courtesy of Skyview.  Dark brown color with a medium head.  Very complex aroma of dark fruits, smoke and coffee.  Bone dry malt flavor with ample chocolate.  Slightly floral finish.  Friggin delicious.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
4376,"2007-11-23",3.9,"On draught at the brewpub in Chilton, Wisconsin. Pours a dark, near opaque, clear brown brew with a creamy and thick off-white head that slowly disipates to a fine film and off-white head. Some spotty lacing but still quite thick. Aroma of sweet black malt, toasted multi-grain malt and a touch of sweetened coffee. Taste is medium to full bodied, very light carbonation with a grainy texture. Flavors has mostly dark toasted multi-grain malt with little hop presence. Finish is slightly dry with a dark toasted malt aftertaste along with a short lived mild bitterness.","Papoose Jct, Minnesota, USA","Skyview"
4376,"2007-11-21",4.1,"From the tap at the brewery.  Pours very dark brown with a rapidly-dissipating light head and some lace.  Aroma and flavor is malts, with nice balance and not overly coffee-flavored.  A good Schwarzbier from a brewery Ill have to explore more!","Appleton, Wisconsin, USA","prosqtor"
4376,"2006-05-02",3.6,"light see through black with a minimal head. sweet nose of light roast. a bit of roast and coffee with a sugar sweetness taste. light chocolate in the finish.","Montana, USA","Kevin"
4376,"2005-12-22",4.0,"Growler.  Clear, deep mahogany with a well-retained cap of smooth toffee head.  Nose picked up a bevy of sweet, deep, dark malts... caramel, coffee, bittersweet chocolate, and some light spices were all packed in there, with floral hop highlights.  Everything really popped in the flavor... coffee was the shining star, and was complemented by dry roasted chocolate and caramel, and surrounded by floral hop bitterness.  Smooth malts pushed the brew across the palate, hoppage provided excellent bitter hints, and the finish was long and full of roasted coffee.  This stuff is fantastic, and well worth a trip out there!","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
4376,"2005-10-11",3.9,"Bobs most distinguishable beer for certain.  Borders on a dry stout.  Nice rosasted malts with coffee and chocolate profiles.    Extremely drinkable, very good.","Naperville, Illinois, USA","BCAR"
4376,"2005-03-20",3.7,"clear dark brown colour.  aorma of roasted malt, dark bread, caramel and a whiff of smoke.  the flavour was roasty and malty with some caramel and coffee flavours.  nice roasty dry finish.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","mrkimchee"
4376,"2005-03-13",3.7,"Big cheers to my Secret Santa for providing a growler of this one. Had it after a couple of weeks of sitting in the bottle and it held up very nicely.Rich brown body with a thin but creamy tan head which dissipated to pretty well nothing. Lots of roastiness and very smokey with some burnt caramel/chocolate sweetness and some coffee. A little thin perhaps and not necessarily what I expect in a schwarzbier, but solid.","Oshawa, Ontario, CANADA","beerhugger"
4376,"2005-03-07",3.8,"Growler at Fall Beerfest In Toronto 2004.  Deep brown in colour.  Aroma was quite roasty, smokey and malty.  Flavour had lots of roast, chocolate, burnt malt.  Medium body, medium carbonation.  Finishes roasty and long.  The growler held up really well.","Peterborough, Ontario, CANADA","radiomgb"
4376,"2005-01-30",3.5,"Toronto Christmas 04, Growler, dark brown, nice beige head, minimal lacing, aroma is smoky and coffee, nice taste of chocolate, coffee malt, leaves aftertaste of fruit, slightly thin.","Cleveland, Mississippi, USA","qdog"
4376,"2004-12-26",3.6,"Woody, smokey aroma, dark brown, almost no head. This tasted of coffee, with some bitter and sour fruit together,  giving the impression of an old style porter? Bitter, light bodied. Terrific, though it didnt suit the style.  Thanks to Beerhugger, via IPFreely.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","DougShoemaker"
4376,"2004-12-22",3.7,"Sampled from a growler that had been sent from Wisconsin to New York, and then driven up to Toronto, so it was nearly 10 days since it had been bottled, but it was still in remarkably good condition. Very dark brown colour with a tan head. Aroma is smoky and ropey with some old coffee notes. Body is light, Flavour is sour and smoky, like an old style porter, with coffee in the background. Very nice stuff. [Toronto Christmas Party 04]","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GregClow"
4376,"2004-12-22",3.4,"Dougs, Christmas 2004.  Dark brown colour, nice tan head.  Sour coffee aroma.  The taste is nice than the smell - reminded me of a sour old style porter with slight coffee notes.  A little watery.  Not bad.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"
4376,"2004-12-21",4.0,"Pleasant malt base with light smoky touch. Dark brown, fine creamy head. Pleasing to the eye . Flavour : plain on top  , dry roast accented   . There are some bitters , gradually dry at end . Very decent.","Toronto (Can)   Krotoszyn (Pol), POLAND","Radek Kliber"
4376,"2004-12-18",3.6,"Very dark, tan head. Very smoky, lots of malt, kind of earthy. Dry finish. Medium body, held up well all things considered, but you can tell it still suffered a bit fromt he time out of the keg. Still quite good.","Sanborn, New York, USA","IPFreely"
4376,"2004-12-16",3.6,"Very dark brown, somewhat black, w/ light brown foam. Toasty, slightly smoky aroma of dark chocolate & coffee w/ an earthy, meatiness. Full-bodied, slightly chewy feel.

4376,"2004-12-13",3.5,"Appearance from likely generous American at Doug Shoemaker Party. Very sweet with chocolate malts and who knows what to sweeten the smoke, but also bitterness at the finish.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
4376,"2004-12-12",3.3,"Thanks to whoever brought this to the Toronto Christmas Party 04.  Admittedly older growler but still in great shape.  Very dark mahogony, nice tan head.  Nose is smoky, dark roasted malts.  Rich smoky bitterness, chocolaty finish.","Buffalo, New York, USA","rudolf"
4376,"2004-12-12",3.3,"Growler at DougShoemakers.  Considering that this spent considerable time out of the keg this was a pretty decent beer.  Deep black color with a light brown head.  Coffee aromas.  Slightly bitter.  Light to medium bodied.  Flavors were coffee and roasted malt.","Alabama, USA","11026"
4376,"2004-12-12",2.7,"Pours a dark black body, big fluffy beige head. Touch of sourness hops and dark malt in the aroma. Roasty, slightly dry astringent (?) sour bitterness and some malt. Average palate, touch light. Growler @ Toronto Christmas Party 2004.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
4376,"2003-01-27",4.4,"Stoutish appearance, almost opaque, but ruby around the edges.  Nearly flat, with meager carbonation supplying a tiny ring of froth.  I've never ground up malt before, but this beer smells like what I imagine to be a tub the finest, freshly ground dark malts.  I've never encountered such an intense malt presence, save for Celebrator.  Cocoa powder, carob, and a vague cinammon smell I recall from both the Dark and Oktoberfest.  Not quite as intense on the palate, but still deliciously semi-sweet.  Light bitterness trickles in at just the right moment to slow down the malt train.  Courtesy of my good friend Tom, this is the third beer I've been able to sample from Calumet.  I've made a concerted effort not to reinforce a positive bias toward this brewery in my ratings, but I can't help but rave about these beers.  Each seem to epitomize the freshness and small-batch quality that craft brewers should strive for.  Thanks Coug.","South Bend, Indiana, USA","NDmullet"
4376,"2003-01-27",4.2,"Very sweet, malty and smooth.  This is a refreshing beer with a great toasted malt accent that finishes dry.  Great balance.  The carbonation pokes through as does the subtle bitterness that complements the sweet edge on this beer very well.","Washington DC, USA","jskendzel"
4376,"2003-01-26",4.4,"Pours slightly darker than the dark with a smooth creamy tan head covering it all.  Taste is malty, of course, and well balanced with just the right amount of hops.  Shows vinous qualities.  Could be a little thicker, but I guess it wouldn't be a schwarzbier then.  I put this in the same boat as the Calumet Dark.","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
4376,"2002-12-29",4.1,"On tap at the brewery.  THIS is the beer that IMHO should be getting the raves that the Dark is.  The maltiest, sweetest nose that Ive ever experienced, milk-chocolate and caramel and a faint floweriness.  Dark and rich and thick, with a medium-to-slightly heavy body, strong coffee flavor, excellent finish.  Best of Bobs beers if you ask me.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
4376,"2002-12-28",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 16, 2003 VERY dark, thick & rich with deep walnut brown hues.  Never had a more malty nose in my life.  Sweet caramely, chocolatey and rich.  Heavy duty!   hints of vanilla in there too.  Big time malt taste, mildly sweet, some good roasted barley presence as well.  Nice dark chocolate finish goes so well with the faint hoppiness it""s just a beautiful thing.","Richmond, Virginia, USA","GermanBrews76"
