332,"2016-11-06",4.3,"Pours a hazed orange-yellow color with a huge, fluffy white head.

Smells of dried orange peel, passionfruit, bright lemon pulp and lots of wet grass. This gets pleasantly accompanied by some water melon and wet hay, complimented by sugared bread crust. Produces a refreshing crispness, including a whiff of sweet ice bonbon atop of hand made lemonade - very nice on the nose.

Has a fantastic smooth mouthfeel, incredibly soft on the palate with a light body, producing a nice hop bite during the finish.

Tastes of lemon, white bread dough and a hop profile which turns frutier within each second. The hops bring kiwi, wet grass more lime and a mellow, sweet maltiness to the palate. The sweetness gets washed away during the finish by a late herbal dryness which inherits a powerful, slowly evolving lemon dryness, which stays on the tongue surprisingly long.

Very nice, supersmooth, light and crisp with a hoppy fruit profile, pleasantly accentuated by the malts, while turning utmost dry in the end. Very eventful and perfectly crafted, another impressive, thoughtfully balanced beer from this brewery, with a nice herbal addition.","GERMANY","aleigator"

332,"2016-03-29",4.1,"Fantastic initial big juicy hop aroma, fades a bit over time but started huge initially. Very tropical mango hop aroma. Taste brings in much more piney resinous hops, the tropical mango is still there but it takes a backseat to the piney hops. Malt is on the light side and it lets the hops shine. Really well done ipa. I wanted more of the tropical hops to come through the flavor and was slightly bummed when the piney hops ""won"" (I would say 80-20 piney to tropical hops in the flavor). But if piney is your thing this is fantastic. And really is just a well made beer. I wanted to drop it a bit from where I rated it just because I am not a huge piney resinous hop fan, but this is just so well made and ""balanced"" I could not justify dropping any part of my rating. I say ""balanced"" because it is a hop bomb, but showcases the hops so well it feels balanced. Just well done.

332,"2015-03-05",4.5,"Growler filled about a week and a half ago. Pours hazy orange, almost marigold, with one finger of large-bubbled off-white head that settles into a nice layer of lacing. Aroma is aromatic and spicy tropical fruit with dank Nelson-like notes of weed, mountain herbs, papaya, mango, durian, starfruit, peach, and riesling. Just out of control how good this smells  more or less perfect for those who like the Southern Hemisphere profile. Taste is silky mango and orange juice with some prominent white grape notes and somewhat more hard to pin down lychee-like notes, but less syrupy than most IPAs that are this fruity. Instead the second impression, after the initial tastes, is one of crispness and the pale malt base showing through with remarkable balance. Texture is impressive: silky but gulpable. I recall this beer being a favorite when I first had it, in my pre-RB days, at Blackback, and now Ill say it again: maybe my favorite Shaun Hill IPA for its tremendous balance of aromatics, boldness of flavor, crispness, and ""drinkability."" Love it.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","dfroms"

332,"2014-03-19",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2014 Draught at Three Penny Tap Room, 3/15/14Rosy-amber colored body has a light haziness to it and a firm white head that is well-retained.Incredibly aromatic nose is bursting with soft, juicy, bright hops. Tons of juicy tropical fruit notes (mango, peach, lychee, pineapple) and a perfect amount of balancing malt sweetness (light pale malt sugars). Wonderfully fragrant and 100% free of pine sap, resin, alcohol or citrus rind-like astringency. Very clean, as well.Flavor is equally devoid of any pine-like astringency. Acids never build up on the palate, leaving only delicious, light, yet vibrant hop flavors on the palate; ruby red grapefruit, mango, lime, lychee...Malt is lightly sweet giving your basic honey-like flavors.  Carbonation is fairly engaging, though there was a touch of wateriness in the beer and I could actually see it benefiting from a little more attenuation.  I honestly love the relative lack of bitterness here.  I wish more IPAs were like that.  I do, however, feel that in turn, the beer needs to be pretty near bone-dry when there arent as many bittering hops to balance the malts.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

A deeper richer golden yellow than the pale ales sharing the lineup, same haziness, same gorgeous head. The hop profile shows a greater tropical fruit presence, with a sweetness the is more melon than papaya, matched to grapefruit and guava. No oiliness, just clean bright hop character ending in bitterness of decent but not overwhelming length. Once again, the beauty lies in the malt balance. This IPA did not forge new territory in a tactile or flavour sense, but it did demonstrate how perfect balance can create a new awareness and a greater clarity of what an IPA should be, as opposed to just showing up as another hop bomb.

332,"2013-03-15",4.4,"In short: A kickass aromatic pale IPA.  That simple.
How: Growler 750ml, consumed fresh a few hours after purchase at the brewery.
The look: Cloudy amber-orange body topped by a medium white head with medium retention and leaving lots of lacings on the glass.
In long: The highly aromatic nose is a pure bouquet of tropical fruits over a bed of flowers.  Taste has the typical Hill Farmstead IPA malt backbone, full, bready, crackery, light notes of soft caramel  This one seems to be using a bit more caramel malts than many of their single-ipa lineup (almost zero caramel in those) but a bit less than in their flagship Edward.  Hopping is dominant but never aggressive, lots of tropical fruits, nice floral character, some grapefruits, light coniferous notes.  This is once again HF being HF, pushing strong in the aromas department, keeping it simple, focus on high drinkability more than high intensity.  This one is near the top of their kick-ass IPA lineup.  If I had to choose between world peace and an unlimited supply of Hill Farmstead Id be faced with a difficult dilemma, start each day with an Hill Farmstead IPA or with a Hill Farmstead Saison?","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

Hoppy aroma with some fruitiness, citrus orange and acidic lemon.  This was nicely balanced and finished clean.  A very well done IPA, wow amazing.","Bourbon County, Minnesota, USA","ryanfolty"
332,"2012-12-15",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 30, 2013 Bottle - thanks Folty! Bright neon yellow pour with a white head. Very citrusy and sweet - Darcy Folty says peach, Daddy Folty says lemon - both are correct. Excellent brew.","Plymouth, Minnesota, USA","BVery"

Nice.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"
332,"2012-12-12",4.5,"Holy intense aroma! The nose on this is redonk! Immense blast of grapefruit, citrus, mango and pine. This is a fruity, yet dank IPA! The malt balance is also exceptional and even apparent on the nose. Im thinking there may be some malted rye in this, as I get almost a spicy/rustic malt presence from the aroma. Appearance is a murky copper color with a nice white creamy head. Taste is spot on - grapefruit, tropical fruits, citrus, pine and dank marijuana-like herbals. This also has a great mouthfeel - perfect carbonation for the style yet full bodied. This is extremely well balanced and it shows. This might be one of my favorite IPAs to date.","Seattle, Washington, USA","julian"
332,"2012-12-05",3.8,"Draft at WLV for Zwanze Day 2012. Pours very attractive, deep orange-gold with a sticky white head. Nose is big on hops but somewhat generic. Lacks the pop youd expect from the hops chosen. Grapefruit and resin, faint tropical note. Stiff malt component as well. On tasting, faint sweetness, firm bitterness overall. Hop flavor sticks with citrus and a hint of marmalade. Dry finish. Very well crafted IPA but lacks something to make it pop. Id drink a ton of this if it were available but its not in my top 10...","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
332,"2012-12-04",3.9,"Sampled at Zwanze Day - 2012 (Chicago, IL). Pours a richly hazy pour, darker golden amber pour, richer haze, mellow deep dark murky glow on the edges. Frothy offwhite head laces well atop, firm layer overall. Lingers. Aromas are rich grapefruit, lemon, and florals. Rich hop aroma as it settles, some melon and kisses of tropical fruit. Rich hop presence is intoxicating. Initial is lighter end of the fold with firm bitterness, bigger grapefruit and floral elements. Some grass, kiss of pine. Gentle melon and tropical fruit. Bready malts, grains. Middle is richly bitter, big citrus and bitter resiny elements. Backend shows dryness, grapefruit, florals. Some bread, grain, richly bitter elements jump in and out. Finish is lingering trailing florals, resin, and citrus. Light and airy at times, richly hoppy. Solid fresh hop offering. I wouldnt call it the most complex one, but its very good.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
332,"2012-12-04",4.1,"Growler. Pours a deep golden hazy orange with medium white head. Aroma is pineapple, grapefruit and some hop. Taste is a very well balanced, grapefruit bitterness at the front, no real sweetness, more tropical fruits and finishes extremely dry.  A very well crafted single IPA that showcase the simcoe and citra.","Morro Bay via Orange County, California, USA","thome50"
332,"2012-12-04",4.2,"Pour from a growler at home gave a characteristic HF color of murky gold orange. Aromas of fruit, flowers,  and yeast. Flavors are exceptionally luscious with the tropical pineapple, mango of the Citra and Riwaka, and the characteristic Simcoe floral citrus. Just moderately bitter and fairly dry finish. Long retention of flavors on your palate. Really great beer.","encinitas, California, USA","nightrider"
332,"2012-12-02",3.8,"On tap at the Prohibition Pig in Waterbury.  Hazy golden yellow body, moderate white head, decent lacing.  Nose is a blend of mild grapefruit, pine, and orange.  Pleasant, but not particularly aromatic.  Flavor is similar in complexion, but the beers mild character plays better on the tongue.  Medium bodied, appropriately carbonated, refreshing bitter finish.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"

332,"2012-12-02",4.1,"Enjoyed on tap at Zwanze Day, 2012. Served in a my Zwanze taster.

A: Pours a cloudy apricot color with a frothy off white head forming on the pour. It recedes slowly to a thick ring and leaves some soapy lace down the glass.

S: Very fruit forward nose. Very intoxicating mix of peach, pineapple, apricot and stone fruit. slightly grassy with a sweet biscuit malt backbone. 

T: The malt base is a little heavier in the taste. Biscuit and toffee with sweet bursts of pineapple and peach.

M: Medium to light bodied with a nice medium-high carbonation level. Fruity and sweet flavors left on the palate.

O: High drinkable with a great fruit forward nose and taste. Definitely enjoyed this one!

332,"2012-11-26",4.5,"750mL growler, sent from Glouglouburp (thanks a lot, Dany!), pours a cloudy, completely opaque, dulled orange with a medium white head. Aromatics are incredibly orgasmic, like all Hill Farmstead hoppy beers, with loads of orange peels, mangos, peaches, truckloads of resinous hops and a big caramel malt backbone. Flavour brings out loads of tropical fruits (mangos, peaches and pineapple), juicy mandarin oranges, bitter grapefruit, and truckloads of resinous hops. Flavours are incredibly rich and deep somehow for only being 6.2% (I would guess this was more like 9% due to the flavour depth, not because of any boozy quality). Finishes quite bitter, on the grapefruity notes. Extremely refreshing and again, immensely flavourful. Must be the best non-Imperial IPA Ive had. Most amazing.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
332,"2012-11-26",4.2,"Growlerette filled at the source two days ago.
Pours a cloudy murky light yellow golden color with a decent sized bone white head that slowly fades to a smattering of lace. That aroma is intoxicating, literally! Wiked old school citrus of grapefruit, orange, and lemon with pine with hints of resin. If theres malt in there I cant smell it, but shit I dont miss it, Ive got a hop chubby. The flavor does hold some light bready malt but the citrus hop flavor is the dominatrix to my taste buds. Grapefruit, tropical fruits, tangerines, pine, resin its all there and it all melds together wonderfully. Smooth never harsh bitterness provides balance to the little malt I can find. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a smooth resinous mouthfeel. It doesnt look like much in the glass, but thats a damn fine beer right there.","Bedford, New Hampshire, USA","johnnnniee"

Huge grapefruit, mango, a touch of pine, grass, orange peel, and tangerines in the aroma. Like a glass full of sweet, fresh-squeezed fruit juice. Taste is sweet pineapples, mango, grapefruit peel, orange juice, resin, tangerines, and papaya with a big bitter finish. Medium mouthfeel with high carbonation. Super tropical and one of the fruitiest IPAs I have ever tasted with huge bitterness; literally tastes like a glass full of freshly squeezed grapefruit juice.

Grapefruit and green peppers seem to be at the forefront, followed by orange, lemon and a little bit of hay... farmy. Smells fantastic. Taste follows, grapefruit seeming to be the highlight. Very mild bitterness, and a dry finish.

332,"2012-11-24",4.3,"Growler sample via and shared with oakbluff. Murky pale orange in colour with medium carbonation. Aromas are of tangerine, papaya, hop sack, and a touch of pale malt. Great flavors of juicy whte grapefruit, mandarin orange, and weeds, balanced out by just enough crispy pale malts. Sharp clean bitterness, and refreshingly light bodied. A world class IPA.","Winnipeg, Manitoba, CANADA","piscator34"
332,"2012-11-24",4.2,"Flip top bottle from chouffe.  Hazy dark gold color with a thick fluffy off-white head.  Plenty clings to the glass after each sip.  The aroma definitely showcases a tropical fruit theme; grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, and lemon zest.  Some herbal character mingles in with light biscuity notes.  Not unexpected, theres lots of tropical fruit, citrus rind, and earthy hop flavors.  But theres also some assertive pine towards the back end.  The finish is mostly dry with crisp bitterness and just a little lingering sticky sweetness.  The body is sturdy, perhaps a shade heavier than expected, but slick and easy going down.  Although Id say this drinks a tick stronger than it really is.  The Society & Solitude #5 I had the other day is better than this one but this could definitely be a sibling to it.  Another very fine IPA from Hill Farmstead.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

Pours a rather hazy golden amber with a medium sized white head.  Big succulent citrus and hops on the nose, dripping with resinous hops, beautiful.  Medium bodied, big bold citrus and pungent earthy grapefruit comes through right away.  Picks up a bit of sweetness and a bit of warming alcohol.  Long spicy and pithy grapefruit and a long lengthy bitterness with some warming alcohol on the finish.  Another amazing IPA from Shaun and company.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

332,"2012-11-20",4.5,"Draft at Farmhouse in Burlington- thanks to Jeff for having this one on tap for my visit! Pours a lovely hazy orange with that classic dense, gorgeous frothy white Hill Farmstead head. Nose brings a stunning initial hit of grapefruit rind, both more bitter white zest character with sweeter pink flesh flavor, along with tangerine, clementine, apricot, honeydew, and assertive pine. The flavor continues to bring wave after wave of immensely flavorful citrus backed by subtle but beautifully bittering evergreen and balancing nectar fruit sweetness. The mouthfeel is just full enough, but beautifully drinkable with a lasting bitterness that almost seems to provide a 5 second respite causing the facade of a smooth finish, then attacking you again for that lingering hop bite. An absolutely stunning lower alcohol IPA; could be my favorite.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"

332,"2012-11-18",4.6,"On tap at Blind Tiger.  Kicked in about 25-30 minutes.  A damn fine IPA.  Has Heady like qualities with regard to aroma and taste.  Obviously lighter on mouthfeel.  Pours a pale hazy orange color with fluffy white head.  Aroma is just wonderful.  Grapefruit forward.  Like diving into an orchard.  Has a heavier feel for straight IPA.

So much grapefruit citrus, tropical pineapple, butter, caramel, and cheese, pine and lots of tropical notes. Awesome mouthfeel, so sweet and refreshing with a nice hop bitter finish at the end. Highlight of the event for me. If it was a little more dry and citrus dominant it would have been epic. Maybe a little too much sugar left behind but still world class.

332,"2012-11-16",4.7,"On tap at the Brewery. The pour is mega hazy straw with a perfect creamy head that lasts throughout the glass. The aroma holds explosive citrus and nectar fruit- think tangerine, mandarin orange, and apricot with an assertive background of orange peel and clementine. Hints of green pepper that I also got from the Riwaka single hop and Cantillon Mamouche- not unpleasant whatsoever, and super interesting. The flavor bursts with orange and juicy nectar fruit, leaving hints of pine, and finishing with a very strong grapefruit juice character. The palate is quenching and bone dry in the finish with fluffy meringue like carbonation that provokes an immediate and viscerally compulsory followup gulp. A near perfect ipa for my tastes...","New Hampshire, USA","oteyj"
332,"2012-11-15",4.3,"Tap.  Aroma is focused on citrus hops, bold mango and grapefruit jump out of the glass, some pine and resin.  Nice malt in the nose as well, bread, some toast, and notes of honey.  Pours hazy golden, thick white head has good retention and laces nicely.  Flavor is a fantastic balance of hops and malt.  Big burst of hops, lots dank grapefruit and tropical fruit, bitterness is high up front but integrates nicely as the malt flavors come in.  Honey and biscuit malt meld well with the hop charge.  Medium body and carbonation, smooth and drinkable.  Excellent.","Iowa, USA","ekoerper"
332,"2012-11-14",4.6,"On tap at Hill Farmstead Brewery and again out of a 750ML Growler in an HFS tulip at around 50 Degrees F. 

A - Bright and cloudy. Unfiltered and full of gorgeous complexity as a super intense orange color. 3 Fingers of fluffy white head that seems to never go away at least over 5 minutes. Very resilient lacing on the swish and subsequent fiddling with the glass. 

S - Citra hops dominate the nose. Huge grapefruit, tangerine and lime scents. Its a citrus bomb with a hint of pine in the back of my throat. 

T - Huge hop bitterness strikes first. Like Abner or Society 3, the huge citrus notes fill the mouth aided by a big and generous carbonation that is 2nd only to soda in the way the bubbles tingle and fill your mouth and keep on tingling. Huge level of fresh whole oranges juiced into a glass ice cold and refreshing. There is a chewy hop bitterness of pine needles and grapefruit with pineapple. 

M - Medium body but a mouth drying carbonation. Its not high carbonation but its how the carbonation interacts with the flavors to make the beer better. Susan on cask would simply not be the same. The small level of CO2 makes this beer so much better. Everything is accentuated. 

O - This is an exceptionally well balanced beer for being so bitter. Every last drop was perfect. i was the first person on RB to review Society & Solitude #5. I gave that beer a 4.8 and, having both of these beers side by side tonight, I stand by that SC5 review. This beer is NOT the same as SC5 but its still delicious and drinkable. I wont give it a 4.8 but its damn close. Great job, Shaun!","Enfield, New Hampshire, USA","AdamChandler"
