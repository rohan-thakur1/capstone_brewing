2596,"2016-12-06",3.4,"Bottle, picked up in La Crescent. POurs clear orange, medium off-white head, dissipates fairly slowly, good lacing. Aroma is grass, very herbal, juniper, lemon. Flavor is medium sweet, light bitter, honey, herbal, juniper. Medium body, high carbonation. Interesting, not sure if that means good or not.","Sunnyvale, California, USA","bytemesis"
2596,"2015-10-31",2.7,"This is a corked, 750 mL curvaceous bottle supplied by Stine; and received only moments ago via timely postal carrier. The Rollingstone city council (Rollingstone, MN) should invite The Rolling Stones to play at Legends Sports & Bar. Actually, the name for this seriously small city of thiers isnt THAT funny. Its unique. Ill leave it at that.  The pour is an unclean (not due to an infection; cloudy) murky carrot orange, producing one of the slimmest of light ale heads Ive seen in a very long while: razor-thin fingernail-sized off-white presentation: this carbonative necessity stood blandly for approximately 4 seconds before shriveling up and disappearing from the surface area almost entirely.  It has curious aromas of stale lemonade, banana skins, crushed coriander, a touch of spelt flour, cotton, and the briefest hints of underripe juniper. Startlingly diminutive for the amount of yeast detected. The flavors are practically identical to its aromas, with the addition of bubblegum, caramel, and sour grass, Strangely sweet: kind of weirdly honeyed, experienced most prominently at swallow. This candied irritant was like if you, for whatever reason, decided to microwave clover honey for a half hour, then scooping it up and dumping it in an iced herbal tea.  Oh, and I should probably also mention that this baby is hot as hell and doesnt hide it (if you catch my drift). I felt unusually smashed after just three swigs. I mean, if the ass-kicking acohol content can be attractively concealed, then go for it, but this Saison-base traditional may need some pointers on this, sorry.  Papery, thin mouthfeel. Farm Breweries (I.E. breweries that either own a farm or brew beers on the premises if farms) are not always guaranteed to give you that oh-so desired authentic taste and fluffiness from their farmhouse ales. Ive learned this the hard way.","Massachusetts, USA","radarsock"
2596,"2014-09-16",3.4,"Bottle... Clear amber pour with a small creamy, white head. Fantastic retention. The nose is restrained, but Im able to pull light notes of juniper and honey from my glass. Full-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and laid-back carbonation. Tastes like a honey and sorghum beer. Theres a trace of molasses here. Trends sweet, but not cloying. An odd and interesting beer.

2596,"2013-09-29",3.8,"Well, you just cant mistake the juniper here. Its front and center and in proportions enough to please James Bond or other gin & tonic drinkers. But there is a delicate balance here that is really tremendous. This beer screams out with authenticity, as if a farmer brewed it to an old recipe--theres an earthy, natural, balanced flavor to complement the juniper. Really good.

2596,"2013-07-15",3.8,"750mL bottle, 2013 vintage. Poured orangey-golden with a thick, dense, well-retained off-white head.. looked great! The aroma picked up bitter orange peel, strawberry, juniper, and a touch of rye over honey and sweet bready malts.. big and warm on the back of the nose.. maybe a touch heavy-handed, but it was very interesting. The flavor found honey and sweeter bready notes at the core, with lightly-tart juniper berries, toasted rye, a bit of oak, and peppery notes around.. finished very dry with lightly sour berries and peppered oak over honey. Medium-bodied and well-carbonated.. the berries kept it tangy and engaging.. a little busy at times, but very interesting and tasty.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"

Initial is medium bodied, firm apple and estery fruit, touches of biscuit, toast, and gentle carmelization. Touches of peanuts, gentle yeast, touches of pine. An odd brew.

2596,"2012-06-02",4.2,"Just picked this brand new beer up from Zipps. Joe Pond has surely proven his brewing capabilities by now, I hope this one holds up to the standard that hes set for himself. Poured from 750ml swing top to tulip:

Pours a deep, hazy pear/gold with a swelling soft white head. Precise lacing and moderate, consistent beading. Really a gorgeous beer to look at.

Youll know by the nose that he wasnt stingy with the juniper. Bright juniper notes supported with big yeast, clove, banana, some nutty bits, spicy cereal malts. Lovely, fresh, complex.

The nose gave me high hopes that the flavors surpassed. Id have to guess that Aurochs Horn is the base beer here. It seems like the juniper really beefs up the beer. Some bitter, malty caramel are thrown into the mix. Sweet bread. Sort of a tangy finish thats hard to dissect.

Overall, this is exactly what I was hoping for. This guy really knows how to brew great beer. I hope he does big things but, at the same time, I wish he would just keep doing his thing because he really has a knack for this.","Orono, Minnesota, USA","FURLYSURIOUS"

2596,"2012-05-17",3.7,"(bottle) Pours a very, very hazy orange color with a large off-white head that possesses a shaving cream like consistency and retains very well.  The aroma has up front some graham cracker, but the juniper shines through as well.  Further warming opens up some fruit character such as pineapple and canned lychee.  Peaches as well and further on some funk and earthiness makes an appearance.  Pretty complex scent, but everything is very dialed down.  The flavor is reminiscent of canned yellow peach juice, light pineapple juice, and banana, which quickly morphs to a faintly herbal and a dry, crackery finish.  Really digging the flavor.  Mouthfeel is a little thicker than expected, and carbonation is soft.  Overall this is a solid beer, but didnt quite meet my expectations.  It appears there are some funky elements lurking within this beer, so I may need to purchase another for aging.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"
