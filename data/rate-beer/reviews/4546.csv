4546,"2012-07-24",4.2,"Pours clear straw yellow in color with a big creamy white head. The aroma ujs light and sweet, almost a bit of warming orange with notes of syrupy honey soft and pleasant. The flavors brings the bitter Saaz hops at first which then settle with a pleasant sweetness, moreso than some of the other pilsners which I thoroughly enjoyed.","Royersford, Pennsylvania, USA","Damico"
4546,"2012-07-10",3.7,"Clear golden with a small white head. Lightly sweet malt, a hint of citrus and herbal notes in the aroma. Medium to thin body. Flavor is light. A bit of toasty malt, zesty bright citrus. Not a lot of flavor but pleasant. Crisp finish. Great summer beer.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
4546,"2012-07-10",3.2,"Seems this one is out of retirement...draft at Station.  Pours a clear pale yellow with a minimal white head.  Aroma is lightly soapy and has a light, sweet maltiness.  Flavor is grassy with a touch of spicy hop notes...still some sweet maltiness.  Mouthfeel is light/medium with a grassy finish.  Decent but not hoppy enough for my tastes...too much sweet maltiness.","The dub c, Pennsylvania, USA","reggiedunlop"

4546,"2009-01-14",4.1,"This is definitely one of the best pils Ive ever had.  From start to finish, this one has it all!  The beer pours a beautiful and clear golden color with a generious white head.  There isnt much lacing left around the glass, though.  The aroma is full of flowery hops, grains and a subtle touch of sweet malts.  The body is incredibly smooth, clean and drinkable.  The flavors are crisp and very well-balanced.  The hop character in this pils is astounding, and there is the perfect amount of malt to provide a clean and balanced backbone.  The finish is quite dry, hoppy and refreshing.  This would be an outstanding beer to enjoy after working outdoors in the summer or out on the beach.  This is one damn good pilsener!","Pottstown, Pennsylvania, USA","obxdude10"
4546,"2009-01-10",3.8,"Draught at Phoenixville BrewPub:  Aroma of noble hops, Saaz, slight grains, and Pils malts.  Poured golden in color with a medium-sized, rocky, loose, off-white head that greatly diminished.  Clear.  Slightly sparkling.  Small lacing.  Flavor was lightly sweet and light to medium bitter.  Tastes of slight lemon, Saaz hops, Pils malts, and some grass.  Light to medium body.  Dry, mineral-like texture.  Average carbonation.  Bitter, Saaz-hop finish.  A very nice Bohemian Pilsner.  Better than the Pikeland Pills.  I hope they bottle this one.","King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, USA","michael-pollack"
4546,"2009-01-09",3.7,"Tap at Rford.  Pours a translucent golden with a small bubbly white head.  Aroma of lemon, floral, doughy, grassy and spicy noble hops.  Flavor of pine, cereal grains, noble hops, lots of hop bitterness, bready malt.  Really solid, crisp pils.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
4546,"2005-10-04",3.6,"UPDATED: OCT 21, 2005 GABF 2005. Bright lemony body with visible fine, pale particles and a clean, foamy white head. Aroma of lemon citrus, hay, and fresh wheaty grain. Big blast of fresh hops in the flavor with some light malt backing. No detectable diacetyl. I would be hard-pressed to distinguish it from the Pikeland Pils. Still, this is another good session pils from Sly Fox.","North Wales, Pennsylvania, USA","whaleman"
4546,"2005-09-11",3.6,"On tap at the Royersford location. Poured a medium golden color with an averaged sized white head. Aromas of fresh cut grash with some malts. Tastes of grass, sweet malts with some light citrus. Grass was heavier in aroma than the tastes. Had a nice medium malty sweetness to it. The bartender gave me a sample of the Pikeland Pils to compare side by side. I found this one tastier and crisper than the Pikeland Pils.","Lansdale, Pennsylvania, USA","hopdog"
4546,"2005-08-25",3.4,"Ive never been to Prague but imagine this Bohemian Pilsner would be welcome in the pubs there.    Hop aroma, fuzzy golden color with pillow head.    This is a straight forward crisp pilsner with ample Czech flavor thanks to the Saaz hops.","Glenside, Pennsylvania, USA","JFGrind"
4546,"2005-08-22",3.8,"Pours gold with a light, frothy white head.  The aroma is lemony hops and citrus, and some spice.  Nice flavor profile with citrus, hops, some malt at the finish.  The finish is crisp and semi dry.","Lower Pottsgrove, Pennsylvania, USA","DocLock"
4546,"2005-08-11",3.9,"Poured a golden color with a small, white head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of grass, citrus hops, light toffee malts, and toasted dough.  Taste of juicy, lemony citrus, grass, and herbs, while finishing doughy, with a bitter dry finish.  This is a tasty pilsener!","Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, USA","egajdzis"
