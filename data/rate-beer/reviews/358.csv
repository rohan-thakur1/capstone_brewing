No shortage of carb, and it probably was a bit disturbed by me carrying it back to Brussels. Aroma of green apple, apple skin, damp basement, a little citrus peel, dried herbs, pretty woody (Girardin there?) with some tannins on the nose, maybe light phenols. Flavour is smooth but not particularly punchy. Lemon, lime and a little orange juice, acidity is light and lactic. A bit of apple skin, citrus pith, light dry grass. Finish has woody tannins, a bit of dry grassy medicinal hops, soft lingering fruit. Medium mouthfeel with light carb remaining. Nice balanced gueuze albeit a little restrained and anonymous.

358,"2014-07-24",4.2,"UPDATED: FEB 28, 2015 Fully traditional gueuze (oude geuze) made especially for the 20th anniversary of Belgiums best-known beer restaurant, De Heeren Van Liedekercke, with lambic from Lindemans and Girardin.

The complex smell of all good things in oude geuze: some sulphur already present, lemon zest, sour cream, hay, green apple, horseblanket, rose petals, old sherry, sweat... Fresh citrussy onset in the mouth with hints of wine vinegar and wheat, dry acidity with the soft, smooth rounded, mals effect that typifies both the Girardin and Lindemans lambics, finish lightly bitter, dry, very complex and very long, as is custom in this genre.

A: Opening bottle of this damn near killed me, so look out. Pours with a massive foamy head that settles into something more appropriate. Color is cloudy straw-orange.

N: Oak, light sourness, ginger, and lemon zest. Lots of wood in this. Measurable level of funk and plenty of leather. Some bleu cheese and sulphuric acid. Perhaps not as complex as the big boys, but the flavors are assertive. 

T: More of the denseness from the oak, and its plenty sour with a slight malt sweetness to round out the edges. Has some sharp acid which comes and goes and detracts from the experience when its there. Appropriate level of doughiness. 

M: Very dry and clean. Light bodied and well carbonated.

3.5 T: Again super funky. Apple and especially apple orchard earthiness. Rotting log, dry-rot, musty basement, stale bread, and sweat. Not as cheesy as the nose. Again, acidity is quite low with minor lactic acid and basically no acetic. Oak with a moderate tannin component.

3.5 M: Lighter body. Good gueuze-level carbonation. Lacking creaminess though.

3.5 D: Decent beer, but certainly not worth the price. Im glad I didnt get an extra to age. I will say that this is a funk lovers dream. Theres tons of it. For me, I would have preferred a bit more acidity and a bit more sweetness. This is dry even for a gueuze.

S - This one is funky through and through. Once the funk dies down a bit you can detect some fresh cut grass, oak, funky cheese, some fresh cut citric fruit and a dash of sulfur.

T - Starts off with a bit of sour lemon zest quickly giving way to hints of the typical barn yard funk, blue cheese, oak and some dry maltiness. The sometimes prickly carbonation really doesnt help this one. Finish is pretty dry, lingering for quite awhile after consumption.

M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Not as tart as I was expecting with a dry finish. A touch too much carbonation as well.

O - This one was pretty good. It really didnt have any glaring flaws but when we where drinking some of the best gueuzes on the pallet it really didnt shine either.","Pennsylvania, USA","orangesol"

358,"2012-01-16",3.7,"Sampled at STLWills 30th b-day tasting.  I may have rated this one higher if I had it on its own instead of being in the middle of so many excellent other beers.  Pours clear amber/orange with an off-white head.  The aroma is citrusy, clean and a bit maltiness than most lambics with some pale and caramel malt on the nose.  Medium / light crisp body with mild semi-sharp carbonation.  The taste is very tart and sour with apricot and some vinegar and lots of fruitiness.  There are some medicinal traits and aspirin along with an alcohol taste that seems odd for a 6.5% beer.  This is decent, but not up to the standards of others in the tasting tonight.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
358,"2012-01-09",3.7,"750 ml bottle sampled at STLWills 30th birthday party- thanks again! Pours a clear, bright gold color with rising bubbles and a big white head. Aroma of bready funk, bright citrus, herbs, straw, white grapes, and something plastic-like. Flavor of grass, lemon, herbs, banryard funk, and earth. Light-bodied, with a tart, dry mouthfeel and medium-high carbonation. Not bad, but didnt stand up to the others opened that night.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

358,"2011-12-12",3.8,"750mL thanks to Travlr. The pour is a hazy peach with riveting carbonation producing a thick, white head. Nose is a little one dimensional- subtle sulfur but big lemon peel and grass. Subtle must and cheesy funk. Taste is sharp sour, lemon citric, lighter feeling with powerful grapefruit presence. Effervescent palate. Decent geuze for now that needs a lot more age before the Girardin complexity kicks in.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"

358,"2011-12-10",4.1,"UPDATED: JUN 7, 2012 750ml bottle opened 12/3/2011
A: A massive, billowy white head crowns a clear, golden-orange body marked by vibrant carbonation.  Streaks of foam left with each sip.
S: Assertive lemon, green grapes, and orange notes.  Soft musty oak and earth.  There is no doubt about Girardins influence in the blend.
T: Like the nose there is a nice bright citric and green grape component.  However, tha subtle mineral quality that great Girardin vintages have, starts to come though towards the end.  Light wet hay and musty oak rounds things out.
M: Medium carbonation, aggressive carbonation, moderate acidity and mild, crisp, sourness in the finish.
O: All said, I am really looking forward to this aging.  Its young still, and the fact that its a 1 & 2 year blend is evident in the nose.  I think time will do wonders to this beer, particularly in the nose.","Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","callmemickey"
358,"2011-12-06",4.1,"Huge thanks to callmemickey for sharing this rare treat. 

Pours a cloudy golden yellow color with a two finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. Streaks and spots of lace left behind. 

Musty, funky aroma with a strong barnyard/horsey character giving off hints of wet hay, oak and straw. Theres also a nice lactic funk presence along with some sweet citrus acidity and faint malts. Little to no acetic character. Smells great. 

Tart, puckering mouthfeel with a good balance of lactic funk, citrus fruit, earthy oak and subtle acetic vinegar. Decently sour but pretty delicate and well balanced with the lemon acidity and musty oak complimenting the lactic funk. As the palate adjusts, the citrus and funky yeast flavors become more prominent. It could use a bit more funk/sourness but this beer is well balanced, flavorful and easy to put down.","philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA","corby112"

Wood, pepper, malt and funk. Dry woody, funky - but not too much, flavor. Slightly sour. Thin. Very good. I could drink this one all day.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"
358,"2011-10-17",3.6,"A steady, but careful pour into my large Tripel Karmeliet tulip produces a fluffy, four-finger thick, pale tan tinged, off-white colored head; the beer leaves lots of lacing on the sides of my glass.  The beer is a light amber color that shows an almost clear, pale amber tinged, gold hue when held up to the light.  When I first pull out the cork and am pouring this I get funky notes of urea, lactic acid and musk.  A more focused look at the aroma yields a big, funky mushroom note, that gets quite musty, amply sour in its lactic character, plus it has some more complex acidity to it (not just lactic, but it doesnt smell like it has any acetic, at least to me yet).  There is a substantial, muted (if that makes sense) fruitiness that smells mostly of tart grapefruit, but there are more subtle notes of pear and apple.  A really deep, lingering stay over the aroma yields notes of grassy grain, cracker like malt / wheat and some light phenolic notes.  The nose has quite a bit of musty, musky, phenolic funkiness to it that is quite nice, the acidity is a bit lighter than I would prefer, but it still has a nice sour smell to it.

The beer is quite light, definitely tart, with a prickly carbonation that washes over the palate.  The finish has a light, lactic acidity that lingers very lightly on the palate.  A funky mushroom character and woody oakiness picks up towards the beginning of each sip and lingers through to the finish before it is mostly wiped clean by an astringent, tannic character, carbonic acid and, surprisingly enough, nothing; the beer sort of disappears because it is so light in many ways.  There is a soft slickness to this beer when it is in the mouth (from the lactic acidity, and perhaps a touch from the oak), but mostly this is quite light, even for a Gueuze; it is not quite watery, but it is damn close.  The Brettanomyces funkiness isnt overly aggressive here, but does contribute a nice supporting character to this beer; the mushroom notes come from this, as does a hint of medicinal phenolics, perhaps a touch of mostly cured plastic.  As the beer warms up it picks up more grapefruit like notes towards the finish, and this gets especially amplified in my second pour that still has a zippy carbonation.

The body is perhaps the biggest flaw in this beer, most really good Gueuzes have a chewiness to them, part of it is more grain / malt character (in the flavor department to), but also part of it is more lactic slickness and more oak structure.  Still this is quite a good Gueuze, it would be perfectly balanced if it had more biting acidity and more grain character to go along with the funkiness and mustiness that is found here.  In the end, like the finish, this beer ends up disappearing and being too quickly forgotten.  A very nice beer, especially since I like Gueuze / Lambic so much, but this is actually quite a bit of a letdown b/c of the track record of the de Heeren van Liedekercke Lambics to date.  Still, I would be ecstatic to have a bunch of this beer on hand.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

M: Medium bodied with medium to high carbonation.

O: Had a bit of a Girardin Black Label mixed with Cuvee Rene feel to it.  I liked it, though I would like to see if that initial sulfur aroma dissipates over time.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

Several pours from the bottle at De Heerens 20th Anniversary celebration on Saturday September 3, a few hours after arriving in Belgium. Served in a HORAL mini gueuze tumbler.

Pours a nice clear golden color with a slight orange tint. Big, foamy white head and loads of lacing on the way down. Very bubbly.

Nose brings forward a really nice amount of funk and light cheese. Faint citrus and a nice earthy complexity. Horse blanket throughout. Some lemon and then a bit more funk. Very earthy. Quite cheesy as well.

The flavor is close to the nose, but not quite as complex. Probably closer to a 4.25. Plenty of funk and cheese plus a bit of citrus and a mild lactic acidity. Lemon is there as well as a bit of barnyard funk. Faint straw.

358,"2011-09-01",4.1,"75cl bottle at DHVL. This is made by Lindemans which is not a bad thing if they are creating an original style lambic which this one is. There is 2 year old Girardin in this blend but at this young stage im detecting much more Lindemans Cuvee Rene than Girardin Black Label. Although similar to the Cuvee Rene it has an extra depth and edge probably created by the addition of the Girardin lambic. The beer is too young to rate properly right now...Will pull one out of the cellar in a few months and re-rate.","São Paulo, BRAZIL","traPISSED"
