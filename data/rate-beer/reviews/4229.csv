Very tasty, but after the first three of their beers, this one had a tough time keeping up.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"
4229,"2011-12-17",3.4,"Bottle... Light brown, watery light tan head... The aroma is Cinnamon apple pie, lots of apple chunks, burnt brown sugar, a little vanilla and star anise too... Tastes more spicy, lots anise and cinnamon, loses most of the apples, could have balanced with more apples, finish with brandy and clove... Tastes like its supposed too but too much dessert like to drink more than a few ounces

4229,"2011-12-09",4.6,"Funky Buddha has done it again. Bonita Applebum is, simply put, dessert in a glass. All the familiar aromas and spices of apple pie - cinnamon, nutmeg, buttery crust, apple (obviously), along with just the right amount of alcohol. The slight apple tartness plays well with the spice and a low-key sweetness and its all reminiscent of caramel apple pie. Theyd be insane not to eventually offer this as a float with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, but the beer itself needs no improvement. The only downside to me is that apple-cinnamon is not my favorite flavor profile so its not as easy for me to drink more than one glass like I would with many of their other beers. The geniuses at Funky Buddha have received national attention for their Maple Bacon Coffee Porter and No Crusts PB&J ale, and Bonita should be the next huge hit.","Boca Raton, Florida, USA","brewkkake"
4229,"2011-12-03",2.7,"Nice rich dark brown color, but rather  sweet and over exaggerated and 
overbearing with the fruity taste, but masks the alcohol well at 6 %.","Coral Springs, Florida, USA","jjgmd"

4229,"2011-10-04",4.5,"This apple pie beer tastes and smells exactly like apple pie.  I think that is all that needs to be said, pretty impressive.","USA","Slimbrundage"
4229,"2011-10-03",4.2,"This beer and vanilla ice cream would be the perfect dessert. The beer is murky brown in color. This beer smells awesome with apples, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Its taste about the same as it smells with some added caramel. Its smells like a super sweet beer, but its really very drinkable. Now where is my ice cream!!!","Port St. Lucie, Florida, USA","biggsbowler"
4229,"2011-08-24",4.0,"On draft at Cigar City for Fruit in the Room 2011.  Pours a translucent brown with an off-white head.  Nose is sharp candied apples, cinnamon, nutmeg, and caramel.  Flavor is similar- a light brown ale backing a tremendous burst of candied apples, big cinnamon, caramel, and spice.  Light in body and a tremendously smooth apple and cinnamon finish.","North of Tampa, Florida, USA","markwise"
4229,"2011-08-21",4.5,"Ridiculous beer (in a good way!). Fruit in the Room 2011. Smelled amazing! Loads of cinnamon apple sauce, grainy malt, an indescribable sweetness, and some raisins. Reminded me of a well made apple cobbler. Spot on for sure. Poured a dark brown and light brown head. Tasted fantastic like apple pie a la mode. This one had loads of spice and some apple fruitiness that was incredibly pleasing to the palate. How do they do this??","Florida, USA","OmegaX"
4229,"2011-08-20",4.4,"Wow, had at Cigar City fruit in the room.  Aroma is cinnamon and apples.  Tastes like as if you went to applebees and get the apple crisp and the left over syrup with icecream was left.  You know how you scrape the iron skillet to get the last vanillia icecream, apple cinnamon syrup... well that is this beer pretty amazing...","Florida, USA","burg326"
4229,"2011-08-15",3.9,"Growler at Maltzillas tasting. Pours cloudy light caramel color with off white head. Smells like apple pie. Baked apple, cinnamon and graham carckers. Medium body with lively carbonation.","Winter Springs, Florida, USA","smith4498"
4229,"2011-08-12",4.0,"UPDATED: AUG 22, 2011 Draft... Murky brown ale with a mid-sized, creamy, khaki head. Decent retention. The bouquet is straight up apple pie, crust and all  cinnamon, brown sugar, apples and buttery graham. Full-bodied and silky with gentle carbonation. The flavor is a swirl of red apple, brown sugar and cinnamon flanked by moderate malic acid tartness and mild tannic bitterness. Finishes bittersweet and tangy with a kiss of graham crust. I miss my mom! :*(","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","hopscotch"
4229,"2011-08-12",4.3,"A near perfect beer. The base beer for this is Doc Brown. Beers actual name is Bonita Applebaum. Pours a very murky kinda ugly looking brown with a big creamy foamy head. The nose is ridiculous, fresh baked apples and cinnamon with a tough of biscuit and nutmeg. The flavor profile is where you get a bit of a problem but its very slight. Huge baked apples and cinnamon up front, big thick creamy mouthfeel, this tastes almost nothing like the base beer, its just super thick and creamy. The only thing I dont like is it finishes with a bit of odd tannic bitterness, but the apple finish keeps it from being annoying. Still the bitterness doesnt really fit with this beer, other than that its amazing.","Florida, USA","darkguardian"
4229,"2011-08-07",5.0,"Big thanks to Ryan for sharing this with us before its even released. When the guys at the Buddha make a ""apple pie"" beer you expect it to taste just like an apple pie and thats exactly what they did. This is by far one of the best creations theyve come  up with thus far. Incredible aroma and flavor, apple pie all the way. Wouldnt change a thing about this beer.",", Florida, USA","dimenhetfield"
