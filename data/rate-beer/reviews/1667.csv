Pours a dark brown color with a light tan head. Nose is pretty plain with some lightly-roasted malt, a bit of roast, and some toasted bread.

This is going to be their new regular stout according to the server, they need to do some tweaking before they do that...A dark brown pour with a light tan head that offers nice retention...The aroma is really nice, has a ton going on, light coffee, oats, sweet cream comes through to balance the coffee. Seems to be a light session stout...The taste is let down, I was expecting a lighter tasting stout, and it was light in taste and feel, but the problem is taste, just tastes bad. Light coffee comes through still but the balance of sweetness is gone, no cream at all, light coffee start to finish, its just boring! 

A session stout in the makings, balance out the taste more and this will be fine. Try it now and hopefully later when theyve improved.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","chibuck"

1667,"2007-03-07",3.6,"On tap at Flossmoor
This was the first of the heavier beers on the sampler tray.  I was starting to tire but with a few hours to kill I was determined to finish them off.  After all, how hard can it be to work through a half-dozen 4 ounce samples?  This was not a bad stout - despite it being an average stout, that places it pretty high in my opinion.  I would order this again as an alternative to some of the special releases.
Aroma / Appearance - The deep black body soaked up most of the light directed towards it.  A maple brown head decorated the top provided some nice eye candy.  The nose was a mixture of iced coffee, fresh asphalt, roasted oats and musty books.  The closest scent is that of a wet dog coming in from a downpour.
Flavor / Palate - Sweet oatmeal, brown sugar and milk form a breakfasty introduction.  Next comes lunch (wheatgrass, malts) and then dessert in the form of chocolate chip cookies.  In some ways it reminds me of a milk stout with a sweet hoppy finish.  This is a very well made stout.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

1667,"2003-06-11",3.9,"UPDATED: OCT 30, 2006 Draft. Its been hard to catch this Iron Horse at the station. Theres only so much brewing capacity, and this take awhile to make, so this is usually the tap that suffers (but we usually have the Eclipse or Dark Star as compensation). I was there yesterday while the US Open was going on nearby, and it was flowing pretty freely.
Brown head kicks up a few larger bubble than an average stout, and fizzes away quickly, I had no lace. It has that watery but substantial mouthfeel you usually get with a good hand-pulled English beer. Taste reveals complex coffee and coca notes, a subtle suggestion of whisky, and a warm oatmeal feel. It gives one that feeling only those who have become acclimated to a slightly oily stout can enjoy. Its bitter, but not hoppy-bitter. Im left with an impish grin or am I just puckered up?Additional note, 10/30/06: Iron Horse is back after nearly 18 months. Matt was trying out just about every other style of stout known to man in the meantime, though. He says this recipe is not changed from the original. But this particualr batch didnt ferment all the way through and stuck at 5% abv. But I do not find a noticable sweetness here, just lots of roasty coffee and chocolate malts. Oatmeal barely makes a dent in its flavor. I also catch a bit of tart cherry, like soured Guinness, toward the end.","Downers Grove, Illinois, USA","DrnkMcDermott"
