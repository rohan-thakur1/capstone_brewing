1197,"2017-03-11",3.8,"Can (03-01-17). Hazy pale yellow with a large frothy head. Fruity, citrusy, gently tropical, fairly complex hop plethora in the nose. Bitter, but unintrusive. Modern, lean bodied for the style, without the NE ultra proteinated body nor the crystal of older examples. A fine, aromatic Double IPA that manages to remain refreshing enough with the relative subtlety of its 8.5% alcohol.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"
1197,"2016-12-02",4.2,"Poured from 32 oz crowler. Pours deep straw to light copper with thin white head. Huge aroma of tropical fruit i cannot even identify. Probably the most interesting aroma of an ipa i have had. Bitter but not overly the lighter malt body makes it shine and is very rounded. Lingering fruit and hops. Just a well done 2ipa.

1197,"2016-07-18",4.2,"Tasted on 7/17/16 from a 32oz can purchased at the brewery. Pours nearly clear pale orange with a thick off-white head that slowly recedes to thick, super sticky lace. The nose is a really cool mixture of citrus peel, tropical fruit, dank grassy resin, and just a hint of bread malt. The flavor is a bit more citrus peel, still tons of tropical mango, with the grassy resin providing some bitterness, and just enough malt to balance. The body is medium with a somewhat oily, round texture, average carbonation, and a long lightly bitter citrus peel and mango finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"

>> Big surprise today from AZW. Chewy and denser copper style DIPA - usually a surefire recipe to a 3.3 rating from me max. However, this one is able to pull it off with a chewy but not sticky malt backbone, some balancing toffee to a big hop smackdown. Juicy mouthfeel, fresh.

Its more faint than Id like too. Tastes oily and dank. Mild bitterness. So many different flavors pop up at different times. Caramel, pine, grapefruit, biscuits, apricots, flowers, onion, grass, mango, and a touch of booze. Super smooth for such a hoppy IPA. Mixed feelings on this one. I wish the aroma was better and I think I just expected more based on the ratings. Good Imperial IPA but not great.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
1197,"2015-05-13",4.1,"Draft. Brilliant clarity and a surprisingly light hue. This could fool you into thinking its a milder ale. One finger of wispy white head pops away quickly. Huge, fresh, bright hop aroma. Fresh-cut grass, grapefruit peel, alcohol, candied lemon. Brilliant. So many C-hops. Theres no way this is 8.5 percent -- it tastes as clean and crisp and light as a session IPA. Candied lemon qappears again, with grass and lingering apricot. Soft, medium light, whipped-cream body. Mildly carbonated. Fantastic hop flavor and aroma in this one, and it has a much lighter in body than the ABV suggests. Too drinkable for its own good.","","PartyFowle"

1197,"2014-03-24",4.6,"Location: Draft at the Brewpub, 3/7/14, Rating #3500!


Aroma: The aroma is a wonderful mix of grapefruit, mango, citrus, pine, and resiny hops

Appearance: Pours a mostly clear golden-orange color with a small off-white head and nice lace

Flavor: The taste is much the same, big and hoppy, juicy, and just the right amount of sweetness

Palate: The body is medium-full, it has a soft feel, a clean drinkability, and a nice, dry finish

Overall Impression: 
Totally lives up to the hype. This is an excellent beer. Absolutely loved it. Somehow this is super hoppy and yet balanced enough if your a little hops afraid. This is right up there with my personal favorite beers I have ever tried. I didnt want to leave a sip over, it was that good. If this was anywhere near me I would drink it all the time.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"

1197,"2013-12-26",4.4,"So a 64oz growler of this was killed in no time Thanksgiving Day between my brother-in-law and myself. It was just too damn good. He loved it and prefers it over the Refuge IPA. The growler poured with a clear copper body that has golden hues and supports a light tan head. The aroma offers up a pleasing and inviting mix of citrusy hops and mango as well as resiny pine notes and a faint ring of hoppy dank onions well underneath the sticky fruity aromas. The taste is pretty full on the tongue allowing for a suspended and relaxing quaff of this tasty liquid. Like the aroma I get a tasty array of clementine and tangelo and grapefruit malt sweetened hoppy goodness that has some richness and depth. Along the periphery of the flavor lingers modest resiny pine hops and a grounding earthy onion dank hoppiness. These notes are just going very well together. I hope they make this one again.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"

1197,"2013-11-28",4.3,"On tap at the brewpub. Pours a glorious bright, medium orange with a perfect, one-finger, completely smooth head. Holy grapefruit, Batman! The aroma is a delightful grapefruit explosion early, followed by dank pine and sweet orange. Dear Lord, what a swirl of delicious, hoppy goodness. Mango, pine resin, orange, damp hay, fresh-cut lumber, and wildflowers blooming in the desert dance on the taste buds all at once. While its definitely hop-heavy, the bitterness never overwhelms the palate. Lovely lingering bitter finish that doesnt leave me feeling like I just chewed on hop pellets.
