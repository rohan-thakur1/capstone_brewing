4255,"2017-06-20",3.0,"A tad on the sweet side, with lactose overshadowing any depth the malts themselves might have provided. Tastes like Key Lime Pie, sure, but too much like a bottle of Stewarts Soda for comfort. Tart lime goes nicely with the moderate lacto sourness, and the graham and vanilla notes come through on the finish, but I can do without this much sugar in my beer. Refreshing, drinkable, but a one-timer.","Tennessee, USA","oobawa"

4255,"2017-06-17",3.4,"Can. Vanilla, lime, graham, malt and straw aroma. Golden yellow with small head. Lightly sweet-tart lime, vanilla, graham, light malt, and mildly bitter straw flavor. Body on the light side. Succeeds in smelling and tasting like key lime pie.","Greenville, Indiana, USA","shrubber85"

4255,"2017-06-13",3.7,"Ok, yes, this is a gimmicky beer. But geez, this was tasty. Lots of lime right off the bat, and there is graham cracker, as advertised. I even got a touch of vanilla. I honestly could drink a lot of this...","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"

4255,"2017-06-03",3.1,"Can served in a glass, 
this ale was a light gold-orange in the glass and gave a white cover of bubbles that was less than a fingers worth, wispy and withdrew rather quickly, there were a few spots of lacing that did not last, 

the nose had aromas of lime, sugar, lactose, very light malt, a touch of citrus hops, 
some lime fruit with other citrus fruit that was pretty much in the background, 

the flavors were lime, lime skin and citrus, light malt and bread, light sweetness, 
the finish had a small citrus bite with a bit of hops that gave some dryness and touch of crispness on the tongue, 
lime citrus and light malt afterwards, 

the mouth feel was light and there was average to lively carbonation on the tongue, 

a light malt beer with lime and sugar like sweetness, 
I enjoyed the nose more than the flavor, 
the sweetness was more present on the nose than the flavor but the sweetness sort goes away a bit after the beer has sat around for a couple of minutes, this may be a good beer to introduce someone to craft beer, 
this beer would be a nice drink for a hot Summer day.","Michigan, USA","BigBeer45"
4255,"2017-06-02",3.6,"Actually smells like key lime. Creamy and tart start with a smooth, slightly crisp finish. Enjoyable summer beer.

4255,"2017-05-26",3.5,"Can.
Clear yellow with a fleeting head like a soda would have.
Aroma of Key Lime Pie and whipped cream. No hops, malt or any other beer things here.
he flavor starts with some lime followed by a strange transition with a key lime -graham cracker finish.
This might grow on me. Certainly better than any Brrrr Ita.","Tennessee, USA","SpringsLicker"

A- Key lime pie, cool whip.

A- Gold color, clear liquid, white head.

T- Key lime pie, cool whip, graham crackers, lime, slightly tart, sweet.

P- Light body, average texture, average carbonation, refreshing finish.

O- Sure as heck smells and tastes just like key lime pie. Lime pie, whipped topping, graham cracker crust and all. Sure as heck also wouldve never guessed its 7.5% abv. Drinks like 3%. A tad bit novelty like in my opinion and too sweet to drink more than a can but really good. I bet it would actually taste good in cooking a dessert. Easily one of the best things Tallgrass has done recently. If this was from Funky Buddha or something Im sure the ratings would be a lot higher overall.","Ravenna, Nebraska, USA","HuskerTan"
4255,"2017-05-20",3.8,"12 oz can. Pours a slightly cloudy golden yellow. Smells of key lime pie. Taste is key lime pie. Amazing that they could get this to taste just like key lime pie.","Macomb, Illinois, USA","basaywhat"
4255,"2017-05-19",3.9,"Can:
Lightly hazed yellow gold with a sudsy off-white head.
Aroma is spot on key lime pie, right down to the crust.
Flavour is nicely sweet/tart lime, Graham cracker, grain malt.....even a creamy feel to the body.
Hands down the most accurate recreation of key lime pie Ive had to date.....really good.","Coxs Knob, columbus, Indiana, USA","Patrickctenchi"
4255,"2017-05-18",3.5,"Can from Craft Brewed. Pours a clear gold with a quick dissipating head. Nose is all key lime pie, with some rock candy and graham cracker as it warms. Light body, crisp and tart. Creamy cheese cake quality. Lingering tart finish with some lacto. A fun summer beer, but a little too sweet on the palate.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","willisread"

4255,"2017-05-13",4.0,"12 ounce can into pint glass, best before 9/14/2017. Pours fairly clear medium golden/yellow color with a 1-2 finger foamy white head with solid retention, that reduces to a minimal spotty lace cap that lingers. Minimal lacing on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Good appearance. Aromas of tart lemon, lime peel, green apple, graham cracker, vanilla, marshmallow, and light herbal/yeast earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance of lime peel, lactose, acidic yeast, and light-moderate pale malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big tart lemon, lime peel, green apple, graham cracker, vanilla, marshmallow, and light herbal/yeast earthiness. Light-moderate fruity/lactic tartness and slight bitterness on the finish. Lingering notes of tart lemon, lime peel, green apple, graham cracker, vanilla, marshmallow, and light herbal/yeast earthiness on the finish for a good bit. Great robustness and balance of lime peel, lactose, acidic yeast, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/tartness balance, and zero puckering flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from tartness/acidity, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and light body; with a very smooth, crisp, moderately acidic, and fairly creamy/grainy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 4.2%. Overall this is a great fruited sour blonde ale. All around great robustness and balance of lime peel, lactose, acidic yeast, and light-moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and refreshing to drink with the balanced tart/acidic finish. Not much complexity going on, but this nails exactly what it is going for in the name. Nice Lacto presence, but it never overwhelms the lime peel/lactose flavors. A really enjoyable offering.","Michigan, USA","superspak"

4255,"2016-08-03",2.5,"Draft at the Tallgrass Taphouse. Lightly hazy orange golden color. What an atrocious beer. Its not sour of me funky. Its straight up artificial, heavy on cream flavors, key lime. Nose is very strong. Flavor has a bit more sprite flavor and a sprite like lime tartness. But its definitely and aberration.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
4255,"2016-07-28",3.3,"4 ounce draught sample at Red Eye Brewing Company, Wausau WI. Pours a honey-amber color, faintly cloudy, with just a wisp of foam that fades...absolutely entrancing aroma - particularly if you actually love key lime pie as I do - of that wonderful dessert, with the graham-cracker notes and all, sweet limes, a hint of vanilla, with just a bit of sour-tart pungent hoppiness showing up after a few nosings....quite tart and on the tongue, fairly dry - this is not after all primarily a ""fruit beer"" by intention - with the lime-juice fruitiness coming through only faintly at first, more as it warms, also a touch of lemon and some light (quite light) pale biscuity malt. After a few minutes it alas takes on more of a soda-like character (though never so sweet) and the finish is thin and pretty strongly carbonated. Promising, and this is another argument against sample sizes as I think I might have really gotten a better feel for this with a full snifter or pint. Still fairly interesting and if I find this on draught again Ill likely give it another shot.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
