Aroma is surprisingly interesting considering the traveling this beer made as there¬ís really some oranges features along mild spiciness, piney notes and nutty notes. Taste is also oranges forward but less than aroma, there¬ís a good spicy malt backbone along resinous notes, caramel-ish presence and moderate to medium bitterness. Medium body. Medium carbonation. A bit oily mouthfeel. Dry and resinous presence. At the source, it¬ís probably really good as it¬ís still above average after a trip through the Atlantic.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

3365,"2016-02-16",4.1,"5%ABV. Session IPA.

Poured out a rich Amber. 14¬∫SRM.

Nose is full of pine freshness and sweetness. There is a citrus brightness to it to be complete, but really it¬ís the pine that shines through. The citrus on this one is sweet and like a ripe orange.

Mouthfeel is sudsy. There is aggressive carbonation. Palate has nice roast malt flavors of toasted malt, caramel and water chestnut sweetness. Hops are aggressive and characterized by spicy freshness like a poblano without the heat. There is a vegetal freshness like Thai basil, bitter herbs and hyssop. 

The finish is long and hyssop bitter.

Goes on Favorites List!

This beer needs a pouring instruction - should I pour it carefully or not? Decided not to. Let¬ís see. It¬ís an opaque murky orange, loads of pieces floating around; head is big and bubbly, retention and lacing quite good. There is an incredible rush of orange and tangerine when opening the bottle, even more so when sniffing from the glass, it¬ís almost terrifyingly intense, piney and resiny, sugar-coated dried pineapples and mango, Mosaic and Simcoe also very much present in the mix... juicy, succulent, bitter... Taste is moderately sweet with biscuits and indistinct tropical fruits apparent, incredibly juicy, then the palate-crushing citric bitterness takes over, finishing in an equally bitter sensation, sticky and resinous, almost a bit too harsh, and dry on the palate... But there¬ís always a refreshing juiciness felt on the roof of the mouth. Carbonation way below average, body mediumish.

On the palate, lightly sweet with lots of orange pulp and a bit of peel to start, moderate caramel core, grassy and floral. Becomes quite dry and astringent from the middle on, orange peel, spicy, fresh conifer, really quite bitter and resiny but no concentrated hop oil flavours. Medium bodied with average carb. Kind of an odd session IPA, on the higher ABV side with more malt and a bigger bittering hop component. Orange rind contributes nicely to the nose and early palate, but the quite dry and bitter, not particularly flavourful finish undoes that.
