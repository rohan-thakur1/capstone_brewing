After starting with a disappointing pour of Black Note I moved on to a couple of new beers. This one was decent for the style and much easier to finish than the previous beer. As this has been on almost every year I would expect it to reappear again at next years Maduro event.

Aroma / Appearance - The hazy body was the color of an espresso milkshake topped by shavings from a plank of maple. Long spindly legs creep down the sides. The smell of musty redwood floors coupled with a sweet texture. Topped by maple and cherry fruit filling from a vending machine it harmonizes well.

Flavor / Palate - Maple, Twix, and nutty touches flow across the palate. The chewy mouthfeel leaves a dry warm finish. Heady after a half pint I decided to move on to the next beer only to save the palate. The Friday before the Great Taste is about pacing yourself not racing to the finish line by 3 PM.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Nutty and slightly bready up front with a hint of toast and a light fruity element. A touch of earth towards the end before this finishes nutty and smooth with a light fruit and hint of toast that dries with a bit of chocolate creeping in there. Medium length aftertaste following a smooth, medium body and a moderate carbonation. Overall, a pretty nice beer. Pleasant, richer nutty and toffee flavor with a touch of earth and toast along with a decent fruity yeast element. Nothing crazy, but enjoyable.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Pours a mostly-clear brown-amber color with a short white head. Some spotty lacing as it goes down. The nose is pretty tame, bringing just a bit of malt and bread crust. The flavor is more complex and fits the style quite well, bringing some nice earthy elements and a slight fruity touch. Bread is the main characteristic. Some sweetness.

It definitely had a nutty earthy thing going on and with a little but not too much malty sweetness, it was pretty tasty. It didnt look like much in my sample glass, but I was impressed nonetheless.
