853,"2014-09-27",3.3,"""supes up a traditional pilsner more true to style than some imperials ive had - which is both good and bad. this was a good beer for sure. but nothing ill be jonesing to have again right away. cereal malt and grassy hops on the nose. flavor is both sweet and grassy, with a bit of spice as well. medium bodied, pretty smooth. Surprisingly a little blander on tap.""","Reno, Nevada, USA","slowrunner77"
853,"2013-08-11",3.4,"Bottle: &nbsp Orangish straw, bright, moderate frothy white head, spotty lacing. &nbsp Strong sweet grassy nose. &nbsp Very similar on the tongue. &nbsp A touch mealy, but has enough bitterness to balance it out. &nbsp Body and 

mouthfeel are smooth yet moderate. &nbsp Clean finish, grassy, a bit thick. &nbsp Hard to tell this is 7.5% for a Strong Pils. &nbsp Nothing to write home about, but clean, and very easy to drink. &nbsp Very respectable.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
853,"2012-12-26",3.3,"Bottle from South Bay Drugs: Created a thick layer of frothy foamed head while the liquid was a golden straw color. Aroma was somewhat mild with a heavy presence of malts and grassy hops that actually did smell like an imperial pils. The flavor was grassy as well with a background of honey oat wheat bread and a healthy serving of hops considering this was an American made pils. There is also a background of funky yeast that was interesting to try upon the first bottle, but after drinking another bottle it played itself out. For sure I wont be repeating this beer, but at least I gave it a second chance.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"
853,"2012-07-23",2.0,"Imperial pils, it is an oxymoron. This one is sweet, like a pils version of a malt liquor.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

853,"2012-06-05",4.1,"Bottle: pours blond with a medium sized white head and a slight haze. Aroma is bready with some dry grass, light honey, and a little citrus.  Flavor is bready malt with hay and other soft tart/bitter grass notes, a little doughy yeast, and a touch of honey. Palate has a mouthfull of sweet malt mingling with some nice grassy bitters.  Nice flavors, a bit heavy, but well balanced.","El Cerrito, California, USA","rayOfBeer"
853,"2012-05-17",3.2,"Aromas of yeast, dough and subtle lemon. Appearance is a deep gold with a decent foam top. Flavors of sweet yeast and oats with some caramel malts. Lightly carbonated with a light texture on the palate. Overall, this is a decent beer with fairly simple flavoring and a nice alcohol warming feeling. Id give this a C+ rating.","Los Angeles, CA, California, USA","Thisis12ptfont"
853,"2012-04-14",3.6,"Nice, but confusing. Light amber with hops on the nose. Medium bodied and it drinks like a sweet malty English ale or a bock. Great finish. Id never guess a Pilsner if served blind.","Washington, USA","Aml42000"
853,"2012-03-28",3.6,"Shared with Strykzone via Facebook Chat.  This poured a hazy light orange with a long lasting foamy white head and a lot of lacing. Attractive. The nose is light malt with a hoppy citrus aroma. Medium in body and smooth in mouthfeel. Flavor is tasty, with some cirrus and flowers. Some light bitterness in the finish. A very drinking brew, and you do not know it is an imperial as the alcohol is well hidden.","Eureka, California, USA","hayduke"
853,"2012-03-26",3.4,"Bomber from Hayduke.  We shared it via facebook chat.  This poured with a bit of copper but was mostly gold.  It was also well carbonated.  A but of fruit in the nose and some interesting hop note.  The flavor was also gentle fruit with some sweetness and very light bitterness.  Something 
Ike necter, too.  This was an improvement over other impy pilsners.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
853,"2012-01-28",3.7,"fresh bottle from Texas Liquor (in Carsblad, Cal.) Very easy to drink hoppy beer.  An understated bitterness that was most pleasant during a long luncheon.  Mild hoppy aromas.  Some citrus, medium mouthfeel, and one-quarter inch of retained head on cloudy lightly orange body.  Satisfying, not heavy, sure not a double IPA and cannot be held up to that sort of hop assault.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","Sammy"
853,"2012-01-20",2.9,"Interesting, yet pretty basic taste. Almost more of a wheat beer or light belgian then a pils. Pours golden, and has a malty taste.

853,"2011-10-30",2.1,"22oz bottle pours a transparent gold with some spitty white head.  This does not smell good.  Smells like rotting corn, like a corn cob that fell onto the ground and got wet.  Very sugary aroma too.  Flavor has honey, corn sugar mixed with water, malty, overly chewed bubblegum.  Full bodied, bland, sugary, white bread finish.","SouthWest, Washington, Washington DC, USA","nimbleprop"
853,"2011-09-20",3.7,"Bottle from bhensonb. Pours cloudy golden with a thick off-white head and a floral aroma. There is a hearty roasted malt flavor with some toffee and a dry bitter finish. Very tasty.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"

853,"2011-08-04",2.9,"Thanks to a generous individual for getting this bottle out to me. Served in a tulip.

Pours a clear light apricot color with a thin white head that quickly falls down into a few bubbles. Thin collar throughout. The nose is lightly grainy without too much depth. Some bready malt and not much in the way of hops. The flavor is bready with some light grain in the background. Hop bitterness comes through on the backend, though isnt really present in the flavor. Medium body with high carbonation and a bit of an alcohol bite in the finish. Decent enough, though not my favorite.

853,"2011-08-01",2.8,"[Bottle] Clear copper hue, decent head formation. Sugarry caramel aroma, light cooked corn. Sweet caramel, hard boiled sugar candy intro before a fair bitter hoppiness in the finish (that IPA bitterness rather than pilsener). Even with the bitterness theres still a big, almost sherry like sweetness towards the end. Looks like many have rated this well but I found it to be a strange mixture.","California, USA","BeerLimey"
853,"2011-06-06",3.4,"On tap at SDBrewing co. Warm honey amber looking pour with petri dish head and lace. Nose is sweet hay and flat malt/yeast. Rather pale aleish. Taste is big alcohol and sweet grass hay. Rather strong in its lightness. Hops and malt in back. Lotsa sweet candy thickness. Just ok.","San Diego, California, USA","Lagunitasfan"

853,"2010-12-24",3.4,"Bomber from BevMo. Clear dark golden in color. Somewhat grassy nose with a little bit of sweetness. Sweat and grassy flavors. Decent hoppiness. Pretty interesting. Pretty much tastes like I would think an impy pilsner would taste. Everything is pretty much taken and ramped up.","La Mesa, California, USA","mjg74"
853,"2010-12-02",3.5,"Crystal clear golden color with a thin white head.  Cereal and corn on the aroma with a hint of sweetness.  Sticky on the tongue with a clean and fairly bitter taste.  Karo syrup and corn on the follow through.  Finishes smooth and silky, leaving a lasting impression on the palate.  I think this could have benefited by being a bit more ""Imperial"" (i.e. more alcohol) to cut through some of the sweetness.","Tustin, California, USA","J_man"
853,"2010-10-31",3.6,"Tasted from a bomber bottle purchased at Beverages 4 Less.  Pours clear light orange with an average white head that leaves a solid collar of lace after a slow recession.  The nose is interesting, starting with a pretty straight-forward hops and pilsner malt, but there is also an underlying sort of plastic aroma that I also get off of some single malt scotches.  The flavor has some sweetness, but is dominated by the kind of hay-like pilsner flavor and some hoppiness to round everything out.  The body is medium with average carbonation and a medium hops and malt finish.","Nashville, Tennessee, USA","wedgie9"
853,"2010-10-26",3.7,"well.... sorry distracted by crazy stories.... Poured with a nice head that pretty much lasts the whole bottle (bomber) and lots of lace. Color is a clear golden amber with some bubble trails. Aroma is malt, hop, dry  leather, a little pine.  Flavor is like aroma with great carbonation. Finish is like flavor and has medium length.","La Crosse, Wisconsin, USA","drpimento"

853,"2010-09-05",3.7,"Nearly golden slightly orange color w/ a small white head and some light soapy lacing.  Avg Pal.  The flavor is lightly doughy w/ a nice slightly bitter clean citrus & floral hop finish.  Some nice sweetness both caramels and fruits the bread like tone is subtle but nice.  The aroma is similar definite dry hoppy hints of some light floral pieces, with a light touch of sweet breads.  Very easy to drink, and easily the best ""pilsner"" Ive tasted.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"
853,"2010-09-01",3.2,"Another mediocre offering. Pours clear amber with a medium sized white head that leaves good lace. Smells of sweet, sugary malts with a good dose of resiny, astringent hops. Tastes about the same. Sweet and malty with a dash of hops and a lingering sweet, cereal malt flavor. Medium body, subdued carbonation.","San Diego, California, USA","doubleo"
853,"2010-09-01",2.9,"Bomber from a friend at Karl Strauss. Color is a golden amber with minimal white head. Aroma is grassy hops with a little bit of citrus. Taste fades pretty quickly. Finishes dry.","San Diego, California, USA","bhightow"
853,"2010-08-30",3.1,"Bomber.  Pours peach-amber, with a surprisingly small head.  Aroma has cut grass, mild citrus, and malt.  Mouthfeel is soft and a touch on the fuller side.  Flavor starts with grassy hop punch, mellows with caramel sweetness, then finishes quickly.  A bit indescript for my tastes, though Im finding this new-wave style of Imperial Pilsner to be disappointing in general.","Honolulu, Hawaii, USA","elihapa"
853,"2010-08-22",2.6,"On tap at the Beachwood BBQ - Seal Beach, CA. Soapy pilsner malt aroma, thick with sugars and yeast. Pours a coppery dark golden, clearish with minimal whitish head. Flavors of not-crisp pilsner malt sugars, lots of malt creaminess and some distant hops. Ragingly and punishingly sweet. Just too much. I want bright fresh crispness out of this, with nice bright hoppiness, but it just isnt there. Soapy in the finish.","Ithaca, New York, USA","auerbrau"
853,"2010-08-22",3.6,"Sampled on 8/20/2010. This Imperial Pilsner pours a medium orange gold color from a 22oz bottle. Small to medium sized white foamy head with nice lacing. The aroma is fruity and sweet, graint and grassy. A medium to full bodied imperial pilsner. The malts are fruity and sweet, a touch cereal and grainy. The hops are herbal and earthy, with a touch of spiciness. Nice balance. Decent carbonation. A touch sweet perhaps, and would like it to be a little spicier. Nice smooth mouthfeel. Mouthfeel is full. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"
853,"2010-08-10",3.5,"Bomber from Holiday Wine. Pours amberish gold with a 3 finger foamy, clingy ringy white head. Aroma is rather perfumey over light malt. Medium plus body with foamy carbonation. Flavor is pale malt, but a little roasty, and a lot of grassy/spicey hop. However, the whole flavor thing is almost a unity - this is really tastey, and the aroma continues perfumey/floral. Then as it all washes away it goes grassy flavor. Dry. Leaving bitter in the mouth. Never had anything that this reminds me of. Good stuff.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
853,"2010-08-05",3.6,"The easiest to drink bomber Ive ever consumed. Pour is honey amber in color, decent white head, zero lacing. Aroma of bread and maybe faint cloth band aids with apricot. Light on the tongue, but more rich with nuts, honey, melon, and pronounced resinous hops. Very slight dryness to the finish, but fades quickly. Really nice on a hot summer evening.","Austin, Texas, USA","ManvsCity"
853,"2010-08-01",3.2,"Tap at La Jolla.  Clear yellow pour.  Malty aroma, light fruit, honey, wheat bread.  Flavor is crisp and clean with an earthy hops to go with the nice caramelly malts.  Not bad at all.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","daknole"
853,"2010-07-25",3.1,"A: The pour is a light orange color with a fluffy white head on it.

S: This is very sweet on the nose with a sugar character and a bit of bread. The hops are appropriate for a pilsner, floral and a bit of spice.

T: The flavor is incredibly short lived, absolutely unlike any other beer that Ive come across. Sweet and bready with a hint of coconut and then...nothing.

M: Medium bodied with a smooth, medium carbonation.

D: Not a bad tasting beer, but the shortness of the flavor baffled me. Im not sure what caused that, but it at least made this beer more interesting.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
853,"2010-07-20",3.5,"Bottle. Pours with a clear golden body and a large white head. Aromas of bitter, spicy, herbal noble hops. Very pungent hoppiness. Light sweetness, and breadiness. Some fruit coming from the hops as well (I guess, it isnt the lager yeast). Taste is bready, nutty, herbal, grassy, spicy, sticky noble hops. Very abrupt and clean finish. Finishes [thankfully] nice and dry, with a lingering delicate malt profile. Well crafted, but I dont absolutely love it. Not bad though. Lively bubbles.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
853,"2010-07-19",3.3,"Draft. Amber beer with a cream colored head. Malt and mineral aroma. Malt and light caramel flavor with mineral and light grass. Medium bodied. Malt and light caramel lingers with light grain, light mineral, and light grass.","Alamo, California, USA","bb"
853,"2010-07-18",3.7,"Clear golden with a tiny off white head. Aroma had quite a few grassy hops, pale malt and hints of caramel. Flavour had loads of grassy hops, pale malts, caramel and a solid bitternes towards the end. Dry and clean. Lovely take on the style.","Frederiksberg C, DENMARK","KimJohansen"
853,"2010-07-13",4.1,"Bomber. Im normally not a Pils guy, but I like to try new stuff. Ive tried a few different Imperial Pilsner styles, and this one is very good! The stuff coming out of Karl Strauss lately has been very good. The nose is light, the color is dark yellow to orange, and the taste is great. Huge flavors of herbal goodness with some earthy and yet hoppy bite. I like it and will buy it again.","Oceanside, California, USA","ChazMania"
853,"2010-07-12",4.0,"Appearance: Pours a clear amber tinted yellow gold. The head is large, beige and fluffy.

Aroma: Crisp mixture of biscuity malt and euro hops. Nothing like a cheap beer, but more like a fresh, hoppy pilsner.


Taste: Biscuits with honey, big spicy hops. Alcohol is well hidden.


Mouthfeel: Full bodied, slightly creamy and moderately carbonated.


Overall:  Fresh, this beer is beautifully balanced, slightly sweet, and the driest hoppiest imperial pils Ive had to date. What a great beer.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"
853,"2010-07-05",3.9,"22oz bottle from BevMo.  Pours a crystal clear deep gold with a nice frothy 2 finger thick white head, some sheeted lacing was left on the glass.

Nice.","San Diego (Mira Mesa), California, USA","papajohn"
853,"2010-06-23",4.3,"Had this on tap at Small Bar on Fathers Day. Poured a deep golden color into a nonic pint glass. Upfront there are some grassy saaz hops, lots of toasted malt, and decent amount of the crisp slightly sulfury lager yeast character. Not as dry as I would have hoped for but definitely crisp and refreshing. Worth a shot, especially as the weather heats up.","California, USA","hoptrip619"
853,"2010-06-19",4.4,"Tried the Whistler Imperial Pils on tap at Small Bar during rollout pint night Thursday night. This just looked good. Poured a dark golden color with a 1 frothy head that dissipated rather quickly. I smelled toasted malts, definitely a grassy hop presence. Was it dry-hopped? I tased crisp and clean toasted malts with a lot of grassy hop flavor and a pretty decent bitterness that lingered through the dry finish. Nothing heavy-handed. Medium bodied and very easy drinking. This was the best stab at a Czech-style pilsner that Ive tried. Strong recommendation.","California, USA","jjh19"
853,"2010-06-18",3.6,"UPDATED: JUN 19, 2010 650 ml bottle from Bev4less. Pours a translucent copper color with a big white fluffy head that has good retention and some lacing. The aroma is mild and indistinct with grains, yeast and some saaz hops. The flavor features biscuit, dough, yeast, nutty hops and mildly funky  hops. The palate is a bit light but builds to a malty conclusion. The finish is short and dry. Overall: I find this pils a very refreshing choice. Much more like a good English biter than a pils--whatever the hell this it was the right beer at the right time.","Ouray, Colorado, USA","StefanSD"
