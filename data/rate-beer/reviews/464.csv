Kolor nieprzejrzyście czarny. Piana potężna, jasno beżowa, drobnopęcherzykowa. Długo pływa po powierzchni i pięknie krążkuje.
Nad piwiem unosi się gruby, conajmniej 2-centymetrowy wianuszek.
W aromacie dosłownie eksplozja ziaren kawy. Tak mocny aromat kawy czułem kiedyś w piwie Browar Leśniczówka Coffee Smoked Tobacco Ale Aged On Tabacco ;-)))
Głęboko pod nimi ukryte są akcenty gorzkiej czekolady i oczywiście mocna paloność.
W smaku obawiałem się wysokiej kwaskowatości pochodzącej od mocnej kawy. Tymczasem otrzymałem intensywną kawę, ale zbalansowaną akcentami mlecznej czekolady.
Wraz z nimi dodać do całości należy: karmel, wanilię i prażone orzechy.
Goryczka średnia stanowiąca połaczenie sugestii kawowych z czekoladowymi.
Subtelne drapanie na języku od palonych ziaren kawy.
Wysoka pijalność i fenomenalnie gęsta faktura.

The beer is a rich, oily, black brown topped with a brown, dense soap head that has moderate-light retention, and a touch of lace. The beer?s texture is syrupy with foamy carbonation. The medium body carries a taste of moderate bittersweetness with a chocolate espresso flavor profile and a light toffee and nuts undertone. The finish is surprisingly clean and fresh with a chalkiness consistency and lactose flavor this turns to an aftertaste of dark chocolate that?s very light and mellow.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

>>> A flavorful, well balanced and easy drinking coffee Stout. Bells are good with dark beers. 

-  Dark brown with a medium easy to revive creamy brown head, good retention and little lacing. 
-  Its bursting with espresso beans flavors in both aroma and taste. 
-  Sweetness is moderate and the beer is rather well balanced. Strong espresso is working harmoniously with a rich dark chocolate presence and roasted malts. 
-  Fully bodied stout with medium carbontion and a rich oily mouthfeel. 
-  Despite 7,5% abv, the beer isnt boozy at all and despite being quite flavorful its also fairly drinkable. 
-  Theres a mild coffee acidity in taste. 

Flavors:  Espresso beans, dark chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, mild herbal notes, mild acidity (taste).","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

464,"2014-05-21",4.0,"Transfer from BA review on 2-29-12 - 
Served on tap in a 10 oz chalice glass

Appearance  Served a deep brown nearly black color with a billowy tan head. The head was rather persistent and lasted some time before fading and leaving some nice lacing.

Smell  Coffee aromas are strong. They are dark and roasty in nature. There is also an ever so light sweet chocolate aroma toward the middle and end of the aroma, but very light in comparison to the strong coffee.

Taste  Just as the nose forebode, the taste is quite heavy in coffee. The dark roasted flavor permeates the mouth in the initial taste mixed with a strong roasted malt backbone. Some bitter chocolate works its way in toward the middle of the taste. While the taste is roasty coffee and a bit of bitter chocolate in the beginning it is still very smooth on the tongue. Toward the end the taste sweetens ever sol slightly, giving a lightly sweet coffee and cocoa flavor. It is quite pleasant and a not the slightest bit harsh.

Mouthfeel  The body is rather creamy and the carbonation rather low. It coats the tongue allowing all the coffee and chocolate flavors to permeate the tongue; giving big flavors. Its very pleasant and relaxing.

Overall  This is one nice affordable coffee stout. One to try over and over again and have on many of occasions.","","Darkmagus82"

464,"2014-04-14",3.4,"Brutally dark, no light even at the edges. The head doesnt go away. Looks like a cold pot of black coffee.

Aroma is cold mocha coffee with a touch of hazelnut. Really does have the most burnt-coffee aroma that Ive maybe ever had in a beer... but Im not sure I personally love that.

The taste has a sweet, nutty respite that isnt in the nose. Adds a rounded sweetness to what is otherwise a burnt affair.

Although the appearance is pretty formidable, the aroma is tremendously offputing. It is a mixture of caffeine after it has been through someones digestive system, with the acrid, bitter stench of the liquid that oozes to the bottom of concrete tanks where green & ripe coffee berries (they are NOT beans) are stored before selection. Flavour is not as bad and with much less coffee, and plenty of charred malts and bitter hops, making it closer to an oxymoronic Black IPA.

Appearance: Ink black body with no visible carbonation. Pours to a large, dark tan, frothy/creamy head which laces and retains wonderfully.

Smell: Huge nose of coffee and roasted malt.

Taste: It seems like coffee stouts are almost foolproof in a way. You take a stout, add coffee, and it just usually tastes really good. I suppose thats a really cynical way of approaching Bells Java Stout. What sets it apart from others of the genre is that the coffee flavor never fades and neither does its genuine hefty stout base brew. In fact, there really isnt much to critique the taste on - its a beer thats excellent in comparison to others of the style that are just plain good. What it comes down to is that its a little more robust and consistent. No aggressive bitterness, no sourness, no cloying sweetness. If I had to find a flaw - it would be that the palette is fairly simple. But, the flavors that are present are really tasty to say the least, so thats more than good enough in my book.

Drinkability: Another reason Bells Java Stout is better than your average coffee stout is its drinkability. The mouthfeel is soft and smooth with a silky texture and ridiculously easy finish. Theres tasty bitterness on the finish, but the aftertaste is a mild sensation of roasted malt and coffee. Theres no alcohol presence even at 7.5% ABV, though its quite tempting to binge on this brew instead of enjoying it as a liquid dessert.","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

464,"2013-11-28",3.9,"Bottle. Pours black with a light tan head. A lot of coffee and roast malts on the aroma, though not overpowering. The flavor is also coffee driven - indeed, Id say its closer to an iced coffee than a beer. But its not unbalanced, and there are a lot of nice chocolate and roasted malt notes. A bit more coffee-heavy than Id prefer, but a very nice example of the style. It reminds me of a slightly less intense Speedway Stout - a lot of similar character.","Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA","TOSG55"

This coffee stout appears dark brown in color, with a thin, eighth inch layer of beige head. The aroma is primarily of coffee, with a bit of roasted malt lingering behind. This is a decent brew, but not as full-flavored as I would prefer. The coffee and roasted malt are certainly there, but could be fresher, zestier, more aromatic, flavorful. The feel is medium bodied with adequate carbonation. This was an OK beer, but not among the elite coffee stouts.

464,"2012-02-29",3.8,"From notes.  First reviewed 1/3/2011.  Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a pint glass.

A very dark mahogany color with bits of ruby appearing where some light can sneak through. A creamy, bubbly coffee color head forms on the pour and demonstrates nice retention. Gobs of lace stick on the glass.

Tons of espresso comes through in the aroma, just an incredibly robust and full aroma. Some sweet molasses, roasted malts, and a bit of chocolate are present as well. 

The beginning of the sip has a soft molasses sweetness to go along with chocolate and roasted malt flavor. Strong espresso opens the eyes and really dominates through the rest of the sip. A light earthy hop presence at the end, but the finish is slightly sweet, mostly bitter, and all coffee. Simple, but enjoyable.

This has a big body and very viscous, and it drinks a bit larger than the 7.5% ABV. Very creamy, with a moderate level of carbonation. A little bit sticky on the lips. 

As a coffee lover, this has a strong appeal for me, and I find it very easy to drink. People who do not enjoy coffee as much will not like this stout.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

I had this and the Troegs Javahead back-to-back last night, and I definitely prefer this (albeit by a small margin). Theyre both totally different animals, however, and both great brews. Taylor tasted it, and she described it as a ""punch in the face"" (she preferred the Javahead). Yeah, its a punch in the face, but thats what I want from a java stout. This delivers, call me enchanted. Taste is nice and roasty, light bitter. Body really stands out from the Javahead, this is much heavier and thicker with a less pronounced light and crisp carbonation, definitely very big and chewy.

464,"2011-08-18",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 19, 2011 A great coffee stout. Its really all about the coffee... Pours black with a small tan head. Aroma is coffee - obviously - with a slight touch of vanilla and caramel, maybe a hint of licorice there as well. Taste is pretty much the same, a lot of coffee but with strong hints of cocoa bitterness and a well-balanced sweetness from caramel malts and brown sugar. Body is a bit lighter and not as creamy as your average american imperial stout but far richer than most beers, including most Belgians.

Taste is the same.  This beer is as advertised--coffee all the way.  Rich, strong coffee flavor.  Balanced well on the back end with sweet malts, which keep the coffee flavor from being overwhelmingly dry.  This is a coffee beer in a major way, though.  Bit of a dry finish, especially as it warms.  But overall, there is a balance of faint caramel and toast flavor to tone down the coffee roast.

Aroma is mind-blowing. One of the best.Surprisingly hoppy; bitter espresso, chocolate and chillies. This is how I want my beers to smell. Damn it. 

Taste is bitter-espresso, some wood, bells keep on giving me wood, chocolate, roasted malts, vanilla, chillies and hot mama source kick back you just want more of.

Damn fine stout with awesome balancing and fine bitterness. Drinkability is shit hot and one to get warm to. I would like to have more of this so I can do some blending with a Mikkeller Black Hole. Just a shame I dont have enough to be able to do this.

Stunning stuff Bells. Kick Out The Jams!

464,"2010-11-22",3.3,"12oz - Had a nice roasted nose, but the small head and watery (rather than oily) appearance wasnt appealing.  The palate was fine, but it seemed flaccid compared to other stouts, even their own Kalamazoo.","Ontario, New York, USA","AskForJenny"
464,"2010-11-17",3.7,"Bottle: Pours a nice dark brown/black, as youd expect. Very light beige head on this one - nice lacing, if nothing else. Aromas are of cocoa nibs, coffee beans, and a roasted character as well. Heavy coffee feel on this one - which gives you that bitterness but there is a nice chocolate sweetness at times as well - I say at times because it seems to get lost in the coffee element most often. Roasted coffee beans come through with the cocoa - Its one of the best java brews Ive had, to be certain.","Illinois, USA","Hair6a11"

This is an unabashed coffee stout, and a well-made one, even if Im not a huge fan of purely coffee beers.  Bittersweet coffee starts off and is followed by more bitter and zero sweet, the latter bitter notes definitely more from hopping than from the coffee.  Very slight pepperiness on the finish.

464,"2010-10-14",3.9,"UPDATED: DEC 18, 2010 Bottle.

A - Dark mahogany color with a little above average sized, frothy, sticky, creamy, light tan head. Good retention leaving a thin, creamy layer of lace.

S - Very strong roasted coffee/espresso aroma. Some smokey and tobacco aromas as well. Roasted malt and dark, spicy and earthy aroma as well.

T - Also contains a lot of coffee flavors. Both used coffee grounds and strong espresso flavors dominate the flavor. Pick up some strong smoky, tobacco flavors toward the finish of the sip. Some roasted barley provides a background, but for a stout, it is not strong. Burnt flavors show up mid-sip as well. Maybe just a little sweetness, but this is overwhelmed by roasted, bitter, and coffee flavors.

M - Fuller side of medium body with a nice level of carbonation. Incredibly smooth and creamy feel with a nice slickness. Great body and mouthfeel.

D - Decent drinkability, but the strong charred coffee and bitterness gets to be a bit much.

Notes: Definitely a coffee stout. Coffee dominates with not a lot else coming out too strong as it just gets overwhelmed. Went back and forth about how I feel about the taste, deciding that in small doses, its nice, but I dont really want too much. The smokey tobacco flavors are probably what really probably brings this down. The mouthfeel is excellent though. Worth a try, especially if youre a coffee lover.","Iowa City, Iowa, USA","FreshHawk"

464,"2010-07-17",3.7,"Pours black, with a relatively thin, moderate brown head.  Head is a bit frothy, but with little in the way of retention--dissipates quickly.  Aroma is absolutely dominated by coffee, with a somewhat sour character.  Some chocolate malts are detectable, but theyre definitely in the background.  Taste is of coffee with a mainly tart, sweet-and-sour character.  Some fruitiness, too--like cherries.  Not much in the way of burnt malts, almost porter-like.  Mouthfeel is a bit on the thin-side, but I wouldnt say watery.  Lively carbonation, but the effervescence is not overpowering.  In sum, this beer is somewhat uncharacteristic of many coffee stouts because of its almost porter-like presentation, but a very fine beer nonetheless.  If youre a coffee lover who is disappointed with that coffee stouts that privilege burnt malts, then give this one a try.  A grower, but I like it a lot.

464,"2010-04-22",3.9,"A- The body is jet black and is unforgiving even when held up to the light. An aggressive pour results in a very scanty head (less then 1/2 finger) that soon disappears. A very thin, dark tan collar is all that remains. No lacing is left behind in the glass.

S- Roasted malt is the first to hit the nose along with a ton off coffee. The nose basically says that I should be drinking this in the morning rather than past 11 PM.

T-The taste is much as the nose suggests. Initial flavor is medium strength and consists of rich roasted chocolate malt and coffee-with hints of a caramel sweetness. These flavors intensify for the finish and a sharp coffee bitterness is added. The bitterness soon subsides and what lingers is the taste of toasted malt, caramel,coffee, and the slightest hint of alcohol warmth.

P- Medium carbonation and mouthfeel is just a hair heavier than medium. The mouthfeel is not as thick as most from this style.

O- This is a nice, drinkable stout that I will have again. I was surprised that this wasnt a lower ABV stout-because it hides the alcohol well without being too rich. Job well done by Bells

It pours an inky black with a large, creamy, tan head.  Excellent head retention and lacing.  The nose is filled with coffee as you might expect.  There are also notes of earth, well roasted malt, and a bit of mineral.  The taste is loaded with black coffee (think french roast).  Its certainly not one dimensional though.  Nice notes of roasted malt, earth, mineral, and a nice malt sweetness help to provide balance.  It reminds me of lightly sweetened coffee.  The mouthfeel is medium-rich with medium-low carbonation and a long, coffee laden finish.  Overall I thought this brew was very well done and I highly recommend it.

464,"2010-02-18",4.3,"Pours a 2 finger mocha colored head which resembles the creme from cappuccino. Body is pitch black. Head retention and lacing are pretty good

Aroma is of rich roasted coffee beans. Smoky burnt malts are also present but really take a backseat to coffee. Hops are faint and alcohol isnt detected. 

Taste is similar to smell, big on coffee which I love. Rich, roasted, burnt malts are also present. This beer definitely went all out to produce the coffee flavors. Hops and alcohol are on the low side. 

Mouthfeel is good. Head stayed through most of glass and added a nice froth. Just wish beer was a bit more full bodied. Carbonation was also slightly on the aggressive side. 

Overall this was a semi sessionable beer. Very rich and full of coffee goodness. I guess the only downside to this beer was that there was nothing to balance out the strong coffee flavors. My favorite beers in the world Peche Mortel and Espresso Yeti both have some sweetness to round out the beer and make them more complex.

464,"2010-02-03",3.9,"Talk about coffee. Pour was dark black with a brownish/reddish head. Nose is fresh bean coffee and chocolate with banana. Taste was like drinking  straight coffee. A severe blend of espresso, americano, fresh ground bean and colombian, black...yet smooth and chocolate all the same. After taste remains dry with a slight bite. I would not have been surprised to have been up for 12 hours straight on this..Sometimes a brewer fuses two passions (coffee and beer) and gets it all wrong. Bells got it all right. The two have been blended well to go hand and hand and though its not something you could drink all night without getting sick, its definitely something Id turn to on any given cold afternoon","Brooklyn, New York, USA","BeerBlockaid"
464,"2010-02-02",4.1,"Bottle, This beer blew me away.  It pours a jet black body with a much taller and darker brown head than some other Bells stouts.  The aroma is of freshly ground coffee, roasted barley and a little peat.  The flavors are mostly rich aromatic coffee, and some playfully dark malts.  Nothing overpowering, and the bitterness in the dry finish was awesome.  Really brought out the tannin quality in the coffee and shored up the malts from getting chewy.  Very nicely done, and I am very happy to have finally had this beer.","Hyde Park, Massachusetts, USA","ElDuderino"

SMELL: If you like the smell of coffee then youll love the smell of this. Fresh ground coffee with some light chocolate notes as well and roasted malts.

TASTE: Not surprisingly this one tastes like coffee. Coffee up front and coffee on the finish. Not overpowering but just right. In the middle theres some light chocolate as well.

MOUTHFEEL: Smooth and easy to drink. Light carbonation. A somewhat dry finish.

464,"2010-01-24",3.7,"Enjoyed from a 12oz bottle in a pub glass.  The beer pours an opaque black color, with a moderate tan head that lasts in some form throughout the entire beers consumption.  The nose gives strong hints of coffee grounds, with some underlying roasted malt notes, and perhaps just a touch of alcohol.  The palate carries the marks of dark roasted coffee up front.  Roasted malt character follows, more aggressively than similar offerings from Founders and Terrapin, but not to the point that it destroys the palate.  Moderate bitterness follows, but again not to the extent that hop-derived bitterness or flavor detracts from the beers other qualities.  The finish is clean and neutral.  Overall, an excellent interpretation.","Pennsylvania, USA","Acetobacter"

This coffee tastes only OK, its not a show stopper by any means.  If you enjoy coffee this beer would be the best thing for you.

Aroma: The nose is full of coffee (as you might expect), with some underlying chocolate notes

Appearance: It pours a dark brown-black color with a thin head and some spottydrippy lace

Flavor: The flavor is heavy coffee and roasted/burnt malts, lightly sweet, and medium bitter

Palate: The body is medium-full, smooth coffee feel, clean, with a dry, roasty finish

Overall Impression: 
I cant say this one didnt need a re-rate, as it has been 4+ years.  I do think I rated this beer too low the first time.  It is a fairly one-dimensional coffee beer, but that one dimension is done fairly nicely.  Theres too much burnt coffee though.  To me, that still feels like a flaw.  
Score: 3.5: 7/4/7/3/14

Location: 12 oz bottle from Wine and Beer Westpark, 12/17/09 


Aroma: The aroma is all about burnt/roasted coffee

Appearance: Dark brown color with a thin, light brown head with spotty lace

Flavor: Taste is lightly sweet up-front, with a big, long bitter coffee finish

Palate: Relatively full body, decent mouthfeel, pretty dry

Overall Impression: 
This is not a bad beer, but it might not be my style.  This one tastes a lot like black coffee, but since I like my coffee with a little cream and sugar, I guess its not made for me.  Its a little too burnt in feeling for my tastes as well.  Anyway, its alright, but a bit one dimensional, as the coffee completely dominates this brew.

464,"2009-12-16",3.7,"Deep black pour with a thin string of tan/light brown head that sheets laces slowly as it disappears.  Potent black coffee aroma, with extra-robust, nearly-burnt Sumatran coffee dominating all other smells.  Even for a non-coffee-lover, the flavor is tasty.  Make no mistake, this isnt a chugging brew...the black coffee and loads of dark chocolate on top of chocolate malt flavors are way too strong for that!

464,"2009-12-16",3.8,"Bottle, thanks tarheels86. Pours thick black with a light brown head and tons of lacing. Flavor is coffee, dark chocolate, roasted malt. Big coffee flavor, I could slam these if they werent so expensive","Indiana, USA","tastybeer"
464,"2009-12-13",4.3,"12oz bottle (2009) into a pint glass.  Pours pretty solid black with some light showing through the edges with a half-finger milk chocolate head floating above.  The aroma is light chocolate and coffee mixed with sweet stout and a hint (jusssst a hint) of alcohol coming through.  The flavor is absolutely smooth and complex with milk chocolates, sweet roasted malt, a touch of sour American stout, and just the right amount of fresh coffee blended beautifully into the end of the flavor.  This is good stuff!","Georgia, USA","drowland"
464,"2009-12-10",4.3,"A: Black as night, with a small espresso colored head. Picture Perfect. 

S: This one has a wonderful malt smell about it. Of course there are hints of coffee, but you can also smell chocolate and a hint of spice, nutmeg maybe? 

T: Bells never ceases to amaze. This is another solid beer from their ever impressive lineup. The taste is wonderful. It is so simple yet complex. This beer has a taste of a perfectly crafted cafe mocha. The malt gives it a wonderful backbone and enhances the taste of fresh brewed dark coffee and chocolate. 

M: It is very smooth, creamy, with very little bitterness despite the taste of dark coffee and chocolate.","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
464,"2009-12-08",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 9, 2009 12 oz bottle courtesy of the Binnys singles rack (Orland Park, IL). A beer Ive been anticipating for awhile. Pours a near pitch black pour, a touch of very dark brown around the edges, opaque, a moderate dark brown head, that bubbles, stays decent sized, laces ok. Aromas are coffee, roasted malts, chocolatey mocha, with more coffee, and a bit of ashy smoke on the palate. Not bad. Initial is heavier bodied, a decent thickness, heavier coffee, roasted malts, dark chocolate, mocha on the palate, a touch of sweetness really sticks, but bitterness and roasty feel is very potent, but goes down nicely. A nice balance, largely roasty, but still  enough sweetness to make the beer quite quaffable. Finish is sweet and bitter, roasty with a solid ash and coffee dominance. Good flavors, not an overly complex stout, but certainly done very well, balanced, and tasty. Very nice!","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"
464,"2009-12-08",4.7,"Aroma is just like fine coffee with a smoky overtone - hardly like beer at all, but most inviting! It pours a deep opaque sable, nearly black, with a very thick, fine-bubbled tan head. Flavor is rich and very smoky, maybe a wee bit too smoky. It has a tasty chocolate undertone and hints of toffee and molasses. Texture is thick, smooth, fairly tingly, and quite satisfying. Overall, an immensely pleasing stout.","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"

Fantastic

12 oz. bottle batch 9436, bottled Nov 10, 2009.  Pours dark brown with a good-sized rocky brown head.  Leaves rings of lacing on the glass.  Aroma is a big punch o coffee.  Strongest coffee aroma & flavor Ive encountered in a beer...a little too much perhaps.  Some licorice, slight chocolate, and a bit of sourness round out the nose.Flavor is of course big on coffee, some chocolate, caramel, licorice, roasted malts, soy sauce.  Bitter coffee finish.Mouthfeel is pleasant, medium to full with low to medium carbonation.  Alcohol is well-hidden.I like coffee stouts a lot and had high hopes for this one, but it isnt as good as others Ive had.  The coffee is very overpowering which hurts the balance, and doesnt smell or taste like the highest quality coffee either.   More like day-old Folgers rather than gourmet beans.  Granted my bottles are extremely fresh, so Im hoping a few months of age may help mellow it out a bit.   This review is based on my second bottle, about a week after the first one and it is better than initial impressions.  The high price doesnt help either...

464,"2009-11-24",4.0,"Definitely looks like expected. Pours an almost black color. One-finger head of creamy espresso colored foam. Leaves a nice light swirl on top. Lacing is thin and somewhat slick.

Big dark roasted coffee beans, with that acidic tone of sumatra. Light hints of chocolate. A slight touch of smoke, and a very slight note of licorice. Predominantly, just huge coffee-ness. As youd expect from something called Java Stout.

The coffee is totally dominant here, also. But its not as overpowering as in the nose. Its a much nicer balance of flavor. Some nice chocolate notes can be found. A touch of smoke. A very light hint of vanilla. Some roasted malts.

This is a great full-bodied brew. Nice and thick. Very smooth, slightly sharp and a touch of creaminess.

This is one great coffee stout. I dont imagine that you could ask for more coffee flavor in a beer than this one. The smooth texture and balance of flavor make this easily drinkable, for me.

It is actually very smooth. I am surprised by the texture. Coffee flavor is very much in your face. Very big roast flavor. Coffee flavor is great, but it doesnt allow for other flavors to come through, but when you call a beer ""Java Stout"", what do you expect? A great coffee beer.

464,"2009-11-18",3.8,"12oz bottle. Pours a black body with a thin, brown head that dissipates immediately and leaves a light lacing. Aroma is packed with dryer coffees. Some dark chocolate and milk chocolate add a nice sweetness, but this is clearly all about the coffee. Flavor is more the same and very bold. Lots of coffee greets the palate along with a rich and milky, dark chocolate. A light nutty molasses comes in during the middle along with more coffee and chocolate. Finishes with a good amount of woody bitterness along with some roasts to dry this fairly quickly. Lots of bittersweet chocolate and coffee make up a lengthy aftertaste. Medium to full body, smooth, and slightly syrupy. Overall, this is a really nice coffee stout. The coffee is clearly the dominant flavor, but there is still a nice chocolate malt backing and a solid bitter finish. Really nice.","Woodridge, Illinois, USA","Pawola22"

Pours black in the glass with hints of mahogany showing through the edges.  There is an impressive two-inch tan head that hangs around as a small cap and leaves good lacing.

The aroma is like a coffee milkshake with a shot of chocolate syrup.  The dominant aroma is that of spent coffee grounds but there is an underlying chocolate malt presence that keeps the coffee from being the only player.

The taste doesnt quite hit the excellence of the aroma but, as a coffee lover, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Its got the dominant roasted espresso taste but its definitely got a more toasted character than the aroma, almost burnt.  There is a decent malty sweetness but the finish is very roasty and bitter.

They mouthfeel is on the fuller side of things and super creamy with soft carbonation.

Its complex, its super tasty, and it glides down your throat without effort. A commendable effort by a superb brewery.","Bolton, Ontario, CANADA","Slacks"

464,"2009-05-09",4.0,"There are a few breweries that are veritable powerhouses when it comes to consistently good craft beer. One of them would be Bells Brewery.


My Java poured black as night with a billowing head of foam which rises from her dark depths to proudly dominate the top of my brew. Where light manages to peak through, glints of dark earthen brown can be glimpsed while her head collapses in a series of bubbly pockets, leaving a dark tan blanket to mark her territory. Just as her head billowed and burbled her way to the top, so does her nose; coffee, a smorgasbord of chocolate, and espresso with fresh caramel crema topping her estery bliss. Warm notes of vanilla and cream temper the delicate notes of caramel sweetness as dry, toasty and crusty burnt malts cause me to salivate in delight. Enough of this nose thing, I want to make sweet love to her dark java stout depths. Our first embrace is soft with milk chocolate and cream, reminding me of a gourmet latte with hints of chocolate and caramel while coffee permeates every pore. Dry burnt malts leave each kiss dry and arid, creating an immediate thirst which is sated almost immediately. Delicate lace teases, seducing my eyes and body as we grow closer. Her coffee presence dominates while a naughty nip of lemon creeps into her finish. Whoever said parting is such sweet sorrow was obviously a masochist because parting is nothing but sorrow. As I bid my Java Stout farewell with a tear in my eye, my senses revel in a beauteous blend of rich chocolates, fresh coffee and cream, gooey caramel, and a whisper of wood while my body melts in contented warmth.


I love this beer. I could drink her all day long, but then I wouldnt have time to enjoy other beers. Suffice to say, Bells Brewing knows their beers and they especially know their stouts. Java Stout is an absolute success and I am happy to say that this time I have more awaiting me in my fridge for further scandalous affairs.","Vero Beach, Florida, USA","otakuden"
464,"2009-05-04",3.3,"This is batch 8256.

Appearance - Pours a dark brown with a 1 finger cappuccino head. Has wonderful head retention.

Smell - Smells like an over the hill coffee smell. Not the most pleasant of smells from a coffee beer that I have experienced. This scares me a little, wonder if this one has gone south...

Taste - Yup, this one might be heading south... The coffee is there, and is not very pleasant. A weird taste in there, cant put my finger on it; not a welcome taste. Tastes kind of stale. Maybe some rotting figs, I can almost taste branches too...

Mouthfeel - Great carbonation, wonderful mouthfeel. For the style, I would say this is damn near perfect. A nice and refreshing feeling.

Drinkability - I dont know, I wish I could have tried this when it was fresh. It is 2 years old now, and I just dont like it that much. I didnt finish the bottle.","Salem, Oregon, USA","josephselander"

Unmistakeable coffee aroma, coffee and cream, rich, roasty, cohesive. Very soft and creamy texture. High quality latte, but not espresso based, if thats fair to say. Light/medium milky sweetness. Light/medium bitterness of part roasted coffee bean, part roasted barley. To compare/contrast this with some other coffee stouts Ive tried, far less astringent than Founders Breakfast Stout, like drinking heavily creamed coffee vs straight dark roast. Less roast than Peche Mortel and shorter finish. This is such an easy drinking beer, very recommendable, although to be fair, the first half of the bottle is better than the second half as the bitterness does build up.","Medford, Massachusetts, USA","minch25"

Stout, however, pours a deep blackness with a thin layer of film. The flavor is a rich and robust blend of coffee bean and lives up to the title and description of the beer.

Chocolate covered espresso beans. Finish is light, delicate espresso with some notable dark chocolate, consistent with taste and aroma.

Coffee beans, black coffee, roasted coffee, espresso, coffee ice cream, bitter coffee, sweet coffee, charred coffee, etc., etc. All well balanced, great base stout, all that necessary stuff too. Either way, this is a coffee treat. Fun one.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"
464,"2008-08-26",4.7,"Simply stunning presentation. Pours pitch black and is topped with a deep fluffy chestnut brown head. The alcohol content is apparent in the way the liquid sticks to the sides of the glass. The aroma is full on coffee grounds. The beer is not shy, serving up loads of black coffee and bitter chocolate flavor, with a slick creamy mouthfeel. Sweet but tempered by ample bitterness. Very long aggressive finish.","Thomasville, North Carolina, USA","freekyp"
464,"2008-08-24",4.1,"Black pour with no red in sight.  A late forming dark brown head soon ends in a thn ring.  Very sweet coffee and chocolate defines the nose.  Flavor is coffee and milk chocolate.  It is quite sweet with a dry bitterness.  Very smooth and oily feel to it.  The beer seems to caress the mouth.  Its effervescence lights the tongue up late as the hops show up.  This is a straight forward beer and an excellent stout.","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"
464,"2008-08-24",3.9,"A nice java stout to something that doesn’t like coffee.  Pours very dark brown with dark brown / orange head.  The aroma has a mix of coffee, dark chocolate and roasted malt with coffee being up front, but not killing the other flavors.  Medium / full body that is quite smooth with some gentle carbonation.  The flavor starts with the aroma traits, but a bit richer with some dark caramel notes with a bit of spice and a hint of hops.  The finish has roasty coffee flavors.  Great for the style.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

464,"2008-08-18",4.3,"Thanks to Sammy for the Trade.  Simply phenomenal.  Medium roasted coffee beans scent.  Perfect black in colour with dark beige lacing head.  Tastes like roasted coffee, no surprise, not as strong as other coffee stouts I’ve tried.  Thick body, bitter finish, lingering lovely aftertaste.  Similar body to the Bell’s Kalamazoo Stout.  Bell’s really knows how to make a stout, and make it well.  Wish I could get some more of this in Toronto.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","BINGEBOT"

464,"2008-08-11",4.6,"Roasted coffee is the initial aroma.  Espresso to be exact, its very nice.  Also has notes of dark chocolate and malts with slightest hints of vanilla.  Appearance is an interesting one...dark black with a dark tan brown head.  It has carbonation bubbles on the sides, mostly on top and on the bottom.  Flavor is espresso, roasted coffee, and slight hints of chocolate and caramel (roasted).  Palate is extremely smooth and full bodied with aftertaste of a great espresso.  This is a great beer, a great example of why I love Bell’s.","Bemidji, Minnesota, USA","kosko20"

464,"2008-08-07",4.2,"Thanks to Crizay for my dessert coffee fix here.   Pours black with a medium sized tan-khaki head, dissipating somewhat quickly.  Aroma is straight up coffee beens, but more specifically, it’s like going to the bulk department and scooping a bunch of beans into a bag to take home.  That’s the smell.  It’s very earthy with a bit of toffee and dark chocolate, but it’s a strong earth smell more than roast.  Tastes really balanced with dark chocolate, chocolate milk, fresh earthy coffee, dirt, sticks, and toast.  Finishes with a slightly bitter roast, but mainly a smooth earthy taste lingering like buttered toast and lightly charred wood.  Medium bodied and medium carbonation, silky feeling.  Best thing about this is that it’s SO SMOOTH.  Amazingly smooth.  Usually coffee beers are the more abravise breeds of stouts, but this is really really good.  The coffee taste is smooth, earthy and as far from harsh as you can get.  Have I mentioned how smooth this is?  Just effortless.","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

464,"2008-08-03",3.8,"12 oz. Bottle.  Cellared for a year.  Pours an inky black with large bubbles and very little foam.  Aroma is intense with a blast of espresso and coffee beans.  Flavor mirrors the aroma to a certain extent and is definitely dominated by the roasted coffee flavors.  Some bittering hops and hints of vanilla behind all the coffee.  The beer feels strongly acidic on the tongue, but the body holds up nicely to mellow out the coffee.  Finishes quickly and leaves a slightly tart lingering sensation.  Having tried a number of ""coffee"" stouts, this one is about as potently coffee flavored as they get.  Bells has succeeded yet again in making another unique and memorable stout.","Arlington, Virginia, USA","Hoptagon"
464,"2008-08-01",3.4,"This poured black in color with a thin head and there was no hiding the coffee aromas and flavors.  It pretty much dominated the beer which made it rather simple but also well made and balanced.  Medium-bodied and smooth.","Wheaton, Illinois, USA","SQNfan"
464,"2008-07-29",3.8,"Bottle. No doubt about the strong coffee aroma in this, like espresso. Heavy notes of toasted and molasses for the the malt as well, with light dough and earth for the yeast, faint resin for the hops and vanilla in the background. Head is large, rocky, off-white with good lacing and is mostly lasting. Color is black. Flavor starts heavily sweet and finishes moderately sweet and lightly acidic and bitter. Palate is full bodied, between creamy and syrupy, and has a soft, bordering on flat carbonation. It finishes chewy and lightly drying. Im not usually a fan of coffee flavored stuff but the essence of the coffee married well with the other components of this Stout.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"

464,"2008-07-05",4.0,"Pours out very dark, with a nice tan head leaving a good lacing and plenty of head stays on top. The name says it all, this one definately smells rich of coffee. If you don’t care for coffee, it might be too strong, but to me it smells awesome. Taste starts with a bit of coffee, and then some sort of green flavor comes in, not strong, but I can only seem to describe it as fresh vegetables straight from the garden, then the taste shifts back into a bitter chocolate flavor before joining back up with the coffee for a choco-coffee finish. Med-high carbonation, thin little bubbles bounce around on the tongue, light bodied and pretty dry. Mouthfeel doesn’t say Double Stout, says more Irish Dry Stout to me. I imagine this would be nice just about any time during the day, breakfast would fit in well with this, but it becomes a bit cloying by the end, one bottle would be enough. Definately worthy of a try and I could see myself having more, but probably wouldn’t break my regular lineup.","Iowa, USA","badbeer"

For me, the taste is wonderful for I am a coffee lover in addition to my love for beer.  The dark, rich coffee flavor blends well with the light notes of chocolate and decent amount of malts, all hiding the alcohol taste quite well.  The malts actually gives me a hazelnut feel on the palate, which I truly dont mind.

But mostly its black coffee with a hint of chocolate. On cask this is a much better beer, its very smooth. I cant believe I forgot to do this review back when I had it. Alot of the bitterness is replaced by a balanced smoothness and some hints of cardamom.

Body is strikingly sweet.  I started drinking this slightly chilled and could barely stomach it, it was just so over powering coffee liqueur.  DRINK THIS AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.  By letting it warm up, the sweetness subsides a bit and more complexity in the roasted flavors comes through to balance out the sweetness.  Smooth mouthfeel and a semi-dry finish.  That was a close one, and first glance I thought I was going to have to give Bells a bad review.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","dmtroyer"

The taste did not quite live up to the nose, it was loaded with good coffee flavors but the spiciness of the nose never really materialized in the taste. Still this is a relatively small complaint, this was a superbly drinkable concoction. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy. The flavor was long with lingering mocha. Overall: I loved it.

Smell: Lightly chocolatey aroma with a bit of molasses and the strong scent of stale coffee. Theres a vague fruitiness there as well which doesnt really carry over into the taste.

Taste: Sweet, rich chocolate flavor with some sugar laced coffee. Then a roastiness arises and begins to build alongside an earthy bitterness. Eventually, the taste goes to burnt malts and scorched coffee, long ago abandoned in a glass pot on the burner. Starts off good but goes downhill quick.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Silky mouthfeel.

Drinkability: Decent enough, but outshone by some of the other coffee stouts available.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

464,"2007-12-24",4.9,"A: This was a bottle from batch 7768 poured into a Chimay goblet. It pours jet black with a thick mocha colored head that fell over the period of several minutes. A couple of drops that fell on the bottle were a good red color.

S: Im pretty sure a stick of chocolate dynamite went off in this beer because it exudes pure chocolate aroma.

T: This is one hell of a good beer. The flavor is insanely creamy and filled with TONS of chocolate and coffee. Sometimes I think about changing my favorite style to something else and then I have another double stout and that fleeting thought is immediately erased. It is perhaps a bit lacking in the aftertaste department. The flavor doesnt last long enough as it quickly fades.

Notes of a strong, dark roasted coffee are the first thing I’m picking up followed with some light charred wood.  Some light notes of chocolate are able to waft into my nose as well.   Taste is of dark roasted coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, and light floral hops to prevent this beer from being lop-sided.  Palate is amazing on this bad boy.  It comes on fairly strong with it’s flavor and then glides very lightly over the tongue.  An almost creaminess ensues leaving you to think the finish is going to be watery, but uh no, this beer doesn’t finish weak.

The foam shows excellent retention, and leaves patches of craggy lacing etched onto the glass.  Aromas include freshly crushed coffee beans, bakers chocolate, scorched caramel and roasted barley.  The flavor is built on the same theme, though it takes a turn for the more complex.  The caramel component is much more mellow and sweet than the nose indicates, as is the chocolate.  Earthy hops add bitterness, while a touch of anise lends depth.  Well balanced, with a medium-full, slightly viscous mouthfeel.  Finishes long and roasty, with an ever so slightly sticky remainder on the tongue.  This one reminds me alot of Mikkeller Beer Geek Breakfast, though it falls just short of its far more expensive Danish counterpart.

Some caramel was notable in the aroma and a bit of a grassy nature. The beer poured into the glass pitch black with a brown frothy and moderate head which fell ultra slowly to lace the glass. The flavor was very nice with coffee, espresso and any other coffee drink that comes to mind melded with dark bitter chocolate and roasted malt. The flavor was quite bitter from coffee, grains and more grassy and resinous hops in the background. Any sweetness was quickly mitigated by the bitterness. The finish was dry and nice with lasting coffee into the aftertaste and beyond. The body was just above medium-full and the carbonation was moderate. On the palate the beer was nice and creamy.

464,"2007-11-23",3.9,"Bottle thanks to NachlamSie. Poured at room temperature outside, 30 degree fahrenheit. The brew poured black with an abundant tan head that gave some amazing lacing. The aroma is of a mild, earthy coffee with some molasses and vanilla. The carbonation is light, creating a nice, smooth mouthfeel. The coffee flavour, as expected, is pretty dominant, though, it seems a little weaker than I like my coffee to be. Cocoa mixes in with the coffee very nicely. Brown sugar and molasses become evident as the brew sits on the tongue a little longer. As it passes, it becomes much sweeter. A coffee-like bitterness lingers in the background. As this brew starts to cool down, the coffee flavour becomes slightly weaker. The sweetness in the finish subdues a little as the bitterness becomes a little more dominant. Now at optimal serving temperature, the initial coffee flavour has become a little stronger again and has leveled out nicely with the flavours of the molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, and cocoa. I really enjoy this brew, and I especially enjoy doing these tastings in the frigid weather with the beer starting at room temperature cooling to optimal serving temperature. Its unique.

464,"2007-08-21",3.2,"Bottle #7768 (December 21, 2006) from john_adam2002. 9 months old. Aroma as if straight from a cup of coffee.  The liquid is much darker than coffee.  No head.  Medium bubble lacing on the glass edge that fades immediately.  Smell reminds me of Meantime Coffee Porter, which I disliked.  It is this memory that makes me wary of this beer, plus I am not the biggest fan of over-roasted flavors, especially if they are combined with acidity.  Let me write down the aroma and appearance score before they are possibly corrupted with taste.  Taste:  ahh, not as bad as I thought, much better than meantime.  Still very coffee flavor.  I think I dont like black coffee.  I like it with cream, and I like it with sugar, and I love it with cream and sugar.  Add a LOT of sweetness to a coffee, and I would like it much better.  Add a creamy texture, possibly from Nitrogen or some maltose late in the boil, and I think your in business.  Some excellent beers use coffee, such as Speedway, but the coffee flavor is more subtle, and after aging the coffee is even more subtle.  Chalk my low score up to my taste preferences.","Cupertino, California, USA","wetherel"

Taste is espresso, milk chocolate, and roasted malt. It almost tastes like a small bit of lactose was added, if so, not much. The finish is mildly sweet. I would have thought the coffee flavor would have lessened over the years, if it has, there was too much to begin with because it is seemingly a pretty large part of the flavor. There is a subtle fruitiness that you get with some the better coffees, maybe this is from the coffee, hops, or chocolate, I dont know. Thick mouthfeel.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Poured a viscous dark black with an inch of creamy light brown head, from a rather vigorous pour, into my Lucifer snifter. The head settled down to a small lacing that remained on the edges of my snifter the entire time. Aroma was awesome, Hersheys chocolate syrup, not straight from the bottle but the stuff that would remain on the bottom of your glass if you put to much in, coffee and upon warming some vanilla and even a sligh essence of wood. Flavor was fantastic lots of chocolate with hints of coffee. Mouthfeel was full but a little to astringent on the back of my throat where I wouldof liked it to be a little creamier for being only 7.5%.

Why does this sound so weak?  ..pleasant ..nice ..agreeable..  Because its a good solid beer that would make a great flagship beer or local favorite but not a beer that would stand up to the ""big boys"" that you can find with a little work.

464,"2007-06-07",2.5,"Wow. I dont get the popularity of this beer. I love good coffee and I love good beer. Unfortunately, in my opinion, this beverage doesnt possess the qualities of either. It pours a dark brown with a sizable, frothy, mocha head; pretty enough. The smell, however, is less pleasant. While roasted dark malts and tobacco sit in the background, the dominant aroma in this brew is wet, old coffee grounds. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, creamy, slick and soft with a bitter coffee finish. Sweet roasted malts along with faint chocolate and cream front a god-awful coffee finish. The finish makes me think of what it must be like to suck on twice-used burnt coffee grounds. Dump the coffee portion of the brew and youd have a very creamy and satisfying stout. With it, you have my least-favorite Bells offering.","Stilwell, Kansas, USA","Gregis"
464,"2007-06-01",3.1,"Rated 12/31/06:  Talk about deja-vu, I tweaked an oatmeal stout recipe last year and brewed up a coffe stout that was extremely similar to this one. Choked down about half the batch and ended up dumping the rest, just too many coffee beans used. This one is much smoother and tastier, but still not to my expected liking. Aroma is intriguing, lots of ground coffee bean to the nose but with a decent amount of dark malt to make it enjoyable. Dark pour, head soon diminishes, and no lacing very sub-par for a stout. Thin mouthfeel even a touch watery, happens more often than I allow myself to admit w/ Bells beers. Flavor is a solid blend of dark and roated malt with a ton of coffee, again just too much focus on the bean it really detracts from the decency of a good stout. I applaud the effort but not something Id spend my cash on again.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"

Pours dark, with a nice tan laced head. You can smell the roasted coffee from the first pour. The first taste is an immediate blast of strong java, then smooths out with the alcohol and co-mingled chocolate. There is a strong roasted java taste left on the palate after every drink. Although the coffee taste kind of kicks you in the mouth, its quite drinkable. Ive had a whole growler of this beer. A nice stout to occasionally drink, but not something I would put in the weekly rotation. If you like coffee stouts this is a must try.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","AllAboutStout"

464,"2007-03-15",2.8,"You know the smell and the taste you get from a cup of Starbucks coffee? That horrible burnt coffee taste and smell... That is exactly the sensation I got when I poured this beer into a glass and took a sip.

The beer pours a really rich, dark black color with a tan head that settles to an ever present ring.  Just looking at the beer, you get lost in its depth.  

That is where it stopped being a great beer and started the Starbucks experience.

The smell was that of burnt coffee and a malt undertone. I could detect a scent of another note, but could not place it. 

The taste was exactly what I dislike about Starbucks coffee. The beer tasted like cold, burnt and over roasted coffee.  The alcohol was easy to detect and the beer leaves a pronounced aftertaste that lingers in your mouth. As another reviewer stated, the aftertaste is like someone put their cigarettes out in a mug of cold coffee then handed it to you to drink. Not a pleasant experience.

As the beer is in your mouth, it actually feels a bit heavy, bitter and oily on your tounge. It leaves a coating in your mouth that adds to the negative experience of the taste and aftertaste.

I was a bit hesitant to buy this at first because I feared it would be a dark, heavy and bitter beer.  However, after my great experience with Bells Special Double Cream Stout, I thought I might enjoy the Java Stout.  Sadly, I dont think I will purchase the Java Stout again. I just could not get past the taste.

Im sure that it may be a really great brew for some and Bells does put out a quality product. I just dont think this complex beer is for me.","Redford, Michigan, USA","CanisFirebrand"

The hops sparkle lightly and give bitterness and roastedness. A little bit of copper pennies and metal in the taste and aftertaste, dries with peppery notes.

Taste is more of the same, thinner mouthfeel that finishes with a lingering coffee flavor that unfortunately starts to taste more like brew from Dennys thats been on the burner too long rather than a quality bean blend.  Not sure if its the overall concept or blend of coffee, but I think Bells should partner with someone more in the know on the beans side for their next batch.  Just like in beer, theres big and generic coffee (robusta) that can ruin the taste and it seems like thats the route this went.  A great concept, but needs a higher quality coffee in the mix.  This ones a rare miss from Bells in my book.","Olathe, Kansas, USA","mreusch"

Aroma is very fresh Colombian coffee, dried tobacco, evenly roasted malt and some hops, thankfully no citric aroma. Flavor is a bit of a letdown, just because the hoppiness present makes the coffee component seem bitter. Also tastes of slight tobacco, artificial sugar, more roasted malts. Flavor profile mellow overall. Palate is medium bodied, interesting because it quickly shifts at times from light to full bodied, like a rolling water or oil mixed in. Finishes soft with roasted coffee, off-dry. I didnt enjoy this as much as other Bells stouts but a good effort anyway. The slight bitterness kept this from scoring higher with me due to excessive hops for the gentle coffee and malt.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

Courtesy SoLan.  Dark brown/black in color, looks thin at the edge of the snifter.  Thin light brown head.  The palate was a bit thin for a stout.

464,"2006-12-10",4.5,"UPDATED: APR 2, 2008 Bottle.  Huuuge coffee aroma with lightly hoppy dark chocolate.  Motor oil pitch pour with a large creamy lacy dark brown head.  The alcohol is virtually non-existent in the nose - this could easily be confused with espresso in a blind sniff.  Medium body, thick, creamy mf.  Dry and bitter, as expected, but not cumbersomely so.  Light bg note of stouty sourness.  Creamy malt takes over a bit for the chocolate and coffee, though those remain the principle flavors.  The effect on the mouth here is remarkable - aftertaste is nearly exactly like that of fine coffee.  A wonderful, unique drinking experience! [4.1]I buy six packs of this every time I see it and drink it throughout the year - its clearly one of my favorites, and easily one of the most interesting beers Ive come across (of 1500+).  Theres no harsh alcohol, no extreme bitterness, no overdone hops; just lush, lasting, rich flavor, with complexity and memorable character.  After a few years of drinking this stuff, I have become an ardent supporter, and, more than that, a true believer. [4.5]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"

11/22/2006:  Color is as close to black as one can get without actually being black.  No lasting head.  Aroma is like freshly ground coffee beans.  Flavor is like drinking rich and robust black coffee while eating roasted coffee beans and a piece dark chocolate.  Needless to say, the finish is espresso like with some roasted malt, bitterness, and a touch of sweeter chocolate at the very end.  The mouthfeel is slightly thicker than average and smooth.  -- 

Im not sure whether to call this to call this beer with some coffee added to the brew or coffee with some beer added to the brew!  It takes so much like cold coffee that Im really leaning toward the latter!  This one is not for people who dont like coffee!  Overall this was an interesting and pleasing brew, but would have liked something a bit more complex in flavor besides just black coffee.  Maybe there is too much roast in this one to the point that it almost tastes burnt...

12/06/2007:  There is lots of MOCHA in the aroma as well as dirt and still lots of espresso.  When warmer, it smellls a bit stale.  The flavor is quite earthy and progresses from chocolate and coffee beans to caramelized malts, to a roasty finish.  When warmer, the oxidation really shows as the flavor turns to be more like dry cardboard and burnt coffee.  The beer is very dark brown in color with a tan head.  Overall this beer hasnt aged all that well and is definitely much better when consumed cold.  Its probably best just to enjoy this beer fresh or within a year or so...

I suppose this was almost black in colour. Aroma from old thermos coffee. How I hate thermos coffee. Luckily parsley and notes of cigar was traced, so no need to weep.

The aromas are of old coffee on dirty clothes (like my roommate getting home from work), burnt hair and the smell of espresso machines being emptied and cleaned.

Finish is sticky and dry with a lingering numbing sensation.  Like licking a beer flavored 9V.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","sneagrams3"

Coffee-like bitterness in the aftertaste with a touch of alcohol warmth.  Very nice balance.  I can see why this one seems a bit wierd, but it has to be tried to be appreciated.  This is an excellent stout.....especially if youre a coffee lover too.","Cincinnati, Kentucky, USA","zsb19"
464,"2006-05-09",4.0,"Pours out like 10w30.  Smells malty, slightly hoppy, and like a huge cup of Starbucks.  Taste is smooth and rich with lower CO2 being over powered by the large dose of coffee that this beer brings on.  Interesting, very smooth, very malty, is this a beer?  Its so close to tasting like a cup of coffee I almost wanted to warm it up and put some cream and sugar in it - just kidding, i drink coffee black - but still, this is really interesting, and I feel that drinking just one will not do it justice.  Glad I have several more to sip on when I feel the need.  Very nice though, and certainly very unique compared to anything I have ever drank.","weddington, North Carolina, USA","ross"

I probably couldnt differentiate between this and an iced coffee based on smell alone. Tons of coffee in the flavor also. I suppose there is some detectable malt characteristic which gives this a slightly sweeter side. Basically, this comes down to the question, how much does the drinker like coffee? Well, I love coffee. Especially bold and earthy such as is served up here.

Bells Java Stout is one of the most coffee-like beers Ive ever had. I still stand by that. Coffee is way up front, but many of the complexities are infused into the brew as well. Some creamy malts provide tasty balance, but this is all about drinking a nice cold cup of joe. This is a very well done rendition of the style.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

Hiding under all that coffee is some chocolate and a light sweetness.  Also some roasted malts and light smoke.  Flavor is like a nice cup of dark roast coffee, some malty sweetness, nut and some smoke.  Really a great mix of stout meets coffee to make for an interesting beer.  Thanks a lot for this one Paul.","Milton, Delaware, USA","TomDecapolis"
464,"2006-04-06",4.2,"Pours BLACK with a nice dense brown head.  I could not just justify giving this less than a perfect score for appearance, this thing looks like a monster imperial stout.  Smells like a really good cup of coffee with cream and sweet roasted malt.  Profuse swirling really releases some coffee grind smells that really proves its not just roasted barley in there.  The mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with little tiny bubbles, a little viscous.  The flavor is espresso, cream, sweet malty vanilla, and charcoal.  The lingering bitterness is not just charcoal but also that fruity coffee acidity.  I have to say, I was skeptical, but this beer proves you really can make a drinkable beer with coffee.  For as big as this beer is, I could drink a few!","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","pnista"
464,"2006-04-06",4.3,"Wow this is a good one!  Its entirely black, with a big dark brown head.  It smells sweeter than I expected- some vanilla in there.  Most of all, it smells like coffee, roasty, malty.  Its super creamy.  The flavour is similar to the aroma- still very sweet with coffee as the main component, but here now I get a hint of chocolate and more nuttyness.  The roasty flavours really linger nicely.","Bloomington, Indiana, USA","tcruicks"

464,"2006-03-21",4.4,"If you like the bitterness of a good coffee, try this beer. It was like consuming cold, chocolately espresso -- fantastic! It pours with a silky tan head. It appears midnight black; dark enough to obscure the light of day. The coffee flavor certainly lingers in ones mouth for minutes after each sip. This is a beer you want to drink by the fire after a nice meal, as more than a bottle in an evening would be excessive.","Fleetwood, Pennsylvania, USA","mhoster56"
464,"2006-03-19",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 9, 2007 [Rating update: this tasting is very similar to what I got from the original rating, but the quirks, especially in the aroma, seem less pointed. Bumping aroma from 6 to 7, and overall to 15. Not Bells best executed stout, but like the rest of the family, pitch-perfect mouthfeel.] Rich black pour with a fine layer of dense tan head. The aroma that hit me first is neither coffee nor the roasted barley character I expected: it is a rich, freshly tilled black earth smell, very wet and organic. Then some smoke and a touch of vanilla, raisins and kind of a bean sprout thing. Under all that, some coffee and black malt character. An overall appealing aroma, but also kind of odd. Flavor is a bit more of what I expected. Dark chocolate rounded out with a pleasant coffee bitterness. Still under those flavors I am getting a touch of something earthy and green. Not to the point of distracting, but it leaves the finish a bit less clean. Lovely soft and warming palate, like a bit of dark chocolate dissolving on my tongue. Overall, a pretty good stout with a few personality quirks.","Dry County, Arkansas, USA","Doppelganger"
464,"2006-03-17",4.1,"Pours very dark with a more substantial head than most stouts.  Foamy and tan.  Aromas are heavy of smoke, charcoal and coffee with a touch of chocolate in the background.  Flavor is much lighter than expected given the burnt wood aromas.  Chocolate and coffee are the dominant players, but there is also a nice vanilla/cream undercurrent that goes nicely with the silky mouthfeel.  The smokey charcoal scent reappears as a bit of an aftertaste.  Lovely.","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"

464,"2006-03-15",4.2,"You know, it seems that with any stout that decides to include coffee in the mix you suddenly get this whopping price increase as if coffee is this rare mystical ingredient. Similarly, you CAN find cheaper coffee stouts, but theyre usually lacking for one reason or another. It may just be me, but I think Bells really hits both marks with this brew. Pours opaque black with a medium tan head that reduces to a thicker film. The aroma is roasted coffee beans, dark chocolate, and more coffee. 
The flavor is a train of coffee, with some chocolate and some hazelnut...very roasty and nutty...and a very powerful flavor all around...no real weak spots. Very oily over the tounge with a bitter/dry coffee finnish...the aftertaste has a nice roastiness that sticks. The body is fairly rich and the overall experience is very warming. All in all a great brew served at a reasonable price.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","nolankowal"

The palate is robust and hefty with big chocolate malt, coffee, and roasty flavors that coat the tongue. Java Stout finishes with more chocolate and coffee up front, then ends with a big punch of roasty coffee bitterness that lingers on the tongue. 

This is the ultimate beer for coffee and stout lovers! Bells does it again, with a beer that is just so robust, and flavorful. Be careful with this one, Java Stout comes in at 7.5% abv, so coffee isnt the only jolt you will get. Coffee aromas and flavors dominate in this beer, its akin to drinking a shot of Italian espresso. It was a true joy drinking this beer. Java Stout makes the perfect early Saturday morning pick me up, and is an ideal desert beer. Match this one with rich and creamy cheese cake, or perhaps a decadent chocolate desert.

464,"2006-01-05",4.2,"Botlle courtesy of the generous pailhead: Pours to an opaque near-black brown, the topmost edges shining a medium brown when held to light, with a medium, thick & creamy light brown head.  The aroma is a quick prunes and apples as the glass is brought towards the nose, then thick roasted coffee grounds, espresso, roasted malt, mild scents of dark chocolate, dark molasses, and an underlying sticky sweetness that smells very much the boiling wort of a stout.  This smell is almost like if you took a scotch ale (not one brewed with smoked malt) and threw it in a frying pan to carmelize it even further, burning it just a bit.  The taste is that same sticky sweet molasses, caramelized & slightly burnt scotch ale, definite fresh dark roasted coffee grounds, bitter bakers chocolate, more coffee, caramel, a tiny hint of yeast, and yes there are some hops in there too if you hold it your mouth and search for them.  Its tough to judge, but Im detecting a bit of earthy pine/citrus, and theres a definite bitterness present throughout.  However those hops are fleeting before the roasted coffee and caramelized flavors take back over.  Finishes bitter and dry with notes of coffee, prunes, cocoa beans and light fruit notes that you would expect from quality coffee.  Medium-full bodied, pretty dry, moderate-medium carbonation.  Reminds me somewhat of Peche Mortel.  Very nicely done.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","BuckNaked"

Chocolate follows that w/ some minor graham cracker malty flavors and hints of raisins way down deep!  Well balanced and no where near as bitter as it smells.  Deep coffee/espresso notes at first, like drinking a lightly sweetened cup of coffee. A bit of sugary sweetness balances the dark malts to keep it from being undrinkably bitter.  Some brown sugar flavors as well as chocolate.  Finish is semi sweet like a Nestle chocolate chip with a lightly bitter coffee flavored aftertaste.  Medium body, medium carbonation, and smooth.

464,"2005-11-11",4.1,"12oz bottle. Pours dark as oil. and the head is a dark coffee tan. The best part of this beer is the aroma. Very cappuchino/espresso like, and chocolates, and roastiness, just absolutely amazing. The best smelling beer ive had yet. I expected this to taste as so too. Being my two favorite things, beer and coffee, in one bottle. It tastes great, malty, chocolates, cappuchino/espresso. No hops, but who needs it, in this brew. Just did not have the WOW flavor I was expecting, which I found in the aroma. Overall, amazing beer, well crafted, and even better balanced. Highly recommended.","Covington, Kentucky, USA","bethmatt0421"

464,"2005-11-03",3.6,"Bottle, snifter.  Dense, frothy and whipped browned-marshmallow colored head sits on a nearly opaque black beer that only yields to a deep garnet hue under the brightest of lights.  The head is mostly fading outside of a thick ring about the edges.  Aromas of French Roast and espresso are so strong up front that an element of charred oak is noticed.  Balancing that are the bittersweet notes of Dutch/Belgian puur chocolade.  Some bourbon is present, albeit without that alcohol sharpness.  Though, the aroma does have a vinous quality to it.  Raisins coated in brown sugar help balance the roastiness as well.  Much more simply: espresso + bourbon + Irish cream + Kahlúa.  The flavor does not live up to the aroma for me; it starts off with a mild sweetness like Folgers coffee and milk chocolate.  Theres a touch of grape tartness as well.  Some roasty acidity makes itself known towards the end but its still more of a fruity acidity/tartness.  A little dark chocolate creeps in at the finish.  However, all of those beautiful aromas feel damp and muted in the flavor.  I simply cant get red grapes out of my mind while drinking this beer and that really bothers me.  Medium bodied with a half oily, half watery texture.  Carbonation started fairly rough but has quickly descended to a soft level, more in line with what I think it should be.  Its not a bad coffee stout, but I feel the coffee element hasnt melded well out side of the aroma.","Tampere, FINLAND","wunderbier"

I had to swirl this one several times and enjoy the aroma.  Flavor is amazingly rich coffee just pure dark roasted coffee blended with sweet roasted malt, chocolate and caramel..  Amazing bitterness.  Smooth creamy palate.. amazingly full body for 7.5% alcohol.  This is a very unique stout and I have to say it is a coffee lovers dream..  This seems very underrated...

Rich, roasted coffee was at the forefront.. backed by bakers chocolate and some caramelly sweetness.  Burnt coffee provided the bulk of the flavor.  Chocolate also played a major part, and this brew was smooth and somewhat coating across the palate.

Deep hop bitterness up front with with a full bodied mouthfeel.  Tastes of espresso, black patent malt, and dark chocolate.  Only drawback I can see is maybe a little too lively in the carbonation department.  Finish is all Starbucks.

Poured dark, thick creamy brown head. Carbonation good. Aroma of roasted coffee. Flavor of mild chocolate up front, but the roasty coffee flavors are more present as it warmed and toward the middle of the brew. Very intense coffee notes.

Deep black with a head that remindmed of those snake firework things youd set on fire on the 4th that just raised up as they burned. This head just flew up once the pour was finished. Wow this actually tastes more like coffee than it does like stout. Huge coffee flavor that is so acidic it actually burns the throat. Ample chocolate and minor notes of roasted barley.

But, it was also pretty sweet.  I think if it was any sweeter, it might burn the back of the throat a tad bit.  The feel is great, not too thick or thin -- just right in my opinion.  They should start serving this at Starbucks - it would be a real hit.  It actually kept me up most of the night.  I wonder how much caffeine is in this sucka?","Boise, Idaho, USA","pinkzambia"

 Rating #765
The body sits a true black; and atop, rest a mammoth tan head. The aroma is a strange combination of bitter sweet sour, a slight spoiled lactic bitterness, yet chocolaty and round within the same sip. The flavor brings the same indications but with more depth. A great unification of oily coffee beans with the roasted chocolate malts they unite very nicely! I still get an astringent lactic bitterness. but I like it quite a bit! Nice roasted ashy malts a tad over kilned. Espresso with a dash of buttermilk. Am I crazy for drawing this impression?","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
464,"2005-07-12",3.9,"Coffee, coffee, coffee. Why not just drink coffee? Oh, yeah, the alcohol. And the roasted malts that are like adding one lump of sugar. The cream is in the mouthfeel.

Cigarette and roasted popcorn in mouth, some might call it roastiness, but something feels wrong here, it must have been heat struck because it feels like a mess, the round coffee flavours that were expected were all sparse and eclectic. Nicely rounded palate though, ironically. ////////////////// Had it again, this time on draught at the pub and it goes from 2.7 to 3.4. On draught @ the Eccentric Café. A lacy off-white head stays atop this straight black pour that is served a bit cold. Malt-focused offering where the coffee is not playing a solo. No beaniness helps I must say, but there is also a firm dose of chocolate. All-about Bells excellent malt extraction skills. Strongly cerealic, chewy palate that always manages to feel bigger than its size. Not very complex (no fruitiness noticed at all for instance), but just masterly done.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Rastacouere"

A daring and successful blend of stout and coffee, certainly, with the only shortcoming being that the coffee did not taste like a clean, solid, full-body roast that might accompany a clean stout.  Alas, I was trained on coffee before I freelanced into beer.  However, VERY well done, Kalamazoo, and the flavors blended better than I could have hoped for.  The hops were also well balanced.

Flavor-wise theres quite a mid and finish hop bite here to counter the sweet coffee and chocolate malts. Fairly mild carbonation, medium to almost light mouthfeel....coats the tongue thorougly though, and you can almost feel the caffiene kicking in!

This is too much java flavor, and I (like maltdog) consider myself a coffee achiever!  I dont often ditch a beer, but I gave this one 9 oz, then pitched the last 3.  Unpleasant beer.

So I drink strong black coffee routinely, but this just doesnt work here. It gets a little better as you plough through the initial first sips. Theres probably a good stout buried under that coffee madness.","Somerville, Massachusetts, USA","DrGonzo"

Definate coffee and chocolate tastes without much of a beer taste. Hmm, it almosts reminds me more of an iced espresso with a touch of chocolate and some carbonation.

I was not impressed with this stout at all and I got 22 bottles of this stuff left with no idea what I am going to do with it. It pours out black with a tan head and good aroma but its palate is terrible. Image this, a coffee pot which has over flown its filter and the grinds have made there way into the pot and now you are drinking them in your coffee. This is exactly my impression of this stout. I thought maybe it was just me and handed my glass to my wife who shares the same taste in beers that I do and she almost gagged.

This beer is far better when it is on the warm side, when it is cold it is far to astringent & out of balance.  When allowed to warm the sharp acrid roast coffee notes mellow & meld with the rest of the beer.  Has a strong roast component as well as a bit of chocolate in the taste.

Deep black body, the color of dark roasted beans, topped off with a fantastically tall head, creamy, luscious and mocha-tannish in hue, quite a sight. Aroma: a full immersion into coffee grounds is the best way to describe the encounter with one's sniffer. Some can't take it, don't like it, can't handle it...me, I find it perfect. Oh, so , perfect, such coffee, and that's the point, innit, chaps? Taste: fullest of bodies, little hop presence, thick, chocolatey malt, intensive presence on palate, with coffee taste richly resounding, never fading, lingering long. Yum, yum, yum...this is truly among my first rank of favorite stouts, of stripes and varieties, can't help it, it suits my taste, and to a J, for Java.

Chocolate chip base with cold extract coffee & acidic roast malt on top.  Good mouthfeel with a lingering bitter finish.

Black color with a short-lived tan head.  Wispy bubbles grace the surface.  Has a nice coffee roast aroma but it is hurt by a dusty quality.  The flavor starts with a sweet smooth malt and finishes with a hoppy, roasty bitterness.  Like the aroma, the finish is detracted by a dusty chalkiness.

At the Bell's tasting, the brewer indicated how proud he was of the ""seemless"" way the coffee mixed with the other stout flavors.  I think that he could not be more wrong.  There was simply no integration of flavor and such integration was badly needed, as the coffee flavor is so strong.  But I won't mind if you like it.","Annapolis, Maryland, USA","urbnhautebourg"

Smell is espresso coffee, a very deep roasted malt with some chocolate and sweet notes.
Taste is crazy coffee/espresso deep roasted malt tone with all sorts of sweet, bitter, tang, produced from a chocolate malt of some kind. there is some herbally fruitlike hops floating around on the back which was a nice surprise. Its full, rich, heavy, and silky smooth and packed with nice coffee/choclate flavors that are a bit overpowering at first in the bittersweet department and took some getting use to, but once it settles in, its fantastic. Makes for a great dessert beer and conversational piece to share with friends.

Aroma of strong coffee reminded me of coffee ice cream. Crisp and slightly effervescent with medium fullness.

Like stale wet coffee grounds.  I may not even finish this one.","Cape Coral Waterfront Wonderland, Florida, USA","BierBauch"

It's the same as the whole coffee bean aisle at the grocery store, not the weaker aroma of brewed coffee.  So, being that I like beans better than brew, the aroma of this is fantastic IMHO.  The same roasty coffee aroma carries into the flavor, finally I found something that tastes like the coffee beans smell.  If you like Founder's Breakfast Stout, you will probably like this.","Denver, Colorado, USA","AustinMilbarge"

Somehow, cold coffee just doesn't do it, aroma-wise.  Flavor is definitely more interesting and complex than the aroma leading to it, coffeeish to be sure but also bitter chocolate, nuts and some orangey hoppiness.

There are some roasted malt flavors, choclately and sweet, but they are so blown away by the coffee. Its like drinking a stout that has had some coffee added. I realize that that’s the effect they were going for, but it doesn’t really work well for me. There is a touch of bitterness, but I can’t tell if it’s the coffee or the hops. Despite its unbalances it’s very smooth. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter.","Newark, California, USA","beerguy101"

But I am being too harsh, at least they make lots of stouts, more than most breweries can say.  Again, a simple, smooth stout, with bittersweet coffee tones. 8/4//6/2/122004 bottle  After having Founders Breakfast, Kuhnhenns Creme Brulée and Péché Mortel, it was high time I rerated this one.  So here we go.  Roasty peanuts and coffee beans in the nose, a bit of bitter chocolate and some lactic notes.  Flavor is much more rounded than I recall from 2 years ago.  Theres more chocolate in this coffee stout, which translates to more sweetness and more balance.  Gritty, chewy, medium-full to full body, low carbonation.  Theyve certainly worked this one out.

Oh yes, it was full of coffee and yes it was Sumatra (one of my favorites), but this was thin, acidic, and unpleasant. Coffee is just not good cold unless it is sweet espresso, and this was not only cold it tasted like coffee grounds -  you know, that old, dingy taste that worsens with age like a burned out cigarette. It is imperative that a coffee stout have an equal amount of malt and roundness to back up the flavor, and this just doesnt.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","drismyhero"
464,"2003-01-04",4.0,"Another pitch black baby, but this time one with a nice head. The other November stouts have been a bit sluggish in this department. What starts out as lacing on the glass ends up being sheeting and was a little more difficult than usual to clean. Even left my lips a little sticky. The aroma and flavor are very roasty and fairly dry. The coffee in the beer does more to reinforce and complement the roasty malt than to actually pop in the flavor. A black chocolate is submissive to the bitter roast. The mouthfeel is a bit gritty. The sourness present in a lot of the other November stouts is only a ghost lurking behind the other flavors. This is probably the best of the groups offerings but it would have benefitted from a creamier mouthfeel with or without the grittiness.","Georgia, USA","aracauna"

464,"2002-12-12",3.9,"UPDATED: FEB 9, 2003 Re-rate; (revamping due to the the airy palate and phenolic notes)  Aged 10 months:  Huge aroma of shoe polish, black coffee, and tar.  The sponge-like dense foam could keep a Silver Dollar afloat.  Identical foam to Hercule.  Too much carbonation and lack of malt depth detracts from the palate.  Some notable flavors include: green olive, tar, and dry black coffee.  Coffee flavors are of low grade, but this gets points for staying aggressive, unlike Schlafly, New Glarus, and Redhook.  An atypical coffee stout.  Flavors have held up remarkably well.  This boasts a beautiful creamy head that sticks, huge coffee bean aroma, wonderful bitter chocolate and hop finish.  As it warms it seems to get harder to drink but leaves a nice malted milkshake-like aftertaste that is pure joy.  This beer was a lot of fun.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

464,"2002-12-11",4.4,"UPDATED: SEP 6, 2004 Re-Rate. 2004 GTM. Bourbon Java Stout. Chalky, milky (chocolate milk) aroma: 5. Light brown head, small. Opaque. Appearance: 4 Toffee, coffee, high alcohol. Burnt roasted malt. Very good. Flavor: 9 Palate 5. Overall 17. Original Rating: Came highly recommended by the beer guru at my local liquor store. Dark chocolate aroma (very little to no hint of coffee in the nose), with notes of dry pine. Huge, creamy light brown head with good retention & excellent lace. Dark, black body. Initially sweet, with moderate bitterness. More chocolatety than coffee-like, yet drier like coffee. I even detected a peat flavor. Surprisingly easy drinking for a big beer.

Aroma of coffee grounds,chocolate and a little more coffee.Palate is a little off,in a way I can't describe.Too sticky?Flavors of chocolate,roastiness,and of course the coffee grounds being the overall taste.Extreme coffee.Finish is bittersweet.There are some hops in there. Slightly acidic.Alcohol comes out in the end.I would say as it warms,but since I took it straight out of my closet that wouldn't be precise.This is something I look forward to every year.Why I gave a 18 overall score is beyond me,cause I don't like coffee.This sure does it though.","Evansville, Indiana, USA","raindog"
464,"2002-12-03",3.8,"Bells has really gone extreme java for this one - the taste reminds me of when I was a youngster and wanted some of my parents coffee (but colder) - they like their coffee sweet and creamy and this memory occured to me instantly while drinking this fine stout.  Color is black/brown and totally opaque.  not a lot of head, but some lacing.  This is delicious - I hope it doesnt keep me awake tonight!","Kent, Ohio, USA","Drew"
464,"2002-12-03",3.6,"A lot of coffee flavor in this one with an export style stout backbone.  Pours black, rich head.  Coffee, chocolate and roast dominate.  Very unique.  For the coffee lover.","California, USA","stephen"
464,"2002-12-03",4.0,"Wow! Extreme coffee bean aroma. I mean, thats all I smell coming off this thing. Granted, its a good coffee bean smell. The flavor was huge, intense, and relatively well rounded. I say relatively rounded, because I think Bells is really going for the coffee thing here. It definitely dominates the other malty, bitter, semi-sweet chocolate tones also present in this beer. Its nice. The beer poured a thick dark brown color and made a creamy, thick tan head that really coated the glass well. Did I mention that this beer is thick? One of the thickest bodies in a beer that Ive experienced. It leaves residue on your tongue that just wont go away. Although, why would anyone want to get rid of these flavors on their tongue? Marvelous job.","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"

I dont mean ""kind of like coffee"", it smells like COFFEE.  The taste, not particularly surprisingly, is of COFFEE.  TOO MUCH COFFEE.

464,"2002-07-28",4.0,"This is a thick, dark stout.  The was rather large and a medium to dark tan color.  Amazing coffee aroma complimented ever so slightly by the chocolate malt.  It almost looks like some coffee grounds are floating on top.  The more you drink, the more that seem to appear.  The flavor is full of coffee, chocolate, some nuts, and some good roasting.  The more one drinks, the longer the finish lasts.  I dont really like coffee, but this beer was excellent in my opinion.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

464,"2002-02-28",3.9,"I wonder if I bought a bad bottle of this beer.  Overall this stout was better than average, but I noticed a few glaring flaws.  First, there was a perceptible musty flavor (didnt note it, however, in aroma).  Second, I didnt think the coffee was well-balanced with the hops and malt; I would have preferred more subtle coffee flavors.  Still, on hunting camp weekends, this would make an excellent morning beer!","Ferndale, Michigan, USA","Inveigler"

A nice roasted malt taste marries well with a light coffee flavor.   A brief bitterness is left in the palate along a sustaining java presence.   Very well crafted!
