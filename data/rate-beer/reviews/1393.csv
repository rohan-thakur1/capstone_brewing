1393,"2011-06-09",3.7,"Eigener Antrunk, dominiert von einem dumpfen Hopfenton. Im Mittelteil grasiger, der Hopfen wird aromatischer und bleibt dies auch. Vollmundig aber eher unsüffig scheint das Bier hier zu sein, hintergründig mit einer Vielzahl von Aromen. Auch das Malz befindet sich hier noch im Hintergrund und kommt erst im Abgang zur Geltung. Immerhin setzt es hier direkt intensiv ein, hat aber gegen die Hopfigkeit keine Chance und muss sich mit Platz 2 zufireden geben. Untypisches und voluminös hopfiges Dunkel.
