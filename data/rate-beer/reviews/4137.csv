4137,"2014-04-28",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 3, 2015 Bottle. Pours blood red, no head. Great legs on the glass. Aroma is a mixture of raspberry jam and honey. Tastes amazing. Sweet honey and fresh pureed raspberries. Just a touch of booze in the finish is perfect to counter the sweetness. Great syrupy mouthfeel. This is supposed to be a sipper but I could easily just slam this stuff. I really wonder how this stuff would develop with a couple years in the cellar.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"

The taste is pleasingly similar with rich nectar like honey sweetened raspberry fruit where you can taste several raspberry fruit nuances like the skin, seeds and meat. Wow.

Pours a deep ruby crimson hue, some darkness in the middle and Zinfandel and reddish glow tapers out to the edges and bottom. Loose bubbly head dies to a mellow ring, laces slightly. Aromas are richly and unapologetically raspberry. Lush and seedy, jammy fruit is tart and sweet, the honeywine element falls behind as this nose is just heavenly. Raspberry, seedy and pulpy berries, a bit tart and juicy. Wow. Initial is medium bodied, firmly fruity with raspberry, apple, some honey. A bit fuzzy, gentle tannic berryskin, seedy raspberry, some gentle tartness. Some honey, apple, gentle sweetness. Middle is a touch sweet, continuing, sustained flavors. Backend is a bit more honeywine elements, some gentle tartness, subtle tannic nature meets seedy and pulpy raspberry. Finish is a bit slick, honey and raspberry, touches of that juicy front end is still lingering. Again, a ridiculous nose and front end. Quite lovely.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","TheAlum"

Had again at Schramms meadery, new batch. Enjoyed it even a bit more this time. Less of an abrasiveness, more smooth raspberry flavors. Jammy & delicious. Still prefer the blackberry, but the newer batches of raspberry are getting better. Schramms is killing it on the mead front. Very good stuff!","Michigan, USA","tectactoe"
