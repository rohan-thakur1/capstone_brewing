Flavour is super complex, with amazing depth of dry apples, champagne, caramel and treacle toffee. Warming in the best way possible, with a treacle, champagne-like finish. Fantastic stuff.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"

2926,"2016-08-12",3.9,"(10.5%) Cur de pomme, pelures et chair légèrement abimée par un air de campagne. Pommes entières dun verger tenu par des moines. Le fruit rond tient dans la paume de ma main qui travaille dans une terre sèche. Lalcool est complètement oublié. La viande blanche est juteuse et légèrement sucrée. Cest la beauté du fruit défendu. Bulles éclatantes et éclatées. Derrière le goût, les pommiers dans une érablière qui nattend certainement pas le printemps et le précieux travail des abeilles.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

2926,"2015-02-23",3.9,"2015-02-15. Crispy dark yellow body with a small off white foam. 3+ Aroma is lovely - like smelling a basket of freshly picked apples. Sweet with a touch of apple skins but more in the sense of fresh ripe apple skin than the rougher note that description can sometimes imply. Flavour is relatively sweet but not cloyingly so, lightly syrupy sweetness alternates with fresh apple character (sort of Macintosh like?) and a light acidity that brings balance, and just a kiss of earthy apple notes in the finish. Just a touch milder overall than my preference but pleasantly subtle and nuanced. Smooth average plus to medium bodied palate, soft carbonation.3+ Just different enough from other ciders to be very interesting. I bought a bottle to bring home, hopefully it lives up to my first impressions. Bottle at Mondial des Cidres, Montreal.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
