4298,"2012-05-10",3.7,"Pour from a 12 oz bottle. Medium gold brew with white head. A little cloudy. Good lacing. Aroma of malt, noble hops, hints of spice and crisp fruit. Taste is a fine clean but light maltiness with a very well balanced hops finish. As per the style, taste is not extreme but is clean and well balanced. No hints of corn or rice, and quality hops. A really excellent brew.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","Onslow"
4298,"2010-12-06",3.6,"(12oz bottle courtesy of BBB63).  Pours hazy dark yellow with white head.   Active carbonation.  Aroma of wood, florals, and honey.  Taste is sweet with a little hop bitterness at the end.  Medium bodied with an oily texture.  Finish is bitter, but not over done.  As it warms, I get more honey and some ripe melon with a bit of citrus in the hops. This is a pretty nice beer.  I would probably search this out if it were available locally.","Scottsdale, Arizona, USA","dcschiller"

4298,"2008-03-14",3.7,"Bottle thanks to Mike!  Poured clear, brighter golden with a tall, foamy cap of off-white head.  The aroma picked up soft, sweet bready notes accented by pinches of grassy hops and lemon zest.. well-balanced and well-presented.  The flavor had a sweet biscuit and pale malty backing with high levels of herbal bitterness and the aforementioned lemon zest.. the spicy, tart finish was very refreshing.  Lighter-bodied, well-balanced, and refreshing.  I could drink a lot of this over the summer.","Pewaukee, Wisconsin, USA","Ughsmash"
4298,"2008-03-11",3.5,"12oz bottle, no date.  Clear yellow golden with an ample two finger fluffy barely off-white head, great retention.  Biscuity malts with some sugar cookie up front with a little bit of earth and zesty citrus hops in the background to keep it from getting sweet.  Unsalted saltine crackers show up after this warms minimally.  Flavor is more earthy with no sugar cookie presence--it seems to be all biscuits and saltines.  Earthy bitterness lingers in the dry finish and peaks at a 3-4 at the back corners of my tongue.  Overcarbonated--the beer just foams in my mouth and takes away from the flavor--with a medium body.  It started out great, but went downhill after the aroma.","Ocean Beach, San Diego, California, USA","iowaherkeye"

Some very faint lacing was left around the glass.  The aroma of the beer was made up of sweet malts and some light pine and grass.  The flavor was sweet malts, biscuit, and a mild noble hop finish.

In the aroma, a mixture of elements cross my mind such as sweet malt and a fruity hop smell that reminds me of an herbal essence shampoo scent.  Flavors i note are minor tastings of malt, caramel, honey, and a light floral serving of hops. A mellow drink that finished off buttery and easy on the palate.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"

4298,"2004-05-07",4.2,"A great Helles - If anyone ever wants to know what Tettnanger tastes like, steer them to Nothern Indiana - I procured a sixer from CityWide in Mishawaka; a pretty good little beer store. This is a super pale malty, highly yeasty rendition (slightly acidic, citric) - lots of country hay, great body, make sure to drip a few drips back into the bottle and swirl all the residual stuff back into your glass; makes the beer softer and fuller. No traditional malt sweetness; this is grassy, dandeliony. Almost to Dominion Lager and Victory Helles and Burgerbrau Wolnzacher territory; yes, its that good and Im a freak for this style. Actually, a lot like Ciscos Summer of Lager, another great one! Some quality inconsistency within the six pack, but not much.","Łódż, Warsaw, Poland; Michigan, Ohio, USA","Schroppfy"

4298,"2004-01-15",3.3,"This hazy golden-bodied lager is topped by a thin off-white head.  Following the somewhat grassy, fruity aroma is an interesting flavor of various fruits (melon, molded peaches) and grassy hops that leave a lingering bitterness on the palate that somewhat detracts from the sweet, fruity malt characterics and perfumey nature of the otherwise light body.  Rather unique, a toned-down hop profile would benefit this lager.  Thanks Mike (BBB63) for the bottle!","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
4298,"2003-11-26",2.1,"vibrant golden french fry color, not much head, but far from dead.  aroma of cantaloupe or pumpkin guts, dirty kitchen towel, and a little medicinal.  not attractive at all.  watery body with soft carbonation lets the composting fruits and strange bitterness seem like punishment-- even on a thirsty tongue. like sugar water on dried grass. it may be 'off'-- or maybe I'M off --off my rocker.  i opened a saranac pale  just to be sure i wasn't imagining the whole thing.  i wasn't.  the back road is simply dank and plain.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"

It had a mild malt lager type aroma with a smooth mild mouthfeel that had no bite in the finish.  The flavor was mellow with notes of mild hops.  It does go down very well and is still a quite nice beer.  A special thanks goes out to their brewmaster for his hospitality and a fine tour of the facility.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
4298,"2003-09-24",3.7,"UPDATED: OCT 5, 2003 Wow I get to be the 10th rater of this beer that Bigbadbear63 sent me from Indiana, Thanks Buddy!  This Millennium Lager poured a large but short-lived head atop a golden copper body. The aroma is Very fresh and crisp, What is that implausible smell???? Maybe its honeysuckles and freshly baked honey cinnamon bread? Im at a loss for words with this Lager? The flavor has a big but light malty presence, not nutty but more like peaches and apples. Its a bit toasty and herbal but Peach juice notes for certain, apple cinnamon applesauce, yes thats it! I detect a nibble of the hops in the crisp finish; its delicious. I find this brew pretty complex for a Lager.  Mike, great choice, I like this one very much.","Tampa, Florida, USA","matta"
4298,"2003-09-10",3.4,"Dim golden peach.  Microscopic ring of tight bubbles.  Ale-like estery aroma coupled with hopsack, peach skin, and mineral-like aspects.  Traces of jellied malt, tea leaf, perfume, spruce, cracker, and assorted tropical fruits.  Round mouthfeel.  Still, large bubble carbonation.  Starts unusually hoppy and spicy, with round notes of star anise, almond extract, and evergreen.  The hops are met by a resilient malt backbone and a flock of esters, which keep the bitterness at bay.  The hops are borderline numbing.  Biscuity malts are here, but are continually pounced by the coarse hop textures and fruity esters.  Its got a satisfactory aroma, but hardly lagerish.  The interplay, albeit extremely subdued, of what seems to be pale and munich malts, was nice.  Its probably past its prime, but its undated.  Its not the least bit elegant, but whatever it's supposed to be, its respectable.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"
4298,"2003-08-31",3.2,"Had a nice chilled bottle of this at Aofoxxy's little gathering last night.  Pours a clear light golden.  The thin white fizzy head is mostly diminishing with no lacing.  The nose is grapefruit and cereal, flowers and perfume - exceptional for a lager.  The brew has excellent balance and depth for the style - almost dortmunder speed, one of the boldest lagers I've sampled to date.  The light and creamy body is soft and finishes crisp.  Once the brewers figure out how to present a head this will really be something.  A nice offering, thanks BBB.","Alverca, Lisboa, PORTUGAL","ultraspank"

Original review: At Indiana BG Fest: Slightly different from the bottled version, it was golden hued and a bit hazy with a nice head and some lacing.

4298,"2003-01-05",3.6,"Pretty wild - yeasty, orangey flavors surface through the more traditionally beery ones in this lager.  I started out disliking it, but I really warmed to it and ended up thinking it the best of the trio of Backroad products I brought back from Indiana.  This brewery is interesting, with seriously hard to classify brews.  Their Pale (Backroad Ale) is decidely unAmerican, their amber (Maple City) tastes a lot like my homebrewed Alt, and this thing sneaks witlike tones into a big lager.  Lets take up a collection and send one of the style gurus to northern Indiana!","Fountain, Michigan, USA","hennes"
