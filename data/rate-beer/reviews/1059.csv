1059,"2017-01-13",3.5,"Sample at West End Ciderhouse. Pours a crystal clear very pale yellow color with a thin white head that burns away quickly to an outer ring. Spotty lacing. Apple and pear aroma. Light-bodied with flavors of pear, floral honey and apple. The finish is fruity and semi-dry with a pear aftertaste. Decent overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"
1059,"2016-12-25",4.1,"500 ml bottle from Louisville Beer Store; shared with Boo; MMXIV bottle date; ABV at 4.8%. Aroma: Bittersweet pear juice that meets spicy, cinnamon-like spice in near balance; some lesser caraway-like notes. Appearance: Sparkling, transparent pale yellow with carbonation resting on the sides of the glass, and in a constant stream from its base. Flavor: Juicy, semi-sweet pear up front with an underpinning of spice; spices reminiscent of fall take over towards the finish, leaving only a little lingering sweetness. Palate: Medium body, sticky texture, lively carbonation, lingering finish. Overall: Exceeds expectations all around; truly a wonderful Christmas-time treat. Another excellent E.Z. Orchards offering.","Louisville, Kentucky, USA","ContemplateBeer"
1059,"2016-11-03",3.8,"Bottle. Pours a very light yellow-green with lots of visible carbonation. Nose is intensely aromatic; pear, lime, dogwood, orange blossom, ripe cherries. On the tongue, its like being punched in the mouth with a barrel of ripe pears; intense, piercing, and omnipresent. This is pear, DAMN IT. Theres skin, and fruit, and even a little seedy bitterness, and Im surprised it doesnt have that grainy texture. One of the purest expressions of a fruit Ive ever had in a cider. Finish is drier and acid-clean. Wow.","Austin, Texas, USA","degbert"
1059,"2016-06-08",4.0,"Aroma is pears, fruit/fruit peel and a hint of sweetness. The flavor is pears, fruit, effervescent body and a mix of mild sweetness and dry/tart in the finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
1059,"2015-06-18",3.9,"Poured from bottle to glass. Straw hue with no head. Honey, pear, straw. Mouthfeel is great with a light body and crisp carbonation. Taste is sweet with a mellow finish. Overall this is a nice Perry.","Sweet Home, Oregon, USA","Salmoniform"
1059,"2015-01-02",3.4,"Bottle. Poured clear light pale color with a minimal sparkling white head that mostly diminished with virtually no lacing. Medium green pear fruit aroma. Medium body with a thin smooth dry texture and sparkling carbonation. Medium sweet pear flavor with a medium sweet finish of moderate duration. Worth having more then once.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","Tmoney99"
1059,"2014-12-28",3.6,"Pint bottle from Dutchs, shared with friends. Hazy pale whitish, mildly yellow color. White bubbly head quickly fades to nothing. Medium plus body. Smooth, kind of chewy full body. Lighter, kind of soft carbonation. Nice dry finish. Really nice midlly peppery pear aroma, with lots of the skin-type flavor in there I feel like, which I really enjoy. Good amount of bitterness and dryness -- not too sweet at all, and definitely not sugary or sweet (a thing I always hate about ciders). Really one of the best (pear) ciders Ive had. One of my new favorite cideries. Moderate sweet taste, nice light to moderate bitter, lightly spicy, and good dryness towards the finish. Wonderful stuff. Ive never been a cider fan, but if I was going to be one, this would be my brand.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
1059,"2014-12-18",3.5,"375 ml bottle shared by DrSilverworm- thanks again, Chris! Pours a pale, clear champagne color with some bubbles around the edge. Aroma of pear, apple, funk, sugars, and oak- really nice and crisp and tart and clean. The flavor, though, is a sort of dry melding together of all of that, and things get washed out a bit. Light-bodied, with medium carbonation and a dry, almost mineralic mouthfeel. Doesnt quite deliver on the promise of the nose, but still pretty nice.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
