Light body, almost in watery territory. Moderate carbonation. Herbal/hay finish. Subpar mouthfeel for Tree House (which is usually their force). Its not bad and its super easy drinking but its not top-50 material in the Golden Ale/Blond Ale category as you can get much more crackery malt depth in a ton of British golden ales.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"

2090,"2016-08-31",4.3,"Canned 8/18/16, shared by Blisscent on 8/25/16.Big, fluffy, white head showing good retention, tops a moderately hazy, brightly glowing, tangerine-golden body.Quite a bit less explosive/lush than its Nelson/Galaxy/Mosaic brethren, though its too be expected as citra is a bit less juicy/all-encompassing than those other hops. However, what it lacks in aromatic force, it seems to make up for in subtlety. Interesting sweat/funk is well-controlled and never takes on any cat urine, while nectarine skin, lemon juice and lightly juicy red grapefruit notes all sit elegantly atop a soft, biscuity maltiness that reveals very light honey notes with warming. Light peach, white grape and more minerality unfold over time, and theres neither alcohol nor flaw to be found.Lightly juicy with tangerine, lemon and orange rind up front, followed by light sweat, grapefruit rind and a touch of ripe nectarine. Ample bitterness, but of course the beer is wonderfully balanced with a tight carbonation, high attenuation and soft, malty texture. Strong minerality very nicely juxtaposed with the citrus and light juice from the hops, on the finish. Cracker and biscuit behind it with no alcohol or flaw.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The pour is a foggy gold color with a hint of orange shining through. There is a nice white head that falls to a ring, leaving spotty lace. The aroma is pretty much all juicy hops. There isnt a lot of blonde ale characteristics in the nose, which Im a fan of. Juicy citrus I love. There is a nice dankness as well. The flavor is good. Lots of dank tropical fruits. There is a little blonde ale in the background, but the dank hops and fruitiness dominate it. The mouth feel is great. Light and crisp, with a nice, well carbonated finish.

2090,"2015-11-22",4.0,"Misty, golden kiwi yellow, totally clouded. Muted aroma of white peach, lime zest and lavender. Feathery cracker malt touch, fresh grasses, and a dash of minerallic water. The flavor offers a bit more complexity, with some white pepper and raw garlic augmenting the soft fruit and grass hop character. It has a limestone quality, which leaning against the lemon and lime pith stuff can be kind of papery. But the herbal, spicy zip that carries through is really fun being paired with the sharp, snappy pale malts. Lean but sumptuous mouthfeel, fluffy and soft. My early impressions were based on this being too cold, and as it reaches the proper temp everything is finding its right place.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Stine"

Smells of crisp citrus, together with lots of juicy oranges among light, bready malts. The flavors come well together, while they do not provide too much depth, revealing the beers light body.

Has a medium carbonation with a very light body to it, providing enough flavors to exhibit a satisfying taste.

Tastes of fresh, fruity hops, defined by orange peel, some lime and bready malts, which turn sweeter, as the fruits do. Has a pleasant dankness to it, due to wet grass, enhancing the depth of the fruits effectivly. The beer is very soft and light on the palate, while its aqueous qualities are perfectly entangled into the juicy, light fruitiness. Finishes with orange lemonade, biscuit malts and a very enjoyable, enduring fruitiness. The hops are there till the end, they dont turn very bitter though, as they carry the beers very enjoyable fruitiness relentlessly.

2090,"2013-12-28",3.8,"Yet another winner. This is a very drinkable session ale. The aroma is mild yet assertive. The taste is citrus given the hops but with a nice yeasty overtone. This is a wonderful combination of APA and golden ale.","Madrid, SPAIN","CamdenD"
