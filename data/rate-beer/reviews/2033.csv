2033,"2017-05-22",3.5,"Poured into a mug, the appearance was a murky brown color with a fingers worth of white foamy head that held and dissipated at a good pace. Lace clung effectively.
The aroma had some sweet and roasty pecans, mild cake, milk chocolate, sweet dough, some coffee beans, a touch of vanilla and had some earthy bitter hops at the end.
The flavor blended all of this fairly nice. Sweet to roasty to bitter and clenching the aftertaste pretty nice. Mild sweet and bitter sort of finish.
The palate was about medium on the body with a good sessionability about it. Carbonation felt good. ABV felt good.
Overall, pretty good brown ale that I could have again for me, but I didnt get all of those extra hoppy notes that they said they put in this.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

2033,"2017-05-08",3.0,"1 pint can from middle of 2016. Pours a hazy brown shade with white froth. Aroma is of floral and grassy hops but not fruity in nature, and some malt - dough, and bread. There are very faint notes of coffee in the aroma - perhaps due to the age of the can - which are not too prominent. Taste is exact opposite of aroma, strongly dominated by the roasted Kenyan coffee, over biscuity and bready, flavours of the malt, but next to no hops flavours at all! Mouthfeel is a bit thin and watery, reflective of the rather weak underlying brown ale, which manages to stay afloat solely by virtual of the dominant coffee flavours.","","the_beergery"

Aroma is rich and dense and has dark chocolate or cocoa, marshmallow, mixed nuts, rye bread. Palate is perfectly balanced and is not too oily or dry. Taste has slight bitterness and a surprising herbal taste which is like cough drops mixed with Jägermeister. Additionally theres hops (the bitterness) and some ""ale""-style malt making up the body. Surprisingly I taste no coffee, even though its supposed to have it. Theres a perfect balance of sweetness and bitterness. The taste is more complicated than what I could describe, but its difficult to pick up flavours. Its a very good beer though and I would definitely buy it again.

Not a bad brown ale at all. Nearly a coffee porter or stout with the darkness of the malt, but with a somewhat lighter body. Im not sure how old this bottle was (come on folks, is it that hard to put a damn bottling date on the label?) but I have a suspicion that the hops were a little muted with age - Id like to try this fresh or on tap and see if theres a bit more hop presence.","CANADA","UXO"

2033,"2012-09-24",4.0,"Bottle, bought @ Fanø Bryghus. Pours deep brown that is almost black. Large creamy off-white head. Aroma has sweet caramel, light chocolate, firm roasted coffee. Medium to low carbonation, super lovely creamy mouthfeel. Flavour is sweet, malty, caramel, light chocolate, walnuts. The coffee is very prominent and firm, lending the beer and good dryness and mild bitterness. Splendid upgrade.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"
2033,"2012-09-22",3.9,"Draught at Ørsted Ølbar. Opaque dark dark brown, verging on black. Great foamy beige head. Hoppy nose with some molasses, roast, cocoa and grapefruit. Taste follows the aroma, with smooth coffee setting in alongside licorice notes. Medium sweet, dry, roasted heavy bitter finish. Very very OK.

2033,"2012-09-18",3.4,"On tap. Pours a hazy dark brown with a creamy beige head. Roasty and nutty aroma, quite fat. Rich body with a fairly good roast character but never burned. A distinct hopping if never particularly aromatic - leading to a bitter finish. Actually I dont really pick up any coffee, and to be honest thats fine with me. 180912","Frederiksberg, DENMARK","Papsoe"
