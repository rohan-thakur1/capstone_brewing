1706,"2016-10-30",3.6,"Deep golden with a white head. Aroma is mostly malt and wheat and banana. Medium bodied. Clove joins the fray in the flavor. Finish has a lingering clove burn. Not a huge wheat fan but this was a nice change of pace.","Kitsap, Washington, USA","Capa"
1706,"2016-10-15",3.9,"(Bouteille provenant de Bottlecraft): Dans lordre dimportance: Clou de girofle, cannelle, banane, gingembre, miel et une moyenne acidité contrebalancée par un sucre franc. Tout ça sur un pain douillet. Excellent.","San Diego, California, USA","Marheb"
1706,"2016-10-02",3.4,"Bottle: &nbsp Orangish, faint haze, a little sediment, little head and lacing. &nbsp Soft banana and clove on the nose. &nbsp Smells fairly German. &nbsp On the tongue its a bit more subtle albeit its there. &nbsp Wheaty, a little mealy, but the spices come across on the nose moreso on the tongue. &nbsp Otherwise fairly clean. &nbsp Moderate body and mouthfeel. &nbsp Soft sweet wheaty finish with very faint banana and clove. &nbsp Very soft German Hefeweizen example.","Hardened Liver, Washington, USA","5000"
1706,"2016-09-25",3.2,"Bottle (bottled on 8/23/16). Nice to see Heater Allen locally distributed. Pours with a hazy golden orange hued body and a smallish white head that has good retention and decent lace. A bit darker than expected. Aromas are spicy/phenolic with plenty of 4VG clove notes. Doughy, bready malt aromas, mild isoamyl acetate (which is ok by me). Some slightly sweet notes. Flavors are malt forward. Bready wheat like notes. Yeast character leans phenolic (clove) with some backing banana esters. Balance is towards the malt. Mild black olive note as well. Medium bodied. Medium to medium low carbonation (~2.3vol if I had to guess - it doesnt really break out on my tongue like I was expecting) - really lacking here as it makes the body feel a bit flabby and oppressive for a beer that is suppose to be light, lively and crisp. Otherwise a solid beer with spot on fermentation notes. The body and flavors are muted and let down by the lower carbonation levels.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"
1706,"2015-08-29",3.4,"Refrigerated brown bomber, May 4, 2015 poured into a weizen glass. Cloudy orange with small white head.

1706,"2014-11-03",3.6,"Bottle shared by Marcus. Poured orange gold with a white head. Aroma of stone fruit. Then goes banana. Near med body. Flavor is mild banana and mild clove, but something stone fruit as well. Drinks well. Much tastier than many wheats.","Woodland, California, USA","bhensonb"
1706,"2014-11-03",3.6,"Bottle from Berkeley Bowl West. Pours dark golden with a modest off-white head and a floral aroma. There is a hearty fruit and wheat flavor with a fair amount of spice.","Sacramento, California, USA","marcus"
1706,"2014-08-23",3.6,"Bottle thanks to joenugs. Pour is very dark orange, almost red. Medium white head. Light banana nose. Some pear. Taste is light caramel then shows off some traditional hefe character. Definitely ester focused which I prefer. Minimal clove but its there and in check. I hate clove bombs. A tad sweet but otherwise very good. After seeing how dark this poured I wanted to hate it but its really good.","Melboring, Florida, USA","Homer321"
1706,"2014-08-20",3.8,"22 oz. bottle that was purchased in San Fran and consumed in my hotel room. I didnt have a glass so I drank about 14 oz. right out of the bottle. Not the perfect condition by any means but... The flavor was rather good.
Banana bread with spices upfront. Nice yeasty body with some cereal grain. The body is medium with a nice carbonation level. The finish is crisp and displays a lot of yeast phenol quality. Wish I could have had this in a glass because right from the bottle it was on of the best American made Hefes I have sampled in a long time. Nicely made.","Epping, New Hampshire, USA","AirForceHops"
1706,"2014-08-18",4.0,"The beer is a hazy light to medium amber, sorta orange. Bright highlights, glowy. Relatively small head for the style. The aroma is clean bready sweetness. Some banana, light spice. Definite wheat. Really nice grain flavor. Taste similarly brings a lot of precise and fresh doughy sweetness. Just a perfect level. A bit more spice. Light bitterness in the finish. My only complaint, and this is kinda hard to explain, is that its almost too perfect, too clean. The beer doesnt quite have the depth and richness of the top German examples. That said, I still think the beer is excellent. Its refreshing and incredibly easy to drink. The wheaty, malty sweetness is bright and inviting. Mouthfeel is full. The beer packs a ton of flavor for the abv. Heater Allen continues to impress. Thrilled that these guys are sending bottles out.","San Francisco, California, USA","popery"
1706,"2014-07-26",3.7,"Thanks to Prufrockstar for the trade. I remember when I was first getting into beer, back maybe 15 years or so ago, I like wheat beers. As time moved on, though, wheat beers became wheat ales, and suddenly wheat beers had to have a bunch of hops, or fruit, or spice (with some hits and a lot of misses), and fresh well-made hefeweizens became harder to find. Soooo, that said, I really enjoyed this beer...","Knoxville, Tennessee, USA","Suttree"
1706,"2014-07-17",3.9,"22 oz. bottle dated 6/2/14. It pours a lightly hazy golden color with a white head. The aroma has some mild toasted grains, subtle hints of clove, cinnamon, nutmeg and banana. Maybe a hint of powdery baseball card gum, but very subdued. It definitely smells like theres some banana bread in the oven. The flavor is similarly toasty with more baking spices, hints of banana and gum, crisp wheat character and a firm floral bitterness in the finish. Perfect carbonation. This was super enjoyable. If more Hefeweizens were like this, I would drink them much more often.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"
1706,"2014-07-17",3.0,"Bomber, thanks to Ryan. Surprisingly dark amber, clear pour without much head. Aroma of banana, cloves, cereal, cherry, and plastic pool toys. Moderately sweet throughout. Medium body, average carbonation, slick texture. Overall: I have another bottle Im going to try of this, because this feels uncharacteristically off to me. If the second bottle is markedly different, Ill wipe this rating out in favor of the new one.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
1706,"2014-07-07",3.8,"On tap at Horse Brass Pub in Portland. Pour is slightly hazy golden in appearance with a small white head and good lacing. Big bubblegum, clove, light banana, citrusy, doughy, biscuity, and floral aroma. Taste is bubblegum, banana esters, phenols, waxy, coriander, basil, and white pepper with a lightly spicy finish. Full mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Tasty hefe.","Denver, Colorado, USA","Steve_0"
1706,"2014-07-07",3.9,"At horse brass pub with Taglor Stephen and Dina. Aroma is clean wheat, air. Taste is super drinkable hefe, light wheat, malt is present but soft. The beer is just like Stephens mom; super poundable.","Dallas, Texas, USA","Experiment_Ale"

1706,"2013-07-15",3.1,"Bottle @ home, very generously shared by 3fourths. Been wanting to try this one for ages. Apparently this is an Amber Weizen. This entry currently states that its an Autumn Seasonal and the description states it is available in late May but theres no born on date to confirm this. Pours a cloudy, bright orange appearance with a thin, off white head. Very spicy- big nutmeg, big clove- caramel, burnt banana, a bit peppery aroma. Again, incredibly spicy flavor and fairly effervescent. Caramel, burnt malty, a touch watery, banana, nutmeg, light cinnamon, citrusy, strangely a touch smoky flavor. Really not like the kind of German Hefeweizen that I typically enjoy. Ok.","Fort Collins, Colorado, USA","adnielsen"
1706,"2013-03-07",3.7,"In short: A full bodied round wheat lager with a tiny bit of a smoky twist.  Very good.
How: Bottle 22oz.  Consumed relatively fresh a few weeks after purchase.  Bottle forwarded to me by mcberko, thanks a lot Matt
The look: Cloudy dark amber body topped by a off-whitebeige head with low retention
In long: Nose is banana cake, light spicy notes (cinnamon, cloves) and some pleasant smoky notes.  Body is full but the carbonation is rather low, soft bubbles here and there.  Taste has wet hay, sun dried hay, soggy banana cake, freshly baked apple pie, spicy notes (cinnamon, cloves), browned banana peels, dried yellowed grass.  Overall a very good lager, but to me very good is disappointing from Heater Allen with their Pils and Costal being so excellent.  Im not sure my bottle was supposed to have such a low carbonation, will be worth trying again to see.  This is my 5400th rating, thats quite a lot, fortunately Im not afraid my wife finds out about my ratebeer account and realizes how much time and money I spend on beer, if you ever see that I entered a rating that says ""www.google.com"", thats my wife trying to use the internet, leave her alone.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
1706,"2013-01-25",3.6,"Bottle from Corvallis. Pours a lightly hazed orange-gold with a white head. Nose is cloves, light banana and faint citrus. Clean. On tasting, light tartness, grainy wheat malt and banana esters. Some light cloves. Overall, perhaps a bit too light bodied to compete with the classics. Still, very drinkable and tasty.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","NobleSquirrel"
1706,"2013-01-18",3.6,"22 oz bottle.  Foggy orange yellow with white froth.  Nose is fresh dough, lemon peel, parsley and sugar cookie.  Wheaty but not pasty with crisp carb and a juicy finish.  Taste is lime, wheat and green banana with a touch of herbs, maybe marjoram.  Very nice as it warms.","Media, Pennsylvania, USA","TheEpeeist"
1706,"2013-01-07",3.8,"Hazy golden orange pour with a white head. Excellent wheat, banana, and clove aromas. A hint of bubblegum, light citrus and acidity, some floral notes, and a pleasant sweetness. The flavor has a nice wheat bread character to it, excellent malt sweetness, banana, and moderate clove. Good citrus character, light floral hops, and a good yeasty flavor. Really a nice beer.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"
1706,"2012-11-21",2.7,"22 oz. bottle, pours a cloudy dark golden orange with a small white head. Aroma of bananas, wheat and clove - pretty standard, but very pleasant. Flavour is fairly subtle, with lots of wheat, a little banana and clove, and more wheat. Kind of watery, mostly characterized by the wheat. I dont get the ratings on this, as its quite subpar for a hef - fairly weak with lots of missing body. First time Ive been disappointed by this brewery.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
1706,"2012-09-05",3.4,"Bottle served in a weiss glass. Hazy dark orange with a medium-size white head. Good retention and decent lace. Bright aroma of cloves, banana, and sweet, mealy malt. Light-med sweet malty flavor. Also a hint of salt and tartness. Medium body, light-creamy texture, average carbonation, and a near crisp finish. Another nice effort from this fabulous nano brewery.","Portland, Oregon, USA","cmonster"
1706,"2012-08-21",3.4,"650ml bomber pours a cloudy light orange color with a finger of white head that settles quite quickly leaving a few spots of lacing on the glass.  Aroma is banana and cloves with some light citrus and earthy tones.  Taste is light fruit sweetness with the clove spice and a light sourness from the citrus likely lemon.  Light to medium bodied with some lively carbonation.  A pretty good representation of the style.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","reebtogi"
1706,"2012-03-27",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 9, 2012 Cloudy bronze pour with an ample sand colored head.  Classic nose of banana, cinnamon, and clove; but there is also a pie-like apple and pear character that marries very well with the toasty, crusty wheat malt.  The yeast sings here, and lends a very nice rustic quality to the lightly sweet flavor.  Carbonation is smooth and creamy.  Medium bodied, a bit slick, with extremely low bitterness in the finish.  Really nice, classic hefe here.  The strong, silent type.  Standing solid and unassuming in the background, watching over some of its higher-rated American brothers as they dance around in their imperialized costumes.","Wilderness, WA, USA, ","brewolf"
1706,"2012-03-17",4.1,"Bottle from brewolf...thanks Michael! - Poured the entire bomber into a 500ml Aventinus glass. Its cloudy copper with a big foamy off-white head. Nose is pear, banana, the syrup they put in canned peaches, and a light spicy clove. Num. Taste is classic hefe--big banana notes, bold wheat, and a sweet yeastiness that mingles with some spicy clove. Dries out a bit on the finish with a mineral quality, then comes back strong with a sweet fruity long finish and a rustic grain note. Big and fluffy body with ample carbonation and a touch of slickness. Everything Ive had from this brewery had been phenomenal, and this is no exception. Thanks to Michael for turning me on to them!","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
1706,"2011-11-03",3.8,"UPDATED: JUL 16, 2013 multiple bottles.  cloudy chestnut brown with a beige head.  strong fruity / waxy esters in the nose: banana and clove, sure, but also some fruit cocktail / pear notes, light toast / biscuit pale malt and semi-sweet cream / yogurt yeast.  exceptionally smooth, silky and creamy; medium bodied; low bitterness, medium-low acid; hefty and round and quaffable without feeling too big for its sweetness.  might could say it approaches dunkelweizen territory. Edit: 2013 bottles are mushroom-y and strangely watery.  Probably a 3.4-3.6 for me.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
