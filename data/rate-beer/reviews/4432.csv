4432,"2017-06-22",4.5,"A 750ml bottle, bottled on 14th November 2016. Poured into a wine glass. It was a very nice lightly cloudy ruby red colour with a two finger pinkish head that dissipated fairly quickly to a settled thin layer with only sparse lacing. Aromas of lots of tart red berries, raspberry and strawberry plus grapes and lemon. Nice barrel and oak character with a hint of red wine vinegar and only light funk and barnyard-iness. Tastes moderately sour, cherry, raspberry, strawberry, grape juice and oak with hints of grapefruit and funk. Dry, light to medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation. Overall with less than a year since bottling, there was lots of really nice fruit flavours bursting out while the funk was quite light. Although this particular bottle was quite young, it also taste great with age. Cant wait to try more of this wonderful goodness.","Hong Kong, HONG KONG","davidezdonz"

4432,"2016-09-17",4.1,"750 mL bottle. Bottle dated 11/21/2010, I believe. Tough to read as its smudged. Originally reviewed 7/26/2012.
Murky/hazy pinkish purple. Not quite a burgundy. The head is gone before I even get a chance to look at it.
Acidic and musty grape smell. The fruit isnt a bright aroma, but rather a general aura of grape surrounding the lemongrass and other lambic aromas.

Sour, but not overly so. The grape flavor again isnt bright, but more of a background flavor cutting some of the acidity. Oak and tannins dry it out in the finish, but theres a deep musty character in the finish that comes across as a deep barnyard funk.

Heavyish, even though it really isnt. Lower carbonation. Drinks like a wine.

Not the most amazing fruit flavor Ive had in a lambic, but it certainly doesnt detract from the beer. I feel as though the Cantillon lambic profile calls for lighter fruits, a la Fou Foune.","Florida, USA","ctipping"

4432,"2016-07-23",4.4,"Meget smuk rødblå og ufiltreret Lambic Style / Fruit med minimal skumtop og kun kant samt overflade. Rolig. 
Dette brygs aroma er præget af en vinøs surhed henad rosévin og vindruer. Plus røde bær bl.a. kirsebær og hindbær. 
Smagen er sur og syrlig, men på en meget elegant og lidt stille måde og noter af træfadlagringen er tydeligt til stede. Vedhæftet en lille bitterhed og ligeså lille sødme. 
Munden snører sig sammen og mængden af mundvand øges - så ved man, at man er i Sour-land. Fint lidt afdæmpet karbonering og middel fyldig krop. En vis blød mundfølelse, olieret konsistens og en afbalanceret sur afslutning. 
Overall: Elegant frugt-Lambic og Cantillon lever op til sit rygte. Druer og fadlagring giver dette bryg et særkende, og blandt surøl er dette verdensklasse.

Kolor mętny i ciemno czerwony, piana jest różowa, ale szybko znika. Typowe dla lambika.

The nose shows a lot of malt with bretty funk and very subtle notes of dark fruit typical of red wine - think plums, boysenberries, and cassis.

Cloudy brownish red with an off-white head. Aroma is funky with leather, barnyard and cellar notes, tart, light sweet and deep fruity notes. Taste is soft tart, vinous and funky.

2014 has a much more vibrant fruity note whereas the 2007 is more funky with some cellar, leather and wet wood notes. Also less tart, more complex and rounded mouthfeel than 2007, which is no surprise considering the aging. Both are great but prefer the older one.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","hackobock"

O: Very drinkable beer. Just another amazing Cantillon...

This product is made in very limited quantities and not easy to find on the Belgian market. It is a ravishing purple red beauty with lilac foam and champenoise sparkles, very complex, extremely fruity, lovely funkiness, and one of the most elegant lambics I ever tasted, though I do prefer the white grape version called Vigneronne over this (but only very slightly so).","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Has a beautiful, vibrant color of red grapes, revealing a ruby note, and a fizzy, soon vanishing head.

Has aromas of a distinct leathery funkiness, paired with ripe grapes, pulling out their stone qualities in the best way, due to the supportive, wooden barrel. The funky barnyard tartness blends extremely well into the fermented, vinous, sour grapes. The fruitiness, as well as the wooden oakiness illustrate the acidic tartness in a very intriguing way, evoking the feeling of this being more wine than beer. 

Begins with prickly, unripe grapes among earthy, leathery malts. The grapes turn sweeter, riper as the malts stand out against the tart sourness, adding stone fruit qualities to the taste. At the same time, carried by a lively carbonation, the sourness becomes quite intense, with a vinegar note, evoked by the fermented grape sourness, while both tastes blend well together, wrapped up by the wooden barrel. Finishes with a tongue quenching, slightly dry sourness, along with lemon zest and grape pulp. The beer still reminds me in many ways of a young wine, while missing its typical sweetness, replaced by the typical lambic tartness, with a refreshing, high carbonation.","GERMANY","aleigator"

A: pours a beautiful deep rose read with a finger of transient pink foam and brilliant clarity. No lace. Beautiful beer. Normally, some of the characteristics here would take away, but this appearance is simply stunning. Great looking beer.
S: Mmmmm. Spicy blend of yeast, dry sour, farm funk (the most Ive smelled in a cantillon), lots of lacto. Nice.
T: Dry, puckering, tart and fruity. The fruit tone is really surprising provided the time in bottle. Plenty of signature Cantillon sour puckering flavors. Hints of white vinegar. Really nice.
M: Thin, moderately low carbonation allows for the tannic dryness in the beer to shine. Make me water and want more.
O: I really, really enjoyed this beer, but I think I might prefer some of the others from the crew there in Brussels to this one.

Considering how cheap this is at the brewery I wish I would have been able to bring back more. A phenomenal release is among not only the best lambics in the world but the best (so far) from Cantillon. I am glad I have at least one more to drink at some point in the future because it should keep for a very long time.

Aroma / Appearance - The carbonated cherry base is trapped by a stark white head. Sweet bing cherries, white wine, and a playful tartness sting the air. This is not overly acidic or vinegary but is perfect even relatively fresh.

Flavor / Palate - Vinegar and sea salt chips mix with a generous scoop of cherries and raspberries. Fruity and tart, it is not intense. That makes it disappear almost immediately until the bottle is down to the dregs.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

Pours dark reddish with a light purple hue. An off-white head fizzes up on a semi-aggressive pour and quickly slows down until a thin layer of white bubbles remain on top.

A nice tart/sour funk mixed in with some dark fruity notes. A nice blend of the awesome funkyness, some oak backbone, and fruity sweetness. Not quite as sour as I was expecting, but the sweet grape notes really make up for that. I am digging this. Light bodied and fizzy carbonation reminds me of a gentle champagne.

Fizzy purple body is dark and ominous, supporting a thin layer of protective off-white head. Acetic fruits and bright, spritzy yeast dance among my nostrils. The marriage between soured grapes and oaky red wine barrels is perfect. Finishes clean and dry with just the right amount of puckering tartness.

We opened an 06 alongside this fresh pour and were surprised how vastly different the two were. This metamorphosis is unlike any other aged Cantillon Ive tried: the other fruit lambics still typically retain some fruity characteristics as they age, but the grapes are totally gone in this bottle of Lamvinus. Its instead transformed into a cheesy, super funky, gueuze-like lambic with grassy, farmyard funk and high acidity. The color has even faded to a more amber color compared to the deep purple of the original.

Both are absolutely delicious; still hard to believe how wildly different they are.","Dallas, Texas, USA","brystmar"

4432,"2012-10-17",4.1,"July 24th, 2010 - The Cantillon Saint Lamvinus was not my first Cantillon, but like my first, it was an incredible beverage, memorable both for its symbolism, rarity and above all, the brew itself. Out in Colorado Cantillon is a rare beast, and one has to go on safari to track and hunt it. Fortunately, I know where one of the fine hunting spots is (Liquor Max in Loveland), and my parents always deign to give me a few moments in the store on the way to my birthday weekend in September up to the Estes Park Irish & Celtic Music Festival. Rather than purchase a broad smattering of beers, I concentrated my budget and splurged on a few beers whose names are whispered with reverence on the beer forums, including this Saint Lamvinus. And drinking it in July, I am surely toasting the summer zenith, but also the end of a wonderful 2 year stint in Seattle. It was a fitting beer for the occasion - a mouth puckering salute to genuine Belgian lambics, and an adumbration of the tumultuous years to come. A beautiful dark pomegranate and overripe raspberry color, I dont think Ive ever seen  beer take on quite this color - a shade of purple found in Monets take on the lily, accented by a 1cm roseate head. Its a gorgeous brew, with a delicate aroma. Raspberries and wet cherries form the bulk of the bouquet, with a touch of  a light, fruity sweetness of watermelon, giving this aroma an extra welcome touch on a July evening. The aromas chicanery is soon revealed, when the flavor reveals that hardcore, hard-nosed, traditional limbic sourness. My lips curl in, cratering around my teeth, and my eyes begin to water as the oak aging takes its toll on the inside of my mouth. Withered, dehydrated berry flavors join in the fray, flavoring this beer as if it were a carbonated fruit vinegar. As the flavor progresses the intensity rises until it is a loud chirping of berry fruits and a peal of oak and acidity. Not for the faint of heart, the Saint Lamvinus is a beautiful ode to the style, and a reminder of the orthodox Lambic style - unforgiving, stern, but rewarding when imbibed with patience and diligence.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

4432,"2012-10-06",4.7,"750 bottle to flute glass...

Aroma: Similar to Cantillon fruit lambic but more winey, no doubt because of the grapes. More sweet aromas than the aforementioned and less latexy...quite floral with notes of grape, blackcurrant, cherry, and some grapefruit. 

Appearance: Cloudy dark reddy color, the head left quickly and was pinkish white.

Taste: Quite like a merlot wine, and very complex too with lots of fruit and citrus flavours. Aftertaste is definitely grapes and classic lambic flavours.

Palate: Spritzy and dry, slight sour aftertaste and slightly tannic. Quite good.

Overall: Probably my favorite lambic of the ones Ive tried though Im not a fan of the price tag. Perfect balance of sweet and sour with lots of character.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","RD400F"

4432,"2012-09-07",4.1,"750 ml Bottle, Vintage 2011 on cork. BIG thanks to Adam Jackson for this brew! Used a tall pilsner glass. Delightful Purple wine color with steady carbonation. Head produced by carbonation is reminiscent of champagne. Nose is sour fruit. Mostly grape and raspberry. Notes of funky oak. Taste is a sour blend of the nose with a major puckering effect. The oak flavor comes through like the scent of old wood saturated from a rain storm. The first taste made me salivate so hard, there was pain in my salivary glands: like when biting in to an unripened, fresh, green apple. The carbonation leaves a prickliness on my tongue which was quickly replaced by the very drying, cotton-mouth finish.

Around them a whirlwind of earthy, organic scents can barely be contained by the glass. Its the usual Cantillon experience on the tongue, except the years have stolen some carbonation.

A - Poured with half a finger solid white head that faded fast to nothing. Looks very soft and still in the glass. Burgundy purple/red appearance, murky and very ""raw"" in appearance. 

S - I get the scent from 2 feet away. Up front tart and funky scent. Lots of weird characteristics that were unexpected. Sort of rubbery and heavy birch wood scent. Hints of berries and rotten grapes. 

T - Wow. This is delicious. Of course, theres this funky tart bitter-sweet taste up front. its followed by this astringent grape skin sort of tannins dryness. Hint of very standard grocery store grape fruit juice taste. Hint of lemon juice and this heavy oak / birch finish. Worth mentioning too that its less fruity than expected and slightly too much acidity and I wasnt expecting that much from a Cantillon. 

M - 40% carbonation on my mouth swish. Medium body (surprising for a Fruit Lambic) and a puckering dry finish.

The beer pours a deep purple color with a small head that fades fairly quickly. 

The aroma is very funky, barnyardy, with some light citrus rind, and fruit forward notes like bright grapes. 

The beer is very dry in flavor and is also very sour, not unlike gueuze in this regard but certainly different. The light fruit and leathery tannic character of the grapes is skillfully matched & balanced with the character of the Lambic. In fact the grapiness starts with a touch of sweetness that passes very quickly allowing for the tartness and dryness of the beer to take center stage. The grape character and the funky sour lambic really interweave and at times lean on each other to become something truly greater than the sum of their parts. Making a rich, bold beer that is at times subtle, and elegant all around.

Dec. 2008 vintage.

A: Bright purple color with a slight haze. There is but a wee head that fades quickly, leaving no lacing.

S: A noticeably different aroma than the draft serving. I detected more of Cantillons distinct, funky barnyard scent in the bottled version. Aromas also consist of berries, grapes, oak.

T: Though the serving type altered some of the characteristics of this beer slightly, this is a world class fruit lambic nonetheless. Fabulous grape flavors, though more subtle than the draft version, wrapped in a sour farm blanket make for a truly delicious beverage. There is a nice tannic presence to the beer, as well. This is extremely well-crafted, with a myriad of flavors coming through. Balanced to perfection, I give this beer my highest recommendation.

Initial taste is a light acidity with a lot of oak and fruity red wine.  The finish is really musty with some funk mixed with the oak barrel.  Maybe some sugary sweetness underneath the sourness.

Theres just the right amount of acetic acid for added sharpness without being noticeable. This is really a good example of how a fruit lambic should be done.

4432,"2012-03-05",3.9,"From notes.  First reviewed 3/18/2011.  Served on tap at Local Option in a snifter.

The base color of this beer is a hazy cherry color, with tints ranging from bright orange to walnut depending on the light. A very interesting appearance is capped with an light pinkish head. The retention is not amazing, but a ring around the beer sticks around for a while.

There is a fair amount of acidity in the aroma, tart grapes, vinegar, and some nice funk.

A full red grape flavor right from the start. The flavor is predictably tart, with an acidic vinegar roaming throughout. Some barnyard funk is present, although fairly modest. The sour flavor lingers after each sip.

Medium body, with crisp carbonation up front. The feel smooths out toward the end. Definitely causes the salivary glands to go into overdrive and creates a moderate puckering sensation, although this falls into the average range of sourness.

Overall: I have been waiting to try this beer for a while now, and it did not disappoint. Due to the grapes, it has an obvious wine-like character, which is enjoyable. Whether it is worth the price tag, however, is debatable.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

There is a reaso that Cantillon suggests you drink the fruit lambics within three years and that is to maximize on the fruit.  However, I love the funk so I am fine with letting the fruit go.  The nose has cheese, dirt and leather.  The flavor runs you through the gambit, starts sweet and maintains a degree of sweetness throughout, while saltiness and bitter hit you in the middle followed by a grandios sour exit that leaves you puckers for a bit.

4432,"2011-12-26",4.1,"750 ml from Brewery Creek. What a rich lipstick color, like homemade raspberry jam. Small pink beige head. This color is seductive. The aroma is pungently poopy, and at first several sips the diaper is overwhelming other nice stuff. Penetrating beneath the poop, I first find cheese rinds. So it doesnt look good so far. I have to patiently search for the nice lambic character, the dried cranberry and the nutty malts. The resin, and retsina. As it sits, the dark wine-infested infected old wood character emerges more. Its certainly compelling enough to drink a lot of. The palate is nice, and its all up hill from there. Soft and gentle with a high degree of acidity. Lively carbonation but soft on the mouth. The finish is for me good, lots of straightforward dryness and acidity. Its a very astringent beer. Very little fruit character but does have a nice lingering pure cereal aftertaste. Lots of resin and turpentine in the finish too. Although I was expecting more (its amazing how a 4.1 is a low score for a Cantillion), this is still highly drinkable, offering an opportunity to contemplate the assault on the senses, and hitting the lambic g-spot.","VANCOUVER, British Columbia, CANADA","Beershine"

Leather, barnyard, smells like bark from an old tree, musty oak, sweet notes of dark grapes, dried grape fruit peel, and I even get hints of figs which I would never expect from a lambic. Pouring a bit more and swirling it, I immediately get tart notes of peel from unripe white grapes and gooseberries along with mature cheese. As it warms, notes of pinot noir spicy fruitiness comes along and a more pronounced wine barrel character. Taste starts off with a tart grape notes, followed by a sweetness, a bit like an english wine gum. Then classic gueuze qualities with all the yeast notes and classic Cantillon funk goodness and a slightly vineous oak component. Tart gooseberries, but theres a very delicate grape component that rounds the palate off very well, that together with the tartness makes a wine gum-like finish.

Doft: Funky... oh yes, sur likaså... omedelbart gör den till känna att den inte är en liten parvel som sin yngre kusin. I denna finns det mer kraft, helt klart. Ek, torkad frukt och mjölksyra blandar sig i doften tillsammans med funken. Den luktar verkligen helt fantastiskt.

Smak och munkänsla: Oj, här blev jag förvånad. Jag förberedde mig på en käftsmäll i form av syra, men istället möttes jag av en väldigt välbalanserad smak där den extrema syran balanserades upp nästan helt och hållet av en intensiv, söt smak av kanderad frukt och russin. Rent spontant (höhö... no pun intended) känns den mer som en flamländsk röd än en druvlambic! När man dessutom smakade ölen tillsammans med ett hallon så framhävdes sötman helt galet mycket och lät smaken av torkad och kanderad frukt bara lysa igenom. Asgott!

Utseende: Inte bara smakade den likt en flamländs röd utan såg också ut som en. Mörkröd, nästintill brun, färg med ett cremevitt skum. Såg relativt ful ut i jämförelse med glaset blåbær men ack så inbjudande.","Copenhagen, DENMARK","Pundarquartis"

3.5 A: Lightly hazed plum color. Just about two fingers of barely pink soda pop head that falls quickly and leaves no lacing.

4.5 S: Already I know Im in for a much better experience. Tons of vinous grape with blueberry and blackberry just behind and perhaps a touch of cherry to round things out. Lots of musty funkiness with barnyard notes as well. Small oak contribution. Good balance between fruit and acid. Good bit of fruity lactic acid with just a hint of acetic acid. Very nice.

4.5 T: A good bit of sourness in this, but the acetic acid isnt overabundant. Again lots of grape with nearly as much cherry. The berry twins have taken a bit of a backseat in the taste. Plenty of barnyard and musty funk. This is loaded with tangy lactic acid. Complex and well balanced.

4.0 M: Lighter medium body. Good active carbonation. Lightly creamy and smooth.

4.5 D: Good beer. Definitely sour, but not intestine twisting. After the Kriek yesterday I had a few rounds of the quick step, but I dont imagine there will be an encore performance tonight. Solid all around.

4432,"2011-07-30",4.5,"750 ml bottled in 2010 shared by cenzo.  Thanks Vince.  Pours a bright cherry red with small white head that has decent retention and leaves a bit of lacing on the glass.  The aroma is a light brett funkiness, red wine grapes, light tannins with a bit of oak as well as a bit of cherry.  The initial taste is quite sour with a little bit of sweetness and the red wine grapes coming through.  A bit of oak and cherry are present as well as some lactic acid.  The standard Cantillon barnyard funk is present in small amounts as well.  The finish has a light tannic astringency.  Light to medium body with a really good slick mouthfeel.

4432,"2011-07-26",3.9,"750 ml capped and corked bottle purchased at Royal in Kansas City, Missouri.  Bottled on 21 November 2010.  Opens with a soft pop. Pour is a slight haze ruby pink with a one inch pinkish off white head, which falls noisily. Aroma is red wine tannins, general red grape, grape skins and a nice barnyard leathery Brett.  The Cantillon citrus sour is present as well, though certainly behind the wine.  Secondary is the oak, contributing more of the tannin. The taste is the round Merlot grape, full of tannins, very earthy along with drying leathery Brett and a nice clean dose of the Cantillon lemon citrus sourness. As the beer warms to room temp, it really takes on the feel of a Brett infused red wine. Palate is medium to light bodied, active spritzy carbonation and the sour dry finish. The oak and red wine carry the longish finish.  This was a very unique beer, well executed and certainly worthy of the splurge. With age on this, it must be bone dry.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

Aroma is sour, citric with a hint of acetic, perhaps a little lactic in there as well. There is a slight sulfur aroma to it.

Minimal front flavor, beer is light in body. Drinkability high. The tartness gets you, its grapey and slightly sweet but in a sour and sweet sort of way. The flavors develop better on the back palate than the front. Its a great beer. There is not a lot of body to it and there is nearly no carbonation in the mouth. I really enjoyed it.

Very tart. 

Taste like they took cheap champagne like a Pol Clement and poured it over pureed ripe strawberries so you have the essence of a sparkling wine. You dont get strawberries from merlot usually. A rose of merlot in beer form. Enjoy if thats your thing.

4432,"2010-06-13",4.6,"I have had this before on tap but this 2006 bottle was an incredible sour and worlds beyond the draft experience. I split this among three snifters. Yes you want to share this one. It had a light white bubbly head that disappeared fast and left a thin ring of bubbles around the glass. The color of the beer was a beautiful reddish peach in color. I expect this was from the age because my tap pour was much more burgundy. There was definite signs of barrel ageing to the appearance as well

The aroma was that incredible unmistakable Cantillon funk. The first time you smell it you will never forget it. To say this brew was sour would be understating yourself . This is one of those sour patch kid type brews but with out any sugar to balance it . I had this while smoking a fine cigar and the flavor just cut and cleansed the mouth at every sip. It was not to say so sour that it came off a vinegar but it was more like eating a hand full of sour grapes or a tart piece of fruit. The carbonation and the mouthfeel reminded me of a fine champagne.

This is a great brew I loved it but I do think it takes time to appreciate a sour and the age of the bottle greatly changed the flavors from the glass that I had fresh also at $35.00 a bottle its not cheep. It was a great experience and one I will love to have again but not something I expect every day. Another hint is you have to split this bottle with someone who will appreciate it.

The true vinous character comes out, sharp tart cherries, sour grapes, very strong wood character amongst other dark fruits. The balance of the wood, earthy malts and sharp tartness is in perfect harmony. Medium body and a soft carbonation. An amazing beer, exact balance and the perfect meld of the wine and beer cultures.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","FunkyBrewster"

4432,"2010-02-05",4.7,"Opaque red, thin pink head that goes away quick. Nose is full on brett, but the grape brings a juicy note in the back that edges off the strong barn and sweat elements, putting it right on the edge of great before going overboard. The flavor is a fruit blast, with grape, strawberry, and lemon as forefront for the dusty brett and leather hints in the back. As it warms, a malt/lactic sweetness emerges on the mid-palate that reminds of milk chocolate, yet the flavor does not break from the previous harmony.  Weight and carbonation are 100% spot on, finish is long in sweet fruit at the front and drying lemon at the back. This is crafted beyond measure, the fruit-brett marriage perfectly in tune throughout the experience. Is ""Best Cantillon beer Ive tried"" too little or too much of a compliment?","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","MrChopin"

4432,"2010-01-11",4.0,"The color is reminiscent of the pulp in a red grapefruit. Hazy. Slightly off-white minimal head that settles into a nice little ring of lacings. Very good aesthetic qualities.

Pleasant qualities of red wine with tart fruity aromas (grapes). Beneath, the Cantillon signature smell lurks - Wet hay, matured cheese and yeast, rather funky. A delightful and edgy smell.

Plenty of tart fruit flavors with a prominent but subtle character of grapes. Noticeable taste of fruit pits. A light sweetness balances the tartness and the acidity that is gaining momentum. Not very funky, but theres definitely a taste of hay. In general, the taste have some similarities with a tart fruity sparkling wine. Subtle note of wheat, basically no barley. The finish is sour with notes of grass, earth, nuts and fruits.

Light body, very tingling in the mouth due to a lively carbonation. The finish is slightly dry. Excellent.

A fantastic lambic, a real work of art. The character of a sparkling wine this one showcases is fantastic.

4432,"2009-06-30",3.8,"750ml bottle. Bottled in 2007. Served in a Smokestack chalice (v2) a little colder than needed. Gentle aroma, at first, possibly due to the temperature of the beer. What I can coax out of it is slight funky brett, a little wood, some acidity and a berry like fruitiness, akin to black raspberries. Reddish purple color with a smallish offwhite/pink head. The fruitflies seem to appreciate the aroma and or flavor since I just picked one out of my glass. The intial taste is somewhat tart, with under ripe berries, vanilla and some subtle barnyard characteristics, followed by a rush of acid, with the acetic aspect more noticeable, and some nice berry and general fruity flavors. There is more ethyl acetate (fingernail polish remover) than I would care for, but it is not over the top. Im not sure that I could distinguish the fruit in the beer as being wine grapes, but I do get a nice berry flavor throughout and lingering into the finish. Once again, this is a Cantillon beer that I do not find overly sour, yet I am not sure if it is the beer or me, probably the latter. The beer seems to come into more of its own after warming up, there is more rich fruit flavors counterbalanced by a nice sourness that feels more lactic than acetic, inasmuch as it is more gentle for the amount of sourness presented than it would be if it was all or mostly acetic. The second glass seems to be a little more of most everything; more fruit, more tartness, more wood (still subtle), but less barnyard. This is a well made, imaginative beer, but it comes at such a steep premium that I doubt I will ever try it again and I am fine with that.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Medium bodied and bit dry palate with medium carbonation. Berries, grapes, sourness, wood, bread and bitterness in taste. Berries and sourness in aftertaste. I prefer more sour lambics but this was nice, too.","Helsinki, FINLAND","mjs"

4432,"2009-06-07",3.9,"750ml bottle. Poured red with a pink medium head that is short lived. Aroma is barnyard, light sourness but not much fruits. Felt some tiny hints of wine as it warmed up. Taste is light sourness, dry but still not much fruits. Very drinkable and refreshing but I would have hoped for a much more fruity profile. There are small hints of cherries and grapes to be found but really discrete. Still, is is a really fine lambic that is very enjoyable and tasty. Also quite drinkable since the sourness is not too powerful. Carbonation is not very strong but full of small bubbles tickling the back of the tongue. I will have the chance to re-rate with my other bottle !!","Québec City, Quebec, CANADA","Fred82"

A bubbly white head forms and actually has decent retention, certainly some of the best I’ve seen in the style.  A thick circle of puffy white bubbles circles the glass and some swirls form patterns in the center.  Aroma is bursting with Cantillon house character, strong as ever.  Intense Gueuze-like aromas - cider and horse, intense barnyard, very musty.  Some grape and cherry-like aromas are also noted as well as a flowery, perfume character.  A lot of acidic notes are also found. A tannic oakiness is found at warmer temperatures though it is certainly not overwhelming or obvious. This is just a lovely, intensely funky nose.  Flavor is fairly intense sourness that leads to a fruity, wine drenched finish.  The tartness does not linger, it hits the tongue then transforms to fruit and the finish is dry and not at all sour.  Very fruity with an assortment of berry flavors, acidity is low-to medium. Slight oakiness and wine-like in the taste as well. The flavor lacks a little something, I don’t know what, but the aroma is better than the taste.

4432,"2008-08-02",3.8,"UPDATED: AUG 3, 2008 750, cap and cork - Oct. 26, 2006 on the bottle.  Pretty ugly looking beer - murky pureed berry color with an almost white, light pink head.  Nose is wild and sour - bready and funky.  The oak is a nice complement but I dont get anything vinous on the nose.  Mostly sour, not very subtle, but intriguing.  Flavor is better - huge sour punch up front with a rounded fruit and wine middle.  Soft for a split second and then pile-driving sourness.  Earthy and supple finish with nice mineral qualities.  Not overly pithy - its the kind of lambic that makes your mouth really water as you sip it.  Excellent tiny bubbles and silky mouthfeel, dusty finish.

4432,"2008-04-04",4.1,"Pours brightly and vibrant; kind of an electric orange-pink color.  Heavily hazed.  Huge stinky cheese, mold, and wet concrete aroma; tannic, soiled, dirty, juicy.  Cinnamon, green apple, balsamic, pears.  Definitively funky and bracingly violent.  Flavor is a crisp, sour spiciness of raw wood mingled with aged balsamic vinegar and caramelized pear skins.  Crushing.  Searing raspberry acidity and stone ground brown mustard.  Bit of stale wood chip, musty carpet and mildew, and wet grass in the mid palate; mouthfeel is generous and velvety, with a soft sparkle.  The finish is simply stunning; a furious tide of raspberry and lemon juice leaving a coating of dry, burgundy infused irish cheddar.  Acidity predominates, and doesnt dry out to much; more of a dusty, cobwebby, soft merlot tannic bitterness.  Pineapple rind.

If I was a vampire this beer would look appealing, Im not but hey it still looked quite a tasty number. Starts off with a funky red or rose? wine on the nose.

If it hadnt become significantly less bad upon sipping, I might have given the aroma a 1. Here at RateBeer, we rate on a hedonistic scale, and the aroma by no means brought me pleasure.

Flavors of crabapple, apple, lemon, and tonic water. Long, strong, tart aftertaste. Medium body. Soft in the palate. The rest of the beer more than makes up for the awful reek.

4432,"2007-10-03",3.8,"Cloudy darkish pink color on the pour with minimal white fizzy head.  Nose of vinegar slightly with fruits big on grape.  Flavor is quite sour with a great grape flavor coming through past that sourness.  I realy enjoyed this brew it just didnt rate that high on some of the levels, but overall that 17 should give an idea where it rates on my list.","Aurora, Illinois, USA","Dough77"
4432,"2007-09-29",5.0,"Off notes 4/2007. Cork reads ""bottled 2005"". 

Pours a slightly clouded ruby with a pinkish hue to it. Nose is the typical sour with slight wood attribute and a fairly firm antiseptic tone as well. I find the flavor a very smooth and traditional sour with the fruit influence. There are berries and a touch of wood on the flavor. It is extremely sour, but I still feel like it is well within acceptable limits as I am taking long swigs of this one. I cant help it. Feel is nice and thick on the liquid and slightly carbonated. Its nice and smooth going down. 

Overall this is fairly sour, as these guys always are. But I think it is extremely smooth and doesnt really carry any harsh characteristics at all. Quite easily this might be the easiest drinking lambic I have had to date. Well worth the price.

I had this on cask at Spuyten Duyvil 6/2007, and it was just as amazing.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","RblWthACoz"

Bottle-4th brew of Stone 1st Annual Sour Festival, July 22nd 2007.  Shared this cool day very mellow day with bikesandbeer, wetherel, westsidethreat, padrefan, fordest, denverlogan and many others. Ive been wanting to try this for a long time, but never quite got up the nerve to pay the $40 usually charged for this bottle.  Glad to get a taster instead.  Pours almost purpley red, plum red with a little head composed of white islands and a ring.  The nose is funky, sour, grapey and as my pal westside threat said a little bit of diaper in there, either that or the wind caught some of the mulch in the stone world bistro.  The taste is sour tart, vinous, and grapey.  Very good and interesting, but certainly not quite as good as some hype might make it out to be.  Worthwhile to have and glad Ive had it.","Portland, Oregon, USA","WeeHeavySD"
4432,"2007-07-23",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 25, 2010 (Bottle) Pours hazy red to purple. Grapey, woody and vinous aroma with fruity undertones. Medium acidity nose. Sour, acid and vinous flavour with tones of grapes, fruits and citrus. Tart and dry typical Cantillon style but more balanced, with some sweetness, compared to some other beers from the brewery. Medium body.  8/4/8/4/14 Second try: (Bottle) Pours dark cloudy orange amber with small off-white head. The aroma is super barnyardy with notes of wet wood, old oak, horse blanket, spices and damp basement. Ripe grapes, wet leather and phenols in the undertones. The brett profile is probably the most complex ever. clear notes of citric-like lacto as well. The flavour is dry and medium to heavily acidic with almost no bitterness.Brett than lacto in good harmony. Barnyard, aggressive lemon, wet leather and earth. The mouthfeel is tart/astringent with near medium carbonation. Super tart citric finish. Juicy and flavourful. Near medium bodied. I love. Probably the best Lambic ever!","Göteborg, SWEDEN","Marsiblursi"
4432,"2007-07-23",4.3,"Tasted various times over the years, including at the Stone Sour fest.  Semi cloudy cherry red color.  This is like a big tart-sour fruit soup with truly fascinating and fun tart cherry and raspberry profile.  A little barnyard, wood, mixed other tart berries but very refreshing and tasty from first sip thru the finish.  One of my favorites of this Stone sour fest and from Cantillon.","LA, California, USA","DenverLogan"

Flavor is dark tart cherries, oak, grapes, barnyard, lemon.   Palate is medium light, medium to  high carbonaton, tart, dry finish.   This is a really fantastic brew.   Tons of tartness and refreshing acidic fruit flavors make this an excellent summer brew.   That being said, its way too pricey for me, glad I got to try it, but wont be doing it again any time soon.   I think their whole line up is fantastic, so you cant go wrong at any price point.","Ohio, USA","ogglethorp"
4432,"2007-07-03",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 11, 2007 Light ruby body with a very short-lived head.  Nose is woody and funky.  Taste is dry, very dry.  Supposedly aged with grapes in oak barrels, the barrels is a lot more predominant than the grapes.  All kinds of dry woods on the tongue.  The beer is indeed fruity but the flavour is not particularly focussed on grapes.  More of a general red fruits flavour (grapes, cherries, berries, etc.).  Some acidity but nowhere near the level of their Gueuze.  In this case it is the woody dryness and not the acidity that makes it a sipper.  I prefer their more standard and cheaper products but this is truly an excellent beer with its own personality.  Its only problem is its stiff price tag.  At only 5% it could be an everyday beer, but at $20/bottle ouch!  Its not that I would mind being poor as long as it doesnt prevent me from having a lot of money.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

In the flavor, tart vinegar washed over the front of the tongue with wheat and lemon-accented dust across the middle.. hint of sweetness along with the tart, lemony-vinous finish.

Poured a reddish brown with a thin pink head. The aroma found that lambic sour fruitiness. The flavor was tart to say the least with a fruit and light citrus blend. Medium body and tart aftertaste.

If I had no clue what was being poured blinfolded and smelled this beer, Id guess Cantillon.  The taste is very acidic, but not as overpowering as the aromas would suggest.  Once you get past the sourness, some nice atringent fruits show up.  Some grapes and lemon from the acidity are definitely present.  Just another good Cantillon showing.","Jupiter, Florida, USA","mgumby10"

There is some woody oak, funk, faint grape juice.  Flavor is indeed quite sour--lemon and unripened granny smith apple-like--with some oak and funk again, and a dry finish.

4432,"2007-04-13",4.2,"Tap at Ginger Man.  Deep ruby beer, with a thin white lace.  Almost still appearance.  The aroma shows the characteristic Cantillon house character but also an intense fruity pinot noir grapiness on top.  Strong malic/lactic tartness.  The acidity, while intense, is much more restrained than in many other Cantillons Ive had.  Warming brings up loads of sweet ripe fruit, cherry, red grapes, and a touch of raspberry.  Flavour is lovely, a soft sweetness on the front shows off the grape/cherry flavour while a soft tannic astringency helps balance this on the back.  Further warming brings up notes of earthiness and funkiness that Ive come to expect from Cantillon.  Once the beer is at room temperature, the fruity aspects really dominate, with the acid serving as a bit of punch to brighten them up.  Quite a treat finding this brew on tap.  Awesome stuff.","Toronto, ON, Ontario, CANADA","JoeMcPhee"

4432,"2007-02-10",3.7,"Saint Lamvinus had long lurked in the shadows of my cellar, creeping out of its lambic corner from time to time, titillating but never convincing as I remained impervious to its charm, waiting for time work its metamorphosing dexterity. Finally on a winter eve, it was uncorked and of its bright cardinal body spewed a bubbly white foam. Cherry appeared strongly upon the nose alongside Cantillons classic sourness and a woody complexity. Sweet tonalities of white wine, brown sugar and raisin accompanied the delicate balance of vanilla and raspberry, along with a slightly cheesy note. Flowing organically onto the palate, it seemed the nose was reflected with accented sourness, red currant, white pepper and the slightest hint of grape. The rubbery and somewhat unpleasant acerbity that I often associate with Cantillon was present again, which combined with the surprisingly minimal vinous aspect felt rather underwhelming. The long sticky and fruity sour aftertaste is vaguely redeeming but I found that I would much rather a simple bottle of Cantillons Kriek than go through the trouble of acquiring and caring for such an esoteric yet uninspiring bottle.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

Typical small but long-lived Cantillon head(for an aged bottle), pink and purple with white ringlets of bubbles. Mostly translucent, slightly oily in appearance. Cantillon house aroma that seems more full bodied than usual. Strong musty grape aroma with a tannic flash and a bit of cedar. Reminds me of the Italian variety of goat cheese somewhat. The sourness penetrates my senses, and I have yet to taste this. Upon first sip my mouth comes instantly alive, like drinking lambic for the first time, all over again. Taste is much sweeter than any Cantillon Ive tried, excluding Rose de Gambrinus, but I believe its even a touch sweeter than even that beer. Flavor is magnificent, so well rounded and so delectable. The tartness melds perfectly with the sweetness. Cherries explode! Raspberries pummel! Grape skins entwine my taste buds and oaky tannins tie it all together. The tannic-style acidity lingers, sinking into my cheeks, the sides of my tongue go numb.

Lovely opaque, freshly crushed cranberry juice, the pearly white head was nice.  A few flakes didnt rain on its parade too much.
Wow, get your nose close to your glass and the aroma just grabs you by the collar and pulls you in.  As funky as Ive ever smelled from this brewery, which is saying a lot.  It smelled like red life savers, grapes and hay mixed in horse shit.  How could I possibly like this?  But I just do, maybe Ive got scatologic tendancies...
Bone dry and decent mouth-puckering acidity, it was very well attenuated.  The fruit was sort of there but it was more like freeze-dried grape peels.  The last time I had this was in Belgium and it had much more wine-like characteristics, but I think I liked this bottle better, the aroma sold me.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Goldorak"

4432,"2005-10-28",4.0,"A Mes rate: 
75cl bottle purchased during our wonderful visit to the brewery. It was not quite ready for consumption when we got it, in fact we were made to promise not to drink it until it was ready before it was given to us along with very specific storage instructions and dates. I think we just about made it on the date... However, I think this may have benefitted from being left alone for a little while longer. It was just slightly lacking in carbonation and that let the palate down just a little. As a resuslt it drank more like a wine but a little thinner in the mouth. Aroma is glorious as you would expect. Very wine like in many ways but with all the lambicness you would hope for too. In fact almost everything about this beer is exactly as the Cantillon description would lead you to believe. Half lambic, half merlot. And it is rather glorious. Appearance is a little boring however. Looks for all the world like a watered down merlot, a cloudy purpley red. Flavour... well what can I say? Its a red wine lambic. The grapes are clearly there as is the barnyardy lambic straw and butter. But they never really mix. I do not at all mean that in a bad way, they are just always separate. It switches from wine to beer, wine to beer, all the way up to the finish where it finally settles on the wine. Fine choice it is too. The finish is excellent and leaves me wanting more. Fantastic stuff all round. I wish I had the will power to have let it lie for a while longer, I would be very interested to know how it ages.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","MesandSim"

Toasty, musty, slightly metallic barnyard aromas (I know everybody says ""barnyard"" in reference to lambics, but I cant think of any other way to put it). The broad overview of the taste is like this: Tart up front, of course, that blends seemlessly into dry red wine flavors. But really, thats woefully inadequate to describe all the subtle changes and nuances that happen in every sip. I can say that as it warms, the wine flavors become more prominent, and occasional notes of lemon and oak pop up, as well. I wish i had a bottle to age a bit, but this was really great.

4432,"2005-05-31",4.5,"Appearance is of a dark cranberry juice mixed with a splash of grape juice. Has some lively carbonation lineage along the sides. Crunchy threaded bubbles of foam decorate the top in a dusty pinkish white. Very active and popping and light amounts of lacing in thin strings. Shrinks down fairly fast as its surface smoothes out some then to a nothing-like misty haze on top and a thin collaring.

Outstandingly strong aroma, which is nothing out of the ordinary for Cantillon. Lots of brisk and lively sour-tartness fully dancing amoung a floor of acidic fibers. Whole mustard seeds, sharp white cheese, dirty barn floor hay, and vinegar all add to a vineous strength of sour stuff tickling the nose. Like a red wine on lambic steroids.

Taste is no different. Tons of tickling sour-tart-acidic stuff. Vineous vinegars, layers of highly sour bread grains, old cheese, puckering sugars, and lambic yeast all make for a big effect of smooth and delicate dryness. Each sip brings another layer of dryness after the tart stuff clears a path. Not as funky as the smell eludes too. What I found unique and mcuh more to my liking about this compared to other Cantillons Ive had is that this was much more easier on the palate to control. It reminded me of a Saison with a kick of extra sour dough breads, yeast, and an addition of grapes.

Feathery medium/heavy dryness and tart supplied, multi-layered, acidicness keep this sucker pretty tongue tingly and cheek-scraped dry. One of the things I couldnt quite get used to was its overall dryness. The sour stuff leads right into it and it takes every corpuscle in your mouth prisoner as it ghostly leaves all sorts of weird cottony-tart left overs. Again, like a grapey saison.

Drinkability is OK, takes a good while to get used to. It has a nice saison quality to it that I tend to like over the other true lambics that Cantillon is known for. Think of it as a vinegar spiked red wine blended with a saison.","Twin Cities, Minnesota, USA","beermatrix"

4432,"2005-03-08",4.3,"2002 bottle consumed over the course of a couple weeks, Feb/Mar 2005.  Pours a lovely sour cherry red, perhaps like a soft-toned, light colored merlot. A bit of head at first and then nothing. There was liquid between the cork and the cap, but there was no explosion or even any gushing at all, upon removal.  Aroma is heavily cheesy, moldy, very raw and unadulterated manure/barnyard characteristics.  The burgundy does not show through heavily in the aroma, with only some light oak notes and a bit of sweet vinousness.  Its odd, but Im actually getting hints of sweet, almost spoiled-like fruits in the nose, which is very unexpected (thought it would be a heavily dry, grapeskin-like aroma).  Flavor is, yet again, superb IMHO.  Acids and oak surge forth and the palate is overloaded with ripe cheese, oak, and subtle, dark grape notes.  Ripe fruit notes, cherry pits, balsamic vinegar and a very strong note of strawberries.  Yes, I do belive I love the strawberry flavor in here.  Finishes tart and lightly acidic, losing some of the cheese as it breathes and warms.  I stoppered the bottle and tried it over the course of a couple of weeks and every time it was fantastic.  As the carbonation began to die off heavily, at the end of the bottle, there was a stronger sense of tannin-rich oak and dry berries/grapeskins.  Another very high rating from me of a Cantillon product, but I cant help it.  Its just so flavorful and not-overdone.  The barrel aging has a fairly strong influence on this beer, but is not too dominant and works very well with the barnyard and tartness.  Still, I could see this benefiting from even less barrel character.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

4432,"2005-02-24",3.9,"Purple Ribena colour with OK head retention, a first for Cantillon in my experience. Aroma features the typical Cantillon toastiness, light vanilla, blackcurrant, raspberry, musty attic smell, generic ""red wine"" smell and a tiny bit of diacetyl(!). Tastes incredibly like a red wine. Juicy fruit (as opposed to Juicy Fruit) character, not that its sweet at all, and a light tartness - its never really sour which kinda threw me. Its perhaps a tiny bit lifeless mid-palate and theres the faintest hint of tomato sauce flavour. Big savoury finish much like wine - peppery and lightly tannic. The balance between the fruit, tannin and acid is perfect. For a wine this really impresses me - blending with a beer means it lacks the overbearing alcohol and tannin flavour that so many wines (especially from this part of the world) have which really ruin it for me. For a wine/beer hybrid its also really good, though perhaps skewed a tiny bit too much towards wine, especially in flavour. Its just that for a wine/lambic hybrid it doesnt quite have enough lambic character to really impress me. A bit more funk and a fair bit more sourness and this would be brilliant. As it is its really good, fascinating stuff. Thanks Chuk. Oh yeah, how can this be 5% abv if they just blend with regular lambic???","Melbourne, AUSTRALIA","mullet"

To give it a great rating for nose you have to like lambics; this one had only hints of stinky funky, but its still a lambic.  The taste was less stinky, a little flat by lambic standards, with a long sour finish.  It was surprisingly thin and light in the mouth given the beautiful appearance.

The liquid pours a beautiful rosey ruby color with a finger of spritzey head that immediately fallst to ring the beer with large bubbles. This one is very wine-like in the color, somewhere between a blush and a dark red. The nose was true to the Cantillon form. Funky, sour, acidic, but with a nice fruity grape coming in behind the funk, smelling so damn good. The flavor. What can one say about liquid nirvana; something so awesome that I would be happy to drink exclusively for the rest of my life. What struck me most was how mellow and smooth this was. Ive had a few of the Cantillon line, but this was every bit as funkey, but much more mellow. Still sour and acidic and tart, but not puckering. The grape flavor hits secondarily behind the initial burst of sour and acid, but it serves to polish this beer like the finest diamond. The feel was a weak moderate to moderate, wtih a light, dancing bubble on my tonge. Nothing that got in the way, but enough to know it was there. Awesome balance on the pucker factor. Wow...wow, wow, wow. If there is anything left to say about the drinkability that cant be drawn from what Ive already said, I dont know what it would be. Hunt this beer. Drink this beer.

Almost no head, but theres that mysterious cloudiness I love in some bottle-conditioned beers which just seems to make the color complex. Huge aroma, very clean, balsamic, lightly farmy and surprisingly pretty sweet. Floral sweetness, dessert sauce, red wine-ish.. This defines classy. Field notes. Complex woody oak-like character. On the tongue, you really taste the grape skins out of it. Acidity level is masterfully controlled. Just the right lactic bite. It evolves into a malic fruitiness, passes through a moldy temporary state and finishes very leafy with remarkable mouth puckering properties. Cantaloup, pomegranate.. Big mouthfeel, full bodied, moderately carbonated, perfectly fitting imo and enhances global flavour deployment. Dryness hits you up and leaves a toy of an astringency with which I spent several minutes experimenting sips of water. What can I say, water tasted just sooo good after a sip of st-lamvinus. A beer that will haunt my memories for a long while. Post taste actually doesnt last all that long, but I still found myself trying to suck out the remaining flavours out of my tongue, like struggling for the last red grape of a whole harvest. Unique.

4432,"2004-10-03",4.5,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2005 Alright lets see what the commotion is all about.

Magenta.

I always find it kind of redundant to describe the flavors and aromas of a lambic. I usually dont feel like writing down ""snake skin, farmhouse, cobwebs, leather, barnyard"" and so on and so forth because almost every spontaneously fermented beer possesses these qualities. The difference between the best and the worst are how the flavors mold together. That being said, the aroma on the Saint Lamvinus is subtle. The sourness and traditional Gueuze qualities are toned down by the addition of the grapes. Complex. 

This is a really finely tuned lambic. Incredibly soft and mellow on the palate. The Cantillon lambic qualities are there providing everything in quotes above :) and the addition of the grapes provide an incredible flavor. Mouth puckering and simply to die for.

The aroma is beautiful--as fine as any that Cantillon makes--with a beauful grape resonance and some woodiness to mute out the lambic qualities.  The color is absolutely perfect--a Kool-Aid red with many hues blending together.  The flavor is sour with lovely mild fruity flavors, though it doesn't hit as pronounced as some of their others (the gueze from a keg beats this)...  Still, wonderful beer.

Pours a frothy and lively pink head on a deep red body. Sweet and sour aroma with blackcurrant notes. Flavor is tart fruity and woody (very Cantillon-like) with a dry finish. Quite fresh and complex and better than most other Cantillon lambics!

4432,"2004-03-16",4.0,"Definitely let this one warm up before trying it. The aroma while fairly cool gave me a distinct canned tuna and green olive vibe.

4432,"2004-03-13",4.0,"2002 vintage: Purple-shaded watermelon. Wispy   pinkish bubble ring. Mouthwatering dark grape essences hide underneath a firm horse blanket, phosphorus, and lightly charred wood aroma. Very crackly with plenty of support from the brett. Fruit hides much of the mustiness, but there is still plenty to go around. Soft body. Quiet carbonation. Bold medicine and dark grape notes are trailed by a substantial cheek-puckering tartness. Vague brett, dark grape notes and just enough airiness calm the sourness as the woodiness picks up steam. Marvelous harmony between the brisk tartness and brett. Mild chalkiness grits up the texture  and adds depth while blending effortlessly with the horse blanket. Light malt husks are present, but have little success in penetrating the late lemony tartness and woodiness. More rounded lemon than firm iron tartness. The dryness agitates the tartness at the finish and deposits a lingering blend of medicine, dark grape and brett in its wake. Just a tad more malt husk fullness is all this glorious brew needs.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

Very good combination of grapes and Lambic (where the Vigneronne is not as splendid as this one).","Aarschot, BELGIUM","diabel"
4432,"2004-02-09",4.3,"2001 bottling.  Nice ruby with hints of pink coming through on occasion.  Almost no head.  The aroma is strong and tart with plenty of barnyard character, cheese, tart grapes and some decent dark fruitiness.  The body is fairly light, but is lasting and enjoyable.  The sweet fruitiness cuts the extreme tartness and leaves the mouth pleased and wanting more.  The funkiness is present but not overbearing, and there is a touch of musty fruit.  This is a well crafted beer with great flavors and impecable balance.  It was a bit expensive, but I'm not upset about that, it certainly delivered.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
4432,"2004-02-03",2.2,"2002 bottle. Even though I am not into this style of beer this was certainly a  disappointment at $40 a bottle to say the least. It poured a large sized tan head with fine-medium sized bubbles that quickly dissipated. The body was semi-transparent and carbonated with a red-pink hue. The nose in my opinion was funky and not very appealing. The flavor was sweet, sour, tart, acidic and some fruit notes. The mouthfeel was dry and somewhat tingly. There was no lacing.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","hotstuff"
4432,"2004-02-03",3.1,"This 2002 bottled brew poured an extremely large head of light purple colored finely sized mostly diminishing bubbles that left behind no lace at all.  The body is a hazy semi-transparent purple tinted rose brown color with carbonation clinging to the sides.  The aroma is musty and a bit of horse blanket with a lot of funkiness to it.  The mouth feel is dry, very tingly, bubbly  and sour.  It lingers well into the finish.  The flavor is mild with acidic and metallic fruity notes to it.  This is another lambic that will require an acquired taste to appreciate.  It is a lot like some other lambics and it is definitely not for the faint at heart.  I can't find my way to rate this very well and for the $40 we paid for it, it is not worth the price.  I still prefer the Lindemans line.  Over 1050 beers rated now and I still have a hard time appreciating the complexities of the lambics.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","thedm"
4432,"2004-02-02",5.0,"UPDATED: AUG 8, 2007 Vintage Bottled 2002, Sampled November 24, 2003.
It is with some trepidation that I open this bottle.  When I peeled off the foil covering the top of the bottle, the cap was badly rusted and there were streaks of crusted beer running down the neck, as well as a small amount of fresh beer leaking from the cap.  Since I was not going to get another one of these in the foreseeable future I let it settle down in my dedicated beer cooler.

There is perhaps a hint of a hiss as I pop the cap 750ml bottle; hopefully this beer is not too far gone.  The cork feels very moist and is obviously fully penetrated from the beer, a slight acetic smell emanates from the cork.  Well I go for the cork pull.  The cork pops out, and yes, there is some carbonation here.  Perhaps it wont be as bad as I thought.

I pour the beer and low and behold it is very well carbonated.  The carbonation produces a couple of inch thick pink to light purple colored head, which, lasts longer than I was expecting.  The beer itself is a reddish/ light purple color, quite hazy as well.  There is a definite acidic aroma that emanates from my glass.  It is sour, though not intensely so.

As I take my first sip I note that there seems to be a large amount of body to this bone dry Lambic.  I wonder if the grapes have added some structure, as I was expecting it to be quite thin.  The grape character is certainly here, it is under the sourness, there is a bit of tannin here from the grapes.  There are some berry notes, which compliment the lemony acidity, it sort of underscores & picks the beer up.  As I peel the layers of this beer away I note that the berrygrape like flavor is definitely here.

As this beer warms slightly the wine grapes really start to pick up, especially in the finish.  I get an austere vinous slightly tannic ending.  The Lambic sourness definitely dominates, but this beer is infinitely better and more complex than the Cantillon Vigneronne.  The typical suite of Lambic flavors are here; leathery, musty, and sour.  Aromas of cat piss, musty cellar, citrus, vinegar, it is just wonderful to sniff away at.  I must get more of this.

A Lambic on its own, when made properly, is incredibly complex.  The Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and the Cabernet Merlot grapes just bring this to a whole other plane of existence.  This has got it all, and the grapes did not thin out the body of the Lambic like the Muscat grapes did to the Vigneronne.  This beer has convinced me to brew a grape-Lambic, perhaps a syrah.

Well I just finished my first glass of this wonderful beer; luckily I still have a second one yet to savor.  In my second glass the sour aroma has receded a bit.  The Brett character has become a much more noticeable, accompanied by some enteric notes as well.  The aroma is just wonderfully complex; I could just smell this beer forever.  So, I take an extended moment to do just that which leads to some ruminations on my part.  How can something that is described in such negative terms (enteric, sweaty  leathery  horse blanket, vinegar, barnyard, etc.) be so wonderfully enticing?  Well I dont know, but I truly love it.  The taste is again sour up front, but the body and finish of this beer is where the grape character shines.  Dont get me wrong, dont read too much into my description, this is by no means a wine, definitely a beer, definitely a Lambic, but the marriage of wine and beer is pure genius in the form of Lambic.  The complexity here, I never would have guessed that grapes could add so much to the complexity of a traditional Lambic product.   Unlike most fruit Lambics (including many that I really enjoy, even most Cantillon products) the grapes take nothing away from the Lambic character, they only add a whole other dimension that intertwines and picks up the character of this Lambic.

No one else should try this beer; I sincerely believe that that it is all meant for me.  No one else will be able to appreciate the stunning complexity and subtlety that is this beer.  After reading this I am sure that anyone else trying this will be let down, so dont get it, seriously, Ive got dibs on the rest.

On a serious note, I really would not recommend anything less than an 8 oz serving of this (and a full 12oz would be adequate, but a 750 would be much better).  This beer is just far to complex and needs, nay requires, deep contemplation and time to savor and explore this nectar.  Please deeply explore this beer if you get a chance, it is well worth it.

Stunning, contemplative, world class; these are all words that just do not do justice to this beer.  Please Jean-Pierre, make this a regular beer in your line-up.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"
4432,"2004-01-08",2.9,"Initially this beer has a lot to make up as I never would of bought this except to attend the 3F birthday gathering.  I never would of spent the $40 a bottle for myself as I find the other Cantillon already vastly overpriced but I thought it would be good for the gathering, which I was not able to attend afterall.   
As for the beer itself it has a nice blush color but other than that it is a typical Cantillon guezen with the grapes imparting very little except in color.  This goes down as the most overpriced and worst deal of any beer.","Ohio, USA","redlem"

2003-12. Pours a hazy rosey colour. Aroma is predominantly sour cherries with an underlying profile very similar to their gueuze. Flavour is strongly tart and acidic.
