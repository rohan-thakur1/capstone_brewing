4523,"2017-05-04",3.7,"16 oz acquired at brewery at at Im not normally someone who pick up a pilsner to drink it, but this was is quite nice. Cracker like malts and biscuit with sharp carbonation. little hay and a bit of hope character possibly from dry hopping.","seattle, Washington, USA","cobaink2"
4523,"2017-04-26",3.7,"16 oz. can from poisoneddwarf - thanks again! Pours a clear gold witn a finger of fizzy white head that settles into a ring and eventually vanishes altogether. Takes some time, though. Has a lingering bitterness at the end, but before that you get a big dose of crackery and slightly sweet pils malts, floral and spicy and grassy hops, and straw. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a malty, bitter mouthfeel. Not quite as clean as I like these but really well done overall.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
4523,"2017-04-10",3.8,"16 oz can, thanks for picking this up Poisoneddwarf- Pours lightly hazy golden with a medium white head that reduces to a blanket and spotty lace. Aroma is crisp, lemon, clean, biscuity. The taste is grainy, lemon, medium level bitterness that lingers. Refreshing.","Idaho, USA","Beerdrinker79"
4523,"2017-04-08",3.8,"16 oz can from todays release. Aroma is floral, grainy, wheat cracker. Pours slightly hazy golden with a one finger white head with good retention. Taste is highly bitter for style with flavors matching the aroma and significant spicy hop character. Awesome pils.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"
4523,"2017-03-02",3.7,"Can, courtesy of riversideAK, pours with a clear gold body that supports a thin white head. The aroma offers up floral hops, a dash of lime, some pils like malts and then some breadiness. The taste delivers a nice floral and slightly lime citrus hop bitterness rolling into sweet cracker malt like breadiness that takes this into the finish. The Noble hop like bitterness persists throughput the experience. Overall it could be a tad less sweet. Still a nice pils.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4523,"2017-01-28",3.0,"Refrigerated 16 oz. aluminum can poured into a snifter. Slightly hazy golden with small white head. Aroma is light grain, light body, medium carbonation, and a little lacing. Taste is light grain and lower light floral hops.","Charleston Area, West Virginia, USA","weihenweizen"
4523,"2017-01-22",3.9,"Draft at the brewery, its clear amber-hued gold with an average sized head. Malt-driven aroma is toasted cereal and baguette and a touch of dried hay not unlike authentic Moravian malt. Its semi-sweet and savory and lightly bitter, medium bodied with mild acidity. Superbly clean fermentation profile and succulent malt sugar make this one an especially nice experience. Minimally hoppy, which is okay, and whats there is pleasant, coming across as cracked pepper, herbs, and lemon, close to the expected character of Czech Saaz. Quite a surprise here, very close to true Czech Svetly.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"
4523,"2017-01-14",2.8,"Tap at the brewery. Aroma is grainy, bready, not much noble hops. Taste is the same. Oily mouthfeel. Not my kind of Pilsner - its too grainy and lacks the elegant earthy hop character.","Garching b. München, GERMANY","SinH4"
4523,"2017-01-10",3.4,"16 oz can poured at home. I have a wish list for Holy Mountain beers to hit the canning line. This wasnt one of them, but Im still stoked. Poured to a Pils mug. Bright, shiny golden pour with a ton of foam head. Very mild straw grain aroma. Flavor is quite nutty on the grain. First impression for sure. Grassy second thought. Plenty of earthy notes to go around. Slight cream, just barely sweet. Cool and very refreshing finish. A good pilsner here, but wouldnt call it great.","Kenmore, Washington, USA","andrewje41"
4523,"2016-12-24",3.5,"Draft: Poured golden with white bubble fluff head. Nice grain nose. Sweet grainy very nice.","Wasilla, Alaska, USA","SHIG"
4523,"2016-08-18",3.7,"on draft at the brewery. One of the lightest yeast and malt flavored czech pils Ive had. Very sessionable and light mouthfeel and body. Atypical to style and was a disappointment. However a lightly drinkable beer and very pleasant.","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"
4523,"2016-05-18",3.7,"Awesome clean crisp nose of grassy hops, sourdough bread, a touch nutty. Pours golden, nice white head. Crisp clean with nice hop notes. Grassy with a little peppery bitterness. Easy to crush, well made.","Shoreline, Washington, USA","riversideAK"
4523,"2016-02-26",3.8,"Hazy light tan. Rich hop nose with abundant pale malts. Balanced, fresh, nice bitterness.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","Oakes"
4523,"2016-01-14",3.8,"Draft at HM. Bright yellow gold, very soapy head. Great, bright pils aroma, smells like Europe. Gorgeous grassy hop, sweet, inviting. Another delicious HM lager! A bit juicier than the czech equivalent in my book, but delicious.","Seattle, Washington, USA","luttonm"
4523,"2015-12-19",4.0,"Draft at Holy Mountain. Hazy golden pour, pretty fluffy white head. Nose and flavor are beautiful, with soft bitterness, spicy and herbal Euro hop presence, and gorgeous grain character with tinges of sourdough. Softer carbonation than many American pilsners, but still quenching and highly quaffable. Outstanding Czech pils; i could alternate this and Victory Prima or Braumeister for the rest of my life and be very content.","Seattle, Washington, USA","craftycarl21"
4523,"2015-12-06",3.7,"On tap at Holy Mountain, pours a hazy golden with a small off-white head. Aroma is very grainy and grassy, with lots of roasted cereal grains, grass and herbal notes. Flavour is extremely fresh, with loads of grass, toasted grains and a slight herbal quality. Super fresh and grassy, how I like my pilsners. Really nice.","Vancouver, British Columbia, CANADA","mcberko"
4523,"2015-12-06",3.5,"Draft - Nice grains and a touch of sweetness. Clear gold with a decent white head. Lots of grains and a touch of bitterness. Solid.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
4523,"2015-11-28",3.7,"On tap at the brewery. Cloudy yellow. Corn and other cereal grains on the nose. Very mild grassy citrus. Flavor is mild, but intensifies into caramel and biscuity notes. Not usually a pils guy, but I could easily drink quite a bit of this.","Seattle, Washington, USA","trevor211"
4523,"2015-07-26",3.6,"Clear orange gold. Aroma grass honey barley. Tastes umami yeasty honey barley slight sourdough. sorta in your face, but one of the better beers I had from them.","Seattle, Alabama, USA","nealblind"
4523,"2015-05-31",3.8,"Draft, first at HM and then again tonight at Hellbent. Clear burnt orange with white head. Aroma: nice grassiness; creamed corn; honey; light sulfur. Taste: moderate honeyed sweetness, balanced bitterness (enough to clearly contribute, but not even remotely overbearing). Medium body, creamy texture, lively carbonation. Easily crushable.","Moscow, Idaho, USA","Prufrockstar"
4523,"2015-05-27",3.5,"On tap @ Holy Mountain. Pours bright clear yellowish golden with medium lacy white head. Aroma is crisp dry malt, notes of white corn. Taste is creamy Pilsner malt, sharply dry spicy hops that linger through the finish. Crisp and light wth full mouthfeel. Not my favorite style, but solid beer.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"
4523,"2015-05-26",4.2,"stellar pilsner that no one gives a shit about. dry, crisp, refreshing, rich malt flavor, appropriate bitterness in all the right places around the palate. damn good beer.","Washington, USA","lachrymalisis"
4523,"2015-05-17",4.0,"Growler from Last Drop.

Super grassy nose, lovely pilsner taste. Nice late bitterness. I can see why these guys have rocketed to the top Seattles beer scene. Not too much west coast snap; this is big but more authentic than most pilsner efforts from around these parts. Better than the Holy Mountain lager beer purportedly in the same style.","Seattle, Washington, USA","OldMrCrow"
4523,"2015-05-06",3.9,"Draft at hmbc. Pours a slightly hazy medium gold with a dense and fizzy white head. Mild sulfuric nose. Grassy. Creamy medium body with lively carb. Minerally, softly grassy mid palate. Long minerally finish.","Mukilteo, Washington, USA","after4ever"
4523,"2015-05-01",3.8,"1st rater, beat you Chris. TAKE THAT! Abbey and I are out and about looking for potential places to move. We really just want to take advantage of Seattles views. Well we found an apartment with views of Mt Rainer all across the apartment, I mean each bedroom and living room. Oh and its right on Elliot Bay, so you have that beautiful view. Unfortunately, we found the perfect place buttttttt we cant move for another 2 months and this place wnt sit around. The upside, the apartment is close to this brewery and I get to drink this clean and malt lager. Hope bite at end. Not quite as good as the zweikel.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"
