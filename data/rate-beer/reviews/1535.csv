Aww yeah - hops you can smell from across the room upon decapping. Thats how you do a wheat beer! Lovely bright NZ hops impart fruity and almost vinous notes on a light, almost crisp wheat base. Id love to get this fresher, actually, even though it doesnt seem particularly faded. Another nice example of the Hopfenweisse style, right up there with Driftwoods Entangled, and really worth trying if you find it. (16/20)","CANADA","UXO"

On retrouve les épices et la banane en bouche, mais elle reste plutôt en arrière-plan, et on note également un alcool bien perceptible, peut-être un peu trop en fait.

Flavour is citrus, mild bitterness, bready, tropical fruits, yeast, sweet and then dry. Good take on a wheat beer though not my favourite style.","Alberta, CANADA","andrewturba"

Aroma of wheat, yeast passionfruit, sweet tropical hops, slight sourness and a few floral notes. Taste is wheat, yeast, tropical fruits and goes from sweet to dry.

1535,"2013-06-17",3.6,"(On draught at Brydens, Toronto ON, June 14th 2013) Pours a very cloudy yellow with a fluffy/ white head that didnt last. Aroma has fairly restrained citrus hops that werent particularly bitter/pithy (NZ style) and a little fruit over top of a strong core of banana, a bit of clove, herbal notes and some wheat malt. Hopping doesnt over-power the hefe character. On the palate there is some bright citrus and tropical fruit juiciness to augment the yeast, banana, wheat, bubblegum and spice of the hefe. Moderately sweet to start, but a decent bitterness for the style builds and it finishes dry with hops and powdery yeast. Medium body, fairly heavy prickly carb but fairlly on-style. Good weizen with the hop character adding to the experience without overpowering it.","Linköping, Sweden/Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","neongolden"
1535,"2013-06-03",3.2,"Pours a hazy straw yellow with a big pillowy white top.  Aroma is astringent floral and citrus hop with wheat.  Taste is bright citrus and floral hops with wheat chewiness.  Not a bad beer but not their best.","Ottawa, Ontario, CANADA","cfrancis"
1535,"2013-06-02",3.1,"Bottle - 600ml. Cloudy golden body with a thin white foamy head. Decent malty/hoppy aroma with piney and coriander hints. Its fresh hoppy taste carries piney and citrusy notes. Ends with a good bitter/herbal finish. Not bad.","Gatineau, Quebec, CANADA","Eructoblaster"
1535,"2013-05-28",3.7,"Bottled March 27th. Props on the new plastic labels rather than the old ones that ripped extremely easy. Pale yellow. Aroma of clove and banana, as well as some citrus from the late hop addition. Taste of bubblegum, spice, banana, and just a small touch of mangos. Medium carbonation, oddly bitter. Overall a nice summer beer. Light and refreshing.","Ontario, CANADA","Kekumba"
1535,"2013-05-12",4.0,"My Bottom Line:
Citrus fruit, flowers and bubblegum coalesce over banana esters in this creamy Hopfenweiss.

Further Personal Perceptions:
-A creamy tower of foam protects the cloudy pale blond.
-The dosage of hop resins and overall hop character with the fermentation character is perfectly done.
-The fluffy carbonation and healthy sugars make for a highly drinkable example.
-The citrus fruit character is reminiscent of lemons as much as starfruit.
-The finish is moderately bitter.

1535,"2013-05-03",3.5,"On tap at Brydens. Pours a hazy yellow with a good amount of fine white head that dissipates quickly. Smell is fairly sweet with a good amount of wheat, cloves, and a tiny bit of citrus. Palate is light bodied with slightly below average carbonation. Taste is pretty good, slightly sweet at first before getting a bitter kick that appears again in the tail end of the sweet aftertaste. Good, but theres definitely better choices.","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","GuillaumeCL"

1535,"2013-04-21",3.0,"On tap at Bakers Street Station, Guelph.  Looks like grapefruit juice - gold-coloured and super cloudy.  Aroma of wheat and vanilla.  Taste has wheat, banana, spice, with a pretty harsh bitter and alcoholic finish.  Surprising since the IBUs and ABV arent that high.  Decent body.  A good enough wheat beer.","Waterloo, Ontario, CANADA","kevinsenn"

Yeasty, herbal and hoppy along with lemon, wheat and an average bitter finish. Average to medium bodied. Not only was this better then I expected but I will have it again -- good stuff.

2013-03-23. Murky orange juice like body, small white head. 3+ Very hoppy yeasty character to the aroma. Interesting flavour, a lot of yeast mixes with fairly bitter hops, giving it a lingering bitterness long into the finish. Light lemon and grass undertones. Average plus to medium bodied palate. 3++ Im told the bottled product will be less yeasty, which will likely add a increased level of nuance to it since the flavour at this point is dominated by yeast and hops. Enjoyable, Id happily drink it again as is so I am curious to try it again if I get a chance. 7/3/7/4/15 - 3.6  On tap at Beaunly Event, Only Cafe, Toronto","Toronto, Ontario, CANADA","jercraigs"
