188,"2015-04-27",4.5,"Appearance: Served up a near black body with a scant, powder-like, beige-colored head.

Smell: A welcome, soothing blend of high-grade coffee, chocolate, vanilla-infused sugar and roasted malts. Light, fleeting hints of dark fruits and shredded, toasted coconut.

Taste: A sweet, succinct roasted maltiness with a taste akin to the chocolate topped donut one might find at Dunkin Donuts. Very well-integrated coffee character (additionally, Im a big fan of 1000 Faces since catching them at the Freedom Farmers Market). Lightly charred sugars. Scant dark fruitiness. A light bitterness, which seems more attuned to the roasted malt quality. Modest coconut mingled in. Some vanilla showing near the sweetish, roasty, chocolaty finish. It all tastes great and it all tastes great together.

Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. Smooth mouthfeel.

Overall: This day, I think we can all say together, without a hint of irony: Koko Buni is one damn fine beer.","Woodstock, Georgia, USA","ChainGangGuy"

188,"2015-02-08",4.2,"Succulent, satisfying. Oddly enough, I first tried this at a friends wedding party in Athens a month prior and fell in love with it. All the elements are in perfect balance and harmony with one another. Also, its a beer that doesnt feel the need to be approaching the 10% mark. Great stuff, really. With new breweries springing up all over Georgia, many are, well, not so great, but Im really digging the stuff coming from CC and look forward to trying their other beers.","atlanta, Georgia, USA","thebeernurse"
188,"2015-01-23",3.6,"Sample at the Southern Filling Station. Black, with a brown ring. Immediate coffee, with some vanilla, caramel, and cloves. Very sweet, with a harsh, roasted bitterness.

188,"2014-12-26",4.5,"Comes out of tap rich coffee brown with nice tan head. Aroma has strong quality coffee overtone and malty underpinning. Quality coffee dominates the flavor while letting roast malt and semi-sweet chocolate notes through. Heavy texture has fizz to spare. Comforting and coffee-ish Creature!","Georgia, USA","Cybercat"
188,"2014-11-16",3.9,"UPDATED: JAN 14, 2017 This is a milk porter with coffee, toasted coconut, and cocoa nibs.

Plenty of coffee and coconut in the nose and obvious coffee. The coffee is perhaps more obvious in the flavor. Both sweet, especially up front, and mildly bitter.
 
O: very rich and mildly sweet overall, this should be a fine dessert beer.
