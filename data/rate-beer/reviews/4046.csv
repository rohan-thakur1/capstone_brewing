4046,"2016-02-15",4.2,"Draft at Cellarmaker. Pours a hazy gold color with a small white head that laces the glass and settles into a ring. Another dank pale ale here, with citrus and tropical fruits, particularly the melons, herbs and spices, pale malts, and grass. Light-bodied, with medium carbonation, and simultaneously dank and dry on the mouthfeel. Fun, fresh, nice. I have no idea what HBC 344 is but this one really pops. Fantastic APA.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"

Big watermelon, gooseberry, and cantaloupe. Solid, but mild, bitterness. Light malt flavor and sweetness as well. Big tropical and fruity pebble flavor to go with all the citrus fruits. Intensely zesty. Damn good.","Dublin, California, USA","brokensail"

4046,"2016-01-30",4.0,"On draft at Cellarmaker. It pours a lightly hazed yellow color with a white head. The aroma has that typical Cellarmaker potent blast of fresh citrus and tropical fruit. A little bit of hop spice. The flavor is full with grapefruit and pineapple. Crackery malt as the base. A little spicy bitterness. Crackery and bready with a lightly creamy mouthfeel that sends this one over the top for me. Very tasty.","Livermore, California, USA","joeneugs"

4046,"2016-01-29",4.1,"Growler shipped across the country in a couple of days -- thanks a ton, misterburd. This is one cool beer. Despite the name, its as heavy on the dank hops as the citra fruity ones. It smells absolutely fantastic (like earth and fruit), but I found the taste to be a bit soapy from the Mosaic. Still, thats personal taste, and theres no denying that this is one insanely good beer.","Durham, New Hampshire, USA","thepatrickman"
