Aroma is mild coffee, cocoa, and distant chocolate. Intense solid mouthful of flavour. Oh, wow. Overwhelming in its initial boozy richness. After Ive settled down a bit I notice toffee, raisins, cocoa, dark chocolate and late Irish coffee. Really sticky in the mouth and the glass.

This particular bottle was a 2014 bottle so just over 3 years old. Pours a oily dark almost black colour with a cream like head. Aroma has big big licorice which surprises me a little. Then whiffs of dark fruits, probably amplified a little by the cellaring, coffee, dark chocolate and big roast. The taste is roasty too and with lots of licorice. Getting next to no sweetness.

Pours black with a medium tan head that settles slowly. The boozy aroma is strong with this one, with plenty of coffee and chocolate, lesser caramel, and hints of licorice and raisin. The taste is bitter, but not overly so. Very mildly sweet as well. Alcohol and chocolate stand tall, heavy roasted malts are found, and I still get lots of coffee. Subtle undertones are licorice and vanilla. Long chocolate aftertaste. Its medium bodied, has a creamy texture, and with minimal carbonation. For as potent as this is, Im astonished by how smooth and easy this goes down. Especially by how much the alcohol presence comes through.

3442,"2017-01-30",4.6,"750ml bottle from 2014, bought from Brewdog.com (£15.25):
Great stuff from AleSmith again here & a beer that was every bit as good as Id hope for going in; it was definitely worth the wait in cracking this bottle open. The beer was kicked off by a lot of darker, roasted malts & coffee flavours but it was also a touch sweeter than expected thanks to the sugars & chocolate, but also the darker fruits & vanilla that featured too. The beer was quite rich & complex with good carbonation & only a little of the 12% abv. showing nearer the end of the nose & taste, something that helped the beer down very easily. The beer was very much a moreish offering with some dry touches nearer the end & some subtle darker fruits coming through to keep things interesting at times.; I really enjoyed drinking this one & it seemed to go down slightly better than the Vietnamese Coffee edition that I tried on-tap last year; an excellent beer that you definitely need to try, its one that Ill be on the hunt for again now.","SCOTLAND","flying_pig"

It arrives with bright, acidic coffee with a little bit of spice and hops before transitioning into a smooth, creamy malty middle. It finishes very nicely with plenty of bold coffee notes, brown sugar, and some alcohol. The warming of alcohol is present throughout the palate but is especially noticeable in the finish. Once warm, the coffee notes stand out the most and followed by some more sweetness and alcohol. Smooth, heavy body; low carbonation; finishes warm, long; dry as hell.

3442,"2016-12-24",3.7,"Personal rating #5656.  25.4oz foiled bottle, BOTTLED ON 01/27/16 (or 07/27/16, hard to tell). Nose strongly of chocolate and coffee, also tries to fill the room with the scent of alcohol. Pour is very dark brown thats not completely given over to the dark side but that collects as just sub-pitch in the glass, head is large and fluffy-rocky tan. Taste very sweet and very fruity, lots of red berry with plum, black currant, outright grape, and cherry. That fruit ester profile combined with fine mouthfeel reminds me of Belgian yeast at higher temps, sort of fresh Rochefort, but Im not sure it adds in what should otherwise be a sledgehammer of a beer. Chocolate, coffee, and licorice are the supporting base while the fruit just runs wild on top. Skips over the roastier and earthier notes though and permits only a thin, wispy bitterness. Super sticky lips and a light body (!?), warmth and fine/delicate burn in the throat, still too much alcohol showing roughly even if by intent; a dessert beer, subtle caramel and developing scorched notes behind the sugar, crème brûlée tinted dark. Its overrated for sure (seriously, Californians, this isnt any better than the boozers from Southern Tier), but still a treat. [2016.12.24: 3.7]","New Jersey, USA","ganache"
3442,"2016-12-24",4.7,"From the black foil wrapped 750 ml. bottle. Deep, black colored pour under a modest tan head. The head fades. The aroma is full of rich dark sweet malts, coffee-like characters, fig, prunes, dark bread, char, and a low but earthy hop profile. The 12% alcohol is almost invisible. Full, smooth body. The flavor is about as good as it gets and I gave it a ""10"" with all those dark sweet roasted malts, dark fruits, integrated alcohol, and slightly biting dry bitterness to finish. I can see why this gets 100 out of 100 although Im not prepared to go quite that high. But it is quite an amazing beer.

Poured out oily black. I dont really comment on the head, but this one had a rich creamy cafe au lait colored head. 40ºSRM.

Nose is actually milky and sweet and reminiscent of caramel, toffee, dates. The roasty aromas are coffee, charred wood, light wood smoke, Over ripe stone fruit with honey prunes and black plums being top on my list. Dark grape juice.

Mouthfeel is full and syrupy. Palate has maple syrup, dates, date palm sugar and dark caramel and burnt sugar. Light creme brulee. Nice hit of alcohol up front and in the middle. Malt palate is broad with maltesers, malted milkshakes providing a strong almost milky base on which to taste the roasted barley and coffee flavors. The bitter takes on a fuller, more pleasing dimension because it is ""lengthened"" by the malt. There is a spicy component ot the tail end of the palate as well, medicinal and spicy, with anise and licorice, overall comes across like ouzo.

Apperance of used motor oil with a thick dark tan head that settled quickly, and left plenty of lace. Flavors of roasted coffee, which was heavy all the way through.

3442,"2016-08-19",4.7,"Piwo leżakowane było ponad rok i jest pierwszym piwem, które kupiłem w sklepie Bierland - Kraina 1000 Piw ;-) 
 Kolor:  Czarny, nieprzejrzysty. Ciemny jak smoła. 
 Piana:  Beżowa, drobnoziarnista, średniej wysokości. Opada do grubej oponki. Przy przechylaniu sniftera pięknie spływa po ściankach otaczając całą powierzchnię szkła. Lacing b.dobry, chociaż nie perfekcyjny. 
 Zapach:  Aromat jest pierwszorzędny. 
Od pierwszego niuchu nozdrza atakuje słodycz cukru trzcinowego, odrobiny wanilli, dużo karmelu. W oddali ciemne owoce i delikatna paloność.
Czekolada deserowa miesza się z pralinkami z dodatkiem szlachetnego alkoholu w środku. Zapach bardzo wyraźny i kompleksowy. 
 Smak:  Pierwsze skojarzenia to śliwki w czekoladzie. Potem odrobina wiśni.
Potężna czekoladowa słodycz. Pralinki czekoladowe oblane karmelem. W dalszym rzucie sporo wanilii. Na końcu języka kawa Mocca ze spienionym gorącym mlekiem.
Odrobina toffi i przypalony karmel. Piwo jest słodkie, tęgie, rozpływające się w ustach. Paloności jest zaledwie odrobina. Pełne ciało, monstrualna tekstura. RIS jest gęsty, oleisty, jedwabisty. Słodycz rozchodzi się równomiernie po ustach, podniebieniu i spływa wprost do żołądka.
Goryczka średnia w kierunku niskiej. Finisz lekko kawowy.
Alkohol rozgrzewa od środka, ale jest bardzo dobrze ułożony.
Myślę, że świeższa warka mogłaby być alkoholowa. Leżakowanie ułożyło alkohol i sprawiło, że odczucie w ustach jest bardzo gładkie. Delikatnie zbyt wysokie wysycenie.
Zamiast niskiego - średnie.
Doskonały trunek! Degustacyny i szlachetny. 
 Wysycenie:  Średnie. 
 Podsumowanie:  

Perfekcyjny Russian Imperial Stout. Może nie mój Top 3, ale z całą pewnością Top 10.
Warto było przeleżakować to piwo ponad rok. Alkohol się ułożył, a aromat i smak bardziej się wyostrzył.
W smaku i aromacie złożone, wielowarstwowe z wieloma akcentami. Z najważniejszych z nich: wiśnie w czekoladzie, śliwki, kakao, wanilia, cukier trzcinowy, przypalony karmel, toffi, kawa z mlekiem i gęsta czekolada.
Zaledwie odrobina paloności.
Tęgie, jedwabiste, oleiste ciało.
Alkohol pięknie ułożony. Nie można chcieć niczego więcej.
Jest pięknie ;-)","Sosnowiec, Poland, POLAND","Biroholik"

3442,"2016-06-22",3.0,"I probably had this for the first time around a decade ago. I bet this has come around a few tastings in life. I always thought I enjoyed this beer. Have had a few of the variants on tap as well. But I saw this beer on tap at Chucks for 6.50 for 16oz and was able to use my little growler (a gift from McBerko and maybe the best thing he has ever given me). I thought this is my chance to really check this beer out again. I am highly disappointed. It tastes like sweet chocolate syrup with a bug burst of roasted and acidic malts. You can see the sweetness covering up a lot of the acidity. It comes off as cheap Hershey syrup but thick. You know how that cheap chocolate syrup has a tartness to it, well that is present here from the acidity. Really messes with the palate. An alcohol heat is present as well. Again, the sweetness covers it up but it peaks through anyway. Again diminishing the beer. I can see why in a small burst, at a tasting, and a decade ago I could have loved this. Or maybe the beer was better a decade ago, I am sure Alesmith has gone through some changes.

De koffie is het meest dominant in het aroma, gevolgd door tonen van chocolade, geroosterde mout, vanille en donker fruit als pruimen en rozijnen. Het smaakpallet is vrij zoet voor een Imperial Stout, veel koffie, gebalanceerd met zoetere chocolade tonen, en een lichte bitterheid van geroosterde mout en hop. De carbonatie is zacht, en de afdronk is lang en zacht bitter, alcoholisch verwarmend. Een prachtige complexe Stout, maar nog niet het maximale niveau, ik heb nog betere op, ook uit de USA, zoals de Serpents Stout van Lost Abbey.

Aroma:

3442,"2015-09-12",4.8,"So youve had some great imperial stouts, and wonder whether this one, rated number 11 or 12 in the world, and costing a few quid, is really any better. Well, it doesnt do anything particularly differently to the other great stouts. But it does do what it does extremely well. Black as pitch, covering of coffee coloured head. On the surface - body is thick and creamy, aroma is coffee and chocolate, flavour has nice toasty malts, and its very drinkable given the big big alcohol content. But give it time and explore a bit and there is a lot more to come. Leave it rolling in the mouth, and the carbonation (and possibly the alcohol) starts to tingle a bit, leaving a frothy feel. Get your nose nice and close for a few seconds, and you get nuts, dried fruit, soy, wood and whisky notes. Hold it in the mouth for a while, and fruit flavours push themselves over the cocoa powder - dark fruits, berries and a touch of cherry. So, if you dont want to analyse too much, its a ridiculously tasty beer given that its powered by 12% of the bad stuff. Dig a bit deeper, and there are plenty of subtexts to enjoy.","Coventry, West Midlands, ENGLAND","Sjohnh"

My favorite thing about this beer is the oily, heavy body, and the way the low carbonation slowly transforms the beer in your mouth from liquid to what feels like bubbles.

3442,"2015-09-01",4.2,"BOD 3/23/15. Pours as dark as pitch black on a starless night. World class head volume, lacing and retention.

Almost world class nose of dark chocolate, molasses, hints of dark fruit (plum, raisin), vanilla, caramel and coffee.

Full bodied with a rich creamy texture. Below normal carbonation with no effervescence in the middle and a nice burst in the somewhat prickly finish.

The flavor profile is outstanding. It is intense, complex and reasonably balanced. However, the alcohol is not well hidden and produces an astringent alcohol flavor that prevents this exceptional stout from being world class. It begins with slightly bitter dark bakers chocolate, cocoa, that hints at sweetness. This flows into a rich sweet molasses with strong caramel notes. The middle is slightly bitter with roast and hop characteristics. Underneath are subtle notes of dark fruit, although not as pronounced as suggested by the nose. They are subdued by the arrival of the grain alcohol astringent flavor, which stays and lingers after the finish. The finish is a slow fade of rich chocolate and molasses that competes with grain alcohol astringency and finally succumbs to it. This is a world class stout that failed to make the grade due to the 12% alcohol content.","Gaffney, South Carolina, USA","tillmac62"

The aroma is big dark roasted coffee with vanilla and dark chocolate. A little alcohol aroma. Silky, velvety mouth feel. Flavor is sweet milk chocolate up front followed with big roasted espresso coffee flavor. The middle has some dark dried fruits and dark chocolate notes. Finishes with dark cocoa and big roasted coffee bitterness. No alcohol flavors which is crazy for a12% beer but in the finish you can feel the alcohol vapors.

Lorsque la Grande Dame à la robe noire et ténébreuse fait son apparition, chacun se tait en guise de respect. On assiste à la procession, admiratifs. Par où commencer? Dabord le col. Celui-ci est tissé très serré, dun brun riche et onctueux, couleur mocha. En remuant le verre, le liquide offre une rondeur absolument remarquable tant celui-ci sagrippe au verre et y adhère laissant sur son passage un léger film huileux. Mon coup de coeur va à la sous-mousse qui brouille le verre et peine à remonter lorsquon agite le verre un tant soi peu. Un look denfer! Ce stout présente un nez discret mais évolutif au fil de la température. On perçois du café, des grains rôtis, du chocolat noir. Cest plutôt léger. Les brasseurs ont visiblement opté pour un produit délicat qui ne verse pas dans les classiques sucrés, lourds et bruyants. Encore une fois, on garde silence pour ne rien manquer de la finesse de cette bière que nous nous apprêtons à déguster. (Note: nous navons pas quobservé silence pendant la soirée - nous avons aussi beaucoup discuté!). La bouche est la suite logique du nez. Les complices flaveurs de café, chocolat noir et de malts rôtis se partagent lavant-scène et offrent un spectacle grandiose dans une mise en scène sous le thème de la délicatesse et du raffinement.Léquilibre est simplement parfait. Ce stout est mémorable. Ce classique des tablettes américaines nest pas une référence pour rien!","Montréal, Quebec, CANADA","yourilevesque"

3442,"2015-02-16",5.0,"Bottle, cellared for just over two years. Appearance is jet black and completely opaque. A 1-2 finger frothy, foamy tan/light brown head which hangs around impressively. Aroma- rich, dense chocolate, espresso coffee, dark chocolate, treacle toffee, leather, some pipe smoke and tobacco, big, roast malt, vanilla hints even though its non-BA, maybe due to the age. Only the vaguest hint of alcohol is detectable. Smells luscious. Taste- just incredible. Loads and loads of dark chocolate and a huge coffee/espresso hit at the start. Despite the massive dark chocolatey bitterness, theres also a sweetness- treacle toffee/vanilla undertones, a hint of boozy dark fruits, rich chocolate cake, and more coffee than you know what to do with. More chocolate emerges as it warms up. The mouthfeel is perfect- not quite as syrupy as the other big imperial stouts. It clings to the mouth in the most satisfying way possible, is oily and slick but has a hint of carbonation to help things along. Long, lingering finish which goes on forever, like drinking a sweet, syrupy espresso. Hardly any alcohol in there, but it gives you a nice warmth. Utterly amazing.","Kent, ENGLAND","hohops"

The iPhone flashlight test reveal no light at all getting through, save at the very top edge of the beer, where the color turns a murky dark brown at the very edge of the liquid. No complaints about lacing during consumption - theres plenty, and its sticky.

S: Medium roast coffee strikes out of the glass straightaway, as fragrant as if it were freshly brewed. Beneath it, notes of a deep, dark roasted malt swirl about, alongside some hints of bitter dark chocolate and a vague nuttiness.

T: Coffee stout indeed, as those notes are again at the forefront, a medium roasted blend. The black-burned malts are there as well, a charred bitterness to them, with notes of scorched toffee and seared caramel alongside. Vague, ephemeral suggestions of dark cocoa and figgy fruit waft through the flavor profile here and there, and it finishes with a dark, deeply bitter, tongue-biting earth and ash bitterness that lingers long after the swallow.

M: As if drinking heavy whipping cream straight from the carton, this is a full, silky stout.

O: Not a bad coffee imperial stout at all. Definitely one of the better balanced versions Ive had, if still a bit heavy-handed on the hop side for my personal taste. In a style-neutral comparison, Id take the AleSmith Wee Heavy over this any day of the week and twice on any day ending with a Y, but this is far from a bad beer.","Ohio, USA","UrbanCaveman"

On the palate, theres a little hint of sweet dark/toffee malt at first with a bit of chocolate, but loads of coffee and roast pile in quickly and start to dry that out, powerfully espresso-driven in the middle with chocolate in support. The drying out continues into the finish, with roast coffee, roasted malt and a light grassy hop bitterness along with just a hint of alcohol helping the process.

Flavor is marked by fruit, licorice/anise, some chocolate, some coffee, even a touch of leather. Very sweet, almost cloying, but not quite. This is a really good imperial stout.","Osseo, Minnesota, USA","bookman10"
3442,"2014-08-30",4.4,"Another overrated US hype? Let me tear it to pieces... It pours a viscous-looking, black body with a long-lived, medium brown head, ok lacing. The aroma is strong and simply amazing: it has the perfect balance between dark roasted malt with accompanying coffee notes and sweeter and more gentle notes of sweet caramel and chocolate. Also bark and ash in the back. Very strong flavour of coffee that dries up the finish. Dark roasted notes and chocolate, vanilla in the back and hints of leather. The alcohol is very well integrated. The taste is a bit less sweet than most imperial stouts, the long-lasting finish is heavy bitter. Full body, oily to dry texture, soft carbonation. This is definitely on my top 3 ever!

3442,"2014-08-25",4.8,"UPDATED: APR 30, 2017 From a 750ml bottle on 25/8/2014. Pours close to black with a medium tan head. Has a strong, quite sharp aroma of caramel, coffee, dark fruit and a touch of booze. While pleasant, the nose doesnt scream necessarily scream world beater. Thankfully, the flavour does. This is a sweet luscious beast where chocolate, both milk and dark, ultimately hold sway. But there is so much more going on in the background, with the coffee very noticeable, along with caramel, vanilla, a hint of toffee, and dates, raisins and plums. While a real sweet, dessert like experience overall, the bitterness is also present in spades, with both roasty and hoppy notes in the mix. The palate is sensational - creamy, velvety and lovely with soft carbonation. Ridiculously easy to drink for 12%, this is just a magnificent drop. Behind only Peche Mortel in terms of impys for mine, and only just. You know youve had something really special when you pay $35 for a bottle of beer and feel like its terrific value. Rating: 4.5.

3442,"2014-08-08",4.8,"Aromas extraordinarios desde un principio. Es difícil distinguir aromas precisos en una bebida con notas muy diferentes. Sin embargo destacan en primera instancia el café, maltas tostadas, chocolate, vainilla, algo de frutas, quizá berrys y algo de licor al final.

En cuanto a su apariencia, completamente negra, corona de espuma abundante de media retención, cuerpo redondo y nula carbonatacion.

En boca es suave, cremosa y con un extraordinario equilibrio, ligeramente amarga en un principio y ligeramente dulce al final.

Al paladar es sumamente compleja y exquisita a la vez. Suave y cremosa, chocolate amargo en un principio, café posteriormente, notas dulces y malteses al final, destellos frutales, quizá zarzamora y notas a vainilla. Simplemente genial. Quizá al final, después del trago se perciben notas alcohólicas, quizá un licor o notas a brandy que te recuerdan sus 12 grados AVB.

3442,"2014-08-08",4.8,"Az első és utolsó meglepetés a fólia alatt lapuló kupak - nem pedig pezsgős dugó - megpillantása volt, lényegében (kissé előrehozva a talán nem túl kétes végkifejletet) ez volt az egyetlen dolog, amivel kapcsolatban másra számítottam az elfogyasztása során... Remekbe szabott illatát a kávé, kiváló minőségű étcsokoládé, pörkölt maláta és szivárványszínű édesség csodálatos harmóniája alkotja, mely egyébként meglehetősen ismerősen hat nem kevésbé illusztris típusok által hátrahagyott emlékképek által. Tejszínes, eszpresszós aromák ezek, melyek különleges pontossággal (de a legkevésbé sem egysíkúságuk miatt) képesek kialakítani az ízekkel kapcsolatos megérzéseket. Krémes, kávés, enyhén földes, összességében azonban a legmagasabb fokú bársonyosság hatását közvetítő, barátságos zamatok kelnek életre szánkban, melyeket a vártnál is intenzívebb mértékben csipkéz ki egy tűhegyes éllel szőtt alkoholfátyol, valamint markánsan karcosít egy férfias, komlós utóíz. Az a 12% alkohol a legkevésbé sem szándékozik a háttérben maradni, ebből a szempontból tehát semmi esetre sem foghatjuk az alattomosságra az üveg tartalmának elfogyasztása során előálló fiziológiai törvényszerűségeket. Az idő múlásával és a hőfok óvatos emelkedésével sem esik csorba ízének makulátlanságán, épp ellenkezőleg: leginkább kissé levegőztetve lép elő a kávészemek valódi természete, gömbölyded és sima, összetett aromája, a sör felsőbbrendűségének érzete, mely által a leghalványabb kétségünk sem marad afelől, hogy hősünk megérdemelten tetszeleg jelenlegi státuszában.","HUNGARY","adster"

Pours a dark brown, dense and opaque, with a nice tan head that is healthy and audible, fading quickly to a cola-like fizzy ring. Aroma is chocolate, leather, coffee, sweet, vinous dark fruits. Taste is chocolate and coffee up front, into a drier, bitter, cocoa middle, then into salty soy which fades in the finish into a superb roasted caramel malt and chocolaty red wine aftertaste. Palate is velvety smooth, creamy, and chewy in the end. Where is the 12%?! This goes down very easy.  Strange nutmeg quality that keeps it earthy and grounded.  Well done.","Minnesota, USA","Ericular"
3442,"2014-04-14",4.3,"Reviewed from notes.
The appearance had a one finger tan foamy head that dies within thirty seconds maintains a slightly thick lacing.
The smell had roasted coffee up front, raisin tries to come in fairly strong along with the coffee, but mainly stays just a tad behind, black licorice also tries to power its way through, but is just a tad more subdued then the other two aromas, for the most part Im impressed how all three are coming through as powerful as they are.
The taste was a dry roasty coffee, slightly sweet through the raisins and leaves a dry roasty yet also kinda toasty sort of coffee aftertaste, dry bitter coffee finish.
On the palate, it sat at/about a medium to heavy, actually probably closer to heavy, sessionable - not really but makes a good sipper. Carbonation seems to be good for the style and for me - dry and slightly smooth, coffee-like coating the tongue and mouth.
Overall, wow, this is a pretty good American Double / Imperial Stout, for as fresh as Im having this and not really detecting much booze and then looking at the ABV level, Im actually fairly interested in trying this one aged if I ever see it again.","Vermont, USA","Bulk_Carrier"

3442,"2014-02-20",4.4,"On tap poured into a 4oz shaker sample glass. Sampled both on nitro, and CO2 taps. Coffee, chocolate and caramel comes through the on the aroma, although, on nitro, the aroma in general is more subdued - although some berry and woody notes come through. It poured an opaque black with a tan head. The tan head retains as a wispy layer for the CO2 pour, and, of course, much thicker on nitro. Both lace well, although the nitro pour leaves a sheet of lace on the glass. Its a very balanced, medium-high sweet and medium bitter taste. More of the sweetness comes out on the nitro pour. Its a full bodied beer with soft carbonation. The nitro pour is much creamier and milky. Its slick and the CO2 pour has a bit more alcohol warmth to the finish whereas the nitro pour hides it better. Both leave a coffee bitter finish, although the nitro is a bit more clean. Theres a slight wood note that comes through on the nitro pour.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","ARH"

Apperance - the appearance is jet black and the head a tannish brown. The hangs out for a while, then it crashes down some.

Then you take a bucket of espresso and chocolate and pour it over said fire. Then you take that whole thing and strain it. Voila! Thats this beer.

You cant miss the coffee and dark chocolate in the nose or taste but below those two powerhouses there are more subtle flavours and aromas to find. A strong vanilla flavour arrives and then leaves: but a pod or two stay behind to dance with some hedgerow berries and a bag of toffees.

A: Freshly ground, roasted coffee up front, with strong raisin notes that compliment the coffee without over-powering it. Subdued black licorice lingers behind the other aromas.
A: Pours a deep, dark black with a slight mocha colored head along the sides of the glass.
T: The coffee jumps out initially, but notes of dark chocolate and dark fruits are also present. An underlying level of tartness balances out the rest of the bold flavors with a finish of dry malts and coffee and appropriate warming while going down.

3442,"2013-11-09",4.4,"UPDATED: JAN 31, 2014 Had this on tap during the Speedway craziness going on, this time had the Hammerhead version. The rating here is for Hammerhead.  Unfortunately walked in unknowingly that they had 12 Speedway varieties on tap. Because I didnt pre register, was only allowed to have regular or the new ""Hammerhead"" with no explanation as to wtf Hammerhead was. Once I took a sip, it was obvious to me it must be some coffee. Also I would like to note that I was very sad I could not try the others :-(

Pours pitch black with a small mocha head on top, looking super creamy. Aroma of huge acidic earthy coffee, a hint of chocolate, and just more huge coffee and espresso. Flavor follows with massive espresso, earthy and spicy, lightly acidic, with some hints of chocolate fudge in the background. Slight warming alcohol and lingering espresso. This really highlights the huge amounts of coffee here. Full bodied with medium carbonation. Honestly, this blew me away. One of the best coffee stouts I have ever had.

A bit of a cocoa powder lingering on the palate. Another sip reveals a bit of dark fruit. Medium mouthfeel, lighter than I had expected but still pretty chewy. Love this because it doesnt go all syrupy like some others. Really coffee forward with the right carbonation. Alcohol hidden but leaves a lingering warmth. Heavy lacing as it goes. Very nice.

3442,"2013-11-02",4.3,"This is my 900th rating. I hoped to choose a great brew for this occasion and I had the chance to get this bottle. Speedway stout has its reputation and I think there are just few beers like that.
75cl bottle. Black with medium to big head. head is tanned and thick.
NOSE : The beer has a huge coffee aromas, strong lactic notes, nuts and black chocolate. Hop aromas are well present with dominating orange zest. Strong toffee. 
SIP : thick body with oily texture. The carbonation is moderate. Mouth feel is amazing. The beer starts with sweet flavors of toffee and black chocolate. It develops more roasted malt aromas that mingle with warming booze. The booze aroma is reminding a good whisky since it reveals some wood notes. Wow. What a complex start. Lactic and toffee notes play well in the background. Further on the hop aromas are making the surface. The beer is getting more bitter but mostly reminding a coffee and black chocolate. Usually I would expect sour or dry notes but not in this beer ; it mixes well burned, sweet, booze and bitter together. No wonder its considered one of the best stouts in the world. 
OVERALL : Wow. I knew its gonna be a good stout but I was still surprised how much. The beer is perfectly well balanced with warming booze and black chocolate finish. I will surely come back to this brew.","Warszawa, POLAND","Swaroga"
3442,"2013-11-01",4.4,"Served from the 22oz. bottle into a globe glass...

Pours a opaque black with purplish brown edges, with a head that will build quick if poured too aggressive. Tan foam that drops off to sticky foam on the sides of the glass, a foam layer and a nice ring around the glass. So far, so good.

Smells of dark chocolate, roasted grains, coffee and a little alcohol. As with some other beers Ive tried, Im surprised by the lack of aromatics sometimes but I know that doesnt always mean something bad.

The first sip is dark chocolate, roasted grains, mocha, maybe some vanilla, a little hop presence and the alcohol at the end.

Smooth mouthfeel, medium to thick body that I loved just moving around as I tasted. Not much carbonation, which is fine. Finish is a little on the dry side, with the chocolate, roasted grains, mocha and the alcohol burn at the end.

Overall, this is one damn fine stout and I will definitely pony up the $$$ for more. While I still have a lot to learn about this style, this stout in particular is currently in my top spot and Alesmiths reputation is safe on my account.

A seriously sinister looking beer sits in front of me. Pretty much solid jet black, sump-oil-like liquid with a dense thick creamy light brown head, that would put most brown ales to shame, sits proudly atop...mocking me!
Intoxicating aroma assaults me with rich dark chocolate, molasses, cocoa, dark roast espresso grounds, earthy spice, roasted cashew, with a faint whaft of fortifying booze.
It;s thick. Its really thick! Viscous, oily, sticky on the palate - youd need degreaser to clean it off something! Really long on the tongue, low carbonation exacerbates this all.
Explodes on the body, just when I thought the aroma was intense enough...Cocoa, strong espresso, charred nuts, toffee, dark chocolate, black fruits, touch of citrus with Port-like rancio developing. Warming booze and firm but balanced bitterness on a very looong lingering, satisfying finish.

Aroma is coffee, licorice, chocolate and leather, moderately boozy. The taste is velvety chocolate, coffee, not too sweet which is nice, in fact it leaves a nice dry cocoa powder flavor in the finish, the coffee beans used here are obviously of high quality, not overbearing either, all blended wonderfully.

3442,"2013-10-03",4.6,"Pours an opaque black with a luscious coffee head into a snifter. Dissolves into a thin layer shortly after the aggressive pour.

Aroma is strong of coffee with some roasted malts, oak and a little earthiness.

Coffee plays the leading role in the flavor. The initial palate hit is of strong bitter coffee rounding into an earthy hop bitterness. Presence of oak and a slight bit of vanilla I also detect.

Mouthfeel is good and creamy. This is a coffee stout no doubt about it. Not even remotely close to too sweet. Low carbonation levels and it got better as it warmed.

I dont like a whole lot of AleSmith brews with the exception of this. Always glad when a bottle of Speedway comes my way as its way way too drinkable for a 12% big stout. It tastes better than the coffee I have every morning, but would probably get me fired from work if I make it my normal go to beverage.","Indiana, USA","jmarsh123"

S - Roast maltiness and coffee, as you would expect. However, the coffee is more sweet/fruity and light as opposed to an espresso or dark roast than many coffee stouts seem to use. Some nice dark fruit undertones. A little bit of alcohol too.

T - Roastiness and dark chocolate abound. Not too terribly coffee forward, likely due to what smelled like a lighter roast. There is a nice depth to the roastiness with notes of both dark chocolate bitterness and dark fruit sweetness.

M - Thick and chewy, almost syrupy but not quite. Little to no alcohol burn. The 12% is hidden well.

O - Loved the depths to the roastiness. Fairly straight forward coffee stout, but the complexities of the roastiness set it apart.","","Lognar"

3442,"2013-09-23",2.7,"2013: Strangely buttery nose, thats the first smell I get; something like burnt butter or butter melted or cooked in a pan blackened from cooking ground beef... the chocolate / cocoa character in the aroma has a mask of insufferable banana esters and a coating of lactose. Honestly, this is a simple aroma in a simple beer, the only malt play is like generic dark caramel extract syrup... theres no aroma hops and the coffee seems non-existent. Full body with noticeable alcohol (absent in the aroma, which is nice). Not hot or boozy but present. Syrupy (dark caramel malt syrup again), some sort of chocolate and coffee mixture noticeable. Bitterness noticeable in the aftertaste, otherwise muted. Mostly sweet with medium to low acid. While the aroma is mostly garbage I can enjoy the flavor and body enough to not pour it down the drain. But at $12 for a 750ml this will be another one-time purchase from AleSmith. Maybe this was 4.5-5.0 level back in the day, but objectively in 2013 this is a one-dimensional generic coffee stout, and if this is what the brewer(s) think it should smell like then I have to say they are off their rockers.


2003 (big grain of salt here, a 10 year old rating): Draft and bottle, multiple times each. Rating is from draft. Nice robust coffee and milk aroma. Rich, smokey, nutty, woody, and every other word you can think of... incredibly impressive beer. Has a rich fruit and licorice flavor backed up by smokey coffee and cream. I hate to describe it in terms of other beers, but it combines the dark fruit flavors of Expedition Stout with the roasted coffee richness of Old Rasputin.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","3fourths"

The mouthfeel is really thick and oily. The finish is pretty long and bitter with the alcohol warming up. Towards the end of the glass the alcohol starts coming up a bit more in the flavor, cutting off one overall point I almost gave it.

3442,"2013-07-14",2.8,"Seriously the most the overrated beer out there. Let me start by saying I do have a fondness for stouts and everything about this spoke to me - the promises of coffee, chocolate and roasted sensations throughout. Im not adverse to a really dark, rich stout - in fact, I love them. This, however, is a mess. A clumsy combination of overly sweet coffee and poorly masked alcohol made this almost undrinkable after the first glass. I tried so hard to keep an open mind given the great reputation it has but in the end Im just left completely baffled as to why this is held in such high esteem. Even if you happen to like this formula, I have to believe anybody would agree that theres better stouts out there, for half the price too. A bizarre anomaly. 

I gave it a 2.8 because it does look fabulous, it smells rather nice, and it isnt completely horrible - its just a huge let down.","Ohio, USA","chalicemaster"

Bittersweet herbal hops up front mix with smooth, nutty praline. Bitter dark chocolate and dark, bittersweet coffee combine with more praline in a silky smooth mid-palate. Hazelnut, Irish cream and bittersweet coffee come through in a smooth finish, which leaves a lingering warmth. This is a beer as excellent as its reputation suggests, with a level of restraint and subtlety not common in imperial stouts. Its coffee and dark chocolate flavours are nicely unified by the nutty praline flavour that runs through it and gives it weight and line.

Cacao powder, roasted notes, coffee liqour leading to a bit of vinous notes and even a bit of some marzipan sweetness in aroma. Dark and powerful. Later on there appears some notes of salty licorice as well. Oily texture and leaving a nice layer of it on the glass. Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and creamy. Bitter cacao with notes of cherryliqour in taste. Has a gentle warming effect. A bit of coffee beans too with light notes of salty licorice in flavor. Rich and strong. Feels quite sweet at first, but turns into combination of bitter and dark chocolate and freshly roasted coffee beans in finish. This is still one of my favorite imperial stouts, as it seems to be very well balanced and great tasting from time to time with those roasted notes, bitter chocolate, slightly sweet and slightly vinous

Smokey, woodsy malt scent thats smooth, creamy vanilla and bitter fairly acidic coffee and rich nuts too, perhaps floral hops detected.  Low carbonation (average for the style), oily mouthfeel, super clean finish for the style.  Big malt and alcohol flavor.  Creamy at the same time though...difficult to explain.  Strong bitter coffee taste.  Bitterness and acidity flavors toward the end, floral and pine hops probably.  Rich buttery chocolate flavor on finish.

Aroma has tons of coffee, chocolate, toast, caramel, a little toffee, sugared roast nuts, a little earthiness and dry floral notes. Flavor is loaded with coffee right away, like good coffee, lots of sweet caramel, roasted nuts and milk chocolate come in, roast malt, hints of pine and bitter dried citrus, earthy notes, some floral and lightly acidic hop notes that could easily be from the coffee instead of hops and as it warms some dark fruit, sweet bread spice and vanilla notes come out.  Palate is creamy on entry, with a light, to moderate strength, but blanketing carbonation to break it up before an off dry, but still sort of creamy, but oddly crisp and fairly clean finish. They really worked some magic here, somehow having a beer huge in flavor, complexity, body and alcohol content while having a finish as clean and smooth as most stouts half this strength. Still it has a lingering, pleasant sweetness with a little coffee and nuttiness that lasts a good, long time, it just isnt overbearingly roasty, or sweet, or bitter, just delicious, leaving me wanting more. It is definitely on the sweet side, but it carries it well, offering an awesome balance in most categories, despite being a 12% Imperial Stout.

Wow, looks, smells, tastes amazing. Smooth as silk with massive coffee overtones hides its abv well but it's not kidding anyone. A monster of a beer. At $10.99 locally, this is a steal :)

3442,"2012-10-02",4.6,"Wow, finally get a chance to try this one. Have missed out on it on every previous occasion, but this time, I picked up four bottles from SB. Three for aging and one for a completely ordinary Tuesday. Pours pitch black with a thick, large tan (yet with a reddish hue) head that leaves quite a bit of lacing. Aroma is intense. Lots of coffee, heavily roasted malt, chocolate, a bit of licorice, oak wood. Taste is wonderfully complex and rich. Opens a bit sweet, almost with a hint of vanilla, before turning into a long very gently cocoa bitter middle part, before turning towards the sweet side with port tones in the massive finish. And what a finish, it just refuses to let go of your palate - the taste stays with you forever. Very alcohol warming. Low carbonation, full bodied and sort of creamy-oily. One of the best Ive had.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","Ktwse"

Smelled of dark roasted malt, caramel sweetness, bitter chocolate, coffee, vanilla and a light hop presence. Taste was much of the same, but also resembles some dark fruit characteristics, tiny bit of a char.  This was almost a year old bottle so the coffee had started to fad a good bit.

A bit worrisome in strength but the brew is so perfected that it just keeps you from jumping into oblivion. Burned campfire marshmallows. A big dark monster, but well worth it.

A thick beige head sits atop the blackness and leaves ample lacing in its wake. Aromas consist of bitter chocolate, coffee, and roasted malt.

3442,"2012-06-22",4.5,"Rating #1000. As of this time, this is considered the 9th greatest beer in the world by this here website. Im hoping its as good as its reputation suggests. It says its best with a little age on it, but I see no vintage or brewed on date. Pours impenetrable black with a thick dark tan head that recedes slowly, leaving some really decorative lace. The first thing to hit the nose is the roasted malts, followed by the coffee and lots of vanilla. Smells a bit like Whoppers malted milk balls. I also get a hint of leather that Im sure will come out more strongly as it sits; a little dark fruit is hiding in there, too. The taste starts out sweet before becoming quite bitter and lingering that way with a bit of tartness in the finish. The alcohol is noticeable, but it doesnt taste 12%. Licorice comes out as it warms. Velvety mouthfeel. This is realy good, but Ive had better. I wish I had a second bottle to age and I wish I knew when it was brewed. Theres no doubt this will improve with age in a big way.","Coeur d Alene, Idaho, USA","poisoneddwarf"
3442,"2012-06-18",4.3,"Poured from 750ml bottle to tulip glass. Bottled sometime last year. Managed to break the edge off the top of the bottle and drop it into the beer. This will make for a fun scavenger hunt.

Pours about as black as it gets. That said, there is still an edge of slow beading that frames the beer. Big, swelling medium brown head that leaves a boat load of lacing. A beer couldnt look much bigger than this.

Massive nose. Rich dark chocolate notes barely suffocate a toxic bitter coffee. Divine. A dessert beer to end all dessert beers. Tons of rich roasty bits... evolving coffee, dense chocolate, raisin, brown sugar, a bit of booze is buried way beneath all the dessert notes. Yum.

The coffee has definitely taken a bitter turn. What was once fresh and aromatic has turned bitter to compliment a ton of dark chocolate. Nice. Drinking at cellar temp, there is hardly a suggestion of alcohol. Whats there is perfectly incorporated with the coffee and chocolate.

Hardly drinkable but what did you expect? Its about as easy drinking as a 12% imperial coffee stout could be (which, admittedly, isnt saying much).

Have had this one cellared for about a half a year. Poured into a snifter. Not sure the vintage of this as there is no stamp on the bottle. 

Pours a jet black; allows no light to penetrate. Starts off with a huge creamy mocha head on top. Good retention; left some nice lace on the glass. Scents of roasted malts and chocolate. A bit of drying scent in there, not sure what that is specifically. 

Decent body on this beer. A tad crisp, but it still retains some creamy smoothness that I like in this style. Alcohol is pretty well hidden in this beer. Its not noticeable in the flavor at all. Doesnt taste ""hot."" This is a really bland Imp. Stout. Flavors of some mild cocoa, and finishes really charred and burnt. There is no sweet balance in this beer at all.

3442,"2012-03-05",4.2,"Tasted from magnum bottle into tulip glass, thanks ibrew2or3! In every way, a true-to-style and perfectly harmonious Imperial Coffee Stout, which is revered as perhaps the greatest style of all beers. In that sense, Speedway Stout is a near-perfect brew, deserving of its impossibly high ratings. But in another sense, there are a hundred ways to improve upon it by simply accentuating one or more aspects. While drinking it, Joe said, ""drinkable and well-balanced, its like the Bud Light of Imperial Stouts."" I hate to admit it (and I know many raters will hear that as sacrilege) but I see his point. I cant point out a single flaw, but that could be said about the Sam Adams Imperial Stout, too, which is available at every grocery store (I realize of course, that one doesnt contain coffee.) This was nonetheless delicious, I was thrilled to finally try it, and I look forward to the next chance.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"

Aromas of big dark chocolate, coffee, roasted malt, toast, caramel, molasses, biscuit, herbal spiciness, smoke, and earthiness.  Amazing aromas with great balance and strength.  Taste of huge dark roasted chocolate, coffee, black roasted malt, caramel, toast, molasses, biscuit, smoke, earthiness, vanilla, and herbal spice.  Very light amount of spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of big dark chocolate, coffee, dark roasted malt, caramel, vanilla, molasses, and biscuit on the finish for a while.  Medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and thick mouthfeel.  Alcohol is pretty much invisible considering the 12%, with only a faint warming well after the finish present.  Overall this is an absolutely mind blowing imperial stout brewed with coffee.

3442,"2012-03-01",4.0,"From notes.  First reviewed 2/14/2011.  Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a pint glass. 2010 vintage.

In the glass this has a nearly black color with dark walnut edges. A nice creamy brown head rests on top. A big, frothy monster, the head lingers around but does not deliver any lace.

Tons of coffee, dark roasted malt, a little lactose, and pure dark chocolate all coexist in the aroma.

Roasted malt turns to a coffee flavor. Very quickly my mouth becomes overwhelmed with the quality and depth of the flavors. Roasted coffee becomes smooth creamy dark chocolate and espresso. These flavors leave just enough room for a bit of spicy hops to sneak through at the end. The finish is a roasty bitterness with some dark chocolate.

There is no doubt this is a full-bodied imperial stout. Extraordinarily creamy, with medium carbonation. 

This is a smooth, dark chocolate and roast coffee treat.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

AleSmith Finca San Gabriel Bourbon Coffee Speedway
Earlier Rating: 11/6/2010 Total Score: 4.5
Served on tap at OBriens Night of a Million Zillion Speedways 2010. Was able to get two samples. The appearance is the usual Speedway deep black hue with a medium roasty brown head. The aromas are strong with a medium roast medium bodied Central American coffee, very fresh aromas with an oily character to it. Some vanilla and nutty aromas too. The flavors are strong with that medium bodied fresh roasted coffee, essential oils, some light wood flavors a rich fabulous pure coffee flavor. Some nutty flavors and a touch of chocolate too. Very smooth and easy to drink brew, more laid back in intensity and incredibly well balanced.  Again another fantastic brew I hope they continue to make.

AleSmith Dry Hopped Speedway Stout
Appearance 4 Aroma 8 Mouthfeel 4 Flavor 7 Overall 17
Served on tap at OBriens Night of a Million Zillion Speedways 2011. The appearance is the usual Speedway deep black hue with a medium roasty brown head. The aromas are rich roasted malts, bold roast coffee, and wonderful herbal and earthy hops. The flavors start out with the malty, coffee, and dark chocolate that is Speedway with a very nice addition of earthy hops. As the hops grow they taste more herbal and reminiscent of herbal tea. A coffee tea combo is pretty cool. The beer does become a bit astringent. I really liked this one but not sure if the astringent flavors would overpower if you drank even more.","San Diego, California, USA","danielcurtis81"
3442,"2011-11-17",4.7,"One hell of a beer. Pours a viscous black with a lasting tan foam.

Taste is dark, filling, not too bitter, nor too sweet and dominated by coffee notes with some boozy smoothness and a slight hint of oxidation. Yes its rich but as I see it the Speedway Stout sacrifices a bit of complexity in favour of harmony, which is a fair enough tradeoff. Girlfriend says: ""It has a pleasant taste.

3442,"2011-09-23",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 24, 2012 This is one of the most beautiful beers Ive ever seen. Its thick and pitch black with a dark head, like coffe with lots of cream. It reeks of roasted malts and alcohol, with some dark chocolate and coffee, but it isnt as impressive a nose as I was hoping, mainly due to a medicinal touch the alcohol confers to it. Upon taking a sip, however, my opinion changed completely. The taste is SPECTACULAR, with the coffee and dark chocolate notes being much more noticeable and impressive here. Whats more impressive is that it manages to be absolutely drinkable, much more so than other coffee-infused stouts, and yet the coffee is so strong and elegant that you dont have to actively seek it out to know its there. The palate is creamy, elegantly and sufficiently carbonated, and not oily at all. This isnt the most complex stout Ive had, but its definitely one of the tastiest and most balanced. And, as a rule, I love coffee stouts, so Im in love with this.","Texas, USA","AndresTM"

3442,"2011-09-17",4.2,"Rating #631, bottle from Toft Vin Islands Brygge  

Udseende: 4/5 
Til at starte med ikke noget specielt, og skummet former sig næsten helt cola-agtigt indtil man hælder hårdt, hvorefter et pænt og stabilt skum med en ganske acceptabel holdbarhed dog opstår.
Øllen er naturligvis helt brunsort med beige skum som forventet. Der opstår de eftertragtede ""lacings"" når den bliver drukket, hvilket lige hiver øllen op på 4 point i udseende.
 
Duft: 8/10 
Absolut kraftig aroma da øllen kan duftes så snart kapslen er fjernet fra flasken. Især da vi taler om en stout, en øltype hvor duften nogle gange kan være en anelse undertrykt i sammenligning med IPAer eller andre typer med fokus på aromahumlen, er dette bemærkelsesværdigt og et rigtig godt tegn. På 40 centimeters afstand fra glas og flaske former sig ikke de store detaljer af aromaen, men med næsen tættere på glasset afsløres lakrids, til dels noget engelsk lakrids, nybrygget sort kaffe, søde kaffegrums, brændte og ristede malte, lidt flydende chokolade og noget krydret humle.  

Smag: 8/10 
Udover at chokoladen er tydeligere til stede, vil jeg ikke mene at smagen er synderligt overraskende i forhold til duften. Det vil dermed sige at smagen først og fremmest består af en lækker chokoladesmag, lakrids, en anelse af søde kaffegrums, brændte og ristede malte, og en let antydning af træ blandet med nogen alcohol. Kaffenoterne er mig noget utydelige i forhold til hvad jeg havde forventet, og alkoholen bliver lidt for tydelig til min smag. Jeg tør næsten ikke skrive det om sådan et velrennomeret bryg, men alkoholen bringer øllen en smule ud af balance, og den ville have haft godt af en anelse mere sødme. Chokoladen er godt til stede i forvejen, men man kunne måske have leget lidt med noget ekstra kaffesmag og en gang søde chokolademalte til at afbalancere det hele.  

Mundfornemmelse: 5/5 
Utrolig blød og cremet bryg der nærmest føles som silke i munden. Jeg har kun stiftet bekendtskab med én anden øl der slår denne mundfølelse, og det var Mikkellers Beer Geek Weasel.
Jeg fristes nærmest til at sige at den er blødere end silke, men den lidt kradse alkohol trækker i anden retning. Karboneringen er ganske mild, hvilket efter min mening er optimalt for denne øltype.

3442,"2011-05-30",4.4,"Tap at OBriens (Night of a Million Zillion Speedways) during the second annual San Diego Beer Week in November 2010.  This was my second (annual) attempt to go to OBriens to get the Kopi Luwak Speedway.  And just as at the first attempt at the first SDBW in November 2009, I went to OBriens and the line was way out the door.  So I went to Downtown Johnny Browns instead and returned to OBriens on my way home.  Fortunately, there was no line and I got to enjoy several of the rare Speedways that were left (but the Kopi Luwak was finished, of course).  ANYWAY, this pours the usual tarry thick black and has a nice head for a rather small sample.  Aroma is excellent fresh roasted earthy coffee with nuts.  Flavor is sharp roasted coffee, like just cracked open roasted coffee beans.  Also a nice nuttiness, some rich chocolate, and hints of bourbon.  The bittersweet coffee flavor is really standout here...probably my favorite of the five sample Speedways I tried this night.  (5, 568)Earlier Rating: 6/1/2009 Total Score: 4.4Have had this many times in San Diego.  This rating based on a growler fill from brewery.  Pours a thick black tar with no light penetration and a small brown head.  Aroma of roasted coffee and toasty chocolate malt.  Tastes of (quality) coffee and smooth chocolate.  Nice mellow sweetness (hints of chocolate-covered cherries) and theres also a slight note of sourness in the taste.  Full bodied with a lingering coffee taste.

Complex, but all the complexity works as aspects of the main flavours. Coffee flavours are good but not that flash.

3442,"2011-04-08",3.9,"There are so many imperial stouts out there now that generate buzz within the craft beer enthusiasts community its sometimes hard to tell which is which. More often than not, I find these beers to be good or very good instead of excellent or outstanding as their reputations would have me believe. Thats the case with AleSmith Speedway Stout - a very good imperial stout for all the right reasons. But nothing about it makes me consider it among the craft beer elite.I split a 750ml bottle with a friend. Sent to me from StumpyJoeJr in San Diego (Thanks, Ryan!)Appearance: Pitch black, no red or brown around the edges. Poured into a tulip glass I get a tiny bit of head, but it doesnt last. Some spotting lacing. Beer appears very thick in the pour alone.Smell: Not nearly as potent as youd expect. It smells like a standard American imperial stout with noticeable roasted coffee and red wine-like aroma. Perhaps a touch of chocolate. Next to no sheer booze smell, though.Taste: The first few sips are really amazing. Its coffee from start to finish with a touch of bakers chocolate in the aftertaste. Quite roasty as well, giving it a dry, bitter flavor. Bitterness lingers, but only for a short time which makes it not cloying. I was expecting more chocolate, though, as its more of an afterthought (than again, this isnt a chocolate stout). Pretty tasty overall, but not quite as robust as Id prefer. Vinous quality is perhaps a little distracting, but easily tolerable.Mouthfeel: While this beer looked like motor oil in the pour, it was much thinner in the mouth. It didnt quite coat the mouth the way many imperial stouts of the caliber tend to do. Drinkability: Alcohol is virtually non-existent in the taste and feel. I can take big swigs at first, but it eventually becomes a total sipper with an intense, dry, bitter mouthfeel. Ive had other imperial stouts that were more drinker-friendly than this, but Id say this one is still pretty drinkable for a 12% ABV beer.Overall, another great imperial stout, but not one I would consider among the best of the best. Id of course love to try a vintage with a few years on it as I think it would definitely improve with age.NOTE: watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEbRwfYGtw8","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"
3442,"2011-04-05",3.4,"Purchased about 1 month ago; no bottle date.

Slowly develops a 1-finger dark tan head after pouring.  The beer is a very dark brown, near black.

The aroma has some roasty coffee notes, but also a medicinal note and some green wood.  Its not particular appealing, but not off-putting either.

The first sip is an explosion of coffee and chocolate.  Unfortunately, its chased by that same green, medicinal flavor and a bitter woody finish.  The mouthfeel is heavy and coating, but a bit chalky.  Almost no carbonation.

Overall, this is a bit of an enigma to me, though.  Its better than the sum of its parts and I keep being pulled back for another sip.","Portland, Oregon, USA","kscaldef"

3442,"2011-03-31",4.7,"750 ml Bottle. Pours into the glass black as tar with dense chocolate malt head. The aroma is mostly dark roast coffee and chocolate mocha along with roasted malt, vanilla and bourbon. The flavor starts with a jolt of espresso roast coffee and dark chocolate followed by molasses, roast malt, caramel and a subtle alcohol presence in the background that balances it all out. The mouthfeel is slightly syrupy and creamy with soft carbonation and a dry, roasty finish. Theres also a pleasantly mild coffee with a shot of whiskey aftertaste. This is a massive Imperial Stout with just the right balance between the coffee, chocolate and malt flavors.","Seattle, Washington, USA","CampesinoTino"

My sense of smell is overloaded just sniffing this!! HUGE complex aroma of coffee, earthy cocoa, rich molasses, roasted malts, and more coffee! I love a beer that tastes even better than it smells, and this certainly does! Flavors of dark chocolate and roasted coffee on the forefront, followed by smooth malt characters, vanilla, and even more rich coffee flavors. Ive had coffee stouts before, and the coffee sometimes tastes artificial. This tastes like high quality, fresh coffee, but its not so over-powering that it covers up the heavy chocolate malt characters. Ive never tasted such a well-balanced coffee stout. Mouthfeel is thick, yet smooth. I could drink this all day, which at 12% ABV is not a good thing... or maybe it is?

Pours deep, oil black with an average tan head that takes some time to cascade and form, and slowly recedes to fairly thick and even lace.  The overwhelming aroma on the nose is the dark malt with some nuttiness, caramel, milk chocolate, and the coffee has faded significantly, but is still present.  The flavor is sweet up front with tons of caramel and some dried fruit, moving to even more malt with some roast, and once again, lightly bitter coffee.

Smell is of roasted espresso beans and smoky burnt malts. Sweet chocolate syrup is also in there mixed with alcohol. Thats pretty much what dominates the aroma completely. 

Taste is heavy on roasted coffee beans and burnt malts. There is also an aftertaste of bitter coffee grounds, its almost like sipping on a double shot of espresso. Hops could also add to that bitterness Im tasting. Alcohol is definitely present at 12% but not overpowering.

Mouthfeel is medium bodied, nice and syrupy. Carbonation levels are good, well carbonated for such a big, strong beer. Head contributed some creaminess to the body, just not enough to give it a 5

Drinkability is very good. Would have given it a 5 but at 12 percent, it packs a punch. I love Coffee Stouts and it definitely delivers tons of coffee flavor.

Leaves rings of lace that never go away, and a thin cap of fluid foamy head remains on top to the end of the glass. Looks like a cappuccino. Aroma strongly of coffee, dark chocolate, and raw coffee beans, with a tiny bit of booze in the back. Roasted malts are in there too, and the toastiness is inviting. The taste then proceeds to blow everything else out of the water...wow. First sip literally feels like I am sucking on coffee bean. This is an unbelievable mix of coffee with chocolate tones and a smoothness that is all its own. Alcohol is undetectable, and malty sweetness is just about the amount I like to put in my regular coffee - just enough to keep the bitter coffee from being unpleasant. Roasted coffee beans from start to finish make this guy smooth as hell, and the texture of the beer is velvety, with a thick syrupy body that lends itself well to its taste.

As this recedes a touch, the roasted malt and fruit seep in to comprise the finish.  The acetic flavor is quite high in this, almost to the point of vinegar, but it doesnt ruin the beer.

Flavorful, however, not too light, yet not too strong.  Somehow you get the feeling this is the affect the creators of this masterpiece were going for.  Ive never seen a beer foam quiet the way this does, when first poured I thought; where are the bubbles, then after it sat for a few seconds, appeared a nice head, not too overwhelming but just the perfect amount.

If I were to craft a brew this would be just what I would hope to have as and end product.

3442,"2010-12-12",4.5,"750ml bottle, unknown date.  Pours black with a good sized brown head that leaves nice clumpy rings of lacing and holds a small island and ring.  Incredible aroma of premium coffee, chocolate, more coffee, roasted malts, even more coffee, also some anise, dark fruits, and a bit of alcohol.  Great strength.  Flavor features rich coffee, great chocolate notes of dark chocolate, bakers chocolate and milk chocolate.  Roasted malts, anise, dark fruits round things out but the chocolate and coffee are the headliners.  Some alcohol kick, but not boozy or overpowering.  Some bitterness from the malt and coffee along with a touch of sweetness.  Long, lingering coffee & chocolate finish with a touch of heat from the alcohol.  Wonderful.  Mouthfeel is very rich, creamy and velvety, not the thickest Imperial Stout Ive had but still very full bodied, low carbonation.  Possibly the perfect mouthfeel for the style, thick, but not too thick, so creamy and smooth without over active carbonation getting in the way.Oh.  My.  God.

S: Lots of espresso mixed with very dark malt and some hints of dark chocolate.

The head is even very big, and sticks nice to the glass. Medium dark brown coloured, and holds pretty good. Smell is coffee, but with a bit of something unpleasant inside. Roastiness, coffee, some chocolate and hops, and something that goes slightly sour (not overwhelming, but its there slightly). Taste is roasted coffee, an oily body, but less then expected.

Pours deep brown (almost jet black) with a thick and frothy and sticky dark tan head. The legs in this beer is amazing as is the sticky lacing on the glass. The carbonation is PERFECT. Equally amazing like Boulevard Bourbon Barrel Quad. The nose is dark chocolate, roasted coffee, nutella, mild hops, roasted barley, licorice, and raisin. The taste is slightly bitter at first with dark chocolate, roasted malt, raisin, and amazing French coffee. This is followed by more chocolate, more malt, earthy hops, and licorice.

Goose Island BCS is better but not by much. Amazing beer.","Washington, USA","waltersrj"

3442,"2010-08-01",4.8,"This is the type of stout that will make a stout lover squeal with delight  like a little girl at a Hannah Montana concert. The pour is a thick black consistent with overused motor oil. Regardless of how you pour this beer, you are going to get at least a medium sized, dark gray head. The head on this beer is so impressively dark and forceful in its presence. The aroma has a heavy coffee presence that is very apparent in the taste of the beer. The palate is a glorious combination of coffee and dark, dark chocolate. As you drink this extremely heavy beer, you realize that if you drink very much, you will not only be hammered, but extremely full as well. This is probably the most filling beer I have ever consumed.  The only thing left to say is thank you AleSmith for this magnificent brew.","Devola/Marietta, Ohio, USA","JStax"

Poured a dark brown to black with a one-finger black head that settled into a spotty large-bubbled coating. Lacing is pretty heavy and lasting. Nose is coffee, vanilla, roasted malt and bourbon. Taste is roasted coffee, chocolate and bourbon up front, with notes of vanilla and dark fruit. Finish is both dry and sweet. Mouthfeel is medium to thick, creamy with good carbonation. Not much that would give away the ABV. Its not difficult to understand why this is universally considered a great coffee stout and I would love another!","Havertown, Pennsylvania, USA","regspeir"

3442,"2010-07-27",4.7,"Bottle, Dont really remember who traded me this anymore, but who cares. Scrizzz or TheCheeseMan. 09 bottle I think. Atleast Ive had it since summer 09. Pours black obviously, with a thick brown milkshake looking bubbly head. Aroma is mellow when just poured. Milk chocolate, coffee, some slightly sour burnt notes. Some oxidation is starting to take effect. A touch of prunes. No detectable alcohol. So SO creamy in the mouth. On the wikipedia page for perfect_mouthfeel they should show a picture of this brew. No disambiguation. I wish I never gave any other brew a 5 for Palate before except perhaps DH1. Loads of sweetness here, but the coffee bitterness and burnt sourness balances it out well. Some liquorice. Just a hint of alcohol. Overall, this is very well crafted. Very balanced in every aspect. Theres really nothing missing, except for I guess a surprising twist in the aroma/flavour department. Something that would make this brew blow me away completely. Maybe Im asking too much from a beer. This is balance exemplified, and in a massive brew at that. Screw it, Im gonna give it less than a 5 and hope that some day, something will be like this, only with that wow-factor.","Årnes, NORWAY","Kestral"

3442,"2010-07-02",4.0,"Nose is roasted coffee, milk/cream, chcoloate, not much alcohol, but more alcohol as it warms.  The appearance is true to style, an attractive deep black, light brown head.  The flavor is awesome, coffee, chocolate, sweet cream, fruit like plums.  Nice thick body, smooth, creamy mouthfeel.  The finish is roasty, moderate resiny hops, leaves the mouth a little dry, maybe the alcohol.  Alcohol in this guy is barely noticeable, given the high ABV, but comes out a little as the beer warms.  Very good overall, but it has not lived up to its hype (not an easy thing to do I suppose).  Important note:  letting this beer warm up to just under room temperature improves the enjoyment of this beer considerably.","Bellmore, New York, USA","tgncc"
3442,"2010-06-30",4.0,"Visual: Black and opaque like espresso, quarter inch head that coats the walls of the glass and remains until the beer is gone. Smell: Quite a nose on this one. Burnt sugar/molasses in the forefront, undertones of dark roasted coffee. A bit of alcohol in there as well. Reminds me ever so slightly of dark, aged rum. Taste: Coffee and dark chocolate come through pretty strongly in the flavor, like an alcoholic mocha. Molasses and just a touch of hops give it a lingering, bitter finish that lasts until the next sip. This is surprisingly smooth and sweet for such a robust beer. It looks intimidating, but its actually pretty drinkable. Mouth: To call this full-bodied is an understatement. Thick and syrupy, minimal carbonation. It coats the mouth in the way that only an imperial stout can. Drinkability: Good for the style, but its still so heavy that a glass or two should be enough for most people.","California, USA","largadeer"

The alcohol is rather perceivable. Has a huge full body, you could eat it with a teaspoon, and a rich silky balanced flavour, a mix of coffee, bitter chocolate, with some occasional ripe cherry and prune notes and a certain balancing sourness.

The look is close to opague black aswell with a creamy dark brown head. Perfect. Aroma is just intensly full of roasted coffee notes along with cocoa.

3442,"2010-06-13",3.6,"Bottle split among friends in snifters produced a small tan head that settled to a thin lace. The head easily could be brought back with a swirl of the glass. The body of the brew was the typical black stout color.

The first thing I noticed was tha lack of coffee aroma coming from the brew seeing the way they pushed it on the lable I expected something a little more robust. It did have a good chocolate smell and when it warmed got to room temp the coffee was a bit more present. On the flavor the sme thing happened I got some great roast but more bitter chocolate than coffee. The mouthfeel was good and thick with ample carbonation.

It drank well for a stout I wasnt really wanting for more. Maybe it was Hype meeting reality that thru me on this one I am glad I tried it but knowing the price point on this brew. Most likely one and done for me, but having said that I would like to see the difference on tap, and being barrel age brings.","Skowhegan, Maine, USA","Pastor"

A- Huge dark tan foamy head that is 2-3 . This fades eventually to 1/2 finger and has good retention from there. Body is big, viscous, opaque, and black.

S-This brew smells really hot w/ alcohol. A big roasted malt/coffee presence is also noticeable and dominant. Behind all this are characteristics typical for an IRS such as dark fruit, licorice, dark chocolate, plum, and anise. Nose is pretty complex.

T- Flavor is HUGE and filled with roasted malt, and coffee flavors upfront, and, as with the nose, a lot of IRS characteristics going on like dark fruit, anise, and dark chocolate. The ABV is pretty hot and does not really even attempt to hide itself. It offers a slight bitterness and a big alcohol heat at the end.

P-Medium carbonation, thick viscous body, slightly smooth and creamy but has an alcohol astringency component as well.

O-This is a big,really intense, high octane stout that is full of flavor, complexity, and a lot of booze. Overall-a really good, well put together brew by one of my favorite breweries-Alesmith.

Very slick/creamy, oily mouthfeel that leaves a slight coating on the palate.  Ultra fine carbonation with a medium body.

3442,"2010-01-18",5.0,"UPDATED: SEP 7, 2010 Oh boy.  This was my first rating ever and it was in severe need of updating.  Man, I was a n00b.  Well, the truth is I can kinda remember what it tasted like when I had it way back when, but the reason Im updating this is because I just had a aged bottle, and to me, it just wasnt as good.  I was kinda let down, but in truth, I liked it better pre-aged.  That deserved a 5/5.  But after 10 months of aging, something went awry.   All the coffee notes disappeared, and the brew as a whole tasted a bit like bourbon.  The chocolate notes tasted burnt, and it just wasnt as magical an experience as I had hoped.  That being said, I am leaving my rating at a 5/5 because when I had that bad boy on tap @ the brewery in Nov 09, it blew my tiny mind wide open and I have been looking for something equally as good ever since, since it isnt available where I live.  Fantastic beer with everything right, so long as you like imperial stouts, and the flavors of coffee and chocolate.  Otherwise its not your beer.

3442,"2009-12-17",4.5,"At last some Speedway has found its way into my glass. While enjoying this stout I realized I wasnt really blown away by any one thing, and soon understood that what makes this great is simply how well its made. Opaque dark, rich brown body with a diminishing medium brown head and streaky/spotty lacing. Coffee and chocolate aromas dominated by burnt, roasted malts. Exceptional feeling from this beer, drinkable and approachable. Very smooth with a nice dry finish. Flavors mirror the robust aromas. Standard Imperial Stout qualities with an over abundance of quality coffee.","North Canton, Ohio, USA","cking"
3442,"2009-12-14",4.3,"UPDATED: OCT 18, 2010 Sampled this standing out in the cold at the ORF release thanks to kp.  It was more like smelling my morning coffee than a pungent 12% imperial stout.  Poured pitch black with little head.  Aroma had mostly coffee with a small amount of the dark chocolate malt.  Taste was overpoweringly coffee to the point that my palate was shot for the day.  Couldnt taste anything but coffee for the next hour.  Definitely complex and nice to drink if thats all youre going to be drinking for the day.  Too in-your-face for me.  Would have like a bit more drinkability instead of one sided coffee. 3.8

Re-rated from my own full bottle.  Had this fresh out in California and my opinion couldnt have changed more!  much more balanced with the coffee, chocolate, roasty malts.  Much smoother on the palate and enjoyable.  Great improvement","Charlotte, North Carolina, USA","SpencerDB"

Aroma is roasty and toasty coffee, and dark chocolate with some caramel-molasses sweetness. Also has a doughy quality and even some hints of pit fruit and vanilla. Full bodied, very thick and creamy mouthfeel. Flavor is coffee, roasted malts, caramel and resiny hops which linger on the bitter finish. The big alcohol is cleverly concealed. Im not giving this my highest rating, but its certainly a top-notch concoction. I will see how this develops as I empty the bottle. I imagine the barrel aged version would be amazing.","Portland, Oregon, USA","cmonster"

Nose is definitely a JAVA blast, but I also picked up sweet fruits (like dark cherries or maybe plum).  Flavor is dark roast dominated, with the uber coffee tone.  As it warms to proper temp, I pick up faint vanilla and brown sugar hints.  But this is definitely a coffee bomb.  The malts are bitter, but not astringent.  The alcohol is noticeable, but only slightly so.  Mouthfeel is full bodied with a nice dry finish.  The finish lingers... and here you can pick up some of the more subtle characteristics.

Smell is surprisingly subdued, but primarily a nice, potent black coffee.  Also contains touches of booze and butterscotch (Im admitted stuffy today, but thats what I smelled).  Pours a thick pitch black liquid capped by a thin bubbly dark tan head that just barely clings to the glass.

Flavor is potent with the Ryan Brothers coffee and warmth from the high ABV.  Fades through to a nice tart fruit flavor and ends just a bit sweet and smoky.  Incredibly creamy and smooth mouthfeel, and very drinkable for such a big beer.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","bblack99"

S - Milk chocolate, coffee/espresso, and a small hint of the 12% ABV but not too much. 

T - Chocolate covered coffee beans with some alcohol on the finish. I imagine the alcohol would appear less as this bottle ages but really dont mind it. 

M- Medium bodied, rich and thick with some slight carbonation, very nice but I would prefer a fuller bodied.

Not overly complex, but it doesnt change its quality. Very slight alcohol noted here, somewhat more in the finish, but at this ABV it should be felt more. Dangerously drinkable, yet full bodied with oily palate. Long and pleasant finish, bittersweet, again with that amazing coffee.

Its powdery and smooth in the mouth, with a medium-full body. Really well-balanced and easy to drink, and only a little alcohol burn--amazing for a 12% brew. Pretty impressive stuff.","Middleton, Wisconsin, USA","madvike"
3442,"2009-11-04",4.4,"Pitch black, decent viscosity and a medium sized pale brown head that settles rather slowly actually and leaves espresso-like lacings.

The smell is amazing. Rich, powerful and very balanced. Big coffee notes of espresso and freshly ground hard roasted coffee beans. Hints of soy sauce, salt licorice and dark fruits. Delightful notes of dark chocolate. Just a hint of tannins and slightly acidic roasty aromas. This is really impressive.

The taste is dominated through and trough by rich coffee flavors. Freshly ground coffee beans and espresso blend with wonderful flavors of dark chocolate and some nutty aromas. Notes of dark fruits. The sweetness is restrained in favor of bitter roasted flavors. The malty backbone is present, but hard to detect beneath all the coffee flavors. In the middle, the roasted character is accentuated further towards a taste of almost burnt coffee and malts. At this point, the beer actually gets a little too much and doesnt manage to keep everything together. But this is just a minor slip, and hardly of importance for the overall impression. Further, i notice a nice hop flavor that works really well with the coffee character. Notes of wood and fresh earth. The finish has a real coffee- and hop bitterness to it with notes of soy sauce, salt licorice and vanilla. Long lasting coffee notes lingers in the mouth. The alcohol is almost completely absent except for a pleasant warming sensation. This is just oh so tasty.

Very smooth but it still manages to leave a nice sticky sensation in the mouth. The body is not as big as I had expected, but I think this suits the beer well.

This is just a fantastic beer. Great flavors, big complexity and very balanced. Its really nice to come by a beer that manages to hold such bold and rich flavors together as this one does. And as this wasnt enough, its really really easy to drink, I went through a bottle way to quickly.

TEMP: Cellared @ approx 50 degrees 

This pours the expected jet black color.  An easy pour produces a four-finger head of creamy, dense, dark brown colored foam.  Retention is great.  Lacing is thick and very sticky.

Huge nose, full of roasted malt notes.  Loads of milk chocolate notes and traces of some dark chocolates in there, as well.  Mild notes of dark coffee presence.  Brown sugar sweetness and hints of toasted caramels.  A very light touch of booze is detected, but not nearly the amount that one would expect far 12.00%abv beer.

Big notes of roasted malts.  Lots of dark roasted coffee flavors, along with some dark chocolate notes that Id say are somewhere in the 80% to 90% range.  Very dark and with a slight touch of bitterness.  Nice touches of toffee and caramels and a hint of brown sugar give this a mild sweetness that balances the dark roastiness out quite nicely.  The finish, while on the dry side, is long and delicious.

This one is very full-bodied, almost qualifying as thick.  Carbonation level is on the high-end of medium.  This provides a great level of creaminess but, unfortunately, retains a slight roughness around the edges.  If they smoothed it out just a touch more, it could be perfect.

The booze, which made a minor apearance in the nose, is nowhere else to be found in this beer.  That, combined with the great flavor, make this a very tasty and drinkable beer.

3442,"2009-10-12",4.7,"750 ml bottle.  Pours blacker than a thousand midnights.  Like a black hole devouring all light that attempts to pass through.  A thin, small but creamy head forms slowly.  At the onset the aroma is so obviously coffee, but then it begins to divide itself into many different coffees.  Dark roast, espresso, even  mild.  Hints of chocolate?  Can the taste ever live up to its bouquet?  As I slowly tip the glass Im at first leery, and fearful of disappointment.  But then Im taken away and actually get chills across my shoulders and back.  All the complexity and wonderful diversity of the aroma is maintained  no  surpassed as I get near giddy at the sheer joy of the experience.  All the while, that wonderful coffee presence at its core.  Soft carbonation, a bit sticky, it leaves me smacking and licking my lips wanting to make sure that I dont miss a single opportunity for pleasure.  I bought this about a month ago, and it states right on the bottle that its best if aged 6 to 24 months.  Bottled on 8/4/2009 would have meant Id have to wait until around March of 2010!

A lot of coffee on the tongue and a hint of vanilla, too.  But here is the catch: at 12 percent, the alcohol in this beer is too much.  It intrudes on the aromas and the flavors, and the palate is slick and hot.  Sure, the taste of the beer is great, but with this much alcohol, the whole experience slips away on the finish.

3442,"2009-09-16",4.0,"Excuse the personal narrative here, but Ive drunk a lot more beer than Ive rated, and I am beginning to wear out on RIS. This is the beer that finally did it for me. Its an excellent beer, but its finally too much. Too much malt, too much alcohol. 
On to the beer at hand. 
Lots of coffee, chocolate, roasted malts, sticky mouthfeel, the usual assortment of RIS adjectives. I wasnt blown away, but its very good. Add it to the list of RIS Id rather have than Dark Lord.","California, USA","tekhna"
3442,"2009-09-13",4.0,"8 month old bottle poured for my dads 50th birthday.  Pours black with milky-chocolate head that lasts a while.  Aromas of chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, alcohol, sweet apricots, and hot chocolate milk are present.  Flavor is sweet, acrid, bitter, coffee, some roast - not nearly as complex as I imagined it would be.  Mouthfeel is coating and thick.  Overall, good, but not the level that of excellence I expected from a top 10 beer.  Perhaps Ill just have to try another bottle...","Ohio, USA","TearsforBeers"
3442,"2009-09-13",4.4,"Thick and rich in appearance.  Almost black.  A bit thick rippled dark tan head that just does not go away.  Aroma is huge coffee and chocolate with a big dose of hops.  Flavor is very much the same as the nose.  Dark fruit.  Mid bottle the huge beginning zing fades leaving a very smooth stout with cocoa leading the way.  The alcohol is not really tasted but is evident in warming and head spinning.  This is a wonderful beer that starts out with powerful flavors that smooth out as a top tier impy stout.  So well done!","Wood River, Illinois, USA","Strykzone"

Aroma hits the nose with deep dark roasted molasses, with chocolate and coffee coming through strong as well.  Touch of earthiness and dark fruit (raisin).  As it warms, much more deep dark chocolate comes out.  Very full-bodied, only a touch of sweetness.  Then, a pleasantly bitter coffee comes bursting through.  This fantastic espresso mocha finish stays long on the tongue and makes me want more.  Very drinkable imperial stout.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","cprochak"

Pours pitch black and thick, like motor oil, with a nice brown head and decent retention for such a high abv brew.  The aroma is big and roasty with coffee as well as molasses.  Going down its creamy, semi-sticky sweet, but little in the way of an alcohol sting, and moderate bitterness rounding it off.  Flavors show vanilla, molasses, dashes of chocolate, with the obvious big hefty coffee roast.  Full-bodied for sure.  Not too hard to drink for a 12% Imperial Stout, though.  There are other Imperial Stouts I like more than this one but clearly this is very well made and overall quite good.","Lake Mary, Florida, USA","changeup45"

I cant begin to tell you. Not as pungent as I thought it would be. Not much of a sweet aroma either, but there is a subtle chocolate-malt sweetness in the background. Coffee is what stands out the most to me. I cant believe how fresh that coffee taste is. Heavy coffee roast flavor that is really good. Best thing about the beer is the flavor. Slight alcohol burn, but nothing substantial. Subtle chocolate flavor comes through. Finally, I get to try the Speedway.

Pours a licorice/espresso/spent motor oil body. While 1st pour has only a thin wispy head 2nd pour yields big and bountiful pumpernickel/banana nut bread colored head. Impressive.

Mild yet abundant scent of coffee beans backed by caramel/cinnamon sugar malt and oily alcohol. Smells nicely ominous.

Wow. Lots and lots of coffee-Italian roast or darker. Loads of malt and piney piney hops. Warmth brings out more cinnamon sugar and molasses. $#!+ dog!

Held up to the light, it remains equally black, light does not penetrate this beer. Nose is milk chocolate, coffee of many shades, fruit, a certain vinous character. Not as complex as say Struise Black Albert, but huge and immensely pleasing. The palate is so much better than the nose, good as it was. Coffee beans, milk chocolate, espresso, malt, roast, mouthcoating, very well-ntegrated hops. This beer transistions from swet to bitter, then sweet and bitter.

Aroma is heavy with flowery hops, vinous red grape essence, roasts, and creamy coffee.  Flavor starts with definite hoppiness, then moving dramatically towards coffee and cream crossed with a fine red wine.  Sounds weird, but these flavors move harmoniously together, intensifying as the beer warms.  Once you let this baby sit, this beer has more flavor than you can shake a finger at.  Very, very satisfying.  A rich palate, perfect carbonation, and a smooth finish cap it off.  Lastly, this tasted great, but young.

Extremely opaque dark brown with zero light penetration the thick dark brown cap that sits on top had phenomenal staying power. Aroma was very nice it was a good balance of coffee and chocolate with the chocolate coming out stronger, alcohol was noticeable but barely along with some Christmas style spices. Where is the 12% you can hardly notice it maybe all this delicious coffee and chocolate are hiding it in the taste. There is for sure a burnt quality to the flavor and a very weak raspberry taste, the after taste was short lived and mildly bitter.

3442,"2009-05-26",4.7,"WTF!!!!!!!! stuff is absolutely F**K*D!!!! Theres sediment!!! Ill sell my children for more!!! oh, wait, I have 2 more bottles...and I live in Edmonton where nooo one can get this!!! Wheres the alcohol?? Its 12% and you cant tell. The sediment(lots)at the bottom of our glasses is STUCK to the bottom and is orange. Put a pint with its MAAAASIVE thick dark brown head up to a bright pot light and there is zero light penetration. Speedway is a black hole of colour. 12% and easy drinking? That should be impossible. Incredibly black with unmistakable expressso flavor and a nice bitter after tast and Im almost pissed cause were drinking it like water (sacreledge**). Stuff is soft like Downey or that kreepy Sunny-D crap. Intense malt flavour. Burp was pleasant with warming guttral heat. Brad says 2 minuits after a sip that its very bitter and he orgasms...me too at the thought. Read the bottle - its dead on; except that if you have a sun tan, youll lose it as the beer sucks the pigment right off out of your skin.

update: Jan 08: 2.5+ yr cellared bottle bought in Jan 2005, AR: choc, slight hops, strong coffee early on but the chocolate takes over. T: The hops become more obvious in the flavor, coffee, chocolate, dirt and earthy, pine. Notable alcohol burn. It definetly softened. Better when fresh. Gave it a 9 9 9 9 9 for a 4.5 but I wont change the original since this was aged.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

3442,"2009-05-15",3.8,"UPDATED: NOV 22, 2009 Pours a liquidy dark brown with a medium brown head that rises, then falls in short order. Aroma is boldly of sweet coffee at first, then premium dark chocolate and roasted malts, and roasted chestnuts. Flavor initially has metallic overtones. Chocolate and coffee again come smoothly in the flavor, with a cherry liqueur finish. There is some chemical taste near the end a la witch hazel. Mouthfeel has good carbonation, but I was really hoping for thicker viscosity. I mean, it came off a lot thinner than Id expected for a purported world-class impy. The 12% isnt that noticeable until it hits your esophagus, so its pretty smooth in that regard. I was hoping for something more epic for the #5 beer in the world (as of the time I write this), but hey, damn good nevertheless, and very affordable and accessible for that matter. Overall, very good to excellent.
********RERATE, 11/22/09*****: Okay, my original rating is affirmed. A very good tasting stout, but again, a disappointingly thin body, and the flavor profile isnt as complex as one would hope for from a Top 50 beer. Tasty dark chocolate, coffee, and burnt malt in the flavor, but nothing really stands out to make this a world class impy as purported. Again very good, even delicious, just not Top 50 material by any means....","California, USA","Gypsy19"

Aroma of coffee, butter, vegetables, faint chocolate and yeast.  Flavor follows, a bit cooked, faded coffee and mellow chocolate, buttery, lots of roast, very smooth and balanced, slightly boozy.   Not an extreme beer like many of its peers, really well balanced.  Not sweet or bitter but just right.  Medium/full body, creamy, smooth, faint carbonation, not sticky or chewy.

This time though I picked up a complex and unique aroma of roasted coffee with a tinge of vanilla. The flavor was vanilla first with the roasted malt flavor coming through a little later in the palate.  The roasted malt at first was like a coffee experience but soon that faded, possibly as it warmed, into a more chocolate malt and cocoa flavor. All of this combined with a creamy milky sort of texture reminds you of a chocolate milk sort of experience. Ridiculous, ridiculous sort of beer.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","jrob21"

3442,"2009-03-21",4.8,"UPDATED: AUG 26, 2011 Ive had this a few times in the past, figured I pick one up again and rate it. Pours jet black with a dark and oily tan head. Very strong coffee aroma, but some sweet chocolate as well to make a nice mocha scent. Initial thought is that the flavor is more tart/sour than I remember. The coffee flavor is the most prominent, it is complemented by bittersweet chocolate, green raisins, and a little vanilla. The body is a not a thick as the pour suggests, but is very smooth, also somewhat oily. This is a very good beer, yet not as good as I remembered. It makes me wonder how long it aged on the shelves before I bought it or if my memory just failed me.  

UPDATED 8/26/11: Wanted to give this one another try in case previous tasting was a bad bottle. Turns out that it was, this beer is as good as I originally remembered it. Silky smooth yet full bodied, huge coffee and chocolate flavor, the aftertaste fools your mouth into thinking it just ate a bunch of chocolate covered coffee beans.

Pour was thinner than I expected, very dark brown with a tall dark brown head that settles down to a nice creamy layer after about a minute. Very rich aroma of roasted chocolate and coffee malts, raisins and a lot of booze. Despite the alcoholic aroma, I found the 12% very well hidden. It has a surprisingly tart flavor with an oily, salty finish. I tasted notes of chocolate, coffee, raisins, and lemon. Very smooth on the palate and a tad thinner than some of the other Imperial stouts. I personally like the thicker, richer chocolatey, dark fruity versions of this style.

Poured kind of cold into my New Belgium snifter.
No apparent head. Just a small ring of foam around the perimeter of the glass.
Smell was of chocolate , coffee. I sat enjoying the aroma until the beer warmed up to a suitable temperature, i.e. it didnt give my fingers frostbite.
Taste: Strong coffee taste, lots of roastiness.
Kind of sweet. It tastes just like an iced coffee that you would get at Starbucks.
As the beer warms theres more complexity coming out. I get some dried fruit, fig, raisins, etc. No alcohol burn 12% you say? Hah!
Mouthfeel: spot on for a stout. Not as thick as one would expect, despite there being quite a bit of sludge at the bottom of the bottle.
Drinkability: Yes it is. Very drinkable. I would be able to put a bottle of this away by myself, although it would take an entire evening.

S- As billed, the aroma is big on coffee, toasty, and roasty, as well as a good offering of chocolate, molasses, and toffee, some dark rich malts in there as well and a subtle alcohol presence
T- Initial taste is dominated by a huge coffee taste backed by dark chocolate, I am also catching some molasses and dark fruits in there as well as a hint of vanilla and slight hop character, finishes with that hop bitterness and a warming alcohol presence
M- Very full-bodied stout that is thick and creamy on the palate, bordering on syrupy, carbonation is lively and balanced
D- The alcohol presence is surprisingly subtle for a whopping 12%abv, but I still wouldnt push my luck with this one, this big stout is well-known and respected throughout the land and I cast my review in the midst of the majority: a top quality coffee-forward Imperial Stout that is in the top tier of the genre (along with Old Rasputin and Stone IRS)Earlier Rating: 8/18/2008 Total Score: 4.3On cask at the Real Ale Festival at PP Carlsbad. Appearance is dark brown hue, thin ring of tan creamy foam, minimal lacing. Smell is huge coffee malts, plenty of roast-toast, chocolate, grassy hops, light booze. Taste is hit strong by pure coffee grounds, quickly transitions to roast and chocolate cocoa, tinges of grassy bitter hops, finishes with coffee bitterness. Medium-bodied, creamy thick texture, mild carbonation. Coffee is super strong and abv is well-masked but lurking in the background, this one is up there with Founder’s breakfast stout for the most flavorful coffee stouts I’ve tasted, I sure hope to see this in bottle form sometime in the future.","San Diego, California, USA","BrotherGrendel"

The texture and flavors of the beer coat your palate and dont let go. Oily, and dense as the alcohol and hops initially bits your tongue, next the dark roast  flavors sooth you mouth and make you want to drink this all night.

Bottle aged for about a year. Smells like super malty grains and coffee. the flavor is strong coffee and molasses, then a heavy maltiness. This is actually pretty delicious and the mouthfeel is nice.

The finish is fantastic as well - the flavor trails off into a very nice bitter coffee bitterness, with a hint of boozy warmth from the 12%.

Mouthfeel was a bit off for me, odd tingly carbonation, unusually clean for an impy, not at all rich and creamy, even when I tried to swirl out the carbonation that was throwing me off. All that vinousness reveals this beer to me as unquestionably worthy, but I cant say I was nearly as impressed as a 4.35 would suggest. Rerate, bottle. Very different mouthfeel this time, low carbonation, but instead overly muddy; this may be the first time Ive really gotten a ""motor oil"" feel from an impy. Still has some nice coffee and chocolate notes, but not as clean as many in the style.","Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","fredandboboflo"

Quite enjoyable, although not the best of its style, in my opinion.

I have no reason to believe that it is a bad bottle, so Im not sure why my opinion of this beer has changed so drastically, but I am going to recount it anyway!  Aroma is decent--roasted malt and light coffee bean notes.  Flavor is super sweet, medicinally sweet, with no real complexity.  No coffee in the flavor.  Hard to drink too.

Pours an oily jet black having a dark brown frothy head that stays for a while. Awesome complex strong aroma of coffee, chocolate, caramel, hops, and roasted malts. Now for the taste. Texture is pretty smooth. Now this obviously is one of those beers you sip to truly appreciate the taste so if you take a big gulp you taste alcohol but when sipped.....Many of the aromas come into the flavor so what you have is this taste sensation of chocolate, coffee, burnt malts, hops, touch of vanilla, caramel, and roasted malts. Should be drank at the temp it was designed for like around 50 deg or the flavors don’t come out as well. Truly a complex and close to perfect well rounded Imperial stout. This might be my favorite Imperial stout. For the money I paid for this it was well worth it. I may just buy a couple more and age them for a year just to see how much smoother the taste will get. Nice appropriate bitter finish that leaves a burnt flavor on the taste buds.

Black with a rich, bubbly tan head. Nose is strong, rich, high-quality coffee... actually, more like a high-quality coffee shop. Also has some minor milk chocolate and alcohol in there. Flavor has more coffee and chocolate, a little alcohol. Never too bitter, this has a rich body thats ultra-smooth and ideal for such a coffee beast.

3442,"2008-07-05",4.2,"UPDATED: JUN 8, 2012 Finally, after so long a wait I have tried the Speedway. Thanks footbalm. Pours a dark black body with a thin beige head. The aroma is mostly rich coffee notes. The taste was very good; heaps of mocha ice coffee, some Oak, chocolate, and a very smooth and full mouthfeel. Very good. No notice of the 12% ABV at all. I could drink this for breakfast. Re-rate: this beer is so damn good, viscous, oil, dark fruit, yes huge milky coffee. Much more than a coffee forward brew. Damn good.","Portland, Oregon, USA","douglas88"

It tasted like coffee whipped cream as I sucked it down.  I cant imagine a better brew than this, but Im keeping 0.2 just in case (like the olympic judges).  Flavor was the fullest Ive tasted with parts of chocolate, coffee, toffee, and dark fruit.  Some of the alcohol became apparent as it warmed, but very slightly.

First sip:  is rich, creamy, and complex with a great balance with all that is going on.  Coffee dominates as the lead, with everything else performing great in a supportive role. Not as thick or syrupy as a Dark Lord, but the body is strong thanks to a great malt backbone.  It finishes with a wonderful bitterness that is much appreciated.

3442,"2008-06-15",4.7,"UPDATED: NOV 24, 2009 For Alesmith Double Coffee Speedway Stout: Multiple samplers at the Real Ale Festival VIP Session at Pizza Port Carlsbad on 6/13. Another big standout of the tasting! Pitch black, crude oil appearance with minimal carbonation and no head. Serving this one from the cask beer engine just made it that much tastier. Robust coffee grounds and espresso aroma, but still maintains the well-balanced roasted malt and vanilla profile of Speedway. Serious amounts of rich black chocolate and amazing earthy coffee notes with burnt wood and some tobacco. Bitterness is more pronounced and prolonged with twice the coffee. Surprisingly drinkable with a thick, cheek-biting body. While I would still prefer regular Speedway, this is great!Earlier Rating: 3/19/2007 Total Score: 4.7Ive tried this fantastic beverage many more times than I can count, and I can say that every batch on tap is noticeably different. I could not find many things that would depreciate the rating of this beer when I had 2 goblets of this stuff at Liars Club (Mission Beach) one time. A massive brown head, and incredibly smooth. The only way to really appreciate this beer is on tap, or in a true vintage bottle. One of the best ratings Ive done yet. I must say that the vintage bottle (04) I shared with jarspag is what really kept my ratings high on this one. There is a huge variability between aged bottles and taps at different locations. Based on the vintage tasting, I think this is one stellar brew that mellows with age incredibly well. Thick and smooth, with a well-balanced hop profile and loads of coffee, molasses, figs and licorice. Extremely chewy malt character with dark chocolate notes and coffee bean lingering forever. One of my all-time favorite beers from the Smithy...from any brewery for that matter. Always available here in my stomping grounds of SD. This epitomizes the character of a near-perfect imperial stout for me. Great!","Carlsbad, California, USA","hapjydeuce"
3442,"2008-06-15",4.4,"I am from SD and live close to the brewer.   I love this beer but find a nuanced defect in the finish.   I may imagine this but I taste a bit of grittiness perhaps due to the coffee grounds. 

What else is there to say: A big high ABV rich smokey stout with a great head.  Viva Alesmith!

3442,"2008-06-01",4.4,"Shared w/ Juart.  Pours black with a thick frothy head... Id say about 3 fingers.  Doesnt really lace as much as there is a solid adhesion of head the whole way down to the beer even after the center dissipates.  The aroma is a malty carbonic burnt coffee with really bitter chocolate, black cherry, mahogany, and a noticeable alcohol.  The flavor has a strong fruity character up front, almost sour, but then dissolves into a strong roasted bitter.  Definitely some chocolate and even a touch of caramel.  A little vanilla comes through before the bitter hits.  The body is questionable as it is a little light, but it makes it more balanced and drinkable than most Impy Stouts.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","Naka"
3442,"2008-05-29",4.4,"Appearance: Pours a dark brown, near black body with, well, no real head to speak of. Rather Kahlua-like in appearance.

Smell: Heavily roasted dark malts with notes of espresso, dark chocolate, molasses, and chocolate cake (topped with a cherry). Keyword: Lovely.

Taste: Dark, roasty maltiness with full flavors of dark chocolate, birthday cake coated in blackstrap molasses, and (even moreso) robust coffee. Slightly obscured fruitiness. Roasty, earthy bitterness. A flickering of sweet dark caramel in amongst the heavier flavors. A distinct, warming touch of alcohol heat. Long, lingering coffee finish.

Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium carbonation. Relatively creamy mouthfeel.

Nose is roast and fruit, chocolate covered raisins, coffee, slight caramel and some alcohol.  Taste is fruity up front that leads somehow to a sour taste (lactose maybe?) however mild.  This melds well into a slightly burnt, roasty coffee flavor.  A solid bitter from the hops mixes well with mild astringency from the roasted malts.  Great balance.  I think thats what makes it so good, and so highly rated.  Its not roast/fruit/bitter heavy like some other Impy Stouts.  Very good stuff.","Indiana, Pennsylvania, USA","dpjuart"

3442,"2008-04-13",4.4,"UPDATED: JUL 30, 2009 75cl bottle.   Super dark brown with a fluffy brown head that settles into an oil slick.   Potent, alcoholic aroma of cocoa and espresso, with some dark candied fruit and vanilla.   The flavor is smooth, alcoholic, and rich.   The coffee isnt a forceful as in the aroma, but it still gives you a good kick.   Huge roasted chocolate malts.   Full and smooth with light, silky bubbles.   The alcohol cleans and dries the finish up nicely, keeping it from being too sticky.   This beer is just over the top, but so well done that it works well.   Fantastic, but I dont think I could kill a whole bottle again. (4.1)
Draught at The Red.   You would never believe that this is so strong.   Despite the thick and creamy mouthfeel, the alcohol and sweetness are kept in check by the coffee, roast, and bitterness.   Looks amazing with a really dark head that lasts, over a pitch black body.   Still probably the best integration of coffee into a big stout that i have tasted.   Its definitely present, but plays a supporting role to the rich malt.","down the whirlpool, California, USA","SamGamgee"

Recieved this from Taynor a couple months back, thanks Dana! Speedway Stout is black as night when poured into my snifter letting no light pass through whatsoever. A short but dense one finger beige head formed on the pour, quickly falling to a skimming with a thick ring around the glass. Leaves respectable lacing after each tip of the glass.

The aroma hits hard with big doses of roasty malt and anise. I didnt expect so much anise in a coffee stout. Theres more creaminess than coffee in this particular bottle and a some dark berriness wafts through the more pronounced aromas. All this makes for an inviting stout but I was hoping to get a little more coffee. A mild boozy spiciness brings up the backend creating a bit more depth in the aroma.

Now this is a tasty stout! Roasty malts are quickly followed by mild bittersweet coffee, anise, and a pleasant spicy alcohol that brings some of that peppery berriness. Theres still not a great deal of coffee involved but this is a top shelf stout without it. The finish is a perfect comcination of bitter coffee, dark berries, and roasty malts creating a bit more bitterness. I love my stouts with a bitter finish and this one brings it.

The mouthfeel is on the heavier side of the spectrum. This is just my picky side but it could use a touch more creaminess. Leaves some residue, without being sticky, that helps the flavor linger.

As big as this stout is the drinkability is up toward the top of the ladder. The lack of creaminess actually helps the the drinkability. 

This is, without a doubt, an excellent stout! I just dont think its a World beater! I would like to get my paws on another bottle for more extensive testing but as it stands I feel theres better examples out there.

A really well-constructed unique beer. A true semblance of flavor playing the chocolate hints with the coffee. Didnt taste the clear chocolate like a Youngs Double for instance, but it was in the background.

3442,"2008-02-02",4.4,"750ml from BevMo on La Brea, LA, night before Thanksgiving 2007.  Pours black with nice fluffy, big-bubbled but very small brown head.  Incredibly thick, oily, viscous - intense mouthfeel that just sits on your palate forever, very slight carbonation. Aroma is coffee predominant:  dark roast, no sweetness whatsoever, great roast component, as well as a slight tinge of alcohol.  A bit of dark sweet fruits in the taste, very well-balanced with some bitter coffee and chocolate notes.  Again a slight tinge of alcohol warming, but it seems to play nice with the taste as opposed to being a little off in the aroma.  Far more than most world-class stouts, this is a testament to balance:  dark fruity sweetness, malt sweetness in molasses and chocolate, bitter coffee and roast all meld together in a great harmony.","Ithaca, New York, USA","dmradus"
3442,"2008-02-02",5.0,"UPDATED: APR 11, 2011 One heck of a beer, thats for sure. Hype = warranted.  Beer poured dark, but not quite black, with red highlights and nice fluffy brown head.  The aroma of this was roasty, almost burnt.  The flavor was rich, but not overly so, but really complex.  The roastiness with a touch of coffee (not as much as I expected) hits first, a sweet amalgamation of fruit and chocolate highlights the middle, an a hoppy burn (yes, burn), which wasnt unpleasant finishes the beer.  The mouthfeel on this one was amazingly thick, perfect carbonation and balance.  One of my favorite beers that I greedily consume whenever I can get my hands on one.
RERATE April 2011.  Ive now had this beer many times including my first experience on tap at SD Taproom in San Diego today.  Okay, its time for my perfect 5.0 rating.  Just beautiful brown with rings of lacing all the way down.  Huge but not overpowering with sweet fruity chocolate and lots of coffee roast.  Just PERFECT mouthfeel...like a light powdery mouth coating, but not sticky or cloying.  It just doesnt get better for me.","Middletown, Delaware, USA","Goodgrief"
3442,"2008-02-02",4.3,"served cold from bottle. pours an oily, jet black with a small tan-colored head. the aroma is super-sweet with hints of malts and chocolates, maybe a tiny sense of alcohol in the nose. the flavor is like a mocha, roasted dark chocolate and malted hops. the back of the throat gets a wonderful aftertaste. swishing around definitely heightens flavors. such a wonderful stout. im happy to be able to find it both bottled and on tap in my area.","Alabama, USA","smashteroid"
3442,"2008-01-26",5.0,"Poured from the bottle into a snifter. Exemplary 2.5 finger head of a cocoa brown laying comfortably atop an absolute black body. Perfect stout appearance. 

I pick up in the nose a medley of chocolate and coffee, cocoa, syrup, molasses. Perfect stout smell. 

The taste floors me. I cant even conceive of a beer with more perfect balance. The coffee and chocolate meld seamlessly to create a beautiful harmony. Alcohol is hidden very well, a little bit of roasty bitterness on the finish but not off-putting like the overbitterness of other beers of the same style. Perfect stout taste. 

Carbonation is excellent, not too high or low, but exactly appropriate. Body is thick but not syrupy. Perfect stout mouthfeel. 

Throughout the drinking of this epic beer I cant help but lament that I only have one. I dont think I could stop drinking these until I passed out. Perfect stout drinkability. 

If youre noticing a trend here, its that this beer is PERFECT.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

Roasted, bitter, choc malted hops come thru also. Yeasty, roasted coffee taste stays on the back of my thoat. Letting a sip just sink in around your tounge really brings out the roasty almost woody flavors. A full tulip glass after, it has warmed my body nicely, an excellent stout, i wish i was easier to find for me! (Finished the bottle about a 1 1/2 days later, aged qualities really stood out more.

3442,"2008-01-22",4.5,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2008 Bottle. HUGE Imperial stout like most in the top 50. At first sip, I didnt believe it deserved its high placement. Aroma doesnt knock you over like bourbon county. Expedition stout has a stronger coffee aftertaste. World wide stout has more of the malty barley taste and hits harder. However, midway through the bottle, I realized that this beer does deserve its spot as it shares the good qualities of many HUGE stouts without being overpowering in any. Very balanced. If someone asked me to recommend a BIG stout, Id say this one as no flavor is strong enough to be offensive to a fan of STRONG stouts.  As far as the HUGE motor-oil stouts go, I find this the most drinkable even if you are drinking it under the table eventually.","Orland Park, Illinois, USA","LeMunche"

After a couple weeks of my brothers around the world with stouts, Ive come to realize that these over the top imperial stouts are really too much, and quite frankly too juvenile. I think that we are in this stage like the wine people where US beer (like US wine) has to go more, more, more over the top, especially with the alcohol level. More isnt always better, OK?

The aroma was strongly dominated by coffee and a roasted note that gave a clue to the bitterness that lay within.  The flavor was dominated by coffee, and was strongly bitter, though the edges had obviously been rounded out with the 2+ years of age.  There was a distinct sweetness that poked its head through the bitterness, but it was largely overwhelmed by the coffee and dark chocolates.  Little hop note to speak of.  Finishes long as the taste sits on the palate just long enough to make itself known.  Overall an excellent stout... and a great way to celebrate.","Bloomfield, New Jersey, USA","dogfishho"

1-2-09 2006 750ml bottle thanks to The Beer Sommelier.

Chewy and velvety without being cloying and has the perfect amount of carbonation. The flavor has an amazing harmony between sweet richness and enough bitterness to sustain the massive body.

Cocoa powder. A perfect hint of coffee. This is how coffee should be integrated into  a stout. The coffee  is there,  just  not  in your face. Pours a rich  black, almost pitch  with a thick reddish  khaki head. Flavor starts out with  a  lot of semisweet Belgian  chocolate followed with  notes  of molasses,  tar, leather. Rich, roasted malt. Vanilla, wood with just  the right  amount of coffee. The  coffee is there, and just  enough  to accent  the beer without overpowering it. Full  bodied.  Good carbonation. Rich and fairly  viscous. Finishes with a nice lingering hoppy and  chocolate bitterness. A most excellent beer to celebrate my one hear on this website!

Re-rate 4/22/08. Not sure of the vintage, but this particular bottle had a lot more bitter, roasted coffee flavor than my last bottle. Gone were the chocolate notes, replaces with an astringent espresso bitterness. Hmmm...","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"

Pours a deep, opaque, black with a short lived tan head.  Smell is not what I expected at all.  No coffee aromas for me, coming out of the snifter.  Rich, sweet dark fig like fruitiness, some ripe banana, alcohol in nose.  Mouthfeel is creamy, a bit rich, and still not a hint of coffee... Alcohol however, is very noticeable, and detracts from it for me.  After opening up for a while, I get the faintest hint of coffee in the aftertaste, but not like Id expect from something that mentions coffee in the Description 4 times.  Definitely not a bad Imperial Stout, but too alcoholic, not enough coffee or roasty malt flavor, and overall a let down.","Austin, Texas, USA","lb4lb"
3442,"2007-11-15",4.6,"WOW, after having this in the cellar for, about a year or so, then looking at it in the fridge for the past week, the time is finally here to pop the top of this highly anticipated beer. Black as pitch, no light at all makes its way through the glass. The inch thick creamy head slowly fades to a creamy layer of light brown foam. Coffee, shoyu, raisins, brandy, vanilla, slightly burned toast, a very busy aroma! Sweet & sour, fruit and mineral salt, bitter and tangy, loads of contrasts and complexity....all at once! This is a busy beer and could be overwhelming to the novice.  As I say in my Beer Thoughts, ""I like my beers big and thick""and this is certainly both of those things and more.

Fantastic sludge!  Intense flavors. Thick and vicious in your mouth. Mild carbonation.
First and last impressions were of coffee. Like damn, this would wake ya up in the morning. The flavors match the description perfectly (see description), all are easily noticed and enjoyed. For 12% this stuff goes down like butter. First you feel a morphine like warming in your chest and then next thing you know, youre already drunk.

The first sip is a kick in the teeth of roasted coffee, the salty taste of soy sauce, a touch of bittersweet chocolate, and the whole flavor sits in your mouth for a full minute after its been swalllowed.

3442,"2007-10-09",4.5,"750 ml bottle (2006 vintage)
Rating #600 - Ive been saving this for a special occasion.  A 600th rating seems like a great reason to open a bottle which has been in the cellar for 18 months now.  It is drinking fabulously; I cant wait to get to Ohio and pick up another one.  As it says on the label this one is huge.  It took over two hours to work my way through a single.  If you must share it with people who appreciate great beers - dont let this go to waste on a palate that wont enjoy it.
Aroma / Appearance - The body was pitch black and very oily.  A sandy colored head sheltered the fluid underneath.  Creamy tan lacing clung to the sides as I worked my way through glass after glass.  It left layers of sediment that made it clear where the full level was.  The nose was expresso, anise, cocoa and plums.  Figs, cherries, smoke and vanilla also contribute.  A dusty vinous feel permeates everything.
Flavor / Palate - The mouthfeel is dense but not suffocating.  Black coffee, anise, licorice and plums hit the tongue soon after taking a sip.  Blackberries come next followed by a lingering expresso flavor.  The malty feel is strong and intense; this is not a subtle beer.  The finish of dark chocolate highlights an incredible experience.  With easy access to this I may have competition for my current favorite - a two year old bottle of Expedition.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"
3442,"2007-09-30",3.8,"UPDATED: APR 6, 2008 bottle.  pours an opaque black with a thin cinnamon colored head that goes away quickly but leaves a good lacing.  smell is huge but of only a bit of chocolate and coffee and a lot of alcohol.  taste is the same, with alcohol dominating a bit mightier of a coffee note than is in the smell.  finishes with a dry, hoppy bitterness that lingers for a while with the warming of the alcohol.  quite carbonated, with a creamy mouthfeel that seems to leave a thick oily film.  as an IS lover, this isnt nearly as good as i thought it would be.

rerate:  lets try again!  opaque black pour, with a huge fluffy tan head that maintains a bubbly froth while i sip, and leaves generous heaps of lacing.  great chocolaty/roasty malt smell, with cocoa, some woody notes, a bit of a coffee background, and a hint of alcohol that blends well with the scents.  the coffee comes out a lot more in the taste.  a decent amount of roasted malt.  the chocolate in the nose is conspicuously absent in the taste.  quite a bit of alcohol in the taste; i dont see how people can say you cant taste the alcohol.  fairly bitter finish.  theres some sweetness in there, but its not quite enough to balance the bitterness of the coffee, alcohol, and hops.  warming to the point of being hot.  thin, airy mouthfeel considering the body, which, while not being as thick as some other stouts, isnt exactly thin.  nice lively carbonation.  i still dont dig it as much as everyone else.  and i still think its a bit of a booze bomb.  but i like it better this time than i did last time.  personally, i prefer jahva.","pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA","hiddenvariable"

I will have to try a more recent version to compare some time, but this was a very high quality beer.","Blank, Alabama, USA","sthlm"

The aroma is the main feature of this beer, with everything from raisin, teriyaki and soy sauce, vanilla (almost oaky, but its not barrel aged) licorice, coffee and some alcohol to top it off.  Flavor also contains some raisin, licorice, slight vanilla, salt, which gives way to a incredibly long roasty finish, just spectacular.","Leuven, BELGIUM","Guerde"

3442,"2007-08-11",5.0,"UPDATED: NOV 6, 2007 This review refers to a draft pour at Boneyard Bistro in Studio City, CA on 08/11/07.
The glass must have had a black hole in it, as no light escaped from this jet black beer.  The minimal tan head was appropriate for a CO2 pour (not on nitro, as I would have preferred).  Coffee and a very subtle sour cherry aroma greet the nose.  The beer crosses the threshold into the mouth with a luxurious velvety smooth texture.  Coffee!  Sour cherries lurk furtively in the huge, agreeable  coffee bitterness.  MIld astringency and a predictably bitter finish last well into the next day.  Even though the flavors are huge, they are in balance and agreeable.  One of the best examples of imperial stout I have ever had.","","User57106"

This stout poured an opaque black color with virtually no head.  Just a few tan bubbles floating around the top of the glass.  The aroma was very creamy chocolate, molasses, and a touch of strongly brewed coffee.  The flavor consisted of a huge mocha coffee presence, fresh chocolate covered coffee beans, and maybe a hint of fresh cream.  The mouthfeel was full-bodied and thick.  Not to oily, but very big and chewy.  The carbonation was very minimal, but this was one heavy beer.  Very filling.  The 12% alcohol did pack a good punch, but it was very well hidden behind the other flavors.  This was an exceptional beer.

My third bottle of this, and the age has benefited the beer magnificently. A midnight black beer with a dim tan head, quite lively for the age, with plenty of carbonation and verve. Enormous nose, but not without subtlety. Sure, theres some chocolate malt in there, but this is mostly roast coffee and mighty fine at that.

3442,"2007-06-26",4.4,"Bought July 2006, so around 1 year old. One of THE benchmark American beers, so how does it do? Pours thick espresso-brown. Black hole body topped by a thick, dense, incredible chocolate mousse head. Two and a half hours later and its still there, god dammit. Superb aroma, the richest chocolates swirling around and enveloping your olfactory senses, Im not kidding; very big, yet cool and refined. Thick, rich, creamy, palate-filling body. The flavor brings excellent bitter dark chocolate, premium espresso, malted milk, and a lot of sturdy alcoholic warmth on the back of the throat. Superb. I didnt particularly get a whole lot of coffee while drinking this (and I drink a lot of coffee) but 3 hours later after its gone the bitter/sweet flavor of coffee and coffee grounds comes through. After some of AleSmiths other solid but not perfectly satisfying offerings, Im very glad to say that Speedway Stout meets expectations (though cant drink this everyday). Is this the most that can be done within the style? Maybe not, but still a very strong offering. It would be easy to say this is a little overrated as top 10 on ratebeer, but without question this is a very impressive and very special treat.","Medford, Massachusetts, USA","minch25"

Pours a jet black body with a huge, creamy, mocha colored head. Sheets of creamy lacing cling to the sides of the glass once the head finally decides to retreat. A beautifully colored ring of foam stays around for the entire glass. My god this is what beer looks like in my dreams. On the nose we have a huge blast of coffee grounds, espresso beans, chocolate, dark fruits, licorice. Flavors of roasted coffee, milk chocolate, dark fruits, and dark malts fill the mouth with every sip. Full bodied, heavenly mouthfeel. Palate is thick and creamy, perfectly done. Finish is long and complex: bitter, roasty, sweet chocolate, coffee and dark fruits. Alcohol is noticeable but not overpowering, very warming and rewarding. Truly a world class Imp Stout.","Tampa, Florida, USA","Quake1028"
3442,"2007-06-16",4.3,"A great looking stout to say the least. Monster mocha head 
                  retains itself incredibly. Upon fading a chunky thick lace 
                  engulfs the sides of the glass.

                  One of those beers that you just dont want to take your nose 
                  away from. My buddy commented from accross the room ""man that 
                  beer smells great"". Powerful dark chocolate, and freshly 
                  ground coffee. Thick with dark fruity esters. Just an enormous 
                  complex smelling stout. Bits of flowery esters float around as 
                  well. Nice & roasty.

                  Big thick full mouth leaves a long lingering finish that tried 
                  to outdo our friend the energizer bunny. A thick bitter 
                  chocolatey fudge devours the from and mid palate transgressin 
                  into resemblances of a Boston Stoker machiato. Huge amounts of 
                  coffee is what Im getting at. Stand out dark fruitiness of 
                  plum and black currant as well as others. Alcohol is well 
                  hidden but is there.

Instead, it features lots of vanilla beans and extract, anise and dark chocolate.  The coffee does become a little more pronounced as it warms, but I still expected more.  Goes down full-bodied and terrifically silky-smooth.  Lots of dark chocolate, creamy caramel and some roasty coffee flavors upfront.  Fades to some toastiness at the end.

Strong coffee, malt, dark cherries, and chocolate throughout in the aroma.  The initial taste on this didnt blow me away like I was expecting.  A very dry dominant coffee flavor was overpowering initially.  After a few more drinks though, this thing really opened up.  It still was a little too dry, but I got a huge blast of chocolate, malt and a nice alcohol burn that wasnt too strong to drown out the rest of the flavors.  Nice stout, but wasnt as wowed as I was expecting.

Re-rate:  Much better than last time I had this...everything seems to be much more balanced and thicker in the mouth.

The first sip revealed a surpisingly sweet chocolate kick, with butter and burnt brown sugar and charchol in there too. Also a hint of honeycomb (as though a bit of Crunchie Bar had been melted down and poured in).

3442,"2007-05-17",4.1,"UPDATED: APR 18, 2009 5/17/07, 750ml, 2005 vintage, cellar aged approx. 24months. pours pitch black with tan creamy head. nose is exploding with dark chocolate, fresh dark roasted coffee, caramel, roasted nuts, and some juicy hops still barely present. flavor has lucious dark chocolate combined with robust dark coffee, caramalized nuts, cookie, and brown sugar. alcohol warms but doesnt bit. mouthfeel is silky but a tad thin. palate is long and chocolatey. carbination is real low. at 24months this seems to have mellowed but the flavor has blended together seemlessly....as i enter into the 18oz point of this beer im reminded why ive never fallen in love with speedway. it becomes rather astringent with over ripe dark fruits and really leaves something to desire. a good coffee imperial stout but after several bottles at different ages im still waiting for this beer to blow me away.4.1.   5/27/07, another sample from a bottle probably 9months old thanks holdenn.. i found the coffee roast and hops to be a bit harsh. all right, im just not going to be the biggest fan of this beer, ill find a way to live with that. 8/5/7/4/15=3.9.    11/20/07, 05 vintage aged almost 3 years. pours dark brown, low carbonation, pretty thin. this lost a lot of coffee notes. stll some silky chocolate, nuts, and coffee coming together pretty well. i cant say this has improved much with age but it holds up nicely. a solid imperial stout but over rated imo..3.9. 

10/12/08, 750ml bottle, 07, thanks to holdenn for sharing, i havent had this brew for a while and just realized that when Matt said he brought one along camping. Cool! wonderful brew again, everything is balanced and really tasty, not huge in coffee, roast, hops, or a syrupy body but mellow and to perfection. excellent. 4.0. 

4/15/09, 750ml bottle. 2009 vintage, this is the first batch after AleSmith changed their coffee and/or started roasting and brewing the coffee onsite. pours black with very small tan head. nose of vanilla, hazelnut, maple, chocolate syrup. flavors are sweet maple syrup and chocolate, hazelnut, and vanilla. this really doesnt have more coffee flavor but a more complex one and seems slightly sweeter to me. this tastes quite a bit different than previous batches and it tastes awesome. very drinkable beer, sliky, clean, and smooth finish. 4.1.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","drewbeerme"

Rich, bittersweet, with a long finish like very good espresso, without the thin sour taste of mediocre espresso.  Everything an Imperial stout should be.

Honestly, this didnt blow me away, or differentiate itself from most of the other decent imperial stouts out there.
 Id like to re-rate some time, but I really dont want to spend $13 on another bottle. I think people are intimidated by the high rating and feel insecure about rating it anything less than a 4. Maybe Ill start the trend away from rating every IS a 4.5","Ohio, USA","b33r"

3442,"2007-04-15",4.2,"Thanks to dirty_martini for this gem. Hmmm, with a beer that is as hyped as this one is I dont think its possible to not build an expectation which cannot be fulfilled. The pour was a little less viscous than I expected, lacked the oily consistency Ive seen in great impys. The pour was still black as night though, dont get me wrong. The head was standard, dark brown and thin. The aroma was not what I was expecting at all. Lacked the overall complexity you would expect of a beer of this magnitude. There was alcohol, sweet molasses, and some roast. The coffee was barley detectable and overall there was not much depth. The flavor was very alcoholic, roasted, here the coffee comes through but not much (not nearly as much as Terrapins coffee impy), and there is a bakers chocolate taste in the back of my mouth. Lack of overall complexity and depth here too. The palate is smooth, very smooth, but it lacks the viscous velvety feel that I expected to see in the pour. The finish was warm and sweet roasted. Overall I cant say I wasnt disappointed with this. It was a good impy, no doubt about it. I just dont think its a 4.36 8th on the sight impy.

Well, its easily one of the best imperial stouts Ive ever had, and definitely the best coffee beer Ive had, but its not a top 10 beer. The aroma is redolent with plummy fruits, not dominated by coffee, although its presence is there, along with a light cocoa and roast. The flavor is big and smooth, with a rich coffee-tinged roasty chewy palate. Fair sweetness, then a side of the tongue tingling astringency leading to a mildly acrid bitterness in the finish, which seems a combination of 3C type of hop and a burnt/black malt. Alcohol warming provides a nice backdrop to the end. Pretty black in color, showing a red-brown during the pour, with a firm brown head with good retention, but weak lacing.","Oviedo, Florida, USA","PhillyBeer2112"

Aromas of rich roasted coffee and dark chocolate, luxurious, soft dark fruity esters, caramel and molasses that meshes with the alcohol.

Good moderate carbonation and a crisp, dry, slick, velvety smooth full bodied mouthfeel.

Tastes of roasted dark, earthy coffee, syrupy milk chocolate, toasted caramel, nutty, burnt grains, dark molasses, a subtle dark fruitiness, the alcohol meshes quite well with the malts, providing a lingering warmth in the palate, towards the end, raw leafy, citric hops, and a dry roasted coffee, fruity, sweet cocoa finish.

The cap looks more like a coffee milkshake than carbonation, exceptional retention. This is consistently the best looking imperial stout I see poured and it runs away with the accolade, just gorgeous, menacing. Coffee leads the charge in the aroma, elegant and powerful, with a nice level of bitterness and roastiness. Chocolate is next, sweet and rich and copious, this smells like decadent candy. Also noted in the nose are ample roasted malts, slight hops, anise, dark and sour fruits, alcohol and tar, with a touch of molasses. What an aroma. Flavor is even more titillating, bursting with expensive coffee and roasted malts, chocolate and ample bitterness. Full hop attack and plenty of alcohol keep this from ever being close to too sweet. More anise, some light smokiness, some vanilla and plenty more dark fruits such as raisins and plums, cherries too. This is as full and crushing as it looks. Palate is thick and mouth coating but never syrupy, in this area this beer is a knockout, a masterpiece. Finishes dry with a robust and crackling hop bite, some bittersweet chocolate and coffee that sails on and on. This isnt my favorite imperial stout, but certainly one of the highest quality, most well made and impressive beers Ive ever had. At times I actually wish it were sweeter.","Alabama, USA","boboski"

As you graduate into drinking this, the flavor of the roasted (burnt) nuts begins to open up and you realize how overdone and unpleasant this brew can be.

Instead of repeating all the same adjectives that obviously describe this rather expensive beer ($18 per 750ml bottle), Ill give som overall impressions.  It is extremely refreshing, which is weird for a beer this big.  The bitterness is a little too much, especially on the finish.  ""Coffee-oriented"" stouts tend to up the bitterness too much for my taste.  Overall though. the flavor is really nice.  The aroma was a bit weak.

3442,"2007-01-02",4.1,"UPDATED: OCT 14, 2007 My sampling of the Speedway Stout came after numerous laps on the Imperial Stout circuit.  I must say, the gamut of stouts is a lot more uniform than I would have thought.  I find myself writing down the same aromas and flavors over and over again.  Yet my tongue, my olfactory and my eyes tell me that there is a personality to each one, distinct and apropos.  I had to reconcile that sensory observation with my notes whose monotony was beginning to take its toll on my perception of Imperial Stouts.  Things like chocolate, coffee, malts and muscat are ubiquitous.  But each stout arranges them differently.  That is, a unique orientation of the flavors that are seemingly common to all imperial stouts.  Its like a game of Go.  Two players combat each other for a Boolean outcome of victory or defeat.  The pieces are the same, the board is static and the rules are rigid, but each game is a flourishing expression of the tactical smarts and personality of the players.  Using a standardized and immutable template we can produce individual expression.  So what does AleSmiths Speedway Stout have above all others?  Its configuration, or its balance is perceptibly superior.  Speedway Stout pours with a fecund soil brown head, beneath which the body roils with carbonation.  Still, it is tar black and gives the odd impression that it oozes like sludge but retains enough beer like qualities to allow gas to push up to the head.  A small cloud stretches from the mouth of the glass deftly striking the drinkers nose with ample coffee notes  lots of deep, dark coffee smells that I associate with over-priced coffee houses.  Married to the coffee is a whiff of sweet cream, turning the bitter smell of the pedestrians beverage into a drink more fitting for an intellectual parlor.  There is also dark chocolate, whose bitterness and high coco content whet ones mouth for a velvety chocolate dessert.  Minor aromas include muscat, whose diminutive place here is accented and emphasized elsewhere in other stouts, thereby reinforcing the point made above.  And finally a strange smell of attic dust tickles the nose as if I had just wiped off an old dusty picture too close to my face.  On the tongue the Speedway Stout gently glides, but with a velocity familiar to more aggressive beers.  A considerable raking of alcohol scrapes the tongue and arraigns the senses, but the other composite flavors occupy enough space to peek through.  The titanic coffee, chocolate flavors and a newfound bit raisin poke through in a synchronized balance that gives the Speedway Stout its distinguishing shine.  I only wish the alcohol and carbonation were pulled back just a hair to allow the flavors to express themselves more audibly.  Still, the Speedway Stout is a pinnacle in Imperial Stout composition.  All the notes form perfectly to make flavorful and well weighted chords, as a good stout should do.  And heres another thanks to the Speedway Stout for forcing me to ponder on the matter and come up with a solution that satisfied me and appreciably explained why all stouts seemed to taste the same but left very different impressions on my palate.","San Diego, California, USA","GarrettB"

3442,"2006-12-21",4.0,"The once unattainable, unfathomable and utterly divine AleSmith was brought within my reach and suddenly its celestial might was reduced to a very human standing. The eulogistic comments reverberated throughout the community suggested phantasmagorian flavors, incomprehensible to the mere mortal. The reality my quatuor revealed was simply a set of well-crafted ales. Speedway had the momentum of several Imperial Stouts behind it, notably Stones, and didnt fail to impress. The body was purely black, while cinnamon brown foam coagulated densely at the top. The aroma was filled with prominent coffee, and not the charcoal you find in too many Americanized stouts, smooth with a hint of chocolate and vanilla, reminiscent of a sweet cappuccino with a touch of brown sugar and rich caramel. Simple, satisfying. The palate followed suit, opulent but balanced, with a bit of bitterness, a dab of dryness and the whisper of hops. Creamy vanilla, dark chocolate and cardamom add to the subtle complexity that is only revealed after some resting, which also serves to appease the initially vivacious carbonation. What more is there to say? AleSmith has convincingly produced one of the best Imperial Stouts Ive tasted, but dont expect it to change your life.","Los Angeles, California, USA","kepano"

3442,"2006-11-27",4.4,"Pours dark dark brown to black with a thin average density dark tan head.  The nose is mild at first sniff, though some agitation brings out full rich creamy chocolate flavors to go with the obvious lightly roasted coffee, gentle floral hops, and slightest hint of alcohol.  I really cant believe how nice this feels in my mouth.  I think I would prefer this to be a bit thicker, but the velvety smooth consistency is just so amazing that I cant help but give this a five.  Nicely subdued carbonation.  The flavor on this is really outstanding as well.  Big sweet creamy chocolate is cut by surprisingly ample floral to almost piney hops, dry roastiness and an obvious kick of alcohol.  The finish is creamy, with some   alcohol and hops.  The aftertaste is this nice light charcoal with the alcohol warming and again, hops, and then later still, some coffee (where its actually the most evident!) and chocolate.  I dont normally like to mix those chocolate flavors with hops, but this beer really blends the two well, perhaps by splitting out the times when the flavors come in a bit.

Served up at backyard patio temperature at a small tasting here in Perth.Strange name, serious stuff. This was a nice drop I must admit. It pours a deep engine oil brown with a perplexing, big moulded tan head that receded little and laced mercilessly down the glass. Thick, dry and tight aroma of fresh cracked Arabica beans, bitter, dusted chocolate, tar and singed cow-hide and just a little evidence of that ABV. Not complex, but this just worked on the nose and left its mark inside the mouth. Smoooooth, medium to medium light body, nothing big. I fear the alcohol ate the body. Lovely depth of raw Stout emotions showing some molasses, tar and leather, big licks of liquorice and cocoa, a subtle edge of smoke and just a little French dark chocolate on the bitter scale. Long and lustrous, velvety swallow just heaves all that is tasted for oh-so long. A light warmth in back, so subdued for a beer of this calibre. Gets better with each sip. This is, somehow begrudgingly, good enough to eat.  It wouldnt win on complexity, but it is a bloody good stout. (75cL, cork stoppered, date unknown)","Perth, AUSTRALIA","ALLOVATE"
3442,"2006-11-14",4.1,"UPDATED: DEC 15, 2008 Silver foil. Wow. An aroma I was not expecting but am still totally blow away by. Its a cascading, savory rich conglomoration of charred meats, mole and fresh ground Blue Mountain beans. Its lucious and sweet, with fresh bright coffee notes and longing draws of pipe tobacco. A little restrained, but elegant dark and inviting. Pour is oil black, with a ruby corner and a froth of deep brown cream and chocolate ganache. Flavor is ridiculous. Rarely does that sweet cream texture combined with such a compacted, depth and body. Its sweet, bright, salty, chocolate, roasty and creamy all at once. And even the hops make sense, in the background a parching alternation of oak, coffee beans and that sweet vine juice. I do feel that this still pales to the BA version, which carries the fine vinous and fruit body, but this is at first the best background this beer could offer. Alcohol? Totally melded in. The coffee edges a little bitter, but it still makes the beer quaffable. I love the AleSmith yeast character, its so complimentary to the beer flavors, and it brings a great unique rich fruitiness to the beer. All around exquisite.

3442,"2006-11-01",3.5,"Bottle sampled with Stegosaurus, picked up on his trip to Boston. Pours black with a gigantic brown head. Aroma of chocolate, hops, and roasted malts. The flavor is chcolate, roast and bitter in the finish. Good beer.","Croydon, Pennsylvania, USA","Beerdedone"
3442,"2006-10-30",4.9,"75cl bottle from Belmont Station, Portland. Black with tan head. Lovely intense dark malt aroma, but smooth, not harsh, promises espresso and bitter choc.  In mouth, bitter choc, fruit is blackberry/currant. Then it is just so full in the mouth. Finish goes on forever. Utterly amazing. Better than I hoped, better than I thought. Great espresso coffee. Little criticism is the over carbonation. Finish has more espresso coffee and dark choc delivered on a full body. Hop is there, but doesnt dominate. Takes you to another plain of sensual enjoyment. Coffee is really distinctive. Stunning. Only point lost for carbonation.","Ashford, Kent, ENGLAND","harrisoni"
3442,"2006-10-29",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 24, 2009 In short: A huge roasted coffee stout.  Simple, unrefined, intense, excellent.
How: Bottle 750ml.  Many times, this re-rate for a 1+ year old bottle
The look: Black body with a medium tan head.
In long: Nose is moderately roasted and with a moderate roasted coffee beans presence.  Less coffee than one could expect.  A fantastic mouthfeel, this is a big big big beer that manages to avoid being syrupy.  Taste is intense.  Medium-high roastiness level, black coffee and roasted coffee beans, a light chocolate presence.  Almost no fruity notes.  Almost no alcohol presence whatsoever.  A nice bitterness in the finish that comes from the roastiness and not from the hops (hops that are unnoticeable btw).  Driveways, not Speedways, should be associated with drinking this monster of a stout.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"
3442,"2006-10-26",4.4,"25 oz bottle, 2003 vintage, via kujo9.  Pours a completely pitch black colored body under a creamy fine bubbled chocolate brown head.  Very good retention with some spotty lacing.  Aroma is thick and intense.  Tons of roasted malt and coffee, some alcohol, dark fruits, chalk, and bitter chocolate.  Flavor is equal parts roast, chocolate and coffee up front.  Finishes with heavy coffee, burnt malt, and warming alcohol.  Extremely robust all around.  Long lingering burnt and roasted malt, moderately bitter finish.  Mouthfeel is thick, full bodied, and oily in texture.  Carbonation is almost perfect, very soft and fine.  All around, very good.  Only thing I didnt care for was that the alcohol is a little overbearing, especially on the finish.  A top 5 Imperial Stout for me, but with the age on this, I have to give the nod to Expedition at the 3 year mark.","Sunbury, Pennsylvania, USA","kramer"

Appears a pitch black with a dark tan head that slowly fades out. Plenty rings of lacing are left around the glass.
Smell is roasty, with caramel, coffee, cocoa, and vanilla.
Taste is of the same aromas maybe toned down slightly in a nicely contained mix that is addictive.
Mouthfeel is sweet, full bodied, with coffee bitterness and sugary complexities.
I really enjoyed this. The only problem was that the 12% abv was well noticable, which makes this more of a sipper.","Collegeville, Pennsylvania, USA","weeare138"

Not so much something youre going to go out and get hammered on (but if you choose to do so, you most definitely will, in super fashion), but more of something you want to sit around and sit while watching Bumfights.

Big and chewy. Bold and brassy. Chocolate on the palate, but still dominated by coffee. A bit toned down in the barrel-aged version, which Im not convinced is a plus. Fair amount of hoppy bitterness to prevent it getting too one-dimensional. Obviously alcoholic. Very impressive. I marginally prefer the normal version to the barrel aged; the brashness of this beer is what I like about it.","London, Greater London, ENGLAND","chriso"

Black with a brown fizzy head and lots of soapy lacing.  Smells of cafe latte and Irish Cream topped with Fresh Prunes and sweet caramels.   This has some abbery ale qualities!  Malts in the mouth are strong on the breads and cherries.  Wisps of alcohol break through... but its so marvelously coy.  Distinctly Stout with the best characteristics of unibroue and Bells and Rogue all thrown in for good measure.  This is altogether more pleasant than I expected.

3442,"2006-09-05",4.6,"UPDATED: MAY 23, 2007 This beer poured a dark brown/near black, with a 1 inch head that was quite dense.  Part of the great thing was that the head NEVER faded and even the very last sip at the bottom had some foam on top.  Anyway, the aroma struck me as vanilla, and raisiny, with a bit of coffee, of course.  Flavor was similar with some hints of liquorice, and espresso, while there were just enough hops to balance the flavors upfront.  Like many other fine beers, this one is perfectly balanced, with no singular flavor being spotlighted.  Oddly enough though, I think Old Numbskull has a slightly thicker mouthfeel, but the carbonation was still perfectly low.  The extra coffee in this beer was quite delightful as though, since my friend and I were both sleepy.  A perfect way to kick off a going away party for someone.  

Okay, Im having this a second time, and the flavor is utterly brilliant.  Chocolate, vanilla, buttery hops, its all there.  But its kinda flat!  No head on this thing what-so-ever, and I poured this sucker FAST.  Theres some carbonation, but absolutely no creamy mouthfeel.  What happened?","Fort Worth, Texas, USA","RollinHard"

Midnight black with large tan head.  Initially has a creamy, very smooth espresso and dark chocolate flavor - with more warming the alcohol and astringency comes out more but fades again as it approaches room temperature.

Wow taste is full and creamy choclate and the coffee hits you like a ton of bricks.  Ive never tasted anything like this before, maybe its because its my first full flavored Imperial Stout and I have to say, I didnt know if I was ready for it yet being a novice to craft beer, but this is something special to me, and the whole bottle is mine.  The alcohol is present, but not overpowering.  It does leave a bit of a bitter aftertaste.

3442,"2006-08-29",4.3,"Ominous brown head, huge cappuccino-like frothiness that settled into a thick ring of micro-bubbles around the glass.  Absolutely pitch black, with maybe just a very slight reddish-amber color when held up to the light.  Sweet, malty aroma with elements of molasses, caramel, coffee, cocoa, roasted grains, some slight nuttiness.  Ridiculously huge, overwhelming flavors of dark roasted grains, malt, molasses, dark brown sugar, coffee, cocoa... some slight alcohol presence but not too much.  The alcohol makes itself apparent after a few sips, in the form of a gentle warming of the throat and esophagus.  Slick, smooth, silky texture, but not too sticky--a reasonably dry finish, where the heavy hops make themselves apparent.  Pretty amazing.

Some dark fruits, earthy wood notes, roasted barley, and a little alcohol follow close behind. Creamy smooth and rich with a big full body and some chewiness. A multitude of flavors is not surprising given the aroma. Sweet roasted grains, coffee, bitter chocolate, and some sweet dark fruit all come through. Balance is provided by lightly astringent bitter citrus and spicy hops, finishing long and dry. Alcohol is never really apparent in the flavor, but is certainly evident in its effect. Great brew with a well deserved reputation. Now all I need to to do is get my hands on the BA version.","Morehead City, North Carolina, USA","DrBayern"

UPDATE 5/20/9: On tap at Toronado, SD. Black with a large dark brown creamy head. A beautiful beer. Thick wall of lacing. Willy Wonka Aroma. Maybe Willy Wonka after hes had too many espressos.

3442,"2006-08-19",4.0,"UPDATED: DEC 6, 2007 750mL bottle acquired from my Secret Santa.  Pours a thick jet black with a small, tan head, which fades to a thin film.  My first beer in my DFH snifter.  Complex--aroma of coffee, molasses, caramel, roasty dark chocolate, black licorice, alcohol, roasted malts, a light oatmeal softness, a tiny bit of soy.  I may or may not have picked up on a little earthy hops, but I may be making it up.  The tastes bitterness in the finish seems to mainly come from the coffee and roasty malts--dry finish, by the way.  Dominant tastes are coffee and roasty malts, then the chocolate, licorice, soy and alcohol.  The mouthfeel isnt necessarily thick, but is definitely creamy with very soft light to moderate carbonation--wonderful.  Im almost sad that I dont have anybody to share this with me tonight, but alas, the gf has gone out with her friends.  This is a very rich beer, Im going to need a couple glasses of water to finish this.

Get the idea?  This incredible flavor brewed up to a 12% ABV that knocked my socks off!  The absolutely perfect slight bitter, roasted malt coffee, aftertaste was my favorite to date for any imperial stout that Ive ever tasted.  This is my highest ranked beer to date.

3442,"2006-07-30",4.7,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2009 7/30/2006: This beer is a perfect blend of everything that a truly great beer should be. It pours black with a creamy brown head. Moderately carbonated - not too much, but too litte. The beer is not too heavy, but not to light on the palate - again a wonderful balance. A perfect blend of coffee, chocolate, caramel, and roastiness in both the aroma and taste.  The alcohol is nicely disguised. Beer becomes a little more bitter as it warms, but more and more flavors also come out. This beer truly lives up to expectations.
2003 Vintage on 7/28/2007: Rich and roasty with chocolate in the flavor and coffee in the finish.  It is moderately dry, but the carbonation level is beginning to creep upwards over the years.
2004 Vintage on 7/28/2007: A bit less carbonated than the 2003 and not as dry. The flavor is mostly semi-sweet chocolate.
2005 Vintage on 7/28/2007: Has a creamy brown head. It is stronger with more alcohol and bitterness in the aroma and flavor than the previous vintages. There is not much coffee flavor in this vintage, but there is quite a bit of roasted malt flavors.

Big malt aroma with some floral and hoppy suggestions.  Thick, and foamy consistency...this is a big beer!  Sweet malt base flavor mixes with a complex grouping of coffee, roasted malts, caramel, chocolate molasses and hops.  The sweetness and warmth suggest the presence of the high alcohol percentage but the alcohol taste is lost amidst the other flavors.  I found the sweetness to linger slightly too much in the aftertaste, but aside from that the flavors are excellent.

Aroma is of strong coffee and slighty sweet malts. The taste is very strong, typical of an imperial stout. Tastes as if they added alot of coffee as they imply.

3442,"2006-07-20",4.6,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2006 This is a really good beer!  The aroma is chocolates, coffee, and roastiness.  My biggest gripe with this beer is that the aroma doesnt transfer over to the flavor as well as I expected it to.  The coffee flavors were very subdued in the flavor as compared to the aroma that you get from this beer.  Even with that being said, this is still an excellent beer, and I have never been disappointed by an AleSmith brew...now if I could only get my hands on the impossible BA Speedway.  Im sure that would be a real treat!!



Rerate:
I was able to try some 2003 bottles of this with 3 years of age on them, and DAMN were they good!  I really dont think the overall score will go up much, but I had to give the flavor a bump up from an 8 to a 9.  The roasted coffee flavors really shined in the vintage bottle of this that I had.

3442,"2006-07-06",4.5,"UPDATED: NOV 29, 2006 Very, very impressive. Im glad it lived up to the hype. The Speedway Stout comes in a massive champagne bottle. I was suprised to see green glass after I poured out the black oil from the interior. As soon as the cap was popped, the aromas of coffee and milk chocolate came waving through the air. The look of this monster was dark and ominous. The caramel colored head lasted a nice amount of time. When this buttery liquid cascaded into my mouth, I was born again! The milk chocolate flavors mixed perfectly with the roasted malts. The coffee flavor didnt dominate as I had expected--everything in balance. Before I knew it, my glass was half empty. There is no way a 12% monster like this should go down like a glass of chocolate milk, but it does. This actually reminded me most of Old Rasputin (underrated), which has a very similar taste and mouthfeel. Cant wait to get into my next bottle.","Ohio, USA","thebaldwizard"

3442,"2006-07-04",4.1,"2002 Bottle: Oil can black pour with a thin, mocha head that doesnt stick around.  The nose is nice and roasty, with subtle hints of fudge and vanilla.  The roastiness is more malty, that coffee bean.  Thick mouthfeel and mild carbonation.  The body is chocolate malt through and through.  The coffee has really faded over the years, letting the fudgey malts take over.  The chocolate is supported by sweet toffee and caramel, light earth and wood as well.  Really a great dessert beer.  Id be interested to try this fresh to see how the coffee has faded over the years.  Happy B-day Emily!","Jasper, Indiana, USA","SpudClampDawg"

3442,"2006-06-25",4.3,"UPDATED: AUG 9, 2008 bottle. Ive been waiting for this one. It pours black as pitch with a lasting dark tan head. Swirling the snifter reveals lacing like a motherfucker. The aroma is huge of espresso & cream, a little wood. It makes my mouth water. God, this is so damned delicious. Its nothing truly unique for an imperial stout, just the perfect balance and level of all the expected notes. Theres strong coffee, dense chocoalte, oak, walnuts, and more which pummel the palate in a drying, coating fashion. This beer is HUGE!

[8.08.08]

750 ml. Pours absolutely black. I’m shining a flashlight directly into the goblet and getting no light penetration here. Really thick lacing, a small tan head, and dense cascades are all noticed from a firm swirl. The aroma is pretty sharp, almost vinegary at first, but minutes pass and everything becomes more rounded and even. Now, I get very assertive coffee beans on top of espresso, mocha, nut shells, brownies, and hickory. I thought I had overrated this one in my younger years. But a sip makes me a bit more sure of myself. Genuine coffee character is honestly not the stand out flavor on this one, it kind of pokes out in the finish amid a wash of dry suggestions of espresso. Earth, dark chocolate are noted and the finish is especially dry. Wow, 12%? I cannot detect that. Some hints of smoke, miscellaneous roast, and milk are found. The palate is heavy, sure, but not as chewy as Ten Fidy for instance. This is damned good.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"

3442,"2006-06-20",4.6,"750ml bottle.  Aroma:  Big aroma of chocolate, coffee, malt, and alcohol.  Lots of alcohol in the nose.  I also picked up some hints of smoke, leather, and prunes.  Appearance:  Very, very black.  Small light tan head didnt stick around long.  Some nice lacing.  Flavor:  Coffee!  From the slightly sour/acidic taste of lightly roasted beans to the full roasty flavor of dark roasted beans.  Roasted malt, caramel, and cherry flavors also very prevalent.  Alcohol kicks in towards the finish.  Palate:  Full bodied.  Beer almost coats the mouth with its fullness.  Light carbonation.  Alcohol warming very noticeable on roof of mouth and back of tongue.

One of my all time favorites, and arguably the beer that got me into beer.  Wow.

I had this beer on tap at the brewery a couple days ago: amazing... Much more coffee and bittersweet chocolate.  Hugely velvety.  On tap Id give this a 4.6 (at least), and I hate anyone who can get their hands on the barrel aged version of this.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","nhorween"

Flavor starts out with coffee leading into dark chocolate and a creamy caramel bitter finish. This beer is very drinkable for a full-bodied beer. Very good late morning after breakfast.

3442,"2006-06-14",4.3,"Rating 300.  Bottle, served at cellar temp.  Im guessing its a 2003 bottle (sticker label, banner says ""Award Winning"").  Anyway, this was sitting in my cellar for 2 years, so it was time to crack it open.  And, as soon as I cracked it, I got a wonderful whiff of what was to come.  Ahhh, love at first pffft.  It has all the requisite aromas that you want in a great stout.  Cherry cordials, licorice, brandy, slight coffee, dark chocolate and a nice breadiness that holds it all together.  I could have inhaled this for hours, but this one is for imbibing.  First sip ... when they say they add a ton of coffee, they aint foolin.  Very roasty in the mouth, but also sweet and slightly alcoholic.  It goes through a few transitions.  First, in the mouth, it starts roasty and sweet, but finishes like a blackberry brandy and chocolate liqueour.  A different sort of transition takes place with the temperature.  With large bottles, such as this, I like to see how the beer reacts to different environments.  When chilled, this is excellent ... as good as an imperial stout can be.  When straight from the fridge, its hoppy and dry and pretty much in a state of suspended animation.  Not its proper state.  However, as it warms to room temperature, it becomes overly sweet and alcoholic, still good, but too sweet for my taste.  Still, this is an excellent creation, and one Ill go back for a few times.","Windsor, Connecticut, USA","SwedeDog"

Re-rate, July 07 after Westv 8, and a quad horizontal of St. Bernies 12, Westv. 12, and Roche 10, Im moving this beer to a 5.0 from a 4.9.... the closest thing Ive had to a 5.0, perfect beer, undoubtedly the #1 impy stout in my world.

This beer hasnt lost to any other impy stouts in my tastings. Only aroma and appearance remain at 9/10 ratings. Re-rate, Mar 07 in a horizontal w/ Peche Mortel and Mephistopheles, ever so fantastic, beautiful hop and coffee malt balance, June 06 re-rate stands, although if youre looking for over the top coffee, the Peche does beat this one out. Best overall Impy stout, though, is the AS Speedway. Re-rate, June 06: Thanks, doulos. Freakin fantastic, no idea what was holding me back on the first tasting!!! Beautiful appearance, nice tan-chocolate head. Mouthfeel was perfect, asbsolutely perfect, syrup like, motor oil type feel, just nice. The aroma was coffee and dark fruits with some dry nuts. Flavor was coffee, chocolate as it warmed, roasted nuts, and some fruitiness (prunes?). Would not know this was 12% alcohol, well-blended in the flavor and aroma profiles. Finishes in a really complex fasion, initially just a bit bitter, good hop touch. Then after a few seconds, the late aftertastes arrive, nice zing on the tongue, but not a bunch of junky hoppy flavors. This was one of the best hopped stouts Ive ever had, where the bittering and zesty/zing levels were there to support the relatively sweet malt base, but not in a way to overpower with pine, floral, or citrus attributes. Original Rating: A nice stout, but I found it to be over-rated. The Peche Mortel was superior, as was the DFH WWS. Poured with a small brown head that wasnt overly impressive and laced a bit. The aroma was sharp, coffee and a touch of alcohol as it warmed. The mouthfeel was fairly thick and moderately carbonated. The flavor was coffee, sweet to start with and bitter to finish. Would have another one, but not at any elevated prices.","","User37895"

Not as bold of an aroma as expected, but it is quite alluring with licorice, cocoa, coffee, musty hops and dates.  The viscous body delivers a panoply of my favorite flavors: dark chocolate, caramel, earthy and musty hopsand the center of it all: coffee. Bold, pungent, yet not over-roasted, and lightly creamed. Amazing. Its chewy and sweet, but is well balanced by the roasty and hoppy bitterness and tart acidity that the some of the syrupy Belgians just dont typically have.

Perhaps my handicap is that I do not drink coffee, and have not for years. Maybe the BA version will be better, and I surely hope so, because this tastes like a cup of sanka with a shot of smirnoff in it.

Im sorry, but a strong coffee flavor does not mean a good beer! I rely on these guys at AleSmith to hook up the good beers, but this one is not good, unless you are a coffee addict. Do you go to Baskin Robbins and order coffee ice cream?

Really? With all those other flavors available?

3442,"2006-05-09",4.2,"From Bottle.  Incredibly rich, thick pour of black chocolate milk frothed with a tall creamy layer of walnut shelled head.  Swirling the beer keeps rejunenating an amazing growth of new foam.  Aroma of bittersweet dark swiss chocolate, medium roaste coffee beans, and a hint of bourbon.  A light raspberry fruitiness drizzled over a freshly baked prune tart pastry.  The mouthfeel is incredibly rich, thick, and creamy without being excessively heavy or syrupy.  The first wave of flavor brings plenty of chocolate to the palate, accompanied by a balanced hops bitterness.  After the chocolate and hops comes a touch of raisin and dried prune.  The finish is experienced in two seperate phases as well.  The first half highlights some bourbon soaked oak chips grilled over a charcoal blaze.  The second wave and final smack is of a mocha cappucino topped with whipped cream and shavings of dark swiss chocolate.

3442,"2006-04-28",4.8,"This beer has everything I want in a beer: strong, rich, creamy, great aroma, and a smooth flavor. It poured very black with a dark brownish head. The second pour had a much larger head. The aroma was marvelous with a choclate and coffee all over. The flavor was very similar but the was so smooth. There was barely any bitterness at all. The alcohol was barely noticable til the end where it seemed a little strong. If I could drink one beer that I have had so far for the rest of my life it would have to be this. I dont even know what to say, Im speachless. Go buy this beer.","columbus, Ohio, USA","bgburdman9"
3442,"2006-04-28",4.7,"This beer is Marvelous.  It poured black with a lasting brown head.  smelled like coffee but not as strong as anticipated.  On the palate it was amazing.  First was a refreshing chocolate sensation followed by a return to almost nothing and then it comes back with a smooth coffee finish.  alcohol was tasted but it wasnt strong at all.  Delicious.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Zinnamon"

Delicious carmel, coffee, chocolate taste. Not overwhelming, just right.

The bitterness in the coffee finish keeps you taking another sip. Many thanks to Alaskaiscold for this amazing brew.","new albany, Indiana, USA","daalamar"
3442,"2006-04-18",4.3,"750ml bottle: Great grainy coffee foam head. Good aroma of coffee and resin and burnt chocolate. The flavor is bursting with everything you could ask from a stout. Dark chocolate and smooth coffee with nice roast notes with a full mellow body. The only negative was the nagging alcohol taste that distracted from the underlying  pleasure the flavors brought. This was near perfect but not quite.","Nashua, New Hampshire, USA","JugOPunch"

Thick and intense body with plenty of dark roasted coffee and chocolate. Rich in licorice towards the finish. Plentyful of all things expected in an American high rated imperial stout. A bit of alcohol comes through when warmed up a bit but this vineous character, even though it is prominent, never dominates in any way, just warming. Finish is quite bitter for this kind of beer and has a grainy palate to it. Speedway is an appropriate name for this brew as it gives me an image of a such track with motor oil, fumes, noise and power. Its a biggie. Can someone send me some more?","Stockholm, SWEDEN","MrWalker"
3442,"2006-04-15",4.4,"I opened this bomber with the intent on getting sleepy, forgetting that this beer was coffee-based. However, overpowering alcohol is sufficient enough to soothe and grog my mind (although I expect my dreams will be quite vivid). A thick and viscous black pour with a reverse cascade produces a slow-settling, oily tan head. Sweet coffee aroma with sawdust and almost-burnt chocolate cupcakes. Flavor finds unbridled potency above chocolate and coffee roasts. Smooth and syrupy, this goes down way too easy for the amount of alcohol within. F*ck the hype, this is legendary.

I tried to sniff this for about 2 minutes trying to get some aroma from it but not nothing.  I kind of detected dark fruits and alcohol.  It was remarkably light in body for an imperial stout.  Coffee flavors dominate and some licorice.  Of course it is well balanced like no other and as smooth as hell.  However, I thought this fell way short of the hype.  It was good but Ive definitely had better imperial stouts.  RERATE:  Had this on tap at the brewery and it is way better.  Thicker texture and way more flavorful.  Tons of coffee.","Seattle, Washington, USA","Zeswaft"

RERATE:  had on tap at brewery.... dificult position now.  twice the bottle was so-so, but the draft sample was simply extraordinary.  5 worthy.  it was more coffee, massive balance, no alcohol and just extremely tasty.  so ill just raise my rating halfway.","chicago, Illinois, USA","sersdf"

Black pour with a very large head, good lacing. Aroma is strong with coffee, and all the dark stuff. Chocolate, caramel, licorice, roast, dark fruits, its all here. Dont forget some alcohol heat. Despite how well this is made, I just dont find it that fascinating. Its big. Its balanced. That alone is quite an accomplishment. But the flavors just dont work for me. I bet the BA one is amazing though. 8/5/7/4/15=3.9
2016 rerate: Black pour, tan head, good lace/retention. Aroma is coffee, roast, chocolate, caramel, lesser notes of darker fruit and alcohol. Full bodied, somewhat creamy, coffee flavor is present but not overpowering compared to a lot of modern offerings. Alesmith succeeded in making a big imperial stout that doesnt come off as big. Its good but the fact that it scores so highly still baffles me. 8/4/7/4/15 = 3.8.","California, USA","ABUSEDGOAT"
3442,"2006-04-09",4.6,"bottle - Pours jet black with a dark, moderately sized head that really hangs around, leaving nice lacing.  The aroma is of heavily roasted malts and coffee.  The flavor is of course primarily the roasted malt and coffee, but is quite complex as well.  The palate is huge and the 12% alcohol well masked and very warming.  Then theres a smooth, lingering finish.  This brew is altogether excellent.  I can see why its so highly rated.  Certainly the Russian Imperial Stout style is highly regarded in general, but more importantly this is an exsquisite example of the style.  Get it and enjoy.","fort wayne, Indiana, USA","patrick767"

Beer pours a nearly opaque, very dark brown color with a huge, creamy, tan, mostly lasting head. The aroma is lushcious: malty with heavy, yet individually discernable notes of roasted grain, caramel, molasses, coffee and chocolate; trace of herbal hop and resin/pine; light yeast note of cellar; miscellaneous notes included moderate vanilla, light tobacco, butterscotch, oak and candy sugar. The flavor is plush: heavily sweet, moderately bitter with a long, moderately bittersweet finish with tons of genuine coffee aromas taking a last bow in the retros. The body was luxurious: medium-to-full, the texture was velvety and the carbonation was lively. There was a light, warm alcoholic feeling in the finish.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","luckygirl"

Pours a light black with a huge brown head.  Aroma is chocolate, coffee, and caramelly roasted malts.  Flavor is wonderful and complex.  Chocolate and coffee dominate, but theres so much else in there - sweet caramel maltiness, some bitter hoppiness, and a nice alcohol presence.  Palate is thick, but not cloying or syrupy.

Strong coffee, bitter chocolate, and peppery alcohol. I think the high alcohol content works against this brew and makes for a harsh finish.

3442,"2006-03-28",4.8,"Bottle. The elusive bugger I was finally able to track down in Scottsdale, AZ. And then, as if it was taunting me, I saw it 2 weeks later in Chicago, at Archer Liquors near Midway Airport. Of course a week later I called to see if they still had it and it was gone. Oh well, at least I had my one bottle. Rich, milk chocolate aroma with some sweetness evident. Huge, brown head. Not often you come across a truly brown head, but this was one of them. Rootbeer float-like head; fully opaque body. Initial mouthfeel is strong alcohol, but shorthly thereafter the alcohol mellows. A sweet hoppy initial mouthfeel that is to die for. This is one brew that was well worth the wait. I liken it to Bear Republic Big Bear Black Stout. I would like to do a side-by-side.

3442,"2006-03-08",4.6,"This has to be the richest beer I have ever come across.  It is huge and sweet, with just about nothing but coffee and chocolate all over.  The sweetness is cut by the assertive bitterness in the back from both the coffee/roasted malt and the hops.  I cant explicitly taste hops, but their presence is detectable.  They leave the finish clean, balancing out a bit of the massive sweetness.  Still, this beer might be a bit too sweet for me.  More complexity would also be nice.  There seems to be a huge amount of hops in here, but if they were to use even more, this would be my dream beer.  As is, its still world-class.","North Shore, Massachusetts, USA","mkgrenwel"

Very nutty toasted malt nose with obvious coffee and some chocolate, lightly sweet. Huge bitter coffee kick at first taste. Lots of alcohol, though this fades after a few sips. A little nutty with dark fruits, some chocolate, molasses and spices. Acrid finish (not a strong point) with a pleasant lingering coffee aftertaste. Huge body in the mouth & rather lively. Some age might soften the harsher edges: currently there is just too much acrid coffee punch.

3442,"2006-01-28",4.5,"Another one of the beers I recently picked up at Hi-Time Wine in Costa Mesa, and curiously one of several Imperial Stouts with coffee I seem to have run into lately.  Out of the green 750 ml. bomber, and into the goblet, the beer came out deep reddish black with a one finger thick light brown head.  The body was opaque when held up to the light with some brown highlights at the extreme edge.  Aroma was chocolate malt and leafy hops mingling together.   The first taste was about as intense as I have ever had in a beer.  The acrid roastiness of the malts provided the backbone of the flavor profile, while the green bitterness and acidity of the hop oils provided the muscular heft. Together they had quite a tug of war on my tongue.  I believe the hops won out in the end.  They claim to have poured in pounds and pounds of coffee beans in the brew, but the other flavors were so strong, the coffee was barely detectable as a distinct taste.  There was a lingering note of chocolate in the aftertaste.  The body was thick and smooth, providing an excellent feel on the palette, which was spoiled only a little by the peppery spiciness of the alcohol.  The strength was well covered by the abundance of the flavor while the beer was in the mouth, but since there are no taste buds in the stomach, the warmth spreading to the extremities from there was dead giveaway.  This is a beer best suited for a nightcap duty, although the large bomber size gets in the way of that a bit.  I would love to see what some age can bring out, as at this fresh stage the hops dominated everything else.  Maybe I can get my hands on some more to set it aside for a while.","Alpharetta, Georgia, USA","rajendra82"
3442,"2006-01-28",4.5,"Rating #1000 from my esteemed colleague, Kevin. Pour is opaque as expected with a very thin ring of bubbles. Nose is much better than I was anticipating-medium coffee, green apple, sweet malty roastiness. As it warms alcohol and toffee come out. Quite nice. Maybe one of the best beers that I have ever smelled. Taste-medium creamed coffee, lighter on the roast and smoke than I was anticipating. Chocolate powder, CO2, slight tobacco, subtle vanilla, and a light hop character. What makes this beer world class is not its flavors-it is the fact that there is so much flavor without being overboard and without any of the flavors stepping on each other. Truly a reflection on the skills of its creator.","Carrollton, Texas, USA","Lumpy"

Pours black with brown head, with good lacing. The coffee flavor is there, but not overdone. I really enjoyed the changes to the palate as it creeped toward room temp. Finish is dry, roasty, and bitter. Not cloying at all. Probably the most complex imperial stout I have had to date (there is some competition in the queue). I am glad I waited for this one.

A little burnt toast, a lot of cocoa, and a lot of great roasted smokey malt smells here.  Not quite as viscous as I expected and actually a bit sweeter, but still a very nice brew.

Head is sand color with a little bit of pink tint and breaks down to patches of foam spots on top of the liquid.  The aroma isnt as strong from my glass as it was from smelling it directly from the opened bottle but thats sounds reasonable.  Huge dosage of chocolate meets my nose and has a small coffee aroma.  Palate is thick and leaves behind a rich coating all along my tongue and mouth.  In the flavor,  there is a staggering richness and full bodied flavor to be described and dwelled upon through out every sip.  A lot more coffee is found in the flavor than the aroma but the flavor will cancel out the noted chocolate. Strong presence of roasted malt. Also a background tasting of vanilla as well as bittering hop. Only after letting the contents warm up a little bit did i notice the alcohol and its freindly warmness.

Initially, strong scents of coffee overwhelm the entire room, but after the beer has settled some, nice chocolate and cookie dough notes begin to shine through.

Pouring out black with a creamy dark brown head, this has a myriad of aromatic sensations that only increase as the drink (and, I suspect, the drinker) heats up.  Most evident is the hot espresso-like smell.  This is solidly backed up by SWEET caramel malts, roasted barley, licorice, and a splattering of dark chocolate.  Creamy and hot in the mouth, the flavors begin by mirroring the aroma.  Coffee leads the way, but not overbearingly so.  This is followed quickly by HOT alcohol, a gooey caramel sweetness, chocolate, licorice, dark dried fruits, and some earthy hop bitterness.

3442,"2005-07-20",4.5,"Taster from the PIB.  Pours a deep 30 weight oil black.  Thank god it tastes and smells way better than oil.  A deep/rich roasted coffee aroma permeates the nose.

Quite possibly the best stout i will ever have.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","porterdude"
3442,"2005-07-18",4.6,"Bottle.  Numerous drinkings, but I finally put some notes down on my last sampling.  Thick jet black pour.  Huge aroma of coffee and roasted malts.  Lots of coffee and chocolate flavors.  Creamy low fine carbonation.  Theres some alcohol warmth, but not what you might expect for 12%.  But the 12% will assert itself if you dont pay attention to how much you drink, which is fairly easy with this brew.","Norcross, Georgia, USA","beeryum"
3442,"2005-07-18",4.6,"Easily one of the best beers Ive ever had.  Dark as night, very thick, with a powerful aroma.  Flavor is excellent, strong coffee, slight sweetness, then bittersweet finish.  Alcohol is masked by the coffee, but you feel the 12% after finishing a bottle.  It is really like no other stout.  This completely destroys Stone Imperial Russian.  Step aside poseurs, this beer is not for you.","San Diego, California, USA","trokini"
3442,"2005-07-18",4.2,"UPDATED: JUL 29, 2007 RERATE, courtesy of a bottle given to me by Zinister.  THANKS!!!  Start your engines, boys, the race is on.  Well start out by pouring this luscious, thick, oil into our glass.  Allow the oil to adjust to a temperature around 50 degrees Farenheit  to allow for maximum performance.  Note the aromas of coffee, chocolate, and dark berry accompanied by a definite ethyl alcohol presence.  Once the hypnotizing aroma has been allowed to permeate the air, step on the gas and a enjoy the sensation of dark chocolate and faint cherry running laps around a track of coffee.  Watch out for the sting of alcohol as the vapor trail left by the sliding liquid down the track of your throat dissipates.  Thick, coating feel; the tires really grip the pavement with this brew.  Outstanding, but I wonder how different it would be with a lower ABV.  

Bottle that leaked during shipment, so my rating may be a tad reflective of that.  Ill update after a fresh bottle arrives.  For the iterim, pours a thick, oil-like black.  Completely opaque with little head.  Aroma is slight cherry with wine and coffee.  Flavor has loads of chocolate and coffee rounded out by a biting tinge of barleywine.  Hyped up, but not bad.","Ugly, Hot, and Humid Spring, Texas, USA","KAggie97"

Aroma of roasted malt with some coffee notes though not as dominating as I was expecting from reading all those ratings. Taste is dominated by roasted malt, caramel and coffee with a real creamy texture that I enjoyed. Bitter ending but not as hops explosive as I was expecting from other reviews. Overall, this is a good imperial stout but to me it doesnt match Bells Expedition or even Storm King; but then again, Im not the most avid stout drinker out there.

750 mL bottle.  Thanks to OhioDad via Jonathan.  Pours with a deep deep black with a thick dark brown head.  Left considerable lacing.  Aroma was absolutely dominated with espresso coffee though plenty of roasted malt and caramel made its way through though chocolate was supressed from the big coffee presence.  In the flavor, chocolate was able to be perceived, though the coffee was still big in the profile.  Some slight crystal malt sweetness come through along with roasted malt and some douginess.  Flavor was fairly dry for an Imperial Stout, especially in the finish.  Hops made its way through the ruckus both in flavor and bitterness though a considerable amount of that bitterness was from roasted malts I believe.  Alcohol was there, but not overpowering with just a bit of warmth in the finish.  Mouthfeel was a notch below DL, but still considerably thick and smooth but not as coating as DL.  Great beer, but no 5.","Durham, North Carolina, USA","BlueDevil0206"

3442,"2005-06-27",4.6,"05 champagne bottle thanks to OhioDad!  Tasted head to head against Stone RIS and the Dark Lord, this guy had its work cut out for it.  The coffee aroma rushes to my nose as soon as the bottle is opened.  There are more hops present in the aroma than Dark Lord has to offer, but theyre equally hard to discern because of the massive coffee smell.  Pour is black with a dark tan head that dissipates surprisingly quickly.  The body is slightly thinner than I had hoped for, but still hefty.  Flavor matches up with the aroma perfectly.  Huge coffee flavor -- its clear that its higher quality coffee than in DL, but theres less going on around it.  The roasted malt is great, but still slightly one dimensional.  Notes of vanilla and some bitter chocolate float around in the background.  The hops presence is stronger than in DL, but I think that is almost a fault in this case.  The finish is too bitter.  I have another bottle I plan to age for a while, but Im not sure that the bitterness will mellow out because its almost completely due to roasted malt and coffee, rather than hops.  I can see why barrel aging this stout would make it incredible.  A couple of months to mellow out and pick up some sweet oak and vanilla flavors would make it incredible.  I cant wait to get my hands on this guys barrel aged cousin.","Washington, Washington DC, USA","Jonathan3584"

Absolutely no sign of the 12% alcohol.  An amazing sipper and a great nightcap!

Rerate based on the 2003 bottle shared by nolankowal at columbus tasting 3.0..  This brew is so much smoother and creamier with a little age... Im bumping this up to a 4.7 as the 4.4 I gave it originally was an underrating...","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"

It is a very pungent beer I smelled it the moment I popped the cap off of it.  Thick sharp alcohol taste at first but it quickly changes to a bitter chocolate coffee taste afterwards.

Very fine carbonation gives it a rich yet highly refined mouth feel which allows the flavors to come across intensely but not overwhelming or tiresome on the palate.  The 12% comes across as a very smooth, well-rounded  alcoholic edge.  This bottle has an aged flavor--a bit of sweetness and good bitterness--akin to dark chocolate--and a pronounced dark-roasted espresso flavor.  A very rich beer overall--alcoholic but smooth, and startlingly easy to drink.  This is the benchmark of the style.","San Diego, California, USA","Schultsc"

Flavor doesnt disappoint in the least with coffe and chocolate leading the way, behind it comes some light smoke, burnt toast, and the sweeter touches.  Whats different about this beer is the massive hops presence also there throughout.  Very nice smooth finish, perfect, not overly dry but definitely hoppy.  Alcohol becomes more and more noticable as the beer warms and begins to empty.

3442,"2005-05-18",5.0,"UPDATED: JUL 6, 2006 Five gallon party keg via AleSmith jockey box, my brothers wedding, July 2006.
Speechless.Silk-screened bottle, consumed January 2006.Opaque and black with a separated oiliness displaying at the edges when put to light.  No head, but there are some legs on the snifter from time to time.  Aroma is leaping off the charts.  Dark chocolate, burnt espresso roasters, dark chocolate milk (if such a thing exists,) vanilla, caramel currents and brown sugar.  The wafts are intoxicating, eventually revealing an unsweetened, sugarless iced mocha, sans ice, so as to not distort the bitter chocolate character.  Flavor is resilient in all dimensions.  Abrasive bitter sludge sluices through the taste buds.  Vanilla beans duke it out with said coffee beans, mashing and melding for a sweet bitter force thats cunningly sweet, solidified and righteously beautiful.  Oily sludge saturation, administering a waxy reconnaissance throughout.  Chewy malts, honed carbonation and fresh bitter extremities.  Caramel and dark chocolate traits are a given, but theyre a damn good reliable steed, and one that we shouldnt take for granted.  Quite the glow hanging to the tonsils in the finish, signaling its otherwise covert alcohol presence.  I told myself I wasnt going to rerate this batch, but it was far too moving and poetic not to.  Bless you AleSmith.
Labeled bottle, consumed May 2005.Black and opaque in appearance; moderately thick in viscosity.  Head is minimal at first but quickly diminishes to an oily overlay.  Bitterness jumps out of the gate first for aroma, along with unsweetened dark chocolate, mocha mousse and cafe o lait.  Coffee and roasted malts are definitely represented in this speed demon.  Alcohol is discernable in flavor.  Bitter chocolate and espresso flavors dominate.  Its like sucking on a handful of greasy, dark roasted espresso beans.  Body is oily and dense.  Malts seem to favor flavor over viscosity.  Definitely has its share of IBUs.  Moderate carbonation is probably livelier on the palate than in actuality because of the dactylic touch of alcohol.  Finish is warming, bitter and mouth watering.  While I served it at about 55 degrees as recommended on the bottle, I liked it better as it got even warmer, say 60-65 degrees.  At the higher temp, it seemed to thicken and improve its body.  Uber thanks to tpkenned for the bottle!","Washington Heights","StewardofGondor"

3442,"2005-05-04",4.7,"First of all, big thanks to ODeed on this one. It has been sitting in my cellar for several months waiting for just the right night to drink, and I guess this is the night. 750ml bottle, I peeled the foil back and popped the top. The beer is right at 55° after I placed it in the fridge from the cellar a couple hours ago. Served in my NB worthy glass. The beer pours black with a smallish and short lived (but it showed up)  light brown head that dies down to just a few bubbles and a haze.  When swirled, the beer coats the glass and leaves foam dots and streaks across the glass. The aroma is somewhat bitter, dark, roasty malts with a nice perfumy hop character to it. I smell some coffe, but not as much as I would have thought (this is a good thing.) The taste is dark, roasty malts, with sweet milk chocolate and bitter dark chocolate flavor and a mild coffee flavor along with some dancing floral hops. The coffee taste comes midway through and is strong for a second, but also fleeting. There is a hops bitterness, along with some nice hops flavor, before the coffee bitterness and flavor takes over for the finish. The mouthfeel is substantial, but not overly ""chewy."" I fully expected to be overwelhmed by the coffee, but once again, these huge, nicely balanced imperial stouts can take a lot off added, intense flavors, such as coffee, molasses, and bourbon. I cant wait to try the barrel aged version, I am normally not too keen on barrel aging, but I think this is an imperial that can take the boubon and wood and make it work. A world class imperial!","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Wonderful nose.  The texture and flavors of the beer coat your palate and dont let go.  Oily, and dense as the alcohol initially bights your tongue, next the dark roast (dark/burnt malts) flavors sooth you mouth and make you want to drink this all night.

GABF 2004.  Upon reflection, I wish that I would have spent more time at the Alesmith table.  This is a great stout, silky chocolate roast that seems like a Dove bar has melted in your mouth and transmogrified into glorious beer.  Full bodied.  The finish lingers nicely, with a touch of roasty driness.  Fresh hops undergird the chocolate, and some faint dusty plum flavors seep in occasionally too.  Looks exactly like an imperial stout should look, so no lost marks there.  Beautiful.  4.3.

Re-Rate: 750 bottle into tulip glass.  4/26/05.
This is still a great beer, but this bottled version is much more claustrophobic, the roast and coffee dominating and the mouthfeel staying sticky and chewy, almost too full.  There are also notes of dry tar in the finish that are less than enjoyable.  Not as great as I remembered it from GABF, so Ive knocked it down a couple of tenths.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","arjoseph"

Poured jet black with a medium fizzy brown head that dissipated quickly.  Aroma is delicious sweet chocolate and coffee.  Taste is mostly sweet, dominated by coffee with a hint of chocolate, with a roasted coffee bitterness.  The finish is bitter but not overwhelmingly so.  Theres an alcohol burn but the alcohol itself is nearly undetectable in the flavor, making this almost a little too drinkable. Rather impressive considering its 12%.  Not fruity at all.  Overall this is primarily a coffee stout, just turned up a notch.  The palate is nice and thick... not Kalamazoo thick, but thick enough.  Although Im not much of an Imperial Stout person (though I have yet to try the Dark Lord in my cellar), I find this beer to be very agreeable.  I could have this every day, but its too expensive for that, so Ill settle for once in a while.

Tons of dark burtness that is offset perfectly by the coffee beans.  It wasnt overly fruity like the dark lord and has just amazing flavors.  I could sip on this beer every night.  I cant even imagine how well its going to age.  This truly is liquid gold in the bottle.  It deserves every accolade it gets.  My new number 1 favorite.","Utah, USA","kbjames"

I popped the bottle and poured her in my tulip glass. This beer pours jet black with a fluffy tan head. Sweet chocolate, coffee aroma filled my kitchen as i poured this bad boy.  Sat down on my couch and sipped her slowly. Flavor is big chocolate and coffee, with a long lasting bitter hop taste. Hop kick reminds me of some Storm King. But this beauty is more thick and syrupy than Storm King. So, i finish my first glass, the rest is on the kitchen counter. My dumbass cat decides to sit on me when i have an empty glass. I hate to push her off me when she plunks down on me like that, but damn, i had some Speedway Stout on the kitchen counter. So she got the boot fairly quickly. Anyway, this beer gives Storm King a run for being the best Impy stout out there, IMO.

Despite this, there is ample brown head that lingers.  Amazing burnt and roasty aromas that every other Imperial dreams of.  In fact, the aromas and flavors seem to meld as one, a character of this beer that makes it so intriguing to me.  Licorice notes, caramelized maple sugar, plenty of hops shine throughout.

Opaque black with drown head that is rather quickly dissipating.  Boozy in the middle.  Start is sweet and vinous.  Middle is an astringent alcohol flavor.

3442,"2004-11-11",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 14, 2006 Appearcance: Dark as sin and twice as thick. Very little melted milk chocolate head that tantalizes you of the richness to come. 
Aroma: Coffee aroma even a coffee hater would love, followed by some premium dry dark chocolate. A hint of carmel?
Palate/Mouthfeel: Similar to the appearance, thick, full, velvety, almost like a melted milkshake. Its pure bliss.
Flavor: Starts with a kick of VERY fine coffee quickly followed by a smooth wave of delicious dark chocolate. Undertones of a slice of hop, a touch of carmel, and some delicious roasted malt. Something else, a touch of brown sugar? Maybe nutmeg? Delicious.
This is the king of beers, perhaps a little too rich to drink every day, but this an experience in and of itself.

Shared this in my beer tasting class. Glad I did as a little bit goes a long ways. Pours with no head at all. The body is a very viscous black that cling to the glass liek used oil. The aroms are rich with anise, grape juice and brown sugar. As it warms a little bit, it also has ome mushrooms. the mouthfeel is very thick. There are many flavors to pull out here. Has coffee and brown sugar. Also hints of vanilla and oranges add to the sweetness. The finish is dry like a cognac. Also has a warming alcohol presence. Very nicely done.

Aroma is a terrific blend of Coffee, molassas, chocolate and dark roasted malts. Flavor is mostly of the Espresso, and then less of the cohocolate.  Very smokey as well and a noticeable alcohol taste.  Feel is very smooth and silky. Carbonation is quite lively, but fine and soft at the same time.  Yes, quite strong dark smoke and coffee flavors as I continue to sip it.  Aftertaste is more mellow than I expected and short lived.
A Brew worthy of the top 10 and a great milestone rating.   Thanks to Footbalm for this one.","Boise, Idaho, USA","IndianaRed"
3442,"2004-10-30",4.0,"750 ml bottle, 2003.  Viscous black, opaque, tiny dark foamy head which disintigrates quickly into a small lasting ring.  Surprisingly subltle, mellow nose containing milk chocolate, coffee and brandy.  Mouthfeel gorgeously decadent at first, but underdone somewhat later by the too-sharp coffee bitterness, aided and abetted by tobacco ash and woodsmoke.  Alcohol fairly strongly present throughout, mostly welcome.  A light creme brulee character at the beginning is the only mediation of the tarry heaviness...I was a bit underwhelmed by this on the whole; its quality stuff, but I definitely think it could stand some aging to bring the mellower flavors to the fore.  As it is, a slightly above average example of the style as far as Im concerned.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
3442,"2004-10-28",4.2,"Pitch black in colour, completely opaque with no head at all. Some brown bubbles-but thats all.

Full-bodied; Sweet full chocolate flavour with some pungent coffee bitterness. Amazing how it rolls right off though-no offensive flavours at all!! Sweet, then alcoholic then roasty. A great aftertaste with no bad tastes. Overall, truly a great top 50! Well worth the long wait. I had wanted to drink this on graduation night from college, but it waited until now! An imperial stout that everyone should try-people could learn a few lessons about how a beer should be crafted!

<P>
Still a beautiful beer, but it definitely seems to have lost some of its grandness to my more educated palate. It was newer so hotter than I recalled which does detract a bit and seems to thin the brew. The coffee asspect is still large and well integrated, but it seems like the more beery stout asspects such as chocolate, roasted/burnt notes are less pronounced than I recall and overall it seems to lack the range of flavor of the first batches I had. 

Bottle. This is the eptiome of a stout in apperance. Rich black color with a frothed dark brown head. VERY strong coffee aroma. This looks like an esspresso writ large and the taste is similar.

Pours a very dark brown, virtually black, with a nice tan head with fair retention.  Great flavor as well.  Very nice strong coffee presence with some sweetness.  Roastiness and chocolate  make their presence known rather nicely, but the coffee is the dominant flavor.  Not a real strong alchohol presence in the finish that Ive had in other imperial stouts, which I strongly prefer.  Dont get me wrong, it is there, but never overpowering.   A very nice combination and balance of the flavors.    Very impressive.

Massive chocolate, maple, dark roasted espresso beans, sweetened condensed milk, pipe tobacco smokiness and alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium-thick. Aftertaste burns a little from the alcohol but still exudes an even balance of sweet chcolate malt and roasted hops. This one is truly a rare treat.

3442,"2004-10-03",4.3,"UPDATED: JAN 13, 2007 This beer was unbelieveable. 

It poured pitch black. The head: light tan in size with a mostly diminishing head that left some lacing.

Nice nose. Molasses and lots of toffee and coffee but mostly a sweet milk chocolate covered pot leaf that I loved.

Starts out with vanilla, toffee and tons of cocoa. The mid-palate was full of chocolate but not the usual chocolate but more of a melted milk chocolate. The finish was amazing and hard to put into words. It was a tobacco laden coffee bean dripping with chocolate and it was very lingering. The coffee beans served there purpose, molding all the flavors together and eliminating a lot of the alcohol flavors. This was a 12% beer and I could barely taste any alcohol and I think it was the coffee beans than eliminated it. 

This beer was amazing and the past few days I have been sitting in the middle of class and I could swear that I tasted the tobacco laden coffee bean dripping with chocolate finish.

The aromas were of chocolate and roasty malt when I first poured this, but as it warmed, the coffee started to emerge.  It was never overpowering enough to make me think of this as a coffee beer, but like it was just touched off with a little bit.  A very nice accent to this monster Imperial.  Silky smooth body.

There is quite a chalky feel to it at first, mainly from the alcohol.  But then there a whole lotta malt, a whole lotta coffee and a whole lotta roasted feel.

3442,"2004-09-20",4.4,"UPDATED: MAR 8, 2005 My second visit to this fine beer, which I believe is the same vintage 5 months later, was somewhat more fruitful a venture... Literally, the strong coffee flavor were backed up magnificently by a fruity raisin and dark chocolate backbone. Much more complex and even more drinkable. My compliments to this beer still stand. My criticism does not.

Original: So here it is, direct from Hi-Times wines mail order, the legendary Speedway Stout. Though, I find myself questioning why its so  legendary. Yes, its huge. Yes, its loaded with coffee and good old fashioned imperial stout flavor. Its quality sipper for sure--big, warming, well-covered alcohol, silky smooth mouthfeel, well-balanced--an expertly brewed beer. Trouble is: theres just not much going aside from coffee and a little bit more coffee. Its an excellent beer but it leaves me in a bit of a bind to rate it as its a bit--for the lack of a better word--boring. Ok. Simple might be better. Really, how much you like this beer is gonna depend on how much you like coffee. I like coffee a lot but I like beer better. High marks but not top marks. Good day.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Frank"

Coffee, chocolate and toasted marshmallows. Smooth coating palate is delivered to the tongue.

As the brew ejaculates itself out of the bottle into my tulip glass it reveals a deep obsidian color, with a substantial tan head.  The aroma wafts hungrily toward my olfactory glands, revealing itself with coffee, chocolate, cabernet, prunes, nuts, licorice.  The first sip reveals a plethora of flavors which drive my taste buds into orgasmic nirvana.  Tastes of the above aromas, and revealing velvety chocolate syrupy, cinnamon, hazlenut flavors after the repour.  This one had some elements of Brooklyn BC Stout, some elements of Stone RIP, and some elements of Old Heathen...even a tad of DFH Worldwide.  This beer is big, with well hidden alcohol, and perhaps the best aroma, complexity, and finish of any stout (or any beer for that matter) that I have ever had.  You must try this stuff.

Better as the bottle lowered. I was a little disappointed in this; it taste like a Expedition Stout with a little coffee added.","New Lenox, Illinois, USA","HopsOrDie"
3442,"2004-06-20",4.8,"Absolutely one of the best beers I’ve ever tasted.  The pour yields little head, but what is there is a tan/beige hue.  The aroma is heavily laden with dark, dark roasty malt and coffee.  The color is black as night.  The smooth texture is great, and the initial taste of choco-espresso coffee is nothing short of fabulous.  I wanted to sip this glass forever.  The bitter hop aftertaste was a nice finish to each mouthful.  Make no mistake, there’s a definite alcohol prescence, but it’s not a bad thing.  It’s just warms you a bit.  As the glass warms in your hands, all the wonderful quailities seem to be magnified.  I’ve got to get more.  I’m not sure I’ll be able to let my last bottle sit for long.","Panama City, Florida, USA","BrockLanders"

Flavor adds to the above with roasted mocha notes, anise, and a bit of dark fruit.  Hop bitterness shines midway through to provide balance.

However, instead of conflicting and becoming muddled I found this to be balanced quite well, even with the higher ABV, which was noticable but not distracting.  Had to sip on this one for a while.

This stuff is dark! I held a flashlight up to the glass and no light penetrated.
Medium sized dark brown head that disipates quickly and leaves behind a patchy, chunky lace.
Aroma was rubbing alcohol and coffee. maybe a little prune juice in there.
Flavor is milk chocholate, coffee and dark fruit with a sweet caramel finish. 

Surprisingly soft and smooth for a beer so high in ABV. kind of went down like a kahlua and cream. or a chocholate milk with chocholate syrup, heavy cream, coffee and a shot of everclear.

Flavor is also huge, thick and chocolatey, figs and currents, coffee, an alcohol kick and a nice bitter finish that lingers.  Thick body, soft carbonation and smooth despite the massive ingredients.

Also coffee, sweet dark roasted malt, mocha and a fine balance of alcohol. Yummi! Flavor is just as delicious. Extremely soft, complex and full-bodied with notes of chocolate, fruit, malt, hops and lots of coffee (espresso). A thick mouthful but not as cloying as Dark Lord.

3442,"2004-04-22",4.5,"Special Thanks to Gusler for this one, the positive beer karma around that guy is probably swirling like a cloud of fresh hops!

Poured absolutely pitch black with very, very little carbonation and an oily like pattern of film residing on the top of the glass.

Aroma is heavily roasted with chocolate malts and definite java notes. Also some distinctly rich notes of nuts, so rich in fact its like peanut butter. Slightly peppery leather also.

Flavor starts off heavy with roasted flavors which subside for a time to rich chocolate notes. That rich nutty tone that I detected on the nose also comes into play in the middle part of the experience. It's a really intriguing nutty flavor too, something like a warm unsalted almond. The finish is distinctly dark roast coffee grounds.

Mouthfeel is maybe a touch thin but is cool with a slick, oily sensation which I enjoyed.

Overall feeling is that this is a tremendous brew worthy of much praise. I am thankful to have received it, and will be looking forward to the next time I have an opportunity to hoist one of these, Thanks Joe!","Champaign, Illinois, USA","jables"

3442,"2004-04-14",4.7,"An Imperial stout that's also brewed with coffee? This must be the beer designed just for me! 
Dark as the blackest night, with a head that, on this pour, stays small, but lasts for the duration as a fine, brown-tinged ring.
Aroma is thick and viscous, a twisted, motor-oily smell, wrapped up in licorice, molasses, dark rum. Deeep, dark, delectably intoxicating. Potent stuff, wicked, but delicious: I love it!
Taste: an intensive barrage boards the senses, thick, chewy, immense, the flavor quickly dominates the senses, slays any opposition, rearranges the furniture, makes itself completely at home in the mouth. There's a new King in the Castle! Devastating! Amazing!
Coffee flavor is there, for certain, but isn't dominant, rather it seems to be the skeleton that holds this incredible flavor together. And a never-flagging flavor it is, too, every element continue to roll luxuriantly in the mouth. I was in a state of beery blissdom, brought on by this bottle.
Alcohol is so well-concealed by the flavor, it's largely unfelt until halfway through the bottle. And I made a mistake, not realizing that it's a whopping 12%, until I was well into it. My sobriety took a definite hit in this sampling!
A most impressive stout. If I were a very good boy indeed, I'd love to sink into one of these every night, as my reward","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Pigfoot"

3442,"2004-03-22",3.9,"UPDATED: NOV 28, 2004  Blind Tasting, Thanks tiggmtl  Pitch black pour with almost no head. Aroma consists of an hazelnuty malt profile with coffee and dark swiss chocolate notes. Very intense grapefruity hops also come into play in here. Palate is dry altogether. Taste is very hoppy, grapefruity although alcohol shows more and more as it warms, then it becomes more on the vinous side. Medium to full bodied, silky, round mouthfeel. Warming for sure, but definitely not close to my expectations. In fact, in the blind tasting, I never came close to guessing this was the speedway. I expected it to burst in my face with coffee flavors and frankly, this doesnt have so much coffee flavors, its in fact only in my notes regarding the aroma and I insisted far more on the hazelnut. That being said, after the 10th imperial stout, I was sure the last one (11th) would be the speedway, it passed that anonym. It remains very well done though with all the elements you look for in an impy including a big roasty character, but youve got to be in the mood for alcohol and a very long west-coast hoppy aftertaste. My friends, without being chauvinist, this aint no Péché Mortel. In fact, next time I have the Péché Mortel, I expect to raise its rating some..  Resample many months later. This is a bit better than I remembered. I got a bit more coffee flavors, but its not particularly expressive, not so complex, but very well made for its size, good full body, firm roastiness.

The espresso-laced goodness was the favorite of all three at my table (out of dozens of world class beers) Coming from a non-coffee drinker (typically too bitter for me), this is a high compliement.

The first sip was delicious and brought gourmet black coffee and Kahlua, bittersweet Mexican chocolate, some nuttiness, and a roasty aftertaste. Big fat full body that is greased by alcohol. Paired wonderfully with melon, chocolate, and cheese. Best in small quantities however because the coffee elements overpower after awhile.

No light escapes this beer whatsoever. Straight slam into my stout glass only produces a slight medium brown head. It does leave a decent lacing, but the head is very thin. Aromas right off the bat are of coffee, roasted malts, alcohol, biscuity, yeasty aromas as well.
Slight aromas of piney hops are way off in the background. Rich mouthfeel, thick and viscous. Tastes are of expresso, and french roasted coffees. Thick malts back up the coffee, and the hops make a slight appearance towards the end. Sort of like drinking strong coffee, with a shot of whiskey in it. Alcohol is very warming, but not overpowering in it's presence. Slight charcoal finish to it. Finishes dry as a bone. Outstanding effort on Alesmiths part.
Alcohol tastes are well hidden. This beer is dangerously drinkable.","","Cobra"

Although the flavors are intense, propelled by the 12% ABV, this beer isnt particularly complex.  But it is quite intense.  Perfect for watching the snowflakes fall, which is the reason this beer wasnt save for #500.  And I had to get that PBR taste out of my mouth.   RERATE:  11 years later, a trip down memory lane.

Aroma is just kicking...the normal roasted chocolate and espresso malts are there, but there is just something remarkably different about them than I am used too - the chocolate smells buttery, like a milkshake and the coffee smells wonderfully fresh, which comes to no surprise when glancing at the brewing process. This is quite possibly the chewiest beer I've had...ever. If there were some way I could give the palate here a six I would, I caught myself literally chewing while drinking this as though it were a wheatgrass smoothie or a milkshake or something, just enormous. The flavor is everything that's been said here already plus some butter and just amazing cloying chewiness. What an awesome beer. I don't know if I could handle the oak-aged version, simple as that.

3442,"2004-01-12",4.2,"UPDATED: APR 21, 2006 Pours black in color with a brief brown head that diminishes to a thin coat of bubbles.  Figgy-alcohol nose layered on top of coffee bitterness.  The initial flavor is unfortunately mostly alcohol but with some roasted malt flavor.  The middle and finish are quite good, having a sweet liquor taste (w/o the alcohol) on top of very smooth coffee.  Im going to detract from this beer because of the strong alcohol notes in the start.  The rest of the taste was really good, but the alcohol reminds me of hard liquor.

Re-rate 4/21/2006.  Roast barley and coffee bean roast garnishing a chocolately-sweet foundation with light rasin/plum highlights.  Smells like chocolate dosed with coffee.

Well this was the last of the 4 different 750ml bottles BeanDip and I had on our Sunday rate-a-thon and I had a fat bastard buzz working by this point. However I will be in the minority here when I say that I was not as impressed with this Mammoth Imperial as I was expecting to be. It was a dame fine quality Imperial Stout but it was a bit too bitter with the immense notes of coffee, just not very complex IMO. All I found with in the tar like body and finely packed caramel colored head was Espresso, Espresso, Espresso, and some roasty but lingering sweet notes toffee, actually a bit acidic with all the dark coffee notes. I did pick up on some notes of chared oak, anis  and caramelized sugars but overall it seemed rather one-dimensional to me.
 I did enjoy the beer; Very Much, but it was lacking the invigorating qualities I was anticipating. Well I suppose I will have to again trade someone on the West Coast for another bottle of SpeedWay and see what more I can pull out of this Imperial Coffee brew.

Still a little head on this beast, but not much.  Dark, dark brown opaque body, almost black in color.  Surprisngly thin-looking body for an imperial stout, but otherwise just what you'd expect in a top-shelf imperial.  Nose is oaky-- very nice, but a little strongly alcoholic and brown sugary.  Flavors of coffee, darkly burnt, and malt, with slightly mellowing sweetness.  There's a bit of a sour edge that I'm not totally crazy about that keeps this one from being the phenomenal beer that I'd hoped, but it's pretty great nonetheless.  Finish is great, very long and very active, drying and powerfully coffee-centered.  As good as this was, I think I actually enjoy the 2003 fresh bottles that I've had a bit more than this aged one, because it feels like the aged is in a bit of a transition phase-- some of the strength has diminished a bit, but some strong flavors still linger, and they're not the ones I'd want to have up front.","Tujunga, California, USA","cquiroga"

It is quite thick, this is definitely a sipping brew.  Luckily, despite its thickness, this beer is not syrupy, which I don't really like in a beer.  Definitely tastes of coffee, with chocolate and alcohol in the finish.  Reminds me of a good creamy dark chocolate bar.  A definite malty sweetness is here, it is controlled by the roast flavors though.  A certain restrained fruitiness is here, the closest analogy would be burnt raisin.  This is quite good, and though I was disappointed at first, the carbonation is just about perfect for this heavy beer.

3442,"2003-10-26",4.6,"UPDATED: DEC 1, 2005 2003 bottle Coincidentally, I think the last super-hyped beer that lived up to my expectations was Bells Expedition.  And there were many similarities.  However, this one was more creamier and malted, with lots more cofee.  Aroma was amazing, smelled like a nice mocha latte, with some alcohol.  Some hops aroma as well.  I was also impressed with the ultra black opaque appearance AND a nice lasting coffee colored head.  Commences with a velvety smooth coffee/chocolate malt flavor, super creamy texture, hardly any carbonation, coffee is not overdone.  Full body and just when I am hoping for the hops to balance it, they do.  Finishes with a mix between roasted malt, dry hops and a punch of alcohol, moderately bitter.  The alcohol is so well masked and though you can definitely tell its there on the finish, it does not interrupt the body whatsoever.  I swirled this beer around in my mouth and it was just perfect, so many malty flavors and just so wonderfully balanced.  This one is incredible and really dosent even seem to need to be cellared (whereas Expedition comes off as quite young).  This is as close to perfect as it gets.  Maybe could use a little less bitterness on the finish, as the strong coffee, dry hops and alcohol pack a huge wallop that really shocks you coming off of the mellow, velvety body.  But hey, I think it just adds character, hard to really find much fault here.  Thanks again for the trade Bob.  Rerate.  After having Dark Lord, the magic of this is slightly paled, but its still fantasticly world class stuff.2005 bottle sampled 10/27/2005 with SuIIy.  Wow.  Its hard to believe this is a young impy stout.  No edge on this at all.  Exquisite appearance, mouthfeel and aroma.  Superbly balanced.  I never noted too much coffee in the least.  I might even like this more than the 2003.  Perhaps not as complex and powerful, but what it lacks in that, it makes up in sheer enjoyable flavor and balance.  Raising the score a bit.  9/5/10/5/182003 bottle aged between 26-30 months  Aging stouts with huge amounts of real coffee in them has not seemed to work out greatly.  I think controlling the effect of the coffee over time is very difficult to predict and does have odd reactions with the rest of the beer.  That being said, this was still very respectably preserved.  The body had thinned out considerably and the carbonation was very low.  Alcohol was too prevalent, while malt sweetness seemed much much less than when young.  I had cellared this very carefully the whole way, but I think this one just dosent last that long, or rather, is better drunk fresh.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

The finish is great, alcohol for about .8 seconds then a solid mocha/expresso finish until whenever you rinse your mouth out. I wish coffee would taste this good!

Reminds me a lot of a very good columbian coffee. Very good! Coffee, coffee and coffee in the flavour. Heavy roastyness and chocolate as well. ""Totalt i orden smag."" Has a awesome aftertaste.

Seems somewhat ordinary as far as imp stouts are concerned.  Had on tap at Pizza Port - Solana Beach. Excellent black-as-night body with excellent chocolate brown head. Aroma is similar to a fresh espresso. Taste is coffee and dark, sweet fruit. Very creamy. Nice bitter and alcohol finish that balances well with the strong roasted coffee flavors. One of my favorites.","California, USA","unclebleen"
3442,"2003-10-12",3.1,"I am a big fan of stouts, especially Imperials.  But not this one.  The coffee is almost astringent in flavor and overpowering.  Teh beer is pitch black and pours with a deep dark brown head.  Te first sip is way somewhat silky and chewy and it seems to be on its way to a nice experience until the astringency sets in.  Very bitter and dry leaving an odd flavor in the back of the throat. Not terrible but not what I expected.","Palos Heights, Illinois, USA","EddieG"
3442,"2003-10-02",3.2,"Pitch-black; 1mm ring of deep-brown 'head'. Nose of concentrated coffee, tarry - both as in rubber, but also as in Lapsang Souchong tea, dry-freezed, then. This is a tar-suspension by way of beer. Tastes like concentrated Turkish coffee, or like coffee-candies - much coffee, little candy. As, said, concentrate - the mouthfeel is in accordance.

3442,"2003-09-21",4.5,"Thanks to BeerLimey for the trade. This definitely fits the bill as a Big Beer. Pours almost sludge-like out of the champagne bottle. Thick and black with a miniscule beige head. Next to no lacing. The aroma is all roasted coffee. The body is big and bold and the flavors of coffee, bitter chocolate and warming alcohol really pack a whollop. It never becomes too much though. The beer remains smooth throughout. This is one of those beers that you wouldn't know was 12% by the flavor, only by the effect. The finish is dry and slightly bitter. Superb.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","Dogbrick"

Nice amount of lacing on the glass.  Rich and painfully inviting with massive coffee and chocolate notes. Underneath the huge malt aroma is one of fresh, green hops. A hint of alcohol hides way under the surface, somewhere in the muck... Absolutely outstanding aroma.  The overall flavor is huge with the mammoth coffee, burnt caramel, roasted grain, and chocolate malt flavors beautifully balanced with a prodigious amount of fresh hops.  Each sip is an explosion on the palate, with the malt sweetness and hop bitterness fighting for supremacy. There's a touch of alcohol, but it's really well hidden for a 12% brew. Finishes with the one-two punch of coffee and green hops. Positively sublime...  Thick and chewy with a lush, round mouthfeel. This is carbonated motor oil.

Thanks to Aofoxxy or jsquire, or BBB - I can't remember who woke me from my ""beernap"" in time to try this, but I owe you in any case.  Pours as black as the spot in my chest where my heart should be.  The head is creamy and brown, but thin without much lacing.  The nose is huge with flowers, alcohol, chocolate, licorice and perfume.  The flavor is very complex and hard to pin down.  A warm sweetness weaves its way through the depths to stroke your palate softly.  Balance is exceptional.  The thick and rich body is flat and finishes very dry.

I've had 3 sips and I'm loopy and full. This is seriously like drinking very tasty motor oil. It poured black as night with NO head. This beer has no carbonation. Beer? What am I talking about? This is friggin port, or sambuca, or some other kind of thick after dinner sipper. Certainly nothing I should be drinking 750ml of! Tastes big time of coffee... I dont even like coffee! Black licorice, unsweetened chocolate, wow, more coffee. I made the mistake of taking my first swig while walking and almost dropped the whole glass- the taste is simply staggering!

3442,"2003-07-15",4.1,"Dark-side-of-the-moon blackness with just a thin ring of tan head clinging for life against the glass. Fresh, intense and inviting nose told me immediately that this beer meant business. I didn't hesitate -- I've waited too long to try this bastard -- and chugged a big gulp. Now, I've never sipped motor oil before, but this is how I'd imagine the texture to be. After swallowing, I recalled a time when I was young and chewing on a mouthful of black licorice. My saliva kept building up because my mouth wouldn't stop watering. It eventually turned into a black syrup of intense bitterness and sweetness, with an oily residue about it -- this beer is like that. It's extremely creamy and weighty on the tongue. Malts exude a cornucopia of flavors ... bitter chocolate, burnt toast, roasted malts, sharp coffee and maybe even some plum, raisin and fig. Extremely hoppy, almost to the point of being electrified -- zingy and sharp with a bitterness that resides on the tongue well into the following day. Alcohol was very warming and sharp at times, though masked well behind the thick, syrupy-sweet malts and intensely bitter/acidic hops. This is a BIG beer in every which way. Definitely a ball-grabbing, attention-getting beer. I loved it.","Bellingham, Washington, USA","Aubrey"
3442,"2003-07-11",4.5,"Rating #200
Here it is!  The infamous Speedway Stout.  This was the smoothest Imperial I've had the pleasure to sip.  Poured dark, molasses-like, with a thin tan head.  Aroma was potent coffee, dark, roasted malts and alcohol.  Flavor, like the aroma, was an astounding blend of coffee, chocolatey sweet roasted malts, molasses, licorice and warming alcohol.  This is one of those beers that requires constant sipping to ascertain its complexity.  My only complaint is that the alcohol was a bit harsh, especially after the first few sips.  I would have preferred that element to be toned down, but this is an exquisite stout regardless.","Traverse City, Michigan, USA","Silphium"
3442,"2003-07-07",4.7,"UPDATED: JUN 29, 2005 After lifting the cap off of this green 750ml bottle, vigorous pouring yielded a dense tan frothy head the width of my pinky finger. This deep ebony brew settled nicely into its stylish looking Alesmith pint glass sporting an etched logo on clear glass. The aroma wafting upwards was of an intense roasted malt, heavy with notes of coffee and alcohol. The texture of this stout is incredibly smooth, possibly the smoothest, creamiest stout Ive had. The flavor is deep, dark, and delicious. Coffee, bitter chocolate and a warming alcohol sensation leaves the finish only slightly dry with a hint of bitterness. This is one hell of a big stout. Full of flavor and strong, yet remarkably easy to drink. This stout will not dissapoint. Kick back with some soothing sounds and enjoy the ride. I plan on putting one of these away for next winter to see how it improves.

3442,"2003-06-27",4.2,"Poured deep black with the slightest brown coloring at the edges.  No head.  Appeared to have a thin layer of thin liquid on top of near sludge.  Extremely thick, with a full mouthfeel.  The aroma started as that of a good Imperial Stout, roasted malts, vinous, slight hops, chocolate, burnt toast and a little coffee.  However, as it was allowed to breathe, the coffee became more and more intense.  Virtually dominating the nose.  Full on flavor in the mouth, the coffee provided a roasted bitterness that made up for the seemingly lack of hops in the flavor.  Thick, tasty and full, this was a good beer and a nice experience.  However, it was not as mindblowing as I had anticipated.  Apparently this year's batch is not quite as nice as previous years.  It was still a wonderful experience that could not have occurred without the extreme generosity of Trappist Ales Rule.  A wonderful man whose passion for beer is only topped by his generosity, sincerity, and friendliness.  Cheers, Good Buddy!","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"
3442,"2003-06-24",4.6,"UPDATED: JAN 1, 2004  Sampled from 52 deg to 63 deg F.
Deep, dark black color with an equally dark brown head...started big and quickly diminished to a small, tight size. The aroma was full of rich, strong coffee, non-dairy dark chocolate, campfire ashes, alcohol (blended well) and some slight fruitiness. The flavor was equally impressive...very similar to the aroma but a bit more chocolaty with an added strong black licorice character. This is perhaps the most impressive stout I've ever tasted, and my only criticism (and I'm being really picky) was that the alcohol burn in the finish seemed out of place. The aroma and flavor were so rich, full, and strong that the alcoholic finish seemed unecessary. The feel was thick, oily, and yet still crisp on the tongue. Outstanding brew...well worth the wait, and living up to all my expectations. Thank you Bob for this awesome opportunity.  By the way, I like this label. Maybe it's the Indianapolis, IN in me (ya know...Indy 500) or the reference to motor oil, or the reference to being the champion of some big race, but I think this fits this beer perfectly. This beer really is the winner. AWESOME!!!","Clovis, California, USA","loweredsixth"
3442,"2003-06-19",4.7,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2003 Probably the best imperial stout I've had.  I could smell the chocolate as soon as I started pouring it.  I've been drinking a lot of Stone imperial stout lately and this is much better.  Much smoother with more of a chocolate/raison flavor.  To bad it's about twice as expensive as the Stone.  Don't be scared away by the price.  If you're a true imperial stout fan, you have to try this at least once.  ReRate:  I just had a Fuller's Porter and was very impressed with it.  I drank this right after and this wow'd me.  I think I said Rogue double choc stout is like Young's Double Coc Stout on Steroids.  Speedway stout is like Rogue choc stout on steroids.

Flavors are mainly of coffee, but there are also lots of chocolate, toffee, roasted malts, vanilla and cherries. Its amazingly complex and the flavors are at the same time very separate and blend well together in an amalgam of flavors. Extremely smooth. Excellent sipping beer. Hides the 12% alcohol very well.

The Shit Speedway Stout

Thanks again to Peter Zien and crew for this amazing beer. This Imperial stout pours a deep black color from the tap. A medium sized tan foamy head, with nice retention and good lacing. The aroma is coffee, some more coffee, some chocolate and some vanilla. A full bodied Imperial stout. The malts are roasty, with lots of chocolate and coffee flavors, add on top of that a very smooth mellow coffee flavor. Hints of vanilla at the finish. This is the coffee stout of coffee stouts.

3442,"2003-04-09",4.5,"UPDATED: AUG 2, 2006 2003 Bottle: (9,4,8,5,17), sampled on  2/15/04: Pours with very little head, but with a thick oily black body.  Aroma is still a rich complex mix of coffee, chocolate, and dark fruits.  Body is slightly more bitter and dry than the 2002 version, with more coffee presence.  Still has a great robust syrupy mouthfeel and good amount of sweetness.  Still a world class imperial stout.

My 500th rating: (9,5,9,5,19) 2002 bottle, sampled on 4/9/2003: Pours a deep brown molasses with full dark tan head.  Smells like walking into a Starbucks.  Rich chocolate coffee nose.  First sip is velvety sweet with a light touch of brown sugar and dark chocolate.  Great complexity is buried in its viscosity.  Medium bitterness and a roasted coffee finish round out one of the best imperial stouts Ive had.  This rivals dark lord and worldwide 18%.  Masks its alcohol masterfully.  I cannot wait until this years batch!","Columbia, Maryland, USA","CaptainCougar"
3442,"2003-03-31",4.0,"UPDATED: APR 30, 2003 (2002 Edition) The beer poured out of the bottle with a steady glug, glug, sound that was almost comical. However, the end result was a beer that is jet black with a thick creamy russet head. The nose screams melting dark chocolate and caramel sprinkled with coffee. The palate while very full is a little lighter than I was expecting. The coffee and dark malts meld greatly and produce one very chocolaty brew. The hop profile, certainty plays a supporting role in this malt bomb.  The coffee aspect of this beer comes on strong during the finish. To me this beer is a dessert beer all the way. I really enjoyed it, but it lacks the complexities of Victory, Stone, and Bells Imperial Stouts.","Baltimore, Maryland, USA","HighGravity"
3442,"2003-03-18",4.8,"If you could compare Speedway with a life-experience, I would match it with love. Its just impossible not to get involved after catching a whiff of the incredibly complex roasted and spicy flavors. Just a sip of the mocha, caramel and dark citrusy flavor satiates, but the hunger is there for more. After I thought I knew everything there was to know about the brew, more was to be learned. As with love, age only refines and develops what we first thought perfection was. I'd love to grow old with a bottle of Speedway.

The coffee and chocolate flavors dominate.  Pretty smooth for 12%.  Hints of caramel with a snappy finish.  The taste gets bigger on the last half of the glass.

A sinful, opaque black that is so powerful it bends light in its direction and absorbs it. Fluffy, creamy, cocoa colored head. Velvety smooth. The 12% alcohol is only barely noticeable. Chocolate aroma that made my stomach growl. The strong coffee aroma present in the bottle version was greatly subdued. Beautiful, rich mouth feel. Delicious chocolate, coffee, and vanilla flavors. None of the coffee acidity present in the bottle version (when first released). The bottle version has a much more pronounced, intense, quality coffee flavor. Each has its pluses. I havent had any of the bottled version since it was first released, but I imagine it is aging well. Id rate the bottled version only slightly lower.

Oh man, silky smooth, INTENSE flavors of bittersweet chocolate caramel ,alcohol, coffee beans and cocoa powder. Full, rich, intense and sharp. Nice long bitter finish, a bit drying as well. I didnt notice many burnt fruit impressions, notably some raisons and plums. This is a HUGE beer and one not to be taken lightly.  I feel it may need some time to age so it can mellow and meld a bit.

After all was said and done Alesmith has done it again, completely winning my heart and my support at the Strong Ale Festival in San Diego with their Whiskey Barrel Casked Speedway Imperial Stout. Unbelievable!!! Aroma is OVERFLOWING with coffee and a smack in the face of mocha! It pours a menacing black with a good lingering head (or perhaps it lingered only long enough for me to gobble this down). The taste was so unique...chocolate, mocha, coffee, warming yummy alcohol, wood from the cask...simply stunning. It left a good dry palate, but damned if i couldnt almost chew the caffiene!!! Im stunned and very satisfied!

RERATE 01/06/03: Aroma of chocolate, vanilla, alcohol, wood, and candy. Pour is jet black with a viscous dark brown/orange head that lasted a matter of minutes. Good bourbon and oak flavors dominate, with chocolate and coffee undertones slagging the tongue! A train of dry sugar completes the ending of this joygasmic wonder. I therefore jump my rating from 4.5 to 4.6

Deep Black in color the Malty quality and medium IBUs impress the tongue far beyond the shocking high quality coffee bean flavor.

A very complex imperial stout.
The beer is midnight black with  an average sized, creamy, light brown, fully lasting head. Excellent lacing. The aroma was of dark chocolate, mild coffee and heavily roasted malt. The nice addition of hops of hops also came through lightly in the nose and was that a hint of prune?  Initially, the flavor is slightly sweet and moderately bitter. Lightly acidic and a touch sour on the back side. A full, creamy mouthfeel with lively carbonation and a very dry finish. One of my all time favorite stouts.

Even half-empty, this bottle must weigh about 7 pounds.  750ml of 12% stout...I almost feel like Im inflicting this beer on myself, hehe.  Im very surprised to discover that the bottle is green, but the foil and label do cover most of it.  Color is solid, light-defying ebony with a lasting, light brown head.  Aroma is indeed promising, caramel/toffee, roasty, chocolate malt and espresso, with a hint of the alcohol.  Flavor further expounds upon the concept devised by the aroma, with the toffee becoming a bit more evident, a vague hint of that classic imperial dark fruitiness (more apparent once the beer warms a bit), turkish coffee, chocolate syrup and an excessive quantity of roasted malt.  Heavy, lusciously creamy   mouthfeel.  Finish is a bit drier than the rest of the beer.  Alcohol certainly provides a warming effect, deep down in your chest.  Wow.

Best head Ive had in awhile (HEH HEH HEH!).. and simply looks amazing when poured.
BUT.. while the flavors are complex, and it has a rich deep flavor, Im not one of those people (and there are many MANY on this site) that think more flavor, or STRONGER flavor, is always a good thing.
Also, call me a girlscout, but the ABV wasnt incorporated well.. and this was just a bit overwhelming.
Perhaps I drank it the wrong way.. perhaps it was a bad bottle, perhaps the conditions werent right. Ill give it another shot soon just to make sure.. but as for right now, I cannot recommend it highly.
A great beer, but I expected more after seeing the ratings.
Better than Ayinger dopple? Never.","Paris, FRANCE","Dionysian"
3442,"2002-07-23",4.6,"Very deep and dark brown color (not black, but extremely dark). Pours with very big, tightly carbonated head - dark tan in color. Medium strength nose (expected it to be a bit more aromatic), roasted coffee and dark chocolate. Big and bold flavors - leans heavily towards the roasted coffee side, but also notes of bakers chocolate and very light hops. Big bittersweet finish. Very smooth finish!! I checked the ABV after the bottle was empty and was floored that its 12% - this is smooth stuff. So whats better - Stone IP or Speedway? Well Speedways flavor certainly favors the coffee notes, while Stone is more complex in the fact that there are more flavors going on (no winey malt notes in the Speedway as opposed to the Stone IP). Speedway had a pretty light nose for such a big beer. Its a close race, but Id give the narrow edge to Stone. My top tier of IPs are at 4.8 (Stone IP, DFH WW included) - Speedway is just a touch outside at 4.6.","Orange County, California, USA","bigal9699"

Fortunately this isnt the case (I gave it a solid but not superb score at last months blind tasting, but given that it was the 22nd imperial stout of the night, i suspect my taste buds were seriously impaired at the time).  If there was one thing about this beer that I would change, its that it needs to be available in the DC area.  (9/4/9/5/18)

3442,"2002-07-17",4.8,"UPDATED: APR 26, 2004 This is a great great beer.  I found 2 bottles left at a local liqour store, so I thought I'd try seeing as though it's creeping up on the arrogant bastard IMperial stout.  Now... since hey_kevin did a great job describing the brew, I will compare this and arrogant bastard.  The first ntable comment is the price.  This bottle was 9.99 compared to arrogant bastard which was about 4 dollars, but is about 3/4 the size of this guy.  The alcohol content is another thing.  THis has 12% alc. compared to arrogants 9.65 whatever it is.  Now comes to taste.  Arrogant bastards Imp. stout is smooth as anything which a nice chocalaty finish, not so much a coffee flavor.  This beer here has coffee beans added during conditioning, so you bet there is gonna be some nice chocolaty flavor.  Now to decide which is better.... both are damn fine beers.  I still have a few bottles of aroogant bastard, and I will rerate if neccessary, but for the time being, these 2 brews will be on the top of my list.

3442,"2002-07-14",4.8,"Oh god, is this ever an experience.  The 750 was divided into 2 1/2 duvel tulips, each poured after the previous was consumed.  Pours black as the ace of spades.  Just the right level of carbonation, enough to brighten and sharpen the flavors, but not so much that it makes a carbonic/dry ice burn.  Strong alcohol in the aroma, as well as roasted grain and coffee early on and hops and roasted red peppers later.  The first glass I had was poured at about 45 degrees,  at this temp it seemed a little disjointed, roasty and alcoholic, with coffee in the background, but just 10 minutes later and a few degrees warmer the coffee comes up, way up.  I can feel the alcohol in this first glass.  In the second glass, the aroma of alcohol is more prominent, yet every sip is luxurious.  And the bitter end, the final half duvel tulip is utter freakin beer-vana.  I was literally groaning with pleasure after each of the final sips.  An amazing drinking experience.  My only slight criticism is that at times it shows a little too much alcohol, but I think one would be naive to expect a beer that is 12% alcohol not not show a little alcohol.  It would be my wet dream to someday sample this beer on handpump.  Real ale festival guys?","Decorah, Iowa, USA","heykevin"

Finish is moderately sweet, lightly acidic, moderately bitter. Full body, syrupy texture, lively carbonation, moderately to heavily alcoholic. Ah, how far Alesmith has fallen...this used to be their only remaining good beer once Skip left, and now this too has turned into utter mediocrity.  So very sad.  Nose is pleasant enough, but mostly chocolate syrup / chocolate milk mixed with coffee...very little nuance or depth.  And the mouth experience is quite syrupy sweet now with not enough to balance.

The aroma is spectacular, but all other characteristics seem concealed within.  The appearance is a sheer delight that includes plentiful carbonation and a velvety mouthfeel.  Mild roast lies beneath the stacks of bittersweet chocolate, Ryan Bros. coffee, and burnt malts.  Long finish of dark chocolate-coated espresso beans. Awesome stuff. 2003  What happened?  Nowhere near the same brew.  The aroma and flavors no longer boast the elegant coffee flavors. Moreover, the mouthfeel is far less than velvety and much thinner.
