784,"2008-11-20",4.2,"I enjoyed the Schlafly Oktoberfest, so I was eager to try this, as it was suggested by the manager of the liquor store.

Medium tan head. Cloudy, toffee in color.

Wheat, spices and fruit in the nose. Very neutral mouthfeel. Not much going on for all the things you smell, and it’s over quickly.

For such little going on in the mouth, the finish is complex, with the bitter hops balanced nicely by the wheat and spices (cloves or all spice?).

Very drinkable. I’m sure I’ll purchase a case of this when I visit the liquor store next.","Evansville, Indiana, USA","RickS95"

Aroma is almost all bananas and is very ester heavy with a slight citrus aroma.  Flavor upfront is very dominate of bananas, bitterness in the middle from the hops and finishes with a slight apple cider taste and a very nice alcohol flavor.

Some hints of spice, but that of a tin that has set in my mothers cupboard for far too many years. A wheat field surrounded by a flower garden, as light sweet wheat and mild sweet flowers are the first thoughts. Bland comes to mind the rest of the way through. Some very, very mild spice and wheat bread flavors in the finish and short linger. I think this is a good example of a wheat beer brewed with a standard ale yeast producing an a boring american dunkelweizen.

Aroma has a decent spice to it, which really came out in the initial taste.  Schlafly explained the additive was coriander, but I tasted more of a bubblegum and citrus fruit sweetness to it.

A: Pours a nice looking copper/orange color with a stark white head. Goes away quickly but leaves some nice lacing.

S: Wow, this beer pretty much smells overwhelmingly like ripened bananas, so if you like that thing, thisll smell go to you.

T: A rather subtle beer, though there is a sour tartness to it that has me wondering if Ive gotten an ""off"" bottle or not. A nice sweet breadiness beneath that saves the day though, and leaves a tasty short finish.

M: Like many in the weiss world, this beer has a crisp, light, well-carbonated feel to it.

Aroma is comprised of a blend of softly sweet, milky caramel and dark wheat malts along with German-style yeast attributes, providing plenty of spicy clove and some lighter banana esters, and features some faint lemon-like citrus, honey and earthiness underneath.  Hazy dark amber color, with a lasting, fine, creamy, off-white head and a dusting of greyish sediment.  Rather well-balanced flavors here, with a toasty, sweet malt presence, abundantly spicy yeast character and a gentle citric tinge, finishing surprisingly long with a hint of chocolate.

Moderate carbonation and malty crisp, velvety smooth medium bodied mouthfeel, again, very nice.

Delicious tasting, clove and banana at first, followed by the wheat malts, as it warms the coriander and orange peel start to come out, a light spiciness towards the end and a yeasty, malty finish.

784,"2006-10-30",3.7,"On tap at the brewpub - soon to be a year round in bottles according to the staff.  Poured dark hazy amber with a moderate tan head.  Aroma had dark rich wheat with a light sweetness.  Medium body with a rich feel at the beginning and a fairly crisp finish.  There is a small amount of carbonation.  Taste starts with rich wheat, some orange hidden underneath for a touch of citrus flavor.  It is quite smooth, but there are some crisp characteristics.  The finish brings out cloves that complement the other flavors quite well.  A bit more citrus starts showing through.  The carbonation it does have accentuates the clove and citrus.  Further down I detected a bit of a papery taste on the finish - this was the only negative I had with the beer and it wasnt a very dominant flavor.  This is a well done and unique beer from the St. Louis staple.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"
