3287,"2017-05-21",3.5,"On tap at Sir Ben's. Scent is grassy, hay, and some light fruitiness. Maybe pear. Taste follows the nose. Some doughy character. A decent pilsner. Somewhat surprised by the rating. Definitely wouldn't be hard to knock back 6 to 16 though.","","MavDunk"
3287,"2017-04-22",3.8,"Keg @ Summit. Invitingly pale straw-colored pour with a small head. Lightly hazy. Nose is wonderfully inviting - waxy hay, fresh cut meadow. Lightly doughy yeast. Crisp and refreshing with a delicate earthy black pepper hop kiss on the finish. Mild fruitiness. Just a small bit of stewed corn character detracts from the experience a bit. Light body, soft and chalky. Surprisingly strong carb.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","jackl"

This very smooth, cloudy amber, pils is so gentle on the palate, one cannot resist the ""want another? temptation!

3287,"2016-08-26",3.9,"Draught pint at Greenfire in Rockford, IL, August 24th. Very, very pale gold with typical small bubbling continuing in the faintly hazy body; little head, a tiny hint of lacing...nose at first grassy and a little harsh, malty-honey sweetness comes in soon; quite fresh...though there are hints of that honey-malt sugar in the body, this is predominantly a very bitter and hoppy example, probably the most bitter (though not necessarily driest) example of the style Ive had in this Summer of Zwickels...theres also a faint cidery tartness that makes itself felt about halfway through the glass...overall an excellent rendition; I personally would like just a bit more bready malt presence, and a stronger more forward nose, and this is probably why Id pick New Glarus over this one, but Ill be picking up a 6-pack of this soon for more enjoyable comparisons.","Beloit, Wisconsin, USA","muzzlehatch"
3287,"2016-08-23",3.9,"355ml can. Wait a second this is my favorite style and a fresh top 50 rendition of it? Im intrigued... It pops open very sulphury, but it dissipates. The aroma is on point, fresh cut herbs, fresh bread. Flavor is crisp and bready, herbal, like many ive had overseas, i was skeptical by the first aroma blasting out of the can but this is a delight.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","crossovert"

3287,"2016-08-10",3.8,"12 oz can shared by my brother in law. The pour is clear golden with a ½ inch white head. The aroma is hay, herbal and fresh cracker malt. The taste is great balance between the herbal grassy hay notes and the super clean and fresh cracker malt. The palate is light to bodied, great unfiltered mouth feel and a clean dry mineral herbal finish. Nicely executed beer in one of my favorite styles.","Kansas, USA","theisti"

3287,"2016-07-27",3.4,"Pour is a hazy straw with a large white head. Aroma is a nice fresh baked biscuit with a a herbal European hop. Flavor is again a nice bready and chewy malt with a touch of honey sweetness. A decent hop follows the swallow. This is a pretty malt heavy pils but it is still full of flavor and refreshing at the same time.","St.louis, Missouri, USA","thegreenrooster"
3287,"2016-07-21",4.1,"Can - Clear straw yellow pour with a foamy white head. Nose is flowery, lightly herbal hops with a doughy, crackery dry malt.

3287,"2016-07-18",4.2,"Aroma is herbal/spicy hops and German yeast/malts. The flavor is German yeast, fruit and a long and complex mix of bitter, beery and herbal/spicy hops in the finish.","Quad Cities, Iowa, USA","wlajwl"
3287,"2016-07-15",3.9,"Pours light dull yellow with a bit of haze and a large white head. The aroma has clean pale pils malt, extra yeast, fresh dough and a rounded freshness. It has a medium body with soft carbonation. The taste has malt thats doughy but dry, rich without being sweet, light spice and grassy hops and a delicate balance to everything. Very pleasant.","Florissant, Missouri, USA","vyvvy"

3287,"2016-06-21",3.8,"12 oz. can from 12 pack. Pours clear gold straw color with a white head that dissipates to a slight film and decent lacing. Aroma is grassy straw light corn and hops showing up. Taste is a little bitter hop bite with grassy corn malt. Palate thin crisp and refreshing. I dig it!","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","portableparty"
3287,"2016-06-20",3.5,"7 oz. pour, on tap at Summit Beer Hall in St. Paul, Minnesota. Consumed on 6-17-16. Clear gold. Small amount of nearly white head. Good lacing. Light effervescence. I was expecting haziness given the style. Light, dry yet floral aroma. Pleasant smell. Grassy. A touch of urine in the smell. Dry, hay flavor. Watermelon. Pleasant. Light to medium body. Soft in the palate. Refreshing and drinkable. Fresh taste. Lively and fairly crisp but could stand to be crisper. Overall, a good and likable refresher but not nearly as outstanding as my fellow raters so far have made it out to be. I definitely wish it were far yeastier.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","islay"
3287,"2016-06-13",4.0,"12oz can pours a pale clear yellow/straw with a large white head. Aroma of grassy hops, dry yeast, and honey biscuit malt. Crisp, smooth, sweet and dry, grainy malt hits yeast and dry grassy bitter hops. Simple, drinkable, and delicious. In my mind the ideal all around beer. I hope they continue brewing this past their 30 anniversary, Ill be buying it!","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Atom"
3287,"2016-06-11",4.2,"Can. Pours a near clear pale yellow with a white head that lasts throughout the beer. Aroma has lots of grain and hay with a great crisp grass note supporting.

3287,"2016-06-07",3.8,"Straw yellow colr with a medium head. Floral hop aroma. Big grainy malt flavor. Light earth hop character. Medium bitterness. Dry. Simple, but crazy drinkable.","Blaine, Minnesota, USA","badgerben"
3287,"2016-06-05",4.1,"I purchased a six pack of this. Where they went with 16 oz cans for the double IPA, they are selling this in 12 oz, and that seems backwards. In Franconia you are going to have this by the liter/half liter. I poured almost two cans into a Weihenstephaner dimpled mug. Initially a tall white head that fades quickly, but leaves thick lace on the glass and on top of the beer. Immediately recognizable as a keller bier from the first sip. There is lots of yeast, and crisp, dry malt. Some bread dough. Very dry. Aftertaste of light malt. Hops add a bitter flavor that works well with the malt flavor. They nailed the style. This is one of the best beers Summit has ever produced.","St. Louis Park, Minnesota, USA","JK"
3287,"2016-05-27",3.9,"Pale yellow-golden color, with a slight haze, 1 inch white, thick head. Lots of visible carbonation. Sweet, bready, floral aroma. Good body and mouth feel. Sweet and mild initial taste with fruits and spices. The sweet malts are nicely balanced with hops, but this is not a bitter beer, it is malt and yeast forward, with a hint of banana & cloves from the yeasts. Very enjoyable, one of the better summer beers Ive had in awhile.","Minnesota, USA","MNAle"
