*It comes from Kalamazoo, where we lived 3 years and where my son was born, so experiencing it is sort of like old trout John returning to his native stream.
*I like the 16-oz. can, which is just right for throwing into or digging out of a cooler.
*When I get philosophical, I can lament the fact Bells still hasnt figured out that two-hearted is a compound adjective, and needs a hyphen.

Taste is moderately sweet and moderately bitter, stable with long duration with some kick in the aftertaste. Medium body, oily texture. soft to average carbonation, finish is bitter, soapy and classical. Summary: IPA mainly based on grapes and oranges aroma with not really friendly malty character - slightly soapy. Beside this everything is on the right place - the bitterness, balance and timing. PODSUMOWANIE (Polish): IPA w głównej mierze bazująca na aromatach winogron, pomarańczy i grejfrutów, czyli reprezentująca trochę odmienny charakter w porównanie do tego co mamy do zaoferowanie na polskiej scenie kraftowej (głównie owoce tropikalne, aroamty kwiatowe). Na plus jest na pewno jej bardzo zbalansowany charakter z wyróżniającą się goryczką. Niestety aroamty winogorogonowo-pomarańczowe spowodowały, że nabrała trochę mdłego charakteru.

From the bottle, poured a hazy yellow-orange color, seems to be exceptionally hazy for an IPA, with lots of lacing and foam, which thins to slight white head. Aroma is a delicious variety of malty grain and floral citrus hops, the sweet malt and juicy hops combine to form notes of sweet orange. Flavor is a full-bodied malty smoothness with a solid pacific resin and citrus hoppy bitterness, quite the sensory combination. Finishes with a warm caramel malty accented bitterness, definitely memorable if not quite as stellar as its high reviews suggest. Definitely delicious overall.

3853,"2016-08-12",4.4,"Canned Dated was 6/29/16: The beer poured very clear but not crystal clear which is to be expected for a beer with as much kettle and dry hop as this beer has. Beautiful, creamy white head formed immediately and lasted. The color is straw to light copper. The aroma is more balanced than one would expect for an IPA hopped with Pacific NW Centennial. Aroma is more malty but the citrus of the Centennial does come through. The first taste is more to the malt bill but the Centennial shines on the back side. Bitterness is well balanced with the malt bill and lingers on the back and sides of the tongue. If their house yeast is the yeast its purported to be, they do a great job with it. The beer is much fruitier than other IPAs and is more malty sweet than most but it fits in well with the mid-west style IPA.

3853,"2016-05-31",4.5,"One of my favorites, though one does have to watch the bottle date -- since this beer is distributed widely, it tends to sit on shelves and one can easily pick up a bottle thats over 2 years old if you arent watching. Ive also noticed a lot of variation between batches -- one month, a fresh bottle will taste very fruity, the next, more bitter. Consistency aside, this is a reliably enjoyable beer. Fruity, grassy nose, bitters and fruity finish. Sometimes leaves an aftertaste that reminds me of Fruity Loops cereal, lovely!","Olivet, Michigan, USA","GRMule"

My initial reaction was one of slight disappointment - I mean, come on, this beer is fairly legendary! Perhaps not to the extent of, say, Heady Topper, or Pliny, but its up there. When I uncapped it, though, the initial aroma was not as penetrating as I was expecting or hoping for. However, once I started drinking it, the flavours started to build and assert themselves. Not as citrusy as a lot of current A/IPAs, the resiny pine really dominates this. Finishes strong, with just enough malt sweetness to balance the moderately high bitterness. (And, to be fair, at three months old its entirely possible that the aromas have faded significantly. Might have to try it again if I can find a newer one.) (15/20)","CANADA","UXO"

3853,"2015-10-15",3.5,"Pretty good IPA. I couldnt think of much to write about this one, but I finally had a chance to try some and wanted to get some basic thoughts down. Its usually not been available in my area and is too expensive at its regular price here, but I found some that were available and on sale. It didnt blow me away, but there were no noticeable deficiencies- good hops profile with the expected amount of hops, not watery, etc.. Definitely a good solid IPA that any IPA drinker should find a reasonable representation of the style, and a lot better than the rush of beers we see getting labeled IPAs for marketing reasons that arent true IPAs. This is a true IPA. Having said that, I dont understand what the hype is about, really- its not anything spectacular except in the way that a good IPA is always spectacular to people who like IPAs. I would give a slight edge to the Sierra Nevada Torpedo on taste, and, in my area, I can get 12 of those for $3.50 more than 6 of these cost (with no 12 packs available locally) when both are at the regular prices. On sale, it was a fine value, but I cant think of a reason to buy this over a Torpedo when its not on-sale, and it passes over the 6-pack spending limit Ive set for myself at its regular price. Now, perhaps the regular pricing listed was because its new to my area or outside their core midwestern distribution heartland (Brewery is in Michigan) or whatever, and its a bit less expensive closer to the brewery relative to its national competition- in which case I would totally understand why this is a lot of peoples go-to everyday beer.","Maryland, USA","CharmCityCrab"

3853,"2015-09-04",4.3,"Bells famous and renowned IPA hopped only with Columbus, one of the three great American C-hops and known for its Cascade-like orange aroma combined with more bittering power. Moussy, egg-white, irregularly lacing head forming islands of foam and retaining very well on the edges, draped over a sunny, warm pale orange coloured, clear beer with strains of fine bubbles here and there, turning into a warm and equal orange mist with deposit. Dank but elegantly hoppy, enticing aroma of pink grapefruit flesh, fresh orange peel, pine needles, hemp, medium grilled pork, home made caramel, red raspberry, toasted bread and hints of roasted peanuts, field flowers, green olives, minerals, sundried tomato, capers in olive oil, hint of chicken broth. Refinedly fruity, edged onset of soft tropical fruits (pineapple, mango) with already a subtle announcement of grapefruity hoppiness to come, minerally with a subtle saltiness, soft and lean, slick body built from biscuity, very lightly toasted malts, ending in a splendour of elegant yet powerful, drying, piney, grapefruity, floral hop bitterness, resiny and sec but still leaving a trace of juicy, caramelly malt sweetishness underneath, while a faint caper-like saltiness keeps lingering as well, without disturbing me. This is indeed almost as good as it gets for a regular IPA: perfectly in balance, visually attractive, quenching and extremely elegant. The bitterness goes on for a long time, but does not become abrasive or agressive anywhere. I am glad I got the chance to taste this, this is nowhere extreme, but balanced to perfection, like many of Bells beers. I fully understand now how this got its reputation, even though it is dark and rainy outside, this beer makes me dream of a brightly sunny afternoon. Would love to taste one fresh from tap, though.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Pleasant enticing aroma of resin, yeast, bread that is most pronounced when first poured but goes as the head dissipates. strong sharp hop on the front which is mellowed by malt but finishes w a bitter hop aftertaste. Palate is wrecked a bit by the hop overload. Can't taste much as a result - some pine, floral notes. First few sips were quite nice but it is getting harder to drink the more I try.

3853,"2015-07-31",3.8,"Pours a froth, beautiful bubble durchzogen white head, with a sunny amber, slighty hazy color.

Smells of grass driven orange, coated up by bitter lemon zest. Citrus peel grows stronger, as the beer warms up with unripe, sour kiwi, as well as apricot skin. Still, the maltiness is very strong on the nose, adding a note of earth and rock sugar to the hops.

Has a medium carbonation, exhibiting a refreshing, hop forward beer, with lots of exotic fruits to it, as well a prominent malt backbone.

Begins with sweeter, biscuity malts, revealing toffee infused rye bread, giving the malts a pleasant depth, balancing the well pronounced hops easily. Reveals surprisingly sweet toffee malts, which get joined by far reaching lime juice, which lends the beer a profound, bitter refreshment. The hops get enhanced by dried tangerine peel and apple stones, providing an aggressive dryness, which features a worthy counterpart to the well developed malt backbone, staying on the tongue for a longer while.

Well balanced, easy drinking ipa which isnt convincing only for its hoppy part, but also for its eigenständig malty part, adding to the hops, while balancing them, without cutting them short in any way. Old school ipa, with a straight forward, long lasting hoppiness, providing a great fruiti- and dryness, successfully coated up by the malts.","GERMANY","aleigator"

Aroma: Immediate pine, only subtle resin; sweet, only mildly acidic citrus (tangerine?)
Appearance: hazy, wonderfully unfiltered, great lacing up the glass.
Taste: Pine-y bitterness rests upon a large helping of biscuity malt. Could have more complexity in the hops--but the malt backbone lends *light beer commercial misogyny voice* drinkability.
Palate: even and unremarkable due, again, to the balance.

Overall: when youre a Kalamazooer, youve had enough of these (and enough of those fresh) that, even if you prefer more massive hop flavors, you can come to this for its balance and drinkability as a standby. Im probably prejudiced in favor of this guy--you can cough it or savor it.

I dropped my usual basket of local made beers and picked up the Bells that were available for sale at the corner market - a fine place for beers, but still a little surprising to see something so new and exotic at. As for the Two-Hearted Ale itself, it practically bushes with an orange and brown russet color, with a thin white head.

3853,"2014-11-26",4.8,"Purchased from Keg Liquors in Clarksville, IN. Poured from a very fresh 16oz can. The nose is bright, resinous, and citrusy - very hop-forward with a supportive sweet malt backing. The appearance is appropriate for an unfiltered IPA, with one finger of a lasting white head. The flavor matches the nose with an initial influx of piney, citrusy hops that fades into a mild, slightly bitter, sweet malt finish. I detect little to no alcohol in the flavor. Smooth and medium-light on the palate with an average to lively carbonation that held up throughout the 20 minutes that I was sipping on it. The only possible detracting characteristic that I can detect is slightly below medium bitterness which is a maybe a little low for the style according to the BJCP guidelines, but this may just be my palate. It doesnt detract from the beer itself at all. I think this is an incredibly well-balanced beer. Id heard good things, and I certainly wasnt disappointed.

Very mild effervescence and hoppy bitterness are well in tune with the malted sweetness evident here. This is a brew ahead of the hop craze, with plenty of true hop strength but still very drinkable and well in balance.

Finishes rich on the tongue and lingers. A great brew without the excess of some other IPAs (although there is certainly room in the world for them too :)

A healthy head (about two fingers) gives way to a floral hop aroma with traces of tropical fruit. While the hops are the real star in this beer, it has enough malt backbone to keep it from being hop juice.

OCCASION: Happy 38th birthday, myself--with the fam, Jer and Matt...APPEARANCE: orange amber body; filmy and hazy; thick, white three-finger head; lacing extends upward and thickly spreads across the glass--a great start... AROMA: fruity and hoppy; apple and citrus first; some bubblegum yeasts too; lastly, some metallic suggestions... PALATE: fantastic, medium-bodied and arresting--effervescent and alive; an IPA to sip and simmer with--little suggestion of alcohol, but definitely weightier than a pint glass... TASTE: balanced caramel malts underpin a hop festival of Noble and citrus--tangy tangerine and teeth-rattling pine resin, a combo that shakes and soothes in unison--this is the IPA the beer folk warn us about...OVERALL: as IPAs go, a mecca of sorts--the hype is to be believed--and although there are many that rival Two Hearted, it is a beer I will seek out again, even if its only found in a case at a PSU distributor, as this was; the name itself evokes that ""slow"" short story that nonetheless reveals so much of mans plight and hope, and this is a worthwhile stab at perfection....","Great Meadows, New Jersey, USA","Dacrza"

 Served on tap in a pint glass

 Appearance  Served a light amber color with a tiny white head. The head faded quite fast to leave only a very small amount of lacing.

 Smell  The smell is very light and consists of some sweet caramel, bread, lighter fruit smells and a citrus hop smell.

 Taste  The taste begins on the drier side and is of a light roasted malt with a decent presence of a an citrus hop bitterness. In the middle it sweetness slightly with some flavors of caramel and light fruit coming to the tongue. These flavors are rather short lived however and fade toward the end, where a more sharp bitter earthy and citrus nature come to the tongue. 

 Mouthfeel  The body of the beer is on the slightly above higher than average side in terms of creaminess with a medium level of carbonation. Good for the hop flavors as well as for the more bitter and sharp hop flavors.

 Overall  Not much sweetness here but very nice and dry. A flavorful and tasty drier IPA with a nice sharp hop and malty base.","","Darkmagus82"

Its near glowing blurry honey orange in color and it has a nice medium sized really cloudy off-white head with extremely good retention and lacing capabilities.

Its it punching you in the nose, thats for sure but its so round and elegant. Its exactly the same in the taste. This is not a super hoppy raw American hop bomb, but its extremely balanced with round edges. It has a nice near cloudy mouthfeel and a really conformable average carbonation level. Soft peaches, a little piney bitterness on the top of the palate, I get soft branches and a little bit of whipped cream. Did I mention that this is balanced? Cause it is.

APPEARANCE: Pours a hazy slightly cloudy golden straw color. Big huge billowy head that dissipated rather quickly leaving some great lacing patterns. 

AROMA: The nose was a bit subdued. Floral notes, summertime dandelions and soft grass. Nice & mellow citrus and pine hops. 

TASTE: I get grain and sweet malts up front. Nice citrus wave crashes and releases some grapefruit and tropical fruits. Slight bitterness on the end. 

MOUTHFEEL: Light and crisp with medium body and medium prickly carbonation. Dry snappy finish. 

OVERALL: Very solid brew. I think of it as a gateway into IPA's. Not a lot of that bitterness that I'm used to but still really enjoyable.

A: Hazy golden ale. Nice, fine creamy head dissipates quickly leaving a quilt of bubbles which are patiently assisted with a low carbonation visibly rising to the surface. 

S: cotton candy, sweet peach, pine and hemp are the highlights. Not a citrus bomb like many IPAs these days. Smells fresh, nice and unique among the genre. Quite enjoyable.

T: Again, cotton candy, bubble gum. Not particularly bitter. Im a bit baffled, and intrigued by this beer. Bells seems to have a different take on IPAs than Im used to. Not bad, but different. I am obliged to say I like this.

M: Medium body with higher carbonation that spices the tongue. Leave mouth well moisturized and compels me to take another sip. Fun.

D: This beer is for the faint of heart. If I were having a tasting with a bunch of hopheads that just wanted a slam of hops to the face, I would not bring this. If I were to serve an IPA to oenophile, I would serve this. They have done a great job finding a beautiful combo. And lucky for them, it is a flagship!

Off the nose

Moderate hopps
Biscuit, malt and bread
Perfect carbonation

on the backend:

Sweet, but well balanced
No shitty aftertaste

Good going down

The 7%abv is well masked

I had 4 beers and ""feelin' it""

I definitely recommend this beer. This beer is the definition of a well balanced ipa.

A- Golden to orange color with brilliant clarity, pours with a two finger white head. Good retention and lacing, which lasts throughout the glass.

S- Smells of grapefruit and pineapple with a slight yeast character also present. A slight caramel sweetness possibly from the malt in the background. 

T- Floral and grassy hop flavors along with some citrus fruit, once again the pineapple and grapefruit from the nose is apparent. A sweet note (possibly caramel malt?) is present on the back end of the sip. Moderate bitterness, but it doesnt overpower or peel your enamel like some in the style. No alcohol taste is present.

M- Medium/high carbonation, low/medium mouthfeel, and a great drying note on the end from the low finishing gravity of this beer really dries things out and makes for a refreshing beer that you want to take another sip of almost immediately.

O- Trying to be as objective as possible with this one, but in all honesty, I just love this beer! It is incredibly drinkable; I could easily drink 3-4 of these in the time it takes me to drink some other IPAs. The flavors of the centennial hops dominate, but there is enough malt to back it up.

Taste is just as impressive, sweet earthy malt balanced by a perfect hop profile with just the right bitterness, and a nice citrusy spice. A bit of an alcohol presence that fades into the hops. Very smooth mouth feel. One the best single IPAs I've had, if not the very best. I was lucky enough to get a case of this through a friend in Pennsylvania, as they do not distribute anywhere in New England or New York.

Cest ma première bière en fût bue sur cette île certainement quétaine.  La fameuse Two Hearted arrive devant moi comme une oasis après 8 jours de marche dans le désert El Azizia.  Le nez est explosif et cest peu dire.  Mes narines sont complètement assaillies par une horde de fruits aux dents bien acérées : des pêches et des agrumes de toute sorte montrent une sublime puissance.  Impressionnant.  Une fois le choc passé, je trouve, derrière cette expertise fruitée, autre chose de très vert comme la rencontre entre une forêt boréale et une forêt de la côte ouest : jai des conifères et des fleurs qui poussent dans les orifices de mes fosses nasales.  Je suis ravi.  La première gorgée est fantastique.  La seconde et les suivantes sont merveilleuses.  Jai sur les papilles des saveurs maltées mielleuses et des saveurs houblonnées à me faire croire que dieu peut exister linstant de quelques lampées: je me prosterne quelques secondes face à Kalamazoo en louangeant les fleurs, le cèdre et les fruits tropicaux et du verger qui arrivent comme une volonté divine.  En bouche, tout est fait pour me plaire.  Le corps presque huileux et le pétillement calibré de cette bière sont des facteurs qui facilitent grandement sa buvabilité.  Cette bière est tellement facile à boire que je dois me retenir entre chaque gorgée pour faire durer le plaisir.  La finale, comme une ode aromatique, est plutôt sèche et moyennement intense.  Nul doute que cette proposition est extraordinaire.  Extraordinaire car elle est excessivement fraîche et extraordinaire car, pour un moment, je suis Ernest Hemingway et je pars à linstant boire un coup au Sloppy Joes.","Candiac, Quebec, CANADA","SlovakSniper"

Appearance: It has to be the best beer Ive seen ... behind MAYBE the legendary Guinness. I got it and it had a nice, dark color to it with a beautiful three finger head on it. A thing of beauty. Better yet was the super sticky lacing -- with every sip, you could see the line of how much I drank. Fantastic.

Smell: The smell and taste and a lot of what I got from this was a very deep, pleasant earthy and spicy hoppiness. The smell is much like the taste.

Taste: But the taste is just a BIT better. As nice as it smells, it comes out in every sip. Wonderful balance with the hops... great flavor, with a perfect light bitterness on the finish. I love that I get a taste of Fruit Loops in there, as well as an earthy grit. Delicious.

Mouthfeel: Nice and smooth ... goes down dangerously easy for a 7% ABV.

3853,"2013-03-15",3.3,"Bottle from New Orleans restaurant in Greensboro.  Dry, lightly bitter and hopped, with a bit of citrus.  Citrus in the aroma, but a bit plain.  Fair but short lived head over a slightly opaque orange beer.  Tastes fairly good.","Berkshire, ENGLAND","prawlie"
3853,"2013-03-15",4.2,"Appearance: hazy, near marmalade-colored pour with one finger of creamy white head fading to a thick collar; tons of soapy lace curtains sliding down the sides.   Aroma: 	fresh-smelling aromatic hops waft boldly from the head, carrying scents of grapefruit, orange rind, apricots and even strawberries; under all the hops is an aroma of freshly-baked fruitcake.   Taste: bitter hops dominate up front, giving flavors of orange, lemon juice, and resinous pine; a sweet, bready, graham cracker-ish malt tries and largely succeeds to balance.  Finish: the bitterness fades reasonably quickly, but the character of the hop notes actually last  longer, and in the finish they are more flowery than citrusy; as the bitterness fades, the sweet malt, with a hint of molasses, sidles up to round out the end.   Notes: I am an admitted IPA hater, or have been traditionally.  Nevertheless, the style is growing on me like crazy, mainly because of IPAs like this.  Its not bitter for the sake of being bitter; the hops are there to provide a wonderful, aromatic and delicious experience.  The malt bill is not an afterthought, but serves as a perfect foil to what bitterness is there.  I may be an IPA hater, but I love this beer.","Maryland, USA","JDBaker11058"

Appearance: What a great looking IPA. The body is a clear amber with some carbonation showing in the body, the head is a thick white mess with great retention.
Aroma: The aroma is light, pine comes to mind first with slight spice and some citrus. I wish it were stronger.
Taste: The flavor is balanced, toasted malts with floral hops that dry out on the finish, hints of pine and citrus, but overall a bit bland. This is balanced nicely, but it needs some character.
Palate: Light to medium bodied, very light carbonation.
Overall: I dont get the huge love for this beer, I guess I simply like my beers a bit bolder. This is balanced well, but the hops and malts are too faint, I prefer something a bit bolder.","Atco, New Jersey, USA","keanex"

Taste starts with an abrasive bitterness along with some grapefruit, tangerine, and floral. Then get a little more malt than the smell suggests. Slight sweetness as well as some bready qualities to somewhat balance the hops. Then the finish returns the abrasive bitterness along with spicy pine, grapefruit, a little orange, floral. Get almost a bubblegum finish when it warms due to the malts starting to show though.

Lots of pine and earth upon tasting with hardly a hint of fruit. Quite assertive maltyness too lending an really nice balance. Strong bitterness throughout but very appropriate for the style. For not being strong on fruity hops, the beer has a real ""juicy"" character that is refreshing. Mouthfeel is full but a little too sticky for my liking.

The hops really jump out much more on tap as I tried a bottle just yesterday. Hops are super fresh: citrusy, floral, and earthy. Malts are smart enough to stay out of the way and let the hops shine here. Exactly what an IPA should be.","Seattle, Washington, USA","ACHops"

3853,"2012-12-12",5.0,"22 is my lucky number and this is my lucky 22nd rating! I saved this beer for it because it is my favorite beer of all time and the beer that broke me into craft beer. I remember the first time I had a lady, the first time I met Mary Jane, and the first time I had a Two Hearted. I was headed on a trip to the west side of the mitten with a lady to do some camping many years ago and on a whim (maybe it was the hemingway-esque line) I picked up a sixer of this brew. I stuffed it into the cooler and proceeded to our camp spot, it was of course raining cats + dogs and nearly impossible to make camp. I reached into the cooler and pulled out an icy cold bottle in the hot humid car and took a sip. My life was changed forever, seriously. I cant lie though a couple of summers ago I cheated on Two Hearted with Founders Centennial and I thought it might best it, but absence made the heart grow fonder and I found my way back home to My beloved 2<3ed. I feel blessed to be a Michigander and claim this as my everyday IPA, doubt Ill ever put out another 5 ever but I had to for this one. Tonight I had it on tap @ the Union Woodshop into  a mason jar, beautiful orange glow and thumbs worth of off-white head. Smells of flowers in spring and crisp fresh lake air. Taste is impeccable for a single hop (centennial) IPA, balanced, crisp without biting, citrusy, very light pine. Simply tremendous mouthfeel and finish. Also the phenomena of Two Hearted burps is unlike any other IPA I have ever drank. Seek this beer out if you have not had it and enjoy.","Michigan, USA","UnionBeerCzar"

3853,"2012-10-30",3.8,"UPDATED: JAN 5, 2015 Update:  From a can, just under 4 months old.  Not sure why this beer is so variable for me, but this can was certainly better than my last experience.  Its been a rocky road, but I think I am starting to understand this beer.  Its a solid example of its corner of the IPA world.  
Im about to give up on this beer.  I intentionally bought a relatively fresh bottle just to make sure Im not crazy.  Pours a pale gold with head fading to a film leaving decent lacing.  Aroma is slight floral and citrus, but mainly dominated by grain and wheat.  More tart when swirled, but there are no hops at all here.  This bottle was less than two months old.  Not as fresh as can be, but Bells themselves say the shelf life for Two Hearted is 6 months(!).  I hate to rate lower for something I know isnt a good representation...but then again Ive had Surly Furious thats 6 months old and still retains 90% of the hop feel.  This must be a delicate beer.  Taste is sweet and grainy up front, then finally some hop bitterness in the middle, ending decently, but still holding on to some of the sweet grains.  Almost, dare I say, an adjunct feel to this one.   I want to like this one, but Im having a hard time.  
This beer is different every time.  This bottle was 2.5 months old, so not sure how that affects it.  Pours a pale gold with pillowy white head and lots of bubbles.  This bottles aroma was balanced between fruity hops and sweet malts.  Subdued but good.   Taste is very balanced, restrained, almost mild.  Very good balance of hops and malts.  This is a subtle IPA with no evidence of alcohol.  Palate is creamy and smooth.  This is an IPA that wont offend anyone.  Still, why does it taste different every time I review it.  This ones bitterness was nowhere near ""strong"" like last time.  8+5+8+5+14=4.0

Pours a golden orange with small white lasting head.  Aroma is sweet, full, and balanced - really good.  Taste is similar, but the resiny bitterness is just slightly too strong at the end.  Smooth, crisp, and unique.  Moderately bitter at the end - maybe a little too much? 9+4+8+4+14 = 3.9

Pours a cloudy golden orange with head dissipating into a ring around the edge.  Aroma is citrus - grapefruit.  Lively carbonation, a bitter shot of hops, followed by a slight bready malt balance, then right back to a bitter aftertaste on the sides of your tongue.  Slightly metallic aftertaste.  This is not a bad beer, but for me it was more of an ""OK"" IPA rather than ""top-notch"".  7+4+7+4+10=3.2","Minnesota, USA","Ericular"

3853,"2012-09-04",3.2,"A: A bright golden color. See through, rich amber. The head was surprisingly thick and solid. Biteable even. Leaves a very nice lacing. 

S: Slightly fruity smell, but just slightly. Nice. 

T: When cold, it has that crisp bitterness that masks any subtlety. 
It has an odd, fishy aftertaste that reminds me of lake water... but thats probably because of the bottle label. Unfortunately as it warms up it gets noticeably sour. Like warm, old orange juice. (personal experience. Dont ask.) 

M: Crisp, significant carbonation. A slight greasy feel that goes away quickly. 

Not bad. No danger of it becoming my favorite beer, but certainly wouldnt turn one down if offered. I like it better cold, unlike most darker beers, and ales in general for that matter. Cold and out of the bottle instead of in a glass, its actually very good.

3853,"2012-08-16",3.7,"I have had this beer many times over the years, and am quite overdue to write a review.

The appearance is clear and light orange hued. The head stands in at around an inch thick, displays lasting retention and leaving ample lacing on the pint glass. The aroma is not particularly grand, but is pleasant nonetheless. Scents include malt, floral notes, light pine. The flavor is tasty, and though the beer is primarily hop forward, it definitely has a strong malt backbone. This is a good example of what I would consider a ""balanced"" IPA. Though I prefer beers of this ilk to be lighter on the palate and more hop forward with a pronounced citrus component, there is no denying that Bells Two Hearted Ale is a tasty brew. Additionally, I think this beer, like many IPAs, is a notch better on draft versus the bottle.

Having first tried it a few years back, I was convinced that I had encountered a several tainted batch, and many who had lamented this beer had came to the same conclusion because a beer so lauded shouldnt taste so poor.

In the simplest description, this beer tastes like pond water to me, although it does not smell that way. I do believe theres a small group of people out there who have a distribution of taste buds that pull out this ""pond water"" flavor over all the hops and alcohol. 

Im writing this review less to remonstrate this beer and more to make other reviewers aware that if you taste ""pond water,"" then you best move on, and sort this beer as a strange anomaly of an IPA. Its not a bad batch, its just a bad match, one I do not hold against Bells in the slightest.

3853,"2012-07-02",4.9,"UPDATED: FEB 16, 2013 Bottle pour. One of the smoothest IPAs I have ever had. Glorious hop notes, with a fresh finish. I have had a lot of IPAs and this one is not the hoppiest, nor the maltiest. It doesnt have the highest ABV I have ever had or anything like that. But I give it a 4.9 because there is absolutely nothing I would change about this beer. As an experienced homebrewer I often find myself thinking, oh I would add this hop to a beer, oh I would modify this or that. I cannot find anything at all that I would change about two hearted ale. It is far and away the most balanced, best all around beer I may have ever had. Cheers Bells Brewery, thanks for perfecting the American IPA.

Update vs Stone IPA:
Oh man. Here we go. Its rumble time. Im pouring six IPAs tonight, into two identical tulip glasses so I can compare, with this one going head to head with Stone IPA. The two american IPAs, both with 100/100 on ratebeer. Damn, this ought to be fun. Aroma of stone is nice and floral, but Two hearted wins the category. Dont get me wrong, the citrus and glorious honey and hop aroma of stone is great but it has to go up against the two hearted, and two hearteds balanced hop aroma wins. In taste Stone IPA is more hoppy, citrus and floral, but Two hearted is more balanced. Two hearted though just is so unbelievably smooth with all the citrus hops coming through still that I have to give it the category. Two hearteds finish is better as well. Im calling it for Two hearted here. Both are epic, but in a battle of heavyweights the two hearted wins. On to the next!

Into the finished stone glass I poured Bear Republic Racer 5. They look incredibly similar in identical glasses. Two hearted won against stone IPA, can it take down a equally matched racer 5? I think racer 5 wins the aroma category. Both are gloriously hoppy, but the racer has a more hop forward aroma with the obviously floral hops coming out nicely. It smells like the lineup of glorious american hops it has in it, chinooks, cascades, columbus and centennials. Two hearted, hands down wins the taste category though. if only barely. Two hearted is balanced where racer 5 is bold. Both are citrusy with racer 5 bringing out more citrus where two hearted is more floral. Finish though, two hearted wins every time. I honestly dont think it can be beaten as an American IPA. The other beers Im having tonight come close, but not close enough.","","neontb"

Fresh and alive, does not have roasted tastes or much malty sweetness. Good for a hot day.

3853,"2012-04-05",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 7, 2013 Citrusy and sweet and floral in the scent, but not very strong (I tested this vs. Founders, and everyone preferred Founders). Head and lacing retain wonderfully. Somewhat lighter golden color. Not as sweet as I was expecting from the smell - somewhat at first, then the hops invite themselves. Very smooth despite the VERY notable hop kick at the end. Mouthfeel is less oily and heavy than many IPAs.  Wow the Bells is smooth, especially prior to the hopbomb.  I am noticing the Fruity Pebbles aftertaste more this time around (July 2012) compared to my first rating (Spring 2012), so I will also give it extra points there.  Still, everyone agreed Founders has more of a hop/malt presence and long-lasting aftertaste relative to Bells, and more of a body.  So, good as this beer may be, and much as I am uprating this while downrating my view of Founders slightly, I still personally prefer Founders Centennial.  MAY 2013 RERATE: Downrating slightly.  Fruity Pebbles citrus again, as it usually is.  But I had a Stone Pale Ale prior to this, which was as good as it usually is (malt backbone and all), and I find myself preferring the Stone.

Appearance: The color is a golden cloud of with moderate head and lacing. Carbonation is moderate.

Aroma: Predominant spicy notes presenting resonate herbs with faint elements of pine and citrus.

Taste: The hops are prevalent with a fruity element that sits on the palate long after each sip similar to a grapefruit without its excessive tartness.

Palate: A smooth medium-heavy body encompasses the palate.

Overall: This beer is a very unique interpretation of an American IPA but very positively so. For anybody who loves a good solid IPA... Give this one a try! Prosit!!!

	Medium in the mouth with a heavy strange floral hop, unique kind of IPA approach.  Atypical in the fact that its hitting you with some hop that is not common, and reminds me of tangy fruit like grapefruit but not, a flowery feel like the tang of a dandelion stem, but not.  Hard to peg.  Flowers and fruit.  Little oily in the finish, resolving to hops on the tip and alcohol in the back.  I like it.  I like Bells.  Bravo, good sirs.","","Tak_en_Lou"

3853,"2012-02-21",4.3,"UPDATED: MAR 12, 2012 From notes.  Originally reviewed 4/6/2009.  On tap in a pint glass.

The beer is a bit lighter than an amber, the two hearted ale pours a full orange color with a rich, creamy head. Leaves slight, but noticeable lacing down the side of the glass in rings at the level of rest. 

The nose has a strong caramel malt aroma with citrus hints, along with a strong hop character.

A strong malt flavor greets the palette, with the orange and apricot citrus flavors creeping in. The hops bring in the more detailed grapefruit and peach flavors. A nice bitter pinch at the end of the sip is nicely offset by a caramelized sweetness, leaving my mouth with a wonderful taste.

The body is medium to full, somewhat grainy feel. More creamy than carbonated.

Two hearted is a pretty incredible beer with a strong, balanced flavor. Definitely a nice beer to enjoy with a flavorful sandwich. This beer has enough flavor to keep me interested and is balanced enough for me to really savor it.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","KickInChalice"

3853,"2011-10-27",4.0,"UPDATED: MAR 9, 2015 Okay, I apologize for this rating since Im fairly certain I got a bad bottle here since the rating for this are stellar and this was not very good when I tried it.  There was a strange mucus-looking spiral of what I thought was yeast when I poured this which I dont think Ive ever seen in a beer before.   There was also a strange cotton candy/bubblegum aroma that I dont think fits with this beer style.  Overall, it didnt taste horrible, but it just wasnt that great, so I will endeavor to get another bottle (unfortunately this was from AZ when I traveled there so Ill have to wait to get another one since we dont get this in CA) and then re-rate this then.                                                               

*3/8/2015 - New rating*   Finally found this on tap at Tustin Brewing!   Okay, *now* I see why this is a highly rated beer!

Small bubbles cackle over the honey tea body. Smell is Hoppy, but its definitely put in a sweet background context. Taste is a hop flavor seasoning more than bitterness with a big sweet tea bread malt character. Light brioche, some sugary bread off set by a hard candy/gummy hop flavor. Really nice balance, and definitely consistent with that malty forward IPA I associate with the midwest.","Palm Desert, California, USA","cavery"
3853,"2011-10-11",4.2,"UPDATED: OCT 15, 2015 Tasted bottle from Trader Joes into nucleated pint glass. Poured a nice, clear deep amber color with creamy off-white head. Powerful hops aroma, some sweet, bready notes in the background. Powerful flavors as well: complex blend of malts, I can definitely taste bread, caramel, toast, hints of biscuit, maybe even flaked and roasted barley. India Pale Ale is, by definition, aggressively hopped. So is Two Hearted Ale, of course, but its rich malty-sweetness stands right up to the hops bitterness, a rare balancing feat for IPAs. Very refreshing light-medium body, rounded mouthfeel, and fruity yeast finish. Highly recommended.","Maplewood, Missouri, USA","seymour"
3853,"2011-10-10",4.3,"UPDATED: DEC 17, 2011 Bottle, courtesy of Ryan, thanks!. A clear pale amber beer, with an average sized, frothy, mostly lasting white head. The aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain, cookie), moderately hoppy (grapefruit, flowers, apricot, hint of pine), with notes of lychee, poppies and tropical fruits. The flavor is moderately sweet, moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter. Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation, dry and very long finish, with moderate to heavy bitterness. Quite well balanced, clearly on the hoppy side, but with a clean, firm, not abrasive bitterness. Lots of fruity and flowery notes (I pick up even some poppy hints). One of the best IPAs out there. Also complex, not a feature many IPAs can claim. Consumed very fresh, with less than one month of age.","Firenze, ITALY","Slayer85"

Smelled of citrus and floral hops. Good balance.

Similar to the nose, a citrus and sweet, floral taste led the way. It wasnt as hoppy as I thought, but did end in a lingering bitter finish.

3853,"2011-05-31",2.8,"Nice golden straw color, but just a shade or two darker. Initial pour produced a huge white head. After it died down and I poured the rest I got a nice two finger head that lingers for quite awhile. Beautiful lacing left on the glass that stays just as foamy as the head was. Giant hop aroma seems to overpower anything else that may be trying to get out. There is a slight alcohol and sweet, sugary, malt aroma hidden in there. Other than the hops, thats about it.

The taste is something altogether different. There is a hop presence, but it is more on the back end. A bit of a flowery taste comes in up front. But it is mostly watered down malty tannins that are present. There is little body to this one. There is also an alcohol showing up in the taste as well. Along with all of that it leaves a dry feeling after each swallow. And a reminder that there is alcohol in this. I guess it borders on the low end of high ABV for the style, but it seems much higher than it is. Overall, it could be better.","Crestview, Florida, USA","suprchunk"

3853,"2011-05-24",3.6,"UPDATED: JAN 13, 2015 The aroma is full of all-American hops of a very citrusy character--very nice. Its not chewy, but its creamy enough to sustain that taste and leave a lingering bitterness, with a touch of grapefruit, on the tongue. The first two out of the entire six pack also left an ever-so-slightly skunky feel on my tongue, but the other two I drank were crisp, delicious, and skunk-free. Also, for a 7%-ABV beer, you really dont feel the alcohol in your mouth, but youll feel it in your system after you down one bottle. And, brother, do they go down quickly.

Nose has some hoppiness, but otherwise unremarkable (sitting outside, so nose is compromised). Solid, medium body with a smooth, chewy and almost creamy mouth feel: this IPA invites you to swallow it down in one go. Carbonation is moderate and very fine, which likely contributes to the superb palate. Malts are toasty with some almonds, hops are pine and grapefruit. This is a very cogent IPA which deserves more time and pints than I can give it just now. I did note that it doesnt seem to progress well as it warms.","Lakewood, Washington, USA","TheRealMGD"

Lacing was nothing special, but the golden color and carbonation was intriguing. Aroma was instant citrus, very bitter - obviously because of the hops, but it smelled rather fresh. First taste was a litter bitter, but then exploded into a mix of ripe dry citrus fruits and hops. The balance of this IPA was perfect - Bells does it again!

Ok, Im finally going to give this beer another shot. Ive shit on it twice now, but Im going to give it the benefit of the doubt due to perhaps old bottles. Bells just started distributing in NY this week, this beer was bottled less than 2 weeks ago. If its not good this time around then its never going to be good. 
Pours a clear gold with a white head. Aromas of bitter pine. Taste is like crushed Tylenol sprinkled with some citrus juice. A little too sweet. A little too thin. A little too boring. Finsihes pretty quickly with a small bit of bitterness and very low hop presence. No real juicy hop expression at all. No tropical fruit.  No new ground being covered here. THIS IS AN INTRODUCTORY IPA. People who are easily impressed score this beer highly. This is a beer for novices. Upgrading my score from 2.0 to 2.9. Never again will I waste my money on this tripe. 



this may be one of the most overrated beers on the planet. I found nothing special about this ipa.  Not nearly as good as hop stoopid or even southern tier ipa. Dissapointing hop profile, this beer is just not very good.  Not a fan at all.  Would not buy again. RERATE:  what a pile of shit this beer is. Am I just getting old bottles or something?

My pint had a nice orangy amber brew with an good sized off white fluffy head sitting in it for me to slam back... but early pacing made me look like a pussy as Kyle dropped back 2 and could have drank a third in the time I put back one. Great flavour in this thing - no let down for the hype. Soft and very creamy on the way down. Some light spice... man! is this a unique taste! Spearmint, caramel, cookies, apricot, grapefruit and thick herbal qualities. Soft orange aroma with candy, more fruits... tropicalish, resiny hops, caramel... all goodness. On the gassy side. A great beer to sit back with my new drinking partner for the week.","Blerkablerka, VENEZUELA","VertBaconStrips"

Update:  I bought a six pack because I hadnt had a tha in a while, so it was a no brainer to buy some.

There was little lacing and the flavor was lacking the important components.  I wasted 12 dollars on bad brew.  You cant win them all.

A new six pack was purchased and the same great ipa flavors with decent lacing.  Two Hearted has good days and bad days, I spose.

Had to lower the rating due to inconsistent quality.  I will give them a break and the benefit of the doubt.

Citrus-like hops with a piny finish in the aroma, completely devoid of sweetness, which is awesome.  Not astringent or overkill in any respect, and this continues to the taste as well. Very light grapefruit, but a nice hop burn, and moves on to a sherbert-like finish thats dry and soft at the same time.  The balance thats struck Dry, but not overly so, and soft body comes to mind. Between the aggressive hops, and the delicate finish is really astonishing.  The only other brewer that does this is Shaun Hill.  Squeezing in the hop greatness, but making a wonderfully drinkable and nuanced brew is actually kind of rare in my tasting experience.

A - Hazy, light golden tangelo color. Fairly full, fluffy, creamy, cloud-like head. Great retention that leaves a full and creamy lace.

S - Great, juicy, strong hop flavor with plenty of grapefruit, orange, apricot and tropical fruits along with a nice touch of floral hops. Somewhat sweet and a great balance of bitterness too. Wonderful smelling beer.

T - Nice balance between the malt and hops. A good backbone of pale malt with a slight caramel, sweetness. On top of that is a good mix of citrus and some tropical fruit hops along with floral and slightly herbal hops. The fruitiness (in particular the tropical fruit) arent quite as strong as the aroma, but are definitely present.

Lacing is thin but lasting.  A whiff of this beer is a pretty perfect IPA-lovers dream - citrus (esp. grapefruit orange), pine and flowery.  Not the strongest nose but pleasant.  Taste is grapefruit, lemon, pine resin but pretty nicely balanced with tastes of orange and sweet malts. The finish moves toward bitter but without assault - just notes that put a nice end on a good performance.  Bravo.  Mouthfeel is creamy, a little slick and medium-bodied.

3853,"2010-07-11",4.2,"Poured into Sam Adams Sensory Glass.

As I started to open the bottle I could already smell a big amount of hops that this beer had to offer! I was so excited to get that first taste! It poured a nice layer of head that was a little off white and as I drank it, it laced a little bit. The color was a orange bronze.

The aroma was of floral earthy hops. Taste was a massive amount of hops, just like the smell.

Mouth feel was bitter but left a crisp taste in the mouth. Very dry aftertaste as well.

Overall, this is one staple of an IPA. I really enjoy the style and Bells has a very nice version of it. I highly recommend!

S: The aroma is sufficiently complex for my liking... floral and citrus hops are the hallmark and a touch of yeast and malts come through

3853,"2010-05-23",3.9,"Appearance: A touch on the yellow side for an IPA but nice oily foam head that retains well and exhibits nice lacing.

Smell: Some centennial hops but a touch faded. Im starting to think that this bottle is a bit dated.

Taste: A bit bitter which is what holds me back from giving it a 4.5 in the taste category. Sweet pale malt works with the carbonation to create a buttery element.

Mouthfeel: Lots of carbonation makes this one nice and creamy. Medium body.

Drinkability: Carbonation and a medium body make this fairly easy to drink for an IPA. The hops being a touch bitter works against the drinkability.

Again I dont think I got the freshest bottle so I will sample another bottle in the future and review it again. I know that JohnTravolta21 sent me the bottle straight off of the shelf but perhaps the retail store had it sitting around for a while or perhaps Bells skimped a bit on this batch due to a hop shortage....

Flav.:  More malt-forward than the nose with some slightly darker-roasted notes to round out the biscuit and toast flavours, still a good deal of the same hop notes as the nose, with slightly more orange peel/citrus; dry with nice bitterness and a slightly alcoholic finish that is split between hops and malt...nice balance.

S- Quite promising. A beautiful bouquet of hops with a citrus aroma upfront and pine, floral, and grassy mixing well in the background.

T- Initial flavor is mild and highlights a balance of citrus and grassy hop flavor. Floral and pine hop flavor seem to mix well for the finish-with the floral hop flavor being semi-dominant. A blast of hop bitterness also enters for the finish. All that lingers is a medium strength resonance of hop bitterness. All the beautiful hop flavors are gone.

P- Medium to high carbonation and mildly oily body.

O- After having great IPAs like Alesmith, Racer 5, Centennial, and SN Anniversary this one doesnt even compare to me. Its not bad-and I can certainly drink it but is only an average IPA to me. I was somewhat disappointed because it could not compare.

3853,"2010-04-03",4.4,"UPDATED: JUN 19, 2010 Just the right amount of bitterness and malt. Both (as with the abv) are on the high side for an IPA, but neither is overwhelming.

3853,"2010-03-19",5.0,"UPDATED: JAN 13, 2011 Re-rated 1/13/11.  I always said I wouldnt give any beer a 5.0 until Id had a chance to try a Westy 12 or some of the other rare Belgians that always make the ""best of"" list.  Id had Two Hearted on several occasions, but never really fresh (I dont live in a Bells distribution state).  But, after being able to try some really fresh Two Hearted on a recent business trip, I finally decided that I simply cannot think of a way to improve this beer and it is truly worthy of my first (and, to date, only) 5.0 rating.

Pours a slightly hazy golden color.  Thick pillowy white head with great retention and lacing.  Gorgeous beer.  Aroma is lots of floral and grapefruit hops.  Flavor is huge amounts of of piney, grassy and citrus hops and a hint of caramel malt.

3853,"2010-03-11",4.4,"People always ask me why I love the India Pale Ale style of beer as much as I do. To truly answer that question Id simply give them a beer like Bells Two Hearted Ale to try for themselves. How can you not like a beer thats this tasty and highly drinkable? Sure, some beers are for acquired tastes, but this is the kind of beer anyone could enjoy.APPEARANCE AND AROMAI poured a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Upon my initial pour I found the color of bright orange to be really attractive. It formed a generous, thick, frothy head and the lacing was equally impressive. The aroma was quite strong with a clean citrusy scent with subtle floral notes as well. This is exactly the kind of IPA I can ""drink with my eyes.""TASTEThis is the tale of two beers in one (well, sorta). Since my 10oz tulip glass doesnt hold the entire bottles contents I experienced two slightly different flavors from Bells Two Hearted Ale. The initial pour was clear, crisp, clean-smelling and quite tropical. The flavor was refreshing with a strong, tart palette of grapefruit . The finish seemed a bit richer, stickier and piney. The aftertaste, interestingly enough, reverted back to the crisp citrus notes. In fact, it was rather sweet like candy.After I poured the remaining contents into the glass I noticed the body suddenly became extremely hazy due to yeast settling to the bottom of the bottle. I was curious to see if this would affect the flavor. What was crisp and tart was now a little duller, although the sweetness remained. The flavor seemed a little more dry and the hops seemed less citrusy and more pine-like. It left a slightly dry aftertaste as the hops begin to loiter on my tongue a bit longer than they used to. Overall, the flavor is really satisfying, but perhaps a tad milder than Id prefer. DRINKABILITYMany of the highly-acclaimed American IPAs tend to be so robust theyre for hopheads only. I wouldnt say thats true of Bells Two Hearted Ale. The mouthfeel is surprisingly lighter and thinner than youd expect, and the finish is certainly cleaner. While there is a hop bite, the beer still goes down extremely smooth and is so tasty its difficult not to quaff it all down.At 7% ABV this is what I would consider average potency for an IPA. I drank a bottle on a fairly empty stomach and felt only a slight buzz. The body didnt seem to weigh me down at all. Therefore, Im inclined to believe this beer would pair well with dinner or function as a session beer since it tastes just as good at the end as it does at the beginning, therefore, temperature changes over time is not an issue.FINAL THOUGHTSWhile not the best IPA Ive ever had, Id definitely say Bells Two Hearted Ale was one of the most impressive. I really enjoyed how it combines aspects of the West and East Coast styles to make for one tasty, drinkable beer. This would be a mainstay in my fridge if it were available here.(note: Bells beers are not distributed where I live in upstate New York. This bottle was sent to me from a friend in Michigan so I cannot comment on the price. However, Id say this would be well worth a purchasing price of upwards of $12 a six-pack.)NOTE: Watch the video version of this review at:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyjMo1j5AEk","Lakeland, Florida, USA","ChadPolenz"

Then, red is still bad.  Nice lacing.  Smells of citrus-y, sour grapefruit, dried apricot, fresh-cut grass, with floral and evergreen aromatics.

Hops are big, but the bitterness is tolerable (Im, generally speaking, a malt-head rather than a hopper).  Not a very balanced beer -- I guess thats probably the point.

Decent lacing and a nice, off-white/white-orange frothy head. Smells of citrus and floral hops -- definitely get an orange peel scent, too. Some spices are there, too, but its winter so my nose isnt up to peak performance and I cant draw out exactly what they are. Taste is floral hops with a healthy dose of citrus (grapefruit and some orange) hops, too. The malts dont balance it enough -- there is a hop bitterness that lingers that turns almost metallic as time goes on. A bit over-carbonated, too, but still quite decent.

Its got a nice long finish, not dry at all. Theres a pleasant carbonation to it that I thing makes the sweetness seem not too offensive. Its nothing outstanding but then, this isnt my style.

Pours lightly hazy golden amber with a large foamy & rocky head that leaves nice rings of lacing.  Unbelievable aroma of citrus and tropical fruits, orange, tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, cantaloupe, incredibly complex and powerful aroma.  Flavor is mostly fruit and citrus, a lot of orange/tangerine, somewhat sweet in the middle, medium bitterness on the finish, a hint of alcohol.  A touch watery and a bit of a letdown after the potent aroma.  Still excellent and better than many IPAs.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied, slick, medium carbonation.  

Original Review:
5L mini keg.  Pours orange with a big fluffy white head that leaves clumps of sticky lacing.  Aroma is very nice with a lot of floral and citrus hops.  Flavor is hoppy and sweet, some caramel malt backbone.  Bitterness is on the low end for the style, making this a little different for an IPA but still very enjoyable.  Some bitterness at the end with lingering bitterness in the finish.  Medium carbonation, smooth mouthfeel.  Incredibly drinkable, great session IPA.

It remains  the best  made beers that you can walk in off the street and buy a six of in most any liquor store.  Pours a clear yellow orange under a  half-inch head of white. Nose is big citrus and grape-NeHi hops with a little malt sweetness. First taste is piney resin hops and a quick hop-bitter bite. The citrus hop flavor jumps in quickly with a bitter bite modulated with malty sweetness. This beer works really well. Finish is dry with just a little lingering sweetness and the big pine hops lingering just long enough. Very solid beer.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","allendodd"

The guy who recently rated this a 1 and proceeded to bash others for their use of the word ""balanced"", really needs to reevaluate his own palate.  An IPA doesnt need to strip the enamel off your teeth in order to be successful.  This one is obviously geared more into the floral hops rather than bittering.  Still a killer, nicely balanced IPA.

Ive seen this so often, Ive been putting it off for other things that have been harder to find, and now find myself finally trying it. No disappointment here.

The flavor is similar, and just as good, with more of the caramel sweetness present to smooth it out. Light bodied, and a nice blend of hop bitterness and sweetness from citrus and caramel. Medium to high carbonation. Bitter, toasty, and sweet on the finish. Awesome year-round beer. Re-Rate: Went a wee bit overboard last time.

Pours slightly opaque rusty orange color, nice 1 finger head that sticks around a decent while, excellent lacing. Smells like caramel malt fading on the back side, some floral hops that have most definitely faded over time. Pretty simple here, nothing too complex but nice. Taste follows the smell, but more hoppy than I expected after 6 months of time on it. It still has a decent amount of bitter that doesnt linger which for me personally is nice. Reminiscent of an American Barleywine, sweet and malty, bitter hops, and some citrus qualities too. Some bitter tangerine peel or oils. Finishes creamy and perfectly carbonated. Body is just right, but could use just a touch more oiliness and it would be absolutely perfect.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"

The color is nice, the aroma promising. Poured into a Bells pint glass there is about 2 1/2 inches of foam that subsides in about 2 minutes.

A deep malty aroma with the essence of corn giving way to a citrus like orange and cranberry smell. The beer has a hearty all around ale flavor.

The flavor is also very hops forward, citrus, resinous, much more Centennial and Cascade. Grapefruit bitterness throughout lends to a sweet malt backing. Strong fruit aspects like orange/apricot/ or even pear. Moderatly bitter in finish. Very sessionable although 7%. One of my favorite American IPAs.","Pennsylvania, USA","sarahmarie"

I only recently have gotten into craft beer, let alone beers in general, and the first time I had this beer it was just a bit too strong, too much flavor going on, and I wasnt a fan.  After having had some decent beer I have developed the taste for not only for beers in general, but for IPAs which sometimes seem a bit strong to my palate.  It poured a bit of a yellow/amber color with a white head that seems to be lasting for a while.  It tastes really orangy and hoppy, but its very balanced.  Pretty sweet and quite tasty!

Appearance  Poured into my Sam Adams glass, a bright yellow with a cloudy orange center. A 1 and a half finger fluffy white head with amazingly beautiful lacing and retention. This beer is beautiful, absolutely beautiful. The bubbles flow endlessly from the laser-etching at the bottom; that never gets old!

Smell  This smells like summer. Sweet citrusy notes dominate the nose: tangerines, lemons, mangos, and grapefruits! Has a nice hint of floral hops as well.

Taste  The hop zing from this IPA is absolutely perfect. It hits my tongue the way it wants to be hit, not too hard, but it sure lets you know it is there. The grapefruit and tangerines come through beautifully after the hops do their job. I love this beer.

Mouthfeel  Nice and light, but not too light. It sticks around for a second to let you get the full spectrum of taste that this has to offer, then goes away with a cooling feeling that is refreshing to say the least.

Drinkability  I could drink this all morning, all day, all evening, and all night. Now if only I had a case There is absolutely nothing wrong with this beer, it is amazing, and deserves all the praise in the world.

Palate is a crafty mix of medium bodied heft and careful light caronation, definately fills your mouth.

Palate is pleasantly sharp with the hops up front, just like a real grapefruit is in sharpness. This is a very assertive beer. The malt is doughy-bready, with a good amount of salt & consequent mouth puckering sensation. Finish leans more towards the dry side of things, with the dry grapefruit bitterness having the final say.

Flavor starts off with a strong smack of grapefruit which lasts through the whole tasting. A slight piny flavor kicks in about mid way through and melds with a solid two row malt sweetness ending with a nice dryness and taste bud puckering feeling.  Carbonation is perfect for delivering the flavors, great lacing on the glass and the density is much heavier than it looks all the while not emphasizing the alcohol content at all.

3853,"2009-03-29",4.3,"Pours slightly hazy amber with a 3 finger chunky off white heat that has great retention and leaves nice lacing. Aroma is huge on fresh citrus and pine hops, there are some floral notes in there but citrus dominates. Theres also melon, strawberry taffey, light caramel, toast, straw, a tiny bit of sour malt. Flavor is really hard to beat. Starts off with light caramel, berries and grapefruit. Then hints of apple, mandarin orange, citrus and pine hops, fresh honeydew melon and starfruit. Finish is bitter grapefruit, burnt sugar, melon and hints of pine. Palate is perfect for the style starts out slightly creamy medium to light thickness and lively but not overbearing carbonation, juicy and refreshing in the middle and slightly drying but still a little sweetness for the finish. Overall I have to say this is one of the best IPAs I have had I just wish it were more readily available in my area since I hadnt seen it for 3 years or so before today.","Clinton, Iowa, USA","fidelis83"

Most balanced IPA I have had to date.  Had this beer many times before but figured that I should take the time this evening to rate the beer.  Nice lacing on the glass for an IPA.  Bit of citrus but being that this IPA is so balanced it does not overpower anything else.  Nice amount of head that sticks around just like it should.  Hard to drink this one slow.

Nice grapefruit finish, but it takes a little while to come to the forefront, developing rather slowly.  This one was from batch 8678, packaged on August 13, 2008, so about half a year of age on this, so I may have to see if I can lay hands on a less than one month old one at some point and re-rate it, as I thoroughly enjoyed it, but would love to taste it even fresher.","Poughkeepsie, New York, USA","j12601"

A mix of floral and pine on the tongue from the hops with some bread from the malt.  The hops and malt are in perfect balance for the style.  Finishes with a lingering bitterness.

Smells of hops, a little malt, lemony citrus, and some floral arrangement to it. The only thing Ive had compare in smell was Hopslam, also by Bells. Surprisingly though, the taste was mediocre. Weak and watery, with similar flavors to the smell, except much less hops and malt. Somewhat smooth going down, but quite disappointing.

Aroma of floral hops, honey, grapefruit and some white sugar. Appearance is golden with frothy white head that stayed until the end.

Overall:  For an IPA not made on the west coast, this beer has a great level of citrus aroma and flavor, and has a nice level of malt to compliment it.  I look forward to brewing my first extract batch of beer, based off of this recipe.","Los Angeles County, California, USA","LtDan"

I can’t say it is the most even taste. I can’t even say that it is consistent even in one glass. This, however, is the beauty of it.  On tap isn’t that much better than in the bottle in comparison to other beers.

Pours a hazy amber with a huge billowy white head that shows no signs of dying. Aromas are largely medium citrusy hops and sweet malts. Initial taste is bitter hoppiness up front, pine and citrus mixed with a touch of spice, leading up to a delicate yet assertive malt balance. Finishes with a smooth body but nice bitter taste. Medium to lighter bodied finish. The hops steal the show in this brew and I personally really enjoy the more one dimensional hop feel. Assertive and non-messy.

TECHNICAL: Bottle. Poured a light to medium orange with a small, slightly off-white head that mostly diminished, but left good lacing. The aroma was light caramel malt and moderate to heavy pine and citrus (grapefruit and more orange) hops. The initial flavor was lightly sweet and bitter, and moderately acidic; while the finish was moderately sweet and heavy to almost harshly bitter with a long duration. There was orange, grapefruit and pine hops with a little caramel malt. The medium body was sorta creamy with fizzy carbonation and a moderate astringent finish.","Wilmington, Delaware, USA","Heathen"

First rate: My thanks to 2nd Lieutennant nbutler11 (retired) for the use of his bottle.  Had this (not immediately, but soon) after Founders Harvest.  Overall, I found this sharper and shallower.

The fragrance is strong with citrus fruits (oranges tend to stick out with a hint of grapefruit).  Also, the glorious hop has a strong presence in the aroma.

I can sum up Bells Two Hearted Ale in three words: soft. Floral. Smooth.

Maybe not what one would initially think when thinking IPA, but that is taking into consideration Two Hearted is an IPA. I love my 90 Minute, but Two Hearted has nudge her into second place. This is, quite finely, the best IPA I have drunk to date.

Bright orange and amber, citrusy herbal hop perfume caresses my nose. A very powerful oily hop presence makes itself known before taking even one sip. And then the surprise. Bright crisp citrus and flowery hops fill my taste buds, but softly and with a very smooth body (creamy). The oils coat my mouth, rounding out into a bitter burst on the very center of my tongue. Amazing. Such a strong head, and yet such a delicate balance of hoppy IPA character - flowers, citrus, and pepper. Its like Two Hearted is trying to say to me ""hey. Im here. Im hoppy. Im delicious and complex, more than just a hop bomb being dropped blindly on your senses. Take note of the subtle characters and flavors that make me such a delicious IPA. One sip, and I know you will understand.""

Quite a good IPA.","Mountville, Pennsylvania, USA","afireinside96"

Awesome!","Portland, Oregon, USA","Angeloregon"

Flavor is subdued malt, with hops on the front and finish of this one.  It could be very refreshing, not as harsh as some overhopped IPAs can be.  The hops in this one seem ""fresher"" with less bitter bite, and more bitter flavor.  Mostly floral hops, but there are some piny and citrus flavors as well.

Nice, slightly cloudy orange/pale color that looks light and weak but is nothing but the opposite. Nice balance  considering all you smell is hops and the 1st thing on your palate is hops. It smooths out nicely and finishes with a floral, hoppy, fruity taste that reminds me of Manderin oranges.

Pours the color of a well-polished dooknob with some grapefruity hoppiness.  Pillowy head.

How: Tap at Surly Girl Saloon (Columbus Ohio)
The look: Clear golden blonde body with a small white head
In long: Nose of grapefruits and pineapples.  Taste is rather intense with more of the same as the aroma (grapefruits and pineapples).  The beer is well balanced but the malt-related flavours/sweetness stay in the back.  A light-medium tartness/acidity.  Aggressive carbonation.  This beer is as tasty as it is refreshing, dangerously drinkable.  I cannot think of a way to make time fly more quickly than drinking that beer, except maybe for being in a coma.","Montreal, Quebec, CANADA","Glouglouburp"

The aroma is very hop heavy, my nose actually got a little frightened over the expected bitterness.

The taste revealed a much more balanced hop-malt tasste, and a pleasant underlying floral influence. Much better than I expected from the scent (not that the scent was bad, mind you; I was just expecting something far more bitter)

The most amazingly perfect smelling beer Ive put my nose to, amazing floral and citrus hoppiness, just the right amount of malt to form the base for the hops to work their magic. Perfect head with tight bubbles. Flavor maybe could be a 10 as well with all those luscious tangy hops dancing across the tongue, just didnt quite live up to that aroma for me, but I dont think anything could have.

3853,"2008-05-13",4.0,"Nice lighter IPA (i consider this more of a good pale ale).  Reviewing this as a hoppy pale ale (not an IPA), I like the dryness of this beer and how that helps highlight the citric/floral notes of the hops in the beer.  Ive had the beer in bottle and on tap and prefer the tap as the cleaness and crisp hops come through better.  This is a very nice pale ale!

Awesome, awesome aroma...it just beckons to you! Flavor of hops upfront, followed by sweet malt with some wheat notes at the finish.  Also got some lemon zest.

Spicy floral hops dominate, bit of pine resin and touch of alcohol.

Light, but not too light, sweet malt (biscuity, hint of caramel) underscored by floral bittering throughout.  Bit of woodsy spice builds at the finish to give it a little bite.

6/14/2010 - Hadnt had this forever, then on a really fresh tap a few times. Definitely better than remembered, the exquisite balance reminiscent of Nugget Nectar except a lot more fresh tropical fruits and less caramel malt.

Flavor is balanced unlike any other IPA Ive tasted to this date- citrus and herbal hoppiness slowly emerges rather than hitting you in the face and is accompanied by mellow caramel, dried fruit, and some tartness.  Finish is nicely bitter, but certainly not one of the more bitter beers I have sampled.

The beer is very pretty with a large lasting fluffy white head, that leaves a good lace, the color is dark gold to light orange.

3853,"2008-04-28",3.8,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2008 Poured a bright orange with a dense 2-finger foamy head that lingered for ages and left very good lacing.  The slightest swirl sends the head back up to a finger.  Nice.  The fruits leapt out of the bottle at me - oranges, grapefruits, lemons, etc. A slight piny, grassy scent could be detected under the floral fruits, as well as a slightly sweet malt base.  Clean, crisp taste that was dominated by the floral and citrus side of things. Quite a zing on the taste buds. I caught a little bit of the malt in the background, but not much. Zesty.  Medium bodied with a decent clean finish with only the slightest bitterness in the aftertaste.  This is a great example of an IPA, though it was probably a litle bit on the fruity side to be in my top few IPAs.  Nonetheless, a well crafted brew from Bells.","Atlanta, Georgia, USA","GAManiac"

3853,"2008-04-26",4.1,"A- Pours a golden yellow hue with a 1.5 finger eggshell head which leaves a good amount of lacing when it fades. Not to much carbonation is visible.

S- Smells is prodomenately grapefruit and citrus hops, also there is a bready, malty backbone

T- Much more tame than I was expecting but in a good way. Exquisitely balanced grapefruit hops that end sweet and malty. I like this one because even though it has a defined hop presence, it really doesnt overpower anything.

M- Medium bodied, with carbonation a little on the low side for my tastes but this doesnt detract from the brew overall.

D- This is a hugely drinkable IPA. I love IPAs and DIPAs with the grapefruit/citrus hops and this one has that in spades. Its well balanced but my only beef with it is theres nothing that really jumps out and grabs me about it. Would be great (and deadly) to session.","California, USA","Lothore"

Citrusy, with aromas of ruby red grapefruit, and a hint of malt sweetness in the background and maybe some cut grass. This smells very fresh and springlike. 

What a perfectly balanced beer. Lovely hops and fruit flavors perfectly balanced with a slightly sweet maltiness that perfectly compliments the hops. This is exceptional!

Bells 2 Hearted IPA/Ale is a very hoppy yet well balanced IPA. Dont get me wrong, its hoppy, but Im a hophead so well balanced in an IPA means theres a lot of bitterness but an uder laying tone of malty sweetness.

Citrus and hops again. Slight malts towards the finish. Hop oils remain through the finish and into the aftertaste. This is a bitter one but inline with the style.

Nice malt backbone also present in the aroma.  The taste is nice and balanced.  First you get the piney and citrusy taste (a lot likely due to the aroma) and then a nice dose of a solid malt backbone.  Hops come back in for the finish with a nice bitter (but still fresh) finish.  While the malt backbone does a great job balancing all the hops this beer is all about the hops.  Great fresh hops (wait did I say they were fresh yet).  It really doesnt get any better for any IPA.  Medium bodied with a decent dose of carbonation.

Aroma is very tropical, with orange and pineapple hoppiness.

Flavors echo the fruity hops of the aroma, with fresh pineapple followed by a decent dose of bitterness. Not too much malt, maybe a bit of yeasty dough.

Medium-light body, a little undercarbonated, dry, not particularly clean finish. Supremely drinkable.","San Francisco, California, USA","illidurit"

But, somehow, I just cannot see how 2 Hearted warrants a #2 rating.  I mean, it is a great beer, but the 2nd best IPA?  So, I put it to a small test.  Tonight in a blind taste test, it whipped Victory Hop Devil and previously it beat 60 Min. IPA, Goose Island IPA, Commodore Perry IPA and Avery IPA.  2 Hearted is big, complex and full of citrusy hop flavor from beginning to end.  A very solid, crisp easy drinking yet satisfying beer.","Kettering, Ohio, USA","Maddog"

3853,"2008-02-19",4.0,"Floral hops indeed. Some earth and grapefruit too. Its nice to have an IPA that leans towards floral hops as opposed to citrusy ones. Got a spicy kick in there as well.

Two hearted also happens to bitter and aroma their beer with one of my personal favorite hops Centennial.   The beer pours a perfect clear darker golden color.  The head is thick white and lacy that seems to linger on the glass as much as the aroma does.  The aroma is all hops, hops, and more fantastic hops.  The taste is definitely that signature centennial hops palate: earthy, spicy, and piney all in one.  TOP NOTCH!","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","hophead82"
3853,"2008-02-19",4.3,"Finally had a chance to give this a try, living in Illinois has its disadvantages.  I was a little worried that I would be let down by this, but I wasnt - a very well made and balanced IPA with a fuzzy hoppy backbone.  On tap IPAs seem to settle down a bit, and I think thats what made this even better.  I would drink this all the time if i could.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","WickerBrew"

3853,"2008-02-17",4.0,"Pours a delectable amber gold with retained bubbly white head and some minor spotty lacing.  Every stage of the beer is dominated by hops: from the pungent, musky aroma (strangely, or subliminally, reminiscent of fish scales), to the citrusy, well-attenuated palate, to the final resiny quinine-bitter finish, all steps of the way point to hops.

The beer is a cloudy orange coloration with a minimal white head.  It is easy to drink because the alcohol isnt noticeable.

Beer poured an orangey color, absolutely huge, foamy head. There was so much lacing, it was more like the head clinging to the glass than normal lacing. The flavor was citrusy, but not just grapefruity, like other IPAs. Some sweetness from malt, caramel maybe and fruit and a perfect amount of bitterness. But the real highlight is the mouthfeel. This beer has the creaminess Id put up against any stout on draft or pale ale on cask anywhere. Phenomenal. I honestly dont think its possible to do an IPA better than this.

Really resiny hop.  Piney grapefruit.  Some sherbert.  Then I tasted it.  Fairly thin and sharp in mouth.  Some decent fruit on end.  A pretty decent IPA.  Pretty easty to drink, malts are ok.

re-rate courtesy of ucusty:
Pours with a hazy yellow body with an off-white head that leaves strong lacing. Aroma of grapefruity hops, toffee, some apple, lemon hops and a bit of barnyard (odd). Taste is a very malty and balanced IPA. Liveley carbonation. Ar:8 Ap:8 F:8 M:4 O:18 (odd that the re-rate is the same as the original).

Aromas are floral, citrusy, grapefruit, tangerine, light pine. Medium iced tea. Light bready, caramel malt structure. Pretty clean ester wise. Flavors are of citrus, pine, grapefruit, corn nuts.

Smells of strong florals and citrus with a heavy dose of mangoes or apricots.  Pretty highly carbonated.  Orange or mango taste with the bitter hitting at the end.  Surprisingly subdued bitter considering the amount of hops in the nose.  It is a nice earthy citrus hops.  The carbonation gives it a good thick body.

Pours a lightly hazy orange amber with a smallish bubbly/creamy white head. Good lacing. Aroma is brilliant, lots of hops. Lemons, grapefruit, pine, lavender, flowers and a little crystal-maltiness behind it. Low carbonation. Flavour is mildly bitter at first, then expands with a well-balanced malty base of sweetness, then finishes medium dry with a good powerful hop addition. Grapefruit hops are most apparent, so are lemony and grassy hops.","Kolding, DENMARK","thewolf"
3853,"2007-12-31",4.2,"12oz bottle from ealdent. Pours a deep, golden orange with a slight haze and wisps of cloudiness. The head is thick and white, and it is relatively long-lived. The aroma is fantastic - a bouquet of hops, particularly citrus and floral smells. There is some malt sweetness in the aroma, too. The flavor follows the nose starting bittersweet with sweet crystal malts and a big citrus and earthy bitterness. The middle of the tongue picks up more bitterness - more earthy and herbal than citrus - and is still well balanced by malts. The ester profile is fairly clean. The finish is dry and bitter with notes of grapefruit juice. The mouthfeel is medium in body, creamy, and crisp; the carbonation is just right. Overall, a delicious American IPA.","Tyrone, Georgia, USA","jhumphries69"

Very floral nose, reminiscent of Rogue or Stone (definitely west coast) but a little more floral, not as grainy.  This knocked me on my bum just with the nose.  The great thing about this beer is its not too hoppy, not too bitter.  My partner, a decided stout, porter and lambic woman, also loved this, and she tends to eschew the hoppier ones that make me have to sit down.

The aroma was full of somewhat sharp flowery hops with citrus in the background.  Flavor is milder than expected, but absolutely deliciously balanced.  Its mildly sweet with a smattering of grapefruit and a little pine on top of the crisp bitterness of the hops.  The mouthfeel is delicously silky and crisp.  This is an interesting beer to me.

This was the best beer available at the festival.  Ive had it a couple of times now; this was just as good as I remember it being in the past.  Hopefully this makes as much money for Bells as it deserves.  While it is not quite the best IPA (that honor currently goes to Alesmith) it is certainly not second rate.  Not only is it excellent you should find it almost everywhere.
Aroma / Appearance - The golden yellow body had a nice tint as the sun trickled through it.  A white clean head sat on top gracefully guarding the beer beneath.  By now my nose was not quite as fresh as it was earlier in the afternoon but I was still able to pick up freshly mowed glass, orange rinds and aggressive hops.
Flavor / Palate - Bitter orange chocolate highlights the first sip.  Next comes wheat and lemons mixed with dry spices.  The hoppiness is very strong making this ideal for waking up the palate halfway through an evening.  It is almost aggressive enough to be an imperial IPA but not quite.","Chagrin Falls, Ohio, USA","Brigadier"

3853,"2007-08-29",4.0,"Bottle. (from trade with the_epeeist) Golden, almost clear body, under a white head leaving nice lacings. Piney, citrusy, beef-stock malty nose with resin as well. Even though the flavor is on the hoppy side, theres a balance to it, and I like it. It has a nice level of bitterness, with the usual flavors from the hops, and a good dash of malts. It could maybe have a little bit fuller body, but Im not holding it against it. The finish is long, resiny and fruity, with a nice bitterness. Lovely, really lovely IPA.

3853,"2007-08-28",4.1,"UPDATED: JUL 3, 2009 12 oz bottle, poured.  Close to orange coloring, short white head, with decent lacing on the glass  I would like to start by saying this is not what I expected from this beer.  I especially disliked what was left on the palate.  It was almost too bitter for my tasting, which I dont understand.  It was definitely a very floral aroma, and the taste to go with it.  Very hoppy with the back taste of malt.  Aside from the Amber Ale, this is my least favorite brew from Bells, and it pains me to say that.

4.09.2008 Edit

In light of my previous rating, I would like to amend something I stated.  This is not as bad as I made it sound.  I started drinking it more regularly and actually liked it a lot.  If you feel the way I did after my first try, give it another.  It has grown on me very nicely.","St. Clair Shores, Michigan, USA","lunchbox582"
3853,"2007-08-28",4.5,"UPDATED: SEP 28, 2008 Copper orange with finger sized head and good lacing.  Floral piney hops and quiet citrus aromas mark this brew and presented a hoppy, but not dominating scent.  The perfumey/floral hops are prevalent on the taste but are extremely well balanced by cereal malts, citrus and caramel sweetness.  This is one of the best IPAs I have ever had because of its directness, and its beautiful balance.  While I do enjoy a strongly hopped IPA, I prefer one which is in harmony with other factors in order to produce a great and well-balanced brew.","Miami, Florida, USA","cbeers21"

The flavor is much the same with the citrus fruits and hops. The hops arent overpowering at all which is good, but they let you know they are there. The citrus fruits and malt backbone give this a nice sweet flavor to go with the hop bitterness in the finish. It was a medium bodied beer with a nice long crisp finish to it.

3853,"2007-08-22",4.5,"Bottle--First of all, give me a chance to get past the excitement.  There I am rummaging through the singles at the local produce market (it carries a fine number of beers, only a mile from the house).  I spy, sitting quietly all the way at the end of the counter, actually in the area behind a display stand are two six packs of Bells Brewery product.  Now, that cant be right, Ive heard that Bells is distributed in Florida but Ive yet to come across it.  Ive already faced disappointment that since Bells isnt sold in Illinois, Bells failed to arrive in my home after the famous 1000 mile beer run in July.  Now as I look closer at the six pack, sure enough the label and the bottle cap both indicate that this is the real stuff.  Great, superb and holy cow, its going in my cart.  Staring at the cart, I start to chuckle, wow, bananas, grapes, cantaloupe and beer, this will be make for an interesting story at the check out counter and to my wife.  

Wait a minute, whats the price?  I know Im buying the six pack no matter what, unless it costs something ridiculous.  Its then I notice thats no price on the shelf.  Wheres the beer guy, hmmmm, no where to be found.  What if the beer is part of his secret stash?  No, its on the shelf with other beer that is priced marked, so maybe not.  What if it doesnt ring up at the cash register, well then, I guess Ill have a great conversation with the beer guy about how he needs to get more Bells product on the shelf.  

I wheel the cart into the checkout line and here I am at the register, it rings up with no questions ask.  I giddily hop out to my car and several hours later, there it sits in my beer glass, waiting to be consumed.  

What about the beer, you say, shouldnt you describe the taste, the smell and the look of the beer.  Na, a thousand others have come before me.  Lets just say that the beer lived up to every one of its ninety-ninth percentile rating.  

So, just be happy with the story of the discovery of an excellent beer and be happy that not only it exists, but it is available to a large number of people all across the country, and isnt that whats this whole experience is about?

Postscript:  the beer fridge is full with Goose Island, Three Floyds, Bells, Dogfish and several Belgium beers, I guess that Florida (even though several where driven into the state), isnt that big of a beer wasteland anymore!

Ive had the pleasure of drinking this one from the bottle, a regular keg, and a 5L home mini-keg, and the draft format works alot better with this beer.  The orange hops really ""pop"" and taste much fresher from the tap.  Likewise, the pour imparts a larger, fuller head, more intricate lacing, and a smoother, less sticky palate.  Im beginning to think I might have had a bad bottle for the first go round.  Awesome IPA.Original rating August 2007. Bottle at Redlight Redlight.  Courtesy boboski.  The body is a cloudy orange-amber color.  It looks rather syrupy, with thick legs like a desert wine would have.  Not much of a head, just a thin wispy film with a pure white buildup around the rim of the glass.  The aroma is obviously hoppy and piney, but there is plenty of caramel and toffee malt to balance it out.  The flavor has alot of orange in it, with grapefruit and pine resin both playing prominent roles.  There is obviously a high sugar content, as the palate is quite thick and sticky.  A little too sticky in my opinion.  A very nice IPA, but a little less sugary malts would make it ideal.","Orlando, Florida, USA","Beerlando"

Very quaffable, as the citrus and malt combine for a perfectly round and smooth mouthfeel.  Pine resin lingers in the finish, peppering the back of the mouth with a decent IBU.  Again, the drinkability is very much the biggest ""pro"" of this brew.  IPAs are my fave (as are doubles and impys), and this one doesnt disappoint.

It is blended so well, the complexity, the smoothness, the layers of malt that fold in your mouth.  Great aromas that you can smell from 5 feet away.  Just a perfect blend! Everytime I have it, I expect the best, and it delivers everytime...almost better every time.
Pours great cloudy burnt orange with great lacing and nice long lasting off white head.  Extreme citrus notes on smelling and tasting.  Great bright flavor of hops, sooo citrusy.  Bitterness is lacking a little on the backend, but leaves a great refreshing clean taste afterwords.  The malt character gets exposed, with a great ""unique"" round semi sweet taste, just as the hops start doing the work.  Great, Great brew","Crestwood, Illinois, USA","JLAudio"

Poured a light amber color and smelled of pure hoppiness (no, not that beer from Alpine, which I havent had by the way).  Lots of grapefruit and pine present here.  Though Im generally not much of a hops guy, this is the type I enjoy most.  Ive heard stories about how insanely drinkable this beer is, but   I didnt know how true it was until I took my first...well all my sips.  The grapefruitiness jumps out at first, followed by malt support to give it balance.  The finish brings the hops back, as if I had forgotten what I was drinking.  A nice lingering bitter to this one, but not overwhelming.  Truly well done.  My new favorite IPA/IIPA, unless you count Houblon, which I dont...so there.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","MaxxDaddy"
3853,"2007-07-02",4.2,"Draught at HDG.  Light orange/amber colored with an aroma of what seemed like a truckload of bright grapefruity hops.  The hoppiness struck me before the glass came within a foot of my nose.  Reminiscent of Hopslam.  The bright hops are obviously the star of the show, but the full and clean cookie/caramel malts provide a nice structure which supports and balances this fine green-flowery nectar. Interestingly, the hoppiness seems to start out like fresh grapefruit zest on the initial sip and morphs into more of a pine charater towards the finish.  However, theres no resin or astringency.  Im pretty sure that this is the best single IPA Ive had so far.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","sheatripper"

Color is clear orange with a nice lacing white head. Subdued bitterness, well balanced hop flavor with a very smooth palate. Hops show up all over the flavor but dont provide any harsh bitterness that is the downfall of so many IPAs. Sweet orange, musky pine, and just the perfect balance of sweet and bitter. Palate works perfectly for the style, providing one of the best examples of how to perfectly accentuate a hop-heavy beer.","Austin, Texas, USA","slimchill"

3853,"2007-06-18",4.1,"My first taste of this was in bottle at Brickskeller in DC last year, and then again in bottle in Minneapolis in the winter, and now on my recent visit back to Minneapolis I see that its showing up on tap all over dive bars in Minneapolis.  This really makes me smile.  What an awesome beer.  Defines the true midwestern IPA style.  Pours with a nice clean, white head that dissapates quickly.  Nice and dry without a lot of cloying sweetness or nutty base malt character, which is perfect for this style.  And really delivers on the hops, cirtus, pine, with a touch of grapefruit..  If I had to guess - A mix of old standbys like cascade, and some new school hops like centennial, amarillo and maybe some traditional british hops such as fuggle or EKG.  Great complexity.  Can certainly compete with some great west coast IPAs.  Very well done, Bells.  Thank you for making my visits to the Midwest feel just a little more like home.","Oakland, California, USA","nahthan"

Something about it is intimidating to me, even next to Dogfishs 90 and 120, as well as the Crooked Trees, Hopslam and even Founders Devil Dancer.  I cant explain why, but Ill try.  Something about the strong citrusy nose and hoppy aromas, the punch to the palate with more bitterness throughout the tastes of grapefruit peel and pine.  I mightve topped off a busy bar night long ago with this IPA, which could be why it is such a hard one to put away consistently nowadays.  A manly beer.  I cant even say I enjoy it so much as respect it.","Juneau, Alaska, USA","leeburg"
3853,"2007-06-10",3.9,"The aroma was strong caramel with a fruity and citrusy orange/grapefruit presence. Hop aromas dominated with malt taking a backseat. The malty sweetness was light and the citrus presence was strong. In the glass the beer was slightly hazy golden amber with an off-white frothy head which laced the glass. The flavor was strongly centered on citrus, orange/grapefruit most notable.  Along with the hop flavor came a strong bittering and some caramel but the malt presence was not overly sweet. The flavor was also lightly bready. The body was medium and the carbonation left the beer creamy in texture. The citrusy hops lasted long into the aftertaste. A very nice pint!

That is what gives it distiction.   It has a charm a lot of other IPAs dont have.  Also doesnt have the maltyness of say dogfish head ipas.  Very distinctive IPA.  My favorite everyday beer.

Pine, hops, lime and other citrus, sweet maltiness....but without big heavy bite. Its still sticky, but not in an overbearing sense. Crisp dry finish. This is like diet IPA in that it is so much a session beer, despite its 7% (damn you Bells and your ability to mask alcohol). A staple as far as IPAs go. This is the real deal....still extremely enjoyable and stable as it warms up. This edges out the Titan from Great Divide, simply by beeing a smoother and lighter beer....oh and the obvious fact that the two hearted manages to slam you with so much hop flavor in the process.

3853,"2007-06-05",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 5, 2008 This is a damn good and flavorful IPA.

Pours a cloudy mango amber into my imperial pint glass. Big fluffy head, with lots of sticky lacing. Aroma is great; soft piney hops (but strong and prevalent), cider, pineapple.

Pours a  yellow orange haze of a beer, but i dont know if its possible to see it through the aroma.  Its massive, and a fresh bottle of this will floor any hop-head.  The taste is fresh citrus, grapefruit, and if the color green had a taste, i think it would be something like this.  Wonderful.

On the nose: bright hops: citrus, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon zest even a hint of pine. Theres also some rich maltiness hiding there as well. Wonderfully vibrant on the palate and quite full bodied. Very complex flavor profile: instantly struck by the hops but some rich, sweet toffee/caramel-like malt flavors are hiding behind the hop attack. Excellent all around beer. Some are hoppier, some are maltier and some are more complex, but Two Hearted is very, very well balanced and quite drinkable. Close to perfection and insanely drinkable.","SLP, Minnesota, USA","tyler_mn"
3853,"2007-05-30",3.6,"Large head.  Aroma is rich with spice and hops, but you can tell it is also just slightly thin/watery.  A little too light for my taste in the finish, just a little too much water, a touch too long of a finish, especially with this much hop bitter at the end.  I just think if it has that much in the way of hops, the finish should be a little quicker/dryer.  Overall a good beer, but I was just a little disappointed in the aroma/finish department.","Canton, Ohio, USA","TyRip"

Taking that into account I loved this beer. Poured a smooth peachy amber with a medium thin, creamy, white head with a slowly receding lace. The aroma was hoppy above all else, very sweet and very fruity, definite citrus. Absolutely tantalizing. The flavor was sweet, fruity, and they hops were masterfully done. Not over the top, very well maintained. The palate was bitter at the back of my mouth. God I loved this IPA. I literally could not stop drinking it.","Chapel Hill, North Carolina, USA","emacgee"
3853,"2007-05-21",4.1,"Bottle dated 4 weeks old.

Poured a delicious looking hazed orange-gold ale in the glass with a puffy 3 finger white cap that lasts and laces the glass well.

Aromas are delightful: sweet malts under grape fruit tones and floral aromas...a light earthy mustiness...very much like Anchor Liberty but more pronounced.

Flavor and Mouth -Feel Profile: 

The delivery:
....up front thick caramelized malts to chew on which are almost instantly balanced off with a ceadr-citrus bittering. Silken mouth feel.

Mid palate: 
....you get some complexity of tastes as the hop alphas and yeast by-products produce some interesting succulent fruits-pine-citrus peel tones that blend with the sweet rich breadiness of the malts, much like a tart-floral marmalade on toast...perfect balance in this ""big"" rich full bodied ale.

The finish: 
...malt-hop balance slowly dissipates as the long finish becomes slowly more bitter an floral with a final light citrus peel after taste and a light warming from the 7%ABV.

A very well put together American styled IPA...not exactly in the Pacific NW style but it bears many characteristcs. tThe nose and flavor are infused with a wonderful hop mixture that indicates both hopback infusion and dry hopping. Smooth, Big flavor, well balanced, drinkable and satifying. This ale has all you ask for in a daily beer.","Hopville, Ontario, CANADA","pootzboy"

Mouthfeel is medium thick and really smooth with a creamy finish. Flavor is an intense mixture of malts and hops, truly remarkable.

Pine, hops, spice and grapefruit dominate. Back of the tongue is more of the same, with the floral notes shining through. Finish is crisp, dry and bitter. Full of hops.

Smells VERY hoppy with some pine and spicy smells mixed in. It pours a cloudy copper with a light brown head.

According to Bells website it was packaged 9/25/06. So it should be nice and fresh.

Two Hearted poured a slightly hazy gold. A good looking 1+finger white micro bubble head. Swirling carbonation rising from a few different points in my pint glass.

All I smell coming from this beer is hops, which is a very good thing. I smell a forest of pine trees and grapefruit. Makes my mouth water.

There is a small malt backbone coming through but its mostly a hop attack. My kind of IPA. Citrus(grapefruit) hops followed by a mouthful of oily pine needles. A nice bitterness follows that gets me ready for the next drink.

Mouthfeel is a little on the lighter side but still good. Its funny but even though its lighter it still coats my mouth. Nice amount of carbonation.

Drinkability is good. I could and have drank quite a few of these in a sitting.

The taste is just perfect- fruity, perfume hops, without any astringent bitterness. Just amazing. Malts are then as a great backbone, but this beer is about the hops as it should be. The approachableness of the hops is what really sets this apart from the crowd. Any average non hop head can have a sip of this and say- this is a really tasty beer. That is an accomplishment that cant be understated- for the masses and for the hop head.

The bottled and draught versions of Bells Two Hearted Ale are  surprisingly identical in all ways.  This beer pours a copper color with hues of brown, red, orange, and golden yellow.  It has a creamy, near white head that has good retention and leaves a little bit of lacing on the glass.  The hoppy aroma is a nice bouquet of citrus, grapefruit, pine, floral notes, and some malt.  The initial  moderate malt sweetness is followed by a hefty dose of bitterness and the same hop flavors that were in the aroma, only stoner.  The bitterness lasts through the crisp finish and then some.  The body is medium to full and is smooth and slick on the palate.  Overall this is a well balanced, but intense IPA.  It has a tendency to wreck the palate after drinking a few of these!  Bells Two Hearted Ale is a  is probably best fresh in order to experience its wonderful hoppy aroma and flavor at their peak!  Bells does not disappoint and the Two Hearted Ale is one of their best mainstream brews...","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","shigadeyo"

Its full, but not fat or bloated in the mouth. Perfectly carbonated, keeping it light, but not thin... just right. When it hits your tounge, its citrus bitter, rolling directly into sweet shortbread and vanilla malts. Plenty of fruit character shows, with some apricot and other fleshy stone fruits. The hop flavor doesnt back off though, its there, and very strong, a lucious mix of citrus fruits, grapefruit, satsumas (mmmm) and the lovely spring like flavor of flower petals.

3853,"2007-01-10",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 10, 2007 On cask (yes, cask) at the Happy Gnome in St. Paul, MN. The aroma is strongly citrus-hoppy, and that is great for a hops lover like me. Pours a clear amber with virtually no head. The flavor is very pleasantly hoppy. There are slight fresh apple notes. The hops overwhelm the other flavors. Overall, I would characterize the taste as subdued, which is a strange thing to say about a hops-oriented legend like Two Hearted. The beer is very smooth and undercarbonated, producing a dull effect in the palate, likely an effect of the cask. This dull texture is a poor complement to the sharp hops. I definitely prefer the traditional non-cask version. I had Two Hearted a few weeks ago on non-cask tap. I didnt rate it formally, but I figured at the time that it would have earned about a 4.

<P>Re-rate, 2-18-07: I tried Two Hearted again last night, this time in an approximately 4 oz. sample poured from a 12 oz. bottle at an American IPA tasting hosted by tennisjoel. It was the sixth of ten that we tried. Of the five of those ten that I had previously rated, this is the only one that I am re-rating, as it is the only one whose rating would have changed substantially. Clean-smelling, hoppy aroma features citrus (lemon, grapefruit) and pine. Pours a clear golden amber with a moderate amount of white head and good legs. Flavor of candy lemon sour hops; extremely citrusy. Like a hoppy limoncello, and I mean that as a compliment. Sharp and lively in the palate (a welcome upgrade from the dull cask experience); medium body. This is just a very good beer. Two Hearted is not quite as good as the wonderful HopSlam, but it does show a strong family resemblance. It came in second place on my ballot among the ten in the IPA tasting (to Surly Furious).

Cask pour at Pizzeria Paradiso, 9/15/07.  Golden, dry aroma of cantaloupe, pear juice, marginal floral tones.  Dusty flavor.  Hints of light fruits, lacking the crisp centennial bite in a vague way.  Palate takes no benefit from this particular run in the cask.  Overaged, as well.  

Tap at the Afterwords Cafe 9/19/07.  Floral grind disseminates fully and brightly in the aroma.  The hop taste is smoky, meaty and rich.  Almost perfect pleasantry.  Vanilla-kissed toffee in a balancing malt finish.  

Tap at the Afterwords Cafe 10/31/07. That comforting touch of rose essence is right out in front. 

Tap at the Happy Gnome 1/20/08.  Vibrant and fresh as can be, bursting with cantaloupe, pear, and honeydew melon soaked in the morning floral mist.   Crispy, cool, and perfect.

Huge centennial hop aroma that is just great!!  Big floral and spicy notes from the hops as well.  the flavor has a nice bitterness to it that compliments the spicy floral notes of the hops.  this is an excellent example of how to brew an ipa.

3853,"2006-09-02",4.1,"This beer is beautifully crafted to be one of the most tasty easy drinking IPAs I have had to date. Thanks to YBSober for this beer.

Appearance: Pours a magnificent orange peach color with a huge head that lasts and lasts. Then heavy sheets of lacing decorate the glass.

Smell: Tons of fresh orange rinds. I cracked open the bottle and even before I poured the beer my wife asked (from across the room) ""Is that an orange beer?"" It is that bold in the initial orange citrus aroma. It settles to a perfect level of citric orange rind and sweet toasted malt.

Taste: If you have ever juiced your own oranges in a juicer you can peel off the top orange layer and leave the white rinds on the orange that you juice. It makes a more bold tart tasty fresh orange juice. This beer reminded me of that juice I used to make. My juicer is still in the attic from when we moved. I think it will stay there and I will get more of this Two Hearted Ale. Wow!

Mouthfeel: So remarkably smooth. A bit juicy with just a bit of a hop nibble keeping the medium/light body interesting. 

Drinkability: Now that I have met this beer, buy stock in Bells Brewery because I am on a quest for cases. I could drink this all day everyday. It really hits the spot and is remarkably easy to drink!

Hope this is helpful.

A gorgeous orange color with a massively beautiful white head that lasts throughout the drankin experience. Wonderful floral hop aroma with hints of pine. Deliciously bitter with tons of fresh green hop tastes. The thing about this beer is that it slowly becomes delicious liquid adult candy as it warms. I get a noticeable candy orange taste in the background that reminds me of orange Pez candy.

You say Im used to all that extreme West Coast IPA. Well, yes and no. This just doesnt have that IPA bite to it. But I digress. Aroma is malty, yes and hoppy.

3853,"2006-07-04",4.4,"Still catching up on the beers I got from the_Epeeist in trade. Thanks! Almost no head, what there is, is white and disappears immediately. Certainly not a West Coast IPA. I almost think there should be a new category of IPAs for the SoCal IPAs, but that might put the purists off a little too much. SD IPAs have a truckload more malt than this, and an obvious overload of hops. There is a crisp hop finish to be sure, and an exceptional balance when it comes to flavor and in the nose. An expertly crafted IPA without doubt. Yet, as a resident of San Diego, I cannot help but wonder if the makers of this beer would have been influenced on the hop-side by what is going on around here. My personal struggle is that my introduction to IPAs came here, in San Diego, where the hop load is in the opinions of most, entirely too much. Im working on that, and I think this beer is incredible. Balanced. Orange. Crisp. Perfect, no matter where you are in the US.","San Diego, California, USA","bindpmc"

The mouthfeel is smooth, theres great stickiness, and perfectly appropriate CO2 levels.  The taste is truly exceptional.  Everything in the aroma is here in the taste (though perhaps not the tangerine).  Theres big grapefruit and sticky piney hops over a rich and smooth malt backbone.

3853,"2006-06-26",3.6,"UPDATED: SEP 18, 2016 Bottle (Aug 30, 2016 bottling).

Head is initially average sized to large, frothy, white, mostly lasting.
Body is light amber.

Aroma is lightly to moderately malty (toasted grain, cookie), moderately hoppy (grapefruit, apricot, resin, orange), with a light note of dried mango.

Flavor is moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, lightly to moderately bitter.
Finish is lightly to moderately sweet, lightly to moderately acidic, moderately to heavily bitter.

Medium body, velvety texture, lively carbonation.

Probably the freshest bottle Ive had, and not surprisingly also the most resinous smelling bottle too. A few more months of age will likely help, given that its bottle conditioned...hopefully soften the flavor balance a bit, ease back on the resin, and bring out more ester nuances.","Boulder, Colorado, USA","Ernest"
3853,"2006-06-25",4.1,"Hazy golden color with a large white head.  Huge floral aroma with some nice pine notes.   Pine/citrus more noticeable in the flavor with a valiant attempt by the malt to add some balance.  Very flavorful and drinkable ale.","Oswego, Illinois, USA","TerryR"
3853,"2006-06-24",4.6,"UPDATED: NOV 10, 2006 The hops were so arromatic at first it reminded me, unfortunately, of some flowery air deoderant/bag but I quickly sensitized and now I crave the aroma. Fantastic dry balanced hop flavor if you are in the mood for smoothness. Once or twice ive had a bottle that seems a bit off, and I dont think its me-- apparently perfection  is hard to achieve 100% of the time.","Madison, Wisconsin, USA","chimpscampee"
3853,"2006-06-24",3.6,"UPDATED: AUG 21, 2006 Aroma is a kiss of sugar sour apple hops.  Looks a deep amber gold, small fine white tight hed with sponge cake bubbles.  Bitter, a little fruity, not too complex, a little over-bitter masking any potential flavor.  Slightly metallic palate.  Not to my taste for IPAs.
Re-rate: nice juicysweet citrus aroma.  Pilsnery pale gold with whitecap head.  Tastes like a big sweet orange with a mild , smooth, creamy hop finish.  Moderate-light alcohol presence.  Overall a better flavor, palate and experience than my first drink, but still not a top experience, a solid IPA without major flaws.","Paleolithic, Pennsylvania, USA","xproudfoot"

Great aroma that makes you want to throw it down immediately. Medium-bodied. Feels slightly sweet in the mouth. There are lots of hops that counteract those hops to make it a well-balanced one. Hoppyness is really mellow and the bitterness is without harsh notes. Finishes somewhat abruptly with a watery feeling. This is a great IPA. Batch 7355.","Oslo, NORWAY","Gr0ve"

And FINALLY I make it to Detroit for the Movement music fest and just so happen to come along to a place called Jacoby’s that had a Bells product. The previous night I was left high and dry when i got to the club too late and they already stopped serving...sooo I missed out on the stout. Anyhow. VERY FINE IPA. Complex yet subtle in every degree. From the hoppy malt nose to the hop-in-the-kitchen taste. Very refreshing and clean and well blended. Some tartiness here, some sweetness there. Each sip was different. Fruits to Grasses. TECHNO AND BEER!!  Because I miss this so much, it gets a 5.","Brooklyn, New York, USA","BeerBlockaid"

This is a really tasty, absolutely sessionable beer, but I have a hard time seeing it as an IPA.","Kirkland, Washington, USA","bitbucket"

Plenty of swirling sediment adds to its robust, flawless character.","Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA","CTippmann"

The aroma is reminiscent of hop perfume, absolutely perfect.  The appearance can be a little cloudy, just age in the fridge for a week and pour straight out with no gurgling.  The flavor just sings with American hops and a great malt backbone.  Bitterness is just right.  So well made and so well balanced, I dont know how they do it.  A definite must try.","USA","tnlandsailor"

Wonderfully hoppy aroma - sweet too, honey, with fresh orange citrus and some lemon - what a wonderful unique mix. Even some alcohol.  Taste has a huge hop wallop at first - very sharp and citrus like.  A little thin in the body which makes the hops even more prominent.  Dry bitter finish.  Very nice, just a tad one dimensional.","Ontario, CANADA","Gorbalev"

Theres malt in the aroma and flavour as well to balance things out but this is all about the hops. Creamy mouthfeel, medium bodied.

3853,"2006-02-12",4.0,"Bottle (12oz).  Poured hazy gold, plenty of bubbles, large solid lasting foamy beige head.  Sweet hoppy aroma - pine, grapefruit, apricot, pineapple and spruce, quite sharp - plus enough malt to make note of; there was a brief rush of yeast when I popped it.  The taste is really muted - fruit and citrus/evergreen hops dominate, but are quite restrained - it does finish long, and bitter, but never aggressive; the malt is lightly toasted and also just murmurs along too.  Mouthfeel is very creamy, lightly astringent, I felt it had solid body for an IPA.

Its very fresh and exotic with plenty of rather pleasing outdoorsy scents. Flavor is quite well balanced between the peppery hops and smooth sweet malts, though still packs a little bit of a punch with bitterness. This is an enjoyable beer for most occassions.

Man, this stuff is good on tap. The aroma is completely full of citrusy hops. Flavor is rich of lemon, pine, grapefruit. Malts are just present enough to attempt some kind of counteraction. Even just licking my lips after this one is bitter. Good, clean, rich IPA. Excellent.

Draught at Yacht Club: Pours a reddish color with a nice off-white head. Hops are all over the place on this. The bitterness cuts like a knife and adds a full citrus flavor.

Beneath the bright, sweet hop aroma is an equally pleasant slightly earthy sweet malt character.  With all of that delicious aroma, youd think the flavour couldnt match it, but it does.  Sweet pale malt with just a kiss of caramel and bready flavours topped with strong sweet piny and grapefruity hops.  Hops arent really unusual in their profile but the execution is impeccable.

I understand this could be a plus for some, especially if you drink it like a session beer, but I like my IPAs to attack the palate a little more.

3853,"2005-12-08",4.5,"UPDATED: JUN 28, 2010 Hand-pulled at Ashleys in Ann Arbor
Pours a hazy light amber with a reasonable head.
The nose is big candied grapefruit peel and spice; the flavor follows, again an almost sweet, fruity and heavily spice-like beer,. definite floral tones, a warming hint of alcohol, and of course with a long and deep bitter hop finish that leaves the mouth watering deliciously for more. It doesnt come with the devastating oily resin of many of the PacNW competitors, and for this beer, that works beautifully.

This is a first-rank IPA. Im sure Im tossing it an extra couple of points for the delight of coming on cask, but this was a wonderful beer-drinking experience. (Addendum: after a repeat on tap at Red Hawk, the 4.5 stands though admittedly it was probably a point shy on tap. In the bottle, its a different beer again, with less citrus and more malt coming through. Even there were looking at 4.2 to 4.3. Great beer.)
Further addendum March 09: cracked another bottle that someone sent me last night. I was starting to wonder if it really deserves the 4.5 I gave it. After tasting again, I think so. This is definitely 4.3 territory out of the bottle; it stands right up there with Pliny the Elder or Green Flash or any of the top IPAs, but its a more midwestern beast (is that a style?) better balanced and reminiscent of the delights at Town Hall.

Bottle again, 2/10/10. Every time I get back to Michigan and have the chance to drink another bottle, I wonder whether its really as good as I remembered. The answer is always yes. Amazing stuff, lovely fruity hop flavors. Id say I was too kind to Green Flash above; its more PtE ties with two-hearted, and Green Flash comes a decided third place.

Two Hearted Ale has fine balance all the way through.  In the aroma, the Centennial hops and sweet malt intertwine great.  The bitterness is kept in check with a good malt back bone.

3853,"2005-08-13",3.8,"UPDATED: FEB 10, 2006 One Ive had many times, this time in a bad from a bottle, poured into a glass.
Pale amber with a nice head.  One of the more ridiculously hoppy IPAs Ive run across.  Sometimes more piney, sometimes more floral.  The malts underneath are especially pleasant, sweet, and smooth, but they are overpowered a bit.  Not my favorite IPA, but close.
Rerate note!  If you can find Cask Aged Two Hearted (called Hand Pulled at the Berkley Front in Berkley, MIchigan) GET IT!  Its very different from the regular, smooth and aromatic in a way that far exceeds the regular!  I would rate it a 4.4 at least!","Royal Oak, Michigan, USA","sandwichpants"

Pours a hazy copper with a creamy ivory head. Lots of draping lace down the side of the glass. Smells of cirtusy hops and light fruity malt.

Taste is dominated by intense floral and citrusy hops. Theres some light pale malt crispness in there but this brew is all about the hops. And while the beer may be unbalanced the hops flavors are nicely balanced with each other. Bitter and sweet citrus intertwined. Long lingering bitter aftertaste and crisp.

3853,"2005-07-31",4.3,"UPDATED: MAY 8, 2009 Bottle for this rating, but I have had it at the brewery also. Two Hearted Ale pours a deep yellow( not quite orange) with a nice off-white head. I had forgotten how good the hop aroma is with this beer. It reminds me of smelling the hops in the package as I add them to homebrew. It has an excellent hop flavor, but isnt particularly bitter at first, BUT, it then finishes very dry. I love very hoppy beers, but this is just slightly thin in body. It is very good, but its thinness keeps it from being one of the truly elite American IPAs to me. Overall- very good!","Centerville, Ohio, USA","clingman71"

This is an excellent IPA, and has very intense aromas and flavors, but it lacks complexity.  First pop the cap, and youre ready for salad.  Very hoppy aroma.  The hops in the flavor are wonderfully balanced by a malty sweetness.  And, this balance is throughout the trip, across the tip of the tongue, as it lingers in your mouth, and finally as it hits the back of your throat, the hops and malt are there in equal amounts.  Where this one lacks is thats all there is.  Deep, but not wide.  Either way, its a good IPA.  Again, thanks to Ughsmash for a great trade!","Windsor, Connecticut, USA","SwedeDog"

3853,"2005-07-14",4.5,"A very nice pale orane color with the yeast adding a richer bronze color.  Head is pale in color and generous, very dense.  Aroma is characteristic of what I expect from this beer...huge perfumey, citrust, mixed fruit cup, Centenniel hop aroma.  The yeast aroma is subdued.  Solid bitterness, tasty orane hop/malt interaction, slight residual malt sweetness fights with the bitterness on the palate.  Body is med/full and is swept away slowly by the bitterness.  From start to finish the maltiness envelops the rest of the flavor characteristics.  The bitterness smacks at the initial sip and remains throughout the beer and creates a cleansing finish accentuated by perfumey, ethereal hoppiness.  The mid palate is dominated by the orangey malt/hop flavor interaction.  The layers of flavor and complexity are amazing and intense.  I could probably make this score a 5 if I rated this based upon the real ale version.","Kalamazoo, Michigan, USA","AlchemistZ"

It must be. Pours a deep-red-copper cum sunset red/brown with a hint of rainbow trout pink. Forms a tannish head, very soft. Taste is Centennial hops all over the place.

The flavor was very good.  Lots of pine and orange hops with sweet caramel malts.  Mmmm....  How a man could part with this is unknown.  Its SOOO good.","Glendale, Wisconsin, USA","1FastSTi"

smells of a big citrus and floral hops a touch of pepper as well.  Palate was dry and well coating medium body a little tart.  Flavor is a big grassy floral hop very piney and bitter.  Not one of my favroites its just to simple all crisp hop not much else.. I can detect a tiny malt in it but its just dominated by the hops.","Wisconsin, USA","MIBRomeo"

Excellent of floral, peppery and piney hops with caramel and a bitter finish, like with the aroma the pepper is the dominating element. The body is medium with an oily but mostly dry texture, the carbonation is soft. Its an excellent IPA but if the pepper would have been more subdued I would have enjoyed it even more.

3853,"2005-05-19",3.7,"Gorgeous orange/amber with a medium, soapy/frothy head; light lacing.  Big aroma of citrus, hops, heavy pine.  Flavor is good but not awesome: light malt and immediately a noticeable spiciness; heavy hops; excellent alcohol warmth (astounding for 6%, really).  Medium- to full-bodied but clean.  I dont usually care that much for IPAs because they are too over-hopped; somehow this beer manages to be very heavily hopped but not offensively so.  Certainly just about the best IPA Ive had to date, though not in my top 5% of beers overall.","Columbus, Ohio, USA","sfontain"

Strong floral hops and big citrus aroma, a lot of orange in this one.

3853,"2005-05-07",4.5,"After a bad experience with their Cherry Stout I had to try something else a little more redeeming. This poured out a slightly murky golden orange with a tall white rocky head. As the head shrank into the body scattered lacing was left to coat the glass. Very hoppy aroma with citric and floral hops coming out in abundance. There was a slight hint of malt to it at times. Taste was very similar very hoppy all the way through this one with citric and earthy flavors coming together for a great taste. A bitter hoppy aftertaste is how this ended. Mouthfeel was creamy with about a medium body. I could drink this all day, great flavor and aroma too bad I only picked up 2 bottles. Highly recommend to all hop heads and anyone that likes a good brew.","Sterling, Virginia, USA","meathookjones"

Some notes of grass and pine.   The flavor is much of the same with some malt background, citrus, hops and a hint of spice.  This is amazingly smooth and drinkable for an IPA.  It finishes quite crisp and delicious on the palate.  It manages to not get you with that harsh bitterness.  This is a great beer and will likely become my summertime goto this year on the deck.  Delicious!","Hilliard, Ohio, USA","OhioDad"

A beautiful bouquet of aromas with huge amounts of spring florals and citrus up front, with lesser notes of pine and earth, and light sweet caramel tones lurking just under the surface.  Taste was pretty close to the aroma with grapefruity hops blending harmoniously with the lightly sweetened malt backbone.  Medium bodied, soft carbonation, floral , citric, bittersweet finish.

This is a beer that I have drank a lot of in the last year. I guess Ill rate it now. 12oz bottle from the cellar (the one I had before was from the fridge). Served in my NB worthy glass @ 56°. Pours golden orange with a 1"" rocky white head. Lots of small bubbles. The aroma is floral and piney hops. Almost smells like KB. The flavor is honeyish at first then the piney hops kick in with their bitterness. The beer seems different after each sip; one time the piney hops are in control, then on the next sip the floral hops are in control, after that the citrus hops take charge . The hops are big, but kept in check by the wonderful honey malt. This is just a beautiful IPA. It is not so bitter as to make it (somewhat) difficult to drink, yet not so balanced that you yearn for the bitterness of the hops to go along with the hops aroma and taste.","Prairie Village, Kansas, USA","csbosox"

Sweet malt aromas are nearly hidden beneath giant floral and grapefruit hops.  Resinous flavors, quite dry front and middle, exciting hops.  But the malts struggle to keep up and even any residual sweetness is tainted by an attack of bitterness and back-of-the-palate astringency.  Lovely mouthfeel is soft, brisk, bubbly, yet full.  Very tasty in the vein of popular IPAs, but I think more backbone would go a long way in making this one a more substantial brew.  Thanks Willie!","Bel Air, Maryland, USA","willblake"

3853,"2005-03-20",4.9,"Great, multi-flavored IPA that leads my list of the regular IPAs. Outside of an Imperial IPA, this is hop heaven in my opinion. But this beer doesnt stop there as there is a lot going on. My first taste made me think of licorice, but after a few sips I started to differentiate the hops from the piney, citrus flavor and the diacetyl that does help this beer. On draught, the aroma is almost too perfumy and pungent (my bar neighbors always seem to notice the aroma when I have a glass of it), but the taste is incredible with a variety of distinct flavors screaming for attention. Out of the bottle, the aroma is more subdued and the taste a bit flatter, but still head and shoulders above the competition.

Aroma was mostly citrusy lemon hops, but not as much malt. Same with the flavor. It tastes like what I imagine hop candy would taste like. The hops were mostly a bright citrusy thing, but almost stale (but not old stale... maybe some underlying complexity that adds this flavor, like yeast perhaps). The sweetness is there to to make it palatable, but this is all about the hops. Quite a delicious elixir.","Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA","JCapriotti"

Taste of citrus fruits - predominantly of oranges - along with nice bittering agents and an in-your-face floral hop bouquet.

Aroma is floral and citruscy, hints of grapefruit and orange, but not too much so.  You can smell it from a good 4 feet away.  Makes my mouth water.  Taste is a little sweet at first but then you get hit with a big grapefruit hop flavor that stays with you for a while.  Hops tickle the palate.

Great head that actually climbs about one and a half inches out of the glass!  Head is white and laces decently as I go.  Nose is superb with sweet touches of pineapple, orange and tangerine along with a slight earthy aroma.  Taste is disappointing.  Sort of metallic and musty, not crisp or hoppy as I would expect.  Not much greatness here, and I wonder if my bottle is an old one... it is better than a lot of IPAs, but I expected this one to rival Hop Devil, Stoudts and Stone and this bottle is certainly not in their league.

3853,"2005-01-13",3.9,"One of my perrenial favorites.  A great goto beer that always satisfies.  Since bottling in the new plant, I have notice a better conistency (i.e. no infections) but a thinner body.  A decent trade off but surely it is lacking the thicker mouthfeel than I noticed a few years back.  Nice however and a definately one of the more consitent beers if you need a good hop thrashing.","Palos Heights, Illinois, USA","EddieG"
3853,"2005-01-13",5.0,"Magnificent head.  Orange color slightly cloudy.  The aroma is incredible.  Not sure if I smell flowers or grapefruit or both.  Just the right amount of malt and hops for me.

3853,"2004-12-09",4.5,"Quite possibly my favorite beer for general consumption.  Pours nice, nice big creamy head over a orange-gold hazy liquid.  Scents of grapefruit, juniper and hops match well with the first sip in which evergreen and hops flavors become more intense without overpowering maltiness.  Slight warmness due to alcohol content makes this a great in winter, while crisp flavoring is nice when its hot, too.  Top notch!","The Wet Side of a Dry Town, Pennsylvania, USA","MrBunn"
3853,"2004-12-06",3.7,"Pours with an orangey tint, hazy with hop sediment, and a lasting ecru head. Overwhelming grapefruit nose with honey and seawater in the background. Happily, the godnotanothercascadeipa aroma belies the fresh, crisp compexity of flavors that follow: butterscotch malt, lemon zest, inviting fruitiness, and gingery peppery spice. Mellow earthy bitter aftertaste with impressions of lemon pepper. Saison-like. Somewhat oily palate is perfectly tempered by prickly carbonation.","New Mexico, USA","maltdog"
3853,"2004-12-05",4.1,"Pours orange with a big white head that lasts awhile. Big grapefruit aroma. Well balanced malt/hop flavor with a medium hops finish. Could be a little hoppier but really enjoyed anyway. Could drink this at almost any time. Well done.","Lincoln Park, Michigan, USA","Styles"

3853,"2004-12-01",3.6,"(12 oz bottle, obtained in trades with Goblincat and hopsrus, thanks Mike and John!) The nose is lightly malty, but fairly bready, slightly sour and mildy hoppy.  But I think the flavor is a bit of a let down after smelling the inviting aroma.  This is a pretty light flavored IPA, enjoyable, delicate, but not a big IPA.  A light, sweet, bready maltiness leads the way, with some fruitiness and moderately bitter hops for good balance.  The claim of ""enormous hop additions"" seems a bit self inflated if you ask me.  Medium bodied.  Not exactly clean and crisp because the level of hops isnt all that big.  Golden orange color and fairly cloudy.  Pours a large, whitish head that is very bubble -- large bubbles, in fact -- and forms craters as it falls away.  Dense, intricate lacing is left on the glass.","La Jolla, California, USA","DarkElf"
3853,"2004-11-30",3.9,"Very Pleasant and sharp hops.  Grapefruit, raw flower and lite grain/grass.  Nice medium gold/brown color with a small and lasting head (the last part was surprising to me).  The flavor was similar to the aroma at the begining with grapfruit hopw and other citrus straight away.  There are some lite malts that help with balance but his is a hopy ale all around.  Good.","Mansfield, Ohio, USA","brentfeesh"

Hazy orange-tan with off-white, dense, lasting finger of head that sticks to the glass and excellent, fine-bubbled carbonation. Fruity and hoppy up front with pine-orange hop flavour and intense bitterness. Feels very clean in the mouth.

3853,"2004-11-18",4.6,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2008 Current rating: cask @ Beer Engine, 3/08
One of the best IPAs Ive ever had.  Miles beyond this in bottle or draught (and I had a pint on draught the night before having this cask version.) Layers or malt & hop not even hinted at in those other serving formats.  Copper tan head with nice lacing.  Nose is.... no.  This goes beyond my usual ""nose is...  flavor is... comment on the body"" format.  This is stunning.  Damn close to perfection.  This is one of those pints that Ill tell stories about for years to come, like the Storm King I had on cask at the Victory Brewpub years ago when Storm King was at the top of its game.  This is what Peter Bouckart (sp?) of New Belgium is talking about when he says that brewers are creating art that gives people ""10 minutes of pleasure.""

Do you remember the first time you found you loved IPAs?  That definitive moment where it all clicked?  For me it was Hop Devil.  It was just this absolutely amazing thing that I had never experienced before.  This perfect, logical expression of happiness in flavor form.  This beer is that, all over again, even after my taste buds have been jaded by 92 other IPAs and 54 double IPAs.  This is an epiphany.

The only problem with this beer is that I cant share it with my friends.  Someday.  

But for now, just fucking wow.

Sampled from a typical 12 oz brown bottle this fine beer poured a rich golden color with a medium sized yellow-white head. Very pretty. A strong grapefruit, pine  and sweet sugary scent fairly explodes from the glass as one can smell this one before the glass is even taken in hand. The front taste is sweet and pear like with a thick mouthfeel. Then on comes full bore hops. Strong elements of grapefruit that become dominant and linger forever on the aftertaste. Really a very fine IPA.","GREENSBURG, Pennsylvania, USA","FROTHINGSLOSH"

Everything is here, bananas, citrus (lemon, grapefruit most prevelant), hops and possibly some spice.  If I give it some thought Im sure I might find something else in the aroma.  The beer is a nice balance of citrus flavors, mostly grapefruit.  With a genuine hop finish.  Quite enjoyable.","Seattle, Washington, USA","leitrim65"

The aroma is fresh hops with pine resin and hay.  The taste is that of pine resin and pepper like hop heat tempered with the flavors of mandarin orange, caramel malt, and the gritty, earthy yeast.  The beer is creamy smooth like a stick of butter melting on your tongue.

Very typical light amber colored with a nice thick head.

Cant seem to smell any malts at all.  Oh well.  The taste is pretty underwhelming.  Its quite bitter and quite tangy, but aside from a mellow malt body around mid tongue, there really isnt much to taste.  Goes down clean and has a pleasent aftertaste tho.

3853,"2004-05-02",4.6,"For a style with a lot of competition, this beer truly stands out. It pours a nice, thick head with _layered_ lacing that lasts to the end of the glass. The initial aroma is strongly rosy with a little hop perkiness. The beer is well carbonated and bubbles out quite nicely on the palate. As its sipped, a unique yet simple maltiness affirms itself, and the floral aromas blend together with citrus tangs and well-pronounced hops and some hard-to-describe nutmeg-like spice elements. In my opinion, the problem with a lot of IPAs (including most of the big ones) is that they simply dont use enough hops to balance the malts and allow the nuances to show through. However, this brew is bold enough to virtually make that statement in its commercial description. The result of this well-balanced brew is that the aftertaste immediately shows the same strong rose aroma as the initial impression -- yet after half a minute or so it evolves into a refreshing lemon, and a couple minutes more its the typical, generic malt/hop aftertaste, sort of like trainmen on a caboose waving to kids on a bridge - to me, this progression is the highlight of drinking Two Hearted Ale!

3853,"2004-04-26",3.8,"UPDATED: DEC 18, 2005 So in my glass is the famous Two Hearted IPA. It looks good, potent dark sun yellow, lightly hazy, with a great very foamy and rocky white head, highly carbonated in appearance. Acute citrusy C-hops nose, very flowery, sweet, sour, hints at lemon pie, lilac (orval anyone?), grapefruit, grass. Solid toasty/cookie malt attack early like a good pils, quickly complemented by the direct floral and citrusy hops. Great flavor development for an IPA, but you know where theyre from, hopheads neck of the wood and always lacking a touch of ""multidimensionality"". Tremendous velvety texture, less carbonated than anticipated. Clean and long oily bitter finish. Quite good, but top 100 in the world? I think not. Maybe a top 10 IPA though.

3853,"2004-03-04",4.0,"12oz bottle. I smelled the green leafy hops before the first drip hit my glass.  A very crisp, green hop aroma, lots of sweet citrus.  Nice pale gold color, clear, with a big cotton like head that never went away.  The mouthfeel was the best, very soft, good body.  The overall flavor was good, but not great (for me).  There was a bitter hop finish, but not any real hop BANG that I was expecting.  Certainly not over the top.  Very drinkable and enjoyable.","Cleveland, Ohio, USA","dperk"

3853,"2004-02-05",3.7,"UPDATED: FEB 6, 2004 Pours an amber color, quite clear except for a few large floaties.  Forms a thin beige head that does not stick around too long.  An immediate aroma of American hops wafts from my glass.  Notes of lychee, grapefruit & other citrus fruits are in the nose, it smells slightly sweet & nectar like, there is a hint of caramel malt here as well.  Ooh, quite bitter; this beer finishes with a drying intense bitterness.  Overall this beer is only slightly sweet, it has a light body & is focused entirely on the hop component.  The hops are over the top, but perhaps it is missing some hop flavor.  There is lots of bitterness, but it feels like it is missing some balancing hop nectar flavor.  Underlying the hop attack there seems to be some nuttiness, as well as some caramel notes.  This beer is all about the hop attack, not much malt here, so if you don't like hops stay away.  Luckily I do like hops so this beer is just fine.  Perhaps a bit too unbalanced for an everyday drinking beer, but every once in a while is nice.","Tucson, Arizona, USA","FlacoAlto"

Pours a muddy golden caramel color with an excellent rocky, off-white head and pretty good lacing.  Looks like an awesome IPA.  Aroma does not disappoint.  Very fragrant, floral hops and chewy citrus (grapefruit and lemon) and nectar notes, with a hint of pine.  Extremely compelling.  Flavor jumps right out of the glass at you-- bitter hay and grassy hop elements, still a bit of citrus, and now lots of resin, all with an overwhelming smooth malt backbone.  A faint hint of sourness with the citrus.  Very active in the mouth with carbonation, hops, and a bit of drying harshness from the resin notes.  Smooth medium body with long-lasting finish of pale malt and muted hops, a little bit dusty.

Warm, glowing, light peach with perfect clarity.  Huge, puffy off-white head that fades here and there, leaving huge, cloud-like pillows of foam.  Tons of sticky lace.  Enormously aromatic nose with a huge blast of floral Centennial hops, with soft pink grapefruit, and hints of orange, peach, and mango.  Underneath is a thin foundation of toasted malt and slightly chalky yeast.  Flavor is an eruption of hop flavor and velvet hammer-like bitterness.  Flowers, pink grapefruit, peaches, oranges, mangosits all there in an incredibly soft and sticky delivery.  The malt and yeast manage to stay afloat enough to provide a solid base for the hop explosion happening above.  Medium in body, with a soft and round mouthfeel that only gets better with the yeast pour towards the bottom.  Finishes dry, firm, and bitter, with a splash of citrus and black pepper.  Through my many years of better beer, this is still my favorite expression of the IPA style, and one of only a few beers that I cannot drink only one of.  My opening of a bottle of this guarantees a second and third.  Its worth noting that since the new brewery opened in Comstock, this beers flavor profile has been much cleaner, with much less sediment.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","MarkR"

The hand pull yielded a beer with no bubbles, yet a firm mouthfeel. The IPA hops were actually subdued, nicely balanced between floral and bitter. Somehow I picked up a note of cherries, too. Color is lighter than the usual American IPA, closer to a Vienna or even a Pilsner. I had hoped to get a better impression of Bells than I did at their Eccentric Cafe taproom, and I was right.Bottled, May 22, 05. A slightly different experience from a chilled bottle, and no less fascinating. Unfiltered like the other bottled Bells, with quite a lot of bits floating around, that dont detract in the least from the enjoyment. I may have waited a bit too long to open this bottle I got in November, as the floral hops I noted on draft are a little rougher, more piney and northwestern.

3853,"2003-10-23",4.2,"UPDATED: MAR 27, 2008 Bottle pours a nice golden color with a beautiful head that sustains and leaves lots of lace.  The aroma is flowery hops and grapefruit.  The flavor is rooted in malt but is fully challenged with hops, resulting in a fine IPA.  The palate is rich and coats the mouth.  Overall, this is very nice and will seek it out in the future.  Update 3/27/2008 - I brought home a fresh 6 pack of this as Ive not had any in over three years.  It is still freeking good.  I somehow thought it was a go to session beer, but forgot the 7% ABV.  As a result, I am pretty intoxicated, but safe at home in front of my laptop.  Cheers.","Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA","Syd"
3853,"2003-10-21",4.1,"UPDATED: MAR 20, 2004 Very light copper appearance, nice creamy white head that kept a veneer the entire time.  Aroma was a pleasant burst of pink grapefruit dominated hops.  The flavor was similarly dominated by sour grapefruit, with a hint of earthiness breaking through as it warmed.  Bitter, dry finish.  Good, but a bit thin on the finish, needed just a bit of a stronger malt kick for me.  Thanks, Indra.  Note:  Sampled on tap on a business trip, almost identical profile, just not quite as creamy.","Glen Allen, Virginia, USA","Kinz"

It was good, but didn't kill me.  Well, IT'S BAAAAACK!  Beautiful, bright yellow with a thick, thick stiff white head.  Hop aroma exploding at you.  Creamy mouthfeel.

3853,"2003-10-15",4.4,"UPDATED: APR 1, 2004 Poured a faintly hazy orange/gold color with a moderate head and good lacing. Assertive hoppy aroma with orange, grapefruit and floral notes. Medium bodied and fresh tasting, almost raw at first, bitter and citrusy, but though the hops prevail here, there is a delicious underlying malty smoothness that makes everything alright. Lingering bittersweet finish. Whoa baby, what an ale!","Rhineland, Missouri, USA","Jedsbrew"

Taste is bitter and then sweet. I liked this IPA for its high level of biiterness, flowery aroma and drinkability.  Some IPAs are just too darn strong (see Dogfish Head), but this one is just right.","Mount Pleasant, Wisconsin, USA","kmeves"
3853,"2003-10-12",4.5,"2003: Clear golden hue with a creamy white head and very good lace. The aroma is piney and grapefruity hops with a touch of toasted malt and twangy yeast, very floral. Citrus and bitterness is at the forefront with nice undertone of sweetness. Dry and moderate bitter finish, very smooth for something with such a hop character. Another lovely brew from Bells. Highly recommended.","La Porte, Indiana, USA","BBB63"
3853,"2003-09-30",4.8,"Pours with a voluminous cream colored head atop a hazy orange beer with amber highlights. The head slowly recedes while it leaves a thick, sticky lace on the glass. The aroma is very sweet bubble gum with a strong lemon-pine hop presence. The sweetness is evident on the pour, and as you carry the glass to your seat. I wanted to take a drink immediately! Who needs notes anyway, right? The first drink is truly heavenly, with a great malt sweetness sparked by a terrific hop bite. What a dichotomy of tastes that somehow blend together perfectly! Very strong citrus notes are prevalent in subsequent quaffs, but the malt is never forgotten. The finish is exceptionally smooth and clean for such a flavorful beer. All that is left is a hint of fruitiness and a hint of bitterness. The mouthfeel is very rich and supple, while not becoming too heavy as the beer is finished.","McMurray, Pennsylvania, USA","aaronh"
3853,"2003-09-27",3.7,"Pours a light amber, with a small head and some light lacing. Medium carbonation. Aroma flowery, slightly citrusy with a slight sweet malt hint. Taste sweet, hoppy, malty, hoppy again, sweet again then slightly bitter, in that order. Not as bitter finish as I like, and also a little thin in the mouth feel for my IPA tastes (but I fear I may be jaded by the bigger, imperial IPA style), but nonetheless a very drinkable ale. The mouth feel is perhaps not thin, just different.","Cleveland, USA","Ubiquibeer"
3853,"2003-09-24",4.4,"UPDATED: MAY 14, 2005 re-rating the cask version.  holy crap this is good.  flat and the proper temperature makes this beer even better.  the aromas are there but more subtler and more nuanced, and it has less of an overt bite, instead it softly becomes nice and bitter and perfectly balanced. wow.
original rating from bottle:  hops and citrusy malt dominate the aroma.  its light amber, semiclear, with just a little bit of head and not much lacing.  this is a full-blown IPA, with TONS of hops in the mouthfeel and finish.  you can definitely detect the dry-hopped centennials.  its all hops and its all good, with this one from bells.","farmington, Michigan, USA","jtw"

I'm glad I bought this beer. It's a bit sour and has a thick citrus taste. Maybe not a session beer, but I think I'm going to knock down the other 5 in the fridge tonight anyway.

3853,"2003-07-29",3.8,"Aroma is of slightly herbal European hops with a hint of leather. It is an unfiltered auburn color with white head and smooth lacing. An extremely light body for so much hops and alcohol. Dry, bitter, and almost watered down on the palate which makes this very refreshing and would be exceptional with some spicy food. Overall this is a good IPA with lots of hops and a great unique mouth feel for some hidden complexities. Thanks Indra!","McCall, Idaho, USA","BückDich"
3853,"2003-07-28",4.0,"This was an extyremely tasty first beer of the evening.  Mild aroma, with largely hoppy scents emenating from the bottle upon opening.  Beautiful frothy head, that looks extremely cloudy and unfiltered.  The taste overwhelms your tongue with flavor, medium bodied and extremely hoppy, but not as much as I expected.  Very well balanced, and clean and easy to drink.  I could easily drink several of these just because of the lightness in the mouth.
Clean and crisp in the finish with a slight bit of bitter sweetness.","Tacoma, Washington, USA","harlequinn"

Have enjoyed each one more than the last - surely deserves to be rated as my highest IPA - up a notch or two. Aroma and flavor more intense yet so overwhelmingly well balanced. Original 4.1 Bottle overflowed upon opening - which led to a thick sticky white head. Orangeish hazy appearance. Very pleasing fresh citrusy aroma. Very thick mouthfeel - can almost chew it. Bittersweet citrusy flavor. Strong finish and also a lot of sediment remaining on the bottom of the glass. Overall, an excellent IPA from Bells - have not had a bad one yet from them.","Tallahassee, Florida, USA","PorterPounder"

An interesting brew and a great job by the folks @ Kalamazoo.","Orange, California, USA","Blake"
3853,"2003-06-24",4.7,"Color was a solid goldish yellow, small bubbly head that faded fast but left nice tight lace in patches around the glass. Aroma is very grapefruit/orangey/lemony peel-like with lots of fresh floral hops and a bit of spice. Straight up taste is very fresh hops, citrusy with some spice notes and grain, nothing overbearing, very mellow, its perfectly balanced and is very crisp and clean with a great, light dry finish.

3853,"2003-06-03",3.6,"UPDATED: MAR 22, 2005 2002 bottle. Dark Brownish Red ale.  This was interesting. For some reason I didnt care for the mixture of hops in this one.  Needs something more. If ever there was a case of a too-hoppy-IPA this might be it.  Though, I dont mind Sierra Nevadas PA or Ipswichs Ipa. I suppose I shall have to buy this beer and review it.Rerate.  Not much changed from first impression.  The heavy hops flavor, with the additional dry hopping creates a tough act to balance, and the pale crystal malt does not get the job done.  Sure, it tastes wonderfully of hops and is fresh and clean, but there just is not enough good malt flavoring.  Points for a good yeasty flavor though, dont get that often in IPAs.  Aroma is very dry, some yeast, some earthy hops. 2003 FRESH bottle. Ok, well it looks like I got my first case of bells gone bad in the previous ratings.  Guess those 2002 bottles had sat out too long.  These new bottles were much better. Gone is the astringent, stale taste.  Much better balance than I remember, but there is a weird alcohol flavor in the body that is quite prevalent on the finish.  Not pleasant at all. I just dont seem to get along with this beer.","Boston, Massachusetts, USA","ClarkVV"

Aroma is superb, piney and citrusy. Has it's own uniqueness to it and different from other great IPA's. I smell a little cedar as another reviewer points out. Nice lacing. Very crisp and carbonation is solid. I only wish I could buy these locally. Would be a regular for me.","Cape Coral Waterfront Wonderland, Florida, USA","BierBauch"
3853,"2003-05-24",3.7,"UPDATED: DEC 31, 2014 (Had several more times over the years - its a dang good IPA, but there are plenty of better ones out there) Cloudy golden color, high carbonation, small but creamy head - citrus and hops in the aroma in abundance - flavor is very woody, with heaping helpings of various hop varieties that coat the tongue much in the way malts would do in a sweeter beer (its an odd sensation, but enjoyable) - great hop finish, not overly bitter, with some hints of cedar - this is an excellent IPA","Denver, Colorado, USA","notalush"
3853,"2003-05-24",3.5,"UPDATED: MAY 28, 2004 Strong cedary, piney, grapefruity, citrusy nose, no doubt due to the hops. Smooth sweetish maltyness. Sharp bitterness at the end, with some saltyness and some alcohol noticed, lingering bitterness. Grapefruity and a bit woody?. I don't know, to me this wasn't very exciting, a bit one dimensional, even though it had quite a lot of flavour, i found it pretty easy to pick apart. Still, quite alright.

A nice enjoyable beer! 4/27/03: Very hoppy aroma, but on the dry side. Large, foamy, off-white head; somewhat rocky. Amber, hazy color. Decent lace.

Enormous head that lasts until the end.  Initial blast is a bitter/winey flavor with fruity notes.  The hops, though prevalent, are rather subdued.  As the beer warms the flavor really devolops and the hops come alive.  Very smooth finish.  A nice overall ale, and a unique offering.  Sort of an American strong ale.","Rochester, New York, USA","JahNoth"

The beer pours with a nice finely laced head. the aroma is citrus, very reminiscent of some of the better Belgian's. It's strongly hopped an has a long fruitey palate. I have had it both in the bottle and on tap. The draught beer has more fruity nose and is in my opinion better than the bottled presentation. A keeper.","Alabama, USA","vtmobile"

Strong aroma of hops with touches of orange, grapefruit, and lemon that reminds me of of the way lemon poundcake with icing smells.

3853,"2003-01-27",4.0,"Clear golden color with a thick, white merangue head that lasts and leaves a healthy lacing on the glass. Super hop aroma - sweet, piney, resin and grapefruit. The flavor is a blast of hops. Hoppy, sweeet, and a hint of Pez candy! The hops in this beer add a lot of bitterness. Subdued malt flavor. Lasting hop aftertaste. Heavy carbonation and a moderate, resiny mouthfeel. Quite enjoyable.","San Diego, California, USA","rodolito"
3853,"2003-01-25",4.4,"UPDATED: OCT 3, 2003 Re-rate.  I dont know what happened the first time I tasted this but it is very different, perhaps the keg was bad.  This is wonderful on all senses.  A smooth orange color with a medium creamy white head.  Aroma is a mix of fruits, it is hard to pick out but peaches come to the front.  Silky smooth feel.  Taste is fruity, not very bitter, English like.  I need to get more.","Ohio, USA","redlem"

Makes a wonderful sweet first impression with a nice hoppy zing at the end.  A nice break from the overly-hopped IPAs that one usually gets.  The subtlety of Two Hearted on tap almost reminded me of a bitter, except that it had a bit more of a head.  Does that make any sense?

Re-rate: Had this in a fresh bottle and boy did it make a difference! Explosions of fresh fruit and flower hops.  So nuanced, soft and sweet.  This is the least abrasive, most delicate IPA I've had.  Maybe that's why it doesn't stay so long in the bottle (based on my other samples).  Find it fresh on tap or check the date on the box and you will not be sorry.","Mt Kisco, New York, USA","Brewso"

Nonetheless, it is a refreshing beer that I hope to consume a few more times this summer.

Decent, very bitter IPA; the hops are evident from the first spicy whiff, through the strongly bitter body and the long harsh finish.

Light copper-colored with a rich, thick head.  Hazy in appearance with a few floaties in there.  The aroma...oh the aroma.  Smells like fresh hops in the christmas tree.  Very full mouthfeel with that hop aroma taste, but little bitterness.

Hazy, deep golden hue with a large, rocky white head. Mostly, but not fully diminishing with great lacing.
The flavor is that of bitter juniper berries and pine/fir with just a suggestion of the heavy malt and high gravity alcohol.
Full-bodied with soft carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel.

The alcohol is not well disguised; it rears up and gallups right out your nose in a hurry.

Think of apricot jam smeared over a pine cone, and doused with Grand Marnier.","Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA","grant"

If you are a fan of contennial hops(grapefruit, citrus,etc) this is the IPA for you.  A pleasant blend of hops and malt, low enough in alcohol that you dont have to be real careful with the number you consume, its one that I can enjoy a sixer of and not take leave of my senses.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","JCW"

Indeed, for hop character, I think this is more intense than Victory, Alpha King, and even perhaps Stone IPA.  But I find it impossible to denigrate this beer.  Upon opening the bottle, the raw hop fragrance stunned me.  The hop flavor provided a wonderful citric vibrance throughout the bottle, twisting and turning and showing new flavor features.

Flavors are of grapefruit sweetened with sugar.  The sweet, medium to full malt body balances the huge hop presence perfectly.  Fantastic.

World class IPA-thanks to Bunkypop for hooking me up with this one!
ReRate-11/23/02 on tap at Old Chicago-Rockford, IL-The bottles that i had of this months ago must have been skunked.  On Tap, this is world class.  This is one of the more malty ipa's out there, but is very well balanced, moreso than SN celebration.  I tested the two head to head.  I still like the SN celebration more, but this runs right on its heals.
Old Rating-
Not as good as i was wanting it to be.  the start is great IPA hop, but the middle is kind of wierd, hard to describe.  This kind of got to me.  High alcohol presence, being at 7%.

Everyone in the bottle has been playing nicely: the hops have contributed their resin and hints of pine, and the malts have mustered up a great does of chewy caramel, peanut butter, and hints of raisins.  Though the aroma has developed extraordinarily, the palate is totally dead and the flavours are well on their way: thin and watery with a stale bitterness and no real hop presence (not unexpected, but a fun experiment).  My advice: stick with a fresh example (less than a year old), it is still one of my most favourite beers.","St. Louis, Missouri, USA","iwantalambic"

3853,"2002-08-12",4.1,"This was very enjoyable.  Nice citrus in the nose.  Aroma reminded me more of an APA than what I think of in an IPA.  More mellow and malty in the body than an APA.  Nice bitterness.  Citrus again in the mouth, but also some doughy/bread flavor as well.  Very enjoyable.  Another fine product from Bells.","Chicago, Illinois, USA","Jokes"

3853,"2002-07-01",4.0,"Comments added 7/1/02: Not as big and bold as the Stone or Victory Hop Devil; actually somewhat mild for an IPA.  Lots of floral and citrus character in this one.  Original comments: First off: this is some niiiice stuff.  Mighty drinkable and pleasant.  Let it warm up a little from fridge temperature and you get the full ride.  Okay, for an IPA, its a bit unusual: fairly standard orange color, cloudy, good head, nice retention, hoppy aroma.  But get this one into your mouth and you get a sweet, smooth character to it that I didnt get with the Victory Hop Devil or Stones IPA.  Dont know what it is that gives it the sweetness and smoothness, but I quite like it.  Still plenty of hop bitterness to make this an IPA worth its style designation.  Well-balanced and yummy!","Oregon, USA","cathcacr"

Its a big big beer, gentlemen. Still, lingering, there is a soft sweetness, not just citrus, but more flowery. And the trademark (IMO) biscuit, baked quality of the malts is truly evident. A great one. Rerate was 3.3 on 4/22/02: A year of lots of drinking and 6 months on ratebeer have finally matured my IPA sensibilities, and I can see this brew as the monster that is is. Pound all in: big hops, huge malt, thick and big. I see that now. Original: 12/01/01: My friends love this beer. It comes so highly recommended around here.

A hazy yellow with a well retained foam that would make any brewer envious.  Its still quite ""chewy"" and the presence of Tang finds its way into the profile.  Malt heartily keeps this hop bomb balanced.  This is a well crafted, consitent  offering from one of the midwests great breweries.** 5/4/2009:  Chewy does not even begin to describe this meal. It was a nice change, but I do not think I really want my IPAa to be as thick as a barleywine.  Great hop bite to it that is evenly matched by the malts.  Overall a nice beer.","Kansas City, Missouri, USA","MOboy"

Not suprisingly (at 7% alcohol), it is a dab light bodied.  Very, very good take on India Pale Ale.  One complaint:  Why is this seasonal??

3853,"2002-04-24",3.5,"UPDATED: JUN 14, 2016 Rich straw-hued body. Fluffy and sticky, stark white foam. Divine aroma of bubblegum and fresh-picked Centennial. Subtle nutty yeast and flower petals. Fluffy and creamy on the palate. Bottle-conditioned. Elegantly understated, softly citric hop flavors underlain with gobs of soft, yeast esters. Crisp pale malts balance the softly floral hops in the dry finish. Hop burps continue to rekindle the flavor with abundant notes of flowers and citrus. Solid. 

Re rate:  Metallic aroma and flavor lowers my rating from last years sample - Notes of bubble gum from the yeast and a sticky head.  Wonderful hop sack aroma.  A hop heads satisfaction, thats for sure.  Great mouth feel due to the bottle conditioning.","Blue Ridge Mountains, North Carolina, USA","TAR"

3853,"2002-02-20",4.3,"Begins with an explosion of hops in the nose, and in the cataclysmic head.  The head subsides into spectacular lacing and the first rocky cascadified sip into smoother, softer, but still aggressive flavours as the decent malt catches up to the hops.

3853,"2002-01-17",4.4,"UPDATED: DEC 23, 2003 Update:  2003-04 versions sampled in Oct, Nov '03 were firm in character but bland and totally lacking in the Two Hearted ""brightness.""  Dec '03 versions sampled so far are much better and are beginning to approach the fantastic 2001-02 versions.  The rocky, white lace left after an exhuberent pour is starting to come back.  The awesome smell is evident after cracking the bottle, but still not quite as strong in the glass.  I have only one question... who is the idiot that keeps this from being a year round brew?  

.............................................. Prior Review: I was pleasantly surprised when I opened a bottle of this very plainly marked beer.  It has a huge aroma and is somewhat overwhelming at first.  Things settle down quickly though as the brew reveals itself to be one of the top IPA's around.  It's a unique and well thought out beer.  Consider yourself lucky if you actually find a six pack on the shelf.  The 2001-02 version definitely had more personality than the 2002-03 version.  I hope it's simply a case of Bell's notorious quality contol and not a fundamental ""blanding-out"" of the recipe.","Alabama, USA","roacheater"
3853,"2002-01-17",4.0,"Pale orange color; Holy Moly, the head started to come out of the bottle before I could pour- stayed frothy and rocky (extra points in overall for this); tell-tale citrus and spice.

3853,"2002-01-06",4.1,"the label is weak and nebulous-- if i may hazard an opinion of the books cover.  the prose within however -- that is, the content--is a mark twain of ales.  the color is about pantone 1225, pale orange, too cloudy to read a neon billboard through.  a swirl of the glass encourages a galaxy of diminutive bubbles. the aroma is clean northwoods pine, those centennial hops embrace you like a golden retriever.  this is a pricey beer in my part of the world, but theres enough stuff floating in this one beer to brew a keg of budweiser.  tres yummy.","dolores, Colorado, USA","krisbierjaeger"
3853,"2001-12-30",4.1,"I have never come across a beer that had such a powerful hop aroma before.  I smelled it the instant that I opened the bottle.  Head was huge (I poured it too fast and lost some of the beer to my kitchen counter in fact).  Cloudy orange color.  The taste was about as expected - very powerful hop flavor, but oddly not as overpowering as Id expected.  The solid malt base prevents that.  I kind of wish tha I could get more of this, but you cant get it in these parts.  Thanks Proc!","Portland, Maine, USA","Sammys"

The nose is dominated by the hop floral crispness; sweet malt underlies this olfactory delight.
