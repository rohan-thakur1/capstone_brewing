2508,"2014-08-02",4.0,"After the Double Black, the other extreme in this remarkable series of experiments. Basically a table stout, but a very complex one, with thick, beige head and equally black colour. Aroma of cold coffee, ashes, charcoal, dates, chocolate, burnt grains, liquorice. Light but oily and velvety mouthfeel, very rich and strong taste and remarkable amount of body in comparison with the low strength (though inevitably a lot thinner than the other Black Damnations), malty, increasing roasted bitterness towards the end, long finish.","BELGIUM","Alengrin"

Taste: very watery start, chocolate finish, but rather watery. But still a very strong aftertaste, especially for its alcohol!

so.. this tastes watery. you know, for a black damnation. but knowing that this is 2 percent makes me have even more respect for them than i already had. yeah its wattery, but in a way you would say a 6-8 beer would be compared to the 13 percenters the damnations are.
it aslo has the taste of a 6 - 8 percenter. what should you imagine ? a black albert with some watter added, and the right amount of CO2. btw, for a 2 percenter, this is still pretty black ! you would definetley think its more than 2 ! would i drink it again, having the other damnations? definetley ! its a nice break between the high alcohols, tastes way better than any lager on the market ( tastes even heavier to ! ) cant wait for this to be bottled !","Antwerp, BELGIUM","kraddel"

Taste: Sweet malts and caramel, followed by a short touch of coffee bitterness. Very light and easy to drink. Hard to imagine this is only 2%.
Mouthfeel: Medium-low carbonation, thin mouthfeel.

2508,"2012-05-13",3.2,"This is the ice water after the eisbocking process for some of the Struise mega stouts like Special Kay and Messy. Eventually the alcohol gets so concentrated that the ice water has small amounts of alcohol in it as well and at this point the eisbocking process on pressure is about to max out. Since its under pressure, it is still carbonated. Pouring at CBC. I poured about 150 glasses of the single black for participants. This is a nice palate cleanser: bitter and roasty with no body. Not really hoppy either so no palate wrecking. The pour is still black and darker than a lot of craft ""stouts"". Head is thick and creamy and has mega retention when poured correctly. Jose is soft- small olive and roast. Taste is very thin as expected with bitter roast and cold light coffee. A bit gritty. Pretty funny concept and much appreciated over another mega stout. A little secret: a nice blend the Struise crew discovered was 1/3 Messy 2/3 Single Black. Adds body to the Single Black and cuts through the mega oil and sugar of the Messy. Good stuff.

Verse un beau brune foncé allant sur une note obsidienne col est épais brune/moka.
Arôme est malté grillé avec une touche de malt presque fumé, poudre de cacao et aspect cuivre. Intéressant car le bouquet est absolument identique à ses surs de la série le tout sur une profile chocolaté épais qui reste ne suspend.
En bouche, très léger, se boit avec plaisir et même à 2% se déguste tranquillement. Je note bien le profile majestueux du double black qui reste présent, le tout pour un profile léger de grains que je trouve être plus présent voire  poudreux, malt grillé et caramel et une pointe de fruits noirs. Le tout conserve ce chocolat épais. Fini est sec.","Enghien, BELGIUM","sebletitje"
