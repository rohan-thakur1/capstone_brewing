685,"2017-04-08",3.5,"Very sweet aroma with some peat, bourbon barrel and vanilla. Nice dark brown color with a ring of tan foam.

685,"2014-06-29",3.9,"12 oz. bottle via Texas trade - thanks again, Brian! Pours a deep, clear brownish-amber with a small beige head. Looks a lot like BB#4, actually. Aroma of peat, oak, brown sugar, toffee, and caramel. Flavor of peat, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, dates, and cookie. Medium-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a sticky, peaty mouthfeel. Good barrel-aged Scotch ale. Really grew on me over the course of drinking it.","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","phaleslu"
685,"2014-06-16",3.7,"12oz bottle, thanks to phaleslu for sharing. Peter thinks its from October 2013. Hazy dark brown color. Thin off-white head, leaves loose lace. Nice dark fruit, caramel, spice, bourbon aromas. Light smoke, peat, earthy hop, wood. Moderate bitter, more dry finish. Minimal sweet. Drinks like maybe 10%? Some warmth, but alcohol is not bothersome. Medium to bigger body. A little thinner than expected again, but it doesnt bother me as much as it did in the weizenbock I just tasted (bishop #4). A lot more of a bigger flavor on this one. A little more heat, too, but I like the edge. A little bit of pumpkin type spice to this, maybe? Good, enjoyable, flavorful way to do a scotch ale. Like the weizenbock, the texture could use a little work, but the flavor is awesome. Enjoyed the last half of my glass with some of foppas gouda... goddamn it kicked it up so many notches. Left my scores unchanged, though (cheese is unfair help)","Cincinnati, Ohio, USA","DrSilverworm"
685,"2014-04-25",3.8,"Got some of this from Cloaker and Errl-cheers to you both! Cloudy brown. Rich bourbon nose, vanilla, oak, and malty, lean scotch ale aromas. Lots of wood oak tannin present, but it worked here. If you could taste the smell when you first turn on your furnace in the fall and burn the dust bunnies off it would taste kind of like this. Fortunately, that is one of my favorite smells. Dug this. Glad I have another.","Denver, Colorado, USA","wchesser"
685,"2014-04-06",3.4,"Pours a rich brown color with a frothy tan head. Aroma of dark fruit, nuts and alcohol. Flavor is hazelnut and coffee with an oaky vanilla finish. Smooth on the palate but warms later.","austin, Texas, USA","kidmartinek"

685,"2014-02-25",3.7,"Location: 12 oz bottle from the Hay Merchant, 2/25/14


Aroma: The nose is rich and boozy, whiskey, caramel, vanilla, smoke, some earth and peat

Appearance: It pours a brown color with a slight red hue and a small off-white head

Flavor: The flavor is a little sweet, with rich malts, whiskey, smoke, and some earth too

Palate: The body is fairly full, it has a rich feel, average carbonation, and a little bit of heat

Overall Impression: 
Even in Houston these do not seem that easy to get your hands on. Anyway, finally found the 5th one (I didnt find #6 last week, but maybe I will eventually). This is a pretty nice scotch beer. At this ABV the burn is fairly minimal. All in all, a tasty beer, the barrel aging compliments it nicely.","Hoboken, New Jersey, USA","ben4321"
685,"2014-02-09",3.9,"12oz bottle from a recent trade. Poured into tulip at home. Deep brown, hazy pour with a thin head that disappeared quickly. Nice aroma of caramel, malts, oak barrel and scotch. You get a little cardboard aroma as well. The taste was a nice combination of oak barrel, heavy malts, caramel and toffee, dark fruits, and booze. Heavy full body that you can almost chew. Increased flavor and booze as it warmed. Barrel and booze finish. I really liked this one.","Boca Raton, Florida, USA","Fritz123"

685,"2013-12-20",4.2,"Saint Arnold Bishops Barrel No. 5 has a thin, cream-colored head, an opaque, brown appearance, with little beige chunks suspended throughout, and some lacing left on the glass. The aroma is of rich, very sweet, brown bread crust, strong bourbon, some vanilla, coconut, and alcohol. Taste is of bourbon, vanilla, coconut, brown bread crust, lots of alcohol, dark-roasted malts, and a bit of hop bitterness. Mouthfeel is medium and not cloying, and Saint Arnold Bishops Barrel No. 5 finishes semi-dry, surprisingly mellow, and rich. Overall, this is very well done and more drinkable than one would expect for such a high-alcohol beer. It is really delicious! RJT","Laplace, Louisiana, USA","ronaldtheriot"
685,"2013-11-27",3.7,"Bottle @ Bobbys house. Dark brown pour with khaki head. Bourbon, vanilla, cola, and brown sugar. Lots of rich chocolate and dark fruits, too. Nice oak, as well.

685,"2013-11-24",3.9,"355mL thanks to t0rin0! Pours a clear, deep red with yellow foam. Nice lacing. Nose is cherry liquor, a tad cheesy, mild fumey alcohol. Taste is warming alcohol, cherry liquor, some coconut from the barrel. Rich, dense palate. Solid!","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
685,"2013-11-23",4.2,"Very dark brown in color, this has a beautiful, potent aroma of heavy whiskey or bourbon and alcohol, some vanilla from wood. The flavor is absolutely fantastic, complex and well balanced with hops, roasted malts, and an addicting finish of perfectly balanced chocolate and bourbon/whiskey.This tastes perfect freshly released... Its hard to believe how much better this can get. Just better than perfect!","Kyle, Texas, USA","ansermadide"

685,"2013-11-13",4.1,"Really good. Nice strong sweet aroma, almost like molasses and bourbon. Very Scottish. Nice dark brown color like burnt sugar. Full mouthfeel but the palate was not too heavy. Taste was typical to scotch ale but with good bourbon flavors and caramelized sugar. Some alcohol flavor as well. Another fine edition to the series.","The Colony, Texas, USA","kevinator"
685,"2013-11-11",3.7,"Deep Amber pour, cream head. Vanilla, wood, alcohol, caramel, and alcohol. Great palate, chewy, sticky vanilla, barrel, leather, and caramel. Nice finish, light alcohol, dark fruits and an easy finish.","Dallas, Texas, USA","mar"
685,"2013-11-10",3.4,"(12oz bottle) clear deep coppery pour, ring of fine tan bubbles. Nose is rich, bit of peat and light smoke, caramel, bourbon, and light milk chocolate. Taste of peat, big on alcohol that really detracts, medicinal, bits of vanilla also. Unique beer but either needs time or this misses the mark a little.","Dallas, Texas, USA","thirdeye11"
685,"2013-11-09",3.7,"Dark mahogany with a thin off white head that fades fairly quickly. Nose is molasses, bourbon, and smokey. Taste is the same with a hint of tartness and dark fruit. Scotch character in there with a good deal of sweetness. Slick palate.","Corinth, Texas, USA","jhamp9"

685,"2013-11-06",3.7,"Pours brown with virtually no head. Aroma is all bourbon all the time. Bourbon taste, as well, with oak, caramel plenty of booze. Would probably be even better aged a year or two. Gee, St. Arnold, wouldnt that be nice?","Houston, Texas, USA","dfinney23"
685,"2013-11-06",3.8,"Bottle at the Holy Grail Pub. Pours a reddish-brown color with a tan head. The aroma has a good bit of whiskey, oak and maple notes as well as some peat malt. The flavor is a bit different. At first I get a lot of peaty, smokey Scotch notes but that transitions into oak, toffee, chocolate and cherries. The finish is straight Islay Scotch. Medium to thick mouthfeel and low carbonation. If you like Scotch (the whisky, not Scotch ales), this will be a good beer for you. If you dont, it may not be. Luckily for me I like Scotch and this beer. Good stuff.","McKinney, Texas, USA","Mora2000"
