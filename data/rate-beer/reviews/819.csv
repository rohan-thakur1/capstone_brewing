819,"2015-07-23",4.2,"Pours an orange color with a white head and a good amount of lacing. Nose is rich with floral and grassy Nobel hops. Loaded with flavor on a solid pilsner malt base. The finish is dry and a bit too bitter for my taste. Nevertheless it is a quality, big tasting beer with excellent balance. Full in body and smooth in mouth feel. Really good going down.","Los Gatos, California, USA","loubar"

Such a really nice surprise that I really did not see coming. GB is usually pedestrian and boring when it comes to their beer product. Hipsters flock to their restaurants, and thats usually a bad sign there. But this beer escapes the drab confines of their concrete walls. 

Tons of grassy, hay-like hops, with just a squeeze of lemon to help keep things really bright. A light cracker flavor, hay/straw which really gives the noble hops a chance to shine, and it does. Herbal/leafy notes leave behind a long, lingering refined bitter finish. One of the best imperial pilsners Ive had. Clean, crisp flavors...nothing overly sweet. Very, very nice.","NorCal, California, USA","GG"
819,"2013-10-03",3.5,"8/23/2012. From bottle. Pours pale yellow with a short white head. Malty aromas with hay, grass, hops and light fruit. Some caramel flavors. Not bad.","Chester, Virginia, USA","Beergeek23322"
819,"2013-09-14",2.3,"After seeing the score, Im thinking I got an old bottle. I did not perceive much in the way of pilsner (imperial or otherwise). No hop content either. Mostly a caramelized amber. A bit viscous and rounded too.","Glendale, California, USA","beersearcher"
819,"2013-08-28",3.4,"Swing cap bottle from Homer321, thanks bro. Poured sort of dirty hazy orange/amber with a large rocky super off white head. Aroma of fresh raw dough, green grapes and white raisins, dates and wet nuts. Full chewy body that has a coating syrupy mouthfeel and softer carbonation. Flavor of grassy hops, bitter citrus, grapefruit, grains, dough. Not bad.","Toms River, New Jersey, USA","dmac"

819,"2013-07-29",3.6,"Pours a hazy light amber with a very nice head. Aroma is very pleasant: caramel, bread, cereal, hop aroma is difficult to pin down, dough, some very light cheese, basement aromas, and alcohol. Taste is mostly balanced with a slight nod towards the bitter. Palate is actually the weakest aspect... brief and bitter finish with a lingering deeper bitter. Session-able, impressive, but somehow I would not buy again.","Las Vegas, Nevada, USA","Fantomasus"
819,"2013-06-02",3.2,"Big swing top bottle from Good Bottle Company. Pours a cloudy yellow/orange with virtually no head. I had high hopes this would be hoppy like Sam Adams imperial pils, but this one is lacking. The body is heavy with a lozenge-type quality. I get some cracker and wooden notes here and there, but its a sweeter beer with suggestions of honey and citrus. It doesnt really taste much like a pilsener, Im not sure what it reminds me of other than malt liquor, if I ever found a malt liquor that actually tasted good.","Denver, Colorado, USA","NachlamSie"
819,"2013-05-19",2.9,"Pours a hazy dark gold with a thick white head. Big musty malty aroma. Taste is smooth malty body with lots of earthy hops and vanilla malt notes.

819,"2013-04-17",3.4,"Bottle. Moderate roasted grain for the malt, light herbs and grass for the hops, faint soap and dried leaves for the yeast, with a hint of green wood. Head is average to large, fizzy, slightly off-white with good lacing and is mostly lasting. Color is sparkling clear medium amber. Flavor starts slightly sweet and lightly to moderately acidic, then finishes lightly acidic and lightly to moderately bitter. Palate is on the lighter side of medium, slick with a lively carbonation. Bitter hops flavor, not so much in the aroma, an earthy beer and a good drinking Imperial Pilsener.","hobe sound, Florida, USA","glennmastrange"

Mostly a pils and saaz like character. Flavors are bready and sweet with low grain, grass. A bit earthy and metallic. Clean and crisp finish though. Lively bubbles, dry, not bad. A bit astringent, possibly an off water profile for the style.","Los Angeles, California, USA","BMan1113VR"

819,"2013-01-08",4.1,"Bomber bottle on clearance for $4. Pours slightly hazy orange, stiff white head. Slightly sweet aroma thats hard to place. Taste is clear and crisply bitter. Pleasing finish. Not sure if its ""Imperial"" but its a quite pleasing beer. They were smoking crack to think they could sell it for $9 bottle though with the competition at that price point.","Washington, USA","HughConway"
819,"2013-01-08",3.8,"Poured from a large bottle into a trumpet glass to drink.  The beer had a semi-cloudy dark gold and straw color with many small rising bubbles, and a large, foamy white head with great retention, and excellent cling and lacing.  Its aroma featured crisp hops with floral, citrus, and pine notes, along with some light caramel malt, and a touch of honey.  The beer had a somewhat bitter-sour blend with a strong grainy-earthy taste with some straw, light citrus, and malt.  It had a lively, bubbly fizz with a dry but full composition, and had a medium body and mouthfeel.  Thank you Mom for the nice Christmas present!","Denver, Colorado, USA","Derek881"

819,"2012-11-16",3.8,"Formidable, painted latch bomber.  Hazy, honey colored beer with a fluffy white head -- in short, good appearance.  Cereal, malt, Eurolager aroma. Sturdy hopping, but not smash-mouth, as I would have expected from the  name.  Malty-mashy-sweet, but not sugary.  Backend euro-bitterness.  A mature and well-developed lager. Medium body, but with backbone. Long, Saazy finish.

819,"2012-10-21",3.7,"750mL swing-top poured into a Blvd tulip glass.   Pour leads to a very alluring beer.  Has a dim-golden bodied with a thick, tall, foamy white head.  Very sticky lacing as the head fades.  The commercial description states this is unfiltered, which is surprising because the beer is only lightly hazy throughout the pours.  No trub at the bottom of the bottle.  Aroma is floral/herbal and saaz hops with slightly honey-like and white biscuit malts.   In the flavor saaz hops break through the slightly chewy, biscuit malts.  Has a mild damp lager note.  A small rush of bitterness sets in at the end of the flavor.  Has quite a soft and lush feel on the cheeks and a medium body.  I would prefer a less malty beer, it definitely isnt ""crisp"" but clean, a good meld of strong German hops and clean lagered malts.  I would drink this again but a cleaner more attenuated and less malt-centric beer would be my preference for this beer.","HdG (past: NYC, KS, Rain City), Maryland, USA","beastiefan2k"

819,"2012-09-29",3.8,"Bottle from BevMo: Poured a golden honey color and created a thick fluffy white head. Aroma is pure with high quality barley malt that gives off a floral scent of pollen and a faint whiff of powdered sugar. The flavor is genuinely bready with a minor taste of oats and whole grained wheat that morphs this beer into something more than just an imperial pilsner. This is reminiscent of European strong lagers/pilsners. Had some serious signs of dust floating around which might have been from light struck bottles in BevMos center floor under sun beams or a long shelf life, but this bee still taste fresh and crisp.","Linda Vista, California, USA","SDalkoholic"
