4125,"2017-01-11",4.5,"50cl bottle pours with a dark clear deep purple color body that tosses up nice thick legs. The aroma offers up rich berry jammy nectar yum with slivers of sweet honey in the background. The taste delivers pure rich berry that I dont want to ever stop. Blackberry just runs amuck but restrained. The slick honey hits about midway and then a nice mild dryness takes this to the finish. Wow! This is deep and involved and demands attention. I dont want to stop. Holy moly. Sweet baby Jesus.","Tempe, Arizona, USA","Ibrew2or3"
4125,"2017-01-06",4.3,"Bottle. Deep purple liquid with no head. Aroma of blackberries, honey, light booze, white chocolate, light licorice and light red berries.

Smooth like nothing else.","Stockholm, SWEDEN","VsXsV"
4125,"2016-12-03",4.5,"500 mL bottle. The pour is a dark purple with a couple bubbles on the collar. The aroma is not really fruity. Its balanced and sweet with a light chocolate and a touch of honey. Its balanced, lovely, and wonderful. The flavor is good also really balanced with a great fruitiness and a touch of honey and alcohol. The mouth feel is thinner with a nice fruitiness and a strong honey alcohol on it. The alcohol and honey it a little more controlled but its really balanced and good.","Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA","koleminer20"
4125,"2016-12-03",4.3,"Bottle shared with koleminer20 and Gus, and Benny for the reunion of Meat Cloud and the Bird Dicks. Aroma is booze, blackberry, honey, white chocolate, great.

4125,"2016-11-24",4.7,"Lots of blackberry, less chocolate than regular. Some cheesecake to the taste when cold. More chocolate as it warms, nice slight tartness to the berries to balance out the sweetness.","","knickskicks"
4125,"2016-11-13",4.0,"Soooooo much better than the straw berry bottle i had. The aroma is much cleaner, although not nearly as fruity and rich. Taste is fantastic, getting a lot of honey and chocolate. The blackberry comes through most in the acidity and tannin. Finish is puckeringly tart, almost dry like. Wish the blackberry fruit flavor came out a little more on top of the honey and chocolate, but i cant complain. Delicious mead.","","BrandNewBrew"
4125,"2016-10-19",4.7,"Probably the most sour of the White series and it takes away a little from the amazing white chocolate flavor, but with that said it is still in my top ten meads of all time and is a wonderful sweet honey wine","Oceanside, California, USA","Floydster"
4125,"2016-06-28",3.5,"Sample, 2 oz. Opaque black purple pour. Aroma is super rich, decadent blackberries, ultra perfumy, white chocolate, very very jammy, almost spicy. Taste is pretty rough, tastes somewhat like drinking perfume, nice fruity sweetness but doesnt manage to hide the cloying, artificial feeling white chocolate flavor - mead is nowhere to be found, light lingering tartness on the finish. Palate is full bodied, syrupy and mouth-coating. Drinkable, but only in very small doses.","Trois-Rivières, Quebec, CANADA","JulienHuxley"
4125,"2016-06-07",4.1,"Ceramic flip-top shared at Woodshop 10. Clear inky purple hue. Nose is assertive with big blackberry cobbler and thick jam certainly pull through. That flavor brings some spicy alcohol, rich berry skin tannins. Great interplay of acid and sugar. Palate is super rich, oily, dense. But for some reason, this one didnt ""pop"" for me like the strawberry and blueberry versions.","San Diego, California, USA","GT"
4125,"2016-05-29",4.0,"Bottle - Vanilla and blackberry with some nice honey sweetness. Deep purple. Blackberry bursts our first with a touch of acidity to be nicely balanced with the sweet vanilla. I didnt know how this would work, but I am glad the brewer has a much better imagination than I do. Nice stuff.","Burnaby, British Columbia, CANADA","Ferris"
4125,"2016-05-28",4.1,"Pours dark purple with NO head. Aroma; Black berries, honey, oak vanilla and fruity noter. Taste; Honey, black berries, oak, vanilla and some liqourice.","SWEDEN","Jokestereo"
4125,"2016-05-28",4.2,"Bottle. Pours reddish bluish black while leaving some prominent beautiful legs on the glass. Smell is heavy fruity and vionous with blackberries, bilberries, black cherries, rich honey, charred wood, vanilla, caramel, hay and alcohol. Taste is sweet, sour and heavy fruity. Mouthfeel is round, viscous, oily, tart, tiny astringent, tiny boozy and near full bodied. Finish is sweet and sour with blackberries, bilberries, honey and alcohol. Love it. Plenty of berry acidity balanced by honey and berry sweetness. Sourer than blueberry white which also adds to the complexity.","Göteborg, SWEDEN","_angst_"

4125,"2016-05-25",4.3,"Sample at Art of Wine in Sedona along with the Strawberry. Pours a brownish reddish color. Super still and thick. Aroma is berry jam with white chocolate.

4125,"2016-04-30",4.4,"Sample sent to me out of the blue by kbudd19-- thanks tons for thinking of me buddy! Deepest purple, moderate viscosity. Lovely nose of beeswax, perfumey blackberry, soft oak. Jammy blackberry flavour, very intense, with a highly acidic tartness that keeps it from being too sticky. Honey and rounded oak balance the fruit intensity somewhat, but this is all about the blackberry, no doubt. Loads of tannins in the finish. I love stickies of all sorts, and this really was delicious.","the land of bitumen, beef & beer, Alberta, CANADA","DuffMan"
4125,"2016-04-29",3.9,"2 oz sample from kbudd19, huge thanks for this! Deep purple leaving some really nice legs on the glass. Aroma is intense with loads of blackberry juice, white chocolate, oak, honey, young red wine, mild oak spiciness and a bit of alcohol. Taste is quite sweet but theres a good acidic presence from the blackberry juicel and a rather strong oak presence to balance it at least a bit. Theres also white chocolate, honey, oak spiciness, blackberry jam, alcohol (more than in the aroma but still not too much) and grape juice. Full body. Still. Syrupy mouthfeel with a winey character. Lingering sweet finish with a bit of tartness as well. Some alcohol warmth. Its big, bold and loaded with flavors but its so sweet that it quickly become borderline cloying. Very fun drink to have a small pour of and theres no doubt its tasty but I could never drink a full glass of it. Lack the balance and finesse that theres in Schramms fruited mead but still super solid and it was nice to try.","Quebec, CANADA","tom10101"
4125,"2016-04-24",4.1,"Deep purple pour that is completely still. Hard to distinguish this one from Berry White except for the slightly brighter tint around the edges. Very jammy. Intense flavors reminiscent of Smuckers or an alcoholic Welchs. The alcohol is present but not distracting. Again, delicious and local!","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","BOLTZ7555"
4125,"2016-04-24",4.4,"Dense purple with nice legs. Aroma is blackberry, white chocolate, honey and light vinious undertones. Lots of sweetness up front, followed by blackberry acidic tartness, mixed in with some oak. Thick syrupy mouthfeel. Wow, very good, tons of flavour in this, its very sweet but the acid and tartness from the blackberries really brings it together.","Edmonton, Alberta, CANADA","kbudd19"
4125,"2016-04-19",4.1,"2oz sample from a trade with greenh0rn. Big thanks! Pours deep blue purple. Still. Leaves legs. This actually does smell of white chocolate and blackberry. Some plum as well. Deep blackberry flavor, jammy. A hint of white chocolate in the finish. I see why this series is so highly rated. Very impressive!","Massachusetts, USA","WillRunForBeer"
4125,"2016-02-07",4.0,"Bottle thanks to Miguel for sharing! Aroma is blackberry juice, chalk and plum. Tastes very good. Moderate sweet and moderate tart in the finish. Huge fleshy blackberry with just a hint a white chocolate. Tastes wayyyy better than it smells. Cant wait to try the other since Im guessing this will be my least favorite.","Flat Rock, Michigan, USA","umich03jm"
4125,"2016-02-04",4.5,"Black berry white is the least interesting of the four variants, yet still a really tasty mead. Nose is dominated by honey with berry, chocolate. Black berry jam flavor with just the slightest hint of medicine...almost as if you have to b seeking it to notice. Still wonderful, but just a slight note lower than its white family brethren.","Gilbert, Arizona, USA","JJMBeer"

4125,"2015-10-24",4.8,"Since I am at anniversary party, what's not love when you can try some fantastic meads. This one is a close second to the blueberry, but very comparable in taste body and nose. Like all things having a time and place, had I tried this in the summer on a patio it may have pushed it to the top! Enjoy!","","luchadore"
4125,"2015-09-23",4.6,"500ml bottle from the meadery. Pours still, inky purple red. Aroma is vinous, fruity, and earthy. Taste of deep, dark, tart/sweet fruit, chocolate, and spice. Medium-full mouthfeel. An absolutely tremendous mead, worthy of the white series.","New York, USA","tchaos"
4125,"2015-09-23",4.7,"Pours deep purple. Aroma is Berry, tannins. Flavor is insane. Full on black berry. Tannins, cherry skin. The chocolate comes powering in and mingles perfectly with the jammy Berry. Sweet and tart. Fuller in body insane. Damn!","Fishhawk, Florida, USA","MeadMe"
4125,"2015-09-18",4.8,"Its interesting. When I first tried the blackberry white early on, it was my least favorite of the four. But, now that they are bottled and released - I find I like it a bit more than previously, and as it warms and the tartness comes together with the blackberry notes and white chocolate it actually moves up to maybe a close 3rd favorite amongst the white series...","Phoenix, Arizona, USA","shadbow"
4125,"2015-08-31",3.7,"bottle thanks to Dak, a strong sweet one here. The sweetness doesnt really bother me as much as it does in beer. This one has a strong pronounced berry flavor, lots of chocolate flavors. Finish is candy syrup","Arizona, USA","Ernesto987"

4125,"2015-08-24",4.6,"This is amazing. I get a ton of blackberry and chocolate on the palate. You even can tell on the nose over the sweet aromas of the honey. This has some of the best flavor of all their meads. I could drink gallons!","Arizona, USA","kcorum10"
4125,"2015-08-11",4.0,"Taster at the meadery. The nose on this one is surprisingly both dank and sharp with semi-tart blackberry and a mild earthy chocolate tone buoyed by a decent amount of sugar and a slightly green vegetal note. Dark royal purple in color. Sweet and sour flavors of tart blackberry and rich honey play across the tongue with light vanilla bean and pie dough notes in the background. The alcohol is more hidden than in the other White Series meads. A rather fruity finish. Delicious, but not quite on the same stellar level as Blue Berry White and Straw Berry White.","Arizona, USA","DesertDevil"
4125,"2015-07-26",4.1,"Dark blue/ black appearance with strong aroma of dark berries. Surprisingly light mouth feel with a strong berry and vanilla flavor. A slightly tart taste complements the sweetness.","Prescott, Arizona, USA","jesterthedog1"
