3177,"2017-05-20",3.9,"This is the first time I have tasted Sake, it was on a special promotion at Lidl Longsight Manchester, UK, so I thought I would try it. I bought 2 bottles and tried it that night. As usual I drank some strong Lager and then finished with a bottle of Sake. I loved the gentle taste , but one felt, though the taste was subdued it was a drink to treat with respect, a drink to savor, to sip to enjoy a sophisticated drink. I have been every day to purchase the remaining stock and though I have a couple of bottles left I now need an outlet where I can make regular purchases of say a box at a time. I usually drink red wine, purchased on my regular trips to France I chose a couple of aroma suggestions ,resin, basement aromas, but these do not adequately describe the nose to Sake, I do not think words could describe its aroma, Perhaps I will use my own words to describe it. I thought, base fermented rice with a fruity sweet apple, yes almost a cidre nose, but without the acidity. A smell of the countryside as detected by a lark in flight, cornfield being baked by a hot sun, drying out the dew of the night before . I will adjourn my sojourn into the days of dreams, freedom and the unshackled flight into Utopia as this is hindering me in the importance of the task at hand. the savoring and tasting of this brew of the Gods.","Manchester, Greater Manchester, ENGLAND","PilsnerSensei69"

At least it kind of warms your throat. As sake got warmer it tasted more like sugared water mixed with pure alcohol.

Nose is basic cheap rice sake with medicinal alcohol, boozy, low anis makes it a tad more interesting. Taste is dull sweet, cheap rice, medicinal alcohol, anis from the nose is barley there.

3177,"2014-09-03",1.8,"Asia-Week in Lidl. Sfermentowany ryz w japonii w produkcie niemieckim. Niezbyt to ciekawe polaczenie. Zbyt spora dawka ryzowego posmaku oleistosci i nut etanolu. Zarowno w zapachu jak i w smaku. Nie dla mnie chyba sake, alkohol nie jest w stanie sie ukryc nawet pod spora iloscia fermentujacego ryzu. To sake jest jakby nietrwale w zapachu szybko ulatuje i jest jakby lekko rozcienczone, moze to i dobrze bo alkohol mniej dokucza. W kazdym razie nie polecam.","Radom, POLAND","Grzesiek79"
